CHAPTER VIII.
The Stockholders Wield Their Mighty
Ballots.
I K a slight feeling of panic threat
ened Sledge when he stepped Into
the stockholders' meeting of the
reorganized street railway com
pany nobody knew it, for he sat off to
one side of the president's table, fac
ing the gathering, as heavily indiffer
ent ns ever, his big face expression
less and his small gray eyes gazing
steadily straight ahead at nothing.
Marley was far more nervous than
he, waiting impatiently, gavel in hand,
for Acting Secretary Hunt to finish
his tedious job of clerical work. Con
siderable stock had been brought in
to L« entered on the books, and, as the
certificates were displayed to him.
Hunt, with a lavender silk handker
chief tucked in his cuff, looked occa
sionally across at Sledge, evidently
worried that he could not catch the
eye of the big chief.
Bert Glider was the last man in line
at Hunt's desk, and as he handed over
a large bundte of certificates Hunt
glanced at the name on the back of the
top one and coughed londly. He
scraped his chair. He dropped his
corporate seal on the floor with a loud
clatter, but Sledge looked straight
ahead. Whatever had happened to
him he would know in good time, but
In the meantime he was going to rest
mind and body and nerves, and, if the
big boss had one faculty which more
than another had helped him to suc
cess, this was it—his putty-like iner
tia.
Marley, waiting, gavel In hand and
pulling with rapid strokes at his
goatee, watched this iRtle tableau un
til, with another perspiring glance at
Sledge, Hunt handed back the bunch
of certificates to Glider and closed his
books. Then, at last, the president's
gavel fell, and he announced the spe
cial stockholders' meeting of the Ring
City Street Railway company open for
business.
Immediately he made a neat little
speech to his faithful friends, the
stanch investors, who had believed in
the future of their heretofore prosper
ous organization well enough to hold
to their stock or to purchase more in
the face of apparent adversity. It was
true that certain purely manipulative
transactions had seemed to militate
against the company and had tempo
rarily depressed the market value of
its stock.
Bendix stole a sly look at Sledg6
Bendix stole a sly look at Sledg6
He had never batted an eyelash.
However, the president went on, the
intrinsic value of the stock was still
there, and, with that thought constant
ly In mind, there was no need for a
panic. The stock was worth and
should command par. The improve
ments, for which the reorganization
had been made, were to be carried out,
and others vastly greater were in im
mediate contemplation.
It was a hopeful speech, a rousing
speech, a reassuring speech, and Presi
dent Marley felt when he sat down,
bathed In self approbation and per
spiration. that, there being six re
porters present by special invitation,
he had raised the market value of his
stock from ten to fifteen points.
So impressive was his speech that
little Henry Peters, whose cheeks were
shrunken and pale and whose wrinkle
framed eyes were bleared from the
loss of sleep, turned to his nearest
neighbor and said, with a sigh of re
lief:
"I'm glad I didn't sell my stock day
before yesterday. I almost took thir
ty-five for it, but the man didn't come
back."
His neighbor, a wattle necked mat
with a crooked nose and towlike hail
which swept down his forehead and
curled up over his eyebrows, said
through his nose, like the wheeze of a
penny whistle:
"Nyah; everything's all talk."
Up rose Attorney Tucker, a sharp
nosed little man with beady eyes and
the crisp business air which frowns
on a smile and hates a holiday.
Let his fellow stockholders beware
of too much optimism. He himself
had been, next to President Marley,
the largest individual holder of stock
in the company. He had sold all but
an extremely small portion before the
panic and wished that he hnd sold the
balance, for the outlook was very
gloomy. He did not wish to make his
remarks in the form of a personal ti
rade, but he did feel it necessary to
point out that the downfall and ulti
mate ruination of their company was
due, not to mismanagement, but to
political manipulation.
"Let me tell you the truth P he
shouted. "Wc have with us today,
at this very meeting, a man of tremen
dous power and influence; a politician
of national renown; one who is at this
moment under the searching eye of
the law; an omnipotent friend and a
relentless fee, and this man has cho
sen. for reasons of his own, to wreck.
!
!
j
!
;
I
j
and devastate and turn to useless rust
the Ring City Street railway com
pany."
Every eye was turned to Sledge, but
that omnipotent friend and relentless
foe, without moving a corpuscle, gazed
straight ahead at nothing.
"He is no friend of the working
man!" swore little Henry Peters.
As if infuriated by nis impassive
ness, Attorney Tucker, who was paid
by Sledge for the purpose, figuratively
ripped the big boss up the back, skin
ned him alive, hung up his hide to dry.
and scattered his ashes'to the winds,
painting him as an insatiable monster,
and chiefly calling attention to hts hab
its of ruthless devastation. Wherever
the present street car company hnd a
line the new one would have one on
an adjoining street, with newer and
better and swifter cars, and a doser
schedule, and unless something radical
were done he would net give a con
tinental cuss per bale fir the stock of
the now rapidly dying ufng City Street
Railway company. *
A long low sigh, like the midnight
soughing in a churchyard, arose from
that meeting, as Attorney Tucker sat
down. Little Henry Peters, with a
livid face, clutched thé arm of his
wattle necked neighbor. -
"If that man had only eome back
I could have got thirty-five for my
stock!" he wailed. "Pm ruined. I
shall lose my home! Frank Marley Is
a rotten business man!"
"Yeh!" intoned the crooked nosed
one. "They're all thieve^"
Jim Delaney, who, with a clear eye
and a straight countenance, could make
louder speeches than any man In the
Eighth ward, painted even a blacker
picture than Attorney Tucker, and
when he sat down he had bankrupted
every stockholder withlfythc sound of
his voice. It even semed Incredible
that a street car should jstill be whiz
zing outside. Little Henry Peters sat
numbly, with his hair clutched in his
hands. If he could have swapped his
$9,000 worth of street railway stock for
a jackknife with two broken blades bis
conscience would have hurt him, nnd
every stockholder was in his class.
APisery sat enthroned on every counte
nance.
Daniel B. Atkins, a rising young law
yer, with no capital but an empty con
science and a silver tongue, was th
first Individual since Marjey to offer a
gleam of hope.
He admitted all that the preceding
gentlemen had said and believed, him
self, that the company was reduced to
pauperism unless something radical
could be done. He had believed this
so thoroughly-ttiat he h&s lain awake
nights trying to evolve a plan for their
salvation.
He had evolved It—a scheme where
by tbe company could not only raise Its
stock to par, but place it at a premium;
whereby tbe company could become a
monopoly and extend its business to
meet the growing demands of the city
and become again a 7 per cent divi
dend concern, capable of piling np
again a tremendous construction sur
plus. On his own responsibility he had
gone to the organizer of the rival new
company and had labored with hlm fot
hours to persuade him to come to this
meeting and lay before It a Tather nov
el but life saving proposition. Would
the stockholders permit him to intro
duce the eminent promoter and organ
izer. Mr. Bozzam, who would present
his proposition In person?
The stockholders would. They said
so, with so vociferous and almost tear
ful a clamor that President Marley
could scarcely make himself heard tc
obtain a formal vote on the proposi
tion.
Mr. Bozzam entered, with his hair
not too smoothly brushed nor his
clothes not so immaculate, but he look
ed businesslike nnd sat down quietly
in tbe seat courteously offered him by
President Marley. He was a wide
shouldered man, with a pleasant coun
tenance and a good forehead, who look
ed as if he had muscles under his coat,
and he was well liked by the con
course. Little Henry Peters judged
that he was a keen business man, but
square and said so.
"Wagh!" nasaled the tow haired
neighbor. "I wouldn't trust anybody.'
"How many shares of stock have
you got ?" asked little Henry.
"Three," boasted tbe wattle necked
one. "My brother-in-law give 'em to
me."
Mr. Marley Introduced the caller in
a few, neat, aseptic words. He had
met Mr Bozzam socially and onlv
hoped that he would prove as pleasant
commercially.
Laughing gracefully at this clever
turn of speech. Mr. Bozzam continued
the introduction himself, stating exact
! ly who and what he was—an organizer,
representing a group of eastern capl
! talists devoted to the promotiou and
extension of the street railway Indus
tries. Back of his backers were cer
j taiu huge electrical, steel and car
! building industries. It had been his
pleasure to organize and to put In
shape for immediate construction op
erations a new company in their own
thriving city. They were ready to be
; gin laying rails at once, but it bad been
earnestly represented to him that the
I manufacturing interests of his group
of capitalists would be just as well
j served by permitting tbe uew lines to
be erected by the old company, and
nfter a conference with his principals
It had been decided tbat if the Ring
City Street Railway company wished
to monopolize their legitimately an
ticipated profits this could be done by
the purchase of their franchises and
good will at a purely nominal figure.
A buzz of satisfaction followed this
magnanimous offer, and little Henry
reters was for purchasing the fran
chises immediately.
"I'd have lost all my years of sav
ing if I'd sold my stock at thirty-five,
be told his neighbor.
I don't understand It, but it's a
skin game," announced the crooked
nose man. "Who is this fellow, any
how?"
Mr. Marley turned to Mr. Bozzam
with the frank smile of a gentleman.
"And how much would your company
consider a merely nominal figure?" he
Inquired, with smoothness.
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars cash," stated Bozzam lightly.
Young Daniel B. Atkins Immediately
moved to accept that price.
"No!" hotly yelled Bert Glider.
"I second the motion," announced At
torney Tucker.
"It has been moved and seconded
that we purchase the franchises and
good will of the street car company
represented by Mr. Bozzam for the
sum of $250,000 cash," stated Presi
dent Marley, looking about him with
cool aloofness. "Are there any re
marks ?"
There were—a perfect pandemonium
of them—and out of the battle Presi
dent Marley recognized Attorney Tuck
er.
Attorney Tucker begged leave of the
chair to ask Mr. Bozzam just one ques
tion and received it.
"Have you named your bottom fig
ure?' he wanted to know.
"Positively!" declared Mr. Bozzam,
with vast firmness.
"One more question. Are you em
powered to close this deal?"
"I am." replied Mr. Bozzam. "I hava
a free hand."
Sledge almost looked at the genial
promoter.
"Then we must pay the price," fer
vently asserted Attorney Tucker. "This
Is a gleam of hope in tbe darkness, a
way out of our difficulties, a solution
to our troubles. We have tha cash
to purchase these franchises, which wifi
give us a practical monopoly of the
city's street car business. We can ei
ther Increase our capitalization or issue
bonds to pay for our extensions, and.
in the meantime, the moment v« con
elude this deal our stock jumps back
to par."
Loud cries of "Question!" came from
all over the hall, and little Henry Pa
ters, after the demand had started,
shouted louder than anybody.
Young Daniel B. Atkins wanted to
make a speech and was granted that
privilege.
He was more enthusiastic about pay
ing out that $250,000 than anybody,
and. being a professional w hooper-up,
he used his clarion voice and silver
tongue to such good advantage that
the throng was with difficulty restrain
ed from rushing up to Bozzam and
paying him the money on the spot.
In defiance of the madly expressed
wishes of the multitude, however. I'rea
Ident Marley recoguized Bert Glider.
"Move to amend the resolution to
read fifty thousand In place of two
hundred and fifty!" he shouted.
"Second the motion!" yelled a big
mouthed young man sitting next to
him.
Mr. President," exclaimed Mr. Boz
zam, rising to his feet, "that amend
ment Is positively useless."
A frantic hubbub arose The hall
was a sea of open mouths. Little
Henry Peters held his mouth open
wider than any stockholder present
One could see his tonsils perfectly.
He was helping to how! down Bert
Glider's absurd amendment
President Marley tapped his gavel
energetically.
"I perceive that it Is useless to
waste time on speeches against this
amendment," he announced. "Are
there any remarks to be made in favor
of it? Tbe chair will permit five min
utes for such argument." He waited
moment No one arose. Attorney
Tucker stood up.
"If the chair please"— he began.
"Are you about to speak in fnvor of
this amendment?'' Interrupted the
chair.
"No," replied Attorney Tucker.
"The chair refuses to recognize the
gentleman," announced the president
"The secretary will take a roll call
vote on the amendment"
They endured that as men do, only
venting their emotions by the vehe
mence of their "No!" on the roll call
vote. A scant few had the temerity to
vote "Yes" and were nearly mobbed
for their daring. The most of them
kept their eyes on Bozzam In fearful
anxiety lest, offended by this proceed
ing, he might withdraw his generous
offer and walk out. leaving them doom
ed to extinction by his mighty rivalry.
"Albert T. Gllder/L called the secre
tary. "a thousand shares."
"Yes," voted Bert and curled both
sides of his mustache, looking across at
Sledge and grinning. He had the In
tense satisfaction of seeing Sledge
turn, but was disappointed after all
Sledge did not look at him, but at
Hunt.
There followed another wilderness of
"No's!" voted by holders of from five
to a hundred shares each.
"B. Franklin Marley," called Hunt,
and this time he caught Sledge's eye,
"4,020 shares."
"Yes!" voted Marley, with a snarllng
ly triumphant laugh at Sledge, a laugh
which showed his teeth and made his
nose an acute triangle down over them,
like the point of a pen.

Whin Kissing Was Costly.
The case of the people against Mur
line, heard by the governor of New
naven colony in council on May day,
1G60, indicates the attitude toward un
licensed kissing in those times. It ap
pcared that Jacob Murllne and Sarah
Tuttle had been ennght kissing each
other. Jacob tried to throw the blamf
on Sarah, saying he thought she bad
"with Intent let fall her gloves." Sa
rah denied the intent. Jacob then ad
mittcd that be "tooke her by the band
and they both sat down upon a chest
but whether he kyssed her or she
kyssed him he knows not, for he nev
er thought of it since until Mr. Ray
mond told him that he had not layde it
to heart as he ought." The stern gov
ernor, after duly lecturing the guiltj
parties on the enormity of their of
fense, decreed that "the sentence there
fore concerning them is that they shal'
pay either of them a fine of 20 shil
lings to the colony."
Ramesss I.
Raineses I. was the first king of the
nineteenth dynasty in Egypt and ruled
for a brief period about B. C. 1355. Be

Nubia, where he left an Inscription and
constructed some of the buildings of
the Karnak, little Is known of his
reign. His mummy was found in 1881
at Dclr-e!-Bn!irl. His son, Seti I., built
th* Memnonlum at Karnak in honor
of Ms father's memory.

An Artist's Criticism.
Falguiere. the sculptor, told a capital
story of Henner, the great artist, who
although he lived in Paris all his life,
never lost his Alsatian peasant ac
cent or his country manners. But
Ileimer was a very keen critic and
had a clever way of showing Ids dis
like of wordy enthusiasm. Falguiere,
whose talent as a sculptor is known all
the world over, was very fond of [taint
ing, but lie did not paint particularly
well. One day Ilenner was In his
studio, and Falguire showed him some
of his pictures.
"What do you think of this one?"
asked Falguiere.
"Superb!" said Ilenner, with his AI
sation accent. "Marfeious!"
"And this one?'
"Brodltchous!"
"And tills one?"
