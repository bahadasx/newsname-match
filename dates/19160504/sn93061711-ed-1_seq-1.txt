Mint!." This piny has been very suc
cessful on the stage with Nut Good
win in the lending role. It is a blend
ing of clever plot, sparkling dialogue,
and strong characters. There is a
delicate play of satire throughout the
whole performnnco.

Tucumcari as u candidate for the nom
ination of county clerk, subject to the
action of tho Democratic primary.
Dr. Manney is an old timer in Tu
cumcari and Quay county, having nr
rived here in 1900. He purchased
property in 1007, built the Home San
itarium, and moved his family to Tu
cumcari, He immediately began the
practice of medicine and in a short
time had a nice business built up.which
hi- has continued I) enjoy ever since.
With reference to residence in Tu
cumcari, he is the oldest physician in
the city. He has always supported
eery cause that has been for the up
building of the city and county, hav
ing contributed to the building of a
number of the school houses in the
county.
He has never refused to go when
called to see the sick and distressed,
or turned them down, no matter how
far thoy lived from Tucumcari. or
asked before going whether thoy had
the money.
He was born in Chcrokcu county,
Texas, reared principal!1, in central
Texas. Finishing his high school ed
ucation, he entered the drug business
and began the reading of medicine.
In 1880 he went to California, and en
tered the Stockton Business and Nor

18H2. In 18!3 he returned home and
began teaching in tho public schools,
holding a first grade state certificate.

but will appreciate it very much if
his friends will call on him when in
town and talk the matter over with
him.
He is a self-made man and under
stands from personal experience what
it means to grapple with the world
for existence, having been reared an

county clerk will uso his best judfj.
ment in nttending to tho people's ev
ery want
Gnrrett's is absolutely tho boat plnco
In Tucumcari to buy shoos best for
Garrett, and best for you.
LOGAN HAD IMG TIME AND
IHG CROWD LAST SATURDAY
A number of the Tucumcari citizens
went to Logan last Saturday to at
tend the big doings. They report a
good crowd from Quay county and a
good crowd from Union county.
There were numerous speakers dur
ing the day and the big feast at noon
was said to have been the greatest ev
er held in tho county.
The county commissioners got a hot
shot from a Logan doctor, who spoke
on "Sanitation." Ho dragged the poor
commissioners over the coals because
they would not be a party to a hold
up scheme. It is understood thnt he
said they only allowed him $1.50 for
each professional visit and r0 cents a
milo for traveling expenses. This is
a flora; charge against the county com
missioners, and this doctor said they
should have paid him $2.00 a visit and
$1.00 per mile for traveling expenses.
Of course the commissioners are put
in just to spend the money and see
that it is all spent, but the present
members of the board were not in
structed to do it thnt wny. They had
been told that they should make the
money go as far as possible and see
that it was paid out rightfully and
economically. Of course most of us
want all the money we can get, and
some would even rob wiuowa and or
phans to secure the "kale," but this
unintended compliment to the county
commissioners is certainly appreciated
by the ones down this way.
During tho day the girls of Tucum
cari defeated the Logan girls in a fust
game of basket-ball by a close score.
Those who had the pleasure of visit
ing Logan were well paid for thctr
time and spoke highly of the treat
ment accorded them while in the city
on the Canadian.
JORDAN WANTS THE ELEVATOR
Everybody is feeling fine over the
good rains which fell last week, and
wo have bettor prospects for a bum
per wheat crop than ever before.
Now, if Tucumcari wants to get her
part of this wheut she will have to get

Where we've rattlesnakes plenty and

And the night birds whistle, "Casey

Where the coyote's scalp brings fifty
cents,
And the bull-bat sleeps on the barbed
wire fence;
Where the Mexican quail and the whip-poor-will
Join in the chorus of "Steamboat
Mill,"
Where the whito-faccd cattle and tho
broncho steed,
(io out and nibble the loco weed,
And the farmer subsists on beautiful
scenes,
with an occasional feast on rabbit and
beans.

MRS. ISRAEL RUN OVER 1IY
FORDIS HADLY INJURED
Quite a bit of excitement was cre
ated today shortly after noon, when
Mrs. Joseph Israel was run over by
a Ford and bruised up pretty badly.
It is reported that her shoulder is dis
located and she is otherwise badly
bruised. She was picked up and taken
to Dr. Ferguson's ofllce and remained
unconscious for several minutes.
After she regained consciousness
she was taken to her home and as wo
go to press is reported to be resting
very well.
The car was coming north on 1st
street on the left-hand side and while
not running very fast it was not no
ticed by Mrs. Israel until it was right,)
upon her. It was driven by u woman
who evidently could not stop the car
in time to avoid the accident, but did
not stop after passing over Mrs. Is
rael's seemingly lifeless body. Mrs.
Israel was evidently directly in front
of the car and fell beneath the center
as the wheels did not pass over her
body.
This should be the end of such driv
ing and nn effort will bu made to
have the city council put in sign posts
at tho center of the main streets in-
structing the auto drivers which way
they must turn the corners and to nl- I
ways keep tho right hund side of tho
street. If this system had been used
Mrs. Israel would not have been ser
iously injured and other accidents will
bo avoided.
NICE RAIN AT KIRK
The plains has u fine seasoa now
and it is still threatening rain. Wheat
is looking well. People are busy try
ing to plant between showers.
School closed last Saturday night
with n nice little program. Owing to
tho lock of room the exercises were
conducted out of doors, and the wind
came up from the east, making it
very disagreeable. The attendance
was good considering the inclement
weather.
C. E. White and Miss Grace Mason
from near I ma were over to attend
the school closing and while here they
were the guests of Miss Stnlcup.
A goodly number of our ciM..ens
are installing telephone boxes, since
we have a switch-board.
Raymond Reagan has been on the
sick list tho past few days; also Miss
Stnlcup had quite a sick spell since
school closed.
Mrs. Morgan is able to be up now,
and Mr. Morgan has gone to ClovW,
whore ho has wok.
SIMPSON PARDONED
Santa Fe, May 2. Tho governor to
day pardoned Walter Simpson of Quay
county, convicted of larceny in the dis
trict court and sentenced to a year.
After he had served five months the
Mupreme court affirmed the case and
issued a new commitment for a year.
The governor held it was simple Jus
tice to release Simpson after lie had
served the original yenr.
D. K. THOMPSON
Mr. D. K. Thompson was born in
Nevada county in 1871. When he was
a young man after trying various pro
fessions, be took up the furniture bun
ness, locating in Denison, Texas, where
he attained next to the largest firm.
During the fourioen years in this lo
cation and business lie was nlway-. es
teemed as the very highest in stabil
ity and integrity.
In 1010 he was married to Mis. Mae
Peyton and they owned a beautiful
home on West Sears St. in Denison,
where they at once went to house
keeping nnd lived happy years. A
little boy came to bless the home, ami
he is now four years old.
In HIM he was stricken with ill
health and went west seeking relief.
He lived in Tucumcari, N. M.. fniif
teen months. His capable wife intro
duced art in the public schools, gain
ing much patronage in that lint, as
she was an artist of rare ability.
Mr. Thompson gained many friends
when he was able to be out, but last
December he contracted la grippe,
which weakened him more, and lie nev
er recovered from its effects, causing
a throat trouble. For several weeks
there was no hope of his life being
saved. The end came on Monday Mar.
27th, at 0:30 p. in. when he passed
peacefully to rest and he is free from
all pain nnd sorrows of this world.
Resides his wife and little son. his
wifo's mother, Mrs. Kate Peyton, were
at his bedside when he died.
The remains were carried to his old
home for interment, at Emmet, Ark.,
and were accompanied by his relatives
He was a member of the Methodist
church. He has two brothers and two
sisters, who live in Arkansas. XX

F. M. Horry, who with his wife,
hnvo been residents of Quay county
for a number of years, proving up on
a farm southwest of town, have sold
their stock, form and other things,
and will leave this week for Cedar
Glades, Arkansas, to make their fu
ture home. Mrs. Horry's father is
getting too old to tako care of his
business interests and it is his desire
to have Mr. and Mrs. Horry come and
assist him. Thoy have made many
friends during their stay in New Mex
ico and will no doubt return some day
to the land of "sunshine."
CONCERT HY PHILHARMONIC '
SOCIETY A HUGE SUCCESS
On Thursday night, April 27, it was
the good fortune of a large number of
appreciative persons to hear the best
conceit ever presented on a Tucum
cari stage. The program was mado up
of such music as we want our children
to grow by, our women to bum as they
go about their work, our men to whis
tle as they fulfill their daily duties in
street or shop or office, the perpetual
kind. Rarely does a town of this size
get tho chance to hear its interpreta
tion by such artists as Mr. Witte and
his able assistants. Rarely in any
town arc its various talents, its sep
arate musical entities welded so har
moniously into so nowerful a unit for
the good of that town. Rarest of all
is this opportunity which has come to
us In the altruistic wonder worker,
tho far-seeing and discerning man
ager who leaves out no detnil neces
sary to the perfection of his task, the
clever and capable music master and
director, the ruling spirit of a move
ment for which our grand-children-and
I hope even wo in our day and
generationshall surely rise up and
call him blessed, Mr. Hoering.
Looking over the sea of faces in the
audience ono exclaimed instinctively,
these are the patrons of art, the
Lorenzo do Medicis of Music. These
are thoy who aro able to recognize at
once what is best in music nnd what
is best for Tucumcari."
The above is the opinion, so well ex
pressed, of u citizen whose words
should carry great weight, for the
writer has watched tho growth of Tu
cumcari from its infancy, and is one
of our most public spirited people.
Mr. Herman Ilfeld, a prominent cit
izen of Las Vegas, who has traveled
extensively in Europe and the United
States, was present at the concert, and
was overheard to remark, "I never
dreamed it possible for a town of the
size and age of Tucumcari to carry
out such a big musicul undertaking
to such a remarkably successful ter
mination. It seems impossible to be.
lieve it."
Another competent judge remarked
that he had never heard tho equal if
the Tucumcari Philharmonic Concert
even in towns of ten thousand Inhnh
itants. So, it would seem that if Tu
cumcari is proud of her Chora! So
ciety, she has just reason to lie so.
We at least know enough to recognize
a good thing when we sou It, and par
ticularly so when wo have it in oar
IIIHISI. K A
Pnrvin Witto has been accurately
described as "the great American ten
or," and his magnificent won; at the
Philharmonic Concert fully justified
the estimate. He was. of course, re
called many times, and graciously re
sponded. It i- not generally Known i though
some of our local musieinn-t guessed
it) thut Rev. Mr. Hoeriuw was a con
cert violinist tor about twenty year
before he entered the ministry of the
Episcopal church. He has appeared,
with distinguished succes. , at some
of the most Impoitant concert;- n
Europe and the United States, and
has even been compared with the great
Emile Saurot. His most recent tri
umph was when lie direi-tod the Chi
cago Symphony Orchestra (then ac
knowledged to be one of the finest in
tho world) in conjunction with a chor
us of over two hundred professional
artists. It would seem that if Tu
cumcari had not recognized his .;tnt
nent ability, which he has consecrated
to tho service of bis church, even the
very stones would have cried out.
Tho other local talent, which "On
sistcd of Mrs. I). .1. Finegan, Mis?
Juanita Shaft", Miss Georgiana Gard
ner, Miss Edith Edwards, and Roht.
Hurnet, rose to the occasion, and did
splendid work. Miss Nelms proved a
capable concertmeister. and the Witte
Male Quartet, consisting of Messrs.
Hillings, Andrews and Coggcstmh.
with Mr. Witte in the lead, fully jus
tilled their reputation u artists of
the first rank. XXX
The dance and ice cream supper
given by the Catholic young ladies at
the opera house Monday, was well at
tended. Nineteen couples purchased
tickets for the whole evening, while
many others danced, paying as they
danced. The now musicians, Ayers
and Sackett. were engaged to play for
the dance and made a hit with thoir
music. Everything went oft" nicely
with the exception of a young mnn
who tried to raise a rough house with
the floor manager. The ollicers soon
took charge of him, it is understood,
and the dance went on.
W. S. Hodges and wife left yester
day morning for Campana, where they
will visit Mrs. Hodges' folks. From
there they will go to Santa Fo to visit
Mr, and Mrs. linen, before leaving for
their new homo in San Francisco, at
which place he has accepted a good
position with a paper company.

tho towns on the railroads and then
bring them back to Tucumcnri for n

Other mutters of business were in

for such an organization. It is also
suggested that the program committee
get busy and got up an intorasting
bunch of speakers, and othtr things
that will put more life into the organization.
TWO NEW MARSHALS
Tucumcari is well supplied with city
police. It has two day men and two
night men. Mayor Israel appointed
Tom Horton ns day mun und John
Akin us night man. Those appoint
ments were confirmed last Friday at
the regular meeting of tho council.
Tho former nembers of the polic
force were instructed by Mr. David
son, to they say. to keep their stars
und continue their work, us Mr. Israel
hns no right to nlllrm his own appoint
ments. Messrs. Prentice nnd McElroy, not
ing for the city, will go to Iinton the
first of the week where on Monduy
the contest cr.se will be honrd before
Judge Loib. There nro numerous sur
prises in store for the citizens of Tu
cumcnri, so it is snid, und the major
ity of us nro sorry to see such trouble
brought into the courts. There is no
telling where it will end.
A. C. Cooley, of tho State Agricul
tural College, gave an illustrated lec

showing the great benefits derived
from securing a county agent for this

Fred Walther was in from Puerto
this week to attend tho special moot

is a candidate for re-election and says
his friends nre doing their part to se
cure his nomination. He stands for
roads to the plains and does not fa

The road to the farms first then the
auto pikes. Pretty fair logic too. and
