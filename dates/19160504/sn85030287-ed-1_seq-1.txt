Saturday Night Thoughts
By R. M. PAINTER
- All alone in the solitude of our
own thoughts this Saturday night
comes fleeting1 o'er our mind
these principals of pure living,
the thought of the brotherhood
of mankind. No man has a right
to demand of another a greater
measure of right liying than be
himself exercises toward his fel
lows. Before any should assume
the attitude of a teacher of right
tiring be must be clean, spotless,
law abiding, 'exercising charity
towards those with, whom ' be
comes in contact. Before any
man assumes the role of a para
gon of right living, his own life
should be a living example,, of
right doing and that because it
is right and not for the reason
that the law compels, unreserve
ably, cheerfully, gladly doing
those things tbattend to the bet
terment of mankind, always hav
ing in mind that decency means
cleanliness, respects for the
right of others not a license to
criticise and scold others for the
things be himself indulges in.
..Parity of living speaks louder
'and. goes -farther 'toward. - the
worlds , betterment than much
speaking by one ; posing "as a
teacher, and who demands a
stricter observance of statutory
or moral law than he observes
himself. No one should claim
mmnnity from the rules of right
living be exacts from others. No
b is an exception to this rule.
Nor does the advocacy of the
same meet the requirements of
good citizenship, one must meet
the fall measure of right doing.
The teacher of righteousness to
be effective must do righteous
ness, must respect the feelings
of others and obey the law as an
example to his fellow man, hav
ing faith in the people where he
sojourns. Man's purity in bis
. everyday life his sunshiny and
charitable disposition will add
much to man's betterment. The
teacher or preacher who is
always faultfinding, grouchy,,
scolding in his disposition ques-
. tinning and charging others with
wrongdoing will never be able to
lead men to right living. Man
will never be lead to the paths
that wind upwards to the land of
the Leal by those whose lives
don't come' up to the standard of
their teaching.

Sweet Trial At Syracuse
Dodge City, Kansas, April 21
'Archie Sweet is innocent, and
at the proper time I can prove it
as conclusively as circumstantial
evidence can prove anything,!'
was the statement of J. P. Zu-i
nick today; Zunick says be has
been working on the case prac
tically from the' time Nellie
Byers was murdered and Sweet
surrendered himself to the cus
tody of the officers,
v "My case is now complete,"
Mr. Zunick said. "I have been
all over the state and have inves
tigated every clue that 1 could find
There are only 280 men in that
county and I have interviewed
274 of them, and not one of them
could sit on a jury and give Sweet
an impartial trial, in my opinion.
In fact, 104 of the men I talked
to said they couldn't act as jur
ors in the case. I don't believe
there is a man in Grant county
who doesn't believe Sweet guilty.
I don't beliete he could be given
protection in the. county if be
were taken there for trial and a
mob wanted him."
' Mr. Zunick says he has been
working as a detective for twenty
six years. He was working as a
farm hand in the vicinity of the
crime when it was committed
and at once started work on the
case. He claims the evidence he
has unearthed will be sufficient
to convict the person guilty of
the Byers murder, but he will
not divelge any of the evidence
nor give a bint of the, name of
the person he suspects.
The Archie Sweet trial will be
'held at Syracuse', on May 22. la
formation to this effect was re
ceived today in a letter from
County Attorney H. W. Stubbs,
of Grant county.
It had first been thought Sweet
would be tried at New Ulysses,
the county seat of Grant county,
where the crime occurred. Lat
er plans were made for a change
of venue to Dodge City, which is
in another judicial district.
Judge George J. Downer is the
judge of the judicial district
where the crime was committed,
and he lives at Syracuse, where
the case bas been set for trial.
The trial of Archie Sweet prom
ises to be a spectacular one.
Thr youth is charged with the
outrage and murder of Nellie
Byers, a school teacher, who was
waylaid by some ruffian, and
whose nude body was found bid-
deu in a ravine.
The only . evidence against
Sweet is the purely circumstan
tial evidence that be was near
the scene, of the crime, by bis
own admission, and saw the
school teacher at a distance, as
Bhe was starting for home the
afternoon of the tragedy. .
Other than this, there is no
evidence against Sweet. On the
contrary, prints of the teeth
marks on the. girl's body abso
lutely do not fit the. mouth of
Archie Sweet, according to the
dentist who made the cast.
Sweet is poor and has no fund
with which to employ lawyers,
but be will be defended by J. I.
Shepherd, an attorney of Fort
Scott, where Sweet formerly
lived, who bas volunteered bis
services. County . Attorney
Stubbs will be assisted in the
prosecution by Attorney Gener
al Brewster,. Hutchinson News

J. T. HELM
To Our Customers
To Whom it May Concern:
. Some time ago we announced,
in starting in as a new firm, that
we would make known oar terms
later.'.'
Our experience in that it takes
one dollar to carry a stock ot
goods and two dollars to carry
credit accounts, or, in' other
words, "We have three thousand
dollars invested, one thousand in
merchandise, while it takes two!,
thousand dollars to carry the
credit sales. It is our. desire to
over-come this situation, if pos
sible. We have frequentlybeen
asked by a customer, "Why is it
that you charge me the same
price for an article that you 4
charge my neighbor, when I al-,
ways pay cash and be gets the
article charged on your books
from tbree to six months and of
ten for a longer time?"
The only way we could honest- .
ly answer this question was by
saying, "You must help to pay ,'
for our carrying this neighbor's
account." Is this right?
The farmers of to-day are
teaching we Hardware and Im
plement dealers how to do busi
ness. Go out toany farmer's
Bale and what do you find in the
way of terms? Signs posted
conspicuously here and there an
nounce them after this fashion,
"All sums under $10.00 are casb.
Sums over $10.00 a discount of a
certain per cent will be allowed
if settled by cash. Amounts not
settled by casb must be settled
for by bankable notes. No goods
to be removed until settled for
with the clerk of the sale,"
'We borrow money it the bank
to carry these accounts, which
we cannot afford (o do. This is
also a discrimination against the ,
casb buyer. One customer pays
casb, anptber.asks for .me; and
we want the trade of Wh and
will gladly extend credit to any
one deserving it.';
In consequence we have adopt
ed the following plans: It costs .
us ten per cent to borrow money
with which to carry credit ac-
counts, and it costs us from two
and one-half to three per ceat to
pay a book keeper to keep ac
counts straight, including the
cost of necessary day books, led
gers, etc. .
As a result, this is our an
nouncement to our trade:"
We will give every customer a
discount of five per cent on every
purchase if settled by casb on
date of sale or delivery of goods. '
On all accounts charged or
posted to our ledgers we will
give a discount of two and one-
balf per cent if paid within thirty
days.
On accounts which are settled
in full after thirty days and be
fore tbe expiration of three
months, our regular retail price
will be charged. No discount
whatever allowed.
We will give every customer
who is worthy of credit, ninety
days time without interest.
After an account has run for
ninety days we will charge tea
per cent interest on same.
In other words, we will give ,
more than our cost of bookkeep
ing, which is about two and one
half to tbree per cent to the cash
customer who has no account to '
keep. ' "
Is this not fair?
These terms will , take effect
on tbe 10th day of May, 1916.
