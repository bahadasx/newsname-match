General Obregon Is Pledged
His Available Strength Into the Move; Will Utilize
23,000 Men for Border Patrol Work.
PASo; May 3. Mexican mili
tary men believe that the with
drawal of the American troops from
Mexico will take place In about two
inonthH, It was learned here tonight.
American officcm will not comment
on the subject.
The Mexicans say tlu.t in view of
the disposition to lie made by Gen
eral Alvaro ( ibregon in carrying out
the tentative agreement made with
General Hugh L. Scott, the hunting
down of the bandit groups ill Chi
huahua anil Dutango can scarcely
take more than that period of time.
On assurance from (ieneral Car
ranza that the bandits are dispersed
the northward movement of Ameri
can troops will attain full speed and
it will not be long until the last troop
er crosses over the International
boundary line.
In the meantime, it was pointed
out, there would lie constant move
ments northward of American de
tachments so that when the final or
der for withdrawal comes there will
be only a part of the present expedi
tionary force left on Mexican soil.

Answers to the lone dispatches sent
today to Washington by General
Scott and to Queretaro by General
Obregon, were not expected to be re
ceived here before tomorrow. In case
the terms settled upon by General
Scott and General obregon are ap
proved by President Wilson and Gen
eral Carranza the present negotiations
will practlcnlly be concluded, al
though the formality of another con
ference will be gone through.
it is probable that no American
troop movement will be begun until
the formal signing of an agreement
by the two governments or ut least
until General Carranza has signified
his acceptance of the conditions
stipulated by the Washington gov
ernment. After that, however, the Mexican
and American troops are expected to
begin at once a co-operative cam
paign that will effectively stamp out
the various bandit groups.
Gradual Itctlrc incut.
It Is generally understood here that
the first step to be taken will he a
gradual retirement northward of the i
American forces, while the Carranza I
troops plunge into the campaign
against the Villlstas. I

the national guard us proposed by thu

ated a military reserve of approxi

was tentatively agreed to today by the

ate's provisions for the national guurd

which would reqtdre enlisted officer

temporarily at least, when they

reserve of tho senate bill and after
spirited debate the matter was passed
over without action. This proposed
a force of JtiO.OOO men which was
twice saved In the senate by a vote
