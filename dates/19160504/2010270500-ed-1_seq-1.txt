a jump, upsetting the buggy and
throwing Crego out in such a way
as to strike his right footon the ce
ment walk on the opposite side of
where the rig was standing. Had it
been his head instead of his foot it

but as it is he is able to get around
on a pair of crutches. His foot is
badly swollen' and very painful, and
it will perhaps be several weeks be
fore he can wear his shoe again.

Sioux City Journal, 2nd: Frank
B. Buckwalter will be the next presi
dent of the Rotary club to succeed
T. B. Hutton. The primary election
of the club was held yesterday. Mr.
Buckwalter received fifty-four votes,
or more than half of the votes cast.
This makes him the sole candidate
for that office at the general elec
tion, which will be held in two weeks.
... .The time limit within which the
Combination Bridge company was
privileged to pay off the debt against
it and redeem the big Missouri river
span from sale at auction expired
last night at midnight with the debt
unpaid. F. L. Eaton, president of
the company and receiver for the
property, under appointment of
Judge Henry T. Reed, of the United
States district court, had announced
that the indebtedness could not be
met and that the bridge would have
to go to the highest bidder. The
.mortgage of the Union Trust com
pany, of Indianapolis, against the
structure amounts to $500,000. In
naming Mr. Eaton special master in
chancery to sell the bridge, Judge
Reed also ordered that no bids less
than half a million dollars be consid
ered in disposing of the property.
Mr. Eaton within a few days will
announce the date of the sale. The
auction will be held in front of the
Woodbury county courthoune. It is
expected that interests representing
James J. Hill, owner of the Bur
lington and Great Northern rail
roads, will bid for the bridge. Re
ports indicate that the Hill lines
want the bridge for an entrance into
Sioux City. The Burlington road is
now using the Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Omaha bridge
through an agreement with the lat
ter company.
Sioux City Journal, 29: The com
bination bridge is to be sold at pub
lic auction after May 1 unless the
bridge company redeems a $500,000
mortgage held on the structure by
the Union Trust company, of Indi
anapolis, before that date. The or
der for the sale was made by Feder
al Judge Henry T. Reed. F. L.
Eaton, receiver for the bridge and
one of the officers of the bridge cor
poration, yesterday asserted that
there was no possibility of the com
pany taking up the mortgage. "I
don't see how we can do it," Mr.
Eaton said. "Wo have been trying
to pay off the mortgage for the last
three years and have not been suc
cessful. The bridge will have to be
sold." The signed order of Judge
Reed authorizing the sale accompan
ied a decree of the court foreclosing
the half million dollar mortgage
held by the Indianapolis company.
Tho mortgage was foreclosed April
21, the decree shows, but it was not
received by J. II. Bolton, deputy
clerk of the United States court, un
til yesterday. Terms under which
the bridge is to be sold to tho high
est bidder were outlined by Judge
Reed in the order. Mr. Eaton, the
receiver, is appointed special master
in chancery by the court to conduct
the sale. The salo will be held in
front of tho Woodbury county court
house on a date to be designated by
Mr. Eaton. He is instructed to give
notice of the salo by publication of
notices in one or more Sioux City
newspapers. All bidders except the
trust company holding the mortgage
will be required to post a $10,000
certified check on any national bank
of New York City or Sioux City.
The check of the highest bidder will
be taken as part paynient of the
purchase price. Judge Reed has or
dered that no bid less than $500,000
be received by the master in chan
cery. In case the bridge company
should "redeem tho mortgage Judge
Reed names the Security National
Farm Notes.

COKN ON ALFALFA SOI)
When corn is planted on alfalfa
ground for grain production too
great a growth of fodder should be
avoided. The College of Agriculture
suggests three ways in which this
may be done. In the first place list
ing is preferable to surface planting,
providing alfalfa has been plowed
under in the fall or early spring and
the plowing has been shallow. If it
has been done late or very deep, of
course it would be impossible. A
second method of reducing the fod
der is to plant the large corn rather
thin, perhaps two-thirds to three
fourths of a stand. This is an easy
matter with tho lister by a change
of plates or sprockets. It is also
easily done with nn edge drop plant
er, but with the round hole drop it
may not be so easily done. The
third method of reducing the fodder
growth is to plant a small variety.
On many farms some early corn is
planted. The best place to put this
is op alfalfa ground, since it grows
less 'fodder and requires less moist
ure than the larger corn and also
stands a chance of maturing before
the drouth that usually comes in the
later summqr. Of course Where
corn can be used for silage or for
fodder it is a good practice to plant
a large variety and to plant it thick.
PLANTING POOR CORN THICKER
On account of the condition of the
seed corn this year there may bo a
tendency to plant thicker than usual
to make up for poor germination.
The College of Agriculture says that
this is a doubtful practice. Often
the germination is better than ex
pected and too thick a stand results.
It seems better to use corn that will
germinate well if such is to be had
in the community and then plant on
ly the usual amount.
TO ACCEPT FREE HIGH SCHOOL

Dire -i.ons for mixing and applying
Up vray materials may be had by
wi i ng to the Department of Hor-
bank as the depository. The bridge
company, if it takes up the mort
gage, must pay $500,000 and 5 per
cent interest from June 30, 1915.
The Indianapolis Trust company
purchased a $700,000 bond issue of
the bridge company on July 1, 1895,
taking as security a mortgage. Two
hundred thousand dollars of the is
sue has been taken up by the bridge
company, leaving half a million dol
lars unpaid. The suit to foreclose
the mortgage was filed last fall.

Mr. Raymond Quintal,
Dakota City, Neb.
Dear friend:
We received your letters April 4th
and found them very interesting.
We are having nice spring weather.
Hayden is a very good place for
pasturing cattle sheep arid horses.
There isnt much farming land here,
altho there is some farming land on
the highlands. My father has- 1G0
acres of pasturing land and 40 acres
of farming land.
The poneys are very cheap here.
You can get a nice little poney for
$5.00 and some times you can get
them as low as $2.50.
We havent any large rivers close
to Hayden, but there beautiful, there
is a small stream running past our
place. There is two stores a post
office blacksmith-shop small hotel. -
We usually do not have much
winter but it is very cold, all tho
rivers and canals are frozen and we
have good skating. But this winter
we had lots of snow, but we hadnt
any skating.
I am in the six -;rade and 13
years old. My tc .r name is Mrs.'
Parks.
We came1 out hero about four
years ago but havent lived here
much.
Tho Indians are very interesting
to me, but 1 am afraid of them.
Some of them live in log houses but
most of them live in wigwams.
They dress in large blanket mostly
in red yellow, purple, or green, just
any bright colors they like best.
When they have the bare danco
they dress in rich silks and havo
them covered with beads, and shells.
I do not know what they have tho
bare dance for but if you wish to
know, I will try and find out and
tell you in my next letter, hoping to
hear from you soon.
Your friend
Fern Garnder.
