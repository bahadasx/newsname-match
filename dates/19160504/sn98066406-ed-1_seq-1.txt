The Junior Play.
As is always the case, a play by local
talent brings a full house and "The
Private Secretary" was no exception.
Central hall turned out a ninety dollar
audience for the Juniors on Friday eve
ning last and everybody appeared well
pleased with the efforts of the class.
".The Private Secretary" is a comedy
drama full of life and spirit and fun
producing parts.
The characters as published recently,
took their roles extremely well. There
seemed to be no embarrassment or hes
itation, although all were new at the
task.
The play called for plenty of action,
and each actor entered into the spirit
of the plot and its unfolding with un
usual vim.
As a specialty between acts the male
quartette of Olin lieayis, Kawley Mail
man, Uoy Sweet and Clifford Hutton
sang two songs which were thoroughly
appreciated.
After the play many stayed for a
couple of hours dancing, with Hutton's
orchestra furnishing music.

mony was performed at the home of

The death of Mrs. Valentine Stocks
occurred on Saturday evening, April
29th, at the residence of her daughter,
Mrs. Wm. Woodard, where the deceas
ed had made her home since October
last.
Miss Jane Drown was born of EDg
lish parents in MoDtreal, Lower Canada
October 13, 1836, and came to Upper
Canada with her parents where she
resided until her marriage to Valentine
Stocks April 30, 1856, at Port Huron.
After residing in Port Huron and the
township of Hurchville a few years,
they moved to Elk township. Sanilac
county in 1867, where they made their
home on a farm, experiencing pioneer
life of those early days. To this union
twelve children were born, four dying
in infancy, and one daughter after
reaching womanhood. Two children
were also adopted, James a nephew,
and Guy a grandson.
Deceased is survived by her husband
and the following children: Valentine
jr., Los Angeles, Cal.; Mrs. Abner Sis
cho, Frank, John, James, Guy, Mrs.
Wrm. McLaue, Mrs. Wm. English and
Mrs. Wm. Woodard.
For many years Mrs. Stocks was a
?;reat sufferer from rheumatism, and
or the past three years was
practically helpless, but amidst it all
she maintained a cheerful, sunny dis-
Eosition, the christian's hope sustaining
er in her great affliction.
The funeral services were held on
Tuesday from the home of her daugh
ter, Mrs. Wm. Woodard. Public service
conducted by Elder C. B. Milberry, of
Lexington.
Mrs. Sara Lett, widow of the late
John Lett, died at the home of her
daughter, Mrs. Lyman Guilliat, in the
township of Greenwood on April 27th,
at the age or 72 years, after about one
month's illness.
Three children, Thomas, Jesse and
Mrs. Guilliat besides many friends are
left to mourn the loss of a kind and
affectionate mother and warm friend.
Funeral services were held at the
home on Sunday, April 30, Rey. Jones
conducting the services. Interment in
Lett cemetery.
We desire to extend our thauks to
all friends and neighbors who so kindly
assisted us during the illness and after
the death of our mother, Mrs. John
Lett. Signed, The Family.
Miss Sadie F. Imeson. sister of Mrs.
James Shaw, of Yale, died at the hos
pital in Port Huron on Thursday of
last week, after an operation on Tues
day from which she did not rally. Miss
Imeson was 24 years of age and for
eight years had lived in Port Huron.
She was a stenographer and cashier for
the Manufacturers Life Insurance
Company, a member of the Haptist
church, a singer in the choir and well
known in church, social and fraternal
circles. Her death is mourned by
many warm, personal friends. Mr.
and Mrs. JatneB Shaw and daughter,
Mrs. Lew Hradley attended the fun
eral services.
Windsor & Jardine Now.
Twenty-five years ago this month
Dick Windsor landed in Yale and pur
chased Will Salter's barber shop, then
located between the Central Drug
Store and John Hutton's hardware.
Later he bought the lot where the bar
ber shop building now stands and
built a neat brick shop and moved
into the same. He has attended strict
ly to business and has been ou the job
all the time looking after the welfare
of his trade, taking but very little va
cation in all these years. '
Relieving that it is not necessary to
be tied so closely to business he entered
idto partnership with Hert Jardine this
week and the Orni name is now Wind
sor & Jardine. The management of
the shop will be under the supervision
of Mr. Jardine. Hert has worked for
his present partner many years and is
well known and popular with every
body in this city and surrounding
country.
We bespeak for the new firm the
success that has favored the shop for
so many years, and continued good
service and treatment to all customers
either new or old.
