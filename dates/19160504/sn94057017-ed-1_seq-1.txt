There still lacks any announce
ment of a session of district court

J. J. Smith reports the strange
disappearance of a three-days-old
mule colt between Sunday
and Tuesday morning. He has
searched every foot of his pas
ture and the country immediate
ly adjacent, and has failed to

it had been killed by wolves
there would be some trace.
Charley Burruss is going to
put in a fiour and feed store, but
has not yet closed a deal for a
building. He has a car of fiour
now on the way. He will handle
flour and meal and all kinds of
feed, including hay, and will try
to keep a full stock on hand all
the time. He will also handle
grain and hides. He has been
negotiating with Barney Freilin
ger for the building he now oc
cupies, Barney to move his sa
loon into the new building across
the street, but this deal so far
has not been closed.
Here is another Ford story:
Last Friday Roland Harwell
drove his Ford into the lumber
yard and left it standing with
the motor running while he
stepped to the pump a few rods
distant to get some water. The
Ford misunderstood orders in
in some way, or else it was so
anxious to go that it just couldn't
endure to stand still. Anyway,
it started, and went for the lum
ber yard team of mules standing
near, giving Maud a bump in the
stomach which she didn!t ap
prove of, and she and her mate
performed some capers not down
in the rules of behavior for well
conducted mules. Meanwhile
Mr. Harwell had recovered from
his astonishment and with a few
prodigious strides grabbed a
Ford hind wheel and hung on for
dear life. Help arrived prompt
lv and both the Ford and the
mules were subdued before aeri
ous damage resulted.
Really, this is carrying the
joke a little too far. May Day
was signalized by a heavy fall of
snow, which was followed by a
slisrht freeze. Vegetation does
not appear to have been dam
azed. even the tender leaf buds
just opening showing no dam
age. There was a little rain on
Sunday evening, and during the
latter part of the night it began
snowing, continuing the greater
Dart of the day. Much of the
snow melted as it came in con
tact with the earth, but it
reached a considerable depth on
the eround nevertheless. At
Estancia it was recorded as one
and three-fourths inches, and the
nreciDitation .44 of an inch. The
snowfall in the Manzano moun
tains was much heavier at the
south end of the range than at
the north. Mail Carrier Wood
reDorts the depth of snow in the
foothills at eight to ten inches,
and at Eastview eighteen inches.

Charley Groff , a trusty at the
jail, took French leave some time
between Tuesday evening and
Wednesday morning, and has
not been seen or heard from
since. He was found sleeping in
deserted house near Duran,
and was bound over to the grand
jury on a charge of burglary.
This occurred some time in Feb
ruary, and probably Charley held
a trial all by himself and decided
that he had been incarcerated
long enough. His departure
was reported to the deputy sher
iff early Wednesday morning by
another trusty, Jose Perrez. Jose
was sent up from the same place
and had his trial at the last term
of court. He did not deny the
act charged against him, and
was sentenced to a five-year term
in the penitentiary, the court in
structing the clerk not to issue a
commitment until he could look
into the case further. The sher
iff's officers think Jose is entire
ly innocent of criminal intent, as
he has proven perfectly trust
worthy in every respect since he
has been in jail. His act was
the placing of a small rock on
the rail in front of a hand car, he
says as a practical joke on his
comrades who were pumping the
hand car. But it proved a costly
joke, throwing the hand car off
the track, breaking one man's
leg and skinning up some of the
others. Jose has learned his les
sonthat all practical jokes are
exceedingly stupid attempts at
humor, and carry within them
selves the possibilities of - results
far removed from jokes.
That determination and per
severance will overcome almost
any handicap is proven by C. M
Smith, who lives in che Pine
Grove neighborhood west of
Moriarty. La3t year Mr. Smith
did not have a silo, but he had a
patch of corn, a cistern, a hatch
et, -a strong arm and a stout
heart. The result was about
four and one-half tons (estimat
ed) of good silage. Mr. Smith
and his son put one and one-
third acres of corn into the cis
tern, cutting it into three-fourths
of an inch lengths with a hatch'
et, and treading it down well in
the cistern. The silage was fed
to five cows, lasting three
months. If the estimate of the
amount of silage is correct, this
would give a ration of twenty
Dounds vet day per animal. Un
fortunately we do not know
what, if any, additional teed was
given, cut during the time tne
silage was fed Mr. Smith's cream
check was $4.70 per week, and
when the silage gave out it im-1
mediately dropped to $3 50. Of
course, without the knowledge
of what tlse the cows were fed
during the time they were on the
silage and what the feed was
afterward, this item is of no par
ticular significance as a feeding
test; but the manner in which
Mr- Smith got his silage is of
particular significance. - The test
satisfied him of the value of
silage, for he is going to build a
silo this summer.
GET BOB'S
It has long been a matter of
common knowledge that Mr.
Robert P. Ervien, Commissioner
of Public Lands, is a man of un
usual versatility, but it is not so
generally known that he is an
adept in the culinary art if one
may judge from the evidence at
hand in the form of a most at
tractive booklet recently issued
by the State Land Office under
the title of ' 'New Mexico Cook
ery."
The cover design is a character'
istic scene of New Mexico, show
ing an adobe house adorned with
long strings of red chile drying
in the warm, autumn sunshine,
with stately Lombardy poplars
in the background.
In this booklet are to be found
many receipts that are published
for the first time, more especial
ly those that concern the prepar
ation of dishes in which chile
forms a principal ingredient. At
first glance it might appear that
a cook book is a rather round
about way in which to advertise
the resources of New Mexico,
but in an interview with a rep
resentative of this paper Mr.
Ervien stated that this special
cook-book has a mission in the
field of literature very similar to
that of the hymn books which
advertised a certain brand of
patent medicine. He said that
in a little country village, in the
effete East, once upon a time, as
the story runs, a struggling
church was most anxious to se
a supply of hymn books, but not
having the funds necessary to
purchase them, the minister of
the church was on the alert for a
generous donor of the books.
One day a traveling agent for a
patent medicine was in the vil
lage and hearing of the minis
ter's perplexity the agent called
upon him and offered to present
the church the desired number
of hymn books, providing the
minister would consent to hav
ing advertisements of the patent
medicine which the agent repre
sented printed in the books.
The minister was loth to accept
the books on those terms, for it
seemed almost a desecration to
him, but he certainly wanted
those hymn books, and after con
sulting with his trustees, he fi
nally concluded that it would be
excusable under the circum
stances to take the gift so oppor
tunely offered, and the agent
was so notified.
The day before Christmas the
hymn books arrived, and after a
hasty glance through the books
it was with feelings of joy and
gratitude that the minister failed
to detect any indications of an
advertisement, and came to the
conclusion that the agent had re
pented of the commercial char
acter of his gift, and in the gen
erosity of his better nature had
sent the books without the ob
jectionable advertisements.
Christmas morning found a
new nyrcn dook in every pew,
and with a beaming face the
minister arose and rquested the
congregation to sing "Hymn
Number 34." Imagine his con
sternation when these words
greeted his ear:
"Hark the herald angels sing,
Take Punk's pills for anything
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
Two for a man and one for a
child."
That's like Bob's cook book
Reading between the lines of
every receipt is the biggest kind
of an advertisement for New
Mexico, telling the story of a
wonderfully fertile land and giv
ing the manner of cooking the
products of the soil as ' 'Those to
the manor born have been ac
customed to prepare them for
generations, giving publicity to
a personal knowledge of this
special kind of cookery acquired
only after many years of patient
endeavor.
This little brochure on New
Mexico Cookery is a valuable
contribution to New Mexico
literature, and every housewife
in the state, as well as many of
those outside its boundaries, will
want a copy of this unique book
let, and if it accomplishes its
mission of bringing to the atten
tion of its readers a better under
standing of the use of the special
products of the soil of New
Mexico, as well as an apprecia
tion of the fertility of this land,
this booklet will have served a
most excellent purpose. Mr. Er
vien states that this booklet is
for free distribution, and if any
one deíiring it sent either to her
self or her friends will kindly
send names and addresses to the
State Land Office, with request
for the booklet on New Mexico
Cookery, it will be mailed direct
ly as desired.
