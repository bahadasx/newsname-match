of the Kentucky Press Association, will
hand out the Nicholasville mail the

time and money for candidates than
the newspaper man and we are truly
glad when one is handed a piece of pie.
We congratulate Nicholasville on hav
ing so good a postmaster.
ENFORCE VAGRANT LAW.
Why not enforce the vagrant law in
Lancaster? Some door-steps on Rich
mond street hold from ten to twelve
idle vagrants from morning until night.
Of course they get hungry, of course
they need money, then of course they
plan to get It dishonestly which costs
the town something, besides nothing
looks so bad as a lot of idle shiftless
negroes loafing around town. There is
plenty of work for aU to have employ
ment and they should get to work or
get out.

TELEPHONE COM
PANY LOSES
SUIT.
HOST FURNISH SERVICE AT
THE OLD RATE.
The telephone controversey which haa
been disturbing the people of Lancas
ter for some time has been temporarily
settled. The Bastin Telephone Com
pany some weeks ago notified the sub
scribers that it would raise the fates
in the city of Lancaster from one dol
lar per month for phone service to $1.60
for residence and $2.00 for business
phones. At the mass meeting recently
held by the citizens of the community
and subscribers it was decided to resist
the collection of the proposed raise and
the Bastin Telephone Company had de
clined to eive service to those who' ra.
fuJed payment, causing a good deal of
annoyance. At a later mass meetincit
waa decided to bring an Injunction suit
against the telephone company to com
pel it to give service to the people who
offered to pay the old rate of one dol
lar. At this mass meeting Messrs G.
B. Swinebroad, H. C. Kauffman, G. C.
Walker and J. K. Robinson tendered to
the people of the community their ser
vices in handling this litigation free of
any fee. About fifty citizens signed a
paper authorizing the use if their
names as plaintilTs In this injunction
suit. Suit was promptly filed after the
mass meeting last week and notice was
given to the Telephone Company that
application for an injunction would be
made before Judge Hardin in Harrods
burg, on Monday, to compel the Com
pany to reconnect those subscribers
who had been denied service and to re
strain the Company from further dib-
connecting the patrons. Upon the
hearing of the case, which was argued
by J. E. Robinson, G. 11. Swinebroad
and II. C. Kauffman for the people and
L. L. Walker for the Telephone Com
pany. Judge Hardin decided that the
Telephone Company had no franchise
by which it had a right to maintain its
business in the town, but was upon the
streets by a voidable contract, which
licensed it to conduct its business In
the town, but which contract could be
terminated at any time by either party
by giving reasonable notice to the othet
but as long as The Bastin Telephone
Company occupied the streets it would
be required to give service at the rate
of one dollar per month to all sub
scribers who desired the service, and
Ly judgement directed The Telephone
Company to reconnect the subscribers
to whom service had been refused and
ordered the Company not to disconnect
any other subscribers on account of the
refusal to pay the advance rate.
The plaintiffs in the cuse were G. M.
Lyons, Dave Sanders, J. R. Mount, J,
F. Holtzclaw and J. W. Smith, suing
for themselves and other citizens of
tho town. Hand was required of the
plaintilTs in the sum of one thousand
dollars, which will be executed by about
fifty citizens of the community. The
case will likely be taken to the Court
of Appeals by the Telephone Company.
This is considered as a great legal
victory by those who do not feel that
the proposed raise in rates are justified
under the circumstances, and further
that the Telephone Company must
either cease to do business in the city,
or contract with the citizens and Coun
cil for a telephone franchise upon a
basis which will be reasonable to the
people as well as to the Telephone Com
pany. The Council can not satisfactorily
dispose of the telephone franchise while
the Telephone Company is upon the
streets doing business under the con
tention that it is here as a matter of
tight, for by so doing result in two
telephone systems which the people do
not desire. It seems now that the tele
phone question must be settled in the
Courts and the winning of this ault Is
construed as giving the peoplt a decided
advantage over the Telephone Co.

BAD KILLING NEAR
BRYANTSVILLE.
Aaron Rolar, colored, fired two shots
from a pistol into the stomach of Curt
Ambrose, colored, last Saturday night
at White Oak, a negro settlement near
Uryantsville, on the Buena Vista road,
from the effects of which he died about
twelve hours later, his intestines hav
ing been perforated thirteen times.
Bolar at once made a get-a-way and has
not as yet been apprehended. From
reports gathered from some of the wit
nesses, the killing was unprovoked and
cold blooded. It seems that Bolar had
just returned from Lexington with a
lot of whiskey and stopped at the house
of Reynold Meyers, where Ambrose
was also stopping. The latter asked
Bolar for a drink of whiskey, which
seemed to anger him and he replied
that he had no whiskey and immediate
ly snatched a pistol from his hip pocket
and fired two shots with the above re
sults. Money Is being raised to offer a
reward for the arrest of Bolar and he
will probably be apprehended in a lew
days.
GRANT'S GRANDSON READY.

CAUGHT WITH THE GOODS.
Fred Emerson, better known among
the colored people, as "Potsy", and
Taylor Simpson, familiarly dubbed as
"Snip" were caught with six gallons of
booze in their possession last Monday
nifht, by Marshall Ruck, as they were
returning from Hyattaville, where they
had gone to the express office and sign
ed for it. They were immediately tak
en before Judge Frisbie, nnd being un
able to give ball were remanded to jail
to await their trial this morning. They
were charged with having this whiskey
in their possession for the purpose of
sale. The whiskey was in two cases.
each containing twenty-four pints and
Judge Frisbie ordered Marshal Back to
take charge of it until the trial.
Much interest is being shown as to
what disposition will be made of the
booze should "Potsy" and "Snip" be
iounu guilty as cnargea.
IN FOR FORGERY.
James Nevieus, Robert Kennedy.
Henry Wearren and George Jennings,
all colored boys with warrants agains(
them for forgery, are either in jail or
have a place awaiting them there.
Robert Kennedy and George Jennings
are in jail, while James and Henry de
cided to "beat it" to some other sea
port. Robert tells that James asked
him if he didn't want to make tome
money and told him he Would write a
check for $8.00 on Mr. William Simpson
which he could get cashed Mid pay him
some of it. James tells that Robert
asked him to write the check saying
Mr. Simpson owed him and he didn't
know ft was wrong. The long and
short of It is, James wrote the check
which Mr. Will West cashed after
taking out $2.50 for a pair of shoes,
Robert claims the other three boys
then held him up and took the money
away from him which they divided be
tween themselvea giving him none.
As soon as Mr. West found out the
check was cold he hunted up Robert
getting the shoes which leaves him
languishing In jail without either shoe
or money, a sadder but wiser boy.
This little atory has a moral which Is,
"the idle boys brain 1 the devil'
workshop." If these boys who loaf on
doorsteps and side walk were forced
to work, by the vagrant law being en
forced there would not be io much mis
chief planned. Ten or twelve Idle boy
can alway bo seen on the same door
step where this forgery was thought
of and carried out
