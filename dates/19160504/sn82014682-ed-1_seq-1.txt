wiilan Susar Planters Association,
after extended deliberation and care-
I ful consideration cf the various class

crease can best he effected through
enlarges and extending- the scope of
the existing Elding scale bonus, which
Is based urea the price of raw sugar,

71-13 t:.tezs!cn cf the bonus system
tj 1.3 the fcllawlzg lines: -
The ic.':Ur3 cf the bomn t.rbe
Increased 50 rcr cent, The bonus sys
tem to be extended so that all labor
ers ca the plantations contractor of
all kinds, as well as day men-chsU
particirate therein. Also that a sub
stantial proportion of the bonus be
paid monthly End the balance, if any,
paid at the end cf the bonus year. , v
' "Another Important change is that
the provision that the tcnus shall be
raid only to these who reir.ain a whole
year upon the plantation and average
210 days work for the year will be
done away with. Any laborer who is
working on the plantation at the end
of the bonus year shall receive his
bonus for each and every month of the
previous year during which he .has
worked 20 days. ; ,.
The condition requiring 20 days
labor per month to entitle any laborer
to a bonus is retained with the same
provision that If he is sicjt or' disabled
cr excused by the manager, he shall
be entitled to the proportion of bonus
for the days he has worked. "s ' -
"It is deemed necessary to retain
this feature of the bonus system In
order to discourage loafing and en
courage efficiency. Under this pro
vision a man. Is required to work only
75 per cent of his time; and if it were
not retained many men would work
less days than they do at present.
"The changes and modifications are
es follows:
Bonus Percentage Increased. ;
"The present rate of bonus is to be
increased SO per cent and . will be
calculated on the following scale: If
the New York price for sugar averages
$71 per ton the, bonus . will be V
per cent of the earnings or Wages as
the case may be and for every dollar
Increase over 171 dollars the bonus
will be : increased 1H per cent; so
that with sugar averaging $80 per ton
the bonus will be 15 per cent Instead
of 10 per cent as at present; $90 per
ton, 30 per cent; $100 per ton, 45 per
cent; $110 per ton, 60 per cent, and
so on in like proportion..
Laborers Entitled to Bonus.
"Day wage laborers receiving $ 2 4
per month and under, and all short
term contractors, such .as cutters,
loaders, etc., who work not less than
20 days per month, will be entitled to
a bonus based on their earnings. To
such men 20 per cent of their month
ly earnings will be paid monthly on
account of the annual bonus due Oc
tober 31, and the balance of the bonus
will be paid , at the end of the bonus
period. : ' - i-
"For example A laborer (whether
day man or short term contractor)
who has performed 20 days work dur
ing a given mdnth and who has earn
ed, say $20,; will be paid an advance
"" 20 per cent on account of his an
nual bonus, or $4, so that he will re
ceive for the month $21. Should the
average price of sugar, call for a 40
per cent bonus he would be paid on
October 31, an additional 20 per cent
: "In regard to cultivation contract
ors, it being impossible to determine
what their earnings will be until their
contracts are completed, they will be
paid a bonus, on the basis of wages at
the Tate of $24 per month, provided
they work. not leBS than 20 days per
month; and likewise a 20 per cent ad
vance of these assumed earnings will
