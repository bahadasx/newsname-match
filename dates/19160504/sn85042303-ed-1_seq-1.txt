METHODISTS
STORMED THE
TABERNACLE
AN INSPIRING SIGHT AS SEVEN
HUNDRED METHODISTS ENTER
ED, SINGING "THE OLD TIME RE
LIGION." The Methodists tried to take Ard
niore. More than seven hundred strong
they marched into the tabernacle last
night, for it was Methodist night. The
Sunday School in all its departments
with banners and music headed the
line-up and took the tabernacle by
storm.
It was an inspiring sight and they
were roundly applauded as they came
singing "The Old Time Religion."
The male quartette sang a beautiful
hymn and Mr. Pray gave us a solo of
great power and tenderness. The choir
and congregation were enthusiastic in
song.
Tonight the Woodmen of the World
will bring their delegation.
The Sermon.
The sermon last night was from the
same text as t ho night before, Heb.
2:3 "How shall we escape if we neglect
so great salvation."
On Tuesday night the idea carried
out by Dr. Williams was the saving
of a soul from future torment. Last
night the other side was presented
the beauties of Christian life, and the
reasonableness and reality of conver
sion. The speaker said in part There
is something worse than hell. It is
a soul so mean and devilish, so wick
ed and degraded that hell is the only
place where it could abide. And there
is something better than heaven. It
is to he so fine and pure, so nibble and
Christlike as to he unwelcome in hell.
The odor of a rose is in its nature
and the beauty of Christ is in his na
ture. The beauty and charm of Chris
tianity is not in a hypocrite. Yet the
hypocrite who pretends to be Christian
attests the beauty of Christianity.
Christianity must be fine and noble or
the hypocrite would not imitate it.
Hell is a necessity to the Justice of
God. Some people are prosperous and
fare sumptuously every day and have
apparently no trouble here yet they
leave a trail of sin, degradation and
wickedness that is appalling. Surely
they will reap their reward somewhere
If not here, then over there. Again
there are saintly lives, pure, clean and
noble, yet poverty, sickness and f-or-row
seem to beset their patiis, sure
ly a just God will give them a just re
compense and reward. To do so re
quires a heaven of happiness.
The New Birth.
Why should it be considered a mys
tery greater than things of nature?
The soil of the mineral kingdom pro
duces the grass of the vegetable king
dom which is eaten 'by the cow of the
animal kingdom; the cow In turn fur
nishes food for man, and man prays
to the God who is a spirit. From earth
to prayer is a long step but God has
created us to bridge this chasm.
The speaker stated that all changes
are not from above. This he illustrat
ed by the case of a prominent man in
a tovn of Kansas who was influential
in keeping Joints In this city. But
when his own son was found besot-

BUT FROM RELIABLE REPORTS
IT IS EVIDENT THAT GAS COM
PANY IS DOING ITS BEST TO
RELIEVE SITUATION.
The complaints against the gas
company are numerous and prolonged
over the low pressure at this time
of the year, and there is much spec
ulation as to what would happen if
the weather were real cold, but the
gas company is doing everything in
its power to relieve the situation, and
before autumn will have gas enough
in this city to supply twice what
they ever have served. The gas is
in the field. The gas company has
made arrangements to get the gas
from the Fox well, said by experts
to he the biggest flow and the high
est pressure that ever came out of
the ground. The company is anxious
to connect this line, but it is up
against a proposition which they can
not control, and the people will have
to be patient until the company can
overcome this. The company had its
order in for pipe for a long tim,
but the steel mills are not filling
them for the reason that the Euro
pean war is taking up their time Hi
present in filling orders at inflated
prices for war munitions and domes-
i tic orders will have to wait until
I lull in the fighting takes place,
i However, the gas company feL

MICK, THE
MASTER TOI
BUILDER RERE
FORMER MAYOR OF THIS CITY
NOW WARDEN OF THE STATE
PENITENTIARY IS IN THE CITY
TODAY ON BUSINESS.
R. W. Dick, warden of the state
penitentiary at McAlester, and former
mayor of this city was in Ardmore
today on private business, and min
gling with old friends. He was here
with Governor Haskell and was In
conference with I. N. Putnam who Is
interested in the Ardmore traction
company and who will rehabilitate the
line.
Mr. Dick, although a resident of Mc
Alester, has a warm spot In his heart
for Ardmore. He is practically the
father of every improvement the city
enjoys today and through his untiring
efforts lie raised the city out of the
mud and gave as his last effort a sys
tem of paved streets that are se.'ond
to none In the state.
Several of ills friends last night
urged him to give up his present po
sition and move back to Ardmore,
take charge of affairs and make the
old city hum with 'business life.
i.Mr. Dick after listening to the en
treaties of ills friends staled that if
the people of Ardmore would adopt the
managerial form of city government
ami give him a salary of five thousand
dollars a year for three years he
would return here, and if he did not
double the population of Ardmore in
that time, he would refund his salary
to the city.
Mr. Dick stated that he had many
plans that could be put into execution
for the betterment of the city at this
time, and not the least of these was
a municipal water power plant on the
Washita river that has been under dis
cussion for a number of years.
In speaking of the managerial form
of city government this morning, ex
niayor Dick stated that it was a form
of city government that was bound to
come in the very near future. "You
know that I am a partisan and always
have been when it came to politics,
but the time lias at last arrived when
partisan politics should not enter in
to the management of city affairs. The
whole people, regardless of politics
are a unit in wanting the affairs of
the city administered in a business
like economical manner, and this it
seems is mighty near impossible
where partisan politics enter the con
sideration." A majority of the citizens
'of Ardmore would like to see Rob
i Dick return here, there are opportuni
ties that his master mind can grasp
and there is little doubt but what lie
would make pood upon his proposition
to double the population of the city
f within the three years if he were giv
en the opportunity of doing so. At
any rate, when the time comes, if it
ever does when the state no longer
requires his services as warden of the
state penitentiary, and that seems re
mote, as he has established a nation
al reputation as a humane, sensible
administrative officer in that difficult
position, he can return to Ardmore,
and so long as he lives there will be
a good job open to him.
