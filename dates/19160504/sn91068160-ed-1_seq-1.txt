- h F Stewart and Mrs, M. R Ran
0i ou Fleming street Tuesday after
loon about 6:30. The flames origina
ted in the home of Mr Stewart and the
sidence was doomed before the fire
department arrived. When the de
partment arrived an effort was made
secure a sufficient stream with a
-hree inch hose attached to . a hydrant
1 1 two inch water main. The result
tht a stream was secured, that
JSd hardlv reach the top of the one
!?orv house. The loss was in the
ii-hboorhood of $4,000.
The firemen did good work consider
ing tre difficulty under which they
xrere laboring. Another line of hose'
later connected with the main
water line about 3 blocks away. This
v-s secured after the two houses were
flocmed. A number of garden hose
streams wer nut into use by the
neighboring residents, when it looked
as If the entire block would he con
sumed. Had it not been for a metal roof on
the next house to the second house
burned, it too would have burned to
the eround before the second hose
Lad been brought into use.
CnfWerable comment was heard af
ter the tire of the inadequate fire pro
tection in this, one of themost thickly
settled residential sections of Hender
sonville. Several members of the city com
missioners and the mayor were on the
srrD'Jnd during the fire and it is more
San likely that the matter of a larger
Mter main and more hydrants for
Carolina Heights and vicinity - will be
acted favorably upon soon.

About $10,000 will be spent on 're
modeling the old city hall which has
stood under suspicion of being" unsafe
for many years. The present ,city
officials began work on the prelimi
nary steps towards remodeling the
building many months ago. Quite a
lot of discussion was indulged in by
leading citizens as to whether the, city
should remodel or build a new city
hall.
To build a new city hall would have
cost a great deal more than the pres
ent plans which the officials think will
give Hendersonville an adequate ad
ministration building and opefa house
for years to come.

it was remarkable the way new rail

as long as they intend to wait for out
side capital to come to them and de
velop their resources. They are right
now building railroads from Toptonto
Robbinsville. N. C, over some of the
wildest mountain country. A stand

from Andrew to Haysville, N.VC.
which is also going to open up a vast
mountain region, AH these roads are
being built from the sale of township
