BE A MAN.
. (J. F. Garvey, Cropper, Ky., in the Courier Journal)
Whatever your calling, whatever your Creed,
Be you ever so rich or sorely in need,
This one admonition may you ever heed,
Be a man.
Tho' of t you are tempted, tho' falter you, may,
And stumble and fall short of duty each day,
Let this thought be with you forever to stay,
Be a man.
At home with the loved ones, the babes at your knee,
With neighbor o stranger on dry land or sea,
At business, at pleasure, whereever you be,
Be a man.
'Tis this vou are fashioned in God's Image for,
Aught else in your life this same God must abhor,
Do you know you must needs be an animal or---Be
a man. t .
Are you stricken with poverty, sickness or grief,
Till you reel toward the precipice of unbelief, .
If you are here in pointing the way of relief
Be a man. ' ,k
Be a man for the sake of the God of all grace,
Be a man that you may look the world in the face,
Be a man that you may boast of winning your race
Be a man.
