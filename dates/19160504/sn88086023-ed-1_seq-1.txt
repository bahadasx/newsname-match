will be made until I'arranxa approves.
The president and Baker conferred
at noon. Afterwards a message was
sent to Scott itatlng that the presi
dent awaited word from Carrania
which was expected late today. The
president then probably will issue a
statement.
Aside from the knowledge that the
agreement does not put a time limit
upon the slay of troops in Mexico and
provides a satisfactory use of the rail
ways, nothing official has been
learned.

Natatorium Will
be Opened June 1
is Announcement
IN ALL PHOBABU4TY A STEAM
HEATING PLANT WI1J. BE
INSTALLED.
The natatorium at Round-Up Park
will be opened on June l and a steam
heating plant will, In all probability,
be Installed.
These two announcements, of para
mount Interest loca.ly, were made at
the council meeting last evening by
Chairman Taylor of the natatorium
committee. The committee, he said,
Is now actively at work In preparing
for the bathing season and hopes to
make the Institution even more popu
lar then last year.
The announcement that the water
will probably be heated Is particularly
gratifying to lovers of aquatic sport,
inasmuch as the overflow water from
the city resorvoirs Is too cold for com
fortable bathing In the early and late
seasons.
If the heating plant is put In, a suf
ficient charge for bathing will be
made to pay the cow of maintenance
The committee believes that only a
small charge will be necessary.
For some time It was considered
that an electric heating plant could
be Installed but the committee now
believes that a steam plant would be
more satisfactory and Just as eco
nomical The plan Is to Install colls
In a concrete Intake basrn so that the
water. In entering the pool, will pass
over the hot pipes. The temperature
of the water can be raised 'rom ten to
forty degrees by this method, the
committee thinks.
At present the plan hinges upon se
curing a boiler that will not he too
expensive.

To sprinkle streets.
rhulrman Phelps of the street

Issue Strain Saus the
Will be Heavy or fcpayer
NOTE The following Is the ad
, drees delivered Tuesday at Pilot Roc
by Assessor C. P. Strain In opposition
I to the bond issue for good roads:
When It comes to selling bonds by
I the million to invest In roads, pru
! dence cbunsels rareful consideration
1. What will be the total cost?
2 Will It pay?
5. Will home lalor receive maxi
mum benef.ta under jropu d plan?
4. Who pays the taxes?
6. Are there other needs mors
pressing?
6 How long will the road last?
.Multnomah is held to have made a
generous contribution toward perma
nent good roads through construction
of one hundred miles of the Columbia
highway. She has more than eight
times our taxable property, and more
than eleven times our population. She
had scenery of unsurpassed beauty,
and grandeur to be made accessible
by this road. She is the metropolis
of the state, having an empire above
her, and th world's markets open to
her through the lower river and the
Pacific ocean. Portland's position
entitles her to be, and destiny decrees
that she must be the premier city of
the Pacific Northwest. Her road does
several things. It traverses a thickly
setted section of dairy farms, gardens
and orchards, bringing the products
of these into such close proximity to
the table of the city dweller, that de
lightful freshness Is assured. It
brings a wonderful prayground, rich
in health and pleasure possibilities
within convenient reach, in point o
time and cost, to two hundred thou
sand people who need outdoor recrea
tion. It Is an investment which ought
to yield to the state and nation by
reason of its placing a great wealth
of scenic wonders upon a public
highway for the enjoyment of all.
Upon this score, no section of our
proposed road compares with that ot
Multnomah's.
No entrancing mountain scenery,
no invigorating health resort or play
ground, no tourist harvest is claimed.
The east end and west end of the
eountv alone are thickly settled and
devoted to diversified crops. The
Pendleton market consumes but a
mere fraction of their produce. The
Columbia river and rail transporta
tion constitute our market roads. As
suming, however, the hard surfaced
roads to be of the same value to us
that Multnomah's roads are to her
people, and that we spend as much
in proportion to our means as she has
spent, then it is up to us to construct
twelve miles of hard surfaced roads
I reach Troops Hushed Through streets in
vpovjtu

But more Chs nundred miles are
demanded, and . .is would entail up
on us a hardship equal to that upon
them by the construction of a thou
sand miles.
Having leas urgent need, can we
afford to spend money upon our roads
eight times more lavishly than Mult
nomah County has done? Those be

of the cost have a surprise awaiting
them. Columbia county sold $260,
000 worth of bonds ana made a direct
road levy of f 100,000 more. The great
sum went in chunks where nothing
was received in return The state
ment was made, without contradiction
at the State Taxpayers' League Con
vention in Portland, that 1108,000 of
it was swallowed up by the state en
gineering department The upshot ol
tbe whole affair Is that the money has
been consumed and that the road Ilea
unfinished. The bond limit has been
reached, the road Is going to ruin for

BERLIN, May 4. It was officially
announced that the German reply

WASHINGTON. May 4 The Ger

summary of the German attitude.
WASHINGTON, May 4 The un
certainty of when Germany's reply
will be dispatched raised new doubts
today of the document's contents.
Either a direct compliance with Am

pected. The time being taken for
framing a reply aroused the belief
that a temporizing mesaage was like

frame a reply directly complying with
the demands without arousing feeling
in Germany, explains the delay. Ger
