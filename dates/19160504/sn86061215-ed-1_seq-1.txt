VOLUME SIXTY-EIGHT
OF WILSON Ofl
BREAK IS DUE
If Note Now Being Drawn Is
Not Satisfactory, There
Will Be No Argument
LONG CONTROVERSY
NOT CONTEMPLATED
Negotiations to Follow in
Case Kaiser First Ends
Present Practices
Washington, D. C., May 3.—The an
nouncement from Berlin that new and
definite instructions are to be given
to German submarine commanders Is
the first positive indication of how
Germany will attempt to meet Presi
dent Wilson's final demand that she
abandon the present methods of sub
marine warfare.
Whether the new instructions will
meet the terms of the last American
note and thus prevent a break in diplo
matlc relations can only be determined
by a close and careful examination.
President Wilson Is represented by
those closest about him as unshaken in
his determination that the Issue is not
negotiable that a settlement can not
be delayed by discussion of side is
sues that the controversy between
the countries can proceed further in
diplomacy only if Germany effectually
•tops destruction of ships without
warning and takes measures to bring
her submarine operations otherwise
within the confines of International
law.
With the evidence that such orders
will be carried .out In good faith, the
president is willing, to discuss the con
duct of. submarine warfare, but only
'upon that bails. There is no relaxing
of the determination that the issue can
-not be delayed further.
Until this morning Germany's de
lay In making reply and the absence
of any definite report from Ambassar
dor Gerard have led American officials
to fear that the Berlin foreign office
was planning to send an answer which
the United States could not consider
satisfactory.
The news that new interactions to
submarine commanders would be an
nounced served to encourage hope of a
favorable outcome of the long dispute.
The state department was still with
out any report from Ambassador
Gerard today and has received none
since Friday. It was stated that in
view of the developments In Germany,
Including Emperor William's partici*
patlon in framing the reply and the
American ambassador's visit to head
Quarters, the length of time taken by
the Berlin foreign office to answer the
American note Is not considered un
reasonable but it was made clear that
unless such important developments
had Intervened to make for delay, it
would not have been considered that
the American demand for Immediate
action had been met.
NOTE 18 REAOY.
Berlin, May 3.—(By wireless to The
Associated Press via Sayville)—The
draft of the German reply to the
American note has been finished. The
reply is subject to minor alterations
which may result from interchanges of
views between Berlin and general
-A.«v,\ headquarters.
,,jY The attitude of Germany will be
stated in clear and precise terms. The
.-.j note will leave no room for doubt con
-\tP corning the exact position assumed by
Germany, which will communicate the
definite nature of instructions that
will be given to submarine command
ers and other data on which Washing
ton Itself can judge the situation.
The Associated Press is permitted
to make these statements, although
the censorship on dispatches tending
to reveal the tenor of the German
reply is still effective. The date of
delivery of the answer has not been
fixed.
GERARD IN BERLIN AGAIN.
Berlin, May 3.—Ambassador James
W. Gerard, after his arrival at the
'American embassy on his return from
headquarters, received the newspaper
correspondents and held a short con
versation with them on various topics

bassador declined to make the slight
est reference to the occasion of his
visit to the emperor, explaining that
the situation Imposed absolute silence
upon him. It was learned, however,
that he received Secretary Lansing's
telegram of instruction in time to com
municate with Chancellor von Beth

Leaders of Mexican and U. S.
Armies Reported to Have
an Understanding
NATURE IS BEING
KEPT CLOSE SECRET
Terms Sent to Carranza and
to Washington to Get
Official Approval
El Paso, Tex., May 3.—The ten
tative agreement said to have been
reached between Maj. Gen. Hugh
L. 8cott, chief of staff of the U. S.
army, and Gen. Alvaro Obregon,
minister of war In the de facto
Mexican cabinet, was generally
understood today te provide for a
gradual retirement of the Ameri
can forces In Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., May 8.—Advices from
Mexico City and Washington are
awaited today to set the seal of ap
proval upon a provisional agreement
that Is understood to have been
readied at the Informal conference be
tween Gen. Alvaro Obregon, minister
of war of the defacto government, and
Maj. Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff
of the U. S. army.
The conference was not ended until
after midnight and the two conferees
emerged from the meeting place in
rare good humor. Gen. .Scott went
immediately to his- private car and
arranged for the dispatch of a coded
message to Washington giving details
of the understandings that had btfen
effected.
This report is not expected to reach
the secretary of war until late today
and its consideration probably will de
lay the answer to Gen. Scott until
Thursday. A similar report is being
sent First Chief Carranza. It Is
thought the reply of the de facto gov
ernment will not reach here until after
Washington answers.
Neither Gen. Scott nor Gen. Obregon
would talk of the deliberations in
fact they agree to maintain strict si
lence pending the next step in the ne
gotiations. It has been suggested that
another formal conference here may
now be regarded as unnecessary and
that Mexico City and Washington will
say the final word in the settlement of
the military questions that have arisen
out of the drive of the American
troops into Mexican territory.

MISSISSIPPI RIVER
II RICHEST STAGE
IN A 6ENERRTI0N
PROTECTION WORK DONE AT
DAVENPORT 18 HAVING EX
CELLENT RE8ULT8.
Davenport, May 3. —Although the
Mississippi river is higher at Daven
port today than it has been for twenty
five years, the danger is not so great
in the city, owing to the ample warn
ing and the filling in which has been
done in the levee since the last high
stage. The new levee walls have kept
the water back from much of the
property in the heart of the city. The
stage is 16.1 feet today.
Lowlands along the Illinois and Iowa
ahores of the river are flooded, how
ever, and much property damage has
been done. Residents have been re
moving property all week, and are
continuing to do so. The stage will
be afoot higher here Saturday.
The river will come to a stationary
stage at Clinton Friday at Leclalre Sat
urday, at Davenport Saturday night
and at Muscatine Sunday.
TRACKS FLOODED.
Clinton, May 3. —Beaver island, a
portion of the city of Clinton separat
ed from the mainland by a slough and
Inhabited by a number of families, now
Is partially Inundated by the flood
waters of the Mississippi river. Homes
on the island, however, are on piling
foundations and are high enough to
escape damage, unless the water
should rise three more feet. The
stage of water this morning was 17.6
feet above low water mark, a rise of
five-tenths of a foot in the preceding
twenty-four hours. A rise of three
more inches, it was said, will necessi
tate the suspension of steam railroad
service between Clinton and Daven
port, the water now covering the ties
and, in Bome places the rails. The
roadbed of an interurban line operat
ing between Clinton and Muscatine via
Davenport, however, is sufficiently high
to escape the water.
RISING AT QUINCY.
Quincy, 111., May 3.—A maximum
stage of at least seventeen feet, per
haps more, Is predicted here before
the rising stage of the Mississippi
river is at its crest. The stage today
at 7 a. m„ was 16.4 feet above low
water mark, with indications of arise
of at least three-tenths of a foot be
fore night. The flood stage here is
fourteen feet.
The present stage Is doing as much
harm to farmers and levee workers in
the lowlands as an eighteen foot stage
could do. Water is rushing throuph
uncompleted gaps in all levees. Days
ago the Inhabitants moved all their
portable property and cattle to higher
land. Railroad traffic will not be men
aced nor will any serious new damage
result unless the water passes the
mark of eighteen feet.
MU8CATINE THREATENED
Muscatine, May 3.—With the waters
of the Mississippi four feet above the
level of the main streets in South
Muscatine, the lower section of this
city is threatened with complete in
undation. Railroad and street railway
tracks are already under water, while
several button factories are flooded
to a depth of five feet. Schools were
closed in that section of the city this
morning and street car service has
been discontinued.
Several hundred men are at work
bringing the leves up to the required
height. Muscatine, one of the chief
garden spot of Iowa is in grave peril
although scores of men are working
on every mile of the island levee.
CHILDREN FORTUNE
Little Mexican Youngsters Discover
Half Million In Paper Currency
Hidden in Building.
Mexico City, May 3.—The sum of
$500,000 in $100 bills recently was
found by two children, Rafael and
Antogenes Campos, inmates of the
government refuge, which occupies a
building formerly used as a legisla
tive palace. The money was discov
ered in an old boiler beneath the
palace. The children gave it to the
director of the home who gave them
$100 as a reward.
Secret service agents are trying to
find out where the money came from
and who hid it. The disposition of
the fortune has not been determined.

Wesleyan College Has Not

Raise Endowment
WILL CONTINUE
WORK UNTIL JUNE 22
Bad Weather of Final Day
Responsible for Failure
to Close Last Sunday
Iowa Wesleyan's campaign to add
half a million dollars to its endow
ment is not over. It is simply con
tinued until June 22. Between now
and June 4 the workers will devote all
of their time to the raising of Henry
county's additional $50,000.
Committees and squads for that
work are being organised at ML Pleas
ant today under the direction of Her
bert Jeffrey, publicity manager, and
Dr. W. M. Dudley, vice president of
Simpson college.
On June 4 work will be resumed on
the raising of $116,000 needed on the
$350,000 which the Iowa conference
was to furnish. None of the districts
have made up their full apportion
ment yet. Muscatine has the most,
Ottumwa second, Oskaloosa third and
Burlington last. The amounts appor
tioned and raised.follow:
Apport.
Muscatine $100,000

$76,000
64,000

The reason that the full amount was
not reached by May 1 is said by the
authorities to be because of the bad
weather on the last Sunday of the
campaign known as Gleaner day. This
always brings $75,000 or $100,000 on
such campaigns as this but owing to
the fact that it rained all day last Sun
day scarcely any work was done.

U. 3. TO BE MODEL.
Washington, D. C., May 8.—Secre
tary Baker, in announcing today that
negotiations would be undertaken with
workmen of the Rock Island, 111.,
arsenal, seeking a higher wage scale,
expressed his belief that the govern
ment should lead the way as an em
ployer and pay more than the usual
wage scale.
"The government," said, the secre
tary, "should be an Industrial leader
offering the employes better wages
and working conditions than private
employes. I believe the government
should pay a little the best wages and
offer a little the best working condi
tions. For two reasons it should pay
slightly over the usual wage scale—to
secure the pick of employes and be a
model to private employers'."
Mr. Baker said the labor department
had been asked to advise on the arse
nal wage scale and a final answer
probably will be given the workmen
May 15.
