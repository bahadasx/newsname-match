V:ir Has Increased Import
ance of the Interview, Says
Carlos F. Ilurd.
ACCURACY STRESSED
Milwaukee Editor and Iowa
Publisher Contribute to
Varied Program.
Tins was the day when city and
roiintrv newspaper men met in Switz
1( r Hall and exchanged ideas. The
session was that of the .Missouri Press
VssocMtioii. with J K. Pool, editor of
the Centralia Courier, presiding as
president Discussions and talks
tanged from those on press troubles
to svmposiums on editorial writing and
interviewing.
It is no longer necessary, if it was
ever necessary, to argue that the in
terview is news, said Carlos F. Hurd
of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch edi
torial staff, speaking on "The Art of
Interviewing" this afternoon. "The
war lias settled that question. Tiie
big news achievements of the war
have not been stories of declarations
of hostilities, of battles and ocean
disasters.
'The field of initiative has lain in
interviews with European personages.
Tli" tilings that these personages have
said, to American interviewers, have
in repeated cases been news, and have
made news."
No M't Formula for Interview.
That human personality is the
source of all news and that the inter
viewer is a seeker after personality,
which must express itself in ideas,
was the first thought in Mr. Hurd's
talk. If the interviewer is able to
present both personality and ideas in
worthy form, his product will be the
cream of the news columns and a
theme for the editorial columns.
Hut there is no formula for this art
of interviewing, which is a sport as
well, with its element of pursuit and
of uncertainty thinks .Mr. Hurd. The
factor of personalities and circum
stances is too big.
Though there are some details which
the interviewer should observe, such
as knowing something of the subject
in hand, if possible, and showing wis
dom in the use or non-use of the
pencil for interviews, ever thing
should be subordinated to accuracy.
"Accuracy," said Mr. Hurd, "not
onlj in giving the sense of a man's
remarks, but, if jou use quotation
marks, in giving his words."
Talks on Press Troubles.
The morning program opened with
a talk on "Presses and Press Trouble"
bj P J. Sole, pressman for the E.
W. Stephens Publishing Company of
Columbia.
Mr. Seley advised the country edi
tors, telling them the kind of presses
fj buj and giving suggestions on the
care and general operation of presses,
and the use of the appurtenances,
ciich as ink and the rollers.
"Since presses arc a life-time in
vestment," he said, "buj one that is
up to the minute. Hire a skilled
operator, who will save jou in repairs
what jou pay him extra m salary.
I pderstand the composition and the
u'e of the rollers and the printing
ii k, therebj saving jourself much
trouble and annovance from poor
printing."
Accuracy Insisted On,
That the most marked tendency of
the press In recent years is its steady
and rapid rise to freedom from the
ties of part ism was the opinion ex
pressed b Henry C. Campbell, editor
of the Milwaukee Journal. Mr.
Campbell's subject was ".Journalism
in the Present Day."
".Not verj long ago," he said, "one
of the veterans of the profession, one
of th countries striking and pictur
esque character, publicly stated that
if his political party nominated the
devil for president, his paper would
deem it a dutj to support his satanic
majost.v's candidacv. At that time the
remark excited little comment, very
little comment compared to the sharp
and general criticism that it would
evoke were it uttered today."
Another gratifjing evidence of the
upward trend of present-day journal
ism, according to Mr. Campbell, is the
insistence bj the heads of many edi
torial departments on the utmost de
gree of accuracy. Bureaus of ac
curacj have been established with
the double purose-f protecting the

Describes un Ideal Paper.
"The day has passed when the lo
cal newspaper is looked upon as a
charitable institution, meagerly and
begrudgingly supported as other town
charges are cared for," said E. E
Taj lor of Traer, la., editor of the
Traer Star-Clipper, speaking of "The
.Making of a Rural Newspaper." '"Xo
longer are subscriptions paid in cab
bage and cord wood, no longer are
displaj ads run for six mouths with
out change at starvation rates to
wipe out ancient bills of the editors
contracted in the village stores."
He pictured his ideal country news
paper as one that is a complete week-
lj history of the county in which it is
published, a paper with a reporter in
every town in the county and at least
two in everj township, with all the
doings of the court and county gov
ernment obtainable, with weekly real
estate transfers, marriage licenses, at
intervals lists of heavy taxpajers and
stockholders of banks and factories,
illustrations of prominent people and
notable doings and institutions, one to
three columns of state and neighbor
hood news, with letters from former
townspeople in other climes, vvitii an
editorial page giving opinions fear
lessly and fairly expressed, and, if
possible, in these later dajs, a wom
en's department edited bj a woman. It
should be made up with method, set
with modest heads, printed with the
best ink and should alvvajs be out on
time.
Editorial Deemed Important.
J. F. Hull, editor of the Marjville,
(Mo.) Tribune, made a short talk on
"Editorial Writing." A paper which
does not carry a vigorous editorial de
partment is falling far short of its
opportunitj, lie said. He declared
himself in favor of giving the editorial
front-page position in the small daily
papers.
Short talks were then made bj H

Man Te'lls Audience
How to Write.
Arthur Brisbane, editor of the New
York Evening Journal, whose salary is
in the neighborhood of $100,000 a year,
made the most of iiis time at the Uni
versity Auditorium last night. lie not
only delivered an address, as part of
the Journalism Week program, but in
doing so ho wrote (dictated) editorials
that will appear in the Hearst news
papers. Mr. Hrisbane, who spoke at the af
ternoon meeting in Switzler Hall also,
proce.ded to write, or rather talk, edi
torials on "Grace Hriggs, the Univer
sity prize cow" and on "What I would
say on the tombstone of John D.
Rockefeller." He prefaced his edi
torials with a few words on the re
quirements of an editorial.
Four things are required to write a
good editorial, according to Mr. Bris
bane. He said: "What jou write
must be seen; it must be read; it must
be understood; it must be believed."
Mr. Hrisbane drew from his "editorial
on Grace Hriggs the moral "votes for
women." He said that ho would put
on tiie tombstone of John D. Rockefel
ler, "Here lies the man who made men
realize that competition was unnec
essary and government ownership pos
sible."
Mr. Hrisbane, and his secretary left
on the 10:."0 train this morning for
Lawrence, Kan, where he will speak
to the students of the Kansas School
of Journalism.
f'KRISBANE ANSWERS 0.1'EsNONS
Enthusiasm a llig Asset in News Work,
He Sajs.
Arthur Brisbane, witli mud from the
state farm on his shoes and Grace
Hrigge on his mind, talked intimately
to newspaper men and "bojs and girls"
on the "How and Why of an Editorial"
esterday at Switzler Hall. After his
talk he answered questions asked by
students about newspaper work.
"The problem of an editorial is to get
an idea out of our head into the heads
of other human beings. The method of
accomplishment is of no consequence;
tiie thing to do is to do it," said Mr.
Brisbane. "Editorial writing is teach
ing wholesale. There are thousands
of ways of putting the same idea
across, but the most recently opened
path to the mind is the most difficult
and that is the path the editorial writ
er must take. Writing is the mere prob
lem of a trade; the ideas and thoughts
behind the writing are the real things."
In answering questions Mr. Brisbane
said that he would rather give a job to
a graduate of a college course in Jour
nalism than to one who had had five
ears' experience in reporting.
"The great danger of the newspaper
business is letting the jcars p'le up
The man who is fresh and enthusiastic
is the in in the newspapers want"
Mr. Hrisbane said that there was no
way to force inspiration for editorial
writing.
"Writing is merely the putting on
paper of thoughts that are in the
mind," he said. "There is nothing to
the old saying that 'What one does easi
est cannot be done well.' Worry about
the difficulty of having something to
write; not about writing it."
