LARIMER ACQUITTED
BY JURY IN CHICAGO
BANK FAILURE CASE
Former Illinois Senator Announces
That He Will Fay Debts of His
Institution.
VERDICT RETURNED AT ONE
A. M. THIS MORNING
Jury Deliberated Six and One-half
Hours Much Interest in the
Action.
Chicago, May 4. ^William Lorimer,
former senator, was acquitted this
morning by a jury at one o'clock on
charges as a result of bank failures
in Illinois. The jury deliberated six
and one-half hours.
To Fay Debts.
Lorimer announced today that he
would spend the remainder of his life
paying the debts of his bank.
Lorimer, together with Charles B.
Munday, his partner, and other offi
cials of the La Salle Street Trust and
Savings bank, was indicted following
the failure of the Lorimer-Munday
banks and institutions throughout Il
linois.
Munday was convicted and sen
tenced to five years in prison. He is
out on bail, pending an appeal*
Throughout his trial, which began
late in February, Lorimer had con
tended that he was innocent of ir
regularities in the affairs of the
banks in which he was an Officer, and
that he had left all of the details
of the management to Munday.
Furthermore, he contended that
sooner or later all who lost through
the failures would be paid in full.
Failure Not Necessary.
His principal defense was that the
failure of the banks was unnecessary,
and forced by a clique of opposing
bankers to accomplish Lorimer's
financial and political ruin.
Lorimer has had one of the most
dramatic careers in the records of
American politics. Born in 1861, in
Manchester, England, he came to Am
erica by steerage, was bootblack,
street car conductor, contractor, con
gressman and finally United States
senator.
.i-iTl- .^iL^
Elected to the senate in 19Q9 by
the Illinois legislature, Lorimer was
ousted in 1911, when charges wer^
made, that his election had beenl
bought:
Lorimer always dented this, declar
ing his political ruin had been
brought about by Chicago newspapers
allied with other interests against
him.
