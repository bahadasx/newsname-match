TAKES OWN LIFE .
TO PREVENT ARREST
Last week Thursday, Dewey
Carder, aged 19, took his own life
by means of a highpower Winches
ter rifle rather than be taken
prisoner on a charge of stealing
cattle. This tragic end came to
young Carder after he had evaded
the county officers for a number 6f
days. Deputy Sheriff, M. C
Smith, accompanied by special
deputies, J lm Kobertson ana
Wyatt Smith, were attempting to
make the arrest at the time that
the fatal shot was fired.
An effort was made by the
officers to arrest young Carder sev
eral flnvQ rrovinnq tn ttiA Hav nf
j r. . .
his death but at that time he could
not be found. On Thursday, word
was sent in by one of the ranchers
in Pitman Valley, that Dewey had
recently been seen in the McCoy
barn. Accompanied by his deput
ies,. Mr. Smith left tt once, by
auto, for the valley. Arriving at
the McCoy barn they learned
that young Carder had been in the
barn but a short time before altho
he was not there upon their arriv
al. They learned further, that he
had made the threat that he would
never be taken alive. He was
armed with a high power Win
chester rifle and a six sh joter.
Mr. Smith asked that some of
the neighbors go up to young Car
der who they felt sure was hidden
in the brush near-by and try to
persuade him to give himself up,
as the charge against him was not
a very serious one, and that would
be the easiest way out. None of
the neighbors would undertake this.
They feared that the boy would
shoot one of them just as quickly
as he would an officer.
. The officers' then started to look
in a clump of small trees, for the
boy.. .He was seen by one of them
at the barn, to run for a strip ot
larger trees farther away. Wyatt
Smith and Jim therewith cut across
and headed the boy off from reach
ing tne .iorest. m. j omitn tr.en
started for the same strip, of trees
from another side and young Car
der was seen to hide behind some
rocks and bushes. A single shot
was fired from the boy's hiding
place. Silence followed. Each
officer supposed that this shot had
been fired at one of the others.
The men closed in, keeping behind
cover. They then called to Dewey
asking him to come out and assur
ing him that he would receive no
injury. Getting ho reply, one of
the men fired a couple of shots
above the bushes. Still getting no
respohce, the-three men, expecting
every moment that , one of them
would be shot, rushed the 'bushes,
only to find the body of the boy.
The single shot had been his
death shot. With -the muzzle o"f
ma iiuc iuq( lvj uio ucaut lie iiau
met his end at -hi3 own hands.
Little was left of his head and the
place where the charge had enter
ed was powder burned. .
' The body was left as it was
found, until viewed by a coroner's
jury. . The cae was such a plain
one that no doubt could be enter
tained as to how he had met his
end.
The case is a sad one. Mr.
Chas. Carder, Sr., died but a short
time ago, leaving beside his wifr,
to mourn his death, four sons,
Harry, Chas. Jr., Robt. andCeArej-,
and three danghters, Mabel, Xona
and Mrs. Harry Wade. The pre
mature death of Dewey, doubles
the grief of the family.
