Watch Baxter Grow.
Keep your eyes on Baxter
Springs. Within twelve months
it is going to be the biggest and
best town in Cherokee county.
Nothing can bold it back. The
mining industry will be directly
responsible for this big growth.
New strikes are being made every
day close to Baiter Springs, and
every day the town is full of peo
ple who are asking about matters
and things, all germane to the
growth and prosperity of our
town. t
And right here we wish to give
a wora ot caution to mose wno
own large numbers of pieces of
vacant property. Do not put your
prices so high, if some one wants
a . a 4
a piece ot property, mat iney
cannot afford to pay the price,
but be reasonable on some of it
at least, so that a number of
buildiogs will be put up this
spring and summer. More homes
are needed in Baxter Springs tban
anything else at the present time.
Business is well enough repre
sented. We must get and main
tain a reputation for supporting
our business institutions, and not
get an unenviable reputation of
starving tbem because there are
too many. Mo-e population in a
lot of nice new homes will do a
great deal to make Baxter Springs
the best town in the country. .

It's a Mistake
To think training isn't a factor a very
important factor in taking care of one's future.
Many people have money left to them but
lack the special training needed to properly
care for it it gets away.
If YOU expect to have money left to you
later on in life you will need training in order
to be able to give your interests the vigilant
care they will demand if you are to hold your
own or build for a larger success.
This training is only acquired by actual
practice. No other method for gaining it is so
good, so business-like, so safe as the Bank Ac
count method.
Start YOUR training NOW by coming in
and opening an account with us one dollar
will get you started add to it as you can.
