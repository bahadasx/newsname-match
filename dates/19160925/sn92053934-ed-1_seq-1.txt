Mutcalf Assails Railroads.
In his address President Metcalf as
sailed the railroads in strong terms
for the transportation facilities afford
ed the shippers during the past year,
asserting that they have tx--n "un
usually inferior, inadequate, and ex
tremely unsatisfactory."
"It seems to he a self-evident fact,"
Mr. Metcalf declared, "that the rail
ways are growing more incompetent
every year to take care of the nhip
Eents of grnin offered them for trans
portation. This condition of affairs
makes the handling of grain very
fcaiardous and contributes in no small
degree to the. uncertainty of our bus
iness. Advocates Rigorous Measures.
"We bdievo the time has come when
rigorous measures of some descrip
tion should be had to compel the car
riers to furnish proper equipment for
the transportation of grain offered
thm by shippers. Carriers insist that
it Is Impossible for them to make such
provision because of tb depletion of
profits caused by the greatly increas
ed coat of labor 'and material and that
reifcht and passenger rates do not
jJs'ify them in making expenditures
Hf-reesary U) rre the evil.
"We do not desire to controvert this
sertton, but we do insist that it
houll b shown by them that this is
tr'-e. As to whether these allegations
