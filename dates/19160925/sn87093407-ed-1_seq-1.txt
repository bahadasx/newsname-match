JEWS AGAINST CHANGE
Sy KENNETH W. PAYNE
NEW YORK, Sept. 2S —
"Should any church abbrevi
ate tha ten commandmentef
"Moat certainly NOI"
This la tha dictum of Dr.
Samuel Schulman, proa I dent of
tha central conference of Amer
ican rabble, and hlmaetf rabbi
of tha groat temple Bethel in
Now York.
•He makes It aa a result of
tha proposal to boll down tha
tan commandmanta given by
God to Moaaa thouaanda of
yaara ago.
The propoeal. to be considered
by tbe convention of the Protest
ant Episcopal church In St. l<ouls
ta October, is stirring oppoaitlon In
many quarters. Tha Episcopalians,
many of them, urge that brevity In
tka form of the commandments Is
*olns to result Id added emphasis
ta their moaning.
Qualified ta Speak
Rabbi Schulm.in, aa member of
Bba board of editors of the English
of the Bibla for the
'JnafOfUA and aa a noted contrib
utor to Jewish religious literature.
!la in a poeitlon to dlacoaa most
authoritatively tha scheme to cui
oot parts of the commandmenta
"Tha question aa to whether the
original form of the ten command
ments was the shortest one." be!
said, "Is of conraa not a new one.
It la tha opinion of many represen
tativaa of tha critical school, but;
there cannot be any absolute ear
talnty In tbe matter.
Shartneea Shews Untruthfulneaa
"I should venture to say that,
tha vary captivating character of
tha simplicity of the short form.;
which la used aa an argument for!
It, la a PROOF of Its untruthful-1
noes! I should rather aseumn that
tha complete symmetry of this
form which wa. so to speak, would
naturally expect la rather an arti
ficial result'of our own theorising
I believe tha longer form la tbe
original form.
"Tha varlatlona of th« word-
Ing In Exoduo and Deuteron
omy are wall known and, with
mopoct to the fourth com
mandment concerning the Sab
bath, are moat Important. For
they give a complete theory of
tha Sabbath. The one In Eaa
dua emphasises tha Sabbath
aa an Inetltutlon for Qod, and
tha ana In Deuteronomy em
phaaiiea it aa an Institution
for man, teaching the demo
cratic dignity of all human
belnga and their equality In
being entitled ta a weekly day
ef rest.
"For teaching purpoeea In the
modern Jewish Sunday school we
give the commandments In an sb- j
brevlated form to the very loweet,
grades, but aa soon as the children
sre old enough we make them
memorise the commandmaota Inl
their present form.
Jaws Wouldn't Change Them
"Aa to whether it la advlaable
fer any church to ahorten the com
mandments I certainly would aay
no' CERTATNI.Y THE JEWISH!
rmmcH wocr,n not think
or ST'CH A THING!
"In tbe so-called additions which
ara aaaumed by those who propose
tha change to have been made to
the shorter form of the command
nienta, there are contained very [
important points of doctrine and
fundamental truths of religion.
"For example, to the Jewiah rellg
ions conscience the second com
msndment prohiblta the dedlflra
tlon of anything In nature and even
of any human form or any human
example In life. To aay that the
commandment is limited to the
words 'thou shalt hsve no other
gods before me,' would mean quite
a mutilation of the preaent form of
the commandment and a destruc
tion In great measure of much of
ltd spirit!"

Lure of Naughty
Pictures Leads
1,000 to Licking
More than 1,000 prominent Seattle men have
actually been spanked with a rubber hose by Ed
Murray, a clerk in the city comptroller's office, during
the last three weeks because of their curiosity to look
at naughty pictures.
The list includes superior court judges, city
councilmen, heads of city and county departments,
dozens of lawyers, and an assorted crew of others,
some of them from other cities.
Because each victim wanted to see his friend
spanked, the news has been kept quiet.
Many of the names are now on record in the
comptroller's office, and the list reads like a professional
directory, blue book and city directory, all in one.
"Have you seen the Seattle blackmail pictures?"
whispered Murray to a fellow worker, one day three
! weeks ago.
"No," was the reply.
"Well, they're going to be destroyed tomorrow,"
he went on, "if you want to see them I can fix it up
for you."
