cultural commissioner, one of the
most Important and far reaching cam-1
paigns to promote the Industrial and!
agricultural resources of West Vlr-j
glnla has beon Inaugurated by tho
state department of agriculture.
An organized effort 13 now under I
way to bring to the attention of largo
manufacturers of the vast possibilities
of the state, not only as to natural re
sources, but raw materials, markets

To this end Mr. Williams has
taken up the matter with tho prin
cipal coal operators of tho state. It

co-operation so as to be placed tn

cardinal advantages offered to locate
within the state.

With statistical data and other
; detail, It Is believed a large num

j convinced of the superior advantages
I the state affords.

of the state's resources. Mr. Williams

ular program used In the principal
theaters throughout the country.
Campnijm a Success.
This campaign of publicity hu
proved very successful and profitable,
notably in tho northwestern states
where thousands of settlerB have been
attracted by this visual preservation
of the possibilities. Railroads and
other powerful influences are expect,
ed to aid In this movement. When

Republican Committee
Has Able Secretary
Charles G. CofTman, Secretary of Rc
The Republican party In West Vir
ginia Is fortunate this year In having
as the secretary of Its state executive
committee a man of keen intellect and
great executive ability In the person
of Charles G. CofTman, of this city.
Mr. Coffman, who Is well known over
the state committee, will be on the
county, where he has spent all his
life, knows political conditions In the
state like a book; and no one doubts
that ho Is the right man for the Job.
As Joseph H. Gaines, chairman, of
the state oommlttee, will go on the
stump a great part of the time, much
of the executive work around state
headquarters will fall on the shoul
ders of Mr, Coffman. That he will
SU Mr. Gaines's shoes with eminent
success goes without saying.
Mr. Coffman Is a native of .Harri
son county and comes from a family
known throughout the state. He is a
graduate of both Salem College and
publican State Executive Committee.
West Virginia University, graduat
ing from the former In 1838 and from
the latter in 1904. Immediately after
getting his diploma from the state
university he opened law offices In
this city and has built up large prac
tice. He was chairman of the Repub
lican county executive committee In
1901 and 1906, and in the latter
year was the Republican nominee tor
mayor of the city. He was elected
to the state senate In 1908 and served
there until 1912 with great credit
both, to himself and to the district
which he represented. In 1909 Mr.
Coffman was happily married to Mlsi
Alma Barle Haymaker, daughter of
Mr. and Mra. Frank B. Haymaker,
They have one son, Frank Haymaker,
Hve years of age.
Older politicians who have watched
Mr. Coffman'a work at state head
quarters this year, are freely predict
ing that he will be a big figure in
state politics in a few years.
