BERMUDA IS SIP
T
f Despite the fact that the big asphalt
plant of the Kaw Paving Company;
has been removed to McKlnney for
stay of three weeks. It seems to have
little effect on the shipment of mate
rials for paving work. There has
been more .material unloaded on the
ground where the big plant Is operat
ed In the past few days than has ever
been within the same length of time
since the paving work started several
weeks ago. This is due, according to
the paving contractors, to the fact
that since the strike has been order
ed called off, it la no trouble to get
the railroads to accept shipments for
Immediate delivery.
In the course of two or three weeks,
or by the time the big asphalt plant
Is returned to Bryan, the base on the
west side of College avenue will have
been completed and the contractors
will have enough material on band to
rush through with the top coating and
the street will be opened for traffic
all the way through. It Is predicted
by City Knglneer A. S. Adams that
the completion of this work and the
completion of the Bryan end of the
A. and M. Collego road will be about
the same time and then the Joy riders
will be turned loose on a good long
stretch of road at the same time.
