8T. JOSEPH, Mo., Sept 23.—When
the fall term of the criminal court
opened today, Special-Prosecutor Bart
Lockwood asked the court to call
the grand jury to hear the charge of
wife murder against County Prose
cutor Oscar McDaniels, arrested at
his home here last night Lockwood
will ask an indictment alleging Mrs.
McDaniels had threatened divorce
and was slain after a quarrel.
Lockwood will oharge that McDan

14, as Mrs.*McDaniels supposed that
McDaniels returned home atiout ten
o'clock, was reproached for his de
ceptions and threatened with public
exposure, the quarrel reaching the
climax in the beating of Mrs. McDan
iels to death. The special prosecutor
will also charge that the "fake tele
phone call" was McDaniel's invention
and a part of a plan to divert suspi

for his official acts.
Lockwood will charge farther that

NEW YORK, Sept 25.—More peo
ple have been killed and injured by
automobiles on the streets of Ameri
can cities during this year, than in aU
the Zeppelin raids on England. Chi
cago and New York lead in the num
ber of deaths with more than 200
each between January first and Sep

in other large cities is proportionate
ly high, however, varying with the
population of the towns.
These figures, compiled today, on
reports from a score of cities are
based upon police records, which
show a constantly growing death list
as a result of automobile accidents,
despite improved traffic laws that
have been. e&acted. In New_ Yortc and
other states, even more drastic legis

In the cities from which reports
were available today, figures up to

In many cities heavy penalties are

AN APPALLING RECORD FIERCE BATTLE RAGES
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent
DAYTON, Ohio, Sept. 25.—Repub
lican Nominee Hughes brought his
policies into the Buckeye state today,
beginning a three day oratorical mar
athon.
Because his throat Is still Inflam
ed and his vocal chords frayed by
his long distance speaking in Indiana,
Mrs. Hughes and the nominee's phy
sician, Dr. iL. tR. Alexander, Jr., for
bade any out of door speeches here
in Dayton. The local committee,
therefore, made up for lack of
speeches from the candidate by a
program which sought to show him
off to the populace from morning till
night
Hughes arrived at Dayton shortly
before 9 o'clock and was met by a
reception committee, headed by J. J.
Nevln. Later In the day Governor
Frank B. Willis, of Ohio, was due to
join the "nomination special" and
travel with the party during Hughes'
stamping in Ohio. First of all today,
the candidate was whisked off to the
soldiers' home. Then at 11:30 he
was to make a speech before the
League of Republican Clubs. This
afternoon he was d®e- "to jrat in
appearance and review a parade at
the state fair grounds and tonight to
deliver his big speech of the day at
the city auditorium. In between
times, he expected to confer with
Ohio republicans on the political out
look.
Hughes begins the second week of
his second campaign tour In splendid
physical and mental shape, but very
much bothered as to voice. So far
as punch and pep is concerned, the
former governor of New York has
"come back" to his highest efficiency
as a campaigner right now. But the
superhuman efforts at stumping he
made in Indiana have left his voice
in such shape that it Is an obvious
effort for him to talk. He is forced
at all times to remember he must
conserve his organ of speech and that
slows him up ju&t a trifle in his de
livery as well as it forces him to
speak in a harsh monotone. No man
in public life is more stimulated or
more responsive to crowds than the
and energy—or at least as nearly
bubbling with enthusiasm and energy
as a former supreme court justice
can bubble.
(Hughes plans to make the tariff
and Americanism his main themes in
Ohio speeches during the next few
days. The spectre of closed factories
after the end of the European war
if the democratic principle of a tariff
for revenue only is continued, which
the nominee so stirringly Invokes,
made a big hit in Indiana and the
candidate is of the opinion it will be
an equally potent campaign argu
ment here In Ohio.
