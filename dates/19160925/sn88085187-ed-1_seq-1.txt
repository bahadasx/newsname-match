Tacoma's "Bad Man" Who
Would Not Be Saved Does
All Convicts Grave Iniurv
By E. A. Peters
John lliblebiuntil, the man
who would not be saved!
lie lives In the Emergency
hospital at Seattle, paralyzed
fiun the hips to his toes, the
victim of n policeman's bul
let. Ills right hand was torn
away years ago when his
sleeve became tangled In one
of the huge grinding ma
chines of the Walla Walla
prison jute mill.
He is a maimed and pitiful ob
ject, this man who would not be
saved.
Yet no one Reem* to pity Jo^n.
Unless possibly the mother who
gave him birth ls still alive.
John Hlldebrandt is an cx-con
vht. a Tacoma boy who haa spent
17 years, more than half his life,
behind prison bars. For- 15 years
of the 1 7 he was an active enemy
of society. During the last two
years of his prison life he has pro
claimed to his fellow convicts that
bis soul had undergone a regen
eration. He had changed from a
brute-man into a human with a
lo<(. for humanity.
Sent Up for Murder.
At least, the prison authorities
■o believed htm.
Warden Drum determined lo
bring a climax to ht:< experimental
transformation of John Hllde
bntndt, and he Induced Got. Lis
ter to give the convict a condi
tional pardon. Join was a "lif
er," sent up for murder.
And the convict had only been
out of prison a month when ha
held up an urprotactml yaws a In
Seattle. A mounted policeman
tried to arrest him. Shots were
exchanged, and one or the offi
cer's bullets found lodgment
among the nerve centers of the
bandit's spine.
Hildebrandt would not le
saved, and as punishment he must
spend tbe rest of his life with a
pair of lifeless limbs.
Met Him In Prison.
During the five days that I
served last spring as a voluntary
convict In Walla Walla ln order to
obtain a true picture of prison life
I met John Hildebrandt.
Never having beard his his
tory, I found nothing about the
one-armed convict to set him
apart from the 700 others If blue
gray suits. He was a mild, af
fable prisoner, with a "trusty" po
sition in the prison library. He
sp-.k. little, but was not morr»s«.
After the prison authorities
had learned my identity and re
leased me, Warden Drum shewed
ire the "proof" of an artlc'.e that
had been printed for tbe prison
magantze, "Our View Point."
The article had been written by
Hildebrandt. It waa a master
piece of its kind, and was later
published verbatim by the convict
editors.
Hlldebrant told of bis early ex
perience In Walla Walla. He spoke
of the horrible tortures of former
administrations. Of the dungeon
sentences, and the torture of the
stream of cold water turned upon
the convlcta' naked bodies, and
the whippings that were a regular
course of prison discipline.
Hildebrandt waa then one of

the pioneers among the prisoners,
but other convlcta told me that
every word of his story was true.
".-.lui-der and suicide were com
mon ln those days," wrote the
convict.
"Tbe Impressions are still so
vivid ln my memory that even
now I sometimes awake ln a cold
sweat. The dying, unearthly
ahieks of some unfortunate as he
leaped to kind death from the top
tier of the cell hfluse, are still
ringing in my ears."
Records show that tortues
caused many to commit suislde.
"I spent five years in soli
tary confinement In Five
AVing for refusal to work
longer in tlie jute mill after
having lost my arm in the
machinery, and finally had to
give In, as I got so weak from
lack of proper food and ex
ercise that I was carried over
to the hospital to die."
Hildebrandt had served 14
years in Walla Walla, after start
