tem on Kauai. The laborers did .not
make any complaint to me. ...
"At Koloa plantation the laborers are
given beautiful homes to live. In and
they are kept as nice as many of. the
residences In this city. At first I did
net-know that some of these .houses
were common laborers homes, j; I met
some of the most prominent people oi
Kauai and ihey tolcT me that there Is
no labor' trouble on that island be

ers.' v ' i:.--."Without
my advice the -laborers
will make their permanent homes on
Kauai. It has often been; reported
that the camps at the plantations of
that island need improvement but
this is not so. "the dwellings that the
plantations furnish to the laborers are
fine. I was told by managers that
these quarters are . cleaned by the
plantations at their expense. What
more can theHaborers expect?
"I have vno complaints to make
against the plantations for their treat
ment of laborers ; but I discovered
that among). tin: laborers there is too
much extravagance and too " many
small Japanese stores. , '
"The financial condition of the la
oorers is becoming poor on account of
easy , money. I found that some la
borers have spent as. much as $200
for the celebration of a child's birth
day. I emphasized that they, must be
very economical in. their daily lives.
Japanese merchants In this city must
be careful of their Kauai trade and not
give too much credit to the laborers
cn that island.
"I especially emphasized that they
must not spend their money in unnec
essary '.ways;. They have everything
that is necessary from, the plantation,

The city attorney's office- is busy
today drawing u? a proceeding in

to whether the board of supervisors

trict fund for tne purpose of building
a school house at Pearl City.
According to A. M. Cristy, deputy

to take money from a special fund
for other uses, but when Supervisor
Dan Lbean pointed out a section in the
