WA-SIIINCTON, Sept. 2.. I.very
possibie unit of federal machinery
today was sot. in motion to meet ana
deal with the continued advance in
the price of broad throughout the
country. Through the federal trade
commission, and the department of
justice. the national covernmnit
will U'Kin at once a country-wide
survey of bread prices to determine
whether the taure of the continued
increase is legitimate and to re
move it if it is not.
A Hood of complaints ami peti
tions setting forth the advance in
bread prkes. is swamping various
.government departments. Many of
them set forth only threatened in
creases in prices as a ground for
omplaint. but the trado commission
and the department of justice have
instructed all of their agents to
advise Washington just as son as
any real advance is made: Inci
dentally the agents will also keep
their eye on milk prices which have
been the basis for further com
plaints. I'mharuo Surjrotcd.
Many of the complaints suggested
an embargo on the export of wheat
and Hour as the solution of the
bread price increase. Several enor
mous p-titions from bakers' organ
izations have been directed to the
trade commission. dec la rim; that
unless an embargo is imposed on
their raw materials, they will be
forced to send bread prices op to
10 cents a loaf. The cry of "feed
America first." however, is making
but little impression on the admin
Ht rat ion.
Kealiinir that an embat-o on

ommo .Ii ties, federal officials are
opposed to action which would
hamper the f irmer who is holding

that radically would affect hi sell

PASS IIP STRIKE
Leaders Are Having Trouble
in Lining Up New
York Workers.
Intornation.il News Service:
NEW YORK. Sept. 2'.. Prospects
for a city-wide walkout threatened
for Wednesday morning In sympathy
with the striking carmen, seemed
remote early today. Otticials of the
conference of labor leaders, which
promulgated the suspension of
work by 00,000 wage earners, are
making frantic efforts to translate
their threat into action, but indica
tions point to strong opposition
amoii many of the individual
unions.
The prime movers of the proposed
seneral strike early today an
nounced that 60 more labor organ
izations, with the total membership
of 12O.00U. have pledged their sup
nort to the conference of labor
leaders and will remain away from j
their places Wednesday morning.
Combined with the f.U.OOO waste
earners who already have ratified
the vote to suspend the total num
ber on which the leaders now rely
is 17:uou.
The only onions, however, that
are known to have actually voted
for a strike are the butchers and
the longshoremen. The decision of
the former has to be ratified by the
individual locals. In the case of the
latter it is repotted the de '.nion was
opposed by many individual mem
bers. Ernest IJohm. spokesman for the
i i.n r.i-eice of labor leaders, early!
today voiced the certainty that "the
battle will be won in two days." lie
asserted t hat unions in other parts
in New Vork state and in New Jer
sey were leady to enlist in the cause
of the striking carmen.
Chairman Oscar Straus, of the
public service commission, today re
newed his appeal to the tract'on
companies to arbitrate on the
jruand that tl e public has the
iiuht to demand arbitration.
"There arc tie million persons in
nowise responsible for this con
troversy who hae been the chief
Mltt'elels because of it." said Mr.
Straus. "They hae a ll'-ht to de
mand that thi- tpaariel be ar
bitrated. "Neither the traction companies
nor the employes have been free
from wroiiic. and the ublie is tired

Bell Says Expeditions Sent
After Bandit Have Not
Fired a Single Shot
at the Outposts.
International News Service :
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 2',.
Indications today as the Ameri
can and Mexican commissioners
went into joint session here were
that the negotiations have reached
a deadlock.
Acting, it is believed, on instruc
tions from Pres't Wilson, the Amer
ican commissioners have refused
flatly to consider any plan calling
for the immediate withdrawal of
the American troops. This stand
has been taken because of the in
Creasing activity of Yillist'is in Chi
huahua and the failure of the Car-
ranza forces to make a strong
showing against them. The Mexican
commissioners, bound by Carranza's
instructions to take up the with
drawal of the troops first, refused
to make any concessions.
It was considered likely that an
adjournment will be taken either
toda.' or tomorrow until the .Mex
ican commissioners can pet new
instructions from Carranza.
The Mexican commissioners, as
they went into today's meeting', re
fused to discuss the signed state
ment of Carranza, issued in Mexico
City, declaring that he had instruct
ed the commissioners to take up
only the withdrawal of the Amer
ican troops. The American com
missioners also refused to discuss
the matter, but plainly intimated
that they were Koing to ask the
Mexican members about Carranza's
statement. It was indicated that
the negotiations would come to a
sudden ending if the Mexicans re
fused to discuss problems relating to
the border patrol for the future.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 27,. Unas
sailable evidence from competent
sources reached Washington today
indicating that the Carraniiista sol
diers in northern Chihuahua are
making no effort to interfere either
with the Villista or le?alista bands
operating there. This evidence is
being used in bolstering up their
refusal to consent to the withdrawal
of the Pershing expedition and the
turning over to the Carranzistas of
the problem of border protection.
A supplemental report from (Jen.
George Pell, commanding at El
Paso, received today, gives detailed
information alomj this line. It
Pat ly charges that the expeditions
sent in pursuit of Villistas by Gm.

contented themselves with locating

cording to th information received

of all kinds and have enormous
iiiantities of ammunition. In ad
dition to this they have machine

Another report received from
agents of the state department today
recited the hold-up of a passenger
train in tho vicinity of Iluachita
canon by bandits. The passengers
- among whom were several Amer
ieans were not mclested by the
bandits who simply told them they
wanted to :.nv that the de facto

So bold were the swindlers, the

before a fake United States commis

HASN'T RECOVERED FROM THAT THIRD
TWO ZEPPELINS
British Hope to Find Secrets
in Construction of Ger
many's Big Airships.
International News Service;
LONDON, Sept. 2 3. Officers of
the royal flying corps have begun
an examination of the two Zeppelins
brought down during the raid of
Saturday ni.ht and Sunday morning,
with a view to discovering secrets
of their construction. The raid, in
which more than a dozen great air
ships took part, was the most ambi
tious yet attempted against England
by the Germans and it was the first
time that an air fleet had been con
voyed by submarines.
The destruction of three Zeppelins,
two i-n the latest raid and one in a
previous air foray against Ixmdon,
caused ret. jubilation und leads to
the belief that the metropolis soon
will be immune froia sky attacks.
Considerable damage was done on
the eastern and southeastern coasts,
by the loss of two of the big, new
styled Zeppelins more than offset
the losses from a military stand
point. The charred remains of the air
men killed in the destruction of tho
Zeppelin near Mangold. Essex coun
ty, have ben collected for an inquest.
Thy yrobably will be buried with
military honors as was the case with
the Germans killed when the L-21
was burned.
The sailors on the other Zeppelin
brought down in Essex county are
expected to be treated as honorable
prisoners of war de?pite the intense
public feeling agrainst them.
