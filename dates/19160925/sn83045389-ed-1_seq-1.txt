I ?eiiioci a11<? vote ever polleil in the his

a matter both of party and of nationa;
patriotism with bi-moi rats to see to it
that a President who has made such
a record as that made by President
?"Wilson shall not be repudiated at the

?'The strength of the President"*
! cause among? the Independent. Progres
sive and Hepubliean voters has been
shown in the many announcements of
accessions of leaders and voting bodies
' from these sources which have been
made from time to time by the nation

'rapidly multiplying number of Wilson
Marshall el ibs which are not or
gan./.ed along party lines, and in the
?-nrollment of which in every State are
i? i be found the names of thousands
: of men and women who have not here
; tofore and do not now class themselves
, as Democrat'. It is exemplified also ;n
. the scope and magnitude of the work

I.eague, which, under the presidency of
: the Hon. William Kent, of California,
I the only independent member of Con
