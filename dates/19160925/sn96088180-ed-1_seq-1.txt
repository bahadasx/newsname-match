mittee In charge, was matter of cere
monies, and gracefully presented the
apeakeri who were upon the program.
The mining question was before the

give his views of how beat to get the
facts regarding the district before the
people. Mr. Peck 'believes that min
ing men should be Interested In the
district as a whole rather than In In
dividual mines or prospects, and In
vited to coma and personally Inspect
the offers that are made. He believed
the distribution of local newspapers
which contain articles dealing with
the mineral resources of. the district
would prove the best form of pub
licity, and he advocated the distribu
tion of such newspapers In quantity.
P. C. Smith warned the community
to beware of the man who would at
tempt to exploit something simply for
the purpose of lining his own pockets,
and -aid that even so nood a district
as southern Oregon would bo greatly
trj.ircd by fly-by-nlght schemers, He
tint- thit the people give their ap
proval n'ly to proven propositions.
John Hampshire, of the Queen of
nronse mine, spoke of the wonderful
extent of the mineral resources, and
said that the community could co
operate by'the building and main
tenance of roads and highways so
that mines not situated upon the rail
roads would be permitted to develop
and add to the payroll of the dis
trict. Mr. Fields, who Is here represent
ing a concentrating process by which
ores are handled without the amok
nuisance of the common smelter, told
briefly of his company, and stated
that negotiation- were now pending
y which It wuh possible his com
psny would estahllr.lt Us plant In this

that was under consideration for the
establishment of a mining bureau as
. an adjunct to the Commercial club,
' and It. B. Miller mado one of his
happy nnd optimistic talks. Mr.
Miller called attention to the great
wealth of .material here to command
the notice of the people of the com
munity. The aubjoct that will bo considered

that of getting ample acreage for
planting to sugar boots for the next
season, and tho lend In tho discussion
