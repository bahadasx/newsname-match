ZEPPELIN LOSS

During Raid*
LARGE FLEfiT IN
ATTACK ON LONDON
Many Killed or Wounded by Exploding
Bombs—Berlin Statement Says Muoh
Property Was Destroyed, British
Report Makes Denial Third Zep
pelin Damaged—French Airmen
Raid Over Essen.
Berlin, Sept. 25.—Extensive fires were
observed to have been caused by the
Zeppelin bombardment of London and
the midland counties on Saturday night,
it was announced today in the official
report. Two of the Zeppelins were lost
as the result of the fire of anti-air craft
guns in London, the statement adds.
The statement says:
"During the night of Sept. 23-24,
several naval airships dropped bombs
on London, on places of military impor
tance and on midland counties. Large
fires were everywhere observed to re
sult. these remaining visible for a long
time.
"Previously, before crossing the Brit
ish coast, the aircraft were fired on by,
guard vessels and during the attack it
self were under a heavyv fire from in
cendiary shells. Two of the airships
fell victims to anti-air craft, guns at
London."
British Denial of Air Damage.
London, Sept. 25.—Regarding the
German official report on the Zeppelin
raid the official press bureau today
states:
"In addition to the fact that no anti
air craft defenses and places of mili
tary importance-were damaged this ac
count of the raid waa filled with the us
ual misstatements."
TWO ZEPPELINS DESTROYED.
Crew of One Killed, Others Captured
During Raid Over England.
London, Sept. 26.—Of the twelve big
Zeppelins which Invaded the British
Isles Saturday night to,deal death and
destruction from the skies two today
lay. -sVs*k ajnd Ma$k masses of steel
and •aWm'lntjn/ h? the kittle village* of
Mangold, Essex county. They fell vic
tims of the anti-aircraft defenses of
London and outlying districts.
One came down a flaming torch, as
did the Zeppelin L-3t, destroyed three
weeks ago, while the second,- disabled
by gunfire, effected a landing, which
saved the lives of the crew of twenty
two, who are prisoners in England.
The crew of the first raider died in
the consuming flames of their own
ship, but they were not so terribly
charred as their predecessors.
Thousanda See Raider Fall.
This latest raider to light her own
funeral way on English soil collapsed
and was consumed much more quickly
than the L-21. It is possible, though,
that some of the men were still living
when the great vessel struck the
ground. The captain's body was found
some distance from the wreck.
The death. and burning of the first
Zeppelin was witnessed by tens of
thousands of London residents, but the
wounding and descent of the second
raider was a matter of doubt until to
day's official statements were given
out.
Few details are available of this sec4
ond raider's condition, but it Is
liably reported that the crew surren
dered to special constables.
Many who saw the shrapnel burst
ing "like skyrockets about the invader,
which subsequently caught fire, think
there must have been several direct
hits. Many aeroplanes were aloft and
attacked the Zeppelins from ail sides,
30 Killed, 116 Wounded.
The raiders took a heavy toll of lives
before their destruction, twenty-eight
persons being killed and ninety-nine
wounded in the metropolitan district of
London. Two persons were killed?
probably four, and several were wountK
ed, in the provinces.
The property damage, while widely
distributed, is confined for the most
pa^t to small suburban dwellings and
smps, altho one railway station was
damaged, some empty cars being de
stroyed and part of the tracks torn up.
The roar of the dropping bombs was
heard in many districts where the
raiders were invisible. It is not be
lieved that more than two or three In
vading Zeppelins which crossed the
east coast succeeded in reaching the
environs of London. That two of these
paid the death penalty gives the great
est satisfaction to the military author
ities.
Apart from the loss in material, the
casualties of the last two raids, it is
believed, will have a depressing effect
on the morale of the Zeppelin crews in
the future.
Little Damage, Say* Berlin.
Berlin, Sept. 26.—No fires were caus
ed at Essen by the hostile air raids yes
terday and most of the .bombs dropped
inflicted no damage. The statement
follows:
"The commander at Miiinster reports
that on Sept. 24 several enemy airmen
appeared over the suburbs of Essen.
They dropped several bombs, the most
of which caused no damage. There were
no fires."
Crippled Zeppelin Obaerved.
London, Sept. 26.—Danish fishermen

'GET VILLA" ORDER RECALLED.
President Wilson Revokes Command—
Does Not Now Want Bandit.
Washington, Sept. 25. President
Wilson no longer cares anything about
getting Villa dead or alive.
Admission of this fact was made
here by Secretary of War N. D. Baker
following his return from a campaign
stumping tour.
The admission was made In connec
tion with an attempt by Mr. Baker to
discredit reports forwarded by General
Frederic Funston from General George
Bell and other officers on the border
concerning the renewed activities of
Villa in northernl Mexico and particu
larly the report made hy General Bell
on the capture of Chihuahua.
Mr. Baker flatly rejected the ver
sion of the capture of Chihuahua last
Saturday which General Bell transmit
ted. Mr. Baker accepted the state
ment of the Carranza commander at
Chihuahua, General Trevlno, and the
explanation offered by the Mexican em
bassy here. These were In direct con
tradiction of the statements made by
General Bel].
Villa's spectacular comeback and the
publication of the colorful report from
General Bell concerning It have com
pletely upset the plans made by the
president and Secretaries Lansipg and
Baker for a general settlement of the
Mexican trouble just before election
day.
It is believed here that the vtiia raid
Instead of weakening Carranxa's posi
tion at New London will serve to
strengthen It. It Is believed here now
that Carranza will go as far as to ae
ject the proposals for a joint policing
of northern Mexico and refuse to per
mit the conference to achieve any end
unless the whole matter Is left in his
care.
