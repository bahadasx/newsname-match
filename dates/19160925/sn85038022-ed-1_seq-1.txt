VALUABLE FARM
In Ohl rnnhawd II) Mr. la T. An

On Friday Mr. L. T Anderson, deal
er In high-class horses, closed a deal
through Thomas I. Kwan Co., real
estate agents, for the 306 acre farm
of the late Dr. (luthrlo. located near
Manchester, Ohio. In the deal Mr.
Anderaon (tela the entire herd of nhout
3d reglatered I'oled Annus cattle, all
the farming Implement, machinery
work atock, and growing. crops that
are on the farm. Thla la one of the
beat tobacco and atock farma in that
aectlon of the country, as there are
four large baniH and two or threi
houses on the farm, alBo an abundanc;
of bluegrass and alfalfa on the place
Mr. Anderaon haa not decided yet
whether he will continue thla herd of
fine cattle on his farm or whether hr
will later offer them for Bale. Th
chances are however that Mr Ander
aon will continue the herd aa he has
for some time been of the opinion that
the breeding of thoroughbred cattle in
thla locality would pay and with thla
hlgh-claaa heard to atart with we
would not be surprised to see him en
gaged In the breeding of this strain
of cattle on a large scale aa he is the
owner of two large farms here in
Kentucky, it is to be hoped that Mr
Anderson will engage in the breeding
of fine cattle as it would metfn much
to the cattle industry of this section
as hiB success In the handling of high
class horses has been so pronounced
that should he engage in the cattle
business he would doubtless do much
to bring up the standard of the breed
ing of cattle in this immediate section.

"The Square Deal Man"
The operatora and employees of the
Central Telephone and Telegraph Co
experienced a delightful time while in
this city and all were made to feel
that they were entirely welcome and
that they had in their possession the
keys of the city. About 66 out of
town visitors were present for the oc
casion. The afternoon was visitors day at
the local exchange and hundreds
thronged the offices of the company.
The offices were decorated and all
were thrown open. To each of the
ladles attending a beautiful rose was
given. Employes of the company were
ptvsent to explain the workings of the
new system that has been installed
here. The system, simple in its com
plexity, is one of the best In the en
lire United States. Those who watch
ed the operators, busy at their switch
board could not but feel impressed at
the way the calls were answered. The
visitors all saw that the time worn
chestnuts about the slowness of the
telephone opcrtors have about served
their time, for, not only were the
calls answered promptly, but the con
nection with the party wanted wan
given almost instantly. The formal
opening of the new exchange was nlso
held in the afternoon.
At 7:30 o'clock in the evening a
sumptuous banquet was served to the
operators at the Central Hotel. Col
onel Daugherty furnished a menu
that a king would not dispise. City
Attorney J. M. Calhoun made the wel
coming address to the operators in
the absence of Mayor Iee. Mr. W. M.
I'alne of Louisville gave the response.
Following the banquet the company
adjourned to the Knights of St. John
Hall where a number of papers on
the various phases of exchange orK
were read. Following the reading of
the papers dancing was indulged in to
a late hour by the younger operators.
The music for the banquet and dance
was furnished by a Vietrola from th.1
Murphy Jcwelcry Store and was great
ly enjoyed by all.
The following were the out ol towi:
visitors: Mr. and Mrs. J. W. O'Han
