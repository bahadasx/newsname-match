CONFUSION MARKS OPENING
OF SCHOOLS AS CHILDREN
OVERTAX FACILITIES HERE
Despite the infantile paralysis scare
it was estimated by officials of the
'board of education today tha the larg
est registration ever known would
mark the opening of the public schools
for the fall term. It is estimated also
that at least two-thirds of the pupils
will have to go on half time sessions
probably for the entire term because
there are not school rooms enough.
Every portable building owned by the
school board will be put Into use and
probably some more will be built to
meet the demands. Of the ' new
schools now building not a single one
is ready for occupancy and the schools
open with no more rooms than were
used when they closed last summer.
Superintendent of Schools Samuel
J. Slawson estimated this afternoon
that more than 2,000 new pupils had
applied for tuition, although his re
ports from the schools were incom
plete due to the confusion and the
large number of pupils who applied.
Supt. Slawson said that he knew a
number of parents were affected by
the infantile paralysis scare and he
estimated that from 1,800 to 2,000
more pupils would be kept away from
schools for a time ion that account
alone. v
On the first day of school last year
a few more than 19,000 pupils regis
tered. This was about the average
daily attendance although at one time
early in the term the registration
reached more than 21,000. Supt,
