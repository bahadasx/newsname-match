22,000,01)1) LOSSES IN
TWO YEARS OF WAR
The Danish Society for the Study j
of the Social Consequences of the
War, has published a detailed esti
mate of the losses of the belliger
ents.
England according to the official
reports of the British war depart
ment, from Aug. 1, 1914, to July
31, 1916, lost 34,360 officers of
whom 11,555 were killed, 19,343
wounded and 3,462 captured or
missing. From this the society calcu
lates a minimum British losses of
808,463 officers and men, divided as
follows: Dead 188,464. wounded
512,465, captured or missing 107,
534. The British navy up to July 31,
lost 18,777 men, the number of dead
being 16,983. Germany has about
33,000 English prisoners. Turkey
17,827, and Bulgaria 449.
French Lose 3,974,000
France does not publish any re
port of her losses, but from infor
mation received by the Red Cross
and other reliable sources, the soci
ety estimates 870,000 French soldi
ers have been killed, 624,000 totally
disabled and 1,896,080 less serious
ly wounded, while about 400,000
have been captured or art missing,
a total of 3,974,000.
The losses of Germany, which
akin
all the belligerent countries
have published regular and detailed
reports, arc somewhat higher than
those of France. From official lists
of the German army administration
it appears that 893,211 men have
been killed, 720,154 badly and 2.
443,180 less seriously wounded.
This, with 245,000 men reported
missing, brings the German total
losses up to 4,301,545 officers and
men.
Austria, according to official and
other trustworthy reports has lost
2,893,250 men. Of these 523,125
have been killed and 1,775,125
wounded, and 591,000 arc captured
and missing.
Austro-Hungarian losses, however
are much smaller. In France about
80 per cent of the wounded returned
to the front, in Germany 90.5 per
cent and in Austria- Hungary 84.5
per cent.
Italians Losses Secret
Italy keeps her losses secret and
calculations for this reason are diffi
cult. hut is estimated 105,0001
men have been killed, 245,000
wounded and 55,000 captured, or
reported as missing.
Belgium during the first two year;
of the war lost about 200,000 men, 1
of whom 50,000 were killed and '
110.000 wounded. There are 10,000,
Belgian soldiers in the German pris |
on camps.
Swrbia cannot have lost less than
400.000 men, because more than ;
200.000 were captured by Austrians j
an<l Bulgarians, and a loss of 60,000
j dead and 140,00 seems conservative.;

Staggering Russ Losses > ^
Really staggering are the losses of j j
Russia. From semi-official reports it |
appears from August 1, 1914, to | _
February 1. 1916, 900.000 Russian j _
soldiers were killed in action, 187,1
000 died from wounds, 63,000 from
diseases, 2,936,000 were wounded,
985.000 became sick and 2,000,000
were captured or reported missing,
making a total of 7,071.000. Since
February Russia has lost at least
1.500.000 men and the total to July
31 must have been 8,500,000.
ligerents since the beginning of the
The combined eausalties of the bel
war number more than 22,000,000.
About 4,200,000 men have been kill
ed and 1,000,000 died from wounds
and diseases, 1,500,000 are totally
disabled and 3,800,000 have been
captured, or are missing. This means
that the fighting strength of the dif
ferent nations decreased 9,500,000
men, but about one half of the sol
diers killed, captured or disabled
has been replaced by young men,
who reached military age since the
beginning of the war.
