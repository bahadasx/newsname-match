he had received notices from
?irtv trados unions representing
120,000 workers, that thry would
obey the ordcr to suspend work

ihe faatj/'tWO longshoremen's locals,
and twelve of the machinists pre
Tious'.y i >tcd, he said 114 unions,
with a membership of 175,000, had
taken favorablc action on the propo
aitior. to a?5i.-1 the car men.
Mr. Kr.hni rcfused to make public
the name.- aad membership of these
unions. Bcyond his bare assertion
there was little, if any, sipn of ac
tivity in preparing for the suspen
Bion of work.
The faet re~ nined, however, that

CRISIS NEAR
IN RELATIONS
WITH MEXICO

Carranza Expected to

WILL MEET WITH
A FLAT REFUSAL
Villa Upsets Administra
tion Plans to Retire
Before Election.
;rrm Tha TMr-uria Bursan.]
Washington. Sept. 24. - Mexican
Ameriean relations are due to reach a
crisis this week, according to predie
tions in informed quarters here to-day.
Indications of Mexico's Impatience
with the delays of the New London
commission have grown plainer in the
last few days, while the determlnation
of the Administration not to rush mat
ters haa been strenfrthened by the re
ports of Villa's new uprising.
Carraasa'fl plan to call for a show
down will be carried out. it is under
Btood, arithin a few days, and will meet
With 'he flat refusal of this govern
ment io withdraw the Pershing expedi
tiofl from Mexico.
The Administration. it is declared.
will do everything in ita power to avoid
BB open break. It ib particularly de
?ired to admit no new complications j
into the Mexican situation before elec- ,
tion, bai rather to continue and stimu
late the general trend of relations j
towurd completa pacif.cation and under- |
Htandinir. It is the hope of Adnnn-j
M officials that the conclusions
of the conference at New London will J
add a crvwning triumph to the achieve- ?
raeata of th? Presidenfs Mexican pol-j
the m of the Prer-idential elec-.
tion.
Thia triumph. according to plans
that have been somewhat upset by
Villa's sudden reappearance on the
scene. was to have been ar-rompanied by
tho reotitatiaa of Mexico's territory
BOW held i'V Geaeral Pershing and the
demohilization of .the state troops. .
Thera is a llttio bopo that the plans
paay rnaterinlire, but it will depend j
largely on Carran/a's wi'.lingness to aa- I
sist in Preaideai wilsnn's political
game.
From what is known of the Firet
Chief'.- present temper, it is feared
that he will refuse to codperate. Car?
ranza has insisted tiom the beginning I
that the Cr.ited BtBtBfl had n% business j
mixiag in Mexican politics, and it ifl
believcd that he is just as much op
peacd to Mexican interferen -e m Amer?
iean politiea. What he araata ia the
itioo of hn trrritory, and he i<
uaabjo to aaderatsad wip the New
London conference, which was to de
n:s qeootion first of all, has
braached out IbU a debate on Mexico's
internal ftffain without deciding it.
Although army oiiicer.s, even those
who credit tho reports o': Vii!a"< attack
on < biheahua, ?tlll laalot that P<?r
shing's expedition sho^ld ,hase bandits
or arithdraw, thc AdapLiiatratica fears
to recal! the troops. "(ficials point out
that it WOBld be fatal to bfl oblized to
send Pershing into Maxico n ..econd
time in pursuit of tho sanie handit.and
until all daager of a r.ew raid before
e'.aetion ia paat the expedition wil! re
raaifl where It ifl.

Krwarda of 11,500 had been ofTered for
their rescue.
They had auffered greatly from ex
haustinn and laek of food and sleen,
Lut it was not thought their hardships
would cause permanent injury to their
health.
The Dennisons were discovcred in an
abandoned logging camp on the shores
I l Dead Diamead Stream, in the Dart

the country near the Maine bordei and
t<n milea from the hotel from which
they had set out Wednesday afternoon
for a stroll.
Shelter Foond in Shack.
In seekinfe to return they had laat
their bearings, and for two daya had
wandered in quest of habitation. Fri
day they found shelter in an old lum
Ler ahack, where they remained, too
tired to walk any longer, and not
knowing which way to turn. Mrs. Den
nison's feet were so gwollen that it wa<
doubtfol whether she could have con
tiaaad much further.
The lawyer and his wife were found
by Karl Gould an<i Seott <opp. em
