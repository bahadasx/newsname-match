fell from a cliff near Balanced Rock
on tho Hlnkson.
Lattimore went alone for a walk
yesterday afternoon, after asking the
other students at 605 South Fifth
street, where he is rooming, to accom
pany him. He found kindred spirits
In two unknown freshmen who were
likewise on a hike, and the three
went to Balanced Rock. In order
to make a short cut to town, the boys
attempted to descend one of the steep
cliffs on the Hlnkson, and Lattimore,
who was the last to descend, lost his
footing and fell about ten feet and
was knocked unconscious.
He was removed to a nearby road
and his companions started for help

fined for some time for his condition

MURRAY RAX LOWER STICKS
Simpson Beaten in Three-Foot Hurdle
Event Xo Record.
T-.e record time of 14 2-5 seconds
for the 120-yard'hurdles made by Fred
Murray jn Saturday's race was over
three-foot sticks. Word to this effect
was received today by the University
athletic department The three-foot
hurdles for the shorter distance were
in general use twenty years ago, but
the standard height is now three feet
and six inches.
"I want to do away with the Im
pression that Simpson was beaten by
Murray in a regulation hurdle race,"
Coach Schulte said. "The three-foot
hurdle race at Travels Island Satur
day has not been used for twenty
years. It is known as the mongrel
race. Simpson with a little rest and
special training for the event could
make it in 14 or 14 1-5 seconds, I am
sure."
"The train ride of thirty-six hours
and the short rest Simpson had be
fore the race Saturday put him in
poor condition to compete with Mur
ray In any event There is no reason
for students to become alarmed. The
critics In the East know the race It
was and will make due allowances.
Bob will show them all up when he
gets In Europe."

McDAMELS ASKS EARLY TRIAL
State to Try to Show Prosecutor
Planned Wife's Murder.
By United Press.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo, Sept 25. Pre
meditated murder is the theory upon
which the ttate will base its prosecu
tijii of, Oscar McDanlels, prosecutor,
it developed today. The stats will at
tempt to liiow that the murder of his
wife Jul 14 last was planned weeks
in advance and that the alleged quar
rel on the night of the killing served
merely to bring the plan to a climax.
Working on this theory. Special
Prosecutor Bart Lockwood will try
to show that the threats upon Mc
Danlels' life and the anonymous let
ters received weeks before the kill
ing were Inventions of McDanlels as
part of an alibi.
At the time of the murder McDanlels
laid much stress upon a threatening
letter ho received. Handwriting ex
perts will be called to say whether
McDanlels wrote the threatening letter
to himself. The state will contend
that McDanlels as county prosecutor
arranged a set of circumstances and
planned details which he considered
would throw suspicion upon criminals
he had successfully prosecuted.
McDanlels declared this afternoon
he would ask for an early trial. He
Is a candidate for re-election as coun-
tv Drosecutor on the Democratic
ticket, and insisted the people have
a right to know before election
whether he is innocent or guilty. Mc
Danlels said he would furnish any
amount of bond.

Dry Association Speaker
Talks at Christian Church
Last Night.
WET REVENUE SMALL
Says Jlreweries Ars Owned
and Operated by Foreign
Capital.
"The action of Secretary of State
Roach in refusing to add the dry
amendment to the ballot has already
been repudiated by the attorney-general.
The courts will soon have an
opportunity to say whether or not you
shall vote on the question. I expect
to see Missouri become a dry state
November 7."
So said Frank S. Regan of Rock
ford, III., the first man to be elected
to a state legislature on the straight
prohibition ticket In the United States,
while in Columbia yesterday. He Is
en a twenty-day speaking tour of Mis
souri under the auspices of the Mis
souri Dry Federation in the campaign
to make Missouri a dry state at the
November election. He spoke at the
Christian Church last evening.
"The Fool Taxpayer" was the sub
ject of Mr. Regan's speech, which was
accompanied by Illustrations and
figures on a large easel. The speaker
cited figures to show that the amount
of revenue received from saloons and
breweries is small on account of tax
exemptions and the fact that many
breweries are owned by foreign capi
tal and operated under charters
granted In other states. The Anheuser-Busch
Brewing Association
operates under a charter granted in
Illinois, according to Mr. Regan. He
also said that the St Louis Brewing
Association was owned by English
capitalists. The fact that practically
all large corporations in the state
are exempt from taxation by special
legislative permission was cited by the
speaker as a means whereby the state
can secure more revenue than Is now
received from the liquor industry.
The law under which the exemptions
are made has been declared illegal in
Illinois.
Mr. Regan has traveled over the
United States as an advocate of pro-
bibtion since he served in the Illinois
legislature In 1899 and 1900, having
made extensive lecture tours over
many states in campaigns that result
ed in the states becoming dry. He
left this morning for Centralla, whence
he will go to Boonville.
