lola, Kan., Sept. 25. The jury be
fore whom Mrs. Ruby Stevens was
trk d for the murder of Clifford Kist
ner, a young farmer, was unable to
fierce and was discharged by Judge
Foust in the circuit court here at 1
o'clock this afternoon. It had been
considering the verdict since 5 o'clock
Saturday afternoon.
Mrs. Stevens received the verdict
without comment. Her eyes filled
with tears and she slowly walked back
to
wif
Ihe ennntv jail. -Mrs. Ivlsme.,
,.f ih. lsiin man. was not in the
court room when the jury reported.
Judge Foust set the November term
of court as the time for new trial.
Story of Murder.
Clifford Kistner was murdered at
his home near Bayard, this county,
the night of May 21. He was called
;o the door by a young woman who
told his wife that her name was "Mar
urn Lambert." the name of the young
oman for whose death .11am
( .rpet at that time was being tried at
Waukegan, 111. . .
"Clifford Kistner, you have ruined
mv life." the voung woman cried, then
flie fired once and fled into the dark
ness The voung farmer s body fell
near hi wife, who had stepped aside
when "Marion Lambert'' asked for
him.
Mr. Stevens, who had been di
vorced from her husband at Colum
bus Kan., a short time before, was ar
rested within a few hours at Mildred.
Kan., where she said she had expected
to take a train for lola to surrender
to the sheriff. A charge of first de
cree murder was placed against her
i nd in default of SIO.ii'JO" bond, she
was remanded to jail, having re
mained there constantly since her
arrest.
liuliy Was Horn.
Tale from her confinement she
testified during the trial that she had
met Kistner at Kincaid. Kan., three
vears ago, and that she had promised
to marrv him. Before her child was
born ."he asked him for aid but re
ceived none, she testified.
The baby was born at Oronogo.
Mo., last May. She took it to Kin
i aid and. at night, placed it on the
porch of the home of William Uarcy,
a wealthy cattleman, who she be
lieved would give it a good home. Mrs.
Stevens denied recollection that he
had murdered Kistner. She testified
that she remembered going to Bayard
and asking the way to Kistner's home.
"I guess I shot him." she said, but
she remembered little else, not even
the details of her arrest and the state
ment she made shortly afterwards to
County Attorney Anderson at lola.
Her defense was emotional insanity
and the . unwritten law. She is 23
years old.
Thruout the trial, she fat near Mrs,
Kistner, wife of the murdered man.
Occasionally their glances met, but
they did not speak. Mrs. Kistner was
well dressed, despite the fact that sev
eral weeks ago she was found, almost
penniless, working on the Kistner
farm. Mrs. Stevens was dressed in
Mark, her face pallid.
The trial attracted a large crowd
and was one of the most interesting
ever held in this section .of the state.
Several physicians, testifying for the
Mate, declared she was sane at the
lime of the shooting.

Topeka Exposition ow of In
ternational Fame.
INSPECT FAIR PERSONALLY
Twenty-five Representatives to
3Iake Trip to Kansas.
Australia Greatly Interested in
Success of Enterprise.
A sum of $50,000 has been set aside
by the Australian government for a
delegation of twenty-five persons and
an exhibit at the Big Free fair in To
peka next fall. Announcement of this
move, which makes the Topeka ex
position of international fame, was
made today by W. F. Horn, American
representative of the Foreign Press
association of Australia. Mr. Horn is
the government and press representa
tive with headquarters in Topeka. He
lives at 2325 Topeka avenue.
"The Topeka fair has done more to
place Kansas before the eyes of the
people of Australia than any other
method of advertising, Mr, Horn
stated today. "The country is vitally
interested in the proposition. I have
wnt more than 500 conies of the State
Journal containing accounts of the
fair here to the government repre
sentatives in Australia."
In their enthusiasm over the To
peka Free fair last year, it was decid
ed to send $20,000 to Topeka for an
exhibit. Mr. Horn said. The appro
priation came too late, however, and
word has- come that next year $50,000
will be available. A delegation of
twenty-five persons will come to To
peka from Australia. They will stay
here for the fair and then make a tour
of Kansas. They will report condi
tions to their country upon their re
turn to Australia.
Have Views of Kansas.
In speaking of the original interest
in the Big Free fair, Mr. Horn said:
"An item was published in the
Saturday's State Journal relating to
the idea of Topeka's Big Free fair
penetrating clear to Australia, seems
to have created some doubt in the
minds of some, of our people a to
the truth and source of this matter.
The facta are the Queensland people
have become acquainted with Kansas,
her resources and her displays thru
our statistical reports and from
hundreds of photographic views of our
state's natural features, and of im
provements from almost every section
of Kansas.
Head of Free Fair.
"Naturally when the 'Free Fair
Proposition came up and was decided
on, bs a fact, I included some notes
on this matter in the regular com
munication to 'The Week, and nearlv
ZflJTk T.Znn mUenorth of Trieste, accom-
conted this idea of a -Free fir' ,i i
I received dozens of letters making in
quiries about it.
"In the sprinff or early summer of
1915 I sent to Mr. Ford, then of the
treasury department, for '.he Agricui i
tural and Pastoral society, the names !
of Mr. Samuel e. Lux and Mr. j. will i
Kelley, in order that the matter could
be handled more satisfactorily to all
parties. I took and mailed fifty views
of the Frea Fair of 1915, several of
which were reproduced in their pa
pers. The idea seemed at least feasible
and steps have been taken to organ
ize a Queensland Free Fair, to be held
during their rr.id-wii:ter season in Au
gust. A fair has been held in Bris-
i bane at this time of the year for
several seasons, but not on a scale
equal to the Topeka fair.
"On Monday, Sept. 11, 1916, I re
ceived a letter from Mr. Ford, enclos
ing an order for a typewriting machine
and a letter asking for full information
regarding our great Free Fair, with
names of the officials in charge, etc.',
with views of the fair displays. Fifty
of these have been forwarded together
with premium lists and copies of the
State Journal containing the accounts
of the fair to Brisbane.
Samples of Products.
I "I now have more than two hun
dred samples of Kansas products on
exhibition in Brisbane, which were
used at their fair in 1915.
"Kansas people should not forge
that the Topeka Free Fair has done
more to place Kansas before the peo
ple of many foreign lands than any
other source of advertisement she has
invested in, and many favorable com
ments have been made on our state's
prosperity."

Athens, Sept., 25. Thirty thousand
insurgents now control the Island of
Crete, following the occupation of
Canea and Heraclion. Only eleven of
King Constantir.e's Cretan body
guard remained loyal, the rest sur
rendering to the insurgents without a
struggle.
The capture of Canea. capital of
Crete, was accomplished without
bloodshed according to advices re
ceived here. A force of several thou
sand insurgents surrounded the city
and the soldiers in the garrison with
few exceptions joined the revolution
ists. Canea fell a few hours after the
capture of Kandia.
The Greok authorities have turned
all government buildings over to the
leaders of the separatist movement.

Halt Teutonic Invasion.
Rome, Sept. 25. Reinforced by
Russian detachments the Rumanians
have halted the attempted Teutonic
invasion on their northwestern fron
tier and have taken the offensive at

reported as far west as Orsova. In
Dobrudja, the battle is growing less
violent but the Rumanians retain the
initiative.
The allies have suffered, a reverse
in the fighting east of the'Vardar in

pressing forward. A fierce battle is
going on south of Kenali, where the
Serbians are attacking strong systems
of Bulgarian defenses, barring the way
to Monastir.

Tivo More Arrests In Blackmail
Syndicate Case.
Under Fake Arrest, Couples
Brought From T. Y.
Chicago, Sept. 25. Two more ar
rests on sensational charges in connec
tion with the nation-wide blackmail
syndicate, served today to turn atten
tion from the local political fight
which the case threatens to develop
into here.
Homer T. French, who was seized
yesterday, charged with posing as a
secret service agent to force $15,000
in hush money from a couple brought
here some time ago from New York,
supposedly by French and accom
plices, and today any connection
with the case. He said Hinton G.
Clabaugh, federal investigator, has
known all along where he has been.
James Christian was rearrested with
French, but was later released on
$10,000 bond. They are accused by
Clabaugh of assisting in the plot
whereby A. R. Wesley and Alice Wil
liams, whose addresses are withheld
by CJabaugh, were brought to Chi
cago from New York, put thru a
mock trial before a fake federal com
missioner and allowed to go by paying
$15,000.
Two others, George Irwin and "Doc"
Brady, are named by Clabaugh as
supposed participants. Irwin was ar
rested with French here in June, but
is a fugitive from justice. French has
been on parole to Clabaugh since
then. French and Christian, it is said,
will be taken to New York for trial.

This City's Death List as Great
as Kansas City's.
New York, Sept. 25. More people
have been killed and injured by auto
mobiles on the 3treets of American
cities during this year, than in all the
Zeppelin raids on England. Chicago
and New York lead in the number of
deaths, with more than 200 each be
tween January 1 and September I.
The number of fatalities in other
large cities is proportionately high.
These figures, compiled today, on
reports from a score of cities, are
based upon police records, which
show a constantly growing death list
as a result of automobile accidents. In
New York and other states even more
drastic legislation is being urged.
In the cities from which reports
were available today, figures up to
September 1 show that a total of 1,
040 persons have been killed and
more than 8,000 injured. Only par
tial lists of injured were received and
it is possible that the complete toll
would show almost double this num
ber. Zeps Killed 368 in Two Years.
In Zeppelin raids on England to
date about 368 have been killed and
870 wounded in two years. Police re
ports show 158 persons killed ;.nd
4,484 injured on the streets of New
York up to September 1. The New
York State Automobile association es
timates show 226 killed, however, for
New York city.
Chicago records show 205 killed,
while Philadelphia reports 88.
In Detroit 63 were killed and 2,71a
injured up to September 1-
Los Angeles reports 75 killed and
Columbus, Ohio, 40.
In many cities heavy penalties are
being inflicted for driving a car while
intoxicated and other remedial meas
ures are being considered.
Police Commissioner Woods has
urged drastic legislation for this state.
The next legislature will again be
asked to pass a law compelling every
operator of an automobile to obtain a
license. At present only chauffeurs
are required to do this.
New York and Chicago have spe
cial traffic courts, which handle only
violation of traffic rules.
City Reports on Fatalities.
Practically all cities now have strict
traffic rules, "safety zones" for per
sons boarding street cars, and speed
laws The traffic systems are largely
modeled after that introduced in New
York but improvements are constant
ly being sought. Reports of fatalities
and injuries in cities other than those
already mentioned follow:
St. Louis, 37 killed.
Cleveland, 30.
State of Iowa, 30 killed and 400
injured.
Des Moines. 15 killed.
Denver, 26 killed, 524 injured.
Milwaukee, 21 killed.
Washington, 19 killed.
San Francisco, Portland and Seattle,

Sheriff Carroll Was Reinstated
by Governor Today.
CITIZENS ARE BEHIND HIM
Executive Is Convinced Official
Did His Duty.
Effort! to Uncover Evidence on
Lynchers' Identity.
Governor Capper today reinstated
E. G. Carroll as sheriff of Johnson
county. Evidence before the governor
showed that Carroll had exhausted
every effort to block mob violence in
the lynching of Burt Dudley and has
acted in good faith in his investiga
tions. With the restoration of Carroll
to office, it was announced that state
departments would go into the John
son county probe.
Carroll came to Topeka todav to
present his case to Governor Capper
and S. M. Brewster, attorney general.
Hollowing a lengthy conference Gov
ernor Capper announced that Carroll
would be reappointed. He also an
nounced that S. M. Brewster, attornev
general, would either go to Olathe
personally or send an- assistant attor
ney general to the investigation which
begins October 5.
Many letters, telegrams and tele
phone communications were received
by Governor Capper relative to the
reinstatement of Sheriff Carroll, who
automatically stepped out of office
wnen .Dudley was lynched. In prac
tically every instance Johnson county
citizens urged Carroll's reappointment.
A personal investigation by the gover
nor showed that the sheriff had acted
in good faith.
Capper Is Convinced.
"I am convinced that Sheriff Carroll
used every method and means at hi
command in an effort to prevent mob
violence," said Governor Capper. "The
case has been thoroughly investigated
and the eviaence, as well a the Judg
ment of leading citizens of Johnson
county, . indicate clearly that Carroll
should be appointed. He has assured
me that he will go ahead with the
investigation and will seek the arrest
of the men who" participated in the
hanging. The state will also take a
hand in the case. Either General
Brewster or one of his assistants will
go to Olathe October 5 for the in
vestigation and will help to uncover
any new evidence."
Sheriff Carroll is a Democrat. He
has made an excellent record during
his present term. Because of his
popularity, the Republicans did not
nominate-a man against him. His re
appointment today means he will
service the balance of his present term
and will succeed himself to office
without a contest. Carroll spent sev
