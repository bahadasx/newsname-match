TIDE FLOWS
TO SIDE OF
WILSON
Postmaster Barefoot Tells of Several Cases
cf Switching ot Lifelong
Republicans .
Expressing satisfaction with his po
litical observations while on his recent
trip to his old home in Arkansas, Post
master G. W. Barefoot returned yes
terday morning from a week's visit
more confident than ever in tho com
ing success of the Democratic ticket.
A most unusual cvoluation presented
itself in the political views of the rela
tives whom he visited which convinced
him that many other Republicans will
cast aside their party chief and vote
for President Wilson in November.
Mr. Barefoot left Washington coun
ty, Ark., In lie had seven uncles
who raised families'5 in that county.
During the civil war Confederate bush
whackers shot and killed one of the
uncles and the entire family shifted to
the federal cause, all of the men fight
ing in the federal army. Since that
time without a. single exception they
have voted tho Republican ticket,
though having been reared and rais
ing families in a Democratic state. For
the first time since the war this con
dition has changed. A cousin, now 63
years old anti a son of the man who
was killed by the bushwhackers, told
the Chickasha postmaster that every
man in the Barefoot family this year
without exception would vote for
Woodrow Wilson. Later, while on a
trip through the county, this cousin
pointed to tho immense apple orchards
and crops which lined the roads and
explained. Vl.s county subsists on its
u.-iB'und strawberry crops. "Without
the apple crop we would bo ruined.
President Wilson settled the strike for
the American people. Do you know
what that strike would have meant to
us? All tho trees which you have
seen have borne heavily. What would
have happened in case of a strike?
The entire crop would have rotted in
the lanes and every merchant and far
mer In this part of the country would
havo gone bankrupt. That crop
stands above everything else for the
prosperity of this community."
Another convert to the Democratic
ticket was found in a lifelong Repub
lican who for seven years had been
postmaster under Republican rule.
When Hughes was declared to be the
nominee of the Republican party this
man was enthusiastically In favor of
him as he has been in the case of all
other Republican nominees, and had
intended to vote for the former chief
justice. But Hughes had not measur
ed up to the standard which had been
set for him by his followers. In other
words, In the opinion of this and oth
er Republicans of Arkansas Hughes
has been a failure as a campaigner and
these Republicans will vote for Wil
son, MARRIED TEN YEARS:
HAVE NINETEEN SONS
Corning, Ark., Sept. 23. Frank
Scott and his wife of Kensett have
been married ten years. Nineteen
boys have been born to them. Six
died at birth. Of the thirteen living
there are three sets of triplets and
two sets of twins. The parents have

OPEN THEIR
CAMPAIGN
Pittsburg Spellbinder Asserts Great War
and Not Democratic Principles Cre

CRITICIZES WILSON
AND ADAMSON BILL
Says Underwood Bill Threw Country on
Falling Market Bu Big War
Came to Rescue
Introduced by Eugene Hamilton, who;
declared that the American rhur hint
been . in disrepute and that American
citizens had been murdered without,
provoking more than a note of protest
during the Wilson administration, Col.
A. C. Rankin, of Pittsburg, speaking
tinder the auspices of the Republican
National committee, opened the G. O.
P. campaign In Crady county with an
address at the corner of Third and
Chickasha avenuti Saturday afternoon.
Incidentally it was also Col. Rankin's
first speech in the state, where he lias
been sent to make a tour In behalf of
Hughes and Fairbanks.
In opening his address Col. Jtankins
said he was a Republican from prin
ciple but he bad ,iq quacrel with men
who honestly held different views. "I
think you Democrats down here are
simply mistaken," 'said he In a good
humor, "and 1 have come to try to en
lighten you."
Continuing his address the speaker
said, "Tho Democrats in this i,:i
paign are trying to malce. pontics out
of non-partisan questions.' The bank
reserve act, for example, was a non
partisan measure. It doew not embody
the doctrine of the Democratic party
but Is based upon principles worked
out by the Republican party. Mexico
and Europe are not partisan issues.
Does anybody believe Tatt or Roose
velt could not have handled these Is
sues 11s well as Wilson? In these mat
ters it is a question of efficiency. If
Hughes had been president he would
have prevented the trouble we are hav
ing with Mxlco." 1
Regarding tho Adamson bill, Col.
Ilanklns was severe in his criticism
of the administration. "Wilson said
this trouble hnd been brewing for
year. Then why didn't he take steps
to stop it before the crisis came?
Hughes would have settled the contro
versy without going to congress. The
eight-hour dr., j: not practicable on
railroads. The question involved in
the Adamson act is one of wages.
This law is unconstitutional and the
railroads will fiht it in the courts.
It Is class legislation and will not
stand,
"Hughes secured the passage pr
more labor legislation while he, was
governor of New York than was ever
enacted In a similar time -in any other
state. Among these emasures was a
child labor law and the law J tin Rings
the hours of trainmen. Hug" s niinds
for efficiency.
"Wilson w rites nf fl articles Rut he
never sticks to anything he says. His
administration and his cabinet ara the
weakest we have ever had."
The speaker asserted that the Dem
ocratic party count lay no claim wha'.-
ever to any degree ot creult tor pres
ent American prosperity. The Amer
ican people are osperous In spite ot
and not because of the Wilson admin
istration. The overwhelming volume
of business brought on by the great
Kuropeau war, lie said, had come to
the rescce of the present administra
tion at a time when tho fallacy of the
Underwood bill enacted in 1913 was
about to be shown to the chagrin of
the advocates of a low tariff. "During
the eight months in which the- bill
was in operation before the outbreak
of the European conflict the balance
of trade was against the United States
in the sum of $220.000. Onii. What
would have happened to this country
hud not the war broken out? Who
can estimate the amount of gold whit h
would have been taken across the At
