The board of regents of the
Oregon Normal schools filed Its
final draft of a survey made of
public Instruction ThursdaJ
afternoon and tn the report ap
the normal school conditions to
the state superintendent or
pears a paragraph In which the
necessity of providing addition
al normal schools In the state Is
pointed out
"It is apparent to anyone
who has studied the situation
that there Is need for additional
normal school racllltles in Ore
gon," says the report. "The
Monmouth school alone cannot
care for the number of students
who desire to be or who should
be enrolled In normal Bchoola
within the next two or three
years and It will be necessary to
send Oregon students to Wash
ington and California for train
ing a practice which Is not
only economically disadvanta
geous to the state but highly
disadvantageous from the
staudpoint of professional and
school spirit throughout the
state."

HAPPY CANYON AGAIN
MAKES BIG. SUCCESS
RecetptM for Last Three Kvralngs
Will Go a Lorn? Way Toward Iay.
liur for New l'avillon.
The third annual Happy , Canyon
was a big success, both as an enter
tanlment for the Hound-Up crowds
during the evening and a self-suport-Ing
Institution.
During the last three evenings the
new pavilion was crowded to capacity!
and the receipts from seat and buck !
sal was very satisfactory. Wiii
surplus of the past two years, the In
come this year will go a long way to
ward paying for the new pavilion as
well as the expenses of the entertain
ment. There wili probably be a de
ficit, of several thousand dollars but
the directors believe this will be wip
ed out in another year.
The show from an entertainment
standpoint made a big hit with home
people and visitors and many hun
dreds were turned away during the
last two nigh'.e. Considering the han
dicap the committee was under this
year, their undertaking was a huge
success.
The attendance Saturday night was
the largest of the four nights and
would have been much larger had
there been more room for accommo
daUon. And yet, so great was the
crowd In town that the 6000 or 6000
at Happy Canyon was not missed from
the streets. Other amusement places
were crowded and still there was a
surging crowd making its noisy way
up and down the street until past
midnight.
The special trains began leaving at
10:45 and by midnlgnt several thou
sand had departed for their homes.
The La Grande and Journal specials
left at 11 o'clock with ringing cheers
for Pendleton and the Round-Up and
the Walla Walla people who left at
10:45 were hardly le-s enthusiastic.
ASHBAUGH CASE IS
BEFORE THE JURY
When the circuit court reconvened
this morning the case of L. B. Ash
baugh vs. the O-W. R. & N. Co.,
growing out of the death of Mrs.
Ashhaugh in December, 1914, was
brought up for a Jury trial. Mr. Ash
baugh is suing for $7500 damages for
the death of his wife which, he alleges
was caused by the negligence and
carelessness of the company.
Mrs. Ashbaugh was run over by a
train when she attempted to crawl
under it. The train blocked Main
street of Kcho and she wished to get
to the depot. The train started just
as she was crawling under.
The selecting of the jurymen and
the stating of the case took up the
morning and this afternoon the tak
ing of testimony began. Miss KIna
Thomson, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. j
Asa R. Thomson, was one of the first
w itnesses and testified that she had j
crawled under the train before It ran
over Mrs. Ashhaugh.
Judge James A. Fee and Col. J. H.
Haley are attorneys for the plaintiff

Jackson Sundv, jw world's
champion bronch uster, will
quit riding bucking horses. He
stated this morning that he will
never enter another bucking
contest.
Sundown, who Is past fifty,
Is pretty sore today for the se
vere shaking Angel gave him
and he Is suffering from a cold.
He figures he Is too old to stay
in the game but he intends to
train other Indians for the con
tests. He has some bucking
stock at his home in Maho and
will teach some of the young
Indians how to ride.
An interesting sidelight upon
the Indian champion's charac
ter was furnished this morning
when he went to Hamley &
Co.'s store to claim the $350
prize saddle. When asked
what inscription he wanted on
the silver plate, he asked that
hia wife's name be engraved
on It. It was explained that the
name of the winner must be
placed on it.
The Round-Up this afternoon
had a picture taken of Sundown
In his prize saddle and wearing
the gold belt he won as all
around champion.
To Enforce Federal I .aw.
E. S. Cattron, federal Inspector of
the. migratory bird law. has been In
Pendleton for the past few days en
route to Portland from Idaho. He
states that the federal law relative
to the shooting of migratory birds will
be strictly enforced, and Deputy State
Warden Tonkin states that he and hie
deputies will co-operate with the fed
eral authorities. The federal law
opens the season on geese and ducks
Oct. 1 and closes it at sunset, Janu
ary 15. It also prohibits the shoot
ing of geese and ducks before sunrise
or after sunset.

WILSON PREDICTS
HIGHEST PLACEFOR
U. S. IN BUSINESS
LYRIC THEATER, Baltimore,
Sept. 25. President Wilson addressed
the National Grain Dealers' Associa
tion and urged a new spirit In Ameri
can business. He recommended a
competition of brains, not selfishness.
Three thousand loudly cheered the
prediction that America waa destined
to occupy the highest place in the
business world.
"We are facing a new business era.
American business has burst its jack
et and it now develops that the Amer
ican business man is unstudied in the
foreign market
"We have no merchant marine.
Our national banks don't handle for
eign exchange. Amenica alwas Is
disinclined to touch the nerves of for
eign business and not until the for
eign reserve act was passed could
American banks assist American pro
Jects in all parts of the world. Amer
ica must step into the new field. My
dream is she'll take ner place in that
new field with a spirit the world nev
er saw before. I want to see Ameri
can brains pitted against the world."
Cries of "We want Wilson," greeted
the president upon entering the the
theater. He seemed highly pleased.
A great crowd outside was unable to
gain admittance.
Jackson Sundown, 50 year old Nei
Perce Indian of Culdesac, Idaho, is
the new champion broncho buster of
the world. He Is the first Indian ever
to wrest the title rrom the paleface
cowboys.
Saturday afternoon before the
largest single-day crowd that has ev
er gathered for Pendleton's annual
frontier show the Indian, who has
been a contestant tn five Round-Up
bucking contests, won the highest
honor that a buckaroo can gain and
the verdict of the judges was the
most popular one with the crowd
since the Round-Up began.
Sundown qualified for the semi-finals
by riding Casey Jones, the hard
bucking little buckskin, and in the
semi-finals Saturday he rode Wig
gles, the sunfU-hing twister, in a most
sensational style. This ride popular
ized him witji the crowd and it put
him in the finals. Of the fourteen
riders entered in the semi-finals. Sun
down, Rufus Rollen of Claremore,
Okla., and Broncho Bob Hall of Po
catello, Idaho, were cnosen to ride fh
the finals for the cnampionship.
They drew for the three mount
saved for the finals. Long Tom, Angel
and Speedball. Sundown drew Angel,
(the big bay that
made Lou Minor
champion in 1912, Rollen drew the re
doubable Old Long Tom and Hall
drew the lean, black plunger that has
been in many a final contest.
Sundown was first to ride Angel

made a series of high, long; Jumps

Hall was master of him from the

Rollen, who was fresh from win'
