JOHN CROUPA IS
HELDFORHUGGING
SCHOOL TEACHER
AT WILTON HOME
Sheriff Gunderson Requests Chief to
Hold Him Fending an
Investigation.
HOMESTEADERS TAKE
OATH OP VENGEANCE
Miss Olga Dahl Continues to Improve
Search for Assailant
Continues.
John Croupa, well known around
Bemidji because of his peculiar ac
tions, was arrested this morning for
attempting to hug a school teacher
at Wilton. He" is also held as a sus
pect in the assault upon Miss Olga
Dahl, Round Lake school teacher.
Croupa, it is alleged, arrived at
"Wilton last evening on the freight
train and went to the Rue hotel. At
the hotel he made overtures to sev
eral of the girls and attempted to hug
one of the school teachers. The girls
became frightened and went to their
rooms.
Attemnts to Follow.
This morning he attempted to fol
low one of the teachers to her school.
The school teacher became frightened
and several boys and young men es
cort her to the school.
i The feeling in Wilton against
Croupa became tense and he was
placed tinder* arrest and spirited to
this city.
Croupa very closely resembles the
man who is accused of assaulting Olga
Dahl, Round Lake school teacher,
who walked the little teacher into
the woods at the point of a revolver,
trussed her to a sapling, attacked her
after a night of torture and shot her
twicer in the head.
Can't White Endish.
Croupa, however, was dressed dif
ferently and he does not speak or
write English.
He has been arrested in Bemidji
several times because of his actions.
Last spring he attempted to get into
a girl's room in a local hotel by dig
ging a hole through the wall He
was arrested and examined for his
sanity. He was released, ordered out
of town and up to yesterday had not
been seen in this district.
He stated that he had been at
Crookston and maintains that he
knows nothing of the Dahl assault.
Sheriff Gunderson wired Chief of
Police Ripple this afternoon to hold
Croupa until further investigation.
Deputy Sheriff Riley of Itasca
county will arrive in the city tonight
to examine Croupa.
Search Continues.
In the meantime the search con
tinues in Itasca county for the assail
ant. Five hundred men were on a
man hunt yesterday. It is estimated
that 300 are still on the hunt today.
Several homesteaders, foreigners,
living near the scene of the crime,
have taken a~blood oath of vengeance
not to abandon the search until Miss
Dahl has recovered or until the as
sailant has been captured.
Saturday night a trace of the man
was reported found south of Round
Lake. A posse started on a search
but up to a late hour this afternoon
had been unable to locate the man.
Twenty new deputy sheriffs were
sworn in at Grand Rapids yesterday.
Resting Easier.
Miss Dahl is reported to be resting
easier and will recover. She is con
scious at times and tells* of meeting
the stranger. She maintains that it
was the man that had breakfast at
the Lumien home.
"Everybody is up in arms in the
district," said Sheriff Gunderson yes
terday. "I am afraid that if they
get hold of the man they will string
him up before the authorities have a
chance."
Another clue was located today
when it was reported that a man by
the same description was in Ten
strike several weeks ago. He was
posing as an evangelist and wanted
to establish himself in Tenstrike. He
had a failing,for girls and at various
times mentioned pretty girls. He
was ordered out and went to Nakoda.
Later he went to Mizpah. He has
since disappeared. He may have been
the same man that asked the way of
Constable Jones of Northome to the
Round Lake school house Tuesday,
the day before the crime was com
mitted.
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Naugle, Mrs.
J. W. Naugle and Archie Naugle will
leave tomorrow on a motor trip to
Norway, Mich.
