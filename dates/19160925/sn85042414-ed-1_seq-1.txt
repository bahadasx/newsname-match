GERMANY MUST
BEDEEENDED
Socialists of Country Con
demn War for Con
quest.
London, Sept. 25.—A conference of
the socialists of the German empire
has adopted by a vote of 251 to 5 a
resolution declaring the country must
be defended until its en'emles are pre
pared to conclude a peace guarantee
ing the political and territorial in
tegrity and the economic development
of Germany, according to a telegram
from Berlin received at Amsterdam
and forwarded by the Reuter Tele
gram company.
The resolution is said to have
strongly condemned the machinations
and demands of those who wish to
make the war one of conquest. This
attitude, it is contended, strengthens
the resistance of Germany's opponents
and tends to prolong the cpnfiict.
The conference expressed its regret
that the efforts of the socialists for
peace had not met the desired re
sponse from countries enemy to Ger
many, as not only had enemy states
men, but even the official representa
tives of French socialism and of the
English labor party declared them
selves hostile to peace. It was de
manded that the German government
should continually endeavor to ter
minate the war and give the people
the peace they have long desired.'
Approval of the action of the social
ists In the relchstag in voting for Ger
many's war credits was expressed by
the conference.

London, Sept. 25.—Of the twelve
big Zeppelins which invaded the Brit
ish Isles Saturday night to deal death
and destruction from the skies, two
yesterday lay stark and blackmasses
or steel and aluminum in the little
village of Mangold, Essex county.
They fell victims of the anti-air craft
defenses of London and outlying dis
tricts.
P°e came down a flaming torch as
did the Zeppelin L-21 destroyed three
weeks ago while the second disabled
by gun fire affected a landing, which
saved the lives of the crew who to
day are prisoners in England. The
crew of the first raider died In the
consuming flames of their own ship.
This latest raider to light her own
funeral way on English soil collapsed
and was consumed much more quick
ly than the L-21. It is possible,
though, that some of the men were
still living when the great vessel
struck the ground. The captain's
body was found some distance frojw
the wreck.
The death and burning of the first
Zeppelin was witnessed by tens of
tnousand of London residents, but the
wounding and descent of the second
raider, was a matter of doubt until
yesterday's official statements were
given out. Few details are available
or the second raiders condition but It
is reliably reported that the crew sur
rendered to special constables.

One Machine
Many who saw the shrapnel burst

have been several direct hits. Many
aeroplanes were aloft and attacked
the Zeppelins from all sides.
The raiders took a heavy toll of
lives before their destruction, 28 per
sons being killed and 99 wounded in
the Metropolitan district of London.
Two persons were killed, probably
four, and seventeen were wounded in
the provinces.
The property damage while widely
distributed Is confined for the most
part to small suburban dwellings and
shops, although one railway station
was damaged, some empty cars being
destroyed and part of the tracks torn
up.
The roar of dropping bombs was
heard In many districts where the
raiders were Invisible. It Is not be
lieved that more than two or three
Invading Zeppelins which crossed the
east coast succeeded in reaching the
environs of London, and that two of
these paid the death penalty gives the
greatest satisfaction to the military
authorities. Apart from the loss in

Capitalist Nominees,
Says Allan G. Benson
New York. Sept 25.—President
Wilson and Charles E. Hughes were
characterized as "candidates of the
capitalists" by Allen L. Benson,
nominee of the Socialist party for
president at a meeting held In Madi
son Square Garden.
Mr. Benson and his running mate,
George R. Kirkpatrlck as well as
other Socialist nominees were ap
plauded by a large crowd which as
sembled for the formal ratification of
the party's candidates.
Mr. Benson attacked both the
Democratic and Republican parties
for "favoring militarism." He de
clared that had the Socialist party
been in power during the last four
years "it would have seized the in
dustries of this country and operated
them for the benefit of the public."
"It would not have permitted this
country," he added, "to Increase its
wealth by forty one billion dollars un
less the workers had their full share
in it. It would not have permitted
$600,000,000 worth of food to go out
of the country and thus make the
cost of living higher. Nor would it
have passed a draft law."
