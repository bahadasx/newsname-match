PROBED WIFE'S
MURDER
NOW
IS HELD FOR IT
County Prosecutor in Missouri
Chief Actor in Strange Do
mestic Tragedy.
BEATEN TO DEATH IN HOME
Attorney Then Is Alleged to
Have Fired Shots and Told
Story of Assault.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Sept. K.-After
having conducted an extended Investi
gation Into tho murder of his wife tn
his capacity a county prosecutor, Oscar
McDanlols Is held here today charged
with having killed her himself. One of
, v , the most gripping stories of tragedy In
tne nisiory or Missouri is .promised
when the details of Mrs, McDanlels'
death are unfolded.
Special Prosecutor Bart Lockwood
asked thai a special grand Jury bo
called to hear tho chargo of murder
placed against McDanlels when the fall
term of criminal court opened today.
Lockwood will ask for an Indictment,
alleging that Mrs. McDanlels had
threatened divorce, and was slain by
her husband after a quarrel.
Tho nttorney, who Is now carrying
on tho work which McDanlels himself
handled, alleged that the defendant had
said ho was going to a lodge meeting
on the Eight of July 14. Ho whs not
there, howver, and upon returning
home about 10 o'clock was reproached
by his wifo.
Beat Her To Death, Is Charged.
Tho latter threatened public exposure,
and a quarrel followed. It ended by
McDanlels beating his wife to death,
Lockwood charges. McDanlels had de
clared that he was lured from his home
by a fake telephone call on the night
of the shooting, and upon returning
found his wife dead. The present prose
cutor declares, however, that this call
was of his predecessor's own Invention,
plannod to divert suspicion.
The entire series of charm, and th
atory told by MtDanlrlsi ivHds llko a
pago torn from a melodrama. McDan
lels declared that upon returning home
after answering tlio telephone call, he
was fired upon as he stepped from his
. automobile. He crouched behind the
car and returned the fire. He was car
lying a revolver, he said, because
threats had been made against his life.
Kscaplng unwounded he ran Into the
house, whore he found his wife dying.
In an adjoining room the McDanlels
children were sleeping undisturbed.
Says He "Set the Stage."
Lockwood will charge that McDanlels
left the house after killing his wife,
nnd fired all of the shots which were
heard br the neighbors, and which
the prosecutor declared were directed at
him by his assailants.
McDanlels took his arrest lightly,
laughed when the officers came for him,
and with a cheery "All right." walked
two miles to prison.
Tho prosecutor had charged that per
sons he had prosecuted for violations of
the law were responsible for the killing
of his wife and the alleged attack upon
him.
Ho took the part a prosecutor ordlnar
v would play In the Investigation, and
the probe wan pressed through hearings
before the coroner for several weeks.
A reward was offered for the arrest of
the murderers, but all persons question
ed in rcgara w tno crime later were re
leased. -?

HUGHESlPENS UP
Outdoor Speeches in Dayton
Forbidden by His Wife and
Physician.
By PERRY ARNOLD.' '
DAYTON, Ohio, Sept. 28. Republican
Nominee Hughes brought his policies
Into the Buckeye State today, beginning
a three-day oratorical marathon.
Becauie Hughes' throat is still In
flamed and his vocal cords frayed by
his long-distance speaking In Indiana,
Mrs. Hughes and the nominee's physi
cian, Dr. L. D. Alexander, Jr., forbade
any out of door speech In Dayton.
Local committees, therefore, made up
for lack of spoech from the candldato
by a program which sought to show
him off to the populace from morn till
night.
Hughes arrived at Dayton shortly be
fore o'clock, and was met by a large
reception committee, headed by J. J.
Nevln. Later In the day Gov. Frank
U. Willis, of Ohio, was due to Join the
"nomination special" and travel with
the party during Hughes' stumping In
unio.
Visitn Old Soldiers.
First of all today the candidate waa
whisked off 'to the Boldlers' Home. At
11:30 ho was to make a speech before
the League of Republican Clubs. This
afternon he was due to put In an ap
pearance and review a parade at the
mate rair grounds ana tonight to de
liver his big speech of the oVv at the
city auillriifu ,
In between times, he expected to con
fer with Ohio Republicans on the politi
cal outlook ex-Qov. Myron T. Herrlck
and Ralph Cole among the number.
HUgnea Begins the second week of his
second campaign tour In splendid phy
sical shape, but very much bothered as
to voice. The superhuman efforts at
stumping he made In Indiana have left
his voice In such shape that It Is an
obvious effort for htm to talk. He is told
at all "times he must conserve his voice
and that slows him up Just a trifle In
his delivery as well as it forces htm to
speak In a harsh monotone. Fresh from
three days or constant ovations in In
diana and met here today with a big
enthusiastic crowd, he was literally
bubbling with enthusiasm and energy
or at least as nearly bubbling with en
thusiasm and energy as a former Su
preme Court Justice can be.
Tariff Is Main Theme.
Hughes plans to make the tariff and
Americanism his main themes In Ohio
speeches during the next few days.
The specter of closed factories after
the end of .the European war if the
Democratic principle of a tariff for
revenue only 1 continued, which the
nominee so strongly invokes, made a
big hit in Indiana, and the candidate
Is of the opinion it will be an equally
potent campaign argument here In
Ohio.

MYSTERY OVER
RIVER VICTIM
IS NOT- SOLVED
Mark Qn Shoes Leads to Be
lief She Came From Chi
cago. FOUL PLAY NOT SHOWN
Boatmen Do Not Believe She
Could Have Jumped Over
board" From Steamer.
Despite determined efforts by the
District police and Virginia authori
ties, the identity of the body of the
woman found in the Potomac off ML
Vernon last night is still enshrouded
in mystery.
With a mark in her shoes. "Marshall
Field, TB," the only tangible clue, of
ficials are hoping to find a solution of
the mystery through this or through
photographs of tho woman taken to
day, which will bo sent broadcast
throughout the country.
Police pictures of the woman were
taken today at Wheatleys undertaking
parlor In Alexandria, where the body
was taken last night after Its dlscov
ery by J. H. Davis, an employe at Mt.
Vemon.
The mark on the shoe leads the police
to believe that the 'woman was a resi
dent of, or had recently come from.
Chicago, where Marshall Field's storo
Is located. The shoes seemed to be
nearly new. The Chicago police have
been notified of the death, and have
been given a description of the body,
and will co-operate with the local au
thorities In an attempt to find the
relatives of the woman.
None Missing Answer Description.
The body does not correspond to the
description of any person known to bb
missing in the District, according to the
police. County officials in Maryland
and Virginia have not been furnished
with any descriptions of missing per
sons, in any way similar to that of the
drowned woman. .
Although the, police offlclaj hero re
J'tl(r to l.tolio puullc any incur z th.it
they are working on. It Is known that
they have not considered foul play as
a great possibility. There were no
marks on the woman's body to indicate
violence.
The two most likely theories of the
woman's death appear to officials to bo
suicide and accldenttal drowning by
falling from a river boat. The latter
Idea is discounted, because crowds on
the excursion steamers at this time of
year la not as large as during the hot
days of summer, and tho absence of
anyone would be likely to be noticed.
No Passengers Reported Lost.
The regular steamers, which ply be
tween Washington and down river
points, usually carry only such passen
gers as are noted on the berth lists.
Boatmen point out that no river boat
goes near the cove in which the body
was found, and they said that had she
gone overboard further out, the body
could not havo been washed In so soon.
The condition of the body Indicates
that it waa not in the water more than
eighteen hours.
In support of the suicide theory It Is
pointed out that the woman might
easily have leaped into the river from
the sea wall at Mt. Vernon without
being deteoted or her absence noted.
She was evidently about forty-five
years old, with Iron-gray hair. Her
features are regular, Inclined to be
aquiline. She wore a neat blue serge
suit, and black low shoes.
Magistrate Harry Whlto will hold an
Inquest over the body today.
Rehearse Kisses
To Convince Judge
Procedure Is Part of Woman's
Appeal From Divorce
Decision.
BOSTON, Mass., Sept 22. The three
minute embraces and stolen kisses,
which played an Important part In the
divorce which Major Ralph a. Car
penter, of Wolfeboro, N. H., and Bos
ton, won from Mrs. Marguerite P. Car
penter, were rehearsed at Magnolia last
night before Judge Klvel, who heard
the case In Concord, N, H.
The rehearsal was part of Mrs. Car
penter's appeal from the judge's de
cision. Through her counsel she has
denied that she sat In a man's lap on
the plaxza of the Gables Cottage, as de
tectives testified, or allowed herself to
be kissed.
She claimed It would have been Im
possible for detectives to have stood
where they said they did and havo seen
anything on tho piazza. At the request
of Mrs. Carpenter's counsel, Judge
Klvel went to Magnolia and stood where
the detectives said they stood and watch

D. C MOTOR FATALITIES FEW
"Washington b one of the few big cities of the country which, in the face of heavily Increas
ing automobile traffic, has kept its casualties practically at the tame figures.
"In the fiscal year of 1914 there were 18 deaths from automobile accidents, 16 in 191S, and
19 in the. fiscal year ended June 30, 1916.
"This year's serious casualties show a marked falling off over the last year. In 1915 there were
51 serious casualties, this year there were 26, while in 1914 there were 26."
