FOR PIUS
mi ENCOURAGED
Mayor Must Make Them
Obey the Law As It
Stands.
At the regular Monday morning
meeting ot the City Board of Affairs
today, an ordinance that cast it's shadow
before, in which the Mayor asked
for a change in the city laws, said
licange to allow the erection of the
Wilson club sign as well as other's
sign on certain occasions,was practically
turned down. It was placed
on record as having been read once
and will be reread next Monday and
tho following Monday, but this was
simply done at the request of the mayor
to show those who have been pesteroing
him that he is working tooth
and toe nail for the sign.
As soon as the ordinance was read
by City Clerk em, it was decided that
the entirde matter be left in the mayor's
hands and it becamo known that
there was not much love for signs
on the streets. The mayor asked that
an ordinance permitting signs to be
erected on all gala occasions such
as football games, baseball games,
pink teas, circuses, etc., be passed.
Fearing that it wniilf! ho th. Hnath
knell of the ordinance to allow this, i
I the commissioners refused to hear It. i
The mayor said that he wanted, to get <
the blame off his shoulders a's both ]
sides, Democratic and Republican, <
which are full of "onery politicians" l
were going after him on both flanks, t
Judlng by the amount of enthusiasm
which registered zero?minus, whea I
the ordinance was read there is not i
the least likelihood that any signs i
will ever be erected In the city with t
the approval of the city government. 1
The Republican headquarters asked
for a permit to erect an electric sign
or the Hall Block, said sign not to .
extend over the sidewalk more than
the legal distance khlch Is four feet.
The matter was placed In the mayor's
hands for action. He was told that
the Republicans had their search light
up Saturday night, before having been
granted a license to do so. "I'll fine
them," shouted the mayor, "for violating
the law." Although In all earnestness
at first, he smiled blandly

MOVEMENT TO 1
Ministerial Union Asked to
Counties and Start I
Put Teeth
r
Yesterday's Yost law enforcement
mass meeting held at 3 o'clock In the
M. P. Temple resulted In two Important
steps.
A committee consisting of Harry
Shaw, R. A. Watts, Dr. C. O. Henry,
Robert Miller and Ray Holbert was appointed
to investigate the tho advisability
of bringing legal proceedings
against the proprietors of "bootlegging
centers, gambling Joints and
houses of ill fame.
The Ministerial Union was requested
to correspond with people In the
other other counties of the state and
take such other measures as may be
necessary to bring about an amendment
of the Yost law so that It will
provide greater restrictions against
bringing liquor Into the state and provide
heavier penalties against those
who break the law the first time.
The meeting was larger In point
of attendance than the one held on
the previous Sunday and, If possible,
thoso who attended It were more in
earnest. It was the Impression of
those present that the appointment
of the committee to assist the Mayor
and the Prosecuting Attorney means
that a thoroughgoing war of extermination
will be gin Immediately upon
bootlegging, gambling and vice In this
city.
In fact It already has begun, for
when Rev. J. C. Broomfleld toward the
end of the meeting announced that
he Intended during the present week
to go back to see what Is going on at
the Hull alley place about which he
complained at the previous meeting
Prosecuting Attorney Haggerty arose
and announced that the place was
safely closed up because the woman
who had been running It is In jail.
The announcement was greeted with
a round of applause.
The meeting got down to business
with praiseworthy dispatch. All present
were anxious that something constructive
be done. Rev. J. B. Workman,
president of the Ministerial Union,
against presided and prayer was
offered by Rev. C. E. Goodwin, pastor
of th eFlrst Methodist church.
Then a report of the committee on
resolutions was called for and J.
M. Black read the following:
Committee on Resolutions
To the mass meeting to be held
in the M. P. Temple, September 24, In
the interest of better enforcement of
the YoBt Prohibition Law, your Committee
on Resolutions begs leave to
submit the following:
Whereas, The concensus of opinion,
both public and private is: That there
is gross violation of the Yost Proi
btbltton Law In our midst, and
Whereas, We recognize It the duty
of our county and city officials to first
exhaust the law in suppressing said
violations of the law, and not cloud
the Issue or defer action by calling
upon the public, /
There, Be it Resolved:
First: That the Ministerial Association
of Fairmont be requested to
continue In charge of this general
; movement, and that all public meet
mga cuunecien inerowun ue neia under
Its direction.
Second: That this movement ol
Interested citizens create an Advisory
Committee, composed ot the following
men: Harry Shaw, R. A.
Watts, Dr. C. O. Henry, Robert Mil,
ler, and Ray Holbert, who shall cooperate
with Mayor Bowen and Prosecuting
Attorney Haggerty In the formation
and execution of whatever
plans they deem best for the suppression
of bottlegglng, and the better enforcement
of tbe Yost Law.
Third: That this Committee take
under advisement with the proper officials,
bringing of legal proceedings
against the places complained of as
bootlegging centers, gambling joints
and houses ot ill fame, with the view
of having them closed as public nuisances.
Fourth, That we further suggest
that in view of the fact that the
State's attorney has Informed the public
that the first violation of the Yost
Prohibition Law being a misdemeanor,
does not sufficiently deter the commission
of the first offense.
Therefore, be it further Resolved,
That It Is the sense of this meeting
that the Ministerial Association of
this city shall take such action, as
will reach every county in the state,
providing that all persons with the
temperance cause at heart, shall not
vote for, or against any candidate for
House of Delegates who does not
pledge his support to an amendment
to the Yost Prohibition Law, that will
make It a felony to sell anything that
contains more than one-halt of one
per cent, of alcohol, except on prescription
of a reputable physician.
.Fifth, That we pledge ourselves to

Your Committee, ^ -t
It was agreed upon the motlonfgJ '^Sj
Rev. Mr. Broomfleld that the rafolntions
be taken up separately fqr 00*- B
slderation. They were adopted
they stood until the third,''one was 1 v 'ja
reached. In the copy submitted by Jm
the committee bootlegging Centers S
alone were mentioned but upon the
motion of Rev. Mapson F. Hayllng,
pastor o( the colored Methodist church
this was broadened to Include gambling
joints and places of ill fame.
The fourth resolution was the sub' .
Ject of an interesting debate at the.:.
conclusion of which It was turnedV^Jjfl
over to Dr. C. O. Henry to be rewrii-.
ten so as to Include action to prevent'-^
bringing labeled goods into the state
with the sanction of the law. Dr. j
Henry started this discussion. WU'.iS/S
lian B. Ice, Jr., called attention,
the fact that the original Yost law dtt?^??
not contain the provision which maka ,?jpj
possible bringing labeled liquor' lnth j ^^B
the state. While the matter was tffida&|S
consideration Dr. L. N. Yost' spokeWjj
in favor of making the penalty fos^i'^3
first offenses against the prohibition- ;
law a felony. He said that in his ;
capacity of physician to the prisoners

carried a sentence to Moundsville they >.jm
would view It In a different light'
When the fifth resolution, the Olje fo-a
pledging support in every way to thS.!^ia
Ministerial Union and the advtsory^-^
committee, was presented for consideration
Rev. Mr. Broomfleld said thdt|$
be considered it the most ImportarUMSJ
of the series an dsuggested that it bis " '
adopted by a rising vote. The suggestion
was adopted and every ons. Sj
of the men and women In the large an- 7
dience stood up, most of them with the 1
light of resolution shining in. theif;^
eyes. At the conclusion of action on this
resolution the resolutions were,
adopted as a whole.
At the opening of the meeting.aaiv.^r
again before the close Chairman?*
Woitkman made brief addresses,
which he called attention to the pubfe?
pose of the movement and expressing
the hope that it would b esuccessfuL J
If further meetings of the cltizens.ani/Oa
needed they will be called by the?|ia>tjij
Isterial Union. Rev. Mr. Broomfleldifflj
1 speaking for the Ministerial DniqZ^v^l
said that the prospect that that boog>vd
would be called upon to take the mq^KSgl

cussed at a meeting held last. Mnai5Bj
