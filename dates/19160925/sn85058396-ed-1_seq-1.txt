1 injDeadlock From Danube to Sea I
Rumanians are Successful
in Transylvania-Capture
Guns and 7,000 Prisoners
Latest reports regarding the impor
tant campaign in the Rumanian prov-
ince of Dobrudja indicate a lessening
; in the intensity of the struggle be
tween the invading armies of the cen-
tral powers and the Russians and Ru
manians facing them.
'l- Field Marshal von Mackensen's ini-
Ual attempts to break the allied lines
formed to defend tho Constanza-Tcher-
naveda railroad evidently havo failed.
The opposing forces apparently are
now virtually deadlocked along the
front from the Danube to the Black
sea. The current statement from Bu
charest announces only artillery duels
along the Danube. It declares, how
ever, that the Rumanians have made
some progress on their left flank
which rests on the sea coast.
In their invasion of Transylvania,
the Rumanians report success in an at
tack at Hermannstadt, where 300 men
and five machine guns were captured.
Nearly 7,000 prisoners have been
taken by the Rumanians so far in
their Transylvanian campaign.
Today's official statement from Pet
it rograd, declaring no events of impor
tance have occurred along the Rus
sian or Caucasus fronts, is one of the
laconic sort customarily issued by the
war office when decisive results In
pending operations are lacking. It Is
probable, however, that adverse
weather conditions are playing an im
; portant part in shaping events, hanip
j ering the activities of the combatants
; In various fields,
i Official reports and private dis-
patches indicate that the fall rains
are Interfering with the progress of
; hostilities on virtually all the battle
fronts. In mountainous regions such
'. as the Alpine districts and the Cau
casus, cold weather and snow add to
! the difficulties of the combatants.

Baltimore, Md., Sept. 25. President
Wilson came to Baltimore today to
deliver the second speech of his cam
paign for re-election. He arrived here
at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon and was
driven immediately to the Lyric thea
ter for his address before the National
Grain Dealers' convention. Cheering
crowds of several thousand people
greeted him at the station.
The president's progress through
the streets was marked by a continu
ous ovation'. Four automobiles car
ried his Immediate party. There were
no bands because of Mr. Wilson's
Insistence that the occasion be kept
nonpartisan. Frequently, however, he
was forced to bow in response to ap
plause. A committee, representing
commercial organizations and the
Grain Dealers' association, met him.
As ho stepped upon the platform at
the theater the audience stood and
clapped.
By the time the president arrived
at the theater it was filled with nearly
3.000 neonle. Tt woe? flranorl with the

Mrs. Wilson accompanied the presi
dent and was warmly applauded. In
the audience were Senator Blair Lee
of Maryland and Joseph R. Wilson,
brother of the president.
The demonstration which marked
the president's arrival at the theater
lasted nearly five minutes. The peo
ple stood and cheered and waved
handkerchiefs. Several times Mr.
Wilson stood and bowed, while the
band played.
"We want Wilson" shouted one man.
President Wilson Introduced.
Leo G. Metcalf, head of the associa
tion, introduced Mr. Wilson with the
; simple words, "The President"
Mr. Wilson declared at the outset
that a political campaign seriously In
terfered with the consideration of pub
lic questions. He said ho desired his
audience to forget for the time being
that a campaign was on.
"What I have come to say," ho said,
"I want to say in an atmosphere of
calmness.
Business of World.
"T want to speak to you of 'the
business of the world from the stand
point of America."
He said that the export of grain from
the United States was decreasing in
ratio, adding that the agricultural
acreage of tho United States should
produce at least twice as much grain
as at present
"We have swung out into a new
business era," continued the president.
"Now our business has extended to
the whole world. Our trade has
burst its jacket Wo have realized
that American business men do not
have enough ships to carry thoir
goods."
U. S. Bank System.
The president speaking slowly,
turned to a discussion of tho banking
system of the United States. "Only
in very recent years," ho said, have
wo even studied the question. Not
until the present federal reserve act
was passed did American bankers
have proper facilities for carrying on
foreign business.
"Not only when this war Is over,
but now, America must take her stand
in American business on a scale she
has never known before.
Defends Administration Acts.
President Wilson upheld his tariff
policy, defended the federal reservo
act and tho shipping bill and declared
that, If its business is properly con
ducted, America has an unexcelled fu
ture before it.
"I want to see America seek not to
exclude, but to excel," said the presi
dent in discussing Amorican trade.
Ho spoke In support of tho tariff com
mission created by the last congress.
On the tariff the president said ho
did not fear to say that, previously,
tariff laws had been founded on the
ories. He did not fear the investiga
tion of tho facts by the tariff commis
sion. "It will look for the facts no matter
whom It hurBt," he said.
The president said he wanted tho
federal trade commission to make a
thorough investigation of Amorican
business.
Wants Thorough Investigation.
Tho president said he did not caro
whose opinion was contradicted, he
wanted the tariff commission to thor
oughly investigate foreign trade.
Amid thunderous applause tho' pres
ident declared one of hiB chief objects
had been.to see that nothing was dona
to Interfere with the" friendly relations
between the United States and Latin
America. Business Has Nothing to Fear.
"A few years ago American business
men took up their papers with a de
sire to sec what the government was
doing to them," he continued. "Now
they have no nervousness. There is
no contest between proper business
and the government.
"We are creating instrumentalities
through which a thorough investiga
tion can be made of every phase of
American business," tho president de
clared. Must Be Founded on Truth.
He was interrupted frequently by
hand-clapping.
"Business must be founded on
truth," he continued. "We must havei
co-operation between all." As a step
in this direction he advocated a law;
to allow American exporters to util
ize common selling agencies abroad.
"I despise monopoly and have an en
thusiasm for co-oneratlon." he de
clared.
To Remove Ingenlus Obstacles.
The trend of laws In the United
States, according to the president,
will be to remove all "ingenius ob
stacles" from tho activities of the peo
ple of the nation.
"Speaking of the need of more ships
for America," he asserted, "we can
not lose any time in getting the means
of delivering our goods to foreign
markets."
He explained the shipping bill by
saying that, under it, the government
will seek to build up trade routes, but
will step aside when private capital
wants to keep up the business.
"The real wealth of foreign relation
ship," he said, "Is the wealth of
friendship and common understand
ing. America Can Compete With All.
"There is only one thing I have ever
been ashamed of in America and that
is its timidity in face of foreign, com
petition. I know that American busi
ness men have enough brains to com
pete with anybody."
He spoke of the need of more effi-
ciency in the conduct of the American
business.
Must Use Skill and Brains.
"We want men who will prosper, not
because of the backing of their gov
ernment, but because of their skill and
brains." i
Tho president spoke emphatically,
and frequently slapped his right fist
on the palm of his left hand with a
resounding smack.
"My interest in American affairs,"
he said, "is to do my utmost in behalf
of the Intelligence of America for the
service of mankind."
As he concluded the band played
"The Star-Spangled Banner," and the
entire audience stood and cheered
again and again.

Dayton, Ohio, Sept, 25. The United

"You veterans aided In preserving Ll

from decay. We cannot be preserved
alone by the valor of ourancestors, Jl
by those of an earlier day, but we can,
indeed, be preserved If we keep allvo

"As I look to the future and great- ll
ly desire that we should find solution I'SH
for the economic problems of our Jl
country, I am deeply impressed with ''H
the fact that we must have a driving ''
power of progress, of love for our
country. Whatever our race, whatever "'1

must have an intense dovotion to our
country, the United States, if we are LH
going ahead In the troubulous days of
the twentieth century and hold our na- ''
tion whero it belongs in the front
ranks of the nations of the world. :H
"Surely, my friends, you must look f
into the future with some concern fll
as you think of the possibilities of iH
agitation and disturbance in this land. tijH
We, you and I, so far as I could, la- il
bored in the past for the preservation fl
of the union, but the union of states
must be typical of a union of spirit. fH
"We must have a sense of comradeship iil
that Is very real. Labor in all its activi- I'-H
