London. Sept. 24, 10.15 p. m. Of the
twelve big- Zeppelins -which invaded
the British Isles last night to deal
death and destruction from the skies
two today lay stark and black masses
of steel and aluminum, in the little
village of Mangold, Essex county.
They fell victims of the anti-aircraft
defences of London and outlying dis
"icta. Zeppelins Burned.
One came down a flaming torch, as
did the Zeppeline L-21, destroyed
three weeks ago, while the second,
disabled by gunfire, effected a landing,
which saved the lives of the crew
who tonight are prisoners in Eng
land. The crew of the first raider
died in the consuming flames of their
own shiD.
Captain's Body Found.
This latest raider to light her own
funeral way on English soil collapsed
and was consumed much more quiek
lv than the L-21. It is possible,
though, that some of the men were
still living when the great vessel
struck the ground. The captain's
body was found some distance from
the wreck.
Witnessed by Tens of Thousands.
The death and burning of the first
Zeppelin was witnessed by tens of
thousands of London's residents, but
the. wounding and descent of the sec
ond raider was a matter of doubt un
til today's official statements w?re
riven out. Few details are available
of this second raider's condition, but
it is reliably reported that the crew
surrendered to special constables.
Shrapnel Burst Like Skyrockets.
Mary who saw the shrapnel burst
ing like skyrockets above the invader,
which subsequently caught fire, think
there must have been several direct
hits. Many aeroplanes were aloft and
attacked the Zeppelins from all sides.
28 Persons Killed.
The raiders- took a heavy toll of
lives before their destruction, 8 per
sons being killed and 99 wounded in
the metropolitan district of London.
Two persons were, killed, probably
fo-ur. and sernteen were wounded
in the proviv -- he property dam

one railway station w.-; -lamaged,
some empty cars beir.s destroyed and
part of the track torn up.
Roar of Dropping Bombs.
The roar of dropping bombs was
heard in manv district where the
raiders were invisible. It is believed
that not more than two or threo in
vading Zeppelins which crossed the
east coast succeeded in reachinsr the
environs of London and that two of
these paid the death penalty gives
the greatest satisfaction to the mili
tary authorities. Apart from, the loss
In material, the casualties of he past
two raids, it is believed, will have a
depressing effect on the morale of the
Zeppelin crews in the future.
Londoners wore Jubilant today but
there was not the same exultant en
thusiasm as. three weeks ago, indicat
ing that the destruction of giant sky
raiders is already taken as an ordi
nary incident in this unusual world
war.
Located by Searchlights.
The fact tha the airships were
brought down well outside of Lon
don both last night and Sentember 3,
shows the care with which the de
fences hfve been developed. The ef
ficiency in dealing with tha raiders
wn-s further evidenced bv the speed
with which the searchlights nicked up
the f rst raider tht appeared over the
suburbs about midnisrht. Sudder'y

To the watchers in K'aox. however,
the snectBcle of tha finmlnqr falling
Zeppelins hal oil thn thrill of ex.

and their fortunate shots that
brought, the raiders to earth.
Attack Was Expected.
All London expected the attack last
night, the Germans evidently having
selected Saturdays for their greatest
efforts. But a bright moon deterred
any attempt since three weeks ago
when thirteen raiders came over the
sea. The change from the unlucky
thirteen to twelve last - night, how
ever, brought worse, rather than bet
ter luck to the flying squadron. From
the moment the first Zeppelin appear
ed it was evident that the raiders
were of the new and large types. This
has been borne out by the two
brought down.
Bodies Charred.
One of the burning Zeppelins in
falling crashed through a row of trees
in Essex, two of which pierced the
lattice work of the envelope supports.
As usual, the 'illage Are engine was
quickly on the scene and began put
ting water on the blazing wreck. Po
lice constables and volunteers remov
ed the bodies as rapidly as possible.
Some of those were charred beyond
all recognition, while others were still
white and recognizable,-.-All appeared
to be young men, well clad and wear
ing the remains of stout leather coats
and sohes of rather poor quality,
which is taken here to indicate that
good footwear is not plentiful in Ger
many. Wonder Casualties Were Not Greater
From the number of bombs drop
ped, both explosive and incendiary,
the authorities wonder why tho cas
ualties were not greater. The Zeppe
lins seemed abundantly applied with
ammunition.
Householders along, the thorough
fares heard the Bomb explosions
growing louder and louder as the
raiders came with the speed of an ex
press and took their baptism of fire
calmly as they passed and heaved a
sigh of relief as the reports diminish
ed in the distance.
The missiles dropped by the hostile
aircraft caused numerous fires and
demolished or damaged a larg-e num
ber of residences and stores in Lon
don. Casualties in London.
The casualties in the' Metropolitan
district are, according to an official
compilation, as follows:
"Killed men 17; women 8- children
3. Total 28.
"Injured men 4; women 37- chil
dren 7. Total 99."

On the battle front in France, aside

FOURTH WEEK OF MEXICO
AMERICAN JOINT COMMISSION.
American Members to Continue In
quiry Into Social nad Economic Conditions.
New London, Conn., Sept. 24. Pro
fessing satisfaction with the progress
already made, members of the Mexican-American
joint commission will
begin the fourth week of their confer
ence here tomorrow. It is expected the
American members will continue their
inquiry into the social and economic aa
well as the military problems of Mex
ico, on the ground that conditions in

related to internal affairs to justify
them in entering into an agreement
for border control without a definite
understanding of what changes for the
better are to be made nearer the seat
of government.
The Mexicans have received from
Andreas Garcia, Mexican consul at El

the attacking party obtained any am

peared in the city.

of Dead Diamond stream in the Dart
mouth College grant, a wild section of
country near the Main border, and ten
miles from the hotel from which they
set out Wednesday afternoon for a
stroll.
Two Days Without Food.
In seeking to return, they had lost
their bearings in the almost trackless
woods and for two days had wander
ed in quest of a habitation. Not un
til Friday did they find shelter i an
old lumber shack, where they remained
too tired to walk andy longer, and not
knowing tthe way to return. Mrs.
Denunison's feet were painfully swoll
en and it is doubtful whether she
could have continued much farther.

his wife were made by Earl Gould anc
Scott Copp, employes of the hotel, whe
had joine scores of others in person;
in the hunt. As a result of their suc

other friends of the missing couole
who arrived today to help in the
search, were on hand to greet Mr. anc
Mrs. Dennison when they wen
brought out of the woods tonight.

It was early this morning that th
two searchers, who had been tramping
the vicinity of JOeafl. Diamond Stream
through the night In -a heavy rain,
came on the abandoned logging camp
in which the missing couple "had taken
refuge. After giving such help as was
possible under the circumstances, one
of the young men went to a farm at
Wentworth's several miles away and
from there telephoned ford of the Den
nison's safety, without waiting to hear
the details of the experiences.
Although it was ten miles from Dix
