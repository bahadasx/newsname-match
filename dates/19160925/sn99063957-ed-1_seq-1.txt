j -
Oregon 's big show opened this morn
ing with every condition favorable,
itery foot of exhibition spneo taken in
the two pavilions nnd machinery hall,
find every condition pointing to the
uiost successful livestock show iu the
history of tho association.
Never before have there been oa the
.itatfl fair grounds at one time so muv
carnival attractions, nor has there ever
l.een a better prospect for thorough en
tertainment of the thousands who will
visit the grounds during the week.
Perhaps the feature which is attract
ing the most attention for tomorrow is
the horse show, which will take place
in a big tent on the grounds. For this
hIiow over a hundred entries have been)
made, and the feature will likely prove
to be all that its promoters have hoped. I
This is Children's day, and it is being
jnuue enjoyuoie lor tne youngsters by
plenty of music and a starting up of the
hundreds of attractions on the grounds.
The Sagebrush orchestra, composed of a
number of youngsters from Harney
county, many of whom are ncetupanied
lty their mothers, is being given much
attention. , - .
It had been planned that the snge
l.rush people would come in a special
Pullman, and that they would sleep in
the car while here, but yesterdny it
v as learned that the plan had somehow
misscarried and they were coining by
motortruck instead. It thus became in
cumbent upon the fair management to
provide sleeping quarters for them.
Tents and cots were hurriedly rust
Jed, but bedding was difficult to get,
nnd it was only due to the efforts of
Mrs. F. O. Deckebnch, Mrs. Carloton
Smith and other Salem ladies that the
lads and Insiog from Harney county
were properly taken care of.
The car shortage has had its effect
upon some of the exhibits', and owin?
to the inability of certain of exhibit
ors in the livestock department to get
here on time the stock judging slated
for this morning has been postponed.
Some complaint has been heard be
cause of mismanagement iu the camp
grounds, but everything seems to have
been fixed up satisfactorily this morn
ing, with Albert Tosier in charge.
The big days at the race track wit1
lie Wednesday and Thursday. Salon
nnd Portland days, respectively. Oi
Ihese days the 2:0S pace and the 2:1.'.
trot for purses of $2,000 will be run. It
is these two days when the greatest
crowds are sure to be present.
For the benefit of the old soldiers and
their families, the members of Sedge-
wick Post, No. 1, Woman's Kelief
Corps, of Salem, has established
headquarters ia the shady oak grove
insiue ine grounds, wliere during the
week they will keep open house. A
tent fitted with chairs and other com
forts has been erected, and the whole
is in charge of Mis. Florence Shipp, of
Snlem.
In the grove also enmping places for
me coy ncours. girls' instruction camp.
Rebekahs,' Women of Woodcraft and

SCIENCE BUILDS FACE

New York, Sept. 25. A face built of
modeling clay, constructed on the bare
bores of n skull, a check for flO found
in the clothing of a man supposedly
murdered nnd the recognition by friends
of the murdered man by his reconstruct
ed features, are responsible for the 'fact
that Giovannia Komium, of Brooklyn,
and Victor Vicciotto, are iu the Ray
mond street jail today.
l.ieuteunnt Grunt Williams of the Bu
real of .Missing Persons, aided by Dr.
Peccdini, an expert iu the testing labor
atories of the Board of Estimates re
built the features of Dominic I.aRosa
and dressed a skeleton iu cluthiuz sup
posed to be his. The two suspects are
now charged with tne murder of l.anosa
and his friend Kosnrio I'assnrrelle nnd
the police are investigating a report
that tho skeletons of two children nlso
have been found on the truck farm of
Vicciotto.
The body of Rosnrio rassarrelle was
found while the police were putting the
finishing touches on LaRosa 's 'face, nnd
the check found in Pussarelle's pocket
leu them to persons who quicKly identi
fied the made over features as those of
I. a It nan.
The feat of rebuilding the features of
I.aRosa was difficult, for the police hud
little to help them. The wisdom teeth
in the empty skull gave them some idea
of the victim's age and a few tufts of

forYear
New York, Sept. 25. More people
have beeu killed and injured by automo
biles on the streets of American cities
during this year than in all the Zeppe
lin raids oa England. Chicago and
New York lead in the number of deaths
with more than 200 each between Jan
uary I and September 1. The number
of fatalities ia other large cities is pro
portionately high, however, varying
with the population of the towns.
These figures, compiled today, on re
ports from a score of cities are based
upon police records, which bIiow a con
stantly glowing death list a result of
automobile accidents, desite improved
traffic laws that have beeu enacted.
Iu New York and other states even
more drastic legislation is being urged.
In the cities from which reports were
available today, figures up to Septem
ber 1 show that a total -of 1,040 persons
hnve been killed and more than 8,000
injured. Only partial lists of injured
were received and it is possible that
the complete toll would show almost
double this number.
In Zeppelin raids on England to date
about 308 have been and 870 wounded
in two years.
Police reports that 158 persons killed
and 4,484. injured on the streets of New
York up to September 1. The New
York state automobile association's esti
mate show 2211 killed, however, for New
York City and for the state outsido of
the metropolis 1112 killed.
Chicago records show 205 killed, w hile
Philadelphia reports 88.
In Detroit 03 were killed and 2,751
injured up to September 1, as compared
with 31 killed and 2,005 injured during
the same period last year. I.os Angeles
reports 75 nnd Columbus, Ohio, 40.
In many cities heavy penalties are
being inflicted for driving a car while
intoxicated and other remedial measures
are being considered.
Police Commissioner Wood has urged
drastic legislation for this state. The
next legislature will again be asked to
Jinss a law compelling every operator
of an automobile to obtain a license. At
present only chauffeurs are required to
do this.
New York and Chicago have special
traffic courts which handle only viola
tions of traffic rules.
Practically all cities now have strict
tiaffic rules "safety zones" for per
sons boarding street cars and speed
laws. The traffic, systems are largely
modeled after that introduced in New-
York, but improvements are constantly.

ARE UNDER ARREST
Two Arrested Today Charged
with Impersonating Gov

Chicago, Sept. 25. Two more arrests
on charges in connection with the nation-wide
blackmail syndicate, served
today to turn attention from the local
political fight which the case threatens
to develop into here.
Homer T. French, -who was seized y:3
terday charged with posing as a secret
service agent to force $13,000 in hush
money from a couple brought here some
time ago from New York, supposedly
by French and accomplices denied to

said Hinton G. Clnbauph, federal in
vestigator, has known all along where
he has been.
James Christian was re-arrested with
French but was later released on 10,000
bond. They are accused by Clubaugh
of assisting in the plot whereby A. R.
Wesley and Alice Williams, whose ad
dresses are withheld by Clabaugh, were
brought to Chicago from New York, put
through a mock trial before a fake fed
ernl commissioner and allowed to go by
paying tl 5,000.

GREAT ZEPPELIN
RAID
ENGLAND
ENDS IN DISASTER
.
Fourteen Or Fifteen In Fleel,
Three of Which Drop
Bombs on London
TWO ARE BROUGHT DOWN :
BY ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS
Claims Made by Both Sides
. Indicate 52 Airships
Wrecked Recently
London, Sept. 25. With three of Ger
many 's biggest and latest types of Zep
pelins brought down on English soil
within as many weeks, Britons today
believed London is now more socurs
against air raids than ever before de-.
spite, the fact that the last two raids,
were made with a greator number of air
craft than ever before employed.
.Military officials declare that the air.
defenses of London have stood the su
preme test in repulsing the fleet of
raiders which attacked the city on the
night of September 2 and again Satur-.
day night. In the first Instance an aero
plane brought down one ot the super-
Zeppelins. Latest reports indicate that'
air-craft guns jcored the hits on the.
two big airships which were destroyed
Saturday night. The latest estimate of
casualties put the number of men, wo
men and children Killed in the raid at
30. One hundred and ten were injured.
Of this number 28 wore killed and 99
injured in the metropolitan district of
London.
Fourteen or 15 airships took part in
the big rnid Saturday night, the Inst
official statement to bo issued by Gen
eral French declared. Only three of the
Zeppelins approached London for an at
tack, however, and they were driven off
by the anti-aircraft guns. The two air
ships brought down fell near tho little
village of .Mangold. Bodies of the crew
of one of the aircruisers were found
scattered about their burned cratt bad
ly charred. Twenty-two men, compris
ing th crew of the socond were made
prisoners by a lono constable who was
the first to reach the scone of the wreck
and in turn gave them over to the mili
tary authorities.
.... Thousands Watch Fight.
Thousands saw the first Zeppelin
which was entirely destroyed, fall like
a flaming comet through the sky. Sight
seers flocked to Essex county through
out Sunday and today to view the
wreckage of the big air cruisors. The
motors and other parts of tho Zopcplin,
less seriously damaged, were gathered
togethor by members of tho Royal Fly
ing corps, however, for inspection and
souvenir Beckers were kept at a dis
tance. Residents of the Essex villages, where
tho raiding monsters were sent to their
doom were absolutely unmoved by the
visit of the Zeppelins. There was re
joicing when the airships, comet-like,
made their first descent to destruction.
Hut nftcr the night of tho rnid was over
and tho Zeppelins lay, a tattered mas
of twisted steel there was little com
ment. One of the machines fell within half
a mile of a village with a population
of barely more than 1,000. And every
one of thesu persons holds an indif
ference which amounts to lethargy re
garding tho dangers to which they are
exposed by tho raiding German flyer.
Three airships brought to the ground
within three weeks by English gunners,
seems to have instilled in them a certain
confidence that they will bo protected,
no matter what comes.
62 Airships Lost Recently.
Expressions of commendation for the
udvuuce in the methods of defense for
Loudon and other sections of England
came from the press and officials alike
today. In most of the areas where the
airships wero noted, witnesses declare
there is absence of military damage and
injury to residents that is remarkable.
Searching for souvenirs rather than a
discussion of the effect of tho raid in
terests tho inhabitants of the districts
where bombs fell. Narrow escapes are
recounted by dozens, but they are pass
ed over lightly.
I'nprecedented aerial activity Is re
ported on all fronts along with the Zep-
