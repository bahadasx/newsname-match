TWO MACHINES IN COLLISION
Gen. Haig Reports British Airman
Came Through In Safety But
Opponent Perished.
London, Sept. 24 With the excep
tion of lruitless German attacks
against the French lines at the Abbe
Wood Farm, (south of Boiichaves-
ner,) and against the British posi
tions west of Lesboeufs, (north of
Coiubles,) there has been little ac
tivity on the part of cither infantry
or artillery on the Somme front in
the last twenty-four hours.
Weather conditions, however, have
been exceedingly advantageous for
aerial operations. All reports from
the front today indicate that the air
corps of both sides have been busy.
The afternoon report of the French
War Office records the destruction of
twenty-three German aeroplanes
while on the Soinnie front alone then
were twenty-nine commits in the air.
The British report tonight says that
five German aeroplanes were dc
stroyed on Saturday, cms making a
total of twenty-eight. Berlin tells of
the destruction of twenty-four Allied
aeroplanes, twenty of them on the
Somme front. The British admit the
loss of five of their machines.
Two French aviators, I'aris reports
tonight, dropped twelve bombs on
Fssen, the home of the great gun
works of the KruppR. and returned
safely to their aerodrome after a fight
of 500 miles. Seven other French
aeroplanes bombarded factories in the
districts of Rombnch nnd Thionvilie.
General Haig s report from head-
quarters tills evening announces five
bombing raids on strategic points be
hind the German lines. He also men
tions the destruction of a German
aeroplane by collision with a British
machine. The latter fell several
thousand feet, but its pilot managed
to regain control of it and got back
safely to the British lines.

To Wind Watches So They
Keep Good Time
Y
OU cannot secure the best serv
ices from a good wilelx or
clock unless! you know hoc,
to wind it so us to cause the
least wear and Irregularity In its deli
cate machinery.
A watch should be wound nt the
same time every day. If allowed to
run down, or even almost do so, nnd
then wound up until It will not wind
any farther, it cannot do as perfect
work as a watch that Is not allowed
to run to Its full capacity or wound
up until it is as tight as It can lie
made.
if the watch is wound both morning
mill evening at about the same hour
and the key Is given only enough
turns to wind it it little less than half
what It could be wound the watch Wfll
run mure evenly, wear much longer
and keep more accurate time than if
it Is wound up tight once u day.
A watch sprint: will last longer If it
Is wound when there Is the least ex
treme of temperature, nnd inornlhgnud
evening are. of course, the best iu that
respect.
It Is more or less daugterous. to wind
a watch during a heavy electric storm,
and it Is Is-st to avoid winding while
OU an electric car.
All eight day clock should be wound
twice a weid; at as regular periods as
possible to secure the best results.
Never ullow the (lock to run down,
and If posaible dfl not wind it until It
Is tight.
i elan by ssnjaMlerica just how many
turns of the key if takes t wind the
( 10 1 to run eight days, and then when
half the week Is gone wind the clock
by giving the key Just half us many
turns as it would require to wind It
the way. More accurate time will
be had. and it will avoid placing any
of the part on h strain, which Is fre
(plently the cause of good rtOCkS giving
out in some particular before they have
served half as long as tliev should.
A little attention to this advice will
Dgtheil the life of any watch or clock
and make It a belter timepiece.
