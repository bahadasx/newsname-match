GETTING THE RANGE OF THE

London, Sept. 24. Of the ''-twelve'
l big Zeppelins, which invaded the Brit-
ishes Isles last night to deal death ana
destruction from the skies, two today
lay stark and black masses of steel
and aluminum in the little village of
Mangold, Essex county. Th'ey fell
victims of the anti-aircraft defenses
of London and outlying districts.
, One came down a flaming torch, as
did the Zeppelin L-21, destroyed three
weeks ago, while the second, disabled
by gun fire, effected a landing which
saved the livesjf the crew, who to
day are prisoners in England. The
crew of the first raider died in the
consuming flames of their own ship,
but they were not so terribly charred
a? their predecessors. '

and was consumed much more quick

found some distance from the wreck.
Estimate This Morning Puts the At
tendance for the Season as
Larger than Ever
The city schools opened this morn
ing at 8:30 o'clock for a new ses
sion, with what Prof. H. W. Cassels,
principal, believes is a larger attend
ance than last year. The exact num
ber of students will not be known un
til Prof. Cassels lias had a chance to
check up the enrollment in the vari
ous classes. ' He roughly estimates
that the number of students in the
high school has increased consider
ably, and that the number in the low-
ei classes is about the same as last
year.
Forthe most part the hours this
morning were given to organization,
the assigning, of classes and of books
Short opening exercises were held in
the high school department. These
exercises were opened with a song
Rev. J. M. Gros3 read a passage from
the scripture; Rev. J. R. Herndon, of
fered a prayer. Short addresses were
made by Prof. Cassels, Mrs. William
Hocker, member of the city school
board, Mr. W. D. Cam former super
intendent of education for the county,
Rev. Herndon, and Rev. Gross. Mrs.
Allie Van Davis, teacher of expres
sion, gave a reading from "Hiawa
tha." The attendance of parents and
friends was very slight. Not more
than a dozen visitors were present in
the high school department.
The morning was bright and cheery
and students and teachers began their
work with enthusiasm. Many of the
students were at the school buildings
before the doors were open, an hour
oi more ahead of time.
Two things were, stressed in the ad
dresses made to the high school class
es. Prof. Cassels, commenting on the
very slim attendance of parents and
others at the opening exercises, and
pointing out the importance of hav
ing well attended exercises, said that
a3 long as the high school building
had no assembly hall it would be im
possible to have the efficiency in the
school that should obtain. He said
that an auditorium should be provid
ed as soon as possible. Many of the
schools of the state, in towns much
smaller than Ocala, have auditoriums.
Prof. Cassels said. Mrs. William
Hocker, members of the city school
board, and the first woman in Florida
to be elected to such a position, made
a plea tor a session of friendliness and
co-operation. She asked that the ses
sion of 1916-17 be cne of harmony
among teachers, students and par
euts. - Mrs. -""Hocker expressed the
wishes of the trustees for a most suc
cessful year of work. She said that
the trustees had provided the proper
facilities for the schools to the extent
of the means available. Mr. W. D.
Carn, former county superintendent
of schools, thought, with Mrs. Hocker,
that an effort should be made to
make the session a friendly one. Rev.
R. Herndon, pastor of the Presby
terian church, also thought Mrs.
Hocker's point well taken. Rev. J.
M. Gross, pastor of the Methodist
church, said that it would be impos
sible for the school to do its best work
without an auditorium, and he, too,
said that schools in towns much
smaller than Ocala -were provided
with assembly halls. Dr. Gross' spoke
of the fad that is sweeping the coun
try with regard, to children over-
tudying. He said that he had not
observed any tendency to over-study.
At the primary school building the
children gathered on the first floor
and began the year with song. Rev.
Bunyan Stephens, pastor of the Bap
tist church, offered a prayer, and
Prof. J. H. Brinson, superintendent of
the schools for the county, made a
brief address. There were many new
faces in the primary grades. The at
tendance, according to Miss Nellie
Stevens, principal, is about the same
as last year. The enrollment this
morning was about 198 boys and girls.
In the beginner's class for girls 15
enrolled, in the beginner's class for
boys 26, in the advanced first grade
for boys 26, for girls 32, in the sec
ond grade 56, and in the second grade
19 boys and 24 girls.

CORNER OF
THEIR KIHGOOM
Being Faithfully Guarded by
Little Remnant of Free,
Belgians
the
(Associated Press)
Flushing, Netherlands, Sept. 23.
King. Albert has aged under the heavy
cares and sorrows of the present time,
and his hair is beginning to turn gray,
according to the latest news from the
Belgian front. His majesty never
leaves the small strip of territory over
which the Belgian flag still flies, re
fraining from visits to places in
France or to Ste. Adresse, where .his
government has its seat. If the king
of England or President Poincare
want to meet the Belgian sovereign,
they have to go to this corner by the
Yser.
The soldiers deeply appreciate the
fact that their sovereign and commander-in-chief
shares with them the
monotony of this marshy bit of coun
try, waiting, like them, for the day
when Belgium shall be free once more.
His majesty is frequently seen by his
men in the trenchas, in barracks, on
the sands and in the dunes. It is said,
indeed, that no one knows better than
he the 25 or 30 miles of trenches
where the Belgian troops keep vig
ilant guard day and night. He is
particularly fond of visiting the ad
vanced posts, and his troops always
feel some amount of ; anxiety when
they descry the king's tall figure tra
versing the footbridges only some
hundreds of meters distant, from the
enemy,

in great veneration by the entire
army.

this new tyPS of heavy annored

new and terribleweapon of war?-
For weeks past I have been hearing

men wouiu anve everyining oeiore
it. News of it was a secret not to be
revealed until the day it came into ac
tion. Nobody was to know where or
how it was made or yet what it was.
The men who manufactured it were
bound by" oath not to say anything
aD0Ut lt- To make assurance doubly
sure they were interned within a vast
area whose boundaries were guarded
by armed men every hundred yards.
Once within, they were never allowed
out. Notices posted at the entrances
warned intending intruders thev
would be shot at sight.
I Then I heard that the new weapon
had already reached the scene of
operations in large numbers, and that
yet greater, numbers were to follow,
If . the. enemy was to hear anything
about it at all, they must hear now.
Un a" few days more it would be in
action. The results which might be ex
pected would be stupendous.
It was impossible not to be stirred
by the mystery that surrounded the
new- arm and by- the confident faith
of those who knew of its irresistible
power. It was a gigantic car, a colos
sal juggernaut, a moving arsenal of
unimaginable driving force. Nothing
could stand before it. It would pass
over trenches like fiat ground, climb
ou of beds of riverb and walk over
houses as over ant hills.
I In the inferno of its interior the
