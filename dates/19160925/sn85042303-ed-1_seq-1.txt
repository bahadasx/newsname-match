FOURTHWEEK
The Oil is Higher Grade Than Healdton
and while the capacity of '.the well is
not determined, an immense pool is
indicated. Means millions to city of
Ardmore.
Another pool of oil has been added to the Ardmore assets
by the coming in of the Fox fiehfc last night. '
The oil shot over the eighty-foot derrick at 1!G0 feet, and
the well was capped as soon as possible so that the real extent
of the flow has not been determined.
That the oil is there, and in large quantities, however, is
established without the shadow of a doubt and excitement can
be expected to run high in Ardmore from now on.
The history of that section reads like a fairy tale. Months
ago the oil fraternity began to cast their eyes on the Fox dis
trict and little by little land which was worth but little, was
leased on its speculative value at prices far 'in excess of its
realty value. When the McMan Company put up its rig, in
terest, then exceedingly great, was intensified, 'and from that
date until now it has been the center of speculative eyes.
Before daylight this morning the news reached Ardmore
"The McMan well has come in," and like wifdfire the news
spread all over the city, and before eight o clock scores of
autos were speeding to the Fox field. About noon today the
report was verified, and as late as three o'clock the Ardmore
ite was able to get the above report; that the well came in,
with oil shooting over the derrick, and that it had been shut
down preparatory to being gauged. That the oil is of better
grade than Healdton but not quite as high as Cushing, was
also given out by the Company.
Its importance to Ardmore cannot be overestimated. Scores
of local men have interests in that sectipn and it has been re
peatedly stated that "if the Fox field came in," some extensive
developments were to take place immediately in this city.
