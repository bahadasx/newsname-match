In the following Hrticlo the gentle
man mentioned la a brother-in-law of
Mr. E. Q. Brldgea of tills city, he hav
ing married Minn Iva Bridges, a
daughter of the la'e Sam Bridges. '1 lie
article Is taken from the WellBton,
Ohio, Sentinel and followa:
Once more It has been demonstrated
that in selecting men for position; of
reaponaibility, Jackson County's sons
rank among the foremost.
This has been evidenced from (he
fact that effective November 14, 1H6.
W. E. Mulllneauz, former Agent C. H.
D. railway at WellBton and recently
Chief Clerk of the Pere Marquette at
Toledo has been appointed agent of the
P M at that place.
It Is doubtful that a more popular
courteous and efficient agen ever
worked for any railroad than "Billy"
Mulllneauz and there was genuine re
gret when the consolidation of the B.
O. 8. W. and the C. H & D. offices
at Wellston caused his transfer to oth
er duties.
After he left Wellston he accepted
a position wlh Mr. B. E. Cain, formerly
Superintendent of the Wellston division
C. H. ft D. who is presumed was quick
to recognise Mr. Mullineaux's excep
tional ability as an agent. Ilia recent
promotion proves that his friend esti
mation of his ability was based on this
fact
The agency at Toledo Is one of the
Olggest railroad propositions in th
State of Ohio and we confidently pre
dict that It la not too big for ' Genial
Billy," and his many friends Join in
wishing him unlimited, success n his
new undertaking.

ek the opening yesterday of the

sales last year. With the tales block
p.i at 4 o'clock, closing time, a total of
231,79(1 pounds had been dlHposod of,
at an average price of $11.38 a hun
f'.'eil pounds. Last year a total of 78,
89fi pounds were sold for an average
price of 9.05 a hundred pounds.
The domnant feature, however, of
the day's sales, was the tatretnely
hlirh price paid for the lowest grades
of tobacco offered. The lowest price
snv basket brought was $7.75 a hun
dred pounds, and this prior was paid
for but one basket. There were prob
ably not more than fifty baskets that

MIKE BROWN
"The Square Deal Man".
With Uooa Prices.
The opening of the tobacco seaaon of
1916-17 will open in Maysvllle on next
Tueaday morning at o'clock. The
place of the opening sales has not
been announced as yet. All arrange
ments have been made for the opening
of the market and it is expected that a
large amount of the weed trill be
brought here this week by the grow
ers In this section so as to take ad
vantage of the opening prices and to
get some Christmas money.
While no official announcement haa
been made to Indicate the prices that
will be paid thla year, yet the general
belief Is that higher prlcea will prevail
than formerly, partly due to the fir
eign demand and partly to the upward
trend of prices in all other products
The crop this year la an unusually
large one and although not until recet
ly has their been opportunity to do
much stripping, yet the farmers have
taken advantage of their opportunities
and the first of the week will ahow the
tobacco wagons rolling in Maysvllle by
the score.
From reports received of tobacco
sold In this and surrounding counties,
judgment can be made of the prices
for the season. For crops that have
been houaed we And that buyers are
offering from 10 to 16 centa, very few
going over these prices. Compared
with prices of a year ago, these are
from 20 to 25 per cent better.
The facilities for the handling of
tobacco will be greatly Increaseu mis
year. With one new warehouse, there
is ample room to take care of all the
tobacco that comet Into the city, and
II can be placed under ehelter at
once. None of the old houses have en
larged their floor space but they have
made various improvements to add to
the ease of handling the weed as soon
as possible.
The redrying facilities In this city
have always been very great. The buy
ers are enabled to handle the tobnceo
quickly and this will tend to increase
tne sales here. The growers wish to
have their crop handled as quickly as
possibly and to bring the best prices
If the redrying plants have more to
bacco on hand than they can take care
of the tendency will be to stop buying
and tobacco will then bring lower
prices. This condition will not exist
in Maysvllle ! I'atrolmen Dudley Illoonihuff, Dud

where the leading buying companies
maintain redrying plants. That this
means money In the pocket of the pro
ducer is self evident, as when tobacco
must be packed Into hogsheads and
shipped into a rehandling plant, then
removed from tho hogsheads, redried
and again packed, it la more expensive
for the purchaser than when it Is
merely handled from the warehouse to
the redrying plant.
