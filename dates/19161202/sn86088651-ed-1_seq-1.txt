THE EAGLE'S CREEDS.
No. 12. Self -Respect
Do not use the arts of friendship in seeking or holding
trade.
They have no place in business.
You are not selling personality. Clients worth having
are not buying good fellowship, You insult them when
you intrude it
You will never gain the world's respect until you show
self-respect
In advertising, any worthy expert is a man of rare ac
complishments. He has spent a lifetime in acquiring the
ability he offers. It was coined from precious years.
You degrade such talents when you try to sell them as
courtiers sell manners.
Then flattery little flatters when used as a business
bribe. Compliments used to sway men's judgement are
far from complimentary.
In any enterprise worth winning, fawning brings con
tempt Seem the leader If you wish to lead.
Merit is the question in every business deal. Let it stand
unhampered and alone.
Alas for the man who ventures In advertising with a
sycophant as pilot Better, if necessary, a qualified boor.
