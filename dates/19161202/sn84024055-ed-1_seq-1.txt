WOULD ENABLE TTTM TO HOLD ON TO THE OFFICE AS AGAINST
COL. AUGUST W. MILLER.

MILLER WOULD BE ELECTED STATE'S ATTORNEY AND HON. MAC
LAY HOYNE WOULD BE OUT IN THE COLD AND THE FINAL RE
SULT OF THE LATE ELECTION WOULD BE REVERSED OR TURNED
UPSIDE DOWN.
Sheriff White of Jackson county has
gain been defeated in his attempts to
isform the execution of Elston Scott
to a grand holiday affair, for this
eek His Hon. Edward F. Dunne" for
e tenth time reprieved him until
ch 1C, 1917, so after that date it
be up to Governor Frank O. Low-
ien to deal with Elston Scott and
eriff White.
It is also freely predicted that Gov-
or Dunne, will, after the 8th of De-
:enber pass "Chicken Joe" Campbell
a over to Governor Lowd.en in case
is leading attorney F. L. Barnett fails
o move on into the Supreme Court
ith his case by that time.
It must be further admitted that
Governor Dunne is one of the most hu-
e Chief Executives that Illinois
ever had that under no circum
stances does he believe in capital pun
ishment and for our part we are strong-
jly inclined to follow in the footsteps
of the present chief executive of this
state in that respect.
The Hon. John W. Rainey still con
tinues to loudly bcof and foolishly play
8 baby act. simnlv because he met
& failure in his attempt to be re
verted clerk of the Circuit Court of
Gl county. Kijjht here it micht be
& to remind that highly distin-
Pfelftl .viiMeman, who is so full of
conceit, that he entertains the idea
"at what ho docs not know pertaining
to N'wvthing in general is not worth
knoivii,.; :it all; that ho hag no one t0
l'kme hut himself for his failure in
"at direction.
Un several oee.nsinns in tlin n.nst.
our years, some Colored men who
ed him wol, called on him and in-
"Oated to him flint nvrui tlimmli Tin
not entertain any special love for
ft Colored people it would be good
W't'fs on s j. art to permit at least
10 Colored man to be in evidence
Icro ;n his office, so that the
Colored people would be in a position
to say that he is or was a fair or liberal
minded Democrat who was more than
willing to deal fair and square with all
classes of Mb fellow citizens regardless"
of their race or 'their religion.
Nothing could induce him to recede
from his narrow contracted position
and he had his shallow mind firmly
made up on. that point, namely, that
no Colored man would be permitted to
work in his office, even for one day,
notwithstanding the fact that thou
sands of Cqlored taxpayers have, dur
ing the past four years, assisted to pay
him his salary which has enabled him
and his family to live in grand style
and to feed at the public crib at the
expense of the small property owners
of this city and county.
A change in three hundred and fifty
votes would have put him in the lead
of Col. August W. Miller and he could
have very easily secured that number
of extra votes among the Colored peo
ple if he would have placed a Colored
man in his office who could have gone
out among, his friends and the Colored
people in general and rustled up more
than that number of votes for him.
Mr. Rainey feels that Judge Thomas
F. Scully should toss out all votes in two
hundred and sixty-eight precincts in
two or three wards in order to let him
run in ahead of Col. Miller, so that he
could continue to hold on to tbe office.
That would bo a dandy idea, for, ac
cording to his way of figuring, Hon.
Harry B. Miller could or would be
elected State's Attorney and Hon.
Ma clay Hoyne would be left out in the
cold that the Hon. Charles E. Hughes
would bo the next president of the
United States instead of tho Hon.
Woodrow Wilson and that the final re
sult of the late election in all parts of
this country would bo turned upside
down.

Dear Editor:
We write this letter tf or publication
in your next issstte because we feel
that it touches upon a situation of vi
tal importance to every member of the
race.
Negroes in large numbers are leaving
tho South for the North. Many are se
curing good positions. Those that are
sober and responsible and know how to
give an honest day's toil are holding
their positions. The indolent, inefficient
men, however, are soon discharged, be
come a burden to the Northern commu
nities and bring reproach i;nd humilia
tion to thrifty Colored citizens in com-
mumties wh,ere White people have .not
hitherto Considered Negroes undesir
ables. The National League on Urban Con
ditions Among Negroes urges the right
thinking Negroes of the South and
everywhere to discourage the wholesale
migration of shiftless people between
any two points, be they North or South.
Tho League also warns Negroes against
fraudulent agents who are collecting
employment fees and who disappear
soon afterwards.
Negro labor is in demand. Use that
fact to improve the efficiency of that
labor by demanding: First, better
wages where the wages of Colored men
are below the current wage; second,
better working conditions so that your
health will not bo impaired by the
work you do; third, better living con
ditions both for yourself and family,
so that your efficiency as a worker will
not be impaired by living conditions
which prevent proper rest and recrea
tion to fit you for the day's labor, and
base these demands on. the facts that
all these things will make your work
more valuable to yourself and to your
employer and make for better feeling
between the races.
The National Urban League urges
Negroes everywhere to take advantage
of this great industrial opportunity to
work in cooperation with their local
neighbors whether North or South, for
the improvement of conditions which
will affect both races.
Very truly yours.,
E. M. Jones,
Executive Secretary.

fax says, "I feel that 'The Birth of a
Race' is the second emancipation of
the race."

Referring to the retirement of Sergt.
Dalbcrt P. Green, 25th U. S. Infantry,
after 25 years'- service, the last of
which was at Honolulu, the Star-Bulle
tin of that place says:
'Sergeant
Green has been the best known and
most liked man in tho 25th for years.
Ho has well earned his retirement, and
can proceed to his home feeling that he
has given the active years of his life
to his country and has a splendid rec
ord behind him of duty well performed.
"The oldtimers in the regiment arc
gradually going out, and their loss has
been severely felt. To them the regi
ment is indebted for its splendid repu
tation and a loyalty that has been
characteristic of tho 25th Infantry,
One of tbe last to. go is Sergeant Green,
and ho leaves a vacancy that will be
very hard to fill. Ho was givon char
acter 'Excellent' on tho eight dis
charges he has received from the Ar
my, and was recommended to receivo a
certificate of merit for meritorious
service rendered near Bamba, Luzon,
P. L, Nov. 26, 1899.
At a recent convention a minister
offered tho following toast: "To save
an editor from starvation, take his
paper and pay for it promptly. To
save him from bankruptcy, advertise
in his paper liberally. To save him
from despair, send him every item of
news of which you can get hold. To
save him from profanity, write plain
ly on ono sido of tho sheet and send
in your contribution as early as pos
sible. To savo him from mistakes,
bury himT Dead pcoplo aro tho only
