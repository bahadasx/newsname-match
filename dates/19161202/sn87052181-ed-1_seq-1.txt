TO JOIN T
AMERICAN EXPEDITION SAID
BE ON WAY TO CHIHUA
HUA CITV.
TO
PURPOSE IS TO "GET VILLA"
American Commander Took No Ac.
tlon Without Securing Consent of
Interested Parties Original
Instructions Broad Enough.
Washington. A report Is In circu
lation In Washington that MaJ. Gen.
Pershing, commander of tho Ameri
can punitive expedition now In Mex
ico, had sent a force of troops to tho
relief of Gen. Trevltio, commander of
tho Carranzlsta army engaged In de
fending Chihuahua City. Secrolary
Baker declined to comment on tho
report, which gives tho impression
that it has foundation.
If American troops havo been sent
to Chihuahua City, tho reason for this
action Is plain. Officially, they will
not be ordered to afford rollof to tho
Carranza forces, but to mako an ef
fort to rapture Francisco Villa, who
is said to bo personally In command
of tbo contingent that has been trying
to capture Chihuahua City, and was
said to have returned there after hav
ing been driven off in an engagement
last work.
One ot tho purposes of the Persh
ing expedition was to "get Villa,"
dead or alive, and with definite know
ledge that ho is near Chihuahua City,
Gen. Pershing might feel his instruc
tions required him to send troops in
that direction.
It is doubtful, however, if Gen.
Pershing took action of lhat kind
without knowledge and consent of tho
Carranza authorities.
