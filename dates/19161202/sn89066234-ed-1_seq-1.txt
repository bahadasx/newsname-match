Why Union Men Scab at Elections
Portland. Ore.. Nov. 17, 1010
Friend Phil. Enclosed find 81,
nd dont forget to aend the Kick
er on. 1 would like to ask you n j
question, and you can answer it :
thru the Kicker if you wish.
Why dOM the Socialist pi" ss up
hold unionism'. An- the, not a ,
trust in themselves'.'
i think the non-union man who.
votes i Socialist ticket is a bet
ter man than the union man who
votes a scab ticket.
When the unions are on strike.
th.- want the ipport or all, and
everybody in ist help them to win.
If the,1! win, a fe v get good jobs
and hchI Wage, and the rest get
nothing.
The Socialist press has always
lought the union man's fight ;
the Socialists have done every
thing in their power to help the
unions, and the unions have al-
onva annanted the help of the So- I
ntaltatfl nut when the Socialists I
ask their support on election day
the unions just tell them to bo to
hell and vote a scab ticket.
WHY do the Socialists uphold
unionism? Respectfully.
ti, U. PALMER.
The Kicker is Rind to receive
such letters of inquiry. 1 only

inquiries especially the Tanners

cause the majority of union mem

chief weapon la the ballot inteUH

principle of unionism wrong. The
Socialist party is a party ol prin
ciple. It has a program. And
unionism is in line w ith both prin
ciple and program.
The trouble with the unions
is that the members themselves
do not understand unionism.

But the labor movement nas
advanced considerably in the past
few years, in spite of such past

During the past labor was organ-

This means tnax eacn

occupation stood aione
and on its own ooiiom. uu uw
would often scab on another.
Let us take, for instance, the
railway service. Here was tin en
gineer's union, a conductor's un
ion, a fireman's union, a switch
man's union, and so on. If the
firemen struck for better condi
tions, all of the other .railwny
ciafts were not concerned. The
union switchmen or breakmen
could fill the place of the struck
firemen and thereby cause their
defeat .
It took some severe jolts to get
tlie trainmen to discover the
weak spot, but they finally found
it and now all of these organiza
tions are ONE. They have quit
cabbing on each other. And
when they demanded " 8-hour
day and threatened to strike if
it was refused, the whole nation
trembled.
It took some time to g"t the
men this far. The fight is still
on. Working men ns a class

WE WANT TO KNOW

IS LABOH PKDI'KRTV?
An interesting question is How
before the Industrial v. . : . ; f t s
United States.
is LABOH PHOPERTVV
The Massachusetts
court has held that labor is pi
petty. The American Federation
of Labor, recently in national
convention, declared it would m-
nora the decision, This may get
them in jail or shot !
Not being an authority, I can
not say whether or not is cor i
property, yet 1 cannot see what i
else can be made of it under the
wage system.
Anyway, it was necessary for
the court to hold that labor Is
property Ln order to upset the
Clayton law enacted by congress
to catch the labor vote. This
law declares that labor is not
property, and that therefore la
bor is not subject to tue anti
trust law. But the court holds
differently and we are governed
by courts.
Under tlie wage system. 1 don't
see how that decision can be
questioned, If the wage-system
is right, then. In my Judgment,
tlie decision is right. Labor is
bought and sold, just as bread
and meat.
The objection of Senator La
Follette, that tlie possessor of
labor power cannot separate him
self from it. and must sell him
self into the bargain, cuts no Ice,
That is exactly what he does
Therefore the term used by tin
socialists, "wage-slave."
it is encouraging to have our
highest courts uphold the conten
tion of the Socialists that he Who
works for wages is a slave. The
plates are getting their robber

eagerly paid ten cents a word
for his articles for thev wanted
something that would Interest

either ridiculed or ignored him
