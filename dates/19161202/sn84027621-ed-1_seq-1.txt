Hi INTERESTING EVENT " :
It's a long way to look back over
the series of fairs, since the first one
was held nine years ago, but so far
as we can remember only one or two
hnve had larger dismays, and all the
observers whom we have consulted in
the. matter say that the exhibits were
arranged to the best advantage in any
fair yet.
It must impress itself on everybody
who viewed the collection of exhibits
that Marion county people can raise
within their own borders a greater
variety of useful articles than any
ether county in the state, if not in
America. It must occur to them that
if by some convulsion of nature all the
rest of the jA'orld sank into the sea,
leaving Marion county an island, its
people could keep on living, and living
in comparative comfort.. ;
It also appears that Marion coun
ty's long suit is raising cattle and
hogs. It is difficult to comprehend
how better stock can be raised any
where. From buying nine-tenths of
its meat abroad, as it did twenty
years ago, Marion county now sell3
more meat than it buys, and the time
is not far off when it will raise all its
own meat and ship at least an equal
supply.
It is also evident that Marion can
raise all the feed for its stock, "and
then some. Owing to climate, it.will
probably be always obliged to buy
corn at some seasons of the year, but
there is always range, and when it
cames to raising hay and filling silos,
the only limit to the capacity of the
county is the area of its land.
Excepting the school children and
girls and boys of the canning, corn
and pig clubs, the crowd at the fair
was rather 'lierht yesterday. It is
probable that if it hadn't been for the j
interest taken in fhese young folks
and their work not more than a thou
sand people would have been present, j
These girls and oys are doing a
great work, and deserve all the en
couragement they are receiving. They
will carry on the work of making
their county prosperous with far
greater advantages than their parents
had.
Friday was a very busy day at the
fair, particularly among the judges,
. who were closing up the most impor
tant duty of awards to the exhibitors.
The canning club boys and girls
had their parade, marching to the fair
grounds from the square and taking
seats in the grandstand. They were
addressed by Superintendent Brinson,
Prof. McQuarrie, Chairman Cam, Mrs.
Hocker," and Messrs Chambliss, Ed
wards and Osborne of the three banks,
and Mr. Essig of Indiana, who was
present to act as judge of tKie pig
show, and finally Postmaster Rogers.
The girls and boys listened most pa
tiently and were rewarded with a fine
dinner served them by the ladies of
the Woman's Club in an arbor spe
cially built for them in the angle
formed on the west side of the agri
cultural building.
The afternoon passed most pleas
antly for all, seeing the exhibits, the
races and the carnival attractions.
About sundown the fair closed, and
we never saw a fair disperse so quick-
, , ; : rw,e,Q
gvounds like snow in a spring freshet,
and the exhibitors took most of their
goods out before dark.
With the exception of Congressman
Clark, there was no celebrity at the
fair. We had only our own people and
a number of neighbors from the next
door counties. We had no drawing
cards. Even our congressman went
around so unostentatiously that com
paratively few knew he was here.
FAIR NOTES
The transportation business was
f handled better than at any other fair.
'The auto rate of 25 cents a round
trip was very satisfactory and the
drivers deserve credit for" the skill
and courtesy with which they behav-
. aavA 4 VIA V ft a
KhV IV III- I ha I MM HA
ed. Several buses gave slower trips
for 10 cents each way, and they, too,
did well.
The prettiest exhibit at the fair was
the equestriennes Mrs. Weller Car
michael; Miss Annie Davis, Miss
Roller, Ocala; Miss Siler, Oak; Miss
Ruby Edwards, Irvine irresistible
combinations of feminine and equine
beauty. Mrs. Carmichael took the
blue ribbon for the best lady , rider,
and Miss Siler the red. Misfj Ed
wards took the blue ribbon fpr the
best girl rider, and Miss Roller the
red.-
Frank Ditto as usual made a most
efficient "man on horseback," here,
there and everywhere else. He has
had charge of a great share of the
outside arrangements' for the last six
weeks, and much of the credit for the
smooth way things were run is due to
his skill and care. ,
If all the ladies in the country were
as efficient in a business way as Mrs.
Anna Tweedy, secretary of the asso
ciation, men would simply have to
turn business1" affairs over to them
and go to washing the dishes.
The ladies of the civic committee
were the. busiest little bunch on the
grounds. Feeding hundreds of people,
they had hardly time to snatch a
mouthful themselves.
Mrs. MoorhjeJ gave a sigh" of relief
when the fair closed. ' She said her
year's work was done, and she did not
have anything to do but begin on an
other. 5
That . battleship of a . bed, with a
trundlebed under it, in the Woman's
Department, attracted much attention.
After seeing it, we understood why so
many times in old novels the hero or
shero was represented as barricading
the door with the bed in " order to
keep out the villain. But we don't
understand how anybody but Samp
son or Hercules ever moved such a
bed by himself. The trundlebed must
have been a comfy place for the bids
in cold weather.
The pig club boys are much encour
aged with the results of their work.
Loris Hall of Lowell sold his seven
Hampshires on the ground at a good
price. Marshall Cam sold seven of
his" eight. Van Liddon was offered a
hundred dollars for his pen, . which
w;ould have been a profit of $62 since
last February. These are not Wall
street profits, but there are no losses
tc counter-balance them.
No hungry person could look at the
canned goods exhibit without a desire
to eat clear thru it.
m m m
The Rutherford shows did not stay
over until tonight as they intended.
They began packing up last night and
left today for their quarters in Pitts
burg, Pa. They created a good im
pression here gave good shows for
the money and treated everybody well
The motordrome was a fine exhibi
tion, and "The Whip" took the popu-
Iar fancy. There is a suspicion that
, . , ,
the man who invented the whip was
drunk at the time, but he certainly got
there with the goods.

(Associated Press)
London, Dec. 2. Admiral Baron
Beresf ord, in an address last night ad
vocating a stronger naval policy, said,
"the crisis of the war is now that the
Germans are going to send subma
rines into the Pacific and wherever
the British trade routes lay. The
state of affairs is most unsatisfactory
with thousands of 4 tons of , foodstuffs
waiting to come to England and which
may be diverted to Germany. The
menace requires new strategy and
tactics."

Indications pointed to the proba
bility that two great flanking move
ments are in progress on the Ruman
ian front. The Russians apparently
are making one in the hopes of saving
the Rumanian armies and possibly
Bucharest. The Teutons are making
the other to force the evacuation of
Bucharest and cut off its defendersr
The Russians are attacking fiercely
on a front of approximately two hun
dred and fifty miles along the Mold
avian and Bukowina borders. They
are declared to already have had suc
cess leading to the expectation the
German invaders supply lines from
the north may be menaced. Berlin
declared the Russians and Rumanians
gained no successes here.
The Rumanians are threatened
from the southeast by General Von
MacKenzen's forces, which control
virtually the entire Danube as far as
Tchernavoda. They semed likely to
attempt to throw their forces acress
the river further east to outflank
each line occupied by the retiring Ru
manians.
Berlin announced that Teuton cav
alry advancing from Campulung de
feated the Rumanians in a -pitched
battle and broke through their lines.
More, than six thousand Rumanians
have been captured. The Teutons
have reached the Argechu river. Ber
lin said the Russians attempted to
advance near Smorgen and .Pinsk, on
the Russian front, without success. :..
ARTILLERY WAS ACTIVE
German artilelry was active north
of Ypres and near Gueu de Court on
the Franco-Belgian front last night,
London announced. Other fronts
were comparatively quiet.
ARRANGED TRUCE IN ATHENS
London, Dec 2. A truje thas been .
arranged in Athens after a day of
terror in which Venizelists fought
royalists and Greek troops fired upon
the entente forces which had been
landed, according to Admiral Du Four
net, to maintain order. King Constan
tine finally agreed to surrender the
mountain guns demanded and the al- ;
lied troops are being withdrawn. The
disturbances began as soon as the al
lied troops landed. Greek troops
fired upon the allied troops and a
pitched battle occurred between Ven
izelists and royalists in the stadium.
A news dispatch said the total cas
ualties "were reported to be more
than two hundred.
RUSSIANS CLAIM TEUTONS ARE
REPULSED
Petrograd, Dec. 2. The Russians
have captured the western part of the
Tchernavoda bridge across the Dan
ube, said the war office. The Teutonic
forces have been driven back south
of Bucharest, and Tzomana and Gost
inari recaptured.
CONSTANTINE GIVES UP HIS
CANONN
Athens, Dec. 2 The Greek king
has agreed to give up the artillery de
manded by the Entente Allies. Allied,
troops are being withdrawn from
Piraeus, S00 still being on guard at .
the Zappeion. An Entente diplomat
informed the Associated Press corres
pondent that the troops were with
drawn after King Cons tan tine agreed
to surrender six batteries of mount
ed artillery. The French legation was
fired upon during the crisis. Greek
military authorities and assorted
rowdies did the firing. The secretary
of the British legation was arrested
in the street by a Greek patrol but
was released at the police station.
