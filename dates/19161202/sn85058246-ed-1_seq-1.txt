THANKSGIVING
EATS ENJOYED
BY TROOP H
Nogales, Ariz., Nov. 2C, 191G.
Mr. M. R. Hovey, Sec'y.
Commercial Boosters Club,
Logan, Utah.
My dear Mr. Hovey:-
Thls will acknowledge receipt of
your kind favor of tho 22nd. Please
permit me, through tho Commercial
Boosters Club In behalf of tho mem
bers of Troop H, to thank tho kind
peoplo of Cacho county for their
warmness of heart and generosity.
Wo will receive the wealth of good
things they aro sending with thank
ful hearts anu Thanksgling day will
bo mado ono of tho happiest wo
have spent on tho border. It was
certainly splendid of tho club to got
behind tho movement to remember
us so handsomely and we aro all
highly appreciative.
Wo aro well and, what Is more Im
portant, are also all clean, as was
certified by tho surgeon who mado
a searching personal examination to
day. It has been, my ambition to
bring back to Cache county a troop
whoso memobers aro as clean as
when they left Logan and I am sure
I am going to bo ablo to do this.
Wo havo a Bplondld lot of soldiers
and I am very proud, Indeed, of
what thoy havo accomplished In their
flvo months of service I am sure
that tho peoplo of Cacho will feel
equally proud of them. Our spirits
are good, even though It Is truo that
wo have had some disappointments.
Of course wo want to bo roleased
and aro moro than ready to go home,
but,jtp a man, wo want to bo releas
ed honorably and aftor our work
here is done. As yet, thero Is noth
ing to Indicate definitely how mu6h
longer wo will bo hold In service on
tho border nnd sometimes It looks
as though our stay may bo consider
ably prolonged, but therb are somo
signs that point to an earlier re
lease and we aro hoping to eat our
Christmas dinner nt home. If we
nro disappointed In. this, we will still
r naln In service without sorlous
complaint.
Ono of tho other troops of our
squadion has ben recalled from bor
der patrol work further west and Is
now locntod with us hore nt Nogales
camping, sharing with Troop II, tho
Buena Vista patrol.
This has lightened our patrollng
considerably and we have moro tlmo
for drill and other work. Wo havo
had no troublo whatever slnco wo
entered tho moro serious phaso of
tho work hero nnd I think tho rela
tives at homo need havo no unduo
anxloty over tho future. Evory man
is doing his part and doing it well.
Wo havo established a good reputa
tion nnd nro going to mnlntaln It.
Wo havo had somo very sevoro
weather and somo very cold nights,
but tho days aro gonorally warm and
bright. It Is noarlng tho tlmo of tho
winter rains and whllo thoy aro on
wo aro llkoly to havo somo discom
forts, but the war department Is tak
ing good caro of us and making all
necessary provisions for our com-
frt- . . .
I am personally very grateful to
you for your kindly expressions and
trust that I dosorvo them all. Thoro
havo been criticisms, not a few and
and somo of thorn havo beon unkind,
to put It mildly, but I am trying to
do my whole duty by tho service and
by tho members of my troop and if
I am ablo to do this to the measure
ablo satisfaction of my superior offlc
ers, I shall be happy, all carpors to
tho contrary notwithstanding. I trust
that my errors will bo orrora of tho
head and not of tho heart.
With assurance of great rospoct
and with kindest regards to all In
terested, I romaln,
Yours vory truly,
EDWIN O. WOOLEY, Jr.

AMERICA'S ELECTRICAL

Everything in Readiness For a Week's
Celebration in Honor of the Coun-
try's Greatest Industry Electricity.
Everywhere throughout the coun
try the celebration of America's Elec
trical wok begins today, and up to
and including December 9, evory city,
town, vlllngo and hamlet will pay
Its respects to tho greatest factor
In America's prosperity today Elec
tricity! Logan merchants are nlso
promoting an Early Christmas shop
ping week nnd have mado special
displays and Inducements to tho buy
ing public.
"Everybo'dy knows about electric
ity," thoy say; but "there's tho rub,"
everbody doesn't know ALL thoro
Is to know about electricity nor oven
a small percent of tho great prog
ress It has made In recent years.
The strides havo been so rapid that
tho ordinary person has not become
acquainted with the thousand nnd
ono electrical devices that are mod
ernizing nnd revolutionizing tho
manor of living today.
Therefore, America's Electrical
Week Is set aside as a time for all
agencies to unito to show what has
been dono by electricity nnd what
is promised by thlB modern genie
which can bo summoned on tho In
stant b ytho mero touch of a but
ton. Logan is doing its share In tho
celebration of America's Electrical
Week with a beautiful Christmas

Leonard P. Allen of Blacltfoot was
a Logan visitor yesterday. Ho says
about twenty-five per cont of "the
BUgr TbiKt.' In, this 'section are still
"all scheduled a cake baking con
tost band concorts and scores of
other features.
Prosperity Is tho twin brother or
olocfrlcity in fact, thoy go hand In
hand. Look at tho wonders of olec
trlclty In every city no moro old
sooty lamps, old rusty pumps, "sad"
irons, wash tubs and their attendant
griefs Everything Is spick and span
and progressive with a genie of tho
age to furnUh light, heat, power
to turn night into any and tho day
Into hours of pleasuro for tho work
man, the housewife, tho merchant,
tho milter, tho farmer and every
body else 'In tho satisfactory perfor
mance of tholr duties.
What 25 years moro of electrical
progress will bring, even tho Edlsons
hesitate to foreenst. Electricity is
dnly In Its infancy and onlytha aur
faco or Invention and application has
been touched. ,
When tho worfd moved more slow
ly, 50 years ago, .people did not havo
to hae tho things that electricity
now provides. Today thoro Is a vast
difference. Take away olectrlty from
tho world for Half nn hour and civi
lization would totter; mako It a week
and the world would tumblo into
chaos everything would go lo ruin,
for Jiving today without electrictly
Is as inconceivable ns living with
out eating.
