CHRISTIAWA, Norway, Dec. 2.
The Dagbladet has published an Inter
view with Ilerr Mlchaells, Oerman
minister to Norway, outlining Ger
many's point of view on tho sub
marine controversy with Norway.
The minister says In part:
"Germany cannot tolerate any
special treatment of war and mer
chant submarines by neutrals, Nor
way Is tho solo neutral which by
Kpeclal Instructions, has conveyed the
Impression of adopting the view of
the entente.
"Germany is permitted by Interna
tional law to defend herself with all
her powors against Norwegian ships
carrying contraband, which prolongs
the war: and the recent food crises In
Great Britain, France and Hussla
have shown that Germany Is on tho
right path. Germany will not be de
prived of the sharp weapon she pos
sessed In the submarine.
"On tho other hand, Germany will
always respect Norway's really diffi
cult position, and tho most we expect
of really Independent Norway Is that
nho does not treat German warfare
und German economic problems dlf
forsfjUy than those of tho enemy," i

FERRY FOR PARK
Estimate of $10,000 Prepared
for Line to Lower Potomac
Grounds.
First steps to glvn the public In
creased traffic facilities to Hast Po
tomao Park, when It Is planned to
expend $1,000,000 In providing a mam
moth park and recreation center for
tho Capital, have been taken by the
War Department.
An estimate of ? 10,000 has been pre
pared for Congress by tho department
for the Installation and maintenance
of a rerry across the Washington
channel of the Potomac to glvo direct
access to the new park from the
Seventh street line of the Capital
Traction Companv and the wharves
line of tho Washington -Hallway and
Electric Company.
To Cross Channel.
It Is planned to run the ferry from
the wharf In Water street, between1 M
and N streets, now leased by the
Washington and Norfolk Steamship
Company, to u pile wharf to be con
structed on the park side of tho
channel.
At present the park ran be reached
only by the street car line crossing
tho Highway bridge, and this re
quires n long walk to the portions of
the park which It is planned first to
Improve.
Ilrlu Only Improvement,
The Improvements thus far made In
Hast Potomac Park, which Is ull that
portion forming the peninsula cast of
the Pennsylvania railroad embank
ment, consist of a drive around the
outer edgo und soma planting in the
center.
It Is planned, however, to provide
tennis courts, baseball diamonds, nnd
other recreational facilities for use
when the ferry Is provided. Other
portions of the plsn of Improvement,
Including the mammoth stadium. J)ie
swimming and wading pools and boat
ing canal will await further appro
priations by Congress.
neady To Push Plan.
What Is Ignlflrant In the estimate
now made Is that the Improvement
has grown beyond the stage of some
thing planned for the future, to a
definite nlun 01 Imnrovement for the
present, conditioned solely on Con-.
fTessionui appropriations which war
)epartmrnt officials nro confident will
bn allowed.
The estimate for the ferry was made
by Secretary Garrison on tho recom
mendation of Col. W. W. Harts, en
gineer officer In chargo of public
buildings and grounds, who planned
tho Potomac Park Imnrovement.

The American Railways Association
Takes Decisive Steps.
Decisive steps toward relieving tho
acute freight car shortage on Middle
Western and Southern lines, which

American Hallways Association.
A general movement of empties
Westward and Southwurd from heav

ed Immediately. 'Association figures
show more than 100,000 cars ort Atlan

roads, on November 1.
In many Instances, Eastern and New
England ronda aro ordered to send to
territory where shippers are unable
to inovo materials, as. high as 20 per
cent of their own enrs, In addition to
those not owned by them.
To prevent Immediate recurrences
of car oongostlon at seaboard termi
nals, tho committee Instructed East
ern carrlocs to refuse shipments from
Interior connections which cannot Im
mediately be unloaded upon arrival at
destination.
AVestern and Southern linos were
advised to,discourago such shipments.
Thousands of cars, the commltteo Bald,
now are withheld from circulation be
cause they are virtually being used
