WOMAN
DIED
THURSDAY
Burns and Exposure Caused
Katherine Denton's Death
At Hospital.
MYSTERY LEFT UNSOLVED
Body Will Be Held Awhile
. Before Being Buried By
' The County.
Katherine Denton, the strange wo
man who was fatally burned in the
destruction of'Zion colored school
house on the Princeton road Tuesday
night, and who was taken to the
Jennie Stuart Hospital Wednesday
morning, died at 4 o'clock Thursday
morning.
As nnnounced by Dr. F. M. Stites,
who attended her, the burns she re
ceived were almost necessarily fatal,
but she would not have died so soon
but for the shock and exposure. She
walked naked five miles on a cold
night, over a new pike with bare feet,
her body covered with burns, in a
strange country and in the darkness
of a lonely country road. Horrors
crowded thick upon her and her con
dition was indeed pitiable.
She died without being able to give
any definite information about her
self. In the delirium of her last hours
she muttered what seemed to be the
words "Mother," "Louisa" or "Lu
cien." Her sufferings were intense
until deati ended them. The body
was turned over to the Waller &
Trice Co. aijdjt will be held a day or
two in an effort tolocaevthe woman's
menus. '
It turned out that she first reached
the city Monday, night jmd Lieut.
Hawkins tobkhefo Hotel Main,
where she registered as K. D. Den
ton, Evansvillc, Ind. She said she
was unmarried. She got on the early
train Tuesday morning for Princeton,
leaving here at 5:40 a. m. She must
have returned Tuesday morning, as
she went to the Hill House at 1 p. m
but did not eat dinner or register.
She was given a room, saying she
would leave on an afternoon train. In
a little while she left and as hereto
fore narrated walked seven miles '"to
the country on the Princeton road,
and when night came on took refuge
in the colored school house. During
the night the house burned down and
she escaped with her clothes on fire.
She tore off the clothing and started
on the long walk back to town nude
and suffering from fatal burns. She
was found and taken in charge after
daylight two miles from town.
She was of medium size, dark hair
and eyes and wore a small dark hat
and a long coat of a peculiar shade of
red. .She was about 35 years old and
worV glasses and seemed to be intel
ligent. She made an' attractive ap
pearance. She left $8 with Mr. Freedman at
the. Hill House, which he still has de
posited in his safe. She took her suit
case with her. All of her effects were
burned up. Some people have been
found who offered to let her ride,
but she refused all offers. She asked
to be shown the Princeton road when
she reached the forks of the Prince
ton and Cadiz roads. It is not known
that she met any one whom she knew.
She told conflicting stories of the way
she was burned. She did not make
lit clear that she was in the school
house, but there is no doubt that she
received the burns there. The school
house had no fire in it, but she must
have started one.
The worst burn was on her left
shoulder. Other bad ones were un
der her arms, on her neck and faco
and in the palms of her hands. Less
serious burns were on her legs down
almost to her ankles. The soles of
her feet were terribly cut and bruised
from walking on the pike. Nothing
that would havo thrown any light on
her identity has been found. All of
the unfortunatewoman's effects were
destroyed aiwshotold nothing that
would establish her identity. Unless
the body is called, for sc-ot it will be
bttrted at, the county's expense.

tian church at 7 o'clock Thursday
evening to take part in the" communi
ty singing as arranged for by the

as llie btar bpangled uanner.
"Dixie" "Old Kentucky Home,"
"Last Rose of Summer," "Silver
Threads Among The Gold" and
many others that the big crowd sang
with zest and genuine delight to ev
erybody. Several short speeches
were made between the songs.
Prof. L. E. Foster made the first
talk, explaining the purposes of the
community singing and expressing
the hope that there n'ould be frequent
repetitions.
A. H. Eckles, as a member of the
Christian church, extended a cordial
greeting and then discussed' the ob
jects and aims of the Civic League in

and iokes that ereatly delighted his
hearers. His subject was the "Pre

The next speaker was Chas. M.
Meacham, whose subject was "Inter

lighter vein, he paid a tribute to the
excellent and praiseworthy work
done by the Civic League since its
organization in 1910. Since that time
the Presidents have been Mrs. Ira L.
Smith, Mrs. Frank K. Yost, Mrs. W.
R. Howell, Mrs. F. P. Thomas and
Miss Jennie Glass. Special objects
of their attention have been the pro
motion of the Carnegie Library, the
organization of Associated Charities,
a crusade against flies and for public
sanitation, the enforcement of laws
and ordinances demanding pure food
and a clean town, and persistent ef
forts to arouse the civic pride and
tastes of the citizens for the cultivation
of the flowers aod in other ways
beautifying the city..-
Taking as his subject "The Inter

of his characteristically happy and
eloquent speeches, paying a high
compliment to the musical talents of
the Wednesday morning club.
The closing speaker was T. C. Un

as a "Postlude" was a continued
round of humorous and graceful
things, said in the speaker's happiest
and most pleasing style.

RUMANIAN CAPITAL LOST
nvaders Overrunning Coun
try Without Serious Rer
sistance.
London, Dec. 1. The forces of
icld Marshal von Mackonson are al
most within shelling distance of the
southern forts which protect Bucha
rest, the capital of Rumania. Driving
along the railroad leading .north from
Giurglu, von Mackensen has captur
ed the town of Tzomano, 16 miles
sntth of Bucharest, and at last ac
counts was slill making progress to
wards his objective.
Meanwhile the army of Gon von
Falkenhayn is keeping up its pressure
against the Rumanians west and north
west of the capital, in the center, hav
ing forced the Rumanians to fall back
to Glavatziotzu, 35 miles from Bucha
rest, and farther north having cap
tured the town Campulung, thus oj
ening the way for the unhindered ad
vance of additional troops of the cen
tral powers through the Torzbun;
pass into Wallachia.
The offenstvc begun by the Rus
sians in the region of Kirlibaba appar
ently is not impeding to any extent
the TeutDiiic inroads into Rumanian.
Additional gains are conceded to the
Russians in this region, but again it is
asserted that they have been dearly
paid for in casualties. The Ruma
nians in the north and northwest
fronts have made progress in the Bu
zeu and Prahova valleys.
In none of tiie other theaters has
there been any fighting of great in
tensity, so far as the official reiorts
show. The big guns of the belliger
ents on the front in France and Bel
gium are active at several points.
