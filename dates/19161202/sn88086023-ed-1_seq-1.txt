3 MONTHS RAINFALL
A
Total Deficiency of September, Octo

Average Is 840.
The rainfall for the months of Sep
tember, October and November hna
been considerably below the normal,
according to records kept by E. F.
Averill, official observer. The defi
ciency amounts to 1.31. The nor
mal rainfall for the three months is
J. 69 whereas the actual rainfall has
been 2 28 Inches.
The total precipitation for Novem
ber was 1.S8 Inches as against l.H

ber was .68 against I. It normal, and
that for September Was .22 as against
.89 normal. However, the deficiency
for the fall months was even greater

a surplus.
The highest temperature recorded
In November was on the 3rd when the
mercury reached 78. The lowest was

The association went on record as
favoring a change In the deer limit
law. Most of those present favored
reducing the limit to any one hunter
during a season to two bucks, while
others thought that a two-limit
should permit hunters to kill either
bucks or does.
Discuss Closing of River.
The most heated discussion of the
evening was over the proposal to
close the Umatilla river and Its trlbu.
tarles for a year to permit of restock.
Ing. W. N. Matlock nl Denn
Shtill favored the move which would
leave only Camas creek, the Walla
Walla river and tributaries and But
ter creek above Echo as the only
streams In which anglers could fish
next yeor. Marlon Jack suggested It
might be feasible to close the tribu
taries but not the river Itself. How
ever, the majority sentiment was
against the move, the contention be
tng that It would not prove practi
cable. There was also discussion as to
changes In the slxe limit and basket
limit of trout but the association fi
nally decided to make no recommendations.

treasurer; and the following direc
tors, J. W. Maloney, Mrs. A. F. May,
