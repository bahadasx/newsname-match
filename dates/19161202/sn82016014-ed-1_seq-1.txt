Athens. Dec. 2. The Kins of
r.reece has agreed to Rive up the ar
tillery demanded by Admiral DuFour
net. The allied troops are withdraw
ing from Piraeus.
An entent" diplomat informed the
Associated Press correspondent that
Admiral DoFournet expected to with
draw his troops after King Constan
tine agreed to surrender six batteries
of mounted artillery to the allies. The
nllied forces air. ady are leaving the
Zappeion. only 300 remaining as a
guard The French legation, which
was guarded by French marines, was
fired upon during the crisis. The
Greek military authorities assert that
the firing was done by rowdies.
Secretary liridgman of the British
le-ntion was arrested in the street by
a Greek patrol and taken to a police
station, where he was instantly re
leased. Hold Conference With Allies.
On the intervention of the Span
ish and Dutch ministers, the entire
cnbinet and the entente diplomats
met at the French legation at 8
o'clock this evening to discuss the
pus. Utility of an agreement. An ar
mistice was finally arranged and the
firing ceased. The number of casual
tils is not known but many civilians
are l.-nown tit have been killed.
Admiral DuFournet landed some 400
marines at an early hour and marched
tcvard Athens, seizing Philopappas
hill overlooking the city. The Greek
guards on all roads leading to the
capital lefused to permit a second ma
rine detachment to advance further.
A 11 trams between Athens and Piraeus
wrie stopped and no carriages were
permitted to enter the city.
Seize Building Xcar Palace.
In Athens there was intense excite
ment. Women carrying Joads of pro
visions hastily bought in anticipation
of a siege thronged the streets above
those in which the bullets were flying.
Old men with hunting guns on their
backs mounted guard at the street
corners so as to release the soldiers'
for the fighting outside.
Four hundred British marines rein
forced the French force in Zappeion,
the fitmous indu.?trial exhibition build
ing which lies at the south side of the
grirlen of the royal palace. From
tin- surrounding hills Greeks poured
bullet into the Zappeion. The allied
forces appeared to be acting under a
preconceived military plan, which was
intended to spare the city as much as
possible
The encounters between Greek and
allied troops followed meetings at
three different points in the outskirts
of the city. Many casu .lties resulted.
With the city's population terror
stricken, all shops are closed and the
street railways have suspended opera
tion. Agrees to Withdraw Troops.
London, Dec. 2. Armistice has
been effected between allied troops
and Greek reservists at Athens. A
Reuter dispatch from the Greek cap
ital today asserted that King Con
stantine had agreed to delivery of six
mountain batteries to the allies.
In return it was said Admiral Du
Fournet agreed to withdraw allied
troops from the city, pending refer
ence of the agreement to the allied
governments.
London regarded this dispatch as
indicating a clearing up in the admit
tedly tense situation brought about by
initial refusal of the Greek govern
ment to acquiesce in DuFournet's de
mand for disarmament of Greece.
This refusal was marked with san-
guinarv clashes between allied troops
and Greek reservists, according to
dispatches dated Friday and received
here early today. There were en
counters at three points in the out
skir s of the city. A veritable panic
seized upon the residents of the Greek
capital.
Greek Cabinet Reverses Decision.
Not only were there open outbreaks
of fighting in the outskirts of the city
between reservists and allied troops
mostly French sailors but dispatches
said there had been lively street fus
illades exchanged between members
of the royalist and Venizelos factions
the clashes in some instances occur
ring in the heart of the city.
If official advices later confirm the
decision of King Constantine to sur
render six mountain batteries at such
a partial acquiescence in Admiral
Fournct's demands will be complete

"TO KILL WILSON"
Man
Flashing Knife Starts
Panic at Depot.
Intended to Meet President's
Train at Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, Dec. 2. Crazed by
drink, a man flashing a large carving
knife with which he said he would
kill President Wilson as he passed
thru here this afternoon, attacked a
pedestrian in Reading terminal, sent
hundreds of travelers fleeing to safety
and engaged three policemen before
he was overpowered and arrested.
He gave his name as Jonathan
Kraus, no home, when finally over
powered. The man appeared before the pres
ident's train arrived here at 1:30
o'clock but made a mistake in sta
tions. Matted hair flowed over his shoul
ders and he continually muttered to
himself. Suddenly he drew the knife,
leaped upon a man leaving the station
and shouted:
Chases Man for President.
"You're the president! I shall kill
you.'
Dropping baggage and hat, the
stranger went down the steps three at
a time, his - assailant close behind.
Women and children rushed in all di
rections, screaming for help.
Three reserve policemen leaped
upon the man, but he fought for ten
minutes before handcuffs could be ad
justed. "I prayed on the steps of this city
hall," he said, ''before I started out
on my mission to kill Wilson."
Physicians will examine him.
"I'll get him yet." shouted Kraus, as
he was led to a cell, "and J. P. Mor
gan, Rockefeller and all those fel
lows. They're keeping the cost of liv
ing high and the war going."
ON "RAGGED EDGE"
Carranza's Northern Army Is in
Pesperate Position.
Villa Is Expected to Evacuate
Chihuahua City Soon.
El Paso. Tex- Dec. 2. That the sit
uation of the Carranza government in
northern Mexico is "desperate" fol
lowing the capture of Chihuahua City
by Villa, was the admission made to
day to friends, of General Gonzales,
commander of the government forces
at Juarez
"If Villa attempts to hold the north
ern capital," Gonzales said, "we will
be able to converge from three sides
with heavy forces and annihilate the
bandit's army. But indications are
that Villa is making ready to move
again. We have his channel of es
cape toward the south closed with our
troops at Horcasitas."
With their disorganized forces scat
tered over the state of Chihuahua,
Mexican government military leaders
today are awaiting Villa's next move.
Refugees arriving at the border de
clared that the bandit forces were
preparing to evacuate Chihuahua City
two days ago. Two trains were made
up at the Mexican railway station in
the capital and quantities of loot and
supplies for the bandit army were be- 1
ing loaded
Several pieces of artillery
were taken from Santa Rosa hill and
loaded up on flat cars.
At the Mexican consulate here it
was declared the movements of the
remnants of General Trevino's com
mand after the flight from Chihuahua

Xo News of Americans.
Early today United States depart
ment agents here said the situation in
regard '.o the safety of the six Ameri
cans known to have been in Chihua
hua City at the time of the attack,
was ominous. Lack of news of their
fate for an entire week since the
evacuation of the city by Carranzistas
is looked upon as portentous. The
government agents question every
refugee and officers of the Mexican
government forces arriving at the bor
der for news of the Americans and
other foreigners, but the only news
was that a group of Americans, in
cluding George Brittingham, was seen
standing beside the railroad track
begging for admission to refugee
trains. The only hope remaining is
that the men may have' fled to the
hills or with Trevino to the southeast.
Military officials here point out that I
v uia will probably move westward
along the line of the Mexican North
western railway after evacuation of
Chihuahua City, in order to reorganize
his forces and prepare for another
swoop. All military authorities agree
it would be almost impossible for the
bandit forces to hold the city against a
determined assault unless they were
well supplied with artillery and am
munition. Search for Villa sympathizers among
the Juarez garrison was begun today,
when it was discovered that all guns
hrought north were disabled en route,
the breech locks having been re
moved. Fears of an immediate bandit attack
upon Juarez were lessened by reports
of preparations for evacuation of Chi
huahua City by the bandit army.

London, Dec. 2. Russia is striking
with a giant's force the blows which
it is hoped will smash the Teutonic
ring of steel gripping Rumania, Dis
patches today indicated no let-up in
the terrific offensive launcned by the
czar's legions in Dobrudja and south
west Bukowina.
The flanking movement directed at
the Japlonitza pass is the most Beri
ous menace to German positions in
Rumania.
Apparently Russia has poured a
mass of men into the effort to aid
Rumania. It is conceded that the
Teutons must meet this menace to the
flanking movement in Bukowina with 1
a large number of defenders. This
Russian offensive covers a distance of
more than 2 50 miles. " I

BLAME UNCLE SAM i
Embargo Along Border Handi
caps Carranzista Army.
Stop Arms Shipments Fearing
Villa Would Get Them.
Washington. D. C, Dec. 2. The
American embargo on shipment of
arms across the border promised today
to become a live issue between this
government and Mexico.
Carranza's advisers here secretly are
displeased at the United States regu
lations which, they claim, in practice
(tho not theory) prevent Carranzistas
and Villistas from getting shipments.
The Mexicans say frankly a lack of
ammunition was solely responsible for
the defeat at Chihuahua City. On the
other hand American officials hint
that the Carranzistas have sufficient
ammunition but that the Villistas
have wrested it from them.
Might Prove Boomerang.
As the embargo now stands, this
government can make exceptions for
passage of shipments. In practice,
however, this is rarely done, for fear
such shipments may fall into bandit
hands and prove a boomerang.
It was learned zoday thaf Ambassa
dor Arredondo has called the situa
tion to the attention of Secretary of
State Lansing.
The administration, however, gave
no evidence of planning an alteration
of its rules, tho if it could be assured
that the munitions would be used in
the Villa campaign it probably would
permit freer shipments.
"The Chihuahua City situation still
perplexes authorities, especially as
their information to date consisted
solely of reports and "rumors." Per
sons in close touch with conditions,
however, made no secret of their
anxiety for "possibilities" in northern
Mexico.

Over to Lloyd-George.
London, Dec. 2. Cabinet changes
involving the resignation of Premier
Asquith are predicted by the Man
chester Guardian in an article in to
day's issue on the current rumors re
specting political changes. The paper
says:
"Rumors, perhaps one ought to say
more than rumors, are going around,
the-current, jumor being that Bonar
Law may replace Premier Asquith for
"the time being, but that a final settle
ment would be Lloyd-George as pre
mier." The Guardian concludes that the
coalition government has not the pres
tige to resist 'the attacks being made
upon it and that the house of com
mons has reached the mood In which
it is ready to create another ministry.
Sudden Political Crisis.

crisis has suddenly arisen and that the
coalition government is likely to go.
According to this paper a new war
council, probably consisting of Premier
Asquith. Lloyd-George, Bonar Law,
Arthur Balfour and Sir Edward Car
son will be appointed.
Another rumor that David Lloyd
George was packing up his belongings
in his office as minister of war was
printed in the London Evening News
today in support of the report that he
was preparing to leave that post.
A number of London newspapers to
day declared the coalition cabinet
faced a crisis likely to result in its dis
solution. There has been consider
able popular dissatisfaction against
Premier Asquith expressed in editor
ials recently.

LIFT "STOCK EMBARGO
Kansas City Stockyards Again Open
to Kansas Cattle.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 2. An order
to remove the embargo on shipments
of livestock from the Kansas City
stockyards was received from Wash

the South St. Joe stockyards.
The embargo was put on a week

Removal of more than 6,000 head
of cattle, held in quarantine yards at
Kansas City, will be one of the prob

at a conference of state an frfa ,1
uiiiuims in jiansas City. Joe Mercer,
Kansas state livestock sanitarv com
missioner, left this afternoon for Kan
sas City to attend the conference.
"There is no order against ship
ments," said Mercer, "altho there will
be little shipping to markets until
quarantines are removed. Our prob
lem now is to release the 6,000 cattle
in the Kansas City yards. The only
embargo facing shippers at this time
is one which may of necessity be en
