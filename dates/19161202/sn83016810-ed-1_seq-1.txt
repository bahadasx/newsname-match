Seattle, Wash.Girl elevator opera

en Europe, but they certainly are*an
oddity in Seattle,-theJlrst one to this
xsity being Miss Beryl Smithson, eleva
tor conductor in the Eitel building at
Second and Pike, Seattle's busiest cor

Npt only is Miss Smithson's employ
ment unusual for a girl, but all in all
she is remarkable in other ways for a
girl still in her teens. Few people
know that the automobile she drives
to and from her work is her own and
was saved out of her very own sav-

ings, every penny of it. It's unusual
for even male elevator operators to
run their own automobiles.
"I have always wanted to run an
automobile, and after I learned to
manage one it was my ambition to own
one. I simply decided I could own
one if I set to work to do it Now I
own one, and it wasn't very hard work
to save for it either. But I don't see
why you or anybody else should be so
concerned about it or wonder at it.
Anyhow, it doesn't interest anybody."
This was the snappy though not un
kindly reply which the busy little ele
vator girl made to the reporter's in
quiry.
"Don't you think it is rather a re
markable achievement for a young wo
man who is earning her way?" asked
the reporter, who never could under
stand how anybody ever managed to
save any money, no matter how much
or how little he made.
"No I don't think it is so remark-
able," said Miss Smithson. "I think
any young girl with a little grit and
determination can do that It isn't so
hard to save a part of what you make
if you simply try."
"Well, how did you do it Miss Smith-
son?"
"I just made up my mind to save as
much money as I could as soon as I
began to earn wages. I didn't begin to
save money just for this automobile.
I first began to save for emergency
for a rainy day, as they say. If 1
should say it wasn't hard work that
wouldn't be true. It was hard at first
I had to sacrifice some things that I
liked and wanted, but were not abso
lutely necessary. I just didn't buy
some things that other girls do and
that only please for a little while.
Then I watched prices on things, and.
while i decided to buy the best, of ev
erything I had to buy, I thought twice

Kan.A big tooth, ^nve
whic* is supposed have come from
the jaw of some mastodon spf prehis
toric ages, has been unearthed! by Tl E.
Nichols of this city by men employed
in making a deep cut on Diamond
creek, a mile arid a half northeast of
Elmdale. The trench had been sunk
to a depth of fifty-three feet and had
passed through an eight foot gravel
strata when the big tooth was found.
A soapstone formation was encounter
ed just beneath it.
The toothfir Well preserved*, It
weighs over three pounds, measures
a foot and three inches in circumfer
ence around its base and is three
Inches in height from its base to the
points of the tooth. It Is oblong in
shape, its'"width being three and a
half inches. There are six flanges or
points to the tooth, which extend up
ward in regular pairs. The tooth has
twojarge roots, there being about three
or four inches of the root Intact, but
the lower parts are broken off. It is
believed the tooth belonged to a car
nivorous, or flesh eating, animal be

only a few feet away was uncovered
by another workman. It is a large
flat, round shaped bone, which resem

FAITHFUL DOG'S BARKING
CALLS FATHER TO CHILD
Little One, Playing to Pasture,
Where It Strayed, Kicked
by Horses.
Wheatland, Wyo. G. F. Harold's
little son, Alvin, two and a half years
old, was kicked in the head by a horse
the other day, his skull was fractured
and other severe wounds, seemingly
sufficient to cause death, were sus
tained.
The father's attention was called to
the child by the frantic barking of the
farm dog, and upon Investigating he
found that the dog was guarding the
insensible form of the little boy from
a bunch of horses in the pasture where
the little fellow had wandered in his
play.
The child's forehead was crashed,
the nose broken and the eye laid open
by the flesh being all torn from it. As
he was still alive he was rushed to a
hospital with all possible speed. The
surgeon performed a very delicate op
eration, lifting the broken bones into
position and sewing the torn skin
around the eye back Into place, and at
present writing the little fellow is get
ting along nicely and gives promise of
complete recovery.
That he was not instantly killed is
probably due to the fa,ct that the
horse's hoof struck a glancing blow,
and that he lives at ail is because there
was a skillful surgeon available.
SISTERS EARN $2,400.
Set New Agricultural Record Raising
Cabbages.
Greensburg, Pa. Tour Westmore
land county young women, daughters
of Mr. and Mrs. G. H. Smith, near
Ruffsdale, have established a new agri
cultural record In the yield and profits
to be derived from a two acre plot of
cabbage.
The Misses Smith, the eldest of
whom is eighteen, now have a bank
account of $900, with accounts due
from Pittsburgh commission men
amounting to |900, and a quarter of
their cabbage yet remains to be cut
and marketed. Buyers estimate the
value of the entire field at about 2,-
400.
Early last spring Smith turned the
two acre plot over to his daughters,
telling them to make any use of it they
desired. The girls, after closely scan
ning the market reports for weeks, de
cided to grow cabbages. They set about
18,000 plants.
KILL WHITE FACED IBIS,
Kansas Hunters Were Muzzled, but Pro-
"V feasor Solved the Problem.
Topeka, Kan.A party of hunters
were near Stafford when a long1
legged
bird, which looked like a crane and
flew like a duck, suddenly rose and
started toward Oklahoma.
Six guns spoke at the same time.
The bird gave up the southern trip.
The men did not know What they had
killed. They guessed everything from
a mud hen to a wild turkey.
George Stansfleld made a secret trip
to Lawrence and conferred with some
of the professors. They labeled the
kill a white faced glossy ibis, a species
of waterfowl very rare in Kansas. The
coloring is very delicate and"changes
continually. It is one of the snipe fam

Official Refused to Accept.
Findlay, O. Philosophers for cen
turies have attempted to analyze the
conscience of the human race^ and what
prompts.it, but have been unsuccessful.
That such a thing does really exist,
Charles P. Smith, general manager of
the Toledo, Bowling Green and South

Recently he was sitting in his office
when two men walked in and each
threw a fifty cent piece oh his desk, ex

That was because they were compelled
to stand most of the way. During all

Mr. Smith refused to take the money,
but Dr. J. P. Baker, head of the As

the money for that purpose.
DEER ATTACKS POSTMAN.
Herd Within Three,Miles of Pennsylva-

Huntuigtbn, Pa.-Clark Smith, the
oldest rural route agent attached to the
Huntington postofiice, met with a spir
ited attack from a big buck deer while
on his return trip a few evenings ago
within three miles of this place.
A herd of six does led by a large
buck, had been feeding in a mountain
meadow and were about to emerge into
the open highway just as Smith was
driving leisurely past.
His horse, a calico colored bronco,
seemed to have aroused the ire of the
buck, which leaped a fence and at
tacked the bronco by rearing up and
endeavoring to strike it with its fore
feet' Mr. Smith used his whip vigor
ously on the deer. The bronco took
fright and finally drew itself and
driver to a place of safety.
A-herd of ten deer, Including one elk,
has been seen, by a farmer at the
further end of Smith's route.

Altoona, Pa. George Meritts of
Pranklinville, Huntingdon county, toss

mare and dreamed of rattlesnakes. In
bed with Meritts was Samuel Alley of
the same place.
When Meritts came to himself he still
believed himself dreaming, for a hid
eous rattle sounded in his ears. Alley
also heard it.
The frightful whirr maintained a
steady cadence, and both men were
then aware that a rattlesnake was in
their rooni. Having no light handy,
the men were imprisoned In their bed
for some time.
Finally a match and lantern were
procured. The snake, more than three
feet long, with seven rattles and a but
ton, was coiled in.the center of,the
floor. It was killed.

CHINESE HAVE PLAN TO
RID HOUSE OF GHOSTS
Urge Novel Method of Taking Haunt
From American Legation.
Washington.A legend has gone
around Peking that the American le
gation is haunted that the shade of an
officer who lost his life during the
Boxer massacres of white men in 1900
is in the habit of occasionally visiting
his old quarters In the legation, greatly
to the discomfort of the occupants.
This aroused considerable interest
among the Chinese in Peking. Their
own spooks, being daily or rather night
ly companions, do not excite much at
tention. But a foreign ghost is quite a
new thing. A Chinese gentleman named
Hsu Nai Hsuan has taken the matter
seriously to heart and has felt moved
to write to the American minister ex
pressing his sympathy for the afllictlon
the legation is undergoing in the
matter of a haunted room.
He says that experience has shown.
In China that the way to rid a house
of ghosts is to remove the roof of the
building, leaving the interior of .the
room exposed to the sun and air for
some tens of days, after which the
roof may be restored and the ghost will
no. longer frequent the place. Mr. Hsu
said that he humbly offered this sug
gestion, "as foreigners may not be fa
miliar with the proper method of han
dling ghosts in China."
If congress, says the Tokyo Adver
tiser, is asked to appropriate a sum for
the reroofing of the legation, at Peking
the American people will now under
stand what it is all about
FINDS HIDDEN ROOMS
IN HOUSE OFMYSTERY
Carpenter Work on Old Place Re
veals Apartments None
Knew About.
Chicago.At 3624 Ellis Park is an old
three slory frame building that was a
home when Ellis park was a woodland.
For the last eight or nine years, in a
remodeled form, it has been an apart
ment building.
A few days ago a carpenter, tearing
away old planking to build a porch,
broke through a wall and made discov
eries which made 3624 Ellis Park a
house of mystery.
Between the second and third floors
he found a hidden apartment, of which
not even John Chamales, new owner of
the building, knew. Carefully Prank
Wilder, the carpenter, entered through
the hole he had made in the wall.
He found a complete set of rooms
running from the front to the rear of
the building. The walls and ceiling
were unfinished. There were no win
dows and no visible means of exit
There was a small table In one corner
with a few dishes on it and an old cop
per lamp. Rust covered, but with a
frying pan of ancient days still on it
there was a stove. Some straw in a
corner seemed to indicate where the
mysterious occupant of the mystery
chamber had slept
A piece of wire between, two walls
served as a hanger for an old coat
Over everything was a thick layer of
dust
In hunting for an exit Wilder came
upoh a panel in the wall fastened with
a hinge, two big iron hooks and a bar
that fitted into iron clasps. It opened
upon the staircase and so matched the
paneling that it was invisible from the
outside.

MIKE HICKEY TELLS
OF HIS REFORMATION
Ex-Pickpocket, With Twenty
Years' Prison Record, Talks
tor 400 Men.
Mike HIckey, once a notorious pick
pocket, with a record of nineteen and
a half years behind prison bars, told
400 men at the Harlem branch Y. M.
C. A., New York, how he straightened
out and how other inhabitants of the
underworld could be helped to do the
same.
Mike's career as a thief lasted until
about four years ago. when he wan
dered, fresh from Sing Sing, into the
Cremorne mission, on Thirty-second
street It.ended there. Now he is night
man at the Bowery Y. M. C. A. and
passes his spare time helping his old
pals from Dannemora aiid Sing Sing
to get their feet on the "straight and
narrow."
The trouble with the newly emerged
convict, he said, was the old storyout
into the world with a $10 bill and a
wish to keep straight a job until a cop
told the boss of his record, then no
more job broke one more trick to get
money to eat caught, and back to
prison.
What the convict needs is a bit of
belief and encouragement when he
starts to reform, said Hickey, adding
that more and more the employers are
beginning to give this, so that many
men with long records as criminals are
now taking their places in honest life.

NEWEST BULLET.
Claimed It Pierces the Thickest
Kind of Armor.
LEAD COVERING DOES IT.
Fired From Regulation Army Rifle, It
Will Penetrate Three-Quarter Inch
Steel Plate and Other Objects Beyond.
Could Go Through Thirty Men In
Row.
New York.A new bullet, capable of
piercing armor as thick as that which
covers the famous British "tanks" or
that used In making trenches on the
Semme bomb and bullet proof, has
been invented and tested by the ord
nance corps of the United States
army. The bullet is of only 30 cali
ber but fired from the regulation
army rifle, it will penetrate a three
auarter inch steel plate and other ob
jects beyond.
It is said that the bullet would be
able to pierce from twenty to thirty
men in a row. It has been tested
severely at the Sandy Hook proving
BBIOADIBB OENBBAIi CROZIEB, CHIEF OF
OBDNAKCB, U. 8. A.
grounds by the ordnance corps, and
the statements published concerning
its efficacy are the results of actual
trials.
It has taken many months of ex
perimenting to develop the bullet,
which is exactly like the ordinary bul
let hi appearance, but has an outside
covering of lead around the armor
piercing center of steel. This lead
casing acts as a lubricant In passing
the bullet through the steel and Is
ripped from the steel core as the bul
let passes through a solid obstruction.
Only a small number of the bullets
have been manufactured, and these
were made entirely in government
shops. Fifty ordnance and engineer
corps officers were present when
these were used in the first tests. A
three-quarter inch steel plate about
forty feet long and twelve feet wide
Was erected, and behind it were fixed
six silhouette targets In thesemblance

A detail of men from the coast artil
