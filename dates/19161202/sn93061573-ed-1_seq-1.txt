"An impressive feature of the rnn
t I'ilnitions up lo date is that- many
;:re form citizens who are under no
obligations lo the pa,vty for any
past political favors,'' conlinued Mr.
.Marsh.
"They strikingly express the deep
feeling of prat iludo over the re
election of President Wilson enter
tained iy independent citizens
I hrniighout the country. They are
in a sense thank offerings by Amer
ican voters who feel hoth pride and
honor in (he opportunity of thus

contriliutions from citizens upon
whom we had no claim in a parly
sense are. of course, very pleasing
I o us.
"When in the closing days of the
campaign, however, the party man
agers pledged the national commit
tee's credit, in a dotorminod effort
to make a final and resolute stand
against the devices of the organized
wealth which sought (o turn the ad
mittedly genuine drift, away from
President Wilson, we relied and had
a right tu rely upon the groat body
of )omocrats in the nation to finan
cially back u.s up.
".Naturally, we now look to these
I irniorras. w ho, in a party sense,
share in the honors of the wonderful
victory, to make it dourly known by
their prompt and (.'onerous response
that futuro' democratic national
committees, if ever confronted by
the menace of coerciyo wealth and
Republican unscrupulousness, as we
were, may rely upon the parly to
support thorn lo tho limit in com
bating the powerful influences of
the opposition. J
"In other words, let the messago
go forth that the great rank and file
of Democracy stands behind its party
managers ready and eager to sup
port to tjie utmost their parly's
patriotic refusal to be either dismay
od or intimidated by the mere power
of organized wealth.
"We are grateful indeed to those
Democrats who have already re
sponded with generosity and prompt
ness. We are grateful also to the
tho army of workers in the field
who labored with efllciency arid tire
less energy during the campaign.
"Thero aro thousands of Demo

not yet heard. To them as to all

The former pivcrnnr loured the

asked for no voles for himself, but
urged the people to voto for the

against Itursum and llubhell.
In oilier words, Otero was rham

his own candidacy for slate auditor.
Though defeated for the otlice of
