i Great Teutonic Drive on Capital j j
of Rumania Checked by Russians
London, Dec. 2, 4:25 p. m. A Reuter despatch from Petrograd says the Russians have gained a footing in the town of Kirlibaba and that desperate street fight-
ing is in progress. German troops occupying the houses are defending them to the last extremity, the despatch says, and reinforcements are being concentrated in the west- I
ern parof the town for a counter attack. The town of Kirlibaba controls one of the most important passes in the I
Huge Force of Russians
i Pressing a Great Offensive
Along Rumanian Frontier
I Two Enormous Flanking Operations in Progress Russians Trying to
Save Bucharest-Teutonic Allies Attempting to Force Evacuation .
and Cut Off Defenders.
Wt In dications point to the probability
that two flanking operations on a
31c large scale are in progress on the Ru
manian front. The one apparently is
intended by the Russians to 1 save
King Ferdinand's armies and possibly
his capital and 'the other by the Teu
lonic allies to force the evacuation of
Bucharest and cut off the troops de
fending it.
Having assembled what seems to be
, a huge force along the range of the
lower Carpathians, the Russians are
presing a great offensive on a front
of approximately 250 miles, running
along the western frontier of the Ru
manian province of Moldavia and ex
tending northwest along the Bukowina
boder. Alreadv they, are declared, to
have scored 'such successes - as to
lead to expectations- that the supply
lines of General von Falkenhayn's
armies invading Rumania from the
north may shortly be seriously
menaced.
Great Teutonic Move.
The threat to the Rumanians comes
from Field Marshal vdn Mackensen
on the southeast. Controlling virtu
ally the entire course of the Danube
as far as Tchernavoda, as they do,
the Teutonic allies, it has been point
4 ed out, seemed likely to attempt
throwing forces across It at points
! further and further east, to outflank
each lino taken up by the Rumanians
a3 they retired under the pressure of
von Falkenhayn's forces from the
north and west and such of von Mack
V;p enson's troops as were already on the
north bank of the river.
Entente commentators point out
that such a move may now have been
effected taking the mention by Petro
, grad that hostile pntrols have ap
peared near Lake Griaka as indicating
' that a new crossing has been made
by von Mackensen near Oltenmitza,
southeast of Bucharest. An advance
from this point would hem in the
'Rumanians around Bucharest, except
to the northeast and if carried far
.; enough would altogether cut off their
retreat.
Greek Crisis Passes.
The crisis in Greece seems to have
passed for the present with the an
nouncement from Athens that King
Constantine has agreed to give up
the artillery demanded by the entente
and that the allied forces which were
landed are being withdrawn, an arm
istice hav ing been arranged. Before
this, panic had reigned in Athens,
with an exchange of fire between
; Greeks and entente marines. During
the fighting many civilians are re
J ported to have been killed.

main span of the bridge itself is only
about half a mile long, but the ap.
proaches, to the west, stretch for
several miles over the marsh lands
bordering the Danube. At last reports
the Russians, fighting their way back
southward in Dobrudja, were some fif
teen miles north of the bridge on tho
Dobrudja side. Their present seizure
of the western end of it may only
be intended to prevent Its use by von
Mackensen In throwing troops across
