RUMBRS OF NEW
RAILROADS HERE
Prosperity Wave Wakes Up the
Sleeping Rail Capitalists and
Something is to Drop
TWO OR THREE LINES
LOOKING TOWARD HERE
Division and Shops of Frisco May i
Be Had if People but Go c
After This Important t
Development e
There has been little or no rail
road construction in the Unitel
States for several years. Tight
ness of the money market and a
general stagnation in busiriess
caused its stoppage. A few years 2
ago Louisiana was almost the'f
center of the universe, so far as e
railroad building was concerned a
and many hundreds of miles of C
steel were laid within the state's
borders. Then all construction
stopped and there has been noth- h
ing doing since.
Prosperity struck the state, as
well as the rest of the union, a
few months ago and since the tl
wave there has been an awaken- o
ing all along the line. Even the ti
long-sleeping rail magnates have 'I
begun to rub their eyes and look o:
artund for more worlds to con- p
quer. The recent receivership of p
the Gulf Coast Lines (Frisco) ii
sybtem has left that young giant sa
ii a better condition than it was v
ever before and since its divorce- ti
ment from the parent system it it
is branching out in quest of busi- 1V
ness and looking to the future n
with a -view of building itself in- b
to one of the south's great rail tb
systems.
The flood last spring left it al- a
most paralyzed and a number of v
miles of its track in the Atchafa- ti
laya swamp was washed out and e
had to be rebuilt and reballasted
at a heavy cost. The work was I
accomplished in record time and.
is now one of the best road beds'
in the state. Lately rumors have I
been in circulation to the effect
that this road would rearrange its
divisions and locate its repairI
shops at a more suitable poidt on
the line midway or nearly mid- i
way between New Orleans and tA
Hbuston. Opelousas is the logi- f
cal place for the' location of the I
division and shops and if the peo- c
ple here but exert themselves,
they stand a good chance to get I
a great industry located within
our midst.
It is also said that the Santa
Fe, which has had its terminal in I
Oakdale for many years; and the
Rock Island, which terminates at F
Eunice, are both casting their
eyes toward New Orleans. In
order to reach that city these two
big and important systems will
have to build their lines fronJ
their present terminals or ar
range trackage rights with the
Frisco or other roads. It is pos
sible that the Santa Fe will build
to Opelousas and use the Frisco
tracks from this point on to New
Orleans. If this be the common
meeting point of several big
roads this will be the logical
point for a general division and
the repair shops of the group.
Let Opelousas go after these
roads, the division and shops and
if it is successful it will mean the
future upbuilding and prosperity
of this city, its people and the
surrounding territory.
Anolher rumor, long in circula
tion and which may possess some
lemnent of truth, is that Winm.
Edenborn, presidenlt and -s&e
owner of the Louisiana Railway
and Navigation ('ompany' will
huild his road south fron ,!an

George Vidrine, resident of
this city and business manager
of The Clarion, bought this week
the large farm of Mrs. Virginia
Thompson, which is located about h
one mile west of the western cor- in

place is one of the most desirable t1
in the country and consists of n
several hundred acres of land and o
well "improved. The soil is fer
tile and has been well cultivated E
in the past and is in fine shape. b
Mr. Vidrine does not intend to a
move out on the farm next year ,
but will have it cultivated by v
tenants for a share of the crop o√Ω
for ren't. The price paid was
around forty dollars per acre, s
which is, a reasonable figure, loca- o

AN OIL FIELD LIES
NEAR OUR DOOR
Developments at Pine Prairie
Stopped but Promises Good
for Future
MR. CHAMPION SAYS THE
FIELD IS A GOOD ONE
Indications are That Work Will
Begin There Again Soon, as
"Head Knockers" Were
There Last Monday
Several years ago, when the
Myles Mineral Company began
drilling in the Pine -Prairie sec
tion little attention was paid to
their operations. Several wells
were sunk but, suddenly, all work
was stopped and few were ac
quainted with the fact that sev
eral thousand barrels of oil were 1
shipped from that field.
Last Tuesday a reporter of The
Clarion accompanied Attorney M.
H. Thompson of this city on an
automobile trip to the Pine Pra
irie field. Leaving Opelousas at
11 a. m., we went thirough Ville i
Platte, arriving there at noon. A
brief stop was mate in the
Evangelitie capital and the car
hit the road on to Chicot. Turn
ing at this latter place the five
miles to Pine Prairie station on ]
the Rock Island was quickly
made and the short run to the
oil field was soon over.
The railroad was crossed at
Easton, where quite a number of
building are in evidence but few
are occupied. A sawmill tram
road runs out into the woods 1
where a mill is located near the
oil wells and the old marble
quarry. Several derricks are
still standing and of the number
of wells sunk three were pro
ducers. Two or three oil stor
age tanks were erected and a t
small pipe 'line laid to the Rock!
Island tracks. The wells were!,
supposed to have gone dry but
many believe this was but a story
told to keep down any further ,
development. When we arrived
at the wells the driller, Mr.
Champion, who put down most
of the wells, accompanied by the
watchman and several other men,
were tinkering with the pipes.
They did not admit that opera-i
tions were to begin again but Mr.
Champion admitted to the re
porter that "it was a good field."*
Every indication pointed to the
fact that the Myles company
would again start drilling, as two
of the active heads of the con
cern were on the ground last
Monday and spent the night in'3
Pine Prairie.
One of the wells still shows in
dications of gas. A rust-eaten
pipe leading from the well casing,
when touched with a lighted,
match, blazed forth for several
seconds, ,howing clearly that gas
is still coming from the depths.
The platforms under the derricks
of the three old producers are
soaked with oil and the smell
still lingers in the atmosphere.
Ruin and desolation, abandoned
machinery, dismantled and rot
ting buildings are all in evidence'
but these can quickly be cleaned
up if the company decides to
again start operations.
Leaving the scene we stopped
by the old marble quarry, which
was discovered and operated to
a small extent before the civil
war. The outcropping of stone
is visible, one great boulder jut
ting out in the excavation, while
any number of small pieces brok
en from the mother vein are scat
tered around. What the quality
Sof this marble is we are in no pos
ition to say; but we have been
told thai it is susceptible of a
high polish and therefore might
prove valuable.
The return trip followed the
trainm road to the second sawmill,
which is located on Mr. Thomp
son's land. The surrounding
seven thousand acres]is ewned by
a large syndicate, and they pnt
down a test welt just across the
creekl from the Thompson tract.
The derrick is still standing and
we were informed that oil was
struck and the well then capped.
Within a few yards of this well
is a field. lyine almost flat, but
r;sing from the low territory is
what is known as a "salt domne"
ia high bill. and this fre-k oa
naturP is said to indlieatP oil. ~ms

LOCAL NATIONAL BANKS I

Two Institutions Mark the Pros- ci

Louisiana n
The statements of the national tl
banks of this city, the Opelousas a
National and the Planters Na
tional, published in The Clarion B
last week, show an abundance of f
cash on deposit and are a remark
able record of the financial pros- to
perity of this territory. The cot
ton crop brought a flood of mcney
from other centers and this mon- s
ey has mostly remained right li
with us. The two banks in ques- tl
tion have naturally received their ti
proportionate share of the de
posits and the statements in. qes- L

SALOON MEN FILING
NOTICE OF APPLICATION
Law Requires Them to Publish s'
Formal Notice of Intenticn e'
to Open or Continue a
q
By reference to the advertis- f:
ing columns of The Clarion to- P
day it will be seen that many I
saloon men of this parish are v
either filing notice of their in- S
tention to apply to municipal or
,parish authorities for a permit a
and licenes to begin or continue "1
the operation of a saloon duringie
the year 1917. This is the re-A
quirement of the - Gay-Shattuck T9
law ,but there seems to be some w
misunderstanding relative to this .
provision of the law. Many who a
have been in business are of the V
opinion that theY do not have to ti
file notice of their intention to
apply for a permit, etc., to con
tinue their business. A few,
however, rather than run any
risk in the matter publish theirj
formal notice each year. In this
they are undoubtedly correct for
their current license and permit tl
is for but one year and it is ne
cessary to apply for a permit andt
license to continue the operation
of their business. I
Congress to Convene Monday
The short and final esssion of I
the ,present congress will convene l
next Monday and will expire by
limitation on March 4 next, the
day of the inauguration of the,
pl esident and vice president. As 1
the next congress is doubtful as t
to its political complexion in the
lower house, much important leg-i 1
islation favored by the ad!inins-:
tralion will no doubt be forced
through the present session. Sen-I
ator Ransdell has ahleady gone
to the national capital but a
newspaper report states that
Senator Broussard, acting under
advice of his physician, will not
go to the capital until some time
in January. i

ANOTHER ItUTE IS
IHLIN LN OIItLRED
Evangeline Highway May Run
From Bunkie Through
Grand Prairie
PROPONENTS CLAIM IT IS
BETTER THAN BAY. BOUEF
Would be Direct Line from Avoy
elles Town to Washington
and Also Avoid the Sticky
Soil Along the Boeuf
The Evangeline Highway,
which is the proposed connect- 1
ing link between the Jefferson c
and Spanish Trail highways, in- t
stead of coming from Bunkie s
down Bayou Boeuf, may run i]
through Grand Prairie to Wash- o
ington, thus eliminating a long t
stretch of deep sand and sticky
mud along the bayou. Propon- 1
ents of this route claim it not on- 1
ly superior but a shorter line
from the hustling Avoyelles town
to Washington and therefore
more to be considered when the t
final selection is to be made.
It is also said that besides its
natural advantages of shortness
and soil conditions it will also 1
locally serve a greater number of s
people. as the Grand Prairie sec
tion is more thicky populated
than the Bayou Boeuf section. 1
The former is a beautiful open
country, thickly studded with
farms and the ihatter of laying
out a new road or improving one
of the present roads would be a
comparatively easy job.
The general meeting of the
newly formed Evangeline High
way Association will be held in
this city on December 14, next
and it is expected that at that
time the matter of final route from Y
Bunkie to Washington will be de
finitely decided. It is generally (
supposed that from Washington b
to Sunset the rouse will follow the n
present gravel road built by the 1
pailsh of St. Landry. From c
Sunset south to the Lafayette 5
line the road is not gravelled but '
the regular road between those r
two points will no doubt be de- a
cided upon. Across the line, in P
Lafayette, that parish is-already. t
constructing a modern highway s
to the limits of the city of Lafa
yette and it is supposed that the P
road will be built up to the par- v
ish line at Bayou Carenero.
The definite route of the Jeger- f
son Highway, from Bunkie south
east, is to be decided on within t
a few days. There seems to be t
quite a contest on over two routes 9
from that town, one running
parallel with the main line of the
Texas & Pacific Railway to Mel
ville, the other going by way of .
Simmesport, thence to Bator
Rouge. Also, there seems to be
another hot contest on as to 1
whether the route will follow the 1
east bank or the west bank- of the t
1 Mississippi river to New Orleans. <
Manager Clarkson of the lig high
way will be at the Bentley Hotel,
Alexandria, tomorrow morning I
Sand within a few days following I
will begin the work of scoring
the various proposed routes.
'Auto Accident Last Week
Friday night of last week the i
automobile of Dr. Frank Shute t
Iwas somewhat damaged in a col
'lision with ahog on the Port Bar-1
re road, about thlee miles east of
the city limits. The car hit the
-hog broadside, killing same, and
ithe tire and rim of one wheel
was ripped off. The machine
veered into the ditch and partly
overturned. None of the occu
pants were injured.
