Damage From Field Fires.
--o lin
We learn that several building in
were burned near 'Pointe Claire t
this week by somne planters setting
tire to their tields and not watch.- i
ing the fire from burning over to y,
their neighbors. It seem. s to us
that no field should be set on fire
at this time utnless every precau
tion has been taken to insure that
the fire can be safely controlled.
I We hear great damage from tiree
,everywhere around here. There I
is a law to that effect and those
who are guilty of blurning othert
- peoples plroperty should be made
1to standt the consequencetlllCs.

their yield, thus reducing the loss
