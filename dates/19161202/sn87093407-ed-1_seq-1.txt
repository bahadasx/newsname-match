RUNS AMUCK TO KILL WILSON
Play Fair With
Public Schools
Seattle today faces a most unprece
dented school election. Never have
such low-down tactics been employed
to defeat a candidate for the school
board as were inaugurated Friday by a
so-called "Business Men's league,"
which has no real existence. Tele
phones were busily employed Friday
night and today by this "league" and
by women of the "upper 400 of
Seattle" with all kinds of false and
mischievous statements to accomplish
the defeat of Anna Louise Strong.
The Employers' association, for some reason,
has also injected its pernicious activity into the
campaign against her.
And why? In order to elect, if possible,
George J. Danz, president of the Hofius Steel and
Equipment Co. The election of Nathan Eckstein,
president of the board, is conceded.
The contest, then, has narrowed down to one
place on the board between Anna Louise Strong
and Danz. Who shall it be? Who can give the
PUBLIC SCHOOLS the best, undivided support?
Danz has three children, and not one attends
a public school. Two attend the St. Edwards'
parochial school at Hillman City. One is tutored
at home. Danz established the parochial school.
He spent a lot of money on it. He deserves a
lot of credit for his unselfishness in that direction.
He has done good work there.
But that only proves that his interest in educa
tional matters lies elsewhere chiefly and not in
the PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
On the other hand, Anna Louise Strong has received na
tional recognition for her devotion to public institutions of
learning and child welfare work. Her ability is beyond
dispute. The federal government employed her as an ex
pert in these lines.
Her praise is sung by such national celebrities as
Judge Ben Lindsey of Denver, author of "The Beast and
the Jungle"; by Jane Addams of Hull house, Chicago; by
Dr. Stephen S. Wise of New York, and others famous for
their public spirit.
Who will give the PUBLIC SCHOOLS the best service
— Danz or Strong?
PLAY FAIR, VOTERS, WITH SEATTLE'S PUBLIC
SCHOOLS. VOTE FOR THE BEST QUALIFIED CAN
DIDATE OF THEM ALL ANNA LOUISE STRONG.
