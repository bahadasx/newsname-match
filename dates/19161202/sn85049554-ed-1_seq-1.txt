Noell answered thkt he went towards
the Jones implement shed. He said he
heard voices «within the shed. There
were cracks In the shed, he declared,
large enough to put a fist in.
"'Did you at any time look thru that
shed and see anybody lljfht a cigar?"
"I did."' He said one of the men
lighted a cigar with a cigar lighter.
Asked as to what the light revealed to
him, Noell.declared he recognized Sen
ator Jones and Albert Jones. He also
said a light was struck several times.
"Did yoii see any other persons?" he
was asked.
"There were two other gentlemen
there," hei answered. He said he was
not acquainted with them but thought
he had since met one of the men.
MoCaull There Too.
"You may state if you are perfectly

in that shed," said Attorney Mitchell.
Noell said that he thought he did.
"Who is. the one you think you know

"W. B. McCaull," was the answer.
Noell said that when he got to the

Noell said Wllkerson's name was

one man had said, "We have got to
get rid of that of Wilkerson if
we got to kill him."
Noell said the names of Silverton and
Wlllett were mentioned as workers with

Operation on Large Scale
Intended to Save Roc

Czar's Army in Posaession of Approaoh
to Tchemavoda Bridge—Two Flank
ing Operationa on Large 3cale Be
lieved to Be in Progreaa Ona by
Ruasiana to Save Roumanian Army
and Possibly Capital, if Su-j:caful
Indications point to the prob
ability that two flanking oper
ations on a large seal4 are in prog
ress on the Roumanian front. The
one apparently Is intended by the
Russians to save King Ferdinand's
armies and possibly his capital,
and the other by the Teutonic
allies to force the evacuation of
Bucharest and cut off the troops
defending it.
Having assembled what seems to
be a huge force, the Bu-:si&ns are
pressing a great offensive on a
front approximately 250 miles, run
ning along the western frontier of
the Roumanian province of Molda
via and extending northwest along
the Bukowina bolder. Already they
are declared to have scored such
successes as to lead to expectations
that the supply lines of General
von Falkenhayn's armies from the
north may shortly be seriously
menanced.
The threat to the Roumanians
Entente commentators poirft out
that feuch- a move'raiay nftw^hja've
been effected, taking the mention
by Petrograd that Hostile patrols
have appeared near Lake Griaku
as -indicating a now crossing has
been made by Von Mackensen near,
Olttnltza, southeast dE Bucharest.
An'advance from this point would
hem irf the RoumanUns around
Bucharest, except to,the northeast,
and, ft carried far enough, would
cut oft altogether.- their retreat.
The crisis- in Greece' seems yto
have passed for" the present With
the' announcement from Athens
that King Constantino has agreed
to give up the artillery demanded
by the entente and the marines
landed are being withdrawn. Before
this, panic has reigned in Athens
with an exchange of fire between
Greeks and ententc^marines. Dur
ing the fighting many civilians
were killed.
Petrograd, via London, Dec. 2.—The
Russians have gained possession of the
western part of the Tcherqavoda
bridge across the Danube, it wftif an
nounced officially today.
South of Bucharest the Teutonic
forces have bene driven back and the
villages of Tzormana and Gostlnacl
have been recaptured.
[The Tchernavoda bridge," the only
one across the Danube for a distance
of 600 miles from the Black sea, was
taken control of by Field Marshal von
Mackensen after the defeat of the
Russo-Roumanlan army in Do^rudl*
and the capture of Constanza and
Tchernavoda late In October. Over it
passes the sole railway line directly
connecting Bucharest with the Blacljt
sea, and its oapture by Von Mackenset}

manla and Russia by this land and wa.
ter route. The main span of the bridge
Itself Is only about half a mile long, but
the approaches to the west stretch sev.
eral times over the marsh lands bor
dering the Danube. At last reports the
Russians, fighting their way back
southward'in the Dobrudja, were some
fifty miles north of the bridge on the
Dobrudja side. Their present seizure
of the western end of it may be In
tended only to. prevent Its use by V»n
Mackensen.

the Teutonic Invaders, is about Sixteen
miles south of Bucharest on the rail
road line from\Glurgul and Gostaharl

Bynkaraat in Imminent Danoar."
London, Dec. 2.—Hopes of tihe Rou
manian ability ,to save their c&pital by
making1a stand on the line of t&e Art
gechu are dwindling rapidly. The
German plan Is apparency to envelop
the Roumanians on both flanks and
endeavor to cut off the first and sec
ond Roumanian armies.
This plan Is being swiftly carried
out By the capture of Campulung the
Germans gained a new line of fiupply
and communication, thru the T« *turg
pass, which greatly, facilitates thejr op
erations. In the meantime Field Mar
shal von Mackensen continues to th?ow
forces across the Danube at different
points. The report in yesterday'# Rn*.

effected a new crossing somewhere In
