DARROW FOR
PRISON REFORM
Eminent Lawyer Perfects Plans
for Organization to Help
It Along.
Ono of tho first problems of stato
with which Govornor-Eloct Frank O.
Lowdon Is to bo confronted will bo
tho crying need of oarly and complete
prison and parolo reforms in Illinois.
Attornoy Claronco S. Darrow is per
fecting plans tor an organization to
point out tho urgency of tho situation
to tho govornor-oloct soon. A cottngo
plan of Imprisonment Is to bo sug
gested. Tho organization will bo headed by
Mr. Darrow and Mrs. Gortrudo Howo
Drltton of tho Wolfnro Loaguo. Mr.
Darrow said ho thought tho wholo
systom of prison conflnomont Is
wrong nnd that now penitentiaries, on
tho cottago plan, should bo hoadod
by n group of trained workors ablo
to study tho neods of tho Individual
prisoners. In this way, ho thinks,
many mon can bo roformod and made
Into useful citizens, Ho said:
Tho wholo systom Is entirely
wrong. A man with a peculiar twist
In his brain which loads him to com
mit crimes has no chanco to dovolop
CHICAGO,
his better nnturo, whereas under such
n systom nB wo think ought to bo
Innuguratcd many of them would bo
saved.
Tho object of tho law Is reforma
tory rather than persecutory. Tho
present organization makes It perse
cutory nnd that is tho ovll which wo
hopo to romody. Thoro Is all tho ovll
In tho world In thosowho nro out of
tho penitentiary, and there Is all tho
good In tho world in thoso who nro in
tho penitentiary. Lot us dovolop tho
good.
Mr. Darrow also attacked tho parolo
systom, but not tho members of tho
parolo board. Ho said a man without
friends, political lnfluonco or nionoy
has no chanco to gain his liberty. Ho
added:
"I do not moan by that that any
of the mombors of tho board would
tako a cent from any ono. Just tho
opposlto Is truo. Dut a prisoner must
havo somo ono to work for his Inter
ests, somo ono who can Investigate
his past, gathor tho dotnil and prosont
It to tho board so It will s,co ho Is
worthy of pnrolo.
"Thon, aftor ho Is released, ho must
bo romovod to nn environment whoro
his bottor solf will havo an oppor
tunity to expand undor tho guldanco
of thoso intorostod In him ns an Indi
vidual. Undor tho prosont mothod ho
Is pnrolod and allowed to return to
his old environment, and it Is tho
most natural thing In tho world that
ho should drift back Into his old ways,
nnd, soonor or later, roturn to tho
penitentiary.
"I roally bellovo prison nnd parolo
roform Is tho most Important work
confronting Mr. Lowdon, nnd wo In
tond to holp him."
Mr. Darrow also said ho hoped to
induco tho loglslaturo to establish a
soparato Institution for dofoctlvos,
whoro thoy would bo ablo to dovolop
and whoro thoy might bo kopt for llto
If It was found Impracticable to re
loaso thorn.

Ton votes woro lacking when tho at

Fifty out of tho nluoty-two mombors

to supposa that most of them will

It Is thon necessary for tho pro

thoy Bny thoy can do nnd thoy havo
