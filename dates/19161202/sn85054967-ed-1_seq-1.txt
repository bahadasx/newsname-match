TRAIN SPEEDS THROUGH TOWNS
MILE-A-MINUTE WITHOUT ENGINEER
EASTON, PA., No. 30.
Through the darkness of nearby
towns in New Jersey at a speed
of 60 miles an hour for more
than eight miles ran a Lehigh
Valley railroad milk train last
night before the fireman discov
ered that there was no engineer
in the cab with him. An inves
tigation revealed that Engineer
John Shaffer, 58 years old, who
lived in this city, had been
knocked from his cab by some
unknown means. His body,
badly mangled, was found beside
the track at Flagtown, N. J.
The suspicions of the fireman
THE PA TRIOT
lot, the French strategist with
the Russian army, have ordered
the majority of the population,
especially women and children,
to leave the precincts of Buchar
est fortress within five days. All
remaining persons are engaged
in military and sanitary duty.
Martial law prevails, the mili
tary authorities distributing all
food.
The town of Comana (Tso
mana), half way between Giur
giu and Bucharest, situated on
the direct railway connecting
the two cities, at a point 16 miles
to the south of the capital, has
fallen into Teuton hands. It lies
only 12 1-2 miles south of Buch
arest's outer ring of fortifica
tions. Its loss was admitted by
the Russian war office.
NEW ITALIAN SHIP
FAST AS EXPRESS
ROME, Nov. 28. Italy has
brought out one of the great
surprises of the war. While
some details are suppressed, it
has become known here that the
Tutt' Ali (All Wings), the new
battleship, on her trial trip did
800 miles at the speed of an ex
press train.
She actually traveled three
times the rate of the fastest
trans-Atlantic liner.
"During the trip," says an
officer, "we were attacked by an
enemy submarine. You would
have laughed to see the torpedo
fall several hundred yards clear
of our stern. The torpedo catch
ers which escorted us were left
far behind. In a few minutes all
we saw of them was a bit of
smoke."
BOILER EXPLOSION
FATAL TO ONE MAN
KITTANNING, Pa., Nov. 29.
—Joseph Starr, aged 60, one of
the crew of a "dinky" engine at
the Kittanninjj Iron & Steel Co.,
died in the Kittanning General
hospital from burns received last
night when the boiler of the en
gine on which he was riding
burst, James McGregor, aged 42
and William Cochrane, aged 39,
who were also on the engine
were badly scalded and McGre
gor had his right leg broken,
but neither is in a serious con
dition.
were first aroused when he not
ed that the engineer had failed
to sound his whistle at gTade
crossings. Then he noticed that
no attempt had been made to
reduce the speed of the train
through towns and he climbed
from his side of the cab to the
engineer's and discovered that
Shaffer was not at his post.
Had he not made his discovery
and stopped the train when he
did the train would have entered
the yards at Phillipsburg and its
speed as it struck the switches
undoubtedly would have caused
a bad wreck.

FOUR OF J. C. LEASURE'S
RIBS BROKEN BY A BULL
Ex-County Treasurer J. Cal
vin Leasure sustained a fracture
of four ribs and other injuries
when he was attacked by a bull
on his farm in Green township
last week. Mr. Leasure was at
tempting to drive the bull into
the barn, when the animal sud
denly attacked him. Mr. Leasure
was thrown violently to the
ground and was rendered un
conscious and did not rally for
two hours. His wife, who wit
nessed the attack, called the
farm hands to the rescue.
Although suffering from the
broken ribs and from the effects
of the shock, Mr. Leasure's con
dition is reported favorable this
week and the attending physi
cian believes that his recovery
will be speedy. Misfortune has
been a companion of Mr. Leasure
recently. About a year ago he
was seriously injured in a fall in
a local garage and was a patient
in the Indiana hospital for a
time.

INDIANA HOSPITAL AND OTHERS
MAY LOSE STATE ASSISTANCE
Medical Bureau's Failure to Approve the
Equipment Is Cause. Attorney
General Makes Ruling.
HARRISBURG, Nov. 29.—A demand made upon Auditor Gen
eral Powell, late to-day by John S. Fisher, president of the trust
ees of Indiana hospital, for payment of a state hospital appropria
tion was refused because the state bureau of medical education
and licensure had not approved the hospital's laboratory equip
ment. Mr. Powell immediately after asked the attorney general
whether he should pay or await approval.
In addition to Indiana the ruling asked will affect the follow
ing hospitals: Corry, Waynesburg, Mount Pleasant, Braddock
General, Buhl, of Sharon, Homeopathic, of Chester Co., City and
Spencer of Meadville; Ohio Valley General of McKees Rocks, Un
iontown, Shenango Valley of Newcastle, and St. Johns General
of Pittsburgh.
The medical bureau, which made inspection of 166 hospitals
receiving state aid to see if they are complying with legislative re
quirements in regard to laboratories and anesthetic departments,
made a report to the governor today in which hospital practice
in the state is criticised. The report reviews efforts to secure
standardization and notes many deficiencies. Mention is made of
hospitals failing to provide equipment demanded by the state;
admission to hospitals at rates too low to pay; lack of uniform rec
ords; duplication of hospitals where communities cannot support
institutions; lackof isolation rooms, seclusion rooms and morgues
and defects in management. It is also claimed that state emer
gency hospitals are being used for general surgical cases. Man
agers of hospitals, it is stated, made efforts to comply with re
quests in many instances, but there are some which in the opinion
of the bureau should be cut off from state aid.
BOY PLAYS SOLDIER;
MOTHER IN HOSPITAL
"I'm going to be a soldier,
mother!" Charles W. Henry, Jr.,
10 years old, paced up and down
the room in his home in North
Braddock yesterday. Then:
"Halt! aim! fire!"
He jerked his rifle to his
shoulder and pulled the trigger.
His mother, smiling indulg
ently, sank to the floor. The
boy saw blood flowing from a
wound in her right cheek. He
screamed and ran out of the
house.
Persons in the vicinity, at
tracted by the shot and his cries
found the woman had been
wounded critically, and she was
hurried to the Braddock Gener
al Hospital.
The boy had taken the 22-cali
ber rifle, which belonged to an
older brother, and was playing
with it. He said he did not know
the gun was loaded.
