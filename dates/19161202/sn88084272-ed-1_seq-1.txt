Sunk Ship a Transport?
"Washington, D. C, Dec. 2. It was
officially stated today that the ' case
of the British ship Mariana, destroyed
by a German submarine with loss of

War At A Glance
INDICATIONS point 'to the prob
ability that two flanking oper
ations on' a large scale are in
progress on the Rumanian front.
One apparently is intended by the
Russians to save king Ferfllnand's
armies and possibly his capita,
.and the other by the Teutonic allies
to force the evacuation of Buch
arest and cut off the troops de
fending it.
Having assembled what seems to
i'e a huge force along the range
uftbe lower Carpathians, the Rus--lans
are pressing a great offens
ive in a front of approximately
250 miles, running along the west
ern frontier of the Rumanian
province of Moldavia and extend
ing northwest along the Bukowina
border. Already they are declared
to have scored such successes ns
to lead to expectations that the
supplies for Gen. Falkenhayn's
armies Invading Rumania from
the north may shortly be seri
ously menaced.
The threat to th'e Rumanians
comes from field marshal von
Mackensen on the 'southeast.
Controllng virtually the entire
course of the Danube as rar as
Tchernavoda 'ae they do, the Teu
tonic allies, it lias been pointed out,
seem likely to attempt by throw
ing forces across it at points fur
, ther east, to outflank each line
taken up by the Rumanians as they
retired under the pressure of von
Falkenhayn's forces from the north
and west.
