Dillon Gives the Storage
Houses Till Monday to
Mark All Eggs
All the agencie?; having to do with
the handling of N'ew Jforh'l food ?ap?
ply were brought together yesterday
and welded into two organizations, to
crush food .peculators and cut down
the cost of the bbcobs arias of life.
The American Woman's Movement to
Conserve the Pood Supply, made up of
representative* of women's club.? and
civic bodies, which will open perma?
nent headquarter.? in New York, com?
pleted its organization during the af?
ternoon. The second enemy of high
food prices is a leag.ie of rrpresenta
of practically all of the city's
grocery, butcher and delicatessen or?
ganizations, the temporary organiza?
tion of which was brought about dur?
ing the afternoon. As yet no name
for thi? body ha.? been selected.
The programmes of the two bodies,
as outlined after their initial meetings,
include careful supervision of the
ion reel of supply of the city's food,
roneos with producers in various
parts of the country and an ener?
getic campaign in favor ef national
control of food shipment and handling
through the Interstate Commerce Com
on.
Women for Drastic Action
Women who made up the first or
ganisatiofl were so enthusiastic at the
result of their first brush with th?
neniy, which resulted in heavy
1 ?..ml-giving losses to turkcv and egg
Speculators' that they favored the most
ion. Continued reduction in
thi price of eggs, potatoes and other
Commodities of the table, ri-ports that
speculators were on the verge of a
: and the announcement of <om
John J. I>illon that he
would |"1t? the storage interests sev
to comply with th<? state

of cold storage egg all served to
increase their activity,
The a01 u ?.'.- oi tion, of which
Hi . Eugene .T. Grant, president of
the State Federation Bl Women's
? ? ted as chairman, and
Mr . L D B? the Rainy Day
secretary, held it? first meeting
in the Quarters just vacated by the
' - and Measures,
Building.
Purposes Are larreaching
Aftei conierr.ng with butchers,
grocers, delicatessen keepers, and even
farmers from neighboring states, they
issued a statement announcing that
they would work to accomplish the fol?
lowing ends:
Stoppage of all gambling In foods
on trade exchanges.
Elimination of trading In futures,
favoring jail sentences, If necessary,
to enforce the law.
Penalizing growers or shippers who
neglect or destroy mature crops,
e.thcr in the field or in shipment, in
order to affect the price of such com?
modities already on the market.
National regulation of the country's
food supply through application of
present laws by the Interstate Com?
merce Commission.
Diversion of future emigration
from the big cities to the farms.
Dlversion of munition workers to
the farming districts just as soon as
they are released from their present
employment.
i'i Organizations Involved
Twenty-sis women's organizations
were represented by the members of
the body to conserve food. Seventeen
retail organizations were represented
in the body of men who conferred with
Commissioner Joseph Hartigan previ?
ous to this meeting. The retailers made
it evident that they were in sympathy
with the big wholesaler? of food in the
city, whom they credit with making
only legitimate profits on their wareb,
1 ist that they were in accord with any
movement that would prevent the arti?
ficial boosting of food prices through
the operations of speculators.
Ceorge J. Smith, a farmer, who ?aid
he had been working his property at
Cleason. Penn., for forty-three years,
proved the most interesting source of
information to both consumers and
producers. He told of the operations
of the "gatherer.?," or ?.peculators, who

MRS. GOODE'S LIFE
STORY REVEALED
Dead "Night Court Angel"
Once a Stenographer
in New York Office
An old couple, dressed In sober black I
and of obvious respectability, late last
night identified Mary Coode, former
keeper of an illegal resort and of late
the angel of the Night Court an I the
friead ?/ fallen women, as the Mary
Elisabeth Butler whom they had
known all their lives.
She had been born, they told Thomas
Dunworth, proprietor of the under?
taking parlor, at 127 West Thirty
seventh Street, where she lies dead, n
1871, at Fort Edward. Her parents hud
died in her childhood, and Father Fits?
patrick, of Albany, had given her the
money to take a course at the Albany
Business College, and the $500 with
which she came to New Y'ork, in 1E88.
She had lived "straight," they sail,
as long as she could washing os a
stenographer for the Travellers' Insur?
ance ( ompony of this city. In 1905
ery 111 and wa.s forced to g*
Lube's Hospital for an opera?
tion. When shl cane out her job wan
gone, and she looked for a 1 mg time
for other work. Ihoy supposed ?ho
must have lost bei servo. Sha k? pt
on writing to them until 1912, Hnd they
never guessed thai their "little Mary
Elisabeth" was connected with any?
thing "that wasn't on the square."
Bequeathed Illegal Resort
Their story, told also to Father
Walsh, of the Church of the Holy In?
nocents, made it possible to pick up
the lost threads in what the public
knew of the life of "Mary Goode,"
keeper of an illegal resort, and "Mrs.
Mary Bell," friend of falien women.
After she came out of the hospital, a
woman whom she met there died, will?
ing to btiaa Butler the illegal resort
she kept. Failing to get other em?
ployment, she took up its proprietor?
ship.
She will be buried lo-day under the
name of Mary E. Bell, as she asked.
A great bunch of roses was sent yes?
terday as "A slight token of respect
to a modem Magdalene by one who
has been deeply touched by her story."
A frightened girl Just come from
Blackwelr? Island yesterday appeared
at the lodging house where for
four years Mary Coode had never
failed to help girls of her kind. She
sobbed, and said that she didn't know
to whom she could turn when she wa?
told that Mary Coode hBd died.
"My mother wouldn't let me go back
homo, thtugh Mrs.. Coode got the
priest to go BSStSte IS SOB her," the
girl said. "So she got the judge to send
me to the City Hospital until my babv
was born. It livr-d just an hour, and
I've been discharged from the hospital,
and Mary Coode said tbat I was to
come here to stay till I found work."
Treasure* Woman's Letters
The girl produced a little package
of the tear-stained and much-creased
letters she had re:eived from Mary
Coode while she w?s in the hospital. |
"If your baby lives, you will h?ve
something to live for, something to
love," one note said. "Every one in
the world need? some one to think for."
"Don't feel bashful to ask me for any?
thing within my means," another road.
"Ash the Lord to give me some good
In the world before He takes me.
Mother Mary, pity rae."
A police officer, according to the i
girl's story, had sent her to a place
that had just been raided when she
s?ked for the address of a hotel. Mary
Coode had taken the matter up, and
had prom'sed bar that the officia:?
?r.nuld be "terribly punished."

Royal II. We';, r. ?iasiaUni Diatrtei A?

was started, three yean ago, he had
turned liOO automobiles to collect in?
surance, and had wrecked almost as
many cars for the aanie purpose, In
addition, Btrobel aid, h" bad arranged
.scores of fake accidents on which he
collected large inritmn.ty.
"In fact," he told Mr. Weiler,
cent of the business was of this char?
acter, and fr. three \ears the Moon

J-IO.uno and 180,000. Ir. that time It

Strobel said hi- method of burning
cars was to take them out into th?- ub
urbs or along treats,
praferabl) at Bight, a to the
gaeeleae tank, which waa always carc
tu.iy loaded to the Irim.
Ment I p in Blaze ol I,lory
"They always went up in a blaze of
glory inside of five or ten minutes," he
said.
Strobel has pleaded guilty to an in?
dictment charging the tiling of a false
claim of loss with the (?lobe Indemnity
Company after he was Implicated by
William K. Barney, head of the auto?
mobile claim department of that con?
cern, who pleaded guilty to grand lar?
ceny. Ramey afterward made a full
confession involving other employes of
the company. Strobel was charg"d a th
having taken a damaged car on which
the Globe company had already paid
$1.200 indemnity and after putting a
new wheel on it running it into a tele?
graph pole and then collecting $1,101
from the same company.
Ramey also implicated in this trans?
action William Stark, mechanician for
the Moon Auto Sales Company, and a
man named Max Wolf, who died before
Ramey confess?': also umler
|5,000 bail, charged with filing a false
claim.
Mr. Weiler said the Moon Auto , M
Company wua not incorporated, and so
far as he could learn others were con?
nected with it besides Strobel. He in?
timated that a* a result of the latter',
confession several more arrests will !
follow.
More than $100,000 In Frauds
"I have been informed by Duncan
Reid, cvaasel for the Globe Indemnity
Company, thet his company has lost
more than $100,000 In two years as a
re?uit of there frauds," said Mr. Wei?
ler. "He now believes that this amount
will be greatly Increased by claims on
cars that have been deliberately tired.
This is the close of the season and the
right time to get rid of old cars. There
isn't much difficulty ia setting an auto?
mobile on tire. Mr. Reid recently told
me he had counted four burned cars by
the roadside between New York and
Tuxedo."
Among the other companies Strobel
says he defraud- d were the F'ederal In

London. Dee. 1.- -The Creek en
has come to a heail. French saib
sent to Athens by Admiral du Ko;
net clashed this morning with Git
reservists on the slopes of the Acre
olis, according to a diapatch to "T
(?aily Mail," which adds :
"Passengers from Pirana s) ?
when passing tne Thessa rsilro
station they witnessed the tightini
"A panic has begun in Athei
Crowds are rushing through t
street-; and shop? are !>eing closed.
"Two French cruisers have e
tered Phsleron Harbor."
The French sailors mentioned we
undoubtedly part of the Knton
landed from vi ssela at tl
Pinaua last night. Earlier dispatch
had reported that they were well i
the march to Athens to compel tl
delivery of arms refused by Kit
rtsntine yesterday.
Serious Fighting Feared
The elosh is regarded here as tl
forerunner of far more serious figh
ing between the Kntente and Gree
forces. It was reported to-day th:
Constantino was preparing to resist I
, the uttermost any efforts of the Ei
ter.te forces to seize arms in Greece.
All day reservists hurried into ti
capii.nl from Thcs.aly and other sei
tions of Northern. Greece, according 1
an "Evening New," dispatch receive
this afternoon. The garrison of Chi
lois was reported early in the da
marching with rifles toward Bchimi
tari.
The consequences of such a clas
will he grave. It is likely that th
Allies will be forced, by the n
anee of the government to Admiral d
Fournet'a demands, to taha Athena an
other parts of Greece under their en
tire control.
Athens Is at fever heat. The situa
t.on la su tena? that the govommaa
troop? are finding it difficult to kee
order, despite the thr .its of Kin
' onstontinc that snj outbreaks woul
j ilnni' ? quelled.
King Losing (on(rol
..chis .rom the city this morn
ing report ral minor disturb
ame.? took place last sight and thi
morning. No one wa? injured, accord
ing to these advices. It is becominj
increasingly apparent that Constantin?
is rapidly losing control of tha situa
tion.
Admiral du Fournet's ultimatum ex
pired to-day. He had demanded tha
the first delivery of arms-sixty-foui
machine guns be made by December 1
In view of the definite refusal of th?
Greek government yesterday to delivei
any arms, the Fr?tente commander evi
dently did not wait until to-day before
taking the forceful measures he had
threatened if his demands Sere not
lod to.
The arrest of prominent personages
taking part in any res.stance against
? forces was ..lso threaU'ned
by Admiral du Fournet. It is likely
that an attempt to carry out this threat
will constitute the first act of the ad?
miral when his forces reach the city.
May Resist Fntranee
It is barely possible that the Cr/>e'<
forces ?rill rest?t the ?nlrance of the
Entonta troops into Athens. The con
kensu? of opinion here to-night is,
however, that King Constantino will
give orders that no opposition is to be
shown the Entente forces until they at?
tempt to seize arms or arrest govern?
ment e>mpathizers.

Germany Claims She
Was Transport?Will

? r- ? IB, T-,v -? S sob,
Washington, Pec. 1. The German
government, in a communication deliv?
ered to the State Department tO-day,
admits that the British st?'amer Ma?
rina, on which six Americans lo?t their
live?, was sunk deliberately by a Oat*?
man submarine. The act is defended,
however, on the ground that the vess?l
w.i? an "armed transport"
Ambassador von Bernstorff saw Sec?
retary I.an sing and asked for further
information concerning the circum
BS of the attack. He told the
Secretary that his government would
apologize, make reparation and i ?
tlie commander of the submarine if it
was found that the Marina was in fact
a peaceful merchantman.
Secretary Lansing then conferred
with President Wilson. It was deed- i
that no action would be taken by this
government until the question whether
the Marina was a private vessel or a
belligerent transport had been settled.
Pledge Apparently Broken
Though admitting that the act seems
to be a violation of Germany's pledges
to the United States, officials indicated
to-day that no action would be taken
until President Wilson had heard from
the American people. There ia a
growing belief in Adrainiatration qaar
ten that the attitude of the people
toward submarine warfare has ci.

\\ as a Private Ship
.?,- the State Department has
thai a asara charter did

a private ship. But it was admitted
to-day that as a result of Germany's
plea the general question "what is a
merchant ship?" probably would bo
opened for discussion with the German
government.
If such a discussion is opened, there
is hardly the remotest possibility, ofi?
ci?is agree, that a rupture in relations
will result. It may, however, clear up
a question which th?t State Department
has been able to avoid up to this time
and which has been regarded by diplo?
mats as a source of possible misun
derstaadiag between Germany and the
United States.
