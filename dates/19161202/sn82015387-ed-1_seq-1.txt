With ideal weather conditions and
before a large and enthusiastic crowd
of epectators St. 'Paul's College again
showed their superiority by defeating
the visitors from Mississippi by a
tremendously high score. The
world's record of 45 points made by
one man in a single game was lower
ed by Cassius Richard, who scored
60 points. This was a distinctly out
standing feature of the game, made
by 8 touchdowns and 12 kicked
goals out of a possible 17. While
the record made ,by IRichard will not
be allowed to stand as a world's rec
ord because of being made in a
minor college game, nevertheless it
will stand a long time before it is
tbeaten or even duplicated.". It is a
well known tact that each and every
team throughout the country has its
hero or popular idol on the gridiron,
and to CassiesaRichard rightfully be
longs this title. Another striking
play duirng the game was the 60
yard run by Y. Fields, 'who in catch
ing the ball from a punt and not
hesitating or ialtering withstood all
opposition until he was si..e behind
the goal for a touchdown, this mak
ing his second for the day.
Landry and Fruge did their goodly
share toward the high score by each
scoring three touchdowns, and B.
Richard scored one to his credit.
The team as a whole outplayed their
opponents and showed themselves tq
be in dne fettle.
Owing to the late arrival of the
visitors the game was not called un
til 3:30 and darkness had set in be
fore the game was over, much to the
di·sappointment of the crowd.
The score was 114 to 0.
Althotugh the visitors were out
classed, special mention of Brook,
Patterson and R. Lewman (playing
for Aysook) and Cauasey is deserved.
Cbach C. M1. Adams *as greatly dies
appointed over the showing made by
his boys.
This .was the sixth game of the
season for St. Paul's College. The
first resulted in a tie with the Baton
Rouge High. In the other Ave games
the opposing teams did not even
score. The result is that St. Paul's
College claims the championsh~ip and
Ithe Boys'I ,(New Orleans) also
claims it. Est hs been issuaed
by St. Paul's tthe iBoys' High, but
they refuse to play. Could these
two teams be brought together to
settle the supremaey it would be a
decided drawing card. 'But until
then, the question is: Which of the
two teams is the champion?

EDBY EXERCISES
School Furnishes Interesting
Program and Debate by
Literary Society.
A very worthy custom of the
King's Daughters has Ubeen the pro
vision made for the enjoyment of
Thanksgiving by those whose means
will not allow the expenditure neces
sary for a Thanksgiving dinner.
Every year it has been the custom
to make up Thanksgiving baskets
and to distribute them among the
deserving needy, and it has a:ways
been a task that has brought much
pleasure in the giving and much hap
pinees into a number of homes. This
year the ;undertaking has developed
into larger proportions than ever be
fore, and the contributions of the
school children have swelled the con
tents and number of packages into
proportions that made a very liberal
distribution possible.
The giving of these ,packages was
made a part of the program of, the
Thanksgiving exercises of the Cov
ington High School. Wednesday,
Novemlber 29, the auditorium of the
school was crowded to overflowing by
.pupils and parents and friends. The
'Freshman-Sophmore Literary Socie
ty carried out a -program suggestive
of the season, and each grade put on
a number that was very much en
joyed.
The debate: "Resolved, that the
tarkey and not the pumpkin pie 'is
the Thanksgiving dish," was ably
argued by Cathrine Morrison and
Stanley Bierhorst in the affirmative,
and Annie Riggs and Frank Artus in
the negative. The decision was giv
en to the affirmative.
After the program Prof. Park, in
a few well chosen words, called the
attention of the audience to the
stage, where the large hampers and
boxes, flled to overflowing with gro
ceries, ruit -and clothing, had -been
placed by the different grades to be
distributed among our needy and sick
friends in Covington and surround
ings.
Mr. E. J. Domergue, of the Cov
ington Grocery & Grain Company,
with his usual liberality donated a
barrel of apples to the good oause.
It was turned over to the King's
Daughters, and Mrs. H. T. G. Weaver
leader, with a committee of ladies,
received it and proceeded at once to
distribute. Seventeen large 'boxes,
sevral baskets and large bags of
rauit were sent out.
This twork of love, which has been
a habit of the school children for a
number of years, is a most commend
able one, teaching them sympathy
and generosity and bringing them
loser to the life and needs of less
fortunate humanity.
The King's Daughters deeply ap
preciate this great help in their
work, end during this beautftal
Ihanksgiving season ask God's -rich

CAUSES OF ANDI
PREVENTIONOF
CHARBON IN
CATTLE
By G. C. Lewis.
,Since we have had an outbreak of
charbhon this fa 1 and some 60 or 65
head of cattle died, I think it wise to
have. pub.isheed in The Farmer, at
this time, a few pointers on the dis
ease.
People are interested more now
than they will 'be next spring because
we have just had some experience.
The following short treatise on
charbon was prepared by Or. Flow
ers, Executive Officer of State Live
Stock Board. The main points in
,fighting and preventing the disease
are clearly brought out. The three
different types of cherbon are clear
ly explained and all should study
thip part of it in order to better be
aible to detest the disease upon its
appearance in the herd. Many peo
ple think dharbon is quicklly stamp
ed out, but as this treatise says, the
germ will live for years when once
the soil becomes nifected and next
summer is the time when the stock
will die If not properly vaccinated
with fresh vaccine. I know of sev
eral places where animals have been
dragged away and the germs scat
tered along where the charbon car
eass had passed. I also know of one
case where the animal was not burn
ed in time and the buzssards had
plenty of time to scatter the disease
germ over the third ward, and I
think this has been pretty well done.
It is for that reason that I write
these few lines. 'I do not want to
see several hundred dollars worth o'
stock die next summer before we
can get the vaccine and get around
with the vaccinating. In March or
April, while there is plenty of timn
and vaccine can be had is the time
to getb busy. The vaccine has plenty
time to take then- before hot weather
sets iin, atia when the disease breaks
out in July you have well played the
game of "Safety First." Read Dr.
Flower's words on the disease:
Charbon.
Anthrax Is primarily a disease oif
domestic animals, oceuring as an.
epizootte in cattle, sheep, horses and
rules, and, for his reason is one of
tr ~ a em.· lup.

The steel bit of the well driver
has gone deeper into the bowels of
St. Tamrmany parish than ever be
fore, under the direction, of the Me
ridian 011 and Gas Company, and the
locality of Sulphur Springs will prove
interesting to the geologist, if he has
a talk with the secretary of the com
"pany, Mr. iW. H. Martin, who is in
charge of the anticipated oil dield of
that section. For several months
the driller has 'been grinding into
solid rock, coammenning at a dlepth of
about 2700 feet. The took has been
so hard and tough that each inch
of progress was measured by hours
of labor, and- the wearing out of
drills became quite an item of ex
.pense in putting down the well.
More lasting penetrating drills were
ifinally secured, and several feet can
now be drilled in hours that took
days before.
The well is now 2,900 feet deep.
'and probably two 'hundred feet of
rook has been drilled through. Then
came the guumbo and more rock, and
in this latter rook has been found
fossils, surmised to beO.tA0 1e~t .a
some ancient creatures of the sea.
E9vidently this great strata of rock is
the tomibstone of some. monster of
the deep, in a grave yard "that was
once the bottom of the sea, that
thousands and thousands bf years
ago plowed the waters ihat then
covered this section of the State. The
ingenuity of man has finally brgughl
portions of these fossils to the air
and light in Covington, to sbe handled
and looked and wondered at. But
it is not bones of dead monsters
that the Meridian company is after.
It is oil; and every day seems t3
bring fresh indications that it Ils
some where beneath this great rock,
if we may judge 'by the expressions
of oil men, some of them direct from
the oil fields of Beaumont. The
drilling tof this Sulphur Spring well
is being watched very closely by oil
people in other sections. If the
strike should come, Covington would
be transformed to almost as great
an extent as this former bottom of
the sea has been changed.
CITIZENS AND
RAILROAD OF
FICIALS TALK
OF DEPOT
Vice President Farris and Mr.
Henley, of the New Orleans Great
Northern Railroad, attended a meet
ing of the citizens of .ovingtont and
the Association of Commerce, Mon
day afternoon, to discuss the ques
tion of a new depot. Mr. B. M. Mil
ler, attorney for the road, was pres
ent.
The meeting became a little warm
at times, but the matter was gone
over in all the details, and white the
compalny expressed itself as wlluing
to fi up the old depot and put in
proper toilets, etc., and perhaps move
the freight room to another position,
it was stated positively that the
road could not build a new depot.
Mr. Farris was asked to at least
think the matter over and consider
whether it would not be possible to
-put the depot n -another g.as, if
there was not room for a depot at
,the present site. 't was suggeted
that there was apilece of .lad near
the Covington Grocery & Grain (the
Pottevent tract) that woulnd be bet
ter for a depot and would do away
with the dangerous switching of
trains made necessary by the pres
ent situation.
Mr. Farris did not give any en
couragement to the proposition, but
stated that he would write in a few
days, after further investigation.
So the matter rests pretty much in
the eame position as before the meet
tig, except that if the people are
wlitng to accept the present depot
with such alterations as the com
pany will make, the depot will be
painted and xied uji and toilets put
