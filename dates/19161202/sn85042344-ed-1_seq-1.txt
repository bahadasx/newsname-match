If overtures for an honorable peace

RKOWNSVII.LK. Texas, Dec. 1.
Major General John F. Oltyun,
commanding the New York guard
division In the Hrownsvllle district,
and the officers of Hie Twelfth New
rk infantry today refused to dis
cuss a report that the resignations ot
Colonel Gordon Johnson and all
other officers of the Twelfth bad
been sent to the war department ut
Washington. General eritvan de
clared it a matter to be ' handled
xxitbiii the army.
Reports given credence here said
that the resignations wero the result
of events that took place recently
during a review In honor of Senator
James W. Watson, Jr., of New York,
who was on u visit to tho divisional
headquarters.
According to the story extent In
military circles, the Twelfth passed
the reviewing stand with tile regi
mental flag furled und short of one
battalion. This anil some of tho
regiment's marching formations are
said to have been unsatisfactory to
General ii'Rvan. and be is said to
have Instructed the Tweltih to pass
the reviewing stain! a second time, in
(lie meantime leaving the field with
bis guests and placing the review in
the coiniuaiid of Hrigailler General
.lames Beater.
The Twelfth's officers, it Is re
ported, regarded this action as an
insult They claimed, it is said, that
the reason the flag was not unfurled
was due to the fact that ft- was an old
one and not in shape to withstand a
whipping wind They are said to
have explained further that all com
panies are short of strength and that
tile iihsence of a battalion xxas not
unusual.
The Twelfth New York Is known

Johnson is a captain in the regular

Doe-tor Hawley f .Unwed this
up with 11 meeting of till- dairymen nf
the city In his offices 111 the city hull

One of the issues em which little if
any difficulty Is encountered in the

this provlson of the orelinanee be

"There will be a little opposition to

yesterday, "but It will develop fieini
