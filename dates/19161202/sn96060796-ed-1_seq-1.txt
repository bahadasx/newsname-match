Moberly, in competition against
the State, he remarked:
"If you can grow corn like
that in Arizona without ir
rigation, you had better quit ir
rigating. Corn like that would
win over corn grown in the Corn
States."
"MEXICO WILL DO RIGHT.
Secretary Lane Outlines United States
Mexican Policy.
Following the signing of the
agreement by the American and
Mexican peace envoys, Secretary
Lane, of the department of the
interior. issued a statement
defining the policy of the United
States trovernment toward Mex
ico. He stated that he believed
General Carranza a strong man
and that he should be given a
"full chance." adding that "Mex
ico will either do right without
our help or with it. This is her
choice."
The statement follows:
"The full policy of the United
States with reference to Mexico
is not to be stated in a phrase or
in any protocol or series of
protocols. We are to come out of
Mexico just as soon as we can
'decently and in order,' and
because we have other use for
our troops who are there. But
this is only a beginning of a
policy which will make a Mex
ico that we can live with. "The
border troubles are only symp
toms. Mexico needs system
treatment not sympton treat
ment. She can give it to herself
and we hope she will. We shall
reserve to ourselves the right to
treat her invading bandits as
they should be treated, chasing
them to a finish, if necessary,
unless Mexico gets right into
shape to do this herself. This
will serve Mexico's interest as
well as ours and it will be the
strongest possible deterrent to
raids.
"We will help her to get into
good shape if she can understand
that we mean to be her friend.
The world wants a new Mexico
where the poor and ignorant will
have a better chance. To this
extent the world is with the
revolution. The world has no
sympathy with exploiters, but
it has great respect for rights
that are vested and we shall go
along with the world in protect
ing such rights. But revolution
must not mean auarchy.
"Carranza is a strong man,
I believe. His career shows that
and his followers admine him to
a point of reverence. He is the
man to be given a full chance
and we shall uphold him if he is
sensible of the duties of his nat
ion to the other nations. Mex
ico will either do right without
our help or with it. This is her
choice.
"The purpose for which this
commission was formed was to
exert one last effort toward
making Mexico a possible neigh
bor under this constitutional
government. We do not wish to
be forced into intervention or
any other course until this op
portunaty has been exhausted.
To this end we must pass from
the border matters of irritation
and immediate concern to the
conditions of Mexico which affect
the lives and property of our
nationals. These must be made
as secure as possible in a country
where among the masses of the
people there is a deep distrust of
us. Then we ask that with our
help or without it Mexico feed
herself and drive out disease.
There will be little banditry if
Mexico gets to work.
"The miseries of Mexico must
be assuaged. Her poor, naked,
starving, dying peons, call out
for help. They do not wish
constant war, and only one per
cent of her people are actually
in the war, but all are suffering.
We cannot maintain our self
respect or be true to the highest
dictates of humanity and see
these people suffer as they do
because of the chaos that has
come from civil war.
"This country is pacific, but
is not pacifist. It will fight wil
lingly when it can fight for
something worth while and must
fight. It is our business to make
the occasion impossible to make
the duty unnecessary if this
may be. And so, through many
weeks, we have striven to get
upon a basis that will prepare
the way for a new Mexico one
in which Mexicans and Amer
icans and others can live with
some assurance of safety. But
this is a long way off yet.
"We have jumped only two or
three of the hurdles. We can
see the way out, but it is not
always possible to persuade oth-
i ers that our way is the right
way, though the proposed
reduction of the new export taxes
on ores and bullion and the post
ponements of the decree as to
forteiture of mineral lands, as
well as the agreement reached
with reference to withdrawal of
troops and border control are all
indications of the growing desire
of the constitutionalist govern
ment to meet these standards
which the United States and the
countries of Europe have a right
to expect."
CAMPBELL LEADS.
Official Count Gives Him Forty Major"
ity Contest Certain.
The official count is virtually
completed in all the counties of
the state and show that Thomas
E. Campbell, the republican
candidate forgoverner to have a
lead of 40 votes, says the Tomb
stone Blade.
It is practically certain that
there will be a contest and a
recount of all the votes cast for
governor. A tetnoorary injunc
tion will be asked for restraining
the secretary of state from is
suing an election certificate to
Mr. Campbell until after the con
test has been concluded. This
will mean that Governor Hunt
will retain the office of governor
for several months after the
first of January. The friends of
the governor claim that a recount
will show that the governor has
been re-elected by a good margin.
This claim is made upon the
presumption that certain votes
cast for Mr. Campbell will be
thrown out on the recount. In
other words it is stated that many
electors stamped a cross at the
head of the democratic ticket
and then plced a cross opposite
the name of Thos. E. Campbell
for governor, which, it is claimed
invaridates the ballot in so far
as it affects the candidates for
governor. This is a mooted
question and remains to be de
cided in court. However, should
the court decide such ballots to
be illegal it is quite certain that
Governor Hunt would retain his
seat as governor, as it is claimed
that several hundred such ballots
were cast in the recent election.
In that event the case will pro
bably go to the supreme court
of the United States and may
not be decided for a year or two.
