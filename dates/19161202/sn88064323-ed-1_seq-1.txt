JUNIUS JOSEPH'S
RECORD.
The Colored Boy who has an
Unenviable Reputation.
Laut week we gave an account
of some of the doings of Julius
Joseph which led to Ins apprehen
sion and incarceration in jail.
Since then we have gathered more
of the facts of the ease, and some
of i he side lights give a view of
the culprit's character which in
quite unique.
When he was startled by the
alarm from Mr. Clark's residence,
he veiled the back fence and tied
out Fulton street. The Chief of
Police, who had been to Mr. Ber
uard's residence, investigating the
noon burglary there, was just
turning into Fulton street ahead
of the fleeing darkey and his pur
suers He headed him off arid
bagged tin* game.
Junius and his pal, Clarence Fu
selier, ou Nov. 2Und, had entered
the residence of Mr. Joe Courrege
and carried off a revolver and
some other articles of minor im
portance. Junius was arrested
tiie next day as above outlined,
but it was to (he credit of City
Marshal M. J Domingue who fer
reted out Fuseher and recovered
the stolen revolver.
The American Express Go's of
flice was another place command
ing the attention of Junius Joseph
and his pal, Ernest Parké, on
Tuesday, Nov. Ulst. The outer
door of the safe weie unlocked
and the fact was soon discovered.
The kej of the inner door was
taken from A C. Stansbury's coat
pocket—the garment having been
left hanging in the office The
ollice had been left for a moment,
but in that moment the robbers
entered and accomplished their
work, carrying off a sack of pe
cans and a revolver. The weapon
lay ou the bottom of one of the
compartments of the safe. Lay
mg on the revolver, sealed, was a
large official railroad envelope,
containing nearly *2000 in checks
and bank bills—$800 in bills.
This was carelessly thrown aside
and the pistol taken. City Mar
sbal Domingue picked up the
trail and started in pursuit of the
rascals. He located the bag of
pecaus in the house of Mary
Smith after her pioteeting her in
uocence and declaring she knew
nothing of the stolen property.
Both Mary Smith and Ernest Par.
ké were run in by Marshal Do.
uiingue, who aiso recovered the pe
cans aud revolver.
This same boy, Juuius Joseph,
on a former occasion,—some two
years ago—confessed to having
robbed a grave of a skull and to
having sold that ghastly object to
a hoodoo doctor, who used it as a
candlestick and to awe his iguor
ant and superstitious clients. As
the hoodoo doctor denied the sto
ry in toto , and as there were no
other witnesses against the hoo
doo, both parlies were dismissed.
Mr. Eugene Guillot, the mastei
mason and contractor, says he
knows Junius Joseph, who also
answers to the nickname of
"Pépé," very well. The darkey
was known to be such a rascal and
petty thief that he had been re
peatedly warned by the residents
of the south-side to give that part
of the town, a wide berth. Upon
hearing the skull story repeated,
he said he thought it a probable
one. He knew the boy to be not
averse to entering a broken tomb
or an open grave aud to handling
the bones there exposed. He bad
heard oi his carrying off skulls
aud parts of skeletons from such
abandoned graves.
A perfect town is that in which
you see the farmer patronizing the
home merchants, the laborers
spending the money they earn
with their own tradesmen, and ail
animated by a spirit that will not
purchase articles abroad if they
can be bought at home. The
spirit of reciprocity between man
and the mechanic, tradesman and
laborer, farmer aud manufacturer,
results every time in making the
town a perfect one to do business
in. "Perfection" should always
be desired, even where attainment
is barely possible, we presume,
but a perfect town must be de
nominated a great rarity until we
reach a more advanced stage to
ward the millennium than has yet
been gained.—Exchange.

THE SWING OF EVENTS!DAY
According to a statement com
ing from New' Orleaus, democratic
politics are moving thick and fast.
The Federal judgship, which came
j near causing a breach between
j Kansdall and Broussard, when
j each of these statesmen wanted
I their favorites to take the place
quade vacant by the death of
j Judge Boarman, and which breach
is said to be healed by the posai
lde withdrawal of both previous
aspirants, and the substitution of
Governor Pleasant for the place.
It is better than the governor
ship and lasts longer. The ap
pointee holds the office until he
dies or resigns, which he never
does, and the only hitch in the
linal disposition of this case is
that Lieuteeant Governor Mouton
refuses to be dictated to by the
steering committee, who generally
recommend all who gets close
enough to the pie counter to look
into the pay window.
According to the news, a "get
together meeting," which was par
ticipated in by celebrities from all
factious, and the preliminaries to
the plains with this end in view,
were set m motion, but up to the
present, no great headway has
been made, but the people of Lou
isiana need not be surprised if
this development takes place.
Mr. Pleasant, of course, could
not be blamed for leaving Baton
Rouge, if something better pre
seated itself, extending over a pe
riod "until death do us part,"
with larger pay and less work.
If these plans result iu a reality,
Mouton will become governor, aud
he will either "stand hitched," or
the practical politicians will not
agree to let Pleasant go.
And another item in the report
is, that the present governor is
not averse to serving a few terms
in the Fedeial senate, as the sue
cessor of Broussard, whose term
will eud first iu the list. The
judgeship will take him out of the
possibilities, and if there is one
thing that meets with the ap
proval of a democratic office
holder, it is to get opposition out
of the way aud clear the route to
another term.
We do not give a sumarkee who
holds the offices. This outfit has
no suggestions to offer We did
not assist in landing the present
aggregation in Baton Rouge, aud
we have nothing to do with their
affairs, but merely re-state the
news as it comes from the source
of supply.
There may be some additional
developments to record within a
few days—as soon as the lines are
well laid.—Franklin Watchman.

HIS SOUL GOES
MARCHING ON.
The St. Louis Republic of Nov.
9th asks: What put Ohio into the
Democratic Column. The influ
ence of a man who being dead,
yet speaketh—Tom Johnson!
Twenty years Plutocracy ruled
Ohio. Mark Hanna was the best
financial organizer in the history
of American politics. McKinley,
an honest protectionist, gave to a
bad cause, the moral weight which
can only be supplied by a good
man. Foraker's brilliancy and
prestige impressed Republicanism
on the imagination of the nation.
McKinley had just been elected
President, and it was written in
the stars that his successor would
be followed at the Whitehouse by
another Ohio Republican. Boss
Cox held Cincinnati in the hollow
of his band, while Mark Hanna
looked after Cleveland. Ohio Re.
publicanism bad money, brains,
personal power, tactical skill, and
the strength that comes from or
ganized self interest. It had ev
ery thing except great ideas In
Cleveland there was a steelmaker
with some new fangled ideas
about popular rights. Tom John
son started ont to make bis ideas
count. He encouraged Bigelow
in Cincinnati, and Jones and
Whitlock at Toledo to fight the
good fight for a clean government.
He died beaten and poor. Now
the people of Ohio worship the
memory of Tom L. Johnson. And
thns history repeats itself:
The howling mob of yesterday
in silent awe returns. And gath
ers np the ashes into historic's
golden wins. And a question
once settled right is usually per
manent. Ohio will never forget
the lessons taught by the love and
sacrifices of martyred Tom John
son. Josie Thorpe Price.

CONGRATULATIONS,
Candidate Hughes has forward
ed his congratulations to i'n-si
dent Wilson, aftei fifteen days <d
watchful waiting, iu the hope that
the official count of California
would determine that there migln
be a possibility of a "miscoufiic
tion" in the first count of the
votes.
We have the satisfaction <>f
possessing a democratic president
during the existence of the war
when the farmers can sell their
produce for nearly twice as muon
as the normal market price, but
when the thing is over—if there
happens to be enough men left
after the coufiict to accomplish
any purpose—the people of the
belligerent countries are going to
pat the producing capacity of tIn
land up to its highest mark, and
will have to face the heavy com
petition, with the low' tariff du
ties, and then things will not look
so good.—Exchange.

REAL CAUSES
FORJÎRATITUDE,
Thankfulness for the Vaster
Blessings of Life Should
Be the Duty of All.
To give thanks for the more
particular benefits, valuable in a
small way iu our own lives, would
seem to me dispensable, and of
proportionately little value; but to
show gratitude aud appreciation
for the vaster blessings with which
the life of each one of us is eu
riched, this, it would seem to me,
is indispensable.
We are usually down on our
knees, thankful if some project of
ourowu succeeds, if something we
desire for ourselves or for our
friends comes to pass; but high
noons aud sunsets, stars and gr,-at
rivers, cities ghtteiing in tiie
night, plains and valleys silent
under the moou, dawu across th
sea, the mantle of the storm aud ;
fringes of the rain, and a world!
made new each day, and that j
large companionship of joy aud
sorrow and hope shared with men
and women whose lives merely;
brash oars in passing, and in j
whose faces we npy perhaps no' ;
look again—for these, these royal
gifts, what gratitude of high and
noble living do we offer!—From

says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before 1 began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, 1
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
\ wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. ! still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
f ired, worn-out feelings, etc., are Sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
