effect that "by the disobedience
of one man sin entered the world
and death by sin and so death
passed upon all men."
You'll have to hand it to Rev.
West. He's a game Bport. When
a little out-and-out reporting hit
him in the theological midribs, he
didn't keep the white flag up
long. He was for sticking it out
to the finish. And he knew ex

I say red-blooded, because

Who Is Greatest War Heroine?
England Names Hospital Nurse
\<<-.»|ili|,rr Enterprise Aaaoclatlo
LONDON, Dec. 2. —Kather-
ine Mary Davies is beralded
throughout England today as
the greatest heroine ln the
European war!
France is proud of Eme
inne Morcau, Belgium of
Edith t'avell, Austria-Hun
gary of "Sister Stephanie,"
Russia of Zoya Smirnov,
women who, they say, dis
tinguished themselves more
than any man in the inter
est of their countries.
But the heroine whose
name will go down In Eu
ropean history as the name
of Molly Pitcher is recorded
in American history is Mary
Davies,- who risked her life
not on the battlefield, but in
the little Ris-Orangeis hos
pital in France.
Miss Davies has won her
place in history by saving life,
not destroying It. Two acts
stand out ln her life.
She perfected a system of
sterilizing the dirt-stained,
germ-filled soldiers' uni
forms to prevent Infection
of wounds. This has saved
thousands of lives.
Then she risked her life
to test a newly-invented
antidote for the deadly gan
grene poisoning that resulted
from Germun gas bombs.
Edith Cavell was martyred.
DOBIE—STATE ASSET
Gilmour Dobie, master football coach, is leaving the University of Wash
ington after nine years during which time his teams never have been beaten.
There are certain citizens, I /im aware, who are glad to see his departure.
In their opinion too much emphasis has come to be laid on the WINNING of
games and of championships. With Dohie gone, they reason, the honors will be
more evenly divided, and the game, the sport itself, will receive more attention.
And then there are still others who would like to see all professional coach
ing abolished.
In this matter I confess to being a little old fashioned. I recall the year at
the University of Washington before D.ibie arrived. That season Washington
was beaten "by every team in the Northwest.
Previous seasons had been much the same. The students were disspirited,
the players game, but whipped. The whole institution felt whipped.
The fall Dobie arrived he had pretty much the same set of players. Jarvis,
Bantz, Babcock and Tegtmeir were the backbone of his line. All of them had
been there in the years of defeat.
It is history how that year the U. of W. completely turned the tables, how it
won every game, and how it has gone on doing it ever since. It is history, too,
how, during these same years the U. of W. has advanced and expanded in a mar
velous fashion in every branch.
The difference between the losing and the winning in football was—Dobie.
Now I know Dobie fairly well, and I always admired him because he plays
the game fair, and teaches his men to play it hard but clean.
To my mind the presence on the campus of a man who stands superlatively
high in his vocation, who succeeds always by sheer intelligence, will power and
energy, is a factor that is bound to be an inspiration to every student even if h*'
never goes near the gridiron.
I hope that some way will be deviseed of inducing Dobie to stay. He is ;i
"pep" asset to the whole state.

THE ONLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER IN TACOMA.
TACOMA, WASH., SATURDAY. DECEMBER 2, 1936.
Two heroines of the world war! Miss Davies, a Welsh I
girl, called a heroine as great in Euro|iean history as Molly I
Pitcher of American history—Molly Pitcher who manned a gun II
at which her husband was shot In the war of '7(1 and fought I
off the British. II
shot by tho Germans on a .
charge of being a spy.
Emelenne Moreau, 17-year
old "heroine of Loos," killed
five Germans single-handed.
Zoya Smlrnov of Russia
served in the trenches.
"Sister Stephanie," Count
ess Stephanie Lonyay, spent
a fortune for war widows
and orphans.
And Molly Pitcher of revo
lutionary war fame, manned
a gun, Rt which her husband
had been shot, to keep off
the British.
But no heroine, until Miss
Davies came along, did any
thing directly to SAVE the
lives of the soldiers at the
front. Sterilizing soldiers'
uniforms was big enough.
Now comes what is called
the biggest thing a woman
has ever done in the war.
Dr. Taylor of the American
hospital ln France, had been
working on an antidote for
the deadly gangrene poison
BY THE EDITOR.
tpg that entered the body of
soldiers exposed to the fire
Of Germun gas bombs. He
had tested it on rats and
other small animals, but he
had to have a human volun
teer to be sure of the anti
dote's effect on a person.
Miss Davies heard of Dr.
Taylor's want. Without tell
ing anyone about her plans,
she Inoculated herself with
the deadly poison and called
for Dr. Taylor.
She was his first human
subject and she voluntarily
staked her life on an experi
ment.
Dr. Taylor injected his
antidote, a solution of hydro
chloride of quinine.
Twenty-four hours later.
Miss Davies arose from a
stupor, positive evidence that
Dr. Taylor's antidote will
save thousands of soldiers
who will be sent in the future
to inhale the deadly gas of
the Germans.

1441 'HIT
THE TRAIL'
TOGETHER
BOSTON, Dec. 2.—Hilly
Sunday's campaign in Boston
is breaking all previous rec
ords of that evangelist.
He is having bigger crowds,
bigger collections, more trail
hitters and more enthusiasm
than he ever liad before.
The newspapers pri'it pages
about htm every day, including his
sermons in full, and descriptions
of his preaching which hail him
as the greatest evangelist the
world has ever had.
Even the staid old Boston Tran
script gives him a page a day un
der a headline across the top of
the page: "Billy Sunday's Bos
ton Campaign."
The crowds that go to hear Sun
day are so large that as many as
20,000 have failed to get in, and
the disappointed ones did some
thing that has never been done
before, hundreds climbed upon
the tarred paper roof of the Tab
ernacle in the hope of listening
at the skylights. But so many
got up there that the police fear
ed the roof might fall in and made
them come down.
When Billy made his first call
for trail hitters 1,4 40 came.
In Bill Sunday's vernacular it
was a "stampede to God."
