LONDON, Dec. 2.—Russia is striking
with a giant's force the blows which it
hoped will smash the Teutonic ring of
Bteel gripping Rumania. Dispatches
today indicated no let up in the ter
rific offensive launched by the czar's
legions in Dobrudja. and southwest
Bukowina.
The flanking movement directed at
the JaWonitza pass, is the most serious
menace to German /positions in Ru
mania.
Apparently Russia has poured a
mass of men into the effort to aid Ru
mania, It is conceded that the. Teu
tons must meet this menace of the
flanking movement in ^ukowina with
a large number of defenders. This
Russian offensive covers a distance of
more than 250 miles.
Surrender of the Austro-German
forces at Klrlibaba would not be sur
prising in view of the Russian claims
of domination of this important strate
gic position and raiiroed center,
through control of the heights about
it.
Exceedingly Bitter.
PETROGR£J, Dec. 2.—The most
violent combats are marking the
progress of the Russian offensive In

Every Problem Will bo Handled by

Organizations.
[Uhlted Press Leased Wire Service.]
CHICAGO, Dec. 2.—Co-operation will
be the theme and "help the farmer
and you will help the ultimate con
sumer," will be the cry at the sessions
of,the national'conference on market
ing and farm credits, which beginB
here Monday.
Big men from the banks, co-operat
ive organizations and government and
state organizations will tell the farmer
how to raise more crops-and get better
prices for them, eliminate the middle
man and how to get money to improve
the farm.
The delegates of whom thousands
are expected, will be told that farmers
are now as a class, the auto-owning,
red barn, bond clippers pictured in fic
tion Out of 6,000,000 farmers, nearly
half are tenant fanners. Delegates
will be told that they are soaked by
the commission houses and the pack

that they get nothing hut their food
for their labor and that of their fam
ilies that the cash they have At the
end of the year only represents the
same amount they would have drawn
from a. bank as Interest on their invest
ment.
But the buying public in the cities
will be told that whatever helps the
farmer will help them. Lafger crops
and the elimination of the middle man
will enable the farmer and the consum
er to get closer together and they will
divide In higher selling and lower buy
ing the money the middle men get.
Speakers will tell the public that
there are frequently three and four
profits between the farmer and the
consumer. Each man takes his share
and the farmer at the finish 1b holding
the bag and the consumer an empty
pocket book, while the commission
men, buyer, wholesaler and retailers
are riding in autos.
Every problem the farmer has,
from run-down barns to keeping the
boy on the farm, will be handled by
some expert in that line. The grain
embargo will also come in for its share
of attention. Stock raising problems
will not be slighted either.
