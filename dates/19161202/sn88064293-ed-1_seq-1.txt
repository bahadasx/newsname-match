It is absolutely impossible to give you any idea of the
quality, flavor and richness of STONE'S "RICH FRUIT"
CAKE through the medium of paper and ink.
We could easily use a column in telling you about the
materials that go into it—Pineapples from Hawaii, Al
monds from Spain, Pecans from Texas, Cherries from
California, and so on through the list of twelve fruits that
are used—but what good does it do to name them over,
when the deliciousness is only half in the materials, the
other half being the art and skill with which they are
combined to make the perfect FRUIT CAKE.

REVETTING OP GRAND BAY LEVEE
Work of Greatest Importance to Southwest
Now Under Wa
.Much interest is now being mani
fested by citizens of Morgan City
and St. Mary Parish in the work of
revetting Grand Bay Levee on the
Mississippi River, where Government
Engineers are working extra crews
ir. order to complete the job before
the spring rise, following the winter
months, when the annual swell of
the "Father of Waters" threatens
agricultural industries of South
Louisiana. During the rise of last
spring Grand Bay Levee enjoyed
considerable publicity, thru the
efforts of citizens of this section
who made representations to the
Mississippi River Commission, call
ing their attention to the grave dan
ger of this section of any weakening
of this particular levee. It is estima
ted that a break at this point would
place nine feet of water on the
streets of Morgan City and
every foot of ground in St.
Parish.
Mainly thru the efforts of Mr.
Andrew Gay, Jr., and Mr. Humph
reys of the Atchafalava Levee
Board, this work has now been un
dertaken by the Federal Govern
ment, and it is thought the levee will
be in good shape by next spring.
The boils at Grand Bay Levee were
calculated to send chills over persons
with financial interests in St. Mary
Parish, and an organization was
formed in Morgan City last year,
having for its object the protection
of the right bank of the great river
This organization is called the Atcha
falaya Basin Levee Protection As
sociation and is compose! of leading
citi tus rf St. Maty. M .re than
$3,000 was raised in 1915 to patrol
the banks of the river, and Mr. Far
ley O'Brien of this City was engaged
to operate crews above and below
cover!
Mary
the Grand Bay location. Ml* O'Brien
did excellent work last year with his
crew of workmen, and it is proposed
to keep the organization a going
concern for future good it may ac
complish. This organization strongly
advocated the revetment of Grand
Bay Levee, while Mr. Gay and Mr.
Humphries were also instrumental in
pointing out to the Federal River
Commission the importance of look
ing after this impending danger.
For a fortnight or more, day and
night crews have been at work with
hydraulic dredges washing down the
banks of the river's edge to a slope
of 4 to 1, preparing for the big rock
laden willow mattresses to be sunk
at the water's edge and the rock fac
ing on the sloping bank, which will
prevent the erosion and undermining
of the bank by the strong river cur
rent directed at this point with its
full force.
Grpnd Bay levee has beeri called
by the levee authorities the term that
Sherman applied to war. During high
water the low land behind the levee
has been filled with what are called
"sandboils," where the water oozes
out of the ground on the land side
and fear of the heavy water pressure
on the river side keeps up the con
stant fear of the levee being under
mined. The constant caving of the
bank during the low water stage is a
source of worry to the levee en
gineers and the levee board because
it means that every few years a new
levee will be needed.
The national government is under
taking the revetting of this bank.
Hydraulic dredges, which are noth
ing more than larger heavy water
hose with 175 pounds presure, are
being used to slope the 25-foot bluff
banks to the desired incline. This
slope is to be paved with rock to pre
vent further erosion.
The government towboat, the
Plaquemine, brought doyrn eight '

The laxative properties of fruits
and vegetables are not destroyed by
canning t£ew
mats made of woven willow trees on
Monday and tied them up to the
bank. These mats measure 150 feet
j long and 400 feet in width. It will
take about thirty of these mats to
! revet this point. Each mat will be
! towed and placed and weighted down
i with rock to a fifteen-pound pres
| sure to the square foot and sunk to
| the bottom of the river, sloping from
\ the bank at the present stage of
j water toward the center of the river,
I The mats will be sunk so as to lap
each other five or ten feet, and the
thirty mats will revet the bank 4,000
feet or more. The work of shingling
or paving the bank to the depth of a
foot or more will then be done.
The Lafourche, another govern
ment towboat, appeared on the scene
Monday last, towing four barges
loaded with rock boulders to be used
on the job. This rock is quarried
! near Little Rock Arkansas, trans
ported by rail to Ferriday, where it
is unloaded from the cars onto
barges in the river.
Engineer Douglas and his assist
ant, Mr. Waddell, are actively in
charge of the work. They have em
ployed some two hundred men, most
ly white, and are rushing the work
to completion. According to Mr.
Douglas it will take two and a half
months of favorable weather to com
plete this revetment.
Twenty thousand dollars will be
expended on making a landside en
largement on the Grand Bay levee
and to strengthen it and prevent the
recurrence of the dangerous sand
boils. This work wil be in charge of
another engineering department of
the government and suction dredges
will be used to advantage. By means
of these dredges dirt from the bat
ture will be thrown behind the levee
to fiH the low P lace and a lon S'
the District.
gradual slope will be made from the
top of the levee back several hund
red yards.
Other Dangers
There are other dangers on the
Mississippi River than sand boils and
weak levees. It is pretty well estab
lished that New Orleans is looking
toward letting others get the duck
ing if this can | be accomplished.
Levees have been cut in the past, it
is asserted, and may be cut again.
One of these works accomplished
last year by the Atchafalaya Basin
Levee Protection Association was to
keep a constant guard on the most
dangerous portion of the right bank
of the River and make constant re 7
ports to the constituted authorities
on any danger which came up. It is
hoped this organization will be main
tained and strengthened for the
year 1917. The town of Morgan City,
thru Mayor Shannon, was a member
of this Association last year, and it
is understood activities will soon be
gin to revive the former association.
H. M. Cotten on Board
It is suggested to Governor Pleas
ant that this section should be repre
sented on the Atchafalaya Levee
Board, since this vicinity is in the
immediate path of any destruction
which a break in the River might oc
casion, and the name of Mr. Hérbert
M. Cotten has been recommended by
local citizens and by members of the
present board. Mr. Cotten is fi
nancially interested in this
section owning considerable pro
perty here and elsewhere, is Presi
dent of the First National Bank, ami
would do credit to the Board. The
Governor could make no better se
lection than Mr. Cotten for this
place.
It is understood Dr. King of New
Iberia has resigned and his place will
likely be filled with a resident of the
District. Dr. King is not a resident of
