PROTECTS HIS CUSTOMERS
The true merchant the home mer
chant seeks at all times to see that
his customers are not deceived or im
posed upon. He learns to know the
reliable jobbers and manufacturers
he deals only with them, fie carries
only standard brands goods bearing
the stamp of honesty. By making a
study of his business, by knowing
merchandise as the mechanic knows
steel and iron, or as the"farmer knows
the grain and live stock, the mer
chant is able to discuss intelligently
with his friends and neighbors the
questions of value, quality, style and
workmanship, and, by actual tests
and comparisons to explain to the
buyer just why certain brands and
makes will give greater satisfaction,
or greater service to the user. He is
able to show just why an inferior art
icle ct a cheap price may be far more
expensive than a good article which
costs a higher price. The home mer
chant can take up with you the vari
ous methods of manufacture. From
the great mass of information at his
command, he can tell you how unfair
manufacturers, seek to profit at the
expense of the buying public, send
out oil-brand gocds under names al
most like the. names and brands used
by honest makers how these manu
facturers claim their goods to be of
first quality, when they are not first
quality at all. Today, there is sub
stitution inevery line of merchandis
ing goods which to theordiuary buy
er seems to be as kood as any offered
on the market, but which are made
to sell, not for service. The home
dealer knows these things. It is his
business to keep posted. He sees to
it that these questionable makes and
brands do not find a place In his store.
His success depends on fair dealing.
He sees to it that the buyer gets
quality quality first quality the
highest that can be had. And qual
ity is the thing that counts. Cheap
stuff, as we all know, is no good at
any price (Copyright 1916.)
THEIR TIME TO LAUGH
Republicans might as well joyously
concede that in the practical game of
practical politics the "Democrats Sim
ply smothered them in this gladsome
-catastrophy of 1916. The Big Hit
which the Democrats put on, looking
serious all the while, was the popular
-song of the year, "He Kept Us Out of
War." It was the little trick which
brought home the bacon. And there
is no use for the Republicans to get
sore because today the Democrats all
over the country are laughing them
selves to death about it they have a
right to bust themselves a iaughin.'
' . In happy throngs tfr"y are gathering
to recount how they had the cold
shivers running down the spices of
the dear people, how they had splen
did - women softly weeping , as they
toli how the horrors of war would
descend like an avalanche if Hughes

MARKET REPORT
Kansa3 City Stock Yards, ' Novem
ber 28, 1916. Ten thousand cattle
came in, and as they all had to sell
to killers it looked like a lower mar
ket at first, but finally cows and but
cher stock sold strong, beef steers
fully steady, the only kind showing
weakness being thin kinds of steers,
ordinarily taken by country buyers.
Hog receipts were 22,000, market 5 to
10 lower, sheep and lambs 6000, mar
ket strong to 10 higher.
Beef Cattle Nothing prime was in
cluded, best steers here stepping at
$10.40, yearlings at $9.65. Lower
grades sold downwards to Sb.oo, the
receipts largely local stuff, as long
distance shipments were stopped or
diverted yesterday, on account of
the partial quarantine in effect here,
pending outcome of the observations
of suspected case of foot and mouth
disease in the yards. So far nothing
corroborates the belief that the said
disease exists here,, save the sore
mouth symptom, which might come
from other cause, and the scare is
apparently blowing over, though the
experts have not issued a positive
statement up to this time. Canner
cows sold strong today, buyers w ait-
ing in line Tor them, besides taking
several hundred hold over thin stock
calves at $5.50, for canning purposes.
btockers ana t eeders The interior
grades held in the yards have been
disposed of to killers as canners, but
ttie good ones 'will be kept till the
final outcome of the investigation is
known. In the meantime it is not
advisable to send stockers and feeders
to market.
Hogs Receipts overran the morn
ing estimate of 16000 bv some 6000.
The market opened, slowly, but - set
tled down to a o to lu lower basis, top
price $9.90, bulk $9.40 to $9.85, heavy
and medium weights each bringing
the top, lights $9 70. Everything was
cleaned up early except some mixed
loads of light weights, . containing
many pigs, these having to stand con
siderable sorting. Quality is steadily
improving, the liberal supply today
being best average quality seen here
in two months.
Sheep and Lambs Lambs sold up
to $12.10, all the strictly good ones at
$12 and upwards, and ewes brought
$7.85, new high records for ' this sea
son. Some fair to good wethers
brought $3 15. Cull stock was sold
at the usual margin of two cents a
pound or more below top stuff. . Mod
erate supplies are in store for another
week or two, when the run mar pick
up a little, cars having been ordered
for the crop of Colorado pea fed
lamJtK starting next week.

Dicta grams
The time to learn political lessons
is just after an election, and the best
time to recall them is just before the
next one. - . '
. o ' - : " -
When both sides claim everything
in sight by overwhelming majorities,
look out for a tie vote.
But what's the use? Some of us
just won't learn anything and most
of us are prone to forget.'
o
Take notice that the. first congress
woman is a Republican and that she
comes from a woman suffrage, pro
hibition state. Be your own brake
man. However, unless congress is called
in special session the new congress
woman w ill not have a chance to cut
any ice before December, 1917, and
by that time you will have forgotten
her name. Perhaps you have forgot
ten it already?
. o '
Also just after an election is the
time to hear alleged reasons, excuses
and explanations of the way it hap
pened. One Trego county lady was
overheard to say that she voted for
Mr. Wilson because she didn't like
Mrs. Hughes. .
o
However- amusing some of the ex
cuses may be, probably the best ex
planation is that a lot of voters
quitely sneaked in a vote for Wilson
without any bells on it and since elec
tion, for obvious reasons, they are
not saying anything about it.
o
Montona voted for Wilson and pro
hibition. They have woman suffrage
in Montana. . Be your own brake
man. o
We all very naturally have great
respect for the opinions of those peo
ple whose opinions coincide with our
own opinions. Dod Gaston says he
thinks the women were not to blame
for the election of Wilson.
o
Gaston also seems to think that
offering congratulations to a success
full opponent is a foolish custom, but
this writer believes it is more com
mendable than .the "card of thanks"
fad, in most instances.
An Illinois friend, who feels dis
appointed over the election of Wilson,
writes as follows: "I expect we will
live through it, but we .may never
2ooklikjeanjtMng again. -
Also, our Illinois friend seems to
think that Kansas needs fixing, pol
itically. I don't see it that way. She
fixed herself, good and plenty. ..
o
The total vote of Kansas on pres
ident wa. 729,311, and Wilson lacked
317 of getting one half of them. It
is a narrow margin (and rather cold
comfort) but it serves to save our
race.
After all, since-the Republicans
failed to get control of congress it is
just as well that Wilson was elected.
Mighty sour grapes anyway.
o -
At the recent election 2143 Trego
people were enrolled on the poll
books. Of this number, 1453 were
men and 69Q were women. Of the
wnoie nuiuuer, 01 laueu iu voie lur
president. 121 failed to vote for
sheriff,. 159 failed to vote for county
clerk, and 266 failed to vote for gov
ernor. Similiar differences exist in
the total vote of the state.
o
Some sordid souls go the polls for
the express purpose of voting against'
somebody and seem to think that
when that is done they nave periorm-
ed a just and perfect public duty.
Probably a greater number are anx
ious to vote for only two or three
candidates (personal friends, perhaps)
as a favor. Some offices and some
candidates are better advertised and
better kno-vn than others, all of
which tend to bring out a larger vote
in some cases than in others.
The real dutv of the voter begins
months or years before election day.
He should endeavor to know the res
pective Qualifications of different can
didates, even though he cannot form
their personal acquaintance. How
ever, he should not adopt the ex
treme nosition of the lady who re
fused to vote for either candidate for
a certain office because she had never
been introduced to either of them.

AD. IN PAPER FOUND HISSING REL
. - ATIVES
An advertisement inserted In the
daily issue of the Republican of No
vember 3rd last brought information
to two Kansas brothers which they
had;., been seeking for manv vears.
The advertisement was mailed to the
paper by Frank Kuck, of Wilson,
Kansas, asking for information con
cerning his. parents or relatives, and
answers sent by local' people who
reaa me advertisement brought Mr.
Kuck and his brother. Joseph Rasala.
of Trego county, Kansas, to Trenton
riaay, wnere they found the long
sought knowledge.
ins two Drothers were lert by their
mother, Mrs. Anna Hoffman. 'in au
orphans' home, known as '-The Home
of the Association for Friendless
Women," in Leavenworth, Kansas.
April 4th, 1831. A few months later
they were adopted by two Kansas
families and each lad was given a
different name, Frank Hoffman be
coming Frank Kuck and Jesse Hoff
man becoming Joseph Basala.
When the brotners grew old enough
to become curious as to their own
condition, ther began a search for
relatives which ended only when
their inquiries addressed to Trenton
were answered.
The two men came to Trenton Fri
day and had tittle difficulty in locat
ing an uncle, Thos Applegate of this
city, who ia a brother-in-law of their
mother. The father Zack Hoffman
was formerly an employee, of the
Rock Island here and died as the re
sult of injuries received white in the
service of the, company. Mrs. Hoff
man was later remarried and her last
husband is now living at Palmyra,
Mo. Another uncle, Henry Hoffman,
brother of the men's father, resides
at Seymour, Ia. Other relatives loc
ated were Mrs. Lucy Bollinger, Mrs.
Sarah Hall, Mrs. Bettie Smith and
Jas. Gentry, all of this city, cousins
of the two men.
The brothers Saturday . morning
visited the old home at Carnes street
where they were born. Frank Lax,
an old resident remembered their
parents and gave them much valued
information concerning their family.
Mrs. Hall had a small photograph
of their mother and gave it to them.
It is a possession which-they prize
very highly.
"We have certainly enjoyed, our
visit in Trenton," said Mr. Basala
Saturday," and we feel very grate
full to all those who assisted us in
getting the information we wanted.
We are going up to Seymour now to
visit our uncle and shall probably

discovered relatives in Trenton be
