"God's Half Acre."
"God's Half Acre," which will bE
the Sunday feature attraction at the
Grand Theatre, is the most recent of
ferirra the Metro program in which
theti{ r'icn young dramatic artiste.
a ayne, .ca has appeared since
"dsen Half e ,' is unique among
motion pictures. '? gives intimate de
tails of two classes of great institu
tions-homes for the aged and hospi
tals for crippled children. Contrasted
with these pictures of life among the
unfortunate are scenes of wealth ag
distinction. The opening performance
of a great play is depicted, and the
nctables responsible for its success
are shown. In these widely different
strata of society Henry Norman, the
novelist, finds the material for his
books, but the most fascinating of all
his typesis Blossom, the little maid
of-all-work at Rainbow's End, the
home for the aged. Quiet and demure
beyond her years, he calls her "The
Little Old Young Lady."
While' Norman is studying unusual
types, his wife, finding time hanging
heavy on her hands, elopes with his
false friend. Blossom, having inno
cently given Henry her heart, suppos
ing him unmarried, leaves Rainbow's
End in confusion, and to escape the
wrath of the matron, known as "The
Dragon," who has hoped to capture
Norman herself.
How the novelist and his "Little Old
Young Lady" find each other again
through a deed of mercy on the part
of Blossom is sympathetically told in
"God's Half Acre," a powerful story
in which beats the pulse of humanity.
As a romance it possesses the qualities
of novelty, pathos and -suprgme ten
derness in a degree which sets-it above
and apart from the common rtri of,
high-class screerr dramas.
"Under Two Flags."
"Under Two Flags," as picturized
by William Fox from Ouida's cele
brated military drama of the same
name, will be the Moinday attractios
at the Grand, with Theda Bara in the
leading role.
The story concerns Bertie Cecil,
heir of the English Viscount Royalieu,
who has.-shouldered.-the consequences
of his brother's 'rime, and gone to
Algeria, while he is mrourned as dead
by his, frieirds and relatives. In the
French camp, where he enlists, is a
girl,, Cigarette '(Theda Bara), who is
loved by all the soldiers.
Cigarette falls in love with Bertie,
but she realizes he is of a nobler fam
ily, and knows her passion is hopeless.
Chateauroye (Stuart-Holmes), colonel
of the. force, has formed a violent
hatred- toward the young man, who is
enlisted under the name Louis Victor.
In an effort to get rid of hissenemy,
Chateauroye sends Bertie: on7 an ex=
pedition against the Arabs, where he:
is almost certain to meet death. Ci
garette, heading a troop of re-enforce
ments, marches to the aid of the lit
tle band, saves the day for France and
receives the cross of the Legion ofV
Honor.
Then the Lady Venetia (Claire
Whitney), her brother, and Bertie's
weak brother come to the camp. Vene
tia is in love with Bertie, whom she
recognizes, and beve to come back
to his title and el ~e. He refuses,
and sl *11. ing on a couch.
Chateau, .10 L. asing, hears her
sobbing and rushes into the tent. Hle
insults Bertie, who jumps on his su
perior and beats him.
In the court-martial that follows,
Bertie is condemned to die. Cigar
ette, on the strength of her Legion of
Honor cross, gets a reprieve for the
English nobleman from the marshal
of the troops. She rides across the
desert to save the doomed mar.. Pur
sued by Arabs, she is forced to make
a leap across a yawning chasm, on
horseback. Even then, she is caught.
Later she is allowed to go, but has to
rush through a stifling sandstorm be
fore she can return to the camp.
When she arrives Bertie is standing
before the firing squad, ready to die.
Wildly shouting ,Cigarette rushes
forward. She is too late. The men
fire as her horse dashes between them
and Bertie's brave figure, and the bul
lets intended for the Englishman are
lodged in the bosom of the brave
French girl.
Around her fallen body gather the
soldiers. who had loved her since she
was a toddling infant. 13ertie himself
realizes that the poor irl is dying,
and rushes forward. .1e holds her
head on his lap. IU
"It is nothing, this death," she says
in a hoarse whisper. "I am ready for
it. I am glad to do it, for I save the
man I love. He has suffered long and
without murmuring. I, too, can suf
fer without a sound. "I would be hap
py to (lie if only"--she looks longing
ly at those around her-"if only I
could see France again. My loved
France, I- "
Her voice fades away. Her eyes
close. Without a struggle, and with
the ,name of her native land on her
lips, she has died in the arms of the
ltan she loved.
"Little Lady Eileen."
Charming little Marguerite Clark,
herself the incarnation of the elf spir
it, is starred in the fanciful romantic
photoplay, "Little Lady Eileen,"
which comes to the Grand next Thurs
day.
Eileen Kavanaugh is one of those
adorable Irish girls with a facile im
agination that is as creative as the
fairies themselves. She is bubbling
over with the spirit of romance and
wiih the sparkling wit and good hu
mor that is typical of the best that is
Celtic, and even the total financial
failure of her father and the fact that
he has to withdraw her from school
does not in the least affect her gaiety
-for the fairies will take her to her
love when the time comes, so why not
romp and be gay while yet she may?
It means that a very wealthy rela
tive has left all his estate to Eileen
provided she marry a certain very
fine chap. Of course the blessed fai
ries see to it that they meet without
suspecting that they are predestined
to wed, and when the handsome young
chap's rascally brother, having heard
of the yell, succeeds in weddng Eileen
under the name of his brother, the
fairies become so incensed at him for
his duplicity that they roll a huge
rock down upon him and crash the im
poster.
a "S i e oan." 4
"Salvation in which the
captivating sta h d screen star,
Edna May, will en at the Grand
Friday next, tel he story of a high
bred girl who wearies of the empty
life of society when she realizes the
suffering, misery and poverty that ex
ists in the great city in which she
lives. In spite of the opposition of
friends and relatives she joins the Sal
vation Army, but conceals her iden
tity. The poor people love her and
regard her as a benevolent angel who
has decended into their midst to be
one of their own.
Joan is attracted by Bill, who, she
thinks, is one of a gang of rough
characters of the saloon and gamb
ling places, but who really has more
sterling qualities of manhood con
cealed within him if they could be
brought out.
In a fight started at a Salvation
Army meeting by rowdies, Bill comes
to the rescue of Salvation Joan, in
spite of the risk of,great danger to
himself. This wins4 the gratitude of
Salvation Joan and the result is that
Bill becomes a regular attendant at
the Salvation Army srevices. It is
hard to keep love and religion from
mixing.
As a society 'AiSialvation Joan
had previously broken off her en
gagement to Philip: Ralston because
somehow she could not place confi
dence in him. This distrust was well
borne out when Ralston's. associa
tions with gangsters. were accident
ally revealed to her one day, when
she chanced to discover him leaiing
a meeting with a crowd of them.
To promote his diniiter ends, .Rals
ton traps Madeline Ellison, sister of
Joan and the wife of . nAmbassador
Ellison, and threatens that if they
expose him he will scandalize
Madeline. The situation becomes
more and more complicated and
reaches its final climax when "Bill,"
after an evening of thrilling adven
tures, turns out to be a secret service
man and arrests Ralston as a spy,
saving the country from war. Rals
toni, in an attempt to escape, is shot
and killed.
"Bill's" heroism wins the heart of
Salvation Joan and both reveal their
identity, and vow that they love each
other-just as sincerely as when each
thought the other a hiimbler person.

"Graustark" at the Gem Sunday.
"Graustark," a wonderful six-act
photoplay adapted from George Barr
McCutcheon's world-famous novel of
the same name, is announced as the
attraction at the Gem Theatre fcr
tomorrow. Francis X. Bushman and
Beverly Bayne are featured in this
remarkable production, which is uni
versally characterized as one of the
most beautiful and pretentious nic
tures ever filmed. It bristles with cx
citing situations and thrilling action,
and the scenic settings are of a degree
of beauty and gorgeousness that can
not be surpassed. While some of the
scenes are laid in New York and
Washington and on the train from
Denver to Washington, the setting is
chiefly in the mythical country of
Graustark.
The scenes in the United States
were taken at the exact spots repre
sented in the novel, incy f e fa

Grenfall Lori , he hei- 'of the
play, is the type of American beloved
by all lovers of fiction. Rich, hand
some and daring, he falls in love with
a princess traveling in disguise and
follows her half way around the world
to win her hand. The adventures he
'goes through in the turbulent little I
kingdom where she reigns is like a
page from the Arabian Nights.
Facing dangers on every hand, he I
rescues the princess from her abduc
tors, foils the plot of two unscrupu
lous princes to win her hand, and fi
nally saves her from the loss of her
kingdom. He surmounts all obstacles
barring an untitled American from
marrying into a royal family and
finally wins her as his bride.
Francis X. Bushman appears as
Grenfall Lorry, and Beverly Bayne as
Princes -" Yetive.
Danger Signal.
If the fire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help to I
put out the fire? It is much the same
way with a cough. A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire bell. You
should no more try to suppress it than
to stop a fire bell when it is ringing,
but should cure the disease that causes
the coughing. This can nearly al
ways be done by taking Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy. Many have used it
with the most beneficial results. It is
especially valuable for the persistent
cough that so often follows a bad cold
or an attack of the grip. Mrs. Thomas
Beeching,. Andrews, - Ind., - writes:
"During the winter my husband takes =
cold easily and coughs and coughs.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is the
best medicine for breaking up these
attacks and you cannot get him to
take any other." Obtainable every
where.-Adv.

BED-TIME STORIES
By Master Bernard Lemann
(Exactly as written)
Beauty.
When Beauty came to live with
Mary, he was only two months old.
Mary loved him and he always fol
lowed her.
As he grow he became more beauti
ful. His neck was tan and the rest of
his body was a snowy white. Beauty
and Mary grew to be fast friends.
One day a man came to visit Mary's
mother.i He admired the beautiful
dog. This man owned a circus and
agreed to buy Beauty from Mary's
mother, though Mary begged her not
to sell him.
The circus people treated Beauty
meanly and he ran away to the sea
shore.
Children would bring bread to him
every day. He would let them pet
him and would swim for sticks, which
amused the children greatly.
The children grew fond of Beauty
as Mary did. Sometimes he would
swim with them on his back. Each
child had her turn to ride in the wa
ter and the mothers trusted Beauty
with their children.
One day when Beauty was being
petted, he saw a child who was drown
ing. He ran quick and plunged into
the water and swam after her. Beau
ty caught the girl in his mouth and
swam back to land. She was unhurt.
As soon as Beauty looked at the
girl he saw she was his' mistress and
Mary saw that the dog was her Beau
ty. Again were they to play under
the sheltering oaks at her mother's
country home. Again were they to
pick daisies in the sunny fields. There
could not have been a happier girl at
that moment, nor could there have
been a happier dog.
The summer was over and the hap
py friends returned home. And now
let us crown our hero with a wreath
of roses and leave the two happy once
more.

nal of the police jury, parish school
board and city council of Donaldson
ville. Send us your subscription and

;HIEF DANGER IN NSUMPTION
Promiscuous Spittin' ost Frequent
Source on.m
The living terulosi germs are
contained in the spit by millions.
These are easily scattered in the
form of fine spray by coughing. When
spit is cast on the floor or sidewalk it
is easily tracked on the shoes. It
then dries hnd mingles with the dust
of the room.
Dry sputum may also drop off in
flakes from handkerchiefs or soiled
clothing (such as coat sleeves, la
pels or pillow-cases and sheets). It
then gets pulverized on the floor.
The fine spray from coughing and
the dust containing these germs are
readily inhaled and swallowed.
The hands are frequently soiled
with sputum. The food, especially of
infants and children, is thus contam
inated if the mother or cook has tu
berculosis.
- The sputum is consequently the
most dangerous source of tubercular
sis. 4'
The milk of a tubercular mother
seldom contains the germs, but the
infant is easily infected from the
mother's sputum, as already noted.
Cow's milk (also butter and cheese)
occasionally contain bacilli from
cows that have the disease even slight
ly.
The urine, feces and discharges
from tuberculosis sores may occasion
ally cause disease, but are less com
mon sources o fdanger owing to their
manner of disposal.
Infection takes place in three ways,
the first two being common: By in
halation through the mouth or nose, of
dust and spray; by swallowing both
the inhaled matter and contaminated
food; by inoculation into cuts or
scratches and through gums.
The European war is now scheduled
to end in 1917, though just when and
how the termination is. to be brought
about is wholly a matter of conjec
ture and speculation. Doubtless the
forces of General Prostration, General
Destitution and General High Cost of
Living will have asmuch to do with
concluding the struggle as the armies
in the field or the navies on the sea.
If you believe in helping those who
help you it's your duty to buy at
home.
IMPROVING CITRUS TREES.
Effort Being Made to Eliminate In
ferior trains.
More than 20Q/ 00 select fruit
bearing buds fr citrus trees with
known performance records have been
placed in the hands of co-operators
of the Bureau of Plant Industry, U.
S. Department of Agriculture, who
are to permit the Department to se
cure progeny records from the trees
so propagated. The purpose is to se
cure uniformity of strain of the trees
and the fruits borne by such trees.
This distribution follows extensive
taking of records of select trees of
the Washington naval and Valencia
oranges, Eureka, Lisbon, and Villa
Franca lemons, Marsh grapefruit, and
Dancy tangerine. The buds are sup
plied not merely for propagation of
nursery stock, but, in many cases,
for the top working of unprofitable
trees in established plantations.
Recently, in co-operation with the
California Fruit Growers' Exchange,
a systematic campaign has been un
dertaken to eliminate all of the in
ferior strains of grapefruit in Cali
fornia by top-working trees of such
strains with select buds from trees of
the Marsh variety, with known per
formance records, thus ing the
grapefruit producti ,. The state
practically to the bqo, Of a single va
riety. Each year s ea an increase in
the number of citrus growers in Cali
fornia who adopt the commercial tree
performance record system for locat
ing trees of unprofitable character,
eit er because they bear little fruit
of because they bear fruit of
a strain not well suited to commer
cial use. A second commercial nur
sery has been established during the
year in California for the purpose of
propagating trees from wood borne
by record individuals.
Of interest also to the citrus grow
er is the statement in the annual re
port of the chief of the Bureau of
Plant Industry that a machine has
been invented which successfully re
moves the oil-bearing portion of the
rind of waste and cull oranges and
other citrus fruits, thus making it
possible to eliminate a large part of
the expensive hand labor which has
heretofore rendered the domestic pro
duction of sweet-orange oil commer
cially unprofitable. This machine has
been patented and dedicated to the
public. There has also been de
vised a simple, practical, and in
expensive method of manufacturing
sweet-orange oil from the rind of
cull and waste fruit removed by the
machine mentioned.
Studies of the citrus scab, a dis
ease increasingly destructive in the
past few years in Florida, especially
in grapefruit groves, were under
taken. Spraying experiments indi
cate the possibility of satisfactorily
controlling it by thorough protection
of the young fruit.
VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
Women Elected Wilson.
Wonder what the Democratic party
vill do about it? And how about
he "stronghold of Democracy, the
iolid south?" Will it be "solid"
mnough to repay the western states
or the votes of women that kept the
Democratic party in power? The on
.y way is to give southern women the
)allot that they may repay by their
votes what they owe to the western
suffragists. Who's afraid of women's
votes now? Pipe up, "solid southern
ers!" Render to Mrs. Caesar of the
west the votes you owe her. The
western women, western men and
southern men can stand under the
banner of liberty. Only the southern
w en must be herded aside with
well, say, who are those denied votes
besides women in the south? Just
think the company over for a moment.
Montana Advertised.
Whether Monta''\ expected to
boom herself nationt . or whether
she is just naturally .the
times, she has certainly- ined
world-wide advertisement. The first
state to send a woman to congress is
a distinction in itself. But as a 1y
product Montana has secured more
notice than the keenest association
of commerce or board of boosters
could devise. The "lady from Mon
tana" in congress will be sort of a
standing advertisement for an enter
prising state during her time of office.
Death of Mrs. Inez Milholland
Boissevain.
The death of Mrs. Inez Milholland
Bois;evain will be deplored by many
suffragists. Her wonderful beauty,
high culture and fearless views made
her of great assistance to the cause of
woman suffrage. Those who were pri
vileged to witness the suffrage parade
in New York will remember the god
dess-like figure and statuesque beau
ty of Mrs. Boissevain, who rode at the
head of the column.
Southern Ring Defeats Women.
The leading, high-principled news
papers of Louisi a are denouncing
the ring politicianr of New Orleans
who defeated ti constitutional
amendment which uld have enabled
women of the state to serve on public
boards of charitable and educational
institutions. Wonder what western
men think when they read of this atti
tude toward women?
The latest news from Mexico is to
the effect that Gen. Villa, the elusive
and many-lived bandit, is making a
desperate attempt to capture the city
of Chihuahua, and that he has issued
an edict that all foreigners falling in
to his hands are to be killed. These
reports may or may not be true, as
the average political campaign lie is
usually a gentleman and a scholar
alongside the average Mexican news
item.
