the tie game between theUnoles
and Night-in-gales was played off,
on the Holy Rosary grounds Tues
day afternoon, and was won by the
latter ofter an exciting contest all
the way through.
In the beginning the Orioles ob
tained the advantage of 4 points,
but this was equalized by the
Night-in-gales before the end of the
first period, and thus at half time
the teams were a tie at 4.
The Orioles again took a lead of
2 in the second half, but were soon
overtaken by the Night in gales,
who eventually forged ahead by
making a basket from the field a
few seconds before full ttnie was
called. They were thus awarded
the honors of the court for their
well earned victory. Gladys Gotigh
capably refereed the game to the
entire satisfaction of Muriel Janes ,
and Agnes Begley. the captains of :
the respective teams

Russel Yowell's Cyclones journey- j
ed to the home grounds of H. B.
Mudd's Nil Desperandums Tuesday .
afternoon, to play a game of foot-!
ball. The game was not begun un-1
til long after the appointed time i
because of unsuccessful attempts
to thaw out some of the ought-to-be
players present.
It appears also that four Nil Des
perandums had previously anticipat
ed the coming storm and unsports
manlike, belittling the name, betook
themselves to cover, How they
read the signs we do not know, but
rumor had it that regions of the
heart their lower extremities were
frozen solid. Those who had less
Surface to protect stood their
ground like manly little men and
made possible at least the beginning
of the game. With that pluck and
courage that well bent a worthy
football captain who will not easily
shirk an engagement: the fearless
little leader H. B. Mudd decided to
play the game and took the kick off.
George Powers received the oval on
the bound and raced with It to the
Nil Desperandums 10 yard line.
On the next play Cliff Fitzgerald
circled around feft end for a touch i
down. A few minutes Inter the!
Cyclones, per James Nesbit added ;
six more points to their credit and ,
at this stage of the game a dispute
arose about the legality of a Nil
Desperandum substitute.
The referee decided in his favor
but the umpire at first protested
and then voted for him. The
Cyclones however refused to play
and the Nil Desperandums claimed
the game forfeited 1 to 0. The
referee did not view it that way
and and declared the game off, and ,
to be played during the Christmas j
holidays when the spirit of good ,
will might move both sides to make j
concessions in regard to stature In ;
passing it might besaid that while
the game lasted H B. Mudd, George
Mudd, R Wilson, Jim Moyers and
Packey McFararlaud did fine work
Almost A Fire.
Closet full of burning clothes
created quite a stir Thurs
day evening.
Judging from the smoke issuing
from the windows and doors of E.
J. Uourden's rooms in the Woodson
apartment, that building looked like
a goner But after the firemen locat
ed the blaze they found that after
all there was far more smoke than
fire. They found the clothes in a
closet to be burning and extinguish
ed by means of chemicals
No onewus in the building at the
time the fire was discovered. Mr.
and Mr. Bourden had left their
rooms just about 30 minutes before
the blaze was discovered and were
at the show. Mr. and Mrs. John
don's hunting coat.
Mr and Mrs. Bourdon lost prac
tically all of their clothing excepting
what they were wearing and a
couple of Mr. Bourdon's suits which
were in another part of the house.
Considerable damage was dune to
the curtains and rugs by the dense
smoke The front and bark doors
were both broken in by the fire
