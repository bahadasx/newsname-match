J archy, working sometimes directly

SiSS"
These, are distinguishing glories
of our liberal democracy and against
every orrn of thete. la.nc principle
and cllal safeguards of liberal de'
ntocracy. political l.'omanium in
Ameriia today is warring because
evrry one is in direct opposition to
the japal system of gorernmenl as
enunnated and upheld by every
pope.
Furthermore, while professing
loyalty and patriotism, Rome,
through her secret organizations,
her federated societies, and her
faithful sons, has during recent
years steadily and with increasing
boldness been warring in govern
ment and out, against freedom of
religious discussion, freedom
press, the principle of divorce of
church and state, and again' our
public free school system. Kvery
count in this indictment we stand
ready to establish by irrefutable,
present-day facts.
This is the vital icsue at stake.
Our claim i3 either true or it is
false. If true, no citien worthy of
this free republic can remain indif
ferent and bo quit of moral guilt.
If false, it is the bnunden duty as
well as privilege of Rome to come
out in the open, and to demand
full, free, and impartial investiga
tion, and to meet tnc-fseue as honest
men .meet all similar issues by
frank, fall, and free discussion of
every point. That is the democrat
ic method. That ia the method that
is welcomed by all people, societies,
or organisations conscious of the
truth of their claims or denials, but
that is the last thing Rome desires
because she knows that every count
in our indictment is true. "Hence,
she resorts to censorship, to boycott,
and to villifieation and slander of
all representatives of free democ
racy, substituting a campaign of
billingsgate and abuse for one of
calm reason, and full, fair, and free
discussion.
Furthermore, when Rome appeals
to the Protestant public through
her "chloroform committee,' she
does not adopt the only method by
which these fundamental issues ran
be discussed and intelligently
Judged, but she employs special lec
turers who select their ova topics
' milled to select hit own subject, to
1 substitute mrn of Mrtw for the real

General Funslon's autocratic po
sition is as opposed to Iht demo
cratic position as it is in perfect
harmony with the intolerant posi
tion of Home. It is th. transplant'
ing from Home of the practice of
the Index, and applying that un
democratic, progress paralyzing,
r.'ason fettering, and world blasting
influence iu the American public
life, and it is the boundcu duty of
every Christian and every patriot to
boldly, determinedly, and aggres
sively .opjxwe this anti-democratic
und pro-papal position of the
would-be military car in his iole
of censor of religion.
