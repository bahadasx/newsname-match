Political Reminiscences
(By James Petty)
In presenting the following, I
might say that I am not so much
imbued with the idea of writing
political history, as of relating a
few of this county's past performances
which seem to be unknown to many of
the present voters. I have no prej
udices or preferences in these state
ments, and may have overlooked items
of interest connected with the various
campaigns.
I broke into Stevens county politics
in 1893 by being sent to the first pop
ulist state convention at Ellensburg. In
that convention my colleague was a
negro preacher from Loon Lake and in
this convention we claimed the distinc
tion of putting Stevens county on the
political map of the state of Washing
ton. Since that time I have been a
close observer and have carefully noted
all the movements of the various polit
ical factions of the county, but have
only played a minor part in the game.
For many years prior to 1890, Stevens
county politics was c< ntrolled by a most
estimable citizen in the person of Jacob
Stitzel, sometimes called "Vinegar
Jake" by his opponents, because at odd
moments he made vinegar on his ranch.
Mr. Stitzel was a republican and in
tho.se days he not only dictated the pol
icies of local politics but also had a hand
in making up the slate for the various
county, legislative, and judical offices.

Jacob Ntitzel, a Pioneer
In 1890 it was found that the Stitzel
machine was working well and the court
house was filled with advocates of high
tariff. John L. Metcalf was elected as
representative from Stevens county to
the first working legislature of the
state of Washington. In this session
of the legislature a bitter senatorial con
test was on and Mr. Metcalf famed his
county and made himself notorious by
rising to his seat one day in the House
of Representatives and making this
statement: "Mr. President, I now hold
in my hand $500 given to me for my
vote for Mr. Calkins for United States
senator." The Stevens county repre
sentative then walked to the speaker's
desk and placed the valuable package
in front of the presiding officer.
Mr. Metcalf stated he never knew
what became of this money but was se
verely criticized by his constituents for
not keeping the money and then voting
as he pleased. Metcalf, or honest John
as he was afterwards called, never had
a chance to go to the legislature again.
In 1892 a great reform wave swept
over the county known as the Farmer's
Industrial Union, from which merged
the populist party, and in January, 1893,
the Middle-of-the-Roaders, as they were
called, elected Bob Hilts for con mission
er and J. O. Gifford for coroner, who
defeated Dr. M. R. Peck for that office.
At this time Dr. Peck was the only
real physician and surgeon north of
Spokane, and when the official count
was made the disappointed Dr. Peck
made this statement: "If I can't run
fast enough to beat a farmer with a
peg leg I will never run for office again."
It is said that the doctor forever after
made this statement good. The Pops
in this election sent to the legislature
Sam Derm who was then known as the
Hayseed Orator of Stevens county. He
made one speech on the floor of the
House of Representatives clad in over
alls and jumper, proposing the Govern
ment ownership of railroads, the elec
tion of United States Senators by pop
ular vote, the Initiative and Referen
dum, and many other political reforms.
This was the firßt and only speech the
Hayseed orator made in the legisla
ture.
The Populist wave ran high and in
January 1895 the court house was filled
with the Middle-of-the-Roaders and F.
I. Phelps was sent to the legislature,
who it is said fathered the first bill per
taining to the protection of game.
In the campaign of 18% a new party
was formed known as the silver re
publicans and in a county convention
assembled in Colville in September of
1 that year a fusion was formed in which
, the three parties, namely, the republic
; ana, the democrats, and the silver re
publicans were to COtnbtM their forces,
■ each being entitled to four of the twelve
county officials elected. The political
. issue in this campaign was the Gold
Standard and the free coinage of sil
;ver. Locally however the issue w;is
]tho <i. O. I'.s against the Pops.
', The lKflt; campaign in Stevens county
; will long be remembered as one fought
.With the most unscrupulous political
tentrigue; for example, the former hon
,'ept John L. Metcalf who was then the
auditor refused to place any of the
Bamea of the fusion candidates upon
■he official ballot. Whereupon a writ of
feandamus was issued by the itate su-
Breme court ordering the auditor to
■Teprint the bullots and place thereupon
all the names of the fusion candidates.
This order from the supreme court was
obeyed by the auditor but the new bal
lots with the fusion candidates' names
upon them were never delivered to the
pen 33 precincts in the county, but
'the original ballots were delivered on
tin- day preceding the election, on which
day over one thousand fusionists were
obliged to lick a dozen stickers each in
order to cast their ballot.
This act was commonly known as the
Great Political Outrage. The fusionUt
ticket was termed the Hydra Headed
Monster. The result of the election
divided the county spoils equally p . be
tween the Political Outragers and the
Hydra Headed Monsters. The oHicia!
fount showed many candidates were
nearly even in the outcome. For exam-
Be, Denny (Pop) defeated Ferguson
(Demi for sheriff by majority of five.
■Other candidates were close, conse
quently many contest cases were iiled
in the superior court in which the sher
iff's was made a test case. No mate
rial change wag made, however, from
the official count and that made by the
court.
('. A. Mantz (Pop) defeated W. C.
Gray (Rep) for state senator by a ma
jority of fourteen. This office was con
tested in the legislature in which the
official count was sustained and Mantz
was seated —the last populist member
(tf the legislature of the state of Wash
ington.
In 1898 the new court house was com
pleted and the oiiices were about equal
ly distributed between the republicans,
udjpriocratß and populistsi The fusion
ists were disolved and the Hydra Head
ed Monster was a thing of the past.
George Welty (Dem) was elected as
representative to the legislature by a
majority of one vote. It is said of Mr.
Welty that he only introduced one bill
and that was to reduce the age of con
sent from 18 to 16 years of age. This
bill, however, was never enacted into
law.
In 1890 the Silver wave had subsided
and the populists with their reform
measures were a thing of the past, and
the two old parties with their issue,
High Tariff and Free Trade, divided the
county plums about equally, with the
republicans a neck in the lead. This
state of political affairs throughout the
county haß not been materially changed
up to the present time. The legislative
ticket was as follows: In 1908 A. A.
Anderson (Rep) went to Olympia. In
1906 Stevens county was reclassified
entitling it to two representatives. In
this year John Kellogg i Rep) and M.
J. Malony (Dem) had seats in the low-
M. J. Maloney
er house. The 1907 legislature wart rep
resented by R. 1). McUae and A. W.
McMorran, republicans. In 1909 Henry
R. Spedden and K. A. Thayer, republi
cans, were sent to the legislature. And
by the work of these two men Stevens
county received an appropriation of
$40,000 for the far lamed state road
No. 2 that it is said "started nowhere
aiid terminated no place."
I(i 1911 Spedden was returned, with
Appleman his running mate. In 1918
Stevens county was represented by J,
C. Hutchinson and Walter Smith, dem
ocrat!.
In 1915 the county .sent to Olympia
C. R. McMillan (Dem) in the senate
and John OUon (Rep) and J. F. Jar-
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
vis (Dem) in the lower house. In this
session the two representatives clashed
on what is known as the bull bill. The
republican lielri that all bulls should be
allowed to run rampant on the range
while the democrat maintained that the
animals should be corralled or picketed
by a ring in the nose.
In lS9f> that portion of the Colville
Indian Reservation north of the Colum
bia river and east of the Kettle river
was opened for mining location. The
locating of mining during the following
summer was so extensive that fourteen
extra deputies under Auditor Metcalf
were required to file and record the
minrng location notices.
In IHitH Stevens county was divided,
and all that portion west of the Kettle
river and north of the Columbia was
set aside as Ferry county. In tran
scribing the Kerry county records Aud
itor I). C. Ely employed twelve of the
most popular young ladies of Stevens
county to assist in his work.
In 1909 Stevens county was again
divided, and all that section eust of the
summit of the Kalispell range was set
aside as Pi-nd Oreille county. Henry
R. Sp&dden secured the contract of
transcribing the records for the new
county.
According to the data at hand Henry
R. Speddcn was the only representative
from Stevens county who succeeded
himself.

('. K. McMillan
C. U. McMillan was sent to the legis
lature M a democrat in 1887, and after
28 years he is again representing his
county in the legislature, being elected
in 1914 an Henator on the democratic
ticket.
H. (!. Kirkpatrick, republican, has
served Stevens county as prosecuting
attorney for ten years at various inter
vals. It may be said of Mr. Kirkpat
rick thai he was never defeated for
office
T. E. Irish, populist, was elected
commissioner a short and a long term
making six years of continuous service.
J. F. Lavinge was elected treasurer
once as populiat and four years later as
a democrat for the same office.
S. S. Ueggs wss elected treasurer an
a populist and later served four years
as commissioner as a democrat. In
June, 191 r., Mr. Beggs received the ap
pointment of receiver of the U. S. land
office at Waterville.
The superintendents of schools for
the past twenty-five years havo always
succeeded themselves in ollice when
they so desired. W. L. Sax served al
most live years by reason of a change
in the nchool law.
The treasurer's office has been handed
down from principal to deputy for the
past sixteen years. George Seal after
serving four years handed his office
over to his deputy Charles Adams for
four yenrs more, whereupon Adams
turned over the county till to his dep
uty Bliss I'hillip < for another four years,
and in turn Phillips passed the job up
to Irving BUI, th<- present incurnbant.
In spi'e of the protest of the dem
ocrats who have continually cried "court
house ring" they have never been able
to break into this ring, butit is general
ly conceded that the treasurer's office
has alWHjs been filled by responsible
and competent men.
The judicary for the past quarter of
a century in the county has been con
ducted by the following jurists: First,
.lesse Arthur, democrat, four years;
William EC Richardson, populist, eight
years; Miles Poindexter, democrat, two
months; D. 11. Carey, republican, eight
yearn; W. H. Jackson, non-partisan,
four yearn.
THE WET AM) DRY MOVKMKNT
In i'MV.i the legislature passed a local
option bill and the same year the var
ious incorporated towns within the
county held special elections in which
ColvilW- and Ketlle Kails were voted
dry, while Marcus, Northport, Chewe
lah and Springditle remained under the
wet regieme.
In ItlO the county was voted dry by
a large majority hut no change wan
made in the incorporated towns.
For six years prior to lUlii the various
political particH .seemed to lay aside
their former political principles and de
vote their entire attention to the wet
and dry issue, and the various candl-

these lines. But in the election of 1915
statewide prohibition was adopted by n
referendum measure and apparently
the wet and dry question was forever
settled.
THE SOCIALIST MOVKMENT
In 1904 J. C. Harkness, a former
democrat, organized the socialist party
throughout the rounty with a full ticket
in the field which polled about 300 votes.
In 1908 the socialist party in Stevens
county polled a vote of 040. In 1912
the vote increased to 998. These figures
indicate from 18 to 18fl of the entire
vote of the county.
NEWSPAPERS
For many yearn there have been sev
en weekly newspapers published in the
county and as near aa can be determin
ed they now stand three democratic,
three republican, and one independent.
