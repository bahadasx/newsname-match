YOUTHFUL
BURGLAR
CAPTURED
Boy Fell Asleep on Job Which Led to Ar-
rest Also of His Older Pal,
Henry Wills
HAS TAKEN PART IN
OTHER HOLDUPS
Youngster Tells Thrilling Story of Crimes
Committed in Bowie
Texas
Crawling into a hole made in this
rear brick wall of Kreas's store and
for the purpose- of burglarizing it, and
then crawling under the counter to
take a nap, proved to be the undoing
of Roy Mulone, aged ten, and his pal,
Henry Wills, a grown man, who was
supposedly waiting on the outside.
The boy was arrested this morning
and proved to be the principal witness
against the man in his trial in the po
lice court at which time he was turn
ed over to the county on the charge
of burglary.
Several nights ago Roy, who is the
son of ilenry Malono, who formerly
ran a rooming house in Chickasha but
.now, resides in Oklahoma City, was
taken to the train by his father and
provided with a ticket to his home in
Oklahoma City. This was after having
had. an adventurous but. short career
at Bowie, T.Vxas.
According to the boy's story told
this morning, Wills, whom he had
met at Ryan, was'on the farther side
of tu train and, v.Ou Ore elder "it
lone left, the boy to go home. Wills
called to him asking him to come to
the platform on the side away from
the station where Wills could not be
seen. Wills told Roy that he knew
where there was some money. Roy
replied that he didn't want any money
but that he wanted to go home. He
declined to leave the train, whereup
on he was pulled off by Wills and af
ter making a detour of the town final
ly landed in the rear of Kress's closed
store, where, in a few minutes with
a cold chisel enough bricks were re
moved to permit of the entrance of
the boy into the building.
The elder burglar instructed the
child to first so to a certain part of
the store where he could get some
jewelry and a flash light and then to
go through the cash register and the
safe- and return to him when the job
was over.
A brick fell and disturbed the boy
who went to. the window and found
that he had been deserted by his elder
companion.
"I was tired and I crawled under
the counter and went to sleep," he told
the authoriti-B Innocently. He was
found about midnight by one of the
employes.
Assistant County Attorney Swan
was advised of the arrest and the
probability of a state or county case
growing out of it and was present at
the city court trial. Immediately up
on completing the evidence the assist
ant attorney asked that Wills be held
for the county officials and he was re
moved to jail. Roy is a very ready
guest of the sheriff's office, held there
on parole as a witness against Wills.
When seen by an Express represen
tative today the. boy told an interest
ing and rather rensational story which
may lead to further arrests and may
solve 'the mystery of several local bur
glaries. While in Oklahoma City recently John
Kelly, a sixteen-year-old boy, persuad
him to Bowie, Texas. Upon reaching
there Kelly procured a gun and start
ed out to work, accompanied by Roy.
He first entered a drug store trom
the rear door after hours and held
up the negro porter who was sweep
ing out. This netted the couple fif
teen cents. They then blew the safe
which yielded them nothing but sor
row. Then the pair pried open the door
of a hardware store and this netted
them a few knives, one of which was
found on Roy's person by the authori
ties making him "sore" because he
had gotten into trouble on Kelly's ac
count. Roy then stalled on his way
home to Oklahoma City but stopped

ANOTHER
DARING
HOLD-UP
White Man Waylaid by Two Whites and
Two Negroes in Two Street, and
RoLbed of Change
Another daring holdup was perpe
trated in Two street at It o'clock last
night, in which J. W. McCarty, a visi
tor to Chickasha, was knocked down
and robbed of $3.G5, the highwaymen,
however, missing a well filled purse
which was concealed in the sock of
their victim.
McCarty, with two men who were
arrested this morning by Officers
Baird and Elston, had been enjoying a
social drink and according to McCarty
they claimed to be his friends. They
were II. Class and M. Moran. They
volunteered to steer the visitor to a
place where a flask of whiskey could
be purchased and leading him into
Two street two negroes, as yet un
identified, knocked McCarty down and
it is charged one of the whit
went through his pockets while the
other did a good deal of talking about
how it should be done. Not satisfied
with their second search which reveal
ed an additional amount of small
change one of them suggested that
they take off his shoes. Had this
been done McCarty would have lost
his wallet.
Class and Moran were lodged in the
city, jail r.nd will ha!ve their trial be
fore Mayor Coffman this afternoon.
Police are In search of the two ne

IN EARNEST
Hard Fight Made by Both Towns Before
Grady County Highway Association
for Recognition
ENTHUSIASM SUSTAINED
BY OZARK TRAILERS
Chichasha ' y Divide Her Supporf Be
twtv.- .iwo lowns in spanning
- Canadian River
In a rousing meeting held by the
Grady County Highway association at
the Grady County Commercial and
Furni bin -ed 1-. lust night four salient
facts were developed: First, that a
spirited rivalry hud sprung up be
tween Tuttle nnd Mlneo for a place on
the routo in ne event of the Ozark
Trail coming, this way; second, that
not a single Chickasha committee was
ready to present, a tangible or con- .
crete report; third, that a disposition
was apparent In Chickasha to aid both
Minco and Pocasset or either In the
matter of the construction of a bridge
spanning the anadian and thereby
secure the Ozaik Trail or some other
trail, and fou-ta, that a better propo
sition than bumping over seven rail
road tracks on their entrance to
Chickasha should bo presented to the
Ozark Trailers highway inspection
committee when they are ready to
fi!k business.
Important action, however, resulted
from the meeHnr It was arranged
ttiat, pending further moves with re
ppoct to the construction of the bridge
across the Canadian that both the peo
ple of Minco and the residents ui Tut
;lo present their claims to Chickasha's
consideration in concrete form for sub
mission at a future meeting of the as
sociation in Chickasha..
It was also decided to send an In
spection committee to Minco to inves
tigate the claims presented by that
community for assistance in landing
both the bridge and the Ozark Trail.
Minco, a representative said, was
not using much hot air In presenting
her claims but was ready to come for
ward at any time with substantial
proof that she Is in earnest in reach
ing out for this privilege. The Mlnco
people had canvessed the matter In
detail and were ready to put up, with
assurances of support rom Chickasha
which had already been received, $10,
f00 toward the construction of the
bridge. They expected to get aid from
El Reno as well. For two years Ca
nadian county has stood ready to bear
her share of the burden with, Minco in
the construction of this bridge. The
Minco delegation was not in favor of
an expensive bridge, neither did they
believe it to be necessary, from the
data already at hand emanating from
soundings and other preliminaries
which had already been made. They
believed that a bridge such as la used
at Bridgeport would answer their pud
pose, that bridge costing only $20,000.
No estimate of the absolute or esti
mated cost of the Mlnco bridge could
bo furnished, however, pending the de
cision of those why buy the bonds to
determine ItB character.
Tuttle on the other hand, expected
to build the bridge largely with out
side aid. State and even national sup
port was suggested as well as support
from Oklahoma City.
A committee was appointed to visit
Minco and look over the situation, this
committee probably leaving here Sun
day for the purpose and being joined
by a portion of the committee which
had been appointed to visit Tuttle but
which did not complete its work.
Discussion on the necessity and ad
vantages of the bridge and also ttie
prospect of receiving national neip
and national support in case the pro
ject was put throui'Ji were engaged In
by several speakers. The opinion was
expressed that bo Tuttle and Minco
would not be chosen on the route as
that would necessitate a detour of
three miles in reaching Chickasha and
proceeding on the motorists' journey.
A disposition to aid both the Tuttle
people and the Minco delegation In
the matter of bridge construction was
indicated by the tenor of the infor
mal talk! which followed. It was
