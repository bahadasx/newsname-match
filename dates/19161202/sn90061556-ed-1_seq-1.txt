THE REPUBLICAN'S AWAKENING?
Through All These Years Negroes and Fair-minded White

The New York Sun, the Chicago Tribune, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat,
Kansas City Journal, Los Angeles Times; Ohio State Journal, Phil

are Vehemently Demanding that the Searchlight of In

WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT?
The unconstitutional and high-handed
methods that have been used by the
South during the past thirty years to
intimidate and deprive tho Southern
Negro of the Rights of Suffrage are
at last to bo investigated and what
the final results will be we cannot
today predict'. The South has openly
and swaggeringly boasted during the
recent years that it has deprived the.
Negro of the Right of Suffrage that

the recountal of whose "achieve

That the powerful Metropolitan
Press is becoming thoroughly aroused
is demonstrated by tho following edi

staid and conservative Kansas City
Journal which, while it has no par

injustice not only to tho Negro but
to the Constitutional law of this great

, THE "SOLID SOUTH" FRAUD.
, While federal investigation of al
leged election frauds, wnicn unuer xne
circumstances must have been rela
tively minor in scope, goes forward
with vigor at Cincinnati ana some om
eK centers, why is not the department
of justice equally concerned with the

South?
.With tho tatlt consent of the re
. malnder of the country that portion
ot tho United States which lies south
of tho Mason and Dixon line (its
franchises the majority of its legally
qualified voters because they aro Ne
groes. There are reasons for follow
ing this course which the white voters
of .the South believe sufficient. To
oiinw thft Necro to exercise tho full
and equal right of suffrage which, In
theory at least, he possesses would be
Bj
to turn over to him all of the ma
chinery of government in those com
monw.ealths in which his race is in the
majority; his would be the deciding
voice at all local elections. The ter
rible lesson of the reconstruction
period in this regard is not forgotten.
The North sympathizes with the
situation of the South to the extent
that no attempt is made to bring
pressure to bear to force compliance
with the law. There is no reason,
however, why the South should be
allowed to continue to cast an inflated
total of electoral votes based upon the
supposition that the Negroes are per
mitted to exercise the franchise, when
all the world knows they are not.
In the election of 1916, for instance,
the electoral ballots have not yet beeh
cast. If the "solid South" wero to be
permitted onljj that-number of elec
toral votes to which it is fairly en
titled Mr. Hughes and not Mr. Wil
son- would be the next President ot
the United States.
The constitution gives to each state
as many members of the electoral col-
lego as the sum of the number of its
senators and representatives in con
gress. Each state has two senators
and the number ot its representatives
is determined on tho basis ot its popu
lation as given in the last census. So
far, the South would seem to have a
right to all of its congressmen and
consequently to all of its electors,
whether the Negro were permitted to
vote or not. But the second paragraph
of tho Fourteenth amendment specifi
cally deals with such a condition. It
says:
nut when the right to vote
at nny election for the choice of elec
tors for President nad Vice-President
of the United States, representatives
in congress, the executive and Judicial
officers of a state, or tho members ot
the legislature thereof, is denied to

any of the male members of. such
state, being 21 years of age and citi
zens of the United States, or in any
way abridged, except for participation
in rebellion or other crime, the basis
of representation therein shall be re
duced in the proportion which the
number of such male citizens shall
bear to the whole number of male
citizens 21 years of age in such state,
That language is clear enough. If
all of the male citizens over legal age
are not permitted to vote, then the
electors shall be apportioned with re
gard to the number who are permit
ted to vote. If only white men can
cast a ballot In tho South, then the
South is entitled by the authority of
tho Fourteenth amendment only to
number of electors In proportion to
tho total white voting strength. The
Negro should not be barred from the
polls and then have his vote counted
In the electoral college as though it
had been cast.
The Fifteenth amendment is violat
ed in the South because the North
makes no adequate objection. The
Fourteenth has been safely disregard
ed for the same reason. With the
Democratic party in an apparently
hopeless minority elsewhere, in times
past It made little practical difference
it the South were allowed -to cast
more electoral votes, than the number
to which it was entitled. Even In
1912 little attention was paid in the
Republican ranks to this matter; the
defection of the Progressives was the
thing thta gave the Democrats the
victory.
Tho result in 1916 has been tod
close and too hard fought for it longer
to be possible to overlook the discrep
ancy between the South's popular
vote and its electoral vote. It is
fraud which has resulted in turning
tho election. Mr. Wilson will receive,
in tho electoral college many ballots
which can bo counted only In viola
tion olthe constitution.. It thesa.were
thrown out, as. tUey (should be, ho

To choose the PPresldent by popu
lar voto Is one waV to prevent the
South from exerting an Influence In
national elections to which It is not
entitled; the electoral college Is anti
quated. But In the' meantime the dis
play of righteousness which the ad
mlnjstrntion is making In going after
only hoso election thieves who oper
ate on a comparatively infinitesimal
scale in Cincinnati and elsewhere is
amusing. Why riot prosecute the
fraud that is practiced in the South

petrators do nol'iake the trouble to

sentation in the electoral college until

lar vote cast? Why Btrain at a gnat

ooking back on past rich experience
Of the heart, is like playing with em

Romance has sweet thrills long after
season -
Long passed, and it may be in soft
pathos
Or joy welding by fond recollection,
Reminiscences of the yesterday,
Or thru the long labrynth of pulsing
soul,
But even today has power to move
And will not be downed by Time's cir
cumstance. ,
Love has been hurt but its God not
dethroned.
But can we sing If we see or feel not?
Song without sympathy is blank dis

And life without romance is life not
But poor existence, it Is faint and sad.
There is sweetness in fondling o'er

Though which essence can never be
recalled,
Its sad ghost we might scarcely see
flitting
Away into night's gloomy recedence.

A THANKSGIVING CONFESSION.
By Benj. V. Longdon. ,
At this time of the year two sentl
ments very prop'erly find room in our
hearts, a sentiment of sorrow and
sentiment of gratitude. As we look
back upon the past twelve months we
find much to regret, much to sorrow
for. At times we have been weak,
timid, cowardly and even perhaps
mean. All this, of course, makes
dark picture and we, shall sorrow for
it but we shall not be sad. sadness
is never helpful. It enervates, weak
ens, discourages. Sorrow strength
ens, cheers and aids to reparation for
the past and the mending of our lives
for the future.
The second Bentlment that should
animate us at this time of year is
gratitude. "A certain widow was so
poor that she out the one
thin bed covering by laying an old
door over herself and her children.'
"Mamma," said one of the children
one bitter night, "what do those chil
dren do who haven't got a door to
cover them?" Our hearts should be
full to overflowing for the tens of
thousands ot favors and graces given
us since last Thanksgiving Day. This
gratitude will show Itself not in use
less ripenings, not in discouragement!
but in loving energetlo fidelity
to
daily duties in the unborn years that
are in, God's Providence to como to
us. Wo begin today with a, tear of
sorrow and a smile of courage, with
a sigh of regret and a song ot joy,
"I have a room wherelnto no one
enters,
Save myself alone;
There sits a blessed memory on a
throne,
Thereby life centers."
ANTHONY
New York, Nov. 22. Gov. Richard
I. Manning, of South Carolina, as a
result of the recent lynching of An
thony Crawford, at Abbeville, has
taken a stand which promises to clear
the name of his state of the stigma
which attached to it during the ad
ministration of his predecessor, the
notorious Cole Blease. Governor Man
ning, in a statement given out to the
press on the day before election, says;
"I was out of the state when the
Abbeville lynching occurred. As soon
as I learned of it I called Solicitor R.
A. Cooper and Sheriff R. M. Burts of
Abbeville to the office and called on
Coroner F. W. R. Nance of Abbey
vllle county to comply with the law
and furnish me with a copy of the
testimony taken at the coroner's in
quest. I found that the coroner held
an inquest, but took no testimony.
Solicitor Cooper and Sheriff Burts
came to my office and I requested
them to secure the names of all par
ties connected with this affair, those
ho .took part in the whipping, in the
taking of the Negro from the jail, in
the lynching, and all those who were
at the meeting reported to have been
held on the following Monday. I have
requested Solicitor Cooper and Sheriff
Burts to make a complete investiga
tion of the whole matter and get the
names of all parties concerned and to
swear out warrants and arrest them,
I intend to do everything in my
power to uphold the law and let the
offenders know that such acts will not
be tolerated, and that those guilty of
violating the law must suffer for it,
have requested Solicitor Cooper as
the state's representative and Sheriff
Burts as the highest peace officer in I
the county, to leave no stone unturned j
in order to vindicate (he law and all
the powers of the governor's office
are at their disposal in bringing the
guilty ones to justice."
The lynching referred to occurred
on October 21 in one of South Caro
lina's most beuatiful and progressive
cities. Anthony Crawford, the victim,
was a Negro fifty-one years old worth
over $20,000. He got into a row with
a white storekeeper named Barksdale
over the price of cottonseed. It is re
ported that Mr. Barksdale called him
Har and the Negro cursed him
roundly in return, whereupon a clerk
ran out to give Craiwford a beating
with an ax handle. He was saved
from this by a policeman who arrest
ed Crawford and took film to the mu
nicipal building, but when they let
him out on bail a crowd of men took
after him again intent intent on pun
ishing him for daring to curse a white
man.
Tho day a white man hits me is
the day I die," Anthony Crawford once
said to a friend. When he saw the
crowd coming after him, he went down
in the boiler room of the gin, picked
up a four-pound hammer and waited.
The first man who came at him, Mc-
Kinney Cann, received a blow in the
head which fractured his skull, but
someone hurled a stone which knock
ed out Crawford before he reached
anyone else. While he was down, they
knifed him in the back and kicked
him until they thought they had fin
ished him, when they permitted the
sheriff to arrest the unconscious
Crawford on condition that he would
not take his prisoner out of town un
til they knew whether Cann would
live or die.
Cann wasn't hurt as badly as they
thought, but nevertheless a mob went
back to the jail at four o'clock that
afternoon, took their keys and guns
away from the sheriff and Jailor,
dragged Crawford through the streets
of the Negro quarter with a rope
around his neck, hung his mutilated
body to a pine tree at the entrance
to the fair grounds, and expended a
couple of hundred rounds ot ammuni
tion at It.
On Monday a meeting was called In
the Abbeville courthouse at which It
was decided to order the sixteen sons
and daughters ot Crawford and their
families to abandon their $20,000
home and get out of the state by No
vember 15, After the meeting this
mob proceeded to close up all the Ne
gro shops in Abbeville.

editorial, pointed out that in view oC
the exodus of Negro labor from tho
South to northern industrial fields
and tho approach of the boll weevil.
South Carolina's problem was to keen .
her colored men Instead of serving
notice on them that no matter how
industrious or successful they might
be, their case was absolutely hope
less. It so convinced the business
men of Abbeville that they had lynch
ed their own pocketbooks, that on
November 6 another meeting was held
in the court, house at which the fol
lowing resolutions were unanimously
passed:
"We, the citizens of the city of Ab
beville, in mass meeting assembled,
do hereby express in unqualified
terms our disapproval of the recent
violent acts of certain persons com
mitted in our community, and tho
spirit of lawlessness that seems rife
in the county, resulting in continued
acts of lawlessness it is,
"Reolved: That the Sheriff ot Abbe
ville county, the Mayor of Abbeville,
the Police Force, and every officer of
the county and city, be urged to uso
every effort to enforce the law and
to protect the citizens of the town
and county regardless of condition or
color.
"Resolved Further, tfThat we do
hereby pledge ourselves as individuals
to give to the officers of the law our
physical support in 'maintaining tho
law.
"Resolved Further, That if.it bo
necessary to carry out this determi
nation that the aid of the State and
Federal uovernment be called in or
der that every citizen may enjoy his
rights under the constitution.
"Resolved Further, That a commit
tee with Capt. J. L. Perrin as Chair
man, be appointed for the purpose of
ascertaining what can be done to
wards the organization of a local mili
tary company for the protection ot
the citizens of this county and for
maintaining order in our midst. That
this committee be empowered to act
in tho premises.
"Resolved, Further, That every citi-
zen of the town of Abbeville be as
sured the protection of the men ot
this meeting as long as he obeys the
laws of the state, and pursues only
his own legitimate business.
"Resolved Further, That a meeting
of the law-abiding citizens of Abbe
ville county be called to meet In this
court house on next Monday at noon
to perfect an organization for enforc
ing law and order in this county, and
that every community In the county
be represented at this' meeting, and
that steps be taken to show to tho
people of the state and United States $'
that the men of Abbeville- county will
defend the law, and protect the citi
zens of the commonwealth in the en
joyment of all rights, guaranteed by
the law."
At the meeting on November 13 tho
above resolutions were endorsed by
prominent citizens from all parts of
tho county, and a committee of twelve
men are to be appointed, "who shalL
have for their duties the furtherance
ot the ends sought by the meeting,
by taking up with the citizens of tho
county the matters discussed and en
deavoring to bring about a proper
understanding between the people of
the county, and a due observance ot
the laws of the land."
As a further guarantee that the
Crawford family is to be defended in.
their right to live in South Carolina
and enjoy the property accumulated
by three generations. Governor Man
ning has written Mr, Oswald Garrison,
Villard, vice-president of the Nation
al Association for the Advancement
of Colored People as follows:
"I realize the gravity of this offenso
and am determined to do everything
in my power to bring tho offenders
to justice. I have called on the SherltC
ot Abbeville county to take the neces
sary steps to prevent nny unlawful
action with regard to tho expulsion ot
the family of Crawford.
"I am giving serious consideration,
to this matter with a view to making
recommendations to tho Legislature,
so ns, tobo able to deal with such coar
ditions when they arise,"
