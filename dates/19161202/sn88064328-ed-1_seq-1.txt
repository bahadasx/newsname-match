The annual day «»f stocktaking. An' inventory pre
seiited in terms of energy, endeavor, exertion. If it were
only a record of cold figures, of balances of trade, of hank
balances, of factories, oil wells, mines and minerals and
other countless material acci mutations, the proclamation
by the President for the obsei vance of the day and the vol
untary worship by tbe people would become a hollow mock
ery. a reverence to Baal. A nation built on the idealism of
a free Democracy, on the liheities aqd justice of humanity
could not. endure nm assets of greeel, of the selfishness of a
provincial nationalism. The foundation strikes deeper into
the philosophy of life, the mo al forces of an imperishable
civilization.
The däv 's dedicated to tl e Natioti's nobler nature. The
loftier impulses of the nntiona life find for one day their em
phatic assertion. Plan's rights, social justice, spiritual
exaltation, faith in the invi ible a»urces in which the
anchors of national genius are firmly planted, an assertion
of equality of opportunity and privilege of every member
of the human race, are tiK canons that, complete the con
secration of the soul of the republic.
The repudiation of histo y's tradition, the condemna
tion of the slavery of feuda'ism and the economic grind
of the common mass of hum aity is eclipsed by the com
pelling achievement of man's freedom and the triumphs of
peace. The Tnited States, our country, with its fabulous
potential wealth and strength, material, moral and spirit
ual is the livinor hymn chsiited as appeal in? prayers fo»*
this, orr day of true religion.

that farmer^jiaving exceptionally
