FARM LOAN
TO SIT IN C
?
Where Jt Will Hold a Hearing of
Great Importance to the
Farmers in the State.
CSPrCIAL. TO THI TILta.AM)
WASHINGTON*. Dec. 2?A hearing
of great importance to the farmers and
farm organizations of West Virginia
will he held at Charleston December
9 by the federal farm loan board.
This hearing is for the purpose of
getting information to guide the board
in determining the boundaries of the
twelve federal land bank districts into
which the country is to be divided for
the administration of the new rural
credits law. known as the federal farm
loan act. The session will be held in
the federal building at Charleston.
The members of the federal farm
loan board who will conduct this hearing
are the Hon. William G. iMcAdoo,
secretary of the treasury; George W.
Norris. farm loan commissioner, Herbert
Quick, Captain W. S. A. Smith and
Charles E. Lobdell.
The board has issued an invitation
to all farmers and farm organizations
of West Virginia to attend this hearing
to get information about the operation
of the farm loan act. and to furnish
the board with information about the
farm loan needs of the state. It has
also asked interested cities to present
their claims for the location of one of
the twelve federal land hanks.
Farmers will be asked to give information
regarding the prevailing
rates of interest on first mortgage
loans: the difficulty of getting extensions,
the rate of commissions charged,
the development of farms as affected
by credit, farm tenantry as affected by
the ability of tenants to borrow, and
any other fact that will give the board
an understanding of the farm needs of,
the state.
The new federal farm loan act provides
a -way for the farmer or prospective
farmer to borrow money on long
rime mortgages at actual cost. The
Government provides the machinery
I top assembling capital to be loaned to
farm owners or prospective farm owners.
The loans may run up to nrty
per cent of the value of the land used,
as security and twenty per cent of the j
value of the improvements. The loans i
will be made at a low rate of interest
not yet determined, but it will be less
than six per cent. Provision is made
for the borrower to pay off the debt,
interest, and principal through periods
of from five to forty years, at his own
, option.
The legislation is expected to provo
a great boon to those sections of the

been retarded because of high Interest
rates, and it is predicted that it wilt
tend to make agricultural prosperity
permanent and uniform, stabilize and
equalize interest rates, and greatly improve
the condition of the farmer.
The nation wide interest in the provisions
of the bill is indicated by the
fact that more than 100,000 inquiries
have come to the treasury department
