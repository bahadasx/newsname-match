tives of the rival routes to go
with me on the same conditions
as heretofore stated so that the
representative of the rival routes
may hear all that is told to me
and see all that is shown to me.
No private or confidential state
ments will be received and any
letters written to me on the sub
ject will be made public. It will
of course be very bad form for
anyone who does not wish to take
sides publicly to attempt to get
any information to me on a con
fidential basis, and will only pre
judice his own case by attempt
ing to do so.
The Jefferson Highway is the
most important single enterprise
ever offered to any of the com
munities in this contest and the
decision to be rendered will be
based on the facts brought out
by the examination. It is our de
sire to so conduct this contest as
to arouse sufficient public inter
est in road building to construct
all the roads iLk the contest, al
though but one can take our
marks and signs.
The decision will be made on
Monday, December 18, 1916, at
the parlors of the Association of
Commerce in New Orleans.
It will be very desirable and
expedite matters for each route
to organize all the way through
on each contest' with one man in
charge of arrangements, other
wise the relay may break down
and interfere with the examina
tion.

Pursuant to call about thirty
citizens of Colfax and members
of the Grant Parish Jefferson
Highway association assembled
in the lobby of the Brinker Hotel
Thursday. Nov. 30, at 7:30 p. m.
to take action relative to securing
the services of Mr. J. D. Clark
son in scoring the proposed route
of the Jefferson Highway from
Colfax to Alexandria, via Bagdad
and Pineville.
Capt. C. H. Teal, president of
the association, called the meet
ing to order, and H. G. Goodwyn,
secretary, was called on to read
a couple of letters relative to the
subject at hand.
After considerable discussion,
participated in by several Colfax
citizens, and also Messrs. Winnie
Barrett of Pineville, and T. C.
Bush of Fairmount, it was de
cided that the chair appoint a
delegation to wait on Mr. Clark
son and inform him that it was
the earnest request and desire of
the citizens of Grant parish for
him to log and score the route
from Colfax to Alexandria by
way of Bagdad and Pinebille, it
being the most direct and practi
cal route between the two points.
The chair appointed as said del

Williams, J. H. McNeely, W.

Hog Cholera.
There is so much hog cholera
scattered over the parish that
we should take the necessary
steps to be employed, in keeping
this disease out of our communi
ty and out of our herd.
Hog cholera is now reported in
the Bagdad settlement, and near
Montgomery and Verda, and at
Bob southeast of Pollock. The
present outbreak of cholera is of
the chronic type, and is so much
different from the old acute type
of cholera that it is easy for us
to assume that the disease is not
really cholera. *
The main symptoms for us to
watch for in our herds are gum
my eyes, lack of appetite, diar
rhoea, constipation, a staggering
gait, and a continual falling off
of flesh. The hogs are sick from
three days to three months, and
some of them get well. The di
sease is only slowly contagious
from one animal to another in
the herd.
For prevention, isolate the sick
animals, burn all carcasses, kill
the buzzards, and keep the cur
dog off your premises. Vacci
nate all well animals. Remem
ber that'it seldom pays to vacci
nate any after they have become
sick. If your hogs are sick get
in touch with your demonstration

Grant Gis 3423 Bale of Cotto up to
November It
The tabulation of the card re
ports shows that ther were 3423
bales of cotton, counting round
as half bales, ginned in Grant
i'p arish from the crop of 1916 prior
to November 14, as compared
with 190) bales ginned to Novea
,ber 14, 1916,
It was decided that C. H. Teal
and H. G. Goodwyn are ex-officio
members of the delegation.
On motion the chaff also ap
pointed a delegation of five Ra
pides citizens, with the request
that they act in concert with the
Grant parish delegation in pre
senting the Pineville- Bagdad
route to Mr. Clarkson. The Ra
pides delegation is as follows:
Winnie Barrett, L. E. Litton, B.
F. Eubanks, S. R. Lee and Robt.
Golf.
The consensus of opinion ex
pressed was that the north side
of Red river was the shortest and
best route from every point of
view, being above overflow, con
venient to and passing through
beds of gravel that can be used
for constructien, and the Jeffer
son Highway manager only need
have his attention directed to
its advantages by the delegation
to convince his judgment and se
cure his approval of this logical
route for the road.
Attorney J. A. Williams in a
ringing speech of five minutes
recounted the advantages of the
Bagdad-Pinevil(e route without
aspers'ng the motives of any
working for the road, and was
heartily applauded for his talk.
The meeting then adjourned
subject to call of the chair.

Direct Elections.
The New York World has sub
mitted to many prominent men,
including members of Congress,
the question whether they are in
favor of the election of President
by popular vote. The Grt gifty
replies show a sharp division of
opinion. Ex-President Taft, ex
Senator Edmunds, ex-JudgeGeo.
Gray and President Nicholas
Murray Butler, of Columbia, are
irreconcilably opposed to the
abolishment of the Electoral Col
lege and Dr. Eliot of Harvard is
inclined to think the change un
desirable.
Various senators, reprentatives
and governors likewise put them
selves down for maintaining the
present system. Most of them
think that abolishment of the
college would be destructive of
the right of each State to express
its will in the choice of the Presi
dent, as the makers of the con
stitution intended it should.
From a southern standpoint,
one of the most significant facts
in connection with these expres
sions of opinion is the agreement
of so many of writers that
direct election imost have as its
fundamental basis uniform suf
frage throughout the country
no discrimination against any
class by reason of sex or color,
race or previous conditions
The southerners quoted all take
practically the same stand. They
are opposed to a surrender of
the rights of the States or to the
enforcement of manhood suf-t
frage: and with the South united
and the rest of the country likely
to be very much divided, there
doesn't seem to be vqry rosy
prospect for the praooed change
in the onstitution.-N. 0. Staters.

A comprehensive colonization
plan advanced by the Southern
Pine association for the settle
of approximately 25,000,000 acres
of cut-over timber lands lying
between Alabama and texas
constitutes a most importsat aid
o development of the south in
general, is the opinion of J. H.
Kirby of Houston, president of
the Kirby Lumber company; Mr.
Kirby is here attending a meet.
ing of mill managers and super.
intendents of the various Kirby
company plants. It is the rega.
lar meeting of the heads of the
corporation with the men who
are in charge of their proper
ties.
The colodfisation scheme was
first promulgated by land owners
who are members of the BSouth
eyn Pine asssociation. The sasO.
eliation then took the matter up
and now it is being directed with
J. E. Rhodes of New Orleans,
secretary of the association, at
its head. Mr. Kirby believes the
colonization of this vast area
which seems possible under the
plan of the association, will be
of great benefit to the south.
Muck of the land, in fact ome
half of it. is east of the Miss.lp:,
pi, being in Alabama, Missismlp
pi and Tennessee, the remainder
being on this side of the river i
Louisiana, Arkansas and Texua
The movement to Inttle cuat over
lands is practicaly new, in that
a few years age there was dmbt
as to whether these lands weow
prove productive. Tests in Te'ls
as well as in other state hav
proven it most productive. The
Kirby corporation has been tmE.
ward in urging the settlement at
this land, particularly in that its
plan is to buy vegetabloes ~
fruits for its various storm rs.
