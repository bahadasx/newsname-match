RUMANIANS MAKING
A STIFF
Teutonic Advance Continues to Press toe Closely
to the Rumanian Capital
MACKENSEN'S ARMY ON
The Russians Continue Aggressively Their Offensive Against
the Austro-German Lines From the Carpathians to
Southern Transylvania The Fighting in Dobrudja Has
Become More Tense In Galicia Ther j Has Been a Re
newal of Activity Admiral Duf ournet is Reported to
Have Landed Troops at Piraeus, the Port of Athens
No Important Changes Are Reported on the Other
Fronts.
Desperately the Rumanians, prob
ably aided by Russian troops, are de
fending the southern and western ap
proaches to Bucharest, while the Teu
tonic advance continues to press more
closely on the Rumanian capital from
Che northwest. Unofficially it is re-
Sorted In London that Russian troops
ave arrived in Bucharest to aid the
bard-pressed Rumanian forces.
Progress for the advancing German
nd Austro-Hungaiian armies in Wal
tachta and south of Bucharest is re
ported by Berlin, which says the Ru
manians continue to offer resistance.
The Rumanians apparently are on or
near the line of the Argesbu, as Pe
trograd eayii the Invaders have occu
pied two towns south of Bucharest
and near that river. Field Marshal
yon Mackensen, Berlin records, has
thrown an army across the Nlaslov
lowlands, which would be approach
ing the Argeehn in the direction of
Bucharest.
Advancing southward from the Cam-pulung-Plleshtl
region, the Teuton inT
vaders have taken prisoners and can
non and much other equipment from
tie retiring Rumanians. In the fight
ing reported in the latest communica
tions, Berlin says the Rumanians lost
more than 2,800 prisoners and 21 can
non. The Russians continue aggressively
their offensive against -the -.Austro-German
lines from the Carpathians to
southern Transylvania. Berlin states
the Russian attacks, Which are de
clared to have been along a front of
188 miles from Jabolnitza to Kedzl
Vasarhely, resulted only in small ad
vantages which are declared not to be
commensurate with the cost In men
and ammunition. Petrograd admits a
repulse southwest of Vakarka In the
Canpathlana but records the capture
of a ridge of heights south of Kirli
baba. , :.
AMERICAN SPEECH NOT
INFERIOR TO ENGLISH
Opinion of Prof. Frederick M. Ccott
of University of Michigan.
New York. Deo. 1. 'Because Ameri
can speech has no uniformity does not
Kove that It is inferior to that of the
lgllab people in the opinion of Pro
fessor Frederick M. Scott, of the Uni
versity of Michigan, who spoke today
at the annual convention of the Na
tional Council of Teachers of English.
He Insisted that "dawg" is just as
food a pronunciation as "dog." Uni
ofrmity la not important, he declared,
but speech should be sincere and show
culture.
The beautiful dialect of the south -trnerf
need no longer be defended,"
aid Professor Scott. "New England,
formerly supposed to govern in choice
f dialect, no longer helds that honor
I have noticed that the most culti
vated New Bnglander holds that hon
r. I have noticed that the most cul
tivated New Bnglander. when he
urarms up, pronounces his r" just as
llBtinctly as his p and q".
We must cultivate the poised in
telligent, sincere personality and the
roice which will fitly express that
personality."
Professor William A. Neilson, of the
lepartment of English literature at
Harvard spoke on "The Curse of Mem
ory." "It is only a curse," he said,
"when It allowed to take the place of
real thinking, imagination and ex
i presslon. The modern idea is that
memory Is not a storehouse in which
to place parcels not to be used until
taken out, but rather an incubator in
which you place the eggs and from
whoch you extract the chicks.
"We ought to train our memory be
cause it is useful in many ways but
we must also use it as a means and
not as an end."

Rumania is Causing Grave Regret.
London, Dee. 1, 6.30 p. m. "The war
must be fought to a military conclu

the blockade playing only a secondary
part," said Lord Robert Cecil, minister
of war trade, in discussion today with
The Associated Press the latest de
velopments in the world conflict.
" "The condition of Rumarnia," Lord
Robert continued, "causes us grave re
gret. But there is no reason to sup
pose the operations there will affect
pose the opeations there will affect
the result of the war, which must be
fought out on the main fronts. The
conditions under which we will accept

Washington, Dec. 1. What effect

CATTLE DISEASE IN KANSAS
DIAGNOSED AS STOMATITIS
Suspected Foot and Mouth Disease is
in Reality a Comparatively Harmless
Malady.
"Washington, Dec. 1. Laboratory in
vestigations completed here today
confirm that the ailment among cat
tle at Kansas City, suspected of be
ing foot and mouth disease, is stoma
titis, a comparatively harmless mal
ady easily cured.
The disease, a department of agri
culture statement says, is known in
Europe and South Africa and has been
found occasionally before in the Unit
ed States. It is contagious but ani
mals affected usually recover within
eight or ten days. "The present out
break," the statement says, "is the
most extensive yet noted In this coun
try. The specialists of the depart
ment, therefore, are advising state
livestock officials in whose territory
the disease is found, to impose local
quarantines to prevent its ' spread.
They advise all owners and handlers
of horses and cattle, (particularly liv
erymen, managers of stock yards, and
breeders, to separate sick from well
animals, to clean up and disinfect
their premises and to wash out the
mouths of sick animals with a weak
solution of permangate - of potash or

ATLANTIC FLEET NEEDS
AN ADEQUATE FLEET BASE
Captain Jonah McKean So Informs
House Naval Committee.
"Washington, Dec. 1. The Atlantic
Beet needs an adequate fleet base on
Chesapeake bay. Captain Johaji Mc
Kean, aide for material to the chief
of operations, told the house naval
committee today. He urged purchase
of the old Jamestown exposition site,
facing the broad anchorage ground in
Hampton Roads for the purpose. Cap
tain McKean appeared to explain es
timates of $5,133,000 for the air ser
vice and since there would be an avi
ation field at the proposed base, he
went into the plan in some detail, al
though the navy department has not
yet recommended to congress any ac
tion on the project. The owners ask
$1,400,000 for the , exposition land,
which includes about 640 acres, Cap
tain McKean said. Chairman Padgett
remarked that such a figure would
mean a wide margin oT profit, but the
officer thought the facilities offered Cor
sale were wotfcbe price.

Advertising Will Bring the Buyers
The location of a store is of much importance in the development
of business. The center of a community, where the most people pass
the door, is highly desirable because the window displays are most
valuable in attracting the attention of possible purchasers to the va
riety of goods which are carried within. They interest those who may
be anxious to buy then or later, but it is to be remembered that they
are of value solely to those who pass that way.
To depend upon that means of informing the people of trade op
portunities is not to follow the advice of the experienced business
man. He knows that he wants to reach a much larger number of
people than those who actually pass his door and who stop to look.
He wants to talk to all within a trading radius of his place of busi
ness and he has come to recognize that the best and cheapest method
of so doing is through newspaper advertising, and in this community
the leading medium is The Bulletin. It makes little difference whether
your store is on the main or a side street. If you advertise the buyers
will find you. Make The Bulletin your show window,, set forth your
appeal in black and white and note the results.

Baron Beresford advocated continual
aerial attacks on the German base at
Zeebrugge and the arming of mer
chantmen and contonued:
"It is a most unsatisfactory state of
affairs. Thousands of tons of food
which were waiting to come to Eng
land have been diverted to Germany."
The meeting adouted a resolution
calling for a more effective blockade
and for more efficient measures to
deal with the submarine question.
Naval Policy Denounced.
Strong denunciation of the govern
ment and its naval policy were made
at the meeting, which was attended
by representatives of the shipping and
mercantile community of London.
Thomas Gibson Bowles, who follow
ed Baron Beresford, made a vigorous
indictment of the government, demand
ing new men and a new mind at the
admiralty. He likened the admiralty
to a Jericho, whose walls had fallen
"to the trumpet announcing this meet
ing." Mr. Bowles added:
"Unless the submarine menace is
dealt with, we shall be blockaded as
well as Germany and privation and
famine prices will ensue, i can see
no glimmer of an overture for peace,
but if overtures for an honorame
peace should come with sufficient
guarantees it will be the duty of this
government to examine them. I have
arrived at the conclusion, ( however,
that this government is more able to
make peace than it is to make war."
The speaker demanded its dissolu
tion, declaring that the present coali
tion ministry was the creation of a
parliament more worn out than it was
itself. The speeches were punctuated
with shouts, of 'turn them out," and
similar phrases.

RESULT OF FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ATTITUDE
Recall Came as a Surprise, as All

Treasury Bills Were Intended as a Credit Medium That

New : York.- Dec. 1. The withdrawal -ly
J. P. Morgan & company of the
proposed sale of a limited amount of
short term British and French treas
ury bills at the request of the allied
governments, announced here today,
came as a surprise to the financial
community. The announcement issued
from the Morgan offices stated that the
action of the- British and French gov
ernments was taken eut of regard for
the attitude adopted against the sale
by the federal trade board. The sur
prise was heightened by the fact that
all arrangements for the offering had
oeen perfected.
Other Plans Uno'er Consideration.
Other plans to finance the pressing
needs of the British and French gov
ernments are already under way, it is
understood, but they have not yet
reached a definite stage. A member of
the Morgan firm informally; stated that
no other plans had bem (formulated.
but it was learred -from reliable
sources that the denial-had been made
as a matter of policy. The plans un
der contemplation, it is intimated, will
involve a large amount of "dollar
credits" available to Great Britain, if
not to her chief ally.
British institutions and private in
vestors still retain large amounts of
American securities, although they
have been largely mobilized by the
British treasury. There have been no
cancellations of orders for war sup
plies or any other materials to the
countries of the entente allies, accord
ing to the bankers acting for their
interests, and no appreciable diminu
tion of orders is expected.
The British government continues to
hold large -reserves of gold in Canada
and the more remote colonies, and

The announcement was contained in
the following statement:
SPEAKER CLARK'S PLAN
TO EXPEDITE LEGISLATION
Would Eliminate Useless Oratory and
Abolish Congressional Record.
Washington, Dec. 1. Speaker Clark
said today that if congress wanted to
clean the legislative slate and go home
next March 4, he gladly would join
in a movement to eliminate useless
oratory by cutting down gailcry space
and abolishing the Congressional Rec
ord and to introduce voting m.ichines.
"It isn't difficult to see that ths gal
leries and the Record cause an awfui
waste of time and money," the speak
er declared today as he paused in hia
efforts to outline a' p.an whereby a
session's work can be done in 63 leg
islative days. "Any time. that the gal
leries are full the orators on the floor
are posing and wasting time. And
everybody knows -there are any num
ber of congressmen who talk for the
Record a great deal more than is nec
essary. "The Record isn't necessary. The
English house of commons has none.
A journal is kept. Dr. Johnson used
to write it after the day's proceedings
were over. He simply recorded who
spoke and which side they were on.
"I haven't much hope, though, that
I'd receive much support if I started
to make a fight for smaller galleries
and no record, so I won't start it. But
there is hope that the present method
of taking roll calls will be abolished.
It is archaic and a time waste."
The speaker also favors reducing the
house from 436 to 309 members and
holding it to that number.
Minority Leader Mann today, ex
pressed the" view, and offered figures
to substantiate it, that under no cir
cumstances could the democrats have
a majority in the next house, but that
there was a chance for the republi
cans to have 218 members. He fur
ther said that he was not worrying
about the speakership and thought it
would be much more fun to remain
on his present job.

the wheat market, some special brands

Arrangements for Offering
Wo have been instructed - bv - the
British and French governments to '
withdraw their treasury bills from .
sale.
"We have accordingly expressed to
those institutions and investors which
had already placed orders with us for '
these securities the wish to be re
leasied from thjs obligation to deliver,
and they have been good enough to ac-
cedo.
"This action is because, as explain"
ed by the British chancellor of the ex
chequer and by the French minister of
finance, these governments desire to
show every-, regard to -the federal re
serve board, a governmental body of
which the secretary of the treasury
and ' the comptroller of the currency
ore ex -officio members.
Intended as a Credit Medium.
"We may add that the sale in lim
ited amount of these treasury" bllla -payable
in dollars in New York have
never been an essential part of the aT
lied governments' financial plant, b X
have for some time been under cor.
sideration with a view to furnishing, a
credit medium that would accommo
date the American bankng demands
for an instrument of short maturity
and of such limited volume that the
government could always undertake to
lay down gold in New York sufficient
to meet the matured bills..- ...
"It was believed further ..that these
bills would have furnished at the end
of the war an excellent measure of
protection to the American' financial
situation inasmuch as these steadily
maturing obligations of the foreign
governments would have -tended' fca
prevent heavy drafta of gold, from this
market.' - -
NoPtlisr Plane Formulated. - '
An informal statement was rmade by .
a member of the Morgan company that
no other financial plans-, have been?
formulated in place of the ones aban- -doned.

against her brother, John Edward Tel-'
per, on trial for the murder of their
mother. Mrs. Agnes Tieper. in the Or- -chard
Park road last January. That

had reported to the court that- Miss
Teiper, only survivor of the tragedv
except the defendant in this trial, had
no recollection of the events contain
ed with the) murders. ..
The prosecution today brought out
the" first evidence tending to ahow
Teiper's financial status. John H.
Black, head of a brick products dis
tributing company which - controlled
the plant that Teiper operated under -a
leasing arrangement, testified that
about the middle of January, - two
weeks before the murder, Teiper spoke
to him about buying the plant. Black
told Teiper that unless he was pre
pared to finance the undertaking .all
the way through the aale could" not
be made. He told Teiper that the
company was contemplating selling
the plant to some one else.
On the day before the tragedy. Black
swore, Teiper told him that If tha
plant had not been sold, he wanted to
renew his lease. - Black . told Teiper
tftat the plant had not been- sold but
did not say whether or not the lease
had been renewed. At htat time,
Black testified, Teiper owed Blade's -company
something less than $1,000 in
payment on his lease. Brick taken
from the plant after Teiper's arrest
cancelled this debt, the witness said.
