FEDERATION CONVENTION IS
AGAINST SCHOOL MILITARISM
BALTIMORE, Nov. 25.—After hot debate the American Fed­
eration of Labor adopted a resolution against teaching of military
training in public schools.
Secretary Baker's action in offering to place military instru
tors at the disposal of schools desiring them was condemned as tend­
ing to ''militarize" the schools.
Efforts of federation officers to prevent the action were swept
aside by an overwhelming vote after various milder substitutes had
been defeated.
Some of the warmest arguments for the resolution came from
Sarah Shapiro, representing the garment workers, a young woman
so tiny she was asked to speak from the chairman's platform that
she might be seen. The recent big fights of labor, that in Colorado
particularly, she declared, proved labor could have nothing in com­
mon with militarism.
"The children of the master classes arfe now taught the use of
guns and you can't stop it," said Furuseth. "I suppose you radical
Socialists would prevent the children of the proletarist from having
an equal opportunity. In the west every boy knows how to use a
gun. In the east you expect somebody else to defend you."
Would Organize Japs.
Organization of Japanese workmen
in their own counryt to get letter
wage and general living conditions Is
the solution of the "yellow peril"
tavox-ed bf the federation. Andrew
Furuseth, head of the seamen's union,
said.
"We are not going to permit admis­
sion of Japanese or other Orientals
into the federation," Furhseth said.
"It would be a wedge for entrance WORCESTER, Mass., rsov.
into this country of thousands of Ori- forts to organize the corset workers
entals as laborers."
It is planned instead, Furuseth said,
to organize the Japanese in their own
country.
B. Suzaki, Japanese labor leader
^attending the convention, in an ad­
dress, suggested sending Samuel
Gompers to Japan to organize the
workers.
Teachers Ask Protection.
An appeal for protection of teach­
ers, prompted by the dismissal of 38
Chicago teachers, was made to the
federation by Miss Ida Fursman, Chi­
cago, representing the American Fed­
eration of Teachers.
The teachers' federation presented
a resolution calling on the A. F. of L.
to watch the "vicious, country-wide
attempt to abridge the freedom of the
teacher, freedom of speech, of organ­
ization and of citizenship."
T. N. Cathrall, Pittsburgh, (Pa.)
Central Labor union, introduced reso­
lutions condemning the plans of Sec­
retary of War T'aker for formation of
military bodies in public schools. They
termed the move as one "toward mili­
tarism."
War Prevention Suggested.
The establishment and mainten­
ance by the federation, in conjunction
with other labor bodies of other
countries, of an international con­
gress of labor for hearing an,v discus­
sion of causes of disagreement be­
tween nations, is provided for in a
resoltion introduced by H. M. Mc
Larin, Federal Employes* union.
It is designed the deliberations of
this congress shall lead to evecution
of such politicial action by the work­
ers as will bring to attention of gov­
ernmental representatives of such na­
tions "the expediency of settlement
"by diplomatic means."

this attempt of workers to shield
themselves from wintry blasts. They
say plaster dries better in this kind of

MARION, 111., Nov. 29.—A coal
famine exists here, although this city
is in the heart of a coal producing
district with mines so near that coal
can be hauled here by teams.
In an attempt to get relief from
the shortage of supply and from ex­
orbitant prices, this appeal has been
sent out by the Marion Trades coun­
cil to other labor organizations:
"Do you realize that Marion, a city
in the heart of the southern Illinois
coal fields, ist in the midst of a coal
famine? With winter coming on we|
can see no improvement in the nearj
future without assistance from your.
honorable body. Regardless of the
fact that the cost of producing coal
has not advanced more than S to
5 cents per ton and the mines are
not producing more than ,50 per cent
of their output, the miners receiving
about 'half turn,* the consumer finds
it almost impossible to -secure coal
to keep his home warm and when he
is-a'ble to secure it he must pay $5.50
per ton when the usual price for coal
ranges from $1.75 to $2.25 per ton.
Blame It On Cars.
"When we asked relief from the
coal dealer and mine operator they
say: 'We can't get the cars.' The
railroads say: 'We can't furnish the
cars, but we are doing the best we
can, and if the shipper- would do
'thus and so,' we could give relief
some time in the future.'
"We believe these pleas do not ap­
ply to this city, from the fact that
there is no need for us to depend on
coal cars for our supply. The only
deep mine that formerly furnished
coal to wagons has discontinued this
and other mi-es refuse to fill wagons.
By this arrangement they can boost
the price of coal and pass the cause
of the coal famine to the railroads
who, in turn, pass it to 'he shippers."

PARIS, Nov. 29.—A cry of "Down
with war!" was heard in the chamber
of deputies during debate on a bill to
take a census of the 1918 conscripts.
The cry was raised by Deputy Pierre
Brizon, a Socialist, who was deprived
of the privilege of the floor for his
"intemperate language."
Premier Briand was forced to inter­
vene in the fiebate when some speak­
ers sugg-sted that France's allies
should be called upon to make a fur­
ther effort to supply men, as France
had already done her share and so
had brrne the heaviest burfen of the
war.
The bill was carried by a vote of 450
to
38.

CHICAGO, Nov. 29.—-Plans to seize
food and necessities held in gigantic
corners by commission men and brok­
ers and distribute them to the public
through stations established in all
parts of the larger, cities, were ad­
vocated here Tuesday by J. Hamilton
Lewis, Illinois Democratic party whip
in the senate.
Lewis outlined his plan in a letter
to United States District Attorney
Cline. Lewis' plan caused a stir
among brokers.
"The plan I shall propose in con­
gress when it meets in December,"
he said, "is for the government to
take possession of necessities and of­
fer a jut price for them. If declined,
condemn the products as a necessity
for the people, as we do land for
railroads and property for govern­
ment uses. Then submit to Juries
the evidence on all sides and let them
decide the just price.
"Let the government establish sta­
tions in each city, under charge of
the municipality or state, from 'which
the public may buy limit the amount
to be sold individuals, and see that
it is purchased ofily by those who
should be the object of governmental
protection."
Lewis said he was opposed to the
embargo on grain and that the ad­
ministration would not recommend it.
He said it. would bring retaliatory
measures yrhich would cause serious
financial and. business disturbances In

MADISON, Wis., Nov. 29.—The
state supreme court has reversed itself
in the case of the state versus the
Lange Canning company and now
rules that the state industrial commis­
sion may determine what classes of
labor are dangerous or prejudicial to
the health, safety and welfare of
women and how long they may be en­
gaged in a specific occupation without
detrimental con equences.
The .court held a contrary opinion
last May when it ruled that that por­
tion of the law was unconstitutional
because it was a legislative function
and the state legislature has no right
to delegate its power to a commis­
sion.
The state asked the court to review
the case, and this petition was sup­
ported by the state federation of labor.
In its later decision the court with­
drew its former ruling, but declined
to mark the boundaries of the
mission's authority on the ground' tiiat
..each order must be judged by itself.
The court says that "the law should
be upheld for the reason that the au­
thority thus conferred invests the
commission with no arbitrary and un­
controlled discretion, but directs them
to ascertain the facts and to apply the
rules of law thereto under the pre­
scribed rules and conditions. Such
action is not legislative, but has the
prominence of executive and minis­
terial party within the requirements
provided in the act.
