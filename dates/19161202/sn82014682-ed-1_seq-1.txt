Department of Public Works
Makes Sketches for Struc-
ure in Capitol Yard .
ketches and plans for a new terri
lal building estimated to cost
1150,000-and' built in modern . design
are. being drawn in the department of
public works under the direction oi
Superintendent Charles R. Forbes.
Forbes stated today that the plana
and sketches will be presented to uov
ernor Pinkham for his sanction before
enrnr to the legislature-
The proposed building will stand in
the 'capitol yard, on the site of the old
bungalow, which building will be torn
down to make way for the. new one.
According to the ; superintendent it
is ' the Intention to place In the new
structure all the territorial offices now
In the basement, turning their present
rooms into committee rooms for the
house and senate during future ses
sions of the legislature. -
This will take from the capitol the
department of public works and ' of
public lands. In addition the survey
office from the building in ' the ju
diciary tot will be Installed In the new
structure. It is also understood that
nw places for the tax office and the
bureau of conveyances would meet
with favor, if brought nearer the
capitol, though Forbes said he had not
considered those so far. :
"The building as I have planned it
will be a three-story structure," says
the superinten lent, "and will be of
concrete, absolutely fireproof. In It
will be placed vaults for the different
offices so that their records end docu
ments may be kept intact. There
will be an elevator and the plans will
be on modern lines.
