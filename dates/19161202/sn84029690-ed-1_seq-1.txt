A Fair Day a Large Crowd Our Home
Team and Vittory.
The fast Hays High School team
added another victory to their string
by taking an exciting game from
the Dickinson County Highs, Turkey
Day, by a score of jJJ to 7. The
game was the fastest cleanest exhibi
tion of real foot-ball ever staged by J
high school teams, and the Chapman
boys were well satisfied.
Ilarahman, the little Chapman lull
back, played the star game for the
Dickinsonians, and Westbrook. Bunny
Gross, Hicks Gross, and Boosh Gross
were the stellar lights for Hays.
The game was called at 3:15, Hays
winning the toss, Chapman kicking to
Ed Grass who returned it 15 yards. Ben
Westbrook carried the ball for 15 yards
on a long end run, and by a series of
line plunges another 15 jTards were
aided. With a criss-cross play, Hicks
carried the ball thirty-five yards through
a broken field to a tcuch-dojvn, Boosh
-ticking goal, Hays kicked to Odle, an
the Cnapman team carries the bai.
down the field by a series of line
plunges, bat lost the bill on downs.
Hays returns the ball to within five
yards of the Chapman goal, but are
carried tack by fumbles. Returning a
kick, Chapman bucks down the field to
a goal, and kicking goal, ties the score.
Hays comes back strong, using open
plays advance steadily. In the third
quarter, by a series of passes, wide-end
runs and criss-crosses, Hay3 pushes to
within two yards of Chapman's goal
and Wilson carries the bail across "on a
tackle saving. Hays kicks again, forc
ing Chapman to boot to get out of
dangerous territory. Hays rushes down
the field, uncorking play after play, be
wildering the heavy Dickinsonians.
Within the shadow of the goals, a series
of line plunges carries the ball across
for the final touchdown, Haj'S failing
to kick goal. Final score, 27-7.
Although th Chapman team were by
far the heavier .f the two teams, and
some of the bav.ks wcre fast, the local
toys showed the effect of coaching over
mere weight and speed. If the team
goes into the game Tuesday, with as
much punch and speed, there is no
doubt as to the outcome of the score
with theTast Luray team. But that
is dope.
