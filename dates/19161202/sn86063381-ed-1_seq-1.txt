DEVELOPERS TO
HOLD MEETINGTO
DISCUSS WASTE
LANDS IN STATE
Representative Warner to Call Meet
ing to Be Held at Brainerd in
January.
DRAINAGE IN NORTHERN
MINNESOTA ALL WRONG
.All Minnesota Development Urge the
Appointment of Committee
to Act.
Plans are being made to hold a
meeting at Brainerd of delegates from
all political and business organiza
tions in Beltrami, Aitkin, Crow
Wing, Cass and Itasca counties to
discuss the waste lands! in Minnesota.
Drainage plans will be discussed and
resolutions to be presented to the
state legislature will be passed. The
meeting will be held during the early
part of January. It will be called
by Representative C. H. Warner of
Aitkin who is a candidate for speaker
of the houste of representatives.
The All-Minnesota Development as
sociation has taken up the reclama
tion of waste lands in Minnesota. A
committee of which A. L. Crocker of
Minneapolis is chairman, has inves
tigated the waste land situation in
Minnesota and has sent out a cir
cular letter which in part follows:
"Minnesota is in a rut. She needs
some constructive visionJames J.
Hill was called a dreamer, County
Bismarck was called the man of to
morrow. Both had vast practical
executive ability. Both had con
structive vision They planned
things, then worked out their plans.
In natural resources Minnesota
equals New York and New England,
in agricultural resources she prac
tically equals New York and Penn
sylvania. Yet half the state is un
used. Dean A. F. Woods says there
is not an acre but what has a profit
able use. He says the annual prod
ucts of our farms and live stock
amounts to $550,000,000 and that
if the reclamation now being con
sidered is carried out it will double
that figure, and if other improve
ments that naturally accompany such
reclamation follows, another third
will be gained. Note, $550,000,000
today$1,100,000,000 $1,650,000-
000 possible. What would that
mean to every forward looking busi
ness man of this state? These
facts should be known by every cit
izen of the statenot by the legis
lature alone. Many business men
say it is the biggest thing betora
Minnesota today.
"Governor Eberhart, three years
ago, made a start on this work, ask
ing Mr. Crocker to study it He did
so and among several states engaged
in conversation, found New York tar
in the lead He asked for the master
mind in their work and was told that
it was Mortimer G. Barnes In one
part alone Mr Barnes had charge in
spending $150,000,000. He is a
Wisconsin farm boy and today owns
a 3,000-acre farm in northeastern
Nebraska. For 14 years he was in
the United States river and harbor
work all over the United States. He
reclaimed great swamps in Missouri
and is now consulting engineer for
the state of Massachusetts in dock
work in Boston harbor and is in
similar work in many other places
As a prominent consulting engineer,
he was invited to Minnesota to ad
vise Governor Eberhart and associ
ates* The work thus begun was
dropped with the exit of the gover
nor from office. It was revived last
spring when the All-Minnesota De
velopment association met at the state
capitol at which time the drainage
committee was appointed. It was
charged with the study of floods,
drainage and state reclamation. It
has sought all possible information
that might throw light on our state
problems!, has consulted many experts
within and without the state. It has
arrived at a fixed conclusion as to the
facts and remedies needed. The com
mittees had been told that the farm
population is decreasing that many
.homesteaders are quitting that
,homeseekers are passing by to other
localities that vast stums of money
have been thrown away in ineffective
drainage in this state.
"Such high authorities as Engineer
Stoner and Judge James H.
Quinn, recently elected to the su
preme bench, says that much of
Northern Minnesota drainage is
wrong. All over the northern part
of the state are ditches, but as the
head of the Duluth Tribune says, the
stettlers do not come. The
committee has come to belieye that
order must be brought out of chaos
in the management of the lands, for
ests, roads, waters, fisheries, etc., and
that a strong systematized business
body should be created, with a head
and expert!-* in the different depart
ments.
"The committee believes that in
no other way can order and effective
reclamation come to Minnesota.
Consulting Engineer Barnes
says we arejjot broad enough that
we face costly litigation if we delay
this organization. The legis
lature should act this winter."
John Gorman of Duluth is in the
city visiting his sister, Mrs. -P. E.
Waller.

60,000,000 FEET OF
TIMBER TO BE SOLD
The state timber board will meet
Saturday at the state capitol in St.
Paul to make arrangements for sales
next January of approximately 60,-
000,000 feet of timber These sales
will be made by the county auditors
in Cook, Koochiching, Beltrami, Lake
and St. Louis counties.
Last year approximately 15,000,-
000 feet were placed on the market
by the state auditor but there is con
siderably more timber available this
year. Members of the board express
ed the opinion that considerably
more will be received by the state
this year because there is a big de
mand for pulpwood which is now
bringing a bigger price than for
merly.

FEDERAL GOOD
ROADS EXPERT
TO ADDRESS N.
M. D. A. MEETING
Part That Federal Government Has
Assumed in Development of Roads
Will Be Explained.
ENGINEER OF PUBLIC
ROADS TO SPEAK
Will Set Out the Standards of Road
Building Under Federal 4
Aid.
The part the federal government
has assumed in the development of
good roads in the United States will
be explained to the Northern Minne
sota Development association at its
meeting in this city Dec. 7 and 8 by
E. O. Hathaway of the office of pub
lic roads at Washington.
P. St. John Wilson, assistant di
rector of the office of public roads,
with whom the officers of the devel
opment association have been in
communication, has definitely an
nounced that Mr. Hathaway, who
will be engineer in charge of the fed
eral district in which Minnesota isi
included, will attend the meeting at
Bemidji.
The relation of the Shackleford
Bankhead bill appropriating federal
funds for aid in building highways
as to road development in Minnesota
is a matter of great current interest.
Mr. Hathaway is expected to go into
that subject and also to set out the
standards of road building which are
to be required of states seeking fed
eral aid.
The interest being taken in the
coming meeting of the development
association indicates an unusually
large attendance. The definite an
nouncement that Amendment No. 1
has carried means that the discussion
of legislation to be framed under the
amendment will be one of the import
ant subjects before the meeting. Sena
tor R. C. Dunn of Princeton, and
Senator J. H. Baldwin of Frazee are
on the program for addresses on the
good road question, and other speak
ers will be John Owens of Cookv^yt
F. Jamar, Jr., of Duluth and Richard
R. Price of the University of Min
nesota.
The potato exhibit to be held in
connection with the meeting will
draw exhibits from all parts* of
Northern Minnesota and will be of
great interest to those who attend
the meeting.

quarterback '14, developed into a
strong Scoring and defensive team
and showed more football knowledge
than any team that has represented
the Bemidji high school.

"IS ANY GIRL SATE?"
FILM OF THRILLS
ALL SHOULD SEE
By F. A. WILSON
(Former Bemidji Editor)
"Is Any Girl Safe?" in Bemidji.
That interesting question will not
be answered at the Grand.
But
After you have seen this film you
are apt to find yourself asking your
self:
"Is ANY Girl Safe?"
Some idea of the intense dramatic
crisis attained is gained from the
fact that this picture was* seen by
more persons in Minneapolis (more
than 18,600 saw it during the first
eight days of its run at the Shubert)
than ever has gazed upon a five-reel
film in that city. The picture has
had three downtown runs in Minne
apolis and has played a total of 16
theaters in that city.
In bringing this film to Bemidji,
we do so with the knowledge that it
is proving to be the greatest five-reel
smccess of the season and with the
sincere belief that in writing the
scenario, Hal Reid has produced a
screen sermon that must stand as an
eternal warning a sermon to make
brothers shudder for the safety of
their sisters, fathers to fear for their
daughtes and mothers to awaken, as1
they never have been awakened be
fore.
When Mayor Wallace G. Nye was
called upon to prevent the showing
of this picture, he promptly called the
censor board together and had the
picture run off in his exhibition room
in the city hall, with the result that
the film was officially endorsed and
the film opened its Shubert engage
ment without any delay. In Duluth,
the film was publicly endorsed by
Mayor Prince and Commissioners
Fred Voss and Silberptein. The same
sort of voluntary endorsement has
been received wherever the film has
been shown St. Paul, Red Wing,
Mankato, Hibbing, Virginia, Cloquet,
Willmar and other Minnesota cities,
to say nothing of the New York city
endorsements, or in Milwaukee where
a municipal board of censors acts on
all pictures and in which city, "Js
Any Girl Safe?" broke the attend
ance record at the big Vaudette
theater.
If there is anything I say to the
readers of the Pioneer regarding this
film it is this:
The film handles a delicate subject
in a frank, modest way and must not
be confused with cheap, coarse so
called "white slave" trash it repro
duces the best thought of sJuch men
as Rev. Dr. Parkhurst the New York
district attorney who assisted in pre
paring the picture and the chiet of
police of the same city, who also
gave valuable assistance and who
loaned police apparatus seen in the
action of the film.
It is a film of thrills and one
which we believe every adult ought
to see.
F. A. Wilson of Minneapolis, for
merly publisher of the Bemidji Sen
tinel, now connected with the Amer
ican Mail Film company, which will
show "W Any Girl Safe?" at the
Grand theater Monday and Tuesday,
is a visitor in Bemidji today.
