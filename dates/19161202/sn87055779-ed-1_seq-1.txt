Amount Raised During First
Five Days 810,097.33.
Many Fail to Report.
With more solicitors in the field
than any day yet, the directors of
the Good Will week campaign are
putting forth every effort to make
Saturday the banner day for collec
tions. Several stores ttnd factories
have not heen heard from and are
expected to add considerable to the
sum for the week. The canvass will
he continued seven more days.
One of the solicitors tells of a
visit to a home where there were
two children, one of . w hom was at
tired only in an old shirt, w hile the i
other, a girl, was forced to wrap a '
quilt around herself for want of I
other clothing. This case lias been j
turned over to the Associated Chari
ties. Only $1,."07.1I was realized as a
result of the day's work Friday,
bringing the total for the six days j
of the campaign up to $10,097.:Jo
nnd leaving $r,l,602.(bS yet to be
laised if the original amount set is
to he 'secured.
There have been more than a
hundred solicitors in the field at
various times during the campaign
and only between 20 and oU have
reported each day. When al! the
workers have reported and when
the people who have been out of
the city or who could not he reach
ed have heen met and the several
hundred others whom there has
been no opportunity to see have
contributed, it is thought that the
amount already raised will be ma
terially increased if not doubled.
Reports from several of the thea
ters which have run benefit per
formances and from the children
who have heen selling hooks of
t:ckets to the Lasalle which are yet
to he received,-will materially help
to swell the total amount raised
during the week.

STRIKE PRIME!
BEFORE CONGRESS
WASHINGTON. Dee. 2. Anti
strike legislation designed to meet
the present crisis in the railroad
situation, will be the first care of
congress after it convenes next
Monday, house leaders declared
here today. The legislation will
probably contain a flat prohibition
against all strikes involving inter
state commerce or the movement of
the mails, and ;ill be framed by
the house interstate and foreign
commerce committee, under Pep.
Adamson of Georgia, author of the
eight-hour day law. House leaders
here preparing for the opening of
the session Monday have already
agreed upon early action on this
proposal, no matter what other
railway legislation is proposed.
Ke-p. Adamson's committee will at
once take up the railroad q':ewtjnn.
One of the house lndrs declared
today the railroad situation had
demonstrated that the country can
not longer be left opose--j to the
danger of a nation-wide calamity
through a railroad strike. The rail
roads, he said, were a public insti
tution, and must b administered in
the interests of the p-ihlie.
