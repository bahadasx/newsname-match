NEW YORK, Dec. 1. Tfie aban
donment by J. P. Morgan and Com-
'pany of the proposed sale of a
limited amount of short term
British .and French treasury bills
at the request of the entente allied
governments, announced here to
day, came as a surprise to the
financial community. ' The an
nouncement, issued from the Mor
gan offices, stated that the action
of the British and French govern
ments was taken out of regard
for the attitude adopted against
the sale by the federal reserve
board. .
- Trie surprise was heightened by
the fact that all arrangements for
the offering had been perfected.
-Dump U. S. Securities.
Othf'r plans to finance the pressing
needs of the British and French gov
ernments already are under way, it is
understood, but they have not yet
reached a definite stage. A member of
the Morgan firm informally stated that
no other plan had been formula W, but
it was learned from reliable sources
that the denial had been made as a
matter of policy.
The plans under contemplation, it is
intimated, will involve a large amount
of "dollar credit" available to Great
Britain if not to her chief ally. British
institutions and private investors still
retain large amounts of American se
curities although they have been large
ly mobilized by the British treasury.
War Orders Hold.
There have been no cancellations of
orders for war supplies or any other
materials to the countries of the
entente allies, according to the bank
ers acting for these interests and no
diminution of orders is expected.
Calls Canadian Gold.
The British ( government continues
to hold large reserves of gold in Can
ada and the more remote colonies,
and these reserves, it is believed, will
be employed to meet immediate ex
igencies, including stabilization of ex
change.

NOTES NOT POPULAR
IN ENGLAND, BELIEF
That, Many Think, Is the Real
Reason for Allied Action
Washington Reaffirms That
Warning Not Unfriendly.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. Withdraw
al of the British and French treasury
bills by J. P. Morgan and Company
with the statement that it was done
at the direction of the respective gov
ernments and out of a "desire to show
every regard to the federal reserve
board," created much interest in gov
ernment circles, but drew no official
comment further than a reiteration at
the state department that the reserve
toard's action was merely a matter
of domestic concern.
Warning Friendly
Secretary Lansing consulted eeveral
times with the board before the Issu
ance of its resent warning to Ameri
can bankers to avoid locking up their
funds in foreign treasury bills likely
to involve long term obligations and
advised the members that their action
could not be considered in the slight
est degree unneutral or unfriendly.
Nevertheless, as it affected foreign
securities, great care was taken to
point out in the board's statement
that the reasons were purely domes
tic and the warning was not intend
ed as a reflection on the financial
standing of any country.
Notes Not Popular
In some quarters today it was sug
gested that perhaps the allied gov
ernments' action was influenced to
some extent at least, by hostility in
their own countries to the short term
notes, on the ground that they put
their treasuries at the mercy of Am
erican bankers who could renew or
not, as they saw tit.
It was stated officially that no gov
ernment had approached the state de
partment in any way concerning the
notes, either before or after the re
serve board's announcement.
TEXAS MAJOR CHARGED
WITH POSTAL FRAUD
FORT WORTH. Tex., Dec. 1. Maj-
;or D. O. Elliott of the Fourth Infantry.
formerly superintendent of the money
order department of Fort Worth post
office, was arrested today at Marfa on
& federal indictment charging embez
zlement of postoffice funds, according
to information received here. He will
be returned to this city immediately
for trial. The indictment charges
that Major Elliott made false entries
in the post office books and the em-
jbezzlement of the J3.120.3S.
EASTERN BOX CARS ORDERED
WEST TO MEET CRYING HEEDS
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Dec, 1. To afford
quick relief to the railroads which
are suffering much from a car short
age, the American Railway Associa
tion today undertook to force a large
number of box cars from other sec
tions of the country to the south and
west. Announcement was made here
that instructions had been issued to
virtually all railroada by the confer
ence committee on car efficiency of
the association directing them to turn
over to their southern and western
connections more box cars than were
received In return. This applies both
to loaded and empty cars.
Railroads of the trunk line and cen
tral freieht territory and cenfral west
were instructed to send west and
south 20 percent more cars than they
receive In return. Southern and west
BUCHAREST DOOMED;
GOVERNMENT MOVES. i
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1. A
message from American Minister
Vopicka, at Bucharest, reaching
the state department today, re-
ported the removal of the Ruman-
ian central government from
Bucharest to Jassy, and said the
allied diplomatic representatives
also had left after placing their
interests in the hands of the
American legation. The minister
said Rumanian officials had little
hope that the capital tOuld be
saved from capture.
In addition to American inter-
ests and those of the allied pow-
ers now entrusted to him, Min-
ister Vopicka ' still represents
Turkey and Germany.
A report on the expulsion of
the Teutonic diplomatic repre-
sentatives from Greece by the
allies reached the department to-
day fi'om American Ambassador
Droppers, at Athens, who said he
had taken over the interests there
of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and
Turkey.

Desperately the Rumanians, prob-
jably aided by Russian troops, are de-

proaches to Bucharest, while the Teu
tonic advance continues to press more
closely on the Rumanian capital from
the northwest. Unofficially it is re
ported in London that Russian troops
have arrived in Bucharest to aid the
hard-pressed Rumanian forces.
Still Advancing.
Progress for the advancing German
and Austro-Hungarian armies in Wal
lachia and south of Bucharest is re
ported by Berlin, which says the Ru
manians continue to offer resistance.
The Rumanians apparently are on or
near the line of the Argeshu, as Petro
grad says the invaders have occupied
two towns south of Bucharest and near
that river. Field Marshal von Macken
sen, has thrown an army across the
Niaslov lowlands, which would be ap

The Russians continue aggreeively

em roads were required to give to
their southern and western connec
tions 10 percent more cars than they
receive.
Western railroads were directed by
the commission to discourage sending
to the Atlantic seaboard and New
England freight which apparently can
not be unloaded and disposed of on
its arrival.
All railroads were directed to send
to the conference committee on car
efficiency at Washington weekly re
ports showing the number of crs re
ceived or delivered to other roads,
so as to indicate the direction in
which the cars were moving.
In announcing this action the com
mittee stated that it was expected to
"force a large number of box cars to
the west, northwest, south and south

them."

Villa Loots
Chihuahua and Cries
"Death to Foreigners99
(By Review Leased Wire)
JUAREZ, Dec. 1 Villa bandits
were reported to be loading two
trains with loot from the stores
and private residences of Chihua
hua City and were preparing to
follow these trains west on the
Mexico Northwestern Railroad,
according to a message received
at military headquarters here to
night from General Ozuna's
scouts at . Sauz.
Defactos Delayed
General Ozuna's cavalry column
was at Cuilty, the first station north
of the state capital, the report said.
The scouts obtained their information
from refugees reaching Cuilty and
Sauz from Chihuahua City. This
news was taken at headquarters to in
dicate the intention of Villa to evacu
ate the city after looting it, as he did
at Parral, Santa Rosalia and Jimlnez.
General Trevino was said by General
Gonzales to have been in Horcasitas
yesterday awaiting the arrival of Gen
eral Francisco Murguia's forces from
the direction of Cania'rgo, south of
Chihuahua City.
Death to Foreigners
Villa made a speech against
foreigners in Hidalgo Plaza, fol
I' twing his occupation of the city,
a Chinese farmer and merchant,
who left Chihuahua City Wednes
day morning l 10 a. m., said upon
his arrival here early today on a
troop train. In his speech Villa
warned all residents of the city
against hiding anv, foreigners in
their homes and declared he in
tended to kill all foreigners, the
Chinese added. Villa also said
he intended to confiscate all for
eign property and give it t , '.he
Mexicans.
The Chinese explained that he did
Cut Out Oratory and Speed
Up Business of Congress Is
Advice of Speaker Clark
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. Speaker
Clark said today that if Congress
wanted to clear the legislative slate
and go home next March, he gladly
would join in a movement to eliminate
useless oratory by cutting down gal
lery space and abolishing the con
gressionel record and to introduce vot
ing machines.
It is not difficult to see the galleries
and the record causes an awful waste
of time and mOney," the speaker de
clared today as he paused in his ef
forts to outline a plan whereby
"serious work can be done in 63 legis
lative days. Any time that the gal
leries are full the orators 'on the floor
are posing and wasting time. And
everybody knows there are any num
ber of congressmen who talk for the
record a great deal more than is neces
sary. "The record is not necessary. The
English house o commons has none.

Germans Also Are Ready

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1. Following
the receipt today of a communication
from the German government admitt
ing that a German submarine torpe
doed the British horse ship Marina
with the loss of six Americans, Secre
tary Lansing conferred with Presi
dent Wilson and it was decided that
no action would be taken by the Am
erican government until it could be
definitely established whether the
Marina was a private vessel or a bel
ligerent transport.
In the note Germany stated that the
commander of the submarine which
sank the Marina had reported that
he took the vessel for a transport and

atout it by a Mexican woman in
whose house he was hiding at the
time Villa occupied the city. She re
turned to tell him she could no longer
shelter him as she was afraid of Vil
la's wrath if he discovered she was
hiding a foreigner.
Raid Terrazas Home
Before he could leave the house, a
detachment of Villa's men came in.
the Chinese said. They broke down
the door and started a search for him
when he' ran out of a back door and
escaped to Nombre de Dios, a suburb
an settlement near Chihuahua City.
He said he saw Villa troops at the
country home of General Luis Terra
zas, north of Chihuahua and these
fired at the train which. was leaving
lor the north, but without casualties.
He also said three trains of troops
esraped to Sauz Tuesday and Wednes
day but all went back with General
Ozuna, the Chinese said. He did not
see any American, French. German
or British refugees at Sauz, he said,
but only saw numbers of Chinese and
a few Syrians.
Many Chinese Slain

Chinese residents of Chihuahua City.
He said- he saw at least fifteen dead
In the streets near the house where
he was hiding and he believed many
others were kille'd. He said the can
non on Cerro Santa Rosa set fire to
many houses In the city.
5C0 Refugees in Rags ;
This Chinese citizen arrived here
In rags, although he was a prosperous
merchant and farmer at Chihuahua
City. He was without money as are
more than 500 here now and an appeal
has been sent to the Chinese ambass
ador at Washington for funds to feed
these refugees.
A journal is kept Dr. Johnson used
to write it after the day's proceedings
were over. He simply retarded who
spoke and which side they were on.
"I haven't much hope, though, that
I would receive much support if I start
ed to make a fight for smaller galleries
and no record, so I won't start it. But
there Is hope that the present method
of taking i'jII calls will be abolished.
It is archaic and a time-waster."
The speaker also favors reducing
the house from 435 to 300 members
and holding it to that number. Minor
ity Leader Mann today expressed the
view and offered figures to substanti
ate it that under no circumstances
could the Democrats have a majority
in the next house, but that there was
a chance for Republicans to have 218
members. He further said that he
was not worrying about the speaker
ship and thought it would be much
more fun to remain on his present job.

(By Review. Leased Wire.)
JUAREZ, Dec. 1. Juarez is a mili
tary garrison tonight. AH of the bar
racks are filled with soldiers and the
railroad yards crowded with troop
trains and parked artillery; the
streets swarm with Carranza soldiers
in the high crowned hats of the south
their bright colored blankets wrapp
ed to their ears. Officers ride every
where in automobiles and carriages
or walk along the main streets, their
words clanking. It was estimated
that there are 2,000 soldiers now in
Juarez, and a troop train from Casas
Grandes is expected to bring four hun
dred more tonight. Opposite the cus
toms house stands General Trevino's
private car 'Ebano,' which was saved
from falling into Villa's hauds by the
troops which fled north.
General Trevino's automobile was
also salvaged by his chauffeur and a
number of other automobiles were
brought to the border on the troop
train arriving early today.
Women and children who came
with the soldiers were begging in the
streets tonight and were carrying
away every pipce of wood, even the
discarded old ties lying along the
street car tracks, to burn in the camp
fires which dot the railroad yards, the
stock pens and the plains to the south.
There are 62 wounded in the Francis

Major Martinez, who came from Chi

headquarters are crowded with staff
officers from Chihuahua City.

VILLA CAUSES
military standpoint, possession Of
Juarez and Chihuahua might lead to
possession of Monterey, Saltillo and
Durango, and practical military con
trol of northeastern Mexico.
The most potent element with which
Villa has to reckon in any such move
ment is the American punitive expedi
tion in Mexico, spread out behind him
and fully equipped for any emergency.
Officials here -have not the slightest
fear of the ability of General Pershing
to protect himself against any force
that might be brought against him.
They are more interested in what
would be the attitude of the I'nited
States toward Villa in case he took
possession of the northern portion of
Chihuahua.
Those here well informed on Mex
ican affairs declare that the shortage
of ammunition among the Carranza de
fenders of Chihuahua City is entirely
an internal affair with the Carranza
government, and is in no wise charpe
