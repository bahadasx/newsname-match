The teaclit rs adopted a platform . u!!
ing for reform leKish.-ion. including
provision for a survey of the Virginia
public school system, more funds for
schools, an ad< uuate compulsory at
tendance law and the establishment of
a co-ordinate college for wniii.n at

Saunders is chairman of the legislative
committee. The association appro
priated $500 1 o be spent in securing
the passage of the desired laws. A
campaign for the stirring tip of interest i
in the program will 1.. begun next
May.
A resolution to investigate the teach
ers' pension system of the State was
referred to the legislative committee. ;
It was voted to appoint a committee,
to study the questions of teachers'
salaries in Virginia, with a view to
securing an increased appropriation
from both the State and the individual
counties.
Inspired by tiie action of the nurses
of Virginia in building a cottage for *
the sick of their profession at t'a
tawba. the State Teachers' Association
decided to begin at once n campaign
for funds for it similar cottage for
tcachers who have tuberculosis. The
proposed cottage will cost $.0,000. it
is hoped to have the fund raised by
the time of the next annual meeting.

The Conference of Division Supcrin- t

from the conference. The proposition
was made and discussed at a meeting j
of the superintendents held yesterday j
morning. "" ?
No friction wit It the other members i
of the conference nor thought that they

"What we want to meet separately ;
for." said President C. li. Howry, of'

feeling that sufficient, returns were not

and order is one big cloud on our

follow the world conflict," said former
President Taft Iti an address at the

"The highest tribunal in the hation

"It is a threat to starve the nation

ing may be the proper one. but the

the Council of Jewish Women and
others. It is also probable thai various
civic and labor organizations will be
requested to have representatives In
attendance.
Particular stress was laid last night
by ofliccrs of the league on the fact
that the action suggested will be taken
by the housewives of Richmond, who
arc the most vitally interested in the'
mallei, and that there should be a
large attendance at the meeting. It
will be impossible in the limited time
to extend written invitations to every!

At the meeting of the executive com
mittee yesterday afternoon reports of
the existing prices, which had been
gathered h> special committees yester
day who had visited all the markets
and numerous grocers of the city, were
made and compared with liie quota
tions that prevailed a few weeks ago.
There was great indignation at the
meeting over the advancing prices, and '
it was charged several times that the
advances had been out of all reason.

The hoarding of supplies in the cold-.
storage plants of the city was also;
brought up. and figures were produced
to show the great advances in the
priccs of commodities that had been
made since I lie 'supplies were placed in
storage. Apples that sold for ?
barrel when they were placed in the
?storage plants are now retailing for
$12. while flour was selling for $ I .SO.

This commodity is now, the committee j
reported. netting S12.
Practically every item purchased by
the householder was discussed, and
there was considerable indignation at
the advance of I cent per quart for
sweet milk, which was made by th.
local dairy companies yesterday. Sev
ern! members of the league were of
the opinion that the advance would
not benollt the farmers, and that it !
was done by the dairymen merely for '
greater profits. It is probable that the!
league will request' city officials to j
investigate this matter to determine i
whether or not the advance was Justi
fied.

! at the State Department during the

so as quickly as possible.
Officials indicated that no notion
? ?ould be e.xpectcd in the immediate
future on the Marina ease, admittedly

WITH 'I'll A VSPOUT SCItVICK
Germany, it is understood, is ready
to acknowledge err->r and make off<>rs
of settlement if it is ?stablished that
the Marina was not in the British
transport service. When the vessel was
sunk l.ondon dispatches s'yted that she
previously had been connected with
the transport service, and also that
she was armed with a gun astern,
manned by two British naval gunners.
If the ship was in public service
prior to being torpedoed, some State
P'purtment oltlciais lake the position
that the presumption was in fav? r of
the position that an enemy might have
believed her still to be a transport
when attacked. In order to clear up
this point, the nature of her previous
charter and the orders under which
she sailed will be investigated.
State Department orlieials hesitate to
make a ruling on what constitutes a
vessel tn public service in time of war
until a decision has been handed down
in tii'- case of the Italian steamer At
tualita, libeled In tit" Federal court at
Norfolk, Va.. after a collision with a
Greek vessel The point -*it issue is
somewhat similar to that involved in
the Marinn incident, as the character
of the Attualita is disputed.

Secretary l.ansing went over the case
in detail with President Wilson after
the call of the German ambassador, but
at the time had not examined alt the
aflidavits bearing on the attack on
file at the State Department. It was
indicated that it will he possible for
the American government to collect all
the evidence necessary without fur
ther reference to the German govern
ment.
In its last note to Germany on the
submarine question, the United States
stated that diplomatic relations would
be broken off unless the practice of
torpedoing vessels without warning
was abandoned.
The door to acceptanco of amends
was not entirely closed, although warn
ing was given that offers of repara

not compensate for illegal destruction
of American lives.

tonic advance continues to press more
closely on the Roumanian capital from
the northwest. L'noltlcially it Is re
ported in l.ondon that Russian troops
have arrived in Bukharest to aid the
Roumanians.
Progress for the advancing Germans

The Russians continue aggressively
their offensive against the Austro
German lines from the Carpathians to
i Southern Transylvania. Berlin states
j the Russian attacks, which are <le
: dared to have been along a front of
lSfi miles, from Jablonitza to Kcdzi
Vasarhely, resulted only in small ad
vantages. which arc declared not to
j he commensurate with the cost in men
and ammunition. Petrograd admits a
repulse southwest of Vakarka. in tho
Carpathians, but records the capture "of
a ridpe of heights south of Kirllbaba.
The fighting in Dohrudja has become
more intense. Bukharest announces a
violent attack along the whole front in
I that region. Berlin declares that the
attack against the Bulgarian left wing
in Dohrudja failed, and that British
"tanks" are being used by the at
tack crs. , .?_1
In Galicia there also has been a re
awakening of activity. Petrograd
records that an Austro-German at
tempt t\> take the offensive north of
the Tarnopol-Zlogzow Railway was re
puis'd.
In Macedonia, in Franco and on the
Austro-Italian front there lias been no
important change in th ? situation. The
artillery activity on tin Sommo front,
in Northern France, and in the Tren
tino and Parso regions of the Italian
theater, is reported to be increasing.
Both Berlin and Paris claim the re
pulse of attacks northwest of Mon
