WIFE BEATERS OF
DRY OLD KANSAS
A Kansas town la setting up a pil
lory for wifc-bcatcrs. Wh.t arc tho
ctatistico concerning wlfs-ueatlng In
Hi i Prohibition ctatea, anyhow?
Is there any conmctlon between
tho habit of not dt inking, and tho
I n'jlt cf wifc-bc.itlnrj? Wo know of
no c'.hcr statu In which wlfc-beatlng
Is co prevalent that resort must be
held to the pll'ory to discourage It.
lo prohibition v.oitli tho pr.ee If It
Ica'Js to wlfc-beatlng? And Just vhy
when the psychic stimulant Induced
by alcohol Is removed, should a man
turn to wifc-ocallng? Is there also
n psychic stimulation in vlfe-bcat-Ing?
Wc don't know anything about It,
we only Inquire. It sccmo to us to
ho one of those cases calling for a
thorough Investigation by pbchoto
gists, physical eclentists, sociolo
gical experts, and a book contain
ing two hundred tables and n thou
sand pages. Such n bcok Is n ter
rlbto thing to contemplate, but
something must bo done to save
Kansas. New York Sun.

Tl:e Houston Post editorially makes
fun of tho Colorado brand of prohibi
tion, najing:
Coloiado is a prohibition ctato. Pro
Biunably it is tho ono nnd only dyed
I .11 llic wool inoiuuiiiuii niuiu ui uitiu
I ill. Tor in Colorado, when tho antls
j found that prohibition :ia Boing to
catr.v in spito of ull their elforts they
decided to make tho prohibitory laws
ko stringent and to enforce them so
thoroughly that Colorado would bo
Inil to re enter tho wet column at tho
' nevt election.
Go Colorado has tho stringent laws.
Colorado lm tho thorough enforce
ment. Or at least Colorado pooplo
thought tho laws vcro enforced. May
bo thoy aro, but judge- for jourself.
In prohibition Denver tho mnjorlty
of liquor ahipmcuts aro to women.
They drho up to the freight depots in
drays nnd load In tho boor and whis
key cases by tho wholcfialo. Ono wom
an recched nix barrels of beer In this
manner and oho said oho was going
to dilnk it herself. Another woman
recelcd ton gallons of whiskey and
Rtlll another got nlnet-slx pints of
whlsl-oy. All of them must drink this
stuff thomsehco or violate tho law.
Tho freight people e3tlmato tho
amount of bc9r rccelcd In Denver at
100 barrels each day. Whiskey goes
thoro In quantities equally imposing.
Ono shipment of a solid carload of
liquors went lo I.eadvillo lnnt month
to bo usod by ono IndlUdual, and
neither to ho Bold or given away. Tho
law is strict on thoao points and tho
lav Is belli! enforced. So say the
people of Colorado.
Ono curious thing about those
liquors is thoy go to a dry stato, and
many of thorn go from a dry state,
Kansas Is dry. In fact it Is vory dry.
It la so dry that it la tho prido of
every prohibition orator In tho coun
try. Dut a good many of tho liquor
ohipmonts Into Colorado aro fiom Kan
sas. Thoro Is a good deal of food for re
flection In all this. Thoro Is much for
tho prohibitionists to explain. And
thon again, theso conditions in Colo
rado explain somo things. To a cor
tain extent thoy explain why, with a
larger per cont of toirltory dry than
In any other year, tho United States
used 10,000,000 gallons of whisky more
In 1915 than In any preceding year.
