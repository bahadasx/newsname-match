Mrs. Astor's Protege
Runs Away and Lands
in the Law's Clutches
New York, Dec. 2—William Nau
Jnann, aged 15, musical protege of
Mrs. Vincent Astor, was in court to
day wondering whether his love for
Adventure had ended the brilliant
prospects liis soprano voice had won
.for him.
Willie ran away about two months
ago from the choir school of the
Church of the Messiah in Rhinebeck,
where he had been for eight months.
Mrs. Astor was paying all expenses.
He will be taken care of when the
guardianship of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children has
been substituted legally for that of
his mother.
While waiting for court to open
Willie was put into the room of the
clerk, but he could not keep from
singing, always switching to the
chorus of "The Daughter of Mother
Machree."
While working as an errand boy at
$5 a week his voice attracted atten
tion and he became a pupil at a sing
ing school. When he ran away from
school he returned to New York city
and began selling papers.
KRUPP COMPANY MAKES
MORE THANJLAST YEAR
Report Shows Smaller Earnings, But
Increased Revenues Were Used to
Build New Plants.
Berlin, Deo. 1.—(Via London, Dec.
2.)—While the annual report of the
Krupp company shows apparently
smaller profits than for last year, it
is believed the company earned con
siderably more than In the preceding
year, but that the increased revenues
were devoted largely to building new
workshops required to fill orders.
The report states that the gross
profits for the year were 113,000,000
marks, which Is 15,000,000 marks be
low last year, but the writing off of
80,000,000 marks occurred before the
drawing of the balance sheet. This
amount and other deductions make a
total reduction of 85,000,000 marks,
as against 38,000,000 marks for the
same purposes last year. As the re
ductions increased 47,000,000 marks,
it Is believed the profits must have
increased at least 32,000,000 marks.
A dispatch from Berlin dated No
vember 80 said the Krupp company
had declared a dividend of 12 per
cent, the same amount as in 1815.
England to Have a
Research Department
London, Dec. 2.—The government
nks decided to establish a separate
department of scientific Industrial re
search, over which the Marquis of
Crewe, lord president of the council,
will preside. Subject to the consent
of parliament, a large sum will lib
placed at the disposal of the depart
ment for the conduct of researches
for the benefit of national industries.
New Coin, V/z Cent Piece,
Favored by Mint Director
Washington, Dec. 2.—A two and
one-half cent piece is demanded by
the country, according to ths director
of the mint whose annual report
recommends passage of a law author
ising coins of that denomination from
copper and nickel. "The economic
importance will be readily seeit," says
the director. "Popular shops, such as
the 6 and 10 cent stores, would un
doubtedly place articles now selling
two for 5 cents on sale at 2 1-2 cents."

Bismarck, N. D., Dee. 2.—Trusting
that Santa Claus may drop a pardon
into their Christmas stocking, scores
of prisoners in the Bismarck peni
tentiary today are telling the North
Dakota prison board why they should
be restored to liberty. The prisoners
appear through petitions and through
their "next friends." Of the latter,
there are dozens, state's attorneys,
sheriffs and others who were con
cerned In incarcerating the unfor
tunates and who are now interested
in getting them out again, feeling they
have had enough.
In addition to the prisoners, there
are scores of paroled convicts who
will ask full pardon as a Christmas
gift, and others, former convicts, who
will petition for the restoration of full
citizenship rights. The December ses
sion of the board always is a
one, but the grist of business for to
day sets a high record.

forces in an effort to retake the city
from Villa bandits, is expected to be
gin some time today, if not already

first information to reach the war de

the American border or to the safety
of Pershing's men. The reports were
based entirely on information obtain

reaching El Paso from Chihuahua
City.
Both agreed that the fighting in the
city had been desperate, with strategic
points captured by Villa forces and re
taken by de facto troops several times
from the beginning of the battle

London, Dec.. 2.—Rumor still

a more forceful conduct of the war.
The general impression is that a

sion of new blood, is contemplated,
but nothing definite is announced.
Premier Asquith conferred with the
king today, "but whether it had to do
with contemplated changes is prob

London, Dec. 2.—Cabinet changes
involving the resignation of Premier
Asquith, are predicted by the Man
chester Guardian in an article In to
day's issue on current rumors re
specting political changes.
Some of the other morning news
papers reflect popular dissatisfaction
with the government by reiterating
the criticism which has been made
continually of late. The Times calls
for a small, harmonious and resolute
body of ministers and sees no hope of
improvement as long as Asquith is
premier. It also wishes the removal
from the cabinet of Viscount Grey,
the Marquis of LansOown and Mr
Balfour.
