cial supreme court commission con­
sisting of Asociat6 Justices Christian

ley, Nuessle and Pollock. At press
time it had not been determined
whether the order would issue. If an

following their election.
Attorney General Linde freely vol­
unteered all information in his pos­
session. He is not, the attorney gen­
eral stated, acting for either faction
in the present controversy, but is tak­
ing step3 to insure North Dakota a
legally constituted court for the
month of December. Whether that
court shall haye as its membersjGrace,
Robinson and Birdzell or Pisk, Burke
and Goss remains for the- supreme
court to decide."

Jury in Trial This Afternoon
WITH THAT STATEMENT
SHE BURST INTO SOBS
Thompson Falls, Mont., Dec. 2—'He
called me red-light woman." This
was the reason given by Miss Edythe
Colby this afternoon to the jury why
she shot and killed Republican Coun­
ty Chairman Thomas last September
Then she burst into sobs.
Testimony that Miss Edith Colby, a
newspaper reporter on trial here for
murder for killing A. C. Thomas, a
prominent politician, last September,
attempted to have Thomias arrested
for insulting her, and further testi­
mony to establish that Mi^s Colby
was of unsound mind was introduced
by the defense today.
The testimony that Miss Colby had
sought Thomas' arrest was given by
William Strom, clerk of the court here
an dthe last witness of the day.
Nearly Fainted in Chair.
"Miss* Colby dropped into my office
before the shooting," Strom said, "and
nearly fainted in a chair. She want­
ed to see Wade Parks, the prbsecut
ing attorney, and told me that she had
many troubles."
The next morning, Strom said,
about half an hour before Miss Colby
shot Thomas, she called Prosecutor
Parks on the telephone. Strom an­
swered the1telephone and told her
that Parks ,was out of town. Strom
said that he had conversed with Parks
about the possibility that Miss Colby
was a detective.

A safety^ first plea will accompany

in 1916. .1#
"A Word of Caution to Mortorist3,"
is the title of a particularly timely
circular just issued by the Northern
Pacific bureau of efficiency. The
warning sinks liome, in view of a
series of disastrous automobile-train
collisions within the past six weeks.
The circular advises caution in ap­
proaching gradfe.crossings, and calls
attention to thlkfact that in 1914,
1,147 persons wese killed and 2,935 in­
jured at grade crossings. In 1915, 997
persons lost their lives and 2,898 were
injured. "The reduction in casuaUies
in 1915, as compared with the
...pre­
vious year, is due to warning notices
posted by railway companies and au­
tomobile clubs," says the Northern
Pacific.
"Trains have no choice of routes,"
reads the circular. "They must run
on the rails, and their patrons require
that they be on time if possible. Mo­
tor car drivers can choose their own
routes, and the occupants of machines
usually are not pressed for time."
Speed of tars or Trains
An interesting table showing the
speed ol' trains or cars moving from
five miles an hour to 100 miles, as
counted in seconds, is a feature of
the circular. It shows that a train
or car moving five miles an hour trav­
els 7.3 feetiiper second at 30 miles
an hour, 44 feet per second, and at 100
miles the hour, 150 feet per second.
Trains moving. 25 to 40 miles an
hour can under ordinary conditions
stop within 1,200 feet, while motor
cars running at the same speed can
be stopped in about thirty feet. .The
train often weighs as inuch aa 'S.OOO
tons, while the automobile's weight
rarely exceeds two tons.
To Enclose Circulars
North Dakota licChae tags are
wrapped and sealed at the factory.
F. M. Metcalfe, first vide president and
special representative of the. Northern

this will be dobe if arrangements can
be made with the manufacturer. If
not, they will be inserted here.

Carranza Forces Believe That
They Will Be Able To Trap
Bandit Chief
WASHINGTON CONSIDERS
AN EMBARGO ON ARMS
New Constitution Outlined to
Mexico's First Liberal
Congress,
'El Paso, Texas, Dec. 2.—The situa­
tion of the Carranza government in
northern 'Mexico is desperate, follow­
ing the capture of Chihuahua City toy
Villa.
"If he does." said (general Gonzales,
"we will be able to bring up from
three sides heavy forces and crush
the bandit army."
Indications are that Villa is prepar­
ing to move. All channels of escape
are reported cut off by Carranza
troops.
At Queretaro, Carranza outlined to
25^ffelegates to Mexico's first liberal
congress, the terms of Mexico's new
constitution. The proposed constitu­
tion adheres closely to the famous
Declaration of Juarez.
Villa bandits were reported loading
two trains with loot from the stores
and private residences of Chihuahua
City and preparing to follow these
trains west on the Mexican North­
western railroad, according to a mes­
sage received at military headquar­
ters tonight from General Ozuna's
scouts at Sauz.
General Ozuna's cavalry column
was at Cuilty, tje first station south
of the state capital, the report said.
The scouts obtained their information
from refugees reaching Cuilty and
Sauz from Chihuahua City.
This news was taken at headquar­
ters to indicate the intention of Villa
to evacuate the city afteV looting it,
as he did at Parral, Santa Rosalia and
Jimenez.-
General Trevino was said uy Gen­
eral Qpnzales to have been ih Hofca
sitas yesterday awaiting the arrival of
General
rF,rancisco
Murguia'B forces
from the direction of Camargo, south
of Chihuahua City.
Villa made a speech against for­
eigners in Hidalgo platfa, following his
occupation of the city, a Chinese far­
mer and merchant who left Chihua­
hua City Wednesday morning, s^id up­
on his arrival here today on a troop
train.
EMBARGO PLANNED.
Washington, Dec. 2.—An American
embargo on shipments of arms across
the iborder promises to be a live issue
between this government and Mexico.
Carranza's advisers are displeased at
the United States regulation. They
claim that the lack of ammipnition
cost them Chihuahua City. Ameri­
cans claim they had plenty of ammu­
nition, which Villa's men took away
from them. Ambassador Arred^ndo
called the attention of Secretary Lan­
sing to the situation. If assured that
ammunition is not going to fall into
the hands of Villa freer shipments
will be made.

COMPANIES BELIE 7E THEY
SHOULD HAVE PROTECTION
Volunteer firemen oi North Dakota
arc preparing to light an effort which
it is rumored will be made in the Fif­
teenth legislative assembly to divert
to the general fund of the state the
two per cent premium upon fire insur­
ance policies which heretofore has
gone to the support,0?.,the fire depart­
ments.
In 1915 there was-derived from this
source $27,162.11. which
whs
distrib­
uted affiong the organized lire depart­
ments in the territories originating
the business. In many.-lnstanees, this
fund is the sole support of small,
volunteer fire department:-.. Ordin­
arily these small departments are lo­
cated in "i'rabie" towns most liable
to losS^froni lire and least able to
contribute liberally to the support of
arl organized fire department. The
firemen contend that if this important
source of support,is cut off, numy of
these towns will be deprived entirely
of the protection of an organized de­
partment and will be left at the mercy
of the fiames.
Itifttons I/iving |niod
Those who l&vor aivolySliiR this
mium revenue to the general fund^of
the state argue that the money distri­
buted to the fire departments is used
up in riotous living. The firemen
strenuously deny this allegation, and
assert that in most instances these
funds are applied to the purchase of
equipment, and that in some cases it
has afforded the sole means of pro­
curing fire-fighting apparatus.
Ih Marmarth, for instances, a town
of about 500, not a penny of this pre­
mium fund has been touched for years.
Now that Marmarth has extended its
wator mains, the department expects
to apply the fund to the purchase of
a motor truck, placing Marmarth in
the same class with Fargo, Grand
Forks, Minot and Bismarck,.so far as
ability to combat fires in. a modern
manner is concerned.
The village of Sanborn has bought
every bit of its fire-fighting apparatus
it possesses through the medium of
this two per cent premium tax.
Insurance Companies Object
Fire insurance companies operating
in North Dakota object to the diver­
sion of the fund on the grounds that
they are paying this tax of two per
cent upon every premium written for
protection, a sort of insurance of their
own intended to make their chances

THAT EXPLAINS WHY JUDGE
AMIDON DELAYS SENTENCE
Federal Court Judge Announces
That Sentence Will Be Passed
on December 22
(Special to the Tribune.)
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 2.—That the hand
which once juggled the funds of\the
patrons might help in piloting' the
journey of the stork to safety and
grasp the hand of the mother -was
learned today as the reason for the
delay in Judge Charles F. Amidon of
the federal court here, in not passing
sentence on William F: Kittel, former
cashier of the First National bank at
Casselton, which failed just a year
ago.
Brother on Way to Leavenworth.
•While the stork was hovering over
the residence of W. F. Kittel in Cas­
selton, it probably passed in its flight
the train bearing the brother defend­
ant, Richard C. Kittel, who was sen­
tenced this week to serve seven and a
half years in' the federal prison at
Leavenworth.
In the little home which will soon
be fatherless this coming Christmas—
probably for the first time—a child
was born yesterday. The child is
that of William F. Kittel, who doubt­
lessly will be on- his way to the same
prison as his brother defendant be­
fore this glad Yuletide. Judge Charles
F. Amidon announced today that sen­
tence would be passed on December
22.
Explains Court's Delay.
This pathetic feature of the former
banker's case watt brought to light
this morning in explanation of the
court's delay in sentencing the young­
er brother. The people of Fargo and
the people of the northwest wondered
the r-eason why. In Casselton it was
whispered from mouth to mouth that
the stork was hovering near.
The little child may not know the
father for five or seven years. Just
how Mong she will be withojjt hpr
daddy" depends) upon the judge.
Hut the father will carry on his trip
a vivid picture of his child. It will
last until the banker i^ discharged or
until the little child is old enough to
visit the\prison.

Washington, Dec. 2.—Legislation to
pecmit exporters to combine to ob­
tain export trade is urgently recom­
mended by the Federal Trade commis­
sion in an exhaustive annual report
of the federal trade situation. The re­
port says this would greatly benefit
manufacturers. Investigation cover­
ing months carried on by! the aid of
United States consuls was world wide
in its scope. Other nations have
marked advantage in foreign trade
and superior facilities, owing to ef­
fective organizations.
Legal restrictions prevent Ameri­
cans from developing an equally ef­
fective organization for oversea busi­
ness. The trade of American manu­
facturers and producers suffer.

The secretary of the North Dakota

"Present indications are strong that
the disease is infectious stomatitis of
horses, which has extended to cattle,
and not foot and mouth disease. The

although local authorities have quar­
antined locally. The department prob­
ably will issue an announcement to­
morrow."
None in North Dakota.
"There has been no outbreak of the
epidemic in North Dakota to date,"

dle, but it yields to treatment, and is
not dangerous."
