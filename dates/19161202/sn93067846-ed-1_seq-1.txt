SAFE PASSAGE REFUSED.
BRITISH OFFICIALS WILL NOT

FOR COUNT TARXOW. |
Sny Conduct of Teutonic Ambassa?
dor* und Consuls Has Been Such as |
to Justify Them in Declining to]
Aid Movement of Such Diplomats.
London, Nov. 27?The foreign ofrj
fu has *ent Ambassador Page a noi?j
definitely refusing to grant a
conduct to Count Adam Tarnowslttj
von Tarnow, the new Austro-HuttjJ
garian ambassador to the Unlteqj
States.
The reason for the refusal may hlj]
paraphrased as follows:
"Evan if international law ?orbadl
the refusal of such a conduct the ac*jj
jtlon of Austrian and German ambasr]
?tea and consulates abroad has b
so much In excess of regular dipl
matlC functions that tho Britsh goi
crnment feels justified in withholdll
its consent for such diplomats to tra^l
el to their posts."
ACTION MAY BRING OOJfl
VERSY.
Washington Inclined to Relieve
other Dispute With Entente Is
the Making.
Washington, Nov. 27.?AnoW
controversy between the AmerM
government and the cntento al
may result from the refusal of
British government to grant
conduct to Count Tarnowski, na1
appointed Austro-Hungarian i.ml
sador to tho United States.
In the absence of official ad^
on the subject, officials of the
department would not discuss It
mally or attempt to forecast1
course the government Is llkel|fj
pursue. It was made evident, 1
ever, that the unfavorable actioj
the British foreign office on tho
tlce of tho intention of the new
bassador to cross the Atlantic
as an unpleasant surprise.
It had not been doubted hei
j^hatrlfrtmtn vmrHite tfi^laar:
to deny the privileged character ?l
a diplomatic officer on such * voyage.
Aside from the belief that England
would not desire to arouse adverse
feeling in the United States by inter?
ference with tho ancient and general?
ly unquestioned right of a neutral
government to receive an ambassador,
or minister, officials had counted upon
Groat Britain's record in the\ Mason
and Slldell case to prevent such an
action as reported in today's cable
1 dispatches.
The fact is recognized that In pro
! testing against tho removal of the
1 Confederate commissioners from the
steamship Trent the British govern?
ment was mainly concerned with the
violation of the protection afforded
by the British Hag under which the
Trent sailed and it is said that it was
on that account the United States re?
pudiated the action of its naval com?
mander. But It is held hero that
though secondary, the protest also
was based on the right of diplomatic
officers to make their way to their
posts in neutral countries without
molestation. It probably will be on
that basis that the matter of Count
Tarnowski's interrupted mission will
be taken up with the allies, for it is
well understood that the London
foreign office is supported by France,
Italy and Jtussia in its action.
It was learned today that the state
department so far has not made a for?
mal request for a safe conduct for the
Austrian ambassador but has conlined
itself to a transmission of the request
of the Austrian government for such
a courtesy. Therefore it is probable
that if the issue is to be made up it
Will be necessary for the United States
now to make such a request on its
own account.
There is an absence of any prece?
dent exactly Utting this case that re?
quires the department to be very
careful In assuming ground, and the
text of the note handed Ambassador
Page will be awaited before a decision
ag to the course to be followed is
, reached.

rowp. _ ?) I
The case is familiar In fr?uth Caro?
lina. On June 14, 19f5, Jn'i2S Smith,
charged with committing a criminal
assault upon the person of a white
woman of Fairtield county, was in
the custody of Sheriff A. D. Hood of
Fairfleld, Deputy Sheriff Raleigh
Boulware and a number of other
deputies. As the sheriff started up
the steps of the Fairfield county
court house where court was then in
session with Judge John S. Wilson
presiding it is alleged that a mob
fired upon tho sheriff and his depu?
ties killing Sheriff Hood, his deputy,
Raleigh Boulware, and the negro
prisoner, Jules Smith. Ernest Isen?
hower, Jesse Morrison and James T.
Rawls are charged with being the
leaders of the mob and the men who
flred tho shots. As the result of a
change of venue Ernest Isenhower
was tried here before Judge Hayne F.
Rice in December of last year,
charged with killing Raleigh Boul?
ware, the trial resulting in an ac?
quittal.
The first witness sworn this after?
noon was A. Lee Scruggs, treasurer
of Fairfield county. He said ho was
in the court house yard when Sheriff
Hood and his prisoner, Jules Smith,
who had just been brought from the
State penitentiary, alighted from
their automobile and started for the
court house. He described the fusil?
lade that took place when the sher?
iff's party started up the court house
steps. He said he recognized Kniest
"isenhower among the party tiring on
the sheriff.
W. W. Turner, the next witness,
testified that he was near the court
house when the sheriffs party en?
tered tho yard and said he w itnessed
the whole affair. Ho stated that he
saw Ernest Isenhower who was stand?
ing near the porch of the building
and saw him tire two or more shots
in the direction of Sheriff Hood. ii(
also saw Morrison lire at Sheriff
iHood but did not know Morrison at
that time.
j C. B. Taylor, a farmer, testified
that he saw Clyde Isenhower getont
his pistol and shoot the negro, Jules
Smith, whereupon Sheriff Hood drew
his pistol and said Hood and Clyde
Isenhower fired a4, each other prac?
tically simultaneously. He saw Er?
nest Isenhower in the group tiring at
tho sheriff and also recognized Mor?
rison In this party.
J. W, Hood testified that he gave
Rawls a pistol on the day of the
tragedy,
lt. W. Matthews testified that fare
ex; mined Rawls' pistol the day fol?
lowing the shooting ami that three
0h0mhers wt re empty.
Court adjourned for the day short?

that the trial will last three days.
I? MOVE g MjjSOI TEST.
TRANSCRIPT OF CASE REACHES
HIGH COURT.
Government Expected to Move for
Advance of Hearing in Supreme
Tribunal as Haste is Desired*
Washington, Nov. 21.?The tran?
script in the case of tho Missouri,
Oklahoma & Oulf railroad, chosen to
test the constitutionality of the Adam-!
son law, was received late today at
the supreme court. The department
; of justice was notitied for instructions
; as to whether the case would be im
! mediately docketed or temporarily
j withheld by the government. The
t transcript was sent direct to the clerk
' of the supreme court by registered
I mail by the clerk of the federal court
j at Kansas City in which Judge Hook
j decided that the Adamson act was
j unconstitutional. ,
Instead of immediately docketing j
! the case today, Clerk Manor sent
the transcript to Solicitor General
Davis by messenger. It is expected
that the department of justice within
a few days will formally file the tran?
script and have the case docketed.
Next Monday, when the court re?
convenes, a motion to advance the
case for early hearing probably will
bo presented by the department of
justice with concurrence of railroad
counsel.
Tho transcript comprises 74 type?
written pages and covers each step
in tho enactment of the law as weh
as the procedings in w hich the stat?
ute was declared by Judge Hook to
j be "unconstitutional, null and void,"
j included in the record is the appeal
allowed the government by Judge
* Hook upon a bond of $500, s gned by
; District Attorney Francis If, Wilson
of the western Missouri district, the
nominal defendant in the injunction
suit, and Frank Hagerman, special
counsel for the government.
The assignment of errors presented
by District Attorney Wilson is purely
formal, alleging that Judge Hook
orrcd:_ a. . m
"(I). In not sustaining the motion
to dismiss the bill.
"(2) In not entering a decree dis?
missing the bill.
"(.?.). In not upholding the validity
? ot the act of congress approved Sep
tembef 3, 191G, commonly known as
the Adamson act.
"(4). In enjoining the said defend
i
ant (District Attorney Wilson) as
prayed In the bill."
The decree signed by Judge Hook
November 22, includes instructions to
the railroads to keep special accounts
j of money due the trainmen after Jan?
uary 1 under the Adamson law, so
that if it should be upheld by the
supreme court prompt payment of
such accounts can be made.
The Missouri, Oklahoma ft Gull
railroad's bill covers the principal
points of attack upon the law made in
{the many other suits hied, asserting
that the statute is indefinite, uncer?
tain, unworkable, incapable of appli
' cation a mere temporary expedient
I and that it deprives the railroads of
liberty of contract and property with?
out the due process of law prescribed
1 in the federal constitution.

pany of coast artillery will return

Roads for Protection, v1
-/
Washington, Nov. 87.- . *mination
of A. P. Thom, counselor tue railway
executive advisory <^ tittee, on sug?
gestions he has m-Oj n behalf of the
railroads tor lejj>' tion to improve
their situatio* .is begun today by
the joint co* jsional committee in?
vestigating \. tnsportation problems.
Senator Newlands, chairman, and
Representative Adamson, vice chair?
man of the committee, conducted to?
day's examination and Mr. Thom will
resume the stand tomorrow to be
questioned by other members.
Mr. Thorn's testimony was directed
almost exclusively to developments of
iiis suggestion lor compulsory national
incorporation of railroads. He said he
believed congress has power-to com?
pel a carrier to obtain a federal licen.3e
or charter, or forbid it to interstate
commerce. Police powers over grade
crossings, separate passenger cars for
different races, taxation, and other
such questions, he thought, should
be left as far as possible to the State.
He opposed dividend limitations on
nationally incorporated roads unless
a minimum as well as a maximum
return is lixed.
Answering a suggestion of Mr.
Adamson that the railroads might try
out national incorporation on one new
road he said the question confront?
ing the public now is not how a
nationally incorporated roa.d would
succeed, but how to take cire of 250,
000 miles of road already in opera?
tion which need some such relief as
he believes will be found under a fed?
eral controlled system.
Mr. Thom said the railroads are
almost unanimously for federal in?
corporation and that although most
railroad men oppose government own-,
ership there are soi
o provide for government
if the money to buy the roade
found.
TO WELCOME FIRST nOME.
?Columbia Council Donates $1,000 to
Entertain Regiment?Second In?
fantry Remains at Rorder.
Columbia, Nov. 26.?At a joint con?
ference of the members of the city
council and the directors of the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday a
donation of $1,000, if so much be
necessary, was agreed upon for the
purpose of entertaining the First reg
, iment after its arrival in Columbia
from the border to be mustered out.
j The details of the entertainment
j will be loft with the Clumber of Com?
merce and the date wil; not be set
until Col. Blythe can a nnounce what
time will be convenient to him. It
will probably be Friday or Saturday
December 1 or 2, and the present ten?
tative programme is that the regiment
will be brought by train from Styx
and will parade through the streets, at
which time the citizens, it is hoped,
will come out to give them a royal
welcome along the line oC march. Af?
ter this parade they will probably be
given the liberty of the city and mu?
sic and certain amusements, which
i will be decided on later. It is hoped
I that not only the citizens of Columbia
but the citizens from other places
i will be here to join in this welcome.
The four Columbia companies are
in the Second regiment. No announce?
ment has been made about the return
of the Second regiment at an early
date. It is presumed that a similar
entertainment will be arranged for
these young men upon their return
to South Carolina.
