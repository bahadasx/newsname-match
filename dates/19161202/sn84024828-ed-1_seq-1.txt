MEN
By WILLIAM P. De WOLF
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Dec 1. Among
the men rnntrrfcrntPd at .Te-
rome the conviction prevails that cop
per ore bodies of value are' distribut
b o"o- -
cd generally throughout a wide area in
the Verde district, and that depth, and
development will disclose deposits of
copper well beyond the confines of the
"pay" belt as at present recognized,
equal in value to those opened in the
United Verde, United Verde Extension
field for many years. S. F. Denison,
treasurer, is identified with the admin
istration Of the mining and other in
terests of the late G. W. Hull, former
owner of the Hull Copper and other
properties that were recently sold to
W. A. Clark of the United Verde mine
for $1,000,000, E. W. Carroll, secre
tary, is prominent in the business and
mining affairs of the Verde district,
and Copper Chief mines. This convic
tion is based upon gsological condi
tions similar to those prevailing in the
immediate vicinity of Jerome, where
are located the United Verde and
United Verde Extension mines; and
the fact that commercial copper ore is
being shipped regularly from the Cop-,
per Chief mine, located well to the
south of the properties mentioned.
Out on the Verde north fault, be
yond the Arkansas and Arizona and
Jerome Victor Extension properties,
the mineral conditions at surface are
identical with those nearer Jerome and
hold forth promise of similar oppor
tunities to mine at a profit. The same
limestone and iron capping, iron
stained porphyry and monzonite which
overlies the rich copper ores in the im-
' mediate vicinity of Jerome, and which
were the guides to their location, can
be traced for several miles beyond the
A. & A. ground across the properties
ot the Jerome-Superior, Jerome Daisy
and VeVde Copper Development com
panies. To the south of Jerome simi
lar mining conditions prevail at sur
face on the estates of the Michigan
Verde, United Verde Consolidated,
per belt is the most extensive as" well
as the richest ever discovered,
velopment estate should not be as gen
erally valuable as those underlying the
United Verde estate. It is not to be
the copper ore bodies underlying the
iron capping on the Verde Copper De
Boston and Jerome and other com
panies that are operating within the
Verde mine and this side of the Cop
per Chief mine. By reason of these
unusual surface showings the belief is
spreading that the United Verde cop
territory lying beyond the United
Similarity of Outcrop
'If a piece of the iron capping which
features the property of the Verde
Copper Development company were
on the iron outcrop of the
United Verde estate, it would be im
possible to distinguish the lormer
t mm the latter. The two outcrops are
identicaly in appearance and possess
the same mineral charac-
teristics. If anything, the Verde Cop-
per Development outcrop is tnencner,
Lcnauwc ' . . ,
for it carries as hign as ""'Uftrncteristie of the country in the
iron and 1.1 per cent copper w "'
ton. The geological structure oi tne
and there appears to,be no reason y
two properties appears to be the same,
understood from the foregoing that
the Verde Copper Development people
have at this time an estate equal in
value to that of the United Verde com
pany. It does, however; offer similar
potentialities within the confines of its
1240 acres. .
By reason of its mineral showing
and mineral yielding possibilities the
property is viewed with favor by the
mining men ot this section and is re
ceiving their financial support Walter

company, is manager of the T. F. Mil

of practical experience in the copper
districts of the country. One of these

the.
great north fault It samples high in
iron and carries traces of copper, gold
and silver. The erosion that has taken
. ,
place here and at other points on the
;. acreage has disclosed favorable geo-
logical conditions which are hidden by
the sedimentary lime and sandstone
nearer Jerome. These conditions are
indicative of the value of the underly
ing ore bodies and are as generally fa
vorable as those disclosed at any point
alone the course of the fault. By rea
son of the greater erosion it is prob
able the area of commercially valuable
copper ore lies much closer to surface
here than it did in the United Verde
mine, where the overburden was heav
ier. The importance of this fact lies
in the possibilities it offers for open
ing up ore at a not excessive depth and
cost'
A number of shallow shafts and tun
nels have been driven at various points
on the acreage, and in nearly every in
stance have resulted m the discovery
of conoer indications. This is par
ticularly true of the workings located
in the vicinity of the two iron out
crops. The work now being done is
purely preliminary, but it will serve
as a guide to future operations and
as a base for the development of the
ground at depth. The deepest shaft is
down 85 feet It shows considerable
copper mineralization, and while it is
the sedimentary formation, carries the
mineralogical earmarks of making
into commercial ore at depth. The
slope of the hill adjacent to this shaft,
and the gulch below it ,are covered
with float that has eroded from the
outcrop. The float ranges in size from
an egg to massive boulders, and is so
heavy with iron that pieces the size
of a "man's hand not infrequently
weieh from one to three pounds. A
permanent camp has been established
nearby and in its vicinity will be lo
cated the three-compartment deep
working shaft the company plans to
sink. This is to be equipped with
powerful and modern mine machinery.
The latter will be freighted to the site
via the old ore road to Ash Fork, for
merly used by the United Verde com
pany ,and a road the Verde Copper
Development company will build to
connect therewith about three miles
from Jerome.
Area to the South
A number of recently organized
companies are busy developing tneir
acreages south of the United verae
and United Verde Extension mines.
The section is one which holds very
encouraging mineral yielding possibili
ties and is viewed with favor by tne
mining men of the camp. The Michigan-Verde
Copper company is outlin

estate at dentil and expects to have

(From Saturday's Dally Miner)
George W. Mark, manager of the
Missouri-Mohave Mining company, is
preparing to do a large amount of
work on the Alma C, Ellen L. and
I Ruth mining claims at Cerbat The
company is incorporated for 250,000
one-dollar shares. J. V. Lee is presi
dent, Al H. Hitchings, vice-president,
and Clarence T. Case secretary and
treasurer, all of St Louis. "
Mr. Mark purposes sinking a new
shaft on the north end of the Alma
C. claim to a depth of 200 feet and
drifting both ways on the vein. A
raise will be made to the old shaft
On the Ellen L. it is proposed to run
a crosscut tunnel, a distance of about
150 feet, cutting the vein below the
present shaft Drifting will be car
ried on along the vein and the whole
vein system exploited. In this work
future development .will be predecated.
The company is well financed to carry
on the extensive campaign outlined.
The property is one of the most invit-'
ing in the Cerbat field and should
prove up one of the big producers of
the camp.
NICKELL PREPARING
T
(From Saturday's Dally Miner)
C. N. Nickell, the merchant, is one
of the most active and hard working
fellows in Kingman. Every evening
he is to be seen in his store making
preparations for the holiday trade.
With the new addition and many
labor saving devices installed recently
he has one of the most up-to-date
stores in Arizona.
Mr. Nickell has one of the largest
holiday stocks ever brought into Mo
have county and in the evemngs his
show windows are a blaze of light and
color.
Prescott; L. E. Hesla, mining and
business man of Prescott, and E. C.
Farrell, mining and business man of
Clarkdale. Boston and Jerome shares
are closely held, there being less than
30,000 available for purchase at this
time, and are in active demand, ine
stock is listed on the San Francisco
stock exchange. Early this month it
will be called on the New York Curb at
an opening price of 75 cents per share.
Is an Active Trader
Seventy-five thousand shares of the
United Verde Consolidated Copper
company were sold at $1 per share or
above on November 23d, the day the
stock was called for the first time on
the New York Curb. This was an ad
vance of 25 cents per share over the
prelisting price and was sustained to
a considerable degree by buying or
ders from Jerome, Prescott Bisbee
and other Arizona points. The stock
continues in active demand and a price
of $2 per share is being predicted by
January 1, 1917.
The conviction is becoming general
in this section that the Jerome Victor
Extension Copper company's property
will he a producer within a few
months. The drive toward the United
Verde workings on the 1200-foot level
continues to show favorable copper in
dications, and the chances are strongly
fnvnmhle to the nicking up of the ex
tension of the United Verde ore body
during the next few weeks. -The face
of the drive shows chalcopyrite ano
iron Tjvrites and appears to be nearing
the point where a body of copper ore
will be encountered. The company has
the hacking of a number of prominent
copper mine operators of the Lake &a
perior country and has an ample treas'
lirv fund. An overburden of water for
la time hampered mining operations
considerably. Ofate, however,- uie
water has been handled without dif
ficulty and the work has been prose
cuted exDeditiously and to good pur
pose. There is a steady demand for
Jerome Victor Extension shares at
from $2.25 to ?2.75 per share, and
once the drive on the 1200-foot level
enters the ore there is little question
but the stock will advance sharply and
appreciably in price.
From Saturday's Dally Miner
Anson H. Smith and wife yesterday
visited the Arizona Tellurium mine,
situated about 16 miles east of King
man. They founld the camp well sit
uated, there being commodious build
ings for the accommodation of the
management and employes.
Work is being carried on in a shaft
that has reached a depth of 170 feet
and a crosscut tunnel about 150 feet
ThCshaft is now entering a change in
the vein, which indicates entry into
the sulphides. In the crosscut tunnel
a vein has been cut and on which drift
ing is now being carried along which
indicates good values. While the ore
streak is small the veins is widening
with every foot gained and the possi
bility is that a big vein of ore will
soon be encountered.
The company has one of the best
mineralized series of veins in the
mountains and with depth big bodies
of shipping-ore are almost certain to
be develoned. Along the surface
bunches of high grade gold-silver ore
has been found, but toward the water
level considerable leaching has occur
red and only the hard quartz retains
the values. The management of the
company is in the hands of George A.
Shea.
A. B. Harlan and wife are visitors
at the mine, Mr. Harlan being presi
dent of the company. It is probable
that he will remain here some time to
watch developments.

(From Sunday's Dally Miner.)
Soon after the arrival in Oatman
of Judge J. E. Ross on December 1,
active development work will be re
sumed at the famous old Leland prop
erty. He is coming here for the sole
purpose of making the necessary ar
rangements. The Leland is a part of the old
Vivian property which is situated one
mile west of the Tom Reed mine
It was worked years ago, and it is
said that good ore was discovered at
that time but owing to the death of
the owner its development ceased and
it has been idle for years. At one
time the owner of the property built
a railroad from Needles to the prop
erty and erected a small mill to han
dle the ore then in sight
After the death of the owner every
thing was closed down and the rail
road and its rolling stock was allowed
to go to ruin. Two years ago the
rails were taken up and shipped to
Nevada. At present the only indica
tion that Oatman ever had a railroad
is the old roadbed which is to be seen
'at several points between Oatman and
Needles.
It is said that the property has
been fully financed and that within a
short time after the arrival of Judge
Ross a program of development work
i will be announced.
