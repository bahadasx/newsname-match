9IG FIELD OF CANDIDATES
All the world loves a game sport,
who when ho loses 'takes his defeat
with a good grace and accepts the
Tesult philosophically when fortune
refuses to smile on him, but judg
ing from the attitude of Republican
National Committeeman Hert and
Republican State Central Commit
teeman Haswell they are not In a
very good humor over the recent de
feat. Both came out in published
statements this week venting their
.spleen on the liquor interests, whose
conduct In politics Mr. Hert says is
.becoming unbearable. Politicians
as a rulo don't know whether Mr.
Hert is aiming at J. W. McCulloch,
the Owensboro politician and for
mer Republican leader, when ho
condemns the liquor. men in politics,
but they do say that Mr. McCulloch
and 'his friends aro chuckling in
their sleeve over tho election result
In Kentucky. It will be Temembered
that this past summer after a great
T deal of political chicanery the
Owensboro man was turned down
by tho Republican convention dele
gates from Kentucky at the national
convention in Chicago, his place as
National Committeeman being given
to A. T. Hert, the millionaire and
new factor.
To many tills looked like a little
bit of. ingratitude on the part of
Kentucky Republicans, as Mr. Mc
Culloch had made some able fights
lor tho party in the past and was
well liked by both Democrats and
Republicans, his leadership being
due to merit and because of his
financial standing. Immediately
following tho convention new honors
were thrust upon Hert, the new
Moses of tho party, he being, made
"' "'Chairman df ,the Western, national"
campaign, and the RepubilcaiTpress
bristled with pre-election statements
of Chairman Hert, who told the
newspaper men that in addition to
the West being for Hughes the pub
Ite would seo old Kentucky in the
Republican column. There is no
doubt but thdt many of the Repub
lican leaders believed this latter
statement and the Eastern newspa
pers all put Kentucky In tho doubt
ful column. The day after election
it appeared that Wilson would have
about 18,000 majority In this State,
hut as the returns came in tho ma
jority kept piling up until it
reached close to 30,000, this being
beyond the most sanguine hopes of
the Democrats. That Mr. Hert was
lri good standing at O. O. P. head
quarters is shown In the final finan
cial statement published tho other
day, the Republican expense account
for Kentucky being over $64,000,
and it is a safe bet that this enor
mous amount was only allotted to
Kentucky because the Republican
campaign committee believed Mr.
Hert knew whereof he spoke.
No wonder the 'McCulloch faction
aro chuckling over tho result and
no wonder Mr. Hert and Mr. Has
well have como out for prohibition.
Mr.. Harwell's Indignation at the
liquor mon in politics probably
comes because of tho awful drub
bing he received on election day in
his raco for Congress. Ho was the
Republican nominee In tho Fourth
district against Congressman Ben
Johnson and was defeated by a record-breaking
majority for that dis
trict, which abounds in" distilleries,
"this latter faot probably accounting
for Mr. Haswell's grievance against
liquor in politics. The Louisville
Herald, which originally classed
Hughes" as a sphinx, but took that
end when it found Hughes' cam
paign money talked (the Herald get
ting 15,447.50), gives great promin
ence to the statements or rather
grievances of Messrs, Hert and Has
well and foolishly says that tho
districts which supported Hughes in
Kentucky are dry anyway. Tho
-only two districts carried by Hughes
:are tho Tenth and Eleventh, em
bracing tho entire moonshine whis
key district, where the Federal offi
cers have been working for half a
-century in destroying Illicit stills
and fighting with the mountain
moonshiners. And the Herald calls
these dry districts.
Hert and Haswell's advocacy of
-prohibition has already played
havoc In tho local Republican ranks,
as many of the local Republican
leaders see breakers ahead for
Axton's candidacy for Mayor and
"verifies tho statement made In these
columns beforo that Hort will not
support Axton, but wants Instead a
Tmslness friend of his to head tho
ticket. Axton can't espouse tho pro
hibition cause because of tho closo
-relation 'of his tobacco business to
the liquor business, and tho local
Axton leaders, Ous Neurath, Robert
Harris, Russell Hart, Bob Donahue,
Marshall Bullitt and others are con
nected with or aro closely identified'
with the liquor interests. The Chil-toa-gearcy
machine, which control's
the local G. O. P. organization, is
"in a pretty pickle, as Ms principal
workers are Axton men, bat the
machine will have to bow to the
-wishes of Hert or there will be
stotfttag daiag is the campUga fund
line. Another blow to Axton's pros
pects just now Is tho prohibition
platform of -the Republicans will
hardly bo received enthusiastically
by Axton's colored supporters who
can't forego their llttlo stick gin.
Local Democrats are tickled over
the prospects for next fall, as they
realize that with Mr. Hert declaring
for prohibition the local ticket
will necessarily have to make their
light on that platform, whether tho
Individual candidates desire to do
so or not. With this rosy prospect
In sight many Democrats are begin
ning to make their announcements
for the August primary. In addition
to tho names of Sheriff Charley
Cronan and ex-Mayor Head, Alder
man James B. Camp and ex-Mayor
Bingham are being touted by their
friends, it being rumored that ex
Mayor Bingham will take up a per
manent residence at tho Seelbach in
order to bo eligible. It may bo a
four-cornered race for County
Judge, as Judge Sam Greene, Lor
alne Mix, Tyler Barnett and Mark
Beauchamp look like starters. In
the Police Court Clerk's race Clay
Hall, Will Dennis and Harry Nehan
are mentioned, while it Is rumored
that a West End Democratic leader
will contest with Ed O'Connor for
Bailiff, Clem Huggins is being men
tioned as an uddltlon to the field
against Judge Boldrlck in the same
court.
Over in tho Court House much
Interest is being displayed in the
Sheriff's race and rumor has It that
If Al Emler is In bad health Alder
man Joe Overberg Is being groomed
by different leaders to step in the
breach, and if he does will set a
merry pace, being especially strong
with the ward Chairmen and pre
cinct workers. For somo reason or
another many are being mentioned
to contest with Pres Ray for the
lucrative office of County Clerk,
some saying that this is done be
cause of interference in other elec
tions of tho County Clerk's office, a
certain ex-official of the Court
House and his friends promising a
campaign fund for tho primary.
Charles Milllken, Dolph Schmltt and
Ben Brumlevo aro being mentioned
as possible starters.
Precinct committeemen will bo
chosen in the different districts this
afternoon, and with tho organization
of the committee announcements
and combinations will bo made by
the wholesale.
ADVENT.
Tho ecclesiastical year of the
church begins with the holy season
of Advent, about four weeks beforo
Christmas. For every faithful child
of tho church it ought to be a mat
ter of joy and thanksgiving that
with tho opening of this new year
of tho church begins also a season
of special devotion to tho Queen
of. Henven.. The word. Advent
means "the coming" and has refer
ence to tho coming of Jesus Christ,
tho world's Redemer. through tho
intervention of Mary the Virgin
Mothqr.
During these four weeks of Ad
vent tho church goes back in spirit
to tho four thousand years which
preceded the real and veritable
coming of Christ to tho earth, by
virtue of tho mystery of the in
carnation. During that long and
gloomy period of time tho world
sighed, yearned and hoped for tho
Mcsslas. Tho Lord had said sol
emnly to tho serpent tempter in
the garden, "I will put enmities be
tween thee and tho woman . . .
she shall crush thy head." From
the time those words were uttered
poor, fallen, helpless man ceased
not to long for tho coming of thai
Virgin who was to conceive and
bring forth tho Son who was to bo
called Emmanuel "God with us."
Thus Advent is not only a season
dovoted to tho Son of God made
man, but also to his highly fa
vored mother. If you would ob
serve every year tho holy timo of
Advent In union with your holy
church, then you'should pass those
solemn days in rejoicing that Mary
was chosen, In giving thanks be
cause sho accepted that sublime
dignity. As a means of giving out
ward practical expression to such
joy and such thanks, wo suggest to
ou tho beautiful dovotlon of tho
Angelus, and would recommend you
to perform It with unwonted fervor
at sunrise, noon and sunset.

TROUBLES.
Socialist Straight Jacket Pin
ches and Party experiencing
Much Difficulty.
Editor of tho Masses, Max East
man, Shows Signs of
Revolt.
The Socialist Party Is a Great
Mass of Uncertainty and
Factionalism. .
THEY DESERT THEIR PRINCIPLES
The American Socialist party is
experiencing much difficulty of late
In keplng its leading members in
line. They havo -a fatal tendency,
as-with -all radicals, to go off qirja
tangent and desert their organiza
tion and its principles. Tho Rov.
Dr. Lunn, two times Socialist Mayor
of Schenectady, was a noteworthy
example. He had much trouble
during the course of both adminis
trations to get along with his party
and finally was expelled from It for
not listening to the dictation of the
local on tho appointment of men to
public offices. He fired a parting
broadside at his former "comrades"
in the Metropolitan Magazine, tell
ing much about tho Socialist "ma
chine," and then completed his
revolt UUs last election by running
for Congress from that district
and being elected on tho Demo
cratlo ticket. The Socialists havo
taken such sonsolatlon as they can
from tho fact that ho is to bo suc
ceeded In Schenectady by Dr. Stela
mctz, elected as a Socialist, but
expelled from tho party for tho
samo reason as caused Lunn's de
fection. Now comes Max Eastman, editor
of tho Masses, to tell his story of
complaint. Tho Socialist party Is
dangerously near being a sect, he
saysr instead of tho political in
strument of tho working class. The
wholo trouble Is that during the
last election "Comrade" Eastman
publicly expressed his preference'
for ono of tho candidates of the
"old parties" rather than for the
other, and tho Socialists did not
like that at all. They said all sorts
of unkind things about him for not
supporting their own candidate In
tho proper manner. In tho De
cember issue of his publication
"Comrade" Eastman replies in his
characteristic way. Ho gives a very
frank opinion of those who havo
"excommunicated" him for Issuing
tho statement that ho did.
What tho Socialist party has to
do now, ho says, "is to get rid of
all this sectarian dogmatism, this
doctrinaire, Index oxpurgatorlus
modo of thinking and this Infatua
tion with an organization as an
end in itself. Let us try to use
our brains freely, lovo progress
more than a party, allow ourselves
tho natural emotions of our species,
and seo if we can get ready to play
a human part in the actual com
plex flow of events. Tho great wis
dom of Karl Marx brought into the
ranks of social idealists was the
recognition of the fact that the
world will novor bo saved by cranks.
It will bo saved by great masses
of normal beings acting in accord
with the deepest instincts of naturo.
In tho name of Marx, however, the
Socialist party of America Is trying
to become a party of puro cranks.
Too mnny of its members want it
to bo a party of puro cranks. That
Is tho trouble with it. That is why
tho membership falls off although
tho voto increases."
That is a very valuable bit of
Information for somo people to take
to heart and remember. There is
a temptation for workingmen to
think that within the ranks of the
Socialist party is to be found the
solution of all their difficulties. The
Socialist, in speaking to one as yet
without the pale, pictures all things
so beautifully, and appeals to a
certain sense of selfish idealism,
making one fondly Imagine that in
the Socialist movement is to be
found only "comrades" battling
harmoniously together for the great

WOMEN PLOWING; IN FRANCE.
Franco have taken, up Uio labors of
have made it possible for Franco to
ideal. But stories; such as this
and much other evidence that is
available will show that this is not
tho case. The Socialist party is a
great mass of uncertainty and fac
tionalism. It is bound to be so. All
revolutionary movements work In
this way. Throwing asido tho basic
Idea of principle, they find that they
must have somo shadow of principle
at least to go by (If they wish In
any way to proceed. Accordingly
Ideas and Ideals are adopted which

the fate of all sects and extremist
movements of any kind Because of
this they accomplish so very llttlo

whom they are designed to aid.
In the Socialist party tho working
man will not find a movement for

TOM WATSON
Is Again On Trial For Sending
Obscene Articles Through
Mails.
Jury Selected and Case Started
Monday in the Federal
Court.
Frequently Called Down By
United States .Tudgo
Lambdin.
BIGOT MAKES A POOR SHOWING
The jury to try Thomas E. Wat
son in the Federal District Court .at
Augusta, Ga., on charges of, having
senUobscene llteraturo through the
nialls,--was 'Selected, shortly- before
noon Monday and calling of wit
nesses to try the case was Imme
diately begun. Both sides appeared
anxious not to delay going to trial,
and little time was lost, Watson
acting as his own lawyer. The
articles cited wero used in con
nection with attacks on the Roman
Catholic church, and the publisher
claimed at his previous trial that
certain of the phrases mentioned In
the Indictment wero taken from
treatises dealing with the doctrine
of that church, which had gono
through the mails unquestioned.
Before court recessed the case of
the Government and the defense
had been outlined and the first wit
ness examined. Tho District Attor
ney claimed he would show Watson
was responsible for mailing the
articles, and that they were obscene,
and that this was all that was nec
essary for conviction.
Watson asserted that the lan
guage used was allowable because
of its motive, and cited classical
works which he said the "law might
ban." Ho also declared portions of
the matter referred to were taken
from Roman Catholic- theologies in
Latin, and asserted that the Roman
Catholic church "prosecutes people
for telling Protestants what's in"
the theologies.
J. Q. West, Postmaster at Thom
son, was put on tho stand by tho
prosecution to show Watson's re
sponsibility for mailing tho articles.
Tho defendant declined to admit
this responsibility, as he had done
at his previous trial.
Announcement that tho Govern
ment would ask for a mistrial if
Thomas E. Watson, acting as his
own counsel "continued to introduce
extraneous matter" into the case,
an exchange of remarks between
Watson and United States District
Attorney Donaldson which led Pre
siding Judge Lambdin to request no
"personal remarks between counsel"
and warning from tho bench that if
the defendant became "excited and
can not control himself," ho would
not be allowed to act as his own
counsel, marked tho second day of
Watson's trial. Watson also said
"I'll answer to tho District Attor
ney himsolf outside tho Toom."
During this discussion, which
took place when at request of the
District Attorney the jury had been
excluded from tho room, Watson
charged that his Indictment and
trial on charges of having sent ob
scene matter through the mails was
a "most infamous persecution" and
that ho was "not surprised that tho
District Attorney is asharned of
himself." Ho also declared the
Roman Catholic church is behind
this case." After Judge Ldmbdln
had twice requested order Mr. Don
aldson informed the court that if
Watson continued "despite repeated
rulings of tho court" to assert that
"the Roman Catholic church is be
hind this prosecution," and to make
"similar statements" that the pro
secution would "be compelled to ask
for a mistrial." Judge Lambdin
stated that the indictment had been
regularly returned by a Federal
grand jury, that tho District Attor
ney when -ho came Into office found
the case on the docket, and that in
Federal courts the Government is
the sole prosecutor, and therefore
he ruled out "statements aa to mo
tives" or persoss sot eoaneeted with
; --I
tho Government being connected
with the case.
The Jury thon returned and the
prosecution began to introduce doc
umentary evidence by which it seeks
to prove Watson's connection with
mailing the alleged obscene matter.
Tho first hour Tuesday was taken
up with attempts on tho part of the
defense to introduce various books
and publications, which it was
claimed contained matter similar to
that in Issues of tho Jeffersonlan
and Watson's Magazine cited In tho
Indictment. These wero ruled out.
Watson was overruled In his efforts
to compare his works with publica
tions of United States Government
bureaus. Presiding Judge W. W.
Lambdin uphold tho objection of
District Attorney Earlo M. Donald
son. Watson, acting as his own
counsel, also was overruled in at
tempts to show the motlvo Inspiring
the articles cited In tho Indictment
and on various other legal points.
In an address beforo 800 Macon
men at tho Capital Theater at
Macon Monday afternoon, Dr. W.
N. Alnsworth, pastor of Mulberry
Street Methodist church and a
leader In tho South Georgia Con
ference, declared Thomas E. Wat
son, tho Thomson editor, to bo
Georgia's most dangerous man.
"Somo men's thoughts and speech
make them veritable forces of infec
tion," said Dr. Alnsworth, "blasting
with careless thought and wicked
speech a vast population of people.
In my judgment, tho Hon. Thomas
E. Watson, endowed by Almighty
God with as brilliant a mind as any
Georgian in this generation, has be
come so embittered that all the
Juices of his soul have turned to
vinegar, until his writings and lead
ership constitute him the most dan
gerous man in Georgia today."

Planning to Placate Ireland as
Hatred For England
Grows.
British Lenders Consider Im
mediate Enforcement of
Home Rule.
May Try Voluntary Enlistment
Campaign Under Duke of
Conuaught.
SINN FEIN HAS MULTIPLIED
Tho New York Tribune's London
correspondent says no responsible
Englishman attempts to minimize in
tho slightest degree the present
position of affairs in Ireland. With
out going Into the merits of tho
executions of tho leaders of tho
rebels, it Is common knowledgo that
tho number of Sinn Felners since
tho rebellion has multiplied enor
mously. It Is practically admitted
that the country seethes with tho
bitterest hatred of England. Take
ono small Instance. It is impossible,
whatever might be the wages of
fered, to persuade an Irish maid
servant to accept work across tho
Channel. Englishmen generally,
both from policy and inclination,
aro anxious to put an end to this
state of affairs, which in tho midst
of a desperate war can only be de
scribed as dangerous. It is no
longer merely a question of home
rule. There are two points involved
of vital importanco to tho British
Empire. One is that Englnod is
fighting with a vicious enemy at
her back. Tho other is that Ireland
has, to all intents and purposes,
ceased to 6end recruits to tho Brit
ish army, which needs them badly.
The problem is whether a settle
ment can be reached which will
solve both questions at once. Among
tho Innermost governing circles a
belief is growing that such a solu
tion is possible. The central part
of the plan, which may be put in
operation any moment, Is tho imme
diate enforcement of home rule,
which has been on the statute book
for mbro than two years. This move
would domuoh4o romovedieeatifc--
factlon in Ireland, and would un
questionably lessen the distrust of
England. The next step, it is sug
gested, would bo to make an effort
to carry on the government of Ire
land for the time being by a com
mittee of six, giving two members
to each of the three main sections
in Ireland.
Redmond and Devlin would of
course represent the Nationalists,
Carson and possibly Col. Craig
might represent tho Orangemen.
There is good reason to believe that
tho Sinn Felners would bo content
to leave themselves in the hands of
George Russell the famous Irisli
poet and Sir Horace Plunkott. If
these six could bo induced to work
together it seems as if a largo
amount of union could bo obtained
in Ireland. It Is thought that Sir
Edward Carson and John Redmond
would have no objection to a co
operation of this kind. Thero is
more doubt whether tho Sinn Feln
ers would consent to associate with
tho Nationalists.
All responsible people now agree
that to attempt to force conscrip
tion on the Irish in tho present
state of feeling would bo simply
inviting disaster. It Is unquestion
ably a matter for persuasion and
not force. And It Is accordingly
suggested that If a new form of
government can remove tho distrust
of the Irish and win back their good
will, then a voluntary recruiting
campaign on a great scale should
bo started. There is talk of plac
ing tho Duko of Connaught, who Is
extremely popular in Ireland, at the
head of tho campaign, and undoubt
edly his personal Influence would go
far toward success. Many highly
placed and level-headed people, who
know Ireland, think that tho scheme
is worthy of trial. They rely partly
on the known characteristics of
Irishmen. It is a mistake to think
that Ireland Is Indifferent to tho
fate of other small nations.
The substitution of Gen, Sir
Bryan McMahon for Sir John Max
well as Commander-in-Chief of tho
army In Ireland is tho first Indica
tion of a change in tho policy of
