TWO FLANKING
MOVEMENTS ON
RUMANIAN FRONT
One by Russians to Save King
Ferdinand's Armies and
Capital
TEUTONS MAKE OTHER
Try to Force Evacuation of
Bucharest and Cut Off
Defenders
Indications point to the probability
that two flanking operations on a
large scale are in progress on the Ru
manian front. The one apparently
is intended by the Russians to save
King Ferdinand's armies and possibly
his capital, and the other by the Teu
tonic allies to force the evacuation of
Bucharest and cut off the troops de
fending it.
Having assembled what seems to
he a huge force along the range of the
lower Carpathians, the Russians are
pressing a great offensive on a front
approximately 250 miles running along
the western frontier of the Rumanian
province of Moldavia and extending
northwest along the Bukowina bor
der. Already they are declared to
have scored such successes as to lead
to expectations that the supply lines of
General Von Falkenhayn's armies in
vading Rumania from the north may
shortly be seriously menaced.
The threat to the Rumanians conies
from Field Marshall Von Mackensen
on the southeast. Controlling virtual
ly the entire cojrse of the Danube as
far as Tchernavoda, as they do, the
Teutonic allies, it has been pointed
out, seemed likely to attempt throw
ing forces across it at points further
and further east, to outflank each line
taken up by the Rumanians as they
retired under the pressure of Von Fal
kenhayn's forces from the north and
west, and such of Von Mackensen's
troops as were already on the north
bank of the river
Try to Hem In Rumanians
Entente commentators point out
that such a move may now have been
effected, taking the mention by Petro
grad that hostile patrols have appear
ed near Lake Griaka as Indicated that
a new crossing has been made by Von
Mackensen near Oltenitsa, southeast
of Bucharest, except to the northeast
and If carried far enough would alto
gether cut off their retreat.
The crisis in Greece seems to have
passed for the present with the an
nouncement from Athens that King
Constantino has agreed to give up the
artillery demanded by the entente and
that the allied forces which were land
ed are being withdrawn, an armistice
having been arranged! Before this
panic has reigned in Athens with an
exchange of tire between Greeks and
entente marines. During the fighting

Cannon Admires Wilson
and Here's His Reason
Pittsburgh, Dec. 2. "What do 1
think of Woodrow Wilson? Why, I
admire him. I admire any man who
can pray with one hand and play
poker with the other."
This was "Uncle Joe" Cannon's
characterization of the President last
night as he slopped off in Pittsburgh
en route from Danville, 111., to Wash
ington.
"I am wearing no mourning as a re
sult of the outcome of the presidential
fight," he smiled. "Ever hear of the
two negroes who were stealing chick
ens? The one on the inside of the
coop became conscience-stricken and
asked the one on the outside:
" 'Mose, do you thing dis am de right
thins: to do?'
" 'Nevah min' dat. righteousness
stuff. Jus' han' me out anuvver un.'
"That's the position of the Repub
licans. We are getting ready to hand
out another one in 1920,"

COAL TO STAY HIGH
Charleston, W. Va., Dec. 2.—The
bituminous coal shortage and high
prices per ton will continue through

which will offset any increased output
brought about by a more liberal car

Humble Left-Over and Even
Cold Breakfast Foods Have
Possibilities
[By Mrs. Anna Hamilton Wood]
SOME women economize because
they are compelled to do so and
feel a deep sense of injury there
by, some are by nature thrifty and
saving in all things; still others in
tend and want to conduct their house
holds so that every cent will count
but. do not. know just how to go about
it. I hope the following list of tasty
dishes made from left-overs may be
of use to at least some of these house
wives.
Potato Bisque
Put two or three cold boiled pota
toes or cold baked potatoes with skins
removed through the ricer. If there
is a saucer of cold mashed or creamed
potatoes it will do as well.
Add to the potato four cups of hot
milk, half a small onion chopped fine,
j salt, pepper and celery salt. Let boil
High Cost of Wrapping
Paper Causes Big Stores to
Adopt Economy Measures
New York, Dec. 2.—The high cost
of wrapping paper has caused depart
ment and other retail stores to insti
tute many novel methods of economy.
The various grades of heavy paper
used for wrapping, as well as of tissue
paper used for inside wrapping, have
advanced in price, it is stated, between
300 and 400 per cent, in the last
eighteen months.
Some of the larger stores have sub
stituted lightweight paper Tor heavy,
are using a cheaper grade of tissue
and have abandoned entirely the wrap
ping up of pasteboard boxes. This
change alone, it was said, has saved
many tons of paper. Group action is
being discussed to effect further econo
mies and at the same time avoid ap
pearing "cheap" in the eyes of cus
tomers.
To Take Census of Amount
and Cost of Pulp Wood Used
Washington, D. C., Dec. 2.—A cen
sus of amount and cost of pulp wood
consumed in tho United States is to be
taken by tho Federal Forest Service
in co-operation with the Newsprint
Manufacturers' Association, it was an
nounced to-day. The statistics are
needed, it is explained, because of the
scarcity of pulv> wood. Comparative
figures showing the total pulp wood
consumed for 1*99. 1908, 1914 and
1916 are to be compiled.
