BRITISH CABINET
SIIAKEUP COMING,
REPORTS ASSERT
More forceful Conduct of War
Demanded,
LONDON, Dec. 2 Rumor is still!
busy with reports of changes in thr i
cabinet or at any rate in the war mini-
cil, as a result of the agitation brj
more forceful conduct of the war. The
general impression is that a smaller
war rouncil with the infusion of new
blood is contemplated, but nothing def
inite lias hern announced yet.
Conferi With King.
Premier Asnuitli was in conference
with the king this morning but whether
it bad to do with contemplated changes
in the administration or with the pro-
f ram which the house of commons will
ace next week, is problematical.
Changes involving the resignation of
Premier Asmiith are predicted hv the
Manchester (iuardian in an article in
today's issue on thr currrnt rumors re
specting political changes. The paper
says :
Lloyd-George in View.
"Rumors, perhaps one might to say
more than rumors, are going around
in the lobby of imminent changes, the
current rumor being that llonar Law
may replace Premier Asnuith for the
time being, but that a final settlement
would be Lloyd-fieorge as premier."
The (iuardian concludes that thr
coalition government has not the pres
tige to resist the attack being made
upon it and the house has reached the
mood in which it is ready to create
another ministry.
