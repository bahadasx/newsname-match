WASHINGTON IS MUCH WORRIED
Villa's Success Seriously Threatens
Carrama's Prestige in Northern
States of Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., Dec. 2. Gen. Gon
zales, commander of the Carranza gar
rison at Jeurez, stated today that
Gen. Murguia was on his way south
with a large force of troops and that
he was expected to attack the city
of Chihuahua on two sides at day
break today."
"Washington, Dec. 1. The situation
in northern Mexico Is authoritatively
described as extremely grave and offi
cials here fear a complete collapse of
Carranza's control over the territory
contiguous to the American border.""
It has been long admitted that the
loss of Chihuahua city to Carranze ser
iously threatened his control In north
ern Mexico. It means In one sense
that Villa graduates from a bandit to
tho dignity of a revolutionary leader.
It Is said by officials here that the
United States will not cease to regard
him as a bandit no matter what his
future power may be, and that he will
be shot or hanged for murder if cap
tured. WEATHER FOECAST

Reports lhat there was stolen at Portland, Maine,
August 25th several hundred dollars in U. S government
legal tender notes' lhese notes had never been used and
had been in the possession of their owner for 30 yeais.
Had the owner of this money instead of keeping
them in his pocketbook deposited one thousand dollars in
the Bennington County Savings Bank 30 years ago the
thousand dollars would now amount to $3243.
It is unwise to carry your money around where it
may be stolen. Put it in the Bennington County Savings
Bank where it will be sate and let the bank work for you.
You will be astonished at the way the deposit will grow
from year to year.

MAIL YOUR PARCELS EARLY
Postmaster-General Seeks to Encour
age. Movement.
Expecting heavier Christmas mails
than ever before, because of the
"general prosperity prevalent through
out tho country," Postmaster-General
Burleson. at Washington yesterday
announced he had begun through
postmasters, a nation-wido "mail
early campaign'1 Postmasters have
been authorized to employ all possible
means to deliver the holiday mail, and
have been instructed to advertise in
every proper way suggestions to the
public that parcels be mailed early,
addressed plainly and ' wrapped se
curely; that care bo taken to affix
sufficient postage and that parcels
may be indorsed "not to be opened
until Christmas."
Early mailing is especially neces
sary, I'ostmaster-General Burleson
says, because Christmas falls on
Monday, and all parcels should be
mailed in time for delivery on Satur
day, December 23. The postmaster
general says a little forethought on
the part of the public in mailing gifts
early would enable men and women
In the postal service to share the hol
iday spirit and to be freed from their
duties for at least a part of Christ
mas day.

AIDING
IN DEFENCE OF
Germans Occupy Two Towns

RUSSIANS LOSE PRISONERS
British "Tanks" Being Used in At
tacks on Bulgarian Lines of
Dobruja.
London, Doc. 2. The Rumanians,
probably aided by Russian troops, are
desperately defending the southern
and western approaches to Bucharest,
while the Teutonic advance continues
to press more closely on tho Ruman
ian capital from the northwest. Un
officially It is reported in London that
Russian troops have arrived In Bu
charest to aid the hardpressed Ru
manian forces.
Progress for the advancing German
and Austro-Huugarian armies in Wal
l.ichla and south of Bucharest Is re
ported by Herlin, which says the Ru
manians continue to offer resistance.
The Rumanians apparently are on or
near the line of the Argeshu, as
Petrograd says the Invaders have oc
cupied two towns south of Bucharest
and near that river. Eield Marshal
von Mackensen, Berlin records, has
thrown an army across tho Niaslov
lowlands, which would be approach
ing the Argeshu in the direction of
Bucharest.
Advancing southward from the
Campulung-Plteshll region, the Teuton
invaders have taken prisoners and
cannon and much other equipment
from the retiring Rumanians. In the
fighting reported in the latest com
niuniques, Herlin says the Rumanians
lost more than 2800 prisoners and 21
cannon.
The Russiaus continue aggressively
their offensive against the Austro
Gernian lints, from the Carpathians to
southern Transylvania. Berlin states
the Russian attacks, which are de
clared to have been along a front of
1S6 miles from Jablonitza to Kedzl
Vasrhely. resulted in only smnll ad
vantages, wihch are declared not to bo
commensurate with the cost in men
and ammunition. Petrograd admits a
repulse southwest of Vakarka In the
Carpathians, but records the capture
of a ridge of higlits south of Kirlibaba.
The fighting in Dobrudja has be
come more intense. Bucharest an
nounces a violent attack along the
whole front In that region. Berlin
declares that the attack against the
Bulgaiiun left wing in Dobrudja failed
and that British "tanks" are being
used by the attackers.
In Galicia there has also been a re
awakening of activity. Petrograd
records that an Austro-German at
tempts to take the offensive north of
the Tarnopol ZIoczow railway was re
pulsed. REV. C. C. WILSON WINS SUIT
Miss Johnson Must Drop Attempt to
Collect for Breach of Promise
Burlington, Nov. 27. The breach of
promise case of Miss Iaura Louise
Johnson against Rev. Charles Chase
Wilson has ended with an entry on
tho docket of tho United States Dis
trict court in Massachusetts that "no
further suit shall be brought for the
same alleged cause of action."
Tho suit attracted much attention
when It was tried In Boston several
months ago. The plaintiff was at one
time a student in the University of
Vermont and Mr. Wilson was an Epis
copal curate in this city. Evidence
introduced In the trial showed that
both parties were one of the social
set which participated in what has
been termed "high speed" functions
at Fort Ethan Allen.

BUCHEREST
ILLUSTRATED BIBLE
Splendid Book Offered By Banner at
Low Price.
Most of us know the boundaries of
our own state, or at least our own
county, but we little realize the edu
cational value to be gained from an
occasional hour devoted to reading
of other lands.
Take, for Instance, Palestine, which
is described as a narrow strip of
country at the eastern end of tho
Mediterranean sea, etretchlng north
and south 140 miles, and from 30 to
40 miles east and west, covering in
Us entirety an area of only 1,200
square miles. Why, most of our states
cover from five to ten. times as much
space, the Btate of Texas alone con
taining more than 20 times the area
of Palestine.
Of all of the lands of the earth,
Palestine is one of the most interest
ing, for in this small country orig
inated a volume that is familiar to
all the Bible. It has often been a
question of wonderment that such a
small portion of our earth could be
instrumental in producing a work so
universally known. And yet small
countries have given to the world
some of its greatest treasures. Take
for instance Greece, England, Italy
and Egypt; all of them are small, yet
they have been world leaders in some
one or another characteristic.
Today there is not a place on our
planet which is more thoroughly
studied and known than this 1,200
square miles of Palestine. Even in
our own generation, every foot of It
has been surveyed. Our geologists
have gone through the rocks botan
ists have gathered and classified its
plants, and zoologists have collected
and arranged its animals. Maps have
been made that show every moun
tain, valley, lake and river, as well
as cities and villages.
In Palestine are to be found all "the
rock formations, as well a3 all of the
flora and fauna known to tills earth.
Between the high altitudes of its
mountains with their perpetual snow
and tepid waters of the Salt sea,
every climate is experienced, in
which there is every living thing
that is known, to tho earth. So it
has been truthfully said that Pales
tine is the whole world in a nutshell.
By reading1 the foregoing, one may
pet a slight glimpse of tho interest
ing knowledge set forth in the New
Illustrated Bible, which Is being dis
tributed by Too Banner. This
magnificent volume contains 600 text
illustrations prepared by the world's
greatest artist at tho enormous cost
of 50, 000, aside from the numerous
full-page colored plates from the fa
mous Tissot collection. .Every pict
ure accurately portrays a scene that
throws a true light on the particular
subject which it accompanies. Some
Bibles lay claim to "Illustrations."
where they simply have "pictures'"
inserted at random, without regard
to the subjects. Those may be said
to entitle the volume to the world "il
lustrated," but it must be admitted
that they have no educational value.
Inasmuch as they have no bearing on
particular subjects which they ac
company. The .New illustrated litDie
which The Banner distributes Is
the only ono that truly illustrates the
exact subject related to it in position
as well as in matter.
SENT TO REFORMATORY
Pitiful History of a Young and At
tractive Bennington Girl.
In the district court at North
Adams last Thursday a young Ben
nlngton girl, not yet eighteen years
old, was sentenced to tho reformatory
lor women at Sherborn, Mass. Tho
previous night tho girl approached a
police officer and asked that she be
cared for, as slio was down and. out.
She was given a comfortable room in
the upstairs part of the police sta
tion. Meantime Chief of Tolice Dineen
communicated with Chief Brazell of
Bennington and learned that the girl
had been reared amid Immoral sur
roundings and had been without a
home for many months, the greater
part of that time having been spent
in North Adams and vicinity. As
there is no reformatory institution
for women in Vermont other than tho
stato prison, it was deemed best to
send hor to Sherborn.
A few weeks ago the girl visited
lloosick Kails, and an observant and
kind-hearted Christian lady took her
in charge and had her assigned to
the care of the humane officials of
Bennington, but tho girl strayed
away and went to North Adams.
Notwithstanding the sordid surround
ings of her life at home, the young
girl is attractive in appearance and
pleasing In manner. lloosick Falls

BOSTON CAMPAIGN
13 EXPENSIVE,
SAYS SUNDAY
Work There Costs Almost Twice
as Much as in Cther Cities
LARGE AFTERNOON ATTENDANCE
Matinee Audience Breaks All Previ
ous Day Time Records at the
Tabernacle.
Boston, Dec. 1. Billy Sunday pre
faced 'his sermon on "Mothers" to
night with an admonitory talk on tho
financing of the campaign.
For the second time since he came
here, Billy talked on tho same themo
afternoon and evening. The attend
ance in the afternoon was 12,000 and
there were more than 13,000 present
at night. That was the largest mati
nee attendance of the revival. The
trailer.? in the afternoon hit another
week day matinee record 520. At
night there were 473 converts.
"The work in Boston," he said,
"costs, I will not say twice as much,
but at least a third more than it has
ccst In other cities. You know how
much you pay to go to the world ser
ies, and if people would only do as
much for religion as they do for other
matters we should have tens of
thousands of dollars.
"Ycu know you couldn't poko your
head into the world series without pay
ing. Yet you are at liberty to dead
beat it if you wish at the tabernacle.
People never think of getting ou a
street car without paying a fare or on
getting goods from a grocery without
money. '
"In the lodge you pay your own
initiation fee and your dues. You pay
for your purchases bo much a yard or
so much a pound, but you don't always
see tho necessity of paying tho ex
penses of your church. Barnum and
Bailey would not open their circus and
then come In and take a collection. If
they did they wouldn't get enough
money to buy nuts for the monkeys.
They know human nature too well for
that. I say this to show why we have
such hard w.ork to pry enough out of
the people's pockets. Let's try.
"You asked me to come and it's
your debt. We have stopped eating
eggs at seventy-five cents a dozen.
Yet It doesn't cost a hen any more
to lay an egg now than It used to. On
Sunday let's sue what you can do for
three services."
CONTROL WALES COAL MINES
Mirers and Owners Surprised
Government Plan.
By
The British government's decision
to assume control of all the coal
mines in .'outl! Wales under tho de
fenso of the realm act was announced
too late at London Wednesday night
to enablo commentators as yet to
gauge its probable effect. The an
nouncement was a surprise to both
sides in the miners' controversy and
judging from preliminary statements
by individuals, both miners and em
ployers are more or less dumbfounded.
Secretary Richards of the South
Wales miners' federation, declared em
phatically that the miners would op
pose such a measure unless it were
made applicable to tho coal mining
industry of tho whole country. A
majority of tho South Wales leaders
am now in London for a conference
regarding the threatened strike. They
will meet to consider the startling de
velopment in the situation. I
Mine owners seem as much at loss I
as the miners to understand the bear
ing of the new regulation. A brief
dispatch from Cardiff says that tho
news came to tho coal interests there
as a bomb shock. The executive com
mittee of the South Wales miners'
federation Thursday adopted a reso
lution reiterating the demand of the
federation for a 15 per cent Increase
in wages and demurring at govern
ment control of the collieries unloss
all tho coal fields of Great Britain are
brought under such control.

imously voted to make eligible to I
membership all descendants, both
sons and daughters, of soldiers who
served in the arm of the Potomac, as

through our descendants, and in order
to accomplish this purpose It is earn
estly desired that every member of

gratifying, resulting in some twenty
five of the younger generation joining
the society, and we hope the good
work will continue. Let the clarion
note "do it now" be heard and respon
ded to heartily, thereby perpetuating
the society of the Army of the Potom
