cial Club met nt tho Club rooms to
consider tho advisability of working
on tho roads. It was decided to post,
pono tho work owing to tho rain, ns
tho rona to bo surfaced was too mud
dy, nnd to haul loads over It would
havo dono nioro harm than good.
Mr. Schramm, president of tho
Rotary Club of Salt Lako City, ad
vised that they could not work on
the reads and that Good Roads day
would be declared for Wednesday,,
June 7. This decision met the np
pi oval of tho local committee very
much as by that time tho road to bo
surfaced will bo In much better con
dition for tho work nnd It will bo
possible to create a stronger senti
ment for tho movement.
Tho commlttco had worked very
diligently In getting tenms nnd men
to agree to come. At tho meeting it
was reported that over 115 teams and.
about GOO men had been promised and
agreed to work on tho road on Wed
nesday. However, tho committee nnd
pcoplo In general were not disappoin
ted as the rnm was worth more to.

Tho Republican reporter Is In pos
session of facts relating to a visit
here of Leon Done, a government ex
pert nnd Investigator, who Is looking
into tho sugar beet factory control
versy between private Interests nnd
tho Amalgamated Sugar Company.
It is said that word reached gov
ernment odlclals to tho effect that
the Amalgamated Interests expect to
erect a factory west of Smlthfleld,
regardless of whether or not tho prl
vato Interests erect a factory. It Is
further stated that tho same Inter
ests havo proffered a million dollar
bond to guaranteo tho erection of
this factory.
On tho other hand the prlvnto in
terests which havo gone so far as to
get several thousand acres of land
signed up and ha8 subscribed over
$250,000 for stock so that they too
will erect a factory.
The government interests in the
case, It Is said, is to see if the Amal
gamated Interests aro In violation of
tho Sherman Anti-Trust Law. A
thorough Investigation will bo made.
This Investigation has"" been started
from statements made by oftlclals of
tlw Amalgamated Sugar Company,
who wero hero at a meetlra; at tluj
residence of Parley P. Bingham of
Trenton, when about 25 beet raisers
woro present.

they did not see tho elk they found
evidences of their being several
miles east of Providence. Theso evi
dences wero shown from fresh (racks
encountered on the trip.
Tho boys report that thoy never
weathered a rougher storm, and when
