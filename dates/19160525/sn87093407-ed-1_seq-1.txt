WHAT MULHALL SAYS OF LOBBY
—"The talent of the Lobby is the best drilled, tha
most unscrupulous and the most diplomatic in public
life today."
—"It seldom hesitates at means to accomplish Its
ends."
—"Less than 3 per cent of the Lobby tries to ao>
complish its designs by honorable measures."
—"Its generals are the multi-millionaires—the steel,
oil. hardware, banking, railway and other great corpora
tions—and its corporals, the political bosses and
heelers of the big cities."
—"It is so powerful that it can reach ont and croak
almost any man."
—"The Lobby is today more vigorous, if more careful,
than ever before. It demands toll in some form from
every citizen of the United States."—Colonel Martin
M. Mulhall

National Association of Manufacturer*, and for the past year
a resident of Seattle, today announced the completion of 4
book which he promised would create a nation-wide sensa

Mulhall was on the witness stand for three monthf
in the summer of 1913, when the senate committee under'
took an investigation of I'rc-ident Wilson's complaint against
the "lobby."
At that time he broke with the clique in control of tits
association, ami detailed many hitherto unknown chapters
of national legislation.
Mulhall virtually "rocked the nation." Many congress
men and senators were kept on the anxious seat while h®
was on the stand.
The amazing revelations then made, according to Mnl- •
hall, are but a drop in the bucket compared with the facts
he has put into his book.
No report has ever l>een made public by the congres
sional committee named (o investigate the "insidious lobby.**
Col. Mulhall wink* a knowing eye when he mentions
this fact in proof of the hold the "lobby" still has at Wash
