News thi'ee ^eefes i^o that the Nonpartisan League is a "part
nership" and that the individual members are liable for any debt?
that may be incurred by its officers and organizers.
We challenged you to prove that. We offered you a .thousand
dollars in cash to prove your statement was not a malicious
falsehood.
You have failed to produce any proof. Instead,. after five
days have passed you merely reprint your bald assertion, WITH
OUT GIVING ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT.
•, You hunted all over-the state—your own words "indicate—
for some attorney who would "stand for" an opinion bearing out
your statement.. Evidently you COULDN'T FIND ANY AT­
TORNEY in Fargo or anywhere else—not even the highly-paid
corporation attorneys who are at your service or any "of their
many assistants in all parts of the state—to question the sound
opinions of the FIVE able arid prominent attorneys WHO HAVE
GIVEN THE LEADER SIGNED OPINIONS THAT YOUR
CLAIM IS NONSENSE AND. YOUR ASSERTION ABSO
LUTELY
*11-£ What you did do was to get some law clerk to look up for you
-certain decisions referring to the liability of MEMBERS OF
PROFIT-MAKING associations and partnerships, to which class
you and this law clerk both knew THE LEAGUE DOES NOT
BELONG- But even this law clerk WOULDN'T PERMIT HIS
NAME TO BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MISREP
RESENTATIONS YOU. INTENDED TO PRINT AND DID
1.PRINT. No what you did^was to take these citations and stir
them up with a lot of nonsensical rubbish of YOUR OWN CON­
COCTION and present the whole mass TO INSULT THE INTEL
LIGENCE OF Yt)UR READERS.
Qi But this law clerk told you, and you admitted in print, THAT
MUST PROVE THE LEAGUE TO BE AN ASSOCIA
ytTION FORMED FOR PROFIT-MAKING PURPOSES, FOR THE
PURPOSE OF CARRYING ON BUSINESS FOR THE SAKE
OF THE PROFITS, before you could show the individual mem
bers to be liable.
By maldng tiiis FATAL ADMISSION OF THE TRUTH—
-^Tlpositivdy «^aordinary ^hmg tor YOU to do dot at all in ac
ficrd with YOUR usual policy—YOU WRECKED YOUR WHOLE
^SjGASE .-^*^ '-. --. v-iV: S"
YOU CANT PROVE THAT AND YOU KNOW n* So does
ody else that read your ^argument." You say tire League
a PROFlT-ltfAKING. iussociation because it proposes TO
VE LAWS ENAC^l© WmCH WJLL SAVE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS TO ALL THE PRODUCERS OF THE STATE
OF NORTH DAKOTA. If a campaign for such laws is 'a
'PROFIT-MAKING ENTERPRISE within the meaning of the
law, so is ANY POLITICAL PLATFORM OR PROGRAM which
qalls for. LOWER TAXES or ECONOMY IN GOVERNMENT.
Come again, Reverend Doctor, that's TOO THIN ALTO-

But there's, still better stuff in your BOGUS ARGUMENT.
Before you-got through with your comical screed you admitted
that YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IT YOURSELF by trying to make
out that the LEAGUE WAS ENGAGED IN OTHER BUSINESS.

in Barnes and Bowman counties were SUB­
SCRIBING FOR STOCK IN COOPERATIVE STORES AND
BANKS. This, you tried to make it appear, would MAKE THE
LEAGUE A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.
Now aren't you ashamed of yourself, Doctor. Do you think
you are writing for an audience of imbeciles?
Just suppose that Governor Hanna and Usher L. Burdick and
one or two other Republicans OWN STOCK IN BANKS. Does
that make the REPUBLICAN PARTY A CO-PARTNERSHIP?
Would it make the REPUBLICAN PARTY A CO-PARTNER

on THAT.
Well, Doctor, we've had a lot of fun over your little joke.

Why don't you try this thing out in the courts. It Would be
a very simple matter. We would like to help you to arrange a
test, .but that would be collusion, and the courts would not re cog
mze such a case. But you have tried to create the impression
THAT THE LEAGUE HAS LARGE DEBTS Why not prX
this, too. SINCE YOUR SPIES tell you so much about League
affairs, why can't they PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH ONE OF
THESE HEAVY CREDITORS- Then YOU CAN ARRANGE
~AJAINST AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE
LEAGUE TO COLLECT THE DEBT.
