Bogalusa is going to have a
Fourth of July celebration this
year which will surpass any before
attempted, and providing the
weather man does not interfere, an
unusually fine number of amuse

Bogalusa, as a city, will be two
years old, and if the committees
work like they have promised, the
celebration will be a credit to a
city that has been established for
generations.
Nothing will be left undone or
overlooked to make the day one
long to be remembered, not only by
the visitors, but the citizens of Bo

Committees on finance, amuse

speakers were appointed, and each
commfittee is headed by a hustler

result in this being the banner cele

week the various committees will
be able to give the public an ink

occur here on that date.
