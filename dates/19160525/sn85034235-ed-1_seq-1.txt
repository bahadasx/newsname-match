CHAPTER XII.
A Friendly Chat on the Peaceful
Sabbath.
M AULEY, as president of the
Ring City Street Railway
company and as chairman of
the impromptu convention of
street car magnates, was so full of
business that he felt stuffed like a sau
sage. To his mind the fund.they had
raised to fight Allerton's iniquitous leg
islation was woefully inadequate, anil
the men who should have been most
interested were strangely optimistic.
He suggested to several of them that
they appoint a committee to see Aller
ton and arrange some sprt of compro
mise, but here again he found an unex
pected lukewarmness. Nobody seemed
to think that Allerton could be
"reached," and as a matter of fact ev
ery time he broached that subject he
fouud his fellow magnates evasive.
The newspapers need not have blazed
so much about the probable corruption
fund, because there positively was
none. The subscription secured was
only for the conduct of a publicity cam
paign and to pay for the services of a
perfectly legitimate lobbyist, who
would explain the reasonable rights of
the street car men.
On Saturday morning the visitors all
went home, looking fagged about the
eyes, without having doue much more
than pass some frothy resolutions and
raise the feeble fund referred to and
investigate by electric light whatever
the keys of the city would unlock; and
President Marley, staggering under the
burden of his position, was very much
worried.
He confided his fears to his future
son-in-law after he had seen the last
tired, hard working magnate on a train
headed for home and remorse.
"I don't think these men appreciate,
ns I do, the need of controlling street
car legislation," he complained. "Al
lerton's bill looks like a menace to all
my interests, and I am a little bit sur
prised that Sledge, since his entrance
into the game on a big scale, does not
seem more concerned about it"
"It was Sledge who arranged to have
these fellows come together." Bert re
minded him.
"Yes," admitted Marley, "but he
seçmed to have such feeble ideas about
what to do after he had them here.
It wasn't like his usual vigorous
methods."
"Then he has something up his
sleeve," decided Bert "I wish that
fellow would drop dead. I'm afraid of
him."
"You've been talking to Molly,"
laughed her father.
"No; I've been talking to Sledge,"
denied Bert. "I had just as lief have
a rattlesnake devote its life to the am
bition of sinking a fang into the calf
of my leg as to have Sledge fussing in
with me. If I can find a buyer for it
I'm going to unload my stock in that
amusement park while the public still
thinks it will be built"
Marley frowued his crushing dis
pleasure.
"You are expressing very small con
fidence in me," he reproved. "I don't
see why your nervousness about Sledge
should extend to an operation which
depends ou my judgment alone. The
Ridgewood avenue extension is to be
built as fast as it can be pushed
through. I have already ordered the
rails, the franchise cannot be disputed,
and even if Sledge were to parallel
the Ridgewood avenue line It would
only bring more patronage to your
park."
"Not mine," corrected Bert hastily.
"I'll get my money out of it as quick
as I can, and I'll, put that money'
where Sledge can't reach it"
'You're seared blue," charged Mar
ley contemptuously. "How did you
come to get tangled up with Sledge?"
"I met him down at the city hall. He
was wearing one of his fool red roses,
and I think he saw me looking at it
Perhaps I did grin. At any rate, he
stopped and asked me when I was to
be married to Molly."
"What did you tell him?"
"Christmas. Molly, yesterday after
noon, warned me not to tell any one,
and particularly Sledge, that it is to be
Thanksgiving."
"What did he say that scared you
so?"
"Nothing," confessed Bert. "He only
smiled. I felt as if I had been in a
eo'd rain."
"Same smile Molly described." Mar
ley laughed, though he was quite out
of patience. "I cannot understand
Molly's taking a whimsical fright based
on nothing, but I didn't expect it of
you, Bert I have myself found Sledge

to be rather decent In the last few
days, and I am only annoyed because
he does not seem to see the necessity
of using Lis influence with AHerton to
stop this street railway bill. I think I
shall see Allerton myself tomorrow.
He comes home every Saturday night."
Pursuant to that happy idea, the
president drove out to Allerton's house
the next morning and found the sena
tor in the luxury of pajamas, easy slip
pers and lounging robe amid an extrav
agant confusion of Sunday papers. At
his right hand was a tabaret, on which
bubbled nn electric coffee percolator,
and at his left hand was a feather
weight serving table, on which was a
comfortable supply of cigarettes. In
front of him sat Ben Sledge.
"Hello. Marley," greeted the senator.
"You're just in time for coffee."
"Had mine hours ago," returned Mar
ley, nodding his return to Sledge's
grunt
"Then it's time agaln?" insisted the
senator pleasantly, ringing for another
cup. "Or would you prefer a cocktail?"
"A little of your exclusive rye, I
think, if you insist on anything," ac
cepted Marley, drawing a chair into the
cozy little circle. "Yob're trying to
save that rye or you would have of
fered it in the first place."
"No; only trying to promote sobrie
ty," bantered Allerton. "I suppose,
however, that a memory of that good
Kentucky stock is what brought you
out hero on this peaceful Sabbath
morning."
"Hardly," denied Marley. "Frankly
I suppose I came on the same errand
as my rival and competitor here."
"What's that?" asked Allerton, with
a glance at Sledge.
To find out what the dickens you
mean by that infamous street railway
bill of which you are the disreputable
parent."
Allerton gazed at him blankly for a
moment and again glanced quizzically
at Sledge. There was a low rumble
down in Sledge's throat, but neither
his face nor his eyes betrayed any sen
timent or emotion whatsoever.
"I mean to protect the honest work
ingman, to save our houses and fire
sides and add honor and glory to the
American flag," responded Allerton sol
emnly.
Marley accepted that merry quip
with the courteous chuckle which it de
served.
"Outside of that and drying the tears
of the widows and orphans, what do
you propose to accomplish by It?" he
persisted in like vein. "If I didn't
know you were above spiteWork I
should think that yon had it In for the
street car interests."
Again the senator looked at him witb
a puzzled air, then he turned to Sledge.
"Doesn't hé know anything?* he
queried.
"Naw!" rumbled Sledge.
"I see," answered Allerton coolly. "I
supposed you all knew that before the
bill was passed it would be amended
to conserve the important financial in
terests."
Marley pondered that statement
awhile, and then he laughed.
"Of course," he said. "It's only polit
ical claptrap, Intended to make the
voter think you are eternally on the
job in his interests."
"I wouldn't put it In exactly that
way," soberly reproved Allerton, jnstly
offended by this coarse method of im
pugning his motives.
"I apologize," said Marley. "I should
have said 'the bill displays that you
constantly have the interests of your
constituents at heart.' We were rather
exercised about it. but we should not
have been, for In your long service for
the public I do not think you have ever
promoted or fostered any legislation
which would be destructive of capital."
"Certainly not," agreed Allerton, who
never let down his pose in the presence
of a man who had not proved his right
to sit within the sacred circle. "With
out the proper and legitimate fostering
of enterprises requiring extensive finan
cial support there can lie uo national
prosperity."
"That's sound enough doctrine,"
commended Marley. "What are the
amendments which are to soften the
blow?"
With kindly patience the senator ex
plained to him the amendments, one
by one, being careless enough, how
ever, not to mention the fifty year
franchise clause.
At the end of an hour Marley, much
relieved iu his mind, took his depar
ture, regretting that Sledge was not
ready to accompany him.
"It's strange how easily a man in
control of important investments takes
fright," he acknowledged, as he arose
to go. "We can be put on the run
with a penny's worth of firecrackers.
Not long ago our friend Sledge, here,
had me stampeded, but I checkmated
the old villain. As a matter of fact,
the only result of his campaign against
me was to put me in control of my
own company, and now, I fancy, 1
have the thing so well tied up that 1
can't be hurt. I beat you at your own
game, eh, Sledge?" and be chuckled
down at bis defeated oppfessor with
forgiving triumph.
Sledge looked up at him and smiled.
His thick lips parted, displaying his
teeth. The under side of his npper lip
showed a sharp roH of vivid scarlet,
and his cold gray eyes combined to
give that facial distortion an expres
sion of malignity startling even to Al
lerton, who knew the man even better
than Tom Bondix.
Marley was conscious of that strange
sensation which those who had run
foul of Sleoge had described as an
actual physical chill, like the sudden
opening of a window to the cold rain,
and the smile upon his own face froze.
He was conscious that his lips were
still in the contour which his bragging
chuckle had given them, and he felt
the emban-vsed awkwardness In re
storing Ills f- atur£s to their normal ex
pression. which a man does who bas
.ommitted some atrocious social blun
ler.
The horror and the menace and the
malignity, of that smile increased upon
hin» as be drove Into the city. In front
of the telegraph office he abruptly
stopped, and hurrying in sent this mes
sage to his up state syndicate:
Wire best offer controlling Interest.
Bert Glider, a necessary adjunct to
the Sunday dinner, came just in time
to sit down at the table with the fam
ily, and he was so preoccupied that
Molly was half vexed with him.
''Now, who has won part of your
marbles?" she chided him. attempting
to conceal her annoyance with him un
der the guise of gay raillery.
"Bert already looks like a married
man," laughed Fern. "I'd be fright
ened half to death, Molly. Think what
he'll look like at a breakfast on the
first of each month."
"He'll never see the meat bill," de
clared Molly. "I intend to begin with
alimony."
"I hope I can pay It." responded Bert,
catching the all too jovial spirit of the
assemblage and pretending to gayety
himself. "I think my first step toward
making a living, however, will be to
move out of this state where 1 can buy
and sell a piece of property without
asking permission of some alderman or
ward thug."
"I think we'll all go," suggested Mar
ley, who had been looking studiously
into his soup. "What has happened to
worry you, Bert?"
"Since Sledge smiled?" queried that
neatly mustachcd young man In order
to head him off from that reproach. "1
think I have good cause this time. 1
took a drive out Lincoln road this
morning, and they're going ahead with
their amusement park project"
"Impossible." asserted Marley,
straightening in outraged dignity,
"while the Ring City Street Railway
company has a Lincoln road franchise,
which would prevent our competitors
from obtaining one. It has not an
nounced any intention of building in
that direction and will not do so."
Bert laughed quite without mirth.
"Y'ou remind me of that good old
standard story of the mau who was
arrested for some trifling offense. He
sent for his friend and explained the
circumstances. 'Why, It's confounded
nonsense!' exclaimed the friend, hold
ing the bars and looking through the
grating of the cell door. 'No policeman
on earth can throw you into jail for
that'"
"Why, he was in jail at that very
minute," protested Fern.
"I think that's supposed to be the
point of the story," guessed Molly. "Of
what is It apropos, Bert?"
"Of the impossibility of building an
amusement park on Lincoln road," he
answered. "They're digging a lake out
there. They've erected the scaffolding
of a roller coaster. They've built a big
workshed, which is later to be turned
into a Tanuenbnum hall, which just
now is stacked with gaudy parts of a
three story merry-go-rouncL It may be
utterly impossible for them to build nn
amusement park out there, but they're
doing it."
Molly glanced quickly at her father.
He motioned that his untouched soup
might be taken away and toyed in ner
vons embarrassment with an almond.
"I've already done it," he half shame
facedly explained.
"Sold your stock?" she eagerly in
quired.
"Not quite," he hesitated. "I did.
however, stop at the telegraph office on
my way back from Allerton's this
morning, and I wired the people who
have been after my stock to name their
best offer." „
"Good!" she responded. "Will you
take it, whatever it is?"
"I can't bind myself to that," he re
plied. "I must confess, however, that,
whatever the offer is, 1 shall bo
tempted."
"Allerton must have given you very
little satisfaction-about that bill," sur
mised Bert.
"Quite the contrary." stated Marley.
"The bill is absolutely harmless. It is
only a bit of political flapdoodle, in
tended to convince the voters of the
state that Allerton is constantly on the
job."
"Something must have happened to
make you change your mind so quick
ly," pondered Molly. "Whatever it was
I'm glad of it. You must have met
Sledge," and she giggled.
"Sledge must have smiled at him,'
laughed Bert, keeping up the joke.
"I have excellent reasons," Marley
concluded, with becoming business
gravity. "The future of street railway
investment in this city is too uncer
tain."
"Father," said Molly suddenly in the
midst of the silence which followed,
"if Mr. Sledge finds you have sent that
telegram .he will do whatever he is go
ing to do before you can turn around."
"He'll have to move quickly," an
swered her father with a superior
smile, his self approbation returning on
the slightest provocation. "I sent my
people that telegram today so they
would have it the first thing Monday
morning. They were very eager while
they were here to acquire possession,
and I shall doubtless hear from them
by 10 o'clock."
"I wish i could sleep until 10 and
when I wake up find that it's all right,'
Molly worried. "If you and Bert are
not entirely out of all business deals in
this towii by our wedding day Sledge
will see to it. if be has to move Leaven
and earth to accomplish It. that we
none of us have a dollar, and by that I
mean absolute pauperism in the best
and most thorougly melodramatic
sense."
"He has the most absurd way of
making love." commented Fern. "It'<
like the old cave dweller plan of kill
ing off the family, batting the fair maid
In the bead with a club and letting her
wako up in her new home."
"Not Sledge, ne does his lovemak
•ng with red roses," laughed Molly,
tons and tons of them. This is a dif
ferent proposition. He has reduced ev
erything in life to dollars and cents,
and he thinks that if he can only break
Bert and father there'll be no wedding
bells for us. Bert and I will each be
compelled to seek n more lucrative
match."
She glanced smilingly at Bert and
surprised on his face a curious expres
sion, which plunged her into deep and
not overly pleasant thought
"He'd have bluffed me long ago,"
confessed Fern. "I'd have been so
scared to death that by this time I'tl be
sending out afternoon tea invitations
on his business stationery."
"You spiritless wretch!" chided
Molly.
"It might not be so bad, after all,"
returned Fern, persisting, now that
she had started, in revealing the en
tire depth of her depravity. "I sup
pose I ought to be ashamed to ac
knowledge it, but I like Sledge."
"You may pack up your things and
go home," laughed Molly, not really
blaming her for the sentiment, how
ever. "Yon're positively hopeless.
Fern."
"All right," insisted Fern. "1 don't
think there'd be any more fun than
taming and managing a big brute like
him."
"Throw her out," begged Bert "She's
dangerous!"
CHAPTER XIII.
Molly's Anxiety Well Founded.
M OLLY'S anxiety was by no
means feigned, for the next
morning, at 10 o'clock, she
called up her father at his of
fice and asked him if he had received
an answer to his telegram. In rather
a worried tone he replied that he had
not, but that he would let her know
as soon as he had done so.
She wandered about the house, quite
ill at ease; then, unable to content her
self, suggested to Fern that they make
ready for a drive. When they were
ready she hesitated a moment or two
in front of the telephone, but conquered
that temptation. Instead, she made
their first stop at her father's office,
and, with a curious degree of consider
ation, waited in the little red reception
room to be announced. She was told
to come right in, and found Bert with
her father.
Marley silently handed her a tele
gram. It read:
Our Mr. Coldman will see you In two
weeks from today.
"Two weeks," she worried. "Can't
you possibly hurry them up?"
Marley handed ber another telegram:
Impossible to arrange earlier »ate.
"Hunt's resignation was in my mall
this morning," stated Marley, with
forced quietness. "He has taken a
position as secretary with Sledge's
company, and I suppose half my office
force will follow him."
"Two weeks," speculated Bert, then
he added impatiently: "Confound it,
Marley! I'm in a pretty pickle if we
can't clear our skirts of this thing!
I borrowed the money to bny up Mood
son's stock from some friends of mine,
and on my unsupported note. To lose
would mean the absolute end of my
social standing, here or anywhere."
'We'll see that you get yours first,"
offered Marley, whose respect for his
son-in-law to be was only superficial.
'I didn't mean to urge my personal

claims above yours," Bert hedged, his
impatience, however, only slightly
modified. "The fundamental fact Is
that we must gain time."
'I don't s«« how unless Molly mar
ries Sledge." suggested her father, with
a laugh.
Molly started to laugh alsa but found
Bert looking at her speculanvely.
"She doesn't need go that far," he
mused.
Molly looked at him in sharp incredn
lity for a moment; then, without a
word, she turned to leave the room.
"Where are you going?" asked her
father.
"To see Sledge," she responded. "1
think you told me that he is always at
the bank between 11 and 12 in tfie
morning."
"Molly," commanded Bert sharply,
recalled to his senses by ber bearing,
"you mustn't see hlm. I forbid it."
"I am taking your advice, but I re
fuse to take your orders," she calmly
informed him, surprised to find in her
self an Inclination to giggle over her
use of that splendidly ringing remark.
"Molly will shield you from all harm,"
she added, and she was snickering
when she rejoined Fern.
"What's the joke?" asked that young
lady. "I've been dying all morning to
hear somebody giggle."
"You're to chaperon me while I go
over and make love to Sledge," Molly
gayly informed her.
"You're not really," protested Fern.
"I am really," retorted Molly, her
eyes flashing a trifle more than a mere
jest would seem to warrant "I must.
Fern. I plunged both father and Bert
into this trouble, and Bert seems to
think It's up to yours truly Molly to
fool Sledge along until they have time
to get out of it Besides that. It's a
sort of a game between Sledge and my
self, and I'm not going to have that big
duffer win it."
"This is too delightful for anything,"
applauded Fern. "I'm perfectly mad
about it, Molly. I hope Sledge is in."
Sledge was in. He was closeted with
Senator Allerton and Governor Waver
on n most important conference, one
involving the welfare and prosperity of
half the voters in the state; but, nev
ertheless. he promptly stifled his con
science and allowed the interests of the
sovereign people to suffer when Davis
whispered in his ear that Molly Marley
wanted to see him.
"Bring her right in," said Sledge.
'Men, you'll have to go. It's a lady,**
and he opened the rear door for them.
'Just one moment," parleyed Gov
ernor Waver, his hand on the door
knob. "I'm returning to the capital this
afternoon, and"—
I'll see you up there," interrupted
Sledge, pushing the door and the gov
ernor with it
By the way, my coat," called the
senator from the rear corridor.
The knob of the other door rattled.
"All right," grunted Sledge, closing
them ont in the draft just as Molly and
Fern came hi. "ncllo, girls!" said
Sledge. "Sit down. Excuse me a min
ute till I poke a guy's Benny out to
him." ________
