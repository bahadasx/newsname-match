Our Just Due
It has been the custom of the
newspapers, not only in Monroe
City, but of surrounding towns to
ignore the graduating exercises
when the class has first ignored
the papers by not giving them a
chance to quote prices on the class
invitations.
Soon after the present editor
took charge of the N ews, she came
to us with the information that the
class of 1916, of the public school,
had ordered invitations elsewhere.
and asked that we print nothing
about the commencement ex
ercises, as she intended to ignore
them. As this had always been
customary we ugreed to her propo
sition. That this was not held against
the class is proven by the publicity
wr have given the class plays, part
ies, etc, in the columns of our
lap-r.
For reasons best known to her
self the eilitor of the News decided
not to fulfill the terms of her own
proposition and informed us the
morning after the Baccalaurette
service that she intended to give it
a writeup in Tuesday's paper.
We told her it was purely a mut
ter of principle with us and she
agreed that it was the proper thing
for us to ignore it but said she
could not afford to do it.
We did not make this statement
in last weeks Democrat for we felt
that her action entitled her to
everything she could make out of
the deal, but we did ask her to ex
plain our position in the matter, in
her Friday issue and told her if she
would do this, we would say noth
ing about it. As she refused to do
this, we feel that it is due to our
selves to explain our action to the
public school class of 1916.
Just received a fine line of
spoons for the graduates.

John Henry McClintic was born
in Rockbridge County, Virginia
Sept 11. 1847, He moved with
his father's family to Msisiuri in
18G8 ana engaged immediately in
farming and cattle raising and
shortly after became one of the
earliest live stock buyers and
shippers in this section of the
country, being well known in stock
yards of Chicago, Kansas City
Omaha and East St. Louis.
In October 1875 he was married
to Maria May. eldest daughter of
Dr. George C Jones. For seventeen
years they lived on his farm in
Marion County, four miles west of
this city. In 1892 he removed to
town where he has since resided.
Mr. McClintic was 14 years old
when the war broke out and two
years later lie and his neighbor
playmate, Win Barger. ran away
to join the Southern army, then in
the valley of Virginia. At first
they were refused because of their
youth but they were so persistent
that they were accepted and Mr.
McClintic was sent to Gen Wick
ham's heudpuarters. He was a
member of the First Va Cavalry
and was one of General Wickham's
couriers. He was in many engage
ments in the latter part of the war.
At Mount Jackson he carried the
colors, snatching them up from
the hand of the dying color bearer.
In the last Skirmish he was deliver
ing despatches when the order
came to charge he immediately
rushed in with the Fourth Reginuwt
altho he belonged to the First, and
here he received his first wound
being shot through the right urin.
He was removed to the hospital in
Richmond and the following day,
rather than be captured, he rode in
an ox cart and walked twenty
miles to reach his home in Ruck
rid ge.
Mr. McClintic's last indisposition
was only ten days duration and
was not considered seiious The
end came suddenly and peacefully
His funeral, which was one of the
largest ever held in (own was from
St. Jude's churcn which was filled
to the door. Many were unable to
obtain entrance. The Masons at
tended in a body and took charge
of the interment, usisg the beautiful
ritual of the Masonic Order.
His friends could not be numbered
and cunie from all points, Chicago,
Kansas City. Quinsy, St. Louis and
nearby places.
To mourn his irreparable loss he
leaves a wife and one daughter, two
brothers and two sisters.
