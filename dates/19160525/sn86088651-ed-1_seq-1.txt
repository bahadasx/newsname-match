SPEAK AT ST. ANDREW'S.
Mr. A. W. Wilkerson, vice presi
dent of the Brazos River and Valley
Improvement Association, had a tele
phone" communication from Mr. J. O.
Chance this morning, who Is with the
congressional flood control com
mittee . In South Texas. The com
mittee has materially changed their
Itinerary as originally announced, the
object of the change being to give
the committee more time for investi
gation in the overflow district, and
sot bo much time for entertainment
In the town. The change will elimi
nate the Saturday program altogether,
and jet nojerrltory will be neglected
because of the time saved In not visit
ing the towns.
The program as to this territory
is as follows: The committee will
spend tonight in Caldwell Instead of
In Brenham and tomorrow morning at
7:30 they will come over the Gld
dings cut-off to lnterwban Junction,
Just across the Brazos River from
Stone City. Manager Levlnson. upon
telegraphic advices from Mr. Chance,
will have one of hla motor cars at
Interurban Junction and the party will
be taken down the bottom through
the levee district to the Chance farm.
They will be shown the entire section
of the bottom together with a number
of picture taken during the high
flood during the past few years.
This will be the best and most con
vincing proof that federal aid is need
ed to help control the waters of the
stream, that could possibly be pro
duced. Returning to Interurban Junction,
the committee will go by the Glddlngs
cut-off to Hearne and from there on
to Waco. They will not come Into
Bryan at all. Mr. A. W. Wilkerson
will Join the party at Interurban
