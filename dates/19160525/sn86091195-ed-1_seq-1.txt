RIVERSIDE GIRL'S
DEATH RECALLED
In the ease of Jesse Gesas, charged
with involuntary manslaughter, as a
result of the death of Edward Davis,
November 1:1, 1915, from being run
down by an automobile which Gesas
was driving, trial was begun Tuesday
morning before Judge C. W. 51 or sc of
the Third District court.
A jur 3 ' was obtained and three state's
witnesses were examined before ad
journment at 5 o'clock.
In the information tiled against
Gesas, it is alleged that he was driving
a car at a high rate of speed, past a
Street car that hud stopped at the inter
section of Fifth East and Seventh
South streets,, when his car struck and
killed Edward Davis and fatally in
jured his fiancee, Miss Gladys MitcheP,
an instant after the two had alighted
from the street car.
Davis was picked up dead ami the
young woman was taken to the emer
gency hospital at police headquarters,
where she died without regaining con
sciousness. The two were to have been
married the day following the accident.
Mrs. L. Shields and H. B. Sprague
and Undertaker E. M. tenait rough testi
fied on the stand Tuesday as to the na
ture of the injuries sustained by the
victims of the accident. In his opening
statement to the jury, E. O. Leather
wood, district attorney, explained that
the damage sustained bv the front of
the car from the impact of the bodies
of the victims would be submitted to
the consideration of the jury as evi
dence that the automobile was travel
ing beyond the speed limit at the time
they were struck.
It. is understood that the defense will
contend that the automobile was not
being driven beyond a reasonable rate
of speed when the young man and the.
young woman were struck, and that it
did not pass the street car while the
street car was standing. At the time of
the adjournment last evening, half a
score of witnesses, who have been sub
poenead for the trial, were called before
the court und sworn. They were warned
not to enter the" court room during the
progress of the trial until called and
not to confer among themselves or with
anvone as to the nature of their testi

VAST DIFFERENCE IN
PRICE OP PAYING
The eitv of Blackfoot opened bids for
the paving of a number of blocks of the
business district. A remarkable feat
ure of the bids was the vast difference
between the bids on bitulithic paving
and the price paid for the same stand
ard laid here some time ago. The price
paid at Idaho Falls was *2-15, while the
bid at Blackfoot was $1.73. Had Ida
ho Falls received the same figures on
the lacol paving, the difference would
have approximated $20,000. Black
toot's paving was let on competitive
bids.—Idaho Falls Post.

DUBOIS SUBMITS TO
THBOAT OPERATION
Fred T. Dubois, former United States
Srtnator from Idaho, underwent a seri
ous operation to his throat at Koe li
est er, Mina-, Thursday. Worit was re
eeived by his daughter that the oper
ation was a success aim the , fcguces for
his reeovery are good. Mrs. Dubois is
with her husband.
Dr. Dubois, a brother of the former
senator, died a few years ago from what
is believed to have been a similar ail
ment.
How Soon We Are to Forget.
This is probably the first time in a
.year or so that the name of Dubois
lias been in the paper, but there was
a time when his name was in every is
sue of every paper in the State.
Idaho owes to Dubois probably more
thnu to any other living man its exist
ence among the sisterhood of states.
He planned our fight for statehood,
and as a mere delegate to Congress he
was our man on the firing line. With
out even the power of a vote or a trade
in the House of Representatives, he car
ried through our admission bill.
Dubois has been in his day a politi
cal leader in both the Republiean and
Dcmoeiratie parties, for he joined the re
volt from his old party and espoused
the eause of the Democrats when Bryan
and free silver were the biggest issues
of the day.
As a ]iolitienl leader it will probably
not be denied that lie bail no peer in
the State in 'expert, practieal knowl
edge of the game, and certainly he has
had no peer when it comes to the mat
ter of announcing mid carrying to ful
filment his plans of campaign.
Dubois lias had courage and honesty.
In his methods there was nothing of the
pussy-foot or hush-button politician.
Mouths in advance lie would announce
his plans. He was always honest and
above board in his dealings, mid he al
ways made good his promises. In of
fice lie was always a faithful servant,
and never was oldiged to proclaim his
honesty. It was never even doubted.
Through out his long public career In
lias remained a poor mail, though his
term in Washington included the halcy
on days when senators and congressmen
by fair means and foul piled up im
mense personal fortunes. While his as
sociates were living on the fat and oil
of the land, Dubois endured bravely the
misery of genteel poverty, though he
knew to a certainty that the opportun
ity for vast loot was constantly waiting
at his door.
The Statesman lias been opposed to
Dubois politically for many .years, but
in common with those, who remember
and appreciate his services to Idaho has
hail an admiration and affectionate
esteem for his many sterling qualities.
The Statesman joins them in hoping
for a quick convalescence and many
more years of useful residence amongst
us.—Boise Statesman.
JOY-RIDERS CAPSIZED.
Last Saturday morning about 11
o'clock several girly joy-riders had a
narrow escape from serious bodily in
juries. Miss Genevieve Rich was on the
wheel, and Miss Winnie Bietliaii .was
supplying the speed, which unaccount
able to the young ladies became so fast
that they lost their wits and could not
stop the ear, which they attempted to
i turn. Owing to the quick ami rapid
turn, the car was capsized and its fair
occupants were scattered on the ground.
I The other joy-riders were Misses Edna
Capps and Ora Rogers. The car be
longed to D. II. Bietlinn, and was consid
! erably damaged. The young ladies mi
raculously escaped serious injury.
FAREWELL PARTY.
The ladies of the P. E. O. Sister
hood gave a farewell party to Mrs.
Clins. L. Hurt and Miss Agnes Hart,
her daughter, at the residence of Mr.
and Mrs. J. G. Brown last Saturday
afternoon. Auction bridge was enjoyed
in the early hours of the afternoon,
after which delicious refreshments were
served. Only members of the Sister
hood were present.
The afternoon was spent in guessing
games and conversation. Among those
present were Mrs. D'Orr Povntei, Mrs.
!>. I). Neelan, Mrs. Neil F. Boyle, Mrs.
H. C. Hoover, Miss Kate Brady and
Mrs. W. E. Patrie. A dainty lunch was
served, after which the guests departed
for their homes.
CROWDED SCHOOL.
The crowded condition of the Central
school building is causing the school
directors some worry. There is no
money iu the school fund for building
purposes, and some of the school board
are in favor of utilizing the obi tin
school building of by-gone days. Oth
ers. including Directors J. (J. Brown
and Early, are in favor of a new build
ing in place of the old one. which they
: contend is a menace to the scholars and
an eyesore to the school grounds.

Chautauqua Days
Are Drawing Nigh
Blackfoot Chautauqua Will Open
June 17 and Close June 23.
If the number of season tickets sold
is any indication of the prooable success
of the Chautauqua, we can rest assured
that real "crowds" will lie present at
every session of the week 's entertain
ment.
Last spring someone said that enough
season tickets could not bo sold to bring
the Chautauqua to our city, but, the
men and women who are selling these
tickets are fast dispelling this idea
from the minds of the doubters. For j
season tickets are going fast—there is |
no doubt but that enough season tickets ;
will be sold to meet the guarantee to j
the chautauqua company if everyone I
just takes a pencil and a piece of paper |
and figures what a saving a season tick
et is to the holder.
Chautauqua opens in just a few days.
Most people who like the best in enter- i
tainment, music and lectures just look i
forward to the day of arrival of the big i
brown tent, for that means a week off
splendid features and entertainment.
Every day is a day of features, and i
whether you are a season ticket holder
or just the man that pays each time ;
you enter, you will do well to attend I
every program, with the following at
tractive features:
The Kaffir Boys.
If you can viziinlixe one of the nmst
imaginative, romantic and spell-weav
ing chapters of "Treasure Island" or
"Robinson Crusoe,'' animated in act
ual life before yon, pulsating with all
the weird mystery, charm and enchant
ment of an almost unknown region of
the Dark Continent, you can get just
a suggestion of Baliner 's Wonderful
Singing Kaflir Bovs, positively the most
unique, and by all odds tlie biggest sin
gle chautauqua feature attraction tour
ing the country. They have appeared
before more than two million people,
in over three thousand cities, towns and
chautaiiquas of Great Britain, France,
Canada and the United States, receiv
ing tremendous ovations everywhere.
At Chautauqua, New York, they divided
honors with ex-Presidont Theodore
Roosevelt in drawing the greatest audi
ences of the summer.
The Kaffirs are a vivid study in at
mosphere realism. Costumed in all the
motley glamor, bespangled brilliance of
native regalia, they project a living
page from the tribal life, customs and
traditions of the African jungles. They
give tribal ceremonies with the accom
panying melodious chant of native mu
sic, and their war dance is done with
such enthusiasm, such abandoned ecsta
sy that they never fail to create a cor
responding degree of excitement among
their hearers.
The intrinsic quality of the Kaffir
Boys wonderful singing is a marvelous
natural quality of voice and resonant
intonation—a clarity of word tone,
and enunciation rarely found among
singers. It was this fresh, bell-like
clearness of tlieii* voices that especially
JUDGES EXCHANGE BENCHES.
Idaho Falls Post: Judge Fred Cowan,
district judge of the Sixth judicial 'lis
trict, will preside in this court during
the remainder of the term, while Judge
Gwiun, accompanied by his reporter,
Clarence Dietrich, will go to Salmon
City, in Lemhi county, ami hold court
for Judge Cowan. Judge Cowan, who
has recently been elected to the bench,
formerly practiced law iu Salmon City
and a number of cases in which he ap
peared as attorney, will he tried at this
term of the court in Lemhi county.
Owing to this disqualification of Judge
Cowan, Judge Gwinn was requested to
exchange benches with the Sixth dis
trict judge.
George Holbrook is now a resident of
Eureka, California, where he has a
brother, |
appealed to Mr. Buhner during his trav
els through Africa. Recognizing tin
possibilities of proper training, lie de
voted his time in perfecting the Kaffir
Roy t'hoir. They sing solos, duets,
trios, quartets, part songs and choruses,
Mr. Bahner singing linse. Miss Clark nv
I-IMII 1 um ist . singing contralto, the boys
singing alto, soprano and baritone,
making an exceptionally well balanced
ensemble. These boys can and do sing
in the language of the several tribes
which they represent, but most of their
selections ,Àre rendered in good under
sGbidulnhä l-jngjisli, every syllable ilis
tinet.
Appropriately interwoven with the
songs, ceremonies and pantomimes are
brief fascinating stories of the wild
jungle life, tales of witchcraft, where
the boys were found, their history, how
obtained, and a lot of other information
of vital interest by Mr. Rainier and
Miss Clark.
The Kaffir Buys are famous the world
over for their peculiar grace and feline
agility of movement, the sparkle of
their dancing eves and the spontaneous
radiance of their smiles. There are
other big things at the ehaiitauqua—
it is a great program—but the Knllii
Bov Choir, with fresh laurels won lie
fore the royalty and dignitaries of Eu
rope, the phenomenal sureess attending
their appearance throughout extended
eastern itineraries, is unmistakably the
most pretentious ehaiitauqua offering
ever presented in the west.
fikiblnsky, the Russian Violinist.
The story of Alexander von Skibin
sky, the young Russian violinist, who
will give two concerts at the ehuutnu
qiin this yenr, is one which brings out
the indomitable spirit and determina
tion of the young rnlicertiueistor.
Skibiuskv formerly resided in Mos
cow and was helping celebrate one of
the Russian national holidays. The pre
mature explosian of a giant firecracker
shattered his left liants, the hand he
used in fingering his famous Strudivnr
ins violin. The first finger was taken
off entirely and two others were almost
paralyzed. But young Skibiuskv re
fused to take the rebuff as defeat. He
ordered a wooden finger made for the
one he lost. After years of tedious
practice, he again mastered the rudi
ments of lingering. His music seemed
greater than ever.
The newspapers had spread the re
port throughout Rusxta that Skibiuskv
would never appear before the inusie
lovers of the empire again. When Ski
binskv did appear in concert the sur
prised and pleased hearers received him
with great ovations. Skibiuskv was in
greater favor than ever before.
During the war in Uurope, Skibiuskv
came to America, and has appeared in
over thirty eastern cities. Much inter
est is being shown over his appearance
at the chautauqua here, and a record
audience is expected at the chautauqua
tent when he plays in concert.

At the request of Bishop Buchanan,
we correct the. statement that card play
ing was indulged in last week at a par
ty given by Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Webb.
The bishop indignantly denies tlie as
sertion on the ground that the Mormon
church lias an inexorable ban on card
placing, and savs that no good Morninn
will tolerate the practice.
D. L. Wilson, of Riverside, who was
arrested several weeks ago for making
and selling cider with more than a beer
kick in it. pleaded not guilty and was
bound over to the district court on liis
own recognizance.
