Rev. Frank Lewis Hardy, pastor of
the First Baptist church of Hender
son, '.""delivered the baccalaureate ad
dressbefore the graduating class of
Bethel Woman's College Tuesday
evening. Dr. Hardy was still suffer
ing from a sprained knee, the result
of an accident at the Southern Baptist
Convention at Asheville, that made it
necessary for him to stop over at a
Nashville hospital for a few days. He
said only his great interest in the
cause of female education induced
him to fill his engagement, suffering
as he was from physical disabilities.
His address was a learned discus
sion of the subject from several dif
ferent standpoints, closing with a
fervent tribute to religious training
such as is imparted in the noble insti
tution now more than 60 years of age.
Eight young ladies received the de
gree of A. B., four graduated from
the High School department and four
in music, voice and expression.
The highest class honors werewon
by Miss Mary Louise Tahdy, of Elk
ton, who won' the same "distinction as
a junior last year. She was present
ed with a gold medal, the presenta
tion being made by Chas. M. Mcach
am. tier valedictory address was
read at the close of the exercises.
Miss Edna Douglass, of Illinois,
won second nonors. bne was pre
sented with the honor medal by
Bailey Waller and was salutatorian of
the class.
A special medal for proficiency was
awarded to Miss Maud Adams.
The diplomas were conferred by
Rev. C. M. Thompson, President of
the Board of Trustees.
President W. S. Peterson in closing
announced that there would be a re
ception at the College and a large
number of young people attended
this delightful event.
Practically all of the teachers and
! pupils left for their homes yesterday.
The Alumnqe Association held a
reunion on the campus Tuesday, serv
ing a luncheon at noon.
A speaking program followed, the
principal address being delivered by
Mr. Geo. E. Gary, which is published
herewith:
LADIES OF THE ALUMNAE ASSO
CIATION OF BETHEL WO
MAN'S COLLEGE.
I was requested by your Committee
to submit argument showing why the
Baptist Board of Education should
come to the aid of this venerated in
stitution. I might say, "Gentlemen of the
Board, wo Western Kentuckians,
transplanted as wo afo for the most
part from the same states, Virginia
and tho Carolinas, aro a homogeneous
people, bound by ties of heredity,
not only to each other but to this dear
old College, which is a witness to
that homogeneity, one of its aids and
abettors, and whose decadenco and
removal would deprive us of a land
mark of the kind that enriches com
munity life, a connecting link with
tho education of a generation or more
But the Board might say that this
plea is vague.abstract and sentimental.
Or wo might argue thuswiso:
''Gentlemen, you. should come to
the aid of an instituion that is among
the most honorable in the land; that
hag stood for more than half a cen
tury for all that is best and finest in
tho education, character-training and
christian development of tho young
maidenhood of Kentucky; that nas
made of our mothers, our sisters, our
wives, and is making of our daugh-

BALD-HEAD
CLUBJEETS
Assembled in Library Build
ing By Invitation of
Col. Smith.
MANY TOPICS DISCUSSED
One of Col. Clarence Blake-
more's Cartoons Almost
Causes Serious Trouble.
There was an air of suppressed ex
citement as one by one the members
of the Bald-headed Club strolled in
and took their seats.
In calling the meeting to order,
Col. Green Champlin said it was held
in the assembly room of the Carnegie
Library upon the invitation of Col.
Ira L. Smith, who occupies a shining
place as a library commissioner, a
bank director, a Methodist steward
and a charter member of the Bald-
headed Club. Col. Smith is a bald
headed man after the Prophet Elijah's
own heart, he added. This compli
ment caused a flush of pardonable
pride to color Col. Smith's face and
spread upward until it disappeared in
the hirsute lambrequin near his back
collar button. Even a modest man
sometimes likes a reasonable amount
of obituary talk before he dies. "Col.
Smith being this kind of a man," Col.
Champlin went on, "the invitation
was extended and accepted in the
spirit in which it was given."
"What's that he said about spirits"
remarked Col. Iko Hart, sorter voicey,
pricking up his ears to catch the loca
tion of the spirits.
"Shut up, Ike. It's another kind
he's talking about, " remarked Col.
Bob Wooldridge, who sometimes ap
points himself official censor for talk
ative members.
Just at this juncture, Col. Clarence
Blakemore came in with the informa
tion that news had just been received
that the war in Europe was still going
on and that Villa had not yet been
caught This news created a pro
found sensation.
Col. Bill Howell said the report that
the war had been brought to a close
grew out of the fact that England had
won a big victory over the Irish who
had seized Dublin and had wired the
Dutch to hold Holland. Col. Howell
said the British were busy shooting
the prisoners they had captured until

iHARMONIOUS
GATHERING
Of Kentucky Democrats at
Lexington Held Yes
terday. GOV. STANLEY CHAIRMAN
But One Slight Discordant
Note in Stanley-James
Harmony Program.
Lexington, Ky., May 24. Lexing
ton is crowded to-day with the dele
gates to the democratic state conven
tion which meets here to perfect the
party organization and select dele
gates to the national convention.
Senator Ollie James, former Lieut.
Governor E. J. McDermott and Gen.
W. B. Halderman who probably will
be national committeeman, arrived
last night with the Louisville delega
tion, Senator J. C. W. Beckham
came in the afternoon.
Tom Rhea, an anti-administration
democrat, arrived with the Logan
county delegates, who comprise the
only unit not favorable to the Stanley
James harmony program. General
Percy Haly, also classed as opposed
to the program, is here.
A rumor is in circulation that a
movement is on foot to return to the
old system of appointing county com
mittees by the state committee and to
reduce the number of state committee
membrrs by one-half. The i4ea is to
have a more wieldly body. State
Chairman Hager, Eli Brown of Frank
fort, and others "on the inside"
scouted the idea. There seems to be
some doubt as to whether Senator
Beckham will be made a delegate-at-
large, since he has declared for send
ing non-office holders to St. Louis,
The convention was temporarily
organized at noon by the election of
Gov. A. O. Stanley as chairman and
the appointment of the usual commit
tees to report at a later session.
Gov. Stanley delivered a ringing
speecli that aroused the greatest en
thusiasm. Attorney General M. M. Logan is
to be permanent chairman of the con
vention.
The district conventions wore held
to-day and delegates, electors and
committeemen from each district
chosen. The convention will elect
Gov. Stanley and Senator James as
two of the delegates from the State at
large. Senator Beckham can be one
if he wants the honor. Former Sen
ator Camden and Mayor Buschemey-
er, of Louisville, are prominently
mentioned.
The resolutions strongly endorsed
the national and state administrations
and the delegates were instructed for
Wilson.

CONFLICT IS MURDEROUS
Anniversary of Italy's En
trance to Conflict Finds
Armies on the Defensive.
London, May 24. The Germans.
have replied to the terrific French of'
fensive in the Douaumont region with
assault after assault, and tho deadly
combat northeast and northwest of
Verdun is still in progress. Heavy;
masses of German troops have Been:
thrown against the picked French
troops whose successful attacks won.
for them the greater portion of Fori
Dououmont and considerable ground
adjacent to the fort of high strategic
value.
These newly captured positions tho?
French have tenaciously held. Partic
ular mention is made by the French
war office of maintenance of the posi
tion to Fort Douaumont conquered by
the French Monday. The fighting at
this point is characterized by Paris a
"murderous struggle," each attack
was preceded by powerful artillery
preparation. Although they were held to the
northeast, the Germans would not be
denied at Le Mort Homme and, after
having been mowed down by the
French artillery and machine guns
with sanguinary losses in several at
tacks, they gained a footing in the
trenches to the west of this much
sought-for position. Their (enure of
the trenches was short lived, howevr
er, for the French in a counter at
tack immediately drove them out.
ITALY ON DEFENSIVE.
Italy's first anniversary of her entry
into the war found her troops on at
least one sector in southern Tyrol
forced back by the Austrian offensive
upon Italian soil and in general retire
ment to their main line of defense
from the region south of Reverto to
the Val Sugana, southwest of Trent.
While along the Russian front the
unusual bombardments have continu
ed almost exclusively in the Pripct
river region, the Russians in an in
fantry attack drove the Germans
across the Voseluhu river and de
stroyed their trenches.
In the coast region of Asiatic Tur
key, southwest af Trebizond, the Rus
sians have repulsed attempts by the
Turks to assume tho offensive. In
their advance on Mosul, with Mesopo
tamia their objective, the Russians
have occupied Serbecht.
The British house of commons has
passed unanimously a vote of credit
amounting to about $1,500,000,000.
The total credits obtained by Great
Britian since the war began are thus,
raised to aboutll.OlO.OOO.OOO.
