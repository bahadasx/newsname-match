Hound Iron ti Hteel Works,
whs placed luuHi on the
burner of the St. I'iiiil 4k Ta

president of the destroyed
works'.
He esiin ■ii led the actual loss at
I*oo,lloo, although he declared
that tlie great store of patterns,
representing the uccuniiihition of
28 years, could not he replaced
for less than a million dollar*.
It was the largest fire which
lias occurred on the tideflats In
recent years.
Three large frame buildings In
which the patterns were made
and stored, were completely de
•troyed. Five minutes after the
alarm was given, shortly after 10
o'clock, the three buildings were
a mass of flames.
Menaces Lumber Yards.
The most the fire department
could do when It arrived on the
scene waa to confine the flames
to the pattern works and keep
them from spreading to the lum
ber yards of the St. Paul £ Ta
coma Lumber Co.
A sudden change of wind might
have caused the destruction of
the entire lumber plant.
Homing fiercely, the three dry
frame structures went up like a
furnace. Almost as quickly as it
•tarted. the fire burned Itself out
and was under control before 11
o'clock.
% Had Happened Hel'oi c.
"Sparks from the lumber com
pany's burner have threatened
our plant nearly every day," de
clared President Roberts.
"We have to be constantly on
the lookout for danger. Some
times in one day we have had to
put out as many us six smtll lire*
which have been caused by sparkl
from the burner."
He would not say whether he
will take any action against the
St. Paul ft Tacoma Lumber Co.
for damages.
Insured at 10 Per Cent.
The plant was insured for only
10 per cent of the estimated
value.
Two huge tanks of creosote,
part of the new plle-creosotlng
plant of the 3t. Paul mill, were
within 50 feet, of tho pattern
shop.
At the start of the fire, it seem
ed certain that the creosote plant
was doomed, and a small pauic
ensued when it was reported that
the tanks were In danger of ex
ploding.
Heroic employes of the mill
company hauled fire hose to the
top of the tanks, and kept them
cool with running water through
out the fire.
Seven companies of fire appar
atus responded to the alarm.
There were six lines of private
hose from the mill and Iron com
panies, besides 22 lines of hose
from fire engines and the fire
hoat.
Water Supt. Paul Havidge
said today that he had Issued
an order this morning cut
ting off water from the tide
flats district, in order to
make needed repairs, but
had canceled the order an
hour before the fire, decid
ing to do the work at night.
Had the water shut-off or
der gone through, firemen
would have beeu utterly
helpless to combat wHh the
flame..

Stayed Out Nights
When Frances wanted to go to
a dance, there was no objection.
If Frances stayed out all night,
few questions were asked.
There was a general laxnesa in
the mother's management of the
daughter, Roblson stated.
He blamed Mrs. Hodge for her
daughter's downfull, and the
mother faced a charge in court
yesterday of contributing to the
delinquency of a minor.
Attorney A. C. Allen, employed
by Mrs. Hodge, argued loudly for
his client's freedom.
"Blame the men," he nrgued.
"Blame the dance hall owner.
Blame the city for allowing danc

City to Guarantee Purity of Milk
ALL 10 BE HANDLED
IN A CENTRAL PLANT
BY E. A. PETERS
Imagine, if you can, a city where every boMtc of milk is
given a flat guarantee uf purity by a GOTpt of tlie best medical
officials to be obtained 1
A community where infantile tubercnlofit, spinal menin
gitis, infantile paralysis, and all the other diseases of babies
and children caused principally from ini|Mirities in milk, are
unknown!
A city where one may raise his baby oil bottled milk secure
in the knowledge that every drop ha- been tested and certified
by doctors of the highest rank!
// sounds tike a I'topian dream. Bui il im't so much a
rlr>'am as a prophesy of the future conditions in Tacoma. J lit
near future, at that.
It is the entt> sought by the medical profession of this city.
And if brains and ingenuity -ihean anything, the plan will ma
terialize before the city fairly awakens to the idea.
Proposes to Establish Milk Clearing House
Dr. E. A. Rich, head of th^-city's new health board, is father
of the plan. The physicians all are with him.
The dairymen, after a few- argument* in which they were
given an outline of the plan by which Tacoma would receive
an ABSOLUTELY PURE milk supply, b-Vt fallen in line.
The city council is ready to back up Rich to the limit.
A milk clearing house is the ultimate plan of the health of
ficer. Daily bacteriological tests of milk from every dairy in
the city will be made. Every botile of milk that is delivered
in the city will have a seal over the mouth, on which will be a
guarantee of the city health department as to the cleanliness,
nutriment and purity of the contents.
Dr. Rich outlined his plan to the officials of the health de
partment, the city council. State 'Dairy Inspector H. T.
Graves, and a number of physician* at the health office yes
terday afternoon.
Has Heart-Gripping Motive to Spur Him On
Dr. Rich is a famous surgeon. He has a big practice in
Portland and Tacoma. But for the past lo years he has found
moments in his spare time to devote to the stu^y of milk.
He has a real motive for his study. He explained his mo
tive to the city council a year or so ago "when he appeared be
fore that body to argue for the adaption of the tuberculin test
for milch cows, which has since dque effective work in clean
ing up Tacoma's milk supply. .
The surgeon had a fine, hcaltllp Utile boy, four and one
half years old. The child contracted spinal meningitis, and
passed away despite the efforts of his father and every special
ist that could be obtained. His dtalh was directly caused by
impure milk.
Ever since that time Dr. Rich lias devoted much time to a
crusade for saving the lives of atnr little boys and girls.
As a living argument for the council and health officials
yesterday he had four little cHildr^n present at the health con
ference^ —children who were wasting away under the almost
incurable effects of boviiie tuberculosis, spinal meningitis.
Milk Will Be Brought in Perfectly Fresh
He held a clinic before the amazed eyes of the city hall dads,
and there were a half dozen prominent physicians present who
testified that each child could have been saved -could have
been a normal, healthy little boy or girl—had it received a
pure milk supply during infancy.
Here is the plan which Dr. Rich has put up to the milk
