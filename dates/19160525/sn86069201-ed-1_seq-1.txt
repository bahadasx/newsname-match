Promptly at one o'clock yesterday,
Judge S. W. Hager, of Owensboro, as
Chairman of the State Central and
Executive Committees, called to order
the Democratic State Convention in
Woodland Park, Lexington.
The hall was filled to its capacity
with delegates from every one of the
100 legislative districts in Kentucky.
Upon the call for nominations for
temporary chairman, former Congress
man W. D. Kimball, of Lexington, pro
posed Gov. Stanley for temporary pre
siding officer, after taking occasion to
welcome the delegates to Lexington, he
paid an ejoquent tribute to Gov. Stan
ley and his public services.
A big demonstration following his
mention of the Governor's name.
Gcvtrnor Stanley was chosen by ac
clamation as temporary chairman of
the convention and he was immediately
escorted to the stand amid rousing
cheers from the delegates as he made
his appearance upon the stage Gov
ernor Stanley then delivered the key
note speech of the convention, which
was said to have been the best effort
of his life. The entire program of the

BLUE GRASS SEED
CROP SHORT.
Reports now Indicate that the Blue
Grass seed crop will be one of the
shortest In years. It Is reported that
almost all of the blue grass pastures
have been taken heavily with whits
clever and that on this account the
blue grass has been smothered out to a
Urge extent. The extreme dry weath
er for the past month has also Injured
the crop very materially.
SCARCITY OF
ENGLISH SPARROWS.
Noticing the scarcity of English
sparrows and knowing Major Jim Burn-
side to be a close observer of anlmrl,
vegetable and mineral life, we asked
him the cause. He tells us that oiling
the streets is the direct cause, the
sparrows gettting the oil on their feet
and then on their eggs will not allow
their eggs to hatch, he also says many
leave town for the country as soon as
the oil is spread in order to get their
dust baths. Thus we see the oil abates
not only the dust and fiy nuisance but
the English sparrows as well.
INTERESTED AND IN
TERESTING VISITORS.
On last Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Clar
ence Williamson, Dr. and Mrs. Lan
drum McFarland, motored over from
Lexington spending a few hours with
Mr. and Mrs. Will Lackey and the
family of Judge R. A. Burnside, re
turning to Lexington after lunch in the
evening.
Mrs. Williamson will be remembered
as "Genie" Dunlap and Dr. McFarland
as "Lannle JUcrarland when they
visited so often the home of their
grand-parents. Gen, and Mrs. W. J.
Landrum. Mrs. Williamson is now an
active church worker and club womtn
in Lexington while Dr. McFarland Is
un eminent New York, M. D., yet they
Both retain an interest and love in their
childhood friends, also evincing pride in
every improvement and a deep love for
Lancaster.
MONTGOMERY
HERE MONDAY,
Mingling with the court day crowd
here last Monday was Hon Charles F,
Montgomery, of Casey, who is a can
didate for the Democratic nomination
for congress from this district. He
was highly pleased with the warm re
ception be received here and made many
friends, many of whom had never met
him before. In the afternoon a strong
organization was formed in the interest
of his coming campaign and a working
committee was perfected in every pre.
clnct in the county, with Mr. James
Clark as its chairman.
While not on the ground In person,
the friends of Hon. Hurvey Helm, were
also active in his interest and to a man
"up a tree" it locks as if the race be
tween these two gentlemen will be a
close one, at least in this county.
CHILDREN EMPLOY
MENT DURING VACATION
The problem of finding useful occu
pation for children during vacation
begins to worry parents as the school
year draws to a close. Though the
youngsters are supposed to suffer from
strain of school life, they often get
more tired and nervous during vaca
tlon. Some useful occupation for part
time serves as a balance wheel to till
regulated activity.
The United States bureau of educa
tion recommends that in each school
there be one teacher who has practi
cal knowledge about gardening. This
teacher should be employed through
out the year. She should help pupils
select seed, visit gardens and assenv
ble children in groups for instruction
in this work.
Many lawless ways disappear with
regular tasks. Once a boy has seen
his fruits and vegetables robbed by
some youngster, he gets the owner's
point of view. Atter that, stealing
things from a neighbor does not seem
funny and glorious.
