ed the work which he has in mind for
tlm organization diiMur: the coming
year.
"Hitherto," suid the new president,
"our bureau has devoted Its attention
utmost exclusively to agricultural
matters and there is no doubl that
substantial results have been achiev
ed in furthering better farming in the
county. We have no Intention of let
ting up in the least in this line of ae-:
tivity but my Idea is that this year
we should make greater efforts to pro
mote things tha( , pertain t0 "1; l,ro'
gress of Chickasha, doing the work
which a chamber of commerce should
do. 1 hope to present "more specific
plans for this work Tit our next meet
ing. The farm development work con
cerns the entire county and should be
supported by other communities in tin
county as well as by Chickasha. Wfi
hope to separate this part of bureau
work from that which particularly of
fects Chlckaslm and to enlist all the
people of Grady county in the move
ment for better agriculture."
In addition to Mr. Cook, the
newly
elected officers of the bureau are as
follows: Myron Humphrey, vice pres
ident; F. L. Slusher, treasurer; L. C.
Hutson, Orln Ashton, W. H. Donahue.
W. II. Gilkey, Ed F. Johns, Hen F.
Morgan, II. L, .Wallace. J. W. Kayser.
M. F. Courtney, C. H. Caneman, O.
Coffman, G. H. Kvans.
The report of Secretary Clark show
ed a balance of about $11 In the treas
ury at the close of tiie year, with
some accounts outstanding and some
dues still unpaid. When all accounts
are squared up there will still be a
small deficit in the treasury. The
county agent's car has recently-run up
n large expense hill for repairs and it
was decided to sell the same and buy
a new car. ,A committee was appoint
ed to make, the deal. The committee
Is composed of Hen Morgr.n, C. II.
Caneman, K. L. Wallace and W. W.
Clark.
Mayor Coffjnnn made a statement to

men's association, now In tession at
rushing, w anted to hold its next .meet

ed to wire Chief Gattls, who is attend
ing the meeting, to the. effect that this
city will be glad to entertain them
next year.
County Agent Cooper made an oral
report on crop conditions in the coun
ty and the progress of the demonstra
tion work. Grady county now has
more members of the boys' and girls'
clubs than any other county In the
state, he stated. The boys' clubs
have 3S2 members. Much of the sue
cess of the cluh work, Mr. Cooper said
wns due to the hearty co-operation
which the county superintendent and
teachers of the county are giving in
the movement.
Of the, 100,000 or more acres of
wheat sown last fall, Mr. Cooper said
something like 50.000 acres remained
and, with another good rain during the
next ten days should make a good
yield. Many of the wheat fields were
plowed up because of failure to get a
stand and In other cnseB It suffered
from lack of moisture.
"Our cotton acreage Is increased
from about 10,000 acres last year to
about 03,000 acres," said the agent
"A good part of the wheat land that
was plowed tip was planted to cot
ton."
of it will be ready (or cutting the last
of the week. The oats crop has not
done well. Alfalfa has flourished and
there is' a net Increase of about 10,000
acres in the amount of land devoted
to this crop. Nearly every farmer in
the county lias planted some "sure
feed" crops, Mr. Cooper stated. A
large ncrenge of melons has been
planted. While there will be practi
cally no apples or peaches, berries,
cherries and grapes promise well.
Mr Pnmipr further static! that, harr-
jng the invasion of the com fields by
rats, pests are giving little trouhVe.
In a few Instances greenbugs and
chinch bugs, also a n..w type of in
sect, known as the false cliinchbug,
have been operating but the damage
has been confined to a few fields. Mr.
Cooper said the government was send
ing a serum to inoculate the rats, as
a result of which this pest should be
under control within a month.
As a result of the vaccination move
ment and the taking of sanitary meas
ures, Mr. Cooper said hog cholera had
practically been wiped out in the
county, only two cases having been
recently reported.

BAD CHECKS
COMEBACK
TO BANKS
A check artist has been making
some easy money in Chickasha and vi
cinity during Uie past two weeks and
as far as is known is still at his game.
The man came to Chickasha about ten
davs ago, cashing a check on an El
Reno bank and signed by a supposedly
firm of that city, at a local store.
There was nothing to excite suspicion
until the check was returned to Chick
asha today after having been sent to
Kansas City and thence to El Reno,
with the statement that no such firm
had an account at the bank drawn on.
The next chapter of the stor r.i
which the dexterous fingered hero oc
curs is staged in Lawton the first of
this week, where he cashed two
checks on the First National bank of
this city and one on the Chickasha Na
tional. These were returned to Chick
asha yesterday. The checks were
made out to II. E. Brown and H. E.
Moore and bore? the rubber stamp sig
natures of Langdon Co.., Morrison
Produce Co., and Morrison Co.
All of these checks were for less
than $10, the disburser of the paper
taking his chances of not exciting thejj.
Incredulity of any of his victims by
trying to get a larger sum. It is stat
ed that in one or two Instances he of
fered to take part of the money in
trade, thus winning favor with the
merchant.

Berlin, May 25. The bloodiest
fighting in the history . the world is
in progress as the giant German "nut
cracker" closes in on the right jaw
of Verdun.
The Germans advanced along a three
mile front northwest of the fortress
and the French finally evacuated the
entire Deadman s Hill position alter
sacrificing over a whole army corps
in vain efforts to hold their ground.
The Germans have not yet occupied
all of the abandoned works as the
French artillery is sweeping over the
southern ridges of the hill.
- The French and Germans are jointly
holding Hill No. 30 1 and further ad
vances in the ravines will force the
French to abandon that position also
before the advance of the German
right wing which occupied Cumieres.
It is estimated that thirty thousand
men are already under ground, vic
tims of the carnage of the past seventy-two
hours about Douamont while
thousands of ymnded are lying
strewn along the western approaches
on the field which is swept by wither
ing cross-fire.
It is authoritatively denied that the
French re-occupied Fort Douamont as
they claim. One force penetrated the
Interior of the ruins but the Germans 1
annihilated them.

TO MEET
TONIGHT

meeting this evening, convening at
:'oQ o'clock.

ed to show up. The matter of the ap

tee will report favorably upon this
proposition, with the possible recom
mendation that an officer owning his
own motorcyc le be added to the force.

ing the alley intersecting the property
upon which the junior high' school
building is to be erected, will also
come before the board. It Is almost
certain that the required order will
be made.
It is also understood that Police
Chief Phillips will report that a quiet
lot of pussy-footing done during the
past several nights by himself and a
number of his officers, will show that
the general auto-owning public are
now prone to obey the mandates of
the traffic and speed ordinances.
Chief Phillips has had officers "planted'-'
at different parts of the city for
the past i;everal nights "holding cases"
on all autos and the findings seem to
show that reckless driving Heems to
have been reduced to the minimum,
especially of evenings.
The approval of bonds of new ser
vice car drivers will be about all of
the other business, outside the regu
lar routine whic h may be expec ted to
come before the council tonight.
