Handsome Bungalow

Billie Burke In Peggy,
Realism At High Cost
Money was spent lavishly in the
production of the Billie Burke-Tri
angle Play, "Peggy." On one street
scene $5,000 was expended. Thirty
buildings were required. Ince was de
termined the street should be like sim
ilar ones in Scotland, where the action
of the play takes place. So it was
built, with its quaint kirk, inn, thatch
ed and vine covered cottages.
The interiors required furniture of
the stiff, straight-backed variety was
nothing of the kind to be found on
the coast, so three car loads of furni
ture were shipped from New York.
To obtain it, the antique shops of the
metropolis were ransacked.
The scenes depicting the life of
Miss Burke as a member of the "Four
Billie Burk« In Pajamas In the hie*
Triangle-Fine Art* Romantic Come
4y Pegay-"
Hundred," entertaining a week-end
party at her country place near New
York, are equally realistic. There are
sweeping green lawns with large
spreading trees, marble fountains and
sculptures, while near by stands a
palatial residence. The interior is
furnished with the quiet tone of ele
gance that mark* the connoisseur.
Costly rugs, paintings, vases with cut
flowers, antiques, hangings, books and
all the rest of the things that appeal
to good, taste hayabeen provided.
A fairyland that had to be twice
created was another undertaking that
time and money were spent on, and
which well repaid the cost. First, the
various costumes and settings had to
be especially made. Then came some
remarkable camera work. Some of
the most notable things ever done, in
the way of illusive effects, were
wrought under the direction of Thom
as H. Ince. While Billie Burke trips
through the moonlight she meets
gnomes, elves, a wicked old witch, Dr.
Goat and an assemblage of bugs.
A notable "stunt'' is the sudden
transformation of a bug back into the
prince he really is. A few drops of
a magic liquid that Miss Burke sprin
kles from a bottle do the trick. This
novelty has attracted much surprise
as to how it is done.
Peggy will be exhibited at the Or
pheum theatre Friday and Saturday,
May 26-27.

SURPRISE BANDITS AT RANCH
RENDEZVOUS
Carranza Orders 30,000 To Border
Washington, May 23.—The Car
ranza government has ordered 30,000
troops into the region south of the
border to exterminate bandits, accord
ing to information received at the
state department. General Obregon's
original orders, issued after his con
ference at El Paso with Generals
Scott and Funston, assigned 10,000
men to General Trevino to thoroughly
police the territory south of the
American expedition.
Field Headquarters in Mexico, May
16.—(via Motor to Columbus, N. M.,
May 23.)—Automobiles were put to
a new military use in the Villa cam
paign May 14, when the bandit leader,
Colonel Cardenas, was killed with two
of his lieutenants.
Three touring cars from General
Pershing's camp, started about mid
day for the Rancho San Miguel De
Rubio, a short run across the moun
tains, the residence of the Cardenas
family and the scene of pot-shooting
occasionally at American troops.
The Cardenas family, all women and
children, had remained unmolested,,
notwithstanding positive information
to the American staff that the bandit
frequently used his ranch for a
rendezvous.
The automobilists with an order to
buy corn as the ostensible purpose,
made a fast run over the mountain
foothills to the ranch, under command
of Lieutenant George S. Patton, Jr.,
of General Pershing's staff.
Within a mile of the ranch the cars
topped a hill, from which they made
a dash toward their objective which
would have been impossible for cav
alry. Running at sixty miles per
hour speed, they were within less
than 200 yards of the ranch buildings
before their presence was discovered.
A Mexican, working in the yard
gave the' warnirtg, but it was too late.
By the time Colonel Cardenas and his
two men could get their horses and
dash for the ranch gate, the Ameri
cans had surrounded the place.
Cardenas was the first man to
emerge from shelter. He and Lieu
tenant Patton engaged in a pistol duel
in which a shot from Patton's weapon
broke the bandit's arm and drove him
back into the ranch house, later to be
killed by American soldiers, when he
tried to escape.
NEWS BULLETIN
Larger postal savings deposits will
now be accepted at the post office.
This is made possible by an important
amendment to the Postal Savings Act
just approved by President Wilson. A
postal savings depositor may now
have an account amounting to $1,000
upon which interest will be paid. For
merly $500 was the maximum amount
he could have to his credit. This en
largement of postal savings facilities
will be very gratifying to thousands
of depositors who have already reach
ed the old $500 limit and are anxious
to entrust more of their savings to
Uncle Sam. Another feature of the
mendment that will avoid further
embarrasment to the public and to
postal officials is the doing away with
the limit on the amount that could be
accepted from a depositor monthly.
Under the old law only $100 could be
deposited in a calendar month. The
amendment abolishes this restriction.
While the Postal Savings System has
already proved a signal success as is
shown by the fact that more than
half-a-million depositors have over
eighty million dollars standing to
their credit, still it has fallen short
of meeting the full demands of the
public because of the restrictions
which have now been eliminated.
Postmaster General Burleson and
Third Assistant Postmaster General
Dockery have been tireless in their
efforts to secure a modifications of the
limitations and the new liberalizing
legislation is particularly gratifying
to them.
Birth of a Nation at

On account of the number of in
quiries it has been requested that we

matinee commencing Monday, July
24th. The contract calls for an or
chestra of at least twenty-one mem
bers and a stage crew of eight for
the handling of effects.

THE BACCALAUREATE
SERVICE, AT ARMORY
PROGRAM, SUNDAY, 28TH MARKS
BEGINNING OF COMMENCE
MENT EVENTS
plans for the BacealaUdeate
service to be held at the Armory an
ditorium on Sunday of this week are
probably more inclusive than have
heretofore been arranged, for the
Armory lends itself splendidly to
such arrangements.
The members of the class of nine
teen hundred sixteen have invited
Rev. E. P. O'Neill to give the
Baccalaureate sermon.
Under the leadership of Professor
Onstad, a large chorus is being gath
ered and the music of the occasion
promises to be of more than ordinary
merit.
These arrangements are based upon
the assumption that the school com
mencement time is essentially a time
of community interest, and full ef
forts are being made to make all ex
ercises worthy of a large attendance.
There is no admission fee to any of
the commencement exercises, and the
public are most cordially invited. The
following program is arranged for
Sunday night service.
Entrance March Orchestra
Opening Hymn "Onward Christian
Soldiers....Chorus, with orchestra

FIRE DESTROYED ABANDON
BOATS
One night of last week, about mid
night, two house boats on the river
bank near the Reclamation Pumping
station were burned. The current im
pression was that the boats were
property of the Reclamation Service.
These boats were merely shells of
two house boats built for temporary
use by the War Department during
the placing of the bank revetment of
the river. They were empty and were
outside the Reclamation Service en
closure. Of late tramps have broken
in and found them a convenient place
for sleep and shelter although they
have been repeatedly boarded up.
Evidently some hoboes seeking shelter
for the night were careless with
matches and set fire to the boats. The
Reclamation Service property is well
guarded and isolated and was not
damaged.
Expects Bridge Bill
To Pass Next Week
In a letter to R. M. Calderwood,
president of the Missouri River
Bridge Co. Congress P. D. Norton
says of the pontton bridge bill:
"As yet, I have not been successful
in securing the passage in the House
of the bill authorizing the construc
tion of a bridge across the Missouri
River at Williston. However, we have
been making some progress with the
bill. The bill has already been acted
upon favorably by the Committee on
Foreign and Interstate Commerce, and
has "been approved by the Chief En
gineer of the War Department.
"Last week, I had the bill placed
upon the Unanimous Consent Calen
der of the House, and it will be taken
up and passed just as soon as any
bills can be reached on this Calendar.
I expect to find or make an opportun
ity to have this bill called up and pass
ed by the House next week. I shall
keep you advised from time to time
as to the progress we may be able to
make with the bill."
Purchase Lumber
The purchasing committee are to
day considering bids on lumber for
the bridge and carpenters will be at
work on the boats in a few days.
Prospects Good
For Market Day
Max Zimmerman says:
"Everybody get ready for next Sat
urday Booster Market Day. Let us
make it a Big Success, that's the way.
Booster Zimmerman is talking now.
He has a fine list of Booster Backers
and is very much pleased with the
prospects of a Big Day. He asks all
business houses to decorate and put
on a festival appearance. He also
requests everybody to get in the
parade which will form in front of
the armory at 1:30 o'clock sharp,
Zimmerman is no ammetur in his line
of work, and has made a success of
these days all over the country with
very few exceptions. Booster Market
Day is a good thing for the town, the
farmer and the merchant, it turns a
little town into a Big Busy City for
one day. At least the people are
comings from all over. Mai* haa Jsft.
nothing undone to advertise the event
thoroughly and if the weather is right
look for a record breaking crowd. We
call your attention to the full list of
Boosters as published in another
column. The route of the parade will
be as follows: From the Armory to
Broadway over Broadway to 1st Ave,
West, to 1st St. to 1st Ave. East to
Front St. then over to Main St. up
Main to Broadway then over to the
Auto Motor Mart where Prices and
Premiums will be given.''
Are You Keeping Up
The Cleanup Campaign
Are you working, boys and
girls, for the prize money in the
City Beautiful Contest? Is your
bird house up, your garden plant
ed and your yard in good order?
Think of having a beautiful
garden all your very own and a
tiny bird house with the father
and mother bird all the little birds
living there and singing for you.
Is not that a whole lot better than
a pile of garbage with a huge
family of flies living therfe, or a
garden.of weeds, or a poor little
bird that your sling shot brought
down just when it was soaring so
gayly all ready to sing to you, or
flying down to eat the worms that
were destroying your garden?
A little dead bird that can never
sing again because of you. Then
you let that fly escape that will
walk in on your bread and swim
in your cream and bring sickness
to your baby brother or sister or
yourself.
Sometime when you are down
fishing, dig up a little rose bush,
there are always some along the
creek, take it home and plant it
in your own yard. You know
that's our state flower and it will
help make your yard beautiful.
Remember, your pledge to do
all you can to help make Willis
ton a better place to live and do
it now and all the time. And if
there are some grownup people
you know who are not fixing up
their yard, show them your pledge
and ask them if they don't think
that is a fine thing to do.
Later we have a surprise for
you, everyone of you who have
helped whether you win the prize
money or not. So though you may
not have the best place it is worth
while to try.

GOOD GAMES—RETURN SER
IES NEXT WEEK
Glendive 6, Williston 5.
Glendive 0, Williston 1.
Glendive 2, Williston 8.
In three exciting contests the Wil
liston Opportunes measured skill with
the Glendive Cubs Friday and Satur
day evenings and Sunday afternoon
and took the long end of the series, to
the delight and satisfaction of their
supporters. It was the first test of
the team and the first chance they had
to work together against stiff opposi
iton.
Their trouble came in a bunch in
the very first of the first game. Hita
by Glendive and errors by the locala
netted the visitors four runs. Pull
ing themselves together and tighten
ing up in fine style, the 'Tunes har
monized their attack and made a
great uphill fight, coming within one
of tying the score.
The Saturday evening game was
one of the fastest and neatest ever
played on the grounds and was
pitchers battle. Ruyle was steady and
effective at all times while Manring
weakened just enough in the third
frame to allow a run.
The rain of Sunday slackened just
enough between five and seven Sun
day evening to allow the third game
which resulted in the most decisive
score of the three, in favor of the
home players. Murphy made his
pitching debut, in "fast" company.
He was wild but hard to hit, fanning
nine of the Cubs.
It is a pleasure to have a team like'
that representing Glendive come to
the city for a series. They are good
ball players, good losers and gentle
men whom it is a pleasure to meet.
They made some unfortunate errors
but are a team that will give all'
comers plenty of opposition.
The Williston team goes to Glen
dive for a three game series' May
28-29 and 80. Quite a few fans will
make the trip with them. Weather
£oiisI3ered the*gate receipts were good
and netted a profit.
