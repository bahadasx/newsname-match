PLAN FAIR TO ALL, i
SOLE PEACE BASIS
President Thinks a Neutral
Could Act Only With That I.
Understanding.
HOLDS WORLD HAS STAKE I
DUE TO BE CONSIDERED;
White House Callers Gather Impres- '
sion Early Move by U. S.
Is Unlikely. ,
President Wilson told callers
today that the intervention of a ],
neutral in behalf of peace in Ku- ,
rope could rest only on ;t mutual ,
understanding by the belligerents ,
that terms to be arranged are to ,
conserve the interests of all. and ]
of the world at large, rather than ! (
those of a particular nation or (
group OI IldUUUS aim-rug i?.Nwarring
powers. I
Mr. Wilson did not disclose any definite
plan of action he may have formulated in 1
regard to peace nor authorize a formal
statement of his Attitude. His callers
gained an impression, however, that the
President would entertain suggestions 1
that he extend his good offices to the
belligerents to bring about peace only j '
when the conditions he outlined were ! 5
likely of fulfillment. j :
Forecast of Speech. ,
Those 'who discussed the general sub- <
Ject of peace with Mr. Wilson construed 1
his remarks as probably forecasting to '
some extent what he will say here later in 1
the week, addressing the League to En- '<
force Peace. The impression has obtained l
in official circles that his remarks at that ^
time would have an important bearing on
the peace discussions recently in Berlin j
and London, as well as in the American
press. 1
Mr. Wilson pointed out to his callers 1
that there are many elements in the (
situation in Europe, all of which must x
be taken into account inecopsideration
of peace proposals. While he is eager f
to see the conflict ended as soon as pos- t
eible, the White House visitors were t
able to gather no impression that a
move by the l"nited States to bring it
about is in immediate prospect, at
least.
Mr. Hensley Talks Peace.
Representative Hensley of Missouri \
discussed with Mr. Wilson his amend- f
went to the naval bill, adopted by the J a
naval committee, authorizing the Presi- j r
dent to invite other nations to partici- J 0
pate in a conference at the close of the J s
war with f the objeot^f setting up a,g
court or other tribunal to -?ettle inter- ! o
national disputes. !
Mr. Hensley told the President that j c
he believed this amendment ri^ade the j f
naval bill an assurance to foreign na- 1
tions that the United Stater; was arm- r
ing for defense only, not for any offensive
purpose, and was ready to en- .
ter into an agreement to settle inter- 9
national disputes amicably. ?
The President did not commit him- ?
self definitely to the amendment, but
Mr. Hensley gained the impression that
he was favorable to the general principles
involved.
Hopeful of the Future.
While Mr. Hensley would not reveal ' c
details of his conversation with the r
President, he said he wished the people x
generallv could realize the thoughts in t
the President's mind in considering r
peace, and the many questions bearing g
on it which he is considering.
Mr. Hensley left the White House g
satisfied That the President would do r
everything possible to bring about j r
pe^ce in Europe and to maintain it I#,
after the end of the war. j c
Mr. Hensley said that he believed
the people of the United States gen- , r
erally were looking to the President to j
play an important part in minimizing !
the danger of war in the future He j
told the President he saw no reason ; t
why the time should not come when i
an international court would ha\e the
name standing as the United States t
Supreme Court and when its decisions f
would be respected in the same way. j

GERM HEADY
FOR PEACE TENDERS
Willing to Accept President
Wilson's Good Offices in
Mediation.
ONLY THE HOTSPURS
ARE OPPOSING HIM
Nation Does Not Wish Formally to
Accept. Then Later Be
Spurned by Allies.
BERLIN, Mav 24, via London,
May 25 (delayed)?A wireless
dispatch from the United States,
git'ing the substance of President
Wilson's speech at Charlotte,
iii which he feferrecl to the
possibility of American mediation
in the war. is given the place of
honor in the morning papers. The
afternoon editions return to the
subject, and their comments, together
with the wide interest
shown by the German public,
show how important this news is
regarded here.
Though definitely stated nowhere,
there is little doubt that Germany is
willing to consider a tender of good
offices to inaugurate peace negotiations.
The former attitude in the highest
quarters that America had disqualified
herself as a peace mediator on
account of her shipments of munitions
to the allies has now changed. If
President Wilson can hold out any
tangible possibilities that peace may
result through his mediation, Germany
undoubtedly will be willing to consider
such suggestions as he may offer.
One Condition Cited.
This receptive attitude is naturally
subject to the condition that Germany ,
is not jockeyed into a position of an
nouncing her readiness to accept Pres- ]
ident Wilson's good offices, only to find j
the allies later rejecting the tender <
and asserting that Germany is swing
for peace. There is equally litf le doubt i
that the great masses of the people <
aside from the professional hotspurs i
in the newspaper offices would*willing- 1
ly see America in the role of peace in- *
termediary despite the persistent bit- 1
terness over the munitions question.
As a matter of fact little is heard
nowadays, either from the general public
or from the press, on the subject of
American shipments of arms. The
question seems to have been submerged i
by other problems of existence which
are of more immediate importance to
the nation.
Bitter Feeling Shown.
President Wilson's declaration can?<
not he said, however, to have made a j
good impression in Germany, as far as i
the so-called "armor plate" newspa- j
pers. like the Tages Zeitung and the I
Taglische Rundschau, are concerned.!
Other chauvinist organs take occasion |
to remember President Wilson with j
bitter and uncomplimentary phrases, j
and even a moderate paper like the i
l^okal Anzeiger, declares that the Presi- j
dent should fir?t demonstrate the im- .?
partiality of his neutrality by making !
good his demand for respect for Amen- j
can rights against England. He would ! then
have an excellent chance, says this I
paper, of succeeding in his peace mission,
at least as far as Germany is concerned.
The rumors of mediation have affected
the Berlin stock market. "War
babies," which have been generally
weak, dronned lower still on retiorts
that America and other neutral eouri- j
tries were contemplating a tender of
their good offices as peace mediators.
At the same time "peace stocks," such
as shipping arid colonial securities, are
in strong demand.
Negotiations for Peace
Not Now Possible, Says
Grey, Answering Attack
LONDON, May 25.?In an impromptu
speech in the house of commons last
night on the question of peace, a subject
unexpectedly raised by Arthur
Ponsonby. liberal member for Stirling,
Scotland, in a strong address attacking
the government for allowing diplomatic
etiquette to stand in the way of 1
possible peace pourparlers. Sir Edward
Grey, the British foreign secretary, set
aside all ideas that peace negotiations
were possible at the present stage and
plainly reiterated that the position of
the allies was in no way changed.
Sir Edward declared that it was im-,
possible to consider terms of peace
without a previous agreement between
the entente allies. Further, he expressed
the decided opinion that the
hostilities had not yet reached a stage
where it was possible to talk of peace,
especially as the German public was | 1
constantly being "fed with lies" by
their ministers.
Would Not Prolong War.
Mr. Ponsopby argued in favor of'
countenancing peace possibilities and :
against prolonging the war merely for
the ?ake of obligations to Great Britain's
allies, and if there were no essential
differences between Germany and!
Great Britain and no such obligations
thf government ought to take the i
earliest opportunity to press for ai
termination of the war I
Sir Edward Grey, in replying, pointed
out that his interview contained no
new declaration. He had no prepared
speech or statement to make, tbut he
said if he thought the German govern- i
ment or German opinion had reached
the point where the allied governments
could bring a peace compatible with
their desires nearer by making speeches j
about peace, he would make dozens of
them. But the foreign minister added"
that time has not yet arrived, and the
allies were hound by common obligations
not to put forward any terms of
peace except by mutual agreement.
Attacks British Diplomacy. <
Mr. Ponsonby strongly attacked the '
government's diplomacy. He said the :
peace of Europe would depend on the *
capacity of statesmen for surveying the '
great problems in a broad spirit. The i
Insularity which had characterized
British diplomacy in the past consti- j
- 4 I
r j
\ convention
tuted the real danger. The government I
must recognize that the war had I
reached a deadlock, and at the same I
rime the superior position of Great |
Britain also must he recognized. The
latter was due to the spirit and valor
jf the people, and not to statesmen.
.lames Ramsay Macdonald, a brother
member, supported Mr. Ponsonby. He
declared that peace was a politeal and
tot a military problem, and that it
was the duty of the government to
state the terms on which it was prepared
to conclude a peace. j
Cites Attitude of France.
Sir Edward*Orev said that if any of
:he ailies had a right to speak with
-egard to peace at the present moment
t was France, on 'whom the concentrated
fury of the German attack had
ieen thrown. Rebuking Mr. Ponsonby
for making no allusion to Verdun, Sir c
Edward said '"Through the long bat- rl
tie of Verdun France is saving not r
t>nly herself, hut her allies as well, f
If any one has a right to speak about j j
peace it Is Trance, and President Poin- | r]
"are has spoken. I believe, it is the | ^
luty or diplomacy to maintain the ! s
solidarity of the allies and give the
utmost support to tne navai ana mm- . "
:ary measures which are being; taken ' r
r?y the allies in common to bring the I
ivar to a stage it has not yet reached
ind in which the prospect of maintaining
an enduring peace will he with i
;he allies. Mr. Ponsonby has hardly v
seemed to realize, that we were at
war." d

Political Sentiment in

K
That there has been a wonderful h
hange of sentiment toward Presi- f{
lent Wilson in New York, New Jer- ^
ey and eastern states generally?all 'j]
avorable to his success in November
n these states?was the information tl
leveloped in New York in the last few jr
lays among the political generals ii
fathered there, according to intimate g
riends of the President who have just tl
eturned from that city. b
President Wilson did not confer with ii
?'ew York or other politicians while o
ri that city yesterday to attend the a
redding of Dr. Grayson and Miss.Gor
on, hut it is known that one of the "
resident's closest friends and ad- e!
isers who was in that city for several
lays has sent word to the President a
hat New'York will be for him in Noember
after a long period of hostility Q
oward him. h
It develops from this source of in- ^
ormation that Charles Murphy, the 11
eader of Tammany, has passed word ^
mong the organization democrats from 1
11 states who have dropped in on him fl
hat Wilson will carry New York and
till succeed himself in the White II
louse, regardless of what anybody ?
oes against him or whom the republl- /
ans nominate to oppose him.
Tammany to Back Him.
The democrats of the Murphy type St
ave been studying political conditions
enerally. it was said today, and have
assed the word that President Wilson
? in one of those enviable positions
riat mean almost sure election and
iey are prepared to back him as Winer
with large wagers if they can find R
ny. s'
These democrats have discounted the p
omination of either Roosevelt or ol
lughes at f'hicago. Right now they ti
re disposed to believe that Roosevelt
s at the top of another emotional **
ave that may carry him to victory in fc
le Chicago convention, but they main- is
lin that if he fails with the republicns
he will again have himself nomnated
by the progressives, once more tl
uttirig three presidential tickets in
ie field and re-electing Wilson.
President Wilson's friends today repesented
him as showing great un- '
onoern what the republicans will do b'
t Chicago. He is making no in- ti
uirtes and his only source of infor- pi
lation as to probabilities is the news- a
apers. According to his friends all in

iddons interfered and said to Mr. Fitts: "You
are going far beyond the limits
p any cross-examination," and Mr.
arlington, senior counsel for the dense,
arose in his place and stated:
hich I have been a member for many

Threatens to Clear Court.
Justice Siddons threatened again and 1

demonstration such as arose in ^
e way of laughter or comment while .
r. Hogag was on the stand to remove j
e spectators from the room. The
urt was crowded with lawyers and
hers, gathered to witness the verbal J
Lttle between Mr. Hogan and Mr. j '
tts. and frequently when counsel for 1 J
e defense sought to interpose objecins
to Mr. Hogan's cross-examina- in.
in his behalf, he waved them back j
om the witness stand and begged j
lease do not interrupt us." \
He made every answer to Mr. Fitts'
lestions, apparently, an occasion for ,
aborating points that he wished the
iry to take in. addressing himself fre- ,
lently to the twelve men in the jury
>x. occasionally interjecting such rearks
as "The jury knows what I mean
hether you do or not." Justice Sid- .
>ns at one point, in answer to objec- .
3ns by the government, cautioned Mr.
Dean to avoid weaving arguments ^
to his replies to the cross-examina- i
>n. and again and again Mr. Hogan j
>inted out that it was necessary for J
m to explain his answers.
The defense evidently thought that Mr. |
)gan had made such an exceptionally ^
od witness from its point of view, in h
ftw of the fact that today and yester- ! f
y he explained to the Jury again
d again that the sole responsi- s
lity for the affidavit which caused \

1 not, place on the stand either
r. Glover or the Messrs. Flather. '

It was said informally in the court- 0

LEGAL FIGHT IS ON
TO SAVE DR. WAITE
Counsel for Accused Slayer of
John E. Peck Marshals
His Witnesses.
WILL ATTEMPT TO SHOW
DENTIST'S MIND DISEASED
Brother First to Testify?Father
and Alienists to Follow?Prisoner
Also to Take Stand.
NEW YORK. May >5.?The
fight to save Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite from the electric chair began
today before Justice Shearn
11 the criminal branch of the
-upreme court. The prosecution
:losed its case yesterday, and this
morning counsel for the defense
marshaled alienists and relatives
of the accused man to prove that
he was insane when he killed his
wealthy father-in-law. John E. .
Peck of Grand Rapids, Mich., by
giving him repeated doses of
arsenic.
Walter R Deuel, counsel for Dr.
Waite. began his opening address for
the defense when the hearing was resumed
this morning. Mr. Deuel said he
pxpeeted to finish the case for the defense
by Friday night.
Attendance at the trial was somewhat
decreased today. Mrs. Clara Peck
Waite, the prisoner's wife, sat near the
jury box partly hidden from the gaze
of the spectators. Miss Elizabeth B.
Hardwick, who sent the "K. Adams"
message giving Percy Peck warning of
suspicious of murder, was in the courtroom.
as were also Warren Wf Waite,
father of the young dentist, and Frank
A. Waite. his brother.
Prisoner to Take Stand.
In beginning his address. Mr. Deuel
told the jurors it would be shown that
Dr. Waite was of unsound mind. He
also announced that the prisoner would
take the stand.
Waite's history, the attorney added,
would show his mental weakness, while
his father and two brothers would testify
as to the prisoner's condition and
concerning circumstances in his early
life. Counsel promised to produce alienists
to show that Waite's mind is diseased.
It is understood that the defense
will make no claim that Waite is Insane
at the present time. An effort
will be made to show that he was in a
highly nervous stat#? for several months
preceding the death of Mr. Peck: that
he was subject to "obsessions" and the
victim of mental suggestions coming
from another self, which the defendant
called "the man from Egypt."
Frank A. Waite. the dentist's brother.
was the first witness for the defense.
He said that because Dr; Waite
had a large head the other members of
the Waite family "poked fun at him."
Waite a Wayward Boy.
Frank Waite said his brother lagged on
the way to school when, a child and was
tlways getting into trouble with other
t>oys. Arthur was eighteen years old
ivhen he ehtered the University of Michigan.
He sent back $7,000 from South
\frica and brought $1,500 more when he
-eturned. the witness said.
The brother d^seribed visits to Waite's
i part men z wher. ne ray in a stuper from
larcotics and said the dentist then talked
it random and in his lucid intervals acted
rar differently than when normal.
Cross-examined. Waite said he remembered
telling a physician at Bollevue
Hospital there was no epilepsy,
mental deficiency nor criminality in the
Waite family.
Waite as a boy was cruel to animals,
developed a habit of lying, and used
to steal from boarders in his home and
from classmates at school and college,
according to Clyde Waite of Grand
Rapids, another brother.
Insanity in the Family.
Warren W. Waite. the dentist's father,
vho next testified, said Miles Waite. th*?
jrisoner's . andfather. disappeared
'rom his home in 1871 and was never
?een again by his family. Orje of the
vitness* aunts died in an insane asyum;
one of her sons is now in an asyum
and another was for a time in a
isychopathic hospital in Ann Arbor, the
vitness sain, adding that a cousin was
leaf and dumb.
Just before the birth of Arthur W.
Vaite his mother was in a weakened
ondition. the father testified. Arthurrave
him more trouble than the other
hildren. r
"He was a liar and a thief in his
chool days, and once took $2*0 from
lis schoolmate." said Mr. Waite.
Arthur was always disobedient and in
ater years morose at times, said thvitness.
Mr. Waite said that on his
rrival in New York he had stated
here was no insanity in his immediate
amily.
r
)escribes Prisoner's Dual Character
Mrs. Margaret Weaver Horton. the
oung woman with whom Dr. Waite
tudied languages and music and
hared a "studio" in a fashionable New
ork hotel, described late yesterday afteroon
what she considered the dual
liaracter of the prisoner.- This alleged
ekyll-Hyde nature of Waite, the evil
de of which he has asserted manifest1
itself in the form of a "little man
om Egypt." gave the first inkling of
le theory upon which Waite's lawyers
ill proceed in their efforts to prove he
as insane at the tim? he killed John
. Peck, and thereby save him from
le electric chair.
Mrs. Horton. who cast sorrowing
lances at Waite as he sat pale and
jtwardly ill at ease, not more than
venty feet from her, followed Mrs.
Lara Louise Peck Waite, wife of the
risoner. on the stand. Mrs. Horton
?ld her story slowly, directly, and gave
te impression that she cared little for
te ordeal to which she herself was
lbjected. It appeared to those who
atched her closely that she was tryg
to convey to the prisoner something
' the sympathy she felt for him.
Although called as a witness for the
ate, Mrs. Horton seemed to be much
lieved when Walter R. Deuel, counsel
r Waite. began to cross-examine her.

lin and raised his eyes toward vha
