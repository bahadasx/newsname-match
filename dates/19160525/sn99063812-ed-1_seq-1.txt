AaOREQATION WILL 'CROSS

STRONO LOCAL CONTINGENT
With Orant Pass as the drawing!
card, a good game Is assured for Sun-j
day afternoen: Grants Pass last year,
with Cornell in the box, gave Klamath
Falls her hardest tusnlo on the local'
grounds. This year they nre coming
with Cornell,- Pcrnnll and Osborne in
the llnup. Cornell needs no introduc
tion. Pernoll, designated "Hub" and
"Piano Legs" while In tho big' leagues,
Is one of the 'best southpaws pitching
today, and on account of his hitting
he Is regarded as strong enough to
play outfield on the Detroit team. Per
noll Ih In Grants Pass, where his fruit
ranch Is located, so as far as Hub Is
concerned he,' Is through with big
league balL
Osborne, the third pitcher, is the
man who led 'the Western Tri-State
pitchers two years ago. No one has
ever understood why Mb has not taken
up any of the offers tendered him by
McCredle and the Northwestern league
magnates, but at present he Is stilt
pitching the best of ball for Grants
Pass. '
It Is a safe' estimate that not more
than two hits will be gathered off any
one of the Pass pitchers, for at the
first sign of weakening, another man
can be sent Into the box for relief.
This In Itself assures us that the game
will not be a-walk-away for the locals.
It Is also reported that Kenneth
Williams, star third baseman for
Cincinnati who Is under suspension
at present, will be with the Pass team
Sunday, although his name does not
appear In the U.
The badweatfcerChaa handicapped
the team here as they hare had so
practice this week and unless the
weather changes they will have none.

Is as follews: Fry, Sd; Osborne, 1st

here from the territories- of the cen

teged diminution in the number of resi

rate incidental to tho hardships the

ridiculous.

words when they gathered here today
for the opening session under former
President William Howard Taft, but
that was the Idea they wanted to

"We believe," said Herbert S. Hous

inent member of the league, "that
permanent International peace la a
business proposition that -has to be
organized and pushed through by men
with red blood in their veins just as
anything else that Is worth while has
to be handled.
"Permanent peace means a great
deal to the business Interest of the
world and they are behind this organi
sation, heart, soul and body,
"There is nothing visionary about
the plans of this league. There
are no dreamers in it. Look at the
lists and ( think you will agree that
they contain the names of big men
who do things in a big" way."
