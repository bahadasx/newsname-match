PROSPERITY WEEK
WILL BE OBSERVED
Prosperity that pleasant condi
tion so much wanted-- does not mean
much to the majority of us when It
la confined to a select few. Pros
perity and good times In New York
City may mean very little to the
people of Oregon or New Mexico or
some other distant section of the
country, but home prosperity, com
munity growth and development are
things that vitally interest and
touch every person regardless o' hut
business or vocation or where he
may live.
Everyone desires prosperity, the
home brand of prosperity, the kind
that all may participate in, and with
the thought of arousing prosperity
throughout the nation, the week of
June 12-17, 1916, has been designat
ed by the National Association of
Merchants Trade Journal Headers,
an Incorporated society composed of
individuals from practically every
community of over 500 population In
the United States, as Meno- Prosperi
ty Week. The term "arousing pros
perity" is used by this association
advisedly, as prosperity is in reality
a thing to be moused.
We can imagine no more distress
ing sight than to see a beautiful com
plexion disappearing with the per
spiration on a hot summer day.
WEISER GAS WELL
PROSPECTS GOOD

P"X hoi a well of undoubted eoni-
merolal value In the conservative
opinion of nil those hest qunllflod to
Judge who have vlalted the well since
the last flow was struck at a depth
of 420 feet about 11 o'clock Friday.
A second flow had been tapped Thurs
day evening, this had been capped
and a premium gsugn put on the pipe.
About 6:30 Friday morning the
pressure had accumulated to such an
extent that the cap blew off and resi
dents of that part of town thought
another earthquake or some other
cnlnmlty waa at hand. As soon as
the pressure became normal drilling
was resumed and a few feet farther
down the present flow waa tapped
All at once the drillers heard a rush
ing, roaring noise, and a moment
later the ruah of gas came throwing
water, sand and gravel 75 feet or
more In the air. This flow was not
only much larger than the previous
one but the pressure was much great
er, so that It has been necessary to
let the gas escape constantly An

On both Friday and Saturday even

the well and gated at the big blase.
B. Kutoh, manager for the com
pany, aays that the one well as it now
stands will furnish more than enough
gas to supply the number of consum
er required under the franchise
granted by the city and he la confi
dent that a greater supply la not far
distant. But even If this should not
be true a half doxen wells like this
one would not only supply the entire
city for domeetlc purposes but leave
an adequate aupply for manufactur
ing purposes a well. Welaer Amer

LITTLE INTEREST TAKEN
IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION
Vote Light in Country Precincts-Republicans
Name a Winning Ticket
In the primary election last week
the reel Interest from a national
standpoint was the vote for the pres-
denUa nominee
Whlle seversl
favorite sons paraded from one end
of the. state to the other, the majori
ty of the people hsd made up their
minda that Hughes waa the proper
man to receive the nomination and
he received a very large vote, with
out even signifying that he would ac
cept the nomination. When a man
has a nomination thrust upon him
by the people of the whole country It
means something, especially when no
one but the people want that man.
The thousands of .Irillsra hslns
fluenco on the people.
Will R. King received a nice vote
In his home county aid will be elect
ed. W. H. Brooke seems to be elected
for delegate to the national republi
can convention.
For secretary of state the voter
dnclsred for Olcott, the present In
cumbent.
For public utility commissioner It
looks like Corey, of Salem. If Cor
ey la selected It la to be regretted for
several reason. Corey ha reetded
t Salem for twelve year and Is not
In touch or sympathy with the east
ern side of the state and therefor
not qualified to give the people of
this section what thev are entitled
to. We believe It would have been
better If the people had selected a
bona fide resident of the district as
the law providea.
For the county office the vote by
the republican was so great that It
would seem only the republican nom
inee would have any show this fall.

returns by precincts and you can

STOCKMEN EAGER
EOR RANGE LANDS
W. E. Davidson of the Oregon A
Western Colonisation company was
here for a short time Tuesday, chock
ing up the local office of the com
pany and arranging for the platting
of the new townalte of Bendler.
Mr. Davidson says there ha been
a great deal of Inquiry for their
range lands and they have sold fifty
Motion line he waa here a few
week ago and have Inquiries for
a many more. The stock men are
realising that they are up against It
for range and are buying up these
cheap lands to protect themselves.
They have quite a lot of range lands
left In this county, but In Hsrney
and Crook It Is going ery rapidly.
Many of the cattle men and sheep
men buying these lands have rklers
keeping trespassers off and the man
without range Is going to be up
against It another year.
Mr. Welttenhlller met Mr. David
son here and they were In consults
lion over the work of platting the
new toii of Bendler. The work Is
being rushed with a large crew of
men.
Mr Davidson stated that it had
been definitely decided to build a line
from Bend to I'rlnevllle this season

MM
DOCTOR TAKES POST
Ontario Got Hospital Main
ly Because of His Un
tiring: Efforts.
It .liiroh Pr tiling has gone eaat
again for post graduate course in
the hospital at Rochester, Minnesota,
run hy the Mayo Brother, who are
i acknowledged as the greatest and
most up to date surgeons in the
world. All the phystclsns employed
are specialists and the best that can
be hired.
Whenever we are reminded that
the Doctor Is taking another post
graduate course we naturally think
of the great benefit these are to the
people of thl entire section, a all
afflicted are benefitted by the know
ledge the Doctor brings Into the
community.
Another thought In this connection
Is the hospltsl, because Dr. Printing
hsd more to do in the bringing of
this great Intsltutlon to Ontario than
any other one person. We some
times wonder If the people realise
that the hospital save soma sixty
to seventy thousand dollars annual
ly to th community and also pro
longs the lives of many people. Up
to the preeent there have bean nearly
thirty operations at the hospital this
month, twenty of these were major
operations and ten minor, or at least
that would be an average. If the
people had to go to Boise or Baker
for theee operation It would mean
at least 1260 each for th major oper
ations and 100 each for the minor
one. Then there are the scores who
are there at all time for the excel
lent treatment and nursing to be had,
totalling over six thousand dollar a
month that la kept in the community.
Some of these people would not be
able to have treatment If they had to
puy out the cash for It, as would be
necessary If compelled to go away
for the work, and another large per
cent would have to borrow the mon
ey if compelled to go away, aa It Is
all these people are accommodated at
home. Thus Is ovr seventy thous
and dollars kept In the community
snd distributed to the business men
and farmers for the necessary sup
plies to run the hospital
Where Is there another man of
sufficient public spirit to bring an
other Institution to this city that will
be worth even half aa much to us?
BAKER CITY NEEDS
MORE SKILLED LABOR
Baker. Or., May 22. Because of
the great rush of building In this
city contractors are compelled to
seek outside for skilled labor. Every
available man Is working, and many
carpenters and painters have been
brought from Portland Contractors
.nim i i that the starting of the work
on the 1126,000 high school build
Ing, as well aa the 1100,000 In rest
iiinl stores outlined for th
summer will call for even more men
The demand for workers in the
mining and lumber fields Is still
keeping up, although many high
school boys have just been put to
work.
CHEESE FACTORY RE OPENED
The Parma co-operative cheese
factory was recently reopened for
business und about 4000 pound-. of
milk is being received dully. The

6000 pounds of milk w:ll be received
