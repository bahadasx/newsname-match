I
Sacrifice for Books.
Ifadellen Sweeny JliUei. ia
pitu
burg Christian Advocate.
A country's culture is genuine
only when her peoyle are willing
to endure sacrifice fbf the sate of
good books, and no man is truly
educated until he is willing to
forego some of life's necessities
for the luxury of a worthy book.
Consider Francis Asbury, for ex
ample, swinging around his three-thousand-miles
circuit always sa
ving room in his saddlebags for
the Bible and one or two other
volumes, and employing his scan
ty leisure so admirably that he
was able to read and make notes
on scores of ponderous volumes.
We wonder how this apostle to
the American wilderness of the
eighteenth century was able to
manage it, but such entries as
the following in his invaluable
journal explain the fact: "My
present mode of conduct is to
read about a hundred pages a
day." And ag&in, "Arose the
next morning at five, though
very weak, and'spent a great
part of the day in reading and
writing."
' Another great reader of this
century of expansion wfienj a
min Franklin. Thesfpry of his
early sacrifices for the.sake of se
curing books is familiar to the
youngest of Us, and it was this
youthful impulse that helped his
father ia his decision to make of
him a printer, little guessing that
his trade this trade would be the
entree to a public career of dis
tinction and Uje introduction to
the contemporary citizens of the
world.
But what of the present gener
ations on this subject? Perpaps
it is no longer necessary for us to
deny ourselves for the sake of the
books. Let us see. rubhc libra
ries have placed at the disposal
. of almost every individual more
volumes of the world's great lit
erature than he is able to master.
The sacrifice of money, then, is
absolete; but what about time?
A man must be willing to give up
an extra round of golf and a wo
man an added strip of fillet cro
chet if they are to be considered
eligible to the title of "literati."
Formerly it was a matter of flnd
fng sufficient books to fill the lei
sure hours; today the difficulty is
to find enough leisure hours for
the books we ought to read.
Written literature originated in
the longing of roan to immortal
ize his thought life. "0 that my
words were now written!" ex
claims Job. "0 that they were
written in a book! That with an
iron pen and lead they were gra
ven in the rock forever." And
out of the instinct books have
evolved through the self-denial
and sacrifice of their authors.
The cost of a volume is not meas
ured by the amount you pay for
it at the stationer's, but the ac
tual amount "of what we call
life," as Stevenson says, "which
goes into it" Especially is this
true today, when authors are
standing on the far-flung battle
line in Europe, risking their very
blood for the sake of the words
that they shall write.
To be sure, "of making many
books there is no end, and much
study is a weariness of the flesh.'
And never was this statement
more significant in its truth than
" today, when the market is being
burdened with all manner of
works. But at the same time it
is true that there has .never been
so many "centrifugal" forces
pulling us away from "the bliss
of solitude." As Mabie says in his
'8tudv Fire", the man who goes
to books instead of life; who gets
thia knowledge of humanity out
j "of Shakespeare and of nature out
pi Wordsworth, will never know
jlther profoundly." But as he
jontlnudq: iXothiog so redeems
Advertising to too Riscoo.
The value of advertising .is to
build up trade, to sell goods, to
secure a patronage. Mendonot
spend money on advertising for
the joy of it, but to get results.
And many a bad business, many
a poor business, has been set on
its tegs again by judicious and
timely advertising.
Theodore Roosevelt knows this
for he is an advertiser. So do
his friends of the "Roosevelt Non
partisan League" which has
headquarters at 12 Vanderbilt
Avenue, Nw York City. And
that league has gone o adver
tising Theodore Roosevelt with
might and main, telling that he
is the man whom this country
should elect President, of course
desiring as the first step that the
Republicans should nominate
him, for the Progressives are on
ly waiting their convention to
do their turn in a like perform
ance. We fail to see how there could
be a "Roosevelt Non-Partisan
League," for the Colonel is parti
san even "from the rising of the
sun to the going down thereof,"
but anyway this "Roosevelt Non
Partisan League" is spending
real money in advertising and
sending out literature to boost
the Colonel. Evidently it finds
that the Roosevelt business is on
a decline and needs advertising
to get patronage. At any rate
the "League" is sending out a
booklet on "Roosevelt's Peace
Record" and in the current issue
of the Saturday Evening Post it
has three pages of display adver
tising telling why the Colonel's
friends think he should be elec
ted President.
This advertisement of the Col
onel as a candidate for President
is a new program in political pub
licity. Space for display adver
tising in the Post costs, we be
lieve 4,000 a page, and as tbe
Roosevelt league uses three pa
ges there is an expenditure of
12,000.' That shows that the
Colonel's friends are out after
business for hiin, and are in dead
earnest in their plan to get him
in the running. And the adver
tising shows also that they are
a bit scared, for iu place of wait
ing for the nomination to chase
the Colonel they are hot footing
after it for him. And don't you
think that T. R. does not know
what they are doing. He is too
wise a Gaucharo bird for any
thing like that. But it is likely
to be money well invested in jock
eying for tiie Colonel in the race.
Colonel Roosevelt is, of course,
too modest and timid to say
right out in the open that he is
on the chase after the nomina
tion. That would not be in line
with his "heroic" balderdash. So
up hops, skips, and jumps the
"Roosevelt Non-Partisan Lea
gue" evidently with a man's size
barrel, and does the thing for the
Colonel. It doe not disguise its
designs, it does not hide behind
secret reading matter, but with
its display advertising it announ-
n . t ft a

Nut Prohibitioi Ltfislatioi.
Already the Anti saloon League
forces of North Carolina have
mapped out the program of leg
islation they propose to put
through the next General Assem
bly. The Board of Trustees of
the League at its last meeting
decided to make an effort to se
cure the followinglegislationthis
year:
1. To prohibit club and other
public places from storing or
keeping liquor for beverage pur
poses. 2. To prohibit the advertising
of liquor in any way, even to the
sale of papers that do advertise
it.
3. To prohibit the sale, or
manufacture for sale, of wine and
hard cider.
4. To prohibit the delivery of
liquor by public carriers and the
receipt of the same.
5. To make it unlawful for
anyone to have in possession, for
any purpose, more than one-half
gallon of spirituous liquor.
6. To provide for the seizure
and the confiscation of any prop
erty automobile, wagon or any
thing else used in transferring
liquor for illegal purposes. .
The Board of Trustees, in its
report, further says: "We re
quest the citizens of the State in
every voting precinct to call upon
their candidates for the General
Assembly to declare themselves
on this question, and we urge the
Christian voters to see to it that
such members of the General As
sembly are elected as will stand
for this measure. We instruct
our Superintendent to so organ
ize the State and carry this cam
paign into all the counties that
we shall be assured of the pass
age of this measure by the next
General Assembly."
In a letter Bent out by Super
intendent R. L. Davis of the
Anti-Saloon League we find him
making a strong appeal for the
reforms advocated. He says:
"Now that the policy of our or
ganization has been declared, it
remains for the workers to get
busy and carry it into effect.
The legislation asked tor is in
keeping with the various tem
perance reports and resolutions
that have been passed, in the last
twelve months, by the churches
in their annual gatherings and,
therefore it is confidently expect
ed that the church folk will line
up solidly behind the Ati-Saloon
Leage in working for this legis
lation. Let the prohibitionists of
the various counties get togeth
er in this matter and, in keeping
with the suggestion of the Board
of Trustees, elect to the General
Assembly men that will pass leg
islation above outlined, the pas
sage of which will be a death
blow to "John Barleycorn."
Rockefeller Beneficiici.
The General Education Board,
founded by John D. Rockefeller
"to iiromote education within
the United States," without dis
tinction of race, sex orcreed,.will
shortly issue its complete an
nual report for the fiscal year
1914-1915.
The first installment of that
report shows that since its or
ganization and up to June 30,
1915, the Board has appropria
ted directly $16,862,147.71. Of
this amount $10,848,084.07 had
been paid out, and $6,014,063.
64 was awaiting requisition. Up.
to that date the Board had ap
propriated its entire accumula
ted income with the exception of
$198,992.35.
The report shows the value of
the Board's resources, supplied
by Mr. John D Rockefeller to be
$33,958,848.40, of which $30,
918,063.80 is general endow
ment and $3,010,78160 reserve
fund. '
The cross income from these
funds for 1915 was $2,230,425
41. In addition, the Auna T.
Jeanes Fund, which is adminis
tered by the Board, yielded an
income of $7,910.46. The ad
ministration of these funds is in
the hands of a Board of Trus
tees consisting of Fredrick T.
Gates, chairman; Walter II. Page
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Albert
Shaw, Wallace Buttrick, Starr J.

Husbands for War Widows.
Baltimore American.
The announcement that comes
by way of Pittsburg to the effect
that the Salvation Army of the
United States and Canada, co-op
erating with the Canadian gov
ernment, will undertake upon a
large promotive scale to obtain
good husbands for the allied wo
men widowed by the European
war arouses the interest even of
those who may doubt the practi
cability of such a scheme. The
situation of millions of compar
atively young women widowed
by the terrible war is too tragi
cally pathetic to permit of thesa
beiug any numerous Buggestive
ness about the proposal to find
for them husbands in parts of the
earth where, as the census tables
indicate, the men outnumber the
women. The probability of the
Kcheme is doubtful because the
war widows are so many that
the supply is likely to be far be
yond the West Canada and Wes
tern United States demand.
It is over and again made ap
parent, however, in the far-reaching
complexities of our modem
civilization, that there is need of
some trustworthy agency, oper
ating on a large and general
scale, tor the promotion of mat
rimony. The devastations of
the great wai accentuate this
need in the countries involved in
the war. In fact, providing for
the war widows, even to the ex
tent of assisting them to find
husbands, is going to be one of
th after problems of the war for
every country involved iu tbe
destructive carnage.
rutting of matrimony upon a
card index bureau basis may
seem to take the ronuinie out of
the preliminaries to marriage.
But, 'knowing as vq do how
disastrously romantically ar
ranged marriage often turn out,
we should not be tx hasty in
deciding against any honest, and
tni8tworth scheme for bringing
about matrimonial unions in a
way ha,t reduces the romance to
a minimum that expedites the
conjunction. It is to be assumed
that each of the contracting par
ties will be allowed at least a
look-over of the other before the
parson ties the knot.

Hoe Handle Remedy.
State Board ot Health Bulletin.
"Hoe-handle medicine" is about
the best remedy that can be pre
scribed this time of the year for
about three fourths of all the
common ailments. It will prove
beneficial to chronic grouchiness
and "spring fever," and no less
effective to sluggish livers, poor
appetites, after-effects of coUb
and grips and the general run
down condition in which winter
usually leaves the body. It is
said that in ones own back yard
garden lies the solution of
one's own peculiar problem. In
other words, worry, in all its
various forms, when taken to the
garden vanishes in the open air
and sunshine.
"The "garden cure" is especial
ly reccomended for the mental
and physical condition so char
acteristic of the spring: that
makes you feel that you are only
half alive that tiled feeling that
the patent medicine literature
talks so knowingly about. ' And
it's this same tired feeling which
tbe patent medicine sellers have
been so successful in appealing
to what makes the spring time
their golden harvest time. Ton
ics and. teas thatourgrandmoth-
ers used to give for this condit
ion had at least one virtue,
they were harmless, but it not
so with their successors the pat
ent medicines. The majority .of
the cures that have replaced tbe
herb brew and the root contain
either alcohol or opiates, but
probably their worst fault is tbat
they raise false hopes, waste
precious time andgethardearned
money all under false claims.
However, the day of the patent
ed medicine fakir is believed to
be about over and disease and
health are coming to be dealt
with throughout honest, practi
cal methods.
The "garden cure" has a num
ber of features to reccomend it,
and its most valuable, perhaps,
is exercise in the open air and the
time spent in the sunshine. Then
there's "garden sass" that is
grown tbat is the best of spring
tonics, especially when included
in the daily bill of fare. Early
spring greens and garden vege
tables and less meats and heavy
foods will go a long way toward
avoiding "spring fever" and that
"let down feeling."
