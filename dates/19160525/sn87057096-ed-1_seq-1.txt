Some Excitement at lecatur.
Decatur City was considerably
worked up last Friday over another
reported attempted burglary, as
there have been several burglaries in
that town recently. A few weeks
ago C. R. Meeker's general store was
entered, and more recently R.
Little's drug store was entered and
robbed of about $165.00 in money
and checks, the burglar entering
through a rear window which had
been opened during the day, and it
was a window which was never open
ed, being fastened with a catch, and
the tracks in the dust showed that
was the manner in which the burglar
entered the store. Last Thursday
night S. H. Campbell heard someone
in the rear of Creal & Son's hard
ware store, and lie arose and went
out and notified the nightwatch and
several parties heard one or more
persons leaving from the rear of the
store. On Friday a bloodhound was
secured from Creston and used on
the trail, and it is reported that the
dog made several trips direct from
the rear of the hardware store to the
home of a resident of Decatur City,
who when questioned said he had
been there the previous evening pick
ing up boards for kindling. There
have been no arrests, but consider
able talk has been indulged in by
the people of Decatur.

llouglit Another $85,000 Farm.

has been investing so heavily in good
j-»ecatur county farms, closed up the

est, if not the largest owner of farm
lands in Decatur county.
Has Taken a Claim in Wyoming.
We are in receipt of a letter from

Appreciated Our Good Roads.
Everybody knows that C. M. Akes

Bob Akes Was doing a fine job of

Bob a dollar and remarked that this
was the best road he had struck in

return to Des Moines on the 2:30

and he said it was necessary that
something be done concerning high
taxes. After the conclusion of his
talk Frank VV. Dusey, a retired civil
engineer and laud owner of Creston,
made quite an extended talk on the
doings of the legislature and the
highway commission, in which he ad
vocated the abolishment of the com
mission, and objected to the state
college at Ames teiling the farmers
how to farm and how to build roads.
He said lie was dead against the
Ames bunch. A number oi those
present propounded question to Mr.
Dusey in regard to permanent roads
and other questions which he answer
ed as he saw them.
The work of perfecting a perma
nent organization was then taken up,

ternoon. The district convention for
the 26th district was held at Cory
don Monday, and twenty-three autos
filled with Knights left Leon at

the K. of P. band. On arriving at
the outskirts of Corydon the band
alighted and the Knights except one
man in each car to drive formed in
line and marched to the square, and
they broke up the convention for the
time being. The Corydon boys did
not know the band was coming and
had no idea such a large delegation
of the Knights from Leon would at
tend, but they were equal to the oc
casion and the Leon boys say they
were entertained in royal fashion, a
fine banquet being served by the
Corydon ladies in the big rest room
building in the evening. The boys
all returned home that night, but a
few were caught in the shower be
fore reaching Leon.

More "War Prosperity."
A Leon automobile company has
'sold 100 automobiles this year, and
the season has hardly started. Deca
tur county has a population of 17,148
and this auto company's territory
covers just one-third of the county.
In other words they have sold 100
cars in this period of democratic hard
times in a territory inhabited by less
than 6,000 people. Doutless other
brands of automobiles have been sold
in the same territory, which makes
us suspect that these Decatur county
people must also be getting rich off
the European war.—Bloomtield Dem

A very pleasant and quiet wedding
took place last Wednesday afternoon,
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Chas.

united in marriage. Only a few of
tlie immeuiate relatives of the con
tracting parties were present to wit
ness the ceremony. They were made'
one by the ring ceremony, Rev. E. F.
Partridge officiating, after which the
hostess served a delicious luncheon.
The bride was formerly of Leon
but for the past year has been teach

house west of Lamoni. The groom is
well known to our readers, being the

their married life on the groom's
farm near Mt. Zion.—Lamoni Chron

Tuesday of this week Sammy Pal
mer, living in the Tennessee neigh
borhood, met with a very severe acci
dent. While sawing wood his hand
became caught between the stick he
was sawing and the saw and the re
sult is the loss of two fingers on
the left hand. Drs. Mitchell and Carr
were called and rendered the neces
sary medical and surgical aid and
Sammy is resting as easy as a fel
low could under the circumstances.
This is certainly a hard streak cf
luck for Mr. Palmer as it will put
him out of commission on the farm
for several weeks—right when his as
sistance is most sorely needed.—
