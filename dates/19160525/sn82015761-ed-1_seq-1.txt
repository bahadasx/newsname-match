BAND GIVES EXCELLENT
OPEN AIR CONCERT
The Barnes Boys Band gave a
most excellent open air concert at
the band stand, last Sunday even
ing. The concert began at six
o'clock and lasted for an hour.
About ten selections and pieces
were played aud each was extreme
ly well tendered. The concert as a
whole showed excellent work by
the boys and competent instruction
by Mr. Barnes.
Altho all of the concert was of
the first order, the selection "II
Trovatore" brot forth the greatest
number of favorable comments.
This is a very difficult piece and yet
it was played with as great per
fection as one hears with most
bands in much larger cities.
Williams is proud of her band.
Both Mr. Barnes and the boys
deserve every enco uragement.

NORTH ENTHUSIASTIC
OVER SUDAN GRASS
From the amount of seed being
bought in northern Arizona this
year, Sudan grass will take a pro
minent place among forage crops."
It was tried out last year by two
farmers near Grand Canyon with
very satisfactory results. One
homesteader whose land is at an
altitude of 6J0O feet planted 7
acres about May 15th, 3 acres of
which was newly broken sod. It
was planted in rows 3 feet apart
u-ino a grain drill with part of the
outlets covered, 4 lbs. of seed to
the acre were planted.
With one cultivation the grass
grew to an average of 5 feet, pro
ducing 1 tons to the acre, the sod
land not producing so heavily as
the old land. It made most suc
culent hay, the horses, cattle and
pigs eating it up clean.

THE DUAL CONVENTION
The progressives have chosen the
same time and place for holding
their national convention, as the
Republican party has, which is
Chicago, June 7th. It seems to be
a pretty well settled plan of the
Progressive party, to get to work
early and nominate Theodore
Roosevelt for President of the
United'States and then, set back
and proceed to moke a lot of the
George V. Perkins 25 cent, all
Havana cigars and watch the re
publican convention nominate the
same: Of course George W. Per
kins is the. pay-master General and
envoy extraordinary as well as
plenipotentiary of the progressive
party, and several other things as
well, which space will, not permit
us to print.

JERRY DOFFIELD
FIRST THIS WEEK
Jerry Duffield has again mount
ed to the position of first in the
Boy's Contest. His present score
is 1950. During the week he
landed one new subscription
which scored him 200 points and
two year renewals each scoring
one hundred points. This made
him an increase of four hundred
points for the week.
The work of Eugene Smith is
worthy of comment, also. He
has continued the same consist
ent work which has character
ized his progress during the en
tire contest. Starting two weeks
later than the other contestants
he has finally crept up to second
place and indications are that he
is going to stay there and he is
very likely to head the list in
another week.
There is no reason for the
other contestants to become dis
couraged. Each has a good
chance of heading the list but
they will have to work consist
ently if they do so.
Contestants Notice!
The rules of the contest re
quire that each contestant re
port each week.
Each of the
contestants has failed to report
on some one or more weeks.
For that reason the contest must
be prolonged as announced last
week or some other concession
made. I want each of you con
testants to report at the News
Office Friday (tomorrow ) after
noon, just after school, and we
will talk this matter over.
