Germans Oak French Have Evaci' d Dead Man's Hill
For 72 Hours fighting Was Carried On Hand to Hand In
Dark Caverns of the Trenches-Seven Thousand Dead
On Seven Hundred Yard Front-Ground Covered With
Corpses and Neither Side Can Reach Wounded
Tragic Scenes In World's Greatest Battle
Every man in a French force penetrating Fort
Douaumont killed.
Soldiers fighting in dark underground tunnels,
using hand searchlights, knives and bombs.
Hundreds of French and Germans buried alive in
the wrecking of subterranean works.
Scores of men driven insane by the lust of
butchery.
Surgeons, amputating legs and arms without
anaesthetics, report the wounded continuing their
struggle with knives, although unable to stand.
A French captain reported seven thousand dead
heaped along a seven hundred yard front.
Berlin, May 25. With the bloodiest fighting in all his
tory the giant German nutcracker is closing in on Verdun
today. Its right jaw has advanced on a front of three
miles during the past seventy-two hours.
After sacrificing more than one entire army corps in
rn effort to retain the Dead Man's hill position, northwest
of Verdun, the French evacuated the whole stronghold.
Hill 304, cornerstone of the French defense west of the
Meuse, is held jointly by French and Germans.
Further slight advances b ythe Germans in ravines on
cither side will force its surrender to the right wing of
the German army. The left jaw of the Teuton machine
lias entirely reconquered positions temporarily surren
dered to French troops.
It is-estimated thirty thousand men died fighting in' the
dark, underground caverns about the ruins of Douaumont
for 72 hours, with no resultant change in the battle line.
Positive denial is made of French claims that General
ITiville's forces even temporarily occupied the ruins of
Fort Douaumont. The only French detachment that en
tered the fort was completely wiped out, declared the
Berlin war office. , "
On the southern and western approaches to the fort
(the earth is covered with countless corpses and many
wounded, crawling feebly about hunting shelter and aid.
Since the French attacked last Sunday there has been no
lull in the savage struggle and neither side has been able
to reach its wounded.
West of the Meuse, French troops are being steadily
driven back upon the Verdun forts. The German center,'
which took Dead Man's hill, has not yet occupied all
abandoned works because French artillery is still playing
on its southern ridges.

Germans are strongly attacking. They
took a French trench north of Haudro
mont quarry on the enst side of the riv
er. Violent artillery fighting con
tinued nil night, but there were no
important infantry struggles, either
around Douamount or the Dead Man's
bill front.
The French gain was made in a small
wood between the river and Cumieres.
The positions won would be exposed
to a German flanking attack if French
forces attempted to push on southwnrd
to Cumieres. Southern exits to Cum
ieres are under French artillery fire,
so there is no fear of an assault from
that quarter.
General Nlvelle ha made no attempt
to seize Fort Douaumont during the
night. Through complete exhaustion of
the infantrymen, operations on both
sides have temporarily halted.
French military critics are agreed
that the weeks finhting has been blood
iest in history. The German lost more
than in my of the war's previous bat
tles. Exhaustion Causes Halt.
London, May 25. IHter exhaustion
of the human element in the great
fighting machines struggling for mas
tery at Verdun brought a lull today in
the savage buttle.
The frightful slaughter at Fort Dou
aumont came to a halt with the works
in German hands. During the night
French troops made no effort to wrest
it from the Bavarians.
Minor fighting proceeded today with
slight advantage to both sides.
While the men rest in their trenches,
however, the tremendous artillery en
gagement is still raging with appalling
violence.

TEXAS MILITIAMEN TO
Secretary of War Baker
Changes Opinion After Ex
amining New Law
Washington, May 25. Reversing his
decision of yesterday, Secretary of
War Biker announced today he would
call a court-martial to try the cases of
110 Texas militiamen charged with
failing to present themselves for bor
der duty.
Baker's reversal was due to the dis
covery of legnl points in the new army
bill which would not obviate the oath
required of the Texas militiamen that
they defend the constitution jnd obey
the orders of the Texns governor. No
mention was made of feal.y to the
president's orders.
Under these- circumstances Judge
Advocate General C'rowder bolives the
ne,v army bill does not render the mi
litia law void. The offense of fail
ure to present themselves at muster is
not wiped out. The validity of their
reasons for so doing will bo decided
at the court-martial.

WILSON AS PEACEMAKER
NOT PLEASING TO THEM
If President Proposes Peace

of Europe
isy Carl Y. Ackerman
(lnited Press staff cnriospucdriit)
Berlin, May 25. German officials
cherish no hopes of an early ond to the
war, despite peace talk in Washington,
Berlin and London. Great interest is
manifested here, however, in President
Wilson's speech at me Mecklenburg
declaration of independence celebn-
tion. It won wide notice in the Ger
man press.
I'incinls believe that, although they
think England is tired of ino war,
Franco will exert such pressure as to
prevent peace until aucr expected
allied offensive.
Conservative German newspapers do
not relish the idei of Wilson as a
peacemaker. The Lokal Anzeiger said
todav: "'Wilson must prove a change
in his attitude b demanding and en
forcing respect for international law
by our foes before undertaking the
more difficult role.

By Carl D. Groat
("United Press Htuff cnrvrsnnnilenn
Washington. Mw when Presi-1

will act in behalf of all Europe and not
of a single group of nations. This was
told callers at the White House today,
and may cover his address next Satur
d ly before the League to Enforce
Peace.
The president discussed his position
freely, indicating that ho was basing
his attuudc on a vast amount of infor
mation from various sources, lie did
not disclose anything forecasting an
immediate step in behalf of pence.
It is understood tint the president is
favorable to the proposition of having
congress pass a resolution providing for
tho calling of a conference of all na
tions subsequent to the war, to adopt
plans preventing a recurrence of hos
tilities. Of 626 Jurors Examined Only
Four Are Passed Fme
Legal Vaudeville
Waukegan, II., May 25. Only four
jurors for tho murder trial of William
H. Orpet have been obtained from a
total of G20 men examined, and the
trial dragged today. Judge Donnelly,
angered at comments on the proceed
ings, imposed Bilence on both the state
and the defense.
Tho parents of Marian Lambert, tho
dead girl, will be called as witnesses
for the defense, it was learned today.
This will be done in an attempt to
prove that Marian was afflicted with
heriditnry insanity, and that she had
a suicidal mania and suffered from
hallucinations. The defense will claim
that she poisoned herself while obsessed
with one of these hallucinations.
Taken unawares by this unexpected
attack, the state vainly tried to save a
number of jurors who had been tempo
rarily pajised ,but wa unable to do so
against the new fire of defense ques
tions and the box wag nearly emptied.

BODY OF-mSTEUII
THE
JEHHHGS HII
Is Discovered In Pile of Brush
One Mile From Scene of
Murder
HE HAD BEEN KILLED BY
HEAVY BLOW ON HEAD
Discovery Throws No Light
On the Identity of the
Murderer
Fortland, Ore, May 25. The body of
Fred Ristman, missing jitnenr in the
Jennings murder mystery, was found
this morning in a thicket of brush a
mile from tho Gore homestead where-
Mrs. Helen C. Jennings was killed while
sho slopt Monday night, May 15.
Ristman evidently had been killed by
a heavy blow on the head The body
was louna by deputy sheriffs from
Portland near where Sheriff Hurlburt
yesterday found one of Ristman '
gloves. A farmer picked the glove up
in the rood the day after the murder
and hung it on a fence post.
The finding of Kistmnn's body is the
most important bit of evidence discov
ered, since the murder, but it throws
little light on tho identity of the mur
derer. Monday night, May 15, a stranger
hired Ristman to take him to Sherwood.
17 miles from Portland. Ristman did
not return tho next day and a search
ing party was organized. Lute Tues
day ins diooii BTiuneii auiomoinie wns;
found near the Gore homestead where
Mrs. Helen C. Jennings, a prominent
Portland-divofcee, livvd alone.
The bouse was entered and Mrs. Jen
nings' body was found in bod. Her
skull had been crushed by a terrifie
blow from a slcdgo hammer, which lay
Uesido the bed.
A qimrtor o'f a milo down the road
Ristman 's hnt, a lap robe, and torn
piocca of a shirt were found. All were
blood stained. Pieces of brain were
clinging to the lnp rone.
Possos scoured the woods and dragged:
and dynamited tho Tualatin river for
Kistmnn's body. They searched only
aiong tho main road, however. The
spot whero Ristman 's body wns found
today was near a by-road back of the
Goro homcstend.
Bennett Thompson, nn ex-convict.
known to havo visited Mrs. Jennings
frequently, wns arrested the day after
the murder was discovered. Ho offered
no resistance nnd steadfastly denied
any knowlcdgo of the crime. His alster-
in-law asserts that Thompson was in
hor house during all of Monday night
when the murder wns committed.
Thompson hired a lawyer, nssertedl
that he can prove a complete alibi, anil
has maintained a discreet silence ever
sinco. No charges have been filed
against him.
The motive for the crime is nnde-
cided.
Ristman 's body was lying face down
ward in an open space in tho brush.
Tho coat was pulled over tho back of
his neck, leading officers to believe
that the body had been dragged by tho
shouldcrB.
The bnek o'f the bV.uII had been ernsh-
ed by a heavy blow. The condition of
the body confirmed the belief of of
ficers that the mysterious passenger in
the back seat of the tnxicab hilled the
driver as he snt at the wheel.
