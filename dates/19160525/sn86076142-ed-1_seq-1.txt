.ZURICH, Switzerland, May 25.
The government of Saxony has decid
ed to take over complete eentroFof
the generation and distribution of elec
tricity in the state. Coal' fields and
one big generating station have al
ready been acquired, and the Saxon
Landtag has Just voted several mil
lion dollars for further outlays. Even
tually It Is expected that therhole
electrical supply in the kingdom will
be taken from the state system so
that the government will, be able to
fix the lowest possible charges. At
the same time the government has no
intention of preventing local public
bodies or private corporations and In
dividuals from producing 4 their own
electrical power. , - t t
As a beginning, the gover,itiot has
purchased for 11,250,000, the stream
generating station at Hihschfelde on
the river Neisse, belonging to a Ber
lin company, This station baa al
ready a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts
and the plant is quite new. Moreover,
It is close to one of the coal fields
bought by the state. Later the govern
ment will erect new works near the
western coal fields, wnere there are
already stations with which negotia
tions are now going on to arrange the
necessary co-operation.

Japan has announced
The activity and strength displayed
recently by Rochester Merger is of
especial interest, inasmuch as It is
practically a Tonopah corporation, a
portion of the ground at one time, be
fore any considerable amount of de
velopment was done, been under op

The proven worth of tbis security
Is most largely due to the efforts of
C. H. Mcintosh, a former attorney of
Tonopah'" He went into Rochester
when the camp was a puling In
fant, arriving there December 20, 1912.
On that day he purchased 15 claims
and two tractions, all undeveloped!
ground. A night letter was sent to To
nopah demanding that a . certain
amount of money be placed In a bank
to his credit and no questions asked
He said be would explain later by
letter.
Charley Ducheneau got the wire and
he read it right and downside up and
then from left to right and right to
left. "Hum." he said, "I wonder what
Bert has up his sleeve this time, but
I'll take a chance." He mentioned the
wire to Jack McQuillan," Eddie Roth

Ross Condon and several others,
Each said they wanted to .get in blind
and the result was that a liberal sum
of money was deposited to Mr. Mcln-
tosh's checking account before he was
out of bed next morning. -
This money was expended In paying
for the claims and doing preliminary
work. Three companies were formed,
Rochester Belmont Mining company,
Crown Point Extension Mining com
pany and Original Rochester Mines
company, the ground bounding the
Rochester Mining company on the
north, west and south. -It
was pretty hard sledding at first,
money not being obtainable for silver
I mine exploitation. Finally the three
i companies were united under the
name of the Rochester Merger Mtnes
company and the total capitalization
of $4,000,000 was reduced just fifty
per cent. Eight or nine months ago
money for exploitation became avail
able and a considerable amount ot
treasury stock of the original 580,000
shares was disposed of for develop
