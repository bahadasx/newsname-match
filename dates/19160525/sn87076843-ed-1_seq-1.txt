SOME OBSERVATIONS
Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.

We trust Henry's next peace ex

If ignorance is bliss, a whole lot

Indiana, the mother of vice-presidents,

If some of the movie theatres
would label their films "For the
Prurient" it would mean the same
thing as "No Children Admitted."
One of the residents of Madison,
Wis., left that city $1,000,000 for
public improvements. This is an
other kind of "Wisconsin idea, but
a good one. If anything like that
should happen in Perrysburg some
of the fellows who arc always
placed on the "Soliciting Commit

have heart failure.

boy who used to roll hoops ?
Please, Mr. "Weatherman, don't

Trouble about peace in Mexico is
that all those generals would have

One Hundredth Anniversary of An
Important Event.
By Dwigiit R. Ganfiixd
Before going further with the
history of this community, it will
be interesting to know some thimrs
that antedate the beginnings of this
village many years; and that, rela
tive of the inhabitants and early
titles to this land.
In 1G70, LaSalle made a trin
along the Maumec river on an ex
ploring expedition into the interior,
and on this account France laid
claim to this valley. The French
title here remained good up until
the French and Indian war in 1759,
or a period of about ninety years,
during which time no one disputed
French occupation. In 1759. Eng
land wrested this country from,
trance, and this domain then be
came English. England held the
title here till 1783, a period of
twenty-four years, at which time
the Revolution closed when it
passed under the control of the
Stars and Stripes.
During the period of French oc
cupation, many French explorers
and traders visited these narts. es
tablished trading posts, associated
with the Indians, often taking to
wife Indian women, which in a time
gave rise to many persons known as
"Half Breeds." These traders and
Half-Breeds roamed the country
over at will and their summer lodg
ings and winter cabins dotted the
river banks and forest depths.
From the English colonies in the
east there soon appeared rivals to
this squatter occupation, and so our
valley here after some years con
tained a mixed population of naif
Breeds, French, Indians and Eng
lish colonists. Thus it was at the
close of the revolution in 1783.
After the revolution, settlers
from the east began to flock to this
western country for the nurnoso of
acquiring land and tilling the soil.
kittle is known of the historv of
these squatters except that they
were here when the real "West
ward Ho" march of progress be
gan.
The tendancy of the English emi
grants was to form little villages
along or near the river to be a pro
tection from hostile Indians who
frequently menaced their settle
ments. 'Thus "Orleans" down mi
the "Flats" near Ft. Meiirs was
built in an early day. Orleans' his
tory commences before the siege of
Ft. Meigs in 1813, and it was the
one only bright spot in this intense
wilderness that existed for miles
around.
It would be difficult to say ex
actly the date that "Orleans" be
came what might bo styled a set
tlement. But history has recorded
that as early as 1810, which was
prior to the war, there were many
families near the present site of Ft.
Meigs, and in fact all along the
river. Amos Spafford who held
the position of Collector of Cus
toms and Postmaster at the foot of
the Rapids, was the leading pio
neer as early as 1810. Others
mentioned were: Bob, David and
Andrew Race, Jesse Skinner, Cy
rus Hitchcock, Dan Murray, Sam
uel Merritt and many others with
their families. These settlers were
engaged in .building cabins, testing
and tilling the soil and watching
the development of what they ex
pected would bo bloodshed at the

and consternation reigned;, for,
knowing that war had beeii de
clared, they lived in dread of the

fielding game and hitting the ball
hard. Homier carried awav the
honors with three hits with three
times at bat. F. Rcis, Harper and

IMPORTANT DECISION '
The court of appeals has handed
down its decision in the case of
Minnie Chapman vs the Board of
County Commissioners affirming
decision of the court of common
pleas. This case was a damage suit
brought by plaintiff for injuries al
leged to have been sustained be
cause of a defective approach to a
bridge along the Maumee river
road. The common pleas court
held and the court of appeals re
peats that the legislature has pro
vided that approaches to bridges
shall be cared for by the township
trustees where the cost of such
care does not exceed .$50 and held
that in this case tho evident cost
of repairing the approach would
not have exceeded that sum.
Hence, it was held that, if the
plaintiff had any legal right to
claim damages, she must look to
tho township trustees and not to
tiie county commissioners.
LAME BACK
Lame'back is usually due to rheu
matism of tho muscles of the back.
Hard working people are most likely
to suffer from it. Relief mav be had
by massaging the back with Chamber

day. Try it. For sale by all dealers.
