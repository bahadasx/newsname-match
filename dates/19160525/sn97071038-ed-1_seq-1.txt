T. J. Humph rcyg ol the Humphreys
Drug Co., came out victor In the
three-cornered race for the republi
can nomination for county treasurer
at the primary election last Friday.
In many of the precincts It was nip
and tuck, while In others, one of the
three had a walk-away.. The results
show that Humphreys carried 9 out
of 17 precincts, Borg 6 and Wilklns
2. The final result was Humphrey
391, Borg 246 and Wilklns 176.
It developed that both 0. A. Bleak
man and E. L. Padberg stand strong
with their home folks. Bleakman,
In his home precinct, Dairy, got near
ly all the votes. He received 110 and
Mr. Padberg received 5. Likewise In
South lone, Mr. Padberg's home pre
cinct, the present county commission
er received 90 votes while Mr. Bleak
man got only 3. The result totaled
457 votes for Padberg and 332 for
Bleakman. Padberg carried 12 pre
cincts and Bleakman 5.
For endorsement for county clerk,
J. A. Waters beat Fred Tash 680 to
244 and has the distinction of carry
ing every precinct in the county. The
closest result was in Dairy precinct
(Hard man) where the final count
was 58 to 59 in favor of Waters. Mr.
Tash formerly lived lu this precinct.
The republican party did not care
to give anything to Herbert W. Cope-
land, who sought the nomination for
county school superintendent. The
result of the race between Copeland
and Lena Snell Shurie reveals the
only real land Blide of the election
The slide was so complete that the
socialistic eye doctor has not been
lieard of since. TJie result was,
Copeland 120, Mrs. Shurte 576.
George McDuffee -was unopposed
for BherifT nomination and received
the high complimentary vote of 718,
more than ony other one candidate
received. Loy M. Turner, unopposed,
received a total of 716 votes and S,
E. Not son for district attorney, was
the recipient of 708 votes. M. L. Case
received Ills party's endorsement for
coroner. For county central com
mitteemen, the following were nomin
ated: Paul Rletmann, North lone,
J. T. Knappenberg, South lone; C. E.
Wood&on, Mt. Vernon; T. J. Mahoncy

try precinct.
Only about half of the 1500 regis
tered voters appeared at the polls on
Friday to exercise their rights and
privileclges. Why this lack of in
terest prevailed is inexplalnablo.
We predict a greater interest in the
November election.
The democratic election In this
county was a tame affair. Besides
nominating Jeff Jones for sheriff and
Hanson Hughes for treasurer, the
democrats also endorsed J. A. Waters
for clerk, Mrs. Lena Snell Shurte for
school superintendent, S. E. Notson
for district attorney and Loy M. Tur
ner for surveyor. .
About 155 votes were cast by the
Democrats In this county, Woodrow
Wilson having received that many.

101151 SCENE
OF 1GH ACTIVITY
The week has been a busy one, up
to date, with the pupils of the lone
schools, all the fuss and hub bub be
ing incident to the closing days, when
it is now considered the proper thing
to have "something doing" other than
close .attention to studies, the last
"week. So both teachers and sti"
dents have been hard pressed In the
preparation of special exercises and
the presenting of diplomas. The first
order was the graduation of the pu
pils from the eighth grade on Fri
day evening. For this event the
Yeoman hall was very appropriately
decorated with green boughs and lo
cust blossoms, and over the stage
stood out in striking lotters the class
motto: "Our Hope, to Win Our
Aim, Success," From this depart
ment of the school class of twelve
bright boys and girls have graduated,
and each one has received their pa
pers permitting them to pass on into
the High School grades. An appro
priate program, especially prepared
for the occasion, was carried out as
follows:
Music LIone Orchestra
Invocation .Re J. L. Jones
Vocal Solo l.-Mlss Doris Wilt
Oration 'Eighth Grade Graduate"
Jean Davis.
Vocal Solo Zelma Engelman
Essay, "Early Oregon," Mary Bacon
Bell Solo ; ..Chas. Chick
Address Prof. Lyman
Benediction ..Rev. Jones
The presentation of diplomas at
this time was postponed owing to the
fact that the grades of the pupils had
not been received.
We should be pleased to comment
at length on this program, as it was
very excellent throughout. These
eighth grade pupils will be heard of
as they progress in the higher grades,
and it would be indeed a pleasant fact
to chronicle in the future their grad
uation as a class from the High
School without a break in their num
bers. The hall was crowded to wit
ness these exercises.
Friday evening came the class play,
Blundering Billy," offered by the
members of the Senior class to a
packed house. The cast was as fol
lows: Billy Butler, Harley Sperry,
who carried out the character of
Blundering Billy" In a very natural
and satisfactory manner, always do
ing the wrong thing at the right
time; Ezra Tuttle, Colorado cattle
man having a large fortune and a
beautiful daughter, and very desirous
of breaking into swell society. This
at the last moment, owing to the' se
vere illness of Jesse Dobyns; Lieut.
Griswold, Mearl Blake, a handsome
young soldier seeking the hand of the
cattleman's daughter somewhat of
an adventurer and the rival of
"Blundering Billy; Mr. Blake did his
part well; Sing Toy, Chinese servant
who looked the past as well as acting
it to the delight of all, proving to bo
just about as big a blunder as Billy;
Hank Dibble, a sailor boy, George
Zink, who did not seem to appreciate
the 'love-making of the grass-widow,
from his own account; Dorthy Tuttle,
pretty daughter of Ezra Tuttle, who
was determined to marry the man
of her own choice and foiled the
schemes of her father and the lieute
nant. This was the part played by
Catherine Jones, who thoroughly
comprehended the character and
greatly pleased the audience; Clarissa
Burnham, beautiful grass widow and
adventuress, former wife of Liet.
Griswold, was the part well sustained
by Ruth Petteys, and Woyo San,
Japanese girl, was played by Goldle
Stoops, who might have been taken
for a real lady of the Flowery King
dom. The play was well presented

the festival center, where 80,000
square feet will be given over to a
magnificent floral display featuring
the Electrical Rose Fountain.
The festival queen is to be crowned
the evening of June 6 at 8 p. m. This
will enable the ruler of the fiesta to
ride crowned in the children's parade
the morning of June 7.
. Since there will be thousands of
visitors in Portland several days be
fore the opening of the show, the fes
tival center will be thrown open at

Queen will receive the keys of the
city from Mayor Albee an hour later

ganization will consist of more than
40 pieces and will be heard in con
cert at the festival center. Other

Olcott Endorsed For Secretary of
State and H. H. Corey, of Salem.
Wins Nomination Over Ed
Wright For Public Service
Commissioner.
Chas. E. Hughes of New York, and
a member of the Supreme court bench
of the United States, received the Re
publican nomination in Oregon for
president, getting a majority of the
votes cast. Albert B. Cummins, of
Iowa, was second and Theodore E.
Burton, of Ohio, a poor third. The
result of the election in Oregon has
added a great impetus to the Hughes
boom In the East and he Is now con
sidered a stronger, although ever the
same silent candidate for the great
national convention next month in
Chicago.
In Morrow county Justice Hughes
carried, with but one exception, ev
ery precinct. The exception was Irrl
gon, which went for Cummins 13 to
11 with only one vote for Burton.
His majority over the state will ex
ceed 15,000. Theodore E. Roosevelt
has received the progressive endorse
ment. ,
Ben W. Olcott, present incumbent.
won over Chas. B. Moores, the other
republican candidate for the secre
tary of state nomination by 15,009
votes. In Morrow county Olcott re
ceived 362 votes to his opponent's
333.
As predicted before the primaries,
the closest race developed in the con
test for the public service nomination.
H. H. Corey, present secretary of the
commission, has apparently won out
over Ed Wright, of La Grande, hia
nearest opponent. The others fin
ished in order named, McCulloch,
Kyle, Service and Rusk. In Morrow
county Wright was first with 162,
Kyle second with 153 and Service
third with 136. Corey received 94
voteg, McCulloch 77 and Rusk 60.
Bei-1 Gurdane Loses His Car By Fire.
Berl Gurdane lost his Havre road
ter by fire on the road ten miles from
Wasco last Sunday. At the time of
the disaster, Mr. Gurdane was on his
way to The Dalles. After the fire had
completed its work there was nothing
left of the car but the two front
wheeles. Mr. Gurdane carried some
Insurance on the car so his loss Is
not a total one. He believes the fire
started under the engine. It devel
oped so suddenly that his trousers
were burned about his shoe tops be
fore he could slow down the car and
jump out. Mr. Gurdane has not yet
decided whether he will buy a new
car.
