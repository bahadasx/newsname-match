Stove pipes should atways filter
chimneys at proper distan es f-on
tellings or walls and at as -ieai
right angles as possible; tsns
should be d«>ne for the re-son Jr»l
where stove ptpOO enter iSUaUMjra
at other than a right angle, ihe'e ll
great danger of firo on roofs, orig
mating from spavKs. Be sure am
keep your roof free from moss.
These matters should have youi
attention is too much care cannot
be used in fire prevention meth
ods. It is one of the great prob
lems of the day and we urge yoi
to begin arith MM of the most ag
parent cv : 's, and at the same ;im<
or.c which will result in financial
