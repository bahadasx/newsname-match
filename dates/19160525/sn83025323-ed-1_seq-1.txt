IT RAINED
For some time past reports have
been coming in of rains all around
Malta, but it was not until yesterday
forenoon that the welcome drops
began falling in the city. And it
rained all day, not a few scattering
drops, but a steady downpour that
commenced about 10 a. mn. and con
tinued into the night. It was most
welcome and comes right when most
"needed to assist the growing crops.
" This dispels all thought of a dry
year and the dry land farmers in the
country tributary to Malta are about
the hapoiest bunch of farmers to be
* found anywhere. It is reported
that a big rain storm struck the sec
tion in the vicinity of Wooldridge
Tuesday night and all through the
8. Beaver creek country. This assures
* a big hay crop on the Beaver flat
which has always produced thous
ands of tons of the best blue joint on
n the market.
RIESISTEI) AN OFFICER
° No little excitement was caused
on Fifth Avenue Sunday afternoon
* when a well known character about
town refused to go to jail peaceably
* when Marshal Cosner requested him
* to. All day Sunday this fellow and a
gang of young sports had been
* painting the town and thinking they
were slipping one over on the city
* marshal. It went so far that the
one arrested said that the marshal
did not dare to run him in as he was
" some pumpkin around this little old
town. Marshal Cosner tried to get
him to along peaceably, but the fel
low made all the more noise and so
a warrant was sworn out and Jailer
Crabb and Marshal Cosner took the
culprit from his room and placed him
p in the Phillips county jail. The next
o morning in Judge Wilson's court
he pleaded not guilty to disturbing
the peace and resisting an officer
and was bound over for trial next
week and placed under bonds of
$1,000, which up to the time of go
T ing to press had not been forthcom
ing.
O It will behove some of the young
fellows who think they can run over
the police and do as they please in
Malta to take a lesson from this
poor misguided yap and hang on to
O themselves when inside the city lim
its, as Marshal Cosner says from
now on he is no respector of persons,
c regardless of who or what they are,
and will take pleasure in putting all
disturbers under lock and key.
"THE UNWRITTEN LAW."
"The Unwritten Law" which is to
be shown at the Bison theatre on May
27th, suggests the sensational type of
photodrama. It is sensational but
at the same time free from any taito.
of cheap sensationalism.
There is a fight, a personal en
counter between the hero and the
villian, and this scene is plentifully
provided with "punch."
There is a lurid fire endangering
the lives of a young mother and her
precious baby, while the husband
lying in the stupor of alcohol is
nearly devoured by the flames.
A wedding and a murder, night
life in the "family room" of a sordid
resort, and brilliant cabaret scenes.
Finally, there is the court room
scene, flawlessly presented, in which
the issue of the far-reaching plot are
brought to a logical and happy con
clusion.
These are some of the features
that are presented in the most real
istic picture in which the talented
emotional actress Beatriz Michelens
has yet appeared.

t IlE NEIBAUR FOR SHERIFF
D Ike Neibaur was in Malta this
r week looking over the field in the
e interests of his forthcoming candi
a dacy for sheriff of Phillips county.
t Mr. Neibaur informs us that a report
t has got in circulation that he had
g laid down in the race for sheriff
r and would not be a candidate at the
t primaries. Ike says this is all er
f ronu ous as he has never quit and
will not quit until the question is
I decided by the people at the fall pri
primary election. Mr. Neiblaur is
so well known in the county of Phil
r lips that he needs hardly any intro
1 duction. Among the old timers he
is held in the highest esteem and as
a nan whose word is as good as his
Sbond.
S ir. Neibaur made a good sheriff
fo Blaine county and was a great
Favorite in that county, numbering
his friends as largely in the Demo
trat party as in his own party and
we have yet to hear one word of re
proach against him from anyone.
ee is right in the race and says it
mtay seem a little early to toss his
tat in the ring. but nevereheless he
is not afraid to be the first one on
deck.
