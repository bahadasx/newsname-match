governments more than keep pace
with counties, cities, school districts
and townships in the increase in the
tax burden but that North Dakota is
an exception to this rule, is conclu
sively shown in the following table:

It Improves With Use
There is a delightful thrill in the smoothness with which
the Willys-Knight motor "picks up" without "choking"—
without the slightest vibration.
There is great satisfaction in being able to throttle
it down to a walking pace on high gear.
But the remarkable superiority of the Knight sleeve-1
valve motor lies in the fact that—
Though all other motors* grow noisy and lose power
and smoothness—
The Knight sleeve-valve motor grows steadily quieter
with use and increases steadily in power, smoothness and
all-around performance.
The factory's enormous production made it possible to
price this wonderful car at $1125 for the touring car, and
$1095 for the Roadster.
Ask us to tell you about the Willys-Knight.

From the above compilation it
will be seen that the increase in the
tax levy for state purposes has kept
almost oven pace with the increase in
population since statehood. On tile
other hand the county, city, school
and total tax have increased much
more rapidly than the population or
the state tax.
That the increase in the North Da
kota tax burden has not kept pace
with the wealth of the state is clearly
indicated by the phenominal increase
in bank deposits. While the bank
deposits are not entirely safe guides
as to the actual wealth of the state,
owing to the fact that a considerable
percentage of original deposits are
re-deposited, making a total some
what too large, yet as an indication
of the growth of the wealth of the
state, no safer or surer index could
be selected. Not only lias the cost
of the state government increased
much less rapidly in North Dakota
cnan the cost of local government,
but it is relatively much less than
in neighboring states.
On page 30 of the last biennial re
port of the state Tax Commission, is
to bo found a table showing the state
tax paid by a $1,000.00 of actual
value for several state. These statis
tics which follow were furnished the
Tax Commission by the officials of
the respective states included:

In the above compilation, while
the levy in mills in North Dakota la
high, the ratio of assessed to actual
value is the smallest of any state,
save Nebraska, of those included. In
this table the percentage of assessed
to actual value is used to find the
assessed valuation on $1,000.00 of
actual property, then the state levy
in ini!':-. i«. api-lief1 It. will BE .SCOP
that in North Dakotrl $1,000 oY ac
tual property only pays a state tax
of ninety cents, while in Indiana, for
instance, it pays a tax of $4.00 in
the state of Washington $3.50 and
in Arizona $6.50.
On page 31 of the same report is
found tile following table showing
the per1 capita cost of state govern
ment in several states:
Per Capita cost of State Government:
North Dakota $3.89
South Dakota 3.40
Arizona 7.08
California 5.66
Connecticut 4.89
Idaho 5.60

Massachusssetts .... 4.17
Michigan 4.42
Minnesota 6.43
Montana 5.40
Nevada 8.92
New York 7.44
Oregon 7.04
Washington 4.03
Wisconsin 4.43
It will be noted that of the states
included South Dakota is the only
one with a smaller per capita cost of
state government than North Dakota.
While in North Dakota the per capita
cost was found to be $3.S9, that of
Arizona was $7.08 that of Montana
$5.40 that of Minnesota $0.42 that
of Nevada $8.92 that of New York
$7.44 that of Oregon $7.04, clearly
indicating that the charge of extrava
gance against the state government
of North Dakota is unfounded. On
the other hand, all available statis
tics indicate that the state govern
ment of North Dakota is being ad
ministered in a most economic man
ner, and that the cost to each citizen
of the stale, for li's state government
is the lowest in the Union. On the
other hand our state educational in
stitutions, our public schools, our
charitable and penal institutions, and
the various branches of the state
government, executive, legislative
and judicial, are among the most
eflicient in The country, ranking verv
high.
On page 33 of the last biennial
report of the State Tax Commission
is to be found a table showing the
classification expenditures,
including the revenues received from
direct and indirect taxes in lines,
fees, forfeitures and from other en
dowment and interest funds:

The table indicates that
one-third of all expenditures are re
turned t.o the common schools that
the state educational institutions
claim almost one-fourth showing
that more than fifty-five per cent of
the expenditures of the state treasury
go to the aid of education. Adding
to this direct expenditure, such in
direct cost as the expense of the office
of the state superintendent of public
instruction and other agencies con
nected with the administration of
public schools, we find tha approxi
mately sixty per cent of all our ex
penditures go for educational pur
poses. More than twenty five per
cent goes to charitable and penal and
other institutions maintained by the
state.
The executive branch of the state
government, which includes all of
the state officials and all of the state
boards and their employees, spent
less than 7 1-2 per cent of the rev
enue flowing into the state. The
legislative expenditures for 1913 was
a trifle more than 2 1-2 per cent
the judicial arm of the state govern
ment, which includes the salaries and
expenses of the district judges, as
well as those of the supreme court
was somewhat less than 2 1-2 per
cent.
The wildest extravagance on the
part of the executive branch of the
state government would scarcely be
discernible in the average man's tax
bills. Indeed, if the entire state
government should run amuck, in
creasing expenditures by a wide
margin, it would scarcely be discern
ible in the average man's tax bill,
since the state government expends
in the neighborhood of ten per cent
of the tax levied for all purposes in
the state.
The increase in taxes for 1915 are
not due to any mismanagement
extravagance of the state govern
ment. The increase even in the
county and township taxes is very
much greater than in the state tax.
If the people of North Dakota desire
smaller tax bills they must look after
their county, city, school and town
ship tax levies, for if they were to
abolish the entire state government
it would not reduce their tax bills to
exceed ten per cent, while if they
were to abolish their local units of
government, their tax bills would be
reduced approximately ninety per
cent.

the one where good deeds done with

A Symbol of Health
The Py thagorians of Ancient Greece
ate simple faod, practiced temperance
and purity. As a badge they used the
live pointed star which they regarded
as a symbol of health. A red five
pointed star appears on eaoh package
of Chamberlain's Tablets, and still
fulfils its ancient mission as a symbol
of health. If you are troubled with
indigestion, biliousness or constipa
tion, get a package of these tablets
from your druggest. You will be sur
prised at the quick relief which they
afford. Obtainable everywhere.—Adv.
