TALK OF PEACE
MERE TVADDLE,
SAYS LORD GREY
Employment of U. S. Press
as Platform for Pourpar
lers Out of Question.
MAKES IMPROMPTU
SPEECH IN COMMONS
Replies to Arthur Pon
sonby; Conflict Hasn't
Reached Peace Stage.
LONDON, Maw 24. (10:35 p. m.)
In an impromptu speech in the
house of commons tonight on the
question of peace and the propriety of
"employing the American press us a
platform," subjects unexpectedly
raised by Arthur Ponsonby, Liberal
member for Stirling, Scutlund, In a
strong address attacking the govern
ment tor allowing diplomatic citquutto
to stand in the way of possible peaco
pourparlers. Sir Edward Grey, the
British foreign secretary, set aside all
ideas that peace negotiations were
possible at the prebent stago and
Plainly reiterated that the position of
the allies was in no way chanued. Sir
Edward declared it was Impossible to
consider terms of peace within a pre
vious agreement between the entente
allies. Further he expressed the do
cided opinion that the hostilities had
not yet reached a stage wnere n was
ooHHible to talk of Deuce, especially
as the German public was constantly
being "fed with lies" by tneir minis
ters. Mr. Ponsonby's reference to "the
use of the American press as a plat
form" was the outgrowth of a re
cent Interview with Sir Edward Grey.
Sir Edward, in replying to this at
tack, while admitting that Import
ant disclosure of policy ought first to
be made to parliament, argued that
a crisis might arise during the war
when considerations of etlquet should
not be allowed to stand in the way.
He contended that since German
vtatesmen constantly were giving in
terviews and statements to the
American press, it .would be mere
pedantry which would hinder British
statesmen from countering these
statements in the interests of their
own country.
What Are Abrogations?
Mr. Ponsonbv argued in favor of
countenancing peace possibilities and
against prolonging the war merely for
the sake of obligations to ureal Brit
ain's allies. The speaker said that
if the war had to be continued until
Constantinople fell or until the un
known obligations to allies were iui
filled, the country ought to be told
what those obligations are, and it
there was no essential differences be
tween Germany and Great Britain
and no such obligations, the govern
ment ought to take the earliest op
portunity to press for a termination
of the war.
Sir Edward Grey, In replying,
pointed out that his Interview con
tained no new declarations. He had
no prepared speech or statement to
make, but said if he thought the
German government or German opin
ion had reached the point where the
allied governments could bring a
peace compatible with their desires
nearer bv tnnking speeches about
peace, he would make dozens of them.
Hut the foreign minister added the
time has not yet arrived and the al
lies were bound by common obliga
tions not to put forward any terms
of peace except by mutual agree
ment. Atlaeks Policy.
Mr. Ponsonby strongly attacked the
government's diplomatic policy. He
said the peaco of Europe would de-
pend on the capacity of statesmen lor
surveying the great problems in a
broad spirit. The insularity which had
characterized British diplomacy in the
past constituted the real danger. The
government must realize that the war
had reached a deadlocK and at tne
same time the superior position of
Great Britain also must be recognised.
The latter was due to the spirit and
valor of the people and not to stares-
men. The speaker said he hoped the
statesmen were not going to imperil
the situation by delay and ineptitude.
Nothing had helped Germany more
than the extreme Jingo utterances of
responsible statesmen. They had en
abled Prussianism to keep Germany
together. Mr. Ponsonby said recrimi
nations must cease. He considered It
wanting in respect to the British peo
ple for the ministers to disregard par
liament and adopt the American press
as a platform.
The war would never end, Mr. Pon
sonby continued, if Great Britain
waited until Sir Edward Grey and Dr.
von Hollweg (the German imperial
chancellor! agreed as to who was re
sponsible for It. Had Germany re
fused to restore Belgium, evacuate
Vrance and Serbia and form an In
dependent Poland, had she refused to
agree to form an international council
to maintain European peace, Mr. Pon
sonby asked if she had refused these
things, the country ought to he told
James -Itamsay McDonald, labor
member, supported Mr. Ponsonby. He
declared that peace was a political
and not a military problem and that
it waa the duty of the government to
etate the terms on which it wus pre
pared to conclude peace.
A Ptrst-ClMM I.V. i
Sire Edward Grey in the course of
his speech characterised Ch-imielior
von Hethmann-Hollweg's recent state
ment that Great Britain was prepared
to git to war over i'osnla us "a first
clas lie." The real reason fT the
prolongation of the war was that the
German government was cnntniuully
telling their people that they were
v inning the war and that ihe allies
were beaten.
Sir Edward here made the declar
alien that the time for peace had not
yet arrived and that the enlente-al-
A WORD TO TIIK NATIONAL
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE.
Everybody In Oklahoma who la In
terested In the Republican national
committeeship through the matter
was settled by the state convention
except James A. Harris and a hand
ful of his henchmen. It has been the
custom in this state to select the na
tional committeeman in a state con
vention. Mr. Harris la the first to
attempt to go back of the returns
and repudiate the action of a Repub
lican Mate convention. For this rea
son if for no other he ought to be
thrown off the national committee,
a place which he gained by. stealth
and fraud to begin with. He should
not be permitted to participate the
preconvention deliberations. Ho Is not
a safe nor an honest Judgo of the mer;
Its or demerits of any political contro
versy, and would not hesitate to help
any political scoundrel steal a seat en
the committee or in the convention if
he thought ho could get assistances in
stealing a place for himself. The
Republicans of Oklahoma repudiated
htm four years ago and repeated the
dose again this year. His continua
tion on the national committee as a
member from this state will drive
thousands of Republicans from active
participation in the coming and sub
sequent campaigns. His election to
the committee will be an endorse
ment of the crookedest political
methods ever known In any state In
the union. Republicans in Oklahoma
can no longer make attacks on the
crooked methods of the Democratic
machine in this state and expect any
person of sound mind to give seri
ous consideration to their chat-ires.
and If the party locally docs not rise
up in unmistakable protest and repu
diate Mr. Harris and his methods,
should he be seated by the Republi
can national committee, the Repub
lican party In this state will deserve
to be regarded with the same degree
of opprobrium, If not greater, than
that which lies against the Demo
cratic party for the. Infamous and
brazen election fra'ids and thievery
which It has committed or permitted
to be committed In the past, and
which have done so much to bring
the elective franchise in this state
Into general and well-merited disre
pute. . Mr. Harris waa beaten fairly and
honestly In the most representative
stuto-wide convention over held In I
this state. He was similarly defeated
in every congressional dlstrjct con
vention save three. There are only
six delegates from this state that
have the slightest excuse for support
ing Harris for national committee
man, and even they, If they regard
the action of the state convention
with the proper consideration, are
absolved from even voting for him.
The two contested districts, the Sixth
and the Flftb, furnish splendid ex
amples of the Harris methods. The
record reeks with fraud and corrup
tion, and yet Harris' managers have
printed a brief of over six hundred
pages to. try and prove his case. In
the Sixth district he stole the dele
gation from Stevens county, and !t
was so rotten and palpable a fraud
that his own chairman of the con
gressional convention, ex-Governor
Furgerson, who waa slated for the
Harris candidate for chairman of the
state convention, refused to stand for
he place. In the Fifth district Har
ris was beaten In Oklahoma county
over two to one. That county abso
lutely controlled the district. Harris'
supporters bolted the Oklahoma
county convention and bribed the
chairman of the congressional com
mittee, whose vote seated the fraudu
lently elected Harrli delegation from
Oklahoma county, with a delegate
ship to the national convention. The
action of the Harris- supporters in
both of these districts is a disgrace
to the state and to the Republican
party. If. the national Republican
committee seats the Harris delegates
from the Sixth .md Fifth V.:-lrU t.
and he Is selected on the national com
mittee again, or prevents the election
of J. J. McGraw, the regularly and
duly elected national, committeeman
from Oklahoma, the Republican
party will be In worse shape In this
state than it has ever been. In the j
