Memorial Day Message.
Three years ago under hot skies a
few thousand white-haired old men
met on the grass-grown battlefield of
Gettysburg to celebrate a peace that
had endured for almost fifty years.
They were men who had fought each
other long and hard for what they be
lieved right; through a time of strife
and hatreds that seemed implacable,
through fire and blood and death, they
had lived to see peace come back to
the world. It ia a commonplace enough
reflection, perhaps, but it comes back
with a good deal of force this Memo
rial day, 1916. Peace comes back to
the world; hatreds die.
General Butler's Way.
Probably more stories were told
about Butler than of any other man in
the war unless, perhaps, it was
Grant. To Illustrate his habit of" do
ing things promptly and effectively,
an Incident is mentioned where a
newspaper correspondent called to ask
him for something that had to be writ
ten. Possibly it was a pass. At all
events, there was no place to write,
because the only table in the room

made for years to erect a finer build

still retains a characteristic beauty.
The slender plors and the overhanging
vines have lent an added attractive
ness to the original design.

Ill-Feellng Forgotten.
There were many men in '61 who did
not believe that the hatreds which en
gendered the Civil war could ever die.
There could be no peace. They lived to
see the thing they believed impossible.
They lived to see the South risen to
new greatness. They saw a nation

WHEN THE GREAT
T
PASSED IN REVIEW
PEAKING of his troops, who
passed in grand review at
. Washington at the close of the
- great war, General Sherman
says:
"It was, In my judgment, the most
magnificent army In existence 65,000
men, In splendid physique, who had
Just completed a march of nearly
2,000 miles in a hostile country, In
good drill, and who realized that tbey
were being closoly scrutinized by
thousands of their follow countrymen
and by foreigners. Division after dlvl
sion passed, each commander of an
army corps or division coming on
the stand during the passage of his
command to be presented to the presi
dent, cabinet and spectators. The
steadlneaa and firmness of tread, the
careful dress on the guides, the uni
form intervals between the companies,
all eyes directly to the front, and the
tattered and bullet-riven flags, fes
tooned with flowers, all attracted no
tice. Many good people up to that
time had looked upon our Western
army as a sort of a mob; but the world
then saw and recognized as a fact that
It was an army in the proper sense,
well organized, well commanded and
disciplined, and it was no wonder that
it bad swept through the South like a
tornado. For six hours and a half
that strong tread of the army of the
West resounded along Pennsylvania
avenue. Not a soul of that vast crowd
of spectators left his place, and when
General Sherman.
the rear of the column had passed by
thousands of spectators still lingered
to express their sense of confidence in
the strength , of a government which
could claim such an army."
The statistics of the Civil war are
highly interesting in view of what is
going on In Europe today. It has been
carefully figured out that there were
2,898,304 enlistments In the Union ar
mies during the war and approxi
mately 1,400,000 in the Confederate
armies. Reduced to the three-year
period there were the equivalent of
1,556,678 enlistments In the Union
armies and 1,082,119 in the Confeder
ate armies. The Union casualties were
67.058 killed in battle. 43,012 died of
wounds, 224,686 died from disease, 24,-
872 died from accidents and other
causes; total deaths, 359,528; total
wounded and recovered, 275,175. The
Confederates had 94,000 killed or dead
from wounds In battle and 164,000 lost
by disease or other causes.
Great Occasion Recalled.
The men who parade through the
streets of the country s cities and
towns on Memorial day do not ask to be
thought heroes. They are elderly citi
zens who In their day answered the
call Just as their sons and their sons'
sons would answer it if it came today.
The country gave the command, they
obeyed.
What makes the parade of these
men a great occasion is tne great
ness of the occasion which it com
memorates. Every one of the vet
erans Is a unit In the mass which
made up fifty years ago the utmost
strength of the greatest republic on
earth, exerted to save Itself from de
struction and to wipe out from It the
curse of human slavery.
It is impossible to exaggerate the
importance of the work which the
Union achieved for humanity or the
beauty of the self-sacrifice which the
soldiers of 1861 made for the Ideal of
liberty. It could not be easy for the
spectators in Pennsylvania avenue to
keep the tears from their eyes as tht
blue-dad ranks passed by.

Of General Interest
About Oregon
Oregon and California Land
Grant Title Is Not Clear
Washlntgon, D. C. As the Oregon
& California land grant bill stands on
the house calendar, it will not enable
the government of the United States
to pass a clear title to any settler or
purchaser, in the opinion of Repre
sentative Hawley, and he has the sup
porting opinion of several of the good
lawyers of the public lands committee
In this opinion.
"The bill," said Mr. Hawley,
"makes provision for the payment of
back taxes that is, for taxes that
have accrued for the past three years,
but I believe it does not provide for
the payment of taxes which are now
becoming collectable. Moreover, the
bill fails to make provision for the
payment of interest on back taxes and
fails also to provide for the payment
of penalties on those accrued taxes.
These omissions, in my opinion, render
it impossible for the United States to
give an absolutely clear title and I will
call attention to this shortcoming when
the bill is before the house.'
"The prime reason for providing in
the bill for the payment of back taxes
was to enable the government to give
clear title. Unless that section is
enlarged and made complete it will
fail of its purpose and those who ac
quire these lands from the government
will be liable for interest and for the
unpaid penalties and for the taxes that
are not paid by the government under
the Ferris bill."
Smudging Need Shown in
Southern Oregon Fruit District
Medford In the opinion of local
fruit men the year 1916 will mark the
final demonstration of the necessity of
crude oil smudging in the growing of
fine fruit and apples in Southern Ore
gon. At the beginning of the season there
was a distinct movement against
smudging, chiefly because of the an
noyance involved and damage to trees
from overflowing pots. In fact an in
junction against smudging was ob
tained by one group of orchards shortly
before the May freeze.
All this anti-smudge agitation is
ended now in the opinion of local grow
ers, for from May 8 to May 14 smudg
ing in Rogue River valley orchards
was worth at least $500,000.
Those orchardists who smudged, and
fortunately a large proportion of them
did, lost practically nothing from the
low temperature, while except on the
high hillsides those who did not
smudge were wiped out. While the
loss has been serious, it is certain ac
cording to experts who examined the
orcnaras tnat tne nrsc reports were
greatly exaggerated.
100,000 Acres in Willamette
Valley Can Be Watered
Salem Approximately 100,000 acres
of land can be feasibly irriagted in the
Wualmette vlaley at-the present time,
results of an investigation just com
pleted by the United States Reclama
tion Service in co-operation with the
state engineer's office show. A joint
report of the inquiry into irrigation
and power deveoplment possibilities of
the Willamette valley was issued this
week.
The survey extended from Canby at
the mouth of the Molalla river to the
head of the Willamette river above
Cottage Grove and included the area in
the immediate vicinity of Portland.
It is pointed out that the water sup
ply for the proposed irrigation of the
Valley lands in many cases may. be ob
tained from wells by pumping. The
report declares that the average econ
omic duty of water which seems to be
indicated for the valley as a whole is
eight inches delivered to the land,
varying with local conditions of soil
and crops.
Those employed in the survey inves
tigated the water power development
possibilities on the north fork of the J
Santiara river with storage at Marion
lake; the upper reaches of the Mc-
Kinzie river and the middle fork of
the Willamette river.
On the McKinzie river there are
two existing plants and at least two
new developments proposed, one at
Vida and the other between the outlet
of Clear lake and the mouth of Smith
river, involving the use of Clear lake
for regulation of flow.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT FRUSTRATES
EVASIONS IN INCOME REPORTS
Washington, D. C. Attempted
frauds and evasions of the income tax
law aggregating $8,880,185 have been
frustrated by the Treasury department,
it was announced Monday during the
first nine months of the current fiscal
year.
The $8,380,185 has been added by
the incorrect returns, assessed against
the delinquent corporations and indi
viduals and will be collected. What
ever additional evasions and omissions
may be uncovered in returns yet to be
investigated will be similarly treated.
More than 80,000 individual and cor
poration returns have yet to be exam
ined before the total of the amount
withheld can be ascertained.
Agents of the Internal Revenue bu
reau, working under the direction of
Commissioner Osborn, have for months
investigated all income tax returns
and will continue their work until
every one has been .checked and veri
fied. Tho investigation is said to have
disclosed that corporations have been
greater offenders than individuals. By
alleged evasion, omissions and direct
attempts to defraud, corporations
whose retunrs have thus far been ex
amined are said to have failed to de
clare their correct taxes to the extent
of $5,034,026, while individuals failed
by $3,346,159.
The general method of making in
correct returns, it is said, has been to
pad expense items, which are deducted
from gross receipts to determine net
income. Few corporations or individ
uals, it is said, understand their gross
incomes. Many are said to hav? add
ed tens of thousands of dollars to
their incomes of expense.
docks Moved One Hour
Forward Ail Over Britain
London Great Britain lost an hour
Sunday morning between 2 and 3
o'clock through the inauguration of
the daylight-saving experiment. Two
o'clock Sunday morning was chosen as
the time of the change on the repre
sentation of railroad companies, - as
fewer trains were then running. At
that hour clocks in stations, signal
boxes and telegraph offices throughout
thee ountry were changed by the men
in charge.
A few long-distance trains, which
were running at the time of the
change, arrived an hour late, but ar
rangements were made for connecting
trains at junctions to wait for them.
Time tables were not altered and
everything continued automatically as
usual.
The change was welcomed generally.
though there were some minor incon
veniences in London, when alterations
to thousands of public clocks began
and continued throughout the night.
The fact that neither France nor
America adpoted the scheme caused
novel complications in 'newspaper
offices, news from these countries hav
ing the appearance of being delayed an
hour.
The only opposition to the change
comes from the farmers in North
Hamptonshire, who at a meeting rec
ommended that the new system be ig
nored as far as possible in working
farms, but not to the extent of defy
ing the railroad time tables.
Bryan Attacks Saloons.
Atlantic City, N. J. William J,
Bryan was the principal speaker at a
meeting here Sunday under the au
spices of the Presbyterian General as
sembly which is holding its 128th an
nual convention in this city. Mr.
Bryan spoke for an hour, confining his
remarks chiefly to temperance.
"The most pathetic struggle in the
world," he declared, "is not that on
the battlefield, by men inured to hard
ships, but the mother struggling to
save her boy from the influence of the
saloon."
Referring briefly to the European
war, Mr. Bryan saia it was America's
duty to relieve the suffering on both
sides and "turn them like prodigal
sons away from the husks on which
they, feed and establish a world-wide
peace."
"Sport" Shirt "Immoral."
Elwood, Ind. The short skirt and
low-necked dress for women and
"sport" shirt for men were denounced
as immoral at Sunday's session of the
General Conference of the Holiness
Christian Church here.
An article of faith regarding dress,
made a part of the church discipline
for the ensuing four years, declares
that all members shall' seek to dress
"plainly, modestly and befitting a
Christian."
Turkish Plot Suspected.
Geneva, via Paris The Tribune's
Constantinople correspondent says it is
believed in Constantinople that a plot
is on foot to liberate ex-Sultan Abdul
Hamid and that his guards have been
greatly increased. The correspondent
adds that the pension of Abdul Hamid
has been reduced from 1000 to 250.
JUSTICE HUGHES
WINS IN OREGON
Presidential Aspirant Has Gear
Majority Over Opponents.
McARTHUR HOLDS BIG LEAD AT START
Olcott Leads Moores for Secretary of
State Cummins Second, Bur
ton Third-r-Few for L R.
Nearly every county of Oregon from
Multnomah county to the remotest cor
ners of the state has given Charles
Evans Hughes a substantial majority
over all other candidates for the Re
publican nomination for the Presi
dency. Returns from Oregon's state-wide
primary election Friday show conclu
sively that Justice Hughes is decidedly
the choice of Oregon Republicans for
the Chicago nomination next ' month.
He has a large majority over all other
candidates put together. Senator Al
bert B. Cummins, of Iowa, is running
second, and ex-Senator Burton, of
Ohio, third. ; .
Colonel Roosevelt has received only
a light vote. His name was written
in on the ballot by supporters in near
ly every county represented in the
early returns.
Ben W. Olcott maintained a strong
lead over Charles B. Moores for the
Republican nomination for sectertary
of state. Mr. Olcott is the incum
bent. For delegate-at-large to the National
convention there are seven leading
candidates, as follows: Cameron,
3924; Boyd, 3530; Carey, 3488; Ful
ton, 3326; Hawkins, 2913; Spencer,
2912; Ackerson, 2108; , Case,
1979; Peterson, 1876; Buland, 1793;
Warren, 1440; Morsley, 1362. The
situation is therefore left in doubt ex
cept apparently as to Cameron and
Fulton.
In the Second district, with two to
elect; the vote seems to favor Brooke,
with 493.
In the First district the incomplete
vote on delegates is as follows: Bis
hop 1307; Calkins 1142; Abraham
1133; Steeves 594.
W. C. Hawley and N. J. Sinnott,
Representatives in congress from the
First and Second districts, respective
ly, have been nominated to succeed
themselves without opposition. It ia
probable that they have received the
Democratic and Progressive nomina
tions as well. In the Third district,
comprised of Multnomah county, a
three-cornered fight was waged for
congressional honors. '
Complete returns from a few pre
cincts and incomplete returns from
virtually all the 375 precincts in Mult
nomah county at 3 :30 o'clock Saturday
morning indicate that the Republicans
of the have renominated C. N. Mo
Arthur for representative in congress.
A. W. Lafferty is running second;
E. V. Littlefied is far to the rear.
At that hour the returns gave Mr;
McArthura lead of 877 votes over
Lafferty, who in turn was 703 ahead -
of Littlefield.
McArthur's lead has been steadily
increasing since the first returns were
received.
George H. Burnett and Frank A.
Moore have been nominated to succeed
themselves on the Supreme bench, as
has John D. Micke for food and dairy
commissioner. They had no opposi
tion.
Hughes-Herrick Is Cry.
Chicago "Hughes and Herrick."
'HandH!" Catchy, isn't it, and
easy to remember.
Word of this combination comes to
Republican headquarters in Chicago
just after ex-President Taft had visit
ed Justice Hughes in Washington and
discussed with him his willingness to '
accept the Republican nomination for
President.
Mr. Taft and Myron T. Herrick, of
Ohio, are close political friends. As
President, Mr. Taft sent Mr. Merrick
to France as ambassador.
$700,000 Left to Music.
Chicago A trust fund of $700,000
to provide for the estabishment in Chi
cago of a great school of music, "for
the benefit not only of said city, but
of all America," was left to the Chi
cago Orchestral association by Bryan
Lathrop,' wealthy real estate broker.
The will was filed for probate and un
der its terms the income from the fund
would be used in establishing and
maintaining such a school : in connec
tion with the orchestra association.
