ELEVATOR FOR TU
CUMCARI ASSURED
A rousing meeting of business men this will bo used liy them to eongrc
was held at tho city hnll Inst night to ( gnto thnir whont there and then it Is
talk over the elevator proposition and ! proposed that it could ho freighted by
close a (icni wim mr. L,igni oi uiiicrui
Kansus. Mr. Light was here and Mr.
Petersen, special Rock Islund frleght
agent of Amarillo, wub nlso present.
It was definitely decided to buy tho
site decided upon by Mr. Light and u
committcu was choHcn to rniso the
amount necessary to pay for Hnme.
Sometime ago a different site was
.elected but there wns some difficulty
in making it the location, so another
was chosen in its stead which will cost
overal hundred dollars more. This
location meets with the approval of
every citizen of Tucumcnri and Mr.
Light believes it suitable, so the con
tract will bo closed within a few dayH
when the deed will be placed in e.i
rrow for the lots. The contract will
call for the operation of tho elevator
for at least five years. If Mr. Light or
Ids heirs, assigns or devisees fail to
operate the elevator for n period of
live years or more this land will di
vert back to those who donated it to
them. This makes all parties safe
and assures the citizens of Tucumcnri
they are dealing with men who undcr
tand their business and believe in
the future of Quoy county as a grain
producing country.
Mr. Light says work will be corn-
I . fit t - . t it. I
meuccd about June 1ft and a large ,
force of men will be employed so that
the elevator will be completed and
ready for sorvico before August 1st.
He arrived in Tucumcnri Tuesday
night and made another trip to the
wheat belt Wednesday. He says tho
prospects here are much better than
in Southwest Kansas and he is elated
at the flattering hopes of a bumper
eroj) this year. Rye is almost readv (
i or me nnrvesi ami wnciu is nv.cn
farther advanced than it was at this
time last year.
Money has already been raised with
which to improve tho roads to the
wheat belt. A date will be arranged
this week for a general road-working
dny at tho cap rock when the road up
that hill will be widened and made
safe for the hauling of large loads of
grain from the plains
The fnrmers on top of the cap are
desirous oi MUliuing a largo storage .

FRED WALTHER ANNOUNCES
Tho announcement of Fred Wnlthor
as a candidate for county commission
er from the 2nd district appears in
the News this week.
Mr. Walther is well known to tho
voters of Quay county und hns made
many friends during his term of of
fice . He has not been selfish in his
official duties but he has been econom
ical. He believes in dividing the road
money in such u way as to benefit tho
farmery and towns alike. He believes
in good roads and bridges and thinks
the plains people s'n. ulil bo given suit
able roads to market in order that they
may sell and deliver their products to
the best advantage. He ha been Til
cumcari's friend in every worthy prop
osition and believes that what bene
fits the county seat, benefits the citi
zens o! tho entire county. A number
j i i . t i . - t.j i i
in goon miiisinuiini iiruigcs nuvu ueen
looted in different parts of the coun
ty and he believes most of the road
money should be used in building good
.nibstantial roads making the bridges
valuable to the traveling public. A
good bridge without a road is about
ns useless as a wagon without some
motive power, anil Air. Walther is not
in favor of spending all tho money for
bridges and none on roads.
Mr. Wal titer's friends are strong for
him and believe his knowledge will be
of great assistance to the new com
missioners elected from the other dis
tricts this fall.
TUCUMCARI DEFEATS CLOVIS
Tho Clovis Elks enmo In cars to this
city Suturday and were entertained
by tho local Elks Saturday night and
Sunday.
Saturday night a dance was given
in their honor nt tho club rooms and
n large crowd was in attendance. Tho
quests wore royally taken care of and
tho dnnco lnstcd until after midnight.
Sunday nftornoon the Elks hnll team
from Clovis crossed bnts with the lo
cal Elks' team and tho score was 5 to
I in favor of Tucumcari. Somo good
players wore in tho line up for both
teams nnd a much hotter gamo thnn
lind been anticipated was played.
It is understood that another got
logother meeting will be held somc
whoro nenr this edge of tho Cap Rock
when tho Elks with their fnmilles will
meet with each other in an nll-dny
picnic. Well-filled baskets of edibles
will ho prepared nnd a big basket din
ner served on tho ground.
Ira Livingston wns up from Mon-
loyn Momlny meeting his many old
time friends und incidentally talking
a little politics,
one person by nuto truck or by n com
pany formed for that purpose. This
is not n bnd idea and perhaps Mr.
Light will be in a position to take this
matter up when he returns in a few
weeks. If this could bo accomplished
then the elevator here would be sure
of receiving all the wheat from the
main producing country which in about
twice ns much an was raised last year.
It now begins to look like Tucumcnri
and the farmers arc casting every
thing aside that is not for their mu
tual benefit.
Tucumcari business men hnvo shown
their willingness to help tho fnrnisr
and the farmer has misunderstood.
Now it is different and within a few
weeks the march to success and pros
perity will have begun and tho pro
cession will bo increased front time to
time. More wheat will bo put in next
year and Mr. Light has tho financial
backing to tako care of it in a business
way. He has been located in nnd near
Liberal for many years, has grown up
with the west and knows what he
is doing. He's mndo a success every
where he ha.i established an clevntor,
therefore success will bo hir. reward
hero.
Mr. Peterson is a booster and will
help us in anyway poiriiblc. Ho is de
sirous of prevailing upon eastern cap-
ital to build another fiber factory in
Tucumcari and will work In conjunc
tion with the local Chnmber of Com
merce in trying to land a factory of
this nature which will benefit more
people in Quay county than any other
one thing.
The meeting last night shows the
citizens of Quay county aro ready to
get together nnd do something in or
dcr to make this town and county
grow, and amount to something. One
of tho gentlemen present last night
said there was a man here who wns
only waiting to sco whether tho olo
vator would be built or not. He in
tended to invest in property if it was
built, but if it fell through he would
not invest in property. Now we have
landed the elevator and aro proud of
it there is no use stopping there.

LAS VEGAS WANTS
AN AUTO ROAD
INTO TUCUMGAR
Las Vegas, N. M May 21. Official
recognition and support of the pro
posed invnsion of Texas for the pur
pose of inviting tourists to come horo
over the automobilo highway from
Amarillo viaTucumcari has been plcdg
ed for the Commercial Club by its
board of directors. The club, believ
ing its advertising fund can be used
for no better purpose thnn an effort
to bring substantial summer visitors
here, decided to give n bonus of .$25
to each automobile owner who takes
his machine on the trip.
The newly formed automobile and
road association will work with the
club in getting up n party to make
the trip. It will log and sign the
highway between here and Amarillo
which eventually is to become a roc
ognized branch of the Colorado to the
Gulf highway. It also will provide
literature to be distributed in Toxns
regarding New Mexico roads and at
tractions, About 1)000 pieces will be
distributed.
O. L. Williams, who is president of
tlte Colorado to the Gulf Highway as
sociation, nnd who met with the club
directors, stated that during the tour-
ng season Inst your 5,000 cars passed
over tho rond bound from Texas to
Colorado points. He called attention
to tho fact that many of the Toxns
tourists are men of means, nnd if they
see attractive investments hero nre

DEMOCRATIC VOTES INCREASE
Snntn Fe, May HI. - The recent Dem
ocratic primaries in Clutves and Eddy
counties resulted in a showing of n
greatly increased Democratic strength I
and served to emphasize the oppor-!
tunity that this year confronts the
Democracy of New Mexico. In Chnvcs
county more thnn 2000 Democratic
votes were cast, or approximately
1000 more than the highest number
cast in the first state election, and In
Eddy county the total was close to
2100, or more than COO in excess of
the heaviest vote in 1011. At tho
presidential election in 1012. and the
congressional election in 1011, the vote
in both counties was les;i than Hint
cast for tho first state ticket. It is n
matter of record that many new vot
ers hnvo settled in other sections of
me state during tnc last lew years,!
and that increased democratic strength
likewise exists in several other coun-,
tics, among them Quay, Union, Roos
evelt, Curry, Colfnx and Gundnlupc.
In Santa Fe, a few dnys ago, Dr. J. J.
Shuler, mayor of Rnton, who so de
cisively whipped the Colfax county Re
publicans In the recent municipal elec
tion there, estimated tho additional
Democratic votes in that northern
county at from B00 to 700, and declar
ed that they would enable Colfax to
register heavily on the Democratic
side nt the November election. Ho
said: "The Democracy of Colfax coun
ty will be united this year, and it will
make its influence felt in the Novem
ber results."
To take advantage of the oppor
tunity presented by the increased vot
ing strength this yenr, elective work
on tho pnrt of Democratic county nnd
precinct organizations, and individual
co-operation on the part of the voters,
will bo necessary. Obvlouslv the ad
ditional Democratic voten will be val
ueless to the party unless they are de
posited nt the polls in November. In
Democrntic counties, where primnrv
nominations are equivalent to elec
tion, and where local interest ends
when these nominations nre made, ev
ery voter must realize that Democrat
ic principles and policies, national and
state, will he at stake in November.
TO END RECEIVERSHIP
Chicago, Mny 22 Completion of n
plan of reorganization which would
make, possible the immediate release
of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific-
rnilrond from the receivership undce
whlch it is opcrntcd is contained in n
brief filed today in the United State
district court at Milwaukee by so-(
licltors for debenture bondholders. If
the plan prevails it will forestall of-
forts of the so-called Pcnbody com-
mittee to dispose of the property nt
foreeJoseure snle.
The plnn contemplate the issue of
preferred stock for tho debenturo
bonds, having the same standing ns
preferred stock to be issued in roturn
for the assessment on the common
stock, except that the preferred for
the debentures will benr n six per cent
rate. The plan can be modified to
take cure of the first and refunding
mortgage bonds.
RAILROAD TO LAS VEGAS
Las Vegas, N. M., May 10. The di
rectors of the Commercial club learn
ed at their regular monthly meeting
this week that there Is a liklihood of
the Rock Nslnnd being extended from
Iucumcnri to Las Vegas, provided tho
IIIO
commercial interest of this community
and of Oklahoma City will work to
gether to secure such a desirable de
velopment. The directors wore in
formed that Oklahoma packers annu
ally arc handling larger quantities of
Now Mexico live-stock, nnd that they
are anxious to get into this section of
the state. They have been bringing
'omi! influence to bear upon the road
to extend its line to Las Vegns, und
nro of the belief that uction by busi
ness interests nnd cattlemen of this
section, co-opornting with action taken
in the Oklahoma metropolis, will bring
about the building of the extension.
The club, realizing the value of such
a line to Las Vegas, immediately will
take ii) tho matter of concerted ac
tion with Oklahoma City. Las Vegas
long has been anxious to bring Okla
homa business and tourists here, and
a Rock Island extension from Tucum
cari would help do it.

"You and God." He begnn with the
stntement that all Christendom needs

pastor present to his people the plun i
nnd ask them to vote pro and con ns I
to whethor the congregation would in
dorse ami co-operntc with such u plan
They did this and tho results were
most gratifying. Steps were taken nt
once to secure the strongest men pos

two most worthy men upon whom the
spirit of God rests. The ovnngcllst
is Rev. Arch C. Holder. Ph. 1).. of

,,V.U"
Rev. A. (' Holder is a man of rnre
natural endowment of person, head
and heart. His strong body, pleasing
appearance, clear ringing voice, bril
liant intellectual eyes, and graceful
motions mark him as a man of mag
netic person. The fiber of his brain
being the best, and thoroughly cul
tivnted enables him to make and sub-
CJect he expounds clear to all, even to
the youngest hearers. His sermons
are models of construction, scriptural
. nnd classical in thought and language,
and his illustrations move to tenrs
and uction the hnrdest sinners, Ho
I has tarried with God in the place of
' power."
Mr. Holdet has for his singer a
young young man oi unusual guts as

pre-eminently a teacher of vocul mu
sic. His voice is a rich baritone.
The date of the meeting is set for
June tho 18th next, und continues for
at least two weeks. The meeting will
be held under a large tent GOxlOO feet.
The success or failure of this meet

Friday where he was given n prelimi
nary hearing before A. A. Jones, the
Justice of the Peace.
The state put on n number of wit
