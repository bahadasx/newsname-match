Still, what do you know aUxit it? The thing is simply this:
The whole State Uoad Fund that may be on hand at the time tbe
apportionment is to be made shall le divided among the counties
having made provision for receiving such aid. by making appro
priations or voting bonds, according1 to the ratio the amount of tax
levied bears to the whole road fnud. but no county sball receive in
any one year more than 2 per cent, of the whole road fund. Mind
you 2 per cunt, of the whole State Road Fund and not 2 ier cent,

moneys appropriated tor imilding roads by said county. Ibis is
what the look says. Last year thin fund amounted to $747.51!.
Some of the counties got every cent they asked for, such as Boyle,
Bullitt. Grant and many others. The consoling thought is this,
when the county votes the bonds the State is bound in a contract
to pay her half some time, some way and she can't get out of it.
That is enough for me.
Why the informed opposition to the bond issue will try 'Ito

Mr. and Mrs. Fierce will go di

The bride is of attractive per

man, she is very popular in a
large circle of friends. She is
a daughter of Mrs. Julia Miles of
the Cochran apartments and for
mtrly lived in Marion Ky. Mr.
Pierce is a prominent business
man of Marion. The marriage is
the outcome of a childhood romance.
A wedding which surprised all
of Marion when it was consum

in Memphis, Tenn., was that of
Mr. C. J- Pierce, of this city to
Miss Laura Miles, of Paducah, a

the tax levy in the county under
consideration) the proportion is
as follows:
"SiOftUlO: 5717,51!):: A : X.
"After finding the value of X
for all counties, it was discover
ed that some had received more
than the 2 per cent limit provid
ed in the law, and some had re
ceived more than the amount of
their request Hence, after sat
isfying all the counties that
could be satisfied with the value
of X, it was found that a surplus
remained, which, when divided
among all the unsatisfied coun
ties, yielded the sum of $2,0,
which wa3 added to the original
value of X in each unsatisfied
county.
This addition satisfied quite a
few more counties, and again a
surplus was found, which, when
divided as before, yielded the
sum of 31 1 to be added to the
still unsatisfied counties. Once
more this operation was repeated.

the counties are setting aside
enough of their tax levy to jct
their apportioned amount, We
can do the same.
Now it is a fact that 103 coun
ties have nsked for state aid.
but, up to the time of this re
port, November 1, 1015, only 11
counties had voted bonds for
building roads: and, I think lam
safe in saying there are not more
than twenty-live counties in the
state of Kentucky to-day, float
ing bonds to build' roads. A
arge majority are receivine

property to get it. Is this not a
wise solution of the matter?
