CH!,.AG', May 2.'. The inter
m'ttent political buzzing of the past
fev works developed into a steady
hum today.
Indiana entered into the Conven
tion preliminaries with a whoop,
bringing in a large delegation to ac
tively promote the candidacy of
Charles W. Fairbanks. The day also
brought in the advance guard of
Llihu Hoot's representatives, headed
by John V. Dwight, former repuh

and immediately plunge into the
work of arranging a program for
the meeting of the national rommit

The Hoosier contingent was head

Mr. Goodrich was enthusiastic

"Fairbanks can carry Indiana
hands down." he said. "IUit there
i no assurance that any one else
can put over two republican sena

The exodus of republican repre

the plan of the democratic leadeis

ASSEMBLY FACES
SCHOOL PROBLEM
Auburn and M'Cormick Semi
naries May Assert In
dependence. International .Veivs Service:
ATLANTIC CITY. N. J.. May J5.
Confronted by a revolt of the .u
burn seminary and threats that the
McCormick seminary in Chicago
would assert its independence, the
bills and overtures committee of the
Presbyterian general assembly to
day shelved for one year the heresy
charge involving the Union Theolog
ical seminary of New York. The
committee recommended the ap
pointment of another committee to
inquire into the legal status of the
compact of between the as
sembly and Fnion seminary.
Pres't George p. Stuart of the
Auburn seminary arrived today to
press demands for the independence
if his school, seeking to h.nv it
placed on the same footing as the
I'nion seminary. He asserted that
the action taken by the general as
sembly in Rochester in 1 '.H f gave all
institutions the right to conduct their
own affairs. The report of the com
rdttce on the Union seminary mat
ter follows in part:
"We recommend that a special
committee of s'vrn. four elders and
three ministers, be appointed by the
moderator to take under considera
tion the questions th.it have been
raided as to the action of the gen
eral assembly of 1 : 1 ." retarding this
'compact of 7', especially as to
the hearing of this action upon the
legal status of all our seminaries and
also to investigate the whole subject
of the relationship of these sem
inaries to the church and to the as
sembly and to each either, to ;,;- ise
as to anv proceedings or actions
which may be neeessarv to safe
guard existing relationships, or to
make these relationships more se
cure, uniform and mutually helpful

Saving New York From Invader
Mexican Prisoners Brought
Back to Border; Sense Hostility
International News Servieo:
MARATHON. Texas. May 2S.
Dust-covered and weary, there came
into Marathon today Lieut. Col. Na
tividad Alvarez and Manuel Torres,
two of the Mexicans who raided
Glen Springs, attacked American
soldiers and carried away several
prisoners:, only to be in turn made
captives by the men they were
guarding. Alvarez in the heydey of
Francisco Villa's power, was a Mex
ican Peau Prummel, hut when he
reached here all evidence of his for
mer sartorical magnificence was
gone.
The prisoners were manacled to
each other. The truck in which
they were brought bark to the bor
der rolled up in front of the tent of
Capt. George P. Weicezorek and
stopped.
"Two prisoners, sir." announced a
sergeant of the eighth cavalry who
brought hack the Mexican captives.
"Guard them and notify the
sheriff." replied the captain.
Two logging chains with padlocks
were obtained from the quarter
master and the two men were chain
ed by the neck to the wheel of a
large tank wagon.
Dozens of curious artillerymen
crowded close, townspeople peered
between serried peaks of soldier
campaign hat. A deputy sheriff
took the prisoners' names, a cook
brought them food because he had
been ordered to and the Mexicans

were treated well because it is the
American army way of doing things,
but in all the eves that watched
there was not one glance of com
passion or .cvmpathy.
The Mexicans muttered to them
selves. They sensed the feeling of
the crowd and shivered more per
haps than a light east breeze from
the hills would warrant.
Then out from the shifting feet of
the crowd surrounding the prison
ers came a dog. He cringed as he
came into open space and slunk
along on his belly. He was a Pariah
and he knew it. He had been a
troop dog with 'he sixth cavalry,
but the sixth had gone to the Rio
Grande and abandoned him. He
sensed the lonesomeness of the two
prisom-rs and seemed to find a com
mon bond. Slowly he crept to where
the grimy hand of Alvarez nervous
ly clutched at a pebble. He touched
the hand with his nose, whined a bit
and lay still.
The captive bandit touched the
dog's head and turned to Torrez.
"Tengo un amigo." (just one
friend) was all he said, but his black
Mexican eyes snapped with a new
and softer lieht than the one of
sharp defiance he had saved for his
guards.
So the soldiers left them until the
sheriff came and the prisoners start
ed for Alpine. As the automobile
started east along the road the dog
loped after Alvarez.

WASHINGTON, May :'3.-Two
drciulnaughts. six battle cruisers and
a complete complement of auxil
iaries of all classes are demanded
immediately by the minority mem
bers of the house committee on
naval affairs. In a report to the;
house today the eight minority
members emphatically dissented
from the recommendations of the
majority, which they assert, is a
compromise, and made "without re
gard to the position of the Ameri
can navy." The minority insists that
a comprehensive program immedi
ately should be adopted which would
insure second place in point of
strength for the United States navy.
Ships and additional personnel
are urgently needed, it is asserted. (

Near-Perfect Baby
Is Best Show Has
Yet Produced
The '"absolutely perfct baby" haj
failed to put in its appearance at
the Baby show as yet, according to
the physicians making the examina
tions. There are many who approx
imate perfection and it may be pos
sible that the contest will pass with
out bringing to light any more per
fect than those already examin
ed. That should not be discourag
ing to mothers, however, for the ex
amination is so minute that it would
be a small imperfection, indeed, that
would fail to score against a babe.
However, numerous important im
perfections have been discovered by
some of the examiners, imperfec
tions which may be eliminated by
proper care and treatme nt. Some of
these defects are enlarged tonsils,
coated tongues indicative of stomach
trouble, retarded teething, imperfect
palatal arch, and other similar ills.
In the discovery of such defects the
baby contest is performing one of
its greatest missions among the ba
bies of South PenJ by giving the
parents knowledge or little ills
which if corrected in time may be
the mean? of saving the children
much future suffering.
The most important event of
Thursday morninc at the conference
was the advent of the first red
haired baby entered in 'he contest.

inations Thursday were Prs. Charles

International News Nervlee:
PAK IS, May 25. Petween Avo-
court wood and Port Douaumont.
northwest and northeast of Verdun,
across a front 20 miles wide, there
are a dozen ravines so choked with
dead tht ghastly barriers are form
ed by the corpses.
Never before has there been fight
ing of such ferocity as has been seen
during the past week upon the shell
torn hill slopes where half a million
German and French soldiers were
straining at each other's throats like
maniacs.
Purin;? the direct attacks and
counter-attacks of the past three
days and nights it is estimated that
the Germans lost a full corps in dead
and wounded. Particularly severe
were the German losses around Fort
Douaumont, which is again in Ger
man hands. With a callous disre
gard for human life that is incom
prehensible, the German legions
were sent forward in mass forma
tion, wave upon wave, into the cur
tain fire of the French artillery and
the infeino of machine gun fire.
The mighty artillery duel which
rages night and day over the en
tire Verdun front has made it im
possible to remove the dead and
some of the corpses have lain where
they fell in fighting a fortnight ago.
Shells Di Graves.
To the west of the Meuse. around
Hill No. 304 and Le Mort Homme,
where the concentrated fire of hun
dreds of German guns has been
concentrated for many days, shells
have sometimes acted the part of
grave diggers covering the corpses
with tons of earth thrown up by
their mighty explosions. Put too
often the bursting steel falling
among the mounds of dead, tears to
atoms the corpses adding to one
horror of battle which is sometimes
worse thin death itself.
Petween the lines soldiers, help
less from wounds, have died amidst
the fallen, the Red Cross workers
being unable to reach them for the;
artillery Are.
That the Germans are willing to
pay any price to take Verdun has
become fully apparent. No losses
are too high to vary the plan of tho
kaiser's rpneral staff.
lYcnch Save Men.
With the French it is different.
Dead Man's hill was given to save
the troops from being smothered
beneath the rain of projectiles which
the German gunners hurled against
the eminence day and night. Gen.
Nivelle. rather than incur the ex
treme losses which a prolonged de
fense of the hlil would have entail
ed, gave up the position, but even
yet the Germans have been unable
to organize a position on the crest
because of the sustained fire of the
French artillery.
Strong counter - attacks were
lunched by the French last night in
the region of Oumieres. it was stated
by the war oflice in the official com
munique. At the same time the Germans
were hurling troops against the
French position at Haudromont
quarry, of thf Meupf-
With the use of grenades the
French -were able to make progress
on the low ground lying between
Cumieres and the river, but further
to the east the Germans trained a
trench at Haudromont.
Ollioial Communique.
The text of the official com
munique follows:
"On the left bank of th Meuse
there was rather an intense artillery
duel in the sector of Hill No. as
well as on the 1 Mort Homme
Cumieres front. During the night we
made progress with a grenade at
tack in tne wood immediately east
of Cumieres village. The enemy
made no attempt to attack.
'On the right bank a stron- Ger
