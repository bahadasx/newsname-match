Diplomatic circles regard the recent tl
statements of President Poiucare and "
Sir Edward Grey as the oi>ening guns ei
in an informal discussion of peace,
though the expressions from the Allied
leaders, when ranged alongside tl
the German Chancellor's recent Reich- 1;
stag speech, do not appear altogether jh
conciliatory.
No decision lias boon reached here as o
to whether any official reply to these s<
statments will lie made public by the ti
German Government, though it is i>os- s<
slide this will lie done. One official
with whom I talked today declared
that making pence at this stage of the ei
war would be no nuvre difficult than a
adjusting the recent German-American 'XJ
submarine dispute. lie liointed out, f<
however, that 110 belligerent can pub- c?

Dutch Believe All Want Peace
I have just returned from a visit to
Holland, where I found that Dutch- m
men believe the English, French and fc
Herman i?eople all desire i?eaee. The ti
general impression in Holland is ibat 1)
the time for a decisive victory fur ol
either side has passed, although each T
f the belligerents may attempt a te
Summer offensive. k<
The Dutch think it is America's duty dt
to act now, and that the time is ripe
to bring the belligerents together.
One 'diplomat said that if the peace th
talk now in circulation continues for ri
a few mouths the belligerents will se

to bring them together in peace agree- ha
ment by October. Iti
, Asquith Said to lte Favorable.
The general impression prevails in
Holland that Premier Asquith and si;
Chancel lot* von .Itethmann-Hollweg P.
might make peace, but that the Kltcli- in
ener-Xorthcliffe group in England, ii
with President l'oincare in France, la
are anxious to continue the war. Hoi- st
landers declare that one reason Eng- w
land does not want peace now is be- ei
cause she believes that Herman sub- in
marines cannot lieliave, and that as w
'oilg as the possibility of tlie I'nited tl
>isites breaking oft' relations with tier- T
many exists Kugland would Ik* fool- 1:1
ish to make lnwe. el
The Dutch, however, regard tliis as
only an excuse set up by that group
in Kngland which wants a continuation
of tlie war.
Hollanders Want 1. S. to Lead.
The Hollanders are outspoken in
their regard for America. considering ^
the United States their la-st friend.
They desire that the United States (
lead the way for iieaee. feeling that
u
it is our duty to end the bloodshed.
To my surprise, souije Hollanders a
asked me when the Herman people Nv
are going to start a revolution, liecause
of the food situation. Although (
meat is scarce, although the shortage
may increase, the proposed new Hoverniuent
bureau to regulate the sale
of meat in Germany will provide liva- A
ble rations and prevent food demonstrations.
So far there is no indication
that any demonstrations at all
equaling the Irish uprising are likely
to occur.

FORMER GOV. BLEASE
BEGINS HIS CAMPAIGN
Formmer Governor Declares He is in
Race to Serve State?Attacks
the Administration.
Lexington, May 21.?Cole L. Blease,
ex-governor and candidate for governor
in the coming campaign, addressed
a large gathering at Rikard's
new Hour mill, eight miles from' the
county seat, yesterday. The former
governor was applauded frequently.
Mr. Blease declared that he was
j not running for governor now because
he wanted the job, but he was
running because he was representing
the great band of reformers which
was organized in 1800, and because,
at a conference of the followers of
this movement held in Columbia, at
which there were 2(52 representative
South Carolinans present, he was
called upon again to lend the light for
the i>eople. He said that he had endeavored
then as he had endeavored
Itefore, to get another to take up the
cause; but to this they would not

he felt that he eouhl lie of
service to lite people not to himself.
Mr. Blense declared that, no living
man knew the reasons which moved
him to resign as goverhor four days
liefore his term expired, hut one of
them was to give the Raptists of
South Carolina an opportunity to have
It said that one of their host and
greatest men, the late C. A. Smith of
Timtuonsville. had ;hcen governor.
Law and Order. ^
Mr. B lease charged that more white
women had been assaulted by negroes
since he left the governor's
office thau in ten years before; 14
more white men have been killed by
negroes in South Carolina since he
guve up the governorship than before,
ami yet, he said, people talk about
law enforcement and accuse the
Blease administration of lawlessness.
All this crime is not being perpetrated
by "Bleaseite, convicts" either; for,
he said only two of the enormous
number of 1,575 that received pardons
or paroles from him had since gone
wrong, according to the best information
obtainable. The speaker
teu in South Carolina are committed
\>y his political opponents, not his
admirers. He said that a day or two
ago he was asked by a man if he
would turn out the convicts as he
did before if he were again elected
he replied that he would not because
they were not in the penitentiary and
ou the chaingangs to turn oui?ne
had cleanel things out during his
four years in the governor's office,
he said.
Six convicts had received pardons
or paroles from the present governor
on Friday, he said, and, according to
the reports they were pardoned at
the suggestion of the pardon board,
to whom strong petitions had been
made; but during his administration
he bad no need of a pardon board and
he went down to the penitentiary and
opened the gates. The law then; as
now, provided for a pardon board and
he gave these positions to his friends,
but acted purely on bis own initiative,
he declared} saying further that he
was governor, "and even my bitterest
enemies won't deny that fact."
Mr. illease said that the present
governor is not the governor of the
people, but the "acting governor controled
by corporate interests and born
with a silver spoon in their mouths."
l'leu for Education.
Th? sneaker made a stronir anneal
for education, asserting that the hope
of the country depends upon the education
of the boys and girls, lie
scored the legislature for what he
termed extravagance in its appropriations
to Clemsou, Wiutbrop, and
other higher institutions, and for alleged
inequality in the distibutiou of
public funds to the rural schools. So
body 011 earth knows and nobody will
ever know, he said, how much money
Clemson college gets. He said that
the average country boy anl girl
could never reach the point where
they can enter these colleges and that
the free scholarships are handed out
to the rich?to those who are amply
able to pay for their chillreu's schooling.
Mr. Blease said that when he turned
Dr. Dabcock out of the asylum his
opponents declared that uo other mail
could till his place; that the insane
had been treated unfairly and the
asylum itself ruined, but as soon as
tho other forces came into power,
they put iu a man who used to be secretary
to the state board of health at
a salary of $1,800 a year at the head
of the asylunij with a salary of $6,000,
more than the salary of the governor,
Ho said that the present superintendent
of the asylum lives in a house in
the city of Columbia and practices
medicine every day "and they told you
that Dr. Dabcock was the only qualified
man for the place." The speaker
said that there was uo stronger

Tlie legifllature was scored for
creating new offlceB, among them the
State board of charities and corrections.
"If an? man can show me
where this office has done a dollar's
worth of good I'll vote for that man
for governor," he said.. He charged
that the secretary of the board receives
more than the governor of the
State, adding {he amount for expenses.
The former governor charged that
there are two men in the State holding
commissions under the present
governor as constables who have
never made a raid in their lives. One
of theese, he iWd, works in a cotton
mill and resifvet $3 a day for being
constable?all to build up a political
campaign.
He declared that he would not attack
any man's personal character
during the campaign, but he would
take care of himself in the event his
own was attacked.

He hooted at the idea of saying
that factionalism was dead, charging
hat the present administration carried
everything Its own way by the
tise of the "ste^m roller," showing the
Strongest sort Of bias and prejudice.

that the convention had turned down

FRESHEN! WILSON
IN CHARLOnE
OCCASION BIG SUCCESS.
A Crowd Estimated At Between 75,OOO
and 100,000 Atten 20th May
And Hear Nation's Chief.
Charlotte, N. C., May 21.?The greatest
event in many years in North Carolina
was the visit of President Wilson
to Charlotte yesterday to attend the
celebratiou of the 141st anniversary
of the ^signing of the Mecklenburg
Declaration of Independence, which
preceded by nearly one yeur what is
Known as the Declaration of American
Independence. Mr. Wilson was ac-i
compaued by Mrs. Wilson, Dr. Grayson
his physician, Secretary Tumulty,
Secretary of the Navy Josephus Dan
lels, Congressman E. Y. Webb, and
Senator Overman.
The President was in a happy
frame of mind and while his face
shows the anguish of care and anxiety
under which he has labored for
months, his smile is pleasing. He took
ft deep interest In all things about
him and the parade was especially
pleasing to him. He appeared much
interested in the floats of the Corn
Club boys, the Tomato Club girls,
and other farm products. These
drew from his solemn countenance
many smiles of approval from the
President of the United States.
Mr. Wilson's speech, which lasted
less than an half hor, was as follows.
President Wilson Speaks.
Jlr. Wilson said:
"Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen:
"It is with unaffected pleasure that

necessary when we get together in
! celebrations like this to take counsel
together with regard to Just what it
is that we wish to celebrate. You
will say we wish to celebrate the mem.
ories of that time to which we look
back with such p'.ide, when our fathers
with singular wisdom of counsel
and stoutness of heart undertook to
set up an independent nation on this
side of the water; but it is very much

ourselves of the elements with which
our forefathers dealt. There were only
three million citizens in that original
republic of the United States of Amer*
ica. So there are one hundred millions.
It is u long cry bacc to those
modest beginnings; a great period of
time not only, but a great period of
profound change, seize rates us from
that time, and yet I would remind you
that the same elements which were
present then that are present now.
"What interests my thoughts more
than anything else about the United
States is thut it bus always been in
process of being made ever since that
little beginning and that there have
always been the same elements in the
process. At the outset there was at
the heart of the men who led the
movement for independence a very
high and handsome passion for humau
liberty and free institutions. And yet
there luy before them a great continent
which it was necessary to subdue
to the uses of civiluzatiou if they
were going to build upon it a great
state among the furnily of nations. 1

very interesting circumstance that our
Lord's prayer begins with the petition
of 'our daily bread,' from which he
drew the inference that it is very difficult
to worship God on empty stomach
und thut the materlui foundations
of our life ure the first foundations.
What I want to call your attention to is
that this country ever since that time
has devoted practically all of its attention
to the material foundations of
its life; to subduing this continent to
the uses of the nation, and to the building
up of a great body of wealth and
material power. 1 find some men who
when they think of America do not
think of anything else but that. But,
my friends, there have been other nations
Just as rich und just as powerful
in comparison with the other nations
of the world as the United States
Is, und it is a great deal more impor
taut that we should determine what
we are going to do with our power
than that we should possess it.
Origin of America.
"You must remember, therefore,
the elements with which we are dealing.
Sometimes those of us who were
I torn iu this part of the country persuade
ourselves that this is the characteristic
part of America. Here more
than anywhere else has been preserved
a great part of the original stock
which settled this country, particularly
that portion of the stock which
came from the British Isles (I gun
not meaning to exclude Ireland.) And |
then I liud a great many of my friends |
who live in New England imagining
that the history of this country is
merely the history of the expansion
of New England, and that Plymouth
Itock lies ut the foundation of our institutions.
As a* matter of fact, my
fellow-citizens, however mortifying it
may he to them or us, America did
not come out of the South, and it did 2
not come out of New England. The
characteristic part of America originated
in the Middle States of New
York and Pennsylvania and New Jer- ,
sey, because there from the tirst was }
that mixture of populations, that mix- (
ture of racial stocks that mixture of ,
antecedents which is the most singu- j
lar and distinguishing mark of the ,
United States. The most important j
single fact about this great nation t
which we represent is that it is made t
up out of all the nations of the world, j
I dare say that the men who came to .
America then and the men who have ,
come to America since came with a t
single purpose; sharing some part of (
the passion for human liberty which ,
characterized the men who founded
the Republic, but they came with all ,
sorts of blood in ther veins, all sorts
of antecedants behind them, all sorts j
of traditions in their family and na- ,
tional life aud America has had to
serve as a melting pot for all the diversified
and contracted elements. What
kind of fire of pure passion are you going
to use in order that the mixture
that comes out may be purged of its
dross and may be the fine gold of un.
tainted Americanism? That is the
problem. (
Elements In the War.
"1 want to call your attention to
another picture. America has always
been making and to be made, and
while we were in the midst of this
process, apparently at the acme and
crisis of this process, while this travail
of soul and fermentation of elements
was at its height, came this
great cateclysm of European war, and
almost every other nation in the
world became involved in a tremendous
struggle which was what, my fele
^ elethe
very thing that has been going
on in America? It is a competition of
national standards, of national traditions,
and of national politics?political
systems. Europe has grappled in
war as we have grappled in peace to
see what is going to be done with
these things when they come into hot
contact with one another. For do
you not remember that while these
processes were going on in America
some very interesting things were happening?
It was a very big world into
which this nation came when it was
.born, but it is u very little world now.
it used to take us many days to go
from Washington to Charlotte in those
days as it now takes hours. I heard
an Irishman say if the power of steam
continued to increase in the next 50
years as it had in the last, we would
get to Charlotte two hours before we
left Washington. And as those processes
ot inter-communication have
been developed and quickened, men of
the same nation, not only have grown
closer neighbors; but uieu of different
nations have grown closer neighbors
with euch other; and now that we
have those invisible tongues that speak
by the wireless through the trackless
air to the ends of the world, every
man can make every other man in the
world his neighbor and speak to him
upon the moment. While those processes
of fermentation and travail
were going on, men were learning
ubout each other, nations were becoming
more and more acquainted with
each other, nations were more and
more becoming inter-related and intercommunication
was being quickened
in every possible way^ so that now
the melting pot is bigger than America.
It is as big as the world. Ain
what you see taking place on the other
side of the water is tremendous?
I had about said liual process by
which a contest of elements muy in
Clod's process be turned into u co-ordination
und co-operation of elements.
Processes of War Stand Still.
"For it is an interesting circumstance
that the processes of the war
stand still. These hot things that ure
in contact with each other do not
make very much progress against
each other. When you cannot overcome,
jou must take counsel. See
then, ladies und gentlemen, whut a
new age we have come Into. I should
think that it would quicken the imagination
of every u tin und quicken the
patriotism of every u an who cared |
fur America. Here ia America we

it into peace and the sulvation of
society V Does it not interest you
that America has run before the rest
of the world in making trial of this
great human experiment, and is it not
the sign and dawn of a new age that
the one thing upon which the world is
now about to fall back is the moral
judgment of mankind. (Applause).
There is no liner sentence in the history
of great nations than that sentence
which occurs in t% Declaration
of Independence (.1 urn now referring
tu tlie miner declaration ef Philadelphia,
net to the Mecklenburg Declarations
in which Mr. Jefferson said, 'A
decent respect for the opinion of mankind
makes it necessary'?and 1 am
not now quoting the words exactly?
'that we should state the grounds upon
which we have taken the important
step now asserting our independence.'
A decent respect for the opinion pi
mankind'?it is as if Jefferson knew
that this was the way in which mankind
itself was to struggle to realize
its aspirations and that, standing in
the presence of mankind, this little
group of three million people, should
say, "Friends and fellow-citizens of
the great moral world, our reason for
doing this thing we now intend to
state to you in candid and complete
terms, so that you will never think
mat we were merely throwing off a
yoke out of iinputlenee, but know that
we were throwing off this tiling in order
tliat a great world of liberty should
be open to man through our instrumentality.'

"1 would like, therefore, to think
that the spirit of thia occasion could
be expressed if we imagined ourselves
lifting some sacred emblem of counsel
and of peace, of accomodation
,und righteous judgment, before the nations
of the world und reminding them
of that passage in Scripture.. 'After
the wind, after the earthquake, after
the fire, the still small voice of humanity,"
