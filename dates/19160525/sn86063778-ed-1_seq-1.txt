IN PREPAREDNESS PARADE
President Says Europe is Undergoing
Stress Through Which America Has
Passed and is Warring Over Problems
Which America Has Peacefully
Solved.?Many Notable Guests
In Charlotte.
Charlotte. ? President Wilson addressed
approximately 100,000 people
hero attending the 141st anniversary
of the Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence. The President lighted
a beacon of hope to the war-ravaged
nations of Europe und pointed them
to tho peaceful conquest achieved by
the United States of America over the
identical problems that have plunged
Europe into the greatest strife the
world has ever known.
f Address Was Brief.
Though profoundly significant, the
address was characteristic in its brevity.
For exactly 18 minutes Mr. Wilson
spoke, and during that time tense
silence save for his spoken weds prevailed
throughout the cosmopolitan
audicnco which massed about his
stand.
Tho President talked Intimately,
seemingly not raising his voice above
a conversational pitch, to the throng
which crowded closely about his
stand and which rose tier on tier on
the largo grandstand across the street
President Views Parade.
Tho President's address was enthusistlcally
applauded by a crowd gathered
from several states to celebrate
tho ono hundred and forty-first anniversary
of the signing of tho Mecklon
burg Declaration of Independence
Bet'oro speaking he reviewed a long
military and industrial "preparedness"
parade, and afterwards he was the
guest of honor at a large lunch and
went ny uuiumuuue iu uaviusoa v. oilego,
20 miles away, where he once
was a student. He was accompanied
by Mrs. Wilson. Secretary Daniels,
Secretary Tumulty, Dr. Cary T. Grayson,
his naval aide, Senator Overman
and Representative Webb. Tho re
ceptlon committee included Governors
Craig of North Carolina and Manning
of South Carolina, and Mayor Kirkpatrick
of Charlotte.
A Great Day.
It was a cordial crowd that had
stood in lino for hours waiting to
heat tho voico and look upon the
face of the Nation's Chief Magistrate
and Mrs. Wilson. It was an eager
multitude that populated the line of
the parade for dozens of blocks and
cheered tho President with hearty
unanimity. And it was a happy crowd
that helped Charlotte celebrate May
Twentieth, 191f>. in a fashion that
sonds the day down Into the annals
of the city as one of tho most notable
In the history of the state.
With Precision.
With marvelous precision the pro
gram of the day was observed. Not
an Incident marred tho general en
Joyment. A parade which In variety
and quality has rarely been equaled
here was reviewed by the presidential
party, and President Wilson?the
master attraction of the ontlro event
?was seen by countless thousands,
and heard by many.
Veterans Give Souvenir.
The first Incident of Interest at the
stand was the appearance of Mecklenburg
Camp United Confederate
Vetorans, who came marching up.

the stand. A huzza from tho grandstand
announced their coming, a
glance revealed the cause and in a
moment tho President and Mrs. Wll
son were on their feet, the former
with uncovered head and an expanalvo
smile. The audience nrose?
that portion which was seated?amid
cheers which grew in volume as Commander
W. B. Taylor stopped In
front of tho stand and handed *o President
Wilson a huge hornets' nest.
The President smiled broadly as he
accepted tho tendered token. During
this time the Marine Band played
"The Star Spangled Banner," "The
Waf^h on the Rhino" and "Dixie,"
amid great cheering.
*:loar and strong rang the martial
note of tho parade. There were the

the veterans?Carolinians and Virginians?who
were like ambassadors
bearing messages of the past. After
the veterans had been cheerod came
a delegation of 100 students from
Davidson College. Then followed a
great procession of industrial floats.

When the parade had ended Mr

At the -conclusion of the eloquent

President Woodrow Wilson was briel

The effect was instantaneous. In i

the greatness of the moment, burst

Charlotte let Mr. Wilson know tlia'

that the same elements which wen

"What interests my thoughts mon
than anything else about the Unltec

States Is that it has always been in
process of being made ever since that
little beginning and that there have
always been the same elements in the
process. At the outset there was at
the lioart of the men who led the
movement for independence a very
high and handsome passion for human
liberty and free institutions. And yet
there lay before them a great continent
which it was necessary to subdue
to the uses of civilization if they
wore going to build upon it a great
state among the family of nations. I

very interesting circumstance that our

the Inference that it is very diffi- ;
cult to worship God on an empty stomr

. What I want to call your attention to is
I that this rountrv fiver .ilncn that tlm?
has devoted practically all of its at- |
tentlon to the material foundations of t
Its life; to subduing this continent to :
the uses of the nation and to tho building
up of a great body of wealth and j
material power. I find some men who j
when they think of America do not
think of anything else but that. But, '
my friends, there have been other nations
just as rich and Just as powerful
in comparison with the other nations
of the world as the United States
is, and it is a great deal more important
that we should determine what
we are going to do with our power
than that we should possess it.
Origin of America.
"You must remember, therefore,
the elements with which we are dealing.
Sometimes those of us who were

ourselves that this is the charart

that portion of the stock which

the passion for human liberty which
characterized the men who founded
the Republic, but they came with all

serve as a melting pot for all the diversified

anothor picture. America has always
been making and to be made, and
while we were in the midst of this
process, apparently at the acme and
crisis of this process, while this travail
of soul and fermentation of elements
was at its height, came this
great cateelysm of European war, and
almost every other nation in the
world becamo involved in a tremendous
struggle which was what, my felfellow-ieltizens?
What are the elements
in the struggle? Don't you see
that in this European war is involved
the very thing that has been going
on in America? It is a competition of
national standards, of national tradi
nulla, mm ui II ,1111 nun puiiurs?ponucal
systems. Europe has grappled in
war as we have grappled In peace to
see what is going to be done with
these things when they come into hot
contact with one another. For do
you not remember that while these
processes were going on in America
some very interesting things were happening?
It was a very big world into
which this nation came when it was
born, but it is a very little world now.
It used to take as many days to go
from Washington to Charlotte in those
days as it now takes hours. I heard
an Irishman say if the power of steam
continued to increase in the next 50
years as it had in the last, we would
get to Charlotte two hours before we
left Washington. And as those processes
of inter-communlcatlon have
been developed and quickened, men of
the same nation, not only have grown
closer neighbors; hut men of different
nations have i;rown closer neighbors
with each other; and now that we
have thoso invisible tongues that speak
by the wireless through the trackless
air to the ends of the world, every
man can make every other man In the
world his neighbor and speak to him
upon the moment. While thoso processes
of fermentation and travail
were going on, men were learning
about each other, nations were becoming
more and more acquainted with
each other, nations were more and
more be oming Inter related and intercommunication
was being quickened
in ever* possible way. so that now
tho meltlhg pot is bigger than America.
It As as big as tho world. And

Processes of War Stand Still.
"For it is an Interesting clrcuni
stance that the processses of the war
stand still. These hot things that are
in contact with each other do not
make very much progress against
each other. When you cannot overcome,
you must take counsel. See
then, ladies and gentlemen, what a
new age we have come into. I should
think that it would quicken the imagination
of every man and quicken the
patriotisim of every man who cared
for America. Here in America we
have tried to set the example of bringing
all the world together upon terms
of liberty and co-operation and peace,
and in that great experience that wo
have been going through America
