HOUSE TAKES FINAL
SLAP AT PRINCIPLE
OF HALF-AND-HALF
Proposal to Strike Out Rider,
Which Repeals Organic Law,
Is Defeated.
JINKHAM ASSAILS RIDER
Not Enough Advocates of Old
Rsoal Plan to' Get a Tellers'
Vote.
The House took a final slap at the
half-and-half principle today when It
overwhelmingly rejected the proposal
to atrlke from the District appropria
tion bill the rider which virtually re
peals the half-and-half plan.
Congressman Tlnkham of Massachu
setts, made the motion to strike this
rider from the bill but after a debate
of one hour the motion was rejected
on a vivo voce vote.
There were not on the floor even a
sufficient number of advocates of the
half-and-half principle to obtain a
vote by tellers. When Mr. Tlnkham
demanded tellers only seventeen mem
bers, not a sufficient number, second
ed his motion, and tho vlve voce op
position stood.
The language that Mr. Tlnkham
ought to strike from the bill was
that providing that hereafter all ap
propriations modo for the support of
the District 'shall be paid out of
revenues of the District, pf Columbia
to the extent that the same shall be
sufficient therefor, and the remain
der out of any money, in tle Treasury
not otherwise appropriated."
Under this arrangement the Federal
Government . will contribute only
about fS.OPO.'OOO to the District up
keep. Parliamentary Wrangle.
After refusing to eliminate this
legislative rider, the House became
Involved in a parliamentary wrangle
because Congressman Mondell raised
a point of order against a separate
paragraph applying specifically to the
proportion of appropriations for the
next year.- Mr. Mondell claimed that,
althoUKh the House had lust rone on
record In 'favor of, a system of ap
propriations noi on ine nau-ana-naic
measure, the half-and-half piari was
still a- law.and-lt waarsr change In
law to attempt to appropriate other
wise fdr the next year.
Congressman Page combated this
technical point. Tho debate won still
in progress early this afternoon.
Congressman ; of Ohio Insisted
that the House should' be Ilboral in
its appropriation for the District gov
ernment, and deprecated the fact that
ifcany cities have bettor parks than
the National Capital.
Campbell Opposes Repeal.
Congressman Campbell of Kansas
said the Federal Government had
made a contract with the District In
1878, that It had started on a hla,h
plane of development and that it
was now obout to repudiate Its con
trad and force the residents here to
keep up the extraordinary pace net
under that contract.
The half-and-half plan waa charac
terised as antiquated and unnecessary
by Congressman Card of Ohio and Con
gressman Page of North Carolina.
Congressman Longworth of Ohio de
clared that "the method pursued for tho
building up of the Capital for forty
years has gone In the right direction:
why change It now? American do not
question this pittance keeping Washing
ton where it belongs, as one of the
most dignified capitals of the world."
Congressmen Mondell and Oakey
advocated the half-and-half plan, and
Congressman Caraway spoke against
Early Peace Is Not
Expected By Germany
BERLIN, May 25.-German officials
cherish no high hones of an early ter
mination of the war. despite the in
creasing amount of peace talk In Berlin,
Washington, and London.
President Wilson's peace remarks at
the Mecklenburg celebration last Sat
urday impressed the German public
sympathetically, and won much notice
in the German presp. Officials, how
ever, are not optimistic. Though they
believe England la tired of the war, they
hold that France may exert such pres
sure on British statesmen as to prevent
peace until the expected allied offen
sive. The German newspapers, particularly
the conservative organs, do not relish
the Idea expressed by the Socialist lead
er, Philip Schiedemann. in an Interview
that President Wilson might be an ac
cpetable oeacemaker.

Baltimore and Ohio, Pennsylvania, and

Over 'Mystery.
Who Is tho "Washington and Chi
cago woman, prominent in social and
political circles," who has Just pur
chased "Tho Star of Klmberley Dia
mond?" This is the question which has been
going the rounds In social and politi
cal circles In the National Capital
since rumors of tho sale became cur
rent here. There has been much
speculation nnd guessing, and James
C. Lynn, of the Jewelry firm of Whlt
more. Lynn & Aldon. 1225 1J street,
who made the sale, has been Impor
tuned by many society women to dis
close the name, but he has not yet
gratified their curiosity. Whether he
will disclose it at some future day is
still a question.
Mr. Lynn confirmed rumors of tho
sale, today, adding that the diamond,
which weighs fifty-five carats and
sixty-one hundredths, Is now In Wash
ington to be remounted for the pur
chaser. One of Biggest Gems.
"The Star of Klmberley Diamond,"
Mr. Lynn said, "Is one of the largest
precious stones in the world, and one
of the most beautiful. It Is a canary
diamond, so-called becauso of Its rich,
brilliant yellow hue.
Included In its history Is the romance
of the diamond hunters' rush to South
Africa in tho early iffs, their awe and
wonderment over their rich discovery,
tho financial stringency In Paris fol
lowing the European war and the
bankruptcy of a Parisian Jeweler which
made the, sale of the mammoth gem
necessary.
Slnco the fall of 1914 the diamond has
been on exhibition In New York.
A few days ago "the Washington and
Chicago woman, prominent in social
ond political circles." made several
purchases of Mr. Lynn, and also In
quired If he knew where one of the
world-famous diamond could bo
bought. Mr. Lynn went to New York,
located tho Klmberley diamond, and
communicated with the would-bo pur
chaser. Sure of Sincerity.
So convinced were Mr. Lvnn and tho
New York Importer of tho society wom
an's sincerity In Inquiring about a. big
diamond that thev sent the Klmberley
em to Chicago for her Inspection. A
few hours after recelvlnr It she tele
graphed Mr. Lynn she would btiv It at
a fleuro In tho neighborhood of tfO.WM.
When the diamond was shipped to
Chicago It was wrapped In a pieco of
black velvet In n gloss rnse. The so

The specific charge on which the

In making this announcement Sec
retary Baker reversed his decision of
yesterday when he announced the
guardsmen would be given another
chance.
Inasmuch ns the guardsmen had not
taken the oath to obey the President,
the Judge advocate general was in
clined to 1-elleve and recommended, bo
permitted to take the double oath to
obey the President and the governor,
provided by .the new lw. if they failed

the Aur Department could net strip

In some quarters the refusal of th)

Utter exhaustion of the human

The breathing spell came with
Fort Douaumont in German hands

The bloodiest week in the world's

their death' in, the underground
caverns of Fort Douaumont with
out' the battle lines there being

The Paris official statement says
the Germans have lost more men
in the Verdun struggle during tho

of the fort, further gains that im
