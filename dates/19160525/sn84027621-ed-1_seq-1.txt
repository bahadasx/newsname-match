Douaumont, northeast of Verdun, the

CITY'S NEW AUXILIARY PUMP
ING PLANT SOON TO BE
PLACED IN SERVICE
The city's new pumping plant will
be placed in service next week, it is
learned. This plant, housed in a
small brick building to itself, com
prises two air compressors and two
centrifugal pumps, electrically-driven.
Only the air compressors, used to lift
Water from the deep wells, will be put
in service for the present,1 as the
pumps are not needed at this time.
The pumps have a capacity of a mill
ion gallons. The full auxiliary plant
put in operation has a capacity of a
million and a half, gallons a day, and
can be used to give the city a water
supply without the use of the old
plant or the proposed plant. Current
will' be obtained from the present
electric plant until the new station is
completed.

GOOD GAME
But a Small Crowd Saw Ocala Lose
to Fruitland Park
Before a very small and disappoint
ing crowd the Ocala boys lost to
Fruitland Park yesterday afternoon
by a scoreW 2-1, in the first contest
cf the season. The fact that the game
was yesterday , and not today, when
more of the business men could get
out, probably accounts partly for the
small crowd, but not altogether. The
game was a highly interesting one.
Had our boys received more practice
as a team the tale would have been
different. It, was a pitcher's battle
between Martin of Fruitland Park,
and Harris of Ocala, each allowing
but four hits. ? .
Before the game opened Mr. W.
Austin Bennett, one of the umpires,
made some very complimentary ' re
marks about the park, and especially
referred to the faithful work of Mr.
C. W. Hunter, manager of the Ocala
team. Mr. Bennett umpired at the
plate, and Mr. Judd Lloyd at the
bases.
Martin of Fruitland Park made the
first hit of the game, and the season
smashing out a two-bagger. Liddell
singled in the same inning. Medlin
and Alsobrook singled in the fourth
and Bartley in the fifth. J. Chazal
singled in the sixth, as did Alsobrook
in the seventh,' and J. Chazal again in
the eighth. Harris passed two on
balls, and .Martin two. Harris struck
out nine and Martin 10.
The line-ups were as follows:
Fruitland Park: Porter, c; Thomp
son, If;" Merlin, 3b; Saxon, rf; Also
brook, c ; Mears, 2b; Carpenter, lb;
Martin, p; Bowyer, ss.

Gin DOES HOT HAVE TO DEPEND
OHE MACHINE FOR IMMEDIATE USE IH CASE OF FIRE
The city has received from Twomb-
ly & Henney, enginers for the new
light and water plant, work upon
which has been started, a letter an
swering the question of insurance
rates raised by Councilman Tompkins,
and saying that, in case of fire, the
city is not dependent upon the start
ing of any one piece of apparatus for
electrical supply or for . starting the
large pumping engine.
"We are confident that the under
writers when they take into consid
eration the whole situation, will give
you as low a rate as you could hope
to secure with any plant that can be
designed," say the engineers. '
The letter in full is as follows:
We are informed that your city
council las raised a question concern
ing fire protection and insurance rates
in connection with the use of the De
La Vergne oil engine. There appears
to be a misunderstanding about the
fire protection provided for Ocala in
the new plant, and we feel . that we
ought to make plain to the council of
what thi3 protection consists. .
TANK ALWAYS READY
"In the first place, you have a tank
containing 150,000 gallons of water
which is .at all times available. In the
second place, you have a steam-driven
pump of large capacity which i3 driv
en directly by steam from the boilers,
and is not in any way dependent upon
the steam engine s or the oil engine,
or the electrical equipment. The air
compressor for, furnishing air for
driving the water from the wells is
also steam driven and independent of
any other piece of , apparatus in the
plant. In the third place, you have
the electrically-driven pumping ap
paratus in the auxiliary plant which
take the electric current directly from
the switchboard, and are therefore
not dependent upon any one piece of
generating v apparatus, as ' they can
be driven either by the 400-hp. steam
engine, the 150 K. W. unit, or the oil
engine, whichever happens to be in
operation at the time these pumps
would be put into service. Your
electric plant runs 24 hours a day
and therefore current is always vail-
able at the switchboard to : operate
the electrically-driven pumping ap
paratus; steam would always be avail
able to operate the steam-driven
pumping apparatus, and the large
tank will always be filled with water.
"It is evident therefore that neither
the steam-driven generating units or
the oil-driven units are directly con
nected to any of the pumping ap
paratus, and in case of fire, you are
not depending upon the starting of
any one piece of apparatus for. elec
trical supply or for starting the large
pumping engine.
"Underwriters in fixing a rate for
fire protection on property in your
city take into consideration the entire
means of , protection at the city's dis
posal, and not any one piece of ap
paratus. Where the only means of
fire protection depend upon an engine
directly connected to a pump, rates
for insurance are based on these con
ditions. ENGINE IS ECONOMICAL
"There are some makes of oil en
gines which can be started and ac
quire full speed in a minute to a
minute and a half; the De La Vergne
engine of the type proposed for your
plant requires three minutes. - As
stated before, it is evident that this
ngine is not designed to be connect
ed directly to a pump, but is design-
. to furnish electric current at the
switchboard at a low cost. We wish
to emphasize the fact that for your

explanation will convince you that the
interests of the city in the way of fire

the plant we have designed, and we

"In our specifications for an oil en

mentioning the De La Vergne oil en

them in successful operation in the

of oil engine, and because of their
reliability in continuous operation,

To Be Great Show; Fine Rehearsal
Held Last Night
A large crowd was present at the
first rehearsal of the big musical
show, "A Day on Coney Island," and
great enthusiasm was displayed by
both cast and , chorus. A strenuous
tryout was given, and every indica
tion is that the outcome will be very
successful. The show is full of mirth
and catchy music, with never a 'dull
moment. Carolyn Elinor Staley is
busy meeting committees from the
Woman's Club every day, and re

amateurs into a fairly graceful cho

(Associated Press) ,
New York, May' 25. The first to
save Dr. Arthur 'Warren Waite from

prosecution closed its case yesterday.
This morning the defense's counsel
marshalled alienists and relatives of
the accused man to prove him insane

John E. Peck of Grand Rapids,
Mich., by giving him repeated doses
of arsenic. It is understood the de
fense will not claim that Waite is in

show that his condition was highly
nervous several months preceding the
death of Peck and that he was subject
to "obsessions and a victim of mental
suggestions coming from another
self," which the defendant called the
"man from Egypt."
