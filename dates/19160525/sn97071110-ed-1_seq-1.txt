CALLED ASSET
LOST LAKE'S BEAUTIES EXTOLLED
Citizens Will Endeavor to Hasten Con
struction of Highway to Moun
tain Body of Water
In a photographer's window in Hood
River, Portland or some other north
western city you may have aeen a pic
ture of Mount Hood from the north
west corner of Lost Lake. It may be
that you have one of these unsurpass
able views banging on the walls of
your own home. You may have looked
at the photographs and passed remarks
expressing your admiration. So much
for the mere inanimate picture.
But have you ever been to Lost
Lake? No. Well, you ought to visit
that acenic mountain body of water,
glimpse in its cyatal deptba the mir
rored anowcap of Oregon'a guardian
peak, old Mount Hood, and then join
that little band of boosters for an auto
mobile road to the virgin forests
around the lake. The man who has
sat on Lost Lake's shores and pondered
over the beauties be can see there will
never forget it. You may Boon lose
from your mind an impression made by
a sight of the photograph of this com
munity, but never can you erase the
impressoins printed deep from an ac
tual contact with the handiwork of old
Mother Nature herself.
The above ia the gist of some of the
expreasiona made at a conference held
last week between local men and T. H.
Sherrard, state forest supervisor, and
W. T. Andrews, a logging engineer of
the United States forestry department,
relative to the ehoice of a route to
Lost Lake. The government men re
alize the asset Lost Lake will be to
Hood River county, once it ia access
ible, and the forestry service ia ready
to assist in building a road to the point.
The two above named men were here
last week for the purpose of stimulat
ing interest among Hood River people
in the Lost Lake region.
The government is contemplating the
sale of 350,000,000 feet of timber in
the Lost Lake region on the West Fork
of Hood river. Under existing laws 35
per cent of the returns from this sale
will be available for road building in
Hood River county. Thus excellent
highways should penetrate the forests
on the shores of Lost Lake.
The Oregon Lumber Co. holds pat
ented land, timber land, around Lost
Lake. A bill, introduced by Congress
man McArthur, ia now before congress
providing for the transfer of this tim
ber land for timber in some other part
of the forest reserve. The lumber
company is fostering the bill. Chas.
T. Early, manager of the company, is
willing to go further and evidence his
good faith, and is willing to execute
surety bonda that will prevent the de
struction of the timber around the
lake.
MAYOR ISSUES MEM
ORIAL PROCLAMATION
It is indeed a great personal pleas
ure, as well as the pleasant perform
ance of my civic duty, to remind the
citizensof our city and surrounding
vicinity of the return of Memorial Day.
On Tuesday next, May 30, recurs the
great day designated by precedent and
statute for the contemplation by all
Americans of the wonderful privilege
of American citizenship, the certainty
of a safely reunited country, peaceful
and aaie from dissension within and
from invasion from without our bor
ders, and for the reconsecrstion of our
selves to the wonderful work or human
ity yet at our hands to perform.
Let our people indeed sacredly ob
serve the day. Those whose great hour
60 years ago gave rise to this occasion
have all but passed beyond. To the
few veterans of 1861-5 remaining let us
do our greatest honor that of attend
ing: to the exercises of the day, and by
our presence and attitude and partici
pation pay honest and sincere homage
to those who gave so much that we
might today so exult tn our national
happiness, and in so doing make our
own hearts glad.
By virtue of my duty as Mayor or
this City I do urge upon all: Let this
great legal holiday be as well a moral
one, business and pleasures be for the
day put aside, and all come together in
the transaction of this our sscred duty
to the nation'a dead and surviving de
fenders. H. L. Dumble, Mayor.
MAYOR ALBEE IS
HOOD RIVER BOOSTER
Mayor H. R. Albee, of Portland, who
slipped quietly away from his official
dutiea for a vacation last week, has
been located at the raach home of Mra.
F. C. House on the West Side. Major
and Mra. Albee motored up from Port
land over the Columbia river highway
Although they have been here sine Isst
Friday, it was not learned until yes
terday by the general public that they
were in the valley.
Mayor Albee ia decidedly a Hood
River booster. "I have never seen con
ditions looking better nor the orchards
in finer condition," he aays. "Hood
River is on the up grade, and the Co
lumbia river highway is proving to be
a huge asset for you. I don't think
you can realise just what it meana to
you. I hope that the legislature at its
next session sees fit to pass laws that
will provide for the state taking over
the road."
Portland's chief executive ia inter
ested in several tracts of Hood River
orchard land.

made to finance tbe grower in such a
way that he will not lose title to bis

According to the government experts
who have devised the plan, it will be
necessary for the most successful oper

FORMER LOCAL MEN
FIGHT FOR BONDS
Chas. Hall and James E. Montgom
ery, now respectively president and
manager and commercial superintend
ent of the Coos & Curry Telephone Co.
at Marshfleld, are given unstinted
praise for their work during the past
several weeka for tbe bond issue for
good roads in Coos county. Tbe issue
was carried by a heavy majority.
Tbe Coos Bay Times, telling of the
election, says:
It is a great satisfaction to tboie
who were in the heated race for good
roads bonds to see the Issue carry by
such a good majority, as it leavea a
better feeling than if the election had
been close. There is only one story
to the result the country generally
went against it but the cities pulled
the plum from the coals.
President Charles Hall, ef the Coos
County Good Roada Association, has
worked night and day on tbe campaign
and to him ia the credit due for the
fine organization of foreea. Hia aide.
J. E. Montgomery, attended all but
two or three or the meetings held in
the county and the Golden SWeat quar
tet helped wonderfully. The work of
the campaignera showed up surprising
ly in some precincts where the good
rosds bonds two years ago got scarcely
s vote. Changea were made of from
10 to 85 votes where before tbe plaeea
were almost solidly agaitat bonding.
However, all give Frank Terrace
credit for winning tbe campaign for
good' roads and hia work was lauded to
the skies when the good roada advo
cates sat in the Millicoma club receiv
ing the favorable returns.
OFFICERS GET WIRE
AND JUNK THIEVES
William Lucas, Pete Hayes and Frank
Le Master, aliaa Frank Freeman, tbe
latter nursing a bullet wound in the
fleshy part of his arm, have been cap
tured by local officers and Portland
detectives and are in jail here awaiting
trial, Lucas lor the theft or aeveral
hundred pounds of copper wire from
the Pacific Telephone Co.. and the
other two men for an attempt to dis
mantle, that they might get ita brass
trimmings, an old pewer plant on Hood
river belonging to the Hood River Gaa
& Electric Co.
The operations of Lucas, are the
boldest ever carried on in Hood River
county. Tbe telephone company re
cently laid a cable in the vicinity of
Lindsey Creek, the old lines being left
strung on tbe poles. Lucas stripped
tbe Doles, one of which without the
support of the wire fell'on the cable
and attracted the attention or linemen
to.tbe theft. Tbe wire, valued at ap
proximately $200, was recovered from
a local secondhand dealer, H. Gross,
aeainst whom charges of receiving
stolen goods will probsbly be preferred.
Hayes and LeMaster, aeen Dy city
Marshal Carson in tbe junglee along
the Columbia, were suspected as bad
actors. They were wstched and trailed
to tbe old nower Dlant Friday night.
When they attempted to make a get
away Sheriff Johnson and Deputy Hart

the butlleta, probably deflected, atruck
LeMaster in the arm.
Bridge Needs Painting
Citv Engineer Price and L. A. Hen
derson, city treaaurer, who is a civil
engineer.have recommended to the city
council tbat the ateel bridge across
Hood River ia badly in need of new
naint. II is stated that the old paint
ia peeling from the steel work, and
that rust will soon aet in if new paint

The city owna tbe bridge, although it
is used chiefly by country traffic, and
the proposed improvement will prooa
bly be considered at the next meeting
of tbe city council.

F. M. GILL GETS SMALL PLURALITY
KeDy and Anderson, Republican Nominees
to RepresenUtiveship Johnson
and Bannura Win
No election in Hood River countv haa
ever attracted lesa attention than tbe
primariee of laat Friday. But little
more than 50 per eent of tbe registered
voters visited the polls. In Hood Riv
er county aa in other parta of the
state, Charles E. Hughes was the
choice of Republicans for presidential
candidate. Woodrow Wilaon received
practically a unammoua Democratic
vote, and Thomaa R. Marshall waa
nominated for President Wilson's run
ning mate. William Grant Webster
received the Republican nomination for
vice presidency.
The race for atate senator snd state
representative attracted more attention
possibly than any other in the county,
and supporters of J. R. Nickelsen, who i
waa opposed in this countv bv Joaenh
W. Morton, and F. M. Gill in Wasco,
aapirant for atate senatorsbip, were
surprised at the result.
final unofficial returns from the two
counties of Hood River snd Wasco,
comprising both tbe senatorial and rep
resentative districts, showed Mr. Gill
te be the nominee with a purality of 26
votes. Anderaon and Kelly were shown
to be nominees for representative, the
latter having but 83 votes more tban
J. T. Adkisson, tbe third Republican
from Wasco in tbe race.
Citizens of Waaco county bave been
conceding that Hood River county
should have repreaentation in the legia-
aiture. and tbe result of last Friday's
primary will probably concentrate tbe
aupport of both Republicana and Demo
eratea on Geo. R. Wilbur, the unop
posed Democratic candidate lor sena
