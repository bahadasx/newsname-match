Recent reports from Special Agent
Rodgers. at Mexico City, have indicated
a growing friendliness toward the

had convinced officials of the dc facto
government that the t'nlted States had
no ulterior motive In operations on

Rumors that General Carranza might
in some form renew his request for
withdrawal of the expedition were
given credence, however, by some of
ficials t'nofilclal advices have re
flected a grave. domestic situation In
Mexico. due to labor and other
economic difficulties, and to the menace
of renewed revolutionary activities. It

fvia motor truck to Columbus, N. M.,
May 24).?A marked difference be
tween Villa strongholds and other
towns in Southern Chihuahua was re
ported to-day by officers who have
made the campaigns close on the
bandit's trail.
In the solid Villa districts there were
evidences of prosperity. The people,
there declared that Villa protected
t them, taking what he needed from them
Jfwlth considerable sense of discrimina
tion. The towns of mixed politics,
peopled by both Villa and Carranza
j>artisnns. were, all on the verge of
misery. The Villa adherents in such
places reported that the bandit chief
was in the habit of protecting them,
hut of plundering the, Cnrranza sympa
thizers.
They complained that Carranza com
mands plundered both Villa and Car
ranza communities without discrimina
tion; always taking care, however, to
announce that they were seizing prop
erty "in the name of the government."
Carranza sympathizers themselves com
plained that petty officers exercised
altogether too wide a latitude in secur
, ing supplies on the promises of the
government to repny.
At the small town of Cienegas, near
Satevo, an Associated Press corre
spondent saw one of these forays by
a small Carranza command. The town
was well stripped. Afterward an old
Mexican complained to some American
troops who were passing, asking them
for protection and exclaiming:
"Villa' takes what I have to eat. Rut
these people have taken all I have to
eat and my donkey besides, and even
took my riata [Mexican hair rope
lasso}. They left me no tools."
Outside of this territory of at best

Sir Edward Grey Plainly Reiter
ates That Position of Allies
Is in No Way Changed.
AGREE TO ACT TOGETHER
Discusses Propriety of Employ
ing "American Press as
a Platform."
LONDON, May 24?Sir Kdward Grey,
thf British Foreign Secretary. in a
speech in the House of Commons to-1
{day. set aside all ideas that peace
negotiations were probable at the pr<*s
' ent stage, and plainly reiterated that
the position of the entente alius was
j in no way changed.
Sir Edward's Impromptu address was
on the. question of peace and the pro
priety r.f employing the "American
press as a platform." subjects raised by
Arthur ronton by. Liberal member for
Stirling. Scotland, In a strong address
attacking the. government for allowing
: diplomatic etiquette to stand in the
I way of possible pea.ee pourparlers.
Sir Edward declared that it was im
possible to consider terms of peace
without a previous agreement between
the allies. Further, he expressed the
.decided opinion that the hostilities had
not yet reached a stage where it was
possible to talk of peace, especially as
the Gorman public was continually
being "fed with lies" by their minis
ters.
Mr. Ponsonby's reference to the use
of the American press as a platform
was the outgrowth of a recent inter
view with Sir Edward Grey. Sir Ed
ward, in replying to this attack, while
admitting that important disclosures of
policy ought first to be made to Par
liament, argued that a crisis might
arise during the war when considera
tions of etiquette should not he allowed
to stand in the way. He contended
that, since German statesmen con
stantly were giving interviews and
statements to the American press, it
would be mere pedantry which would
hinder British statesmen from counter
ing these statesments in the interests
of their own country.
PON SON IIV AUtit'KS AGAINST
OH LIGATIONS TO ALLIES
Mr. Ponsonby argued in favor of
| countenaclng peace possibilities and
against prolonging the, war, merely for
the sake of obligations to Great Brit
ain's allies The speaker said that if
the war had to be continued until Con
stantinople fell, or until the unknown
obligations to allies were fulfilled, the
country ought to be told what those
obligations are. and if there was no
essential differences between Germany
and Great Britain and no such obliga
tions, the government ought to take
the earliest opportunity to press for
a termination of the war.
Sir Edward Grey, in replying, said
if he thought the German government
or German opinion had reached the
point where the allted governments
could bring a peace compatible with
their desires nearer by making speeches
about peace, he would make dozens of
them. But, the Foreign Minister added.
that time has not yet arrived, and the
allies were bound by common obliga
tions not to put forward any terms of
peace except by mutual agreement.
The Foreign Secretary characterized
Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg's recent
statement that Great Britain was pre
pared to go to war over Bosnia as a
j ??first-class lie " The real reason for
the prolongation of the war was that
the German government was con
tinually telling their people that they
were winning the war, and that the
I allies were beaten.
Sir Edward here made the declara
tion that the time for peace had r.ot
yet arrived, and that the entente allies
: were under obligations not to act sepa
rately on peace terms. He added if
' any of the allies had a right to speak
; with regard to peace at the present
moment, it was France, on whom the
furious attack of Germany has been
concentrated.
FHANf'K HAS FIHST RIGHT
TO SPKAK AIIOl'T l'KACIC
Sir Edward further said:
"Through the long battle of Verdun.
: France is saving, not only herself, but
lier allies as well. If any one has a
j right to speak about peace, it is
France, and President Poincare has
spoken. I believe it is the. duty of
diplomacy to maintain the solidarity
of the allies and to give the utmost
support to the national and military
measures which are being taken by
i the allies in common to bring the war
to a stage it has not yet reached, In
: which the prospect of maintaining an
enduring peace will be with the allies.
"Mr. Ponsonby has hardly seemed to
realize that we were at war.
"I care not how often I say it: this
war could have been avoided by accept
ing a conference. Why was the con-(
ference not accepted? Because there
I was no good will."
j Sir Edward then added:
"I only wish the German and Aus
| trlan governments had published the
! reports of their ambassadors as to the
I part Great Britain played at the Balkan
\ conference."

SEVERS TO MAKE !
JACKSON STATUE!
" !
Sculptor Who Created Gettys
burg Monument Awarded
New Commission.
'MAY ORDER MINOR CHANGES;
L
Committee Will Confer With
Artist To-Day on Final
Form of Memorial.
i After having examined thirty-one
, i
models. and four times submitted \
! the design to competition, the Stone- |
wall Jackson Monument Association j
yesterday afternoon accepted the I
design for an equestrian statue to
the great Confederate chieftain, of- i
fered by F". William Slevers, a sculptor
who has achieved national renown by
designing the equestrian statue of j
General Robert E. to be erected on
the battle field of Gettysburg. Mr.
Sievers wns informed of the success of
his endeavor by The Times-Dispatch, j
the news being later confirmed by a j
member of the association.
For more than a year sculptors from
Texas to New York have been working
on designs for the greatest statue to
Stonewall Jackson in the South, but
always the committee discovered de
fects in characteristic of man and
horse. There probably will be changes j
in the model submitted by Mr. Sievers. j
for members of the committee, rather j
to Mr. Sievers's disappointment, stated j
that they would prefer to have the ;
horse show more spirit. Mr. Slevers ,
has both rider and horse in an atti- i
tude of repose, departing from the idea. !
prevailing largely in Europe and to a j
great extent in this country, that the ;
horf-e. should always show action.
Mr Sievers has drawn his model upon j
plain and simple lines. It shows Gen
eral Jackson astride his mount, hat in
left hand, in the act of reviewing his
j troops. He is in complete repose, and i
his horse is standing on all fours. It j
is a position, the sculptor says, whtch I
will not weary ihe eye, and which al- j
ways will give to the beholder a s.ense '
of relief.
HEIGHT OF MOM'MUXT
IS THIUTY-XINE FEET
Mr. Sievers stated that he had pre- ,
pared a horse of perfect proportions,
somewhat after the type of "Planet." a
famous racing horse of the days shortly
rafter the Confederacy. But the animal
in bronze will be higher stationed and
have a shorter neck, showing charac- i
teristics of the thoroughbred rather !
than a marked resemblance to the ?
I Arabian steed. While the great com- ?
: mander is shown at ease, there Is a
I certain alertness about the head of the !
j horse as if the smell of battle were 1
I in his nostrils and he were listening
i for the bugle's call.
The pedestal probably will be con- |
structed of Virginia granite, though
Mr. Sievers was rather inclined to
? Mount Airy stone because of the large
ness of its blocks and smoothness of
its grain. However, smaller pieces can '
be so placed together as not to show .
jointure. The height of the monument,
from bottom base to rider's head, will
be thirty-nine feet. The statue will
he sixteen feet from the horse's foot
to the iider's head. The bottom base
j will be twenty by thirty-two feet.
The pedestal is plain and severe. .
without decoration, except for the
bronze torches upon the fourth base,
symbolic of immortality. Mr. Sievers
expressed his willingness to make
whatever changes the committee de
sired. The changes probably will be
to make the pedestal of large design,
with perhaps a little more decoration. '
and to give the horse some display j
of action. Mr. Sievers prefers, how-!
ever, that the horse remain on ail fours,
departing from the French and Italian
idea, which generally shows the horse
in action or in the death scene.
WIM, TAKE TWO YEARS
TO COJII'I.ETE STATVK
Mr. Sievers said that he would ask ?
for twenty months or two years in
which to complete the statue. All the '
work, save the bronze casting, will be j
done in his studio at Forest Hill, and
so will be under constant supervision i
of the members of the committee.
When the committee on design met on
Wednesday afternoon a week ago. the
! competition had narrowed down to a
I contest between Mr. Sievers and E. C.
! Pc*ter, of Greenwich. Conn. It was
! because of the likeness of the Sievers
design to General Jackson and because
of the proportions of the horse that |
; he was given the award. The fact that
Mr. Slevers had designed the equestrian
statue to General Lee, which is to ?>e ,
: placed on the battle field of Gettysburg
also played a large part in the selec- ?
tion. This statue is now being cast
in bronze in the Tiffany studios at !
Corona, L. I. It is regarded by sculp
tors and critics as a great work of art.
Mr. Sievers will hold a conference!
with Judge George I,. Christian, chair-j
man of the committee, and Edwin l'?. |
t'ox tn-day to draw up a contract and
to settle details as to changes the'
! commission desires.
The statue will be erected at the
intersection of Monument Avenue and .
the Houlevard. It will be in line with
that historic row of silent figures
which the South has erected to the
greatest leaders of the Confederacy.
It will fill a vacancy thnt has been re
served for the man who was second
only to L?ee. A year ago, during the
Confederate Reunion in Richmond, the j
corner-stone for the monument was!
laid and consecrated, former Attorney-;
General William A. Anderson deliver- i
ing the address of dedication. Toward
the monument fund the city of Rich
mond contributed $10,000; the State
gave Jlo.ftOO, and the remainder of the
money was contributed from every
other State in the South.
The monument will be a heritage, not
only to the people of Virginia, but as*
well to the people of every State from
which a soldier went to fight in the
Confederate causc. It will be a greater
t memorial, perhaps, than that statue

Senate the nomination of Louis D.
Brandels to he associate justice of the !
Supreme Court. Ii was a strict party j
vote, all the Democrats voting for con-1
formation and all the Republicans!
against it.
Supporters of tl/> nonitnee plan to!
ask for action on the nomination by I
the Senate to-morrow at an executive j
session, while th? opposing' Senators '
are planning to force, if possible, open !
sessions for the consideration of the
nomination. Prolonged debate may re- i
suit, but Mr. Brandeis's friends claim!
he will be confirmed before ihe recesses
for the national conventions, which j
begins on June 3.
After weeks spent in taking testi-1
mony through a subcommittee and In-1
discussing the subcommittee's report,]
action came without debate to-day in
a seven-minute session. There was
nothing said beyond calling the roll.!
Doubt as to the outcome existed until
the name, of Senator Shields was
reached. His vole in favor of Mr.
Brandels was the deciding factor.!
He arrived here from Knoxville I
this morning. Just in time for the
committee meeting. Before entering !
the committee room he. conferred with !
Senator Hoke Smith. Afterwards he j
still refused to indicate how he would
vote. Had he voted against a favosa- ;
able report, as had been predicted, the
committee would have reported the
nomination to the Senate without rec
ommendation.
The nomination was sent to the Sen
ate by President Wilson on January
L'S. Weeks were spent by a subcom
mittee taking testimony regarding
charges against Mr. Brandeis, formu
lated by a committee of citizens of
Boston. The subcommittee recom
mended confirmation by a strict party
vote of 3 to 2.
For weeks the Judiciary Committoe
has debated the testimony taken by
tin; subcommittee. Doubt existed for
a long time as to the vote of Sena
tors Reed, O'Oorman, Smith, of Geor
gia, and Shields. To win a favorable
vote, It was necessary for all to vote
for Mr. Brandels. It become known !
last week that Senators Reed. O'CJor- j
man and Smith would vote for con- I
firmation, but doubt continued about {
Senator Shields.
The nomination will now l?e taken to
the Senate, and Mr. Brandeis's friends
predict that confirmation will follow
shortly.
Senators voting for confirmation were
Culberson. Overman, Chilton, O'Oor
man, Fletcher. Reed, Ashurst, Shields,
Walsh and Smith, of Oeorgia. Those
against confirmation were Clark, of
Wyoming; Nelson, Dillingham, Suth
erland, Rrandegee, Borah, Cummins
and Works.
The charge against Mr. Brandels was
unethical conduct.
Friends of the nominee plan to
opposo open sessions on the ground
that this is a movement for delay in
confirmation, and if open sessions are
to be had they should be provided for
tt)l nominations.

asserted manifested itself in the form
of a 'little man from Kgypt. pave the

Wattes lawyers will proceed in their

time he killed John E. Peck, and
thereby save him from the electric

something of the. sympathy she felt for
him. ? ..
Although called as a witness for the
State Mrs Horton seemed to be much
relieved when Walter R. Deul. counsel
for Waite. began to cross-examine her.
Walte. who had sat almost motionless
throughout the long, direct examina

George N. Brothers, dropped his hand
from his chin and raised his eyes to

"insisted" on paying, and finally of the
