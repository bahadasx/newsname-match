HOUSE NAVAL
BODY CLAIMS
BILL IS WEAK
Committee in Minority Re
port Denounces $241,
000,000 Appropriation.
CALLED INADEQUATE
Amount Regarded as Insuffi
cient Liberal Allow
ances Are Urged.
Washington, May 25. Republican
members of the house naval affairs
committee in a minority report sub
mitted to the house today, denounced
the $241,000,000 naval appropriation
bill, reported by the majority as
wholly inadequate and urged more lib
eral allowances to make the United
States navy second greatest in the
world.
The minority charged that the ma
jority ignored opinions of. naval ex
perts and recommendations of Secre
tary Daniels and was based on a com
promise between interests which
wanted no additional navy protection
and those which wanted only a slight
increase.
The republicans recommended that
the bill provide for two dreadnoughts
omitted by the reported measure, six
battle cruisers instead of five, 50 coast
defense submarines instead of 20,
$.1.;00.000 for air craft instead of
$2,000,000, still greater increase in per
sonnel, creation of a national defense
council and means for rushing the
building program by using more than
one shift of workmen daily.
The bill should provide, the report
declared, for the full number of men
required on a peace basis and should
authorize the presidem to order at his
discretion enlistment of such addi
tional men as the navy might need, not
to exceed the SS.T62 recommended by
the general board.
"We have 72 submarines built and
building." said the minority report.
"The lowest estimate of our require
ments by any naval authority is 150."
The general board advised expendi
ture of $7,000,000 on the aeronautical
service, the report pointed out- Com
menting on the proposal for a defense
council, it said:
"Experience in modem wars has led
all other great nations to establish
such a council to insure unity, contin
uity and cooperation in all branches
of national defense."

Wilson Talk
Stirs Berlin
Peace Hopes
Berlin, May 24, via London. May 25,
7:15 a. m. (Delayed.) A wireless
dispatch from the United States giv
ing the substance of President Wil
son's speech at Charlotte, N. C, in
which he referred to the possibility
of American mediation in the war, is
given the place of honor in the morn
ing papers. The afternoon editions
return to the subject and their com
ments, together with the wide interest
shown by the German public, show
how important this news is regarded
here.
Though definitely stated nowhere,
there is little doubt that Germany is
willing to consider a tender of good
offices to inaugurate peace negotia
tions. If President Wilson can hold
out tangible possibilities that peace
may result through his mediation,
Germany will undoubtedly be willing
to consider such suggestions as may
offer.
This receptive attitude is naturally
subject to the condition that Germany
is not jockeyed into a position of an
nouncing her readiness to accept
President Wilson's good offices only
to find the allies later rejecting the
tender and asserting that Germany is
suing for peace. There is equally lit
tle doubt that the great masses of
people willingly would see America in
the role of peace intermediary.
Wilson's declaration cannot be said,
however, to have made a good impres
sion in Germany as far as the so
called "armor plate" newspapers like
the Tages Zeitung and the Taglische
Rundschau are concerned. Other
Chauvinist organs take occasion to
remember President Wilson with hit
ter and uncomplimentary phrases and
even a moderate paper like the Lokal
Anzeiger declares that the president
should demonstrate first the impar
tiality of his neutrality by making
good his demand for respect for
American rights against England. He
would then have an excellent chance,
says this paper, of succeeding in his
peace measure, so far as Germany is
concerned.
Washington, May 25. President
Wilson told callers today that, the in
tervention of a neutral in behalf of
peace in Europe could rest only on a
mutual understanding by the bellig
erents that term's to be arranged are
to conserve the interests of all, and of
the world at large, rather than those
of a particular nation or group of na
tions among the warring powers.
His callers gained an impression
that the president would entertain
suggestions that he extend his good
offices to the belligerents to bring
about peace only when the conditions
he outlined were likely of fulfillment.
Those who discussed peace with Mr.
Wilson construed his remarks as prob
ably forecasting what he will say lat
er in the week, addressing the League
to Enforce Peace.
While the president is eager to see
the conflict end as soon as possible,
the White house visitors were able to
gather no impression that a move by
the United States to bring it about is
in immediate prospects at least.

SLAUGHTER TERRIFIC
Losses of Men Suffered by
Both Sides in Great Bat
tle Is Appalling.
Berlin, May 25, ("by wireless to Say
ville.) The repulse of three counter
attacks by the French on the village of
Cnmieres, to the west of the Meuse on
the Verdun front, was announced by
the war office today. The capture of
additional French trenches southwest
and south of Fort Douaumont and the
recapture of the Haudremont quarry
by the Germans are also reported.
The test of headquarters statement
follows:
"Western front: German airmen
attacked British torpedo boats and pa
trol boats off Flanders coast.
"West of the Meuse three enemy
counter attacks against Cnmieres
failed.
"To the east of the Mcnse our regi
ments captured enemy trenches south
west and south of Fort Douaumont
We recaptured the quarry south of the
Haudremont farm.
"In the Caillette wood the enemy at
tacked our positions without attain
ing the least success. The enemy suf
fered heavy losses. We captured more
than S50 prisoners and 14 machine
guns.
"An enemy biplane was shot down
near St Souplet and another over
Herbebois.
"Eastern, front: The situation is un
changed. "Balkan front: Enemy airmen un
successfully attacked Uesleb and Giev
geli." Paris, May 25 (11:30 a. m.) Ger
man troops made an attack last night
: on French positions on the Verdun
front east of the Meuse near the Hau
dremont quarry and obtained a foot
ing in one of the French trenches, the
war office announced today.
East of Cumieres to the west of the
Meuse the French made some progress
in hand grenade fighting.
There was no infantry action at
Fort Douaumont last night Activity
on the part of the artillery was par
ticularly severe in the vicinity of Hill
304 and in the sector from Dead Man's
Hill to Cumieres.
French War Report,
The text of the statement follows:
"On the left bank of the Meuse there
has been an artillery duel of consid
erable intensity in the sector of Hill
304, as well on the front between
Dead Man's Hill and Cumieres. Last
night we made progress with hand
grenades immediately east of Cumi
eres. "On the right bank of the river a
strong German attack was successful
in giving the enemy a footing In one
of our trenches at Haudremont In
the region of Douaumont there has
been no infantry activity. The night
passed in relative quiet on the re
mainder of the front."
Capture 300 Metre in Front.
Inspection made by military author
ities of maps of the Verdun region
shows that within the last month Ger
man gains on the west bank of the
Meuse from Cumieres to Avocourt av
erage a depth of 300 metres. The line
eastward from the river is substan
tially the same as it was a month ago.
French Admit Loss
The tide of battle at Verdun flowed
against the French during the last 24
hours. The Germans, rallying from
the smashing blows which took from
them the greater part of Fort Douau
mont, hurled their legions once more
against the ruins which retain by
courtesy the title of fort, and, by a
lavish expenditure of life, succeeded
in partially retrieving the ground they
had lost They also gained a small ad
vantage on the left side of the river.
Military opinion here is not greatly
concerned over the result of the
day's fighting. Such incidents are re
garded as inevitable in the strategy
of action and reaction upon which the
stubborn defense of Verdun is based.
The aim of the defenders is to inflict
the greatest possible loss upon the
enemy at the least possible cost to
themselves. French counter attacks
are expected to restore the situation
by tomorrow in favor of the republic
The village of Cumieres gives the Ger
mans a slight advantage, as it com
mands the French lateral communica
tions. The village is so well covered
by the French artillery that the Ger
mans will be unable to profit to any
great extent by its possession.
DEFENDER OF LIEGE
REFUSES A RELIEF
Havre, May 25 The German author
ities have offered to allow General
Iceman, the defender of Liege, to go to
Switzerland, according to news re
ceived here. Because the permission
was granted on the ground of his ill
health and age, the general rejected
the offer saying that, he did not wish to
admit that he was unfit to fight for his
country.
lVS '
NEW PROTEST
SENT FRANCE
AND ENGLAND
Vigorous Language Is Used
in Notes Forwarded on
Mail Seizures.
Washington, May 25 Vigorous lan
guage, equalling almost that employed
in the last communication to Germany
on the submarine issue, is understood
to characterize the notes delivered to
the British and French embassies here
yesterday protesting against interfer
ence with neutral mails.
Outlines of these communications
have been cabled to London and Paris
by the embassies and the full text will
be forwarded by mail. This is taken
to mean that replies will be framed
only upon mature consideration.
It is understood there is no sub
stantial difference as to principle be
tween the state department and the
Paris chancellors regarding the
broad question of inviolability of first
class mails on the high seas. The
American objection is based rather on
the methods employed by the allied
governments in handling these mails.
The United States does not concede
the right to inspect first class mails
in transit on the high seas, assuming
that these do not include anything
more than correspondence and are
not made the vehicle of supply of con
traband to the belligerents. The fact
that a neutral nation s mail is com
pelled to go into a belligerent port to
comply with belligerent naval rules
does not give the belligerent the right
to take away neutral privileges from
high seas.
Ambassadors Page in London and
Sharp in Paris, have been informed by
cable of the delivery of the notes and
acquainted briefly with their nature.
A resolution authorizing the trans
portation of mail to and from neutral
ports on naval vessels and declaring
that 'any interference with our mails
shall be resented by such ships with
all power of the navy and of the
ships," was introduced today by Rep
resentative Tague of Massachusetts.
The resolution was referred to com
mittee. ELECTiONCLOSES

GREAT SPORT
Return True
Bills Against
Rebel Chief
London, May 25, (12:40 p. m.) The
grand jury today returned true bills
against Sir Roger Casement, leader of
the Sinn Fein revolt and Daniel J.
Bailey, the former British soldier, who
is held as his accomplice.
The action of the grand jury follows
the preliminary hearing before police
magistrate at which Casement and
Bailey withheld their defense and were
held without bail pending the grand
jury deliberations.
The judge fixed the trial of Sir Roger
for June 26. t
In explaining the law to the jury
the judge stated it was necessary that
treason should be proved by overt acts.
In the indictment against Casement as
it stood, he said, six overt acts were
mentioned.
The court nominated Alexander Sul
livan of Dublin and Artemos Jones,
who appeared for the defense at the
preliminary hearing as counsel for
Casement. It is understood that Pro
fessor J. H. Morgan, who took part in
the defense at the preliminary hearing
will appear.
Holman Gregory and W. T. Snell
were named to defend Bailey. Thom
as Scanlon, member of parliament and
one of the secretaries of the Irish
party, also will appear for him.
Dublin, May 25. Astonishingly little
interest is displayed here in the trial
of Sir Roger Casement
Casement was almost entirely un
known here before the war. Since
then vague reports of his activities in
Germany have been all that have
reached the Irish public.
As an element in Irish politics Case
ment had no existence. The impor
tance attached to his connection with
the Sinn Fein revolt both in England
and abroad is not quite understood in
this country.

GERMANS TO
REJECT PLAN
TO AID POLES
British-American Arrange
ment for Poland Meetsr
With Disapproval.
The Hague, May 25 (via London,
3:15 p. m.) It is declared here on
information from authoritative Ger
man sources that there is not the
slightest chance that Germany will
accept the British stipulations regard
ing the plan to feed the civilian pop
ulation of Poland through an Ameri
can commission. It is therefore not
considered likely that any relief for
the Polish people will be accomplish
ed this year.
This information is unofficial, as the
German cabinet has not passed on
the British proposals submitted by
James W. Gerard, the American am
bassador, but high German officials
consider a refusal a foregone con
clusion. The British counter proposals to the
plan for feeding the civilian popula
tion of Poland were received by Am
bassador Gerard in Berlin on Tuesday
and advises stated that he expected
immediately to start negotiations with
Germany on the subject The British
stipulations were that the projected
relief must be applied to that portion
of Poland in Austrian occupation as
well as that part occupied by Ger
many and that Germany and Austria
must also agree properly to care for
the populations of Serbia, Albania and
Montenegro.

Court Martial of 116
Members for Action. J
REVERSES DECISION
Intended to Await Signing
of New Militia Act
Sees Mistake.
Washfntrton, May S& rvenEleui
Wilson will personally appoint the
members of a court martial which
will try 116 members of the Texas
national guard for refusal to pre
sent themselves to be mustered In
to federal service.
Washington, May 25 Berersfmr
his previous decision, Secretary
Baker announced today that the
116 members of the Texas nation
al guard who failed to present
themselves for muster Into the fed
eral service will be brought to
court martial immediately under
the present law. Mr. Baker had In
tended to await the signing of the
new militia law now before the
president and proceed under Its
provisions.
Secretary Baker explained Ms ac
tion by pointing out the difference in
the enlistment oaths guardsmen are!

Under recommendation of Judge Ad

the guardsmen refusing to "present"'
themselves for muster, was committed
under the Dick law and trial should be
under that law.
General Crowder fn a supplementary.

Marathon, Texas, May 25. Lieuten
ant Colonel Natividad Alvarez, leader
of one of the bands that raided Boquil
las and Manuel Torres, another of the
raiders, were brought here early today
and given into custody of Deputy
Sheriff Shoemaker to be taken to Al
pine for trial before civil authorities.
The prisoners were heavily man
acled. Alvarez, a very ordinary looking
peon, refused to talk but admitted he
had played a part in the sacking of
Deemer's store.
His companion, Torres, a boyish
looking figure, when asked why he
had invaded American territory to rob
and kill, said: ,
"Six months ago I was living at Sac
remento, in the state of Durango,
working on a little farm belonging to
my parents. One day a number ot
armed men came and took away ev
erything we had stored to keep us un
til the next crop came. They even
took our clothes.
"Later on, another band appeared,
only to find that we had nothing left
The colonel looked at and said that I
might make a good soldier. I told him
I did not want to Join the army. He
looked at me again and finally said:
'You have no shoes; your feet are
sore; your trousers are torn; yon
have no coat; it is cold and yon say
that you are hungry. Come with me
and I will feed and clothe you.' I
Joined him and for a time we had
plenty to eat and something, to wear,
but times became hard again and our
chief decided to strike along the Rio
Grande on the Mexican side, where
he said food and forage were more in
abundance.
"We reached the river opposite Bo
quillas and camped. Some of the men
suggested that a raid be made across
the river and it was agreed upon.
'The raid was carried out. but I
did not participate in it I was one of
10 left on the Mexican side to guard
the retreat and there I remained un
