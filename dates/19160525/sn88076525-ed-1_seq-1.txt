Saturday morning company with

-Mb. Harry,, ye editor we secured the
vge 0f
joim Honey's Ford and jour-
j»eyed to Wood Lake, landing at Fair
'wiew Resort, which has recently been
established by Rotiert Watts. It is
seedless to say that we were bent cn
^Tflshing, and all the necessary tackle
yraa taken along, including a .very
Ml peculiar little instrument, which was
carefully guarded by Mr. Hazzard, and
^Imbwn as "dowgiac". Now, some peo.
Attorney Goer came along with his
ear and a nice new tent and as he was
goingto Warwick for the night he ten.
dered us the use of his tent and we
decided to remain and get the morn
ing fishing. Joe and Ole were very
anxioub to remain over night,
later we discovered the reason. It was
given out by Mr. Watts that there was
to be asocial dance there that evening,
and they were anxious to take it in.
Well we remained over and to say that
we had a good time is putting it mild.
After Mr. Watts and his good wife
had served us with all the good things
to eat and we had enjoyed the evening
•cigar, the crowd began to arrive bring
ing with them a fiddler. It reminded
of the stories we have read about
the various clans in Scotland, when
leader blew his horn they rapidly
gathered, coming over the hills and
dale from every direction—but they
came just the same. The word was
given, and the dance was on, and how
we waltzed ad two-stepped te the tune
•f "Casey Jones" and "It's along way
to Tipperary". And in speaking'of the
party, one could not go anywhere and
find a more social gathering of fine
young people than there was there
that evening. But the pleasant hours
had passed and it was time to retire
to our little tent, with only, two blan
kets to furnish the matress and cover
ing, and a couple of auto cushions for
pillows. Joe furnished the back log
and Ole the front log, and it left your
humble servant and Harry to sleep in
the middle, which was very pleasant
under the circumstances. Talk about
uisery but we believe that we suffered
more to the square inch that night
than ever before, and at four o'clock
some one came along and said that it
was four o'clock and time to go fishing
again, and with one accord all rose up,
not one grumbling about getting up so
early. After an hour's fishing and
nothing doing but one small pickers',
ns
Mrs. Watts again, having coffee, sand
wiches and doughnuts, after which we
returned home reaching here safe and
sound, with an even dozen of the fin
ny tribe to our credit, but rather a
tired lot of fishermen.
Wood Lake is bound to become a
popular resort, as the fishing promises
to be good this season, and Mr. and
Mrs. Watts who have charge of Fair
view, are both pleasing and accommo
dating and spare -no pains in giving
their patrons

This was the pride of Mr. Hazzard and

METHODIST DEVINE EXPIRES I
BEFORE CROWD AT GENERAL|
CONFERENCE.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 16.—
Rev. John J. Manker, of Athens, Tex
as, editor of the Methodist Advocate
Journal, fell dead while addressing a
meeting of the book committee of the
Methodist general conference today.
Dr. Manker, who was 12 years of age, I
was the father-in-law of the late John
A. Patten of Chattanooga, Tenn.
A gathering of about 200 was listen-1
ing to'Dr. Marker's address when he
hesitated for a moment.
"Excuse me," he said, and then he I
sank to the floor. Death was almost
instantaneous.
The unification of American Meth
odism was advanced another step to
wards consummation today when by a
vote that was virtually unanimous the
880 delegates to the general confer
ence of the Methodist Episcopal church
adopted the report of thespecial com
mittee on unification, paving the way
to an amalgamation with the Metho-1
dist Episcopal church, south, and the
Methodist Protestant church.
Supreme Moment.
"This is the supreme moment of my I
life," cried Bishop Cranston. "A
marvelous result has been achieved",
Bishop Hendricks said. "I pray that
the whole Methodist body throughout 1
the world may more and more see eye
to eye and Bishop Cranston and my
self may live to stand jointly over the
united general conference of united
Methodism in Aiperica.

BIG FIELD FOR COMMERCIAL
CARS IN SMALLER CITIES.
The theory thata the market for
commercial cars is restricted pretty
much to large cities is disproved in
figures compiled by the Studebaker
Corporation and announced through
Henry T. Myers, sales manager of the
commercial car division.
'"Commercial car sales in towns of
5,000 to 50, 000 inhabitants are con
siderably greater in proportion to the
population than in the large cities,"
says Mr. Myers. "We can name in
stances even where the Studebaker
car sales during the past four months.
"There are several Studebaker com
mercial car dealers who in the past
three months have sold between ten
and twenty-five oommercial cars in
towns of not over 35,000 population.
One dealer who lives in a town of a
population of some 35,000 people has
sold as many cars to merchants, liv
erymen and farmers as the total sales
of each of three large branches."
Selling commercial cars is not a
matter of location or of population. It
is wholly a matter of getting out and
going after commercial ear business
along well defined- and systematic
lines. Of the lOjOOO balf-ton and one
ton models to be produced during 1916
by the Studebaker corporation, a large
proportion have been spoken for by
distributors in towns of a size that

FORMER PIONEER OF RAMSE
COUNTY PASSES AWAY 4^
HIS KNOX HOME.
Ramsey county people will be pauied
to learn of the death of Hans 1^. Ug
land, who passed away at his home at
Knox after a brief illness, the cause of
his death being brights disease. The
remains, accompanied by the family
were shipped to his old home at Ken
yon, Minn., where Mr. Ugeland was
born, for burial.
In the early eighties Mr. Ugland
came to Ramsey county and settled
on a homestead about two miles from
where the village of Crary now stands,
and he with his splendid wife and two
boys lived there until a few years ago,
when they entered business at Knox,
moving there. Since then he had re
tained the old homestead, renting it.
The were pioneers of this county and
were identified with its growth and
upbuilding.' Mr. Ugland sei"/ed for
several terms as county commi jsioner
of this county and for one term in the
state legislature as a member from
this county. He was a highly respect
ed citizen, and all who knew him re
garded him as a good citizen and an
able financier. For several years he
with his son David, conducted a large
implement business and also cwned
and operated a bank at Knox, besides
having large farming oerations. In
his death the state has lost a good
citizen and one who will be missed
both in social and business cilcles.
Besides a loving wife he leaves two
sons, Dayid, who was associated with
him in business at Knox and Louis,
who resides in Montana. He also
leaves a brother Ole, who resides near
Crary.
FORMER DEVILS LAKE MAN
RUNS OVER AND KILLS CHILD
WITH CAR.
The many friends of Thomas Mont
gomery, who lived in this city for some
time but now residing at Dickinson,
this state, will be sorry to learn of the
terrible accident which he had. While
driving his car in Dickinson, he ran
down and killed a three year
child. While it was purely an acci
dent, and a most sorrowful one, it is
liable to cause Mr. Montgomery much
trouble and possibly prosecution.

VOTING STRENGTH
BY ACTION OF NON-PAR-
xSAN LEAGUE.
Bismarck, N. D., May 24.—Political
entanglements in North Dakota. are-J^
growing more complicated each day.iff
In the Republican party an "insur- 'J
rection within an insurrection" is
under way. That the Farmers' Non-$|l
partisan Political League has split the|||
strength of the progressive republi
cans in twain is the opinion: of politi-%%
cians who have made a close study of
the situation. A remarkable feature
is that the stalwart republic:
as are
making no concerted effort to capture
the offices as a result, but are swing-"'"
ingtheir support tq such of the pro^
gzessive republicans as are candidates
against so-called "league candidates."
Governorship Chief In Interest....
The governorship is attracting re
markable attention with four candi
dates in the field, Lynn J. Frazie
league candidate J. H. Fraine, U. L.
Burdick and George Smith. This bat.
tie is holding first place in the interest
of the voters, even the United States
senatorship taking a secondary posi
tion. T,
Fraine is absolutely confident of the
outcome. His supporters take the po.
sition that he will receive added sup
port from those who see in him
a
chance to beat the league. Smith is
not execeted to poll a heavy vote, but
the vote he does receive may be a fac
tor in ndetermining the outcome as be.
twteen tins dther candidates.
Hanna's Prospects Said to Be Good.
.. Governor L. B. Hanna has no politi
I cal organization, but he has built up a
remarkable personal following and
many are inclined to concede his suc
cess over McCumber for the Senate.
The feature tha appeals strongly for
him is the fact that he has been in
strumental in reducing the state's in
debtedness during the three years of
his administration hore than three
quarters of a million dollars. While
maning this reduction, the taxation,
for state purposes, is lower, than at
any time since territorial days.
Nationally the goveronr takes a
strong position for preparedness of a
character that will guarantee protec
tion for the lives and property of the
people, and at the same time it. ike for
peare.
Senator P. J. McCumber has been
secured to deliver the Decoration Day
address in this city. All arrangements
are being made for a good program,
and a big crowd is being looked for.
The senator is one of the able speakers
of the state, and those present on that
day can rest assured that they will
hear a good talk.
IS
That Burdick and Frazier will di
vide the strength ordinarily polled by
the progressive republicans is gener
ally accepted. Frazier has the &up
ort of the league. Burdick, under or
dinary conditions, would have received
the united support of progressive re
publicans, as opposed to Fraine. 0'&
The Minneapolis Journal published
a story concerning the possibility of
Sam Clark becoming a candidate" for
governor. According to the political
yarn, Sam is to be brought out by
Tommy^Pool, who sees in this a chance
to beat Col. Fraine. Sam recently
hobnobbed with the Kaisers family
Germany, and in the Jim Jam Jems he
has appeared verye friendly to th
Germans. He might get a good share
of the German vote which otherwise
would go largely to Fraine. Clark
may not become a candidate, but the
Journal's story has set some of the
politicians to thinking^-—Ward County
Independent.
The Elks held a regular meeting
Saturday evening and quite a. number
of outside people who are members of
the order were present. Among those
were Dr. W. P. O'Brien and James
Galloway of Egelanid, Messrs True
blood, Kelly Cunningham and .Robin
son, of Brocket, W. A. Hausman and
W. F. Engelhorn of' Churchs Feirry, R.
