Fargo, May 22.—The democratic
Btate and congressional ticket was fill
ed at a meeting of the state executive
committee, held in Fargo on Saturday
evening and Sunday.
Hugh McDonald, of Valley City,
candidate for the nomination for con
gress in the second district, -was the
last member of the ticket to be select
ed, his candidacy being announced at
the conclusion of the committee ses
sion.
Previously efforts had been made to
bring Wesley McDowell, of Marion,
into the field as a candidate for the
nomination, but he refused to make
the race at this time. Mr. McDowell,
who gained considerable prominence
in the state several years ago, while
a member of the state senate, has
dropped out of active politics during
recent years, because of the pres3 of
private business interests.
Mr. McDonald, the chosen congres
sional candidate, is one of the best
known democrats of the state. He ia
a pioneer of the Valley City district,
and has served in several official
capacities—including membership on
the Valley City normal school board
for several years under appointment
by John Burke, former governor.
E. H. Stenvick, of Minot, while not
a member of the executive committee,
was in attendance, and it is generally
understood that the purpose of his
coming was to explain some features
of the recent attempt made by him to
have D. H. McArthur made land office
receiver at Minot. Members of the
executive committee are political
enemies of Mr. McArthur, and at no
time looked with kindly eyes on the
attempt to land McArthur Jn the
Minot job.
That McArthur's appointment is no
longer likely, is now the general con
sensus of opinion among democrats.
It is understood he is without the
support of the state committeeman—
H. H. Perry, of Ellendale.
Mr. Stenvick's candidacy for the
chairmanship of the state committee
was announced here, he proposing to
succeed Mr. Perry. The change will
be made in a few weeks.
The executive committee adopted
resolutions urging the democrats to
bring out full tickets of county candi
dates in all counties.
Damostnte Range at
VeMefrMjkro-AHabTs
P. I. Dahlen, of Milwaukee, Wis., is
in the city this week demonstrating the
Duplex Alcazar coal and gas range at
the Veblen-Myhro-Aldahl store. The
stove is two ranges in one, and both
fuels can be used at the same time.
The Duplex Alcazar provides comfort,
convenience and economy all the year
around, and it even does more than
.that, it saves time. It Is a single
range, only 43 inches long, and gas,
coal or wood can be used separately,
being the only range made used
for both without interchanging any
parts. The strongest point is the
oven. By simply pushing the lever
backward, the oven is ready for use
with coal or wood, with nothing to take
out, or nothing to interchange. When
used for gas, pull the lever forward at
the side of the range, light a match
and light the gas. The gas broiler is
also conveniently placed. Mr. Dahlen
Is demonstrating the oil and coal range
as well, two ranges In one which
means city comfort to the rural homes.
Call at the Veblen-Myhro-Aldahl Co.,
as the demonstation will continue until
Saturday evening.

Nome Man Installs an
Electric lighting Plant
Nome Tribune: James Nelson has
his electric light plant installed and
had the juice on last night, and i|
certainly looked good, and Jim wasn't
stingy with his lights either. He had
several installed on the front and it
lights up the side walk and the street
in front of the store, and alight across
the street at the garage that lights
the walk there, and one at the back
of the building at the alley, so he has
the street well lighted up around his
buildings. He has several lights in
the garage and his living rooms and
the store well lit up. It puts on quite
a metropolitan appearance and shows
that there is another business man
that has a progressive turn of mind.
The Times-Record takes pleasure to
day in presenting a cut from the archi
tect's drawing of the new building now
under construction for the Valley City
Grocery Co. The foundation and pil
lars are now complete and work on
the superstructure will begin within
a few days. The cut shows the fine ap
pearance the building will present
when completed.
The building is to be 55x150 feet,
two stories and basement, of solid ce-
ment construction, and will be abso
lutely fireproof. It will be finished
about Aug. 1, at a cost of approximate
ly $30,000. It will be equipped with
electric elevators and every modern
convenience for the economical hand
ling of stock. With trackage along
the south of the building two freight
cars can be handled at once.
The Valley City Grocery Co. was

Three Instructors Resign
at Agricultural College
State Board of Regents Will
Hold May Meeting in This City
Fargo, May 23.—Several important
changes are about to occur at the
North Dakota Agricultural college. It
Is rumored that the public speaking
department and the English depart
ment are about to be reorganized, with
some possible changes in the faculty,
and a number of other changes.
Professor B. A. Orr, head of the col
lege conservatory of music, has re
signed, and as this department may be
changed around or dropped entirely it
Is possible no successor will be chosen.
Miss Haggart, physical instructor, and
Miss Stoner, domestic science depart
ment teacher, have also resigned their
positions as a result of the shakeup.
Miss Jensen of Bozeman, Mont., is
expected to take the place of Miss

been filled yet. Miss Jensen is a for
mer Cass county girl, and a sister of

master for the occasion. The prin
cipal address of the evening was given

Wheatland on the east to 30 miles of
Bismarck and 20 miles of Minot on the
west. With this territory to supply
nearly everything is bought in car
load lots, saving the merchants of this
section the difference between carload
rates and the local rates on small ship
ments from eastern wholesale houses.
The growth of the business in the past
two years is evidence that the mer
chants of the territory appreciate this
advantage and we predict that with
the opening of the new house the busi
ness will see a rapid growth.
Valley City also appreciates the val
ue of her wholesale houses and of
firms like the Valley City Grocery Co.,
who spend their money for the better
ment of the city and hopes that the
business of the houses will grow in the
same ratio that the past has shown.
With the excellent railroad facilities
and the rapid growth, of population In
this territory there is every indication
of continued growth and extension for
these institutions.
