counties six weeks ago, when it was .
acquired by W. S. Gilman, of Sioux
City, Michael Mullally, of Dakota
City, Neb., has commenced action in
the district court at Dakota City to
set aside the judgment and fore
closure. The petition, which he has
filed with George Wilkins, clerk of
courts, also asks the court to quiet
title and cancel notes and mortgages
and to allow exemption. Six de
fendants are named in the suit,
which will bo tried before Judge
Guy T. Graves on questions of law,
jury not being needed. Thedefend
enta are E. E. Halstead, of Ponca,
Neb., Security bank, Ponca, Neb.,
James Walsh, of Waterbury, Neb.,
W. S. Gilman, of Sioux City, Ru
dolph Shopke, of Emerson, Neb.,
and W. I. Challan, of Waterbury,
Neb. The mortgage on the farm
was held by Mr. Halstead and the
Security bank of Ponca. At the
foreclosure sale the land was pur
chased by Mr. Gilman, who in turn
s'Bld it to Challan and Walsh. Mr.
Mullally's action is based on the al
leged lack of jurisdiction of the
enirt, because of the irregularities
in the foreclosure sale. More than
a half dozen attorneys will bo en
gaged in the litigation, which may
come up at the s'sion of tiie court
which opens at D.. ota City tomorrow.

Sioux City Journal, 22: On the
allegation that irregularities were
practiced in the forced sale of his
320-acro farm in Dakota and Dixon
Sioux City Journal, 19: Four ex
press wagons loaded with liquor
were seized yesterday afternoon by
Patrolman Ed Becker and Detectives
Fied Spencer and Harry Luce, as
the vehicles passed to the Iowa side
of the combination bridge en route
from Jackson. Neb., to Sioux City.
Three arrests were made and a large
quantity of liquor, alleged to have
been improperly addressed, was
taken from two of the wagons.
Harry Beath, 17 years old, and Law
rence Moran, 18 years old, of Jack1
son, Neb., and M. J. Williams, V5Q
years old, 206 Cook street, said to bq
drivers for the Overland Express
company, each were charged with
the illegal transportation of liquor.
Beath and Moran were in charge of
one wagon. The other two wagons
taken by the police were released at
headquarters after it was learned
that the packages carried were
properly addressed and billed. Ac
cording to the police, the released
wagons were those of the Interstate
Transportation company, whose
wagons and warehouse were raided
several weeds ago by a police squad
under Special Investigator Jens Neil
sen. The liquor seizure yesterday
amounted to twenty-three cases and
three barrels of beer and about thir
ty gallons of whisky. The wagons
were driven into the barn at police
headquarters, where officers check
ed off the packages in the wagon
with the bills of lading carried by
the drivers. To make a further test
that the packages were being deliv
ered in accordance with the law, the
street numbers on the labels were
checked with the city directory.
Liquor containers which bore alleged
improper or no labels at all were
held by the police, while the other
packages were allowed to remain on
the wagons. One of the stalls at
police headquarters, formerly accu
pied by patrol horses, was converted
into a liquor storeroom, where the
goods may be kept under lock. Beck
er, Spencer and Luce yesterday
afternoon spent several hours
on the combination bridge waiting
for the approach of the liqnor wag
ons. Notice
