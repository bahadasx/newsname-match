PRESIDENT EARLY INTERVIEWED
Head of Polytechnic School Makes A
Very Interesting Statement
Thomas A. Early, president of the
new State Polytechnic school, is in the
city on business relating to the school
and expresses himself as highly opti
mistic over the prospects of the insti
tution, to the preliminary organization
work of which he is now devoting his
best energies. That the school will
open next fall equipped In buildings,
appliances and faculty in a way to en
able it to perform its intended service
to the people of its community and
state is Mr. Early's confident predic
tion.
In discussing his plans Sunday Mr.
Early said:
"Our original plant will consist of a
main building, two dormitories one
for boys and one for girls and a shop
building. An attractive campus of
twenty acres is provided and we are
assured of adequate lands for demon
stration purposes and the raising of
products for the boarding department.
"The school will be a comprehensive
polytechnic school and the general
purpose of its courses of study will be
industrial efficiency. The curriculum
will comprise agricultural work gen
eral farming, development of the live
stock industry, fruit growing, poultry
work, farm co-operation, rural organ
ization work, dairying, and other in
dustrial work for boys and girls. The
manual training feature will be prom,
inently featured, with practical shop
work, and carpentry, general manual
arts and mechanical drawing will be
taught.
"No department will be more import
ant than that relating to the training
of girls. Courses will be provided for
girls In all phases of nome life, the
course to be much broader than mere
sewing and cooking. Among subjects
emphasized will be household decora
tion, caring for the sick, home sanita
tion, home gardening, poultry and the
care of milk and butter.
"There will be no slighting, however
of literary work. There will be a
heavy course in English and a requir
ed amount of history .mathematics and
sciences. The English course will be
thorough in all departments.
"It is desired to emphasize the fact
(hat the coet of training will be as low
as possible and, in fact, within the
reach of, every boy and girl with, an
ambition to get a thorough and prac
tical education. The tuition will be
free. " i ' '
"The enthusiastic Interest of the
people of Cookeville and of that sec
tion cannot be too highly commended.
Ktorr rltWon unit Institution nf tile
town lh squarely behind the enterprise
and as an Indication of the profound
and whole-hearted interest of the peo
pie of Cookeville in the school, the
homes of the town have been placed
at the disposal of the authorities to
help out in case the dormitory facili
ties are inadequate when the school
opens early in September. Every pos
sible means of advertising and public
ity are being employed by the busi
ness men of the town in the interest
of the school and it is predicted that
a full attendance of students will be
on hand at the opening session."
Mr. Early expressed gratification ov
er the warm and active support assur
ed the institution by the etate board
of education. It was cordially sympa
thetic, he said, in Its assurances to do
everything possible for the upbuilding
of the institution and to this was added
the inspiring assurances of like char
acter from school men all over tne
state.
One of the main objects of Mr. Ear
ly's energetic attention at present was
stated to be the actual organization or
a faculty and the arrangement of the
courses of study. That Mr. Early's
broad equipment and extended experi
ence in practical school organization
work is guarantee of the success of
the institution under his management
is the confident prediction of his
friends.
