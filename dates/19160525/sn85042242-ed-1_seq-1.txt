TRIES TO CONVEY
SYMPATHY TO WAITE
Claims Relations With Dr.
Waite Were "Purely
mmtrnrnrn^mm
Platonic."
New York, May 24.—Mrs. Margaret
Weaver Horton, the young woman
with whom Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
confessed poisoner of his wife's par­
ents, studied languages and music
and shared a "studio" in a fashion­
able New York hotel, described late
today at Waite's trial for murder what
she considered the dual character of
the prisoner. This alleged Jekyll
Hyde nature of Waite, the evil side
ol" which he has asserted, manifested
itself in t.ie form of a "little man from
JSgypt," gave the first inkling of the
theory upon which Waite's lawyers
will proceed in their efforts to prove
he was insane at the time he killed
John 15. Peck, and thereby save him
l'rotu the olectric chair.
.Mrs. Morton, who cast sorrowing
glances at Waite, as he sat, pale and
outwardly ill at ease not more than 20
feet from her, followed Mrs. Clara
Louise Peck Waite, wife of tiie pris­
oner, on the stand. It appeared to
those who watched Mrs. Norton close­
ly that she was trying to convey to
the prisoner something of the sympa­
thy she felt for him.

Relations "Purely Platonic."
On cross-examination, Mr. Deuel
asked Mrs. Morton: "Your relations
with the defendant were purely Pla­
tonic, were tbey not?"
"They were," answered the witness.
"What did tlte defendant tell you
lie did for a living?"
"Why, he said he was doing re­
search work for Dr. Muller."
Dr. Muller had testified thai

death. Waite told him, lie said, that
he yvanted the poison to "kill some

was interested in the study of bac­

•When.' iMrs. Morton was excused
from the stand, Mr. Deuel asked the
court to instruct the jury to disre­
gard all testimony about Waite's
study of bacteriology. The court so
instructed the jury. The state then
rested and Mr. Deuel made the formal
motion for the dismissal of the case,
which was denied.
FARMER IS
HI BY BE
Neighbors Take After 88-Year
Old Man After He Had Kill­
ed His Daughter.
Iowa, Kan., May 24—Geo. Becker,
88 years old, wass hot and fatally
wounded late today by a posse of
neighbors who pursued him from his
farm, where he had killed his daugh­
ter Lena, fatally wounded a neighbor
and burned his farm buildings. Be­
fore Becker was shot, he slightly
wounded one of the no««e.
An application for the appointment
of a guardian for Becker's property
holdings is believed to have caused
the trouble. When the aged man
learned of the action taken in court
by relatives, it is said he became en­
gaged at his daughter and killed her.
A neighbor named Miles, who at­
tempted to interfere, received injuries
which may result in his death.
Becker then fled across the prairie
after setting fire to everything which
would burn on his farm. As he was
about to be overtaken, Becker opened
fire on his pursuers, wounding one of
them before Becker was shot.

LIBRARY SITE
IS SELECTED
New Public Library Will Bo
Erected on Lots East of
the City Ilall.
"ARCHITECTS MAY NOW
SUBMIT THEIR PLAN1I
A meeting of the board of directors
of the Public Library was held last
evening, at which the site for Ihc
new library building was selected.
The lots east of the city, owned
by the city, were selected, after the
directors had investigated a number
of available sites. A number of suit­
able locations could have been secur­
ed, but the price in most cases was
prohibitive. The location next to the
city hall is an excellent one, and is
practically in the heart of the city.
Architects will now have an op­
portunity to submit plans for the
structure. The board will go over
the plans later and select the one
best suited to the needs of this city.
'No action was taken by the library
board at the meeting last evening
relative to engaging a librarian to
take charge of the library here at
once. The matter will likely be
brought up at the next meeting and
favorable action taken.

New York City's Executive
Tells of a Few Conversa­
tions Heard on Wires.
New York, May 24.—Two separate
investigations were continued today
into the wire tapping" operations of
the .New York police. One was by
the legislative committee, headed by
Senator George F. Thompson, and the
other by District Attorney I2dw*tl
Swann.
The committee permitted Mayor
Mitchell to take the witness stand and
read into its record conversations al­
leged to have been heard over tapped
wires during the investigation of
charitable institutions, after warning
him that it considered the conversa­
tion "irrelevant" and informing him
that he must assume all responsibil­
ity for any libel charges that might
result from them. The mayor was
attended by a squad of detectives, and
his appearance in the committee
room was the signal for considerable
disorder. Counsel for Rev. William
B. Farrell, one of the clergymen in­
volved by the mayor in his allegations
of a conspiracy, protested formally
against permission being given to
have the conversations read into the
record. Several spectators jibed at.
the mayor, and the committee chair­
man resorted to a threat to clear the
room in his effort to restore order.
The substance of the conversations
revealed by the mayor referred chief­
ly to ways and means for keeping
witnesses and evidence away from
the Charities investigation commit­
tee.

IN REGARD TO NOTE
Have Convinced Obregon and
Mexicans of Good Inten­
tion of U. S.
Washington, 'May 24.—'No authorita­
tive forecasts of the proposals to be
made by Gen. Carranza in his new
note had reached officials here to­
night, and while some apprehension
was apparent that its tenor might not
be entirely satisfactory, the general
feeling was one of confidence that
it would open the way to a definite
agreement for continuous co-opera­
tion ol' American and de facto forces
in the pursuit ot' bandits in northern
Mexico.
Recent reports from 'Special Agent
.Rodgers, at Mexico City, have indi­
cated a growing friendliness toward
the United States. Mr. Rodgers' dis­
patches have said that Gen. Obregon's
report on his conferences at the bor­
der with Gen. Scott had made a strong
impression on the officials of the de
facto government and had convinced
them that United States was acting
in good faith and had no ulterior mo­
tives in its operations on Mexican
soil.
May Renew Request.
Humors that. Gen. Carranza in some
form might renew his request, for
withdrawal of the expedition were
given credit, however, by some ofli
cials. Unofficial advices have reflect­
ed a grave domestic situation in Mex­
ico. II has been suggested I hat un­
der llie cireuuiiitances, the de facto
government, might fear the. conse­
quences at home of a recession Iroin

dicated that the note was on its way.

Bring Back Bodies
Columbus, N. M., May 24—A truck
train was prepared here tonight to
leave for the south, carrying men to
disinter the bodies of American sol­
diers killed in clashes with Mexican
bandits, and bring them back to Am­
erican soil.
While no accurate list of the Ameri­
can troopers buried in Mexico was
available here, military authorities be­
lieve the total would not exceed ten.
A lengthy message in code was
transmitted from Major General Fun
ston to General Pershing, expedition­
ary commander, today. While mili­
tary authorities here declined to dis­
cuss the dispatch, it was believed it
contained instructions to General wi­
shing as to the disposition of liis
troops in certain eventualities.

IN FAVOR OF PEACE
Thinks People Should Be Tak­
en Into Confidence of the
Government.
London, May 24—in an impromptu
speech in the House ot Commons to­
night on the question of peace and
the proprietry of employing the Am­
erican press as a 'platform," sub­
jects unexpectedly raised by Arthur
Ponsonby, Liberal member for Ster­
ling, Scotland, in a strong address,
attacking the government for allow­
ing diplomatic etiquette to stand in
the way of possible peace parleys.
Sir Edward Grey set aside all ideas
that peace negotiations were possible
at the present staKe and plainly re­
iterated that the position of the al­
lies was in no way changed. Sir Ed­
ward declared it was impossible to
consider terms of peace without an
agreement between .he Allies. Furth­
er, he expressed the decided opinion
that the hostilities had not reached
a stage as yet where it was possible
to talk of peace, inasmuch as the
German public was being led with
"lies" by their ministers.
American Press
Mr. I'onsonby's reference to the use
of the American press as a platform
was the outgrowth of a recent inter­
view with 'Sir Edward Grey. Sir lOd
ward in replying to tiiis attack, while
admitting important disclosures of
policy ought first. t'» he made to Par­
liament, urged that, a crisis might

The speaker said that if the war
had to be continued until Constantin­
ople fell or until the unknown obli­
gations to
allies

the country ought to he told what
those obligations are, and if there
was no essential difference between
Germany and (Iteat Britain and no
such obligations, the government
ought to take the earliest possibility
to press for the close of the war.

ambassadors today by Acting Secre­
tary Polk, of the State Department.
The documents were signed by Sec­

has been ill for several days.
The United States reiterates in
more vigorous terms its objection to
the seizure and detention of legiti­

Bluebells carpet the ground beneath the four great, oaks in Helm's
grove at Lake Forest, 111. It was hare when* the bluebells an? so thick
and fragrant, that Marian 'Lambert's body was found in February.
The flower-carpeted nook was the favorite playground of Lake Forest
children, but this spring the bluebells are fading on their stems.
"That's where Marian died," frightened children whisper to each other
as they hurry past, the spot where Marian 'Lambert and Will Orpet held
the fatal meeting that pnded'ln the girl's death.

Orpet regards Celeste as \his .star

But Celeste may never take the wit­
ness stand. Sinco the day shft learn­
ed of Orpel.'s arrest She has never
left her mother's home and those who
know her as a charming young teach­
er at the DeKalb Normal school have
seen nothing of h»r.
It. was only when the state sub­
poenaed her to testify that the out­
side world learned how Celestq Youk­
er has been lying near deaths' idoor.
Should Celeste's illness end fatally
Orpet's case will be damaged seri­
ously.
Though the girl has been called to
testify for the state, Orpet believes,
it is said, that her evidence may prove
that Marian Lambert had a motive
for suicide.
]f the engagement of Celeste and
Orpet is established, it is argued, a
reason for self-destruction by the jilted
sweetheart would be established.
Like Marian Lamber, Celeste Youk­
er had been a school friend of Or
pet's: their families are old friends.
During the last Christmas holidays
she was a guest at the Orpet home
in Lake Forest.
Happy in the sunshine of her first
love, she knew nothing of the shadov
said to have hung upon Marian Lam­
bert, living close by, and, ac^-ding
to state's attorney, goins througn the
agony of fear and "shame as a result
of trysts with Orpet.
What Celeste will testify, if she is
able to come to Waukegan, is puz­
zling the state as well as the defense.
Orpet seems confident, however.
