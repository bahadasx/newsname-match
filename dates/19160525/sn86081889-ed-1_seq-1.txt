END OF McCl'LLOl'GH WILL CASE.
Supreme Court Dismissed Appeal and
Nettie Andrews Golden Comes Into
disputed Possession of Farm.
The story of John McCullough
growing up from childhood in
the Gale family in Bethel town
ship, inheriting the farm and
personal property upon the death
of the Gales, and then, in turn,
willing the property to Miss Net
tie Andrews (now Mrs. Edward
Golden), has been told more than
once in the News. It has been
told that John's relatives made
an effort to break' the will main
ly upon the ground that John
was too near death's door when
he made the will to act intelli
gently, and that interested par
ties unduly influenced him in the
making of his will. All this was
threshed out in the courts of Ful
ton County, and Judge Swope
filed a decree sustaining the will.
The attorneys for the heirs
took an appeal from Judge
Swope's decision and carried the
case up to the Supreme Court.
The matter came up before that
body in Harrisburg Monday af
ternoon. ' M. R. Shaffner, Esq.,
appeared as attorney for the ex
ecutor of the will, Mr. W. B.
Ranck, on. account of the appel
lants having failed to perfect
their records, the appeal was dis
missed, and Mrs. Golden now be
comes possessed of the property
in accordance with the original
terms of the will.

SAB1UTH SCHOOL WORKERS.
Thirty Seventh Annual Convention of
the F. C. S. S. Association Held
Last Thursday and Friday.
It was a goodly assemely of S
S. workers that met in the High
School Auditorium, May 18 and
19, 1916. The convention would
have been more representative of
the schools of the County, if the
corn planting had been more ad
vanced. As it wa3, the most
earnest and devoted of the coun
ty workers were on hands, and
a large turn out of the local com
munitymadeup an audience of
from 200 to 450. The attention
wai very good except for a few
persons who were not able to se
cure coats. Forty schools re
ported. There are still about ten
schools unreported. Will the lo
cal Superintendents very kindly
report or have their secretaries
do so at the'r earliest convent
ence, as the books must be closed
on or about Jane 1, The Secre
tary cannot secure this data with
out your aid. The aim of the
State force is to increase the
nv:nl ership of the schools to
1 "0,000. In order to secure this
iir.crease, it will be necessary,
! not oniy to work for the accession
: of ne .v members, but to report,
I i-o that each school may be rep
resented and have full credit
with its numerical strength; A
compliance with thi3 request will
save the Secretary a great deal
of unnecessary work and worry.
The nominating committee re
ported the following list of of
ficers to serve for the ensuing
year who were duly elected:
President, A. U. Nace, McCon
nellsburg; Vice President, Erra
Clevenger, Hustontown, Pa. ;
Corresponding Secretary, W, C.
Patterson, M c C o n n ellsburg;
Treasurer, W. L. Nace, McCon
nellsburg; Elementary Superin
tendent, Miss Minnie Reisner; O.
A. B. C. Superintendent, Hon.
Jno. P. Sipes; Home Department
Superintendent, Mrs. C. B. Ste
vens; Teachers Training Super
intendent, Rev. Lewis Wible,
Dane, Pa. ; Temperance Superin
tendent, C. J. Brewer; Mission
ary Superintendent, Miss Blanche
Smith, Warfordsburg, R. R. 1;
Rural Schools Superintendent,
Albert K. Nesbit. Newly elect
ed officers will please note this
list.
Many schools in the County
have neglected to send in to the
Secretary their yearly offering.
Delinquent schools will kindly at
tend to this .matter. It is not a
large sum for each school, and
yet if the school wishes to be
identified with the County and
State organization, it must con
tribute its share toward the nec
essary expense of conducting the
organization.
The Convention next year will
be! held at Needmore. .

Secretary.

Who Caa Answer?
Written for the Nkwi
Why don't we take more inter
est in and read our bible more?
We are subscribing for new pa
pers, and running subscriptions
to old ones, and read almost every
thing that is in them either good
or bad, while our poor old bible
the only thing the dear Lord
could leave us when he suffered
and died for our sins is left ly
,ing on the shelf covered with
dust and perhaps untouched or
only skimmed thru. It should
be read daily and meditated over
hourly. He has left this blessed
book for us to study and believe,
so that when the last great day
comes, we "may have our lesson
learned and be able to stand be
fore the Master as learned and
obedient scholars.
Oh ! yes, if we were going to
mingle in some great society,
we would have our etiquette book
studied and committed so that
we would not make one mistake
Then, why don't we take more
interest in reading the Book our
salvation and eternity depends
on ? Think reader, of that great
word ETERNITY! What does
it picture to you ? Are you a
reader of the bible, and have you
your lesson learned well and your
ticket bought and know that you
are on the railroad that leads to
heaven ? Or, are you rushing
recklessly on the train to distruc
tion ?
Was it in vain God sacrificed
his only son for you ?

Property Improvement,
Miss Mary Daniels, who owns
the Old Shimer property on West
Lincoln Way, is having a third
story placed on the stone end of
the building which will add very
much to the appearance of the
property and to the convenience
and comfort of the occupants.
The room on the first floor of
the stone end, is occupied by
Robert N. Shimer as a tailoring
establishment the same room
that was occupied sixty years ago
by his grandfather Samuel Shi
mer as a saddler and harness
shop.
Will Leave St. Cloud.
A recent letter from C. H.
Mann, St. Cloud, Fla., states
that he is about to close out his
business at that place. It will
be remembered that Mr. Mann
went to Florida from Saluvia two
or three years ago in the hope
that a change in climate would
be beneficial to his health. In
this he h&s been disappointed,
and now he finds that he must
seek a higher altitude.

Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Malaria is said to have hasten
ed the down-fall of Rome. The
mosquitoes which transmitted it
were more deadly to the inhabi
tants of the Imperial city than
their barbarian enemies. Much
has also been written of similar
injury to Greece in yet earlier
times.
At least two diseases are car
ried by certain species of mos
quitoes, malaria and yellow fever
All species are disagreeable pests
that often make Nature's most
attractive spots untenantable.
Have you unwittingly permit
ted mosquitoes . to breed about
your house or grounds? Even
one old tomato can half filled
by the spring rains makes an
ideal breeding ground. It is sur
prising how many hidden pools
one can find around a place if
you really go on a hunt. Not in
frequently drain pipes become
clogged and then tin roof3 and
gutters afford an unsuspected
breeding place for thousands of
mosquitoes.
Communities that suffer from
these pests should co-operate to
campaign effectively against
them. Even the smallest adja
cent pools should be filled up or
ditched and drained. If these
are too large to be filled they
should be treated with petrolum.
This floats atop the water and
kills the mosquito larvae by shut
ting off the atmosphere. When
the wind causes a movement of
the water which breaks up the
oil coating it must be re-oiled.
Swamps can be similarly treated.
A survey should be made of all
premises. Rain water barrels
should be covered. Tin cans or
discarded vessels on rubbish piles
should be perforated, smashed
flat or buried.
