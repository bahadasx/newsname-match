, Oppression, libel, and black
mail are charged against former
Congressman George A. Neeley
by Mrs. Mary Stamm, whom be
recently sued for $10,833.33 on a
contract lor legal advice. In the
cross petition and answer filed
yesterday in District court by
Martin & Martin and Judge C.
E. Branine, attorneys for the de
fendant, - Mrs. Stamm asks
$10,000 damages from Neeley as
the result of the course he has
pursued in the case she placed
in bis bauds.
Neeley 's suit, filed in district
court last week, cited a contract
signed by Mrs. Stamm when she
sought his advice regarding her
standing in the eyes of the law
with her then common law bus
band. Neeley claimed she
agreed toand did sign a contract,
to pay him one-third of any sum
he might procure for her, either
in or out of court. Mr. and Mrs.
Stamm, prominent for years jn
social and business circles here,
were married last October in
Denver and they refused to pay
tbe tnira interest ' in Mrs,
Stamm 'b portion of" Stain m's
property, which 'is valued at
$35,000.
Mrs. Stamm asserts in her
petition that sbe has" never bad
any legal dealings and did not
understand tbe phraseology of
the contract she signed ' when
Neeley read it to her. Sbe as
serts that Neeley read nothing
about signiog one-third of her
rights to him. She further' as
serts that the said George A.
Neeley knew, or by . reasonable
care and dilligence ought to have
known, that the defendant's
right to inherit was tbe same as
if she had been formerly married
and the plaintiff concealed this
information from the defendant
for the purpose of fraudulently
and wrongfully inducing her . to
sign the papers,'- -
, Mrs. Stamm is German, , and
in her petition says she is illiter
ate from an English standpoint
and can hardly speak or under
stand English, except in simple
matters. Hutchinson Gazette,
May 24.
Tbe above only exposes anoth
er of Neeley's many crooked
tricks, this time to defraud an
unadvised, unsuspecting, illiter
ate woman. -

his car went off of the fill and
turned over, throwing its occu
pant beneath it, but fortunately
without injury.
