of the failure of their efforts to ob

The entente allies endeavored vain

overland to the Saloniki front. They

GERMANS CLAIM
ILL TREATMENT
ncapacited Soldiers Sent Home
From France Complain of -Mob
Abuse and Arbi
trary Officers.
Berlin, May 25, by wireless to Say
ville N. Y. An account of tho treat
ment of German prisoners in France,
said to have been obtained from in
capacitated German soldiers who have
been sent home in exchange for
French prisoners, is published today
in the Nordcutsche Allgemelno Zel
tung. "All of them complain of abuse
from fanatical mobs and of the arbi-
the French camps, who pay no appar
ent attention to Instructions," the
newspaper says. "This may be due
to the fact that the French war min
ister does not exercise sufficiently
close supervision of the prison campB.
Wounded Prisoners Not Returned.
"Severely wounded prisoners in sev-l
eral camps were not exchanged, al-l
though they were only able to move I
about on crutches. This fact explains
why no prisoners were sent home
from the camps at Amiens, St. Brleuc,
Belleville, Blaye, Toulouae and North
ern Africa, nor from Marseilles.
"Virtually all the prisoners returned
in rags. In several cases it was
pointed out that clothing sent from
home was withheld from them. Spe
cial complaints were lodged against
tho commander and an interpreter at
camp Borcelouette, who put the
wounded to hard labor. It was fur
ther stated that In several cases
Frenchmen were seen wearing trous
ers which had been sent from Ger
many for the imprisoned Germans
The railroad station of Brunalr, situ
ated nearby, has been filled with
parcels sent from Germany.
Officers Punish Germans.
"Complaints were made by the ex
changed prisoners regarding the camp
at Sundudun, where non-commissioned
officers are given the right to
punish prisoners with arrest. In camp
Maselesti the prison room is too
small for lying down. It is only pos
sible for a soldier to sit. At the same
camp parcels sent from Germany are
ransacked by the guards. The in
terpreters have cupboards filled with
stolen cigars and other things.
"In the camp at Nevers the prison
ers were forced to work hard even on
Sunday. In La Palllce the food was
exceedingly poor. Prisoners were
forced to send home forged letters.
Profesional Men at Hard Labor.
"Further complaints were made by
the soldiers regarding the kind of
work which captured professors, law
yers, artists and clergymen were
forced to do, such as unloading ships
and repairing roads .canals and rail
road tracks.
"The French government when
asked to change these arrangements,
replied that it was impossible be
cause of French democratic ideas. The
French government also declined to
transfer war prisoners from the un
healthy North African climate.
French In Russian Swamps.
"Apparently in answer to the Ger
man request French newspapers now
publish the news that captured
French have been employed in the
Russian swamps. It is semi-officially
stated here that this report is true.
Frenchmen employed in the occupied
parts of Russia are In a much better
position than are the Germans who
must spend a second summer in the
hot, unhealthy North African climate
and who are forced to work hard un
der miserable conditions."

Grand Jury Brings True Bills
Against Sir Roger Casement
and Daniel J. Bailey.
London, May 25, 12:40 p m. The
grand jury today returned true bills
against Sir Roger Casement, leader
of the Sinn Fein revolt, and Daniel J.
Bailey, the former British soldier who
is held as his accomplice.
The action of the grand jury fol
lows the preliminary hearing before
police magistrate at which Casement
and Bailey withheld their defense and
were held without bail pending the
grand jury deliberations.
Seventy-five grand jurors were
summoned before selected to decide
whether indictments for high treason
should be returned against tho two
prisoners. Their decision was reached
promptly.
Little interest in oasement.
Dublin, May 25, 10:43 a. m. As
tonishingly little interest is displayed
hero in the trial of Sir Roger Case
ment both in political and general cir
cles. Casement was almost entirely
unknown here before the war. Since
then vague reports of his activities
in Germany have been all that have
reached the Irish public in spite of
the fact that he was in touch with
the leaders of the recent rebellion.
As an element in Irish politics Case
ment had no existence The Import
ance attached to his connection with
the Sinn Fein revolt both in England
and abroad is not quite understood In
this country.

VIGOROUS NOTE

Language Almost Equal in
Force to Ultimatum to Ger
many Cabled to France

NO CONCESSION MADE
Belligerents Have No Right to
Even Inspect First Class.
Mails in Transit on
High Seas.
Washington, May 25 Vigorous lan
guage, equalling almost that employed
in the last communication to Germany
on the submarine issue, is understood
to characterize tho notes delivered to
the British and French embassies here
yesterday protesting against interfer
ence with neutral mails on these char
ges It it understood there Is no substan
tial difference as to principle between
the state department and the London
and Paris chancellors regarding the
broad question of inviolability of first
class mails on the high seas The
American objection is based rather on
the methods employed by the allied
governments in handling these mails.
No Concessions Made.
The United States does not concede
the right to even inspect first class
mails in transit on the high seas, as
suming that these do not Include anj'
thing more than correspondence and
are not made the vehicle for supply of
contraband to the belligerents. The
fact that a neutral vessel carrying
mails between neutral countries is
compelled to come into a belligerent
port to comply with belligerent naval
rules, it is held, does not remove the
mail matter on board from the privil
eged character of mail on the high
seas.
Strong Resolution Offered.
A esolutionuCuonzing" "trans
portation of mail to and from neutral
ports on naval vessels and declaring
that "any interference with our mails
shall be resented by such ships with
all the power of the navy and of the
ships," was introduced today by Repre
sentative Tague of Massachusetts. It
was referred to a committee.

ELECT EDITORS
Balloting Begins for Heads of
Twelve or More' Religious
Magazines.
' Saratoga Springs, N. Y.. May 25.
The Methodist general conference re
fused today by a vote of 435 to 360 to
remove from the discipline of the
church the clause which provides the
penalty of expulsion for church mem
bers who play cards, dance and at
tend the theater
Chancellor James R. Day of Syra
cuse, who presented a report request
ing elimination of tne clause, propos
ed the substituting of a warning which
he characterized as the "strongest
pronouncement the Methodist Epis
copal church has ever made to the
world on this question." He asserted
this was sufficient to make the posi
tion of the church clear as opposed to
these amusements.
Frank Ncff of Tulsa, Okla., who
spoke for the majority report insist
ed that removal of tho prohibition was
equivalent to weakening the position
of tho ichurch.
The foreign and colored delegates
voted almost solidly against any
lia.jlfc,C nunc IIIU Jll ILlMllliXl OU)liuil,

Saratoga Springs, iST. Y., May 25.
The general conference of the Metho
dist Episcopal church today began
balloting for tho editors of twelve or
more religious magazines published
under the direction of the church in
many parts of the country. Tho can
didates are recommended by delegates
from the sectional area in which the
pnpers are published, but are elected
by tho entire conference.
Final action was also taken on a re
port which re-organizes the depart
ment of home missions and church ex
tension by placing the work under the
charge of one corresponding secretary
who Is the executive 'head.
From now until final adjournment
early next week, tho conference will
be in practically continuous session
day and night for tho purpose of dis
posing of large numbers of proposals
principally of a routine nature.
More Stringent Marriage
Regulations.
More stringent regulations regard
ing tho re-marriage by Methodist min
isters of divorced persons are pro
vided in a report submitted by the
committee on the stato of tho church.
Tho church has never recognized any
cause for divorce except adultery and
has always forbidden re-marriage in
any case where a divorced wife or
husband Is living. By the proposed
change a mini&tei; -h,o performs such
a marriage is guilty of maladministra
tion and is to be held answerable to
his conference.
Tho total abstinence by Methodist
church members from tho use of to
bacco is urged in another report
which states:
"We record our solemn judgment
that the habitual use ok tobacco is a
practice out of harmony with the best
Christian life."
Pob'gamy and the social evil are
condemned by the committee on tem
perance and public morals. The en
forcement of the laws prohibiting the
former is urged. ,
Social Evil Report.
' Regarding the social evil the com
mittee asserts that neither segrega
tion nor punishment by fines Is a
remedj'. The community should offi
cially expel and disperse vice, it con
tinues, and the state should provide
industrial settlements for the mental
ly deficient and an honest place in
society for those mentally capable.
"Parents and others charged with
care of tho young ought to give care
ful consideration to the proper educa
tion of our youth to the end that
there may bo health of body, purity
of mind""and righteousness of life,"
the report concludes. Action will be
taken later.
