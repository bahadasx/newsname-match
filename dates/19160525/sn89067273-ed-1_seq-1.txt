of restraint. First that of command
ruling in the realm of conscience and
which made God supreme. Second,
the restraint of environment, which
rules in the realm of social inter
course. A man s friends determine
largely what he is. The Book of
Proverbs shows young men the pow
er of association both good and bad.
Third, the restraint of affection rul
ing in the realm of feeling and emo

wife has held many from a destruc

means a purpose in life which if ad

HOUCHIN SPEAKS.
Hon. James A. Houchin, candidate
for Governor on the Democratic
ticket, made a speech at the Mexico
Court House Tuesday night. He had
a very close and attentive hearing
and made a fine impression. Houcbin
has a good platform. He believes
the State government should be ad
ministered just like a successful
business man would run his own
private business not how much of
the people's money he could spend
but how much he cviuid save. He is
opposed to nepotism. Thinks the
auto tax should build three good per
manent roads' across every county of
the State. He would look after the
schools and see that every poor boy
and girl had a chance for a Univer
sity education.
Houchin makes wme timely sug
gestions about the government over
at Jeffeson City. The Message thinks
well of Houchin.

WOODCRAFT STOIES
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
(Plot Made By Children in Room Number 3, Central School.)
Eighth Story. 1 ;
By L. Roy Ferris.
The sarvis trees were loaded with bright red berries,
just the color of little sister's cheeks, and Red Squirrel
was happy. For didn't he have all the bright red berries
he could eat, and he could take home both cheeks full to
the six dear little babes in the tree nest. "Yum, yum",
how good they do taste in a pie, but of course Red Squirel
doesn't eat pie. If he ate pie crust he would be pale like
some little boys, that is, if anybody baked them but moth
er, for she always bakes the nicest things and they don't
hurt a fellow unless he steals them out of the pantry.
Just as Red Squirrel was about to hurry home by the
tree-top route along comes Sister Muskrat with a bunch
of tender sarvis berry branches, that Red Squirrel had
thoughtfully dropped into the creek for the Muskrat fam
ily. And Red Squirrel hadn't pulled the berries off, eith
er. Just to show you now kina
ew berries into the water
and her seventv-three children, eat them. Makes a fellow
feel good to do a kindness, doesn't? Well, about this time,
just as Sister Muskrat reached
Father Muskrat was trailing

Muskrats always did the same way Brother Bull Frog
and eve ryone of the Bull Frog Song Club jumped on the
pile of red berries. Funny
at anything red. Just then
ing a nap on a limb overhanging the water growled and
showed his teeth.
"What is the matter, Bobcat," asked Brother Terra
pin, won t you ever get in a good humor r Why don t
you keep still like King Fisher over there in that old dead
tree:"
"Aw," growls Bobcat. "AH he has to do is to dig a
hole in the bank for a home for his wife and babies, and
then sit in the sun and watch for a fish to come swimming
along, and then he pounces upon him and takes him home
for dinner. I reached over a log and dangled my paws in
the water two hours and din't catch a thing but a small
crawfish and I don't like crawfish anvwav. Besides I hear
mething that sounds queer. Listen for yourself.
"And, sure enough, like the Turtle family falling off
a log, it went "splash, splash." Bobcat showed his teeth
and wiggled his little bobtail and crouched down on the
limb just like he was going to jump. Terrapin whispered
to Red Squirrel who was near, "Run up there and tell
Bobcat to behave, and tell him to remember what happen
ed to Slim. Weasel."
When Red Squirrel had done so Bobcat became quiet
and Red Squirrel ran to his
rest of the musicians jumped
ety plump," and Fatty Brown Bear almost fell out of the
sarvis berry tree getting down.
"Sh-sh, whispered Muskrat, it s the Camp Boy in
his canoe."
Sure enough, there was
dled he looked over where Fatty Brown Be ar was trying
to hide and smiled. But I am not sure he saw Fatty, are
you r
Straight toward the big sycamore went the canoe.
"Ah," said the Camp Boy.
"Whe-ee-oo," sobbed the Fox.
And what do you think the Camp Boy did? He reach
ed thru the trap and gently
1 am not sure but 1 think there were tears in Red Fox s
eyes, at least Muskrat, who
the Lamp boy opened the door and gently shoved Red
Fox out, and he was free. As Brother Rabbit took to his
heels, Red Fox took one long look at the Camp Boy and
disappeared into the woods.
"I hope he has learned a lesson," remarked Sister
Possum.
TO TAX AUTOS.
The City Council is proposing an
ordinance to tax all horse drawn
and motor drawn vehicles owned in
the city; $1.50 a year to be placed
against all single horse vehicles;
$3.00 on two horse wagons; $3.00
on automobiles under 25 horse pow
er, and $5.00 on autos having more
than 25 horse power. For failing to
report your vehicle and paying the
tax you will be liable to a fine of not
less than $1.00 nor more than $100.
Take to the country, boys, with
your autos. Not a big tax; you don't
want to dodge it, but a little encour
agement of the back to the farm
movement wou't hurt.
