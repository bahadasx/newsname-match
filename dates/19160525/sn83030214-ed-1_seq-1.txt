Replies to Demands
in Commons.
lan, May 24. In an impr
? peerh -,n the Ho'ise flf t'ommo-. ? i
night, Sir Fdward Grey. the B.itish
-r Secretary, set aside all ideas
that peace nejjotlations were possible
at present. Sir F.dward's ppeech was
made in rep'y to Arthur Ponaonhy. Lib?
eral Member for Btirlir.g, Scotland, who
strongly a'tacked the government for
allowing diplomatic etiquette to stand
. in the way of possible peace negotia?
tions and for "emplnyjng the American
press as a platform."
t Edward declared that it was Im

without a previous ajrreement between
nteate Allies. He declared that
the hflltilitifll had not yet reached a
"\age where it waa poaaible to talk of
peace, especially aa the German public
waa cotiHtan.ly being "fed with lie~" by
its miniat. i
Mr. I'onsonby's references to 'he use
' of the American press as a "platform"
waa the outgrowth of a recent. inter
riow arith Sir K.dward Grey. Sir Fd
ii replying to this attack, whrle
admiuirrg that important disciosures of
nol'.cy ought flrat to be made to Par?
liament, areued that a crisis might
arise during the war when considera
tiona of etiquette anould not be al?
lowed to stand in the way. He con
tended that, since German statesmen
constantly were giving interview* and

Mr. Ponsonby argued flfaias! pro

fell or un'il the unknown oblipat runx
to the Allies were fulfllled. the coun

"ations were, and that if there were
no flflflflBtikl differences between Ger?
many an.l (ireat Hritain, and no auch

Ponsonby aaked.
"We ought not to allow diplomatic

Sfrong'-t investiga''on of charu.ies to
escape service. and methods of making
away with papers de*rr,bed ss "dam
aging" are chief topirs of discussion
between Father William B. Farrell and
Dr. Danlel C. Potter, as disclosed by
the cryptle "teiephone tapa" given out
by Mayor Mitchel yesterday.
An entry on Marrh 21 credits Potter
with saying to aSecretary Dineen:
"I spoke to Hebberd and he told me
that everything waa In wild alarm.
They're trying to get Into the game
there by expoalng me, but I had very
carefully all the papers removed this
morralng from my office and put Into a
safe plare."
Dineen Po they know where
you are?
Potter I'm in Philadelphia and
all over, but still I'm at home.
Dineen Have they served you
w'th a subpoana?
I'otter No; there's nobodv here
an.l there was r.obodv around here,
either. Hebberd fears the identifi ?
cation n? the pamphlet, but no fear
of that; he is mcommunicado.
Potter is ree-orded as telephoning te
Father Farrell on the morning
,,*'
March 21 and utrering thia -.varning
about thfl papers in his desk:
Potter I heard from Hebberd this
morning and he said they are going
to make further inveetigation. They
are going deeper, and he aaid I
ahould get everything out of sight at
home and in the offlce and remove all
tho atnff. I don't know how I am
going to get. back into my place. I
have the papers all locked in the
desk. but tha* will nor hinder them
from obtaining a warrant under false
pretenres and get all the papers.
Farrell Are they of any valua to
them?
Potter Certainly.
Farrell Suppose I send Mike Mi?
chael Riley, Father Farrell's secre?
tary] over to you and you give him
initructions and he can go to the of?
fice and bring all the stutf out of
there.
Potter?We must stick tight, be?
cause they are going through this
thing deaperately. 1 really don't
know 4?hat 1 am going to do abtiut
thoae papers in my desk in the ofliae.
Farrell We will stay indoors all
day.
An entry on March 22 shows Potter
giving Father Farrell thia warning to
evade process servers:
Potter Well, this is Potter.
Person i who answered from 1457,
Farrell's teiephone) I knew who it
was.
Potter Ycu tell him to ke-?p out of
the way, as the process servers were
just here looking for us.
Person They didn't get you, ajld
they?
Potter No, I'm in Philadelphia.
Father Farrell's alleged efforts to ai,l
Potter in getting out of the city are re
\ealeel in this conversation, dated
March 21:
Farrell?I'll aend yoa $5e and you
alip away thia afternoon. III aend it
over with Mike, and I'll aend the ad
dress of my sister and you will write
there, and she will bring the letter
over to me.
Potter Yes, I guess It's kind of
dangerous to stay here.
Farrell Yes, you take a trip to
Atlantic City, or some other place
and III look out for you.
On the lame date Potter is alleged to
have received this promise of $100 from
Monsignor Dunn to be used for fhe
same purpose:
Dunn?Well. I'll tell yoa what I'll
do.. I'll give >ou $IQ4?. (an>ousend
aome one up for it?
Potter Yea, I gueas ie* Where
will I send for it?
Dunn L'p at the ehancellery.
Later in the day Monsignor Dunn
is shown to have told of some myi
terious "He," otherwise unnamed, who
was said to be going to see the Cardi?
nal. Tiie conversation, as recorded.ia:
Monsignor Dunn Hello! Thia ia
Monsignor.
Potter Hello!
Dunn He's going to see the Cardi?
nal, and he'a likely to atay there all
afternoon. so I don't suppose I can
iee him before night.
Potter Well, I suppose we'l! have

Clergy Clique in Dialogue?"Cut-Ins"
Made Daily, He Admits.
Mayor Mitchel on the witness stand hefore the Thompson
Committee yesterday said the next move of the city oflicials
against certain Roman Catholic priests and laymen and a small
number of non-Catholics would he criminal prosecution.
"It il not the Catholic Church whieh has conspired to per
vert justice and obstruct or control government." said Mayor
Mitchel. "but a small group within the Church co-operating
with a few non-Catholic laymen."
After he returned last night to the City Hall, where the
Mayor found scores of letters from well known men congratutat
ing him on his stand. he received the reporters. When asked
to detail the plan he and other city ofticials have in mind for
prosccuting those who?to use the Mayor's Ianguage?conspired
to obstruct the due administration of laws and interfere with
povernment, he said:
"I really don't know. We have not yet decided on ? plan.
We are now holding a conference to decide on some course. But
' you can rest assured that there will be criminal action. Put just
how or when I cannot say now."
Mayor and Aids Confer.
At this conference were Charities Commissioner Kings?
bury. his first deputy, Joseph Doherty; I__.mar Hardy. Corpora
ition Counsel. and Police Commissioner Woods.
The Mayor believes that criminal action on three separate
f.-'lonies and one misdemeanor can be prosecuted.
These are: Perjury. criminal libel, conspiracy to utter a
criminal libel and conspiracy to prevent and obstruct justice
and the due administration of the law.
No writer of a Drury Lane melodrama ever had at hi?* dis
p.isal better material for an hour of dramatie intensity than
that aft'orded by the scene in the coroners' court room yester?
day. attendant upon the Mayor's taking the witness stand.
It was exaetly 4:30 o'clock when the Mayor took the stnnd.
After hours of executive sessions the committee decided to
hear him tell the conversations he alleges the police overhcard
when they tapped the telephone wires of Father William B.
Farrell, rector of the Roman Catholic Church of SS. Peter and
Paul; Dr. Daniel C. Potter, a former Methodist minister, and
the dispenser of public moneys to private charitable institu
tions under Mavor Craynor, and his son, Dean Potter.
