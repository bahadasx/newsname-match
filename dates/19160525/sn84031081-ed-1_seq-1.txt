Convention Well Attwitlftl.
The fonventlon was one' of th
most largely utlendijd that the demo
crats have ever held In New'Mexico,
and enthusiasm and ennfldenco were
apparent on ull sides. A note of su
premo assurance of victory ran
through all the speeches that wera
made, and whether their confidence
Is well founded o'v not, there was no
doubt that (he delegates from tho va
rious counties fuiiy believe that this
lis a democratic year In boih the state
! ,irul 1 Ul: nation.
I Aside from the remarkable ovation
given Mr. Junes, the feature of tho
convention was (be enthusiasm
shown at every mention of the tin ma
of Wood row Wilson and the out
standing fact that together with Mr.
Jones the real leader., iilp of the dem
ocratic party at the present time
seems to r. d with Governor McDon-
aid. Senator Isaac r.arlh and Sena
tor W. It. Walton. All three of these
gentlemen tame In tor enthusiast lo
cheering on every possible occasion.
(and this apparently without any ref
bothit r. mu to the possible- candidacy' of
d byieiiher of the three for any office.
There was little to indicate the
j pr, fei-ence of the delegates regarding
tho governorship. References to tho
, adiiiliitHtr.itb.il of Governor McDonald
and praise for the policies he baa
pursued were bcartilv cheered', but no
less so 'ban the appearance on tho
; stage of Senator Earth, who is recog
