test were enjoyed and in the con
test the prize wa. presented to
Charles Plumb, the Senior presi
dent The two-course banquet

given to the classes by Mr. Twen

It Has Arrived.
Baxter Spring, i. not coming;
the arrival i. hereby announced.
The old burg i. taking on an air
of activity. Building, are going
up, and property i. changing
band.. The big mineral strike,
which have been made right up
next to the town, and which, by
the way, extend clear out to
Pirher, have put Baxter Springs
on the map of the investor.
All that is now needed to make
the town what it ought to be is
a sewer system and rapid transit
between the town and the mm
ing camps. The rapid transit
will be built this summer.
At least three propositions are
virtually up to our people look
ing to thi. end, and either one i.
good enough, if it i. built. True,
it i. going to cost the. town some
money to get what it need, in
thi. line, but what if it doe.?
All good thing, cost money, and
only the miserly do dot want to
pay for what they get. Baxter
Spring, stands ready to pay the
cost, and the cost will not hurt
anybody. The people of Baxter
Springs are ready to get right
up in the collar and pay what is
necessary. The day of the lag'
gard has gone by. No attention
is paid nowadays to carping
critics and knockers. Nothing
can be gained by giving heed to
them, and everything can be
gained by giving them-a wide
berth.
Baxter Springs is going to be
the best town of its size in the
world. Nothing can hold it back.
