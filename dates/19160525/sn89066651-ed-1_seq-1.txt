OLD FRIENDS.
JofT Alexandor of Point Pleas
ant came down Saturday to visit
Ids old friends, P. A. Mayes and
VV. P. Men tte. "Uncle" JeiT told
us that he and the Doctor had
been close friends for the past
10 years, and that he was going
to get a stick after the editor if
he. didn't see something in the
Herald about the Doctor every
week. We greatly enjoyed our
conversation with Mr. Alexander
and extend to him an invitation
to call around at this office at any
time. Of course before Mr.
Alexander left he renewed his
subscription to the Herald and
paid for it in advance, too.
SCHOOL PICNIC.
The fifth annual school picnic
was held on the school campus,
Friday, May 111. and as usual
was a wry enjoyable affairs. The
children began to gather early
and spent the entire morning in
one continued recess. The par
ents were rather late in coming
but there were a good many by
noon, and as usual, room number
three, the lunch room, was so
well tilled with heavy, heaped
baskets that every one was sniff
ing hungrily in that direction.
The Hiiyti Hussar Band, of
which every citizen of Hayti is
justly proud was there and fur
nished excellent music. And
just here, the corps of teachers
asks us to say that they have
their sincere thanks for their
willingness to help the school in
every way possible at all times.
Because the crowd was so slow
in assembling the regular march

by many people in the city and at
which many kodaks were aimed.

the children until they were out

baskets which the men brought
out and upon tiic return of the
pupils the tables were heavily

After dinner everyone went to
the north -ide of the building i
watch the annual Maypole Dance
by a number of little children.
This was a very enjoyable feature
of the well arranged program
and a very beautiful one as well.
Just before the dance began the
little children gave a little play

When this interesting affair
was concluded the crowd moved
to the east side of the building to
witness the races and contests.
These were all a source of pleas

SEVEN YEARS AGO.
The Dowd and Gayoso school
districts has been merged to

sum of $li)(X), and a contract for
the erection of a building had
been let. Then the school build
ing was safe from the overflow
of the great Father of Waters,
now, since the new loop on the
levee at that point, it practically
destroys the usefullness of that
institution. It is hoped that the
building may bo moved in the
near future on this side of the
levee.
Concord and Dry Bayou school
districts had also voted bonds for
new school buildings. Dry
Bayou was to get a $1200 build
ing, and concord got a si.iu
building. Education in Pemiscot
county was then awakening, and
lias ever since been on the gains
for f uther advancements.

livery business in this city. He

YOUR CHANCE TO PRO
TECT YOURSELF WHILE
THERE IS YET TiME
TN the midst of so much talk everywhere
about merchandise going higher we are
still offering good, wanted, dependable mer
chandise at the same old prices, and in
many instances lower than present whole
sale prices. There has hardly been a day
lately that we have not been notified about
all kinds of Dry Goods becoming scarcer
and higher. But here you can find what
you want most, the very articles that have
become so scarce, at the same price you
paid for them a year or more ago. For your
protection we wish to announce that we
positively will not raise our prices on a
single article until our present stock is ex
hausted. Anticipating a great advance in
prices we bought very heavy for this sea
son, and our store is full of thousands of
of value-giving articles, and you will find
it worth your time to call here for what you
need in Dry Goods, Clothing, Shoes, Men's,
Ladies' and Children's Ready-to- ear.
We wish to call special attention to our large line of
Rugs, Matting, etc. Call and inspect these goods.
