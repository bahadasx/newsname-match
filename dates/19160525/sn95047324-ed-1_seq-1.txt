Dixie Highway to Follow
Route of Tamiami Trail
The route of the Dixie High
way through Lee county is assur
ed, the Dixie Highway Associa
tion having unanimously voted to
include the Lee county route in
the routing of the main Dixie
Highway at a meeting held re
cently at French Lick. Notifica
tion of the action of the associa
tion was received .yesterday by
F. W. Perry, chairman of the
county council of the Dixie High
way association in Lee county,
and it is held by those familiar
with the highway situation in
Florida as directly attributable
to Mr. Perry's activity and to W.
S-. Gilbreath, field secretary of
the national association, who vis
ited Fort Myers several months
ago and has not lost an opportun
ity to boost Lee county and . this
immediate section of the state.
The letter notifying the local
council of the action of the asso
ciation is as follows:

Dear Sir: At the French Lick
meeting of the Dixie Highway
association the following resolu
tion was passed unanimously.
"On motion of Mr. Gordon, the
directors from Florida were auth

the Tamiami Trail as a part of
the Dixie Highway on receipt of
a sufficient guarantee of a first

Central Florida Highway Asso
ciation when it meets in Orlando.
It is the annual meeting of the
good roads body and much work
aside from the election of officers
is also planned. The date of
meeting was decided upon.
Possibilities of having the Dix
ie. Highway re-routed to go a
round those counties which re
fuse to make improvements are
being held out. The dilatory
counties ar. along the western
loop of the big international high
way, nssording to L. P. Dickie,
secretary of the Central Florida
.Highway Association. One of
the most interesting meetings in
the history of the association is
looked forward to.
This notice in the Tampa Tri
bune is of vital interest to our
people" here in Punta Gorda. The
resolution providing for the re
routing of the Dixie Highway,
M'here bonds or taxes are not vot
ed to provide for same, secures
for Punta Gorda the main route
of the Dixie Highway. This was
gotten through at Ocala by Pres.
Perry of the Ft. Myers Board of
Trade and A. B Tucker of Punta
Gorda.
Our part of the highway is now
in travelable shape and can be re
ported at the Orlando meeting on
June 22nd as ready for traffic.

board." f
Being informed from several
sources that bond issues have
been secured, I am writing to ask
that you send to myself and Mr.
S. A. Belcher, commissioners for
Florida, such evidence as you
may have in regard to the above
as to the certainty of this route
being completed within a reason
able time.
As soon as I receive such evi
dence from you I will at once ap
ply to the head office of our asso
ciation to have this route proper
ly designated and shown upon all
future wans of the route of the
Dixie Highway.
With every desire to serve you,
I beg to remain,
Yours very truly,
G. W. SAXON,
Vice President ; for Florida,
Dixie Highway Association.
The routs of the Tamiami Trail
as geneially accepted is from
Tampa through Hillsborough and
Manatee counties to Punta Gor
da, from Punta Gorda to Olga, on
the Caloosahatchee, thence to Ft.
Myers and through Lee county to
the Dade county line, then con
necting with the highway under
construction and running to Mi
ami. In explanation of the progress
of the highway development a
long the route the following in
formation has been foi warded by
Mr. Perry to Mr George Saxon,
Florida Commissioner oi the Dix
ie Highway.
Replying to your favor of the
15th instant, I take pleasure in
giving you the following informa
tion : .
First, taking up Lee rounty's
portion of Tamiami trail: Begin
ning at the line between DeSoto
and Lee counties there .ire ap
proximately six miles of road be
tween the county line and the Ol
ga bridge. This little stretch of
road is now under construction,
and will be completed before. next
winter. From the Olga bridge
to Fort Myers there is a fairly
good road, hard-surficed, which
needs some repairs, but which
cars can travel at all seasons with
no difficulty, except that the road
is a little rough. It is the inten
tion of the community, through
which this stretch of road passes,
to, rebuild it within the near fu
ture.
A bond issue has been provided
for the construction of the road
from Fort Myers to Marco and
the grading is nearly completed
for this entire distance. Bids
will be opened for surfacing next
month.
A bond issu" has been provid
ed for the construction of a road
from Marco to the Dade county
line where it will connect with
Dade county's road from Miami.
I understand that Dade county's
part of this through road is now
under construction under a sub
stantial bond issue. Mr. Belcher
will correct jne if I am in error,
'as to that point.
Lest you may not be fully ad
vised as to the progress of the
Tamiami Trail in southern DeSo
to county, I am in a position to
state on the best of authority,
that from the Lee county line first
mentioned, to Punta Gorda, the
grade of the npad is complete, and
a substantial bond issue has been
voted for surfacing this road to
gether with constructing a bridge
across Peace river at Punta Gor
da, and including also the con
struction of about eight miles of
road between the north of this
bridge and the Manatee county
line.
Manatee county has voted
bonds to construct the connecting
link between DeSoto county and
the system of roads already built
or in process of construction lead
ing to Tampa.
The road running northward
from Punta Gorda to Arcadia has
been much improved and addi
tional work is being done on it at
this time. I presume DeSoto
county representatives will give
you correct and complete data re
garding the link last mentioned.

Summer Garden Varies Diet
Why not plant a good summer
garden? Many people think it
impracticable to "raise summer
vegetables in Florida. W. L.
Floyd, professor of horticulture
in the University of Florida, sug
gests gardens to furnish a varia
ble diet during the hot summer
months. A large number of veg
etables grow well during summer
and everybody should have at
least some of them.
Professor Floyd says that field
corn planted at intervals of sev
eral weeks will give roasting ears
during most of the summer. The
corn with white kernels is pre
ferred by most people.
Okra is a true hot weather
plant and with proper care will
Dear all summer. The aphis or
plant louse is troublesome but
can be controlled by the use of to
bacco extract.
The eggplant is another hot
season plant and is very easy to
raise. Peppers are about as easy
to raise as eggplant and are cared
for in about the same manner.
There are several types of
beans that are adapted to the
summer garden, such as pole,
lima, both bush and climbing, and
the old fashioned butter bean,
the candidate does not go on the
primary ballot, which will tend
to simplify matters somewhat.
Forty -eight candidates have
qualified to run in the June elec
tion for- county offices. Candi

Almost every garden contains
sweet potatoes but they are usual
ly late maturing ones. If early
slips are used a much earlier crop
can be had. By sending to some
grower who makes a business of
raising slips for early markets one
can have potatoes in June. The
triumph and jersey are two of the
early types of sweet potatoes. j
During the hot months a mess
of greens sometimes tastes good
and a planting of collards ' will
satisfy this hunger.
Better Cattle Can be Raised in
Florida
A few years ago the idea
of improving native stock was
poohpoohed. Cattle raisers
thought that the Florida steer
coukl not be improved profitably.
Then, too, there was little incen
tive for stockmen to build up
their herds under open free range
conditions. There have been a
few men, however, who believed
that improvement could be made
profitably. During the last fif
teen years they have demonstrat
ed what can be done by bringing
in good blood.
These men have succeeded in
The Outstanding Facts
in the Mexican Situation
Washington, D. C Outstand
ing facts in the Mexican situation
are:
Colonel Sibley's four cavalry
troops which entered Mexico
nearly two weeks ago in search
of the Glenn Springs and Bou
quillas bandit raiders, were back
at the border without casualties,
having penetrated 183 miles into
unknown torrid country over bad,
dusty roads. They rescued two
Americans held prisoners by the
bandits and brought back five
Mexican prisoners.
Marion Letcher, American con
sul at-Chihuahua City, was due
to arrive in Washington Tuesday
with a full report on , economic
conditions in northern Mexico, to
be made to the state department.
Officials understand these condi
tions are bad.
At Mexico City the Carranza
government was preparing anoth
er note to be dispatched to the

the face of discouragements
Many of the pure blooded ani
mals which they brought in were
from above the quarantine line,
and some of them died. Not
more than a dozen men in the
whole state dared to enter this
pioneer field, but now that they
have shown what can be done in
improving native cattle others
will follow. Purebred livestock
has come to stay. The scrub
steer will pass sooner or later.
Some work remains to be done,
however, to obtain widespread re
sults with herd improvement,
John M. Scott, animal industrial
ist to the University of Florida
Experiment Station, mentions
some of the most important: Do
not overstock the range but give
the grass a chance to become bet
ter established; provide dry for
age or ensilage to tide animals
through winter; buy good breed
ing stock to encourage men to
raise breeding animals; do not
mix blood or use grade or scrub
sires, and above all eradicate the
tick.
Florida Farmers Raise More Hav
Florida farmers are becomin?,'
more and more independent ol
imported hay. They are not only
raising more hay but they arc
holding it on their farms to feed.
The, last report of the United
States Bureau of Crop Estimates
gave the amount of hay on farms
at 15,000 tons, May 1. This is l;irt-;-r
by 4,000 tons than the amount
on hand at the same period for
several years. The tons on hand
May 1 for the last four years is
1915, 9,000; 1914, 11,000; 1913,
7,000; 1912, 7,000. Florida farm
ers fed about 80 percent, of the
1915 crop of hay.
C. C. Hare, field agent, for the
Bureau in Florida, calls attention
to the report for May. The per
centage of practically all crops
xcept strawberries are low. Held
peas are placed at 76 percent of a
normal crop'. All vegetables and
staple crops are below 75 percent
and some are 50 or below. Dry
weather is blamed for the poor
condition of these crops.
Remember the hundreds of tons
of hay that are imported into
Florida every year. It is time to
be thinking about hay crops.
There is a good demand for well
cured native hay.

Officials here suggested it might

for withdrawal . of American

30,000 Mexican Troops Sent North
The Carranza government has
ordered 30,000 troops into the re
gion south of the border to exter
minate bandits, according to in-.
formation reeeived at the state
department. The new troops
movements already are in pro
gress through Chihuahua, the de
partment's advices state. The
olumns are routed north via Sal-
tillo for the most part.
Prompt withdrawal of the sec
ond expedition when it reached
the end of the hot trail probably
will have a beneficial effect on
future negotiations with the ' de
facto government, officials be

Official reports said more than
3,354 Texas viational guardsmen
have been mustered into the fed
eral service. The total strength
of the Texas forces was 163 offi
cers and 2,644 enlisted men whom
it called out and additional men
have enlisted for the border pa
trol service..
Mustering of the Arizona and
New Mexico guardsmen is being;
delayed, General Funston report
ed, until the skeleton companies
can be recruited to the required
standard.
Secretary of War Baker has
not decided what action shall be
taken regarding the 116 Texas
guardsmen who declined to enroll
in the federal service. Judgo
Advocate-General Crowder has
submitted an opinion to General
Scott, chief of staff, outlining the
war department's authority to
court-martial the recalcitrants.
His only recommendation, how
ever, was that if the court-martial
were ordered a majority of
the members of each court be mi
litia officers, not regulars.
THE SEVEREST FIGHTING
IN AUSTRO-ITALIAN ZONE
Rome Claims Offensive Checked
The Battle About Verdun
Waged Vigorously .
London, England The severest
fighting just now is occuring in
the Austro-Italian zone, where the
Austrians have been steadily
making gains against the Italians
the past week. Vienna claims
that a total of 23,000 prisoners
have been taken from the Italians
and 172 cannon of all sorts, and
that the Italians who had advanc
ed toward Trent are rapidly be
ing driven back toward their own
territory and losing ground which
it took them months to gain.
Rome claims that the Austrians
offensive has been checked, that
the Italians have inflicted heavy
losses on the attacking armies
and have taken new ground at
some points.
The battle about Verdun rages
with unabated vigor. Tho French
have reoccupicd Fort Douaumont
with the exception of a small re
doubt in one corner which the
Germans retain. They repulsed
two German assaults on French
positions on Hill 304 during Mon
iay night.
To the. north of the French bat
tlefront, the British lost a trench
which the Germans claim reached
an extent of a mile and a quarter
to the Germans in bitter fighting
Monday afternoon in the Given-
chy neighborhood. British coun
ter-attacks in an effort to regain
the lost ground failed, according
to the German report.
vith the gradual subsidence of
muddy Condition of roads caused
by the spring rains, there is every
indication of the bitterest fighting1
and on the most colossal scale
since tho war began.
