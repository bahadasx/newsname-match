Tho following applicants for

mas took the examination on May
12th nn.l 13th : Misses Minnie
Tipton, Anita Wells, Bettio Prof
it!, Wanda Breeze, Inez Breeze,
Dexter Stephens, and Messrs.
Ezekiel Brnshear, William Mc
Cormick aud James Wireman, all
of whom made the required
grades nnd received diplomas
from the State Superintendent
inn County Board of Examiners.
According to the statement,
from Miss MilaKnox, who taught
tho school at Nada, the school
year 1915-10, the percentage of
average daily attendance, based
on census, was 7i, which will
entitle her to extra pay on ac
count of her having procured such
good attendance.
Tho State Supervisor of rural
schools said the greatest obstacle
to overcome was the idea of little
Bchools. Some want a little house
on a little ground, with a little
equipment and a little attend
ance from a little district haviug
littlo idas of education, little re
lations, history, traditions nnd

tleeducation, trniuing and expe-
at a little salary during a TmltT
annual term, teaches little chil
dren little things in a little way.
