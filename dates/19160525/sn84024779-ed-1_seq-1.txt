Everyone in the audience grasped
a more comprehensive idea of the
meaning of rural credits as com
monly used, as a result, of this ex
cellent address. Among other
things, Mr. Phalen urged a closer
personal connection between bank

iness.

Tomorrow the Little Twins base
hall artists will display their art
for they journey to Fergus Falls
to mix it up with the truck horses
of that place. Fergus from all re
ports has a fast team and they
have with them this year, Smith,
last year's catcher for the little
twins, and ihe local fans know
that, if Smithy has anything to do
with Ihe management Fergus
Falls will have a fast and hard
team to beat.
Sunday the two above mention
ed teams will get together and
battle for lirst. honors at Island
Park and I here should bo a large
crowd see (he boys start the local
season with an outside team. The
hoys here have not showed any
great hitting tendency to date,
but it it thought that their slump
was do to tile change in the back
ground, but all the hoys have good
records and there should be no
trouble in getting runs across the
plate and that is what counts.

from Haiti more and came to Far

him. The little twins secured him
from the Fargo management al

him. Ripperton at second is a reg
ular old battleship of superdread
nought proportions with a broad
side every time he conies up,
should deliver some telling shots
with the club and already this
season he has showed signs of
having a great season before him.
Wade at short and Scanlon on
third hail from Duluth and both
come here highly recommended
and both hoys show signs of be
ing more than able to earn llieic.
cats and sleeps.
Handschu in his first game with
the Science School showed that
lie is a receiver of no mean abil
ity and should l.e able to help the
club with his fighting spirit and
generalship.
In the pitching department Lef
ty Faust, the Pride of the Red, is
well known here and whatever we
could say is known beforehand.
Jones the new man is a young lad
with plenty of
smoke

prove a winner for the local team.
