MEETING TO BE HELD
IN ST. PAUL JUNE 14-15
Program of State Preparedness An-
nounced to Encourage
Homeseekers.
"Certain definite state-wide prob
lems for the handing of which the
people of Minnesota should combine,
will be taken up by the All-Minne
sota Development association at its
first annual meeting to be held at the
state capitol, St Paul, June 14 and
15," says F. W. Murphy of Wheaton,
president of the association, in issu
ing a ringing call for attendance at
the meeting. "Every industry, every
community, every citizen and home in
the state will directly or indirectly
feel the influence of the work of the
association," adds Mr Murphy
Many Possibilities.
The plan of the work mapped out
for the association, according to Mr.
Murphy, is one of immense possi
bilities He calls it a "program of
state preparedness" He says:
"Why should we not have a state
preparedness propaganda? Not a
program to repel invasion not one
to protect us against enemies not one
to guard our borders but one to
throw down the barriers between
town and country, to create a better
relationship betwen our citizens 'n
the various activities of their lives
one to encourage an invasion of our
state by homeseekers, farmers, mech
anics and by capital seeking profit
able investment.
Preparedness Program.
"Let us have a preparedness that
will:
"Place settlers upon the lands of
Northern Minnesota.
"Construct homes on the shores of
our beautiful lakes.
"Cause to blossom like the rose
the waste places in our state.
"Build up prosperous* commercial
centers
"Develop the great water powers
of the state, now of no value because
of neglect.
"Establish a state-wide, compre
hensive, sane system of drainage that
will multiply the productiveness of
the lands of this state now under
cultivation.
Better Citizenship.
"Enlighten our people to the point
where they will realize that smaller
farms and more careful and inten
sive cultivation mean more certain
returns, less dredgery, better living,
better homes and a finer citizenship
"Enlarge and promote that fine
philosophy of life which will give us
community spirit and community de
velopment in all that those terms
really signify.
"Give the boys and girls of the
open country and of the smaller cen
ters of population in Minnesota col
lege instruction in our high schools
Happier Homes.
"Develop our school system to that
point which shall give to our people
where they live and as they live those
finer things in life which shall mean
a better understanding of one an
other, a wider view of life, a keener
realization that the best place, the
place to establish happy homes, is
where our people live and not some
where else.
"Advance that fine interest in ag
riculture and the life of the open
country that is taking hold of the
people.
"Bring our leaders together from
all sections of the state and have
them march forward together as one
man in the creation of those better
conditions that we can and will have
so surely as we undertake to bring
them about.
To Check Move.
"Let us have a preparedness pro
gram for which we shall stand 'one
for all and all for one.' Let us do
that which be done to check the tend
ency of the people to move from the
open country to the centers of popu
lation.
"The division of our present farms
into smaller farms, the development
of our vacant lands, the intensifying
of the work on the farms of this
state means that we shall have to
have thousands and thousands of
fine young men and women to do
farm work. We shall have many of
these if we can interest people of
the rural districts in remaining
where they are.
Are Not Dreams.
"And these are not dreams. In
parts of Minnesota many of these
things have been realized. They are
all practical problems capable of solu-
tion.' But they are too big for indi
vidual effort, and they are calling

Peace reigns at the Bemidji high
school today.
After an all-day's battle which ex
tended to midnight a truce was ar

a conference between Delbert Woods,
president of the Senior class, Daniel
Gainey, president of the Junior class,
and school officials.

Yesterday was Senior class day and
at noon the Seniors floated a 1916
pennant from the roof of the high
school. Juniors climbed to the roof
of the school, confiscated the pennant
and floated a 1917 pennant from the
top of the school.
Later in the afternoon the Seniors
hung 1916 banners in the boys'
cloak rooms. The Juniors hung a
banner over the girls' cloak room
door.
A general free-for-all followed the

COAL REGISTER TO BE
OSED ON ENGINES
George Kerr, formerly of this
city, now of Brainerd, but with head
quarters here, is in possession of pat
ents on a coal register from the
United States, Russia, Canada, Eng
land, France and Germany.
While working as an engineer on
the Minnesota & International rail
road a year ago, Mr. Kerr saw the
practicability of such a machine. He
worked out a series of blueprints,
which he submitted to the various
countries for patents.
Several montJis*a officials f ilua.
road, upon learning of Mr. Kerr's in
vention became interested and under
their direction he was provided with
means to perfect his plans and given
a three months' vacation to work the
matter out and produce a model.
Mr. Kerr then changed his head
quarters from Brainerd to Bemidji
and has completed the model and
will test the mechanism on June 15.
The invention was made to make
it possible to ascertain just where and
how much coal was being used in the
various departments of the railroad.
The actual mechanism is composed
of a series of valves, two large iron
frames and a registration box. Com
pressed air works automatically on
the piston and valves which in turn
operate the register box, in which an
adding machine, clock works and a
register tape is confined.
The usefulness of the machine is
being recognized by a large number
of the railroad companies. It will al
so detect defects in various sorts of
railroad work.
As soon as the trial trip is made
and the practicability of the organ
ism is beyond a doubt, a stock com
pany will be formed.
Mr. Kerr will move his family to
this city a short time after the trial
trip is made in June.

WOMAN'SSTUDYCLUB
GIVESFAMOUSPICTURE
TO BEMIDJIHIGH SCHOOL
The Bemidji Woman's Study club
has given a beautiful picture to the
high school. The picture was placed
yesterday.
The subject of the picture is "The
Wisdom of the Law," painted by
Horatio Walker.
The object of the picture is educa
tional as well as decorative. Horatio
Walker is a contempory American
painter of unusual personal force and
of a remarkable persuasiveness.
These qualities are, the counterparts
of similar elements! in his character
as a man. He has? brought out the
heroic in pastoral and agricultural
life in many of his paintings.
"Spring Plowing" and "Plowing in
Arcadia" are familiar pictures. Two
vastly different works are "Gany
mede" and "The Boy of Winander,"
both of which are in Library of Con
gress, Washington, D. C.
The original of "The Wisdom of the
Law" is the center of a group of
three pictures in the Appelate Court
building in New York City.
In "The Wisdom of the Law"
there is a force that compels atten
tion and communicates its own
strength to one's self. There is the
large outlook found under various
guises in many of Walker's paint
ings. The technical skill is re
markable and comes from the artist's
penetrating earnestness. The unity
of the picture is complete and it has
a very noticeable vibration.
Wisdom in the center of the pic
ture has her hand raised as if about
to speak. She Is surrounded by sym
bolic figures, each one of which rep
resents an attribute of wisdom. These
are Learning, Experience, Love,
Faith, Humility, Patience, Inspiration
and Doubt.
