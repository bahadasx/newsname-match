They could not identify any of their

arrested as an accomplice. He de

STRONGER Til 01 -THEW ml
"BROTHER." :
The simple word rang out in tragic
j appeal, voicing the pent-up despair
of a lost soul. It was in blood-soaked
Belgium when one mornings
pale and anaemic sun reluctantly
Jaiged ifS faCj and frowned upon the
' iespoiled country-
prvui ma-
This time the word came from
i - r .l tXi J
the hps of the officer in Command
rr- .
of the firing squad who were there i
to do to death a man for an insigni
Meant infraction of the rules of un
h )ly war. j
1 he poor victim s voice had reach-,
ed the ear of the officer, which was
followed by a fraternal signal of dis
i tress and brought forth in reply this
! word, the symbol and the password
of all fraternities under the sun. It
means the same in all languages,
but for centuries until the advent
of the fraternal order was of the
tinking cymbal and the sounding
brass.
"RECOVER ARMS."
"PRESENT ARMS."
"SALUTE."
Every man of the firing squad
followed the commands and on each
of the faces, on the face of the of
ficer and on the ,face of the intend
ed victim shone the glorious sun
light of fraternalism which trans-
formed those men into gods. The
salute was to the "brotherhood of
.t I. T J" J .
i man. rvever aiu a more joyous
nor more buoyant-stepped detach
ment of soldiers leave an execution
ground.
The man was paroled and ex
changed. Sent to his home through
the 'spirit of fraternalism" which,
notwithstanding all the iron-clad
laws of a war machine, broke the
fetters and reached the hearts of
men.
This striking story had filtered
through the press censorship from
the bloody trenches and fields of
Belgium, and the men whd were ac
tors in this little drama will doubt
less go down in fraternal history.
Who can say but that fraternalism
will eventually triumph in this war
and bring men together as brothers,
'with the firm determination that
never again on God's green footstool
shall we or our posterity witness the
like of the war of 1914-1916? Ex. .

FAMILY CARES
This Information May Be of a Value
to Many a Mother in High Point
When there is added to the many
cares inseparable, from the rearing
of children that affliction of weak
ness of the kidneys and auxiliary
organs, the mother's lot is far from
a Uappy .one. This condition has
often been corrected by the use of
Doan's Kidney Pills. When relief
comes the mother's burden will be
lighter and her home happier.
Mrs. H. H. Culler, 600 S. Main St.,
High Point, says: "I was greatly
alarmed over the condition of a
y unger member of my family.
This one's kidneys were weak and
there was little or no control over
the kidney secretions, which caused
much annoyance. Nothing seemed
to do any good until Doan's Kidney
Pills were used. This medicine
made a cure promptly."

Sidney C Tapp, of Kansas City,
Mo , was in High Point recently.
He has been to Washington present
ing his idea with the Bible to the
Secretary of Wer, as a means of
Peace. He said: "This nation must
of course haye navies and armies
as long, as the lest of the' world is
armed. But tl ere is only one true
preparedness,' rndthat is to educate
therace .in the sex -psychology of
the Bible as Moses wrote it and
Jesus preached it. That within man
which makes him kill is within the
sex-nature and so is all evil. Moses
so wrote and Jesus so preached- The
Bible is a book of sex from Gene
sis to Revelation. Jesus overcame
the gexnature in mind and thought,
in the absolute, at thirty years of
age and became the Christ and the
Prince of Peace. What Jesus did
in the absolute t the race must be
taught to approximate, if the world :
is to have Peace and solve the pro
blems of the evils of the race. We
must get back to the .truth of the
Bible,!tbat all evil is within the sex-,
nature, if we would Christianize the
race. Mr. Tapp is a lawyer and has
written three books on the sex -psychology
of the Bible. "The Truth
about the Bible," "The Sexology of
the Bible,?' and "Why Jesus was
Man and Not a Woman " He is a
native of Orange county, N. C, and
was educated at Wake Forest Col
lege. - He has a neice, M.ss Irma
Tapp who is a teacher in the High
Point High School.
Mr. Tapp went to school with E.
D. Steele of this city. Me is practi
cally an invalid but has a wonderful
mind. He is thinking of locating in
Asheville. He left North Carolina
23 years ago lor the west on account
of his health.
The three books Mn Tapp wrote
will be offered for sale in this
week's Review and we aresrjfrethry
are well worth a place in'ffevery
library. He has evidently-struck
the right track. He receivred his
inspiration while a criminal -la wyer.
