COCA COLA CASE REVERSED
Supreme Court Snds Litigation Back
to Jury for Trial
Washington, May 21. The supreme
court toJay reversed the Tennessee
federal courts, which refused to con
fiscate, on petition of the government,
forty barrels of coca cola as violating
the pure food law and sent the case
back for presentation to a jury to
determine whether caffeine contained
in coca cola is injurious to health.
Justice Hughes, for the unanimous
court, held the Tennessee courts had
erred in deciding that no poisonous ar
ticles could be added to a proprietary
food, composed of ingredients brought
together within the meaning of the
pure food law, which declares to be
adulterated, any product with "added
poisonous or injurious ingredients."
Justice Hughes held the provisions
of the statute were somewhat incon
gruous, but that it was evident "ad
ded" meant '.artificially introduced."
The jury, the court held, should al
so pass on whether there is any coca
or any cola in the product.

KEEP GOILDREI
OFSTREETS
DANGER OF THEIR BEING HURT
BY PASSING AUTOS SUFFICIENT
REASON FOR THIS STEP AN
ACCIDENT LAST NIGHT.
Last night a young child, four years
of age, by the name of Archer, was
slightly injured by a passing automo
bile on South .Mill street, and but
for the presence of mind of the driv
er, Mrs. F. J. Ramsey, it might have
been more serious. As it was, the
child was slightly bruised about the
forehead, but otherwise escaped in
jury. Mrs. Ramsey took the boy to
the sanitarium for treatment, and this
morning lie was playing about the
house, apparently none the worse for
his experience.
The increasing number of automo
biles in this city should impel par
ents to keep their children off the
streets. Drivers, wilh few exceptions
in this city are as careful as can
he found anywhere, but when par
ents permit their children to run be
fure approaching automobiles, they
are incurring a risk that may termi
nate disastrously.
No driver wishes to injure a child
or grown person, but it is more often
the fault of the pedestrian than it is
of the driver when one is injured. If
peoplo paid more attention to the
crossings of the street intersections,
and refrained from "jay walking,"
there would be fewer injuries than
there are, at present. Mrs. Ramsey
stated this morning that she was go
ing at a very low rate of speed, other
wise the accident would have been
more serious and her statement is
corroborated by several eye witnesses
who state that the boy ran into the
car.
GOING AFTER SMALL
FACTORIES FOR ARDMORE
Provided that the right man can be
found to take .hold of the mechanical
part of a small factory, a thousand
dollars will be added by an outside
man who with his family will move to
Ardmore and push the business.
Secretary Gilbert of the Business
Men's Association held a conference
with the man in question yesterday
who came to take up with him the
Dee Hive industry plan. "This man"
says the secretary, "will add a thou
sand dollars to any amount which
might be put up here, and assume
charge of the business. He has rc
ct ntly' sold out some interests in
Tulsa and desires to throw in his lot
with Ardmore."
The plan of the secretary is for lo
cal capital to assist in the nature of
a loan a reasonable amount to start
small factories for the manufacture
of household necessities and such
goods as overalls, shirts, gloves,
brooms, etc. The Tulsa man is known
in this city and is a business man,
willing to 'back up his qualifications
with his money.
SLOW ABOUT RENDERING
TAXABLE PROPERTY.
Secretary West of the chamber of
commerce stated this morning that the
business men and property owners
along Main street were evidently sat
isfied that the taxes on their proper
ty was not excessive, and were will
ing to stand the added penalty for not
coming to the tax assessor's office and
rendering their property for taxation,
as that penalty will go into effect af
ter tomorrow, and the books of the
county assessor show that very few"
main street property owners have
taken the pains to come and render
their property according to law.
The farmers throughout the entire
country were prompt in this matter,
but the business men of this city have
been exceedingly slow to comply with
this order and the result will be af
ter tomorrow, a penalty will be added
for their failure to do so.
The last legislature changed the law
governing the county tax assessor,
and many fail to realize that they are
compelled to render their property at
th office instead of to the assessor
who formerly made a house to house
canvass.

CAPTURED N
CALIFORNIA
ALLEGED BURGLAR OF THE DOR
RAH JEWELRY STORE IS APPRE
HENDED BY OFFICERS. REQUI
SITION PAPERS FORWARDED.
Masquerading under nil assumed
name, Kirk Morgan, accused of break
ing into the jewelry store of J. V.
Donah here recently, was captured in
California and is being held by the
authorities pending requisition p ro
ceediiigs. It is alleged in the requi
sition prepared by t lie county attor
ney thai ho was going by the name
of David Boatly when arrested. The
allegation further states that a portion
of the jewelry was redeemed by the
offlicors of the city and county short
ly after the robbery was committed,
and that later some more of it was
returned by mail, with no name at
tached lo the package.
Sheriff Garrett went to work on the
case immediately, and having a hunch
that Morgan would make application
to join cither the a l iny or navy, got in
to communication witli the officers of
both branches of the service. Morgan
it is alleged enlisted at Houston, Tex.,
under the name of David Realty, and
was afterwards transferred to the na
val training staiion at Pan Francisco.
As soon as I lie authorities were ap
prised that ho was the man wanted,
they immediately wired Sheriff Gar
rett that they had him and advised
that rcipii.sil.ion proceedings be insli
tv.id at onje. Tin county attorney
has forwardi'd the papers to Governor
Williams and slated that ho was rea
sonably certain that Morgan would be
returned here to stand trial. In his
requisition petition the county attor
ney sets forth the allegations of sev
eral oilier affairs that young Morgan
has lee'i accused of, and requested
that the governor take prompt steps
for his return.
GREAT OFFENSIVE PLAN
TO TIRE FRANCE AND ITALY
Rome, May 24. The Austrian of
fensive on the Trentino front and the
furious efforts of the Germans to gain
a decision at Verdun are explained in
a scmil official statement published
here.
The central empires," says the
.statement, "wish to prevent, even at
the cost of enormous sacrifices, the
allies irom attaching mem simuriaiie- i
ously on all fronts.
"Germany and Austria aim at wear
ing out France and Italy, counting on
a continuation of tin temporary halt
in the Russian operations. They hope
that when Russia is ready at last to
resume the fight the other two nations
w ill bo so worn out as to need a rest."
The statement concludes with an
assertion that the AustroGerman
plans must fail, as all the allies will
be able to pass from the present de
fensive stage to decisive, simultaneous
action.
This great joint offensive, it Is de
clared, will bring about the down
fall of the Teutonic powers.
MILCH GOATS TO SOLVE
GERMANY'S MILK SHORTAGE
Berlin, May 24. In anticipation of a
probable shortage of milk next win
ter, the minister of agriculture already
is taking steps looking to the rearing
during the coming summer of as many
milch goats as possible. The agricul
tural chambers and organizations all
over Prussia are being urged to get
into touch with poat breeding associa
tions everywhere with the object of
influencing individuals in the right
direction.
Premiums for raising goats will In j
ail probability be offered, goat mar-
kets in the cities ot which goats are
so'd to butchers will not be held as
usual, and arrangements will be made
whereby special pastures will be avail-
able for the animals. The public will '
be urged to demand goat's milk as lit
t!e as possible, so that the summer's i
crop or kius may uc as large as
possible.
