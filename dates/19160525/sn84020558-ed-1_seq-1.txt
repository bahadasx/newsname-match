Robins, of Chicago, was selected as
temporary chairman of the national
convention of the progressive party
a: Chicago, at a meeting here today
of the executive committee of the
prugressivxe national committee.
qher officers elected were:
o. K. Davis, of New York, secre
tary, and F. I'. Corrick, of Nebraska,
sergeant at arms.
Mr. Robins, the choice for tempor
ary chairman, was the progressive
candidate for I'nited States senator in
Illinois in lilt. He was a coal
miner when the Klondike rush began.
He was one of the first to go to the
gold fields, and was successful in his
iiuest there. I'rior to 1!12. when he
joined the progressive ranks, he was
a democrat. Aside from naming tem
porary officers and a general discus-'
sion of organization, the greater part
of- the session of the committee,
which lasted most of the day, was
given over to making .plans for seat
ing delegates, alternates and guests
at the convention.
Those present at the meeting In
cluded Oeorge W. Perkins, chairman;
o. . K. Davis. secretary; Walter
.Brown. Ohio: Harold I.. Ickes, New
York; K. A. Van Valkenburg. Phila
delphia; William Childs, Brooklyn;
Raymond Robinson, Chicago; Everett
Colby, New Jersey, and Henry L.
Stoddard, New York. Absent mem
bers of the committee were repre
sented by proxies.
Reports indicated, it was said, that
the attendance of delegates and al
ternates would exceed jt, 000 instead of
1,265, as allotted in the official call.
This increase, according to Secre
tary Davis, is explained by the fact
that many of the states are sending
double delegations. This will not
affect their voting strength, how
ever, for the votes will be split.
Mr. Davis said the question of
nominating speeches and the names
of permanent officers was not dis
cussed today.
Progressive leaders said they expect
to send twenty-four carloads of
workers on two "convention specials"
leaving here Saturday afternoon. June
3. Other "convention specials," one
of which will consist of fourteen cars,
have been arranged for by the re
publicans to leave here Sunday after
noon, June 4.
It was announced today that both
contingents would be accompanied by
large delegations of women.

the village.
The fighting around Fort Douau
mont was furious, the Germans
launching attack after attack against
the fort, employing among others, two
fresh divisions of Bavarians. Several
times the attacks were put down witli
heavy losses, but finally the Germans
succeeded in re-occupying the point
of vantage which they had held virtu

In support of the plan it was urged

As an outgrowth of recent talk of

in the house of commons that the time

Fort Douaumont Retaken
PARIS, May 14. The Germans have
reoccupled Fort Douaumont. while the
French hold the immediate approach
to that position. This announcement is
made in the official communication is
sued by the French war office tonight
which says two new divisions of Ba
varians effected the recapture after a
series of furious attacks.
Driven to desperation by seeing so
much of its work undone, the German
command has hurled attack after at
tack against Fort Douaumont. At the
same time it has kept up its onslaught
on the left bank of the river to pre
vent the French transferring any
forces to the main scene of attack.
All day yesterday the tide of war
ebbed and flowed, inches being won
and lost at an appalling cost.
Again and again after reducing
trenches to a crumbling heap of ruins
by a deluge of shells the German in
fantry dashed forfard only to be
caught and swept away by a hurri
cane of curtain fire from the French
batteries and machine guns. When
night fell last night the positions on
both sides were unchanged.
A powerful offensive was under
taken by the Germans last night to the
east of Dead Man's hill on the Verdun

LONDON, May 14. In an im
promptu speech in the house of com
mons on the question of peace and tin'
propriety, of "employing the Ameri
can press as a platform," subjects un
expectly raised by Arthur Ponzenby,
liberal member for Stiring, Scotland,
in a strong address attacking the gov
ernment for allowing diplomatic eti
quette to stand in the way of possible
peace pour parlors. Sir Edward drey
the British foreign secretary set aside
all ideas that peace negotiations were
possible at the present stage and
plainly reiterated that the positions
of the allies in no way was changed.
Sir Edward declared that it was im
possible to consider terms of peace
without a previous agreement between
the entente allies: Further he ex
pressed the decided opinion that the
hostility had not yet reached a stage
where it was possible to talk of peace,
especially as the derman public was
constantly being "fed with lies" by
their ministers. ,
Mr. Ponzenby's reference to the use
of the American press as a platform"
was the outgrow tl of a recent inter
view with Sir Edward Grey. Sir Ed

that since German statesmen con
stantly svere giving interviews and
statements to the American press it
would be mere pedantry which would
hinder British statesmen from coun
tering these statements in the inter

DOUGLAB, Ariz., May 24. General
Bias Calles, commander in chief of
tiie de facto Mexican forces in Son
ora today appealed through Consul
tees G. Lelevier to Eliseo Arredondo,
ambassador designate of Mexico, to
request the state department to raise
portions or the war munitions em
bargo applying to implements used
alike for war and peaceful pursuits.
Since the embargo has been in ef
fect, not a bale of barbed wire, no
picks, shovels, or other tools which
could be classified as entrenching
implements have been allowed to
cross the border. As a result, BOROTa
ranchmen, farmers and miners are
suffering from a want of these very
necessary supplies, General Calles
represents.
In conclusion he says that he can
get all of the tools of that nature
he needs, if he desires to use them,
by commandeering them from the
mines and farms of the state. He
represents this attitude as pacific,
however.
General Calles also requests that
several thousand uniforms for his
army, held by customs officials here,
in Naco and Nogales, be allowed to
cross the border. Neither officers
nor men can renew their clothing and
as a result the army is becoming
quite ragged.

his new note had reached officials
here tonight, and while some appre
hension was apparent that its tenor
might not be entirely satisfactory-, the
general feeling was one of confidence
that it would open the way to a
definite agreement for continued co-
operation of American and de facto
forces in the pursuit of bandits in
noithern Mexico.
Recent reports from Special Agent
Rodgers at Mexico City have indi
cated a growing friendliness toward
the i'nited States and have led the
state department to hope the now
communication would suggest a re
sumption of negotiations for a proto
col covering the operations of tho
American expeditionary force.
Mr. Rodgers' dispatches have said
General Obregon's report of the con
feience on the border with General
Scott had made a strong impression
on officials of the de facto govern
ment and had convinced them that
the United States was acting in good
faith and had no ulterior motive in
U.. operations on Mexican sou.
Rumors that General Carran.a in
some form might renew his request
for withdrawal of the expedition
were given credence, however, by
some officials. Unofficial advices
have reflected a grave domestic situa
tion in Mexico due to labor and other
economic differences and to the meth
od of new revolutionary activities. It
has been suggested that under these
circumstances the de facto govern
ment might fear the consequences at
home of a recession from the demand
fo"" withdrawal. There are no indi
cations that a renewed demand for
withdrawal would meet with imme
diate acquiescence or lead to serious
consequences unless it were backed by
an order for hostilities against tho
American forces, This latter possibil
ity while it has been taken into con
sideration in all of General Funstons
military plans, is not regarded seri
ously. Officials were not disturbed
by border reports that the de facto
troops were moving northward in
force, taking it as a probable result
of the orders for cooperative opera
tion issued after the Scott-obregon
conference.
Tho state department's dispatches
today from Special Agent Rodgers in
dicated that the new note probably
was already on its way. He reported
that tho communication was coming
by special messenger and should be
in "Washington by Monday. He gave
no indication as to its contents. At

ficials professed ignorance as to the
note's character or the probable date

said:
"It is with pleasure that I report to

Funston's Request For More
Coast Artillery Is Denied
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 24.
General Funston's request for more
COBSt artillery , it is understood here,
has been refused by the war depart
ment. The additional units of the
regular army and the national guard
of three border states has enabled
him to strengthen materially the pa
trols along the border, but even with the
that added force there remain many
WOak points, it is said, and it was
to protect them that he asked fir
more companies of coast artillery.
General Funston refused to confirm
the report, but it was indicated at
his headquarters that he had replied
to tiie department's refusal by a re
quest that more guard troops be sent
to him.
The guard troops now in camp here
will start moving toward the border
tomorrow. The tirst regiment to go
will be tiie Second Texas, with head
quarter at Brownsville. This will
he followed by a regiment moving
Saturday to Eagle Pass and two days
later another regiment will enter the
Brownsville district.
Reports from General Pershing to
day indicated no sharindevelopments,
but reports from him and from other
sources reflected the activity of Mex
ican troops. In strong numbers the
Mexican forces were reported mov
ing to stations nearer the front, but
there was nothing to indicate that
motive was other than to estab
lish over northern Mexico an ef
fective police force. General Funston
and his staff have kept themselves
closely informed, how ever, of the I
Mexican movements.
Iate tonight it was stated at head
quarters that General Funston
originally asked the war department
for the national guards regiments of
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisi
ana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Later
the request was renewed and the guard
troops of three border states was or
dered. It is understood the request
still stands for the other troops. It is
considered possible they will be mo
bilized I.. serve on the border in lieu
of coast artillery,

that service is not now so rigorous
