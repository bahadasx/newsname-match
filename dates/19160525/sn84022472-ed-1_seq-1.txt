labor organizations of the city voted

President Wilson's Speech
At Charlotte Given
Much Attention.
WILL NOT STAND FOR
JOCKEYING BY ALLIES
Rumors of Mediation Cause
Sudden Drop in Berlin
War Stocks.
Berlin, May 25. A wireless despatch
from the United States giving the sub
stance of President Wilson's speech at
Charlotte, N. C, In which he alluded
to the possibility of American media
tion in the war is given the place of
honor in the morning papers. The af
ternoon editions return to the subject
-and their comments, together with the
wide interest shown by the German
public shows how important this news
Is regarded here.
Though definitely stated nowhere,
there is little doubt that Germany 13
wiling to consider a tender of good
offices to inaugurate peace negotia
tions. The former attitude in the high
est quarters that America had dis-.
qualified herself as a peace mediator
on account of her shipments of muni
tions to the allies has now changed.
If President Wilson, can hold out any
tangible possibilities that peace may
result through his mediation Germany
undoubtedly will be willing to con
sider such suggestions as he may - of
fer. .
This receptive attitude is naturally
subject to the condition that Germany
is not jockeyed into a position of an
nouncing her readiness to accept Pres
ident Wilson's good offices only to find
the allies later rejecting the tender
and asserting that Germany is suing
for "peace. i.
There is equally little' doubt that the
Eft-eat. masses of the people aside from
the professional hotspurs In the news
paper offices would willingly see Amer
ica in the Vole of peace intermediary,
despite the persisting bitterness over
the munitions question.
As a matter of fact fittle Is heard
nowadays, either tr4va the general
public or from the press,, on the sub
ject of American shipments of arms
President Wilson's declaration cannot
be said, however, to have, made a good
Impression on Germany as far as the
so-called "armor plate" newspapers,
the Tages Zeitung and the Taglisehe
Rundschau are concerned. . -; ... .
Other Chauvinist organs take ocea-
slon to assail President vWilson with'
bitter and uncomplimentary' phrases

impartiality of his- neutrality by mak
ing good his demand for 'respect fur-
American .rights against England. He
would then have an excellent chance.
says this papery -of succeeding' in his
peace mission, at least as far as Ger
many is concerned. ' -.
The rumors of mediation have af
fected the Berlin stock market. "War
babies" which have been, generally
weak, dropped lower .still; on reports
that,- America and other neutral coun
tries were contemplating a ' tender of
their good offices as peace mediators.
At the same time "peace stocks" such
as sniping and colonial securities, are
In strong demand.

Among the features of the day's
hearing was the testimony of Rev.

the local church, that salt was used
by the women with which to blind him '
in the parish house. '

Father Panik and that as a result of
the delay in getting word of the riot to

The defense set up was that a com
mittee of 20 persons had visited the
parish house with the intention of
asking the pastor to resign. That
they may have been prepared for
trouble arising from a refusal was
not made clear In the evidence. The
