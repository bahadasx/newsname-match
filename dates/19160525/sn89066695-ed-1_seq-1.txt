P. A. putj new joy
into the sport of
smoking !
VOU may live to
be llOand never
fed old enough to
vote, but it's certain-sure
you'll not
know the joy and
contentment of a
friendly old jimmy
nine or a hnnH rnlH
cigarette unless you get on talking-terms
with Prince Albert tobacco!
P. A. comes to you with a rral reason for all the
goodness and satisfaction it offers. It is made by
a patented process that removes fcfr ami parch!
You can smoke it krt and hard without a come
back! Pnrsce Albert has always been sold without
coupons or premiums. We prefer to give quality!
Prince Albert affords the keenest pipe and cigarette
flErrT?!ACC0 IiomIih-ss is as K.Kd as that sounds.' P. A. just
ansH-ers fie m versa demand for tobacco
witnout bite, parch or kick-back:
Introduction to Pnnce Albert tsn t any harder
than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A " You pay
out a little change, to be sure, but it s the cheer
fullest investment you ever made!
