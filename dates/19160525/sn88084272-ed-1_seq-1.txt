WASHINGTON, D. G, May 25.
Beversing his previous deci
sion, secretary of war Baker
anuounced today that the 116 members
of the Texas national guard who failed
to present themselves for muster into
lue federal service will be brought to
court martial immediately under the
EEHB kji s
eeed under its provisions.
Secretary Baker explained his action
by pointing out the difference in the
enlistment oaths the guardsman are re
quired to take under the Dick law and
under the new Hay-Chamberlain bilL
The Dick law requires an obligation to

Upon reeomneada&e Fiiige advo
cate general Crowder, the -eerfistary has
decided that the offence of the guards
men in refusing to present themselves
for master was committed under the
Dick law and trial should be held under
thai law.
Gen. Crowder. in a supplementary
opinion, held that the Hav-Chamberlain
act would not abolish the" offence with
which the Texans are charged, as has
been suggested. On this showing it will
not be necessary to issue a call for the
border militia after the Hay-Chamberlain
bill is signed.
Ho Call for More Militia.
It was stated officially at the war
department today that Gen. Funston bad
never requested that the Louisiana.
Arkansas and Oklahoma national guard
be called out for border service, as re
ported. Gen. Funston asked additional
roast artillery but the department de
cided it was not needed at present.

Defence,
jHW EAGER
TO TALK PEACE
I ons return to the subject and their
, comments, together with the wide In-
terest shown by the German public,
show how important this news is re
garded here.
Though definitely stated nowhere,
there is little doubt that Germany is
willing to consider a tender of good
offices to inaugurate peace negotia
tions. The former attitude in the
highest quarters that America had
disqualified herself as a peace media
tor on account of her shipments of
munitions to the allies has now
changed. If president Wilson can
hold out any tangible possibilities that
peace may result through his media
tion Germany will undoubtedly be
willing to consider such suggestions
as he may offer.
Little Heard About Munition.
This receptive attitude is naturally
subject to the condition that Germany
is not jockeyed into a position of an
nouncing her readiness to accept
president Wilson's good offer only to
find the allies later rejecting the ten
der and asserting that Germany Is su
ing for peace.
Little is heard nowadays, either
from the general public or from the
press on the subject of American
shipments of arms. The question
seemed to have been submerged by
other problems of existeBse "whicJl
are of immediate imporuafts to the
nation.

GERMAN WAR PRISONERS
SAY THEY ARE ABUSED
Berlin, Germany. May 25.) By wire
less to Sayville.) An account of the
treatment of German prisoners in
France said to have been obtained from
incapitated German soldiers who have
been sent home in exchange for French
prisoners is published today in the
Nbrddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitunp.
"All of them complain of abuse from
fanatical mobs and of the arbitrary be
havior of the commanders of the French
camps, who pay no apparent attention
to instructions," the newspaper say.
This may be due to the fact that the
French war minister does not exercise
sufficiently close supervision of the
prison camps.
"Virtually all the prisoners returned
in rags. In several cases It was pointed
out that clothing sent from home was
withheld from them."
AID WORLD'S INTERESTS,
NOT ONE GROUP WILSON
Washington, D. C. May 25. Presi
dent Wilson told callers today that the
Intervention of a neutral rn behair or
peace in Europe could rest only on a
mutual understanding by the belliger
ents that the terms to be arranged are
to conserve tne interests oi an. anu ml
the world at large, rather than those i
of a particular nation or group of na
tions among the warring powers.
Mr. Wilson did not disclose any defi
nite plan of action he may have formu
lated, nor authorize a formal statement
of his attitude. His callers gained an
impression, however, that the president
would entertain suggestions that he ex
tend his good offices to the belligei-
ents to bring about peace oniy wnen

Frenrh "Vot SIneh Concerned.
Military opinion here is not greatly
concerned over the result of the day's
fighting. Such Incidents are regarded
as inevitable in the strategy of action
and reaction upon which the stubborn
defence of Verdun is based. The aim
of the defenders Is to inflict the great
est possible loss upon the enemy at
the least possible cost to themselves.
French counter attacks are expected
to restore the' situation In favor of the
republic
Cunitere Rather Important.
The occupation of the village of Cu
mleres gives the Germans a slight ad
vantage. It commands the French lat
eral communications. However, the
village is so well covered by the French
artillery that the Germans will be un
able to profit to any great extent by
its possession.

More Stringent Regulations
Regarding Divorce Urged
By the Methodists.
Saratoga Springs. N. Y., May 25.
More stringent regulations regarding
the remarralge by a Methodist min
ister of divorced persons are provided
in a report submitted by the commit
tee on the state of the church at the
Methodist Episcopal church confer
ence today.
The church has never recognized
any cause for divorce except adultery
and has always forbidden remarriage
in any case where a divorced wife or
husband is living. By the proposed
change, a minister who performs such
a marriage Is guilty of maladministra
tion and Is to be held answerable to
his conference.
The total abstinance by Methodist
chureh members from the use of to
bacco Is urged in another report which
states:
"We record our solemn Judgment
that the habitual use of tobacco Is
a practice out of harmony with the
best Christian life."
Social Evil I Condemned.
Polygamy and the social evil are
condemned by the committee on tem
perance and public morals. The en
forcement of laws prohibiting the
former is urged.
Regarding the social evil, the com
mittee asserts that neither segrega
tion nor punishment by fines is a
remedy. The community should offi-
j daily expel and disperse vice, it con
times, and the state should provide
industrial settlements for the men
tally deficient and an honest olace in
society for those mentally capable.

Correctly Quoted In
Herald's Interview, He Says
Albaquerque, Xew Mexico, May SJJrd, IsiS.
Editor El Pas Herald:
Allow me to express to you my appreciation of the intervjeW published
iu your paper, which I gave 'to Mr. Guthrie Smith.
During the 20 years that I have been in pofitka, it has been my ex
perience to have been interviewed many times, and I wish to say to you
and would appreciate it if you wold convey the expression to Jar. Smith,
that it was the best and most satisfactory interview with me that I have
ever seen published.
Usually one is frightfully misquoted, and sometimes ?o much so that
one's position is stated on a matter of public concern as being the exact op
posite of what he intends it to be. Isaac Berth.
