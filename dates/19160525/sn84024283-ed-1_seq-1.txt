The fact brought out In!' Governor
Major's recent statement that there
was almost one million dollars in the
Interest fund in the State.treaaury and
several hundred thousand dollars in
bji.us ina r?ber spSl nda
which cannot be used, and -if these
were made available the State would
have an abundance in the general
- revenue, almost choked the Globe-
Democrat. It has grown black in the
face trying to explain away this show
ing of a full treasury, able to provide
for every necessity of the State by a
simple transfer of money from the sur
plus in special funds to the general
revenue, the only fund needing
enlargement.. The Governor's dec
laration that he intends calling
the attention of the next Legislature
to these simple remedies," which, if
carried out, will meet the demands
and needs of the "State, .incensed-the
Globe-Democrat and its allies in the
propaganda intended to make the
people believe the State finances are
in a hopeless tangle. In a few wordB,
"the Governor showed the utter falsity
of all the statements of the propagan
dists relative to State finances ami the
impossibility of their dire prophesies
concerning the same coming to pass.
Before this campaign is halt over the
G.-D., Pee Dee and their coadjutors
will be the most discredited bunch of
campaign saints ever discovered in the
history o political agitation.
Now that the kaiser and the better
elements of Germany have fully and
frankly acknowledged the Justice of
President Wilson's demands and the
German government specifically
promised to comply with them, the
critics of the administration's policy
and those howling that the neutrality
of our government is false, are left, in
a sorry predicament. They ought to
have decency enough to take their
copperhead principles and slink-away
into oblivion.
Republican politicians of St. Louis
representing the brewers have been
looking over the - Republican candi
dates for Governor. John Swanger
recently, submitted himself to them
for examination and approved.:, To
date no Democratic candidate has
presented , himself td the brewery
bunch for inspection. This arrogant
element is chlelly Republican, and
knows that the .Republican party is
the party of tender care for the
special privilege interests and in
different concern for the masses. '
A few facts from the record is worth
more than tons of hot air, campaign
stun. Here are a tew facts: The
present administration has paid $476,.
1 000 in bills coming over from the Had '
lev administration. List year it paid
6280.000 Confederate peusions, a new
obligation.: For this biennial period it

Will spend 1360,000 for road dragging.
This is also a new item, no former ad

for this purpose.- The farmers were

I was down in New Madrid county
last week. Stevenson & Fitz are do

On my way home I stopped at Iron-
dale and drove out to Belgrade and
Caledonia. It is fifteen miles west
from Irondale. This is a beautiful
oountry, fine farms, grand scenery,
and nice houses and barns' and all
have fine stocklon them. If there is a
country anywnere that shows the
handiwork ot Uoa it is tselleview. lne
merchants treated me fine and I shall
certainly go again. Caledonia is a
quiet little town and the merchants
are doing well.
I noticed two abandoned churches-
Mount Carmel and Liberty on the
road to Belgrade. This looks bad.
The old members are dead and the
young members have moved their
membership to the towns. There is
nothing I enjoy more than to attend
these old churches in the wild wood,
and hear the old preachers preach in
the old-fashioned way. I like the old
time religion; it is good enough for
me. ' 1 stayed all night at irondale
with Wiley and Lester O'Neal. Have
known these dear people ever since
their childhood. I enjoy talking with
them of bygone days. . . .
Well, next Sunday we want to dec
orate the graves of our dear ones in
our Des Arc cemetery. It is the dear
est spot on earth to me, for we have
dear ones there and soon we will join
them. Eev. W. Strothor will preach
at 11 o'clock and Hon. O. L. Mucger
will deliver an oration in the after

bat in keeping with the coltare and
social prestige manifest in the Valley.
Ia speaking of an appropriate loca
tion for the "Ironton High," we take
the liberty in suggesting the "Emer
son Grounds," tor truly, herein lies
an ideal site, as it embraces a spacious
park, embellished with grand old
forest trees, a lake (nature's beauti
ful sheen,) a mineral spring, which
was discovered by the chief of the
.Aborigines, who was the first explor
er of the "Mystio Ozarks." The
spring was later called the "Poquaw,"
In honor of the great Indian chief.
In addition to the Emerson Grounds
being associated with historical and
traditional Incidents, there is an im
posing statue of- Gen. U. S. Grant;
also olden artillery, etc, which lends
patriotism to this grand old park so
picturesque In its natural setting.
The palatial 1 residence on the
grounds could be utilized to a great
advantage, in the way of special class
rooms, a library, a recital hall, etc.,
and as previously men tioned.the loca
tion embraces a natural park, hence
the expense saved in this regard,
could be appropriated to the building
proper, thus giving prominence to
the "Ironton High," as suggested by
Mr. Louis Miller, an architectural
genius and the foremost promoter of
Arcadia. - Loma of the Ozarfs.
