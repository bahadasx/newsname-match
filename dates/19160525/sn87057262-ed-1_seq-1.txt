great fighting machines, brought a
lull in the titanic struggle around
Verdun early today.
The frightful slaughter around Fort

RECORD TIME BEING MADE
IN WAITE POISONING CASE
i*y-
Will Possi^l^ be Completed
.... and Justice Done, Before
Orpet Jury is Secured.
NEW YORK, May 2.—The struggle
to save Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
confessed poisoner of his father-in
law and mother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs.
John E. .Peck, Grand Rapids, Mic\,
£rom the blighting current of the elec
tric chair, started in court today with
the defense secrets practically sewed
•up in the minds of the defense attor
neys. Insanity will be its basis and
In that insanity the "man from Egypt"
•will figure, terhaps largely. The de
fense will probably seek to prove that
,the defendant's sinister shadow was
'"the real murderer and that in the
{hands of the shadow, the defendant
'was as helpless as a chUd.
If Dr. Waite is found guilty, it will
be because of bis entanglements with
Jtwo women and the suspicions of a
third. His wife, £is sweetheart and a
triend are the three who yesterday
gave their smashing testimony against
him.
It was Mrs. Clara Louise Peck
'Watte, his wife, who in firm voice
itold the Jury the things In the doctor's
Jife which indicated he had designs
/on the Peck fortune and of the things
^hich were indicative that he would
try for it by poison.
It was Elizabeth C. Hardwick, 24, a
•chool teacher whose suspicions were
aroused by the sudden taking off of
peck. Her suspicions ended in the
Bending of a telegram which started
Ithe investigation which has culmin
ated in the trial.
It was Mrs. Margaret Horton who
told the Jury that Dr. Waite trusted
Iher and confessed to her that he had
Xolsoned Peck. She told the jury:
That she had loved. Dr. Waite.
That once she would have given
pvery penny she could earn to save
Dim.
That Dr. Waite said to her after
the crime was discovered, but before
Jbls arrest, 'If I know you still love
*ne. I will make a fight for my life."
1
That after the doctor had been
locked up she begged for permission
to see him.
That her friendship with the doctor
/was "pure and platonic."
And then calmly and without
.tremor, betrayed him, saying he .had
.confessed to her the murder by
E. r*pk.
•.
With the prosecution rested at the
close of court yesterday. It establish
ed a record for a big murder trial.
The jury had been obtained in two
hours and fifty-four minutes.
The prosecutor had opened in a
speech taking less than half an hour.
The first witness was heard that day
and in the twelve hours of court time
Tuesday and Wednesday, the case
was completed.
Still dapper, faultlessly attired, and
his long wavy hair carefully brushed,
Waite took Ms place in the court
room again today, sitting only a few
paces in front of his aged father and
two brothers, Prank and Claude. It
was the first time Clyde Waite has
appeared at he trial. Opening for the
defense, Duell said:
The people of New York allege Dr.
Waite committed the atrocious crime
of oieonlng John B. Peck, March 12,
and at that time he was of sound
mind. You have sworn not to be
biased by the introduction of testi
mony as to mental unsoundness.
"If you find him mentally unsound
at the time of the crime, to find him
guilty would make you parties to a
Judicial murder—If I may use that
term.
"On the other hand, if you find him
of sound mind, a verdict of guilty
would be proper. Prom his father and
two brothers you shall hear the story
of his life. I shall show you his life
In as great detail as I can. Prom the
Hps of the defendant you shall hear
his own story that you may Judge for
yourself what manner of man he is.
"The defense will give testimony as
to all facts in connection with the
death of Peck, so that the jury will
have every particle of information we
have.
"You shall also hear from physi
cians their opinion of his mental
soundness.
Frank Waite was called as the first
witness.
The defense will not claim that
Waite is now insane, but through the
testimony of his relatives Beek to
show that he was of a peculiar na
ture and will then lead up to Waite's
story of the mysterious influence ol
the "man from Egypt."
Frank Waite began his story of Ar
thur a few months after the de
fendant's birth. Frank was then nin9
yean old.
"Three months after Arthur was
born." said Frank, "it was remarked

BERLIN, May 25.—The great Ger
man "nut cracker" is closing In upon
Verdun In the bloodiest fighting in all
history.
The right Jaw has advanced on a
front of three miles in the last sev
enty-two hours of the mad struggle
northwest of the fortress. The French
have evacuated the entire Dead Man's
hill position northwest of Verdun
after sacrificing more than a whole
army corps In a vain effort to hold
It. Hill 304, corner stone of the
French outer defense, west of the
Meuse, is now held Jointly by Ger
mans and French. Further eUght ad
vances for the Germans In the ra
vines on either eide will foroe its
surrender to the right wing of the
German army that occupied Cumleres
village Tuesday night.
The left Jaw of the crown prince's
great fighting machine bent back
slightly under the most terrific blows
struck by the French since the Ver
dun struggle began, has reconquered
entirely, positions temporarily sur
rendered to the French. It Is esti
mated here that 30,000 men died
fighting In dark underground caverns
and about the ruins of Fort Douau
mont In seventy-two hours without
changing the battle line in the
slightest
Authoritative denial was made here
today of French claims that General
Nlville's forces even temporarily re
occupled the ruins of Fort Douau
mont. In the most desperate hand to
hand struggle of the war a French
force did succeed In capturing a re
doubt and ruined works connected
with the fort. The only French de
tachment that penetrated the ruins
of the fort Itself, was completely
wiped out, not a single survivor es
caping.
Strewn about the southern and
western approaches to the ruined fort
are countless dead and wounded. Since
the French attack began Sunday night
the fury of the battle has not waned,
but has grown mere intense and there
has been no chanoe to reach the
dying.
West of the Meuse, the French are
being steadily driven back upon the
Verdun forts. The capture of Cumleres
opens the way for a German drive
down the Meuse upon Chattancourt
and Fort Bourrus.
The German center which drove the
French from the Dead Man's hill posi
tions, has not yet occupied all the
abandoned works because of the fact
that French artillery Is playing upon
the southern ridges.

MOVE FOE PEACE
WILL BE FOR ALL
If President Wilson Takes Action, it
Will Not be for Any One
Nation.
WASHINGTON, May 25.—When
President Wilson moves for peace in
the great European war he will not
act on behalf of any ope nation 6r
even one family of nations, but In be
half of all Europe.
This point of view, outlined by the
president to callers at the white house
today, may constitute the key note of
the address he will deliver before the
I.eague to Enforce Peace Saturday
night.
He discussed his views rather freely
today and indicated clearly that he is
basing his position upon a vast
amount of information received from
many sources bearing on the issue.
If the president feels there is any
thing that would forecast immediate
action for peace, he did not disclose
it. He said merely that when peace
comes, it. must be brouglit abont to
the benefit of no one nation, but for
the good of all.
The president today discussed with
Representative Hensley of Missouri, a
resolution providing for the calling
into conference of the Dations of the
•world for the purpose of preventing a
recurrence of the war. It is under
stood the president is favorable to
such a plan.
French scientists have decided that
carrier pigeons are influenced by

of wireless telegraphy, much less de
pendence can be placed on them.

and a survey of the influence exerted
by moving pictures were among the
topics for consideration of the feder

The president warned club women
not to support legislation unless it
was recommended by the federation
and pointed out the danger of club
women and their activities being ex

ODDS AGAINST PEACE.
[By Wilbur 8. Forrest, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
LONDON, May 25.—(Responding In
stantiy to Sir Edward Grey's declara
tion that peace is Idle until Germany
changes her attitude, Lloyd's today
made a radical shift In rates of In
surance against the war ending be
fore December 31.
A few days ago Lloyd's offered
even money that the war would not
end this year. Today the Insuranoe
brokers were willing to wager 3 to 1
that the war would not end In 1916.
Other odds posted by Lloyd's to
day were 7 to 8 that the war will not
end before April 1, 1917 20 to 1 that
the war will end before 1919J 4 to 1
that Sweden wHl not Join Germany

flect the strong feeling in English
circles that a German submarine
commander, by attacking a passen
ger liner without warning and caus
ing toes of lives, will upset the set

and embroil the two nations In war.
The newspaper*, today generally
applauded Sir Edward Grey'e answer
in commons yesterday to the German
chancellor's latest peace talk. The
consensus of .opinion among London
ers is that the foreign secretary has
killed all hope In Germany of a peace
on Germany's terms and at the same
time has alerved notice on Bethmann-
Hollweg that he mu6t make radical
changes in his peace program if he
hopes for an early ending of the

CASEMENT INDICTED.
LONDON, May 25.—'Sir Roger
Casement and Daniel Bailey, his_ sol
dier confederate, were today indicted
for high treason by a grand jury after
a brief consideration of evidence in
the preliminary hearing.
In charging the grand Jury, Lord
Chief Justice Baron Reading declar
ed that high treason was "the grav
fest crime against English law." He
directed careful consideration of the
testimony presented at the Bow
street police oourt hearing, connect
ing the two conspirators with the
Irish rebellion.
Casement will go to trial Jvne 26.
LLOYD GEORGE IN CHARGE.
LONDON, May 25.—David Lloyd
George, minister of munitions, has
been given full charge of the Irish
situation. Premier Asquith announced
in commons this afternoon.
Lloyd George was the unanimous
choice of the cabinet, the prime min
ister announced. He will devote his
time and powers in an effort to ef
fect a settlement between the con
flicting elements In Ireland.
The prime minister appealed to all
sections of the house to refrain from
discussing the Irish question while
Lloyd George conducts negotiations.
John Redmond, replying for the Irish
party, said that If the plan failed, the
fault would not lie with his party.
Lloyd George's selection was a sur
prise to commons. In the lobbies of
the houee of commons it was pointed
out that the appointment of the
Welsh leader was an indication that
England's munition problems have
been settled for the time being at

tary of War Baker today announced
he will direct the calling of a court
martial to try the cases of 116 Texas
militia men charged with failing to
present themselves for duty on the
border.
This reversal was due to the dis
covery of new legal points which the
Chamberlain army bill would not
obviate as was held yesterday. The
oath required of Texas militia men
is that they shall defend and obey
Texas government.
In these circumstances Judge Ad
vocate General Crowder believes the
new military bill does not render the
militia law void and that the offense
of failure to present themselves for
muster is not wiped out. For this
reason. Baker decided upon the oourt

that the coast artillery branch felt it

The request for the coast artillery

General Funston today changed his
