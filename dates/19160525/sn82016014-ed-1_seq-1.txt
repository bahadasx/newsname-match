Ira McGhee, 50 Years Old, in
Attack on Girl of Eleven 1
Sheriff Tells Story After Bring
ing Prisoner to Topeka.
ACT AROUSED ALL 0SKAL00SA
Jefferson Co. Officials Feared
Mob in Home Town.
McGhee Told Shawnee Sheriff
He Was Ready to Plead Guilt,
That Ira McGhee made a complete
confession to the effect that he at
tempted an assault yesterday upon the
11 year old daughter of Archie Lar
kins, clerk of the district court of
Jefferson county, was the statement
made by Sheriff E. W. O'Brien over the
telephone this afternoon.
"He made a complete confession to
the county attorney and myself in the
presence of two witnesses," said
O'Brien. "The confession was not re
duced to writing but enough persons
heard it to make it stick."
Rushed to Topeka.
Following this confession McGhee,
a man forty-five or fifty years of age,
was rushed to Topeka in an automo
bile by Sheriff O'Brien to protect him
fmm mnh virJence. They reached to
peka during the night and McGhee
was placed in the county jail where he
will be left until it is safe to take him
Vianlr trt OskalOOSa.
There isn't anv Question about the
facts in the case," continued Sheriff
O'Brien. "McGhee took tne gin wim
him on a ride to the country. He
Rtnoned at a farm house and knocked
at the door. No one answered and he
tried all the doors. The woman of the
house was upstairs but did not want to
open the door. McGhee thought there
was no one at 'home and he returned
to the automobile and attempted to
assault the girl. The woman upstairs
looked right down upon them and saw
everything that was done.
Shouted to Him.
"She shouted down to him and told
him to let the little girl alone. He
left the girl and started towards the
house after the woman. She called
the sheriffs office and McGhee
started away with the girl in the ma
chine. The girl was left at a farm
house farther on and was picked up
bv us and brought back to town. Mc
Ghee eluded the pursuers and by the
time they reached Oskaloosa he was
already here.
Mob Fear at Oskaloosa.
Sheriff O'Brien stated that feeling
against McGhee was running high at
Oskaloosa last night and that it would
have been unsafe to have kept him in
the Jefferson county jail. He also
stated that he would not come to To
peka to get his prisoner until some
time next week.
"It wouldn't be safe to bring him
back now, he said.
Girl Is Uninjured.
That the little Larkins girl is un
injured was a statement made by Sher
iff O'Brien over the telephone.
"I said in Topeka last night that
she was uninjured," he said, "and that
statement stands. She was badly
frightened when we brought her to
town but an examination shows that
McGhee did not injure her in any
way."
McGhee. at the county jail, was not
in a talkative mood this morning, but
he denied having made a confession.
Calls It a Mistake.
"There isn't anything I want to say,"
he said, "except that a mistake has
been made."
"Are you guilty of the crime?" was
asked.
"Of course not," he said, "but I don't
want to talk now."
"Who is this woman that makes the
charge?" was asked.
"Her name is Wagner," he replied.
"I have known her since long before
she was married."
"Is there any reason why she should
bring a charge of this kind without
foundation ?"
"Not that I know of," said McGhee.
"I don't know what she can mean. She
says she saw things that never hap
pened. This is awful. I never was
arrested before in my life. I never
sued anyone and never was sued. Why,
I have had that little girl with me on
rides lots of times. I know her father
well and we have always been friendly.
All of the children in the family are
friends of mine. I have no family,
except my mother, and ahve always
devoted considerable time to this fam
ily of children."
McGee has lived in Jefferson county
for many years and has borne a good
reputation.
"I don't see how people who have
known me for years up there could
believe anything like this," said Mc-
Ghee.

Defense to Show Strong Pre
sumption of Suicide.
Waukegan, May 25. Counsel for
Will H. Orpet, the University of Wis
consin student who is on trial here
under a charge of murdering Marian
Lambert, his sweetheart, announced
today that the parents of the dead girl
had been subpoenaed in the case.
They are expected to testify regarding
the girl's mental condition just before
her death when it has been asserted,
she was despondent and consulted
with her parents about her trouble.
The action indicated that the defense
would attempt to show a strong pre
sumption of suicide. Within a half
hour after court had convened today
three Jurymen had been accepted by
the state and tendered to the defense.
Declarations by business and profes
sional men of Waukegan and Lake
Forest members of the sixth venire
that they had formed opinion in the
case seeking thereby to be excused,
brought a sharp rebuke from Judge
Donnelly, who is sitting in the case.
"It is not an evidence of a high
order of citizenship to seek to evade
jury service in this case," he said.

CITY HALL IS
CLOUDED WITH
INTERNAL ROW
Mayor House Suggests Probe
of Water Department.
Action as an Offset of Inyesti
gation of Corporations.
WASSON RESOLUTION SENT IN
Commission Asks $5,000 to De
fray Cost of City Audit.
Other Developments May Fol
; low House Suggestions.
Mayor House cast a monkey wrench
into the proceedings of the city com
missioners at this morning's meeting.
After a resolution, introduced by Com
missioner W ass on had been read, ask
ing that $5,000 be set aaide to employ
expert accountants to investigate the
books of the Topeka railway and the
Topeka Edison company, he suggest
ed "that if an investigation was to be
made, the city water department be
included in the investigation."
It was a bolt from a clear eky and
as none of the commissioners was
ready to express an opinion, no action
was taken on- the mayor's suggestion
at the meeting. -1
After the first reading of the reso
lution the mayor said: "I do not be
lieve that any good will come of this
investigation, for I do not believe the
city will receive any money as a re
sult of it nor have I believed so for
some time."
It will be remembered that Commis
sioner Newland voted against . the
street car company, a few days ago,
in the Jitney fight.
"Were you notified in advance that
the mayor was to make such a sug
gestion," Newland was asked after
the meeting.
I never received such notice from
any one. It was a complete surprise
to me but I have no objection to the
investigation," he said.
The interests that own both
the street railway and the Edison
company are opposed to a municipal
owned water plant.
It is predicted around the city -hall,
that a row will follow if the- mayor-attempts
to inject any issue that will in
any manner becloud the investigation
which was set on foot this morning by
the Wasson resolution.
No action will be taken on the Was

resolution reads:

On Mexican Border They Rec

Sand Hills Ring for Colonel,
Says C. L. Mitchell, Topeka.
THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS
Driven Out of Mexico Becanse
of Lack of . Protection.
They Are ?Tot "Too Proud to
Fight" in Three States.
Down on the border, where mothers
are grieving over lost sons, where j
heads of the households are financial
wrecks, where fathers and sons are
patrolling the hot, unhealthy sand
hills, in military and often in citizens'
clothing where the terrible price of
unpreparedness and vacillating ad
ministration policies has been brought
home, there is only one cry Theodore
Roosevelt for president. That was the
message brought to Topeka today by
Charles L.' Mitchell of Crane & Co.,
after a seven weeks business trip in
New Mexico and Arizona.
There on the border with thousands
of homeless refugees invading the
towns, with fresh graves dug, with
homes broken lip by a call for militia
mobilization of three states and with
night and day haunted with fear of a
second Columbus massacre, the well
constructed phrases of "watchful
waiting" and a country "too proud to
fight" have been found to be empty.
People in that country realize the
truth of the homely, direct phrase
ology of Theodore Roosevelt put into
practice, to be the only salvation for
themselves and for the country at
large.
Democrats Turn to G. O. P.
"Even the old, dyed-in-the-wool
Democrats called for Republican bal
lots at the primaries, said Mr.
Mitcrell today.
Mr. Mitchell described the deplor

He told of the young men dragged
from lucrative positions by the mobi-
lizaticn call, to spend the next year
or more in patrolling a border of sand
hills, all as a result of a small stand
ing army. He described the scenes
in small towns 20 and 30 miles this
side of the border, where each night
finds a portion of the male popula

PROBE A1JEL0IT
Governor - Capper.. . Appoints
Girls' School Investigators.
Three Women Will Look Into
Charges Against Officer.
BEATEN WITH RUBBER HOSE?
Claims That Girls Were Subject
to Extreme Cruelty.
Mrs. Mitchner, Topeka; Miss
Scott, Baldwin ; Mrs. Hoffman.
Following the report of a committee
which Investigates charges against
the state Industrial school for boys.
Governor Capper announced today
that a committee composed of three
well known Kansas women would in
vestigate conditions at the state in
dustrial school - for girls at Beloit.
The committee is composed of Mrs.
Lillian Mitchner, Topeka; Miss Lillian
Scott, Baldwin, and Mrs. Catherine A.
Hoffman, Enterprise.
The appointment of an investigat
ing committee for the girls' school
follows the making of sensational
charges against the management of
the school. Miss Frankie Wilson is
superintendent. Recently it was
charged that an inmate of the school
was beaten with a piece of rubber
hose until there were scars on her
back as a result of her treatment.
It was also charged that girls were
placed in straight jackets and that
the gag was frequently used. Other
charges, it is claimed, have also been
filed.
"As the result of the complaints
and charges that have been made.
both the board of corrections and the
superintendent have asked for an in
vestigation," said Governor Capper.
"I did not wish to appoint a commit
tee, however, until the Investigation at
the boys' industrial school had been
disposed of. Because the school is
for girls and under the management
of a woman, I appointed three
women to do the work."
Mrs. Mitchner is president of the
State Women's Christian Temperance
union. Miss Scott was formerly
president of the State Teachers' as
sociation, while Mrs. Hoffman is sec
retary of the State Federation of
Women's clubs.

German Smashes Recover

HISTORY'S BLOODIEST FIGHT
French Evacuate Dead Man
Hill Before Invaders. ;
Detachment Holding Advance
Position Is Decimated.
Berlin, May 25. The . gigantic
German "nut cracker" is closing In
upon Verdun in the bloodiest fight In
all history.
The right jaw has advanced on a
front of three miles in the last 72
hours in the great struggle northwest
of the fortress. The French have
evacuated the entire Deadman HiH
position northwest of Verdun after
sacrificing more than a whole army
corps in vain efforts to hold it.
Hill 804, corner stone of the French
outer defense west of the Meuse, la
now held Jointly by Germans and
French. Further slight advances faf
Germans in the ravines on either side
will force its surrender to the right
wing of the German army, which
occupied Cumieres village Tuesday
night.
The left jaw of the crown prince's
great fighting machine bent back
slightly under the most terrific blows ,
delivered by the French since the
Verdun straggle began, has recon
quered entirely positions temporarily
surrendered to the French. It is esti
mated here that 30,000 men died
fighting in dark underground caverns
and about the ruins of Fort Donau
mont In 72 hours of battle without
Changing- the- - battle line in the
slightest.
Authoritative denial was made here
today of French claims that General
NeiviUe's forces even temporarily re
occu pied the ruins- of-Fort Douaa
mont. In the most desperate hand-to-hand
struggle In the war a force did
succeed in capturing a redoubt and
ruined work connected with the fort.'
The only French detachment that
penetrated the ruins of the fort it
self was completely wipd out, not
a single survivor escaping.
Cant Rescue Wounded.
Strewn about the - southern and
western approaches to the ruined fort
are countless dead and wounded.
Since the French attack began Sun
day night the fury of the battle has
not waned, but has gitiwu more tense
and there has been no chance to reach '
the dying.
West of the Meuse the French are
being steadily driven back upon the
Verdun forts. The capture of
Cirmeires opens the way for a Ger
man drive down the Meuse upon
', Chattancourt and Fort Burrous. -
The German center, which drove
the French from the Deadman Hill
positions has not yet occupied all the
abandoned works because of the fact
that French artillery is playing upon
the southern ridges.
All day attacks by the French In
the Caillette Wood southeast of Fort
Douaumont, in which the French mat
with severe losses were beaten off by
the Germans, who report the capture
of more than S50 prisoners and 14
machine guns.
I Alii of Exhaustion. "-
London, May 25. Utter exhaustion
of the - human elements in the two
great righting machines brought a lull
in the struggle around Verdun early
today.
The frightful daughter around Fort
Douaumont came to a halt last night
with the fort again in German hands.
During the night the French made n
effort to wrest the position from the
hands of the conquering Bavarians;
Violent fightirur occurred south and
southwest of the fortress late yester
day in which Berlin claims the cap-'
ture of French positions in the Haudo
mont quarry and near Curoierea vil
lage, where the French announce an
advance. However, on Hill 304 and
immediately before Fort Douaumont,
the armies rested in thier trenchea
throughout the night. There was no
let up, however, in the tremendous
struggle between German and French
artillery. On both banks of the Meuse
the cannonading was of terrific pro
portions.
Still on Austrian Soil.
Rome, May 25. The official bul
letin issued last night by the war de
partment indicates further defense
lines have been taken up by the Ital
ians, who are still on Austrian terri
tory in the Lagarina valley, where tha
attempts of the Austrains to recapture
the village of Marco, about 15 milea
south of Rovereto have failed.
In the Area valley, on the direct
route to Vicenza, the Austrian and
Italians are fighting on the frontier
