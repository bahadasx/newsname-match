urday from his visit in Oklaho
ma. He says the spring has

John Gloss, who lives north of

worms-

come to Estancia often, was here
Tuesday. He lives west of Mc

raised some beans the "dry
year" and he sold some of those
beans resently. He is planting
45 acres of beans this year. He
intended farming some on the

through April he could not get
the land ready.
I. M. Bolton, whose place is in
the foothills west of Estancia,

cutworms have done little dam
age on his place. Speaking
about the depth to which mois
ture has penetrated the ground
this spring, in digging for a cave
on a hill side where the surface
was sod, Mr. Bolton found the
moisture had penetrated a little
more than six feet.

county, Kansas. Butler county
has developed into an oil country
since the Milbourns left there,
and some of the land formerly
owned by Mr. Milbourn has
made its present owner Wealthy.
Mr. Milbourn made it a par
ticular point to inquire of men
who had had experience with
the silo, and those best posted
agreed in saying that the silo is
the thing. Some trouble and
luss has occurred with above
ground silos from freezing and
thawing, which has spoiled more
or less of the contents at the
outer edge.
ine Memorial Day exercises
will be held at eleven o'clock
next Sunday at the Baptist
church instead of at the Methodist
church as was announced last
week.
W. T. Guinn arrived several
days ago with a drilling outfit
and stuff for J. C. Montgomery
in a car. Mr. Guinn intends to
drill some wells for Montgomery
and Dennis on their leases on the
north line of the county.
The Valley Auto Company has
recently sold cars as follows: To
Clem Schaffer of Mountainair
and Christino Chaves of Willard

all sold out, however, and a few
prospects are still in sight.
There is every indication that
crops planted on land that has
not been farmed for several
years are in danger of serious
damage by cutworms. All re
ports agree that land well culti
vated last year, or plowed dur
ing the fall and winter is prac
tically free of cutworms, while
the land that has been unculti
vated is swarminsr with them
O. R. Pollard is farming some of
the latter kind. He is planting
about thirty-five acres. On
about half of this the thistles
were cut and put up for feed last
year, and this part of the land
apparently has not a great many
cutworms, but where the thistles
were permitted to grow, it is
literally alive with them. Mr.
Pollard has moved a flock of
chickens onto this land, and the
fowls are doing a good business,
but he doesn't expect them to be
able to clean up the worms.
There are too many. Mr. Pol
lard hopes, however, that most
of the cutworms will be gone
before hia crops are up.
A subscriber has handed us
newspaper clippings as follows:
"Little John Gasman who has
been sick the past two weeks is
not much improved at this writ
ing. Dr. Gibbs of Wagon Mound
and Dr. McClanahan of E. Las
Vegas have been in his attend
ance and a nurse was called Sun
day." "Mr. Cook Addison Ely and
Mrs. Carrie Ralston ;. Wasman
were quietly married at the home
of the bride on Friday evening,
March 31st, by the Rev. N. H.
Huffman of Wagon Mound. Mrs.
Robt. Sims and C. J. Brink stood
up with the bride and groom and
besides theie two no one else had
even an in'.ling of what was hap
pening."
Presumably this is from a
Wagon Mound, New Mexico, pa
per. Mrs. Wasman formerly
lived west of Estancia.

Herman Herrin came in from
Oklahoma last week. He is stop

Mrs. G. W. Austin writes from
Canyon, Texas, that she is im

She seems to be" feasting both
mind and body on fish and fish

tell Mr. Austin that it is not the
altitude that is causing her im

plenty to eat. He admits that
eating is really a prominent fac
