(Copyright, 1916, by W. Q. Chapman.)
Five years had passed since Allison
took the count in the ring, conscious,
through a whirling fog, of the Jeering
face of Bent above him. During those
five years Allison hrl passed from
twenty-seven to thirty-two, from afflu
ence to poverty. He had supported
himself by fistic encounters with sec
ond-raters, with third-raters; he had
coached cheap clubs, and he lived
with his wife and baby in a tenement.
Allison bad never known how it hap
pened. Five minutes before be was
the champion of the world In his class,
unsurpassed, netting twelve to fifteen
thousand a year. He and his young
wife, Molly, whom he adored, lived
royally. Molly, who came from a high
er stratum of social life, deprecated,
indeed, her husband's prize-fighting
friends, but her gentle nature was In
capable of resentment, and when
money comes in freely somehow one
does not care.
Then Bent, who bad never made
any special showing, had challenged
him. There was enmity between the
men. Allison had been winning in his
usual style until Bent got In that solar
plexus blow. After that things began
to go badly for Allison, and a terrific
right and left put him to sleep. When
he awoke the fight was over.
He tried to come back, but they
never come back. Bent walloped him
again, and then others took a band.
Allison went down and down. His
muscles were as taut, but his nerve
was gone.
The five years that followed were a
nightmare.
"Give up the game, Joe/’ pleaded
Molly. “The baby's growing up; she’s
beginning to understand things. 1
want her to be proud of her father.”
The memory of the wasted money
haunted Allison. With five thousand
dollars now they could have that little
Some of the Blows Told. Some Failed.
farm far away. Nobody remembered
Allison, for memory Is short In the
ring; he had just disappeared, and
even bis name only awakened a half
forgetful recognition.
And Joe could do nothing but box
and teach boxing. He bad never
learned a trade. Since chance threw
him, as a little boy, into the company
of prize fighters, he bad followed the
ring. And he knew, worst of all, that
he was just as strong, Just as quick
as be bad ever been. Even at thirty
two he knew that, given his nerve
again, he could beat Bent, the arrogant
champion, who went up and down the
country, offering - standing prize of
a thousand dollars to anyone who
could stand up against him for six
rounds, and five thousand for anyone
who could win ten rounds on points.
“If only you could get your nerve
back, Joe,” said Molly.
“For one fight,” answered Joe grim
ly. “Just to win that five thousand
and make a home for you and Dolly.”
“But the moment you try you know
you lose your nerve, Joe, dear. Every
newspaper said Franks really won on
points in that last match with you.
And yet you could have knocked
Franks out In one round If —■'
"If I could get my nerve!” sighed
Joe.
But he would not give up bis hopes.
The sight of the baby spurred him on.
Bent was coming to town in three
months’ time. Could he fight Bent
and win the thousand. Could he
stand up six rounds with the sight of
that Jeering face above him as he
leaned, battered, against the ropes?”
And Joe prayed, and In bis heart he
registered a determination, which he
did not confide to Molly.
“Joe, you’re never going to grow a
mustache!” she exclaimed, as her hue- {
band's face became more and more
bristly.
“You watch me, Molly!” he told her.
And a few days later, unable to con
tain himself any longer, Joe told her.
Molly wrinkled her brows thought
fully. “You know, It wouldn’t be
splendid," she said. “But they 11 know i
you, even with your mustache."
“No," answered Joe. “Five years
means all new faces In the ring. Alt
Johnson, the manager, Is a new man;
I never saw him.’
“And you think you can really

, stand up against Bent for six rounds
and win that thousand?”
The dream of the five thousand
1 stirred secretly in Joe’s heart, but,
like a practical man, be had put It
away. “If Bent doesn’t recognize me, ’
be replied.
He put the thought of Bent’s face
out of his mind too, and set to work
training. Joe had never got much out
of condition, but be lost a lot of fat
and put on a lot of muscle during the
next months. Everybody remarked
that Joe was easier In the ring,
handler, tco. His mustache was the
subject of some banter. Perhaps Joe
had been premature, but he knew that
the cheap club which he coached was
not likely to be represented at the
Bent show except as individual spec
tators.
It was a breathless evening for Mol
ly, and she clenched her hands in fury
as Bent stepped into the ring.
“One thousand dollars for any gent
that can stand up (or six rounds,” an
nounced Alf Jackson. “Five thou
sand for a win on points.”
The local champion came into the
ring. He squared up to Bent, who
grinned and mocked him. The cham
pion’s blows fell like thistledown
upon Bent’s body. With a few seconds
to spare Bent put all his force into a
righthander. The local champion
dropped like a log. The manager and
bis friends carried out the iimp body.
.‘‘Mr. Joseph Soually!” announced
the manager.
And Molly saw Joe step Into the
ring. She watched Bent’s face, hold
ing her breath with apprehension.
But Bent did not know Joe. Ho
played with him, not knowing that
Joe was playing, in his turn. Pres
ently the champion's fist shot forward.
Joe turned his bead and the force fell
upon air. And as Bent lurched and
swayed Joe’s fist went bard into bis
mout.i. Bent went to the ground.
A roar went up from the spectators
as Dent at his seconds’ knees, grim
ly wiped away the blood from his cut
lip. Everybody was looking at Joe,
who was cool as a cucumber. Molly
was prouder of him than she had ever
been. This was moral, not physical,
strength, the kind any woman might
be proud of. The second round be
gan. Bent came forward like a tiger
and rained blow upon blow against
Joe’s face and body. Some of the
blows told, some failed. The end of
the second round bad certainly been
Bent’s.
In the third round Bent seemed to
realize that he was up against some
thing tough. He looked uncertainly
Into Joe’s face. Joe played with him
as Bent had played—played until ho
saw the sudden light of recognition In
Bent’s eyes, saw the sneer which he
had dreaded about his mouth.
And In place of the anticipated fear
Joe felt a wild exultation. He saw
that the other’s nerve was gone. Ho
leaped at Bent. His own blows drove
the champion round the ring. Shrieks
of delight went up all round the circle,
men stood up and waved their hats
and yelled themselves hoarse. Time
was approaching. Joe had been wait
ing for that. As Bent turned at bay
and tried his famous punch Joe gave
him his. with every ounce of hla
strength. Bent dropped senseless.
“Time!" yelled Alf Jackson.
But “time” for Bent meant three
quarters of an hour before the flicker
of an eyelash betrayed the return of
consciousness. And Joe was hoisted
on the shoulders of the crowd, which
had recognized him.
"Bravo. Joe! You came back, Joe!”
they yelled.
But Molly knew that Joe had come
back to her —and to their child —In
another sense than that.
IS THE MOST USED LIBRARY
Daily Average Attendance at New
York’s Institution Beats World’s
Record.
Close after the discovery that New
York Is the greatest city in the world
comes the report that Its public library
is the most used library on earth, re
marks an exchange. Its dally aver
age number of readers Is double that
of the British museum of London or
the Blbliotheque Natlonale of Paris,
according to the report for 1915, Just
published, which says that 10,384,579
books were borrowed In the year and
that 2,558,717 persons entered the cen
tral building at Fifth avenue and For
ty-second street. The war has brought
a great Increase In the number of
people who use’ the library for re
search. It has become, the director
■ays, an immense laboratory for scien
tific Investigation, particularly those
seeking information regarding new in
dustries.
While He Waited.
An excited-looking man burst Into
the doctor’s surgery, where several pa
tients were waiting.
“I say, doctor,” he began hurriedly,
“I—’’
“Pardon me, sir,” said the doctor
coldly. “It Is no* your turn.”
"But —”
“You must wait,” said the man of
medicine coldly as he conducted an
other patient Into his consulting room.
The caller took a seat near the win
dow and waited for 30 minutes with
obvious impatience. Then the doctor,
having dismissed all his waiting pa
Dents, turned to him condescendingly:
“Now, my man, your turn has come.
What can I do for you?"
“Oh, nothing special!" was the calm
reply. "I only called In to tell you
that Farmer James’ three cows bad
broken Into your garden and were
smashing everything down. But i see
they have been caught again.”—Pitta
burgh Chronicle-Telegraph.
, THEIR WAY TO HAPPINESS
One Couple That Kept Out of Debt
t and Didn't Keep Up
Appearances.
‘ But they had to keep up appear
ances,” tho other woman declared,
speaking of a young couple who had
lived beyond tho husband’s salary and
were in all Sorts of trouble, according
to the Indianapolis Star.
“Why did they—what appearances?”
the woman opposite askod.
“Why, they had to live to some ex
tent at least like tholr friends did, the
people they were thrown with. They
had to live in a nice neighborhood
and dress respectably and entertain a
little once In a while.”
“No," the woman opposite insisted.
“They only thought they did. They
were merely ‘keeping up with Lizzie'
and didn't know how foolish It was
when they couldn’t afford !t."
“But what could they I ove done?
They couldn’t go and live in he slums
and they had to 1 . . . i’.eir self
respect.”
“It depends upon what you call self
respect. 1 can maintain mine best
by not going in debt up to ray eyes.
And it wasn’t nerc- - *-r them to
go to the slums, ’ . .i.. fioso may
bo. I know a co, !e who .'ound two
rooms out on a s’ lo st-<- * and went
to housekeeping in ■ i. - -th the few
bits of furniture th •' "'’•’l afford to
buy. Moat of tin i. v edd. g presents
were packed away as not suitable
for their environ ”" t They were
several miles awav from the arlsto
tratlc nelghborhot.l y"T v hich they
were most familiar, but they didn’t
mind that. ’
“I should have thought they would.”
“At any rate they didn’t mind it
enough to put off getting married until
the man got a big salary. ’
“Did their friends come to see
them?”
"They certainly did. Some of the
callers came from curiosity. I suppose,
and some probably pitied them, but
they wore perfectly happy Just the
same. The point was that they did
not spend more than they had and
even out of the little they saved some
thing.”
“But didn’t they have to go shab
by?”
“They did sometimes; they went
without many things to which they
were accustomed, but you see they
were very much in love and they had
counted the cost and were prepared.”
“What about them now?”
"Oh, they are living In a house of
their own, but I doubt If they are any
happier than when they were going
without In their two rooms. But they
proved to me that it is not necessary
to keep up appearances.”
Diet lor Acidity of the Stomach.
Acidity of tho stomach and ulcer
ated stomach are largely on the in
crease, in both England and America,
If statistics are to bo believed. And
Dr. Willard J. Stone of Toledo. 0.,
points out in the Journal ot the Amer
ican Medical Association that these
are the two countries in which the
consumption of sugar Is greatest.
Doctor Stono recommends an almost
starch and sugar free diet for per
sons troubled with this acidity. He
says tho following article of food may
bo eaten with safety: Fresh fruit
pulp or fruit Juices, such as grapefruit,
oranges, peaches and watermelon,
without sugar; broth, soft-boiled or
poached eggs, fish, chicken, broiled or
baked moats, bacon, milk, tea, cream,
butter, green vegetables, such as as
paragus, spinach, cauliflower, water
cress, endives, squash, carrots, tur
nips, lettuce, fruit and lettuce salads,
with olive oil dressing containing a
very small quantity of lemon Juice;
Brazil nuts, pecans or filberts.
The following foods are prohibited:
Candy, sugar, sirups and condiments;
the fresh fruits which contain more
than ten per cent carbohydrates,
such as apples, pears, bananas, cher
ries, currants, plums; of the vege
tables, peas, parsnips, beans, potatoes,
corn; tho cereals, rice, macaroni,
bread, crackers, cocoa, chocolate and
coffee.
Cottonseed Flour.
It has recently been discovered that
flour made from cottonseed Is a valu
able food for general consumption, and
an Inexpensive substitute for meat. It
Is remarkably high in protein, which
la the nutrient, or flesh-producing, sub
stance in meat, and Is readily digested
by the gastric Juices. It is also said
to be quite palatable and satisfying.
Cottonseed flour Is made from the
kernel of the seed after the oil has
been pressed from It. It Is a highly
concentrated food and Is In no way
Intended to replace wheat flour or oth
er cereals, and cannot safely bo so
used, because an excess ot protein is
probably as damaging to the human
system as a lack of It. It Is supposed
to be mixed with three or four parts
of wheat flour and made into bread.
Teuton Hydroaeroplane.
Details regarding a Teuton hydro
aeroplane which fell Into tho hands of
the Russians In the Riga region are of
unusual interest In that they disclose
the thoroughness w ‘h which German
air craft are finished and equipped.
To quote from the report of the Morn
ing Post correspondent at Petrograd:
“All the necessary manipulating parts
of the machinery are made luminous
at night with a radium composition.
There is a special compass, and seats
are provided for three. The hydro
aeroplane carries a searchlight, a
Maxim, and a rifle, with an adequate
supply of ammunition, and ten bombs, |
five on each aide, of ton pounds weight !
apiece.”

I By MAY RIDPATH \
(Copyright, 1916, by W. Q. Chapman.)
“Gentlemen,” spoke Robert Dale,
arising at the table where his man
guests had Just finished their cigars
after the ladies had retired from the
room, “1 am going to announce that
this is the last social function where
wo may meet under present pleasant
conditions. 1 am going to give up
this house tomorrow and remove tq
mure humble quarters.”
There was a dead silence. Thera
was not a person in view who had not
for several days past heard rumors of
. a great money loss for the supposedly
wealthy owner of the splendid man
sion that now harbored them. Could
It be possible that there was a tangl,
ble foundation to these current ru
mors. The interested group soon
knew, for Mr. Dale continued:
“I will remove tomorrow into the
more humble and appropriate garden
er’s house. You will all be welcome
in our more modest quarters, Just as
you have been here.”
Then, the bland, courteous host ns
ever, Mr. Dale motioned them in the
direction of the drawing rooms.
| “Ruined!”
“1 heard he was speculating In war
brides!”
“Too bad for the expectations of
that amiable son of his, Vance Dale!”
These and like remarks began to go
the rounds of the guests. Many left
early. Some neglected even to ac
knowledge Hie compliment of their In
vitation. And when they were all de
parted Mr. Dale walked over to his |
stalwart, handsome son and clasped
“I Shall Always Be Your Friend.”
his hand, as though there was some
understood bargain between them, and
winked and even chuckled with lu
dicrous solemnity.
“And now, young man, to shoulder
the stately forest ax and work for a
living!” he said.
The town was agog the next morn
ing as Vance Dale, wearing a hickory
shirt and bearing an ax over his sturdy i
shoulder, started “to work.” Mr. Dale
owned a pasture lot, at one end coy- :
ered by a thick grove of trees. These
were to be sacrificed for their value as j
fuel.
Shades were raised, curtains were ,
drawn aside, doors were opened a
crack. Feminine Warcham stared and !
marveled. The fastidious, cultured, |
■ luxury-reared Vance was compelled to i
work like a common laborer! Tho j
Dales had become poor! They were
no longer tho society leaders of the (
place! Tho cold shoulder of tho
world was voted.
There were three houses that Dale
passed which were of peculiar Inter t
est to him. Since he had come back |
from college he had been attracted by
three young ladies of tho town. His j
father encouraged him in preparing '
the way to choose a wife. Eunice VVII- |
lard was the most graceful, or rather
majestic, young indy in the place. She j
had seemed to him the ideal of wom
anhood. As he neared her home Vance
saw her coming down the street. She
noticed him, paused and quickly re
turned to the house.
“A cut—a snub!” rather bitterly so- i
liloqulzed Vance. “All right—father j
said she was a fair-weather friend.”
His face grew brighter as he looked i
towards the home of Kitty Darling.
She was a sweet, kittenish piece of
humanity. She came bounding out to
the rustic gate, piquant and eager.
His heart warmed towards her.
“Oh, dear Mr. Vance!” she prattled, j
■T have cried half the night over the j
great misfortune of your poverty that |
has come to you. But 1 shall always
be your friend, for It was you who In
troduced me to dear Aleck Wayne, i
and we became engaged last night." I
“Um!” almost growled Dale, as he
went his way. “I don’t seem to have
impressed ladles as 1 fancied. As
Helena Wayne,” and ne glanced at tne
great show place of Wareham, “of
course I am clear out of her set now."
The Waynes, as he knew, were out
of town, but when they heard of the
Dale descent m the social scale of .
course they would Join the selfish
timeserving majority. Vance felt I
pretty bitter as he thought ot all hla
trio of charmers. He had aspired |
most to stately, but warm-hearted,
Helena
“I must put her out of my mind,” Me
| ruminated, ‘ although ha thought of
, her in a solace.”
The peerless Helena floated in im
agery before nlra all that day. It was
a strenuous one. He came home at
night with blistered hands and lame
and strained muscles, but, ob, how be
ate and slept! His soul awoke as he
learned early next morning that tho
Waynes had returned. His heart gave
a great bound as at quitting time that
afternoon he threw aside his ax. His
hands were a sight, raw and bruised,
a log had rolled over his foot and he
was quite lame. Just as he gained
the road an automobile whizzed up.
Helena Wayne was driving the ma
chine.
“For you!” she cried in happy, al
most jolly tones, pointing to the lux
uriously cushioned rear seat. “Shall
I betray my real interest in a good
friend and confess that I drove out in
the hopes of giving you a lift, for I
have heard terrible stories ot your
martyrdom,” ami she glanced pitying
ly at the scratched, swollen hands.
He wondered, as she drove to tho
post office, it she was not just showing
the people of the town that she was
not a bit ashamed ot acquaintance
ship with a man wearing a hickory
shirt and earning his bread by the
sweat of his brow.
The removal from the big house to
the little one had been effected. It
was wonderful, how accommodatingly
the harmonious three accepted tho
vast “change in their fortunes.” Mrs.
Dale smiled quietly, her husband went
about chuckling serenely to himself,
Vance called everything snug and com
fortable.
And, lo and behold! Just as dusk
sot in Helena, who had so accommo
datingly and proudly driven Vance
home, appeared with her father. Evi
dently the interested maiden had ad
vised Mr. Wayne of tho frightful con
dition of tho hands of the novice ax
man, and her fat her, at one time a
doctor, had brought a lotion that
would give tho sufferer ease.
"They're true blue,” observed Mr
Dale, after tho Waynes had gone, and
a great glow of comfort settled down
In the heart of tho longing Vance.
It diffused still more intensely as, the
second day after that, Miss Wayne
appeared at the old pasture lot armed
with easel and artist outfit.
“I want to make a sketch of the old
timber before you devastate the land
scape,” she explained to Vance, and
he found for her a comfortable shaded
spot and did little tree chopping that
morning.
There was a gloomy day or two for
the woodchopper. Then sunshine
and happiness were his lot again, for
Miss Wayne appeared, intent on an
other sketch. She had brought her
lunch. He, as well, his own. They
put them together and Vance was on
the verge of delirious bliss.
Miss Eunice Willard heard ot the
“goings on” up at tho pasture lot and
snubbed Helena as she had Vance.
Little Kitty Darling clapped her hands
when, a month later, the rumor be
came current that Helena and Vance
were engaged.
Then one day the gossips were
amazed to observe that the Dales
were moving back into the old house,
and Helena stared broadly as Vance,
Instead ot attending his woodcraft
duties, appeared at her homo with a
new eight-cylinder car.
“Why,” she said, wonderlngly, “Your
work and the charming log cabin we
aro to build —"
“All fiction!’’ cried Vance. "Father
Insisted on a test, and you’re tho one
who met It, you dear, darling, chari
table, pitying—”
She stopped his eulogisms with a
kiss of true love and content.
Bobbie’s Prayers.
“Mother,” yelled little Bobble,
’come on up and hear my prayers."
“Yes, dear, in Just a moment,” his
mother answered. Then she went on
dealing tho cards and became the
possessor ot a good no-trump ha.id.
“Mother," Bobbie yelled, while her
partner was trying to decide whether
to raise the bid to three or not, 'Tome
quick and hear my prayers.”
“Please be quiet,” she replied. “I’ll
come in Just a minute.”
She got it for three In no-trump, and j
tho ((laying proceeded.
“Mother, come and hear my (.ray- !
era,” Bobbie pleaded when she led the
four-spot of hearts, with nothing high- j
er than the nine turned up in tho ;
dummy hand.
“Be still, can’t you?” she answered,
“I’m trying to think.”
Her heart lead gave her opponents
a chance to get in with a long lino of
spades, and before she could establish
her diamonds she had lost six tricks.
“Darn It!” she exclaimed, slapping
her cards down on the table, "how
can you expect a person to do any
thing against such luck?”
Then she went upstairs and hoard
Bobble’s prayers.
If They Told the Truth.
"1 won’t be homo tonight, dear, I’m
going to break loose and see If I can
cure myself of being tired of looking •
at you.”
“Good night! Next time you ask me
to such a poor dinner, put me along
side of somebody who la at least half
witted.”
“There Is absolutely nothing the |
matter with you, madam, except pure !
laziness; but Just to maintain appear |

OLD COURT PROCEDURE
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM
THAT OF THE MODERN DAY.
Elaborate Ceremonial and Dignified
Proceedings Were Frequently Dis
pensed With in the Early Days
of the Country.
| “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Know ye
’ all that the honorable circuit court
of Peoria county now stands convened
pursuant to adjournment."
This is the impressive ceremony
used and the words spoken aloud when
circuit court Judges step to the bench.
In federal courts all spectators and at
taches are required to arise and re
main standing until the court has been
seated.
In the days of 1818 to 1830 things
were different, ns early historical rec
j oi'ds show, observes the Peoria Trib
une. Records of those days show one
incident In which Judge John Rey
! nolds was seated on the circuit bench
I in Washington county when the fol
j lowing procedure was followed:
i "Boys, come In. Our John is going
to hold court," the sheriff said to the
spectators, jurors and attorneys who
had gathered on the grass In the court
j house yard.
! The courts In those days were held
mostly In log houses or In barrooms
of village taverns fitted up for the pur
pose, with a temporary bench for the
' court and benches and chairs arranged
for the jurors, lawyers and spectators.
, In general, the Judges were adverse
to rendering decisions on points of law
and preferred to submit all questions
to tiie Jurors for a decision.
One instance is cited when attorneys
requested the court to instruct the Ju
rors on questions of law. The Judge
after rubbing his head and face with
his bands and reflecting a few mo
ments, said to the lawyers:
“Why, gentlemen, the Jury under*
stands it; they need no instructions;
no doubt they will do justice In this
case."
The same Justice presided in a case
of a man named Green who was con
victed of murder. It became the un
pleasant duty of the judge to pass sen
tence upon the man. He called the
prisoner before him and said:
"Mr. Green, the jury says you are
guilty of murder and the law says you
are to be hung. I want you and all of
your friends down on Indian creek to
know that it is not I who condemn you.
It is the Jury and the law. Mr. Green,
what time would you like to bo bung?
The law allows you time for prepared
ness."
"1 am ready at any time, your honor.
Those who kill the body have no power
to kill the soul. My preparation is
made and I am ready," was the reply
of the prisoner at the bar.
"Mr. Green, it is a very serious mat
ter to bo hung; it can’t happen to a
man butonce In his life. You had bet
ter tako all the time allowed. I will
give you until this day four weeks,"
was the sentence of tho court v
James Turney, attorney general,
who was prosecuting the case, remind
ed the court that it was tho duty of the
Judge to warn the prisoner of the con
sequences he was facing, to reprove
him for his guilt, and to warn him
against the Judgment in the world to
come. The court replied:
“Oh, Mr. Turney, Mr. Green under
stands the whole matter; ho knows he
has got to be bung; you understand
it, don’t you, Mr. Green?"
No Wonder She Chuckled.
In a name there was embarrass
ment for one woman. Her name was
Mrs. Fish. In the lobby of a Broad
way hotel she met Mrs. Roach, and
while she was conversing with her
along came Mrs. Crabb. “Why, this
1s a pleasure, Mrs. Pish,” breezily said
Mrs. Crabb. Mrs. Fish saw the em
barrassment of the situation and hesi
tated before Introducing Mrs. Crabb
to Mrs. Roach. And when she did Mrs.
Crabb, who was a youthful matron,
saw the humor of the situation and
gave vent to a lodd chuckle. Mrs.
Roach was a dignified woman who had
crossed the Rubicon of life. She froze
up immediately. “Who is this bois
terous person, Mrs. Fish?” she asked,
at the same time giving Mrs. Crabb
the icy stare. “I must be going, any
way; so glad to have met you.” And
as Mrs. Roach departed Mrs. Fish
and Mrs. Crabb, who were both young
enough to be in the swim, laughed up
roariously.
Seventeen Warrior Presidents.
It is interesting at this time, when
tho whole world is talking about the
greatest of all wars, and our president
goes out to talk about preparedness,
to mention the fact that 17 of tho 21
presidents were soldiers —Washington,
Jeiferson, Madison. Monroe, Jackson,
Harrison, Taylor, Pierce, Lincoln,
Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Ar
thur, Harrison, McKinley and Roose
velt.
Flustered Savant.
“Is Professor Diggs still Interested
In Egyptology?"
“Oh, yes, but he had a rather trying
experience recently.”
“What happened to him?”
“He -was asked by some of tho local
stage censors just how far, in his opin
ion, an oriental dancer should be per
mitted to go.”
Too Good.
"I hear you’re thinking of buying a
new car."
“Yes. My chauffeur complains that
tho old one doesn’t get out of repair
often, enough."
