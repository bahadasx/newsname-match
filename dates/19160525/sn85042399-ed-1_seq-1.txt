Tidings
Finley Says East
Is Interested
William L. Finley, state biologlBt
and formerly state game warden, vis
ited the Tidings office Wednesday.
Mr. Finley has been lecturing through
the east and displaying moving pic
tures of Oregon. He had the follow
ing to say In regard to Ashland's de
velopment: "While lecturing In Springfield,
Mass., after having lectured In New
York and Boston, Emerson Hough's
great story of Oregon and Crater
Lake came out In the Saturday Even
ing Post. It was fortunate that it
came out at this time for it was fresh
in the public mind at the time I was
giving my lectures and showing my
moving pictures, and all these com
blned to Impress the beauty and won
derful opportunities of Oregon on the
mind of the audience. The picture
of "Fishing In the Rogue River" was
received with pleasure and applause
and several eastern capitalists men
tioned to me after the lecture that
they were going to Oregon to fish in
the Rogue. These people were from
the class who have money and do not
mind spending It to get recreation of
this kind. These people will doubt
less have their summer homes out
here and at the same time will see
the possibilities In southern Oregon
and no doubt become strong invest-
"I cannot help but feel that the
thoughtfulnesg and courtesy shown
Mr. Hough by Mr. Greer when he was
collecting material for his story will
have far-reaching results. It has at
least eiven this district honorable
mention, and this, being followed up
by my lecturing tour and display of
motion pictures, has made an Impres
sion in the east that is worth many
thousands of dollars to the district In
publicity.
"The fish and game commission,
under whose jurisdiction I work, Is
trying to enforce the game laws more
through a matter of educating the
people to a comprehensive under
standing of the necessities of the laws
rather than a compulsory arbitrary
enforcement.
"The lecture tour and moving pic
tures are, of course, purely advertis
ing and is done with the Idea of let
ting the eastern pleasure-seeker act
ually see the sports and scenery of
Oregon.
"During the past four years the
game and fish commission has been
interested In obtaining moving pic
tures, not only of scenery, but of fish
and animal life, and are now ready to
display these In colors. Imagine what
an Impression a colored moving pic
ture of Crater Lake will make In the
heart of the pleasure-seeker who Is
now forced to see America first."
In conclusion Mr. Finley states:
"After having looked over your de
velopment here I cannot help but
wonder whether your people appreci
ate the great work that the springs
commission has done and the tremen
dous possibilities in this line of de
velopment In this beautiful spot. If
they do not now appreciate It they
certainly will in the future. Consid
ering the small amount of money you
have invested, you have gotten tre
mendous and lasting results."
A New Bishop
For Oregon
The general conference of the
Methodist church, now in session at
Saratoga, N. Y., has elected seven
new bishops. Among them is Dr.
Matt S. Hughes of Pasadena, known
as one of the most eloquent preach
ers In America.
It is certainly good to know that
he will soon' ,become the resident
bishop of the northwest, with head
quarters at Portland.
Bishop Hughes is well known to
many of our citizens, having been
one of our Chautauqua attractions In
1909 and again in 1913.
He is the third man, in recent
years, taken from the Southern Ore
gon Chautauqua's talent to become a
bishop In the Methodist church.
He will receive a warm welcome
In Oregon, Washington and Idaho.

Rouse Acquitted
In Circuit Court
Ranee Rouse, who was charged
with giving a way a circular advertis
ing a California liquor mail-order
house and was fined $200 after waiv
ing examination in the Ashland re
corder's court several weeks ago, was
found not guilty of the charge In the
circuit court at Medford Tuesday, to
which he had appealed the case. The
charge of distributing the circular
was brought against Rouse by Dis
trict Attorney Kelly Immediately af
ter a bootlegging charge against
Rouse bad fallen through, the jury
disagreeing. At the time Rouse
waived all examination and asked
that a fine be assessed so that be
could appeal the case to the circuit
court through his attorney, Porter J.
Neff of Medford.
The case was tried Tuesday before
Judge Calkins The Jury was sworn
In at 9 a. m., the taking of evidence
occupying most of the day, and the
verdict being brought In about 3
o'clock. While on the stand Rouse
admitted having given away the circu
lar, but disclaimed any wrong intent
or that he was an agent of any Cali
fornia concern or had received any
recompensation for so doing. In bis
instructions to the jury Judge Calkins
made plain the fact that the act com
mitted was a technical violation of
the law. The jury brought In a ver
dict of not guilty after being out
about thirty minutes. Mayor John
son, Patrolman Wimer and a number
of Ashlanders interested in the case
were in attendance at the trial, and
according to the story told by some
of those who attended, the evidence
and Judge Calkins' statements all
pointed .toward a merely technical
violation.
This case is the first time that this
particular phase of the prohibition
law has come into the courts in Ore
gon, and the outcome was watched
with Interest throughout the state.
Mr. Rouse expresses himself as be
ing "sure glad that all this business
is over," and remarked that "I had
never been mixed up in anything like
this before and wouldn't have gone
through it for a thousand dollars."
Ashland Horse
Wins at Medford
A number of Ashlpnders attended
the races and ball game at Medford
Sunday afternoon. The events were
held at the county fair grounds and
an uneventful ball game, which was
won by Medford from Grants Pass by
a score of 5 to 0, was enlivened by
two running races and a bucking ex
hibition. Wade Hampton, running horse
owned by Jim Bowers of Ashland,
proved to be the fastest piece of
horse flesh entered, much to the de
light of the Ashland contingent. No
doubt Jim will get Wade Into shape
for the round-up races.

Important Meet
Of Fruitgrowers
The big new fruit-marketing plan
worked out by federal experts and
already largely adopted by the lead
ing fruit districts of Washington and
Idaho will be explained and discussed!
May 29 at the Commercial Club at 2
p. m. The Ashland Fruit and Froduco
Association and the Commercial Club
unite in urging everyone to be out
and assist In deciding what this dis
trict Is going to do.
Our national government recog
nizes the fruit marketing situation la
the Pacific northwest to be one ot
tho most serious problems confront
ing agriculture in the United States.
In 1915 at the hearing of the Federal
Trade Commission in tho northwest,
more pressure was brought to bear to
secure direct assistance in perfoctlmj
organization among fruit growers
than for help in any other line of In
dustry. The result was that three ?f
the best experts of the Federal Office
of Markets have spent three months
In devising a plan which will appar
ently greatly relieve the marketing
situation if a large majority of the
tonnage can be controlled by one or
ganization. The Federal Office of Markets
strongly urges that each separate dis
trict In the northwest become thor
oughly acquainted with the plan and
actually organized and drilled in the
fundamentals of marketing, including
physical handling, standardization
and organization. The campaign out
lined by the federal authorities calls
for a threefold plan: First, an ex
planation of the clearing houso plan
for marketing the crop; second, local
problems ot organization; third,
physical handling. It Is necessary
that the business men of a commun
ity as well as tho growers and ship
pers become thoroughly familiar with
the details of this plan. The meeting
on Monday will be addressed by rep
resentatives of the Federal Office of
Markets and the Oregon Agricultural
College.
The plan will be presented to th
fruit groweiB In order that they may
determine what this district will do.
If it Is decided at this meeting to ac
cept the plan, steps will be immedi
ately taken to bring about the neces
sary organization and adjustments.
Committees will be appointed and col
loge or federal representatives will
assist In perfecting final arrange
ments. Fruit growers, bankers and
business men generally throughout
the state recognize the great impor
tance of this matter and are aiding
In flnnnclng the campaign which the
College Extension Service Is now car
rying on. '
