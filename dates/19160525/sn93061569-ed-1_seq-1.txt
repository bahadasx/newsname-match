VOLUME 12
NEW LIGHT THROWN ON
SCHOOL CONTROVERSY
County Superintendent Errett
Points Out that Much Ar
guing is Result of Mis
information In last week's issue of the Clayton
Citizen and also the Clayton News ap
peared a letter written by Mr. E. A.
James, Director of the Tax Payers
Association of New Mexico, to Mr. G.
G. Granville of Clayton, N. M.
In his letter Mr. James endeavors
to point out the inadvisability of main
taining two complete grade schools
in our little city where an enrollment
of but few more than 600 pupils is had.
I do not konw who were Mr. James
informants in regard to school condi
tions in Clayton and the plans of the
Board of Education, but owing to the
erroneous impression his letter may
have caused in the minds of the peo
ple of Union county and especially in
District Number One, I desire to1 set
out the following:
1st. We have in Clayton a school
building containing eight class rooms
and an office. The building contains
bo assembly room, not even a room
large enough to assemble one-fifth of
the present school enrollment neither
does it contain a room suitable for
a chemical or physical laboratory. -
2nd. We have an enrollment of 616
pupils distributed as follows:
Primary 73
First 72
Second 81
Third 61
Fourth 54
Fifth 60
Sixth 30
Seventh 38
Eighth 34
Ninth 23
Tenth 7
Eleventh 3
Total . 516
At present high school students are
all in one room. This leaves an enroll
ment uf 483 pupils for the remaining
rooms or an average of 69 pupils per
room. This is just about twice the
number that can be successfully
taucrht taught by any one teacher. .
Mr. James states that the present
building is in the best location to be
had for high school purposes and that
in his 'opinion the Clayton high school
should be maintained in the present
building, and that a grade school
should be built on the west side of the
track where the primary, first and
second grades should be taught.
It seems that Mr. James', chief ob
ject is to keen down school expenses.
for he states that a multiplication of
school houses increases the number
of teachers and that school expenses
are summed up in just two words,
teachers wages.
Following his suggestion in the
above paragraph relative to teachers,
let us see the results:
On the east side of the track is to be
maintained a complete grade school
emnlovinor nine teachers for the erades
below the high school but nothing is
said regarding the high school.
We know that in order to maintain
a Standard High school as adooted
by the City Superintendents and rnn
cinala in ioint session with the mem'
hers of the State Board of Education
at Albunuernue on November 7, 1912.
and approved by the State Board of
Education February 4. lim, tnat tne
requirements for graduation are Fif
teen (15) units in which number phys
ical training, chorus, glee club, and
orchestra work shall not be counted
A unit of work represents five(5) rec
itations periods of not less than forty
(40) minutes eacn per ween ior a
term ot not less man imny-six ou;
weeks for a four year high school.
The teachincr forceof an. accredited
or standard four year high school
! shall not be less than three teachers
who devote their entire time to the
teaching of high school subjects.
Mr. James does not presume to say
that Clayton is not entitled to a stan
dard Four Yeir Hieh school, but he
does ony that all of the above work
which remires a teaching force of at
Vast tp've (12) shall be conducted
in our little eight room school build
ing. This we see at a glance is a
iliysiciil impossibility.
Follo'Hncr Mr. James' line of reason
inc we find that he suggests a teach
ing force of sixteen teachers for our
schools. On the other hand, the
Board of Education knowing that our
financial resources are limited, pro
poses to give Clayton an up-to-date
grade and high school with a teaching
force of not to exceed fourteen teach
ers.
It seems to me that the Bource of

Had to Raise the Ante or Quit the
Triangle and Metro
Slats Rankin of the Mission wishes
to assure the public that when he
found it necessary to raise the prices
on Triangle and Metro nights from
5 and 15 cents to 10 and 20 cents
there was just one reason for it. Slats
says it was a question of discontinuing
Triangle and Metros or raising the
price. In addition to the high priced
service, to maintain a house like the
Mission is a heavy expense and the
employment of good music is a fea
ture that takes real money to procure.
The Citizen notices Slats sets the
rather enviable record of giving Clay
ton folks Triangle features from ten
days to two weeks ahead of any other
town in the entire state. We believe
that Slats' explanation is not neces
sary regarding the advance in prices.
Clayton folks as a rule don't lose
much sleep over a nickel, and we be
lieve they prefer the feature pictures
to the amount saved by seeing infer
ior pictures.
Two Boys and $80 Disappear Together
Two young men giving their names
as Haddock and Savage, former em
ployees of the Franklin hotel at Tex
line, were placed in the county jug
Monday following a chase from Tex
line where it is alleged they lifted
$80 belonging to Ida Higginbottom,
also an employee of the Franklin ho
tel. Ray Büsey and Dr. T. S. Dyson of
Texline are largely responsible for the
capture of the suspects. When Miss
Higginbottom discovered and made
known that her money 'was missing,
Hadock hinted that Savage should be
"frisked" for the money. The. stall
was so good and Savage stood the
frisk so well that suspicion was divert
ed from the two. Savage, it whs later
disclosed, had his share of the money
"up his sleeve" inside the lining.
When darkneos came Sunday night
the boys faded away. They walked
to Clayton where they were seen and
recognized by a train crew who wired
the information .back to Texline.
Messrs. Busey and Dyson came in pur
suit in a car, found the boys in the
north railroad yards where one of
them had buried $30 which is reported
hs being part of the stolen money. . It
is said that one of the boys confessed
The other, when searched, had about
$40 on him which he could not account
for. They were taken to Texline Wed

Why the Paper was Late
The ding-bad on the heez-gow that
controls the reverse english on our cyl
inder press went ka-bluey and refused
to print just after the final four
pages were ready to run. The Citi
zen's foreman, "J.mmie" Plank, is of
a disposition that does not tolerate
cussing hence, of course, there was
no chance to make the balky brute
work.
With the assistance of two machin
ists,! carload of tools and much pam
pering and coaxing the press once
more consents to grind out the printed
sheet for the clamoring multitude.
It is with pleasure that we announce
the ding-bat and heez-gow are again
doing business at the same old stand.
Democrats' Actions Hint Dissatisfac
tion
Santa Fe, N. M., May 34. If any
evidence was needed to prove that
there is great dissatisfaction in the
democratic party, the failure of the
county conventions to important coun
ties to mention the administration of
Governor McDonald, although endors
ing the Wilson administration, and
usually Jones, would be sufficient.
The administration democrats of
this place are very much disgusted
because of the action of Grant and
other counties in the endorsing busi
ness, and when the democrats of this
county met Inst Friday they did the
endorsing right.
Club Closes Season
V
Howard Moore entertained the Eve
ning Bridge club Wednesday night at
the M. C. Johnson home. This mark
ed the close of the season for the
club. At midnight the party repaired
to the Pullman cafe for lunch. The
season's losers ore to entertain the
winner in the near future at the Gar
den of the Gods on the Porter place.
Cupid Fell Down
For the first timo in 1916 Cupid
has fallen asleep at the switch. For
a strentch of 10 days nothing has hap
pened on the marriage record and as
we go to press the unusual condition
still exists.
Got a G-.ldcn Eagle
Ira Pennington performed the feat
of picking a golden eagle out of the
iir with a .25 high power rifle last
Friday while scouting about the coun
try. Mr. Pennington says the bird
was about 300 or 400 feet hirrh when
he shot He considered having it
mounted but has abandoned the idea.

Clayton Amateur Team Makes Good
Showing Against Salaried
Bunch
Dalhart got away with the large end
of a rather close score Sunday when
that city's salaried bunch met Clayton
nm:t"urs in the opening ball gnme
of the season. The result was 4 to 2.
That the season promises to be in
teresting was evidenced by the big
crowd that turned out and strong in
terest of the fans vocal and other
wise, and the manner in which the
boys performed.
Pitcher Morton, late of Trinidad,
was on the mound for Clayton and
worked in a thoroughly creditable
manner considering that he had never
worked out with the local bunch. We
understand Morton will become a
member of the pitching staff.
It was natural to suppose that Clay
ton would lose this game. Two or
three of the "regulars" were absent,
and although all the boys gave an ex
cellent account of themselves it was
evident that the confidence and team
work that comes with much practice
was absent.
Clayton fans, as well as the business
men who are behind the team with
their financial support are well sat
isfied with Sunday's exhibition.
Clayton will meet the same aggre
gation Sunday at Dalhart, and a game
vvith the Cheyenne Indians is con
templated for next week with Clayton
on the home grounds.
Many cars are expected to accom
pany the team to Dalhart Sunday.
Stead School Closes
Appropriate and entertaining exer
cises marked the closing of the Stead
school last Saturday night. Many com
pliments were extended Miss Ednn
Haug, teacher of this school in behalf
of her ability to prepare the thorough
ly enjoyable affair. One of the hits
of the evening was the tabloid min
strel given by the boys of the school,
the tableau representation of Long
fellow's famous poem, "Excelsior."
Several impromptu numbers were ren
dered, among them the solos of Ray
r-jioy, were well received.
After the program the sale of boxes
with Ira Ma-sscy as auctioneer enter
tained the crowd and got some loose
change in sight. As a money getter
Ira is worth considering. Of all the
boxes he offered for sale none brought
less than $2, and all proved worth
the money.
