INTERNATIONALISM IS

By Mrs. Percy V. Pennybacker,'

NEW YORK, May 25.-?A step'
from nationalism to internationalism
bo that assistance may be rendered in
a world-wide movement by women to
"harmonize the nations" after the
close of the European war, is recom
mended to the General Federation of
Women's Clubs by Mrs. Percy V.
Pennybacker, of Austin, Tex., in her
report, as president', read here today
at the thirtenth biennial convention
J of the Federation.
] "Whiie we call ourselves the Gen

Assistant Secretary

Discusses the Rural Credits Bill
, before State Bankers' As

WHEELING. W. Va.. May 25?
Declaring that the question of re
lief for farmers was a non-partisan
movement and that the future pros
perity of the country depended In
large measure on lower Interest
rates for the farm mortgages, Wil
liam A. Malburn, assistant secretary
of the treasury, today dlscusBed tie
rural credits bill before the West
Virginia Bankers' Association.
"Over one-third of our people are
farmers, or depends upon thom."
said Mr. Malburn. "The value of our
farms Is not less than 140,000,090,
000 and the value of the annual
product Is calculated to be |8,G00,
000.000. It was estimated by Presi
dent Taft in 1912 that the farmers
were paying eight and one-half per
cent Interest on borrowed capital of
approximately $6,000,000,000, a
much higher rate than Is paid by
merchants, manufacturers, transpor-.
tatlon companies or those engaged
In any other line of Industry at all
comparable In alxe with that of ag
riculture. The average Interest rate
charged the farmer In the state
where conditions are most favorable
!b nearly six per cent or thirty-three
and one-third per cent more than
tho highest rate paid by the farmer
In Germany to hlB l&ndschaft, where
the prevailing rate varies from three
and one-half to four and one-half
per cent.
"The result of this enormous bur
den which the farmer Is obliged to
carry Is the creation of a great social
and economical problem. The social
problem is the trend of population
from the farm to the city. The eco
nomic problem Is the Increasing cost
of living, the greater part of which
Is due to the Increased non-produo
tlve population, and the diminishing
returns to those engaged In agricul
ture.
"There have been many attempts
to turn back the tide from the farm

long-established National Council of
Women in the United States.
"I will confess that there is a
deeper reason that makes me so eage
to see this brought to pass. When
the cruel war is over and peace comes
we shall find In the international
council an organization that is ready
?ready for harmonizing the nations
which are now at war?ready for
calling back into wise common coun
sel women who for so many years
were accustomed to work Bide by side.
"I pray that the 2.000,000 women
of the federation may have the priv
ilege of Bitting in the council and nf
helping to bring back ioy and har
mony to the women of the world."
Mrs. Pennybacker made other rec
ommendations of importance to the
future activities of the federation.
One of these urged that the organi
zation "go on record as favoring a
continuance of effort on the lines of
improvement of rural life and tha
Americanization of the immigrant."
In this connection the president ex
plained that her administration, hav
Ig "early felt the need of proper al
liance with the government," had es
tablished a system of co-operatlci
with the departments of agriculture,
interior and labor.
"Every club which Is willing to aid
the government in Americanizing the
immigrant," Mrs. Pennybackcr urge^
"is invited to send the name of Its
president of the federation. These
names will be filed with the commis
sioner of Immigration. When a for
eign family lands, destined for a town
in which a woman's club exiBts, if the
commissioner finds on his list thrt
this club has signified its willingness
to co-operate, a letter will Imme
diately be sent to the president of the
club. It Is not money that these peo
ple want, but it is the touch of hu
man sympathy, the assurance that
there Is a place for them in the com
munity, that women know so well
how to give."
These alliances with the govern
ment branches,- Mrs. Pennybacker
declared, "strengthens us, place ns
in th dignified position where we bo
long, and aid us in doing efficient
scientific work; each step thus taken
helps our government and, if we are
sane in our action, each such co-op
erative step helps the whole cause (t

ROBINSON SPEAKS
TO GREAT CROWD
And Schuck Exposes One of
Abe Lilly's Campaign
Tricks in Wheeling. ?
CHARLESTON, May 25.?-Speak
Ing before a crowd which packed the
Plaza theater to overflowing, filling
the aisles and leaving a stream of
people that extended clear to the
street, Judge Ire E. Robinson made
his first appearance on the stump
here last night In the interest of his
| candidacy for the Republican nomi
nation for governor. The distin
guished jurist was enthusiastically
received and the personnel or the au
I dlence which was made up of coal
miners, working men of all classes,
clerks, business men, professional
men, bankers and coal operators,
showed exclusively that the Taylor
county candidate is the logical choice
of the entire party. The speaker
maintained his usual dignified pose
stating the principles upon which he
based his candidacy and declaring
that he would rather keep his man
hood undeflled than be governor of
West Virginia. Responding to the
issues of the campaign he said "I
have no slush fund to.further the in
; terests of my candidacy. I am de
| pending on the sterling manhood of
you men of this great mountain state.
I I would rather have that than all the
1 money that Vinson, McKell Huston
and the rest of that crowd could
raise."
Charles J. Schuck, of Wheeling,
followed Judge Robinson and made a
! magnificent address appealing to the
I people to support "The unbossed and
unbought candidate of all the peo
ple." He gave Abe Lilly a terrific
arraignment and scoffed at his claim
to being unbossed.
"Why if Abe Lilly becames gov
ernor of West Virginia, the Thanks
giving day proclamation will not dare
leave the governor's office without
first being blue penciled Dy Taylor
Vinson," he declared. "Abe Lilly
unbossed gentlemen, he Is bossed,
bought and paid for."
Mr. Schuck declared that Ohio
county would give Robinson at least
15,000 majority. He cited a case of
where Abe Lilly In soliciting the
vote of Charles Grlbben, a Wheeling
stree car conductor, several days ago,
told him "he ought not to be for Rob
inson is a dry man and a brother-in
law of Judge Dayton, thereby Imply
ing that If Lilly were elected it would
be an easy matter to get beer and
whiskey Into the state." A man who
makes that kind of a campaign Is not
fit to be governor of any state," ho
declared.
He declared he was one of the first
men to go to Judge Robinson and
urge him to become a candidate for
governor and said that at that time
the Judge told him he did not know
whether the administration would bn
for him or against him but that it
would not make any difference If ho
decided to get into the race,
Hr. Schuck declared that he had
been informed that Lilly tried to dis
suade Judge Robinson from getting
into the race and threatened to brand
him with "Hatfieldlsm" when tho
