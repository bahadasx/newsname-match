where the country has jone'S far
wrong as it has in the matter of
its relations with the Indians, it is
necessary to view the subject from
all sides. Thus we have to con
sider the Indian's pie^ent status as
it is affected by what is known n
the Government's Executive Dc
partment as the Indian Bureau.
This branch of the government
service came into existence when
it became necessary for the gov
ernment to protect the outnum
bered Indians from the ravages of
the palefaces who had come into
possession of and dominated that
portion of the western country that
had formerly constituted the In
dian's domain and where the In
dians did not exist in such num
bers as to nuke them secure
against the aggression of the civi
lized pale face.
K*. At first, the reservations wore
established as a temporary means
of fixing a locality for the Indians
where they would be protected
from the maraudiag wild, western
er of the plains, with whom might
was the only right and who, as a
matter of diversion, in the absence
of other materi il as a target for
,his marksmanship was ready to
^/draw his gun on the Indian. The
tendency to perpetuate an institu
tion which was established by the
government for a special purpose
made necessary by the conditions
then existing, but which would, as
a matter of couise, ceac to be.
within a generation, is character
istic of the dead calm which often
overtakes the national intelligence
It is the same sloth fulness of
mental action that manifests itself
in the individual. Nothing in the
natural order of things warrants
the keeping up of the Indian Bur
eau at Washington. It has now
no place as a branch of the gov
ernment itself. It was in its
ception, and is today, a mere at
tachment to the regular govern
v ment machinery yet the fact that
it was established seems to be
sufficient reason for continuing it
when the exercise of a little
thought would demonstrate that it
is a hindrance to the Indian's ad
vancement.
All that is necessary to do is to
accept the fact that the Indian is a
man, a citizen of the United States
and that there is nothing about
him now that requires the special
attention of the government. Let
hilm
assume the place to which
ul I,
nothing is done to cure the man's
lameness he will cling to them.
But the moment he is brought to
the point where he does not need
crutches he lays them aside as a
useless incumbrance to locomo
tion.
The Indian Bureau v.ill never
do a vay with itself. It has be
come so extended in the matter of
i oilice holding that it exists now
more for the purpose of aiding the
polit'crin than for any go )d to the
In lian.
Ic has become a formidable
branch of the government and it
is going to be a difficult thing to
it out of the way. It furnishes

persons that it would be useless to

will be managed and his rights Lj
maintained by th aiuc laws and
regulations that control in the casc|

The Indian is rvady to adapt
himself to the pursuits in which

tence. We realize that it would
be a bo .it as easy to remove a
mountain as it would be to get a
bill through Congress abolishing
the Indian Bureau. It therefore
becomes absolutely necessary to
terminate its existence by getting
the Indians out of its control and
like a mill without grist to grind,
it would soon be out of business.
It is a stumbling block in the road
which the Indian is compelled to
travel.
Those connected with the Bur
eau in an administrative capacity
well know if the course we sug
gest is pursued the Bureau
would be put out of business and
therefore, the plan which must be
adhered to is to keep the Indian
where he is and thus provide an
excuse for continuing the Bureau.
This is what keeps the Indian
where he is today, neither in nor
out of civilization. He is neither
independent of the government
nor yet part of it. On the reser
vation there is nothing to stimu
late him to action. Nothing for
him to look forward to. Noth
ing to excite in him a hope of bet
te ing his coudition.
A human being cannot be stati
onary. By virtue of his construc
tion ho is either going forward or
b.ckward. This is the situation
of the Indian on the reservation.
Withdrawn as he is from those
influences which surround men in
the midht of civilization he leads a
rmr negative existence. He is
doing nothing to improve himself
or thoMi around him. He is with
out even the pleasure of entertain
im,' bright hopes for his children.
There is nothing to encourage him
in any direction. He does, how
ever, entertain hope which, though
not so realized by him, is an ex
ceedingly vain and foolish one,
namely, a hope that through the
Indiau Agent there will come to
him, in some way, at some time, a
relief from his degrading environ
ments and that he will be brought
into the life which he sees the pale
face enjoying that he will become
a man among men with all the
rights that men generally have.
The Indian is a thinking, reason
ing being, endowed with like fac
ulties as are given to other men.
And th nigh untutored he is not
unmindful of himself as to what

moves him to revolt at the sug

about him that should excite par

Indian Service Should Be
Reorganized.
THE TOMAHAWK is not an advo
cate of the entire and complete
abolishment of the Indian office at
Washington, but it does believe it
should be reorganized along prac
tical lines by a commission consist
ing of experienced employes of the
office and also members of Indian
tribes who have had legal experi
ence as well as experience with
their own people, and who cannot
be controlled by selfish interests.
If Congress would pass a law to
create such a commission the
troubles which are now caused by
the field service of the office might
cease to exist.
There is not a reservation In
dian wno does not know that the
responsibility for the failure of
the government's Indian policy is
due entirely to the field service.
Unfortunately for the Indians the
employes in the field service are
all under the protection of the
civil service law. a law so far as
the Indian service is concerned
that has proven to be an utW
failure.
It would be far better for the
Indians if superintendencies were
abolished and the old policy of In
dian agencies was reinstated. Un
der the present system of superin
tendencies if a superintendent is a
failure, or is dishonest at one res
ervation, he is transferred to an
other instead of being prosecuted
for the violations of law which he
has committed. This probably
has caused the members of Con
gress, regardless of parties, to be
come so strtmgly opposed to the
Indian office as it is evident they
now are.
There is no doubt that a bill
which would provide for the abol
ishment of superintendencies
would meet with the combined op
position of all superintendents as
did the Right of Nomination Bill,
but this should not prevent In
dians from trying to get an Indian
office reorganization bill introduc
ed in Congress with the provision
therein relative to superintenden
cies.
So far as Congress is concerned
it can be relied upon to do what is
for the best interests of the In
dians if it can obtain the proper
information.

Steenerson And His In
dian Work.
Has Congressman Steenerson's
work in Congress always been for
the best interests of the Chippe
was? This is a question which is
now confronting the latter.
In 1903, during Mr. Steener
son's first campaign for Congress,
it was suggested by a resident of
this place that the managers of the
annual celebration for that year
should invite him as the principal
speaker of that occasion, but IIP
declined to come on the grounds
that it being court week he would
be unable t get away. The same
person who suggested to the man
agers to invite him then wrote him
a personal letter saying that if he
was a candidate /or Congress it
would be to his interest to attend
the celebration as one of the speak
ers. In reply to that letter he
telegraphed that he had arranged
for the disposition of his cases,
and would be able to come here
and attend the celebration. He
came here, made 8 good speech
which took with the reservation
public. It was while he was here
upon that occasion that another
member of the reservation induced
him to pledge himself to support
the additional allotment bill then
pending in Congress, and on ac
count of that pledge he was elect
ed by the reservation vote which
was cast almost solidly for him,
for, outside of the reservation rote
JudgviOrindeland, who wss also a
candidate for Congress, defeated
him by two or three hundred votes,

but the reservation vote gave him
a plurality of less than one hund
red votes and he received the nom
ination.
During'the following session of
Congress Mr. Steenerson fulfilled
his pledge and secured the passage
of the additional allotment act
The Chippewas were duly appreci
ative of his services and adopted
him as a member of the tribe, but
the Secretary of the Interior re
fused to approve of the adoption
on the grounds that Mr. Steener
son was a member of Congress
when he rendered the Indians the
service.
During every election since then
the Chippewas have voted for Mr.
Steenerson, but he has never since
the passage of the additional allot
ment act aided them in any way,
but on the contrary has supported
legislation which has not been in
their interests, or has himself in
troduced the bills and pushed them
through Congress, or has urged
the committees of Congress to
recommend them.
There are two bills now pending
in Congress in which Mr. Steener
son has taken more than usual in
terest, one is to take for public
school purposes twenty acres of
land which has been used for the
annual celebration although one
acre would be a large tract for
the purpose, and the other is to
legalize many fraudulent land
deals by giving probate courts
jurisdiction although any honest
deal could be arranged through
the Interior Department.

Mr. Steenerson has taken, with
one exception, against Chippewa

The Indian appropriation act
recently passed by Congress con
tains an amendment which pro
vides that members of the Minne
sota Chippewa bands shall receive
preference for the positions in the
Indian service the salaries of which
are paid from Chippewa tribal
funds. Inasmuch as even the
superintendents among the Chip
pewas are paid from tribal funds,
there should bo no hesitancy
among those who wish for thevSe
positions to apply for them.
In order that those who may
wish to apply for positions may
obtain the endorsement of the
tribe, applications should be filed
with the president of the General
Council, so that he might submit
them to the council at its next an
nual meeting.

him at the forthcoming election.
One or two delegations from
this reservation sought Mr. Steen
erson's assistance but failed to ob
tain it, and one of the delegates
afterwards refused to recognize
him when he came here on an
electioneering tour.
