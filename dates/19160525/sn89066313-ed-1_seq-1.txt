Sensing an alien presence in her
room at .1; Missouri avenue last
night jtt. i tootsteps had given warn
in? ol J prurtlir in the house. Miss
l.i.r tia I mo br.ivelv got out o! ucil

ju-.t a he 'l'l s' a '"an appeared
between lie-- au!J tile window. She
(.ahlx-ii a pillow ami hurled it at the
intruder.
Tlie man caught the pillow and
threw it back at her. Then he made
a dash for the jiirl, grabbed her and
hurled her on the. bed on top of her
roommate. Miss .Margaret Kitter.
The screams of the girls reached
every corner of the house ajid pene
trated the houses of neighbors. Dogs
added theii barks to the din. All the
girls Inuig in the house fifteen of
them- rushed from their rooms and
huddled in the hallways.
The man had escaped after throw
lug Miss Fuuke on the bed.
Prowler Third Reported.
The prowler was the third or per
haps, as some of the- girls believe, the
same who has frightened girls in Co
lumbia houses this week. Head Hall
and Sampson Hall were the first vis
ited. It was after midnight last night
when the man' stole into the home of
.Mrs S E. Kverly on .Missouri ave
nue Miss Hitter and .Miss Kunke,
both students of the University, oc
cujij the room at the head of the stuir
wa on the s.-cond Hoor. They were
avvakeii-d bv the "creak creak
creak'' of .stealthy footsteps on the
stairs.
Hreatlilcssl) they listened, scarce
It moving The footsteps came near
er, crimed the hall and eiitereU the
room, the ligure keeping III the
shadows. The girls couldn't see anj
thing, hut they felt the presence of
the man in Uie room. They talked in
frightened- whispers, but the ligure in
the darkness stood still.
Cmpcs in Darkness fur Snitch.
Then, unable longer to stand the
suspense, Miss Kunke left her bed to
grope in the darkness for the light
switch.
Just as in tlie Head Hall and Samp
sou Hall cases, the man was able to
dash to safety before the house was
jaroused. The police were called aim
searched through the neighborhood,
but fouirJ no trace of the intruder.
Prof J. E. Wrench led a rescue
party of students to the scene, but
tliey had no mure luck than the police.
The prowler had escaped, even clos
ing the doors behind him.
Not a girl was willing to go back to
Vbed. They turned on all the lights in
the house and sat up the rest of the
night in two groups, while Professor
Wrench slept on a couch downstairs.
.Negro I'rmvler Seen .Near House.
Lee B. Stevinson, who lives across
the street from Mrs. Everly's, saw a
negro lurking about the Kverly house
jesterday evening. The negro't
movements excited his suspicion. As

ro ran.
V : Kunke, vvu . room was invad

I experience late yesterday afternoon.
With Miss .Nan Honhain, a fellow stu
dent, she went into the basement of
the Gordon Hotel Iliiilding, whicn
houses the home economics depart
ment of the University, to get some
supplies There were no lights. The
1 two girls entered a room and the door
squeaked behind them.
Present Iv the dour squeaked again;
then there was silence.
Alarmed, the girls remaimU quiet.
Whoever was in the nuni with them
nade no movement.
"Shall we call for help?" -Miss
Fluke, said to her companion. "There
are people in the office upstairs and
thy would hear us."
As she spoke the dour squeaked
again, and the prowler slipped out of
lie rooin.

It wasn't a ,oda fountain on wheels

Two large chemical tanks on the
truck were the misleading features
which caused Mr. Kurtz to be besieged
with requests for pink soda-pop when
he stopped at small towns to demon
strate. Mr. Kurtz, accompanied by A. T.
Ixivelace, the demonstrator from Kan
sas City, Kaii., arrived in Columbia at
7 o'clock last night after a twenty
four hour trip.

NURSE MAKES REPLY
IS CASEJIrjACTORY
"I'm Willing to Suggest
Remedies for the Condi
tions," She Declares.
URGES A FEW RULES
Sanitary Regulations Could
Be Enforced, Asserts
Aliss Hamilton.
"I have nothing against the .shoe
tactory, but I am interested in the
welfare of the people of Columbia,"
said Missi Bertha Hamilton, visitina,
nurse of the Charily Organization So
ciet, when asked by a Missourian ic
porlei if she had any reply to ma
to the statement in Tuesday's Mis
scuiian by I'aul I.. Hogan, superin
tendent of the Hamilton-Brown shoe
faclery, that he would pay her if she
could stop tho iiieu from spit! At.; on
the floor of the factory. "I v.'ouM line
to t.ee the place cleaned up bjciuse
vv cannot get rid of tubereulosi.; as
!ong as they just grow it there '
"1 am not a sanitary engineer and
do not wish to be placed oa the pay
roll of the factory, but I will gladly
give such suggestions as ! think
would improve the conditions of the
employes. Workers who cough or
show signs of illness should bo set.t
to a physician for examination and
should not be permitted to return to
work without a certificate showing
that they are able to work and are not
liable to spread their disease to the
other employes.
"Persons in advanced stages of tu
berculosis are not able to do heavy
work. If they work at all the- should
work out-of-doors. The Charity Or
ganization Society takes care of those
who cannot support themselves while
recuperating their strength; so it is
inot necessary for them to work when
they ought not to. If they are permit
ted to work, the danger of infection
iould be minimized by supply in.;
those who expectorate with sputum
cups, such as the Anti-Tuberculosis
Society furnishes its patients. They
co.it less than a cent apiece.
"There is no reason why the fac
tory could not enforce rules against
expectorating as well as any uther
rules.
"Tlie niiin could at least be required
Io keep their own machines clean, and
all dust and dirt could be cleaned
away bp porters after the vlay's work
is done.
"The building should be properly
ventilated at all times and should bo
regularly disinfected.
"These are only a few suggestions
for changes which are necessary to
give the workers conditions which
human beuigs are entitled to. Then,
if they want to do more for the wel
fare of the employes, the managers
can find plenty of good examples set
them by progressive employers all
over the country."

ty. He said the horse show was a
manifestation of the development of
quality. In the opinion of Dean .Mum

better than any other ever held in this
section of the United States. He said
over 200 entries were already on the
lists.
"This will be the largest commence
ment of the University," said Dean
Mumfoi'd, "and 1 am particularly
anxious that all Columbians turn out
for the show. It will help to xive the
University publicity among tlie out-of-town
people."
D. A. Hobnett said that all the mer
chants were boosting tlie show, and
that he considered the Commencement
Horse Show the best to be found.
Ben Column, manager of the show,

ty persons are showing horses, there
will be thirty-six classes, and they
will all be filled, lie said. All three
shows will have goohl horses in the
