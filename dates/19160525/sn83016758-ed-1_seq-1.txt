THE WEEfS DEATHS
Henry Dalchow Prominent Princeton
Farmer Takes Own Life While
Temporarily Insane, Friday.
Mrs. H?nr Jopp Answers the Final
SummonsPaul Gamroth of Fo-
ley Drowned on Frida
The announcement that Henry Dal
chow, a prominent farmer of Prince
ton town, had committed suicide Fri
day afternoon shortly after 3 o'clock,
came as a distinct shock to his numer
ous friends in this village and vicinity.
It appears that Mr. Dalchow was
having a large barn erected, and he
and the carpenters in his employ had
just finished eating their afternoon
lunch. Everyone left the house except
Mr. Dalchow and his daughter, Es
ther, who was clearing away the
dishes. Mr. Dalchow stepped from
the dining room into the kitchen, and
then entered the cupboard where he
kept his guns. He seized a 44-caliber
"Winchester rifle, pointed it at his right
temple, and discharged it. Death re
sulted instantaneously.
Coroner Olsen of Milaca was sum
moned and he arrived at the conclu
sion that deceased came to death at
his own hands while temporarily in
sane. This appears to be the only ex
planation. Mr. Dalchow had com
plained of his health of late, but no
member of his family or others ever
noticed symptoms that indicated that
he was mentally unbalanced.
Brief and simple funeral services
were conducted from the family resi
dence Sunday morning at 9:30 o'clock
by Rev. A. O. Strauch, and the re
mains were laid at rest in'the Ger
man Lutheran cemetery of Princeton
town.
Henry Dalchow was born at Water
town, Carver county, this state, on
September 7, 1861. He grew to man
hood at that place, and came to Prince
ton 35 years ago, where he has since
resided. Mr. Dalchow was twice mar
ried. The year of his arrival here he
took unto himself a wife in the per
son of Miss Emelia Lueck, and five
children, who are living, were born of
the union, viz: Mrs. Wm. Peterson,
Misses Eda, Alma and Lena, and Emil.
Mrs. Dalchowr
answered the Master's
summons 19 years ago, and some time
thereafter Mr. Dalchow was united in
marriage to Mfss Minnie Kutsche.
Seven children were born of the sec
ond marriage and are living, as fol
lows: Esther, William, Otto, Alfred,
Oscar, Evolch and Sophie. The widow,
two brothers and a sister also survive,
viz: John, of Bogus Brook Albert, of
Carver county, and Mrs. Emelia Schil
ling of Hennepin county.
Henry Dalchow was a good
citizen in the full sense of the term.
Although of a quiet disposition he had
a most likeable personality, and none
knew him but to respect him. He en
joyed the confidence and esteem of
those who formed his acquaintance to
a marked degree, and the fact that he
served several terms as member of the
town board of Princeton is an evidence
of the high regard in which he was
held by his neighbors.
That Mr. Dalchow premeditated the
rash act that robbed him of life is
unthinkable. He was undoubtedly
temporarily deprived of his reason
when he placed the muzzle of the rifle
to his temple and fired the fatal shot.
Mrs. Dalchow and children take this
means to extend their heaiifelt thanks
to all who aided them in their time
of sorrow, and they will never forget
the sympathy extended them by nu
merous friends.
Mrs. Henry Jopp.
Mrs. Henry Jopp, a beloved resident
of Princeton town, breathed her last
Friday morning, following an illness
of six months' duration. Cancer was
the cause of death, and everything
known to medical science was resorted
to in an effort to effect a cureall to
no avail.
Funeral services were conducted on
Sunday afternoon, first from the fam
ily residence, and later from the Ger
man Lutheran church in Princeton
town. Rev. A. O. Strauch conducted
the last sad rites, and numerous
friends and relatives braved the in
clement weather to show their esteem
for deceased. Among those from out
of town who attended the ultimate
services were Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Beck
er, Mrs. G. Arnholdt and Mrs. F.
Hamman, Watertown Mrs. G. Bense
man, Elk River Mrs. William Myfert,
and Mrs. Mary Smith, Minneapolis,
and Mrs. Frank Groff, Watkins. In
terment was in the church remetery.
Deceased whose maiden name was
fys.
Agusta Klingbeil, was born in West
Prussia, Germany, on April 5, 1855,
so at the time of her demise was 65
years, one month and 19 days oW. She
came to this country during the year
of 1874, and was married the same
year to Mr. Jopp at Watertown, this
state. Mr. and Mrs. Jopp resided at
Watertown four years, and then came
to Princeton, which place has since
been their home. No children were
born of the union, but they adopted a
boy some 26 years ago, who lives and
esteems the memory of the departed.
Mrs. Jopp was a faithful member
of the German Lutheran church, a con
siderate neighbor and a devoted friend.
Besides a large circle of friends she
leaves to mourn her death an aged
mother, Mrs. Henrietta Rick, a broth
er, William Klingbeil, two sisters, Mrs.
Gottlieb Hoeft and Mrs. August Kuh
rke, and one half brother, Carl Rick,
all of Princeton town.
Mr. Jopp and son, William, take
this means to express their deepest
thanks to those who extended sympa
thy and aid to them during their be
reavement. They are truly apprecia
tive.
Drowns in St. Francis River.
Paul S. Gamroth, a prominent and
popular Foley young man, lost his life
in the St. Francis river Friday after
noon. The drowning occurred near the
farm of Robert Lavigne, nine miles
southeast of Foley. With the ill-fated
young man at the time were Geo. Hall,
Edward Mushel and Hugh McGee of
Foley, and they were" all fishing. Mr.
Gamroth, it seems, was wading in the
stream, when suddenly taken with se
vere cramps. He uttered one cry for
help and sank, never to emerge alive.
Hugh McGee immediately plunged into
the water with the intention of rescu
ing his companion, and was also taken
with cramps, but was brought back
to shore.
The body wTas

recovered at 7:30 in
the evening, about four hours after
the deplorable incident. Drag hooks
were used, and it was found almost
precisely at the spot where he sank.
Mr. Gamroth was 27 years of age,
and had been a resident of Foley for
about eight years-, where he was of
fice manager and bookkeeper of the
Foley Lumber Company. He was well
liked, and at the time of his unex
pected taking away was serving as
village recorder of Foley. Here in
Princeton Mr. Gamroth had several
friends, who learned to know and re
spect him while he was a member of
the Foley ball team, and all expressed
sincere regret upon hearing of his
demise. Two brothers and his moth
er, who resides at North Prairie, sur
vive him.
Proposed School Site Rejected.
The proposition to acquire the six
other lots in the block where the
Princeton high school is located, for a
site for a new building, was over
whelmingly rejected by the voters of
Independent district No. 1, at a special
election held Tuesday afternoon at the
village hall.
A total of 324 votes were cast,
which is not regarded as a heavy vote,
and of these 239 were against acquir
ing the site 83 were favorable to the
proposition, and there were two un
marked ballots.
Messrs. J. J. Skahen and D. A. Mc
Rae, of the school board, acted as
judges of the election, and Ira G.
Stanley was clerk. The polls closed
at 5 o'clock, and the gentlemen com
pleted the count in 15 minutes, which
is rapid work.
The voters of the district have now
rejected two sites, with an overwhelm
ing adverse vote, and it is doubtful if
a site can be agreed upon. Undoubt
edly numerous of those who voted
"no" Tuesday, believe that if another
building is necessary, the north side
of the river is the proper place for it.
Others are opposed to having a new
building at this time, and would vote
against any site submitted to them
for approval or rejection.
Incendiarism Charged.
The Evangelical Association church,
near the W. E. Strike place in Brad
ford, was destroyed by fire on the 12th
inst., and incendiarism is charged. A
reward of $100 has been posted by
Mr. Strike and his son, for informa
tion that will ""result in the arrest and
conviction of the party who set the fire
that burned the church." A person
was seen there a short time on the day
in question, and soon thereafter the
dry grass in that vicinity was burning.
If the fire was deliberately set with
the intention of destroying the house
of worship, it is evidently the work
of some small-souled crank, who has
been at large too long.

A Touching Tribute.
Archdeacon Herman F. Parshall,
rector of St. Peters Episcopal church
at Cass Lake, who departed this life
at his home in that village on the 13th
inst., was a greatly beloved individual.
The entire front page of the current
number of the Cass Lake Times is de
voted to loving tributes to his mem
ory. This is from the pen of the
venerable editor of the Times, ex
Judge Frank Ives:
Never in the long years that we
have left behind have we approached,
the duty of placing before the world
a tribute to a fellow man with such
doubts and with such knowledge of
our inability of doing complete just
ice as in writing the last tribute to
our beloved and god-like friend,
Archdeacon Herman F. Parshall. His
followers, members of the church in
whose services he has devoted his life
have tenderly spoken of his virtues
and his ability, but of his love and
tenderness toward all mankind from
the lowest forms of humanity to the
higher positions of life there can
never be too much said. The "un-
tutored Indians" for whose welfare
he has spent more than ten years of
the best period of his life, not only in
religious instruction but in the com
mon affairs of civilization his work
and devotion to them bear the un
mistakable impress of unselfishness.
"The man with the hoe," a "brother
of the ox" was as dear and called for
his love and respect as readily as the
one with a plethoric purse and a free
hand. With a broad and catholic
conception of the duties of manhood
he labored, not alone as a clergyman
but as a helper to all who were in
need.
Rotten Work in Minneapolis.
Joseph W. Bragdon, the rich Min
neapolis wholesale grocery man who
is accused of debauching several girls
of tender years in that city, was ac
quitted by a jury a couple of weeks
ago as far as one of the girls was
concerned. All of last week, in a simi
lar acusation in which another young
girl figured, he was on trial, and the
case went to the jury Saturday after
noon. The jury was out 47 hours and
failed to agreethere were 11 for
conviction and one for acquittal on
three final ballots. It is understood
that the foreman, Albert F. Bastyr,
was the stubborn juror. It is openly
charged that the jury, and Bastyr in
particular, was tampered with. Bastyr
is charged with contempt of court and
the evidence against him is pretty
convincing.

KELLOGG AT ANOKA.
Hon. Frank B. Kellogg will speak
at the Stadium in Anoka next Satur
day evening, May 27,- at 8 o'clock. If
the weather should prove unfavorable
the meeting will be held in the Armory
or one of the halls. Other speakers
will also be present and speak. A cor
dial invitation is extended to the people
of Princeton and vicinity to be present.
Great Meeting at St. Cloud.
One of the largest and most en
thusiastic political meetings in cen
tral Minnesota for years was held at
Davidson's theater in St. Cloud last
Thursday evening to listen to Frank
B. Kellogg and ex-Congressman Fred
C. Stevens. The spacious building
was packed, scores stood up in the
aisles and passageways and hundreds
more could not gain admission. All
the neighboring towns were well rep
resented. There was six auto loads
from Princeton. The Ladies' band
furnished inspiring music inside the
building, and another band entertained
the, crowds on the streets. Ex-Sena
tor Ripley B. Brower presided.
Mr. Kellogg was. given a great
ovation when introduced by the chair
man, and the telling points in his
masterly address of almost two hours
duration were loudly applauded. He
discussed preparedness, the tariff,
merchant marine and the topics of
national importance in his usual logi
cal and convincing manner. He made
no appeal to racial prejudices and
never once referred to any of Tiis
rivals in an unfriendly manner. His
manly, straightforward talk made him
many new friends.
Mr. Kellogg was followed by Mr.
Stevens who delivered a rattling good
speech. He told of how Mr. Kellogg
had demonstrated on several occa
sions his practical friendship for the
laboring men, and especially referred
to his successful efforts in preventing
a strike on the Great Western system
of railways several years ago, and re
ceived for the employes of the road all
that they had asked for and how the
railroad men showed their gratitude
and appreciation by voluntarily re
questing -Mr. Taft to appoint him to
the supreme bench
All in all
political meetings ever held in the
Granite City. The out-of-town guests,
especially the Princeton contingent,
feel truly grateful for the courtesies
extended by Alvah Eastman, C. F.
Macdonald and the hospitable citizens
of St. Cloud generally.
it was one of the best
More Men Wanted.
The Minnesota National Guard was
recently subjected to a thorough fed
eral inspection, and six companies
h?* been mustered outwiped off the
mapas a result. These companies
were hopelessly deficient. Eighteen
others have been placed on probation,
and unless improvement is noticeable
they will be mustered out also at a
later date.
In this connection it is gratifying
to note that Co. of Princeton is not
included in the list of companies that
failed to measure up to requirements.
Captain Johnson, Lieutenant Morton
and other officers of the company have
labored hard to bring up to an ex
cellent standard, and the local company
is a credit to the village.
Co. has a membership of 64 at
the present time, and, inasmuch as the
full quota allowed in times of peace
is 76, it is now in a position to con
sider favorably 12 applications for
membership. Young menwho desire
to secure military training are invited
to join. Uniforms, guns and ammu
nition are supplied gratis. The Third
regiment, of which Co. is a part,
will be in camp at Lake City from
June 20 to 29, inclusive, and those who
affiliate with the company before that
time will be afforded an opportunity
to participate in the outing. This
makes a splendid vacation tripthere
is just enough exercise to make one
feel fit. Railroad transportation both
ways is provided, and members re
ceive $1.50 per day while in camp.
Ihe boys invariably return with an
appearance of rugged health that is
genuine. Those who contemplate en
listing are urged to do so in the near
future.
Potato Market Advances.
Potato prices advanced sharply the
first of the week, and since that time
Burbanks and Russets have been
bringing from 95c to $1.00 per bushel.
Other varieties have been worth about
70c. Receipts were exceptionally
heavy yesterday, for this season of
the year, and buyers estimate that
more potatoes were marketed that
day than the total receipts of a week
previous. Prices were firm this morn
ing, and the quotations appear else
where.

Next Tuesday, May 30, is Memorial

exclusively by a grateful people to
honoring the survivors and departed
heroes of that memorable conflict that
determined the oneness of this nation.
In all sections of our fair land people
will congregate, and pay a deserved

and living.
Princeton will, as usual, observe the
day with appropriate exercises, and a
committee has completed arrange
ments for an observance fitting the
solemn occasion. The citizens of this
vicinity will assemble at the Armory
where a musical program prepared by
Mrs. H. C. Cooney, will be carried out.
The Memorial day address will be
delivered by Attorney E. L. McMillan,
and Princeton is indeed fortunate in
having a citizen so capable of doing
justice to the subject.
At the present time when the United
States is enjoying peace and plenty,
while all of Europe is engulfed in
war, it is especially meet and proper
that our citizens should honor those
brave men who responded to duty's
call, and endured untold hardships that
the Union of states might continue
one and inseparable.
It is only a matter of a few years
when the last survivor of the war of
the Rebellion will have responded to
the Master's summons, and those who
are still in the land of the living are
entitled to the most considerate treat
ment at all times. So while we honor
the dead, let us also remember the
living.
