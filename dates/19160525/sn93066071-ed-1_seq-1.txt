A great many people who earn less than others have
bank accounts because they aro prudent, saving regularly a
part o'f what fhey earn.
It doesn't take much figuring to see the folly of spending
all you earn, thus robbing yourself of future independence
and happiness.
A bank account is the result of a sand look ahead. We
will help you save. Begin with any amount, however small.

THE NEW CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF
BEAYER.
With the meeting of a group of Bea
ver citizena In the court room last
Thursday evening, assembled in re
sponse to an announcement in the pa
pers of that morning, made by Judge
Loofbourrow, was laid the foundation
for a new era of prosperity and ad
vancement for Beaver. It wasn't a
large crowd some thirty or forty.
Neither was It a boisterous one in
fact quite the contrary to the general
conduct of such gatherings, there was
an attitude or quiet and seriousness
about the entire proceedings that
stamped them with a mark of efficiency
and determination.
Judge Loofbourrow called the meet
ing to order, Hh spoke briefly of the
sudden great advancement of the com
mercial Interests of Beaver; of the
bustling activity in the building line
since the coming of the railroad ; and
of the resultant growth of the city,
carrying with It a growth In the mu
nicipal duties and responsibilities. He
made known the deficiencies of the
municipal light and water plant; the
need of a new engine, of further ex
tensions of the water and light sys
tems, and of the organization of a vol
untary tire department. Then he told
of the nerd of some force to initiate
Improvements along these lines, to
help advertise Beaver's advantages,
and to locale prospeative citizens and
business men. And, finally, he cal'ed
for sugguiaiottg towards the organiza
tion of a commercial club to supply
this utol.
One after another of those represen
tatives of Beaver's solid business inter
ests present at the meeting arose and
expressed their hearty endorsement of
the plan, A temporary organization
was forintd,',nlth Mr. II. R. Barnard
acting as ohalrman and Claude T
Smith acting secretary. The roll of
membership in the permanent organi
zation was then opened, and every
man at the meeting attached his sig
nature, paid his initiation and first
year membership fee of five dollars,
acd the ship of the Kew Chamber. of
Commerce of Beaver was launched
pn ,the pea of its municipal endeavors,
tobe piloted by a Pressdent to be
elected at IU next 'meeting, on Mon
day, May 32nd, and manned by a crew
in which will be enlisted every busi
ness man and citizen of Beaver who
has the welfare of Beaver at heart, and
the development of a bigger and better
city as its goal.
Are we t. have a Commercial Club
in Beaver that will be a success, that
will take the lead n working for need
ed iraproyemenis.'that will prove an
active, vital force in the development
of tho city? Or Is this Chamber of
Commerce of Beaver to follow the list
less way of other tike organizations
previously formed hare, to bud with a
great show of e witislasm, only to din
in a few mouths for wautof active sup
port and encouragement? On you, Mr.
Citizen, and you, Mr. Taxpayer, and
you, Mr, Businessman, on each and ev
ery one of you rests the responsibility
for the ultimate success or failure of
this Commercial Club. The eyes of
all the neighboring little towns will be
on you. Put your shoulder to the
wheel; Join the Club, pay your dues,

INGS. With the hearty, unselfish co
operation of each and every one of you,
