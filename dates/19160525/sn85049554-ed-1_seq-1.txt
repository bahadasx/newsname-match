Mr. Wilson did not disclose any

gained an Impression, however, that
the president would entertain sug
gestions that he extend his good offices
^,.,to belligerents to bring about peace

He pointed out that there are many

gather no impression that a move by

in immediate prospect at least.

the president to'tnvlte other nations to

Close of the war with the object of
setting up a court to settle interna

president he believed this amend
ment made the naval bill an assurance
to foreign nations that the United
States was armed for defense only,
and was ready to enter into any agree
ment to settle International disputes
amicably.
The president did not commit him
self definitely as to the amendment,
but Mr. Hemsley gained the impres

Mr. Hensley left the White House
