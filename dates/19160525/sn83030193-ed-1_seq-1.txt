Leaders to Put End to

Premier Announces Policy Af
ter Casement Is Indicted
for High Treason.
LONDON. May 25. Premier As
quith took the House of Commons by
surprise this afternoon In making his
expected statement on Irish nffHlrs.
He devoted his speech not so much
to the rebellion and tho manner In
which the Government dealt with It,
as It was thought he would do, as
to" making an appeal for settlement of
the Irish problem by ngreement
among the Irish leaders.
In this connection the Premier an
nounced that David Lloyd George.
Minister of Munitions, had under
taken at the request of tho Cabinet
to negotiate between the contending
Irish parties. He nsked that In the
mean time tho matter should not bo
debated in the House.
John Hedmond, Sir Kdwnrd Carson
nnd William O'Brien, tho Irish
leaders, agreed to this nnd notwith
standing an attempt by Laurence
Ginnell, n Nationalist member, to
nnke a speech, the subject was
dropped for the day at least and the
house was emptied qulckl .
Haron Stamfordham, Private Secre
tary to King George, was present and
listened closely to Premier Asqulth'a
speech. Ho departed Immediately
afterward and returned to the palace
to report to the king. Haron Wlm
borne, Ijnrd Lieutenant of Ireland,
also was present.
Premier Asqulth's speech was made
u few hours nfter Sir Hogcr Case
ment and his soldier confederate,
Daniel Halle y. had been Indicted on a
charge of high treason.
Iteferrlng to the sacrifices that Irish
men had made In behalf of the Hrltlsh
Kmplre during the present war, Mr.
Asquith said:
"Could we who represent tlrcnt
llrltaln or could they who represent
1 1 eland tolerate the prospect that when
this war was over and when we had
by our Joint efforts and sacrifices, as
we had hoped und believed we would,
achieved our end, here at homo Irish
men would bo arrayed against one an
another In the most tragic and most
debasing of all conflicts internecine
domestic strife."
"I say to tho House of Commons
to the country and to tho Kmplre
that the thought Is Inconceivable. It
can never be, for It would mean con
fession of bankruptcy, not only of
statesmanship but of patriotism."
Itcfeirlng to tho Home ltulo Hill,
Mr. Asquith said: "No one, so far a.s
I know, has ever desired or conteni
plated its coerclvo application by ono
set of Irishmen against another,
What Is now in this groat and do
mestlc emergency of paramount im
portance is that If It be posslblo and
I hone It Is possible an agreement
such as wo thought In vain before
the war should bo arrived at between
those representing different Interests
and parties In Ireland.'
For tha tlmo being tho composition
of the Irish Kxecutlve must bo pro-
visional, Mr. Asqultli said. Mo
feared that debate at this moment
might creatu an atmosphere unfav
orable to tho appeal he nnd his cul
leagues unanimously folt It was tnelr
duty to make.

Brother to Admit Money
Troubles With Employer.
Dr. Arthur Warren Walto was
eagerly waiting to bo called to the
witness stand In his own defense
when his trial for the murder by
poison of John K. Peck, his wealthy
father-in-law, was resumed this af
ternoon. He frequently asked his
lawyers whether they were not boon
o call him, and seemed perfectly
confident. He wishes to convince the
Jury of the reasonableness nnd sin
cerity of his belief that Inasmuch ns
hu "couldn't seo nnythlng wrong" In
killing his wife's parents, hnlf of
whose nillllon-dollnr estate she was
to Inherit, ho therefore had not been
guilty of a crime.
All morning ho listened while his
counsel argued his "unwell condition
of mind" from childhood and drew
from his father and brothers state
ments on which lo base these con
clusions. Dr. Walto lit aril his ro
kit Ives describe him as n bad boy
and dishonest youth, generous in his
later years with other people's money.
Evidence of Insanity In collateral
branches of the family was put nn
tho record for discussion later In tho
case by alienists.
The defense opened with un ad
dress by Attorney Deuel lasting less
than ten minutes. Ho declared ho
would prove Walte was In an "un
well mental condition."
Frank Walte, nn assistant In the
New York Public Library, nine years
older than his brother, was the llrst
witness called.
Hoth In his manner and voice, as
well as in t!:u lines of his face, Frank
Walto showed the effect of the strain
under which bo has rested.
Q. What is our tlrst recollection
of tho defendant? A. As nn Infant,
Q. What were his peculiarities ns a
child'.' A. Well, ho had a very largo
face head.
Justice Shearn What has that to
do with the case?
Mr. Deuel If the peculiarity
caused hliu to bo ridiculed, your
Shearn Oh, that Is another
matter; proceed.
Q, When ho began going to school,
at tho age of from six to nlno years,
what was his disposition? A. Ho
required a great deal of attention. He
was backward. Alwajs a laggard.
Q. In his studies? A. Yen, und about

to Ann Arbor for a threo-your course
of dentistry nt tho University of

complete It.

To Counsel Frank Moss, who ex

Dunn was born In New York nnd has

denning his duties Mgr. Dunn said
ho receives reports from ull the char
itable Institutions of tho Catholio

Mgr. Dunn real a statement begin
ning: "It Is amusing to rend tho state
ment of the Mayor in which he sitcaks
of his 'co. religionists.' One would
think that he had been Incorrectly

The statement declared that Mayor
Mitchel was laboring to take religion
out of the hewts of the 23,000 chil

this city.
One part of the statoment reads
"The only consp'rncy thus far un
covered Is the ono In which he figured
so prominently, and In whose Inter
ests he labored so untiringly and law.
lessly. He has attacked ruthlessly the
work of our Sisterhoods and dragged
the dead from tho grave in his ber
serker rago In an attempt to Justify
his Ignoble conduct.
"Some time later when he welrhi
his Intemperate language and con
siders the odium he has brought on
this community by his conduct, ho
will no doubt regret his ill-advised
effort to bonmlrch the abracters of
unselfish men and women who hava
contributed to the care of the unfor

motives may have Inspired his noble
purpose and violent attack on tha
