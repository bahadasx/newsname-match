Federation Attends Meeting of
tlie Prohibition Forces
Archie Gregory, secretary of the
Box nutte County Dry Federation,
returned Saturday noon from Lin
coln, where he attended a meeting of
prohibition workers from all over
the state. Early Friday afternoon,
the delegation of about two- hundred
and fifty men and women, met at the
Llndell hotel, and marched to the
State house with the intention of til
ing the referendum petition with ov
er 67,000 signatures, asking for the
prohibition question to be submitted
to the people at the general election
next fall. It is a lega lrequ.rement
that such petitions be filed with the
Secretary of State in the presence of
the governor; but the governor was
absent, and the petition was brought
away, to be filed at a later date.
At the banquet in me evening, sev-
eral prominent Aeorasxans spoae. i
giving many valuable suggestions ,
relative to the carrying on of the
campaign for a "dry" Nebraska. The
general opinion was that the feeling
of confidence in victory, which pre
vails throughout the Ftale, is, at
present, the greatest enemy to the
cause.
PROMISES FINE CONCERT
lto Sure to be at City Park No inlay
Afternoon and Enjoy Concert
(iven by Alliance Hand
Members of the Alliance band will
give their first Sunday afternoon
concert at the city park beginning
next Sunday. May 28, and will con
tinue giving concerts every Sunday
afternoon at 4 p. m. This organiza
tion has worked faithfully practicing
during the entire winter, and they
have a large repertoire of music
ready andwill give the public some
thing new" every concert. Alliance
at present has by far the best band
in northwest Nebraska, so come out
and show that you appreciate their
efforts. The new double Bb bass
whf tre Commercial Club purchas
ed for the band will probably be In
use. This la the largest instrument
of Its kind manufactured.
We think it hardly necessary to
state that every citUen of Alliance
owes apreciatlon to the leader of the
band, and its members, and should
endeavor to attend this function in
the open air. Surely these hard
working boys should have and be
made to feel that the people of Alli
ance are back of them; as it is easy
to ask them to get back of any uala
day atTalr and to furnish music, so
there should be a hearty response to
whatever the Alliance Band wishes
to promote.

CROOKS HURRY WEST
Box Butte County Young Man Proven
Himself too Wle to He Taken
In on a "Con" (Same
"Doc" White, an "English Jew."
and Fred Harris, an American, both
of many aliases and members of the
slick fingered fraternity, hearing that
Alliance was a good, live town (and
they were right .about that part of
it), arrived on a Wednesday morn
ing train and shortly afterwards pro
ceeded with their pre-arranged pro
gram. As the men afterward confessed,
before they took the train for the
far west," they met one. sucker with
three dollars," another with four dol
lars and finally one, who proved to
be too wise for them, with seven dol
lars. This was rather discouraging,
for they had planned on getting
away with a good sized roll, having
heard perhaps of the time that "the
Dutchman" lont his roll of 210 in
the much famed and widely known
Atlas rooming house.
The young man with the seven
dolalr roll was from the country, liv
ing in the western part of Box Butte
county, but he had traveled some
and had worked for Alliance business
institutions, and had become some
wise to the ways of the world.
When Harris, who was the "comm
on" man, got acquainted with the
Box Butte Wise Boy, he asked to be
shown around the town. While be
ing shown around he confided to the
W. B. that he knew a. game which
would make them both money that
of ,natcllng dollars and always turn
ht,Hr1f, Th W. B. from Box
Buttt Ma8 rather 8USpj0ioua but he
pnended to fall in with Harris.
ShoMly afterwards, lo ani behold
who (1d they meet but White, dress
ed as an English sport and with
money to blow. White of course at
this time was a total stranger (?) to
Hani but In the way of "men of th
wurrld" they readily became ac
quainted and after a little urging
White said he would be glad to
match dollars with Harris and the
W. B. Trom Box Butte. And so the
dollar matching began. And the
trick worked as Harris had told the
W. B. that it would work he, the
W. B., won two dollars from the
Henglishman. But here the W. B.
remembered that he had an import
ant engagement and begged leave to
slip away much to the disappoint
ment of the twain. The W. B. hunt
ed up the police and told the story
the police hunted up the pair and
landed Harris In the dragnet. White
was wife and started on the trail of
an attorney
The Herald reporter. Ln his usual
nightly wanderings, happened into
the police station and (at bis request
this time) was locked up with Har
ris on the charge of being a gambler
meaning, we suppose, that the
newspaper game is a gamble
Harris, who had been rather down
hearted, perked up a little on finding
himself with a companion In misery,
and the two told their stories to each
other. If space would permit, the
stories told would make interesting
reading. It will suffice to say that
your reporter told of a life which
made him blush and which certainly
excited the admiration of Harris.
The conversation, among other
things, included thusly: Harris.
"Know Tom Dennison down In Oma
ha? He's some crook, ain't he?" Re
porter, "He sure Is. but he's all
right, he got me out of trouble down
there several times." And so op, ad
libeluni. ad infinitum. '
In the meantime White had again
changed attire and came to the po
lice station with an attorney, who
succeeded ln getting a hearing for
the boys, who were fined and releas
ed, on their promise to "kiss Alli
ance farewell forever and ever." The
attorney offered to lend the reporter
the money he received for his fee to
pay the reporter's fine, but the Judge
1. I .1 J .r.l sw I ho i-airk"'
was kind and released the rep
with an adinoinitlon to go and sin
HO .
And o, dear reader, you must con
tern yourself with knowing that
White and Harris have gone west,
leaving the city of Alliance a portion
of their earnings (?) garnered else
where, and that their opinion of this
being a live town has changed since
the W. B. from Box Butte gave away
their little game to the police. If
vou wish to know more, "ask Wil
liam Wheeler." as the girl in the
vaudeville rketch remarked at the
Imperial the other evening.

CITY OPENS A
DEEP NEW WELL
Four Municipal Wells Now Pumping

for City CoiiNiiiiiption
COUNCIL MAKES CHANOE
IN THE MILK OHD1NANCE
Bids Will He Asked for New Monster
Power Pump for Use at Power
House with Itoservoir
If anyone in the city of Alliance
(omitting from consideration of
course newspapermen) earns his
salary it is the mayor and each mem
ber of the city council. With five
meetings this month already, and
more to come, the council and mayor
are attending to business pretty
steadily.
At the special meeting held Wed
nesday evening at the city hall coun
cil chamber there were present the
mayor, clerk and Councilmen David
son, Welch, Davis. Moore, Was, Help-
bringer and Kibble.
Grading was ordered done on East
Seventh street, so that sidewalks in
that vicinity could be laid. Bids will
be advertised for. A new street
drag, to cost not over 150, will be
purchased for Street Commissioner
John Carlson. The city farm has
been leased to Fred Helling for $100,
he agreeing to care for the surplus
water from the septic tank. Seven
acres more will be sowed to alfalfa
by the city, giving a total of twenty-
nve acres of alfalfa on the farm, f
The council will sit as a board of
equalization at the next regular
meeting, June 13. A meeting of the
city tax commission, in conjunction
with the council, will be held Friday
evening at the city hall.
The mayor stated that investiga
tion has shown that the surveying
done at the cemetery ln previous
years was incorrect and that If the
proper lines were drawn a number of
graves would have to be moved. It
is doubtful if any changes will be
made, other than to have future lots
sold to conform with the proper sur
veys.
City Light Plant Superintendent
Hughes was instructed to advertise
for bids for a hixh duty pressure
pump, to be used In connection with
the new reservoir, now being con
structed. The pump will probably
cost between $4,000 and 10.000. The
standpipe, which was .built many
years ago, is getting to be-rather an"
unsafe proposition and will have to
be torn' down probably at an early
date. The new reservoir, with a ca
pacity of 500,000 galolns, will make
i he standpipe unnecessary.
Mr. Hughes reported that city well
number four was opened and put In
to use at 5 o'clock Wednesday after
noon. The city is now pumping .
about 300.000 gallons of water daily
for consumption. j
The mayor announced that three
new members will be appointed on
the library board to fill expiring
terms, and a new park board will be
appointed at the next regular meet
ing. After much discussion, it was de
cided to revise the milk ordinance as
published in The Herald this week,
eliminating paragraph twenty-two.
Otherwise the ordinance remains the
same and will be placed on the city
records as published, with the excep
tion of Ibis one paragraph.

LOOKING FOR AUTO THIEF
ICarl M. Montague, Who Sklpited
County leaving $IOO Cash Bond,
Believed Headed This Way
A telegram received by the local
officers Tuesday of this week request
ed them to be on the lookout for
Earl M. Montague, who was ln Den
ver under an alias, and is believed to
be the parly who left Denver at 9
o'clock Monday morning with a Ford
roadster belonging to the Goodyear
Rubber Tire Company.
The Ford roadster is a 1916 model,
black body and wood color wheels,
with license number 8792, with the

The weather for commencement
week of the Alliance high school
seems to have been "made to order"
for the seniors and everyone inter
ested ln the events of the week. As
the days pass rapidly we think we
spy a tear in the eyes of those who
are leaving the happy school days
behind them, to enter the broader
field of endeavor. However, the
pleasures of the week have been
many and enjoyable to those partic
ipating. On last Thursday, May 18. the
Seniors enjoyed their annual class
day in the open, taking a trip by au
tomobiles to Dunlap bridge, thd
members being accompanied by their
class sponsor, Miss Canfield. The
day was filled with much amusement,
and the "eats" were no unpopular
feature of the hours, the return to
Alliance being made by moonlight.
On Sunday evening, the bacca
laureate service was held in the Phe
lan opera house, and the program
contained many fine musical num
bers. Dean William Carson Shaw
delivered a sermon in itself a tribute
to the happy school days of youth,
and with kind words of encourage
ment to the graduates. The hall
was crowded to its fullest seating ca
pacity. Monday of this week was Dcmos
thenlan Day at the high school, and
Senior Recognition Day was observ
ed Tuesday, this latter event being
first staged by the class of this year.
The Seniors wore their caps and
gowns all through the day's pro
gram, and the exercises at the morn
ing chapel were fitting to the occas
ion. Last evening the annual class day
program was carried out at the high,
school building and admitted: only
those who had invitaltnos. The class
of '16 presented the school with a
fine Victrola at this time, and the
class prophesy, poem and history
were among the pleasing features ot
the evening.
The annual alumni banquet will
be held at the Alliance hotel this ev
ening, and the Seniors will be honor
guests. A number" of toasts will be
given, music being furnished by Paul
and Carl Thomas and Miss Battle
RenBwold. The toast master for the
occasion is Attorney Lee Basye. i
Friday evening the graduating ex
ercises will be held at the Phelan .
opera house, and anyone can secure
tickets for this occasion without
charge at Holsten's. A musical pro
gram has ben ararnged for, and is
jsure to delight the audience. The
