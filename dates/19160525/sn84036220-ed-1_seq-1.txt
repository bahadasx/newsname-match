French Writer Points Out How the
Allies Can Win the War.
PARIS, May 24.—The Germans have
reoccupied Fort Douaumont, while the
French hold the immediate approach
to that positon. This announcement
is made in the official communication,
issued by the French war office to
night, which says two new divisions
of Bavarians effected the recapture
after a series of furious atacks.
HOW ALLIES CAN WIN.
PARIS, May 24.—The success of the
offensive undertaken by General Nl
velle, the commander at Verdun, and
the results attained have sent a wave
of encouragement throughout the en
tire country. The Germans are said
to have thrown in all possible re
serves to restore the balance.
French officers say the German
crown prince has been using 80,000
men in his efforts to swamp the
French positions east and west of
Deadman's Hill and to gain decisive
advantages between that point and
Hill 304. Thus far these efforts have
accomplished little.
The great advantage of the success
obtained by the French in the Douau
mont region lies in the fact that this
district is the highest in the vicinity
and therefore permits permanent ar
tillery observation, which Is far su
perior to that of aeroplanes or bal
loons. The French will now be able
to hold the German positions under
observation, and it is expected the
French artillery will soon gain the pre
ponderance.
Deputy Andre Tardleu, foreign edi
tor of the Temps, writes that the
French offensive thus far has been
carried out over a front of less than
25 miles and that it has failed invari
ably since the defenders haVe had time
to bring up reserves.
The opinion Is expressed by M. Tar
dieu that in order for the entente al
lies to conduct a successful offensive
it will be necessary to carry it on si
multaneously over all their fronts. At
present the allies have not sufficient
material to do this, although they pos
sess means of producing that material.
Hence, the proper policy, he writes, is
to continue on the defensive for the
present, the material now available be
ing sufficient to wear down the man
power of their opponents. When the
war material of the allies exceeds that
of tile Germans, as their forces of men
now do, the victory, M. Tardieu con
cludes, will be virtually a mathemat
ical certainty.

NEW YORK, May 24.—An appeal !
to tlie press to keep the stay at-home
woman of the country informed of the
activities of the thirteenth biennial
convention of the General Federation
of Women's Clubs, in session here,
was made by Mrs. Percy V. Penny->
backer of Austin, Texas, president of 1
the organization, in her response to
night to an address of welcome to the
attending delegates, representing the j
48 states and Alaska and the District •
of Columbia
"This convention is held not alone
for the women who have traveled
thousands of miles to attend," Mrs.
Pennybacker said, "but scattered over
this land, on farm, in mountain liatn
let, in mining camp, in prairie village,
in crowded city streets, there are two
million women and, God be thanked,
hundreds of men as well, who will
read eagerly eacli word that comes
from this assemblage.
"Then will yon not, men and women
journalists .translate the soul, the
spirit, of these sessions so that our
stay-at-homes may feel that they are
kept in touch with the best in our
program? We owe much to the press
but we feet that by asking more, and
by deserving more, we shall be placed
under the still greater obligation.
"One of your leading men recently
asked: 'What class of women make
up your organization?' You will find
among us women from every rank of
life, women ranking from this eve
ning's honor guest, the daughter of
tlie president of the United States,
and from the wives of the cabinet, to
women who bravely toil at so-called
menial tasks.
"We have among us the rich and
the poor, the learned and the un
learned, tlie progressive and the con
servative. The true club woman never
boasts of wealth, nor apologizes for
poverty; is never vain of knowledge,
nor humiliated by honest ignorance;
never rasli in her progressiveness, nor
selfish in her conservatism."
Mrs. Pennybacker extended a spe
cial Invitation to men to attend con
vention meetings. "We hesitate not
to say," she declared, "that if the
federation has accomplished anything
during the past 27 years it has been
done through the help of our hus
bands, our fathers, our sons, our
brothers."
Nine thousand delegates, alternates
and visitors from all the states in tlie
Union and from Cuba, Porto Rico,
Alaska and tlie Philippines, attended
here tonight the first general session
of the Thirteenth biennial convention
of the General Federation of Women's
clubs. More than 2.000 spectators
were turned away. Of those in the
armory, where the convention met,

roborated by Mr. d'Autremont, who
ordered Mrs. McDonald out of the

Mrs. d'Autreniont was very positive
in her statements ns to the language
used by the defendant on the occa
sion in question. Tlie plaintiff under
took to show tiiat the statement had
done some actual damage by calling
Justice John Ferns, but it dev«'oped
that whatever was said, liI k judgment
had not been affected by it.
Mrs. Margaret McDonald, the de
fondant, was the first witness for the
defense. She said she went to the
d'Autremont store on tlie occasion in
question to mail a letter and as she
was coming out Mrs. d'Autremont
entered, whereupon the witness says
she told the plaintiff tiiat on the occa
sion of the picnic and dance at l.e
high Mrs. d'Autremont had conic home
with Mr. McDonald in the McDonald
car while the defendant had to hire
a car and she ' anted her to stay out

then went on to relate that Mrs.
d'Autremont called her three kinds
of a liar and other things and finally
advanced upon her with her fist
clenched. She denied site had used
the words specified in the complain'
and said she did not then nor now
suspect that there was anything Im
proper between Mrs. d'Autremont and
McDonald. She got angry when Hi"
plaintiff called her the names and
said she would "break McDonald ' and
"put him behind the liars."
Jennie Greer, who was employed by
Mrs. McDonald at the latter's hotel,
and who accompanied her to the
d'Autremont store on July 21, cor
roborated the defendant as to tlie
quarrel at the store. Her examination
in chief was difficult ami the cross
examination almost impossible, the

Joseph Dunsm.ire testified to seeing
