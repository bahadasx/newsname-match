The Washington IParish Fair t
Association wet per adjournment
from May 6, 1916. Upon roll
call the following were present:,
J. B. Lindsley, F. B. Bateman. t
D. E. Sheridan, W. J. Alford and
J.J. Green, proxies to W. J. i
Dobson, a quorum being present, i
in the absence of the Chairman, ,
J. B. Lindsley was called to the E
chair, stated the object of the I
meeting was to decide where the 1
Fair'should be held this year,
and also stated.that while Boga- i
lusa'would'be glad to have the 1
Fair, that they did not want to i
engender any feeling-in the mat
ter. Hon. P, B. Carter stated
that he had been" requested by
the citizens of Franklinton, and
the immediate vicinity to state to
the Fair Association, that in I
view of the fact that Franklinton i
was at present the center of the 1
Agricultural interests of the Par- c
ish that they did not think it ad- E
visable to change this year, that
while they entertained no preju I
dice against the sister city, the t
farming interest at present situa- f
ted in the Parish would be far t
from the city of Bogalusa, and
that the attendance and exhibits
of farm products from this sec
tion would not be up to the stand
ard of the past two years. The t
secretary read a letter from Mr.
W. H. Sullivan, which letter was
ordered spread on the minutes, 1
and the thanks of the association
was extended to Mr. Sullivan, not
only for his willingness to help
make the Fair a success, but for
numerous and valuable assistance
in the past.
Bogalusa, La., May 18.
Mr. W. J. Dobson, Secretary,
Franklinton, La.
Dear Sir:
It is just possible that'I
may not be able to attend the
meeting ofsthe directors on the
20th. I asked Mr. Johnson to at
tend'the last meeting and act for
me anId to suggest that you hold
the Fair at 3egalusa.
Personally I do not feel like
making any contest for it, but
any time the people of Franklin
tonl and the other directors are
willing to give it up and co-oper
ate with nu, we will be glad to
have it held in Bogalusa, and
will do what we can to make it
successful. In the meantime, if
you desire to have it continue at
Franklinton, we are willing to do
what we can to help. The Fair
is a very important thing in the
life of the Parish and will result
in a very great benefit to every
one.
Yours very truly,
W. II. Sullivan,
Motion made, seconded and
carried. that the Fair for the year
1916 be held in Franklinton, La.,
and that the chairmnian be and
hereby is empowered to fix the

There being no further busi
