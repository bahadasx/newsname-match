Hunley and Miss Stella Mims

to get busy, organize and make
plans.

High School Closes;
Splendid Exercises
The closing exercises of the
Chesterfield High School were
highly gratifying.
The recital on Friday evening
given hy Miss Brock's violin
class was a genuine surprise to
a large number of her audience.
This is the first; term that violin
music has been taught here, and
that the teacher in less than
seven months was able to give
a first-class musical entertainment
was thought to be wonderful.
The little folks were enchored
until they were tired
playing.
The commencement sermon
was preached on Sunday evening
at St. Paul Methodist Church
by the Rev. J. M. Forbes, of Bethune.
There was a large con
gregation to hfar this excellent
sermon.
On Monday evening H. M.
Miller, e6q., delivered the bacca
laureate address to a crowded
house. Mr. Miller is a finished
orator and was at his best on
thi3 occassion.
Hon. G. K. Laney, in presenting
the diplomas, called attention
to the fact that this is the
only high school in the county
whose diploma is accepted by all
of che colleges as sullicient evidence
for entrance without examination.
On Tuesday evening the music
class of Miss Mattie Gaddy entertained.
Miss Gaddy has the
largest class in piano music that
Chesterfield has ever had and
they gave a good account of
themselves on this occason. A
very gratifying entertainment
was given.
The ladies of the Presbyterian
Ladies' Aid Society served ice
cream at the close of the recital.

sold 1,100 bales of cotton on

Banks Are Aiding
Boys of Florence
Florence?L. L. Baker, State
agent of the work among the
boys, was here and wont over j
the field with Ward McLendon,
county agent. lie expressed 1
himself as delighted with the
work. There are about 100 boys '
in the county now engaged in 1
the work, divided between the 1
pig and the corn clubs. Tney
are doug excellent work. The '
boys get either registered hogs *
or common for their work in the c
clubs, and there are half a hun- c
dred fine Duroc and Berkshire t
hogs in the county now, and ev- *
ery boy who has applied for aid *
in securing a brood sow has been c
helped if he had the sanction of
his father in going into the ar- 1
rangment. The City Savings ?
bank here has undertaken that 0
work and has met every demand. ^
Many of these hogs have been C
bought in this county, where 11
some of the finest bred hogs in e
the country are to be had.
Mr. Baker while here had a ^
conference with the City Savings .
bank officials and they suggested
having all the pig club boys here ^
one day as the guest of the bank.
Mr. Baker and others of the department
will be here to lecture
to them on some practical and j.
interesting phase of hog raising
or marketing. Ci
Mr. Baker says that he has ^
now about 2,500 boys in the
State in this work, and that he nt
has had the most generous and y
and cordial cooperation of the ^
school authorities and the banks j
and business people. The returns
have shown that the work has ^
been of great practial value to
the State and is going to be of .
more value by a good deal this
year, he believes, than ever before.

Stage Tramp And His Jokes 0
Nat Wills, the tramp coraedi- r
an, now performing at the New
York Liippodrome, who arouses
the public's risibles by reading t]
his famous improvised telegrams
from notables of the world, has 11
added more to his long list.
OnA frnm Mrs l'ntik hnraf cmro P
"It, as Kudyard Kipling says, g
woman is only a rag, a bone and "
a bank of hair, then let me tell *
you what man is, nothing but
a jag, a drone and a tank of air." (
One from the German atnbassador,
Count Von Bernstorff,
reads: "Cancel order for toys as '
my 'Boy-Ed' is going back to w
Europe." n
"Teddy Roosevelt wires me," ^
reads Wills, "that he is ready to ?

No Filth?No Flies! f
Flies and filth go together. No filth, ,
no files! About the only good thing
you can say about the fly is that his 1
presence should stimulate you to hunt 1
op the place whore he was born and ^
destroy it so that it may breed no
more of his kind. *
Fly swatting may be a popular pas- f
time. It has been talked about much.
So far, it has proved ineffective. The
well-meaning person, applying the
swatter at every opportunity, kills one
fly at a time. The removal of the contents
of a single manuro box will swat
millions of thorn at a blow.
Screens and swatters are a good
thing, but a clean neighborhood is the j
best. Get busy!

people here to day, declared liV I
lioped the United States, afteBI

The President expressed the I'
lope that out of the European 1
var may come an amalgamation ^
)f the peoples and the interests
>f the world which will bring
hem into a common melting pot.
le ventured the hone that, af^rr
he present war all people might
ome together.
The president, here for the
41st anniversary of the sighning
f the Mecklenburg Declaration
f Independence, was introduced
>y Governor Craig, of North
Carolina, who spoke of the presJent
as one of the greatest leadrs
the nation ha-; ever seen.
There were many from Chesertield

Aero Mail Service
taltimore America.
The postoflice department reently
invited bids for carrying
be mail over eight proposed
erial routes. Seven of these
^ntemplated routes are in Alasa
and one is between a coastal
ity of Massachusetts and an ismd
that lies oil' the coast. For
?ven of these proposed aerial
mil lines there were no bids.
nd only ons bid for the service
etween Seward, the southern
ort of Alaska, and Iditarod,
hich is iibO miles inland. There
re several quite apparent reuses
why there has been no gt&nd
iish to secure these air lineconracts.
For one thing, the comparaively
few concerns in this county
which are engaged in the
lanufacture of aeroplanes and
hich ordinarily might he exected
to be concerned in
overnment contracts for airline
tail service, are loaded up
ith orders for producing miliary
n.achines. In addition to
vreign orders it seems that the
Inited States goverinent has
ecently placed large contracis
:ir aeroplanes. This txplains
diy there is a lank of available
machines for mail route servict?,
Lnother reason for tlie absence
f bids on the proposed air lines
s the scarcity of trained aviutrs.
In time, perhaps by ti e <hul
f another year, we shall have
he machines for the service, the
rained air pilots and then the
,ir line mail routes- In l'hilalolpha
last week a school of avi
,tion was formally opened with
to enrolled students. There
hould he such a school in every
arge city. The danger element
n aeroplane Might lias been
greatly lessened during the last.
!0 months, and though aeronauts
are not likely to be as
numerous as automobile chaufeur-?
for some time, yet the air
raftsmen will gradually multi)ly.
It is a very highly paid
lervice.
