What To Do June 7th
June 7th is Commencement at Bereal
There will be 2,000 people in the fjreat Tabernacle,
and twice as many more under the preat trees of the cam-
Eus, moving about to see the Library, Chapel Tower,
ireside Industries, Farm Machinery, and Industrial
Exhidits.
The "show" begins at 8:10 with the grand procession
from Ladies Hall to the Tabernacle. All the forenoon
the student exercises go forward in the Tabernacle.
First, the Vocational students with exhibitions of
farm work, carpentry, women's work and the like.
Then the Normal students, telling what we should
do for our children and the public schools.
And then the College students with speeches about
politics, science, religion, and the progress of the world.
At the end of each hour a cannon is fired and a piece
of music brought on, and those who are tired sitting in
the Tabernacle pass out while others waiting at the doors
pass in.
The great hour is at 12 o'clock when the actual grad
uation takes place. The prize Bibles are distributed and
the graduating classes, one after another, march upon
the platform to receive their diplomas and degrees.
At that hour everyone who can possibly find stand
ing room in the Tabernacle should be there.
Then there is a lunch on the grass and at half-past one
the Tabernacle is filled again to hear speeches from dis
tinguished men. Dr. Bodie will be there from Kansas,
and Dr. Goss, the famous optimist, from Cincinnati.
The thing to do June 7th is to come to Commencement!

BRING FOUR PRISONERS
Two American Troopers Are Fired
Upon by Mexicans While Swimming
In the Rle Grande No Defection
Among Csrranxa Soldiers.
El Psso, Tex., May 23. Having
completed their work In Mexico, the
troops comprising the second Ameri
can punitive expedition sent Into
Mexico, are now back on Texas soil,
the last of the . command having re
crossed the Rio Grande at Boquillas.
According to Colonel Sibley, who
commands tbe expedition, the Ameri
can forces chased the bandits over
120 miles Into Mexico, rescued Jesse
Deemer and two employes who had
been carried prisoners into Mexico,
and scattered the bandits until furth
er successful pursuit was Impossible.
Troops of both Coloney Sibley and
Major George T. Lengborne are bow
at Boquillas, according to a dispatch
received here. Colonel Sibley brought
with him to this side four Mexican
prisoners, who were captured by
Lieutenant Crammer in a running
fight near San Anita, Coachuila, ten
days ago. There were two other
prisoners, captured at the same time,
but these had been so badly wounded
In the fight that they were left at El
Pino by Major Langborne. It was be
lieved they will die.
According to arrivals from Boquil
las there Is no truth In the report
that the expedition had been menaced
byYaqui Indians.
The report emanated from a mes
sage sent by the war department to
Colonel Sibley several days ago, ad
rising him that a band of Taqul In
dians had left Cautro Ciengas for Bo
quillas on the Mexican side. Tbe re
port originated with a man wbe came
out of Mexico at Eagle pass and made
the declaration that the Indians were
headed north for the Sibley column,
bent upon driving It out of Mexico.
In Juares It la asserted officially that
there are no Taqul troops la eastern
Mexico.
Confirmation was received here of
a report that two United States
troopers, while swimming In the Rio
Grande, near Deemer's ford, were
Bred at Ave times from the Mexican
side. The soldiers, neither wounded.
scrambled for their rifles to return
the Are, but the puffs of smoke which
had marked the Mexican's place of
concealment had drifted away.
Investigation of the reported de
fection of two Carranxa generals
south of Juares disproved the story.
General Gabriel Gavlra, of the Juares
garrison, said:
"The weak point in tbe story to
tho effect that Generals Castro and
Chaves, alleged subofllcers of Gen.
Jacinto Tre-vino had revolted. Is that
there are no such officers in General
Trovtno's command."

Washington, May 23. The state
ment of Premier Brland of Franc
that "peace must not result from dip

Germany to enlist Ue sympathies of
President Wilson toward a move for

Is Intiiguee." which will aot be al
lowed to affect the entente allies la

Late reports state that the Ital

by the Austrian, having been driv

since the beginning of the offensive
the Austrians have taken more than
