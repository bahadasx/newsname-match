R. M. WHITE & SON, Editor, and Prop.
BILLY SUNDAY'S 10 COMMANDMENTS
Billy Sunday is specific, always. The follow
ing "ten commandments," which he has compiled,
he belienes are modern, unmistakable directwns
for right living:
I- THOU SHALT NOT GOSSIP.
There are three ways to spread the news telephone telegraph
and tell a woman. The devil is so afraid of some of you women
he wouldn't get within twenty feet of you.
II THOU SHALT NOT COVET
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's cook nor his automobile,
nor his rubber tired carriage, nor his private yacht. Many a
man would like to have his neighbor's wife.' You let her alone.
HI THOU SHALT NOT TANGO
I'm against the rotten licentious hell-begotten dance that
seada more girls to hell than anything else I'm in favor of
very thing that the devil is against, and I'm against everything-
the dovil is in favor of
IV THOU SHALT NOT BE STINGT
Some would-be Christians are so stingy that they would steal
flies from blind spider . There are others so mean that
they aing through their noses to save wear and tear on their
false teeth .
V THOU SHALT NOT HAVE TOO MANY BEAUX .
It's hard to fool a real suitor and a man doesn't want to marry
a girl that's been pawed over by every young buck in the
community, The frizzle-headed girl that sits up in a daik
parlor until all hours of the morning with one buck after
another is on the way to perdition.
VI THOU SHALT NOT BE CONCEITED
A conceited man is like a cheap-skate restaurant where every
thing is in the window and nothing on the table but hot air.
Self-conceit will always be a millstone around your neck.
VII THOU SHALT NOT DRINK
The man who says he can drink or let it alone lies. No man
ever intended to become a drunkard. Every drunkard started
out to be simply a moderate drinker. If you believe you can
leave it alone, why don't you?
VIII THOU SHALT NOT CUSS.
One of the things that show the foundation of a man's char
acter to be rotten is to hear him cubs and vomit out oaths. I
would not trust a profne man any too far in any transaction
IX THOU SHALT NOT DODGE THY DEBTS
Some haven't religion enough to pay their debts. Would
that I might have a hook, and for every debt that you left
unpaid I might jerk off a piece of clothing! If I did, some of
you would be left with only a celluloid collar and a pair of
socks.
X THOU SHALT NOT FLIRT.
Society takes no note of the flirtation on the street. It waits
until the girl has lost her virtue and then slams the door in
her face. I wish I could make a girl who flirts see herself ns
others see her. If you make eyes at a man on the street he
will pay you back.

ORGANIZED CHARITY
FOR MEXICO
4llr Ledirtii U rla.l n Lnnw that.
federated Clubs of Mexico arc
proposition in earnest. This has
tma -enterprise of the Ledger
for years, and when It was first under
taken the troublo grew out of the fact
that "it cost so much money to hire
someone to look after the worthy
poor in the organized way." For the
last two or three years the fund rais
ed by the Ledger has been handled
an organized way by representa
tives of all the churcnes, ana wiy
Clerk Dearing without any charge in
vestigated all who applied. In this
way the services was rendered in a
most efficient way, but not in as
broad a way as can be done by the
Federated Clubs of Mexico in connec
tion with a trained nurse.
In addition to the cost of handling
the fund, we had to contend with
those who wanted to expoit themsel
ves, while others denaca we iaea oi
organized charity, and wanted their
donations to be spent spasmodically,
and the first come was the first serv
ed; while quite a number of chronic
deadbeats were getting money from
thj city,, and from a lodge or two,
and'most of the churches. ' We are of
the opinion now that most of our
people have come to the conclusion
that, we must have, organization and
efficiency in charity the same as in
any other proposition and in this way
the deadbeats can be driven out of
town or made to go to work.
In this connection, we want to call
attention to a letter published in to
day's Ledger from Columbia, Mo.,
which shows clearly that organized
charity in connection with a trained
nurse in that city is proofing most
successful. We feet satisfied that the
subscriptions toward charity in the
future will be much more liberal than
in the past, and that all will co-op
erate with the Federated Uuds in
seeing that no worthy poor suffer,1
and that no unworthy are allowed to
hang "around."
TRADING AT HOMfl"
THE movement on the part of the
Commercial Club to secure the patro
nage of home institutions by having
the local merchants sign an agree
ment to patronize no other is in the
right direction, but it seems redicu
Ious that such a move is necessary.
The "Trade at Home" movement
is not one to be established with any
degree of satisfaction in a day. it
must be the result of a constructive
campaign, carefully planned and exe
cuted and continued with the tena
city a man gives his personal busi
ness when he is "fighting" to succeed,
and must keep everylastingly at it.
It is unfortunate that we have to
begin this movement among those
who are most effected by it and real
ize the economic evil of such transac
tions. '
If the Mexico merchants would ex
ort their influence in a unified effort,
along intelligent and constructive
lines, results would follow in a short
time. As it is, they complain but offer
no remedy and if one is suggested
question its advisability and continue
to palaver.
They, wo are not speaking of the
faithful few, make no effort to com
bat their greatest business enemy but
apparently, would rather show any
bellicose propensities they may de
velop in an effort to keep trade from
their competitor. As long as this
condition exists just so long will the
"trade at home" movement moult,
and mail order houses flourish.
A town divided against itself will
never grow in a business way. You
can compete with the man who car
ries the same line you sell in town
but that does not interfer with your
co-operating with him against the
common enemy.
There are towns in this country
many of them, that have solved the
"trade at home" problem. Mexico
can do it. But in our present frame
of mind such a thing is not possible.
There are business men here who are
capable and intelligent but take no
more interest in public matters, we
mean personal interest where their
personal efforts would count, and
count big, than if they were not resi
dents here.
It takes all not a few to build a
community, to win a fight. The soon
er 'petty .personalities and jealousies
are buried bcHeatfi jfriendly unity of
purpbsV the better for all interested..
The "trade at home" problem is
one of many phases. Each requiring
a different manner of solution. That
we do not settle this problem is a
reflection on our intelligence, busi
ness acumen and ability.
When a man does not get his share
of the business in a community it is
no ones fault but his own. What is
worth having is worth going after.
Knocking the town is only to disguise
one's weakness.
The present movement should not
be allowed to die. It should be taken
in hand and furthered. Not ten or
twenty but ALL of the business men
should lend it active personal support.
Don't say, "I'm with you in what ever
you decide to do" but say "I'll be
there and doing my part with you
toward winning this fight."
Hot air never did anything but
send up balloons and they floated
only a short time, turned turtle and
were back on the ground in a little
while.
To win a "trade at home" campaign
means battling in the trenches from
the very beginning; eternal vigilance;
some one always on duty and no
shirkers in the ranks. Let us show
that Mexico is the best place to trade
and keep it up. If you local merchants
don't buy at home what do you ex
pect of others?

announcement regarding the raise in

that milady's patterns have soared
