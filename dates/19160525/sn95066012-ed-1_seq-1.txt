AUSTRIAN ATTACK
8
A)
Captured Positions Strengthened
With Artillery
'.1 ANY GUNS OF LARGE CALIBRE
Italians Have Hampered Advance of
the Enemy By Destroying
Bridges.
Rome, May 24. The Austrian offen
sive along the Italian front, which be
gun ten days ago, is assuming more
and more the character of the Herman
offensive at Verdun.
After having occupied the advanced
positions, from which the Italians with
drew, the Austrians are now strength-
ning and organizing themselves there
They have concentrated additional ar
tillery under command of General Koe-
vess and have been attempting, but
ithout success, to cut the Italians'
rear communications for supplies. Tile
advance of the Austrians has been ren
dered more dillicult by the destruction
of bridges and roads.
Italian olliccrs estimate that be
tween the Adige and Brenta Hirers
the Austrians have placed twenty-six
batteries of guns of 305 calibre, aside
from many other batteries of smaller
guns, and have brought from the Gall-
lan and Balkan fronts fresh troops to
the number of eighteen divisions, or
GO.Ouo men.
Arsiero is one of the towns that has
offered most severely from the bom
bardment.
Austrian prisoners say that prior to
the beginning of the offensivo they
were told that it was the intention to
apture the Venetian provinces by
storm, beginning with the province of
kenza. Tho Austrian officers gave
orders that the Austrian soldiers, once
on Italian territory, must not show
themselves weak, but that they must
not act brutally toward the population.
They promised that next summer the
men might take the baths at Lido, In
Venice, on the Adriatic.
This extensive movement by the
Austrians Is styled by them "the of
fensive toward the Valley of the l'o
Hive:."

in 72 Hours of Continuous
Fighting
Herlin, May 23. The Great German

the bloodiest .fighting of the war. The
right jaw in two days has moved three
miles northwest of Fort pouaumont.
Tho Fiench have evacuated all posi

Paris, May 24. As the result of a
continuous attack on both sides of the
Meuse last night and today, the Ger
mans have won two notable successes
at the expenditure of thousands of
men.
East of le Le Mort Homme, on
the left bank of the river, they occupi
ed the village of Cumieres, and took, a
trench between the village and le
Mort Homme.
This afternoon, on the east bank.
Fort Douaumont, which the French re
captured Monday, was retaken by the
Germans. The French still retain the
immediate approach to the fort.
The retaking of the fort was the re
sult of the concentration of repeated
attacks of the most desperate charac
ter against this point. Two Bavarian
divisions, brought to the Verdun front
recently, were employed.
The bombardment of this section
iiad continued without Interruption
since the French took the position and
had increased in violence particularly
this afternoon when the already tre
mendous expenditure of ammunition
was doubled.
The first attacks, made without
counting the cost in men, broke down
under the French first but the effort
was repeated until at last the Ger
mans again occupied the fort, long
since only a mass of ruins but valu
able because of the high position on
which it stands.
While the bulk of the German at
tacking troops were conducting those
attacks on the fort, other forces were
attempting to Hank the French posi
tions in the Caillcttc wood, immediate-
southeast of the fort, these at
tempts broke down under the French
tire and the end of the day found tho
French still holding the terrain adjoin
ing the ruins of the fort and all their
positions in the woods.
While this trrlblo lighting was in
progress on the east bank of the river
rioth Germans and French simultane
ously took the offensive on the west
banu in the section of Cumieres and
lo Mort Homme, the Germans attempt
ing to continue their advance from the
village of Cumieres an dtlie French at
tempting to regain the village..
Tho Germans failed to carry their
lines beyond the positions occupied
last night and the? French counter at
tacks were successful to the extent of
recovering u trench on the edge of the
village.

ROBINS MOOSE CHAIRMAN
Progressives Select Him at Meeting
Held in New York.
New York. May 24. Raymond Hob-
ins of Chicago, was selected as tem
porary chairman of the national con
vention of the progressive party at
Chicago at a meeting here today of
the executive committee of the pro
gressive national committee.
Other olllcers selected were O. K.
Davis of New York, secretary and F.
P. Corrlck of Nebraska, sergeant at

Mr. Hobins, the choice for tempor
ary chair mini, w as the progressive can

when the Klondike rush began. He
wa? one ot the hrst to go to the gohl
fields and was successful in his quest
there. Prior to 1912 when he joined
the progressive ranks he was a demo
crat. Iteports indicated, it was said, that
the attendance of delegates and alter
nates would exceed 2000 instead of
1250 as ulloted In the olllcinl call.
This increase, according to Secretary
Davis, Is explained by the fact that
many of the states are sending double

their voting Ftrength, however, for the
votes will be split. The auditorium
where the convention is to bo held has
a scaling capacity of 3090.

"Our licet of dreadnoughts and pre

ENGLAND REFUSES
TO LET US HAVE
I
Official Denial That Such Permis
sion Had Been Given
NOT TO ENGLAND'S INTEREST
Administration at Washington Report
ed to Be Hoping To Secure
Some Concessions.
London, May 25. Lord Robert Cecil,
British minister of war trade, informed
the House of Commons yesterday after
noon that a proposal had been re
ceived to permit the exportation from
Germany to the American government
of dyestuffs but that no answer had
yet been jjiven. The war trM'..: min
ister donied repoits given much pub
licity in England that lir r.s-es had
beeu granted for the export from Ger
many to the United States of $5,000,
ouo worth of dyes, part of a shipment
which might reach $30,000,000.
Lord Robert agreed with Sir John
Lonsdale, conservative member for
Mid Armagh, who was the questioner.
that the object of Germany's desire
to export dyestuff was to keep up Ger
man exchange with America. He
added: "Unquestionably it is not to
our interest to allow that to take
place, and 1 will bear that considera
tion very carefully in mind when the
reply is sent to the American govern
ment. It would not bo courteous to
the United States to give assurance
to this House before the reply to them
is actually sent, but 1 assure Sir
John Ixinsdale what he says and what
is the general feeling of the House
will bo borne in mind in any reply
we send."
Lord Robert said that in 1915 the
British government was willing to al
low the exportation from Germany to
the United States of two cargoes of dye
stuffs, but that tills offer had lapsed.
Washington, May 25. Negotiations
with Great Britain are proceeding, state
department officials stated at Washing
ton last night, w ith fair prospect of suc
cess in securing a permit to import at
least a limited quantity of German dyes
to American manufacturers. The de
partment is taking the position that th
original $5.ono,ooi.i permit should be ap
plied to release part of the 15.000 ton1.;
now offered by Germany, if the partie;
Interested can agree upon a basis of
valuation. The department at present
is waiting for the American importers
involved to present a basis of agree
merit lor release of specific shipments
at values to be approved by the Brit
ish government.

of Dr. Arthur Warren Waite
'OTHER WOMAN" TESTIFIES
Ready to Wait "Four "Years or Forty":
For His Release from
Asylum,
New York, May 25. The defence of
Arthur Warren Waite, charged with
the poisoning of his wealthy father-in-
law, John K. Peck of Grand Rapids,
Mich., will be insanity, it was an
nounced by the accused man's counsel
in making his opening statement to
the jury today. The detence will con
tend that the young dentist is insane
at the present time.
New York, May 24. Three women
Klizabeth C. Hard wick, Clara Louise
Peck Waite, the wife, and Margaret
Weaver llurton, the other woman,
brought the trial of Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite for the poisoning of his father
in law. John K. Peck, to a dramatic
climax today.
Miss Hardwick's part was a minor
one. bhe was tne t. Adams, wnose
telegram set iu action the investigation
which brought about the trial.
The wile, calm but repressing her
emotions only by a strong effort, nar
rated the experiences of her married
life, beginning with the whirlwind woo
ing, and ending with the parting with
her husband a few months later at the
Grand Rapids station March 17, when
he departed tor New York and a prison
cell.
Rapidly the incidents fell from the
lips of the wile, the marriage, the talks
about money, Waite's premonitions cf
the death of her father, his actions
during the fatal illness, the prepara
tion of the food, tho fatal eggnog, his
urging cremation, his suggestion that
she make a will and the last letter reJ
ceiveri.

with the man, their language lessons,
voice lessons, dramatic lessons, t heir

almost iu monosyllables, oi the man's
confession to her. Then she told of hi;i
letters, w ritten to her from the hospital
and from the Tombs, in which he de
dared that he would not get the chair,
but an asylum for the criminal insane
from which bo would return to her in
a tew years. Then, almost in a whis
per, of her reply lhat she would wait
for him "four years or forty."
Percy Pock, brother in law of Waite
and son of the man who, the state says
was killed, could add only one tense
moment to the day and that was when
he told how, with the "K. Adams
telecram in Ills pocket and the autopsy
already ordered, he had met Waite at
Grand Rapids and quietly demanded
the checks which would put the body
of his father in his possession. In the
clash of wills the son proved the strong
