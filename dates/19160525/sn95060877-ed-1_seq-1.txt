NEW YORK, May 26.
Women were excluded at the
resumption of the Waite
trial today. Upon being
cross examined he denied
that he planned to kill his
wife and fake insanity
"Are you crasy." compel asked
Waite.
"I think not," he replied. T sleep
well."
"You have never been anything but
a sneak thief."
"That's all."
"You planned Peck's death to win
two million dollars; didn't you?"
"No; not that much."
Justice Shearn asked Waite if he
knew it was wrong to steal, and Waite
answered:
"Yes."
"Then, if you knew it was. wrong
to steal, you knew it was wrong to
murder, didn't you?"
"I don't remember," Waite replied.
Last night Waite- detailed for nearly
six hours the horrors of his unparal
leled crime here. He told of giving
his victims powdered glass, aresnic
and chloroform, also disease germs,
adding that he sprayed Peck's throat
with germs.
Dr. Morris J. Karpas, the defense
alienist, testified that Waite said that
he intended to kill his wife; that he
married only for money; that he now
would stop at nothing to gain his ends.
Karpas said that Waite was an ego
maniac to a marked degree. He added
that Waite said to him:
"I expect to go to the electric
chair; I have always been for myself;
if I wanted money I got' it; if I wanted
women, I got them. I lived entirely
for myself. My life consists of lying
stealing, cheating and killing. My per
sonality, however, was that of a gen
tleman; I went in for music, art and
poetry just as far as I thought would
be required of a gentleman."
Open house for the enjoyment of all
next Saturday night at the Elks' Club
rooms.

Whereas, with the passing of each
year, and especially at this time when
a great portion of the civilized world
is engaged in warfare, by which the
destinies of nations will be immeasur
ably affected, the proper annual ob
servance of Memorial day is fraught
with unusual significance;
Whereas, it is fitting that Memorial
day, in this epoch of world history,
shall be observed through appropriate
exercises whereby the solemn rever
ence of a sovereign people for the
memories of heroes who died in their
country's service may be expressed
with such seriousness and dignity as
becomes a day of mourning and retro
spection; Whereas, the veterans of former
wars who still survive are justly eng
Litled to that recognition and venera
tion which becomes particularly the
subject of solemn thought on the part
of all citizens on that day which is
set aside by law as Memorial day;

Long distance shopping for

shoulders of Captain John
Backland, who expected to
get away this week with the
four-masted sailing schooner, i
C. S. Holmes on his annual
trip to the Arctic ocean. -
Already the arctic night in

'Broadway musical numbers

'machine ordered some years

for it and other articles he
wants with ten fox skins, '
which sold for $1,000. '
The natives study the magazine ad
vertisements which come their way,
and nick out what looks good to
them.
The C. S. Holmes carries 1,000 tons
of cargo this year, in eluding lumber,
paint, stoves and other material for
enlarging the Presbyterian mission
church at Point Barrow and a forty-five-foot
boat for the Methodist Epis
copal mission at Sinuk.

each citizen of Arizona shall forsake
the duties of everyday ilving and rev
erentially meditate upon the sacri
fces of our dead heroes, thereby pay
ing fitting tribute to our nation and
to the memory of such noble spirits
as gave their lives for the preservation
of their country.
I do further urgently recommend
that on Tuesday, May 30, 1916, herein
before set aside as Memorial day, the
churches, fraternal orders and other
civic organizations shall hold suitable
exercises and ceremonies in honor oJ
the hallowed dead, wohse names are
now enrolled upon the country's scroll

Captain Louis L. Lane's 300-ton
wooden schooner, Great Bear, being
built at Port Blakely, Wash., proba
bly will start north about June 10.
She will carry thirty-two men and four
whaleboats and, with her sheathing
to resist ice, will be perhaps the very
strongest boat of her size ever built
in the United States. John Borden,
millionaire sportsman of Chicago, who
is a partner of Captain Lane in the
Great Bear, is here. With Lane and
Borden will go Morris Bokum, C. H.
Knickerbocker and Rochester Slaugh
ter of Chicago; Reginald Fernald, of
Santa Barbara, Cal., and a photograph
er. There will be opportunities for hunt
ing and photographing walrus, polar
bear and other big game before the
Great Bear turns her prow toward
Herschel Island, where Lane hopes to
receive a message from Vilhjalmur
Stefansson, commander of the Canadi
an Arctic expedition. If he receives
no message at Herschel Island, he will
go to Banks Land, where he has
agreed to meet Stefansson between
August 5 and 10.
