WLere "Heavca-sent Birds" Devour
tie Dead Strange and GhasUy
Funeral Rites An Ugly Dream
of India's Night.
India, the land where, until a few
years ago, devout mothers threw their
b..bies to the sacred crocodiles, where
frenzied worshipers sacrificed their
lives beneath the wheels of Jugger
naut and widows were burned upon
tleir husbands' funeral pyres India,
ihe iaud where cows are held sacred
ind men and women are counted unclean-
a land of dire . poverty, and
tilth and superstition, the very relig
ion of which is unspeakably degraded
and degrading has no custom more
gruesome than the disposition of its
dead by way of Towers of Silence.
The most noted of these is at Bom
cay, n a hill overlooking the city.
Hero in the stillness cf an Indian af
ternoon one may Bee the strangest fu
neral rite in the world, to this-Tower
of Silence the Parsco dead are brought.
:he winding sheets are removed and"
the bcrties are left to be devoured by
"heaven-sent birds," the Parseea call
them. Tloeks of ghastly vul'ures they
really are," waiting day by day on the
vails of the tower for the grim reap
er to spread them yet another feast
'Vhen it is readv Jiev extend their
i owcr oi iilcnte, tomuay.
great wings, utter a never-to-be-forgotten
cry, and swoop down heavily
upon their prey. In half an hour only
some scattered boues are left upon
the stone floor of the tower and the
vultures are perched again, silent and
watchful, upon its walls. The keepers
cf the tower, two bearded men who
receive the bodies and deposit them
within, are shunned like lepers and
forbidden to mingle with their fellow
men. - .
As the sacrifice of babies arid wid
ows has disappeared in the light of
.'hristian civilization, so within a few
years the Tower of Silence will be
remembered only as an ugly dream
o India's long night of error and sup
erstition. ' -
- Sunday Observance In China.
Fifteen years ago Sunday was un
known, in Chlnn, except among the
Christians. Today it is universally
recognized in educational circles all
over China as' a day of rest. All
schools and colleges close their door
on Sunday. This surprising change ha
come about solely through the influ
ence of Christian missions, particu
larly that of missionary schools and of
Chinese teachers educated in Chris
tian schools at home and abroad.
-N
One Village a Day for 2000 Years.
As illustrating the vastness of India
and the immensity of its population,
Rev. P. H. Clancy says: If Christ had
started on the day of his baptism to
preach in the villages of India, and bad
continued up to the present, visiting
one village each day, healing the sick
and proclaiming the gospel, be would
still have lert unvisited thirty thou
tmnd villages. The villages of India
contain nine-tenths of the population,
or more than 280,000,000 people.
A Neat Piece of Strategy.,
Using Budha's birthday as an oppor
lunity to introduce Christianity would
seem to be a neat piece of strategy.
How It was done is told by the Princi
pal of Holston Institute, a Southern
Methodist school for girls in Songdo,
Korea: -
"Great crowds came to Songdo sight
seeing on Budha's birthday. So many
l tho visitors came to the school that
II was Impossible to carry on the reg;
.lar work; so we threw open the doom
and gave them the freedom of the.
'ufldins. Groups of our school girls"
met them tvt Hip door 'and escorted
them fhrouph the building, while oth
rs distributed Christian tracts and
nli;ed to tho visitors about Jesus.
The last room visited was the gym
narlum. where the girls gave-a drill,
followed by gospel service. Several
hundred heard the good Hews that day
and perhaps many will believe at a
result" .

Sculptor Has Mount
for Great Memorial
Atlanta, Ga., May 20. -The
work of presenting to the South
a memorial ot the Uvil war,
unique in design and scope, for
mally was begun today at Stone
mountain, near here. The moun
tain is a solid block of stone, and
on one of its most precepitous
peaks will be carved figures
nearly 40 feet in height of the
South's heroes and scenes de
picting the great war.
Some years ago ,,the United
Daughters of the Confederacy
conceived the idea of such a
monument and enlisted the aid
of S. E. " Venerable, who owns
the mountain. Part of the cere
monies today was the presenta
tion to an officer of the Daugh
ters of the Confederacy, by Mr.
Venerable, of a deed Jo that part
of the mountain.
While virtually all the monu
ment will be cut of the solid
rock, it will be necessary howev
er to erect corner posts. It was
the laying of the first block on
one of these posts that occasioned-
the celebration today.
The principal speakers were
Federal Judge Speer and John
Temple Graves. Guston Bor
glum," the sculptor, will have
charge of the work.
The central group of the car
vings will be equstrian figures of
Lee, Jackson, Johnson, Gordon,
Davis, and other heroes. ' These
figures will stand . about 37
feet high. The group will ex
tend 3,000 feet around the face
of the mountain.
A great hall cut at the bas6 of
the mountain will be 180 feet
long and 60 feet deep. It will
have 13 colums cut from solid
rock, representing the 13 Con
federate states. In it will be
stored archives and records of
the war between the states.
It will require eight years to
complete the work.

Porridge Unjustly Accused.
It is asserted and also denied that
porridge was the lcause of Thomas
Carlyle' ruined digestion. Sir Rick
ard Quain said porridge had nothing
to do with his ruined digestion. Sir
Richard stated in the British Medical
Journal of November 9, 1S55, that "the
wretched dyspepsia to which Mr. Car
lyle was subjected was fully accounted
for by the fact that he was particular
ly fond of very nasty gingerbread.
Many times I have seen him sitting in

eating this gingerbread.'
