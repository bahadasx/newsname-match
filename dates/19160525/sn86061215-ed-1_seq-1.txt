VERDUN BATTLE
COSTING BOTH
SIDESJEflVILY
Paris Reports That Strife
Is the Bloodiest That
Has Yet Occurred
GERMAN ATTACKS
CALLED FAILURES
French Claim That Early
Advantages of Enemies
Have Been Offset
Paris, May 34. —The battle around
Verdun continues to rage with a vlo
lence unexampled even in this re
gion. The Germans are striving with
every resource in their power to cap
ture Hill 804 and Dead Man hill, on the
left bank of the Meuse and to win back
the famous Ft. Douaumont on the right
bank, which was wrested from them
by Gen. Nivelle's brilliantly planned
and executed offensive.
Without full possession of the line
from Pepper hill to Vaux fort, the Ger
mans can not hope to capture Verdun.
Even if they succeeded in taking this
line they could not hold it unless they
were also in possession of Hill 304 and
Dead Man hill, which outflank the line.
Driven to desperation by seeing so
much of its work undone, the German
command has hurled attack after at
tack against Ft. Douaumont. At the
same time it has kept up its onslaught
tin the left bank of the river to pre
vent the French transferring any
forces to the main scene of attack.
All day yesterday the tide of war
ebbed and flowed, inches of ground be
ing won and lost at an appalling cost
in men. As one French officer *aid
"Plots of land come high here." Again
and again after reducing tranches to
a crumbling heap of ruins by a deluge
of shells, the German infantry dashed
forward, only to be caught and swept
away by a hurricane of curtain fire
from the French batteries and ma
chine guns.
The conditions of the present war
have transformed the traditional furi
OUB
courage of the French soldiers in
to Immovable stoicism. Men have
stood their ground manfully in a situa
tion which seemed beyond human na
ture to support. When night fell the
positions on both sides were unchang
ed. The French held all their gains
while the Germans incurred fearful
losses without getting near to any de
cisions. Describing the battle around
Ft. Douaumont, one combatant said:
"Four four miles behind us there
was not a trench or a communication,
nothing but shell holes, one within an
other. Every inch of the ground was
plowed up by an expenditure of am
munition which is inconceivable. It is
the abomination of desolation. Not for
a second do their guns cease roaring
or men cease falling. As soon as a
trench is made the shells begin to drop
and the survivors have to begin all
over again. Attacks have become al
most impossible because in the terrific
tornado of artillery fire the infantry on
either side is unable to advance or re
treat. Verdun will certainly not be
taken from this point.
"I can not understand how our men
are able to keep it up. You are exter
minated in your boots without seeing
the enemy. The terrific noise leaves us
half stunned. Men look at each other
with bewildered eyes. It requires a
strong effort of the will to speak to a
comrade."
GERMANS STORM TOWN.
Berlin, May 24. —The capture by
Thuringian troops of the village of
Cumieres, east of Dead Man hill, on
the Verdun front, was announced by
the war office this afternoon. The vil
lage was taken by storm. So far more
than 300 prisoners, Including eight of
ficers, have been taken by the Ger
mans in this operation.
AUSTRIANS RESTING.
Rome, May 24.—Austrian military
activity has been unexpectedly follow
ed by a sudden slackening which is
interpreted in military circles here .as
necessary to replace the Austrian
losses and to bring up fresh troops for
a stronger offensive. The Austrian
commanders evidently are planning to
extend the line of attack as large as
semblages of reinforcements continue
to be reported along the banks of
Lake Garda.
"These troops apparently Intend to
attempt to invade Italy along the
northern province of Brescia."

SERBIAN PRINCE
IS CONFIDENT OF
FINAL SUCCESS
TELLS AMERICAN NEWSPAPER
MAN THAT HIS COUNTRY WILL
BE RESTORED.
Athens, May 24.—Prince Alexander
of Serbia, regent of King Peter's land
less kingdom, in an interview today
with a representative of The Asso
ciated Press, said that he had assur
ances from all the allies that no set
tlement of the war would be accepted
which did not provide for the restora
tion of Serbia.
The prince appeared grave and stern
with that expression of sadness whi«h
seems to be the heritage of every Slav.
He was thin and worn from the hard
ships through which he has passed,
but seemed in excellent health.
"I receive you," he said, "to prov*
how deeply I appreciate the tone of
the American presB, which, while de
fending the sacred principle of the
liberty of all peoples, has thereby ren
dered justice to our rights to exist as
an independent nation. Serbia de
sires to live in peace but only on con
dition that its aspirations, culture and
language are respected as it respects
those of others."
The prinoe chatted unaffectedly of
the hardships which he and his troops
had endured in their retreat through
Albania. Always, however, he return
ed to the one thought which fills his
mind—the driving -of the invaders
from his country..
"I was very glad," he said, "to be
able to assure myself during my" visits
to the capitals of the allies that our
legitimate expectations have found
the sincerest sympathy and will have
the most efficacious aid. I was assur
ed that the allies are united in their
determination that Serbia must be re
stored."
PEACE BEYOND DVINA.
London, May 24.—An order of the
day Baid to have been issued recently
by Field Marshal von Hindenburg to
his men on the Russian front is quoted
as follows, In a Central News dis
patch from Basel, Switzerland:
"For some time a rumor haSr been
spreading among the troops that peace
negotiations- are about to begin and
this fact, coupled with the instinct of
self preservation which is constantly
growing, is having a bad effect on the
morale of the men.
"In the name of the emperor I de
clare that there can not be any ques
tion, of peace until we have crossed
the Dvina. Soldiers, if you wish peace
go and seek it on the other side of
the Dvina."
CUMMINS SECURES
MINNESOTA'S VOTE
Pierre, S. D., May 24.—That Peter
Norbeck, lieutenant governor, has won
the republican nomination for gover
nor, is shown by return received up to
early this morning. The. precincts re
porting up to that hour show he re
ceived nearly double the vote of his
two republican opponents.
Willis C. Cook of Sioux Falls was

D. Morcom of Sioux Falls has attained
apparently the democratic guberna

Des Moines, May 24.—Pleas for bet

and five or six reels in length, were
made today by speakers at the annual
convention of the Iowa Association of
Motion Picture Exhibitors.
"The day of the jitney opera, as the
five cent show has been known, is
past," said one exhibitor. "People
want to see clean plays and long ones.
Slapstick comedy of the lower sort is
dead. The twenty-five cent theaters

—A marked difference between Villls
ta strongholds and other towns in
southern Chihuahua was reported to
day by officers who have made the
campaigns close on Villa's trail.
In the solid Villlsta districts there
were evidences of prosperity. The
people there declared that Villa pro
tected them, taking what he needed
from them wtth considerable sense of
discrimination. The towns of mixed
politics, peopled by both Villa and
Carrania partisans, were all on the
verge of misery. The Vlllstas in such
places reported that Villa was In the
habit of protecting them but of plun

They complained that Carranza com

Carranzistas without discrimination,

Expedition Welcomed.
Speaking of the foray into Mexico,
Ool. Sibley said today:
'1 believe that our men have shown
that bandits and murderers can not
operate with impunity for long in the
Big Bend country. Our column was
a little slow In reaching the scene of
the depredations, but once there, we
lost no time in finding their trail,
catching up with them and finally dis
persing them, which was one object
of the expedition..
"Our column was welcomed along
the route by the natives because the
bandits had covered the samfl road in
their retreat and had comm% '?d out-

J. P. Irish Says Women Do
Not Possess Necessary
Physical Courage
SAYS CONDITIONS
ARE WORSE ON COAST
Cites California Cities
Examples of Failure of
Suffrage to Improve
as
Holding that the ballot is a penalised
responsibility constantly under the
shadow of the criminal law, which
makes man stand behind and defend
the laws made by the ballot and im
poses punishment for his failure to
live up to his responsibilities due to
the exercise of the ballot, John P. Irish
of California, a former Iowa resident,
spoke at the Grand opera house Tues
day night for almost two hours. The
lack of physical courage to defend the
law by force, was urged against wom
en having the ballot. The former
Iowan attacked woman suffrage taking
the position of an attorney prosecut
ing a case and using as witnesses
letters, printed statements, speeches,
reports, etc., of others largely Cali
fomians but Including Judge Ben
Lindsey of Denver, among the list. He
also referred to Herbert Spencer,
Gladstone, John Bright and even the
philosopher Plato to support his con
tention against suffrage in its various
phases.
The lower floor of the opera house
was prety well filled and a few were
in the balcony. H. L. Waterman open
ed the meeting and introduced the
speaker.
"The question of enlarging or di
minishing the electorate is one of the
biggest questions which can come be
fore the voters," Col. Irish said in
opening. "There are two main issues
to be considered.
"Do those who are to be granted the
ballot want suffrage?
"Why was suffrage not made uni
versal in the first place?
"Suffragists say that man has usurp
ed the right of the ballot for his own
uses.
"I deny this. I deny that the ballot
is a right.
"To exist a government must en
force its laws and defend its sov
ereignty. In order that this could be
done the framers of the constitution
gave man the ballot. It is a penalized
responsibility. In order to hold the
ballot a man must be ready at all
times to enforce its laws and defend
its rights with his own life, if neces
sary.
If a peace officer calls upon citi
a riot
spond, must risk his own life if neces
sary. If he refuses -he may be fined
or sent to jail. If this were not the
case there would be disorders, chaod.
anarchy.
"The laws which gave, man the bal
lot are founded on the laws of God
which gave man physical strength and
courage to defend his nation. Only in
this is man woman's superior and It is
on this physical strength that govern
ments are founded and maintained.
"No man of normal reasoning power
believes that man is superior to woman
in any other thing and all know that
woman makes up for this in a spiritual
courage which no man has,
"That is the vital reason why the
b&llot was given to man and why man
should retain it and not subject wom
ankind to those things which he must
bear in return for hiB right to vote.
"The second big question of suffrage
is:
"Do women want the vote?
"In states where suffrage has car
ried they have shown conclusively that
they do not. They have shown that if
it Is granted to them they will not
register, they will not vote, they will
have nothing whatever to do with it.
"In California, where suffrage pass
ed in 1911 only 20 per cent of the wo
men in the state have voted.
"I am now going to appear as the
attorney in this caae and produce evi
dence to show that my contentions are
correct,"
Col. Irish prbduced an interview
from Mrs. F. H. Colborn, wife of the
assistant manager of the San Francis
co clearing house and editorials from
the San Francisco Chronicle to show
that only about 20 per cent of the wo
men in California voted and that these
women were not representative of the
women of California.
"Moral conditions are worse In Cali
fornia since suffrage was adopted than
before," Col. Irish declared. ""The Na
tional association of Social Hygiene
during a meeting in San Francisco last
y£ar made a report warning all young
women to keep away from San Fran
cisco on account of moral conditions.
"Senator Frank Lyons of Los An
geles, in a recent speech deplored the
fact that that city was overrun with
disorderly houses. In Sacramento the
Ministerial association a few months
ago passed resolutions against the
flagrant violations of all moral laws in
that city.

BRANDEISCISE
BY PARTISAN VOTE
COMMITTEE WILL RECOMMCNO
TO THE SENATE THAT NOM

Washington, D. C., May 24. —The
senate judiciary committee voted 10 to
8 today to report favorably to the sen
ate the nomination of Louis D. Bran
dels to be associate justice of the
supreme court. It waa a strict party
vote.
The action of the committee remain
ed In doubt up to the time the rote was
taken. Senator Shields, democrat of
Tennessee arrived in the capital today
just in time to cast the deciding vote.
Senator Cummins of Iowa was the
only member of the committee not
present. His vote, however, was re
corded against confirmation.
The vote la one of the final steps In
a contest which started aB soon as the
nomination was sent to the senate by
President Wilson January 28. Weeks
were spent by a subcommittee taking
testimony regarding charges against
the nominee, formulated by a commit
tee of citizens of Boston. The sub
committee recommended confirmation
by a strict party vote of three to two.
The charge against Mr. Brandeis
was unethical conduct in relation to
several clients and "working under
cover." President A. Lawrence Low
ell of Harvard headed the committee
of citizens organized to fight confirma
tion. William H. Taft, Simeon E. Bald
win, Francis Rawle, Joseph H. Choate,
Elihu ROot, Moorfleld Storey and Peter
W. Meldrim, each a former president
of the American Bar association, also
opposed confirmation.
Charles V. Eliot, president emeritus
of Harvard, only a few days ago wrote
a letter to the committee strongly urg
ing confirmation Secretary of War
Baker appeared on the witness stand
to ask for confirmation on the basis of
Mr. Brandeis' efforts to establish social
justice and President Wilson recently
wrote a personal letter to Chairman
Culberson urging confirmation.

He added, however, that he was not
