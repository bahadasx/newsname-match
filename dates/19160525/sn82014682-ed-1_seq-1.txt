first sailing is only five months away,
everybody in the islands should pre
pare for the coming of great crowds
of visitors. Last winter?. were not

AVOID AMERICA
NEW PLANS FOR
COLONIZATION
. (Spociftl CWe to Kippu Jiji) .
T0K1O, Jayan. , May 25.Japan
will begin a great colonization plan
at once in the South Seas.' Hereto
fore the Japanese have looked long
ingly toward America, but in the' past
few weeks the travel to the United
States has decreased.and at a meet
ing of a newly organized society yes
terday in this city plans were ar
ranged for a great colonization of the
islands of. the Pacific. ,
The new society Is called the Japan
South Sea Development Association,
and la backed by a number of promi
nent Japanese. The first step in the
'5C rlan to Insure a permanence will be
he establishment of a Japanese
school In Singapore, Straits Settle
ments, for the education of Japanese
on commerce in the South Seas.
' Before the European war Germany
had a big hold on the business in the
' Pacific, including the smaller islands,
Borneo, Java, Sumatra and other sec
tions. . Since that time England and
Holland have controled the commer
cial situation, and Japan will make
every effort to secure a permanent
basis to work on In the future.
Japan has already sent a number
of colonists to the Marshall islands
and other islands in the Pacific cap
tured by Japan, and the tendency to
ward immigration will in the future be
toward the countries of the South
-Seaa Instead of the American coun
tries borderingonttePaclfic.

lACk ol yrater atie fire in the
t'nlon PaHflc Trajrsfer stables on
1 Onppa utrptt Yesterday was not due
to any fauR of tile water department
but to deficiencies in the City water
system, "ire JChief Charles Thurston
conferred; with Harry Murray, mana
ger of he y water , department, this
morninf nd the . jtwo agreed ) that
thpre taJ nothinz that' could' have
been done yesterday, to get more wa-
i " Tri?:'jrLl-
of the stables and an adjoining cot-
tae.
"There are other Isections of the city
that would have suffered similarly in
the case of a big fire like that one yes
terdasV asserted Thurston. "There
was not enough water out there and
no way of. getting it Outside of the
central and Kal'hi districts, served by
the , Beretania street and Kalihi
pumps, the -city -is served by small
mains that are totally inadequate for
fire protection. A small fire can ( be
conquered with water from a six sor
eight-iuch main but not a big fire
like the one we had yesterday. It Is
only because water can be diverted
from Kalihi to Beretania mains, or
vice versa, that the districts served
by those, two pumps are sure of an
adequate water supply in case of a
big fire."
Murray explained that his request
for the proceed of a bond issue for
Improvements in the city's water sys
tem, submitted at Tuesday's meeting
off the supervisors, was made in the
hojpe of getting adequate fire protec
tion for all parts of the city.,, His es
timate of the total cost was $357,000.
He asks that 3150,000 of ; this be
available next year and the remainder
the year following.
"Many sections of the city have no
fire hydrants. Others have no water
mains;" he sai l this morning. "This
means that In case of a big tire they
would be almost helpless. Except. for
the district from Makiki street in, and
Kalihi, the fire department can ! get
enough water to fight anything be
yond a very small fire. Nothing can
be dons about it unless there is money
to do it with. The only remedyl see
is a bond issue to provide for addi
tions to the system." ;

Following a story in the Star-Bulletin
Monday disclosing wholesale gam
bling every day on the early morning
labor train, stringent actions have
been taken to suppress the evil. Rail
way and police officials believe the
present plan" will be an effective
check. :
Conductor E. A. Donnelly yesterday
and Tuesday made an announcement
in every coach that the names of all
men found gambling on the train will
be turned in to the heads of the , dif
ferent departments and?- their dis
charge will follow.,
According to an observer who
makes the trip daily, "there are no
dice or money in sight and the train
has every appearance of a Sunday,
school picnic since the announcement
was made."
Careful inspection of every one of
the 12 coaches in the train this morn
ing revealed not a single game. Mon
day morning there were' several.
"Gambling is 'pauv as far as my
train is concerned," said Conductor
Donnelly to the Star-Bulletin- today.
"I have told the passengers to cut
it out. Their employers will back me
up in the new plan. If the gamblers
don't think we mean business,- let
them ifctart something. -They'll' find
out quick enough then. "The' com
pany's playing to favorites. "Crap"
shooting must step."" x- '
Donnelly has tried hard in the past
to stoj gambling on' his train buc says
that heretofore he has not had the
proper method. He believes ;the pres
ent one ' is. The conductor has
stopped games repeatedly,, has kicked
dice out of the cars,. has threatened to
throw gamblers off: the train, has in
turn been threatened by the gamblers
and has instructed his trainmen to
break' up . all gambling. His efforts
were practically unnoticed.
"The" moment my back was turned
the dice started rolling again," says
Donnelly.. "I'm not a policeman. I
had my train to run. I couldn't be- in
12 coaches all at once. It was prac
ficaily impossible to ' rr.shten the
gamblers. However, now that their
jobs are In peril I think they are
through." 1.

. Investigating this rumor the Star
Bulletin called upon Georg F. Rodiek
at the offices of Hackfeld & Company.
"There are ,'so many-rtnnors afloat,
aid he, 'that it is hard to keep track
of them. There has been no action
taken on these matters by the directors.-
The rumors are as to what action
the directors may take, rumors only
of possible. action." Thus neither de
nial . nor confirmation of any basis
was given., v "
Waialuaas freely offered.. "About
the street it was said that the suit
yesterday instituted by the Bishop
estate was largely of a friendly nature
to determine the exact rights of the
estate. That its income from these
lands is dependent upon revenues re
ceived from it and that much of the
land now, not in use could be planted
in pineapples by the Waialua company
or leased' by them for that purpose
and that the action contemplates forc
ing some such result. Loss of the
leases was not considered likely.
Mineral Products is again reported
strong with sales made at $1 and $1.03.
Duisenberg & Co. are in receipt
of a cable from San Francisco stating
that Tipperary, which has been large
ly bought here, sold yesterday to the
extent of 24,000 shares at 10 cents.
The price is not high and the state
ment is made as showing demand for
the stock;
At the exchange session Oahu sold
a $4.37. Olaa also advanced ani
has again touched $22. McBryde
stod at $14.50 and Waialua declined
to $36.
FRAME COTTAGE
Fire destroyed a cottaged used as a
bachelors' club by a group of soldiers
at 1045 Kamehameha IV road early
this morning. There was no one in
the place at the time and Fire Chief
Thurston is at a loss to account for
the origin of the blaze, unless it was
caused by a cigarette stub left burn
ing. The cottage is owned by Mrs.
Manual Richards, who rented it to the
soldiers furnished. The house and fur
nishings were injured for $1100, ac
cording: to the fire chief, and the loss j
is estimated at about that amount.'
About half of the building is still
standing, but will have to be torn
dovn a3 n cannot be repaired.
There as plenty of water for the
firemen to use this morning. "The
Kalihi pump can furnish all we need,"
declared Chief Thurston today. "Then,
too, the blaze broke out early in the
morn.ng, ar little before 5 o'clock, and
no one was using the water none was
diverted 'or irrigating or household
purposes."
