Saturday night has nothing to do
with the large prizes. These are just
. given in addition to the large prizes.
They will be won by the ladies turning
inv the largest number of new
subscriptions. With every subscription
for one year you get 9,000 votes
to apply on the big prizes at the
dose of the contest June 24, 1916.
Usually there is one road open to
L success,but in the present case there
T are three, though the easiest way to
succeed is to combine all three. By
three ways we mean that it is possible
for one to build up her vote total
by gathering and saving the coupons,
by getting her friends to trade
with the merchants who are giving
' tickets and by getting subscriptions
I and renewals.
' Those who are in arrears can pro
cure votes for their favorite canai-1
' date by paying what they owe. Every
dollar paid on subscriptions will
get some lady 9,000 votes.
It is also well for the candidates
to remember that the territory in
which they can carry on their campaign
is not limited. Some of our
candidates get the idea that they
cannot work outside of the district
^ in which they live. You are not limited
to any one place. Bear this in
. mind and make a complete canvass
of any territory in which you have
friends. Phone to everybody within
reach. Write letters and make as
many personal calls as possible. In
this way a great many people will .
know of your candidacy and rally to
your support.
v. There is, 'tis said, a certain place
down below that is paved with good
intentions. Alto "The Valley of
Pretty Soon" is white with the
bleaching bones of those who succumbed
while telling others what
they were just about to do.
Do not1 be one of these. Work j
steadily and continuously; make every
moment count. You are not!
alone in this race by any means, and
in order to win you must be a little
more energetic than anyone else.
HON R A COOPER SPEAKS 1

On "Preparedness."'
The Hon R A Cooper, Solicitor of j
the eighth cfrcuit and candidate for ,
Governor, waa the speaker of the
evening to the graduating class of old

His theme was "Preparedness" and
in no way did Mr Cooper refer to
his candidacy or touch upon politi

gument on conditions leading to the
great war in Europe, where nations
have busied themselves for years in
perfecting great armies, navies and
engines of warfare, while they have
neglected the most essential requirement?that
preDaredness of character
which must be attained in order
that a civic and political government
may be had whos6 ideals are
such that differences can be met
and adjusted without the necessity
of resorting to war, and the terrible
sacrifice of life and property that
must follow.
He stressed the fact that character
building through education must
keep pace with material progress in
order that a civic and political equilibrium
may be maintained in a community.
History, he said, teaches
that the fall of empires through the

ate increase of material wealth with
social and civic progress.
In urging: the great work to be
accomplished in this field by the
rural school, he stated that the
dormitories of all the institutions of
higher learning in this State, if filled
to their utmost capacity, will af-1
ford room for only ten per cent of
the high school graduates. What a
resposibility rests upon the rural
school, he said, in preparing the
other ninety per cent for the battles
of the world.
In concluding, he complimented
Williamsburg county on the record
she is making in this work. Within
a radius of two miles from the platform
upon which he stood there
were four graded schools, employing
a teaching force of some eighteen
teachers, and caring for five
hundred or more children, Surely,
this is a record for any community
to be proud or.
The Saxon,
One of the "niftiest" little cars
that has appeared on the Kingstree
market is that now being handled
by Mr M F Heller. It is the Saxon,
a four and six cylinder car with all
the modern equipments that ordinarily
belong to the higher priced
machines. Messrs W R Scott and P
G Gourdin, respectively, were the
first Kingstree citizens to purchase
the Saxon.

The directors of the Easley cotton
mills have declared a stock dividend
of 25% in addition to a semi-annual
dividend of 5%.
A "teacher training" course will
be added to the curicuium of the
Florence schools, beginning next
session.

Messrs W A Coleman and J 0 1
Finklea, of Hyman, spent Monday '
in our town. ,
Mr P G Gourdin came from Kingstree
Monday afternoon and was in
town a short while. ' |
Dr C D Rollins went to Petersburg;
Va, Sunday morning to join
Mrs Rollins and children, who have i
been there about a month. All will <
return together the latter part of
the week. ,
Mr Huggins, cashier of the Bank ;
of Hemingway, and Mrs Huggins 1
and children stopped over here Sun- I
day on their way to Lamar to visit
the parents of Mrs Huggins.
Shipments of peas are about over.
Good stands were obtained when this
crop came up in the winter and
plants grew off well, but later the
fruit was injured by the excessive
drought, which parched the leaves
and peas. Hence the product when
marketed did not bring satisfactory
prices.
strawDernes are turning out very j
well. Owing to lack of moisture the
berries are not large and 'are high
in acidity, yet they are firm and
hold up well in shipment. Prices
have been good all along since the \
season opened.
* Beans are now going forward in
increasing quantities. The first two
plantings vere largely killed by cold.
Hence this crop is later than usual.
Prices so far have been good.
Cotton is now coming up nicely,
since the rain of a week ago. And
with the cotton grass is coming, too.
This means that the fishing pole
must be shoved under the house,
and the hoe set to swinging.
A H Williams, Sr, A H Williams,
Jr, and G F Stalvey were in Florence
Tuesday afternoon on business.
A Confederate veteran who attended
the reunion in Birmingham
last week informed this writer a few
days ago that it was ascertained at
the reunion that the youngest veteran
still living is an Alabamian and
is sixty-six years old. He enlisted
at the age of fifteen and served the
last year of the war.
Cris Johnson got no more than he
deserved, possibly less. One almost
regrets that the escort did not take
a buggy trace along to assist Johnson
in crossing Black river on the
"high gear."
Claude Gasque, Esq, of Florence,
was in Magistrate Baldwin's court

Cease Loving Thee" and "Not Less
Than This". Promptly at the hour
