the Nominees
The county board of election met
this week and have issued the ballots
to be voted on at the coming primary
June 3.
A number of prospective candidates
failed to qualify before the final date
of entrance, May. 20.
The County Democratic ballot is
minus a number of nominations for va
rious offices. The only candidates
seeking office are those for state sen
ate and legislature, on the county pri
mary ballot.
Xinety-six ballot boxes have been de
livered at the various polls in the coun
ty and the tickets will be placed in the
hands of the judges this week.
After discussing means of arranging
the ticket it was decided by the board
of elections to draw the name of each
candidate from a hat in order to de
cide whose name to be placed at the
head of the ticket. This method was
used in selecting the order of the
names of all the candidates for each
office.
The county Democratic and Repub
lican ticket to be voted on will appear
printed below on the official ballots.
All candidates who have no opposition
in the primary will be declared the

GREAT SEASON
FOR
More and more evidence pours in
prove that Hendersonville is going to
enjoy one of the best fcjummer seasons
in the history of the city.
Hotels and boarding houses are re
ceiving guest daily and the inquiries
from the hot South are being received
in every mail.
Owners of summer homes are having
preparations made for the early occu
pancy of same, in fact a number of
owners, have arrived already and are
enjoying the fine weather and ideal
climate of this immediate section.
Secretary Bridges urges all the
boarding house keepers to supply him
With the number of guests they can ac
commodate along with rates and other
particulars. He receives quite a num
ber of applications every day and is
FARM LIFE INSURANCE.
State Board of Health, Advises Rural
Dwellers to Seek Protection
Against Summer' Diseases.
The best life insurance .the farmer
or rural dweller can take out this
summer, advises the State BqaYd of
Health, is that that will insure him
and his family . protection against
three of the most common and serious
of summer diseases typhoid fever,
diarrheoal diseases and hookworm.
This insurance may be had by ony one
who desifes this protection and is
willing to pay the price. The rates
are fixed according to the residence
and the degree of protection desired
The premiums remain at home and de
clare unusually bi dividends annually.
This particular kind of life insur
ance, probably . better termed health
insurance, as explained by the Board,
is based upon three home conditions
the home water supply. tEe home
methpd pf disposing. of sewage and the
protection of the homeagainst files.
The water supply must be free from
pollution. It should receive no sur
face drainage and should be on higher
ground than any stables, out houses or
privies. The hands should never come
in contact with bucket or chain. For
this reason pumps and wells having
closed tops are much safer than open
wells. The farm home privy, to be
safe, must be flyproof and so construc
ted as not to pollute the surrounding
soil. The pit type of privy with a
closed back has been recommended to
meet these needs. The farm home,
furthermore, must be screened. Where
it is impractical on the farm and else
where to keep flie3 from breeding al
together, it is practical to screen all
the doors and windows of the house,
the back porch' Included, and be free
from flies.
"In conclusion, says the Board,
"the three things needed for. a farmer
to have freedom from .filth diseases
this summer is to look well to his wa
ter supply ,to the safe disposal of hu
man waste, and to thoroughly screen
ing his home."
PLAT IS NECESSARY TO HEALTH.
It has been prophesied that within
the next ten or fifteen years the doc
tors will preserve a horseback ride
for his patients where he now pre
scribes a pill. It is now Veil under
stood that in order to keep in good
health one needs to be shaken up oc
casionally, and for that Teason play
becomes an important health factor.
One difference in play and work is in
work we do only what is required; in
play we do all that we can. Another
difference is. in play we want to do it;
in work we feel it a duty. In wanting
to do a thing lies half the value of do
ing it. Play becomes work when it js
done from a sense of duty.
Play is as essentia, to our health as
is work, r A man needs to have his
heart beat fast and his fXce flushed at
times. He needs often to breathe
deeply and to exert himself to the ut
most. Play does these things. Furth
ermore, play takes one out into the
open air and sunshine. It takes him
away from hip work and worry. It
trains mind along with muscle. It de
velops judgment and will power and
makes a bigger, better life. Further
more, it makes for a longer, happier
life.
Dr Woods Hutchinson. says: "Never
till we are ready to graduate from the
university of life which ought not to
be before 65 or 70, should we. cease to
regard olay as one of our major elec-
tives. Play makes the child into a
man. and keeps the man into a child,
growing and ' improving all his life
long."

information. This i3;the second plea
he has made for the information.
The Park Hill hotel, Kentucky Home
hotel and the new Carolina Terrace,
which will open July lis thought to be
ample accommodations for those who
prefer hotel service here this summer.
Hundreds of boarding houses in the
city and vicinity and the private resi
dences that take boarders will soonbe

Hendersonville is prepared for the
season and the business houses are

MR. EDMUND JONES WRITES
TO HIS CONFEDERATE COMRADS
Lenoir, N. C, May 15th, 1916.
My Dear Comrades:
On Saturday, June 3rd, 1916. there
will be a State-wide prirftary for all
State officers,and I am writing to my
old comrades of the Confederacy, ask
ing their suppo-t and influence in my
behalf, for the office of Attorney Gen
eral on the Democratic ticket.
There is a bond of sympathy be
tween those who fought together in
war, and endured hardship together in
peace, that cannot be broken or forgot
ten. Everything else being equal, I
think the "Old Boys" will stand by
each other, as they did in the past.
There were just four brothers of us.
Two laid down their lives for the Con
federacy; one at Gettysburg, and the
other at the Wilderness; the later be
ing. Lieutenant.- Colonel- of .:the .famous
26th" regiment and for whom our
camp was named.' The other two
went through to the end; and I gave
up my old enfield at Appomattox be
fore "I was seventeen years old. I
mention this to show you that Iuam
entitled to the honor of addressing
you as my "comrade." If you see fit
to give me your influence before, and
your vote at the primary, 1 shall be
grateful, and will attempt to discharge
the duties of the offlee; if elected, with
that fidelity that has ever characteriz
ed the Confederate soldier.
Of my fitness for the office, it would
not become me to speak. I leave Jnat
to Bench and Bar. I have always
been too busy to be an office seeker.
Like the rest of us, I had to give my
attention to making a living for my
self and those near .-and dear: to me.
But I never failed a help the party
as a private, at every election, by
voice, pen and purse. '
Wishing you yet many years of hap-
uihess and peace, -which you have so
abundantly earned, I am.
Sincerely and fraternally yours,
. EDMUND JONES.
P. S. I know Edmund Jones and
take this opportunity of expressing my
approval of his candidacy. I urge
every loyal Democrat to support his
on June 3. "
