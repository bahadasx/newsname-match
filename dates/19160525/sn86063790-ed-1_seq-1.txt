quite interesting to all present. The
principal, Mr. C. C. Stewart, has had
the whole school to pass rigid examinations

than exhibitions) and it

Irishman from a country village
landed in New York on his way
to live with a brother in a small
town a hundred miles or so away.
A friend put him on the train, and

at the right station.
The train, however, ran into a
freight and was wrecked. Pat was
thrown through a window and landed
on his hands and knees, but
f beyond a severe shaking up and a
few scratches was not hurt. Picking
himself up and brushing his clothes
he walked to a building some distance
away, which turned out to be
the station where he was to get out.
Pat immediately hunted up his
brother.
V , After the usual greetings were
v over, Pat was asked how he liked
f our railroad service.
"Ye, sure have some foine, com9
fortable trains," he replied, "and
they do go loike the divil, but Oi
think there could be some improvement
in the way they put ye off at
yer station."
Confidence in a Lawyer.
\
"That is my opinion. Twenty-five
dollars, please."
"I got the same opinion from an
other lawyer and he charged me $5."
"Um. You had no confidence in
him."
"No-no."
c "But you have in me?"
"Y-yes."
"Precisely. Our opinions are the
same but the difference in the cost is
$20, and to have confidence in your
case is well worth $20. This war in
1 Europe is terrible isn't it?"

DOESN'T WANT HIS SHARE.
S. O. Senator to Vote Against River
and Harbor Measure.
Washington, May 20.?"I do not
want my share of the stealing in this
bill; and while South Carolina has
items in it amounting to $300,000 I
shall vote against it and hope it will
not become law."
In these words Senator B. R. Tillman
began his remarks on the senate
floor when he arose today to say that
h? would oppose the passage of the
pending rivers and harbors bill.
"We need the money so much
more for more important things that
it is criminal in my mind to hesitate
for one moment or to discuss this bill
at all," Senator Tillman continued.
The senior senator then said that
if the bill should pass $40,000,000
would be wasted.
"I would be ashamed to go home
and tell my people that I have voted
$300,000 for South Carolina and left
unprepared and unprotected the momentous
question of a greater navy,"
he said.
Continuing his appeal for less riVer
and harbor waste and more money
for real preparedness, Senator Tillman
said that he wanted more battleships
and cruisers. He said he favored
a lump sum for river and harbor
work and did not desire to see
new surveys for waterway development
always being proposed.
"I pray 'God," Senator Tillman
said finally, "that if this bill should
pass the president, will veto it."
Getting Ahead.
There are a lot of things in thi9
world more important than money
and material prosperity, but money
and the getting of money, or the
lack of it, are matters of universal
concern. A little prosperity is essential
to the average man's happi
ness, for the average man is not a
philosopher.
All of us make a little money.
Most of us spend all we make. We
spend it all because our minds are
primitive. We are ruled by the moment's
desire, and not by the logical
conclusion that tomorrow will bring
like desires. And so it happens that,
whether we make much or little, old
age finds us as poor as we were in
youth. Then our poverty makes us
bitter, and we denounce our neighbor
whose ease and prosperity are
based on the very thrift we refused
to practice. We become Socialists
and_cuss the corporations.
Continued poverty is a personal
fault. The world is full of opportunity.
There labor for all, and
habitual labor in any field brings a
recompense that is more than sufficient
for the actual cost of existpnr.e

But he will not deny himself. He

have his tobacco and his dram.
And because he isn't man enough
to endure every necessary privation
while getting a start, he remains poor
and blames conditions and the government
for his poverty.

his wages were raised to eight

the extra three dollars, he allowed
himself a little more latitude in buying,
and even began to buy on credit.
His wages were raised to ten dollars
a week, and after that he was never
able to meet his obligations at the
store.
Poverty is a matter of carelessness.

As Pershing's Columns Retrace Steps
Northwards
Field Headquarters, Mexico, May
20.?Thirteen troopers of the 7th
cavalry were fired "tipon* yesterday
near the town of Temosachic and one
was wounded. The attack is ascribed
to bandits hiding under a bridge
near the town, which is a few miles
southeast of Madero, on the MexicoNorthwestern
railroad.
After a few shots the Mexicans fled
and the Americans continued on their
way.
A small group of Mexicans is falling
in behind the American columns
as they move northward, always
keeping out of sight, but telling the
natives that they are chasing the
"Gringoes" from Mexican soil. They
stop whenever the Americans halt
and hide or disarm if Gen. Pershing's
mPTi annrnnrh thorn
Two suppositions are prevalent regarding
the identity of these men.
One is that they are Carranzistas
trying to give the American movement
the appearance of a retreat.
The other is that they are bandits
seeking to annoy the Americans by
sniping. The latter conjecture is regarded
as the more probable.
This is the first intimation received
that American soldiers were stationed
so far to the south. All reports
have placed their southernmost
point at Namiquipa, which is a considerable
distance to the north of
Temosachic, from which it is also
separated by the Sierra Madre range.

GREAT MEMORIAL. ?
Stone Mountain to Be Transformed
Into Monument.
Atlanta, May 20.?The work of
presenting to the South a memorial
3f the War Between the States, prob- C
ably unique in design and scope, formally
was begun at Stone Mountain
here today. The mountain is a solid
block of stone and on its most
precipitous side will be carved figures
nearly forty feet in height and c
r
scenes depicting the civil war. At *
the base of the mountain directly un- a
der the gigantic figures will be blasted
out an assembly hall, in which the
reunions of the Daughters of the
Confederacy will be held. "
Some years ago the United Daughters
of the Confederacy conceived the
idea of suclf a monument and enlisted
the aid of S. E. Venable, who
owns most of the mountain. Part of
the ceremonies today was the presentation
to an officer of the Daughters
of the Confederacy by Mr. Venable a
HooH tn that nart nf the mountain on
which the huge figures will be carv- ^
ed.
While practically all of the memorial
will be cut out of solid rock,\it (
will be necessary to erect corner
posts. It was the laying of the first
block of one of these posts that occasioned
the celebration today. The
i
principal speakers announced were: f
Federal Judge Emery Speer and John
Temple- Graves. Jason Borglum, a .
sculptor, will have charge of the
work.
The central group of the historical
carvings will be a number of equestrian
figures of Lee,'Jackson, Forrest,
Johnson, Gordon, Davis and other
heroes of the Confederacy.
These figures will stand about
thirty-seven feet, according to Mr.
Borglum. He stated that the horses
would stand twenty-seven feet at the
"Withers. The group will extend for
a distance of about 3,000 feet around
the face of the mountain at a height
of slightly less than four hundred
feet above the surrounding country.
The great hall cut at the base or
the mountain will be one hundred
and eighty feet long and sixty feet
deep. It will have thirteen columns
cut from solid rock, representing
each of the thirteen Confederate
States. , In it will be stored archives
and records of the War Between the
States.
It will take about eight years to
complete the work, according to the
sculptor.

Orangeburg, May 19.?Two young
men of this county, Maxwell King and 1

while going in automobiles from this
city toward Rowesville late last night.

two miles below this city, about fifteen
minutes apart, they were fired

The authorities were notified at :

BYRNES MADDENS G. O. P.
Mann So Angry He Threatens to
"Fix" Jimmy.
? 4yjrl
Washington, May 20.?When the ?
house passed the shipping bill today
it found the Republican part of that
body mad as a March hare and -ready
to do vengeance to a member of the
South Carolina delegation, Congressman
James F. Byrnes. This came
about because Mr. Byrnes has been
v . A
most active in framing the bill in
committee and in helping to pass it
on the floor of the house.
All day yesterday the Republicans
had filibustered and were charging
"gag rule" by the Democrats.

being considered provided that a vote
should be taken at 4 o'clock on Friday.
The Republicans on Thursday
and Friday killed time in order that
when the timg for closing the debate
had arrived only a part of the bil^ would
be considered and they could
charge the Democrats with gag rule.
Mr. Byrnes had kept a record of
the time used by the Republicans and
by the Democrats and in closing the
debate for the advocates of the bill
he charged that while the Republicans
talked of gag rule they had in
fact consumed more than twice the
time consumed by the Democrats in
the discussion of the bill. It is seldom
that Minority Leader Mann loses .
his temper, but when in response to
repeated interruptions by him Mr.
Byrnes charged that Mr. Mann knew
nothing about the bill, because in- '
stead of attending to his business he
had deserted the house and gone to
the ball game, leaving some of his
assistants on the floor with instructions
to filibuster, the Republican
leader threatened the member from ; ^
South Carolina that In due time hewould
"fix him" and with the member
from the second district declar
ing his indifference to the threats of >
the Republican leader, amid applause
from the Democratic side the debate
came to a very stormy close.
It has been evident all along that
the Republicans would do anything
in their power to defeat this great
administration measure and the sitI
uation came to a climax here today,. J
as stated, when Mr. Byrnes so taunted
the G. 0. P. leaders that they lost
control of themselves entirely and
began to make threats as to what
they would do. Just how Mr. Mann
proposes to "fix" Mr. Byrnes has not
yet been disclosed and is one of the
interesting situations yet to develop.
