HEAR OTHER SIDE
CONSPIRACY CASE
New York, May 25. State Sen
ator George F. Thompson's legisla
tive committee thla afternoon heard
the other aide In Mayor Mltchel' wire
tapping conspiracy cane. The mayor
has testified that the telephone lines
of certsln Catholic churchmen were
tapped during the probe ot an alleged
plot to discredit the city administra
tion, particularly the department of
charities. iMonslgnor Dunn and
Father Farrell apieared before the
commlRulon to answer questions.
Monalgnor Dunn repudiated several
conversations the mayor read aa hav-
ling taken place with Farreli. ,Dr.
Daniel C. Potter, a former city em
ploye, characterised the reported ac
cusations as lies. He tben asserted
that the, "phonograms' 'submitted to
the commission by .Mltchel were In
the hands of the mayor and his "con
federates" for weeks before the hear
ing, and that they had been changed.
"If a man will tap a wire, he will
not hesitate to garble sentences and
read into them the meaning he de
sires," cried Potter. "Perhaps the
mayor would havo succeeded In his
purpose of taking God out of our in
stitutions and our children's Institu
tions had ho worked less speedily and
with lees ardor."
Potter scored Mltchel for trying to
make it seem that the Catholic church
was on trial In the controversy,

London, May 25. -Utter exhausr
tlon ot the human element In the
great fighting machines struggling
for mastery at Verdun brought a lull
this afternoon in the savase battle.
The frightful slaughter at Fort
Douaumont came to a halt with the
works in German hands. During the
night French troops made no effort
to wrest It from the Bavarians.
Minor .fighting proceeded today,
with slight advantage to both aides.
While the men rest in their trenches,
however, the tremendous artillery
engagement Is still raging -with ap
palling violence.
Berlin, May 25. -With the bloodi
est fighting In all history, the giant
German "nutcracker" la vlosing in
on Verdun today. Its right Jaw has
advanced on a- front of three miles
during the past seventy-two hours.
After sacrificing more than one en
tire army corps in an effort to re
tain the Dead Man's hill position,
northwest of Verdnn, the French
evacuated the whole stronghold.
Hill 304, cornerstone of the French
defense west ot the Mouse, la held
jointly by French and Germans.
Further slight advances by the Ger
mans In ravines on either side will
force Jta surrender to the right wing
of the German army. The left jaw
of the Teuton machine has entirely
re-conquered positions temporarily
surrendered to French troopB.
.It Is estimated that 30,000 men
died fighting in the dark under
ground caverns about the ruins ot
Douaumont for 72 hours, with no
resultant change in the battle line.
Positive denial is made of French
claims that General Nlvelle'a forces
ever even temporarily occupied the
ruins of Fort Douaumont. ' The only
French detachment that entered the
fort was completely wiped out, de
clared the Berlin war office,
On the southern and western ap
proaches to the fort the earth is cov
ered with countless corpses and many
wounded, crawling feebly about,
seeking shelter and aid. Since the
French attacked last Sunday there
haa been no lull in the savage strug
gle and neither side has been able to
reach Its wounded.
West of the Mouse Frenoh, troops
are being steadily driven back upon
the Verdun forts. The German cen
ter, which took Dead Man's hill, has
not yet occupied all abandoned
works, because French artillery is
still playing on Its southern ridges.

Meuse' west bank east of Cumleres
village, fighting with band grenadea,
it was officially announced ' today.
The German are strongly attacking.
They took a French trench north ot
Haudremont quarries cn the east side
of the river. Violent artillery fight
ing continued all night, but there
were no important infantry "struggles,
either around Douaumont or the
Dead, Man's hill front
me irrenon gam was made in a
small,. wood between the river and
Cumleres. The positions won would
be exposed to a German flanklnc at-
tack if French forces attemoted to
pueh on southward to Cumleres.
Southern exits to Cutnieres are under
French artillery fire, so there is no
fear of an assault from that quarter.
General NIvelle has made no at
tempt to seize Fort Douaumont dur
ing the night. Through complete ex
haustion of the infantrymen, opera
tions on both sides have temporarily
halted.
French military critics are agreed
that the week's fighting has been the
bloodiest In human history. The Ger
mans lost more men than In any of
the war's previous battles.

members of the bouse naval commit
tee today submitted to congress a re

Washington, May 25. Reversing
his decision of yesterday, Secretary
jot War Baker announced today he
'would call a courtmartlai to try the
I cases of 116 Texas militiamen
charged with tailing to present them
selves for border duty.
Baker's reversal was due to the
discovery of the legal points in the
new army bill which would not ob
viate the oath required -of the Texas
militiamen that they defend the con
stitution and obey the orders of the
Texas governor. , . . , ,
No mention was made of fealty to
the president's order. -
Under these circumstances, Judge
Advocate General Crowder believes
the new army bill does not render
the militia law void. The offense ot
failure to present themselves at mus
ter Is not wiped out. The validity
of their reasons tor so doing will be
decided at the courtmartlai.
