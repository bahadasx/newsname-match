Denounce $241,000,000 Naval i
Appropriation Bill as Wholly j
Inadequate
W A N T DREADNAUGHTS
Urge More Battle Cruisers; j
Full Number o£ Men and
Greater Speed in Building
By Associated Press
Washington, May 25. Republican
members of the House Naval Affairs
Committee in a minority report sub- J
mitted to the House to-day denounced
the $241,000,000 naval appropriation'
bill reported by the majority as wholly i
inadequate and urged more liberal al
lowance to make the United States
Navy second greatest in the world.
The minority charged that the ma
jority report ignored opinions of naval
experts and recommendations of
Secretary Daniels and was based on a
compromise between interests which
wanted no additional naval protec
tion and those which wanted only a
slight increase.
Want More Speed
The Republicans recommended that!
the bill provide for two dreadnaughts;
omitted by the reported measure, six |
battle cruisers instead of five, fifty j
coast defense submarines instead of'
twenty, $3,500,000 for aircraft in
stead of $2,000,000, still greater In
crease in personnel, creation of a na
tional defense council, and means for
rushing the building program by using
more than one shift of workmen 1
daily.
Ask For Dreadnaughts
The report suggested that the two j
dreadnaughts be built according to i
plans now ready for the California I
and Tennessee, so that all might I>o j
finished simultaneously. The bill,
should provide, the report declared
for the full number of men required
on a peace basis, and should authorize]
the President to order at his discretion
enlistment of such additional men as 1
the navy might need, not to exceed
the 38.7H2 recommended by the gen
eral board.
"We have 72 submarines built and
building." said the minority report. ;
"The lowest estimate of our require
ments by any naval authority is 150."]
The general board advised expendi
ture of $7,000,000 on the aeronautical
service, the report pointed out. Com- i
menting on the proposal for a defense '
council, it said:
"Experience in modern wars has
all other great nations to establish
such a council to insure unity, con-;
tinuity and co-operation in art j
branches of national defense."
The minority declared the omission!
of dreadnaughts in the reported hill :
"will further increase the existing
shortage of powerful fighting ships of j
the dreadnaught type."

Continuing their furious assaults tn
the Verdun region the Germans hav

battered ruins of Fort Douaumont
from the French, have driven hard
against the lines west of the fort. In
this new attack the crown prince's
forces succeeded in gaining a foothold
in a French trench near the Haudde
mont quarry which has been the
scene recently of much hard fighting.
At Fort Douaumont itself infantry
engagements waged so desperately
during the early part of the week
have ceased for the time being accord
ing to the afternoon bulletin of the
French war office.
The artillery is still notably active.
