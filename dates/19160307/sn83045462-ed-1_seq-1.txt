IU. S. Supreme Court Decides
as to Premium System in
Merchandise Sales. P
The I'nited States Supreme Court yesterday
afternoon held that states have the
power to tax trade coupons redeemable in
premiums. It is estimated that $125.- j
I <>00,000 of merchandise is sold annually | _
J in this way. I
j The court upheld the constitutionality
.c*ws> ?n r 10. a., |
posing: such taxes, and dismissed the ap- j
peal of F. S. Pitney of Seattle, "Wash., i
convicted of violating the Washington j1
trading stamp law, in that he as manager
and agent of the United Cigar Stores ]
Company in connection with a sale to a .
customer gave a trading stamp or coupon. !
The court's decision was delivered by j
Justice McKenna and was based largely)
on the Florida statute, with the comment J B
I that the validity of the Washington law ?
, was established on the same principles, j ^
Explains the Statute.
| Justice McKenna pointed out that ;
j the statute was directed toward "cou- j
i pons redeemable in premiums" and j
i therefore that in its decision the court
expressly reserved any opinion as to j
I the constitutionality of a law aimed at ;
the redemption by the giving of a discount
or an allowance of credit on account.
He said the schemes at which
the law was aimed were all based on
local- sales, and upon local sales the
license tax provided for in the law was
imposed. This took the transaction out
of the protection of the interstate commerce
law. he said.
In considering whether the law inter
fered with the business liberty of mer- j
chants, .Justice McKenna paid his re- j
spects to the large number of courts j
which had held such laws to be an "il- J
legal meddling with a lawful calling
i and a deprivation of freedom of con- j
[ tract." He spoke of decisions holding
such premium systems to be mere bl
j methods of discount, and concluded .
I that with this difference of opinion in V
i the courts a legislature which acted , ,
i on the subject matter would Dot be
held to have acted arbitrarily?in which v
case only the Supreme Court could annul
the statute. ^
Broad Power of Legislature. b;
"But no refinement of reason is nec- ^
essary to demonstrate the broad power
of the legislature over the trans- K
actions of men/* said Justice McKenna.
"There are many lawful restrictions upon
liberty of contract and business. It ^
would be an endless task to cite cases
in demonstration, and that the sup- \;
plementing of the sale of one article
by a token given and to be redeemed hi
in ome other article has accompaniments
and effects beyond mere advertising.
the allegations of the* bill
and the argument of counsel establish.
"The schemes of complainants have m
no such directness and effect. They aa
rely upon something else than the article
sold. They tempt by a promise of '
a value greater than that article, and
apparently not represented fn its
price, and it hence may be thought that ci,
thus, by an appeal to cupidity, lure to
improviaence. mis may noi oe cauea re
in an exact sense a 'lottery.' may not
be called 'gaming': it may, however, be
considered as having the seduction and ba
evil of such, and whether it has may
be a matter of inquiry and of judg- of
ment that it is finally within the power
of the legislature to make." M

TO MILITIA DUTY
- ?
Corporation Counsel Holds
Valid the Law of 1889 Requiring
Enrollment.
1 i
Enrollment in the District militia
of every male citizen of Washington
between the ages of
eighteen and fortv-tive years, except
such as are exempted from
military service, is expected to
follow speedily the rendering today
of an opinion by Corporation
Counsel Conrad 11. Synie, which
holds to be still in effect the act
of March i. 1889, requiring such
compulsory enrollment.
The opinion has not gone to the Commissioners
and may not be acted upon
before the latter part of the week. The
District heads will be called upon to
rletermine whether they have the facilities
for compl\ing immediately with the
ia w.
Cen. Harvey, commanding general of
the District militia, directed the Commissioners'
Attention to the act in question
and since then Mr. Symc has been
making: an investigation of congressional
enactments to jj^termine whether it is
in force still.
Reviews Militia Legislation.
His opinion, covering five typewritten
pages, reviews the history of the District
militia legislation. The act of
February 18. 1909. for the organization
if the militia of the District, specifically
recognizes the prior act of March 1. <
ISS9. as being in full force and effect,
le says, "it leaves untouched and ununended
the first nine sections of the
atter act," lie concludes, "and. thereore.
'eaves in full force and effect
hos?- sections which provide for the !
Miro'.'ment of the able-bodied male citi- :
sens resident within the District of Co- :
umbia. who are of military age and 1
not specifically exempted under the ,
erms of the act."
1
Effect of Law Discussed. ,
When Corporation Counsel Syme was
asked as to the effect of the enforce- !
ment of the act. he said: '
"All male citizens, between the ages *
r?f eighteen and forty-five years, with '
certain exceptions, are subject to milllary
service finder the terms of the i
art. It contemplates that a list of all i
such persons shall he made by the
Commissioners of tne District of Co- ,
lunibia who may require the assessors of I
taxes to make it. A copy of the list,
when made, the law requires to be fur- I
iii.shed the commanding general of the
militia. This enrolled militia is not
subject to any duty except when it is
ailed into the service or the United
states or to aid the civil authorities in
the execution of the laws or the suppression
of riots.
Power of Commander-in-Chief.
"Under such conditions the comnander-in-cliief
is empowered to order
nit. by draft or otherwise, or to accept
,s volunteers, as many of the enrolled'
nilitia as may he required. and the persons
thus called are to he mustered in
he service for such period as may be
lecessarv. and/ the commanding: gen>ra!
may assign thein to existing organizations
of the militia or may organize
them separately.
"The practical effect of the act is
o have available a list of all persons
tubject to military duty in the District;
Lhe making of such a list is notice to
ihem of their enrollment, and They may
*e called into service, under tne conditions
I have named."

When the agitation is finally disposeof
the President and Secretary Lansinj

In quick succession today the Hous
rejected the proposal to allow anti
administration amendments to the Mc

special rule for consideration o
the resolution itself, routing the op
position by votes of 2f?6 to 160 an

Immediately after the adoption o
the rule, diebate began on the resolu

House Attentive to Debate.
The House listened with great at
ten tion to the short debates, and th
few members who sought to interrup
speakers were asked by other member
to be seated.
The preliminary little, in which th
republicans pleaded earnestly that tli>
House be allowed to amend the Mc

on a simple resolution to "warn Ameri

travely on armed merchant* vessels o
the warring nations, was partly in th<
nature of a parliamentary discussion
partly a> condensed forecast of wha
the longer speech-making array of thlate

There was scarcely any difference ir
the volumes of tone in the first "vivs

as the "noes."
During the debate Representatm

that he would support the President ii

| Reminder From Mr. Gardner.
1 He was followed by Representative
> Gardner of Massachusetts. Speaking in
9 democratic time he reminded the House
i that the fight is entirely on the first vote
| ?the vote on the "previous question"?
, that the fight is to throw the whole disi
cussion in the committee of the whole
House, where .there is no record of votes
1 kept. ,
Representative Bennett of New York, a
republican, relieved the suppressed ten- ,
. j sion for a moment by raising a laugh at
. I Representative Gardner's expense.
.j "He is never cowardly, but frequently
I ; wrong." said Representative Bennett. He
II then declared the rule is not a fair one.
} j that it did not allow all sides of the mat-/
* ' ter to be voted on.
- thank God that Woodrow Wilson Is
the President of the United States."
said Representative C&ntrell of Ken1
tucky, as he reiterated a denial of the
5 charge that the President "wants war."
"The question is. Shall the House
1 stand by the President or desert hini
in the hour of need? I propose lo
stand by the President until the end.
for in doing so i will best serve my
, J country."
For Opinion on Real Merits.
[ j Representative l.enroot of Wisconsin
1 said the House should so vote as to
omain an expression or opinion on the
real merits of the question of Anierl- *1
cans traveling: on armed ships.
He said the McLemore resolution
and the motion to table it is not the
way to comply with the President s request.
He urged that the fullest opportunity
be g:iven to amend the McLemore
resolution, so that the real
warning: may be Riven.
"If you vote against amending the
McLemore resolution you will not be
voting for a chance to express yourselves."
he said, and explained that ff
trouble arises those who fail to vote
for an amendment will be sorry that
they were denied the right to say exactly
where they stood. The greatest
applause offered up to that time was
' accorded Mr. Lenroot.
