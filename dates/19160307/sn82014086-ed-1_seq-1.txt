the Verdun region and in Champagne
are told in the latest French official
communication, which, however, also
records successes in repelling a Ger
man attempt to debouch further from a
captured position, the driving of the
.Teutons out of a trench they had
taken and the hammering with their
:big gun3 of German organization.
; Germans Capture Forges.
After having vigorously shelled the
region between Bethincourt and the
Meuse, the Germans in a strong in
fantry attack captured the village of
Forges, about nine miles northwest of
Verdun. Not satisfied with the gain,
they several times essayed to debouch
from the village against the Cote de
l'Oie. but the French in counter-at
tacks forced them back to the village
and held them there.
In Champagne the right and left
flanks of the French were attacked by
the Germans in the region between
Mont Tetu and Maisons de Champagne.
At the former point the French fire
kept the Germans to their trenches, but
near Maisons de Champagne they suc
ceeded in occupying a small section of
a French trench.
French Blow Up German Post.
In the Argonne the French blew up
near Courtes Chausses a German post
with a mine and captured a portion of
the crater. Near Haute Chavauchee
the Germans sprung two mines and
later entered the French trenches at
several points. Counter-attacks, how-
also occupied a portion of the mine
crater.
Except for the infantry attacks at
Forges, the guns on both sides In the
Verdun region have been doing all the
work. Southwest of Metz, near Pont-a-Mousson,
the French artillery has
heavily damaged German positions.
Russians Land on Black Sea Coast.
The Russians under cover of the fire
of their fleet at last have been able to
make a landing on the Black sea coast
east of Trebizond, capturing the towns
of Atina and Maprava and driving off
the Turks who opposed them. Two
officers and 280 men were made pris
oner and two guns and a quantity of
munitions were captured.
Considerable fighting between the
Russians and the Germans has taken
place in northwest Russia, the Russian
artillery smashing German trenches in
the Riga sector and dispersing scout
ing parties in the vicinity of Friedrich
stadt. Owing to the heavy rains and
avalanches, fighting has almost ceased
on the Austro-Italian front .
Berlin reports that in the Zeppelin
raid over England Sunday night th
Hull naval depot was bombed with
effect. All the German aircraft return
ed safely. British official reports say
that Yorkshire. Lincolnshire, Rutland,
Huntingdon. Cambridgeshire, Norfolk,
Bssex and Kent counties were visited.
Three men, four women and five chil
dren were killed by the bombs dropped
and 33 other persons were injured.
Washington, March 6. On the eve
of what friends of the administration
have planned as the final fight to end
agitation in the house over the ques
tion of armed merchant ships, debate
on the subject broke out in the house
late today and continued hotly for
more than an hour. When It was over
there seemed to be more of a partisan
alignment than at any time since the
Issue arose.
Representative Mann of Illinois, the
republican leader, and Representative
Lienroot of Wisoensin. republican
member of the rules committee, gave
notice that they would oppose tomor
row the rule under which It Is pro
posed to table the McLemore warning
resolution after ninety minutes of de
bate on the rule and four hours" dis
cussion of the resolution itself.
On the other hand. Chairman Flood
of the foreign affairs committee, who
has been understood previously to fa
vor a warning resolution, voiced an
aippeal to all patriotic congressmen to
stand by the president.
Realizing the task ahead of them,
the administration whips sent out calls
to all absent democrats within reach
to hurry to Washington in time for
the vote tomorrow. The president's
supporters believe that a large ma
jority of democrats as well as many
republicans will stand together to put
through the rule and kill the McLe
more resolution. There will be for
midable opposition both in and out of
the party, however, and the influence
of William Jennings Bryan is being
taken into account to be dealt with.

Agonizing Cries of Victims Heard
by a Great Crowd Outside the Jail.
El Paso, Tex., March 6. Nine pris
oners were burned to death and prob
ably 40 others were seriously injured,
many fatally, when fire, starting from
large tubs containing a solution of
gasoline and kerosene, used to exter
minate vermin, exploded in the city
jail today. Many of the victims were
thoroughly saturated with the solution
when the flames enveloped them, and
their cries of agony were heard by a
great crowd which had assembled out
side of the jail.
In their first reports Jail officials at
tributed the origin of the fire to the
deliberate act of a prisoner in throw
ing a lighted match into one of the
containers holding the explosive fluid.
Unable to Escape Sheet of Flame.
Surrounding the bath quarters are
rows of cells, and it was in these that
most of the fatalities occurred. Locked
in, the prisoners were unable to escape
the blinding sheet of flame. Those who
were rescued were found insensible and
terribly burned.
Fifty Prisoners Taken Out Unharmed.
About 50 prisoners were taken out
unharmed and placed in quarters re
moved from the bath house under
heavy guard. The fire department,
quartered in the same building, quick
ly extinguished the fire and with the
assistance of five physicians gave aid
to the burned victims. Mayor Lea has
ordered an investigation.

GERMAN AIR RAID ON
ENGLAND DURING SNOWSTORM
Three Zeppelins Caused 45 Casualties
Sunday Night.
London, March 7, 1.42 a. m. The
three German air raiders cased 45
casualties Sunday night, according to
reports received up to midnight. The
three Zeppelins separated on their ar
rival on the English coast and they
wandered about over eight counties,
but virtually all the damage was done
In one Yorkshire town.
Reports from other parts of the raid
ed territory speak of the Zeppelins re
maining stationary at comparatively
low altitudes. All three of them seem
ed to have lost their bearings owing
to the bad weather conditions.
At a town on the southern coast a
Zeppelin was observed hastening home
ward with its nose down, as if disabled
severely. The German official report
says that all the raiders returned
safely.
Sunday's raid proved two things to
the British public first, that snow
storms are no hindrance to the Ger
rna naircraft, and second that the pub
lic warnings which are given in ad
vance to most of the districts visited
do not lead to panic, but probably less
en the casualties. The snow was fall
ing heavily when the raiders arrived,
but some experts believe that they flew
above the snow clouds during the
greater part of their visit.
One airship passed over the county
of Cambridgeshire a half hour after
midnight, but no hombs were dropped.
A correspondent in Kent telegraphs
that only one airship visited the Kent
ish coast, approaching direct from the
sea. The pilot, evidently, had no ac
curate idea, of his whereabouts, for
only three bombs were dropped. All
the bombs fell in a mnrsh.
PREFERENTIAL PRIMARY
IN INDIANA TODAY.
Candidates For Higher Offices Have
Conducted Heated Campaign.
."Washington, March 6. Rev. James
Cannon. Jr.. of Virginia, chairman of
the legislative committee of the Anti
Saloon league of America, protested
against confirmation of Louis D. Bran
deis' nomination to the supreme court
today before the senate investigating
committee, because of statements made
by Mr. Brandeis in 1891, when he was
counsel for the Protective Liquor
Dealers' association and the New Eng
land Brewers' association, before the
Massachusetts legislature.
Senator Chilton suggested that this
incident occurred 25 years ago and
that there was quite a difference be
tween the public attitude toward the
liquor interests then and today. Dr.
Cannon insisted, however, that Mr.
Brandeis' public utterances had failed
to show any change in his position. He
said the objection was not based so
much on the fact that Mr. Brandeis
appeared for the liouor interests and
opposed pending legislation as on the
sweeping statement he made about the
liquor traffic in his arguments. Par
tioular attention was directed to cer
tain quoted statements, one of them
to the effect that liquor dealing was
not wrong.
Dr. Cannon submitted photographic
copies of the records of the Massachu
setts legislative committee, including
an argument by Mr. Brandeis.
CONSIDERATION OF GERMANY'S
SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN
Col. House is Understood to Have
Told Secretary Lansing Germany
Feels Justified.
Indianapolis, Ind., March 6. Nu
merous meetings conducted tonight by
the candidates for the higher offices
closed one of the most heated cam
paigns in the history of Hossier poli
tics and the voters tomorrow will ex
press their preferences in the first
htate-wide preferential primary to be
held in Indiana. It will be the first
primary of the 1916 presidential cam
paign in which candidates for the
nomination for president will be voted
upon.
Although President "Wilson is with-
out oposition for renomination on the
democratic ticket and Former "Vice
President Charles W. Fairbanks is the
only candidate for the republican
nomination on the Indiana ballot,
much interest throughout the country
is heing attached to the vote.
The only contest of more than local
interest in the democratic ranks is
that betwen Congressman John A.
Marair an "Leonard B. Core, for the
gVbernatorial nomination. Three can
didates seeking the republican nomin
ation for United States senator and
three working hard for the nomination
for governor have aroused deep inter
est in the primary among the republi
cans. As the ballots are very long and the
voters are expected to express their
first and second choice for each of
fice, it will be late before anything like
definite returns can be had and it may
bo two or three days before the out
come of some of the contests will be
made known.
STREET TRAFFIC SERIOUSLY
INTERRUPTED BY STORM.

New York. March 6. Steamship
movements and street traffic here were
seriously interrupted today by a heavy
snowstorm. The weather bureau re
ported that four inches ho. J fallen and
added that this probably would be In
creased to six inches by tomorrow
morning.
A call was issued by the city tonight
for 40,000 men to clear the snow from
the streets. No serious damare to
property has been reported, however.
Railroad traffic, according to offieinls,
remained almost normal, but many in
coming steamships were held in the
grip of the storm and were forced to
anchor down the bay. Among these
were the Kristianaf iord from Bertren.
the Stockholm from Gothenburg and
the Sixaolala from Havana.
None of the Lonf Island sound boats
left their piers at sailing time and It

Washington, March 6. With the ap
pendices to Germany's declaration of
the new submarine campaign against
armed merchant ships of her enemies
before it, the administration is prepar
ing to determine the next move of the
United States in the negotiations with
the central European powers. Accord
ing to present plans diplomatic nego
tiatlons on the subject are to follow a
settlement of the controversy In con
gress. Because of tbe- necessity of trans
lating some of the documents append
ed to the German declaration, Secre
tary Lansing and President "Wilson
have not yet had an opportunity to
consider them in their entirety. AH
the documents probably will be ready
for their perusal tomorrow.
Colonel E. M.. House, who returned
from Europe yesterday after visitinc"in
lyondon, Paris and Berlin for Presidon
Wilson, is understood to have told the
president and Secretary Lansing to
day that the German government be
lieved Itself justified in its new sub
marine policy and was not bluffing.
Colonel House is believed to hav
strengthened the view already held bv
both the president and Secretary
Lansing that the submarine negotia
tions must be handled with the great
est care if a break with Germany i?
to be avoided, although he reported
that Germany had no desire fur war
vith the United States. He di-euss-d

Devon. Conn.. March 6. J. F. Orr. a
Bridgeport trolley conductor, was shot
out not seriously wounded, by an un
known highwayman who had robbed
him of his small change at the east
end of the Washington bridge near
here late today.
Robber Made His Escape.
The robber made his escape. Ac
cording to Chief of Police Maher. the
description of the man tnat Orr gave
tallies closely with that of the rob
ber who earlier in the day held up at
the point of a revolver a clerk in
New Haven store. T. he autnoruies
are r.ow scouring the surrounding
country for the man.
Ordered to Turn Over Money,
According to Information given out
by Superintendent Chapman of the
trolley company, the highwayman
boarded the car at Devon Corner, the
trolley being an extra bound for
Stratford. There were no rassengers
on the car at the time. When Con
ductcr Orr went up to the man and
asked for his fare, the robber drew
evolver and ordered him to turn over
bin money. Orr pave the man all
the loose change he had in his pockota
and also turned over his watch.
Tried to Grab Revolver.
Orr, evidently thinking he had an
opportunity to wrest the revolver from
the man, grabbed his arm and a hand
to-hand fight ensued, during which,
is o'aimed, the gun was accidntly dis
charged, the bullet lodging in the hip.
Second Shot Went Wild.
Another shot was fired, but the bul
let went wide. oMtorman M'jrphT
of Bridgeport, hearing the shots,
brought his car to a stop about the
same time the robber jumped irom
the car and disappeared. The man
ran in the direction or a moving
freight train on the Berkshire division
of the New Haven road and it is
thought he stole a ride, taking him
far away from the scene in a few
minutes.
Wound Not Serious.
Orr was taken to the office of Dr. J.
F. Pons and given medical treatment.
Later he was taken to the Brldgeort
hospital, where it was said that his
condition was r.ot serious.

Proposition to Cut Down Free Storage
Time Allowed Another to Cut Off
Shipments to New York for Export.
Washington. March C nr.-
the freight congestion which has tied
up eastern trunk line railroads despite
v.ic irairrcugni on export traffic and
some of the remedies which may be
used to correct this condition were
discussed today before the Interstate
Commerce Commission by representa
tives oi tne interested carriers, ship
pers and receivers of freight.
Seaports Affected.
Although the discussion dealt al
most exclusively with conditions at
New York, it was pointed out thac
Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore an-1
other seaports probably would be af
fected by any changes made in the
rules and regulations of carriers. Tho
hearing, or conference, will continue
tomorrow.
The railroad representatives offered
a resolution for the consideration of
of the commission proposing to cut
down the free storage time allowed ou
freight in terminals and increase tho
demurrage charges on cars not un
loaded after a fixed period of free
time allowed for this purpose. The
shippers and receivers of freight op
posed this plan in a resolution declar
ing it to be their belief that such
measures would not relieve congestion,
but would add burdens to the public.
Many Reasons Assigned.
Many reasons were assigned for the
piling up of fre'.eht in the seaboard
cities, but there was no agreement ou
this point. The large export traffic,
the desire of the carriers and others
to obtain large supplies of coal in
fear that there may be a coal strike
next montn and the lack of sufficient
track facilities around New York and
of lighters in New York harbor around
New York and of lighters in New

In Seven Out of the Ten City Elections
Held Yesterday.
Portland, Me., March 6. Republican
mayoralty candidates were successful
In seven out of the ten city elections
held in Maine today. Colonel Freder
ick E. Boothby, former republican
mayor of Portland, was elected mayor
of Waterville, his present home, by a
margin of only two votes over his
democratic opponent. There will be a
recount. Other republican mayors
elected are Henry R. Porter at Auburn,
Fred T. Eldridge at Eastport, Alexan
der C. Hagerty at Ellsworth, John M.
Robinson at Hallow eil, James H. Hen
derson at Saco and Charles E. West at
South Portland. The successful demo
cratic candidates are John A. Small at
Bath, Louis J. Brann at Lewiston and
Frank C. Flint at Rockland. The suc
cess or the republicans in wresting
control of Hallowell from the demo
crats was offset by the victory of the
democrats over last year's republican
administration in Rockland.
