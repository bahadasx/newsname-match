BIG VAULT IS OPEN
Kansas Able to Handle Her 21
Millions Today.
Sledcre Hammer Necessary to
Work Time Lock.
Kansas resumed business in the
state treasurer's office this morning,
following the opening Monday night
of the big vault in the office of Karl
Akers, state treasurer. The clock
which operates the time lock of the
vault, stopped running sometime be
tween Saturday night and Monday
morning. The dials were started when
workmen struck the vault door with
slerige hammers.
When Treasurer Akers attempted
to open the doors of the big fire and
burglar proof vault Monday morning,
he found that the time lock had not
respond od and that the doors could
not bo opened. A test with a stetho
scope showed that the clock had
stopped running A similar situation
had confronted the state during the
Tom Kelly administration. At that
time the clock was started from vi
brations of a battering ram used on
the door of the big vault. A similar
method was used Monday night.
All of the records of the state treas
urer's office were locked in the giant
vault. With the books and office fil s
were bonds and securities amounting
to 21 million dollars. That the treas
urer's troubles might give real con
cern, Akers pointed to the fact that
he had just begun his annual inven
tory of the state's assets. The work
could not be completed until the nil
was opened
: lad the battering ram process
failed to produce results, state offi
cials planned to send to the Lansing
state penitentiary for expert yeggmon
who would have been given an oppor
tunity to demonstrate their ability.
An examination today failed to revial
defects in the vault. Failure of the
strong box to respond was the third
accident of the kind in'15 years.

Robert Pasre to Retire Because !
I
He Differs With Wilson.
Carolina Solon Believes Presi

Washington. March 7. Represents- !
tive Robert X. Page, of North Caro
liana, has sent a letter to his constitu
ents stating that, inasmuch as he dif
fered with President Wilson on the !
armed merchantmen issue, he could
not accept a Oemocratic renomination.
He expressed the belief that the presi
dent's course will lead inevitably to
war.
"I feel that the president shifted a
responsibility when he asked congress
to pass on this warning resolution.' ,
Mr. Page said. "If he had chosen to
pass on it himself. I should not have I
criticised his decision, though I might
not have agreed with him. Then he
would have exercised an executive
function that was his own affair.
For Warning Resolution.
"But when he asked congress to
pass on the issue then I had my own :
conscience to consider. I am for a
warning resolution."
The action of Representative Page
caused a stir in official quarters, not
only because of political considera
tions but also for the reason that he
Is a brother of Walter H. Page, Amer
ican ambassador to Great Britain. It
was further construed as an indica-
I tion of a deep undercurrent among
j Democratic congressmen to resist the ;
I efforts of the president to "force a '
vote of confidence in his course.
Representative Page was elected to
the Fifty-eighth congrese and has rep
resented the Seventh district of North
Carolina in the house ever since. He;
had no opposition to his candidacy for
the nomination last time.
Reports today were that other
southern congressman planned to fol
low Page's example, but they could
not be confirmed.

Sunday Evening's Party Leaks
Into Limelight Today.
NINE MEN AND WOMEN THERE
Several, Admitting They Were
Married, Begged Release.
Gong in Hall Warned Inmates a
Little Too Late.
Unless they figure that the money
they put up for bonds Sunday night
was well spent, nine men and women
will be in police court late this after
noon, eight to answer to the charge of
being "found in" and one to answei
to the charge of maintaining a dis
orderly house. They were all gather
ed in by the police in a raid executed
Sunday night at 305 East Eighth
street, a rooming house operated by
Mrs. F. D. Elba.
The defendants in the case are Mrs. ,
Elbs, keeper, who was released on a j
$100 bond, and Fai Moore, Iida Baird, j
Edith Carter, Eouise Jones, James
Fay, J. C Johnson, Frank Hall and 1
E. Hannon- all released on $10 bonds.
According to the police it was
"some"' raid. Officers Sauls, McGov- i
em, Hobsun, Woodward and Porter
were assigned to it- Sauls was first j
at the front door. It has a glass panel j
and when Mrs. Elbs saw the police
on the porch she Cammed it shut and i
reached for a button high on the
casing. A gong located somewhere in j
the upper regions broke loose and a
moment later a stampede oi numan
beings broke loos.
The police forced their way in and
spread out over the house. The up
stairs rooms were nearly all occupied
and they found found men and wom
en in various stages of attire. Girls
flitted through the hails. Men were
attempting to get their feet through
armholea in their coats and doi ng
various other things, indicating they
were not calm and collected.
Four W ere Released.
"There were four men in the place
occupying rooms alone," said Chief
Parsons today, "and we did not bring
them to the station. However, one of
them admitted to us yesterday that he
had an engagement with a girl there
and that she had not arrived when the
police made their call."
There was much protesting by men
! and women when the police an-
i.-nounoea tnat tne crowd would be
taken to the station. They gave vari
ous explanations for their presence,
but the explanations didn't go. Vari
ous' occupants of the rooms maintain
ed that they were staid married cou
ples and were indignant over police
intervention. But the police were
armed with information gained in ad
vance and insisted upon taking the
whole crowd to the police station.
Everyone in the party was turned
loose. Bonds were forthcoming in
every instance. Police officials are
wondering just how many of the in
mates will appear this afternoon to
answer the charges against them.
"We have been watching this place
for some time." said Chief Parsons,
"and could have raided it numerous
times and caught two or three couples.
But we waited for a full house and
landed at the right time."

HOGS ARE SOARING
ot a Case of Pigrs Flying, How
ever; It's the Price.
A European ation Buys 2-"
Million Pounds Bacon.
Chicago. March 7. Pork prices are
soaring again. Market experts pre
dict the high price records will be
smashed within a month.
From the lowest price in years, due
to record breaking receipts, hogs have
advanced to the highest mark in two
years, with constantly dwindling re
ceipts. The market rose an average
of a dollar in January and another
dollar in February, and recently hit
the $9 mark.
This condition, market experts say,
is due to sever! causes. Principally,
farmers have been unable to save
their pigs for fattening because the
corn in the hog belt has been "soft.'
Consequently they shipped so many
young to the markets late in 1915 that
fat hogs will be mostly among the
missing in April and May, their
heavy months for delivery.
The European governments have
recently learned, it is said, that pork
is a more economical and compact
tood than beef for their armies. One
nation has recently completed the
purchase of a 25,000,000 pound bacon
order.

Washington, March 7. President
Wilson's stand that congress shall not
advise Americans to abandon their
rights to travel the seas on merchant
ships armed for defense in accordance
with international law, was endorsed
in the house today by two heavy tet
votes on the much discussed McLe
more resolution. By substantial na
joritit s the administration forces de
feated attempts to amend the resolu
tion to the liking of the president's op
ponents, and put it squarely before
the house without amendment for a
vote under a special rule at the end
of four hours debate.
About 6 o'clock this evening the ad
ministration fore s will move to table
the McLemore resolution and i he
heavy votes they polled in the two
preliminary tests indicate that thev
will kill it by a substantial majority.
Once tabled, the resolution will have
gone the way of th Gore resolution
in the senate, and a majority of con
gress will have been placed on record
before t ne world as demonstrating:
t hat it does not endorse the dissen
sions against the president's foreign
policy. With the agitation finally die

In quick succession today the house
rejected the proposa1 to allow anti-administration
amendments to the Mc
Lemore resolution and then adopt the
special rule for consideration of the
resolution itself, routing the opposi
tion by votes of 256 to 160 ami J71
