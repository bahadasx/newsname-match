amendment, for a vote under a special
rule at the end of four hours' debate.

ary tests indicate they will kill it by a
substantial majority.

iiNERS GRANTED
WAGE INCREASE
Action of Operators it is Believed Will
Cost Them $8,000,000 Annually
: "in Production.
New York, March 7. Miners of the
bituminous coal fields o the middle
west today are elated over the grant
ing of increases in wages estimated ai
about '$8,000,000 a year. To what ex
tent the public will figure in the high
cost of producing coal it is too early
to say. It is known, however, that tho
United States Steel corporation, which
takes a considerable amount of the
tonnage of the Pittsburgh. Coal com
pany, the largest soft coal company iu
the country, will pay the advance on
the coal it purchased from that con
cern, as it has a contract pledging to
pay whatever increase the Pittsburgh
company has to give to labor. Other
companies, it is said, have similar
contracts.
If adopted, the new wage scale will
go into effect April 1. The increase in
pay ranges from 3 to 5.39 cents a ton
for piece work. An advance of five
per cent in wages paid by the day or
on dead work and yardage is res,
ommended by the subcommittee.
The new scale in Illinois is, machine
work 54 cents; pick 64 cents.
The miners' demands for an eight
hour day, weekly payday., and an idle
day every other Saturday were not
approved by the subcommittee.

Man of Starting Blaze J
He Is Dead.
.El Paso, Texas, March 7. H. M.
Cross of Davenport, Iowa, is named in
a statement by H. C. Bagby, a jail i
trusty as the man who was seen to i
light the match which is believed to )
have caused the explosion yesterday;
in the disinfection bath room of the i
city jail which caused IS deaths. More
than 40 prisoners were in the bath ,
room when the explosion occurred and '
nearly all of them suffered serious
burns, nine dying within a short time.
Cross was one of the first to die. Nine
others who were taken to hospitals
died during the night. Twelve Amer-,
leans, were among those burned, two
of them having died. i
A lighted match ignited the vapors
arising from the mixture of gasoline,
kerosene and vinegar, in which the
prisoners, mostly Mexicans, were be-
ing bathed in conformity with sanitary .
measures devised by city health au
thorities to prevent the spread of dis-'
ease from Mexican arrivals. Sheets of
flame flashed through the entire east
wing of the prison and almost immed- ..
iately the street fronting the jail was
filled with naked, shrieking men, en
veloped in fire.
A fire company housed In the jail
building extinguished the flames.
The coroner's inquest and an in
vestigation by city officials, ordered
for today, had to do principally -with 1
statements made by guards and sur- .
vivors, who declared that the explos-.
ion was caused by the lighting of a
match by one of the prisoners. , '
While the investigation was pro- .
ceeding on this side of the boundary, .
civil and military at Juarez, opposite .
here were prosecuting a search for an
unidentified Mexican who boarded a -street
car near the Juarez race track
and shot the motorman, Charles
Phelps last night after a report was
spread that 200 Mexicans had been
thrown into jail here and deliberately
burned to death. Phelps is said to be ;
fatally wounded. Car service between :
El Paso and Juarez, which was sus- ,
pended last night, was resumed today.
The report that the explosion was
the result of deliberate intention on'
the part of Americans to kill Mexi
cans was not long in spreading over
Juarez. Geat excitement prevailed in
the Mexican town and heavy military
patrols were sent out by General
Gavira, to suppress disorder. Eighteen '
Americans, all employes of the race
track, were on board the car at the '
time of the shooting and all fled to the
brush.
H. M. Cross is not known to Daven
