TASK A FRUITLESS ONE
To Find Candidate Against Helm,
Says Danville Paper.
(From Danville Messenger)
After a faithful search for some
one to announce as a canddate
against Hon. Harvey Helm for the
Democratic nomination for Congress,
the small bunch of men who hold per
sonal grievances against the Lincoln
county man have found their task a
fruitless one. Disappointed in this,
they are now busily engaged in belit-
itling Mr. Helm and doing all in their
I power to hurt his candidacy. About
he .most ' contemptible act in politics
is that of throwing mud at the lei-
low who has won his spurs honestly
and above board. That he is one of
the most popuar men in the district,
his several wonderful races will at
test, and that he is going to be the
next nominee is a foregone conclu
sion. The Messenger has championed
Mr. Helm's cause since this paper
was established six years ago. We
have done this because it has been
our earnest effort to support only
men we know are qualified for the of
fice sought; men whose Democracy
cannot be questioned; men who are
capable and fearless in performance
of duty, and whose personal charac
ter is absolutely above reproach. In
Mr. Helm the Democrats have such a
man.
The Congressional Record will
show that Mr. Helm has been con
stantly at his post of duty and always
voted and worked for every question
he believed to be right and proper.
He has done all any man can do in
the interest of his constituents, many
of whom have been beneficiaries in
matters of valuable, consideration. It
was Mr. Helm who secured the pass
age through the House of the many
old war claims recently paid to lodges
and churches in this section mat
ters McCreary and many other able
men were unable to get through.
Right now, when Europe is engag
ed in the worst war in the history
of the world, and out of which we
have kept by the able guidance of
President Wilson and his advisers,
Mr. Helm has been the staunch sup
porter of the President. Only this
week, when a number of Democratic
congressmen flew the coop and
brought about conditions which
threatened to plunge the country in
to war, Mr. Helm stood squarely with
the President. It was such men as
Mr. Helm who have brought about
what now appears to be the complete
avoidance of war and saved the coun
try from possible destruction. Will
the Democrats of this district vote
against a man like that? Well, let
us give you the tip NEVER!

BEAUTFIUL QUEEN
S r'ifcSF WfW PHr $ s. v
MISS MARGARET HARDING
Her many friends in this section
merited honor which has been conferred upon Miss Margaret Harding,
the attarctive daughter of Col. and Mrs. Robert Harding, of Danville,
she having been elected Queen of the annual Carnival held by the stu
dents of Central Univeisity. For the past thirteen years it has been the
custom for the "C" men of the university to designate some girl as the
Queen of the Carnival festivities. This recognition has long been es
teemed the greatest honor within the bestowal of the "C" men. Miss
Harding has always been a universal favorite wtih the students of Ken

ANOTHER OLD '
CONFED IS GONE
M. Speed Peyton Passes Away As
Result of Paralytic Stroke Sus
tained Two Years Ago.
Another old Confederate soldier
has answered his last roll call; an
other of the grand old heroes that
wore the grey has, like the immor
tal Jackson, crossed the rver and is
resting under the shade of the trees.
Mathias Speed Peyton died at the
home of Mrs. Francis, at Rowland,
where he had lived for the past two
years, at 1 o'clock Friday afternoon
of paralysis. Nearly two years ago
he suffered a stroke of that fearful
disease and since had been helpless.
He was aware that the end was near,
and having made peace with his God,
was not afraid to die. A few years
ago he joined the Stanford Christian
church and he had since been a con
sistent, member. Mr. Peyton, who
was 74 years old, was the son of
Speed Peyton, and was born at Pey
ton's Well. He was one of ten chil
dren, all but two Mrs. Julia Pres
ton, of Junction City, and Mrs.
Greenberry Adams, of McKinney,
Texas, having joined the silent ma
jority.
Mr. Peyton joined the Confederate
forces early in the Civil War and was
a gallant soldier. He was a member
of Capt. Bob Logan s company and
was on the famous raid thru Ohio.
He was captured at Buffington, that
State, and kept a prisoner for a long
time. Returning from the war, he
gave his attention to farming, at
which he was only reasonably suc
cessful. For years he served as con
stable of Lincoln county and made a
most excellent official.
He was an exceedingly kind-hearted
man and none knew him but to ad
mire and respect him. The greater
portion of his last years were spent
out on Dix river, where "Cap" Pey
ton, as his friends knew him, was a
general favorite.
The burial occurred in Buffalo
cemetery Saturday afternoon, after
prayer and brief remarks at the
grave by Dr. D. M. Walker. The
following close friends acted as pall
bearers: Messrs. George P. Bright,
T. D. Newland, James P. Bailev, W.
S. Drye, Robert L. Porter, P. W.
Carter.

68 years of age Monday, and most of
his life was spent in the section where
he died. He had been a faithful
and consecrated members of the Mt.
Moriah Christian church for 51 years
and a deacon for 30 years. Besides
his wife, he is survived by seven chil
dren, and a host of friends and loved
ones will mourn that he is no more.
After services conducted by his pas
tor, Rev. Bowling, the remains of this
fine old gentleman were laid to rest
in the Mt. Moriah cemetery Monday
afternoon.

at Bourbon schoolhouse during a
speaking.
HORSE SALES CALLED OFF.
Gov. Stanley has very sensibly de
cided not to call a special session of
the legislature to revise the tax laws
of the state. A commission will
study the matter and make recom
mendations to the next Legislature.
THE COURT OF LAST RESORT.
Around the stove of the cross roads
grocery is real court of last resort.
for it finally over-rules all others.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy has
been brought before this court in al
most every cross roads grocery in
this country, and has always receiv
ed a favorable verdict. It is in the
country "where man expects to re
ceive full value for his money that
this remedy is most appreciated. Ob
tainable everywhere.
