COMPLETE VICTORY IS INDICATED:

BDffiD WILSON IN HIS ATTITUDE
Representative Pou Declares it is "Infamous Lie" to Say
Executive Wants War—Second Roil Call
Also a Victory.
Washington March 7.—By substantial majorities,
on two heavy test votes, President Wilson's stand that con
gress shall not advise Americans to abandon their rights
to travel on merchant ships armed for defense, was en
dorsed in the. house. Administration forces ruled the field
and defeated determined efforts to amend the resolution
to the liking of the president's opponents, and put it square
ly before the house for a final vote, probably at Q. o'clock
lonight.
In the first test Tote in the house on the armed ship question, the
administration forces :won 956 to 160. The opportunity for amending
the McLemffire resolution to warn Americans off armed ships of the
European belligerents was removed, and the house turned to debate on
the resolution Itself, with every Indication that it would be taibled as
the president desired, as a demonstration to foreign nations' that dis

Campbell demanded yeas and nays, and at 1:15 o'clock roll call be-

ASSKMBIJEAT 11 O CJLOOK FOR BIG FIGHT.
Previous to this, promptly at 11 o'clock, the house assembled for the
all-day fight of the administration forces to kill the McLemore resolu
tion. Speaker Clark was In the chair, and Acting Chairman Pou of
the rules committee, submitted a special rule under which debate pro
ceeded. Pou asked unanimous consent for a 80-mlnutce' debate on
the rule. Ibere was no objection and debate began.
POU GDIS FIRST APPMUSE.
Fou'tpok the floor and opened the light for rule. The first out
burst of applause from the floor came at the outset of I'ou's speech
when he said:
"AU the Imps of hell'never devised a more infamous lie than the
declaration that has been made that President Wilson wants war."

attacked the rule, however, as 'WwanDy, evasive and treacherous."
Representative Cantrill, of Kentuck^a^MHMWMit," and a member of
the rules cxHurmlttee, said he would .vote for tw rule, because only by
Its adoption- amid the house put Itself on record on the warning reso
lution Issue
"Thank God that President Wilson Is the chief executive of the na
tion now," he declared amid heavy'democratic applause.
At the end of an hour and a half of debate on the rule a vote on the
motion for "the previous question," a motion to end the debate on the
rule Itself was in order. This brought the first roll call and the first
victory for the administration forces.
WOUM SEEK DIRECT EXPRESSION.
Representative Campbell of Kansas, republican member of the
rules committee, announced when Pou concluded that If the motion to
close debate on the rule were defeated he would offer a substitute for
the McLemore resolution which would be a direct warning to Ameri
cans to keep off armed ships.
"If the rule Is defeated," declared Representative Harrison, dem
ocrat, of Mississippi, the administration leader, "you will not only send
joy to the hearts of the people In a foreign capital, but you will stab
your own president In the back."
Republican Leader Mann, In a ten-minute speech, pleaded that the
house defeat the rule in order that the McLemore resolution might be
amended and a vote on the straight warning resolution obtained.
IS QUESTION OF AMERICA FIRST.
Representative Harrison of Mississippi took up the debate for the
administration. "This is not a question for us to divide upon as dem
ocrats or republicans," said he. "It Is a question of America first. It
is a question whether you shall rise above narrow partisanship and
stand for the American government.
"The question today," he concluded, "is whether you are with the
president or against him."
MUST STAND WITH PRESIDENT.
Representative Chlperfleld of Illinois, republican, declared he fav
ored standing with President Wilson.
"The people of Illinois," he declared, "are desirous of standing by
the president to preserve the flag of the nation untarnished and un
sullied, but there is no more dangerous man than he who at all times
insists on the full measure of his rights, regardless of what disastrous
consequeices might follow.. He usually is either a fool or a knave and
sometimes both."
Loud cheers greeted this declaration. Scattered applause from the
democrats greeted Representative Gardner, republican, who spoke on
the parliamentary status of McLemore resolution.
"If yon want to stand with the president and two ex-presidents
you will vote to sustain the rule and table the Mcl/emore resolution,"
he said.
The rule providing for four hours'
debate on the motion to table Mc
l/emore warning resolution was adopt
ed on roll call, 271 to 138. One man

Twins of All Sizes and Ages
Attend Meeting for Their
Own Good.
Chicago, March 7.—There were all
sizes and sexes of twins at-the Di
versay Boulevard Methodist Episco
pal church Sunday night. They had
been rounded up by the Rev. Burt E.
Smith, the pastor. Those whom the
stork had not left in pairs had loan
ed their presence and their moral
suport to the success of the "'Twins'
Night" services.
The Rev. Smith had chosen for his
theme, 'The Birthright." He had
enumerated the powers God gives to
each of his children, principal among
them being the power to discover one
self through the Almighty, and thus
attain the highest Intellectual and
spiritual strength.
There were twins in the choir. Twin
girls whistled as a musical accom
paniment to hymns twin girls played
sweet violin music. And then—
"There are wonderful possibilities,
heretofore hidden, in each of you,"
the pastor said. "Who is there
among you who has not given his life
to Jesus who wishes to come forward
and' do so now?"
The choir was singing "God Will
J"ake Care of You" when a well-dress
ed man with an iron gray mustache
rose and came forward. With him
came his two twin boys, 9 years old.
The singing stopped and at the
Rev. Mr. Smith's request this man
turned and consecrated his own life
and his boys.'
"I intended leaving for Milwaukee
on a business trip when I saw the
Rev. Smith's announcement of twins'
night," the convert said later. "I
had been slipping a bit and I gave
up my trip for the sake of my boys/

Cannon, Jr., of Virginia, chairman of

8enator Chilton suggested that this
incident occurred twenty-five years
ago and that there was quite a differ

ward the liquor question then and to
day.
Dr. Cannon directed particular at

one of-them to the effect that liquor

ENLISTS IN LEAGUE
TO ENFORCE PEACE
Dr. W. O. Thompson.
-The Ohio branch of the League to
Enforce Peace, the object of which is
to establish and maintain peace after
the close of the present war, has just
been organized with Dr. W. O.
Thortipson, president of the Ohio state
university, as the tlrst president. The
league does not attempt to end the
present war nor to combat prepared
ness. Its aim is to establish an effec

WORST NOT TO
BE CANDIDATE
Will not be Nominee of Non
partisan League is
the Report.
(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N. D., Maroh 7.—John H.
Worst, deposed president of the North
Dakota agricultural college, will not
be the nominee of the North Dakota
Farmers Non-partisan league, if opin
ions expressed by officers of the
league, and a number of its cam
paigners, can be accepted as being in
dicative of the probable temper of the
state convention which will be held in
Fargo early in April—when the
league's candidate will be nominated.
For some time—in fact, ever since
Worst's breach with the board of re
gents—the possibility that the agri
cultural college president might be
come the league's candidate for the
governorship has been quite generally
discussed and commented.upon by the
press of this state—but so far as it is
possible to learn from league officials,
there is no disposition on the part of
that organization to back Worst for
the governorship.
Pledged to a program which has
the advancement of the farmer and
his Interests, the league's official pub
lication has repeatedly declared the
need of placing a farmer on the ticket
as a candidate for governor. Hence,
to turn from that program at this'late
hour is not looked upon as feasible.
Another plea made by the league
is against-the adoption of the candi
dacy of. sny man who has been previ
ously alttgned with the politicians of
the state,^and the fact that Worst has
been very active in politics, being a
candidate for senator two years ago,
disqualifies him under the provision
of the league's program.
Dr. Want has not yet determined
what he will do, but it is understood
that he is considering an offer to be
come associated with an agricultural
paper/ His, decision probably will be
announced shortly, but he has declar
ed that whatever line he adopts, he
stilly will continue a resident of North
Dakota.

PROTECT ITS NATIONAL HONOR
Washington. March 7.—-Discussing the armed ship issue in the
senate, Senator Sutherland of Utah, republican member of Uic foreign
relations committee, stood squarely behind President Wilson In his pol
icy In dealing with Germany In the submarine negotiations.
"J do not want war at any time," said Sutherland, "and I pray
God that It may not come. But I would rather have war with all Its
sacrifices and suffering than that this nation, with its long history of
heroism and glory, should play die poltroon when confronted by a su
preme national duty, because It {daces a greater value upon Its ease
than upon Its honor."
"I am one of those who desire peace," Senator Sutherland con
tinued, "but a nation, when all other means have failed, that will not
resent a flagrant and Illegal attack upon the lives or ita own citizens
Is only less destestable than a man who will not fight for his wife
and children. And, believing as I do about that, if the life of an
American citizen is again taken by the illegal and deliberate sinking
without warning of a merchant ship .unarmed or armed oidy for de
fense. I believe that this government should bring the offending nation
to a stern reckoning. I shall never give my consent to the issuance
of a formal and official notice such as has been proposed, which If not
heeded, would, without minimizing our duty in the least, have the ef
fect of embarrassing and weakening our moral standing. If we should
once more be under the sad necessity of seeking reparation for the
destruction of the lives of our people."
NO PLACE FOR
BACHELOR IUDGE
Court of Domestic Relations
Not Liked by Judge
Jacob Hopkins.
Chicago, March 7.—The court of
domestic relations is no place for a
bachelor judge.
Judge Jacob H. Hopkins has reach
ed this conclusion after six months on
the bench of this tribunal.
To save the remnants of his shat
tered ideals of matrimony, he has aslj
ed to be transferred to some other
court. To avert what seemed an im
pending tragedy to a bachelor soul.
Chief Justice Harry Olson has grant
ed his request. Judge John R. New
comer will succeed Judge Hopkins in
his position.
Judge Hopkins is handsome,
wealthy, cultured and regarded as one
of the city's eligible bachelors. When
not listening to marital woes he has
been kept busy dodging the darts of
cupid and the traps of designing
mammas.
Couldn't Stand It.
"Yes," said Judge Hopkins, "I'm

"I brought my ideals with me in

sat there day after day listening to
nothing but the sorrows and tragedies
of married couples, to the sordid tales
of wife-beatings, disloyal husbands,

"So 1 asked to be transferred. It

my illusions. But deep down in the
cyclone cellars of my soul, some may
have escaped. I wanted to quit this

"You see." added Judge Hopkins,

Minneapolis, March T.—Mayor W.
C. Nye yesterday issued an order re

AUTIiH
STAR SPARATE
Mrs. Belmont and Marie
Dressier Sever Connec
tions Abruptly.
New York. March 7.—Diplomatic
relations between Mrs. Oliver H. P.
Belmont and Miss Marie Dressier, late
star of "Melinda and Her Sisters," the
comic opera of which Mrs. Belmont
admits authorship, have been abrupt
ly severed.
The break between the erstwhile
associates in art came last Wednesday
night. Now Mrs. Belmont has set
her lawyer on Marie, ajid Miss Dress
ier has spurned the gift with which
the society leader recompensed the
burlesque artist's services, "for char
ity." But the crowning insult of all
Miss Dressier has bestowed on Mrs.
Belmont a second name, the deristve
title of "Alva 'Economical' Belmont."
And it is all for a song the Ballet
Russe, in which Miss Dressier gave a
screaming satire on "The Faun." Tt
was the hit of the piece and is the
center and circumference of the auar
rel.
Miss Dressier claims the song as her
property: Mrs. Belmont insists it is a
part of "Melinda" and belongs to her.
Miss Dressier holds the score and Mrs.
Belmont's lawyer demands Its return.
Dates Back Six Weeks.
The story of the affray dates back
six weeks before the performance on
February 19 at the Waldorf-Astoria,
when society watched its prettiest de
butantes, in setting oft distinguished
professionals act as superior chorus
ladies. The opera, written by Mrs.
Belmont and composed by Elsa Max
well, netted $8,000 for the Congres
sional Union.
The Russian ballet song was intro
duced when Miss Maxwell discovered
a similarity between Miss Dressler'a
chief song and one now being used
by another well known performer.
Miss Dressier worked up with Miss
Maxwell the idea of a satire on tho
"Faun." It was agreed that it should
not be published with the opera.
After the opera waa over, Mlsa
Dressier gathered up her song and
took it home. The next day she re
ceived from Mrs. Belmont, who was
not aware of the song's disappearance,
a fiattering letter of thanks and a Jew
eled parasol handle. Miss Dreesler
was happy over the letter and the
gift. Her awakening came nine day*
later, when Mrs. Belmont demanded
the return of the song.
"I don't fancy being called a thief,"
Miss Dressier said. "The song la mine.
If Mrs. Belmont felt herself too poeT
to pay for the orchestra, I was ready
to pay for it myself. The 'BUlet
