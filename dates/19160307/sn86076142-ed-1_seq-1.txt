Sodaville with its tungKten ores and

mineral resources in that portion of
Mineral county that are being de

The new camp of cinnabar, which

eleven miles northeast of that town,
Is destined to become an active lit

This deposit of ore of mercury was
discovered about two and one-half
years ago by Thomas Pepper and
Charles Keough, but at that time
quicksilver was bringing a very low
price and little development work was
done while the market was so depres
sed. Lately, however, the owners of
the original property, which consists
of twelve claims, have been very ac
tive, despite the clinialic conditions,
it having been one of the worst win
ters ever experienced in that section.
I he original locators were the flrst
to install a retort. it has been In
operation a little over a week and is
located on the ground of the Mina
Mercury rompany. They are sending
their ore down in a gondola over the
snow to the retort, each trip adding
500 pounds to the supply ready to be
treated.
Messrs, Farnam & Drew have pur

liminaries to Pinal Bal
lot on Resolution
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 7. In the first test vote in the house on
the armed ship question the administration forces won by a vote of
256 to 160, Opportunities for amending the McLemore resolution to
warn Americans off armed shins were removed, and the house turned
to a debate on the resolution. There is every indication that it will
be tabled, as the president desires. Representative Page of North
Carolina said he will not be a candidate for re-election, because he
disagrees with the president on the submarine controversy. This
caused a sensation in the house. The galleries of the house were
crowded. Men, women and children brought lunch, milk bottles and
opera glasses. The spirit of combat seemed to be in the air. Two
negro barbers in the house barbershop ended an argument by throw-
lng toilet water bottles at each other. They were arrested.
In the discussion of armed ships in the senate, Southerland, a Re-
publican, stood squarely behind the president, in his policy dealing
with Germany and submarine negotations. ' He said: "I do not want
war at any time. 1 pray it may not come now, but I would rather
have war with all Its sacrifices than that this nation should play
the poltroon when confronted by a supreme national duty."
About six thiB evening the administration forces will move to
table the McLemore resolution. The heavy votes they polled In the
preliminary ballots Indicate that they will kill It by a substantial
majority. Once tabled, it will have gone the way of the Gore reso-
lution in the senate.
