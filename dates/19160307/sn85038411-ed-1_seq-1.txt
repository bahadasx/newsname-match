VICE-PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR
OF PENNSYLVANIA STEEL CO.
Identified With Company
Many Years and Responsi
ble For Development of
Great Steelton Plant
WAS PIONEER IN
"HARRISBURG PLAN"
No Great Change to Follow
His Departure; Steelton
to Become Simply an Op
erating Unit of Schwab
System
J. V. W. Rcynders, who for many
years has been prominently identified
with the management of the big steel
plants at Steelton, announced to-day
that he lias presented his resignation
as vice-president and director of the
Pennsylvania Steel Company.
Mr. Reyndcrs' resignation caused
much surprise in steel circles, as it is
well known that he and President E.
<l. Grace of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany which recently purchased a con
trolling interest in the Pennsylvania
Steel Company, are warm personal
friends and that Mr. Grace was en
thusiastic over the Steelton properties
during his recent inspection of the
works.
To Remain Three .Months
Mr. Rcynders will remain at Steel
lon for a'period of three months at
least, putting the affairs of the Penn
sylvania Steel Company in shape for
the formal transfer. II is not unlikely
he will lie offered an important posi
tion with the Bethlehem Company, al
though he said to-day that his plans
for the immediate future are not de-
cided. He desires to be free from
m responsibility for a time in order to;
look carefully into several proposi-j
lions that have been placed before|
hint at intervals during the past few
years and he may not he in a position
to reach any conclusion for a consid-;
erable period.
(Juincy Bent tieneral Manager
Quincy Bent, at present assistant to
the president at the Sparrow's Point
plant, has been appointed general
manager of the plants at Steelton, but
lie will not be a successor to Mr.
Keynders, in view of the fact that the,
executive offices of the Bethlehem
Steel company are all located at
South Bethlehem and the Steelton
plants wil become simply an operating
unit of the great Schwab interests.
• No General Changes
There will be no wholesale changes
at Steelton, as the result of Mr.
Heynder's resignation. He said to-day
that he feels he is in a position to
assure the employes of the Steelton
works generally that their interests
will be thoroughly safeguarded by the
new owners of the property. Indeed
the impression is given if any
thing, the Schwab proprietorship
should improve the prospects of the
men actively employed about the plant
in view of the enlarged activities pro
posed by the new management.
President Grace made a very good

GRACE PRAISES REYNDERS;
BENT GENERAL MANAGER;
TO BE NO GENERAL CHANGES
PRESIDENT B. (j. GRACE, of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany, speaking over the long distance phone from the
offices of the Bethlehem Steel Company, 111 Broadway,
N. Y., to a representative of the Telegraph to-day, said:
"Mr. Rcynders' resignation must not be considered as any
reflection upon his ability or his services to the company, lie
and I arc very warm personal friends ami T have a high opin
ion of his ability and know full well that it was lie who made
Steclton wliat il is to-day. Mr. Rcynders resigned of his own
volition. He is a big man in the steel business and during our
recent visit to Steclton we were much pleased ami impressed
both with what he has done in a constructive way and with his
conduct of Hie big enterprise.
"Of course, you will understand that we will absorb com
pletely the Pennsylvania Steel Company and as one of its chief
executive officers, Mr. Rcynders goes with the others, hut 1
wouldn't have anybody think that there is anything but the
best of good feeling between us.
"Quincy Hcnt. assistant to the president at Sparrows
Point, who is familiar with the Steclton plant, will become gen
eral manager at Steclton, but he will not have the executive
authority vested in Mr. Rcynders, as the executive offices of
the Bethlehem Company are at South Bethlehem. He is at
present in Steclton, conferring with Mr. Rcvnders. His ap
pointment becomes effective at once, lie will be in complete
charge at Steclton.
"There are no other changes to announce. It is not our
purpose to put new blood into the plant at Steclton. What«tvc
desire to do Is to take the present organization and build for
the future from tliat. There is a big opportunity ahead for
advancement there. We have no desire to make any changes
I'lrst of all. it is our purpose to give cver.y man at Steelton fuli
and ample opportunitv to make good under the new manage
ment and it is our sifc ere hoi>e that there will be not one fail
ure.

of having the town on the route and
petitions, which are being signed by
scores, are in circulation in the town
and the adjoining townships.
Recently there was some discus

State road from Iteedsville to Mill
Creek, through the Kishacoqutllas
Valley. This road woyld be reached
by going from Lewistown to Iteeds
ville over a toll road, which at some
future time will be taken over by
the State. Of course, this route would
eliminate the Juniata Valley route
from Lewistown to Mill Creek and in
cidentally McVeytown would not find
a place along the highway. The route
through McVeytown would follow the
old turnpike from Philadelphia to
