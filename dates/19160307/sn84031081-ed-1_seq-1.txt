given that only routine business was
transacted during the afternoon.
The most important business of the
meeting was the appointment of the
finance committee, which was in
session until a late hour last night
going over the accounts of the asso
ciation, preparatory to formulating a
report to be submitted to the conven
tion. Nn word could be obtained as

As a matter of fact, little attention

other business was transacted or not.

Knee for Secretary.
El Paso also has two candidates in
the race for secretary of in,, associa
tion, in tho person of Col. Charles F.
Hunt and W. L. Amonotl. Here
again there Is to be n three-cornered
fight, for F. W. Plato, of Hovina, who
will have, the solid support of the
Amnrillo contingent, Is sure to put
up a stout tight for the position, and
his friends are already predicting
victory for him.
The real fight for the various hon

all the delegates have arrived and

I have an opportunity to cot himv. Jt
is Impossible at this time to predict
with any reasonable certainty who
will carry off the plums. The onlv
definite prediction that can be made
is that Amnrillo will be the next meet
ing place of the convention unless the
meeting becomes so entangled with
politics that trades will be made that
will cut her out of what she seems
now to hae won. i
