Powerful Assaults Upon the

Soldiers of France
EFFORTS TURNED
TOWARD FLANKS
Battle for Great Fortress
Still Raging With Big
Loss on Both Sides
London, March 6.—With the French
eenter In the Douaumont sector appar
ently atill holding firm against the des
perate assaults of the crown prince's
armies, the Germans are again turning
their attention to the flanks of the
French positions around the strong
hold.
Artillery activity in the' Woevre
region was reported in the Paris night
bulletin, the fire centering upon the
regions, of Haudamont and Fresnot,
about ten miles southeast of Verdun.
4? The heavy artillery of the Teutons is
pounding the defenses across the
Mouse river. The French are ready
for an Infantry attack there but it is
doubted in Paris if the Germans will
attempt the storming of the command
ing position to reach which their
troops would have to deploy over a
mile wide plan under a destructive
cross fire.
Furious Attacks Made.
Testing of the French strength by
furious assaults on the main defenses
Is continuing. In yesterday's attack
on the lead of the Douaumont sector,
near the Cote Du Poivre, French lines
also held firm, according to Paris,
while in front of Douaumont German
assaults were temporarily suspended,
the heavy French artillery continuing
its answer to the rain of giant shells
which the Teuton 42's and similar big
pieces were pouring upon the defens
ive trenches.
Correspondents who have been at
the front quote French^milltary men
as declaring that the German achieve
ments so far in the great battle for
Verdun have resulted merely, in re
... storing the lines to the positions they
.occupied before the French, in local
attacks, began expanding the defens
ive area about the fortress. Verdun
itself is now under German artillery
lire but, according to correspondents,
little damage has been done.
Plan New Offensive?
Indications that the Germans may
be planning another offensive move
ment on the western front are con
tained in reports from Dutch sources
that Important troops movements are
going on behind the front in Belgium.
Forty thousand German cavalrymen
are said to be on their way to the
battle line near Ypres, in which sector
the famous German attempt to break
through and reach Calais occurred in
April, 1915.
FRENCH 8TAND FIRM.
Paris, March 6.—Yesterday was a
good day for the French at Verdun,
according to information received this
morning, and public confidence is
greatly strengthened by the news of
the continued repulses of the German
attacks. In military and political
circles lively satisfaction is expressed
regarding the situation and the opin
ion now begins to prevail that the
great efforts of the Germans will he
Jnore easily disposed of than was at
first expected.
Having failed to make any impres
sion on the Douaumont position and
on Vaux to its right, the German gen
oral staff determined to smash the
French left on the Vacherauville
woodcote du Poivre position. With
out regard to cost the best troops
wereJiurled forward but with no more
success than elsewhere. Pomeranians
and/what was left of the Branden
burgers dashed themselves vainly
I '}, against the French, who stood as im
movable as a rock wall..
Heaps of Dead Left Behind.
As" at Vaux the Germans finally fell
back, leaving heaps of dead on the
ground. The French infantry, sup
ported by their formidable artillery,
which will never henceforth lack am
munition, showed themselves able to
resist every onslaught. On the left
bank of the Meuse artillery on both
sides thundered all day. The French
Infantry in that section has little to
do, but it remains there ready for any
emergency, although the military ex
perts believe it doubtful that the Ger
mans will attempt to storm La Mort
Homme key position, for to do so they
xnuBt deploy over plain a mile wide
under cross fire from the heights
around.
t» It Is chiefly the French artillery
tfc which is involved in the
fighting. The French hold the out
^skirts of the village of Manheulles
-jgfirmly and have stopped all attempts
and i* Germans to debouch in that di
jctlon.

Rome, March 6.—Monslgnor Benig
ni, who was undersecretary of state
In the Vatican administration during
part of the pontificate of Pope Plus
X, has written an article for the Nu
ova Antologla review on the question
of the participation of the holy see in
the peace conference which Is expect
ed to be held at the conclusion of the
war.
Replying to one of the objections
raised by the Italian press against the
intervention of papal delegates, name
ly that the heads of all other
churches would claim a similar right
of representation, Monslgnor Benlgnl
says that all heads of religions should

evitably be represented at the pros

bishop of Canterbury but the king of
England is the head of the establish

or of Russia is head of the orthodox
Greek church of Russia, the king of
Prussia is head of the Evangelical
church of Prussia and the sultan of
Turkey and the emperor of Japan are
heads of the dominant religions of
their empires.

Des Moines, March 6. —Considera
tion of proposed dates and locations
for the state republican convention
was taken up immediately today when
members of the republican state cen

It was expected that the committee
also would consider the necessity of

Different opinions have been ex
pressed regarding the legal necessity
of holding the so-called first republican
convention and in the absence of any
ruling on the matter from the attorney
general the state committee is expect

The committee also may take up
consideration of a successor to' the

CRIMINALS HAVE
AI0 IN ESCAPING
Chicago, March 6.—A powerful or
ganization exists for the purpose of
assisting fugitive criminals, to whom
the war has closed the capitals of
Europe, to escape to Havana, accord
ing to the belief of State's Attorney
Hoyne.
Traces of the organization, it was
said, have been brought to light in the
search for a widely known criminal
wanted here as a witness. It was
pointed out that the stringent regula
tions in Europe have rendered value
less the fraudulent passports formerly
employed by Escaping criminals and
that Havana is within striking dis
tance of Palm Beach, a fashionable
American winter resort.
It Is asserted that the organization
has been perfected to a point where
criminals are warned of a pending at
tempt to extradite them from Cuba in
time to escape to Honduras, where
there is no extradition to the United
States, or to some of the nearby
Islands where they may hide in safety.

TOFIGHT WILSON
Pacifist Leader at Capital
to Advocate Resolution
Warning Americans
MATTER COMING TO
VOTE IMMEDIATELY
German Documents Showing
British Abuse of Guns
on Ships Received
Washington, D. C., March 6. —The
house rules committee today agreed
upon and will bring into the house to
morrow, a special rule for four hours'
debate on the McLemore resolution,
warning Americans off armed ships of
the European belligerents. This ac
tion puts the much discussed resolu
tion into a parliamentary position
where administration leaders are con
fident they can kill it.
While the rules committee was
meeting Representative Bailey tele
phoned invitations to senators and rep
resentatives to lunch with William J.
Bryan at 1 o'clock at a hotel near the
capitol. About twenty members of con
gress were invited, most of whom are
strong advocates of a warning resolu
tion.
Mr. Bailey declined to make public
his entire invitation llts but some of
those invited were Senators Kern and
Vardaman and Representatives Calla
way and Slayden, Texas Tillman, Ark
ansas Helverlng and Ayres. Kansas
Steele, Pennsylvania Hensley, Mis
souri Stephens and Shallenberger,
Nebraska Dill, Washington Van
Dyke, Minnesota Slsson, Mississippi
and Tavenner, Illinois.
Efforts were made to invite men re
garded as particularly friendly to Mr.
Bryan and to draw representatives
from as many different sections of the
country as possible.
When the senate convened Sena
tor McCumbecof l^oi-th-Dftkota^ author
of & pending resolution of warning,
discussed the subject.
"The country, while ever ready to
defend the rights of its citizens, does
not want the citizens to lead us use
lessly Into war," he said. "True Amer
ican patriotism demands that no
American should jeopardize a peaceful
settlement nor precipitate a grave
crisis."
Man is Chered.
When Representative Gardner de
clared in the house that there should
be a clear vote on the subject, Repub
lican Leader iMann announced he was
against bringing the matter up in the
house at all.
"I have believed," said Mr. Mann,
"in letting the house attend to Its
constitutional duties and letting the
president attend to his constitutional
duties."
The house resounded with cheers
when Mr. Mann took the floor and
assailed Americans who might involve
the country in war by traveling on
armed ships.
"I hope our citizens never will be
put to the test of having to fight be
cause some fool has involved us by
entering upon a joy ride," he shouted.
The special rule will provide that
after the
%four
1
hours' debate, the Mc­
Lemore resolution will be before the
house for action. The program is to
table it, as was done with the Gore
resolution in the senate, thus express
ing the sentiment of a majority of the
house that no legislation whatever
regarding the traveling of Americans
on armed ships shall be enacted.
GERMAN DOCUMENTS H^RE.
Washington, D. C., March 6. —The
appendices to Germany's declaration
of tbe new submarine campaign, upon
which Berlin is relying to prove that
British merchant ships, armed osten
sibly for defensive purposes, have been
using their armament offensively on
the submerslbles, under orders of the
British admiralty, arrived this morn
ing at the state department.
When President Wilson and Secre
tary Lansing have had opportunity to
go over them very thoroughly they
probably will take the next step in the
negotiations with Germany.

NEW ARMY BILL
PROVIDES LARGE
DEFENSIVE EORCE
HOUSE COMMITTEE INTRODUCES
MEASURE DESIGNED TO PRO
TECT THE COUNTRY.
Washington, D. C., March 6.—With
the introduction of the house army bill
by Chairman Hay of the military com
mittee, the second of the national de
fense measures recommended by Pres
ident Wilson was before congress. The
house bill was accompanied by a re
port which asserts that the committee
believes it has embodied In the meas
ures "every feature necessary to bring
about a reasonable plan for national
defense."
As completed the measure,proposes
to increase the regular army to 140,
000 fighting troops which means the
addition of 40,000 men and 7,439 of
ficers. It also provides 786 additional
officers for detached service with the
national guard, military schools and
elsewhere.
A maximum strength, however, Is
fixed at 170,000 men.
The bill provides for federalization
of the national guard under a militia
pay bill substantially similar to that
proposed In the senate bill. The house
plans, however, differ from the -senate
bill in that the president is authorised
to draft national guardsmen into the
federal service on the outbreak of war.
The ultimate strength of the guard
is greater under the house plan since
the minimum force of 425,000 is stipu
lated to the Organization within five
years. The senate plan provides for
approximately 250,000 guardsmen.
In the house bill as in the senate an
officers' reserve corps is provided for
but the house plan would double the
enrollment at the military academy.
Chairman Hay's report estimates that
a force of 1,324,790 men trained for
military service "will be at once avail
able upoh the passage of this bill." To
reach this total he relies upon the
regulars with a strength of 140,000 and
a reserve of 60,000, upon 129,000 na
tional guardsmen, the guard's present
strength, and upon 95,750 regulars or
nation*! -guardsmen.

A series of thefts in which hun

was stolen
waB
Interrupted and
two of the culprits arrested about 1
o'clock Sunday morning by Deputy
Sheriff Charles Doran, Merchants' Po
lice Charles Sauders .and Officer
Charles Kapp of the local police force,
assisted by H. G. Anderson and Gus
Hallberg, a clerk in the Anderson
clothing store. The thefts have, cov
ered a period of seven to eight weeks
I and Anderson'B Hub clothing store
I was the victim of the thieves. The
arrest followed the trapping at the
store of a pair of the robbers who are
believed to work In a band of at least
five. George Eaton and William
Blacksley are the lads taken by the
officers and they have been In the
county jail since their arrest. Both
were bound over to await the action
of the grand Jury under $500 bonds by
Police Judge Ramsell this morning.
Statements made by the lads to the
officers enabled Sauders and Happ to
locate a large quantity of the stolen
goods and these have been returned
to the store. There is still a number
of articles missing that have not been
found but the loot unearthed will
reach a value of more than $300.
Theft Covers Long Period.
Mr. Anderson said today that the
robberies have been carried on for a
period of seven to eight weeks and all
efforts to catch the thieves until that
of Sifttfflfiy night have been fruitless.
Pour visits have been made by the
robbers to the store and each trip
took place on a Saturday night.
The methods employed by the lads,
according to Mr. Anderson, show sys
tematic planning and execution wor
thy of finished crooks. Lookouts and
sentinels were employed and a check
kept on the movements of Mr. Ander
son and the employes of the large
store, hence the difficulty in trapping
the thieves at work.
Kept Tab on Anderson.
One lookout was generally stationed
at the corner of Market and Main
streets to give the signal when the
proprietor boarded the street car for
his home on Saturday nights after the
store closed. Others were stationed
In the vicinity of the building where
they could signal the workers on the
Inside if all was well. The gang,
some of whom had beeh employed In
the building when it was remodeled
several months ago and were familiar
with the cellar and the various doors,
etc., were thoroughly acquainted with
the surroundings both as to the rear
of the store, }!he means of entry and
the fact that the lights from the work
shop of the Lowenberg bakery played
on the back portion of the clothing
store and made entry a risk save on
Saturday nights. The fact that the
bakers work every night but Saturday
gave the thieves a chance to work at
their scheme of robbery with appar
ent ease on ,that night.
The cellar extends back farther
than the rear walls of the store, ow
ing to a jieating plant having formerly
been located there. The roof of this
part of the cellar has a small scuttle
barely large enough for an average
person to crawl through and It is by
way of this scuttle that entry and ex
it have been made.
Prepare for the Visitors.
Saturday night Mr. Anderson was
determined if possible to trap the
thieves because he had been foiled
on former attempts and he notified
Deputy Sheriff Doran to come to the
store about midnight. Earlier in the
night four of the gang were seen at
the rear of the store about 10 o'clock
but they scampered away, apparently
by signal from a lookout, shortly be
fore Merchants' Policeman Sauders
made the rounds in that vicinity.
Mr. Anderson then posted a man in
the third floor of the building where
he could command the rear of the
store and when the lights were ex
tinguished Mr. Anderson started as
usual for the corner of Market and
Main streets, where he boarded a car
but left it at the railroad crossing
and, walking around the block, came
back to the store. The lookout was
called in, Mr. Doran arrived and the
three men took stations inside the
store to await developments.
It was after midnight when the
deputy sheriff* arrived and the trio
did not have to wait for a great
length of time before they heard the
thieves in the cellar. Unable to
move from their places until they
heard the robbers prying open the
door at the cellar stairway, they then
took new positions where they were
able to get the drop on the thieves.

WILSON SELECTS
WAR SECRETARY
NEWTON D. BAKER NOMINATED
FOR P08T VACATED BY LIND
LEY M. GARRISON.
Washington, D. C., March 6.-Newton
D. Baker, former mayor of Cleveland,
has been selected by President Wilson
for secretary of war. The president
and Mr. Baker hate been close friends
for some time. Mr. Baker is said to be
in close sympathy with the president's
policies and Is known to have had the
support of spme members of the cab
inet for the war office.
Mr. Baker is 44 years old. He was
born in Martinsburg, W. Va., and at
the age of 25 was appointed private
secretary of Postmaster General Wil
son in President Cleveland's cabinet
In 1897 he began the practice of law
at Martinsburg but not long thereafter
moved to Cleveland where he became
city solicitor in 1902. He held this
office for ten years until his election
as mayor. In 1914 he was reelected
mayor for a two year term.
For years Mr. Baker has been close
ly identified witfi the reform move
ment in Cleveland. He brought about
an adjustment of the street railway
franchises in Cleveland.
At the time of the Baltimore conven
tion when President Wilson was nom
inated Mr. Baker was prominently
mentioned for the vice presidency be
cause of the fight he made in support
of Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Baker has been known for years
as a leader of the Ohio bar and is
highly regarded by the president as a
lawyer.
Mr. Baker was known as the original
Wilson man in Ohio. At the time of
the Baltimore convention in 1912 Jud
son Harmon, former governor of Ohio,
was candidate for the presidential
nomination and controlled a majority
of the Ohio delegation, but Baker was
for Wilson and swung with him a num
ber of northern Ohio delegates. The
successful fight, which he personally
led on the floor of the convention to
prevent the .adoption of the unit rule
saved these Ohio votes to Wilson.
Mr. Baker is a member of the Ohio
state democratic committee and chair
man of the executive committee of his
county committee. He has the recofd
of having run for public office in Cleve
land during fourteen consecutive years
without defeat. He declined to run
for office again in order to devote his
time to private law practice.
APPEALS TOJPUBLICANS
President Wilson Calls on Leaders of
Opposition to Stand By Him in
His Alien Policy.
Washington, D. C., March 6.—Presi
dent Wilson appealed directly to Rep
resentatives Bennett and Leiyroot,
republican members of the house rules
committee today to consider the arm
ed ship issue without partisan bias and
assist in getting a vote on a resolution
warning Americans off armed ships.
For an hour he discussed the foreign
situation with th# two republican
members and told them of the neces
sity of demonstrating that reports
abroad that the majority of congress
was not with him are erroneous.
After the conference Mr. Lenroot
said the republicans had no intention
of bringing party considerations Into
the Issue. Both he and Mr. Bennet re
fused to discuss the details of the con
ference.
CAPITATSTREET
CAR MEN STRIKE
Washington, D. C., March 6.—The
capital of the United States realized
fully today that it had a street car
strike. When the companies began
running cars this morning with the
few men who stuck to their posts, re
cruit crews of .inspectors, clerks, ma
chinists and former employes they
gave service about 25 per cent of nor
mal.
The result was that the few cars
operating between 8 and 9 a. m. were
overloaded and thousands of people
walked.
So far the strike has proceeded
without violence. Leaders have urg
ed the men to be peaceable and to re
main away from saloons. Confer
ences between strike leaders, railway
company heads, the board of commis
sioners which governs the District of
Columbia, and representatives of the
department of labor, in progress here
all night, continued today.
The men demand a minimum wage
of thirty cents an hour and ten hours'
work within twelve consecutive hours.
One company now pays twenty-two
and a half cents an hour and the oth
er pays twenty-five. The men con
tend that some of them are obliged by
Interrupted runs, to be practically on
duty sixteen to eighteen hours to get
in a day's work.
The railway company heads main
tain that the strike was called prac
tically without wanting early Sunday.
