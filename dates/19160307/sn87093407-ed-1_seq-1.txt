<lf Twelve years ago,
L. Brown was a "bum
lawyer" in Seattle. He
savs so himself. He's rather proud of the fact
that he recognized it himself and quit. He quit
to become a farmer. He took over a stump
patch near Nisqually. He was a greenhorn, but
lie meant business. And now Brown's farm is
known as "the parcel post ranch."
If You sec, after Brown mastered the art of
farming, and converted his patch into one of
the finest show farms in the West, a ranch of
2,600 acres, he also pot busy on the job of
scientifically bringing the producer and the con
sumer together. Then along came Uncle Sam,
and Brown promptly annexed himself to Uncle's
parcel post idea.
If Now over So per cent of the products of his
ffarm are being distributed by parcel post.
Brown is making money hand over fist. And
his customers are saving money, of course.
There isn't another man in the country who
has taken such fine advantage of the benefits
of the parcel post—and A. L. Brown's fine
syste mof efficiency is well worth knowing
something about.
€J1 The Star has sent Jack Jungmeyer, special
writer, to Rive Brown and his farm the once
over. Jack has come back, enthused with the
idea that Farmer Brown's accomplishments are
chockfnl of inspiration and helpfulness to every
man and woman, whether on the farm, in the
office, or in the kitchen. You will want to read
hi* stories about this unusual farmer and his
wonderful farm, 80 miles from Seattle. They

to Debate and Roll-Call
Which Sustains President
by Almost Two to One.
WASHINGTON. March 7.—Two crushing prelimi
nary administration victories in the house in the fight
on McLemore's resolution warning Americans off armed
liners left little doubt that the representatives would
completely comply with President Wilson's demand that
the measure be killed.
The first vote prevented a ballot being taken on a
simple substitute for the Mcl.emore resolution. The
second brought the Mcl.emore measure up for final dis-

The Mcl.emore resolution. after a preamble, recite* the facts in
the armed liner controversy, and nays:
"Therefore, he It resolved, that the houae request the president
of the I'nited State* to warn all Americans from traveling on shtpa
of any and all powers now or in the future at war. which mount

risk."
position and four hours' debate on it began. It is be
lieved the final vote on tabling the resoTutlbfi 'wITT fee
gin about 6 p. m.
The first test resulted in a vote of 256 to 160 in
the administration's favor. The house by that ballot re
fused to permit amendment to McLemore's warning
measure.
On the second roll call the administration won an
other victory. By a vote of 271 to 138 the house
adopted the rule bringing the resolution up for final
disposition.
Party affiliation* generally were,
effaced on the first ballot, but the
democrat* voted as a rule to cut
off amendment of the
resolution Following a cabinet
session, President Wllwin, with
Secretary McAdoo and Postmaster
General Burleson, remained in the
executive offices to learn of the
vote. A* news was rushed to them '
"play by plav," they appeared much
pleased.
It was evident the administra

DEBATE RAGES HOT
Rep. Pou Starts Off the Fireworks
WABHINOTON. March 7. —The fight on resolution,
warning Americans off armed liners, started In the house at 11:10 a m.,
when Representative Pou called up for consideration the rules submit
ting McLemore's measure to the house
After the house passed the rule for a 90-mlnute debate. Represen
tative Pou opened for the administration, unemotionally reciting Presi
dent's Wilson's request for a "showdown," and the steps leading to it.
"It is said," declared Pou. "that the McLemore resolution
does not raise the desired issue. Its express terms say that If
Americans travel on armed liners, they do so at their own risk.
Is there a human being who would atand for such a doctrine?
We would bring upon ourselves the contempt of all civilized
men.
"It has been unjustly charged that the president want*
war. All the Imps of hell never devised a more infamous lie."
Pou warmed up to his subject toward the last, and shouted his deo
limit ion about the imps of hell with considerable spirit.

Campbell, senior republican
