In a masterly manner, character

last night at the organization of the
new city council delivered his first
annual address. The council cham
ber in the city hall was crowded
with many of the leading citizens of
Bemidji
A wide knowledge of civics, phil
osophy and economics was indicated
by the city's executive in summariz
ing what he deemed Bemidji's needs
and reforms
Police Efficiency.
Ot primary importance, because it
was the first of his recommendations,
Mayor Vandersluis stated that he
would endeavor to establish and
maintain a degree of efficiency, cour
tesy and public spiritedness in the
police department that would attract
the attention of not only the resi
dents of this locality but also would
impress all visitors to Bemidji.
The new mayor urged the citizens
of Bemidji to co-operate with him
and to make suggestions to him. He
also urged the fire department to co
operate with him and he offered to
the department every assistance that
he would be able to give.
Clean Up Vice.
He recommended the cleaning of
the streets, alleys, parks and lake
shores.
He stated that the vice conditions
would be given close attention and
pledged himself to his utmost ability
to remove any such detrimental sit
uations
He urged economical public im
provements.
The mayor's address follows in
full:
Hon City Council and Citizens
of Bemidji:
In making this, my first appear
ance before you as the chief execu
tive officer of Bemidji I feel that I
can safely state that we meet with
the kindliest wishes for each other's
success and the general welfare of
the citythe city which impresses
us all with its natural beauty and
great possibilities and whose rapid
advancement in population, public
improvements and moral standard it
shall be our mutual ambition to
achieve.
Duties Outlined.
The charter of the city of Bemidji
provides as follows: "The mayor
shall be the chief magistrate of the
city He shall take care that
the laws of the state, the provisions
of this charter and the ordinances
of the city are duly observed and
enforced within the city, and that
all officers of the city discharge their
respective duties, and to that end
may maintain any appropriate ac
tion or proceeding against any del
inquent officer or other person. He
shall from time to time give the city
council information and recommend
such measures as he shall deem ad
vantageous to the city."
These duties, it shall be my earnest
and fearless ambition to perform.
It is, however, also my ambition
to have each and every citizen of
the community realize that all are
on an equal footing and that no per
sons or class of persons are to be
either favored or persecuted.
Public Spiritedness.
It shall likewise be my endeavor to
establish and maintain that degree
of efficiency, courtesy and public spir
itedness in the police department that
will attract the attention of, and
call forth favorable comment from,
not only the residents of this locality,
but also to so impress all visitors to
Bemidji I desire to have the po
lice officers at all times exhibit a
willingness to comply with all reas
onable requests for information, to
be ever ready to assist in any move
ment for the public good, as well as
to exercise good sound judgment in
the enforcement of the laws of our
state and the ordinances of our city.
I appreciate in particular my duty
to co-operate with the city council
and sincerely trust that all of our
relations will be of a most friendly
character. It shall, in fact, be a
pleasant part of my official cares to
do all that I can to assist the council
by any suggestion or information I
Economy, Civic Beauty and
Co-operation Are Slogans
In Address O Vandersluis
MAYOR VANDERSLUIS
IN ADDRESS ADVOCATED
FOLLOWING POLICIES
No class of persons to be
favored.
Efficiency, courtesy and
public spiritedness in police
department.
Streets, alleys, parks and
lake shores to be kept clean,
sanitary and attractive.
Rigid observance of laws
relating to vice.
Economical public improve
ments.
An economical business ad
ministration.
may feel to be of value to it and
shall, in turn, appreciate and care
fully consider similar action on its
part or that of any of its members.
And further and while on the sub
jest I wish to state in general that
I invite all citizens to make any sug
gestions to me appropriate for the
proper management of the city af
fairs and to which in my official ca
pacity they feel that my attention
should be called.
Urges Co-operation.
Likewise it shall be my desire to
co-operate with the fire department
and hope that its members will free
ly call upon me for any assistance
they feel that my office can afford the
department. This is one of the most
important parts of our municipal or
ganization and the standard of its
efficiency, especially as it is purely
dependent upon volunteers, merits
the approval of all citizens and other
persons whose lives and property it
protests and defends
It shall be one of my ambitions to
see that our streets, alleys, parks
and lake shores are kept in a olean
sanitary and attractive condition-!
a condition from which all can not
only reap material health and enjoy
ment, but also to furnish additional
beauty to our naturally attractive lo
cation.
To Locate Vice.
The vice conditions of our city
shall receive close attention and I
feel that a particularly rigid observ
ance should be made relative to any
conditions existing which may at
tract and actually injure the chil
dren and young men and women of
the city, and I shall strive to the ut
most of my ability to locate and have
removed any such detrimental situa
tion.
I shall give all ordinances or other
matters referred to me for approval
the most careful study and attention
and in my official action thereon I
shall certainly conscientiously ex
press my best judgment.
Urges Improvements.
I believe in public improvements
of all kinds but am firm in the con
viction that in the acquiring of them
we should do so only in proportion
to our financial condition. I feel
that if in order to obtain certain im
provements, though needful as they
may be, we must cause ourselves to
become distressingly burdened with
taxation we should strive to postpone
the investment until such time as our
resources will accommodate our de
sires.
In conclusion I have to say that
as a candidate for the office I now
have the honor of holding I empha
sized the fact that, if elected, I
would give the city, so far as my
ability and jurisdiction allowed, an
economical business administration.
I am now mindful of that statement
and in pursuance thereof I stand
ready, and shall ever be alert, for
an opportunity to fulfill that promise
to its most exacting extent.
Business Administration.
I feel that in the management of
the affairs of a city the careful,

HIGHWAY COMMISSION
DISCUSSES PROPOSED
JEFFERSON HIGHWAY
Believed That Bemidji Will Be Ulti
mate Destination of Three
Routes Proposed.
MAY BE HELD AS PRIZE FOR
ROAD BUILDING CONTEST
Little Falls and Staples4
Route May
Be Adopted Route Through
Brainerd Considered.
(By United Press)
St. Paul, Minn., March 7.Deci-
sions regarding the Jefferson high
way route through Northern Minne
sota were to be reached today at a
meeting of the state highway com
mission. The suggestion of R. C.
Dunn, a member from Princeton,
Minn that the route of the highway
through Northern Minnesota be held
out as a prize in a road building con
test, was scheduled for serious dis
cussion.
Back Proposal.
Editors along the route of the
highway through Northern Minne
sota are said to have backed up
Dunn's proposal Members of the
highway commission say it is likely
to go through the territory having
the best existing roads, provided, of
course, such a route is consistent
with the principle of putting the
route through the shortest distance
between two points.
Three Routes Up.
A route via Little Falls and Sta
ples seemed today to be the most
likely to be finally adopted. It had
even been stated by some members
of the commission, to be tentatively
designated. A second route through
Sauk.Center. Sj^CloiuL^d^^dsn/i,
was striving for consideration
against a third route through Elk
River, Princeton, Mille Lacs and
Brainerd.
Through Bemidji.
The latter route is being boosted
because of scenic advantages. Dunn
wants all three routes designated as
tentative, he told the commission to
day, and wants the permanent deci
sion made for the route showing the
best road development after a stated
period.
In the event of the adoption of any
of these routes it appeared quite cer
tain today that Bemidji would be
the ultimate destination of all three
routes, and that from that point the
highway would either go directly
north from Bemidji or north by west,
avoiding Crookston, and passing in
to Manitoba northwest of Bemidji.
FINAL PROOF IS
MADE ON 80 ACRES
Syver Pederson of Island Lake to
day made final proof at the court
house on 80 acres in Section 28,
Township 150, Range 32.
LAST DANCE BEFORE

The Bemidji band will give a dance
at the'city hall tonight. This will
be the last dance to be given in Be
midji before the opening of the Len
ten season.
St. Paul, Minn.Because authori
ties considered inquest into death of
Rev. Father Henry Jajeski was made
unnecessary by the repeated confes
sions of Mrs. Frank Dudek, inquest
scheduled for today was not held.
The priest was shot while in confes
sion Saturday night.
