WARNING TO
JOY RIDERS
Hat No Sympathy with American
Who Would Ride on Armed
Shipi, Perhaps Involving
Nation' in War,
WOULD LET WILSON ALONE
Not Inclined to Interfere with Pre
ident in Discharge of His Con
stitutional Duties.
WASHINGTON, March Hhe
bouse resounded wih cheers when
Mr. Mann took the floor today and
assailed Americans who might In
volve the country In war by traveling
on armed ships.
"I hope our citizens never will be
put to the test of having to fight be
cause some fool has Involved ns i?y
nterlng upon a "Joy ride," he
nhouted.
When Representative Gardner de
clared there should be a clear vote
on the subject Republican Leader
Mann announced that he was against
bringing the matter up n the house
at all.
"I have believed," said Mr. Mann,
"In letting the house attend to Its
constitutional duties and letting the
president attend to his constitutional
duties."
"'he gentleman from Maasachuaetta.
Mr. Gardner," aald Republican Lender
Minn "haa charaed that tne memDer-
ip of the house In this matter haa been
ctuated. flrat by part lean, reasons, and
second by fear of the votea at home. The
.... .
gentleman irom aiassacuuBeiia ia enuncu
to apak fur himaelf. but not for any on
else on either aide of thla house. This U
too grave a question for the patriotic
men of thla houae to be actuated by baao
motives aa suggested by JJje gentleman
from Massachusetts."
Bryaai at Lancheesu
William Jennings Bryan made hla head
quarters today at a hotel almost under
the shadow of the catltol, and conferred
at luncheon with many congressmen who
ire rated as Bryan men.
Mr. Bryan Insisted that the luncheon
waa only a "friendly gathering." Repre
sentative Balley'a view at the same time
waa that it was "a meeting of those op
posed to preparedness and armed ships."
He was especially emphatlo In hla dec
laration that bo "conspiracy" waa on
foot. '
"I Won't say that t shall not discuss
warning American cltltens against tak
ing passage on armed ships," Mr. Bryaa
aald. "but I will say that I have said
nothing about It thus far."
Weald Man fcy rreaMesvt.
Representative Flood, chairman of the
foreign affairs committee, told the house
that the Issue was broader than any ques
tion of warping people off ships or ef
procedure and precedents.. It was a ques
tion, he declared, of whether when the
president la engaged In a diplomatic ne
gotiation with a foreign government.
'we should stand with our president, or
with a foreign power, whether we stand
with America, or with the government
rlth which America la negotiating.".
"When the time cornea to act tomor
row," Mr. Flood added, "I hope that
every patriotic congressman, and I think
every member of thla house Is patriotic,
will be found standing behind the presi
dent. Woodrow Wilson." "
Mr. f-lood sold the talk In the house
about a warning resolution had been cir
culated through the newspapers and it
had gor.e abroad that the house was in
favor of the McLemore resolution. "The
fact that his information got to the
capital at Berlin," he aald, "stopped tha
negotiations with Germany and hampered
President Wilson, balked him. and left
him In a situation where not to act
would be worse than anything else. Tt

NAVY OF UNCLE
SAM NOT SO BAD,
SAYS FLETCHER
Three Dreadnaughts and Four Cruis
ers Added and American Fleet
Would Be Readv to Meet
Any of Them.
WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO GERMAN
With Three Dre adnanghts and Seten
Cruisers Both Coasts Could Be
Defended Against Enemy.
REPORT TO HOUSE COMMITTEE
WASHINGTON. Match 6. Three
dreadnauglita and four battle cruis
er added to tho American fleet,
built and authorised, would make It
the equal In flRhting strenRth of the
present German fleet, Admiral
Fletcher, commander of the Atlan
tic fleet, asserted today before the
house naval committee.
While Germany has seven battle
Cruisers nnd the t'nited Rtntes none,
the admiral said, the thlrty-fve-knot
craft proposed by the Navy depart-;
nient would be bo much superior to
'tnything- now afloat that four of
them, possibly three, would more
than offset the seven German boats.
With the present fleet of forty-two
battleships of atl types, three additional
dreadnaughts and seven battle cruisers.
Admiral Fletcher thought, "we co. Id
reasonably expect to make a' good de
fense, although not an absolute one," of
both coasts against any combination of
two enemy powers that did not Include
Great PNtaln.
The admlrae said that he and a ma
jority of the higher officers of the navy
disapproved the personnel board proposal
to subscribe promotion by election by the
seniority system. Ho said that It the
president were authorised to transfer 4
per cent of the captains, commanders
and lieutenant commanders to the ' re
serve list, employing them In consular
work abroad as Instructors in military
schools, or on other work for the gov
ernment, the way for promotion of efll
clent officers would be open without ad
ditional expense.. The present system of
selection for high commands and bureau
heads he said provides a sure way of
putting the right man In the right place.
Admiral Fletcher thought that the
training and education of all navy offi
cers was so nearly Identical that to muks
selection among the officers la any grade
,p .those uuaUfled for promotion., as pro
posed, would be a difficult task. ' There
was little to choose among M per cent
of the men In any grade, he -added, all
being required to be experts In many
subjects, such ss seamanslilp, gunnery,
engineering, and to have In addition a
knowledge of International law beyond
that of the average lawyer. Aa a nat
ural process, he explained, they now spe
cialised along the line to which they felt
the most attraction and were appointed
to posts that would get the best results
for tho havy from that study.
