BRYAN
SPENDS
DAY AT CAPITOL
Influence May Be Felt In Fight Over
Armed Ship Issue
House May Indulge In Long Debate
On Resolution
Washington, March 6. Former Sec
rotary of State Bryan was the guest
at a lunc.ieon hero today with Demo
cratic opponents In congress of Pres
ident Wilson's foreign policy. Mr.
Bryan detailed h s reasons tr-r sup
porting pending resolutions -warning
Americans against travel on the arm
ed ships o belligerents. Tho lunch
eon In honor of Mr. Bryan was given
by Representative Bailey of Pennsyl
vania, ono of the most outspoken crit
ics of the administration in the house.
Fear won expressed by administra
tion supporters that the desertion of
two Democratic members of the rules
committee, would defeat their purpose
to shut off debate in tie house on tho
McLemorc resolution, which will come
up for consideration tomorrow. This
measure, which requests tho presi
dent to i3suo a proclamation warning
Americans from travel on armed
chips, will ho tabled if the president's
wishes are observed. Administration
spokesmen are hopeful of curtailing
discussion, feeling that such action
would strengthen those who favor
standing by the president in this
emergency.
Although Majority Leader Kltchin
strongly favors the straight warning
toto plan, doubt is expressed that he
will oppose the administration pro
gram on the floor in case of favorable
action on it by the rules committee.
He frankly admits that the Demo
cratic members of the rules commit
tee have shown no disposition thus
far to entertain his suggestion favor
ably. If ho can not obtain the substi
tution of a straight vote resolution,
Mr. Kitchin probably will vote to ta
ils the McLemoro proposition, on the
ground that Its form is bad.
Senators Gore. McCumber and
Jones purpose to force another vote
in tho facnato on the merits of the sub
marina issue. Tho administration

commanders will fire without warn

that body will follow the lead of the

GERMANY WILL NOT
MODIFY ITS DEGREE
Senate's Action Discussed In
Berlin Official Circles,
Berlin, March 6. Tho news of tho
United State senate's action in tabling
tho Gore resolution was received
calmly In ofllclal and other circles
here. Opinions are divided as to
whether or not this preliminary out
come of the discussion in the Amer
ican senate Is favorable to Germany.
It is asserted in Berlin olllcial cir
cles that Germany can not accept
what is termed "a new terra" reading
"attack In self-defense." It is argued
that such an attack Is just as much a
departure from the existing interna
tional law as would bo. In tho opinion
of President Wilson, a warning of
American citizens not to use armed
merchantmen. It Is pointed out that
Great Britain gave tho American gov
ernment explicit assurances that Brit
ish vessels wore and would be "armed
for defense only," and would never
attack.
A number or caBes are mentioned
by ofllcials hero where captains o!
armed vessels wero punished by the
British admiralty for not attacking
submarines. Olllclals of tho foreign
oillco profess confidence in what they
call "tho common sense of the Amer
ican people," and count upon It to pro
vent Americans from jeopardizing
their lives on armed merchantmen.
The final conclusion as emphasized
ty German officials after discussing
the new situation is that Germany in
tho circumstances could not deviate
from the conditions set forth in her
recent manifest to neutrals announc
ing the new submarine campaign.

Washington, March G. The flrst of
the national defense bills providing or
the Increase of the regular army and

140,000 men and a war strength of
170,000, an increase of 40,000 men and
7,433 officers. The bill drafted by the
senate committee provides for a reg
ular array with a peace strength of
178,000 men and a war footing of 220,
000 men.
By providing for the gathering up
of all men who have served with', the
regular army, or who have received

timates that on the enactment of the

plan when carried out is estimated at
?141,704,S4G, an increase of approxi
mately of $4G,000,000 of the regular

1917. The estimated cost of the plan
for the first year Is $116,000,000 and
at the end of the fifth year $137,

elements of the administration's army
plan prepared by former Secretary

times goes even further than the ad

GERMANS
CHECKED
By The French In Their
Heavy Rush
Attempt Mads to Break Through
Line Near Oouaumont,
ARTILLERY DUEL IN PROGRESS
French Entrenched In the Southern
Outskirts of the Village of Douau
mont, Which Is Still Held by the
Kaiser's Men Russians Report Ac
tivity On the Eastern Front Re
view of Day's Operations.
Paris, March 6. Another attempt
was made by the Crown Prince's army
to break through the French line near
Douaumont, north of Verdun, but the
line held and the Germans fell back
to their own trenches under tho fire
of the French artillery.
A German force attacked in the
wood iust north of Vacerauvllle, but
with no more success.
In the contest for the possession of
Verdun the operations have narrowed
for the time being to the short sector
about the plateau of Douaumont. The
Germans concentrated their artillery
hre on the restricted front between
the Houdromont wood and Douaumont
village. The bombardment was very
violent. After great quantities of
heavy shells had been thrown, the1
German Infantry made its charge at
Pere. The attacking waves at once
were brought under the fire of the
French guns, with which machine
guns and rifle firing co-operated, and
were unable to reach the French
tienches. At the village of Douau
mont Itself, where the Germans hold
the village proper and the French are
entrenched In the southern outskirts,
fighting of considerable liveliness oc
curred without changing the situation.
The German ofllclal statement an
nounces the evacuation by the Ger
man troops of the trenches captured
by them from the French near the
forest of Thiaville, northeast of Ba
donviller. In Loraine. The evacuation
was ordered to avoid unnecessary
losses under the concentrated fire of
the French artillery.
The German artillery continued Its
firing with intensity on the whole
front east of the Meuse and west of
the river at Lemorthomme and Cote
de l'Eire.
Along the entire Russian front ac
tivity has been resumed by both the
Russians and the Austro-German
troops. The initiative seems to be
largely on the side of the czar'&
forces, though the Germans .appear to
be preparing an offensive in the re
gion of Baronowitchi, an Important
railroad sector which has seen much
lighting throughout the last sir
months.
Unofficial dispatches from Bucha
rest report extensive Russian troop
movements in Bessarabia. The Co
logne Gazette estimates the Russian
I casualties in the recent lighting near
the Bessarabian frontier nt 133.000.
There has been another clash be
tween Bulgarian soldiers and Greek
frontier guards in the neighborhood of
Macikovo, on the Greco-Serb frontier.
New Zeppelin Raid.
London, March 6. A Zeppelin raid'
took place Sunday night, when two.
hostile airships crossed over tho
northeast coast of England. The offi
cial statement announcing the raid
gives no information as to the dam
age done.

Cleveland, March G. Less than live
hours after Aker, Folkman & Law
rence, steamship agents, discovered
that they had been the victims of a
systematic robbery of $3,183 intrust
ed to them to be sent to Europo, Emll
