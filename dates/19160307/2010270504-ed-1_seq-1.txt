William Adair, proprietor of tho
North Platto Laundry, lias brought
suit in tho district court of Pottuwatn
mlo county, lown, for $100,000 tor per
sonal injuries alleged to have hconl
sustained when an automobllo in
which he was riding turned turtle near
Big Sprigs, Nob., on Juno 10, 1914.
Adair Is suing the Colo Motor Co.,
which built the car In which he says
lie was hurt.
The petition sets forth that Gcorgo
Goffee of North Platte bought a slx
cyllnder Cole automobile on May 29,
1914, and that on tho dato of tho acol
denlt was taking Adair from this city
to Cheyonne, Wyoming. One of the
wheels broke, and tho car turned ovor
on Adair. He suffered a fractured
hip ad internal Injuries about the
heart and chest Tho grounds tor the
suit are that tho company was negli
gent In putting a car with defectlvo
wheels on the market.
The petition further sets forth that
the spokes were brittle, notwithstand
ing the fact that tho company adver
tised that the woodwork was cou
sructed of the bept material on tho
market, and .that tho car was a per;
fectly safe vehiclo for the transporta
tion of persons on a) public hlglnyny
while miming at a speed of thirty .to
forty miles per hour.
Tho sirit is attracting widespread at
tention because the plaintiff alleges
the 'manufacturing company Is liable
for an accident in which its car is in
volved after tho car has been sold to a
private individual.

the wife telegraphed the sheriff at
Bridsrenort to intercept Beatty and
nlace him under arest, which the offlo
or did, and ho was held until wifey
and her mother arrived. There was
somewhat of a "scene" when wire and
husand met, but the wife' promised to
never do it again, and tho re-unltcd
family returned home.
