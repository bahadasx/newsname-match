Service
According tb advices from Wash-
routes of IoWti, in which marfy Ham
11 ton county farmers are directly in
terested, has (ailed and the routes
will remaitf# tor the present at least,
as they were after the recent
changes.
Congressman Good of the Fifth
Iowa district introduced the follow
ing amendment to the postal bill,
which fajled of adoption:
"Provided further, that no part of
the sum hereby appropriated shall
be used to pay the salary of any rur
al carrier using a horsedrawn ve
hicle and carrying mail over any
.' route the major portion of -which is
over a dirt road, the total length of
which exceeds twenty-six miles."
In support of his amendment, Con
gressman Good said:
"Mr. Chairman, during the past
three years three distinctive visita
tions have come to the farmers of
the middle vest, each of which in
creased in its destructlveness to the
interest of the farmer. First, in
1913, our farmers lost about $40,
000,000 by hog cholera. Then, in
1914, the foot-and-mouth disease
spread over the central west, result
ing4 in tremendous loss to our farm
ers but itt 1&15 there came a vislta
tion, directed from the po&tofftce de
partment, wiiich was more destruct
ive to the real interests of the cen
tral west than any that had preced
es* it.
"f hat was a disruption of the rur
al delivery service .of the central
west. I do net believe that the mem
bers of this house who represent rur
al communities or who represent city
communities, where r.o such change
has been made in the 'rural routes,
can have any idea of the effect of
the order of the postmaster general,
by which rural routes were discon
tinued by tbe wholesale and new
routes were established where there
were no roads, over creeks where
there were do bridges, over roads
that are impassable, changes which
i-equire men to change their postof
flce addresses without their consent,
and compel them to select a postof
flce as their postoffice address from
eight to tea miles farther from their
"home than tbe one which had been
their postolR.ee address for many
years.
"If members will take the time to
consider the inconvenience of the
(today
'farmers and stock raisers who are
receiving their mail and daily
papers and their reports of the live
stock market some twenty-four hours
later than they did before the
changes were made, I think they will
tinderstand the real grievance of the
men who live on thetarm. who have

HEARS DEACONESS
Mils Joy Smith, Methodist Beacon-
ess, Here in Interest of the
Epworth league.
Miss Joy Smith, a Methodist dea
coness for ^his, tlie Forf Dodge dis
trict, is here for a. week in the in
terest of the Methodist Epworth
League and from the success of Sun
days meetings she will prove an
inspiration to all the young people
of the church and the league will no
doubt grow stronger for her having
been here. Miss Smith was present
at the league meeting Sunday night
and the evening church hour was
also occupied with an inspirational
talk by the deaconess.
Miss Smith's text was livened to
four classes of Epworth League
workers—the disciples. and their at
titude before th« crucifixion. One
class are tbe people on the edges or
fringes of the church, Sunday school
and league. They may have been
good church workers in the past, but
they have drifted aad become dis
interested. The second class are
most always present, but that's all.
They can never be depended upon/
When there is work to be done they
are never willing to take the initia
tive. The third class of people are
the "old standbys"—the kind who
teach in the Sunday school, lead the
league, hold the offices, etc. They
are fine but they lack somewhat in
enthusiasm. The fourth elate is a
body of young people whose enthus
iasm never dies. Zealous workers,
who work ardently when the excite
ment is over, are th«( kind all should
be to have the most successful
league. These latter are the kind
of workers Miss Smith hopes for in
the local league.

"The amendment. I have offered is
a limitation on this appropriation
and absolutely places the rural scr
vice inhere the* postmaster general
can not use a dollar of this money to
pay the salaries of the rural carriers
over dirt roads if that route is more
than twenty-six miles long. That is
two miles more than the standard
route, and it. was drawn intentional
ly with that in -view, in order to give
ttie postmaster general some leeway
in) establishing these routes."

KENYDN SAYS TO
WAX
lowaV Senior Senator Now at His
Dodge—Talks
a Little.
Fort Dodge, March 4.—Senator
Kenyon is home for a few dayd and
in a statement issued yesterday says:
"We urged Americans to come out
of Mexico, why not request citizens
of. our country to keep off armed
boats of belligerents? It would
seem to- be simply common sense.
"What shall be said of the patrio
tism of an American citizen who in
sists on a technical right to go oil
armed vessels, and by so doing pos
sibly plunge ihis country into war.
It is rather 'ap-sided' patriotism.
"While a nation owes a duty to
protect its citizens, the citizens owe
a duty not to embarrass their coun
try. To plwnge a- nation into war,
to vindicate the right to take pass
age on an armed boat, is, to say the
least, somewhat rash.
I introduced a bill, early in the
session, to prevent the issuance of
passports to persons taking passago
on boatb carrying munitions of war,
Passports ought to be refused those
insisting on traveling on armed ves
sels of belligerents.
"We are not going to get into this
war. Some things of course ar«
worse than war. One is dishonor,
but it can hardly be considered na
tional dishonor to request our-citi
zens tb help In keeping peace 'b^
staying home and attending to their
own business.
"We are not dealing with normal
people across the seas. They are war
mad. All doubtful international
questions may be held for solution
after this war is over, and after hot
heads have cooled off a bit. Let us
all keep qool, and not get hysterical
over the situation."
"Congress, I am sure, will take ra
tional steps for a reasonable prepar
edness. Preparedness is in the nat
ure of a national insurance. If we
are prudent men we carry life and
accident insurance. We are In no
hurry to have the policies paid. So
a strong navy Is in the nature of na
tional insurance. We can work out
the army plan through our state mi
litia.
"Our patriotism needs a divorce
from the pork, barrel. Members of
congress who will not vote for the
best interests of the. nation unless
some of the 'pork' appropriations
come to their state or district ought
to step out and their places should
be filled by those who believe it to
be their duty to vote for the inter
ests of the entire nation, and not
merely for the state or ^strict in
ther and a I which they live.''

The choruses are fetching and, the

That is the Advice of R. K. Bliss, of
the Iowa Agricultural
College.
"If you must buy seed corn, buy it
on the ear," advises R. K. Bliss, head
of the agricultural extension depart
ment at Iowa State College. "If is
the only way to b6 able to tell
whether the corn is an early matur
ing variety. Every seed company
should be made to sell its seed corn
in this way."
The returns from the seed corn
campaign in northern Iowa has just
been received. Conditions appear
serious. Farmers will most probably
have to import some of their seed
corn. Of samples tested from 54,€50
bushels, but 1,400 bushels tested 75
to 100 per cent strong, ear test 6,
300 bushels, 50 to 75 per cent strong,
and 9,800 bushels, 25 to 50.per cent
