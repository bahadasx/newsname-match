Vote Cast Late in
Afternoon.
Voting in South Bend at Indiana's
first primary today went off without
a hiu:h.
Early voting was tho rule in the
majority of the down town precincts.
In tho precincts farther out, the
polling went more slowly, but ward
leaders and political aspirants were
busy during the entire day marshal
ing their hosts. The rush at the
noon hour swelled the total number
of voters at the primary consider
ably. No serious delays were encount
ered in the voting. The Australian
ballot system, which it was expect
ed would work a hardship on the
working men who had only a short
time either early in the morning or
at noon in which to cast their bal
lots, did not take as much time as
anticipated. The fact that three
booth.- .vere maintained in each pre
cinct facilitated the voting.
It was estimated in the down town
districts, that from 60 to 75 per cent
of the 1914 registration would turn
out today before the polls close at
night. In the city districts farther
out. the voting was heavy. The
sixth ward voters were coming reg
ularly and it was expected that al
most the total number of voters will
cast their ballots before 6 o'clock.
Confusion Over Boundary.
A little confusion in the third and
fourth precincts of the sixth ward
as to the boundary lines of the pre

cincts were changed recently by the
county commissioners so that they
were more evenly divided In ono
precinct before the change was made
there were over COO voters and. it
was decided, this required too much
time to compute the reuirns.
In the third precinct of the sixth
ward up until noon a heavy demo
cratic vote had been cast. There
were only a few republican ballots
called for by the voters in this
precinct. In most of tho precincts
there "were only a few progressive
votes polied and in many there were

INSIST ON RESPECT FOR

But Foolhardy Citizens Who
Endanger Peace of Na

ated. Internn'tiennl News ServFe:
WASHINGTON. March 7. The
house of representatives today cap
itulated to Pres't Wilson.
Tlie tirst test vote on proposals to
warn Americans off belligerent
firme.l ships, showed that the forces
of the administration were in com
plete control. By a vote of 2"oS to
160 the house carried a, motion to
limit debate on the special rule for
the consideration of the MeLemore
warning resolution.
The administration program call
ed for Lur hours' lebate on the
MeLemore measure followed by a
motion X lay it on the table. The
first vote indicated that the pro
gram would go through easily.
The vote came in the midst of a
day of sensational debate, such as
the house has seldom seen. Pleas
for support for the president who
has "carried the greatest national
responsibilities of any president
since Lincoln," aroused the house to
wild enthusiasm.
Warnings that no nation "divided
against itself shall stand," were re
ceived in solemn silence. Excoria
tion of American citizens whose
"foolhardiness and recklessness" in ,
traveling on belligerent ships may '
"plunge the countrv into war." was'
cheered.
Whole llmivc ('Lcvr.
The final argument and appeal
which aroused the house most was
the demand that this country stand
firm behind the preside nt in his linht
to insure- respect for the- rights of
American citizens on the sea.
To this plea the Pig memlrship
on the I'oor and the crowd which
overflowed the galb-rie. and corri
dors, rose with cheers and ap
plause. The gra v -ha ii -d. stalwart, erect
form of Speaker Clark stood at the
desk and his hand wielded the gaved
vigorously, but impotently, in 111 sj
efforts! to restrain them. At times
the house was in tumult.
When the- vote was announced a
hush of silence swept over the cham
ber, followed by a siiih of relief, as
the members and th crowd realized
that the presbieni was sure of a big
