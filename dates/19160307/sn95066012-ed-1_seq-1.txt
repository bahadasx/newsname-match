Bennington County ortsmenPlan
to Restore Inteiesting Fauna
BREEDING STOCK EASILY SECURE
Castor Canadensis Would Build Dams
on Streams and Improve Trout
, Fishing.
Tbe officers of the Bennington Coun
ty Forest, Plsb and Game association
held a meeting in the office of tbe sec
retary, William H. Wills, Monday eve
ning to review the work of the associ
ation and make future, plans.
, The most interesting bit of work
transacted was tbe motion to plant
several colonies of beaver along the
mountain streams in Bennington coun
ty. Beaver have entirely disappeared
from this part of the country. To pre-
'vent a re-ocurrance of this, it has been
proposed that the Fish and Game as
sociation, in conjunction with Com
missioner Titcomb, purchase the beav
er and care for them. The state law
does not allow an open season on
beaver.
It is a well-known fact that the pres
ence' of beaver on a stream helps the
fishing, for trout are always to be
found in the ponds made by the beaver
dams. They are inoffensive little ani
mals and later there would be a rev
enue from the sale of pelts, after they
had a chance to multiply and their
killing regulated. ... They breed rapidly,
the increase being about 32 to 1 for
each generation. .
The association ; can procure the
number it desires from fish and game
headquarters in New York state at a
small cost It was decided that the
executive committee look into the
matter . and report more conclusively
at the next meeting.' v.
The officers also discussed at some
length the advisability of importing
several elk into Bennington county.
There is an abundance of the animals
in Wyoming from which t;. that-state
will gladly sell enough to Btart breed
ing in Vermont for about $5 a head,
Transportation charges would amount
to about $45 per bead before the ani
mals were freed and probably, not
more than a half-dozen would be
necessary. The Vermont cllmatej it ia
argued, is favorable to their propaga
tion and after a few seasons they
would be as plentiful as deor. This
action was also referred to the com
mittee for report later.
The association now has the largest
membership in its history, credit being
due to the membership committee
which has brought in 150 paid members
since the last meeting. The officers
are working for 250 members and the
prospects are excellent for securing
that number between now and July.
President Greenslet gave an inter
esting account of the recent Vermont
Fish & Game league convention In Bur
lington and reports of the officers
showed the association in a nourishing
condition.
STEAMER SINKS WITH 400
Pirncipe de Asturlas Goes Down Off
Brazil Coast.
Rio Janeiro, March 6. It is feared
here that four hundred lives have been
lost by the sinking of the Spanish
steamship Pirncipe de Asturlas. The
steamer remained afloat only a short
time after striking a shoal off San Se
bastian, and there was little time for
the escape of passengers and crew in
the boats. Steamers have gone out to
search for additional survivor 143 of
the passengers and crew already hav
ing been landed at Santos.

MIITY-OIIE BOYS
ROUNDED IIP AS
LAW BREAKERS
Need For Drastic Treatment of Ju
veflile Situation in Bennington
POliCE SUGGEST A CURFEW LAW
Parents of Score of Boys Should Be
Held Responsible for Acts of
15-Year Vagrants.
During the past month 21 boys, the
ages of none of which is over 15 years,
have been arrested by the village po
lice for petty robberies, nuisances and
vagrancy. Most of their lawless acts
have been committed around or after
midnight and some of the school facul;
ty in conjunction with the police, are
to appear at the meeting of the vil
lage trustees this evening and And out
if some action cannot be taken in the
forthcoming village meeting to have
a curfew law enacted for the village.
During the I'ast tnree days, four
more boys .have been taken Into cus
tody by the police. All cf those previ
ously arrested have been alleged
guilty of breaking and entering stores
in the village, liomes at Old Benning
ton and committing nuisances in the
halls and stairways of business
blocks. Their parents are indifferent
or have no apparent control over
them. The police are powerless to
act at present until after some obnox
ious act has been committed, for the
boys argue that lacking a curfew law,
they have as much right at anyone on
the Btreets, regardless of the hour.
With a currew ringing at a ociock. or
half-past, the officers would then
hare authority to take them into cus
tody if they appeared on the streets
thereafter. ., '
There are several places about the
blocks of the villago that the boys
have used for sleeping quarters, to
which they return after their acta of
thievery, manv of them not returning
ftorh'e all fhlght.!: It Is argued that the
etirfew will entalf hardly any expense
to the village and will give the officers
something to ' act' uptw and ' prevent
rooceurances' of- their acts in tb " fu
ture. : SupL Varney - is ! heartily in.
favor with the proposed curfew,-trod
would like to have It come before) the
village meeting even though it is-too
late tp.appear in the warning,, .
:.. THE STATUS OF WOMEN , i
Address at Fortnightly By Prof. G. G.
Great.
At the Fortnightly on Saturday af
ternoon Prof. George G. Groat of the
University of Vermont spoke on "The
Changing Industrial Status of Wo
men." That the change in the last
century is a great one, we all realize;
but the fact that it is as yet only In
its first stages, is never so clearly
brought out as when statistics are
used to show the increase In percent
age of the woman's part as a producer
in the mercantile world. "
It was centuries after men came to
gether as industrial producers, before
they realized that only by organization
could they better their -working condi
tions; and through organization came
legislation backed by public opinion.''.
In this way came about all -the
changes that make for the botterment
of social conditions today, and it must
be the same in the newer field. Wo
men must first learn the lesson of or
ganization, , then legislation' comes
naturally and the man and woman arc
side by side and will so stand in the
future.
While statistics are a tiresome part
of many lectures, they are to the stud
ent most powerful factors in showing
the direction of future growth, and In
this case they can hardly be far from
the truth.
During the opening business session
the club members officially noted the
death of their esteemed vice-president,
Mrs. Lester Hutchinson Nichols, by
passing resolutions of regret, not only
expressing their sense of a personal
loss, but also that of a loss to the com
munity at large.
The nominating committee for the
annual election on April fifteenth was
elected: Mrs. Mary Adams, chairman,
Mrs. G. 'Philip Endress . and Mrtf.
Harry S. Moses.

of Verdun, has been taken with 300
prisoners. The smash against Verdun
has been continued in un attack upon
Hill No. 2G5 near Regneville. The
infantry attack was preceded by a
vigorous bombardment.
Paris, March 6. The crown prince
late this afternoon toward the close
of the fourteenth day of the battle for
Verdun launched his first infantry at
tack from the northwest.
On a front of two and a half miles,
between Bethlncourt and Forges, on
the western bank of the Meuse, where
the French advanced line baa been
battered by artillery intermittently
since March 1, a "drum fire" which
lasted throughout the afternoon, sud
denly was halted and the infantry was
sent into violent attack. I was Intend
ed to take the village cf Forges and to
push forward and storm a hill of vital
strategical Importance, the Cote de
1'OIe, due south of Forges, in the loop
of the Meuse.
Only the first of these goals was
reached. The French official mid
night communique announces the Ger
mans took Forces and are Holding it.
Fierce onslaughts ou the Cote de l'Oie
broke down under the enlllading tire
of the French. :
with this attack the battle of Ver
dun entered into Its third phase, long
expected the attack from the north
west. It Is aimed immediately at tbe
triangle of forte guarding Vordun
from the northwest, and ultimately at
the whole defense line on the left
bank of the Mouse, .
The French ornmuhirlue does - net
indicate the' violence' of this' now; Inj
tantry'" ''attack'' beyond "'oalUris ;s:lt

battle" followed and resulted 1n ?tha

Verdun fortress proper; -IM chief. Im
portance lies in its domination of the
Cote de" l'Ol'e, a teeraendous hatafaj
obstacle on the path to the" -northwest
tern forts. ' ' ' '
By establishing the line between
Bethlneourt and Forges, it Is feared
the Germans have made an important
step toward quasi-junetion between
the armies on the right and left
banks of the Meuse, the river now be
ing practically the only thing between
them. Brabant, Samogneux and
Champneuvilie on the eastern bank
are held by the German center and
their line runs parallel' with the Beth-Incourt-Forges
line.
Due south of Bethhicourt lies Le
Mort Homme, repeatedly reported by
Paris to be unrlcr ftro of German guns!
