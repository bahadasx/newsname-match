London, Mar, 7. The British. gov
ernment has adopted a new plan that
will eliminate-. many, .of the incon
veniences now suffered by American
shippers because of the blockade, the

a$ London, Great Britain in the fu
ture will notify American shippers
before their goods leave American
ports whether they will be permitted

will make it unnecessary In the fu
ture for British warships to make
sfcisures, resulting In long contro
versies. :,''' '.. '''.'
Adoption ot this plan is one ot the
rst Important results of the eleva-
tl on of Lord Cecil to a position In
