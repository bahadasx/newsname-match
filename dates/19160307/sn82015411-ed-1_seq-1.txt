GIVE RECITALS
Mmc Augcttc Forct, a charming
vocalist who has been delighting
Honolulu audiences for sometime
unci will sail shortly for Japan-will
give two recitals on Kauai, the first

the second at Lihue Monday even
ing. She will arrive on the steam

turn to Honolulu Tuesday night.
Mine Foret will be introduced by
Mrs. Eric A. Kmulsen.
K Speaking of her singing, one of
the Honolulu newspapers had the
following, in a writeup of a recent
concert given there:
A performance, clever in acting,
dainty in artistic effect, intensely in
teresting and worthy of profession
als was that given at the Opera
House on Wednesday afternoon
and Thursday evening under the
auspices of the Free Kindergarten
Association.
Too much can not be said of the
charming personality of Madam
Foret and of her interpretation of
the rythmic ballads of her repetoire.
Her listeners were delighted, and so
pleased that they bad the opportuni
ty of hearing her again, for when
bo was here last year, her stay
was so short and so many people
were away at the Exposition.

RAIN INTERFERED
N. G. R.
"The rains descended and the
floods came and l)cat upon"-tbat
militiary dance at Makaweli Satur
day evening, and sad was the effect
thereof ,
Most of the society folk from Kc
kaha to Lihuc, and, perhaps, Ihj
yond, had planned to attend the
dance and see all the brass buttons.
Regimental and battalion and com
pany officers, far and near, fully in
tended to Ik; there, and it was to
have leen a brilliant affair. But
the weather man was on his bad
behavior, -and it rained most nf the
late afternoon and until 10 o'clock
at evening.
About thirty or so reached the
scene of festivities, however, and
proceeded to have a good time,
whether or no. The affair, al
though endingsmall, was very much
enjoyed by those fortunate enough
to reach the ball.
Company 8 Divided
Company B, o f the National
Guard, assembled at Lihue park
Sunday afternoon and was divided
into two companies, to conform to
the new regimental arrangement
the two companies becoming H and
C. Company B was a very large
aggregation, so that the change to
two companies was quite simple.
Captain Rice, who becomes major,
bade adieu to his men as their imme
diate commander and turned them
over to Captains Moragne and Car
den. Heavy Rains Fell
Heavy rains have been the rule
all over Kauai for the past four or
five days. Lihue, which usually
shows alMiut the island average in
general rains, had G.57 inches in
the period between Thursday night
and Monday niorning.Suiulay night
there were high winds, S., S-W.,
but no damage of imiortanee was
reported.
New Japanese School
The contractors will begin work
in a very few days on the proposed
new Japanese (Christian) church,
school and parsonage to go on the
premises next to Hon. W. H. Rice's
residence, in Lihue. The buildings
will be modern and quite attractive.
It is said that the parsonage will lc
a model of convenience. Prominent
people of Lihue are supplying most
of the money for the improvement.
.Manager F. A. Alexander and
R. L. Hughes, of Eleele, were pas
sengers in the Kinau Saturday
night for the city.
WITH
SITE GROSEN
FOR
UHUE'S
The site has been picked out for
Lihue's big armory. The building
will go on the fenced lot hack of
the county building, but at the end
toward the baseball park, so that it
will be open to plain view from the
road. Moreover, it will be close to
the park, which will be used a great
ileal as a drill ground.
The front of the building (which
will be the long side) will be simi
lar in appearance to the general
characteristics of the county build
ing front, and will be quite strik
ing. The drill hall, which will
be the largest hall on the island,
will be used, bv permission of the
Fourth Regiment on occasions, for
conventions and large gatherings
of various sorts. Care will be ex
ercised, however, to see that it
does not interfere with the success
of the fine, new theater, to go on
the Hale Hooni site shortly .which
will also be a public institution of
importance and the greatest value.
Tentative plans of the armory
are being worked over again and
the final plans will be ready very
shortly.
The Lihue Plantation Company
donates $6,500 to the Lihue arm
ory and Hen. George N. Wilcox
gives the balance, which will prob
ably be in the neighborhood of $3,
500. It is hoped that the armory
may be completed, fitted up and
ready for use for the big regimen
tal affair planned for July Fourth.

NEED IMMEDIATE
TARIFF CHANGE
Washington, Feb. 21. The Re
publican Publicity Association,
through its President, Hon. Jona
than Bourne, Jr., today gave out
the following statement n t its
Washington Headquarters
"Every day's delay in the reen-
acttnent of a protective tariff is an
increase in the menace to perma
nent industrial prosperity in the
United States.
"In one ol his recent speeches
in favor of military preparedness
President Wilson said he knew not
what a daj or an hour might bring
forth. If that be good reason for
immediate uiilitarv pieparation, it
is no less a reason for immediate
legislation for industrial prepara
tion. While it is true that on any
day the United States tiny be
thrown into the war, it is equally
true that on almost any day peace
may be declared in Europe, in
which event the abnormal demand
for American products woud tease
and there would be turned into
American markets a long delaved
flood of European products to be
sold in competition with American
products, with disastrous results
that no student of our industrial
history can doubt.
"If President Wilson and his
party are in need of facts, they
need not await the investigation
and report of a tariff commission.
The reports of the Department of
Commerce during the present ad
ministration have dcnioustratea
beyond possibility of dispute the
injurious effects of the Underwood
tariff law. There may be some room
for discussion as to the exact rate
of duty that should be established,
but there is no room whatever for
question tint the rate prescribed

in the Underwood law are grossly
inadequate for the purposes of
either protection or revenue.
"During the 10 months the Un
derwood law was in full force be
fore the war began, President Wil
son received at frequent intervals
statistics showing the increase in
imports of foreign products sold
in competition with the products
of American labor. He had btfore
him everv week a report of com
mercial and manufacturing failure s
which showed the result of those
importations upon American fac
tories. He read dailv reports of
the steadily increasing army of
unemployed, who had lost their
jobs in order that foreign work
men might be provided with em
ployment. He has had before him
continually the specter of a de
pleted Treasury. Yet he pretends
to believe it necessary that a tariff
commission be created and be giv
en time to investigate and report
before legislation shall be had up
on the subject of import duties.
"If facts are what President
Wilson and his party waul, they
have them now. If obstruction is
all they desire, the creation of a
tariff commission will serve their
purpose. If, in a spirit of loyalty
to American interests and a desire
to place 'America first', they wish
