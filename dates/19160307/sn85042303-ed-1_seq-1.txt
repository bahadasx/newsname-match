Kl I'aso, Tex., March V. Although
the death list remains at eighteen in
the jail explosion here last night, sev
eral more are expected to die.
The explosion took place in a dis
infecting room, where there were fifty
prisoners. A lighted match ignited
the vapors arising' from the bath,
It being a mixture of gasoline, kero
sene, and vinegar.
An inquest and city investigation
were ordered today.
More than a Fcore. of prisoners,
who were thoroughly saturated with
the solution, were enveloped in flames.
Jail attendants immediately opened
two exits from the room, which per
mitted most of the prisoners to es
cape the flames. The cells immedi
ately adjacent, to the bath room were
caught in the flames and it was here
that most of the fatalities occurred.
Volunteer rescuers aided in drag"
ging out the victims, many uncon
scious and badly burned. The fire
department, quartered in the same
building, extinguished the blaze be
fore it had spread to other parts of
the jail.
About fifty unharmed prisoners
were removed from cells on the same
Moor and placed in quarters on the
second floor of the building, under
heavy police guard.
