Will Be Built on Manley
Property, Cleveland Ave.
Near Main.
BY THE U I.COMPANY
Matter Will Be Decided at
Director's Meeting Tues
day Evening.
ing exclusively for doctors and dent
ists, with a spacious arcade lined with
shops on the first, floor, If the plans of
the Fairmont Building and Investment
company are working on are approved
at the next meeting of the directors.
The site of the proposed building
is the Manley property on' Cleveland
avenue, which section wan formerly
called Barney street. This Manley
property la between the Arnett pro
perty on the corner of Cleveland ave
nue and Main street, and the Cochran
property, on Cleveland avenue.
Tlio Building and Investment com
pany own both lots between the
Cochran residence and the South Side
bridge. But until the proposed plan of
a new bridge acroBS Coal'Itun is deci
ded no building will be erected on the
corner lot
The proposed building on the Man
ley lot will be four stories in height
and constructed entirely of modern
fireproof material. The tentative plans
are for a building about 60 feet wide
and 75 feet long.
The entrance will he on Cleveland,
avenue and a well lighted arcade will
run through the center of the building.
On each side of the building the first
floor will have a row of shoprooms
with entrances facing thq arcades.
The three upper floors will be reach
ed by ample elevator facilities and
will be designed to contain about 25
office rooms each. It is the idea of tbe
company to have each room an outside
room wjth plenty of sunlight and the.
best ventilation possible.
The offices will have sound-proof
partitions between, and will be es
pecially constructed to meet the re
quirements. of physicians and dentists
who desire easily accessible rooms In
quiet surroundings.
Many prospective tenants liave al
ready asked for a sight of the plans so
that they might secure a lease early
and be sure of obtaining accommoda
tions. Probably 75 rooms In all will be
In the building, although the floor
plans will be elastic enough to meet
the reqirements of any desirable ten
ant.
It is the Intention of the company to
build the most desirable buUding"fcos
sibla for the professional men of the
community. The location of the pro
posed structure Is far enough away
from the car lines and the heavy traf
fic on Main street, to be quiet and
particularly well suited for the pur
pose.
This section is the best drained and
aired location which could be found
near Main street "The growth of the
city toward the southwest, has made
this section the nearest to the heart
of tbe city. The post office is only a
block away and all the streets In the
city converge toward the South Side
bridge corner. The street Is also well
adapted to the parking of automobiles.
Tuesday evening of next week Is tbe
time of the next regular monthly
meeting of the directors of the Build
ing and Investment company and the
building committee will report on the
tentative plans at this time. If the di
rectors of the company approve these,
an architect will be engaged to work
out the details of the new ivtitldlng,
and actual construction work started
as soon as possible. /
It In likely that the building will bo
ready for the tenants by next fall.
At present the site of the proposed
building is occupied by a two-story
frame residence. If the plans for the
building are approved, the work of raz
ing the present building will be be
gun immediately.

Commerce Chamber Com
mittee Instructed to In
vestigate Further.
[?'? PeirmontTieods -an indnatrlal agpnt
! That the securing of such a man for
the city would i? a..great for"
ward and would undoubtedly, do much
for the prosperity of the Mountain
City is admitted on all sides. It was
the object of a'special session of the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday at
which absolutely nothing was done.
The committee, appointed at a for
mer meetlng'of the body to. IWkJWto
the advisability of securing an indus
triar agent submitted, a report which
amounted to the following: That they
heartily recommend that such a man
be secured; that the money to defray
the expenses would have to come from
private subscriptions; that a fund of
about $6,000 be raised lor the purpose,
and that a committee of three be ap
pointed to organize a campaign for the
amount stipulated and secure pledges
for. the same.. ? ? ?
A general discussion followed, in
which It was pointed, out by several
speakers that It would be folly to go
out and ask the people of Fairmont to
subscribe to an Indefinite proposition
with the hope of. getting any response,
and that It would be far better to Be- (
cure au option on a suitable man and
then go out and see If the money couui ,
be raised before making a binding con
tract. After looking over the possible
candidates for the position, finding out
what salary they would demand, ana
how long a ternfthey wished to con
tract for, It was thought that at that
time, with the facte, to; the case as a
working basis, It'tfould be time to tali
of organizing a subscription campaign.
A motion was passed instructing the
! committee to deliberate, further and
to get more specific information on
the vital IsaueT-When, the committee
is ready to report/ again, a meeting ot
the Chamber of Commerce will be call
ed But no far as Immediate action is
concerned, the industrial agent ques
tion has no chance. .
According to evidence introduced
at the meeting yesterday, the new

Galleries Were Quickly Filled With People/)
Opera Glasses And Fortified With Li
Boxes and Milk Bottles
Struggle on Floor of the House Was Preceded?1
the Barbershop Between Two Attendants^
With Toilet Water Bottles.
(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, March 7.?Prompt
ly at 11 o'clock the House assembled
for the all day fight of the administra
tion forces to kill the McLemore reso
lution to warn Americans oft armed
shlpB of the European belligerents
Speaker Clark was in chair and act
ing Chairman Pou of the Rules com
mittee was In his seat ready to submit
the special rules under which the de
bate will proceed. Prospects of a sen
sational-debate attracted a record
crowd to the Houbo long before the
doors opened. Men, women and chil
dren came ready for a long stay. Lunch
boxes, mliic bottles, opera glasB and
books formed the principal part of
their equipment. When the Pub
lic galleries were opened there was a
rush and scramble and the galleries
were filled within five minutes.
As a preliminary to the big fight In
the House there was fight of quite a
different nature in the House barber
shop. Two of the negro barbers there
who cater to the representatives
brought their argument to a close with
a fusillade of toilet water bottles ?nd
other barber shop accessories, accom
panied by a running flre of language
which was far from parliamentary.
The ? House police force ended the
row by clapping both combatants in
the lockup.
The spirit of the combat seemed to
be In the air. As soon as the Jour-1
nal bad been read, Mr. Pou offered the
privileged resolution containing the'
special rule. He asked unanimous
consent for a ninety-minute .debate
on the rule. There was no objection
and 'the debate began. Mr. Pou took
the floor to open the fight. The first
outburst of 'applauBe came at the out
set of his speech wtfieif ho said:
"All the Imps of Hell never de
vised' a more infamous lie1 than
the declaration that has been
made.that President Wilson wants
war."
Representative Campbell of Kan
sas, Republican member of the Rules
committee, announced when Mr. Pou
concluded that If the motion to close
the debate on the rules were defeated
he would offer a substitute for the
McLemore resolution which would be
a direct warning to Americans to keep
off armed ships.
At the end of the debate of an hour
and one-half on the rule a vote on a
motion for "the previous question"?
a motion to end the debate on the rule
itself, was In order. That under the
plan of the leaders would bo the first
roll call. Then a yote on the adoption
of the rule Itself was In order, taking
a second roll call. The adoption 01
the rule meant four hours debate on
the McLemore resolution Itself with
another roll call at the close on a mo
tion for disposition of the resolution.
This generally was expected to be
a motion by Chairman Flood of the
Foreign Affairs committee to table
it r
The expectation of three roll calls
was based on the assumption that the
rule would be carried and did not take
into consideration any unexpected par
liamentary tactics from the opposition.
Mr. Pou attackafl the McLemore res
olution at the outset. "It means in
effect that if an American disregards
a warning that the United States Gov
ernment will fold Its hands," said he,'
"Is there's single! red-blooded citizen
in this House or this country who
wants to do that?
"It is charged that the President
wants war. All the imps of Hell never
devised a morej Infamous charge. No
man since Abraham Lincoln has gone
through such "a, test as the President
has gone through in the last six
months. He has tried to preserye
peace. :He would not sacrificed sin
gle life tO;make: himself president for
a life terin, The',has the'sumort or both
sides of.this chamber'.- -He'faas support
on the Democratic and distinguished
support on the other side. Only
the. other day I read a statement of
former President Taft's suporting
him."
Applause on both sides of the Cham
ber followed his remarks.
When Representative Caabell, Re
publican, arose to speak he read a
substitute he said he would 'propose
if a motion to end debate on the Rules
did not carry. It was as follows:
