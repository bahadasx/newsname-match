mun, waited upon the board of countv
commissioners yesterday mtrning and
solicited eo-operution upui. the part oi
me board in the matter of leiieving the
worthy j,,.tl,. cf chic-kasha and vicinity.
Mayor Coifman introduced the mem
bers of the committee to tie board and
miormea i!;e board of tt-.u object of
the visit. The mayor told ibe coaunis-
sioner;i of the good work -which the
United tharitiej werj doing, of the
efforts to ameliorate the sufferings
of distressed humanity; of the manner
'n w hich every case was inquired into
und of the promptness with which aid
was rendered in all worthy cases; of
lhe efforts of the Charities to feed and
clothe and provide for those in need
through no fault of their own; of how
iiU.e children were being sent to
school through the aid of the United
Charities, children who otherwise
would be growing up in ignorance.
Mayor Cowman closeii bis remarks in
troducing the members of the commit
tee by asking thar the members of
the beard of county commissioners
would listen favorably to the plea
which would be made and would, if
they possibly could, afford the aid
sought. Judge Grigsby followed the
mayor with similar remarks.
Mrs. F. E. Riddle, on behalf of the
committee and the United Charities as
a whole, then addressed the commis
sioners and presented the matter to
them in a clear and a concise manner
f-he stated, in part, that by turning
over a small allowance to the United
Chatitics, in lieu, of following the form
now being pursued by the commission
ers, much greater good could be done
and a'( a far less cost to the ccpnty.
Mrs. Kiddle told of the manner in
which the ladies of the charities gath
ered cast-eff garments of the ones who
had in plenty; of how the clothes were
cut'd6wn and worked over, the trous
ers of tho men folk being transformed
into trousers for the "little men;" of
how clothing for little girls was made
by the sewing circle of the charities;
cf how underclothing was provided
at a minimum ccst; of how help from
the county, given as needed would ma
terially aid in the matter of reliev
ing the immediate needs of those ir. f
dire distress and would be handled at
a saving to the tax payers and with
greater benefit to those in need than
can be done by following the present
methods.
Mrs. Riddle told the commissioners
of the manner in which the homes o!
those upon whom life had turned the
frown in place of the smile, were vis-i
lted: of words of hope that were)
spoken to them and messages of gooc
cheer brought to them; of how condi
tions were relieved, sanitation taught,
children clothed and schooled and work
provided for unemployed heads of
families. Mrs. ruddle stated that s!?3
knew the coi-nty commissioners had
been told that they could not render
assistance in this manner, but that she
also knew that the man who had in
structed them to this effect was an
accountant ar.d not a lawyer, and not
be ng a lawyer could not properly in
terpret the laws.
Chairman Corzine, on behalf of the
board thanked the ladies for the man
ner in which they had presented the
business on hands and said that the
commissioners would take the matter
up and would thoroughlyVonsider it,
taking advice upon how to act and
would, if possible, act favorably. The
chairman assured the ladies o tflie

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 7.
Placing in operation today for the first
time their ne;v state-wide primary
law, Indiana voters went to the polls
to choose candidates for the Demo
cratic, Republican and progressive par
ties. Prior to the piimary it became evi
dent that the law is unpopular among
(he candidates. Several candidates
who withdrew from the contest stated
that the primary law necessitated elab
erate and expensive campaigns for the
nomination, which prohibited office
seeking by the man of moderate means.
Some o fthem have estimated that each
of th? Ne Goodrich and Watson cam
paigns has been fianced at not less
than $100,000 cost.
The second choice voting clause of
the law, designed to insure nomina
tions at the primaries, has caused
complicated ballote. It prevented the
use of voting .nachines. It was esti
mated thru, from a week to ten days
will be consumed in making tho official
count.
Estimates of the cost of the pri
mary to the counties range from $300,
COO to $700,000.
Because Woodrow Wilson and Thos.
R. Marshall had no opposition for the
preferential votes for president and
vice president and Charles Warren
Fairbanks was the unopposed candi
date of the Hoosier Republicans for
president, chief interest centered iu
the choic-3 of nominees for governor
f-nd United States senator. Three cor
nered fights for the Republican nomi
nation for United States senator and
governor gave to those contests more
rivalry and interest than Indian Re
publicans have experienced for a long
timo.
James Eii (Jim) Watson, former
whip of the house in "Ur.cle Joe" Can
non's regime, stirred Republican chan
nels from Gary to Evansville and from
Terre Haute to Fort Wayne in his cam
paign fo rthe senatorship nomination,
lie approximated a house to house can
stite, sDeiking- in drug stores and ou
corners in every town of any size.
Because of his campaign and his
handshaking policy, Watson today may
have a .slight advantage over Harry
S. New and Arthur Robinson. New ;
entered the race late, after the element
opposed to Cannon's whip decided ha
was making headway. Other candi
dates withdrew ona l-y one, each an
nouncing for New and trying to throw
their strength to him.
While the New and Watson cam
paigns have been elaborate and ex
pensive, Robinson, comparatively a
newcomer in politics, has relied al
most entirely upon his personal ef
forts, announcing for "a new deal in
polities'' and state-wide prohibition.
New and Robinson are from Mariou
county (Indianapolis).
Of slightly less interest was the raca
between James P. Goodrich, Warren
T. McCray and Quiney A. Meyers for
the Republican nomination for gover
nor. Goodrich, national committeeman
for Indiana, possibly is the leading
candidate. McCray, a successful stock,
raiser, was courting cn a strong vote
from the farmers.
The only contest of state importance
before the Democratic voters was that
of J. A. M. Adair and Leonard P.
Clore for the gubernatorial nomina
tion. "While Clore generally was con
sidered th- "anti-machine" candidate,
he has public ly stated that he does not
care to be so classed and Adair ha
maintained fiat he is the cmdidate of
no faction. Clcre entered the raci
late. Because of Adair's bacons? h
was considered possibly the leading
candidate, ('lure is a farmer. Adair
