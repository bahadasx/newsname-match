there were no new d -velopment t ll t,during
last week on the sib far 1 \]vr
view of polities, still the jockey- ;j.o "
ing for position among the poli- ^jon.
ticians continues unabated, and j. [
behind the screen which effect- '
ively shuts out the public gaze. ^
the manoeuvring has been no- niar|
ticeable. Something may crop ()^ j

which will have a decided bear. q0j
ing on the while situation. ; ..V
Those in close confidence ! attit
Governor Manning have not seen
fit to make public any comment
on the various announcements of j hear
candidates, both active and pros- cour
pective, who will contest witli
the Governor for the nomination j^at
at the hands of the Democrats na\j(
in the coming primaries for the n^rv
position of Chief Magistrate. maj<
That the friends of the Govern- |j(
*>r are keeping in close touch wenWith
the situation and are watch- cour
ing closely every move on the political
chessboard is known, but
they are not talking for publi- \ \7
cation. They are evidently of j
the opinion that watchful wait- |? j
ing is the best policy which can ,
be pursued for the present, for
they are known to feel that it is1
still too far away from the cam- j _
naien for the different elements
and issues to be clarified, that YilCii
there will be much shirting and i
changing in their opinion between
now and the opening of i, '
the campaign. : an
While Governor Manning has! r
not formally announced his can-|,nan
didacy for re-election it is known mon
that he will run. Hgeil
Several up-state papers this

he was in the race for re-elec- j Hasj!

Solicitor R. A. Cooper, of Lau- '1081(
rens, and Mr. W. A. Stuckey, of i ne s,
Bishopville, will do. That both are
being urged to enter the race ,1"
for Governor is known through-11)
out the length and breadth of
the state. The attitude of So- . '
licitor Cooper and Mr. Stuckey V1
will have a most important bear \ ,
ing on the outcome of the cam-;?f?'
paign in the opinion of well post- f

that he will seek election to the 1 a'
