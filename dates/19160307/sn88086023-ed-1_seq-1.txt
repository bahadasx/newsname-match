and says: "Therefore be It re-
solved that the house of repre- 4
sentatives request the president

Americans from traveling on

avoid war is to warn Americana to

ttying to confuse It. Chlpperfleld

president's policy meant either war or

"The real Issue,'' asserted Graham,
"is whether congress intends to mind
