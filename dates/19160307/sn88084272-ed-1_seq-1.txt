H Alonxo Bright of the Methodist

vention with all of the delegates and
speakers standing while it was said.
Dr & H Kirkbride. of Chicago, was
the chief Bpeaker at the morning ses
sion and he took the opportunity to
pay a tribute to the work of the early
Catholic missionaries in America and
said "To the braverj courage and
faith of these earlj fathers we owe the
fact that Christ has been brought to
the Indian of the United States and the
Mexican The only misfortune has been

He sa.id that, while in all of the

more than a million and a quarter of
Mexicans, that thej constituted a mis

that he did not like the distinction be
tween home and foreign missions, char
acterizing America as the greatest for
eign mission country of the world in
proportion to Its population because of
its enormous foreign population and
constant influx of foreigners
"It is true that the Mexican and the

It Is not exactly the right conception.
