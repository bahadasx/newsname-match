The following changes have
been made in the schedule of
Inures liy the Rev. Hugh
Hlack:
Tomorrow and Thursday tlie
lectures will !? Riven at 7:30
li. in., instead of 2 and S p. in.,
respectively. No classes are
excused tomorrow or Thursday.
The address Friday will be
given at 10 a. in., as previously
announced. Classes will be ex
cused during the hour 10-11 a.
m.. on that day. This lecture
will have more of an education
al, and less of a strictly reli
gious, character.
Favorable remembrance of his for
mer visits to the University was
abundantly attested by the large audi
ence which filled the University Audi
torium last night to hear the first of
the five lectures to be given during
Religious Week hy the Rev. Or. Hugh
lllack of IMiion Theological Seminary.
NeW York, on "The Teachings of
Jesus."
This first lecture Doctor lllack de
voted to getting out of his way what
he called the "introductory stuff." He
discussed the sources, background,
purpose and methods of the teachings
of Jesus, whom he called the greatest
master and teacher the world has ever
known.
"It is a fearful loss not to have the
words or the Master written down for
us," said Doctor lllack. "and yet we
may be glad when wc think how the
Scribes might have made of them a
fetish. Jesus' real interest did not lie
in words at all. but in religion, and
his religious message lay in his per
sonality." Jesus I'M'd Personal Influence.
Doctor lllack said he believed that
Jesus purposely refused to leave a
written message, but gave himself to
train a few chosen men who were to
win the world to God through per
sonal influence, the method of all
great teaching anywhere. But we can
trust the teachings of Jesus though
they come to ns second hand. These
sources, he said, are the Synoptic Gos
pels, containing the story of Jesus life,
which was handed down from mouth
to mouth for long before it was writ
ten; the additions of the catechists,
. who found new material while teach
ing. Mid the work of revisers ana
editors.
Literalism in the study of the Gos
pels Doctor Hlack declared to be ab
surd. "The background of Jesus' teaching
was the ordinary categories of con
temporary Jewish thought. The world
was a geocentric world to him, just
as it was to other men of his time,
but the religious categories of the
world of his time were not his. They
were the law. the kingdom and the
-Messiah. He took account of these,
but did mot receive them without crit
icism," said Doctor Hlack.
Jesus Used Irony and Humor.
Doctor Hlack protested against the
attempts of scholars to build up doc
trinaire system or philosophy out or
Jesus' teachings, which, he said, were
spontaneous, locational and incidental,
rather than systematic. His method,
he said, was mot that of the Scribes
nor that of Socrates. He was ironical,
but the essential spirit of his teachings
was genial and gracious. He was a
master of epigram and paradox, but
what impresses the reader is not the
cleverness of his sayings but their
truth. His language was simple and
concise. He was a master of humor,
but we fail to appreciate it because
our eyes are blinded by traditional
attitude when we read his words,
doctor Hlack said that he hoped to
remove this taboo from religion.
"Teachers of religion fail because
they are nearly always abstract," he
said, "but Jesus gets right down to
what you call 'brass tacks.' When he
gives a general rule, he shows its
working out every time. . . . His
A Democratic Candidate
Wallace Crossley.
Wallace Crossley of Warrcnsburg,
state senator from the Seventeentn
District in the last General Assembly
is a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for lieutenam-govornor.
Mr. Crossley was educated at William
J-ewell College and the University of
Missouri. He formerly taught in ihe
State Normal School at Warrensburg.
He was representative of his county
in the Legislature for three terms and
in 11U2 was elected to the senate.
purpose was not to construct a system
but to inspire men to a higher life
to get them to give their lives to love.
One of the saddest things in church
history is that though men have never
quite lost sight of the teachings of
Jesus the emphasis has so often been
put on things that never interested
him at all. The creeds give little at
tention to the great ideas in the teach
ings." ,
PARABLES II.WK LESSONS TODAY
Dr. Hugh Hlack Tells .Hodern Signif.
inincr of Biblical Stories.
That growth depends on cultivation
and that man will lose his faculties if
he does not use them, lioth facts
gleaned from the parable of the tal
ents, are the lessons of life to the stu
dent, according to Dr. Hugh Hlack,
who gave his second lecture of Relig
ious Week in the University Audi
torium this morning.
Doctor Black holds that parables
are of two kinds; One type is treat
ed as if it were an allegory and is
given a mystical meaning; the other
type, as if the conception is nothing
more than amplified simile, to teach
onlv what is on the surface. "Of the
two, 1 favor the second interpreta
tion simply because parables were
not meant as allegories," said Doctor
Hlack. "Tlie important lesson of the j
parable is on tlie surface. The de
tails should not obscure the truth."
The speaker also emphasized tlie
psychological method of studying the
Gospels. "We want to know more
than the teaching; we want to know
the teacher," he explained. "Accord
ing to a true psychological law, the
kind of figures a poet or teacher uses
reveals his inner nature and outlook
on life. In Jesus' parable we find
llowers, birds and little children. He
had wide sympathy and a genial
outlook."
FARMERS' FAIR AGAIN THE TOPIC
Agrictilliir.il Students Are Showing
Interest in Their Annual F.ieut.
Among the signs of spring lately
becoming evident are the notices
or the Farmers' Fair. Groups are be
ginning to form In the Agricultural
Building to discuss the work; an air
of industry is again present. The
bulletin board is the bearer of the
surest signs of the coming event In
one corner is a placard proclaiming
that ideas for sideshows should be
turned in. To enforce tlie thought is
a picture of an earnest, but homely
clad, farmer talking through a
warped megaphone to the crowds
surrounding the "Horned llore" side
show.
On another corner of the board a
notice asserts that "spring and IV
parade are coining." To draw at
tention there is a young woman out
walking, followed by the unerring
eye of the noted character of cartoons.

ton to Look Into Matter.
Tho Columbia school board met
last night and appointed F. W. Nieder
meyer and Dr. J. li Thornton as a
committee to meet with a committee
of negro residents, to decide on tlie
question of submitting, at the next
election, a proposal to issue bonds for
a new negro school building, to he
built on the site of tlie present school.
A report from a committee repre
senting the negro residents was read.
The negroes asked for a $10,000 or
$50,0000 building, while the board
seemed to think that a $20,000 or $23,
000 building would be adequate. Su
perintendent J. K. Mcl'herson said to
day that by request of the school
board, he had been working on plans
for a $2.-.00 building.
Monday, April 21, the school chil
dren of Columbia will have a rest.
The board decided that one day was
enough to celebrate Faster. The
superintendent was instructed to have
the domestic science class of the high
school prepare a luncheon for the
Mothers' Club. The date will be set
later.
The board voted that the usual in
crease in the annual rate of taxatic
for the maintenance of school again
he asked for. Tlie rate, as provided
hy the state law. is 10 cents on the
$100. A rise of fiO cents is the usual
amount oled on in Columbia.

Unamended Measure Wil

I!y I'liiteil Press
WASHINGTON, .March 7. The
House of Representatives in a tumultu
ous session today went on record as
backing the President on the armed
merchantman question. The first test
vote resulted 2oC to 101 ill favor of
the administration's non-warning
policy.
By this vote the House refused to
permit an amendment to the warning
resolution, introduced by Representa
tive McLemore.
Immediately after the taking of the
first vote, a second roll call began on
the question of adopting a rule to
bring up the measure again. It was
evident early this afternoon that the
rule would be adopted.
It is thought that the final vote
upon the question cannot be taken
earlier than G or 7 o'clock tonight.
