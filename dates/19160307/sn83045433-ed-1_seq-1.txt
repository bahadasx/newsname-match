HOUSE DISCUSSES QUESTION
Bryan, at Luncheon, Urges Tabling of
McLemore Resolution-Doesn't
Advocate War on Wilson.
Being in committee of the whole to dis
'uss a homestead bill, the House yester
day emitted floods of inconclusive oratory
on the armed ship issue.
The Senate last week could not wait to
lbate before acting, and debated later
aider guise of discussing what Senator
Clarke called "this damn bill;" the House
could not wait for the time to act before
talking, and. the match being set to the
timber by Representative Gardner. the
members spluttered away in a debate
which Is only valuable as showing that
most of the Rerpublican members will try
to defeat an- rule for acting upon the
Mel.emore resolutions.
As a msjoritv of the Democrats secretly
sympathize wtith this purpose. there is a
ptssibility of such action today as will
relegate the Mctemore resolutions to the
calendar. never to be heard of again.
Two distinguished private citizens
dropped into Washington. and the infu
ence of their prese ce upon the course of
events is 'et to be determined. Col. E.
3. loumse, close friend of President Wil
son. was et the White House; Col. Will
tam J. Bryan. whose friendship is merely
-L matter of doubt. but to whom the Pres
ident owes is present high estate and
heavy responsibillties, lunched with a
party of ahout twenty anti-preparedness
Representatives. IHe did not call at the
White House.
Not to Fight Wilso.
Although the Bryan luncheon, at which
Representative Bailey, leader of the anti
preparedness forces, was host, was be
hind closed doors, little secrecy attached
to what was said. Contrary to expecta
tion, Mr. Bryan urged no fight on the
Presibent. based on the present situation
in the House.
He advised those present to vote for
the tabling of tie Mctamore resolution.
although he favored the passage of a
resolution warning Americans from arm
ed belligerent liners. But Mr. Bryan
based his acquiescence in the report of
the Foreign Affairs Committee. recom
mending the tahling of the resolutions
upon this section:
"We know that if the President reaches
a point in any negotiations with foreign
governments at w'hich he believes he has
exceeded his power, he will in the usual
way report all facts and circumstances
to Congress for its action.'
It is in order that this expression may
he written into the record that many
members of Congress are going to vote
for the report of the committee which
means the tabling of the resolution.
The paragraph. curiously enough, was
written into the report of this Democratic
committee by a Republican, Stephen G.
Porter, of Pittsburg.
"You say 'we know' the President will
do so and so," he was asked. "How do
you know?"
"Well, we don't know," was the
answer. "but stating it thus as a fact
is equivalent to serving notice on the
President that he is expected to submit
all gravely menacing matters to con
gress and we do not believe that in face
of that notification he will fail to do so."
Urges Defeat of Rule.
The debate in the louse yesterday be-,
gan with Representative Gardner's de
niunciation of .the apparent purpose to de
feat the rule for the consideration of the
McLenore resolution. Republican Leader
Mann responded in defense of the policy
of non-interference by the House in
foreign affairs at this moment. lie made
clear his opinion that a majority of the
House favor warning resolutions, though
not the verbose oines offcredl by Mc
Lemore.
White the House was in a furore
of debate in the resolution the Rules
C'ommnittee decided on the form of rue
under which the McLemnore resolution
will tbe b'rought in today. It provides
for four hours of general debate en
the measure, with an understandin'
that an, hour and a half of debate on
the rule itself is to be arranged for
by unanimous consent. This rule
would clear the way for a motion by
Representative Flood, chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, to lay the
McLemore resolution on the table,
If the House today defeats the rule
the McLemore resolution wIll simply
be laid aside, and no attention will
be paid to the President's request
for "fullest discussion and action,"
If the rule Is passed by vote of the
House -the question will then arise
on tabling the resolution, Should the
motion to table be defeated, the question
of the adoption of the resolutIons in their
present or any amended form will be be,

Finds New Way to
Forecast Weather
3y Study of Solar Conditions
W. F. Carothers Predicts Me
teorological Effect on Earth.
A new sstem of forecasting the
weather for three weeks in advance has
been discovered by W. F. Carothers, the
director of Carothers' private observa
tory, at Houston, Tex., and was made
public yesterday by Prof. Willis Luther
Afoore, head of the meteorological de
partment at George Washington Univer
sity and who was for many years the
head of the United States Weather Bu
reau.
Prof. Moore stated that the Carothers
discovery will enable forecasters to de
termine what the weather will be two or
three weeks in advance to a greater de
gree of accuracy than they can at the
present time.
"All storms are traceable back to
variations in solar intensity, or to pul
sations in solar intensity." said Prof.
Moore. "These pulsations can be as
definitely measured by the methods
found by Mr. Carothers, and the
weather forecast for two and three I
weeks in advance, as is done by the
methods now in use for two days
ahead,
"This feat of the Texas meteorolo
gist must be considered as the most
important discovery in meterological
science since Franklin drew lightning
from the clouds and identified elec
tricity. Mr. Carothers has, in fact.
found the key to the central law of
the weather.
"Science of the solar system has ta
ken a great step forward. It will now
be poscible to learn weeks in advance
the weather of certaIn days.
