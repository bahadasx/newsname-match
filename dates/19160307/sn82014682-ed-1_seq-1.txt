TREATED FAIRLY
Alleged Insanitary Condition
of No. 4 Reservoir Leads to
Warm Discussion
- That there is friction betwen ' the
workings of the territorial board of
health, and the Oahu loan fund com
mission became evident today during
a discussion that -arose at a meeting
of the latter body, relative to work
upen Reservoir No. 4, Nuuanu valley.
Acting Chairman Lester Petrie, A.
D. Castro and Mayor Lane, all express
ed dissatisfaction at the . manner in
which the health board has disdained
to correspond with -the loan fund com
mission,, sending letters Instead to
Governor Plnkham, and informing the
loan Jfund body that It could get inform
matkm iroBi the executive In regard: to
the insanitary condition of the big
reservoir.. ; "
'it Is not. fair to the commission the
way we are being treated,, declared
Mr. Petrie. iVWe come away from our
business and meet here a lot, but we
don't deem to accomplish anything."
. Mayor. Lane declared that the com
mission is "wasting its . time", under
the present condition oL things, and
Mr. Castro thought the board of health j
was not doing its duty if it failed to ;
make known to the public that the big ,
reservoir Is insanitary.
A motion was passed unanimously
at the close of the discussion, the
sense of which was that, whereas the
commission has requested certain re
commendations of the board of health, i
regarding the insanitary condition of
Reservoir No. 4, and whereas the lat
ter board has referred all such recom
mendations to the governor, there
fore the governor be requested to
have such recommendations referred i
to the loan - fund commission. Mr. )
