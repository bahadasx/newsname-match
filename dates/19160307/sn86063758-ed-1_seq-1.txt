situation in South Carolina just now is
the subject < f a great deal of interest.;
There are rumors and threats Hying
thick and fast c* fire insurance companies
withdrawing from the State, in
view of the anti-compact bill passed by
the last legislature, and signed on
~ ??or Th,. hill I
Thursday uy uov. .wdnnuip. .... ?t
prohibits combinations for iho purpose
cr fixing rates. Tue insurance com- :
panies which have been in the Southeastern
confbination claim it will work
<i hardship upon them. and ineir aru-;
tude seems to be in the nature of an :
effort to boycott South Carolina. They ;
will no- succeed, however. There was j
some difficulty, for instance, about ?.
larcre risk in one ol the cities of this i
State on last Thursday, the day the !
governor signed the bill. T; was read-!
i!y taken by the representative of an- i
j- other insurance company?one of ttit-1
biggest in the United States?who hap- i
pened ro be in the State that day. Aj
large property holder in this same city j
in a fair wav to have his insurance'
*
* placed at half his former rate under
the new condition existing.
Of cour--. .it may take some little
time for the general shakeup caused
by the bill to be readjusted, but it is
hardly possible that an insurance combination
will be able to dictate term?
to a sovereign Srate upon which it
may do business in that State, or boy1
cott the property holders d rlie Sta+e j
as to fire insurance. In fact, it is no:
possible.
In a letter written to Senator Tillman
and Congressman Lever. Insurance
Commissioner McMaster says thaf
he believs a large numuer cu companies
"have entered into a conspiracy
to injure the people of the Siate by
disturbing in every way possible business
conditions, depriving agents of
means of livelihood and otherwise
r working great injury and loss to the 1
nermle " and he asks Senator Tillman
and Congressman Lever to seek a Federal
remedy for (his "most outrageous
condition." "The companies have
claimed that they lost money in South
.Carolina." he says, "and yet the law.
When it goes into effect, will permit
v each company to make its own rates by
its own experience."
It has been stated in the newspapers
that several companies have noti- ,

Newberry Countj Politics.
The interview published in the lasf
issue of The Herald and News with
Representative Xeal \Y. Workman of
Xewberry, in which Mr. Workman
states that he will probably be a candidate
for the State senate this summer,
has been noted with interest in j
political circles "here. <Mr. (Workman
made a fine record during his service
| in the house, where his ability was
k recognized by his fellow-members, and
r there is no doubt that he would represent
Newberry county worthily in 'h?
senate, as lie did in the house.
So far as is known here, the present
L senator from Newberry county has j
I'm cTpfinito nnh'ir> stinnintf'pmcit !
as to whether he would be a candidate
| or re-election. During a debate In
the State senate on the item in the appropviation
bill providing for the borrowing
of $."0,000 to be placed nt
disposal of the governor for prohibition
enforcement, one of the senators
?aid something about this being the
last time some ci~ the senators would
I represent their people, judging from
the way they were voting on certain
measures. In the course of a speech
following this remark Senator Johnsione
said:
"I don't know that I shall present
myself before the people of Newberry
county for the renewed privilege of sit
ting in this seat but tfM do I shall go
i before them with no broken promises
A ?none whatever. I made the people
^ of that county three distinct promises.
T promised them that I would give
them.the best service that I was ca
pable of. 1 have sought to do that.
1 promised them that I would bcnave
my self -that is, that 1 would keep such
company as would not make them
ashamed of their representative, l
have tried to i nihil that promise. And
I promised them that 1 would maV
some mistakes, and doubtless tave

TO THE FARMERS OF NEWBERRY
COUNTY:
Tile policy 01 the world today is

that are gripping each others
throat in the deadly combat of war.
but in our own threat country, we are
being shaken from center o ci cun.fcrcnce
with this thought, and the necessity
I or it. Not with a view 10 war
but for (lie purpose of maintaining
peace, contentment and prosperity.
Our economic conditions, certain^
in the South, whe e we rely so muc1'.
on . our one crop system?cotton?ibeing
weighed in Jie balance, if om
farmers are not forward-looking men
disastrous results will certainly fo1low.
We have sca cely emerged fro:r,
the liideoi > recollections and woo u'
effects of iix and sc. en cents cotton
which almost bankrun-^d the South

With preparations and activities
now pointing in no unmistakable way
to an early recurrence of financial depredation
which we so recently experienced.

century.

growing sufficient food crops to supply
his own needs and requirements,
and some surplus to seii his less fortunate

Then, too, raising all kinds 6 stock,
for which we are especially adapted on
account of climatic conditions, and our
ability to grow grasses and food stuffs
to maintain them nine months in the
year, and possibly, as a progressive
farmer told me the other day. 12
months in the year, which no other
section of this country can approximate.
In order to successfully accomplish
this, diversification and stock raising it
is necessary to reduce the cotton acreape
from LAST YEAR'S ACREAGE
which will insure a nimunerative

' c-!d Il'iti.. developed after the plants
ing season is over that the acreage lias
be en increased < ver last year to any j
great extent it would not be surprising
and indeed likely, that the price of
cot;011 will decline to such an extent
that the margin 011 [JORROWFID cotton
will be exhausted and the inability
ol' a great mar.y borrowers to put Jp ]
additional margin will necessitate
dumping this distress cotton on the
nraiket r?j?d which in -urn would read-j
ily } urther reduce its value, which
would no doub. be reflected in The
1 -rice of this year's crop.
If this i:> not a present and future
iicentive for reduction that can be
readily seen, I think somebody needs a
'?.iard:;;ii. 1 I sure lhat less fertilizers
will be used than usual, occasoned
p incipally by the inability of a
treat many to buy on account of the
great advance in prices, ami then, too,
on account of inferior grades obtain;blc
which is generally advanced as
sufficient argument that we can buc
make a small crop regardless of trie
acreage. This argument, to my mini,
is a delusion and" a snare in so far as i
(he price is concerned, as I really believe
that the powers that be (those

than the acreage usually justifies has
been made-, which will bp only arter
'he greater rortiou of our next crop
has been so'd and the most needy of
our farmers ha.e been relieved of their
j substance.
The world, however, has to be
( clothed, and many in the unfortunate
countries now waging 'his relentless
conflict are now in dire need of the
raiment the many looms of the world
are fashioning for them made of our
cotr04 upon which we at present have
a monopoly on account of our much
favored section by nature. Hence. I
do not believe we will make too much
cotton this year, if not in excess 0i
last year's crop to clothe the shivering
and naked of the earth.
I But what I am contending for is to
| do it at a little less acreage, which will
i insure us a living price and preserve
I what we already have in store.
