i Place Is Shown
i
New York, Mar. 7. Declaring the
National (iorma n-America 11 Alliance is
backing the McLemore ind Gore reso
lutions warning Americans off armed
liners, the New York World printed
a copyrighted article today exposing
the workings of uu alleged widespread
pro-German propaganda in the I'nited
states.
The World claimed Alplionso Koelble,
prominent New York ittorney was the
real chief of the alliance, and alleged
l. L. Marsalis. New York realty man,
was its leading lobbyist at Washing
ton. It asserted the alliance's prognm in
cluded warning Americans oft' armed
liners, controlling tile republican con
vention and defeating Woodrow Wilson
in his campaign for re election.
A copy of an alleged letter from ex-
'ongressman Bnrthnldt to Koelble sug
gesting a presiilenti.il boom for Chump
Clark was published in the article, to
gether with what purported to be a re
port from Alarsalis on, his lobbying in
behalf of the warning resolutions, nam
ing the legislators with whom he said
he hnd conferred. Among those named
were Seiutors Works, .lones. Chamber
lain nnd tlornh.
On January eleventh in a letter sign
(! "Locke," the World said Marsalis
wrote Koelble declaring he had inter
viewed Hepresentative Stephens of Ne
braska and Hen.itor Gore, suggesting
thev merge their bills preventing Amer
icans from traveling on armed belliger
ent ships, lie said they agreed and
that Marsalis added he would try to
have them include his own suggestions
in the merged measure.
The World chuged n secret circular
of the organization provided that no
Austrian, German or Jrish names ap
pear among the officers of the alliance.
Koelble 's denial that he is connected
with any such, organization or has anv
.oinection with any body maintaining
a loony nt Washington was also pub
lished bv the World. In this statement
Koelble was quoted as calling Mars.ilis
a " isrynn hug an.l a pacita-ist.

dler, whose body was found about mid
night in a rooming house on South

Vessel Wrecked On Coral Is
land, Survivors Had Primi
tive Life Six Months
.San Francisco, Mar. 7. Captain
Thomas Torgersen, of the Norwegian
schooner Frehni, was back in civiliza
tion today after having been cast away
for six months on a coral island, main
taining a brave front toward unfriend
ly natives and living on what he could
get from the sea by fishing.
He was accompanied by 12 members
of lira crew, who built rude shelters of
driftwood and grass, wore Robinson
Crusoe attire, and practically said fare
well to the world, never expecting res
cue. Their ship was driven ashore on
a reef near Molten island, 200 miles
south of Tahiti.
Almost six months to a day after the
wreck a tramp steamer chanced by,
saw the white men's distress signal
waving from a tall palm tree, and sent
ashore a small boat to investigate. Cap
tain Torgersen came to San Francisco
on the steamer Sonoma, with Adulph
Stub, one of the men cast away with
him.
Baker Is Evidently
Getting New Ideas
Cleveland, Ohio. Mar. 7. On the eve
of his departure for Washington, New
ton D. Baker, secretary of war-elect,
declared today lie favored the Swiss sys
tem of military training. He advocated
a number of transcontinental and coast
wise, rail'avs for strategical purposes.
'! belin.f." he faid, "in peace, and
in tlu proper .;;ifcrccment of pence laws
by forte if i.ecessary."
Baker believes the military railroads
should avoid passing through large
cities, being built to save as many miles
as possible in quickly transporting
ln go bodies of troops.
Congratulations poured in upon Baker
today. Many friends cnlleil to express
their fcntimenls personally. The new
c.ibii.et minister went home last night

Burned Before They Could
Be Released
THIRTY-FOUR, ALL NAKED
WERE WAITING FOR BATH
Roosted Alive In Red Hot Cells
Wiih Jailors Powerless
to Help Them
El Paso, Texas, Mar. 7. A match,
lighted by a morphine fiend, caused the
city jail fire which killed Hi nnd ter
ribly burned 10 prisoners, according to
the statement todav of Police Captain
L. L. H ill. He said':
"We know of 10 dead. Thirty four
naked men were in their cells waiting
to be bathed when a match, ignited by
a morphine fiend, set fire to disin
fectants used in the buth house."
Two additional deaths today brought
the total number of lives lost up to 10.
Twenty-five prisoners, mostly Mexi
cans, were caught in sheets of fhme
when the disinfectant exploded and
burned in the prison bath house. A
number of nude men, standing in line
awaiting their baths, were killed be
fore they could move to ilee.
Trapped in red hot steel cells, other
men cooked alive while their agonized
shrieks rang through the building.
Jailers niado vali.int attempts at rescue
but it was useless. The chemical fire
spread with great rapidity, radiating
so intense a heat that the turnkeys
were driven back with Beared faces ind
singed hair.
Within a short time after the flames
subsided many dead, some burned to a
crisp, were removed. There was no
wood construction nearby, but the gas
oline mixture made a short lived, fierce
fire.
El Paso, Texts., Mar. 7. Two more
city jail prisoners died today from
burns received when disinfectants used
in the prison bath house caught fire
last night. The total number of dead
and ying is now estimated at from P,
to eighteen. Three prisoners are not
expected to live through the day. Fifty
men were in the bath house when the
fire started.
Republican Senators
Surprised at Appointment
Washington, Mar. 7. "If President
Wilson selects a pacificist for secre
tary of war, why doesn't he appoint an
anarchist secretary of state!"
This is the way some republicans to
dny viewed the president's 'selection of
Newton D. Baker, of Cleveland, mem
ber of numerous peace organizations,
for the office of war secretary.
The republicans were surprised at the
appointment of a known pacificist, but
they evidently will not oppose his con
firniafion. The senators regard cabinet
officers merely as presidential advisers,
and hold that if the president wants a
i " peace-at almost-nny-pric.c " man, it is
his personal affair. It is the custom
not even to refer n cabinet appoint
hent to committee, but to confirm it im
I mediately.

Willamette Notes.
Last, night Eaton Hull was entered
by marnnders, and this morning when
the building was opened by Caretaker
( lark a sorry looking spectacle greeted
his eyes. All the doors had been re
moved from their hinges and the pins
that fastened them to the hinges were
first important results of the elcvilion
of Lord Hubert Cecil to a psition in the
I'ritish cabinet.
The operation of the new plan, t'.ie
minister said, will be left to the Irt
ish authorities in America who will
pass on the eligibility of shipments.
"There is no absolute gunriintee of
immunity under this plan," he said.
"The government retains the right to
seize goods if destined to the enemy,
but we will give shippers information
on which, from the business st Midpoint,
they can rely."
Lord Roberts said the government
was considering drawing up a new con
traband list. Great Britain's answer to
the American note on the blockade, he
added, probably will go forward With
in a few diya.

Willamette Valley Irrigated
Land Co. Wins Out Over
McGowans
The supreme court today reversed the
rulings of Judire Gallowav in the cir
cuit court in the case of il. S. McGown
and Lida I). McGown against the Wil
lamette Valley Irrigated Land comuiiy
in an opinion written by Justice iiur
nett. This suit involves a realty trans
action of some on-hard tracts near
Siayton. This suit involves a realty
transaction of some orchard tracts near
Stuyton. The plaintiffs allege in their
complaint that they contracted for a
certlin tract of land containing about
:!0 acres and were to pay :i,000 for it.
They claim the agents of the company
stated that the orchard tract was set to
young trees of which 00 per cent were
Rome Realities, 20- per cent Gnnos and
20 per cent Thompk'ins. The phintiffs
further allege that the facts were that
the varieties of apples on the land were
equal proportions of Spit.enhurgs and
Jonathans which later varieties were
not adipted to the soil and would not
be as valuable as the former varieties.
The defendants answered that there
were two similar tracts of land for the
plaintiffs to choose from anil tint they
selected the one with the Spitzcnbiirgs
and Jonathans on it. The decree of the
circuit court was for the defendants
and McGowns appealed. Attorneys

GERMANS HALTED
IN VERDUN ATTACK
BUT KEEP TRYING
Berlin Impatient Over Crown
Prince's Failure to Make
Progress
FRENCH NOT WORRYING
BUT FULL OF CONFIDENCE
Checked In One Place Army
Is Hurled at Another, Feel
ing for Weak Spot
London, Mir. 7. Using the tactics
which brought victory to Field Mar
shall Von Mackensen at Warsaw, the
Gcrmun crown prince's armies today
smashed at Verdun with their right nnd
left wings simultaneously.
The rigiit jaw of this monster "nut
cracker" of fire and steel idvanced in
nn impetuous rush to within seven
miles of Verdun, seizing Hill -0."i, ac
cording to the Paris war office's ad
mission. Simultaneously the left jaw shatter
ed French lines around l'resnes and, ac
cording to the German claim, captured
the v ill lgc. Paris failed to confirm the
report that Eresnes was taken. The
French statement mentioned only nr
tillerv duelling on the Woevrc plain
around Eresnes, in the Bras sectors,
and in the region of Hardniiniont. Ber
lin claimed further gains north of
Lnchalade in the Argonne forest, but
Paris asserted all Teuton attacks had
been hurled back with severe losses
near Haute Chevauche.
Hunting Weak Point.
London, Mar. 7. Halted again in
their attempt to breik tho French
ranks north of Verdun, the nrwics of
the German crown prince have shifted
their attack to the northwest defenses
of the city. They have captured Forges
a village eight miles northwest ami arc
battering the French trenches on Goose
Hill with big guns, according to the
latest P.uis advices todny. The French
are resisting with great strength, giv
ing the Germans shell for shell and
meeting them with the bayonet at
many points.
It is evident that the French are not
worried about Forges, an advanced vil
lage from which tho soldiers of the re
public rapidly retired under i terrific
cannonode, heading for the shelter of
Goose Hill, a mile south. Another slight
advance in that section would bring the
Teuton howitzers within range of the
main northwestern Verdun forts.
Expect Complete Collapse.
Crediting the Germans with success
in their first rush at Verdun, Pnris be
lieves the repeated checks of the past
few days ire a forerunner of the offen
sive's complete collapse. The Teu
tons suffered severely in their three
day fight to shatter the French center
at Doiiaumont, being hurled back in
confusion from the defenders' barbed
wire entanglements time and time
again, according to Paris.
Failing in this effort, the crown
prince sent his men agiinst the French
along tho west bank of the Meuse in
another attempt to find a weak spot.
They smashed first at one point of tiie
line and then nt. another, hammering
hard at each but the French stood
firm everywhere, it is declared. Tiie ns-1
mu u It h in that district arc continuing
furiously.
Tho crown prince's failure to make
more rapid progress is causing impati
ence nt Berlin. Evidently inspired ar
ticles iu newspapers urge the people to
be more patient. The Vossische Zeitung
said: "The battle at Verdun may
seem to be nuking slow progress to
people who like to dash through history
in an express train. German arms can
not alwavs win victories. But the deeds
already accomplished should earn im
plicit confidence in the magnificent
leadership of our armies."
Cost of Hill Is Great.
Paris, Mar. 7. Continuing their
smash against Verdun from the north
west, the Germans hive captured Hill
'Jii.'i near Rengeville, it was officially
admitted by the war office todav. The
Teutons charged and seized the hill
under cover of nn intense bombard
ment. Germans wiio occupied Forges storm
ed the hill, it was announced. The
French positions on Goose Kill are un
der severe shell fire. A general renew il
of extensive infantry operations is ex
pected. As the Germans charged out of
Forges and dashed toward Hill 'JO.") they
encountered a storm of shells from the
French guns, the war office declared.
Despite stigueriug losses they ad
vanced steadily up the slope, leaving l
trail of vlead and dying. As they nenred
the summit, struggling through a maze
of barbed wire, the French retreated
to Goose Hill, the village of llethin
court, the eastern part of the Corbeaux
forest, and Comieres wood.
Teuton irtillery immediately center
ed its fire on these positions. The of
ficial communique declared the French
still hold "the summit of Goose Hill."
This may mean the Gerans have al
ready occupied its slopes. Goose Hill

Tho MeLcmore resolution, at-

and says:
"Therefore be it resolved,
That the house of rcpresenta-
$ tives request the president of se
the -United States to warn all
Americans from traveling on

or in the future nt war, which

;s
Washington, March 7. The house of
representatives voted, this afternoon to
table the McLemore resolution warn
ing Americans off armed liners. Tots
made the administration victory com
plete in tooth branches of congress. The
vote was 276 to 113.
Great Crowd in Galleries.
Washington, Mar. 7. In a tumultous
session the house today went ou record
on tho issue of warning Americans ol'f
armed liners.
Tho first test resulted in a vote of
25(1 to KiO in tho administration's fa
vor. Tho house by that ballot refused
to permit amendment of McLemore 'a
warning measure.
A second roll call was immediately
begun on tho proposition of adopting
tho rule to bring McLcmoro's warning
before the house.
It was evident that the administra
tion would win again on a second early
roll call, and thut tho rule would be
adopted. 1
As the proceedings went on excite
ment increased. More than 10,000 spec
tators jammed every nvailablo foot of
xpneo in the galleries included in the
throng were many figures prominent m
world politics, as well ns representa
tives of the belligirent nations.
Some Warm Oratory.
The impassioned flights of oratory
stirred members as well as auditors tu
a frenzy. The applause increased in
volume. Women waved handkerchiefs.
Kumors that President W'itson would
not regard war as unwelcome, which
wero so hotly denied lust week, wera
revived and circulated through the cap
ital. Friends of the administration met
theso reports with heated denials and
denunciation.
On tho floor republicans and demo
crats got together on opposito sides, of
the momentous question.
On the second roll call tho adminis
tration won another victory. By a vote
of 271 to 13S the house adopted the rule
bringing tho resolution up for final
disposition.
Party affiliations were generally ef
faced on the first ballot, but the demo
crats voted ns a rule to cut off amend
ment of tho McLemore resolution.
Following a cabinet session, Presi
dent Wilson with Secretary Mc.Adoo
and Postmaster General Burleson re
mained in tho executive offices to learn
tho result of tho houso fight. As news
of tho proceedings was rushed to them
"piny by play" they appeared much
pleased.
The Tight Was Warm.
Washington, Mar. 7. The fight on
McLemore's resolution warning Amer
ican's off armed liners stnrted in the
houso at 11:10 o'clock this mnrninsr
when Hepresentative Poll called up for
consideration the rule submitting Mc
Lemore's mensure to the house.
After the house passed the rule for
a 90 minute debate, liepresntativ Pout
opened for the administration, unemo
tionally reciting President Wilson 's re
quest for a "show down," and tho
steps lending to it.
"It Is Raid," declared Tou, "that
tho Mcl.emnro resolution does not raise
the desire issue. Its express terms say,
that if Americans travel on armed lin
ers they do so at their own risk. Is
there a human being who would stand
for such a doctrine? Wo would brins
upon ourselves the contempt of all civil
ized men.
"It hns been unjustly charged that
the pif s'dcut wants war. All tho imps
of hell never devised a more infamous
lie."
