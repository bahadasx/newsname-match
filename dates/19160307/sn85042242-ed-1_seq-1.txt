Berlin Announces That Commerce
Raider Is Safe in German
Harbor.
MANY BRITISH
PRISONERS ON BOARD
Craft Also Laid Out Mines to
Which Battleships Fell
I Victims.
iBerlin, March 6.—Announcement
was made here Sunday that Die Ger­
man cruiser Moewe arrived today in
a German port. She had on board a
large number of British prisoners,
and ,000,000 marks in gold bars.
The statement follows:
"The naval general staff states
I hat H. M. S. Moewe, commander
Captain Bin-grave Count, von Dohna
Schildien, after a successful cruise
lasting several months, arriving today
at some home port with four British
officers, twenty-nine British marines
and saiiors, 1M5 men of crews of
enemy steamers, among them 103
Indians, as prisoners, and l,000,0(ki
marks in gold bars.
"The vessel captured the following
enemy steamers, the greater part of
which were sunk and a small part of
which were sent as prizes to neutral
ports
"The 'British steamers Corbridge,
3.GS7 tons Author, H.-tfltf tons Trader
•3,fi08 Ions Ariadne, 3,035 tons 'Drom­
on hy, 3,027 tons, Farringford, 3,14t!
tons Clan, M'acTavish, fi 81G tons
Appam, 7,731 tons Westburn, 3,300
tons Horace, 3,33f tons Flamenco,
4/629 tons Saxon Prince, S.471 tons.
"The British sailing vessel Edin
burgh, 1,473 tons.
"The French steamer 'Maroni, 3,109
tons.
"The Belgian steamer Luxembourg,
4,3'22 tons.
"At. several points on enemy coasts
the Moewe also laid ow fuTheK to
which, among others, the battleship
King Edward til. fell victims."
The Moewe's capture of two of the
fifteen vessels listed by the German
admiralty has not been reported pre
viotisly. They are the Saxon Prince
and the Maroni, both of which were
engaged in the Trans-Atlantic service.
The Saxon Prince, 3,471 tons gross,
@52 feet long and owned by the Prince
line of Newcastle, England, was built
in Sunderland in 1899. She was last
rep6rted on sailing from Norfork,
iFebruary 12, for Manchester.
The Maroni sailed on February 19
from Bordeaux for New York. She
was built at Port de Bouc in 1909,
owned by the Compagnie iGenerale
Trans-Atlantique of Havre, and was
312. feet long, of 3,109 tons gross.
The Moewe, previously made fa­
mous by her exploits, has performed
one of the most spectacular feats of
the war on the seas by reaching a
home port in safety. The great Ger­
man naval port of iWilhelmshaven is
on the North sea, which is patrolled
with ceaseless vigilance by British
warships. It is through these waters,
which have been blocked off in dis­
tricts for patrol by the different Brit­
ish unites, that the IMoewe must have
threaded her way to home and safe­
ty.
At least part of the gold captured
by the Moewe was taken from the
'Appam, which put in at Newport
News several weeks ago under com­
mand of Lieutenant Berg with a
German prize crew.
Announcement was made in London
on January 10 that the British battle­
ship King Edward VU. had been
blown up by a mine. The place at
which the disaster occurred was not
revealed by the (British admiralty. It
was said no lives were lost and only
two men were injured.
The Moewe first became famous
when the Appam reached Newport
News with a story which astonished
the world. It was learned that the
commerce raider had captured and
.sunk seven 'British vessels in the
main line of* traffic between South
Africa and Europe, in addition to
seizing the Appam, which had been
almost given up for lost.
The next heard of the German raid­
er was on the arrival at Canary
Islands late last month of the West
burn in charge of a German prize
crew. It was then made known that
the Moewe had sunk five more steam­
ships off the coast of £tazil.
The Saxon Prince and Maroni
probably captured by the Moewe on
her way back to Germany, as their
sailing dates show they were both on
the high seas toward the end of
February.
The identy of the Moewe has not
been established here definitely.' Pris­
oners from captured ships which were
transferred' to the Westburn said on
their arrival at the Canary Islands
that the IMoewe's guns were smaller
than seven inches. According to one
report she -was formerly a tramp
steamship, one of several which had
•been fitted out with guns as com­
merce raiders. The last previous re­
port of the Moewe was that she part­
ed company with the 'Westburn on
February 9.

rander, belongs to the Schlodien or

the most heated campaigns in the
history of Hoosier politics closed to­
night and the voters tomorrow will
express their preference in the first
state-wide presidential primaries to
be held in Indiana, when the candi­
dates for president will be voted upon.
El Paso, March 6.—Nine dead, elev­
en probably fatally burned and a
score or more left seriously injured
was the toll of an explosion and fire
late today at the city jail. The name
of one American is included in the
list of dead and twelve are numbered
among those seriously burned. Sur­
geons said tonight the death list
would probably reach twenty, as
many of the injured would not live
more than a few hours.
Charles Phelps, an American motor
man, was shot and seriously wounded
while running his car in Juarez to­
night by a man wearing the uniform
of a Mexican officer. The shooting,
according to the Mexican consul here,
followed a report in Juarez that 200
Mexicans had been jailed atid burn­
ed to death here.
H. M. Cross, an American who died
of injuries, was named as the man

MATTER UP TO
LIBRARY BOARD
Its Appointment Next Step in the
Move to Get New
Institution.
Carnegie's offer to build a $'25,000
library in Bismarck was made pos­
sible of acceptance by the commis­
sion last evening agreeing to appro­
priate $2,500 for maintenance of the
institution. Notification of (his ac­
tion will be sent the Carnegie Li­
brary commission and then the city
will be in line to avail itself of the
offer.
The final steps, however, must be
taken by the library board, which
probably will be appointed soon by
ihe school board. Action of the com
mission in notifying the Carnegie Li
brary foundation seems to indicate
that the Carnegie offer will be accept
ed when Ihe regular library board is
formed.
This was the most important' Inisi
ness before the commission last eve
ning. Application for a ferry fran
cliise from Waller (iossard was rc
l'erred to a committee. Tlie mallei
of building a storm sewer on Broad
way, east of Ninth street, wasdjs

to confer with the railway officials.
SEVEN KOBE SHIPS
TO HAKE
Washington, March 6.—Three
dreadnoughts and four battle cruisers
added to the American fleet, built and
authorized, would make it the equal
in fighting strength lo Ihe present
German fleet, Admiral Fletcher, com
mander of the Atlantic ileet, declared
today before the house naval commit
tee.
While Germany has seven battle
cruisers and the United States none
the admiral said the 35-knot crafts
proposed by the navy department
would be so much superior to any
thing now afloat that four of them
possibly three, would more than offset
the seven German boats.
With the present fleet of 42 battle­
ships of all types, three additional
dreadnoughts and seven battle cruis
ers, the admiral thought "he could
reasonably make a dood defense, al­
though not an absolute one," of both
coasts against any combination of
two enemy powers that did not in­
clude Great Britain.
NEW YORK CITY
IS SNOWBOUND
New York, March 6.—Steamship
movements and street traffic here
was seriously interrupted by a snow
storm. The traffic reported that four
inches had fallen and that this would
be increased to six inches by tomor­
row morning. A call was issued by
the city tonight for 40,000 men to
clear the snow from the streets.
flames swept' the hospital rendering
it untenable and useless for the press
of emergency work that followed.
On fire from head to foot, the vie
tims dashed into the streets and al­
leys surrounding the prison. Several
maddened by the paid outdistanced
all pursuers and disappeared. Only
one of these had been found several
hours after the disaster*
A number of them were blinded.
Nine persons were burned to death
and probably 40 seriously injured,
many fatally, in afire today at the
city hath-house. The blaze started by
a flash of flames from a large tub of
gasoline and kerosene solutions, used
to destroy germ carrying lice.
In their first reports, officials attrib­
uted the origin to the deliberate ac
tions of one of the .prisoners in throw7
ing a lighter match in one of these
containers.
More than a score of prisoners who
were thoroughly saturated with the
solution were enveloped in its flames.
Jail attendants imemdiately opened
exits, allowing the prisoners in the
bathrooms to escape, although seri­
ously burned.
'Surrounding the bath quarters are
rows of cells, mostly filled with pris­
oners. Those adjacent to that were
caught in the flames. Release from
the cells was slow and dangerous and
it' was in these that most of the fatali­
ties occurred.

AJI KILLED
Several Children lain as They
Ijay* in 'ifJieir Beds
OTHERS SHOT OR
SLASHED WITH RAZOR
Lawton, Okla., March 0.—Seven
members of the family of Dan Okane,
at farmer, wore found murdered
in their home twelve miles southwest
of Lawton today. Okane himself lay
beside the body of his father, prob­
ably fatally shot.
The murderer had used a razor, a
hammer and a small calibre rifle.
Those killed were:
Okane's wife, an infant, four child­
ren, ranging from I to 10 years of age,
and Okane's father, who lived with
the family.
The children were found in bed.
Their throats had been slashed and
their heads crushed. Mrs. Okane
and the baby were shot to death. The
rifle also had been used to slay the
father.
Okane, beside his father, lay with
a bullet in his head. The rifle, a
razor and hammer were found nearby.
Okane formerly was employed by
the government to care for the cattle
of prisoners of war.
Testimony tending to show that
Daniel killed seven members of his
family and then took his own life was
introduced before a coroner's jury,
which late today held an inquest at
the Okane home, near here, where
the people found the bodies of the
murdered
persons.
Okane died in a hospital in this
city this evening. Witnesses testified
that Okane frequently had quarreled
with his aged father, James Okane.
and gave their belief that the estrang­
ed relations existing between the son
and father caused Daniel Okane to
become insane.
Orpet Is
Indicted
Chicaeo. March 6.—'Will H. Orpet,
University of Wisconsin student, was
indicted by a
Lake
county grand jury
today on a charge of murdering his
former sweetheart, Marian Lambert.
The case probably will be called
for trial next week, but a continuance
on request of the defense is expect­
ed.
The grand jury heard 25 witnesses,
for the most part the same persons
who testified at the coroner's inquest.
They included E. C. Orpet, father of
the defendant Frank Lambers, father
of the girl, and Joseph B. Davis and
Verne Jackson, school friend of hers.
It is charged that the tragedy was
the culmination of a liason, that it
was precipitated by Orpet's transfer­
ring his affections to another woman,
and that he provided a violent poison,
which the £irl swallowed.

After having vigorously shelled the
regions between Bethincourt and fhe

fantry attack captured the village of
Forges, about nine miles northwest
of Verdun. Not satisfied with the
gains won, they several times essay­
ed to debouch from the village again,
but the French in a counter attack
forced them back to the village and
held them I hero.

who opposed them. Two officers and
280 men were taken prisoneres, and
two guns and a quantity of ammuni
tion were captured.
Owing, lo the heavy rains and ava
lanches, fighting has almost ceased
on the lAustro-italian front.
iBerlin reports that, in the Zeppelin
raids over England, Sunday night, the
Hull naval depot was bombarded with
effect. All Ihe German air craft re­
turned safely.
The three German air raiders caus­
ed 47 casualties Sunday night, accord­
ing to reports received up to mid
night tonight.
Reports from the parts of the raid­
ed territory speaks of the Zeppelins
remaining stationary at lower alti­
tudes. All three of them seemed to
have lost their bearings on account of
ihe weather conditions. The German
official report says that all the raid­
ers returned safely.
Sunday's raids showed two things
to Ihe British public—that snow­
storms are no hindrance to the Ger­
man aircraft, and second, that the
public warnings which are given to
most of the districts visited do not
lead to panic but probably lessen the
casualties.

Los Angeles, .March 6.—Reports

LAUDS JUSTICE HUGHES
Chicago, March 6.—Vice-president
Marshal in an address tonight before
the Chicago Bar association, paid tri­

Hughes for his refusal to permit his
name to be considered for the repub­
lican presidential nomination.
"How splendid a tribute to that
great body, the supreme court, it is
that Mr. Justice Hughes has promptly
refused to permit his name to be
used as a candidate for president of
the United States," said the vice
president.
"This refusal makes him as great
an American as though he were presi­
dent, pulled hither and thither by the
contending hopes and fears of ambi­
tious politicians."
The vice president staunchly up­
held President Wilson in his diplo­
matic negotiations with nations at
war.
"As the present writes of Abraham
Lincoln, the future will write of
Woodrow Wilson."
Naval Battle

London, March fi.—Certain some­
what vague, but persistent, rumors
which have been circulated here for

created a state of expectancy among
Londoners. This expectancy has
been heightened by dispatches re­
ceived from Scandinavia today, pre­
dicting that a battle between British
and Russian and German warships is
not far distant.
Russian torpedo boats are reported
to have been seized near the Island
of Borland. Sweden, in the Baltic sea,
and a half dozen German submarines
have been observed off Oxelsund, on
the Baltic to the south of Stockholm.

Representative Mann of Illinois, re­

Lenroot of Wisconsin, republican
member of the rules committee, gave
notice that they would oppose tomor­
row the rule under which it is pro­
posed to table the McLemore warning
resolution, alter ninety minutes of
debate on the rule and four hours'
discussion of the resolution itself.
On the other hand, Chairman Flood
of the foreign affairs committee, who
has been understood personally to
favor warning resolution, can ap­
peal to all patriotic congressmen to
stand by the president.
Realizing the iask ahead of them,
Ihe administration whips sent out

time for fhe vote totoOrfw. 'The
president's supporters believe that a

well as republicans, will stand to­
gether to put through the rule and
kill the McLemore resolution. Therie
will be formidable opposition both in
and out of the party, however, and
the influence of William .Jennings
Bryan is being taken into account as
a big factor to be dealt with.
Fourteen representatives and two
senators met at lunch today with Mr.

discussed affairs generally. What
transpired there remained a secret.

Speakers on both sides of the warn­

to determine which sentiment was
the stronger. When Mr. Mann vigor­
ously protested that the question
never should have been thrown into
the house, and criticising Americans
for taking passage on armed ships,
expressed the hopes that such an act
would never draw the country into
war, he was cheered heartily by the
whole house.
To Determine Wext Move.
With the appendices to Germany's
declaration of the new submarine
campaign against armed merchant
ships of her enemy before them, the
administration is preparing to deter­
mine the next move of the United
States in the negotiations with the
Central European powers.
According to present plans, diplo­
matic negotiations on the subject are
to follow a settlement of the controv­
ersy in congress.

Because of the necessity of trans*
lating some of the documents append­
ed to the German declarations, Secre­

perusal tomorrow, probably. Col. E.
