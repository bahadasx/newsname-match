ports Successes:.
London, March 6. The Germans
around Verdun are being hard held
to the positions they occupy, by the
French. The fighting throughout
the region is still vigorous, but con
sists mainly of artillery duels.
Douaumont is the storm center,
and here and in the wood to tho cast
of Vacherauvilie, on the east bank of
tho Meuse, have occurred the only
infantry attacks. On both these
sectors the Germans were reputed.
The German attack at Douaumont ex
tended from the Haudremont wood
to Fort Dpunmont, but according to
Paris, it was stopped by the curtain
of fire and the rifles of the French in
fantry, and ended with tho French
holding all their positions.
Paris reports that the Wocvre re
gion about Fresnes, the bombard
ment is a powerful one, but adds
that the French guns are answering,
those of the Germans here, and alone

had previously taken from the

jlin, "to avoid unnecessary losses"1
The Russians and Germans in
northwest Russia have been fighti'iiR
furiously near Ilioukst for possession
of the craters of fourteen mines ex
ploded by the Russians.
Petrograd reports that six of the
craters were captured by tho Russians
and that the Germans are surroundetL
in a partly demolished blockhouse,
having suffered severe losses.
Unofficial dispatches from Buchar
est report extensive Russian troop
movements in Bessarabia. There
has been another clash between Bul
garian soldiers and Greok frontier
guards in the neighborhood of
Macikovo, on the Greco-Serbian
frontier.
The German commerce raider
Moewe, the exploits of which have
been sensational, has run the ontentc
allies' blockade and entered x Ger

Wilhelmshaven. Aboard the raider
were 199 prisoners from vessel sJm

GERMANS RESOURCEFUL.
Floating mines, equipped with per
iscopes, is said to be the latest deviw
now being used by tho Germans ixt
bringing about the destruction oCck
emy ships.
According to masters of British
vessels the placing of a periscope .t
a mine was devised for the express
purpose of inducing some of the slime-
of the allied nations to ram it, which
would have resulted in tho blowinc
up of the ship and possibly the foss
of life. It is understood that a num
ber of tho periscoped mines have
been cast adrift around Britain aiu
tho fleet of patrol boats aro engaged
in removing them from the track u
