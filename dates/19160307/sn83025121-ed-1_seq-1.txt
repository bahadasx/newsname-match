but on the other hand, the French have
surreRiifully held- them back in spite
of heavy artillery bombardment and

Tiie French artillery is more than
holding its own in this battle. One
of the big Oermaa munition posts in
the Argonne has been exploded by the
fire of French six-inch guns, which are
lAiidering roost effective service all
along the battered lines.
Berlin reports that the Germans on

The landing poiat for the the aw" V

be meeting with but small resistance ;
from the Turkish army. The t-oor ar
being transported from Uatum, where . '' s '
they have been held la readiness for ,' '
several month. ' t
The fact that they were not ol. " -in
the earlier stage of the Armenian, '
campaign lead to the belief that the
Grand Duk ha under hi command a J
fresh army to push an. aggressive earn- ,'
jiaign through Armenia, drivfng west
ward towa.d Constantinople, or to th
southwest to join the British in Mesop
otamia, or for an attack ou Bagdad
from the north.
If he decide upon the latter courie , ;
he is expected to push forward at
once against Diarbekor, 140 mile
southwest of Erxerum.
Fleet I at Work ,
The Russians have occupied Wit de '
or Widje, and pressed forward ten or
twelve miles westward. The fleet bas '
destroyed several shore batteries and ' '
keepinK well in advance of the land 5 :
ton e, and by destroying bridge over
several stream in the path of retreat-'
ng Tu-ks has rendered their retTeat
more difficult. The fleet haa been
working so close to the shore that the
warships have been reached by rifle ,
fire from the Turkish troips.
The rapid Russian offensive beyond
Krzerom, it is believed here, make it
probable that th retreat of th Tur
kish corps operating along th Black
Sea coast and Of those troops which
were active in the Mush district before
the Russian occupation will be entire
ly cut off and that the mala Turkish
Hrniie, will be surrounded!.
Capital In Turmoil . "
Thst the people of Constantinople '
fear this increasingly, is shown by h ,
repeated report of riot against the '
Young Turk party and th continuance
of the war ia the Ottoman capital.
News from Coustautlttopla represents
the situation there as most critical sine
the news of the fall of Erxerum haa
leaked out.
The always latent dissatisfaction of
the people with their Young Turk ruler
is now assuming hourly mora threaten
ing proportion, both In the capital and
the provinces, especially ia flmyraa,
where the populace is In almost oieu
revolt.
The leader of dissafection are O
man Pasha, Abbdi Pasha and Huwat
Pasha. Startling developments, it is
asserted, may be coufldeutly expected
very shortly.
Other reports from the eApital say
that a bund of Turkish women broke
into the railway yard wheu troop
trains were leaving, protesting against '
sending the men to death. They pros
trute I themselves on the rail in front
of the engine and would not allow
the tram to be moved. Later ia the
night the trooi were secretly movd.
The people of Constantinople had
been led to believe that a German vie.
tory had been won at Ve?dun and riot
c I when they learned the advance was
. lucked. The riot were suppressed by
German troop.
