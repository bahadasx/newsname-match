Even should it develop that Baker
was as fixed in his Ideas on arma

made on him. The senate takes the
stand that a cabinet officer is simply
an adviser of the president, and that
if the latter wants a pacifist, it is
his personal affair.
The senate custom Is not even to
refer a cabinet appointment, to a

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, March 7.—The
house today in tumultous session
went on record In the armed mer
chantmen issue with the president.
The first test vote in the house on
the armed merchantmen question re
sulted 2G6 to 160- in favor of the ad
ministration. By this vote the house
refused to permit amendment of the
McLemore warning resolution.
Immediately upon completing the
vote, the house began a second roll
call on adopting the rule to bring up
the McLemore resolution.
The first test vote began Just be
fore one o'clock on the question of
amending the McLemore resolution
so it would permit an unequivocal ex
pression on the warning of Americans
off armed ships.
The roll call was the first of three
in a tempestous day. Historic scenes
of the Spanish-American war were re
called. Over 2,000 spectators, crammed
and jammed In a solid mass In the
galleries, viewed the struggle. Among
them were prominent figures in world
politics, including representatives of
the belligerent nations.
Flights of impassioned oratory
stirred the house and spectators to a
frenzy of excitement. Republicans
and democrats alike joined in the
plea to "sustain the president."
Republicans and democrats alike
also voiced their opposition to the ad
ministration's armed merchantmen
policy.
The rumors that the president
would not view war as unwelcome,
were revived. They were denounced
as ridiculous. The republican leader,
Mann, pleaded for a straight out vote
on a warning resolution by amending
the McLemore document.
Waves of applause swept the house
as the wordy war reached Its climax.

Two Victories.
WASHINGTON, March 7.—Presi
dent Wilson won two crushing pre
liminary victories in the house today
in his controversy with congress over
the armed merchantmen question.
The preliminary test votes left little
doubt that the house late this after
noon will completely oomply with the
president's demand to kill the resolu
tion of Representative McLemore to
warn Americans off armed ships.
On the first record roll call the
house sustained the administration
266 to 160. This vote shut off all
amendments to the McLemore docu
ment. It prevented the house from
voting on a simple substitute resolu-'
tlon presenting the merits of the
warning question and put the house
on record against considering the
vital Issue at this time.
On the second vote the administra
tion was again sustained, 271 to 138,
to adopt the rule bringing the McLem
ore resolution up for a final vote later
on a motion to table it.
These roll calls taken amid stirring
dramatic scenes, followed an oratori
cal battle which thrilled members and
spectators. They were followed by
four hours debate, leading to the final
roll call.
The final vote was scheduled to be
gin about six o'clock. This was to be

lution, with all other Issues swept
