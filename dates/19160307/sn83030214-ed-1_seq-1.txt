I here's a generous foretaste of Spring for you in
The Graphic Picture Section next Sunday. Three big
pages of flower gardens in bloom?some of the most
charming little gardens in America?and a fourth page
thnt takes you around in the Gardens of Nippon.
You who love gardens will be fascinated by these
? harming effect!?and perhaps you'll be surprised to
find so many of them well within your own means. So
get The Graphic Picture Section Sunday. The snow
won't make Spring seem so far away if you tell your
newsdealer that he must deliver your Sunday Tribune.
