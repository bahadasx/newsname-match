Girl Bride Who Killed Betrayer to Get
Immunity on Account of Juvenility
FOIIT WOI1TK, Texas, March 6. KuthCrine Vunee Harrison, the
1 ,'i-year-old bride who shot and killed W. I Warren because, us she said,
he had attacked her before her marriage last'C'hristmus, will probably not
be indicted. The Texas law makes' no provision for prosecution of a per
son under eighteen for murder. An effort is being made by relatives of
Warren to pre Mrs. .Harrison 'In nineteen, but it Is npt regarded with
toleration by the authorities of the community
Miss Lois Onion, the youthful bride's close friend, who" made the State
ment to the police which led to Mrs. Harrison's confession, has disap
peared. The young husband stands staunchly by tha girl, saying that he
it only sorry her revenge was not attained by his hands.
The confessed slayer of Warren has been smilingly self-confident ever
since the death of Warren, and seems Incapable of understanding why she
should be held to account. Her only unhappy moments seemed to be those
when she had to tell to the police and her mother, Mrs. Itessie Tackelt,
thi story of the attack of Warren on her and her mental suffering when
tho older man insisted on maintaining friendly relations with her and her
husband, who did not know of Warren's guilt until the shooting.
