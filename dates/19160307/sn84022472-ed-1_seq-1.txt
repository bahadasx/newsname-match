COUNCIL GIVES
LIGHTING FIRM
BIG MONOPOLY
Machine Aldermen Override
Protests of Harrigan
Against It.
CITY PICKS LEMON
DESPITE WARNINGS
Stagg, Who Engineered
, Deal- Couldn't Tell De
tails of Contract.
"Under the contract with the
United Illuminating Co., which the
common council ' ratified last might,
the city of Bridgeport will not only
be obliged to pay the same rate , as
a private individual biitt the illumin
ating company is also v given a mon
opoly on street lighting in this city,"
declared Alderman Daniel P. Harri
gan today.
On the recommendation of the
lamps committee, the common coun
cil last night it was voted to give the
Illuminating . Co. a contract for 500
tungsten lights for three years to
supplant the gas lamps now In use
about the , city. Alderman Harri
gan's . contention is that under this
contract the city not only gets - less
right but pays more for it.
In opposing the letting of the con
tract last night ' and asking ithat the
contract Ibe reconsidered, Alderman
Harrigan asked Alderman Stagg,
chairman of the lamps committee-,
some embarrassing questions, which
he did not answer. . The contract
with the Illuminating Co. was made
under the direction of Alderman
Stagg. - His committee had several
secret sessions in the .city clerk's of
fice In "the city hall at which Charles
AJ ' Paul,- Bridgeport ' manager , of the
lighting company, , was present. Rep-'
resentatives of the American Street
Lighting Co., the only other bidder
for the contract, were barred.
Alderman jHarrigan last night asked
Alderman Stagg what the voltage, and
the amperage " of each light, . which
the Illuminating Co. proposed to fur
nish, would be. Alderman Stagg
would not answer. ' He knew the
candle power would be 80.
"I'll answer the other -questions for
you,", said Alderman Harrigan. "The
voltage, will be 17 and the amperage
4. To have a light that will equal!
in brilliancy the present 60 candle
power gas lamps- we should have
tungsten lights of at least 100 candle
power. The city loses -either way,
in light and In the cost.
"Multiply the voltage by the amp-
erage and - you get 6 8 watts, -. which
each light 'burns.. There are 4,200
burning hours each year. Multiply
this . again (by the wattage per night
arid you get 2,856, Ithe Vatta-Se for the
ear. , Multiply this by seven cents.
the price per killowat hour and you
get $19.99. The price the commit
tee got from the Illuminating Co. was
$20. You see the company shaded
the cent difference In its own favor.
" "Now I have reliable information
that electricity for lighting purposes
can be produced, for about one and
one-half cent a kilowatt or at a cost
of about $4.27 per lamp per year. ' I
am willing this contract should have
been made on a sort of 50 50 basis
but I am opposed to this contract
which proposes to charge the cflty the
same rate as a private individual. I
know that manufacturers get current
for; less than seven . cents . and the
city is charged a trifle more than sev
en cents.
"I believe five cents per kilowatt
would be a fair price considering the
amount of business involved in the
contract and the time it is to run. At
five cents the cost per light would be
about $14.58 per year, a total cost
to the city of. $7,140 for the number
of lights it is proposed to furnish.
The cost now is $9,996." "
Alderman Stagg responded that the
contract had -been made after bids
had been received by the board of
contract and supply and the United
Illuminating Co. had been found the
lowest bidder. . Alderman Harrigan
replied that he did not think the
"board of contract and supply had tak
en pains to get good bids. Alderman
Caldwell said the committee had done
its best and there was no intention
to- make play to the grand stand In
letting the contract.
"I don't think the committee has
j done its best," retorted Alderman
j Harrigan. "I have presented figures
l to show-, you that you simply obtained
the same raite which a private in
dividual pays. Anyone could go out
and make a contract like that. I will
ask that this contract be reconsider
ed." Alderman Harrigan's motion to re
consider the lighting contract was
seconded by Alderman Corr but was
voted down by the Republican mem
bers of the iboard. The contract, was
then ratified despite the opposition
from the Democratic members.

OLD FiHEPLHOE SPREAD
Bundle of Rags Stuffed In Ancient Chimney Com
municates Blaze to Woodwork and Causes
Great Damage -One Fireman in Hospital, As
sistant Chief Hurt and Others Bruised By Fall
ing Stack.
The use of a fireplace that was
abandoned years ago, caused a blaze
that gutted the Golden Inn club, on
Fairfield avenue near Ash Oreek this
morning.
A bundle of rags that . had been
placed in an old fashioned chimney was
ignited by flames from a burning log
and shortly before noon a fire broke
out that greatly damaged the struc
ture. ..
The damage is estimated at between
$3,000 and $4,000. The loss in furniture
is about $2,500. The total loss is ex
pected to be in the . neighborhood or
$7,000.
During the fire the lives of four nre-
men and Assistant cmer veorge
Beardslee were placed in Jeopardy
when the large chimney running
through the center of the building fell
with a crash. ' More than a ton of
brick and plaster went crashing
through the second floor of the build
ing. , Some of the bricks struck Fire
man John A. Smith of Truck No. 1 on
the head and he- was taken to St. Vin
cent's hospital in Fire Chief Daniel E.
Johnson's automobile. He is not seri
ously injured. One of ' the failing
bricks landed on the right hand of
Ladderman George D. Eagan of Truck
L He received theatment from Fire
man Bowen of No. 3 Engine company,
and remained at the scene of. the fire.
When the mass of debris struck on
the first floor of the Inn a large lump
of brick and mortar njarrowly missed,
striking Assistant Fire Chief George
Beardslee., As it was he was struck
With several of the " falling missiles.
He was not seriously hurt.
Frederick Schramm of Black Rock,
an Iceman, who stables his horses in
the barn to the rear of the Inn, says
he was instructed by Manager Goul-
den to make "a fire in the dining
room. He went out and cut a log
of green oak and placed it on the
hearthstone at 9 o'clock. He then
left the Ibuilding. Manager Goulden
left the place about 8 o'clock and
came to the city tto do some shop
ping A pile of rags were later found
smouldering in the upper part of the
old fashioned chimney. The cause
of their presence in the chimney
canmot.be ascertained. It is the opin
ion of Assistant -Chief . Beardslee and
Fire Chief Daniel . E. ' Johnson, that
the rags were the cause of Ithe build
ing being- consumed. In the old
brick chimney were many crevices
where the mortar had disintegrated
and it is the belief of Chief Beardslee
that the flames from the burning log
crept through' the crevices and ignit
ed the rags in' the chimney.
No one was in the house when the
fire was discovered. Smoke was first '

building- by Chris Schick, proprietor
of the Ash Creek Inn. Schick tele
phoned an alarm to. Chemical Co. No.
2, Ibut before the firemen arrived at
the scene an alarm of fire was rung in
from box No. 2517 at Fairfield avenue
and Morehouse street, almost half a
mile from the scene of the blaze.
Engine companies 1 and 3, Hook
& Ladder Co. (No. 1 and Chemical
Engine company No. 1 responded to
the alarm from box No. 2 517t By
the time the firemen arrived the
building was a mass of flames. The
blaze had broken through the roof
of the building and scorched the
limbs of "many of the giant oak trees
surrounding the inn.
The flames also rworked their way1
downward through the floor of tfce
dining room. The lives of many fire
men were jeopardized on entering the
dining room, which was filled with
smoke and fallen timbers. The entire
flooring in the center of this room
had been eaten away by the flames.
There are 15 rooms in the old
homestead and scarcely a room es
caped a scorching from the flame. A
piano, said to be valued at $800, was
ruined. Paintings that adorned the
walls of the sitting room were also
fiestroyed. The plaster in all the
rooms on the first and. second floors
were ripped down by pikes in the
hands of the firemen. The entire
flooring of the second story will have
to be rebuilt. The fire was chiefly
centered about the dining room and
music room on the west, side of the
inn. - -
While Assistant Chief Beardslee
was directing the firemen in the low
er part of the house Fire Chief Dan
iel E. Johnson led other firemen in
their effort to quench the flames in
the1 attic and which had broken
through the roof of the building.
The Golden Inn club property is
owned by Rev. L A. Woitys of 41
Franklin street, Nashua, N. H. He
formerly was ' pastor of St. George's
church on Park avenue. The build
ing was known as the "old Downes
homestead", and is of the Colonial
type of architecture. Norman Goul
den conducts the club. .
The house ia said to have been
erected back in Colonial days. It was
the property of Charles S. Cole as far
back as SO years ago. He sold the
estate to the Downes family and they
later sold it to a man named Moran,
a wealthy New Yorker. Moran is re
recorded as having sold the estate to
the present owner Rev. L A. Woitys.
It is as yet unknown whether or not
the place was insured. ,
The club recently received great

TRIAL M'AY-10
NNEWHAVEN
Three Managers of Packing
Houses Must Answer To
Federal Courts in Hearing
That May Be Long.
New Haven, March 7.- The trial of
three managers of branch houses of
Western beef packers on charges of
violations of the federal meat inspec
tion law, was set for May 10 by Judge
E. S. Thomas, in the United States dis
trict court today. Pleas of not guilty
were entered through counsel by the
defendarV' who jointly with' their com
panies ai'e J. H. Coughlin, manager
for the Cudahy Packing Co. at Bridge
port; George D. Roberts, manager for
Morrris & Co. at Bridgeport, and. John
A. Crowe, manager for the Cudahy
Co. in New Haven.
Samuel Campner, of this city, for
the companies and the individual de
fendants, asked that a date be set in
May and United States District At
torney Spellacy was agreeable.
There are seventeen counts against
each of the Bridgeport defendants
and two against Mr. Crowe and Mr.
Spellacy said he would go to trial on
the Crowe " complaint first, following
with those against Roberts and
Coughlin, in order.
In brief, the allegations are that the
meat inspection law has been violated.
There is a difference of opinion as to
the meaning of the law between the
department of agriculture and the le
gal departments of the packing con
cerns. The charges , relate to ship
ment of meats from a house where
"processing" is done, through inter
state commerce without re-inspection.

Judge John J. Walsh Sus

sel for Local Man
DEPRIVES PROPERTY
OWNER OF REVENUES
Prosecutor Hasn't Decided
Whether Or Not to Ap
peal New Decision
The billboard law enacted by the
last General Assembly was declared
unconstitutional today by Judge
John J. Walsh of the criminal com
mon pleas court in - a decision sus
taining a demurrer filed by Attorneys
Cullinan & Cullinan, representing
John F. Murphy of the Bridgeport
Bill Posting Co. This was a test
case and was being watched by bill
posters ail over the state.
Judge Walsh declared the law un
constitutional because it deprived a
property owner from . getting com
pensation: from his own property. It
is understood that the matter will be
taken to the supreme court for a
final decision but Prosecutor Huxford
of the common pleas court said today
that he had not yet decided whether
he would take an appeal.
The law, which went into effect
last August, provides that no person
shall have a billboard more than
four feet square on his property and
that a tax of one cent a square foot
shall be imposed by . the state. In
order to bring the question to a legal
test it was decided that Murphy, who
is general manager of the local con
cern, should be arrested. His coun
sel then filed a demurrer.
Windows Shattered in-Sea-view
Avenue When Molt
en Mass is Precipitated
Into Water.
A carload of red hot slag dumped
at 1:45 this afternoon into the har
bor at Cook's Point on the south
western extremity of the site of the
American Tube & Stamping Co. in
the East End, caused to spread
through the city the fear of a heavy
explosion.
The hot slag coming in contact
with the cold waters of the harbor
threw up, with explosive force,, a
cloud of steam. The shock could be
felt throughout the east side, and
several homes in the vicinity were
rocked as if by an earthquake. Win
dows were shattered on Seaview ave
nue and streets nearby.
1 The shock was felt as far south as
the Lake Torpedo Boat " Co. plant.
Several windows were broken in the
Lake plant. Dishes were shaken from
the shelves of the shore house of Otto
Lehmann at the foot of Seaview ave
nue. . '
The explosion shook the ice cream
factory of Jacob Huber opposite the
American Tube & Stamping Co. No
damage was done the building but the
employes were frightened. It is said
that the building rocked to its very
foundation. Employes of the Huber
plant made inquiry in the neighbor
hood of the Union Metallic Cartridge
factory but learned that the explosion
was not that far distant. It was later
surmised that the explosion occurred
inthe factory of the A. T. & S. Co.
Willliam R. Palmer, general super
intendent of the A. T. & S. Co., on in
vestigating the explosion, said that
none had been injured. ; The happen
ing was noX, unusual, he said, although
today the explosive force may have
been heavier than usual.

Administration F orces Win on First Vote By 256 to
160, and on Second Array of Strength Increase
Margin By Vote of 271 to 138 Leaders Con
fident That McLemore Warning Resolutions
Will Be Tabled By Even Bigger Majority
Galleries Crowded to Listen to Stirring
Speeches By Administration Advocates.
i -
Washing-ton, March 7 Two test votes in the House today
on Jhe armed ship question showed an overwhelming majority
upholding the policies of President Wilson.
By a vote of 256 to 160, the House limited to 90 minutes
the debate on the special rule that allowed consideration of the
McLemore resolution.
The second vote came on the adoption of the special rule
itself. This showed a bigger majority for the administration,'
the count being 271 to 138.
Resolution Will Be Tabled
, Immediately the House turned to the four hours' debate,
provided by the special rule, on the McLemore resolution it-!
self. Indications were that, at the end of debate, it would be
tabled by even a bigger majority than was shown -in the pre-1
vious votes. '
Following the two tests of strength, administration leaders
were confident that the President's wishes would be met and
the House, by a big majority, would table the McLemore reso
lution. The second vote removed opportunity for amending the.
McLemore resolution and it was indicated that the measure
would be tabled as originally introduced.
About 6 o'clock this evening the ad
ministration forces will move to table
the McLemore resolution.' Once ta-
bled, the resolution will have gone the
way of the Gore resolution in the Sen
ate and the majority of Congress will
have been placed on record before the
world as demonstrating that it does
not endorse the dissensions against the
President's foreign policy.
With the agitation finally' disposed
of, the President and -Secretary Lan
a'ng will resume the submarine nego
tiations with Germany.
In quick succession today the House
rejected the .proposal to allow antl
adiAinistratian .amendments to the
McLemore resolution and then adopted
the special rule for consideration of
the resolution itself, routing the oppo
sition by votes of 256 to 160 and 271 to
138, respectively.
Immediately after the adoption of
the rule, debate began on the resolu
tion itself, Chairman Flood of the for
eign affairs committee moving to ta
ble it. .
Prospects of a sensational debate
attracted a record crowd to the House
side of the capitol long before, the
doors opened. Men, women and chil
dren came prepared for a long stay.
When the public galleries were thrown
open there was a rush and scramble
and the galleries were filled within five
minutes.
As a preliminary to the big fight in
the House there was a fight of quite a
different nature in the House barber
shop. Two of the negro barbers who
cater- to the Representatives, brought
their argument to a close with a f usi
lade of toilet water bottles and other
barber shop accessories accompanied
by a running flow of language which
was far from parliamentary. The
House police force ended the row by
clapping both the combatants in the
loctoup.
Promptly at 11 o'clock the House
assembled. Speaker Clark was in the
chair and Acting Chairman Pou of the
rules committee was in his seat ready
to submit the special rule under which
the debate would proceed.
. Mr. Pou attacked the McLemore res
olution at the outset.
"It means, in effect, that if an
American disregards a warning that
the United States government will fold
its hands," said he. "Is there a sin
gle red-blooded citizen in this House
or this country, who wants to do that?
"It is charged that the President
wants war. All the imps of hell never
devised a more infamous charge.
"No man, since Abraham Lincoln,
has gone through such a test as the
President has gone through in the last
six months. He has tried to preserve
peace. He would not sacrifice a sin
gle life to make himself President for
lifetime.
"He has support on both "sides of
this chamber. He has support on the
Democratic side and distinguished
support on the othpr. Only the other
day I read a. statement of former
President Taft supporting him."
Applause on both sides of the cham
ber followed his remarks.
As soon as the journal had been
read Mr. Pou offered the privileged .
resolution containing the special rule.
Mr. Pou -asked unanimous consent
for 90 minutes debate on the rule.
There was no objection and the donate
began. Mr. Pou took the floor to open
the fight. -
The first outburst of applause from
the floor came at the outset of Mr.
Pou's speech when he said:
"All the imps of hell never devised
r more infamous lie than the declara
tion that has been made that Presi
dent Wilson wants war."
Representative Campbell, or Kan
sas, Republican member of the rules
committee, announced when Mr.
Pou concluded that if the motion to
close debate on the rule were defeat
ed he would offer a substitute for the
McLemore resolution which would be
a direct warning to Americans to
keep off armed ships.
"There is no question of national
rights involved In this issue," de
clared Mr. Campbell, "nor is there
any great crisis involving the honor
of the United States at this time.
Does anyone contend that an Ameri
an citizen has a right to travel in
an armed cruiser of a nation at war?,
"The . President is asking Congress!
to assume a diplomatic function andj
declare to the world its citizens have1
the right , of. taking passage on the '
armed ' merchantmen of belligerents.
This House is today confronted with
the responsibility of the right to shape '
a diplomatic function which is solely:'
the right of the Executive. The na
tions of Europe are fighting for their
very existence. Millions of men have
been sacrificed in defense of their
countries. We are quarrelling with
those nations to gratify the desire
of people to travel on armed ships. 1 '
The thing today is to avoid war. The
question ought not to hav, bflan
brought here. . Now it la here Vote -squarely
on a resolution to warn citi
zens off ships of the belligerents.
"If this rule is defeated," declared
Representative Harrison, Democrat,
of Mississippi, an administration
leader, "you will not only send Joy to
the hearts of people in a foreign capi
tal, but you stab your own President
in the back." . - .
. At the end of debate of an hour and
a half on the rule, a vote on a motion;
for "the previous question" a mo- ,
tion to end . the debate on the rule -
itself was in order That wrought i
the first test of strength in a roll call, i
