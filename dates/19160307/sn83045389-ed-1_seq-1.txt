First. Mr. Vlrandcis. appeared in 1v!*?!

He said the objection was not based1

appeared fo: tin !tij'ior irct'-rest* and
opposed pending legislation as on tlie.
?weeping statements he made about
liouor traflk- i- arguments. I'a.-ticular
attention was directed to certain quoted
stat? -merits, which were rend by Cannon;
as f-illnws.
"I I.iquor dealing is not wrong. '!e. :

"I' occurred to U!-\" said Dr. Cannon. I
"that, the fact that Mr. IJrnndeis should,
have appeared before a legislative
committee a.* the paid lobbyist of the'
liquor t rattle \voui<i not look w.-li in a
bioirraphy."
Senator Fletcher took issue with the
statement that Mr. Hrandeis was neces-!
sarlly the "lobbyist" of the liquor in- j
terests. Dr. Cannon produced fnc- i
simile, records of the Massachusetts !
legislative docket for legislative conn- '
sel. as required by law. in which Mr.
Hrandeis had recorded his appearance
for the liquor dealers and the brewers'
[ nssociat ions. Dr. Cannon said lie pre-]
sumed that any one who appeared as i
counsel before a legislative committee j
l for the liquor interests would be re- j
I (larded as a "lobbyist." He insisted,
that they would be so designated In |
Virginia
Senator Cummins said it would make
much difference to him whether Mr.]
Hrandeis appeared as the paid attorney
in regard to a question of public
policy or public morals, or whether he
appeared to express bis individual
views.
Dr. Cannon replied that usually
those who appear before legislative
committees as attorneys are paid for;
their services.
MAY UOI.n CIOIIT \ IN \IICWS
\M> VHT III-) KAIII IN I.AWj
Senator Fletcher suggested that an;
attorney might bold to certain per
sonal views a; to tbe correct public j
policy to be pursued and yel be en- j
tirely fair in construing 'he law as {
made.
"Yes." consented Dr. Cannon, "hut j
it is dilllcult for a man to divest him- |
self wholly of his views on questions '
of public policy and be entirely un
biased. Judges arc human, like every
body else. We do not want t?? perse
cute Mr. Hrandeis for having appeared
for liquor organization*. but on so im
portant a matter as naming a posit ion j
lo Hie Supreme Court bench, wo I
thought ii was fair lo inquire whether I
he was entirely unbiased on great j
questions affecting liquor traffle, ami I
whether ?we could net decisions from j
him without prejudice."

allege that the bill is not only dis
criminatory a.s between the Stair and
the individual communities, hut is un
constitutional as well Section 1 7?1 of
the Constitution, they say. expressly
provides that no statute of limitations
shall run against the claim of the State
for taxe*. They regard this: inhibition
as being equally applicable to local
levies.
In meeting this argument Senator
Cannon cited the Constitution to prove
that the Legislature has the authority
to release by general act any individual
of an obligation to the State.
"The powers of the Cciieral Assem
bly." he said, should not have entered
into this discussion. It is sinudy a
question of policy.
"Hut, since the question of consti-'
t ut ii>na lit J has been raised. I submit
my opinion that, under the Constitu

any obligation. Section ?>;? provides
that the General Assembly shall onact
no local, private, or special law re

the State or to any political subdi

During the day the Hermans
launched sudden attacks at two vital

On another sector of tins front, in :hit
Argonne region, titey won a footing in
tlie French lines by a double-mine ex

The attack on Forges followed an .?!
most ceaseless bombardment for tif'een
days of the French positions west of
tlie Mouse, stretching as* far as Mal.in

With tiie coming of dawn tins morn

was doubled, especially in the sector
between liethincourt, east of Malan
court, and the river. Short I.' after
noon the cannonading died away, and
picked infantry corps, leaping from
their trenches, swept forward.
A furious battle ensued in tin; out
skirts and then in the streets of
Forges'. The French fell back, after
a scries of violent engagements, to tho
protection of their positions on the
