Flume Breaks at 3:30 in Morn

Roaring, surging waters awoke the
residents of the. Makikl frtct arly
this morning and called them in ex
cited groups on to the verandas and
Into the streets. "
The Maklkl flume broke. about 3:30
o'clock, and all the drainage from
the mountains above flooded . down
past . the fire station and under the
bungalow homes In the newly opened.
tract. - Telephone calls from the fire
station awakened those who were not
already up and about, and, soon the
whole neighborhood was dressed and
waiting for the flood to either come
swirling In the windows or run off.
H. E, Wescott, the city purchasing
agent, has his home In the direct path
of the diverted waters and was one
of the first to be aroused by the boom
of the oncoming water.. 'The firemen
offered to come over and help erect
a barricade In front of the house to
divert the waters, but I figured that
would only get someone else in trou
ble, so I just thanked them and made
ready to leave in a hurry," he said
this morning. '
Valuable ferns, palms and other
plants were . carried from Wescott's
yard by the flood and a number of
trunks stored under the house had
their contents ruined by the dirty
water. Wescott says that the city will
have to pay him for the damage done
by tMe flood and threatens to bring
suit If It refuses. : .. , , v
"I went under the house with a
flashlight to look after my trunks,
which, contain a number of valuable
Tteepsakes that no money . can pay
for, and found water spurting up
against the bottom of the house," he
says. "1 thought at first that a water
main was broken, but found that the
flood had undermined the Btone foun
dation of the house and was running
under it It was only' Saturday that
repairs made necessary by the last
flood were completed, and today my
house is standing on four ' corners
again as a result of the city's neg
lect to strengthen the flume."
