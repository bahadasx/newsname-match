REP. HARVEY
OF WEBSTER
Displeased With Report of
Committee and Challenges
Gov. Stanley to Make
Request
THAI THE PROBE BE CONTINUED
FlUNKFOKT, Ky., (March, O-The
Probe Committee appointed to
investigate "the charges una
'Countercharges" mado by Rep
resentative Harvey, of Webster
Gonntv. and Representative
Pumphroy, of Fleming County,

an connection with Pamphrey't
-charges.
Tl, nnmmliiAi. mhnrt. nntlrnlr
ignores the charges which were
& i .t .u-u
made by Representative Have
relative to whisky contributions
toward Gov. Stanley's election.
Altho it was the general under
standing that it was the commit
tee's duty to investigates the
charges affecting the Qovenor,
the report contains no word up
on this subject.
The House, however, adopted
the report without dobato and
discharged the committee.
Members of the committee, it is
saV, did not consider that they
wcrochargod, under the resolu-
j'on, with the duty of probing
tue charges maue oy narvey
lrhich prccipated Pumphrey'aa'-
tack upon him.
Representative Harvey to
night issued a statement in
frhich ho expresses emphatic
dissatisfaction with the report.
He repeats hts charges against
Gov. S'aniey, supports them
an affidavit and dares the Gov-
onor to submit to an investiga
tion. The report Harvey declares is a
'compromise' resulting from "the
desperate desire of the Governor
and his supporters to avoid bring
ing out the truth.
Benews Probe Demand
Representative Harvey's state
ment, repeating his charges and
-renewing his demand for an in
vestigation of them is as follows;
"1 have always contended and
have never agreed to anything
bat a thoro and searching inves
tigation. I have not been so
' much concerned as to what the
committee might do, or report as
1 have about getting my deliber
ate traduceis ou the witness
stand and turn on them 'the piti
ieos light of publicity.' I have
never believed that I needed au
investigation for the purpose of
vindicating me, but Ihave anx
iouely sought it that it might
condemn my accusers. I con
tend that the people of the Stale
are entitled to have this dirty
deal shown up in all its ugliness
by a proper nod searching inv;
ligation.
"I do not know why the com
mittee has not seen fit to Investigate
the counter charge of mine that cer
tain whiskey interests have made
large contributions to Gov. Stanleys
campaigns The Governor immed
iately atter this charge of mine in the
House rushed frantically down to the
footlights and informed the Pike Co.
probers that I was a liar and a de
ceiver, that I could not be - believed
and that he had not received contri
butions from the whiskey interests or
the county dividees or any other in
terests.
Says Distiller Gave $25,000
I made the statement on the
floor of the house that ono whiskey
ir an alone had spent $25 0001n two of
Gov. Stanley's campaigns. In sub
stantiation of that statement, 1 sub
mit the following affidavit:
The affiant, Elwno'd Hamilton,
says that he Is S3 years of airo and a
resident of Franklin county, Kr,
that a tow days after the August
primary 1915, he wasjlnvlted by Ool.
E. H. Taylor, Jr.. ptetldent of the
E. H. Taylor. Jr., & Sons, Incorpor
ated, distillers, to his office1 lu the
McOlare Building In Frankfort, Ky.
and pursuant to said invitation he
called on Ool. Taylor at his office
and found no ono there exoept Ool.
Taylor.
Ool. Taylor advised him that be
wis very 'much interested in the
Democratic party in Kentucky and
In its fucura success. Ho also said
he was very much interested in
Got. Stanley and warmly supported
him In his race for United States
Senator in the August primary, 1014.
Ho said prohibitionists bad no
place In the Democratic party,, and
so long as Mr. McChesney adrocated
State-wldo prohibition he ought not
to be permitted to be a member of
the Democratic party. He said the
eleotlou of August, 1915, settled for
all time the question of State-wide
.'prohibition In this state, and that
f thosu of us wl
who had been fighting
nlin in the oounty ought to cease
doing so and Join him In saving the
party. He said he tarnished in the
primary, 1914, for Mr. '.Stanley $15.
000. He furnished this t tare the
party. Atter that election was over
he told Mr. .Stanley tbat nobody
could beat him for Governor, that
be already' had his organization
made, tbat all be bad to do
was t o set the rren t o work
for him that had worked for him in
1014 and his election was assured.
He said that at the August election
1915, in the primary for Governor,
he had spent for Mr. Stanley$lO,000
making a total that he hid spent dur
ing two ycara to save the .Democra
tic party from1 th fanatical -tissue of
prohibition 925,000.

CATHERINE GENTRY.
Examiner for Franklin County.
Throws Down Gauntlet
"1 ask Gov. Stanley if this is not
true to have Col. Taylor make the
denial in the same form as it is made
above.
"Anybody can holler 'Liar! Liar!'
But I dare the Governor and the
Pike County Investigating Commit
tee to summon Ben Williamson, who
is not in Florida but in Ashland, be
fore it with the command that he
bring all documents pertaining to a
deal that was consummated in a
room at the Gait House on Sunday,
October 24, 1915.
"I want the-people to know that
this 'compromise report' is not of
my seeking and I do not believe it
,wou!d ever have been made but for
the desperate desire of the Governor
and his supporters to avoid the
bringing out of the truth in regard
to the money of the whisky interests
which put him across the plate in
the campaign against McChesney and
McDermott and in the November
election."

on the Dixie Flyer No. 94, north
bound, fell under the engine which
partly toppled over and was instantly
killed.
The engineer. Charles Manning,
remained in his cab and was unin

distance from the passenger depot
and was witnessed by about fifteen
Henderson people who were waiiing
for the train
The firemans body could not be
extricated from under the engine
The wrecking crew at Evansville was'
called to lift the huge piece of ma
chinery back tin the tracks so that
the body could be released.
Blame for the accident has not
been definitely decided but it is
thought a split frog was the
cause. A block system is used in
the line and the switches are control
led at the point by an employe in
a switch tower.

ALL HOPE GONE
FOR AGREEMENT
Difference of One Cent Pre-
. vents Settlement of
Minfers' Dispute
New York, March 3. All hope
of negotiating an interstate wage
agreement for the soft cold fields of
the Middle West was virtually aban
doned today, when propositions of
fered by both operators and miners
were voted down by the sub-corn-mittee
representing the two sides.
Some operators and miners expec
ted the sub-committee later in the
day to report a disagreement to the
full joint conference. In this event
a sine die adjournment of the con
ference will likely result, and the
United Mine Workers' policy com
mittee will then outline further ac
tion. The policy dmmittee, if pre
cedent is followed, will order the in
ternational and district officers to en
deavor to negotiate agreement by
States.
A difference of one cent is all that
stands between the contending forces.
Today the mines shaved ' down their
10 per-cent increase demand for dead
work and yardage to 5 per cent, and
also cut the demand for a 20 percent,
advance for day lobor to 10 percent.
The operators moved to cut the
pending tonnage demand of 3 cents
to 2 cents a ton, with proportionate
decreases in the other demands This
was-refused by the miners and the
operators then rejected the 'proposal
of the workers.
