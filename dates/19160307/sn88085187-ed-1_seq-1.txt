Farm That's Made
Parcel Post Famous

Brown has challenged nn
tlon-wlde attention.
Owner of one of the best
managed estate ln the west,
he has materialized some ot
the big tiling- predicted for
I title Ham's pai kage deliv
ery at the time it was launch
ed.
Fully SO |»er rent of the
out-put from the U.ttOO-arre
Nisqually place Is being mar
keted in mall cartons—but
ter, eggH, cheese, poultry,
honey and even cattle and
hogs, the latter n. packing
house prodnctH. Much of it
romes to Tacoma honten.
It Is one of the most in
erestlng and significant
achievements in this new era
ot business.
To Kitchen Door
Farmer Brown —a man
who has put culture Into ag
riculture— has shaken off
the middleman's grip.
He profits more by selling
direct to the consumer, util
izing Uncle Sam as his de
livery man, and the custom
er gets more for his money.
Tile farm has been brought
right to the city kitchen
door.
It wasn't all clear sailing,
and the reason Brown suc
ceeded where many have
failed can he sinned up in
the word SYBTKM.
The first necessity was a
cheap and durable package.
Perfects Packages
There was none on the
market, so he and his farm
hands experimented and fin
ally perfected a carton that
will carry a dozen eggß safe
ly at a cost of 1-5 cent and
one carrying 30 pounds for
1.3 cents.
"A lot of people," explain-

* IF WOO ARE CHEERFPL,
SAYS A BANKER
Character Is whst a man
Is; Reputation is what people
think he Is. The two should
prevail, but may be essen
tially different.
One thing is certain, if a
man expects to work out an
active, forceful career, if he
wishes to achieve ambitions
worth while, be must have a
reputation which amounts to
- something.

Ed Brown, "hailed tbe par
cel post as a medium that
would automatically bring
success to the producer and
cut the cost of living for the
consumer. But there'R noth
ing more automatic about
this than about any other
success.
"It has taken persistence,
experimentation and a lot of
thought."
Collections Good
A woman solicitor was em
ployed to take orders in a
house to house canvass in
Seattle, close by. To earn
her wage she must and does
procure at least five new cus
tomers every day.
Tacoma has also proved a
profitable market for
Brown's products.
Printed order blanks con

mation as to the kind and
quantity of produce wanted
and Its date of delivery.
All parcel post sales are
made on credit, with subse
quent payment by check or
postal money order. Risky?
Not at all.
"We haven't lost $. r i In
three years through failure
of the customer to pay his
bill," declared Brown.
The Financial Side
If the parcel weighs less
than 10 pounds, the postage
Is charged to the consumer;
if more than 10 pounds, the
mailing cost la absorbed at
the farm end.
"How carefully parcel post
marketing must he conduct

that it costs me nhout' 8
cents a dozen to pick eggs,

that the president wants war,"
he said. "All the imps of hell

Congressman Campbell declared
h ewould offer a substitute if the

Chlppetfleld announced that the
president's stand meant either
war or humiliation, while others
declared it was the only policy
which would keep this country
out of the European struggle.
The debate waged back and
forth, growing frenzied at times.
Rumors were revived throughout
the capitol that ihe president
would welcome war, while his
friends strenuously denied the
rumors.

Blame Murder On Gunmen
MYSTERIOUS YOUNG WOMAN IN THE CASE
Five Yeggs
Attack City
Officer Who
Meets Them
Holding Ills own in a des
perate hand-to-hand battle
with five gunmen In the Sti
ver hotel, 131:14 Taroina
avenue, al It o'clock this
mottling. Patrolman Kphriain
J. Nix inii-iii nluii-.lt escaped
with his life.
Incidentally, he ran down one
of the most dangerous gangs of
yeggmen which lias operated ln
Tacoma for many years, a gang
which the police think may be re
sponsible for the murder of Ver
non Lindsay, the cripple, last
night.
Officer Nix was patrolling bis
beat on Tacoma avenue at 2
o'clock this morning when he no
ticed two men, apparently Intoxi
cated, two blocks ahead of him.
One Open* Pirc.
As he approached them, one of
them opened fire with his re
volver. "
When Ihe two gunmen started
to run, Nix gave chase. They
ducked around the corner and en
tered the Silver hotel.
Nix followed. He climbed the
stairs to the door of the room
where they lived.
In answer to his knock, one of
the men appeared at the door
way.
Steps Into Hall.
"Bring out your partner," he
ordered," 1 want to talk with him
a few minutes."
"1 haven't any partner," tbe
man replied. "Come inside If you
think 1 have."
The officer followed him into
an inner hall way. .lust as he got
inside the outer doorway, the
gunman stuck a revolver into his
face, four inches from his nose.
"Stick up your hands!" ordered
the gunman.
Nix slowly raised his hands as
high as hls'shoulders.
(•tin Not lluntly.
Not suspecting thai he had des
perate gunmen to deal with, he
bed left his police revolver in bis
holster.
As he lifted bis hands, suddenly
he clamped bis hands down on
the gunman's revolver and stuck
his forefinger in the trigger.
The two men tussled about the
hallway* Then the gunman let
out a call for help.
Four partners quickly appear
ed. One of them made a lunge
at the policeman with the butt of
his gun. Nix ducked and the gun
made a dent in the door casing.
Goew for Help.
Nix looked up and saw the muz
ales of four revolver leveled at
him.
Like a flash he gave a frantic
jerk at the revolver held by bis
first opponent, and as he wrench
ed it from the man's hands he
fell backward through the door
with It in hia hands.
The yeggs slammed the door
shul on him.
The officer, believing the odds
were too great against him, went
outside the building for help. As
he did so he heard the yeggmen
run upstairs to the back of the
building.
All Carrying Guns.
Nix then went to the home of
Detective Huckaha to get his aid
in cornering the gunmen.
While be was hastening for aid
all five of the gunmen left the
hotel, each one with a revolver ln
ids hand ready for use.
In all, the gang had several re
volvers, one of which w-as found
by the police this morning ln their
room.
Two of the guns had been
stolen from Dob's Loan office in
Tacoma two weeks ago.
The police are making a thor
ough search for the gang of gun
men today.
Ready For Murder.
"Every one of those men had
a ervolver leveled on me," said
Nix today. "There was murder
ln their eyes, if there ever was In
any man's. 1 knew it was now
or never with me.
"Making one last effort. I
forced the revolver out of my
man's hand. The force ot my
jerk threw me barkwsrds out of
the door, and in an instnat the
door slammed and a bolt waa
snapped.
"I waited several moments be
hind the corner, thinking that the'
men might come out. I had the
gunman's revolver. 1 was ready
to shoot to kill
"I knew that I could not hold
the men alone, or expect to cap
ture them. So I rushed to the
home of Detective Huckaba,
acrosH the alley, and awakened
htm. Then I ran back to the ho
tel. But the men bad fled."
