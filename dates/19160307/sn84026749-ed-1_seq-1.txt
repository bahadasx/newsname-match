Three Witnesses Called in. Sen
ate Investigation of Nomi
nee for Supreme Court.
The matter of the bankruptcy pro
ceedings of P. Nennox & Co..
of Lynn, Mass., was subjected to a
rigid Investigation by the subcom
mittee of the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee today In the inquiry as to the
fitness of Louis D. Brandels to be a
Justice of the United States Supreme
Court.
The firm because bankrupt In 1907
during the panic and Mr. Brandels
was accused of having represented
some of the creditors as well as the
firm.
Morris J. Strook a New York law
yeri Abe Stein, of the firm of Stein
& Co., leather merchants In
New York, and James P. Lennox, of
Lynn, Mass., were subjected to a
rigid cross-examination as to the con
nections of Mr. Brandels with the
case.
Bill Never Presented.
Strook, who was on the stand early In
February, was recalled and cross-examined
specifically by Senator Works,
Mho endeavored to draw from the wit
ness the admission that he had acted in
an advisory capacity to Mr, Lennox
while he wan the attorney .In fact for
Stein & Co., one of the largest creditors
of Lennox.
Htrook said he only suggested and
that he had advised Mr. Lennox to
engage Brandels. It appeared from
tho testimony that Brandels had also
been engaged to represent Stein & Co.
In answer to questions by District
Attorney Anderson, of Boston, Strook
stated that such conferences between
creditors and debtors with attorney's
for the purpose of settling Involved
business affairs ucro common during
the 1907 panic.
It was brought out that the Bran
dels firm or one of Its members had
been counsel for another creditor of
Lennox & Co. Strook stated,
however, that Brandels had never
submitted n bill or collected any
money for his services to Hteln.
Stein related the history of his
meeting with Brandels in Boston,
where he was called to consult with
Lennox In regnrd to Mr. Lennox's
business troubles. Rteln said ho was
an Intlmnte personal friend of Len
nox and was anxious to straighten
out his affairs.
The witness declared he would
never have engaged Brandels an his
attorney had be thought Brandels
was representing anybody else.
Lennox told the committeo of his
financial troubles and of his engag
ing Brandels at the suggestion of
Strook. He admitted having signed
an Assignment for the benefit of his
creditors at Brandels' suggestion. The
assignment was not to be used until
Lennox had been consulted. The first
intimation he had, .the witness stated,
that the assignment had been used,
was when he read of bankrupt pro
ceedings against his Arm in the newspapers.

COMMISSIONERS' DUTY PLAIN
Corporation Counsel Upholds in
Every Detail the Law of
March 1, 1889.
Under an opinion of Corporation
Counsel Conrad H. Sjrme. submitted to
the Commissioners today, every able
bodied cltlien in the District, between
the ages of eighteen and forty-five,
with a few exceptions, is subject to
compulsory military duty.
The corporation counsel upholds in
every detail the law" of March 1. 1869,
providing for the enrollment of the
District mllltla, to which the attention
of the Commissioners was recently
drawn by Brig. Oen. William E. Har
vey, commanding the District mllltla.
The law provides that with certain ex
emptions, including officers of tho Gov
ernment. Idiots, lunatics, common
drunkards, vagabonds, paupers, and
persons convicted of Infamous crimes,
every ablebodlcd male c'.tlien in tho
District shall be enrolled In the District
mllltla.
Commissioners' Duty Clear.
Followlnr a careful review of thl
and other statutes "relating to the Hf
trtttuflRI, th Corporation counsel
saysC
"t do not know what particular diffi
culties, may be in the way of the Com
missioners with the provisions of this
statute and 'the performance of the
duties which entails upon them, but 1
am constrained to say that. In my Judg
ment, this law has been in force and
effect since the first day of March, 1109,
and tho duty which It enjoins upon the
Commissioners appears to me to t
clear."
The Commissioners have not yet
adopted the opinion of the corpora
tion counsel, and no consideration has
been given of the means to adopt to
enforce the law.
The law gives the board authority
to require the assessors, at the time
they are making assessments, to make
a list of all persons liable to enroll
ment. In Full Force and Effect.
The Corporation Counsel reviews the
authority under which the mllltla of the
United States and the District of Co
lumbia was "rganlxed. An act approved
February 18, 1909, he states, for the "or
ganisation of the mllltla of the District
of Columbia," specifically recognized tho
act of 1899 as being In full force and
effect.
The enrolled mllltla is not subject to
any duty except when called Into the ser
vice of the United States or to aid the
civil authorities In the execution of the
laws or the suppression of riots.

"Doth tales are lies, plain lies."
ehemently declared Speaker Clark
today, discussing charges emanating
from New York that a German
American lobby Is at work to defeat
Prosldont Wilson In his submarine
fight, and incidentally trying to con
trol thn Democratic Nntlonnl conven
tion for Clark.
"So far as I am concerned. I want

the Speaker.
"Do you know Marsalls?" he wuh

"Never heard of him," the KpenUer
crisply answered.
Congressman Stephens of Nebras

talked to me."
The stories of the alleged German
propaganda were read with deep In
terest at the Whlto House. It was
clearly Indicated that Administration
officials have been considering the

In light of the pending vote on the

10 CONGRESSMEN
TO
Page of North Carolina Fears
Wilson's Policies Invite War.
.Will Not Run Again.
Dcrauso lie believes this country to be
neutral, and because he Is not In ac
cord with the President, Congressman
Robert N. Page of North Carolina, broth'
er of the American ambassador to Great
Ilrltaln, will quit public life.
Coincident with this senimtlonn! an
nouncement Congressman Isaac It. Sher
wood of Ohio, anti-preparedness leader
of the House, announced he would vote
with President Wilson In the present
crisis In Congress, hut said his vot
would bo followed by a letter to 1'ils
constituents announcing his withdrawal
from the raco for re-clottlon.
Mr, Page's statement, followed by
that of Mn Sherwood, created a sen
sation in political circles. The armed
ship Issue, is the immediate cause
of Mr. Page's retirement.
Most startling of tho statements
made by Mr. Page Is this:
"Jesus Christ never uttered a more
profound truth than whon he de
clared; 'Whero your treasure Is there
will bo your hoort also.' "
"I'll stand by tho President now,"
said Congressman Sherwood. "Hut I
cannot seek re-election on a platform
that pledges the party to militarism.
I will give my people, time to pick a
big army man for my successor. My
convictions ngalnst the policy of ex
treme preparedness are such that I
cannot and will not seek re-election
on the President's preparedness plat
form." Thinks War Is Probable.
Mr. Pago virtually says that in ask
ing CongrMu to vote on such nn Issue,
tho President hns confronted every
member with tin- rlk of "washing his
hands" In human blood.
Following his quotation of Christ's
words, Mr. Pago said:
"Tho loan of IWO.OOO.tKX) to England by
American carltnllsts, to say nothing of
the prctlts of munitions manufacturers,
has dcstioyed the semtlanrn oven of
neutrality In tho Vnlted States, and
will probably lead us Into war."
Mr. Pago says ho cannot voto with
tho President on tho armed ship Issue,
and he v. Ill not stultify himself by
voting against his convictions. Such

lower House Indicates, 256 to
160, That It Will Table Res
olution Today.
PREVIOUS QUESTION WINS'
Few Democratic Defections
More Than Offset By Repub
lican Affirmatives.
On the test vote- on the armed
ship controversy the House today
indicated, 256 to 160, that it will
table the McLemore resolution
1 warning Americans not to travel
en armed merchantment of bel
ligerents. By this vote the previous ques
tion of the special rule calling up"
i the McLemore resolution was
adopted. In ordering the previous
question' Ihe'-House cut off all
chance of amendment of thesMc
Lemore resolution or the offering
of a substitute.
Republicans who sought a more
direct vote on the armed ship, con- .
troversy than the McLemore reso
lution provider, urged the defeat
of the previous question.
TABLE EXPECTED.
With tho adoption '"of the previous
question. It became practical certain
that the rule Itself will be adopted and
tho McLemore resolution will be laid
on the table late today by an increased
majority over the Initial vote.
There woro a few Democratic defec
tions on the preliminary vote, but
those were rnoro than offset by Repub
lican voles for tho previous question.
A stirring debate of an hour ond a
half preceded the llrst of the threo roll
calls scheduled In tho House today.
Gnllerlcs crowded with men and women
who camo to spend tho entire day
watched the exciting scones on iha
tloor below, where practically the en
tire membership of the House was en
gnged In tho struggle brought on by
the President himself.
Speaker Clark warned the galleries
that any manifestation of approval or
dlsappioval would result In an order
cuearlng the galleries.
After the declsivo Vote of the previous
question on the rule, the roll call was
ordered on the adoption of the rule
itself, and this Is to be followed by
four hours of general debate on tho
McLemore resolution.
That the McLomoro resolution will
now bo uncoicmonlously tabled Is prac
tically a foregone conclusion, Members
tho McLemore resolution will bo laid
tholr vital opportunity when the
previous question was parried.
Tho McLemoro resolution Is so drawn
that many supporters of c, resolution of
warning will vote against It because
of Its phraseology. On the Initial vote,
upon which virtually depended the fato
of the Administration's request for a
showdown In Congress on the armed
ship Issue, the break away from party
lines was overwhelming.
Thronirs At Capitol.
The scenes about tho House wing of
the Capitol were typical of tho "big
days" that come now and then on Capi
tol Hill. Fashionably attired women
clamored for admission to the galleries
along with tho "plain people."
Sllk-hatted men Importuned door
keepers side by side with the voter
from tho rural district.
Great throngs collected In tho House
corridors long before tho opening hour-r
11 o'clock Tho House, galleries wert
filled to stnndlng room capacity berorp
