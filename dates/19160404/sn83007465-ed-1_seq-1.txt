K1 Paso, Tex.. April 3. .Mexican
reports had it that Villa and another
band of followers were moving on
Chihuahua City to persuade the gar
risen then- to revolt and join him
against the Americans. These re
port?, brought bore by travelers
were scouted by Mexican Consul
Garcia.
While th?"? bandit's in iill command
was S'>a11**rt-fl by tin battle of Gui-r
rcro, it is believed lure that Villa
h^< several other large bodies d:posed
at convenient positions on the
continental divide, and that Col
Podd may come in contact with them
at anv time. While the search for
Villa continues Col Dodd will seek
to destroy armed bodies of Villa
forces which are a constant menace
to the line of American eominnn'*
cations.
There is no light 011 the recent
operations of the Carranza forces.
What assistance the troops of the defacto
government are giving Gen.
Pershing is not known.

Tteports from Mexican sources in

Francisco Villa had header toward

The absence of any offielai news

Dodd vast Wednesday, has considerably
dashed the hopes of those who
saw in the victory the beRinninR of
the end of the bandit's career. At
the sano time, it is pointed out tha?
the American cavalrymen have a formidable
task before them in searching
the barren mountain wastes
where Villa is supposed to have taken
refuse. The fact that no further
fighting has been reported is taken
as an indication that the bandits
have been effectually scattered by

About 'ilrxinuw
There is something of a mystery
attached to the movement of Mexican
troops at points close to the border.
It is known that large bodies of Carran/a's
soldiers have been removed
from camps in the interior to various
places within 20 miles of the international
line, hut no explanation has
been given of these maneouvers beyon;!
a general intimation that the
de facto government is anticipating
possible action by the followers of
Kellx Diaz, who is now considered the
bead of the C'ientifico party.
Most of the stories hrmieht from 1
the Interior are contradictory, especially
those from Mexican sources. .
American refugees agree generally i
In deserihiug conditions as alarming. I
,but they invariably refused to be '
quoted, on the ground that they >-x* .
oect to return to Mexico and .ire i
afraid of arousing prejudices against *
them. Their stories are offset by the
4
fact that several of their number who (
fled across the border after the Co- l
iunlbus massacre, have returned to 1
their former homes convinced that '
they have nothing to fear.
