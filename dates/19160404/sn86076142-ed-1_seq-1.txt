FORTY MILES OF LOCAL MINE WORKINGS
CONNECTED IN
In th next ten days the air connection between the Halifax and
Buckeye on the 120 foot level will be holed through completing an
event that will be of Inestimable value to both properties. This will
establish an underground avenue by which every working mine In the
Tonopah district will be connected and making a continuous passage
extending for a distance of over 40 miles from the Halifax to the Ex-
tension and Victor. In an air line of almost three miles from the
eastern to the western extremity of the camp.
Yesterday the Halifax with two shifts made a footage of 8 feet
and the Huckeye made two feet with one shift reducing the inter-
vening distance between the headings to 7S feet. Both companies
began crossculting at a distance of about lotto feet east of their res-
pecllve shafts where a north crosscut was begun. The distance in
Halifax ground was 387 feet while the Huckeye had only 155 feet to
do before reaching Its sideline. '
The effect of this improvement will be to reduce the temperature
in the lowest workings of both mines to a sensible degree so that
work may be conducted without any serious interruption.

LONDON, Apr. 4. Figures prepared by the British meteorological

of weather conditions. - '
Generally, the assumption has been that Zeppelins are fair-wea-
ther craft, and dare venture forth only in light airs and on dark nights,
that even moderate winds were dangerous to them, and that snow 0
would be fatal, but every one of these theories Is disproved by the offi-
clal figures for the twenty-one occasions on which they have visited
England. The Zeppelins have come in virtually every phase of the
moon, from new to full. They have had the wind from every quarter
of the compass, and with wind that has ranged from "light airs" to 4
"strong breezes." The thermometer has ranged from freezing to
sweltering summer heat. There have been skies of every variety;
there has been mist on several occasions; rain still more often. Dur-
ing the raid of March 6 there was winter weather of considerable
severity, with heavy snowfall in progress and squalls of wind. Bombs 4
were dropped upon one town during a snow squall so bitter that the
