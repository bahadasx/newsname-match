ENDS HEARINGS FOR 1917.
Secretary Daniels Closed a Three Days'
btatement.
Washington, April 3. The house
naval committee today ended its pro
longed hearings on the 1917 naval ap
propriation bill. Secretary Daniels
closed a three-dav statement before
the committee with a final appeal t
support of the administration's iive
year building programme. A sub-com
mittee will begin immediately framing
tne Din.
It became known tonight that a dp-
cided effort would be made to provide
for six capital ships, two dreadnoughts
and four battle cruisers as a com
promise between the recommendations
of the secretary and of the navy gen
eral board.
Mr. DaWiels parried all evforts todav
to get from him a statement as to
what relative place among naval pow
ers the United States should occupy.
He said the five-year programme he
naa mapped out would not put the
country in second place, in his judg
ment, and that the present congress
couia not De asked to make up for the
deficiencies of twenty years past. At
the close of the European war. he said,
he believed a great opportunity would
come for international limitation of
armament and with a strong buildine
programme adopted the United States
would be in a better position to urge
that movement successfully that if its
fleet -was weak.
Representative Butler of Pennsylva
nia, republican, assailed the secre
tary's recommendations for a govern
ment projectile factory. He asserted
that the specifications for navy armor
piercing shells were so high that they
could not be met by manufacturers
and also declared he had reason to
believe that the specifications for navy
14-inch guns and other material had
been revealed during Mr. Daniels' ad
ministration to the Russian and Ger
man governments. He suggested that
Rear Admiral Strauss, chief of ord
nance, be asked to produce a letter to
the Krupp company of Germany.

WILY VILLA HAS
Scouts Are Endeavoring to
Scattered Band of Bandits
CAVALRY ARE YET RIDING
General Pershing's Report Contains News That a Part of the
Sand is Moving in the District Northeast of Guerrero
Peons Display Liberality in Imparting Misinformation to
United States Troops Information Received at El Paso
is to the Effect That Villa, Unwounded and With an Es
cort of Only Eight Men, Was at Satevo, Fifty Miles
South of Chihuahua, Two Days Ago Same Informant
Declares Villa Has Not Taken Any Part in the Fighting
With Either Caranza or United States Troops.
San Antonio. Tex, April 3. The fear
expressed yesterday at army headquar
ters mat t ranclsco Villa has escaped
from the region in which General Per
shing's cavalry columns ae operating
became a conviction tonljrht.
General Pershing's report, received
after noon, contained the news that at
least a part of the dii;p-rd Viila
force that was driven from Guerrero
March 29 was still moving in the dis
trict northeast of that place, but no
mention of Villa's whereabouts was
made. The report was dated yester
day. Cavalry Riding Hills and Plains.
Six columns of cavalry were yet
riding the hills and plains in that sec
tion, while scouts were endeavoring to
pick up the trail of the cattrcd
bands, as well as that cf their fugitive
chief. One force of Villa's men. esti
mated at 100, commanded by Colonel
lltran. was located near Racineva,
about 23 miles northeast of Guerrero,
and information was gathered tnat in
dicated the remainder of the four or
five hundred still were in that region.
Xo reference was made in that report
of an encounter that was mentioned in
press despatches from the front.
False lnformationLibsral!y Supplied.
Information gathered from various
source and con.irmeil by Gt-ncrnl Pen
shing indicated that the intelligence
otnees of the punitive force were hav
ing to contend with dltticuhies created
by the receipt of misinformation lib
erally supplied in districts through
which Vi.la or his followers had passed
(irncral Pershing also reported that he
had difficulty in securing reliable
guides.
His statement that It had been re
ported to him that Colonel Cano had
engaged a Villa force in a fight on the
same day that the Americans were
driving the bandits from Guerrero
served to allay the fear that had arisen
here that Cano "had revoltid. a report
that appeared well founded.
Scouts Must Locate Villa.
Which w:y Villa has gone Is now
largely a question for General Per
shing's scouts to answer. It was
pointe dout at General Fun Eton's head
quarters that once the trail was picked
out. the troops would resume the chase
further into the interior, although it
was realized that this second phase of
the punitive expedition's work would
be far more difficult that was the first.
It is not improbable, it wis said, that
more troops than those already in
Mexico will be required.
VILLA, UNWOUNDED, SO MILES
SOUTH OF CHIHUAHUA CITY.
Bandit Chief Said to Have Been Ac
companied by Only Eight Men.
EI Paso. April 3. Francisco" Villa,
unwounded and accompanied by only
eight men. was at Satevo, SO miles
south of Chihuahua City, two days
ago. according to Information received
here today from Mexican sources
sources which have proved usually re
liable in the past.
Sixty Miles Ahead of Troops.
If this information is correct it bears
out previous reports that the bandit
chief is headed toward ParraU and is
leading his American pursuers by at
least 60 miles. The nearest point to
Satevo which the American troops are
known to have reached is San Antonio,
60 miles to the northwest.
On Familiar Route.
The route said to have been taken by
lila is one with which be is thor
oughly familiar and which, indeed, is
known among the peons as "Pancho's
road." From Guerrero it leads across
the continental divide through the
Bachinlba Pass into a broad valley
which runs east to San Andres. Villa's
old headquarters, thence south to San
ta 1 sabel. the scene of v ilia's massa
ere of IS American mining men, and
then southeast through Satevo to Par
ral.
The man who brought the story of
Villa's arrival at Satevo here gave a
circumstantial account of the bandit's
manoeuvres and plan of campaign.
V hile his story is Impossible of vorl
flection, his own credibility is vouched
for by reputable American business
men who have employed him for sev
eral years.
Villa Has Not Taken Part in Fighting.
"Villa." he said, "has never taken
part in any fighting with either Ameri
can or Carranza troops. He left the
mam body of his troops in the Guerre
ro district with orders to oppose as
far as they could the American ad
vance. At the same time peons were
instructed to give information freely
to American officers, always provided
that the information was false. The
story of Villa being wounded w
carciuuy concocted for the express
purpose or misleading General Per'
shing and Colonel Dodd Into the belief
that the bandit was in hiding in the
mountains nad thereby inducing them
to spilt their forces into small searca
Ing parties who would waste their
time In the wild Sierras while Villa
was making his way safely south
ward."
This part of the story is given color
by the admission of General Pershing
today that his Intelligence department
has been given much misleading- In
formation and that it was becoming
more difficult to secure reliable guides.
continuing his story, the man said
"The American officers were fooled
at first, but they have a fair know
ledge of the real situation now and the

Their only chance of catching up with
Villa Is that they have a good road
and should not be handicapped by rbe
pruuiem or lorage and water. Tho
trail from San Antonio to Satevo leada
through a bread valleys where thera is
generally plenty of water at thin tlmii
of the year and which is fairly fertile
and well cultivated. Of course, tha
peon farmers will try to conceal their
grain, but American eoid and silver
will bo a temptation manv of them -u
be unable to resist.
Must Get Him This Side of Torreon.
"If they can catch up with Villa, be
fore he gets Into the Torreon district
tbey ought to be able to kill or cap
ture him. but if be is able to Join
forces with Canuto Reyes they will
have a diflicult task ahead of them."
Mexican officials here and in Juarcs
refused to discuss the probability ol
Villa being close to ParraU but thy
showed no Inclination to belittle the
story.
EVIDENCE OF CO-OPERATION
BY CARRANZA TROOPS
Disposes of Rumor That Colonel Cano
and Command Had Joined Villa.
Washington, April 3. Evidence Of;
co-operation by C'arranza troops with
the American forces hunting Viila, ap
parently disposing finally of rumors
that Colonel Cano and his command
had deserted to Villa, came to the war
department late today from General
Pershing. He reported an engagement
on March 29. presumably rear Guer
rero. between Cano's troops and one of
the band sinto which Colonel Dodd
scattered the main Villa force.
As this clash, in which Manuel Booo.
leader of the outlaws, is said to have
been killed, occurred on the same day
that Colonel Dodd struck the Villa
army, officials were convinced that the
Carranza columns were actively co
operating with the Americans.
This seems to dispose finally of the
rumor of disloyalty on the part of Col
onel Cano." Secretary Baker said in a
formal statement. Previous reports
had caused officials to doubt Cano's
loyalty and General Pershing's des
patch was received with great satis
faction. TOLEDO STREET CAR CO.
