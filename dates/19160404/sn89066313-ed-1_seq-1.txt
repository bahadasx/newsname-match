LONG FIGHTOVER $150
Seven Law vers in Case
Brought to Circuit Court
From Harrisburg.
Seven lawyers, two counties, a farm,
cows, chickens, horses and potatoes
are mixed up together in the suit in
the Boone County Circuit Court of
Albert Keith of Harrisburg against
W. H. Morgan of Harrisburg, for $130.
The case, which began early this
morning, was still being threshed out
by the attorneys before the jury late
this afternoon.
The case has caused much interest
among the farmers of Boone and How
ard counties, as the farm is on the
county line. Both parties are well
known in that community. Keith
brought suit against Morgan last
December at Harrisburg, claiming
that Morgan was indebted to him and
his son Bud for work done on Mor
gan's farm. The justice of peace gave
Keith judgment for $100, and Morgan
appealed the case.
Morgan meanwhile has brought a
replevin and possession suit against
Keith. These suits are to be tried in
the Circuit Court at Fayette. Morgan
claims that he paid Keith $120 too
much.
In the case of the City of Centralia
against John McGraw, appealed from
the police court, the defendant dis
missed the appeal and the judgment
of the police court was affirmed.
The court issued a decree perfect
ing title in the suit of Silas It. Hazel
against the Inhabitants of the town of
Ashland and others.
In the case of John Eisle against C.
J. Helmick and others, a suit on a note.
the court rendered Judgment for the

COMMERCIAL CLUB
RETAINS PRESIDENT
Prof. L. M. Defoe Is Chos
en Unanimously to Serve
Second Term.
SHOWS YEAR'S WORK
W. L. Nelson, Odon Guitar,
E. C. Anderson and W. C.
Knight Other Officers.
Some things the Commercial Club
did last year:
Backed the $100,000 hotel propo
sition. Made possible p.ivLng of Fyfer
Hill.
Brought more conventions here
than in any previous year.
Co-operated in getting the city in
surance rates reclassified.
Worked for good roads and the
Old Trails Highway.
Prof. L. M. Defoe was unanimously
re-elected president of the Columbia
Commercial Club at the annual meet
ing in the club's rooms last night. W.
U Nelson, assistant secretary of the
State Board of Agriculture, was elect
ed vice-president, to succeed Claud
Wheeler who lias moved fiom Colum
bia. Odon Guitar, K. C. Anderson and
Dr. W. C. Knight were elected mem
bers of the board of directors to suc
ceed W. L. Nelson, Alex Bradford and
Marshall Gordon.
President Defoe outlined the work
of the 'Commercial Club for this last
year and told of the prospects for the
coming year. His suggestions includ
ed forming a convention committee to
bring more state and national meet
ings to Columbia; combining of com
mercial clubs of Missouri towns to aid
interburan railroad building, and in
creasing membership pledges to the
Commercial Club.
"It has been largely due to the agU
tation of the Commercial Club that"
the new Daniel Boone Tavern, which
is to be erected this summer, is pos
sible," said President Defoe. "But this
has been only one of the conspicuous
achievements of the clun. The back
ing of the movement to pave Fyfer
Hill, which stood out as the worst
piece of road near the town, was an
achievement due in a large part to
ths club.
"Exactly what part the club has
played in bringing people to Colum
bia, through conventions and in co
operation with other agencies, is diffi
cult to estimate. We do know that in
the last year Columbia has had more
visitors and more conventions than in
any previous year. This was In part
due to the Thanksgiving football
game.
"If the city insurance classification
is reduced from the four-and-a-half
to the three-and-a-half class, $7,500
will be saved annually in insurance.
"We have done many detailed things
every day. We have worked for good
roads and the Old Trails Highway;
we have brought the merchants clos
er together through the weekly noon
day luncheons, and wc have taken a
part in civic affairs. The bringing
together of the people interested in
the welfare of Columbia has always
been the motive for the work of the
Commercial Club."

COLCMBIA'S ELECTIOS IS QUIET
Only 22:. Had Voted at 3 o'clock This
Afternoon.
Today, while many Missouri towns
and cities arc at the climax of hitter
municipal political campaigns, Colum
bia is quietly electing four council
men and members of the school board,
and voting on the regular increased
levy for school purposes. There is
no contest except that only two of
the three nominees for the school
board can be elected. The election is
a confirmation of the Democratic
nominations a month ago.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon about
223 voters had registered their choice.
The vote on the city officers is slight
ly under that for the school levy. In
the First Ward 100 votes had been
cast at 3 o'clock. The Second Ward
led with 131 votes. One hundred votes
had been cast in the Fourth Ward and
ninety in the Third.
At Chandler's livery stable, the
Third Ward polling place, the main
issue of the day was discussion of
the last clause on the page of In
structions issued to the judges and
clerks. The paragraph read: "If you
need chairs, tables, refreshments or
supplies of any kind, call up 279, city
marshal." The election officials said

MORE TROOPS OVER BORDER
Soldiers, Relieved to Re Fifth Caiulry,
fio From Columbus, S. M.
By United I'ress-.
WASHINGTON, April 4. That ad
ditional American troops were sent
across the Mexican border at Colum
bus, N. M., two days ago, was an
nounced officially this afternoon.
It is thought that this new force
was the Fifth Cavalry. It probably
will be used in mantainirig the lines
of communication.
CADET BAMS NO!
Claiming Unfair Treatment,
Musicians Won't Play at
Athletic Games.
The Unhersity Cadet Band at a
meeting jesterday afternoon voted
unanimously not to play at the High
School Day track meet, the Missouri
Valley Conference meet or the opening
of the new baseball field next Satur
day. The vote was an outcome of a
misunderstanding between the mem
bers of the band and C. L. Brewer,
director of athletics.
According to members of the band,
the athletic department last spring,
through Mr. Brewer, promised each
member of the band a free yearly ac
tivity ticket in return for services of
the band at the football games. Tick
ets were issued to the band members
for the football games only, it being
explained that the supply of activity
tickets was exhausted, but that more
would be issued later. At the opening
of the basketball season a request for
tickets met with a refusal, according
to the band men.
Yesterday the band was asked by
Mr. Brewer to play at the baseball
game Saturday and the two big track
meets in return for two complimentary
tickets each for the baseball games.
This proposition was refused.
Mr. Brewer had not been informed
of the action when seen this after
noon. "I know of no controversy between
the athletic department and the band,"
he said. "The request I made was
merely that the members give their
services to help make the opening of
the new baseball field, High School
Day and the Missouri Valley Confer
ence meet a success. These are Uni
versity affairs and should receive the
support of every student. Every prom
ise I have made them in the past has
been kept, so far as I know. We ap
preciate the co-operation of the band
at athletic events. The members do
not receive the credit they deserve."
Mrs. Sarah Frazier Married.
Mrs. Sarah Frazier of Columbia and
J. II. Nichols of Moberly were married
at Mrs. Frazier's home, ,311 Price
avenue, at 3 o'clock this afternoon by
the Rev. A. W. Pasley. They left this
afternoon to visit relatives in Mober
ly. They will make their home in
Centralia. Mr. Nichols is a retired
farmer.

WASHINGTON, April I. The issue

SETS HKJH IIIEAL FOR LAWYER
J. LtonliiTger imils Sajs He Must Ac
quire Public Point of VIcii.
J. Lionberger Davis, vice-president
and head of the legal department of
the St. Louis Union Trust Company,
spoke on "The Lawyer as a Public
Servant" this morning in the lecture
room of the Law Building.
"Instead of being mere representa
tives of private interests," said Mr.
Davis, "lawyers should acquire the
public point of view. The country,
today, needs their services just as
much as it did those of Alexander
Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and Abra
ham Lincoln in earlier times.
"If a lawyer is to be more than a
paid servant he must study the so
cial and economic conditions of his
community. Vice and crime must be
controlled by the public, and it is the
lawjer, especially trained for the
work, who should be the leader of the
crusade. "The judge should also be a public
servant. As chief official of the court
it is his sacred duty to 1 eep the ad
ministration of justice above reproach
and to interpret the law with econom
ic and social justice.
"The largest field for the lawyer
as a public servant is that of interna
tional law. The only thing that con
trols man's relation to man is law.
Upon the lawyer lies the responsi
bility of bringing about the 'federation
of the world.' "
