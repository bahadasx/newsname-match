MAJOR TENNEY
PASSES AWAY
Distinguished Seldior, Lawyer and
Greatly Beloved Citizen, Dies
at Lexington. ,
t v (t. !,
Major Otis Scth Tenney, died at
his apartments in Lexington Friday
morning o paralysis.
Major Tcnncy's invalidism had
covered a period of two years, but
bed had been bedfast only three
wedks. In spito of physical afflic
tion, his mental faculties remained
unimpairsd andhc retained'Tns in
tcr6st iri pcoplo ami affairs. With
iKi shutting down of winter, out-
Joor drives had been denied him,
but in his wheel-chair ho moved
about the corridors of Merrick
Iiodgc, in which building ho had
apartments; received his friends
and enjoyed to tjo last tho. evening
of a life remarkable in its span.
Ho was said ,tq,bo a man without
an enemy. Hig ioith in, humankind
nevor dimmed, tho world was his
friend and he had abundant proof
always of tho love which tho com
munity bore him. Affliction could
not shut the, sunshine from his lifc,'
and gentleness rarely parallelcd're
mained unruffled.
Since 1847 Major Tenney had
been a Kentuckian, and since 1882
had been a resident of Lexington.
In the law ho was regarded as a
master; as a soldier ho made a rec
ord for distinguished gallantry, but
it, was as a gentle, unassuming,
Christian gentleman that he will live
in the hearts of all who had tho
.-pri,vilegojo calling him friend..
Major Tenney celebrated his
ninety-third birthday December 4
As on anniversaries for a number
of -years, his friends filled his apart
ments with flowers and ho "was re
cipient of many letters of congrat
ulation. Among marks of esteem
that especially touched him since he
had been an invalid was at tho No-
," vember election when tho officers of
the precinct in -which he long had
been a voter moved the poll to his
apartment long enough for him to
cast his ballot. He was an intense
patriot and the vote ho cast that
day his last kept unbroken a rec
ord of participation in public nffnirs
in which ho took lively pride.
To every Confederate Veteran
Major Tenney was a brother, and
his death will como as a personal
berenvemont to each of them. As
long as his health permitted he was
nnunmissing comrade at reunions.
At tho close of tho war, when ho re
turned to Mt. Sterling, ho was de
nied the right to resumo tho prac
tice of law, tho judge holding that
the expatriation act of 18G2 raised
a bar in short, that ho had forfeit-
