GREAT MYSTERY

DODD'S CAVALRY

Border Anxiously Awaiting
News of Another Big
Fight ®With Foes
El Paso, Tex., April 3—Francisco
Villa has again become the man of
mystery. Almost within the grasp of
the American cavalry, after the battle
of Guerrero, the bandit is reported to
day to have slipped- through the net
closing about him and to have cov
ered the trail of his flight.
Mexican reports had it that Villa
and axband of his followers were mov.
in.g on Chihuahua with the intention
of getting the garrison of the de facto
government to revolt and join him
gainst the Americans. These re
ports brought here by travelers were
Ecouted by Mexican Consul Garcia.
While the bandit's main command
•was scattered at the battle of Guer
rero, it is believed here that Villa has
Beveral other large bodies of men dis
posed at convenient positions on the
continental divide and that Col. Dodd
and his troopers may come in con
tact with them at any time.
There is no light on the recent oper
ations of the Carranza forces against
the Villa bands.
Traffic over the Mexico-Northern
railway is becoming more active since
the advent of the American expedi
tionary forces in the Casas Grandes
and Madera districts. A freight train
arrived from Casas Grandes this
morning. Later in the day a mixed
passenger. «nd. freight train started
out for Pearson, thirty miles south of
Casas Grandes. The passengers in
cluded many Americans returning to
•the Interior after flight to the border
following the Columbus, N. M., mas
sacre.
FIGHT IS RUMORED.
Camp of Gen. J. J. Pershing at the
front, April 2.—By aeroplane to CoJ
onia Dublan and by radio to Colum
bus, N. M., April 3.—American cav
alrymen encountered a fleeing force
of Villa men near early today
Rnd sounds of firing have been heard
from that direction but no report has
been made to headquarters as to the
results.
The mountains of Guerrero are be
ing combed thoroughly for Francisco
Villa by the American forces but noth
ing has been learned as to his where
abouts other than that captured ban
c'its said he was being carried farther
Into the mountains in his jolting
coach.
Gen. Pershing announced today that
Infantry is to be used for mountain
climbing In the search for Villa, coop
crating with the cavalrymen, who have
borne the brunt of the five days' pur
suit of the broken bandit. The infan
trymen have been going through hard
ening preparation in hill climbing
marches for about two weeks and their
officers say they are in excellent phys
ical trim.
The troops were closely behind Villa
yesterday, entering the village of
shortly after he had fled from it.
Every preparation had been made
for an engagement at the village but
It failed to develop.
There have been a number of minor
skirmishes in the vicinity of the vil
lage, two scouts reporting today that
they encountered two Villa men on Its
outskirts yesterday and fought for five
minutes without casualties.
American air scouts are now flying
over the entire Villa territory and are
now carrying dispatches from the
front to the field base and field head
quarters. Motor trucks also have
been able to penetrate the mountain
waste almost as far as the territory
occupied by the cavalry under Col.
George A. Dodd.
MANY RUMORS AT BORDER.
El Paso, Tex., April 8.—Reports
from Mexican sources in the interior
received here today asserted Francis
co Villa was headed toward Chihuahua
City and that his emissaries were at
tempting to seduce the garrison of
that town from their allegiance to the
de facto government.
Nothing was said in the reports of
Villa's alleged injuries, an omission
which helped to confirm the opinion
already freely expressed on the bor
der that the bandit's wounds were an
Invention of his own, reported with
the intention of deceiving his pursu
ers.
The absence of any official news
from the front since the defeat of the
Villistas near Guerrero by Col. Dodd
last Wednesday has considerably
dashed the hopes of those ,who saw
in the victory the ^beginning of the
end of the bandit's career.

(HOLLAND WORRIED
IS FEAR OF
PEOPLE FEARING COMING SPRING
CAMPAIGN MAY VIOLATE
THEIR NEUTRALITY.
The Hague, April 1. (Delayed) —The
Associated Press is. again informed
that all apprehensions regarding any
impending embroilment of Holland
with any foreign power are wholly un
founded but a considerable section of
the public persists in believing that
the expected coming offensive by the
allies, supposedly planned at the Paris
conference, holds the possibility of
danger to Holland's neutrality. Public
anxiety has been considerably allayed
but has not wholly disappeared, in the
absence of a statement from the gov
ernment to clear up the situation.
The Hague agency of the Bank of
The Netherlands was the scene of a
5
paper. The Amsterdam
fleeted a feeling of uneasiness
a temporary recovery, it closed
pressed.
Not Enough Grain.
Holland's reserves of wheat are
practically exhausted and the Associ
ated Press is informed on the very
highest authority that the government
intends to buy 100,000 tons in Ameri
ca in addition to the normal 60,000
monthly, in order to form the needed
reserve. Several Dutch ships have
been requisitioned under the new ship
law to bring these supplies from
America. The disappearance of the
reserve is due to the failure of the
Holland-America and other steamship
companies to fulfill completely their
contract to transport 60,000 tons of
wheat and flour and 75,000 tons of com
from North and South America, owing
to the delay caused by war incidents.
A hundred thousand tons of corn
is also needed every month but only
75,000 is now: received.

FRIENDS OF CHICAGOAN CALL
HIM VICTIM OF SPOILS
SYSTEM IN POLITICS.
B. Sachs belonged are today complet
ing arrangements for the funeral of
the late head of the Chicago municipal
tuberculosis sanitarium and head of
the National Tuberculosis association,
who was found dead from poison yes
terday.
Dr. Sach's body was found in a room
of the Edwards sanitorium at Naper
ville, where he was chief of the medi
cdl staff. His death came as a climax
to a controversy over his manage
ment of the municipal sanitarium.
Statements by his, friends asserted
that charges of mismanagement broke
his heart as he had devoted a long
term of years to the Institution.
Charges of contractors who were en
gaged in part of the construction work
at the sanitarium were to the effect
that 'Dr. Sachs might have saved the
city more than $100,000 by the use of
greater care and better judgement.
Friends of Dr. Sachs issued state
ments in which they declared that he
had not committed suicide but had
been, "killed by the spoils system of
city politics." The Women's City club
and other organizations have issued
statements in connection with his
death, urging voters to "free the insti
tution from political interference",
at Tuesday's election of aldermen.
Dr. Sachs was born in Russia forty
eight years ago and fled to this country
from Odessa in 1892 to escape religi
ous persecution. He spent most of the
past twenty years in conducting a
fight against tuberculosis and is said
to have .died a comparatively poor
man.

representative what his views were on
the situation, replied:
"Optimistic, of course. There is noth.'

si
Yesterday's fighting on the whole
was not unfavorable to the French, it
is authoritatively stated. The object
of the Germans was to clear the ap
proaches to Ft. Douaumont and 15,000
men were thrown forward on the mile
and a half line between Douaumont
fort and the village of Vaux. The at
tacking force succeeded in crossing a
little ravine which hitherto had stop
ped them and in entering the Call
lctte wood. Further east they dis
lodged the French from the last ruined
houses of the village of Vaux, but the
French positions were so placed as to
make it practically impossible for the
Germans to debouch from the village.
Vigorous French counter attacks drove
them back to the upper fringe, of the
Caillette wood.
The total result of the very formid
able effort they had put forth was a
gain for the Germans of about 500
yards of terrain, more than offset, it is
affirmed, by the very heavy losses they
had endured. On the west of the
river the Germans attacked t,he Avo
court blockhouse in a no less deter
mined manner but again met with
complete failure, the observers de
clare.
British
Coast Raided.
Zeppelin raids over the east coast
of England and Scotland on three suc
cessive nights have caused consider
able alarm in the communities where
the bombs were dropped. In the raidg
on the northeast coast of England on
Friday and Saturday nights, fifty-nine
persons were killed and 166 wounded.
The raid Sunday night extended to
Scotland, the first time Zeppelins
have ventured that far north. The
casualties have not geen given out by
the government.
Aircraft have been active around
Verdun. The French brought down
three German machines, but Berlin
asserts that the aerial combats have
resulted in their favor. Both side3
have dropped many bombs on military
depots at various points.

SOOTH SEA ISLES
San Francisco, April 3. —That Japan

day by Dr. Frederick Starr, professor
of anthropology, University of Chica
go, who was en route to Chicago from
the orient after six months' research
work in Japan and Korea.
"Japan," said Dr. Starr, "has no in
tention of withdrawing from the La
drone or Marshall islands, which she
has taken from Germany and which lie
about midway between the Philippines
and Hawaii. She has already under
taken expansive schemes with refer
ence to the postal service, telegraphs
and cables of these possessions. She
is sending settlers in quantity to
them."
"Since the war began In Europe,"
continued Dr. Starr, "more than 1,000
new millionaires have beeri\ made in
Japan. Extravagant ideas have taken
possession of the Japanese nation and
a wave of speculation Is sweeping over
the country."
Dr. Starr said also that Japan's trade
with. India had increased enormously
since the war and that in this develop
ment lay the possibility of future com
mercial competition with Great Britain
which might endanger the friendship
that now exists between the two na
tions.

still at liberty, but the police say they
expect to arrest him before night.
Hudson, who captured the British ship
Matoppo at sea, will be arraigned in
court in connection with the Pan
nonia plot as soon
as
the case against
him is completed.
George Haller and Otto Milleder, ar
rested last night and held under minor
charges as Hudson's fellow conspira
tors, admitted today that they had fre
quent conferences with Hudson con
cerning his plans to blow up British
vessels lying at piers here. They said
they had received money from him to
buy dynamite, a motor boat, revolvers
or other supplies, but asserted that
they spent his money for their own
benefit and pawned revolvers he
bought for them.
"I was working Schiller for all I
could get,"
Milleder. "I got about
$30 out of him to buy dynamite but I
spent the money, on myself. He told
me about his scheme to blow up ships
lying at the piers of the Cunard and
French lines. I thought he was crazy
and decided to take his money."
Haller said Hudson proposed to him
within five minutes after they met to
blow up a Cunard steamsh,ip. He said
Hudson planned to cross the river
from Hoboken in a launch, climb
aboard the steamer carrying guns and
dynamite, and, when the steamer was
outside of Sandy Hook, hold up the
captain and crew and blow up the
ship, escaping In life boats.

"To the people of Iowa:
"I desire to call attention of the peo

the Federated Women's clubs of Iowa
to institute what may be known as
cleanup week, beginning April 24. Six
teen thousand women are behind this
movement. I hope the people of
this state will cooperate In every way
possible. The proposition has my un
qualified endorsement
"It would be helpful If the mayors
of the cities and the newspapers
would urge that meetings be held in
behalf of the movement and also if
the womeh of the state would see to
it that the purpose and value of the
movement are not lost in any com
munity."
BOYS PLAYING WITH KEG OF
POWDER HAVE FATAL ACCI
DENT SUNDAY.
Bonaparte, April 3 —One of the most
horrible accidents happened Sunday,
April 2 at the Nichols farm three miles
northwest of Bonaparte resulting In
the death of one boy and the serious
injury of two others.
The Bert Lazenby family were
spending the day with the Millard
Nichols family and just as they were
ready to sit down to dinner, a terrific
explosion occurred in a nearby shed
which blew one side of the building
out. On investigation it was found that
the two Nichols boys, August, aged 13,
Edward, aged 7 and Burns Lazenby,
aged 10 had set fire to a twenty-five
pound keg of powder causing the death
of August Nichol, who was standing
over the powder and seriously burning
the two other boys. The Nichols boy
was terribly burned, being hardly rec
cognizable and his eyes were entirely
out. The two other boys are still liv
ing with some hopes of their recovery.
Mr. Nichols was also badly burned
on both hands in trying to rescue the
boys. It Is thought that one hand will
have to be amputated.
The Nichols family had just moved
into the neighborhood and were hardly
settled yet.

the feasibility of a pl%n for eetaMMk^

children of the city.
Dr. W. C. Boone, representing
dentists, explained the pror
Statistics, he said, based on exhaustive

Infections, kidney troubles imi

all traceable to a greater or leaaar
gree to faults of the teeth.
The ill effects of bad teeth arc jm
confined to the physical side nlmti
either, said the doctor. It has been
oepted as a faet that children with
teeth, require six months mbre
to complete the eighth grade achc
oourse, than do the children wit
sound teeth. And moreover, thoae whe
are entirely free from dental troubles!
are very much in the minority for

have shown that ninety-eight per cent'f!
of the children had dental faults thati
should be corrected.
The First Dispensary,
Two brothers-in- Boston were the'
first to see that something Should be*
done to remedy conditions and belhl
wealthy, they established a mill!
dollar dispensary in Boston and ah|]
giving free service to all children whc|
will make use of it. Various cities li
the United States now have fr#e ':dU$
pensarles. Burlington is probably th
nearest city in this locality with a
dispensary and it is reported to be 'dc
Ing good service. The money for it
raised by subscription.
Having shown the need for a dl
pensary Dr. Boone then explained thl
proposition which has been made
the local dentists. Ten of them haVI
already promised to devote half a da)
a week in turn to the dispenatt
when it is established. Thfey will

they require are quarters for the d|l

It is the equipping of the dispensai
that Is receiving the attention of thl
joint committees. About $800 will""
needed for this purpose and the
ing of Sunday evening was to disc...
ways and means for raising t&ii
amount.
Confidence was expressed that
amount would be forthcoming
the desirability of the project
fully explained to those whom it
intended to solicit for the need*
money.
How It Will Work.
If the dispensary becomes a reality
it will provide a way whereby ever
child in the city can secure
dental service free of charge. Tb4
school nurse and other social
ers will be empowered to deali
the ones who
Beem
to be in need

ment, and at tlgat time the chlldz
will present themselves for examl

necessary.
The committees having the m&ttl
