Hospital Ship Sunk
Deliberately, Is Belief
Sp.-i Cable t. Th Wgaungton ierald.
Petrograd, Russia, April 2
(via London, April 3.)-There is
strong suspicion in official cir
cles in Russia that the sinking
in daylight of the hospital ship
Portugal was a deliberate act,
undertaken by a German ofi
cer for no other purpose than
to embitter Russia, and to ren
der Turkish defection impossi
ble.
The whole event takes spe
cial significance in the light of
recent news from Turkey,
where since the fall of Erze- I
rum the anti-German party has
been gaining ground rapidly.
The torpedoing of the ship
has caused a storm of indigna
tion throughout Russia. In the
streets, cafes, barracks, restau
rants, and the homes of rich
and poor alike, it is the subject
of conversation.

WESTERN PART OF VAUX
RETAKEN BY DEFENDERS
Crown Prince's Army Thrown Back

Wood in Fighting.
Speial Cable to The Washington Herald.
Paris, April &.-The battle for the
village of Vaux. a formidable obstacle in
the Crown Prince's drive against Verdun
east of the Meuse, is still raging
furiously, but when tonight settled upon
the battlefield it saw the French
victorious in a violent counter-attack, the
first one on a large scale thus far at
tempted, and the most successful counter
movement undertaken by the defenders
as regards results.
In fighting of the most savage
character, which Lasted all last night auid
throughout the day, the French counter
attack gained steadily until tonight they
had recaptured the western part of the
village, and, beside, thrown the Ger
mans back to the northern edge of the
Calliette wood, and to the pond north of
Vaux.
All of these positions had been firmly
held by the crown prince's infantry.
after the latest drive on this sector yes
tirday. and the two previous days. Thus,
a vital part of the two-mile gain made
ty the Germans was wrested from them
hv the French in the counter-attack.
The French war ofice in this after
noon's communique admitted that the
Germans yesterday succeeded in extend
ing their front over an area of this
length, adding that heavy losses were in
tlilted on the Teuton infantry columns
as they came forward in successive
wcves.
The gains netted by the French coun
ter-offensive not only reduces the Ger
man extension considerably, but also pre
sents a great menace to the whole Ger
man front in the Douaumont-Vaux sec
tor, if the spirit and the dash shown by
the French troops-evidently a surprise
to the Teutons-keeps up.

Ambassador Gerard, at Berlin, has

German foreign office still another case
where AtnerIcan lives have been jeopar

Eagle Point, torpedoed last Wednesday.
There was one American on board. Sec

Additional evidence has been received.
Very Important additional evidence has
been recived front survivors of the
Manchester Engineer, a British ship,
said to have been attacked without
warning by a German submarine. This
is to the effect that the periscope of the
attacking submarine actually was seen
by sur ivors who have made sworn
statements to be forwarded to the State
Department.
Secretary Lansing said yesterday that

Meanwhile the Cabinet today will
again consider the Sussex case but with
out Any indication of a change of policy
with regard to it in Berlin. Germany
twelve days after the Sussex was sunk
still maintains its stand that the Im
perial government is in no way re
sponsible.
It is stated on high authority today
that the United States government has
not decided what course it will pursue
even In case it is proved conclusively
that a German submarine attacked the
Sussex without warning. A week ago
It was stated authoritatively that the

District Attorney Believes the
Poisoner Was Blackmailed
After Crime.
AUTHOR OF TELEGRAM TO
PERCY S. PECK IS SOUGHT
Declared "K. Adams." Who Signed
Message, May Be Able to Shed
Ught on Tragedy Aftermath.
Specil to The W Hermi.
New York, Aprii 3.-The authorship of
the telegram Ahich suggested to the un
suspicious mind of Percy S. Peck, in
Grand Rapids. Mich., that his father.
John E. Peck, had been murdered in
the apartment of Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite, is apt to play a very important
part In District Attorney Swann's Inves
tigation.
The case against Dr. Waite himself is
complete. All that Is lacking In the
complete Inquiry is accurate information
as to the activities of persons who play
ed upon the poisoner's weaknesses and
fears-who took advantage of his panic
to mulct him.
"Within two days, we have reason to
believe, there will T, a confession touch
Ing on the authorship of the 'K. Adams'
telegram which arned Percy S. Peck.
and on a singularly cold-blooded black
mail plot, said Assistant District At
torney Mancuso today. "One of the
persons suspected has been warned that
we have very strong evidence against
him, and that he may save himself much
trouble if lie decides to tell the whole
truth."
The substance of District Attorney
Swann's information is that Waite was
so inapt as an amateur criminal that he
went to several persons within five days
of the death of his father-in-law, and
practically confessed that he was guilty
of murd'r. At the same time he re
vealed to them that he had money whleh
he was willing to spend to cover up the
indications of his crime. Judge Swann
Is acting on the theory that Waite was
blackmailed.
