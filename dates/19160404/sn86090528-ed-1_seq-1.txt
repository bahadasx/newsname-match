Th"se men, women and children are
divided Into two classes: the shabby

were driven from road acres and
lives of luxury by sentences of death
that today still await their return to

here and be poor.
Other hundred there are aboi't
fi.000 Mexican refugees here, were
fortunate enough to bring gold, with
them when thoy fled from the hand of
too much trouble. They live in great
style; and there are fashionable shops
and exclusive places to live here, that
are supported largely by thorn.
Most of these refugees, proud of
their pure Castlllian blood, new to
poverty and its humiliations, sensi
tive to thairty, will accept any em
ployment to keen from becoming pub
Jie. or private charges.
A copy, boy on one of tho local
American newspapers here, earning
$0.00 per week, was, until the (all of

family of Tamaulipas whose boast was
that their ranch was a day's horse

GASOLINE

Validity of New Ordinance to Ee Tested in
Sunshine Case; Coffman Agrees
to Await Decision of
Judge Linn
The matter of the fasoline tank iu
front of the Sunshine grocery, which
has been a bone of contention between
the management of that store and the
ity's department of justice, came to
the front this morning before the may
r iu an effort to test the legality of
the ordinance prohibiting inainte-
uce of gasoline storage receptacles
on certain portions and within certain
limits on Chickasha avenue.
Attorney Alger Melton was present
as representative for the defendant
ompany, with its representative,
Manager McGinley. The matter,
however, did not come to a trial, but
was passed by agreement between
Mr. Melton and Mayor Coffman until
such time as Judge Linn of the dis
trict court will return to Chickasha.
Judge Linn is holding court In Ana
darko this week and will possibly be
back in Chickasha during the last of
the week. Mayor Coffman stated, this
morning that immediately upon the
return of Judge Linn the matter
would be threshed out and said that
the city would be governed by the rul
ing of tho court.
The main point in tho controversy
will be whether or not the defendant
company, through its management,
can lawfully maintain a gasoline sup
ply station on Chickasha avenue, and
whether or not the ordinance iu ques
tion can operate against this campany.
The Sunshine company is alleged to
have put in the supply station some
weeks ago over the protest of certain
city officials. An old ordinance is on
tho city's statute books which pro
vides against the obstruction of the
sidewalks along the business streets
of the city. It was claimed at a re
cent meeting of the city council that
this ordinance had sufficient provis
ions embodied, in it to cover the case
in point, hut that its enforcement
might work a hardship upon a number
of Chickasha avenue business men
through compelling the removal of all
signs and other obstructions from the
sidewalks. In order that the installa
tion of gasoline supply stations might
be eliminated on Chickasha avenue
without affecting other matters, the
new ordinance was passed, which pro
vides that no such station may be
maintained at any point on Chickasha
avenue between First and Sixth
streets.
The management of tho Sunshine
Grocery company, it is alleged, will
claim that this ordinance is an ex post'
facto law and being such cannot bo
enforced.

BOY SCOUT
COMPANY
ORGANIZE
J. H. Mills Launches Movement Among
Lads; Not Military Organization but
School of Character; Motto is
"Do Good Turn Daily"
A company of the "Boy Scouts of
America" has been organized in
Chickasha, with Scout Master J. H.
Mills in charge and Rev. G. Lyle
Smith, M. H. Shepard, Jno. T. Meador
and B. P. Smith constituting the ini
tiative scout committee.
The scouts meet every Thursday af

tail hardware store. All boys between
the ages of 12 and IS are eligible to
membership.
Scout Master J. H. Mills has receiv
ed his recognition from Ihe Boy
Scnuts' headquarters in New York city,
and is spidly perfecting a permanent
organization in Chickasha.
In speaking of the Boy Scouts and
the organization of the Chickasha
boys, Mr. Mills said:
"Tho boy scout movement is not
antagonistic to any civic enterprise,
but rather seeks to co-operate with
all other good governments in the in
terests of American boys. The move
ment is wholly non-sectarian and
plans to work with every sect and
creed alike; it is non-military and
seeks to promote 'peace scouting' and
to develop educational character
building for good citizenship. It seeks
to make the boy a more useful and
appreciative son to his parents; a
more diligent and obedient student in
his school life; a more valuable aid"to
the community in promoting its ma
terial profess and protection.
"Among the prominent representa
tive men of this country who are mem
bers of the Boy Scout Council and who
give financial and moral aid to the or
ganization, are Woodrow Wilson, Wil
liam Howard Taft, William J. Bryan.
Theodore Roosevelt, with Daniel C.
Beard, National Scout Commissioner.
"The motto of the Boy Scouts is.
'Do a good turn daily.' Speak a good
word for them."
