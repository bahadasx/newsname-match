London, April 4. Fighting continu
ed all night in the Verdun regiou ea.st
of the Meuse, between Douaumont and
Vaux. The issue turned generally,
the war office announcement in Paris
of yesterday afternoon says, in favoi
of the French, who gained ground in
the northern part of Caillotte wood,
which was occupied by the Germans
Sunday. West of the river a bombard
ment was carried on near JIaumont,
without effect.
A dispatch from Paris at 5 a. m
says that a new phase of the battle
of Verdun has begun and the belie;
prevails that the violence of the
latest attacks foresliadaws another at
tempt by the Germans to rush the
fortress with vast forces. New bat
teries of large caliber have been
moved up closer to the French front
and the German infantry has been
rested and reorganized. Sunday's
fighting, on the whole, was not un
favorable to the French, it is au
inoruauveiy stated, me object ol
the Germans was to clear the ap
proaches to Fort Douaumont and 15,
000 men were thrown forward on the
1 1-2 mile line between Douaumont
fort and the village of Vaux. The at
tacking force succeeded in crossing s
little ravine which hitherto had
stopped them, and in entering the
Caillette wood.
The total result of the very for
midable effort they had put forth wat
a gain for the Germans of about 501
yards ' of terrain, more than offset it
Js affirmed, by the very heavy losses
they had endured. On the west of the
river the Germans attacked the Avo
court blockhouse in a no less deter
mined manner, but again met with
complete failure, the observers do
clare.
London, Tuesday, April 4. Ten per
Bons were killed and eleven injured in
Scotland in Sunday night s Zeppelin
raid, it Is officially announced. There
were no casualties in England.
The official statement, issued Mon

"It appears that altogether six Zep
pelins took part in the raids "of last
night. Three raided southeast count
ies of Scotland, one the northeast
coast of England and the remaining
two eastern counties of England.
"The vessels which raided Scotland
crossed the coast at 9 p. m., 9.43 p. m.
and 10.15 p. m., respectively, and
cruised over southeastern counties o!
Scotland until about 1.10 a. m. Their
courso gave no indication of any spec
ial locality for attack, but thirty-six ex
plosive and seventeen incendiary
bombs were dropped on various
places, damaging some hotels and
dwelling houses. Following are the
casualties which are reported at pres

Rumored Resignation of Premier
Stirs Business interests
PARLIAMENT FROBE IS PROBABLE
Sir Wilfred Laurier Declares Judicial
Inquiry Will Not Be
Acceptable.
Ottawa, Ontario, April 3. The story
was circulated today that Sir Robert
Horden was about to resign the Pre
miership. So seriously was this tak
en by the business interests of the
country that leading railway men and
bankers came to Ottawa to discover
if the rumor was true. This much may
he said, that the Prime Minister has
no such intention at present.
The leading men of both parties are
reticent regarding the situation, but it
is undoubted that considerable uneasi
ness exists in Cabinet circles. The
fierce indignation of the people from
coast to coast, as expressed in the
newspapers, is reflected here, and it
will take very radical action on the
part of the Government to make the
people believe that the Government
has been as careful of their interests
as it should have been. Three hun
dred thousand young men out of 8,
000,000 of a population, many of them
foreign and taking little or no interest
in the war, have enlisted for overseas
service, anil so the question of graft
on munitions goes home with a direct
ness that the usual political issue does
net.
The debate on the resolution to hold
an investigation into the operations of
the Shell Committee will be resumed
tomorrow evening. Sir Wilfrid Laur
ier demands a Parliamentary investi
gation declaring that the judicial in
quiry is "absolutely unacceptable." It
was during this debate that the Kyle
charges involving General Hughes,
Colonel J. Wesley Allison, B. F.
Yoakum, Eugene Ltgnanti, and others
were laid, and it is understood that
other perious allegations will be made
by the Opposition.
The debate is not expected to end un
til General Hughes arrives in Ottawa.
He was expected to sail on Saturday,
but a cable from London states that
he inspected the Canadian troops at
Shornelifle today. No official state
ment regarding his movements, how
ever, Is forthcoming. I tie tact tliat
he Is reported to be still in England
has aroused considerable indignation
both among the supporters of the Gov
ernment and the Opposition.
THE LITTLE PRINCESS
To Be Produced by the Tahkoneac
Camp Fire Girls on April 13-14.
Very few of us are ever afforded the

boys and girls to actually meet a little
princess on Thursuay evening, April
13th when Sura Crewe, the Little
Princess of Miss Minchins genteel
school will appear at Library hall
The Tahkoneac Camp Fire Girls, as
slsted by friends, have been working
on this play for several months and it
Is expected that the production will be
most, worth-while.
The play, with Frances Hodgson
Burncttas its author, has been played
by professionals, but is within the
range of the local amateurs, especially
under the capable coaching of Mrs. El
Hot, and is one of the favorities of the
Educational Dramatic league, Quite
a considerable royalty must be paid to
secure tho right of producing this play
and in view of this fact it is hoped that
the public patronage will bo liberal so
a to reward the efforts of the young
people beside lending support to one
of the most worthy of organizations,
the Camp Fire Girls.
Children under 14 years of ago will

According to Rumors That Come
From the Border
REPORTS' ARE CONTRADICTORY
Americans Following Bandits Said To
Have Been Misled by Mexican
Natives.
El Paso, Tex., April 4. Francisco
Villa, unwounded and accompanied by
only eight men, was at Satevo, 50
miles south of Chihuahua City, two
days ago, according to information re
ceived here yesterday from Mexican
sources which have proved unusually
reliable in the past. If this informa
tion is correct, it bears out previous
reports that the bandit chief is headed
toward Parral and is leading his
American pursuers by at least CO
miles. The nearest point to Satevo
which the American troops are known
to have reached is San Antonio, 60
miles to the northwest.
The route said to have been taken
by Villa Is one with which he is
thoroughly familiar and which, in
deed, is known among peons as "Pan
liio's road." From Guerrero It leads
across the continental divide through
the Bachiniba pass into a broad val
ley which runs cast to San Andres,
Villa's old headquarters, thence south
to Santa Ysahel, the scene of Villa's
massacre of 18 American mining men
and then southeast through Satevo to
Parral.
The man who carried the story of
Villa's arrival at Satevo to El Paso
gave a circumstantial account of the
baiidit s maneuvers and plan of cam
paign. While his story is impossi
ble of verification, his own credibil
ity is vouched for by reputable Amer
ican business men there who have
employed him for several years
"Villa." he said, "has never taken
part in any lighting with either Amer
ican" or Carrnnza troops
He left the
main body of his troops in the Guer
rero district with orders to oppose as
ar as they could the American ad
vance. At the same time tue peons
were instructed to glvo information
freely to American ofllcers always pro
vided that the information was false
'The story of Villa being wounded
was carefully concocted for the ex
press purpose of misleading Gen Per
shing and Col. Dod 1 into the belief
that the bandit was in hiding in the
mountains and thereby inducing them
to split their forces into small search
ing parties who would waste their
time in the wild Sierras while Villa
was making his way safely south
ward." This part of the Btory is glv
n color by the admission of Gen.
Pershing yesterday that his intelli

SOCONY KEROSENE
Reason Why It Is Better Than Ordin
ary Oils.
A sharp distinction is drawn be
tween ordinary kerosene and the
specially distilled product of the
Standard Oil Company of New York
iu the trademarked name socony
kerosene, 'l Here is prooabiy no
greater mistake than the belief which
still prevails in some quarters, that
all kerosene Is the same, when the
truth is, the grades differ as widely as
the grades of sugar or tea or coffee.
Infc-ior grades ol keroseene give
smoke and odor when used in the
lamp or in the oil stove. The distilla
tion process that produces Socony
kerosene gives a clear-burning pro
duct which has maxium efficiency In
lighting power nnd heat units. The
trademark, socony, is an assurance
that a gallon of that oil will give ser
vice down to the last drop, so perfect
is the uniformity. And the saving ef
fected by the use of kerosene as com
pared with coal Is a matter to be
borne in mind.

NO FIXED AMOUNT PROMISED
County Read Meeting in Progress
Here Today With Large Attend
ance Dinner at Putnam
State Highway Commissioner Stod
dard B. Bates of Derby arrived iu town
Monday afternoon for the annual
meeting of the Bennington county road
commissioners 'and selectmen which is
iu progress today. ' .
During the evening the commission
er met wft.V the members of the com-'
mittees frou: tho Bennington Board of
Trade and the Bennington County Im
provement asbotiation that have been
instrumental Is raising the subscrip
tion for the construction of a perman
ent highway over what is locally
known as the "West End" road. .
Tho commissioner was informed
that the town of Bennington had ap
propriated $2500 for this work and
that the committees had raised over
$3400. Mr. Bates expressed his : ap
preciation of the spirit shown by the
people of Bennington and assured tho
committeemen that his department
would add to the available funds what
ever could be consistently taken from
the state highway money. The com
missioner was averse to making any
figures at this time but he gave the
representatives of the two organiza
tions to understand that the state
would be as liberal In this instance as
it had been on similar occasions.
As was the case last year tho road
commissioners and selectmen encoun
tered an unfavorable day from the
standpoint of weather for their annual
meeting but there was a good atten
dance present, particularly from the
towns in the immediate vicinity when
tho commissioner rapped . for order
shortly after 10 o'clock. At the start
the commissioner gave the members V
of his class to understand that he,
should expect them to show improve
ment in their bookkeeping during the
year. I he state, he said was spending
a lot of money on the highways and
accurate accounting was necessary to
obtain the desired results. t: He im
pressed upon them the necessity of
giving special attention to the con
struction of foundations. The surface
problem, he said, has not yet been es
tablished but no road poorly built at
the bottom and insufficiently drained
would eventually be of any account for
any kind of surface. He advised that,
culverts be built a little larger and
that the advice of the engineers which
will be furnished at state expense be
sought in the construction of bridges.
What he desired to impress upon the
officials was that all highway construc
tion was for the benefit of the people
with whose money it was carried out
and that they should give the work
their best attention.
The following responded to the roll
call read by County Commissioner
Davis: J. W. Tyman of Arlington,
