NTT) THE EIRE
MISPLACED BOOZE RESULTS IN
THE LOSS BY OWNER OF HIS
WHOLE MONTH'S SUPPLY OF
FISH BAIT
In these days of barless towns and
a paucity of llquo. it's quite the
safest for recipients of a monthly two
qunit ration to carry the liquor with
them or In them. One man Is
doomed to spit cotton and suffer cob
webs to grow in his esophagus for
some littlo time unless kind friends
vlolato the law by rescuing him be
cause he failed to remember this.
This fellow was a victim of false
pride and misplaced liquor. A few
days ago he drew his legal two quarts
of splrltous liquor, but rather than
carry the clinking containers of
trouble or joy with him, he placed
them for safe keeping in the stove ot
a friend's office.
Next morning, recalling hU cache,
he made haste to get to the office lest
the office man discover tho bottles
and boat him to them. Upon reaching
the office, howevor, our hero was pos
itive tho frlond bad not made a Joy
ous discovery, for horrors) he was
applying a match to the trash in the
stove.
The strangled cry from O. H. and
the wild manner In which be sprang
Into the office, like a catamount some
what startled the office man. But the
explosion immediately afterwards, as
the bottles exploded, 4-c-a-r-e-d him
to auch an extent It took half a day to
convince him that his friend had not
gone crasy and taken two shots at
him.
But what of Our Hero? Suffice it
that be heartily agrees with what the
governor of North Carolina said to
the governor of South Carolina;
"It's a long tlsse between drlaks."

lScnldc Kecnriiig a Number of Add!
Clonal Water Rights and Faads for
Buying Some of These, Masob Re
ports that Tcntatire Contract Is Be
ing Considered by Government and
City Officials.
A report of progress on the Ankeny
canal closing ras rendered at last
night's council meeting by Mayor
Mason. This was referred to the An
keny canal committee of the council
for consideration.
The mayor's report follews:
Several months ago, at the sug
gestion of the mayor, you authorized
him to take up the matter, and If
possible find a way to get rid of that
nuisance which has been so long
troubling our city and which is known
the Ankeny canal.
In order to see that this was no'tne recent allied conference inspired
little tisk It is only necessary to men
tion the fact that the city has for the
last six or t even years been trying to
eliminate this unsightly menace to
the health of our community but
seemed unable to do so.
The first thing I did after enter
ing upon this work was to consult
many of those who had preceded me
In endeavoring to handle the case, in
order to profit by their experience.
I found them very willing to help, in
iny way tbey could In the matter.
Also I have to acknowledge the valu
able counsel and advice which was
unselfishly and cheerfully given me
by many ot our prominent attorneys
who had formerly had to do with the
case. Also that of our city attorney,
who haa rendered valuable assistance
all the way through.
The present status of the case Is
as follews:
The following rights have been con
veyed to the city absolutely, vis.:
E. R. Reames 5 rights
Alex Martin r2 rights
Geo. T. Baldwin 2 rights
Amanda Ha maker 2 rights
E. E. Wise 1 righti
Fred Schallock 1 right
C. R. DeLap . .V 1 right
Chas. l. Roberts 1 right
ChaB. L. Parrlsh 1 right
John Irwin 1 right
J. M. Evans 1 right
E. V. Coggswell V right
These people were all willing to
convey their ngntsto tne city tree
of charge In order to get rid of the
old ditch. These eighteen rights have
cost (ho city nothing except 18.60
paid for notary fees where the grant
ors lived at a distance. Notaries in
Klamath Falls charged nothing.
One right Is now in escrow to be
turned over to the city when the suc
cess of the enterprise is assured.
There are two rights which belong
to estates which have been settled
and the rights were not included in
the Inventory and have not been used
for many years, and we have been
assured will not cost tbe city any
thing. The prices on eleven of the remlan-
Ing rights have been agreed on and
there have been some donations from
a few citlsena to help pay for them.
After deducting the amount so donat
ed there remains $600 for the city
to pay. This will leave four rights
for whtch we have been unable so
far to negotiate In a satisfactory man
ner; but we are hopiug that later on
we may be able to do so.
As a part of thia report I desire
to BUbmtt a letter from X). 8. Taylor
of Portland, Oregon, district counsel
for the reclamation service; asd also
a contract whtch is the outgrowth
ot a lengthy, earnest and somewhat
vigorous conference between Mr.
Taylor. J. O. Camp, City Attorney
Groesbeck and the mayor. This eon
tract seems to be the Tery best tor
