lines of general welfare work and
discussed his views as to the estab

torium throughout the State He
said the work thus far done in Ken
tucky had proved that County tuber

cal, for the reason that the cost was
found to be too great for their estab
lishment and maintenance.. His plan
contemplates the ultimate establish
i - ment of nine tuberculosis sanitorium
districts in Kentucky, each composed
of a number of Counties. District
fa which Hopkins is situated would
bi'kndwn. as second,, district tands-as
proposed would contain fourteen
counties running from the Ohio river
South to 'the-Tennessee line. The

ic' Hopkins County organization

complished. He addressed a small
audience at the Christian church Fri-
day evening upon the question of
.health and the eradication of prevent
able diseases During his lecture he

Rah! for the league.
We are sorry to loose two good

prove a gain to Howell, and we ex

the eighth and ninth grades and we
are sure their smiling faces will of

Hoptown Ball Game
The ball players of this place
played the Hopkinsville High
school team at.the ball grounds
in Hopkinsville last Saturday,
It was formerly intended that
the game be played on the 1(0 mo
diamond and before a crowd of
Earlington rooters, but it was
decided that the ground was en
tirely too muddy.
Our players did some excellent
work against the superior Hop
town team, and gave evidence
of first class pep for the coming
season. Though defeated in
this game, the boys firmly be
lieve, that in the return game at
this place April 22, they will lit
eracy "mop up" with the crazy

Jack Davisjs Burieff
Tho last rites of the churclh
were performed over the remains
of little Jack Davis yesterday
afternoon, the funeral service be-.
ing read at the home and tho
committal at the grave. Key.
0. R. D. Orittentou, archdeacon
of tho diocese of Dallas, Episco
pal, in charge, Following a beau
tiful hymn, "On Tho Resurrec
tion Morning," feelingly read by
tho archdeacon, the Episcopal
choir sang the hymn, "Jesus,
Tender Shepherd, HearMo ;Blesa
Thy Little Lamb Tonight."
Then followed tho words of tho
burial service, rich in the blessed
certainty that all is well with
those who have passed to'a Fath
er's arms. Sweetly consolatory
that Christ is the resurrection
and the life and that thoso
Whom the kind Father has lent
to us for a. season nn who haye-
been calledj'on, will rneet ns
when we," too, have crossed the,
river.
The chtoir sang as the second
hymn, "There's a Friend for
Little Children, Above the
Bright Blue Sky," after which
friends lookedjjforithe last time
on the sweet face of the little
one who was the subject of the
prayers that are used by the
church over prince and panper,
the venerabledeador the youngr
child. He looked beautiful in
death, as lovely,jindeed, as the
blossoms that bedecked the caa-
ket. It would have been easy tS
imagine mat no was asleep, ex
cept that indefinable ; dignity
which comes Iwith death had
been stamped on his" features.
It is easy loJimagi.ne)ltliat wheri
the Angel of the Lord calietlj
JacK stretched ,oat .his hands
smilingly responded,
A great concourse attended
the committal"at Jtho cemetery
includingCompanyI, of which
the bereaved father is captain.
As the notes of j thejjbuglo diect
away, the priest tookup the re
frain, "Man, thatis born of wo
man, hath but aj short time fa
live, and is full of misery. He
cometh up, andjis'cut down, like
a flower; be neethjjas it were a
shadow, and never coutinueth in
0ne stay."
"1 heard voice from Heaven,
saying unto me, 'Write,, from
henceforth blessed are the dead
who die in the Lord ; even so,
saith the spirit; for they rest
from their labors.';"
After the blessing, the soldier
boys, who had loved the merry
hearted little lad by whose grave
they were now standing, gently
covered the remains with earth
and then marched away to take
up once more the problems that
beset each one of them here on
earth.
The little comrade is gone and
the hearts of thefparents are torn
with emotion, But, through the
rift of the clouds that may seem
to hide -the face of God, there
comes the appaal of a little face
beckoning them on aud on, to
where he is : with God.
"And a little child shall lead
them."
