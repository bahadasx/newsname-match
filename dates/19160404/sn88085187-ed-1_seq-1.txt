F. 11. Pettit and Owen Woods
were today conceded places on the
final municipal election ballots by
Mayor Fawcett and two city com

Of 'Za other well informed per

Pettit a place In their selection of

In prophesying the outcome of
today's primary, the city officials
all were positive that they could
name the three high men in the
race for councilman, but were all
doubtful over the fourth.
Mayor Fawcett said he believed
Pettit, Woods, Stayton and Mc
