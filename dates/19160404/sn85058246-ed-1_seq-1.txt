EVANGELIST
PREACHES TO
CONGREGATION
An appreciative audtonco heard
Evangelist M. A. Holllster last Sun
day evening at the Seventy Day Ad
ventlst Church give nn Interesting
biblical solution of tho European war
or Eastern Question.
The subject was prepared with re
marks illustrated with pictures, show
ing excavations, and' tablets dug from
them, such as the famous Rosetta
Btone, tho key to tho inscriptions
found upon tho walls, and tablets,
these ho said wero a fulfillment of
tho prophecy that knowlcdgo should
be Increased In the last days and
were to confirm our faith in tho bible.
Many of these tablets, have proven
the contentions of men false, and
have strengthened the facts of pro
phecy as given in tho blblo.
Thus showing wo could bellovo the
word of God, the Evangelist rend from
Daniel's prophecy the eleventh chap
ter, where the first few verses glvo
a history of the downfall of tho Modi
Persian kingdom, tho Grecian and its
division Into four parts, their intri
gues, etc. Tho famous Roman king
dom and down to tho 36-39 versos
where the French Revolution is por
trayed ond then from verses 40 and
45 tho Turkish power, tho last two
verses of this chapter, and tho first
two of tho next, contain tlio startling
Information that tho Turkish Empire
must romova it's seat of government
from Constantinople to JorusaleM,
then follows a war greater and moro
terrible than the ono now bding wag
ed in Europe, and which causes tho
complete downfall of tho Turkish
power, and not alono that, but all
tho powers of tho world. Then Imme.
dlately follows tho next great events
or tho second coming of Christ, tho
resurrection of tho dead, and tho de
liverance of God's, people.
Tho subject tonight Is 'tho Gospel
of tho Kingdom, what Is It?

VIENNA LOOKS FOR A
BIG FIGHT MOVE IN THE
MONTH OF MAY
Vienna, April 1. Military authori
ties hero aro not Inclined to believe
that thu nggrosslvo operations; that
cither sldo wilt undertake, possibly
In May, will result Immediately In
a debacle of arms in any quartor.
Talk of that nature is characteris
ed as idle.
At tho samo tlmo It is felt that
tho outcomo of tho offensives timed
for that porlod will havo far reach
ing effect, and that tho central pow
era aro preparing with ovory ounce
ot energy for the great battles draw
ing close.
Tho vigor with which tho campaign
In tho Balkans has been pushed is
ono indication that nothing Is loft
undone so ns to bo rendy when tho
moment comes.
Tho cnlllng to tho colors In Austria
Hungary ot nil men between tho ngo
of CO nnd 55, for service In the rea-,
Is another.
Meanwhile tho inn,nufucturo of tho
urras and amnfunltlon continues at
a paco greater than ever boforo.
Considering that during tho winter
relatively llttlo ammunition has been
UBcd, tho stores of this kind must
bo tremendous.
It Is known at any rate that the
central powers havo enough ammuni
tion to meet any situation without
fear of running short.
This applies also to Bulgaria and
Turkey. In both tlioso countries now
lovles of recruits havo been mado
and nro being armed and trained.
Whether tho central powers will
wait for tho Entento offensives or
themsolves tako tho initiative Is, of
course the grcntest military secret
of Europo nt tho present.
