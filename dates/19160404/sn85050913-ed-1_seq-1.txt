Preparing for a Successful Campaign
—Methods Employed by Dr.
Henry W. Bromley.
CO-OPERATION OF CHURCHES.
?h
A Big Tabernacle Will be Erected—
Site Has Not Been Chosen
By Committee. -t
As announced in Saturday's dally,
Evangelist Henry W. Bromley and
bis party have accepted the call ex
tended by a' number of our churches
to lead in a union evangelistic cam
paign to be held during next fall.
The local executive committee "was
organized some time ago by electing
John L. Peterson chairman, and S.
6. Parkhiir^t secretary. At a late
meeting it was decided to extend the
call and the chairman and secretary
were authorized to complete the pre
liminary arrangements with Dr.
Bromley. Mr. Peterson went to Sac
City Friday^ where the Bromley par
ty are just
rclosing
w:"
a successful cam­
paign, and had a conference with
Mr. Brbmley. Late that night t!io
contract—if it may be so termed—
was signed and in substance it con
tains a call to the evangelist and Ills
party to conduct/-a union tabernacle
campaign in this city to begin on or
about November 12, 1916—extend
ing five weeks, The ministers, of
flcial^S ^and^^other members, of
cjiurches agree to rally enthysias-t
tically to the support of the catri
BWJ^^iuaii.in^b^ Jaatter.of previous,
preparation and subsequent conser
vation, as well aa in tMe wor^.ot the
campaign proper. The evangelist is
td be allowed perfect freedom—for
himself and party—as to message
and method.' It is a forgone conclu
sion that they can do their work
best in their own way—learned by
years of experience—as it fs impos
sible for "David to
UBO
Saul's arm-
or."
The Bromley evangelistic party is
an exceptionally strong organiza
tion. Some of the party have been
with Dr. Bromley for a number of
yearj. Actual team work is done
which has telling effect upon the
community, and under their leader
ship—with Ood's blessing and care
ful and prayerful preparation—
Webster City, it is hoped, will have
a meeting which will bring results
never before known to this city.
'Strong as the party is, much will
depend upon the churches. From now
on it is important that united effort
be put forth in the preliminary cam
paign which will be directed by the
evangelist. Much importance will be*
placed upon the matter of prayer and
careful preparation as "more things
are wrought by prayer than tills
*7
A'Si-
-i
7V
world dreams of."
Something of the party in gener
al: Dr. Bromley is a strong and
scholarly -preacher, having three
university degrees. Is fearless in
his presentation of the truth as he
sees it, full of evangelistic fervor,but
is kind and considerate, possessing
the qualities of a true,' cultured
Christian gentleman. He has been
in the evangelistic field for some
twenty years with marked success.
rs. Bromley is One of the great
est aids to Mr. Bromley in his work,
both encouraging him and assisting
him in~ every way possible and also
doing invaluable personal work in
the meetings. She is tireless in her
energies in. the campaigns and is a
big factor in making for the greatest
possible success. Mrs. Bromley rap
idly makes friends and has charge of
the Women's Department.
Rev. E. D. Fellers, associate evan
gelist, is the right man in the rigfyt
place. A pastor and evangelist be
fore *|oining the Bromley party, he
has had experience which gives him
a peculiar fitness for his present
work. His work with men is strong
and he appeals especially to the lab
oring class.
Professor William H. Myers is the
musical director and soloist. He has
the musical education aqd native
ability that are necessary, and gains
the friendship of the choir and con
gregation. He is a hard worker,
does much persona) work, and as
sists in other lines.
D. L. Anderson is, private secre
tary of Dr. Bromley andjs in charge
of the young men's work in the *am*
paigns that are conducted by Dr,
Bromley, .He .ntakes' friends cii the
Voting imeiT'ih ttfe^Community and ac
complishes 'great work among them.
He is a live wire.
Miss Florence Haupert, piano
specialist^ and In charge of the
Young Women's Work, comes from
Moody Bible Institute/ or has spent
time there in preparation.
Rev. William E. Parrish—pres
ent advance agent and general or
ganizer—was 'for a number Of years
connected with rescue and charita
ble work in Washington, D. C. He
has also been In the ministry for a
number Of years, held several good^
appointments and ji^s had Consider
able experience in Y. M. C. A. work
and newspaper work also.
\A new feature of work to be tak
en upf by Dr. Bromley is that of an
advance' worker. ""He comes rfn the
field about a month before the meet
ings are to begin and assists in the
organization of the local church
forces. This by way of prayer meet
ing organizations, a religious cen
sus of the city and any other prelim
inary work which may be outlined.
The pronfoterB of the meetings
feel surb Webster ICty will unite to
make this campaign the greatest
event in the history of,.the city this

CM SECURE Ira
EDO HA1F HOUR TALK
Will Cost Just $100—Committee to
M^ke Decision This'
Evening.-'
Rev. C. H. Kamphoefner yester
day received a letter from the Busi
ness Mens Temperance Association
of Jowa, offering W. J. Bryan as a
temperance and suffrage speaker for
this city on May 10th. The silver
tongued orator would only be able
to give a half hour's address here,
before leaving for Fort Dodge. For
this half hour, the Temperance As
sociation asks |100, a price which is
considered stiff enough.
Bryan is donating five days of his
time for the cause of these two
movements in this state and gets
only his actual traveling expenses,
which, of course, include a special
car, etc. The money received for his
addresses goes to the temperance
movement in the state.
A meeting will be held this
evening to decide the question for
this city, whether or. not it would
pay financially to have tlie Ex-Seere
iary of State here to speak for only
half hour. The decision of the
committee, however, will be an
nounced as soon as made.
Increased Pension.
James Kephart has just received
news from Washington that his pen
sion ha8/ been increased to ?40 per
month. Served him right. Mr. Kep
hart has a fine record as a soldier
and this forty dollars a month will
come handy to him in his declining
years.
THE
1
year. It is sure to touch every
phase of community life and is wor
thy of our best and united endeav
ors, Not only will ^he Immediate
tyy receive an inspiration but the
surrounding vbuntry 4nd smaller
towns in Hamilton and nearby coun
ties are invited to look forward to
the meetings. All are invited to at
tend and lend their co-operation to
make' the campaign a great success.
The committee will have much
work to do. -A tabernacle of good
size and seating capacity will be
erected. No site has as yet been se
cured. but will be announced when
decided upon. From time to time
further announcement of plans will
be made.
The Bromley party open their fall
campaign at Bay City, Michigan,
about the middle of September and
will come to Webster City soon af
ter tho close of that meetftig.

Former Resident of This City—Be­
lieved That He Will Recover
From Wound.
A telephone message was received
in this i^ity Sunday night from the
authorities, of small town about
forty-two miles west of Omaha,
Neb., stating that Jesse Knight, a
former resident of this city, had
been in trouble of some sort and had
attei&pted suicide by cutting his
throat with a razor. The attempt
was unsuccessful and the younijf
man is now in a hospital of the
place, recovering from the effects of
his act.
Mr. Knight had been visiting in
this city about two weeks ago and
had gone to Nebraska, presumably to
take some kind of a position. Few
details of the affair are knqwn be
yond the fact that while seriously
injured, he is expected to recover.
Two members of the family lpft yes
terday for his bedside. The Voung
man is a son of Mrs. J. E. Knight
who resides on south Superior street
and who during the past foujf years
has lost her liusband, a son fend a
daughter. The sympathies of the
community are aroused for this
woman whio. it seems, has had more
than her share of trouble.
Frisky as a Colt.
Emll Beck's new Chevrolet car Is
not only a peach but is as frisky ate
a young colt. Emil had it out Thurs
day, breaking It to drive to harness
and after it had become used to all
the dazzling sights of the city with
out running away, the driver turned
to go into his garage. (Whether some
thing frightened it or not or wheth
er it was tired and 'overly anxious
for a rest, our informant saith not.
Anyhow, it 'suddenly took' a spurt
and rammed its nose in the wall of
the garage. However, further than
breaking Its "specks," no damage
was done.
New Superintendent.
Ellsworth News: The school
board announces that they have se
cured R. E. Simpson of Cylinder.

for the school year 1916-17. i*
Mr. Simpson comes well recom
mended and the schoot board feel as
though they have choeen the proper
man.
There were close to forty appli
cations for the position, out of which
six or Seven made personal applica
tion.

ANOTHER BIG DEAL TAKES
PLACE IN WEBSTER
C. C. Janney of Waterloo Purchases
The Willson Hotel—The
Consideration Is
$60,000.
$90,000 IN IMPROVEMENTS.
Webster City Will Have One of the
Finest Hostelries in State
of Iowa.
The Willson hotel was sold Fri
day by W. N. Merrill and R. T. Har
vey, joint owners, to C. C. Janney,
a prominent Waterloo hotel man.
Mr. Janney owns a hotel at Cedar
Falls, also being indirectly interested
in several other Iowa hostelries. It
is understood that ,the consideration
was $60,000. Possession will be
given by Mr. Merrill about April
25th and by Landlord Harvey May
1st.
The part, however, which will be
of most interest to Webster City
people is the fact that Mr. Janney
intends to at once begin the work of
remodelling and making over the
hotel, which was built in 1869 and
since that time has been remodelled
perhaps twice, the brick structure
proper, being built and opened about
thirty years 'ago this spring.
W. C. and S. Willson built the
first Willson hotel, a small frame
building In 1869 and the time hon
ored fight between uptown ana
down town was on,- never^ t» b^ en
tirely forgotten.
W. J. Zltterell of this city has the
plans for remodelling the hotel. and
they are very extensive. $90,000
will be expended for improving and
making over the old building until
swallowed up in a new front and so
many other improvements that it
will be an entirely new hotel. The
name will bq changed and it will
henceforth be known as Hotel Web
ster to traveling men and the gener
al public.
The walls of the hotel will be ex
tended even with the sidewalk on
the east and north, the exterior to
be of pressed brick to match the
front of the annex occupied by the
W. B. Kearns cigaFstore and billiard
rooms. Bxcavations under the hos
telry will be much deeper than at
present, and this space will be occu
pied by the Kearns cigar store and
billiard rooms and the Maag & Clif
ton barber shop. There will be
room for three store
frontB
i&ii- iir'tftfty
on the
east and the level of the first floor
will bfe considerably nearer the stde
walk level. The office will extend
back as far as th$ present kitchen
of the hotel with sample rooms
where the kitchen now is.
The dining room will be on the
south, where the present court back
of the annex is located and will all
be under glass roof, making a de- Lovelace.
