SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 3.
The fear expressed yesterday at
army headquarters that Francisco
Villa had escaped from tho region
In which General Pershing's cavalry
columns are operating, became a con
vict lin by the close of the day. No
report from Mexico stated that hu
had disappeared but all Information
secured indicated that ho was gone.
General Pershing's report, received
after noon, contained the news that
at least a part of the dispersed Villa
force that was driven from Guerrero,
March 29. still were moving in the
district northeast of that place but
no mention of Villa's whereabouts
was made. Ills report was dated yes-
teiday. Six columns of cavalry were
yet riding the hills und plains in that
section while scouts were endeavoring
to pick up the trail of the scattered
bands as well as that of their fugitive
chief. One force of Villa's men, es
timated at one hundred, commandea
by Colonel Hellrun, was located near
Uaclneva, about 25 miles northeast
uX Guerrero, and information was
gathered that lndicnted tho remainder
of the four or five hundred were still
In that region. No reference was
made in that report of an encounter
that was mentioned in press dispatch
es from the front.
tiuides I'lircllablc.
Information gathered from various
sources and confirmed by General
Pershing Indicated that the Intelli
gence officers of the punitive force
were having to contend with difficul
ties created by tho receipt of misin
formation liberally supplied in dis
tricts through which Villa or his fol
lowers had passed. General Pershing
also reported that he hud difficulty
in securing reliable guides.
His statement that it had been re
ported to him that Colonel Cnno had
engaged a .Villa force in a fight on
tho same day that the American
were driving the bandits from Guer
rero, served to allay somewhat the
fear that had arisen here that Cano
had revolted, a report that appeared
well founded.
Pcrsliing PiiyJod.
Which way Villa hus gone is now
largely a question for General Per
shing's scouts to answer. it war
pointed' out at Gcnerat Houston's
luudquiiteis that once the trail was
picked out the troop. would resume
thu chase further Into the interior, al
though it was realized that this sec
ond phase of tho punitive expedition's
work will be far more difficult than
was the first. It is not Improbable, it
was said, that more troops than thoso
already in Mexico will bo required.
The topoginphy of tho country south
of Guerrero Is such that siicces-dul
pursuit can bo conducted only by a
wide deploying of forces nnd the utili
zation ol a large part of the Infan
try. It was pointed out that tho fur
ther tho troops penetrate Into Mexico
the greater will be tho necessity for
strengthening the lines of communi
cation. From the bonier to tho ex
treme southern portions the advanced
posts alrcudy have traveled three
hundred milts when there is taken
into account tho twistings of the
trails they have traveled.
Nerd More (Supplies.
The Northwestern railroad is not
yet being used, due partly, it, was un
officially reported here, to a fuilure
of General Gavira and General Hell
to reach an agreement. The timely
placing in service of more motor
triw ks allevluted temporarily the sup
ply situation, however, and General
I'crshinif reported today that motor
trucks now are delivering supplies to
a point south of Namaqulpa, almost
two hundred miles In tho border.
General Pershing also reported that
he had found grain of an Inferior
grade for the horses and mules but
grass Is scarce und the need for hay
Ij pressing. The aeroplanes are being
used for communication between Co
Ionia Dublun and the front and that
means soon will be supplemented by
a wagon wireless set that has been
sent forward to one of the advanced
bases.

DELIBERATE ATTACK
ON HOSPITAL SHIP

Been Implicated.
Washington; April 3. An ac
count of the torpedoing of the
Kraneo-Russlnn hospital ship Portu
gal in tho P.htck sea March 30, wilh
the loss of many lives, including
those of lied Cross officials and sis
ters of charity, was cabled from Pet

of an Austrian craft.
Following is the dispatch to the

tne Portugal, but the second struck
her amidships, the boilers exploding
and the ship breaking in two and
sinking in one minute and a half.
"The persons aboard, consisting of
the permanent ship's staff and a de

UNWOUNDED, VILLA
MANY MILES AWAY
Headed Toward Parral With
Only Few Trusted Mvn
With Him.
ON "PANCHO'S ROAD"
Cavalrv Will Have to Travel
Rapidly to Overtake
Bandit.
E
U PASO, April 3. Francisco Villa.
unwoiinded and accompanied by
only eight men, was ut Salevo, fifty
miles south of Chihuahua City, two
days ago, uccording to Information re
ceived here toiltiy from Mexicans
sources, which usuully have been
proven reliable in the past.
II this information is correct It
bears out previous reports that the
bandit chli f is headed toward I'urral
and is leading his American pursuers
by ut least sixty miles. The nearest
point to Salevo which tho American
troops ure known to have reached is
.San Antonio, sixty miles to the north-
est.
The route said to have been taken
by Villa is one with which he is thor
oughly lamlliar and which indeed is
known among the peons us "Paneho's
road." From Guerrero It lends across
the continental divide through tho
liuchinlba pass Into a broad valley
which runs east to San Andres, Villa's
old lieadquu iters, thence south to
Santa Ysabcl, the scene of Villa's
massacre ol IS American mining men,
and then southeast through Sulevo to
Pa ri al.
Separates l ioai Army.
The man who-brought the story of
Villa's arrival at Salevo here gave a
circumstantial account of the bandit's
maneuvers and plan of campaign.
While his story is impossible of verifi
cation, bis own credibility is vouched
for by reputable Americans, business
men here, who have employed him
lor several cars.
"Villa," be said, "has never taken
part III any lighting with either
American or ( 'art an.a troops. He
lit I the main lioly ol his troops in the
Guerrero district with orders to op-;
pose as far as they could the Ameri
can advance. At the same time the
peons were instrtieied to give infor
mation Ireelv to American dliecrs,
ulwajs provided that the information
was lalse. The story ol Villa being'
wounded was carefully concocted for
the express purpose of misleading
General Pershing and Colonel Dodd
into the belief that the bandit was in
biding in the mountains and thereby
inducing them to split their for 'es
into small searching parlies who
would waste their time 111 the wild
Sierras while ilia was making hit
way salely southwur."
Mi-lenoiim Informal Ion.
This pan ot the story is given color
by the admission of General Pershing
today that hit: intelligence department
has been given much misleading In
formation and that it was becoming
more difficult to secure reitaolo
guards.
Continuing his story, the man said:
"The American officers were foiled
at first, but they have a fair knowl
edge of the real situation now and
the advance column is driving south
east with all the speed they can com
mand. Their only chance of catch
ing up' with Villa Is that they have a
good road and should not lie handi
capped by tho big problem of forage
and water. The trail fiom'San An
tonio to Satovo leads through a broad
valley where there is generally plenty
of water at this time of the year mid
which Is fairly fertile and well culti
vated. Of course the peon farmers
will try to conceal their grain, hut
American gold and silver will be a
temptation many of them will bo un
able to resist, .
"If they can catch up with Villa he
fore he ifets into the Torreon district
they ought to be ablo to kill or cap
ture him, but if he Is able to join
forces with Canuto Reyes they will
have a difficult tusk ahead of them."

PRICE FIVE CENTS
HOUSE BRINGS
TO END HEARING
ON NAVAL BILL
Subcommittee Will Begin
Framing of Measure
Immediately.
DANIELS ATTACKED
And Then He Replies to
Numerous Charges Made
Against Him.
WASHINGTON. April S. The
house naval committee brought
to an end today its prolonged hearing
on tho 1917 naval appropriation bill.
Secretary Daniels closed a three-day
statement before tho committee with
a final appeal in support of the ad
ministration's five-year building pro
gram. A subcommittee will begin
framing the bill immediately.
It became known tonight that a
determined effort would be mado to
provide for six capital ships, two
dreudnaughts und lour buttle cruisers
us a compromise between tho rec
ommendations of the secretary und
of tho navy general Hoard.
Mr. Daniels parried till efforts to
day to get from him a statement as
to what relative place among naval
powers the United Slates should oc
cupy, lie wild the five-year pro
gram he hud mapped out would not
put the country in second place, In
his judgment, und that tho present
congress Could not be usked to make
up for the deficiencies of twenty
years past. At the close of the Kuro
pean war, ho said, he believed a
great opportunity would come for
international limitation of armament
und wilh u strong building program
adopted tho United States would be
in a better position to urge that
movement more successfully thun if
its fleet were weak.
Divulging Secrets.
Rcpresentutlvo Duller of Pennsyl
vania, Republican, assailed tho secre
tary's recommendations for a govern
ment projectile factory. He asserted
that tho specifications for navy armor
piercing shells were so high that they
could not be met by manufacturers
und ulso declared that he had reuson
to believe that the specifications for
navy 14-inch guns and other muterlul
had been revealed during Mr. Dan
iels' administration to the Russian
and German governments. He sug
gested that Hear Admiral Strauss,
chief of ordnance, be asked to pro
duce a letter to the Krupp company
of Germnay.
Admiral Strauss was summoned lat
er and read the l-'tter In question. It
was a reply to an offer mado before
the war by the Krupp company to
supply 14-inch guns for the United
Slates navy. 1 he ordnance bureau
answered that If guns to meet the re
quirements outlined in the offer could
he provided the company's bid would
have attention,
"These are not the specifications of
our H-lnch gun." Admiral Strauss
said. "They aro for a much superior
gun."
Iloth the secretary and the admiral
said they had no knowledge of any
Plans or other Information having
been Imparted to the Itussian govern
ment. lie Answers ( barges.
In answer to Peprcsciilative I'.ut
ler's assertion that the armor piercing
shell specifications were too high.
Admiral Struuss produced the records
of the department to show that tho
.Vtdvule and Crucible Steel companies
had delivered large quantities of
shells that had passed the tests.
Secretary Daniels leplied at length
to criticisms of himself implied or
staled during the testimony of Rear
Admiral 1'iske, loimcr aide for oper
ations, and became Involved in a
warm controversy witli Representa
tive I'.rittcn ot Illinois, Republican.
Responding to questions by Chairman
Padgett, he said Admiral liske alio
sought appointment as communder of
the Atlantic fleet when Hear Admiral
liudger lelircil and nnd repeatedly re
quested it, to the secretary's great
embarrassment. Mr. Daniels said he
told Admiial Uiske that I tear Admiral
Fletcher, then commanding a squad
ron in Mexican waters seemed entitled
to tho appointment. Admira.' Kisko
replied that Fletcher did not want it.
the secretary said, and asked that tho
appointment be held up until bo could
write to Fletcher. This was done, Mr.
Daniels said, and when Fletcher re
plied that he would be honored by
the command he was appointed and
from that lime on Admiral Fiskc was
not in harmony with the navy depart
ment. "Our first difference," .said tho sec
retary, "was over the wine mess ordc.
Admiral Fiske was greatly aggrieved,
lie said navy officers would go to
using cocaine. My only regret about
the order is that I did not issue it on
March 5 when 1 came Into office, in
tdeud of waiting."
