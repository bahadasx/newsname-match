The program of Governor Pink
liatn and party ns thus far formu
lated, and when boiled down, is
as follows:
The Governor, Suberintendent
Chas R. Forbes, Laud Commission
er Rivenbitrgh, Superintendent of
Forestry Judd and Major James
D. Dougherty, Aide-de Camp,
will r.rrive in the steamer Maui at
Nawiliwili next Friday morning.
The party will proceed immedi
ately overland to Waiinea where
they will breakfast at the Waimea

specting the improvements around
Waimea and looking into certain
matters at Kekaha. Saturday morn
ing certain matters near Koloa

There, may be a meeting in Li
hue Saturday night, at the Social
Hall; although just what the fea
tures will be and how many and

now known. This information will
be sent out in the Daily Wireless
as soon as possible.
The Kapaa and Waipouli home
steaders have been invited to meet
the Governor and party at the
drill shed in Kealia at 10 A. M.
next Monday. It is understood
that there will be no speech-making
nor formal meeting, but the
CVovernor will interview each home
nteader personally (privately if
that may seem best) on conditions
at Waipouli and the homesteader's
own ideas as to what should be
done to better conditions.
The party will likelv return to
Honolulu Tuesday evening, al
though the Governor has announc
ed it as his purpose to stay here
until the homesteading and water
questions of this island are settled
once and for all.
The original plans of the Gov
ernor included spending Friday
night at the McBryde place, at
Kalaheo; Saturday night as the
guest of a Lihue citizen and Sun
day night with Colonel Spalding,
at Kealia. About noon Monday
the Governor sent wirelesses to
these three parties, informing them
that no courtesies could be accept
ed by the Governor's party while
on Kauai. The messages were in
quite polite terms and assured the
recipients that no discourtesy w.is
intended At the same time an
other wireless came through which
engaged rooms and accommoda
tions at the Fairview Hotel, Lihue,
for the entire official crowd.
While nothing is known definite
ly about it, the assnmpti' n on
Kauai is that the co incidence of a
write-up on the Waipouli-Kapaa
homesteading proposition appear
ing in the Advertiser at Honolulu
the same morning caused the
Governor to change his plans.
This write-up, it may be explain
ed, was by a reporter of the Adver
tiser who made a tour of the island
last week.

Company of Hawaii, who has been
in Lihue several days checking

morning to pursue formal investi
gations, but it is now reported
that only Mr. Forbes may come.

Senate without change. It is the
general belief that the bill will
pass the Senate with possibly not
more than ten or twelve dissenting
votes, and if the Hardwick substi
tute should come to a vote in the
Senate, it will not receive more
than the number of votes cast
against the bill reported by the
committee.

"Under the provisions of the by
laws of the Chamber of Commerce
of Honolulu, the Hawaii Promo
tion Committee, which is a stand
ing committee of the Chamber of
Comineiceof Honolulu, is required
to make at least one visit ntr year
to each of the outer Islands. We
have already made our business
visits to Maui and Hawaii, where
the Promotion Committee was giv
en every opportunity by the Com
mercial organizations and public
ity bureaux to see for themselves
what the islands possessed in the
wav of tourist attractions, and
they absoibed considerable amount
of information .by the personal
visit.
"Our.oommittee is figuriim on
the latter part of April or the first
part of May for their official visit
to the Island of Kauai, but as
Kauai has no representative on
the Promotion Committee at the
present time, we arc unable to
take the initiative through that
medium, and we are, therefore,
taking this means of getting coun
sel from the parent body, which
is your Chamber of Commerce.
'Will you please advise us
whether a representative of the
Island of K.iuai is soon to be nomi
nated and also as to what lime of
the year would be most agreeable
to you for the Promotion Com
mittee to come over?
"We have heard that Mr. Ar
thur Rice has been named amongst
others for the membership on the
board, but this was merely hear
say."

the following unusual and highly
interesting comments on the home

I "I (t! e Go ernor) am not responsi-
i it.. ..ui... L.:- J iL...
uic iui me b;mci5 ueing uuwm weie.
6es:de3, I am against the government
lands beinj taking up by homesteaders.
Ilcrr.es'catiing is not a success; will never

nt a success and yon know it damred
w.ll.
"1 am going down to Kauai scon and tl
settle the whole business. I am going to
settle that side (meaning Makce) first,
ai.d then if the otheis want anything they
oil corn? to me afterward.
'I am going to make these fdlows
sign up (meaning the homesteaders, but
he did not say with whom) and after
hey have signed I am going to make
hem sign another paper stating they are
satisfied.
'All the cane lands of the government
should retrain in the ownership of the
government and be leased to the sugar
plantations. I deliberately plarned to
et this (the Kapaa pilikia) diag on and
wear those people out down there, and I
have about accomplished my purpose.
Now I am going down to Kauai and get
this thing fixed up to suit myself."
