Realizing that the immediate future
will witness the most extensive prose
cutions in the history of the city ot
Phoenix of persons involved in regis
tration anil primary election frauds,
and further realizing that these prose
cutions will necessarily involve time
ami effort,. City Attorney George D.
i 'hi isty yesterday handed his formal
resignation to City Clerk Frank,
Thomas and mailed a copy to the
mayor and each of the city commis
sioners. Rather than undertake the
outlining of a program that promises
to be a wholesale cleaning up of those
whose activities have already caused
cnests and then be obliged to turn it
all over to his successor. Mr. Christy
decided that it was best that his res
ignation should be In the hands of the
new commission and clear the way for
such action as that body decides to
take. His resignation after numerous
prosecutions were under way would
necessarily hamper his successor, if one
is apiHiinteu, and make more difficult
the securing of convictions.
The announcement of the resigna
tion of Attorney Christy did not come
us a surprise to those who have boen
watching the general trend of affairs
the past few days. The investigation
already begun of illegal registrations,
illegal voting, colonization and a dozen
vnd one other election irregularities has
hardly mrei-th(-ncrHetd the sur
face, but enough has been revealed to
convince loose lamuuir wmi ueeiop
ments that the most sensational prose
cutions of persons far higher up than
any that heretofore have been men
tioned, are pending. It will mean that
the prosecuting officer must devote
his entire tiine and entire energies to
working" out the details and then to
handling the cases as they come into
court
Just how many prosecutions are
likely to come of the investigation al
leady begun tan only be guessed at. It
is known that the men working back
of It all have already secured evidence
that would involve not less than two
hundred individuals. It is altogether
likely that today's election will in one
wav or another add to this number.
There is another reason involved in
the resignation of Attorney Christy at
this time. Mr. Christy is desirous that
none can attach political significance
to the activity he has already shown
in bringing about election fraud prose
cutions. Mis resignation is to become
effective on May 1, the same date
that upon which the new commission

MILITIA CALLED TO CONTROL

HAVERHILL, Mass., April 3. The
.local company of the state militia
was called upon by Mayor Albert L.
Bartlett tonight to Nas?ist the police
in controlling o crowd of 5,000 people
concerned in a riotous demonstration
in the vicinity of the city hall. Many
windows in the building were broken
by missiles.
The crowd assembled as the result
of an attempt to hold the meeting in
the hall for the destruction of state

East of the Meuse around Vaux there
had been considerable fighting between
the French and Germans in which the
French were victorious in driving back
the Teutons to the northern outskirts
of tile Caillette woods, and in reoccu-

of Vaux, which they had previously

The occupation by the Germans of

ever, the Germans met no foe. the
French having evacuated their position
at night without the Germans observ-
the movement. From their new po
sitions south of the Froges Brook and
at Bethincourt, the French poured a
direct and flanking fire into the at
tacking Germans, who suffered heavy
casualties. Along, the remainder of the French
front, artillery bombardments have pre
dominated, although there have been
aerial combats near Verdun in which
the Germans lost four aeroplanes and
aerial raids by the French on various
Germans 'cantonments in Belgium.
Artillery duels between the Germans
and Russians continue on the eastern
front. An attack by the Germans
against the Bridge head at Ikskull was
repulsed by the Russians. The usual
bombardments are in progress on the
Austin-Italian line.
Constantinople reports that the
Turks, strongly reinforced, have
checked the Russian offensive in the

asserts that the Russians have seized
heavily fortified Turkish positions at
an altitude of 10.000 feet on the Timer

tured a Turkish position and dispersed
a Turkish cavalry detachment.

Predict Big Battle
LONDON, April 4. The Times' mil
iary correspondent, in an account of!
his visit to Verdun and the French
front, predicts the development shortly
of a big battle on the British front:
"The Germans," says the correspond
ent, "have their army distributed in two
great masses one in front of the Brit
ish army and the other around Verdun.
The first group numbers tbirty-four
divisions and the latter thirty divisions.
The rest of the line in France is thinly
held.
-"From this distribution one must
suppose either that the Germans intend
to attack the British or expect the Brit
ish to at'.ack them."
Discussing Verdun, the correspond
ent pays an enthusiastic tribute to the
French commander. General Petain.
"Although an infantry commander
by training," he says. "General Petain
has made a special study of artillery.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 3.
The fear expressed yesterday at army
headquarters that Francisco Villa had
escaped from the region in which Gen
eral Pershing's cavalry columns are
operating, became a conviction by the
close of today. No report from Mex

but all information secured, indicated'
that he was gone.
General Pershing's report, received
after noon, contained the news, that at
least a part of the dispersed Villa
force that was driven from Guerrero
March 2H still was moving in the
district northeast of that place, but
no mention of Villa's whereabouts was
made. The reprt was dated yester
day. Six columns of cavalry were rirt-
inj? in the hills and plains in that
section, while scouts were endeavor
ing to pick up the trail of the scat

fugitive chief.
One force of Villa's men, estimated
at 100, commanded by Colonel Beltran.
was located near .Bacineva, about 23
miles northeast of Guerrero, and in-1
formation was gathered that indicated
the remainder of the four or five I

GULLET TRIAL
GETS SLOWLY
The court, martial, composed of
commissioned officers of the Arizona
National Guard, to try Capt. Clarence
V. Gulley, for conduct unbecoming to
an officer, and prejudicial to military
discipline, convened yesterday morn
ing at the state capital.
The court is composed of Lieut. Col.
H. H. Donkersley, president of the
court; Major F.. P. Grmstead. Captain
K. M. Robinson, Captain L. G. Browne,
nnd Captain Lee J. Holzworth, judge
advocate. m
The majority of the morning session
was taken up with arguments as to
whether or uot the court martial had
jurisdirtion over Gulley.
Capt. J. L. B. Alexander, and F.
Louis Zimmerman, are representing
Gulley. As soon as the court had
convened, Alexander stated that he
wished to object to the court's jur
isdiction. He said that he did not
challenge any one member of the
court, but that as a whole, they were
illegally convened. The fact that Ad
jutant General Charles W. Harris, the
accuser of Gulley. had called the court
and had named the officers to sit in
the case, was strictly illegal, was
maintained by Alexander. He then ex
plained that for the court to be legal
ly brought together, it would be neces
sary for the Governor of the state to
call the court together, and name
its members. The fact that Harris
had called for six members, while
the knv requires that only five sit
in such a case was also entered in
the objection.
As soon as Alexander's objections
had been placed befdre the court, an
executive session was declared to be
in order, and everyone was excluded
from the room. The executive ses
sion lasted the remainder of the fore
noon.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 3. Over vig
orous objection by Chairman Cham
berlain of the military committee, tho
senate today voted 35 to 30 for tho
Cummins plan to amend the army
reorganization bill by creating a na
tional guard section of the general
stafT. When recess was taKen tonight
the chairman and other members of
the committee were fighting hard
against a second amendment cham
pioned by Senator Cjtmmins and Senator-Lee
ut- Maryland,- -which wouV.
eliminate the provision for a federal
volunteer army.
Senator Chamberlain charged "dur
ing the debate that pernicious activ
ity on the part of officers both tlie
national guard and the regular array
threatened to undo the months of ser
ious work done by the committee, and
he threatened that unless the army
officers ceased attempting to interfere
with legislation through personal ap
peal to senators, he would seek to
have them disciplined by the war de
partment. The officers who appeared
before the committee were unwilling-
to -ee their plans worked Into a tio
mogeneous bill and as soon as they
concluded their testimony began to
attempt to influence friendly senators.
' The committee might just as well
ive up, if each officer is going to
be able to induce his senator to with
1'nM his support until the measure
embodies everything the officer
wants. Senator Chamberlain sata.
I want to express great regret that
the national guard has seen fit to
inject itself into the halls of congress,
until now It looks as if it were a
fight between the regular forces and
the national guard, as to whiph is to
be considered in legislation which ef
fects the whole country.
"I am not gong to limit that criti
cism to the nattional guard. J hav
devoted nearly three months of my
time to working just as hard as I
know how, and this hill has run the
gamut of the department, includinfr
the general staff, the war college and.
all the other military bodies of tho
government. We have had the views
of the representative men of these or
ganizations and after we have under
taken to ' formulate a bill which
seemed in the committee, at least, to
meet prettv generally the approval of
the authorities, we find that not only
the national guard and its officers
and I sometimes fear a lobby is be
ing maintained for that purpose but
officers of the army around the halla
of the senate and house of represen
tatives are interfering with this legis
lation through different senators, in
stead of ieaing the matter lo the
representatives who have had it in
haud and were responsible."
