Department of Agriculture
Says There Are 146,
000,000 Bushels.
FIGURES ARE DEBAT
ABLE, HOWEVER
!•,,
Replies too Variable to make
Deduction Possible
Much used for Seed.
Washington, April 4.—Wheat of the
1915 crop unfit for milling is estimat
ed at 146,000,000 bushels as a result
of an inquiry made by the department
of agriculture through flour mills and
grain, elevators.
The replies are so variable as to
make a deduction impossible, and
any estimate is debatable without
considerable qualification. On these
replies, the average worked out 14.4
er cent as the wheat unfit for mill
ng and 7.8 per cent, or 74,000,000
bushels as feed for live stock.
"Much wheat was used this season
for milling, which ordinarily would
not be regarded as fit to mill," says
the report of the bureau of crop esti
mates.
"Modern machinery enabled those
who had such equipment to make
millable much wheat: which small
millers, lacking such facilities, could
not use. Much wheat not good enough
for local millers was shipped out, ap
parently finding a ready demand at
terminal points and abroad. The
different ways of regarding such
wheat accounts largely for the wide
variation of estimates. The wheat
usually fed to live stock has not been
regarded by the grain trade to be of
material proportions, not more than
two per cent of the crop."

On March 30 the- Russian hospital
ship Portugal was sunk in the Black
sea. The Portugal had. a large num
ber of wounded aboard. She was 444
feet in length and had a gross ton
nage of 6,563 tons.
The official statement issued from

wounded soldiers stopped her engines. tugal asserted she had been attacked
off Ffetlsh, four miles from the coast by a German submarine and that t^-o
and began pumping out some barges torpedoes were fired, the second hit
when an enemy submarine appeared
and after circling around the ship for
some time, chose position about one

ond struck her amidship, the boilers
exploding and the ship breaking in

the ship's permanent staff and a de
tachment of the Red Cross, numbered

which sank In less than a minute.
The Portugal had 272 persons aboard,
of whom 158 were saved.
No report has yet been made of
the sinking of the Portugal either
from the German or Turkish side,
and the announcement by the Turkish
war office that a Russian transport,
with troops and war material aboard,
was sunk by a Turkish submarine
March 30 may have some bearing on
the loss of the Portugal, although the
transport is referred to as a 12,000
ton ship.

San Antonio. Tex., April 4.—Official admission of the belief that
Villa has fled far beyond the American forces and now la operating
south of Chihuahua was made at General Funston's headquarters.
Since yesterday much information indicating that Villa waa In the

Ijetoher at Chihuahua. If it, is proven beyond doubt that. Villa la on
his way south toward Parral. the campaign against him cannot be car
ried much farther without the help of railroads and more troops to
strengthen the lines of communication. This was frankly stated at
General Fonston's headquarters, where It was Intimated representa
tions to this effect would be made at Washington.
TO PROTECT LINE OF OOMMUXlOATIOIf.
Washington, April 4.—General Funston advised tbe war department
that he Is sending more troops Into Mexico from Columbus to protect
the line of communication with General Pershing. Funston did not
state whether any additional troops have been sent forward to the
military baae.
So far Funston has not suggested the reinforcement, of Pershing's
forces, except merely to protect the extended communication lines,
and there Is no confirmation of border reports that extensive additions
to the fighting column would be required.
Ijate reporta to the war department say that parts of fifth and 11th
cavalry, and the 30th and 24th Infantry stationed at Columbia, fnm
ton did not state whether some of those troops have been sent aooaa
the border, or whether others have been brought from nrartry
tion*. Nineteen Apache scouts and trailers have been ordered from
Fort Apache, Ariz., to Pershing's column. Captain Hazzard of tha
10th cavalry, who was with Funston when he captured Aguinaldo, left
with the soouts for the border, but he will not accompany tiwi Into
Mexico.
MUST CAREFULLY Gl'ARD LINE.
San Antonio, April 4.—Convinced that Villa is south of Chihua
