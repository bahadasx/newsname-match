statements were made to the jury and

Deputy U. S. Attorney Johnson for the
government declared Craig to be an
I'.idian of more than ordinary intelli
gence who deliberately and with a
knowledge that he was violating the
laws cohabited illegally with Rena
Sampson. Judge Lowell for the de
fendant declared the evidence would
show the case grows out of the ani
mosity felt toward the defendant by
ether Indians. He declared the da.

Fifth cavalry.
SAN ANTONIO, April 4. Villa Is
south of Parral, a message today
from Consul Letcher, at Chihuahua,
said. Headquarters has been without
-ord from Pershing recently. No re
ports of further fighting have been
re ceived.
EL PASO, April 4. American
troops, approaching Durango south of
Chihuahua are moving with surpris
ing rapidity. On Friday, Dodd ap
peared near Cuslhuriachi. Simultane
ously Villa was near Satevo, SO miles
south. R is believed he will not at
tempt to Join Reyes In the Torreon re
gion. Instead he probably will hide
in the Sierras.
Fifteen thousand Carranzistas are
marching northward from Torreon.
It Is believed they intend to attack
Reyes. Sample announced that Per.
shing will send an aeroplane In the
event of Villa's capture. Pershing Is
believed to be south of San Antonio,
so close upon VUIa that he has not
time to reach his lines of communica
tion. Juan Terrazas. a cattleman, arrived
today and confirmed the report that
Villa is heading for Satevo with a
small band of followers.
It Is not believed that Villa is
wounded.
United Press Correspondent Ja
cobs reported that Colonel Erwin and
not Dodd actually led the (00 caval
r men who routed Villa. Mexicans
had notified Villa of the American's
coming and so prevented a complete
surprise. Jacobs claimed SO VUUstas
were killed.
The task of maintaining communi
cation lines is increasing and possibly
the reinforcements are destined to
march to Guerrero. The wide area
over which the manhunt is spreading
perhaps has caused the request for
additional forces. Captain Hazzard
of the tenth cavalry and 19 Apache
scouts and an interpreter left Fort
Apache to Join Pershing.
EL PASO, April 4. Four American
soldiers have died as the result of ill
ness or accidental injuries In Mexico.
Three hundred have returned sick
.None were killed in battle.
