The speed limits under tho new law
wilt bo as follows: Twctvo miles an

haMng 23-horsepowcr will pay $11 regis
tration, Instead of US, as at present.
It Is understood that the reductions

put $50,000 or more In the treasury.
A fee of S will be charged for one

LIKELY IN SENATE
Committee Disposed to Report
Measure for Retirement
System With Favor.
The Senate may be called on to pass
a pension and retirement bill for the
civil servlco employes of the Govern
ment in the near future.
It was disclosed today, following a
meeting of tho Senvte Civil Service
Committee, that tho committee was dis
poned to report such a measure favor
ably. The committee discussed the subject
at some length, and while it took no
action it is likely to do so at its next
meeting.
Tho measure which Is favored Is one-
auDstantlally like the Fomerene bill, In
troduced in January. It provides for a
retirement system and pensions based
on the contributory plan.
Senator Pomorene sad he expected
any bill reported would bo based on
tho contributory plan. He did not
think the committee would favor a
straight pension proposition.
Senator Pomcreno said ho had con
sulted an actuary as to certain fea
tures of tho proposed system. As soon
as data was at hand which he desired,
no wouia can unoincr meeting or tne
committee.
The bill which It Is expected will be
reported Is also along the .lines of the
bill Senator Cummins favored when he
was chairman of the Civil Service
Committee.
Although it looks as if tho bill
would bo reported, It Is not expected
that it will bo passed this scslson. Oth
er legislative matters would doubtless
block It. It would go to tho calendar
and Senotor Pomcreno would call It up
when possible.

England Throws Down Gauntlet
to This Country on Right to
Board Neutral Craft.
CONTROVERSY IS OLD ONE
Question Was Partly Respon
1 sible for War of 1812, and
Has Cropped Up Slnoe.
Great Britain has thrown down the
gauntlet to the United States by Insist
ing on her right to seise from American
merchant ships passengers and crews
suspected of German or Austrian na
tionality. In a lengthy note received at the State
Department this morning, the British
government, It Is authoritatively stated,
tefuses to comply with the demand of
the United States for the release of some
thirty or more Germans taken, on Feb
ruary 10, from the American Trans
Pacific liner China, and now held either
at the British leased port of Hongkong,
China, or somewhere In Japan.
From almost the birth of- the Amer

strained tho relations between the Uni

has been engaged with .a third power.

American Territory.
The position of the United Btates has
bieen consistently that American ships
are to all Intents and purposts Ameri

no more right to board the one' than
to Invado the other for the purpose of
capturing enemy subjects or sympa
thizers. Three times In the course of the pres
ent war the United States has had oc
casion to call both Great Britain and
franco sharply to account. Heretofore
sach time the demand has been made
for "the Immediate release" of persons
so captured, the demand has been com

BERLIN. Aorll 4. The Dutch gov

has refused to comply with an Informal
reoueat from the allies that she close
her frontier to Germany.
Mllltarv measures have been taken by
Holland as a warning that she will re
sist any attempt to force her to aid in
the olan to "starve out Germany."
There Is no longer anv doubt here that
the Dutch activities were Inspired by
developments of the allied conference
at Parle.
The allies, thus far, have made no
formal demand upon Queen Wilhelmina,
It Is reliably stated. Ministers of the
allies at The Hague approached the
Dutch foreign office with Informal rep
resentations in the nature of 'feelers."
Queen Wilhelmlna's answer was to
summon Parliament Into special ses
sion and cancel leaves of absence.
LONDON, April 4. A Rome wireless

from Zurich that Holland had closed the

troops on the German border. The re

Stock Men Accuse Packers
Of Forcing Up Meat Prices
Representatives of Big Inter
ests in Capital to Demand
Sweeping Investigation.
GO BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEE
Declare Live Stook Prices Are
Dropping, While Meat Prices
Are Sent Soaring.
By JUDSON C. WELLIVER.
Declaring that the price of meat to
the consumer Is going up rapidly, while
tho price of live stock has been going
down, and charging that a combination
of packers and stock yard corporations
Is responsible, representatives of big
live stock producing Interests are In
Washington demanding the most sweep
ing investigation that has ever been
made of the whole live stock and meat
business.
"Tho whole world Is awakening to the
fact that the biggest economic problem
of our time Is distribution," declared
Walter L. Fisher, former Secretary of
the Interior, today. Mr. Fishes Is hero
as counsel of the American National
1.1 ve Stock Association, which is de
manding attention to the subject.
They are appearing berore a subcom
mittee of the House Judiciary Commit
tee, which Is considering a resolution,
by Congressman Borland of Missouri,
directing an investigation by the Fed-i
era I Trade commission, congressman
Uoollttle of Kansas also has pending a
resolution for a Congressional Investi
gation. M. M. McClure. of Kansas City, presi
dent of the National Organization of
Ltvu Stock Commission Merchants, Is
among those representing the stock In
terests. A number of representatives of the big
packers are here. Including Arthur
Meeker, vice president of Armour & Co.,
and Robert C. McManus, representing
Hutft & Co.
Movement Long Forming.
The movement for a new and sweep
ing Investigation for the whole meat In
dustry has been taking form for some
time.
The live stock men protest that the
country has never been satisfied with
the result of former probes. They say
the Garfield report on the meat Indus
try, while unquestionably honest and
wclMntenUoned, failed to carry con
viction, and that the subsequent pro
ceedings In court. In which the packers
got. tho benefit of an Immunity bath.
were at least equally unsatisfactory.
Following, this, the packers used the.
National Packing Company as a nu
cleus about which to gather together
various Independent concerns. The Na
tional racKinc company was aiterwaras
dissolved, following a Government pro
ceeding, but the live stock men say tnai
Its constituent factors were distributed
among the big packing firms and that
no progress was made toward estab
l.shlng effective competition. They are
now Insisting that general conditions in
the Industry absolutely demand some
effective action or else farmers are go
ing to quit raising meat.
Mr. Fisher pointed out that prices of
live stock on the hoof were lower In
October and the succeeding months or
IMS than In the samo months of 114.
This he regarded as a phenomenon that
out to be Investigated, because It would
naturally be presumed that the condi
tions of 1915 would cause higher rather
than lower prices.
He observed that the war demand had
raised prices of all other foodstuffs, and
nlan that there had been less Importa
tion of meat from the Argentine in 19U
than In MM.
Further than this, the war demand for
leather had greatly Increased the price

EL PASO, Tex., April 4,
American troops today are report
ed approaching the Durango stato
line, south of Chihuahua City, on
Villa's trail.
Their swift advance has sur
prised border officials. On Friday,
Colonel Dodd's cavalry column
appeared at San Antonio, near
Cusihuihirachic. Villa, then, with
only eight men, was reported to
have passed through Satevo, about
fifty miles south of the American
vanguard.
He is said to be fleeing for his
old haunts in .the Durango
mountains.

The belief Is growing that Villa waa
not wounded In the clash at Guerrero.
General Pershing's information capia
from Mexican wood cutters, who said
they had seen Villa.
Villa has no Intention of rormlnr a
Junction with Canuto Reyes In thai
Torreon district. It is believed, but will
attempt to hide from the pursuing
American forces In the Durango Sierras.
The reported movement of 15,000 Car
ranza soldiers northward from Torreon
la believed to be evidence of the an
nounced Carranza campaign against tho.
Reylstas.
The prolonged absence of a report on
the status of the pursuing has resulted
In a request from Washington to Brig
adier General Pershing for a detailed
statement.
May Have Escaped.
"In case of Villa's capture or any bis
development," said Major Sample at
Columbus today, "General Pershing
would send an aeroplane to some point
on his line of communication."
The possibility that Villa has escaped
the cordon drawn by Colonel Dodd and
General Pershing Is admitted by army
men.
Criticism is being heard among soma
officers of the type of aeroplane now in'

the aviators.
The engines are not powerful enough
