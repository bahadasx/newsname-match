" . More Troops Sent
Washington, April 4 General Fun
ston advised the war department to
day he was sending more troops into
Mexico 'from Columbus to protect the
line of communication with General
Pershing. - He did jiot state whether
additional troops had been sent for
ward to the military base.
So far General Funston has not sug
gested reinforcement of General
Pershing's forces except merely to
protest the extended communication
lines and there was no confirmation
today of border reports that exten
sive additions -to the fighting column
would be required.
Late reports - to the war depart
ment say parts of the 5 th and 11th
cavalry and the 20th and 24th infan
try, were stationed at Columbus. Gen
eral Funston did not state whether
some of those troops had" been sent
across the border or whether others
had been brought from nearby sec
tions. - - - v- .
Nineteen Apache scouts and trailers
have been ordered from Fort Apache,
Ariz., to General Pershing's column.
Captain Hazzard, of the 10th cavalry,
who was with General Funston when
he (captured Aguinaldo, left with the
scouts for the border today but he
will not accompany them into Mexico.
The - army censorship today veiled
the number anad personnel of addi
tional trpops which have been sent
across the border. Major General
gcott, chief of staff, said that extra
troops had left Columbus ' two days
ago but no word of the movement
had beenallowed to leak out. It was
believed that the fifth cavalry recenti-
ly , sent froni Fort Myer, Va, Fort
Sheridan, ! Ills., and Fort Leavenworth,
Kas, were drawn upon. ,
IvINE IS STRENGTHENED
El Paso, April 4. With Francisco
Villa still in flight and his whereabouts
apparently unknown to his pursuers,
the campaign of the American forces,
now scouring northern Chihuahua for
the bandit, entered today upon a
broader phase New troops have been
ordered in Mexico from the military
base at Columbus, N. M., to protect
the lengthening line of communica
tion-
Villa has been reported at many
points within the - broad zone that
ranged from the Rayon country to the
Benito Juarez district. The last Mex
ican report was that he was south of
Safevo and heading for Parral.but this
could not be confirmed. The diffi
culties of the pursuit have multiplied
because of the misleading informa
tion given by Mexican peons to Gen
eral Pershing's men. Army men here
believe that as Villa moves southward
with his trail covered for the time at
least, it will be necessary to establish
new army bases and strongly guard
the line of communications.
Large reinforcements of American
troops will be needed, the military
authorities say.

Washington, April 4 Treasury of

charges that a number of deputy , in

More than 100 deputy collectors are
