ing of a storm sewer would cost $10,-
672.90.

street.
Halm Gets Contract.
Joe Hahn, city scavenger, was
awarded the contract for the cleaning
of the septic tank. He submitted a
bid of $18$ for the work. William
Peckles submitted a bid of $200. It
cost the city $250 to have the tank
cleaned last fall.
Sweeping, cleaning and springling
the streets contract for this season
was awarded at a decrease of about
$64 over last year. Last year it
cost the city about $273 a month to
have the streets, cleaned, swept and
sprinkled. Contract for this work

evening for $209. Bids submitted
were as follows: Elmer Marin,
$264, Joe McTaggart $262.50, Wes
Wright $247.98, James Miller $266
and William Peckles $247.
Alderman Ervin urged the council
to consider the buying of a motor
sprinkler for Bemidji. He stated
that upon investigation that he found
that the sprinkling and cleaning of
streets could be secured at a much
lower cost than the city is now pay
ing.
Miller Lowest Bidder.
Frank Miller was awarded the con
tract for the building of a private
office in the city hall for the use of
the chief of police. His bid was $81.
A petition signed by property own
ers urging the vacation of the end of
Fourth street for a site for the naval
militia armory was filed.
C. G. Johnson was granted a jitney
license. The jitney license in Be
midji is $50.
The council was split in their opin
ions in regard to the enforcement of
the ordinance which provides for an
indemnity bond of $3,000 for jitney
operators. Alderman Ervin protest
ed against the enforcement of this
ordinance, stating that he did not be
lieve in making a hardship for the
jitney operators. He stated that the
jitney service was a good thing for
the city as a whole and that he did
not believe that the council should
take into consideration whether or
not it was injuring other private en
terprises in Bemidji.
Bond Cost $160.
It was pointed out that a bond
would cost each jitney owner about
$160.
City Attorney Russell stated that
the city is absolutely under no risk
and that a bond is only to protect
the passenger if the driver of a jit
ney was unreliable. He stated that
Duluth had at one time considered
the same matter and that the matter
was dropped there.
Alderman Bailey stated that in his
belief that the jitneys were a God
send to Bemidji and that they should
be encouraged.
Alderman Smart urged the enforc
ing of the ordinance.
Insurance Men Benefit.
President Lycan pointed out that
the city would get no benefit while
the insurance companies would. He
suggested that the raising of the li-

cense fee would be a better way to
limit the number of jitney operators.
No Action Taken.
No action was taken in regard to
the matter. Mayor Vandersluis and
Chief Ripple yesterday notified all jit

required and two weeks' notice was
given. All jitney operators will be

Diamond Point if he would do police
duty on the point during the sum
mer months.
Bridge Matter Up.
Alderman Ervin suggested that the
council take some action in regard
to the building of a bridge over the
Mississippi river inlet. He stated
that he believed that the railroad
would install gates and alarm sys
tem in the present location rather
than extend the street along the lake
shore and open up Second street.
It was suggested that the lake shore
route be dropped on account of the
expense.
Alderman Miller urged that action
be taken immedately and that the
lake shore project be not dropped.
The street committee was auth
orized to investigate the two routes
and to prepare estimates of the cost
of each project.
The salary of Judge D. H. Fisk as

Insurance Companies Agree to De

Commissioner.
St. Paul, Minn., April 4.All
Northern Minnesota is to have the
basis fire insurance rate enjoyed by
Southern Minnesota. This is the an
nouncement made by the state in
surance commissioner.
Until last fall Southern Minne
sota, including the Twin Cities, en
joyed the lowest basis*rate. Central
and Northwestern Minnesota were
paying a higher rate, and the sixteen
northeasterly counties of the state
a rate even higher than that paid in
the central and northwestern por
tions. Y'
Nov. 24 last, Commissioner Iporits
of the state department, order*! the
General Inspection company torSuse a
uniform basis rate ythroughoflk "the
state and further demanded that this
uniform basis rate be no higher than
that prevalent in Southern Minne
sota. Mr. Works declared at the
time that he would permit towns
having an extra fire hazard to have
a higher rate, but he insisted that
such towns must, be considered indi
vidually.
All Towns to Be Rerated.
The General Inspection company,
after some negotiations, agreed to
lower the rate in Central and North
western Minnesota to agree with the
Southern Minnesota rate, but insist
ed that there was. justification for
the higher basis rate in the sixteen
heavily timbered norJbekst counties.
Mr. Works and Mr. Fisher have
spent several weeks in these north
east counties inspecting some 400
towns and villages. The result is
the agreement on the part of the
General Inspection company granting
credit reductions on existing rates.
These reductions will apply until the
various towns have been reinspected
and rerated under the uniform basis
rate agreement.

FORTY CENTS FEE MONTH
ATTORNEY RULES
THAT OSTEOPATH
IS NOT ELIGIBLE
Dr. Shannon is Hired at Salary of
$600 Per Tear Physician
Last Tear.
ACTION AT FORMER
MEETING RECONSIBte&
City Heads Unanimous in etto*t
State Osteopaths May Test
Action.
As a result of the opinion of City
Attorney Russell requested by the
city council on the appointment of
Dr. F. J. Darragh, an osteopath, as
city physician, the council last eve
ning reconsidered the appointment of
Dr. Darragh and Dr. E. A. Shannon,
city physician last year, was hired
at $600 for city physician and health
officer for the ensuing year.
The action of the council was un
animous.
May Be Tested.
Their action may result in a test
case. This was the first time that
an osteopath was appointed to the
office of physician in the state and
state osteopaths may bring a test
case to prove that they are eligible
to the office.
The opinion of City Attorney Rus
sell is as follows:
Section 36 of Chapter 4, Charter
of the City of Bemidji, provides that:
'The health department shall consist
of three members, one of whom shall
be a physician, duly licensed to prac
tice medicine within the State of
Minnesota, of good standing in his
profession, and who shall have been
in practice for at least three years,'
who shall be called 'health officer.'
Not in Charter.
"It will be seen from the fore
going that this officer is entitled to
a salary as well as any of the elec
tive -or -appointive offices,4o which
a salary is attached, and the method
of allowing it to go to the lowest
bidder, is to say the least, an inno
vation, not sanctioned by the char
ter, and puts the care of the sick
poor and dependents as well as the
preservation of the public health on
a very low plane.
"I fully understand why this was
donesimply to take the burden of
making a selection off the shoulders
of the council, from a number of ap
plicants.
"The call for 'bids' in response to
which Dr. Darragh's tender was re
ceived, informed all physicians that
the duties would be the regular du
ties of a health officer and as city
physician to take care of the worthy
poor of the city, its paupers and
other duties required by ordinance,
said physician to furnish the neces
sary medicines, bandages, convey
ances, etc'
"While the wording of the call for
bids is somewhat ambiguous, in that
it says 'taking care of the worthy
poor of the city, etc.,' and 'furnish
ing necessary medicines, bandages,
etc.,' which might be done by any
layman, the words, 'City Physician,'
has a well understood meaningtha
medical attendance on and treatment
of the city poor.
"In the proposal of Dr. Darragh he
agrees to 'furnish such bandages and
supplies as the other health officers
have done.'
Duties Twofold.
"The duties of our 'Health Officer*
are twofold. He must, as health of
ficer, attend to the sanitary condi
tions of the city, the prevention of
epidemics, the quarantining of com
municable diseases, etc., and as city
physician he must prescribe for and
treat the poor and dependent of the
city.
"So far as the first part of his du
ties are concerned I have no hestita
tion in saying that Dr. Darragh is
eligible.
"As to the second proposition, Dr.
Darragh belongs to the school known
as osteophatic and the title of 'phys
ician' has been extended to practi
tioners of this school. A 'phys
ician' is variously defined to he 'one
skilled in physic,' *a doctor of med
icine,* a 'person who has received the
degree of doctor of medicine from an
incorporated institution,' 'one law
fully engaged in the practice of med
icine.'
"The 'Horton Law,' Sec. 4994,
Statutes of Minn.~ 1913, says 'the
practice of osteopathy is hereby de
clared distinct from that of medicine
or surgery within the meaning of the
law, but with respect to the control
of communicable diseases, osteophatic
physicians shall be subject of all lo
cal and state laws and regulations
that govern other physicians, and
