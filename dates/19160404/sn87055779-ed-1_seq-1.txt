U. S. WILL BEJECT
ENTENTE REPLY
Answer to Protest Against
Mail Seizures Fails to
Vital Points.
Intertifltional News Servite:
WASHINGTON", Ap-il : The
T'nited States will not accept with
out further strong protest the claim
of the entente allies that they have
the riKht to continue mail seizure?.
The reply filed with the state de
partment, officials say, does not meet
the contentions of the Tnited States.
It ignores a Most entirely the claim
of the Unifd States that mail oil
neutral ships has been taken olT and
detained without warrant despite
the proislon of international law
that permits the free passage of all
first class mail.
Sec'y Lansing said today that he
had not yet fully studied the allied
ieply and that for the present he did
r.ot care to say what further steps
would be taken to safeguard Amer
ican rights. It is understood, how
ever, that another protest tlatly dis
agreeing with the position of the
allies will be prepared shortly.
So far as the submarine situation
is concerned, officials miv tha'. it will
bt impossible to take any action
until all data now being forwarded
by special messenger. is received
here. There is a growing disposi
tion in othcial circles to believe that
it will be impossible to raise the de
cisive issue with Germany over the
attack on the Sussex that was hoped
for. Although morally convinced
that the channel liner was torpe
doed, it now seems likely that this
cannot he legally proven. In conse
quence the president and Sec'y Ioni
sing are carefully examining all of
the available evidence- in connection
with tlx- sinking of other vessels on
r. hu h Americans were endangered.
To Complicate situation.
!t is admitted that the decision of
the IJrb'ish anil French olticials to
arm most of their merchant vessels
in Atlantic trade will c omplicate, the
situation. Although congress agreed
to give the executive branch of the
government a free band in dealing
with the question of armed mer
chantmen it was with the implied
understanding that no issue- would
he raised that might involve the
country in war without concress be
ing consulted. Officials in touch with
the general situation expect that
German submarines will try to get
some of the bi liners now carrying
munitions under private- contract
and if they succeed the president
may be forced to act without Con
sulting congress.

SUCCESS OF U. P.
HINGES ON WIEST
So Argue Politicans Who
Would Prevent Nomination
of Hughes or Roosevelt.
International News Serviee:
WASHINGTON, April 4. Arguing
that inasmuch as the battle ground
for next fall's presidential election
concededly will be in the middle
west, campaign managers for repub
lican candidates from that section
are planning a defensive alliance
which will prevent the nomination
either of Col. Roosevelt or Justice
Hughe?. While these plans still are
tentative, it was learned today that
among the men behind them are
some of the cleverest politicians in
the party. They expect to raise the
argument that not only will the
presidency hinge on the outcome of
the fight in the middh west, but that
control of the United States senate
likewise will be in the balance in
that section.
Arguing that New England and
New York are "certain republican
territory" these political leaders in
sist that the real battle will of neces
sity be fought out in Minnesota. Illi
nois. Ohio, Indiana. Missouri, Kan
sas. Wisconsin. Michigan and Iowa.
Minnesota. Missouri and Wiscon
sin each ele-ct a United States sen
ator and Indiana two. The combined
votes of the middle west in the re
publican convention is about 300.
This combination, voting for any
a i-reed on candidate after the "fa
xorite sons" are disposed of, can
count on the support of the south,
whe re there are about additional
delegates, thus could prevent the
nomination of any eastern man.
This is just what will be done, re
publican lenders here believe.

somewhat a matter of doubt. No in

SAY POLICE LET ONE
GIRL ESCAPE IN RAID
Charles I Anns Acimiscn Ofliccr No.
31 Told Iler to Ix"ne as
They Took Others.
Charles Evans told Pros. Mont
gomery Tuesday morning in city
court that the police knowingly per
mitted Bessie Hawkins to escape on
the night they raided Iiis house at
113 K. Wayne st. Evans was testi
fying in the trial of Hattie Brown,
who was found guilty of frequent
ing a house of ill fame and fined $5
and costs by Special Judge Ham
r.iond. The case was appealed.
After resuming his chair upon com
pleting his testimony, Evans was
questioned by Pros. Montgomery in
regard to the Hawkins woman. He
was asked whether he had seen her
since the raid or knew where she
was. To all questions came the neg
ative reply until the prosecutor
asked:
"Do you know how Bess Hawkins
happene'd to get away that night?"
"Yes," replied Evans. "One of
the otlicers, whose badge bore No. SI,
pointed to the key in the door and
told her 'if you don't go it is your
own fault. She went. You an fig
ure the rest out for yourself."
Several witnesses testified to the
character of Hattie Brown. After
being convicted she had her attorney
fiie an appeal bond to the circuit
court. Evans was found guilty of
operating a house of ill fame a few
days ago and he appealed the case
to the circuit court.

More than -00 Villistas are reported

down in the running fight that fol

by dispatches from field headquar
ters in Mexico that the 7th cavalry
commanded by Col. Erwin, bad the
honor of intlicting the first defeat
upon Vib'a. The 7th. forming one
of the advance pursuing1 columns
under Col. Dodd, learned at Matachie
that Tilla was headed for Guerrero.
Col. Erwin attempted by a night
march through a heavy rainstorm to
head off Villa, but the latter suc

town before the American troopers
arrived.
A PAN PONS ATTACK.
Ititcfiuitior al News Serviee:
EE PASO, Texas, April 4. Fran
cisco Villa has been compelled by the
rapid pursuit of American cavalry to
abandon nis plans for an attack upon
Chihuahua City. On Sunday after
noon the bandit leader, accompan-j
led by eight members of his per-;
sonal bocy guard, v.as in the virin-1
ity of Satevo, 42 miles straight south
of Chihuahua City. At that time his
American pursuers were I'd mib's be
hind the fleeing chieftain.
This wis the news that came to
day by Courier from Casas Grands.
It appeared to be the most reliable
information received during the last
three dajs ns to the whereabouts of
Villa. The same courier report -d i
that intermittent rille firing had been j
heard for several hours op March ill I
near El Valley, tbe sub-base of thej
punitive oxpedition. He said he be-1
liev?l that a skirmish had followed
an a'tempt by a band of mounted!
Mexicans te cut the lines of com
munication between Casas Grandes!
and 1. Valle. j
From the story told by the conr-
ier. It appeared that Villa had a nar- J
row escape from capture w hen Iiis
forces were beaten in the fitjhtincT at
San Geronimo ranch in the Guerrero
district If st Wednesday. The Amer
icans weie close on "PanchnV trail,
but were deceived by their Mexican
guides and were led along a rough !
and almost impassable trail. In the
meantime Villa, taking a shorter and
much easier path, tot several miles;
beyond the point where Col. Dodd
had hoped to catch him.
Villa Tr.neN All Ni"lit.
Nightfall forced the weatio. ,
Americars to halt. Villa travelled'
all night ami by morning had sue-j
cessfully eluded his pursuers. The
Mexican guides, whose misleading
Information had permitted Villa's es
cape weie sent to th" rear of the
American column and are reported
to be sti l under arrest. i
Though the safety of Chihuahua !
City was assured by the rapid pace j
of the Americans when they again)
picked u:i Villa's trail, army officers I
in El Pao shook their heads in:
doubt when they learned that the!
fugitive had reached the neighbor-)
hood of Satevo. About this adobe i
village on the Rio San Pedro luster
mountains ioiming as ruuKeo an-i
trearher us a bit of country as ever
sheltered a banl of ut-throats. In
the hill along the San Pedro and
its confluents a regiment miht bei
securely hidden away and frontiers-'
men declare that Villa and his elcht ;
followers may rest there In security!
indefinitely. i
In pressing forward in p;ir.-;;it of
Villa thf American troops are ex-i
p"sed to flank attacks from the va-i
rlous bands into which bandit's
force wa-! div ided following the de-
feat at S.n Gernonimo. The aero
plane -'out- with Gen. Pershing's)
expedition may be able to prevent
anv surprise, but in the thick woods j
the band ts might escape the eye of)
the military observers high in thej
air.
It wis not until Saturday. thrfe
clays after the battle at Sin G-ron-l
imo that Villa's trail was agnin pick-
ed up at San Andres. L'2 miles wet 1
of Chihu ihua City. He appeared to;
be heade d directly for Chihu thua. !

ed by a spy that American"-' had ar- J

"Basil Forsythe," in Jail For
Fraud, Said to Have Eloped
With Married Woman.
E. II. .Miller, alias Fasil Forsythe,
the inatrazine anent. who is being
held in the county jail to await ac
tion of the circuit court gTand Jury
upon a charge .f obtaining money
under false pretenses. ran away
witn a woman in Elmyra, N. Y.,
adopted her husband's nam' and up
until the time1! he was arrested hero
10 days ago, lived with her. accord
ing to information in the hands of
the local police department.
The woman app ar'd in city court
when Miller was given a pr liminary
hearing and testified that she was
Marjorie Forsythe and married Mil
ler, alias Forsvthe. in Elmyra. N. Y..
on Aug. 2rt. PU2.
From the information in the
hands of th police, the woman lid
not marry Pasil For.-ythe, but the
Forsythe she married is not the man
in th ounty jail, but is in Elmyra
awaiting the summon. of the au
thority's here no te stify against Mil
ler. This information came to the
local police two days ago and in the
meantime they have be-n making
an effort to locate Mrs. F"isythe. It
has been customary for her to visit
Miller at th- county jail twice, daily
since? his incarceration, but she did
not appear there either Monday or
Tuesday, this leading to the belief
thai, she has left the city. It ha-H
been learned that she was employed
at the Oliver hotel all las! week but
left there Saturday. She was at the
county jail on Sunday afternoon.
Pair IMJuiiKars.
According to th. information r
ceived here, Miller went to Elmyra,
whe-re he met the Forsythe woman.
Suddenly the pair lisapp-nr'd and
although the husband has been mak
ing a search for his vyif-, he had no
trace of her until Mille r was am-.-.t-ed
her. Now h" is ready to come
to South Hend and t-stify against
Miller, although it is not known
vvlu'ther h would tak any action
against the woman. Th- police have
not b;-en instructed to urrest he r but
are anxious to talk with her and
Icarn the exact situation.
Miller was chargd with repre
senting himself as a solicitor for the
Leslie-Judge Magazine company and
taking $! from the Muessei pp-w-ing
Ce. When he was given a b-ar-ing
in city court the state produced
a mass of evidence to show that
Miller had been working lh- same
graft throughout the -ntire state
and in a numl er of e.ustern -iti-s.
Evidence was overwm-lmingly
against the youni; man and he was
bound over to .h- higher court
under $:;". bom to await a, hearing
by th- grand j ury.
When '.mentioned regard'eg hi.-'

any dtaiis of th addi'i-mal tr.p
being sent across the Uh Grande,
even d-eiir.intf to nay whether in
fantry or cavalry or both bring

Seemingly authentic statements
were made, howor. that n-w
troops to go are the tifth cavalry,
which was ord-red to the border re
cently. Tbo troops will be used, it
is said, to str ng1he n the -newing

They were of the .elief today that
the chase fnr the outlaw will be ;i.
long and arduous one. It now s, ms
assured that the re-ports that Villa
