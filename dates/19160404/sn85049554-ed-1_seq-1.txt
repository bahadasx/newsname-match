In the letter to General Sarbino, the

useless continuance of a bloody an-i

that he was preparing a proclamation
which would be distributed broadcast
allowing all bandits to come and give

There has been no signs lately of ag

OKLAHOMA NEGRO LYNCHED.
Black Killed For Criminal Assault on
13-Year-Old Girl.
Idabel, Okla., April 4—"Judge Lynch"
tfletf, convicted.' sentenced, and
executed Oscar M&rtln, a negro. In this
City yesterday. Martin was arrested
near Bismarck, charged with having
criminally attacked a 13-year-old
white girl, who with a girl companion
was gathering wild onions in the
woods when the nesro appeared. After
talking to the children the negro threw
Edna Murphy to the ground and began
choking and otherwise mistreating her.
Her companion screamed and ran to
where some negroes were fishing near
by, but they paid no heed to her en
treaties ^nd she went back and met
Edna in a state of hysteria, her clothes
disheveled and torn.
They reported the attack and that
night the negro was captured, identi
fied by the girls, and brought to Idabel
and placed in jail.
Yesterday morning the preliminary
hearing was held In the district court
room and the examination was listened
to by a crowd. The evidence was in
and the court was ready to pronounce
his finding when the mob moved on
the officers who had the negro in
charge, disarmed them, and took
charge of the negro.
A rope \£as soon in evldonce and tno
negro was hustled thru the rear door
of the court house. The rope was
placed around his neck, tied to the rail
ing of the gallery, and Martin was
shoved over the rail, falling about
twelve feet.
In his struggles Martin caught hola
of some upright timbers that supported
the gallery, but he was pulled away
from the support and'a couple of bul
lets put an end to him.
Except for a few cheers and the pis
tol shots the lynching was done quietly,
yet the mob would brook no interfer
ence from the officers.
The evidence In ^he case was posi
tive and there is no danger of having
hanged the wrong man. Martin had
only recently finished a term In the
Arkansas penitentiary, where he was
sent for attempting a similar offense
and where he would have been lynched
had the officers not spirited him away.
