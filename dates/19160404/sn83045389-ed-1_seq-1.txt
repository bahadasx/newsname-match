I?' this informalIon is correct. it tiiMis

chief is headed toward I'arral, and is*
leading* his American pursuers by it
least sixty miles. The nearest to -
tevo American troops are known in
have reached is San Antonio, sixty
miles northwest.
The route said to have been taken by
Villa, niic with which h<- is thoroughly
familiar, is known among' the peons as
"I'ancho's Koad.'"
From 15uerrcro it leads Into a broad
valley which runs east to San Andres,
Villa's old headquarters, thence south
to Santa V&abel, the scene of Villa's
massacre of eighteen \merican mining
men. and then southeast through Sa
