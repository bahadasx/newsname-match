REVOLTS AGAINST
CHIEF CARRANZA
Colonel Cano And
Have Joined
Commander Pershing Searching For
Villa In The Mountains
Ban Antonio, Tex., April 3. That
Colonel Cano, who was leading on;
Of tho heavier Carranza forces oper
ating with the American forces In the
search fir Francisco Villa, had re
Yolted against Carranza and had Join
ed the bandit, is the belief prevailing
in mllitarj circles on the border. The
report of Cano's action has not beci,
confirmed, but is given some credence
at army headquarters.
Unless Villa definitely is located
within the next day or two, it is be
lieved heie that General Pershing will
begin a dogged search for him in the
mountains and south of Guerrero.
Since the defeat of Villa's force March
29 In and near Guerrero tho American
commander has had lightly equipped
mobile detachments of cavalry sweep
ing in whirlwind fashion through the
district about the headwaters of the
Santa Maiia river, In efforts to locate
tho elusie bandit, reported to have
gone In that direction after being des
perately wounded.
General Persuing did not get a re
tort through to General Funston dur
ing the day, but the chief of staff re
ported, indicating that the line or
communication was maintained, and
no mention of Villa was made. There
It, Increasing belief that General
Pershing may havo been deceived in
regard to the direction taken by Villa
and cvfi concerning his injuries.
Some reports Indicate that ho wa8
not Injured at all, and Instead of go
ing northeast of Guerrero ho had
moved Into the hills to the south and
enst, a li:cction American army offi
cers had expected lilm to take.
Tho new Information Is not regard
ed more credible than that which
caused the cordon of troops to bo
drawn across every exit from the dis
trict nnitheast of Guerrero, and It Is
telicved liere that General Pershing
will not t.dopt any new plan until ho

NASTY MESS
STIRRED II'
More Trouble In The Willis
Family Administration
This Time In Department Of
Public Printing
Extravagance And Nepotism
Charged Against Cross
Significant Speech Made By
Arthur I, Vorys
Before The Pennsylvania In
surance Federation
Columbus, 0 April 3 There is
more trouble in the Willis famly ad
ministration, bringing out charges
and counter-charges, between J. E.
Cross, public printer, and E. A. Craw
ford, chairman of the True, or Glue,
Democracy, a former state printer.
Crawford, incensed because one of
his four relatives was dropped from
the payroll by Cross, charges nepo
tism and extravagance, and tells Wil
lis that Cross has increased expenses
of his office more than $50,000 a year.
Cross, In turn, charges Crawford with
family favoritism In office and other
wise says he does not run straight, !
but that he was bought and has the
price in his pocket While the state
at large is humiliated by the specta
cle, they place the blame directly on
Governor Willis with the explanation'
that both Cross and Crawford come
from Adams county. Regular Repub
Hcans who dislike the Willis style
of machine politics are enjoying the
game and sensing a dog fight say
"Sic 'em, Tige!"
Arthur I. Vorys, former Republican
national committeeman from Ohio,
and one of the delegates selected by
Theodore Burton, made a speech be
fore the Pennsylvania Insurance fed
eration at Pittsburgh on March 29. He
denounced the Ohio workmen's com
pensation act as radical and described
this btate as a "horrible example,"
the victim of socialistic impulse and
a menace to insurance interests. He
advised his hearers to resort to "pre
paredness" lest they, too, become
victims of bimilar laws. This address
is Interesting In many respects, but
state fire marshal? And didn't State
ago one of the high officials of the
Pennsylvania state insurance depart
ment said that the employers' liabil
ity insurance companies were ready
to spend millions to repeal the Ohio
law. Mr. Vorys was state insurance
commissioner under three governors
and fought compensation tooth and
toe-nail. It is easy to conjecture what
kind of a candidate and a platform
Mr. Vorys will support at Chicago.
o
Now that Governor Willis Is spend
ing only one day a week at the cap
ltol, the government moves along
more easily. Here's one instance in
which absenteeism pays.
o
Why should Public Printer J. E.
Cross be criticised for appointing his
wife as chief clerk? Didn't the good
voung governor make his nephew,
Hugh Buell, of Columbuus, deputy
of those he deceived, tho chief execu
Oil Inspector James M. Carr appoint
his own son, a student at Western Re
servo university, as n special deputy
In Cloveland at $1,200 a year? And
Isn't the brother-in-law ot Secretary
of State Charles Q. Hlldebrant hold
ing a chief clerkship under him? Go
to! Why pick on a poor woman?
o
In his mad chase for support in
1914, tho present head of tho stnto
government promised the autl-llood
protectionists In tho Miami valley
his support In repealing tho Vondcr
heldo conservancy act. When the
time came to dollver ho flunked and
the law stood intact, though fiercely
assailed. These facts en me from
members of the association which
fought tho law. Now It develops that
to protect hlmseir against the wrath
of those he deceived, tho chief execu
tive Is supplying assistance Indirect
ly. He has appointed the two chief
attorneys for the opposition to state
positions with good salaries. They
are Percy Taylor, of Sidney, member
of the state board of pardons, and F.
M. Sterrett, of Troy, legal assistant
of the state banking department In
the pending litigation these two per
sons, who are paid for their services
by the state, aro appearing in tho
courts on behalf of the organizations
opposed to tho Vonderheldo law. In
cidentally they are also campaigning
for the renomlnatlon and re-election
of the gentleman who gave them
their Jobs,
"We are advertised by our loving
friends" said Richmond In Shakes
peare's tragedy of Richard HI. Gov
ernor Willis can repeat it, but he
should add, "And they are being paid
at the expense of tho taxpayers.
Forty press agents, count 'em, forty t
"Attorney General Turner does a
big lot of ruling that gets Bmall at
tention," observes the editor man of
the Portsmouth Times.
"The last Willis legislature used
nearly 8,000 lead pencils, 1,183 pen
holders, 741 pairs ot scissors, and 29
pounds of rubber bands, according to
a report filed by State Auditor Dona
hey, with Governor Willis. Some
'economy in that legislature." Up-
per Sandusky Chief.
In discussing matters ot state.
Governor Willis exhibits lamentable
Ignorance. Even that Ignorance could
bo excused if the good young gover
nor did not parade It so noisily and
frequently.
