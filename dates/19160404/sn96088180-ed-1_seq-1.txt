STEEL CO, OPPOSES
ARMOR PLATE BILL
Washington, April 4. Beforo the
house naval committee today, repre
sentatives of the Bethlehem Steel
company made a final effort to pre
vent recommendation of the govern
ment armor plate bill being voted
President Grace promised that It the
United States should be involved In
war, or threatened with war, his
plant would furnish products at "any
price the government chooses to
pay." .. He further asserted his fac
tories would run 24 hours a day," it
necessary, to supply federal require
ments for armor plate. A promise to
manufacture armor plate Indefinitely
at any price tbe trade commission
might fix was likewise made
Grace said ho made the offers as
a matter of patriotism', and also with
a view to saving $7,000,000 which
had been Invested. The plant bad
previously offered armor plate at
$395 a ton for a period of five years.
It is doubtful whether these over
tures will provont government com
petition. IORP MAKES GOOD HACK

U. S. Ambassadors Tell the
State Department That For

America's Secret Messages
Berlin,' April 4. Ambassadors
Gerard and Penfleld and Minister
Van Dyke at Tbe Hague have joined
In a protest to tbe state department
against tbe continued use of the pre
sent American diplomatic code.
The state department at Washing
ton, replying to a recent United Press
dispatch from. Berlin stating that the
United States secret code was known
to several of the European belliger
ents, insisted that secret dispatches
could still be sent
"That Is what the department al
ways says," said an American offi
cial today, fully. in touch with the
situation. ."You'll find the code will
not be changed until It is too late."
' It was learned today that aa Amer
ican code book was stolen from an
attache of the American minister to
the Balkans ahortly before the out
break of the war. Secret service men
tried for weeks to trace it before the
loss was communicated to Welling
ton. It Is not known what belli
gerent posseses this volume, bnt
tbe American envoys are convinced
that every Important European power
can read not only the diplomatic but
the naval secret code.
About seven months ago an offi
cial mall pouch, carrying a highly
Important secret to the navy depart
ment front an observer In Germany,
was opened after it left London. The
secret report was unsealed and when
It reached Washington showed much
handling. In many ot the foreign
embassies, and legations, English,
French, German and other foreign
attaches have acted as American code
experts. It Is quite possible that
several men who have hana:ea the
American diplomatic code are now in
the. employ of European governments.

No Further Word of Fighting
in Mexico Has Come, and
More Troops Will Be Needed
If. Army Advances Further
Sad Antonio, April 4. Francisco
Villa is south of Parral, according to
a message received today from Con
sul Letcher, in Chihuahua City. Army
headquarters have had no word from
General Pershing for some time. No
reports of farther fighting have been
received.
Funston stated that lines of com
munication could not be maintained
much farther south without enorm
ously increasing the difficulties of
forwarding supplies.
Funston's statement was taken as
an indication that more troops would
be asked for If tbe expedition
marches farther into Mexico. He said
be would not dare move any more
men from the border, bnt if tbe militia-should
be called upon, he conld
nse the national guardsmen to re
place regulars on the (border patrol.
The present line of communications
is the longest ever maintained with
out ravishing the country traversed.
and it Is tbe longest in tbe history
of the United States army.
Antl-Carranslstas have burned two
bridges on the Mexican International
railway north of SalMnas, evidently
with the intention of isolating the
garrison at Monclova. These raiders
were reported to be a new faction, not
Villlstas. ' ' They also cut the tele
graph wires. ;

HEAVY SHELLS
IT THE FRENCH
London, April 4. Massed German
batteries on three aides of Bethin-
court are giving French positions a
terrific .bombardment today, and It
is feared the defenders will soon be
forced to evacuate their strongholds..
French successes at Vaux village
and the surrounding country were
not sufficient to offset the German
gain on a two-mile front northwest of
Verdun.
French positions west of the Meuse
are believed to be seriously en
dangered.
A heavy artillery battle continued
during the whole of yesterday on the
entire sector northwest of. Verdun.
For a week the Germans have been
shelling Hill 304. It Is the keystone
of the outer defenses in that dis
trict. .
German shells have crumbled Its
trenches and wrecked the French bat
teries stationed there.
Indications are that the Germans
plan to take Bethlnconrt and smoth
er French lines to the west under an
overwhelming attack, forcing the
French to retire to tbe shelter of tbe
first permanent fortifications of Ver
dun, near Esnes.
