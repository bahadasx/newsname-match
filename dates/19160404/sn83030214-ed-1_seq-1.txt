PREDICTS GERMAN DR1VE
AGAINST BRITISH FRONT
London, April 4. -The
Timrs's military correspon
dent in an account of his
\iMt lo Verdun predicts the
development shortly of ,t
l>ig batHc on the Britiah
front.
"Thr Germans." says the
correspondrnt, "have their
army distributed in two
great masses -one in front
of the British army and the
other around \erdiin. The
first group numbers 34 di
\isions and the latter 30 di
\isions. The rest of the line
in France is thinly held.
"from this distribution
one must suppose rither that
the Germans intend to at?
tack ihe British or expect
the British to attack them."

that. after all. the isaue was but the re- {
ault of his farseeing, deliberately laid J
plan*.
A host of things were now explamed,
including many of the odd, almost un
eaan* ineidentl that had befallen u*
in our dash that morning from Nami
qaipa toward BaehiBaba.
The general had ear',y d.^patched
from the latter town the BOOOt Brown
to Bachinaba. but by another road than
the orr? we were to take. Brown was
to loop westward through Santa Ana
and join u< there. A' he reaehed
ganta Ana he fell in with the two
native icoutl employed by (olonel :
Dodd. returning with the dispatches.

some hOBsVl where the two scouts';
homes were. They having had nothing1
to eat for three or four days, they were i
anxious to get home. But when they
reaehed our road we had already turned
back from that point, havir.g heard from |
r.atives that Dodd had left Rachinaba.
It had been a lucky move for u?, BB

TWO U. S. SCOUTS BNOAOE
BAND OF OUTLAWS IN FIGHT
Several Exchanges of Shots Occur Between
Americans and Villistas Near
Bachinaba Village.
By ROBERT DUNN.
(By wireless to Columbus, N. M.)
General Pershing's Headquarters, in tho Field, April 2.?
ESneounterillg a ftoting band of Villistas near Guerrero to-day,
American eavalry took up the pursuit. A running fight c.nsued.
No report as to the results has been brought here.
.\ motorcycle scout, returning from the Guerrero region
at 10 o'clook this morning, reported seattered firing north and
east of Guerrero village. It eame apparently from the same
detaehed foree of Villistas whieh yesterday drove two Ameri
ean seouts into a patio on the outskirts of Baehinaba, just west
of Baehinaba pass. in the Continental Divide, itself only some
ten or fifteen miles west of Guerrero. A fusillade at short range
followed for a brief period without casualties on either side.
The hunt for Villa has carried American troops into the
furthest recesses of the rugged country in this distriet of Guer?
rero, and General Pershing has been compelled to organize a
new detail of his force for mountain service where eavalry
eannot penetrate.
The General has taken for his model that wonderful bpdy
of the Italian army's bill scaling troops known as the Bersa
glieri. and the infantrymen of the Ameriean eolumn are going
through the hardest kind of field work. negotiating ridges and
ravines which mounted men never could cross or thread*
Toughening e.xereises, long hikes over old, twisting mountain
trails, and quiek jumps from arroyo to arroyo in thc jagged
stretches between Casas Grandes arul Namiquipa have pre?
pared an arm of Pershing's foree for reaehing into those remote
and hidden fastnesses whieh Villa knows so well and which he
has utilized so sueeessfully.
