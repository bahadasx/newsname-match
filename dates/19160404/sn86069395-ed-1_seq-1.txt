3 NIGHTS IN SUCCESSION
Berlin Tells of Raids and
Reports the Loss of
the L-15.
London, April 3. The coast of
Scotland and the northern and south
eastern counties of England were at
tacked by Zeppelins Sunday night,
according to an official announce
ment by the secretary of war. The
announcement says:
Zeppelin mid took place Sunday
night when the const of Scotland and
the northern and southeastern coun
ties of England were attacked.
Bombs were dropped at various
places. No details are available.
t least sixteen persons were killed
and about. 100 others injured bv the
explosion of bombs dropped m an
other raid of Zennelin diriuible bal
loons over the northeast const of Eng-
and Saturday night.
The official version of the raid says:
Two airships approached the north
east coast Saturday night. Only one
crossed the coast. The other turned
back.
For the present we know that six
teen persons were killed and about
100 injured.
Eight dwelling houses were demol
ished and a serious fire was caused in
a French polishing shop.
A correspondent in a northeast
const town says a Zeppelin dropped
fourteen explosive and seven incen
diary bombs there Saturday night.
Ten men, three women and three
children were killed and twenty-five
persons were seriously injured. In
addition, about eighty others received
minor injuries.
A tram car inspector was killed and
a woman tram conductor suffered the
loss of a leg. Several houses were
wrecked in one street. One house
was demolished, but the family of five
escaped without injury.
The total casualties reported in the
Zeppelin raid on the night of March
31-April 1 now amount to 43 killed
and CG injured. Nearly 200 explosives
and incendiary bombs were dropped.
a uaptist ctiapel, three dwelling
houses and two cottages were demol-
isiied. A town hall, four dwelling
houses, thirty-five cottages and a tram
car shed were partly wrecked. There
was no military damage.
With the exception of the big air
raid of January 31 when the casual
ties were sixty-seven persons killed
and 117 injured, the Zeppelin raids of
Friday and Saturday nights caused
greater loss of life than any previous
aerial attack this year. No details
are yet available regarding Sunday
night's raid.
The total casualties for Friday and
Saturday nights, according to an offi
cial report, were 57 persons killed
and ICG wounded.
As some compensation for the sac
rifice of life, however, tho nriii
public finds satisfaction in practical
proof afforded of a great improve
ment in the defensive methods dealing
with aerial incursions. For tho first
time since the inception of this meth
od of warfare on the British
not only has one raidintr Zennolin
been brought down and its crew taken
prisoners, but tho official rcnort re
counts an exciting aerial fight between
a Zeppelin and a British airman,
Lieut. Brandon, who, mounting to a
height of 9,000 feet, flew over tho
raider and dropped several bombs on
it with effect.
Tho machine- of Lieut. Brandon
was hit several times by machine gun
bullets from tho Zeppelin.
