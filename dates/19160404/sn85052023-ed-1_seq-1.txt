$2,000 EXTRA
FOR LINCOLN
Available from State-Aid Road Fund
Suggestions of Commission
for Bond Money.
Coiintv Road Engineer McKee
Hiffe and County Attorney W. S.
Burch were in Frankfort late last
week conferring with State Road
Commissioner R. C. Terrell in re
gard to the amount of state-aid funds
which are due Lincoln county for
the past year. At that, conference
with the state department head, they
received the gratifying news that a
larger sum than at first contemplated
will be apportioned to Lincoln coun
ty than was first estimated by the
state department. Instead of re
ceiving 9,000, Lincoln will receive
S11,000. The extra $2,000 will be
received as Lincoln's part of an ex
tra fund which accumulated by rea
son of the fact that a' number of
counties which had applied for state
aid did not meet the requirements of
the law regarding the securing of the
state funds, so that a surplus was left
to be divided among the counties
which followed out the law to the
letter. Lincoln county was one of
these, and her part of this extra fund
will be about $2,000, the State Com
missioner informed the local men.
Of course, it is required that Lin
coln county put up a like sum to
meet dollar for dollar the state-aid
money, and it is expected that every
effort will be made to ao so, as una
extra $2,000 from the state fund
-will go far toward improving roads
in the county. . .
Considerable talk is being heard
of the road bond question which will
come to a vote in Lincoln on May 13.
The suggestion has been made by of
ficials and others that in order to give
the taxpayers complete assurance
that every safeguard will be thrown
about the expenditure of their money
if they vote the $200,000 bonds in
the election, the Fiscal Court may
take advantage of the act of the re
cent legislature which gives to Fiscal
Courts the right to appoint a com
mission of private citizens to act
-with the court in planning the distri
bution of the bond funds, if voted,
upon the roads. The act .of the leg
islature which makes this provision
sets forth the powers of such com
mission, etc., and reads as follows:
An Act to enable Fiscal Courts of
any county to select commissioners
for the purpose of handling the pro
ceeds of any bond issue voted by the
county to build or reconstruct roads
and bridges.
Be it Enacted by ilie General Assem
bly of -the Commonwealth of Ken-
1, That the Fiscal Court of any
county in the Commonwealth may,
if it so desires, select or appoint four
or more commissioners who shall be
free-holders and legal voters and res
idents of said county, to act as a
Road Commission in the handling of
any funds derived from the sale of
bonds authorized and voted by the
said county for the purpose of build
ing and reconstructing roads and
bridges; and which commissioners
shall be equally divided between the
two dominant political parties of the
county. Said commissioners shall be
selected at least fifteen days before
the date of the election on the ques
tmn of the bond issue, and their
names published in some newspaper
of general circulation in the county;
and if none, by three printed notices
posted, one at the court-house door
and the other two at prominent
places in the county.
Provided however that in any coun
ty that has already voted a bond is
sue or shall vote a bond issue before
this act takes effect, and the bonds
voted have not been issued or sold
the Fiscal Courc mr.y elect to take
advantage of the provisions of this
act, and may appoint commissioners
herein provided for at any time with
out advertisement."
2. That in the event that the Fis
cal Court of any county does select
or appoint commissioners as afore
said that their duties in so far as the
building and reconstruction and des
ignation of roads to be built with the
proceeds of the bond issue shall be
identical with those now exercised
by the Fiscal Court. ' .
3. That before entering upon the
discharge of their duties said com
missioners shall each give a good and
sufficient bond, approved by the
county judge of the county, for the
faithful discharge of their duties, and
that the said commissioners shall be
allowed a reasonable sum for their
services by the fiscal court,, to be
paid by the fiscal court out of the
county levy for road and bridge pur
poses. 4. That further, commissioners
appointed under this act shall per
form their duties subject to the su
pervision.of the State Road Commis
sioner of the State Road Department,
should the county so voting bonds
take advantage of State aid or re
ceive funds from the State of Ken
tucky in building public highways.
5. Emergency clause. And where
as, there are a number of counties
in the state which desire to take ad
vantage of the State Aid Law, and
desire to hold elections under this
act, an emergency is declared to exist
for the passage of this law and this
law shall take effect upon its passage
and approval by the Governor.
Should Not Feel Discouraged
So many people troubled with in
digestion and constipation have been
benefited by talcing Chamberlain's
Tablets that no one should feel dis
couraged who has not given them a
trial. They contain no pepsin or
other digestive ferments but strength
en the stomach and enable it to per
form its functions naturally. Ob
, .taihable everywhere.
FINE FOR THE FARMERS
Hogs and Cattle Still On High Grade
Review of Situation.
Farmers and stock raisers are all
delighted with the way the stock
markets have been keeping up in
prices. A review of last week's
markets sent out from Chicago early
this week had this to say:
All stock yard values are being
maintained at phenomenally high lev
els. Cattle are selling at the pinna
cle of the year and some grades have
never realized as much money pre
viously. Ten-dollar prediction has
been redeemed and a large propor
tion of the steer crop has sold at
$9 9.75 than during any previous
March.
Hogs have reacted close to the high
point of the year, Canadian packers
paying $10.10 for bacon stuff last
week, while sales below $9.75 have
been very few. Lambs crawled up
close to the $12 mark last week,
$11.90, a record price having been
paid light stuff from Colorado feed
lots. An acute scarcity of aged
sheep has developed, carload lots of
wethers or ewes being rare, .hven
at this basis trade appears healthy
and killers are constantly compelled
to aid their needs.
A year ago cattle selling above $8
were regarded as specialties and
packers had access to acres of $7
7.75 steers. Such weighty bullocks
as are now in demand at $9.75 were
then hard to move at $7.75. Hogs
were then selling largely at $6.60
6.75, the top being 6.95. Lambs were
considered high at $9.90 and a $10
top was heralded far and wide, .bat
sheep sold at $7.75 against $9.25 at
present. Just six years ago, on a
semi-famine supply, hogs sold up to
$11.20, cost of packers' droves at
that time figuring around $11. That
market was made on the smallest, re
ceipts in a quarter of a century,
while the present $10 trade has been
possible on the heaviest run in trade
history.
COLORED COMMENCEMENT.
The annual Commencement of the
Colored High School of Stanford will

has been- a most successful one. The
graduates are Ophelia E. Logan, Jo
sephine S. Bright, and Virgie V.
Wood. The class colors are blue and
old gold and the class flower a Mare
schal Neil rose. The exercises at the

Miss Mamie Holtzclaw visited Miss
Essie Ballard in the Canaan section.
Messrs. Edgar Holtzclaw and "Lit
tle" Henry Lunsford have gone to
Hamilton, Ohio, in search of employ
ment. In the recent selection of theHon.
David R. Francis, of St. Louis, as
Ambassador to Russia, Richmond
grows boastful. Preaehersville, too,
can put up a modest- claim since his
father, the late Mr. John B. Francis,
at one time owned the Horton place
where old Kentucky hospitality was
dispensed and the young son, David
from St Louis, was frequently num
bered among the guests. Mr. Wm.
Pettus, the druggist, of Crab Orchard
and Mrs. James F. Cummins, of
Bellevue, Ky., late of Stanford, are
first cousins of the eminent St.
Louisan.
Woodson Carpenter has had a bad
time with his ear lately. While at
work handling brush, a twig fell back
and struck him in the ear bursting
the ear drum. We sympathize with
the young man in his loss. He has
had an injury to the other ear some
time ago and this will make it a se
vere hardship.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
From a small beginning the sale
and use of this remedy has. extended
to all parts of the United States and
to many foreign countries. When you
have heed of such a medicine give J
thamberiain s uough Kemedy a trial
and you will understand why it has
become so popular for coughs, colds,
and croup. . Obtainable everywhere.
YOUNGSTER LOOKS GOOD
Bill Reinhart Pitches Stanford to Vic
tory Over Hustonville.
The Stanford High School base ball
team opened the season here last Fri
day afternoon most auspiciously by
defeating the crack nine from the
Hustonville High School by a score
of 9 to 8. In winning this game,
Stanford uncovered a recruit pitcher
who bids fair to fill well the shoes of
the famous slabmen of the past, who
won fame and glory for the' old team.
The youngster is Will Reinhart, who
has just graduated from the kid
teams but showed that he has a world
of stuff on the ball and that all he
needs is a little experience to make
him able to hold his own in any com
pany. With a little better support
the kid would have made a much bet
ter showing on the occasion of his
debut, but it was the first game of
the season and the boys need a game
or two under their belts to put them
in first class trim. That the first vic
tory did them lots ot good was dem
onstrated the next day when the lo
cal lads went to Danville and de
feated the strong team of the School
for the Deaf by 12 to 6. Steve Do
zier, a veteran and John Cash, a
youngster catcher, were the battery
used against the Deaf boys. Young
Snoonamore, who caught Reinhart
Friday showed that he has the mak
ing of a first class backstop and like
his pitching partner will improve as
the season gets older.
McMullin, twirled a careful game
for Hustonville, and might have won
it, with decent support. The West
End boys, however, booted away the
game behind him time after time. The
game was very ragged on both sides
for that matter, and the next meetr
ing of these two teams with the
same men at the points ought to be
considerably better from many view
points. The line-up of the two teams
was as follows:

VILLA MAKES
HIS ESCAPE
After Uncle Sam's Soldiers Defeat
Larger Force of Bandits Near
San Geronimo Last Week
Officers at army headquarters at
San Antonio, Tex., are convinced
that Villa has escaped from the re
gion where Gen. Pershing's forces
are searching for him. Information
was received at El Paso to the effect
that the bandit, unwounded and ac
companied by only eight men, was
fifty miles south of Chihuahua City
three days ago and that he was lead
ing his pursuers by sixty miles. A
report from Pershing to Gen. Fun
ston made no reference to reports of
an encounter between American
forces and the bandits given in press
dispatches earlier in the day. A re
port several days ago of a fight be
tween forces of Gen. Cano and Villa
supporters indicates that he has not
revolted.
Villa's force, estimated at 500, was
severely defeated at Guerrero on
March 29 by Col. Dodd, commanding
one column of the American expedi
tionary force, according to a report
from Gen. Pershing to Gen. Funston,
sent from the San Geronimo ranch.
The Villa losses were placed at 30
killed and the American four wound
ed. Among the Villa wounded was
an officer named Lopez, who Gen.
Pershing thought might be Pablo Lo
pez, who led the band that murdered
17 Americans at Santa Ysabel and af
terwards was erroneously reported"
killed in the fight ac Columbus. Gen.
Eliseo Fernandez was among the
Villa dead. None of the Americans
wounded was seriously injured. Villa
was not present. Gen. Pershing said
that what was regarded as confirma
tion of the report that he was suffer
ing from a broken leg had been re
ceived. His exact whereabouts had
not been learned.
Col. Dodd led his Seventh and
Tenth Cavalry in a smashing ride
from the north toward Guerrero
when he learned of the presence
there of the Villa force, covering 55
miles in 17 hours. Gen. Pershing
said he arrived there at 6 o'clock,
going into action immediately. It
was a complete surprise to the Villa
force, which had entered into a cel
ebration of its victory over the Car
ranza garrison the day before. Soon
after the action began the Mexicans
were breaking for cover. For 10
miles the running fight that began

the retreating force into numerous
small bodies made pursuit impossible.
Col. Dodd reported that he had cap
tured two machine guns and a con
siderable number of saddles and ri
fles. The fleeing bandits left behind
several Carranza soldiers, who said
they had been held for execution.
They were released.

A MISSOURI OBITUARY
Here is the kind of an obituary
that a Missouri editor puts up for a
man: "Poor Jim Brown slung his
earthly garments on a limb and swam
the river yesterday. He didn't stand
back because the water was cold, but
plunged right in, rose up smiling,
struck out for the other shore where
the angels were awaiting him with
a finer suit than he had ever worn in
his life. Jim was a poor man but he
had his subscription to the home pa
per paid up and he has gone to
glory." Dade County (Mo.) Advo
