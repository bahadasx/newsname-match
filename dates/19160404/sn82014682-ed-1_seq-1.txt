' The Star-Bulletin received a cable

That a number of protests are be

has already been forwarded, it is un

ANDREWS WANTS
QUEEN STRICKEN
Lorrin Andrews, appointed by Judge
Stuart as guardian ad litem and "next
friend' of Queen Liliuokalani, moved
in argument held this morning,' to
strike out the demurrer and all mo
tions which Judge Antonio Perry had
filed as attorney for the queen. An
drews stated that it was his belief
that, inasmuch as he himself bad
been appointed as guardian to the
queen, no outside attorney could come
in and offer such papers to the court
Judge PePrry objected to the mo
tion on the grounds that it was am
biguous. He said that he did not
know whether his authority as, an at
torney actuallq appointed by the
queen was attacked, or whether it was
attacked on the grounds that the
queen, having appointed him, was in
competent to do so.
In efther case Judge Perry declared
that he would be glad to bring evi
dence to bear on the question. He
asked for a specific statement of the
motion and its reduction to, writing.
In Judge Whitney's court this morn
ing at 8:30 o'clock Miss Luc Ward
was called upon the stand again to
testify as to the sanity of the queen,
the specific time in question being
two years aeo at the floral parade
when Miss Ward had ridden r; the
queen's own hnrp. and had decorated
it with different trappings, so that the
queen had not known the horse later.
.ss Ward stated on the stand that
she had mentioned to G. Winkley,
bookkeeper for the law firm of Castle
& Withington, that she believed the
queen-was failing in health, but de
nied that she has said the queen's
mind was failing. ;
udge Stuart took Attorney Andrew's
motion under advisement, and was to
announce his decision this afternoon
at 4 o'clock. .

ASHFORD DENIES
MANDAMUS SUIT
BY GOLDWATER
Witnesses, testimony and appliances
brought into Judge C. W. Ashford's
court this" morning gave the usually
quiet and sedate confines the appear
ance of a young dental parlor, the case
on trial being the petition for a writ
of mandamus by Dr. Manuel Gold
water against the dental examiners.
Goldwater's petition for a dental
license on the grounds that Jiis ex
amination ' had not been fairly graded
was dismissed by Judge Ashford.
Two women, Mrs., Loughminer and
Mrs. Ochio, a Japanese, were brought
into the court and their teeth ex
amined for work which Dr. Goldwater
had done upon them. Dr. H. Clem
mens, another witness, went over Dr.
Goldwater's examination papers and
gave what he considered were , the
grades they deserved. He declared
the gold filling in Mrs. Ochio's mouth
to be worth practically 85 per Cent, on
the belief that there was not proper
"prevention by extension.'
Other phrases whose meaning in
general was unknown to the lay ear
entered into the discussion. These
included such terms as "caries, micro
organisims andorganic tissues."
The question of who was bearing
the expenses of the case, asked by
Attorney-General I. M. Stainback of
Dr. Clemmens, was objected to hotly
by George Davis, attorney for Dr.
Goldwater.
"What difference does it make to
you who bears the expenses?" cried
Davis as the question was put. "Who
paid for the Rapid Transit suit?"
Stainback intimated that he guessed
Davis had not paid much of it, Davis
maintaining that he had paid more
than Stainback.
Late in the case the petitioner's
counsel moved to amend the petition
so as to make the case operate as. a
suitto compel further examination on
the ground that the first examination
was not a proper one. The conrt
ruled against this petition, however.
There is talk of appealing the decision
to. the supreme court or of raising a
new case to provide for further exami
nation. Members of the examining board
were present this morning at the trial.
