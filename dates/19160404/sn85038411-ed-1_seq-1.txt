San Antonio, Texas. April 4.—Offi
cial admission of the belief that Fran
cisco Villa has fled" far "beyond the
American forces and now is operating
south of Chihuahua City was made at
General Fnnston's headquarters to
day.
Since yesterday, much information
indicating that the bandit was in the
neighborhood of Satevo moving to
wards Parral, has boon received but
that regarded by General Funston
and bis staff as most reliable came
from t'onsul Letcher at Chihuahua.
Tf it is proven tlmt Villa is on his
way south, perhaps toward Parral, or
Torreon, the campaign against him
cannot be carried much further un
less the railroads between Chihuahua
City and the border are made avail
able for the moving of troops to
strengthen the lines of communica
tion. This was frankly stated at Gen
eral Funston's headquarters where it
was also intimated that, representa
tions to this effect would be made to
the War Department.

(Heavy guards on trucks in Mexico.)
Grave apprehensions were expressed to-day by army officers for the safety of the American invading forces'
lines of communication.
Numerous warnings from confidential and usually reliable sources say that Villa adherents are gathering
in the chihuahua desert north and south of Ascension and near the motor truck trail leading from Columbus
to Casas Grandes.
The object, it is reported, is to cut the lines of communication, and, if possible, isolate and surround the
stations of American forces in Mexico. Additional troops have been sent into Mexico to prevent this.

ELEVEN HUNDRED
MEASLES CASES
SINCE MARCH 1
Caused More Deaths Than
Diphtheria; Greatest Epi
demic in History of City
GRAI)U AL L Y ABATING
Violation of Quarantine Laws
Largely Responsible Says
Dr. Raunick
More than eleven hundred cases of
measles—one of the worst epidemics
.in the history of the city—have been
reported to the City Health Bureau
since March X. Nine deaths were
caused by diseases resulting from
measles.
Because of the big epidemic, 1,117 I
cases of contagious ills were recorded |
during March, this year, making the
total for the first three months 1,660 |
—2 00 more than the total for the en- i
tire year of 1915.
Ninety-three cases of measles have !
been reported for the first three days;
of this month, but the epidemic is
now abating gradually, according to I
City Health Officer John 51. J. Rau
nick. In February 182 cases were
reported and in January, 7, making,
the total for the year to date 1,313.
Violation of quarantine, according,
to Dr. Raunick. was at first, responsible \
for the spread of the disease, which
reached its height the foutrh week of 1
March, when 349 cases were recorded.
Of the total, 1,021, the Tenth ward !
led with 182 cases: the Seventh was
second with 158: the Ninth, third, with
117. All of these wards are densely;
populated, however, and have a num
ber of school buildings in the terri
tories.
Measles with resultant other dis
eases so far, according to figures in
the Health Bureau offices, caused more
deaths last year and to date this year
than diphtheria. Contagious diseases
reported during March follow: Ty- j
phoid fever, 3: chlckenpox, 7: diph
theria. 7; measles, 1,021: German
measles. 3: whooping cough. 44; pneu
monia. 7: erysipelas. 6: mumps, 16; J
tetanus, 1; ophthalmia. 2.
Government Has Key to
Gasoline Problem Declares
Bailey in Development Bill
Special to the Telegraph
Washington, D. C., April 4. —That
there are over six million acres of
oil-bearing lands which the United
States Government might develop on
its own initiative, was asserted by
Representative Warren Worth Bailey,
of Pennsylvania, in connection with
the bill for government entry into the
oil business, introduced in the House
! yesterday.
"The gasoline situation is absolutely |
In the hands of Congress, 'said Mr. ;
Bailey. "It can solve the problem of |
extortionate nrtres at a stroke if it Is
so minded. T hope it will be so mind- ;
ed. Under the terms or my bill, the I
Secretary of thf Interior is authorized j
to proceed with new development of j
oil-bearing lands In the public domain.
There ar» over fi,000.000 acres of such
lands Tf the people want cheaper
gasoline Congress can Rive it to them '
right off the reel by puttinc my bill j
across. It is as simple as rolling oft a j
log."
After disposing of the matter in this |
manner, Mr. Railev talked to a num- j
her of members of the House and he '
said he found them "considerably in- |
terested in my proposal." He said he j
believed the Committee on Public j
I<ands would take kindly to his pro- j
posal. Mr. Bailey thinks that the'
mere prospect of the adoption of his j
plan will have the effect of "bring- 1
ins the oil monopoly up with a round j
turn."
State Wants City's
Firehouses in Park Zone
Removed by Jan. 1
Harrisburg was formally requested j
to-day by the Capitol Park Kxtension i
Commission to move .the Citizen and ]
the Mount Vernon firehouses from the
park extension zone by January 1,
1 01 7. and Council this morning turned
the communication over to Commis- !
sioner E. Z. Gross, superintendent of '
parks and public property.
The city released its property, in- i
eluding the streets, in the park zone !
November 16, 1911. The Mount Vei 1 - i
non frontage of 21 feet and the Citizen
frontage of 23 feet in Fourth street j
are among the huildings which the j
city gave over to the State.
The request for the razing of the |
two firehouses. however, aroused con
siderable conjecture in city quarters as j
to what will become of the companies ;
that are housed in that district. Com- j
missioner Gross said he couldn't dis- |
cuss the problem, as the matter hadn't !
nrogressed to that point. Tn certain !
firemen quarters, however, it is be- ;
lieved the two buildings will eventually |
lead to the. establishment of a central
fire station at the Hope and the pos
sible removal of some of the equip
ment. . of the two companies to the;
Camp Curtin or pther houses.

There is a slight lull in the battle

wood between Douaumont and Vaux,
and regained a footing in the village
of Vaux itself.
No Infantry engagements occurred
last night, according to the afternoon
Paris bulletin. The French artillery
has been notably active, however,
hammering German positions in the
Vaux-Douaumont sector. The Ger
mans are declared to have made only
a feeble response to this bombard
ment.
Northwest of the fortress the artil
lery on both sides have been actively
employed along the Avocourt-Alalan
court front, where ihe salient in the
line is gradually neing straightened
out by the southward push of the
Germans. Even from the adjoining
Argonne region, the German lines at
Ma.laricourt have been subjected to a

guns.
