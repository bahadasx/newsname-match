Naval Committee Brought Hear­
ings to a Close Build 6
Capital Ships.
Washington, April 3.—The house
naval committee brought to an end to­
day its prolonged hearing on the 1917
naval appropriations bill. Secretary
Daniels closed a three days' statement
before the committee with a final ap­
peal in support of the administra­
tion's five year prqgram. A sub-com­
mittee will begin framing the bill. It
became known tonight that a deter­
mined effort would be made to pro­
vide for six capital ships, two dread
naughts and four battle cruisers, as a
compromise between Hie recommen­
dations of the secretary and of the
naval general board.
Parried All Queries.
Mr. Daniels baffled all efforts today
•to gel from him a statement as to
what relative place among naval pow­
ers the United States should occupy.
Charges Loss, of secrets.
Rep. Butler of Pennsylvania, repub­
lican, assailed the secretary's recom­
mendation for a government projec­
tile factory. He asserted that the spe­
cification for navy armor piercing
shells were so high that they could
not be met by manufacturers and he
also declared he had reason to believe
the specifications for navy 14-inch
guns and other material had been re­
vealed during Mr. Daniels' adminis­
tration to the Russian and German
governments. He suggested that Rear
Admiral Strauss, ctuef of ortmance,
be asked to produce a letter to the
Krupp company of Germany.
Admiral Strauss was summoned lat­
er and read the letter in question^
ThTe letter.
"These are not the specifications of
our 14-inch guns" Admiral Strauss
said. "They are for a much superior
gun."
Both the secretary and the admiral
sa'id they had 110 knowledge of any
plans or other information having
been imparted to the Russian govern­
ment.
Rep. Britten, directed attention to
Admiral Fiske's statement that he
had resigned because he had differed

Letters Held

Asked His Friend Von der Goltz
to Secure Aid From the Ameri­

Wshington, April 3.—Photographic
copies of letters said to have been
written by von Papen, the withdrawn
military attache, to persons in this
country asking them to aid Horst von
der Goltz, the alledged German spy,
brought, to New York a week ago by
Scotland Yards detectives, are in pos­
session of the United States. These
letters,, it is said, were written at the
time Von ider Goltz was shaping plans
to blow up the Welland canal. One
was addressed to a gpvernment offi­
cial in this country and met such re­
sponse that Von der Goltz was able to
leave the United tates with an Amer­
ican passport issued to him under the
alias Bridgman Taylor.

TOJUELL IT
Large Crowd to Protest Against
State Aid to Religious
Schools.
Haverhill, Mass., April 3.—The lo­
cal company of the state militia was
called upon by Mayor Albert L. Bart
lett tonight to assist the police to
control a crowd of 5.000 people con­
cerned in a riotous demonstration in
the vicinity of the city hall. Many
windows in the building were broken.
The crowd assembled as a result of
an attempt to hold a meeting in the
hall for discussion of state aid for
sectarian schools. Tfiomas Leyden
of Somerville, who was announced as
a former Roman Catholic priest, had
been advertised as the speaker. When
the hour for the meeting arrived, the
crowd in front of the hall was so
dense that the police decided the
meeting could not be held and the
doors were closed.

No Changes

Practically complete returns on the
.republican ticket compiled by The
Tribune do not change any of the re­
sults in the recent presidential pri­
maries. Almost 1,800 precincts have
been heard.from and in each instance
the figures are official.
The returns on the democratic tick­
et for delegates are not quite so com­
plete, but it is safe to predict that
nine of the first ten enumerated have
been elected. There may be a change
in the tenth. F. O. Hellst'rom is eas­

DEFINE A POLICY.
Bismarck will be called upon to
vote for the issuance of bonds in the
sum of $50,000 to build another school
house. Most of the tax payers as
yet are completely in the dark as to
what the board contemplates doing,
should the proposed bond issue be
granted by the voters at the election
called for Wednesday, April 12.
It is time for the city to outline
some definite policy in its school af­
fairs. No one wants to be niggardly
in furnishing the best school facili­
ties for our boys and girls, but in or­
der to vote intelligently, it is imper­
ative that the school board issue a
statement outlining the proposed plan
of expending this money.
The issuance of $50,000 worth of
bonds means an additional outlay of
approximately $10,000 for equipment.
If the citizens are to assume this ad­
ditional tax burden, they should be
in full possession of the facts.
There is a pressing need for school
facilities south of the tracks, a dis­
trict that is growing in population.
Some of the money should be spent
in that section, making accessible
schooil facilities for children who are
now forced to go too far.
A fast growing section of the city
lying west of Second street and north
of Avenue A, should be afforded bet
tor school accommodations. If this
money were used to erect a $25,MM)
school south of the tracks and an­
other one somewhere north of Avenue
A and west, of Second street., people
living in these sections would be bet
ler served and conditions relieved at
the Will and North Ward schools.
It has been rumored that another
school will be built on the North
Ward school site. While this would
relieve congestion, such action would
not serve the various community cen­
ters as well.
Our schools now are poorly located
as regards the centers of population.
It would be foHw to construct more
schools at these centers. Getter
bring the schools closer to the pa­
trons than aggravate the unequal con­
ditions that, new exist.
In any event, the school board
should present its plan for relieving
congested conditions before the elec­
tion. Some survey of the situation
should be made and a policy outlined
before the expenditure is permitted:

London, April 3.—Having straight­
ened out their lines by occupying ah
the French positions north of Vorges
brook, between Raucourt and Bethen
court, northwest of Verdun, the Ger­
mans now are engaged in shelling the
region of the Bourrous wood, some
five miles northwest, of the fortress.
East of the Meuse, around Vaux,

wood, and in reoccupying 1 lit* western
part of the Village of Vaux, which
they hail previously evacuated.
The occupation by the Germans of
the Haucourl-Belhoneourl front, fol­
lowed a vigorous attack, in which,
however, the Germans met no foe,
I lie French having evacuated their
positions at night, without the Ger­
mans observing the movements. From
their hew positions south of the Vor­
ges brook and at Bethc-ncourt, the
French poured a direct and llanking
fire into the attacking Germans, who
suffered heavy casualties.
Along the remainder of the French
front, artillery bombardments have
nredominaied, although there have
been aerial combats near Verdun, in
which the Germans lost four aero­
planes and aerial raids by the French
on various German cantonments iu
Belgium.
Boats Were Torpedoed.
Accumulation by Hie state depart­
ment of circumstantial evidences, in­
dicating that the Sussez and other un­
armed merchant' ships have been at­

ably will make necessary a chance in
thf administration's olan for dealing
with the broad ouestion of submarine
warfare and the arming of merc^a^t
shins for defensive nurnoses. This
became known tonight after the state
deoarltnenf had announced 1he re­
ceipt of a dispatch which nnoted one
of the survivors of the Manchester
Engineer disaster as sayimr he had
seen the neroscope of a submarine.
Affidavits of Survivors.
Other dispatches received during
the dav brought the information t.liat
a number of affidavits from survivors
of the Sussex were being forwarded by
Ambassador sharp at Paris, that Am­
bassador Gerard at Berlin had been
promised an early reply to his in­
quiries regarding the Sussex, the Eng­
lishman and other ships, within a few
days.
Until a number of unarmed mer­
chant ships were overtaken with dis­
aster in the war zone, the United
States had planned to issue, for the
benefit of the belligerents, a complete
definition of its position regarding the
arming of merchant ships for de­
fensive purposes and the conduct of
submarine warfare.
The proposed statement, probably,
will be withheld until the facts con­
cerning the recent disaster are clear
ed up.
Germans Repulsed by Russ.
An attack by the Germans against
the bridgehead at Ikskull was repuls­
ed by the Russians. The usual bom­

Constantinople reports that the
Turks, strongly reinforced, have
checked the Russians' offensive in
the Caucasus region and that the Ot­

the upper Tchoruk and farther south
have captured a Turkish position and
dispersed Turkish cavalry detach­

Recriminations.
PAPER DECLARED
BOGUS BY DEFENSE
Complainant Made Loans of Sev­
eral Thousands to Youths
of 22 Years.
Minot, N. D.. April S1.—During one
of the tense moments at the You­
mans trial this afternoon. Senator
Purcell scathingly rebuked Attorney
James Manahan for "undignified,"
"disrespectful" and "discourteous" re­
marks toward Presiding Judge Knee
shaw. The audience' was on the
keen edge of expectation, looking tor
His Honor to administer a severe
reprimand to Attorney ..Ylanalian and
possibly accompany it with a stilT
tine. The judge hail told Attorney
iManahan several times to state his
objections before making his argu­
ment, and it was a! this lime that
the attorney for the plaintiff was told
hy the judge. "You are making a.
statement that is not true, so sit
down." Attorney Manahan look his
seat, but. rose in the I winkling of an
eye and, pointing hi- linger directly
at the judge, said, "I could character­
ize it in a moiv fitting manner in
another place. I never made a state­
ment that was not true."
Audience Enjoyed Tilt.
Senator Purcell characterized Man­
ahan as "Shanty Irish." However,
the judge maintained his dignity and
told Manahan in sii. down and re­
main sealed, and for the case to pro­
ceed. The large socialistic audience
.seemed to sympatic with Manahan

At one time, while the attorneys were
engaged in the war of words, a dem­
onstration was made by the audience.
This came when Francis J. Murphy
was questioning Mr. Youmans in re­
gard to a mortgage of $2,000 given by
one Jesse lOdison, which was sold
to the bank, endorsed by the Savings
Loan and Trust company, a Youmans
institution, without recourse.
"Throw Every Man Out."
Judge Kneeshaw rapped for order,
calling to the bailiff, and said, "Did
you see any person making a demon­

The judge said: "'Put him out

demonstration of that kind." One
bailiff, believing in "safety first,"
grabbed the smallest man in the au­
dience and rushed him out through
the door. These were but a few of
the many sensational thrills enjoyed
by the audience.
The testimony was much the same
today as on all previous days, with
Youmans in the' witness box giving
evidence in a very grudging manner,
which had to be thoroughly picked
out of him, piece by piece, by Attor­

III THE LARD CASE
E
United States Supreme Court
Sustains Ladd Label
Law.
BIG VICTORY FOR
LEGAL DEPARTMENT
Attorney (ienerai Linde won his ap­
peal yesterday in the lard case and
Justice Burke's decision upholding
the law is confirmed. This is the
last chapter in a legal battle that
commenced in 1911. The case was be­
gun under Attorney General Miller
and his administration fought the
case to the supreme court where upon
a close decision, the law was upheld.
Justice Burke wrote a strong deci­
sion upholding the power of the slate
to regulate such matters. His deci­
sion went to the vital issue the pow­
er of the state to protect its people
against fraud in the sale of food prod­
ucts. Victory for the defendant in
this case might have been an open­
ing wedge to undermine other feat­
ures of the pure food hiws of the
state.
The case is entitled the State
against Armour & Co., and the issue
turns on the provision of the law com­
pelling manufacturers to state on
their lard containers the true name,
grade of the product, the true net.
weight with the true name of the pro­
ducer or I he jobber.
The law also provides that lard sold
in pails must be put up in containers
holding one, three and five pounds
net weight or some whole multiple
of these numbers.
Armour & Co. held that the law
was unreasonable bccause the display
of the net weigh was sullieieni to
protect the consumer.
The supreme court holds that it is
within the police power of the state
to require manufacturers to put prod­
ucts up in even weights just as it was
to compel them to show net weights
under the old law.
Armour &. Co., appealed to the Unit­
ed States supreme court from this de­
cision and Attorney General Linde,
assisted by Francis J. Murphy and
Mr. Miller prepared the briefs which
yesterday won for the state this im­
portant decision.

MUST AWAIT DECISION
ON DISPUTED POINT
Aubrey Lawrence, representing the
Dakota Trust company, secured from
the United States supreme court a
temporary order restraining Insur­
ance Commissioner Taylor from or­
ganizing the state bonding depart­
ment, pending the appeal from thft
stale supreme court which upheld tile
bonding bill.
The bill was attacked on the
grounds of unconstitutionality. It
was urged that the bill caused an im­
proper diversion of public funds and
a number of other constitutional ques­
tions were raised.
After the supreme court sustained
the law, Ihe attorneys for the trust
company served notice of appeal and
asked Attorney Linde to agree to a
stipulation of facts and a suspension
of the operation of the act until the
federal court decided the issue. Mr.
Linde stated that lie would not do so
unless Insurance Commissioner Tay­
lor consented. The latter refused to
do so and then the supreme, court was
appealed to. Chief Justice Fisk re­
fused to issue an order suspending
the operation of the act until adjudi­
cated, in the federalkcgyrjt.

Washington, April :t.—Evidence of

the American forces hunting Villa ap­
parently disposing finally of rumors
that Col. Cano and his command had
deserted to Villa, came to the war de­
partment late today from Gen. Per­

Cavalry Foraging Fo^ThWIWtiv^
That some supplies an4-fora#s
the cavalry, even if of poor quality,
were being obtained "off of the coua
try" by Gen. Pershing's forces was
another encouraging feature of tthe
report. The general said corn of in­
ferior quality was plentiful, and beef
cattle had been secured.
The American consul at Monterey,
advised the state department that ex­
citement there, following the Colum­
bus massacre and entrance of Amer­
ican troops into Mexico had complete­
ly subsided.
All Quiet Along Coast.
Navy department dispatches report­
ed all quiet on both east and west
Mexican coasts.
iRumors that the Washington gov­
ernment would object to sales of mu­
nition by foreign countries to the d«
facto authorities were formally de­
nied at the state department. It was
pointed out that the United States
was selling such supplies to Carraasa
and would not be in a position to ob­
ject to similar action by another na­
tion.
Henry f. Fletcher, newly appointed
American ambassador to Mexico, con­
ferred for a short time today with
Secretary Lansing. No definite date
for his departure to Mexico has been
set.
Feared Villa's Escape.
The fear expressed yesterday at
army headquarters that Francisco
Villa had escaped from the regions
in which Gen. Pershing's colunms are
operating became a conviction at the
close of today. Gen. Pershing's re­
port received this afternoon contain
ed the news that at least a part of
the dispersed Villa force that was
driven from Guerrero March 29 still
was moving in the district northeast
of that place, but no mention of Vil­
la's whereabouts was made. The re­
port was dated yesterday. No refer
ence was made of an encounter that
was mentioned in dispatches from the
front, information gathered from var­
ious sources and confirmed by Gen. 1
Pershing intimated that the intelli­
gent officers of the punitive expedi­
tion were having to contend with the
receipt of unreliable informtttion lib­
erally supplied in districjts through
which Villa and his followers

a question for Gen. Pershing's scouts
to answer. It was pointed out at
Gen. Funston's headquarters that

troops would resume the chase into
the interior, although it was realised
that this second phase of the punitive
expedition's work would be far
