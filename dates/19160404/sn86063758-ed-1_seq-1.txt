A Romantic Marriage.
Snmo time a?o The Herald and

the marriage of Mr Pat Livingston and
Miss Adelaide Swain, the ceremony
being performed by Rev. J. L. Thomas
of Lexington. Under the above head
the following notice lias been sentj
The Herald and News:
Miss Evelyn. Swain and Mr. S. D.
Shepparrl were married clandestinely i
March 5th, at Lexington. S. C., by Kev
L. A. Thomas. The contracting parties
in tended to keep their marriage a sec- i
rot till fall but somehow, it became
known to some person here and thp
news spread like "wild-fire." So a?
x> stop folks from guessing they have
decided to give their secret to the public.
This was a doubly romantic affair
as the two sisters Misses Evelyn
and Adelaide S\rain were married at
the same time.
/ Here's hoping that their lives may
j be long happy dreams.unruffled -by
the slightest ripple o? sorrow or re
gret.

OFR FIRST SUNDAY
IN JACKSONVILLE
Leaving home Tuesday morning,
darrli 21. 10 a m., arriving in Cclum'
in S C . late, had only few minutes
to get to Seaboard station to connect
with train consisting of Pullmans airl
day coach, all steel and up to no?.coaches,
it being through tourist train
from New York to Jacksonville. It
was a very windy day and the land
between Columbia and 'Savannah had
been plowed and the dust was simply
fierce. Many times you could scarcely
see a hundred feet from the train.
Xearing 'Savannah I noticed the yellow
jessamine in bloom, indicatng the
' r\ T^rAo / .V> rvf cnriner P.af Qoron

nah and Jacksonville there was moss. I
woods and swamps. The dust was not
so bad the wind was till 'blowing
hard and a:> night fame on we passed
through marshy places, where the forest
was 011 tire, fanned by the high
winds, burning in a zig-zag way running
up an occasional dead tree setting
trunk of tree and limbs on fire,
making a-glare that lit up all around, j
and from the train in motion it was a
beautiful sight. Foliage on the trees
much larger than in our section, the
forest I notice bordered with an occasional
dogwood tree blooming. Arriving
in Jacksonville a little late, I
bad no trouble in finding my new:
liome.
Sunday I went to Methodist cliurch
wtih a friend. The minister, although
a young man, preached two good sermons.
morning and evening. When he
spoke of David tuning his harp and
singing the good old Psalms. The Lord
\Tv QVipnhprt- 1 1T Ynr Want alsn
refering touchingly to Luther. Knox,
Wesley. 'John the Baptist, etc, the
soft tones cf the organ, the choir
commenced singing one of those good
old Methodist tunes, I must dry my
eyes, because they were very watery.
The city is full of visitors going
home, many of them and many distinguished
peop'e are here andpassing
through, such as Thomas Edison and
wife. Mr. Gould, president Cornell university.
the editor of Manufacturer's
Kecord, etc. Don't know about them
until I see it in morning paper. Jack
aonville has about one liundred thousand
inhabitants and has to handle
more Pullmans than any Southern
city, it is an interesting slgnt to visit
the unon station about 7 oclock, trains
coming in from Tampa, Key West, etc.,
and trains preparing to leave out for
the North and Northwest, see the tourists
with their baggage, maids, children.
etc., all pushing and mixing up
getting tickets, and it reminds me of
our South Carolina fair, and then the
man begins to call out the trains, their
destination, and points they reach and
it makes me think of the darkies in
Charleston. S. selling their produce.
etc., you can hardly understand
anything they say.
I have many good friends in Prosperity
and Newberry county who will
likely appreciate tliis scribbling letter.
I see from The Herald and News
many of my friends coming out as
candidates for the various office*. I
wish I cou'd vote for them by proxy.
Closing for this time, I am-,
Yoprs truly .

DR. HOUSE AL VISITS
SCENES 0^ OTHER DAYS
Dr. W. G. Houseal had a call thei
other day to ?ee a patient near Dyson,
in Greenwood county. Mrs. HouseaL
concluded she would like a trip like
j that and she decided that in order to?
| to go with the doctor and so did their
j son Gustof. and he decided that in orj
der to take the trip he would rffe im
the foot of the car, as the doctor is*
driving a Ford runabout.
They left Xewberrv about 1:30
o'clock ana reached the home of the
patient a little after 3 o'clock. After
spending about an hour with the patient
they started on the return trip*
and decided to come back by Greenwood
as this trip would give the doc
tor an opportunity to pass the old
school house where he taught school
V
in 1 SSI and where he made the first
money to begin his study of medicine.
It is the school house near by the old
home of the editor an-d where we went
to school in the days gone by. The
house still stands and looks very t
much as it did when Dr. Houseal
taught the school. And then a little
further on is the old home of Wm. .
Haltiwanger where the doctor board'
ed while teaching the school. Tht

after 6 o'clock. The return tripwas
made via Ninety Six and Island
