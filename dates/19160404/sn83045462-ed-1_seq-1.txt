Douarimont and in the Caillaux
wood, northeast of \'erdun. have
been taken by German troops, the
German war office announced today.
Recapture by the British
of a mine crater at St. Kloi. south
of Ypres, which the Germans had
been occupying, is also admitted
in the official statement.
There is a slight lull in the battle
raging around Verdun, following
the violent fighting of yesterday,
by which the French pushed
their way back to the northern
outskirts of Caillaux wood between
Douaiimont and Yait.v and
regained a footing in the 'village
of Yaux itself, according to Paris.
The French artillery has been
notably active in hammering German
positions in the Yaux-Douaumont
sector. The Germans are
declared to have made only a

Northwest of the fortress the
artillery on both sides has been
actively employed along the Avocourt-Malancourt
front, where the
salient in the line is gradually being
straightened out by the southward
push of the Germans. Even
from the adjoining Argonne region.
the German lines at Malancourt
have been subjected to a
pounding by the French longrange
guns.
Berlin Reports Gain.

Gain in Counter Attacks.
"East of the Meuse our counter attacks
developed success. In the course
of the day we drove back the enemy as
far as the northern outskirts of the
t'aillette wood and to the north of the
Vaux pond. A last counter attack, particularly
spirited, enabled us to reoccupy
the west part of the village of

British Face Battle.
The Times military correspondent
in an account of his visit to Verdun
and the French front predicts the development
shortly of a big battle on
the British front.
"The Germans." says the correspondent.
"have their army distributed
in two great masses?one in front of
the British army and the other around

I thirty-four divisions and the latter
thirty divisions. The rest of the line
in France is thinly held.
"From this distribution one must
suppose either that the Germans intend
to attack the British or expect
the British to attack them."
German Statement.
The German official statement of today
reads:
"After powerful artillery preparation
1 the British have taken possession of
the crater south of St. Eloi which we
took from them the 28th of March.
"In the region of the fortress of
Douaumont our troops, after bitter
fighting, captured, April 2, some strong
French defense positions southwest
and south of the fortress and in Caillette
wood. They repulsed from the
captured positions all the enemy's
counter attacks, which continued into
the night. Employing exceedingly
strong forces and at the cost of extremely
heavy sacrifies, the French repeatedly
and fruitlessly stormed the
defense positions, which they had lost
in Caillette wood.
"During our attacks April 2 we captured
in unwounded prisoners nineteen
officers and 745 men and eight machine

Will Run for President Upon

Jurist Thought Willing if Convinced
Republican Success Is Possible
With No Other Candidate.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
''Mr. Justice Hughes will accept
the republican presidential
nomination if it comes to him
without protest and is tendered
on the ground that his party considers
him the man most likely
to wrest control of the govern!
ment from the democrats."
This statement embodies the
j opinion of important men in the
republican leadership. Thus far
i no man lias been authorized to
; quote .Mr. Hughes or to attribute
; directly to him pronouncement to
such effect.
No Direct Proof at Hand.
By th?? samp token, no man can say.
nor has Mr. Hughes said, that in no
circumstances will he accept the nomination
should it come to him.
In is conviction, wunuui uireci prooi,
upon which the statement rests and
| today is accepted by republican leaders
as a ttr.aiity. This accounts for the
| tremendous increase in Hughes senti{
ment in the past few weeks. Word has
? been passed around.
{ It is said by politicians who have
sounded the situation that in acceptj
ing the nomination Mr. Hughes would

His choice would be to remain
I on the bench. Chief Justice White and

j m the opening paragraph of this chapj
ter Mr. Justice Hughes is profoundly

and international interest of
this country demand that the republican
party shall take over the government.
He is said to feel that the democratic
party is inept in legislation and weak
; and vacillating in administration. He
! does not. it is explained, arrogate unto
! himself superior wisdom as an adj

CIVIL PENSION BILL
IS TO BEREPORTED
Senate Committee Members
Predict Measure After Their
Meeting Today.
m/ii i cm i nui tuc i imco
URGED BY MR. POMERENE
Ohio Senator Says Contributory
Flan Will Be Adopted Rather Than
Full Government Contribution.
That a civil service retirement
and pension bill will be reported
to the Senate from the committee
on civil service and retrenchment
in the near future was the prediction
made by members of that
committee today, following a
meeting at which the subject was
discussed at some length. i
The bill undoubtedly will be framed
along: the lines laid down in the bill
introduced by Senator Fomerene of
Ohio, chairman of the committee, last
January, which provides for a contributory
plan by which the employes of
the government will have a fraction
of their salaries retained by the government
to finance the pension system.
This measure is similar in many
respects to the bill which was reported
by tne committee wnen aeuawr cummins
of Iowa was chairman. The Iowa
senator is at present a member of the
committee and much interested in the
proposed legislation.
To Follow Contributory Plan.
Senator Pomerene said today he felt
sure any bill which was reported would
be along the contributory-plan line;
that he did not believe a straight pension
plan would receive any material
support in the committee, and that a
straight pension plan?by which is
meant that the government*will furnish
all the funds for the pensionswould
be frowned upon by the people
of the United States generally.
"I have been in consultation with an
actuary over certain features of the
retirement system proposed," he said,
"and I expect to obtain considerable
data from him. As soon as this is in
hand another meeting of the committee
will be called, and I hope we may
get action soon "
If the bill is reported to the Senate
it will then go to the calendar, and
Senator Pomerene will call it up at the
earliest opportunity. If this does not
occur at the present session, owing to
the important national defense measures,
the appropriation bills, the government
ship purchase bill and other
similar measures which are pressing
for action, the bill will occupy a strategic
position when the Senate meets
next December and can be taken up and
acted upon at that time.
General Hearings Unlikely.
Senator Pomerene said that he did
not believe there would be any general
hearings on the subject of the need of
a retirement and pension system for
the civil employes of the government.
He said this matter had been covered
fully in other hearings, and there
seemed nothing new to develop. That
the committee might give hearings on
special features of the bill he regarded
; as likely.
Senator Cummins, the ranking republican
member of the committee, expressed
the belief that a hill would be
reported to the Senate before long.
'r"1- ' Drooi.larit ami r? f his
| cabinet have given it as their opinions
that a civil service retirement law
should he enacted, not only for the
! benefit of the employes, but also as an
. economic advantage for the governi
inertt itself.
TOLEDO CAR SITUATION
MAY BE 110 TODAY"
Settlement Likely to Come
Through Application for Naming
of Receiver.
TOLEDO, Ohio. April 4.?Toledo's
street car situation may be settled today
and cars put in operation through the
i receivership application filed by the city
I yesterday. Federal Judge John M. Kilj
litts this morning began hearing argu!
ments why the Toledo Railways and
| Light Company should not be placed in
the hands of a receiver. Some definite
action on the receivership was expected
today.
An order issued today by Judge Killits
will continue to tie up operation of Toledo
street cars at least until Thursday.
! Because of differences between the company
and its employes over the wearing
I of union badges no cars have been run
j for a week.
Given Time to Answer.
| Judge Killits gave the Toledo Railways
|and Light Company until 10 o'clock
Thursday morning to file an answer to
the city's application for appointment of
I a receiver for the company.
I From the bench the judge said there
appeared to be every reason for a receiver
since the company and its men
are in apparently hopeless deadlock.
Henry L. Doherty submitted to the
judge an informal statement in the history
of tie-up. Mr. Doherty said in substance
as controlling director of the cotn
pany he would neither oppose nor urge
appointment of a receiver.

W. B. Richards, Efficiency Engineer,
Denies Underground
Opposition to Measure.
SAYS THE STOP WATCH
IS BENEFIT TO WORKERS
Never Knew Any One to Break
Down Under the "Speeding Up"'
Syitem.
That there is no lobby or underground
wire pulling connected with the
attempt to defeat the Tavenner bill,
forbidding employment of the Taylor
efficiency system in government plants,
was made plain today by Wt B. Richards
of New York, an efficiency engineer,
and secretary of the engineers'
committee of ten. Mr. Richards testified
today before the committee, under
a brisk cross-examination, much of the
time from Representatives London of
New York. Smith of Michigan and
Nolan of California, and also, in an interview
with a Star reported, quoted
Thomas A. Edison, "the dean of American
inventors." as saying the Tavenner
bill "is an attempt to prevent
efficiency and would be disastrous to
labor and the public."
Mr. Richards brought out clearly his.
idea that the stop watch, against which
labor organizations have battled strenuously.
is but a small part of the new
methods of scientific management. In
his interview later he said:
Penalty on Efficiency.
"I think it may be safely said that in
the opinion of the engineering profession
and the manufacturing world the
Tavenner bill could be properly entitled
'A bill to penalize efficiency in
the public service.' It undertakes to
make a criminal of every officer of the
United States who uses in a public
establishment those methods which in
thousands of private plants and in the
^ arsenals controlled by the War Department
have demonstrated over a period
of years their unquestioned capacity
at once to decrease the cost of production
and increase the wages of employes.
As Thomas Edison, the dean of
American inventors, says of the meas)ure,
'It is an attempt to prevent efficiency
and would be disastrous to labor
and the public.'
"Yet if Congress can be persuaded
to make it a crime to decrease at once
the public tax burden and increase
the earnings of government workers
by premium rewards for superior
n merit, the engineer and manufacturer
11 who employs the same method ip private
establishments will likewise become
a criminal in the opinidn of tht
public.
Purpose of Committee.
"It is to call the attention.of Con- .
gress and the public to this vicious
proposal to condemn efficiency and
penalise progress that a committee of
n ten was spontaneously organized in
1_ the engineering profession to spread
information of the nature and consel*
quences of this measure among the
public and our legislators. To that
end our committee has a public
c appeal for Jund's to prepare and distribute
educational-literature and permit
the presentation of our judgment
and evidence to the committees and
members of Congress, that they may
not be unadvised as to the meaning ot
[*- | this effort to make criminals of public
officers who endeavor to better the
C public service by employing the most
advanced methods known to the busik
* ness world.
"If this appeal to our fellow citizens
and to our lawmakers to prevent the
?_ condemnation of the most progressive
knowledge and skill by statute is rep(1
' rehensible. then we confess to no proper
conception of either our rights or
our duties as American citizens."
The suggestion of a "lobby" was
2 made to the committee recently by
Representative Tavenner. who presented
a letter to a Washington man
r from Mr. Richards. Representative
Tavenner said afterward he had not intended
to make so deep an impression. '
Partnerships for Workers.
In his opening statement before the I
committee on labor, Mr. Richards said
that he had been an adviser to the Taft |
economy commission. I
^ ?
1 "To legislate against the bonus plan, J
J is to legislate against a workman
forming a partnership connection with '
his work. To give a man a reward is a
- practical partnership, one that he car
within reason control. It is a fallacy
to believe that a bonus plan for a work- 1
man goads him beyond his powers. It
does not drive him. In fact, he can be ,
driven harder under the straight dailywage
system." He said that he did not
especially recommend the Taylor sys- 1
2 tern of scientific management, but that j
there is a broad new science in shop
management which has for its end the J
- increase of the output of factory or .
y shop. He said he had never seen men ,
breaking down under it.
;ur. niinaiuo c*. .-ijjii iicu ucunir as
y to the general effect upon mankind at
y large, assuming that scientific manage- j
,f ment goes its limit. Representative
[London, the one socialist representative .
in the House, took the view that the
- human family would suffer, while Mr. i
Richards held strictly to the tenet that
the workman's family would be the
gainer?if the bread winner had the
benefit of a scientific,shop management
0 system where he received a bonus for
extra work done. The*socialist congressman
took the extreme case of a factory '
3 where scientific management would *
f raise the efficiency of workmen so high \
s that of a thousand men only 400 were t
_ needed to do the work after the scien- a
s Ufic management had been applied: c
"I Goir't expect the United States to a
? employ a thousand men to do the work j
" of 400," replied Mr. Richards: "and.
furthermore, men don't have the right r
feeling about working for a concern t
on the down grade."
e Necessity for Stop-Watch. r
In a colloquy with Representative j
Smith of Michigan Mr. Richards said j
1 that the stop watch is a necessary eleS
ment in obtaining accurate data on the f
h cost of production, and that no shop I
f can do business without knowing its *
- costs. s
1 "The stop watch does not increase c
production," he said several times; "It .
I, merely is a small part or a cost ays- 'r
r tem."
n Representative Smith drew a paralt
lei between the workman under a sci1
entitle management system and an
L 'overworked horse. Mr. Richards ree
turned with the statement that the c
i bonus and premium systems gave work- c
d men more money for luxuries and made J
- life easier for them,
r "It is not necessary." he said, "to
Y hold a watch on a man to give him c
v a premium., but it is necessary to determine
the "cost of his work." , i

OUTLAW MOVING SOUTHWARD
Trail Well Covered for Time Being,'
and Army Finds It Necessary to
Extend at Once Its Coarse
of Operations.
TORREON". Mexico, April 4.?
Gen. Canuto Reyes, commanding
the Villa forces in this locality,
has sent a letter to Gen. Trevino,
Carranza commander, offering t<>
surrender with all his forces if
given amnesty. This information
was given out today by Gen. Trevino.
Carranza authorities here say
that the surrender of Reyes would
break organized resistance to the
de facto government and end the
hopes of Villa. There is a disposition,
however, to accept his
offer conservatively, as it was declared
that six weeks will be
necessary for Gen. Reyes to notify
all his followers, and there is
a possibility that this may be a
ruse to gain time for Villa.
With Francisco Villa still in flight
and his whereabouts apparently unknown
to his pursuers, the campaign
of the American forces, now scouring
northern Chihuahua for the bandit, entered
today upon a broader phase.
New troops have been ordered into
Mexico from the military base at Columbus,
-N. M.. to protect the lengthening
line of communications.
Army men here believe that as Villa
moves southward, with his trail well
cohered for the lime at least, it will
be necessary to establish new army
bases and guard strongly the line of
communications. I^arge reinforcements
of American troops will be needed, the
military authorities say.
Meanwhile the use by the American
army of the Mexico Northwestern railway
for the transportation of supplies
becomes more important.
Believed Heading for Torreon.
lucre is nine question any longer on
the border that Villa is heading: for
Torreon. in the neighborhood of which
city he will find Canuto Reyes, one of
his most trusted lieutenants. Reyes
has successfully defied the Carranza
forces for several months. He has ravaged
North Durango and is believed to
have several hundred men in his command.
with many smaller guerrilla
bodies operating in conjunction with
him. If Villa can effect a junction with
Reyes sufficiently in advance of his
pursuers to attempt a concentration of
the bandits, it is said that he can
muster 2.000 men at least.
Both Mexicans ana Americans who
know Villa personally have little doubt as
to the tactics he is trying to pursue. They
say that the fguitive bandit is not
alarmed over any opposition he may meet
from his countrymen, but that he is devoting
all his energies to planning the discomfiture
of the American forces, whom
be fears almost as much as he hates. According
to these observers Villa is anxious
to push as far south as possible, with the
purpose of stretching out the already thin
lines of communication of the Americans
to the breaking point. With the comparatively
few men under command of Gen.
Pershing a line of communication 400 or
500 miles long becomes a serious problem.
500 Miles South of Border.
Tdrreon is 500 miles from Columbus as
the crow flies, but a far greater distance
by the winding trails that are the only
*oads across northern Chihuahua.
The free use of'the Mexican railroads
for the transportation of both men and
supplies would, of course, upset Villa's
calculation and immensely simplify
3en. Pershing's problems. Army ofIcers
here make no secret of their beief
that some arrangements with the
ie facto government for the use of
-ailways will become imperative if it
iroves true that Villa has outdistanced
lis pursuers in his flight south.
While Mexican bullets have not taken
he life of a single soldier in the
\merican expeditionary forces and
lave wounded only four, the Mexican
dimate has been more inconsiderate.
Sick Troopers Brought Back.
In the neighborhood of 150. sick
American troopers have been brought
jack from the front, suffering from
arious ills due to the climatic condiiorvs
of the Sierra Madres. Eighteen
irrived yesterday. To date two have
lied. Lieut. Joseph W. A. Allison and
l private. Jesse P. Taylor, both of the!
3th Cavalry.
The base hospital at Fort Bliss in nornal
times provides ample facilities for
he treatment of eighty men. Since the
xpedition In Mexico began its resources
lave been overstrained. An entire barracks
next door has been transformed into
i hospital. There is an overflow in the
solation hospital and three additional
javilions are crowded.
Soldiers who are unable to bear the
train of mountain campaigning, who sufer
from fever and dysentery-, are brought
ack from the front in motor trucks to
^olumbus and sent to El Paso by train.
Tntil recently they were taken from the
tation here to Fort Bliss in trucks. Re
ently, however, ambulances have been
irovided. Most of the men grow better
apldly after their return.
