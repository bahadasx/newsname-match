BULLETIN,
Special 8tar-luUetia Cablel
WASHINGTON, D. C, April A
Vaughan, Robertson, Quinn and Whit
ney were confirmed by the senate this
evening.-
C. 8. ALBERT.
James Wesley Thompson appointee
of President Wilson as judge of the
third circuit court, island of Hawaii,
.is not to be confirmed without local
protesL . V--- 1
The Star-Bulletin received a cable
gram this morning bringing first def
inite news from Washington of the
tight to be made on the Thompson
nomination.; The cablegram follows:
"WASHINGTON, D. C, April 4.
The nomination of Thompson has been
suspended because of a cablegram re
ceived by the judiciary committee say
ing that protests against his confirms
tion are en route. These are expected
soon. Action Is unlikely until the com
plaints are Investigated.
-C. 8. ALBERT."
That a' number of protests are be
ing made Is the Information received
by the Star-Bulletin. One of these
lias already been forwarded, it Is un
derstood, by the Kohala Civic Associa
tion, signed by fifteen members. The
Kohala folk, ft is said, are basing
their protest both on the excellent
service given for many years by Judge
Matthewman of this circuit and ,also
ra the allegation that Attorney Thomp-'
eon is not capable of satisfactorily fill
log the position to which he has been
appointed. : , -. : V- V .,''
Other protests are stated to have
been sent forward. It is presumed
that the cablegram, asking for delay
has been sent by. representatives of
the Kohala association.
. The Bar Association has taken no
action nor is action contemplated, so
far as could be learned today. Secre
tary E. White ' Sutton said that the
executive committee held a meeting a
few days after the nominations were
sent In to the senate by the president,
but that it was decided to take no ac
tion on the Thompson appointment
Information from Washington la
that the other judicial appointment!
are all beta? passed upon . favorably
and confirmation of these should be
rapid. .
I haven't the slightest Idea as to
what resident or-residents of Hono
lulu have protested against my ap
pointment as judge, Mr. Thompson
said today, when informed of the con
tents of the Star-Bulletin's cablegram.
Mr. Thompson this afternoon stated
that he understands certain people on
Hawaii wanted action on his appoint
ment deferred until Circuit Judge
John A. Matthewman decided the Wai
mea water case. This decision was
handed down last Saturday. It is un
derstood that Attorney-General I. M.
Stalnback has tent a cable to the sen
ate judiciary committee informing it
of the .decision.

Nearly all of the districts and coun

exception of Tseungt-ha, have fallen
into the hands oi the southern troops,
opposing Yuan Shih-Kai. - Cheung--king-in,
commander of the Seventh Di-

Szechuen to oppose the progress of
the revolutionists, has been killed in
action after meeting with defeats
which greatly diminished his troops.
Peace Plana Hopeless.
Chasai-cheong, present minister of
internal affairs for the Yuan govern

provinces in the north saying that
plans for conciliation are hopeless. He
has requested that the governors of
all the provinces in Yuan's power take
steps to defend their territories and
not Join the southern troops, or revo

The commander of the government
troops In.the Kwongtung province fled
to the gunboat Hoichan for protection
after he had been threatened by. the
revolutionists. Half of his troops
have surrendered to and joined the
Kungwo body of rebels, the other half
having fled in disorder. Negotiations
are now being pressed whereby a 14
day armistice may be agreed upon be
tween the rebels and Yuan's troops.
After he had been advised to resign
from the presidential chair. Yuan
telegraphed to Peking and suggested
the drawing up of peace articles,
whereby the north and the south
would again be united. One of these
messages went to Hong Yoa Wal, lead
er of the Tsun-pu Tang or Progres

his influence, it is reported, that the
present revolution in China was
brought about. Many of his pupils
and fellow party men now are leading

Yuan Won't Resign.
(Special Cable to Nippu Jiji.)
TOKIO, Japan. April . Yuan Shih
Kai his olflqially announced that he
does not propose to retire from the
presidency of China, as he feels that
it is his duty to maintain order in that
country. In a statement today Yuan
said that if; be resigns the country

Reports have reached here that the
soldiers in Teking are showing indica

that an uprising will take place

Robert W, Breckons is certain of
being the next Republican national
committeeman for Hawaii, as a result
of yesterday'B territorial convention
and the political arrangements which
preceded and accompanied it.
The committeeman will be named
by the national convention, but in re
ality the choice rests with Hawaii's
delegate to Congress, Prince Kuhio,
and his comrade on the Hawaii dele
gation to Chicago, Henry J. Lyman,
and it may be conjectured that part
of the convention deal which elected
Lyman was that he would Indorse
Breckons for national committeeman.
Kuhio, It is knowff, stood for Breckons
all the way through.
The convention left a few sore
spots, particularly among the support
ers of Charles A. Rice, and the big
meeting hadn't progressed but a short
time until it was evident that the
Andrews wing would be outnumber
ed and beaten. However, there were
less sore spots than had been feared.
The arrangements made on Saturday
and Sunday slid smoothly through,
the only matter riot on the program
being the election .of W. C. AchI as
one of the alternates. He was favor
ed from the start, but his election
wasn't nearly so sure as some other
things among these being the' elec
tion of Kuhio as the "first-string" del
egate and the choice of a delegation
which would support Breckons for
national committeeman.

Lorrin Andrews, appointed by Judge
Stuart as guardian ad litem and "next
friend" of Queen Lilinokalanl, moved
in argument held this morning, to
strike out the demurrer and all mo
tions which Judge Antonio Perry had
filed as attorney for the queen. An
drew stated that it was his belief
that, inasmuch as he himself! had
been appointed as guardian to the
queen, no outside attorney could come
in and offer such papers to the court.
Judge Perry objected to the mo
tion on the grounds that it was am
biguous. He said that he did not
know whether bis authority as an at
torney actually appointed by the
queen was attackeG, or whether It was
attacked on the grounds that the
queen, having appointed him, was in
competent to do so.
In either case Judge Perry declared
that he would be glad to bring evi
dence to bear on the question. He
asked for a specific statement of the
motion and its reduction to writing.
In Judge Whitney's court this morn
ing at 8::J0 o'clock Miss Lucy Ward
was called upon the stand again to
testify as to the sanity of the queen.
the specific time in question being
two years ago at the floral parade
when Miss Ward bad ridden the
queen's own horse, and had decorated
it with different trappings, so that the
queen had not known the horse later.
Miss Ward stated on the stand that
she had mentioned to H. G. Winkley,
bookkeeper for the law firm of Castle
& Withington. that she believed the
queen wag failing in health, but de
nied that she has said the queen's
mind was failing.
Judge Stuart took Attorney Andrews'
motion under advisement, and was to
announce his decision this afternoon
