Torreon, Mex., April 4. Gen
eral Canuto Reyes, commanding
the Villa forces in this locality,
has sent a letter to General Tre
vino, Carranza commander, of
fering to surrender with all his
forces if given amnesty. This
information was given out today
by General Trevino.
Carranza authorities here say that
the surrender ox Keyes would break
organized resistance to the de facto
government and end the hopes of
Villa. There is a disposition, how
ever, to accept this offer conservative
ly, as the letter says six weeks will be
necessary for Reyes to notify all his
followers, and there is a possibility
that this muv be a ruse to gain time
for Villa.
It has been frequently reported late
ly that Villa was making his way to
the north t Torreon in order to effect
a Juncture with Reyes.
Washington. April 4 General Fun

If trouble arose on any Jobs In To

day by union laborers that their co

day. It was hoped that boss contrac

arrangements so union and nonunion
men would not he working together
ami apparently this had been done.
"The announcement made yester
day by all men on jobs was precau
tionary and tended to impress on the
minds of all that union labor will not
mix with nonunion labor on jobs in
Topeka.' said Frank B. Brown today.
"While it was possible that strikes
and walkouts might ensue if nonunion
men were caught on jobs and refused
to take otit cards, it was hoped this
would not be the case. However, even
now trouble might be brewing as the
demand are only a day old anil we
might hear at any time of a walkout

STUBBS ASKS PROBE
Former Kansas Governor Wants Fair
Treatment for Stockmen.
Washington. April 4. Former Gov
ernor Stubbs of Kansas appealed for
a thorough federal investigation of the
beef packing industry today before the
house judiciary sub-committee con
sidering resolution for that purpose.
M . Stubbs represents some western
live stock producers. He said pro
ducers felt packers were dealing un
fairly with them and that both sides
were emitted fo Ha-ve light turned
upon the innermost working of the
live stock industry.
"Tl. producers have many cases for
complaint against packers." he said.
"They cannot understand why hen
hides and other by-products are higher
than ever before when the demand at
home and abroad for meat is greatly
increased that the price of live stock
can be as low as it was in 1915.
"If you men knew of the empty
feed lots where thousands of cattle
used to stand, of the ruined fortune-
of the last few years, of the pro
ducers who have lost all and of th3
unusual profits the packers are mak
ing you would think there was need -of
an investigation."
Questioned by representatives of
the packers. Mr. Stubbs said he had
made a good profit on cattle he bought
last year. He explained, howeve.-.
that if he had raised cattle from calves
he might not have profited. He sug
jested an appropriation of $250. 0C0 be
made available for such an inquiry.

ALLIES DEFEND
RIGHT TO SEIZE
AMERICAN MAIL
: Demands of II. S. Rejected in
Reply to Xote of Protest, j
j Only Letters and Dispatches
Exempt From Confiscation.
PARCEL POST IS NOT MAIL?
An Merchandise Will Be Taken
ver a Formerly.
Accuse Teutons of Showing No
Consideration to Mails.
Washington. April 4. The reply of
the allied governments to the protest
of the United States on seizures of
mails has been received by the state
department.
The allies defend their right to ar
rest and seize merchandise sent as
parcel post and to seize goods falsely
sent as first class mail. However, they
will refrain from seizing and confis
cating letters or dispatches.
The reply is considered a flat rejec
tion of the demands made in the
American note of. protest of January 4,
1916. In this note the United States
made a "formal and vigorous protest
of these unwarranted interferences
with inviolable mails."
Summing up their conclusions, the
memorandum of the allied govern
ments says:
Summary of Keply.
"First, that concerning their
right to visit and eventually to
arrest and seize the merchandise
shipped under the shape of parcel
post must and shall not be treated
differently from the merchandise
shipped any other way.
"Second, that the inviolability
of postal correspondence stipulat
ed by convention number 11 of the
Hague treaty, 1907, carries by no
means any prejudice to the right
of the allied governments to visit
and if need be, to stop and seize
the goods which are falsely de
posited in the covers, envrtspeo e'
letters contained in the mail
sacks.
"Third, that faithful to their
engagements and respectful of
true "correspondence. ' the allied
governments will continue for th
present to refrain from seizing
and confiscating at sea these cor
respondences, letters or dispatches
and that they will insure the rapid
transition ot them as soon as the
genuineness of their character is
known."'
Play New Issue.
Greatest stress is laid in the allies'
reply on their right to seize parcel
post shipments. On the other hand,
the United States in its protest touch

DUTCH WAR MOVE

This Latest of Several Indica
tions She Means War.
Home, April 4 Via London. Wire
1 less reports from Zurich state that
Holland has closed her German fron
i tier and massed all her available
! forces there.
Washington Hears About It.
Washington. April 4. Secretary
i Lansing announced today that the
i state department has oi firial know
ledge that Holland is mobilizing troops
j in addition to those which have been
kept in a state of preparedness since
the war started.
It was not disclosed from where this
information came.
Officials of the state department do
not regard the meeting ot" the parlia
ment of the Netherlands as Important.
They said it was not a special meeting.
Officials were more concerned over
their information concerning the mo
bilization orders.
Ship Sinking Started It.
The unofficial opinion is that the
excitement in Holland is traceable di
rectly to the sinking of the Palembang
and the Tubantia. It is known that
Holland sent out divers immediately
: to determine whether the Tubantia
; was destroyed by a m'n. or a torpedo.
' Sufficient time has eiaj sed for a re-
. port to be made.
A high foreign diplomat said today
that neither Germany nor Holland
would go to war over the Tubantia
land Palembang cases.
"Germany would not to war over
the Tubantia and thf Palembang," le
I said. "And I have not the -slightest
doubt that if Germanv were to advise
Holland, as I think fhe will, that if her
submarine commanders sank the Pal
embang and Tubantia they acted con
trary to orders, Holland will accept
that statement at its face value."

Submarines ot Responsible
for Tonnage Shortage.
London. April 4. Admiral Sir Cyp
rian Bridge, in a report on merchant
shipping losses gives the following
statement of total losses of shipping
from the beginning of the war to
March 23 of this year.
Losses to belligerents:
Steamers, 471 : sailing vessels,
57; trawlers, 245.
Losses to neutrals;
Steamers, 148; sailing vessels;
42; trawlers. 8.
Total. 971.
French Lose 7 Per tent.
The loss to British steam shipping,
says the report, is less than four per
cent of the total number of vessels un
der the British flag and slightly over
6 per cent of the total tonnage. The
French loss in steamers is about 7 per
cent of the total French tonnage,
while the Russian loss is ." per cent
and thp Italian 4 per cent.
"It, therefore, is clear." says the re
port, "that the present shortage of ton
nage is due not to the action of sub
marines but to the great rerjuirement
of the military and naval forces.
Inasmuch as Admiral Bridge has in
cluded the losses of Portugal in the
list of neutrals it is probable that

WOULD COST THREE MILLIONS
Sixteen Feet Wide an:! Built
I
Like Pavement.
Cost Is 62 Per Tent ot Cost of
Repairing1 Dirt Roads.
Plans for a 303 mile concrete high
way from Kansas City through To
peka to Caldwell was uigd before
Governor Capper today by WallPr W.
Jones, a Santa Fe civil engineer. A
1'6 feet concrete highway over the en
tire route could be built for $3,366.
000, Jones declared. The amount is
62 per cent of the cost of repairing
Kansas dirt roads in 1915.
It is probable the Jones plan will
be submitted to the road boosters be
fore the state legislature next winter.
The plan will be considered with other
ideas on permanent highway build
ing. Jones' plan is one of the most
concise and comprehensive that has
been submitted to state officials. His
proposed road would accommodate
4 50.000 Kansans or nearly a third
of the residents of the entire state.
I'nder the plan as outlined by Jones
in a letter to the governor, the road
would be built from the Missouri line
in Kansas City, Kansas to the Okla
homa line near. Caldwell. Sumner
county. The distance is 303 miles.
The proposed highway would extend
from Kansas City to Topeka then to
Emporia. Newton, Wichita. Welling
ton and Caldwell.
Population of SSMM.
Towns through which the Jones road
would pass, have a total population
of 250,000, while the counties benefit
ed by the highway have a population
of 450.000. The road for the entire
distance would have a width of 16
feet.' By reducing the width of the
raod to 14 feet. Jones states that the
expense could be reduced $420,000.
Jones added force, to his argument
today when he urged that the ex
pense for the building of the entire
permanent highway would, b but 62
per cent of the expense for the repair
of Kansas dirt roads rn 1915. That
expanse, Jones has figured, amounted
to $5,436,000. A permanent highway
through the state and directly bene
fitting a third of the population could
be built for a little more than one
half of the annual repair expense.
Next Legislature.
"The question of permanent high
ways will undoubtedly receive some
decisive action at the hands
of the next legislature." Gover
nor Capper predicted today. "One of
the first questions will probably be the
submission of a constitutional amend
ment to enable the state to engage in
road building. The matter of federal
aid must also receive attention, espec
ially if a bill is passed by etmgress pro
viding for aid to states."
Governor Capper declared the Jones
plan offered some valuable suggestions
and will probably be considered by the
highways committees in the next leg
islative session.
