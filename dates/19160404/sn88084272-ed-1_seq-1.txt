Points Out Notification Of

T.ORREON. SI ex., April 4. Canuto
Reyes, commanding the Villa
forces in this locality, has sent
a letter to Gen. Jacinto Trevlno, Car-
ranza commander, offering to sur
render with all his forces if given
amnest. This information was given
out today by Gen. Trevino.
Carranza authorities here nay that
the surrender of Reyes would break
organized resistance to the de facto
government and end the hopes of Villa.
There ie a disposition, however, to ac
cept his offer conservatively, as the
letter says six weeks will be necessary
for Gen. Reyes to notify all his follow
ers, and there Is a possibility that
this may bo a ruse to gain time for
Villa.
Villa May Join Reyes.
It has been frequently reported late
ly that Villa was making his way to
the neighborhood of Torreon In oader
to offect a Junction with Reyes.
In the letter' UB Gelt. Trevino, the
signature of which, has been positive
ly Identified. Reyes says' he deplores
the useless continuation of a bloody
ana nepeiess struggle.
Trevino Gives Illm 10 Days.
In answer. Gen. Trevino said today
that he was preparing proclamations
which would be distributed broadcast,
allowing all bandits ten days to come
in and give up their horses and saddles.
He says that be is confident that be
cause of their knowledge of h.s Just
treatment to those who surrendered in
the Chihuahua campaign, the Mllistab
will respond readily.
Reyes Is the recognized chief of all
the small bands operating In the La
guna and Durango districts, including
those of Contreras and Hilario Rodri
guez. There have been no signs lately of
aggression by Contreras in the Kazas
district. This probably Is due to the
fact that strong Carranza forces now
are located at Velardena. '

FIRST accurate information of the battle in Mexico on last Wednesday, in which Col. Dodd's American cav

ating the Carranza garrison at Guerrero as represented in some quarters on the border. Mr. dementi's dispatch comes
from Gen. Pershing's advance base by motor truck to Columbus, New Mexico, and from Columbus to EI Paso by
wire, and is the first direct from the front news of the first engagement of American troops on Mexican soil. Carranza
claims in El Paso, printed. in The Herald yesterday, in which it was stated that the Guerrero garrison was not an
nihilated by Villa, are borne out by Mr. Clements's vivid story from the front. Mr. Clements's message is printed

Chihuahua Capital; Need
Of Railroad Pressing.
SAN ANTONIO. TEX, April 4-Wiih
the dispatch of the remaJrilns de
tachments of the fifth cavalry
Gen. Funston has sent Into Mexico all
the American troops Immediately avail
able. The actual number of trooi.-
operating In Mexico never has bep
maae pumic for military reasons. 1.
army officers regard the number as a.
together inadequate.
The only troops remaining on the boi -der
are those urgently needed for pa
trol of the international boundary.
Staff officers explained today that
since th beginning of the Villa chase
the situation has been so altered that it
has become imperative that a short cnt
to the field of operations be made or
that the roundabout road now followed
be guarded by a much heavier force.
From Consular and Other Advice.
Assuming, as Gen. Funston now be
lieves, that Villa has gone south of Chi
huahua city and is somewhere neai
Satevo, heading toward Parral, th.
American line of communications will
have to extend indefinitely southward
If the railroads or, particularly, the
Juarez-Chihuahua line of the National
railways is used, a more direct and more
satisfactory line could be established.
Gen. Funston had today received no
word from Gen. Pershing, nor did he
have any advices as to the number of
bandits taken prisoner since the Ameri
can troops entered Mexico.
Need Railroads for Troops.
'If It Is proved beyond doubt that
villa Is on his way south, perhaps
toward Parral, and even Torreon, the
campaign against him cannot be car
ried much farther unless the rallroadi
between Chihuahua and the border are
made available for the movement of
troops or enough more troops are sen!
into Mexico to strengthen greatly the
lines of communication. This was
frankly stated at Gen. Funston's head
quarters, where it was also intimated
that representations to this effect
would be made to the war department.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 4.
Private advices seeming to
show that Villa has been defi
nitely located south of Chihuahua were
received today by the state department
and at once turned over to the war de
partment for transmission to Gen
Pershing.
Gen. Funston advised the war depart
ment today he was sending more troops
into Mexico from Columbus to protect
the line or communication. He did not
state whether any additional troops had
been sent forward to the military base.
Fighting Column Adequate.
So far. Gen. Funston has not sugsest
ted reinforcements of Gen. Pershing's
forces, except merely to protect the ex
tended communication lines and there
was no confirmation today of border
reports that extensive additions to the
fighting column would bo required
Later reports to the war department
say parts of the fifth and 11th cavalrv
and of the 20th and 51th lnafntry were
stationed at Columbus.
Apache Scouts Start South.
Nineteen Apache scouts and trailers
have been ordered from Fort Apathe
Ar-, to Gen. Pershing's column. Capt
Oliver P M. Hazzard of the 10th ca
airy, who was with Gen. Funston whe
he captured Aguinaldo, left with the
scouts for the border today, but he will
not accompany them into Mexico.
The army censorship today veiled the
number and personnel of the additional
troops which have been sent across the
border. MaJ. Gen. Scott, chief of Starr,
said the extra troops had left Columbus
two days ago, but no word of the move
ment had been allowed to leak ouL It
was believed that the fifth cavalry, re
cently sent from Fort Myer, Va, Fort
