Washington. April 4. Wheat of the
1915 crop unfit for milling Is estimat
ed at 146,000,000 bushels as a result of
inquiry made by the department of
agriculture from flour mills and grain
elevators. The replies were so varia
ble as to make accurate deductions im-

without considerable qualification. On
these replies the average worked out
14.4 per cent as the wheat unfit for
j milling and 7.3 per cent or 74,000,000
bushels as feed for live stock.
"Much wheat was used this season
for milling ordinarily would not be
regarded as fit to mill," says a report
of the bureau of crop estimates. "Mod

such equipment to make millable

There is a slight lull in the bat
tle ragintr around Verdun today.
.orthwest of the fortress the ar
tillery of both sides has been ac
tively employed alone: the Avn-conrt-JIalaneourt
front, where the
salient in the line is gradually being-
straightened out by the south
ward push of the Germans.
A Itritish powder factory in
Kent has blown up. causing; the
death or injury of 2'MI persons.
.Norway, says a Copenhagen dis
patch, has asked Germany to in
vestigate whether German subma
rines haTe been responsible for the
sinking- recently of a large num
ber of .Norwegian vessels.
Tho Germans are engaged In
bombarding the region of the
Bonrrus wood, the miles north
west of Verdun, having straight
ened out their line by occupying
all French positions north of the
Fosges brook between llauconrt
and Bethinconrt, northwest of
Verdun.
The French have driven back
the Germans to the northern out
skirts of the ( ailiette wood and
have reoreuplcd the western part
of the village of Yanx. which they
had previously evacuated.
From their new positions south
of the Fosges brook and at Beth,

Torreon, Mex., April 4.
General Canuto Reyes, com

April 4. The strategy whereby
after two weeks of pursuit the
Villa hand under General Fliseo
Hernandez was overtaken by
American troops and dispersed,
w as revealed here today. The plan
was to send the American column
in a straight line, along "the
string of the bow" while Villa was
taking a longer route along the
"arch of the bow." Coupled with
this maneuver was a general or-d,,-r:

Columhns, X. April 4. Gen

obliged to report again today that

whereabouts. This information
came In reply fo demands on the
part of the war department for a
list of American casualties in the
San Geronimo engagements.
The department officials have
been in receipt of numerous com
munications showing the anxiety
of relatives of soldiers in Colonel
George A. Dodd's command. Re
ports of heavy firing along the
American line of communication
caused some fear that the threat

El Paso, Texas, April 4. With Fran

to depart from the military base at

DUTCH PREPARING
FOR CONTINGENCY
Holland's .Minister of War Says Coun
try Will Not Forsake Allies in
Her Neutrality.
Amsterdam, April 4, (via London,
7:30 a. m.) "I do not for a moment
suggest there is a possibility that
Great Britain intends to land her new
armies on the Dutch coast," said for
mer Minister of War Colyn today in
an interview, regarding recent myster
ious military preparations in Holland.
"We have the assurance of Britain
that she will respect our neutrality
and w-e rely on that assurance but the
question is, what does Germany think
of this?
"If the Germans begin seriously to
be afraid of such a contingency, name
ly of the landing of British troops in
Holland, what influence will that have
on Germany's attitude toward us? We
must assume that she is acquainted
with our defensive capacity. If she
judges that capacity inadequate and
considers that a British irruption into
Germany through Holland is to be
feared, would it then be strange if we
were approached from the German
side with proposals to which we can
not suhmit, because they would mean
the abandonment of our neutrality to
ward the allies."
Jonkerr Colyn added that there was
an increasing possibility of conflict
of both sides and while a waiting at
titude might be adopted toward Great
Britain, something positive must be
done with regard to Germany. He sug
gested the strengthening of the Dutch
forces, in order to make clear that
Holland has the power and the inten
tion to prevent a menace to Germany's
open flank.

LYNCH NEGRO FOR
ASSAULT ON GIRL
Kx-Convict Attacks 13-Tear-Old Girl
in Woods Jlob Hangs Him and
Kiddles Body With Bullets.
Idabel, Okla., April 4. "Judge
Lynch" tried, convicted, sentenced, and
executed Oscar Martin, a negro, In this
city yesterday. Martin was arrested
near Bismarck, charged with having
criminally attacked a "lS-year-bld white
girl, who with a girl companion was
gathering wild onions in the woods
when the negro appeared. After talk
ing to the children the negro threw
Edna Murphy to the ground and be
gan choking and otherwise mistreating
her.
Her companion screamed and ran to
where some negroes were fishing near
by, but they paid no heed to her en
treaties and she went back and met
Edna in a state of hysteria, her clothes
disheveled and torn.
They reported the attack and that
night the negro was captured, identi
fied by the girls, and brought to Idabel
and placed in jail.
Yesterday morning the preliminary
hearing was held in the district court
room and the examination was listened
to by a crowd. The evidence was in
and the court was ready to pronounce
his finding when the mob moved on
the officers who had the negro in
charge, disarmed them, and took
charge of the negro.
A rope was soon in evidence and the
negro was hustled through the rear
door of the court house. The rope was
placed around his neck, tied to the
railing of the gallery, and Martin was
shoved over the rail, falling about 12
feet
In his struggles Martin caught hold
of some upright timbers that supported
the gallery, but he was pulled away
from the support and a couple of bul
lets put an end to him.
Except for a few cheers and the pis
tol shots the lynching was done quietly,
yet the mob would brook no interfer
ence from the officers.
The evidence in the case was posi
tive and there Is no danger of having
hanged the wrong man. Martin had
only recently finished a term in the
Arkansas penitentiary, where he was
sent for attempting a similar offense
and where he would have been lynched
had the officers not spirited him away,

Probe Now Started.
Washington, April 4. Charges that
collusion has existed for years be
tween certain deputy internal revenue
collectors in New York City and cigar
manufacturers, recently arrested in
the alleged $20,000,000 tobacco fraud
cases, are under investigation by the
treasury department.
Treasury officials said today that
Carl E. Whitney, a New York lawyer,
had filed charges that a number of dep
uty internal revenue collectors in that
city are involved in the recently dis
covered tobacco frauds, involving hun
dreds of cigar and cigarette manufac
turers in which the government is be-.
lleved to have lost $20,000,000 in un
collectable internal revenue. Mr.
Whitney made his charges to assist
ant Secretary Malbourn. He is coun
sel for some of the cigar manufactur
ers. An investigation is being made by
John Z. Lowe, collector of New York..
Manufacturers Paid Officers.
According to treasury officials Mr.
Whitney charged that collectors have
been not only receiving remittances
from manufacturers but in some cases
have approached manufacturers who
were not evading the law and pointed
out the ease with which they could
escape payment of revenue duties and
offered to cooperate with them to this
end for small considerations weekly.
PEOPLE STIRRED BY
SECTARIAN SPEAKER
Haverhill, Mass., April 4. A trail of
broken glass was the only visible evi
dence today of the disturbance of last
night when a mob held the city in its
power for several hours and smashed
windows at will. Several persons were
injured by flying missiles but no one
was seriously hurt.
The cause of the riot was the objec
tion of many residents to the granting
by the city government of a permit to
Thomas A. Leyden of Somerville to de
liver an address in the city hall on
sectarian questions, particularly re
garding state appropriations for secta
rian schools.
An immense crowd formed about
the building and became so threaten
ing that the meeting was abandoned.
The crowd then began throwing stones
at windows in the city hall. Portions
of the mob went to other parts of the
city and attacked the residences of
persons who had assisted in arranging
for Leyden's address.
The local militia company was called
out and cleared the streets.

Donley's friends believe he was driv

the complaint against him and, open
