t.Y .MOCI.TID ......
EL PASO. April 4.?There is little
question any longer on the border
mi vma li iieamng tor Torreon in
the neighborhood of which city he
will find Canuto Reyes, one of his
most trusted lieutenants.
Reyes has successfully defated the
Carranza forces for several months.
Re has ravaged north Durango and
Is believed to have several hundred
men In his command with many
smaller guerilla bodies operating In
conjunction with bim. If Villa can
effect a junction with Reyes sufficiently
In advance of his pursuers to
attempt a concentration or the bandits.
it Is said that he can muster
2,000 men at least.
Both Mexicans and Americans who
know Villa personally have little
doubt as to the tactics he Is trying
to pursue. They say that the fugitive
bandit Is not alarmed over any
opposition he may meet from his
countrymen, but that he Is devoting
all hia anaralftR to nlannlnir th? rii?u
comflture of the American forces
whom he fears almost as much as
he hates.
According to these observers. Villa
Is anxious to push as far south as
possible with the purpose of stretching
out the already thin line of communication
of the Americans to the
breaking point With the comparatively
few men under the command of
General Pershing, a line of communi
cation 100 or 500 mtleB long becomes
a serious problem.
Torreon Is 500 miles.fr.ani.Columbus
as the crow flies, but a far greater
distance by the winding trails that
are the only trails acrosB northern
Chihuahua.
With Francisco Villa still In flight
and his whereabouts apparently unknown
to his pursuers, the campaign
of the American forces now scouring
northern Chihuahua for the bandit,
entered Tuesday upon a broader
plane. New troops have been ordered
Into Mexico from the military
base at Columbus, N. M? to protect
the lengthening lines of communicatlbn.
Villa has been reported at many
points In the broad zone which ranges
frnm <ha Rovnn eniintm> 4n 4V>a T>??t
to-Juarez district. The laBt Mexican
report vai that he was south ot Salevo
and heading for Parrel, but this
could not be confirmed. The difficulties
of the pursuit have multiplied
because of the misleading Information
given by Mexican peons to General
Pershing's men.
Army men here believe that as1
Villa nioveB southward with his trail
well covered for the time at least It
will be necessary to establish new
army bases and strongly guard the
line of communication.
Large re-enforcements of American
troops will be needed, the military
authorities say.
Meanwhile the use by the Amerl
can. army of the Mexican Northwestern
railway for the transportation of
supplies becomes more Important.
PASSES IN MOUNTAINS
AR'E ALL GUARDED NOW
far AarociATtD eactai
COLUMBUS, N. M? April 4.?Latest
reports from the front Indicates
that every pass In the mountains, every
canyon and every means of escape
over the rocky slopes was being
guarded by the cavalrymen, assisted
by a detachment of mountain Infantry
especially fitted for the work as a
Minlt nf flhonrtroHrtno nf
of the Alpine troops of the European
belligerents. It was said that the
pursuit Is progressing under more favorable
weather conditions, the high
winds, which for some days swirled
snow, and rain in the faces of the
troopers, having abated and been replaced
by a warm April sun. ,
Whether Villa can for any length
of time make good his escape under
' the conditions In a matter of much
- speculation, hut army men here are
Inclined to believe that at least he
has an even chance to evade his lm'
mediate pursuers.
