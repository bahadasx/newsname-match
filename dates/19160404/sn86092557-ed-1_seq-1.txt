Chilton Tells Why
He Favors Brandeis
Awnelatcil Press)
WASHINGTON, April 4.?Senator
Chilton'** reasons for recommending
the confirmation of Louis D. Brandeis
as supreme court justice were given
today to the Judiciary committee. Mr.
Chilton was chairman of the sub-com
mittee which heard charges against
Brandeir. and one of tho three Demo*
crats who reported in his favor.
"Such a man as Mr. Brandeis," said
Senator Chilton, "so prominently ac
tive in public and private life and at
a period of construction of the Sherman
law the awakening of states to their
duty concerning industrial combina
tions and the determination of the di
viding line between State and Na
tional power, is bound to have been
engaged in contests before the court
and before legislative bodies more or
less bitter. And he would indeed be a
human prodigy if he had not aroused
some bitter antagonism. It is in evi
dence that there was a systematic
campaign of advertisement to injure
him in estimation of the public."

(By Associated Press)
EL PASO. April 4.?There is little
question any longer on the border
that Villa is heading for Torreon. in
the neighborhood of which city he will
find Canuto Reyes, one of his most
trusted lieutenants. Royes has sun
cessftilly defeated the Carranza forces
for several months. He has ravaged
north Durango and is believed to have
several hundred men In his command
with many smaller guerilla bodies
operating in conjunction with hi?. If
Villa can effect a junction with Riay?s
sufficiently in advance or hij pursuers,
to attempt a concentration of the ban
dits, It is said that he can muster
2.000 men at leaat.
Both Mexicans and Americans who
know Villa personally have little
doubt aB to the tactics he is trying to
pursue. They say the fugitive bandit
Is not alarmed over any opposition he
may meet from his-countrymen, but
that ho is devoting all his energies
planning the discomfiture of the- Am
erican forces whom he fears almost
as much as be hates.
AccordSng to these observers, villa
is anxious to push as far south as
possible with the purpose of stretch
ing out the already thin line of com
munication of the Americans to the
breakinfi point. With comparatively
Tew men under the command of Gen
eral Pershing's line of communication.
400 or BOO miles long becomes a seri
ous problem.
Torreon Is BOO miles from Colum
bus as the crow flies, but a far great
er dlstanco by the winding trails that
aro the only roads across northern
Chihuahua.

en even chance to evade his imme
dJato pursuers.
