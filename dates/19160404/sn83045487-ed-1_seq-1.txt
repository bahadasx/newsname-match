DOORS DRAW A SUIT
Woman Crushed In Big Door Jam Sues For $25,000
All State Street Hit by Move For Safer Doors
Council May Be Asked to Act.
The revolving door, used by State
street department stores to handle
the crowds that crush their way in
to buy, was pictured as a dangerous
contraption today by former Ass't
Corporation Counsel Geo. L. Reker.
And to prove his contention, Reker
slapped a $25,000 personal injury
suit on Rothschild's at Van Buren
and State streets.
The suit is & result of the injuries
sustained by Mrs. Mary Etten, 60
years old, ol 3918 JEfrafBe ay.,. who
chanced to be a shopper in Roths
child's, during the holiday season.
One afternoon very near Christmas
when the crowds were at their worst,
Mrs. Etten passed through Siegel
Cooper's and over into Rothschild's.
In doing so, she braved the dangers
of two swirling, revolving doors
safely.
She made a purchase in Roths
child's and then tried to get from the
store by means of another revolving
door on State street near Jackson
blvd.
