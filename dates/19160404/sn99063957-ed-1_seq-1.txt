1 Evacuate This Stronghold Plan To Take Bethincourt
and Smother Lines to the West Crown Prince Sacrifices
Thousands In Vain Attempt at Verdun
London, April 4. Massed German batteries on three
sides of Bethincourt are giving French positions a ter
rific bombardment today, and it is feared the defenders
will soon be forced to evacuate their strongholds. .
French successes at Vaux village and the surrounding
country were not sufficient to offset the German gain on
a two mile front northwest of Verdun. French positions
west of the Meuse are believed to be seriously endangered.
A heavy artillery battle continued during the whole
of yesterday on the entire sector northwest of Verdun.
For a week the Germans have been shelling Hill H04. It
is the keystone of the outer defenses in that district. Teu
ton shells have crumbled its trenches and wrecked the
French batteries stationed there.
Indications are that the Germans plan to take Bethin
court and smother French lines to the west under an over
whelming attack, forcing the French to retire to the shel
ter of the first permanent fortifications of Verdun, near
Esnes.
French gains yesterday near Vaux confirmed military
observers in their belief that the crown prince will not be
able to take Verdun from the northeast. He has sacri
ficed thousands of men and made no important progress
on that side since the capture of Douaumont.
Dispatches from the front said large forces of Ger
mans were noted on. the British front in Flanders and
northern France. Since beginning their smash at Ver
dun the Germans have depleted their armies elsewhere
to aid the principal offensive but the large force opposite
the British has not been disturbed lest General Sir
Douglas Haig's men size the opportunity for an allied
drive.
Paris. April 4. Germans heavily
shelled French positions northwest of
Verdun during the night, particularly
Malaneourt and Avocourt, official an
nouncement declared today. There were
no infantry attacks.
West of the Meuse the French batter
ies kept up a continuous fire from
ouaumont to Vaux village. In the Ar
gounc forest nH'o French guns were
busy. Fast of I.e Pretre woods French
infantry dispersed strong Herman re
comoitering parties.
Holland Refuses Demand.
F.erlin, April 4. Holland lias flatly

its Gorman frontier be closed as an

There is no doubt that developments
at the allied military conference in

tivity, according to belief here. Allied

Bethlehem Steel Wants
To Be Real Good Dog
Washington, April 4. Before tho
house, naval committee today, Represen
tatives of the Bethlehem Steel company
made a finnl effort to prevent recom
mendation of the government armor
plate bill being voted.
President Grace promised that, if the
United States sohul.l be involved in
war or threatened with war, his plant
would furnish products at "any price
the government choses to pay." He
further asserted his factories would run
24 hours a day, if necessary, to supply
federal requirements for armor plate.
A promise to manufacture armor plate
indefinitely at any price the trade com
mission might fix was likewise made.
Grace said he made the offers as a
matter of patriotism, ami also with a
view to saving $7,(HIO,IWO which had
been invested. The plant had previous
ly offered armor plate at W.l't a ton
for a ryriod of five years. It is doubt
ful whether these, overtures will pre
vent government competition.

City Council Accepts Gift, But
No Transfer Will Be Made
For Some Time
The gift of the fifty acre trict
known as Hush's Pasture to tiie city
of Knlcm as a city park was accepted
by the city council last night anil it is
freely estimated that Salem will in
time have one of the largest ind most
beautiful city parks of any towu in the
Willamette valley. The gift was made
by A. X. Bush, who wishes the tract of
land to remain intact as a memorial to
the lite Asahel Bush and the offer was
made by Attorney George U. Hingham
in behalf of tile Bush estate. The
actual transfer of the property will not
be made, however, during the lifetime
of Miss Sally Bush but since the city
council voted to accept the gift of the
park, a survey will be made of the
property boundaries and a convey nice
prepared for acceptance and delivery.
A scenic winding boulevard will
skirt the park from Mission street at
a point about the east end of the pies
eut stone wall, which bounds the Hush
premises, and extending southerly and
following the hill. The remainder of
tiie tract lying east of the boulevard is
to he the park proper.
By the specif ications the tract is to
remain in tiie condition it is-at present
during the lifetime of Miss Hush.
No streets, alleys or thoroughfares
are to be laid out across the tract, but
this restriction will not apply to. park
walks and drives. Also the city is to
pledge itself that no franchise for a
steam, electric or street railway will
ever be granted across the premises or
across any street leading to the prem
ises in such inannr as to permit a right
of way to be condemned across the
land, and also that no franchises shall
be granted for railways on streets or
alleys laid out on the unconveyeJ por
tion of the entire tract during the life
time of Miss Bush. This is not intend
ed to prevent a franchise being granted
on Mission street paralleling the street
or paralleling the boundaries of the
tract outside the park, but is to include
the park and boulevard.
As stated iu the offer made, the city
the purpose of the gift is to maintain
the tract of land intact east of the pro
posed boulevard as one compact body,
nnd during the lifetime of Miss Bush
the uiiconveved portion of the Bush
tract.
Any violation of the terms by the
city shall work as ti forfeiture of the
con vcyance.

TO LAND 400,000 GERMAN

Would Make Main Attack at

(By Wilbur S. Forrest, United I'rcss

London, April 4. A P.uropean power,
invading the United Stutes, would
strike simultaneously at the unfortified
shores of Chesapeake bay and at Bos
ton, according to Jlajor C. Dnriiley
Stuart-Stephens in an article in tho
Pictorial.
The major savs that the German staff
already has worked out such a plan.
laougn ins Article mnv appear lar
fetched, it presents an interesting de
scription of what would happen should
Germany, or any other strong Kuro-
pean nation, decide to invade America.
ritty per cent of the German mer
cantile marine is iu Hamburg and Bre
men," said Major Stuart Stephens. " In
1.) days this flotilla could land 1110,000
German veterans on the New England
oast line. Ni efficient is the aenerul
staff organization thnt these liners
would return iu another month with a
like number.
"The Herman striking point would
bo at Boston, wiiicii would, of course,
be eaptured from tfie land side and tho
defenders of which, paltry in them
selves, would bo devoid of even the
presence of such a garrison as. could
maintain more than a couple of days'
resistance.
"A minor operation would be con
ducted simultaneously nt Cnesapeako
bay, where there are even now no for
tifications. Then would follow tho
holding of n line extending from Lake
Krie to Chesapeake bay, both flanks
protected' by water ami behind it tho
sea. Also between the niturul ram
parts occupied by the invader and the
sea coast are practically all the Ameri
can arsenals, nine-tenths of the steel
works, the munitions factories of Con
necticut ami the ship building yards.
"This, then the vital region for tho
equipment iiiii maintenance of the na
tion's defense, would lie in the enemy's
rear. The whole of the republic, save
the ull-impoitant section behind the ene
mies' lines could live comfortably with
plenty of foodL clothes and movies
wherewith to remove the tedium of
time, but the American colossus would
be without shells, without guns and
without the material for their produc
tion. Vears would elapse before
America could, under those conditions,
scientifically equip a sufficient army to

The end of tiie invasion, tho major
saw, would lie that America "woild

El Paso, Texas, April 4. American
troops are approaching tho Durango
state line from south of Chihuahua Citv-
surprising army observers by the rapid
ity of their southward march. On Fri
day Colonel George Dodd's men appear
ed at San Antonio, uear Cusihuiriachic.
Simultaneously Franci-sco Villa travers
ed tho Satevo district, 50 miles south,
and was reported fleeing to his familiar
haunts in Durungn mountains. 7t is he
lioved' he will not attempt to join the
Canuto Reyes In the) Torreon regioa.
Instead, ho will probably hide ia tlx
Durnngo Sierras.
Fifteen thousand Cnrranzista were
reported today marching northward
from Torreon.
Absence of illuininnfng reports from
the rmi'suit resulted in Wakiington
sending Brigadier General J. .1. Persh
ing a request for a statement.
Major Sample an nounced that P"--'
ing would send an aeroplane up t
soino point on the lines of communica
tion in the event of Villa's capture.
It was admitted as possible th
la had escaped the Cordon of Dodd's
and Pershing s troopers.
Pershing is thought to be south rf
Ran Antonio, no close to Villa that he
has no time to reach his lines of com
munication. Aeroplanes are unablo to cope with
the light air of high altitudes. Lieu
tenant Willis had a narrow escape whilei.
flying last Sunday. He wan borinp;
through a mist at great speed when the
fog lifted suddenly rcveal his plann
heading into a wall of rock. He swooped
upward and was out of danger just in
die nick of time.
Juan Terrezns, cattle king, arrived
from Chihuahua City today nnd con
firmed the report that Villa had gonn
toward Satevo with a small following.
His information contained no mention
that the outlaw chief had been wound
ed, however. The belief Is growing here
that Villa has not been injured. Though
General Pershing reported ho had heard
o'f Villa being hurt, tho information
was only an indirect story from wood
cutters who claimed they saw "Pan
cho" with a broken leg, fleeing in a
litter. Pershing has since stated thnt
bucIi clues from Mexicans aro some
times misleading.
