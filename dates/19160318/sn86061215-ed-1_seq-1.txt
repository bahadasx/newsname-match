San Antonio, Tex., March 17. —The

"I am of the opinion that acts of

BORDER KEYED UP.
Hi paso, Tex. March 17.—Expecta
tion along the border was keyed to
its highest piteh today by the general
belief that before nightfall the ad
vance guard of the American expe
ditionary force would have entered
Villa territory In the mountains of
the Casas Grandes region of Mexico.
While the censorship prevented
any official news of the whereabouts
of the American columns, reports
brought by Americans arriving from
the interior coupled with the ealculSA
tlons of men thoroughly familiar with
the territory over which the expedi
tionary force was passing made it
reasonably certain that the United
States soldiers must be close to the
district where Villa Is believed to ex
ercise his greatest influence and to
have the largest numbers of sympa
thizers.
With the possibility that actual
fighting with the Villistas might be
gin at any moment, interest was re
doubled in every item of intelligence
that threw any light on the attitude
of the Carranza adherents and more
especially on that of the five detach
ments of Carranza troops who are
declared by the officials of the de
facto government to be operating
against Villa.
No Mexican Guides.
Andres Garcia, the Carranza con
sul here, who Is recognized as the
closest man to the first chief on the
border, refused to make any definite
statement as to what cooperation the
American officers might expect from
the Mexican authorities. It was sug
gested to him that the Carranza forces
could render valuable aid in supplying
guides, aiding in the obtaining of for
age and in similar directions.
"The Americans have guides of their
own," he said, "who I am sure are as
good as any we could give them. I
feel equally certain that they have
better maps than any we have. The
soldiers of Gen. Carranza are march
ing against Villa, the American sol
diers are doing the same. That seems
to me to be cooperation and it is all
I have to say."
Rumors of Revolt.
Rumors of disaffection and revolt
smong the Carranza troops are plen
tiful here as there are people to
spread them, but all reliable informa

DUST CLOUDS THAT TROOPS
CAU8E MAKE THEIR LOCA
TION TOO EVIDENT.
San Antonio, Tex., March 17.—Night
marches probably will be made by
Gen. John J. Pershing's expeditionary
forces in their search for Francisco
Villa, it was indicated today at Ft.
Sam Houston. Night marches would
help to mystify Villa as to the move
ments of the American columns and
would be easy of accomplishment, it
is said, because there \ls sufficient
light for the purpose. Also they would
keep the men and horses fresher.
Days could be used for reconnoltering.
Daylight marches make it impossi
to hide troop movements. Huge clouds
of dust indicate the marchers' pro
gress and are visible at great dis
tances.
There will be no music for the sol'
diers to enjoy, while on the maroh or
in camp, it has become known. Not a
single regimental band has been taken
with the expedition, as it was desired
not to handicap the expedition with
&ny useless appendage.
Word was received today that C. A.
Williams, American consul, who Quit
Torreon when trouble with Villa broke
out, is on his way here from Laredo,
where he arrived yesterday.
CARRANZA GIVES AID.
Douglas, Ariz., March 17. —Carransa
troops of Gen. P. Ellas Calles, military
governor of Sonora, were making
every effort today to cooperate with
the soldiers composing the punitive ex
pedition from the United States In the
pursuit of Francisco Villa, according
to reports received her*.
Persons arriving here during the
night from the Bavlspe valley in
eastern Sonora stated that 400 Calles
troops were strongly entrenching
themselves near Baylspe to repel any
sortie Villa may make against Bavispe,
San Miguel, La Galera and nrTigre.
Several hundred Mexican troops,
commanded.by Llejit. Col. Dato Camp
bell, are reported to .have passed
through Pulplto pass into Chihuahua
and were expected to give active sup

this was to "keep the men/occupied

The Mexican situation was discus

Secretary Wilson at today's cabinet

positively established whether the
sinking was due to a mine or a tor

the part of those who were on board
in attributing it to a submarine's act.
The crew base their belief in this re
gard chiefly on the intense violence of
the explosion and on the fact that it
occurred amidships.
The vessel was outward bound from
Amsterdam to South American ports,
carrying a crew of 294 and eighty-two
passengers, the latter mostly neutrals,

the ship was a great popular favorite
owing to its size knd luxurious ap
pointments. The press comments re
flect anger and indignation. The
Nleuwe Rotterdamesche Courant says:
"Between being torpedoed and being
mined the only difference which exists
is that known in criminal law between
intention and conditional intention. If
the ship was torpedoed then there was
absolute Intention, or ignorance or
neglect equivalent to intention. The
submarine commander must have
known when he gave the command to
fire that the ship was the Tubantia.
No words can be found to qualify this
crime no excuses can be accepted."
The Dutch admiralty states that 377
survivors from the Tubantia have
arrived in Holland while the revised
lists of the steamship company show
that there were 381 persons aboard,
according to a Reuter dispatch from
The Hague.

Schilling and family were saved. They

No Panie Aboard.
It Is now believed there was a small
number, of lives lost In the sinking of
the Tubantia, either in the explosion
or in an accident which attended the
launching of a life boat. The steam
ship remained afloat several hours.
According to all reports there was
no panic, everyone, on board behaving
splendidly. The boats were launched
in their appointed order and the pas
sengers were all taken off first. The
rescue work was difficult owing to the
darkness, the heavy mist and the

the fact that he has opposed the com

conclusion is consequently drawn that
a change may be looked for in the
