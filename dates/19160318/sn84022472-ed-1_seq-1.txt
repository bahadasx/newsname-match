Inadequate Equipment And
Shortage of Help Are
-Chief Causes. .
Investigation made by the Trans
portation Committee of the Chamber,
of Commerce, K. W. MiniM, E- H. Ha
vens, C. A. - Baldwin and George G.
, Goulden, whose . special request, added
to others, caused the Interstate Com
merce Commission to act in the mat
ter of freight embargoes on railroads
is said to have been most illuminat
ing as to the cause"" of tying up New
VbVki and New England in one of the
worst , freight congestions ever known
in America.
Intimations reaching this city today
are to the effect that the Commission's
committee of railroad heads are con-
certing their efforts towards relieving
the situation , found at - the Harlem
river terminus of the New Haven,,
where it is said that the Erie, Centra
of New Jersey and the' Delaware,
Lackawanna & Western railroads at
times have been delivering an average
of l,500jTears daily, with less than 100
being- moved in the same period by the
New Haven road.' - - '
Investigation has shown the New
Haven roaa to be inadequately
equipped with motive power, and that
offers of the three roads mentioned to
transport engines across the Manhat
tan Lower bay .with the freight trains
and run' them through . under the
loaned motive power has had to "be
refused because of lack Of ingineers
qualified to operate trains on certara.-
sections." , ', " -- ' 'I , ; ' "'.
Information from New -York and the
West indicates that- because of the
great growth of transportation bus
iness to New ; England .irundreds of
thousands - of cars have been tied- up
in New Tork city and vicinity' due to
the New Haven's lack of facilities and
experienced men; to' operate ' trains,
,with the consequent result that in the
far west there is a serious shortage of
- "empties' with which to move even
the foodstuffs that are necessary fof
Consumption in the East. This fact is
iorne out by-inquiry among-'manufac-
'turers in this city - which 33bo"?Vs "that'
the majority have Increased fcheir in-.-coming
and outging. shipments over' 50
jer cent., while some factories claim
that their shipping volume has in
creased above 100 per cent. This con
dition is true of New Haven and Wa
terbury shippers. " , .
A report i received from W-aterbury
today' which, confirms the information,
received tn this city indicates that
thousands 6t cars are-lying idle' in
freight yards, being neither loaded 'or'
- unloaded .because of f lack of 1 motive
power to move them tip locations prox
imate to consignees. t .. ,' ' , , -
jSuch a condition obtains' to -a lesser
degree in this city. At - the lower
yards,, the East End yards and the
Water street terminal there .was little
activity today. In response to In
quiries made by the Chamber of Com
merce and shiper dt was said by the
railroad company that . .many con
signees were paying the Jl a day de
murrage rather than to 'empty cars.
On the other hand shippers declared,
that the cars were being placed at dis
tances too great to permij; transfer of
cargoes by truck except at high ex
pense.: '

Though the situation presented toy
- the discovery of the omission might
lead to trouble in the event that there

"FRAMED," PLEAD
YOUNG H IN
ROBBERY CASE
Tell Judge Bartlett of Al
leged Plot Against Them
By a Detective
Two young men who are believed by
the police to be the persons who have
been -y. terrorizing residents in the
neighborhood of the Remington' Arms
& Ammunition Co., have been bound
over to the superior courtunder bonds
of $1,000 each. They are Thomas Bar
ry, aged 20, and John J. Kelly, aged 19,
of New York. Barry is a former in
mate of the House of Refuge and
Kelly is believed wanted by police in
other cities.
In the city court this morning police
expressed the belief that the youths
are highwaymen. 'They were charged
with highway robbery. -
The youths were arrested by Ser
geant iThomas Flood and Policeman
Jaeob Grossman on the night of March
11, at East Main street and Boston
avenue. They were acting suspicious
ly in front of Engine Company No.- 10
house in Putnam street. - The police
were pu on their trail after they went
away. " 1
In Barry's pockets were found Pe
volver, several bullets and - a gold
watch with a fob attached -bearing the
'initial "K." In the city court both
were charged , with breach -of the
peace. The owner of the watch ap
peared at police headquarters and in
formed the police that he had been a
victim of two young holdup men. .
In the city court this morning the,
louowmg information was diselosed:
On the night of March 9, about" ten
oclock, Andrew Krucovsky, age 24,
f,496 Pembroke street, was returning
to his home in company with Miss
Christine Balanta, age 23, 1,498 Pem
broke street. They had been to a lec-
r'ture and wer,e (returning home. At
Pembroke street and Boston avenue,
opposite the site formerly occupied by
the Old Mill Green ischoolhouse, they
were held up by two young men. , It
is a forlorn spot and the darkness is
intense at night. Krucovsky said that
a- young man answering the descrip
tion of Barry thrust a revolver in 13
face and ordered "Hands up!"
Barry is alleged to have "pOvered"
Krucovsky with the weapon while
Kelly searched the latter's pockets.
Several trinkets were taken from him
as well as a gold watch with the fob
bearing the initial "K" snd $0.30 in
money. When the searching was com
pleted Barry, the gunman, is alleged
to have said: "Red, make sure and
search the left trousers pocket."
Miss Balanta corroborated the story
of her -escort and .said that while she
could not positively identify Barry she
was positive that one of the young
highwaymen was tall and slender and
that Barry, had cajled him "Red."
Kelly is. titian haired and both young
men answered the descriptions-given
by their alleged victims.
Kelly said in court: "All I have to
say. Judge, is that what that lady said
Is a lie. I never saw her before- in
all my life." .
Barry said: "Well,' Judge, I've got
this to say; that it is a fixed job to
send us away. Up in the jail a de
tective brought this man and wormy
to see us. He told them to report to
him at police headquarters on the
morning of the trial and that he would
tell them wha to say in court. I well
remeber him saying, 'Remember that
one of the iguys is red-headed,' It is
a crooked scheme. Judge, to 'railroad
mi and I say it is all a frame-up."
Juctge Bartlett bound them over.
Bonds were fixed at '$l,000 in each
case. x

powder , reservation, living at 'the bar
racks in Boston, avenue, complained
to the police last night that, he had
been held up and robbed of $6 at the
same spot two weeks ago. The descrip
tion he gave of the holdup men tallies
with, that of Barry and Kelly. This
charge, .will be pressed in the superior
court. Another resident of East
Bridgeport, who refused to give his
name, said he would, come to head

AMERICANS .NOT
TO OCCUPY ANY
TOWNS, IS RULE
- Washington,. March,-' 1 8 American
troops pursuing Villa and his bandits
have, no 'intention and no orders "to
occupy any cities or towns during their
march into Mexico. ' .
This was stated at the White Holse
and war ; department -today after re
ceipt of a report that General" Ga
viera, -the Carranza commander at
Juarez, had given -notice that General
Pershing's ' troops ..would not Be al
lowed to occirpy Casas Grandes or oth
er towns.
It was declared by , administration
officialshat the pursuit 'of Villa, be
ing entirely a punitive expedition, had
none of the characteristics 0 an in
vasion and that there . was no object
in occupying towns, or cities, because
the American troops will " keep con
stantly on the. move. ,
Officials said today that the. situa
tion at Tampico, where uneasiness is
Said to exist among Americans and
other foreigners had , no bearing on
the pursuit of Villa. .
Reports received at both the , war
and state departments oday continued
to be optimistic.
Secretary Baker early today issued
the following statement:
"The reports - received . directly
through military channels and those
sent to this department from ' other
departments of the goverurment indi
cate quiet along.,the entlrej border, ex
cept some excitement at Tampico,
which is apparently temporary and
without cause.- ,
"There are no reports of operations
of the expedition' available for publi
cation."
The secretary said he would leave
Washington this afternoon fjr his
home at Cleveland and would not re
turn here until Tuesday morning. In
his absence Major General Hugh J-.
Scott, chief of staff, will be acting sec
retary . of war.
TROOPS ARE NEARING
VILLA'S TERRITORY
EI Paso, March 18 If the speed of
30 miles a day at which the expedi
tionary column has moved is main
tained, the American soldiers should
be in Villa territory before nightfall,
Casas; Grandes, is 25 miles from the
border of the district of Guerrero, the
bandit chief's 'native heath. There has
been no reliable report as to the exact
whereabouts of Villa but it is consid
ered fairly certain that he has taken
refuge1 in the fastnesses of the Sierra
Madras, one of the wildest and most
inaccessible regions in all Mexico. The
people of Guerrero are said to be fan
atical followers of the fugitive and he
can rely on them for foodc recruits and
information as to the movements of
his pursuers.
' The task of the United States will
rtally not have begun until they reach ,
the foothills. The arrival of the ex
peditionary troops in? the vicinity of
Casas Grandes was greeted -along the;
border with a sigh, of relief, insofar
as the fate of the 500 American Mor- ..
mons at Colonia Dublan and Colonia
Morales is concerned. The soldiers
are already south of these settlements :
and . consequently all fear's for the '
safety of the colonists have been re- ;
moved. .. 1
While the expedition has passed
peacefully thus far into Mexico and :
the Carranza officials have shown -every
indication of both their willing- '
ness and ability to avoid friction, the
tension- along the Rio Grande has by
no means relaxed. It is felt here that
the real test will come when fighting :
with the Villista bandits actually!
starts The lengthening lines of com-
munication, it is pointed out, offer
tempting bait for raids by guerillas..
The refugees in the border towns are
especially Insistent . that the first '
bloodshed will be the signal for ser- ;
ious trouble. ,
CHowever, thus far the border 'is
very peaceful. Capt. W. D. Green, the ;
night chief of police of El Paso, stated j
today that he had never known the ,
city to be so ' quiet anad free from
crime. '
Washington, March 18. Navy offi-,
cials continued to reiterate that move-,
ments of chips and marines had no
concern with the Mexican situation.
Riverside, Cal., March 18. Volun
teers are being enrolled today for a
vigilance committee of 200 authorized
hv the city council for service in the
event of a Mexican outbreak. Rifle
and ammunition will be purchased for

Judge Lenient With
Excise Law Violators
nwimr to the fact that no effort was
made to conceal the intentions of the
promoters to' sell liquor in violation- of
trie, excise law. Judge Frederic A.
Bartlett in the city court this morning
said he would be lenient in the case of
James A. Brennan. 451 East Main
street, charged .with selling liquor
without a licenie, and a fine of $50
was imposed.
In the case of the five bartenders
who had been hired by Brennan and

aret and dance at Sokol hall in Hal
lett street one week ago last night.
Quantities of liquor were on hand for
sale. Brennan had no l.cerlse to sell
and he had no permit to hold the
dance. He was arrested upon order of
John O. Stanley, president of the po
