e White and Colored Republican Politicians or Would Be

District Are Enjoying a Good Old Fashioned Scrap Among
Themselves, Lawyer Augustus L. Williams Feels That He
Is "Nosing" to the Front in His Contest for Delegate to the

TWO COLORED AND ONE WHITE 'ABE STBIVING TO BECOME A
MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN STATE COMMITTEE OF ILLINOIS
AND THEY WILL FIGHT EACH OTHER LIKE DEMONS TO WIN OB
GAIN THAT HONOR.
"HABEAS-CORPUS," WILLIAM G. ANDERSON AND HIS FRIENDS AND
BACKERS CONTEND THAT IN HIS BACE AS AN INDEPENDENT
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR ALDERMAN OF THE SECOND WABD
THAT HE IS RUNNING- THROUGH IT LIKE .A STREAK OF WILD
FIRE; THAT HE WILL MAKE. IT .MIGHTTvjINTEBESTING TOXAL
DERMAN HIGH NOBRISAND HABRT HELDRETH, JR., FROM NOW
UNTIL THE ALDERMANIC POLLS CLOSE TUESDAY EVENING
APRIL 4.
Before the year of 1916, draws to a
close it will produce more statesmen or
would-be statesmen than can be
counted in many a day, this is already
true in the second ward or in the First
Congressional District of Illinois for in
that district the White and Colored
Republican politicians or so-called
statesmen are engaged in going at or
after each other for dear life and if all
signs do not fail many a mix np will
occur between them between now and
Tuesday April 11, for many years it
seems that in that district that a small
faction of the Colored voters residing
in it have always bitterly fought
against permitting the White politic
ians or statesmen to represent them on
all political occasions and this year ab
a further protest in that direction,
Lawyer Augustus L. Williams finally
decided after many other Colored men
of political prominence had backed
back and refused to enter the fray, to
wade in and fight to the bitter end to
win tho contest for delegate to the
Republican National Convention from
tho First Congressional District of
Illinois.
It must be said to the credit" of Mr.
"Williams whether he wins out or not in
his fight for national delegate, that he
is no political tramp, that he has re
sided on the south side in this city for
many years, that ho possesses a suffi
cient amount of legal or business abil
ity to enable him to own or manage
good income property in his own name
the taxes on which amounts to more
than four hundred dollars per year and
that sum of money for taxes he digs up
out of his law business, which is con
clusive proof that ho is no political
tramp nor carpet bagger and that he
has the moral right to trail or run
after the political honors he is seeking
in that congressional district.
Alderman Oscar De Priest, will nat
urally become the commander in chief
of the solid or the united forces of
Congressman Martin B. Madden who
will arrive in this city shortly to assist
to direct the fight and those who will
march under his banner feel that they
already have the Hon. George H. Jack
son and his scattered forces on the
dead run, on the other hand Mr. Jack
son and those who have faith in him
and are willing to follow his leadership
feel that he will be able to snatch or
grab the second ward committeeship
away from the Hon. Martin B. Madden
Tuesday, April 11.
James T. Brewington, James Hale
Porter and Lawyer Adolph Marks
two of those distinguished gentlemen
being Colored and one White are fight
ing among themselves like maddened
demons to win or gain the honor of
being elected a member of the Bepub
lican state committee of Illinois and
Mr. Brewington loudly states from the
corners of the streets and other places
in that district that if Col. James Hale
Porter, would only step aside in favor
of him that he would be able to out
run the White man, and Mr. Porter
claims that if Mr. Brewington would
only pull out in his favor that he could
do the same thing so there you are as
the old Colored man said once upon a
time while he was engaged in address
ing a very important political meeting.
"Habeas-corpus" William G. Ander
son, Independent Bepublican candidate
for alderman of the second ward, see
announcement in another column of
this paper, and his friends and backers
contend that he is in the running in
dead earnest, that he will rush through
that ward like a streak of chain light
ening or wild fire; that he will make
it mighty interesting from now on un
til the aldermanic polls close Tuesday,
April 4, for Alderman Hugh Norris and
Harry Hildreth, Jr.
CATHOLICS AND NEGROES.
The Attitude of the Catholic Church
Toward Us.
To Bring About Complete Emancipa
tion. Six Negro' Priests in America
-Cathedral In Panama Built by Negro.
Los Angeles, Cal. "The Church and
the Negro' ' is the caption of an article
written by Walter F. McEntire, one of
the ablest and most prominent attor
neys of this city, and published in
"The Tidings," the magazine publish
ed as the official organ of the Catholic
diocese of Los Angeles.
The attitude of the Catholic Church
toward the Neero is treated by Mr.
McEntire in an exhaustive manner, and
ho cites many facts of interest con
cerning the race's relation with that
church in the United States. The arti
cle advances the opinion that the mis
sion of the Catholic Church embraces
the complete emancipation of the Ne
gro and the giving to him of his place
and standing in the human family. One
of the factors in the church for the
carrying out of this idea is the Cath
olic Board for Mission Work Among
the Colored People of which His Emi
nence, James Cardinal Gibbons, Arch
'bishop of Baltimore, is honorary presi
dent and the Et. Eev. Mgr. John E.
Burke of New York is director gener
al. Mr. McEntire has been and still is
engaged in making an investigation as
to Negro priests in the church, and
brings out the fact that the Bt. Eev.
Francisco Javier Luna Victoria y Cas
tro, bishop of Panama in 1751, after
wards transferred to Trujillo, Peru, was
the first Negro native-born bishop on
this continent. In 1902, he states, the
late Pope Leo XTTT restored the diocese
of Marianna, Amazon, Brazil, with a
population of 2,000,000 souls, designated
a Negro, tho Et. Eev. Silvera Gomez
Pimentar as its bishop. The cathe
dral now standing in Panama was built
by the first-named bishop with funds
from his private purse.
BROKER FLEES WITH DAUGHTER.
Evansville. Ind., (Special) Clifton
Yarorouh, the wealthy grain broker
of Pulaski, Tenn., who made' an at
tempt in tho Circuit Court here re
cently to havo Eugenia Murray, a Mu
latto girl, aged 17 years, adopted, say
"g that ho was the girl's father, has
disappeared, and the officials here do
nt know where he is.
Tho Murray girl, who came here
th her mother, Alice Murray, a Col
ored woman, on February 7, is also
ng, and the supposition is that
8he has gono with her self-confessed
White father. It is believed that Yar
bdrough has taken the girl into some
other state and will make another ef
fort to adopt her. "
Another theory is that Yarborough
has taken the girl to Nashville, Tenn.,
to place her again in Fisk University,
a school for Colored girls. It is un
derstood the girl spent more than a
year in this school.
The mother of Miss Murray is still
in the city, but she refuses to talk
about tho disappearance of Yarborough
and the girl.
"THE PAPERS AND THE BOOKS."
There are many papers and books
published in the United States each
year; all of them in their own way
tell or sing the same old thing, to-wit:
The White man's unlawful, unjust and
unwarranted treatment of the Black
man. The Crisis being the most con
spicuous in telling to the world the
crimes that are daily perpetrated upon
the people of African descent in the
United States. The world knows that
what they say is true, but the world
is looking and waiting for the remedy.
The remedy must come from the race
or people that needs it. The lack of
practical steps taken on the part of
the black is a manifestation that he
is satisfied with his treatment and
present condition. There is a remedy.
Bead the Pioneer and act according
ly. The African Pioneer, March 1.
The Times does not see the condi
tions as above expressed by the Pio
neer. It is the opinion of The Times
that many of the wrongs upon our
people in certain parts of the United
States are due more to the fact of not
enough of political and financial pow
er among oar people to be used in op
position, as it has -been shown that
many of the crimes, injustices, etc.,
against us have been by hatred .and

conspiracies to discourage the race's
progress. Then, with such facts and
others. The Times thinks the Colored
people have been greatly benefitted by
having all such publications telling of
the many injustices, etc., for their
position has won thousands and thou
sands of White people, who have come
to our side. Things are bad enough
in parts of this country against the
Colored people, but had it not been for
the sentiment of the race publications
things would be a great deal worse.
Because Colored citizens don't get up
on tho housetops and yell against
overy mean act or outrage against
them as a race is not -sufficient or
broad enough reason for belief they
are satisfied, as many of them havo
a boiling spirit, but for tho lack of
power they make the best of the con
ditions and go on working and praying,
hoping for better. To just read the
Pioneer and act accordingly. The
Times don't agree, because that sug
gestion is selfish and will not give
the remedy no more than to just read
the New York Age, the Indianapolis
Freeman. Dallas Express, the Texas
Freeman, San Antonio (Texas) In
quirer, Chicago Broad Ax,, the Bee of
Washington, D. C, the New Idea, the
Amsterdam News of New York, or
any one of the many other papers of
the race, nor even the Crisis Magazine

LEADERS OF BAR PRONOUNCE
BBANDEIS UNFIT FOR BENCH.
Taft and Six Other Former Heads of
American Association Send Protest
to Senate.
Washington, D. C, (Special) For
mer President Taft and six other for
mer presidents of the American Bar
Association have protested to the sen
ate judiciary subcommittee against
confirmation of the nomination of Louis
D. Brandeis for the Supremo Court.
The others were Simeon E. Baldwin,
Francis Eawle, Joseph H. Choate, Elihu
Boot, Moorfield Story, and Peter W.
Meldrim.
The first six sent a letter stating that
thoy felt "under tho painful duty to
say to you that, in their opinion, tak
ing into view the reputation, character,
and professional carder of Mr. Louis
D. Brandeis, he is not a fit person to
be a member of the Supreme Court of
the United States."
OOLOBED MEN CANNOT USE
SHBJNEBS' NAME.
Atlanta, Ga., (Special) The State
Supreme Court has upheld a temporary
injunction granted, in Fulton Superior
Court on behalf of the Arab Temple
of the "Ancient Arabic Order of the
Nobles of the Mystic Shrine," a Ma
sonic organization using the- name
"Ancient Egyptian, Arabic Order of
.Nobles-of the Mystic Shrine of North
and South America." The case now
is to go' before a Fulton County petit
jury .for decision of the facts.
CATHOLIC CHUBCH'S- STAND ON ,
COLOR IN THE SOUTH.
"The extent to which the Catholic
Church softens race prejudices was
forcingly illustrated in New Orleans,
La., a few days ago. At the funeral
of a priest who had belonged to an
old Louisiana family and who had de
voted his life to work among Colored
Catholics, a Negro Priest was celebrant
of the mass, while the deacon and sub
deacon were White priests. What other
religious body could have dared thus
to ignore the fierce prejudices that ob
tains south of Mason and Dixon's
Line."
THE PHYLLIS WHEATLY HOME
SUCCEEDED IN RAISING $1,000
IN ITS BEOENT FINANCIAL CAMPAIGN.

of this paper of February 28, the aims
and objects of the Ph'yllis Wheatly
Home, 3256 Bhodes avenue, and its or
igin was fully set forth in these col
umns. It was also announced that $1000
was badly needed to make a payment
on tho home which would reduce its
indebtedness down to $6,500 and
through the appeal made in these col
umns and the untiring efforts of Mrs.
Clara Studymire, Mrs. J. Snowden
Porter, Mrs. Jessie Johnson and its
other active members, the $1,000 has
been raised and paid over to the owner
