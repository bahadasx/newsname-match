as clearly Indicating that Villa and hl8tory of copR(
a iiuuuiiB uii! iit-ciiig iM.'ioro me
American ndvnncc nnd that It was ex
tremely doubtful that thoy would at
tempt to mnko n stand. Tim opinion
prevailed among nrmy officers that
tho campaign would develop Into n
guerilla warfare If nny opposition at
all dovelopcd. Tho War Department
lind no confirmation of border reports
thnt snipers had fired on the American
troops.
In the Senate yesterday a concur
rent resolution by Senator LaFollcttc,
declaring that Congress npproved the
use or tho nrmy to pursue Villa nnd
giving further assurances that the
sovereignty of Mexico was not to be
encronched upon by tho punitive ex
pedition, was unanimously ndopted
without debate.
Dispatches from Columbus, N M.,
reported Intense activity at tho Ameri
can military base. They said fresh
troops were being sent forward across
the border both night and day nnd that
one ncroplane had nlready Joined the
forces In Mexico. Seven other air
craft are circling over tho border con
stantly on scouting expeditions.
With the practical certainty that the
American soldiers had at least reached
the Villa territory questions of nb
sorbing Interest on tho border Is how
many men Villa has and will he fighl
or run. Americans from tho Casas
Grandes region assert that the peons
they are certain to support Villa, part
ly through his system of terrorism and
partly through the glamor of his r
putntlon as a warrior.
Americans who know Villa and th
country In which ho hns taken refuge
equally are confident that he will at
tempt to check his pursuers by o
guerilla campaign. J
