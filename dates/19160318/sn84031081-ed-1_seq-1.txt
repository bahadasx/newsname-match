IRV UORNINS JOURNAL IRICIAL LIAIIO WflRt)
Washington, March 17. The main
American expeditionary force 'n
Mexico, as late as this afternoon, had
encountered none of Villa's outlaws.
Uepnrts to ibis effect were received
by the war department in field wire
less messages relayed by telegraph
from a point along the international
border.
officials Interpreted the Informa
tion as clearly indicating that Villa
and his bandits were fleeing before
the American advance and that it was
extremely doubtful that they would
attempt to make a stand. The opin
ion prevailed among army officers
that the campaign would develop
Uiiickly into a guerrilla warfare, if
any opposition at all developed. The
war department had no confirmation
of border reports that snipers had
fired on the American troops.
Senate's Tactful Action.
In the senate today a concurrent
resolution by Senator LaFollette de
claring that congress approved th"
use of the army to pursue Villa and
giving further assurances that the
sovereignty of Mexico was not to be
ftneroached upon by the punitive ex
pedition was unanimously adopted
without debate.
Reports to the state and war de
partments indicated that conditions
generally in the Interior of Mexico
were fairly iiulet.
Some I n rest, on Itordcr.
General Funston reported in one
dispatch that there was some excite
ment at various points along the fron
tier, in another he said trains south
bound from the border carried only
a few passengers. Other dispatches
received from him were of purely
routine character, It was said authori
tatively. Consular advices to the state de
partment were to the effec t that quiet
prevailed in virtually all sections of
Mexico, with the exception of Tarn
pico and Torreon.
Hostile at Tamploo.
At Tamploo and in the adjacent oil
fields Americans were reported to bo
uneasy although no disorders had de
veloped. The attitude of the military
forces in the district Is said to be un
favorable to Americans. It is believ
ed, however, that when the acquies
cent atlilude of the de facto govern
ment toward the campaign against
Villa becomes known there will bono
further cause for apprehension. The
situation in Tampioo is not a new one
and is not a direct result of the de
termination of the I'nited States to
capture Villa.
Torreon Disorderly.
Torreon has for some time been a
seat of disorder. Consul Williams,
who left his consulate at Torreon In
charge of the Hritish vice consul and
returned to the border with a party
of Americans, reported to the state
department late today that he had
quit his post because of unbearable
conditions.

San Antonio. Tex., March 17. Cal
culalions about army headquarters:
hero today indicated that General
Pershing soon will he in position to
re-divide his regiments and from near
the heart of the region where Villa
has been operating begin a systematic
search for him. Official reports to
General Funston gave assurances that
there had been no clash between
Americans and any band of Mexicans
and that the routine of the march had
not been disturbed.
It was estimated that Colonel Dodd,
who crossed the international bound
ary line at 1 o'clock Thursday morn
ing forty-five miles from Ilaohita, N.
M., was tonight close by, if not ac
tually in touch with the heavier and
slower column led in Wednesday by
General Pershing. It yvas intended
that the more mobile force of Colonel
Dodd should effect a juncture with
I ho first division, after which Colonel
Dodd's lav.'ilr.y would he sent on rec
onnaissance work, utilizing also the
services of American cowboys, who
have Joined the column, and other
scouts.
General Pershing continued to hold
his line, of communication today, re
porting at intervals as lo his position
and the slate of his troops. His wire
less set was used and couriers to the
border brought more detailed infor
mation. The direct wire from the
border carried the messages to Gen
eral Funston's headquarters. It waa
said today that General Pershing
probably would supplement his field
lines of communication with a tele
phone line that would be extended as
he proceeded.
Failure of any body of Mexicans to
oppose the Americans and reports
(hat General f'albs was using hiii men
to fortify the passes that lead from
the state of Chihuahua into the state
of Sonora. served to dispel somewhat
the feeling common in many quarters
that not all the Carranza garrisons
would co-operate in the chase of Vil
la. . .
There prevails here a heller that an
.mounter with Villa is not probable
for some days. His exact whereabouts
Is not known, but he l believed by
most persons to be In the mountains
not far from Casus Grandes district
towards which the Americans are
moving and against which the Oar

"In other words," the letter added,
"the only immediate effect or the

lie to increase Hie regular army by

being added In four annual Incre
ments, would require about four years;
time to be recruited and a si ill longer
