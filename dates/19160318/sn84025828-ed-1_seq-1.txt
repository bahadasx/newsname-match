SANITARYDOTRICTWINS
Its Boundaries Are Extended and
the People Will Benefit by It.
Citizens will be glad to learn that
the sanitary district may legally ex
tend Its boundaries to Include the
north shore villages, such as Wllmette
and Qlencoe, and may use the Chicago
river as a, channel to carry out tho
sewage of the annexed district if it
compiles with tho state law, which
provides that a flow of 20,000 cubic
feet of water per minute be maintained
for cuch 100,000' people "living In tho
toirltory tributary to the said river."
This, In brief, Is tho conclusion
reached by Assistant Corporation
Counsel Cressy and approved by Cor
poration Counsel Ettelaon to-day.' Tho
opinion wan sent to Aid. W. J. Healy,
chulrman of the commission on down
town mun'clpal Improvements.
Aid. Healy also asked the following
question:
"Does not the Introduction of sew
ago from cities and villages outsldo of
Chicago into tho north, shore channel
militate against the Interests of Chi
cago?" The corporation counsel replied:
"I am of the opinion that the greator
benefit which is derived by the city of
Chicago at large by reason of the pro
venting of the contamination of lis
water supply by the sewage of the
north shore towns Is superior to tho
detriment done to the north' branch,
and that the Introduction of sewage
from cities and villages outsldo of Chi
cago does not militate against the In
terests of tho city of Chicago.'

That South Shore plan Is still In

bringing tho city and tho railroad com

south park commissioners have an
agreement, but the federal govern

by the city Itself.
TAXED TO DEATH
People of Chicago Taxed to the
Limit to Provide Places
for Reformers.
Giving women salaries of $5,000 a
year to preside over fad departments;
paying women superintendents S3.000
a year to assist them; paying female
stenographers $150 por month whllo
capable men and heads of families are
tramping the streets looking for work,
Is part of tho net result of tho work
of "reforms" in tho City Council for
tho past five years. Tho other not re
sult and the one that hurts the most,
Is the increaso of the number of em

coming from tho people and spent on
salaries for city employes,' from
twenty-four millions to over thirty-five
millions.

This Spring.
Mayor Thompson authorized tho cir

aldermanlc election.
Tho park consolidation act passed

provides that tho proposition must

'REFORMERS"
The Fad Leaders and Sob Sisters
Constantly Suggesting New
Methods of Robbing
Taxpayers.
Tho law ought to be amended so
that professional reformers could be
jailed without trial overy time they
discovered a new fad.
Professional reformers are bohlr.d
tho robbery of tho taxpayers of Chi
cago. Taxes were never so high as they
are now and nre still going up.
Reformers nre still flocking to Chi
cago to pluck tho Industrious peoplo
and to fill high salaried but unneces
sary Jobs created for them.
Public Welfare!
Public morals!!
Civil sorvlco! 1 1
What extortion and robbery of tax
payors is committed in those names,
Jobs for women reformers.
Jobs for malo reformers.
Jobs for professional reformers.
And tho Chicago taxpayer pays the
freight.
Tho City Council Is full of useless
men. It Is a useless body. It docs no
good and la responsible- for tho creat
ing of costly jobs to gratify fads.
It Is time tho people woko up and
called a halt on this saturnalia of ex
travagance. Ten million dollars a year could bo
saved to tho city by tho abolition of
useless jobs.
When the drys triumph next spring
as they Bay they will, Chicago taxpay
er! will have to make up this deficit
of 17,000,000 out of their own pocket.
