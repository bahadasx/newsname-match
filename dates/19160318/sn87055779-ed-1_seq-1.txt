TO OCCUPY
Establishment of Base in Mex
ican City Would be Misin
terpreted by People.
International News S"rvbe:
WASHINGTON, March 18. Offic
ials made it plain today that the re
quest of Gen. Gavlera, the Carran
zista commander at Juarez that the
American expedition do not occupy
any Mexican cities or towns, is con
sidered reasonable. It is known
that the establishment of a base in
J a Mexican city by the American
forces would certainly be misunder
stood by the Mexican people. To
avoid this it is expected that the ex
peditionary forces will give all cities
and towns a wide berth in their
progress toward the south.
It is not expected that any real
i information regarding the plans of
the American forces will be forth
coming here for .several days. The
censorship put into effect by the
general staff, as represented by Capt.
Cootes, is absolute so far as In
formation regarding troop move
ments is concerned. This is at the
request of Gen. Funston, who takes
the position that the news should
come through his headquarters as
he is les; aide to determine what
should or should not be punished.
one tiling that officials seem
agreed upon, however, is that Villa
will not be captured alive. As a
matter of tact this government will
much prefer him dead inasmuch as
if caught alive the New Mexico
authorities would be certain to de
mand him for trial as responsible
1 for the Goltihibus killings, while
arranza onilil le depended on to
insist that he he turned over to his
J troops for court martial and to face

otlicials who are perfectly familiar
with conditions to believe that some
of the bandit leader's own men will
he the ones to "get him." The re
wards method has frequently been
resorted to on the border to get
bandits and when the purse is made
large enough it never fails to suc
ceed. State department officials pointed
out today that the situation in the
Tain pico district. where serious
troul.de is feared, is not new. Tor
reon and Tuxpam have been the
scene of disorder? and this is duo
to the fart that Carranza has not
yet made any effort to get control
of this section. It is understood
that the attention of the first chief
has been called to the situation
there and that he has promised that
troops will lie sent to that region
immediately.
In general the situation through
out Mexico is described by the de
partment as "fairly satisfactory."

II AGITATION
FOR AN EMBARGO
Action Sure to Follow Great
Britain's Prohibition of
Imported Luxuries.
International News " Service :
WASHINGTON". March 18. Re
newal of the aeitatlon xfor an em
bargo on munitions is certain to fol
low the expected action of Great
Britain in prohibiting imports of
articles that are to be placed under
the head of "luxuries." These will
include hundreds of articles of
American origin or manufacture.
Inasmuch a-s the expected order Is
to be made to apply to all countries,
officials say there will te no ground
for any official protest by the United
States. But it is expected that the
opposition will be reflected by an
other attempt to secure congressional
action through embargo legislation.
The feeling against the Birtish
trade interference, which has been
held in check because of the de
velopments in the submarine con
troversy with the central powers, is
growing very rapidly in both tho
senate and the house. The south
ern members have been almost a
unit for action and now it is ex
pected that their position will be
strengthened by support from rep
resentatives of the districts where
interests will be affected by the
new order.
The text of the AnPlo-I'rench de
cision dealing with the mails con
troversy is expected here early next
week. It is a complete refusal of
all of the American demands and is
expected to further complicate the
situation.
So far as the new developments in
the submarine situation are concern
ed officials say that until all reports
regarding the attempted torpedoing
of th" French liner Patria and the
sinking of the Dutch steamer Tu ban -tia
are received no further action
will bo taken. The state department,
although it has made public the al
leged svet orders of tho British
admiralty to commanders to sink
submarines on sight, will take no ac
tion on this phase of the ques-tion
until the official British orders, al
ready asked for are furnished it by
the British embassy.

Over Tubantia.
International News Service:
I3NDON, March 18. All Amer
ican on board the Dutch liner. Tu
bantia which waa sunk in the North
sea on Thursday, were saved.
The list, of missing has been re
duced to four.
The Dutch foreign oflice, convinced
that the'liner was sent to the bot
tom by a torpedo, is reported to
have begun work upon a strong pro
test which will be sent lo the Oer-
man government and will peremptor
ily demand an explanation.
It is denied in Berlin that the
Tubantia was sunk by a "U" boat.
The foregoing were the outstand
ing features today in the story of
the loss of the fine Dutch ship.
A Central News dispatch from
Amsterdam stated that all the pas
sengers of the Tubantia were saved
and that if any faltalities attended
the destruction of the ship the vic
tims would be proven to be seamen.
, Valuable diplomatic documents
owned by South American diplomats
who were on their way home were
lost.
It is estimated that the los of the
ship together with her cargo, mails
and the baggage of her passengers
will aggregate $4,500.000.
The greatest indignation exists
throughout Holland. Most of the
Dutch newspapers have abandoned
the theory that the Tubantia was
struck by a drifting mine and take
it for grarted she was torpedoed.
The Neue Vander Tag of Amster
dam says;
"We are compelled to recall Ger
many's premise to the United States
not to torpedo passenger boats. We
expect the United States will con
sider the Tubantia affair a viola
tion of that promise."
The Handelblad of Amsterdam
says:
"We demand that the Dutch gov
ernment firmly support the United
States in its efforts to bring Ger
many to a better conception of its
duty to neutrals."
BERLIN. March IS. German of
ficials today reiterated their belief
that the Dutch liner Tubantia struck
a mine. They declare that the in
structions to submarine command

that thf Tnglish claims that the

Berlin lewspapers take the view
that it lljibably was not even a Ger
