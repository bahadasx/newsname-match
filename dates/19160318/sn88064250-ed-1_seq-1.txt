PLEASANT AND PARKER HEADQUARTERS ARE OPENED IN THIS

THOUGHTOUT ST. LANDRY
Both political parties are busy
in every precinct in the parish and
it is expected. 1tiat by the time the
election day rolls around the two
forces will have been effectively
organized for the fray.
Democratic Headquarters have
been opened in the Landau build

are kept busy greeting visitors from
the country, mailing out political
"dope" and managing the work of
organization.
The Parker headquarters are di
rectly across the courthouse square
in the Boagni building, on Bellevue
street, and are being supervised by
James Bailey, an ardent Parker ad
mirer.
The Parker forces were busy dur

MRS. THOMAS IL LEWIS IS
CALLED TO HER REWARD
Venerable Old Lady, Member of
Aristocratic Family Dies After
Beautiful Life
"Let thq bell toll; another noble
soul has crossed the Stygain river."
Mrs. Thos. H. Lewis, venerable
widow of the late illustrious Thos.
H. Lewis, died at her residence in
this city on last Tuesday evening
at 6:30 o'clok.
Mts. Lewis was born in Raptdies.
parish ~ ievnty-seven years Ago.She
was tihd daughter of Josiah atid
Marie ". Williams and belonged to
lone of tih, molt noted families in
the state. Her people were among
those who contributed to miake Ails
tory in this seti~n. A >vr the death
6f her husband Mrs.Williams ca.ie
to Opelotusas to reside with her
daughte,; Mrs. Lewis. She lived here
until her' death flifteen years ago.
Mrs. Marie Bl. Williams belonged to
the flower of aristocracy, and was'
a woman of rare intellect--she was
a regular contribu'tor to the Youth's
Companion and other publications
of note, and was regarded as one
of the most famous authors of her
itme.
In the death of Mrs. Lewis the
poor have lost a good friend.TTh best
part of this venerable woman's life
was sp^rt in doing charitable deeds
and in assisting the needy, regard
less of creed, color or station. She
was richly endowed with the vir
tues and qualities that make up one
of God's most noble creatures. She
was estemed, she was highly res
pected, she was loved by all who
knew her.
Mrs. Lewis' home life was beauti
ful; she devoted her ,life to the
happiness of her children and hus
band. "
'Up to the time of her death,
though still beautiful, tender and
kind, after the death of her devoted
husband, two years ago, her heart
was broken,--the Jonging for that
companionship of fifty years' dura
tion was to great for one who has
long passed the meridian of life-
and she has gone to meet him.
Mr. and Mrs Lewis had been
as a very efectionate pair, always
devoted to one anot~er during their
long period of married life: the wife
clung to the husband like a vine to
a towering oak and when the tree
died the vine slowly withered away.
Interment took place in the Pro
testant cemetery and a very large
number of friends of the Lewis
family attended to pay their last
respects to one of the noblest wo
men that ever resided here.
Besides her immediate family and
relative Mrs.. Lewis leaves a large
number of friends to mourn her
loss.
To the bereaved family the Clarion
extends its most heart-felt sympa
thy in their hour of tribulation.

The present Orton family, now

were literally born upon horseback.
Riding from infancy, taught by
their distinguished parents, they
were perfect at ten years of age,
when they were sent to school for
their education. During their col

their skill, but aided them in ac

MAYOR LOEB TO URiE
PUBLIC CITY PARK
CITY'S CHEIF EXECUTIVE BELIEVES THAT OPELOUSAS SHOULD
HAVE A PUBLIC PARK WHERE THE CITIZENS COULD
ENJOY SUMMER
Mayor Edward L. Loeb is of the
opinion that Opelousas should own
its park, and acting accordingly is
preparing to submit a plan to the
city council at some future date,
whereby a public park could be
erected and maintained here.
"I believe that the people of
Opelousas will agree with me," said
Mayor Loeb "that a public park is
much in demand here; it would be
a great addition to our prosperous
and progressive city. It is my plan
to urge the city council to adopt
a measure, whereby we can estab
lish a public park, where our citi
zens could assemble during the sum
mer and enjoy themselves. I fur
ther believe that hlu: park can be
made self-sustaining.
Nearly all of the Louisiana cities
in the class of Opelousas are main
taining public parks with success
and it is believed that the park pro
posed by Mayor Loeb will equal
any place of its kind in the smaller
"cities of this state.
Opelousas has grown to such an
extent that it is time for its cit
izens to see about establishing susli
things as parks, where the grown

IN MEMORY OF D.M. JR,
As loved ones,their silent vigil kept
Around the dying bed,
The Angel came, an Baby slept,
For Baby's soul had "fled." :
His little form of waxen clay,
Still lay before them all,
But. Baby's soul had flowa away,
And triumphed over all.
That precious soul will never die,
But live on, and on, and on;
In that bright home,beyond the sky,
With Christ the Blessed One,
I know 'twas hard to give him up,
And see him pass away,
Hard, hard to drain the bitter cup,
,Twas handed you that day. d
Grieve not for him,oh parents,dear,
Your baby, is now at rest.
Ip that bright home of "Over-there"
Redeemed among the blest.
Fair. as the lily by his side,
Was Bab'y waxen brow,
My heart did ache, my spirit cried,
"Oh jesus help them now.' '
But "all things work together for
good,
To those who love the Lord,"
You love Him, that is understood,
So trust His Holy Word.
The Angel will come again,some day
Will you be ready then,
To leave your temple made of clay,
And go to meet D. M.?
He's "safe in the arnms o; Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o'er shaded,
Sweetly his soul will rest.

to saunter in such fascinating
places. These amusements will be
made to maintain the park and the
people of this place will enjoy
high class amusements at very low
costs, if the plans of Mayor Loeb
should materialize, as it is believed
they will.
In a public park Opelousas will
be able to offer visitors an ideal
place for summer, and with the
many improvements to be made
here during the not too distant fut
ure it is expected that this city
will become known some day as a
famous summer resort.
There are many. beautiful spots
in this historic old Indian town
which would make ideal parks,and
there is no doubt that, in the event
