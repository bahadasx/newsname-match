SIGNS OF TROUBLE AHEAD
Chamberlain Measure Much Dif
ferent and Mann Declares
House Bill Too Mild .
Congress today got some inkling
of the fierce and confused struggle
it has,, entered upon in framing
preparedness legislation
Endorsement by the President,
of the Hay bill, was announced by
, the author from the floor of the
House.
"It's his bill," said Mr. Hay.
. At about the same moment the
Senate Military Affairs Commit
tee O. K'd and reported to the
Sonatc the Chamberlain bill, ut
terly different from Hay's dif
ferent in principle, as wel as form.
And Republican Leader Mann
taking the floor in the House,
sounded radical objections to the
President's plan, forecasting as ho
did so the minority party's oppo
sition.
MOORE RAISES QUESTION.
Congressman J. Hampton Moor of
Pennsylvania Informod Miv 1ly that
Secretary Daker'a letter hae! left mem
bers on doubt as to whether the Ad
ministration la behind the bill at the
Military Affairs Commlttco which calls
for a star.dlnK army of 140,000 men,
Federalization of the Natlonnl Guard,
and other administrative reforms to In
crease tho efficiency of the army.
"I am authorized to state' by tho
President that this bill meets his ap
proval," said Chairman Hay. "In other
words. It la his bill. It carries out the
recommendations ho mads to Congress
In hla mcssaRc. In fact. It koos a lit
tle further than the President asked us
to pro.
"It Is truo that the bill doe not con
tain tho continental army feature. But
the Presldept In sujfgestlnK tho conti

of machinery to make tho land forces of
peace available In time of war
"He thinks that this bill makes tho
national guard a sufficient force In
time of peace to be available as a fluht
Inn force In time of war. I may say In
broad lancuane that this Is the Presi
dent's bill, and ho thoroughly ap
proves of It."
Mr. Hay said he understood the
figures In Secretary Bakers' letter were
obtained from tho War Colleco, while
those offered by Mr. Hay In his report
came from tho adjutant general.
"I will not discuss," said Mr. Hay,
"why the War Colleco undertook to
mako an argument aKalnst the figures
of tho adjutant general. I am saying. In
broad terms, this this pending bill Is the

First Villa Clash
To Test Loyalty
Skirmish Will Settle Question of
Mexican Co-operation With
American Troops.
DOUGLAS, Arizona. March 18. Ameri
can troops In Mexico today faced a
crisis In tho possibility of a skirmish
with Mexicans.
Mining1 men and ranchers who know
Mexico thoroughly, declared that tho
first clash between the expeditionary
forces and Vlllfsta bandits would be the
supremo test of tho grudging co-operation
of some of tho Carrunza soldiers
as well an of the. peons.
If tho predicted uprising ngnlns tho
"Invaders" Is to come, it will bo over
tho distorted nows of Americans killing
Moxlcaus on their own soil,
That General Pershing's two columns
aro moving faster than flrst reported,
waa tho prevailing impression here.
Settlers arriving In Agua Prleta from
El Tlgro heard that tho Columbus and
Hachlta divisions had Joined forces be
tween Guzman and Ascenclon.
It was persistently reported that Villa
had divided his command, leaving a
Btrong forco to give buttlo to tho Amerl-
can vanguard anil draw them off his
trail.
While reports of the friendliness be
tween tho du facto troops uittl Ameri
cans were widely circulated, friction be
tweon Mexicans and customs ofllcluls at
the international boundary hero waa
noticeable.
All Ccrranza troops at Aeua Prleta,
except a small garrison, havo been
moved to points along the Nacozarl rail
road, mkin miles south,
Itepnrts of Insiiburiliuutlon among tho
truops concentrated nt I'uliullont wore
discredited by C'urranza officials.
Allied Aviators

French Fliers Attack

PARIS, March IS.-Frcnch aviators
made five great raids on German cltle
and Important positions last night, and
engaged In thirty-two duel along tho
Verdun front, tho wai offlco reported
this afternoon.
Tho lliltlfh activities In twenty-four
hours havo been almost without prec
edent In oorlal warfaic.
Hovcntecn or eighteen Aeroplanes at
tacked tho railway station at Con
flans, through which tho crown prince
draws a lai-fo part of his supplied for
tho Verdun offensive. They dropped
forty big bombs.
Another French squadron of fourteen
fliers attacked tho Hnbloma station at
MeU. Threo fires broke out In th
station Jtself mid numtioiig explosions
occurred alonit tho railway.
Another FUnch air flotilla dropped
ten bombs on the German aerodromo ut

GERMAtTOFRENSE
GROWING WEAKER
Many Attacks Made Without
Sufficient Artillery Prepara
tion, Dispatches Say.
BERLIN, March ;8. The
German offensive around Verdun
' has Blackened because of weather
conditions, the war office an
nounced this afternoon. On the
entire west front a thick mist
has hindered operations.
LONDON, March 1.-Markcd slack
ening In tho violence of the German as
saults around Verdun has convinced
soma French military critics that tho
Crown Prlnco Is about to abandon tho
offensive.
This conviction waa expressed for the
first time In several dispatches from
Paris today. Coupled with it waa the
hint that final defeat for the Germans
at Verdun will bo followed shortly by
a great French offensive.
All Par Is dispatches reported that the
Germans aro showing less spirit in at
tack than In the early days of tho
Verdun offensive. Som of the assaults
arc being made with little artillery
preparation. J. no uermans. runs ra-
port.. .aro. jiot, standing ground imderJ
i'Tcncn counier-attacKs as in tno first
days of tho struggles around Douau
mont and Vnux.
Risk Grand Assault.
The belief that the crown prlnco is
preparing to quit tho offensive is not
shared by military men hort. Tho Ger
many, they said, havo pressed forward
to positions of such character that their
withdrawal at this tlmok could only bo
effected with very heavy losses. Thoy
bclicvo the crown prlnco will risk n
grand assault on all tho Verdun posi
tions before admitting defeat.
German newspapers which printed
lengthy articles aDout tho Verdun oattio
In Its early stages, have carried only
brief dispatches from their correspond
ents In the past ten days. Neutral ob
servers have been forced to rely upon
Paris acounU of tho fighting, which re
port that the Germans have been check
ed with very heavy losses.

Americans in Southern Republic if
Popular Feeling is Inflamed
By Villa Expedition.
SITUATION AT TAMPIC0 IS AGUTE
Thousand American Citizens and 150 English
Threatened; Only One Gunboat Now
In Harbor; Marines Rushed To
Florida For Emergency
SAN ANTONIO, Mardji 18. Colonel Dodd's
Column is now within thirty miles of Villa's forces in
the Galeana district, according to latest information
at General Funston's headquarters. An engagement
if Villa decides to make a stand, may occur within a
few hours.
Tenative plans for joint action by the army and navy
i nthe event of anti-American outbreaks on the east and
west coasts of Mexico are believed to have been discussed
at a conference held today at the Navy Department be
tween Secretary of War Baker and Secretary of the Navy
Daniels.
"" OrTicials of the Government are making no secret of
the fact that the conditions at Tampico are.causing them
serious concern.
More than 1,000 American men, women, and chil
dren are in the oil well districts around the seaport. In
addition to these there are about 150 Englishmen with
(heir families.
The feeling toward these foreigners on the part of the
Carranza garrison is' reported to be ugly. While there
have been no overt acts committed, the Mexicans are re
ported to be sullen.
The American consul has reported his apprehensions
concerning the possibilities of an outbreak should the Mex
icans become convinced that the Pershing expedition into
northern Mexico afte rVilla is the forerunner of a general
invasion.
MEXICANS May be armed.
In Mexican circles in Washington the fear is plainly
expressed that distorted reports concerning the purposes
of the expedition may at any time inflame the populace ir,
particular localities.
At the present time the navy's only representative at
Tampico is the gunboat Machias. To what extent this
vessel will serve to keep the garrison in control is doubtful.
There are no British or German warships there aj
there were in April, 1914, and it is feared the Mexicans
still remember the fact that when American colonists at
Tampico were threatened with massacre then, it was not
the squadron of Rear Admiral Mayo that protected them,
but the British and German warships who threatened to
blow up the town after Secretary Daniels had peremptorily
ordered Mayo to leve.
Secretary Daniels announced yesterday that he had
ordered 500 marines to proceed to Pensacola, Fla., from
Philadelphia, for possible service in Mexico. The Atlantic
fleet is at the winter maneuvers off Guantanamo, three
days' run from Tampico, and there is also available Rear
Admiral Caperton's force of 1,000 marines now serving a
a police force in Hayti.
