Congressman (lardner Ques

in
Measure.
w
ASIIICVtiTOX, March 17. Na
tional defense legislation over
shadowed every other legislative is
sue today in both houses of congress.
The fact standing out most sharply
from a whole day of debute and dis
cussion was that only one voice had
been raised against military ptepar
eilness as a national policy thut of
Meyer London of New York, the only
Socialist member of congress.
The bouse completed more than
half of its set schedule of ten hours
remnil debute on the iirmy increase
bill More than two score members
expressed their views. The great ma
jority favored the committee bill
which is the must, sweeping mllitury
measure ever considered In the
country in pence times. Many umend
inenls to be offered were announced,
howevei, inil the prospect of passing
the bill by tomorrow nlghi virtually
vanished. It may be late next week
before the final vote is taken.
In the senate Chairman Chamber
lain announced that be would seek to
have the military committee's perfect
id army bill taken up next Monday.
.Not a "olsy NoiM'"
The house bill was attacked sharp
ly today by Itepresenttive Gardner,
HcmtMican of Massachusetts. lie
declared that while "it makes a noise
like preparedness, it Is not a very
noisy noise." To support his ussaull
upon the figures us to what the bill
would accomplish, prepared by Rep
resentative Hay, Mr. Gardner read a
copy of a letter from Secretary linker,
the new head of the war department.
The letter disputed the accuracy of
the figures by which Mr. Hay sought
to show that I.324.7HO men would be
Im mediately available for a national
army it the house bill was enacted.
I 'sing the same method of calcula
tion as that employed by Mr. Hay, It
said "we should have now available
without any legislation 1,2X1, 7!K) men
who have had some military train,
ing."
Four Yeurs Needed.
"In other words," the letter added,
"the only Immediate effect of the pas
sage of the house urmy bill would be
to increase the regular army by forty
thousund men, and even that increase
being added in four annual Incre
ments, would require about four years
time to be recruited and a still longer
time to become effective."
The letter presented reports and
figures to support a conclusion that
the actual number of men of military
age In the country who have had any
military training at all Is 173,700.
"Tho only adequately trained men
In the country," it concluded, "are
tho regular urmy and the army re
serve." Attack Surprising.
The severity of this official araign
ment of the house bill astonished
many members. At the war depart
ment. Secretary Baker said there was
no controversy between Mr. Hay and
himself. The variance In figures, ho
explained, resulted from different
opinions held by officers of tho war
college, which supplied the informs

(iMo., March 1". (R p. m.
A far-reaching order in council
which will totally prohibit Importa
tion In to tho united kingdom of a
large number of articles which come
under the general heading of luxuries,
will be Issued by the British govern
ment at an early date.
Among the things which will hn
placed under the ball will be automo
biles foi privute use, musical instru
ments, cutlery of ull kinds, hardware,
nrns, chiiuiwure, fancy goods and
soaps. The order will apply equally
to all countries, including the Britisn
dominions and colonies.
Tills forecast of the coming order
In council was given to the Associat
ed Press today in nn Interview by
Walter Itiinclinan, president of tho
board ot trade. Mr. Runciman admit
ted that unifies In addition to those
rained would be placed on tho list
of prohibited Imports but in udvance
of the Issuance of the order, ho de
clined to say what they ure. He
agreed that the decree would have
considerable effect on exports from
the Cnited States but pointed out
that It applied to all countries alike
and declared It was absolutely neces
siiry to limit the shipment of bulky
luxuries In order to provide room till ,
ships for necessaries.
Mutter of Necessity
"But please remember," suid Mr.
Runciman. "thut the Issuance of this
order Is forced on (he country, not
us u mutter of policy, but entirely be
iii use of u shortage in tonnage. We
want exports from the I'nited S(ntes;
we want your wheat, cotton and meat
and we need other thinirs which we
cannot get if the space aboard ves
sels is taken up with luxuries.
iOvcrylhlng possible Is being done
to relieve (he shortage In ships. Every
ship living (he British flag Is now
controlled by the government. Im
mense numbers of theiu have been
requisitioned: others are subject to
direction by way of licenses. Wheth
er It will be necessary to requisition
more vessels, I cannot say but for my
own part 1 hope this will not be
done."
Mr. Runciman said the importation
of some fresh fruits probably would
be prohiibted later but he pointed out
that (bis would uffect the I'nited
States only slightly. Turning from the
matter of imports to the general in
dustrial situation in the British Isles.
Mr. Runciman said there never had
been greater activity in the larger in
dustries, that wages were higher than
ever before, and thut the percentage
of unemployed never hud been so
small in the History ot inc country.
Luxury Trades Quiet.
"In all the larger Industries," Mr.
Runciman continued, "there has
ne.-er been greater activity: hut tne
bulk of the output, of course, is for
war purposes. I lie only trades rela
tively qui'-t are the building, linen and
some of the luxury producing trades,
hut even in these there Is little un
employment, the working people eith
er having secured other employment
or gone Into the army. The amount of
short time Is comparatively small.
The proportion of unemployed in the
trades unions ut the present is about
one-half of one per cent. In normal
limes It Is about five per cent, und in
time of peace It has scarcely ever
fallen below two per cent. The same
condition prevails In the nonunion
trades.

JUDGMENT AGAINST
YUCATAN GOVERNOR
Must Pay liack to the Slate tin Sum
ot S I72.I1IMM New York Supreme
Court Itecldes
NKW YORK, March 17. The state
of Yucatan, Mexico, took Judgment in
the stute supreme court here today
for $472.01X1 against Abel Olitz Argu
medo. Its former governor, who now
lives In this city. An order ulso
was grunted restraining a safe deposit
company from permitting Arguniido
or hts agent to remove any part of
the contents of n vault hired by him.
The state of Yucatan contended that
Argumcdo fled from Mexico in March
of last vear, taking with him tho
equivalent of $447,000 In American
money which bclonired to the slate
and should be turned over to tho pres
ent government. It was for this
sum with accrued interest thut Judg
ment was granted.
Argumedo contended that he had
not been legally sueeecded by thu
Carranra governor who Is now in of
fice and said lie had Intended to hold
the money until he could turn It over
to the ' lawful government" of Yu
catan. The stat'1 argued in rebuttal
however, that Argutnedo had vacated
the office of governor according to
the unwritten constitution of Mexico
and Yucatan, when he left the counv
