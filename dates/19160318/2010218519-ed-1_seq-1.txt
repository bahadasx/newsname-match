H published a most strik-
U ing full-page cartoon
I by Marcus. It repre-
' sents Germany in the
picture of a woman
, leaning with her right
arm on a coffin and in
her left arm holding a
scroll, on the scroll is
. . printed: "List of the
dead at Verdun."
The kaiser is leaning
nearby on his sword,
looking sternly at the
woman and the legend
reads:
I "Kaiser: 'Think of
our gains!"
! Germany: "But
, think of the
I price!'"
And looking at it the
thought comes of how
t in millions of homes
from the most western
point in Ireland, across
the British isles, across
continental Europe, up
upon the "Volga the
Don, and down upon
the Danube and the
1 Dnieper around the
Hellespont and back
even to the banks of
the Indus and Eu
phrates, duplicate pic
tures of this woman in
the tremendous car
toon are seen and all
repeating the words:
"But think of the
price'"
As yet the spirit rep
resented by the helm
eted emperor and the
words: "But think of
our gain!" has ruled,
but how much longer
can it?
Soldiers can go into
battle and perish, but
how much longer can
the most iron hearts
bear to see the suffer
ing of the women and
children who are de
pendent upon them? It
cannot be very much
longer, for there are
limitations upon the
endurance of poor nit
man nature.
There are whispers

rN OBERT CAMPBELL GEMMELL, one of the most prominent and successful mining men in
J Utah, and for that matter, in the entire miring field, is a native of Pennsylvania, having
1K been born at Port Matilda, that state, on July 5, 18G3, the son of Robert Brown Gemmell
" and Anna Eliza Campbell Gemmell.
After attending the general schools he entered the University of Michigan, taking the course in

fession as a civil and mining engineer in Oregon, Washington and Utah, from 1890 to 189G. Follow

fighting armies, and if M
wo mistake not they M
aro beginning to ask M
each other, if all they M
hope to gain from the M
war can, even if real- M
ized, bo worth tho M
cost? And if it is manly H
to break any more M
women's hearts and M
begger the children of M
a dozen nations? And M
we wonder if the lead M
ers who are driving the M
soldiers up to the M
ghastly shambles daily M
are not beginning to M
have fears of the retri- H
bution that may soon M
be demanded of them. H
Have they no secret M
fears that order will H
soon vanish and chaos M
be ushered in? That it H
is possible- to set war H
in motion on a scale so M
tremendous that it will H
break of its own H
weight? H
Think what must be H
when all joy from all H
the homes of a dozen H
nations is crushed!
What gains could H
compensate for such a H
loss as that? H
Europe today must H
be as was Egypt on ;H
that fearful morning :H
on which there was not jH
one house in which ,H
there was not one H
dead, and the suffering H
is so terrible that it D
looks as though the H
war must soon break H
of its own weight. H
