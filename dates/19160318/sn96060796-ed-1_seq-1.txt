sented to the board, asking to
create a county road system de
scribed as follows:
1st. The present Elgin So-
noita road continuing from El
gin southeast to county line
along and near S. P. R. R. track,
allowing automatic gates and
cattle guards at grant line n
county sees fit.
2nd. The present road from
Elgin to the Rain Valley coun
try, instead of useless expense
to open another ioad.
3rd. On account of the pro
test of the present grantowners,
and lessee to the present upper
Canille-Elgin road, we would re
commend changing the upper
Canille - Elgin road where it
strikes the south line of the Ba
bacomari grant, to run along
ust south of line, east to where
the short or lower Canille-Elgin
road strikes said south grant
line, thence across the grant in
ope road running in a northerly
direction along the west line,
and just west of the Empire
pasture, to a point about due
south of Elgin, thence north,
down the big draw and straight
nto Elgin. ve recommend that
this road be made a lane, with
sufficient number of culverts for
drainage and stock passes. We
also recommend the changing of
this road at Freeman drough to
run about as the horse trail, to
top of Bald Hill making a nearly
straight road from Canille to
Elgin.
4th. We recommend the main
tenance of the road as mapped

E. running due south between
C. Creigh ton's and Ira Brooks

tion across Grant and intersect
ing the upper Canille road in the
