General Gavira's reported refusal to
permit the Americans troops pursuing
Francisco Villa to enter the Mexican
town of Casas Grandes revived '
doubt at Fort Sam Houston today of
the full co-operation of the defacto '
government forces. * , '
The announcement of General Ga-s

American troops had arrived almost!
at the outskirts of Casas Grandes and
planned to enter the town during the
night was the first news received* by
Major General Funston that the pun- ?
Itive forces had reached that far to
the south. The speed with which the
advance force was being pushed Indicated
an average march of about
thirty miles a day.

General Gnvlra, the Carranza commander
at Juarez, had given notice t
that General Pershing's troops would 1
not be allowed to occupy Casas

It \vn^ declared by administration

being entirely a punitive expedition,
had none of the characteristics of an j
invasion and that there was no ob- ,
jcct in occupying towns or cities be- j
cause the American troops will keep c
constantly on the move, ' .
Officials said Saturday that the sit- t

the pursuit of Villa. J
