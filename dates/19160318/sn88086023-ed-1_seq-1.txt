STRAIN MAKES STATEMENT BEARING
SCHOOL
A very lengthy statement in relation
to the school controversy was submit
ted to the East oregonlan by C. P
Strain this afternoon. Owing to lack
of tpace the entire statement cannot
be given today. The following is the
introductory statement and the bal
ance of the communication will be
published Monday.
To the Kditor: The attack being
made upon the school board la bound
to Injure the schools If taken serious
ly. For the Information of the pub.
lie I will say that the selection of Mr.
Park was made after a great deal of
considerat on. From the time of Mr.
lenders retirement until the election
of Park the old members of the board
had the matter under consideration.
Dozens of applications were on file
and a number of personal visits were
made here by applicants. The salary
asked ranged up to ftlOO and the ap
plications came from cities up to the
s xe of Seattle and Portland. ther
having been a high school principal
from each .,f these two cities. The Se
attle man had formerly been superin
tendent of the VVenatchee schools.
When any person charge hasty ac
tion he draws entirely upon his im-
maglnatlon. To assi that th
board would decide so Important a
matter hastily is a grave reflection
Upon their f dellty to the people. 1
lesent the charge. The most cherish
ed of one's possessions is the confi
dence of his employer which In this
case is the people of Pendleton dist
rict. The charge that the board played
politics has not. and could not have
any foundation. All the board ex
cept myself were accused of removing
Mr. Landers in order to make a place
for Mr. Hampton. The board denied
the charge and. as I understand the
matter assured the lenders people
that Mr. Hampton was not to be el.
ected. But Mr. Landers' retirement
came so late that the elect'on of a
supnrintendent was deferred until this
ear. Judge Phelps. J. T Brown and
myself are all in public life. To sup
Pose that our action was inspired by
a hope of winning votes is to believe
us fools. Mr. Brown, for instance is

SUPERINTENDENT ISSUE
a candidate in the primaries for coro
ner. Mr. Hampton has a following
here who are so much devoted to him
that they may carry their resentment
to the polls. For It must be remem
bered that the position of teacher af
fords opportunity to make friendships
than which none are stronger.
It has been charged that the school
board, overwhelmed with a guiltv
conscience sneaked off behind closed
doors to elect Mr. Park The facts are
that the board had been requested to
do what ever could be done to spare
Mr. Hampton's professional life. By
holding a secret meeting we could
keep our decision out of the papi r-j
thus giving him further time to se
cure employment elsewhere. His
friends, not the board published thi
news.
The charge that the board consists i
of four ciphers and one significant i
figure insults the manhood of thej
board. As to myself. I was elected in I
June last year, after the election of
teachers. In a measure I was elected
as a protest to the action of the board
in removing Mr. Landers But sure
ly no one expected or desired that 1
hould rough house the board into j
changing their plans n order merely
to prve my Independence. No one.
has a right to assume that Judge
Phelps would weild his alleged hyp
notic power over the dupes associated
under him simply for sport.
In the life of all school men and'
Preachers there conies a time in the
community when a change is desired !
It is no reflection on the man OS I
community that th:s is so. I was at.
first Inclined to dispute the conclu-
sion of the board that such was true !
now as to Mr. Hampton. But what
Investigation, I was able to make eon- j
Mnced me that nothing was to be
gained for the district or Mr. Hanip.
ton by persisting further In this'
course.
Mr. Park .... The law provides :
no way to elect teachers except by j
the school board. The election of u-
perlntendent ha been made In this
way. Assaults upon the professional
reputation of those elected becomesj
an attack upon the most sacred inter-
ests of our social life.
I was an eight room school and the dis
trict was larger than the town.
Besides attending summer school
j at the University of Oregon. Mr. Park
i states he attended during one unlver
i sity year, taking a degree last spring.
He states he was entatlvely offered
several other schools wherein a salary
of 11801) per year was offered..
Mr Park is confident of making
good In Pendleton and asks to be
given a fair trial local people He
Is a man assurance and believes he
will have little difficulty in his newly
chosen position.
