The following letter from the
B'etjAitary to the governncr of Nev
ada, has been received and Is self ex
planatory: Carson City, Nevada,
I March 11, 1916.
"Hon. Lewis H. Beason,
Pioche, Nevada.
My dear Mr. Beason:
In the absence of Governor Boyle
I am taking the liberty of acknowledg
ing your letter of the ninth instant
relative to the itineiary of the Sil
ver service for the Battleship "Nev
ada". '
You will observe from the enclosed
itinerary which was adopted some
time ago that the Bervice will reach
l'iocha Saturday, March 18th at 9:30
A. M. and will leave Pioche Sunday
March 19th at 12:01 P. M. :
T lie service will be carried in the
private car Mizpah of the Tonopah
and Goldfi?ld railroad which will be
(he place of exhibition in each com
munity also. The idea of packing and
unpacking the set in each town, and
place had to be abandoned owing to
having it displayed in some promi
nent place to be abandoned owing to
to marring which would inevitably
take placn in this event The cat.
'will be "spotted" in the most con
venient place and the public vinited
to view the set as displayed in the
car.
Caliente. is included in the towns
of exhibition, but no, provisions was
'made for PanU,ea. You might take
th'i; matter upi with the local . rail
road people and s3e if they cannot ar
range, to make a longer stop att
Panaca than usual in order that
those interested could see the service.
This could be done going to and from
Pioche.
With kindest regards, I am,
Sincerely Yours,
C. D. SMITH,
Secretary to the Governor.
It is proposed to have, the trai
enroute from Pioche to Caliente to
morrow stop long enugh at Panacii
station for the residents of the high
school town to get a glimpse of the"
silver service. Arriving at Caliente,
the special car containing the service
will be open to tho public that even
,ne and until the departure of No.;
!J0 for Salt Lake and the northern
part of the state. After completing
the tour of the state, which will end
at Reno on the 29th inst, the service
will be forwarded to be placed on
the lmtUeshlD bearine the name of
the stiite. . i
P. is understood that the itin
erary will be under the direction of
E. O. Mc Ccrmick, vice-president of
the Southern Pacific railroad who
will be with the car at every point)
v'slted. ,'Will Epstein of Carson will
also be) along to keep the exhibit in
shape. Dougias White, industrial
figdat of the Salt Lake route, wilj
'be with the car while it is on thei
lines of his road. I
Every resident of this community
should take advantage of this rare op
portunity to see Nevada's gift to
the big Nevada ship cf Uncle Sam's.
JUDGE HORSEY IS NOT
READY FOR ANNOUNCEMEN1
Judge, Chas. Lee Horsey returned,
i.ast Sunday from a trip to ReneJ
'where he was in attendance at the
imetking of the Democratic) sta,tf
jjonimlte, and incidentally to ate1
tend to some, business matters and
jjeel the political pulse over on the,
other side of thd state.
In connection with the possibilities
of becoming a candidate for ' the
Democratic nomination, Judge Horsey
still withholds his announcement and
in ttfet, declares that he has noj
definitely decided, although he has
rrecelved much encouragement anc
) proffers of support torn men influen
tlal In his party. But In any event,
should he decide to enter the race,
i he will first step; down from the
.' bench, by handing his resignation
to Governopr Boyle, and then make
7 ftts announcement; for he does not
. wanitl it said that there has bee?
. raiding of the judiciary in, ' politics
in his case.
, The Judge will hold a term
30urt at Las Vegas beginning next)
week and after that, he will probably
know what his future course will be.
The possibility of Judge Horsey
Teslnaitioti has caused quite a lib
tie speculation a4 to who his succes-
T
oday
or might be. Of course ft would be
up to tiovemor uoyie to name a
man to fill the unexpired term, or
rather until the next election. Dis
tS',3t Attorney Oir is sure to ' b
considered and would, no doubt, have
many supporters in both counties. In
event of his appointment, there would
be a vacancy in the district attor
ney's effice and it would be then up.
to the county commissioners to make
a selection from the four attorneys;
in the county, viz. John M. Breeze,
Tom Osborne, Ernest Wadsworth
and) A. L. Scott, to serve out the
unexpired term.
