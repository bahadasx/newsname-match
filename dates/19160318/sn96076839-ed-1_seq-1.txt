SHOT AT RANDOM
Buck up, work up, and get there!
Yes, a lazy duffer is a man, but 'um!
Pigs is pigs, but some have only two
feet.
Just what is a politician? Darned if
we know!
"Food for the fishes" is overworked.
Let's have a new one.
Universal peace? Huh! One-half
the world is scrapping with each other,
and the rest are scrapping with their
wives.
Then, too, preparedness against the
vitriolic toneue of the gossip would be
a welcome deliverance to many a la
cerated soul.
In this great land of ours all men are
equal, but many are not willing to ad
mit it.
The president says the United States
is founded on its sense of humanity.
' 0. K., but it will require some mighty
big guns to maintain the foundation.
The angelic world is full of men who
extol their virtues, but few are ever
willing to admit that they are rotton to
the core.
The belligerants call each other liars
and the war correspondents intimate
that both sides are lyfng, and blamed if
we don't believe the whole dinged ca
poodle are just plain prevaricators.
The wise man listens when others
speak. The fool hears only himself.
But, then, when peace is restored the
war correspondents can find lucrative
employment in digging potatoes.
Even the wisest of men have their
silly moments when they propose.
And now the dudes are getting theirs
Owing to the war the cost of violet dye
has gone up to 112,000 a barrel.
We have our German-Americans
British-Americans, Swidish-Americans
and numerous other hyphenated Ameri

RURAL CREDIT TRICKSTERS
Farmers Warned to Be Cautious
in Dealing with Them.
The department has recently received
letters from a number of farmers who
have subscribed for stock in rural
credit companies, including so-called
cooperative companies which appear
to have no real cooperative features.
In some of these letters the complaint
is made that the agents selling the stock
make misrepresentations as to when
loans may be obtained by subscribers
and that the companies later disclaim
responsibility for the statements made
by the agents. In a number of instances
farmers seem to have gained the idea
from the agent that they would be able
to secure loans within a relatively short
time, and express disappointment on
realizing that they must wait for an
indefinite period for the pron ised loan
and go on making payments just the
same on the stock which they have
agreed to take.
Where farmers are confronted with a
proposition of this character, they
should first read the prospectus and
the contract very carefully and make
sure that they know exactly what these
mean, especially the contract. If the
contract is so worded that its meaning I
is not clear after a careful reading,
this in itself should be reason enough
for extra caution. The agents explana
tion of the contract is not a part of the
contract, nor is his promise that the
company will do things not specified
in the contract by any means sure to
be recognized by the company.
Farmers ought, first, to find out what
provision has been made for the pro
tection of the interests of subscribers,
either through responsible Government
supervision over the activities of the
company, or in any other way, and if
they are in doubt they should consult
competent advisors with regard to the
responsibility of the company before
paying over, or agreeing to pay over,
their own good money. Always, in the
matter of subscription to stock in any
kind of a company, they shouldjexercise
caution.
VERNE RICHARDS
GETS HONOR
The latter winners of the Alma Col
lege basket ball team of 1915-1G have
unaminously chosen Verne Richards of
East Jordan, as captain of the 1916-17
basket ball team.
The honor came to Richards as a big
surprise, he being only a Sophomore in
Alma college this year, and a Junior
next year, whereas it is customary to
elect a Junior, who will be a Senior the
following year. It shows just how
highly the East Jordan product stands
with his fellow athletes at Alma College.
Richards has played three positions on
the team this year and starred in each.
The new Alma College basket ball
captain will have every man back next
year, and the fact that Alma College
lost only one Michigan Intercollegiate
game, leads him to believe that he will
have a championship team in 1916-17.
ALCOHOL AND
PNEUMONIA
The United States Public Health Ser
vice brands strong arinK as tne most
efficient ally of pneumonia. It de
clares that alcohol is the handmaiden of
the disease which produces ten per
cent of the deaths in the United States.
This is no exaggeration. We have
known for a long time that indulgence
in alcoholic liquors lowers the indivi
dual vitality, and that the man who
drinks is peculiarly susceptible to
pneumonia. The United States Public
Health Service is a conservative body.
It does not engage in alarmist propa
ganda. In following out the line of its
official duties it has brought forcefully
to the general public a fact which will
bear endless repetition. The liberal
and continuous user of alcoholic drinks
will do well to heed this warning,
particularly at this season of the year
when the gruesome death toll from
pneumonia is being doubled.

Our Board o Trade
Ready for Business
Officers Elected Thursday Evening at Meeting
of Our Business Men.
The meeting of our business men to reorganize the East
Jordan Board of Trade was held at the Armory Thursday evening.
About fifty of our business men were present, which is conclusive
evidence that there is a live interest at this time in further develop
ment of our town. .
- Vice-president A. E. Cross presided and Secretary R. A.
Brintnall read a report of the previous work of the Board. Following
this report came the election of Officers and Directors, which result
ed as follows:
President CARL STROEBEL
Vice President JAMES GIDLEY
DIRECTORS
w A. CAMERON W. P. PORTER
DR. H. W. DICKEN W. J. ELLSON
G. A. BELL A. E. CROSS
B. E. WATERMAN II. I. McMILLAN
A meeting of the Board of Directors will be held in the near
future, at which time secretary and treasurer will be selected, and
committees appointed.
Our citizens are a unit in the belief that the time is ripe for
making some future steps in the way of developing our city and the
surrounding country. And, to use a homely expression, "The time
to set the hen is when the hen is ready." The officers and directors
selected are capable men, and once organized for work, we feel
confident that they will find our business men ready and willing
to co-operate in any movement toward development that may be
projected.
LOOKING FORWARD
There is a tendency on the part of
some writers to belittle the importance
of economic questions in the coming
presidential campaign, and to empha
size the importance of foreign policies
as a campaign issue. It is probably
true that the foreign relations of this'
Government will be in the spotlight for
many months to come, but unless the
voters of this country are afflicted with
economic astigmatism they will weigh
carefully the questions of our future
trade and industry before casting their
ballot. Humanity is still in the bread
and butter stage.
There are two factors of prime im
portance in the consideration of these
very practical questions: First, the
plans now being perfected abroad for
trade combinations; and, second, the
fact that our greatest trade rivaj, Ger
many, will emerge from the European
struggle industrially unscathed, and
with an army of men clamoring for
work at any wage. '
England has jettisoned her free trade
policy. During the middle of the 19th
Century, when her mechanical inven
tions had made it possible to control
any market which would give free ac
cess to her wares, it became highly
important that she operate under a free
trade policy a condition precedent to
inducing other countries to do likewise.
The so-called school of Manchester, of
which Cobden was the chief exponent,
inaugurated a free trade propaganda
which very nearly, but not quite con
vinced Germany that open ports spell
ed sound economics, and which quite
thoroughly convinced a large number
of people in this country that free trade
was the proper thing.
That was during the period when the
South was a purely agricultural section.
The adherence of the South to this free
trade conviction has lessened in an in
verse ratio as the development of agri
cultural industries has progressed in
Dixie. At that time the South sold a
large share of her products to England,
where they were made up and came
back to us in the form of finished
materials. It is a true statement that
in many cases the agricultural indus
tries of the South were utilized by
Great Britain to break dyown the manu
facturing industries of the North.
Whenever for instance, an attempt was
made to build up our cotton textile inH
dustrics, Encland, with cotton goods
manufactured from Southern raw
material, would drive our cotton manu
facturers into bankruptcy by dumping
1 l.-l-l IJ!.
ner goous on our marKei ai prices naic
ulously low. That is one of the reasons
why the protective policy took firm
root in the North. But England fears
German competition after the war. She
was experiencing it prior to the war.
Today her return to the protective
policy needs but the affirmative action
of Parliament. The country is well
nigh unanimously. agreed on protection.
Every studenf of trade who has re
turned from Germany during the past
year declrres that the cessation of war
will find Germany stripped to the loins
and ready for the biggest commercial
campaign ever staged on this planet.
And Austria is going to do teamwork
with Germany. The two nations are
perfecting trade combinations, and the
Governments themselves will enter in
to active partnership in all industries.
State socialism is the plan.
And little Japan is sawing wood. Her
wage scale is one-twelfth that of this
country, and her industries are being
imperialized. The end of the war will
find Japan the mistress of the Pacific
while we are still growling about the
seamen's act.
In the face of all these considerations
what reasonable voter will fail to give
heed to future economic policies?
What sensible man will cast his vote
for a near-free-trade, vacillating, theor
izing, impractical Democracy? We
must ship men of affairs on our next
voaage, and they will be found in the
Republican party.
GETTING YOUR MONEY
OUT OF THE BANK

ice to the community than to protect its
valuables it would render a useful one;

fits too often lost sight of in the busy
whirl of business.
We take many things for granted and
live in a matter-or-ract age. We want
our morning paper at the breakfast
table with never a delay and with little
thought of what it costs to collect,
transmit, type, print and deliver the
news. We want our tram on the dot
or we get impatient. We want our
milk and our coal, blizzard or no bliz
zard. We likewise expect the bank to
do our business smoothlv. efficiently.
and without thought of the cost or the
risks attending.
When your bank hands you a check
book, it gives you license to draw as
many checks, in as large or small sums
as you wish, with the only provision
(except in certain cases where a
minimum balance is required) that you
do not overdraw, and promises to
honor your checks as presented as long
as your balance is sufficient to pay
them.
Whether you want to pay your credi
tor in the next block, or a thousand
miles away, the checking privilege of
a bank account permits you to make
your yayment with ease, safety and
despatch.
When you mail your check your
trouble is over and the banks has just
begun, for the bank warrants to you
three things, all for your own protec
tion and at its own risk. ' It is well to
know them.
It guarantees (a) That it will pay
only the checks you have signed. If
your name is forged and the bank pays
the check, it cannot charge the amount
to your account; (b) That it will pay
only in the sum originally drawn. If
some one gets your check and raises
the amount, making it apparently a
genuine check, the bank can only
charge the amount in which you origin
ally drew the check, unless it can show
you were grossly careless in' so draw
ing that you invited fraud. Therefore
be careful to draw your checks proper
ly; (c) To pay to the party to whom
you ordered the amount paid and none
other. If the check gets into the hands
of strangers who forge the indorsement
so that the party to whom you ordered
the money paid does not get it, the
payment is at its risk, and you are
harmless.
All this is ultimately for your good as
a depositor. You know that your ac
count cannot be drawn against except
on your order. You know that the
party you want to receive payments
gets it. You get back the most perfect
voucher known to the business world.
Many a dispute has been settled and
loss and law suit avoided by producing
bank vouchers that told in no uncertain
way that payment had been made ac
cording to the intent of the drawer.
Therefore for your own good you
ought to keep your money in a bank,
and draw it out by check.
THE CITIZENS AND
THE SCHOOL
No matter how exalted or humble a
person may be, mere is one sacred
duty which he owes to humanity and
which it is imperatively incumbent
on him to pay. . That duty is the pro
tection and the fostering of our public
school system.
We are living in the age of education
and advancing intellectual development
and the human mind that is deprived
of the best advantages obtainable will
be hampered and hindered at every
step in life.
It matters not how bright nor how
acute the infantile mind may be, if
that mind is denied the advantages of
education then the child grown to ma
turity will be retarded and humiliated
because of its intellectual deficiencies.
It will be a living monument to the
neglect and the indifference of its
parents. It will be a mark of shame
and a blight upon the - community that
reared it in its ignorance. It will be
an object of pity where it should be
one of pride.
Eaucation and the advantages of
intellectual advancement have made
America a great country. And America
is even yet in its infancy.
Our school system should be encour
aged and raised to the highest point of
efficiency. The instructors should be
upheld and given to understand that
they have the backing of a united com
munity, and that the community ex
pects satisfactory results.
If our present buildings are inade
quate and new ones are needed, then
for the sake of enlightened humanity
let us spend the money and get them.
Let us make any other improvements
or new departures that the welfare of
our children require.
We have brougnt these children into
the world, and in their infancy and
youth they are helpless. It is our duty
to give them an education that will en
able them to successfully cope with the
intricate problems of existence that
will confront them later in life. To
do less would be to neglect a sacred
duty, to shame the innocent ones for
whose very existence we are responsi
ble.
Let us keep our schools and our chil
dren in mind. Let us study their wel
fare individually and collectively. Let
us leave no stone unturned that will
advance their moral and materia
interests.
For the man who honors his off
spring ts honored of men. t
Rather than waste kindness on
ungrateful man, lavish it on a dog.
an
As a matter of fact there's very little
common sense in the worldmost of it
i is uncommon.
A man is always eating something he
shouldn't and a woman is always say
ing something she shouldn't.
This is the season of the year when
a man looks In his backyard and de
cides the one thing needful is a goat
that will consume old tin cans.
Many an excellent man is discour
aged by the thought that the world wil
have to wait until after he is dead be
fore it finds out how good he was.

nave any iaea wnat standard to work
up to, both teachers and pupils are to
be commended.
