Everybody, Pull Fop That $2,000,000 Fop Bremerton
There are four or five perfectly good reasons
why Tacoma ought to take a hand in helping
Bremerton land that $2,065,000 appropriation
for transforming the Puget Sound navy yard
into a ship-building base of the first magnitude.
There is the selfish reason. Anything which is
going to make Bremerton, 15 miles away, ex
pand and advance is going to have a mighty
beneficial effect on Tacoma.
But there are better reasons than that.
The Bremerton improvement is a fine, large
step in the direction of national preparedness.
It is a step in a wav that peculiarly benefits
the Pacific coast. And it is a step in a way that,
The Times has maintained from the first, is the
best way for the whole United States. For it
would mean that Uncle Sam was going to build
more of his own warships. And that would pull
the claws of militarism by taking the profit! out
of preparing against war.

Harvest Soon
Found-Famine
By Jack Jungmeyer

ugly bul swect-l'lcshcd hali
but, from some mysterious
deeps of tbe sea.
And, hungry as the halibut,
follow the horde of fisher
men, up alun^ Ihe British
Columbia and Alaskan coast,
taking their toll.
Thus It has gone, genera-
Hon after generation.
Hut now the men are harvest
ing the ocean faster than the hal
ibut breed, and unless new hanks
are found hy the government on
the west eaaat there will be v fish
famine, say the trawlers.
The haul last year was IB per
cent greater than In 1914 — U.">,
--000,000 pounds.
Hul It took a longer lime and
more persistent search to find the
big, succulent flounders.
"The public," says Capt. John
Carroll, halibut trawler of 1.3
years' experience on both coasts,
"has ■ vague belief that edible
fish are Inexhaustible. Not so.
Hupply Is llccreasing
"The halibut on the known
banks of the north Pacific are
not breeding as fast as they're
caught, eveu though every fish is
taken by a hook.
"The government has made
some attempt to locate new
grounds. The Albatross was out
for that purpose In 1914 and
1915, but without very satisfac
tory results. I was a member of
her crew myself, but these expe
ditions lack the right kind of
manning. - *
"The present grounds, though
now supplying &,". per cent of all
halibut consumed in Ibis country,
are pretty near fished out, and
unless prolific new grounds ;.re
located soon the I'nited States
may expect a fish famine inside
of 10 years.
"And there's another angle to
this, linking up importantly with
the country's preparedness pro
gram.
Great Xaval ltcserve
"The 4000 halibut fishermen
on tlie Pacific, to say nothing of
Hie cod men, form the finest kind
of a reserye for the navy if trou
ble should ever occur. All big
strapping, trained men of the sea.
"BUT TO KMP 'EM ON THE
SEA, THEBES HOT TO BE
FISH, AND TO II WE ENOUGH
HALIBUT TO UPHOLD THE IN.
DI'STUY, NEW BANKS WII I,
HAVE TO BE LOCATED ON THE
PACIFIC.
"That's one reason why Uncle
Sam should concern himself
about tho service he ran and
ought to perform for these trawl
ers."
The appropriation is one that does not savor
in any sense of pork. Practically every expert
who has investigated the Sound navy yard has
pronounced it ideal for the purpose to which it is
now proposed to he put.
Senator Poindexter's bill passed the senate
Thursday, as our Washington dispatches indi
cated, and now the measure is up to the house.
The Times suggests that the Tacoma Commer
cial club become active in urging every Wash
ington congressman to vote for and work for this
bill. Incidentally it might be a good plan to sug
gest to some of them at the same time that they
withdraw and forget certain other apporpriation
bills of their authorship which do belong in the
pork barrel.
And The Times would suggest also that every
Taconian write those congressmen, impressing
on them the importance of their pressing the
Poindexter bill.

Just by way of making more concrete what the
«S2,O6r),(XK) would do, we had a reporter go to
Bremerton and investigate what was proposed.
He found that three thousand of the highest
type of skilled mechanics will be added to the
•present staff of 1,400 if the yard takes up battle
ahip construction.
The annual payroll, aside from the thousands
of dollars paid to enlisted navy men there, was
$1,350,000 during 1915.
It would be more than doubled under the new
era.
To trans, urn the Puget Sound navy yard for
battleship construction, about $800,000 must be
spent for building ways M 0 feet long.
Cantilever cranes and a massive ovcrlu.id
traction system will cost $250,000.
All this construction would be done, probably,
within the six months following the passage of
the bill. The rest of the appropriation it is pro
ought to be."

large the present facilities.
It is understood that a battle cruiser, which
would take three years to build, would be tbe
first job for the Puget Sound yard. Materials
for its const ruction would begin to arrive at
Bremerton by the first of January, 1017, if the
appropriation program goes through.
Repair work that will keep 1,400 mechanics
busy for two years has been assigned to the yard.
It |a estimated that Bremerton, Charleston,
ifanette ami Port Orchard eventually will be in
corporated into one city of a joint population of
from 80,000 to 30,000.
THE PUGET SOUND NAVY YARD WILL
THEN BE ONE OF TACOMA'S GREATEST
POTENTIAL SOURCES OF BUSINESS.
And it will be a government ship-manufactur
ing plant of which every American will be proud!
