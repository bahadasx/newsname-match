co-operative committee repre

recent startling revelations of

a chain of hotels are being oper

findings of the committee.
So much for an investigation by

blowing upor the Main in Havana
harbor. Spain was accused of
having done it. But Spain denied
that she had anything to do with
it, and nobody familiar with the
facts believes that Spain had any
thing to do with it. It was the
worst thing that could have hnp

The facts were not allowed to
reach the public. There Is every
ienson to believe that the Maine
was blown up by the intervention
ists, just as they are now believed
to be behind Villa's outlawry.
Let's examine the events of last
week. At the beginning of the
week there was no secretary of
war. Garrison had resigned.
We weietold that our relations
with Germany had reached the
breaking point and that President
Wilson was about to get us In
trouble with the Kaiser.
Champ Clark, Bill Stone and oth
er political fakers made a big
noise about goinx to muzzle the
president.
The president called their hand
and demand an expression from
congress an approval r disap
proval of his course.
A resolution was Introduced to
muzzle Mr. Wilson and the His
means that congrcs dodged the
question, The spineless h. i ocrltes
refused to go on record
That was a victory for the
president and gave him a free
hand. Then he reversed himself
on his submarine policy .ui'l nil
was quiet
Then we hear of the nppoin -trout
of a fellow named Baker, of
Cleveland, Ohio, as war secretary
The kept press told us he was one
of those "peace"ati uels

Colorado, two years
the kept press told
nothing about, and lie
little it did tell
However, the new war secreta
ry nnd man of peace had hardl.v
wanned his sent until the presi
dent ordered our troops to Invade
Mexico and get Villa, In the press
dispatch from Washington an
nouncing it I find this:
"Secretary of War Baker laid
before the President tonight a
detailed statement of the availa
ble military strength, He adv ised
the President that the War Col
lege of the General Staff had pre
pared a plan of campaign, not
only for the expedition against
Villa, but for a general Invasion
of Mexico .following a formal de
claration of war."
So you see. it is not exactly Villa
they are after, but "a general
invasion of Mexico." What for'?
One must read between the lines
to net at the bottom of what Is
going on. Here is another para
graph from the same dispatch)
"President Wiis m. in his official
statement, described the effort to
capture Villa as a "friendly net"
to aid President Carta m.a.
WHOSE CO-OPERATION is UN
ASKED." What do you know about that?
President Wilson has recognised
the Caranza government of Mexi
co iet, without asking or con
sulting Carrania, he orders his
army into Mexico nnd calls it a
'friendly act." according to the
dispatch. Could false pretenses go
farther? And ninety lier cent of
the American people swallow such
bunk without thinking.
Let me make a prediction : We
are going to do in Mexico just as
we did in the Phillippincs. Unless
a halt is called by an aroused
people, we are going to rob those
patriotic Mexicans of the liberty
they have so dearly bought, and
put them back under the heel of
"the church" and the Plunderbund
behind it just as we did in the
Phillipplnes and Cuba.
Later press dispatches announce
that the president has asked the
co-operation of Carranza, and
that Carranza has offered his as
sistance in capturing Villa. If this
be true and you can't tell then
we may do as we 'did in the Phll
lippine, where we fought with the
natives against Spain, and then
