Large Force.
EIGHTH OF MILLION IS ENOUGH
WASHINGTON. March 1 7. WMle
the house was debating the army bill
today the final draft of the senate
r.rmy bill was favorably reported by
Chairman Chamberlain.
Senator McCumber, republican, ot
North Dakota, made a speech urg
ing the country not to be swayed
from a middle course between war
hysteria and utter defenselessness.
He contended the United States was
In less danger of attack than ever
before.
"Congress, In Its growing servil
Ity,", he said, "has allowed Its func
tion to be usurped by the executive
until it has become the tool to con
vert presidential programs Into law.
Congress shou'd be the Judge of Vie
necessity and of the propriety of
changing our historical attitude."
Senator Hitchcock, democrat, auomltted
a minority report of his own.
"I do not feel Justified In Joining my
colleagues on the recommendation that
the standing army be Increased 78 per
cent," Mr. Hitchcock stated, "even
though that Increase he distributed over
five years. . In my opinion the increase
is about twice as much as It should be.
It would give us an army of 2ou,000 men
when enlisted to full strength."
An effort to pass a bill practically
doubling the number of cadets at the
military academy of West Point was
blocked by Senator Jones, republican,

At the next meeting of tha Omaha
Clearing House association, which Is
to he held in about a week, the mat
ter of the need of a new union depot
In Omaha Is to he taken up.
The Retail Grocers' association la
clso to take the matter up at the
next meeting.
Letters from these two organiza
t'ons reached tha special committee
of the Associated Retailers of Omaha
yesterday. Tbro are the result of a
number of letters sent to the various
business organizations of the city by
the special depot committee of the
Associated Retailers asking that the
various bodies appoint - committees
to co-opcrau with the retailers In
tbe demand for a new depot.
With the Builders' exchange already In
lino with a committee ready to work with
the retailers; ..with the Real Estste ex
change preparing to discuss the matter
at an early meeting; and with the Com
merclarclub handling the matter through
Its publlo affalra committee; the two new
promises by the bankers and the grocers
to take hold of the matter., are looked
upon as Indicating the Constantly increas

Here are some -recent 'opinion ex
pressed on the streets:
George T. Morton. Chairman of the City
Planning Board Omaha wanta tho best
depot and terminal facllltina obtainable
and warranted by the present business
and certain growth. F.asy communication
and close touch with the surrounding
territory is a fundamental requirement
for any city and especially for Omaha,
the "market town." Our whole railroad
terminal systems must be studied and a
plan worked out on scientific lines by
ablo engineers for the city and co-operation
with the railroads before we can
tell what things need to be done first,
and where; Ornate depot . building, are,
not the most Important nor the first fea
ture of the problem! The simplest 'method
of facilitating travel should he our aim,
Agitation for improved facilities ia-Umely.
Let us tnak plan' for- present "edt

- Tint to Start Something;.
J. W, -Gamble, President of the Stand
ard Chemical Company I'd like to sea a
new union depot, of course, but I suppose
If I should advocate it I would again be
criticised as I have been in the past.
When I was working hard with the Mis
souri river, navigation committee getting
river transportation started here, certain
persons criticised me,- and aaid that If
we would cut out- the navigation talk
and give the railroads some united sup
port, we .might stand a chance of getting
a union depot sometime. ' "
Benefit r KsperleneV.
M. J. Oreevy, Pioneer, Publicist; and
Politician We are going to have a new
union depot. That much is oertaln. The
vital feature seems to be the location.
Thirty years ago I urged a site between
Seventeenth and Twentieth streets, fac
ing north on Harney street, and i. believe
today this same-sK would be ideal. It
may be that Leavenworth street would
be just as desirable. The depot should be
close to the center of the city This
would -necessitate underground tracks
Into the terminal. It is a matter whlor
will call for some serious thinking. The
new depot's!!" should he-selected with I
a view of the city's growth for many
years hence. We should benefit by the
experience of other cities In matters of
this kind. ,

MANY DISQUIETING STORIES
EL PASO, Tex., March 17. Rap
Idly . growing .. uneasiness among
Americana throughout Mexico, espe
cially In the north and west, was evi
denced today by reports from various
sections- that United States citisens
were either on their way to the bor
der or were preparing to leave. .
At practically every point of en
tr along tbe northern and north
western frontier Americans arrived
today from tbe Interior,' but In the
majority of Instances they said they
were leaving Mexico as a matter ot
precaution and not because' of' any
oert acts of hostility ' against; them
. JThe vKteot aignifieant report -wag - re
cerved from Durango, where tho AmN
lean , vlc cohsttt advised that his wife
and child bo sent out of the' country.
This followed closely on the arrival Jast
night on the bordor of - the American
consul from Torreon with a large num
ber of Americana '
Americana ' arriving here brought nu
merous disquieting stories about the at
titude of the Mexicans In the Interior,
especially In Chihuahua,. Duranao and
Coahulla,. but invariably they told these
stories privately, and when asked o
make' any' statement for publication in
sisted that everything was quiet In the
section from, which they came. They en
plained the contradiction by saying that
they expected to return to Mexico when
things before more settled and they did
not wlah to say anything which might
arouse resentment of the Mexicans. An
American who arrived today from the
city of Chihuahua reported that all was
quiet there yesterday.
The Mexican consulate here received
a telegram today from . General Calles,
military governor of Aonora. saying that
a Vllllata spy, R. ranobllos, had been
arrested at Dos Cabesas. It Is alleged
that thla man was In Columbus on the
night of the raid. When questioned ha
aaid that Villa had fled after the raid
to Corralltoa, where he murdered ov
ers! cowboy and seized a number of
horses. He then started for Ualeana by
way of Puerto C'hoco.
Reports Increased '

slan front la reported In the official Aus
trian communication of yesterday, as re

"FLYING" COLUMN

mand of Colonel Dodd Said to
Be Advancing; at a
' Rapid Rate.
MAIN ARMY MOVES SLOWER
Two Wings Probably Will Form a
. Junction Somewhere Near
C.uai Grandci.
MAY HAVE STARTED EARLIER
KL PASO, Tex.. March 17. A few
definite farts about ths American ex
l edition Into Mexico today stood out
with considerable clearness, as the
result of official published reports
end the new brought here by Ameri
can who have been In touch with
some portion of thn American move
ment .
It seemed certain that of the two
columns which are "somewhere 'n
Mexico, " one was constituted for
speed, while the other apparently
as moving more slowly. The gwift
footed column was the auxiliary
aimy, seemingly mostly cavalry,
which went into Mexico fifty mllea
west of the main army of General J.
J. rershlng- when his forces crossed
at Columbus, N. M.
The secrecy which haa surrounded the
movements of the main column haa been
slight compared with the record of this
weatern force. There Is reason to believe,
from the official announcements, that the
western column may have gone Into
Mexico earlier than the main body. Every
report arriving here from the border as
serts that the western wing has traveled
the farther. By these same reports, the
t'vo columns will form a Junction near
the threatened American Mormon col
onies, possibly ' In . the . Csss Orsndes
region.
Swfplnar He port a lnverlf leg.
Reports that anlper had shot at the
troops remained unverified today. How
ever, sniping and even the possible kill
ing or wounding of a few American sol
dier by thess long rsnge msrksmen was
not regarded here as an indication that
the American army's .march up to date
was otherwise than a peaceful expedition,
so' far as the majority-of the Mexican
people are concerned.
Sniping hag been oommott on the Amer
ican side In this section, with the dif
ference that- on thn American side tha
sharpshooter - rmve had -only, com ftara
Uvely small targets to shoot at, such as
a horseman, an automobile, or at host, a
railroad train. There I nothing to pre
vent Individual of this typo, acting en
tirely on their own Initiative, from creep
ing onto some hill and sending a few
bullet at a distant column of troops'.
Problem' of Oeapatloa of Clttee.
Carranta officials, It was learned today,
have been discussing with some concern
whether American troops during the Villa
pursuit' would have to occupy any. Maxl
ran cities snd the effect of such occupa
tion upon Mexican public aentlment. .The
Carransa officer havo frankly expreaaed
the hope that the . garrisoning of the
cities can be , left to their own troops.
The American army' choice of tha Chi
huahua deaert as It placa of entry pre
clude for the present such a problem
a city gsrrisnn duty. It Is estimated
her that the coat of the Villa pursuit
at present la upward of 140,000 per day.
There Is one soldier in the Carransa
gsrrisnn In Juare who I frankly antl
Carransa. He la a 13-year-old boy who
was captured with the Villa garrison at
Juares and whose life was spared on the
condition that he turn Carranslsta. HI
name ho ssld today firmerly was "Little
Pancho Villa."
"And now," he added, "It I Little Car

"Whom do you like bestf he

NEW CITY RISES AT COLUMBUS
COU-MUT8, N. M., March 1".
(Fly Messenger to Kl Paso.) Two
half squadrons of cavalry left tho
expeditionary main base here today,
striking in a westerly direction.
Whether they were Intended to re
inforce the punitive columns was
not known. One report Indicated
that they were going, out to help
protect the line of communications
of that portion of the expedition
under Colonel Dodd, which three
daya ago circled to the westward
fifty miles from here and entered
Mexico about the- same time with
the main column which went di
rectly south from here.
Troop trains over night swelled
the Columbus ram to what la said to
be nearly the slxe of the original ex
pedition. Heavy construction work
of many varieties was under way to
night and a new city was rising with
almost visible progress to become a
largo permanent base.
Marr Is Qalet. (
The report that several men on outpost
duty with the expedition had been
wounded by snipers ha not been con
firmed here. It la significant that the
soldiers about csnip who come Into com
munication with returning relays of
transport ; drlvere receive information
which lead them to believe the ma sen
haa been quiet thus far.
Kxcept for this occasions! gossip and
the secret dispatches coming over the
aire the men of the expedition out some
where in northern Chihuahua are com
pletely out of communication of any sort
with oven their comrsde at thla bsse.
Tho body of First Lieutenant Kdward
M. Zell of the Eleventh cavalry, who
killed himself here yesterday, wae today
sent to Italtlmore for burial. One of tha
chaplains, who wss on Intimate terms
with Zell, said thst ha had worried for
fear his troop wss not up to standard In
discipline. IJeutensnt Zell' troop waa
said by brother officers to be among the
best.
When Lteutensnt Zell alighted from a
troop train In , Columbus and hsd gased
for a moment over the gray, desert-Ilka
wastes about town, he xclalmed, "Great
Ood! I this Columbus, New Mexico?"
