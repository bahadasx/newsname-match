El Paso, Tex. March 18. American
troops were to reach Casas Graudes at
midnight last night, Gen Gabriel Gav
Ira announced at Juarez, late yester.
dayi Casas Grandes is a little more
than 60 miles from the point where
Col. George A. Dodd's columns entered
Mexico, so the Americans have- been
moving more than 30 miles a day, '
i Calculation at army head-quarters
In San Antonio, Tex., yesterday indi
cated that Gen Pershing soon will be
in a positlou to redivide his forces
and, from near the heart of the re
gion where Villa has been operating,
begin a systoaiatic search for the
Mexican bandit. Official reports to
Gen Funstou gave assurances that
there had been no clash between
Americans and Mexicans.
Gen Gavira announced that he had
a telegram that a courier from the
Americans already had reach-ju Casa3
Grandes, announcing that the United
States troops might be expected at
midnight The general said he had
wired Lieut-Col. Refugio S. Davilo, in
command of the constitutionalist gar
rison at Casas Grandes, not lo permit
the Americans to occupy that city.
Jiis instructions from Gen Carranaa,
Gou Gavira said, did not give him
authority to let American troops oc
cupy a city. It would be contrary to
Gen .Carranza'a orders, he 3aid,
. It was estimated that Cpl. Dodd, who
crossed the ; international boundary
line at 1 o'clock Thursday morning, 45
miles from Hachita, N. M., last night
was ciose by, if not actualiy in touch
with the heavier and slower ' column
led in Wednesday . by,. Gen 'Pershing.
It was intended that the more rt)6l;iie
force of Col. Dodd should' ,:efietl'a
Juncture'with the first column," after
which Col. Dodd s cavalry would 1 oe'
sent' on reconnaissance, utilizing also
the services of American cowboys Who
have joined the column together y itb
other scouts. : ' . . :; ' ';' ;
Failure of any body of Mexicans to
oppose the Americans and reports that
Gen'. Calles was using his men to for
tify the passes which Jead from the
state of Chihuahua into the state of
Sonora, served to dispel somewhat
the. feeling common in many quarters
that not all the Carranza garrisons
would co-operate in the chase of Villa.
It was pointed out, however, that the
country through which the troops are
now moving is so desolate aud almost
uninhabited that attack either. by Vil
la or by Insubordinate government
troops would, occasin no, surprise.
For no reason ascertainable there
prevails a belief that . an encounter
with Villa is not probable for some
days. His exact whereabouts is not
known, but he is believed by most per
sons to be in the mountains, not far
from the Casas "' Grandes " district
toward which the Americans are
moving and against which the Carran
za columns are said to v bd directed
from other directions.
SITUATION IN IRELAND
Campaign Against Enlistment Makes
-Trouble. '-'
- London, March 16. The Post . pub
lishes a long article in regard to what
it characterizes as the serious' situa
tion in Ireland on account of activity
on the part of the Sinn Fein society.
It says:
. "From motives of patriotism English
newspapers hitherto have refrained
from commenting on the situation in
Ireland, but it is developing with such
rapidity and gravity that silence is no
longer possible.
"Through the south and west a vlg:
orous organized campaign against re
cruiting is being carried out without
sericqs hindrance. Within a few
weeks several persons have been in
dicted and tried in Dublin, but in every
case, acquitted by the Jury amid tu
multuous applause from those, in the
court room. All these trials took place
before ordinary Juries and we await
with impatience the time when the au
thorities will utilize their powers to
have such cases tried beforo special
Juries or military tribunnls.
"In Cork a committee recently ap
poltned to organize St. Patrick's day
Celebration was offered the use of sev
eral companies of Irish soldiers; hut
the committee refusod to allow them
to participate stating in reply:
" 'The British army is in hostile oc
cupation of Ireland and it would be as
absurd for Belgians to invite a contin
gent from the German army to partici
pate in a Belgian national celebra
tion.' "

INDIA IN THE WAR
v-t Other Nation Has a Problem Like
S'rngland s Except Austria.
Aus.? iB nt send the soldiers
recruited ? jT Italian provinces
to fight again?. 7-'talians, observes
the Cleveland Pla Thaler. She doe3
not compel her Serb regiments from
Bosnia and Herzegovlan to tight
against Serbians. The "Little Rus
sians" of Galicia are not, - as a rule,
sent against the Russians. And , the
Roumanian frontier is not' being
guarded by the Hungarian Roumaus
of Siebenburgen. There is an eitort
to dispose the polyglot army of the
dual empire so that the soldiers will
uot be compelled to light against men
of their own race.
No other belligerent has bo difficult
a rac e problem. But England, mistress
of the great Mohammedan armies of
uilia, has a somewhat similar problem
and is solving it in an entirely differ
ent way.
At the beginning of the war the In
dians were brought to France and did
excellent service. In spite or their
unfamiliarity with European climate,
they served throughout the first win
ter in the Flemish trenches. But with
the approach of a second winter the
British sent thein all away. They
were solemnly thanked for their deeds
of valor, and packed off to some other
front where they would not havo to
light the weather as well as the
enemy.
, All these men are now either fight
ing against the Ottomans or are on
garrison duty ready to fight the Otto
mans whenever it may be necessary.
Some arc in Mesopotamia, others are
in Egypt. The Australian and New
Zealand troops, established in Egypt
early in the war, were removed for the
Dardanelles campaign, and after the
Urltibh defeat were sent to Saloniki.
The safety of Egypt is almost wholb
entrusted to the Indians, while upon
the valor of Indians depends the final
success or failure of the Mesopotamia
war.
It will he seen therefore, that the In
dians are now almost wholly placed
where they will be opposed by a Mo
hammedan foe. The majority of the
Indian soldiers are themselves Moham
medans, either orthodox or heterodox,
though there are large non-Moslem
elements. There has been no slight
est hesitancy, either at the Dardanel
les or in Mesopotamia, in throwing
these soldiers against the armies o:
the Turkislr sultan, supreme head of
Islam, nor has there been any indlca
tion of lack of zest among .the. Indian
troops. '
Colore the war the Indian army
numbered nearly. 330.0OO men. Mo?,
many of these are actually participat
ing in the European war cannot he es
timated. , .It Is, certain,.. however, that
the men formerly in actual British ser
vice do not account for the entire num
ber'of Iilfliun-' trofips'' os ' there' -have
been many small contingent's sent by
independent Indian princes.',, Germany
complained, bitterly at; the , beginning
of the war boqause these non-Christiar
soldiers were; brought to light against
Christians, in Europe,, ; No longer,), has
she any complaint on this score, as the
Indians are now opposing . Germany'!
own non-Christian ally.
Not only have the Indians proved
faithful and efficient in the war, but
et home there has been a complete
absence of agitation against British
rule. Considering the unrest and dis
content which existed prior to the wai
this is remarkable. On the whole In
dia has done so well by Britain that
when the war is over she may demand
with assurance that larger measure of
respect and honor which is the dream
cf intelligent and educated Indians oi
all creeds and tongues,

PRAISE FOR NORWICH
Record of. Vermont Institution Men
tioned by Veteran Officer.
General E. V Nichols, the veteran
superintendent cf the Virginia Military
institute, in a recent address delivered
before the National Security League
Congress in Washington, took occasion
to praise highly one of Vermont s old
est institutions. Not only did he take
occasion to praise it, but in his able
paper on the subject of Military Train
ing in Schools, the Vermont institu
tion was the first one to be mentioned.
The following is an extract from Gen.
Nichol's paper:
The American Scientific and Mili
tary academy, the forerunner of Nor
wich university which was incorpor
ated in 1834, was founded by Captain
Alden Partridge, a West Point gradu
ate, in 1819. Its military and aca
demic activities have extended, there
fore, throughout nearly a century of
time. Under Captain Partridge the
development of the system of instruc
tion peculiar at that time to the United
States Military academy of which he
was, not only a gruduato but for many
years a professor and later a superin
tendent, was continuous and progress
ive. Its patronage -was confined In
large measure to tho New England
section; and yet its graduates became
in timo widely scattered and served
as picneers in the development of
foundations similar to that of their
alma mater.
"in our various wars tho record of
Norwich university men and through
them the record ot the institution that
fostered and trained them has been
most praiseworthy.
"In the Black Hawk war nine eleves
of this Institution served as officers;
in the Seminole war 17; ir. the Mexi
can war 50. In the Civil war the
fratricidal strife of '61 '65 the ser
vices of the eleves and graduates of
Norwich university- were peculiarly
distinguished. For the federal' land
forces It furnished 504 officers; for the
Confederate forces, 34. For the fed
eral navy, 85 officers; for the Confed
erate naVy, three officers and' two en
gineers; a total for the armies and
navies of the contending forces of C28
officers. ( Of thiB number nine served
as major-generals, ,32,, as brigadier ,
generals. 70 as colonels, 31 as lieutenant-colonels,
IS6 as majors, 155 as cap
tains, 70 as first lieutenants, and 36 as
second lieutenants. This Is ' indeed
an honorable record. But, perhaps the
greatest service of this institution .
during the Civil war was that rendered (
by its elejres in drilling and reducing i
to- discipline the hosts of recruits
placed under their instruction. .VII;
praise then to this noble institution .
and to the services it has rendered to
our now happily ire-united country... It;
has weathered many a storm in; its '
long history and is prepared to render ',
under its present management a con-1
Uuued, If not a greater service, to the
nation." .

Holland Deeply Stirred by Loss of

PRESS BITTER AGAINST GERMANY
Intimations That Kaiser's Government
May Find Itself In Conflict with
Neutral Nations.
' The Hague, March 17, via Loudon.-
The ions of one of Holland's finest
steamships has stirred the country
deeply.. The sinking of the Tubantia
valued at fl.GOO.OOO and insured for
$1,240,000, means loss of valuable car
go space not easily replaceable.
The opinion accredited to the can-
tain that the Tubantia was torpedoed
adds to the feeling of resentment
aroused by the disaster. The Vader
land says that if the Tubanita was
sunk by a German '' submarine there
will be increasing danger that Ger
many, against hvr wishes, may find
herself in conflict with neutral statos
en account of the conduct of her sub
marine commanders.
The Courant says: "In this von Tir

land, Germany ought to be ashamed at
this fresh proof that her admiralty has
not her submarine commanders prop

TAFT DISCUSSES MEXICO
Says We Are Carrying Out Villa's
Wishes by Pursuit.
Milwaukee, WI&, ;March 16. Dis
cussing the Mexican "situation here to
day ex-President Taft said :
"This country has fthe right under
international law to ' enter Mexico in
pursuit of the bandits, headed by Villa,
because of the governmental condition
of this southern country, the Govern
ment being incapable of preventing
outlawry. The situation at best, how
ever, is extremely delicate, because in
sending troops in pursuit of Villa this
country is doing exactly what Villa
wants us to do.
' Mr. Taft said that he approved Pres
ident Wilson's refuse) to permit an
embargo on munition of war.
"I am of the oplnian that the Re
publican National Convention will not
place itself on record' as' for or against
an embargo on arms.f I think the en
tire question of the fe ar, of submar
ines, of the Bale of jirms and other
munitions, will be ignored, and that
the convention will raerely declare for
neutrality toward the warring nations
on lines defined by international law."
U-BOAT WAR GOES ON
No Change Out of Ffalgn
ation of Von
Turpsy.
Berlin, March In. German offi
cials repeat the statement that sub
marine warfare will go on in the
limits set by the German memoran
dum of last month to neutral pow
ers, but that the demands of those
who wished to see the indiscriminate
torpedoing, "whatever comes In
front of the torpedo tubes," to use
the expression of one of those who
advocate this policy, will not be ful
filled. This also is the deduction
which those acquainted with the
situation declare can be drawn from
the resignation of Admiral Von Tur
pltz, which was foreshadowed a few
days ago by the reports of his ill
ness. The 'conclusion is said to be
strengthened by the fact that Ad
miral Von Capclle has been chosen
as the new minister. He was look
ed on as the right hand man of Ad
miral Von Turplts until his retire
ment last November.
