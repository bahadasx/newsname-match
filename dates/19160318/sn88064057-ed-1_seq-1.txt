Dear Editor: I take pleasure in
ieceo:nincliding the Tyler Couinner
• cial Collcge, as the largest and
hbet institution of its kind in
. America. The advantages lei
may receive from this school are
Sunexcelled, and beyond a doubt
l greater than any offering for a
Shusiness education.
I take pleasure in sayiny that I
e do not regret reret having taken a course
w iich enabled nue to give up the
It work of teaching for that in which
SI am.l now engaged.
The great responsibility resting
upon a teacher in training and
developing the youth of the school
Sdoes not devolve upon one who
holds an offlice position.
There is more inducement in
myv present position, both finan
cially aml educationally, nmo salary
is lar:-ger, and lasts twelve months
in the \ ear instead of seven.
Lastly, when the da4's work is
over 11,th (odyv and mind can relax
Since such business worries as one
nayv have ido nt cause such mental
strain, a, those of the school room
In conclusion, I would say to
anv oine in search of a business
e li Itihnl, that vou will make no

PERCHERON IS POPULAR AS DRAFT HORSE
Percheron ,+alllon. Imported From Prance.
The flrPt Imortntlon of Percheron
stock Into th!s country was In New
Jersey In 1939. This importation, con
sisting of one stallion and two mares
was not attended with good success
for the rtallion died at sea, and one
mare was hurt from car shipment,
while the other I "led In poor healhh

to be a f ne sprr imen of the Irrccd
Fo'lowing this. Imr.ortations were
made in !S51 and ls64 In Ohio and
Massachu.etts, reseretively.
It is no": an accepted fact that the

ularity. Take the Lril!zh brceds of
draft horses. It the British drafters
were removed In any large district the
loss would hardly be noticeable, since
the Percheron ii so plentiful. A 'sexs
horseman says that without reserve
he can recommend the Percheron as
the best for the purpose of crossing
with small range mares to get salable
horses. From small range mares by
Percheron sires fine-boned animals
have resulted. To a marvelous degree
the Percheron has transmitted size,
conformation, tractability and color
through range mares.
With the circus man the gray color
wins special favor. In the first place
dappled gray is the most impressive
of any color. Then. as a rule, the
grays are the best feeders. They are
also declared to he more serviceable
than horses of other colrrs, especially
in keeping sound and enduring the
'immir h-at and vicissitudes of travel
without sickness.
