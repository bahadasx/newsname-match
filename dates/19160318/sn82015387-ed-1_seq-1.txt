DR. K. WINFIELD NEY DRAWS
LARGE AUDIENCE TO LECTURE
quito a Number of Ladies Were Among the Interested
Listeners, Some of Them Being Out of Town Vis
itors. Only Standing Room After 8 O'Clock.
The courthouse was crowded un
til there was only standing room
during Dr. Ney's war lecture, Wed
nesday evening. There were many
ladies in the audience and quite a
numoer of out-of-town visitors.
Dr. Ney was introduced by Dr. R.
B. Paine, of Mandeville, with the fol
lowing complimentary remares:
Dr. Ney has been in t:os parish
fop the past few years and ass been
president of the St. Tammany Parish
Medical Society. Dr. Ney has been
"oang quite a good deal of surgical
work, both in this perish and in New
-rleans, and hi about a year ago
4esided that he would make a visit
to-the scene of the great world war,
where he went and spent something
over five months rigat on the firing
lies, so near to it indeed that on
one occasion a shell dropped In the
operating room where he was and
miled four persons. Dr. Ney has
oomeanted to tell us some of his per
oss1 expeu lences and impressions or
thM great war, after having received
the nonor of being named the major
surgeon in chief of the Ninth Auxili
ary of the French Red Cross Society.
I now take great pleasure in intro
d4ausing Dr. Ney.
Dr. Ney's Lecture.
To start out with~1am not a pub
lie speaker, and naturally any one
in the profession I am in does not
Caltivate the voice a great deal. I
am here just simply to tell you some
things which fIay perhaps be of in
terest.
Early last year I spent severas
months in the University of Pennsyl
vania, waich has one of the best
boratories in the world, if not thl
best. A building two blocks long is
devoted entirely to experimental
surgery. You realize that in doing
this kind of work we experiment up
on the lower animals, and it is call
ed vivisection. It is a subject
which has been criticised a great aea.
by the anti-vivisectionists.While en
gaged in this work, it occurred to me
that just what we were doing was
being done with human lives. Just
about this time men Stom the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania were form
Ing a party for the purpose of going
to Paris to serve in the American
ambulance corps. I received an ap
pointment to do surgery of the brain
and spinal cord. I came home an4
surprised my wife by telling her
was going to Europe. Mr. Margar
said he did not think very much o
my judgment, but admired my court
age, however. He was able to give
me letters which were of great value
to me in getting tranaports, etc., ant
I realized that I would need every
form of identification, and needed
them badly at times. After getting
my passports and letters of intro
duction, etc., I sailed on the 3d of
July, 1915, for Europe. The day
before we sailed it was announced in
the newspapers that all the ships o
the allies were to be sunk. Conse
quently many who were to have se
cured passage failed to appear: A
few, however, did come aboard and
we had a very jolly. crowd. Most of
them were Frenchmen and nearly
all on board had something or othe:
to do with the war. The second day
out we were instructed as to our.
positions and how to get into the life
boats 'and how to use them. We
learned this lesson well. After be
ing out nine diys we entered the war
zone, and we were instructed to hay,
no lights at night. Every port hol
on the vessel was closed and there
were no lights on the deck. There
was a constant watch kept, fore and
atft, during all the day and night
Every boat was the subject of con
elderable talk among the passengers.
After we were in the war zone about
twenty-Sour hours we received a
wireless message that there was a
submarine in the neighborhood. N(
wireless messages were allowed to be
sent out, but we picked up messages
and kept in touch with the outside
world to some extent. Our captair
did not tell the passengers about thi
news of the submarine. We noticer
that the ship took a zig-zag course
sad one of the passengers though'
he saw a perFscope. One man camr
upon deck with a life preserver and
carrying one under each arm. It
was then nearly dark, and I believe
no one went'ts bed that night, but
most of us stayed on deck. Ealy
next morning we were very much re
lieved to flnd that we were still on
board a large boat, and later in the
afternoon a pilot boat came up and
we received the pilot, who was tc
take us through the mine fields on
entering the harbor.
At least a dozen searechlighte were
turned on us from boats and war
ships in the harbor and we felt se
cure. The next morning we were te
go up the river. A beautiful sight
Wuas France. Cultivated fields ever:
where, and every bit of ground war
utilised. One thing that struck me
was that no men were working in.
*h fields, the work being done en
tltaI by womena. On one or two eC,
-sio d msee men who were help
lag. but therb wore in the tr et
istle French uniform, with, red trous
ere, blue coat and red cap.
We arrived, in Bordeaux, where we
saw practically no man n , ordinary
civilian clothes, those we did see,
wearing uniforms. We saw many'
men In uniform, with arms in slings.
and heads bandaged, sad . realized
waere we were.
After we had been thoroughly In
spected and our papers were gone
over closely some of us were allowed
to land and some were returned
without landing. Our baggage was
gone througa, looking for cigars ann
matches, as you know the manufao
ture of matches is controlled by the
government, and it allows no match
as and only a small amount of to
bacco to be brought in. The street
canu In Bordeaux were being driven
py ladies as well as were wagons,
'*nd it appeared that almost all work
was being done by women while the
men were at the front.
I arrived in Parish the same night,
about S o'clock. With gr~at dialcul
ty I was able to get a taxi and or
dered it to go to a hotel recommend
ed to me, as many Americans stop
ped there and English was spoken.
I found this hotel clsed. I then
drove to another and found the
same thing. Giving up in dispair, I
told the taxi driver to dund a hotel
for me, waich he did. The next
jorning I went out to take my dire
view of Paris. I was impressed by
the great number of men in uniform.
A great many of them used crutches,
some had arms in dings, thers with
heads bandaged, all apparently with
some kind of mutilations. Every
few blocks was a -house In front ol
which hung a white flag, with a red
cross in tae center. These were the
military ospitals. In troat of the
hospitals are usually a ..mber of
motor cars which were used in
oranging the wounded from trains,
and they are constantly coming Intc
raris wita wounded soldiers from
the siont. These cars travel through
the streets with a terrik speed. ii
you are not careful taere is danger
of one being run over by these earn.
Wails in ParJs I noticed that a few
of the theatres were open for the
amusement of men irom the tront.
I also noticed that most of the wo
men I saw were dressed in black,
and their pale faces indicated that
not all of the suffering was at the
front. The following afternoon 1
paid my first visit to the. American
amonulance, which was loated a.
Neuey.
At the opening of the war certain
Americans conceived the idea of
establishing a hospital. The French
government turned over to them a
large school. This school has Just
been completed, but had never beet
occulpied. It was a Pasteur Iasti
tute and was equipped with all
X-Ray apparatus, and everything
necessary, including implements for
the extraction of steel from wounds,
and perhaps one of the flanpt dental
laboratories in the world.
It has been said that oeataln
American dentists have made the re
mark that if the lower pact of the
human face is torn away a new oun-.
tenance can be made and the mar
made to be presentable aala. It it
remarkable the advaness that have
been made in dental surgery.
The American hospital has per
haps six hundred beds. All of tht
nurses, orderlies, stretcher bearers
etc.. are Americans. The principa
thing about It Is, that it is kept au
by American donations. The ambu
lance drivers are all American boys.
Some of them are lawyers, clerks in
banks, cowboys, students, etc. Them
come to France and pay their own
passage, and they wear a uniform.
The way they have behaved under
shell fire has given them a title
known all over France, being called
"the bullet biters.'"
Having the appointment to do the
brain and spinal surgery work there,
I went over to the hospital to look
up such cases, but I was very muck
disappointed, as it ~bemed that there
were but a very few of these cases
in the hospital. With 600 beds
there were not more than 200 ps
tients. I found this was due to cr
tain Jealousies in the Freach M~edi
cal service. However, I succeeder
in finding threu ases of brain worl
In the hospital. I felt that perhaps
I had made the trip to France, eac
rifing something Inl America with
out being able to do something. The
next day I returned to theAmerican
ambulance and wus notified that they
wished a surgeon to go to Cherbourg
to see some cases eaused by shell
wounds. I went to Cherboaur and
was asked to operate on some of
Ithese mep, which I did, end while
there I was asked to take cares of
the hospital. In order to do this
work it required that I hase certain
cmredentials. I had to see the Ameri

The Case of Pearl River vs.

Friday Afternoon.
Quite a number of cases were dis
posed of in the DistriCt Court this
week. The illness of Judge Lancas
ter, necessitating a surgical opera
tion, somewhat crowded the docket,
and to relieve this situation he has
sat on the bench when he shoul
not have risked the strain, and ha
succeeded, in clearing off a good
many cases; but the present term of
court has been the most trying that
a Judge has been called upon to un
dergo. Mrs. Lancaster was sudden
ly stricken and lies seriously ill at
home, only partly conscious. The
sympathy of the community goes out
to Judge Lancaster in thes trying mo
ment, and his Adelity to duty amid
such harrowing circumstances must
be a severe strain upon his strength.
The followina cases were tried:
State vs. Bud Wise, sentenced to
penitentiary for 12 months at harq
labor.
State vs. Arthur Hunt, plead guil
ty to carrying concealed weapons,
tined $500 and costs of court.
State vs. Dave Griffin, larceny, fin

and was placed in charge of five base

It is hard for us ,to realize, with
our present civilisation, which is' de
velcled under the influences of chris
than teachings of peace and mercy/
that the nations of 3urope which
have been,. perhaps, the most ad
vaneedJn civilisation, are now wag
ing a war which is the most~ terrific,
attrocious and bloody that has ever
been known. This is a war in the
air, on the sea, under the sea and
even under the ground. This is a
war of high explosives, of long range
guns, of poisonous gases. No other
war in the history of the world will
compare with It In the slightest.
When you realie that the cities are
literally destroyed, towns wiped
from the face of the earth, you will
perhaps understand, in a way. Still
it is almost impossible to conceive its
enormity.
As I have said before, this is a
war of high qiplolsives and the
science of destruction has been so
developed that no fortflcations, no
matter how strong, can witastand
these explosives, together with tne
long-range guns of today. Fortifl
cations heretofore considered ir
pregnable have been demolished
This has resulted In what is knowu
as trench warfare. These trencher
are a number of feet deep, usually
six to eight feet, and extend across
Enurope about 450 miles, kom Swit
aerlend to the sea. These trenches
are the same all over. The oppos
ing trenches are usually 100 yards
apart, but in some cases are very
close. 'In one place I saw trenches
that were only eight yards apart.
The reason the opposing army does
not blow the others trebohes up is
because of the character of the soil
which is too hard to tunnel. They
throw bombs from one trench to
the other, and in front of the brenh.
there ir usually a fence about ten
feet high over which the bombs
are thrown. The first line of trench

THE PRETTY PARKVIEW THEATRE, COVINGTOn, LA,3
The Parkview Theatre to be Enlarged
and High-Grade Pictures Will be a
Feature of ComingySeason's Service
There is a big difference between
the picture show business of today
and that of a few years ago, It will
be remembered by ,picture show
patrons in Covington' when one-reel
pictures were the ordinary thing and
two-reel piotures were drawing
cards. During that time we had
three theatres. The first- was run
by Fred Pape in the store now occu
pied by Ryan, and the Sears show
on Boston street. Then V. H. Fred.
erick opened the Air Dome, foNowed
by Ulmer, who opened in a building
opposite the depot on New Hampshire
street. Also for a time a show was
given in the Cantrelle 'Hall. The
Air Dome had the largest seating ca
pacity, seating probably 600. It
was -then the most largely- patronized
of all the shows we had had, being
well vgntilated and 'pleasant in sum
mer otne, although the seats were
mostly benches, and was running at
the same time the Ulmer show was
running. One and two-reel shows at
5 and 10 cents, with advanced price
any time more -than three reels were
run, and often an advanced price
with three reels. Then it required
sixty minutes to show a three reel
play. Today five reels may be shown
in one hour and fifteen minutes.
There is no wait between the reels,
because two machines are used in
stead of one. People do not like to
wait. They want to be amused all
the time, and if 'there is any hitch
disapproval is announped by a pound
ing of feet.
In those days any service could be
secured that was wanted. Today the
show proprietor has freqeuntly to
take what he can get of the high
class service, and a cash deposit
must be made as a bond for good
faith; and patrons have become so
particular that it requires a cotsly
and high-grade picture to satisfy
them, and something remarkable to
justify a raise in price of admission.
But all these' difficulties have
simply lent energy to the show busi
ness. It means that only the best
may succeed. The Parkvlew Theatre
started with this idea.. The proprie.
tors built a nice little theatre and
furnished it in up-to-date style with
opera chairs and hat-racks. They
put on the best pictures they could
afford, and In brder that the theatre

Under the new management prepara .
tions were immediately begun to en

the service as far as the patron
age will permit them. Twenty
five feet will be added to the theatre
and 122 more chair will b put in.
Also the screen will be movde to the
back of the stage, so that near chair .
will be more acceptable.
The day of attending the pictreur.
show for the noielty of it is passed.
The greatest actors and actresses of
the day, the most wonderful scenery
in the world, the most remarkable :i
happenings in peace and in war and
the greatest attainments in the art
of pantomimic representation of
thought and action are pictured in
the movies of today, as well as the
greatest beauty in face and form.
Achievements on land and sea, and .;
even in the depths of the sea, are
alluring inducements to gather the...
1crowds to the picture shows.
The result of this is high salaries
and great expense of production. To
get the best pictures means the In
curring of considerable expense.
Just as the pictures you see at the
Parkview Theatre today surpass
the pictures you saw a few years ago,
so does the expense exceed that of
a few years ago. The Parkview man...
agement is desirous of putting on the
best pictures to be had from the} ';'.
Paramount, "Blue Bird" and othah~'
of the best film companies. The-,
seating capacity of the theatre is in
creased so that this may be done and
not lose money. It depends upon the
public to fill these seats and maintain
this service, if it is desired. The
theatre will do its part, and the only
limit to high-class production will
be the limit iplaced on it by the
public.
