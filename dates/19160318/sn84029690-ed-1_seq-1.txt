OBITUARY ;
On last Monday, March 13th, Mrs.
Beleke, Mrs. Hendrickson, Mrs. Averill
and Mr. Bessy were auto riding in the
country about fourteen miles north of
Ha3rs, and an accident to the car, turn
ing the car over, resulted in injuring all
of the occupants of the car, with the
exception of Mrs. Averill, and killed
Mrs. Beleke almost instantly. Thi3 is
one of the saddest events that has ever
happened in Hays and what makes the
death in this case peculiarly distressing
13 that the deceased left a family of
one son and five daughters, who about
three years ago were bereft of a fa
ther's care.
Francis Orth was the daughter of
John Orth, deceased, and was born in
Bavaria, August 2, 1S54, and came to
this country with her parents when but
eight years of age. The family settled
in Boston and after a residence there
of several years, came in the early pi
oneer days to Ellis county, settling a
few miles southeast of Hays. On
March 8, 1SSS she was married to Henry
Beleke and since then, with the excep
tion of a few years residence in Ger
many, the home has been on the farm
southwest of Hays.
She was the mother of thirteen chil
dren, six cf whom survive: Mrs Wrn .
Huck of Elli3, and Setty, Freda, Ella,
Elsie and Adolph. Besides the children
she is survived by three brothers, Mar
tin and Jacob Orth of Hays, and Valen
tine Orth of Oklahoma; also one sister,
Mrs. Barbara Hendrickson of Hays..
Mrs. Beleke was a good christian, a
kind wife, and a loving mother, neigh
bor and friend. -
The funeral was held Wednesday
morning, at the Catholic church. It
was conducted by the Rev. Fr. Vincent.
The relatives wish to express their
gratitude for the kindness and sym
pathy shown by the friends in this hour
of sorrow.

PREPAREDNESS FOR YOU
Do you know that regardless of what
disease attacks you, it is only by the
assistance of the army of white corpu
cles in your blood that you can hope to
repel the invading army of disease
germs?
PREPAREDNESS FOR YOU means
throwing off every chronic weakness or
ailment that is slowly killing off your
army of white blood corpucles, leaving
you a quick victim to any acute disease
you may encounter.
Perhaps you say, I have tried to get
rid of my rheumatism, or stomach
trouble, (or whatever you may have)
and found no cure.
Have you ever tried a reliable and
thoroughly trained specialist?
If not, you have not as yet really
made an earnest effort to get well.
The Boy Scouts.
The success with which the unprece
dented crowd during the Golden Belt
was cared for was due in a large meas
ure to the excellent work of the Boy
Scouts under the able direction cf
Scout master Harris. Finding places
for all the visiters and conducting them
about the city would have been prac
tically impossible without the boys in
khaki. They were alwa3'3 on hand
when needed to give cheerful efficient
service. They staid up all night to
meet trains; they lugged heavy grips
all over town for tired school ma'ams,
they conducted check stands; they ran
errands; they helped in the manage
ment of the crowds about the buildings;
they answered phone calls, they can
vassed the town and found rooms for
visitors when it seemed that many
visitors would be compelled to stay up
all night, always courteous, always
helpful, always on the job, these boys
proved to be real scouts.
The value of the scout work to the
boj-s cannot ba over-estimated. There
is no movement of the present day
fraught with such possibilities for
training boys into true, helpful, moral
citizens. Every town the size of Hays
could well aliorJ to employ a compe
tent man the year round to supervise
boy activities, boys and girls club work,
playground activities, etc.
Every summer a Boy Scout encamp
ment is held near Salina. Our boys
should have the privilege of going this
year. Railroad fare is practically all
the cost for a two weeks outing and
training. Next year we should have
an encampment at Hays. Who will
push the movement?
