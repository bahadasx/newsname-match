j i(h Villa if he is captured, it is re
garded as probable that if taken
alive, the bandit leader will be turn-e-;
over to the de facto government
fur prompt' execution.
That would avoid embarrassing
questions wlfich might arise if the
United States undertook to arrange
for his extradition 1o New Mexico
for trial cm the charge of murder.
Army oflirers think, however, it is
altogether unlikely that Villa will
permit himself to be inatlo prison
er. Knowing the certain fate await- i
ing him, he is expected to fight as
long as there is breath in bis body.

rOT rCLTI i rOmOííOn
Clayloti is progressing and living
so fast that it is overlooking a triv
ial matter, seemingly, yet we believe
if this very small atl'air received at
tention it would prove the greatest
little thing that ever happened for
Clayton, j
It is the
folks to re
1
matter of a place, for
t, who have no place to!
go after they have finished their
days business in Clayton.
co. H. Wade suggests a plan that
is inexpensive hence one that
should have the approval of every
one. He opines that the business
folks of Clayton should get together
and utilize one fir two of (he remain
ing vacant lots, make a small park
of it. let the merchants 'furnish
benches and erect an arbor to furn
ish shade. Mr. Wade believes that
if the club ladies could be interest
ed ill till-, lhe lillle dilllrtllly of
starling the ball rolling would lie
momentary only.
He says he is ready to furnish bis
share of the benches mid .".Ki as a
starter.
Clayton is in dire n í of just such
a place. Every day the town has
scores of visitors, who, when their
shopping and business is completed
must, either mill up and down -the
streets or go into (he business houses
which most people io not like to do.
The News is with Mr. Wade in
this suggestion.
Start it now -have I ready for the
w arm summer days.

Chas. Kilnnmilsoii of east of Clay

the solder began to pup when it
came iu contact with the water.
While it, was feared he would

PROCLAMATION
Arbor and ;icd Da.vs
several years the nation
lur several years Hie nation ha
been interested ill the rnnscrva-
tton of our natural resomres and we
have paid special attention to lhe
planting and protection of trees. We
have now discovered tin necessity
of preserving all song; and insectiv
orous birds. It. is sí. Id that if all
insect-eating birds were destroyed
this whole continent would in three
years become unini:.Uiblo by
reason of the myriads of insects. We
should bring back the birds to pro
tect our grains, plants and trees.
And. while we are impressed with
the economic value of these tilings,
we bear in mind also their esthetic
value, 'the beauty of shade and
forest trees and the sweetness of
wild birds, songs please our senses
and increase vastly our enjoyment
in lis ing.
Special days for the consideration
of these interests are necessary, as
in our rush of daily affairs Ihere is
lillle time to think carefully of
many claims upon our attention.
The days selected In New Mexico
should be observed by schools and
communities, not in idlenes . but
in practical measures lo insure the
ends we are seeking', and in such ex
ercises as shall inculcate perman
ently in our minds the habits of
thinking that shall lead to these
nds. The actual planting of trees
may be done on lie days designated
or at such other convenient, time as
may best conform I i local climatic
conditions.
THEItEFoltE, under the Acts of
the State Legislature passed "to en
courage, the planting of forest trees
for the ben, lil and adornment of
public and prívale grounds, places
and ways," ami to encourage the
protection of birds. I. William C.
