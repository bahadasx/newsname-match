As;ain the intensity of the fighting
mound Verdun has dwindled percept
ibly, only the artillery arms of the
opposing sides are nrtive. No in
fantry or counter attacks are being
engaged in.
Around Le Mort Homme, where
furious liattles have been fought re
cently comparative quiet reigns.
Lven the bombardments here are only
intermittent. There also, has been a
slackening in the fire of the his suns
in the Woevrc region to the south
west of Verdun.
Northeast of the fortress, however,
around Doiiaumont and Damloup. the
Germans are hurling shells against
I he French position, hut the French
are vigorously countering. North of
Verdun on the riant bank of the
Meuse, important (li'iman ammunition
depots have been blown up by the
French guns at ( 'hampneuville.
duly one infantry action has taken
place along the entire line from Bel
gium to Vosges. This was to the
north of the Aisne. where a German
attack against a small French post
south of the I'.ois Des Buttes was re
pulsed. 'nnstuntinople reports that the
British in Mesopotamia are in general
retreat from the English region with
the Turks vigorously in pursuit.
The hard fiShting between the Aus
tiians and Italians continues at var
ious points, especially in the Isoiv.o
region, but no important changes in
positions have resulted. Little fight
ing of importance is taking plate on
the Knjrlish front.
Petrngrad reports the capture bv
the Russians of the town of llamak
huatan from the Turks. The town it
some (10 miles west of Lrzerum 01 j
the Euphrates river.
The British Statement

while on experimental flights. Lieu

There are again persistent reports
that Turkey is preparing to abandon
the central powers and sue for
pence, according to an Athens dis
patch to tlie 1'xchange Telegraph
company. The Turkish newspaper,
