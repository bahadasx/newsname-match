I; London, March 18, 12:25 a. m. A wireless dispatch
l from Rome says that the retirement of Admiral von Tirpitz as
I German admiral of marine, was occasioned by his intention
I to attack Great Britain with the entire German navy. This
It plan was vetoed, according to these advices, by Emperor Wil-
1 ; Ham and Prince Henry.
I London, March 1 8, 5 p. m. The steamship Palembang

; Paris, March 18, 1:40 a. m. "We
I have reached the decisive hour," said
Alexander Ribot, minister of finance,
i speaking in the chamber of deputies
last night on the financial and mill-
; tary situation- "We can. say without
!i exaggeration, without illusion and
without vain optimism that we now
I see the end of this horrible war."
Ribot's utterance is taken to be of
i f the utmost importance as indicating
' official opinion with regard to the
:' battle of Verdun. Whether peace is
:', or is not appreciably nearer, it is un-
i . questionable that the tension in
? France has relaxed and that men's
? i thoughts are turned to the rapid de-
l velopment of events favorable to the
; . allies.

Review of War Situation.
Since the massed attacks of Thurs
day night against the village and fort
of Vaux, northeast of Verdun, the Ger
mans have not advanced at any point
on the defenses of the fortress, Paris
announced today.
Last night passed without infantry
activity- artdA-oven the artillery action
is described as Intermittent.
Reports of developments of import
ance in the other war fields are lack
ing. There appears to be Increasing
military activity in the Balkans, how
ever. Heavy troops movements in
Bulgaria are reported from Bucharest.
An official statement from Constan
tinople says Enver Pasha, Turkish
minister of war, has returned to Con
stantinople from a trip of inspection
to Syria, Palestine and Arabia.
Paris, March IS, 5:15 a. m. Move
ments of troops on a large scale in
Bulgaria are reported by the Havas
correspondent at Bucharest, Rumania,
In a dispatch filed on Wednesday. It
is said these operations are so ex
tensive that both passenger and
freight traffic have been suspended.
In .Rumania, the correspondent says,
passenger travel has been stopped for
ten days on the railroad running north
from Bucharest to Probeal, on the

ALLIES LOSE
DAI OF GRACE
Should Have Considered Ger
man Chancellor's Proposals
to Consider Peace When
They Had the Chance.
WILL PAY DEARLY NOW
Leading Men Lack Vision and
Understanding of Hard, Im
mutable Facts Is Com
ment of Berlin Paper.
Berlin, March 18, via London, 1:58
p. m. Germany's enemies, by not tak
ing advantage of the announcement
of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
on December that Germany would
consider peace proposals whenever
her foes are willing to ask termB,
have lost the day of grace. This is
the conclusion to bo drawn from a
leading article in the semi-official
Loknl Anzelgor, in which It Is declar
ed flatly the time has now come to
carry out tho chancellor's warning of
December that, if the enemies of this
country did not ask for peace in a
reasonable period, they would have
to pay more dearly for it.
The Lokal Anzoigor says:
Attitude Has Changed.
"According to everything one hears,
one must be convinced that our re
sponsible statesmen, in complete
agreement with tho oinilltary leaders,
now occupy a different attitude to
ward the general situation than they
occupied when tho chancellor expres
sed our readiness to enter Into peace
negotiations under certain conditions.
"Everyone has to conclude that the
leading men In the enemy camp lack
all vision of the attainable, all under
standing of the hard, immutable facts
which already had developed and
have since that time only accumulated
In greater extent."
UNLllfEDlSE
OF SUBMARINES
Liberals in Reichstag Propose
Carrying on Undersea War
fare Against Enemy and
Enemy's Traders.
Berlin, March 16, via London,
March 18, 12:15 p. m (Delayed)
The National Liberal group in tho
relchstag decided to day to intro
duce at this session its measures
calling for the carrying on of sub
marine war.
The National Liberals sent the fol
lowing message to Admiral von Tir
pitz: "We are deeply moved by the news
of tho retirement of your excellency
In the present difficult time. We
send to the creator of our navy and
the "father of the German naval spirit
assuranoes of the truest and most
thankful devotion.
Berlin, March 18, by Wireless to
Sayville. The National Liberal party
has introduced the following measure
in the relchstag:
"Considering that Great Britain not
only makes war on tho armed forces
of Germany, but has taken measures
to Impede the providing of Germany
with food supplies and raw materia
so as to compel Germany to submit
through hunger, for which purpose
Great Britain brutally violates inter
national law and employs force
against neutral countries and consid
ering further that Germany Is able
through unlimited and unrestricted
submarine warfare to increase the
British lack of tonnage so that it can
be made extraordinarily difficult and
perhaps impossible for the British
nations to obtain such supplies of
food and raw materials; considering
that such warfare would bring more
speedily a victorious end of the war,
the Imperial chancellor Is requested
to enter into no arrangements with
other countries which would hinder
us in the unlimited use of the sub
marine weapon and to permit In the
war zone, against the enemy's trad
ers, with the exception of passenger
ships, such use of submarines as aris
es from the peculiarity of said weap
on." Similar bills were brought forward
by the conservative and centre par
ties. oo

TROOPS NOT TO
occupy CITIES
United States' Forces Have No
Orders or Intention to Enter
Any Mexican Towns.
ARE PURSUING VILLA
Will Be Kept Constantly on
the Move White House
and War Department
Issue Statement.
Washington, March 18. American
troops pursuing Villa and his bandits
hayo no intention and no orders to
occupy any cities or towns during
their march into Mexico.
This was stated at the White House
and war department today after the
receipt of a dispatch stating that
General Gavlera, tho commander at
Juarez, had given notice that General
Pershing's troops would not be al
lowed to occupy Casas Grandcs, or
other towns.
It was declared bv administration
officials that the pursuit of Villa, be
ing entirely a punitive expedition, nau
none of the characteristics of an In
vasion and that there was no object
In occupying towns or cities because
the American troops will keep con
stantly on the move.
Officials said today that the situa
tion at Tampico, whore uneasiness
Is said to exist among Americans and
other foreigners, had no bearing on
the pursuit of Villa.
Reports received at both the war
and state departments today continu
ed to be optimistic.
Navy department reports today
from Vera Cruz say about 200 Ameri
cans from Mexico City and other in
treolr points have arrived there, most
of them acting upon advices from
friends and relatives in the United
States urging them to leave Mexico.
Conditions at Vor Cruz, the message
said, are quiet and many of the Ameri
cans, after investigation of reports as
to the situation are returning to the
Interior.
El Paso, Tex., March 18. Amer
ican cavalrymen were camped at
dawn today at Colonla Dublan, one
of the environs of Casas Grandes.
They arrived In tho night. Through
Colonla Dublan runs the road to the
Galaena district, 25 miles southeast,
where Villa was last definitely re
ported The news of tho encampment at
Colonla Dublan dispelled fears of any
disputes with constitutionalist authori
ties ever what position tho American
troops should occupy at Casas Gran
des. Mormon scout outriders dashed
Into Colonia Dublan last night with
the news that the Americans were
near. The column which was first
Into this important American settle
ment was said to be the cavalry from
Hacbita.
New Problem Faces Americans.
EI Paso, Tex., March 18. A new
problem faced the American troops In
Mexico as they entered tho region
, whreo tho Villa trail is scarcely throe
days old. TIiIb problem came, not
.from the Villa chase, but from the
attitude of the Carranza authorities
that they did not wish tho Americans
to occupy any Mexican city.
On the border, at least, this was re
garaed as tho most sorious-devclop-
i
ment in tho expedition of the Amer
icans. If, however, the expedition
under General J. J. Pershing should
feel compelled to occupy a city, the
Americans would be in some danger
of crossing the Mexican sense of na
tional pride in one of Us strongest
attributes.
Mexican View of Occupancy.
Occupation of a city among Mexi
can soldiers and to the mass of the
Mexican people, Is the sign of sov
ereignt3'. Some of the bloody battles
of tho last four years in Mexico have
been fought over cities whose military
importance was small, but possession
of which, according to the Ideas of
the Mexican people, Indicated domin
ance of that region. As the Carranza
authorities are not giving up their
sovereignty, It is a problem with them
to break this tradition and permit
American soldiers to occupy cities as
a base.
General Gavlera's Orders.
In his proclamation, in which he
asked the Americans not to enter or
occupy Casas Grandes, the city whose
possession means safety to the Amer
ican Mormon colonistsof that region,
General Gabriel Gavlera, commander
at Juarez, expressed no vexation at
the presence of thetf troops In his ter
ritory but he was very firm In his
announcement that under his present
instructions from General Carranza
he has no power to modify tho or
ders to his troops against permitting
the occupation of cities. The general
offered no comment on what he would
do provided the American troops oc
cupied a Mexican city.
Dispatches direct from Mexico and
the official announcements from Major-General
Funston made It evident
tocay that the two American columns,,
one from Columbus, N. M., under
General Pershing, and the other from
Hachita, N. M., under Colonel Dodd,
had gotten into close communication
with each other and probably had
formed an actual junction when a lit
tle more than half way on the route
to Casas Grandes.
Plan of Pursuit.
Something of the strategy of the
dash on Villa's trail also was appar
ent. The Hachita column made its
actual start from San Bernardino
ranch, which is in the little square 'ot
territory about the size of a large
county where the state of New Mex
ico extends some forty miles south
of the general east and west line of
the American border. By using this
American territory for the first part
of their advance from Hachita, the
flying cavalry column under com
mand of Colonel George Dodd was
able to strike into Mexico at the
shortest distance from Casas Grandes,
a little more than GO miles of march
The main column under General
Pershing at Columbus, N. M., starting
from a point considerable further dis
tant from Casas Grandes, did not go
due south but apparently veered to
the westward to got Into touch with
the cavalry commands from Hachita.
Reports here that Pershing's army
e ,) ,i not olilloVi i hnca nt fJllZ-
man were discounted in dispatches
yesterday that Guzman was still held
by Carranza troops aud that the Amer
ican columns were marching about
25 miles to tho westward. This would
put them very close to the route of
the cavalry command of Colonel Dodd.
Guzman is an Important constitution
alist garrison town, about 30 miles
directly south of the point where Gen
oral Pershing entered Mexico, and by
going past it to tho west no question
of occupation was raised.
Young American's Story.
A young American, the son of J. F.
Stanford, who arrived hero today
from Guzman, said that early yester
day he was informed that tho Ameri
can column under General Pershing
already was well to the south and
west of Guzman. Some Americans
left Guzman for the west, he said, to
see the American troops.
One of the real menaces which the
Americans In their rapid progress
southward are coutlnually leaving be
hind is tho Increasing number ot ban
dits of no party affiliation who operate
singly or In groups of two or three.
Several of these highwaymen were
located In the mountains In the vicin
ity of Guzman, When seen yesterday,
they did not offer to attack Ameri
cans traveling In small groups, but
as the lines of military communication
stretch out longer, watchfulness of
the American patrols must be con
stant to prevent these bandits from
trying "slap-dash" raids at whatever
they conceive to be' a weak and un
suspecting point. The presence of
these professional bandits geems to
be well recognized about Guzman at
least, and probably elsewhere, so that
if they ocasionally clash with the
American patrols, such 'fights do not
now seem likely to arouse any unusual
excitement.
Mr. Stanford, upon his arrival here
today said that he had come out of
Mexico via Juaroz because he heard
that he could not pass through the
lines of American troops. He Is going
to Columbus, the American expedi
tionary base.
Water has been more plentiful than
cxpeoted at many places along the
American lines of march across the
border.

iH
Vallejo, Cal,, March 18. The third class cruiser Raleigh ,H
sailed for San Diego today after taking on ammunition at Mare jH
Island navy yard. It was said here she would continue to the H
Mexican west coast. H
Douglas, Arizona, March IS. Fran
cisco Villa and a large number of
his bandits have been located near
San Geronimo, Chihauhau, and are
making their way to Namiqulpa, in
western Chihuahua, near the town of
Madera, according to a telegram re
ceived here today by Ives G. Lelevier,
consul of the do facto Mexican govern
ment. The message was from General
Luis Gutbrrez, commander of one of
the Carranza columns operating near
Chihuahua City.
General Gutierrez said that Villa
was en route to Namiqulpa, ten miles
south of Las Cruces, where Villa was
located In earlier advices to General
Caviera at Juarez, to recover a quan
tity of ammunition which he left there
several months ago.
It was said by local Mexicans that
Villa has not less than ten milloin
rounds of ammunition cached in vari
ous parts of Chihuahua. These shells
and powder were made by Villa, they
said, in his Chihuahua munitions fac
tory during last year.
The message from General Gutier
rez did not contain any information
as to the size of the cache at Nami
qulpa, nor was there any local infor
mation concerning the amount of am
munition hidden there.
Carranza Officer Arrives.
Lieutenant-Colonel Dato Campbell,
in command of the Carranza troops
guarding the mountain passes along
the Sonora-Chlhuahua state line, ar
rived In Agua Prieta last night and
held a conference today with General
P. Ellas Calles, military governor of
Sonora.
Colonel Campbell came to Agua
Prieta to confer with General Calles
concerning the disposition of his
troops and to obtain a new supply of
food and cartridges. He stated that
he believed that Villa would not be
able to enter Sonora and, at the same
time, said that In his opinion the
United troops would have much diffi
culty in capturing the bandit chief.
Campbell reported that Villa was In
Galaena, Chihuahua, last Monday, go
ing from there to Janos, where he
carried off all available supplies.
The colonel said that while the
American troops were searching for
Villa in the mountains in western Chi
huahua the bandits likely would con
duct raids along or near tho Texas
border in the eastern part of the Mexi
can state.
Mutiny at Hermoslllo.
Nogales, Ariz., March 18. Trouble
in tho constitutionalist garrison at
Hermosillo, Mex., was reported here
today. Its nature could not be veri
fied. Among other reports there
was said to be a mutiny but this has
not been established as a fact.
Pershing to Use Discretion.
San Antonio, Tex., March 18.
Whether the American troops that ar
rived last night at Casas Grandes en
ter tho town or not Is for General
Pershing to decide, said General Fun
ston today. Unless otherwise in
structed by the war department, Gen
eral Funston is disposed not to inter
fere with the details of General Persh
ing's operations.
"It Im quite true," General Funston
said further, "that our forces have
no instructions to, nor intention of oc
cupying any town in Mexico but a
situation might arise in which the
passing through some town might be
regarded as a military necessity.
Goneral Funston this afternoon had
received no official confirmation of
tho arrival at Casas Grandes of a
part of tho expeditionary force, but
he assumed the correctness of tho .re
port. General Pershing's west, col
umn, under Colonel Dodd, had Casas
Grandes as Its immediate objective,
but itr arrival last night was a sur
prise to those at headquarters who
had not believed it likely that the
distance would bo covered quite so
quickly.
March Is Uninterrupted.
The main column, according to the
latest reports from General Pershing,
was continuing its march without in- W
terruption not far northwest from tho H
advance cavalry force. H
Reports to army headquarters indi- H
cated Villa still is in the region about H
Galaena. H
The work of organizing the addi- H
tional forces that have been sent into
Texas and New Mexico along the bor- ;IH
der was continued today. From many H
places near the border, where the H
population is largely Mexican, appeals IH
for the protection of troops have been pH
made, but these appeals have been IH
based on no overt hostile act of the H
Mexicans.)
The garrison at Nogales will not be H
materially weakened, although the re-
moval of one company of infantry ll
brought a protest to General Fun-
Battleship Sails With Marines. IH
