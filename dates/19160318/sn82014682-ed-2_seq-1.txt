Dear Sir:, By Instruction of our

date of March 2 by Mr. E. D, Tenfiey
-to Mr. J. F. C Hagens. In default of h

' ' Dear Sir: ' Now that the Carnival is
' over, u may be that you are prepared
' to devote your energlea to the eoletioa
of problems which have been brought
very prominently to 4 the tore during
- the past few weeks. One of these is
hotel accommodations ; for the larg!
' tiuraber of -tourist who are attracted
here primarily, we suppose, hy ths
: Carnival itself. In a recent letter from
, Capt Matson. be writes aa follows:
lt seems to me as' though ;
Botriething should be done with th
- ' hotels In Honolulu. Money' Is
" plentiful now, and I think that ;
the people who have at Interest
' ' the welfare of Honolulu should be :
willing to do something. A new ',
company should be formed to tak
I " over the Moana hotel and build a :
new hotel with accommodations
for, aay, 1000 people, to be run in ;
: connection therewith. The ques
tion of providing additional hotel
accommodation should be . start-
ed now, when there Is plenty of
- - money and. If the Matson Navl-
- gallon' Company- had to, I think
; ;' ' we could take ah. Interest in such
.--l' hoteL; There are1 a great many
people who want to know, before
: taking a jtrlp to the islands. If they
.. . can be sure of hotel, accommoda
tions and we being unable to as
. sure them- of such accoramoda-
Hons, they do not go. 1 think. If
v there was a good tropical hotel in
Honolulu, the . people would stay
. there all winter."-! .:V:" :

. When asked whether or not the fact
hat many of the parents were born In
Japan would lead them to urge the

might have been true, but at the pres
