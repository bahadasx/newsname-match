States New "Order in Council"
of Great Britain Yes­

ALSO BARBED ENTRY
Action Forced on Country by the
Shortness in Tonnage Caused
by German Submarines.
London, March 17.—A far-reaching
order-in-council which will totally pro­
hibit importation into the United
Kingdom of a large number of articles
which come under the general head­
ing of luxuries will be issued by the
British government at an early date.
Includes All Countries.
Among the things placed under the
ban will be automobiles for private
use, musical instruments, cutlery of
all kinds, hardware, yarns, chinaware,
fancy goodsand soaps. The order will
apply equally to all countries includ­
ing the British dominion and colonies.
This forecast of the coming order
in-council was given to the Associated
Press today in an interview by Wal­
ter Runciman, president of the board
of trade. Mr. Runciman admitted
that articles in addition to those nam­
ed would be placed on the list of pro­
hibited imports but in advance of the
issuance of the order he declined to
say what they are. He agreed that
the decree wo uld have considerable
effect on exports from the United
States, 'but pointed out it applied to
all countries alike and declared it was
absolutely necessary to limit the ship­
ment of bulky luxuries in order to pro­
vide room on ships for necessaries.
Shortness of Tonnage.
"But please remember," said Mr.
Itunciman, "that the issuance of this
order is forced on the country—not
as a matter of policy but entirely be­
cause of a shortage in tonnage. We
want exports from the United States
want yp^r jyhe^cottpfl
and we need othef things Whicli 'w(
ctpinot get if the space aboard ves
sels is taken up with luxuries.
Doing All Possible.
"Everything possible is being done

sbipr- flying, the British flag is now

w#or ,-li^8efjtr Whether
it wiljr-,be
necessary- to requisition
more vessels I cannot say, but for my
own part, I hope this will not be
done."
Fresh Fruit Next.
Mr. Runciman said the importation
of some fresh fruit probably would be
prohibited later, but he pointed out
that this would affect the United
States only slightly. Turning from
the matter of imports to the general
industrial situation in the British
Isles, Mr. Runciman said there never
had been greater activity in the larj
er industries that wages were higher
than ever before, and that the per­
centage of unemployed never had
been so small In the history of the
country."
Washington Expected Order.
Issuance of new orders-in-council re­
stricting imports into the United King­
dom had been anticipated here in
Washington for some time, but the be­
lief has been that they would apply
only to neutral countries and not to
Canada or other British possessions.
American trade will be seriously af­
fected by tne action, but it is realized
since there is to be no discrimination
there will be no ground for protest by
the United States.

Chicago, March 17.—High tribute

part they have taxen in the develop­
ment fthe United States by William
H. Taft, in an address delivered here
tonight at the St.. Patrick's day ban­
quet of the Irish Fellowship club.
"There has been an easy amalgama­
tion of the Irish with our American
life," said Mr. Taft. "They have add­
ed much to the composite Americans
made from various European stocks.
They have softened the American wit.
hey have added to American tender­
ness. They have increased the spirit
of good fellowship, added to our so­
cial graces, increased our poetical
imagination and made us more opti­

Supreme Court Decides an Im­
portant Question on Alien­
ation.
A case that has attracted much at­
tention for a long time and which has
gone through the district court and
been appealed to the supreme court
by the defendant, was decided yester­
day and the opinion was written by
Chief Justice Fiske. The style of the
case was: Mrs. Eva Rott versus
Helen Goehring, and was brought for
alienation of a husband's affections.
The history of the case developed
in court some very interesting mat­
ters, and when the post cards from
the defendant to the husband of the
complainant were read, the gravity of
the assemblage was gravely shaken.
Likewise when the cards, letters and
other matter were given in the de­
fense to show that the defendant had
not been to blame, some racy and in­
teresting material was read before
the court.
$5,000 Was Sought.
Mrs. Itott sued for $5,000, but the
court allowed only $1,500. This was
sustained by the supreme court with­
out change.

TO EUROPE
Washington, March 17.—The Unit­
ed States shipped 678,443 horses and
mules, valued at $131,914,000, to Eu­
rope for the allied armies in the last
year and a half, according to export
figures assembled today in the bureau
of foreign and domestic commerce.
During the whole of 1913, only a
few more than 30,000 horses and
mules went to Europe from the Unit­
ed States, but three months after
Hostilities began they were going at
the rate of 30,000 a month. The
steady flow reached its height last
October, when 60,000 were shipped.

One thousand people greeted Esta

for president. Mr. Estabrook was
greatly pleased with the way things

kota. Mr. Estabrook will close his
campaign in a speech at Grand Forks
Saturday night.
The fact that the people were in ig­
norance of Senator LaFollete's vote
in congress on the tariff measure has
had much to do with the popularity of
the Wisconsin man's candidacy in
North Dakota, as he was the only re­
publican in congress voting with the
democrats in favor of the low tariff on

London, March 17.—Again the in­
tensity of the fighting around Verdun
has dwindled perceptibly. Only the
artillery arm of the opposing forces
are active. Xo infantry or counter-at­
tacks are being engaged in.
Around Le Mort Homme, where fur­
ious battles have recently been fought,
compartive quiet reigns. Even the
bombardments here are only intermit­
tent.
Northeast of the fortress, however,
around Douaumont and Apremont, the
Germans are hurling shells against
the French positions. Isorth of Ver­
dun near the right bank ol' the Meuse
important German ammunition depots
have been bliwn up by the French
guns at Champneuville.
Constantinople reports Unit the Brit­
ish in Mesopotamia are in general re­
treat from the Felahie region, with
the urks in pursuit.
The hard lighting between the Ital­
ians and Austrians continues at var­
ious points, especially in the lonzo re­
gion, but no changes in positions have
resulted. Little fighting of import­
ance is taking place on the Russian
front.
Petrograd reports tin capture of the
town of Mamakhuapau by, the Rus­

Turkey Wavering.
There are again persistent reports
that Turkey is preparing to abandon
the Central Powers and sue for peace,
according to an Athens dispatch to
the Exchange Telegraph Co. The
newspaper, Moudjahebe, of Saloniki
says Turkey is preparing to announce
to the Entente allies through the
American embassay at Constantinople
the willingness to co-operate with the
Ententes against Bulgaria.

Socialist Member Only One Who
Is Opposed to the
Program.
NEXT WEEK BEFORE
VOTE IS TAKEN
Many Amendments Are Being Of­
fered to the Committee's
Bill.
Washington, March 17.—National
defense legislation overshadowed
every other legislative business to­
day. The fact standing out most
sharply from a whole day of debate
and discussion was that only one
voice had been raised against mili­
tary preparedness as a national pol­
icy—that of Meyer London of New
York, f,he only socialist member of
congress. The house completed more
than half of its' sot scheduled ten
hour debate on the army bill. More
than two scores of: members express­
ed their views. l!hi' great majority
favored the committee bill, which is
fhe most sweeping military measure
ever considered in peace times. Many
amendments to be offered were an­
nounced, and the prospect of passing
the bill by tomorrow night virtually
vanished. It may tie next week be­
fore the vote is taken.
In 1he senafe Chairman Chamber­
lain announced he would seek to have
the military committee's perfected
army bill taken up next Monday.
Attacked Sharply.
The bill was attacked sharply in the
house by Representajive Gardner of
Massachusetts, republican. He de­
clared that while "it makes a noise
like preparedness, it is not a very
noisy noise." To support, his assault
on the figures as to what the bill
would accomplish, as prepared by
Representative Hay, Mr. Gardner
read a copy of lot ter from Sec­
retary ',t&ker,' thtrhew' head' of Die
war department.
The latter disputed the accuracy of
the figures by which Mr. Hay sought
to show that, 1,321,790 men would be
immediately available for the nation­
al army if the house bill were enact­
ed. Using the same method of cal­
culation as that employed by Mr.
Hay, it said, "we should have now
available without any legislation 1,
281,7JM) men, who have had some mil­
itary training.
OPPOSES PUGET SOUND.
Washington March 17.—Rear Ad­
miral Benson, chief of the bureau of
operations, told the committee today
that San Francisco bay should have
a navy yard "adequate to build as
many battleships as might be neces­
sary for the Pacific coast. He said
a first class plant there would be
vastly more valuable than one at
Puget, Sound and that he did not fa­
vor the $2,000,000 appropriation pass­
ed by the senate yesterday for im­
provement of the Puget Sound yard.
San Francisco, the admiral argued,
was more central than Puget Sound.
LANE REPRESENTS WILSON.
San Diego, March 17.—Franklin K.
Lane, secretary of the interior, and
Mrs Lane arrived tonight for the dedi­
cation tomorrow of the Panama-Paci­
fic International exposition. Mr. Lane
is here as the personal representative
of President Wilson.

Captains.
Washington, March 17.—The text
and appendices of the German memor­
andum, by which neutral nations were
notified that armed merchant ships of
the nations at war with Germany
would be treated as war vessels, were
made public by the state department
today.
Except for slight variations in trans­
lation, the texts are identical with the
versions given out in Berlin and sent
to the United States in press dis­
patches.

The documents include what is pur
ported to be copies of instructions to
British "sea captains for guidance and
use in maintaining armament cap
tured oil British ships.
The TBritish version differs mate­
rially from the Germans. This has
ben explained by the statement that
the instructions made public in Lon
don were of later date than those in
German possession It had already
been said at the state department that
the question will be viewed by this
government in the light of the in
structions which are in force at pres
ent.

Cavalry Leave Columbus and Pro

Columbus, Tex., March 17.—Two
half squadrons of cavalry left the ex­
peditionary main base here today,
striking in a westerly direction.
Whether they were intended to rein­
force the punitive columns was not
known. One report, indicated that
they were going out, to help protect
the line of communication of that
portion of the expedition under Col.
George Dodd, which three days ago
circled to the westward TiO mile
•from here and entered Mexico about
the same time with the main column,
which went directly south from here.
Troop trains overnight swelled the
Columbus camp to what, is said to be
nearly the size of the original ex­
pedition.
The report that several men on out­
post duty with the expedition had
been wounded by snipers has not
been confirmed here.
Reliable reports here indicate that
some of the large ranching and cat­
tle interests on the Mexican side of
the border have offered a reward of
$50,000 for Villa, dead or alive.
A Carranza garrison occupies Guz­
man and their commander said today
he had every confidence in the abil­
ity of his troops to maintain order
at Guzman.

CONDITIONS IN INTERIOR
ARE VERY QUIET
Washington, March 17.—The main
American expeditionary force in Mex­
ico as late as this afternoon had en­
countered none of Villa's outlaws. Re­
ports to this effect were received by
the war department in field wireless
messages, relayed by telegraph from
a point along the international border.
In the senate today, a concurrent,
resolution by Senator LaFollette de­
claring that congress approved the
use of the army to pursue Villa, and
giving further assurances that' the sov­
ereignty of Mexico was not to be en­
croached upon by the punitive expe­
dition was unanimously adopted with
out debate.
Reports to the state and war de­
partment indicated that conditions
generally in the interior of Mexico
were fairly quiet.
Consular advices to the state de­
partment were to the effect that quiet
prevails in virtually all sections of
Mexico, with the exception of Tampi
co and Torreon. At Tampico and in
the adjacent oil fields, Americans
were reported to be uneasy although
no disorders had developed.

CHIEF EXPECTED TO

All Plans Point to Prolonged
Guerrila Warfare With His
Followers.
El Paso, Texas, iMarch 17.—One of
the American columns in Mexico was
definitely located tonight on the out*
skirts of the Cazas Grandes region,
between the towns of Janos and As­
cension, in a statement issued by
General Gavira, Carranza commander
at Juarez.
General Gavira announced that he
had a telegram that a courier from
the Americans who already had
reached Cazas 'Gran^ek announcing
that the United States troops might
be expected about midnight. The
general said he had wired Lieutenant
Colonel Refugio S. Davila, in coin*
mand of the constitutionalist gafri
son at Cazas Grandes, not to peratit
the Americans to occupy that city.
American troops will reach Cazas
Grandes at midnight, General Gabriel
Gavira announced at Juarez late to*
day. Cazas Grandes is a little mora
than 60 miles frp rathe port where
Col. TI. J. Dddd's cottimns' entered'
Mexico, so that the Americans had
been moving more than 30 miles a
day.
Simultaneously came the first inti­
mation of activity on the part of'the
Villistas and of their Intention'id're­
sist the American expedition ill' news
received that Villa's followers hfed
burned a railroad bridge 6n the North*
west rallrdad 6f Mexico, 'between
Summit and San 'Pedro, Chihuahua::
'General Gavira's information pre*
sumably refers to fhe force made up
of the Seventh and Tenth Cavalry,
which crossed the border near Hach
ita, N. M., and is said to be advanc*
ing by forced marches to protect the
Mormon colony, Colonia Dublan.
The two towns mentioned, Janos
and Ascension, are between 60 and
(!5 miles directly south of Hachita*
on the Janos river. Janos, the most
southerly of the two, is about 20 miles
from Corralitos, near where the rail­
road bridge was burned.
On Northwestern Road.
The burned bridge was on t*10
Northwestern railroad between Sum­
mit and San Pedro and directly in
the line of advance of the main ex­
peditionary force which started from
Columbus and would strike the rail­
road at Guzman, 40 miles north of
Corralitos. It was close to the latter
place that the Villistas are said to
have murdered five Mexican ranchers
on Sunday and driven off their horses.
Intense Activity.
Arrivals from Columbus today re*
ported intense activity at the Ameri­
can military base. They said fresh
troops were being sent forward across
the border both night and day and
that one aeroplane had joined the
force in 'Mexico. Seven other air
craft were circling over the border
constantly on a scouting expedition.
Reach Villa Territory.
"With the practical certainty that
the American soldiers had at least
reached the Villa territory, the ques­
tion of absorbing interest on the bor­
der as to how many men are witk
Villa and will he fight or run? Am*
ericans from the Cazas Grandes re*
gion assert that peons there are cer*
tain to support Villa, partly through
his system of terrorism and partly
through the glamor of his reputation
as a warrior.
The Carranza officials here and In
Juarez insist that Villa has disband*
ed whatever men he had with him
and will not offer to fight, hut will
rely for safety on his Itnowledge of
the Sierra Madres, which he knows
by heart.
Fear Guerrila Campaign.
Americans who know Villa and the
country in which he has taken ref­
uge are equally confident that he will
attempt to check his pursuers by a
guerrila campaign.
The tension between the two na­
tions at this point on the border was1
noticeably sharper today, as far as
Juarez was concerned. General Ga­
vira coupled his announcement as to
the whereabouts of the American.

would no longer receive American
