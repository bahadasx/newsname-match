two Chickasha boys, tho latter a mes
senger in the employ of the Postal
Telegraph company, lost their wheels
Thursday night.
Inday afternoon, as Young Paxton
was walking down Chickasha avenue
he. recognized his wheel being ridden
by a stranger. Shouting to the
rider only served tp cause him to ac
celerate the speed at which he wa
tiaveling.
Paxton hailed a passing service car
and gave the fellow a merry chase
which resulted in his abandoning the
wheel in the outskirts of the city and
taking to his heels. Sharpo has heard
nothing ot his wheel, however.
CANDIDATE
FOR C0.COM.
li. A. Thompson of Ninnekah,
known to nearly everybody as "Uncle
Bob." has again cast his hat into the
ling for county commissioner of the
."outhern district, making his formal
announcement for the office and
checking the matter up to the Demo
cratic voters.
Two years ago Mr. Thompson was
a candidate for the same office and
he missed the prize by the narrow
margin of only eight votes. "I had
not expected to be a candidate again,"
ra'.d he, "but wit'ain the past few
weeks so many of my friends have
spoken to me about it that I decldcl
to make the race again."
Mr. Thompson has lived In this sec
tion for nearly 23 years, having moved
to old Indian Territory from his na
tive state, Mississippi, and engaged
in the farming and stock raising bus
iness which he still follows. He is a
man who enjoys the highest confi
dence and and respect of all who
know him. lie says:;
"The only promise I make to the
people is the one I made two year?
ago, and that is, in the event of my
election. I will endeavor to handle
the business of the county exactly as
I would If it were my own business.
To those who know me I hope it Is
not necessary to say that I shall make
the race on whatever merits of my
own I may possess and shall not have
any criticism for anybody else."
FIRE OUTSIDE LIMITS. ,
No. 1 station of the Chickasha fire,
department was called to a fire north

Grady County Republican Convention Opens

Preside by Vote of
32 to 17
HARRIS FOLLOWERS
SHOWING NO FIGHT
Peace Prevails During First Stage, With
Suggestion of Steam-Roller; Unin
structed Delegation is Ex
pected to Be Program
.The report that tho fire alarm that
was heard about 1 o'clock emanated
from a folate at the city hall, due to
a red hot county Republican conven
tion, was a mistake. Up to 2:20 p
in. there had been no jign of a con
flagration in that quarter but, on the
contrary, everything - was moving
along as quietly as an Epworth
League meeting, although therq were
indications o a subterranean com
motion which might at any time re
sult in an eruption.
The McGraw faction won tho first
fall when they captured the tempor
ary chairmanship of the convention,
Col. T. Ii. Dwyer being elected to
this position by a vote of 32 to 18. In
dicating that the professed confidence
of the Harris followers, voiciferously
oiced dur.'ng the past few days, rest
ed on a foundation of false hopes,
The Hs.rris contingent apparently
made no effort when the final moment
ct battle arived but sat back and
good naturedly swallowed their medi
cine, content with quietly suggesting
that the steam-rolltr was operating
ery successfully.
At the opening of the convention i
was understood that the plan of the
McGraw men did not contemplate an
instructed delegation to the state and
congressional conventions although it
was meant to make sure that none
but loyal friends of the "new deal"
were placed on the delegations.
About o'clock it wag learned that
the count of noses having shown that
the delegates were divided in the pro
iortion of 21 for Harris and 26 for
McGraw, with doubt as to whether
some of them would stand hitched, an
greement was reached between J. W.
Kayser, McGraw leader, and W. W.
Holl:ster, captain ot the Harris co
horts, to the effect that the delega-
on should go uninstructed. It w-as
greed that M. K. Humphrey would be
unanimously supported for delegate to
the national convention.
At 3:30 the convention voted, by a
arge majority to send an uninstruct
ed delegation.
