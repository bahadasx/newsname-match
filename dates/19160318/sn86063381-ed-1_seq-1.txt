St Paul, Minn., March 18.When
Austin of Minneapolis crept
into one of the four leading positions
in the Democratic-at-large race to
day the anti-Lynch men made the
claim that they have definitely pre
vented the election of Fred B. Lynch
as national committeeman.
"If we can do nothing more we at
least can force a compromise," said
Mr Austin. "Mr. Lynch cannot be
re-elected The party could not af
ford to retain a man at its head when
the rank and file are so evenly di
vided The thing to do now is to find
a man to unite the elements."
Anti-Lynch men claim that 12 of
the 24 Democratic delegates-elect will
stand against the present committee
men, and possibly one or two more.
They claim, on more complete re
turns, to have elected Andrew Dono
van in the third district, Guy A.
Thomas in the tenth and W. F. Don
ohue in the sixth. If Austin and C.
King are both elected at large
and E. C. Hawkins in the seventh dis
trict, they claim 12 anti-Lynch men.

win. Another report is that Be

St Cloud and Wadena fans stated
today that if Bemidji plays the same
kind of a game played last week,
there will be no question about the
outcome of the game.
