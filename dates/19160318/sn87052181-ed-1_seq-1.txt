DO WE EAT MORE BUTTER?
Dealers Attending Convention In Kan.
sas City Say the Visible Sup
ply Is Very Low.
Are the pooplo ot tho United States
eating more butter?
Members of tho Missouri Carlot
Shippers' Association ot poultry, oi
butter and egg dealers, which mot In
convention In Kansas City recently
and gave credence to this assertion.
Tho supply of butter stored In forty-
flvo cities Is 5 million pounds less
than at tho llrst ot March a year ago.
If more butter Is not being eaten, pro
duce men havo uo explantlon to
offer.
Eastern dealers who havo coma to
Kansas City to meet tho shippers, pre
dict higher butter prices, it is not
likely that a break will come before
lato In May. At that time the "grass
butter" will bo offered.
About eggs It is n different story.
The dealers who stored great quanti
ties In 1915 havo suffered. Tho losses
wero so heavy that tho firms that
usually buy thousands of cases at
about this season of tho year nro a
bit Rhv. Tlin weather Is to blame, they
say. The summer ot 1915 was cool. j
Instead ot tho usual 45 per cent wast-
ago In the stored eggs, less than 10 per
cent was not of market value, accord
ing to Ralph Hurst, secretary ot the
association. Thorcfore there will not
bo a big demand for eggs by tho specu
lator and consequently tho farmer will
not receive high prices.
A prediction made at the Hotel Balti
more convention headquarters was
that tho country merchant would pay
about fifteen cents a dozen for eggs
when the storago season opened. It
was based on tho belief that prevalent
prices at Kansas City, Chicago and
New York would be about seventeen,
eighteen and nineteen cents, respec
tively. Tho unusual condition of the mar
kets caused a big attendance at tho
convention.
MARTIN EXPELLED FROM M.U.
Committee of- Deans Found the Sensa
tional Charges Made By School
Papei- Editor Untrue.
Walter Claro Martin of Lamar, Mo.,
editor of tho Research, a "reform"
paper, was expelled from Missouri
University the other day by the com
mittee of deans, composed of tho heads
of the several divisions of tho uni
versity. The committee's report said
Martin had been dismissed for "reck
less and Inexcusable publication of de
famatory charges against fellow stu
dents." Martin's dismissal camo only after
many weeks of discussion of his case
by different bodies of the university,
Martin and tho Research occupying
the limelight-all tho while and throw
ing tho university into an unprece
dented uproar.
Martin alleged he was kidnapped by
four students and taken to tho coun
try In a motor car, whero he says he
was thrown out ot tho car. Tho story
attracted statowlde Interest and
caused much criticism.
The case went to tho committee of
deans after Martin had refused to com
ply with tho request of tho student
senato that ho prove his charges or
make a public retraction.
Martin said that although expelled,
ho probably would remain in Colum
bia, as ho Intends issuing another Re
search. The next Issue will deal fur
thor with fraternities, ho said, al
though he will also discuss hazing In
tho university and probably tho action
of tho university authorities in dis
missing him. It has been reported
that ho Intends attacking tho Colum

INE Indians, and only
Era k v3(r!a nme' are au lnat romain
K3K NfiSl ot flvo tribes which had
much to do with tho
making of American his
tory, according to tho
United States Indian census report
which was Issued recently. Tho Poo
sepatuck, Plankashaw, Mattapony,
NIantic and Wea tribes aro on the
very verge of extinction. Of the Poose
patuck, an Algonquian tribe, which
was ono of tho thirteen found by tho
whito men on Long Islaad, thoro is
but ono- lono relic, an Indian living
somewhere in tho stato ot Now York.
Tho Poosepatucks once occupied tho
Long Island, shore from Patchoguo to
tho Shlnnock country. In 1666 Chief
Tobaccus was given a reservation of
50 acres on Forge river near Mastic,
Long Island, and In 1832 Elizabeth Joe,
tho tribo's woman sachem and its last
chief, died, in 1S90 tho trlbo num
bered ten families, governed by thrco
trustees, and in 1910, tho last census
year, tho government nose hunters
could find but ono Pooscpatuck left.
In Virginia tho census enumerators
found the last of tho trlbo of the Mat
tapony, tho red men whom doughty old
Capt. John Smith, ho who was saved
by Pocahontas, called the "Matta
paraont." This was one of the Bmaller
tribes of tho powerful Powhattan con
federacy and tho Jamestown colonists
heard their war whoops and tho whis
tle of their arrows. In 1006 tho Mat
tapony lived on tho Mattapony river
in Virginia, and when Thomas Jeffer
son wroto about them in his "Notes
on Virginia" in 1825, tho trlbo num
bered only 20 souls, most ot them
largely of nogro blood nnd closely ro
tated to the Pamunkoy trlbo ot Vir
ginia. Connecticut could show but ono
member ot tho historical Niantic trlbo
when tho Indian census was taken.
Back in the days when tho Puritans
quarreled with tho Manhattan Dutch
over tho fertllo acres along tho Con
necticut river, the Nlantlcs lived on
tho Connecticut const, subject to the
Pequots who nearly exterminated tho
tribe In the Pequot war of 1637. Their
victors placed tho Nlantlcs under tho
rule ot tho Mohcgans. Colonial his
tory records tho fact that in 1638 thero
wero about a hundred Nlantlcs in Con
necticut and this number had dwin
dled to 85 In 1761. A few years later
most ot them joinod the Brotherton
Indians In New York and woro bonovo-
lently assimilated. Another Niantic
tribe lived in Ithodo Island nnd, by
refusing to tako part against tho
whites in tho King Phillip war, re
tained their tribal integrity for a time,
but, as thoy wero closoly related to
tho Narraganscts thoy, eventually,
wero absorbed into that tribe.
When C.ntiller La Sallo, in 1032,
wroto back to Franco nbout tho In
dlnns around Ills fort on tho Illinois
river whero . Peoria now stnnds, he
mentioned tho Plailkashaws, n trlbo
whjch figured largely In tho story of
Indiana hnd Illinois. Their ancient
village was on tho Wabash river near
tho Junction with tho Vermilion. Thoy
occasionally spread over Into Illinois
and from all accounts wero particular
ly pestiferous in their Intercourse with
tho whites. In 1832, with somo neigh
boring tribes, thoy moved Into Kansas
and later consolidated with tho mini,
known as 1'eorlas and Kaskasklas,

Indians Remain
Nations Which Had Much
Making'; American History
Just after tho Civil war tho consoli
dated tribes sold their Kansas 'land
and emigrated to Indian territory,
whero they woro known as Peorlas.
At that tlmo tho Plankashaws num
bered something less than ono hun
dred. Thero aro just two of them left
and both wero counted among tho Ok
lahoma Indians. TJio Plankashaw
was ono of tho few tribes whoso male
mombers could becomo citizens of tho
United States by treaty stipulation.
In Indiana tho census enumerators
found two Weas and in Oklahoma two
moro; tho remnant of this sub-tribe
of tho Nlami Indians and neighbors ot
tho Plankashaws. They first wero
mentioned by tho Jesuit ' fathers as
living in eastern Wisconsin, but thero
wero Wea towns on the St. Joseph
river In northern Indiana. Pero Mar
quette found a Wea town on tho pres
ent slto of Chicago, and they were
thero In 1701 when Courtcmancho pad
dled up tho creek which now is tho
Chicago rlvor. Tho Weas seemed to
havo been naturally scrappy, for thoy
always were In trouble with the white
pioneers, and in 1791 United States
troops cleaned out a number of their
villages. In 1820 they moved, with tho
Plankashaws, into Illinois and then
Knnsas, nnd they, too, stipulated in
their peace treaty with tho govern
ment that their males could becomo
citizens.
Some of the tribes whoso names
wero frequently mentioned in the
quaint reports ot colonial tlinos and
who gavo tho heroes and heroines to
tho early writers ot romantic- Indian
tales, now aro represented by mere
handfuls, somo of them living far
from tho homes ot their ancestors.
Thus, of tho Mohawks thero aro only
36$ on tho census rolls; tho.Cayugas
number but 81; tho Mohcgans havo
dwindled to 22; the Montauks to 29;
tho Narragansets to a paltry-10; tho
pamunkoys to S3; the Poquots to CG;
tho Powhatans to 131; tho Passama-
quoddles to 308; tho Chtckahomlnles
to 115; tho Catawbas to 124; tho Shin-
nccocks to 107; nnd tho Pcnobscots to
266. But there aro still 914 Dela
wares; 2,436 Onoldas; 2,907 S.enocas;
533 Stockbridges; and 400 Tusca
roras. Tho figures given In the report of
tho commissioner ot Indian affairs do
not ogrco with the census figures, for
tho commissioner shows a steady In
creaso in Indian population from 228,
000 in 1890 to 297.023 in 1910. Tho In
dians are divided into 280 tribes com
prising 52 linguistic stocks. Tho most
Important tribes, numerically, aro tho
Cherokee, with 31,489 members; tho
Navajo, with 22,455; tho Chippewa,
with 20,214; tho Choctaw, with 15,917,
and tho Teton Sioux, with 14,284.
Thirty-nine other tribes havo over

with tho mixed bloods, ho writes as
follows
"It Is Important to noto that nil

"Tho degree of blood admixture Is

are ot white, Indian and negro mix-
turq. 'Other mixtures' aro reported

west nlong the Canadian boundary to
tho coast, and includes North Dakota,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New
York and Maine. These states, with
Texas on tho south have only from
40 to 55 per cent of full bloods. Orjy
two states rango In tho 25 to 40 per
cent column. Oddly enough thoso
are Kansas ana UKianoma. urns
means that old Indian territory
with Its Flvo Tribes and other Indian
occupants, and Kansas with its Pot
tawatomlos and Kickapoos havo full
bloods only In proportions of from 25
to 40 per cent. In Massachusetts. Ala

full-blood Indians are less than ten per
cent of tho Indian population.
"Tho racial purity ot tho peopla
enumerated as Indians is of pertinent
Interest In tho determination of tho
ultlmato fnto ot tha raco as an un
mixed stock. The available number ot
individuals upon which tho figures aro
based is 247,137. Of this number 150,
053 aro full bloods, 93,423 mixod bloods
and 3,661 with blood status not report
ed. It appears from thoso figures that
tho full bloods still constitute the ma
jority, but, ns later will nppcar, tho
degreo of fecundity is less In tho full
bloods and greater in mixed mar
riages. Thus in tlmo Indian blood
will becomo entlroly diffused. It will
tako centuries and, perhaps, many
of them beforo the traces of American
Indian blood are eliminated. Ot tho
Indians classed under theso figures
125,654 aro males and 121,483 females.
Thero aro 75,667 full-blood males and
74,386 full-blood females Among tho
mixed bloods tho males also form tho
majority, tho figures being 48,157 to
46.2CG females. Of tho total mixed
blood Indians 45,384 males aro Indian
and whlto to 42.CS2 females."
