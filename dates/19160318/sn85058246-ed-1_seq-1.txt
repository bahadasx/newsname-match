Tho Birth of a Nation, which with
its superb and Inspiring musical set
ting, rendered complete by a symph
ony orchestra, Its bewildering sound
nnd light and color effects will bo
presented at tho Orpheum Theater,
Ogden for ono week starting Sunday
March 2C, may bo generally covered
as' follows:
There aro twelvo reals of lvld, re
alistic spectacles which tell tho
story of a double romance, which ex
plains tho attltudo of tho North and
thi detenso of tho stubborn South
over tho slavo Issue, and which car
ry lone through scones of tho lone
crupl war, Its message to tho world
bolng Liberty and Union, ono and Inseparable.
Colonel Stoneman of tho North Is
In lovo with tho sister of Colonel
Cameron of tho South, nnd Colonel
Cameron Is infatuated with tho sister
of Colonel Stoneman. Theso romanc
es nro depicted before tho war and
tho views show how tho drawing of
lines and tho commencement of war
worked estrangement, distress nnd
hardship on tho young lovers and
niombcrs of their families.
Ilrnvo young men embrace their
mothers, sisters and sweethearts and
dcpnrt for army service, their emo
tions being depicted In their resolute
facos. The picture also bIiow patri
otic! women at homo sowing and knit
ting for tho soldiers.
Tho magic films reveal the Interi
ors of Northern nnd Southern homes.
Ono sees vnst armies mustered to
march away to war.
' In a twinkling tho sceno changes
and tho sun .shines brightly on n
snowy cotton field In tho bouUi, with
scores of negroes of all ages Pluck
ing tho white blossoms. Festlvo llttjo
plcaplnntcs caper about and at night
fallncablix quarters singing, nnd
dancing aro Indulged In by tho slaves.
Bondago Is visualized with Its sor
rows and its Joys. As tho wnr pro
gresses great battles aro fought and
tho thrilling action from rlflo flro
to cavalry clashes and artillery duel
la doplcted ln pictorial fon as truo
to Hfo as' It Is possible- for human
agency to stimulate
Scenes aro unfolded In which fully
18,000 soldiers nnd 3000 cavalry tho
largest theatrical army over assem
bled aro active In tho performance
, of tho good and bud deeds of war-
faro. Ono sees a bayonet chargo with
a quiver of oxcltcmcnt and closes
his eyes at tho sight of tho dying
and dead. Ambulance drivers arrlvo
to carry away tho fallen and hospi
tals throw doors open to recelvo the
Injured. Gentlo nurses lilt from cot
to cot to mlnUter to tho wants of
tho patients.
Historic scenes nro depleted with
realistic effect, ranglne from battlo
engagements, such as tho battlo of
Gettysburg, tho siege of Petersburg,
Sherman's march to tho sea and tho
fall of Atlanta, to evcntB In Wash
ington. In tho pictures General Robert E.
Leo strides forth to clasp tho hand
of General U. S. Grant, his conquer
or at Appomatox. Another historical
cent of lasting Impresslvcncss Is
tho assassination of President Abra
ham Lincoln, presented as accurately
as tho details aro remembered by eye
witnesses and ns exact reproduction
of tho play houso In which the mar
tyred presldont lost his Hfo.
Penco is exemplified In a brilliant
lj Impresslvo pageant ami tho pic
torlal story continues with tho for
tunes of tho reunited lovers nnd this
troubles experienced In tho South ov
er tho nbuso of political power vost
ed In tho Imanclpated negroes. Mob
vlolonco and outlawry aro depicted,
followed by spectacular views of tho
Ku Klux Klansmcn who organized
secretly to control tho negroes thru
their suporstltlous fears. Tho Klans
men woro fearless night riders and
thoy woro white shrouds. Acts of
vengeanco woro perpetrated under
tho cover of darkness and tho pic
tures show clearly why such oxtrcmo
measures wero necessary for tho con
tinuance of Uw and ordor.
In point of IntoreBt tho Klansmon
spectnclos rival tho war aspects of
