A .communication which. Mr. Tenney

Dear sir: By " Instruction of our

The text of the letter follows:. .

' Dear Sir: Now that the Carnival is
over, . may be that you are. prepared
to devote youi energies to the solution
of problems which have been brought
very prominently to the tore during
the paat few weeks. One of these is
hotel accommodations for the large
inimber of tourists who are. attracted
litre primarily, we suppose, by ths
Carnival itself. In a recent letter fiom
Capt Matson, ho writes as follows:
"It seems to -' me as though
something should be done with th

plentiful now, and I think that

connection therewith. The ques
