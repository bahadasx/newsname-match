Former Secretary Garrison came to
Washington and called at the war de
partment for a conference with his
successor, Secretary Baker. Mr. Gar
rison offered his services to the ad
ministration in the emergency, and is
expected to remain to assist Mr.
Baker for the present, at least.
No orders have been issued to the
navy, but it was considered probable
N that some of the Atlantic fleet might
be placed in Mexican waters to be
near if Americans in coast towns
were endangered by anti-American
demonstrations.
The government is reluctant to
make any naval demonstration that
might be construed as against Gen.
Carranza.
Some officials suggest offering a re
ward for Villa's capture, but it was
decided at once that the United States
had better send troops to catch him.
Representative Miller (Republican)
l- of Wisconsin told the House he ques
tioned whether the Villa raiders could
simply be regarded as marauders and
whether the attack on Columbus did
not assume proportions of almost a
national incursion.
"Does the nature of the offense de
pend at all," interjected Representa
tive Slayden of Texas, "on whether
d there were 300 or 3,000 of these ma
rauding savage Indians under the
- chieftainship, presumably, of the
g greatest murderer known to the whole
country? Is it not equal inhdignity to
. the United States whether there were
300 or 3,000?"
Representative Slayden etpressed
"indignation and horror at this great
international crime."
"The conditions are such," he ex
B plained, "that it is impossible to get
definite information as to the number
of bandits that were in this band.
B Conditions in Mexico are very pecu
D liar. Loyalty fluctuates. It goes from
one side to the other, and whether
6 they be Carranza thieves and murder
ers or Villa thieves and murderers
makes no difference.
"Most of the people there dislike
the people of the United States, and
the dislike of these ignorant Indians
who are encouraged to cultivate their
I prejudice is such that they may cheer
fully cut each other's throats on occa- I
sion they will stop that work, how- I
ever much it is gratifying to their
taste, to indulge in the more delect
able pastime of cutting American 1
throats, and it does not make any par- I
tide of difference whose uniforms
they wear."

a- Requests of Col. Herbert Slocum,
aer commanding the Thirteenth Cavalry
here, and of Major Tompkins to be aln
he lowed to renew the pursuit with a
le larger force, were denied, pending the
to organization of the large expedition.
e Reports from Mexican sources say
that Villa apparently is carrying out
ed a plan to elude pursuit by breaking up
t his forces into small bands and hiding
among the mountains. Some of his
,x- forces are reported approaching the
bet Sonora state border. Others are said
er to be making their way southward
id. and southeastward toward the moun
tains of the San Geronimo district,
from which Villa started March 1 with
er the announced intention of invading
r_ the United States.
e Military men. here believe that when
Villa is found and pushed- on both
k sides he will not stand ahd fight.

STATE GOVERNMENT ENTERED
INTO AGREEMENT WITH CAR
RANZA TO ENTER U. 8.
CO-OPERATION IS EXPECTED
Plans for Troop Movements Have
Gone Ahead Without Regard to Di
plomatic Exchange-To Pre
vent Intervention.
Washington.-The United States
government entered into a formal
agreement with the Carranza govern
ment under which American troops
will cross the border to hunt down
Villa and his bandits with the expec
tation of hearty co-operation from the
Carranza forces.
Secretary Lansing made public a
note accepting General Carranza's pro
posal for a reciprocal arrangement be
tween the two governments and an
nouncing that the Upited States con
siders this arrangement now in force
and binding upon both parties. Plans
for the troop movements have gone
ahead without regard to the diplo
matic exchanges.
Mr. Lansing also made public a
statement issued in the name of Pres
ident Wilson, reiterating that every
step being taken by the administra
tion is based on the deliberate inten
tion to preclude the possibility of
armed intervention in Mexico.
This is the text of the reply to Gen
eral Carranza's proposal sent to Amer
clan Consul Silliman:
"The government of the United
States has received the courteous
note of Senor Acuna and has read with
satisfaction his suggestion for recpiro
cal privileges to the American and
Mexican authorities in the pursuit and
apprehension of outlaws who infest
their respective territories lying
along the international ooundary and
who are a constant menace to the
lives and property of residents of that
region. " " "
"The government of the United
States understands that in view of its
agreement to this reciprocal arrange
ment proposed by the de facto gov
ernment, the arrangement is now comn.
Dlete and in force and the reciprocal
privilege thereunder may accordingly
be exercised by either government
without further interchange of views.
"It is a matter of sincere gratifica
tion to the government of the United
States that the de facto government
of Mexico has evinced so cordial and
friendly a spirit of co-operation in the
efforts of the authorities of the United
States to apprehend and punish the
bands of outlaws who seek refuge be
yond the international boundary in the
erroneous belief that the constituted
authorities will resent any pursuit
across the boundary by the forces of
the government whose citizens have
suffered by the crimes of the fugi
tives. * * ,
