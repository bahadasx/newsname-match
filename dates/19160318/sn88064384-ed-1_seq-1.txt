Chalmers Moves oft' Swiftly and Sweetly—CVeful of Every Drop of Fuel
Dixieland beholds the arrival of the magnificent
new 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers at an hour when her cotton,
steel textile and munitions industries are sending tidal
waves of prosperity through the South.
The cream of Chalmers production has hitherto
» been absorbed* by the North. Most of the South had
to go without.
Vastly enlarged facilities of production which usher
in the 3400 r p. m. Chalmers have changed all that
This is the car that performs.
Almost superhuman engineering achievements have
wrung from her small, compact, high-speed motor the
, sought-for secret of supreme acceleration.
This energetic engine spins at the uncanny rate of
mO revolutions per minute.
^ . The _swift, silent, aluminum-hinged breathing of
vus engine is what makes the car perform.
, Tiw more explosions per minute and the greater
tnc manner of revolutions of the motor, the lesser
amount of heat is lost through the cooling jacket.
Ad heat is power.
A small engine—a small area in which heat can be
thrown away by radiation—a short, cooling process

hills on high." You overcome most of the adversi
ties of the road without change of gear.
Once you put your foot on the accelerator button
and lay hold of the steering wheel, you'll tee I that
here is the car you must own.
That's why I say: Bring your check-book when y rr x
come for a ride in the 3400 r. p. in. Chalmers,
Raw materials of every sort are growing scarcer
every day. This condition may improve. But to he on
the sine of absolute safety record your order now when
you are sure of delivery with but slight, if any,
delay. ' #->' i
