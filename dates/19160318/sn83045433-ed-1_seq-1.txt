AWAIT BERLIN
SUn DEBATE
'Officials Here Believe Ger
many Will Abide by Deci
sion of Reichstag.
KAISER AND MILITARY PARTY
EXPECTED TO MOLD OPINION
Washington Eagerly Looks Forward
to Discussion of Controversy in
Teuton Chamber.
Tie news from Berlin that the sub
marine controversy with the United
States is to be threshed out next week
in the Iteichstag overshadowed every
other phase of the submarine issue in
oficl circles today.
It is fu!ly beliesed that Germany
will yield to or defy the United States
according to the Reistag's decision. To
what extent this decision will be
moulded by the Kaiser and the mill
tary party remains a matt.r of the
most animated diplomatic discussion.
though the consensus of well-inform
ed opinion Is that the Kaiser's wishes
will dominate the situation.
In support of this prediction diplo
rmat. say that even in times of peace
rh military party has invariably pre
vailed in the Reichstag whenever any
question affecting the safety of the
empire was at stake.
No secret is made of the fact that
the British have to a great extent
bottled up Von Tirpifs's rsiderp sol
there has 'been leen disapped..i in
Berlin over the fact that no single
transport carrying troops or suppUss
to and from France has been inter
ferred with by German submarines.
The German newspapers predicted
something over a year ago that subma
ories would raise havoc with this trans
port service and completely isolate Eng
land and France. But the construction
of a remarkably contrived boom across
the channel has acted like a mosquito
netting. and the only submarines that
attempted to pass through were inter
cepted as soon as they ran foul of the
special electrical contrivances which are
i t.here to gI e the alarm.
The average German feels that the
United States government has about as
much tight to tell Germany how to con
duct her submarine warfare as the Ger
man -mperor has to choose the next
Presidential candidates here.
The idea. it is explained, appears so
preposterous to Germans that even the
usuallv well-mformed editors of Berlin
newspapeis ciedit reports that President
Wilson and Great Britain have formed a
I ecret alliance.

"tave your senior sergeant in charge

on your return."
T~his conversation occurred at mid
night. An hour later the German patrol
had been annihilated and the picket re
turned, carrying a lieutenant motally
wounded. The post commander sprang
to the telephone.
"Hello! The coup succeeded,~E5ut Lieut.
-- is dying. Can you send a doctor'"
An exclamation of grief came from the
other end of the line. There was a pause,
thn anipassive voice was heard say
"Nvrmind the doctor. Run Immedi
ately to the dugouts. The Gerroans are
about to attack. I am sending you three
platoons of re-enforcemeiits."
A pause ensued -and then the same
voice resumed In broken tones:

Berlin Contends That Docu

COPIES CAPTURED BY GERMANS
Von Bernstorf Argues That British
Ships Are Armed for Ofense and
Do Not Deserve Protection.
The State Department made public yes
terday copies of the "secret orders"
which the German government claims
were given by the British admiralty to
British sailing masters, instructing the*
to attack German submarines.
The orders were communicated to the
department by Count von Bernstorff, the
German Ambassador, in support of his
government's contention that British
armed passenger or merchant ships are
armed for oRense, and therefore not en
titled to the special protection accorded
to unarmed merchantmen.
Found on Steamer.
The "secret orders," marked "confnden
tial" and bearing the warning that they
must under no circumstances be allowed
to fall into the hands of the enemy, are
alleged to have been found on the Eng
lish steamer Woodfield, captured by the
Germans.
The German government contends that
they have a direct and important bear
ing on the question of armed merchant
ships and show that all British armed
ships are playing the role of wartships.
The point is emphasised by Germany
that President Wilson's claim for im
qpgnity for ships "armed for defeuse

No comment was made at the State De
partmant with reference to the German
communication. Acting Secretary of State
Polk explained that the Uilted States
was simply making public a communica
tion It had received from Berlin. What
ever bearing it will have on the "armed
ship Issue" or the submarine controversy
with-the central powers Is not disclosed.
No Longer Are in Efect.
At the British Embassy it was said that
the admiralty alone would be in a posi
tion to refute or discuss the alleged
"secret orders." Officials in touch with
the British government understand, how
ever. that these admirality orders applied
to a time when German submarines were
indiscriminately attacking all passenger

Although the State Dcpartnent yester

show that there was little apparent hos

the situation at Tampico, on the east

there is considerable anti-American feel
