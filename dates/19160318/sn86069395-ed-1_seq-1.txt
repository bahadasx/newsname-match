IS UPWARD
In Tobacco Prices This Week
With Sales Falling
Off.
BIGGEST RUSH IS NOW OVER
Receipts Fall Under A Million
Pounds, First Time For
Several Weeks.
There was a considerable falling off
in tobacco sales this week, due to
the bad weather and the further fact
that the roads are almost impassable
where there are no pikes.
The supply also is growing less un
der the deliveries of the last six weeks,
averaging more than a million a week.
Prices showed a perceptible in
crease, averaging 29 cents above the
season's average and well above the
dark tobacco average of 5.38 for the
0 itirc state during February.
On the whole, conditions are more
favorable in every way.

HE IS HIDING IN THE HILLS
Washington Has No News and
Does Not Expect Any Soon
Mexico Generally Quiet.
Washington, March 17. An im
penetrable wall of secrecy surround
ed -tonight the movement of troops
beyond the Mexican border. So far
as official Washington .was advised,
the columns virtually might have van
ished into thin air when they crossed
the international boundary yesterday
in pursuit of Villa. Even the commander-in-chief,
President Wilson,
did not know where Gen. Pershing's
men were.
Secretary Baker received virtually
nb reports from Gen. Funston dealing
with events beyond the borders. Late
today he said he did not know wheth
er troops had proceeded southward
from their first bivouac on Mexican
soil last night. Not a single dispatch
from the border was made public
during the day except one reporting
the death of Lieut. Zell, Eleventh
cavalry, at the Columbus hospital,
where he took his own life in a fit of
despondency.
VILLA FAR TO THE SOUTH.
Army officials were convinced that
more important developments were
to be expected for several days. It
seemed fplain from theVUay's accumu
lation of rumors that-Villa was far to
the south of his American pursuers
The war department would not di
vulgo any details of the number ,of
troops across the border or of the
regiments sent. Press advices, how
ever, showed that infantry accom
panied the cavalry and artillery out
of Columbus in the main column.
That means slow progress across the
desert. It will take days, it is said,
to cover the distance to Galsna, .the
town where Villa, was reported un
officially to have been seen.
American consuls in Mexico so far
have been able to give little aid to the
troops, although all are on watch for
information that might indicate the
bandit's movements. Consular ad
vices today continued to report gen
erally quiet conditions.. Officials dis
played some concern over the situation
in the Tampico district, however,
where there were signs of unrest.
KENTUCKY SENT TO VERA CRUZ
The battleship Kentucky was or
dered back to Vera Cruz from New
Orleans, Secretary Daniels explaining
that naval vessels now on the coast
did not have radio equipment power
ful enough to insure uninterrupted
communication with Washington.
With the Kentucky at Vera Cruz, re
ports from smaller vessels along the
coast can be quickly relayed to Key
West and Arlington.

"The United States expeditionary
force, consisting of about 4,000 men
under Gen. Pershing, crossed the
Mexican border at noon Wednesday
and began the campaign which, it has
been ordered, must end in the exter
mination of Villa. Co-operation or
dered officially by Carranza through
his Minister of War, Gen. Obregon,
was shown by the first defacto troops
which the Americans encountered.
Troops from other posts to take the
place of those sent into Mexico
reached the border and according to

ried. At an early hour yesterday morn
ing John B. Russell, a prominent at
torney, committed suicide at the:
home of his father, on South Main i
street. He had not been well for
several days but was down in town
in the early part o the evening and
after going home sat in his father's
room until 9 o'clock, chatting as usu
al. Noting the time, he remarked
that it was his father's bed time and
got up and went upstairs to his own
room.
About 6 o'clock yesterday morning
his father heard him walking about
and arose and unlocked a door to ad
mit the cook to the house and went
back to bed as was. his custom.
Shortly afterwards a pistol shot was j
heard in the cellar. Getting up to
investigate Mr. Russell heard a groan
in the cellar and neighbors were
hastily" called. Messrs. J. A. Brown
ing and Harry Yost were the first to
reach the scene. Mr. Russell was
found dead in the cellar, to which he
had gone to take his life. Using a
shotgun he had sat down on the floor,
placed the gun between his legs and
shot himself in the mouth, tearing
away all of the left side of his face
and skull and making a horrible
wound that produced almost instant
death.
Mr. Russell was the oldest son of
Mr. Jas. D. Russell. He and his
father lived alone in the large Rus
sell home. His mother died several
years ago. A brother, Jas. D. Rus
sell, Jr., lives at dishing, Okla., and
a sister, Mrs. A. P. Crockett, at
Oklahoma City. He was 41 years of
age and had for nearly 21 years been
a member of the Hopkinsville bar,
until quite recently the junior mem
ber of the firm of Downer & Russell.
He was a fine lawyer, well equipped,
studious and with a preference for
office practice. He v.-.s :he local at

CLEAR FOR
DEFENSE PLANS
House May Pass By To-night
: the Bill to Increase the
Aimy.
"GIVES TEN HOURS TO DEBATE
Senate Hurrying Its Program
and Army Act May Be Up
to President in Month.
Washington, March 17. Sweeping
aside intervening issues, congress has
set the stage for prompt action on the
defense measures urgently pressed
by President Wilson since the session
began.
The house voted unanimously for a
special rule under which the army in
crease bill will be taken up today
with passage by Saturday night in
prospect. A ten-hour limit for gen
eral debate was fixed, despite the fact
that the bill is the most far-reaching
military measure ever favorably re
ported to the body.
The senate military committee com
pleted its final review of the senate
army increase bill and it is in the
hands of the printer. Senator Cham
berlain, with administration influence
tfehind him, will insist that it will be
taken up promptly, displacing the
water power bill now under consid
eration unless the latter reaches a
vote in a few days.
The senate measure in some re
spects proposes an even more drastic
change in military policy than is pro
vided in the house bill.
MAY BE A LAW WITHIN MONTH.
Indications are that the joint con
ference committee which will adjust
the two bills and frame the final meas
ure will be at work within three
weeks. The legislative framework
of the army increase project may be
an accomplished fact within another
month.

K-T. FAIR
CIRCUIT
Important Step Taken To Bene
fit Western Kentucky
Fairs.
PENNYROYAL FAIR AUGUST 27
President Cowherd Enthusiastic
Over Prospects For This
Year.
S. L. COWHERD.
President S. L. Cowherd, of the
Pennyroyal Fair Co., makes the im
portant announcement that the fair
this year will be held a month earlier,
or the last week in August. The
definite dates are from Aug. 27 to
Sept. 2.
This decision was reached at a
meeting held at Guthrie when the
K.-T. fair circuit was formed with
seven towns included. According to
the schedule they formally adopted at
that meeting the fairs will be held as
follows:
Adairville Week of July 23-29.
Springfield Week of July 30 to
August 5. '
Gallatin Week of August 6-12.
Franklin Week of August 13-19.
Elkton Week of August 20-26.
Hopkinsville Week of August 27
to September 2.
Bowling Green Week Sept. 3-9.
These dates are regarded as alto
gether suitable in each town. Be
ginning with Adairville the various
attractions, concessions and exhibits
could go from one fair to another
without long or costly jumps and
would be assured in this way of 7
continuous weeks of profitable busi
ness. The setting of the dates ear
lier in the year is also expected to in
sure better weather for all the fairs.
The state fair at Louisville will be
held this year during the week of
September 11-17 so the K.-T. circuit
schedule works right up to this.
The meeting at Guthrie was very
enthusiastic and was attended by C.
E. Gill and B. ,L. Penick, of Elkton;
C. II. Smith, of Bowling Green, G. H.
Jackson and J. A. Crowdus, of Frank
lin; and B. P. Eubanks, Holland Gar
nett and S. L. Cowherd, of Christian
county.
When it came to choosing officers
C E. Gill was elected as president
and Holland Garnett was made sec
tary and treasurer. The committee
to draft bylaws and rules was com
posed of S. L. Cowherd, C. II. Smith,
B. L. Penick and J. A. Crowdus.
The committee reported and the by
laws and rules were formally adopt
ed. In these the object of the fair
circuit is to "increase the interest in
better livestock and general farm and
family products."

FRENCH STILL
HOLD FIRM
Verdun Defenses Have So Far
Proven Impregnable
Barrier.
MORE GERMAN SACRIFICES
Assault With Huge Effectives on
Le Mort Homme Repulsed
With Great Losses.
London, March 17. Repulse at tho
hands of the French again has been
the net result of a German infantry
attack launched with huge effectives
after a heavy bombardment against
French positions at Le More Homme,
northwest of Verdun. The Germans,
who attacked in serried masses, were
driven eastward toward the Bois des
Corbeaux, where the French guns in
flicted heavy casualties on them.
Around Douaumont and the village
ofVauxthe big guns are operating
with redoubled violence, while south
ward in the Wa'vrc the artillery
duels in the Mouse hills continue.
In the Argonne forest the French
guns are stiil shelling the German po
sitions northwest of the road from
Varenens and German batteries near
? ..I
monuuueon.
The latest German official communi
cation, making reference to French
attempts to "dispute our possession
of the height of Le More Homme,"
has brought forth a statement from
the French embassy at Washington
that the Germans never have gained
a footing on the hill, which the
French still hold.
Only engagements between patrols
have taken place on the Russian
front.
The Italians continue strongly on
the offensive against the Austrians
on the Isonzp front, especially on the
Podgora heights sector and southwest
of San Martino. On Podgora tho
Italians entered the Austrian lines
but, according to Vienna, were re
pulsed in vicious hand-to-hand fight
ing.
Both Austrians and Italians lay
claim to successes around San Mar
tino. The Austrians assert that an
Italian attacks in this sector failed and
that the Italians left numerous dead
on the field.
The Italian official statement de
clares that after artillery and mus
ketry preparations the Austrians
launched two strong attacks and suc
ceeded in reaching the edge of the
trenches taken from them recently
but were on each occasion repulsed,
leaving the ground covered with
dead."
Premier Asquith and other officeis
were criticised at a large meeting in
London of married men who have
attested for service in the army.
Speakers declared there were still
2,000,000 men available and that tho
married men would refuse to serve
until Premier Asquith redeemed his
pledge to bring out the single men be
fore the others were called to tho
colors.
The feeling of the meeting was in
tensified by the reading of a letter
from Mr. Asquith declining to receive
a deputation representing tho married
men on the ground that this was a
subject to be dealt with by parlia
ment. The meeting adopted by acclama
tion resolutions demanding that all
proclamations calling up married men.
be withdrawn.
