To the Chairman and Members

mittee, \ew Iberia, La.
(icntlemen It is with regret'
that I have to ask you to permit
me to withdraw my name as a
candidate for Senator for this the
Pith Senatorial District.
Careful and mature considéra
tion of the matter, however, leads
me to the conclusion that my
professional duties have prior
claims on me which could not be
fulfilled should I be elected to
the office to which I would gladly
aspire were conditions different,
There are many questions of
public good to he considered by
the next Legislature, amongst
which are several of vital interest
to me.
I assure, you Gentlemen, that
it would be a pleasure for me to
serve tny District and my State,
♦o labor in their interest with all
the earnestness and zeal of which
1 am possessed and to help secure
the enactment of such laws as
would result in the advancement
of the public welfare.
Since, however, the indulgence
of this pleasure is denied me. and
I must continue in the service
duty imposes; may I he permitted
to suggest that my name be sub
stituted by that of Mr Veiitress
i
•T. Smith. None can s**rve you j
better than he; energetic, well
informc ( j and forceful. Mr. Smith j
could not fut forge his way to j
the front from the verv start, j
and there not only accomplish
much good, but also reflect honor i
IfOOf
upon t Ji)■ l istricf which
him as its representative.
In cop H us!o:i I wish to thank
you. tîcntleincii of the Comm't
tee. and all of my oth r Democra
tic friends who sought to copfrr
this honor upon me. and to sav.
that although denied the
i!eg« of serving vo l in such ca
pacitv, that I am in no other wav
forbidden to serve my party to
the fullest of my ability, for all
Democratic nominees. State Dis

Very truly yours.
