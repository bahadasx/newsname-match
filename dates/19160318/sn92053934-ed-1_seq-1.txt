Full Cooperation of Mexican
Government as Agreed
Seems Unreliable.
RESTRICT AMERICANS
United States Troopers Will
Not Be Allowed to En
, ter Mexico Cities.
San Antonio, Texas, March 18. The
reported refusal of General Gavlra to
permit the American troops pursuing
Francisco Villa In Mexico to enter the
town of Casas Grandes, revived doubt
at Fort Sam Houston today of the full
cooperation of the de facto govern
ment's force. The announcement of
General Gavira, commandant at
Juarez, that the United States troops
had arrived at most at the outskirts
of Casas Grandes and planned to en
ter during the night was the first news
received by General .Funston that the
punitive forces had gone that far
south. It was known that Colonel
Dodd was pushing his column but to
have reached Casas Grandes last night
indicated averages of about thirty
miles a day.
Pershing's Intentions Unknown.
What General Pershing intended to
do in answer to the refusal of the Mex
ican commander to allow him to enter
or to pass through Casas Grandes was
not known at General Funston's head
quarters, but It was not regarded as
probable that he-would make an Issue
of the point. Here, it was believed, the
Americans would be content to remain
beyond the city limits of the town un
jes the presence of his troops within
She town for the protection of the
Americans living there seemed advis
able.
The last reports from General Persh
ing told of no clashes with Mexicans
and did not indicate the exact location
of Villa, It Is believed he is in the
mountains of the Gaianea district but
that he will continue Js shifting flight
without offering real resistance per
haps for many days.
To Occupy no Towns.
Washington, March 18. American
troops pursuing Villa and his bandits
have no intention and no orders to oc
cupy any cities or towns during their
march into Mexico.
This was stated at the White house
and war department today after the
receipt of a report that General Ga
vira, the Carranza commander at
Juarez had given notice that General
Pershing's troops would not be allow
ed to occupy Casas Grandes or other
towns.
It was declared by administration
officials that the pursuit of Villa, be
ing entirely a punitive expedition, had
none of the characteristics of an in
vasion and that there was no object In
occupying towns or cities, because the
American troops will keep constantly
on the move.
Officials said today that the situa
tion at Tampico where uneasiness is
said to exist among Americans and
other foreigners had no bearing on the
pursuit of Villa
Reports received at both the war
and state departments today con;
tlnued to be optimistic.
General Gavira, Carranza command
er at Juarez, in a statement given out
today to The Associated Press, de
clared that the crisis In the relations
between the United States and Mexico
was past and that there was no further
need to fear trouble.

committee Informed the house today
when debate on the measure was re
sumed under the ten hour rule.

mendations of his message. It goes a
little farther."

not contain the continental army pro

of Casas Grandes. They arrived in the
night Through Colonia Dublan runs
the road to the Galeana district, 25
miles southeast, where Villa was last
definitely reported.

lonia Dublan dispelled fears of any
disputes with constitutionalist authori
ties over what position the American
troops should occupy at Casas Grandes.

news that the Americans were near.

was believed to have been reached to
day with the arrival of the advance
corps of the expeditionary force at

which the column has moved is main
tained, the American soldiers should
be In Villa territory before nightfall.
Casas Grandes is 25 miles from the
border of the, district of Guerrero, the
bandit chiefs native heath. There has
been no reliable report as to the ex
act whereabouts of Villa but it is con
sidered fairly certain that he has tak
en refuge In the fastneses of the
mighty Sierra Madres, one of the wild
est and most inaccessible regions in
all Mexico. The people of Guerrero are
said to be fanatical followers of the
fugitive and he can rely on them for
food, recruits and Information as to
the movements of his pursuers. The
task of the United States force will
have really begun when they reach the
foothills of the Sierrr.s.

troops in the vicinity of Casas Grandes
was greeted along the border with a
sigh of relief, In as far as the fate of
the GOO American Mormons at Colonia
Dublan and Colonia Morelo3 Is con
cerned. The soldiers are already
south of these settlements and so all
fears for the safety of the colonists
have been removed.

CHANGE OF PEACE
LOST SAYS BERLIN

Grace" is Over and Energies Are
To Be Doubled.
Berlin, March 18. Germany's ene
mies, by not taking sdvantage of the
announcement of Chancellor von Beth-mann-Hollweg
on Dec. 9 that Germany
would consider peace proposals when
even her foes are willing to ask terms,

from a leading article in the tmi-of-flciaj.
Lokal Anzelgcr in which it is de
clared flatly the time; has now comVto
carry out the chancellor's warning
that if the enemies of this country did
not ask for peace within a reasonable
time they would have to pay more
dearly for it.
"Even then the chancellor left no
doubt that, in so far as his honorable
wish to avoid further senseless blood
letting should prove futile,we are de
termined to double our energies in or
der to open the blindest of our ene
mies' eyes," says the article.

OF SUBWARFARE
National Liberty Party at German
Reichstag Urges That Snbsea
Weapon Go Unrestricted.
Berlin, March 18. The national lib
erty party has introduced a measure in
the reichstag saying that inasmuch as
Great Britain has taken measures to
Impede the providing of Germany with
food supplies and raw material, so as
to compel Germany to submit through
hunger, for which purpose Great Brit
ain brutally violates international law
and that as Germany is able through
unlimited and unrestrained submarine
warfare to make it extraordinarily dif
ficult for the British nation to obtain
sufficient supplies of food and raw
materials, the Imperial chancellor is
required to enter into no arrange
ments with other countries which
would hinder Germany in the unlimit
ed use of the submarine weapon.
