tkOo argent for eastern South Carolina,
Wtjs?the only other speaker. Dr.
Ldag was most impressive In his re
sharks and was askeil quite a number
at qoestions as to thu proposed pack
lag house and Its establishment, al?
though he said he did not know much
c*f working* of packing houses, but was
Only speaking- from a standpoint of
a solution of the problems of market?
ing Uve stock and grain.
Mr. McFadden. when Introduced,
merely mentioned the fact of his hav?
ing: been la attendance upon the con
fHoaoes held at various schools In the
oojanty during the past week and ex
. jssed hie delight at the feelings of
mutual dependance and sympathy be?
tween the business men and the agri?
cultural classes. He considered It tho
doty of the business men to provide
markets for the products of the farm.
When the farmer raised these pro?
ducts. He said that he was glad to
note the interest displayed by tho
Chamber of Commerce In aiding the
farmers In solving their problems and
hoped they would continue their
work In thle lino, ss It was on the
fight track.
Dr. W. W. Long * tar ted out by tell?
ing his auditors th?.t his whole fam?
ily were farmers and thst his whole
life had been devoted to promoting
agriculture. He said that he knew,
however, that not all the virtues were
possessed by the farmers and not all
the vices were possessed by the
business men, for he had known
business men to Irr pose on farmers
snd had known of farmers practising
deceptions on business men. He con?
demned sny personu who sought to
array the two agalnttt each othor.
Up to a short while ago there had
never been any logtilatlon in the In
tercet of the farmer, and the finances
of the country had been conducted In
a manner Injurious to the farmers
until the present administration went
In. The work of the commercial or?
ganisations had up to a short time
ago been to Induce outside manufac?
turing Industries to come In, but now
It was turning into the right channol.
the development of the agricultural
back country, upon which the life of
the town depended. "Every town In
Soeih Carolina." stated Dr. Long In
his most Impressive style. " has its
back country, as Its most Important
asset, for without tils back country
Iand Its products, the town would be
ruined." He said that diversification
of farming was no new doctrine, it
had been preached from the earliest
history of tho State. Before the War
Between States there had been more
cattle, hogs and every form of live
stock In the State than at present, ex?
cept the mole, of which there were
more. now. "The reasons that diver?
sification has not been more generally
practised," said Dr. Long, "is that
thsrs hae been no markets for the
I diversified products of the farm.
There must be a market for them and
the business men should provide this
market for the farmers did not have
the proper financial backing and con?
nections which the buslnete men had,
and could not establish these neces?
sary markets for themselves.
. "Now I will give you the solution
to the problems of marketing grains
and live stock. It is the establishment
of a packing house, for no sensible
farmer will want to sell Ids grain, if
he can find a market fo - his live
stock and convert it into meat."
Dr. Long at this point went into
detailn as to the establishment of the
creameries in the State, of which
there were four, he said. These had
been mart cd small and Clemson Col
lego had insisted that they should a p?
point the men to operate them. The
I business men who had taken stock In
.them were told that they must be sat?
isfied with eight per cent, interest on
.their money. The enterprise was not
an investment for them, but the plac?
ing of their monsy In a plant for
I the public benefit, and it was only as
[such toat they would receive ' the
beneftt f^b4e|**jm*y we
assured eight per Cent, interest on
'their stock. Whatever money more
than taat woo hoade was given to
the farmers to encourage them to
work up their dairy business All of
the creameries had proven successful
under the skillful guidance which the
demonstration department had pro?
vided. He said that recently a
ready market has been found for the
products turned out by the creameries
and at the present rate of increase, in
six years S?rth Carolina would pro?
vide every bit of the butter it used.
The establishment of the packing
house would be on the same plan. It
would requiro a capital of 150,000 and
the money would not be put into the
plant as an Investment, but it must
be given as a publlo benefit, for it
would bring increased prosperity to
the community. He could not prom
lso any dividends the first year, but
after that he could promise eight per
cent dividends. The money paid for
the live stock would go back to the
community where the stock came
from and the enterprise would there?
fore benefit every community within
a radius of many miles which took
advantage of the opportunity it af?
forded.
At thin point Mr. Long stated that
he did not know yet whether there
were sufficient hogs In the Pee Dee
section of the State to warant the
establishment of a packing plant here.
One would be established at Oreen
villo and If there were sufficient swine
he wantel one In the Poe Dee section.
He stated that he had sent out cards
to all of the demonstration agents in
the State to find out the number of
hogs raised last year, tb ' ber for
home consumption and for sale, and
the number which would be raised
this year. In about two weeks this
information would be on hand and
he would know how to proceed fur?
ther In the matter. Ho atatod that
If only one was established, It would
prove of xreat bencgt to the State, as
the rate on live stock In South Caro?
lina was i he cheapest of any State in
the union. There were comparative?
ly few farmers, Mr. Long stated, who
knew what a marketable hog was, and
the live s ock Industry would have to
be gradually worked up. If tho pack?
ing house was established it would be
In a small way at first and gradually
Increased as tho live stock Industry
was built up.
Mr. Long stated that only those
persons who had visited the sections
which had established packing houses
could realise the difference in agri?
culture which they had brought about.
He advised a visit of a committee of

GERMANY ANXIOUS TO PREVENT
TROUBLE AS RESULT OF
SILIUS CASE.
Represented as Thinking Reports In?
accurate and Maintaining That Such
Attacks Would be Exceeding In^
structlons to its Submarine Com?
manders.
Washington, March 14.?Unofficial
i advices received here today indicate j
that Germany will make complete
amends to the United States if it is
found that a German submarine tor?
pedoed the Norwegian bark Sillus,
from which seven Americans were
rescued in Havre roads.
The German government is repre?
sented here aa believing that a tor?
pedo was not responsible for the loss
of the bark and that any commander
who attacks a neutra l ship such as the
Sillus without warning would be ex?
ceeding his instructions.
The sinking of the Sillus has been
the cause of much concern here be?
cause American Cor.sul Osbome at
Havre reported that the ship was tor?
pedoed without warning. His report
was based on statements of American
I survivors. Officials are inclined to en?
tertain the possibility that the ship
might have struck a mine, but the
case is being Investigated further.
Today the state department receiv?
ed another report from Consul Os?
bome which failed to mention the
cause of the sinking, merely saying
the vessel was unarmed, carried a car?
go of grain and no passengers. Of
the crew of 17 members only three
perished. Among the victims was the
captain, a Norwegian. He also re?
ported the names of four of the sev?
en Americans aboard the ship. These
were: John Hartman, Philadelphia;
i "Daniel Nobal, John Van Galen and
[Henry Monahan, addressee not given,
Hartman is in a hospital with a
fractured hip. The other three are
en route to New York aboard tho
steamer Texandrier, due to arrive
there April 1.

ton.
business men to Moultrie, Ga., or Tal
ladegha, Ala., where pUnts had been
established to see the changes which
had been brought.
"You have heard of preparedness
for the past year now," stated the
speaker. "You must prepare for the
coming of the boll weevil. I have
seen cities and communities ruined by
Its advent, places which had been
warned, but would not act on the ad?
vice. I have seen land which sold at
fifty dollars an acre offered for five
dollars, and a purchaser could not be
found. The boll weevil is now only
146 miles from the South Carolina
line and it will be here soon, and it is
coming to stay. I have seen individ?
uals prepare, but I have never seen a
community prepare, although it was
warned. Live stock Is your only sal?
vation and I beg of you to be prepar?
ed."
In his remarks In answer to ques?
tions Dr. Long stated that he thought
that neighboring communities should
come Into the proposition, as It would
prove a benefit to them, as well as to
Sumter. He said that all of the sur?
rounding towns should bo given an
opportunity of subscribing to tho $50,
000 stock of the packing plant, if it
was established here. Of course ho
could not say that they would sub?
scribe. He advised the appointment
of a committee to look Into the mat?
ter further and see if Sumter busi?
ness men were interested in the prop?
osition and would raise tho capital for
tho packing plant.
Dr. Long was given a vote of
thanks for his very Interesting and
instructive remarks.
Among thoae present at the meet?
ing besides Dr. Long and Mr. McFad
den were Mr. It, L. Baker, he.id of
the Boys* Corn and Pig Clubs in the
8tate, Mr. J. Frank Williams, county
demonstrator, and Mr. E. N. Welch,
Lee county demonstrator.
j LEVER PRESENTS MEASURE.
PART OP AGRICULTURAL PREP?
AREDNESS PROGRAMME.
South Carolina Congressman Points
to Dependence of Everything on
farming.
Washington, March 14.?Represen?
tative Lever today introduced his cot?
ton standards bill, which provides
for the establishment of uniform
standards of classification for cotton
and provides for the application, en?
forcement and use of such standards
In transactions in interstate and for?
eign commerce and provides for pro?
tection against the misuse of the
standards.
Standards of grades for cotton have
already been established and promul?
gated. This bill undertakes to en?
force these standards and sets up the
inachinery for proper grades and
classifying of cotton through licensed
graders that goes into interstate and
foreign commerce.
; "This bill," said Mr. Lever, " is one
of several which go to make up what
X am pleased to term the agricul?
tural end of the administration pre?
paredness programme. The other
bills included In this programme are
the reenactment of the cotton futures
tct to overcome the technical de?
cision of a New York federal judge
declaring the act unconstitutional,
the federal warehouse bill, which
will furnish a uniform warehouse re?
ceipt issued from federally super?
vised and bonded warehouses, the
train grades bill, providing for a
federal system of supervision of grain
grading, and the land mortage credit
bill, which undertakes to set up a
j comprehensive system of furnishing
cheaper credit for long terms on the
amortization plan of repayment
for farmers. This constitutes the
moat ambitious programme of legis?
lation in behalf of agriculture ever
proposed in any legislative body, but
complete preparedness can not exist
I unless it takes into consideration
agriculture and economic prepared?
ness as well as military and naval
preparedness. The fact is that the
Iwlti** kind of preparedness can not
* tkry and naval preparedness are nec?
essarily bedrocked upon agriculture
and economic preparedness."

FACULTY TO HANDLE HAZING.
University Student Body Drops Juris?
diction-?Formerly Under Honor
System.
Columbia March, 12.?Hating,
which has been under the honor sys?
tem at the University of South Caro?
lina, was again placed entirely under
faculty supervision by the student
body of the university yesterday
morning.
Several years ago the university stu?
dents requested the faculty to make
hazing a part of the honor system,
and as this was done, any hazing
charges were dealt with by the honor
syste i committee of the student body.
Yesterday's motion, which was car?
ried by a large majority, rescinds that
move of several years ago, and takes
hazing out of the honor committee's
jurisdiction. This means that all fu?
ture hazing charges against students
will be dealt with by the faculty alone.
