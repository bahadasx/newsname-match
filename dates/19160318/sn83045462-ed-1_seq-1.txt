sides were eager to know whether th?
bill had the full approval of the administration.
"I am authorized to state," Chairmar
Hay replied, "that the bill meets with
the approval of the President. It is his
Wll. It carries out the recommendations
of his message. It goes a little
farther."
Mr. Hay added that while the bill did
not contain the continental army provision
recommended by former Secretary
Garrison and approved by President
Wilson, the President was satisfied
that the proposed federalization ol
the National Guard would accomplish
the same purpose.
Voting- for President's Convictions.
"Then," said Mr. Moore, "gentlemen
voting for this bill will be voting for
the President's convictions."
"They will," Mr. Hay responded.

Kentucky, who opened the debate, said
the one principle upon which all

In supporting the increase Representative
Smith, democrat, of New York,
said the special act of Congress to obtain
men to cope with the Mexican
situation was sufficient argument for
improving the national defense.
Same Object Accomplished.
Representative Nicholls. democrat, of
South Carolina said the continental
army scheme had seemed impractical
to the committee, but the bill substituted
the National Guard for that proposal
and accomplished the same object
in a practical way.
"Army and civilian critics of the present
army and of the National Guard have
overshot their mark," Representative
Anthony, republican, or Kansas said.
"1 want to say that what army we have
today is the best in the world," he added.
"For its size no army in the world equals
it"
Hacked by the provisions of the bill
Representative Anthony said all the military
necessities of the nation would tx

CITATION OF INCIDENTS
IN SUPPORT OF CHARGES
1 Says Proposed Legislation in District
Is Due to Attempt to Nullify
Excise Law.
5 Making the direct charge that
, liquor interests already have ber
gun to attempt to coerce and in
timidate residents of Washington
- into supporting a demand for a
- referendum of the prohibition
question to the people of the Disr
trict. Senator Jones of Washing;
ton in the Senate today spoke in
; opposition to the referendum.
; He charged, too, that the next
step of the liquor interests, if
Congress granted the referendum,
would be to coerce and intimidate
> the people of Washington to vote
" against prohibition.
Alleges Reasons for Demand.
, The reasons the liquor interests fa}
vor a referendum of the prohibition
. question in the District, he said, lay
, in the fact that such a referendum
would give the interests an opporI
tunitv to defeat prohibition, even if
they had to use all means of corrup
tion to bring this end about, and the
fact that should prohibition win on the
I referendum the interests could go to
i ine courts ana anacK me constitutionality
of the law granting a referendum
to the people of the District
when the Constitution especially sets
' forth that Congress is to have sole
power of legislating for the federal
District. He contended that the referendum
would be a delegation of
power by Congress which might be
held to be unconstitutional.
To substantiate his charge that the '
liquor interests have attempted to influence
through improper means citizens
of the District to favor the referendum
Senator Jones told the Senate
that a president of one of the
largest national banks in the city had
been requested to sign a petition for
a referendum.
Accounts Withdrawn, He Says.
"Being a prohibitionist and regarding
the referendum petition as an anti
prohibition device, he refused," said
Senator Jones. "The caller, who was
a depositor in the bank, immediately
withdrew his account, amounting to
$6,000, as rebuke to the president. The
next day, for the same reason, another
; depositor withdrew his account amounting
to $7,000.
i ii*? ooaru 01 directors. learning or
1 the withdrawals, were, it is said, somewhat
concerned. There was a meeting
' of the board, and while the matter was
under discussion, a gentleman called
i at the hank and asked for the president.
who left the meeting to meet
i his visitor. The president was asked
. if it were true that he had refused to
I sign a petition for a referendum on
prohibition for the District, giving as
j a reason that he favors prohibition for
I the District. The president sajd that
he had refused to sign such petition
for the reason given. The caller said
he was glad to know it was true and
in order to show how glad he was he
' asked the privilege of opening an account
at the bank, and thereupon made
r an initial deposit of $60,000.

' Charges Attempt to Nullify Law.
r Senator Jones told the Senate that
H Congress would not now be confronted
with the question of prohibition for the
District had it not been for the fact
that the liquor interests had been ac"
tive in nullifying the Jones-Works exr
cise law, enacted a couple of years ago
? for the better regulation of the liquor
traffle in the District.
He said that the law was a model
regulatory law. and If properly adminy
istered would have been abreast of the
- general public sentiment in the District.
-! He continued:
I "It provided for an excise board to
be appointed by the President in the!
hope that, realizing the great moral interest
over which such a board would
exercise control, he would select men
who would enforce the plain provisions
of the law and wisely and justly
use the discretion vested in them to
conserve the public welfare from the
baneful effects of a traffic from which
no good comes to any one.
"It was hoped that political influences
would not control in the selection

would bfc given to their selection

law should be fairly and impartially

the railroad station at Conflans and
fourteen on the station at Metz. These
shells fell accurately. A number of
explosions were observed on the tracks,
and three fires were set in the Metz
railroad station.
"The French machines were subjected
to a violent cannonading during this
trip, but they all returned undamaged.
"During the course of an offensive
reconnoissance another of our air
squadrons threw down ten shells on
the aerodrome at Diguze and five more
on the railroad station at Arnavllle."
Last Night's Beport.

Loud Complaints C
Who Have Not
Yet to Cross
BY JUNIUS B. WOOD.
COLUMBUS. N. M.. March IS.?If the
American army were anxious to catch
Villa and his band before, it is doubly
so now that rewards running: into the
thousands have been put on his head.
The offer by Col. H. E. Slocum, who
was in command of the garrison here
on nit; uijsni %ji iiicnuiK>'uv.?..>.. ... I
sacre of $50,000 for the capture of Villa,
"under any circumstances," is the sensation
of the big camp. Every man in
the army, from commanding officers
to cook boys, has been itching to get
across the border and into the fray
ever since the orders came. The. reward
adds another incentive to the
patriotic zeal.
Col. Slocum, who is with Gen. Pershing,
in offering the reward, which is
the largest single amount named so
far, explained that he did so from
his personal funds. It is understood I
that he is amply able tp do this, as he is
reputed to be a millionaire and is a
nephew of Mrs. Russell Sage.
Takes Affair to Heart.
Since the sudden night attack and
massacre, friends of Col. Slocum say
? aViuho-u,! m:in Hp h?? luken
inai in; jo ?
it deeply to heart and to him it is a
personal matter, as well as a military
duty, to avenge the deaths of the Americans,
with many of whom he had become
personally acquainted while stationed
here.
That the offering of the rewards will
speed up the end of Villa is considered
certain. The information has gone out
through Mexico, And, many feel that it
will bring his death at the hands of it
faithless fellow-bandit or some daring
Mexican before American troops can
capture him. The men of the American
prairies who face death ns part of the
day's work are also on his trail, so far
as the strict border patrol will permit
them to get across the line.
Placing a price on a man's head by a
nation always has caused comment.
Many officers of the army have commented
on the propriety of Col.
Slocum's personal action. That- is one
reason the colonel made it clear that it
was entirely a personal offer. Regardless
of propriety, if there can be any
ethics in discussing Villa, civilians believe
that it will be a quicker acting
force than the $500,000 or more which
the government is paying for moving
the army.
Men Eager for Action.
Tn the men and officers of the army
the crossing into Mexico and the prospect
of action has been an elixir. The
only wail of dissatisfaction, and that
has been loud enough to reach from
ocean to ocean, is from those who are
left behind. In addition to the thousands
of troops arriving on the long
troop trains, others have straggled in
on every regular train to try to get
into the game. Old-time privates in
"cits" have come riding the bumpers
of freights to re-enlist and put on the
khaki again.
"Wish I had been here the other night,
I'd got some of them," they all say.
Into reserve brigade headquarters today
stalked a colonel who is to rejoin
his regiment in the 1'hilippines in June.
Until then*he insisted that he be permitted
t<T*go along.

that he was expecting a telegram from
Washington. His regiment is in Hono- j

the War Department to be transferred
to another regiment entering Mexico
and lost no time in getting on the

For two nights and a flay he sat in
the station on a scat nearest the operator.
He would doze and his hat would

he would rest his head on the operator's

(Jolumbus a Boom City.
Columbus, with the army here, is like
a boom city. It is worse than any country
village on circus day. It is a frontier
town, swamped with a hungry and busy 1
horde that it cannot care for. The two ?
little hotels have a waiting list, and
after qualifying by sleeping two or more
nights on the floor a guest is entitled to
share a room and bed with somebody
else?that is, if anybody has left, and '
those who leave are becoming fewer every
day.
Vacant and deserted stores are opening
as lunchrooms, and all day, until
they are eaten out, a line of hungry ' t
people is in front of them, waiting to ^
get a place to sit and eat. What was
left of the stock of the stores after 1
the bandit raid has been almost ex- s
hausted. The soldiers are hungry, the ^
officers coming- from a distance need
supplies and more civilians are in the
town than it ever dreamed of seeing,
even after the railroad made it a regular
stopping place.
Columbus itself could step into a e
western moving picture, with cowboys r
dashing in and the postmaster's beau- j
tiful daughter being captured by an _
Indian. Only there are no Indians, few ?
Mexicans and most of the beautiful
daughters have fled to safer spots. Half
of the houses are adobe, the coolest
building under the burning prairie sun,
and, though there are streets, it is just
as easy to cut or ride across the smooth
sand, as the buildings do not number
more than three or four to a block.
Too Excited for Publication.
The telephone exchange is in a frame
lean-to in the one-story building of
the weekly paper. There was no issue
the week of the raid, as the editor was
too excited, but he promises to have
one oyt today and tell all about it.
The telephone operator, or her
brother, censors all messages. The best
restaurant nas two tables which seat
four and a counter with three high
chairs. A little woman runs it and
wpits on the customers, while her big
husband smokes his pipe and gossips
with the visitors. The surviving leading
hardware merchant waits on customers
with one hand, with three bullet
holes in the other arm, while his
wife cares for a crying baby and wraps
the bundles.
Nearly every building nas its bullet
holes. Where the front windows of
the stores were smashed in, new glass
is being set. Where there is a clean,
round hole in a center of a spider web
of cracked glass, it remains as a souvenir
of the raid night. Greed of the
bandits to loot stores saved the population
from massacre. If they had
first attacked tta barracks of the
sleeping, soldiersj; and. put them to
flight, as is believed was Villa's inten

Across the tracks from the town is er
the army city. All week, at all hours rc

been arriving. Over this city hangs a
constant cloud of dust from the galloping
horses and heavy wagons and st
auto trucks. In the little depot the
hitsv statinn n?r*nt and nn? assistant
seldom sleep. Part of the single waiting
room has been fenced off with
rough boards for a telegraph office. It j
is busy twenty-four hours of the day *
with the army orders and rush of news.

to Army in Pursuit of
Villa Bandits.
American troops pursuing Villa
id his bandits have no intention
id no orders to occupy any cities
r towns during their march into
lexico.
This was stated at the White
ouse and War Department toay
after the receipt of a report
lat Gen. Gavira, the Carranza
immander at Juarez, had given
Dtice that Gen. Pershing's troops
ould not be allowed to occupy
asas Grandes or other towns.
TJW- nn TntrneiAn
nut, juiac ou a."?c?ivua
It is declared by administration offials
that the pursuit of Villa, being
itirely a punitive expedition, had none
' the characteristics of an invasion,
id that there was no object in'occu.'ingr
towns or cities, because the
merican troops will keep constantly
i the move.
rhe State Department today received
om Gen. Funston, through the War
epartment, a request to arrange with
e de facto government for permlson
to ship by rail from El Paso supies
to the expeditionary forces in
exico. The matter will be immediely
taken up with the de facto govnment
probably through Ellsip Arsdondo,
Mexican ambassador designed
here. It is believed the Mexican
jvernment will make no objection to
ich an arrangement.
To Ask Carransa's Consent.
By shipping supplies as far as posble
by railroad Gen. Funston will
? able to surmount the difficulties of
itomobile transportation over the^bar;n
country to the south of EI Paso.
Gen. Funston's request will be forarded
to Gen. Carranza at once with
le suggestion that the de facto gov nment,
which owns the controlling
ock of the road, permit the use of line
accordance with the request.
State Department officials were in>rmed
by counsel for Mr. Carranza
>day that the request in all probabily
would be granted. Only one condion,
it was said, might prevent the de
government from acceding to the
;quest, that being the uncertainty of

known that the Carranza governlent
had consented to the use of the

EL PASO. Tex.. March
18.?Gen. Gavira, Carranza
commander at Juarez, in a
statement given today to
the Associated Press declared
that the crisis in the
relations between the United
States and Mexico is past,
and that there is no further
need to fear trouble.
Francisco Villa is in the
neighborhood of Cruces,
no miles south of Casas
Grandes, according to information
received today by
Gen. Gavira.
Camp at Colonia Dublan.
EL PASO, Tex.. March 18.?
American cavalrymen pursuing
Francisco Villa were camped at
dawn today at Colonia Dublan,
one of the environs of Casas
Grandes. They arrived in the
night.
Through Colonia Dublan runs
the road to the Galeana district,
twenty-five miles southeast, where
Villa was last definitely reported.
Allays Fears of Clash.
The news of the encampment
at Colonia Dublan dispelled fears
of any disputes with constitutionalist
authorities over what
position the American troops
should occupy at Casas Grandes.
Mormon scouts dashed into
Colonia Dublan last night with
the news that the Americans were
near. The column which was
first into tlii> important American
settlement was said to he the
cavalry from Hachita.
Columns Mfcy Be United.
Dispatches direct from Mexico, and
the official announcement from Maj.
Gen. Funston, made it evident today
that the two American columns, one
from Columbus, X. M., under Gen. Pershing:,
and the other from Hachita, X.
M.. under Col. Dodd, had gotten into
| close communication with each other
and probably had formed an actual
junction when a little more than half
way on the route to Casas Grandes.
Something- of the strategy of the dash
on Villa's trail also was revealed. The
Hachita column made its start from
San Bernardino ranch, which is about
the size of a large county, where the
state pf New Mexico extends some fortymiles
south of the general east and
west line of the American border. By
using this American territory for the
first part of their advance from Hachita
the flying cavalry command of
Col. George Dodd was able to strike
into Mexico at tne snoriest distance
from Casas Grandes, a little more than
sixty miles of march.
Pershing- Veered to West.
The majn column, under Gen. Pershing-,
at Columbus, X. M., starting
from a point considerably farther
north of Casas Grandes, did not go due
south, but apparently veered to the
westward to get into tou'-h with the
cavalry command from Hachita.
Reports here that Gen. Pershing's
(army Intended to establish a base at
Guzman were discounted in dispatches
I that Guzman was still held by Carranza
troops and that the American
columns were marching about twenty|
five miles to the westward. This
j would put them very close to the route
of the cavalry command of Col. Dodd.
Guzman is an important constitutionalist
garrison town, about thirty miles
directly south of the point where Gen.
Pershing entered Mexico, and by going
past it to the west no question of occupation
was raised.
A young American, the son of J. P.
Stanford, who arrived here today from
Guzman, said that early yesterday he
was informed that the American main
column under Gen. Pershing already was
well to the south and west of Guzman.
Some Americans left Guztnan for the
west, he said, to see the American
troops.
