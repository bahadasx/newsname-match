MAN MERCHANT MARINE^*
WITH AMERICAN SEAMEN
Best Interests of Nation Demand
That Chief Features Be
Preserved.
"While the Duluth Commercial club
was resolving against" the Seamen's
act without giving friends of the
measure an opportunity to be heard,
Julius Barnes, our foremost fellow
townsman was telling the Chicago
grain men that the act was a great
blessing to American vessel owners
and American sailors.
Mr. Barnes is reputed to be the
world's greatest grain exporter. He
knows more about rail and water
transportation problems than any
man in the northwest, and perhaps
in the country. He fails to see any
dangers ahead because of the pas­
sage of the much misrepresented
seamen's act, and Mr. Barnes ought
to see them if any man could.
Man Our Own Ships.
The Duluth man also realizes the
necessity of building an American
merchant marine to be manned by
American seamen, and instantly ob­
serves the possibilities offered
through the seamen's act to bring
this about. He also recognizes the
importance of a large navy, but he
wants the navy to consist of Amer­
icans who can be depended upon in
time of war. And this is how he
puts it:
"We have a great deal of talk to­
day about the need of a larger navy
for the United States and we are all
convinced that this is necessary.
What kind of seamen do you want to
man the American navy in time of
trouble? Do you want a trained
American seamanship to handle war
vessels and vessels which may be­
come naval auxiliaries or do you
want our commerce ships manned by
ignorant and foreign-born labor of a
lower standard?
The Call of the Sea.
The old American spirit of adven­
ture which peopled the Middle West,
crossed the Great Plains and fought
its way" to the Pacific is still in exist­
ence but tlie plains are gone and the
mountain recesses' are' ho longer
wilds.
"The sea, however, is still sounding
the lure of its early days it still
reaches the unknown clime and the
unknown country it still calls to ,the
.spirit of adventure which produces
resourcefulness arid self-reliance and
courage.
"If you are going to man the
American merchant marine with
American labor and American in­
telligence you must give them fit
conditions to live under and proper
protection. You must not ask them
to live like Chinese sailors nor Ma­
lays r,jr even the poverty-stricken
natives of southern Europe.
Approves Seamen's Law.
"I have seen no public journal say
one word in commendation of. the
Seamen's Act but as I read that Act
there is much of merit to it. Changes
may be necessary, but they, should be
fought out on their merits and not on
misstatemnts.
"Do you believe one single Amer­
ican owner has sold an ocean carrier
because he "could not exist after the
Seamen's Act," when the profits in
ocean transportation are as I have
outlined? I don't believe that that is
the reason, and I don't believe a fair
and just outcome of our efforts to
solve the problem of our merchant
marine will be reached by anything
but teaching the American public the
truth and what remedy we need.'
One thing is sure: we must no longer
let German lines nor British lines
control the freight rates which gov­
ern the commerce of our commod­
ities.
For America First.
"It is beyond human expectation to
believe, that, for instance, a German
ocean line that has the making of

There are two ways of making a

80MPEBS OPPOSES
Citizen Tells! Declares
Against Federalized
Militia Unless Exempt From
Strike Duty.
AREDNESS IS AN
ECONOMIC PROBLEM
Principles Of Human Welfare
Can Not Be Ignored In Plans
For Defense.
NEW YORK, March 17.—The
Washington correspondent of The
New York Tribune quotes President
Gompers as opposing any plan to
"federalize" the state militia unless
there is included a provision against
its further use in the suppression of
strikes. Another declaration by the
A. F. of L. executive is that "the bur­
den of costs for increasing armament
must be distributed equally among all
classes, instead of bearing most heav­
ily on the wage earners and consum­
ers, as heretofore."
"The fact that we have chosen to
call our system of government in the
United States a republic," Gompers
said, "does not insure us either pro­
tection or peace. Preparedness is an
economic as well as a civic and mili­
tary problem. The principles of
human welfare can not be ignored in
plans for national defense any more
than they can be ignored in industry
or commerce. The safeguarding of
hflman rights and freedom are of
fundamental importance, and are
correlated with national defense.
They must not be sacrificed to any
false concept of national defense.
It Must Be Genuine
"To what end will a nation be
saved if the citizens are denied that
which gives life value and purpose?
The preparedness favored by labor
must be genuine. There must be no
sham, no pretence, no half-way meas­
ures. There must be industrial, com­
mercial, political, social, moral as
well as military defense. Citizen sol­
diery must be established and ex­
tended. It must be democratically
organized, officered and controlled.
We must put an end to the present
wasteful and unfair administration of
our military affairs.
"To say that we will leave the ad­
ministration of such- powers in the
hands of the privileged few is to sur­
render it in advance. It can only be
in the hands of the democracy of
America. Wherever the spirit of
democracy is absent, there the ac­
companying evil of militarism fastens
its deadly clutches upon freedom and
civic opportunity, just as, conversely,
where the spirit of democracy obtains
it is to the abolition of military castes
and the vicious dangers of militarism.
"Preparedness/ democratic prepar­
edness, must b^ against enemies at
home as well as enemies without our
borders. It must take in many fac­
tors. Labor and the poor ought not
to bear the bulk of the burden—the
cost of war at home and the sacrifice
of war at the front."
NEW YORK, March 17.—"You
think that you are professional peo­
ple, but I tell you the hod carrier you
see in the streets is getting more
money than you," said President
Gompers in an address to teachers in
this city who are discussing affiliat­
ing with the American Federation of
Labor.
"Musicians did not want to mingle
with machinists some years ago," he
continued. "Now every impresario of
note belongs to the union and they
are getting 50 per cent more money
to live on than ever before.
"There is not the slightest danger
of your union being called out in a
sympathetic strike. I pledge you my
word there is no power in the A. F.
of L. that can direct you to strike
or not to strike. That is left in your
hands."

was made by Prof. Scott Nearing, To­
ledo university, Sunday night, in Mil­
waukee. His subject was "Working
and Owning for a Living."
"From medieval times," said Near­
ing, "society has faced a situation in
which the few have said to the many,
'you work and earn bread and we will
eat it.'
"The statement of Capt. John Smith
to the Virginia colonists, 'he that will
not work neither shall he eat,' is one
of the most concise statements of
economic justice ever made.
Should Work or Own.
"Economic theories to be of value
to us now must fit the facts, must ex­
plain the facts and must be applicable
to economic conditions which exist
here and now.
"What are the facts in America to­
day You must either work for a liv­
ing or own for a living. The railroad
laborer works 3,000 hours and re^
cieves $500 in wages. Another man

armory matter just now. The referendum case is 40
go to the supreme court and all we can do is to abide
our time and *&wait the decision.
While'we are waiting it may be well to take ut,
the question of the unorganized wage earners in Duluth.
The leaders of the labor movement are busily engaged
in a great campaign of organization in this city. Onf
union of machine operators to consist of 500 members
is already on i,ts way. Several weak unions are being
strengthened, and all bids well for the skilled wor&
men.
But what about the great army of unskilled workers?
Has not the time arrived to organize them? This should
be the next move on the part of the labor organizers.
No field was ever more ripe for organization. No body
of wage earners is so poorly paid. The unskilled, un­
organized workers are plodding away at the. same wage
they were earning twenty years ago. Sometimes, when
jobs are scarce, their wages take a sudden rise, but this
is only temporary, for when jobs become plentiful down
come the wages to a figure far below the cost of living.
No workingman in Duluth can decently provide a
liome and raise a family on less than $3 a day, yet many
of them—a great many—receive much less than thls»
wage. Indeed many employers believe they are ever So
gracious and generous when they offer their working
men $2 a day. But no man can do justice to his
family on such a meager wage. He must have more,
and the only way he can get it is to organize arid
demand it. It will never be handed to him on a silver
platter.
So this is an appeal to the unskilled workers of.
Duluth to take advantage of the opportunity now
presented to them to organize a federal labor union.
There never was a better time to do it. An unskilled
workers' union 1,000 strong should be on its way this
very moment, and it would be if these workers would
wake up.
Men often ask: "Why is it bricklayers get 80 centB
an hour while the laborers on the same job are paid
but 20 cents an hour?" The answer is easy: "The
bricklayers are organized, and the laborers are not
organized. The reason is plain."
Longshormen are paid 50 cents an hour. They are
so-called unskilled laborers, although it requires certain
experience to properly load a boat with lumber, but they
are unskilled laborers nevertheless. They are
paid
cents an hour because they are organized.

WASHINGTON, March 7.— The
Bradeis muckraking committee, other­
wise known as the subcommittee of
the senate judiciary committee, which
has just completed its hearings, has
had a free hand in the conduct of its
operations.
The committee has-been at liberty
to rake anywhere, anything, anyhow.
Brandeis' friends have interposed no
objections of any sort. Anything any­
body had to offer—opinion, gossip,
heresay, facts, half-facts and miscel­
laneous slander—whatever the muck­
rake might encounter—-has been piled
up and made part of the Senatorial
Record.
Senators Overman, of North Caro­
lina, and Clake, of Wyoming, have
plied the rake with industry. If any­
body, anywhere, had ever heard or
thought anything prejudicial to the
good name of Louis Brandeis, he was
pounced upon with a subpoena duces
tecum and ordered to fetch it along.
The officials of the shoe machinery

held last winter lobbying against the
tieing clause in the Clayton anti-trust
ast—were diligently on the job. They
actually sat at the lawyers' table,
alongside Mr. Fox (hired by the New
One works, the other owns.
This is the basis of our American
economic system. Dividends are paid
on one kind of ownership and inter­
est on another kind of ownership.
This is true of every corporation in
the United States. Of every $22 re­
ceived by the railroads of the country,
$13 are paid to the workers and $9 to
the owners.
"What we must consider in this
connection are facts and not theories
of value. The facts are that under
our modern economic system the
worker works three days for himself
and two days for the owners.
Un-American Not Nice.
"This is neither American nor nice.
It is the worst anti-social influence
possible. It is opposed to the well-be­

phasis on property instead of on men.

A score of girls employed by the

AND POLITICAL PROGRESS.
Worktrs it will do for the unskilled workers everywhere.
The trouble with too niany worklngmen is they expect
that one of these days something will strike them and
drive their wages up with a bang. This will never
happen. It never has happened.
Then there are certain workingmen who believe if
they elect,the right kind of men to public office it will
raise their wages. They have been doing this for a
hundred years and the results are always the same.
JTfcere is no hope for the workers by political action
alone. Governments do not control wages. They are
by one of two agencies. Where the laborers are
well organized the unions fix the wage scale, and where
there are no unions the employers fix it. When the
employers adjust the wage scale without giving labor
any voice in the adjustment, the scale is paid according
to the relation between the number of jobs on hand as
compared with the number of men who have no jobs.
When the union has a word to say about the wages
that 'should be paid the number of men on hand and
the number of jobs that are open has little to do with it.
Cost of living is the principle factor involved, and the
wage scale is made accordingly.
Now the cost of living in Duluth is far above the
amount paid in wages to the unskilled, unorganized
^wage earners. And there is no reason for this situation,
except" that the unskilled workers and many of the
skilled workers have failed to organize. Look at this
question from every standpoint and you will come to
but one conclusion, and that is Duluth laborers will
Jttever get a living wage unless they organize. This, at
the present moment, is the most important thing for
them to do.
Never mind what the real estate men say. Never
mind what any one says, labor's only salvation is in
Organization.
Then when the workers once effectually organize
they can. prepare to press their demands for more wages.
•It-will .be folly to lead out the hope that men who
now receive $2 a day can at one organized stroke receive
$3 a day. They must pay the penalty for tardiness in
organisation. They can at least make an effort to
receive $2.25 a day. And next year they can go after
$2.50, after which they will be in a position to demand
$2.75 and keep at it patiently until they are paid $3 a
ty.. That is how the organized workers played the
*me, and that is how they won.
So if the unorganized workers really want to better
their condition,, they should at once gather at Brown's
all, 10 East Superior street, and tell U)t&<f£J£|AI3ntatives
organized labor that they want to organize. These
ftt|n only^eed ahipt, and they will do the rest.
,^,v.The watchword oilhUuthnnion, labor from now on
should be: "Organise the unskilled workers and put
them- on the road for a $3 per day Wage scale."

Vote—Denounce Stand of
Democratic Party.
WASHINGTON, March 17—Taking
exception to. the statement of Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt that there are
less than 3,000.000 women voters in
the western states, the Congressional
union issued a statement that at least
4,000,000 women will' be 'eligible to
vote at the 1916 elections.
The statistics are based on the cen­
sus of 1910, which gives the female
population above 21 years in the vot­
ing states at 3,666,445. By comput­
ing the increase during the last five
years at one-half, the approximate
female population at the present time
is said by the union to be 4,400,114.
In its call the union says:
"The candidate of the party in
power will run on the record of his
party for the last four years. If these
4,000,000 women, or any considerable
number of them, believe that the su­

JUDGE O'BRIEN SAYS
ITS CONSTITUTIONAL
Strong Committee Appointed to
Draft Bill to Be Presented to
Legislature.
The State Federation of Labor has
fired its first big gun for state inusr
ance. Labor is not satisfied with the
workingmen's compensation act, al­
though it is admitted that the pres
ent law is far superior to employers'
liability. But workingmen are not
content with a, system of compensa­
tion that permits the claim agents of
Private companies to stand between
injured men and their employers in
the settlement of accident claims.
The executive council of the State
Federation of Labor held a two day's
session this week at St. Paul at
which the question of state insurance
was carefully considered. The con­
stitutionality of union labor's pro­
posed law was brought into question
by its opponents and an opinion on
the question was obtained from for­
mer supreme court justice, Thos.
O'Brien of St. Paul. He held that
there was nothing, in the constitution
of the state to prevent the state from
providing for a system of state insur­
ance.

Labor Commissioner W. F. Houk
took part in the deliberations and he
was assisted by his statisticians,
Frank Hoffmann and Don D. Lesch
hier. Many well known labor men
from the Twin Cities participated in
the discussion. President Hall ap­
pointed a committee of exceptionally
strong men to draft a bill to be pre­
sented to the state legislature at its
next session. The following were se­
lected: H. P. Waters, St. Paul Fred
Hestor, Minneapolis Henry Pereault,
Duluth G. W. Lawson, and A. E.
Smith, St. Paul.
The bill will provide for aminimum
wage of $6.50 and a maximum, of
$12, as in the Ohio law. The amounts
for permanent disability and for
death wil! also be materially in­
creased.
The council transacted consider­
able business of importance to the
workingmen of Minnesota. Secretary
Lawson brought before the meeting
matters pertaining to the child labor
and immigration bills now pending in
congress. Letters were read from
jSeveral congressmen and senators in
which their respective views were
given, and the council went on record
in favor of the passage of both meas­
ures. EVery Minnesota "representative
in congress was urged to support
each of, the bills when it comes up
for vote.
President Hall and each of the vice
presidents gave interesting reports of

WASHINGTON, March 17.—The

Wh)le it is agreed that anti-child

they insist that it is "steady," and

WASHINGTON, Mar. 16.—Indorse
ing the principle of the Crosser bill,
(now pending in congres, for "foster
ing, promoting and developing the
welfare of the wage earners of the
United States by creating new oppor­
tunities for permanent and profitable'
employment," Frank P. Walsh, chair
man of the committee on on industrial
relations, has issued the following
statement:
"The bill invokes and applies to the
lands of the public domain in the ab­
solutely right doctrine that the title
to land shall depend on its productive
use.
,'The Crosser bill is not only right
in itself. It points the way that legis­
lation should go to prevent specula­
tion and private monopoly in natural
resources. It recognizes as far as it
goes the 'unalienable right of the com­

the values that the community creates
and it recognizes the equally -divine
right of the producer and toiler to get
and keep that wealth which his own
labor has produced.

system so as to exempt from taxation
all improvements, and tax unused
land at its full rental value.
"2. Vigorous and unrelenting pro­
secution to regain all land, waiter,

from the government by fraud.
"3. A general revision of our land
laws, so as to apply to all future l^fid

as in the cases of the water rights in1,
California, and provision for forfeit
