A traveling man : was heard to sav
one day recently that . many whole
sale houses will not send out an agent
wno smokes cigarets. .because most
business men are disgusted at the
sight of a man smoking a cigaret and
will not buy goods of him. The time
is coming when the same sentiment
will prevail with , regards to the. use
of the weed in any form.
