There is nothing like enterprise in
such matters.

Unconfirmed Reports Tell of
Mutinies Among Mexi
can Soldiers.
Washington, March 18.—Villa and
his bandits are fleeing rapidly before
the American expeditionary forces in
northern Mexico, in the opinion of
army officers here. This belief is
based on dispatches from American
columns that reported that none of
the outlaws have been seen up to late
yesterday, and the strengthened opin
ion is that the Villa forces would not
attempt to make a stand.
Army men declared that the cam
paign would quickly develop into
guerilla warfare if there is any oppo
sition.
Enter No Towns.
The American troops, pursuing Vil
la have no intention and no orders
to occupy any cities or towns during
their march into Mexico. This is
stated at the White House, also at the I
war department.
Washington, March 18.—General!
Funston's sole report to the war de
partment today was ."all quiet along:
the border."
200 Arrive.
The navy department reports from
Vera' Grufc^sfty. that about 1VOO Ameri
cans from Mexico City and'1 other in
terior points have arrived there, most
of them acting upon advices from
friends arid relatives in the United
States, urging them to leave Mexico.
The conditions at Vera Cruz, the mes-«]
sage said, are quiet and many Ameri
cans after investigation of the reports
as to the situation, are returning to
the interior.
Up to Pershing.
San Antonio, March 18.—"Whether
the American troops hunting Villa
will enter towns or not is for General
Pershing to decide," said Funston.
Unless otherwise instructed by the
war department, Funston is disposed
not to interfere with the details of
Pershing's operations. He is not in
clined to believe, however, that Persh
ing would make an issue of Gavria's
announcement and that Pershing will
not be permitted to enter towns.
MANYlORSES
SENT TO EUROPE
As Many go in One Month
Now as Went Formerly
in a Whole Year.
Washington, March 18—The Unit
ed States shipped 678,443 horses and
mules valued at $131,914,000, to Kur
ope for the allied armies in the last
year and a half, according to export
figures assembled yesterday in the
bureau of foreign and domestic com
merce.
During the whole of 1913 only a few
more than 30,000 horses and mules
went to Europe from the United
States, but three months after hostili
ties began they were going at the rate
of 30,000 a month, the steady flow
reached its height last October, when
56,000 were shipped.
Despite a diminishing supply, the
price of farm animals has dropped
considerably within the last few
months, which Is explained by the
statement that only the best horses
left the country, lowering the general
standard and also by the increased use
of gas engines and automobiles. The
average price January 1, 1916, was
$101.60 compared with $103.15 a year
ago and $109.14 in 1914. The average
price of animals supplied to the allies
was upward of $200.
Ordinarily the rate of Increase in
horses and mules is about 1 per cent
a year, but last year the European
demand caused the supply to dimin
ish by about 36,000 animals. The de-,
partment of agriculture on January'
1 estimated the number of farm ani
mals In the United States at about
28,000,000. A census bureau estimate
put* the number in cities at 8,500,000.

found lying/on a hay stack in the

by bis son, few moments later.
Mental qferangement caused by
frightful headaches to which Mr.
Spoonheim was subject is believed to
have been the" cause of the rash act.
Mr. Spoonheim had carefully settled
up all of his affairs a day. or two
previously.
Eight Survive Him.
He is survived by eight children,
several living at Hatton, N. D., and
others in Montana. A brother, H. K.
Spoonheim was formerly a member
of the board of trustees of the state
university.
Just previous to cutting his throat,
Mr. Spoonheim had been in the barn
with his son, Paul Spoonheim. He
went out to the rear of the structure,
and a short time later the son went
In search of him.
Slashed Own Throat.
He discovered Mr. Spoonheim's
body lying on top of the hay. The
throat was cut on both sides. A bot
tle of iodine was lying near the body
and the lips we're stained by the poi
son. Mr. Spoonheim had evidently
first slashed his throat and then at
tempted to drink the deadly fluid.
Coroner McLean was summoned,
but decided that there was no neces
sity for an inquest, the evidence plain
ly pointing to suicide.
Tt is supposed that the violent head
aches to which Mr. Spoonheim had
been subject for -some time past had
deranged his brain.
Only the members of the family
were present at ttte funeral services.
Important Session of Hospit
al Commission Just
Completed.
Ottawa, March 18—An important
session of the military hospitals com
mission has just been concluded here.
Members were present from Ontario,
Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Manitoba. The work of the
commission is increasing as the num
ber of men returning from the front
grows week by week. The reports
presented of the activities of the pro
vincial commissioners which are deal
ing with the question of employment
were most satisfactory. It may be
stated that at the present juncture no
man requiring work and able to work
need be idle.
Since the appointment of a voca
tional secretary, steps have been tak
en towards giving elementary train
ing to men at the convalescent homes,
and schools have been established in
one or two of these institutions. It is
found that a number of the men are
ready to avail themselves of the op
portunity thus afforded to fit them
selves more effectively for the work
before them.
Made Careful Inquiry.
W. M. Dobell, who has just return
ed from a trip to Europe, where he
made a careful and exhaustive in
quiry into the methods adopted in
England and France in financial and
vocational training, presented a re
port which will shortly be issued by
the commission. Mr. Dobell pointed
out that although a great deal had
been done in the countries visited by
him along the lines of special training
for men who had lost the use of cer
tain limbs, very much of the present
work was experimental.
The commission has already taken
steps to put into effect some of the
methods referred to by Mr. Dobell.
Electro-therapeutic and mechanical
apparatus have been installed in some
of the convalescent homes, notably in
the central military convalescent
home, Toronto, and the benefits it is
stated, are very marked.
It was decided -that a land settle
ment scheme, which has been under
discussion between the military hos
pitals commission and the economic
and development commission for some
time past, should shortly be submit
ted for consideration by the provinces.
Create Pensions Board.
As the basis on which pensions are
granted and the amount of such pen
sions is closely allied to a satisfac
tory settlement of returned invalided
and wounded soldiers in civil life, the
commission discussed this matter at
length, and decided to urge upon the
government the creation of a perma
nent pensions board on the lines of
the railway commission, consisting of
three or five members, who would de
vote their whole time to this work.
It also resolved to recommend that
pensions In Canada should be based
upon the degree of disability not upon
the loss of the pensioner's earning
powers.

Washington, March 18.—The house

YUCATAN TAKES
JUDGMENT
[Judgment was for $472,000
Against Abel Oritz, For
mer Governor.
New York. March 18—The state of
Yucatan, Mexico, took judgment in
the state supreme court here yester
day for $472,000 against Abel Oritz
Argumedo, its former governor, who
now lives in this city. An order also
wu granted restraining a safe de
posit company from permitting Ar
gumedo or his agents to remove any
part of the contents of the vault hired
by him.
The state of Yucatan contended
that Argumedo fled from Mexico in
March of last year taking with him
the equivalent of $447,000 in Ameri
can money which belonged to the
state and should be turned over to
the present government. It was for
this sum, with accrued interest that
judgment was granted. Argumedo
contended that he had not been legal
ly succeeded by the Carranza gover
nor who is now in office, and said he
had intended to hold the money until
he could turn it over to the "lawful
government" of Yucatan.
The state argued, in rebuttal, how
ever, that Argumedo had vacated the
office of governor according to the
unwritten constitutions of Mexico and
Yucatan when-he left the country.

Berlin, March 18.—The national liberal group of the
Reichstag decided to introduce at this session its measure
calling for the carrving on of submarine war.
MESSAGE TO VON TIRPITZ.
The national liberals sent the following message to
Admiral von Tirpitz:
"We are deeply moved by the news of the retirement
of your excellency in the present difficult time. We send
to the creator of our navy, and the father of the German
naval spirit assurance of the truest and most thankful de
votion.
THE RESOLUTION.
The measure introduced in the Reichstag this after
noon by the national liberal party reads as follows:
"Considering that Great Britain not only makes war
on the armed forces of Germany, but has taken measures
in order to impede the providing of Germany with food sup
plies and raw material, so as to compel Germany to submit
through hunger, for which purpose Great Britain brutally
A'iolates
international law and employs force against neu
tral countries considering further that Germany is able
through unlimited and unrestrained submarine warfare to
increase the British lack of tonnage so that it can be made
extraordinarily difficult and perhaps impossible for the
British nation to obtain sufficient supplies of food and If!
speedily bring a victorious end of the war, the imperial
chancellor is required to enter into no arrangements with
other countries which would hinder us in the unlimited use
of the submarine weapon and to permit in the war zone,
against the enemy's traders, with the exception of passen
ger .ships, such use of submarines as'arises from the pecu-«
liarity of said weapon,"
Similar bills were, also:brouglit forward and

Harmony Urged Between
Men and Company by Sec
retary of Company.
Topeka, Kan., Maroh 18.—Officials
of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad company counselled with
more than 4,000 employes of the road,
who filled the municipal auditorium
here late yesterday, and told them
that, the demands of the enginemen
and trainmen brotherhoods for an
eight hour day with time and a half
pay for overtime work were unjust.
The employes listened to the address
but made no demonstration. No vote
was taken to show what their position
In the controversy would be.
"The enginemen and trainmen do
not really want a reduction in running
time," declared C. W. Kouns, general
manager of the company. "Their
demands mean only greater pay. The
demands would give them a 25 per
cer increase in compensation. These
employes now receive 28 per cent of
the entire wage payment of the com
pany and our management has taken
the position that they are getting
their share.
"The enginemen and trainmen are
working under a special contract, but
the labor leaders have given the im-'
pression that the fight is to maintain
the principle of the eight hour day.
That is not so. The enginemen and
trainmen are employed under a spe
cial contract which permits them to
charge either for the time 'put in or
the miles run.''
E. L. Copeland, secretary and treas
urer of the company, urged harmonv
between the company and the em
ployes.
J. W. Gibbons, foreman of the paint
shop here, and James Mullin, assistant
foreman of the blacksmith shop, spoke
briefly, urging the employes to stand
by tae company.
LIVELY FIGHT EXPECTED.
Washington, March 18.—A lively
fight is in prospect in the conference
committee on the bill increasing the
limit of deposits in postal savings
banks. It will come over an amend
ment inserted by the senate, permits
ting the postmaster general to desig-%
nate certain offices as main offices for
the postal savings business with other
offices in contiguous locations asS
branch offices.
Representative Halvor Steenerson I
said that it would be possible under,
this amendment for the postmaster-^
general to abolish over 60,000 postof-,
(ices by vacating the postmasterships
and open the door to favoritism in..
subsequent appoiontments to fill va
cancles. '"i
The same proposition was rejected,'
by the house postoffice committee. Mr,
Steenerson yesterday was appointed a
member of the conference committee
on the part of the house, audi he
hopes to fores the senate to recedfc.
