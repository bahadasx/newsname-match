As district nttornoy, Kuykendall
nindo-ft record that will long stand
unequalled. During Ills term of offlco
Klnmath county wob undergoing a
great boom, with unusual actlvltlas
by the railroads, reclamation sorvlco
nnd others, bringing hundreds of
transient to tho county.
Many crtmcH wero committed by
these people, tho criminal business
tubing up thogreater part of the cir
cuit court's time, and througW his
activities, Kuykendall effectively
cleaned up several lawless crowds,
weeded out undesirables and brought
otout n much greater respect for law
and order.
Kuykendall was the choice of the
majority of tho Klamath county bar's
members for the circuit bench when
rtoatli removed Hon. George Noland

"Didn't you go around the back,
way purposely to get Lawrence and
Hunter, to plrk.them off?" thundered'
Itenner.
"No," wns tho response. "They
were both gone before that."
Homier and Kuehne tangled gorae
what on tho matter of the gun sig
nals. Kuehne said he had arranged
with the'Todds. Itenner Insistently
nsked Kuehno if he had not in direct
examination stld W. H. Todd wns
present when these signals wero ar
ranged, nnd Kuehne ns stoutly main
tained that ho said no such thing,
holding thnt W. H. Todd wnB not
present. Itenner nsked If Kuehne had
not talked this over with the attor
neys for the stato last night, and the
answer was "no.1
Tho question of the hogs Mrs.
Kuehne turned out Sunday at the
nuggcstlon of her sou next come up.
Asked whoso these were, Kuehne Bald
they belonged principally to Lawrence
nnd Hunter, and It devoloped that
some of Hunter's were penned and bo
Ing fattened.
When nsked why he turned the
hogs out, Kuehno answered that it
was to nllow thorn to get water. It
developed thnt thoro,was no water on
the placo other than the well, which
tin. Kuehnes wero then holding with
guns, and thnt the nearest other well
was a quarter of a mile off, with the
nearest running water close to two
miles distant.
"You didn't care If they wero wa
tered or not, did you?" Kuohne was
asked. His reply to the effect tnat "ir
ho didn't, he wouldn't havo turned
tho hogs out."
Thoro was somo dispute between
Kuehno and Itenner as to how the
horses were shot, and as to which
rlllo Kuehno used when he oponed flro
upon Hunter.
Theso two disputed nbout tho
eourso taken by tho wagon. Kuehno
stated that It wont back of tho house,
and Itenner asked It Kuehne hnd not
told Henry Stout nnd Mr. Holraan, the
day of the shooting that tho wagon
went botwoen tho house nnd the
county road. Kuehno answored no.
Itenner soeKs to show thnt the wag

that Kuebne ran around the other
side of tho .house In an auempi a
