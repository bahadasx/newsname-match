Economy or Waste?
George H. Edwards, Republician Nominee for
Mayor Attacks The Waste and Ineffi
ciency of Shannoq,-Jost Democrats.
He Asks 'How the People's
The city campaign, which Is now
In progress, has developed Into a fight
of tho better element of citizens for
ever to rid tho city hall of tho Shan-non-Jost
rabbits. Lined up on the ono
side we find the men of the type ol
Henry SI. Beardsley, on the other tho
political henchmen of Joo Shannon.
With the people united, regardless of
party, fighting for the best Interests
of the city, they can not be defeated
any more than tho United States army
can be defeated when the order is
given "to get Villa" and his bandits.
Look over this list of candidates,
whose private business success mark
them as' eminently fitted for the front
of the firing lino in this fight for good,
clean city government.
Head Mr. Edwards' statement in re
gard to the expenditure of your money
and see if your taxes havo brought
about the interest to you that it shoiild
have.
Statement by George H. Edwards.
"A good many claims have been
made by the mayor that tho Jost ad'
ministrations has made a considerable
saving to tho city, and his comptroller,
In a letter addressed to E. C. Sleser
vey, a copy of which appeared In the
Post under date of March 8, gives the
revenues collected.fof each year from
1904 to 1914. This shows that the In
creased revenues under Mr. Jost's ad
ministration over the largest amount
ever collected by any city administra
tion for the year 1912 was $118,6350;
for the year 1913, $210,563; for the year
1914, was $319,453. If tho same pro
portion applies to the year 1915 (the
figures for which the comptroller does
not give), It would make the increase
for. that year, between.. $500,000, and
$600,000. In other words, far from
saving money, the mayor has, during
the three years on which he gives us
tho figures, received increased reve
nues amounting to $04S,G4C more than

Now York, March 14, The Rev.
Ferrer F. Martyn, granduate of the
Union Theological Seminary, Ono
Hundred and Twentieth street and
Broadway, and the son of the Rev. W.
Carlos Martyn, lecturer, preacher and
author, was arrested last night as he
was entering a moving picture theater.
With him was Vera Davis, a come
ly young mulatto with whom he fled
from SL Louis In JMovember of last
year. Despite his parentago, Martyn
has for years preferred to be known
as a Negro and was acting as pastor
of tho First Negro Baptist Church in
the Missouri city until tho time of his
elopement.

any mayor that Kansas City ever had.
"According tb the comptroller's fig
ures, the first year of Sir. Deardsley's
administration the revenues collect
ed were $1,770,118.07. His own comp
troller says that In the year 1914
Mr. Jost collected revenues amounting
to $2,926,532.25. In other words. Sir.
Jost collected $1,500 more .revenue
during the year 191-f than Slayor
Beardsley did during the year 190C.
Besides, this, he decreased the effi
ciency of the police force by the rei
ductlon during these years of $292,
192, cutting down tho force the first
year that he was in office by 91 'men,
and thereby has placed Kansas City
in the unenviable position of being
classed with two other territories as
the worst policed section In the Unit
ed States; that is, the losses from
burglary in Kansas Ciy aro larger, In
proportion, than In any other part of
the United States excepting only Chi
cago and parts of California.
"He has decreased the efficiency of
the board Off public works by a reduc
tion of their appropriations in the
amount over $200,000, thereby crip
pling the department and making it
Impossible for them to keep the streets
and public places In proper condition.
"If you will add the excess amount
of revenue he has collected over those
collected by any other mayor to the
amount that he has reduced tho ap
propriation for the police and board of
public works, two of the most impor
tant departments of the city's service,
you will have a grand total of $1,143,
7C0. Sir. Jost now boasts that the
saving made during these thre years
of his administration" was $295,314, as
shown by his comptroller's report. The
question naturally arises: What In
the world did the mayor do with the
difference of $84,8,440. Can you seean

about himself he said he was "col

The girl, who was booked as Vera
Houston, said she had been living
with Martyn as his wife. She admit
ted ho had caused her presence In New
York, but added that he had not come
here with her.
Martyn's Father Wrote Book on Wen-
dell Phillips.
Martyn's father was once pastor of
the Pilgrim's Congregational Church
of St. Louis, one of the leading white
congregations of the city. Tho old
Pilgrim Church edifice there is now
occupied by a Negro Baptist congre
gation, and Ferry Martyn, proclaim
ing himself a Negro, has often spoken
from he pulpit where his father
spoke as a white man. .
The Rev. Dr. Carlos Martyn became
widely known as a preacher and au
thor and his book, "Wendell Phillips,
the Agitator," Is a highly rated biog
raphy of that noted Abolitionist. He
Is now pastor of a church in Connec

Brooklyn, also was white. He appear

In 1912 he was pastor of the Baptist
Church at Elmhurst, L. I. His en
gagement to Miss Grace Taylor, a
member of the congregation was an
nounced, and a strange woman ap
peared and Martyn disappeared. It
was then learned that previously ho
had suddenly resigned a pastorate in
Rldgewood, N. J.
The next heard of Martyn was when
ho began to pose as a Negro In St.

that his father was white, but his

Kansas City's oldest and best es

largest business of its kind West of
the Mississippi river. When this com

Negroes in Kansas City lived in alleys.

By tho guarantee plan originated by
Sir. Fortune J. Weaver, the president
and general manager, a house was pur
chased .here and another rented there
in desirable locations. This opened
the way for others and by gradually
adding to their holdings Negroes now
own many modern homes In choice

Out of the hundreds of homes that

Protection for Home Buyers.
Some of the reasons that this cor

confidence of the Negroes of Kansas
City: First, because when they rent
or buy from the Afro-American they
are kept employed so they can meet
their obligations; second, when this
mortgage comes due the Afro-American
sees to it that their mortgage is
extended or renewed.

PAGE VINDICATED BY CONVICTION
OF CONSPIRATORS.
After Hard Fought Trial, Lasting Ten
Days, Chlsum Is Found
Guilty.
On the second ballot, and after be
ing out less than thirty minutes, a
jury, that for ten days has been hear
ing testimony In the case of the state
against Slelvin J. Chlsum, charged
with criminal libel, brought In a ver
dict of guilty and left the penalty to
the judge to assess.
The verdict was unanimous, every
Juror signing it.
It is a vindication for former pres
ident Inman E. Page, of Langston uni
versity, against whom libelous charges
were made by Chlsum In his Oklahoma
City paper.
The penalty can be $1,000 fine, or
one year In jail, or both. It 1 sthe
opinion of many who heard the case
that he should be given both.
"I will pass sentence next Slonday,"
said Judge Chappelle, today.
The case consumed ten days' time
to try and has cost the county less
than $200. For the length of time tak
en to try it and the number of wit
ness examined, it Is decidedly the least
expensive' case tried of record in this
county. But it will cost the losing
side a pretty penny. Sixty witnesses
were subpoenaed by the defense. Chls
um will have to pay this expense.
Win. Graham, convicted last week
on a charge of blackmail, by attempt
ed extortion of money from President
Pago -Vvlll also be sentenced Slonday.
The penalty in tho Graham case is
the same as In the Chlsum case,
$1,000 fine and qne year in jail, or
both.
Graham is the man who first ap
proached President Page with an of
fer to suppress tho libelous article If
Page would pay him 4u. rresiaeni
Page indignantly refused to proposi
tion, and told Graham that he had no
desire to bribe anyone to not attack
him.
"Sly hands are clean. I fear noth
ing; if I am accused my accusers
must prove the charges," saw rage,
and with that he dismissed the mat
ter. The article was published. It
caused a sensation. President Page
tendered his resignation Jn order to
not hurt the .school he helped to
create and so dearly loved.
"I shall clear my skirts of all charges
and to do It without Injury to Langston
college I will resign," he told Governor
Williams. Then he brought the mat
ter Into court and has made a firm
fight for vindication not revenge.
Tho unanimous verdict of tho jury
last night, spells vindication.
But enemies of Langston, in the
meantime, have wrought havoc with
that school. It will take years to put
It back to tho high stato it was in
prior to tho attack on President Page.
Less han one-fifth tho attendance is
