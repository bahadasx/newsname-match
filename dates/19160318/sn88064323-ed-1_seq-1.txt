questioned in this district from
end to end—Democr at to parishes
included The fact that the Dun
ocrais at Washington have taken
put in undoing their free eugm
legislation is no guaiantee that
they are to bo trust, ,I any mote
than they were deserving of the
voters confidence before they
were given in trust the remodel
ing of national tariff legislation.
The policy of claiming every
thing in matters of election is an
old Democratic rule. They do
nor always fed confident of gain
mg all they claim. They ate
claiming this city and Die whole
parish, except Jeuieretle. in
speaking of .lean ereile, it re
minds us, that they were express
rg their hopes of being able to
redeem poor, IohI, Jeauerette by
a substantial Democratic claim,
on or before April 18 They
claim (or at least some over en
thusiastio follower and defender.)
that 400 persons went from New
Iberia by trolley to attend the
Jeauerette meeting on last Satur
day night, and that I UP more
went by autos, The N. 1 Brass
Band, also, went along. Now, if
theBe claims are agreeable to Dm
actual number of persons caiiicd
by the trolley, if is probable that
the trolley's registering machines
should be tepair< d. It takes about
20 autos to carry 100 persons of
average avnitdupois—wh< re were
these machines parked doting the
meeting? If the 400, plus the 100,
plus tire band from New Iberia
gained admittance to the bavny
Theatre, who of Du* .leanererte
population had a chance of hear
iug the distinguished speakers?
If our Democratic brothers be
lieve the claims they make about
carrying the state at the coming
electiou, are they not rather reck
less in the exercise of a selfish
privilege in calling all of the Lou.
tsiaua congressmen, save one,
home fiom Washington, if the
said congressmen are evet needtd
at Washington? Or, is if, really,
that the Democratic party needs
in this state are greater and su
perior to the needs of the nation
at this time?
Their acts tell us.- That while
the nation may need the councils
and advice of the Louisiana dele
gation, there is uo danger threat,
iug national Democracy just
now,—but, in Louisiana, the par
ty is imperilled and every hot-air

In the dark days of the French
reconstruction period the highest
title of honor permissible in ad
dressing a ettl ject of the country
was ''Citoyen.' 7 To the "citizen"
was referred the weightiest ques
tions of government. So it is to
day with us iu Iberia.
Mr. A. B. Romero of this city,
in Iris effor t to get the sovereign
property taxpayers and voters to
appreciate the ills of the present
system and law, is appealing to
them to elect him their sheriff—
not that he wants the office, but
he would pledge himself to Die
people to return to Die people a
great part of the princely emolu
ments of the office, If elected,
lie has issued a circular address
to the voters of this parish, giv
some interesting points in the
struggle for reform
While the people of the rtate
recognize the fact that the sheriffs
of this state are paid too much,
and ate proposing to enact such
legislation ns will prevent the
sheriff's pay exceeding that of the
Governor of the state, Mr Rome
ro believes in some shortcut be
ing taken to acquire the resu't
before it could be attained through
the ordinary channels.

"I want to tell you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the use of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs.^Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troubles. I firmly believe Black-Draught
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went In on her, but one good dose of Thedford's
Black-Draught made them break out, and she has had no
more trouble. I shall never be without

in my home." For constipation, indigestion, headache, dizzi
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and all similar
ailments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved itself a safe,
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy.
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black
Draught It is a medicine of known merit Seventy-five
years of splendid success proves its value. Oood ter
young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 25 cents.
