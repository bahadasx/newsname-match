"We are having a little trouble on

"Never was there a more pathetic

"I believe." he said, 'It is the duty

The column was reported to bo mov

section, while men on horseback, pre
sumably the guides, led the way. The
territory covered since the troops left
tho border was some 70 miles It is

American troops reach the district Into

he withstood the Diaz federals for so
many jears, that the will be facing a
chain of Constitutionalist camps and
garrisons.
The Namiquipa country Into which
Villa is withdrawing is one of the most
precipitous on the American continent
and is passable only by the use of
trails and narrow roads that will be
difficult for the passage of the equip

It has been pointed out by an Amer

United States Forces Will
Not Occupy Towns, War
Department Declares.
WASHINGTON, D C. March 18,-h
Tho state department today
received from Maj. Gen. Frede
rick Funston, through the war depart
ment a request to arrange with the
de faoto government of Mexico for per
mission to ship by rail from El Past
supplies to the expeditionary forces
in Mexico. The ahipmenta would prot
ably be made oTer the Mexico North
western to Casas Grandes.
Gen. Funston's request will be for
warded by the Mexican embassy here
to Gen. Carranza at onca with, the
suggestion that the de facto govern
ment, which owns the controllns- stock
of the road, permit the use of the lin
in accordance with the request.
State department officials wre In
formed today by counsel for Carranza
that the request, in all probability, will
be granted. Only one condition, it was
said, might prevent the de facto gov
ernment from acceding to the request,
that being the uncertainty Of publlo
opinion in Mexico as to the use of the
roads by the American army.
Won't Take Cnaaa Grandes Town.
American troops pursuing Villa and
his bandits have no intention and n-
orders to occupy any cities or towns
during their march Into Mexico.
This was stated at the white house
and war department today after the
receipt of a report that Gen. Gabriel
Gavira. the Carranza commander at
Juarez, had given notice that Gen.
Pershing's troops would not be al
allowed to tccupy Casas Grandes, or
other towns.
o Object In Ocr pylng Town.
It was declared by administration
officials that the pursuit of Villa, be
ing entl'ely a punitive expedition, had
nono of the characteristics of an in
vasion and that thera was no objei t
in occupying towns or cities, because
the American troops will keep con
stantly on the move.
Officials said oday that the situation
at Tampico, where uneasiness is said
to exist among Americans and other
foreigners, bad no bearing on the pur
suit of Villa.
Reports rece ved at both the tth"
and state departments today contin
ued to be optimistic ,
AMERICAN cavalrymen were
camped at dawn today at Cos
Ionia Dublan. one of the en
virons of Casas Grandes. They ar
rived in the night. Through Colonia
Dublan runs the road to the Galeana
district, 25 miles southeast, where
Villa was last definitely reported
The Pershing column, moving slow
er, had not reached Dublan today. It
was the cavalry column, from Uachlta
that reached Dublan.
Tho news of the encampment at Co
lonia Dublan dispelled fears of any
disputes with Constitutionalist autho
