In addition to serving as milk in

Some man who refused to give his
name, called in about the shirt worn
by a certain grocerman in Topeka.
"I am one of the best customers he
has," said the man, "and I want to
continue to trade there. But this
man's shirt is a fright. I don't think
he changes it at all. I believe that in
inspecting grocery stores you should
take such things into consideration."
The soiled shirt will be taken into

there is no further need to fear tdou

General Gaxira. "and I feel much re

serious for a while. The Carranza

ably seconded by his generals in the

Confidence in First Chief.
'I do not wish to be understood as
in any way approving the entry of
American troops on Mexican soil. The
restraint that the Mexican people lavs
shown is due solely to the confidence
that they have in the first chief and

passage of their soldiers over so large
a part of Mexico without being mo
lested in any way. It is a supreme
tribu te to General "arranze. "

he had received word that General

He said he knew nothing further of J

ISSUE PEACE DEFli
German Officials Supposed Baek
of Editorial.
Didn't Make Terms, Now Must
Suffer.
Berlin, March 1 8. Germany's ene
mies, by not taking advantage of the
announcement of Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg on December 9
that Germany would consider peace
proposals whenever her foes are will
ing to ask terms, have lost the day of
grace. This is the conclusion to be
drawn from a leading article in the
semi-official Lokal Anzeiger in which
it is declared flatly the time now has
come to carry out the chancellor's
warning of December that if the ene
mies of this country did not ask for
peace in a reasonable period they
would have to pay more dearly for it.
Were Willing Then,
The Lokal Anzeiger says:
"According to everything one hears,
one must be convinced that our re
snopsible statement in complete agree
ment with the military leaders now
occupy a different attitude toward the
general situation than they occupied
when the chancellor expressed our
readiness to enter into peace negotia
tions under certain conditions. These
remarks uttered with a feeling of
power and a certain superiority but
in no manner of weakness, found a
fanatical echo among our enemies.
"Hence, every one has to conclude
that the leaders in the enemy camp
lack all vision of the attainable, all
understanding of the hard immutable
facts which already had developed
and have since that time only accum
ulated in greater extent.
"The chancellor left no doubt that,
if his honorable wish to avoid sense
less blood letting should prove futile
we were determined to double our
energies in order to open the blindest
of our enemies eves."

der General Pershing, and the other
from Hachita, N M.. under Colonel
Dodd, had gotten into close communi
cation with each other and probably
had formed an actual junction when
a little more than half way on the
route to Casas Grandes. Something of
the strategy of the dash on Villa's
trail was revealed. The Hachita
column made its actual start from San
Bernardino ranoh, about the size of a
large county, where the state of New
Mexico extends some forty miles
south of the general east and west line
of the American border.
Didn't Stop at Guzman.
By using this American territory for
the first part of their advance from
Hachita, the flying cavalry command
of Col. George Dodd. was able to
strike into Mexico at the shortest dis
tance from Casas Grandes, a little
more than 60 miles of march.
The main column, under General
Pershing, at Columbus, N. M.. starting
at a point considerably farther north
of Casas Grandes, did not go due south
but apparently veered to the westward
to get into touch with the cavalry
commands from Hachita,
