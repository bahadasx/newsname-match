Cemetery Fence Completed
The fence around the cemetery
which is of cemnent block pillars
and large iron tubes was comnple
ted this week, and our people can
feel proud of this accomplishment,
because it is one that is certainly
to the credit of the people of the
town, and Father Tr(,toux who has
taken the lead in this worthy
cause, with the assistance of Mr.
i). E. Duchamip and Mr. Evalture
Bonin who has made the cement
work. It is really fine work.
Fine Weather For Crops.
The weather was ideal this week,
a little cool in the morning, but
warm during the day, the farmers
are hard at work, but would need
some rain. They are through with
the cane since several weeks and
this crop is growing nicely. The
planters will be through planting
corn shortly, some is coming up
already. The rice planters are all
plauting and with continued tavo
rable weather will soon be through.
All planters report condition very
favorable with them.

INOCULATE CATTLE TO
PREVENT CHARBON
A warning has been issued by
Dr. E. P. Flower, direector of the
State Live Stock. Sanitary Board,
to Louisiana farmers, instructing
them to immediately inoculate
their cattle against a recurrance of
charbon. There was considerable
charbon in the State last year, and
Dr. Flower states the only way to
stamp out the disease is by imme
diate inoculation.
We make special study of diag
nostic methods both laboratory and
clinical (physical,) especially as
an aid to the general practitioner,
we therefore, accept no general
case, unless the attending physi
cian go on a strike and leave his
patient to the ravages of the dis
ease, then we back our hand.
Our prices are within the reach
of everyone, we say this to discre
dit the rumors of the exorbitant
charges accredited to us. If you
doubt this c,.me and get your in
formation from us, instead of get.
ting it second-hand or fr ,m solll
onie who may have an ax to grind.
The following has been printed
on our price list since we started
working here: "lWhenever patients
are unable to pay, or are strictly
charity patients. any reduction re.
quested by the physician or clergy
man, will be made. This rule,
however, um ust not be abuse(l.
