Judge Dubuison's Dilemma.
Judge E. B. Dubuisson of St.
Landry, nominated for attorney
general on Mr. Parker's mongrel
political ticket because the Dem
ocratic candidate for attorney
general, Judge A. V. Coco, had
the hardihood to criticise Mr.
Parker's politics in both French
and English, has discovered that
he occupies an anomalous posi
tion as the anointed of Mr. Park
er's self-instituted "convention."
Under the law Judge Dubuisson
is prohibited from becoming a
candidate for attorney general in
Mr. Parker's party, whatever
tHat party happens to be, be
cause only six weeks ago he vot
ed in the Democratic primary.
It was to "my life-long friend,
Dubuisson," that Mr. Parker
turned the other day at Eunice
when he was asked the point
blank question by Mr. James J.
Lewis whether or not he consid
ered it honorable for a Democrat
voting for either Mr. Barret or
Col. Pleasant in the primary to
vote for him in the general elec
tion. Judge Dubuisson was ready
with a long legal opinion as to
the right of a voter in the pri
mary, under the law, to disre
gard the primary results and vote
as he might deem fit in the gen
eral election. This, of course,
didn't answer Mr. Lewis' ques
tion, for the simple reason that
everybody knows it is not a mat
ter of law, but of honor and mor
Mr. Lewis didn't ask Mr.
it was LAWFUL to
knife th e of a primary
in which one h icipated,
but if it was HONO to
do so. Mr. Parker dodged and
Judge Dubuisson evaded the is
sue.
Farm and Home Study Clubs.
Tie extension Division of the
Louisiana State University is
sending out the following circu
lar letter to the farmers, to
which we call special attention
and hope a number of our pro
gressive farmers will take ad
vantage of the offer, viz:
In order to improve farm con
ditions and present methods of
farming we have decided" to or
ganize Farm and Home Study
Clubs in every community for the
benefit of all who desire to carry
a special line of reading, experi
mentation and investigation un
der the direction of the director
of the experiment station, the
State agent, the supervisor of
farm and home study clubs, the
specialists of the U. S. depart
ment of agriculture and the mem
bers.of the University faculty.
It will be the purpose of the
Farm and Home Study Clubs to
make a thorough and careful
study of soils, soil formation, soil
types, and soil improvement;
crops and crop rotations; live
stock, livestock farming, feeding,
dairying and poultry- farming;
orchading and gardening; eco
notnic farm problems; the farm
home and its scientific manage
ment.

Application for Enrollment as a Member of the Farm Study Clubs
To JOHN W. WILKINSON, Supervisor Farm Study Clubs,
University Station, Baton Rouge, La.,
I hereby make application for enrollment as a member of the
farm and Home Study Club and desire to take a special course of
reading and investigation in the following subjects:
Name of work desired .................................. ........

Now it transpires that while
Judge Dubuisson was armed with
a learned disquisition upon the
legal status of the voter who had
taken part in the Democratic
primary, he was in absolute ig
norance of his own status as a
candidate before the people. He
knew that the voter who had
taken part in a primary could le
gally bolt the nominees in the en
suing election, but he didn't
know that one who had voted in
the vrimary could not become a
candidate for office of an oppos
ing party in the election.
The only difference between
Judge Dubuisson and the aver
age voter who participated in the
primary of January 25 is that
Judge Dubuisson is forbidden by
law from playing the part of
traitot to the nominees of that
primary, while the law leaves
this question to the conscience
and sense of honor of the aver
age voter. The principle involv
ed is exactly the same.
Here the trite expression ap
plies very forcibly. Mr. Parker
and' his candidate for attorney
general are "hoist by their own
petard."--Shreveport Times.
Watch Child's Cough.
Cold4 running of nose, continued ir
ritation of the mucous membrane if
neglected may mean catarrh later.
Don't take the chances, do something
for your child! Children will not take
every medicink, but they will take Dr.
King's New Discovery and without
bribing or teasing. Its a sweet pleas
ant tar syrup and so effective. Just
laxative enough to eliminate the waste
poisons. Almost the first dose helps
Always prepared, no mixing or fussing.
Just ask your druggist for Dr. King's
New Discovery. It will safeguard
your child against serious ailments re
sulting from colds. -Adv.-2.

such analyses of soils and crops
as may be necessary in each in
dividual case, and will direct the
members of the Farm and Home
Study Clubs to such bulletins and
and reading matter as will show
the results of research and ob
servation on the problemls under
study, and by correspondence
will place them in communication
with specialists who will supply
any additional information that
may be needed.
Please urgeyour farmer friends
to take up this work and if it ap
peals to you let us enroll you

A Mother's Gratitude
Many a Mother in Colfax ill Appre
deate the Following.
Many a strong man and many a
healthy woman has much for which to 1
thank mother. The care taken dnring i
t their childhood broughCthem past the
danger point and made them healthy
men and women. Thousands of chil
' dren are bothered with incontinence of
urine, and inability to retain it is oft
times called a habit It is not always
the children's fault, in many cases the
difficu!tv lies with the kidneys, and can
S be readily righted. A Colfax mother
tells how she went about it.
Mrs. E. C. Hicks, Colfax, La., says:
"Doan's Kidney Pills are a good reme
dy for kidney trouble. I gave them to
my ittle boy who had no control over
the kidney secretions. One bo; cured
him and his health is now good. It is
a pleasure to recommend a remedy of
such merit."
Price 56c at all dealers. Don't simp
ly ask for a kidney remedy-get Doan's
'Kidney Pills-the same that Mrs. E. C.
Hicks had. Foster-MilburnCo., Props.
