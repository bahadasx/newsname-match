SALVATION ARMY ABOLISHES
BREAD LINE IN NEW YORK
Because Men in Line Refused to
Work for Good Wages.
New York,' March, IT. The Salva
tion Army's famous " bread ' iine in
Cooper Square will be abolished, it
was announced today, because the
army has .'become convinced that the
men who compose it are- beggars who
do not wish to work. An officer of
the army accompanied by a civilian
employe of the police department in
charge of the bureau of the unemploy
ment, offered work today at wages
ranging from $1 to $3 a day to men in
bread lines in all parts of the city,
but were unable to find one who would
accept a job. They have applications
from outside the city for more than
300 workers.
Investigation has disclosed that all
the bread lines are composed of virt
ually the same men who go from one
to the other and spend the intervals
in public libraries. They refuse to
work on the ground that they are
physically unfit for manual labor.
Charity officials are said to be con
vinced that no man in New York need
be out of employment If he is willing
and able to work.

Fired on American Troops.
. Washington, March 17. The main
American expeditionary force in Mex
ico as late as this afternoon had en
countered none of Villa's outlaws. Re
ports to this effect were received by

messages Telayed by telegraph from a
point along the international border.

as clearly indicating that Villa and
his bandits were fleeing before the
American advance and that it was ex
tremely doubtful that they would at
tempt to make a -stand. The opinion
prevailed among army officers that the
campaign would develop quickly into a
guerma warrare, lr any opposition at

TRYING TO SAVE AMERICANS
lose Pereya Stepped in Front of Wo
men as Bandits Rushed In.
EI Paso, March 18. Jose Pereya,
Carranza consul at Columbus, who was
killed by the Villa raiders, met death
trying to save the lives of American
women, according to a story told hers
today by Mrs. W. L. Ritchie. Mrs.
Ritchie's husband ran a hotel at Co
lumbus and was shot to death before
her eyes by the Villa raiders.
"When the bandits broke into the
hotel," she said, "I and my daughtei
and seme other women ran into the
corridor from our bedrooms. We were
joined by Pereyra, who stepped in
front of us, as the Villa men rushed
up the stairs and called out:
" 'Don't shoot we are all Mexicans
here.' The bandits seized the women
and dragged them onto the light one
by one, saying each time to Pereyra:
"'Is this one a Mexican?"
"Pereyra bravely insisted we were
and should not be molested but It was
easy for the murderers to see he was
lying. The American soldiers were
coming up and the raiders fled, but
they dragged Pereyra with them,
kicking and abusing him. As his
body was found some distane over the
border I suppose they first intended
to make him a prisoner, but when
the pursuit of the Americans beamt
too hot they shot him down and left
him lying in the brush."

Taff Pays High
Tribute to Irish

Says They Have Softened American

Ever Ready to Respond to Call.

Excells as a Business Developer
The basic purpose of extensive advertising Is to accomplish wider
distribution. This means that the stores which advertise recognize
the importance of letting the purchasing public know that they are
doing business every day, that they have the goods which will meet
the requirements of the people and that they are desirous of filling the
wants. They know that the time has gone by when business houses
can expect to build up a profitable trade by simply placing a horse
shoe over the door. It is contrary to the experience of all successful
.merchants to entertain the Idea that business can be developed, and a
greater distribution of goods secured without the use of printer's ink.
And when it comes to advertising there Is nothing which equals
the value of the newspaper. It is thorougli. far-reaching and constant
when It possesses the circulation which fully covers its field in the
manner In which The Bulletin does. It is such service which assures
economy and efficiency to- the advertiser.
For the past week the following matter has appeared in its col
umns all of which is delivered at your door for twelve cents a week:

made from various European stocks.
They have softened the American wtt.
They have added to Amerlcqp tender
ness. They have increased the spirit
of good fellowship, added to our op
timistic and added to our sunny phil
osophy. Anarchy Foreign to Them.
"Socialism and anarchy have found
no lodgement among Irishmen. They
believe in institutions of modern so
ciety. They believe in upholding our
national and our state governments.
They believe in the preservation of
checks nd balances of our constitution
al structure.
Recognize Value of Liberty.
'They welcome progress. They are
not full of dintrihes against the exist
ing order. They struggle for equality
of opportunity and recognize the value
of liberty offered by law. They are
not reaching out for new Gods of gov
ernment. They are not seeking to
invent a new society and turn the
present one topsy-turvy.
Will Fight For Government.
"They are operating in full spirit
of the' civilization, the good fortune,
the prosperity and the happiness that
Is possible under our American gov

they value it. they will fight to pre
serve it."
Among the guests at the banquet
were Archbishop Mundelein and Ed

It was estimated that Colonel Dodd.
who crossed the international boundary
line at 1 o'clock Thursday morning,
45 miles from iiachiia, N". M., tonight
was close by, if not actually in touch
witn, the heavier and slower column
led in Wednesday by General Pershing.
it was intended that the more mobile
force of Colonel Dodd should effect a
juncture with the first column, after
which Colonel Ootids cavalry would be
sent on reconnaissance, utilizing also
the services of Ameru-an cowboys wro
have joined the column together with
other scouts.
The actual news coming from the
forces "somewhere In northern Mexi
co" was unexciting and not illumina
tive as to Villa's exact whereabouts,
but not even this news was made pub
lic by General Funston. He is con
sistently adhering to his policy of not
permitting the details of the expedition
to become common knowledge.
Wireless and Courier Communication,
General Pershing continued to hold
his line of communication today, re
porting at intervals as to his position
and the state of his troops. His wire
less was used and couriers to the bor
der brought more detailed information.
The direct wire from the border car
ried the mersages to General Funston's
headquarters. It was said today that
General Pershing probably would sup
plement his field lines of communica
tion with a telephone wire which would
be extended as he proceeded.
Now in Desolate Country.
Failure of any body of Mexicans to
oppose the Americans and reports that
General Calles was using his men to
lurtify tne pusses which lead the way
from the state of Chihuahua Into the
state of Sonora served to diepel some
what the reeling common in many
quarters that not all the Carranza
garrisons would co-operate in the
chase of Villa. It was nointed out.
however, that the country through
which the troops are now moving is
so desolate and almost uninhabited
that attack either by Villa or by in
subordinate government troops would
occasion no surprise.
Villas Exact Whereabouts Not Known.
For no reason ascertainable there
prevails a belief that an encounter
with Villa is not probable for some
days. His exact whereabouts is not
known, but he is believed by most per
sons to be in the mountains not far
from the Casas Grandes district, tow
ard which the Americans are moving,
and against which the Carranza col
umns are said to be directed from
other directions.
CAVALRY DETACHMENTS
