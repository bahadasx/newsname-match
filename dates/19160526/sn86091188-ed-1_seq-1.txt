tains and Commissary for June 8
The thoroughness with which the

the other generals associated with
him have selected captains to have
charge over tens and fifties and these
are organizing all down the line,
wittr assigned duties in special sec
tions of road to look after and re
pair. General O'Brien expects from
Salmon alone no less than 300 men
and teams. It is the best sort of
patrotic work in which tue volun
teers are enlisting.
At the directors' room of the Pio
neer bank on Saturday last the spec
ial Good Roads committee net in
joint sesssion with the general com-!
ruittee named by the county, and at j
Warners'— j
that meeting selected captains for the
