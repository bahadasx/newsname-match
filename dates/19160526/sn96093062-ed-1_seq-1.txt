WILL NOMINATE
COUNTY TICKET
Republicans Resent Charged That
They Will Fromo Up With Social,
ists in Attempt to Carry County
In General Election.
Prominont republicans of tho
county appear to resent the charges
that havo been mado, that they plan
ned a frame up with the Socialists
of tho county for the purpose of car-
rylng the county at tho general elec
tion In November. Pursuant to call'
of tho. county organization tho coun
ty convention of tho Republican
iarty Is In session In this city aa
the News goes to press, and It Is tho
avowed Intention of the leadors of
the party to nomlnato an entira
county ticket for presentation to tho
voters this fall.
Tho charge that was formerly
mado agains tho party was that
they would nominate candidates for
county attorney and county Judgo
and Ignore the other offices. Then
tho Socialists would nomlnato candi
dates for allot her county offices,
ignoring the offices of county at
torney and county Judgo. At tho
election, eveiy socialist and every
Republican would voto for tho Re
publican and Socialist nominees
alike, giving each nominee on both,
tickets the full strength of tho com
bined parties. This sort of deal is
emphatically denied by Republican
leaders.
The Socialist party likewise ex
pects to have a full county ticket In
tho field according to information
received by tho Nows.
BOB LEMON IN RACE FOR
. COUNTY COMRHSSIONER.
The News' announcement column
this weok carries the card of R. B.
Lemon ofAchllle who aspires to be
come county commissioner of Bryan
county from the second district sub
ject to the Democratic primary to ba
hold on August first this year.
Bob Lemon is one of Bryan Coun
tys' best known and' most influential
citizens. For years and years he has
lived In the community which now
is called Achllle and any Introduc
tion at the hands of this writer la
unnecessary and superfluous.
Bob Lemon is a man of large
means and Is a success at his busi
ness of farming. He and his friends
believe .he has the qualifications ne
cessary to the making of an efficient
county commissioner and he promis
es those who may, support him In his
race, careful attention to duty and
tho application of common sense
business principles to the county's
affairs If he Is elected.
boy Scouts make
selves useful.
' "If I had a boy I'd mako him a
boy scout," Is the way a budlness
man expressed his appreciation of
the scouts this week when he saw
them helping to get the visiting Nor
mal f-tuilonts located, carrying their
luggage and directing them to whers
they v. anted to go. The divisions of
the scouts numbering the larger
boya. volunteered their services, and
met all trains and took the vlaltlng
norniulistets in charge. Perhaps two
dozen of them were thus engaged
and their services proved a great
aid.
DEVICE TO PREVENT
RUNAWAYS.
U. G. Phlppen who recently locat
ed In Durant, coming from Hugo,
has a patented device which when
attached to a vehlclo, will he says
make It impossible for the team
drawing the vehicle to run away
with it.
He claims that the team can not
go forward or turn to either side
when this device Is In gear. It can
be easily and quickly worked by the
driver with a hand lever or a tooC
lever, or can be operated by any per
son on the ground by pulling a strap
which hangs at tho rear end of tho
vehicle box. With the device In gear
tho team may, with absolute safety
bo left standing hitched to tho wag
on at any place.
TAKING VIEW OF DURANT.
T. H. Jeffords, Industrial agent
of the M. K. & T. Ry. Co. was here
this weok taking views of street
scenes, school buildings and so forth,
which will bo placed In the Kayt'a
album of vlows of eastern Oklahoma,
which are shown to prospectlvo 1ml
migrants to this country.
