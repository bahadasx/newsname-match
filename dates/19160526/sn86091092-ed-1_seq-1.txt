PEOPLE OF CALDWELL ARE
INVITED TO HEAR DAVIS
Candidate for Governor Will Speak
Monday Evening at City Hall.
Senator I). W. Davis, candidate for
governor, will address the people of
Caldwell at the City Hall. Monday
evening. May 29th. Senator Davis is
said to be a forceful, impressive speak
er. He has given the affairs with
which he will deal much thought and
study. The address will be welt worth
hearing.
Senator Davis believes that if the
resources of the state of Idaho are
handled in a business-like manner that
Idaho can be made taxless within a
reasonable length of time. His scheme
will be fully unfolded in his address.
The subject is of vital interest to every
taxpayer of the state irrespective of
his political affiliations.
Candidate's Position.
Senator Davis thus states his posi
tion:
"I stand firmly on the proposition
of so handling our resources as to se
cure an immediate and increasing re
duction of tax burdens, and the crea
tion of a fund which in time will pro
vide sufficient revenue to free us from
taxation entirely. We are using not to
exceed one-fifth of our capital. By
putting the other four-fifths at work
we can produce a great revenue, and
by usng a part of this revenue bring
about immediate relief. By adding
the unused earnings to capital and re
investing them we can within a rea
sonable length of time have a fund
great enough to produce sufficient rev
enue to meet all the expenses of gov
ernment."
Ladies are cordially invited.

FIRST FACTORY DAY IN
CALDWELL WAS A
GREAT SUCCESS
Caldwell's first F'actory Day observ
ed Tuesday under the auspices of the
Commercial club, was one of the most
successful events in the industrial his
tory of Caldwell and will prove of
lasting benefit to the different enter
prises of the city. From the departure
of the business men at 2:30 on the in
spection tour until the final toast at
tlie home products dinner in the even
ing every moment was instructive and
entertaining for the participants and
it was the generally expressed wish
that the event be made an annual one.
The trip of inspection was a revela
tion to all. Every institution visited
displayed evidence of a healthy, sub
stantial growth and the management
in every case was optimistic regarding
tile future. At all places the visitors
were welcomed heartily and shown
through the establishments by the em
ployers. In the larger places special
facilities were accorded the visiting
delegation enabling it to view the con
version of the raw product to the fin
ished article.
A total of 26 places with an aggre
gate annual payroll estimated at $350,
000 were visited during the afternoon.
But one regret was voiced at each
place. With the large number of
places scheduled to be inspected the
ingenuity of the itinerary committee
was taxed to provide even a brief stop
at each. It w r as even necessary
omit several institutions not directly
on the route.
The party started at 2:30 visiting
the Harding Cement works, where a
five minute stop was made. Adjourn
ing to the Electric Bakery, F'rank
Weaver's, the Duncan Machine Shop.
Hall Fly Swat factory, Co-Operative
Creamery, Shank Auto Co., S. J
Grimmitt and Fred Goette place
which were inspected in the order
named.
At the Hazelwood, the next stop
pleasant surprise awaited the p^rty
Manager Blunt and a corps of assist
ants served delicious Hazelwood ice
cream with Hazelwood cheese for
"chaser." F'or the benefit of the vis
itors a demonstration of buttermaking
was given accompanied by a brief talk
on the growth of the dairy industry in
the Boise valley by Mr. Blunt
count of the machines parked about
the creamery disclosed 30, carrying
a
of
1'.
J.
approximately 150 passengers.
The reception at the Caldwell Ice &
Cold Storage belied its name for th
visitors were warmly received.
One of the interesting stops of the
trip was the Caxtons, said to be the
most completely equipped general job
printing establishment in the state
With all machinery running unde
competent operators the intricacies of
modern "print shop" was demon
strated to the thoroughly interested
crowd. The different processes were
explained by Manager Gipson, wli
presented each visitor with a hand
some couvenir.
At the Troy laundry the visitors
were met by IÎ. A. Wheeler who ex
patiated on that well known axiom
"Cleanliness is next to Godliness."
An instructive 15 minutes was spent
at the Caldwell Mill & Elevator com
pany where the visitors escorted good
Canyon county wheat through the dif
ferent processes leaving it safely
a Wigwam flour sack.
Stops at the Idaho Milling company
Caldwell Planing Mill, Gordon &
Adams and the Shirks Carpet factory
occupied the next 20 minutes. Past
the site of the Odd Fellows Home th
party arrived at the Union Stock yards
operated bv the Caldwell Horse &
Mule company, which was given a
thorough inspection.
The magnitude of the business and
its importance to the city was strik
ingly brought to the attention of the
visitors by the following figures sub
mitted by Col. Amos J. Miller.
Since November 1914 the company
has paid approximately $3,IXX),000 for
horses and has handled approximately
30,(XK) head. During the same period
$60,000 has been expended for hay
and $40,000 for labor. From 10 to 15
men are employed at the yards con
stantly and from 12 to 15 buyers arc
employed. Monthly auction sales are
held on the first Tuesday and Wednes
day and inspections for army steeds
several times each month. Approxi
mately 1,000 animals are kept on hand
at all times. The work of Carl Huff
yard manager was highly compliment
ed by Col. Miller.
Following the bell wether the party
circled through the College of Idaho
grounds aptly termed by one of the
members as Caldwell's "brain factory.'
Stops at the Caldwell Cigar factory.
Caldwell Tribune, Curtis & Beal,
Pickard & Roberts, Caldwell News
City Bakery and the Colonial Bottling
& Candy works concluded the itiner
ary, the last place being visited at 6
o'clock.
The crowning event of the day was
the goodfellowship banquet of Canyon
county products served in the base
me.nt of the M. E. church in the even
ing, More than 140 people gathered
at the banquet tables and all declared
that it was the most successful event
of its kind in the history of the city.
Plenty of excellently prepared food,
good music bv the Municipal orches
tra and sparkling oratory contributed
to a most pleasurable evening.
The general sentiment expressed by
the speakers was that a closer co-op
eration should prevail among the
towns and cities of Canyon county and
that the slogan "Idaho Products for
Idaho People" be not only adopted
but practiced whenever practical.
Out-of-town guests who spoke for
m ire united effort for the upbuilding
of the best state in the northwest and
the best county in the state included
1'. Monroe Smock of New Plymouth;
"resident N'ed Jenness and Secretary
J. A. Lakness of the X a in pa Cominer
ial club and J. 11. Lowell of Roswell.

ments who responded to Toastmaster
lolt's call included C. S. Doan, E. II
Plow-head, Amos J. Miller, Rev. Mr.
mce, W. P. Lyon, W. 11. Blount, T.
\. Walters and William March.
\ clever vaudeville skit entitled
Grin & Bearit spontaneously staged
by Toastmaster Holt and Dr. F'. M.
Cole was one of the big hits of the
veiling.
"The splendid co-operation given
the committee by the citizens was ex
remely gratifying and was the prime
factor in making Caldwell's first Fac
tory Day a complete success, and I
desire at this time to express the deep
ppreciation of tile committee in
charge of the event for the loyal sup
port given," declared Dr. F. M. Cole,
hairman of the. Commercial club com
mittee. "I believe that the club has
inaugurated a movement which will
prove beneficial to not only the manu
facturers but to the entire citizenship
as well, and I hope to see it become
an annual event growing i'l import
ance with each succeeding year," he
added.
