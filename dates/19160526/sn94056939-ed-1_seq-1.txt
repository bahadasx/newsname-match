of tho social ser vico plans of tho
lumber manufacturers The iifsoc

Ha plans for pushing this now do
partment of public servico by netu
ally nssisting tho schools of the
nation to build homes for teachers
but work on tlds phllnnthropi
enterprisa is already under way
und tho ossoelation plans to have
Uh plans ready for announcement in
n few weeks.
ilie plan to spread tlio gospel o
homes for school tunohors over tlio
'and was first broached only n few
weeks ago at u conference of tlio
directors of the association. It
proved instantly popular. The
idea was taken Up by tlio United
States Durcati of Education, and
tlio first result of this ennperutlnn
between the lumbormcn of the
nation and tlio government itself is
in tho issunnco of a brochure entitled
'"IVaohcrs' Cottages," by it.
Kcllog of Chicago, secretary of the
National Lumbar Manufacturers
association, in cooperation with tho
United States Bureau of Education
und which is being sont to over.y
county supciiuteiidnnt of schools in
America. The Rockefeller Founda
tion lias air only approved of the
plan and is giving S25, ()()() to foster
this work with more money to
nomo.
The proposul to build these
touchers' cottages all over the land
follows out tho idea thai has already
been carried into extensivo success
by the state of Washington.
The national association has tak
en up this social servico work in the
belief that the education of the nu
don will tie immensely advanced if
thu teachers of the nation's young
nie properly housed. The theory is
that if luaehcrs are provided with
proper homes, the country dis
tricts villi bo able to Beouro better
teachers, avoid tho constant changes
by which tlio schools am always in
a torn up condition. As Secretary
Kcllog phrases it in his work, which
constitutes a survey of the move
luont and Its possibilities:
"Under present ciroumslancos,
tho teaching of a country school ufen
becomoi t Imply n temporary exped
ient for the teachef tho first tirm
after Retting a certificate, and
ambitious teachers who are anxious
to grow In tholr profession, and
make something of themselves, go
to the city schools just as soon as
possible, where living conditions nrn
better. Tho country schools are
always left witli the largest prnpor
tiou of young, inexpciicnccd, poorly
indued teachers.
Mr. Kollog urges also that the
teachers' cottages, or n? ho calls
them, tenehoinges. should be mod
els of sanitation, artistic, though
inexpensive and so constructed
that thoy may be tint only homes
hut real social centers for the rural
neighborhoods.
In order to further this plan of
properly caring for tlio teachers,
the lumbermen's organization is
ready In preparo plans In assist
rural communities in providing
their teachers with tlio kind of
homes which have proved satisfnc
toiy in Washinelon and in the
other more scattered localities
where they have been built
new Mexico tins noon seleelod us
one ol the first slntcs for tho gnner
si introduction of this idea of i
teachers b cottage fur every rural
school, because of tho special needs
ol this stale for rural odiieullon.
"Ono piase is trying the teacher s
cnitnge plan this venr. It ta
serious problem in this State in
many districts," .savs tho U. 8
Dureau of Education report.

diet.
Tho cubo was brought hero on
nhango of vontie from Torrance
County whero the killing took

Tho stale h being reprisenled by
District Attorney Ii It. Hamilton
and is assisted by Judge V. V
(lalewood-of Hnswell, while the
dofencu is being conducted by Col
tico W. Pilchard of Satitu Fn.
This esse grew nut of a disputo
arising bel ween Kimmons and
Drown over n fence linn along
which the deewtsod had workmen
chopping wood.
According lo the testimony of T
W. Allen, the only cyo wIiiicm to
tlio killing, Kimini'tis and his wife
catuc to Ilia point of the killini!.
Mrs Kimmons with a flint gun and
her husband armed with a mvnlver
and were- talking In Aileu about
being over tho linn win ii itniwti
name up. uciiicn argument was
engaged in and ihe killing followed
In nililllinti In AMen the stole
used Mr. Mnrblo n surveyor, as
witness. A very thorough account
of the detain of the oa-e leadlnu
up In the killing was giwtn by
Allen.

tho inlrnduciion of witnesses and
nlnls as to I bu dllTerent lines In
uucstlon, ntitl especially the one In
controversy between tho iraets of!
Drown and Kimumns, after which
the defendant wits placed upon tho
stand und gave his version nf lliu
difficulties leading up lo the killing
and his oonveisuliuu and thnt nf
Drown ut the tlmn Immediately be
fore the fatal shooting. His testi
mony contradicted that uf the
witness, Allen, in several material
instances, regarding the distances
nf the different parties at tho time
of the shooting, und the positions
relatively of Drown and Kimmons
just before and at tho timo the
shots were fired. Kimmons tei
liud that Ihe deceased, wad wl1 n
about three Bteps with the n
ed nbnve his head and euro ,.
him rapidly when he shot af.. .i kill
Drown; and on being interrogated
by his counsel as to why he shot,
stated that ho was afraid ho would
be cut down or killed by Drown
with that axe. us ho hud it drawn
nnd was coming ut him when he
fired to save himself from being
killed This plea of self-dofenco
Iim been indicated throughout the
i.trial in the cross examination uf the
slate's witnesses bv counsel for de
fence; and, of cnttr-c, made more
forceful by direct examination of
the defendant und his wifo, who
woro also present at the time of tho
shooting.
The defendant's wife testified
and substantiated her husband's
testimony in must instances; how
ever, being slightly different with
regard to tlio positions and distan
ees of tlio several prrsuns ut the
timo tlio shoiH were fired.
It is t tin s'nto's contention that
Drown was 10 5 feet from Jibnmnus
when the shot was firíd, and Hint
the axo was in Drown's left hand
with the hlndu resting upon tho
ground. That is so test Hied to by
Allen, which is controverted by
both tho defendant and his wife,
wlin both put Drown within HI to
12 feel of Kimmons and both slate
that the ax was raised or drawn lo
n position above tlio shoulder nnd
that he was making toward Kim
mons in Hint altitude wlirn Kim
mons fired
