MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS uON

TICE HUGHES.
Chicago, May 25. The Washington
correspondent of the Chicago Tribune,
Arthur Sears Hennin, says that the
old guard republicans were the recip
ients of much sympathy today and
for the first time a number of them
were willing to concede they are en
titled to it. Just when they were
settling down comfortably to the con
viction that the remarkable develop
ment of the Hughes boom had put the
quietus on Colonel Roosevelt's ambi
tions, along came a disturbing re
vival of the Roosevelt movement.
Just when it appeared certain that
only Hughes stood between the old
guard and its heart's desire, the
eastern leaders woke up to the fact
that they have a bigger job on their

hands than they had contracted to
handle. What with the delegates
who favor Hughes and the delegates
wiio are for Roosevelt, openly or se
cretly, an ovi rwhelming majority
of the convention stands for men
the old guard must eliminate before
it gets the man it wants.
Old Guard Faces Dilemma.
The old guard now faces the prob
ability that, if Hushes should with
draw, Roosevelt stock would take a
skyward leap, and that, if Roosevelt
be effectually eliminated, the nomi
nation of .Hughes will approach close
to a certainty.
Since the Koosevelt boom got its
second wind the eastern leaders are
beginning to look on Hughes as a
life-saver, much as they dislike- him.
With the progressive nomination as
sured, Roosevelt, it is foreseen,
might be a formidable antagonist
should Justice Hughes suddenly
knock the props from under his own
bcom.
Hope Hughes Will Outlast T. R.
Hence sundry republican politicians
of the old school hereabout are hop
ing Hughes will stay in the race un
til Koosevelt is disposed of and then,
if Hughes will not decently withdraw
the old guard will accept him with
appropriate relief In escaping Roose
velt, but with misgivings of the fu
ture. There has been a' good deal of gos
sip here in the last day or two to the
effect that Justice Hughes does not
intend to allow his name to go before
the convention and has confided to
friends that he regards Colonel
Roosevelt tho logical nominee. AH
of these tales are emphatically de
nied by the Hughes boomers.
Stand of Hughes.
It is asserted by republicans who
profess to know the attitude of Mr.
Hughes that he will not withdraw his
name from consideration by the con
vention unless there should develop
and unseemly struggle for delegates
in which a justice of the supreme
court would be made to appear as a
contestant for the honor.
According to the Hughes men the
justice will utter no word before the
convention meets to indicate whether
he will or will not accept the nomina
tion. His silence will be interpreted
as acquiescence in the program to
hand him the nomination by an over
whelming vote.
Want Hughes or Roosevelt.
Hughes is still far and away the
leading possible nominee, with Roose
velt second. Reports from all over
the country disclose that Hughes and
Roosevelt are the only possibilities
seriously considered by republicans.
The Hughes boomers are more con
fident than ever that the justice will
be nominated on the second or third
ballot, and they are even now talking
of the chance on "putting him over"
on the first ballot. Frank Hitchcock
has a .bunch of southern delegates
and it is said that he intends to
throw them to Hughes on the first
ballot, beginning with Alabama and
Arizona. That is to be the signal
for the rush to Hughes.
Root First Love.
Root is the first love of the old
guardsmen. Those eastern leaders
who occasionally venture west of the
AUeghenies opine that it would be
party suicide to name Root. Cut Bo3s
Barnes and his following are insist
ing on it.
From New York comes the account
of a recent conference of war bride
millionaires with several old guard
leaders at which the munition finan
ciers subscribed a fund of $20,000,000
to be expended in nominating and
electing Root.

ID
CHIEF ENGINEER OF PIONEER
COMPANY ALREADY AT WORK
ON PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS
FOR STRUCTURE.
The Pioneer Telephone Company
have selected the location for the
new $lu(),000 improvement and have
purchased the Cardenhire lot on the
corner cf Droadway and I! street, N.
W.
Plans and specifications for tho now
'building are to he drawn up Immedi
ately and the contract let for the
building.
Less than two weeks ago the Pio
neer Company had their agents W.
H. Kerry and A. T. Saunders circulate
a petition here asking that the ten
per cent discount on telephone bills
ho discontinued and agreed to spend
$100,000 here in improvements, mak
ing the service here the very best that
modern science could install, and to
build their own exchange.
The selection and purchase of the
lot today evidences the good faith of
the company, and there is every
reason to believe that there will be
no delay in the work.
"It. will take almost a year to get
the switchboard," said Mr. Kerry to
day, "and for that reason we could
not lose any time. The plans
and specifications will be drawn
up immediately and the order placed.
Our chief engineer, J. J. Hayes, is
in the city today, already at work
with this end in view. The company
will fulfill every part of the agree
ment to the letter, and as quickly
as possible."
The confidence of the company in
Ardmore is considered a good index
to its future growth ns the plans con
templated are said to provide for a
city much greater than Ardmore is at
present.
