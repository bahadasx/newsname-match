Discredit City Administration.

lie clergymen whose telephone wires
were tapped during the investigation
of charitable institutions took the

part In a conspiracy designed to dis
credit the administration of Catholic

Mitchel, the witnesses protested that
his account of these talks was, in the
main, accurate. They contended that
the language used, much of which was
un grammatical, was not theirs.
Whatever was said in the conver
sations about spiriting witnesses out
of the city to prevent them from ap
pearing before the charities investi
gating - committee was deliberately
planned to delude the mayor and his
associates with the end in view of

In the present cataclysm in human
affairs, when the old order changeth
and the old standards are shatang -upon

reverent memories and calm delibera

need of a burning faith in the eternal
soundness of those ideals and of a toigh
resolve wmt they shall be maintained
at any cost.
On the fourteenth day of June, then,
which the legislature has designated as
FLAG DAY,
I call upon all citizens of the state.

"While the outlook was never more
hopeful, the negro problem is not yet
solved," said Major Moton. "While
there is great encouragement in the
fact that 70 per cent, of the negro
population can read and write, it ns
not safe to assume that 70 per cent,

has been wonderful and we have every

LASTING SETTLEMENT
OF THE IRISH QUESTION.
Demonstration of Unity in . House of
Commons With That Object.
London. May 25. 6.55 p. m. The
house of commons has rarely seen a
demonstration of greater unity than
was displayed this afternoon when the
leaders of all factions flocked to the
standard of the prime minister in an
effort to achieve a lasting settlement
of the Irish questton.
This was the more remarkable be
cause a heated and acrimonious de
bate had "been predicted to follow Pre
mier AsquitOi's expected statement re
garding the situation and tlie govern
ment's proposals for a solution of the
problem. Olr. Asquith's speech took
an unexpected turn, for instead of giv
ing details, he made an earnest plea
ror the settlement of the Irish ques
tion by agreement among the contend
ing parties m Ireland and announced
that David Lloyd George had under
taken the delicate task of bringinjr the
hostile factions together.
The premier concluded with an ap
peal that for a time all debate on the
question, botih In hie house of com
mons and outside, toe suspended, in
view of the adverse effect such argu
ment might have on the difficult un
dertaking lacing the government.
The premiers speech was 'heard with
intense Interest by the members and
he had scarcely resumed his, seat when:
John Redmond 'the nationalist leader,
rost and acquiesced in the' premier's
request, adding, with a voice filled witti
emotion, Hiis ardent desire for a solu
tion of the difficulties of his country.
Mr. Redmond was quickly followed
by hie political arch-enemy; Sir Ed
ward Carsop, who tendered his sup
port to the proposition, and by the in
dependent Irish leader, William
O Brien. who did" likewise.
These speeches effectively obliterat
ed party . lines for the moment and
those members who had come pre
pared to attack the government fell In
with '.he leaders and the question was
dropped. -

FILL SIGNED
In
Giving Sanction, King George la-
sued Message to the Nation. -
Lordon. May 25, 6.30 p. m. The
signature of King George was today
affixed to the military service bill
recently passed by parliament.
In giving the royal sanction to the
bill, Kina George issued the following
message to the nation:
"To enable our country to organize
more effectively Its military resources
in the present great struggle for the
cause of civilization, I have, acting
on the advice of my ministers, deemed
it necessary to enrole every able
bodied man - between the age3 of 18
and 41.
"I desire to take this opportunity of
expressing to my people my recogni
tion, and appreciation of the splendid
patriotism and self-sacrifice they dis
played in raising by voluntary enlist
ment since the commencement of the
war no less than 5,041,000 men an
effect 'far surpassing that of any oth
er nation in similar circumstances
recorded in history and one which will
be a lasting source of pride to fu
ture generations.
" am confident the magnificent spir
it which has hitherto sustained my
people through the trials of this ter
rible war will inspire them to endure
the additional - sacrifice now imposed
upon them and that it will, with God's
help, lead us and our allies ' to a vic
tory which shall achieve the liberation
of Europe."
MEDIATION RESOLUTION
INTRODUCED IN SENATE
Would Authorize President Wilson to
-. Propose a Truce.
Washington, May 25. A resolution
requesting the president, unless In
compatible with the public interest, to
suggest to warring nations of Europe
that the United States undertake me
diation, was introduced in the senate
late today by Senator Lewis of Illi
nois, to lie. on the table for discussion
later.
The result would authorize the pres
ident to propose that the belligerents
declare a truce and that each of them
select a neutral country as its repre
sentative on a board of arbitration
thus created; each selected neutral
would name one member of the board
ovr which the president or his repre
sentative would preside as referee,
Under the plan each belligerent would
present its demands or claims to the
board which would be authorized to
arrive at an equitable adjustment.
The resolution recites that it is sug
gested as an expression of the desire
for world peace and not of favoritism
for any of the belligerents. .
