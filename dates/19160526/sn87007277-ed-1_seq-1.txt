Manager Pat Moran Watching His Star Pitcher Make an Ascension.
Orover Cleveland Alexander, the Phillies' star pitcher and the premier
boxraan of the National league, made his nrst ascension in an aeroplane with
Johnny Green, the aviator, who made the trip across the Lookout Mountains in
Tennessee.
Manager Moran was very reluctant about letting Alexander make the
trip, he does not want his $40,000 star to get the habit of making these aerial
ascensions nor does he want to run the risk of Alexander getting hurt.
Alexander has been priming himself for the season's opening and is In
flns shape. He is confident that he will duplicate his wonderful performance
of last year.

The wonderful all-round. work on the
diamond last season for the St. Louis
Browns by a youne colleelan nm
George Sisler recalls the name of the
great Charles Ferguson, who was
named as the best all-round ball player
me game ever had.
Ferguson made his reputation with
the Philadelphia Nationals during the
late '80's as hurler and general utility
player, and he was cut off right in the
beight of his playing ability and glory
in iss8.
Here is some history about the great
Ferguson and a few records he made
during his short but brilliant career:
Ferguson was secured from' the Vir
ginia club of Richmond, Va in 1883,
and began his work for the Philadel
phia Nationals in the spring of 1884.
That tuam was more or less of a Joke,
but the magnificent work of Ferguson
was a big factor in making it a con
tender for pennant honors In 1886 and
1887, and it was during those seasons
Ferguson made national fame.
Hero is his work for 1887: A per
centage of .728 in games won, a field
ing record of .947 in 25 games at sec
ond and a batting average of .414.
Ferguson could catch a splendid
game, and before going to Phlladolnhla
be was known to go behind the bat
one day and pitch the day following.
In playing second he could cover a
vast amount of territory, was equally
sure on ground and fly bails and a
strong, quick thrower.

Soldiers in Ten Days
Bloody Battle.
DEAD PILED HIGH ON FIELD
'Magnificent, but Criminal," Says Teu
ton Officer, In Describing Ad
vance Made by Slavs In
Face of Certain Death.
By OSWALD F. SCHUETTE.
(Special Correspondent of Chicago
Daily News.)
With Field Marshal von Hinden-
burg's Armies, Near Postawy, Russia
I have come to these blood-drenched
Dattleltolds too late to see the ter
rific assaults of the great Russian of
fensive, so I can only tell the story of
this battle that raged day after day
by picturing the scenes as I find them
and piecing together into one ghastly
mosaic tho fragments of what I am
told. I have talked with officers and
men of the German regiments that
held back the Russian deluge and have
carefully gone over the statements of
the Russian prisoners.
This battlefield consists of an open
glade cut through the Russian prime
val forest. It runs almost due north
and south and varies in width from
400 to 1,500 yards. The Russians
were intrenched alone the eastern
edge of this opening, while the forest
behind offered splendid opportunities
for concealing movements of troops
and emplacements of artillery. The
German lines skirt the western edge
of the flade.
Battle Lasts Ten Days.
The Russian fighting at this point
lasted ten days before the czar's
troops finally gave up their attempt to
break through the German lines. On
the first day the Russian fire was spo
radic, apparently to make certain the
range of the guns. Then for two days
more the Russian bombardment con
tinued, but now it was a real "drum
fire." This means that tho cannonad
ing Is so heavy that it sounds like the
rattle of a drum.
On the afternoon of the third day
the Russian drum fire was suddenly
lifted from the German trenches and
converted into a "sperrfeuer" (curtain
fire) back of the German lines to pre
vent the bringing up of reserves. It
was the signal for a Russian attack.
Out of the foreBt came the storming
Russians straight for the German
lines, straight Into the curtain of Ger
man artillery fire that tore great gaps
in the attacking columns, though these
quickly closed up.
In the meantime the German troops
rushed out of their dugouts into the
water-filled and shell-torn trenches. Al
most in a moment the machine guns
were Jerked out of the bombproof
protection, and after being hastily
mounted on the wreckage of the
breastworks, began to sputter their
fearful greeting to the Russians.
Between the machine guns rattled
the Infantry fire. Thoro was no time
for giving commands and there was
no need of any. There were no vol
leys. Each German soldier fired as
fast as be could. The gaps In the Rus
sian line widened, and then the Rus
sians would halt and fire toward the
German trenches, but it- was bard to
aim, and the bullets scarcely checked
the withering crash of machine gnn
and rifle fire.
Stopped at Barbed Wire.
The Russian wave reached the
barbed wire entanglements before the

has recelvod replies ranging from $800
to $10,000 a year. Most of the girls
were conservative in their demands,
however, and the general average,
based on early replies, is about $1,600.
One girl wrote: "What is money to
me? Give me a true, loving husband
and a cottage."
A large majority of the girls de
manded that their future husbands be
good dancers, some said they must
know the "latest steps" and one went
so far as to say she would marry only
a man who was a "dreamy dancer."
Smoking would be permitted, even
demanded, by a large number ot the
girls, but drinking would be prohibited,
vui those who advocated card playing
German breastworks, but came no far
ther. Torn, beaten and shattered Into
a thousand fragments, the remnants of
the Russian host beat a retreat How
many reached the protection of their
trenches under the unceasing German
fire no one can tell, but the ground be
tween the German and Russian Unas
was covered with' dead and dying.
There was no further attack that
night.
Toward morning the thunder of the
cannon quieted and the cries of the
wounded were almost stilled by day
break. The great battlefield was asleep only
for an hour when the action of the
fourth day began with, another terrific
drum fire, which lasted until long past
noon.
Again the Russian wave broke from
the forests, but it had hardly got out
of the woods before the German
artillery opened Ore. Again shells
tore open the ranks; again the ma
chine guns piled up the dead. The task
was more terrible than on the day be
fore, as the Russians had to storm
over the bodies of their dead com
rades.
Again the night was freezing cold,
again the hours were hideous with the
cries of the dying men out there on
the battlefield and again the darkness
was filled with the thunder of cannon.
To prevent a night attack, the Ger
mans kept up a discharge ot illuminat
ing rockets and a blue-greenish glare
added to the ghastliness of tho field ot
death. But no Russians dared to ad
vance. At daybreak the Russians opened
with a third drum fire. This time it
was more terrible than on the previ
ous occasions, for It was directed not
only on the German trenches, but deep
Into the lines behind them, to hold
back tho reserves and prevent the
bringing up of relief to the half-frozen
German soldiers, who, bundled up,
were standing in the water-filled dug
outs waiting for the attack which they
knew was inevitable. At eight o'clock
the attack came and this time it was
more successful.
Despite the artillery, despite the ma
chine guns and despite the lnfantrv
fire, the apparently inexhaustible regi
ments of Russians swept on over the
dead, over the barbed-wire barriers be
fore the German line, over the first
trenches and routed the German sol
diers, who were half frozen in the mud
of their shattered shelters. A terrific
hand-to-band conflict followed. Hand
grenades tore down scores of defend
ers and assailants alike. The men
fought like maniacs with spades, bay
onets, knives and clubbed guns.
Within 100 Feet of Victory.
But the Russians won at a fearful
price for so slight a gain. It might
have been worth more had the Rus
sian delude swept farther, but it did
not. The Russians stopped within a
hundred feet of victory. It may have
been lack of discipline, lack of officers
or lack ot reserves; no one knows.
The Russians seemed helpless In
the Gorman trench; Instead of sweep
ing on into the second lines they tried
to Intrench themselves In the wrecked
German first line. Immediately Ger
man artillery hurled shells ot the
heaviest caliber into these lines, and
tore them into fragments.
Then came the German reserves, and
by nightfall the Russians had again
been driven out, 800 ot them being
taken prisoners.
Four days of almost absolute quiet
followed, with only occasional artillery
fire and now and then a sputtering in
fantry volley across the glade with Its
burden ot death when the scout posts
on either sido thought they saw the
enemy. The weather turned warm
again and the field of battle was an
almost Impassable swamp.
Attack Without Drum Fire.
On the eighth day reports reached
the German lines that the Russians in
tended to make a surprise attack that
night without any drum fire. The Ger
man artillery therefore shelled the
Russian woods at a terrific rate at
hourly Intervals through the night. All
the troops remained on duty without a

That night again it was feared there
might be a surprise attack and so
again the German artillery shelled the
Russian lines until morning. But there
was no attack until the following noon,
when, without any artillery prepara
tion, the Russian onslaught was re
peated. A German officer told' me the
tory of that attack. He said: that It
he had not seen it himself he would
never have believed it possible that
an attack would come out of the Rus
sian woods, where the lines were al
most 1,500 yards apart
Suddenly, without any warning, a
mud-colored wave began to pour forth
from the forest. It was a line of Rus
sians three ranks deep, containing
more than 1,000 men. They marched
step by step, and did not run. Be
hind this was a second wave like the
first, and then a third, the intervale
between them being about 150 yards.
The German wtillery tore holes In
the ranks, which merely closed up
again, marched on and made an at
tempt to lire. They marched, as
tnough on parade. "It was magnifi
cent, but criminal," said the German
officer.
Then came a fourth line like the
other three. The first line was less
than 1,000 yards from the German
trenches. It came so slowly that It
was possible for the Germans to
make plans with cruel precision to
meet it
Caught Between Walls of Fire.
When the fourth line emerged from
tho Russian wood the German artil
lery dropped a curtain of Are behind
it and then a similar wall of shells
ahead of those in front. They then
moved these two walls closer togeth
er with a hall of shrapnel between
them, while at the same time they cnt
loose with the machine guns.
The splendid formation of Russians,
trapped between the walls of fire, scat
tered heedlessly in every direction,
but in vain. Shells gouged deep holes
in the dissolving sanks. The air was
filled with clamor and frantic shrieks
were sometimes heard above the in
cessant roar and cracking or exploding
projectiles.
Deafened men sought to dig them
selves into the ground In the foolish
belief that they could find safety there
from this deluge of shells. Others
raced madly for the rear and some es
caped in this way as if by a miracle.
Still others ran toward the German
lines, only to be cut down by the Ger
man machine-gun fire.
In less than twenty minutes the ter
rible drama was over. The attack had
cost the Russians 4,000 lives, and yet
not a Russian soldier had come within
500 yards of the German lines. "It
was a terrible harvest of death," said
the officer who described the battle.
It was the last gasp of the Russian of
fensive at this point
