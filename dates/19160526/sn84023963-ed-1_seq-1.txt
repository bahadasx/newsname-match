Would you feel creepy if you were
Tom Rooney ana was to drive the
car built for and partially by the late
Bob Burman ? If you are the least
inclined to be superstitious, you'd
never enter the new Premier special
racing car in the Sixth Annual Inter
national Sweepstakes race on the In
dianapolis Speedway, May SO.
But Tom Rooney is not given to
spooky emotions that disturb mental
equilibrium and is glad of this, his
second chance of his racing career to
play the star role of driver. His first
opportunity he turned into victory
and a bag of gold to the amount of
ten thousand perfectly good made in
U. S. A. dollars. This was late last
fäll on the New York speedway when
Tom came in second, averaging bet
ter than 100 miles per hour.
