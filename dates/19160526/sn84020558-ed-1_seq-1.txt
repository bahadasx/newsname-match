The oattle of Verdun continues un
abated. On both sides of the Meuse
river, northeast and northwest of the
fortress, the Germans are keeping up
their unprecedented bombardments
mid vicious infantry attacks, whjle
the French are replying to the Her
man guns, shot for shot, and under a
withering fire holding the Oermans at
almost every point.
One more gain, however, has been
made by the Hermans. After recap
turing Fort Douaumont and taking
trenches south and southwest of the
fort, the Germans to the west have
occupied a section of French trenches
after a series of attacks, in all of
which they were repulsed with heavy
casualties, except the one whorethey
penetrated the French lines.
Around Douaumont heavy artil
lery duel Is In progress, and north
west of Verdun the Oermans have
increased their artillery fire against
toe French on hill not. probably pre
paratory to another infantry attack
for possession of this much-fought -for
vantage point.
A German attack against the Rus
sians west of Dalin island gave them
momentarily the possession of a Rus
sian advanced trench, a counter at
tack by the Russians dislodging the
Invaders.

SPURIOUS HEIR
CASE ENDS WITH
AN ACQUITTAL
Republican A. P. Leased Wirel
CHICAGO, May 15. Mrs. Dolly Ledger-Wood
Matters and her two co-defendants
charged with conspiracy to
foist a spurious heir on the probate
rourt of Cook countv were found not
guilty today.
The trial of Mrs. .Matters, Charles T.
Mellon and Harry Kdwards arose from
an effort to obtain control of the en
tire estate of the late husband of Mrs.
Matters. Frederick Matters, a banker,
and moving picture, theater owner,
through the alleged imposition of a
posthumous heir on the probate court.
There were two hearings in the pro
bate court. On the first occasion Dr.
L. C. Kmile Bernard and Miss Des
Hosiers, obstetrician and nurse, re
spectively, of the Misericordia hospital,
Ottawa, Ont.. Canada, where the al
leged posthumous heir was born, tes
tified that Mrs. Matters had given
birth to a child Irene. James Mat
ters, a brother of the decedent con
tested the claim and last December the
doctor and the nurse confessed to ,
Judge Horner, of the probate court
that they perjured themselves when I
they swore that Mrs. Matters ga
birth to a child in the Ottawa hospital. ,
They asserted the child in question
was born to Jessie Bryan, whose real
name is Margaret Hyan. She testified
! that she was told that her baby was
dead. She said she believed the father
of her baby had gone to the war.
Indictments followed the confessions
of perjury. Dr. Beroard and Miss Des
Hosiers were jointly indicted with the
defendants but proved to be the state's
chief witnesses and it is expected they
will be given immunity. The trial be
gan May 1 and the jury was completed

"What did you want of the germs V
he was asked.
"I wanted to give them to certain
people," he replied.
The trouble with the germs. Waits
fiaid, was that they were not virulent
enough. He began to take an interest
in bacteriology long before his mar

given germs to Miss Peck for a while
he became discouraged, he asserted,
because of bis lack of success. He
put the germs in her food, but he de

"Oh, yes," he answered, ' i read
somewhere of an arsenical fly paper,

some and put it in her room.
"Did you administer any bacteria

"Yes, soon after she arrived. 1 had

and General Rafael Fstrada. com
mander of the troops engaged in the
ram Patau :. gainst the Yaqui Indian
tentative plans of campaign were de
cided or and many of the details
settled.
Pursuant to the recommendation of
fjcncral Btrada, it was decided to gar
rison all of the towns of the state and
to nse large cavalry forces to patrol
all roads and trails and run down the
Indians. As there is not sufficient
cavalry in Sonora, it was decided to
bring enough from Sinalola to tiring
(he patrol force up to eighteen hundred
or two thousand. It is conservatively
estimated that there are no more than
860 Yaquis in the field. .
Additional confirmation was esti
mated today to the rumor that the
Yaqui- have established themselves in
j force in the Sonora river district, their
headquarters being Sierra Aconchi,
i ;.inet y miles south of Cananea. Two
bands of warriors, totaling about 150
were seen on the road to this new
stronghold, while several other hands
are reported to have been trailed in
that direction. General Estrada says
lie is fully informed of these move
ments and has moved his troops to
checkmate the Indians.
As a result of the northward move
ment of the Yaouis the towns in the
Sorora river district are filled with
refugees and it is reiiorted that num
erous refugees have reached Cananea
and will make their way out to the
border. While the larger towns of
his fertile valley have garrisons, there
are many small villages and outlying
mining camps and ranches which could

says that several raids of this char

LONDON, May 2,r. The house of
Commons has rarely seen a demon
stration of greater unity than was
displayed this afternoon, when the

! standard of the prime minister in an
j effort to achieve r. lasting settlement
i of the Irish question.
This was the more remarkable be

statement regarding the situation and
the government's prep Si for a so- j

Mr. Asquith's speecl took an un
expected turn, for instead of giving
details, he made an earnest plea for
the settlement of the Irish question
by agreement among the contending
parties in Ireland and announced that
David Lloyd George had undertaken
the delicate task of bringing the
hostile factions together.
The premier concluded with an ap
peal that for a time all deflate on the
question, both in the house of com

view of the adverse eftect sucn an
argument might have in the difficult
undertaking facing the government.

2j. The penalty of expulsion pro
vided in paragraph 271 of the disci
pline of the Methodist Episcopal
church for members wHo play cards,
dance, attend the theater, or engage
in other similar amusements will re
main in effect for another four years
at least, as a result of the action
taken today by the general confer
ence. An attempt lead by Chancellor
James It. Day, of Syracuse University,
to obtain the removal of the prohibi
tion, failed by a vote of 434 to 300.
The figures are almost identical
those of four years ago. when a
ilar proposal was defeated.
Paragraph -71 of the discipline,
which is the basic law of the church,
was enacted in 1S72 and has remained
illy without change.
It has been urged as a basis for
removal that this rule Is never en
forced and that the specific warning
winch is given in another part ot the
discipline should be sufficient to con
vince members that the church
strongly disapproves of these diver
sions. The opposite contention has
always prevailed in the conference, I
however, that by withdraw of the
penalty the church will indicate that
ii favors lifting the ban completely.
The balance .of voting power was
held today by the eighty or more
representatives of negro conferences,
who threw their support almost sol
idly against any change. The foreign
delegates were about equally divided.
A majority of the others, particu
larly from the eastern part of the
United States, voted for removal, al
though nearly every delegation was
split.
The conference shut off all debate
by deciding to proceed with the vot- I
ing as soon as Chancellor Day had '
read the report of the minority asking
for a change, and Frank Xeff, of
Tulsa, Okla., had read the -opposing
recommendation.
After a long discussion the confer
ence voted not to elect a successor to
Bishop-elect Oldham, who was cor
responding secretary of the board of
foreign missions, but to restrict the
number of seceetaries to two.
It was also decided to postpone fur
ther the balloting for editors of the
church publications, which had been
made an order of business for the day.
The conference voted tonight to
with i transfer the headquarters of the
dm- church temperance society from To-
