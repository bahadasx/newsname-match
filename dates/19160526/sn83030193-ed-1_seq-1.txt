BOY VANISHES
FROM OFFICES OF MORGAN CO.; A
POLICE TAKE OP
William McManus, Eighteen
Years Old, Was to Distribute
Pay to Employees
CLERKS GAVE ALARM.
Disappearance Known Only
When the Pay Envelope
Didn't Come Around.
An elghtecn-yrur-old oftlco boy In
the banklns house of J. P. Morgan
Co., Broad and Wall Street.", walked
out of the building with JI0.313.3C that
didn't bclbng to;)ilm'nt 10.4a o'clock
to-dny. Three hours later, Acting
Cnpt. Dcevy of the First Branch De
tective Bureau was asked by a repre
sentative of the Morgan firm to tr
and pick up the trail of the office boy,
William McManus, whose home Is
somewhere In Nostrnnd Avenue,
Brooklyn and Ucttctlvo Martin Sher
idan wns assigned to the Job.
Young McManus had been In the
employ of tho Morgan firm for sev
eral years. It was part of his duties
to distribute the weekly pay roll to
the employers of the export depart
ment on one of the upper floors of the
building. This he did every Friday.
Generally the envelopes containing
the wages of tho employees were
handed to McManus about noon by
Stanley KnowIr, one of the cashiers.
Mr. Knowles was cry busy to-day
and when McManus appeared In his
office at 10.45 o'clock and volunteered
to help out by placing the money In
the envelopes there was no suspicion
that ho had nny object but to show
himself an up-to-the-minute em
ployee. Mr. Knowles handed McManus
$10,515.3'.' and the envelopes and
.McManus departed, ostensibly to stuff
the bills and small change Into the
envelopes and then distribute the
good cheer to the export department
clerks.
It was not until 1 o'clock that the
export department reported that the
pay envelopes hadn't arrived. Some
of the clerks had reported that they
had boon unable to purchase their
lunches. Not until then was It dis
covered that young McManus was
missing.
n-otoetlve Sheridan on reaching the
bank found that another office boy.
a chum of McManus, Is also missing.
However, the superiors of this second
lad were lo ith to believe that he was
a party to thu $10,000 robbery and re
fused, at thin time, to make a com
plaint against him.

man of tho United States Steel Cor- ,
poratlon, declared to-day In his ad
dress to thu annual meeting of tho
American Iron and Steel Institute at
the Waldorf-Astoria. That wa nro
not prepared for war and should be
willing to "pay liberally" for peaco
was tho burden of Judge Gary's ad
dress. The Ideas on peace and prepared
ness set forth by Judge Gary ap.
peared to be more In harmony with
thoso of President Wilson than with
iiu'su vi ini, i.oosevcit, who was
Judge Gary's guest at a recent mem
orable dinner of millionaires. How
ever. Judge Gary made one point
clear, and that is that the steel In
dustry Is committed to th policy of
a protective tariff to guard against
the Invasion of foreign trado after
the great war,
Judgo Gary's advice to candidates
for ofllcc was embraced In tho fol
lowing extract from hlH speech:
"The full extent of the suffering and
misery caused by the war Is fully
realized only by thoso who are brought
Into close personal contact with It; but
wo know It Is a terrible thing, and wo
are sure it should not be allowed If It
can be prevented.
"Moreover. If It becomes necessary
to engaao In a contest with any of tho
principal European countries, we nro
unprcpired to fight, even in self de
fense, and it would tako much time
and money to prepare. The large ma
jority "of thn people of the United
States uro determined wo shall not
become. Involved In serious trouble
with any European country and they
do not look with favor upon any sug
gestion that proposes It, except aa a
lust resort. It itimi perfectly clar
and cartain that any candidate for
office who antertaina a contrary opin
ion is doomad to defeat."
Reverting to. tho subject of peace
In another part of his address, Judge
Gary said:
"We are In favor of peace for our
nation; not at any price, but we
would, It necessary, pay liberally for
it. We would fight any other nation,
b. only defensively. However, we
do not wish for war, and wo believe
It Is not necessary to engage In It
with any European nation or nations.
"So anxious are our people to Avoid
trouble and to maintain a peace foot
ing they are willing to submit, tem
porarily, and until the minds of hot
heads have had time to become cool
and culleoted, to many acts seemingly
unfriendly and even to sneers and
Insults, beforo they will assume an
offensive altitude and run tho risk of
1 precipitating a war unnecessarily.
! "Thin Is a strong statement, but It
represents the real nttltudo of a large.
I majority of our people. They sin
, cerely believe we shall get through
and como out of the apparent shad
ows of doubt and distrust, the clouds

The evidence which led to the is
suing of the warrants was obtained
by Commissioner Wallsteln withJhc
co-operation of the Health Depart

that a certain clique of abattoir own
ers who made a practice of slaugh

protection. One of them. It Is charged,

At about the tlme"Commlssloner

The confidences of Dr. Walte to Dr.
.Morris J. Karpas of the Long Island
Hospital, who went on tho stand in
the prisoner's defense, were related to
the Jury through tho nftcrnuon, reaJ

Dr. Karpas ie:nl extensivo notes
on Dr. Walto's wholo life, as told him
by the dontlst.
Somu of tho Incidents n this ver
sion of tho accused's consistent life
of sin were slightly different from
those embodied In tho early record
of tho trial.
"I never loved Clara Peck," Dr.
Walte. said, according to the alienist.
"I married her for social position. I
meant to kill her rlghtj away. She
was kind and considerate, but she
was not soulful; she was not musical
or romantic. She did not satisfy mft
along those lines. I meant to use her
money; I expected to study and ac
complish great things."
At another time, according to Dr.
Karpas, Dr. Walto aald: "I did not
commit tho crimes these killings
to achieve results, but because I
knew I could do anything I chose
without being caught." Again Dr.
Walto dilated to the alienist on hi
lack of emotion while at murder.
"After killing him." ho said, "I could
stretch out my hand and fingers
without a tromor."
Dr. Karpas read and lectured i
1 iri lor more tnan a
hour. Hn said Dr. Walte was an
egomaniac.
"Dr. Walte, did you ever try to
kill your wife?" waa the first ques
tion asked by Attorney Deuel, when
