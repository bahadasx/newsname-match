HOW ONE COUNTY AGRI
CULTURAL AGENT IS
ENCOURAGING ANOTHER
Dean Russel of the College of Agri
culture of Wisconsin is authority for
the statement that, next to the Babcock
est, the greatest help to dairying in
VVisconsin has been the Dairy Associa
tion. Any one who is acquainted with
ibe wonderful work of the Livingston
County Holstein Association will admit
at once that this statement also applies
to Michfgan.
Realizing the necessity of such or
ganizations for the highest success in
dairying, the County Agricultural
Agent for Saginaw County helped his
farmers organize what is known as the
Saginaw Valley Holstein Friesian As
sociation. Although this organization
is less than a year old it already has a
large membership and is exercising a
powerful influence in the development
of dairying in that County.
In August, County Agent Robinson
arranged for an excursion of the Sagi
naw Association to Livingston County
v to visit that famous organization. More
than a hundred farmers went from
Saginaw County by automobile and by
"train. Tho men from these two As
sociations sat down to dinner together
and after dinner the Livingston County
farmers took their automobiles and six
parties were formed, visiting about
twenty hevds each. It was a big day
for the visitingorganization. It taught
them the great purposes of organiza
tion such as the stimulus received from
others in the same business; the need
of a highclass, standard product; and
the value of associated effort in adver
tising that product and in being able to
Supply the best markets in car lots with
.. product as fine as human skill has
yet produced.

MEMORIAL DAY
A Proclamation by the Governor
At this hour the great European nations arc engaged in deadly
conflict. History fails to record any other war of like magnitude
and ferocity. JIuman imagination utterly fails to appreciate the
agony of the millions of mothers and children whose wishes were
never consulted. Millions of human lives have been ruthlessly
sacrificed, to say nothing of the widespread destruction of
property. Chaos has been substituted for order; hate and reyenge
dominate the minds of the contesting rulers of these great nation s,
Death is their watchword.
In the United States peace reigns. This great nation is fear
lessly conserving the faith and loyalty of its people. Our watch
words are "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." At this
hour we look back to our last awful sacrifice upon the altar of
liberty. On May thirtieth the remnant of the Grand Army of the
Republic, together with one hundred million, freemen, will pay
tribute to the living and the dead. Let us reverently and lovingly
join the spirit of the immortal Lincoln in dedicating our lives to
the task of increasing our "devotion to that cause for which they
gave the last full measure of their devotion; that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this
nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth."
May the democracy of our beloved nation in this hour of
world peril fearlessly and successfully point the way to universal
peace. The regenerating need of Europe and of the whole civilized
world is democracy and more democracy.
While decorating the graves of the "Boys in Blue", let us
lovingly remember our Spanish War Veterans; likewise the
patriotic self-sacrifice of American mothers who gave us our
heroes. .
Therefore, I, Woodbridge N. Ferris, Governor of the State of
Michigan, do hereby issue this, my Proclamation, and heartily
urge the observance of Tuesday, May 30, 1916, as Memorial Day.
As a part of the public exercises of Memorial Day, I suggest
that bells be tolled from 12:00 o'clock noon until 12:05; that flags
be placed at half mast, and that comrades' stand with uncovered
heads during this period. I
Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State, this
eighteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine
hundred and sixteen, and of the Commonwealth the eightieth.
WOODBRIDGE N. FERRIS. Governor.

DE RUE BROS. MINSTRELS
THE BEST MINSTREL SHOW
EVER SEEN IN UNION
CITY
A Clean, Up-To-Date Show
Run By Good Men.
From The Evening Times, Union
City, Ind., Thursday Apr. Gth.
Following the policy that he estab
lished many years ago, never to play
an attraction unless he had reasonable
assurance that it was first-class, Man
ager S. J. Fisher last-night presented
the De Rue Bros. Minstrel Show, and
his judgment again proved correct, for
it was the best minstrel show that has
ever played the Union Grand Theatre.
Beginning with the band concert on
the street, under the personal direc
tion of Bobby De Rue, cornet soloist,
and artist musician, which stamped the
band as one able to travel on its own
merits as a concert band, to the last act
of the show at the theatre at night,
there wasn't a thing in the entire bill
that was cheap or second-class.
The "Operative Orchestra" under
the direction of Paul Ryner, violin ar
tist and director and including W. II.
Daneaue, Gabe Elhart, Robert Dev
ereaux, E. W. Murphy, Paul Rezousky,
Will Yago, George Espy, Wallace Nog
gle, with the "Beau Ideals of Melody"
Cleon Coffin, Charles Leahy, Jerome
Leahy, Walter Webber, Leon Flaherty,
Van Gilson, opened the program with
a vocal and instrumental overture that
was a peach and made everybody feel
good early in the game.
The bright and sparkling first part
was put on by Mack Monroe, Carl Rit
ter, Bert Allen, William Sears, Wm.
Turner, Richard Turner, and conver.
sationalist Leo Diefendorf, in a way
that left absolutely nothing to be de
sired and made even the oldest the
atre goers forget all about "the old
time minstrels." Everything intro
duced, "including "In the Gardens of
the Gods," "My tango Man," Oh That
Beautiful Band," "Auntie Skinner's
Chicken Dinner," "I Want to be There'
"I Want to Go to Tokio," "Face to
Face With the Girl of My Dreams,"
"Alabama Jubilee,"'" "Railroad Jim,"
"The Little Grey Mother," "I'm Not
So Foolish," "Dixie," "The Bell in the
Light House," "Over the Billowy Sea,"
and closing with eccentric dancing by
Allen and Turner, met with the unani
mious approval of the audience.
The second part introduced Billy and
Bobby, the Only De Rues, and what
they did to the risabilities of the audi
ence was a plenty.
The particularly fine thing about the
whole business was that it was clean,
wholesome fun and not once did they
resort to cheap vulgarity, yet it was
spontaneous and hit the spot like the
crack of a whip.
The second part opened with "Circus
Day in Dixie," which brought on Billy
and Bobby. Among the further hits
introduced were: Twentieth Century
Rag, When Sunday Comes to Town,
Gloomy Gus and His Jitney Bus, Sleep
Baby Sleep, In My Old Kentucky Home
Arabia, closing with "Fare Thee Well
My Own Mary Ann," by Wm. Sears &
Company, in which such a real "scrap"
was staged that one well-known youDg
married woman became alarmed and
wanted her husband to stop it before
they came to blows.
The big bill included a third part
opened with a hit by the orchestra and
introducing the Great Hennier, Happy
Beft Allen, Scare Crow Eccentric Dan
cer, Alabama Pickaninnies Introduc
ing all styles of dancing, Billy De Rue,
The Talkative Man, De Rue and Sears
Musical Comedians, Golden City
Quartette, and coming to a perfectly
hilarious close with the Turner Bros,
in a comedy acrobatic act that rung out
last particle of laugh that was. left in
the audience. The show was magnifi
cently staged and costumed, without an
evidence of the least shoddiness.
Altogether we will say, great are De
Rues and their show. We are all
sorry that during the seventeen years
they have been traveling they never
came our way before, and now we hope
they will keep on coming.
