Karsch's,
MANDAMUS PROCEEDINGS
Asking Court for Order Permitting an
Inspection of Doe Run Lead
Company's Books
Robert Holmes through his attor
neys filed in the St. Francois County
Circuit Court this week an alternative
writ of mandamus against the Doe
Run Lead Company and P. H. Dear
ing, its secretary and treasurer, for
permission to examine the books,
records, papers and documents of that
company. In his mandamus proceed
ings he declares that the petition is
made in his own behalf and on behalf
of those stockholders similarly situ
ated. He sets forth that he (Robert
Holmes) is a stockholder of the Doe
Run Lead Company, and is the owner
of 12 shares of the capital stock of
said company, and is also the owner
and holder of 3,112 shares of the cap
ital stock of the St. Joseph Lead
ComDanv. which owns and controls
97 per cent of the stock of the Doe
Run Lead Company, also that he is a
stockholder in the Mississippi River
& Bonne Terre Railway Company, a
.subsidiary of the St. Joseph Lead
ComDanv. He declares that all three
of said companies are closely allied
one to an other and have common in
terests in St. Francois county, with
officers largely the same In each com
pany. The writ sets forth that on the 15th
day of May, 1916, your petitioner
made demand in writing, during bus
iness hours, at the office of the Doe
Run Lead Company, upon F. H. Hear
ing, secretary and treasurer and cus
todian of the books, records, papers
and documents thereinafter described;
that during business hours, at the
office of said company, and at reason
able times, he have access to the
right, privilege and opportunely, to
gether with his duly authorized
agents, including an expert account
ant and a stenographer, to inspect
and examine the books, records, pa
pers and documents of the Doe Run
Lead Company, together with the
right of his agents to make extracts
and memoranda from the same. That
in said written demand, petitioner
stated his purpose for making the ex
amination, and that although there
was a legal duty imposed upon the
said F. H. Dearing, in his capacity as
secretary and treasurer, to comply
with the request, he wrongfully and
arbitrarily, although he had the books,
records, papers and documents in his
possession, refused to permit the pe
titioner to have access to and to make
inspection of the same as demanded.
The petitioner further states, that
his purpose in making said demand
and his desire to inspect the books
and records, is by reason of an injury
he believes he has suffered connected
with his rights as a stockholder of
said company, and states on informa-
Perhaps Fatal Stab
What may result in a fatal stab
bing occurred Saturday afternoon,
about 5:30 o'clock, at Elvins, in which
Jess Forsythe was the aggressor,
stabbing a baker, late of St. Louis,
who had but recently gone to work in
the Elvins Bakery. Forsythe stabbed
the baker twice, once under the right
shoulder blade, and again in the left
side, which stab probably entered a
lung. His recovery is doubtful, though
he is getting along very well at this
writing.
Just what the trouble was about we
have been unable to learn, but some
kind 'if family trouble appears to be
mixed up in the affair. The baker and
his assailant were supposed to be good
friends up to the time of the stab
bing. The baker boarded but one or
two doors removed from the For
sythe home, and it seems that when
Forsythe returned home Saturday ev
ening he found the baker there, when
a quarrel is supposed to have result
ed. Both were thought to have been
drinking, in which case there is no
need of searching further for a "rea
son." Forsythe was brought to Farming
ton and lodged in jail, but on Monday
he was released on bond. Preliminary
hearing has not been set, pending the
result of the wounds.

tion and belief that from time to
time, from May 1, 1910, to the pres
ent time, a large number of cars of
coal were paid for by the Doe Run
Lead Company when in fact said cars
of coal were not received or used by
said company, and that during said
period, he is informed and believes,
that it was the practice of officers and
agents in charge of the purchase and
delivery of coal intended for the con
sumption of the Doe Run Lead Com
pany, to consign certain cars of coal
to said company, and also to consign
the same identical car or cars to
either the St. Joseph Lead Company
or the Mississippi River & Bonne
Terre Railway Company, or both of
them, and that by reason ot said
fraudulent action the Doe Run Lead
Company would not actually receive
I or use the coal so consigned to it and
k.o.Ld suffer loss when payment
' wmilH frauHnlpntl v hn rpnnirf'H of it
on false invoices rendered to it from
time to time, and as a result of said
practice petitioner has been caused
to lose, as a shareholder in said com
pany and as a shareholder in the St.
Joseph Lead Company, large sums of
money, and that the value of his
stock in said' companies has been
greatly depreciated.
The petitioner also avers that it is
his purpose to bring a bill in equity
against the corporation, its officers
and others, to stop the practice de
scribed, also an action, in his own
name and on behalf of other stock
holders, to recover from any and all
persons who have wrongfully nnd
fraudulently received money from
the Doe Run Lead Company in con
nection with the practice described,
and on all sums of money so recov
ered. Other matters are set forth,
and the petition closes by asking the
court, because of the refusal to com
ply with his demand as a stockhold
er, that it award against the Doe Run
Lead Company, its officers and direc
tors, and F. H. Dearing, its secretary
and treasurer, custodian of the books,
records, papers and documents, a writ
of mandamus requiring him to give
petitioner, at the office of said com
pany in Bonne Terre, Mo., and at such
time as the court may fix as reason
able, access to and the right, nnvi
lege and opportunity, together with
duly authorized agents, including an
expert accountant and a stenographer,
to inspect and examine the books, rec
ords, papers and documents of the
Doe Run Lead Company, together with
the right ot his agents to make ex
tracts and memoranda from the same,
and for such other process orders,
remedies and relief as to the couvt
may deem meet and proper.
Hanged Himself
Otto Forbes, of Flat River, hanged
himself Saturday evening in a shed at
the rear of his residence. Life was
extinct when the body was found. The
suicide was about 25 years old, worked
about the mines, and leaves a wife,
and child about a year old.
Forbes is said to have been drink
ing, and it is the supposition that de
spondency was .the cause of his rash
act, from which his wife and baby of
necessity are the real sufferers.
A Suggestion
We suggest to the managers of the
Farmington Free Public Library that
they make arrangements to keep the
Library rooms open on Sunday after
noons, for the benefit of the many
men and youths who every Sunday
are seen sitting or standing around
after the mails arrive reading the pa
pers. There are numbers who would
avail themselves of the comfortable
ooms Sunday afternoons, learn to
appreciate the advantages there of
fered, and interest themselves person
ally in the Library and make it more
popular. Think over the suggestion.

AN ANNUAL
The Services and Basket Dinner of the
Christian Church at Libertyville
Last Sunday
Last Sunday the Christian Church
at Libertyville gave its annual church
gathering and basket dinner in con
nection with the services of the day.
This church is, perhaps, the mother
of the Christian or Disciples denom
ination in Souteast Missouri, though
the old Antioch Christian Church in
Madison county is said to be a com
petitor for this honor. Both congre
gations, however, were organized
about the same time, and the honors
may be equally divided between them.
The first minister of the Christian
Church to preach a sermon at Liberty
ville was named McMurtry, but our
informant did not remember his first
name. This was back in the thirties
of the nineteenth century, and before
there was any church organization.
A church organization was formed by
Elder James Lunsford (the title "Rev
erend" being eschewed by ministers
of the Disciples or Restoration Move
ment) along in the late thirties or
early forties, the first deacons being
Samuel Kinkead and Zeno Blanks.
The congregation held services in a
log school house at first, and then Mr.
Kinkead made a deed to the church of
the ground on which the present house
of worship stands, and a frame struc
ture was erected thereon. After a
few years this building was burned,
and the congregation went back to
the old log school house to worship;
it in turn, was also destroyed by fire.
Moses Baker had a lot of brick on
hand which he had made and burned,
and a brick school house was erected
and made large enough to admit of
the congregation worshiping in it.
Fire seems to have followed the move
ments of the congregation, for the
brick school house was shortly a vic
tim of the flames, but in no way daunt
ed, the congregation went about
erecting a brick church on the site
deeded to it by Mr. Kinkead. This
was along in 1856, and the building
still stands, now about sixty years
old. It was built by John Samuels, a
devout and earnest member of the
faith.
Some of the earlier ministers who of
ficiated for the congregation and have
long since passed to their reward, were
James Lunsford, Alexander Proctor,
who afterwards west to Independence,
Mo., where he served as pastor of the
Christian church continuously for over
forty years, Jacob Creth, John Phoe
nix and Dr. John C. Farmer, father
of Mis. Mary Counts of Farmington.
Some of the more prominent families
of Cook Settlement who were asso
ciated with the movement, many of
whose descendants still live in that
vicinity, were the Kinkeads, the Ba
kers, the Sebastians, the Blankses, the
Harrises, the Shaws, the Grahams
and the Lawrences; and among some
of the older living descendants of these
early families, whose faces are set
toward the evening twilight of life,
who were present last Sunday, were
Mrs. Sophia Shaw, Mrs. Mary Baker
Phillips, Rollo Sebastian, N. A. Kin-
kead and J. C. Crow.
The annual gathering and basket
dinner has long been a notable fea-
ture of the Libertyville Church, and
last Sunday's gathering was a dc-
lightful counterpart of the many that
had preceded. Fully four hundred
people were on the ground, and but
for the heavy rain Saturdav night and
Civic League
The Woman's Civic League ofi
Farmington was temporarily organ
ized at the Public Free Library rooms
Wednesday afternoon, May 10th. The
organization grew out of a called
meeting of ward leaders in the clean
up day movement. All members vot
ed enthusiastically for the formation
ol a civic improvement league.

of her city is urged to become a mem

This section of the country was vis
ited by another refreshing and much
needed rain Saturday night.
OBSERVANCE
the threatening look of the clouds
the crowd would have been larger.
There were people there from Freder
icktown, Farmington, Flat River, El
vins, Bonne Terre and other points.
Of course they could not all get into
the little church building to join in
the service, but strolled about the
ground ami enjoyed the meeting with
and greeting of friends, for it didn't
rain and the weather was fine. Rev.
J. M. Bailey, pastor of the Farming
ton Christian Church, conducted the
services, and being in good fettle de
livered one of his best sermons. Rev.
J. 0. Snodgrass of Fredericktown
was to have delivered the afternoon
discourse, but for some reason did
not arrive, and Mr. Bailey was press
ed into service for a second sermon,
although a pair of anxious young lov
ers were awaiting in Farmington for
him to come and launch their life
boat out onto the matrimonial sea.
But we have skipped the noon hour.
Immediately after the morning ser
vice, crowds were seen carrying tempt
ing looking baskets towards a long
table that had been provided for the
occasion, where they were emptied
and a feast fit for the gods was spread.
If you have ever been to an old-fashioned
picnic and of course you have
you may have an idea of the bounti
ful refreshments that gladdened the
eyes and whetted the appetites of the
already hungry crowd. It was enough
to make the dispeptic and dietetic
forget his delicate stomach and to
suffer afterwards, comforting him
self with the grim satisfaction, "Well,
it was worth it."
The old-time hospitality and cor
diality of Libertyville we mean that
large area of rich agricultural coun
try surrounding the few houses that go
by that name are perennial growths
whose roots are deeply imbedded in
the soil of human love and kindness.
There was no stilted formality, and
it made the visitor's heart feel good
and at home as some bronze-faced
stalwart son of the soil extended a
cordial hand with the self-introductory
remark, "my name's so-and-so,"
as if he were really glad to see you
there and he was; or as some sweet
motherly-faced woman held out her
gentle hand while her eyes smiled a
welcome which you realized was as
genuine as the heart that beat be
neath the motherly bosom; and the
charming young women and girls
with faces as fresh and fair as the
first blush of dawn, and young men
and boys with glad faces looking out
upon life with the courage and hope of
undaunted youth. It was a moving
picture of rural life, beauty and
wholesomeness, pleasing the eye and
gladdening to the heart, causing one
to realize that Cod is good and boun-
tiful in his blessings to mankind a
gracious Father to be worshiped and
praised and served,
The writer is glad to have been with
that goodly company. May these
gatherings continue in their annual
rounds to bless and brighten the lives
of these gracious people, drawing
them closer and closer together in
their mutual, social and religious re-
lations, until in one universal chord
they sing with spirit and under
standing, "West be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love."
j "What Is It T
The manner in which the querry in
last week's Times, "What Is It?" was
received by many, and their hearty
acquiescense in such query, is indeed
most encouraging to The Times in its
effort to "throw the light on" dark
places. It is indeed a real pleasure
to struggle for the rights of the pco
i ...i i ip i . ... ,
' F'K w,,e" suc" euons meet wnn sucn
I n.earty response. Again we ask,
the Electric Line a r
railroad or a
street car line?" We would be glad
to hear from our readers on this ques
tion. Cannons Mounted
Picket Post G. A. R. secured four
instead of one of the old civil-war
cannons to be mounted on the Court
House grounds. Concrete foundations
upon which to mount them were put
in the past week and the guns placed
in position to De unveiled next Tues
day, National Memorial Day. One
stands at each corner of the Court
House yard, and remind one some
what of a fortification. The guns are
old 12-pound mountain Howitzers.
YOUNG LUTHERAN PEOPLE
GIVE ENTERTAINMENT
Wednesday evening the young peo
ple of the Lutheran Church gave a
fine entertainment that was greatly
appreciated and enjoyed by a large
audience. The program consisted of
ten numbers, embracing piano duets
vocal, piano and violin solos, a read
ing, two dialogues, a humorous chorus
and a good night chorus. The young
people acquitted themselves admirab
ly in each and every number to the
great delight of their friends. The
entertainment was given in the old
church buildirg. which mn'es a suit
able hall for just such purposes.

Sad Death of
Mrs. J. N. Burks
Mrs. Amanda C. Burks (nee Mar
shall), wife of former State Senator
Jasper N. Burks, died at her home in
Farmington, after a lingering illness
of nearly two years, on Wednesday,
May 24, 1916, in the 63rd year of her
age. Mrs. Burks had recently been
to Chicago on two occasions to be
treated, returning home several weeks
ago with no encouragement of re
covery. She was born at Coldwater,
Mich., and was married to Jasper N.
Burks, in Ste. Genevieve county, Mo.,
in February, 1868, and the following
named children and her bereaved hus
band survive her: Flora, wife of Har
ry E. Horn, Salt Lake, Utah; Arunah
J. Burks, Denver, Colo.; Ed and Miss
Hattie Burks of Farmington; Vest
Burks, Rogers, Mich.; Cleve, wife of
C. W. Whitney, and Bird, wife of El
mer Ferguson, Chicago, the latter of
whom were with her when she pass
ed through the portal of death into
life. She also leaves one sister and
two brothers Mrs. Luther Yarington,
Andrew and Amos Marshall of Fre
donia, Kansas and five grandchil
dren. Mrs. Burks was a woman of quiet,
domestic nature, lovingly attached to
her family, and whose place in their
lives and hearts can never be filled,
but whose memory will remain with
them as a sweet incense. She was a
devoted Christian woman, faithful in
all the walks of life, and a consistent
member of the Baptist CniCn ono
of the charter members 0f the Farm
ington Baptist congregation. She
and Mrs. Lizzie Lloyd Turley of St.
Louis were the only two surviving
charter members of the church here.
The sympathy of all our people goes
out to the bereaved husband and chil
dren in this greatest sorrow that has
cast its shadow over their lives.
The funeral will take place this
(rriday) afternoon, services to be
conducted at the Baptist Church, and
interment will take place at the K.
of P. Cemetery.
Ready Response
The article in last week's Times, on
"Farmington Can Get Free Mail De
livery," has met with such a ready
response on the part of several citi
zens as to give this paper much en
couragement to continue its fight for
a Bigger and Better Farmington.
There is much alertness
business element of Farmington to
take hold of anything that promises
in tUn i t I ..i.-fij. ,.
v "tvreuiiniL UIIU upuullUing OI
this city, and to The Times manage
ment it is a genuine pleasure to work
m connection with such a live bunch
of citizens.
As "prosperity is gauged by the
pay roll," it is therefore important
that no opportunity should be over
looked to add to the city's pay roll
even when one additional salary is
concerned. In this matter of obtain
ing free mail delivery for Farmiiir-
ton, it means at least two possiblv
hree salaries added. It also means
'dried convenience to every resident
vithin the confines of Farmington
nd it can be secured at no cash ou
'ay only a little co-oneration. Do
vou ask: "Is it worth while?
Annual Recital
The pupils of the Schubert School
f Music will give a recital in the
'Ugh School Auditorium, on June 8th
ind 9th. Look out for the additional
nnouncement of this evert in The
Times next week.
Too Much Oil
Generally speaking, Farmington
streets are now in splendid condition,
being properly graded, fairly smooth,
and with a liberal coating of oil on
the surface, which will result in pre
serving them in their present condi
tion, as well as checkmating the dust
nuisance.
On a few streets, however, the oil
has been spread a little too thickly.
Especially is this true on West Col
umbia street, where the second
sprinkle . trifle too heavy to
secure the best results. It is too
heavy to permit of absorption within
a reasonable time, and has made the
street surface more or less "muddy."
An excess of oil on the streets is
really worse than an insufficient
amount, as it must either be worn in
or carried away by passing vehicles
when once it is turned loose, and such
process takes time. And in the
meantime it is impossible to compute
the inconvenience and destruction
caused from this excess oil on floors,
rugs and carpets, as it is impossible
to keep from tracking it, even from
many of the crossings. It would have
been far better to have waited until
mid-summer to have applied the sec
ond sprinkling. However, when the
oil is beaten in, or dissipated, even
Columbia street will be most invit
ing. Masonic Cemetery
Editor Farmington Times:
Will you kindly give this letter
space since it is to bear testimony of
a long needed improvement which is
now in process of being made.
Anyone who has had loved ones
buried in the Masonic Cemetery, in
the past years, has had many df-j of
sorrow ano pam at tho nesjbjL'ted
condition of many of the graves and
of the whole cemetery. In fact, if
strangers had seen it, they would be
justified in saying very uncompli
mentary things of our town'3 civili
zation. Now the work going on gladdens
the heart, for the terrible overgrowth
of Yuca and of many vines is being
cut down, the trees trimmed up, the
grass mowed, the heavy weeds pulled
out, and when all has been hauled
away, the citizens of Farmington, one
and all, may feel proud of the ceme
tery If m addition each lot holder
would see to it that every grave is in
uiuer, mat sucn vines as cover the
stones and make an underbrush were
removed, the cemetery would look
still better.
If those who plant flowers in their
lots would study the right kind, an
other beauty would result. For in
stance, everyone knows that the Dor
othy Perkins and Bridal roses are
beautiful but they need trellises to
climb upon. When they climb over
stores, obliterating the name and dis
coloring the stone, and also maHr.g a
tangle on the ground, they are not
things of beauty but things of ugli
ness and discomfort. This is true of
certain lillies, so use thought when
planting flowers, and keep the great
law of love in mind, that n i
pur small part in this world's life
harmony with the life of others.
The old name for a cemetery was
Gods Acre." Let each lot holder
join hands with the company and help
to claim and put this God's Acre in
order and keep it in beauty.
Memorial Day will be next Tues
day. Let us endeavor to care for our
lots in the cemetery at once.
