city, and the sons are Alonzo Kinder
of Bloomfield; Linus Kinder of College
street, and Therman Kinder of Illmc.

. SIX NEW SMALLPOX CASES.
Disease Also Appears in Fruillatid
and Other Places in County.
A half dozen new cases of smallpox
have developed in Fornfelt in the last
two days, according to advices received
from there yesterday, raising the total
in Fornfelt to 15 cases. The disease
likewise is prevalent in several com
munities in the western part of Cape
County this week.
Dr. Arthur Pee yesterday came in
from Fruitland, his home, and told
his friends that smailpox has been
discovered in that vicinity as well as
in other communities.
In Fornfelt the physicians fighting
the disease are confident thit with the
1'ot weather on their side, the malady
will not spread and they will be able
to stamp it out within a short time.
Nin.e.box cars, all occupied by negro
workmen, at Jllmo have been quaran
tined, isolating about 50 or CO men.
It is said that in "e.nch of the cars at
least three or four negroes are suffer
ing from the disease.
In Fornfelt but two of the cases are
considered serious. Owin,r: to the fact
that smallpox does not thrive in hot
weather, there is no great alarm over
the condition.

Fuxieo merchant, last night was said
to be resting well following an opera
tion yesterday for appsr.dicitis at St.

Glenn Thompson of Oak
Ridge, Gets Deep Cut at
Base of Brain.
BOY'S FATHER TAKES
CASE TO J. P. COURT
Information Charges Ora Kinni-
son With Assault to be
Tried Soon.
When Prosecuting Attorney J. Hen
ry Can.thers yesterday tiled an infor
mation in the court of Justice of the
Peruc J. H. Bowers at Oak Ridge,
details became known in the Car-e of
a light o-.er a girl, tiie sweetheart of
nc of the combatants.
The affair took place last Saturday
and resulted in one cf the men being
wounded scriouslv on the back of the
neck near the base of the brain and
on the face. He was cut with a sharp
instrument, the exact character of
which officials have not been able to
learn.
The in'ormation was sworn out
against Ora Kinnison, charging him
with assaulting Glenn Thompson, .son
of Herbert Thompson, a prominent
Oak Ridge farmer. Young Thompson
has been put temporarily out of com
mission as a consequence of the fight.
Doth young men are about 10 years
old and have known each other since
childhood. Also, Loth have known the
girl in question for a long time and
they mutually became su;tors for her
hand.
Kinnison claimed a victory over his
boyhood friend and rival. The young
lady received a letter last week and
informed Kinnison of it, whereupon
Kinnison's ire was aroused and he
accused Thompson of writing it and
announced that he intended to settle
the dispute by way of fists.
The two joined in combat and pelted
each other for several minutes. In the
i.iix-up, it Is asserted, Kinnison drew
forth a weapon with which he cut and
struck Thompson.
Thompson was rendered unconscious
from the force of the blows he sus
tained and the loss of blood. The
wound on the back of his head is sev
eral inches in length and those on both
cf his cheeks likewise are long and
deep.
Thompson also suffered bruises
about his body. It was not learned
last night if Kinnison had been ar
rested following the fight. A warrant
has been issued for him. The infor
mation made out by Prosecuting At-
tornev Caruthers was obtained lv the
father of young Thompson, who came
to the Cane after the fight.
On Kinnison's arrest the trial will
be held in Oak Ridge before Justice
Bowers and it is expected that it will
attract much attention in that com
munity. FILES FOR CORONER.
Dr. Arthur Poe of Fruitland Will
Make Race for Coroner's Job.
Dr. Arthur Poe of Fruitland, one of
the best known Republican leaders in
the west end of Cape County, yester
day afternoon was in the city to file
lor his candidacy for Coroner in the
August primary. He paid his filing
fee to George H. Meyer, treasurer of
the Republican County Central Com
mittee, and will file his declaration
with the County Clerk shortly.
Dr. Poe has been a delegate to many
Republican conventions, and is favor
ably known through the County.
J. H. C. Kerstner, who is known as
one of the best accountants who ever
has been in charge of the County
Treasurer's book:; at Jackson, filed for
re-election Monday. Mr. Kerstr.er
probably will not be opposed in the
Republican primary and his election
in the fall is practically assured.
Congress Only To Have Perfunctory
Meetings During Convention Weeks
Washington, May 24. A formal
agreement was reached today by Sen
ate leaders for a practical cessation
of legislative activity during the
national conventions. Three-day cd
journments are to be taken from June
3 to June 20, with only perfunctory
business transacted on meeting day?.
The House probably will follow this
procedure.

General French of the British army, was recently decorated at Saloniki by General Serrail (man with folded arms at
right) with the French military cross. The decoration took place in the presence of British, French and Greek officers

E. G. GRAMLING'S CAR
COLLIDES WITH NAG
Stray Horse Stores up Motor and
Blinks Lights With
His Heels.
A stray horse on the Jackson road
last night created a near panic among
the six occupants of the -.r.otor car of
Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Granting when the
horse and car collided, head-on, about
a half mile outside the city limits.
The horse got to its feet after hav
ing been neatly tossed to the center
of the road by the blow from the car,
spike the Gramling engine by planting
rough-shod hoofs in the center of the
radiator and, by way of a parting
shot, stove in both the lights with a
pair of well-placed kicks from his
nimble hoofs. The animal then gal
loped down the road and disappeared
in the darkness.
The car was being driven toward
the Cape by Mr. Gramling and as he
approached the place where the col
lision occurred, he glanced to the side
of the road to observe two young men
backing an automobile out into the
road from a driveway leading to a
farmhouse.
As he looked in that direction the
stray horse got in the way of his car
and tiie collision resulted. The Gram
ling machine was going about five
miles an hour, but the force of the
compact knocked the animal down.
Those who were in the machine wth
Mr. and Mrs. Gramling were: Mrs.
Rrlph Wammack of Bloomfield, who
is visiting in the Cape; T. R. Challen
or of Cairo, a representative of the
Cotton Belt railroad, and Mr. and Mrs.
Gramling's two grandchildren.
The women and children were
brought into the city in another ma
chine, and the Gramling car was haul
ed in by Dr. C. E. Schuchert and taken
to a garage.
None of the occupants cf the car
were injured in the collision, although
badly frightened. It was not learned
who the owner of the horse is.

SCENES 300 YEARS
OLD IN PAGEANT
1200 School Children Will Move
Park Back Three Centuries
of Time.
Fairgrounds park this afternoon
will be pushed back SOO years to be
come a setting for a ppgeant and
masque staged by 1200 school chil
dren, all costumed in the brilliance of
the days of Queen Elizabeth and the
English play writer, William Shakes
peare, in whose honor the second
annval pageant is being held.
Shakespeare himself will be repre
sented in the center of the pageant,
and the dancing, imis-c and scenes to
be staged by the public school pupils
will be woven into a dream that the
author is supposed to hnva had.
Scores of the pupils will be garbed
to represent divers colored flowers, all
of which are frequently rrentioned by
Shakespeare in his ploys and poems.
Others will r-epresent characters taken
from his books. They will spring into
reality and act and talk as they did
"00 years ago when Shakespeare
wrote the story.
The pageant is being held in cele
bration of the Shakespearean tercen
tcrary, or the three hundredths anni
versary of his death. Nearly all the
Care school children will have some
part to enact in the pageant and the
wore on the affair has been going on
for the last few weeks in order to
make it a big success.
Each of the pupils has furnished his
own costume, patterned after a stand
ard make for the division of the pag
eant he or she belongs to, and the cos
tumes have been made for the most
part at a cost of about .5 cents each.
Miss Helen Mueller, one of the teach
ers, has made 40 costumes for the
little folks in her class. In other
classes the teachers have aided the
pupils in getting their outfits made
correctly, and when the rehearsal was
held the other day, everything was
found to be in tip-top shape for the
public performance.
The pageant will commence at ?
o'clock. The children will go from the
Broadway school to the Fairgrounds
park headed by Dr. C. E. Schuchert's
band.
It is estimated that several thou
sand people will go to the park to wit
ness the spectacle. The program has
been lhided into two parts and will
contain dances and historical sketches
of many descriptions.

FINCH IS CHOSEN
G. 0. P. DOORKEEPER
Fornfelt Lawyer Will be Sergeant-at-Arms
at Chicago Republi
can Meet.
James A. Finch, the well-known
attorney of Fornfelt, has been named
cne of the assistant sergeant-at-arms
of the Republican National Conven
tion, which convenes in Chicago June
7, or two weeks from yesterday. This
appointment will place him in charge
of one of the entrances to the Coli
seum, where the convention will be
held.
Mr. Finch is a former Circuit Judge
and served one term as Secretary of
the Republican State Committee. He
is one of the best known Republicans
in this section of Missouri and has
been prominent in State politics for
a number of years.
As door-keeper he will have for dis
tribution a large number of tickets of
admission to the Coliseum, and it is
understood that the Republicans of
Southeast Missouri are organizing to
march on him in a body. He hrs
endeavored to keep his appointment a
secret in order to prevent r. stampede
from pass-scpkcrs, but it became gen
erally known in Fornfelt yesterday,
and a report from that city last night
stated that he remained in his office
yesterday afternoon with the door
locked and barred to ward off an in
vasion. The demand for passes to the two
ralionr.l conventions has been abnor
mal this year. Harry E. Alexander,
who lant week received a bundle of
ticket i to the Democratic convention,
has been compelled to spend most of
his time in his automobile in order to
elude his pursuers. He stated yester
day that he had given nway his l.t
ticket.
Finch and Alexander have been
made the custodians of all the passes
allotted to Southeast Missouri by those
in chr.rge cf tho two national conven
tions. They will be able to take care
of the Southeast Misccurians who fail
to get tickets to the big meetings. As
a sergeant-at-arms and door-keeper,
Mr. Finch will be in a position to pass
in his friends, provided, of course,
they are able to locate his door.
As there are more than a dozen
entrances to the Chicago Coliseum,
Mr. Finch expects to escape from
many Southeast Missourians.

A. M.Stearman, Who Fought
With Lee, WiJI Start for
Higginsville Today.
GIRL CANVASSED TO
GET HIM THE FUNDS
Young Woman Gets Him Trans
portation and then Cares
for Veteran's Baggage.
A. M. Stearman, who went thr-.mgh
ihe Civil War fighting under Lee for
the Lost Cause, will say good-bye to
Cape Girardeau today when he starts
for Higginsville, Mo., to enter the
Confederate Home. He said yester
day that he would never again see
C;'pe Girardeau, which has been his
hoire for many years.
Mr. Stearnan is 78 years old and is
growing feeble. The last session of
the Missouri Legislature appropriated
money to penr.ion each Confederate
veteran. They were to be given $10
each per month, but the amount set
aside was -iot sufficient to meet the
demand and Mr. Stearir.an's last check
came in October. Since that time he
has been staying with distant rela
tives in the city.
He was too proud to Leg and he
didn't want to be a burden upon his
relatives. He knew Harry E. Alex
ander and he -ailed upon the attorney
to ask him to line! him a home. Mr.
Alexander v.rete to George 1. Cross,
superintendent of the Confederate
Veteran's Home at Higginsville, tell
ing of the old warrior's circumstanres
and requested Mr. Cross to admit him
to the heme.
Monday morning a letter came from
the Higginsville institution, saying
that arrangements had been made to
take care of Mr. Stearmnn. The
pioneer was the happiest r.ian in Cape
Girarrleau when he received the glad
tidings, but when he learned that the
Confederate Hoire eoul ! not furnish
the necessary transportation, he was
again depressed.
Miss Frieda McClatchey, Mr. Alex
ander's stenographer, heard of the
war veteran's plight and volunteered
to assist him. She drew the cover
from her typewriter, picked up a slip
of paper and left the office.
She called upon her friends and told
them that old man Stearman needen!
money to take him to Higginsville.
where h would enter the Confederal
Heme. Each person who heard her
story gave something, and when sh"
had finished he" car.va?s, she had th
railroad fare of $7.14 and about
extra. This she gave to Mr. Stear
man. They went to the station to
gether, bought a ticket, checked his
baggage and this afternoon he will
begin his trip to Higginsville.

mended the confirmation of Louis D.
Brandeis as Supreme Court Justice.
