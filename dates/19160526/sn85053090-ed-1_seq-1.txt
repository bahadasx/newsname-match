The Melting Pot.
"'/he Melting Pot", a six reel
photo play featuring Walker
Whiteside of theatrical fame, was
shown at The Piay House Sunday
evening and established the fact
that the management of this pop
ular picture theatre can and
does secure some of the best re
leases in film productions. While
the audience was of fair size and
the window receipts showed an
appreciated profit the excellence
of the play shou'd have been en
I joyed by many more, and the
! house entitled to a much larger
! crowd. The play Sunday eve
ning was in keeping of the Play
House motto, to show "the best
there is" and we are assured that
future features on their program
will be as good as the last and up
to standard. Considering the
added expense in showing these
pictures in Ekalaka, such as the
furnishing of their own electric
lights, the employment of their
special five piece orchestra and
the overland transportation of
their films, to be greeted by a
full house on special feature occas
sions would be only contributing
a deserved liberal profit to the
owners. To be able to secure
such features as "The Melting
Pot" in Ekalaka, especially so
far from the railroad and to get
regular film releases from such
firms as the Mutual Film Corpor
ation should be appreciated by
the people of this section and if
you have not as yet attended one
of their Sunday night features go
next time and we assure you that
you will not be dissappointed,
but will become an enthusiastic
booster, as many have, for the
local amusement theatre.
To the Public—After the 15th
of June I will open up a Minute
Lunce and close the American
Plan.—L. T. Ramme.

Joshua Jones Dead
Joshur R. Jones was born near
Kalamazoo, Michigan on May 7,
1854 andipassed away at his home
near Elgin, on May 18th. 1916 at
the age of sixty-two years, and
11 days. Death was due to heart
failure,
With his parents he removed
from Michigan to Missouri when
of the age of sixteen years. At
that time he joined with the old
time cow outfits and journeyed
westward, spending some time
in the Black Hills country of
South Dakota and later taking up
his residence in Montana where
he has resided for the past thirty
years. He was united in marri
age Dec. 21, 1906 with Mellisa
Kimball to which union, two
children, Thelma and Clarence,
were born, who with the sorrow
ing widow and a host of relatives
and friends survive. Joshua
Jones was a member of the
church at Elgin and a worthy
helper in the upbuilding of the
community. Like all of the old
timers, who settled in this sec
tion in the.early days of the de
velopement of this great state,
Mr. Jones had endured many of
the hardships of early life and
gained a wide reputation for hon
esty and his home was always a
welcome place for the pioneers
and those who settled here later.
The funeral services were held
from the church in Ekalaka on
Saturday at 2 o'clock p. m. after
which he was laid to rest in the
local cemetery. The services
were very largely attended by
friends and neighbors of the üox
Elder valley, Rev. W. S. Bowden
officiating. To the bereaved
widow, children and other rela
tives, the sympathy of the entire
comunity is extended.

Action Is What Counts
The motto of today is action.
To one in the vortex of a thrill
filled motion picrure career this
fact comes with compelling force.
Mediocre plots and aimless stories
have given way to virile stories
carrying heart-stirring "punch
es." These latter require some
what of mental mechanics on the
part of the scenario writer, great
skill on the part of the producer
and limitless energy and daring
on the part of the actor.
There is a certain witchery
about doing daring things, that
become part of one's being and
urge one onward on new endeav
ors, new stunts and risks in the
exciting race for thrills. How
ever thrills must not be put into
pictures merely because they are
thrills Rather there should be a
definite, and logical reason, the
actual dare-devil stutns being
woven together with a tense dra
matic story.
In "The Girl and the Game"
fapearing at the Play House every
Wednesday) there is the most
gripping seccession of thrills I
have ever seen in motion pict
ures, and that is saying much,
for many daring things have
been accomplished.
This new screen novel in chap
ters is, to my mind, "the thrill
continuous." And, too, the dra
matic situations are threaded
with an unusual tenseness, re
vealed in the story's unfolding in
a manner both orderly and logi
cal, and it is because there is a
reason for them, that t,hey mean
so much and stir one's heart
to the full.
For instance, in the first chap
ter of "The Girl and the Game,"
I am compelled to jump my horse
"Rucket" iuto a river from a
bridge that has just been opened,
I do not know that any other
leading woman has ever attempt
ed such a feat.
It is something in which the
element of personal risk is very
great, but this is one of the de
rnands upon a leading woman
that must be met, and met with
out losing sympathy or that air
of femininty of which we are all
so ^ rou ^
But by that I do not moan the
frail side of women. I mean the
heroic side-deeds of valor based
upon the highest ideals. Mr.
Frank Hamilton Spearman, auth
or of The Girl and the Game,"
ceitainly is the possessor of a
wondrously inventive imagination
proved not only by this story, but
by his pievious writing.
In the past I have found it in
convenient to have an author's
imagination tempered by the fear
of possible injury tome. And in
making this statement I do not
believe I am any braver or more

l Otr,
courageous than some other wo
men on the screen, only I realize
keenly how insistent the public
is for thrills and especially thrills
in'which a women is the pivotal
figure.
It is because of this realization
that in framing the scenario from
Mr. Spearman's story that I have
made the thrills cascade through
out the chapters with a disregard
to personal risk that is predicted
neither on bravado or a great
courage, but to meet the public
demand that the heroine "live"
the part and be all that the
scenario makes her. —H.Holmes.
Miles City Roundup
Miles City is preparing to en
tertain the largest crowd ever
assembled to witness a Frontier
Celebration on July 3, 4, 5, when
more than 500 cow boys of the
Montana range will strive to hold
their title as the Champion Riders
of the World.
Secretary Otis has recently
issued a statement in which the
celebrated "Powder River" cow
hands challenge the World to
produce more daring and skillful
riders, asserting also that the
management will offer a hand
some prize to the party that can
produce a horse, steer or buffalo
that cannot be ridden.
The Miles City Round-up is re
nowned for its magnitude and
conceded to be the most gigantic
affair of its kind on earth, and
this year's show will smash all
records.

acre, and greet the famous Indian
warrior on the same ground on
which Custer camped twenty-four
j hours before the battle.
