wheat growing counties of South

Grain For The Skim-Milk
Calf.
Calves are usually fed whole
milk for two to three weeks, then
gradually changed to skim-milk..
About the time of changing, be
gin to feed a little grain but do
not think it is neoessary to use
oil meal or any other hlgh-prioed
feed, high in protein, or fat, or
both. Experience at the Mis
souri Agricultural , Experiment
Station shows that a mixture of
two parts of corn and one part of
oats, by weight, givos as good
results as oil-meal and ready
mixed oalf meals often purchased
at much higher prices. Bran is
not especially good for the young
oalf because it is too laxatjve.
The grain mixture should be ted
immediately after the milk, and
neither should be fed too liber
ally or scours may result. L.

Cut Worm Poison.
If outworms prove troublesome
in the garden or oornfieli, they
oan be held in cheok with a mix
ture ot 25 pounds of bran, half a
pound of Paris green or lead ar
senate, and a quart of molasses.
The lead arsenate ia now cheaper
than the Paris green, and which
ever is used should be diasolved
in two gallons of water to which
the molasses and ground pulp of
two lemons or oranges should be
added.
This poison mixture should be
soattered in the evening in order
that it may stay moist aa long as
possible, as the worms refuse to
eat it after it has become dry.
The addition of the orange or
lemon juioe is important in raak
ing it attractive to the worms
but it is likely to be attractive to
the ohiokens and some other farm
animala also with fatal results.
