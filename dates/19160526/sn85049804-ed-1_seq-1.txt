TWO LETTERS.
There aro two letters written espe
cially to the Bystander for the col
ored voters to read and think about
and tell nil your friends about. One
is by Attv, S. Joe Brown and the
other is by I. M. Jones. It means a
great deal to us secret society men.
OUR GRAND CHAPTER.
This was the first time that Ye
Ediotr visited the Iowa Grand Chap
ter. There are many things very
disgusting to the intelligent, espe
cially the way that some of the grand
officers run around spending valuable
time electioneering for re-election. It
lowers the respect for the officer and
the office, but one could see that there
were a few true women who have
really seen the star and have the
correct idea. The time may come
ere soon when the educated women
will not be satisfied with juch action.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Elsewhere will be found in this pa
per some reasons and facts as to the
reason why women should vote.
Those who are opposed to woman
suffrage advance some of the most
unreasonable arguments. One mem
ber of my race had the nerve to tell
me that if woman suffrage should be
granted that only white women
would be allowed to vote and colored
women could not because there was
no provision for the colored women.
I told him that he was grossly mis
represented, for up in Iowa we have
no color lino on our statute books and
the law if passed granted the colored
women the same right as any other
women. We have always believed
that taxation without representation
is unjust. If the women are to help
pay the bills for running this gov
ernment they in all fairness should
be permitted to vote.
REPUBLICAN VOTERS WAKE UP
We think that it is high time for
our republican voters to arouse
themselves from the lethargy of in
dolence and go to the primaries in
every state of this union and vote for
the candidates for republican nomi
nation who will stand for equal man
hood, right for all of her citizen^
regardless of race, color or previous
condition. Be sure to find out where
he stands on those fundamental
questions. Such questions of segre
gation, discrimination, Jim Crowism,
etc. Ask him does he believe in closl
ing the door of hope, of opportunity,
of a fair chance in life upon a man
because of color. Tell him to let
merit, ability and efficiency secure its
just dues, regardless of the man. If
we will be careful who we nominate,
when they get into office and the
great test comes we will have true,
honest, broad-minded men to make
and execute our laws.

SAMPSON FOR ATTORNEY GEN

Sampson Criticises Social Conditions
Clinton, May 4-During the course
of his address in the Methodist
church here last night, Henry E.
Sampson, assistant attorney gener

dustrial conditions in the United
States were not as they should be,
else we would not find that over
three-fourths of our male wage
earners are earning less than $600
per year, or that of the eight ntfl

proved the vital connection between
grinding poverty on the one hand
and misery, suffering, sickness, dis
ease, crime, revolt, anarchy, and the
more dangerous form of social un
rest on the other hand. Mr. Samp
son said that if we were to build a
greater Iowa, we must give more
attention the general welfare of
all her people, which includes the
wage earning classes. The state
should give more thought to the
problem of keeping all our able bod
ied men at work in some suitable
and productive employment, and at
a wage on which he can live with
self-respect and educate his children
so that they will become good citi
zens of this commonwealth. Ger
many, he says, is doing much more
than we for its laboring classes, in
the way of state labor exchanges,
municipal savings banks, mortgage
banks for aiding them to secure
homes, strict regulations as to the
guarding of dangerous machinery,
workmen's compensation, old age
and sick benefits, manual training in
the schools and employment at all
times. In that foreign country they
are bent on preventing human waste
in every form and human assets are
conserved with the same universal
solicitude that we conerve the ma
chinery in our factories.—Cedar

W. L. HARDING AGAINST NEGRO
FRATERNITIES.
Editor of the Bystander:
Having been interrogated by a
number of the Negro voters of the
state with reference/to the record of
Lieutenant Governor W. L. Harding,
now candidate for nomination for
governoy on the Negro question, and
being #*elf. a member of} qfreral
Negro fraternities aa well as BMm-
BWglMj
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People, I feel
it my duty to request space in the
columns of your valuable paper in
which to make public the fact that it
was this seme W. L. Harding, who,
when a member of the lower house
of our state legislature in the spring
of 1909 introduced what is commonly
known as the "Harding bill," but of
ficially as house file No. 136 of the
33rd general assembly, which, had it
passed, would have put out of busi
ness every Negro secret society in
Iowa using the same name or a sim
ilar name or emblem with any such
society of white people and would
have included all Negro Masons,
chapters of O. E. S., Odd Fellows,
Pythians end Elks, and that it was
only through the timely action of Mr.
R. H. Hyde, a prominent Elk Rev.
B. S. Ervin, a prominent Odd Fellow,
and Rev. A. Ford, Attoreny S. Joe
Brown, and other prominent mem
bers of the Masonic fraternity that
this pernicious bill was killed in the
committee room.
This is a fact that is noted by Hon.
W. H. Milligan, then grand master
of Iowa Negro Masons, in his annual
address to the Masonic grand lodge
at Keokuk in July, 1909, which ad
dress will be found on page 15 of the
proceedings of 1909 of the Most Wor
shipful United Grand Lodge of Iowa,
A. F. and A. M.
Hence, while I have no malice
against Lieutenant Governor Hard
ing, but I believe that a candidate
is justified in asking for the votes of
the people upon the record of his
past conduct, rather than upon
promises for the future.
For the above reasons I would rec
ommend Senator Joseph H. Allen as
the most available candidate for the
nomination fbr governor.
In order that the Negroes of the
state may determine on the basis of
record, past service and merit of the
candidate which they should choose
to support for governor, ask that you
give space to the foregoing plain
statement of facts, that the Negro
voters of Iowa may become better
acquainted with Mr. Harding's legis
lative record with reference to better
enable them to decide whether they
want to support him for the office
of chief executive of the state.
Remember the constitution of the
country in which we live guarantees
to its citizens "Life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness." Yours truly,.
BIDWELL FOR SHERIFF.
Mr. George E. Bidwell has an
nounced his name as a candidate for
sheriff of Polk county, subject to the
republican primaries. Mr. Bidwell's
platform is clean, honest and efficient
administration. By his long resi
dence and general acquaintance with
the people of Polk county, together
with the seven years as deputy U. S.
marshal and two years special agent
with the Iowa department of justice,
all of which eminently fits him for
the office He is a true friend of hu
manity and will treat all classes fair
and will 'show equal justice to all.
His many friends are asking your
support for him in the June pri
maries.
KULP FOR RAILROAD COMMIS
IONER.
Hon. D. E. Kulp of Emmetsburg,
Iowa, proprietor of the Suburban
dale Farm of that city, is one of the
active candidates for the republican
nomination for railroad commission
er. Mr. Kulp by age and experi
ence in public affairs is well quali
fied to fill the office of railroad com
missioner. He is a member of the
Iowa legislature and as a member
he has introduced several bills which
afterwards became a law, which was
very beneficial to the people of
Iowa. Among them was the law
governing the leases of elevators,
lumber yards, wire houses, etc., sit
uated on the right of way. Also a
bill known as the reciprocal demur
rage bill and many other good bills.
He also voted against the bill which
attempted to place Jim Crow laws
upon the statute books of Iowa, in
which every colored man of Iowa
was interested. He has always
stood for equal rights for the colored
people in everything that he has
been interested in, and any class of
people can feel safe if such a man
should be elected. He therefore so
licits your support at the polls pri
mary day.

HALLADAY FOR REPRESENTA*
TIVE.
Mr. A. .Halladay, whose put
and announcement we have run be
fore, is making a fine canvass for-'
representative for Polk county. Ha
is At present chairman of the re
publican county central committee,
and has been an active worker fos
the party for many years. By vir
tue of service he is entitled to theiz*
support as one of the two represen
tatives to be selected at the primar
ies. He is a good friend of the col
ored people and solicits their sup-
Now for fifty years the united
womanhood of Iowa has been work-,
ing as well as praying for the bal
lot for all the women of Iowa, and
in the hands of the voters of Iowa is
placed the responsibility of giving
the answer to this earnest appeal on
June 5.
Abraham Lincoln, the great lead
er, said, "I go for all sharing the
privileges of the government who
assist in bearing its burdens—by no
means excluding women."
Twelve states now enjoy equal
suffrage and in no state, not even in
Wyoming, where it has been tried
for forty seven years, has equal Suf
frage been pronounced a failure. No
homes have been ruined, no children
have been neglected and no harmful
laws have been championed by the
women. The women have not sought
office, rather have they given their
efforts to electing the best man for
the office.
ATTENTION NflGRO VOTERS.
There is a movement among some
of the Negroes of this city to organ
ize a permanent political organiza
tion for the purpose of unifying the
political strength of the race. I am
quite ~sure you will agree that we
stand in dire need of such an organ
ization. It is not intended to inter
fere with the local activities of any
precinct or ward clubs. All local
clubs may continue to act as they
are now acting in so far as their lo
cal affairs are concerned. The object
of the central organization is to uni
fy our forces under the direction of a
spokesman and an executive board,
whose duty it will be to keep the lo
cal clubs and individual voters in
formed as to who are the candidates
we as- a race should support, and
after careful investigation so inform
the representatives of the local clubs
just who to vote for and who to vote
against- We plan to have precinct,
ward and township representatives
who will meet with the central or
ganization from time to time and
confer together. We propose If pos
sible, to make the organization,
self-sustaining, and we are looking
to' loyal race men to help make it so.
I appeal to your race pride and man
hood to help us to help onrswves
Negroes. So come out Monday night,
May 29th, to the Masonic tempK
Eleventh apd Center streets, at which
time we will aleet officers and perfect
pennaato't awpaulsatiooi.

Candidate for Treasurer.
SUFFRAGE ELECTION NOTES.
A great opportunity confronts the
voters of Iowa on June 5. On that
day all the women of Iowa are look
ing to all the men of Iowa to vot«
"yes" on the suffrage amendment so
that their wives, mothers and siatera
may have a voice in the making of
those laws that govern the homa
and the environment of the growing
children.
When. Moses was distracted with
doubt and fear God asked him,
"What is that in thy hand?" So
the mothers of the land cry out, "Is
there son^e weapon near at hand for
me which I can seize to safeguard
all children, my own included? Is
there a weapon for the hand of
every mother? What but the ballot
can do these things which I would
do for the safeguarding of my home
318 family."
At the dose of a great suffrage
meeting one\pf the leaders in prayer
said, "I •pray^ftfi'^cb*,'Wilel:1 *1' sSifZZZ
praying Woman and I ask this gift
from Thee. I read, 'Why criest
thou unto me? Speak to the chil
dren of Israel that they go for
ward.' And does not that mean
that we must move ahead ourselves
and thus get the ballott that we
must work for what we need instead
of lazily praying to have blessings
dropped into our effortless hands?.
We must work out our own salva
tion. We mothers must work and
vote as well as pray."
