In the early days of the war he
gained an enviable reputation in the
eyes of the men of all parties for his
capable handling of the nation's
'finances and then came to the rescue
in the military emergency as head of
the ministry of munitions to provide
the army with shells.
Lately it was undoubtedly his. force
ful personality which converted the
country. in the face of the strongest
opposition to universal military serv
ice. Now,, he steps into the breach
to solve one of the most difficult po

British statesmen—to reconcile the
apparently irreconcilable sections of
Irish people and establish home rule
In Ireland. How Mr. Lloyd George
will be able to arrange a formal con
ference, and exactly what shape the
conference will take is still unknown.
He has been engaged for some days
in Informal talks preparatory to such
a conference and it is expected that

framing the finance clauses of the

DUPLICATION TO
BE ELIMINATED
Two New Members of Fac
ulty Employed for Agri
cultural College.
(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N- D„ May 26.—Further
plans for consolidation of similar
work in educational institutions of
the state were considered at the meet
ing of the board of regents held here
today.
While no definite action has been
taken as yet, it is thought likely that
the English and public speaking de
partments of the North Dakota agri
cultural college will be combined
under the jurisdiction of the English
department.
Two Appointments Made.
Two new appointments to the
faculty of the agricultural college
were also made by the board today.
Miss Katherine Jensen was named
head of the department of domestic
science, and Richard Craft superin
tendent of buildings and grounds. Miss
Jensen is a North Dakota girl, and
has been recently employed In the
domestic science department of the
Montana state agricultural college.
Hult in Charge.
At the session held Thursday at
Valley City the consolidation scheme
was formally launched by the com
bination of all of the departments of
foreign languages at the state univer
sity under the general direction of
Prof. Gottfried Hult, professor of
Greek.
Steps were also taken towards
eliminating to a great extent the dup
lication of work existing at present
between the university and the agri
cultural college.
With this end in view the work
along engineering lines was divided
between the. two institutions accord
ing to their respective needs. The
agricultural college will continue to
give training. along the lines of en
gineering science of direct value from
an industrial and agricultural view
point, such as highway, drainage and
gas tractor engineering, but the pro
fessional branches leading to the pro
fessional engineering degree will be
confined to the university..
Similar action was fekap,in regard
to tihe-training of teeehers.. Tsfceners
in agriculture and domestic solence
will' be -trained at the agricultural
college hereafter, but all others must
take their work at the university.
The department of pharmacy will
be retained at the agricultural college.
The heads of practically all of the
state educational institutions have
been .present at the meeting to pre
sent their needs to the board.
SALVARSAN REACHES
HERE FROM GERMANY
New York, May 26.—A shipment of
salvarsan valued at 9600,000 was re
ceived here yesterday from Germany,
it was announced by the drug com
pany which it was consigned. The
shipment was the first to enter this
country since the war began and the
supply in the United States was vir
tually exhausted several months ago.
Negotiations for the exportation of
the drug from Germany were con
ducted through the state department
and Emperor William Is reported to
have Issued a special order directing
the shipment.
The drug was sent through Hol
land and was shipped on a Dutch
steamer after the British and French
governments had given assurances
that it would not be confiscated.
Washington, May 26.—Under the
plan for World-peace as outlined in
the program of the League to Enforce
Peace, the United States might have
to relinquish some of its older inteir
pretatlons of the Monroe Doctrine in
the event of a dispute with a Euro
pean power, George Grafton Wilson,
professor of International law at Har
vard, declared In an address here to
day before the first national as
semblage Of -the league. Under peace
treaties algned In recent years. Prof.
Wilson said, .such concessions will
have to be -, made.
"The United States has, within re
cent years," hf mid, "become a party
to a large number of treaties in
which 'the-high contracting parties
agree that all disputes between them,
or evsry nature whatsoever, to the
settlement of which previous arbitra
tion treatlee or agreements do not ap
ply In their terma or are not applied
in fact, sbalV when diplomatic meth
ods of adjustment have failed, be re

an InterenatlQaal eommlsslen,' and
'they agree not to declare^ war or be

tion and before the report is submit

"Plainly therefore the Ttelted States
is bound already under the other

number, to submit dispute* Involving

would .'meet the requirements of the
