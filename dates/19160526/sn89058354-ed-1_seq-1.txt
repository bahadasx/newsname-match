PARIS IS SOON TO HAVE MODERN HOSPITAL CENTRALLY LOCATED;
PLANS FOR PROPOSED CITY PARK ARE BEING DISCUSSED BY MANY
PHYSICIANS PLAN
EARLY OPENING OF
LOCAL HOSPITAL
ON WOOD STREET
( ; t " " " "
Contracts Closed for Lease Of
Upchurch Building. Nurse
of Experience Will Be In
Charge of Local Institution.
No Contagious Cases Will
Be Admitted.
Early this week local physi
cians closed a contract for the
lease of the Upchurch building
on West Wood street for use as a
hospital: the building is now be
ing renovated and remodeled
and it is planned to have the
hospital open by July 1, at the
latest.
For more than a year a move
ment has been on foot among
.Pans physicians to open a hospit
al but it was not until this week
that the campaign took on defi-
n ite form. However, when the
"Jlo'J 'physicians determined to have a
, about for a suitable location and
soon decided upon the Upchurch
building, which was recently
purchased by H. L. Bruce.
Contracts for the lease of the
building were immediately closed
with Mr. Bruce and remodeling
work has already commenced.
The work will be pushed and
every effort will be made to have
the hospital open by June 15,
although it is probable that it
will be two weeks later before
everything is in readiness for the
opening.
The physicians announce that
an experienced nurse will be in
charge of the hospital. Several
applications for this position are
now being considered and the one
employed must be of known
ability and experience.
All surgical, confinement and
like cases will be admitted at the
hospital, but no patients suffer
ing with contagious diseases will
be accepted under any cir
cumstances. A white-tiled operating room
will be arranged at the building
and everything will be kept in an
absolutely clean and sanitary
condition.
A hospital, such as the one
soon to be opened, has long been
needed in Paris and the physi
cians are being commended upon
every hand for their efforts to
secure such an institution. The
public is manifesting much inter
est in the movement and the
plans are being approved by all
public spirited citizens of city
and county.
Within a short while announce
ment as to the nurse who will be
in charge of the institution will
be made.
The building on West Wood
street is centrally located and
convenient to both the N. C. &
St. L. and the L. & N. rail
roads. JUDGE TAfLOR LEAVES
Judge Lytton Taylor left this
week for Beaumont, Texas,
where he will locate. Judge

A-GO COMPANY IS
ON CO-OPERATIVE
BASIS; BIG CAPITAL
The A-Go Manufacturing Com
pany is a corporation chartered

organized in 1912, with a capital
ization of $10,000, all of which
was owned by only five people.
After having successfully operat
ed the plant for a time, and hav
ing satisfied themselves of the
quality of the products manufac
tured by the company, and seeing
the great possibilities, with the
co-operation of a sufficient num

they have indeed been "A-Go"
with those who have handled
them.

Years Ago Found
In City's Sewer
While cleaning out the sewer
back of Porter street last week,
J. A. Glendenning and E. T.
Moody found a gold watch, upon
which was engraved "George to
Emma. December 25, 1888."

watch was presented to Mrs.
Emma Trevathan in 1888, by her
husband, George H. Trevathan,
who died a few weeks ago, and
tha' it was lost soon after that
date.
When found the watch was in
good condition, and looked no
worse because of the years it had
been in the sewer.

BOOSTERS IN CAPITAE

GREAT CROWD PACKS AND
JAMS CIRCUIT COURT R00JW
BoostersCarry White Umbrellas
and Bring Band With Them
To Paris
Tuesday the Louisville Boost
ers came to Paris in their own
special train, were greeted at the
N. C. and St. L. station by about
1,000 people of Henry county,
marched to the court house and
made several addresses, after S.
P. Fitzhugh, temporary chair
man, had extended a hearty wel
come. The Boosters brought a band
with them and carried large
white umbrellas on which was
printed in blue letters "Louisville
Boosters."
Practically every business
house of importance in Louisville
was represented on the Booster
special, and the only regret of
the Paris people was that more
of the distinguished visitors
could not be heard, on account
of the short time they were able
to spend in this city.
At the court house, Mr. Fitz
hugh called the meeting to order,
delivered the address of welcome
and introduced Thomas Floyd
Smith, president of the Louis
ville Board of Trade, who spoke
briefly and then introduced Thos.
J. Knight, a well known Louis
ville attorney, who made a short
talk. Mr. Knight was often in
terrupted by applause, and when
he concluded he introduced
Arthur E. Meuller. of the Louis
ville Real Estate Board.
By his wit and humor Mr.
Meuller drew shouts of laughter
and round after round of ap
plause from the crowd.
When Mr. Meuller had finished
his address, it was about 11:25
o'clock, and in order to get away
on schedule time, 11:30, it was
necessary that the Boosters re
turn to their train.
The Boosters expressed them
selves as very much pleased with
Paris and the great reception
given them here. Many of them
are well known to local business
men and they enjoyed the short
time spent in this city immense
ly. Among those who took an
active part in arranging the
reception for the Boosters were
Mayor A. B. Scates, Councilmen
R. L. Dunlap, J. M. Freeman
and F. M. VanCleave, J. L. Hol
land, R. L. Howard, S. P. Fitz
hugh and others.
The Boosters will receive a
hearty welcome whenever they
choose to return to Paris.

Runaways Cause
Much Alarm But
No Damage Done

morning a team belonging to
Luther Bevil ran away on North
Market street, starting from in

no damage.
Several times the team ran
into the court yard fence, but
was not checked in their mad
run. A large number of horses
and mules were hitched around
the court yard at the time and it
is considered miraculous that a
general stampede did not result.

of Murray, came after the pris

indicted at the .same time that
the bill was found against Hodge,
have been previously arrested
and are m custody.
Hodge had been in Henry
county for sometime when he
was placed under arrest Monday.
SOCCESS OF PARK
MOVEMENT RESTS
WITH CITIZENS OF
PARIS; MUCH TALK
Location Near Atkins-Porter
School, Which is Ideal Spot,
Favored by Some.MineraI
Wells Is Also Suggested.
Everybody Agrees That Park
Is Needed; Plans Discussed.
With the people of Paris rests
the question of whether or not
the city shall have a park, with
seats and electric lights!
Since The Parisian called at
tention to the need of a park
some weeks ago, the citizens
have become interested in the
movement and for several days
there has been much discussion
of the proposed park and its
location. Numerous places and
plans have been discussed, but
as yet nothing has been done.
And in the meantime, summer
is passing away slowly, but
passing, and if anything is to
be done it should be done at once
in order that the people of Paris
may have an opportunity to en
joy the advantages afforded by a
park during the hot summer
months.
Some believe that the city
should purchase a desirable site
for a park at once, while others
believe that it would be best for
some public spirited citizens to
form a stock company, purchase
a site, fix it up for park purposes
and lease to the city. Those who
favor the tetter plan say that
within a few years the city
could acquire the property by
purchase. Another plan is to
purchase and fix up a park by
public subscription.
As a rule the public would be
pleased with either of the three
plans, being more interested in
having the park open as early as
possible.
One of the locations being dis
cussed for the proposed park is
near the Atkins-Porter school
building. Part of this property
is in woodland and there are
three fine springs on it. The
location is ideal. In fact, this
spot was made a park by nature
and merely needs fixing up to
make it one of the most beauti
ful places in West Tennessee.
This property could probably be
purchased at a reasonable figure.
Another location suggested is
at the Paris Mineral Wells, South
of Paris, near the plant of the
A-Go Manufacturing Co. It is
pointed out that the fine mineral
water available would be an ad
ditional reason for locating the
park here. Should it be decided
to locate the park at the Mineral
Wells, it is probable that a
"jitney" automobile line would
be put in operation between tha
down town section and the park.
Regardless of where the park
may be located, there is muck
sentiment in favor of establish
ing one somewhere about Paris
and doing it at once.
THOMAS LOWE DEAD
Thomas, the 7 year old son of
Bud Lowe, of near Mansfield,

nesday. Funeral services, fol
