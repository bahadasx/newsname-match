tj t med by the Swedish, steamer Anger

Spanish Crew Saved.

ts of the crew of the Spanish steam
r Aurrera, which was sunk by a sub
marine, have arrived at this port in
o of the ship's small boats.
Italians Not Pessimistic.
Home, via Paris, May 26. The re
treat of the Ita'ians on a portion of
the Trentino front has not caused any
pessimism in official circles here. It
is pointed out that the entire line of
battle is four hundred miles long and
that there need be no surprise that
there should be withdrawals at some
points under overwhelming pressure.
Tho fact that the Austrians now
hold a small mountainous section of
Italian territory is considered of small
importance when compared with the
fifteen miles greater territory occu
pied by the Italians in Austria. It
is also contended that if the enemy
continues to advance tnc conditions
which have favored him hitherto will
be reversed as the farther he gets
from his base of operations the more
difficult It will be to supply ammuni
tion for his heavy artillery. On the
other hand, the Italians will enjoy the
advantage of having good roads, four
main railways and Inexhaustible re
serves available at their immediate
rear.
Many Natural Obstacles.
These considerations are independ
ent of the natural obstacles which
ma ke8- th??Vusfcic- ta H tm-f ro n so-tl i f
ferent from that of Verdun. An offi
cial statement has been issued ex
plaining that It is impossible to limit
the war to trench fighting in a region
like the Trentino where large masses
of troops can be easily transferred
from one point to another without
weakening any section of the front.
A largo number of refugees from
Arslero, Asiago and neighboring vil
lages have arrived at Milan, where
they are being cared for In charitable
institutions. The evacuation of their
homo towns was ordered by the Ital
ian military authorities when the
great Austriau offensive started.

SOLEMN WARNING
i i-
Millions of War Sufferers in
Europe Makes Plain Need of
Red Cross Preparedness
in U. S.
I New York, May 26. Problems
which Europe faces today in caring
for the millions of war sufferers
make plain the need of Red Cross
preparedness In this country, declares
Ernest P. Bicknell, director general of
civilian relief of the American Red
Cross, ia a statement given out today
at Red Cross headquarters.
In the terrible tes,ts of efficiency
to which the societies of the Red
Cross havo been subjected by war
conditions in Europe and in the waste
ful futility of uncentralized and un
controlled relief agencies as observed
here at home," says Mr. Bicknell, "is
found a solemn warning to the Amer
ican Red Cross of the vital import
ance of preparedness."
The director general estimates that
JntheipspjUls,nithe.Jambulauccs and
tho relief stations in the" belligerent
countries no less than 500,000 Red
Cross v.'orkers are employed. In the
British Red Cross service alone there
are 80;000. More than 15,000,000 peo
ple, according to his estimate, have
been made dependent by the war op
erations while the areas fought over
contained a population of 35,000,000.

WILSON WILL
ADDRESSLEAGI
President Convinced that War
Is Not Deadlocked and Con
tinuance Only Means
Killing of More People.
Washington, May 26. President
Wilson is giving more serious consid
eration to the possibility of restor
ing peace to Europe than at any
time sjneo the outbreak of the war.
Erom an authoritative source it was
learned today that the president, is
preparing to do everything possible
in an informal way to bring about
the discussion of peace between bel
ligerent nations although ho has not
indicated Intention Immediately to of
fer his service formally as mediator.
His address tomorrow night before
the League to Enforce Peace Is ex
pected to outline his preliminary at
titude. The president is convinced the war
is deadlocked and that continuance
merely means the killing of more peo
ple and the further impoverishment of
European nations, both belligerent
and neutral.
Tho president takes the position, It
as authoritatively stated, that the
neutrals of the world as much as bel
ligerents, have a right to participate
in and if possible Initiate peace pro
ceedings because of the economic re
sults already developed and those
that will follow the conflict.
The president has been deeply In
terested In the growth of peace talk
among responsible people. He has
read and filed away recent speeches
by President Polncare of France; Sir
Edward Grey, foreign minister of
Great Britain and Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg of Germany. He
has conveyed the impression to those
who have talked with him that he
thinks the continuance of these discus
sions Is bound to have its effect In
restoring peace despite the belliger
ent attitude taken by some of the
officials.
The president has indicated that the
United States show Its 'friendship for
all tho nations involved by contend
ing for a peace which will be fair to
all of them and protect each from be
ing crushed or humiliated.

icy of the United States ' in Latin
American, which they denounced a3
imperialistic and hypocritical. Col.
Roosevelt Is charged with attempting

that President Wilson is unnble f

administration organs says:
"Tho Mexican nation can not .

spirators are aided by the machina

Questions American Veracity.
Mexico City, May 26. Foreign Min
ister Aguilar issued a statement say
ing that In spite of the agreement
made by General Scott with General
Obregon that no more American
troops would cross the border, four
hundred of the United States troops
had entered Mexican territory in pur
suit of bandits near Boquillas. The
statement says that these troops have
now been withdrawn from Mexican
soil.
Carranza Soldiers Jeer at Americans.
Columbus, N. M., May 26. Ameri
can truckmen recently have encount
ered a spirit of animosity on the part
of soldiers of some of the Carranza
command along the American line of
communication in Mexico, according
to stories brought here today. Near
Neuva Casas Grandes, 120 miles south
of the border, barbed wire barriers
have been thrown across the roads
several times recently, it was said
and last Wednesday a--train command'
ed by Captain R, B. Harper was halt
ed by a crowd in which there were a
number of Carranza soldiers. The
mob jeered at the Americans and
threw stones at them but no shots
were fired. Although several stones
struck members of the truck crew,
orders were given to proceed without
retaliation, according to the truck-j
men.
No official report had been made of
the incident at military headquarters
here today, however, and the belief
was expressed here that the action
was only that of a few unruly sol
diers. Border Towns Take Precautions.

of Dona Ana county. New Mexico,
along the border are taking extra pre
cautions today against trouble fol
lowing the shooting last night of a

order and was shot by Cassad, who
then surrendered to the sheriff at Las
Cruces.
Steps to Better Conditions.
El Paso, Tex., May 26. In its ef
fort to better the economic conditions
In Mexico the de facto government is
turning at last from arbitrary decrees
to direct subsidies, according to an of
ficial message received at the Mexi
can consulate here today from Mexico
City. A commission backed by twenty-five
million pesos, gold standard
has bpen organized by order of the
first chief to make loans to corn and
cotton raisers in the Laguna district,
which lies between Durango and Coa
huila. This section, formerly prosperous
has been ruined by five years of revo
lution and its people reduced to pen
ury. Farmers did not find it worth
while to attempt to produce crops,
which would be seized by the ilrst
marauding Dana to come ineir way.
Forced to Accept Government Paper.
Meantime the arbitrary economic
remedies put into practice by the gov
ernment remain In force throughout
tho republic. Merchants are compell
ed to accept government paper at Its
legal rate and their prices are also
set by decree.
General Benjamin Hill, military
commander of Mexico City, settled
the strike In his district yesterday
by forbidding employers to reduce the
number of their employes or to dls-
lillOO tUJ illllll KJk Hit lUf, .3W UV.l. .l.&Al
decree holds for three months. Se
vere penalties are threatened for vio
lation, unless the employer can prove
his case to the satisfaction of offi
cials. The government reserves the
right to take possession of and to
work an offending establishment.
San Antonio, Texas, May 26. Reb
els operating between Cuernavaca
