NORBECK BY TEN THOUSAND
Congressional Race is Undecided, Indications
Point to Patterson
With practically all the wires down
in the eastern part of the state due to
prevailing storm, it is almost impos
sible to get any definite information
on the outcome of the primary eleotion
there. Reports from scattered points
indioate positively that Nor beck is
nominated for governor by the repub
licans, probably by a plurality of
10,000
over Riohards and Egan.
The congressional situation in this
distriotis undeolded, with the indi
cations that Patterson has been the
ohoioe of the republicans. He ap
pears to have held his own, where he
was not expected to be the ohoioe and
has
come out of the Rosebud district
with probably 1,500 plurality to his
credit,

Aberdeen News: A large delegation
of local Odd FellowB were at the North
western depot Monday to weloome
home Grand Master elect A. L. Lar
son, on his return from the grand

The Hot Springs people provided
splendid entertainment for the visitors
and evinced a fine spirit of hospitality.
Next year's meeting will be at Yankton.
Mr. Larson said he was naturally
muoh pleased at the honor conferred

make of tire may be used
Akron, Ohio, May 26. (Speoial) Al
though Goodrich Silvertown Twin
Cable Cord Tires are already the ac
CBpted tire of the raolng driver, and

a generous recognition of the selection

no influenoe of money consideration
for so doing, has just been announced
by The B. F. Goodrich Company.

ation, the offloial association of oar
owners of this country, has prepared
rules to govern the determination of
the aotual champion for the season of
nineteen sixteen and will be the sole
arbitrator regarding such award.
The Silvertown Cord Tire la univer
sally recognized as the type of con
struction Insuring best results in speed
contests and is almost universally used
by racing drivers. There is no reason
why the Goodrich Company should ex
tend any award for the purpose of In
ducing the use of the Silvertown Twin
Card Tire, and it does not, but gives
outright without a string tied to it of
any kind whatsoever, ten thousand
dollars divided between the author

NEW ORDER RECEIVED
Larger Postal Savings Can Now be Made.
Order Received by Postmaster Eastman
Larger postal savings deposits will
now be aooepted at the postoffioe.
This is made possible by an important
amendment to the postal savings act
just approved by President Wilson. A
postal savings depositor may now have
an aooount amounting to $1,000 upon
whioh interest will be paid, Formerly
1500 was the maximum amount one
could have to their credit. This en
largement of postal savings facilities
will be very gratifying to the thous
ands of depositors who have already
reaohed the old 1500 limit and are anx­

ious to trast more of their savings
with Uncle Sam. Another feature of
the amendment that will avoid further
embarrassment to the publio and to
postal officiate, in doing away with the
limit on the amount that oould be ao
oepted from a depositor monthly.
Under the old law only $100 oould be
deposited in a oalendar month. The
amendment abolishes this restriction.
While the postal savings system has
already proved a signal suooess, as is
shown by the faot that more tbon half
a million depositors have over eighty
million dollars to their credit, still it
has fallen short of meeting the full
demands of the publlo because of the
restrictions whioh have now been
eliminated. Postmaster General Burle
son and Third Assistant Postmaster
General Dooliery have been tireless in
their efforts to seoure a modification
of the limitations and the new liberal
izing legislation is particularly grat
ifying to them.

gram will be one of the interesting fea
tures of the program and this together

furnish entertainment for the large
orowd that is sure to be here during
that time.
Committees have been appointed
and everything will be in readiness for
the visitors by the dates above men
