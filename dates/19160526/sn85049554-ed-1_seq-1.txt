Waukegan, 111., May 26.—A diversion
frpm the routine of Jury selection was
afforded today in the Orpet murder
trial by the summoning to court of l».
E. Jferwin, a dismissed venireman, to
answer an accusation made by attor

for the alleged murder of Marian Lam

Aierwln was dismissed yesterday, al
tho he repeatedly declared he never
had expressed an opinion as to the
guilt or innocence of the defendant.
Orpet's counsel, however, reported
to the court that investigation has
convinced him that Merwln had ex
pressed an opinion and that it was un
favorable to their client.
The court today granted a partial
motion for Hie stats to prevent
onstrations of affection toward her son
by Orpet's mother.
The state charged that Mrs. Orpet
dally 'entered the court room and in
view of prospective jurors went to the

President Taft Discusses
Objects of National
Organization.
TO MAKE WORLD
PEACE COMPULSORY
Platform Proposes to Compel All Na
tions to 8ubmit Questions to World
Court on International Disputes
Taft Takes Issue With Bryan—Taft
.to Introduoe President Wilson and
Sit N%xt to Him at Banquet.
Washington, May 26.—The object of
the League to Enforce Peace is not to
urge President Wilson to take steps to
stop the European war, ex-President
Taft, president of the league, said in an
address in opening a two-days' session
of the league here today.
"We are not here to urge the presi
dent to take steps to stop the present
war," he said. "Not that we are not
hopeful of such purpose, a purpose with
limitations, for an association like this
is much more likely to be realized with
a general platform for the benefit of
humanity."
The league hoped, Mr. Taft said, for
'a world agreement on a method to
make war less probable.
Would Make Peace Compulsory.
Mr. Taft explained that the league's
platform proposes compulsory submis
sion to a world court of all international
disputes not settled by diplomatic ne
gotiations and which are "Justiciable
questions."
Referring to the so-called Bryan
peace treaties with Great Britain and
France, Mr. TafV said it was argued
that the arbitration stipulation in them
was a delegation of the authority of the
president and senate over dur foreign
representatives.
"Since the Jay treaty of 1794," said
Mr. Taft, "some American nation had
been a party to eighty-four Interna
tional treaties, of which the United
States was Involved in two-thirds.
"In ten of these, which were boun
dary treaties. It was never suggested
that the government was delegating
any power at all to the tribunal. A
submission of a Judicial question Is not
a 'delegation of power to an agent—it
is a submission, of an Issue to a judge
andf ItJELjiamisoonjeR
submission ft delegation."
Takes Issue With 9iyaii.
\,V*|
1
Turning to the question of the'duty
of a nation belonging to the proposed
world court to use. its army and navy
in enforcing-its decrees upon other
members that should* go to war in de
fiance of the court's decrees, Mr. Taft
took issue with former Secretary of
State Bryan regarding the latter's con
tention that constitutional amendments
would be n'ecessary before the United
States could obligate Itself In this re
spect.
"I venture to think that his view Is
•wholly without foundation,"' Mr. Taft
said. "Referring to this nation's treaty
with Panama guaranteeing Panama in
dependence, the United. States Is under
obligation to defend Panama against
war. This duty can be discharged only
thru congress declaring war."
Edward A. Fillene, of Boston, de
clared European nations at the end of
the war would be favorable to the
League to Enforce Peace.
Other speakers today were R. G.
Rhett, president of the Chamber of
Commerce*of the United States Sam
uel GoVnpera, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, and Oliver
Wilson, president of the national
Grange.
Wilson Wants to .Speak.
President Wilson has confided to his
advisers, it was learned today, that he
hopes to make an address before the
league here tomorrow night which will
be of Importance in connection with
peace.
Mr. Wilson has practically completed
his speech.
The president will sit thru the ban
quet of the league at which he will
speak instead of following his usual
custom of arriving Just in time for the
speaking. He wants to learn as much
as. possible about the purposes of the
league.
Former President Taft will sit next
to Mr. Wilson and will lntroauce him.
