He related how he had fed (he

"What was your purpose In ad

"1 wanted them to die."
"Why?"

"I wauled their money," was

Throughout the story, nis

a resigned sort of smile almost
constantly.

When a child, he said, he was
cruel to animals, shirked his
home work, stole from every one
for whom he worked, stole exam
ination papers at school and rob

University of Michigan.
"My total thefts during fresh
man year at college amounted to

After graduation, while travel
ing for a dental supply house, he
said he stole $I,iioo Iryin hla em

Recounting his wooing of Miss
Peck, he hung his head as he
admitted the theft of a $10 hill
from the purse of the girl's moth
er.
"Were you ln love with Miss

"1 don't know," he replied.

Whether it is an Indica

themselves with the tiece—l

of conjecture.
Ever since ilie war started, mu

everything from rifles, heavy ar
tillery and ammunition, to trac
tor engine*, army automobiles,
ami airships.
The railroad yards have been
cluttered with the great bulk of
war freight. Ships could not bo
obtained lo handle the stuff as
spocdilv as il accumulated here.
These shipments suddonlv ceis

which cleared Wednesday for

There is not another crate ol

nitions, which formed a great
part of the cargoes a year ago,

Harbormaster L. 0. Parks de
clared today that he was making
an Invrstigtaioii of tlie unusual
condition. He confessed that the
cessation of war shipments had
puzzled him for two weeks, and
that he could find no reason for,
it.
"It would look, on the face ot
things, as if the European pow
ers were contemplating a speedy,
end to the war." said the harbor
master. "1 believe that this la
of momentous Importance."
At Other Port*, Too.
The cessation of war shipments
Is said to have occurred simul
taneously at Seattle and Port
land.
It Is not believed possible that
the allies could have placed them
selves in a position where they
could provide themselves with
munitions, as the demand for
American-made war materials
has increased steadily with tho
continuance of the war, rather
than decreased.
It Is also out of consideration
that these shipments should havo
been routed by any other manner,
as Puget Bound has been consid
ered the "hack door" for ship
ping to Europe.
