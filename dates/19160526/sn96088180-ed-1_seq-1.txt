IF
Washington, May 28. If Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt ' is nominated,
William Howard Taft will support
him, according to reports at repub
lican headquarters today. Tart, here
on work connected with International
peace, chuAled and shook his head
when questioned about tbe rumor.
"Why should I comment on such
a violent hypothesis?',' wss his only
reply. . '
It was reported here that a num
ber of progressives will not follow
Roosevelt in any paths he may select
ir he does not agree with the pro
gressives' course. Should the colonel
endorse a conservative candidate and
sidetrack important social Justice
planks featured in the 1912 bull
moose platform, the progressives In
tend to name one candidate and make
an Independent fight.
, Progressive republican senators
will try to place as many progressive
planks as possible in the regular re
publican platform, v '
LaFollette, Norrls, Cummins,

Fear Outcome of Conflict4
Parts, May 26. French troops re
pulsed violent German attacks on the
Meuse west bank and northwest ot
Verdun In last night's fighting, it was
officially announced today. Tbe
French also made gains on the east
bank. A smashing counter-attack by
the French also recaptured a trench
lost earlier in the battle near Thlau
mont farm, east of tbe Meuse. Near
this farm French soldiers advanced,
hurling hand grenades.
West of the Meuse Germans con
tinued to rake the whole French
front, especially around Dead Man's
hill and Avocourt, with a most vio
lent fire. However, in spite or this
preparation, the German infantry at
tacks were halted by a curtain of S
French projectiles.
A heavy bombardment of Hill 304
and or strong positions in front of
Avocourt was believed preliminary
to an attempt to storm the French
j holdings. This will brine German
troops close to the St. Menehoud rail
road, which leads eastward to Ver
dun.- .".:.,',.,;'. ;' ..',:'- V
Additional German gains on both
Meuse banks aroused tbe French to
a sense or the Verdun situation's seri
ousness. However, no anxiety Is felt
here. Even should Germans capture
the citadel, H would not alarm Paris.
At" the same time it is realized the
Germans ' are concentrating their
heaviest attacks against the fortress.
Uncounted numbers of dead and
wounded litter the elopes of Dead
Man's hill and the territory around
Douaumont. Shells are constantly
bursting among them, killing the
wounded and tearing bodies to bits,
So there will be no attempt to tabu
late the casualties until the artillery
clashes cease.

The fugitfvq sws frs hit in the

a strip of shirt and went on shoot
ing. Then two bullets struck his
abdomen, but tie continued his de
fense. Meanwhile tbe "mud flat3" were
black with spectators and a squad of
police was detailed to keep them out
or danger. A skiff, filled with armed
officers, approached tbe cabin cau
tiously by way ot Islais creek and
suddenly poured volleys into it rrom
a new angle.
For more than an hour the tight
continued, bullets from the. but sing
ing about the ears of the officers and
coming dangerously near the excited
spectators.
Taking advantage of every slight
unevenness la the flats, the police mm
crept steadily closer. . Finally the
shots from the shelter ceased. The
posse kept firing into it from all sides,
until the weather-beaten structure
waa riddled. . ' ;
Police then rushed the house. They
found the desperado dead on the floor
in a pool or blood, one bullet having
split his head open. He still clung
to his revolver.
Sergeant Morlarity was killed this
morning. For some time the Potrero
district had been flooded with coun

killed today was suspected and 'Mo
rlarity was detailed to question him.
Morlarity approached the suspect and
casually asked him where the bad

there came the crack ot a revolver

through the heart. He eft a widow
