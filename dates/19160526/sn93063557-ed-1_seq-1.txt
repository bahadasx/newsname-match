McFARLAND OELEGATE.
Prof. Raymond McFarla'nd of Middle
bury College was elected a dclegate at
large to the National Progressive con
vention by the gathering of Vermont
progressives in Burlington Wednesday,
The convention adopted a resolution iri
which they testified their allegiance to
the pnnciplea of the Progressive party,
their confidence in Theodore Rooseveit,
anu tneir wuiingness "toi co-operate
with any party which will honestly and
patriotically endeavor to make these
principles effective in the development
of American ldeals."
Prof. McFarland made an address at
the convention, in which he said that
the progressives did not hitch their cart
to a single man but to a group of prin
ciples and that the menibers of the
Party will stand by until they see these
principles carried out. Such occur-
rences as the loss of American citizens'
lives on the Lusitania Cannot be settled
by gold or by notes written on linen
paper. There is now a great need to
uphold American honor and the one man
who can thoroughly accomplish that
purpose is Theodore Rooseveit.
