There are homo enlivening prospects
ahead in county politics. Primary law
has changed the situation. Xow tho two
candidates iccciving the largest number of
votes will be elected, l'onueily it was
the custom for the political parties to
make two nominations, one from the
Kockingham and the other from tho
Marlhoio distiict. Under the present law
it is a clear field for all aspiiants, and it
is possible to elect both senators from
one probate district or two from one
town, for that matter. Frank A. DeWitt
of Xewfane, John II. Ware of Townshend
and Hermon E. Eddy of Urattleboro have
already declared themselves as candidates.
DeWitt 'andd Eddy have served as repre
scntativos and arc has seen service m
both branches of the lcgislatiue. The
Democratic aspirants have mado no dec

Plaintiff Sought Damages for Being
Shot by Station. Agent Jury Awards
Howo Child $708.78.
The Central Vermont railroad, de
fendant in tho suit brought by H. A.
Staten of Vernon to recover 'damages
of $10,000 for injuries received whon
t.ie plaintiff was shot and severlv
wounded twice by Hugh Collins, a sub-
stitiuo station agent at Vernon, did
not put in any evidence when tho
plaintiff rested in county court at Now-
tnno yesterdny afternoon.
Lpon motion of tho defendant tho
court ordered the iurv to return a
verdict for the defendant on the ground
that when Collins left the station to
get tho gun with which he shot Mr.
Staten ho was without the scope of
his employment by the company. Tho
court hold that his act in shooting Mr.
Staten was in no way a part of his
business as a railroad employe and
that tho company was not liable under
the statute.
The plaintiff saved several excep
tions and tho case will bo taken to tho
supremo court on exceptions.
Dr. lieorge li. Anderson of Brattle
boro, who attended Mr. Staten, testi
fied at length at tlio afternoon session
to the nature of tho wounds. Harold
Akley of Vernon testified that Collins
had been drinking heavily several
days. C. E. Allen of this town gavo
similar testimony.
Collins, himself, testified that ho
had been discharged from the einnlov
of the Xow Haven railroad because
of his drinking habits and said that
while lie did not doubt that lie s'.iot
.Mr. Sfuton ho has no recollection of
the events of that Sunday morning.
snerill c. L. .Mann of Brattleboro
testified to arresting Collins and Depu-
A .. Cll.!Y St T Tr. !,., .
iy oiierui kj. i. jvnapp oi tu'.s town
testified as to the distances between
several points at the scene of tho
shooting.
This case began yesterday mornine.
The shooting took placo Juno 8, 1913.
Collins was arrested and later sen
tenced to the state prison in Windsor
for not moro than nine years and not
less thnn soven. Ho was in court
yesterday, having been brought from
prison on a habeas corpus writ hy
Sheriff C. E. Mann to appear as a wit
ness in the case.
Tho suit is brought under Section
4500 of tho Public Statutes, which pm
vidw, amoiloiihjuUJiuhat. iuxiJP,
roau shall bo liable for "damages si!?
tained by a person by any act of an
employe who is retained mi tho employ
of a railroad corporation when it is
known to the officials of the road that
ho uses intoxicating liquor.
It is claimed by tho plaintiff that
Collins was intoxicated at the timo ot
tho assault and that he had been in
toxicated tho day beforo and fined for
tho offense and that Mr. Staten, hav
ing been a witness against him at tho
timo of that hearing, was a victim of
his revenge.
The defendant company claims that
Collins had been employed only as a
substitute and that at tho time of tho
shooting ho was not on duty and that
the company, therefore, is not liablo
for damages.
The forenoon witnesses were H.
A. Staten, who was wounded by Col
lins; Mrs. Staten, tho plaintiff's wife,
who ran to his assistanco; Mrs. M. I.
Heed, who was an eye witness of the
shooting; A. G. Barnes, a neighbor who
was early on the scone, and Bert Stone,
who had knowledge of liquor that Col
lins had.
A. F. Schwenk and P. E. Barber ap
peared for Staten and John W. IJed
moiid of Newport and Charles F. Black
of St. Albans for the railroad company.
Tho jury that heard tho case of
Marion Howo of Brookline against tho
Central Vermont Railroad Co,, a suit
to recover $10,000 for personal injuries
as the result of a collision last Sep
tember between the automobile of
Herbert H. Howe, grandfather of tho
plnintiff, and a West River branch
pnssenger train, returned at 0.20
Friday night- a verdict for $7S0.7S.
Tho jury was out about five hours.
Tho case had been on trial all tho
week.
The plaintiff was the three-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Howe
and was being held iu the nrms of her
grandmother, Mrs. Nora Howe, wifo
of tho owner and driver of the car,
when the engino hit the automobilo as
it was crossing tho tracks at tho up
por crossing at West Townshend.
Court took a recess to Monday af
