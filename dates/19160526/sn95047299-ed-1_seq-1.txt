"Uncle Sum.
The application of the term "Uncle
Sam" to the United States had its be
ginning in Troy, N. Y., during the war
of 1812. A commission contractor of
iroy named Elbert Anderson had a
shop in which the stocks were always
examined anu passed by a government
inspector called Samuel Wilson, who
was generally known as "Uncle Sam."
When the boxes were passed they were
always marked with the initials of tho
contractor and the nation, "EA-US."
One day the man who was doing tho
marketing was asked what the initials
stood for and replied jokingly that they
were the initials of the contractor and
of "Uncle Sam." The joke spread
among the men, got into print and long
before the cud of the war had become
known nil over the country. Mr. Wil
son, the original "Uncle Sam," died in
Troy In 1854. -New York Times.
Match Sticks.
Certain kinds of matches are shaved
with the grain from sawed blocks.
Others are cut both ways by saws. In
still further varieties the blocks aro
boiled to malic them cut easily. By
some machines a boiled or steamed log
is revolved on Its own axis, and a
shaving tho thickness of a match is
cut round and round. This shaving is
at the same time cut into lengths and
split into match sticks. It may be said
that there is hardly a limit to tho vari
eties of methods employed. Round
matches are made by forcing them
through dies. Harper's.

A special meeting' was held; aft
the Board of Trade Rooms last Mon.
day night, called by patriotic citi
zens interested in providing- better
school facilities for the children of
Palatka.
Perhaps you have noticed the illus
trations prepared by Fred Cochrane
and which for some days have been
on exhibition in the Ackerman-Stew-
art window. It shows some of the
magnificent school buildings provid
ed by other cities and towns in
Florida, many of them being of less
importance than Palatka. Towns of
only half the size have high school
buildings costing from $50,000 to
.?75,000.
There is also shown a view of Pa.
latka's cheap, insignificant high school
building. ihis is our one deeD dis
grace. Once we strove and failed.
Now is the time to make another
try. This meeting Monday night
was to arouse an interest and to
organize for one supreme effort for
a new school.
Fred Cochrane was stuffed as full
as a leather cushion with school
building statistics. He showed that
for Palatka to bond for $100,000 would
only cost each tax payer but about
30 cents on the $1,000 of his prop
erty. Herman F. Leeks, a prince among
pluggers for advanced ideas in
schools and other good things, was
made chairman of the meeting.
E. M. Earnest, who has been a
plugger for Palatka ever since he
struck the old town, was there and
made a ringing speech. Mr. Ear
nest is now in a position where he can
do effective work. He is the new
chairman of the Palatka special tax
school district trustees. Watch him.
Col. Dinneen, the man who inter
viewed Mr. Mellon and made an ef
fort to elongate his leg, reported
that that gentleman would come
across with a liberal donation pro
vided. This proviso will be respect
ed. Palatka thinks a heap of James
R. Mellon, and will weigh his
wishes with all the consideration due
to the man.
But we are going after that
school. You, fellow citizens, are ex
pected to ENLIST. Don't wait to bs
drafted.
Last of Dance Series.
To the music of Chattaway's or
chestra, about twenty couples of Pa
latka's young society circle danced
Wednesday evening in the Club House.
Light, airy frocks and Palm Beach
suits made a delightful picture to the
onlookers. This is the last party of
tho series of the season's dr.nces and
the affair was thoroughly enjoyed.
During the intermission, lemonade
and sandwiches were served.
The Hollister Picnic.
Died in the Night, Alone.
Mooney & Davis, undertakers, have
forwarded the remains of Thomas Mc
Donald, who died sometime during the
night of last Monday alone in his
home at Orange Mills, to his brother,
Mr. John McDonald, of Syasset, Long
Island, New York.
Deceased was a member of the B.
P. O. E. of Norwalk, Conn., as papers
found in his home indicated. Elks of
this city assisted in arranging for and
discovering the whereabouts of his
relatives. He was found by neigh
bors who missed him. They saw a
light burning in his house and went in
only to find him dead. He lived alone,
arfd little was known concerning him.
Mooney & Davis were notified and
they took charge of the body.
Mind the Mayor's Wishes.
Mayor Merriam has issued a sensi
ble proclamation. His honor doesn't
issue many of them, but when he does
you can bet on its being needed.
It is in another column. He wants
you to clean up. He wants it done
today and tomorrow, so that when the
visitors begin to arrive on Sunday and
Monday thev will be confronted with
a clean town. Isn't that sensible.

to do this. These women see these

PROGRESSING FINELY
Committee on Arrangements
Will be Ready for Record
Crowd.
Indications are that Palatka will be
Taxed to the Limit Visitors coming
from all Parts of County.
The committee of arrane-emfinta
for the big political barbecue to wel
come the btate Candidates have every
thing in readiness for the bier event.
Out at the Burt lot on the Riverside
Lnve, unuer tne giant oaks, the ta
bles are being built, together with
the speakers stand.
Julius Neubeck. exnert harhpnno
chef, has selected his beef and 'pork
ers, and they are of the best speci
mens raised in Florida. He will
have the meat barbecued to the
queen s taste, and has selected as his
chiet lieutenant and assistant M. O
Osteen, who is also some punk when
it comes to barbecuiner a steer.
It will be the big political rally of
me year, ah ot the Drominent
State and lOpngressiona (candidates
will be present and some of them
are orators.
There is one exception. Rev. Sid
ney J. Catts, now prominent as a
gubernatorial candidate, will proba
bly not be present. He has been
called to Birmingham, Ala., to the
bedside of a dying son. This will
disappoint many of his friends here.
Of course there is a possibility that
ne may yet come.
Jack Becks, chairman of the com.
mittee on arrangements, says that
letters and enquiries received all
indicate that the people from the
country sections will simply pour
into town to hear these eminent
men.
This committee has sent invita
tions to every State and National
candidate, and while these were sep
arated by the State Executive Com
mittee and given separate ltinenes, it
is likely, owing to the immensity of
the affair planned, that the Senatorial
candidates will be here as well as the
candidates for Governor, Congress
men and the minor State offices.
Surely it is Palatka's purpose to
provide a good old-fashioned feed for
all visitors. Their intellectual and
political food will come from the vis
iting candidates. - There is a chance
for overfeeding in either case .

School on Monday
Night.
Palatkan Joins Navy.
William E. Bailey Jr., of this city
has just passed his examinations for
service in the U. S. Navy and is now
in the training school for the navy at
Portsmouth, Va. Mr. Bailey had long
wanted to enter this department of the
service, but by reason of being a little
off in weight in proportion to his
splendid physique, was advised to de
fer for a time. A week ago Tuesday
the time seemed to have arrived, and
he went to the recruiting office in Sa
vannah, where he passed a splendid
preliminary examination. From Sa
vannah he was sent to Atlanta, where
he passed his final examination and
was admitted. Young Bailey wants
to take the electrical engineering
course provided in the navy for young
men so inclined, and from Atlanta was
sent to Portsmouth, Va., where he is
now at work in the training school.
Mr. Bailey lived for many years at
Satsuma Heights and his many friends
on the peninsula will be pleased at his
success. His parents are now living
in this city, his father being engag
ed with Mr. Newton in the harness
business on Lemon street.
Rev. Dr. C. M. Alford. pastor of
the Presbyterian church, and one of
the most eloquent pulpit orators in
.Florida, delivered the following ap
propriate address at the closing exer
cises of the Putnam High School at
Howell Theater last Monday night:
You are standing on the threshold
of active life; you have been tarrying
in tne scnool until your elastic ca
pacities should harden into the bone
and sinue of intellectual manhood.
Like the war-horse, which snuffeth
the battle from afar, your hearts beat
high with the generous impulses of
youth.
Permit me to say that you have
been pursuing your studies in the best
schools ot the world. The state
schools far surpass all other elemen
tary schools. Church schools cannot
compare with them. In fact church
schools of the elementary grade only
exist in order to teach the peculiar
tenents of their faith. If parents
wish their children to spend their
time in learning the catechism of
some church, send them to the church
school; if they wish them to receive
a GOd foundation for hni scnolar
ship, and practical business and pro
fessional life, send them to the public
school. American citizens! btand by
the public school! Defend tho puoha
school against any power that may
rise up against it.
Thousands of years ago two races
of men planted the germs of all the
civilization and culture we possess-
viz, the Egyptians and the Greeks.
With the Egyptians learning was a
mystery. It was subdivided into
branches, and these were the exclu
sive hereditary property ot families.
They shared the things they knew
neither with each other nor the world.
The result was that their arts and
learning have perished. Their pyra
mids, obolisks temples and sphinxes
testify to the grandeur of their age;
but of their sages, philosophers and
poets, not even a name survives. On
the other hand, the education of
Greece was free and open to all. Her
schools, colleges and gymnasiums had
doors on every side, all she knew or
discovered was the common property
of the world. Men came from all
parts of the world to Athens the
greatest educational centre of all
time. Demosthenes and bocrates,
Plato and Aristotle, Pericles and Lc-
onidas are household names to-day.
Although dead, they still instruct in
the studio, teach in the college, leg
islate in the senate, and fight in the
field. The art, eloquence, philosophy,
literature and patriotism of Greece,
have been the inspiration administra
tion and despair of all succeeding gen
erations. On these broad free line3
we have established our school system.
All that the most intelectual men of
our day know, we wish to give out
to the future citizens of our land.

Do not forget to cut out the cou

You will be. surprised to see how
quickly the votes count up as each
coupon is equal to ten votes.
The only advantage one church,
lodge, school or society has over an
other is the advantage of an early
start. The different organizations
that enter now will naturally receive
the benefit that comes to the ones who
move quickly, still, jf they are deter

You are beginning vour educational

The highest aim of a moral being
under the government of God must be
external to himself.. .His highest law
of action is to make all personal im

Word From Mrs. M. V. Millard.
Mrs. M. V. Millard, whose beautiful
home on the shore of pretty Mariner's
ake a little out trom Interlachen, was
center ot gracious hospitality and
culture during the few years she lived
there, and who since the death of her
husband has been making her home
with her distinguished son-in-law, Dr.
Juttertield, at Amhurst, Mass., writes
to The News that she has gone to Al-
burqurque, New Mexico, to reside with
nother daughter, Mrs. Berry, whose
husband only recently died there.
Her letter will be of interest to
ninny of our readers, especially thosa
l vi tig in the Interlachen section. She
says:
"You no doubt noticed among your
nterlachen items that my son-in-law.
Mr. Berry, whose home was here, had
passed away, and that I was sent for
to comfort my daughter. Mr. Berry
came here about seven years ago on
account of tubercular tendencies. To
all appearances he had won out in a
restored health and was filling an im
portant position as auditor for ths
electric light and telephone company,
when he was suddenly taken ill, and
so quickly did the death messenger
come that he only survived three
weeks. Mr. Berry and daughter
spent a year with us in Interlachen.
i "Alburqurque is a wonderful city
1 of 15,000 inhabitants, located out in
the desert with its steeples in the
clouds. Everything indicates western
rush and hurry. It is a great health
resort. Five large sanitariums here
