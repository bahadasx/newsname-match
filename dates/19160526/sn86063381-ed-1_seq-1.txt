HIGHWAY ON LAKE SHORE
Lycan Votes Against Resolution
M. & I. Promises Big
Legal Battle.
Mayor Charles Vanaersluis has re
turned the resolution passed by the
city council for the establishment of
the Nymore highway across Second
street and along the lake shore, unap
proved. The resolution, however, be
comes effective on account of lapse
of time.
Not Right Step.
Mayor Vandersluis stated today
that he did not approve the project
because he did not believe that it
was the right step to take. He be
lieves that the present Nymore high
way can be made safe.
The construction of the new high
way along the present route, it' is
pointed out, may also save the city
much expense as the Minnesota & In
ternational railway promises a big
legal battle if efforts are made to
open up Second street. The railway
claims that the opening of Second
street will make the present railway
yards valueless.
Lycan Opposed.
At the meeting of the council all
the aldermen with the exception of
Aldermen Lycan and Phillippi voted
for the resolution. Alderman Lycan
voted against the resolution and Al
derman Phillippi was absent.
At the meeting of the council next
Monday evening appraisers may be
appointed for the Second street pro
ject.

returned' unapproved is as follows:

CLAPP FOR SENATOR.
United States Senator Moses
Clapp for re-election.
We are for Senator Clapp because
we like him and we believe that he
is the best fitted for the office.
That Senator Moses B. Clapp has
always been in accord with public
sentiment, and that his votes in the
U. S. senate have been recorded as a
majority of the people of the state
would have registered their own
opinions, is a fact clearly borne out
by the official records.
In the broad struggle which always
has existed, and exists today, be
tween the efforts of the few to con
trol the government in their interest,
and the welfare of the many for
whom government was really insti
tuted, a struggle which formed an im
portant part of those great policies
which came to be known as "The
Roosevelt Principles," the senator
took an active part, and was an advo
cate of those measures which became
laws, and which were approved by
the majority of the voters.
The first thing of importance taken
up by Senator Clapp, when he en
tered the senate, was the effort to
amend the Constitution so that U. S.
senators should be elected by a di
rect vote of the people. He was an
uncompromising champion of this
amendment and the first U. S. sena
tor from Minnesota to make speeches
in favor of popular election of sena
tors.
During his present term, on July
31, 1913, Senator Clapp made this
statement on the floor of the senate:
"During my comparatively short
service in this body, I recall the plea
I made for the right of the American
people to elect senators of the United
States, by direct vote, and I was met
with much scorn and derision by
members of this body at that time,
that one distinguished senator could
show his contempt in no other way
than by arising in his place and
leaving this chamber."
In 1903, Senator Clapp, as a mem
ber of the great committee on inter
state commerce, had charge of the
anti-rebate and anti-discrimination
bills, and on February 3 of that year
he called up and put through the
anti-rebate bill. This law was at
tacked and had to run the gauntlet
of the courts, but was sustained at
every point. Subsequently 'nearly
all the suits brought against com
binations were brought under this
law. In 1906, when there was such
a protracted struggle in the senate
over the Hepburn bill, which finally
gave the Interstate Commerce com
mission the right to fix rates, Clapp
and Dolhver were the leading advo
cates of this legislation and its pas
sage was largely due to the efforts
of Senator Clapp.
Again in 1910, when a great ef
fort was made to repeal railroad leg
islation, Senators Clapp and Cummins
brought in the minority report con
demning the action of the majority
of the committee, and pointed out the
reactionary features of the proposed
legislation In the end, every item
they opposed was stricken out, ex
cepting the one providing for a com
merce court, and that was repealed
at the following session.
When the attempt was made in
1911 to subject the farmers of Min
nesota to free trade with Canada,
Clapp was a vigorous opponent of the
bill, speaking several times in oppo
sition.
Meanwhile he had risen to the po
sition of chairman of the committee
on interstate commerce, and about
the first thing he did was to offer
and pass a resolution providing for
an investigation into trusts and cor
porations engaged in interstate com
merce. This was followed by a far
reaching and exhaustive series of
hearings and investigations lasting
more than a year, and which finally
resulted in the passage of the Federal
trade commission bill and the Clay
ton anti-trust act.
All through the summer months
of 1912, when congress was in ses
sion, and when it was in recess,
Clapp, as chairman of a special com
mittee to inquire into the campaign
methods, and the contributions em
ployed in the presidential and con
gressional elections of 1904-1908,
and the primaries of 1912* conducted
one of the most sweeping inquisitions
in the history of congress. He sent
subpoenas to men who have played
big politics in a big way daring the
past decade, including a former presi
dent of the United States, and a for
mer candidate for that office United

New York, May 26.Roman Cath

witness stand yesterday before the
executive committee headed by Etate
Senator George F. Thompson and de
nied the charges of Mayor Mitchell
that they were involved in a conspir
acy to discredit the- eity administra
tion through an attack upon the de
partment of charities.
They made a counter allegation
that the mayor played a prominent
part in a conspiracy designed to dis
credit the administration of Catholic
orphanages. The priests asserted
that after discovering their tele
phones had been tapped they deliber
ately prearranged the conversation
and that they were successful in
their purpose.
While admitting certain parts of
the overheard conversation, which
were read to the committee yester-,
day by Mr. Mitchell, the witnesses
protested that his account of these
talks were in the. majji, inaccurate.
They contended that the language
used was not theirs.

FOR RED LAKE RIVER
Hines Resident, Candidate for Legis
lature, Writes Letter to
Editor.
FLOODS DOING MUCH
DAMAGE TO LANDS
Settlers Are Entitled to Action
On Part of the State
Legislators.
Charles S. Carter of Hines, a can
didate for representative from this
district, in a letter to the editor of
the Pioneer urges a petition of the
people to the state legislature asking
for a channel in the Red Lake river
so that floods in the Red Lake river
can be avoided.
His letter is as follows:
"One of the great and difficult
problems confronting the people of
Minnesota and our section in partic
ular is the proper control of the wa
ters of the streams running into the
Great Red Lake, the lake itself and
its outlet, Red Lake river.
Two Million Acres.
"The country drained by the afore
said waters comprises about two mil
lion acres of some of the most fertile
land in the state of Minnesota.
"The conditions of the water this
spring are such that it places in
jeopardy the property and in some
instances almost the-lives of settlers
in our county adjacent to said wa~
ters.
"The people of the country affected
are entitled to action on the part of
our state legislature, which, work
ing in connection with the township
and county affected and the Federal
government, ought to work out some
plan whereby the channel of the Red
Lake river could be deepened and
widened with perhaps some building
of dykes along in Clearwater county
and other points where necessary.
Channel is Necessary.
"The draining of a large area of
swamp land adjacent to Red Lake
ad the emptying^ }&&3r&t<
ly in the spring* info' Red Lake has
made it absolutely necessary that
work on the deepening and widening
of the channel of the Red Lake river
can be taken up in the near future.
"The result of the quickly empty
ing of the water from the drainage
ditches into Red Lake is that, the
outlet, not being of sufficient capa
city to carry away the additional
burden of water caused by the drain
age ditches. There is immediately a
backing up of the waters of the lake
into all of the rivers such as the
Batter river, Blackduck river, Tam
arack and Shotly rivers and there is
as a result a large area of land owned
by the citizens of the state and the
state itself which is overflowed and
causes a serious loss to the hay crop
and to transportation until the flood
tide recedes.
A Definite Program.
"Let us start with a definite pro
gram, and petition of the people ask
ing for a channel in the Red Lake
river starting from the lake and go
ing 25 miles west which could be
made at a cost of approximately $6,-
000 per mile under the twenty-year
state drainage law. This would
mean $7,500 per year. The $2,500
per year would be paid by the state
at large under the established rule
of the state drainage department, as
well as the law. $2,50D per year
from the Federal government from
its river and harbor fund and $2,500
from land owners from both sides of
the river, whether they be red or
white. In the latter case this would
average about 32 cents per 40-acre
tract per year against the lands of
the whites or the reds.",
