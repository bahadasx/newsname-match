TO JOIN A WORLD
COURT FOR PEACE
Former President Explains
More to League Today.
Deals With Legal Questions
and Avoids War Talk.
NO AMENDMENT IS NECESSARY
Present Constitution Permits
Membership, Says Speaker.
Would Not Curtail Power of
President and Congress,
Washington, May 26. The object of
the League to Enforce Peace is not to
urge President Wilson to take steps
to stop the present war, former Presi
dent Taft. president of the league, de
clared today in opening its two day
sessions. "We are not here," he
said, "to urge upon President Wilt-on
steps to stop the present war. Not
that we are not hopeful that such
steps may be taken and not that we do
not look with the greatest satisfaction
on any indications that the war is to
come to an end, but we believe that a
definite purpose, a purpose with limi
tations for an association like this is
much more likely to be realized than
a general platform for the benefit of
humanity."
The league hoped, Mr. Taft said, for
a world agreement on a method to
make war less probable.
"We are met," he continued, "to
hear the various proposals. These pro
posals are a working hypothesis which
we wish to present to the people of
the United States for their support, so
that those who represent us in an in
ternational conference may know that
the good people of the United States,
in a majority are back of them."
Washington, May 26. Acceptance
of mombprship by the United States
in a world court In which the joint
powers would use their armed and
economic forces to enforce its decrees
in the interest of international peace
was urged today by former President
Taft, before the League to Enforce
Peace, of which he is president.
While Mr. Taft urged the future
formation of such a world court he
refrained from discussing the causes
of the present war or the part this
nation may play in attaining peace.
His address was closely confined to
the technical legal Questions involved
injoinder by the United States in such ;
an international tribunal. He denied j
that such action would curtail the i
power and authority of either the i
president or congress by limiting the ,
constitutional discretion of the latter .
body to declare war. j
Mr. Taft explained that the league's
platform proposes compulsory sub
mission to the world court of an in
ternational dispute not settled by
diplomatic negotiation and which are
justifiable questions. Referring to the
so-called Bryan peace treaties with
England and Prance, Mr. Taft said it
was argued that the arbitration stip
ulation in them was a delegation of
authority of the presiden and senate

WANTS BABY BACK
Acquitted, Mrs. Matters
news Fight for Child.
Re-
Fail to Convict Trio of Foisting
Heir on Estate.
Chicago, May 26. The fight Miss
Margaret Ryan of Ottawa, Ont., is
making for the child she claims is
hers, and which Mrs. Anna Dollie
Ledgerwood Matters acquitted last
night on charges of conspiracy to
foist a spurious heir, on the probate
court, declares is hers, will come up
next Wednesday in the United States
court. Judge Land is allowed a con
tinuance when the case came up to
day. The hearing today was under a writ
of habeas corpus sought by Margaret
Ryan, who claims that she and not
Mrs. Matters gave birth to the baby
in dispute.
Upon application of the attorneys
for the prosecution, the defendants
must again face trial on charges of
perjury and fraudulently producing
an heir.
This trial has been set for May 29.
Tried to Get Husband's Estate.
The trial of Mrs. Anna Dolly Ledger
wood Matters. Charles T. Mellon and
Harry Edwards arose from an effort
to obtain control of the entire estate
of the late husband of Mrs. Matters,
Frederick Matters, a banker and mov
ing picture theater owner, through the
alleged imposition of a spurious
posthumous heir on the probate court.
There were two hearings in the po
bate court. On the first occasion Dr.
L. C. Emile Reroard and Miss Des
Rosieres. obstetrician and nurse, re
spectively, of the Misericordia hos
pital. Ottawa, Ont., where the alleged
posthumous heir was born, testified
that Mrs. Matters had give birth to a
child Ireane.
Confessed to Perjury.
James Matters, a brother of the de
cedent, contested the claim and last
December the doctor and the nurse
confessed to Judge Horner, of the pro
bate court that they perjured them
selves when the swore that Mrs. Mat
ters gave birth to h child in the Ot
tawa hospital.
They asserted the child in question
was born to Jessie Bryan, whose real
name is Margaret Ryan. She testified
that she was told that her baby was
dead. She said she believed the father
of her baby had gone to the war.
Indictments followed the confessions
of perjury. Dr. Beroard and Miss Des
Rosieres were jointy indicted with the
defendants, but proved to be the
state's chief witnesses and it is ex
pected they will be given immunity.
The trial began May 1 and the jury was
o( m dieted May 10.

TO SMOKE HUGHES OUT
Wisconsin Delegates Have Plan They
Hope Will Work.
Milwaukee, Wis., May 26. -The
I Wisconsin anti-LaFollette delegates to
j the Republican national convention
have taken a step which is expected
to result in forcing a statement from
j Justice Hughes on his attitude toward
j the presidential nomination.
The 11 conservative delegates voted
I to cast their ballots for Hughes, if
his position on national policies is
i satisfactory-"
j It is presumed that this action will
be understood as a delicate a sugges
tion to Hughes that he ought to de
clare himself, that he make some kind
of a statement through friends of his
attitude toward various problems of
the day.
The Wisconsin delegates do not
want to have their action taken as
anything but the most friendly step
toward his candidacy, but they be
lieve the manner in which this sug
gestion of a statement is phrased will
make it possible for him to declare
himself without being in. the position
he so much fears of involving the su
preme bench in politics.

T.R. TO COME OUT?

Hughes Is " Eliminated, Say
Many Republican Adherents.
Oyster Bay, May 26. Arrange
ments are being made by the Repub
lican pilgrims, expected here on Sat
urday, to tell Colonel Roosevelt that
there is a united movement through
out the country for his nomination on
the Republican ticket. It is believed
that ihe delegation will be largo and
the residents are preparing to make
the visit a sort of pre-convention noti
fication meeting.
Colonel Roosevelt is to make an ad
dress and it is expected that it will be
one of his most important utterances.
It is hinted that he will leave no doubt
as to his attitude, - now that Justice
Charles E. Hughes has persisted in
his refusal to talk about preparedness.
Many Roosevelt adherents say that
Hughes is eliminated and that the
time for him to speak is past. Coming
as it does a few hours before Colonel
Roosevelt starts for Chicago. Kansas
City and St. Louis Sunday afternoon,
the rally at Sagamore Hill will mark
the beginning of the battle. From that
moment there will be "something do
ing" every minute until convention
time. The word "silence" will be de
leted from the colonel's lexicon.
Mr. Roosevelt worked Thursday on
his addresses for the tour and talked
preparedness with Mary Roberts
Rinehart, the writer. Mrs. Rinehart
said that "cyclonic" was a word she
had put down in her notebook to be
used later in a description of the way
the colonel passed the day and treated
the stream of visitors who sought in-
t terviews.
WAS ITSUICIDE?
Kansan in 3fgvy Electrocuted

Commander of IT. S. Destroyer
Grabs Live Wires.
Sag Harbor, L. I., May 26. Lieut.
Clarence Alvin Richards, cdmmander
of the United States destroyer Fan
ning, was instantly killed by an elec
tric shock in the station of the Sag
Harbor Light and Power company
here early today. Harry D. Christian,
nightwatchman at the station, said it
appeared to him that the lieutenant
deliberately committed suicide by tak
ing hold of two heavily charged
wires. Lieutenant Richards was ao-
j pointed to the navy from Kansas and
j was 34 years old.
i The Fanning was one of a fleet of
war vessels which has been maneuver
ing ir. Gardiner's bay, making head
quarters here, but the vessels were
under orders to leave for Newport at
3 a. m. Why Lieutenant Richards
j was ashore after the sailing time is
! unknown.
Christian said the Lieutenant came
to the power station two hours before
the fleet was to sail and said he was a
government inspector. He pushed
Christian aside and, walking into the
station, picked up two wires, receiving
the shock that killed him
Lieut. J. C. Jennings, commanding
the shore station, who took charge of
j the body, declined to give any ir.for
i matien other than he would report to
the navy department.
FIVE HUNDRED
KANSANS GOING
TO CONVENTION
Largest Jayhawker Delegation
in History to Chicago.
Erery Well Known Republican
and Moose Leader Will Go.
WOMEN WILL LOOK ON, TOO
Fair Kansans Will Participate
in the Big Parade.
Committeeman Swamped With
Demand for Tickets.
Probably 500 Kansans will go to
Chicago in June a majority of them
with a-more or less vain hope that
they will be able to land tickets from
some imaginary or unknown sources
and attend the Republican and Pro
gressive national conventions. It will
probably be the biggest crowd Kansas
ever sent to a convention city. Al
most every well known Republican
and "Progressive leader in the
state will go to' the convention and ;
several hundred citizens and patriots
from the ranks will add materially to
the number of Kansans who will try
to see the big show. j
Beginning with the middle of next i
week Kansas politicians will begin '
their pilgrimage to the scene of polit- .
ical activities. Nearly all of the po- ;
litical leaders secured hotel reserva- '
tions weeks ago. . The sight-eeing 1
crowd, however, was less thoughtful.
Many of them will "wait until their ar
rival in Chicago before they look for
sleeping quarters. All of which will
probably mean that Kansas will con
tribute her share of pilgrims who will
seek sleep and rest in chairs in the ho
tel lobbies.
Fred B. Stanley of Wichita, Repub
lican national committeeman for this
state, has been swamped with de-
ma rids for tickets to the Republican
national convention. He has recorded
requests from several hundred Kan
sas men and women who desire to see
the big shrrw and it is probable that
a majority tof them will be disappoint
ed, as the demand fcr tickets is far in
excess of the allotment. Interest in
the presidential fight has attracted
both men and women from every dis
trict in the state.
Many Women Gotng.
The big suffrage demonstration In
Chicago, during convention week is at
tracting many suffrage workers from
this state A majority of the women
who expect to participate in the parade
have also made demand on delegates
or on the national com mitt e roan for
tickets
Demands for tickets is not confined
to the Republican convention. William
Allen White, Progressive national
committeeman, is also having trouble.
First the state increased her number
of delegates from thirteen to thirty
four. All of them have declared they
will go to the convention. Most of
the alternates are also going. They
are assured tickets and there is no
desire to miss the Bull Moose circus,
when a faithful who has landed a
delegate or alternate's job is assured a
good seat.
Nearly all of the members of the
Republican delegation to Chicago will
make their headquarters at the Grand
Pacific hotel. Reservations for fifteen
of the twenty delegates have been
made at this hotel. The official head
quarters of the Republican delegation
from Kansas, however, will be main
tained at the Auditorium hotel.
Progressives will establish head
quarters in the LaSalle hotel. Nearly
the entire hotel was leased by George
W. Perkins and will be the official
headquarters of the Bull Moosers dur
ing their convention.
So intense us the interest in the na
tional conventions, that almost every
Kansas politician who can possibly
arrange his affairs will attend. Fred
J B. Stanley, present national commit
teeman, and D. W. Mulvane of To
! peka, former national committeeman.
will leave early next week for Chicago.
Mulvane will stay at the Congress as
will Governor Capper, who expects to
leave for the convention a few days
before the official opening June 7.
A number of the state officials may
accompany the Kansas crowd. W. E.
Davis, state auditor, and Earl Akers,
state treasurer, are planning to attend.
J. T. Botkin, secretary of state may
go.
One of the men most widely known
in Kansas politics is Morton Albaugh
of Topeka. Albaugh is a recognized
political wizard but in all his years
of activity in the game, he has never
seen a national convention. This year,
however, he is finding it difficult to
resist the temptation and Albaugh
may be among the crowd at the big
show.
Nearly all of the political writers
for Kansas newspapers will attend
both the Progressive and Republican
conventions and will go to St. Louis
for the Democratic convention which
opens June 14. In addition to the
reservations at press tables for regu
lar political writers, spaces will be
reserved for William Allen White,
Henry J. Allen and several other well
known writers of the state who will
"do" the presidential fight for syndi
cates or publications which have di
rectly engaged their services.

London. May 26. An Amsterdam
dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
company says that 18 women were
wounded in a fight between police and
food rioters at Frankfort-on-the-Main
Wednesday night according to a dis
patch received at The Hague.
The riot is said to have started1 ow
ing to a shortage of meat in the local
butcher shop. Three hundred and
fifty women who had been told there
was no meat for them marched
through streets carrying black famine
flags and singing socialistic songs.
The women forced their way into
one butchershop although it was
guarded by soldiers and policemen.
After a search they found some meat
which they cut up and continued
their march holding the pieces above
their heads. Police attempted to take
the meat from the women and a gen
eral fight followed in which the offi
cers used their swords.
One woman was arrested for shout:
ing "Down with the emperor." A
local paper which referred to the af
fair was ordered suspended for two
months.

Field Headquarters Near Kamiqui
pa, Mexico, May 26. Candelario Cer
vantes, the Villa bandit leader, was
killed by American troops south of
Cruces today.
Cervantes' end came after he had
made a surprise attack south of Cru
ces on a detachment of engineers, re
pairing the motor truck road. He was
beaten back and pursued into the hills
by the engineers who had been rein
forced by a detachment of the Seventh
infantry. One other Mexican, Jose
Bencorne, and one American were
killed. Two Americans were wounded.
Ilulett Killed Both Bandits.
Private George O. Hulett was the
hero of the fighting. He brought
down both of the bandits killed.
Cervantes's home is at Namiquipa.
He has been a thorn in the side of the
army in northern Chihuahua ever
since the expedition began. His death
probably means the breaking up of
the Villa bands in this section.
Second to Villa.
San Antonio, May 26. Mexico
Candelario Cervantes, styled by Gen
eral Funston today as "Second in im
portance only to Villa," was killed
yesterday in a skirmish near Cruces.
The American loss was Corporal
Davis Marksbury, killed, and Privates
George F. Nicholson and George Hu
lett, wounded. Jose Bencorne was
another Mexican killed. The re
mainder of the band was pursued and
dispersed.
General Pershing reported that sev
en men of the machine gun company
of the Seventeenth infantry, two en
gineers and an employee of the quar
termaster department were six miles
southeast of Cruces, when attacked
yesterday by 20 Mexicans under Cer
vantes. The Americans had been
looking for cattle and correcting road
maps when the Mexicans appeared.
The ten Americans fought the Mexi
cans for 45 minutes. After their lead
er fell, the Mexicans retreated and
were followed into the hills by the de
tachment of cavalry that arrived from
Cruces.
General Pershing appeared elated
by the success of his men in disposing
of Cervantes, who he said, was im
plicated in the Columbus raid and had
been an active bandit.
PRESIDENT MAY SPEAK
Wilson Will Attend Banquet of Peace
League Saturday Night.
Washington. May 26. President
Wilson has confided to his advisers, it
was learned today that he hopes to
make an address before the League to
Enforce Peace here tomorrow night.
That will be of importance in con
nection with peace. While he is ex
pected to deal primarily with a dis
cussion of methods of maintaining
peace after the European war has
ended, it is understood he will also
touch . upon the immediate situation
abroad.
The president will sit through the
banquet of the league at which he will
speak, instead of following his usual
custom of arriving just in time for
the speaking. He wants to learn as
much as possible about the purpose of
the organization as he agrees with its
general object of forming a league of
nations, backed y a common police
force to maintain the peace of the
world. "

IT HAS MANY ASSURANCES
Those From Favorite Son
States for the Colonel
After the Complimentary Vot
ing1 Has Been Done-
New York, May 26. The Roosevelt
Republican committee has sent an ap
peal to every delegate to the Chicago
convention to support Colonel Roose
velt for the presidency.
Chairman George von L.. Meyer, in
explaining why the appeal was made,
said:
"The work of our committee has
been to bring home to each Republi
can delegate the great opportunity
that the Republican party has at this
time to perioral a real service to the
country by nominating Colonel Roose
velt. A large number of delegates
from favorite son states have assured
me that they are ready to support
Colonel Roosevelt as soon as they
have cast a complimentary vote for
their candidate.
"These delegates realize the present
critical situation calls for a national
figure and are prepared to act on this
at the proper time."
NO PEACE MOVE
Wilson Noncommittal to Call
ers Urging Action.'
Looks With Favor on Inviting
Nations to Confer.
Washington, May 26. President
Wilson told callers today that the in
tervention of a neutral in behalf of
peace in Europe could rest only on a
mutual understanding by the bellig
erents, that terms to be arranged are
to conserve the interests of all, and of
the world at large, rather than those
of a particular nation or group of na
tions among the warring powers. Mr.
Wilson did not disclose any dfinite
plan of action he may have formulated
in regard to peace, nor authorize a
formal statement of his attitude.
Mr. Wilson pointed out to his call
ers that there are many elements in
the situation in Europe all of which
must be taken into account in con
sideration of peace proposals. While
he is eager to see the conflict ended
as soon as possible the White House
visitors were able to gather no im
pression that a move by the United
States to bring it about is at least in
immediate prospect.
Discusses Hr-nsloy Bill.
Representative Hensley of Missouri,
discussed with Mr. Wilson his amend
ment to the naval bill adopted by the
naval committee authorizing the
president to invite other nations to
participate In a conference at the
close of the war with the object of
setting up a court or other tribunal
to settle international disputes. Mr.
Hensley told the president he believed
this amendment made the naval bill
as assurance to foreign nations that
the United States was arming for de
fense only not for offensive I'Urpose
and was ready to enter into an agree
ment to settle international disputes
amicably.
The president did not commit him
self definitely on the adoption but
Hensley gained the impression hat he
was favorable to the general prin
ciples involved-

WITNESS STAND
Is Not Pleading Insanity; Isn't
Crazy, He Says.
Women Excluded From Court
Room on His Request.
"I WANTED THEIR MONEY!"
Arch Poisoner Confesses on
Trial Without Tremor. .'?'
His Plot Was to Murder Three,
Including His Wife.
New York, May 26. Dr. Arthur W.
Waite told an alienist engaged for his
defense in his trial for the murder of
John E. Peck, the Grand Rapids mil
lionaire, that he had intended to kin
his wifei Clara Peck Waite, and that
he married her only for her money,
according to testimony given by the
alienist. Dr. Morris J. Karpas, today.
Dr. Karpas added that Waite said ha
did not intend to stop at anything to
gain his end. . r.
Previously, under cross examination,
Waite has told the prosecutor he was
not sure that he would not have killed
his wife.
Waite declared he did not think ha
was crazy and denied that he had at
any time pretended he was insane;
denied that he had ever told the
prosecutors that "the man front
Egypt" had killed Mr. Peck and
swore that he slept perfectly after the
murder. He declared that he had
wanted to kill himself and "made a
pretty good attempt at it."
Alienist Says He's Egoist.
Accused of planning to leave the
country with Mrs. Margaret Horton;
he did not deny it, but said he "did
not know that" they were going away.
Dr. Waite declined to admit that he
had made himself appear worse than
he was in order to convince the jury
that he was insane. The alienists for
Waite testified that he did not appear
to be mentally well and that he was
abnormal in that all his interests
were centered in himself.
Women Excluded From Room
Women were excluded from the
court room when Dr. Arthur Waite re
sumed the witness stand today. Hun
dreds of persons in the corridors vain

seemed to have braced himself to face
the ordeal. His counsel, Walter R.
Deuel, told Justice Sheran that he had.
only a few more questions to ask tha
dentist before the cross-examination
would begin.
"Did you ever try to kill your
wife?" asked Mr. Deuel.
"No." replied Dr. Waite.
"Did you ever plan to kill her?
"No, never."
"You never thought you might kUl
her ?'
"I am not sure that I would not
