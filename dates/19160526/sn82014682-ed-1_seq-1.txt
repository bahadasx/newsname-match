perado was killed today.
-Before an end was put to" the
man, he had shot and killed Police
Serjeant John Moriarity.
" The trouble began when the man
attempted to pass counterfeit coins
on a strcetar. The conductor re
fused to. accept the coins and an
altercation arose, the police being
summoned. Sergeant -Moriarity was
first on the scene and attempted to
arrest the counterfeiter, who sud
denly drew a revolver and shot the
officer down, j
" ' A chase ensued in which police
and citizens joined, the desperado
fleeing to a'liouseboaf on the bay
below Potrero Heights and taking
"refuge there. He barricaded doors
and windows and refused to sur
render, shooting at everyone who
appeared in' sight.

afternoon by M. Hanihara, newly ap

San Francisco. He Is a passenger on
the Tenyo Maru, which left for San
Francisco this morning.
Asked about Japan's attitude to
ward China Mr. Hanihara said Suavely
that he is not In a position to express
an opinion.
"The present condition of China,"
he commented, however, "and Chinese
questions are alike chaotic and deli
cate Indeed In current International
affairs. The socalled revolutionary
armies were very active for a little
while, but were not doing much when
I left Japan.
It is Impossible to judge about
Chinese questions by the standards
applied elsewhere. Many times the
revolution has seemed on the road-to
accomplishment but each time the
various factions have compromised
before the revolution succeeded..
"That is the Chinese way of doing
things one day they are fighting each
other with all their might the ' next
day . they have compromised quickly
and easily.
"At the present the Yuan govern
ment Is able to tangle up the opposi

Yuan Shih-Kai at a meeting held in
Nanking.
When asked regarding the action of
th 'representatives at Nanking, Col -geq
D. J. Wudan, leader of the Na
tionalists in Hawaii, said: "This is
merely an agreement made by the
Yuan party to make believe that the
people want Yuan. It is easy to find
a represents tiv j to vote in favor of a
certain measure, but the representa
tives do not speik for the people.
"As an instance the representative
of Huaan voted in favor of Yuan while
80 per, cent of the people in that prov
ince ara opposed to him. In fact, only
trolled by Yuan, it is a move oi me
sort experienced when Yuan allowed
his representatives to hold a general
election. In thf meantime the, revolu
tionists are winning. That quite an
swers the Nanking conference."
