JEFFERSON DAVIS. 1
On June 3, 1808, in many parts of 1
the South, was celebrated the one '
hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Jefferson Davis. He was born* at '
what is now the village of F'
Kentucky. His father, Samuelffijljybs j
who served in the War of Intfmndence,
was of Welsh, and hfcjJSKBfr, 1
Jane Cook, of Scot-Irish -deHfilt. '
During: his infancy his family nKpd j
to Wilkinson countv, Missisgn^i.
where he spent the greater pfljKtfs j
Jefferson^Davli^was a proud,
he entered West Point. Havihg^oijw 1
pleted his course of study about 1828,
he was commissioned second lteuten- 1
ant and served as such in the Black
Hawk war. 1
In 1833 Davis married Miss Knox
Taylor, daughter of Zachary Taylor.
In September of the same year w!i?Ie
visiting in Louisiana to escape fever, 1
his wife died of it and Davis himself
was dangerously ill. Her untimely
ieath drove him to the verge of pro?- 1
tration. For the next year he trav2lled
to regain his health; and in the
spring of the following year he re- :
Lurned to his cotton plantation in Mississippi,
where he devoted his time
to reading political philosophy, public
law and English classics. By careful 1
management of his estate he acquired
considerable wealth. I
Then Mr. Davis entered the arena
af politics and exhibited great power
as a public speaker. The year fob 1
lowing this he married Miss Varin i 1
Howell of Mississippi*. About th:s 1
time he was chosen as lawmaker from ]
Mississippi. In less than a year after 1
te was chosen as the lawmaker, war <
iroke out in Mexico. Davis resigned <
lis position and went as colonel of a i
Mississippi regiment to fight for his 1
country. He threw himself into the 1
;onflict with a courage and ardor
which won for him laurels of gal- <
antry. <
Upon return to his home in 1847,
ie was appointed totfill a vacancy in
;he United States senate. He was
dected for a full term of six years
>ut resigned in 1851 to become a canli'date
of Democratic States-Right
jarty for (governorship of his State
igainst Foote, candidate for Union
Democrats. A temporary loss of eye
light interfered with his canvass and
ie was defeated by a small majority
\ few years following he was again
sleeted as a senator and continued as
i member until the secession of his
state in 18fil. As a senator, he stood
n the front rank of a body distinguished
for ability; his purity of
haracter and courteous manners, together
with intellectual (gifts, won
lim the esteem of all parties.
Davis was an ardent admirer of
lohn C. Calhoun and eventually be ame
his successor as leader of the
South. Wise and learned, honest and
ipri(ght in his life and a strong periuasi^
speaker made possible for him
o hold, day after vday, his place in
he senate, arguing and pleading for
ignts ana for justice from the North f
oward the South. His foes always c
ihowed him respect on account of his t
>ure character. \
In 1860 Pavis wrote out some res- c
dutions and read them to the senate. \
rhey expressed what the South un- a
lerstood the old Federal Union to ?
nean. These resolutions stated: 1
'1) that each one of the Statea had c
he full right to manage its own home
iffairs; (2) the management of ne- i
fro servants was left to the people 1
>f each State and (3) congress had ?

10 right to meddle with Southern men
when they took negro slaves into the
Western territories. When these res>lutions
had been offered, a large majority
voted for them as wise and
right, but the Republican party delied
the truth and wisdom of Davis'
;hird resolution. They wished to shut
>ut the slaves from all territories
jnder the control of congress, alhough
part of these lands had been
.von from Mexico by the swords of
Southerners.
President Pierce now chose Davis

He organized engineer eo:ulanies,
which explored and reported
>n several proposed routes for a railway
connecting the Mississippi valley
vith the Pacific ocean; he effected the
enlargement of the army and made
r.aterial changes in its equipment of
inns and ammunition.
In 1857 Davis was again chosen
senator from Mississippi. He to'd
die senate that the South would seedo
from the Union and on the 10th
>f January, 1861, not long after the
election of Lincoln, he argued before
the senate that the South could r.o
ionger remain in the Union with such
tiealment from the North. South
Carolina led the way on the 20th of
December, I860, and Mississipi followed
her. A few days after the
withdrawal of Mississippi Senator
Davis entered the senate chamber in
Washington to offer his farewell address.
The halls and doorways were
so crowded with people that he had
great difficulty in making hiS'way to
his se?&4 When he arose to speak a

Shat his State had gone out of the
Union and he would have to leave his
seat in the senate at Washington. He
said that Mississippi' had gone out in
order to preserve peace. "I am sure,"
continued Davis, "that I feel no hostility
toward you senators from the
North. I am sure there is not one
of you, whatever sharp discussion
there may have been between us, to
whom I cannot now say in the presence
of God, I wish you well. I,
therefore, feel the Southerner's desire
when I say that I hope and they hope
for peaceful relations with you,
though we part."
When Davis left the senate he went
back to his cotton farm in the South,
becoming once more a private citizen
in the State of Mississippi'. When
the Southern States seceded from the
Union, all eyes were drawn toward
Davis as best suited to guide the fortunes
of the new Confederacy and
with a deep sense of duty he obeyed
the call. He was inaugurated at
Montgomery, Alabama. Standing with
head uncovered on the portico of th^
mpftol, in that city, he took the oath
:>f office. In May, Richmond, Virginia,
was chosen to be the capitol of
the Confederacy and the president
went there to manage the work.
The Confederate president had
>nly a few old cannon and muskets
to give the Southern soldiers and he
?lso seemed slow in recognizing the
rircumstances of the Confederate
soldiers until ft was too late, thus
musing them to suffer.
When the end of the war came Jefferson
Davis was the most unpopular

ihame attached to him that when the
error of Lincoln's assassination madiened
the people, many of the North
vere quite ready to believe Davis a
jarty to the crime.
He was arrested and imprisoned
it Fortress Monroe for two years. To
i christian man like Davis, this was
in insult, as well as an injustice,
[n prison he was chained and treated
vith great severity. At the end of
wo years he was carried to Richmond
'or trial, where he was admitted to
>ail and, after remaining untried for
i year, was finally dismissed. Then
his proud man emerged from ohscurty
and sought to drown the mem>ries
of his unfortunate political ca
eer in a business venture. A merciess
fate still pursued him. His company
failed after a few years 'efort
and misfortunes. Ilereavements
>f one sort and another crowded
hickly upon him. One of his sons

sxecutive mansion during the war and
vas killed. Another died after a few
