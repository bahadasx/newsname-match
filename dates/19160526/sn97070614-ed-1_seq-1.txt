at the First M. E. church, Sunday
'morning and listened 'to, a .strong,
uplifting sermon by s Rev. , Hartley
CaiVsfleld upon "The Symbolism of

added to the' impressiveness of the
service. "" . . .:
' Headed by Eminent Commander
Silas M. Campbell and staff, the com
mandery, with about fifty swords in
line, marched from the asylum, under
the direct command of Captain Gen
eral Wade B. Camburn,' to the
church. Returning to the asylum,
a vote of appreciation was extended
to Rev Cansfield and the singers for
the inspiring service.
Mr. Cansfield -took for his text
words found in 1st Corinthians. 1:22,
23, 24: "For the Jews require a sign
and the Greeks seek after Wisdom,
"But we preach Christ Crucified,
unto the Jews a stumbling block,
and unto the Greeks foolishness;
"But unto them that are called,
both Jews and Greeks, the Power of
God, and the Wisdom of God."
In introducing his subject he spoke
follows:
"Wo are glad-to have with us this
morning so large a representation of
Class of 1917 O. H. S. .

fifty-eight students who have com
pleted such a part of the work as to
make It probable that they will re
ceive the coveted diplomas in June.
Final examinations may possibly
eliminate a name or two from this

sible for others to pass the required
sixteen units and graduate with the

Want Assessment Ordered.
A motion was filed in the circuit
cout and argued Monday, to reinstate
the case of Gaffney vs. the defunct
Owosso Motor company, which was
dismissed recently under the judicature
act because no progress had been made
in it in more than a year. Tbe suit is
brought to compel an assessment of
$30,000 against the stockholders in the
bankrupt company.
The company's liabilities at the time
it failed were $30,000 while its assets
were $108,000. Its assets were not avail
able, however; for the reason that they
consisted almost entirely of the patent,
designs and other things that could not
be converted into money. Gaffaey was
the referee in bankruptcy.
The motor company was organized a
number of years' ago among Owosso
tueu, to manufacture a small commer
cial truck. Only one or two trucks
were made, and the company went into
bankruptcy before long.
They claim that they baye been un
able to gejt personal service on some of
the many defendants. They recently
secured an order for publication how
ever, and will get service in this man

; CITY IN MICHIGAN
Its Growth, Progress and
Future Toasted at Im
j proveraent Asssocia
tion Banquet
Citizen and a Friend Honored Insar
ance Question Plainly Presented
' by lion. Milo D. Campbell.
The praises of Owosso as a city of
oyaity, determination, thrift and co
operation were sung in glowing
terms and her future was painted
brightly in the speeches at the fourth
annual booster banquet of the Im
provement association held at the
new armory Tuesday night. A crowd of
more than 350 mein, representing
nearly every following, attended and
by 1 their tremendous and enthusias
tic (applause as the speakers drove
tome their arguments for a contln
nation! of and increase in united ef
fors toward a better Owosso, re
newed their faith in the city.
The affair was a brilliant success
in every way. A spirit of optimism
pervaded the atmosphere and
boost was the keynote of the eve
ning. It surpassed all previous
banquets given by the association
and in all augurs well for the wel
farfc of Owosso.
; Reception Pleasing Feature
One of the most pleasing features
of a most pleasant evening, was the
cordial reception tendered W. K.
Prudden, of Lansing:, who a few
years back, was a friend in need, to
Owosso, and to 'A. M. Bentley, local
manufacturer and philanthropist,
who. has just returned from an ex
tended stay in the west. The evi
dent sincerity of the hospitality ex
tended to Mr. Prudden and of the
welcome given Mr. Bentley was con
vincing proof of the esteem and re
spect that Owosso people hold for
them.
The reception was held from 6
to 6:30 o'clock In the parlors on the
second floor. Practically all of those
who attended the banquet took ad
vantage of the opportunity to greet
tbe honored guests. Those in the
receiving line with Mr. Bentley and
Mr. Prudden were Milo D.
Campbell, Mayor De Young,
E. O. Dewey and II. B. Sturtevant.
president of the Improvement asso
ciation and C. E. Rigley Sr.
Banquet Hall Attractive.
Immediately after the reception,
the doors to the banquet hall were
thrown open, revealing long- rows of
tables, immaculately white and
sparkling with silver and glassware.
The speakers were seated at a long
table extending across the front of
the auditorium, the rest of the din
ers remaining standing while they
took their places. Jt the speakers
table were Toastmaster W. D. White
head, President Sturtevant, Mr.
Prudden, Mr. Bentley Mayor De
Young Milo D. Campbell, of Cold
water, the principal speaker of the
evening, Secretary Seegmlller, W. R.
Goodrich, Rep. John Y. Martin, W.

While the guests were filing in
and during the supper hour Rhode's
brothers' three-piece orchestra ren
dered catchy music.
Rev. J. Frank Green, pastor of the
Church of Christ, pronounced the
Invocation. '
The supper, catered by Chef R.g J.
Beehler, was served by the members
of Company II under the direction of
Capt. J. O. Tarker. It was an appetizing-
Spread and wras we,ll served.
Pres. Sturtevniit'M Remarks.
The repast over. President Stur
tevant called the assemblage to or
der briefly pointed out the fact that
co-operation and unity had enabled
the Improvement association to ac
complish much in the past and assert
ed that it was going to do more in
the future. lie declared that the
people were not unmindful of the
fact that only unity of purpose made
the magnificent new armory possible,
and expressed appreciation of what
the county and city had done
towards getting the building. He
also thanked Mr. Bentley for his
most generous Rift that made tho
luxurious swimming pool a reality,
Instead of a desire.
"I believe," said Mr. Sturtevant,
"that the people of Owosso are clos
er together today in their business
relations than ever before. Every
one is . for Owosso. When a com
mittee recently went out and in a
few hours raised $3,000 to defray
the expense of furnishing the new
armory, ample proof of this- was
plve'i. It was a remarkable demon-
Oration or unity.
Mr. Sturtevant then introduced
W. D. Whitehead, toastmaster of the
evening. Mr. Whitehead expressed
pleasure over the fact that the gath-
h rormtntlvo nn

efforts of the Improvement assocta

tion, and asserted that if all would
help, the association would grow to
unparalleled size and usefulness. He
said that the association is not In
tended for the business men alone,
but urged everyone with the welfare
of Owosso at heart to become an ac
tive member, to work for a bigger
and better Owosso, in every way.
Mnennerchor Sings.
Mr. Whitehead then called upon
the Owosso Maennerchor for a selec
tion. The German singers respond
ed in a manner that elicited hearty
and prolonged applause. They were
In excellent voice, and the harmony
was splendid. They were forced to
respond to an encore. They inter
spersed tne program with selections
and their singing was one of the big

hits of the evening. They sang un
der the direction of Chris Rentsehler.
Sec. Seegmiller Speaks.
The toastmaster introduced W. A.
Seegmlller, secretary of the associa
tion as "our live wire secretary.
whose only fault is that he is a Dem
ocrat." The speaker lived u to his
reputation of hitting on all twelve
cylinders without a miss., Mr. Seeg-
miller's speech was a report of the
activities of the association since
January 1, 1915, and a visualization
of what the future holds for Owosso.
He stated that on that date, there
was $3362.77 on hand and that' to
day there is balance of $38.08. He
gave a rapid. fire account of the var
ious ways in which the money was
expended, and enumerated what the
association had done since then.
Dropping into the retrospective, he
went back four years and read a list
prepared then by him, of the Im
provements desired in Owosso. They
were the Ann Arbor car shops, whole
sale bakery, appropriation for Mc
Curdy park maintenance, parks for
city, poles removed from streets,
boulevard lights installed, new. lib
rary, new hospital, street paving,
good roads in county, new armory,
new hotel, commission form of gov
erment, dams in river and banks
beautified new opera house, summer
Chautauqua, winter lecture course,
free choral union concerts, band
supported by city, county fair, new
bridge over river north of city, in
torurban line to Flint, and cement
curbs on all streets.
"Of these desired Improvements
we row have fourteen and the rest
are coming,' declared the secretary
in his characteristically optimistic
manner.
Taking up the industrial propres3
of the city, the speaker declared that
the loss of the Reliance Truck - Co.
employing 120 men had been far
more than offset by the acquisition
of the American Malleables Co., em
ploying 340 men. Extended ap
plause followed when Mr. Seegmll
ler acknowledged the most import
ant part that A. M. Bentley played
in obtaining the new industry for the
city.
Mr. Seegmiller declared that the
Improvement association assumed
obligations of $3,000 in connection
with the new Ann Arbor shops that
the city Is to get, and obligations of
$3200 in the purchase of land for
the Malleables plant. The latter is
paid off, he announced. ' It assumed
and has partially paid something like
$1000 toward the new armory, and
only recently assumed and will soon
pay nearly $3,000 for the furnish
ings of that building. Besides its
members have - contributed nearly
$3,000 toward the proposed new Y.
W. C. A. building.
He ftated that the Owosso Im
provement association was one of a
very few similar organizations in the
United States that meets every week.
Speaking of the Ann Arbor shops
project, ho asserted that the shops
would be built, that the people of
Owosso could rest assured of that.
He declared that whereas 90 per
cent of Owosso's bread supply was
being shipped into
Owo330 three
years ago, not a loaf comes in now.
F ";) v&y
hit iVji i V
i
He emphasized the need of parks,
advocating strongly the purchase of
the Emerson woods, yand the grove
and West Oliver street, on the river
.bank. Applause greeted his recitaL
of his plan for a boulevard and pave
ment that would connect the parks
he proposed to establish. He urged
the necessity of a new hotel here,
and recited an instance of poor hotel
facilities. He uttered a prediction
that a new hotel would be under
construction before the end of 191&
He advocated free band and choral
union concerts, and declared that the
eieciric nne io runt looked like a
certainty at present.
Touching on the subject of the
vacant plant of the Owosso Carriage
and Sleigh Co., the speaker declared
that since it was vacated, 50 propo
sitions for its occupancy had been
considered by the association, and
that four were now under considera
tion. The speaker took a few well aimed
wallops at the man who knocks his
town, and urged constructive criti
cism. His classification of critics with
those afflicted with the hoof and
mouth disease, the blind staggers,
hog cholera and hook worm disease,
was unique and highly illustrative.
He declared that the meanest man in
the world is the man who will not
"get in and help, but will stand off
and criticize those who are working
for the betterment of tlw city." He
related numerous instances of the
good the association has done for
business men in the way of saving
them money.
Mayor DeYoung's Addresp.
Mayor James De Young was the
next speaker. He enumerated the
duties of each of the three commis
sioners and gave a resume of what
had been accomplished by the com
mission since it took office on April
13, 1914. He Btated that the com
mission in those two years, had ex
pended approximately $47,000 for
improvements consisting of new
pavements down town, at a cost of
$10,600, a new water supply costing
$8500. Extension of water mains at
an expense of $12,237, a new coal
shed built at the water works plant,
costing $2150, improvements made
around the library costing ' $1200,
and $4500 paid toward the new ar
mory. In addition the city has
built three miles of sidewalks cost
ing $3000, and bought tools valued
at $2000. The amounts represent
what the city at large paid on the im
provements. The mayor stated that provisions
had been made in the budget, recent
ly adopted, for funds that would cut
the city's bonded indebtedness by
$18,000, or to $227,749. He expressed
satisfaction over the fact that South
Washington street is to be paved this
year and expressed he hope that the
same improvement may be made on-
Corunna avenue next year.
He stated that commission is limit
ed in its resources by the 'stafate en
acted in 1909, which makes it com
pulsory to pay bonds Issued after
that date when they are due, or to
refund bonds in serial form, issued
before the law became effective. The
city has a number of bonds, he de
clared, that under this law, must bo
taken care of when they fall due. He
said that before 1920 there will be
old bonds totalling $85,000 due, and
that before 1924, bonds totalling
$105,000 will mature. All of these,
ho said, must be refunded as serial
bonds, or paid when due.
To offset this legacy of indebted
ness, left it by the old council, the
mayor said however, thPt the com
mission . inherited public property
worth $368,559, exclusive of the
schools, and had also been left by
the council permanent improvements
in the form of pavements sewers and
water mains valued at $354,000, in
addition to sidewalks worth about
$100,000.
Referring to the fate of the fire
department and park bonding ques
tions, at the hands of the people, the
executive said that he felt no particu
lar regret over the defeat of the plan
to motorize the flro department, but
was sorry that the park project met
with disfavor. He expressed the fear
that unless the city acquires the Dira
mlck property now, it will never get
another opportunity to secure it.
"I believe," said Mayor De Young,
"that it was lost through misunder
standing and a lack of harmony.
There are certain elapses in the city
who feel antagonistic to anything the
Improvement association advocates.
This fetling Is deplorable but It ex
ists nevertheless, and must b faced
squarely. It Is this clas3 that we
want to reach and mingle with, to
bring about a better understanding.
"I believe that it would be a good
plan to utilize this building for the
purpose of holding smokers, and get
fngether meetings, where everyone
would be welcome, and where mat
ters of public Interest and import
ance could be talked over. I be
lieve it would create a better feeling.
The commission I venture to say.
