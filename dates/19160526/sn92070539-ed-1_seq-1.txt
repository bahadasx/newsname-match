Construction will bcuin at onco

Soldier Murdered by Woman
Fred Grimes, of Company C!,
20th Infantry, was killed by a
woman in the red light district
Sunday night. The shot was
tired from a revolver, the ball
taking elTcCt in the right should
er, passing into the lungs and
into tilt; luart, death resulting
instantly. The woman was taken
to Deming Tuesday afternoon to
await the action of the grand
jury.
A. .1. Evans, the local agent for
the Ford, sold a aar last week to
15. O. Johnson, proprietor of the
pool hall in the old Moody build
ing.
W. 1. llobbs, of the Sunnyside
district, made a business trip to
El Paso Tuesday, returning
home Wednesday.
proceeded at once to close up
every club in town.
The names of the clubs affect
ed by tills order were the Hen-
cvolent Order of I lees, The
Loyal Ordor'of Moose, Fraternal
Order of Grizzly Hears, Camp
Furlong Social Club, Punitive
Expedition Social Club, X. C. O.
Social Club, Frontier Social
Club, and San Juan Social Club.
Two or three other clubs were
being organized at the time the
order wont Into effect.
One of these cMibs I mil been
in operation for more than two
years und in all possibilities this
club would have been allowed
the privilege of selling its mem
bers booze hud not the matter
been over done. Xo one club
would sell a man booze enough to
intoxicate him, but when a man
belonged to three or lour of the
organizations and tried to make
each one in a single night he was
very apt to get loaded before lie
got to the last one. Taking all
circumstances into consideration
the people generally are in sym
pat by witli the trustees in clos
Ing ttie lid on the booze propo
sitlon.
Of course there is the boot
legging problem, but Jack
Thomas, chief of inilice, Sheriff
Simpson, and other oflicors
think that witli the large number
of men on duty here at alt times
this can be reduced to a mini
mum, if not completely wiped
out.

Columbus As It Is
Xearly every newspaper in the
State of New Mexico has a rep
resentative in Columbus as a
member of the militia. Of course
they all send letters to thoir,
papers slid many of litem am
very interesting. An urtiolo in
the New Mexican by Captain
Sellgmiin, who is in command
of the company from Santa
Fe, headed "Columbus As It
Is," says,
"The town is a typical frontier
town, reminding you of the kind
you see in the movies. Deputy
sheriffs with their guns strupped
to their hips: soldiers in uniform
at every turn: motor trucks
wheezing os they pass in and
out daily newspaiier corrosoii-
dents and moving picture men
in riding breeches and outing
coats: vaudeville and picture
shows that is the place. Hut,
unlike the western town of the
movies, there is no saloons!"
We Sure Have, Bill
W. E. Holt, who Is now editor
of the Deming Graphic in the
absence Clyde Earl Ely, a lieut
enaut in the New Mexl :o militia,
in an article published last week
guys in part:
"Company 1 hurried to the aid
of the stricken citizens of Coluin
bus on the fatal morning of
March 0th, aim for that reason
Columbus has a tender sixil in
its heart for the boys."
You are right Brother Holt,
and if thu opportunity uver pre '
sents itself Columbus will reci
procato.
Test Well Down 100 Feet
The deep well being drilled
on the Anderson place sontheaMt
of town by E. C. Kniflin lias been
put down UK) feet. The work
has not been rushed on account
of some equipment for the well
rig which was ordered miiiiu
time igo having not yet shown
up. This stuff is expected
every day and as soon as it ar
rives the drilling will proceed
rapidly.
Business Men, Attention
Tuesday, May JiOth, having
been designated as Decoration
Day, and as preparations are be
ing made to observe the occasion
witli an appropriate program, 1
resiK'ctfully request all places
of business in tho Village of
Columbus to close at least dur
ing tho sorvices. The hour for
holding tills service will be an
nounced by the pa9tor of the
M. B. Church and 1 think that
we should show our resects by
closing our business houses for
this short period.

Church Notes
The women of the Holy Trin
ty Mission have formed t Guild
for mutual work i.i imvancing
the building fund oy which it is
hoped soon to put up a Parish
House for the use of this newest
Columbus Parish
It is said in some directions
that the one church .where all
Christians arc welcomed at. all
services, should be enough for
the town- but there is a future
to be consideiid, and the up to
dale residents believe the best
time to build for the future is
right now To express the situa
tion With more viuor than elu
gaucc, "the bnstwuy to keep up
with the procession, is to tide
In the van."
When Ut. Rov. F. It. Uowden,
Hishopofthu P. E. See of the
State conies for a series of ser
vices May SJlst, and June 1st ii
is planned that thu tirst service
which will be in the evening of
May iJlst being Wednesday next,
by the kindness of the chaplains
of the U. S. Army the 'tirst ser
vice wllL foe held in the church
tent below headquarters. This
servico is for eiviliunsras well as
the soldiers, and will include the
rites, Christening and Contir
malion If there are any can
didated for tills important part
of tho Episcopal faith. One ot
the bands will give the church
uiusio, unci it is probable that
Chaplain Vincc it from Silver
City stationed hero witli the Na
tional Guard, will bring a quart
ette of the Guard to help with
tho vocal music. Tim hour cau
not be determined at present,
for this service but will bo post
ed in convenient places, before
thu arrival of the bishop, who
will come so far for this service,
it is hoped there will be a large
attendance.
Among the officers elected at
the meeting held with Mrs. J
Anderson of the newly organ
ized Guild of Holy Trinity Mis
slon for the coming six months,
were Mrs. J. Anderson, Presi
dent, Mrs. George Peters; vice
president, and Mrs. Nelson,
Secretary and Treasurer. The
luttor ofiiccs will be divided
after the ensuing six months,
us it is hoped the Guild member
ship will increase so much by
that time that one member will
tind it impossible to uttend to
the doublo duties.
The Rev. C. H. Hoddington
presided over thu elections
which were unanimously car
ried. The lawn social given by the
Ladies' Guild of the Holy Trin
ity Mission a. Mrs. George
Peters' home for the benefit ol
tho building fund of the pro
posed Episcopal Parish House
was a great success notwlth
standing the fact that the failure
of tho electric lights on Thurs
day night and the lack of moon
prevented many Columbus peo
pie from going tho distance to
tho attractive home of ono of the
fow fortunate families who boast
a lawn in tills part of the coun
try.
Thu members of the Ladles
Aid and the W. C. T. Union, and
many of the other residents of
Columbus gave substantial aid
in this affuir and contributed
much to the success by which
$20 will bo added to the fund,
which it is hoped will be when
augumentod by the bishops
promised donations of $50 sutil-
clent to start building on tho
lots owned by the parish, almost
immediately.
There is somo talk of the mem
bers of tho various societies In
Columbus who work so harmoiii.

been arranged for Memorial Day,

Great Activity in Building
More buildings are under
course of construction now than
has uver been in Columbus at
one time. There is at present
three or four restaurants, a tirst
class grocery, a good sized busi
ness house on main street, a
real estuto office, and many other
business houses, in addition to
a large number of dwellings be
ing built. Construction work is
soon to start on many other bus
iness houses, and from the
present outlook Columbus is
soon to bo a real city.
Columbus School Closes Term
The Columbus school closed
Friday, there being no com
mencement exercises on account
of tho small titter danee in the
eighth grade due to thu raid.
Lingurn Hurkhead deserves
secial credit fur Having continu
ed in school and having passed
the examination for county dip
loma. Tills diploma entitles him
to enter any high school in the
state.
It is interesting to look back
and review the progress made in
the last nine months. School
opened with an enrollment of 85
with four teachers. After the
holidays the enrollment in
creased to sucli u number that
another teacher was found nec
essary. Uy a rigid enforcement
of the compulsory law the eh
rollment readied a maximum
of 178, or more than 100 per
cent increase.
Today's work concludes my
connection with the Columbus
schools. I voice the sentiment
of the entire teaching forco in
saying that I fully appreciate
every evidence of kindly interest
that has been shown in welfare
of tho schools. With best wishes
for an increased educational
spirit: and for a protitable and
successful school term next
year. It. E. Stivison.
Miss Grace G. Goobel, ac
companied by Mrs. William
Gaines and two children, and
Miss Itcbekah Cotfin, nfllondale,
were visitors to Columbus Tues
day afternoon.
Mrs. J. I j. Walker Is in El
Paso this week for a week's visit
with friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Stivison left
hero Friday for Wellington,
Kansas.
ously together, forming a Wom
an's Civic League, for the bet
terment of the town-fun there
are many things women can do
to help In civic l-ottermont, as is
proven by their success in such
movements in the big eitle's of
the East.
Commercial Hotel
Will Be Rebuilt
Will Be Pressed Brick and
Modern in Every Respect
Work Will be Rushed
Construction started Friday
morning on a modern und up to
date liotol at the place where the
old Commercial was destroyed
by tiro in t lie raid. The dimen
sions of the new building is
"() x W) feet, two stories witli u
basement, and will be built with
pressed brick.
It is to be a tirst class hostelry
witti all modern conveniences,
steam heat, baths, etc., and will
cost about $15,000, The location
near the duoi is ull that could
be desired und there is no ques
tion but that it will be a good
investment for the owner.
Sam Havel is building the
hotel and Is to' be complemented
in giving tiie town this class of
a building. Ho owned the hotel
that was destroyed by tho band
its and his loss was not less
than $25,000 and was not able to
collect one cent of thu insurance.
G. Crisamoro has the contract
and will complete the building
just as soon as possible. He
thinks that if no delay is en
countered in securing thu mater
ial lie we will have it ready for
occupancy within sixty days.
That, section Of the town was
completely wiped out by the Are,
but it is rapidly being rebuilt,
and will soon have a bettor ap-
lieurance than ever. A barber
shop was hauled down from
Deming last week and set in
iwsitlon near the new hotel.

tertained Wednesday evening in
honor of their daughter, Miss
Mary Field, who will leave early
next week for an extended visit

CONTAINS MAP OF
AREA AROUND COLUMBUS
Special interest attaches to a re
port just Issued by the United
States Geological Survey by rea
son of tho accompanying detailed
map of Luna County, New Mexico,
which shows accurately the town
of Columbus, and all the surround
ing ranches, the town of Demimr
to the north, as well as the moun
tains and other natural features
and the railroads of the area. Tho
report is descriptive of the geo
logy and particularly the under
ground water resources of the
largo valley in which Columbus
and Deming He. Tho report has
special reference to the hundreds
of wells in the valley, the water
of which is used for Irrigation. The
depths of tho wells are shown, and
areas .and approximate depths at
which tho drill will probably strike
water.
