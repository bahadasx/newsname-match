2 NEW YORK
LETTER
Editor Independent:
This monster New York to growing
like a snowball that is rolling down
hill; it is a magnet that attracts
human elements from every cranny
of the ; globe. -This morning I' saw
women from Albania and Servia car
rying casks of fruit oa their heads;
heard Italians and Syrians chattering
at their little huckster stands; talked
with Germans from Berlin (who think
that no country but theirs can possi
bly be in the right); chatted with i
Greek fruit dealer; may eat my even
lug meal at a Spanish restaurant
where I will meet and speak with na
tives of Andalusia, Barcelona, Madrid
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines;
there are sections big enough to make
,. an ordinary city, each crowded to eu
location with outlandish, ill-fed, ill-
smelling foreigners. From the Brook
lyn Bridge entrance, down Park Row,
that great, silent Btream Of humanity
is Rowing, all southward Jn the morn
ing; all northward in. the evening,
Since I camo here eight months ago,
. aiore people have passed Frankfort
street than .there are souls in the
whole country. On one day last fall
the police counted 296,20 J persons
that passed that corner in daylight
hours, and there were 7,000 vehicles
besides. But the vehie'es on Fifth
avenue are simpiy amazing, i re
cently rode down that avenue from
Fifty-fifth street to Park Row, in a
taxi-cab, and it was like a - river of
taxi-cabs, in the stream of which we
could only float as fast as the Stream
would allow. When J went to cross
the avenue on' foot at Fifty-fifth
street, I had to ; wait my chance to
dash In among the. flood of automo
biles, taxis, motor-cycles, as well as
occasional horse ' carriages. Just
escaping from the wheels of a mon
ster touring car driven by the be
spangled chauffeur ef one of the "Van
Astorbilts", ran right in front of an
other honking engine of destruction,
jumping to the left in the nick of
.time, only to be brushed by a ' motor
cycle going-like lighning the other
' way, and just as I began to breathe a
sigh of relief, another auto tooting a
horn that sounded like the crack of
doom, bore down . on me- from 'the
other direction, and as f arias I ccnld
see in any direction, there were those
autos,' their, honking horns making
one tremendous blast, while the air
was full of petrol smell and fine street
dust. No wonder there is an aver
age of one death a day .from these
vehicles. I somehow crossed the
street, and a blue-coat ,pn the other
side said.it was not a busy day; I
ought to sea it on one of the big hol
idays! . I want to be somewhere else
, then. '
Why are all these people coming to
New York? The city is too big bow,
Extending subways build out into, the
suburbs, which in turn build np In big
apartment houses, which soon fill up,'!
and that brings more subways and
elevated railroads. Only for va, - tery
few are the big rewards in city ' life;
millions must sink In misery. There is
. not one chance in a thousand for a
country boy to succeed here. ' Even
if he should get money ' (New York's
religion) ha will lose the capacity, to
enjoy it, which means that -ha has
gained nothing And he will lose
that precious jewel of sincerity, and
truth perhaps; aH New York is not
bad, bat the tendency is that way.and
human weakness is more common than
' is strength of character. ' ,
It is a common thing for a young
man or woman to come here with
bright hopes, clean . character ' and
good health, with a modest portion of
money; and within a year or two lose
evervthinur worth living for. Fifteen
thousand whisky saloons beckon to
them, and the darker damnation , of
immorality lurks for them on a thous
and streets. God and the Great Ad
versary of man know what becomes
of them Those., who . have grabbed
their pitifaj UiUa. earnings of patri-
nonv. and i ruined them, body aai
soul, care no more for them than they
do for the orange peel they have
thrown in the gutter. Those glitter
ing lighta and revolving electric signs
Proa.il war, 'The Qresl WMi
Way, The Street of the , Midnight
Sun," chine no more for those poor
victims; they simply drop out, and
are known no more. It is estimated
that' one hundred thousand, young
women are attracted to New . York
each year, from the smaller towns
and country districts. There is not
honest work for all of them. Three
fourths of them ' had better stayed
away, or died in their cradles. 0, yes,
there is Mary Pickford, moving pic
ture actress, whose income is $4,000
a week, (and she can't properly use
one-fourth of it); and tyiere is Char
lie Chaplin, called "the king of the
movie comedians," who the other day
signed np a contract for a salary of
$670,000 a year, or nearly $4 for
e?ery working. minute of every day
(and he can't properly use ten cents
on the dollar) "just to make a dog-
goned fool of himself," as somebody
said of him. 0, yes,, New York has
the money, and if yog can amuse it,
you will get rich. But think of the
millions of boys and girls who have no
genius, but who might have lived and
died happy jn their country homes
but for tbia grinning Moloch that
swallowed them and their little all.
I heard a powerful sermon the oth
er night at Uie bt. JNIicholas avenue
Presbyterian church. The minister,
Dr. Brown, told of a family who , had
come from the country to New York
City, to seek wealth and ' happiness,
Among their possessions was one of
those big Family Bibles which in the
old country home in Ohio used to hold
the place of honor on the center ta
ble . Between the old and the New
Testament was the record, telling of
the births, deaths and marriages in
the famjly. In the narrow rooms of
Ltbeir little apartment, away op in a
big stone building, there was no room
for the big old Book; they had ceased
to read it anyway, and its teachings
were so out of tune with this city's
ways that it was positively ridiculous.
The old religion, the faith of their
parents and of their country neigh
bors, was first tiresome, then foolish,
then unendurable. They moved from
one apartment to another, as the
janitor or the other cooped-op in
mates became uncongenial, and final
ly, one morning, the garbage man
found that old family Bible in the
ash-can, ready to be carted away to
the dump. What had that family
gained by coming here?
It is no wonder that a millionaire
business man of this city, who. came
here from the country to make his
riches, full of bitter feeling about
city life, even where he had made his
wealth, gave vent to the following
terrible words, which were given me
by a friend of the man who' wrote
them, and which have become famous,
although the author remains unknown:
"Vulgar of manner, overfed,
Overdressed and' underbred. V
Heartleaa, Godless, Well's delight,
Bude by day and lewd tyv algfat;
Dwarfed the man and large the brute,
Ruled by Jew and prostitute;
Purple-robed and pauper-clad;
Rotten, raving, money-mad '
A squirming horde in money' mesh
-.A wilderness of human neshv '
Crazed by avarice, lust and rum
New York, thy name's delirium!"
No one who has ever looked as I
have upon the yelling hordes in the
Stock Exchange and heard .the din
and seen the "squirming of the mob
of money-mad" creatures, the ticker
tapes ia long white threads filling the
air'like spider-webs, can say that the
above picture of avarice is over
drawn, except that it does not pre-
tend to give the bright side of New
York, -which ia here too. for those
who seek it. This city is a ladder as
well as a pit, but the seekers of the
pit are in the majority, and it is so
much easier to fall than to climb.
Why not stay in your sweet country
home, where you do not have so far
to fall. He who sticks near to moth
er earth cannot fall very hard.
A bright, really bright, boy wrote
me from McNairy county some time
ago, asking whether I could find a
place for him heref. He has ideas be
yond the raising of corn or cotton,
and had a writing style of no mean
ability, in writing that letter. I
would like to see him, but I do not
want him to bring his youth, his mind
and his heart to this hard market.
If he just has to leave McNairy (and
I would be sorry for it if be did, for
the county Deeds more like him) let
biro begin bli career cesrer bone, and
then, when he is ', ripe enough for
New York, let him come but pot for
years yet. ,
worse than low prices lor crops,
droughts, floods or insect pests, is the
picking up and leaving of the brawn
and sinew, the best men and tfomen
from a country community. There
are lots of well-tcdo people ' in and
around beimer, ; Look at toe Adams,
Alexander, ' Abernathy, (all the A's
this-time, but there are others) and
other' families, who have stuck to
their home town and prospered. They
have more money than thousands of
just as smart people who came here
to get rich, and what is far better,
they know what to do with it. Clem
Lea might have had a Fifth avenue
mansion, a half-dozen autos, a French
chauffeur and an oiBce on Wall street
with millions in the City . National
Bank if he had come here forty years
ago; but Clem knows what is good
for him, and is wise in sticking to
the good old soil of McNairy, where
his smiling fields and his grunting
herds of Berkshire pigs are a source
of real pleasure to him an example
to his neighbors and an actual unit in
the nation s Wealth and strength.
P. H. Thrasher might have been hailed
as Colonel", and sat on the board of
aldermen, and helped show up graft;
ye editor might have presided over
the destinies of the hourly "Pink
Screamer", but he prefers to shed
gentle joy each week . to his . old
neighbors and friends by disseminata
ing the local news and giving me room
to spread myself at will in these long'
winded articles from the great, wick
ed, splendid city; and our' friend
Thrasher is happier and better off in
McNairy, where his sterling example
will have perhaps eveju a more lasting
effect, and where he is not bothered
with rotten Tammany politics. -
I wrote the young man something
like this: The great electric lights
on Broadway attract' multitudes of
insects, which fall dead at the foot of
the dazzling glow. New York wants
you for what you can give it; but
cares nothing else about you. Stay
where you are now happy and secure;
marry one whom you have long known,
and safe in the love of one good worn
an (one is a plenty), "rejoice with the
wife of thy youth", and train up your
children as you were trained, to love
God and your neighbor.' Help build
up your home county and town; they
need you; New York does not. Above
all, keep the dew of youth . in your
heart. God pity the McNairy boy
who is not thrilled when the young
leaves come out in the tree tops, when
the birds sing, and the little rills go
curling their prattling waters toward
the creeks, and the may-apples begin
to spread their little green tents in
the bottoms, and the red-buds light
their cool torches on the hills; who
does not love the smell of the. soil as
it turns before the plow-share with a
homely perfume that is more precious
in its promise of fruitage than a whole
perfume factory here; who does not
yearn at the close of an earnest day's
work for a plunge in the creek under
the hazel, and alder , bushes, and in
whose heart there is not thankfulness
that he can rise with the sun in the
morning and plow, hoe and harvest
for his own meat and bread. And
sweeter that meat and that bread (to
say nothing of that golden butter,
creamy clabber and all sorts of good
things from the garden) that is pre
pared and set befJre him by loving
hands, than all the foreign delicacies
that will be served tip to-nieht at
Rector's and Delmonico's in this place
of jaded appetites and , broken con
science by waiters from France and
Greece. '
It is no exaggeration to say that
year in and year out. the average
farmer in McNairv will nave
more actual wealth than the same
man or woman in this citv.
Yesterday I saw thousands of store
clerks going home, on Thirtv-Third
street. Their pale faces and abstract
ed looks did not tell of haDDiness.
health or contentment. As I looked
at them, I thought of my mother's
favorite quotation about '
'The dwarfing city's pale abortion".
All' McNairy needs now is more
people to stick te its opportunities
and improve them to the utmost with
modern method? of farming and mar
keting. Above all, boys, stick to your
home I would bava been happier
Ki richer it I could bara 4on so,
So my young friend writes me from
Selraer: "Tennessee, I hear ym call
ing me." ' " ' ,

By 6:45 a.m. Sunday inornmg we

motley looking bunch. There was
"Sporty" Perkins all dressed up as if
he were going to see his best girl and
were traveling De Luxe Style, instead
of riding incognito on a wagon bound
for the bottoms. The cook said his
costume was only twelve hours from
Fifth avenue, Never having been to
Fifth Avenue, I suppose the cook was
right. And there was "Purty" Gooch,
"the best looking guy . in the camp"
and a real lady-like old gentleman he
was. Riding the seat with 'myself
was, that wonderful " expounding kid,
James fenimore Amnions. His cos
tume made him show up a second
Villa. . Really, all that he lacked re
sembling Villa, was mustache. " The
cook and the Plumber looked as if
they were going ditching. I was
about to leave out the owner and
driver of our "schooner", : He still
wore his wedding-suit, and all the
way talked about getting back to his
"dear little wife', before dark, If
James F. hadn't resembled Villa so
much, I would say that we' were an
other punitive expedition in search of
Villa. . !

AlBERT GLLESPIE, Agin! ' - , SsIniM, f inn.
'Squire Wesson tned to have us ar
rested for going fishing on Sunday.
Between home and cur camping
place we devoured twenty ham sand
wiches, fivejarge onions, fifteen hard
boiled eggs, and about twenty peanut
butter and pimento sandwiches. ,
' We arrived at "Camp Fun" about
2:30 In the" afternoon and pitched
our tents. After getting our tents up
we then put everything in "camp
shape." My! but fish sure wiB bite
some on Sunday. (?) The rest of the
afternoon we spent in reading and
cracking Sunday School (?) jokes.
Villa (James F.) said he was "delight
ed, with the surroundings" and we all
hollered "amen, amen". We were all
glad to get away from town and
hoped we wouldn't see a single per
son the whole time we stayed. ' But
we hadn't been there long until a
native of the bottoms dripped in and
told us of a certain wild man, which
in his haunts had been seen bathing
in a pool, of water near our 'camp.
This didn't sound good to the Plumber
and I don't think any of the rest con
sidered it good news. We , turned
into our pallets about nine. I didn't
sleep,any for thinking about the wild
man. The other boys said they
couldn't sleep any for the mosquitoes.
but I know what was the reason; they
too, were thinking about .the wild
wild man. I always slept between
rine ana snot gun. Believe me, we
had enough artillery to whip out i
regiment of wild men.
Monday we hunted and fished al
nay, aespice tne rain. Tuesday we
caught a nice eight pound cat and
some smaller ones. Every fourth
hour we went swimming. At night
we sat around the camp fire and told
lies, jokes, etc. .
ine rains causea tne river to rise
a little Tuesday night we caught
about twenty-five pounds of fish.
Sunday night a fox attempted
raid on our storage tent, but the raid
was frustrated by us opening fire
with our artillery. Really, we thought
it was the wild man paying us a visit.
After we shot a .round or two, and
after Mr, Reynard had retreated,
"Purty" Gooch, who had slept through
it all, awoke, stood up, flourishing his
young capnon and very excitedly said,
Where is he? Where is he? Give
me a shot at him!" Gooch said he
thought the wild man was upon us.
Sporty" Perkins and "Villa" Am.
mons certainly have had very adven
turous lives, from the wonderful tales
they tell, and they can tell one right
after another, too. They are a Cap.
tain Kidd and a Black Beard if all
of their exploits are true. Talk about
a good cook! we had one. We had
mulligan stew, fish broiled over the
hot coals and fried in the pan, chipped
potatoes fried brown corn fried dry,
bacon fried to a crisp,' oyster soup,
salmon croquets, etc. Really,! our
menu would make Lindsay Perkins
desert New York city. "Villa" Am-
' i i
mons certainly am nave a ravenous
appetite. He ate ten big pieces of
fish and didn't even "croak". '
We , embarked for home - with
twenty-five pounds of fish tied on be
hind our "schooner" The first fel-
ow we met on reaching town wanted
10 unow now mucn we paia lor our
fish. ' : ' ;
; Oh,' yes, I was about to forget some
thing. "Sporty" Perkins got . the
hatchet mixed up with the scout ax,
and it , required the assistance of
(newly-married) Stiles to untangle
the matter. . ' '-''J '..
