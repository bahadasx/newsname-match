You Needn't Be a Millionaire
Dressing well doesn't necesarily
imply spending more than you can
afford.
Of course you can pay a lot for
dothes if you want to, but why
pay for more value than you actu
ally get ?
We've always made ' it a point
to put in the things that are highest
in quality and most reasonable in
price.
In men's clothes, for example.
What better ean be had than Cloth
craft at $io to $20?
It's the same all the way down
the line. Shirts, hats, socks, col
lars, underwear, every thing you
buy here is bound to please be
cause you feel that it is worth every
cent you pay for it.
Our new Spring styles are awai1
itig your approval.
