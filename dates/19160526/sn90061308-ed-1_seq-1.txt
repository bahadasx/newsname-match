DISMISS CHARGE
AGAINST CRAIG
Prosecutor Agrees to Action When
Case Is Called Fifth Time
Joplin, May 25. -A charge of mur
der against William Craig, who was
arrested April 2 at his home in Spur
geon on a warrant charging him with
killing Frederick Frazier, a former
mining partner of Craig, was dismiss
ed Tuesday by Justice Roy Moore at
Neosho. '
Justice Moore dismissed the case
with the consent of Thomas Saxton,
prosecuting attorney of Newton coun
ty, who declared that the evidence
against Craig is insufficient to warrant
holding him for trial in circuit court.
Since Craig was arrested his pre
liminary hearing has been postponed
four times on application of Mr. Sax
ton and his assistants to allow more
time for a search of a tailing' pile at
the Tiger mine, of which Frazier was
part owner, for his body. The Anti
Horse Thief Association financed the
search, which lasted more than a
month, but took no part in the prose
cution of Craig.

law violations in that locality. While
the animals were slain primarily for
their teeth, the game warden said
that yearlings which are toothless also
were wantonly shot, their carcasses
lying in heaps.

duct of the trial, and by the governor's
reprieve the execution was set for

The seven men were tried in the
district court here and convicted of
first degree murder for their part in
the raid on Columbus, N. M., March
9, in which seventeen soldiers and civ
ilian Americans were killed, several
wounded and a number of buildings
destroyed. Three months later they
were to pay the extreme penalty.
The condemned are: Jose Rangel,
Juan Sanchez, Euseblo Renteria, Tau
rino Garcia, Jose Rodriguez, Francis
co Alvarez and Juan Castillo.
At the trial counsel contended that
the defendants had no knowledge of
where they were going at the time of
the raid and that they were forced to
follow Villa under penalty of death.
Jose Rangel, who was wounded and
carried into Court April 24, when sen
tence was imposed, made a plea for
mercy from his cot. The prisoners
have been in the state penitentiary at
Santa Fe for safe keeping.

PEACE IMPOSSIBLE
NOW, GRAY ASSERTS
British Foreign Secretary Is Unable
to See Any Change in Position
of Allies
London May 24. In an impromptu
speech in the house of commons ' to
night on the question of peace and the
propriety of "employing the Ameri
can press as a platform," subjects un
expectedly raised by Arthur Posonby,
liberal member for Stirling, Scotland,
in a strong address attacking the gov
ernment for allowing diplomatic eti
quette to stand in the way of possible
peace pour parleurs, Sir Edward Grey,
the British foreign secretary, set
aside all ideas that peace negotiations
were possible at the present stage, and
plainly reiterated that the position of
the wires was in no way changed.
Sir Edward declared it was impos
sible to consider terms of peace with
out a prev 'ous agreement between the
entente allies. Further, he expressed
the decided opinion that the hostilities
had not yet reached a stage where it
was possible to talk of peace, especial
ly as the German public was constant
ly being "fed with lies" by their min
isters. STRAWBERRY SHIPMENTS
The Ozark Fruit Growers Associa
tion report the shipment of 50 cars of
strawberries from this district, Wed
nesday. From the Monett office the ship
ments were as follows: Monett, 2;
Butterfield, 5; Republic, 3; Peirce City,
3; Logan, 1; Sarcoxie, 2; Marionville,
1; Carthage, 1; Garfield, 1 and Avoca,
1. ' From the Neosho and Decatur
districts they shipped 30 car loads.
Up tb this time this Association has
sold (132 car loads from the Monett
office. - '
The Monett Berry Growers' Union
shipped out 12 carloads, Wednesday
night. They shipped 5 from Monett;
2 from Wheaton; 3 from Purdy and 2
from Verona. ,
The prices are lower than at the be
ginning owing to over-production . The
Tennessee berries and the Arkansas
and Virginia berries are still on the
market and it is estimated that 400
carloads were shipped in the- United
States yesterday.
The Missouri berries grade higher
than from the other states but the
quantity on the market gives the buy
ers an excuse for offering lower prices
even though the Missouri berries are
far superior to any others.

This news reached Cassville Sunday
morning when cards giving the sad
news were received from Barney Bush

been visiting at Hugo. The particu
lars were not given and as Mr. and
Mrs. Bush have not yet returned

Dodd,. engaged in the mercantile busi
ness at Monett in the early nineties.
Later they moved their large stock of
goods to Cassville where for a time
they had an immense business for a
town of this size. In addition to the
mercantile business the two brothers
engaged in the nursery business on a
large scale, operating principally in
Oklahoma. J. B. Dodd built the ele
gant home now owned by Jas. P.
Turner on the east side of Flat creek,
from town. They remained in Cass
ville until about 1902 or 1903 when
G. W., known generally as Walter,
moved to Oklahoma and J. B. and
family moved to Fulton, Ky. Walter
lived for a while at Grant and later
built a fine home and moved to Hugo
where he had since lived. He had been
verv successful in his business enter
prises and is thought to have been
worth possibly two hundred thousand
dollars or more.
While living in Cassville Walter
married a St. Louis girl. They re
mained in Cassville only a short time
after his marriage but the citizens
here who were well acquainted with
Mrs. Dodd say that she was a lady of
unusual culture and a most pleasant
woman. Cassville Republican.

SALZER BROTHERS
T HAVE MORE
BERRY PICKERS
Monett People Urged to Send Children
to Strawberry Patches to Save
the Immense Crop.
Monett's great strawberry crop will
not be harvested unless more persons
go to the berry patches. The unus
ually heavy yield has made it neces
sary to have more pickers than usual.
The -berry growers will convey the
pickers to and from the patches. This
year they are paying 2 cents a quart
to get the berries picked.
Children are now out of school and
parents are urged to send them to the
berry patches to help out the growers.
A child can make good wages, and the
work is healthful and pleasant.
