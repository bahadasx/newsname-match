we may have many more just like it.
It would not be quite fair not to com

were on duty and who did their share
in o-operation with the many others
toward making the day a success.

Wauaon Knight of Pythias, Wednes
day, the date of the Pythian County
Convention and Review. The clans
began to gather in the forenoon and
they found a town beautifully deco
rated in honor of their coming and a
hearty welcome for each and every !
one who came. The town Slogan, I
"This is Your Town" was exemplified
by the welcome accorded the visitors
and the hospitality with which they
were entertained.
Wauseon never beforV looked so
beautiful; the business places seemed
to vie with each other to see which
one could make the most artistic dis
play of the Pythian Colors. The
committee in charge of preparations
and arrangements had done' their
work thoroughly and well and the re
sult was that all visitors were1 taken
car of in such a way that they had
no reason to regret ceding and many
reason to be glad that they cmae.
The-: jtythian Sisters took charge of
the" Commissary Department and
even hundred and twenty-five were
served a delicious supper, in such a
systematic manner that many were
the compliments paid them.
" But it Was not all a on sided affair.
The visitors, and there were about
one thousand of them, contributed
their full share to great success
which the event registered. ' Knights
ffom Bowling- Green, Liberty Center
and Weston, Ohio, from Indiana and
Southern Michigan and the brigade
' of D. O. K. K. and their drum and
bugle corps from Toledo, not to men
tion the many from the lodges with
in the county, swelled the number
'until Wauseon's visitor for the day
and evening nearly touched the 1000
mark. Swanton Lodge alone was re
presented by seventy-five m(nbers
many of whom were also members of
the Swanton Cornet Band which fur
, nished excellent music during the af
ternoon and evening.
. First rank work was exemplified by
the Wauseon Team at one o'clock
this was followed by a stirring ad
drest from William Beatty, Grand
Keeper of Records and Seals of the
Domain of Ohio, that made every Py
thian Knight proud of his order and
inspired him to be true to its teach
ings. Swanton and Delta Lodges in
a combination team impressed the
teaching of the second rank upon a
large class of candidate in a manner
that many of the visiting KnightJ said
was the best they had ever witness
ed. Mr. Thompson, business manager
of the Ohio Pythian followed with
an lfre that again - stirred the
loyalty of the members of the order
Kb inspired to a better exemplifi
cation of it principles tt their daily
live.
From five to aeven supper was
tewed In the Castla Hall by the Py
thian Sister and a 'vaudeville enter
tainment was given in the Princess
Theatre at the same time so there was
no time hanging heavy on anyone's
hands. '
Promptly at eight o'clock the for
tnation of the monster Pythian Pa
rade was made on Fulton street and
one of the most beautiful pageants
, that Wauseon baa ever witnessed
moved through the streets to finish in
front of the Pythian Building where
the D. O. K. K. and the First Rank
Team of Lodge Number 20 of Toledo,
gave their splendid drill. We shall
not attempt to describe these drills,
they seemed to the average man per-
zect in every detail.
At 9:16 p. m. Grand Chancellor
Commander William Schuchardt of
Cincinnati gave an address in the
Princess which was at once patriotic,
instructive, eloquent and intensely in
teresting. Mr. Schuchardt said in
the course of his remarks that this
was the largest and best county con
vention of Pythiana that it had been
his privilege to attend since he had
served as chief executive of the Or
der in Ohio. The - Bowling Green
third rank team conferred the rank
of Knight on a class vf fourteen and
their work was splendid. The dig
nity and lmpressiveness with which
these brothers taught the lesson of
true Knighthood can never be forgot
' ten by those who listened a;.d watch
ed. The grand finale of the day was
reached at a late hour when the Blue
Yellow and Red Drill Team of
Bowling Green Lodge No. 158 put on
their beautiful and spectacular drill
on the fevement h front of the Py
thian Building. Jt was a "great day"
"As You Like It" the class play of
the Class of 1916 was given in Saun
ders' Hall last Tuesday evening. In
spite of the fact that the play was
given by the class under rather dis
advantageous circumstances it was
very creditably presented and the
members of the class deserve high
praise for their splendid work as do
those who trained them. The play
was to have been given in North Park
but weather conditions prevented.
Having been drilled with the out
of doors performance in view and as
the necessity of change to under cover
did not appear until Monday, the class
were working under difficulties when
the play was staged in Saunder's
Hall Tuesday evening but in spite of
all this and the fact that there was
no platform in the hall the characters
were well interpreted and most mem
bers of the class seemed letter per
fect in their parts." Following is the
cast of characters: '

BACCflLAUHEftTE
Senior Class of Wauseon High School
Listen to An Appropriate and In
teresting Sermon from Rev. J. A.
Wharton at The Methodist Church
Sunday Evening.
Long before seven-thirty Sunday
evening the large auditorium of the
Methodist church was filled with citi
zens of Wauseon who had come to
listen to the Class Sermon to the
Wauseon High School Class of 1916.
Seats for the class and faculty of the
High School were reserved in the
front and center of the auditorium
and a large cluster of Calla' Lillies
formed the most noticeable feature of
the decorations on the platform, the
pastors of the churches of the village
participated in the opening and clos
ing services, the choir of the Metho
dist church led in the congregational
singing and sang a beautiful and ap
propriate anthem.
Rev. Wharton's sermon was mark
ed by its clearness and was forcibly
delivered; his theme was "The Suc
cessful Life" and it was indeed very
timely and appropriate. We take
pleasure in publishing herewith the
entire sermon:
Acts 9:6 Lord, ,what wilt thou
have me do? Phil. 3:13-14 This one
thing I do. I press toward the mark
for the prize.
Phil. 4:131 can do all things
through Christ who strengtheneth me.
These expressions are from the lips
of the same man. They were spoken
at different periods in his career and
each shows the trend of his life in its
respective period. When he said,
"Lord, what wilt thou have me do?"
Saul ofTarus was seeking the best
purpose "in life. He had not found it
before. Led by his own will, burning
with a zeal that -was not according to
knowledge he was out of the way of
life himself and persecuting unto pris
on and death all who walked therein.
When he said, "This one thing I do,"
he had caught a vision of life's' mean
ing. On the plain near Damascus he
had seen the Great Teacher and the
life that was "hid with Christ in God"
henceforth became the mark toward
which hejn-essed pressed with such
energy and singleness of 'purpose as
to truly say "the things behind I for
get and this one thing I do," As life
went on shaped by this vision he grew
in grace and knowledge to that
strength in which he could say in hu
mility and yet in triumph. "I can do
all things through Christ." Through
these ' sayings we can see the stages
of development in his life a seeker,
a worker, a victor. We can discern
in them his purpose, concentration
of energy and his accomplishment,
The "all things" that he could do
were but the result of the "one
thing" done as the Lord had told him.
The latter part of Paul's life was
crowned with success because it was
a spirit filled. God directed life.
It is evident from this example as
it is from many others in the world's
history that one who expects to be
glorified by success cannot live a ran
dom life. .
Success Demands a Purpose.
When Paul said: "I press toward
the mark," it was but another way
of saying he had an aim in life. An
aim is needed in every life to keep it
from failure. Many have failed be
cause they had no purpose or the
wrong one. Some have ended nowhere
because they traveled the path of
don't care. Others have taken- the
road of "By and By" and according
to the Spanish proverb it led to Never.
Many have made a grand success of
hitting nothing because that was the
mark at which they aimed. Without a
purpose in life a twofold failure stares
one in the face. First, the good he
would do he does not. Second, the
evil he would not that he does. Life
is regenerated by purpose or must de
generate for the want of it. Life is
growth or decay. It has its electric
current of energy to pass over risht
conductors and move the wheels of
action to good, or over the grounded
wire to the wastet of itself and to th"o
destruction of others.
The tramp is but a person with an
aimless life. As such he is eccentric,
unbalanced, dangerous. Seeking to
exist rather than to live he is a failure
to himself and a 'menace to society.
Many belong to this class who are not
riding freight cars or begging bread.
They are clothed in purple and fine
linen and fare sumptuously every
day. They may dwell in palaces.
Yet life to them is as purposeless as
it is to those unfortunates who tramp
the land seeking rest but finding none.
The great problem to some people is
how to put in the time to their own
pleasure. To say the least, such lives
are sinful in the sight of God and
might be positively criminal in the
eyes of the law were it not that they
are raised above want by their money.
Life must be growth or decay. Let
the wicked demons find the heart
swept and garnished of purpose and
they will come with a band of their
own and set up the devil's workshop
from which his goods in deeds of the
flesh will be turned out in wholesale
quantities. The most dangerous temp
tations come to those who drift aim
less. Find a cure for idleness and the
remedy is at hand for half of the in
temperance and its consequent crime.
When a person has nothing behind to
which to tie and nothing before to
which to look there is a great tempta
tion to become nothing. Mrs. Anna
Edson Taylor was once a school teach
er. Life for some reason lost its pur
pose. She came to the time when she
cut loose from the good of the past
and seemed to have no purpose for
the future so she put herself in a
barrel shaped cask, went through the
rapids of Niagara and over the Can
adian falls. What was her reward?
The notoriety of being the only per
son up to that time who had gone over
the falls and come out alive. It was
cheap for the few dollars gained in
exhibiting herself weie soon spent
and her life remained purposeless.
When the nation of Poland ceased to
be its one ship out upon the ocean

DEGOHATIOH DAY
National Commander Mount Speaks
of the Widening "Margin Between
Living and Dead- Program For the
Thirtieth of May In Wauseon..
The following words from Com
mander Mount of the National En
campment G. A. R. are worthy of re
petition they are full of significance
that the American people will do well
to consider:
The 30th of May will be the 48th
anniversary of our beautiful Memor
ial Day. This day with its tender
memories has bee.i growing more and
more pathetic as the years go by. A
lew years ago 50 comrades with
bodies erect and step firm marched
to the cemetery and decorated the
graves of 10 or 15 of their fellow
comrades. Now the conditions are
sadly different, now 10 or 15 feeble
veterans struggle to the burying
ground and lay their loving tributes
upon 40 or 50 silent resting places of
comrades gone before. Soon it will
be The Last Comrades; Silent Tribute.
The coming 30th of May this year
will mark with more than telling em
phasis the widening margin between
the living and the dead. Let there be
no abatement of our devotion to the
memory of our comrades who have
heard the call of the commander and
gone to join the broken ranks on the
other side. Let us make our service
this year more tender and devotional
if possible, than ever before. Let our
example of loyal service to country
and of devotion and remembrance of
our comrades be a lasting tribute to
the membership of the Grand Army
of the Republic.
This day ought especially to comf
mand the attention of the sons and
daughters of the veteran soldiers.
They are our heirs and most natural
ly to them should descend the privi
lege of continuing Memorial Day af
ter the Grand Army has passed away.
They are next in blood and there are
no others to whom we can bequeath
the unfinished work we leave behind.
There are no others that will remem
ber us longer or guard more sacredly
our honorable and patriotic services
in the cause of the nation than the
sons and daughters in whose veins
run the blood of their Veteran Fath
ers. In Wauseon the program as arrang
ed by Losure Post No. 35 G. A. R. is

LARGER DEPOSITS.
Larger postal savings deposits will
now be accepted at the post office,
This is made possible by an import
ant amendment to the Postal Savings
Act just approved by President Wil
li. A postal savings depositor may
now have an account amounting to
$1,000 upon .which interest will be
paid. Formerly $500 was the maxi
mum amount he could have to : his
credit. This enlargement of postal
savings facilites will be very gratify
ing to thousands of depositors . who
have already reached the' old '$500
limit and are ' anxious ' to entrust
more of their savings to Uncle Sam.
Another feature of the ''amendment
that will avoid further embarrasment
to the public and to postal officials is
the doing away with the limit on the
amount that could be accepted from
depositor monthly. - Under the old
law only $100 could be deposited in
calendar month. : The amendment
abolishes this restriction. While . the
Postal Savings System has already
proved a Signal success as is . shown
by the fact that 'more than half-a-million
depositors have over -eighty
million dollars standing, to their
credit, still it has fallen 'short of
meeting the full -demands of the pub
lic because of the restrictions -which
have now. leen eliminated. Postmast
er General Burleson and Third Assist
ant Postmaster General Dockery have
been tireless in their efforts to secure
a modification of the limitations and
the new liberalizing s legislation is
particularly gratifying to them. ; '
