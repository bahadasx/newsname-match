DENIES INSANITY PLEA
New York Dentist on Stand
Declares He Did Not
Pose as Crazy.
New York, May 26. Women were
excluded from the court room when
Dr. Arthur W. Waite resumed his tes
timony in defense of himself against a
charge of having murdered his wealthy
father-in-law, John E. Feck, of Grand
Rapids, Mich.
Hundreds of persons in the corri
dors Tainly tried to gain admission to
the court room. Waite appeared pale,
but seemed lo have braced himself to
face the ordeal.
His counsel, Walter R. Denel, tolfi
Justice Shean that he had only a few
inpre questions to ask the dentist be
fore the cross examination would be
gin. "Did you ever try to kill your wife"
asked Mr. Deuel.
"No." replied Dr. Waite.
"Did you ever plan to kill her?"
"No, never."
"You never thought you might kill
her?"
"I am not sure that I would not have
killed her,' said Waite.
Assistant District Attorney Broth
ers then began the cross-examination.
"Do you recall telling me that you
did not want your wife to learn of
yonr relations with Mrs. Horton?"
"No," replied Waite.
Ponies Fakiwr Insanity.
Waite folded his arms and smiled at
the prosecutor as he denied having
any conversation with Mr. Brothers in
Dr. Waite's apartment.
"You were faking insanity in Belle
rue, were you not?" asked Mr. Broth
ers. "I didn't fake insanity at any time,"
eaid Waite.
"You faked insanity in the Tombs,"
said the prosecutor.
Waite denied it and also denied that
he deliberately planned a falso de
fense or read books on nervous dis
eases. "You have displayed a wonderful
memory for events back to yonr sixth
birthday but you have forgotten these
recent incidents," said the prosecu
tor. "I don't remember," said Waite.
"Yon don't wish to remember even
your letter to Margaret Horton?"
asked Mr. Brothers.
Waite did not answer.
Confused by Qnestions.
The smile gradually faded from his
face and he seemed to become con
fused by the rapid fire of questions.
The witness declared he did not tell
District Attorney Swann and Mr.
Brothers while in Bellevue that the
"man from Egypt" had killed Peck. He
said he had asked Mrs. Horton if she
had heard of the "man from Egypt"
but denied that he had otherwise
character.
"Are you crazy? asked Mr. Broth
ers.
"I think not."
"After you took Mr. Peck's life you
could not sleep, could you?"
"I slept perfectly," said Wafte.
"You wanted to kill yourself, did
you ?'
"Yes."
"You fixed the embalmer. What had
you to fear?"
"Well, this trial."
"Whv didn't you kill yourself?"
. . .. A .
I made a pretty gooa attempt u. m
replied Waite.
"If yon wanted to kill the Pecks,
why didnt you shoot them?" asked
Brothers.
"I don't know."
"You have never been anything but
a sneak thief, have you?" asked the
prosecutor.
That's all"
"You planned Peck's death to win
J2.000.000, didnt you?"
"No, not that much."
The prisoner denied that he-schemed
to kill Peck as early as last February.
"You and Margaret Horton were go
ing to leave the country, weren't you?
Where were you going?"
"I don't know that we were going
away."

tion in the French war office re
port of May 21 that the French
had retaken a part of Fort Jouaii
mont meets with a flat denial hy

command.
Since Fort flonaumnnt was first
reported taken on Feb. 25 it has
been continuously in (erman pos
session, it is asserted.
Berlin, May 26, (via London, 4:20

bank of the Meuse, extending their po
sitions to the west of Haudromont
quarry and crossing the Douaumont
ravine, the war office announced to

French were driven back further. The
Germans captured an additional 600
prisoners and 12 machine guns.
The text of the statement follows:
"Western front: On the east bank of
the Meuse we successfully continued
our attacks. Our positions to the west
of the stone quarry were extended, the
Douaumont ravine was crossed and
the enemy thrown further back. Six
hundred prisoners with 12 machine
guns were captured.
"On the left bank of the Meuse a
hand grenade attack by Turcos west
of Hill 304 was repulsed.
"In the vicinity of Loivre, northwest
of Rheims, a French gas attack was
ineffective.
"The enemy aeroplane brought down
south of Chatean-Salins, reported May
21, was the fifth put out of action in
aerial engagements.
Paris, May 26, (11:40 a. m.) There
has been little change in the situation
on the Verdun front, says the official
announcement issued by the war of

Germans between Haudromont wood
and Thiaumont farm. Otherwise the
battle front was calm.

"In the Argonne district" 5Ten5fi
troops exploded a mine with success
at La Fille Morte.
"On the left bank of the river Mouse

counter attack brought into our pos
session a. section of trench occupied
yesterday by the enemy at a point be
tween the wood of Haudromont and the
farm of Thiaumont North of this

OPEN PARLEY
OF LEAGUE TO
END ALL WAR
International Federation to
Curtail Strife Holding
First Session.
TO ENFORCE PEACE
Would Settle Disputes in
High Court Former
President Talks.
Washington, May 2(v The ob
ject of the League to Enforce
Peace is not to urge President
Wilson to take steps to stop the
present war. former President
Taft, president of the league, de
clared today in opening its two
day session here.
"We are not here," he said. "to
nnre upon the administration
steps to stop the present war.
Not that we are not hopeful that
snch steps may be taken, bnt we
believe that a definite purpose, a
pnrpose with limitations for an
association like this, is much more
likely to be realized than a gen
eral platform for the benefit of
humanity.''
The league hoped, Mr. Taft
said, for a world agreement on a
method of making war less prob
able. Washington, May 26. American ad
vocates of an international federation
i to curtail war, met here today for the
first assembly of the new league to
enforce peace. William Howard Taft,
president of the league, and Newton
D. Baker, secretary of war, were on
the day's program and President Wil
son's address at the closing session
fomorroV-Ttight will be a significant
utterance, it is thought. About two
thousand persons attended the meet
ing. Former President Taft's subject was
an explanation of why the constitu
tional authority of the president and
j congress to declare war, would not be
violated by the league's plan for a fed
eration of nations.
Speakers pointed out that war might
not be abolished but it would be cur
tailed, for the international league
would allow combat only if the court's
decree were not accepted by any na
tion. Thomas Raebnrn White, Philadel
phia lawyer, in1 his address sought to
answer arguments advanced against
the league's plan.
Edward A. Filene, Boston merchant.
declared European nations at the end
of the present war, would be favorable
to the league to enforce peace.
Other Speakers at Meet.
Other speakers on today's program
were Oscar S. Straus of New York,
member of The Hague court; Hamil
ton Holt of New York, editor of the
Independent; Professor George Graf
ton Wilson of Harvard university;
Talcott Williams, director of Colum
bia university school of journalism;
John Bates Clark of New York, direc
tor of a department in the Carnegie
endowment for international peace; R.
G. Rhctt of Charleston, S.C, president
of the chamber of commerce of the
United States; Samuel Gompers, pres
ident of the American Federation of
Labor and Oliver Wilson of Peoria,
I1L, president of the National Grange.
Taft Trges World Court.
Acceptance of membership by the
United States in a world court in
which the joint powers would use their
armed and economic forces to enforce
its decrees in the interest of interna
tional peace, was urged today by for
mer President Taft before the League
to Enforce Peace, of which he is presi
dent. His address was closely confined to
technical legal questions involved in
a joinder by the United States in such
an international tribunaL
Mr. Taft explained that the league's
platform proposes compulsory sub
mission to the world court of an in
ternational dispute not settled by dip
lomatic negotiations and which are
"justiciable questions."
Referring to the so-called Bryan
peace treaties with England and
Franre, Mr. Taft said It was argued
that the arbitration stipulation in
them was a delegation of the authority
of the president and senate over our
foreign relations.
"But upon reason and authority
this objection is untenable," said Mr.
Taft. Since the Jay treaty of 1794,
Mr. Taft stated, some American na
tion has been a party to 84 interna
tional treaties, of which the United
States was involved in two-thirds.
"In 10 of these, which were boun
dary treaties," Mr. Taft continued, "it
was never suggested that the govern
ment was delegating any power at all
to the tribunal. A submission of a ju
dicial question is not a delegation of
power to an agent it is a submission
of an Issue to a Judge and it is a mis
nomer to call such a Buhmisf on a
delegation.
Only Question of Law.
"The question whether a court has
jurisdiction is nothing but a question
of law. The senate has consented

AVER WILSON
WILL GLADLY
BOOST PEACE
President Reported Ready to
Act in Informal Way to
Aid Movement
Washington, May 26. From an au
thoritative source it was learned to
day that the president is preparing to
do everything possible in an informal
way to bring about the discussion of
peace between belligerent nations.
The president is convinced the war
is deadlocked and that a continuance
merely means the killing of more peo
ple and the further Impoverishment of
European nations, both belligerent and
neutral.
Mr. Wilson is understood to agree
with a suggestion that a peace follow
ing a decisive defeat of one nation or
group would create only lasting hatred
and sow seeds of future conflicts.
The president takes the position thgi
the neutrals of the world as much as
belligerents, have a right to participate
in any peace negotiations because the
economic results already developed
and those which will follow the con
flict. The president has been deeply inter
ested in the growth of peace talk
among responsible officials in several
of the belligerent nations during the
last three weeks. He has read and
filed away recent speeches by Presi
dent Poincare of France, Sir Edward
Grey, foreign minister of Great Britain,
and Chancellor von uetnmann-tlou
weg of Germany.

Riotsn Claim
London, May 26, (11:01 a. m.) An
Amsterdam dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company says that 18 wo
men were wounded in a fight between
police and food rioters at Frankfort-on-the-Main
Wednesday night, accord
ing to a dispatch received at The
Hague.
The riot is said to have started ow
ing to a shortage of meat in the local
butcher shops. Three hundred and
fifty women who had been told ther
was no meat for them, marched
through the streets carrying black
famine flags and singing socialistic
songs.
The women forced their way into
one butcher shop. After a search
they found some meat which they cut
up and continued their march holding
the pieces above their heads.
Police attempted to take their meat
from the women and a general riot
ensued in which the officers used their
swords. One woman was arrested for
shouting :"Down with the emperor."
A local paper which referred to the af
fair was ordered suspended for two
months.
LANSING DENIES
HE WILL RESIGN
Washington, May 26. The state de
partment made this statement regard
ing published reports that Secretary
Lansing was contemplating resigning
from the cabinet because of differences
with President Wilson:
"This story is part of a propaganda,
the dilberate purpose of which is to
create an appearance of dissension in
the government which does not exist.
The story was born last February or
March when the relations between the
United States and Germany were
somewhat strained. It was sent to
Berlin by wireless in press dispatches.
It was picked up in transit in an al
lied country and subsequently pub
lishede there. In that way the state
department became cognizant of the
storv and instructions were sent 10
Berlin to watch out for it. Appar
ently the persons responsible found
out we were prepared for the story,
hecause it never was published in
Germanv. The directors of thi
propaganda have now taken advantage
of Secretary Lansing's illness to put
the story out again.'
Mr. Lansing personally denied that
he was considering resigning.

GIRL SLAYER
REFUSED AID
FROM FATHER
Parent of Youth Held for
.Murder of Aurora Girl
Not to Defend Him.
Aurora, 111., May 26. W. J. Tyers,
state's attorney of Kane county, an
nounced today that he would recall
the May grand jury to consider the
case of Paul Verhoye, the 19-year-old
boy strangler, who has confessed to
the murder of his child sweetheart, 15-
year-old Gwendolyne Holden.
Hard on the heels of the state's at
torney's announcement that the prose
cution of the boy would be rushed, the
boy s father, David Verhoye, stated
that he would hire no lawyer to defend
the lad.
"He has got into this affair, let him
get out of it," the father said. "It has
taken me the 11 years I have been in
this country to get a home paid for
and I am not going to see lawyers get
it. He is not right mentally anyway.
The judge can see that"
The boy apparently is not agitated
in the least. He discussed the slaying
of the girl with the same calmness he
would a topic of ordinary interest
"I did not mean to kill her," he said
today, "but I was mad. She would not
give up her date with Harry Roe and
she laughed and I leaped upon her to
choke away her laugh. I was dizzy
when I got through choking her. When
she lay quiet I could not realize she
was dead. Then I went out and around
and it seemed like I was walking in
my sleep and everybody seemed
strange and I did not know where 1
was going."
Abruptly he stopped. Then he
leaned against the bars of his cell and
said softly, "I would like to see her
since she has been fixed up by the un
dertaker. She did not look good yes
terday. You would not know her as
the pretty girl she was. The police
promised me if I told all I could see
her when she was fixed up and looked
pretty again."
