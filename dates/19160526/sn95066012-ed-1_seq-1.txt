DEFENCES LOST
TO FRENCH
Sections of Trenches Captured By
Germans
ARTILLERY BUSY ON HILL TOP
In Counter Attacks French Are Re
pulsed and Lose Prisoners and
Machine Guns.
London, May 25. Further German
attacks were delivered today and last
night on the east bank of the Meuse,
but the battles had not the supreme in
tensity of those of the first days of the
week. At Fort Douauruont there were
no infantry attacks, though violent ar
tillery actions were carried on.
Just west of the fort on the front be
tween Thioumont Farm and llaudro
niont the Germans made a series of at
tacks, wnleh, the French bulletins say,
gave them "a section of trendies" at
one point and one trench to the north
of the Ilaudromont quarries, which
were captured recently by the
French.
On the west bank of the Meuse, the
Paris War Office reports the progress
of French forces immediately to the
east of Cumieres, captured yesterday
by the Germans. There were artillery
duels at Hill 304 and from Dead Man
Hill to Cumieres.
JJerlin, May 2o, (by Yv ireless to
Sayville.) The repulse of three coun
ter auacKs uy uie i-Tencn on tne village
of Cumieres to the west of the Meuse
on the Verdun front, was announced
by the War Office today. The capture
of additional French trenches south
west and south of Fort Douaumont.
and the recapture of the Ilaudromont
quarry by the Germans, are also re
ported. All day attacks by the French on the
German lines in the Caillette Wood,
southeast of Fort Douaumont in which
the French met with severe losses,
were beaten off by the Germans, who
report the capture of more than 850
prisoners and fourteen machine guns.
M. E. DISCIPLINE UNCHANGED
Members May Be Expelled for Partici
pation in Tabued Amusements.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 2fi.
The penalty of expulsion provided in
paragraph 271 of the discipline of
the Methodist Episcopal church for
members who play cards, dance, at
tend the theatre or engage in other
similar amusements, will remain in
effect for another four years at least,
as the result of action taken yester
day, by the general conference. An
attempt, which was led by Chancellor
James R. Day of Syracuse university
to secure the removal of the prohibit
ion failed by a vote of 431 to 30. Tho
figures are almost identical with those
of four years ago, when a similar pro
pcsal was defeated. Paragraph 271
of the discipline, which is the basic
law of tho church, was enacted in 1872
and has remained virtually unchanged
Jt reads:
In cases of neglect of duties of any
kind. Imprudent conduct, indulging in
sinful tempers of words, dancing, play
ing at games of chance, attending
theaters, horse races, circuses, danc
ing parties or patronizing dancing
schools, or taking such other amuse
ments as are obviously of misleading
or questionable moral tendency, or dis
obedience to the order and discipline
of the church; at the first offense let
private reproof bo given by the pastor
or class leader and if there bo an
acknowledgement of the fault and
proper humiliation, the persons may
be borne with. On the second offense
the pastor or class leader may take
with him one or two discreet members
of the church. On the third offense
let him be brought to trial, and if
found guilty, and there bo no real
sign of humiliation, he shall be ex
pel led.

r
Theodore N. Vail Likely to Head
Republican Delegation
HE IS A HUGHES MAN
Convention Larger Than Had Been
Expected Only One Contest
Probable.
Montpclier, May 2.". The gathering
of d( legates to the State republican
convention this evening took the na
ture of an enthusiastic republican re
union. In the absence of any contests
iu the State over the presidency la
connection with the convention it was
supposed there would be a compara
tively small attendance. As a matter
of fact the hotel corridors hae been
crowded this t veiling and there is
every indication of one of the most en
thusiastic and hit westing conventions
held in recent years.
Tho contests over the election of
delegates will lie more limited than at
first appeared likely, several of the as
pirants having decided not to make a
unites:.
The most important development by
far in connection with the Slate con
vention preliminaries, and the one
which will attract the widest attention
throughout the country, is the em
phatic statement by T. X. Vail in sup
port of Justice Hughes.
This announcement which was cir
culated thioughout the hotel corridors'
was received with enthusiasm in view
of the impoitance which delegates
knew would be attached to a declara
tion for Hughes from a man of world
wide fame like Mr. Vail.
The county delegates have agreed
to present the candidates in tomor
row's convention in the following or
der: T. X. Vail, E. H. Morse, George
H. lrouty, Collins M. Graves, Freder
ick II. Babbitt. Guy W. liaMey. John T.
dishing. Hugh J. M. Jones and G. E.
Moody, the latter being the only con
tes;.
One of tlio last developments of the
evening was the suggestion that unless
the Washington county delegates got
together and settled their difficulties
over the rival candidates, Mr. Jones
and Mr. Moody, the convention might
decide to drop both and select Mr.
Gridley of Windsor county.
Mr. Vail's name will he presented by
lexander Dunnett of St. Johnshury
and the other nominating speeches
will be made by the tollowiiiu: Collins
M. Graves by Frank C. Archibald: E.
R. Morse by Edwin W. Lawrence; Geo.

The committee on resolutions. Chas.
II. Darling of Burlington, chairman,
representing Chittenden county, was
completed tonight find met to draw up
the platform to be presented for con
sideration by the convention. The
committee will present a resolution,
probably separate from the platform,
endorsing Justice Hughes as the re
publican nominee, thus following the
precedent established at the time of
McKlnley's nomination. The resolu
tion will not. however, bind the dele
gates who will probably go to the na
tional gathering uninstnicted.

London. May 23. David Lloyd
George, Minister of Munitions, has
undertaken at the request of the Cabi
net to negotiate between the contend
ing Irish parties. The fact was an
nounced in the House of Commons this
afternoon by Premier Asquith in bis
expected statement on Irish affairs.
The Premier expressed the hope that
the disappearance of martial law,
which was being continued as a pre
cautionary measure, would be speedy
and complete.
The selection of Lloyd George ' for
the task of attempting the pacification
of Ireland was a surprise t the House,
which was appealed to by Mr. Asquith
not to debate Irish affairs pending
Lloyd George's negotiations. John Red
mond. Sir Kdward Carson and William
O'Brien, the Irish leaders, agreed to
this, and notwithstanding an attempt
by Luurenre Ginnell, a Nationalist
member, to make a speech, the sub
ject was dropped for the day at least,
Baron Stam ford ham; private secretary
to King George, was present and lis
tened closely to the Premier's speech.
He departed immediately afterward
and returned to the place to report to
tho King.
Mr. Asquith in his speech, referring
to the sacrifices that Irishmen had
made in behalf of the British Empire
during the present war, Faid:
"Could we who represent Great
Britain or could they who represent
Ireland toierate the prospect that
when this war whs over and when we
had by our joint efforts and sacrifices

should, achieved our end, that here at
home Irishmen should be arrayed
against one another in the most tragic
and most debasing of all conflicts
Internecine domestic strife? I say to
the House of Commons to the country
and to tht empire that the thought is
inconceivable. It can never be, for it
would mean confession of bankruptcy
not only of statesmanship, but of pa
triotism." Referiing to the Home Rule bill, Mr.

Prearranged Conversation Over
Tanned Telenhone Wires
CHARGES ARE FLATLY DENIED
Objected to Plan of Placing Children
of Institutions in Private
families.
Xew York, May 2G. Roman Catho
lic, clergymen whose telephone wires
were tapped during the investigation
of charitable Institutions took the wit
ness stand yesterday before the leg
islative committee headed by Senator
George F. Thompson and flatly denied
the charges of Mayor Mitchel that
they were involved in a conspiracy to
discredit the city administration
through attacks upon the department
of charities. They made the counter
allegation that the major played a
prominent part in a conspiracy de
signed to discredit the administration
of Catholic orphanages. The priests
asserted that after discovering their
telephones had been tapped they delib
erately planned to trap the mayor by
prearranged conversations and that
hev were successful in their our-
pose. lnle admitting certain parts
of the overheard conversations which
were read to the committee Wednes
day by Mr. Mitchel, the witnesses pro
tested that his account of these talks
was in the main, inaccurate. They
contendc 1 that the language used,
much of which was ungrammatical,
was not theirs.
Whatever was said in the conversa
tions about spiriting witnesses out of
the city to prevent them from appear
ing before the charities investigating
commission was deliberately planned
to delude the major and his associates
with the end in view of proving that
their telephones had been tapped, they
deeiared. The clergymen contended
that all they sought for the institu
tions in which they were interested
was a "square deal," which had not
been given them.
The witnesses who appeared yes
terday were Mgr. John J. Dunn, Mgr.
Luke J. Evers, Rev. William B. Far-
rell and Rev. Joseph P. Dineen. In
reply to a question early in the ex
amination of Mgr. Dunn arraigned
what be railed "the charity trust."
Its one and only aim," he declared,
is the secularization of all institu
tions. That explains what I have said
about trying 'to take God out of t lie
hearts' of our little ones.' I believe
firmly that children should be in
structed In the faith of their fathers."
The witness declared the charities
department had a plan to "farm out"
to 22.000 families the 22.000 children
who were in institutions in Xew York
city. "We want religious influences
surrounding our children," Mgr Dunn
said, "ami the Catholic chinch will
never permit its children to be taken
away lrom it."
Father Farrell denied positively
that he had ever taken part iu some
of the conversations attributed to him
bv the mayor. He declared that lie
"had a sort of lunate suspicion" that
his wire had been tapped and deter
mined to learn positively if that was
the case. He detailed at length his
relations with Mr. Mitchel, whom he
charged with "having -broken his word
in at least one instance."
Father lligglns, another witness
who has jurisdiction over 500 chil
dren, ho said, charged that "the mayor
of Xew York is dangling 22,000 chil
dren on statements of misrepresenta
tion." He defied any one to sliow that
the children iu Catholic Institutions
were not the equals of children in any
institutions in dress, education and
nourishment.

cherished such murderous thoughts
toward her as it is now believed lie
did.
The authorities were notified but
there was no cause for action as the
second bullet from drover's revolver
had placed him beyond the reach of
tho law.
The details of the man's visit to the
White home, which is several miles
from this village, are not known here
but It Is thought that Mrs. Grover

coming and purposely avoided meet

phoid, while he was studying bac
teriology. "Was there any arsenical flypaper
in her room?" the dentist was asked.
"Oh. yes," he answered. "I read
somewhere of an arsenical flypaper
which, if treated and put in a per
son's pocket, would cause death, so I
got some and put it in her room.
He had given Mrs. Peck millions
of germs, be said. Asked bow many
kinds of germs he administered to
Mr. Peck, Waite replied: "Typhoid,
diphtheria, pneumonia and others. 1
gave him a spray, and put diphtheria
and later pneumonia germs in it, and
had him spray his throat every time
he went out. They had no effect and
I tried to make them stronger.
"I put water in the sheets of his
bed so that be would catch cold, but
be didn't. 1 also put a chemical
compound in his room which would
create a poisonous gas, but it failed
to produce results. One night I turned

Waite told of sleeping on the couch
on the night before his father-in-law's

He got up an hour after retiring, he
said, and administered chloroform to

proper conditions the United States
government be asked to help finance
such a congress."
The co-ordination of the efforts ot
the women of North and South Ameri

ard accomplishing that end. In lino
with this idea, Mrs. Pennybacker, at
today's session, approved the report ot

boards will be installed in the armory
and if they are found effective the ses
sions will be resumed there.

alleged to be due to the presidential
hit ions of two Chicago women.

ceptions tonight. Mrs. Pennybacker
