NIGHT RIDERS
INDICTED BY
GRAND JURY
Charges Said to Be Con
spiracy Against Mrs.
Tlie federal grand jury, sitting at
Tacoma, last Saturday indicted 13
North River "night riders" and nine
have been arrested. Among the ar
rested men are Homer Blaine, Tren
ton Tidewell, John T. Howard, Claude
Vanderpool, Mike Hanrahan, Enoch
Dillard and James C. Simmons, deputy
sheriff of Pacific county. Charges are
said to be conspiracy against Airs.
Margaret M. Ross and her sons to
prevent their occupation of govern
ment land and interference with
George Wheaton, Alma DeLong and
Frank Martin, locators on North River.
Bail was put up by all the arrested
men, Raymond and South Bend rais

not friends with sufficient property
to go on their bonds. The two Willapa
Harbor towns, too, it is reported, are
raising a fund for the defense of the
indicted men. Citizens of Hoquiam
also are subscribing money for the
same purpose. No fund has been
started in Aberdeen.
(Editorial Comment).
In a great measure we have pur

rider" case of Pacific county.
We felt that much exaggeration, per
sonalities, vengeance and other un

game and usually before he quits,
there is "something doing." In this
case it looks as though about a score
of the ringleaders and law defying

GOOD ADDRESS
ON "DRY" LAW
Governor Tells Methodist Brotherhood
That Provisions Must Be Fol
lowed Stringently
Governor Ernest Lister made a
strong address last Monday night be
fore the St. Paul Brotherhood of the
Methodist church. He had no fault
to find with the provisions of the
"dry" law but urged that greater
stringency be exercised in enforcing
it.
Principal R. H. Wise of the Franklin
school presided at the Brotherhood
dinner, at which 100 attended, and
introduced the governor. "Good Citi
zenship" was the topic of his address.
The people of the state had shown
their possession of good citizenship
characteristics, he said, most strong
ly in the enactment of the "dry" law.
and travel in many sections of the
state had convinced him that citizens
more and more had come to recognize
the desirability of present over form
er "wet" conditions.
