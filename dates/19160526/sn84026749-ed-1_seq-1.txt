May Rename Bridge
. As Key Memorial
War" Department Would Have
Aqueduct Structure Bear
Patriot's Namo.
A movement to name the new Aque
duct bridge the Key bridge In memory
of Francis Scott Key was Inaugurated
by the War Department today.
Secretary of, "War Baker approved a
recommendation made by Col. C. A. F.
Flagler, engineer officer In charge
of the Washington riven and harbors,
that the bridge be -renamed. Secre
tary Baker then augeited the change
In a letter to the District Commis
sioners, whe have Joint control over
mo bridge.
Secretary Baker pointed out that It
Is peculiarly appropriate that the bridge
should be named in honor of Key,
since lis district terminus at 'inirty-
fourth and M streets will be near the
Koy mansion.
There la no memorial in Washington
to the author of "The Btar-Bpanglea
Banner," although a movement was on
foot at one time to preserve the Key
mansion. Secretary JJaker Is not cer
tain that the change In the name of
the bridge can be made without a Con
gressional act. This matter may be the
subject of conferences later between
tho Secretary and District Commls
sloners.

larlo Cervantes was killed by American

Cervantes was the leader of the ban-
dlts who have been terrorising this sec

various detachments which form tho
punitive expedition.
Ho was killed after ho attempted to

COLUMBUS. N. M., May 26. A grow
ing hostility to Americans has beep re
ported from along General Pershing's
line of communication Into 'Mexico,
Truck drivers handling communication
trains have so far been tho only suf
ferers, but there Is a growing fear
among army men nt the Columbus
base that th etenslon will result In con
flict between the troops.
Tho Carranza soldiers at the garrison
of rnreva Casas Grandcs, near tho
American base at Colonla Dublan. havo
been reported as strikingly hostile.
Several times recently the army motor
trains have encountered barbed vlro
obstacles In the roadway near that
town. The train Just arrived reported

PEACE LEAGUE WILL
T INTERFERE
Speakers at the First Corrfer
ence Declare That It Alms
Only to the Future.
"Wo are not here to urge upon the
present AdmlhlatraUon steps to atop the
present war.
"But we believe that a-definite pur
pose, a purpose with limitations for an
association like this. Is much more like
ly to be realized than a general platform
for the benefit of humanity.
"And, therefore, there Is enough to be
accomplished In our purpose to Justify'
Ing our Insisting upon Its limitations
without being held to a lack of approval
of other movements that we all do fa
vor, but which to Introduce Into
movement like this would minimise and
weaken our driving force for the par
ticular object wo havo In mind here."
For Conciliation Court,
Thus spoke former President William
Howard Tatt In his opening address at
tho first session of the conference which
began at tho Belasco Theater today un
der the auspices of the League to En
fnrco Pcaco for the purpose of formu
lating a plan that will bring about the
establishment of an International court
of conciliation that will go far toward
prevention of war' In the -future.
Tho single purpose advanced by the
leaguo la that any step toward forma
tion of such a court of International
conciliation that would consider ques
tions In dispute before nations resorted
to arms, and would enforce Its .decrees
and Judgment by tho combined eco
nomic and military forces of the coun

toward a permanent peace which would

Indications Seen of His Activity
in. Behalf of Folk for Vice
President. '
Though William Jennings Bryan Is
not a delegate to the Democratic con
vention nt St. Louis, there are Indi
cations' that Mr. Bryan Is trying In
various ways to Influence tho action of
that convention. The latest, as to his
activity, concerns the nomination of a
candidate for Vice President on the
Democratic tlckot.
In this connection. It appears there Is
much activity against Vice President
Marshall and while It will In all prob
ability not prevent his renomlnatlon, It
has caused 111 feeling.
Folk la Ambitious.
Former Gov. Joseph W, Folk, of Mis
souri, now counsel for tho interstate
Commerce Commission, Is ambitious tor
the Vlre Presidency. Bryan la credited
with indorsing tho Folk boom, on the
theory tho nomination of Folk would
please tho Bryon wing and help carry
Missouri. This has come to the ears ot
the Marshall adherents. They dd not
relish It, and If Mr. Bryan backs Folk
at St. i.ouls there will be a tine, old
fashioned row.
However, there are other phases of
the Vlco Presidential nomination on the
Democratic ticket." It is understood
from men high In Administration quar
ters that Senator Owen has received
flattering assurances that he would bo
an excellent nominee.
Boom On For Baker.
In some parts of tho country there
Is a boom on for Secretary of War
Baker for Vlco President. This talk
has become so strong as to embarrass
Mr. Baker. The other day he called on
the Vice President and It la rumored
he sought to show Mr. Marshall that he
was not seeking tho office and wanted
him renominated.
It lias been well known for some time
that the Administration was not par
ticularly well disposed toward Marshall.
But It fears to make an open effort to
prevent his renomlnatlon. The result
will doubtless be that the renomlnatlon
will bo given him.

HOSPITAL SUBJECT
Congressmen 'Johnson and Mon

-Debate, v - j-w. -
Because the District appropriation
bill Tails to Include' provision for A
new municipal hospital, the House
today engnged In a lively debate on
tho subject of the hospital, and a
verbal clash occurred between Chair
man, Betr Johnson of the District
Committee and Congressman Moridell
of. the Appropriations Committee.
"A cat nnd dog fight Is ROlng on In
the District ovr this hospital," was
tho wuy Congressman William Schley
Howard, of tho Appropriations Com
mittee, explained the absence In the bill
of the hospital Item. The public con
troversy, he said, had reached such a
stage "that It looks like thore will be
Sio municipal hospital unless It Is lo
cated on the present cite."
Following the flurry over the hos
pital site Issue the House made rapid
progress on the District bill and It
became practically assured that the
measure would pass beforo adjourn
ment late today.
Congressman Mondell demanded to
know why the House District oCm
mlttee had not brought in a hospital
bill.
"Why doesn't the District Committee
actT' demanded Mr. Mondell. repeat
ing the question a half dozen times
h. nrnnrt About his desk.
Chairman Johnson, of the District
Committee, made no reply at the Ume.
"Don't ask me." finally said Congress
man Howard. "Why do you not climb
a greased pole backward, with your
arms "full of eels?"
Mr. Mondell parried this retort by
uvlnir: "If It were my sworn duty to
do It. I would make a start. The Dis
trict Committee docs not even start."
Congressman Howard said that there
were thqusands of dons In the District
recelvlng'better care than the poor sick

tho site controversy declaring that
privately owned hospitals and property

ents, Mr. and Mrs. John' E. Peck,

ine Peck, her aunt, was made on

-Waite replied:
"I think not.

"Didn't you say at Beltevue that you

"I did."
"Do you care nqw what becomes of

"I want to do what Is right."
"What did you take the sulphonol and

"I wanted to kill myself."
Walte finished his testimony jind left

calm.
The greatest crowd that has stormed
the criminal courts building since the
opening of the sensational trial was on

women were waiting before the doors

crowd In check, but a scramble ensued
Immediately prospective spectators were
permitted to file In. Women were bar
red. Mrs. Horton and the "Man fvom
Egypt" fluured In Walte'a testimony
when the cross-examination was taken

"Do you remember telling Detective

An objection to this was sustained.
When Brothers asked Walte If ho ex
