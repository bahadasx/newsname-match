Extracts From Speech
Made by Him on the
Floor of the House of
Representatives, May
12, 19 J 6.
The very" first law (The Under
wood Tariff Act) that was pass
ed after the Wilson administra
tion came in power, exempted
from the Civil Service Regula
tions more than six hundred
agents, deputy collectors, inspec
tors and other income tax em
ployees to be employed in the
collection of the new Internal
Revenue taxes.
In the very first general Defi
ciency bill put upon the Statute
books by the Wilson administra
tion. There was a provision au
thorizing appointments, and re
movals, without reference to the
Civil Service Act 1145 Deputy
Collectors of Internal Revenue
and 176 Deputy U. S. Marshalls.
When the Federal Revenue
Banking Law was enacted the
Democrats over the earnest pro
test of the Republican members
of Congress, inserted a provis
ion in it exempting from the clas
sified competitive test, all appoin
tees of the Board.
By an act of Dec. 17 1914, (38
Stat 739) over the protest of Re
publican Members of congress,
there were exempted from com
petive te3t 200 employees in the
Interna Revenue Service to en
force the provision of the act re
gulating the distributing and sale
of narcotices.
By the act of Dec. 26, 1914, the
Democrats again ignored their
platform pledge and exempted
irom the Civil Service laws, the
secretaries, clerks, attorneys,
special experts and examiners m
the Federal Trade Commission.
By an act of July 16, 1914, the
Democrats again forgtt all about
their sacred promises to the Amer
ican people to uphold the Civil
Service laws, when they exempt
ed from competive test the com
mercial attachies in the Depart
ment of Commerce.
The Democratic Party by the
act of Jan. 28, 1915, again re
minded the American people that
it had no regard for its platform
pledges when it included in the

Coast Guard, and relieved them
from the Civil Service laws, the
members of the Life Saving Ser
vice. By the acts of March 4, 1913,
Aug. 1, 1915, and other acts, the
Democrats have shown their ut
ter disregard for Civil Service
laws, and their platform pledges
to uphold them.
Following the unhappy advent
of tHe Wilson Administration,
with bugle blasts, it manifested
its purpose to put the 45,000
fourth class postoffices in this
country into the classified service,
or rather the people to fill them.
Where the salary of the office
per annum ranged between $180
and $500, a competive examina
tion was required for appoint
ment. The three making the
highest on the examination were
elegible to appointment. Since
the Democratic pie distributors
had the right to recomend any
democrat in the list of elegibles
and since he was sure to be ap
pointed and since this, by experi
ence became to be an accepted
fact among republicans, natural
ly they did not trouble themselves
to take the examinations, know
ing that it would profit them noth
ing. In this way and by this
clever rush the Democratic poli
ticians found a way to put deserv
ing Democrats into most of the
postoffices of this whole country
where the salary ranged from
$180 to $500 annually. They did
it, too, under the guise of extend
ing the Civil Service. The post
masters in all the 4th class post
offices in the whole country t
where the salary of the office is,
less than $180 annually they now
have appointed upon the recom
mendation of postoffice inspectors
sent to the locality for that pur
pose. Post Office Inspectors under a
Democratic Administration na
turally recommend, when they
can, democrats to hold offices.
No doubt they have been taught
to believe that it stands them in
hand to do this, since every post
office inspector appointed by this
administration has been a Demo
crat. Not a single Republican
have they appointed. By these
methods substantially the whole
postoffice force of the country is
now Democratic. I know that
that is true in the district I have
the honor to represent. Other
members of Congress say it is
true as to their districts, although,

Mrs. Blanche Hale Golden, wife of J. Lynn Golden, won first
prize in the "Beauty and Brains Contest" given by the World
Film Company. Barbourville citizens should feel proud that we
have the prettiest woman out of the 132,000 who submitted their
photos from all over the United States and Canada.
Mrs. Golden was born in Tennessee in the year 1892, and came
to this county when she was but eleven years old. She was

country are Republicans still hold

This complete overthrow of the
merit system, the turning out of
office trained and experienced
Republicans, and putting in their
places untrained and inexperienc
ed Democrats, has given us the
poorest mail service within the
recollection of this generation. x
Business men have bitterly
complained at the confusion and
delay in the transmission and de
livery of the mails, but the rural
districts have suffered most in
the shortning and abolishing of
routes for the sake of economy in
the Post Office Department. And
while it would appear that the
Democratic politicians ought to
be satisfied with the nuniber of
republican postmasters they have
turned out of office and the num
ber of democrats they have put
in, still their thirst seems insa
tiable, only last year they tried
to put all the assistant postmas
ters of the country, in the larger
sized offices, under the spoils sys
tem but failed. Now' they are
trying a method. They are re
sorting to a most revolutionary
and far reaching plan to make a
political machine out of the en
tire post office force and system.
There passed the United States
Senate on March 15, 1916, a bill
styled a "Postal Saving's" bill,
containing this provision:
Sec. 18 "That hereafter the
Postmaster General may eatab
lish, under such rules and regu
lations as he may prescribe, one
or more branch offices, nonac
counting offices, or stations of
any pott office for the transaction

be required for the convenience
of the public."
It looks innocent. It appears
harmless. Its purpose seems to
be studiously concealed in the
language used. Let me reveal
its meaning through the gentle
man from Wisconsin' Mr. Stec-
nerson, the ranking Republican
member on the Post Office and
Post Roads Committee. He said
concerning it:
"It amounts to this, that the
Postmaster General can abolish
some fifty-odd thousand post
offices and annex them as sub
stations to the principal offices
that he may select. It is propos
ed by some to make the country
a postal division under this bill
and the First Assistant Post
master General stated in the hear
ings that he would have authori
ty under the law to establish one
post office in each county of the
United States and have all the
other offices as substations.
Now, there are 533 first-class
offices, 2,139 second-class offices,
5,278 third-class offices, and 56,
3S0 fourth-class offices in the U.
S. If that plan as proposed should
go though, it would be possible,
and it is evidently the intention
of the department to make one
uost office in each county. There
are 3,000 counties in the United
States. You would therefore
abolish something like 55,000
or 56,000 post offices and make
them substations. It would cre
ate that many vacancies to be
tilled whether they appointed the
the old postmasters as superin
tendents of substations or select
ed new men. If you do alway
with the many thouaandiof llttl
postmasters who receive but a
small pittance for their services,
and put those little offices' and
substations in charge of clerks at
$1,200 a year, which is the way
it is proposed to furnish efficient
men such as they have not got in
the local communities, it would
increase the expense of the Pos
tal Service. If you pass this law
you could make vacancies for
56,000 men, to be filled in this
case by worthy Democrats, and
then put them into the civil ser
vice forever. As to the efficien
cy, who can tell?
I do not believe this bill will
become a law at this session of
Congress. There are men in this
House, Democrats though
are, who will not stand for
legislation.
In my judgment the Democra
tic majority in this House is too
small to pass this bill at this time
but with a larger Democratic ma
jority, in all probability, it would
go through. But that majority
will not be larger for years to
come. The people will have their
say about that in November.
When they have spoken again
there will be returned to this
House an old time republican
majority.
The Democratic Party has been
weighed in the .balance, found
wanting. It has failed to keep
the faith.
The Democratic leaders have
broken their Baltimore platform
pledges on the Immigration ques
tion, and the labor question.
They reversed themselves com
pletely on the Panama Canal tolls
plank. Their broken pledges of
economy is kneiwn of all men and
denied by nobody. The high cost
of living has scared still higher
since their advent into power, al
though they pledged themselves
to reduce it at once. The only
reason they can give for it is that
iUias gone higher because it has
not come lower. They promised
they would put a tariff law on
the Statute books of our country
that would not injure legitimate
industry.
And yet but for the European
war, the darkest and grimest pa
nic this country has ever seen
would now be upon us. They
said that the laboring classes, a-
long with the great masses of our
citizenship were staggering un
der the weight and burden of
robber protective tariff laws.
They promised relief in Free
Trade. They promised the Iabor

A ROLL OF HONOR BANK
Is one whose surplus is equal to its capital
stock. "The Financier", a paper published in New
York, gets from the Government the names of all
banks whose surplus is equal to its capital, and pub
lishes them as HONOR ROLL BANKS. Thus if a
bank has a capital of $15,000.00 and a surplus of
$15,000.00 it is an "Honor Roll Bank" just the same
as a bank with a MILLION DOLLARS of CAPITAL
and a MILLION DOLLARS of SURPLUS.

SAMPSON THE
PEOPLE'S CHOICE
Spoke In the Interest of
His Candidacy to Large
and Enthusiastic Crowd
at London Monday.
Special to The Advocate:
London, May 23, 1916. -Judge
Sampson spoke in the interest of
his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for Appellate Judge
and was enthusiastically greeted
by a large number of voters, as
sembled in the court house. It
they was the opening day of the Lau
this rel Circuit Court and an unusually
large crowd was in town. The
Judge found the same condition
prevailing in Laurel county as
exists in so many other counties
visited; that is, that the farmers
and laboring men are for him,
and want him to be their Judge.
They will give Sampson a l ousing
big vote in Laurel. At this
stage of the camoaign, it looks
like Sampson will carry in addi
tion to the counties in his own
Circuit Court District, also all
the counties of the 26th and 27th
Judicial Districts, and will get a
good vote over any candidate all
over the western end of the Ap
pellate District. He will get
votes in other parts, and sufficient
to insure his nomination by good
safe plurality. Judge Sampson
is the people's choice. Every
where he is being supported by
the good, honest laboring man.
He has always been their friend
and stood for their rights. The
people can trust him.
On Sunday Judge Sampson,
and his friend, Judge William
Lewis, Mrs. Lewis, J. M. Robsi
on, J. L. Harrison and many
others went out from London to
the Baptist Association at Bush,
some twelve miles from London.
There were, it is said, more than
fifteen hundred people there.
Judge Sampson was called for
and delivered an address on that
occasion. Judge Lewis also made
a short talk. At all places visit
ed the people were enthusiastic
for Sampson.
