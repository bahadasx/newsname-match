CHARGE FAILS
TO
Judge Lewis Directs Verdict ol'
"Not Guilty"
in
Mock Case
WRONG INDIAN KNOCKS
Judge Lewis yesterday directed
verdicts of "not guilty" in the cases
of the United States against J. J.
Mock of Ijeitli, Morton county, and
James Quinn of Bismarck. Mock was
held on a white slave charge and
Quinn was charged with selling li­
quor to an Indian. In the first case,
the government failed to establish a
case under the Mann act and in the
second the wrong Indian was named
in the indictment. District Attorney
Hildretii announced that the case
would be presented to the grand jury
in Fargo, June 6, when court con­
venes again. Judge Xinidon is ex
pected to preside at that session.
Sudden Climax.
The case against Mock came to
a sudden climax as soon as the gov­
ernment rested. (Mock was charged
with taking the wife of Harry Unop
olis, a section boss on the St. Paul
road, from Leith to Mobridge, S. D.,
for immoral purposes.
The husband rode in the mail car
and trailed the couple to a hotel,
where the two registered under an
assumed name as man and. wife.
Then Unopolis got the chief of po­
lice and caused the arrest of Mock.
Consented to Trip.
HJnopolis admitted on the stand that
he had consented to the trip and fur­
nished his wife with a pass to go
and that the journey was for the pur­
pose of filing on government land.
The defense also contended that all
arrangements were- satisfactory.
Mock denied any improper relations
and certain testimony tended to con­
firm this. Francis Murphy and Judge
Carpenter of Mobridge represented
Mock.
Judge Lewis made it very plain in
directing a verdict that under the ev­
idence introduced there was no of­
fense committed in violation of a fed­
eral statute. !He outlined the purport
of the Mann act and showed concise­
ly why it did not apply in this in­
stance.
Schmidt Judy Out.
The jury in the case of the United
States against Fred W. Schmidt, the
former Fort Rice postmaster, charg­
ed with embezzling approximately
$5,000 of government funds, went out
yesterday afternoon. About 10 o'clock
last night it returned for further in­
structions. Judge Lewis stated that
they could return a sealed verdict to
be presented by the foreman of the
jury in court today.
This case has attracted consider­
able notice. It ha3 been stubbornly
fought. A year ago there was a dis­
agreement upon one indictment.
Then upon motion of Andrew Miller,
one of Schmidt's attorneys, the same
indictment was knocked out. During
the present trial several counts were
withdrawn by government counsel
and several more dismissed by the
court.
IMPLEMENT MAN TO FARGO.
Fargo, N. D., May 2-5.—B. G. Baker
of Chicago, who was manager of the
J. I. Case company branch in Minne­
apolis several years, was appointed
manager of the North Dakota branch,
of the Advance-Rumely company in
Fargo. He succeeds J. D. Adshead,
who retired to enter private busi­

TESTIFY III WIRE
Roman Catholic Clergymen On
Stand and Deny Mayor
Mitchell's Charges.
New York, May 25—Roman Catho­
lic clergymen whose telephone wires
were tapped during the investigation
of charitable institutions took the wit­
ness stand today before the legisla­
tive committee, and denied the
charges of Mayor Mitchell, that they
were involved in a conspiracy to dis­
credit the city administration through
attacks upon the Department of Char­
ities.
They made the counter allegation
that the Mayor played a prominent
part in a conspiracy designed to dis­
credit the administration of Catholic
Orphanages. The priests asserted
that after discovering that their tele­
phones l'.ad ten tapped, they delib­
erately planned to trap the Mayor by
prearranged conversations, and that
they were successful in their purpose.
While admitting certain parts of the
overheard conversations, which were
read yesterday by Mr. Mitchell, the
witnesses protested that his account
of these talks, in the main, were in­
accurate. Tney contended that the
language used was not theirs.

the iSoo Line here, and on May 7 se­
cured a week's leave.
He was last seen'starting for the
Red Lake agency, in a launch, with
his family. When he did not return,
inquiries were made and it was found
that he had not reached his destina­
tion, and a systematic search was in­
stituted. Sheriff Larbee, who be­
lieves the family drowned, left today
for Neptune, on Red lake, to search
for the missing family.

ATTEMPT TO PROVE

Prisoner's Story Is Shocking
Stole Fi'6m Karly Child­
hood.
New York, N. V., May 25
Dr. Arthur Warren Waite calmly
recounted on the witness stand to­
night in an effort to save himself
from conviction for ihe murder of his
father.in-law, John J'eck, by show­
ing he was of uns^t'd mind, how he
attempted to cmbufliHu tfeuih W Miss
Katherine Peck, the wealthy aunt of
his wife, and his own benefactor, by
feeding her disease Kornis. He also
told of trying to kill his wife's par­
ents, Mr. and Mrs. John E. Peck, in
the same way, before resorting to
poison as a more effective means. He
testified in addition regarding his re­
lations with Airs. Margaret Horton,
his "studio" companion.
Puts Germs In Food
Waite said lie put ground glass in
a can of marmalade, and gave it to
Miss Katherine Peck prior to his
marriage. He also put disease germs
in a can of fish and gave that to
her. Afterwards, he frequently gave
various germs, including typhoid,
while he was studying bacteriology.
He tried to produce the germs him­
self, he said, but his cultures failed
and he purchased them. He was
able to buy germs of dyphtheria,
pneumonia, inilucnza and other dis­
eases.
"What did you want of the germs,'
he was asked.
"1 wanted to give them to certain
people," lie said.
The trouble with the germs, Waite
said, was that they were not viru­
lent enough. He began to take an
interest in bacteriology long before his
marriage, he explained. After he had
given germs to Miss Peck for a while
he became discouraged because of
his lack of success. He put germs in
her food, hut he denied that he save
her arsenic.
"Did you administer any bacteria to
Mrs. Peck?"
"Yes, soon after she arrived 1 had
been working on them for some time
and had them all ready for her."
"How often did you give them to
her?"
"Quite often. I put them in her
food on the first day she came, and
she grew ill almost immediately."
He gave Airs. Peck millions of
germs, he said.
He gave Airs. Peck millions of
germs, he said.
Asked how mapy kinds of germs
he administered to Mr. Peck, Waite
replied:
"Typhoid, pneumonia and others. I
gave him a spray and put diphtheria
and later pneumonia germs in it and
had him spray his throat every time
he went out. They had no effect, and
I tried to make them stronger.
"I put water in the sheets of his
bed so that he would catch cold, but
he didn't. I also put a chemical com­
pound in his room which would cre­
ate a poisonous gas, but. it failed to
produce results. One night I turned
on the gas, but the superintendent of
the building came up and turned it
off.
Gives Him Arsenic.
"I gave him arsenic a few days be­
fore he was planning to go away. I
got »0 grains, I think. I think it was
three or four days before Mr. Peck
died that I began to givie him arsenic.
I gave him a little at first and in­
creased the dose until all of it was
gone. I gave him the doses in his
food. Once or twice, it was in egg
nog and once in rice pudding, and
then once in hot milk."
Waite told of sleeping on the
couch the night before his father-in-

The battle of Verdun continues un­
abated. On both sides of the Meuse
river, northeast and northwest of the
fortress, the Germans are keeping up
their unprecedented bombardment
and vicious infantry attack, while
the French are replying to the fire
almost shot for shot.
One more gain, however, has been
made by the Germans. After recap­
turing Kort Douauniont and taking
trenches south and southwest of the
fort, the Germans to the west have
occupied a section of French trenches
after a series of attacks, in all of
which they were repulsed with heavy
casualties, except those where they
penetrated the French line.
Artillery Duel.
Around Douauniont, a heavy artil­
lery duel is in progress. An attack
against the Russians west of Dalin

Judge Nuessle's Opinion Anal­
yzed by City Attorney
McCurdy.
DISTRICT JUDGE SETS
FORTH PROCEDURE
Although County Auditor Flaherty
has published the names of the elec­
tion inspectors named by the county
commissioners, and Judge Nuessle has
quashed the writ of mandamus direct­
ing him to recgnize the inspectors ap­
pointed by the city commission, it
now develops that this all transpired
because the city commission did not
procede correctly in the first place.
It is now proposed to proceed in
line with the ruling of Judge Nuessle,
which is that the city commissioners
must cast, lots and the one decided
upon in this manner will act as in­
spector in his precinct and name the
other inspectors.
MoCurdy's Report
This was embodied last evening in
a report given by City Attorney Mc­
Curdy upon Judge Nuessle's ruling.
The impression at first was because
the writ was quashed, this had the
effect of confirming the county com­
missioners' appointments.
It now develops that the writ was
quashed because the city commission
did not proceed regularly in naming
the inspectors.
May Name Inspectors
The commission probably when
they meet next Monday will name six
inspectors in line with Judse Nuessle's
ruling, and then it will be up to Fla­
herty to decide to which set of in­
spectors he will deliver the election
supplies. Those contending that the
city commission has the right declar­
ed last evening that further action
would be taken if necessary to de­
termine where the appointive power
lay. Judge Nuessle while outlining
the method of procedure has not yet
formally passed upon the city com­
mission's authority. It is also said
that the publication of the county
board's inspectors in the election no­
tices does not prejudice any of the
city's rights in the matter.
Accept Booster Pumps
Another matter of importance pass­
ed upon by the commission last ev­
ening was the formal acceptance of
the booster pumps. Several tests
were made this week and the pumps
met every requirement of the ordin­
ance.
An ordinance requiring that all wa­
ter and gas service pipes into build­
ings be lead was placed on its first
reading.
City Engineer Atkinson was in­
structed to secure plans and specifi­
cations to make the pest house hab­
itable. CondiUons there are deplor­
able.

LOCAL BUSINESS ORGANIZATION, THROUGH ITS DI«

IMMEDIATE ACTION ON PROPOSITION.
Pretiminary steps were taken by the City commission last
evening toward the proposed .$400,000 paving project for the
city of Bismarck. Petitions representing more than a ma­
jority of all property owners \verc filed with the City Com­
mission by W. E. Lahr, chairman of the Commercial Club
Paving committee, who, together with Carl Pederson and G.
C. Wachter, compose the Paving committee of tlic club.
Mayor Lucas tendered the thanks of the City Commission
to the club members for their interest in tlie matter. Secret
tary Price of the club was present and assisted in the pres­
entation of the petitions.
Accompanying the petitions was a letter signed by Mr.
Lahr which indicates the enthusiasm for paving in Bismarck
and reflects the unanimity of the properly owners for this
much needed improvement.
~w
The following letter was jresen*.el
with the petitions:
The iHonorable City Commission, City
of Rismarck, North Dakota. ,:Vr,
Gentlemen:
The Paving Committee of the Bis­
marck: Commercial club herewithre*
spectfully presents petitions ropre-.
senting 54.3 per cent of tbe front
footage involved: f»1.4 per cent of the
individual property -owners effected,
and. 03 jierj^ent of thrre!i16tit prop*
erty 'owners" concerned, praying for
the creation in Bismarck of a paving
district, as outlined ra the preamble
of said petitions.
Total of 100,138 Feet.
The proposed district embraces a
total of 100,135 front feet the sign*
tures upon the petitions presented
herewith represent 54^00 front feet,
or 54.i3 per cent of the total.
The whole number of individual
owners in the proposed district is
527. Of these, 271, or 51.4 per cent
of the total, have endorsed the pro­
ject by signing these petitions. Of
the 256 property owners not repre­
sented here, 85 are non-residents,
leaving out of a total of '527, but 171
resident property owners who are not
petitioning for this improvement.
The total front footage remaining:
unsigned to date is 45,738. Of this
amount there is owned by non-resi­
dents '9,095 feet, indicating that 63
per cent of all the resident property
included in the proposed district is
signed for.
Little Opposition.
The committee has encountered lit­
tle active opposition to the pavinff
project. A majority of those ap­
proached but who did not care to
sign, expressed themselves as not op­
posed to the improvement. Less than
a score of all the property owners
in Bismarck who have been inter*
viewed by the committee have declin­
ed to petition for the creation of the
paving district of these, not more
than half a dozen have declared-,
themselves opposed to the project in
its general features, and all of the'
remainder have expressed a willing­
ness to abide by the decision of the
majoritq.
Decided Sentiment.
The committee has found a veryv
general and a very decided sentiment
for immediate action. It is felt that
there is no good reason why actual
paving, in the downtown district, at
least, should not begin this year. The
petitioners herewith represented,
pray that the preliminary work pro­
ceed with all possible dispatch. It tar
universally felt by the property own­
ers and tax payers interested in this.,
project that much of the beneficial
effect which is expected from the im-'
provement will be lost unless them
is something definite in the way oft'
accomplishment to show for the Cap*.
ital City when the legislature con*
venes next winter.
In connection with the proposed im«|
provement, the committee begs the||v
liberty of calling attention, to the facfej.- J
that Bismarck is notr now
under heavy tax burdens, as caavarn^
ed wih other (North Dakota cities ot:v
