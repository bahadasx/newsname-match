Mother-in-law, His Best Friend, Succumbed
Quickly?Husband Annoyingly Imper
vious to Bacilli?Poison Used.
Twelve fascinated jurors sat late in Justice Shcarn*? eourt?
room last night, listening to as weird a murder story a.-- yellow
back ever held.
What they heard was Dr. Arthur Warren V.aite's full and
free confession to the murder of John E. Peck. of Grand Rapids.
; his wealthy fathcr-in-law ; to the poisoning of his mother-ifi-law.
and to the attempted murder of his uitVs Lady Bountiful aunt.
It was the story of a psychological hybrid, half man. half
boy?kindly. considerate and courteous gentleman at casual con?
tact. but so astounding.lv lackintf in moral sense that ihe life of
another. or the lives of many others. weigrhed not a whit against
s'-lf-interest.
Waite a SmUing Witne-^.
The Dr. Waite who told the gtory was almost the same Dr.
Waite whose personal charm made him so popular a few months
ago in local tennis circles and in the homes ot' scores of friends.
On the men who are to decide whether hc goee from the eourt?
room to the electric chair or to an institution for the criminal in
f ane, he turned his old ingenuous, disarming smile as. in shud
dering detail, he recited ;,;
Apparently he was at perfect ease. The tenseness of the
'situation served to speed his politelj drawied answers no more
hhan did the evident detormination of thc coiir. to eliminate
Idelay. When hc did not catch one of the qm'stions put by his
lawyer. Walter R. Deuel, he murmured invariably an apoiogetic
"Pardon!" And then. when he heard. it was a still mort ftpolo
gntic: "Oh. oh. yes!"
