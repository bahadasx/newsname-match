THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
The last week has been a strenuous
one all along the western front, and
ooth sides claim gains. The first of the
week the French recaptured Fort
Douaumont that was captured by the
Germans at the beginning of the assault
of Verdun. But yesterday's dispatches
indicate that the Germans have again
taken possession of that coveted strong
hold.
The Austrians and Italians have been
engaged in some of the heaviest en
counters since the war started, with
alight gains in favor of the Austrians,
as reports would indicate, It is claimed
lhat this offensive move on the part of
the central powers is to offset the pro
mised general assault which the Allies
are supposed t6 launch the beginning of
June.
Persistant reports are in circulation
that Prince von Buelow, who is consid
ered the nearest representative to the
£mperor is on his way to the United
States on a mission of peace. These
rumors have not been confirmed.
A LEAGUE LEGISLATURE.
The Fargo Courier News and the
Grand Forks Herald are authorities for
the statement that the Non-partisan
League is requiring legislative candi
dates to take a pledge to the effect that
in all legislative matters affecting farm
ers' interests that the members signing
will place themselves under the control
of the "League" and vote as they are
told to do by the "League." Whether
the candidates for the Supreme court
will be required to sign a similar pledge
is not yet known.
That a legislative candidate should
pledge himself in advance to vote on
future questions none of which can pos
sibly now be known, in obedience to the
dictates of any one man or any body of
men, is not only absurd but in itself
ought to be sufficient to debar bim from
membership in the legislature. Some
tines there are direct issues up before
the psople, when it is perfectly proper'

ly promise to vote on unknown ques
tions just as some certain somebodies
tell him. to vote.
The question as to who is to tell the
possible legislator bow to vote is also a
matter of consideration. It is possibly
a fact that in the case of some few mem
bers of the legislature in past years that
it might ha\e been a good thing for
some intelligent person to have advised
them how to vote, but an this case the
question is who is, or who are, the
league" that proposes to use the mem
bers of the legislature as their own
creatures whom they are to lead with a
string.
Most political organisations grow from
tie ground up. They start with the
people. The people get interested and
organize, that is, they elect officers, form
constitutions and by-laws and platforms,
The Non-partisan League appears to
have reversed the usual direction of
growth. It started in the air and grew
downwards towards the earth. It be
gan with a president, vice-president, etc
and thus downwards to the people. Mr.
"President" Townley was not only the
originator of the "League" but was the
"League" and bo far is still the ''League."
He has simply permitted other persons
to join with him, and to pay him six and
nine dollars each. He appoints all sub
ordinate officials, and his Non-partisans
are but members who work under his
orders—and board themselves.
The constitutions of the United States
and of the State of North Dakota say
that "all power is derived from the peo
pie" but in the case of the Non-partisans
"all power is derived from President
Townley."
And if this man who was kicked out
of the Socialist party along with his half
a dozen immediate associates succeed in
getting a majority of the members of the
North Dakota legislature, then this man
becomes the political boss of this state.
This man Townley who has a half mil
lion dollars of unpaid chattel mortgages
against bim according to the books, who
is an outcast from the Socialist party
because of crooked work, will become
the autocrat of North Dakota as he now
is of the Non partisan party. This man
who deliberately declares himself the
foe of all business interests except those
of farmer:*, is to be the sole legislator.
He will have a governor to sign the bills
that his servant legislators will pass in
"the sole interests" of the farmer and
against all other business interests. A
doctrine which in itself is so absurd that
it stamps President Townley as about as
big a fool as ever set himself up as a
political wiseacre.
Can a candidate for the legislature
conscientiously present himself before
the voters as a republican or a democrat
when he has pledged himself to vote in
the legislature as Townley directs, and
who has further agreed to vote against
the principals and candidates of his pro
fessed party?
Can a man honestly ask for and vote
a republican or democratic billot at the
primary election when he has already
declared his intention to vote against all
his professed party candidates at the
November election who are not "endors
ed" by Townley?
A partisan under North Dakota statu
tes is a man who affiliates with and ad
heres to the principles and candidates
of a party.
A non-partisan is a person who affili
ates with no party.
There is nothing to hinder a man from
being either, but he cannpt be both. A
man might be an atheist, a Protestant
or a Catholic, either one, but be cannot
be either two of these.
The Germans made their first advan
ces on Verdun by kilometers. Now they
are winning by meters only—but they
are still kill-o-meters.

ROOSEVELT'S PERSONAM|\Y.
The personality of Col. Roosevtlt i'i|
one of the remarkable things of the tore
sent generation. Mo man in recent yeafff
has made a greater impression on the
American people. While he has occttpU
ed the high office of president and is novf
an "ex" neither of these facts have any
thing special to do with him as a person.
His personality impresses both friend or
foe. To republicans, democrats or inde
pendents Mr. Rooeevelt is a somebody
and a somebody that oannot be ignoied
by anybody. Once Mr. Bryan bad a
personal following that was perhaps as
great or even greater in numbers thai|
that ot Mr. Roosevelt, but there is now
n^ comparison between these two men
as persons of influence, and power.
President Wilson to-day has a strong
following based on bis position, and per
sonal character. But a large part of the
friendship for him is political only. He
has never yet shown any special person^
ality. There is not much, if any, ofj
what we call personal magnetism aboutj
the Colonel. His distinguishing charac-.
teristic is a sort of d} namic force. He i#
a big man who is always doing and say-,
ing something. He is too big to be
ignored by either friend or foe. But
CoL. Roosevelt is not a popular man in
the ordinary sense. There is admiration
amounting to almost awe for bis rugged
strength. The spectator looks and fears
with almost the same feelings as when a
great mogul engine passes near him on
the tracks and shakes the whole earth'
and it is because Col Roosevelt is a man
of this sort, *e say as we said in .the be
ginning, his personality is one of the
most remarkable things of this genera
tion.
The Senior Play.
The annual high school play will be
given by the senior class on Thursday
evening June 1st at the City Hall. This
annual event is the senior class "classic"
of Pembina High School.
The seniors look forward to this event
with keen interest. To them only ooe
school event is greater and that of course
is commencement day. The people of
Pembina have been liberal in their pat
ronage of the annual play. We have al
ways tried to give you the very best of
which we were capable. That is our
motto for this year, wo have selected the
best play we could find for the cast of
characters. It is entitled "As a Woman
Thinketh." The play has a splendid
moral but lots of fun with plenty of ac
tion. Buy a ticket and come and spend
the evening with the seniors. Every
cent above expenses will be used by the
claps in the purchase of some improve
ment for the high school. Tickets are
50 cents each and will be on sale at the
Drug Store on Saturday morning May
27th. Get your seats reserved early.

STATE TBACK MEET.
The Pembina boys did very well at
the state track meet last Saturday,
the five boys winning four gold medals
and four silver medals besides one bronze
medal. Ryan Booker won the mile raoe
and the half mile. In the half mile be
broke the state record and in both races
led the ffeld by a good margin. The.
new rccord set in the half mile was 2
min. 92 5 seconds.
Robert Wardwell won first in the pole
vault also breaking the state record by
going 10 ft. 8 inches. He won first
without breaking the record but just to
show his opponents that be had not been
pushed very hard he requested the offi
cials to place the bar six or eight inches
higher which they did. He also won
2nd place in both hurdle races loosing
first place in the low hurdles by only a
few inches.
Eugene Ryan won 1st. place in the
quarter mile run easily defeating the
craok quarter miler, Durner, from Fargo,
Ralph Heneman won second in the n.ile

three stars all graduate this year and we
shall miss them very much but they will
be helped over many difficulties for they
have learned that success comes by per
feeverence and determination. In con
clusion the writer wishes to state that
he enjoys immensely seeing young people
Win through sterling qualities and the
satisfaction that came to him last Satur
day as the Pembina boys proved their
real worth will remain throughout the
years. He shall many years from now
see Robert Wardwell vaulting skyward
.Ryan Booker leaving his competitors
stringing along far behind as he sprints
down the finish in the mile and half-mile
with that eternal pleasant smile, as he
looks over his shoulder and seems to in

Ryan with those symmetrical and
wonderfully fast legs of his as he smil
ingly passes the leading competitor who
bad such high hopes of breaking the
tape himself.

County Track Meet.
In giving a brief account two weeks
ago in the Pioneer Express of the county
track meet at Walhalla, the writer neg
lected to mention the efficiency and hos
pitality of Walhalla in holding the meet.
Much credit is due Supt. McCullough
for the success of the meet. Everything
was in readiness for Jthe prompt begin
ning of the preliminaries at the appoint
ed time. This necissiated a lot of work
upon the part of Supt. McCullough pre
vious to the meet. The people of Wal
halla furnished dinner and supper to all
contestants and superintendents free.
For this hospitality as chairman of the
committee in behalf of the schools of the
county, the writer wishes to thank this
beautiful little city at the base of the
Pembina mountains.
Items have appeared in the papers
stating that unsportsmanlike ireuii.t-uc
was teceived upon the grounds as report
ed by Pembina. This was no reflection
upon Walhalla in any way but probably
refered to the incidence in which one of
the Pembina boys was disqualified in a
race through no fault of his own. Also
in two or three races the Pembina boys
were dissatisfied with the judges de
cisions. Now it is very evident that a
boy cannot run in a race and be his own
judge especially when said race is closely
contested. The writer believes the
judges did their best to be fair in all
Cases.
The best way to run our county meets
would be to have a complete set of out'
side officials who would enforce the rules
as they do at the state meet. But as we
have no fund to hire these officials we
have to run the meet as best we could
and it is true that considerable friction
and ill feeling developes among the boys
at our county meet but the writer sin
cerely hopes that it is not permanent
but quickly forgotten when the excite
ment and heat of the fray is passed. In
conclusion the writer wishes to go on
record as strongly recommending a com
plete set of outside officials to run our
county meet if we can possibly plan some
methot whereby we can meet the ex
penses.

Very Sincerely,
CHAS. D. CURTIS,
Chairman of Committee.
