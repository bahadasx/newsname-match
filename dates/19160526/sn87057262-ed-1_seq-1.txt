had their fire returned hy the engi

FRANCE
PARIS, May 26.—French troops re
pulsed German attacks on the west
bank of the Meuse, northwest of Ver
dun In last night's fighting and made
gains on the east bank, the war office
announced today.
By a smashing counter attack, the
French recaptured the trench lost yes
terday near Thiaumont farm, east ii
the Meuse. Near the farm the French
advanced by a grenade attack.
West of the river, the Germans con
tinued to rake the whole French front,
especially around Dead Man's hill
and near Ave court with the most
violent fire. The German* attempted
an Infantry attack which was cut
short by curtain fire from the French
guns.
For thirty-six hours there has been
no cessation In the cannonading
around Hill 304 and Avocourt. The
German artillery attack here is be
lieved to be the prelude to an at
tempt to storm Hill 304 and capture
the Avocourt positions, bringing the
Gerfans closer to the St. Menehould
railway, leading eastward to Verdun.
Further gains by the Germans on
both banka of the Meuse has aroused
the French capital to the seriousness
of the situation at Verdun. No anxiety
la felt here. Even should the French
be forced eventually to evacuate the
fortress because of the continued ad
vance of the crown prince's right
wing, there would be no alarm in
Paris. But it Is realized that the Ger
mans this week have concentrated
their forces In the heaviest strokes
yet delivered against tho oitadel.
So terrific has been the infantry
struggle waged on-all sectors of Ver
dun this week, that It is impossible
to make accurate estimates cf the
losses. How many uncounted dead
and wounded lie ot« the.slopes of
Dead Man's hill and in the gullies
and woods near Douaumont fort will
not be known until the artillery tem

fcEWEWAL OF BATTLE.
LONDON, May 28.—Violent artil

renewal of the pitched battle between
two great'armies around Verdun were
reported In dispatches from Paris
and Berlin this afternoon.
The lull In Infantry fighting since
early yesterday, coupled with- heavy
cannonading la believed to indicate a
At times grinning, at times serious,
Dr. Waite told the story. He would
smile with pleasure when searching
his memory, he could reveal to the
Jury a point he had forgotten. The
salient points revealed In his confes
sion from the witness stand are:
That he did not, nor does not know
whether he loved Clara Peck.
He made her love him because her
parents were wealthy.
The Idea of the poisoning came to
him as soon as he met Clara after his
return from South Africa in 1914.
He administered germs to the
wealthy Miss Katherine Peck before
his marriage to Clara. The germs
were given her In gifts of food
dainties.
After the marriage, when Mrs. John
E. Peck, his mother-in-law, arrived
here, he was ready for her and
started the germ administration at
once, daily slipping deadly disease
bacilli into her milk, cofTee and all
other food at which he had a chance.
When she diejjU he got ready for
John El Peck.
Ftor a long time he gave Peck
disease germs in a vain attempt to
kill him.
He sprinkled Peck's bed sheets
with water, hoping ha would catch

NEJW YORK, May 26.—His un
precedented story of murder and at
tempted murder told, Dr. Arthur War
ren Watte will today face cross ex
amination in his trial for the poison
ing of his millionaire father-in-law,
John B. Peck of Grand Rapids.
The smiling defendant, who in a five
hoors direct examination told of two
murders and a vain attempt at a
third, stands today the most remark
able criminalist. His story utterly
amazes men who have for years been
listening to stories of hardened
wretches told in their hours of re
morse.
His boyishness, his charming man
ner, persisted through his story. He
confessed his murders without a tre
mor, but shrunk and blushed and
hung his head when he found it neces
sary to uter a vile world.
Greed, he told was the motive for
the crimes.
It came out In two questions:
"Why did you administer germs and
poison to the Peckp?" he was asked.
"I wanted them to die."
"Why did you want them to die?"
"I wanted their money."

Finally despairing of the subtle

Amazing Story Resumed.
NEW YORK, Hay 26.—Calm admis
sion that he had planned to kill his
wife as well as her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. John B. Peck, of Grand Rapids,
and Miss Catherine Peck, her aunt,
was made on the witness stand to
day by Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
when he resumed his amazing story
of the arch poison plot through which
he hoped to gain the Peck millions.
Waite denied that he attempted to
kill Mrs. Waite, but said he had con
sidered it.
Asked the flat question, "are you
crazy?" on cross examination, Waite
replied:
"I think not."

[By Carl W. Aokerman, United Press

BERLIN, May 26.—President Wil
son should make no attempt to Inter
vone in the European war at present,
two well Informed neutral ambassa
dors told the United Press today.
Peace this summer Is Impossible,
they agreed. Recent exchanges be
tween the belligerent capitals and
confidential information obtained
through diplomatic channels, con
vinces them that each side is too con
fident of Its ability to win the mili
tary victories this summer to listen to
peace proposals.
One ambassador said he thought
fighting would cease In October, ap
parently basing his opinion on the
conviction that this summer's fighting
will only emphasize* the deadlock.
Peace negotiations, he suggested
would then be carried on throughout
the winter, taking at least a year for
their conclusion.

Mrs. Horton and the "man from
Egypt" figured in Waite's testimony
when the cross examination was tak
en up.
"Do you remember teHLr.i Detec

your wife to find out about Mrs. Hor
ton?"
Waite admitted writing about Mrs.
Horton from Bellevue.
"And you were faking Insanity at
Bellevue?"
"I was not."
"Did you conspire with others in
the Tombs to get up an insanity de
fense?"
"I did not."
"Did you mention the man from
Egypt while at Bellevue?"
"No, not at Bellevue, but I did else
where."
"You confessed yesterday that you
have been a llax and a ihief all of
your life. What assurance have we
that yon are telling the truth now?"
An objection to this was sustained.
When Brothers asked Waite If he
expected to get a couple of million
dollars after the death of Peck, the
dapper young dentist replied that he
did not expect "that much." He
said he planned to leave the city, but
denied that he Intended going away
with Mrs. Horton,

queried Brothers.
"I have never denied it."
"What is your defense?"*
"1 am making no defense."
Waite reiterated that he did not
know whether he loved Clara Peck.
"And you placed arsenic in Mr.
Peck's month with the intent that he
should die?"
"I did."
Here Justice Shearn took up the
questioning cut the prisoner.

"I did."

to murder?"
