Try to End Strike by
Golden Rule Methods
(By The Som News Service.)
Chicago, May 25.-Killing
strikes by kindness is a pro
gram that commends itself to
the Western Gas Construction
Company, of Fort Wayne,
Ind.
The company emphasized its
faith in gentle methods when
it provided chairs for striking
machinists who are picketing
the plant, invited them indoors
when ;t rained, and showered
them with small attentions.
The construction firm's policy
toward the strikers is believed
to establish A precedent in
labor t-oiles.
Twentv-five union machin
ists-about half of those em
ploved by the company-went
on strike last Friday. Their
principal grievance was said
to be in connection with re
lations between workers rather
than with wages.

en Antonio. Texas. May 25.-Gen.
Funston today made a sudden switch
of plans andi will send the Fourth Texas
Infantry into the Big Bend region in
stead of the Eagle Pass district.
It is evident that the approach of

cause of this change.
The former National Guard regiment
will garrison Presidio, Lajitas, and other
towns of the Big Bend.
Gen. Funston received instructions
from Washington to appoint members of
a coutrt martial to try the 116i Texas Na
