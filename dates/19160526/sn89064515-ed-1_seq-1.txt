Six girls from Morrison county and
one former Little Falls girl whose
home now is in North Dakota are
among the list of students who will
graduate from the St. Cloud normal
school this spring. Thev are Misses
Marian J. Davis, Gunda Goodmanson,
Hildegarde Kleber and Gladys War
ren of this city, Misses Ellen M. Pet
titt and Lillie A. Walters of Royalton
and Miss Rose M. Zaloudek, formerly
of Little Falls, but whose home now

Will GET BULL MOOSE
YOUNG ANIMAL WILL BE PRO
CURED FROM NORTHERN
TRAPPER IN SHORT TIME
A young bull moose will be added to
the collection of animals at the Pine
Grove park within the next two
-weeks, according to plans now under
•way whereby one will be secured from
Warroad. Local parties have been cor
responding with a trapper living at
Warroad ior some time and he has
agreed to catch a young bull moose
for them. He
#says
that the animal
must be caught the first of June so
the committee -will take immediate
action in the matter.
Part of the cost of getting the
moose will be paid by the Moose
lodge, they having raised some money
"by giving dances, etc., for that pur
pose. The balance will be raised by
popular subscription. The trapper,
Joe Crowett, wants $75 for capturing
the moose, and the cost of transpor
tation will probably bring the total
cost to about $100. The city council
•will be asked at its next meeting to
furnish feed for the moose. It will
also be necessary for the city to get a
permit from the state game warden to
keep the moose.
SCHOOL VERY
EXHIBITS WERE
GOOD
A number of people visited the high
school and Central yesterday after
noon to see the exhibits of work done
during the past year in the schools.
The exhibits were certainly splendid
and a credit to the students and to the
instructors. It would be hard to say
that any one exhibit was better than
the other but the results were proba
bly more plain in the domestic science
A. Wright, who is employed at the
saw mill here, had his right arm brok
en Wednesday when it was struck by
a belt from a machine on which he was
•working.

from a small specimen of patching to
the very finest party gown. The chro
c-heting was especially good. In the
manual training department were ex
hibits of library tables, cedar chests,
book racks, gymnasium paraphernalia,
various kinds of stands, etc. One
piano bench was an especially fine
piece of work. The exhibits of pen
manship and mechanical drawing were
also very good. As a whole the exhi b

THE THREE PROPOSED ROUTES—
NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE
TO GO OVER THEM
Below we are printing a statement
on the routing of the Jefferson High
way. While tne Long Prairie route is
not mentioned it is said that it will
also be inspected. The Mille Lacs
Leech Lake route people have named
P. H. McGary of Walker as their rep
resentative to cover the route. J. S.
Scribner of Walker has been named as
alternate. The statement follows:
St. Paul, Minn., May 18. 1916.
Dear Sir:
In re the routing of the Jefferson High
way from St. Paul to Winnipeg. We are
directed to issue the following state
ment:
Mr. J. D. Clarkson, general manager of
the Jefferson Highway association,
reached St. Paul today, enroute to Win
nipeg. Mr. Clarkson, during the past
month, has visited the principal towns
on the Jefferson Highway from New Or
leans to St. Paul. The local directors
of the Jefferson Highway association
have been awaiting the arrival of Mr.
Clarkson for a conference with him rel
ative to the routing of this highway
northwesterly from St. Paul to the Ca
nadian boundary.
At a conference held today in the office
of the Highway Commission, participat
ed in by Geo. E. Cooley, chief engineer,
and J. M. Mullen, assistant engineer of
the State Highway Commission, J. D.
Clarkson, general manager of the Jeffer
son Highway, Henry H. Orme and J. H.
Beek, directors of the Jefferson High
way association, the following proposed
routes were considered:
1. A route embracing the following
towns, hereafter referred to as the West
ern route: St. Paul, Minneapolis, Anoka,
Elk River, St. Cloud, Melrose, Sauk Cen
tre, Osakis, Alexandria, Henning, Per
ham, Detroit, Lake Park, Moorhead,
Crookston, Warren, Steven, Hallock,
boundary line.
2. Another route embracing the fol
lowing towns, hereafter called the Cen
tral route: St. Paul, Minneapolis, Elk
River, St. Cloud, Little Falls, Staples,
Wadena, Park Rapids, Itasca Park, Be
midji, Bagley, Red Lake Lalls, Thief
River Falls, thence to the boundary line
at St. Vincent.
3. A .route embracing the following
towns, hereafter to be called the Eastern
route: St. Paul, Minneapolis, Anoka, Elk
River, Princeton, Mille Lacs Lake, skirt
ing the westerly shore of Mille Lacs lake
to Garrison, thence westerly to Brainerd,
Pine River, Walker, Cass Lake, Bemidji,
thence the same as the Central route
northwesterly to the boundary line.
It was arranged for Mr. Clarkson to
make a personal tour of inspection over
each of the three proposed routes at
some date in the near future, the date to
be definitely announced within a few
days.
In order that each proposed route may
know that it has had absolutely fair
treatment, it is proposed than an official
representative of each of the three
routes accompany Mr. Clarkson on his
inspection trip the representatives of
the contesting routes to be guests of the
representative of the particular route
under inspection. In this way the rep
resentative of each route wil see for him
self all that is shown Mr. Clarkson and
will hear all that is said in favor of the
particular route under inspection.
iaccompany
inspect
on tr
iP the representatives
Mr. Clarkson will be accompanied on
his inspection trip by H. H. Orme, a
director of the Jefferson Highway asso
ciation and president of the State Auto
mobile -associations and ^piassibiy-^-othar:
directors will arrange to accompany him.
The order in which the three routes
will be inspected is to be determined by
lot cast by the three official representa
tives of the contesting routes.
The representatives of the three routes
will be required to agree in writing that
they will accept the decision, when ren
dered. as final and binding upon them
and the routes they represent.
It is the earnest desire of the Highway
Commission, as well as the directors of
the Jefferson Highway, that the route
selected will be of the greatest value to
the state and to the traveling public wno
will use this great north and south inter
national highway and they desire to
make the selection in such a way that
there will be no ground to question the
judgment and fairness of those responsi
ble for the selection and to this end the
greatest possible publicity will be given
to the inspection trip and the utmost op
portunity afforded the advocates of each
route to present their advantages..
To assist in reaching a correct con
clusion, each route will be scored upon
the number of definite points, among
wThich will be:
1. Wealth and population of the terri
tory traversed by the highway.
2. Hotel and garage accommodations.
3. Present condition of roads, wheth
er improved or unimproved.
4. Total mileage of each route.
5. Soil condition as affecting road con
struction: topography of the country as
affecting grades and availability of road
building material suitable for construc
tion of 365-day roads.
6. Scenic advantages and points of es
pecial interest.
The officers and directors of the Jef
ferson Highway feel that the association
is in a sense responsible to the tourists
which the highway attracts, and in the
discharge of their duty in adopting a
route, they must not be influenced
wholly by local considerations, but they
must keep in mind the greatest good to
the greatest number. Even what may be
best for the State of Minnesota is not
altogether controlling, since all of the
states upon the highway have an inter
est in the selection of the route in each
of the other states, in order that the
entire highway, from New Orleans to
Winnipeg may be the very best possible.
We suggest that those interested put
their respective routes in the best possi
ble shape. As Minnesota directors, we
are extremely anxious that each route
make the best showing possible.
We suggest also that each .route elect
its official representative who will ac
company Mr. Clarkson over all three
routes, and send their names and ad
dresses to the undersigned. It .should not
be understood that the attendance will
be limited to the one representative. The
one elected will be the official represen
tative, and he will ride with Mr. Clark
son and the representative of the other
routes. A dozen others may be along if
thev wish, but they must provide their
own cars, and look out for their own
accommodations.
We believe this plan of disposing of
the present contests is absolutely fair
and ought to prove satisfactory to all.
Tour very truly,
—J. H. BEEK,
Vice Pres. for Minn.
—HENRY H. ORME.
Director.
The Transcript office and the east
half of the Golden Rule store will have
new plate glass fronts installed soon.

at the hospital from apoplexy, from
which she suffered a sudden stroke.

previous to her death she complained
of palpitation of the heart and was
given treatment for it and since had
said nothing about it. On her way
home from the train Saturday evening
she told her sister, Mrs. Hall, that she
had been examined while in St. Paul

an internal goitre, and that this was
causing the high blood pressure.
