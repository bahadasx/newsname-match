Comes to Abingdon and Makes
Great Address on European
War?Is Not For I'eaee at
Any Price, He Says.
Mr. Bryan made an address at Ab?
ingdon on the 24th to about 5000 peo?
ple. He spoke at the Fair grounds.
The day was line and a great crowd
was present, and, as usual, he made
an address which caught the crowd.
The address was divided into three
parts. First, the cause of the great
war; second, tho mistaken philoso?
phy of all wars, and, third, the way
to permanent peace.
He was introduced by Ex-Governor
J. H?ge Tyler, in a brief address.
The speech of Mr. Bryan was
against militarism. He is not for
''peace at any price." Ho said:
"There have been righteous wars in
the past and may be righteous wars
in the future, and if there is ever a
war against the United States every?
one of the citizens will gladly shed
every drop of his blood in her de?
fense."
Five automobiles out of Tazewell,
filled with people attended the speak?
ing, which began at 4 p. m. and end?
ed at G.
The Tazewell people reached home
flit various times during the night and
early morning.
Brother John Keesee's Ford broke
down on the mountain, and was over?
taken by Jo. Heldreth's Hun. and pull?
ed to the top, where it drifted down,
and was finally fixed up, and Mrs.
Keesee got home in time to get break?
fast and feed the chickens.' The en?
tire crowd had a fine time and en?
joyed the trip hugely and are more
appreciative of tho gifts of head and
heart of the Great Commoner.
FARM NOTES.
(By J. L. Montague.) '
Alfalfa.
Can alfalfa be successfully grown
in this county'.' This is a question '
in tho minds of many farmers. AI- 1
falfa will grow on some farms in 1
Tazewell, and on some farms it will '
not. It depends on the land and the 1
man. There are more than a dozen '
of those who have demonstrated that ;
many of our soils can be adapted to
this valuable forage plant. !
The best way to become acquainted '
with alfalfa is to sow a small patch i
having first eliminated every possi- <
ble chance of failure. A few causes '
of failure are: Bad location, lack of
sufficient line and plant food, weeds,
late seeding and failure to inoculate.
These conditions can be avoided by
applying lime, manure and fertili?
zers; killing weeds before sowing by
thorough tillage; and inoculating. In- j
oculation is accomplished in three ,
ways: 1st, by mixing alfalfa seed ,
with clover, and depending on volun- [
teer plants to inoculate the soil. 2nd, ,
by sowing dirt from an inoculated al- ,
falfa field. These bacteria cultures
are furnished by the government free j
and some seed houses furnish them. ,
If everything else is done to secure t
a stand of alfalfa, and the inocula- ,
tion left off, your work may prove a
failure. (
All the alfalfa that was sown in ,
corn last fall froze out badly. Gooil
stands have been secured in this way, ,
but it is safer to seed alone. I would
rather sow alfalfa in corn stubble
land in the spring, than to run the
risk of winter killing by sowing at
the last cultivation of corn. I have
not seen a single instance in this (
county where alfalfa seeded alone be- i
fore the 15th of August last was in- i
jured by freezing, and last winter ,
was unusually severe. I
If you intend sowing alfalfa this .
summer it will pay you to consider ,
the following points:
1. Select a rich, well drained soil.
2. Use ground limestone or burnt
lime.
3. Uso acid phosphate and clean
manure.
4. Plow nt least a month before
seeding, and harrow every time the
weeds start to grow.
5. Between July 30th and August
15th, sow nt least 20 pounds of seed,
freo of weeds.
6. Inoculate.

IMPORTANT NOTICE.
Any width of a pubic road, less than
thirty feet, must be sustained by the
county records, otherwise the width
ol the right of way of our county
roads, is not less than thirty feet.
Fences on this righ; of way, un?
der our recently amended roau laws,
are obsti ucnons, and as such are sub?
ject to removal or to be set back, un?
der penalty, on three days notice from
iho County Road Department.
Whiie very evident that such an ar?
bitrary move would inttict considera?
ble pecuniary loss and inconvenience
upon our people, and might be from
many Standpoints, most inadvisable,
nevertheless it is not to bo inferreu
that the county through inactivity in
this respect, resigns the prerogative
uf removing at any time any or all
fences obstructing the right of way.
I would earnestly request, there?
fore, in order to meet the require?
ments of the law, as it behooves ev?
ery citizen, that you kindly co-oper
iite with your road department in sup?
porting the legal statute, by hereaf?
ter, and from this date, when con?
structing new fences or repairing am.
replacing the old along the public
road, set the same on ttie line of the
right of way. If in doubt as to saio
line, advise the road department,
which will render immediate advice or
service.
All fences constructed or renewed
subsequent to this notice, and built
in the public right of way, will be re?
garded as obstructions, and the prop- i
ir action for the removal thereof will I
je taken as the law directs.

MISS CROCKETT'S MUSIC RE?
CITAL.
Last Saturday evening at H o'clock
Miss Bessie Crockett's music class
gave a delightful recital in the High
School chapel.. By a mnlndvortance
it was not announced in either of the
town papers that the recital would
take place at that time, but, not?
withstanding that fact the auditorium
of the chapel was Idled to the doors
with patrons and friends In commence?
ment mood.
The singe was beautifully decorat?
ed, the scheme giving the effect of a
woodland scene where vines and dow?
ering boughs intertwine. The class of '
twenty-eight young ladies was ranged
in semi-circle under this vivid canopy
and between the festooned wings, ii
very beautiful setting indeed for a ?
musical entertainment.
The program was necessarily a long
one, but not at any time uninterest
in, the variety and excellence of the
young ladies conspiring to hold and
entertain the audience until the re- 1
citjil was over.
The playing of the entire class was '
uniformly excellent, several of the
young ladies displaying a high order
of musical talent.
Miss Crockett evidently has the
unusual and happy faculty of arousing
and sustaining nthusinsm in her pu
uils, and she not only leads them suc?
cessfully through the technical diffi?
culties of her art, hut inspires in
them a sense of harmony that mani?
fests itself in what is known as i
"touch."

General Association in Asheville
Eliminates Many Useless Sec?
retaries and Consolidates
Mission Hoards.
The Soulhern Baptist convention,
hi'lil nt Ashville, N. C, closing on
last Sunday, look decided stops in
the way ol retrenchment and a re?
duction of expenses. Two newspapers,
covering the same mission Held, were
consolidated. Several traveling ami
Held secretaries were discontinued and
a move set on fool to consolidate sev?
eral id" the mission boards of the con?
vention. A northern Melhodits gen?
eral conference took similar notion a
few weeks ngp at the annual meet?
ing.
It has been claimed for several 1
years that the work of the denomina-.
tions was conducted at an unneecs-'
sary largo expense. There ban been
too many boards, too many secreta?
ries, et cetera, all covering identical
territory, ami doing practically the
same work, and practically doubling
tho OXpenseH. "it. costs loo much to
gel. (hero with the dollar I give," says
one. "By the lime my dollar gels to
tho place it looks like thirty cents."
And so, (hero is a spirit of reform
among all the churches. On the for?
eign held this step is of greal mo?
ment and importance.
Consolidation of Churches and De?
nominations.
It is predicted, that in the course
of time, there will be a consolidation
id' churches, and perhaps of denomi?
nations as well. Tho rank and file,
the proletariat, will some dny rise up
and demand that the wasting of mon?
ey bo slopped and the supporting of
two churches and two or more boards ?
and a number of men where a less
number, perhaps one, wotdd be suf?
ficient, shall be brought about. In I
tho retrenchment inaugurated by
the Baptist convention at Asheville ?
several men and few secretaries und
others, lost a job, but there seems
to have been no hesitation or opposi- '
lion on this account. One of (he chief
obstacles in (he path of the church
und denominational consolidation,
somebody says, is the question of
?jobs," "So many men would lose their
jobs,"

"Hut be would not. drink thereof;

Many readers of the story from I
vhich our text is taken have ever felt
hat David was wofully ungracious to
'the three mighty men" who snatched
or him a drink of water from the
veil of Bethlehem at. peril of their
ives. Here was Bethlehem in the
iamb; of the Philistines. Hero those
nen, when they beard that David was
anging for "water to drink of the well
if Bethlehem, which is by the gate,"
'brake through the camp of the Phil
slines" and drew water from this
.veil. And yet when these heroes
nought to the King tin- water which
.hey had purchased at. so great price
in "he would not drink it but poured
t out unto the Lord." What could
lave been more ungrateful than such
in act as this? How could David
lave more pointedly show . his con?
tempt for the three who hazarded
.heir lives for his sake'/ What must
lave, been the sensations of the three
When they saw the precious water
{pilled out upon the ground?
Such is our first impression as wo
peruse this slory. But if we study it
i little closer shall we not find that
David's act, so far from being an in?
sult to these servants of his pleas?
ure, was in reality the greatest trib?
ute which he could pay them? Gould
lie take this gift which had been won
it the peril of the lives of three good
men? Gould ho use, for the gratifi?
cation of his own selfish and whimsi?
cal desires, what his fellow had well
nigh perished to obtain? Nay, to
[Irink this water would be to drink,
not water merely, but the blood of
men. From the heart of love, not from
the well of Bethlehem, came this prec?
ious fluid.
Thus did David consecrate what
came to him through the work of
men's hands and at the peril of mens
lives. Why do we not do the same?
The wealth which we accumulato is
bought by tho sweat and tears of
myriads of toilers, yet we use it for
the vanities and luxuries of idle fan?
cy. Our knowledge is the gift of
hundreds of faithful scholars who
gave and dared all to find the truth,
yet we take it as a medium of selfish
culture and not of efficient service.
Our political freedom is the boon
transmitted by men who bled on bnt
tle fields, yet we snatch it with igno
blo greed as an opportunity for plun?
der, power end -If. Our nliirious
liberty is living water snatched from
wellsprings of the spirit, belcagurcd
by Philistines of every age and place,
by an unbroken line of martyred
prophets from Jesus to Theodore
Parker, yet we nccept it as a chance
for lazy indifference to nil tho high?
er and nobler things of life. The
very world we inhabit is tho free of-1
ferine; of the creative love of AI-1
?nighty God, yet we use it as a play?
ground, a battle field or a pig trough.
What do we possess, from the com?
monest material object to the rarest
spiritual faculty, which hns not been
bought nt some incalculable price?
1 And what, therefore, do we possess
which can rightly be used for our?
selves and not. for God?
