to submit all international
disputes to arbitration and establishment
.of a joint police force to
guarantee that no nation will

Former President Taft made!
the principal speech this after-1
nixin. This dealt with an explanation
of why the constitutional
authority of the President
and Congress to declare war
would not be violated by the
league's plan.
Bripf T?eforonep to Pvocant
.Speakers referred only incidentally
to methods of ending the present war,
f nee tlie league's program includes

over questions which might he adjudicated

urged that the United States become a
party to the suggested agreement.

be abolished, but it would he curtailed,

combat only if the court's decree
were not accepted by any nation.

|
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
j CHICAGO. May 26.?Here are the lines
of strategy in the republican presidential
situation as they exist today: ^
Kirst. Col. Roosevelt is intent upon pre- Qy
venting the nomination of Mr. Justice .
Hughes on an early ballot and to destroy
the Hughes suggested candidacy if he \\
can. He is obsessed of the idea that he ^
himself is the only man who can surely
defeat President Wilson. V
Second. The favorite sons, the progressives
claim, are playing directly into the '
colonel's hands by combining to withhold I
a commanding lead from Mr. Hughes. The \y
colonel's managers here know that every
succeeding vote after the second ballot (>
j will facilitate the dislntergation of the
j favorite sons' strength, delegates dividj
ing between Hughes and Roosevelt. m
! Third. The favorite sons are at a com- S
| plete standstill awaiting a showdown of at
1 the Hughes strength. I'ntil Mr. Huchps
i has been disposed of in some way they
cannot turn a wheel.
th
In Precarious Position. .it
The managers of the favorite sons at
know that their- position is very precarious.
It hangs by a hair trigger. Ju
Granted that they develop a combined
vote which will constitute a majority, "1
thus shutting out Roosevelt and to
Hughes, they realize full well the difficulty
of holding that vote for any ar
length of time. w
Say that candidate A has 200 votes in 0'
sight, scattered among various state
{ delegations. They are not pledged
, votes. They are favorable votes, friendi
ly votes. But they are not wedded to a
i candidate forever and for aye. There ai
j are Hughes votes among them, and
votes for candidates B. C and D, as a ar
second c hoice, and it will not be a vio- at
lent supposition to presume that some er
of them would be glad to go to Roosevelt.
In other words, a candidate can poll ju
these friendly votes for himself, but o*
he cannot "deliver" them to another. w
And this fact constitutes the inherent af
and fatal defect in the combination of 0f
the favorite sons. Col. Roosevelt f0
knows it, his managers know it, and
chuckle as they realize it.
1 vv
Swift Changes Possible. 0f
Thf foregoing is the layout today.
It doubtless will Change fromiftntlu -
j and swiftly, for nevor was there a r,f
i political situation so charged with
i contingencies and possibilities as the 0f
; one in which the republican party now w
finds itself. lr
The contest is on and wide open.
Every candidate has his headquarters
going full blast this morning, with
managers and lieutenants busy as nail- xv'
ers. tl
There are no Hughes headquarters, ai
because Mr Hughes is not a candidate.
Nobody pays any attention to the
claims of the managers or to the "dope"
the\ hand out. If all the claims were tl
verifier! the convention would have to tc
consist of about 1,500 delegates in- d:
stead of 985. tl
For the moment the activities of the H
progressives and their plans absorb at- if
tention. You must understand at the d<
outset that the heart and the core of tp
the progressive position is support of g
Roosevelt's stand on Americanism, pre- ji
paredness and the "hyphenates," using sr
that word as a short ctH. to description
and not offensively. a
This position was stated at length in
detail and with characteristic vehemence
by the colonel in his recent Detroit
speech.
si
Backbone of Progressive Platform.
That is the backbone of the progressive
platform, and those who are not ct
for it. as the colonel laid it out, are ,n
against. There is no middle road for *1
the progressives on this subject. tl
Very well. The first thing the pro1
gressives are doing is to charge that oi
| Mr. Justice Hughes is opposed to this in
j attitude. Th*> are sending out in large m
I quantities quotations from the New ^
York Times' editorial of a few days ff
ago. which charged outright that Mr. jr
Hughes answered the description of the f(
men criticised by the colonel as being
uncertain upon this platform of pri- pi
mary demand by the progressives. a,
Then they go on to say that the w
progressives will not support any man 0
whose position is not definitely de- p,
fined on this subject and which does
not measure up to progressive de- ^
mands. This course of campaigning ^
is the progressive forty-eight-centimej
ter gun in their attack to shell Hughes ai
| out of the trenches before beginning j,
| their drive on the stronghold of the
i regular republicans. It is said?and
j when I use an expression of this kind
I do not imply vague talk, but state
'the concentrated judgment of men in i ?
{ large leadership who know w hat is
i what? that if the convention rung ?
j a w a v and nominates^!r. Hughes w ith- j 01
out an acrimonious contest. Col. Roosevelt I jr
will support hint, as will most of his j
progressives, provided, of course, the jC1
Dint form is acceptable.
1 It furthermore is said th* profjres- li
| s i vfs, if Root is nominated by the reg- Jai
: ulars. will nominate a third ticket. not j p
i necessarily the colonel. For at present jo:
it is not in the cards that the colonel it
wants to try another bolt. J f?
Roosevelt Attitude. | "
t<
It is said that the colonel does not 1 r<
favor Hurton, and that his progressives it
do not like Fairbanks. Also that they J
are dubious of some other of the favor- jn
ite sons. Whom, then, will the colonel f I
favor if Mr. Hughes is riot coinmandeered
to run .' Do you think the colonel
knows himself? Right here I would n
like to interject a word about a grow- ii
, ing feeling among regular republicans, y
getting this from old-line leaders It b
will be timel>. for, after all, this is
their convention: v
i That is. that there is increasing senti- t
merit among the regulars that tlsey f
would lather take a candidate and a t
platform true to republican ideals and t
standards and go to defeat with them, c
than to give up every vestige of repub- p
lican individuality and go into the race
with a patchwork platform of radicalism
suggested by a minority faction of
their party.
They say that on the one hand they n
' would have four more years of obscur- j
ity, but would emerge with a party intart
and strengthened, while on the J
other hand the republican party would _
disappear as a political entity.

This Afternoon.
OVERNMENT STANDS ON
INDIVIDUAL INDICTMENTS
bandons Effort to Convict on Joint
Bill Against Glover and
Flathers.
?
An important development in
le trial of past and present
hggs National Rank officials aclsed
of perjury in swearing that
te hank did not deal in stocks
as the fact that the government
>day abandoned efforts to eotiict
on the joint indictment i
gainst Mr. Glover and the
lessrs. ! lathers. The governlent
'"elected" to go to the jury
11 the individual indictments.
The case is expected to he in the
ry's haiuls by tomor row. An agi eeent
was made this morning: that coun1
for both sides should have two
id a half hours each for argument be re
the jury, and that court should
t this evening until 6 o'clock. Under
lis arrangement it wag expected that
jstice Siddons would charge the jury
10 o'clock tomorrow morning, thus
jtting the case in the hands of the
iry tomorrow forenoon. But so much
me has been taken up today with
lair splitting" discussions over the
rmal prayers to the court that a
lay has developed in this schedule,
id the opening arguments to the jury,
hich were to have begun today at I
clock, did not begin until later.
District Attorney Opens. ^
District Attorney Uaskey opened the ^
gument to the jury this afternoon ,
id he will be followed by Mr. Archer
id Mr. Fitts of counsel for the gov- th
ninent. The government will exercise Ol
s rights to close the arguments to the th
ry. George f\ Hoover and Daniel W.
Donoghue of counsel for the defense ?
ill each speak for half an hour this 111
ternoon. and John B. Stanchfleld. also
counsel for the defense, will speak .
r one hour and a half. Ill
Th*- defense believes that it has rn
nndd important points by two prayers
hich were granted by the court. One _
these is that the jury shall be in- ?
ructed "that the instructions given
em by the court are for their guid- T
ice and the applications of principles I
law to the facts as the jury may And I
ie?n. hut that the jury are the sole I
id exclusive judges of the credibility
witnesses and of the truth and
eight of all evidence given in the
ial."
Other Prayer of Defense.
The other prayer the defense
hich was granted today, and which
le defense believes highly important I r
j tending toward a favorable verdict,
as follows:
"If the jury finds from the evidence
lat the defendant honestly believed 4
> be true the statements in the affiavit
as he understood them and aulorized
its filing in that belief, then
leir verdict must he not guilty, even
they should also find from the evi- |V
ence that he was mistaken as to the
ue meaning and effect of the lanuage
used in the affidavit; and the
jiy must find that the defendant did
) honestly believe unless the evidence
itisfies them to the contrary beyond
reasonable doubt."
Motion to Dismiss Overruled.
When court convened this morning,
lortly after 10 o'clock, with the jury
ill absent from the room. Justice Sid>ns
announced that he had given very
ireful consideration overnight to the
otion of the defense that the case ^
lould he dismissed on the ground that . .
jere was want of evidence, and had
Iso carefully considered ihe arguments rc
r counsel on both sides. Without pausig
to express any opinions, he said, the
lotion to nismiss would be overruled. <it
An exception wax taken by the de?nse,
and Mr. O'Donoghue, for the de- **
?nse. moved the court to dismiss the .
>int indictment against the three de- I
mdants on the ground. he said, that jn
lere is no such crime in law as joint
erjury, pointing: out that the defendnts
swore separately to the affidavit
hich caused their indictment. The act b<
f perjury, he said, is individual and
ersonal. hj
Mr. Archer answered for the govern- .
lent, supported by Mr. Fitts. Cases *11
ere cited which proved, the govern- r
lent lawyers said, that there can be ^
rid have been instances of joint periry
and joint indictment therefor. ^
New Phase Develops.
It was at this point that there sud
enly developed the government's wilngnoss
to abandon efforts to convict
n the joint indictment, and almost
nmediately all the lawyers in the H
ts*> were on their feet.
Mr. Fitts started to say that he beeved
the government should "elect,''
b the technical phrase is. whether to
ress for a conviction on one or the
i her or both forms of indictment, and
soon was manifested that the de
;u?e wuui'i iiinim, -II in*: Kovonimem
sleeted' to abandon the joint indictient),
that the court instruct the jury
) ignore the joint indictment, and to
sturn a verdict of not guilty on that
idietment [
When Mr Laskey. the district at-|
orney. announced t it at the govern- i
lent would "elect to go td the jury on i
tie individual indictments," it seemed j
tint tlie government would nevethe- J
:?s fight the granting of 11?e defense's
notion to dismiss the joint indlctlent.
There was soon an understandig.
however, among counsel, and the
>int indictment will not be considered
y the jury.
At 11 o'clock a recess for an hour
t>as taken, to give the government at- I
orneys an opportunity to examine the
ormal prayers of the defense, of which
hey had just been furnished copies,
hey said. Befor this, however, the
ourt heard and ruled on the formal
rayers of the government attorneys.
Passes on Government Prayers,
Justice Siddons denied the government's
prayer that the jury should be
nstructed that "the language of the
.ftidavit set forth in the indictment is
road enough to include the purchase.

Through various channels Mr. Wilson
as kept in close touch with the devellimenr.
of peace prospects: It is under- !
tood he will convey a message to his
udience tomorrow night which is cer
tin to he read with deep interest by '
?presentativea of foreign governments
nd by the peoples of the warring nabns.
Open-Minded as to Time.
The President is understood to have '
n open mind on the question of just 5
hen he should renew formal offers of ,
tediation. i
Mr. Wilson's closest advisers believe 1
itt rulers of warring nations, because?.
f their close relationship, even kin- ! t
hip. will have as important a part in j
estoring peace as the ministers of ( t
leir governments. It will occasion no n
urprise in official circles if in some
tanner the rulers of the countries at i
ar open the way for peace conversa- I
ons. j ,
The President takes the position, it j
ras authoritatively stated, that the I
eutrals of the world, as much as bel- I
gerents, have a right to participate j
i, and if possible initiate, peace rtego- ;
iations because of the economic re-,
ults already developed and those which j
nil follow the conflict.
Growth of Peace Talk. !
The President has been deeply inerested
in the growth of peace talk
mong responsible officials in several
f the belligerent nations during the
ist three weeks.
He has read and filed away recent
peeches by President Poineare of '

ustom of arriving just in time for
