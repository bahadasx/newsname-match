is now before the senate. It proposes
to appropriate 150,000,000 to be
raised by Panama bonds for the pur
chase, charter or lease of ships by
the government, which would be sold
or leased to private capital as rapid

the late spring had delayed spawning
of the clams and that the season, as
a result, so far had been a failure.

VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE
GLOSIN6 WATERWAY
CITY'S PROPOSAL IS FOUGHT AT
HEARING BEFORE STATE
LAND COMMISSIONER.
State Land Commissioner Clark
V. Savidge has taken under advise
ment the petition presented by the
city of Olympia and by Senator P.
H. Carlyon in a hearing before him
last Tuesday, for the vacation of the
Des Chutes waterway, the construc-
tion of a dam in the river at Fourth
street and the creation of a lake
south of that street, so t hat the city
will not have to erect a drawbridge
on West Fourth street at an expense
of several thousand dollars more
than the cost of an ordinary bridge.
The city officials and Dr. Carlyon
are practically alone in their advo
cacy of the change, the town of Tum
water, the Olympia Brewing com
pany and the Olympia Light & Pow
er company protesting vigorously,
while Councilman Talcott also ob
jects and Governor Lister has since
stated that the capitol commission
has no interest in the proposal. Sav
idge's decision will probably be fi
nal, as the war department has ad
vised him it does not consider that
portion of the waterway navigable
and that if the state authorities de
cided to vacate it, the federal gov
ernment would probably take the
same course.
The city proposed that a dam with
a spillway outlet be constructed at
the Fourth street bridge, eight feet
below high tide, so that the new cap
itol grounds would overlook a lake
of a minimum depth of four feet at
low tide, and still permit the passage
of small boats and scows through
the waterway at high tide. Included
in the project is a change in the
Northern Pacific tracks so that they
would run straight across the bay.
A counter proposal has been made
that the city should construct a
bridge elevated 20 to 25 feet above
high tide and extended westward as
a viaduct over the old Port Town
send tracks until it joined the exist
ing grade of Fourth street part way
up the hill. This, it is argued,
would eliminate a dangerous grade
crossing, and remove the necessity of
the city building a drawbridge, while
It would also permit the passage of
itugs and scows.
In a hearing before Justice Crosby
Monday Mrs. Nellie Hinds of the Sto
ny Point school district was convicted
of the charge of violating the state
school laws by refusing to send her
children to school, and was fined $25
and $17.75 costs, sentence being sus
pended until next fall, when it will
be enforced if she still refuses to
comply with the law. The Stony
Point school has just closed its year's
w'ork. Some years ago Mrs. Hinds
.served a jail sentence for violating
the school laws, and was later tried
and acquitted of the charge of killing
her husband.
First Meeting of 8. A. R.
Claude B. Mann of Winlock was in
the city the latter part of last week
to attend the first regular meeting of
Robert Gray chapter, Sons of the
American Revolution, which was held
'at the residence of C. B. Mann last
Friday evening. A vocal solo by Rev.
'C. S. Morrison, accompanied by

Sign Petitions—Good
Program.
Despite the threatening weather
last Thursday morning, the day
chosen for a general registration by
the peopel of South Union precinct,
a goodly assemblage gathered to reg
ister and to sign the initiative peti
tions, which were on hand for that
purpose, and Mrs. Randall, the regis
tration clerk for the precinct, was
kept busy from early morning until
late in the afternoon adding new
names to the rolls.
A sumptuous dinner was served in
the church at noon, after which some
time was spent in singing patriotic
songs and other airs, and then Rev.
D. A. Thompson, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church of Olympia, gave
an interesting talk on "Direct Legis
lation," with special reference to the
prohibition movement He paid a
glowing tribute to woman's influence
in political matters. Mrs. A. E. Shel
don then made a few remarks regard
ing the possibilities of improving gen
eral conditions through the law-mak
ing power in the hands of the people.
"Taken as a whole, this first at
tempt to make a holiday of registra
tion," says one of those instrumen
tal in it, "may well be counted a com
plete success, socially, intellectually
and patriotically, and it is to be hoped
that other precincts will 'go and do
likewise.' "
OLYMPIA UNO SHELTON
MAIL CHANGES JUNE I
New Kamilche and Shelton to Be
Served by Auto Hereafter.
Mail service between Olympia and
Shelton will be carried by auto be
ginning next Thursday, June 1, the
star route contract having been
awarded to J. B. Eshom of this city,
president of the Olympia Garage com
pany. This was definitely , settled
when James F. Blakeslee, fourth as
sistant postmaster general, announc
ed that the department had rejected
the steamboat company's offer to car
ry the mails for $1,600, the amount
of the auto contract and S7OO less
than formerly paid the steamboat
company.
Besides effecting a saving of S7OO
on the Olympia-Shelton contract, the
postoffice department also saves the
$l,lOO a year previously paid the
mail boat on the New Kamilche route,
as the mail for that office will also be
carried under the Shelton contract.
Under this arrangement, the New
Kamilche postoffice will be moved to
the home of the postmaster, which is
on the Shelton road.
Where New Kamilche has been re
ceiving its mail about 6 o'clock in the
the evening, it will now receive it
about 7:30 in the morning, and resi
dents along its rural route will re
ceive their mail the same day instead
of a day later. Patrons of the rural
routes out of Shelton will also re
ceive their mail the same day it
leaves Olympia under the new ar
rangement. Two trips are to be
made daily between Olympia and
Shelton, the morning mail reaching
there about 8 o'clock and the after
j noon about 5.

roads in their campaigns; silos, land
clearing and general co-operation
with the Granges and farmers' clubs.
The Production and Marketing
committe was authorized to conduct
a crop survey of the county, to study
the t problems of organized produc
tion and organized marketing, and to
investigate the advisability of pro
posals for state and national market
ing bureaus. The Rural Activities
committee was instructed to co-oper
ate with the Cow-Testing Associa
tion, the Dairymen's Association, the
Potato club, the Poultry and Pet
Stock Association and similar organ

LISTER STARTS EARLY
TO PREPARE BUDGET
GOVERNOR INSTRUCTS HIS DE
PARTMENTS TO ASSEMBLE
DATA ON EXPENSES.
That the state may proiit to the
fullest extent possible under the bud
get system legalized by the legisla
ture in 1915, Governor Lister has
already formally notified all depart
ments under his supervision to begin
the work of assembling comprehen
sive and reliable information for the
use of the state board of finance in
making up the budget of state ad
ministration expense to be presented
next winter.
The early necessity of such action,
as well as forecast of what will be
required under the new system of
figuring state expenditure, are set
out in a communication which Gov
ernor Lister has sent to 48 state in
stitutions and boards. After citing
the details of the law which directs
the state board of finance, consisting
of the state treasurer, state auditor
and the governor, to prepare the bud
get, the governor said:
"To make the budget plan as out- (
lined by this law a success, It will be
necessary to have the active support
and assistance of the different
boards, commissions and officers of
the state In its preparation and I am
writing at this early date to the
heads of the different departments
which come under the direction of
the executive office, to request that
they immediately begin the consider
ation of the budget covering the de
partment or office under their control,
so that when the time comes that the
board of finance makes request for
information, it will be possible for
each of the departments to furnish
the same promptly and in a manner
that will be of real assistance to the
board of finance in the preparation of
a budget for submission to the next
legislature.
"I am now writing to request that
you first carefully consider the law
providing for the budget system, and,
second, that you take up for consid
eration such information as will be
required by the board of finance in
its work.
"While this board has not yet de
termined upon any general plan to
follow In connection with securing
the information necessary, yet I feel
sure there will be required a detailed
statement of the appropriations re
quested from the next legislature and
information regarding these requests
that will enable the board of finance
to take intelligent action covering
them."
lng them to escape. There is no
reason for such an attitude, the coun
ty authorities say, adding that it is
confined to a certain element in the
community. Though several girls
have tried to escape, Pearl Mann is
the only one to get away In the last
seven months.
"The investigation proved beyond
a doubt that, some of the Grand
Mound people do not appreciate their
duty to the state or they would riot
aid in breaking the law." Prosecut
ing Attorney Yantis says. "The
training school is a first class insti
tution and deserves the co-operation
of the people."

WAR DEPARTMENT HAS RECOM.
MENDED NEW STATION ON
PUGET SOUND.
Reports from Washington, D. C. t
that the war department had recom
mended the establishment of a brig
ade post on the prairie near Gate, de
signed as a precautionary more for
the defense of Willapa and Grays
harbors as well as Puget Sound, and
that the recommendation would prob
ably be carried out within a short
time, has prompted the Chamber of
Commerce to take the proposal up
with the department and with Sen
ator Jones with the view of Insuring
the location of the post near Olym
pia.
The establishment of the post, at
which approximately a fourth of the
mobile army of the nation, including
a large detachment of coast artillery,
is to be stationed, is part of the five
year plan of developing the regular
army recently authorized by con
gress, by which the number of troops
to be quartered in the Puget Sound
district is increased some 300 per
cent.
After the joint maneuvers in this
district in 1912, General Maus rec
ommended the establishment of a
post in the vicinity of Gate, and this
was concurred in by General Wood,
then chief-of-staff. The present plans
of the war department contemplate
the increase of the post at Vancouver
and the establishment of a brigade
post somewhere on Puget Sound, and
local people want the new station 10~
cated near this city.
Believing that the recommendation
for the post near Gate was made some
years ago, before Olympia had the
railroad facilities It now baa, the
Chamber of Commerce has written
the department and Senator Jones for
further information. It is argued
that now, with the operation of the
Point Defiance cut-off line between
Tacoma and Portland, a more stra
tegic location would be on Chambers'
Prairie southwest of the city, afford
ing transportation over the main line,
the Northern Pacific's Grays Harbor
branch, the Milwaukee and the 0.-W.,
and at the same time giving closer
access to Puget Sound.
