; We venture" the following answer
to the question of the correspondent
from Morris Chapel as to who first
preached the gospel to the Grecians
at Autioch: It was unnamed, un
official deciples who fled from per
secution in Cyprus and Cyrene. ?
While Cyprus was the home of
Bavnabas, it is impropable that he
was one of those who first preached
to the Grecians at Antioch, because
he was at Jerusalem when news of
what was being done at Antioch
was received by the church there,
and he was selected to go to Anti
och and help in this great work. .
, Those who first preached . the
gospel at Antioch were just unof
ficial Christians, what, we call lay
men, but they were as all who pro
fess Christianity should be, so filled
with the Holy Spirit, so dominated
by love amPcom passion for dying
humanity that wherever they went
they preached the glad tidings.
2 We must not think that because
we are not ministers or , elders or
Sunday school teachers we have no
commission to preach the word of
Chfist. Every Christian should be
a witness for Christ wherever he
goes. We need great, we need
learned preachers but our greatest
need is more spirit-filled laymen
whose every-day life is one contin
ued sermon for Christ.
