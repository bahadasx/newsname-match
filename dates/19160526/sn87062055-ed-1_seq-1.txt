FOB 5ETTINGJI00DS AFIRE
Albuquerque, N. M., May 18, 191G.
Apropos of the coming danger sea
son for forest fires, District Forestor
.Redington has caled attention to a
very interesting booklet issued '.by
Cornell University on pre-revolution-ary
forestry in America. Contrary
tothe general impression that Ameri
can forestry is of very recent growth,
it is pointed out that such first prin
ciples as the prevention of forest fires
developed with the first American
settlements. Only six years after the
Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock,
the colony passed a law-aimed to pre
vent the exhaustion of the local tim
'ber supply, and soon after a forest
fire "law was enacted, prohibiting the
setting of forest fires or even the
'burning of private lands except dur
ing certain seasons. Similar laws
were enacted by the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, the New Haven Settle
ments, the Providence Plantations,
'Pennsylvania, and others at about the
same or even earlier dates.
Some of the penalties prcscibed
were very curious. The law of "North
Carolina compelled the offender to
pay a fine of 25 pounds, or, lacking
this, "to receive on his bare back
-thlrty-tiinc Lashes, well . laid on."
"Burning of the woods, the law de
clared, is "destructive to cattle and
hogs, extremely prejudicial to soil,
and oftentimes of fatal consequences
-to 'Planters and Farmers, be destroy
ing their fences and improvements."
Thus again do we learn, says the
"District "Forester, that there 1s at
least a modicum of truth in the old
saying: '"There is nothing new under
"the sun."

said senator Nuttman of San Mateo.
"What does my colleague suppose I

"Does my colleague wish to answer

Yes," replied Nuttman. "Let my

PENALTY FOR HIS CRIME
.Just five years and two .days after
bis original conviction in the superior
court of Maricopa county of the crime
of murdering his wife, Francisco Ro

of his crime, being executed in the
state prison at Florence last Friday

Rodriguez met his fate with con

SILVER SERVICE FOR BATTLESHIP ARIZONA
WILL BE DISPLAYED AT FLAGSTAFF JULY 4
The committee to select and con
tract for the purchase of a silver set
for 'the battleship Arizona entered
into a contract with Maurice It
Meade, rcpresentat've of the manu
facturing jewelry Jinn of Reid & Bar
ton of Massachusetts for the manu
facture of the trophy. Walter A
Hcge, a Phoenix jeweler, is the repre
sentative o fthe firm in Phoenix and
was also present when the contract
was made.
Huge was a member of the original
committee appointed to investigate
the cost of such a service and at his
own expense made a trip east last
summer and secured a price on it of
$7861.70. This price was quoted when
silver was forty-seven cents, and in
spite of the fact that the present
price is seventy-seven cents no "ad
vance was asked by the manufactur
ing firm.
This is the net price, and no com
mision is paid to anyone out of it, as
Hcge donates his services. The con
tract calls for the delivery of the set
at Flagstaff on July 4, where it will
be placed on exhibition for a few days
and then taken to different cities in
the state for exhibition, so that the
citizens generally will have an op
portunity of seeing it before its pres
entation to the war vessel.
Speaking of the design adopted for
the service, Meade says that his "firm
WILL APPOINT THREE
MORE TO WEST POINT
Adjutant General Harris is consid
ering three names eligible for ap
pointment to West Point Military
Academy from the National Guard of
Arizona.
Under the law just passed, each
state is permitted to name a member
of one year's standing, between the
ages of 19 and 22, for entrance into
the big military institution. The,
coming appointment from Arizona
will be the first to be made under the
new law.
Applicants must successfully take
the same entrance examination that
Is held for congressional appointees.
The Arizona guard contains a number
of young fellows who arc in line for
the appointment, and it was with
some difficulty that Colonel Harris
narrowed the choice down to three,
using their records in the service as
the basis for his selection. The names
will be recommended to Governor
Hunt, who will make the formal ap
pointment. Moves Santa Fe Office to Phoenix
The date for the removal of the
general freight and passenger offices
of the SantaFc railroad, from Pres
cott. to Phoenix, which was decided on
several months ago, and previously
announced, has been fixed, for June
first, when the alterations and repairs
now under way on the building in
, which they will be located are com
pleted. The only officials affected by
the change will be F. P. Crulcc, assi-
' stant general freight and passenger i
I agent, and his chief clerk, G. E. Har- j
I rison. The. offices of the auditor and.
treasurer of the local .branch of the
road were removed about two -years
ago to San Francisco.

The Country Newspapers Pay
The newspapers of the country re
gardless of political affiliation, have
come to the conclusion that the gov
ernment of the United States, as re
presented by the postoffice depart
ment, are letting the magazines of
the country get away ,with a subsidy
each year amounting to at least five
millions, while the newspapers are
paying the freight The government
is now hauling magazines over the
country, at distances of from 1000 to
1,500 miles, and distributes them at
the same rate newspapers are sent
on an average haul of from 50 to 100
miles. This is one of the reasons for
the rule that a newspaper may. be
mailed at the one cent a pound rate '
only on the .date of publication, for
some one must pay it; the country
newspaper is the outfit the payment
has been "wished" on because there
js little or no fear that the country
editor has influence enough or incli
nation to make a fight against the in
justice. The National One Cent Post
age Association, of Cleveland, Ohio,
seems to think that one cent is suffi
cient to pay for a letter, notwith
standing the fact that all other costs
have gone skyward and the govern- '
ment has already economized to the
extent of putting cheaper glue on
stamps and cutting out several holes
in the perforations. The average
fellow ntJ Arizona does not care a
whoop whether it is one or two cent
nostage, but he wduld like to have a
stamp that you could rip off the sheet
without putting your foot on it, and
one that would stick after it was
tongue-walloped.
These are the days in which one is
expected to sign up a few initative
