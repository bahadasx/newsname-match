The editor in visiting Island Pond
Wednesday noticed the many changes
in town which have taken place
since last fall. The "clean-up'

start and the fruits of it could be
seen on every hand. We are glad
to see this interest taken in the
work; also that the schools are work
ing along the same line, the best es.
ays from the different grades re-
ating to the subject of which will
appear in this paper. Remember
the Herald is with you in every
thing that relates to the welfare of
the town. A town is just what the
people make it and it should be the
aim of all, working together, to
keep Island Pond to the front.
Arthur Eggleston, age 21, of Sut
ton, Vt., is at the present time in a
critical condition at the hospital in
Sherbrooke and suffering from in
juries received last Monday evening,
while walking on the track near
Stevens' over-head bridge some
two and one half miles west of here.

eggleston naa leit nis home some
days previous to the accident to visit
the camp of his uncle, Patrick Don
ahue, making the trip on a bicycle and
decided to make the rest of the trip
by foot. After visiting his uncle,
with two other comrades started to
walk to Island Pond on the track.
On nearing the Stevens bridge they
heard an approaching train, which
was within a short distance from
them; all made a jump for the side
of the track, when Eggleston jump
ed he in some way lost his footing
and was thrown back toward the
train, being struck by it. He
was thrown a considerable distance
and was in an unconscious state
when found by his comrades, who in
some way attracted the attention of
the engine crew who were helping
the train over the summit. He was
quickly taken to this place, the train
crew rendering first aid, to the
Y. M. C. A. emergency room and
was attended by Doctors Elie and
Sargent; upon examination by the
physicians it was found that there
war a compound fracture of the left
forearm and the left leg was badly
crushed at the knee, which it may
be necessary to amputate. His
parents at Sutton were notified by
telephone, arriving at eleven o'clock
by auto. He was removed to Sher
brooke that night, where the at
tending physicians report his con
dition favorable.

A Successful Singer.
The following notice concerning
one of Groveton's young ladies was
taken from a recent New York City
daily pager:
"Miss Lina Scott, a young dia
matic singer of New Hampshire,
who is a pupil of Ralfe Leech Ster
ner, has made a decidedly favorable
impression on her New York ali
enees and won praise by her work
in Vissi D'Arte, Vissi D'Amore, by
Tosca and Puccini, at the New York
School of Music and Art Concert,
Thursday evening, May 4, 1916.
Miss Scott's graceful nersonalitv.
high soprano voice, with Mile Helen
Wolverton at the piano, aroused
universal admiration. , Her inherited
musical sense, allied with unusual
mentality, makes this young singer
very attractive, both to musicians
and the general public. She has
qualities which will make her suc
cessful in her vocal career. Miss
Scott began her musical career in
the Presentation of Mary Con
vent, Coaticooke, P. Q., after which
she went to Hartford, Conn., Conser
vatoire of Music, studying under
Prof. Theo Vanyorx. She has studied
also under Prof. Edward Leopold,
diploma graduate of Royal Conserva
toire of Music and Theatre, Dresden,
Germany."
Miss Scott is well known here
having been a former resident, and
is the sister of George Scott who
resides here at the present time.
Set Out 4000 Pines.
t
H. H. Hobson, who has a great in
terest in forestry, has set out 2500
Scotch pines on the property of his
sister, known as York hill. Also 1000
Scotch pines and 500 white pines on
his property known as the old But
terfield place, about one and one
half miles west of the village.
The trees are set eight feet apart
each way, and range from three to
six inches in height and are of the
average age of three years. Accord
ing to thetbulletins of the state for
estry department this spring has
been ideal for the starting of forest
plantations. The soil of Mr. Hob-son's-
plantation is ideal for the
growth of Scotch and white pine.
Over four million trees have been
planted in Vermont during the past
seven years. Every plantation has
its educational value, which in
creases with age. A pine plantation
forty years old will produce an aver
age of 25,000 board feet to the acre,
and one 50 years old at least 35,000
feet. The average number of trees
to the acre set eight feet apart is be
tween 700 and 800. The area al
ready planted in the state is ex
pected to yield by 1955 about one
hundred million board feet, and
by 1965 at least one nundred and
forty million board feet. The esti
mated cut in 1965, were it placed on
freight cars would fill over 8000
cars.
Whereas Mr. Hobson does not pro
hibit trespassing on these properties,
and is willing that the plantation
should be used for educational pur
poses, persons while in the planta
tion should exercise extreme care
not to step on the trees. In most
instances the trees are not much
higher than the grass and very hard
to distinguish from other vegetation.
"Clean-Up Week"
By Waver P. Lampher, Grade v.
Our streets have been in very bad
condition. Tin cans have been
thrown around in the back yards,
and that causes flies to swarm around
and the poison which is in the cans
kills the flies. This makes a very
bad smell.
Also, when people come out of
the postoffice they throw letters and
papers down on the ground. This
paper blows all over the town when
ever a little wind comes up.
Spitting on the street is also a

ery untidy thing, because women
come along and it pets on the bottom
of their skirts and microbes form on
them.
Our streets could be in just as
good condition as if men went
around and picked up the papers if
we tried. With little places set off
and flowers growing in these places
it would improve .our town. Even
without the .flowers green grass
would be pretty; because our city
friends don't see very many flowers,
and grass is not very common to
them.
If you have an old fence in your
back yard that does not look very
nice, a quick running vine would
cover up the desolate look. The
wild cucumber vine grows very
quickly and is very pretty.
If you wish to have a vine that
grows slowly, plant it and then
right near them plant a quick run
ning vine and in the fall when they
die, tear them down. When spring
comes and the ground thaws out
your vine-seeds that you planted the
summer before sprout and it grows
up quickly again.
The one way that I know of to
keep our town clean and tidy is for
each person to do their share.
Then we will have a clean, tidy town.
People going through here to other
places will say, (if our town is clean)
"What a pretty little town!"
