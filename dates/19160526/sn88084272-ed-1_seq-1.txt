measures which they allege were

to put brakes on the agitation for a
more vigorous submarine campaign.
Deputy Oertel, who Is editor of the
Deutsche Tages Zeltung. attacked the
authorities vigorously for their at
tempt to suppress the gigantic peti
tion gotten up by Prof. Deltrich
Schaefer of Berlin university against
Germany's yielding to the demands of
the United States.
Anti-American Article Suppreed.
Deputy Oertel also attacked the
government censorship which had
been exercised over the editorial com
ment on the American note and pro
hibiting the publication of an anti
American article written by the con
servative leader Heyedbrand.
Foreign minister von Jagow. in re
ply, declared emphatically that both
the military and political authorities
had asrreed that - negotiations with
America must not be Impeded by press
comment. The minister said tba:

The War At a Glance
VIOLENT fighting continues
on the Verdun front, but has
resulted in few changes, ac
cording to the French war office,
which says the French have re
gained some of the ground lost
Thursday between Haudremont
wood and the Thtaumont farm,
east o fthe Meuse.
The Austrian dr.ve into Italian
territory apparently is not proceed
ing with any thing like its initial
velocity. The opinion is expressed
in Rome that a continuance of the
advance will show a reversal of
conditions.
Indications that some military
move of importance is impending in
the Balkans are contained in dis

Three Americans were wounded and
one? died shortly after .H-ing shot. An
alarm ttas immediately sent to the
garrison at Las Cruces and a troop of
cavalry under Lieut- B. T Merchant, of
New fork, who is attached to the 13th
cavalry, was sent in pursuit.
Followed Into Canyon.
The bandits scattered as soon as they
were fired upon by the engineers and
fled In general disorder up Alemeda
canyon to get into the Babicora coun
try. A troop of the 11th cavalry, Capt.
Guy Cusbman. Newport. R. I., started
soon towards the bandits, who were
pursued several miles, and engaged
them. Two bandits were killed and a
number wounded. Among the dead
was Cervantes, whose body was identi
fied by the presidente and other resi
dents of Las Cruces, who were well
acquainted with the famous bandit.
Bodies Heine Held.
The bodies, by order of Gen. Per
shing, were brousrht here for further
identification in order that there may
be no mistake.
Both men were killed l,y George O.
Hulitt. of the 17th infantry machine
gun company, who was himself
wounded.
The point at which the attack was
made was about the last place at which
an attack was looked for. However.
Cervantes had been chas-d so closely
for the past few das from all direc
tions that it is bel eved he was in
desperation, driven to cross the valley
at this point and ran into the road re
pair crew unaware of its presence. In.
the crew were a number of Mexican
laborers but in the fight no Mexicans
were hurt so far as known.

The engineers had as an escort whllo
doing the road work a company or the
17th infantry and tbe infantrymen as
well as all the engineer, returned the
fire of the bandits and wounded

When warning of the attack was
sent to Las Cruce all the cavalry was
out grazing but luckto tbe command
under Lieut. Merchant, on the way
south to join their respective regi
ments, and which had stayed over a day
to rest, was in the garrison and their
horses were saddled and pursuit at
once taken up.

after noon. and. after a running flgji
in which two bandits were killed and
