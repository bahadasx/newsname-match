NOTED ENTERTAINER
AT M. E. CHURCH.
One of the very best entertain
ments of its kind ever given in
Sioux Falls, was that given by
Chas Riley McCalley at the high
school auditorium Tuesday after
noon. As an interpreter of James
Whitconih Riley's droll poems.
Mr. McColley certainly has no
surperiors, and as an all around
versatile entertainer he stands
alone. He is not only a gifted
reader and impersonator but the
is a splendid violinist and his
sense of humor knows no bound.
When a performer can hold the
attention of five hundred high
school students for one hour and
'wenty minutes and leave them
clamoring for more, it certainly
is worth the while and price.—
Sioux Falls Argus-Leader.
REGISTER NOW IF
YOU WOULD VOTE.
Everybody must register this
year in order to vote in the pri
maries next month.
Every voter must also state
what party he belongs 'to and
have this noted on the poll lists
or he will not he allowed to vote.
Many citizens, it appears are not
.'aware of these two requirements
at the primary election and have
failed to register and also failed
to designate their party affilia
tions. The primary election is a
party affair and the law has been
so drawn as to prevent men of one
party voting the ticket of another
party. True, there is a provision
for swearing in voters who for
some unavoidable reason have
failed to register according to
law, but anyone who has tried
this konws how hard it is to do
so.
Remember, you cannot vote un
less you register, and you must
give your party preference.
Otto Wojohn, the young son of
Gus Wojohn, met with a severe
accident Monday morning while
preparing to go to school. The
lad was climbing into a rig, and
through a misunderstanding, the
driver started up before he could
gain his seat. When the horses
started, he was thrown to the
ground, the vehicle running over
him before he could get out of
the way. His leg was broken, and
he sustained severe bruises about
the body. For a time it was fear
ed he was injured internally, but
this was found afterwards to be
not the case. He was taken to the
Stough hospital, where he is be
ing treated for his injuries.
Slope Bankers to
Meet Here in 1917
Fifth Annual Convention
Next May.
At the conclusion of a very
pleasant and profitable conven
tion of the bankers of the Mis
souri Slope, held at Dickinson
last week, when a sumptuous ban
quet held in the capacious din
ing room of the St. Charles hotel
was enjoyed by a large member
ship of the association, Beach
was designated as the point at
which the fifth annual convention
will be held next May. This is a
signal honor for Beach, and one
which is thoroughly appreciated,
the result of excellent work on
the part of the Chamber of Com
merce of this city. Local bankers
will plan a royal welcome to the
Missouri Slope bankers frater
nity when they visit Beach next
May.
We regret that space does not
permit of our giving a list of the
Hicials elected for lh» ensuing
year, but are glad to note the re
cognition Beach has secured in
the election to the office of vice
president of Thomas E. Hayward,
cashier of the Golden Valley Slate
hank.
ANOTHER PHOTOPLAY
MASTERPIECE
And another big scoop!
The Selig ten-act screen ver
sion of Rex Beach's "The Ner'er
Do-Well" is considered to be the
greatest moving picture product
ion since "The Birth of a Nation."
"The Ne'er-Do-Well," with all
its depth of love and soft, sweet
producing beauty, and fiendish
jealousy, and black intrigue—
with the naked passions of men
and women bared before you as
only Rex Beach can bare them.
With its hero football player
from NewYork ensnared alike by
the dazzling Southern beauty Chi
luita and the seductive Edith
Cortlandt, wife of the other man.
The production will be shown
at the Beach Opera House Thurs

'act that it now carries over $800,

From organizations to date the

The business is conducted in

boys of the Montana range will
slnve to hold their title as the
champion riders of the world.
The secretary has recently is
sued a statement in which the
celebrated "Powder River" cow
hands challenged the world to
oroduce more daring and skill
ful riders, asserting also that the
management will offer a hand
some prize to the party that can
"reduce a horse, steer or a buffalo
that cannot be ridden.
The Miles City round-up is re

years there has been much
controversy among the voters
about the salaries drawn by the
officials of this county. Golden
Valley county was segregated
Irom this county in November
1912, but the officials of Billings
county continued, for the year of
1913, to draw their salaries on the
valuation of both counties that
is both Billings and Golden Val
ley, as il was before the segrega
tion. For the year 1914 salaries
were paid on a proper valuation.
Slope county was segregated in
the year 1914, but since that time
Billings county officials have con
tinued to draw salaries on the
valuation of both counties.
I he statutes provide that cer
tain salaries shall he based on the
valuation of the county for the

often been asked: What was the
valuation of Billings county, for
he year 1913 on which salaries
should have been based? The of

There is no dispute on this point.
