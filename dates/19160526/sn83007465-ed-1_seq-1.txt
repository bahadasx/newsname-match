their unprecedented bombardments 1
and vicious infantry attacks while the 5
French are replying to the German '
guns virtually shot for shot, and iin- '
der withering fire holding the Ger- '
mans at almost every point. '
One more gain, however, has been '
made by the Germans. After re- '
capturing Fort Douaumcnt ar.;l i?I; '
Ing trenches south and southwest of s
the fort, the Germans to the west '
have occupied a section of French '
trenches after a series ot attacks, in r
all of which they were repulsed with
heavy casualties except the one j
where they penetrated the French j.
lines.

Around Douaumont a heavy artil- ^
t lery duel is in progress and northI
west of Verdun the Germans have in- v
creased their artillery activities a- v
gainst the French on Hill 304, proh- j,
ably preparatory to another Infantry (.
attack for possession of this much

Russian troops with the British forces n
in thp region of Kut-el-Amara. The f(
Russians came from the region of

Governing Contest.
In connection with, the "Better
abies Contest" which will he held
t the Graded school building, Lanistcr,
Thursday and Friday. Juno
and 'J, all mo there are urged to
nter their babies for the purpose
f having them given a thorough exmi
nation by specialists sent here
ir that purpose.
Please remember this is no
Beauty Con! d." cotton up for the
urpose of designating the most
? autiful baby in the community, but
simply a business proposition to
rquaint you with the true conion
of your baby from a health
audpolnt. Also remember there Is
n cost in connection with same; the
vamination is absolutely free, so
o not hesitate longer, but get in
iroct touch with Mrs. W. H. Millen
nd ent. r your baby. Each mother
required to furnish a hahv blanket
id towel to be used in connection
ith examination.
Object
The p. tier Babies Contest is a
?pn!ar. yet scientific movement to
isure better babies and a better
ice. Physical and mental developon
t only are cpt^gldered; mere boau
does not count.
The Better Babies Contest inires
a hotter race of Americans, beiuso
it tenches parents how to im ove
the physical condition of
lildren already born and to proct
those yet unborn.
It arouses interest in tne conserstion
of child life and health and
all forms of child welfare work.
It forge? a connecting link hereon
naren's unit tonctinrc
e home and the scientific study of
did life.
It promotes civic interest in chll pn
of the community, their schools
id their recreations.
And, finally, by means of a unirm
sc? . card, it will supply to the
edieal profession what has lone:
>en wanting?scientific data con rning
the normal child.
The Better Babies Contest is most,
iluahlc to the community when it
conducted along educational rather
lan competitive lines. The greatest
'turn which parents and children
>cure from the contest is more
nowledge and better care through
te examination of the child by comment
physicians. Small defects ar'
ncovered and remedies are suggest1.
Parents leave the contest knowing
iorr about their children than they
ver knew before, and the children
re given a better start in life because
f the knowledge gained by the
arents. If this matter can b>i
rought clearly before the parents,
nd if children are entered, nut for
rizes but for information and help,
he contest will be placed on the highst
possible plane.
