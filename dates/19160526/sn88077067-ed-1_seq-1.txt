Instrumental In the defeat of the Cold

romped houie on Alc( onib's two-saeker.
In the seventh and eighth Innings he was
lirst up; singled in both instances scoring
oil hingies by lietz. With the sucks full
ami two out in tlie third he went up
against the fence in left lield and made a
most sensational catch of a line drive
from James' bat, which looked goo for
a home run .Again in the lifth with
the bases full and only one down, he
came in and pulled a seemingly safe bit
oat of the grass with another sensational
one-hand drive, doubling up on ucltingcr
at second for tne linal out. He was the

He spoke of the peculiar si "iiilicani e ol

whose cradles were in the land far be
yond the sea have adopted the land of
ihe free, and though in sympathy with
their brethcrn abroad, are loyal to the
land of adoption. Disregarding sympath
ies we local Americans would resent the
charge of disloyalty. However he would
not speak of political loyalty but of syn
odical loyalty.
Not because it is the largest synodical
bodv but because of the true fundamental
principles and doctrines taught In the
Lutheran church. f irst because the
Word of Cod is the only rule and guide
of these fundamental principles taught
in their nciT v we as pastors and people
should manifest our loyalty.

A thesis bv Rev. II. N. Hrobst on the
subject, "Fundamental l'rinciples of the
Inlerpielation of the Scripture" proved
very interesting and helpful and provoked
animated discussion. A casual ouestion
was presented: "What do you think of
conference on the vested choir in the
cnurcli?" The answer: "l.'nless the use
ol vestments on the part of me choir
gives real offense, we see no objection to
it."

didate for congress as long as N. W.
Cunningham entertains hope of being el
ected to that position.
(loei ke's attitude, as implied III the ul
timatum and even more f lrongly bet 1 en
the lines, Is that the Rlulllon bunker was
directly responsible for the injection or
ilenonilnationalism in I In- last campaign.
He also 1. tales that he has no desire to
go to congress, but that In order lo elim
inate Cunningham us u laclor he will
make the race, adding that the church
10 used In the- last light has no place
polities and must be removed by re
moving the instigator.
The statement lakes a nuinner 01 var
I turns and is apparently directed to
several groups, rust, in- explains unit
he desiies to inform those who are afraid
to run because of his anticipated entrunci
just where he stands.
rn.-n he slat
that personal
mbitions have, nothing to
w th it. The venture would be 11 11-
ncl.il loss because of the lllterlerence
Willi his law practice. Ihe hexl turn IS
toward a historical resume, charging Cun
ningham with breach 01 laith. and declar
ing thai the latter was put into the r:
of Rill by "illllllenccs outside the ths-
tiict. From this he launches into a
personal estioiate of his rival, which can
he class, 11 nine warm in icnor.
he Wupakoneta attorney then devotes
his attention to tlie need ol an "available
indidate"w In, can lie elected and become
u -eful m Washington. In this connection
lucie is a trace ol advice lo country ran-
litis throughout the district regarding
the presence on the ticket ol a "nnll-
lone." And here enters tne challenge
that unless Cunningham abandons the
idea of goig to cogress after Hi" light
ol two years ago, (JoecKe will "lake all
the voters of the district into my con-
Ihlence and give them some interesting
information that is now known to hut
nnparativcly lew. ill other weirds, he
iiidicafes that he has something ready
. "spring.
(loecke's closing sentence hopes 'that
this w ill not become necessary." tS heth-
110! it wil bring up the iiuestiou as
to what the Wapakoneta man con.-lders
the necessity, Hie inference is that he Is
to be tlie judge himself, for the context
shows plainly that he will run unless
Cunningham decides not lo do so.
this gives the ultimatum 1 ne uspeci
01 a demand lor a showdow n, uoeeHo ev
ent ly believeing he holds the nigh card.
There is just enough' ol" toe tleiinile
the challenge to show the frame or
ind of the attorney, for he makes it
plain to the other prospective entrants
nat his own decision lies w mi i 1111-
ninghain. Hut there is also enough ol the
ague to leave the matter up III the all
loecke does not slate positively what he
vtill do, but makes it contingent on a
of preposii tonal words such us II
md "unless" and the like.
All cm s turn to Cunningham as tne re
sult of (.loecke's stalment. I hat he will
come back with either tottil denials or
set 01 counter charges appears to la
the concensus of opinion. The (,oecke
proclamation apparently calls lor an 1111-
wer, ill that 11 does not i-nn in a acon
ite conclusion, and tne tact mac tne tor
mer congressman claims to have "some
interesting iniormation." adds to the 111-
rest of the electorate.
k seems not impossible that the Klull-
ton man will ignore the throat, nut tne
minion bellel is that he will disclaim
the authorship ol the religious issue hy
simply retorting that he cannot be held

I'he text ol the statement prepareu ny

dance with the '-anonymous utlac. ' stat
ute, is as lollows:
In vh-w Ol Ule laer mill IIH- lime unl
it for the announcement e. candidans
for Congress is soon lo expire, and tnai
there Is a general impression throughout
e district that I am a candidate lor tne
moiratie nominalion. 1 feel that it is
onlv fair to iose who may be desirous
of entering Hie contest that I should make
statement of my position, especially
since mv mends an over ine uisirici nave
boen constantly urging me again to be-
ome a candidate, sayms thai my nat ai
eady is in the ring.
"I want to lirst make It plum that
mv hat is not 111 tne ring won my con
sent. 1 have privately advised my friends
from time to time that 1 was averse to
becoming a candidate again at this time
cause ol the great personal sacrilice

fwo tears ago Mr. Cunningham came
to Washington and urged nie to again be-
01110 a candidate tor congress anji pieu
e.l me his support. It he had kept his
word 1 would have had no opposition in
the primary; my election would have been
foregone conclusion and the uisirici
would not now be represented by a re
publican. He permitted hiniselt to he set
into the light bv inllueiices outside ot the
district and then proceeded, by the aid
if his political henchmen and manipula
tors, to conduct a campaign, tne no-moos
I which were both illegal und reprenen

and sending to congress the first republl-
'iii in the 1 storv ot the dlslrict. lie and
his political manipulators, and no one else
ponsllile me.reior. every wen-in-
lormed citizen of the Fourth district
knows this statement to be true. A man
whose word is not good under any cir
cumstance Is not lit to represent any 01s-
trict in Congress. The met nods employ -
1 to bring about his nominal ion w nen
fullv understood by the people of this nis-i.-,,.
mii'lil md will make llis candidacy
an Impossibility. If nominated he would
prove a millstone nhout the neck of every
candidate on the democratic ticket, from
president down and drag many of them
into defeat. The lesson of two years ago
ought to be siitliclent warning to Cun
ningham and his henchmen that this will
be the result.
"While 1 urn in no wise responsible,
either directly or indirectly, for this de
plorable political condition in the district
and there is no good reason why it ought
In the slightest degree to affect my can
didacy, if I should have any desire to fil
ler the contest, yet 1 feel that democratic
success this year is of much greater im
portance than the personal success of any
one man, und therefore I stand ready to
join in a movement with all unselfishness
and right-thinking democrats to bring
about the nomination of a cand'dato who
can command the united support of ev
ery democrat in tlie district, thereby
strengthening not only the national and
state tickets but save from certain tie
feat many candidates for uistrict and
county otKces.
"No candidate thus far has made any
declaration us to where he stands on the
great questions that are pressing for so
lution and will be Involved it the next
campaign. Mr. Cunningham has stated
privately that his great desire to go to
Congress was for the purpose of sound
ing out his career whatever that may
be. He slated publicly that he was en
titled to tbis nomination because he had
run once before and had been defeated.
Roth reasons for wanting the nomination
was of the merest rot an insult to the
intelligence of the voters of ihe Fourth
District. They are not worthy ot con
sideration uhd are simply tho .watchword
of a designing and cunning politicia wh
of a designing and cunning
politician who fails on public
tiuestions or lacks the courage of his
convictions, 1 uni in favor of nominating
and electing a man to Congress who
wants to go there to work for the in
