Maintaining Bond-Built
Roads
Male Ample Provision for Upkleep--ASats
of State Highway Reports on
Cost of Matntenance
(Prepared by the U S. Department of Agrtculture,
Cedar Creek Concrete Bridge, Louisville, Ky.
The problem of maintaining high
ways constructed with borrowed
money should be given as much con
sideration as is devoted to the more
permanent features of the roadbed.
It has not been customary for offi
cials to face frankly the cost of the
maintenance and repair of bond-built
highways at the time the bonds are
issued and before construction begins.
As a matter of fact, investigations
made by the department show that in
the majority of cases where bonds
have been issued by local authorities
there has been no provision whatever
for maintaining the roads when built.
This is perhaps the greatest defect in
the method of building highways by
issuing bonds.
Maintenance is necessary in order
to insure to the community the maxi
mum economic service by the road,
and also to preserve the investment
The cost of maintenance and repairs
must, therefore, be studied at the
outset. In the absence of general
data, the reports on maintenance from
states which have highway depart
ments should be of interest to county
officers preparing to issue road-build
ing bonds.
Cost of Maintenance.
The following opinions as to main
tenance cost represent the results of
careful analyses of state highway re
ports, as well as much first-hand in
formation gathered by the depart
ment's specialists:
Well-constructed gravel roads will
sometimes sustain several years of
farm traffic without showing marked
deterioration, even when there has
been no maintenance. Such roads
sometimes actually improve during
the second season; more frequently,
however, they show ruts or chuck
holes. It cannot be expected that the
average life of a gravel surface will
be greater than that of a macadam
surface, which in the New England
and eastern states is between six and
seven years. If a sum equal to two
thirds of the original cost of the
gravel surface itself is provided for
renewals at six-year intervals, it
should be estimated at from $150 to
$250 per mile per year. If $30 is then
allowed for annual dragging and small
repairs, the total annual cost of re
pair and maintenance for gravel roads
would be from $180 to $280 per mile.
The annual cost of maintenance alone
is sometimes below $30. In Ben
nington county, Vt., during 1912, 175
miles of gravel roads were maintained
at a cost of $20.70 per mile. The an
nual cost of maintenance and repair
on sand-clay roads, including all nec
essary resurfacing at periodic inter
vals, should not be fixed at less than
10 per cent of the original cost.
What Figures Show.
Thb cost of repair and maintenance
for water-bound macadam roads has
been determined with considerable ex
actness from Massachusetts figures
and checked by resurfacing charges in
other states and in Germany. Prior
to 1913, from $100 to $125 per year
ordinarily paid for necessary small
.ii

' y"
repairs, such as patching, cleaning
culverts, etc., and from $400 to $425
per year was the necessary annual
charge in order to resurface at pe
riods varying from six to seven years,
The sum of $525 per mile, on an aver
age, should therefore maintain mac
adam reads if changes and increases
of traffic are not excessive. It must
be understood, however, that in many
instances where macadam sufficed for
the volume and character of traffic
prior to 1906, it will not withstand the
action of the motor vehicle traffic
which has developed since that time.
Many miles of ordinary or water
bound macadam road have been re
surfaced with bituminous materials,
and many miles of new bituminous- C
macadam have been constructed. The
logical maintenance of such highways
is a surface treatment with bitumi
nous material and rock screenings.
clean gravel, or sharp sand. The cost
of such surface treatment is from 4
to 12 cents per square yard, and it
may be expected to last from one to
three years, according to the density
of traffic aid the success of the appli
cation. Theoretically, perfect surface
treatment would constitute absolute
maintenance for a bituminous-mac
adam road. Such maintenance is
seldom or never realized and bitumi
nous-macadam roads doubtless require
resurfacing at intervals. The cost of
such resurfacing is not yet known.
Repair and Maintenance.
The average cost for repair and
maintenance of 7,300 miles of highway
in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
York, New Jersey and Rhode Island,
for the year 1912, was about $800 per
mile. A large part of this money was
expended for bituminous resurfacing
and bituminous surface treatment.
There is some question whether the
I expenditure correctly measures the
i average cost of repairing and main
Staining bituminous-macadam roads.
i In the state of New York, however,
for the years 1911 and 1912 the aver
age cost for repair and maintenance
r was $724 per mile upon a total aver
t age of 2,861 miles. The annual cost
of repair and maintenance on Masse
chusetts state roads for the years
1 1910, 1911 and 1912 was, respectively,
P $642, $647 and $676 per mile for about
m 850 miles. For the most part these
f. igures for New York and Massachua
a setts represent the cost per mile of
resurfacing with bituminous material
5 and of maintaining bituminous-macad
i am and water-bound macadam roads
L- by surface treatment with bituminous
r material. It is clear, therefore, that
- for heavy traffic trunk line roads $70C
- per mile is not an excessive estimate
a at present for the annual cost of all
repair and maintenance on bitumi
nous-macadam roads.
a Build Them Now.
C- Some day we will be unanimously of
a the opinion that the way to save
a money on roads is to build them now.
r The cost per ton mile for hauling on
r hard-surfaced roads should not exceed
1 13 cents.
