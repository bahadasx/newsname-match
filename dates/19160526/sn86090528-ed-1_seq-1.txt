RUSSIAN FISHER MAIDS
GO TO- THE FRONT,
Petrograd, May 2fi. The
spirit that animates Russian
women to flgbt was shown'
among the fisher-folk colony at
Novgorod recently when Pele
geya M a n d r I n returned
wounded from her regiment af-.
ter fightliffe in seven actions.
She recruited seventy" girl
warriors among the fisher-folk
and when General Kuropatkin
arrived from his estate at
Pskof f she fell on her knees
before him and Implored him
to allow the fisher girl's brig
ade to go to the front.
Kuropatkin refused because',
women are "not allowed" in the
Russian army. So they cut off
their long hair, dressed as men
and scattered themselves
among the troops over the
thousand milo front. Those
fisher-girl warriors rely on the
unwritten law of Russian regi
ments for their protection.
