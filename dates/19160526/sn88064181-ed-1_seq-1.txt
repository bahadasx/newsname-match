A GEORGIA BREEDER'S OPINION.
You don't know how much I appreciate
your Medleated Salt Brick, which I have
been using for several years. No stock
owner can afford to be without them. I
know of several cases where cows would
not breed that commenced safter using the
brick regularly. It Is especially fine for
mares In fool, and I know it knocks worms
out of pigs. It keepe all stock in a healthy
workldng condition it uaed treely. It.~eeps
their liver and digestive organs in load
shape, which insures feed going one-third
further. It pays for Itself ten times over
In the increased health and looks of the
stock. LORI~NG BROWN.

We pu'chased two solid cars this season, which guar- .

than you could possibly obtain elsewhere. This large L
purchase enables us to maintain the same prices we have tc
made for the past four years, notwithstanding the fact: ai
that all the factories have advanced their prices over 25 ai
per cent. cl
This is one of the many advan- el
tages of buying from us.
A solid car of chain and lawn swings just T
received. Our No. 1 swing is made of solid oak,
full bolt construction, has best quality souldered

AbsIutely millions of dollars were
saved ad countless families lived better

crisis ad general business depression.
Howvere these burdensome store bills

An Entertainment of More than the Usual Merit
Friday evening quite a large
audience, containing many out
of town visitors, were most
pleasantly entertained at the
high school auditorium by mem
bers of the junior,sophomore and
freshmen classes.
The vehicle of amusement was
a farce entitled "A Case of Sus
pension" which depicted the
consternation and subsequent
triumph of three young ladies of
a seminary who were discovered
by a professor entertaining three
young men.
The members of the cast de.
serve more than passing praise
for the striking histrionic ability
and with hats off to each and
every member of the cast we
here present them again:
