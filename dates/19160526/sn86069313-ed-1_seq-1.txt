SEATTLE FAMILV DOAKTS
OF EDUCATED KAUIIIT
Seattle, Wash., May 22. Benjamin
Buhny Is Seattle's smartest rabbit.
Ho Is large In size, malteso and white
In color and so Intelligent that his
mistress, Miss Alice Warner, challen
ges tho world to produce his equal.
Miss Warner is nt present a student
ut Carloton College, Northfleld, Minn.,
but during her absenco tho members
of her family havo not neglected Ben
jamin's education, so that his present
reportolro of tricks Is, for a rabbit,
-somewhat extensive
Benjamin can and will do tho fol
lowing astonishing things:
Play hldo and seek with the child
Ten, apparently laughing heartily atv
iho frolic.
When told It Is "bedtime for bun
nies" ho runs across tho lawn and
flattens himself on the grass.
When told to dig a hole he will go
to work lns(autor and quits only at
a stern command. It not told to dlff
a hole, he digs twlco a day anyway,
being methodical in his pleasures. -
When left alone never leaves limits
indicated by somo member of the
family.
Is a bon companion of a cat named
Kelly (no, tho cat won't eat tho rab
bit because a rabbit has a kick In hH
hind logs like ft. mule), and now tho
Warners nro trying to teach the cat
to pat tho rabbit.
Benjamin's favorite dainties are
raspberry Jam and raisins. His diet
Includes carrots but ho does not
think much of them white crackers
and a potato a day. He must have
tho potato to bo happy.
Benjamin was brought to the "War
ner home four years ago on Valentine
Day. Tho day after he arrived Mr.
.Warner commenced teaching him,
telling him ho would have to sit up
If ho wanted his head rubbed. In
ten minutes Benjamin had learned
the trick and purred contentedly dur
ing the massage.
Benjamin Is reputed to be a full
blooded Dutch rabbit, and the Warn
ers say they have never found another
marked as he Is or half so smart.

OHIO COUNTY WHEAT
IS BADLY DAMAGED
HESSIAN FLY SAID TO HAVE CUT
CROP NEARLY HA.LF HAD
GOOD START.
Reports coming from many parts
of tho county say that the appearance
of the dreaded Hessian fly and Its
1 destructive work has cut this year's
! wheat crop nearly In half Early In
the spring It was thought that a
bumper crop would be raised but
many fields later appeared to have
, been burned over.
J Many fields of once promising
wheat have been so Irreparably dam
aged that they are being plowed and
planted in corn. It Is roughly es
timated that near twenty per cent of
'tho crop will bo plowed under. At
least thlry per cent of the crop sowed
last fall will produce no yield.
I Tho Hessian .fly is said to have
been brought to this country many
years ago. It Is thought that tho fly,
or tho eggs, were concealed In somo
straw during tho voyage, and liking
tho now country they at once con
tinued their life's work destroying
tho fruits of tho labors of man. Tho
egg Is deposited In tho boot of tho
wheat stalk and when the Insect Is
hatched It fells tho stalk. Tho fly
multiplies very fast and If tho wheat
I comes again after being destroyed
the first tlmo It Is likely to be at
tacked tho second time.

tioned. Chicago, May 23. If he will con
sent to make the race, William Jen
nings Bryan may be selected as the
candidate for President by the Prohi
bition party. Recent statements of
Mr. Bryan before the general confer
ence of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, at Saratoga Springs, In
which he Is quoted as declaring that
he had about reached the point where
he could no longer follow a political
party which refused to Indorse na
tional prohibition, was discussed by
Prohibition party leaders hero today.
They expressed the belief that If
the Democratic National Convention
at St. Louis declined to adopt a
national prohibition plank in Us
platform, Mr. Bryan might consent
to become tho candidate of the Pro
hibition party for President. The
Prohibition National Convention will
be held at St. Paul July 19 to 22,
and will be preceeded by a rally In
the Interest of the movement to ob
tain pledges from 5,000,000 citizens
to vote only for candidates for public

organization of the party under a nev
name.

tive Committee Is now being taken

PARDON DENIED.
Stanley Rebuke Ohio Co. Man. Who
Betrajed Step-daughter.
Frankfort, Ky., May 23. Montre
vllle Daugherty, of Ohio county, sen
tenced In 1912 to serve a term of ten
to twenty years for wronging his
step-daughter, was refused a pardon
by Gov. Stanley, who said, reciting
tho facts In tho case:
"Daugherty pleaded guilty to tho
charge of his step-daughter, who at
the tlmo was under sixteen years of
age. It Is Inconceivable that this
man could havo maintained such re
lations with this girl. He was n
loco parentis to her from Immature
childhood and should have regarded
her ns his daughter. Every Instinct
of nature and of decency should have
mado htm protect and not debauch
this young girl.
"It Is urged In his defense that sho
was a mature woman and possessed
of physical charms which torapted
the passlomvof this man, and that ho
was inexperienced and Ignorant. It
does not requlro culture or experience
to prevent the most stupid and illit
erate In tho commission of such of
fenses. "It is not to be regretted that the
record shows ho left a wife and child
ren, woh ate absolutely dependent.
Had he at the time of the commission
pf this crime any regard for his wife
or children, he would never have
committed the crime which he ad
mits. "I And nothing In his record to
justify me In exercising executive
clemency or turning loose upon so
ciety a man totally lacking 'la' every
sense of his duty to it", and for that
reason executive, clemency Is refused.

BOND ISSUE IS
PROPOSITION TURNED DOWN II V
VOTE OF OVER SEVEN TO
ONE.
HARTFORD YIELDS BLOW
Every Precinct In the County Gives
Large Majority Against the Im
provement of Roads.
Striking with an evident Intent to
kill the voters of Ohio County dealt
an awful blow to the proposition to
issue bonds to the amount of $300,
000 for the Improvement of roads
and bridges at the election Saturday.
Not a precinct in the county gave a
majority for the bonds. Contrary to
expectations in .many of the rural dis
tricts Hartford gave a large majority
against the proposition. The voters
in certain parts of the county seemed
to form an Idea that the county seat
would reap therSEteater -part of the
benefit from such an Issual of bonds
and upon that ground many of them
voted "No." Since Hartford gave
such a large vote against the proposi
tion, however, many of them are said
to be changing over.
The election was very different
from a political contest as very little
.electioneering was done by either
side. There was no crowd around
the polls and all was quiet. The
vote was taken and hurriedly count
ed, some of the ballot boxes reaching
the county clerk's office Saturday
evening and night. "
The election commissioners gave
out the official count Tuesday as fol
lows: PRECINCTS, Yes. NO.

Good Price For Hogs.
That farmers of Kentucky and
nearby Btates are getting back, Into
"clover" Is Indicated by tho receipts
of livestock at the local yards and
the splendid prices, being realized.

stockyards tbia , week amounted to
19,289 head, the largest In yean,
and prices havo been as high as $10
and have ranged between $9.65 and
$10 throughout the week.
Prices are holding the best level In
several years. Receipts of lambs this
week amounted to 6,035, the heaviest

season and fancy prices. Cattle re
ceipts are picking up at a splendid
rate. Farmers appear to be better
stocked with cattle and hogs than for
several years. Louisville Courier

'AMERICA FIRST'
ADVISES BISHOP
RT. REV. WOODCOCK CALLS FOR,
FINER PATRIOTISM IN AD
DRESS AT LOUISVILLE.
THRILLS HIS HEARERS -
-!'
Scores "Hyphenates" and "Peace
at-Any-Prlce" Propagandists at
Council Session.
Converts to tho cause of American
ism, full-blooded and virile, were won
If there happened to be any present at
yesterday's session of the Diocesan
Council of Kentucky and "hyphen
ates" or "peace-at-any-prlce" prop
agandists to hear the stirring an
nual address of the Rt. Rev. Charles
Edward Woodcock, bishop of Ken
tucky. The bishop thrilled hl3 hearers,
some of the most prominent church'
men In the State, with an appeal for
"America first" and finer patriotism
among Americans, regardless of poli
tical or ancestral ties.
Discussing conditions growing out
of the European war, the bishop said:
"The atmosphere has cleared a lit
tlo, but the clouds still hang low.
Knowing conditions, we can not look
upon these grave matters without
deep and anxious concern. But wo
are not all so inert nor yet so suplno
as to be willing to join those who
clamor for peace at any price.
"Surely, we want peace. We want
It so deply that, as a nation, we will
go the whole length of honor for lt9
maintenance, but we will not go so
far as to compromise our honor to
sicure a place which would terminate
in national disgrace. Peace, if WO
can preserve it but peace at Its own
price no matter what It costs is
the only condition 'on whtchTtoe ftro
worthy of peace.
"This Is no time for uncertainties
In American citizenship, either hyp
henated or political. American cit
izenship has but one hallmark and
that is loyalty to this land.
We need, In this hour American man
hood straight, full-blooded, una
fraid and undented."
Must Stand Together.
That portion of Bishop Wood
cock's address on the need of Ameri
cans standing together In a time of
stress followed a discussion of other
matters immediately connected with
the church. The country's best wel
fare, the Bishop said, depended on
our putting America foremost first
and all the time and preventing any
se of citizens of any nationality from
embarrassing our Government.
