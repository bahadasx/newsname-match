CORNELIUS ELDON HOLT
A hyphenated American plus was
born December 14 1877 at Dukinfleld
Cheshire England and was three
years old when tho family came to
America When of school age ho was
sent until he completed the seventh
grade At 14 years of age he entered
the coal mines and performed the
various duties of miner checkwelgh
man and mule driver During 1903 4
ho was manager of the Washington
ville Mine Supply Go operative Co
6n Nov 19 1908 Eldon IHolt and
Charles Snyder were badly burned in
an explosion of coal dust while per
forming the duties of shot firers In
the Peerless mine near Washlngton
ville Tho following spring he ac
copted the position of salesman with
the Leetonla Tool Co and for five
years has been Secretary Treasurer
and manager bringing tho companys
affairs up to a commercial standing
worthy of a place In Bradstreets re
port
On Nov 1C 1901 ho was united
In marrlagq with Miss iLoula B Prior
of Leetonla Ohio and to them five
sons were born four of whom are liv
ing so that the name of Holt is not
likely to be submarined during the
present unpleasantness in Europe
Whllo Mr Holt spends his daytime
at the companys office in Leetonla
his family conducts a small general
store in Washingtonvllle C E Holti
is a member of tho Evangelical Luth
eran church and Sunday school is
also a member of tho Foresters of
America and K of P lodges
Mr and Mrs Holt have a commend
able pride in their boys indulging
their playful exercises in the open
their schooling and their business
habits In tho store It would not bo
surprising in the not distant future to
hear of a Holt being as prominent as
a Henry Ford a Thomas A Edison or
a Woodrow Wilson
Since C E Holts connection with
The Leetonla Tool Co Its business
has Increased and extended and today
Is one of the leading industries of
that thriving village Tho superiority
of these tools is recognized wherever
used the high grade of the material
employed and the fair dealing on the
part of the company are soon mauo
manifest to the miners and operators
handling them In fact these are the
tools that made Leetonla famous and
get strong Holt upon all who buy
them The foregoing Is not an obit
uary notice but simply a truthful
goodwill offering

It is a placo for sad reflection to
visit an old and abandoned cemetery

to inhale the rank fragrance of tho
lilac Then to read the quaint In
scriptions Gone but not forgotten
or some qouted passage from the
bible or hymnal We call to memory
the once popular verses of Grays
Elegy in a Country Churchyard and
find them true
Nearly all of us iride some hobby
and hobbles like measles and small
pox must break out I will let mine
break out thru the columns of The
Mahoning Dispatch Here Is a ques
tion If playgrounds and parks are a
good thing for city dwellers why
would they not be equally good for
country dwellers The national gov
ernment recognizes the Importance of
reserving some parts of our domain
for public parks but why aro they
nearly all located In the West Wo
have 14 national parks In all with a
grand total of 7290 squre miles Chi
cago has over 150000000 invested in
her parks and playgrounds not includ

state park 280 acres The Ohio su
perintendent of public welfare said in
a letter April 17 Parks and play
grounds are as essential in the coun
try as In the city There should be
a law authorizing at least 80 acres
for public use In every township bo
that grange and township picnics could
be held thereon and country people
could compare notes and drive away
