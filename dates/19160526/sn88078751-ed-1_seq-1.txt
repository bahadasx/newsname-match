ESTABLISHED 1836
CARRANZA NOTE
NOW ON ITS WAY
Carries New
May Be
' Washington, May 25. Reports that
tteneral Carranza, in his proposals to
be made to the American government,
might In some form renew his request
for withdrawal of the American ex
pedition from Mexico were given
credence by some officials here.
Unofficial advices have reflected a
grave domestic situation in Mexico,
duo to labor and other economic diffi
culties, and to the menace of renewed
revolutionary activities. It has beea
suggested that under the circum
stances, the de facto government
might fear the consequences at homo
of a recession from the demand for
withdrawal.
There are no indications that a re
newed demand for withdrawal would
meet with immediate acquiescence or
lead to serious consequences unless It
were backed by an order for hostili
ties agaijst the American force. Offi
cials wero not disturbed by border re
ports that the de facto troops wero
moving northward in force, taking it
as a probablo result of the orders for
co-operative operations issued' after
the Scott-Obregon conference.
Tho state department's dispatches
from Special Agent Itodgers indicated
that the new note probably already
was on its way. He reported that the
communication was coming by special
messenger and should be In 'Washing
ton by Monday.
Further reports of disturbed eco
nomic conditions in Mexico reached
the state department. Crops were
eald to be in poor condition in many
sections and spring planting below
normal.. The de facto government, it)
was reported, had crushed the rail
road strike In most districts by sub-
lectins railroad workmen to military
rule and making them liable to court
martial for refusal to work.

Chicago, May 25. One man was
arrested and two city employes were
suspended as the graft expose in the
water department broadened until It
threatened to involve nearly 100 men
and $100,000 of tho city's funds.

department were promised by Com
missioner of Public Works Moor
house, who is conducting a searching
investigation of the graft. It was at
first believed that the amount Involv
ed in the padded payroll would not
Involve-more than $25,000 or $30,000,
but according to Captain Coffin of the
Pronosals To The

be "satisfactory."
POSITION GF ALLIES
IN NO WAY GHANGED
GrGy Says Time Not Ripe For
w
Negotiations,
VI
London, May 25. In an impromptu
speech in the house of commons on
the question of peace. Sir Edward
Grey, the British foreign secretary,
set aside all ideas that peace negotia
tions were possible at the present
stage and plainly reiterated that tho
position of the allies was in no way
changed. He declared that it was
impossible to consider terms of peace
without a previous agreement be
tween the entente allies. Further, he
expressed the decided opinion that
the hostilities had not yet reached a
stage where It was possible to talk of
peace, especially as the German pub
lic was constantly being "fed with
lies" by their ministers.
Grey In the course of his speech
characterized Chancellor Von Beth-mann-Hollweg's
recent statement that
Great Britain was prepared to go to
war over Bosnia as "a flrst-class lie."
The real reason for the prolongation
of the war was that tho German gov
ernment was continually telling their
people that they wero winning the
war and that the allies wero beaten,
said Grey.

TWO CONFLICTS

Retake Fort Douaumont,
LOSSES HEAVY ON BOTH SIDES
Repeated Attacks of the Mot Desper
ate Character Continue to Feature
the Great Struggle For the Posses
sion of Verdun Operations On the
Austro-ltallan and Other Battle
Fronts.
London, May 25. As tho result of a
practically continuous attacks on both
sides of the Meuse the Germans have
won two notable successes at the ex
penditure of a considerable number of
men.
In thei fighting to the east of Le
Mort Homme, on the left bank of the
river, they occupied the village of Cu
mieres, and took a trench between
the village and Le Mort Homme. On
the east bank, Fort Douaumont, which
me freucn recaniureu aionoay, was
retaken by the Germans.
The retaking of the fort was the
result of the concentration of repeat
ed attacks of the most desperate
character against this one point. Tho
Bavarian divisions, who had been
brought to the Verdun front recently,
were employed against the fort.
The bombardment of this sector
had continued without interruption
since the French took the position,
and had increased in violence, partic
ularly Wednesday afternoon, when
the already trenmendous expenditure
of ammunition was doubled. Even
then the first attacks broke down un
der the French fire, but the effort wns
repeated until at last they again oc
cupied the fort, long since only a
mass of ruins, but valuable because
of the high position on which it
stands.
While this terrific fighting was in
progress on the east bank of the
river,- both Germans and French
simultaneously took the offensive on
the west bank in the sector of Cu
mieres and Le Mort Homme, the Ger
mans attempting their advance from
the village of Cumleres, which they
had captured, and the French at
tempting to regain the village. French
counter attacks were successful to
the extent of recovering a trench on
the verge of the village.
On the Austro-Itrian front, the
Austrlans from the Lke Garcia region
to the Val Sugana district are keeping
up their violent offensive against the
Italians. Driven across their border
southeast of Trent, the Italians are
endeavoring to hold a fortified line
from Asingo to Arsiero and tho
heights east of the Val D'Assa. Rome
admits that in effecting their retreat
across the border the Italians destrov
ed artillery which it was impossible
to withdraw.

est Sensation
Mrs, Waiters, Ho it on and Miss
Harilvick Give Testimony.
CLIMAX IN THE WAITE TRIAL
Wife Calmly Relates Experiences of
Her Married Life, Whlje the "Other
Woman" Is Forced Only by Sledgo
Hammer Questioning to Make An
swers Miss Hardwlck the Mysteri
ous "K. Adams."
New York, May 25. Three women.
Elizabeth C. Hardwick, Clara Peck
WaitC the wife, and Margaret Weav.
er Horton, the other woman, brought
the trial of Dr. Arthur Warren Waite
for the murder of his father-in-law,
John E. Peck, to a dramatic climax.
Miss Hardwlck's part was a minor
one. She was the "K. Adams," whose
telegram had set In action the Inves
tigation which had brought about the
trial.
Mrs. Waite, the wife, calm, but re
pressing her v emotions only by a
strong effort, narrated the experi
ences of her married life, beginning
with the whirlwind wooing, and end
ing with the parting with her husband,
at the Grand Rapids station on March
17, when he departed for New York
city and a prison cell. Rapidly tho
Incidents fell from the lips ot thf
wife, the marriage, the talks about
money, the premonitions of the death
of her father, the action during the
fatal illness, the preparations of the
food, the fatal cup of eggnog, the
urging of cremation, the suggestion
that she make a will and the last let
ter received.
Mrs. Horton, the other woman, sul
len and self-possessed, forced only by
sledge-hammer questions to make any
answers at all, told of her three?
months' relations with the man, thelr
language lessons, voice lessons, dra
matic lessons, their "studio" at the
Plaza hotel, and then, almost In mono
syllables, of the man's confession to"
her. Then of his letters written to
her from the hospital and from tha
Tombs, in which he declared that ha
would not get the "chair," but an asy
lum for the criminal Insane, from
which he would return to her in a ieyf
years, and then, almost In a whisper; -her
reply to him that she would wait'
for him "four years or forty." Hf
Joking allusions to the "little man
from Egypt," saying she must laugh,
to read it, his telling her that lr shev
continued to love him it was all worUr
while, came Just as reluctantly front
her lips, it all concluding with he
statement that not until two weofca
ago, under the strongest pressure by
the district attorney's office, had shes
placed these facts in the possession
of the prosecution.
Percy Peek, brother-in-law, and son
of the man whom the state says waa
murdered, in a business-like voice,,
could add only one tense moment to"
the session, and that was when he
told how, with the "K. Adams" tele
gram In his pocket and the autopsy
already ordered, he had met the de
fendant in the station at Grand Rap
ids and quietly demanded the checka
which would put the body of his fath
er In his possession. In the clash, of"
wills the son proved the stronger, and
without a word of explanation began,
the work which revealed the truth.

Chicago, May 25. Hobart Williams
