DR, WAITE TELLS
HOW HE PLANNED
DEATHSOF IflANY
Dentist Held For Murder of
Father-in-Law Under
Sharp Grilling.
GROUND GLASS AND
GERMS HIS TOOLS
Didn't Expect As Much As
$2,000,000 By Death of
Father-in-Law.
New York, May 26 Dr. Arthur
Waren Waite, accused ' of murdering
his father-in-law, John E. Peck, to
day completed his gruesome recital,
unparalleled, i in the annals of crime
in New York.
Waite showed no emotion as he
answered the questions of his cross
examiners, and told with- "apparent
nonchalance of his plans for the death
of "Peck and other relatives; His tes
timony left nothing to be done
toward proving that he committed
murder. The question that confronts
the . jury was whether his aots were
those of a normal person.
Women were excluded from the
courtroom when Dr. Waite resumed
the witness stand today. Hundreds
of persons in the corridors vainly tried
to gain admission to the courtroom.
Waite appeared pale but seemed to
have braced himself to face the or
deal. His counsel, Walter R. Deuel,
said he had only a few more questions
to ask the dentist before the cross
examination will be begun. N .
"Did "you ever try to kill your
wife?" asked . Mr. Deuel. ''No," re
plied,Dr. Waite.
"Did you ever plan to kill her?"
"No, never."
"Youhever thought you might kill
her?" "I am not sure that I would
not have killed her," said Waite. '
Assistant District Attorney Broth
ers then began the v cross-examination
of Dri Waite. The attorney first asked
prisoner: , "
"Do you recall telling me that you
did not want your wife to learn of
your relations with Mrs. Horton?"
"No," replied Waite
Waite folded his arms and regarded
the prosecutor- as he 'denied having
any general conversation with Mr.
Brothers in Dr. Waite's .. apartment.
The dentist said he was surprised to
learn , that he had given a ring to
his . nurse. He denied .. also that he
feigned insanity in Bellevu or in the
Tombs or that he deliberately planned
a false defense or read books on nerv
ous diseases. . . , - .
Waite declared he -did not tell Dis
trict Attorney Swann and Mr. Broth
ers while in Bellevue hospital that the
"man from Egypt" had killed John
E. Peck. . ,
,"Are you crazy? asked Mr. Broth
ers. "I think not." "
"After, you took Mr. Peck's life you
oould not sleep, could you ?" v "I slept
perfectly," said Waite.
"You wanted to kill yourself, did
you?" "Yes." ' ,
"Why didn't you kill yourself?". "I
made a pretty good attempt, at it,"
replied Waite. i,
"You planned Pecks death to win,
$2,000,000, didn't you?" "No, not that
much." , "
The prisoner denied that he ; had
schemed to kill John E. -Peek as early
as last February. . , -
Questionsby the cross-examiner
were framed with the evident intent
to show that the crimes to which the
prisoner had confessed were of a na
ture that did not call for personal
daring. ,
Waite denied that his evidence yes
terday was devised with' the purpose
of developing a defense , of insanity.
Justice Shearn, before whom Waite
is being, tried, then took up the ques
tioning, and asked him if he knew it
was wrong to steal. Waite said he
did. ,
"You were a member of a Chris
tian Endeavor Society? You learned
it was wrong to take human life and
against the laws of God?" "I don't
remember."
Mr. Deuel then resumed redirect ex
amination. Waite said his memory
was notperfect, he supposed, because
of drugs. The prisoner identified sev
eral letters he wrote in Bellevue hos
pital and a poem, saying he. had writ
ten poetry for several years. He said
that when he wrote the poem he sus
pected that he was charged with mur
der. . -. -
Waite having been permitited to
leave the witness stand, Miss Cather
ine Peck, sister of the late -John E.
Peck, was next called. Mr. Deuel
said he wanted to corroborate by Miss
Peck's testimony the statements made
by Dr. Waite that he placed ground
glass in . her ' maririalade- and germ
cultures In fish that she was to eat.
Miss Peck said she accepted Waite
as what he appeared to be, and told
of giving her business matters to him
to look after. Mis reck smiled as
he recalled her narrow escape from
death.
"I ate some of the marmalade," she
said. "When I opened the jar again
I found it full of something like sand.
I, took It back to the store and the
proprietor apologized."
After answering other questions in
corroboration of Waite's testimony,
Miss Peck was expused.

Prof. James Atlas has purchased
from the Thomas P. Taylor estate the
property where his hotel and turkish
bath is located in Fairfiel '. avenue.
Papers in the transaction were passed
a few days ago. The hotel is a three
story concrete building erected about
10 years ago. It was built for the
professor and was the fl- - '-. building of
modern construction for business pur
poses that was erected in the neighr
borhood. It was first conducted as a
turkish bath establishment but later
after extensive" alterations to the interior-.

hotel to the business, '
Several years ago he Instituted a
cabaret show. ( The 'county commis

strance backed by the officials of
neighboring and local churches re
cently refused him a renewal of his
liquor license. Prof. Atlas then ap
pealed to the Superior court and his
appeal will be heard soon. He then
discontinued the cabaret and has since
conducted his hotel for men only. -In
speaeking of his purchase today Prof.
Atlas said ,i '
"It is my intention to ' conduct a
strictly "stag hotel here and not to
have anything that will be objected to
by my neighbors or anyone else.
Bridgeport has been my home for a

it is located. I expect -to make my

CHARGES PLOT
TO KEEP HIGH
PRICE ON COAL
Goddard Fears, Combine
Submitted Bids on Sup
plying City Fuel. ' ;
"There is no competition Here," de
clared Robert D. Goddard of the
board of education today when bids
were opened Jn the office of the board
of contract and supply for 9,000 tons
of eoalto be used in pjublic buildings
and schools next year. . The board
of education had advertised for sep
arate bids but the bids they received
and the bids received by the board
of contract and supply proved to be
the same. ,.
"It looks to me," said Commission
er Goddard, "that there is a corr.V a
ationamong the retail dealers to hfcid
a certain price ' There is riot even
a difference of odd cents pn any of the
prices This on such- a large quan
tity would make considerable differ
ence", v -
Commissioners John A. Hurley and
Louis F. Sehwerdtle were of the same
opinion. Dr. Robert J. Lynch, presi
dent of the .board of contract and sup
ply thought the prices were fixed by
a combination of mine owners and this
was what -brought ; the bds of the
local dealers so near alike - Com
missioner Goddard favored buying' the
coal in Bridgep'cJrt-. if it could be
bought to advantage, ' here, but he
said . he " wanted to save as much
money as possible for the city.
It' was finally x decided to - delay
awarding the contracts until Monday
to give the committee of the school
board more time to obtain informa
tion regarding an offer made by the
A. McNeil & Sons Co. Four dealers,
the Naugatuck Valley Jce Co., Patrick
McGee, Michael Hoffman and the
City Ice & Coal Co., bid the same, $7
per ton for egg coal. Other bidders
were a little higher on this size coal.
On the face of the bids, Michael Hoff
man appears 'lowest. His bid was
$7 per toil on egg and stove -ooal;
$7.25 on nut coal 'and $8 on nut to be
furnished in quarter ton lots for the
board of , charities.

Spra'gue Co. sent a bid but it1 has not
yet reached the hands of the board of
education and cannot be, considered
now.
The A. McNeil Sons Co. made a
proposition - that the school board ' is
considering. The board may buy coal
from, the firm's New York agents at
$5.25 per ton. The freight here will be
37 or 38 cents per ton, discharging 2ft
cents per ton and storage in the Mc
Neil blhs, 10 cents per ton upto 4,000
tons.; Commissioner Goddard figured
that alowing 60 cents . per ton for,
trucking and delivery the - cost would
be about $6.47 per ton. ,
. Members . of the board of contract
and supply thought there ould be no
saving in . this . arrangement. They
said they had tried it before. They
were in favor of allowing the school
board to try it if the commissioners
desired. It was finally decided to
postpone the .awarding of any contract
until Monday when the school board
will have more definite information
concerning the plan.

Designations and

ers Grant Them Much
Contested Rights.
First, Information To
Remonstrants That
They Had Been Trick
ed Come.s From The
FarmerRoyal Social
Club, Twice Denied!
the Right to Dispense
Liquor,, Succeed.
It was learned today that byi
means of the simple scheme of:
changing their names, five:
local clubs against which re
monstrances had been filedy
were recently granted liquor
licenses by the county com-?
missoners. The action wast
keptquiet and Attorney A. J.':
Merritt, who represented local'
clergymen who remonstrated,1
was surprised when informed
by The Farmer that the licenses'
had been granted.
.The names of the clubs
which received licenses are :
Akron club, formerly known as
Acorn club; Borough, formerly
known as East End- Longacre,
' .erly called Liberty A. C;
, formerly called Oxford,
ana Keyslone, formerlyna.me3
Royal Social.
The applications 'were advertised in
order to comply with the law but be
cause of the change in names the re
monstrants did not suspect these or
ganizations were the identical ones to
which objections had been made. At
torney Henry Greenstein represented
all except the Oxford club.
The Keystone club is a colored or
ganization but the membership of the
other four consists of white persons.
Aa the Royal Social club this organiaa
tion had - quarters on ' Broad street but
was denied a license by the commis
sioner because neighbors remonstrat
ed against the noise made by mern-!
bers. Then the club moved to Water
street and.uppn applying a second
time was again turned down.
The plea was made to the commis
sioners that negroes, have no place in
this city where they can - purchase
drinks. If they go into a saloon and
ask for a glass, of . beer the bartender
says , "it will cost you $1." They are
not allowed to -sit in cabarets and sip
cooling beverages. They pleaded that
they ought to be given a license so
they could gather and drink without
being molested. ;
The scheme adopted was copied from;
a plan -used in Hartford to outwit re-
monstrants. - The clubs held meetings
and voted to change their names.
Then new papers were filed with the
secretary, of state in Hartford and ap-,
plications were filed for licenses. No.
remonstrances were filed against the
newly named organizations within the,
time required 'by law. Thereupon
counsel for the five clubs went to the
county commissioners to demand li
censes. As no -written objection had
been1 filed the commissioners had nu
altennatlve, but to grant the licenses.
It was understood several months
ago that the city administration was
opposed to'some of the clubs which
had filed applications. The applica
tions were pigeon holed after a blan
ket remonstrance had been filed.
Meanwhile just before the last . city
election was held on the bonding
question, word was passed artvud
among political workers, that if mem-,
bers of certain clubs located in East i
Bridgeport, worked hard in favor of
the bonds, favorable action might . be
expected on the license matter.
The club members evidently too-lt
this advice to heart , for there waa
