Fire Causes Loss of $800.
Last Friday night between the
hours of 9 and 10 o clock fire
destroyed the small frame build
ing occupied by L. D. Kunkle as
a photograph studio. Mr. Kunkle
used the rear of the building for
a sleeping apartment; he was at
the picture show when the fire
started and none of the contents
were saved. His loss is about
$650, with $400 insurance. The
value of the building was about
$150; it belonged to the Dunn
Lumber Co., of Winslow.
The origin of the fire is not
definitely known, but it is presum
ed to have been caused by defec
tive electric wiring, that being
the first day the electric current
had been turned into the build
ing.
For a time before the fire had
burned low it looked as though
flames would reach the Putney
warehouse, just across the street
to the north. The M. P. Cousins'
residence on the east and the
Carbon City Lumber yard were
in great danger for a time.
There are no facilities for fight
ing fires in Holbrook and the lack
of them was very apparent dur
ing Friday night's fire. Some
protection should be provided
before Are destroys the business
section of the town. This section
would surely have gone last Fri
day night had the wind been
blowing as hard during the fire
as it had during the afternoon.
An Enjoyable Picnic
A jolly party of Holbrook peo
ple spent last Sunday at the pet
rified forest. More than 20 peo
ple drove out in automobiles,
taking with them a bountiful
supply of excellently prepared

salads, ice cream, cake and coffee.
After the feast target shooting
and other sport were participated
in by some, others spending the
time in collecting specimens of
petrified wood. Those who en
joyed the occasion were: Mr. and
Mrs. J. Frank Matthews, Mr.
and Mrs. Jesse Hulet and son,
Mr. and Mrs. Jay Patterson and
children, Mr. and Mrs. C. P.

Apache County Buys Truck.
A new White tractor truck,
purchased last week by Apache
county for use on the roads in
that county, was unloaded in Hol
brook Tuesday.
This machine is a combination
tractor, truck and road roller.
It is equipped with a six-cylin
der, sixty horse-power motor and
is so geared that it is said to de
liver over 200 horse-power when
working "in low." Over 4,000
trucks of this design are in use
and undoubtedly the next season
will see a number of them placed
in Arizona, not only for road
work, but for the hauling of
high, grade ores.
Coming Pastime Attractions
Saturday night the "Lure of

Taylor Club Defeated Holbrook.
The Holbrook base ball club
was defeated by Taylor club last
Sunday afternoon on the Hol
brook grounds by a score of
something like 22 to 9. The con
test was interesting principally
because of the number of errors
made. The local club played a
poorer game than it has played
at any time during the season.
Besides, the Taylor club is a
stronger one than any club the
Holbrook boys have met this
season, and after the second in
ning the visitors had everything
their own way.
The exhibition last Sunday
proves that a base ball club can
not play a winning game unless
it keeps in condition by practice.
The Holbrook boys had no prac
tice last week, and the result was
that thev were slaughtered in
the game Sunday.
A second club should be organ
ized here, if for no other purpose
than to give the first club prac
tice. Patrons of the game will
pay money as readily to see a
game between two local clubs as
between a local and a visiting
club. Morover, a second club
will put in training a number of
players from which substitutes
may be drawn.
The organization of a second
club should be encouraged not
alone by the patrons of the sport,
but by the members of the first
club. Without question all con
cerned would profit by such an
arrangement. The first club
would receive the much needed
practice and the patrons of the
game would have the opportunity
oftener to see a ball game.
Investigating Horse Disease.
Lew H. Mickey, live stock in
spector for Navaio county, re
turned Sunday night from Phoe
nix where he had spent several
days consulting with the State
Sanitary board in reference to
an infectious disease that effects
horses in this and adjoining
counties, especially on the Indian
reservations. The disease is
known as "dourine, " and is
supposed to have been brought to
this country by horses shipped
in by the U. S. Government.
As a result of the deliberations
of the sanitary board a strenuous
effort will be made by the state
officials, working in conjunction
with the government officials, to
stamp out the disease. Drs.
Dennis and Miller, veterinary
surgeons or the u. b. govern
ment, have been here for several
weeks, and Mr. Mickey has ap
pointed Will Freeman and Jesse
Dewitt to assist them in the in
vestigation which has already
been started in the vicinity of
Springerville and St. Johns.
o
Wild West Feature Coming.
J. C. Lathrop has secured the
producing rights in Arizona and
New Mexico for the celebrated
101 Ranch" moving pictures.
These pictures are famous
throughout the country for their
faithful portrayal of western life
and scenes; thev never fail to
draw a crowded house.
Mr. Lathrop will open his
tour in his home, town and show
his first pictures at the Pastime
in Holbrook next Sunday night.
A 5 reel picture will be shown
and in the language of Mr. La
throp "it will be the best ever."
Don't miss it.
Field Notes from the Office
of the County Engineer
All roads that are traveled by
teams are now growing dusty
and rough. This will continue
until sufficient rain falls to pack
the loose soil. The only excep
tion to this is the surfaced sec
tion through the town of Hol
brook which was constructed
some over a year ago and has
cost nothing since. The Keams
Canyon road, upon which no
thing but wide tire wagons are
used, is exceptional in being
better than the others.
But few bids are coming in
from the southern part of the
county for the contract work
now posted for that vicinity.
Work upon a large contract on
the Holbrook to St. Johns road
in the vicinity of Carl will com
mence in a few days.
Specifications for the different
bridges to be constructed under
the recent bond issue are pre
pared in this office and invita
tions for bids will probably be
made and advertised at the next
meeting of the Board.
Construction of the Taylor and
Snowflake bridges, which was
discontinued some time since on
account of a change in the me
thod of payments which was un
acceptable to the banks, wiil be
begun again soon. The material
and men are now ready.
Charles E. Perkins,
County Engineer.
Mrs. Jordan Hostess

Boquets of roses with their

At the close of the afternoon,

of honor with a piece of Indian
