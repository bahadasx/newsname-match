S
PEAKING of b.s troops, who
passed In grand review at
Washington at liie close of the
great war. General Sherman
lays:
It waa. In my Judgment, the moat
magnificent army la eiistence 5.000
men, in splendid physique, who bad
lust completed a tnarih of nearly
2.000 miles In a hostiln country. In
food drill, and who realised that they
were being closely scrutinized hv
thousands of their fellow countrymen
ana Dy rorelgnert. Division after dlvt
ion passed, each commander ot an
army corps or division coming on
the stand during the passsge of his
command to bo presented to the presi
dent, cabinet and spectators. The
steadineaa and Onnoesn of tread, the
careful dress on tho guides, the uni
form Intervale between the companies,
all eyes directly to the front, and the
tattered and bullet rlwn flags, fes
tooned with flowers, all attracted no
tice. Many good people up to that
time had looked upon our Western
army as a sort of a mob; but the world
then saw and recognized as a fact that
it was an army In the proper sense,
well organized, well commanded and
disciplined, and It was no wonder that
It had swept through thn South like a
tornado. For alx hours and a half
that strong tread ot the army of the
West resounded along Pennsylvania
avenue. Not a aoul of that vast crowd
ot spectators left his place, and when
General Sherman.
the rear of the column had passed by
thousands of spectators still lingered
to expresa their sense ot confidence In
the atrength of a government which
could claim such an army."
The statistics of the Civil war are
highly interesting in view of what Is
going on In Europe today. It has been
carefully figured out that there were
2,898,304 enlistments In the Union ar
mies during the war and approxi
mately 1,400,000 In tho Confederals
armies. Reduced to the three-year
period there were the equivalent of
1,556,678 enlistments in the Union
armies and 1,082,119 in the Confeder
ate armies. Tho Union casualties were
67,058 killed in battle, 43,012 died of.
wounda, 224,586 died from disease, 24,
872 died from accidenta and other
causes; total deaths, 359,628; total
wounded and recovered, 275,175. The
Confederates bad 94.000 killed or dead
from wounds in battle and 164,000 lost
by disease or other causes.
Great Occasion Recalled.
The men who paraded through the
streets of the country's cities and
towns on Memorial day do not ask to be
thought heroes. They are elderly citi
xens who In their day answered the
call Just aa their sons and their sons'
sons would answer It If it came today.
The country gave the command, they
obeyed.
What makes the parade ot these
men a great occasion la the great
ness of the occasion which it com
memorates. Every one of the vet
erana la a unit in the masa which
made up fifty years ago the utmost
atrength of the greatest republic on
earth, exerted to aave Itself from de
struction and to wipe out from It the
curse of human alavery.
It la Impossible to exaggerate the
Importance of the work which the
Union achieved for humanity or the
beauty of the aetf-sacrlflce which the
soldiers of 1861 made for the Ideal of
liberty. It could not be eaay for the
spectators In Pennsylvania avenue to
keep the tears from their eyes aa the
blue-clad ranks passed by.
All Honor Sacred Dead.
The entire nation lifts Its hat on
Memorial day to the revered doert-
the entire nation lifts Its heart to the
Almighty who made and haa kept the
American people a nation. The entire
country looks upon the wonderful ant.
