NUMBER 32
A " 1,1 '
The above is a picture of the
herd of young beef cattle shipped
last week to the St, Louis market
by Mr. J. S. Cavett, Their con
dition is the result of a fairly
complete experiment in feeding
young cattle for beef in this
county, begun by Mr. Cavett last
November and finished the 13th
of May.
Four of the twenty-eight
calves were two years old and
under, and twenty-four fifteen
months and under. Over twen
ty head were grade shorthorns
which Mr. Cavett had purchased
from Mr. Tom McHenry who was
greatly interested in the experi
mental feeding. These calves
in November averaged in weight
454 pounds; six months later
they averaged 764 pounds, show
ing a gain of 310 pounds or sev
enty per cent.
The feeding regime was as fol
lows: For the first two months
they were daily given each 20
founds of silage and 4 pounds pf
alfalfa hay; in January -they
were given cotton seed meal and
corn, in small quantities to be
gin with but this was increased
until they were given each 4
pounds of cotton seed meal and 8
pounds of corn daily. One im
portant factor was that they
were kept in what has been pro
nounced by experts to be as fine
a pasture as there is in the state.
This pasture is in the northeast
ern part of the Snowden place.
Bermuda sod with lespedeza,
white and hop clover and blue
grass, all growing luxuriantly,
make it an ideal pasture for this
section.
On Thursday, May 11th, there
was an " important gathering of
experts and cattlemen in this
pasture to inspect the cattle and
hear about their feedu ?. Lec
tures were delivered by Profs.
Ricks, Gayle and Carpenter of
the Mississippi A. & M. College,
who spoke respectively on Care
of Cattle in Winter, Feed! Crops
and Silage, and Feeding Beef
Cattle in Winter. Over a hun
dred interested men were in at
tendance and a good impetus
toward developing the raising of
beef cattle in Noxubee was
given. It was certainly made
plain that splendid beef stuff
could be grown here. ' .
The original cost of the calves
and their feed amounted to 1400.
The market was low when they
reached St. Louis, but $8.50 per
hundred weight was the price
they brought, which netted the
owner $200 over all expenses, a
profit in half a year of 331s per
cent. As this was an amateur
experiment the figures are most
encouraging.
In Tuesday's Commercial
Appeal there are a picture and
article about some young
beef cattle shipped to the
St. Louis market by the A. & M.
College. Figures are given and
the A. & M. men given great
credit for their achievement.
Yet Mr. Cavett's cattle, fed the
same length of time the A. & M.
cattle were, gained 310 pounds
on the average, while these
gained only 261 pounds each for
one lot and 282 for another, both
well under the gain of the Noxu
bee cattle. This advantage is
probably due to the superior
pasturage in Noxubee as the
feeding regimes were pretty sim
ilar, if anything the college feed
ing being more elaborate.
If, as the article says, these
college cattle show that Missis
sippi can feed and grow fine
beef cattle, that can compete
Xvith-any tifffli' ration, the wo.v
ubee cattle show that our county
can do a little better.
COMMUNICATED
Editor of the Beacon:
Regarding the following state
ment in the news columns of the
Commercial-Appeal and other
papers:
"The absence of boys' names in
the graduate list is due to the fact
that our pupils of that sex go to
colleges before graduation, as the
rosters of the students at Oxford,
the A. & M. and other collegia
will show."
I certainly appreciate the
Macon correspondent's attempt
to whitewash a condition which
is very embarrassing to me, and
which should be a matter of re
gret to our town. However, I
legret very much that the facts
in the case will not bear out the
statement, for the rosters of our
colleges will not show that our
boys leave high school for college,
though there may be one or two
exceptions which have come under
your notice and caused you to ar
rive at this conclusion. Four
years ago this year's graduating
class had five boys in it. Two of
these boys left high school to take
up some petty job and are
making very little more to
day than when they be
gan the work. Two others did
nothing for a year or two but
afterwards tried the navy. The
other boy I have lost track of.
Of the boys who have attended
high school and left frr college
you will lind as a rule that they
first completed their high school
course. . Three years ago we had
two or three boys to leave high
school for the A. & M. college in
the middle of the session, but they
did not carry ou their college
work for over a session or two,
dropping out before they accom
plished their purpose. AH of the
boys of that year's graduating
class went to college except one.
lie is, at present, taking a busi
ness course in 2s'ew Orleans. The
other three are still attending col
lege. Last year's graduating
class had four boys and they all
attended college this past year.
Of the Macon boys who have
graduated from the University
and the A. & M. college the last
few years you will find that
they all, with hardly a single ex
ception, had finished high school
before they went to college.
I have gone at this length in
my explanation because I believe
that the statement in the Commercial-Appeal
and other papers
may cause some to stumble. All
the records and figures go to prove
that those boys w ho consistently
pursue the course of study offered
by the high school until they
graduate from the high school are
the boys who attend college and
remain there until they have com
pleted their course. Our Uni
versity and colleges do not want
high school pupils who have not
completed the high school course
of study. They are not equipped
to give them the work they need.
The high schools can do the work
better. If a boy leaves high
school before he finishes the
course he should attend a school
like the Price-Webb School or
the Mississippi Heights Academy.
On account of the splendid disci
pline of such schools, reaching
the boy after he leaves the class
room, watching over him in his
home and social life, I believe it is
the best thing for some boy3 to
leave high school for them, but
under uo circumstances would I
advise a boy to leave high school
for college or university.
Thanking you for your kind
ness, and with best wishes, I re
main
Your sincere friend,
J. L. McMillin.

High School Commencement
The commencement exercises of
the Macon High School were held at
the Opera house Friday evening, May
19. Dr. Frederick D. Mellen, dean of
the department of public discourse of
the A. & M. College, delived the ad
dress. Dr. Mellen addressed his re
marks to the graduating class and the
youth of the audience primarily. He
outlined in broadest terms real success
in life, picturing it as attainment and
service, and then eloquently told how
it might be attained. He appealed to
the class that they learn their fellow
beings, saying that for success in life
we must study ourselves and others
and that without some understanding
of human nature it is impossible to at
tain distinction in any line of endeavor.
He then pictured the wealth that is
contained in books, and declared that
no life was successful that did not
learn to love and appreciate the wis
dom of the past, and that the reading
habit was an essential of great suc
cess. Although his advice was practi
cal and dealt largely with concrete
things he did not fail to dwell on the
need of spirituality and closed his ad
dress with an earnest appeal for the
members of the class to lead the
spiritual life aid to take as model and
guide the Savipr of mankind. The ad
dress was a finished, scholarly dis
course, well adapted to the occasion,
and greatly pleased the large, appreci
ative audience.
The medal offered by the Interstate
Trust and & Banking Company was
won by Miss Julia Holberg. Major E.
B. Boyd made the speech of presenta
tion. He took advantage of the fact
that a medal for general proficiency
was to be given a young woman, to re
view the history of woman's rapid ad
vance into the world of affairs since
her admittance to an education, and
with his characteristic eloquence he
paid woman a beautiful tribute, pro
phesying still greater things for her.
In delivering the medal to Miss Hol
berg he wished for her continued and
deserved success, and held out as an
ideal for others an attainment of gen
eral proficiency in all things.
. Miss Sallie Jackson won the Avery
medal for scholarship and deportment.
Rev. E. Nash Brovles awarded the
medal. He referred to the generous
impulse which prompted Mr. Ave.y
to offer the medal and stated that his
act was an act of real service for it
rauaod greater interest in school work
and raised the standurd of scholarship.
In awarding the medal to Mfew Jackson
he wished for her a life of usefulness
and happiness.
After a few practical remarks Mr.
McMillin presented diplomas to the
class, which was composed of Misses
La Perle Crigler, Dora Evelyn Connor,
Julia Holberg, Sallie Jackson, Wini
fred "Meeks, Virginia Morgan, Nannie

Food Supply Plentiful In Germany
Alex Loeb yesterday received a let
ter from his brother in Germany
which throws an interesting light up
on the war. The letter was uncen
sorcd in Germany, but was opened by
British authorities and passed intact.
Germany, according to the letter,
made the most abundant crops last
year that have been made in forty
years. The farmers haven't the stor
age space necessary, and there is
great activity in the building of ware
houses. Potatoes, fruit and hay are
made in plenty and there is wine in
superabundance. Business is satis
factory and money is easy. There is
profitable work enough for all. Peo
ple in the interior of Germany would
nov; know the war is going on were it
not for the newspapers and the return
of the wounded from the front. The
letter was written April 2 from Ung
stein, near Frankfurt-on-the-Main.
Mr. Loeb himself was born in Ger
many. At the age of thirteen he
heard the cannon booming forth the
first battle of the Franco-Prussian war.
"Of course my sympathies lean toward
Germany," he said yesterday, "and 1
know that the press of the country has
not been fair to the German cause.
Germany alienated the affections of
this country when she sank the Luai
tania. My only wish is that the war
were over, no matter who wins. I am
for the United States first." Meri
dian Dispatch.
Acute Rheumatism
Rheumatic fever, although seri
ous and painful enough, is not
feared as it used to be. We haye
discovered that salicjlate'of soda
has a specific action in this dis
ease; it relieves the pain, reduces
the fever and shortens the at
tack. The great danger in rheumatic
fever is its tendency to attack the
heart. But if. the salicylate
treatment is begun early enough
and pursued perseveringly, that
unfortunate complication may
usually be warded oil. In other
respects, the treatment is that
suitable to any acute fever, ex
cept that since there is no fear of
infection for others, it is not
necessary to isolate the patient.
, One the other hand, the pain is
so intense, and the patient is in
such dread of a clumsy hand or a
jarring footstep, that it is best to
keep him virtually isolated while
the attack is at its height. The
patient should . have the largest
and best ventilated room that can
be spared, and he should stay in
bed for some time after the actual
fever has disappeared. There is
often a good deal of sweating and
that should bo encouraged, for by
that means much of the poison is
carried from the system. The
patient should be given plenty ol
water, for that, too, helps to
eliminate the poison.
The inflammation is very likely
to move from joint to joint, and
the treatment for the local pain
of course moves with it. If the
pain is severe, it may be necessary
to protect the joint by a cage, so
that the bedclothes shall not press
upon it, or to wrap the joint in
layers of cotton wool. Some-

times hot fomentations give relief.
There are few illnesses in which
it is so necessary for the physician
to be coustactly watchful. The
salicylate of soda should be given
only under his orders, since some
people take it well, whereas others
react badly. Moreover, only a
trained physician can watch the
heart intelligently and vary the
treatment in accordance with its
condition. Youth's Companion.
