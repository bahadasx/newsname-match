IS APPARENTLY SLACKENING AND
DITIOIIS HAVE BEEN REVERSED
(Associated Press)
Gives Impression that he Would En
tertain Suggestions of Extending
His Good Offices ,
(Associated Press)
Washington, May 26. President
Wilson told callers today that the in
tervention of a neutral in. behalf of
peace in Europe could rest only on a
mutual- understanding by the bellig
erents that terms be arranged are to
conserve the interests of all, and of
the world at large, rather than those
of a particular nation or group of na
tions among the warring powers.
Mri Wilson did not disclose any
definite plan of action he may have
formulated in regard to peace, nor
authorize a formal statement of his
attitude. His callers gained an im
pression, however, ethat the president
would entertain suggestions that he
extend his t good offices to the bellig
erents to bring about peace only when
the conditions he outlined were likely
of fulfillment.
GREAT MAXWELL OIL MILEAGE
The item of cylinder oil in the op
eration of an automobile is quite an
important "one; it may be heavy or it
may be almost nothing. The claim of
the Maxwell manufacturers is that
the Maxwell gives the greatest mile
age of any automobile of its size and
weight manufactured. This claim is
substantiated by the daily records of
Maxwell cars in operation all over the
country. Oil consumption in pro
portion to gasoline is larger than the
average man realizes.
Mr. B. C. Webb of Kendrick, has
had a Maxwell car three months. He
has personally driven it every mile it
has traveled and has himself put in
very drop of oil and grease. He has
used exactly three quarts of oil and
traveled 1911 miles, a good portion of
which has been on hard country trips
with four and five passengers in the
car. The oil gauge is now exactly at
the same position it was when he took
the car, showing the same quantity of
oil in his crank base that it contained
at that time enough to run the car
500 miles without replenishing the
supply. . "- ' . 1
Mr. Webb says one cannot count
the oil expense on a Maxwell at any
thing hardly, and tells of a trip 'he,
took in another, part of the state, a
distance of 110 miles, in a car of much
lighter weight, on which trip the
driver added three quarts of oil to
his motor, a quart at each stop. If
this man traveled 15 miles to each
gallon of gas, which is probably his
average, then his oil will cost him, as
near as it can be figured, between a
fourth and , a fifth of what his gas
does, while with the Maxwell, based
on the record Mr. Webb reports,
which is not at all unusual and the
low average of 20 miles per gallon of
gas, his oil bill will only be, as near
a; it can be figured in even cents, one-
fifty-ninth of his gasoline expense. '
Just figure this in the course of a
year's operation of the average car,
12,500 miles and see what the oil bill
will be. It will be just $3 for the
year's run on the Maxwell and $51
for the same mileage, on the other
car, figured on the present, prices of
gas at 28 cents and oil at the average
price of 60 cents, at retail in Ocala.
This is only one of the many economic
features of the Maxwell car.

ROME BELIEVES THAT COII-
Two Thousand Are in Attendance on
Sessions of League to
Enforce Peace
; (Associated, Press)
Washington, " May 26. American
advocates of an international federa
tion to curtail war after the present
European struggle met here for the
first assembly of the new league to
enforce peace. William H. Taft,
president of the league and , Newton
D. Baker, secretary of war, are on the
day's -pro gram. President Wilson's
address at the closing session tomor
row night is expected to be a signifi
cant utterance. There are about two
thousand in attendance. '-'rA.. :.r. '
The subject of former President
Taf t's address was an explanation of
why the league's plan to form a fed
eration -of nations to use armed force
to prevent war without first trying
arbitration wouldn't violate the con
stitutional authority of the president
and Congress to declare war.
The objects of the league are to en
force peace and not to urge President
Wilson to take steps-to stop the pres
ent war, Mr. , Taft declared. The
league hopes, he said, for a world
agreement to make war less probable.
WAITE ON THE STAND
Denied Several Charges Made Against
Him and Said He Considered
- Himself Sane
(Associated Press)
New York, May. 26. Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite this morning denied
ever telling the district attorney
while he was in .Bellevue that the
"man, from Egypt" killed Peck. He
said he asked Mrs. Margaret Horton
if she ever heard of the "man from
Egypt," but denied that.he had other
wise spoken of such a character.
Waite denied that he ever planned or
tried to kill his wife, and also denied
faking insanity at Bellevue or in the
Tombs. He believes himself sane.
Waite told the alienist engaged for
the defense he intended to kill his
wife, Clara Park Waite and married
her only for her money, Dr. Morris J.
Karpas, the defense alienist, so tes
tified. He declared that Waite said
he didn't intend to stop at anything
to gain his end.
Alienists testified that Waite didn't
appear mentally well and was ab
normal in that his interests centered
on himself.

Barbed Wire Barriers were Thrown
Across Roads and Truck Train

(Associated Press)
Columbus, May 26. Animosity on
the part of soldiers of some Car
ranza commands along the Mexican
lines of communication has been en
countered by American truckmen re
cently, according to stories brought
here. Near Neuve Casas Grandes,
120 miles south of the border, barbed
wire barriers have been thrown
across the roads several times. Last
Wednesday a train commanded by
Captain R. B. Harper was halted by
a crowd in which were a number of
Carranza soldiers. The Americans
were jeered at and some stones were
thrown. No shots were fired, how
ever. The Americans proceeded with
out retaliating although stones struck

Dixie Highway" Association Busy Try
ing to Clear a Thru Route
to Miami
Word has come from official circles
of the Dixie Highway, in Chatta
nooga, to the effect that President
Allison of the association has just
completed arrangements for the last
remaining county between Nashville
and Chattanooga, which provides defi
nitely for the removal of the only
barrier .to through ; travel from Chi
cago to Tallahassee. The counties are
going to work and by fall the high
way will be open for tourists to come
straight through. V
There is still a barrier, however,
between Tallahassee and Gainesville.
Good roads must be had between
these places.
When the Central Florida Highway
Association convenes in Orlando June
22, reports will be called for on the
carrying out of the pledges of the
various counties to put their roads in
good condition. Where any county
has failed .to meet the pledges and to
provide passable roads, the route of
the Dixie Highway will be changed,
and the backward sections may lose
this great road.
Commissioner McRae was recently
quoted as saying that something like
50,000 automobiles were brought into
Florida by tourists this winter. Some
idea can be gained from these figures
of the number of motor cars that will
come through Ocala when the Dixie
Highway is opened.

AGENT REPORTS THAT COUHTY JILL CONTINUE TO LEAD I
GENERAL AGRICULTURE
"It looks as though the largest
corn crop in the history of the
the county will be produced this year,
and while oats were a very poor crop
the farmers appear determined to
have more and better hay than ever
before," said R. W. Blacklock, county
agent, U. S. department of agricul
ture, when asked today for his opin
ion on crop conditions in this coun
ty, ;.' '
"Taking conditions all over - the
county," Mr. Blalock said, " I think
that the farmers will produce more
beef and pork, this year than ever be
fore, and, with the better .facilitiel
of marketing promised, that they will
be greatly encouraged and that an
other year will find Marion county
still farther in the lead as a general
farming county."
Mr. vBlalock has been at work as
county agent for 13 weeks and is
pleased with the results he has been
able to obtain. ' '
"I have had 114 consultations in
my office," he said, " have written
338 letters, distributed 456 bulletins
and circulars, made 21 visits to dem
onstrators, 84 visits to corn club boys,
held 16 meetings, visited 164 farm
ers on their farms, and innoculated
609 head of hogs. In doing this work,
l have traveled 2456 miles by train
team and auto."
"The acreage devoted to general
farming is unusually, large this year,
and the staple crops, as a rule, are
ir fine condition. The farmer who
broke his land deep, and early, bias
without exception good crops, while
the man who neglected these two first
essentials of good farming suffered
r&ther severely from the drought.
"The peanut crop looks good, and
cotton is doing very well. Cane is not
up to standard at present, but is im
proving. "The truck crop has a smaller part
in the county's agricultural program
this year than usual. The late frosts,
and dry weather, caused all truck to
be rather late. The bean crop was
almost a failure, while the . farmer
who gets busy and plants another
crop on the same ground wil recover
part of his loss. The tomato crop is
fairly good, and some growers are
Leginning to ship. Watermelons and
cantaloupes have im'pioved greatly
since the rains and a good crop is
expected. ; . :
"The live stock suffered their part
in the late drought, but the copious
rains have made, a wonderful improv
me'nt. The amount of stock is steadi
ly increasing, and by the introduction
of pure bred sires the quality i3 be
ing rapidly improved." I find that the
ida of improving the breed is rapid
ly spreading, and I believe it will be
but afew years until the piney woods
hog and native cow will be hard to
find in Marion county.
"The hog crop is especially fine this
year, and if the cholera remains un
der control and the farmers will take
measures to prevent too large a loss
from worms and lice, the amount of
pork produced in the county will be
far in excess of any previous year."

THE iODIII
AT EUSTIS
Large Ocala Delegation Enjoyed a
Pleasant Day in the Pretty
Lake County. Town
. "On to Eustis," the slogan sounded
by Fort King camp some time back,
when the local Woodmen decided to
hold their annual picnic at Eustis,
proved its popularity yesterday morn
ing when the picnic train of teri cars,
carrying nearly three hundred per
sons, pulled out 'from the Coast Line
station. '
At the several stations along the
route at which the train stopped there
were a number of accessions to the
pleasure-bent throng.
Shortly after leaving Ocala the
picnickers were startled by a loud
noise issuing from the baggage car,
in which the degree team boys were
preparing the refreshments for the
trip, but as the occupants of each
coach recovered from their fright,
they were relieved to find that it was
only Jake Goldman, the first "news
butch" out, proclaiming the sale of
cold coca-cola. Jake was soon fol
lowed by other boys who dispensed
cold drinks and the other necessary
refreshments that go to make a picnic
crowd keep in a good humor and
spend its money. .
10:30 o'clock found the streets of
Eustis thronged with Woodmen and
their friends from Ocala and inter
vening points and the welcome that
was given them was one that . could
only be extended by a town that had
looked forward and planned to make
its guests feel at home from the
minute of their arrival, and in this
the visitors had to take of their hats
to Eustis.
As the people left the train the first
glance conveyed the fact that the city
was in gala attire. Flags and bunt
ing were in evidence on all sides and
the choppers were on hand to give any
directions wanted and to help the
visitors reach the grounds.
Talking about grounds the only
thing that can be said of the grounds,
Eustis city park, is that is was beau
tiful and its location ideal. With its
lurge shade trees, benches and other
conveniences it. is a place hard to
duplicate and one that brought home
to every Ocala chopper and citizen
present the need of such a place in
their home city.
At 11:30 o'clock, Sovereign Dykes,
postmaster of Eustis, called the crowd
to order and introduced Mayor Ken
nedy, who extended a most hearty
welcome to the choppers and their
friends. Mr. Kennedy's address was
responded to by Rev. Roy Bowers, on
behalf of the visitors. Although Rev.
Bowers is now a citizen of Eustis he
formerly resided in Ocala.
Following Rev. Bowers, Past Con
sul Collins of the Eustis' camp, made
an address to the visitors which prov
ed of much interest and in which he
urged all present not to hesitate to
name anything needed to add to their
pleasure. Sov. Collins closed his talk
by introducing a song of welcome, of
his own composition, which was sung
by two ladies of his city.
Consul Commander Lamar thanked
the Woodmen and citizens of Eustis
for their warm welcome and courte
sies extended the visitors and in so
doing made the local choppers "sit up
and take notice" as he had always
heretofore disclaimed any ability at
speech-making.
The program completed, Clairman
Dykes announced that during the aft
ernoon there would be a ball game, a
number of cars would be at the dis
posal of the visitors and the boat
would make a number of trips over
the lake. He then announced that
