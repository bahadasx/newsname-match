BIENNIAL MAY
PRIMARY ELECTION
BATTLE OF BALLOTS
I'liofficlal Returns l,ut Nearly Cor
rect Result of Recall
The May primaries passed off very
quietly, and while great interests
were at stake In the selection of can
didates, 1114 recall election overshad
owed all others. Considerable con
fusion resulted in making out the re
call ballot for tho reason the "No"
and "Yes" were marked but the
necessary vote following was over
looked, and the same applies to the
commissioner part of the ballot. One
would think, however, that the elec
tors of this county should be fully
advised us to making out a recall
ticket.
However, the election passed off
good naturedly as far as St. Helens
precincts are concerned, there
seems to bo a general desire to abide
by tho results. Sco tabulated re
turns elsewhere in this issue.
Fic tion Note
The neatest and most business-like
returns received was the report from
Ooble.
Judge Eakin received the nomina
tion on the Democratic ticket.
A. W. Muller received the nomina
tion for representative on the Demo
cratic ticket, over W. J. Fullerton,
Democrat.
Glen O. Metsker was the favorite
among the Democrats, and he re
ceived the Democratic nomination at
their hands.
W. J. Zlllman received the Demo
cratic nomination for county com
missioner.
J. W. McDonald had no trouble to
receive the Democratic nomination
for county clerk.
E. C. Stanwood received the Demo
cratic nomination for sheriff over E.
L. Payne, Democrat.
C. W. Blakesley, J. W. Allen, L. J.
Van Orshoven and T. S. White re
ceived the Democratic nomination for
their respective offices.
R. S. Huttan, county judge-elect
under the recall, will assume the du
ties of that office June 1. As Mr.
Hattan is treasurer, he will have the
unique distinction of naming his own
successor. "Jimmie " Hunt has al
ready been selected as his successor.
Mr. Hunt is a very capable man and
is familiar with the duties of the
office and the afairs of that responsi
ble office will move along without a
hitch.
As a general rule those who fall
to register rush In at the eleventh
hour. The registration law will never
be satisfactory until those who fall
to register at the proper time will be
denied the right to vote. In the case
of removal to another precinct, trans
fer cards can be used. However,
under the present law, those who
havo registered will not have to
register again unless a change of
voting precinct is made.

BRIEF STATE ELEC
TION RETURNS
Butchel for public service com
missioner carried the state over
Campbell by approximately 15,000.
Olcott's majority over Moores will
approach 17,000.
Hughes for president carried the
state by over 30,000.
Congressman Hawley had no oppo
sition and therefore received the
nomination. The same applies to
Justice Moore and Burnett and Dairy
and Food Commissioner MIckle.
LIVED ON MULE MEAT
Do you know that the kindly man
from whom you purchase popcorn
lived for nine days on mule meat?
His name is J. M. Hanson, and
here's the story.
In the Indian war in Kansas, in
1868-9, he was a member of the 19th
Kansas cavalry, under command of
Col. Crawford, who was governor
and resigned for service.
The troops were In extreme west
ern Kansas when they were overtaken
by a blizzard. T'.icir 600 horses
stampeded and onl' mule teams were
left. The horses were lost in tho
storm and their bones afterwards
found bleaching on the prairie.
Food run short, and although the
men were put on short rations they
were soon without supplies, and the
lame and crippled mules were slaugh
tered and the soldiers lived on their,
flesh for nine days. Mr. Hanson's
partner succeeded In killing a buffalo
and they made it into soup. He ate
nine pints and when it was taken
away from him he cried for more.
They were finally rescued by a sup
ply train.
This subject was brought up for
the reason that Congressman Hawley
has Introduced a bill which we learn
has passed both houses, granting a
pension to soldiers in all wars who
served six months or more. -When
this bill becomes a law, Mr. Hanson
will receive his deserved pension.
AT THE CIRCUS
A big circus will exhibit In Port
land shortly. We are in receipt of
$1,0 worth of advertising for $2
worth of tickets. Our waste basket
is full of such orders. But about
the circus. When a boy, we thought
the circus the greatest event In ju
venile annuls. Now we are not quite
sure of it. However, like the rest
of humanity we are susceptible to the
charms of tinsel and blarelng music.
When an elephant comes along with
a curly headed Hindoo on his hurri
cane deck, we pause In wonder. Then
the band commences to play, fol
lowed by the roaring of wild animals.
The clowns cause the front side of
our-face to open with a smile, but
when the girl comes along dancing
on a fiery steed, dressed in a blue
ribbon, with one foot at 6 o'clock and
the other at high noon, we make a
rush for the ticket wagon to get
ahead of the preachers, who always
wear stovepipe hats and won't sit
down In front.
St. Helens will be favored Sunday
with a visit from Bishop Sumner,
bishop of the Episcopal church of
the diocese of Oregon. He la a very
distinguished divine and St. Helens
is especially fortunate to be able to
hear htm. Services will be held at
Christ Episcopal church Sunday eve
