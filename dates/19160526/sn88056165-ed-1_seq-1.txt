Boise, May 24th.—The public
utilities commission has under
consideration a number of mat
ters that are regarded as of gen
eral importance. One of Jthese,
which has been submitted by the
3$0|hedale companies of the Cam
as and Nez Perce prairie coun
tries in Lewis and Idaho counties,
has to do with the rates of ship
ping from Grangeville and inter
vening points to Lewiston bv the
Camas Prairie Railroad Company,
and. which are said to be exorbi
tant. As the railroad is not al
together contained in Idaho, ex
tending down Snake river from
Lewiston to Riparia in the state
of Washington, the matter of
rates will have to be brought be
fore the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Steps to bring this
about are now being taken.
Another complaint of some im
portance that is now being con
sidered by the commission is that
of the Boise valley fruit growing
and livestock interests, and takes
the form of a joint charge against
the Boise Valley Traction Com
pany and the Oregon Short Line.
The complaint charges that while
there are local rates fixed on the
traction company line, but no
through rates for both the trac
tion and rail lines have been se
cured. The utilities commission
is asked to compel the giving of
such rates, as it is only in this
way that shipments can be made
with single bilis of lading.
The Oregon Short Line rail
road company has been granted
permission by the utilities com
mission to put into effect a rate
of 20 cents per hundredweight on
seed peas in carload lots from
Idaho Falls to Moore, Idaho. It
is claimed that the ground has
been prepared in large amount
at the latter place for seeding to
peas. The production of seed
peas in Idaho has grown to enor
mous proportions. In the vicin
ity of St. Anthony it is reported
that garden peas for seed pur
poses are grown on something
like 20,000 acres of land, and
that probably 5,000 acres in oth
er portions of the state will be
used for that purpose this year.
The claim is made that Idaho is
now producing the principal pea
seed crop in the United States.
At a meeting of the state land
board the report of the state en
gineer with reference to the
work necessary to the completion
of the Twin Falls North Side Ir
rigation project by January 1,
1918, was received and approved.
It is understood that the bond
holders of the original company
are arranging to provide the nec
essary funds for the doing of
this work with the idea that once
the system is completed it will
be accepted by the state, and
turned over to the holding or set
tlers company for operation.
At the state fair in Boise this
fall, the governors of Washing
ton, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and
Colorado are to be guests of the
capital city, according to letters
of acceptance that have just been
received. The management of
the state fair is arranging for
what is to be called a Governor's
Day, when a ssecial program will
be arranged in honor of the dis
tinguished visitors.
In change in the custody and
administration of invested funds

High School Students Hold
Commencement Exercises
This, the final week in the
present high school year, has
been a busy season with both
students and teachers and to say
that there has been something
doing every minute is not far
wrong. The local school is grad
uating a nice class of students
this year, five receiving their di
plomas after completing the high
school grades and eleven having
passed the eighth grade exami
nations successfully and being
entitled to enrollment in the high
school for the coming term.
On Saturday evening the pu
pils of the seventh and eighth
grades, assisted by some from
the lower grades, put on a school
play entitled "Indian Days" at
the Orpheum in conjunction with

it would be hard to select any as
being better than the other.

Farmers in the- vicinity of
Weiser are seriously thinking of
starting a co-operative creamery
at that place.
Farmers of the Genesee coun
try are seriously considering the
installation of a co-operative
creamery at that place. Between
5,000 and 8,000 pounds of cream
are being shipped from Genesee
each month and this is more than
enough to operate a creamery
successfully.
John Jenson, a former sheep
man of Soda Springs, who re
cently sold his ranch for a nice
price, has had warrants issued at
Spokane for the arrest of two
men whom he charges with hav
ing beaten him out of $9,985
through bets placed on horse
races at Great Falls, Mont.
At a meeting of the farmers
and business men of the Lapwai
highway district at Culdesac
Saturday unanimous endorsement
was given the proposal to bond
the district for $150,000 to im
prove the 77 miles of highway
within the district and an elec
tion to vote on the bond question
will be held early in June.
Another heavy flow of gas was
struck in a well being drilled at
Weiser last week at a depth of
420 feet and it is believed the
flow will prove of cdmmercial
value. When the gas was en
countered it threw water and
sand 75 feet into the air and the
pressure, when brought under
control, reached 80 pounds.
The price of $13,500 fixed by
the board of appraisers from
Lewis county, was accepted late
last week by the stockholders of
the Kamiah Bridge company and
the bridge has since been thrown
open to free traffic. The bridge
has been operated for several
years as a toll-bridge and a bill
for its purchase by the Btate was
put through the last legislature
but was vetoed by the governor.
Sheriff Yates, of Idaho county,
left late last week for Denver,
Colorado, to return Everett An
derson, who will face a charge of
being an accomplice of Ray
Prettyman in a burglary at
Stites. The two are accused of
having stolen a quantity of hides
and pelts from the Oliver ware
house at Stites and Prettyman
was given a hearing last week
and bound over to the district
court under $500 bonds.
J. P. Vollmer, A. E. Clarke
and E. W. Eaves, incorporators
of the Idaho Grain & Tramway
company and the Vollmer Ware
house and Milling company, filed
articles of incorporation of the
two companies at Lewiston Mon
day. The two companies are
capitalized at $50,000 each and
the former is to operate ware
houses at Kooskia and Stites and
at the head of the Kooskia tram
way while the latter will operate
the new flour mill and warehouses
at Vollmer.
Experienced timber men from
the mountain sections of Clear
water county predict a high stage
of water this year as a result of
the cold, backward summer thus
far. Snow lies deeper in the
mountains than for many years
and but very little of it has
melted out, while recent storms
have piled up new snow to a
depth of several inches. When
warm weather does come the
a
snow will melt rapidly and the*
rivers will no doubt reach very
high marks during the freshet
stage.
The organized forces of the
democratic party of Idaho won a
victory at Pocatello last Friday
when they re-elected Robert H.
Eider, of Kootenai county, as
national committeeman against
strong opposition. The rest of
the convention proved rather
tame and nineteen delegates
were finally appointed to attend
the national convention in St.
Louis, although Idaho is only en
titled to eight delegates to this
convention. The voting at St.
Louis will be arranged on a basis
of attendance.
Governor Alexander has filed
a protest with the public utilities
commission against the Idaho
Southern railroad removing its
track between Gooding and Jer
ome for the stated reason that
the road is not paying expenses.
The governor holds that towns
spring up and investments are
made along lines of railway and
that the railway company, being
the owner of a public utility has
no right to remove the same.
The question raised by the gov
ernor is a new one to come be
fore the commission and is liable
to attract widespread attention.
Letter to Parents-Teachers
The following letter addressed
to the members of the Parents
Teachers Association is being
published thiB week for the ben
efit of the general public and is
worthy of careful consideration:
"Parents, Teachers and
Friends.
"This being our last meeting
before discontinuing for the sum
mer vacation, it seems fitting at
this time to make a statement of
the aims and attainments of the
association since it was organiz
ed. There are now 30 members.
Our greatest need this spring
has been to bring parents and
teachers together to create an
interest in the movement. We
have had a number of readings
and talks, all of which have been
very helpful. With the start
that, has been made, next year
we should be ready to carry on
some line of organized work.
"In some places the associa- *
tions are making a study of such
subjects as "Child Study,"*
Birds," "Improving Civic Con
ditions," "Relation of Moving
ing Pictures to Education of the
Child" and other topi« that
have to do with child welfare.
"I trust that those who are
put into oifice for the coming
year may find interested co-oper
ation on the part of all parents
and teachers and that the asso
ciation may grow until it includes
all others in the community who
are interested.

have assisted in making the pro
grams a success.
