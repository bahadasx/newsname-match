Camp Harry J Jones

May 17 1916
To John F Weber Esq
Editor Graham Guardian
Safford Arizona
Friend John- It is now blow
ing like seven thousand fiends
and this little old machine is cov 1
ered with dust an inch thick i
good old Arizona dust At the
present time the tents of the
company across the company
street 30 feet cannot be seen
with any degree of distinction i
However it makes no material I
difference to the boys they are
all out now at different kinds of
fatigue work some making dobe
for the camp kitchens and in
cinerators receptacles wherein
there is burning a continuous fire
thrown thereby insuring a
sanitary camp
I think it well at this point to
hnkft vnn rhroiurh n riresnmA and
urday Afternoon
The Trustees Association of
Graham County met in the
court house at Safford Saturday
May 20th John F Nash Presi
dent of the Association took
charge in the forenoon Super
intendent S C Heywood pre
sided in the afternoon
Many timely subjects were dis
cussed among them the uniform
opening of schools and it was
decided to open all schools about
mas time of one week Care and
supervision of school houses and
grounds was taken up and it was
decided to make an effort to im
prove the same
In the afternoon Superinten
dent Heywood explained the
method of making out estimates
of expenses for the coming year
The matter of cooperation of
school districts in buying supplies
in order to get better prices and
lower freight rates was consid 1
ered and acted on favorably Mr i
Dexter of the McNeil Co Phoe
nix was in town and volunteered
to explain the advantages both
to the school districts and school
tedious resume of the companys latinpr library relative to school
actions from the time they left administration The trustees are
the fair valley of the Gila to be commended for the interest
The leavetaking is to you well shown considering that no pay
known that is the part which s forthcoming for their services
you who remained behind could i We bespeak one of the me3t
km what von could nntsfio successful school years for the
haps was the ache in the hearts coming year of any previous year
or most ot the boys as they saw
and felt the warmth and sincerity
of the good byes of the folks at
home
As we pulled out of the little
stationgoing we knew not where
we knew to a man that those
whom we left behind were send
ing their hearts with us and I
tell you those hearts are needed
right here That my friend is
to be one of the biggest things in
the campaign through which we
may have to go There is per
haps not a man in camp who has
not a picture of some loved one
some token of remembrance in
his watch or in his loose leaf
notebook where it can be carried
nearest to his heart And sir
those kind of men are the kind
who have something for which to
tight and who can not fail
the boys conducted themselves
Not once did anyone become
boisterous or make a demonstra
tion but at all times conducted
themselves as the utmost gentle
men A thing hardly to be ex-
marched to the camping ground
about a mile and half from the
depot That night under the
stars and the moon they pitched
their pup tents and sang the
while despite their fatigue
The next day the squad tents
were pitched a tent about twelve
feet square in which eight men
live and the kitchen tent put up
also the company street was
graded and cleared of brush
The boys worked like trojans and
in no time the place was ship
shape The next day the re
mainder of the regiment of the
National Guard detrained and
pitched camp beside us There
are now 11 companies of National
Guard in camp and it has a won
derfully businesslike appearance
too
The regimental street runs the
entire length of the regiment
from north to south On the
east side the company streets ex-
tend a row of tents to each com
pany facing north and a company
street in front of each about 20
feet wide On the west side of
the regimental street are the of
ficers tents facing their respec 1

it was a revelation to see how Infantry U S A from the
state of Washington encamped
adjoining this regiment on the

their members was shot in the
ankle with a spent bullet That
does not mean however that we
pected of an organization so i are in danger of being shot as
young or in fact of an that is the first and only bullet
tion of any age that seems to have fallen on this
The train pulled into Douglas side since we have been here
at about 730 and the company Each night however we can see
the camp fires and signal rockets
of the Mexican forces on the hill- i
sides across the line We by the 1
way are stationed about three
hundred yards from the line and

I came into the tent presumably for
Wilford s drinking cup to obtain drink
ing water for him Immediately after
the nurse It ft Cuptain Roach entered
i the tent and walking up to Wilford
i asked him how he felt Wilford an
jswered that he felt better Captain
I Roach asked him if he still wished to
go home and Wilford stated that he
i did Captain Roach then told him that
he would make arrangements for him
to leave for batiord the next
Friday May 19th

This appeared to
I After Captain Roach left he rose up
in search of drinking water Thomp
son said he then laid down on the pil
low and said he wanted to go home
the latter being addressed to no one in
particular Wilford then gave one or
i two groans and was quiet
A moment or two later the nurse
returned with the drinking water and
1 going over to the bed he noticed that
Wilford was still TJie nurse then said
the doctor must have given him some-
thing to make him sleep but Thompson
said that he believed he was dead
Thompson could not go over to the cot
where he lay but there was no evidence
of any buffering other than that given
above
On account of Morris complaining
of not feeling well Captain Roach had
excused him from duty At the time
of being relieved from duty he had been
helping in the labor of building a guard
house near the 14th Infantry handling
the material around there or mixinir
some material like cement for the
foundation This was the last labor
performed The very kindest of at
tention had been bestowed upon him
I got the information contained in the
last sentence from a dozen different
men from Salford who are in the Com
pany
Lieut Clyde Ijams Lieut Ernest
Wickerbham and Captain Roach went
with us to sec if we could procure the
body to bring home The military doc

Morris and told him it would not be
permisbiblc to hold a public funeral and
gave reans therefor
Fluid to determine the cause of
death was taken from the spine by the
militan doctor and State physician and
placed under examination It was then
pronounced that death w as due to a
very severe case of spinal meningitis
