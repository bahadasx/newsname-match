CHANGE OF SCHEDULE
ON C. 4 0. NEXT SUNDAY
BIQ SANDY DIVISION TO SUFFER
BY AN IMPORTANT
CHANGE.
In regard to the change of schedule
on the C. A O. main line and Big San

mation that the Big Sandy line will get
murh worne 6Vtl than It now haa.
The train leavlnif Ashland lor i ise
villa in the alteration will be changed
from four o'clock to two o'clock. This
a a verv unwelcome change ana one
which will cut heavily Into the receipts
uf the company on this division. At
present the Big Sandy division geis a
laxae amount of businesa iroro .moa
ners and business people who can go
to Huntington, Ashland or Ironton and
return to their homes the same day.
The new schedule will maKe tills im
possible, and only a small percentage
of these trips will continue, bocaase of
the expense and Inconvenience ana aia
inollnntion to remain away over night.
Huntington will suffer more than the
other towns. It Is difficult o see why
the railroad people would make a
change from the established ana con
..i..t arlicdule to one that is nbso
lutelv ununited to the needs and de
mands of the territory. It may Increase
the mall ordor business, nd If tne t..
x, rt. inrnrs to carry parcels post mat
ikf rather than passengers this sched
ule will help to do so. The telephone
and telegraph lines will take the place
of many round trips heretofore made
l.v His Sandlana.
It seems to us that such experiments
vnrv Ill-advised. The company will
certainly go back to something like the
old schedule, after losing money sou

RESULTS.
.t
Barbourville. Ky May 21. Natural
gas developments in Kentucky are in
creasing along with the unprecedent
ed activity In crude oil operations.
Large sections of the State are known
to be underlaid by natural gas belts
and with the recent construction of
long trunk, pipe lines to handle this
commodity, the Increase of the supply
Is being carried out by a number of
gas companies.
New drilling la proposed for the
Warren gas belt. Other fields of Im
portance are the Wolfe and Wayne
districts, .now supplying gn. for do
mestic purposes, and the Menifee and
Fleming county districts of upper
Kentucky. The high percentage of gas
oline In Kentucky crude oil Is leading
to plans for gasoline reduction plants,
several of which will be established In
Kentucky this summer.
The week's petroleum operations
show an unusually large number of
medium strikes and an absence of
well, approaching the gusher variety.
Seven completions are credited to
Wolfe county, the leading district. In
capacity from five to sixty barrels.
Oil operations will be started In Lee
county this week. W. V. Abney, repre
senting tho W. J. Gibson Company,
will becln drilling near St. Helens, and
Charles Eveleth, who Is assoclateaj
with a Detroit company, will start two
rigs In Millen Creek. Mr. Eveleth owns
about 3.000 acres and has about 4.000
acres additional under lease. The Gib

count of overproduction, low prices, In
accessibility and other causes, these
wells were sealed and almost forgot

the success of the Estill field have
caused the attention of oil men to be
directed to this field again.
