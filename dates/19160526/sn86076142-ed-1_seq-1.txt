man after an attempt to pass counter

employes. The name "M. E. Jones,"
was Tound on the tailors label of the

camp g he has been virtually super
Intendent of the West End properties
for the past three months owing; to
the physical disability of Mr. Chandjer.
In speaking of the appointment Mr.
Edwards said to the Bonanza this '
morning, "The appointment vof Mr.
Sherwin waa made after due considera
tion had been given the claims of two
score applicants from all parta of
the country and Mexico. Some or
these applicationa were accompanied
by bundlea of letters and recommen- ..
dationa but, after weighing 1I ele- ;
nients the directors concluded that the
best man for the job was Sherwin, -who
had demonstrated his efficiency
and ability since he nas been in the
service of the company. We are sat
isfied with his administration and
know him to be a practical man with
an absolute knowledge of mine con
ditions in the West End and Halifax
and believe the stockholders will find .
our faith has not been misplaced." '
Mr. Sherwin came to Tonopah In
1905, aa engineer on the Wff of the
Tonopah Mining company and the To
nopah Belmont under the .direction of
Frank tfelth who had charge of both
properties. After one year he went
to Goldfield to look' after properties
owned by the Philadelphia group of "
capitalists who were interested In the
Tonopah and Belmont Mining compan
ies. His next move was, to Los Angeles
where be made his headquarters
while engaged in examining proper
ties in both southern and northern
California. The desert appealed to him
however, and he returned in February,
1912, when he was appointed super
intendent of the MacNamara mine and
mill. In October.' 1914, be became as
sociated with the West End where he
made a record that Is largely respon
sible for his selection tor the position
of superintendent.
The appointment gives universal
satisfaction and Mr. Sherwin today
waa the recipient of many, congratu
lations which were all of a heartfelt
character. The opinion generally ex
pressed is that the company could not
have done better aa the new superin
tendent la essentially a practical man
and also gifted with a thorough acien
ttflc knowledge of the geology peculiar'
to the Tonopah district.
