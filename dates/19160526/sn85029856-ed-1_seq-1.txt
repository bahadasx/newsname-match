A PSALM OF THE UNION
God of the Free ! upon thy breath
Our flag is for the Right unrolled;
Still broad and brave as when its stars
First crowned the hallowed time of old ;
For Honor still its folds shall fly,
For Duty still their glories burn,
Where Truth, Religion, Freedom guard
The patriot's sword and martyr's urn
Then shout, beside thine oak, 0 North !
0 South ! wave answer with thy palm
And in our Union's heritage
Together lift the Nation's psalm !
God of the Free! our Nation bless
In its strong manhood as its birth ;
And make its life a Star of Hope
For all the struggling of the Earth ;
Thou gav'st the glorious Past to us; i
Oh! let. our Present burn as bright.
And o'er the mighty Future cast
Truth's, Honor's, Freedom's holy light!
Then shout beside thine oak, 0. North !
0 South ! wave answer with thy palm ;
And in our Union's heritage
Together lift a Nation's palm!

AUTO ACCIDENT
)A very serious auto accident was
barely averted Sunday evening when
a car containing Misses June- and
Stella Cox, Miss Leo Reynolds and
Miss Faye Adams, ran over a mound
in the road caused by a sewer pipe.
The girls were on Kansas avenue
near the high school when the ac
cident occurred; they didn't see the
mound until too close to either stop
or turn out of the way, so they did

ahead. Had they turned the wheels
