that the guardsmen would he tried

Majnr-General Funston has been In
structed to recommend its members,
a majority of whom must be officers
of the Texas national guard.
No Act ion I-.Im. where.
So far no steps have been tnken
toward prosci utuis- New Mexico and
Arizona guardsmen, who, like the
Texans. have failed U present them
selves for must or. A further report
from General Kun-iton regarding them
is awaited.
Secretary Raker tt-Hght issued the
following statement, explaining the
action of the war department:
The Dick bill provides as an of
fense the failure on the part of men
of the national guard to present
themselves for muster when called
upon bv the president to do so. One
hundred and sixteen members of the
Texas national guard are reported to
have failed to so present themselves.
I'nder the Dick bill they would be
guilty of failure to present themselves
for muster.
"When the pending legislation Is
approved and the militia of the states
is reorgarized and federalized there
under, the obligation of the enlisted
men of the national guard will be to
preserve constitutions of the United
States and their respective states and
the lawful orders of the president and
the governors of their respective
states. Thereafter when the president
issues a call to the national guard,
the call will of its own force muster
each member of the national guard
Into the federal service and It will
no longer bo necessary for the men
to present themselves for muster.
Covers This Cast.
"The offense denouncd by the
I'ick bill, therefore, will be impossible,
as it will not bo required that the
men should 'present' themselves for
muster. The Dick bill, not being re
pealed, expressly remains In force.
The 11B men in question, having
tnken an oath to preserve the consti
tution of the Cnltod States and to obey
the lawful orders of the governor of
Texas and not having yet taken an
Oath to obey the president as commander-in-chief,
must still present
themselves for muster. They are ca
pable, therefore, of committing the
offense in the Dick bill and are
horofure liable to punishment.
I have decided to have the court- I
martial assembled by command of the
president and have asked General
Funston to recommend the members
thereof. While I shall not prescribe.
1 shall bo Inclined to recommend that
the proceedings bo abated In cases
wnere the men are willing to take the
oath.
LLOYD GEORGE IS
MAN OF THE HOUR
Step. Into III each in Pacifier in Irish
Trouble. Will Head Con
ference. LONDON', May 25. David Lloyd
George, stepping temporarily from the
ministry of munitions to a sort of
round table conference to settle the
Irish difficulty, is a striking illustra
tion of how at all .he great crises and
emergencies during the war this
statesman has come to the front as
u stong man and savior of the
country.
Now he steps Into the breach to
solve one of ihe most difficult politi
cal problems ever presented to Brit
ish statesmen to reconcile the ap
parently irreccncilaole section of the
Irish people and estuldish home rule
in Ireland. How Lloyd George will be
able to arrange a formal conference
and exactly what thupe the confer
nee will take is still unknown. He
has been enraged for some days in in
formal talks preparatory to such a
conference and it is understood that
besided John Kedmotid. the Irish Na
tionalist, leader, and Kir Kdward Car
son, the I'lsier leader, the conference
will include Herbert Samuel, the home
secretary, who had much to do with
framing the finance clauses of the
home rule tct. Other names men
tioned are John Dillon and Joseph
Devlin. It is asserted the proceedings
of the conference will be quite confi
dential and that the place of meet
ing will be Lloyd George's private
room at the ministry of munitions In
Whitehall atrtet.
In the parliamentary lobbies today
feeling of optimism prevailed that
the cltcumatances under which the
parties are being called together of
fer a, fair chance of settlement.
WACKKOAN, III.. May 25. Mr.
and Mrs. K. O. Orpet, parents of Will
H. Orpet, University of Wisconsin stu
dent, on trial charged with the mur
der of Marian Uimbert, a former
sweetheart, and Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Lambert, parents of the dead girl,
have been subpoenaed as witnesses,
respectively, by the stale and the de
fense, it was revealed at the trial
today. About hundred persons in all
have been subpoenaed.
The state in Its subpoena ordered
the Orpets to bring into court all cor
respondence received by them from
their son which had been mailed at
Madison, Wis., between November 1.
1915, and February 11. 1916. iitad
particularly a special delivery letter
received by them February 9. 10 or
11, 1916.
Through the Lamberts the defense
will endeavor to prove that Marian
was in a nervous condition a few days
before she was found dead. The Ijun
bert family history also will be gone
Into, it was said, to learn if there is
a possible strain of suicidal mania.
Progress in tha selection of a jurv
from among the business men of
Waukegan and l.uke Forest fared no
better than it has during the week
from amonk Lake county farmers.
Only four Jurors have been sworn in.

House of Commons Unites
in Seeking Settlement of
Domestic Trouble.
MR. ASQUITH SPEAKS
Announces Lloyd (Jcorge
Has Undertaken Task of
Bringing Peace.
LONDON, May 25. The house of
commons has rarely seen a
demonstration of greater unity than
was displayed this afternoon when the
leaders of all factions flocked to the
standard of the prime minister in an
effort to achieve a lasting settlement
of the Irish question. This was the
more remarkable because a heated and
acrimonious debate it had been pre
dicted would follow Premier Asquith's
expected statement regarding the sit
uation and the government's proposals
for a solution of the problem, Mr.
Asquith's speech took an unexpected
turn for instead of giving details he
made an earnest plea for the set lie
ment of the Irish question by agree
ment among tho contending parties in
Ireland and announced that David
Lloyd George had undertaken the
delicate tusk of bringing the hostile
factions together.
The premier concluded with an an
peal that for a time all debate on the
question both In the house of com
mons and outside be suspended In view
of tho adverse effect such argument

All Airrrp.
John Redmond, the Nationalist
leader, acquiesced In the premier's
request, aiming In a voice tilled with
emotion his ardent desire for a solu
Mom of the difficulties of his country.
Mr. iceomona was quickly followed
by his political arch enemy, Kir Kd
ward Carson, who tendered his sup
port to the proposition and by the In
dependent Irish leader, William
O'Brien, who did likewise. The speches
effectively obliterated party lines for
the moment and those members who
had come prepared to attack the gov
ernment fell In with the leaders und
the question was dropped.

OKLAHOMA CITY'. May 2.1.
Fewer mines are in operation in tho
state at tills time than last year at
the same time, in tho opinion of Fd
gur Kenton, president of the state fed
eration of labor, who has returned
from a tour of the mining districts.
This means that a large number of
men are out of employment, and will
likely remain so durin,' the remainder
of the summer. Mr. Kenton says that
many industries have quit using coal
and installed gas or use crude oil lor
steam purposes, and this has reduced
the use of coal In a great measure.
In some places operation of mines has
become too expensive for any profit,
and some of them have been closed.
However, there is no labor trouble of
any kind in Oklahoma labor condi
tions in the coal field are not worse
than they have been in the past.

will expect to complete its work in
three days.

Bin; I. IN. May 24. via London. May
2Ti. (7:lt a. m., delayed). A
wireless dispatch from the United
Slates, giving t lie sub-jtaneo of Pres
ident Wilson's speech at Charlotte,
N. C, In which ho referred to the
possibility of American mediation In
the war, Is given the place ot honor
in the morning papers. Tho after
noon editions return to the subject
and their comments, together witn
tho wide interest shown by the Ger
man public show how importunt this
news is regarded here.
Though not definitely stated, there
is Utile doubt that Hermany Is will
ing to consider a tender of good of
fices to inaugura'u peace negotia
tions. The former attitude in the
highest quarters that America had
lisouallfied herself us a peace media
tor on account of shlninents of muni
tions to the allies has now changed.
If 1'esldcnt Wilson tan hold out any
tangible possibilities that peace may
result through his mcdintion. Oermuny
will undoubtedly be willing to consid
er such suggestions as he may, offer.
Must Hay lo Allies.
The receptive attitude is naturally
subject to tlie condition thut Oermuny
must not be Jockeyed into a position
of announcing her readiness to accept
President Wilson's good offices only
to find the allies later rejecting the
tender and asserting thut Oermuny is
suing for peace. There is equally
little doubt that the great masses of
people, uslde from the professional
hotspurs in the newspaper offices,
would willingly see America in the
rolo of a peace Intermediary, despite
tlie persisting bitterness over the
munitions (piestlons.
Forget Obi Orudge.
As a matter of fact, little is heard
nowadays either from the general
public or from tho press on the sub
ject of American shipments of arms.
I he iniestion seemed to have been sub
merged by other problems of exist
ence, which arc ot immediate import
li nee.
President Wilson s declaration can
not bo said, however, to have mude
a good Impression in Oermuny us fur
as the so-called "urmor plate" news
papers like tho Tages Zeitung and
Taglische Rundschau, are concerned.
Other Chauvinist organs take occas
ion to remember President Wilson
with bitter und uncomplimentary
phrases and even a moderate paper
liko the Lokul Anzeiger, declared thut
I he president should first demonstrate
the impartiality of his neutrality by
making good his demands for respect
for Amcrlcuu rights against England.
He would then have un excellent
change, says this paper, of succeeding
in his peace measure as far us Ger
many is concerned, i ne rumors of
mediation have affected the Iterll .
slock market. "War babies" which
have been generally weak, dropped
lower still on reports that America,
and other neutral countries were con
templating u tender of their good of
fices as peace mediators. At the same
timu "peace slocks" such as shipping
und colonial securities, uro in strong
demand.
