Amounts. C. E. Peterson Made
a Director.
A large amount of business was
transacted at the general meeting of
the Commercial Club Tuesday night.
While there was only a small at
tendance, a majority of the directors
were present.
One of the important actions tak
en was that the club decided to incor
porate the organization. Charles E.
Peterson was duly sworn in as a
member of the Board of Directors
to succeed J. P. Mclntyre who resign
ed a short time ago. A vote of
thanks was extended Mr., Mclntyre
for his work while a member of the
Board.
The club also decided that Decor
ation Day should be observed in the
city and will ask all business houses
to close f or half a day. All of the
business men present at the meeting
expressed their willingness to close
on that day.
Plans for entertaining the members
of the Civic & Commerce Association
Trade tour, who will be here on Wed
nesday, June 7th, were discussed by
the club. Arrangements will be made
to have the band out on that day to
meet the train and for a local speak
er to deliver an address of welcome.
Following this program, the visitors
will be taken in automobiles to points
of interest in the agricultural dis
tricts, both on the bench and in the
irrigated section in the valley on the
south side of the river.
The visiting school teachers* who
come here t his summer to attend the
Tri-county institute will be given ev
..'ery assistance by the club. A list of
-/all rooms available in the.city will
be compiled by Secretary Moore, and
when the teachers arrive in the city
the club will direct them to suitable
rooms and will render them such as
sistance as is necessary to get them
conveniently located without loss ot
time. An automobile ride for the
teachers is being planned for some
day during the time they are in the
city and other entertainment will also
be provided.
The question of the band also came
up for discussion and it was decided
that the business men of the club
who feel that they can do so are go
ing to subscribe a monthly amount to
be paid to the band to defray the
expenses of music, etc.

Locals Won Game in One Inning
With Four Runs.
MEANS FANS SEVENTEEN
Indian Pitches in Fine Shape. Spauld
ing Held Opponents to Three
Hits.
Glasgow won, and Poplar lost. And
the tragedy all occurred in the fatal
third inning when the local Cobbs and
Speakers landed on the ball for a total
of four runs, all they secured during
the entire game, but yet enough to
win by a safe margin.
Sunday's game between the locals
and Poplar was the first real tost
of the caliber of the home team. True,
the Trainmen and Nashua had been
vanquished, but in Means, the Indian
pitcher for Poplar, the aspirants for
batting honors were given a severe
set back.
When it comes to a ball team, Poplar
has Means. And the big Indian was
the whole show Sunday. Seventeen
Glasgow batsmen went down by the
strikeout route and many of them took
three healthys without even locating
the vicinity of the pill. Means had
everything, and he used it to good ad
vantage, but despite his big number
of strikeouts, seven hits were made
y the locals.
For Glasgow, Jack Spaulding did
the mound work and never during the
game was he in any real danger.
Nine Poplarites fell victims to his
puzzling offerings and only three
managed to connect for safeties. Jack
was never forced to exert himself and
in almost every inning the opposing
batters went down in one, two,
three order.
In the third inning, Means met his
Waterloo. Hurly started the fire
works with a single, Spaulding was

HILL REPORTED SERIOUSLY ILL
James J. Hill, railroad builder and
capitalist has been ill at his home in
St. Paul for the last week.
First reports of Mr. Hill's indisposi
tion stated that it was a minor char
acter and that the "empire builder"
expected to resume his customary ac
tivities within a very short time. Re
ports today, however, were that some
complications had developed and that
Mr. Hill's recovery was not progress
ing so rapidly as desired.
TRAINMEN WIN
Hinsdale went down to defeat Sun
day at the hands of the B. of R. T.
team. Hocking pitched 5 innings for
the Trainmen and only one run was
made while he was in the box. "Peer
less" Johnny Gritz finished the game
which ended 13 to 4 in favor of the
B. of R. T. The game was called in
the 7th inning because the Trainmen
knocked all the balls out of the lot

Memorial Day Services Will
Be Held at Orpheum Theatre
Decoration Day, Tuesday, May 30th,,
will be appropriately observed In '
Glasgow. j
An unusually fine program has been
arranged for the one day in the year
that has been set aside for honoring
the memory of the men who gave up j
their lives that this nation might re- ;
main the greatest power on earth, and
every patriotic citizen should take
part in the exercises on Tuesday af
ternoon.
Memorial services will be held in

Civil and Spanish-American wars, and
widows, and sons and daughters of

beet seed
Farmers May Obtain Free Sugar
Beet Seed Here.
CO-OPERATION IS URGED
Successful Growth and Tests Will
Hasten Coming of Beet Factory.
Time to Act Now.
The Commercial Club still has a
considerably amount of sugar beet
seed on hand which it desires to place
with farmers in the irrigated distrct
along the Milk river. Letters have
been sent out to farmers, as well as
notices having appeared in all of the
papers, stating that sugar beet seed
can be had free of charge by calling
for it at the office of the club.
It is necessary that this seed be
sown within the next 15 days in order
to insure satisfactory growth of the
beets to full maturity, and farmers
should be willing to grow the seed
in order to demonstrate that this is
a des : rable location for a sugar beet
factory. The increased value of land
as a result of a sugar beet factory
being located in this section of the
state should appeal to every farmer,
so that it should not be necessary
to be coaxed to assist in this work.
If this seed is not called for with
in the next few days it is planned by
the club to carry it out to the farm
ers and ask them to grow it.
The Commercial Club is doing ev
erything within its power to develop
and increase the value of farm land
in the Glasgow territory and in order
to continue this work, a committee
will start out the first of the week
and distribute the seed that is left
to those farmers who are willing to
co-operate in helping to make their
own land more valuable.
Every farmer who has land in the
valley that will be under irrigation
should be willing to grow a small
amount of sugar beets to prove that
his land is the kind of soil that will
make a sugar beet factory possible.
The recent rains have put the soil
in first class condition for planting
sugar beet seed and every effort
should be made by the farmers to get
their share during the next week and
get it in the ground so that it can
take advantage of the moisture.
