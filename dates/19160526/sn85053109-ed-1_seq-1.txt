Ask that Railway
Build a Viaduct
Residents Noith of Track
Have Petition Pray
ing for Relief
A petition, originating among
residents on the north side of
the tracks, asking that the
Great northern open up Broad
way street or construct a via
duct is now being circulated.
We fear that the prayer of the
petitioners will not be heeded,
although it must be granted
that they should have some re
lief from present conditions.
We should be more in favor of
a bridge over the tracks, some
where between the elevator
sites and the coal sheds. That
would also afford relief to
farmers in the north country,
whose patience is sorely tried
by having to wait at the eaat
crossing while long freights and
switching crews block the
crossing. This state of affairs
is growing more intolerable daily
and a move should be made to
remedy the condition.

"The Other Side"
The Pioneer Press has re
ceived a communication from
a Washington resident who is
well known and has business
interests here. This man pays
his respects to the Montana or
ganization that is publishing
reports to the effect that
Washington is suffering as a
result of prohibition enactment
whereby that state is minus
saloons. He declares that nev
er in the state's history has
prosperity been more wide
spread and the people more in
dustrious and happy than
since the state weht "dry."
He has arranged for the pur
chase of space in this paper and
will submit clippings from
Washington papers to prove
his contentions.
In Re Late Seasons
The Sweet Grass Advocate of
last week contained an inter
view with P. J. McDermott of
West Butte and P. H. Buckley,
the sheep king of the north
hills. These gentlemen fell
into a reminiscent mood con
cerning weather conditions in
Montana, past and present.
Their conversation went back
to the spring of 1902 and both
agreed that beside it the weather
this spring has been altogether
tropical. A big blizzard hit
this section that spring on the
16th day of May and snow fell
to a depth of several feet.
Thousands of ewes and lambs
perished in this big blizzard and
many of the cattle companies
were put out of business.
The editor of the Pioneer
Press recalls a description of
that big storm, given him by
Mr. Buckley, who declared that
the weather following this
storm was ideal and that the
year proved one of the most
favorable ever seen in this part
of Montana.

Lane Sobs Again
Senator Lane of Oregon, who
never misses a chance to re
lease a sob for Lo, made a
little talk in the Senate the
other dav concerning the piteous
state of the Indians on the
Blackfeet. He declared that
they were starving, going blind,
and that 60 per cent were tuber
cular. We are mindful of the
fact that there is poverty on
the Reservation, but we are
certain that the Oregon senator
is, as usual, exaggerating. Mr.
Lane, being a morose and me
lancoly character by tempera
ment, dearly loves to spread
gloom through the classic halls
of the Senate.

Northern Montana
Has Gone IV et;
Great Rejoicing
Northern Montana has gone wet—not boozelogi
cally any more than usual, ^ut meteorlogically—as
the weather man would say.
For two days this section has seen nothing but
heavy, low-hanging clouds that are sending down a
mixture of moisture; first rain, then snow, then rain
again.
Sod and cultivated soil are thoroughly saturated.
Farmers say there's enough moisture to keep the crops
booming until the early part of July. Everyone is in
high glee over the splendid outlook.
About twenty power outfits and dozensof horse
drawn breaking outfits have been at work in this
community, turning over the virgin sod. These out
fits will resume work with renewed spirit and hun
dreds of acres of flax will be sown on the sod. An
other successful crop year is almost assured.
The total rainfall for May is 1.38

of the school was crowded

without notes, a refreshing
departure from previous oc

by Attv. John W. Coburn, a

presented the diplomas to
the graduates in a very neat

Big Homestead Provisions
The principal provisions of
the proposed new homestead
law which will permit the filing
upon 640 acres of land in the
so-called public lands of the
states, which will be operative
only in Montana, Wyoming,
Idaho, North and South Dakota,
Washington and Oregon, are as
follows:
The land susceptible to entry
under its provisions must be
that designated by the secretary
of the interior as chiefly valu
able for grazing and the pro
duction of forage crops and
any person possessing home
stead rights may take advantage
thereof. Preference rights may
be secured by the presentation
of an application accompanied
by a petition for designation.
While residence on the land
is required, cultivation is not.
In lieu of cultivation, however,
improvements to the amount
of S1.25 an acre must be made.
In case a person has heretofore
made a homestead entry, this
may be augmented, provided
the total does not exceed 640
acres, and further that the two
tracts are within a radius of 20
miles. Again, one who has
filed under the existing law
may relinquish and make a
new filing embracing 640 acres.
Not An Arrest in
Week-End Today
Chief of Police Hurst De
clares this Year to be
Light for Police
Not an arrest in the past week
has been recorded on the doc
kets of the East Grand Forks
police department, according to
Chief of Police A. Hurst.
"Old residents tell me that
never in the history of the
town have there been so few
arrests at this season of year.
Seeding is in progress and with
it generally a large horde of
working men come here in
search of work. With them
come the hobo and pilfering ele
ment. The working men are
here but the hobo has been
eliminated by the passing of
the saloons," declared the chief.

Flax Looks Like
A Promising Crop
So Says a Writer in Boze
man School. Flax
is the Thing
Bozeman, May 19,— "Flax is
a promising crop for 1916." says
Professor Alfred Atkinson of
the Montana State college.
"Reports show that for the
years 1914 and 1915 the United
States produced about half of
the flax used by the flax con
suming industries of this coun
try. This deficiency has been
made up by flax importations
from Argentina chiefly. Pre
vious to the beginning of the
war the transportation rate on
flax from Argentina to the
United States ports ranged
from eight to 15 cents a bushel,
while the carrying rates and the
insurance charges at the present
time are from four to five
times this amount. A further
fact in the situation is the ac
tive demand for wheat with the
resulting high price of this crop
which is being planted in the
flax producing states.
"The above facts point to a
continuance of the present
good price for flax. Tn many
sections where the winter
wheat has killed out and es
pecially where spring wheat is
hard to get, flax may be plant»
ed with the reasonable assuance
of pretty good returns. From
14 to 20 pounds of seed per acre
is sufficient and in most sections
of the state the crop is pretty
sure of maturity even if the
spring planting is little delayedi
Early planting is advised, but
fair returns are frequently har*
vested even with late plantingi
"There are two points to
which those planting flax
ought to give special attention*
Be sure to get flax seed free
from weeds. Such weed seeds
as mustard, Russian thistle,
and a few other bad ones are
frequently present in flax seed
and the flax crop does not have
much power to hold down these
weeds. By all means growers
ought to get clean seed. The
second point is to treat the
seed for disease. Flax seed is
subject to certain diseases and
when these are present they
seriously reduce the yield."
