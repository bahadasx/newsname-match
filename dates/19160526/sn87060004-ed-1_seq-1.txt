EARLINGTON
NEEDS CITY BASE
BALL LEAGUE
Is Thought by the Basba
Fans of the City to Be a
Very Good Idea.
WHETHER OR NOT A LEAGUE
IS TO BE HAD REMAINS
ONLY YET TO BE SEEN
Is It possible that Earliugton
could have a city baae bal
league? Saveral baseball fans
have been discussing the proponi
tion and believe that it could be
had.
Earliugton needs something of
this sort to entertain Its people
tin the evenings after a loug hard
day's work tu drive away that
woary feeling and relieve tho
mind of the business transact
ions of tho day. Get away from
the counter and from behind the
dosk whore yon, have been con
fined all day and get an hour or
ao of enjoyment and exercise at
the athletic park watching or
participating in a snappy base-
ball game between Earlington
teams.
It could bo possible for Earl
ington to get enough men and
'ball fans who do play or are "old
timers" for fonr teams and thns
a league conld bo formed. At
loast-two games conld be played
each week in the evening.
.Many of the business men are
ball players and fans who wonld
onjoy taking a part and seeing
igameswho wonld not have the
opportunity to attend at any
.other time.
'Tho, business men and fans
should get together and talk it
over. A meeting conld be ar
ranged and the matter discussed
and probably Earlington can
have a baseball league and some
Tory interesting games this
summer.

JNO GAULEY DIES
IN EVANSVILLE
From Knife Wound Inflicted
in a Fight Several Weeks
Ago in Howell
THOSE THAT HAVE-GET BwesTON
BROUGHT HERE FOR INTERMENT
John Oauley, a 19 year-old bov
qfthis city, died in an Evansville
hospital Tuesday evening and was
brought home for burial yesterday.
The burial service took place this
morning at 10 o'clock in the Earling
ton cemetery. Some weeks ago Jno.
and Fred Cauley went to Howell.
Indiana, on a visit, and while there,
became involved in a fight with Wal
terBackes, a saloon keeper of that
place. Although the boys received
several wounds, they were not
thought to be serious at the time.
Twenty-nine days later Jno. Cauley
went to the St. Mary's hospital where
it developed that one knife wound
over his eye had penetrated the skull.
His mind became affected, spinal
meningitis developed and death re
sulted. Suit was filed several weeks
ago by John and Fred Oauley for
13,500 against J. W. McQuady, sa-
oonkeeper; and Henry Backes charg-
ing that the liquor the saloonkeepers
sold them was directly responsible
for the fight and its consequences.
The many friends of the family
extend sympathy to them in their
hour of bereavement.

Which Do You Prefer?
It is important for reasons of health and
practical economy for every housekeeper
to ask herself this question:
"Do I prefer a pure baking powder like
Royal, made of cream of tartar derived from
grapes, or am I willing to use a baking
powder made of alum or phosphate, both
(derived from mineral sources?"
The names of the ingredients printed
on the label show whether the land you
are now using or any brandy new or old
that may be offered is a genuine cream
of tartar powder, 'or merely a phosphate
or alum compound.
Royal Baking Powder contains no alum
nor phosphate.
