COLONEL AGREES
TO ENTER RACE
Oyster Bay, N. Y., May 23.-Theo
dore Roosevelt followed his hat into
the presidential ring when in un
equivocal language he accepted the
offer of the Roosevelt Republican com
mittee, represented in thirty states,
headed by former Secretary of the
Navy George von L. Meyer, to work
for his nomination by the Republican
national convention.
In accepting the offer voiced by Mr.
Meyer, Colonel Roosevelt paid his reo
slects to the candidacy of Justice
Hughes.
While he did not refer to the jus
tice by name there was no room for
doubt in the mind of his hearers as to
\1hom he had in mind.
With Mr. Meyer came more than a
score of Republicans who had joined
in the movement to organize Repub
lican efforts in his behalf. With him
also come a delegation of the "honie
folks," including the local station
agent, H. L. Marsh.
Colonel Roosevelt received them in
the north room at Sagamore Hill,
-\here amidst the trophies of the chase
and souvenirs from all parts of the
world they awaited him.
Meyer Pops the Question.
Secretary Meyer got down to busi
raess quickly, saying that the colonel
"better than any other man is listened
to and trusted by the great mass of
the people."
In reply Colonel Roosevelt said:
"I am naturally very deeply touched
and pleased by your action. I accept
it absolutely in the spirit in which
Ã½ ou havr> taken it. You are for mue

of great crisis in our country's lis
ticry. lecauise it is a great crisis in
the history of the world.
"If we are unprepared, if we are
split and sundered by rivalries of
creed, or section and national origin,
if our country's action is to be condi
tioned by helplessness without, and
the hyphenate within, the career of
the United States as a greater factor
in the world's civilization is at an end.
Half Measures Useless.
"There is no use of being for half
measures of Americanism and prepar
edness. Still less is it of any use
for any public man to announce him
self in vague general terms as in fa
vor of Americanism and preparedness,
unless his whole course of action in
public life has made it evident, and
now makes it evident that he means
just exactly what he says.
"Unless, if he is in office, or has
been in office, his career has been
such as in fullest measure to warrant
the belief that he is a man of deeds
and not of words in this matter, and
,unless in every crisis, whether he be
in or out of office, he frankly and fully
takes a position on the concrete facts
which are up for decision, and applies
the abstract statement directly to
these concrete facts.
"General professions are utterly
worthless unless, in the first place,
the man who makes them is ready im
mediately to apply them to every con
crete case as it actually arises.
"I am fighting for these principles.
They are the principles you are or
ganizing to support, and with all my
heart I welcome such support, accept
ing it as given primarily to the prin
ciples and only secondarily for myself.
"Any man at this time of crisis who
is not aggressively, openly and spe
cifically for these principles is against
Them, and every patriot should treat
our public servants on this basis."

MANY COUNTIES WILL
EXHIBIT AT STATE FAIR
Already twenty-five counties have
reserved space for their exhibits at the
Montana State fair and exposition this
year. This breaks all previous records
of reservations made thus early in the
season, and indicates that the number
of counties which will be represented
at the fair with exhibits this fall will
exceed that of any previous year.
The list of counties which already
have made appropriations to defray the
expense of a state fair exhibit, or the
commissioners of which have assured
Secretary R. S. Skinner of the pres
ence of exhibits, are Big Horn, Blaine,
Beaverhead, Broadwater, Custer,
Choteau, Cascade, Deer Lodge, Fergus,
Hill, Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, Mad
ison, Musselshell, Meagher. Missoula,
Park, Phillips, Rosebud, Ravalli, Sher
idan, Silver Bow, Sweet Grass, Valley
and Yellowstone.
In addition to this list, assurances
have been received from Prairie and
Richland counties that they will have
exhibits at the fair. Although Secre
tary Skinner has received no word from
Gallatin county, he is in hopes that it
will have an exhibit this year. It
dropped out last year for the first time
in many years.
Secretary Skinner is working with
the commercial clubs of the various
Montana towns wherever possible as
regards the matter of county exhibits
at the state fair, and with excellent re
sults. The Commercial club boosters
in every section of the state recognize
the advantages to be secured by having
an exhibit from their county at the
state fair, and the advertising benefits
derived from it.
Good Minstrel Show
(hristy' White Minstrels played
Wednesday and Thursday nights at the
Ronan o[era house to good houses.
Wednesday night's entertainment was
far above the average given in Ronan.
They carry a full orchestra and the
comedy and musical acts are unusually
good. An exceptionally good bill has
been reserved for tonight, the last of
the engagement. If you want to see
a good show, don't miss it.
32 TRACTS OF INDIAN
LANDS CHANGE HANDS
The last sale of Indian lands, held at
the agency near Dixon, on the 15th
inst., was the most successful of any
heretofore held. Thirty two tracts
were sold, all of which brought a slight
advance over the appraised value. In
almost every instance the tracts sold
were those where all cash was not ex
acted of the purchaser, deferred pay
ments being preferred by purchasers
to paying all cash down.
Of the tracts sold, five were in the
PoIson district, three in Ronan district,
Mission 10. Arlee six, Dixon four,
Camas four.
Another sale will undoubtedly be
held some time the last of the coming
year, at which time it is anticipated
many more tracts will be disposed of.
FARMERS' SHORT COURSE
ATTRACTS GOOD CROWDS
The Farmers' short course in agri
culture being held at the Round Butte
school house this week has been fairly
well attended. Profs. Burke and Hill
man of the state agricultural college at
Bozeman, and J. R. Campbell, county
agriculturist, have been there each day
and made short talks to the farmers on
dairying, soil conditions and kindred
subjects. Yesterday there were some
30 farmers present, not so many as
were expected, but each day has found
some new faces in the audience. Mrs.
Ed Coyle and daughter Mrs. Lyman
Turnquist, served lunch at noon and
everybody seemed to be taking the
keenest interest in the whole proceed
ings. Other talks will be made today
by the same people.

DISTRICI NO. 28
SCHOOLFESTIVAL,
Probably the largest crowd of people
ever attending a school festival in dis
trict No. 2h, assembled in RIonan last
I+ riday to take part in the exercises.
The weather looked threatening but
this did not deter many from coming to
town and by noon there were a great
many children and parents present.
This was the first year to have grad
uating exercises and Miss Alma Myers
has the distinction of being the first
graduate. She looked the part of the
beautiful girl graduate in her cap and
gown and is justly proud of achieve
ment in successfully passing the exams
for the four years devoted to high
school study.
The graduating exercises were held
in the opera house commencing at 10:30
and continued until the noon hour.
State Superintendent Davee was here
and made a short talk in the forenoon,
and also Prof. Holliday and Prof.
Daughters of the state university.
Dr. Resner, chairman of the local
board of trustees, made the present
ation address at the graduating exer
cises, when Miss Alma Myers received
her diploma.
The afternoon was devoted to finish
ing the field events left over from the
Leon meet, and Leon was an easy win
ner of the events, taking first and sec
ond in everything. This gave the ath
letic championship to Leon by a good
margin. McDonald of Leon won the
individual honors also.
Miss Kain's primary pupils attracted
great attention later in the afternoon
by their songs and folk dancing. The
little folks went through with their
part of the program to the delight of
teacher and all others present.
In the evening a banquet was served
at the high school rooms, where 110
sat down to the tables. Afterward a
number of three minute (stretched into
about 30) toasts were listened to with
attention. Those who responded were
Iver M. Brondjord, Miss Lucile Brown,
Superintendent Logan, County Super
intendent Mary Shull, State Superin
tendent Davee, D. N. Mason, Mrs. E.
F. Tabor, Senator Brower, Prof. Hol
liday and Prof. Daughter. Afterward
there was a dance in the opera house
where one of the largest crowds ever
attending such a function in Ronan took
part until near niorning.
All in all it was a very successfully
conducted festival. Each year the in
terest grows and from present indli
cations will soon be the big day of
every year on the reservation.
SWINDLERS REAP FORTUNE
"Fixed" Race Game Cost $10,000 In
East St. Louis.
East St. Louis, Ill., May 23.-A man
giving the name of John R. Harris
told the police that he had been
swindled out of $10,000 in a fake "fixed
horse race."
He said he turned his money over
to three men at a hotel here and that
in a few minutes they left the hotel
ostensibly to get some money from a
safe deposit vault.
head, gathering tonnage statis
tics of the past few years and
facts upon which future business
for a transportation line can be
based. After completing his in
vestigation a report will be made
to the executive committee of the
proposed electric road and upon
this report the promoters hope
to interest capital in the enter
prise.
Years of experience in rail
roading with one of the main
trans-continental lines especially
fit Mr. Weeks for this important
work and his report can be re
lied upon as accurate and indi
cating whether there is suf
ficient business in this valley to
justify the investment of the
money necessary to construct
and equip the line.
SOMERS BATS HARD
WINS SUNDAY AME
T'I 1 enan fans were out in force
oeet Sunday and were doomed to wit
nei their team go down to defeat for
the iust time this season. Smarting
hrom the drubbing given them two
weeks ago, the Somers players were on
their mettle and commenced making
runs in the first inning and were never
headed.
The cold, disagreeable wind must
have had more of an error breeding
effect on the local team than on their
adversaries, as they commenced boot
ing and muffing right from the start
and the score keeper wore out his pen
cil point recording same and then failed
to use his pen knife so we are unable
to give the exact figures, but they were
plenty.
Joe White, our colored heaver, was
not at his best in the frigid atmosphere
and his curves were solved by the
Somers sluggers (and they are some
sluggers) in nearly every inning he
occupied the mound, His arm failed
to respond in the cold and he retired
after six innings and Ben Hull went in
the box for Ronan. Ben's slants were
not so easy and he held the score down
from point to the finish. The home in
field and some of the outfielders could
not properly gauge the base hits made
off Joe and it looked like the defeat
which appeared certain would be a
rout, but after a few innings they set
tled down and held the score to reason
able closeness, the contest ending Ro
nan 3, Somers 7.
Part of this humiliation can be
chalked up to luck. Every time a Ro
nan batter connected with the ball it
would land right in a Somers player's
hands and the result was an easy out.
On the contrary a short hit by Somers
went where there was no one and he
was safe at first. Such is the luck of
base ball. But don't misunderstand us.
Those Somers fellows play real hall
and will be found dangerous at any
stage of the proceedings. It will re
quire real ball players to beat them.
Their .battery is strong, their infield
well balanced and the outfield gets
everything in the air. They are ball
players. Defeat from their hands
loses half the sting. This makes one
game each, and now for the rubber.
The gate receipts last Sunday were
$71.00, showing that Ronan fans will
turn out and support a team.
Next Sunday there will be another
game on the home daimond, the Mission
Reds being scheduled for that date.
This will be another game worth com
ing miles to see.
COURT STATUTE ANNULLED

RONAN TEACHERS CAMPING
AND MOUNTAIN CLIMBING
The seven Ronan school teachers are
on a camping and mountain climbing
trip to Lake McDonald and the peaks
in that vicinity this week, They left
Sunday afternoon last equipped for a
stay lasting all week and those in the
party were Dr. Becker, Peter E. Han
son, Misses Barbara Kain, Azelie Sav
age, Anna Rafferty, Hilda Marsh and
Irene Teagarden.
Duncan McDonald of Ravalli was to
meet them at Post creek to act as
guide on their mountain climbing trips
and this shows acute knowledge on the
part of the teachers in securing so com
petent a man to accompany them. The
weather was not very encouraging for
a trip last Sunday when they left Ro
nan and the cool weather the fore part
of the week was not the kind that
camping parties would most enjoy, but
nothing daunted they started out in
good spirits.
INTERESTING LETTER FROM
FORMER FLATHEAD RESIDENT
Coronado. California.
Ronan Pioneer:
Since my arrival at this place I have
had in mind my promise to inform my
Ronan friends of conditions as I found
them in southern California, but have
delayed until 1 could give definite infor
mation gained by personal experience.
Climate conditions are ideally per
fect, December and January were
unusually rainy according to the old
settlers and resulted in considerable
dIn age from floods in the valleys,
though at this place we were not
inconvenienced.
There were many sunny days during
this time, and at no time was the tem
perature low enough to be uncomfort
able. It was about like spring weather
in Montana. As a country to live in it
is the most perfect I ever saw. The
only disadvantage is that business in
some lines is overdone, yet the majority
seem prosperous, unskilled labor is over
supplied.
I am glad to say we have no com
plaint to make regarding the business
outlook.
There are so many interesting places
to visit on the sea shore and in the
mountains and valleys that one has no
time to become lonesome.
The cost of these excursions are very
reasonable. The roadways are ideal
and smooth as city asphalt street and
with no dust.
We made a trip to La Jolla (pron
ouced La Hoyya) eighteen miles by
motor car for 50 cents the round trip.
It is a grand scenic trip along the ocean
front. For a vacation trip there is no
place I know of that is as interesting
as southern California, with its flowers,
fruits and tropical foliage, it seems like
a new world.
Groceries are about the same price
as at Ronan, but fruit and vegetables
are very cheap and good and supplied
all the year around.
At North Island adjoining this city is
located the U. S. Aviation Station and
school. It is connected with Coronado
by a narrow beach, hence is not an
island though so designated. One may
see olmost anytime from one to a half
a dozen flyers in the sky. They are so
common no one but tourists ever stop
to view them
In the harbor may be seen from one
to a dozen U. S. war vessels.
The Mexican bordor is about twelve
miles south and at Tia Juana (pro
nounced Ke Wanna) is located "the
sporting man's paradise," bull fights,
horse racing and gambling of every
description. I regret to say it seems
to be well patronized.
I am sending some postal cards for
the walls of the Pioneer office and any
one interested can see them there.
As we are delighted with this country
it is not likely we will ever return to
Montana except for a visit.
Wishing you all prosperity and happi
ness, I am,
L. G. BIGELOW.

BRAGOON JURY IS
UNABLE TO AGREE
Alinneuapolis, May 23.-Deadlocked.
11 to 1, the Joseph W. Bragdon jury
reported a disagreement after delib
erating forty-seven hours.
A few minutes after Judge Daniel

fldavit filed last week by Mrs. Mabel
Peterson as having been approached
by Mrs. Anna Davis and reported by
Mrs. Davis as "a Bragdon man."
Members of the jury asserted, after
they were dismissed, that in fifteen
ballots Bastyr stood alone for acquit
tal. They charged further that Bas
tyr threatened them with prosecution
if they made known the lineup of the
jury and that he declared that he
never would change his vote.
When Bastyr was asked regarding
the cause for the disagreement he dis
missed the subject of replying:
"None of your damned business."
Judge Fish set the third trial of
Bragdon on a charge of a criminal at
tack on a young girl for June 5 and
ordered the ball of $35,000 to stand.
