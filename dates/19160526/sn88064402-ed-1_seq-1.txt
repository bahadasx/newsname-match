late.

Vermont, July 13, 1861,. where she lived
until after her marriage to Mr. F. H.
Moore, May 11, 1869. Prom Vermont

they have since resided.

vived by four ,sons, Messrs, Mark H.
Moore of Guthrie Center, IL; Frank R.

C. V. Moore of Welsh; and four daugh
ters, Ie. Pearl Hyde of DesMoineas,

WELSH HIGH SCHOOL
IS HIGHLY COMMENDED
In the March report of C. A. Ives,
State High School Inspector, to State
Superintendent T. H. Harris, we find
some very interesting references to
the Welsh High School. In making
his report Mr. Ives says of the Welsh
School:
We found this school well organized
and doing good work. One gets the
impression that the teachers are en
thusiastic in their work, that children
are orderly, respectful toward their
teachers and industrious in their stu
dies. While pleased with what we
saw in several classes both in ele
mentary and high school grades, we
desire to mention especially the pro
ficiency of the tenth grdde French
class, which has the third year
French (this school gives four years
in French). The ease with which
they turned French into English and
English into French showed alike
good teaching and good preparation.
"The class in plain geeot.etry is in
the first book and has done 90 per
cent. of the exercises thus far.
"The teacher of the second grade
teaches sight singing in the grades,
with good results.
"A separate building was erected
last summer for the use of domestic
economy and manual training. This
building in two stories, with two
rooms and gallery on the first floor
and two rooms on the second. Both
these departments are well equipped,
handled by competent teachers, and
have the enthusiastic interest of .stu
dents. We would commend the jani
tor service of this school, as the build
ing is kept in a very cleanly manner.
The principal has put up 'out-door ap
paratus for physical exercise, teet
ing boards, sli'des, traveling rings,
etc. It is a pleasant sight to see
children in enjoying their play time so
intensely and building up a strong
physique with which to combat and
ward off ailments. We wish more of
our schools would set up such appa
ratus. It does not cost so mftch, but
even if it should, money spent to give
facilities whereby our school children
may have these wholesome pleasures
,render discipline by the teacher less
necessary and acquire the boon of
strength and health, should not be
grudged by school communities."
