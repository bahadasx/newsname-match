LON DON, May . . 26.f-rNothlng like
the bombardment that raged over
. the Verdun., front yesterday has
ever been known, according to the of
ficial account! ,ef tba fighting on that
Wood soaked field. The official writers
have abandoned their well used atljee
tives and ihnde use-of one only "un
precedented. " ,
Unprecedented bombard ments along
the whole of the battered line, is the
way the German and French commu

One or the acenfi of moat desperate
struggling was the quarry near Han
dremont. Here, wlmre the fighting for
months has been terrific, the German
dead was piled high, as charge after
charge broke down under the fire of the
French seventy-five ceitimeter and ma
china guns.
Time after time tha Teutons, acting
under orders from the supreme com
mand to take the quarry at no mater
what Mist, sprang forward' to the at-
turk, only to be driven back..
Of the fighting near; Douaumont, the
French sny, tha Germans took a sec
tion of one trench, after spending lav
iHhly of their lives to win it, but every
where eln their attacks were repulsed
with tremendously heavy losses.
Another Drive Expected
Over on tba pppoaita of the Meuse
the Germans are apparently preparing
for another assault on Hill 304, which
flanks the f amoua - Le Mort Homme,
yesterday the Teuton atfT begun anbw
the bombardment of this position, evi
dently with the intention of paving the
way for infantry attacks, which the
French command expects will be made
toflay or tomorrow
Slaughter Is Frightful
Returning' French soldiers and Ger
man prisoners taken in this fight say
it was the bloodiest of all that have
made the quarry historic. The French
had machine guna in place and as the
Germans came An, they waited until the
foes passed out of . tha tone of the
artillery fire and then began sweeping
them with the spurting jets of bullets
from the smaller deadlier guns.
But tli German commanders were
determined tn take .the ground, and
despite vll thnt, the' French could do
massed troops at the, point and bat
tered the - defenders with the heavy
- cannon, Until thtf French line gave and
the advance trenches ' defending the
position fell inte the hands of tha Ger
man infnntry.
French Beat Oennxai Back
'Kost of Ouniieri'a, tdo, there was des
pcrato flfrh'iug, say the official state
ments of both sides. Paris declares
that much o,,it,wss done with the
hantf greii'tile and that the French, in
spite of heroin resistance on the part
of the Germans, beat, the Teutons buck
fer minor Ruins.
West nd south of Douaumont, sny
the (lennxn despatches, the Teutonic
forces continued . pressing the Gauls
backward toward Vordun.
"Here Kignal success was gained,"
