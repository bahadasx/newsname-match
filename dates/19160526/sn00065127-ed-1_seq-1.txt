TAMING THE UNTAMED GIANT
OF THE AGES
Electricity Defied by Ajax Now Har
nessed to Operate Milwaukee
Trains Over the Rockies.
The myth of Ajax 's defiance of Jove's
lightning was the expression for three
thousand years of the world's opinion
of electricity.
Then suddenly, in a few decades,
the terror of the ages was seen to be
the most beneficent and most power
ful servant of man.
Its transcendent value to the race
Is nowhere better exemplified than in
the electrification of the "Milwaukee
Road" for 440 miles from Ilarlowton,
Montana, to Avery, Idaho. From the
plunging mountain waterfalls, it is
taken and sent along the wires to the
mighty electric locomotives that haul
the all-steel trains of 'The Olympian"
and "The Columbian" and the long
heavily loaded freight trains over the
mile-high ramparts of the Great Con
tinental Divide. Whether to carry ton
nage or to yield the traveler the com
forts of smooth, clean travel, its enor
mous power, in winter and in sum
mer, Is wholly at man's service.
To the supreme travel qualities of
the "Milwaukee"—a splendid road
bed—luxurious equipment—magniti
cent scenery—accessibility to several
of the National Parks and the re
nowned personal service of the em
ployees—is 'now added the delights of
electric travel through the very heart
of the mountains.
Take the 'Milwaukee" on your next
trip to the Pacific North Coast.

A County Advisor.
lion. 11. II. Cable makes a good
suggestion when he writes the follow
ing to the Uudsonlte. Other counties
in the state have tried this and found
that It pays big returns on the Invest
ment.
There are two things which 1 be
lieve would be a great bentlt in the
development of the State, especially
here iu the more thickly settled part.
One a County Advisor, a capable man
who could be called on for advice
along technical or seient.llic lines in
agriculture, horticulture or in the
handling of stock. Of course a great
deal of this advice might be theoretic
al but the average farmer would be
able, by practical application, to get
real help in a great many of his prob
lems, The County Advisor Is no long
er an experiment but Is being used
with splendid success in a great many
of the best counties in some of the
surrounding states. A demonstration
farm in each county would be a
splendid thing and as Lincoln County
already has a farm and is one of the
best counties in the state, why should
we not establish such a .farm under
the supervision of An expert who
would be the County Advisor-'
Good roads Is one of the most im
portant questions for us to settle and
should be worked out at once. Ow
ing to poor roads a portion of the
year moving products from the farm
to the primary market is one of the
great items of expense of production.
Tills can be remedied to quite an ex
tent by proper road building without
greatly added expense. In order to
geii the best results there should be
dettnlte plans for the roads and per
manent bridges and culverts made by
one who knows the business. If a
county engineer should be employed,
care should be taken that the process
of planning and executing the plans
should not become too complicated
and too much of the road funds be
used in red tape and cumbersome
methods as la the case In some states.
The minor repairs and the carrying
out of the details of the plans should
bu left tj the local authorities and
the process of road building be made
a help and not a hindrance to the
local communities.
Possibly the two suggestions could
be carried out as one and one man
employed for the work. If so It would
take a big man at a good salary, but
would it not be worth while?
Now let us boost for our community
and county, and in working out our
local problems we will add to the
general boost for The Best State in
the Land.
Mr. and Mrs. Obel Ulrlckson came
down from Canton on Monday after

he had to pick out a rainy day to do
his visiting in.—Uudsonlte.

FISHING PARTY MAKES RECORD
Seven Men Make Total Catch Of
166 Finny Prizes.
The following taken from the Long
Beach, Cal., Daily Telegram of May
12th shows how some of our old Can
tonites are enjoying life on the coast:
While there are some pretty good
fisherman maintaining their habitat
In Long Beach, It remained for a
mixed party of local and tourist men
to break all records hung up this
season to date. The party, consisting
of seven members, landed at the Pine
avenue.pier Thursday afternoon with
ltiC lish, of which 145 were barracuda.
The catch of barracuda is hailed as
being the record catch for any pre
vious rod and reel party for the past
two seasons, the total catch of the
party being more than 500 pounds in
weight.
The success of the anglers can be
laid to two factors, thetirst being that
they were under the tutelage of Capt.
"Billy" Graves, than whom there is
no wiser fisherman on the south coast,
and secondly, all were sportsmen.
Making the trip aboard Capt.
Graves' trim little launch, the Tour
ist, the party members were J. G.

Cemetery are requested to pay their
yearly assessment to the Sexton by
order of the Board of Directors.
These assessments must be paid if
you want your lot kept up. The lot
owners can send their assessment by
mall and there will be a receipt sent
back to them for the same, and It is
further stated that no one is allowed
to do any work of any kind on their
lots In the cemetery without the per
mission of the Sexton. Remember
this payment should be made direct
to me and not to any other person.

June 3 Is Horse Day.
All farmers who are Interested In
fetter horses will, lielp celebrate
"better stallion day," which will be
held in practically every county in
the state on Jane 3. This is urged by
Guy E. Morrison, livestock specialist
of the state college extension depart
ment. He says: "If you own a pure
bred stallion, show him. If you do
not own one, go to the show and see
what is being produced in your county.
We can grow better horses it we
demand better stallions."
School Officers Attention.
School officers should remember
that there is a law requiring the pub
lication of receipts and expenditures
of the school district. There Is no
necessity of publishing a lonit report
such as is made to the Superintendent.
The main purpose seems to be that It
be made known in what bank the
money was kept. The following form

Once more the cycle of the seasons
brings to us our beautiful memorial
mouth of May and her flowering fields
serve to again remind us of the debt
and duty we owe to those brave men
whose lives were given in defense of
Our Country.
Long since have American citizens
grown familiar with the object and
purpose of Memorial Day, and each
year its advent is looked forward to
with Increased affection and gratitude.
A grateful people make a gracious
land, and rightly are we proud of
those who by their measureless sacri
fice made possible the position this
country now holds in the columnar
rank of nations and justly we do
homage to the heroic dead. By the
history of these hallowed lives, we
who live today and they who follow
us tomorrow are and will forever be
Inspired to a loftier citizenship and
an enhanced devotion to the prin
ciples of justice, the solidarity of the
United States, and the honor and
glory of the American nation.
Therefore, I, Frank M. Byrne,
Governor of the State of Scuth Da
kota, do hereby Issue this my procla
mation and earnestly urge the ob
servance of May 30, 1916, as
MEMORIAL DAY,
especially requesting that the day be
free from all games and sports and
given over entirely to the expression
of patriotism and love of country.
In Witness Whereof I have here

Treatment, For Sore Shoulders On
Horses
The feet of no two persons are alike,
consequently they cannot wear the
same shoes comfortably unless they
are first adjusted by several days of
preliminary wear. During this period
of adjustment the wearer's feet be
come tire4, and blisters, callouses and
corns may appear. Horses' shoulders
are like men's feet In this respect. A
horse wears a collar today that fits
him, tomorrow one that Is too small,
and the next day one that is his size,
but does not conform to his shoulders.
The result of such management is
sore shoulders and necks that refuse
to heal even with the diligent applica
tion of a never failing cure. It follows
therefore, that the first requisite for
the prevention of sore shoulders is a
perfect fitting collar.
There are numerous remedies for
sore shoulders that give satisfactory
results, providing all other conditions
are favorable. The application of
white lead ground in linseed oil, the
kind used for mixing paint, every
evening after the collar is removed,
has proven satisfactory. A lotion
composed of six drams of lead acetate
and the same quantity of zinc sulphate
in one pint of water makes a satis
factory wash for sore necks. Apply it
three times a day. Oxide of zinc oint
ment is also very good applied several
times daily.
When any medical treatment Is ap
plied, it must be remembered that
good results Iyow only when the col
lars lit perfectly and are kept scrupu
lously clean on the bearing surface by
daily washing if necessary.—Dr. C. C.
Lipp, South Dakota State College.
Postmaster Jones informed us the
other day that larger postal savings
deposits would be accepted at the
post office. This is made possible by
an amendment to the postal savings
act just approved by President Wil
son which allows a depositor to have
an account of $1.000 upon which In
terest will be paid. Formerly $500
was the limit and not more than $100
could be deposited in a month but
this limit is also abolished. While
the system has proved a signal success
still it haa fallen short of the demands
of the public on account of the re
strictions which have now been elimi
nated.
