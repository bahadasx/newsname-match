( a Feature
Hundreds of farmers were attract
ed to Pullman last Saturday by the
second annual show and mock sale
of the Saddle and Sirloin club of the
State College, when 52 head of the
college live stock were sold under
the hammer by 11. C. Crank- of Spo
kane to the students of the animal
husbandry division. The fictitious
sales amounted to a total of $15,435,
or within a few hundred dollars of
the true value of the animals offered,
which proved the great value of the
annual sales from the standpoint of
the students themselves.
Several farmers were disappoint
ed in not being able to witness the
big parade, which was held at 1:30 |
after having been advertised for 2:00 I
o'clock by the Chamber of Com- i
merce, but the hundreds who lined
the streets when the long parade of
blue-blooded stock passed had their
eyes opened to the fact that the
State College owns some of the best
live stock to he had. The thorough
bred stallions owned by Nat Bryant
and ('has. Stirewalt were included in
the parade and proved that the farm
ers of Pullman are awake to the
fact that the best of horseflesh is a
requisite to successful farming.
Tommy Kayler, with his infant
sheep, which drank copiously from a
nursing bottle, was a feature of the
parade. "Fat" Herretd, of W. S. C.
football fame, came to Hie conclu
sion that line bucking is a simple'
matter compared to driving a goose
when the college gander refused to '
listen to his pleadings and threats 1
and balked stubbornly.
The condition of the animals as
well as the accurate knowledge of
their value shown by the students
was proof of the care given the stock
for the last month. Clarence B.
Horral, assigned Colony Winsome,
the Clydesdale mare who brought
the record amount of $1650, re
ceived the silver cup for the best
groomed animal. John Poison, with j
Willomore Ila, an Ayrshire heifer,
under his care, won a pure bred pig
as second prize. George A. Tobin, :
who was in charge of Sweetwater
Pride, a Hereford steer, took third
Prize, a silver cup.
The prize winners for the beat
groomed animals were announced at
the banquet given by the club Sat
urday night at the Palace hotel.
Seventy-eight live stock enthusiasts
were present. Prof. George Sever
ance, head of the agricultural de
partment, presided as toastniaster.
Addresses were given by President
B. 0. Holland, Dr. E. A. Bryan, Dr.
■'a D. Cardiff, Prof. William Hys

The plan of the chamber is outlined

i in its entirely, is as follows:
"Al the last meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce the possibility of
helping college students to secure
work in the harvest fields was dis
cussed. Representatives of the col
lege stated that there were many
students who would like this work
if they knew when and where to p^t
j It. Several ranchers who employ a
considerable number of men each
year stated their preference for stu
dent help over thai of Itinerant lab-,
I orers.
"A committee of three men was
1 appointed to investigate the p.ituatLtr.
and see whether or not some scheme
for connecting students and >v 'oy
i-is of harvest hands would he prac-1
i ticnl.
•'Will you not let me have your
; views upon the subject, and especial- •
I ly regarding the following points-:
•Would the ranchers in your local

work in the harvest fields?
"Approximately when will your

"About what wages will be paid! j
"Is there some man In your com-1
munity with whom students wanting]
, work could communicate?
"Will you please make any sug
gestion I you have regarding this
matter?
"We had thought of the possibil
ity of preparing a printed statement
telling when the harvest would be-

| of men likely to be needed, wages to
| be paid, and some man or men in
each section with whom prospective
(harvest hands could communicate."
