The CUan Up Campaign
The clean up campaign, which
has been urged by the News for
some time, has brought forth
fruit and today Clovis is without
question one of the cleanest
towns in the state. Tuesday, a
plan was inaugurated by the
city authorities which has re
sulted in removing practically
all the rubbish and unsightly
filth from our streets and alleys.
Four squads of boys were en
gaged to assist in the movement
and with four wagons and a man
superintendent on each, they
were assigned to districts cover
ing the city. The clean streets
and alleys bear mute evidence
that the biys did their work
well. While Clovis is far from
being a "spotless" town, it is
by no means a filthy place. This
great clean up wo. k was done
without any considerable cost
and the results well repay for
the effort. Credit is due Mayor
Childers, City Marshal Irvine
and others who have given this
matter their personal attention
An Explanation
I wish to state to the public
that 1 am not electioneering for
any candidate for any office in
the coming election. Whatever
statements may be published as
coming from me are simply rec
ommendations of men whom I
know to be good men and be
lieve to be capable of filling well
the offices to which they aspire.
I trust that these statements
will be considered as standing
alone and without any regard to
the heading above them or the
setting they may have in the
papers.

His lead in the primaries in

they will also give him a sub-

LYMAN E. SHAW
Candidate for Representative in the Legislature.
Mr. Shaw authorizes the News
to state that he is making the
race for office solely upon his
own merits and in no manner
does he intend to attack the
moral standing or good name of
his opponents in this campaign.
The following letter from Rev.
u. w. Lambert will testify to
his "good standing" in this
community:
TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN:
This is to testify that I have
been personally acquainted with
Mr. L. E. Shaw, a candidate
for representative from Curry
County, for more than two
years. Mr. Shaw is a man of
excellent ability and fitness for
such an office. As to his moral
standing and uprightness of
character he is the peer of any
man in the county. He is a
member of the Christian Church
of this city in full fellowship
and good standing. If he is
elected, I believe he will worthi
ly represent the county and that
he will be on the right side of
every issue confronting him.
Respectfully,
C, W. Lambert,
Pastor First Christian Church,

Perpetual Office Seekers
In speaking of perpetual can
didates for office in Quay County,
the Tucumcari Sun, a staunch
democratic paper, says:
THE PERPETUAL TERM MEN
NOT WANTED
The editor of this paper has
talked to a great many people
from every part of Qjay county
in regard to the coming election,
and finds that there are certain
tilings that the people are almost
universally in favor of. Above
all the people will not stand for
the perpetual term man, the one
that thinks he has a copyright
on the job. In cases where a
man has made good it is only
juat that he should be elected
for a second term, where a
single term is not over two
years; but it takes a piece of gall
for a man to ask the people to i
re elect him where he has al
ready been in lor six ytars.
This "efficiency" stuff is not go
ing to work with the people,
when said "efficiency" is all
claimed by the officers, asking
re-election. Some very fine
records have been made bv of
ficers, in the county, but it must
be remembered that these rec
ords were due largely to the
good citizens themselves.
Anniversary of the New
Mexico Mutual Life and
Aid Association
Yeomen Attention
All Yeomen are urged to be
present at Lodge Monday night
May 29, 1916. Business of im
portance to come before the
lodge. R. B. Stanton,
Hon. Foreman
The New Mexico Mutual Life
and Aid Association is rounding
out its first year in our midst
And to say this institution has
made good from every conceiv
aole standpoint, is putting it
mildly.
The Association was organized
bv home people primarily for
the protection of home people.
It is fulfilling, magnificently, its
mission. At it head are some
of the best and most successful
men or tins section, which is a
sufficient guarantee of the per
manency, rairness ana success
of the A?sociation.
It is the purpose of this As
sociation to furnish protection at
actual cost to all our citizens who
are physically eligible. Only
two deaths have occured during
the past year among the mem
bers, which shows that special
care is exercised in the selection
of its members. These claims
were paid within a few hours
after death came. This the As
sociation proposes to do with all
its claims!
It is doubtful if any organi- j
zation among us will mean more
to our people in the years to
come than The New Mexico
Mutual Life and Aid Association.
New members are being con
stantly added and ere long this
will be one of the really great
institutions of this section.

Tucumcari Wins Game
About twenty people, mostly
members of the Elks lodge, went
to Tucumcari Saturday in autos
to witness the game between
the teams of the Clovis and Tu
cumcari "Bills." They returned
home Sunday a tired but satisfied
bunch -satisfied that they will
not go again S' on. They report
a good time and very hospitable
treatment, but the trip was tire
some. Saturday night they
were entertained at a ball given
in their honor and Sunday after
noon the game was played be
tween members of the order,
which resulted in a score of 5 to
4 in favor of Tucumcari. No
accidents occurred to mar the
pleasure of the trip, but some of
the visitors paid rather dearly
for their experience. G. A.
Finest Strawberries
We can vouch for the state
ment that the strawberries
raised on the Buchanan farm
near Portales are the best o
the market, because we were
presented with a couple of boxes
just from the patch and can
therefore testify as to the afore
said statement of facts. Mr.
Buchanan, who was in town
Saturday, said that he picks
them the same day they are
sent to the Morris Grocery and
other merchants to market for
him.
Two Fires
A residence on west Grand
Avenue burned to the ground
Sunday morning at 2:30. It was
occupied by Lee Marsh who
owned the furniture. The fire
Campbell lost a. $125.00 diamond.' 8 supposed to have originated
Will Curren lost a suit case and
suit from the car at some point
between Clovis and Grady en
route over and "Skeet" Kerr
lost a blue serge coat. Some of
the boys lost their hearts to the
Tucumcari fair ones and Hobart
Millet lost his appetite.
Clovis-Texico Ball Game
The Clovis -horribles" and
the Texico "terribles" crossed
bats at the local diamond on the
north park addition Sunday. It
was a "try-out" game to secure
players for a regular team for
the season. The Clovis team
won by a score of 15 to 3.
from an overheated stove as Mr.
Marsh made a fire about mid
night. He was later awakened
by his dog to find the house in
flames. The furniture was in
sured. A shed belonging to Dr.
Dillon was burned Tuesday. It
caught from a bon fire.
Local happenings of interest
are being crowded out of the
piper these weeks because of
the demand for spase by the
candidates. Fully two columns
of local news and a dozen ads
were crowded out last week.
In addition we were compelled
to 'ditch" some country corre
spondence.

HON. W. W. NICHOLS
Chairman of the Curry County Democratic Central Committee.
W. W. Nichols, former repre
sentative in the state legislature
from Curry County, was elected
Chairman of the County Demo
cratic Central Committee at the
convention held last week. The
Democrats of the county exhibit
ed excellent judgment in making
this selection as it will go far
toward harmonizing the more or
less recalcitrant factions which
heretofore have existed. Mr.
Nichols has never participated
actively with any particular
faction but has always been a
harmony worker in the ranks of
the party. Contrary to the at
titude of his colleague in the
upper house, when in the legis
lature, he made friends with
members of the opposition party
who were in the majority and
at the same time upheld the
principles of the party he was
there to represent. By skillful
diplomocy he was able to effect
combinations that gave his
measures support and at the
same time he retained the re
spect and friendship of members
of both parties.
The News was so well pleased
with his work in the legislature
that upon his return, we sug
gested that he be elected to the
upper house at the next general
election.
