the South Carolina na;\al militia was
announced in a letter received yesterday
by the adjutant general's office
from the navy department. There
are 200 men and officers in the four
divisions of the naval militia.
iThe four divisions have been ordered
to leave Charleston July 15 by rail
for the navy yard at Philadelphia. On
July 17 the divisions will embark on
the battleship Illinois and proceed to

"The Sowers.*
There is a timeliness in the presentation
on the screen of a story
ia-p "The lowers.' It is' a filmed ver
sion of Henry Seton Merriman's wide-1
ly read novel and the story tells of
movements in Russia to free the serfs
from political ad industrial suppression.
Blanche Sweet, one of the most noted
stars of the screen, appears in the
leading- role of "The Sowers' and will
be seen in a part teeming with human
sympathy.
The Dhotonlav was produced under ,
the direction of .William C. DeMille j
who has been so successful in the di- j
rection of Miss Sweet's recent production
":The Ragamuffin" and the
sensational "Dlack-List."

Washington, May 24.?iihe senate
judiciary committee today recommended
confirmation of the nomination
of Louis D. Branaeis to the supreme
court by a strict party vote, all
the Democrats voti.vg for confirmation
and all the Republicans against
it.

ask for action on the recommenda- j
tion by the senate tomorrow at an \
executive session, while the opposing j
senators are planning to force, if possible,
open sessions for the conideration
of the nomination. Prolonged debate
may result, but Mr. Brandeis'
friends claim' he will be confirmed before
the recesses for the national conventions
begin on June 3. .
After weeks spe^t in taking testimony
through a subcommittee and in
discussing the subcommittee's report,
action came today without debate in
a seven minute session. There was
nothing said beyond calling the roll.
Doubt as to the outcome existed until
the name of Senator Shields was
reached. -His vote in favor of Mr.
Brandeis was the deciding factor, the
committee standing 10 to 8 for a fav!
orable report.
Just before going to the committee
meeting Senator Shields conferred
with Senator Smith of Georgia, who
had rhade an investigation outside the
j record during the absence of Senator
Shields, who returned today from
Knoxville. The Georgia senator had
interviews with members of the interstate
commerce commission and several
Boston lawyers in regard to the
charges against Mr. Brandeis and
after satisfying himself that the
j charges were not sustained, had a
talk a few days ago with Mr. Brandeis
himself.
Friends of the nominee plan to oppose
open session? on the ground
that this is a movement for delay in
confirmation and if open sessions are
to be had they should be on other
cases.
ASKS MORE MILITIA

Kiniston fsIU on Department to Let

San Antonio, Tex., -May 22.?Gen.
Funston's request for more coast artillery,
it is understood here, has been
refused by the war department. Gen.
Funston refused to confirm the report,
but it was indicated at his headquarters
that he had replied to the
dat\!irtmont'c rpfusal hv a rpouest that
more militia be sent to him to
r^ortgthen the border patrol.
The militia in camp here will start
moving towards the border tomorrow.
Reports from Gen. Pershing today
indicated no sharp developments.
Late tonight it was said at headquarters
that Gen. Funston originally
asked the war department for the
National Guard of Arizona, New Mex-!
ico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and j
Oklahoma. j
Later the request was renewed and
the militia of the three 'border States
was ordered. It is understood the request
still stands for the other troops.
It is considered possible they will be
mobilized, at least a portion of them
to serve on the border in lieu of coast
artillery which could not be sent. j

The State.
#
Alva M. Lumpkin of Columbia will
be at the head of the order of Knights
of Pythias i:i South Carolina for the
ensuing year. He was chosen grand
chancellor at the pession of the grand
lodge yesterday. Mr. Lumpkin has
been grand vice chancellor for the
past year and had previously served
a year as grand prelate, he is one
of the most earnest knights in the
-State, and his fellow Pythians delight
to honor him. The grand lodge adjourned
yesterday to meet next year
at Union.
Other officers eiecceu were: W. E.
nf Aranp'Ahiire' grand vlcO
u ci A lcrv. v/i. v* o-' ? chancellor;

E. "R. Cox of Darlington,
grand master at arms; >W. E. Fewell
of Rock Hill, grand incer guard; M.
H. Ohlandt of Beaufort, grand outer

appointed J. Earle Boozer of Colum
bia to serve for a term of three years

ferred the day before made their recommendations,
and debate "was at
times lively. The recommendation of
the retiring grand chancellor, Her- hprt
E Gvles. relative to abolishing
deputy grand chancellors evoked an
animated but fraternal debate. The
recommendation of the judiciary that
all committees be appointed from
members-elect to the grand lodge, ar.d
not otherwise as is now in vogue,
likewise, produced a spirited debate.
Both recommendations ultimately
were adopted. (The proposal to eliminate
the payment of a per diem and
m teage to all past grand chancellors
was adopted without remark. A propoped
c'-snge in the constitution so as
to provide for biennial sessions ui
the grand lodge and two-year terms
for gra; d lodge officers was vigorously
debated, and then killed by a large
vote. A similar proposal to provide
for semi-annual elections for officers
of subordinate lodges was likewise
defeated. * * ;
Thornwell Fund. '* ;
Upon morion of '.AI/.a M. Lumpkin
a committee of five was appointed to
consider th,-> advisability of enlarging
the TnornweU memorial fund, and
recommend upo.i its permanent investment
where it will best serve the
purpose for which it was contributed.
This fund is a memorial to the
late .James H. Thornwell. who for
many years was grand keeper of records
and seal It now amounts to
about $5,000, the interest on which is
equally divided between four denominational
orphanages in the State.
