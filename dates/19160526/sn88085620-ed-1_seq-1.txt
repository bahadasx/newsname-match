VOL. XXV.
Richest are the
Biggest Thieves
THE GREAT TAX THIEVES AUK,
THE AMERICAN MULTI-MILLION-I '.
AIRES.
The evidence tends to shew that
in one case alone—the estate of
L. V. Harkness—the published
facts indicate evasions involving
in taxes and penalties more than
ONE MILLION DOLLARS.
The evidence to show the Rocke
feller Foundation is a device by
which John D. Rockefeller has
escaped taxation upon more than
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS of his
annual income.
The great frauds in connection
with the theatrical industry and
foreign steamship companies, in
volving millions of dollars in taxes
and thousands of individuals, have
been uncovered.
The evidence reveals the inef
festiveness of the existing income
tax law and shows the great loop
holes left by "jokers" in the act,
through which hundreds of mil
lions of dollars have so far suc
ceeded in avoiding taxation.
The utter inadequacy, both in
numbers and ability, of the Treas
ury Department's collection force
is clearly revealed. Not only is
there only one income tax agent
for each 500,000 of the population,
but $1,800-clerks are pitted against
the shrewdest lawyers and most
skillful accountants in the nation.
The Treasury Department's exam
ining system is also defective in
that it detects only the tax losses
arising from clumsiness and ignor
ance and is powerless to prevent
or expose cunning and deliberate
fraud.
Put at the base of all the frauds
lies the provision of the law
which guarantees complete SE
CRECY regarding all income tax
transactions. Under this cloak of
secrecy is concealed not only the
identity of the thieves, but the
very existence of the frauds,
which might well have continued
to escape notice for years in the
absence of such prolonged and ex
pensive investigation as I have
been privileged to make. In the
dark shadows of secrecy not only
is the tax thief concealed, but
there is created a certain breed
ing place for graft and the corrup
tion of government officials.
President Wilson and Secretary Mc-
Adoo are empowered, by the terms of
the income tax law, to remove this
mantle of secrecy and make the tax
returns public, so that tbe tax thieves
may be known and the frauds ended.
PUBLICITY OF RETURNS is the
first esential of efficient collection.
During the Civil War the returns were
published and enormous attempts at
fraud were uncovered. When a reac
tionary congress at the end of the war
enacted that the return.- should be
kept secret, because publicity was
"obnoxious to the taxpayer," the
number of returns fell from 94.K57 in
IS7O to 74.77". in 1871, although the
latter year wa I one of unprecedented
prosperity.
Every man. woman and child in
these United States is the victim
of the tax thieves! If the tax had
been fully paid, the emergency
war taxes would have been
abolished, the tariff on sugar
which has increased the price 50
per cent in a few weeks would not
have been retained, and the Fed
eral Government would now have
in the vaults of the treasury the
milions which must be paid for
the increase of the army and
navy. The very men who have
called loudest for great army and
navy expenditures to protect their
property were at the same time
robbing the treasury of hundreds
of millions of dollars.
The income tax must be paid and
PAID IN FULL. In the face of the
array of evidence that has been pre
sented. PRESIDENT WILSON ANO
CONGRESS CANNOT REFUSE OR
POSTPONE EFFECTIVE ACTION.

PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY
McADOO HAVE FACTS IN
CASE AND POWER TO
REMEDY DEFECT
By Basil M. Manly
Noted American Economic Investi
gator.
The evidence in the greatest case of
the country—the United States Gov
ernment vs. the Income Tax Thieves —
has now been presented.
YOU —the American people—are the
jury. Your decision must now be ren
dered and your verdict enforced by
your representatives in congress and
the treasury department.
The evidence shows In brief: Eva
sion of taxes amounting in the aggre
gate to more than THREE IIUN
DRED AND TWENTY MILLION
DOLLARS. Every dollar of this enor
mous total is NEEDED tit once by the
Federal Government to pay the cost
of those great measures of social
service which are essential for real
national eficiency. If these millions
are not collected from the tax thieves
the PEOPLE—you—will have to pay
at the rate of SIXTEEN DOLLARS
FOR EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY.
Not only is the evidence conclusive
regarding the enormous size of these
frauds, but the IDENTITY of thieves
has in large measure been revealed.
The thieves who bave stolen these
millions from the treasury are, as a
class, the same men who, for the past
quarter century, have monopolized the
land and natural resources of our
|nation, concentrating the ownership
!and control of American corporations
lin the hands of a FEW, and, by mark
ing up the prices of commodities so
that they are now nearly 100 per cent
higher than in ISflfi, have drained into
| their own coffers the results of Aemr
ica's unparalleled productive capacity.
BOILERMAKERS ORGANIZE
Next Tuesday evening the boiler
makers of Everett will effect a per
manent organization, at the T«ibor
Temple.
Brother Joseph Reed, International
Deputy Organizer, is in Everett, and
expresses himself as well satisfied
with the progress being made in his
work. "Not only in Everett, but in
every live city in the United States,
the boys are falling into line," said
Brother Reed to a Journal representa
tive . "The Labor Forward movement
is sweeping the country with a wave
of enthusiasm not seen in years," he
added.
Seattle, Wash.—Officers of the In

; report steady gains in their effort to
enforce a wage scale adopted at their
'last convention. Compared with tin
pasi few years, shingle mills through
lout the Northwest are prosperous, but
despite this fact the shingle weavers
bave been forced to call numerous
strikes to remind mill owners of their
last year's promise to pay the 1907
rates. Tbe mill owners bave been
pleading that the high price of logs
makes this Impossible. The workers
reply that flour "ml meat arc also in
cluded in the high price list and that
wages must be Increased. As the
Shingle weavers have reorganized
their union and are thoroughly united,
the employers are paying the new
j rates, rather than see their mills idle.

U. S. Government Exploits the Workers
$2.30 A DAY WAGE
The Federal Employees' Union of
Washington, n. C, has been formed
since March 1, 1916, and is now com
posed of about five thousand em
ployees of the government of the
United States in the District of Co
lumbia. .We are affiliated with Amer
ican Federation of Tabor under Fed
eral Labor Union charter No. 14.632.
The organization is formed for the
purpose of improvement of the gov
ernment service and the conditions of
the government workers generally.
We hope to extend the organization
throughout the United States by the
formation of local unions in various
cities, and when these locals are suf
ficiently strong, organize them into a
national federation.
Some of the specific objects of the
organization which have been sug
gested are the protection of the work
ers from legislation inimical to their
interests, the extension of the merit
and civil service system to all govern
ment workers, the procurement of
legislation beneficial to such workers,

The first undertaking of the organ

than $3 per day for all government i

than a fourth at less than $840 a year.
