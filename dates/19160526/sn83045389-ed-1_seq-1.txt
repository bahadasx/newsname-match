other nation in similar circumstances
l recorded in history, and one which

! which has hitherto unstained my peo
ple through the trials of this terrible
|-war will Inspire them, and that it
will, with God's help, lead us and our
allies to a victory which shall achieve
the liberation of Europe."
The military service bill, or. as it
is better known, "the compulsion bill,"
was introduced in the llr.ti?..e of Com

the tactics to be pursued. The Mexi-i
can officer said he was seeking the con-j
ference on his own Initiative. He was
in telegraphic communication to-day
with General Ynez Salnsar, whose at
tempt to start a fresh revolution In I
Mexico met with failure. Salazar, now j
at Guzman, was promised amnesty and'

Secretary Baker to-night Issued the
follnwiner statement:
I "'The Dick hill provides as an of
; fense the failure on the part of the
I National Guard to present themselves
' for muster when called upon by the
i President to do so. One hundred and
i sixteen members of the Texas National
I Guard are reported to have failed so to
! present themselves. Under the Dick
! hill they would he guilty of failure
to present themselves for muster.
"When the pending legislation is ap- :
proved, and the militia of the Stales is
recognized and federalized thereunder,
the obligation of the enlisted men of
the National Guard will be to preserve j
the Constitutions of the United States '
and the respective States. When the !
President issues a call to the National i
Guard, the call will of its own force 1
muster each member of the National '
Guard into the Federal service, and it
will no longer be necessary for the :
men to 'present' themselves for
muster.
?GUILTY OF COMMITTING
i OFFENSE IN DICK RUJ.
"The offense, therefore, will be Im- '
possible, as it will not be required i
that the men should 'present' them- j
selves for muster. The Dick hill not :
being repealed, expressly remains in '
force. The 11?? men in question hav
ing taken an oath to preserve the Con- i
stltution of the United States and to
obey the lawful orders of the Governor
of Texas, and not having yet taken an
oath to obey the President as com
mander-in-chief. must still present i
themselves for muster. They are cuilty, >
therefore, of committing the t offense'
in the Dick bill, and are, therefore,
liable to punishment.
"1 have decided tA have the court
martial assembled by command of the
President, and ha\f asked General Fun- !
ston to recommend the members there-;
of. While I shall not prescribe, I shall
be inclined to recommend that the pro
ceedings be abated in cases where the i
men are willing to take the oath."

It was indicated at General Fun

militia organizations in those States
were far more demoralized than in
Texas. In Arizona only five officers

New Mexico was reported to be some

Rare Demonstration
of Unity Displayed in
House of Commons
Leaders of All Factions1
Flock to Standard of As- \
quith in Effort to Set
tle Irish Question.
LONDON*, May 25.?The House of Com
mon* lias rarely seen a demonstration
of greater unity than was displayed |
tliih afternoon when the leaders of all |
factions flocked to the standard of the'
Prime Minister in an effort to achieve .
a lasting settlement of the Irish ques- j
tlon.
This was the more remarkable, be-!
cause a heated and acrimonious do-'
bate, it had been predicted, would fol- i
low Premier Asqulth's expected state- j
ment regarding tho situation and the j
Rovernmeni'a proposals for a solution
of the problem. Mr. Asquitli's speech i
took an unexpected turn, for instead i
of Riving: details, he made an earnest j
plea for the settlement of the Irish |
question by agreement among the con
tending parties in Ireland, and an
nounced that David Lloyd George had
undertaken the delicatc task of bring-J
ing the hostile factions together.
The Premier concluded with an ap-1
peal that for a time all debate on the
question, both in the House of Com- I
mor.s and outside, be suspended, in viewi
of the adverse effect such argument;
might have on the difficult undertaking J
facing the government. I
The r'rciiier's speech was heard with :
intense interest by the members, and I
he had scarcely summed up when John I
Kedmond, the Nationalist leader, arose j
and acquiesced in the Premier's re-j
quest, adding, with a voice filled with j
emotion, his ardent desire for a. solu- j
tion of the difficulties of his country. |
Mr. Redmond was quickly followed j
by his political archenemy. Sir Rd-j
ward Carson, who tendered his sup-!
port to the proposition, and by the;
independent Irish leader. William
O'Brien, who did likewise.

These speeches effectively obliterated
party lines for the moment, and those
members who hatl come prepared t<>
attack '.he government fell in with the.
leaders.
The Prime Minister started by ex
pressing the hope that the disappear
ance of martial law would be speedy J
and complete.
Referring to the sacrifices that lri.?h- ,
men had made on behalf of the Hiitish;
empire during the present war, Mr.
Asquith said:
"Could we who represent Oreat.
Britain, or courd they who represent!
Ireland, tolerate the prospect that when j
this war was over and when we had.
by our joint efforts and sacrifices, as
we had hoped and believed we should,
achieved our end, that here at home
Irishmen should be arrayed against one
another in tho most tragic ;? 11 ? i most
debasing of all conflicts?internecine
domestic strife?
"I say to the House of Commons, to
the country and to the empire, that
the thought is inconceivable. It can
never be, for it would mean confes
sion of bankruptcy, not only of states
manship, but of patriotism."
Referring to tho home rule bill. Mr.
Asquith said:
"No one, so far as I know, has evor
desired or contemplated its coercive
application by one set of Irishmen
against another. What is now in this
great and domestic emergency of para
mount Importance is. that if it be pos
sible?and I hope it l.s possible?an
agreement such as we thought, in vain
before the war should bo arrived at
between those representing the dif
ferent interests and parties in Ire
land.
"I believe, oa I have already aaUU
that in Ireland Use'.f there is a deep
and genuine desire to obtain such an
agreement. The government?I speak
for all my colleagues, and some of us. !
be it remembered, in the past have
taken the most diverse possible views
! in regard to the question of Irish gov
ernment?are anxious, and more than
j anxious, to do everything in their
power to facilitate such results.

I LONDON. May 25.?David Lloyd
Geortif, stepping temporarily from the1,
! Ministry of Munitions to a sort of
j round-table conference to settle the
ltisii difficulty, is a striking illustra-!
' tion of how at all the great crises
land emergencies during the war this;
statesman has come to the front as
| a st!ong man and savior of the conn- j
i try. In the early days of the war,
he gained an enviable reputation for;
his capable, handling of the nation's!
finances, and then came to the rescue!
in the military emergency as head of:
the Ministry of .Munitions to provide
the army with shells.
Lately, it was undoubtedly his force
ful personality which converted tho
country, in the face of the strongest j
opposition, to universal military ser- (
vice. Now he steps into the breach to
solve one of the most difficult political
problems ever presented to British
statesmen?to reconcile the apparently;
irreconcilable sections of the Irish peo-j
pie and establish home rule in Ire-1

How Lloyd George will >e able i
to arrange a formal conference and

OK LACK OF SUCCESS
The trouble with the germs, Waite
said, was that they were not virulent
enough. He began to take an Interest
In bacteriology long before his mar
J riage. he explained. After he had given
! germs to Miss Peck for a while ho
j became discouraged, he asserted, be
; cause of his lack of success. He put
I the germs in her food, but he denied
i that he gave her arsenic.
j "Was there any arsenical fly-paper In
her room?" the dentist was asked.
I "Oh, yes," he answered, "I read some
j where of an arsenical fly-paper which
] If treated and put in a person's pocket,
! would cause death, so I got some and
| put It In her room."
I "Did you administer any bacteria to
; Mrs. Peek?"
] "Yes, soon after she arrived. I had
i been working on them for some time,
j and had them all ready for her."
"How often did you give them to
her?"
] "Quite often. I put them in her food
j on the first day she came, and she
? grew ill almost Immediately."
I He had given Mrs. Peck millions of
germs, he said. Asked how many kinds
j of cerms he administered to Mr. reck,
; Waite replied:
"Typhoid, diphtheria, pneumonia and
i others. I gave him a spray and put
i diphtheria and later pneumonia germs
i in it, and had him spray his throat
' every time ho went out. They had no
effect, and 1 tried to make them strong
er.
"I put water in the sheets of hla
i bed so that he would catch cold, but
i he didn't. I also put a chemical com
j pound in his room which would cre
i ate a poisonous gas. but it failed to
i produce results. One night I turned
; on the gas, but the superintendent of
j the building came up and turned it
i off.

| "I gave him arsenic a few days be
i fore he was planning to go away. I
got ninety grains, 1 think. I think it
was three or four days before Mr. Peck
died that I began to give him ursenic.
I gave him a little at first and in
creased the dose until all of it was
gone. I gave him the doses in his food.
?>nre or twice it was in eggnog, and
uncc in rice pudding, and then once in

Waite told of sleeping on the couch
on the night before his father-in-law's
