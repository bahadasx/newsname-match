WASHINGTON, May 2?. In a
length address, replete with legal
1 tations and statements f precedent,
former president William Howard
Taft today defended tin- plan for the
establishment of a permanent court
to deride all "justifiable questions"
arising between nations, as fathered
bj the League to Enforee Peace.
As president of the leasee, the
former chief executive, presided over
the first .annual convention of the
organization and replied in detail to
the objections that hive been raised
in various juarters against its plan.
The convention is one of the most
notable ever held in Washington and
"will come to a (Umax tomotrow
ntcht when Pres't Wilson Is expected
to -discuss international arbitration
and Indicate why he does not con
sider the time ripe for a renewal of
his original offer of mediation to the
T'uropean belligerents.
Tails Plan Valid.
In opening his address Mr. T;ift
explained that he had been assign
ed to reply to the constitutional ob
jections raised against the first and
third planks in the platform of the
faKii. The first provides for the
establishr.p'nt of a permanent court,
nml the third for the enforcement of
the decisions of such permanent
ouit by the military and naval
force of the signatories to the con
vention. In connection with the first
b.iection the claim has been raised
that it would be impossible to decide
what questions are and what are not
justifiable" and also that the pres
ident and senate have no authority.
Tinder the com tit ution. to enter into
such an agreement. The court would.
Mr. Taft explained, decide thN pes
tion itself upon its merits. The
right to enter into such an agree
ment, the speaker argued, is certain,
fie said:
The I'nited States is a nation,
mid from a foreign standpoint. ;
Kovert-isrn nation, without limitation
nf its sovereignity. It ma there
fore, through its treaty-making
power, consent to any agreement
with other powers relating t siib-
)-ets matter that are usually consid
ered and made the subject of treat
ies." Cito. Ptv"den(.
Mr. Taft then cited various pre-?-.ents
which he explained. showed
;he undisputable authority of the
president and senate to enter into
arbitration treaties abuii; the !;n-.:
mgsested by the league. Th sen
ate already was on record, he said,
qs favoring the establishment of a
permanent international prize court.

Interna tion.U News Service:
WASHINGTON. May 26. Close
friends of Justice Charles K. Hughes,
fully convinced that he is to be the
republican presidential nominee, will
endeavor to Influence him to resign
from the bench before the Chicago
convention assembles and to an
nounce his candidacy. They assert
that if he could do so now the tight
would be over.
The Hughes sentiment, they claim,
is spreading like wildrire through the
southern delegates and the Justice
has followers in every state delega
tion. So far Mr. Hughes positively
has refused to discuss politics even
with judicial associates. It was said
today by a fellow member of the su
preme court bench that there was
not a single member who had the
slightest idea what the justice's posi
tion wa-s.' He hap been good hu
moredly chalfed about his possible
nomination and has replied in kind,
but at no time has ho made a sin
gle statement that would permit any
line on his personal thoughts re
garding the republican nomination.
Say Hughes is Certain.
Progressive senatos who stuck by
the republican nartv in fie lat na
tional campaign thereby ir.inln?:
their reputations for party rgala.--ity,
are a unit in believing that the
nomination of Justice Hughes is a3
certain at Chicago as is the renom
ination of Pres't Woodrow Wilson at
St. Louis a week later. They are
devoting most of their attention to
questions of platform and several
prospective planks already have been
framed. Sen. William E. Rorah of
Idaho, will offer the Mexican plank,
which will denounce watchful wait
ing. He has held several confer
cenes with border senators on the
subject and it. is expected that the
platform declaration will assail all
the administration's moves in Mex
