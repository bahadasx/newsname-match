to remove frtun tho discipline of the
church tho clause which provides thd
ponalty of expulsion for church mem
bers who piny curds, dance and attend

More stringent regulations regard
ing tho remarriages by MethodUt min
isters of divorced persons arc provided
In n report submitted today by the
Committee on the State of tho Church.
Tho church has never recognized any
cause for dlvorco except adultery, and
has always forbidden remarriage In
any caso whore a divorced wlfo or hus
band Is living. By the proposed change
a minister who performs such a mar
riage Ib guilty of malamlnlstratlon nnd
Is to bo held answernble to his confer
ence. The total abstinence by Methodist
church members from tho uso of to
bacco Is urged In nnother report which
states:
"We record our solemn Judgment
thnt the habitual use of tobacco Is a
practice out of harmony with the best
Christian life."
