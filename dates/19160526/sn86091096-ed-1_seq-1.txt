DEMOCRATS 1ST
HPOCATELLO
Elder Chosen For National
Committeman
^ .Re'celebrated convention held
jPpcatello a week ago is a thing
past. Its influence, however,
is'far reaching. A body of machine
politicians cannot fool the people
all the time. When a Federal office
holder loses the confidence of the
people to such an extent that he
must resort to all the petty schemes
known only to the dishonest politi
cian to keep himself in power, it is
time that the people should wake
up.
The Day brothers, to whom the
party in question in the northern
part of the state owes more than
all other influences combined, have
become disgusted and have with
drawn from party leadership in this
part of the state. This is little
short of a calamity for the party.
Lacking the influence of these men
the Panhandle will become more
and more the caudal appendage of
the state. Of course the northern
part of the state carried off the
prize of National Committeeman
which was the bone of contention
but such a victory spells defeat.
Jerry Day withdrew from the con
test when he knew that the people
had little or no part in the matter
of electing a distributor of Federal
Pie.
It is true that Robert Elder was
elected with a majority of twelve
but this after his leadership had
been tested. A majority of twelve
out of a vote of 390 is at least not
complimentary. Following is the
way the matter looks to a man who
was on the ground:
"Conciliatory advances have been
made to the more hostile of the
defeated leaders but they refuse to
be comforted. The feeling is ap
parently deep rooted, and it may
have a far reaching effect. While
the methods of the so-called Elder
Nugent machine are roundly de
nounced, Governor Alexander comes
in for sharp censure for having, as
alleged, given it aid through his
appointees."
Governor Alexander has doubtless
gained with the Elder faction that
has always been unfriendly but he
has lost much more than he has
gained. Of course his endorsement
by the convention was merely per
functory for the Governor is the only
democrat in the state that could
have the ghost of a show of election.
Taking it all and in all the Re
publicans are smiling. They deem
it a safe bet that they will make a
clean sweep at the polls. Demo
crats seemed to have a bright fu
ture in this state. With President
Wilson at the head in national
affairs and Governor Alexander,
Sainted by the Pence-Nugent-El
i der faction, at the head of the state
ticket, there was a strong probabil
ity of a new order of things at the
state capital. Idaho is not likely
to effect the national election one
way or another but the party had a
splendid chance of making a record
in the state which stupid blunder
ing has nullified.
The day has passed for the so
called machine politician, and the
sooner the people take matters in
their own hands the sooner will
better political conditions prevail.
The Gazette sees a bright outlook
for the future, politically speaking,
for it believes that the time is near
when party affiliation will be of
little influence in selecting officials
to look after the people's interests.
The man untainted by graft of any
kind, the man of integrity and
honesty of purpose without regard
to party label, the man who believes
in the sovereignty of the people,
will be the peoples choice.
Purchased Barber Shop
Eugene Gibbs purchased the
Pastime Barber Shop from Tom
McDowell last Saturday. Under
the new management there will be
no pool tables in connection with
the barber shop. Mr. Gibbs, how
ever, will run a clothes pressing
establishment, laundry agency for
the Lewiston Laundry and will take
orders for tailored clothing for
men. He has many friends in
Kendrick and will no doubt do well.

KENDRjCK TODAY
Everybody Should Attend
This Game
There will be a baseball game to
day between the Clarkston and Ken
drick teams on the local diamond.
This is the first game played here
for a number of weeks and a good
crowd is expected. What the boys
need today is a good big bunch of
real live rooters who will make
enough noise and lend enough en
thusiasm to get the local team up
on their toes. The spectators at
the previous games played here
conducted themselves in a manner
much more suitable to a Wednes
day night prayer meeting than a
baseball game.
If Arnold Petrick, John Heath,
Marvin Long, Prof. Best and all the
rest of the used-to-be rooters are
not in the front row on the side
lines this afternoon making the
noise that they used-to-could, the
Kendrick ball team ought to be
blameless if it loses the game.
Half the sport of the game is the
enthusiasm displayed by the fans on
the bleechers. Bring your mega
phones and show your loyalty to
the team. If it is simply impossi
ble for you to take in the game on
account of previous engagements
etc., send fifty cents to the manage
ment—it will be worth that much
not to have you there. The band
is expected to accompany the crowd
to the ball ground. A little music
during the progress of the game
would be very much appreciated by
the crowd and might spur the boys
on to greater efforts. We want to
win this game.
Build Bridges In Latah
Moscow, May 22.—The Security
Bridge company of Lewiston and
W. A. Lauder of Moscow were the
successful bidders in the proposals
for the building of three bridges ip
Latah county. The county board
Saturday awarded the contract to
the Security Bridge company for
the construction of two steel bridges
with concrete abuttments.
The firm will build the bridge
across Pine creek between Kendrick
and Deary, a 60-foot span. The
price was $3425. The firm will
also build a 72-foot span steel
bridge across the Palouse river near
Harvard, the contract price being
$2675.
W. A. Lauder secured the con
tract for building the concrets
bridge across Four Mile creek at
Viola. The span will be 24 feet
and the contract price was $1865.
Rock Crusher Moved
F. A. Wallace moved the rock
crusher from the former location
to the place where the new grain
elevator is being built. By having
the crusher right on the ground
where the concrete is being made it
will save the expense of an extra
team. The rock to be used will
probably be hauled from Brady
gulch. Mr. Blackburn has offered
to donate all the rock needed to
erect the elevator.

ATTEND ÏÏIHÏENTIOH
W. O. W. Camps Convene
at Kellogg
Joday Long and Charlie McKeev
er attended the W. O. W. conven
tion held at Kellogg, May 17.
Both the Wardner and Kellogg
Camps were lavish in their enter
tainment of the delegates and the
Kendrick delegation spent a very
enjoyable time at the convention.
Kellogg is booming on account of
the big smelter being installed and
everybody is optimistic in regard to
the future prosperity of that sec
tion of the country, Most of the
mines are working at full capacity,
some even working three shifts a
day.
One unfortunate condition exist
ing in the mining belt is the large
number of unemployed men who
come with the expectation of get
ting a job in the mines. The fact
has been too extensively advertised
that some of the mines are paying
a bonus above the average wage.
This bonus is not paid on account
of the scarcity of labor but because
the mines are making such splendid
returns that the stockholders wish
to give a part of the dividends to
their employees. Hundreds of men
are going to the different camps
every day in search of employment
but are forced to leave as there are
not jobs enough to go around.
Mr. Long and Mr. McKeever
visited a while with Ramsey Walker,
Dick James, J. R. Hall, Joel Hall
and other people formerly of Ken
drick. Joel Hall has a responsible
position with the Coeur d'Alene
Hardware Co. at Wallace. They
also saw M. C. Normwal at Coeur
d'Alene, who used to run the St.
Elmo Hotel in Kendrick a number
of years ago. On the return trip
they spent a day in Spokane where
they visited with Tom Long. Tom
has a good job in one of the city
meat markets.
To Inoculate Seed
Coating the seed of legumes with
inoculated soil before planting is a
simple method of insuring soil ino
culation at slight cost. County
agents in Illinois have found ordi
nary furniture glue effective in
holding particles of inoculated
soil to the seeds. This method gives
each individual seed some of the
particles of inoculated soil which
it carries with it when it is planted.
The scheme requires but a small
amount of inoculated soil and costs
but a few cents an acre. The
method is described in Farmers'
Bulletin 704 of the department.
Dissolve two handfuls of furni
ture glue for every gallon of boil
ing water and allow the solution to
cool. Put the seed in a washtub
and then sprinkle enough of the
solution on the seed to moisten but
not to wet it (1 quart per bushel
is sufficient) and stir the mixture
thoroughly until all the seed are
moistened.
Secure the inoculated soil from a
place where the same kind of plants
as the seed are growing, making
sure that the roots have a vigorous
development of nodules. Dry the
soil in the shade, preferably in the
barn or basement, and pulverize it
thoroughly into a dust. Scatter
this dust over the moistened seed,
using from one-half to 1 gallon of
dirt for each bushel of seed, mixing
thoroughly until the seed no longer
stick together. The seed are then
I ready to sow.
A. K. Carlson went to Spokane
Tuesday and returned Wednesday
with a new Chevrolet car. He has
taken the agency for the Chevrolet
in this territory.

1000 Acres Beans Planted
on Cream Ridge
Dent, May 21.—In the Cream
Ridge section alone this year more
than 1000 acres will be planted to
beans. Each year the bean area in
north Idaho seems to widen rapidly,
and sections which a few years ago
were considered too cold and having
a too high altitude for the maturing
of beans, are now fully initiated in
to the bean growers brotherhood.
Mrs. S. A. Sutton, of Teakean,
has demonstrated that beans can be
grown in the Teakean-Cavendish
district with success. This enter
prising lady has made possible that
which men had long considered was
impossible, and she has the beans to
show as proof positive of her claims.
With the price of beans about seven
cents the pound at this time, many
farmers are planting large acreages
this season, the view being held
that the European war will cause
the price to continue high the com
ing season.
What was only a poor mountain
trail that was truly hazardous to
ride a horse over a few years ago
between Julius Steiner's farm and
Ahsahka, at the mouth of the North
Fork of the Clearwater river, has
now given place to one ?>f the best
river highways in north Idaho.
The Dent country seems on the
eve of substantial development.
The Weyerhauser people have been
making purchases at Big Island and
other places along the North Fork;
a Mr. Carr will install a store at
the William Durass place at the
mouth of Elk creek; school houses
have been erected ; homes are being
hewn out of the forest, and what
a few years ago was but little less
than a wilderness is now a thriving
and prosperous community.

HOLD SESSION
FOR EARNERS
Meeting Planned for June
12-14 at Coeur d'Alene
Boise, Ida.— W. G. Scholtz, dir
ector of farm markets for Idaho,
has issued a call for a conference
of North Idaho farmers to be held
at Coeur d'Alene June 12-14. It
is announced that special rates
have been granted by the railroads
for the occasion. The call says:
"To the Farmers of Northern
Idaho: In recognition of the fact
that the farmers of north Idaho
have very little in common, com
mercially, with other sections of
the state, a special conference of
growers is hereby called, to meet
at Coeur d'Alene June 12, 13, and
14, to consider those problems
peculiar to the northern part of
the state.
"As was the case at the statewide
conference held at the capitol in
February, this meeting will be not
only for farmers, but also by far
mers. There will be no 'cut and
dried' program. While there will
be some addresses by prominent
authorities arranged for in ad
vance, the plan is primarily for an
informal exchange of ideas.
"Among the matters to be given
consideration at this meeting will
be the legislative needs of the far
mer; present market abuses and
possible remedies; co-operative buy
ing and selling and best methods of
procedure.
"In undertaking the establish
ment and administration of this
state department of farm markets
I have dedicated myself to an enor
mous task. I need all the friendly
counsel and constructive criticism I
can get. I am just as anxious to
assist the producers in the north as
those in the southern part of the
state; but with the limited facilities
at the disposal of the department
this first term it must be realized
that benefits should only be expect
ed by those who show a disposition
to co-operate. So that I may se
cure a better understanding of the
needs in the northern counties, and
so that a better understanding may
be secured by the farmers as to the
possible benefits available this de
partment, the conference at Coeur
d'Alene is being called, and it is
hoped that every farming commun
ity will assume its responsibility in
this matter and do its part by send
ing representatives to the meeting,
"It is my desire and determina
tion to make this conference, as
well as this department, as nearly
what the farmers want it to be as
possible. A large and representa
tive attendance is hoped for."
