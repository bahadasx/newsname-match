at Enthusiastic Meeting at Reardon
- Cafe on Tuesday Evening
That the citizens of Greenlee coun
ty are enthusiastically in favor of the
early construction of good roads, east i
and wes.t and north and south, con- j
necting the agricultural and mining 1
districts of this county, with adjacent !
counties, both in Arizona and New
Mexico, was evidenced in full force at
a banquet arranged by the Greenlee
County Chamber of Commerce and
held at the Reardon Cafe on Tues
day evening.
The meeting was one of the most
important ever held by this organi
sation, both in point of attendance
and representation of taxpaying in
terests. Among the distinguished visitors
present from a distance were S. J.
Kidder, General Manager of the Mo
gollon Mines Co., of Mogollon, N. M.;
Hon. Lamar Cobb, Arizona State En
gineer, George A. Foote, Chairman oi
the Board of Supervisors of Graham
county, Adolph Young, County En
gineer of Graham county; Mr. Lay
ton. Clerk of the Board of Graham,
Chairman Witt, of the Greenlee Coun
ty Board; Jos. Conn, editor of the
Duncan News; J. R. Fowler, Presi
dent of the Duncan Commercial Club,
and others from Duncan, Morenci,
and Metcalf . In all sixty-five mem
bers of the Greenlee County Commer
' cial Club and guests were seated at
the dinner.
The affair was arranged to listen to
a statement from 'Mr. S. J. Kiddei
regarding the co-operative plan ol
constructing a highway from Clifton
to Mogollon and also a report .from
State Engineer T.mar Cobb regarding
Federal aid and Forestry approprla-
tiflnA fnr hitrhwav tiiiilrlinc in A T-i-
. zona, in addition to a reiort- from
him on the probability of the ' early
construction of the Clifton-Solomon-ville
State Highway. In addition to
the speeohes made by Messrs. Kid
dei and Cobb, the Chamber of Com
merce listened attentively to a re
.ponse by Norman Carmichael, Gener
al Manager of the Arizona ' Copper
Co. Ltd.; Adolpbi . Young, County
Engineer of Graham; George Foote,
of Graham; W. T. Witt, of Greenlee;
J. R. Fowler, of Duncan; and Dell M.
Potter, of Clifton.
At the conclusion of the repast W.
B. Kelly, President of the Chamber
of Commerce Introduced Hon. A. R.
Lynch as Toastmaster for the occas
ion and in introducing the several
speakers, "the little giant" was at his
best. . After poking fun at the com
mittee composed of Messrs. Kelly,
Webster and Redd, who visited the
mine managers at Mogollon several
weeks ago, Mr. Lynch introduced Mr.
Kidder.
Mr. Kidder made a business pre
sentation of the difficulties which con
tinually surround the transportation
over poor roads of mining supplies
and merchandise between Mogollon
and Silver City, a distance of approxi
mately eighty miles and stated that
for some time his company had under
consideration a shorter and better out
let from Mogollon to Clifton, thereby
a effecting a saving in haulage charges
"and also giving the Mogollon district
an outlet to an agricultural section.
Mr. Kidder stated that the roads in
this section were a revelation to him
and that he was personally convinced
that the road between Clifton and Mo
gollon was feasible and that if the
mining companies and others interest
' ed in the Mogollon district woutd be
Justified in making the expenditure
luuiMflnrv tr tftrfeTiatrnnt. thA rnad from
the Arizona line to Mogollon provided
point". Mr. Kidder estimated that
the haul distance could be reduced ap
proximately twenty miles over the
present Silver City route. His ad
dress was listened to closely by all
present and the concensus of opinion
was that it would only be a short time
before the Mogollon Mining District
would be connected directly with
Greenlee county.
Mr.' Kidder was followed by Mr.
Cobb who told the assemblage of the
progress made at this session of Con
gress for national aid for state high
way construction and the appropria
tion of ten million dollars additional
tor highway construction within For
est Reserves. Mr. Cobb Is a member
of the Executive Committee of the
Association of Highway Engineers in
the United States and has just return
ed from Washington and is firmly con
vinced that Arizona will receive
Federal aid in a substantial sum at
the hands of the present congress.
Reverting to local affairs Mr. Cobb
brought the good news, and was ap
plauded, when he stated that he was
now prepared to begin immediate
construction of the State Highway
between Clifton and Solomonville,
and with the co-operation of the
Beards of Graham and Greenlee coun
ty, would have a force employed

ATTEMPTS LIFE
House Blown Up in North Clifton
and Owner has Narrow Escape from
Death.
About 11 o'clock Monday night the
residents of North Clifton near the
pump station were aroused from their
slumbers by a terrific explosion which
was thought by some to have been a
blast, but upon investigation by the
sleepy neighbors, it was found that
the home of Jose Jurado had been
dynamited with the evident inten
tention of taking the life of the occu
pant. The explosive was undoubtedly
placed under the man's bed on the
floor, the person gaining access to
the house, as the force of the explo
sion was in a downward direction.
The bed and the room in which it was
situated were a wreck and the side
of the house was blown away, and
had the occupant been in bed at the
time his fate would not be. at all
problematical.
Jurado, who works for the Shannon
Copper company, was on night shift,
and it was his usual custom to arrive
home about eleven o'clock, but on'
Monday night some good fairy must
have been on the job watching over
his destiny, as he did not arrive home
until some time after 11:30. It ap
pears that whoever was responsible
for the outrage was closely acquaint
ed with his habits and had his evil
intentions not miscarried ' Jurado
would have been killed.
An investigation of the affair was
made and early Tuesday morning
Jesus Apodaca was taken into cus
tody, it being believed by the officers
that he was cognizant of the plot to
wreck the house and had good rea
son to seek Jurado' s life. It is un
derstood that for some time past Ju
rado had been living with Apodaca's
wife and that several months ago the
matter was aired in the local justice
court with what was supposed to
have been an amicable adjustment,
but it seems that Jurado has persist
ed in his illicit relations with the wo
man to the present time much, against
the wishes of her, husband. It is al
so stated that Apodaca has at differ
ent times made threats against the
life of Jurado if he did not cease his
atentions to the former's wife.
Bt is the supposition that patience
had ceased to be a virtue with Apo
daca and that his pent-up anger
against the destroyer of his home led
him to make the a tempt on his life.
Apodaca is now confined in the
county jail awaiting a hearing.
Big Benefit Exhibition
The Retail Clerks Association, of
Clifton, under the direction of Al

Rev. Wm. J. Gordon returned on
Tuesday of this week from Phoenix,
where he attended the State Temper
ance Federation. He reports an en
thusiastic meeting, in which several
measures pertaining to prohibition
were discussed and mea fares were

USING THE LATEST STYLE TRENCHES
FIRE DESTROYS
KARIBO HOME
North Clifton Home Destroyed in
Short Time. .But Very Little of the
Contents Saved.
The home of Charles Karibo in
Nirth Clifcon was aln o-si totstily
destroyed by fire Wednesday after
noon, but a few of the personal belong
ings being saved. The alarm was
turned in about three o'clock and
before the Clifton fire boys had
reached the scene the house was in
a mass of flames and a strong wind
whipped the blaze in every direction.
At the beginning it looked as though
all the houses in the immediate
neighborhood were doomed to the
same fate but after the arrival of the
fire department, combined with ex
cellent water pressure.three streams
of water were turned upon the build
ing and the flames were subdued.
The house was completely gutted
and only the walls were left standing,
and OR account jof the strong wind at
the time it is a miracle that the
whole structure was not completely
destroyed. It is not known how the
fire originated but is thought to have
been caused by an over heated stove.
None of the contents of the house was
saved except a piano although a good
ly amount of clothing and personal
effects were rescued, among which
was a quantity of jewels and money.
The house was owned by Mrs. Ar
chie Morrison and it is understood
that no insurance was carried on
the building.
The flames bad scarecly been sub
dued when a second alarm was turned
in and this time a dwelling directly
in front of the Karibo home was dis
covered to.be on fire on the roof.
This was shortly put out and the ex
citement in that end of town was
abated.
Too much caution cannot be taken
at this time of the year to guard
against fires, as -the dry condition of
the buildings and the high winds
might .easily result in a most dis
astrous conflagration. '
As chief executive of the town,
Mayor Fraser, in behalf of the citi
zens, wishes to commend the Clifton
Fire boys and the Clifton Water com
pany ' upon the adequate fire protec
tion recently given them. The water
service, in the case of the two big
fires in the past week, has been- ex
cellent and the pressure has been all
that could be asked for and the citi
zens now feel more secure from the
ravages of fires than heretofore.

GREENLEE COUNTY
300 Registered Voters Up To Date
Registration Figures of This Dis

i timates that the registration for
I Greenlee county will exceed 3,200
names. ' In 1914 the total registration
,-as 3,300.
Under the law the time allowed for
this accomplishment is about five
i months. A little further figuring will
produce the further facts that an
I average of 650 names in duplicate
: for each of these five months must be
I obtained by the county recorder, who
ie entrusted with this important func
tion under the law, in order to get
all these names in the office . A glance
at the task ahead when the name is

blanks is given to the voter and one
sent to the .recorder's office. What
is done before the receiption of the
blank at the recorder's office is noth
ing compared to what has to be done
afterwards. Two registers must be
made up, each containing a copy of
the signature of the voter. One of
these names is pasted- into the great
register of the county and the other
into the precinct register. But this
is not all. Along side of each name
pasted in these registers, and they
must correspond to the, merest detail,
is the number of the voter, his age,
liesorintion of anv deformities, and the
political party to whlcfel he is affiliated

and names to be pasted and fifteen
hundred descriptions, etc., to be cop
ied twice. The object of all this is to
protect the ballot and the system of
voting. The blanks are not destroyed,
but are kept numbeied and filed and
stored away in the vault of the re
corder's ofice as a part of the records.
When the registration closes on
September 2, the precinct registers
are made up- and sent to the
various precincts to be used for the
primary election, on September 12th.
They are then returned and the re
gistration is again opened and the
books kept up to date with the names,
etc., of the voters who register after
that time until October 15th when the
books are finally closed for this year.
The books are then prepared for the
general election on November 7th.
A force of extra help is always em
ployed during the registration period
and a force of extra deputies are ap
pointed for registration duty around
the county.
Up to the present time there has
been a total of 300 registered.

RECRUIT MANY
MEMBERS
Enthusiastic Meetings Held In CI ft
ton, Morenci and Metcalf on Men
day, Tuesday and Wednesday Of
This Week in the Interest of ON
ganized Labor Largely Help CauM.
The three days' campaign in th4
interest of organized labor known M
the "Labor Forward Movement" wtl
opened at Clifton on Monday after
noon at which time a large crowd of
men and women gathered on the
plaza to listen to the speeches and
band selections.
A short preliminary talk on th
days' activities was given on the pla
za shortly after noon by John L.
Donnelly, vice-president of the Art
zona State Federation of Labor, who
is now stationed in this district. A
meeting for the ladies especially had.
been advertised for 4:30 o'clock la
the afternoon at which time Mr. Don
nelly chose as his subject "Woman'"
Relation to the Labor Movement."
Several hundred union men, headed
by the Morenci band, marched from
union headquarters on Chase .Creek
and assembled on the plaza for tha
speechmaking. Several prettily de
corated floats and carriages were also
in line, noticeable among which: were
those representing the New Bakery
and Julian Gabaldon.
The afternoon SDeakine was nnened
by some of the well known MexioaaV.
members of the union, among whom
were three lady speakers, after
which' Mr. Donnelly addressed the
audience on the above subject. Mr.
Donnelly was at his best on this oc
casion and treated his subject, in ;
thoroughly capable manner.
In opening Mr. Donnelly stated that
woman's work in the field of ' labor
had reached such proportions in the
lest few years that she deserved aa
much recognition among the labor or
ganizations, and in fact in ajl the in
dustrial pursuits of the world, as the
men, and that this was becoming to
be recognized more and more as the.
labor' movement progressed. He re
ferred to the early days when the wo-
men labored1 at the - spinning jenny
in order to make clothes for the tarn- -fly.
TbeyRl8olabored side by-side
with the men in the fields and thus
bore their share of the industrial la
bore which- have from that time to
tha nraoort haan in rrnn n cr mi -Vi
case of a certain New England town
in which today .the ' women . factory
workers outnumbered the men to a
great extent, and in fact the women
did the work in the mills and fac
tories while the men attended to the
household duties. In enumerating -several
other- instances of the kind
Mr. Donnelly clearly showed the part .
women are taking today in - the in-
dustrial world and ' that they should ,
receive and that they are demanding -recognition
for their- services that.

just. "Through the evolution of la
P T I 'n Ji ,k..
bor and the economic conditions of the
world today woman is - laboring by
the side of man," concluded Mr; Don--nelly,
"and In the future she will take
her rightful place in having a voice
in t'de affairs of which she is playing
so important a part:"
At the conclusion of Mr. Donnelly's
remarks other speeches were made in
Spanish after which the parade once
more formed and with the band lead
ing, marched through- North Clifton
and from there to Shannon Hill. The
day was concluded with two big
dances in the evening, one at' tae
Prlncess Theatre and one at the- At
hambra on Chase Creek.
Later in the evening at union head
quarters a large number of new mem
bers were taken into the ranks and It
is understood that the Labor- Forward
Movement has added to the unions of
the district something over 800 new;
members. It was stated by a- lead
ing union worker that there are now
but a -few workers of the district out
side or the union and that these would
soon eome to see the light and join the
brotherhood of' workers,
brotherhood of workers.Of this number
Clifton contributed 250, Morenci 45,
and Metcalf 145.
On Tuesday the big day was at Mo
renci where practically the same pro
gram was carried out and a great
many recruits were added to the union
roster. The three days' campaign
was concluded with Metcalf as the ob
jective point. The labor leaders of
the district feel that the movement
in this section was productive of a
great deal of good and that the cause
of labor was much- advanced by the
concerted action for new members.
