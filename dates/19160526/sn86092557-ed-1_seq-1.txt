INIFIM1
CHAIR CASE
It Will Be He'd Tomorrow
i Before the Supreme
Court
The final hearing of the Fairmont
Charter case will be held tomorrow in
the supreme court of West Virginia.
The style of this case is Reuben An
derson against Anthony Bowen and
others. The Republican committee
representing the Republican party or
Fairmont were also allowed to become
parties to the rriginal suit and this
final appeal is on the plea of this com
mittee.
The caso as originally heard in the
circuit court before Judge Haymond
was decided in favor of the plaintiff,
who being used as an agent of the
Democratic party brought a suit to
prevent tho Fairmont city officials
ironi allowing the new Charter to go
into effect. The application of the Re
publican city committee to be allowed
1 to become parties to the suit was re
fused by Judge Haymond at the first
hearing. An appeal to tho Supreme
court the case was certified hack to
the circuit court for a new trial grant
ing permission to tho Republican party
representatives to file their answer to
tho bill of the plaintiff and to be con
sidered as partfes to the suit. The
case however was again won by the
plaintiff at the second hearing.
The present appeal is on the general
merits of the case and the Supreme
court will consider all the evidence
as hown in the transcript of the case
and theii decision will be final. The
present appeal was takon by the de
fendant appellants -wHo are parties to
the suit.
The local attorneys who represent
the defendant appellants are John W.
Mason, Jr., W. S. Mereith and Allison
S. Fleming. These men have prepared
a brief of their case and this will be
submitted to the court tomorrow. As
tho attorneys are only allowed thirty
minutes for their argument the local
attorneys likely will not go to Char
leston to attend the hearing. If the
opposing counsel agre to submit the
case on brief this will be done.

FROM GRANT DiSI
County Court Will Consider
Them as An Applica
tion.
Two petitions from the Grant dis
trict voters were received today by
the county court asking for a new
special election for bond issue to bo
used for the construction of good
roads. The two petitions together
with a third which has been circulated
in Grant district will be considered
as one petition as the text on wording
of each is the same. At a late hour
this afternoon the third petition had
not been presented and no official ac
tion will bo taken by the court until
the third one is received, as the two
that arc at present in their posses
sion contain less than the requited
number of voters and freeholders. At
least fifty names of taxpayers and vot
ers must be appended to Eptittions of
this nature before the court can act
upon them.
The new petitions specify practi
cally the same roads to be built as
wero named in the old petition /ithi
the difference that the kind of road j
under the new petition is to be all
of macadam of fourteen and twelve
foot widths except two short sections
loading from tho Hunsaker bridge and
from the town of Monongah which are
to be built of brick. The sum to be
raised by the bond issue is the same
as under the former petition being
$95,000. The petition specfles tat any
money remaining after the specified
roads are built is to be used propor
tionately in extending the various sec
tions that are now specified.
A delegation of citizens from the
town of Millersvllle appeared before
the court this morning and asked that
the road through their village be grad
ed for a distance of about 500 feet.
The citizens of this community, which
Is Just across the river from the Mo
nongah Glass company's plant at
Twelfth street, have raised a subscrip
tion to build a sidewalk through their
town and are waiting until the road
is graded and repaired so that the
proper location of the wulk can be
determined. The members of the court
went out at noon hour an? riewed
the road, and the work of putting it
In shape so that the walk can be built
will likely be begun as early as pos
sible.
Several applications for pauper al
lowances wero considered by the court
today and increases, will likely bo
granted in several Instances.

II CANDIDATES
FILE STATEMENTS
Failure to Report Election
Expenses Incurs a Se
vere Penalty.
Only two of the financial statements j
of candidates -whose names will ap
pear on the ballots in this county have
been filed with the county clerk up
to the present time. These are the
statements of Ira A. Aikens, democrat
ic candidate for the nomination of the
party for the house of delegates, and
E. W. Nichols candidate for member
of the board of education in Wlnfleld
district.
i The corrupt practices act of the log
I islative session of 1915 requires the
| candidates in the primary election to
file'their financial expenditure state-j
mentB with the clerk of each county
not less than seven nor more than
fifteen days before the date of the
election and again thirty days after
the election they are required to file
another expense statement. In case
the candidate fails to file his financial
statement as required his name is not
placed on the official ballot at the gen
eral election iollowing the primary
and the law also prvides that the
ficer. delegated to receive the state
clerk of the county court or othor of
ment of expense shall forty days after
the primary give notice to the prose
cuting attorney of the county who
shall prosecute the delinquent candi
date for misdemeanor. The minimum
penalty Is a fine of fifty dollars and a
jail sentence of not more than six
months.
Practically every candidate in this
county is awate of the serious conse
quences of his failure to file such a
statement and the btatement^ will
likely be coming in rapidly now that
the. time left to file the statements Is
only five days. Of the two statements
filed with the county court Mr. Aikens
waB only for ten dollars while that
of Mr. Nichols stated that nothing had
as yet been spent In his behalf. The
ten dollars listed as Aikens expense
in this county was for the fee required
as his share of the primary election
expense. For the board of education
In the district no fee Is required.
