Be Brought to Justice
San Francisco, July 27. With one
bomb suspect under arrest and Mrs.
Belle Lavin detained for examina
tion, the police today sent requests
all over the country for the detention
of Thomas -Mooney, who, they be
lieve, may give tbem further Informa
tion regarding the bomb outrage here
which has already cost nine lives. J
Such close secrecy has been main
tained regarding the activities of the
special bomb squad of the depart
ment that the police will not even
admit that Warren K. Billings Is un
der srrest, although from other
sources It Is known that he Is.
Billings, who has served a term
In Folsom prison for carrying dyna
mite on a messenger train, wa taken
Into custody at Lane hospital when
he appeared at the free clinic there
for treatment. . No newapaper men
have been permitted to see him and
a "sweating" which was begun yes
terday continued today.

police hurrjedjo the lodging house

house In which James MoNamara
and M. A. Schmidt stayed when they
were planning the dynamiting of the
Los Angeles Times building six years
ago. At that time Mra. Lavin was
detained. She was cross examined at
length today.
The search of Billings' room dis
closed two hundred steel-nosed cart
ridges of .22 and .32 calibre, hid
den In a tin box. According to the
police, these coincide with the bul
lets picked up near Stewart and Mar
ket streets Saturday after the bomb
explosion. An automatic pistol was
also found In the room.

police, it was stated today, la that
the infernal machine was exploded
In an effort to kill or malm represen
tatives of the United Hallway who
were marching In the parade.
Mooney, who recently attempted to
start a strike of United Railways'
platform men, Is wanted. In the be
lief that he may have Information
that will be of value to the police in
this connection.

board for glory, but who makes nig
living by practicing medicine, has
been ealled to duty by yonr Unel
Samuel. After next Tuesday, and
for at least the next three months,
ihe school director-mayor-physician
will be Lieutenant Jesse P. Truax,
M. D., detailed for doty at the United -States
army ' aviation school at Saa
DiegO. -j !-r . ... .
(Before coming to Grants Pass In
1910, Dr. Truax had been 12 years
with the medical service in the amy.
He enlisted In 1898 when the little
affair with Spain was settled, and
after that he was transferred to Fort ,
Robinson,, Nebraska; Fort Wright,,
at Spokane: to Puget Sound, to
Alaska, and other places where the
soldier boys might need pills or
splints, v iHe was also on duty with
the. army ..when the labor troubles"
were seething in the Coeur d'Alene
mining ; district, and patched .up
broken noses and limbs there. Then
the doctor was ordered to the Philip-'
pines, but' with: a growing family to
take his attention, he concluded to
sever his connection. with army life
and establish himself in private prac
tice. He therefore resigned his com
mission and located in Grants Pass.'
Here he not only established him
self in a most excellent practice but.
became also a public-spirited citizen
as well, serving upon the school
board with credit, and last December
being elected mayor by a large ma
jority. ;::.:.
t Last March Uncle Bam. who keeps
track of men who may some day be
needed In the service, wrote the doc
tor to know if he would again enter
the service it called up. The reply ,
that went back was that it his coun
try needed him he was ready to re
spond to the call provided the ser
vice was in the field or at a base hos
pital, or where he could see active
duty.. Now. the doctor has. been or
dered. to report for duty at the army
aviation school at San Diego, and he
will depart for San Diego next Tues- .
day.'" ' '
' Dr. Truax has agreed to remain
in the service for 90 days only unless
there should be war. In which event
he would remain as long as needed.
But if peace Is maintained he will re
turn to Grants Pass at the end of his
90 days of service and will resume
his practice here. In the meantime
It is expected that hie official posi
tions will be held open for him here,
and that Councilman Demaray, as
president of the council, will be act
ing mayor. The doctor's family, will
remain In this city during his ab
sence.
The doctor expects that the prac
tice that will come under his direc
tion at the aviation school will be
most valuable to him, and will aid .
him materially when he resumes
private practice. For the past year
he has been keeping in touch with
the army department through a cor
respondent course of study, and the
officers of the medical corps gave him.
a rating of 98 at Its conclusion.
Will VnbllHh Traffic Rule
A copy of the traffic ordinance will
be published In tomorrow's paper, by
the city council. This is being done
to acquaint the people wUh the rule
and a good plan would be to cut
these out and paste them where they
lean be observed. '
