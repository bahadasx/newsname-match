TUCUMCARI, QUAY COUNTY, NBW MEXICO, THURSDAY, JULY 27. HUG

TO THE CITIZENS
OF
Wednesday night, July HUli, I held
n meeting at the KII;h Auditorium,
CIovIh, New Mexico. Fully one thous
and people were present. I paid $10.00
for the use of the Auditorium.
The Methodist ladieR nerved punch
frco to the audience, I paid for the
punch and gave $25.00 to the ladles
to use in a chnrltahtc way as they Haw
fit, as compensation for their services
In making and serving punch. These
ladles certainly made a success out of
their part of the program.
I bought and paid for I00 clears for
the men to smoke. We had fine music,
it was furnished by the Clovis Girls'
Hand, I paid $10.00 for that.
The objects and purpose. of this
meeting were to explain to the people
of Clovis the automobile manufactur
ing business and the plan of the Pnn
Motor Company, now organizing.
I called on as many of the business
men and bankers of Clovis In person
as I could and gave them personal in
vitation to be present.
Mr. Alex Shipley, President of the
Clovis National Hank, was one of the
men invited by mo to bo present. He
asked me if I would allow the audience
to ask questions or make talks in re
gard to my proposition. I told him 1
would be glad to extend to anyone
such a courtesy, because our plan is
so clean and perfect, in all its details
that I would gladly invite discussion.
This conversation was about two
days before the meeting. Mr. Shipley
immediately begun to hold caucuses
and meetings among certain of his
friends for the purpose of interfering
with the success of our business in
Clovis. Curry County, New Mexico,
and elsewhere. Why?
Mr. P. E. Jordan, Cashier of the
First National Hank of Portales, and
Mr. J. K. Heese, Cashier of the Por
tales Hunk, had subscibed for some of
the stock In the Pan Motor Company
and each of those gentlemen gave me
a letter so stating, and they had taken
some time to think it over before giv
ing me these letters. I showed Mr.
Shipley these letters. He neglected
his business to ride down to Portales
and poison the minds of these two
gentlemen ngainst me and my proposi
tion. Why? He induced them to
appear at the meeting and ask for
their letters back. Why?
What kind of influence has Mr.
Shipley over these two gentlemen? I
showed Mr. Alex Shipley the letter
given me by Mr. George Baxter,
Cashier of the Frst National Hank of
Melrose. The day before our meeting
inCfclovis Mr. Haxtcr had given his
personal permission to two of our
salesmen, Mr. Wigle nnd Mr. Kelly,
to use his own letter on his own part
ner in Melrose who also bought some
stock. Mr. Shipley got in touch with
Mr. Haxtcr and had him to join these
other mentioned hankers in the meet
ing and ask for his letter back. Why?
I also showed Mr. Shipley the joint
letter signed by Mr. S. .1. Hoykin,
President, and Mr. A. W. Skarda,
Cashier of the Fir National Hank
of Clovis
At 8:00 oVto-i in the morning of
the day of our meeting Mr. Skarda
t 'd me that he and Mr. Hoykin pre
ferred that I not use their letter
locally, because they had been criti
cised by other local bankers for giv
ing it, but they did not object to its
use elsewhere, because our proposi
tion was all right. He told me to come
back at 11:00 o'clock, because ho had
some information for me- I went hack
at 11:00 o'clock all right, he told me
that Mr. Shipley and his friends were
certainly "framing up" on me. That
night, to my surprise, I saw Mr. Hoy
kin and Mr. Skarda in tho enemy's
company. Someone told me they had
been lined up through indirect per
sonal influence Mr. Shipley brought
to bear on them. None of them got
their letters back, of course.
I made about a two hour talk and
my talk was well received. Mr. Ship
ley "butted in" a few times and want
ed to talk. When I llnished we had
some live music, and Mr. Shipley took
the floor. Instead of discussing my
proposition he began a harangue about
some oil scheme of several years ago
that had turned out badly for the in
vestors. He had arranged for certain
of his friends who were stationed in
different parts of the audience to pull
off a demonstration every few minutes,
when he was talking. Ho then turned
to another proposition and unmerci
fully assailed it. He then attacked
mo personally. Ho undertook to re
flect on my good intentions, integrity,
ability and without pointing out nny
reasons told the people they would lose
their money if they bought stock in
the Pnn Motor Company. Ho told
them he had appointed himself as
their guardian to save them from buy
ing stock in the Pan Motor Company,
or any other organization or Promo
tion Company that they wero all
bad. He (lid not produce any logic to
support his position, just mado wild
assertions. At a certain time during
his address he turned to thoso above
mentioned five bankers and said "All

EXCAVATION WORK ON
ELEVATOR STARTED
.Mr. Light, of the Light Elevator
Co., with headquarters at Liberal, Ks.,
came in last Saturday morning to
make arrangements for the building
of their new elevator here. Hu was
preceded one day by the construction
boss who hired teams and men to be
gin work Monday.
The bottling works building was
moved away and excavation work lie
gun. Mr. Light said it would take a
month to complete the building ready
for business, but he has a buyer com
ing to Tucumcari from Liberal and
he expects 1.1m to canvass the wheat
belt wheie he will buy grain and ship
it direct from Tucumcari to the market
until the elevator in built. Mr. Light
likes competition and will pay all the
wheat is worth, so those who have it
for sale will make money by holding
their grain until they have seen him.
The office building on the lot near
the Glcnrock Hotel will soon be put
up and ready for occupancy and as
soon as the new firm is ready to buy
grain the News will give a market re
port for the benefit of its readers.
TO THE VOTERS
This is to thank each of vou for
the big vote I received in t'. . Demo

port is appreciated, and may I ask you
to continue the same until I fail to
show my appreciation by unfaithful
service.
I ran against two extra good men;
my voto was greater than the two. As
soon as the polls were closed at six
o'clock we joined hands for the suc
cessful man. To run a race with such
clean men is a rare privilege.
Your humble nominee has been up
against tho rocks nnd flowers of this
old world enough to lovo a square
deal and a helping band and I want
to so conduct the ofllce of probate
judge that friend and foo will say
"It is not in his mako-up to betray a
trust."

enforcement of natural and civil law
in one of the greatest nations of the

which shall lie enforced to the best
of my ability if I am elected.

Editor News,
Dear Sir:
I suppose news is scarce about this
time of year. Just thot 1 would let
you know what Wiseman and myself
aru doing this summer. Wiseman is
in Silver City attending the normal

gogy degree in August. I am going
to Denver University summer school
and will receive my Hachelor of Arts
degree in August. Wiseman has a
Hachelor of Pedagogy degree now and
I have a Hachctor of Science in Agri
culture.
I have been farming at my home,
and studying law. However, summer
school will be enough to do pretty
soon, it was cold and rainy the first
week 1 was home and I nearly froze.
However, it is wa'ming up now and I
can get up a sweat quite easily.
With Rest Wishes,
J. VERNE ELLIS
Tho foreging shows that Mr. Ellis
was enjoying good health and a. he
corresponded witli others in Tucum

YOUNG ROBINSON BOY
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
Young Robinson who is staying at
the home of hi sister, Mrs. V. S. Shif
lett northwest of town, was accidental
ly shot Saturday night while prepar
ing for a hunting trip.
He and another boy had cleaned the
guns preparatory for the trip when
tho other boy took down a revolver
to take witli them. Robinson told him
it was unnecessary to take it and when
he placed it back on the shelf it was
struck in some manner and the load
discharged, the ball passing through
Robinson's left arm and chest, lodging
in the linck. It is supposed to have
passed through the left lung. It look
ed liko a fatal shot and he was hurried
to the Physicians' Hospital where the
bullet va located and removed.
Hoth lite boys were so excited that
neither one knows who had hold of
the gun when it was discharged, but
from the appearance of the wound the
gun was some little distance from
Robinson when he was shot, but it was
purely accidental, and is only another 1
lesson to everybody to be careful when ,
handling n gun no matter whether it )
is loaded or not. i

Sunday for a game of base bull. The

they had a chance to win from tho lo

some ball playin' bunch and would
have bet their hats that she would take
borne tho bacon.
This was a sad mistake. If she over
did know how to play bull Sunday was
her off day as the Tucumcari boys
played rings around them and it was
too one-sided to be interesting to the
fans who braved tho hot sun. When
