AN EXCELLENT BUNCH J
OF AMATEURS
We have seen a great many amateur
minstrel performances, but none, that
came so near attaining professional
excellence as that given by the "Com
mercials" at the Temple theater Wed
nesday night.
The boys gave a splendid show, and
many remarked that all they needed
was a lew .weeks practice to maice
them able to go out on the road. They
bad not had any too much practice
or this performance, which made their
success all the more creditable. About
he only criticism to be made of then-
work is that some of them spoke in
too low a tone. ' ,
The house was crowded, upstairs and
down, and the audience was. very ap
preciative. Never did an Ocala crowd
go home in better humor. "
The "Palm Beach Club," "Pat An
derson, Linn Sanders, Alfred Green,
Leroy Bridges, Bryan ; Butler, Dick
Stroud and Kenneth McKay,, shone re
splendent in that sort of raiment. The
"black face" contingent, Sibbald Wil
son, Dr. Jack Halton, Rae Ferguson,
Usher Norwood, Austin Bennett and
Carol Blalock, was funny enough to
kill. Mr. Lester Lucas, professional,
splendid singer and apt comedian,
handled the little amateur bunch so
well that it is evident he will some day
have a show of his own. The pleasure
of the evening was greatly added to
by the skilled manipulation of the
piano keys by Carlton Ervin.
The fun started with "Alabama
Jubilee," by Usher Norwood, y: "Pat
Anderson, whose voice has had a local
reputation for some timeY followed
with "Hello, Hawaii, How Are You.'
Rae Ferguson. Alfred Green, Caro
Blalock, Sibbald Wilson, Linn Sanders,
Dr. Halton and finally Mr. Lucas out
warbled the mockingbirds.
Sibbald Wilson and Dr. Halton were
properly named the premieres to
look at them was to laugh, and to hear
them was to keep on laughing.
Everybody was expecting a scream
when W. Austin ; Bennett rendered
"Walking the Dog' but . Mr. Bennett
was out of voice and did not sing. He
kept his corner illuminated by a cheer
ful grin, however. "
One of the most interesting parts of
the performance was the chalk talk by
Rae Ferguson and Sibbald Wilson
which two boys have real -talent as
cartoonists. The sketches they drew
of Mexico, President Wilson, Mayor
Robertson, Teddy Roosevelt, B. Gold
man and .others were funny and faith
lui enougn to be easily recognized
Each was greeted with a hearty laugh.
and all us other distinguished men
drew a long breath of relief when the
feature was over.
The performance was closed : by
"The Sextette from Lucia," by the
"Blackville School of Music," which
alone was worth the price of the show.
Woodmen meet Friday evening.

Taylor Has Put Itself in Line With
... 1
the Most Progressive Coun
ties in Florida
Perry, July 27 By carrying a
bond issue for $600,000 for good roads
Tuesday Taylor county lined itself up
with the most progressive counties of
lorida and in cidentally insures the
building of the west loop of the Dixie
Iighway through northwest Florida
over the lines on which it was origin
ally laid out.
There will be twenty-four miles of
brick and eighteen miles of sand as
phalt, on the Dixie Highway through
Taylor county,' which work will be
done first and may be ready for ,use
this winter., In addition there will be
about ,50 miles of "sand "asphalt' roads
in other directions through the coun-
y mostly radiating, from this city as
a hub.
The vote was heavier than had been
predicted in spite of the heavy rains
vhich lasted xf or several hours.' Ten
precincts out of the twelve in the
county show a total of 1 580 for bonds
and .309 against. The two precincts
not yet heard from will poll about
sixty votes, which it is figured will
be about eually divided. Precinct No.
1, which polls about half the vote of
the county, gave - 376 for bonds
against 115 against them.'-
Tuesday's " election marks the close
of, a campaign for good roads in this
county that has lasted for two years.
The present board of county commis
sioners was . elected on "hard road"
tickets, but the tide of sentiment
seemed to be turning when four of
the present commissioners were nom
inated in June on an anti-bond issue.
The Taylor county good roads boost
ers were not to be discouraged, how
ever, and the vigorous educational
campaign conducted by the Taylor
County Good Roads association " had
its fruiting . Tuesday.

of the engineers. He said he thought
he engineers ought to be constantly
on the work of inspection, and failing
in this ought to be removed. He in
terprets the contract with the en-

THE RIGHTS
(Associated
Washington, July 27. President
Wilson and the state department have
practically ' completed the protest
against the British black list of cer
tain American firms, and it is said it
probably will be forwarded in a few

claim it will benefit the purely Amer
ican firms and also that the United

ularly during the civil war.

HAMPSHIRE HOGS
Breed that may be Counted . on to
Make Marion County Famous
v for Bacon
In the years to come Marion county
will be widely heralded as the county
"famous for its Hampshire hogs."
The bankers of the county, meeting
yesterday afternoon with R. W. Black-
ock, county demonstration -?ent, de
cided on the Hampshire for the boy's
pig club work, and it is proposed that
the farmers adopt the same hog in
irder that the breed might become un
iform throughout the county. A num
ber of leading farmers have already
said that they would adopt the breed
agreed on by the bankers, and it is ex
pected that others will follow in this
as rapidly as possible.
The hogs for the pig club boys will
be obtained through the National
Hampshire Association, and will be
bred gilts weighing about 250 pounds
each. The hogs will cost $40 each
delivered in Ocala. It was found that
the first class hogs wanted could not
be obtained for less. Mr. Blacklock
will at once get in touch with the
club boys and find out how many want
gilts. Farmers, who want to obtain
Hampshire boars or sow3 can order
them through Mr. Blacklock at the
same time that the boy's hogs are or
dered. -
The one breed idea is gaining rapid
ly in the county as the advantages of
it are pointed out, and it is believed
that the adoption of the one breed
is one of the most important steps
ever taken in the county.
The Hampshire is a black hog with
a white belt about its shoulders, and
is a beautiful animal, with splendid
records behind it.
