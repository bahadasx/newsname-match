Demonstration Planned For Tonight
Mayor Meals has been entrusted by the street car strikers to
present their side of the case to President Musser in an effort to
bring the strikers and the company together on the basis of the
statement issued by the Mayor yesterday to a Telegraph represen
tative.
John J. Thorpe, strike leader in the city, in a statement to-day
together with Hugh A. L. McLaughlin, president of the local
division of the carmen's union, declared that the men will not insist
on recognition of the Amalgamated Association and have changed
the preamble of their terms of agreement. ,
Mayor E. S. Meals was chosen by the strikers to present the
changed statement to President Musser, and the Mayor arranged
to do so late this afternoon.
President Frank B. Musser of the Railways Company, said that
until he received an official notice of the change in the strikers'
terms, he would be unable to make any statement, and that in the
meantime the strikers who apply for positions may return to work,
under the conditions set forth last night in an agreement with the
loyal employes.
This agreement grants a two-cent an hour increase in wages to
motormen and conductors, and provides for the betterment of work
ing conditions.
The men on strike declared they
have gone the limit in changing their
preamble, and will await the decision
of the company.
Thirty-three cars were sent out on
the lines of the company this morning
and service was resumed to Hummels
town and Oberlln for the first time
since the strike began almost two
weeks ago.
According to Sueprlntendent of
Transportation Felix M. Davis, efforts
are being made to maintain schedules
as much as possible, although there
are not quite enough cars out to give
the service maintained before the
strike.
John A. Moffatt, commissioner of
conciliation of the United States De
partment of Labor, arrived in this city
last evening at 7.30 o'clock, and to-day
he is endeavoring to bring about a
meeting between the Harrisburg Kail
ways Company and the strikers.
Mr. Davis' Statement
Twenty-five of the cars on the lines
this morning were operated, Mr.
Davis said, oy loyal employes, and
the remainder by strike-breakers.
Service was'resumed on all city and
suburban lines for the first time since
the beginning of the strike and no
disorder occurred at any place, ac
cording to city and county author

By Associated Press
Paris, July 27. Sir Edward Mor
, ris, premier of New Foundland, In an
I interview to-day with a representative
of the Havas News Agency, declared
that the Germans were beginning to
realize that the war is practically fin
ished. Premier Morris has Just re
turned from the section of the Somme
front where the New Foundland de
tachment is stationed. In his inter
view he said:
"The war is virtually finished and
the Germans are beginning to realize
it. The battle of Verdun, the greatest
battle in history, is a victory for
France. It is the first, of all her glor
ious exploits and gives a new impulse
to the whole nation.
"German prisoners with whom I
talked, officers wearing the iron cross,
told me that the Emperor and his
staff seem to fear that Germany has
lost the game. The collapse of Ger
many is only a question of time. When
that day arrives we must see that the
victory won by our arms is not lost by
diplomatic negotiations."
