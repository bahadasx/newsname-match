LONDON. July 2fi. (14:40 p.m.)
The allies are Mila to congratu
late themselves on another good day's
record with the rapture of impoi tiint
positions of Poziores, nn t lie western
front, nnd Krztngan in Armenia, while

The llritiHh .secretary for war, Pa
Vid Lloyd-Ueorge, In a published
statement tonight, shows the import
ance the Germans attached to the
retention of Pozieres by quoting from
a German divisional order issued in
Conlahiiaison on July 11, as follows:
"Furthermore, the conversion of
villages into strong points is of the
greatest importance. Such village
are Pozieres, Contalmaisoti and the
two Bezuntinc anil ixingueval."
Secretary Lloyd-Ucorge points out
that with the capturo of Pozieres, the
last of these villages has fallen irto
the allies' luinds. He further points
out that today's German claim of the
repulse of an attack on Trones wood
must lie a clerical error, as Trones
wood has been in British possession
since July 14.
Strongest Have Fallen.
The opinion of the military critics
In london is that no position so strong
as Dig British are now success! ully
attacking will bo found between I'o
zieres and Bapuutuc; otherwise, they
firguo, tlie Germans would not have
risked bringing troops And guns from
the Verdun sector to defend Pozieres,
and it is Inferred from Indications in
the official dispatches that the Brit
ish are already beginning to establish
themselves on hot It sides of the I O ld
rom Pozieres tu Papaume.
Ah on the western front the Ger
mans and the Austrian failed to
make a successful stand anywhere
uguinst the victorious Russian forces.
General Sakharoff's recent success
lias brought him within about li
miles of Brody, which guards the ap
proaches to Leuiherg and places von
Bothmcr's army in danger.
The unexpectedly swift full of Er
zingan leads to the supposition here
t hi. t the Turks must have removed the
guns from the defenses of this town
to u.ssist the armies in the field, not
anticipating1 such a rapid Russian ad
vance in such a difficult country.
The Italian front attracts little
public interest, but the Italians have
recently been making good progress
In the I'olomilcs region.
With the village of Poziores com
pletely and apparently securely In
their hands and havin? strengthened
their position hy the capture of two
strong trenches west of the village,

OLNKY, 111., July 26. An explana
tion of the cucumstanccs to which are
attributed the death of Miss Klizabeth
Radcllffe late Friday night was given
today by 11. G. Morris, stute's at
torney. Because of the girl's death, Roy
Hinterhter Is held without bail to
await action hy the November grand
jury.
The dearh of Miss Radcllff. It is
claimed by the state's atorney, was
due to a bungling attempt to perforin
an illegal operation. Air bubbles, it
is claimed, entered the circulatory
system of tho young girl and when
they reached the heart or brain death
must have resulted.
State's Attorney Morris today gavo
out a statement explaining the patho
logical feature of tho case. Stating
that the autopsy showed that- the girl
was in a delicate condition, the
posecutor added:
"There were no exterior marks of
violence. Three experienced surgeons
found all organs perfectly normal.
"In cutting Into the right ventricle
air escaped. The heart was perfectly
healthy. When the surgeons removed
the top of the skull they noticed
bubbles of air. All blood vessels of
tho brain showed air circulation. There
were no structural changes, but on a
test the brain floated in water. There
was no lesion of the lung.
"Later it was discovered that a man
threw avyiy an Instrument used in an
Illegal operation. It was found the
man had boasted of previously using
such instruments."
The prosecutor has letters said to
have been written by Hinterliter to the

for the open sea through the Virginia

Secrecy surrounds the plans of
Captain Koenlg. After securing his

he said in reply to questions asked

OKLAHOMA CITY. Okla., July 26.
That the prowsed literacy test
amendment to the constitution will be
defeated by t,n overy helming major
ity is the prediction made at the po
litical headquarters of all parties In
this city.
iHTent Democrats, tired of the reif,"n
of crooked politics in Oklahoma, are
making just as much of a fight
against tiic law as tho Republicans and
Socialists. From every section of the
state comes reports of Democratic
workers who have declared they will
bolt the organization rather than
stulttfy themselves by trying to put
the literacy amendment across.
The ballot is clearly and puno?ely
and corruptly made as a trap to de
ceive the uninformed voter.

If the amendment carries it will
tako from every man. white, Indian
or neii'ro, who cannot reaJ or write any
section of our state constitution, the
right to vote, unless he has been in
war. or is a descendant of someone
who has either been in war or mili
tary service.
''If this amendment is defeated."
said l'.d S. Vaught, president of the
Ok'uhnma city chamber ol commerce
and prominent Republican, today, "It
defeats the whole effect of all the
crrrcpt election laws passed by the
last session of the legislature. Can
there be any honest reason for such
a form of ballot? Its only purpose
must be to deceive or mislead the
votor."
If this amendment Is defeated the
registrar cai-not dlVranchise any
voter. If It Is adopted everyone will
be required to register all over ugain
in September, and in five days' time,
and the registrars will then have a
free rein to arbitrarily, nnd at their
will refuse to register any voter they
decide to disqualify under this new
constitutional amendment.
Men at 1IU.
Tho Republican organization has
mede arrangements to have men at
every poll in the state next Tuesday,
well supplied with lead pencils. They
will instruct voters how to vote
against the I'mendment and furnish
them wlih pencils to mark out the
words "For the Amendment."
State Republican Chuiruinn Geis
sler today gave out the following
i tatemetit;
"In order to check the independent
tcter, and l.i keep the ate from go
ing Republican, the stile administra
tion, with the apparent sanction of
Wooc'row Wilson, and other national
lenders, deviled a most audacious
scheme of disfranchisement of recal
citrant voters.
ReTnt Special Sessloa.
'To provide for this system of dis
franchisement, the legislature w:u
called i" special session, in Januarv,
1 J 1 8. The universal law was enacted,
which provided that one Democratic
state official appoint a countv regis

remove at will: ami that the county
registrar shall apiolnt a registrar for
every precinct, whom ho may rerrovo
at will. A more autocratic form of
election machinery certainly could not
be devised.

"Then it was provided that every
voter must get a certificate of regis

provided, however, that any voter
might he registered during tUe fol

the precinct registrar that he wus dur

the county or prevented from regis
tering by sickness or unavoidable mis
fortune. The registrar was not le
quired to be at a certain place during
the registration period. Hu was not
even required to be a resident of bis
product Ample latltudo was given
to that official to look up and itgl.-iter
those who were politically congenial
and to evade and even to infuse to
register political opponents. In this
wise quite a number of Oklahoma it
izens were disfranchised, but the ad
ministration cnlcu'iitcd that the num

sufficiently large to keep th? state
from going Republican, nnd m; pro

vote of tho people, on August first a
constitutional amendment known as

and three torpedo boat destroyeis,
under orders from Washington to do

Officials under tho direction of both

According to witnesses the accident
was tile result of carelessness on the
part of the crew on the Frisco switch
ing engine. The engine had just
drawn into tho siding which opened
north and. had left the switch open.
Tho Midland Valley passenger Is
scheduled to arrive ill Tulsa at 3:30
o'clock, but yesterday was 2!i min
utes late. Kvidentiy surmising that
the passenger had gone, the crew of
the switch engine possibly thought It
useless to close tho switch, since they
were to pull out in a short time,
Tho engine hacked about eighty
yards from the mouth of the siding,
where it coupled to a long train of
empty oil cars. Tho entire crew of
the train then congregated at the side
of the roadbed, about two cars in the
rear of the engine, and proceeded to
split a juicy watermelon, according to
two men who saw the entire accident.
I'RKM'ngcr Comes on.
In a few seconds the Midland Val
ley passenger came from the soujh
at a rate of about twenty miles per
hour. Fussing tho crossing of the
Sand Springs railway, which Is about
flfiy feet north of the head of the
siding, the engine whistled twice, but
did not slow up perceptibly.
When about fifty feet Trorn the
switch, the engineer, according to his
version, saw that he was set for the
siding instead of the main line and
threw his entire force of brakes. The
wheels of the engine were reveied
nnd locked, but the heavy train slid
tho entire distance Into tho switch
engine.
It Is estimated that the train was
traveling at a rate of eight miles per
hour at the time of the collision.
The heavy Frisco engine, backed by
a long train of oil cars, stood its
ground well, suffering only a smashed
front end. The lighter Midland Val
ley locomotive rebounded and Its
tender was telescoped into t lie mail
car with who h It connected. The
tender forced its way almost on top of
the moil car, seeming to climb it. The
mail car was demolished. No other
cars were derailed.
Passengers Thrown About.
The shock threw every passenger
into far corners of the coaches. Backs
of seats were broken by bodies crash
ing against them. Mad with excite
ment the passengers fought to gain
exit. Only the fact that a majority of
the travelers were men saved further
accidents during the rush for the
doorways.

clan, was notified Immediately and
arrived within a few moments taking
charge of the relief work. Almost be

It would be a physical impossibility to

The work is slow, as the lists do not
come in regularly nor rapidly. It was
said several days ago that registrars
In some counties said they would no.
send in the lists. Campbell Russell,
In securing mandamus compelling the
secretary of state to send the pamph

registrars refused to send in the lirs
he would seek mandamus proceedings
compelling them to do so. There
no record of nny such proceeding in
any ecunty as yet. There .ire some
twenty counties, however, where Cie
lists have not reached the secretary
