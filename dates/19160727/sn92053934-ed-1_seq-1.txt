Labor Is Warned Against;
Machinations of Apostles S
of Protest.
Rcr".!!. July 2S, (via Tendon. luly 27.
The manifesto t the working classes,
issued by the s.K'ialit executive com
mittee an i '.he iu-neial coti:niion of
labor unions, appealing agamst the
general strike ot the I. Ku. 'M o
cialists are trying' to organize, says in
part :
"T!:e prolonged war weighs heavily
on a!! nv.io:;s and entail 3 great sacri
fices. It severely tesxs the endurance
of those at home and at the front and
it is natural thnt ill feeling and dio
conter.t should develop.
Situation Abused.
"This situation is unfortunately be
ing abused by irresponsible individuals
who wish to mislead labor into resort
ing to measures which are not in the
slightest degree? adapted to relieve the
burden but rather to increase it. An
attempt is being made through anony
mous leaflets to sow hatred and dis
trust against the deputies chosen by
the wt.-rknien tl.emsel ves. The charge
launched against these men who for
years have stood at the head of the
organization of German labor classes is
that they are sacrificing socialist prin
ciples, have disregarded decisions of
German socialist party conventions and
internaiiona. congress, and have perpe
trated party treason, etc.
Should IMsregaxd Insinuations.
"Such insinuations and abuse could
be disregarded if labor simultaneously
was not instigated to ill advised pro
ceedings and an unscrupulous propa
gandura conducted for strikes and
mass actions.
"We consider it our duty to warn
labor against the machinations of
apostles of protest and a general strike '
working in darkness and anonymity.
"Extraordinary difficulties are pres
ent in the distribution of the food sup
plies. We have not failed to combat
abuses existing in this field with every
means at our disposal. We have strug
gled for the efficiency of measures for
the relief of the unemployed and for
the aid of the wives and widows of
soldiers and the wounded.
Aid Coming- of Peace,
"Our most important ta.sk is to aid
in the speedy coming of peace. The
con petei.i organization in the lalor
movement is conscious of this great
ciutv Ml is working untiringly to ful
fil it."

War Is Over
Opinion of
Sir Edwai'd
Paris, July 17. Sir Edward Morrir,
premier of .New Foundland. Inter
viewed today by the Havas News
aponry, declared the Germans were be
ginning to realize that the war is prac
tically finished. Premier Morris has
just returned from the Somme front
whore the New Foundland detachment
is stationed.
-The war is virtually finished and
the Germans are beginning to realize
it." he said. "The battle of Verdun is
a victory for France. It is the finest
of all glorious exploits and lives a
now impulse to the whole nation.
"German, prisoners with whom I
talked, officers wearing the iron cross,
told me that C'e emperor aud his stnT
seem to fear that Germany has lost the
frame. The collapse of Germany is on
iy a question of time. When that d::y
arrives we must see to it that the vic
tory won by our arms is not lost by
diplomatic negotiations."
WANT TO WSO
HinfHOV firmer
Washington, July 27. Prospects of
an early agreement between the Amer
ican and Mexican governments to sub
mit the border disagreements to a
joint commission were described as.
brighter today, after Acting Secretary
Polk again conferred with Eiiseo Arre
dondo, General Carranza's ambassa
dor. The conferees found themselves
closer to agreement on the several
points.
The Washington government wants
to widen the scope of the commission
investigation beyond General Carran
za's suggestion that it discuss with
drawal of American troops, measures
to protect American border interests
from bandits, and the origin of raids.
It was assumed that Mr. Arredondo
was able to assure Mr. Polk today that
his government was willing that the
commissioners should investigate eco
nomic and financial matters between
the two countries with the Utt oi
tinditig means to aid Mf-Xtcrv?rn.rTti-reiBii

Washington. July 27. Sir Cecil
Spring-Bice, the British ambassador,
informed Acting Secretary Polk today
that he had received a message from
the admiral commanding the British
squadron in the Atlantic, denying that
a British warship had entered Chesa
peake bay, as reported by the com
mander of the battleship Louisiana.
The ambassador said the British
ships had strict orders not to enter th
three-mile limit of American territor
ial waters and the admiral had re
ported that their instructions had not
been violated at any time.
Mr. Polk was told that the British,
admiral was indignant over the report
that one of his cruisers had made art
incursion into Chesapeake bay under
cover of darkness early yesterday
morning. The statement of the ambassador
will be eccepted by the state depart
ment but the commander of the Louis
iana is being pressed by the navy for
further details of his report that a

a desire for more. One point it Is un

why the cruiser was not seen leaving
