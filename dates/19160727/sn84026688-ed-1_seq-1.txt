FOREST NOTES.
On some of the National Forests of;
the Northwest the snow lay on the
ground longer this spring than for
many years. In consequence stock
men have been considerably delayed
in getting their herds on the ranges.
All of the 2S counties of Utah con
tain portions of National Forests and
consequently all share in the 25 per
cent of the National Forest receipts
which is paid over to the road and
school funds. This is true of no
other State.
One hundred thirty thousand maps
of the National Forests will he dis- .
trihuted to tourists this summer, j
These maps show the liest campsites, j
good hunting and fishing grounds,
roads, trails, and telephone lines,
and give directions how to reach
points of interest.

LOOK MORE TO THE FUTURE
Mother’s Vision Sometimes Too Urn
' Ited, Is the Opinion of Writer
In Leading Magazine.
Why do so many mothers fall? Is
It not because they lack Imagination?
Because they cannot see tho effect of
their training on their children’s later
life? They have fixed rules to fit pres
ent circumstances. Their discipline Is
for today; none of It has reference to
tho future. If mothers had a little
more vision, they would not try to
govern their children to suit parental
convenience, but they would let the
youngsters bo themselves. A mother
should be able to see the man In the
child, as the gardener sees the bush
with Its blossoms In the tiny sprout;
and she should care for her children
ns ho cares for hla plants—not trying
to twist them Into unnatural shapes
but providing the proper conditions
for them to develop according to their
nature.
Help your child to develop Judg
ment rather than compel him to obey
arbitrary rules. The arbitrary for
mulas of conduct you manufacture for
him today may not help him In the
least In his later relationships. When
your son grows to maturity he will
not he surrounded with the same con
ditions that made tip the environment
of hla childhood. Ho will perhaps go
to new places and come In contact
with new people. Even If he docs not
loavo hla native town, he will have to
face new conditions; for his town will
change with the times. Ills city will
not harbor tho same Ideas that pre
vailed In bis youth. Mon will think
differently, and he will have to keep
lip with the procession. Are you pre
paring film to meet the tests of life
that will come to him when he Is a
man? Are you preparing your daugh
ter to be a better mother than you
are?—Mother’s Magazine.
ORIGIM OF CURFEW BELL
Merely Served as Warning to Cover
Fire in the Time of William
the Conqueror.
So many towns ring tho curfew hell
to warn the children that 9 o’clock
p. ra. must find them safe In the homo
nest, It is interesting to know that tha
curfew bell originated In the time of
William tho Conqueror, says a writer
In tho People's Homo Journal. A "cur
few” was a fire cover of metal, shaped
liko a hood, with a handle by which it
was lifted. It had an opening on one
side, and was about ten Inches in
height. Because fires In early days
were made on large, open hearths, the
smoke escaping through a hole in tho
roof, fire risk was great. It was or
dered that every householder before
retiring must cover his lire with a
“couvre-feu," meaning “cover the fire.’’
Ho scraped the embers together at the
back of the hearth, putting tho cover
over them, tho open part close against
the chimney.
A bell was rung In the market place,
at an early hour every night, ns a sig
nal that people must extinguish their
fires and go to bed. The term “cur
few" was associated with the ringing
of the bell. But in William the Con
queror's time a curfew was nothing
more poetical than a plain metal fire
extinguisher.
Far Better.
In a neat English village lived a to
bacconist named Farr. Now, this to
bacconist had a rival. Both want
ed the trade of the town. Farr, be
ing a wit, devised a sign and hung It
outside his shop:
"Best tobacco by Farr."
The townsfolk, relishing a pun,
flocked to IPs shop and his trade In
creased at the expense of his rival's
business.
Now, his rival brooded and medi
tated, consulted many books of an
cient lore, a Roget’s Thesaurus, and
a rhyming dictionary. One day his
face was seen to wreathe Itself In
smiles. Gossip hovered expectant
about his shop. The anticipations of
tho townsfolk were not disappointed.
For that very day ho hung out a sign
which read:
"Far belter tobacco than the best by
Farr."
Immersed In Self.
We are all too immefsed In self—
that Is where the trouble lies, if wa
could only got out of ourselves enough
to forget personal feelings in our re
lations with outsiders they would not
have to suffer for no fault of their
own. The stenographer and bookkeep
er would not have to put up with their
employer’s Irascibility, the maid would
not have to endure her mistress’ harsh
faultfinding, tho poor dramatist’s play
would not have to fail because of tha
critic's indigestion, and the singer
would not be hopelessly set back be
cause of the reviewer’s grippe. All this,
of course, will only come when wa
have learned a little about self-con*
trol and self-forgetfulness.
Valuable Wood.
The tree most valuable In the Gui
ana forests Is that known as green
heart, or siperia. Greenheart Is among
Lloyds' list of eight first-class woods
and is one of the strongest woods in
use. It is employed largely In en
gineering and construction work, har
bor works, railway trestles and
bridges. The 50 large pairs of lock
gates in the Manchester ship canal are
all built of greenheart from Demerara.
Engineers have said it is impossible to
estimate the durability of greenheart,
particularly in the construction of
docks, their lasting quality being 11m
i lied only by the iron bolts and other
fastenings used.

Two Loaves of Bread a Day Is Ra
tion of Austrian in Journey From
Buffalo to New York—Doesn’t
Like Canada.
New York.— A bedraggled, oil
smeared, ruddy little man with some
thing akin to fear in his big, brown
eyes, stepped softly into the office of
Arthur Concurs, superintendent of the
Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant
Aid Sooiety, recently.
‘Tch bin bier," he announced calm
ly, as though that were the most im
portant thing in the world. And it
was, to him, for twenty-three-yeai-010
Eugcn Spitz, Austrian reservist anu
expert upholsterer, bud walked all the
way from Buffalo to New York with
deadly fear of the Canadian army
spurring him on.
Twenty-four days hud Eugen been
on the road, and his expenditures foi
food during that time had been just
tlie three dollars, all that he had on
starting. For eight mouths before he
began his 4SU-mile walk he had been
a prisoner in a Toronto detention
camp, and his hike was Inspired by
the overwhelming desire to put just
ns much territory as possible between
himself and Canada.
Within the Enemy’s Lines.
Spitz came to the United States
from Bninn, which is near the Ger
man border of Austria, on June 18
1914. He went to Buffalo to work in
a dye factory a tew months later.
The most peculiar part of his story
1s that last fall a German offered him
a good Job of indefinite nature, anc
took him to Toronto without letting
him know they were entering Can
ad a.
“As soon as we got off the train,’
Spitz explained in broken English
“that man disappeared. The police
man came, and they took me on a trail
to a big stone house, where were t\vi
or three hundred Germans and Aus
trians.
“There I lived in a room with sixty
others for six mouths. We slept oi
tlie floor, with blankets for cover, anc
we had soup and bread to eat. but tlu
only work we had to do was clean up
tho camp. But all the time 1 wat
afraid, and then three of our nnmbei
tunneled under the outside wall and
tried to escape.
One man got away, but the soldien
killed one of the others and captureo
the third.
“All the time I kept telling tlu
guards that I was a Roumanian, anc
at last they believed me. So finally
they told me 1 could go, I walked to
the railroad, whore a lot of Italians
were working, and 1 told the conduc
tor 1 was an Italian. He let mt- ride
on tho train to Buffalo.’’
“Why didn’t you get a Job in Huffa
10. then, instead of coming hero?" lu
was asked.
“Too Near Canada."
“Buffalo —no, no!” Spitz exclaimed
excitedly, bis face hushing. “Too neui
Canada.
"1 sell my suit for $3 and I put or
my overalls. Then 1 start to walk U
New York along tho railroad tracks
Sometimes I slept in freight car* and
sometimes In watchmen’s houses, but
all tho time I walked and walk' d. 1
uto two loaves of bread every day, be.
cause 1 had money enough to buy that
and at Syracuse a poor Jew took mt
to his house, made me stay all nlghi
ami gave me food.
“1 got tired, but 1 walked—be. aust
Canada was behind. Now 1 am here
I am glad.”
Mr. Conoors examined tho little
man’s papers and found they bore out
his story. Then he gave the refugee
some fresh clothes and a bed. and
within a few hours Spitz was ready tc
look for a job.

rise of two feet over the next night
brought the water still nearer the sur

FLOWERS TELL OWN STORY
Japanese Art Enables One Readily tf
Understand the Significance of
Their Arrangement.
In the Flowery Kingdom they work
wonders with their flowers. They
make calendars of them. They tell
stories with them. They symbolize
aeroplanes, dainty women, and every
thing else by means of floral units,
which we In America would uso merely
for a bouquet. The folklore and
mythology of Japan are often vividly
expressed In flower arrangement.
In arranging flowers the Japanese
try to place them In the same posi
tion that they would naturally take.
An American would put a bunch of
cherry blossoms Into a vase, upright;
a Japanese would place the branch in
a horizontal position, such as they
occupy in growing.
The Japanese idea of flower ar
rangement is that one perfect indi
vidual flower, together with leaves and
stem, is more beautiful than masses
of them bunched together.
By using special containers and
supports, the Japanese mako flowers
last twice as long as we do. In ar
ranging flowers in a receptacle they
trim the leaves from tire stalks be
low" the water, and for a short dis
tance above. This gives the flower
the appearance of growing. By tak
ing a piece of bamboo, the Japanese

The Japanese do not like the rose
and the lily. Flowers that have
thorns are cruel and those whose pet
als drop off symbolize Inconstancy.
The cherry, wistaria, magnolia, azalea,
peony, camellia, peach, plum, maple,
pine, chrysanthemum, iris, lotus and
morning glory find more popular favor.
LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT
Comparatively Trivial Trouble in Phil
adelphia Building Made Structure
Temporarily Worthless.
Any lugh-school girl graduate can
write a pretty essay on “The Little
Things That Count."
For example, a cinder In the eye is
more formidable than Mount Shasta,
3000 miles away. One fly spoils a bar
rel of ointment, and so on indefinitely.
Had the president of the United
States resigned at 11:45 o'clock on a
recent day scores of persons would
have been less affected than they were
when tiro elevator men in a skyscraper
at Broad and Chestnut quit work.
We do have a vice president, but we
have no wings to carry us to our eight
eenth floor oftices. Consternation is
a feeble word and far 100 anemic to
describe the feelings of that throng of
men and women who swiftly clogged
the corridors of that huge building.
Can you imagine a more futile tiling
than 20 floors of masonry and steel
without an elevator? You never can
imagine how many people shoot up and
down in these iron-grilled cages in ten
minutes, until the cages cease to fly
like shuttles on a weaver's loom.
Just a few cents' worth of human en
ergy in the arm of a man. or rather
the lack of it, puts |3,000,000 worth of
building on the scrap heap!— Phil

"Ye” Is Pronounced "Thuh.”
The “y” in “ye'’ is simply a substi
tute for the Anglo-Saxon “thorn let
ter," so called, which we have no way
of getting into this column. That
Anglo-Saxon letter, like the corre
sponding Icelandic character, stood
for “th.” The Encyclopedia Britan
nica says:
"The English letter ‘thorn’ sur
vived and continued in uso down to
the fifteenth century, when it was
transformed to y.”
As for the pronunciation of "ye,"
meaning "the,” it is, of course tas near
as we can put it into printer's ink)
"thuh" today, as was in Chaucer's
time and long before. Nobody who
speaks English ever pronounces "the"
as it it spelled "thee,” but gives it
the same sound as the “e" has In the
corresponding French word. Just as
the French pronounce "lo ]our" "lull
zhour,” so is "the day" pronounced
"thuh day." . . . The class is now
dismissed. —Manitoba Free Fress.
Saliva and the Emotions.
The influence of fear upon the flow
of saliva has long been known. The
dry mouth of the nervous person
called upon to speak in public is an
example. In India the effect of fear
in stopping the flow of saliva was at
one time used in finding the guilty per
son when several were suspected
of committing a crime. All who
were suspected had to chew the
consecrated rice and after a giv
en time spit it out upon a leaf of
the sacred fig tree. If anyone put
forth the rice in a dry state, that was
taken as proof that fear of being dis
covered had stopped his saliva from
flowing. He was regarded as guilty
of the crime.—Walter B. Cannon, M.

An Effective Mask.
“Such a lot of things happened this
afternoon, dear," said Mrs, Young
bride to her husband. "I complained
to Norah about the stove not being
blackened and she put on her things
and left. Then 1 decided to black the
stove myself, and right in the midst
of it who should call but Mrs. De-
Stylo.”
“What In the world did you do?’
“I Just put some more blackening
on my face, went to the door and told
her I wasn't In. And off she went
saying she wmuld call again.”—Boston
Transcript.
