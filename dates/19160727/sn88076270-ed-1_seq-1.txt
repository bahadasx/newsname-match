THOUSANDS III PANIC
AS BOMB IS HURLED
SIX KILLED, 40 HURT IN SAN
FRANCISCO PREPAREDNESS
PARADE
Explosion Amid Crowd Packed Along
Route Follows Threats Through
Mail
A bomb, exploded presumably by
anarchists in protest against
Francisco's bis: preparedness parade
of July 22, killed at least six persons
at Stewart and Market streets and
injuring 40 seriously, besides inflict
ing lesser injuries upon scores of oth-
C1Five
of the known injured will die,
the police said.
The capacity of downtown hospitals
was taxed to care for victims, but the
parade went on.
Frank Joseph Finch, a sailor, 46
years old, was arrested in connection
with the outrage. Within a few feet
of the bodies of the victims he made a
stump speech lauding anarchy and
saving, "This is nothing."
The bomb ,one of the deadliest in
fernal machines ever put together,
was left in a suitcase at the corner,
and exploded just as the First Cali
fornia regiment was
passing,
the line
of the parade getting into full swing.
The bomb consisted of a suitcase
packed with explosives and crammed
with nails, cartridges, slugs and oth
er missiles, making it more deadly
than the shrapnel of European battle
fields. Pieces hurled a block felled
their victims.
Hundreds of persons were gathered
at the corner beside the serried ranks
of the marchers, and the missiles
plowed through them. The building
against which the suitcase had been
left was wrecked, and stores across
the street partly- demolished.
Persons cut. half blinded, the blood
streaming from their faces and bodies,
ran madly through the crowd, and
others, panicstricken, stumbled over
the bodies of the dead and injured,
piling up in heats on the street.
Buildings for blocks around rocked.
A traffic officer was thrown from his
liors6i
Veterans of the Grand Army of the
Republic, preparing to march, escap
ed unscathed, and moved sturdily
ahead.
Warning Given Press
Warning that a bomb would be
hurled had been received yesterday
by newspapers and others. The close
watch for any move of this kind was
foiled in part by the fact that the
bomb was left in. the suitcase instead
of being thrown.
The explosion came as the_ tragic
climax to the greatest patriotic dem
onstration in the history of the Pacific
coast.
Nearly 50,000 persons represent
ing this city, Oakland and all the
cities on both sides of the bay were
marching up Market street in orderly
procession as a living expression of
the marchers in favor of the move
ment for national preparedness.
Half an hour after the head of the
parade had passed Stewart and Mar
ket streets, marching from the Fer
ry building, a deafening explosion
shattered the windows for several
blocks around and threw the spec-,
tators and marchers into a panic.
The bomb had gone off in the thick
est part of the Market street crowd.
Scores of persons were knocked down.
Persons standing on the sidewalk
were-heaped in a screaming, yelling
mass.
The foot of one child was torn com
pletely off and a marcher carrying a
big American flag, had the standard
blown from his hands and a piece of
it driven through his leg.
The wildest confusion prevailed. Po
licemen patrolling in the vicinity of
the explosion turned in a hurry call
for ambulances reinforcements broke
through the frantic crowd and flung
a cordon about the place.
Police Reserves Called Out
With the subsidence of the panic,
marchers and spectators surged back
as rescuers. Bodies of men, of women,
of children lay scattered about the
street. The entire police resources of
the district were immediately drawn
out.
The harbor emergency hospital am
bulance was standing almost across
the street from where the explosion
occurred. It had been called to carryc
a G. A. R. veteran, the flag bearer,
who had fainted while standing in
line and was then in an unconscious
condition at the oil station of the
Shell Oil company.
Hole Torn in Sidewalk
In Stewart street were lined up the
G. A. R. and the Daughters of the
American Revolution, waiting for
their place in the parade.
The explosion tore a hole through
the cement sidewalk and out of this
hole were picked pieces of a leather
suitcase, glass, brass nosed bullets,
iron scrap and pieces of a six-inch gas I
pipe. The bomb, the police believe,
was incased in this piece of gas pipe.
The windows of many buildings were
shattered.
Traffic Officer F. D. Goddy was sit
ting on his horse near the explosion
with a woman standing at his side. I
Goddy was knocked off the horse and
the woman hurled against the animal,
Throng Hurled to Street
Persons 75 feet distant were knock
ed down and injured. The street look
ed as though filled with dead a mo
ment after the explosion, so many
people had been knocked down.

NATURAL GAS FOUND NEAR
CROSBY
Crosby, N. D., July 25.—That there
is natural gas lying under the Crosby
country was demonstrated on the
farm worked by Harvey Hoover, five
miles north of Crosby. A flow of wa
ter containing natural gas was secur
ed there. The water flows somewhat
intermittantly and bubbles like car
bonated water. When a cupful of
water is taken from the well and a
lighted match held over it a blue
flame burns over the water for sev
eral seconds.
niUIES HUH DEN
MARX FOR ISLMDS
DANISH PARLIAMENT EXPECT
ED TO AGREE TO SALE TO
THE UNITED STATES
Treaty Drawn up and Ready For
Ratification, Washington
Reports
Washington, July 25.—Official an
nouncement was made at the white
house today that negotiations prac
tically had been completed for th'
purchase of the Danish West Indies
by the United States from Denmark
for $25,000,000.
The treaty closing the transaction
will probably be signed today, and
sent immediately to the senate.
Immediate Possession
While details of the treatv were not
given out, it is understood the United
States would come into complete pos
session of the islands.
Word has been received from Den
mark that the treaty is practically
certain of being ratified by the Dan
ish parliament.
Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations committee saw presi
dent Wilson today but said afterward
he had not discussed the purchase of
the Danish West Indies and knew
nothing of the question.
It is understood the government
hopes the treaty will be ratified by
the present session of congress.
The three islands of the Danish
West Indies—St. Croix, St. Thomas
and St. John—lie due east of Porto
Rico and their value to the United
States is from a strategic military
point of view.
The harbors of St. Thomas and St.
Croix are of first importance to the
American navy and St.. Thomas itself
lies in the lane of shipping from
Europe to the Panama canal. Im
portant German, French and English
mail companies have coaling stations
there.
Project Old One
Acquisition of the islands by the
United States has been the subject of
unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations
since the civil war.
If Denmark decides to part with is
lands there will remain to her only
two colonial possessions—Greenland
and Iceland. Denmark's huge expense
since the beginning of the war is said
to be responsible for willingness to
sell.

KNEE-DEEP IN JUNE

(Knee-Deep In June is one of the longest as well as one of the popular
poems of the well beloved Hoosier Bard whose death occurred July 22, 1916.)
Tell you what I like the best—
'Long about knee-deep in June,

And not work at nothin' else!

Sportin' round the orchard jes'

But flat on yer back, I guess,
In the shade's where glory in!
That's jes' what I'd like to do

Hughes May Speak at
Fargo Enroute West
Charles Evans Hughes, Republican
candidate for the presidency of the
United States, may speak in Fargo
on Thursday, August 10.
Speaking in Minneapolis and St.
Paul on August 8 and 9, the presi
dential candidate will depart from
the twin cities for the Pacific coast,
passing through North Dakota, and
it is now regarded as likely that his
North Dakota, address will be made
in Fargo.
If Justice Hughes visit Fargo on
his westward journey, the occasion of
his coming will be made the time ir••
a tremendous gathering of Republi
cans of the state, and Fargo no doubt
would be called upon to take care of
one of the biggest crowds ever gath
ered here.
Justice Hughes' itinerary for the
trip through the northern states,
to the Pacific coast, is now being for
mulated, and definite announcement
of a Fargo date will be made shortly.
Intimation that a Fargo date
would be forthcoming was made to
Frank B. Kellogg of St. Paul, in a
long distance telephone conference
with Chairman W. R. Willcox of New
York, of the national committee.

SEHATElEDGES" ON
COMMITTEE THAT BOOSTED FOR
PREPAREDNESS AGAINST MEX
ICO ABOUT-FACES
(James Gray in Minneapolis Journal)
Washington, D. C.—Convinced that
war with Mexico is not imminent the
senate today knocked $35,000,000 off
the items put in the measure to make
a general invasion of the southern re
public possible.
All of the reductions were made
upon recommendation of the military
affairs committee that a few weeks
ago was boosting them at the rate of
several million, dollars a day because
of anticipated hostilities.
Other reductions to be recommend
ed* will doubtless decrease the total
appropriations carried in the measure
by nearly $40,000,000. As originally
reported to the senate by the com
mittee, the bill totaled $330,000,000,
by far the largest arjny bill in the
history of the nation.
Troops to Do Patrol Duty
Senator George E. Chamberlain,
chairman of the military affairs com
mittee, told the senate it would be
possible to cut many millions of dol
lars out of the appropriations because
conditions in Mexicb were no longer
considered threatening by the admin
istration.
"I am frank to say." Senator Cham
berlain explained, "tha»t when this
bill was made up we inserted some
items in view of the existing situa
tion in Mexico, which might now be
cut out."
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts,
Penrose of Pennsylvania, and Brady
of Idaho pitched in with demands that
the administration inform the senate
as to the details of the guard's mo
biliaztion—as to how many men were
in camps along the border, how many
in state camps, and how many had
not been called out.
Military Secret, Says Senator
Senator Chamberlain said he had
the information, but that he was not
privileged to submit it to the senate
because it was a military secret. Sen
ator Lodge thereupon said he would
furnish it.
Producing a copy of the same com
pilation of figures published in The
Minneapolis Journal Wednesday, Sen
ator Lodge -said:
100,008 in Camp at Border
"Here is a very careful table made
up from the reports of the different
states where the militia is. It appears
that there is 100,008 in the mobiliza
tion camps on the border, 59,204 in
mobilization camps at home, and 14,
323 not called out. This table shows
what I wanted to know. I put it in
as a contribution to the information
already furnished in order to have it
printed as a part of my remarks.''
"What I wanted to get at," said
(Continued on page 8)

fearless,
the spirit of "Kid" Lampman was
born of the West and typical of it's
early traditions. During recent years
he suffered much from the malady
that finally overcame him but his na
tural habit of cheerfulness never de
serted him.
Linden Lorenzo Lampman was born
at Cleveland, Minn., in 1866. In 1888
he married Martha Perkins. In 1885
he came to Miles City, Mont., and in
1880 to this county later establishing
a sheep ranch near Grennell.

IN
RILEY, »0« POET
AT HIS HOI
AUTHOR OF "AN OLD SWEET
HEART OF MINE" SUCCOMBS
AT HIS HOME
Won Fame and Fortune By His Dia
lect Poems of Home and
Childhood
Indianapolis, July 22.—James Whit
comb Riley, famous children's poet,
died at his home here tonight follow
ing a stroke of paralysis. Death oc
curred shortly after 11 p. m.
James Whitcomb Riley, born of the
middle west, sang the joys, sorrows,
fancies and humors of its folk, largo^
ly in its own dialect. The world was
so touched by his inspiration and the.
realism of his hopnely symbols that
he was one of the few that, devoting
their lives to poetry, gained a fortune-
Mr. Riley was peculiarly sensitive
as to the advance of age and evaded
inquiries as to the date of his birth,
but the most accurate information
available indicates that he was bom
in 1848.
"Should you ask his age," one of"
his friends said, "he would answer,
"This side of 40,' and leave you to
guess which side.''
The poet was the son of Reuben A.
Riley, a lawyer and political speaker
of Greenfield, Ind. The boy could not
be brought to the dull routine of
school days, but was wise in the lore
of streams and fields. His mother,
who was Elizabeth Marine before her
marriage, was a writer of verse and'
Riley later in life attributed some of
his impracticability to her.
Was a Sign Painter
Instead of preparing for the prat
tice of law, as his father wished, th
son turned itinerant sign painted. Fo
11 years he roved through the Ohi
valley, painting signs on fences. He
had the trick of the brush and pencil'
and drew sketches illustrating the
virtues of merchandise. He was nat
urally musical and shone as a fiddler
in the villages at which his party
stopped at night. He played for danceW
and at concerts in country hotels.
He led this cheerful, free and easy
life late in the '70s, then he took em
ployment as a reporter on a news
paper at Anderson, Ind. In 1877, for
the purpose, as he said, of proving
that he could write poetry or value,
he perpetrated the Poe hoax which
for years was literary sensation. He
wrote a poem in the style of Edgar
Allen Poe,# to which he gave the'
characteristic title of "Leonanie," and
it was offered to the public as hither
to unpublished product of the geniu&
of Poe. One of the stanzas was:
"Leonanie—angels named her,
And they took the light
Of the laughing stars ana framed her
In a smile of white.
And they made her hair of gloomy
Midnight and her eyes of bloomy
Moonshine and they brought her
to me
In the solemn night."
In some quarters the poem was ac
cepted as genuine in others it was.
denounced as a fraud. After the con
troversy had waged for months Rilex
confessed.
Dialect Verse Popular
In the early '80s he began writing'
verses in "Hoosier" dialect for the
old Indianapolis Journal. He sent
some of his poems to Henry Wads
worth Longfellow and they received
his praise. A volume was published
and "the Hoosier poet" began to win
a public. He was an excellent reader
of his own dialect verses and for the
following 15 years or until 1898, he
made tours of the country, appearing
in public with great success both
alone and in association with the hu
morist, Bill Nye, who was his inti
mate friend.
Publication of books of poems year
after year brought Riley a fortum
and wide recognition of his literarj
genius and not only in the genrt
form. Many of his poems are of im
aginative fantasy of gently philoso
phic vein.
Honored by Colleges
In 1902 he received the degree of
master of arts from Yale university
and in 1904 the University of Pennsyl
vania conferred upon him the degree
of doctor of letters. Indiana univer
sity conferred the honorary degree of
LL.D. on him in 1907.
In July 1911, the poet presented to
the city of Indianapolis property
valued at $75,000 for a site for a pub
lic library and school administration
building.
Mr. Riley never married but he was
a lover of children, whose spirit he
divined so intimately, and of family
life. Many of the last years of his
life he spent quietly at his home in
secluded section of Indianapolis.
English Plot Is
Charged By Kaiser
London, July 25.—A dispatch from?
Berne, (via Pontarlier), France,
given out today by the wireless press
says: "Another speech by Emperor
William during his recent visit to thi
Somme front is being discussed ir
Berlin." The emperor said in part
"Comrades, Your special privilege
is to fight against the English, the na
tion which has sworn to destroy Ger
many. The English built up during
the years before the war a combina
tion of countries which at a given
signal fell upon us, the most peaceful
and most peace desiring people in the
world. The English lea us to believe
they were our friends when actually
plotting our destruction."
