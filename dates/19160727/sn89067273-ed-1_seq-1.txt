PALMER QUITS
IMS CHILDREN
R4'HiiulHlitt All Claims on Them.
Judge Carter Now Has Full Lib
erty to Place Tliem Where IleMuy.
The story will be recalled as pub
lished in the Message last week con
cerning the two Palmer children
abandoned by their parents at Van
dalta and Judge Alex Carter of the
County Court going down and taking
them in charge, bringing them to his
home In Mexico, .furnishing them
with proper clothing and giving the
baby, six months old, which was
sick, necessary medical attention.
In the meantime Judge Carter be
gan a trail of Palmer. He was found
In Chicago. . He was notified that
he must come and care for his chil
dren or he would be prosecuted to
the limit of the law.
Last Thursday Palmer appeared
here. He had all the guise of a
tramp and evidently had beaten his
way thru on the cars. He acknowl
edged everything and said he was
down and out and went before Coun
ty Clerk Ross Cauthorn and relin
quished all claim on his children.
Said he was not able to care for
them. So they are now in the hands
of Judge Carter absolutely, who de
sires to And a home for them, in
some good family. Both are girls,
one, Helen Lucile, aged 10 years,
and the other, the baby, Evelyn El
enor, six months old. They are In
teresting little folks, smart and in
telligent. Palmer is thought to have been
quite well off at one time. He Is on
ly about 35. years old and has been
married three times. We are guess
ing he got a woman or two who
helped him spend Ms money all
right. He inherited his money from
his father.
BARN BURNED.
The barn on James Wilklne' and
A. L, Bruton'a farm near Rush Hill
was destroyed by lightning Wednes

VIEWS & INTERVIEWS
C. C. Heizer: I was in Colorado
Springs several years ago and was so
delighted with the altitude aind good
water that I made up my mind I
must have a home there. But be
fore I got off on my return to Mis
souri there came up a real sleet and
snow storm. There was sleet on the
trees next morning. It was in the
month of August, too. Don't you
kuow that settled It with me? No,
I didn't want a home anywhere in
Colorado alter that.
J. B. Slavens: Have I been away
from home on a visit? Nay, verily.
I've been at work. George Duncan
and 1 are building Buddie Paul's
line new house In the south part of
town.
Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Botkin enjoy

gomery City, Mrs. James Norton of
St. Louis and Miss Julia Hudson of
Oklahoma City, Okla.
S. L. Kobison: Of course the cost
will mount up, as you suggested.
The Message qouted my company a
hundred times too high as to their
bid to furnish oil to oil the Boule
vard. How did you make such a
mistake? You said the bid was
$4.10 per gallon when you should
have said 100 gallons for $4.10.
Live Stock' Reporter: Gray Wil
son, from Audrain county, Mo., had
on the St. Louis market Wednesday
a consignment of beeves which rank
ed well with the best ones on sale.
His price was $9 per cwt. for 17
head of 1385 pounders that were as
fat as corn and proper handling
could make them. The cattle wero
put thru the winter on shock corn
and later finished on bluegrass with
plenty of good yellow corn. The
bunch was of Mr. Wilson's own rais
ing, running largely to Shorthorns
with an incision of Hereford. The
feeding required about six months.
"It was pretty dry up in our sec
tion of the country until a recent
heavy rain," stated the Audrain
countian to a Reporter representa
tive. "This was quite beneficial all
around, especially to the corn, which
is not as large as it should be at this
time of year. Cold weather early is
responsible for this dwarfed condi
tion, but the right kind of weather
will yet bring things all right. There
has been a large area given to corn
and there should be plenty of It.
We have oats In abundance and more
grass than I have ever seen in that
locality."

WAGES
Shall they be determined by
Industrial Warfare or
Federal Inquiry?
To the American Public:
i-
Do you believe in arbitration or indus
trial warfare?
The train employes on all the railroads
are voting whether they will give their leaders
authority to tie up the commerce of the
country to enforce their demands for a 100
million dollar wage increase.
The railroads are in the public service
your service. This army of employes is in
the public service your service.
You pay for rail transportation 3 billion
dollars a year, and 44 cents out of every
dollar from you goes to the employes.
On all the Western railroads in 1915, seventy-five per cent of the
train employes earned these wages (lowest, highest and average
ef all) as shown by the pay roll.-.

A 100 million dollar wage increase for
men in freight and yard service (less than
one-fifth of all employes) is equal to a 5 per
cent advance in all freight rates.
The managers of the railroads, as trustees
for the public, have no right to place this
burden on the cost of transportation to you
Without a clear mandate from a public tri
bunal speaking for you.
The railroads have proposed the settle
ment of this controversy either under the
existing national arbitration law, or by refer
ence to the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. This offer has been refused by the
employes' representatives.
Shall a nation-wide strike or an
investigation under the Gov
ernment determine this issue?

the special program arranged for
their benefit and in charge of County
Superintendent of Sc-nools W. Clyde
Johnson and educators from the
State University.
These events will start in the

proving an added stimulus to their
studies.
Friday will be "Old Settlers' Day"
and already quite a number of men
over 70 years of age have registered
as eligible for tickets on that occa
sion. There will be distributed free
tickets to these pioneers. Special
trains over the South Branch of the
Alton will ba run into Mexico on
on Fair Week. The $500 mule ring
being on Friday promises to add
much to the attendance on that oc
casion. Every day this year will be a big
one. The Fair Is being advertised
thruout this section almost as com
pletely as a circus and the manage
ment feel that Mexico will benefit
largely because of the unusual suc
cess expected of the entertainment
this season.
Attorney Harry Stocks is mention

Judge J. T. Williams, resigned as
Police Judge. Mr. Stocks is all
right. We second his nomination.
