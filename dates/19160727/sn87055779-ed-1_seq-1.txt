HALTIMOIU:, Md., July 27.
With every preparation made and
very legal formality complied with,
the German super-submarine
Ieutschland today still lay at her
dock in Haltimore harbor, ready for
her return dash across the Atlantic.
Every possible precaution has been
taken to safeguard the undersea
boat on her perilous trip through the
enemy-Infested ocean. where war
ships of the allied powers wait to
rapture or destroy her. Hut the
tinal word that would send the
Deutschland down Chesapeake bay
on the first leg of her long Journey
was w ithheld. and Capt. Paul
Koenig waited impatiently for some
mysterious message, the lack of
which has kept the Deutschland at
her dock.
I 'apt. Koenig said today that he
could not say when hi3 craft would
get away. German Consul Carl
Loudcritz, however, after announc
ing that an expected visit of Ambas
sador von Pernstorff to Haltimore
had been indefinitely postponed, de
clared: 'The Peutschlana is fully pre
pared to go, but I believe she will
not be aide to get siway from Balti
more or about a week."
Mas Pilot on Call.
Capt. K enig, with his clearance
papers in 1 is pocket and a pilot on
:l at all hours. was apparently
ready to .nove at a moment's no
tice. Hut between his craft as she
lay at her dock, and the open sea
there are many perils. Two hulking
British freighters, the Highbury and
the Ardgryfe. swung at their an
chors in tht Patapaseo rier just off
the Deutschland" dock. When they
originally dropped anchor they took
u position which would have effect

from leaving her pier. 1 he agents
of the Deutschland after excited
onferences complained to the har
bor authorities and the Ardryfo
was forced to shift her berth. She
did not move far, however, and the
presenct of the two Britishers will
force Capt. Koenig to make an ex
ceedingly careful and laborious start
out of his dock.

International News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 27. The sen
ate foreign relations committee this
afternoon voted to make an adverse
report to the senate on Sen. Mar
tine's resolution and all substitutes
providing for the president to inter
cede in Sir Roger Casement'' behalf.
As soon as the parlimentary situa

Stone will make a report setting
forth the committee's opinion that
adoption of the resolution, or sub
stitutes would be resented by the
British government and -would in

chances for commutation of sen
tence. The committee's adverse action
came as a surprise to the supporters
of the resolution. It had been ex
pected that a modification of the
measure would be recommended.

WASHINGTON. July 27. The
state department today cabled the
British foreign office, through Am
bassador Page at Ijndon. a request
urging that It reconsider its decision
barring from landing at Liverpool,
Thomas Hughes Kelly of New York,
treasurer of the Irish Relief fund,
his wife. Mrs. KYneranee I. S. Kelly.
and his secretary, Joseph Smith of
Bowell. Mass. At the same time
the British ambassador, Sir Cecil
Spring-Rice, cabled a recommenda
tion that his government at least
permit the trio to land in England
even though it later should be found
imprudent to permit them to pro
ceed to Ireland to distribute the $50.
000 that Kelly carried to be used In
relieving the sufferers from the re
cent Irish rebellion.
Many protests demanding that the
United States insist on Kelly being
permitted to finish his relief work
and protesting against the action of
the British foreign office, have reach
ed both state department and the
white house. These came from every
section of the country and some of
them are understood to be couched
in most emphatic language.

Answered Distress Call.
International News Service:
OLNKY. 111., July 27. sStrikins
resemblance to the Orpet case at
Lake Forest is seen in some phases
of the case which has developed
since the arrest of "toy Hinterliter
on a charge of causing the death of
pretty 17-year-old Elizabeth Rat-
cliffe by injecting air into her arter
ies. An indication of what Ilinter
liter's defense will be -was given by
former County Judge II. B. Witcher,
who has been retained by the family
to defend Hinterliter.
It developed that Hinterliter was
one of three admirers of the girl.
The other two are Fred Herrin and
Bill Raiding, now at the border with
Company I fourth Illinois fr.fantry.
According to this version, Hinterliter
was summoned to Olney by two let
ters one from the girl, the other
from one of her admirers.
Discounts Ivileiiv.
There is nothing to show that
Hinterliter was responsible for the
girPs condition." said Judge Witcher.
"There is nothing to show he was re
sponsible for any act of violence.
There was a catheter found, but even
if it is shown that Hinterliter
bought it. there is nothing to show
he used it. He only answered a call
of distress and wanted only to aid
the girl. Another boy who before
had tried to cast suspicion of guilt
on Hinterliter, also wrote him to
come to Olney that particular night."
Judge Witcher declined to give
the name of the other Loy. Hinter
liter's family is well to do. His
mother is owner of much valuable
farming lands and the family has
many wealthy friends. The boy has
always been known as a clean cut
young chap, thrifty and given to at
tending to his business of farming.
No attempt is Indicated on the part
of the state to show any intent to
kill it is only charged that the girl
came to her death as the result of an
attempt at an operation which the
law does not countenance.
Sheriff West is guarding his pris
oner closely and because of the va
