OUR BOYS OFF TO
MEXICAN BORDER,
Left Camp Near Alexandria
Last Thursday.
Alexandria, La., July 20.-The
First infantry regiment, Louisi
ana National Guard, under com
mand of Col. Frank Stubbs, of
Monroe, left Camp Stafford this
afternoon en route to San Benito
Texas, for border duty. The
troops traveled ver the Iron
Mountain railroad to Kinder,
where the trains were transferred
to the Frisco line. Plans had
been perfected for the men to go
over the Texas and Pacific rail
way by way of Longview, Texas,
but Wednesday orders were re
ceived that they were to go over
the Iron Mountain route.
The rolling stock, consisting of
tourist sleeper, standard pull
mans, baggage and freight cars,
arrived at the union station here
last night and early this morning
were transferred to Camp Staf
ford, where the lighter equipment
consisting of kitchen utensils and
the pbrsonal effects of the men
were loaded. The heavier equip.
ment, such as tents, wapots, etc.,
were also loaded.
The trains were run in three
sections. Each section consisted
of nine sleepers and eignt freight
ears. There are 1260 men in the
regiment. There were fifty men
allotted to each sleeper. The
hospitaeorpse did not leave, but
will remain at Camp Stafford S
week longer. There are eighty
men in this command.
The trains were made up at
Camp Stafford and there was no
delay in getting away after pull- 1
ing out, as was the case when the
artillery and cavalry left Tues
day. It was announced that the
troops would leave Camp Staf
ford at 3 p. m., but the soldiers
began to entrain shortly after
noon and at 3:15 the last train C
passed the union station. An e
immense crowd had gatherrd at
the station, being under the im
pression that the trains would be
allowed to'stop for a few minutes,t
but they were not allowed to do
80.
Wives, mothers and bweet
hearts had gathered to say fare
well to the soldier boys of Com
pany M. the local command, and
to present them with with lunches
and other delicacies, which had I
been prepared . fer them, and
great was the disappointment
when they found that they would
not be allowed to stop. They had
to content themselves with way
ing a fond good-bye. The first
section passed the union station
at 2:45 p. m., and the other two
sections followed immediatel .
Many Americans
Return to Mexico.
Laredo, Texas, July 19,-The
tide of travel across the interna
tional bridge here again has
turned southward, and for every
American refugee reaching the
border from interior Mexico three
are entering Mexico to re-engage
in pursuits hastily abandoned re
oently when war appeared im.
ihinent, aooording to immigration
officers here.
Mexioans unusually well in
formed stated that 26,000 soldiers
are stationed close to the border
between Piedras Negras and Mat
a moros. Thebe men, they stat
ed, are sno ring from lack of
corn and are raiding Mexican
ranches to provide cattle for the
uwe of the de faoto brmIy.
is Louisiana Infantry At Border
Town.
ie San Benito, Tex., July 22.
ii- The First Louisiana Infantry
n- reached San Benito at 5 o'clock
)f Saturday morning and immedi.
is ately the men set to work to un
to load their equipment and pitch
ie their tents.
n The men are highly pleased
r, with their new station which is in
I a beautiful section of Texas. San
d Benito is five miles from the
o Rio Grande and there are 50,000
troops in the immediate vicinity.
, The First Louisiana infantry,
Saccording to railroad officials,
r has broken all records for quiet
and soldierly conduct on the trip
f to he border. There has been
- little or no cheering and what
, singing was done so low that it
e could hardly be heard from one
end of the car to the other.
The men have been behaving like
t regulars and at one of the Texas
towns were mistaken for regulars
by a tall Texan who said:
"You boys are regulars, aren't
you? No? Well, I declare you
surely are differeut from the
other militia outfits. They came
through singing and cheering and
raising all kinds of cane, but you
fellows are quiet like the regular
soldiers are when traveling."
Every possible arrangement
for the comfort and envenienoe
of the men had been made by the
officers.
Shortly after 5'olook Thursday
the first train meal was served.
This consisted of corn beef, pip
ing hot hard tack soft bread, jam
and delioious coffee. The cooking
detail of each company brought
the food in pans through the
train and the men used their
mess kits to eat from. And then,
luxury unsurpassed, the cooking
detail with great pans of hot wat
er, passed through, washed and
dried the aluminum dishes and
returned them to their owners.
Then white sheets in the sleeping
berths, taps and lights out and
the regiment slept.
When Captain Stanley F.
Davis, of company I, Amite, re
viewed his command on the train
Friday morniug, among the men
was Octave Spring, a young
member of a well-known Tangi.
pahoa family, and former mem
ber of the company. The doctors
at Camp Stafford, after an ex
aminetion had rejected Spring,
as it was found that he was very
much under weight. Everyone
thought he had gone home, ,.but
Friday morning found Octave
Spring with his company. How
he got there no one knew, but
when asked how he came he an.
swered briskly.
"I just wanted to go with the
boys, and so came along. I
don't want to be left out of the
scrap if there is one."
But discipline is discipline and
regulations are regulations and
while greatly appreciating
,willingness to go, it was neces
sary to order him from the train
at one of the larger stations.
Spring took his ejection with a
grin.
"Shucks!" he exclaimed, "you
can't lose me that easy. I'll grab
a freight and meet you in San
Benito."
Those who know Spring say
that the chances are that he will.
f Villa was reported to have
2 mnrdered the son of General
S Garoia who defeated him recently
near Psrral.
