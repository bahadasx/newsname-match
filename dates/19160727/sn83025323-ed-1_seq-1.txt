JUD)GE~ UTTEit'S PLJATIFORM
We wish to gail the attention 01,
ithe voters of tliy Seventeenth Judi
cial District to some of the planks In
Judge Utter's plartorto and show the
incnsstecyof his remarks and his
atiuetoward the pubhie and how
little interact he really has in the
welfare of the taxpayers.
He has caused to he printed and
scattered over the district cards
which read something like this:
"I shall in the future as I have in the
past make my decisions upon the
law as passed by the legislature and
interpreted by the supreme court.'
NNow let us see just how this plank
works out in practice. Some time
ago Judge Utter presided in a case in
Valley county in which Jones sued
Shannon. A jury of twelve men
brought in a verdict in favor of the
plaintiff in the sum of one thousand
dollars. The judge gave the jury a
lecture and attemqted to reduce the
verdict to a few hundred dollars.
The case was taken to the supreme
court, which not only sustained the
jury's verdict of $1000, but taxed
the costs, amounting to $50.50, to
Judge Utter. Does this look like
he had made his decision on the law
as apssed by the legislature and in
terpreted by the supreme court?
When he starts in on the third
plank of his platform it reads like~a
joke in the face of what happened
here a week or so ago. It reads, "I
shall in the future as I have in the
past keep court expenses as low as
possible; arrange terms of court 'at
the convenience of the farmers and
excuse jurors whose attendance
would cause their properly to suffer
material damage."
Judge Utter is the jutdge who or
dered the jury called for the first
term of court in Phillips county, and
is the same judge who dismissed
the jury and continued all the cases.
Phillips county taxpayers paid the
bill, which amounted to a few thous
sand dollars. Is it not the dtity of a
judge when a jury is called tu know
whether the cases will be tried or
not.
He is the samce judge who calls
large juries and the samue one who
excuses any aunt er ot them it' he
deems it niecessary lo his owna ends.
Not including th( first jary called
there his been .;15 juto0s called fork
serv-ice in Phitllips outyli itid out of"
1losa iituiinhr onily too ihavxe serived.
Clint. means the restr haxve bIna ex
ds] rid not report fot ditty
hut the iinunber iiot repool nag is very
amall. Every j uror who conies iutt
town to attend courit will cost the
outonaavrgofs etglike twenty dollars. Does this lortk
like lie was trying to keep court ex- 1
iltilsts dowin?
Wheni the county jail is allowveid to
reiaini f ull tor' six month~ils dioes it ie-c
dace the court, expenise?
We went to see a niati electedto 1
the office of judge of the Seventeenth
Judicial district who wvill not unlyiv
preach econtomy hut practice it as
well, and in our opinion Johim Hotly
ith mathtsolreevth)united support of thet republicans
at the primaries next month.
M(cG'GRRi I'PEi~EVED
Attorney WV. E. McGarry, one of
the democratic candidates tor the
office of county attorney, was much
peevedl at our remarks about Judge
Utter last week. We were not of the
opinion, however, that the truth
about the judge would hurt Mr. Nic
Garry quite so much and if it does
he will have to nurse the sore spot.
We play no favorites and had the
candidate for county attorney, who
styles himself the "Able, Active,
Aggressive," attended to his own
campaign these lines would not have
appeared in this issue.
It hardly behooves a man who is
not even a voter in the county, and is
running for office, to meddle with
something that lie knows little or
nothing about. At any rate the voters
of the county will take Mr. McGar
ry's candidacy with a grain of salt.
as Phillips county had one of those
over-night attorneys for county at
torney when the county was organ
ized and the taxpayers are several
thousand dollars poorer thani they
would have been had a resident at
torney been elected.
WEDDEI) IN MALTA

Early this morning when one ot
the clerks at the Lewis- Wedltt tie
partment store, was about to take
some bananas from a hunch hanging
in the grocery department, he not iced
something queer on the wall and Ott
examining discovered it was one of
the dreaded poisonous trantulas, so
much feared in the south. The crea
ture was of an exceptionally large
large size and is being kept alive for
a few days at the store, where it. can
be seen . No one was unfortunate
enough to be bitten by it--Glasgow

324) Al 'Rl'S FOR ALL, NO AA
e S t sit ear's ago congress ~passes
if the enlarged homestead act, whicit
o provided for the entry of 320 acre
,t homesteads on all lands designated
d by the department as non-irrigable,
r the old 18O-acre homestead law still
-,being applicable to all lands suscep
d1 tibie to irrigation.
Many million acres of dry farm
e jkind have been entered under the
e 320-acre act. In many cases, how
e ever, the homesteader entered a less
a amount than the full maximum al
y lowance 320 acres.
On July 3, the president signed the
e amendment to the original 320 en
larged homestead act, giving to all
s homesteaders, who had heretofore
e entered less than 320 acres the right
-s to now make entry on additional
lands, so as to give him the full
tacreage allowed in the first act.
Under the new law the additional
entry need not be contiguous to his
original entry. The nw act also pro
vides that where the additional en
v try is situated more than 20 miles
distant from his original homestead.
the entrymant need not reside on the
new homestead. Additional entries
are limited to lands which have been
by proclamation designated as "dry
farming lands."
Thousands of people throughout
the northwest will no doubt avail
-themselves of the provisions of the
new law, which is herewith repro
-duced at length:

Drll four hours every day now is
the program for the troops of the
Second Montana regiment. The boy's
are certainly rounding into shape
rapidly at this pace. They are not
the same ragged bunch of militiamen
that reached Fort Harrison a few
days sifter the order camse to mobil
ize. but are a rugged, burned, husky
united regular.
The climate here has not affected
any of them as there has been no
real hot weather outside of the first
day in camp. The second day here
the eight weeks rainy season started
and it has rained practically every
day since that time.
The boys are falling to the work
here like a hunch of old timers. All
brush has been cleared from the
camp grounds, the ground leveled
off, incinerators built out of adobe
bricks, ovens made out of the same
{article, streets graded so that the
water will not stand in front of the
camp. Much praise has been given
the boys to the Montana regiment by
Ithe btusiness meln of Douglas on the
neat appearance of their camp. The
strictest regulations prevail as to
sanitary conditions and not even a
scrap of paper is allowed to be
thrown aroundn the ground.
The incinerators that are used for
the burning of all refuse froxm the
camp kitchens are worthy of men
tion, and their construction may be
0f interest to those back in Montana.
Thie brick used are about three
inches thick and eight by twelve.
Thley are made by mixing straw and
grass in lhe samte way that mortar its
mole wi ti the adobe. Thbis is stirred
and set out in a traine to dry. When
