TWO MEXICANS SHOOT
UP THE TOWN
Thinks Well of Williams
Mr. Jesse C. Wanslee of Phoenix
visited Williams last week. Mr.
Wanslee is an attorney of experi
ence and ability. He is looking
for a location in Coconino county
and thot very well of Williams.
Two young Mexicans' Louis
Montoya and Abicio Rnl, caused
some excitement in Williams last
Saturday night by a free use of
their revolvers. They emptied
their guns by shooting ; into a
crowd m front of -the- Cabinet res
taurant and then securing more
munitions for their weapons they
proceeded to fire off their guns in
different parts of town. The fusi-
lade in front of the restaurant re
sulted in a wound in the head for
Jose Balderez and a wound in the
breast for Frauk Sereno. Neither
wound is serious. No other casual
ties have been reported except the
death of a cow which . the vounj
desperadoes are supposed to have
killed wantonly or thru accident.
The night watchmen sought
MontcQo and Del for the purpose
of arresting them but their nrr-h
was in vain. The Town Marshal
was called and in a short time he
had the Mexicans in the Town iail.
They were disposed to resist arrest
but a shot from the marshnl'a criin
convinced them that surrender was
the better policy.
Mondav morniner vounc Mmitrwn
and Del were arraigned before
Judge Twitty and he bound them

The residents of Red Lake are a
live, up-to-date bunch. Last year,
without advertising, they announc
ed that a barbecue would be given
in the Magee Wood, near Red Lake;
and those who attended were agree
ably surprised to see a large crowd
preseut between 500 and 600
and one of the most enjoyable
events of the kind ever pulled off
in the county was given. An ex
cellent barbecued dinner was serv
ed, and if anyone left the grounds
hungry it was his own fault for
there was an abundance for all.
The speaking was good: the racing.
broncho busting, trick riding, and
athletics were good, and in the
evening the large crowd enjoyed
dancing until a late hour in the
morning.
The affair proved such a suc
cess that those in charge resolved
to make it an annual event Those
who were in charge of last
year's celebration, together with
other citizens of the county who
were invited to participate; met
to formulate plans for this year's
event. At the meeting it was
determined to hold this year's
barbecue in the same place
Magee's Wood-- on Thursday.
August 17th., and the following
committees were appointed:
Executive: L. S.: Williams,
chairman; C. C. Thomasson, C
C. Carpenter, T. H. Cureton,
and Edward Roupe.
Finance: McDonald Robinson,
Chairman; W. M. Hughes, Geo
McDougall, M. J. Rounseville,
and C C. Thomasson.
Grounds: Edward Roupe, chair
man; C. C. Carpenter, C. C.
Thomasson, Ed. H. Hinds, and
C. B. Hume.

Arrangements are being per
fected to have present a number
of prominent candidates for state
and county offices. Governor
Hunt, Hon. Tom Campbell, Hon.
George Olney, and in fact all
candidates for state offices have
been invited, and no doubt quite
a number will be on hand in the
interest of their candidacy, since
the primary election will be less
than a month from the date of
the barbecue. One of the larg
est crowds ever assemhled ; in
Coconino county is expected.
and arrangements are being
made to insure all, who do attend
a1 royal time. The program will
be announced later by poster
and handbills. . i
E.L. KOLB 1TH PARTY
DARESJEATH AGAIN
Ellsworth Kolb, Daring
Grand Canyon Explorer,
Heads : Expedition . to
Black .Canyon '
Look Out For Your Dog
The Town Council having order
ed the Town Marshal to get rid of
all dogs not wearing the 1916 tax,
tag. I will pay 25 cents apiece for
all such dogs delivered to me. Dog
owners who have dogs worth the
price of the dog tax will do' well
to attach the tag at once.
Bobby Burns,
Town Marshal.
On July 20th, Mr. Ellsworth L, ;
Kolb, and a party of four, consist- v
ing of Julius F; Stone, a banker of
Columbus, Ohio; N. B. Stearns, a
member of a Wall Street banking;
house, and John ' Shields, the
Grand Canyon guide, left Los
Angeles to 'begin the hazardous
trip down the Black Canyon. In
especially constructed boats, they.:
will go down the Gunnison river,,
which pours into the Grand and'
Green rivers and on and into the -mad
Colorado. This portion of
the Black Canyon has never been -explored
by white man, although '.
two government engineers, Fellows--and
Torrence' attempted it several
years ago only to have their boats :
wrecked, and they barely escaped
starvation on the high cliffs where
they had climbed in an attempt -to
reach the rim.
The trip is being made to gather
engineering data for the Denver
and Rio Grande railroad and tr
add more pictures to the already
superb collection of the Kolb Bro-
thers. It covers but thirty miles:.
and they hope to reach thei r des
tination in . ten days, barring
accident?, .. the gorge where the
river flows is walled with sheer 1
cliff, allowing practically no land
ing places, and the danger is as
great as that in the trip taken by
the two Kolb brothers four vears
ago, when they went 1400 miles
down the Colorado in two smalL,
crafts; - . -. :.
The boats to be used are of
special design. One is seventeen
feet long, canvas covered, with air
chambers in either end and separ-.
ate water-tieht ' compartments..
which are removable, and is similar
to the one used by Mr. Roosevelt .
during his"' South African explor- "
ation. There is also a fourteen-
foot boat, an oval-shaped raft and
swimming suits which provide-
buoyancy, warmth and ' safety,
while in the water. Ah indestructo-
trunk provides aa acciclent and
water-proof place for storing the
moving picture camera, films and
necessary photographic supplies.
The Kolb Brothers are known
aljover the United States as ex
plorers and scenic pnotographers,
and have received commendatory
write-ups in such publications as.
The National Geographical Mag-'
azines, The Saturday Evening'
Post and The American Magazine.
