Petrograd, July 27. Heavy rains are impeding the
pxogress of the Russian drive into Northern Galicia. The
Styr, Stochod and Lipa rivers are swollen over their
banks and the sticky marshes hedging the Stochod in
particular have been rendered even more impossible.
Russian forces are battling against the elements as well
as against the Teutons, but notwithstanding are steadily
forcing onward. Brody is harrassed on two sides by a
Russian battering ram which is gradually crushing the
resistance of the Austrians.
On the extreme north General. Kurop.tkin's forces are
successfully repulsing furious assaults by General Von
Hindenburg, inflicting heavy losses on the Teutonic
columns.

Capture of a large quantity of war material by the

The war office statement did not detail the booty but an

nounced advances and repulses of attacks. At only one
point was a Russian attack stopped and this was where
a single company of Russian troops attacking the enemy
south of Lake Voltchino, encountered superior forces and
was driven back.
In the district of Lobuzy the battle
was confined to artillery engagements,

Operations in today's stock market
were light in all part's of the list with

rection of lower levels. The moro im

issues in which investment buying was
reported.
At times in the afternoon trading
came almost to a standstill, even active
efforts by professionals against the
poorest variety of stocks failing to ex
cite any interest in the market. And
efforts to bring about stock rise in the
rails failed to create anything more
thau passing attention, although they
carried prices lower.
The small offerings of these issues
were quickly absorbed by representa

COL. BUTLER'S WIFE

Officer Making Investigation
Reports He Had Right To
' Be with Mrs. Spannell
San Antonio, Texns, July 27. The
widow of l.ieut. Col. M. (', Butler slain
by Harry Spannell, hatel proprietor,
in Alpine last week, will receive a
IKMisiim. The official report of Col.
J. A. Gaston, commander in that dis
trict, clears Butler's name and assigns
unreasonable ienlousy as SpniiucH's
motive in shooting his wife and But
ler. According to the urmy code, the
fact that Butler .had a "moral right "
to be with .Mrs. Spannell shows he
died "in the line of duty," willed
must be proven if a soldier's widow is
entitled to a pension.
According to Gaston's report, Span
nell had an argument with Butler n
bout .Mrs. Spannell prior to the shoot
ing, after which Butler avoided Mrs.
Spun noli as much ns possible. Knrlicr
in the day of the shooting, Butler and
Spannell, with their wives, culled on
a mutual friend who was ill. Tpon re
turning to the Holland hotel, of which
.S ji n iiell is prjprietor, the two wom
en went o Butler 'a rooms. Mrs. Butler
left tne room for a moment and Span
nell, entering, upbraided his wife tor
being nlouo in Butler's room Mrs.
Butler returned, ending the argument.
This was suid by Gustun to have been
the immediate cause of the shooting.
Soon after Siiniiell took his wife ami
Butler for ail automobile ride and shot
them both. He gave himself up and
is now in the county jail nt Kl Pnso.

San Francisco, July 27. District At
torney Fickert at 0:30 today admitted
that the police had arrested another
man in connection with the dynamit
ing conspiracy, who has not as yet ap
peared .in the case. He declined to
give any clew t the name of the mnn
or to divulge where he is being held.
Fickert would not confirm reports
that still another muu had been arrest
ed hero.
Unconfirmed reports were also cur
rent that Thomas Mooney, who recently
failed in un attempt to organize an Uni
ted linilronds strike here, had been lo
cated iu l.os Angeles.
Israel Weinburg, a jitney bus driver
who wns detained at the same timo ns
Mrs. Belle t.uviu, was examined ngnin
by the bomb squad today regarding the
disappearance of Mooney nnd his wife.
It is not known whether he has informa
tion of value to tho police.
Captain Duncan Mnthosou, head of
the bomb squad, declares that so far
thero have becu no confessions, but
thero is n strong belief among at
taches at tho hall of justice that tho
police have some definite information
from a reliable source and are not by
any means working iu the dark.
"All our information indicates that
this crime was but one of a series of
bomb outrages planned for San Fran
cisco and vicinity," said Mathesou.
"The plot will bo shown to bo very
wide spread when all the fuels are made
public.
"Wo find that Thomas Mooney left
Sail Francisco Suturdny afternoon at 4
o'clock. We believe we know where
he is, but beyond that I can say noth
ing. We are looking for his wife mere
ly for Mooney himself."
They Want Thomas Mooney.
San Francisco, Cab, July 27. With
one bomb suspect under arrest and Mrs.
Belle l.uvin detained for examination,
the nulico todnv sent requests all over
I the country for the detention of Thomas
Mooney, who, they believe, may give
them further information regarding the
bomb outrngo here which has already
cost nine lives.
Such closo secrecy has been miiiutuin
ed regarding the activities of the spe
cial bomb squad of the department,
that the police will not even admit
that Warren K. Billings is under ar
rest, although froln other sources it is
known that ho is. Billings, who hus
served n term iu Folsom prison for car
rying dynamite on a passenger train,
wns taken into custody at Lane hospital
when ho appeared at the free clinic
tncre for treatment. No newspaper
men have been permitted to see him and
a "sweating" which was begun yester
day, continued today.
immediately after Billings' arrest, po
lice hurried to the lodging house of Mrs.
Belle l.avin, where Billings roomed,
searched his room and took Mrs. l.uvin
into custody. This was the house nt
which Muthew A. Schmidt and James B.
McNiiniiua stayed when they were plan
ning the dynamiting of the Los Angeles
Times building six years ago. At thut
time Mrs. l.avin was detained. She was
cross-examined at length today.
Tho search of Billings' room disclosed
2n0 steel nosed cartridges of .22 and .32
calibre, hidden iu a tin box. According
to the police, these coincide with bul
lets picked up near Hteuart nnd Mur
ket streets Saturday after the bomb ex
plosion. An automatic jdstol was also
found iu tho room.
The latest bomb theory of the police,
it was stilted today, is thut the infernal
machine wns exploded iu an effort to
kill or in ni in representatives of tho
L'nifcd Hnilronds who were marching in
the parade. Mooney, who recently at
tempted to start a strike of United
Itnilroads platform men, is wanted in
the belief that he may have information
that will be of value to the police in
this connection.
Photographs of Billings were shown
today to Newton Potter, proprietor of
the Metal Welding Works, who recently
sold two strangers a steel container for
explosives, similar to the one believed
to have been used in Saturday's infern
al machine. He was uuable to Identify
Hillings as one of the two men.
With the death last night of Thomas

Orders for tho vessel to co out over

Inasmuch as . news of the Bremen
was tho determining factor in the mat
ter of the Deutschlund sailing, it waa
accepted as true that at la.st the
Deutschlund 's sister ship had been
heard from.
Perhaps, it was said, the Bremen
had met with mishap and that the
Deutschland would not make an at

tho other hand it was suggested choer
