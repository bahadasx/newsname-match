the reform school at St. Anthony with
Dave and Otis Radford, aged 8 and 10
years, the boys who last Sunday entered
the Paris Millinery and destroyed the
cash register and committed other un
lawful acts. They are also accused of
other juvenile depredations. They have
no mother and their father being unable

care it was thought best to give them a
term in the reform school.
FISHERMEN TO GO UP BRANCH

fisherwomen, too) are organizing to

for a meal or two.

ARMSTRONG TO GO
TO UNION PACIFIC
Upon good authority it is stated that
W. R. Armstrong, general manager and
chief engineer of the Orem lines in
Utah, wiil go to Omaha on August 1 as]
assistant chief engineer of the Union
Pacific railroad, which position has re-1
cently been created to place an engin
eer on the staff of the general manager j
who shall have direct charge of main
tenance matters. j
Mr. Armstrong is fl'etl qualified for j
such a position, having had an experi
ence of twenty-five years in railroad
work as construction and maintenance
engineer and operating official. He
came to the Oregon Short Line in 1905,
when that road operated the Union Pa
cific and Southern Pacific from Green
River, Wyoming, to Reno, Nevada. For
several months he did special engineer
ing work on these roads. In 1906 he was
the engineer in charge of the construc
tion of the Yellowstone Park railroad
and the road from Huntington , to
Homestead down the Spake river can
yon in Oregon.

and Clias. Cummings have been arrested
and charged with gambling in Camp

cent murder. They were admitted to
bail and have employed Attorney Dy
gert to defend them. Mr. Dygert today

OFFICER CHARGED WITH
UNJUSTIFIABLE MURDER
j
j
j
Complaints linvp frequently been
made that gambling has been carried
on in a certain residence in the south
ern suburbs of Blackfoot where dwells
O. Campbell and wife
Last Sunday morning a rrid was
planned on the alleged gambling rendez
vous by Deputy Sheriffs Dann, Thomp
son and Chamberlain. Arriving at the
place of their operations and seeing
a dim light the officers held a brief
consultation before attempting to make
tlie raid, after which Officer Dann ad
vanced to the porch and after peeping
through the bottom of tlie window
shade approached the door, throwing
himself violently against and at the
same time shooting through it and de
manding an entrance in the name of
the law. Mr. Campbell, better known
as "Bill," and who poses as a horse
buyer, unlatched the door and let the
officer in. From all accounts there were
four or five men playing cards when
the officer tried to force an entrance,
but when the shot was fired through
the door they all made their escape ex
cepting John Harvey, who remained sit
ting at the table until the officer made
his appearance on the threshhold of the
door and he was shot on the left side of
the neck, when lie arose and fell for
ward mortally wounded.
Campbell asked Dann to send for a
doctor, but before Dr. Davis arrived
on the scene tlie unfortunate man was
dead. Coroner I'eck was then sent for
and hail the body removed to tlie
Brown-Eldredge Undertaking l'arlors.
Officers Thompson and Chamberlain,
who had .entered the house after the
man had fallen to the floor, wishing to
wash their hands of any blame for the
killing, gave their loaded pistols to the
coroner, but Dann did not surrender his
until the next day when it had but one
chamber empty.
Campbell testified that they had been
playing cards, but not for money, and
no evidence of money was found. He
testified that the door was only latched,
and that none of - the party playing
cards had a gun, and none was found
by the officers.
One of the officers says that lie be
lieves there were three shots fired, the
first of which entered the door, the
second lodging in the dead man's body,
and tlie third he believes was fired at
random by one of the card party who
made his escape.
None of the shots took effect but the
one that killed the young farmer who
was a comparative stranger "in this
neighborhood. Although there was con
siderable .contradictory testimony given
at the coroner's inquest, and one of
witnesses, Jess Sutton, was arrested for
perjury, tlie eoncensus of opinion is that
the killing was an unnecessary and cruel
act and should be thoroughly investigat
ed and the perpetrator of it brought to
justice.
Monday morning Coroner Peck im
panelled a coroner's jury, who spent
PARIS MILLINERY BROKEN INTO
Last Saturday night some one broke
into the Baris Millinery and stole some
of the stock. They also broke the cash
register to pieces but secured no money,
as the cash was stored in tlie safe.
The loss was discovered Sunday when
Miss Waite stopped into the store. She
called Marshal Sewell, who discovered
a trail leading up the outside back
stairs to a window, which had been
broken, thus permitting ingress to the
building and into the store.
The thief has not been found, but
Mr. Sewell is of the opinion that it was
some boy or at most a mere amateur at
the business.
BIG TIME AT THOMAS THE 24TH
Pioneer Day at Thomas was a grand
affair and the program was very good.
A big crowd was in attendance and
there was plenty of sport and fun all
day long. The day's program terminated
with a jolly dance at night, which was
well attended by the many celebrants
who all wished the Pioneers many happv
returns of the day.

appearance in his office yesterday. Hy
regrets very much the unfortunate kill
ing of John Harvey, and sympathizes
with his deputy who is charged with his
death, lie stated that Mr. Dunn had
a number of good qualities, but as an
officer lie was altogether too excitable
and erratic, lie has promoted Jailer
Thompson to bo his head deputy, and

Jess Hutton, who is under arrest and
bonds on a charge of perjury, gave a

death. Interment was today.

Harvey for the past three months, says
he was a' trustworthy, sober man, but
that gambling seemed to tie his beset
ting sin and great misfortune, and stat
ed that he* knows from the deceased's
own lips that he recently lost his watch
and wages ehasing fickle fortune on the
green cloth in Blackfoot.

MAKING A NAME FOR A TOWN
The citizens of every town have it
within their power to make or mar
their own municipal name. It will be
good or bad, just ns they choose to
make it.
We of this town are no exceptions
to tlie rule, hud the citizen who loves
his own home will always bear it in
iniud.
There arc many good points in favor
of .our community, and when the
stranger «unes to our midst we should
not fail to impress these faets upon his
mind.
We should take hint in hand, exhibit
the community as you would a blooded
horse, let him understand that he is
among a fair minded, energetic nnd gen
erous hearted people, and when he goes
to other climes he will speak as lie lias
been spoken to. ,
That is the way reputations are made.
But there is another side, and it is
there that, mischief is too often done.
The stranger enters our door and w>*
immediately begin to complain of the
community and of the people. Nothing
just suits us. Nothing is as it should be.
Everything is wrong and the town is
on the way to tie* ihigs.
And again the stranger speaks as lie
sees and hears.
That is the way reputations are de
stroyed.
Which is it to be with us?
BLACKFOOT VS. KANSAS CITY
Monday the Blackfoot base ball team
played the Red Hocks of Kansas City.
It was an even game, the score being
8 to 9 in favor of Kansas City. This
is the first game that the Blackfoot
team has lost for some time, and if it
hadn't been for some careless playing
on tlie part of the outfield, the Grove
City would probably have won the
game. As it was, they had reason to be
proud as it is said that the peregrinat
ing ball tonnera from Kansas City have
won nearly every game played this sea
son.

From a Woman's Point
of View
T he element of uncertain
tv which is always prevalent in
the stock market does not. as a
rule, attract women who have money to
invest.
They rather prefer an assurance of ab
solute safety for the principal and a de
finitely established rate of income.
These and many other desirable qualities
characterize the Certificates of Deposit
issued by this Institution for any
amount from $1.00 upward.

IDAHO
WILL PROSECUTE
HER FATHER
Miss Kate Dyson, in charge of Deputy
Sheriff Dann, arrived in Blackfoot last
Thursday to appear as a witness against
her father, who is in jail charged with
tlie crime of incest with her for the
past seven years.
Another charge of statutory rape ha s
been placed against the unnatural
father. As the crime of incest is punish
able by imprisonment of only 10 year-:,
and the latter charge has a lifelong
penalty, it is thought that the defend
ant is getting ready to plead to the
lesser crime. Ferguson and Baum are
his attorneys, not Hansbrough & Gagon
and Ed. Holden as was stated in this
paper last week, and which Attorney
Gagon objected to.
