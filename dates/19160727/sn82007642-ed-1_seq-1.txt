Frtshit Caascs Mich Damagi at River
side, N. C.
'foo late for iast, issue.
Editor Democrat: Last Satur
day, July 15, the heavy down
pour of rain, added to the flush
waters caused by the heavy
rains just one week before, swell
ed New River out of its banks
over the bottom lands from hill
to thill. The damage to lands,
crops and buildings cannot be es
timated. The V. C. Railway was
greatly damaged, a number of
washouts are reported along the
line, which will take 30 days or
more to repair the road so trains
can pass.
Rich river bottoms which a week
ago were green with growing
crops, or dotted with shocks of
small grain, are now, in many
places, covered with sand and
rocks, with all kinds of crops
completely destroyed.
The greatest damage reported
bo far, is at Riverside Station, as
Rev. Asa Brown lost his large
barn; George Greer his dwelling
and contents; J. 8. Brown's ware
house and barn 1 were carried a
way, and his storehouse was lift
ed from its foundation and turn
ed around, but was not seriously
damaged. Much lumber and tan
bark at Riverside was swept a
way. Mr. A. G. Miller's store, loca
ted at . i he McGwire old Btand,
was greatly damaged, as he was
forced to carry out a great part
of his goods through the driving
rain to a place of safety, and just
after dark Saturday night, the
the store house, in which the
post office was located, was lift
ed from its Dillars. and carried
about thirty yards, drifting a
gainst some trees turning around
and lodging agains the corner of
his dwellings hoflsfi,:- completely
blockino;lthuifliC'road from
Elkland to Riverside.' '
Mr. G. HrMcGuire, living just
across the river, lost his wood
house and lots of wood, besides
being forced to carry his things
out of his house to higher ground.
Near the mouth of Grassy
Creek, the river swept off Bob
Phillips' dwelling house, with a
part of its furnishings. It is re
ported that the big mills located
near Bowie, on the v.C. railroad,
owned bv Mr. L. S. Vannoy and
Calvin Payne, was destroyed by
the rushing waters of a large
creek on which the mills were lo
cated. This occurrence is heard
with profound regret on the part
of Mr. Payne, as he bad traded
bis farm to Mr. Vannoy for half
interest .in the mills, having a
family to' support, and his prop
erty gone. Mr. Payne is a splen
did citizen, and should have the
sympathy of all.
. Mr. Editor, I might give other
particulars concerning the devas
tation wrought by the terrible
flood, but for fear of making my
article too long, I will close by
quoting Gov. Bob Taylor's beau
tijul tribute to the power of God
which follows:
"I saw the awful majesty and
might of Jehovah, flying on the
. wings of the tempest, planting
His footsteps on the trackless
deep, veiled in darkness and in
clouds. God is everywhere and in
everything. His mystery is in ev
erybud and blossom, and lea
and tree; in every rock and hil
and yale and mountain; in every
stream and rivulet and river.
The rustle of His wing in every
lepbyr, its might in every tem
pest. He dwella iu the dark pa
villions of every storm cloud.
The lightning is His messenger
and the thunder Hisvoice. His
awful tread is in every earth
'" quake and on every angry ocean';
and the heavens above us-:' teem
with His myriads of shinifcjpwit-
nesses: the universe of solar sys

Rural Credit Bill Signed by President
Washington, July 17. The ru
ral credits bill, which created
twelve land loan banks under the
direction of a Federal board, be
came a law today, when Presi
dent Wilson placed his signature
to the measure, in the presence
of Senators, Representatives and
officers of farmers' organizations.
When the nation's executive had
placed bis name to the bill, those
present gave him a generous ap
plause. Just before signing the meas
ure the President made a short
address expressing the benefit he
believes farms and the invest
ment community will enjoy un
der its operation.
"On occasions of this, sort,"
said the President, "there are so
many things to say that one
would despair of saying them
briefly and adequately, but lean
not go through the simple cere
mony of signing this bill with
out expressing the feeling that I
have in signing it. 1 1 is a feeling
of profound satisfaction uot only
ot real gratitude that we have
completed this piece of legisla
tion which I hope will be immen
sely beneficial to the farmers of
the country.
"The farmers it seems to me
lave occupied hitherto a eingu
ar position of disadvantage.
Phey have not had the same free
dom to get credit on their real
estate that others have bad who
were in manufacturing and com
mercial enterprises, and while
they have sustained our life, they
did not in the same degree with
some others share in the benefits
of that life.
'Therefore, this bill along with
the very liberal provisions of the
Federal reserve act, puts them
upon an equality with all others
who have general genuine assets
and makes the great credit of the
country available to them. One
cannot but feel that this is de
layed justice to them, and can
not but feel that it is a very grat
ifying thing to play any party in
doing this action of justice. I
look forward to the benefits of
this bill not with extravagant
pxpectations, but' with confident
assurance that it will be of very
wide reaching benefits; and, inci
dentally, it will be of advantage
to the investmentcomtnunityfor
I can imagine no more satisfac
tory and solid investment this
svstera will afford those who
have money to use.
"I sign the bill, therefore, with
real emotion and am very glad
indeed to be honored by your
presence, and supported by your
feelings. 1 have no doubt in what
I have said regarding it."
The President used two pens
in signing the bill and gave one
of them to Senator Fletcher, of
Florida, who asked permission
to present it to the Southern
Commercial Congress.
Secretary McAdoo conferred
with the President on the selec
tion of the members of thenew
farm loan board, who will bo ap
pointed iu the near future.

Mr. DouzbtoD Enthusiastic Over the!
Good Roads Bill Recently Passed.
Congressman Doughton was
interviewed some days ago by
newspaper men in Washington
upon the merits of the Good
Roads Bill recently signed by
the President, and gave out the
following, which makes interest
ing reading, Mr. Doughton be
ing a' member of the House Com
mittee on Good Roads:
"This bill is both educational
and constructive. The national
funds contributed to the States
can be only spent on roads that
are well designed and well built,
and also roads where, after their
construction, arrangements are
made by which they will be
maintained. It gives to the
State highway officials of each
State all the scientific knowledge
and practical skill of the Bureau
of Roads of the United Statts
and the Department of Agricul
ture. In this way, the bast and
most enlightened thought of the
nation, and the judgement and
experience ot the most expert
officials of the country on the
subject of road building will be
vitalized and made manifest.
Our people need education and
information as to the best method
of constructing and keeping up
roads, as badly as they need
money with which to do the
work, and by this law; the know!
edge and financial strength neces
sary are combined. It is a straight
business law. One third of the
amount of the Federal appro
priation will be apportioned a-
mong the States in proportion
to their population; one-third in
proportion to their area, and
another third in proportion to
their mileage of rural free delive
ry and star routes. This method
f distributing tho amount is ac
knowledged to be the best yet
devised.
"This law is bound to become
a powerful agent in lifting the
country people out of the mud,
and giving farmers access to the
markets; encouraging young
people to remain in rural com
munities, and bettering iu a large
measure the social life of all ru
ral communities.
"This legislation has been de
manded by all parts of the coun
try for many years, and I am
happy to say that this Congress
qas responded to that just and
insisted t demand."
"It required a long, hard, up
hill road," said ho, "to get this
legislation. It was very difficult
to convince Congress of the jus.
tice and necessity of Federal aid
for the construction of rural
highways. However, I feel that
the enactment of the present
law, which has been signed by
President this week, marks the
beginning of a permanent policy
of i ederal aid to road construc
tion and road up-keep in the ru
ral communities throughout the
country. This bill carries an
appropriation of $75,000,000 by
the Federal government, to be
expended during a period of five
years. First year, ?5,000,000;
second year, 110,000,000; third
year, $15,000,000; fourth year,
$20,000,000; and the fifth year,
$25,000,000-making a total of
$75,000,000.
"Before this fund can be avail
able to any State, it must ap
propriate an equal amount,
which amount will doubtless be
supplemented by the counties and
local communities of the State,
and will make an aggregate am
ount sufficient to revolutionize
road building iu North Carolina.
Coming at a time when our peo
ple are wide-awake to the neces
sity of road improvement, it wil
m my judgement, prove of incal
culable benefit to the State,, far
ahead of anything that we have
ever bad of this kind, '

WAGES
Shall they be determined by
Industrial Warfare or
Federal Inquiry?
To the American Public:
Do you believe in arbitration or indus
trial warfare?
The train employes on all the railroads
are voting whether they will give their leaders
authority to tie up the commerce of the .
country to enforce their demands for a 100
million dollar wage increase.
The railroads are in the public service
your service. This army of employes is in
the public service your service.
You pay for rail transportation 3 billion
dollars a year, and 44 cents out of every
dollar from you goes to the employes.
On all the Southern railroads in 1915, seventy-five per cent of the
train employes earned these wages (lowest, highest and average
of all) as shown by the payrolls

A 100 million dollar wage increase for
men in freight and yard service (less than
one-fifth of all employes) is equal to a 5 per
cent advance in all freight rates.
The managers of the railroads, as trustees
for the public, have no right to place this
burden on the cost of transportation to you
without a clear mandate from a public tri
bunal speaking for you.
The railroads have proposed the settle
ment of this controversy either under the
existing national arbitration law, or by refer
ence to the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. This offer has been refused by the
employes' representatives.
Shall a nation-wide strike or an
investigation under the Gov
ernment determine this issue?
