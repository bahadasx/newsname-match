Jasper News Thursday On the first
page was a little htory about two sticks
long telling how Dr Dimond nn im
petuous young dentist of Iamar
stabbed his sweetheart and then made
a half hearted attempt as the writer
expressed it to cut lite own throat Of
course the boys jollied Dock about it a
good deal but the man who sweat
blood over that wild iniss of names
was our friend Drake editor of the

of his choire fr each uliice in the
county In this cuiuiection I de
sire to call your attention to the
office of Asesor of the County
for which I am a candidate This
is qne of the most impoitant offices
to the taxpayer to be tilled since
his propertj assessments especial
ly on teal estate are largely fixed
by the incumbent of this office
The office should therefore be
held by a person who is familiar
with real estate values in this Coun
ty and wao knows the value of
such properties My twenty years
experience in the real estate busi
ness in Jasper County gives me this
knowledge and if nominated and
elected I can bring to the office
and the taxpayers the berjefitof
such knowledge If I am success
ful in the Primary and then elect
ed in the Full it shall be my high
est endeavor to give you a good
traighTBusiness administration of
the office I invite the voters who
do not know me personally to in
vestigate my standing in this com
munity and in this County where
I am largely known and especial
ly invite such investigation among
my clients and persons who have
had business dealings through my
real estate office and as well among
business men of the County I as
sure you that I shall appreciate
your support in the Primary and
if nominated I feel confident of
winning in the election this Fall
lhankmg you in advance for

TANGNER FOR SHERIFF
Carthage Mans Open Letter to
the Republican Voters
To the Republicans of Japer
county
Having been your nominee foi
sheriff in 1912 when our wholt
ticket whs defeated owing to strife
within -our party I am again 0
candidate for ihe uominati n As
I recollect it 1 leu the local ticket
in t y 1 2 but every man knows there
was no Ilianie furnnv f u thai
yeir This venr when we are
reunited and ired with the deter
mination to win 1 very much want
to make the race again
It has been customary in our
politics to give a man a second
nomination if his first was satis
tactory It seems to me if you
think I made a good race fout
years ago that under the same ruh
I ought to have the nomination
now
If you think the race I made in
191 3 entitles me to any consider
ation at the hands of our party this
year then I ak that you speak to
your friends about my randidac
and thereby help me get the nom
ination If nominated I will im
mediately commence a hard clean
fight and I eel no doubt that I
can win in November
I thank all Republicans for my
foimer nomination and sincerely
hope I may be deemed worthy to
receive it again
Yours Sincerely

THE CIRCUIT JUDGESHIP
John W Halliburton Makes a
Statement to Democratic
Voters
To the Democrat if Voters of Jas
per County Missouri
I find that I am only able to see
a small per cent of the voters in
canvass i r the nomination for
LCwcuit Judge So I take this wiy
of saying to all Democrats that 1
desire and would appreciate your
support tor the nomination I am
a native Missourian and a life long
Democrat I have been in the
active practke ot law tor 47 years
39 years of which time I have been
in Jasper County and in that time
I have had a large and varied ex
perience as a lawyer I have
reached the age where I do not
enjoy the work of the trial lawyer
and my ambition is to retire Irom
business with one term on the
circuit bench
I have acted as special judge in
a very large number and variety
of cases and have held pans of
several terms of couit when the
judge was sick or absent While
but few appeals have been taken
rum my decisions all were af
firmed by the appellate court and
every judgemnt I entered stands
today As to my ability to fill
the position satisfactorily those
vho do not know me are referred
to the practicing lawyers of the
county an i judges of tne courts
My opponent Judge Perkins
aid I hive been mends for over
30 ye irs He is a good man and
1 g tod judge He has been nomi
n tted bv the Democrats of this
county for the position of circuit
judge five times and three of those
umes he was elected serving in all
14 years Each time 1 suppoited
him both for the nomination and
e action Not only have I sup
ported him but for 30 years in
substantially every campaign I
have at my own expense in city
county and congressional district
canvassed the community and
fought the party battles subscrib
ing to the party campaign fundi
according to my means True
Judge Perkins has been a loyal
Democrat but tin Democratic
party has dealt gent rously with
him Under the circumstances I
do not feel that I am asking too
much when I ask the Democratic
voters to support me for the nom
ination for circuit judge
The law prohibits a candidate
from hiring any ne to work for
his nomination or election making
it bribery to do so A candidate
cinnot nominate himself so I will
have to depend on my friends to
look after ray interest at the Pri
mary on August t
Respectfully soliciting your sup
port for the nomination with a
conviction that the Democracy
will be sucresful in the nation
S ate and county I remain as in
past a faithful servitor of your
tarty
