a e^imon delivered by a militaiy chap
the emperor and a congre
\gation of soldiers fresh in mind, the
Associated Press correspondent re
~tarne^ today from the immediate front
^here-tiie great Allies' offensive again
^flickered up in a series of desperate
VvB^I$di
attacks on the German line?
aoftft^es.t of Peronne.

Attacks Barely Moved.
"Hvese baref^ moved, although the
Bntish attacked in force with eleven
divisions, including two absolutely
fresh ones, on the comparitiyely nar
row front between Guillemont and
TKiepval.
French Share Small.
TheFrench share of the offensivce
was limited to a couple of vicious stabs
of merely local extent near Estrees,
southwest of Peronne, which were eas
ily repulsed.
Se Advance Ended.
The present line, extending from
Thiepval to Soyecourt, but bulging
eastward toward Peronne, may be r3
garded, according to the 1km convic
tion of the local staff, the nigh water,
mark of the ehtente jsav&nce
Can Allies Hold?
They base this judgment on the neg
ligible result of the lighting in the last
fortnight, and they contend that it is
no longer a question of whether the
British and French will be able to ex
tend their gains, but whether they will
be able to hold what they have gained
against the German counter pressure.
Deferred By Weather.
The correspondent returned to the
front with the expectation of witness
ing a manifestation of this counter
preasure against a certain sector, but
unfavorable weather conditions, wi*t
low hanging clouds and mist hiding
the operations and preventing artillery
observation, deferred the new struggle
for the coveted stretches of fertile
Picardy.
Quiet Before Storm.
General quiet before the storm pre
vailed along the section of the front,

iijg scarcely greater than the normal
scale where no particular operations
are in progress, and infaitry and raa

TROOPS EAGER FOR FRAY
The -troops visited—the regiments
coming directly from the trenches, a*
well as those about to move into the
forward lines—were found ready, even
•eager to renew, the struggle.
The gaps in the units have been fill
ed up with fresh men the worn-out
cannon—for guns as well as .men reach
the limit of endurance in a prolonged
^artillery battle—have been replaced
with reserve stocks.
Ifunition supplies have been replen
ished, and everything is in readiness
for the new phase of the operations.
Service is Imperative.
Coming- to an interlude in this per

Ike tqle tf the sermon by the em

But afleir 'the singing of the stir

the sermon.
Washington, July 25. (Special)-
Twelve Northern and Western States
paid 80 per cent of the corporation
and income taxes collected under Dem
ocratic legislation by the Federal
Treasury for the fiscal year 1916.
Twelve Southern States paid 7 per
cent of those taxes. Giving an aver
age of five to a family, each head of
a family in these Northern and West
ern states contributed $11.40 of this
tax for the year, while each head of a
f&vuly in the Southern States paid
fyit $1.98. Is it any wonder that a
Congress and an Administration con
trolled by the South favor internal
taxation. The South requires of the
North aDdWest thSit they pay 80 per
cent of tAt cost running the gov
ernment, bu% protection to American
industries and%American labor, by far
the larger wrprf which is located in

sections.
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvan

Rhode Island, ana^Miasouri, have a
population totaling kboui. 44,000,000
in corporation and income taxes ..
ing the fiscal year, 1916.
of New York alone, with
over 9,000,000 people, paid over $45,
000,000 of the tax, a per capita of $5,
or a tax to be met by the head of each
family averaging $25.00 annually.
Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia
and West Virginia have a population
totaling about 22,500,000. These
States paid $8,881^000 in corporation
and income taxes for the fiscal year
1916, or just about twice the amount
paid by the little state of New Jersey,
This is but a synopsis of the first
chapter. A bill has just passed tfie
house which doubles the income taxes,
puts a tax averaging 5 per cent on the
gross receipts of factories making ex
plosives, firearms, and manufacturers
of copper, and places additional taxa
tion on bankers, brokers, ship-brokers
and custom house brokers. Of course
the great bulk of these taxes will be
paid by the Northern and Western
States, where the greater part of these
subjects of taxation are located.
With the South in absolute control
of the administration and Congress,
these Western and Northern states
have no effective voice in deciding the
purposes to which the money raised
by these taxes shall be devoted. Hence
we find Southern Representatives jam
ming through Congress sucK measures
as the $$45,000,000 appropriation to
reclaim swamp lands, under the gunse
of Mississippi flood control funds, the
$20,000,000 appropriation for a nitrate
plant to be located in the South, and
millions of dollars appropriated from
the public till to "irrigate" river beds
located in Southern states.
It has been demonstrated that the
Southern idea of a tariff-for-revenue

With the Republican party in power,
and a protective tariff law in force,
the industries of the entire country
will be fostered, internal taxation will
be lessened, and if the foiviga com

will have to subscribe to the expense
of running the government. Those
who are for "America Fi.-st", will
support the Republican policy.
Washington, July 26.—The Republi
can Publicity Association, through its
President, Hon. Jonathan Bourne, Jr.,
today gave out the following state
ment at its Washington headquarters:
"There is one respect in which we
can agree with the Democrats regard
ing the Republican tariff law—it is a
discriminating tariff though not in 'he
sense that Democrats would have us
believe.
"A protective tariff law discrimi
nates in favor of fixe American pro
ducer, and against the product of the
cheap labor of Europe and Asia.
"Republicans believe in protecting
the American farmer and stock grower
against the competition of farmers
and stockmen who operate on the
cheap lands of Argentina. We believe
in protecting the poultrymen of the
Pacific Coast from competition with
the cheap eggs of China. We believe
in shutting out the butter and cheese
of Canada and Switzerland and nu
merous other countries in order tj
build up better dairy herds in Amer
ica. We believe in building up home
factories in order that' employes of
those factories may havcu^i^^riggin
ploymeiit 'ttl WRU10e1t4tfIve wages and
consequently buy and consume freely
the products of farm and range and

visors was further fedded to by -e
quiring such supervisors to report the
number of bushels of teach grade re
ceived in and shipped out of such ter
minal elevators cadt^-month of the
year. This will be of great value to
the grain growers in determining
whether or not they are receiving the
weights and grades they are entitled
to.
The Senate amendments put teeth
into the mouth of the proposed law
and extended its effect and scope far
beyond the House Bill. The culmin
ation of Senator McCumber's efforts
for the past dozen years for a fede
grain grading and inspection law is
a considerable extent realized.
Senator in an interview today said:'
"While the provisions of the bill as
passed are far short of what I wished
for, still with the amendments we se
cured in the Senate, and especially by
making supervision by Federal au
thority certain aid positive, and by
placing al lof thse exchanges under
Federal supervision, we should elimin
aee most of the abuses that have here
tofore existed in the grain trade. I
am certain, however, that all I have
contended for will be enacted into law
in a short time. The standardization
and supervision are two essential
steps. Complete inspection by Feder
al authority is necessary to make the
law perfect.
"The amendment which provide*
that inspector's license shall not be
given to one who is in the employ of a
person who is directly interested in
the grain inspected goes a long way
toward divorcing the inspection ser
vice from the purchasing and selling
interest. The next step is to make
such inspector a nemploy of the Gov
ernment and place him beyond the
control or influenoe of the board, TO
the end that absolute confidence may
be reposed in the certificates issued
for any cargo of jgrain inspected."
Under the provisions of the bill the
inspectors will continue, as at present,
to be employed by the staets or Boards
of trade. But with stadards of grades
fixed by the Government and Govern
mental supervision of inspectors, cou
pled with hte report showing the
amount and grades of all grain re
ceived and disposed of by each ter
minal elevator, the manipulation of
grades will be almost impossible and
the opposition to complete Federal in
spection and grading will soon disap
pear.
Washington, July 26.—(Special).—
The production of lignite in North Da
kota in 1915, according to the United
States Geological Survey, amounted to
528,078 tons, an increase of 21,393
tons, or 4 per cent, as compared with
1914. The output of 1915 was valued
at $766,072. Practically al the lignite
mined in North Dakota is used within
the State and nearly half of it is con
sumed at the place of production, not
even being loaded on railroad cars.
The increase in population is followed
by greater use of coal, and although
lignite, except in the remoter districts
is not largely used for domestic fuel,

All the resolutions were passed un
animously, after a free and open dis
cussion. The committee on resolu
tions endorsed Hughes for president,
and the National Republican platform,
and also endorsed the State and coun
ty tickets of the Republican party.
The committee also endorsed a cut in
the interest rate to eight per cent, thut
the rate on foreclosures should not ex
ceed the contract rate, that usury be
made a misdemeanor, that it was in
fa vox of the terminal elevator law,
'and that it favored the enforcement
of the prohibitory law. It is the in
tention to call 'the executive commit
tee together the latter part of this
month or the first part of August and
arrange for the coming fall election.
Every candidate on the Republican
ticket from top to bottom will be sup
ported, and the committee hopes to
elect them all.

Washington, July 25.—Yeilding to
an urgent request form President Wi'
son, Democrats of the Senate, in ca
cus tonight, determined to pass th»
child labor bill at this session of Con
gress.
The decision was reached after a
long debate, during which several
Southern senators, whose opposition
forced the measure out of the impera
tive legislature program drawn up
several days ago, vigorously objected
to its reinstatement.
Displaces Ship Bill.
The final determination to include it
was reached without a record vote. It
will displace the shipping bill on th?
Senate calendar, coming up as soon as
the Army and District of Columbia ap
propriations have been passed. Th
shipping measure will follow it in or

Kern Urges Passage.
Majority Leader Kern outlined tc
the caucus the President's earnest re
quest for a vote on the child labor
bill before adjournment, and read a
flood of telegrams from influential
citizens throughout the country, urg
ing its passage.
Southern Senators replied, iosisting
that the caucus should stand on its
former decision postponing consider
tion of the measure until December.
Southerners Battle
They made an appeal to the caucus
for a declaration of principles that the
child labor bill should be taken out of
politics and revealed the fact that ne
gotiations had been made with some
of the republican senators after tho
recent Democratic caucus with a vie
to reaching an agreement for taking
up the bill next session as a strictly
non-partisan measure.
Say Wilson Spoiled It.
These plans, it was asserted in ths
caucus, were progressing favorably
Until President Wilson went to the
Capitol a week ago and made known
to administration leaders his empha

Republican senators, who kad
agreed to let the bill go over, then

Argues Against Delay.
One Southern senator told his col
leagues in the caucus that Federal
child labor legislation was inevitable,
that no vote of theirs could stop it
