f
had a negro wedding in which Willie
? Bitter was the winsome bride and *
Herbert Kearse was groom were k
made one by the officiating parson, *

Others who cannot go unmentioned 1
are Mrs. Ollie Chitty, as "Old Aunt
L Hannah," Miss Sadie Breeland as a 1
washerwoman and her bad boy, Pete, *
little Merrel Johns. More is the pity ^
that we haven't time to mention 1
L each, for, individually, each was ?
K worthy of mention.

ENGLAND'S MANUFACTURES. c
1(
rnmense Increase Even in Time of ^
War. f
?? i
In spite of the five or six million o
len in her army and navy, and the t
uge numbers employed in such non- \
roductive war effort as the censor- t
hip and clerical work in various gov- c
riknent departments, the increase of 1
Inland's manufactures, if munitions a
re included, is enormous, declares c
he Engineering Record. 'What this r
lcrease is, it is impossible?in the s
bsence of any figures of the output
f munitions, ships, etc.?to make
ven an approximate estimate. Judgig,
however, from the fact that the *
ountry's exports nave oeen tairiy
'ell maintained as compared with
913, and have even increased from
lonth to month since the first sharp s
rop following the outbreak of the J
rar, it must be very great, possibly *
s much as 50 or 75 per cent. Part
f this increase, of course, is due to z
auses which will cease to operate t
fter the war?volunteer workers, I
uspension of trade union rules for
estriction of output and sheer in- t
rease of nervous effort?but the
luch greater part is due to improved
rganization and heightened efficien- T
y. It seems reasonable to believe, s
herefore, that any losses of men
rhich England may suffer?the total T
or dead, hopelessly maimed, blind- *
d, etc., is probably not greatly in r
xcess of 200,000 so far (May, 1916) 3
?will be offset by the general 1

"WE-ALL."
Mticism Answered by a Southern
Writer.
Criticism are easy enough to make,
ays Southern Woman's Magazine for
fuly, but not all of them are as easy
o answer as the one recently received
by the Southern Woman's Magaine,
taking Helen Topping Miller to
ask for letting old Aunt Tillie of the
>rize story, "Look Away," use the
expression "we-all." The critic con
ends that no Southern darkey uses
'we-all" or "you-all."
In answer to this Mrs. Miller has
written a convincing letter. She
-ays:
"I have a dear old black mammy
vho boasts that she was raised in the
plackest patch in Alabama, and she is
ny authority for the expression 'well.'
Indeed, her conversation chiefy
consists of expressions like, 'Miss
ielen, we-all ain't got no ice,' 'Weill
better git some mo' coffee.' She
pronounces it like one word, with a
tative accent on the 'all.' Since reviving
this criticism I have heard
hree other darkies use the same expression.
As for 'you-all,' it seems 1
o me that all darkies use it. I have
leard hundreds I know. I cannot
magine in what part of the South '
hese critics have been living."
I
Codes are most extensively used in
elegraphing in China than in any
>ther nation, because Chinese sounds
:annot be represented by Roman leters.

FLOOD WATERS RECEDE
BRIDGE OVER WATEREE LAST
TO GO DOWN.
Sreat, Damage Wrought to Railways.
Service Tliroughout the {State
Crippled.
Columbia, July 20.?The Southern
railway trestle across the Wateree
river, at Kingville, was the latest victim
of the flood waters now pouring
into the streams in the southern section
of the State. The trestle' went
3ut yesterday afternoon and carried
down with it several heavy cars of
material which had been run out on
v
the trestle in an effort to keep it
weighted down. The Coast Line trestle
just a little north of the Southern,
over the Wateree, went out yesterday
morning and all traffic to the PeeDee
section of the State has been
blocked.
Plans for rebuilding the trestles
and repairing the tracks of the railroads
washed away in the storm and
flood are going forward without delay.
The Seaboard has a big repair
gang at work on the trestle near
Camden, and hopes to reopen their
line to the North in a few days. The
Southern has repair gangs- at the
trestle above Rock Hill and at the
trestle near Belmont on the main
line. It is planned to reopen the
main line first and this, it is believed,
will be done in the next few days.
The Seaboard is also at work on
their trestle at Catawba Junction,
while the Coast Line is wasting no
time in making the repairs to their
trestles and track. The Southern officials
believe they will be able to reopen
communication with Spartanburg
in the next day or two. It. appears
that the trestle over the Broad
river, at Shelton, came through with
out narm. >
Temporary Bridge Over Catawba,
Rock Hill, July 22.?A large force
of workmen is building a temporary
trestle across the Catawba at Carhartt.
The space to be spanned is
luite long, and it will be 'some time
before trains can cross.
There is no official observer at this
bridge, but at Catawba station, about
ten miles below, where the Charleston
division's line crosses, and where
the trestle was also lost, J. C. Faris
has for 6iany years kept the record.
His figures for the crest of the flood,
which occurred Monday evening at
7:45 o'clock, is 40.4 feet. He also
reports that at Culp's island; three,
miles below, a negro man was drown- j
ed while trying to capture a bale of i
cotton which had come down from
above.
While not having a famine by any
means, Rock Hill citizens have had
to be very economical in their use of
water for the past week.. The rise
of the river put the pumping station
out of commission until Wednesday,
and then the intake pipe became
clogged with the unusual amount of
mud and necessitated the laying of
a temporary intake. This is now
completed, and is furnishing water
at the rate of 600 gallons per^minute,
which will altogether relieve the situation
until the regular?pipe can be
cleared.
The total damage caused' by the
flood in this section cannot now be
estimated-f but it will be enormous.
Big Coast Line Trestle Goes.
Columbia, July 19.?The flood
sweeping down-State in the Wateree
river carried away the Atlantic Coast
Line trestle at Eastover this morning,
cutting off the remaining line
of communication between Columbia
and the North. Efforts to save the
trestle-were unsuccessful. Coal cars
loaded with sand and other heavy
ballast were run out on the trestle
in an effort to keep it from giving
wav. but the mighty waters, using
the debris of wrecked trestles and
driftwood from up-State, hurled the
mighty structure from its ifioorings
and it went down, adding its total to
the toll already exacted in fearful
amount by the angry waters.
Following the washing out of the
long Seaboard Air Line trestle across
the Wateree at Camden yesterday
came the destruction of the county
bridge across the river just a short
distance below the railroad trestle.
This structure surrendered to the
tide last night just before midnight,
and the impression here is that it
was the heavy battering force of the
Seaboard trestle and the county
bridge at Camden which finally
brought victory for the waters of the
Wateree over the Atlantic Coast Line
trestle at Wateree, just below Eastover.

KILLING OF COL. BUTLER.
Hotel Man Who Killed His Wife and
Officer Refuses to Talk.
Alpine, Texas, July 21.?Mystery
surrounds the motive of Harry J.
Spannell, manager of a local hotel,
for shooting and killing his wife and
Lieut. Col. M. C. Butler, of the 6th
United States cavalry, while the three
were motoring yesterday evening.
According to an announcement ?
from the county attorney tonight,
Spannell, wh? surrendered himself 1 **
immediately after the shooting, v&-.
fused to discuss his case and a thorough
investigation disclosed no ap
parent reason tor tne Killing.
The shooting caused much excitement
because of the prominence of
the Spannell family and of Col. Butler.
Spannell, who was held overnight
in the county jail, was taken
today to another town, the name of
which was not revealed, for safe- .
keeping. xAn
investigation by local authori- }'
ties disclosed that Spannell was driving
his wife and Col. Butler in his
car along the main residential street
of the town when suddenly he stopped
his engine, turned in his seat,
drew an automatic pistol and a revolver,
and with the one began \
shooting Col. Butler and with the
other his wife.
He calmly emptied both firearms
into tte bodies of the victims, according
to witnesses, and then without
haste walked to the court house
~?i- o.
and gave himself up.
Apparently Col. Butler was shot
first and killed instantly, for persons
nearby heard the woman cry out after
the shooting had begun, "Harry,
don't kill me!" while the officer made
nr? rm t r>rv
AAV V va. VV* J aPrevious
to the shooting, Spannell
had been chatting gaily with friends
at the Holland hotel, of which he^w^fe v
manager.
Col. Butler only recently was promoted
from the rank of major and
had been stationed here in command
of the garrison for about two months
and had become popular with the ' 1
townspeople. He lived at the Hoiland
hotel and he and his wife and
nine-year-old son were on intimate
terms socially with Mr. and Mrs.
Mrs. Spannell and their five-year-old .
daughter. ' _
Before being taken away from the
lbcal jail, Spannell broke down and
sobbed bitterly, bemoaning what he
termed his "madness.'" He persisted,
however, in his refusal to discuss
his reasons for the shooting.
Spannell, who is thirty years old,
is a native of Hazellton, Pa., where *
his parents still live. A graduate of \
musical conservatories in this coun^
try and abroad, he was an instructor
in music at Baylor University, at ;Waco,
Texas, when he met the
daughter of John R. Holland, a cattleman
and banker, of Alpine, whom
he later married. Mrs. Spannell was
i
then a student in the university. She
; was twenty-nine years old and was
'
known as one of the most beautiful
[ women in Texas. * -3
Col. Butler was fifty-two years old
! and a native of Edgefield, S. C. He
was a son of Major Gen. Mathew C.
..
j Butler, U. S. A., who was also a
major general in the * Confederate t'
army and for a number of years was
a United States senator from South
Carolina.
Col. Butler's body was sent to
Washington today to be buried in
Arlington National cemetery.
SCHOOL SAVINGS BANK.
?
Important School Movement Now Under
Way.
Do we Americans truly realize the
magnitude of this endeavor? asks
Carl Holliday, in the American Re
view of -Reviews. Today there are
over $1,300,000 in these savings
banks created by the school teachers,
|and more than 217,000 children are
depositors. Founded in 1873 by a
Belgian teacher, Professor Laurent,
of Ghent, the school banking system
was first inaugurated in America at
[ Long Island City by another Belgian,
John H. Thirty, and today from
Maine to California the youngsters
are depositing their penhies and "jitneys."
Generally the school keeps
the child's money until the sum of
$3 is reached, and then deposits in
the youngster's name in a bank paying
at least 3 per cent. The amounts
deposited in the cities since the begining
of the system have, of course,

and $250,000 in Toledo?but in
towns like Helena and Great Falls,
Montana, and Chester, Pennsylvania,
the savings of children also show
astounding growth.
