Reed Amendment Giving Priv

Knocked Out.
POINT RAISED BY WILLIAMS
Matter of Much Politioal Mo
ment May Henew Charges
of Politics.
Solictors on the border will not
be allowed to vote in the coming
election after all, so far as any
Federal legislation is concerned.
The Reed amendment, adopted
in the Senate yesterday as a part
ef the army bill, was knocked but
today.
Senator Jones of Washington
brought the matter up today and
ought to get an amendment adopt
ed which would waive the require
ment of registration.
WILLIAM SINTERFERES.
Thereupon Benator John Sharp Wli
llama objected and said If thts were
Insisted on ha would ratae a point or
order against the whole Heed amend
ment. He ralaed the point, the chair sus
tained htm and on appeal by Senator
Heed the chair waa upheld.
The matter la one or much political
moment, it la clear that ir the guard
is kept on the border without other
than patrol duty to perfom until after
lectlqn there will be aharp opposition.
Benator Works remarks In the Benate
yesterday alleging the troops were on
the border fo political reasons are likely
to be a forerunner ot many .such
charges.
Two hundred thousand magaslne rifles
will be added to the supply of the army
this fiscal year, and will be manufactur
ed tn the Government arsenals at Rosk
Island, 111., and Springfield, Mass.
This will result from action of the
Senate In restoring to $5,000,000 the
amount allowed for manufacture of
small arms In the army bill.
The House fixed the sum at 13,000,000.
but the Senate Military Committee cut
It In two.
The effect of the Senate action will be
to start the small arms plants at Rock
Islandw and Springfield arsenals work
ing to full capacity. Rock Island will
make 250 rifles per day and Springfield
will make 500.
Senator La, Follette today renewed the
tight to get pay allowed for the depen
dent families of guardsmen.
He moved to suspend the rules and
allow $2,000,000 for the purpose. He
spoke at length In support of It. and
served notice on 8enators that If they
did not listen to what he had to say
he would call them back.
2 Lose Lives When
BoatGoes Over Dam
Police Grapple for Bodies in the
Schuylkill Whirlpool Four
Rescued Alive.
PHILADELPHIA, July 27. Police axe
grappling today for the bodies of two
men beneath the whirlpool of the
BchuylklU river dam hare, who lost their
Uvea when their launch waa washed
over the waterfall, four other men
were rescued with dirnculty.
The six men were about to start for a
trip up the river late last night. The
Schuylkill is considerably swollen by
recent rains and an unusually strong
current plunged over the dam. When
directly in the middle of the stream
something went wrong with the launch's
steering gear. Hundreds of persons
stood on the banks watching the little
craft being carried toward the high dam
while the occupants shouted for help.
As the boat tilted over the wall four
of the men leaped and this probably
saved their Uvea, though they, too, were
carried over, ine boat was splintered.

PLAGUE'CURES'
Department of Agriculture
Launches Vigorous Cam
paign Against Dealers.
SAYS PUBLIC IS PREYED ON
The Department of Agriculture
has launched a campaign against
"cures" and "remedies" for in
fantile paralysis.
Whenever an epidemic breaks
out, say officials charged with en
forcement of the pure food and
drug act, "unscrupulous dealers
prey upon the fear or ignorance of
the public bv concoctions for
which they assert curative prop
erties, which have no foundation
in fact."
A bulletin from these officials
warns the public that any prepara
tion offered for sale as being ef
fective for the treatment of in
fantile paralysis should be regard
ed with extreme suspicion.
TEXT OF BULLETIN.
The statement says:
"The department will do everything It
can under Federal law to protect that
portion of the public which Is ex
tremely credulous in times of panto and
which will grasp at anything which
promises protection or relief. The sale
of such products at this time, the offi
cials point out. Is particularly threaten
ing' to the public health because many
persons, relying on the false state
ments of Impostors, neglect to secure
competent medical service. As a result
not only Is the safety of the patient en
dangered, but in the absence of proper
sanitary precautions, the likelihood of
contagion is greatly increased.
Are Powerless In the States.
,'1t must be understood, however, that
therderarfood and drugs act applies
only to products which are shipped
In' Interstate commerce; that Is, from
one State to another, or which are of
fered for import or export, or which
are manufactured or sold within a Ter
ritory or the District of Columbia.
Products which are made and con
sumed wholly within a single State
are sublect only to such State laws
as may apply and are under the con
trol only of State health officials. The
Federal law does not apply, for In
stance, to patent medicines made with
in the State of New York and sold In
New York city. Persons buying or
using a 'remedy- made In their own
State, therefore, must rely on the pro
tecUon accorded them by their local
health authorities."
SLIGHT DECREASE IN
PLAGUE IN NEW YORK
Total of Gases Reported Reaches
3,411 in Greater City.
NEW YORK. July IT. A slight de
crease In Infantile paralysis cases waa
reported in Greater New York today,
but the additional sufferers ISO
brought the total up to 3,411 since the
killing plague started, six weeks ago.
Deaths today numbered thirty-one,
against thirty-five yesterday, making a
total of 713 homes where the disease
has proved fatal.
Experts battling the Infantile paraly

has been made toward discovery of a
successful weapon to fight the disease.
Dr. E. J. Bermlngham, surgeon at the
New York Throat. Nose, and Lung
Hospital, announced his preliminary re
port on a study of prevention and cure
of the disease. He s&td Dr. 8. J.

Brooklyn continued the worst plague
spot. Ninety cases were reported today
against eight-three yesterday. Health
officials are puzzled because the situa
tion In the Bronx with its hundreds of
thousands of babies almost as many
as are in Brooklyn continues to im
prove, while Brooklyn conditions grow
worse.
Health officials today Issued a warn
ing against quack remedies. They have
received thousands of letters suggesting

Only Four Plague Cases
On Capital Record Now
Only four cases of Infantile paralysis
wore on rccora at tne Health Depart
ment today. The remaining three cases
have been discharged as cured.
Officials of the department said that
while there were slight evidences of
paralysis remaining, there Is hope for
the complete recovery of all of the
patients.
Under the District regulations patients
suffering from Infantile paralysis are
released from quarantine after the tem
perature has been normal for two
weeks.
The health authorities are much en
couraged over the situation tn the Dis

FOR AVIATORS
War Department Plans Big
. Plant and Proving Ground
For,All Army Work.
GOVERNMENT TO BUY LAND
Appropriation of $200,000 Is
Asked to Start .Work onOld
, Aviation Field.
Even should Baltimore or some
other city succeed in wresting the
proposed naval laboratory from
Washington, the National Capital
will still have the distinction of
being the center for aeronauts.
Announcement has been made
by the War Department that a
"proving grounds" Dor aviation in
the United States army will be
established at College Park.
Those who profess to know the
department's plans say the "prov
ing grounds" project will be as
large and important as the naval
laboratory.
$200,000 IS ASKED.
An appropriation of $200,000 to pro
vide for the "prorlngigrounds" is car
ried in an amendment' to the army bill
offered by Senator Smith of Maryland
yesterday. This appropriation Is en
tirely for the purchase of land. Other
appropriations for the construction of
buildings will follow. It is said.
It Is the plan of (Secretary Baksr to
make College Park to the army what
Handy Hook and Indian Head are to the
navy, a place where aviation Inventions
may be tried out and perfected before
being adopted by the army.
Eventually it Is planned to construct
laboratories at College Park for ad
vancement or aviation.
"if a new aeroplane la invented it will
be tried out at College Park." a signal
corps officer explained today, "it a
new gun for an aeroplane la perfected It
will be given Its flrst testa there, or a
new bomb to be dropped from aero
planes In aerial warfare, tl Is the plan
to conduct all experimental work at the
proposed proving ground.
Serious Handicap.
Lack of facilities for testing out aero
planes and aerial inventions has proved
a serioua handicap.
For Instance. It has been necessary,
for lack of such facilities to send pow
erful new aeroplanes to the border to
be assembled there for the Mexican
campaign, only to find that propellor
trouble developed that made the ma
chines practically worthless. If the

Washington High School boys have It
all over the Secretary of War and the
Assistant Secretary of the Navy when
it comes to knowledge about the proper
way to shoot a gun. These two offi
cials have learned by practical demon
stration that while they are running
the two departments that do the most
shooUng, the high school students of
Washington can teach them things
about their own business.
In fact, the high school bom of
Washington did teach these two offi

school boys and not marines or Bailors
who acted aa Instructors for the party

Superintendent of Police: Lincoln
Steftens, Herbert Quick, and others.
When the party arrived on the range,
after taking preliminary Instruction
from Gunnery Sergeant Hale, of the
marines, on the navy yacht Sylph en
route to Wlnthrop, they were turned
over to a squad of high school youths
to be taught the actual pocesses of
shooting. The officials were much
pleased with their instructors and con
gratulated them on their proficiency.

Up From Carolina to Dela
ware Breakwater.
The British admtrali commanding
the gquadren ,bT the Atlantic
coast denies that a British war
ship entered Chesapeake Bay,
aa reported to the Nary De
partment yesterday, British
Ambassador Spring-Rice told
Acting Secretary of State Polk
today.
NORFOLK, Va., Jufy 27. Five
American warships and several
aeroplanes are guarding the Vir
ginia Capes against invasion by
British and French warships stand
ing off shore awaiting the coming
of the German submarine Deutsch
land from Baltimore.
The American ships are the
cruiser North Carolina and the
torpedo boat destroyers Beale,
Flusser, Reid, and Sterret.
They are lined up along the
coast from Beaufort, N. C, almost
to Delaware Breakwater.
The North Carolina is standing
about ten miles off the capes, and
close by are two foreign warships,
presumably British.
One of them, a three-funneled
vessel, is believed to be the cruis
er Cumberland, the ship that is
reported to have entered the Vir
ginia Capes behind the battleship
Louisiana Monday night.
MANEUVERS HELD.
The North Carolina and destroyers
engaged in maneuvers today, the cruis
er launching two aeroplanes which
circled around the foreign ships, and
well out to sea.
The sending of the North Carolina
and destroyers to sea was aa much for
the purpose of holding aeroplane ma
neuvers as to enforce neutrality laws.
The maneuvers were to have been
held off Newport with the Atlantic
fleet, but with no other ships here to
see that the submarine Deutschland gets
& safe passage to sea, the North Caro
lina and the destroyers were assigned
to that duty.
These ships will keep foreign war
ships outside the three-mile limit while
the Deutschland Is clearing the cape.
The submarine, however, well en
counter a formidable fleet of enemy
ships after she gets out to sea. Ten
French and British ships are reportod
to be awaiting her all along the coast
from Hatteras to Cape Henry.
Only tour Qf these ships have been
seen from the shore. One has four fun
nels, two have' three funnels, and, a
converted cruiser, has two funnels.
Their names have been obscured by,
paint, but two ot them have been Iden
tified as the Cumberland and Berwlnd.
When the Deutschland leaves the'eapes
American warships will prevent her be
ing followed by private craft, several of
which have been chartered for that
purpose.
BRITISH SHIP READY

Spy Steamer Prepares to Trail
Vessel Down Bay.
BALTTMOBEX July 2T. When the
German subsea freighter Deutsch
land skims down the Patapsco for
the canes, en route home, a big Brit
ish tramp steamer, the Ardgryfo, Is
due to follow her as a spy ship.
An offlcor of the watch boat ad
mitted to tho United Press today
that "we plan to go out when our
friend over yonder does."
He was reticent about his purposes,
though he admitted he and his Jap
crew are keeping a lookout.
The Deutschland Is still screened
behind her barge protectors. Tho
tug Tlmmlns Is ready to tow her.
Along the river watchers hoped she
would head out soon. A scorching
July sun todav turned the ollv har
bor to a shimmering rainbow and
baked the spy lines,
May Make Run Now.
But. with the vessel cleared, it
seemed to the spies thnt the Deutsch
land must at last plan a run for
home. The story went that aha
would sail before night.
Her chances of safety seemed more
precarious with the allied patrol
growing greater and balder: but per
haps the sister ship Bremen brings
fighting submarine convoys, and
these may be the Deutschland's
guard returning.
The Deutschland's promoters were
Joyous over one point that tho
united States Government seems de
termined that there shall be no
transarresslon of the three-mile limit
I law by the British vessels.
