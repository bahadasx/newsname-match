by the business men of Colum
I bia were awarded to those winning
I firsts, and ribbons to the seconds and
thirds. An audience of about a hun
dred decked the bleachers and did not
time when they can best be taught the
lessons of temperance. When they
reach the high school it is best to
teach temperance in connection with
the hciences. The men who teach can
do much by holding up high stand
ards of temperance. The children
should be taught that the use of
alcohol and tobacco cause flabby mus
cles and a weakened nervous system.
There is no necessity of speaking of
anything so ugly as drunkenness to
small children."
Great stress should be laid on the
principles of health in public schools,
believes Miss Tinling. Health, as she
sees it, means wholeness of body,
wholeness of mind and wholeness of
soul. The use of tobacco, and es
pecially cigarettes, should be dis
couraged. This is hard to do as the
children have the example of school
superintendents, and fathers and
brothers who smoke. The teacher
should make a distinction between
men and boys. If at all, a boy should
not smoke until he is 21, or better yet
25. years, old.
Miss Tinling showed several charts
comparing the food value of beer
against bread, illustrating how the
use of alcohol, even in small quani
ties hinders efficiency and how the
use of tobacco affects heart action and
the brain cells. Another chart show
ed how the scholarship of boys who
did not use tobacco excelled that of
boys who were smokers.
"The use of stories is the most ef
fective way of getting temperance
truths before children," said Miss
Tinling. "Children will listen to and
remember a good story. There are
innumerable sources where these
stories may be obtained. Good litera
ture, the Hible in particular, is full
of them."

WASHINGTON, July 27. The Sen
ate this afternoon passed without a
record ote the $312,000,000 army bill.
1 With one exception the bill is the
larecst military budget ever appropri
ated in time of peace by any nation.
The exception is the $390,000,000 ap
propriation by Russia in 1914-15. The
army bill follows close upon the
largest naval bill, $315,000,000, ever
authorized by any nation. The total
of the two is $627,000,000, the world's
greatest peace time war bill.
Fights are expected in the House
against both.
Among the features of the bill are
enlarged appropriation for United
States military men who are taking
lessons in warfare in the European
trenches and an appropriation for a
council of national defense.
This latter is to consist of six civ
ilians and six army and navy men to
co-operate In preparing and mobiliz
ing the nation for war.
The bill provides $13,381,000
airships.
I-arge increases were required for
higher pay and numerous new priv
ileges for the state militia.
Aid for dependent families of Na
tional Guardsmen and regulars on the
Mexican border, not to exceed $50 a
mouth, was ordered by the Senate as
an amendment to the army appropria
tion bill.

NORFOLK, Va., July 27. Five Unit

trality off the Virginia capes this af

Either Good or Bail News of Bremen
Ke.'ps Di'utsrhland In Port.
I!y United Press.
BALTIMORE. July 27. Either
alarming information or good news of
the submarine Bremen kept the Ger
man wonder boat Deutschland in port
today. Which it was the managers of
the under-sea venture refused to say.
Orders for the vessel to go out over
night suddenly were countermanded.
Inasmuch as news of the Bremen was
a determining factor in the matter of
the Dcutschland's sailing, it was ac
t epted as true that at last the
Deutsehland's sister ship had been
i heard from.
I Porhntw it ivnq s.iirl. the Bremen had
met with mishap and that the Deutsch
land would not make an attempt to
run the Allied blockade.
On the other hand it was suggested j
cheerfully that the Deutschland is !
waiting on the Bremen's landing.
The tug Timmins has extra coal
aboard, prepared cither for a run out
beyond the three-mile limit of the
capes or to run for a time down
Chesapeake Bay.
One theory was that the Deutsch
land had been found defective and
hence could not quit port. But dur
ing this afternoon the Deutschland
submerged, and as far as observers
could learn mis was satisfactory.

LONDON, July 27. Hand-to-hand
encounters with the Germans and an
active artillery pounding continued
throughout the night was reported this
afternoon by General Haig.
No event of importance was re
ported by the British commander-in-chief.
"Throughout the night," he said,
"our artillery was active. We con
tinued to press the enemy in hand-to-hand
combats at various points.
'Elsewhere the enemy is using gas
and tear shells."
Within the next few days the Brit
ish advance lines must withstand
Germany's most powerful attacks
since the start of the Allied offensive.
The newly won positions near Po
ziercs, from which the Teutons were
forced out, will be the point of the
German attack.
'This was the opinion of military ob
servers here this afternoon. They
pointed out that the Germans admit
tedly have transferred large reserve
forces to the Pozieres region, and that
fact made British successes reported
by General Haig more satisfactory, but
it likewise gives cause to military ob
servers here to feel anxious about the
British encircling movement west
from Pozieres and cast from Hill
304.
In their position at Pozieres the
British are only a trifle more than
six miles from Bapaume, the immedi
ate objective of their drive. At last
they have penetrated the third line
of the German front. If they can
gain the six miles to Bapaume, a Ger
man retreat of fifteen or twenty miles
is inevitable.

BERLIN. July 27. The repulse of
a British reconnoitering attack south
west of Warneton and the failure of
a trench attack around Barlcux and

The war office likewise reported
futile Russian attacks, with bloody
enemy losses, around Schitschara.
"A French attack northwest of Bar
lcux failed and attacks at Cold Height
and Fleury were repulsed. Fighting
in these sections continues. Between
the Ancre and the Somme there was
intense artillery fire during the fight.
"West of Pozieres a grenade attack
was repulsed.
"A British reconnoitering attack
southwest of Warneton and near
Richebourg was repulsed," the state
ment said.
