LONDON. July 27.—Within the
next few days the British advanced
lines moat withstand Germany's most
powerful counter attacks since the
start of the allied offensive. The
newly won positions out of Poxieres
from which the Teutons were forced
out, will be the point of attack.
This was the opinion of military
observers here today. They pointed
out that the Germans have admitted
ly transferred large reserve forces lo
this salient from Verdun. Knowledge
of that fact made the Brltssh success
reported yesterday by General Haig
aU the more satiafaftpry, but
It likewise gave notice to military
experts here that the Germans, feel
ing the menace In the British en
circling. movement from Pozleres
westward and eastward from Hill
141 south of Tbiepval, would attempt
its checking with every resource of
men and guns at their command.
"In their positions at Pozieres the
British are only a trlflo over six
miles from Bapaume, the immediate
objective of their drive. At one
point at least they ,have penetrated
the third line of the German front.
If they can press the intervening six
miles to Bapaume German retire
ment along a front of fifteen or
twenty miles is almost Inevitable.
mm Poxieres on to Bapaume the
country is fairly flat wich none of
the ridges whleh dot the territory
just south of Thiepval. except one
knoll known as Hill 161. None of
the ofllclal statements shed any light
on whether this position lying north
west of Pozieres is traversed by the
two strong trenches which Haig re
ported having been stormed and cat
tured. Apparently there was a lull
In the Infantry attacks along the
British front today. Feverish activity
in throwing up entrenchments and
consolidating their gains will be
necessary so that the British can suc
cessfully withstand the German coun
ter attacks and until this digging in
is accomplished, It Is not expected
there will be another forward drive.
Hand te Hand Fighting.
LONDON, July 27.—Hand to hand
encounters with the Germans and an
active artillery pounding continuing
throughout the night, was reporter
today by General Sir Douglas Haig.
He said the Teutons were vsing Quan
tities of tear shells.
"No event of importance,'' was io
ported by the British commander in
chief.
"Throughout the night," he said
"our artillery was active. We con

WASHINGTON, July 27—Revers
ing yesterday's action, the senate to
day struck out of the army Mil a
provision to permit militiamen on the
Mexican border to vote for president,
vice president, senators and congress
men.
Senator Jones of Washington first
attempted to amend yesterday's pro
vision so that failure of a guardsman
to register before he left tor the
border would not necessarily debar
him from voting. Senator Williams
then raised a point of order against
the whole amendment on the ground
it waa general legislation and not
properly a part of an appropriation

the senate sustained the point.
