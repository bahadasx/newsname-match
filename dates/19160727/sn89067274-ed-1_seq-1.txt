HE URGES DAIRY PROMOTION
Saya if Output of Milk Sufficient to
Justify Company Would Estab
lish Plant Her.
"The St Louis Dairy Company
would establish a eondensory in Mex
ico if the supply of milk Justified such
an establishment. We would ask no
bonus of 110,000 but I would suggest
such a fund might be raised for loan
purpose among the farmers who are
entering the dairy b!"" mrA
the promotion of the industry here."
Thus did T. L. White, fleldman of the
St Louis Dairy Co., sum up the local
situation regarding a eondensory.
Mr. White viBited this city Mon
day evening and was the guest of
Ross Martin, of the Rock Spring
Dairy. Mr. Martin is shipping large
quantities of milk and cream to St
Louis each month. When he told Mr.
White of the plan to give $10,000
bonus for the establishment of a eon
densory in this city Mr. White laugh
ed and said if the field justified it
his company would establish such a
piant without a cent from the Mexico
citizens.
Mr. White suggested that a fund of
$10,000 for the purpose of loaning it
to farmers starting in the dairy busi
ness and used for the promotion of the
industry in this section would not be
a bad idea.
The St Louis Dairy Co. have six
eondensory plants. They are used to
care for the surplus milk after the
routes and ice cream industries in St
Louis have been supplied. Mr .White
will be in Mexico again making
further investigation.
GAVE $50,000 TO THE DRYS.
ST PAUL, July 21. The Prohibi
tion National Convention is going to
nominate some one for President to
day, but a little old man from John
ston, Fla., is its hero.
The little old man sat pretty far
back in the convention hall yesterday
and talked to his gray-haired looking
little wife, who shared the honors.
They were Mr. and Mrs. John P. Cof
fin, who own 12,000 acres of land in
Florida, but act and look just like the
rest of "home folks" who are attend
ing the convention.
The Prohibitionists need money to
run the campaign. The chairman had
called for contributions and they were
coming in slowly. A voice back in
the hall said something about $50,
000. "What's that?" the crowd shouted.
Coffin's gray head popped up from
the Florida delegation.
"Yes, that'B what I said," he said,
"Put me down for $50,000."
The convention cheered and dele
gates toppled over their chairs to get
to Coffin. They picked him up and
carried him to the platform. Mrs.
Coffin looked embarrassed, but they
picked her up, too, and carried her up
there with him.
Coffin's gift ia? the largest ever
made for Prohibition campaign. His
pledge started the ball rolling, and
funds came in after that. The collec
tion was just like one of those dona
tion parties they have for country
ministers. Those who didn't have
money gave other things. One man
tossed into the pot a mortgage for
$158.68 on some Illinois law books and
told the collectors to get after the
money.
MOURNING FOR MONEY.
If you are planning to send some
money to Old Mexico, you had better
send it in an envelope with a mourn
ing border upon it, not because your
hopes of its reaching its destination
are dead, but to help it on its way.
The bandetti on the border, and
some of the officers have the habit of
opening letters, especially registered
ones, which are apt to contain money
and appropriating the contents for
their own use. But the Mexicans are
a superstitious people and the sign of
mourning is something sacred to
them. They fear to desecrate it, and
mourning envelopes are passed by and
given the right of way over other
mail.
So if you are going to send money,
real sure enough Uncle Sam money,
into Mexico better play like its dead,
or it may never get where you want
it to, but end its journey by purchas
ing chile or some other form of edi
ble fire so dear to the Mexican .
