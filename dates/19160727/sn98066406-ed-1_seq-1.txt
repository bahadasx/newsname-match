A LARGE CROWD ATTENDS CALEDONIAN DAY
CELEBRATION AND ALL HAVE GOOD TIAIE.
LOTS OF KILTIES PRESENT. SOME
FINE MUSIC AND DANCING ALL DAY.
The weather man wad indeed very
kind to the Scots and their friends last
Tuesday, for he didn't even send th
customary Scotch mist. There was
plenty of (Jerniau dampness, howTver,
and some of the crowd seemed to enjoy
the absence of the one and the pres
euce of the other.
Early In the morning the visitors be
gan to arrive in the city and by noon
Main street was lined with people
and the park was crowded with a good
natured uanch who had come to help
ub celebrate our first Caledonian Day.
As the Expositor has prophesied the
past few weeks, one of the largest
crowds in the history of the city was
present for the occasion.
There was one thing, though, that
made those who were behind the move
remain on the anxious seat for the
entire forenoon and for a short time
id the afternoon. This was the non
arrival of the pipers and dancers. The
feeling that the committee had over
their absence was eased up a lot, too,
by the remarks that were made by
some of the friends (?) of the celebra
tion through the crowd that it was a
fake and there would be no pipers and
dancers. Hut finally they did come,
and with them came the pipers' baud
from Sarnia. This latter aggregation
was bought up through the efforts of
Steve Windsor and I'at Flyun of Tort
Huron, and it was a very agreeable sur
prise all round. Had the pipers and
dancers secured for the occasion failed
to arrive the disapppointment would
have been great, and those in charge
feel grateful to these gentlemen for
their help in making the celebration.
I'at has lots of good friends in Yale
and is always willing to do what he
can to help with any celebration we
might have. Steve's heart is in the
right place and that place is hie old
home town, and when he can serve his
old friends a good turn he is mighty
willing.
The lour Scotch dancers, (jladys
Combers and Marion Stark of London,
and Gladys and Isabell MacUregor
of Saruia and their work was the be6t
that was ever staged in Yale, and the
crowd which was present were more
than repaid lor the time they spent in
coming to Yale for the occasion.
There were many present who had
never seen the Scotch dancing, or heard
the pipers, and there were others who
had heard them hundreds of times, and
both the classes were more than pleased
with the entertainment.
The Lexington band, the best little
musical organization in this section of
the tate, was here, and the people
were well pleased with their rendition
of the latest popular music and the old
favorite Scotch tunes;
The athletic eportp were the bed that
were ever held here and we are pleased
to note that moet of the prizes in the
different events were captured by local
talent. Every event was pulled off
as advertised excepting the tug of war
and the old men's race. Following are

Then came the ball game between
the Yale Boosters and the Sandusky
team. We had expected a close game,
but the contest was too one sided to
create the usual amount of interest
displayed at an exhibition of this pop
ular sport. The boys from Sandusky
were no match for our team at any
time during the day, being out-bat-ted,
oul-tielded and out-played at every
stage of the game. During the entire
seven innings "Little Dutch" only al
lowed them one bit. Ibis was in the
tifth inning and the plum was picked
by Hancock. That Hallman's team
mates gave him elegant support wa
shown by the fact that they uidu'thave
an error chalked up against them.
The visitors had lour. The Yale team
touched Klngbaum, Sandusky's pitcher
for eight good, healthy taps, three of
them home runs (one by Allen and two
by Lutz) The score at the close of
the gam stood 10 to 0, with Yale in
the lead.
The Scotch concert in Central hall
in the evening was largely attended
and all seemed to be well pleased with
the music and the dancing. The only
kick we have heard is that it didn't last
long enough.
Taken as a whole, the celebration
was a grand sucoess in every way, and
it is to be hoped that it will be made an
annual event. Of course there were
some things lacking aud others which
were not strictly up to Hoyle, but the
fact that this was the first at
tempt should be taken into considera
tion, and the mistakes can be rectitied
and a tew changes made which will all
go to make a bigger and better cele
bration tor next year.

About the Celebration.
It is estimated that there were over
3,000 attended the celebration.
Now that the big celebration is over,
let's all get together and boost to make
this year's Chautauqua a good one.
It looks as though everything will be
squared up and a nice little sum will
be left in the treasury for next year.
The management feel very grateful
to the people of Vale and vicinity for
their assistance in making Caledonian
Day the success it was.
It has been suggested that Caledon
ian Dy be pulled off on July 4tb next
year, and try to get everybody to boost
for a big double celebration.
