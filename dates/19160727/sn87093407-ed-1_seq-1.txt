The Seattle Star
» THE ONLY PAPER IN SEATTLE THAT DARES TO PRINT THE NEWS :
VOLUME 19.
FOB SALE: "THIS VALUABLE PIECE
OF BUSINESS PROPERTY"
WH HAVE here, a picture.
It is a picture of water and cat-tails and
mud, etc.
The Star has called it "The Humphrey Duck
pond Postoffice Site."
However, the honorable and reliable morning
paper known as the t\-1., today, in its always
truthful and fair editorial column, says that as a
matter of fact, "it ia a valuable piece of business
property in doae proximity to the railways and
many of Seattle's big institutions."
It is plain that The Star was wrong, as usual,
and that the P.-l. is right, as usual.
We want buyers of valuable business property
to believe us when we say that The Star was
wrong and the P.-l. right, because Uncle Sam, who
paid St6o,Soo for the "valuable piece of business
property," wants to sell it, and The Star, in line
with its plain duty, wants to help Un~le Sam sell it.
With the honorable and reliable P.-I.'s guaran
tee that it is a "valuable piece of business prop
erty," we trust that there will be no question about
it. For amphasb, we repeat IT IS A "VALUABLE
PIECE OF BUSINESS PROPERTY."
Vet Uncle Sam will sell it at a bargain price.
There has been some talk of selling it for about
SSo.ooo, but since the always honest and truthful
morning paper has now added its guarantee to the
property, Uncle Sam may feel like raising the
price somewhat.
We suggest, therefore, that buyers in the market
for pieces of "valuable property in close proximity
to the railways and many of Seattle's big institu
tions" jump right in and grab up this valuable

4 MORE ARRESTS
MADE IN BOMB PLOT
SAN FRANCISCO, July 27.—
Four more suspects In Satur
day's dynamiting outrage were
reported to have been arrested
by the police today In their
work of attempting to fasten
the crime which cost nine lives
upon an organized band of dy
namiters.
Capt. Mathewson, of the spe
cial bomb squsd, refused to dis
close the identity of the sus
pects, but would not affirm or
deny that four had been taken
into custody,
Two of the men hc.ld are declar
ed to he Ed Nolan, a machinist,
and a man named John Federer, or
Fedora. Word of Nolan'n arrest
was received at the headquarters
of the Machinists' union, hut the
officers of the union had no fur
ther information.
The. arrests were made at differ
ent, times and places. One man
was taken Into custody early in the
morning and two later In the day,
Nolan was arrested shortly before
noon.
In addition. Warren Hillings,
taken last night, and He4le bavin,
his landlady, ate held
Such close secrecy has been
maintained regarding the ac
tivity of the special bomb squad

piece.
You really ought to grab it today, before Uncle
Sam has time 10 learn that its value is now guaran
teed by the always truthful and the alwavs re
liable P.-I.
The Star has said that maybe Germany will want
this postoffice site as a submarine station, but The
Star was wrong in that, too, just as it was wrong
in calling it a duck-pond.
We have found out since that the water isn't
deep enough for a submarine station.
In talking of this "valuable piece of business
property" this morning, the honest P.-I. says Hum
phrey had nothing to do with helping Uncle Sam
buy the property. This only goes to show that no
matter how honest and reliable a newspaper may
be. it is liable to make mistakes—honest mistakes.
On August 21, 1011, Humphrey wrote a confi
dential letter and signed his name. The letter was
addressed to a treasury official. Humphrey wrote:
"The price asked for the postoffice site is REA
SONABLE." He wrote further, "I want to see
the matter go forward without delay, at I told you
in our conversation."
liven tho the P.-I. was mistaken, and HONESTLY
MISTAKEN, on this minor detail, the fact that
Humphrey himself said the price of $169,500 is
reasonable only goes to prove that the reliable old
P.-I. is right when it says that it is a "valuable piece
of business property."
So, with this point all settled, and settled beyond
dispute, it is up to the bidders.
STEP, UP, GENTLEMEN! WHAT DO YOU
OFFER?

The two brothers, charged

Perhaps he would have failed but
for the a.«sltance of the generous

opportunity to annex the votes of
Mr. Smith's friends, what there

Mr. Hamilton offered Mr. Smith

Then appeared again the crool,

He repeated the story of l/igu,
who said the Japanese telephoned
about having some trouble.
He pointed out that a "Jimmy

of the theory
"1 heard the next morning that
the mayor had a fit and was going

them thev would be arrested—"
Mayor CJIII was in the court room.
"While you are talking about

"He's not hiding," retorted Van

and rode In his automobile with
me past police headquarters yester
day."
"Well, I want him, too," said tha
mayor, "why don't you turn him

The two Billingsleys were taken
Into the booking room of pollca

went out to get the 120,000.
He posted It with Raymond Fry,

It Is all due to the capability of
Mr. Smith, public servant.

So active has Mr. Smith been
during the. past few months that on

the river fund.
It was apparent at that time that
Mr. Smith's energies must be di
rected to other fields of endeavor.
The $467 will probably be needed to
1 keep the river channels greased the
rest of the year.
So you now see Mr. Smith in an

It is In this role that he obtains
