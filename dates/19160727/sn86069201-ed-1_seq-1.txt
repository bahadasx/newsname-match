A number of important changes were
made in the school laws of the State by
the last legislature, applicable to Gar
rard county as well as other counties cf
Kentucky, which have just become ef
fective. For instance, the annual elec
tio of school trustees under the revised
school laws, willin tho future beheld
on the first Saturday In October, In
stead of the first Saturday in August,
and the incumbents hold office until
next March. Other changes may be
summarized as follows: The school cen
sus will be taken biennially; under the
compulsory school law parents and guar
dians may be put in jail for failure to
pay fines assessed for not sending chil
dren to school; the amount of money a
county may spend for children Is in
increased from $100 to $200; counties
may erect joint high schools; graded
districts must maintain a high scool or
pay tuition for their graduates, and the
graded district trustees may increase

tax from $1 60 to $2 50; railroad and
bridge taxes due special districts are
collected by the county school depart
ment instead of the sheriff, and students
entering the high school at twenty
years of age may continue through the
The meeting called for last Monday
for the farmers of the county, brought
out quite a number of the most pro
gressive fnrmers to discuss the ad
visability of getting a farm demonstra
tor for Garrard county. The meeting
was called to order by G. II. Swin
uroau aim on motion W. It. Cook was
made chairman and It. L. Elkin
Secretary. Mr. Swinebroad stated the
object of the meeting and gave many
good reasons why a farm demonstra
tor should be had in this county, and
the'many advantages to be derived
from this progressive movement. He
cited many counties of the state where
liny are being employed and spoke of
the rapid progress luch counties had
made under the supervision of a farm
agent. Several spoke of the advan
tages to be gained and of the work
such method had accomplished in other
parts of the state. Among those who
spoke were: F. M. Tinder, E. C.
McWhorter. J. E. Ri.binson and Judge
U A. Arnold.
The expense of employing one of the
demonstrators is from $1200 tc $1800
year, one half of which is shared by
tin government and the other half is
usually put up by the fiscal court. A
committee composed of G. II. Swine
broad. E. C. McWhorter and W. R.
Cook, was appointed to wait upon the
riscai court and ask that an ap
propriation be made from the general
fund to aid in securing this agent. This
committee to report back at a call
meeting of the chairman.
Garrard county is by far the best
producing county in the state and I am
heartily in favor of the movement to
employ a farm agent," said Mr. E. C.
McWhorter, who has seen the effect
of such work in the mountain counties
of the state.
COURT DAY DRAWS
FAIR CROWD.
Only a medium sized crowd attended
Court Day here Monday, and stock
sales were slow. Several mules and a
few cattle changed hands. Politics was
the order of the day and three candi
dates for Congress were here present
ing their claims to the voters. Roth
Stato Senator Chas Montgomery and
Representative Harvey Helm, the Dem
ocratic candidates feel sure of winning
and Robert Davison of Stanford who is
a Republican candidate against Chas.
Neat of Columbia, says that his name
will be on the ballot in November.
FARMER
HOLDS THE BAG.
When the Kentucky Rural Credit
Association went to the wall, many
farmers and other citizens of Kentucky,
and among whom are many Garrard
county farmers, were swindled out of
several hundreds of thousands of dol
lars. Somebody stole and somebody
has been rot-bed. An investigation by
the courts should be had and the guilty
parties, be they high or low, should be
punished.
It may be proven that it was the
slick agents who sold the stock to the
farmers or perchance it may be men
high up in political and business life, or
it may be both; at any rate the people
have been robbed and the guilty ones
should be punished.
