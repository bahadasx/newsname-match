OUR JUDGE -

Next Thursday the people will
b called upon to-elect a Judge
and an Attorney General for tius

Judge Frank L? Lynch' was ap

MeKenzie Attorney General by
Governor Rye ' less than twoJ
yars ago, soon after this district
. Ufa created by the last legftla.
In the ..race next" Thursday,1
'$ Judge Lynch is said to have op
position. We never sa'viTiis op
ponent, but have heard " of him
frequently He is not a lawyer;
: and has not practiced law fin 20
years or morels we are informed I

- ' ' Judse'Lvnck is a young lawyet
' since' his election he has; been
dilligently applying ' himself,
studying to make a better lawyer
and a better judge. 1 He is pati
ent and will hear, while on the
(' bench, the complaint or the story
of any one, it matters not how
humble the party may be. He is
patient with, the lawyers and al
' ways "givesfthem plenty of time
to present their cases. In fact,
Mr. Lynch is making a good judge
and will gradually grow stronger
and better as. time passes owing ;
to the experience and his studi
ous habits) t-No doubt he .has
made some mistakes in the past,
and we would be surprised if he
did not make mistakes in the fu
tture, butthis could be said of
any lawyer in the country eleva
ted to the position - of '' Judged
Mr. Lynch will be re-elected as
he should be, and will then hold
the office for two years or until
the next regular August election
when his successor will be elected
in other words in order to serve
the people in this capacity for a
ltttle more than three years and
a half, Judge Lynch to make the
, light for the appointment before
the governor and now has to make
the race before the people. Or
dinarily when a officer does his
' duty the first term, he is aceord
i ed an endorsemnt by re-electing
him to succeed himself but in
i this instance Judsre Lynch has
not had the fourth of a regular
term and yet he has opposition.
Gen. MeKenzie is more fortu
nate. He has no opposition and
it 18 well for any man ' that he
hasn't Ben MeKenzie for an op
ponent. He is a strong prose
cutor, and at the same time when
convinced that the accused is in
nocent there is no power under
the sun to cause him to prosecute
He is a big hearted generous

To the Public.
On Thursday, August 3 1910,
will be held an election for
county officers, a county Board
of Education, and for a Board
of Mayor and Alderman, who
constitute also the Board of Edu
cation of Tracy Oiiy.
A number of citizens feel that
there ought to be some unity of
action by our people' in electing
the Mayor and Alderman.
The bill incorporating Tracy
City prov ided that Dr. C. W .
Hembree should be first Mayor,
Mr. E. W. Robertson, the Record
er, and G. M. Thorogood, L, G.
Henderson, and Samuel Werner,
Alderman.- 'iiVi;';;
These gentlemen have I served
our community with great ability
and faithfulness, and we feel sure
that the entire citizenship of
Tracy City appreciate the utisel
fish apd unrewarded service they
have rendered in behalf of our
town and our school.
Our charter required that, at
this election on Aug. 3, a Mayor,
shall be elected fot six years, a
Recorder and alderman for four
years, and two aldermen for two
years. At each election there
after, the officer or officers whose
terms expire that yeur, shall be
elected for a term of six . years,
thus insuring that not more than
two members of the Board shall
be chosen at any election.
The present Board of Educat
ion are having put In the School"
buildini a new heating .outfit
Vewaiu; wiucii nau uecome an
absolute necessity.
Not a man on our Board is in
any sense a candidate for re-election.
In fact some of them ac
tually prefer not to be elected
this time. But we feel sure,
that if citizens of Tracy City
should elect them again, simply
because they appreciate their un
selfish service, they would serve
us again.
.' Therefore, for the sake of har
mony and unity of action, we
suggest the following ticket . to
the voters of the corporation of
Tracy City:
For Mayor, for six years, Dr." 0.
W. Hembree, For Recorder, for
four years, E. W. Robertson,
For Alderman, for four years, G.
M. Thorogood, For Alderman, for
two years, Samuel Werner, For
Alderman, for two years, L, G.
Henderson.
This suggestion is made to the
DOLLARS COUNT
AT THE STORE OF
W. A. CODD
Let everyone in Tracy City be a
stockholder for he gives
$1.10 cents worth of Goods
For $1.00 cash
IF you borrow money from a bank or s individual you
pay 6 and 8 per cent, he gives you 10 per cent on your
investment, in good Fresh Groceries and Merchandise,
h o would give you a better proposition. Make your
, DOLLARS count at the store of
W. A. CODD
voters of Tracy City without the
knowledge or consent of the mem
bers of the present Board of May
or and Aldermen, by fifteen or
twenty of the citizens who simply
are interested in the welfare of
the School and the community.
Remember that our charter
provides that all our officers shall
have no salaries. Of course the.
one who collects the taxes or
takes the uensus, will be r aid at
the rate provided for such ser-.
vice by the laws of the state.
Lei every voter in the corporate
limits of Tracy City , go to the
court house on. the third of Aug.
and.8hov his appreciation of the
men who have served us so faith
fully and so unsellishly.
Many Citizens.
TO THE VOTERS
GRUNDY COUNTY
Owing to the fact that it has
been impossible for me to see
every voter in the county and
personally solicit his support in
my raca for Trustee, I take this
method of saying to one and all
that no man will appreciate your
support more than I will, and as
a test of my appreciation, I will
if elected devote my entire time
to the duties of the office! to the
end that the office may be proper
ly conducted, and the interest of
the people a iid of the county, al
ways safeguarded.
! .Only a few more days of the
campaign remain, during which
dtluw I w.ilLtte ft4.ma.ny.nLynjua
possible, but if I tail to see you,
just remember that I want your
support any way, and 'that I am
making this race on my own mer
its, not upon the demerits , of
another, and if you believe in ro
tation in office and in following
the established custom in this
county, and that I am capable of
rendering you the kind of service
hr this position that a public
seryant ought to render, then I
most earnestly appeal to you for
your support, and if elected I will
treat every man courteously and
shall endeavor to conduct mv-,
self and the duties of the office m
such manner that no man will
ever have occasion to regret hav
ing voted for me.
Very respectfully, -.
John Gallagher.
