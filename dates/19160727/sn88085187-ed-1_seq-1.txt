So declares Senator John Sharp
Williams, chairman of the sub

been appointed to consider the in

other members of this subcommit

The endorsement by Senator
Williams of publicity for the in

of any other two senators, not
only because of the position that
ho occupies as tho democrat in
charge of the income tax bill in
the senate, but also because he Is
one of the majority leaders and
one of the strongest debaters in
the United States senate.
A bill ordering publicity for in

Taxpayers, a word of good

Alfred Lister, school secretary,
in his annual report, read to the
board Wednesday afternoon, says:
"We will be able to maintain
the present standard of the
schools without increasing the ex

reducing the tax levy."
He bases this statement on the
fact that buildings and equipment
are inexceptionally good condi
tion.
The 191.".-191 6 expense of ;un
ning the schools, he points out,
wbb $6,827 more than for the pre
vious year, due to necessary re
pairs and to accidents from the
use of physical equipment.
Some of the other high points
in his report are that:
There are 19,689 children be
tween the ages of 5 and 21 In the
district; 18,610 enrolled during
the year; the average attendance
wan 12,684.
There were employed 82 men
teachers at an average irnlary of
$147.61 and 342 women teachers
at $99.83. on a 10-months' basis.
There are 33 school houses in
the district, with a seating rapa
city of 14,404 and valued, vrttfc
their grounds, at $2,813,097.
The total value of school prop
erty Is $3,198,253; the assessed
value of the district $64,042,011;

tlie park board from using l.y,
for | breakwater at Point Defi
ance, mo that the city may utifl
it for a permanent highway and
fishermen's protection wall at
Old Taconia.
Commissioner Uronen told the
Members' council of the club
Wednesday afternoon of the
park board's action, devlmlng
that Ihe hoard had selfishly
blocked a great municipal mi
provement for the benefit of the
Taioma Yacht club.
"if the park board uses the
Hini'lter sluk for a breakwater, It
will cost the city thousands of
dollars," said Kronen.
"It means that wo will prncti
cally have to rebuild the present
trestle road along the north wa
terfront. If we had the slhk. we
could build a permanent rock
highway, a j a , a i,. O { 200 lineal
feet a day."
Tlie park board contemplates
a breakwater It.OOO feet long, and
25 feet wide at the top. It will b«
in 4 5 feet or water. Construc
tion will take several years.
