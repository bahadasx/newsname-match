AUGUST 1
It is higlily important that
every Republican in Wright county should get to
- the polls and vote on Primary Day, August 1 , no
matter whom we may favor for' nomination.
Every man who intends to vote for Hughes and
Fairbanks is entitled to help nominate the Re
publican ticket at the primary election. Indeed,
it is his duty to help. ...
:-Let's . proe on -Primary ;Day
s that the Republican, party is the1 biggest "party in '
Missouri, To do that, we'll all have to vote.
;The Democrats always do. And while we are
, :' at it,.N why not vote for a great business man,
' WALTER S. DICKEY, for U. S. Senator? His
nomination will guarantee success.
FOR U. S. SENATOR
Those who know Walter S. Dickey know that he is, first
of alt a patriot and after that a Republican whose devotion
to his party is based on his conviction that it stands for what
is best in Nation and State and who is therefore incapable of
being swerved from party loyalty by any consideration of
merely personal ambition or aggrandizement, either for him
self or anybody else. That's the sort of Republican Walter
S. Dickey has always been. He gave the party more than
thirty years of unselfish and forceful service before he be
came a candidate for favors at its hands. Mr. Dickey is a
candidate for the nomination for United States Senator be
cause assurances have come to him from all parts of the
state that his nomination will strengthen the ticket and help
to guarantee its victory. Be consider that no man ought to
be nominated for any office unless he is the strongest nan
that can be chosen for that place, because he regards Repub
lican victory this year of more importance than any man's
personal ambition.

Donl let then "middy" the issue. There arc false issues in
this campaign.
HooehiQ knows ratal Missouri and her needs.
Houchin' plan for road building is practical and it will build 100
miles of rock roads in every county of Missouri by using idle coo
ricts and the 'automobile tax without adding one dollar of extra
taxation upon any one.
Houchin is again idle clerks, useless departments, nepotism,
and will give you a house-ckaaing at Jefferson City if he gets a
chance. There is no fight on Houchin, he wtj cany the party vote
and a large iasVjpcadcat vote. His plan of working convicts on the
roads soiree the peaeteatkry labor problem and organized labor is
for him oceans it solves a problem that they have been trying for
HQXJO&'ts'A WINNER; there is no fight on hfm except
that which has bees created by the job hunters and perpetual office
holders, who have tried to make the people of Missouri believe that
Hoachia is aot a the race for Governor. The large number of
voters who art leaving other candidates and joining the ranks of
HoucHa, veho tty ksow is a winner, is a Anal denial. Get behind
Hoaehm and ood Roads. Vote for Houchin and set that your
PRIMARY
MISSOURI.
The people expect Mansfield to
hold a Rood agricultural and
stock show this year. Let s not
disappoint them. Mansfield has
an enviable reputation in this
regard and the people have come
to look forward to these events
Let us not lose this reputation.
To grow and keep things moving
a city must do things of a public
nature to please those who are
already its friends and to make
new friends. Other places are
goiog ahead with preparations
for their stock shows; let us not
be behind our sister cities. We
have always been in the front
rank. Let us not drop to the
rear and out of the procession
altogether; If everybody will
help, the success of the show is
assured. Boost, don't knock
If there have been objectidnable
features, in the past, help the
committee to eliminate them this
year. Do your - part towards
making the fair a success. All
can help some by co-operating
with the committees. Try it and
note the result.

Atkinson for Assessor
J. R. Atkinson, of Van Buren
township, whose announcement
for the Republican nomination
for assessor appears in the Mir
ror, was here during the week
in the interest of his candidacy.
We feel that he needs no intro
duction to the voters of Wright
county, as he is well and favor
ably known in every section of
the county. He is a Wright
county product, having been
born here, and lived here all his
life. He is a farmer by occupa
tion and enjoys the confidence
and good will of all who know
him. Four years ago he was a
candidate for nomination for the
same office to which he now as
pires, and proved hi a: self an ex:
cellent mixer and vote getter.
but was defeated by C. A. Steph
ens, the present assessor, by a
narrow margin, This was when
the Republican party, was split
in twain and an entire Progress
ive ticket was nominated ' in
Wright county. Mr. Atkinson
did not resent his defeat at the
primary, but did all he could at
the general election for the sue
cess of his successful competi
tor, who was the only Republi
can elected to office in Wright
county that year. Mr. Atkinson
is well qualified for the position
of assessor, and will be a for
midable candidate for the nomi
nation. He says, -that if he is
nominated and eleeted he will
during his term of office visit
every taxpayer in $he county for
the purpose of taking his assess
ment, and will as far as possible
personally do the work required
to be done by an assessor. He
is qualified to do so, and prom
ises the people an able and im
partial administration of the
work of the office, should he be
the next assessor of Wright
county.
Hon.A.B. Lovan of Springfield,
Republican candidate for the Re
publican nomination for the
Springfield Court of Appeals, was
here Tuesday enroute home from
Ray born and Hartville, where he
delivered I.O. 0. F. addresses.

HON. T j. AKINS '
Of St. Louis, Republican Candi
date for tjr..S. Senator ;
M. E. Dennis for Sheriff
When yon go to the polls Tues
day to vote, his many friends
will be pleased,, to have, you re
member' that Pleasant Valley
township has a candidate for
sheriff in tbtV person of M. E
Dennis, a worthy young Repub
lican who is in; every way admir
ably qualified to act as sheriff of
Wright county. Milt is well
known over the county and needs
no introduction at our hands to
the Republican voters. That he
is a strong factor in the race is
plainly evidenced by the splendid
encouragement he is receiving in
the extensive "campaign he is
now and has been making in
every part of the county. People
naturally like to vote for a good
man, for a Strong candidate, ior
a man whose 'qualifications are
of the7 best, - tad the fact, his
friends claim, that he looks like
a winner, is 'bringing him addi
tional vWesp-as- the ' primary
draws near. If Milt receives the
nomination- next Tuesday, it will
be a tribute to a good citizen and
a stalwart Republican, and it
will insure on the county ticket
in November the name of a man
who will receive not only the
Republican vote of the county
but many other votes as well. A
vote cast for Milt Dennis Tues
day is a vote well cast.
Will Receive Applications
E. D. Levy, general manager of
the Frisco Railroad, states that,
inasmuch as the train,engine and
switching crews on. the Frisco
are voting on a strike, he will re
ceive applications for such posi
tions. These applications are to
be sent to him at Springfield
Missouri. Mr. Levy expresses the hope
that a strike will not be declared
but believes in preparedness.
The railroads of the United
States have expressed a willing
ness to let the Interstate Com,
merce Commission handle the
controversy between them and
the train, engine and switching
crew employes, upon the latters
demand of the so-called "Eight
Hour Day," which would mean
an additional wage increase of
$100,000,000 a year. ,
This proposition has been re
fused by the heads of the organ
izations, who have ordered that
a strike vote be taken.
To the Republican Voters of
Wright County, Missouri:
I would have liked to have visi
ted every voter personally in
making the campaign for asses
sor of Wright county; but I find
it impossible to do so before the
primary, but I assure you that
your support for my interest for
the Republican nomination for
assessor will be appreciated. I
stand for honesty and for square
dealing, and, if nominated and
elected, I will give my personal
attention to the duties of the
office to which I aspire.

R. H Yates, secretary of the
KeothomaOil Co. of Louisville,
Ky., was here during the week
investigating the prospects for
the active development of the
famous Redbird mine, said to be
ooe of the best miues in the
Mansfield territory.
M r. Yates is . associated .with
the owners of the mine and
came here to learn the exact sit
uation. He expressed himself
as well pleased with what he saw
and said that within a short time
this mine would be worked as it
deserved, it is too valuable a
property to lie comparatively
idle. ' Mr. Yates goes on the
theory that it is more profitable
to develop to the fullest extent a
mine of known worth than to ex
periment on doubtful prospects,
hence his decision that the Red
bird shall be made to yield its
treasure of valuable ore. This
mibe,. he says, has never been
worked as it should be, . but he
says the time is now ripe for
mining in earnest. Our people
should assist in every . way pos
sible in helping to bring this
mine to its utmost capacity.
Owners of adjoining tracts of
land, which may be found to con
tain just as much valuable ore,
should assist in the work and
not hinder by unreasonable de
mands.
Mr. Yates has had years of
experience, especially m the oil
fields, where land owners form a
pool to assist in development, all
contributing -to a development
fond, the owner, of the land on!
which the work ia done' putting
a tb jp?t,.m.oneyi What helps
one man Viand should help:- all,'
as the development of one tract
may lead to the profitable de
velopment of adjoining laud.
It is impossible to predict the
boom that would result from the
proper development of the min
ing industry here, and we hope
our people will manifest the
right spirit and lend a hand to
all who are trying to bring this
development about.
Frank Schuermann and A. T.
Friend have been doing lots of
good work and are to be com
mended for their zeal in calling
attention to the latent possibili
ties in the mining industry here.
M. G. Hensley for Assessor
As the primary date, . ap
proaches we desire once more to
call the attention of the Republi
can voters of Wright county to
the fact that M. G. Hensley of
Mansfield, known all over Wright
county as Marsh Hensley, is a
candidate for the Republican
nomination for assessor, and
that he will greatly appreciate
your vote next Tuesday.
Marsh Hensley is one of the
old-time Republican war-horses
the county.- He has always
been found fighting the battles
of the Republican party.
He has never held a county
office, but he would like to . now.
The office to which he aspires is
one which he is amply qualified
to till in a business-like manner.
If elected, he will devote his per
sonal attention to the work. He
making an active campaign,
and has tried to visit every Re
publican voter in the county, but
if he has not seen you it is be
cause he has been unable to do
so. He desires and will appre
ciate your vote and has tried to
see you and tell you so,
' He promises, if elected, to call
personally, during his term of
office, if possible, upon every
taxpayer of the county. A vote
for him is a vote for a man who
will take active, personal charge
of the work. His many friends
realize that he is a strong candi
date and will be glad to have you
vote for Marsh Hensley for as
sessor when you go to the . polls
next Tuesday.

to Commercial Street, and eight
loads of cinders have been placed
