lealth, and it was thought that
;he trouble would soon pass away
Accordingly his wife made him
.ie down on a couch in a darken

ittendedto other duties about

Dear Editor:-As stated in
my last letter, we left Mt. Gret
na July 9th. At Harrisburg I
was one of a squad detailed to
store provisions in the cooking
car. Our train then passed over
the main line of the Pennsylva
nia railroad westward. At Co-
umbus, Ohio, the troops were
given a little exercise to prevent
them from getting tired of rid
ing. Our next stop was Indian
apolis. At Terre Haute we were
given a hearty reception, lemo
nade was served and each man
was given a postcard to send
home. The trip across the state
of Indiana was almost a continu
ous ovation. Going by way of
St. Louis and Kansas City to Dal
hart, Oklahoma, we were again
given another exercise of about
fifteen minutes at Dalhart. Past
ng through Oklahoma, Arizona,
and New Mexico, we found the
towns rather small and scattered
and the land given over chiefly
to grazing.
At last we arrived at our new
lome five miles from El Paso,
at a small station called Fort
Bliss. Everything is very quiet
here not as much excitement as
in old Pennsylvania. Will write
more as soon as I get a line on
the situation here. Please send
my paper to Camp and publish
my full address for the benefit of
parents and any who may wish
to get in touch with Company C.
Thank you for the stamps they
are a scarce article here.
Yours truly,

The following suggestions are from
care of Infants:
The hot weather of this season of tlio year Is extremely dangerous to tho lives of Infants and young children, not
only becauso of the depressing effects of high atmospheric temperature In general, but more especially because of
the effect of hot weuther upon all perishable articles of food, among which cow's milk holds the first place.
It Is therefore highly Important that cow's milk to ha used for infants' food should be the purest and freshest
that you can afford to buy. During the hot weather ice Is absolutely necessary for tho preservation of milk, and all
milk used for food should bo cooled by ice as soon as it comes from the cow and should be kept next to the ice until
ready to be used. A little money spent for Ico may prevent illness and its much greater expense for medicine,
nursing and medical attendance. As water is often a carrier of disease, It is safest to use only boiled water for
drinking or tho preparation of a baby's food.
Breast Feeding. Every mother should endeavor to nurse her baby. Dreast milk is the' natural food of the new
born baby. There is no other food that can comparo with It. A breast-fed baby has a much groater chance of living
than a bottle-fed baby.
Uottlo Feeding. If it bocomes necessary to feed the baby either entirely or only in part upon the bottle, remember
that the greatest cleanliness is ncce3sary in all details of the feeding. As soon as a bottle Is finished, it should be
thoroughly washed vlth cold water, theu cleased with hot water and borax (1 teaspoonful to a pint of water) and put
shle for further cleansing before being usod again. If you h ive only a few bottles and it becomes necessary to use the
jaiiio bottle for the next feeding, boil it for a few minutes b.fore putting fresh food into It. Never let the baby nurso
from tho remains of a bottle which ha has not finished at once. Take It away from tho crib, pour out the milk, and
clcaneo at once. Stalo milk curds sticking to the insido of a Loitlo after a few hours become poisonous and may con
laminate fresh milk coming in contact with them. It is better to have, as many bottles as the number of the baby's
laily feedings, so that all the bottles can be boiled together before the food is prepared In the morning.
Attacked By Dogs.
One day during latter part of
last week, Mrs. Nancy Sprig?,
who lives at the foot of the Ridge
west of town, had an experience
with dogs that she will not for
get. Nancy was frying meat
and when her attention was at
tracted elsewhere for about two
seconds a dog grabbed the meat
and ran. Nancy followed, but
another dog . caught her by the
ankle and bit her severely so that
she had to seek medical aid. Dr.
Robinson dressed the - wounds.
One dog was killed. - Nancy ha3
the sympathy of many friends
for the loss of her supper and
for the painful wounds.
Camped Along (lie Way.
Tuesday, July 18th, Mr. and
Mrs. W. II. McNeil and their

camped along the the way, and
traveled leisurely until Tuesday

a circular issued by Commissioner of
House Burned.
Last Sunday evening, the
dwelling house owned and occupi
ed by Eb Lake east of Scrub
Ridge, on what is known as the
Dalbey place, near the Lincoln
Highway, was destroyed by fire
together with all the contents.
Mr. and Mrs. Lake were in Mc
Connellsburg attending preach
ing when the fire broke out and
they knew nothing of their loss
until they neared their home
some time after nineo'clock. A
neighbor, Abram Pittman, was
the first to arrive at the fire, and
he reports that the whole build
ing, including the roof, was a
mass of flames, making it impos
sible to save anything in the
house. Those who saw it before
the building fell think the fire
started in the garret, and that a
smoldering fire in the flue may
have been the cause. In addi
tion to another household goods,
forty dollars in money went up
in smoke. Although there was
some insurance, the loss will be
keenly felt by the young people
who went to house keeping only
about two years ago "Eb" is a

Must Grin and Bear It.
By roason of certain factors
never before known in a presi
dential campaign, the present
one has brought to the surface
the most disgusting editorials
ever inflicted upon a long-suffer
ing public. Listen to what the
Sage of Potato Hill says about it:
"The real questions of moment
are hidden in the crime of over
praise or overabuse; the real
news is covered up by means of
sensationalism or prejudice. For
merly an American, when politics
because so bad he could n6 long
er stand it, . might call his dog,
put out his fire, and move out
west, to make a new start; but
the free land in the West has
been taken up; the only thing to
do now is to reform public af
fairs." , ..

Health, Samuel G. Dixon, relative to the
Ttliere Are Her Friends?
Mrs. D. A. Stoops, Grove City,
Pa., sent money to pay up until
1917 and asked what had become
of her friends in the southern
part of this county? She and
others would like to hear from
friends through the News. Let's
see about it.
Correspondents in the south
ern part of the County complain
that their mails do not reach the
News in time for publication.
Let's see about that too. Bet
we can hit the nail on the head
first crack at it. It is because
the correspondent thinks he or
she must wait until after Sunday
to mail their letters to us guess
ed it first trial, didn't we? Now
why should you wait until after
Sunday? All that happens on
Sunday that is worth printing
would go into three lines. Now,
friends please try our ' plan just
a few times and see how well it
will work. Sit down each Fri
day evening, or, in time to catch
the Saturday mail out, and write
up the news of the week, deaths,
marriages, accidents, strangers
in the neighborhood, and who
have gone away (say for 25 miles
or more,) and if you should hap
pen to forget a few neighborhood
Sunday visits, we and our read
ers will freely forgive you. Try
mailing your letters from these
distant points on Saturday.
Ask us for stamped and self
addressed envelopes for corres
pondentswe furnish them free
ly. But you must notify us
when to send.
Free Sheep.
Inquiry about the 'free sheep'
mentioned several times by the
News is being made, To all in
quirers, we reply, Address the
Secretary of Agriculture, Char
les E. Patton, Harrisburg, Pa.
He will give you all desired in
formation, or put you in touch
with the manufacturers who are
, paying for the sheep.
Mr. and Mr3. George A. Har

a few days this week.
Little Talks on Health and lijgicne by
Samuel G. Dixon, H. D., LI. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Our streams once undefiled by
man ran from the mountains to
the sea in all of Nature's purity.
They ran through our valleys and
meadows in all their pristine
beauty and offered to all animate
nature that which would inno
cently quench the thirst of man
and beast and help, them live.
Today it is not so. Man relent
lessly, regardless of his brother
down stream, now throws his
waste and that of domestic ani
mals into the waters flowing
nearest his home.
In that with which Nature has
endowed much of our territory
more richly than many other
countries, we now find lurking
poison has been hidden, in some
cases only to be seen by the aid
of the microscope.
Now is the season when we
travel through the country to be
happy and lay up energy and
strength for the toll of the com
ing winter. Alas! The want of
intelligence and care makes us
deaf to the teaching of preven
tive medicine and we quench our
thirst at the stream we run
across regardless of its purity,
and often the sparkling tumbler
of water is only to be compared
with the draught of the deadly
hemlock. The parched lips have
been moistened and the thirst
satisfied but the day of judgment
too often comes bringing the de
velopment of typhoid fever which
in years past we could only com
pare with some of the plagues
that ravaged our ancient cities.
Those of us who collect, tabu
late, and have ever before us the
statistics that show the suffering
and sorrow that still continue
from typhoid fever, beg you to
awake to that which causes so
much distress. By proper care
it can be avoided.
Never drink out of an unknown
surface stream. When traveling
see that pure water i9 carried
along as well as food, otherwise
the harvest of sickness and death
will follow and defeat the object
of summer vacations.
How to Buy Fertilizer.
For the season of 191(, we be
lieve there will be little fertilizer
sold containing nitrogen and pot
ash. If the analysis, always
plainly marked on bags, indicate
the presence of either of these
two ingredients, there will be
sure to be a prohibitive price
asked by the manufacturer. As
an illustration if but one per
cent, potash is indicated, the ad
ded price will be several dollars
a ton, Now, we all know that
unless several hundred pounds to
the acre be used, one per cent,
potash would not grow a hill of
beans, and since few farmer in
Fulton County have the courage
to apply more than 200 pounds of
fertilizer to the acre, we hearti
ly advise that nothing but acid
phosphate be purchased this year
Keep clear of all goods marked
with half, or one per cent of
any other part Buy the straight
acid goods 14 to 15 per cent pure.
This is the year in which lime
should be liberally applied. Then
as our best farmers know, use
all efforts to produce sods. The
practice of using lime and ferti
lizer to produce cash crops of
grain is ruinous our thousands
of "run down"cres should be
proof sufficient. Produce stiff
sods and you will never again
say that "Fertilizers last but one
year." Plough these sods down
before they have been robbed
until a rabbit would starve on
them, and the vexing question of
reclaiming lands will have been
solved. I
Chambersburg papers are giv
ing warning to all auto drivers
that all unnecessary noises due
to open cut-outs will surely bring
trouble to the offender. We can-
, not find a word of fault with the
jtown for thesane move.
