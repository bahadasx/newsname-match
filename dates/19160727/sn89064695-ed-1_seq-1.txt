The best friend the Chippewas
of Minnesota have ever had iD
Congress has written to the pub
lisher of THE TOMAHAWK relative
to the recent primary election, and
makes the following statement
which we have assumed he will
not object to having published.
I could not'et the occasion pass
without writing you a letter rela
tive to the recent primaries. Of
course the service I have rendered,
or sought to render the Indians,
was not with any view of securing
votes, but it certainly is a matter
of appreciation to realize the ex
pression of their gratitude and
appreciation."
"I shall never lose my interest
in the Indians, although after next
spring will not be in a position to
legislate for them. The progress
they have made is very gratifying
to every friend they have and I
think the general trend of legis
lation will be to liberalize and
give them more and more opport
unity*
Since' the primary has gone
against me, I hope, of course, my
friends will cordially support Mr.
Kellogg."
"Thanking you and all my
friends there beyond expression."
Mr. C. A. Congdon, national
Republican committeeman of Min
nesota, in reply to a letter from
the publisher says: "that there is
no doubt whatever that Mr. Kel
logg will be elected, and inasmuch
as the Chippewas always noed
friends in court in Washington, it
seems to me it would be the part
of wisdon to support a man who is
going to be in Washington and
from whom they are certain to ask
favors."
"In addition to that, it is my own
personal judgment that Mr. Kel
logg will make an excellent ser.a

gratitude the Indians showed to
wards Senator Clapp by their vote
almost as much as the latter does.
Senator Clapp not only shows a
very broad spirit by appealing to
his Indian friends to support his
opponent, but his friendship to
wards Mr. Kellogg is so unquestion
able that those who know both men
have no doubt about this.
This is a period that the Chippe
was of Minnesota surely "need a
friend in courtat Washington" and
the advice of two of their good
friends should be heeded.
From Whose Employment
Does He Resign*
William Furst, in a letter to the
publisher of THE TOMAHAWK,
states, after paying his compli
ments to the latter, that he has re
signed as as "one of the attorneys."
Who employed Mr. Furst? We
are positive that the publisher did
not, and why he should notify the
latter of his resignation is beyond
his comprehension.
But then the following letter
from Mr. Furst and the reply
thereto is intended to throw some
light on the subject. The letters
concern the interests of the Chip
pewas of Minnesota, and they are
entitled to know the contents there
of, hence they are published.
Minneapolis, July, 22nd. 1916.
G. H. Beaulieu, Esq.
White Earth, Minrrrf
Dear Sir:
I have read with much interest
your article in THE TOMAHAWK of
July 20th as to the fight between
the Furst and the anti Furst forces.
I would like a couple of extra
copies and enclose ten cents in
stamps to pay for the name.
From what little I know of the
situation 1 am constrained to say
that 1 do not believe it WHS any
contest, between any forces except
the force-* that can properly be call
ed the "Gus Beaulieu clique" and
the fair mined intelligent Indians
who refuse to submit to your not
always intelligent attempt to domi
nate the situation. As to the abi
lity of Mr. Rue or myself you are
not a competent judge. As to the
charactei of the work done in my
tor, and one whom we shall all be office or the office of Mr. Rue I
glad to have elected, after he has doubt if you know anything
I went into this matter prepared
show what he can do. I trust the to do ray part but 1 stated in Detro-
Chippewas will tfive him a fine it that I would not be a party to a
majority next November."
Mr. Condgon needs no intro
duction to the Chippewas of Min
nesota for while he was United
States district attorney the older
men of the tribe, during the twelve
or fifteen years he was in the office,
became well acquainted with him,
and many of the boys of that date
owe him a debt of gratitude for
letting them off for some technical
violation of the United States law
relative to the introduction of
iquo upon Chippewa reservations
his aim was only to secure the
punishment of bootleggers.
Charles Moultou, a member of
this reservation, the Mille Lac
chiefs and others, could tell the
Chippewas of Minnesota that in
1898 at Washington, Mr. Congdon
gave them valuable aid in inducing
Judge Page Morris and Frank M
Eddy, then congressmen, to help
the Indians in their matters and
that it was through his influence
that the two congressmen held
been there a long enough time to
bitter and acrimonious fight and I
either would have a harmonious
meeting with the Chippewa dele
gations at which Mr. Condgon him
self was present.
The Chippewas made no mistake expense in connection with the
when they voted solidly for Sena
tor Clapp, and ah ho be %as not vinced that the attitude you assume
renominated his successful oppo- is one of great detriment to the real
chent or would withdraw from the clination of entering into tne pro-
case. I meant what I said. Your
own apparent attempt to "rule or
ruin" is not to be tolerated by me
for one minute. You have no
special knowledge of the situation
that gives you any greater author
ity than a good many others. Be
that as it may 1 cannot and will not
act and shall say to the Commit
tee what I have told you in this
letter. My resignation as one of
the attorneys goes to Mr. Frank
Beaulieu to day with a copy of this
letter. I have spent some little
time and money in this case but
that will be forgotten. I do not
speak for Mr. Rue. I do not even
know his attitude.
You have spent a good many
years in the investigation of these
Indian claims and I have no doubt
are in possession of many facts that
would be helpful but so are a great
many other people.
THE TOMAHAWK
As I am done with the matter
might add that I have made two
trips to Washington at my own
claims and am pretty firmly con-
sedition of other Indian claims. I
had other reasons also, which at
that time out of consideration to
you, 1 did not disclose but which,
since you have expressed your
opinion so freely regarding my
motive with regard to my opposi
tion to the actions of the Chippewa
Claims Commission, I do not now
hesitate to do and which are con
tained in the foregoing statement
relative to your ability.
Further overtures were made to
me which applied to my son, who
is an attorney, but I refused to
answer for what he might chose to
do in the matter.
I call attention to this in order
that neither you nor any one else
can charge me with ulterior mo
tives, lthough I do not care what
j-ou might say.

torneys present, including your-
'Truth before" Favor."!
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota,
Yours truly,
William Furst.
White Earth, Minn.,
July 24, 1916.
Mr. William Furst,
Attorney-at Law,
Minneapolis, Minn.,
Dear Sir:
Replying to your letter of the
22nd. I will say that I do not as
sume to know anything personally
regarding your qualifications gen
erally as an attorney, but formed
an opinion, from reliable infor
mation regarding you and also
from having heard read the report
of the Chippewa Claims Commis
sion at the Bemidji General Coun
cil recently, that you lack ability
to prosecute Indian claims.
If you drew the contract between
the Chippewa Claims Commission
and the Chippewas of Minnesota,
this alone would be evidence of
your lack of competency to repre
sent the important interests of the
Chippewas of Minnesota which
amount to millions of dollars. I
heaid the contract read and I could
not imagine that an attorney would
be so lacking in his understanding
of Sec. 2103 of the Revised Statu
tes of the United States as to draw
such a contract and expect any
member of the tribe who under
stands the lav/, to allow it to go un
challenged, or even consider the
person who drew it to be employed
as an attorney for the tribe.
When I was first informed that
"a simple of young men?. whd* be*
longed to the Chippewa Claims
Commission, had exceeded their
authority by arranging to employ
you as attorney for the Chippewas
of Minnesota, I took occasion to
inquire at Minneapolis regarding
your qualifications to handle such
big suits as the Chippewa claims
involve, and my information was
not satisfactory. It was after that
I met you and the Chippewa Claims
Commission, by inviiation, at De
troit. At that meeting, you may
recall, you invited me to become
associated with you in the prose
cution of the Chippewa claims,
but 1 declined to do so, and I stated
that if I had any inclination to
again be employed in Chippewa
claims I would have accepted em
ployment from the General Coun
cil when I had an opportunity to
do so. I gave as one of my reasons,
when I declined to become associ
ated with you, that I had given
twenty years of hard work in the
Mille Lac case, and from my ex
perience in that case I had no in-
self, showed such an utter lack of
knowledge regarding the law under
which Indian contracts can be ob
tained legally that I immediately
became convinced that you would
not be able to properly prosecute
Chippewa claims. If it was true
that you had any knowledge of the
law, you made a great error by
permitting Frank Beaulieu to read
and offer the contractile had at the
meeting. But to he candid with
you I do not believe you knew the
law at that time notwithstanding
your statements after I called your
attention to it, for you were un
able to tell what the first section
piovided when I suggested the
question to you.
The Chippewa interests, which
include my interests as well as the
interests of every individual Chip
pewa in Minnesota, are of too much
importance to prevent me from
opposing the employment of inex
perienced and incompetent attor
neys to look after and prosecute
them, even though I am charged
by you with an attempt to "rule
or ruin."
You insult the intelligence of a
large majority of the members of
this reservation by referring to
them as the "Gus Beaulieu clique."
This in itself would be sufficient
for them to repudiate you if you
had been properly retained to re
present them, for every member
of this reservation thinks for him
self, and acts for himself, and,
therefore, there is no "Gus Beau-
1'eu clique." This statement on
ou part should help the members
)t. the Chippewa tribe to guage
jour calibre properly.
'As another illustration of jour
incompetency I call attention to
the following:
The Chippewa Claims Commis
sion have no approved contract
such as is required by United States
law, and before the commissioners
could hope to have their contract
become valid, even if approved by
the Secretary of the Interior and
Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
thej' must comply with the provi
sions of the resolution which creat
ed the commission. Furthermore,
your employment bj* several mem
bers of the commission does not
constitute employment by the tribe
which did not authorize it. If the
commission had au approved con
tract the commissioners, such as
might wish to do o, could trans
fer their interests in the contract
to you with the permission of the
Secretary of the Interior, other
wise thej' could not do so.
When the commissioners accept
ed emploj'ment under the provi
sions of the resolution which creat
ed the commission, thojr

bound

should have done before their eon
tractcould have become fully opera
tivc. The provisions of the reso
lution have not been complied with
and absolutely nothing has been
dono to fulfill' them. It may be
true that some abstracts have been
obtained by one of the com
missiorers, and that the council
proceedings of last j'rar and a pre
vious year were copied in order to
obtain the information I furnished
the Cass Lake and Bemidji meet
ings, but the principal provision
of the resolution remains unfulfill
ed, namely that the commission
would take steps within a year to
secure the passage of a juris-

the Chippewas to sue for their
claims in the Court of Claims. The
mere introduction of a bill in con
gress for this purpose does not con
stitute efforts to secure the passage
of the bill as pro\ ided by the reso
lution.
You refer to a resignation as at
torney which you have sent to
Frank Beaulieu. I cannot see where
in I could be interested in this as
an individual, nor where the Chip
pewas generally could be interest
ed since your employment by any
one in their behalf was never auth
orized in anjTcouncil.
You, in fact,
have evidently resigned from a
position you never held.
You aUo mention in jour letter
to me that you had made two trips
to the City of Washington, and had
incurred some expense. Unfort
