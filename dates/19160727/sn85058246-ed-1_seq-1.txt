NEPHI L. MORRIS
WILL WORK FOR
PROHIBITION
Visits Cache and States There Is
Much Interest In His Campaign
Throughout the South
Nephl L. Morris, candidate for tho
Republican nomination Tor governor,
accompanied by Jesse M. Cannon, of
Salt Lako City, was in Logan 'es
terday. Mr. Morris hag been making
a tour of the different counties of
the state In the Interest of his can
didacy and upon returning from some
of tho leading counties south of Salt
Lako City, says he Hnds a very friend
ly feeling manifest In his behalf and
many leAdlng Republicans are tak
ing an interest In his campaign.
Tho people of Utah know where
Mr, Morris stands on the liquor
question. It was he who led tho fight
for prohibition In 1909 and he has
talked It on a good many occasions
since that time."
When asked how ho felt on this all
important question, ho called atten
tion to a statement made In tho state
press a few days ago which Is ns
follows-
"That ray position might bo clear
ly understood by all who linvo any
doubt upon tho matter, permit me
to say that I am not a recent convert
to tho cnuso of statewide prohibition.
Mv conversion to it was not, brought
about by political expediency, nor Is
my advocacy of It merely to meet a
campaign emergency. On the con
trary, I have been a firm believer In
state wide prohibition for many years
and for about eight years have work
ed for It, fought for it, and believe
In It more strongly today than over.
"I am tor state wldo prohibition
and hopo to contrlbuto my full Bharo
to the consummation ot tho work wo
undertook In this stnte In 1909."
MR. GHRISTENSEN
BACK FROM HIS
EASTERN TRIP
Mr. C. M. Christensen, manager of
tho Spando Furniture Company, Is
back from his eastern furniture purch
aslng trip. He has had a most pleas
ant aud profitable trip although It has
been prettyijhot In Chicago and other
places. "IfVJne really wants to know
how to appreciate our Cache Valley
cllraato during tho Bummer months,"
said Mr. Christensen, "they should
take a trip to Chicago where It U
100 degrees In the shade. People aro
actually suffering on account of the
heat."
Ho'reports that tho crops ,ln tho
Mississippi Valley are very good. In
Wyoming they aro very poor, owing
to tho drouth. There is not much stir
about politics. Whllo there Is good
business, It seems to bo an abnormal
business condition, according to Mr.
Christensen. It seems to bo a forcod
'prosperity brought on becauso of tho
war.
While everybody Is rejoicing over
these conditions, they are wondorlug
what will bo tho result when the war
Is over, and the adjustment comes.
Labor Is getting about a. third bet
ter wages now than a year ago and
ovorybody is busy. Factories aro be
hind in their orders. Prompt deliver
ies are next to impossible.
Thore has been no great advance
In the price of furniture and as a re
sult, some exceptional bargains were
secured by Mr. Christensen,

Tax Commission Elected By People I
BY HERSCHEL BULLEN i
BflJl
It U universally recognized that the
greatest need of nny State respecting
taxation Is to obtain a fair nnd equit
able assessment. All citizens expect
and deslro to do their shnro towards
tiio maintenance, of tho government
of tho State, nnd are not so much con
cerned as to valuations nnd tax levies
ns thoy aro concerned In the matter
of equalization and ecultnble adjust'
uiunts between all property owners In
Hie Stato.
Tli a Stato of Utah at present sends
out 27 assessors nnd lunumcniblo
deputies, each a law unto himself,
without system, method or Instruc
tion, under a law demanding assess
ment ut full value, the practical re
sult being unequal undervaluations In
almost overy County of the Stuto.
This system can not be expected to
pioduco other than Inconsistent and
Inequitable results. Thou wo havo thd
County Hoard of Equalization, thrco
members In each county, together
with a Stnte Hoard ot Equalization
consisting of four members appointed
by tlfu governor, to correct tho In
equalities brought Into existence, thru
tho work of tho assessors . It would
nppenr that vo have' sufficient mach
inery to accomplish n fair aud equit
able equalization of the property .of
I ho State, but tho great school ot
oxperlcnco has conclusively proven
ihat It does not.
Ot the officials nbovo mentioned,
IJ10 27 assPssorB nro elected by tho
lieoplu. Threo commissioners from
I'nch county, a total of 31 commission
ers throughout tho Stato aro also elec
ted by the peoplo. Tho four uiombers
of tho Board ot Equalization are ap
pointed by tho governor. Tho three
Commissioners In each county havo
power to equalize taxes within tho
county as to Individuals and can ralso
or lower tho work ot tho assessor and
his deputies. Tho State Board of
Equalization nsldo from specific duties
In the matter of assessment of Inter,
county railroads and other Inter
county public utility corporations,
etc., nro ompowered with the right to
equalize as hotwpon counties, but have
no Jurisdiction whatever as to Indi
vidual assessments and no supervision
whatever over tho work of tho asses
sors. Tho latest report of tho pros
ent Board of Equalization, that of tho
year 1914 gives a total valuation of
all property assessed at 1221,720,400,
out of which ,1G7,C71,187, was asses
sed by tho 27 assessors of the Stato
nnd their deputies and equalized by
the respective County Hoards and tho
Stato Board ot Equalization, and tho
remaining 154,049,213 was assessed
by tho Stnte Board of Equalization,
without recourse as to further equaliz
ation. In other words, four men ap
pointed by one man assess and equal
ize ono fourth of the entire valuation
of tho Stato, whllo the other throe
fourths Is assessed and equalized by
21 assessors and 81 commissioners, a
total ot 118, all elected by the peoplo
nnd Is then subjected to further equal
ization by four men appointed by one
man.
It Is not my purpose to Imputo nny
dereliction of duty to tho State Board
of Equalization, tho assessors, or the
commissioners. Undoubtedly thoy
linvo all dono the best they can, and
undoubtedly much ground has been
pained year by yenr, but the question
Is, has tho most possible been done,
nnd nro our methods the .best that
can bo adopted! One thing certain
wo have a very unequal and unjust
equalization ot property throughout
tho Stato, and It Is for the accomplish
ment of an equal and Just equaliza
tion that this artlclo Is written.
A great many of tho States now
havo permanent tax commissions. In
somo States they supplant the old
Board of Equalization, In others Ihey
aro In addition thereto, and havo cer
tain defined duties. In many ot our
neighboring States, Hoards of Equal
ization or Tax Commissioners are
mado up ot officials elected by tho
peoplo, such as tho Govornor, Secro
tnry of State, Stato Treasurer, Audit
or, Attorney General, etc. In tho State
of Washington tho Stnte Board of
Equalization Is composod of the Stnto
Auditor tho Commissioner of Public
Lands, and ono momber of tho public
servlco commission who U appointed
by the Governor.
Thu StaU'cf Ordgon has a to, com
mission consisting of Oovernor, Sec
retary of Slato, Stato Treasuror, and
two tax commissioners appointed
? m
Jointly by the threo officials Just H
named. H
Thu Stato of California has a Stato ' fl
Board ot Equalization, consisting ot H
on6 member from each Congressional B
District in tho State, elected by thu H
peoplo for a torm of four years. Call- M
fornla has given much tlmo and study afj
to the tax question and hns complied j fafj
an Interesting and Instructive volume M
on rovenuo, giving niAny citations M
from decisions of the Supremo Court 3
aud Appellate Courts affecting njve- HbfJ
mio laws. In California tho comma- 0M
tatcd systom ot taxation prevails. Tho laB
Stato Is maintained entirely from tax- tM
atlon of corporations. For tho past jjgS
(Ivo years tho common forms of prop- 11
erty, such as real estate, Improve- !
pients, etc., have not been cnlled upon
jo contribute 0110 cent to maintain tho fafj
Stato. This form of property1 Is taxed IH
entirely by tho counties aud local HB
municipalities. BB
It appears to mo that Utah will Bl
make progress by creating a Stnto B
Tax Commission, dividing tho Stato Hj
Into four districts and electing tho H
members thereof by tho people. Tho ftffl
Commission should bo given general H
supervision over County ' Assessors m
w Ith power to prescrlbo rules of 'on- Bfl
eratlon, to Insist upon uniform meth- M
eds of assessment, nnd to exact stan- H
dards of efficiency that will Insure of- fl
tlclent work. Somo method should
be devised whereby an individual can Bfl
make an appeal to the commission dl- M
rect or through a Board of County M
Equalizers In all matters effecting his BBJ
Individual taxes, together with such H
other powors as may bo deemed right BBJ
and proper,
It Is not to be presumed that tho
Governor has not, and that tuture S
Govornor will not appoint good' men, BE
but where Is tho consistency In elect-
lng a Secretary ot State and a Stato H
Auditor whojo duties nro more or M
less clerical, and an Attorney Goner-
nl whoso duty Is more or Hess advls- H
ory, and a Stato Treasurer whoso du- MM
ty Is clerical and In tho capacity of B
a custodian, whllo the four men who BBJ
havo tho right and power to pass on
$221,000,000 of tho people's property, H
who aro absolute In the assessment BBJ
of ono fourth of the property of the Ha
Stato and who can ralso or lower the VI
valuations of the other three fourths HI
at will, aro appointed by the Governor KB
of the State. Does It not appear con- Q'l
slstent and right tbat men endowed Raj
with such powers and who have the IS
handling ot the very life and broath S
ot the Stato should run the gauntlet mM
of the people. It would certainly, op- KM
pear that If there are any officials ex- IM
ceptlng United States Senators Con- IS
gressmen and the Governor, that KM
should be elected by the people, It
certainly is the State Board of'Equal- ,fJ
izatlon or members of a State 'Tax 9
