Will Take Business Out of
Hands of Consolidation
Coal Company.
The Monongah Service Company, of
| Fairmont, was granted a charter yes
I terday by the secretary of the state at
Charleston. The Incoroprators of this
new public service corporation are all
Fairmont men as follows: A. J. Col
born. A- M. Rowe. J. J. MulvehiU. J-1
F. Hare, and A. E. Thurnis. The cap
ital of this company is 5100.000 and it i
will be used to operate waterworks
! for the supply of a number of the min
ing towns along the West Fork river.
| The towns to which this company
will seek to supply water are Monon- \
i gah. Worthing^a, Ida May mine. Ev-;
; erson, Chiefton and the other small
i mining settlements along the river
! and in the Helens Run section.
j Since all the incorporators are em* j
| ployees of the Consolidation Coal com- j
pany and this company is already sup-)
! plying the water at several of the j
; places in which the new company is
to operate, it is thought that the for-1
cation of this new company is merely \
for the purpose of separating water!
business from the operating depart-!
ment of the Coal company.
But few details of the plans or the j
extent of the new corporation could ;
be learned today from the incorpora- j
tors, who stated that the details of tbe
i organiration of the new company were
i being attended to by attorney G. M.
Alexander. Mr. Alexander ba-i not re
