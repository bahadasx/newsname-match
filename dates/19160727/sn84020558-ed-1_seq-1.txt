WASHINGTON. July 2G. Creat
Britain, in granting conditional per
mission for importation of food into
Poland, has surrounded her concession
with restrictions which it is feared
here again will defeat the effort being
made by the I'nited States to get sup
plies to the starving Polish people.
Although acceding to the suggestion
that food be permitted to pass through
its distribution would be supervised by
a neutral commission, the British gov
ernment ha stipulated that in return
Ihe Austro-Herman forces occupying
the British lima under guarantee that
Poland must not take native food from
(he territory. That stipulation has
been the stumbling block in previous
negoi iuiioiis on the subject. It is un
derstood that Hermany some time ago
indicated her willingness to give such
a guarantee.
Austria never has made any puaran
tees regarding the territory she oc
cupies. Another condition on which Creat
Britain insisted is that Hermany and
Austria obligate themselves to prevent
any of the relief supplies from being
used by military forces.
Semi-official statements by the Her
man press bureau tliul (lermany tun
given full guarantees to that effect
are officially denied at the state de
partment. A search of the correspon
dence failed to UiKcloNp such guaran
tees, formal or informal, official or
unofficial, from any Herman authority,

BLACKLIST IS
PHDTESTBYU.S,
Republican A. P. Leaseu Wlrej
WAl-H ! N HTOX, July L'6. F'resident
Wilson and slate department official.i
pr-ctically have completed prepara
tion of a protest against the promul
gation of a blacklist of American
lirms under the Hritish trading witu
the enemv act. It was said today that
the communication would In- sent tt
London in the nesir future, probably
within the pcxt few days. It wid
discuss the principles involved and
will not interfere with the continu
ance of informal discussions 'between
representatives of the two govern
ments over the cases of individual
firms ini hided in the bl.n'khst.
State department officials believe
that their study of the blacklist clear
ly has proved that it injures Amer
ican films in violation of interna
tional law. Acting Secretary I'olk
talked over with President Wilson
today facts laid before him by the
firms affected, and the precedents on
which, the i'nited States will act.
It is understood here that in an
nouncing it blacklist Creat I'.rit-iin
really acted in de'erence to her allies
v -ho felt that their own merchants
were suffering and some British mer
chants were profiting through failure
of the London government to follow
the lead f the continental powers in
making indiscriminate w.'r upon all
of their enemies, commercial as well
as mihttry and upon those located in
neutral countries, as well as those
resident In (lermany Jind Austria
Hungary. The (.Hies' view of the legal aspects
of the blacklist order which protwibly
will be the basis of the parliamentary
statement to be issued soon in F-on-don
and be incorporated in the repjy
to the American protest, is under
stood to Fie an follows:
S he allies agreed to enforce Inter
national law against their enemies
and upon all their subjects withon
distinction. The continental rule ap
plied by Hermany, France, Italy and
Russia, interprets the word "enemy"
as a person of enemy origin or in
terest. Knglish and American precedents
put the emphasis on domicile. Cop
seipicntly British subjects have con
sidered they could trade with any
enemy firm domiciled in a neutral
country.

I BELIEVED TO
! HAVE PERISHED
(Special to The Repuhliian)
MIAMI, July 26. More than
two hundred and fifty Mexicans
are homeless in Miami tonight as
a result of a fire which staited at
8:40 o'clock this evening and was
only under control at midnight.
That several children perished is
generally believed. In the neigh
borhood of fifty small houses and
stores were estroyed.
The fire is thought to havte been
started, when a party of Mexi
cans who were ceiebrating, became
over enthusiastic and knocked over
a lighted lamp. Firemen claim to
have seen several children in
burning homes, but owing to the
intenseness of the heat, were un
able to rescue them. '
The entire business section of
the town was threatened at one
time. The local water supply was
inadequate, but the Miami Cop
per Company turned their supply
into the mains nd prevented the
fire from being a general con
flagration. The firemen were hampered in
their work, by the constant ex
plosion of cartridges in the homes
of the Mexicans. So far as is
known no one was hit by the fly
ing bullets. The firemen worked
on in spite of the threatening mis
sies although in constant danger
of their lives.
When the business section of
the town was threatened, dyna
mite was rushed to the scene o!
the blaze, hut the wind changing,
its use was made unnecessary.
There is much excitement in
Miami tonight. The ttrcets in tl.e
fire zone have a devastated appear
ance. Men, women and children
are sleeping in the streets. Out
side of the young children thought
to have perished there has been
no loss of life reported. The e-,
tent of the damage has not been
estimated.

niH!F., Ariz.. July 2fi More than
3(in Mexicans were made homeless by
a fire which broke out in the Mexican
ijaarter in Miami, Arizona, early to
night, according to advices received
here. The fire was under control at
midnight Mter about fiftv small build
ing! and stoii-s had been destroyed.
Firemen were awaiting for the nrins
to cool to begin a search for possible
victims. Some children were reported
missing, the firemen said.
For a time ihe business section of
Miami .ipeared to be endangered bat
a shift in the wind aided in controll
ing tl.e fire.
.Mes:. ages from Miami late tonight
said those made homeless by tin- fire
were sleeping in the streets, huddled
among scanty belongings rescued from
the buildings.
The fiie was said to have been
started by the overturning of a lamp.

BALTIMORE, July 26. The Ger
man submarine liner Deutschland to
day was cleared by her comander. Cap
tain Paul Koenig, for "Bremen or any
other port in Germany." Any hour now
' the vessel may start down Chesapeake
I bay, prepared to make a dash (or the
open sea through the Virginia capes
and the guard of allied warships off
the three mile limit.
Secrecy surrounds the plans of Cap-
j tain Koenig. After obtaining his clear-

said, in reply to questions asked for
the benefit of the Maryland Pilots' as
sociation, that the exact time of his
departure was indefinite. Tonight he
had made no arrangements for a pilot,
but he can procure one almost imme-,
diately at any time he desires.
Agents of the sub-sea freighter an
nounced this afternoon that she was
ready for the return voyage to Ger
many and that clearance papers
would be secured later in the day.
This information was conveyed to the
customs house and the offices of the
clearance clerk were kept open for Cap
tain Koenig who arrived shortly before
four o'clock, with Captain Hinsch of
the North German Lloyd liner Neckar.
After the usual formalities, the com
mander of the submarine requested
that his manifest, which he had filed,
lie withheld from publication "for a
i reasonable time."
i Collector of the Port Ryan communi
cated with the treasury department at
Washington and then Informed Cap
tain Koenig that his request would b
granted. On his way from the build
ing the little captain tarried long
enough to shake hands with several of
ficials who wished him a safe voyage.
"We certainly are with you." said
one of his well wishers, patting him on
the shoulder. Captain Koenig smiled
broadly, nodded his head, said, "I
thank you," and then continued on his
way to the pier where the Deutschland
has been tied up for more than two
weeks.
