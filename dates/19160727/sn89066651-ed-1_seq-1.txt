Von Mayes at Charleston.
Von Mayes, candidate lor the
Democratic nomination lor Sena
tor from this district, was in
Charleston yesterday in the in
terest of his candidacy. While
lie made no political speech, Mr.
Mayes got acquainted with quite
a number of voters during his
short visit, and made many
friends who will support him in
the primary and in the general
election, if he secures the nomi
nation for which he aspires.
There is no doubt that lie has the
ability to till the ollice of State

but that same was not done and,
that he had no other alternative
but to turn them over to the
county. He retained six of the
paupers, they being cither blind

We arc sorry to see this condi
tion, and believe that some ar
rangement will be made before
long to take up these warrants.
However, tho Herald will keep
its readers informed upon the
turn of events.

The above is a likeness of our president, Woodrow Wilson, the
man who has kept our country out of the great European struggle,
and who is successfully bringing about peace in Mexico. He has
completely fulfilled the party pledges since being in office, and
prosperity of the United States has been one of record since his
inauguration. Congress has fully stood by the President in every
crisis, which is sufficient to say that he has presided over the
American people as they wished. The Democratic administration
under the leadership of President Woodrow Wilson has been one
without an equal. America ranks today the leading peace power
of tho world, and is financially stronger than any three nations
combined. Why swap away a tried leader for an unknown quan
tity? We can win with Wilson. We can't win with Hughes.
To Revet River Bank.
Some of the boats of tho gov
ernment licet are here for work
on the bank above the city, and
it is probable that active work of
revetment will bo under way by
August 1.
The plan at first was for tho
Levee Board here to advance)
$150,000 and the Mississippi
River Commission to provide a
similar amount to be expended
in revetment work.
However, as the Commission
has now no available funds on
hand, the Levee Board has agreed
to put up its money at once, and
Wednesday night sent away a
check for $100,000 and will make
the other payment of 50,000
September 13. It is thought
that there will be no hitch in the
way of securing the help from
the government in due time.
Work will begin at the Dowd
crossing, coming south and the
money available will revet ap
proximately 3,000 foot. When the
complete sum of 81500,000 is e.
ponded, nearly two miles of bauk
will have been treated, thus pro
tecting the weakest section of
tho levee in this vicinity.
It is boliovqd, morovor, that,
after the work is onco begun, it
will be extended down to join
with the old revetment in front
of this city, theroby relieving two
worries which have boon felt
hero for somo years. - Carutli

Saw Mill was a caller at this of
lice Wednesday morning and
showed us a telegram stating
that his prices for the furnish
ing of the lumber and heavy tim
bers for the construction of the
oil derrick and foundations had
been accepted, and was ordered
to begin the cutting of the mate
rial at once. The telegram was
signed by the secretary of the
International Oil Association.
It further stated in the tele
! gram that they expected to have
an expert on the ground in a few
days, and that matters will be
rushed.
This oil company is formed of
a bunch of wealthy Germans
ol St. Louis and who are heavy
holders in the oil fields of South
ern Illinois, and the field mana
ger of the Association informed
us they had very flattering pros
pects for a good yield in this
vicinity.
It is hoped that every move
will be one for the benefit of
Hayti and this company. Let
our citizens join in giving them
every encouragement.

Fred L. Williams, Democratic
candidate for Judge of the Su

gentleman of worth, and a man
in whom the people can place
confidence. When elected a few
years ago, he was forced to draw
for the length of his term, and
drew the short term. He feels
that he is entitled to a regular
full length term, and pledges
that he will conduct his office if
elected to the full satisfaction of
the people. A vote for Judge
Williams will be a vote cast for a
man who is well fitted for the
office.
