HEMQKHAGE KILLS
M. C. SUTHERLAND
Was on His Way Home For a Visit
But Dies in Shawneetown, HI.,
Before Arriving Here
The death of Maurice C. Suth
erland at Shawneetown, Ills.,
Thursday morning was indeed
pathetic. He had sent his wife
and baby ahead on the train from
Kappa. III., their home and was
hurrjing through in his automo
bile to join them here on a visit
to his parents in his old home.
The exsrtion was too much for
him. he was stricken with a
hemorhage Sat. July 15th and
came near dying on the streets,
"a stranger in a strange land."
He was finally identified, by a
lodge badge he was wearing, by
telegraphing to ti.e lodge at El
I'afo, Texas, and later by mes
sages from Masonic and Rail
road fraternities at Kappa, Ills.,
his late home. It was not learn
ei until next day when he rail'ed
and regained consciousness ard
,as able to talk feebly, that his
loved ones were all so near him,
in Marion-and that his des
tination. A message reached
here at 2 o'clock Sunday after
noon telling of his plight and his
wife left on the 3 o'clock train
coir.g via Henshaw and reaching
him before night, as a car
awaited her and quickly reached
the Ohio river which was soon
crested. He seemed to rally and
was thought to be on the high
road to recovery when a second
attack, on Thursday morning
early, sapped his remaining
strength and left him loser in
the battle with grim reaper. His
remains were brought here
Thursday afternoon and taken to
the home of his parents Mr. and
Mrs. John Sutherland from which
he was given a Masonic burial
Friday afternoon at 4 o, clock in
the New Cemetery.
There were many and beauti
ful flowers. The deceased was
born June 23th 183, and was
therefore 23 yesrs and 22 days
old at the time of his dcth. He
was married Feb. 28, 1910 t o
Miss Ella Hartensower, of Ton
ka, Ills., and she ard one ion,
three years of age survive be
sides his parents and two broth
ers, John of Cedar Rapids. Iowa,
and Ira of Phoenix, Ariz., and 3
sisters, Mrs. NelKe Calvin of
Hickman, Ky.. and Be mice and
Mabel of this city.
Honoring Mrs. Fiank Edwards
of Gilbert, Minn.. Mrs. Harold

tap The guests included Misses

Lemah James of Louisville. Mes

wards and Wilbur Haynes.
At the charming lawn fete
Monday evening given on the
grounds of the really massnificent
Hay ward estate in honor of the
birthday of Madam Escott there
quite unexpectedly appeared an
other celebrant in the form of
Mr. Geo. M. Crider.
Hastily gathering up two ci
gar?, one of our most charming
society women of Marion pre-
1 a an fa 4 iVam aa o ViiVi1 rrlff t i
Mr. Cr'der stating at the time
that she pave two because i n
Scripture or somewhere else is
stated that one thi-uld not be
alone.
Several people stsndig near,
said that Mr. Crider really blush
ed, hut an insurance agent blush
ing is inconceivable.
It is more likely the rays of an
electric light flashing through
the eye of one of the so
ciety ladies? rested on his face a
moment.
The question arose last even
ing as to why there were not
three tirthdav entrants in
stead of two. Mrs. Wila.-n has
not had to our knowledge a birth
day since she was twenty years
old. It is o f course possible
that she may be now thirty one
but she does not look it. Visitor
