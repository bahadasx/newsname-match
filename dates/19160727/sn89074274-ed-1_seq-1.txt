Valley City has, a first-class, chance
to get the big Equity packing plant if
the farmers of the county will show
that they are interested. Much has al
ready been done to impress the Equity
leaders with the fact that we want it.
The other cities after the enterprise
realize that our chances are exception
ally good and they know why we have
this chance. The Minot Optic-Report
er places it squarely before the people
when it says: "At Valley City there
is a united movement by the farmers
and business men to get the location
Both are working hand in hand to ac
complish the desired results."
The location of the plant here will
mean dollars in the pocket of every
farmer in the county. It will mean
more profit on their stock it will
mean a bigger market, for every ar
ticle of produce they raise it will
mean a better city and county, and an
increased valuation for their land.
They have nothing to lose and much
to gain by showing $,hat they are in
terested.
The Equity committee is to meet
here Saturday to make its decision as
to the location of the plant. Every
farmer and business man of the county
ought to be here that day to meet the
committee. Pass this word along to
your neighbor—he may possibly not
have paid particular attention to the
matter, and his presence and your
presence may possibly turn the scale
in favor of Valley City.
The Minot paper further sums up
the situation, which is clearly seen to
be in Valley City's favor: "It would
not be surprising if the fight narrowed
down to Valley City and Minot. Fargo,
it is contended is and always has been
contended by the farmers is too near
the jaws of the big packing industries
in the twin cities. It would place the
stock raisers in the grip of those con
cerns because there wsuld be little
competition in the buying market and
none in the selling market. The farm
ers of that section of the state are not
enthusiastic for its location there, real
izing that while immediate location
would be some local advantage, there
would be enough differences in the
conditions to more than offset the ad
vantages."
IF YOUR OWN PROSPERITY IS A
MATTER OF INTEREST TO YOU
YOU SHOULD BE ON HAND SATUR
DAY WITHOUT FAIL.

Dedication Is One of
Nome's Biggest Days
Nome Tribune: The dedication ex
ercises of the high school buuilding!
Thursday turned out to be probably
one of the biggest days that Nome has
ever had. The weather man was good
and gave us exceptionally fine weath
er during the whole day, and the crowd
was larger than any of those in charge
anticipated, the assembly room being
packed both afternoon and evening.
It is hard to say just how many there
were there, but at supper there were
somewhere near 550 fed by the ladies.
The afternoon program started a lit
tle after 2 and was opened by a song
by the. school and followed by an in
vocation by the Rev. N. I. Berg, Mayor
E. M. Lee delivering a short address
of welcome, Prof. Eugene Woodhams,
dean of the conservatory of music
at the Valley City Normal, rendered
two vocal selections and both were
greatly appreciated by the audience.
W. E. Hoover, city superintendent of
the Fargo schools, delivered a very
interesting address and complimented
the people of the community very
highly on the successful culmination
of their plans and school building.
Miss Adolpha Hedstrum, of Valley
City, rendered several violin selec
tions and was called back several
times by the audience. The dedica
tion address was delivered by Deputy
State Superintendent W. E. Parsons
and was followed by a school song and
the audience singing America.
The ladies of the community are to
be highly complimented on their work
and upon the supper that they served
to the crowd after the afternoon pro
gram. There were somewhere be
tween 500 and 550 served there during
the evening and everywhere you could
hear people complimenting the supper
served, and it sure was some feed.
The evening program was opened
by two songs by the school, followed
by an address by O. A. Barton, field
deputy. Miss Adolpha Hedstrum again
rendered several selections on the vio
lin and was again greeted with the
same enthusiasm that was displayed
In the afternoon. The primary* and
intermediate grades were very pretty
in their Japanese song, and F. T.
Goodier gave a very interesting talk
which held the attention of the audi
ence throughout. The Valley City
male quartet were on the program for
two selections,,,but before the end
they had sung several selections, en
core after encore calling them back.
Minnie J.' Nielson presented a grad
uating class of ten, one of the largest
classes of the county this year, with

Fats and Leans Stage
Six Innings of Comedy
Monday evening at the ball grounds
north of the city the fats and leans put
on a six inning game of alleged base
ball.
The fact that the proceeds went to
augment the fund for playgrounds
made everybody overlook the acts of
omission and commission of those en
gaged as players.
When you speak of this ball game
being a treat you are only expressing
it mildly. Everyone present seemed
to thoroughly enjoy the hour and a
half at the field, it being a question as
to whether the players or the specta
tors enjoyed the game the more. The
contest was keen throughout and re
plete with stellar ball. Many features
might be mentioned, one of which was
the brilliant steal and slide of Chief
Swanson to second base. Another the
long run and catch of Mr. Hilburn in
the left garden. The batting of Mr.
Bonhus with a three-bagger and Mr. Mc
Culloch should not be slighted. Mayor
Moe was right there when it came to
cutting them off at first. The lelan
team was perhaps a little better bal
anced than that of their opponents
which to a great extent accounts for
the score.
The time of the game undoubtedly
prevented many from getting out to
see the game but those who were there
were very liberal in setting their own
price and $21.95 was taken in. Most
sincere thanks is extended to the play
ers and the others present for backing
the project.
Following is the lineup and score:
Fats Hilborn, Bemis, McCulloch,
Bonhus, Rodewald, Johnson, Moe, E.
Swanson, Jones.
Leans—Purdy, Vic Swanson, Nelson,
Thorkelson, Smith, Palmer, Johnson,
Goodier, Brown.
Score by innings:
Fats 3 03000—6
Leans 6 2 0 2 1 x—11
class upon the fact that there had
been provisions made for them to fin
ish high school at home and recom
mended that they should take advan
tage of the possibilities that have been
provided for them.
During the afternoon and evening
could be heard exclamations of ad
miration from everyone at the build
ing /and spacious grounds that have
been provided and everyone will have
the feeling more deeply imbedded in
their -nfinds that Nome can and will
do things for its development.

Oriska Defeats Fast
Buffalo Aggregation
For the first time in several years
Oriska defeated the fast Buffalo nine
last Sunday in a well played game by
a 'score of 4 to 1. Both teams played
a very good game, Oriska having them
shut out till the eighth inning in which
Easton, of Buffalo, hit a single into
right field, the ball stopping in tall
weeds and was not found until he had
crossed the home plate. Ordinarily the
hit would have gqne only for a single.
This saved the Buffalo boys from a
shutout. Thorson, on the mound for
Oriska, pitched giltedge ball, he allow
ing only five hits and getting nine
strikeouts. The feature of the game
was a long running catch by Ploof in
the eighth inning. This game gives
Oriska its sixth victory out of nine
games .played this season.

Hoiland Brings Action
for Patent Infringements
Fargo, July 23. Albert Hoiland,
through his attorneys, Fowler & Green,
has served notice on Aasheim & Son
that they cease manufacturing and
selling the Aasheim wild oats separa
tor, which Hoiland alleges is an in
fringement of his patents in eight dif
ferent particulars. Unless Aasheim
& Son cease making this machine Hoi
land will hold them liable for dam
ages, he claims.
Hoiland some time ago invented aj
separator which takes the wild oats by
means of a flannel cloth over which
the grain is made to run. He patented
this machine and the parts of it. The
separator has proven a success and is
meeting with great demand. It is
claimed that Aasheim & Son are using
the same flannel process in their ma
chine. Hoiland has patented this pro
cess and claims that his patent is be
ing infringed upon.

At the annual convention of the
United Spanish War Veterans, depart
ment of Minnesota, which was recently
held at Albert Lea, Minn., O. G. Sand
stad, a member or Company G, of Val
ley City, that served in the Philippines,
was elected department commander.
A part of the report of the convention
is taken from the Freeborn County
Standard, and is as follows:
"The annual, convention of the
United Spanish War veterans, de
partment of Minnesota, closed here
Tuesday night with a big dance and
entertainment for the visitors at the
Casino. A large proportion of the
delegates had left for home, but
there were enough left to make a
merry night of it.
"The sessions of Monday arid Tues
day were taken up with the various
details and routine matters of the
various camps. Business of import
ance was transacted, but it is im
possible to print the minutes at this
time because they have to be ap
proved by the senior council first.
"The election, which was held Tues
day afternoon, resulted in the election
of O. G. Sandstad, of Kenyon, Minn.
"The new commander has had a dis
tinguished war record. As a member
®of Co. G, First N. D. regiment, he saw
service in the Philippines. He has
been an active member of the veter
ans' association ever since its found
ing in this state and has held many of
its important offices. He was clerk
of Leut. Gov. Burnquist during the
past two sessions of the state legisla
ture. The new commander was pre
sented with a gavel by Wm. U. Shields,
of Pipestone, the instrument being
made from the famous rock taken from
that place."
Mueller Defense Rests in
Jamestown Murder Case
Jamestown, July 24.—District court
closed Saturday evening with the
cross examination of Dr. Coulbert,
formerly of the North Dakota state
hospital for the insane.
The state's contention is that if
John Mueller was taken with epileptic
fits, following the insulting remark of
Valentine Hins, he would not have
shot the family the way he did, be
cause of the convulsions and motor in
activity caused by the fits. But the
witness attempted to bring out the
fact that there is a sort of mental or
psychic epilepsy which attacks a per
son and causes him to be insane sev
eral minutes before he^s taken with
the convulsions. It is this kind of
epilepsy that the defense claims John
Mueller was suffering with when he
committed the crime.
Monday morning at 9:30 court
convened and Dr. Peake was called
upon the stand. He testified that the
defendant in this case had mental or
psychic epilepsy as far as he could
judge from examinations of the per
son, and assuming the testimony of
the witnesses for the defense to be
true.
The state rsted at 3:15 p. m. and
the long trial appeared drawing to an
end with the closing arguments of
counsel.

Pioneer Foster County Man
Passes Away in Washington
Carrington, July 20.—Geo. H. Esta
brook, one of Carrington's grand old
men and pioneer citizens, died Monday
at North Yakima, Wash., where he has
been making his home the past two
years with his son, Albert. He has
been in poor health most of the time
since he went west, but had been some
better of late and was planning to re
turn to Carrington within a few weeks.
A brief wire was received here Tues
day announcing the death and stating
that the body would be taken to Chip
pewa Falls, Wis., for burial beside the
bodies of Mrs. 'Estabrook and son, Lou.
Mr. Estabrook was one of the ear
liest settlers of this region and one of
its most prominent citizens. He was
universally respected for many sterl
ling qualities. Although nearly 86
years old, he was gifted to the end
with an unusually bright mind and
was a fluent and most interesting talk
er.
He was an attorney by profession
and during his residence in Foster
county held the offices of state's at
torney and judge of probate. He was
also at one time editor of the Inde
pendent. Mr. Estabrook was a char
ter member of the Masonic lodge in
Carrington.
Mr. Estabrook was born Oct. 5, 1830,
at Springfield, 111. He was nearly 86
years old.
In the Civil war, Mr. Estabrook
went early, joining the Seventh Illi
nois infantry. He served his country

Bismarck, July 23.—No gloom pre
vailed at the departure of the First
Regiment yesterday for the border.
Friends and relatives saw them off,
but no handkerchiefs wiped tears
away. The boys cheered as the spec
ials started on their journey to Mex
ico and those that assembled to see
them off did likewise.
It was a different scene from that
when the companies left to mobilize.
Then there was every indication of
an immediate bloody conflict with the
southern republic. Peace prospects
made yesterday's departure seem
more like an enthusiastic sendoff to
a booster train. The militiamen show
ed clearly that the long-awaited orders
to move brought joy to their hearts.
Some of the officers who served in the
Spanish-American war inwardly smiled
at the attitude of the troops. It will be
a different story, they said, after a
few months in the tropics.
Only one sad happening marred the
leave-taking, the sudden death of Mrs.
Alice Nelson Page, of Grand Forks,
mother of Sergeant Dike Page of the
machine gun company of that city.
Her death is believed to have been
caused by the shock of her son's im
mediate departure. Mrs. Page was the
proprietor of the Page Printery. The
immediate cause of her death was
hemorrhage of the brain. Sergeant
Page received word Friday that his
mother was seriously ill and left for
Fargo. When he arrived there he re
ceived a wire that she was all right
and started back to camp, but had not
gone far before he was handed a mes
sage from Col. Fraine, telling of his
mother's death and ordering him. to go
home and to join the company at Oma
ha.
The First battalion left at 6:30 the
Second at 8:45, and the Third a few
minutes before midnight.
The regiment commenced to break
camp at noon. Orders were first is
sued to entrain at 2 o'clock, but the
engine crews were not ready to move.
Each soldier when he entrained car
ried his own little bundle of belong
ings. Full equipment, even to cots,
mosquito bars and mess tables, was
sent with the regiment. Not a slice
of bread nor a stick of wood was left
on the camp site. The boys carried
everything to the fires and burned it.
The only evidence last night that it
had been a camp was the bare spots
left whete holes had been dug for the
camp fire and the company refrigera
ter. "The sanitary condition of the
camp at all times was ideal," said
Adjutant General Tharaldson, last
night, after a final inspection. "The
fact that so many men lived in the
camp for about a month without any
sickness is remarkable."
Recruiting will continue, but it has
not been decided yet whether a new
regiment will be formed or the "rook
ies" will be sent south to join the
First. The active recruiting will be
done by three commissioned officers,
three sergeants, three corporals and
three privates. These men will be ap
pointed at once and will be stationed
in different parts of the state.
"It is probable that the new re
cruits will be sent at once to Fort
Lincoln and trained there for some
time, even if a new regiment is not
formed," said General Tharaldson last
night. "Everything is in fine shape.
The camp has an abundance of good
water and is almost an ideal place for
summer mobilization."
Lost Boys Found With
Relatives at Nome
Fargo, July 24.—Henry Skaar, 20,
son of Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Skaar of

When they failed to show up Satur
day, their friends became alarmed,
and notified the local police.
