When the fact is taken into con
sideration that Wood county is the
largest in point of nrca, wealth and
population of the five counties com
prising the 13th Congrcssfonal Dis
trict, and that it has had but one con
gressman sixty years ago in its
history, is it any wonder that the Re
publicans of Wood county are united
in putting forth every endeavor to
nominate the Hon. Franklin P. Riegle,
of Howling Green, for member of Con
'gress ?
Outside of "booming" a few local
candidates for county office, The
Leader has never engaged very active
ly in political affairs of a wider scope
until during this campaign and then
it is because we admre the man who
aspires to 'represent the district as
Congressman Franklin P. Riegle.
The editor did not know Mr. Riegle
very well until he made an address at
the regimental reunion held in Pcm
berville a year ago this fall. That
speech touched a tender chord. It
FRANKLIN P. RIEGLE
proved conclusively that the speaker
was a patriot. Further, a goodly por
tion of that speech was directed main
ly to the boys and girls of our high
school, who attended in a body, and
the lesson they there received is of in
estimable value a fact which we
know personally.
Mr. Riegle is a lawyer a capable
one. He is clean and has never been
mixed up in "dirty" cases. He believes
in a square deal policy, and thinks his
fellowman is his equal. His record as a

Republican is above l-eproach. Ho has
never been off the track. He's a self
made man, huving made every dollar
ho possesses by work and hard work
and close application, at that. The
newspapers of Wood county are
united in declaring for Mr. Riegle, a
feature that is remarkable.
At a meeting of the Republican
Central and Executive Committees of
Wood county, held on the 3d day of
July, 191G, the following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
RESOLUTION.
Whereas, The Republicans of Wood
county recognize the attainments of
Hon. Franklin P. Riegle as a speaker
and as a thinker who has" given pro
found study to governmental affairs
as they affect the prosperity of the
country and the welfare of its citi
zenry; and
Whereas,. His fellow citizens of
Wood county know him as a clean,
honest and patriotic citizen whose
loyalty to friends and to the Repub
lican party have always met the test
of willingness to undergo personal in
convenience .and expenditure of time
and money; and,
Whereas Wo realize that to win
in the Thirteenth District of Ohio,
Republicans must present to the voters
a man who will personally appeal to
the various elements of our re-united
party; therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Wood County Re
publican Executive and Central Com
mittees, in joint session assembled,
this 3d day of July, 191G, that we most
heartily and earnestly commend 'Mr.
Riegle to the consideration of the Re
publican voters of the District and
urge each to work for his nomination
at the primaries August 8th as one
who would meet every requirement of
loyalty to his country and his constitu
ency, and who would uphold the hands
of Charles E. Hughes as President of
the United States and help restore to
American citizenship the fruits of
their labors and the opportuiuty for
the profitable and enjoyable pursuit
of their chosen vocations.

TRAVELING MANJS EXPERIENCE
"In the summer of 1888 I had a very
severe attack of cholera morbus. Two
physicians worked over mo from four
a. m. to 0 p. m. without giving mo any
relief and then told me they did not
expect mo to live; that I had best tele
graph for my family. Instead of do
me; so, I Rave tho hotel porter fifty
cents and told him fo buy mo a bottle
of Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy, and tako no sub
stitute. I took a double dose according
to tho directions and went to sleep
after tho second dose. At five o'clock
tho noxt morning I was cnllcd by my
order and took a trnin for my next
stopping point, a well man but feeling
rather shaky from tho severity of tho
attack," wrftoa H, W. Iroland, Louis

The campaign for tho sale of
Chautauqua tickets is growing
hotter and a goodly number of
ticket purchasers have been added
to this week's list but there are
still a large number of season
tickets to be sold yet before the
S00.00 of guarantee is made up.
This week a systematic effort, by
moans of a house to house canvas
is being made by tho guarantors
to meet the required amount. The
men who are responsible for bring
ing tho Chautauqua to Perrysburg
are hot expecting to make any
money but are satisfied if the
Chautauqua will "pay out."
A Chautauqqua is not intended
for any special class but the farm
er, business man, the laborer and
the professional man will alike en
joy and benefit themselves by at
tending. At 12 o'clock Saturday
noon the sale of course tickets will
stop and no season tickets will be
sold after the ticket office opens
at 1 :30 on Saturday. You must
act quickly if you would have sea
son tickets. There are only two
days left. The committee has
brought this line, great proposi
tion to Perrysburg, believing that
its citizens would appreciate it.
They- need your patronage, and
they need it "right now," and you
Mr. Citizen of town and township,
should show your appreciation by
seeing that the Chautauqua, by
your patronage and "boosting,"
does break even financially.

Help us get the remaining $308.'

DIARRHOEA QUICKLY CURED
"About two years ngo I had a severe
attack of diarrhoea which lasted for
over a week," writes W. C. Jones, Bu
ford, N. D. "I became so weak that I
could not stand upright. A druggist
recommended Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. The
first doso relieved mo and within two
days I was as well ns evor," For sale
by nU dqalora,
Judging poultry is .said to be a
finer art than the selection of other
farm animals, but tho man or wom
an who picks pullets with a fine head
with alert eyes and comb, face and
wattles of fine texture has taken the
first step towards egg production.
Good pullets should stand square
on their feet, with legs wide apart,
with front end of the body slightly
higher than the posterior end, and
with a long back and tail carried
rather high. The body should be
wedge shaped, yielding ample
room for the reproductive and di
gestive organs.
Shade is regarded as one of the
important items in the care of the
flock for the summer. When the
hot days come on many poultry
breeders transfer the hens and
young chickens to tho orchard or
woodlot. Where shade is not avail
able, a temporary structure G by 10
feet and 4 feet high is erected; this
is covered with burlap or canvas.
An 'ideal place for young fowls is '
near the edge of a corn field where J
they can' have shade, scratching'
places and can find many insects.
When is the best time to sell
hogs? In studying the average
prices paid for swine since 18(JG
Jesse Whonsetler, a student, found
that two periods of the year were
distinctly favorable for securing the
best market price. These are dur
ing the early part of April and dur
ing the early part of September.
At other times the average prices
run much lower, reaching the low
est mark in November. The aver-
ago September price was SG.90 per
hundred pounds, the April price
SG.G5 and the November price $5.50
It is evident that swine raisers se
cure the most profit when they sell
their hogs near the high periods.
