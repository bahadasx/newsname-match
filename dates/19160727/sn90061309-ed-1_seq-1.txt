MONROE CITY DEMOCRAT
Volume XXIX.
Monroe City, Mo., Thursday, July 27, 1916.
Number 17
Williims A Winner
Judge Fred L Williams is making
a splendid showing in his rare (or
the Democratic nomination fur
Judge of Division No. 2 of the
Supreme Court (unexpired term).
This is not surprising to his many'
friends who have known him and
kept in touch with his career. From
a farmer boy, in early life, without j
financial backing, he worked his :
way through college and law school,
coining out the honor mun of his
class. Upon finishing law school '
he located at Jopliu, where by his
own efforts he arose to the top of
the Jasper county bar. Three years ,
and a hulf ago. when the Supreme ;
Court whs looking over the state
for a man to appoint upon the
Supreme Court Coinission to aid
the court in writing opinions and
relieve the orercrowded condition
of the Supreme Court docket. Judge
Williams was selected by the court
from a list of more than thirty ap
plicants. So sntislactorily did he
perform his work that he was again
elected by the unanimous vote of
the seven judges for another term
- as a comissioner. He is forty years
of age, stands six feet three and is
as large mentally as he is physically.
He is energetic and has written his
full share of opinions since he has
been sitting with the supreme Court.
He possesses a rare judicial temper
anient and a great career is pre
dicted for him on the bench.
His only opponent is from the
city of St Louis. That city already
has two out of the seven Supreme
Judges, while Judge Williams'
sectiou of the State has none.
Williams is not runuin; against
any of the present members of the
Supreme Court.
We are of the opinion that the
Democratic voters of the State will
encounter little difficulty in arrivin g
at a choice in this race.
A dollar brings you the Demo
crat one year.
The Democrat appreciate the
courtisies extended by Wade and
Dawson this week.

It was our pleasure to ee an
album of photographic prints pre
pared by Miss Bell Johnson at the
request of the Bausch and Lomb
Optical Company, of Rochester, N.
Y, for their exhibit at the National
Convention, showing what can be
done with the Lessar lens.
If you believe that congress is
only for the purpose of giving some
man a job we can easily see why
you should vote for Lozier, but if
.you believe there is work to be done
you will certainly vote for Rurker
as you want the man elected who
can do the greatest good for his
constituents and you know Rucker
is' that man.
Youth Drowns While In Pool At

day afternoon about 3 o'clock fifteen
boys were enjoying a swim in a
creek near Mohawk In the crowd
were Jumes and Russell Flanagan,
two sons of Mr and Mrs T P. Flan

be experienced swimmers.
Two strange men in a car passed
the swimming hole and the boys
commenced to shout and raise con- pre8erved by tne pe,ple 1)f tne

farmer and Joe another brother
arrived on the scene. The two
brothers commenced diving for the
body, but it was fully an hour later
before they surceded in bringing it
to the surface and then for another
hour the pulaiotor was used in a
vain endeavor to bring life back to
the little lad
The accident occured where the
creek deepens in entering a shallow
coat pit until a maximum of
eighteen feet is reached. The theory
of the drowning is that the boy
went into the water in a heated
condition and was suddenly at
tacked by cramps Not one of the
fifteen boys in the pool beard him
cry or saw him go down under the
water. He was one of twelve
children of Mr and Mrs. Flanagan
and this was the first death to
occur in the family.
The time for holding) the funeral
services had not been definitely
fixed eurly Monday morning, but
it is probable they will be held at
9 o'clock Tuesday morning from
the Holy Family Catholic, church.
Mr. and Mrs Flanagan are well
known in this community and their
many friends regret to hear of
their sad berievement.

An Electric Storm
Wednesday afternoon of last
week the country north of Monroe
City was visited by quite an electric
storm. The rain fell in torrents
and the lightning was severe. The
George Howe house was struck and
the telephone torn from the wall.
At John Lake's furin the storm
was so severe that the men sought
shelter but they did not realize it
was so violent until his son Harold
when he went for the cows at milk
ing time, found seven dead under n
large tree. Another was badly
injured Four others in the pasture
were unharmed As the stock was
not insured it was quite a loss and
while they regret it they feel that
they have much to be thankful for
that they escaped personal injury .
Just across the road from the
Like farm Mr Rathburnhad ashed
damaged.
Mrs. Lambert Hagan entertained
forty ladies Wednesday morning in
honor of her guest, Mrs. D. A Yow
ell, of Virginia. III. The house was
tastefully decorated with sweet peas
and nasturtiums and as the guests
arrived they were served with de
licious punch Six hand euchre was
the entertainment. The hostess
served ice cream and cake.
What sensible man is there
among you who having a good
faithful hired man who had done
more good for you than any man
you had ever before hired and was
doing more go work than any of
your neighbors hired men were do-
mi!, would turn that man off and
lure an inexperienced man, a man
you know but little about just he
cause the stronger came along and
asked for job? There are none of
you who would do such a blunder
ing thing. Congressmen are em
ployed to work for the people. If
the 'offline was established to give
some one- a job, then every two
years a new man should be elected.
This district has tried the short
terms and failed to get good service.
It is thus in every case. Get a
good man like Rucker and keep
him there and then the people get
good service.
