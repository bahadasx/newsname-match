their nights ticks.
Not a car moved in Yonkers, Mount

ORGANIZE SQUAD
OF RESERVES AT
POLICE STATION
Men in Turn-Will Be Called
upon tov serve. Jiixxra
Eight Hours.
A reserve squad of four members
of the police department to be sta
tioned at headquarters for eight hours
previous to doing patrol duty was
formed today and Superintendent J.
H. Redgate announced that every man
on patrol duty will be called upon
to do reserve duty in turn. '
The room for the reserve squad
has been fitted up on the third floor
the police building in the room
formerly used by the board of - health
as i a, dental clinic. Four beds have
been ' placed in the room, and will be
occupied for three shifts a day.
The idea of holding some of the
men in reserve has been contemplated
for . some time but the need of the
force has been doubly shown since
poliomyelitis has appeared here and
regular policemen have been taken
from patrol duty ' and placed at pri
vate dwellings to enforce quarantine.
By the arrangement now in effect
six men always will be 'In reserve.
Since the recent addition of new pa
trolmen, two men have been kept in
reserve and with the four others, it is
believed that the force will be large
enough to cope with any emergency
that may arise and N.preclude the ne
cessity of Calling the regular patrol
men from the beats. '
In ordr to ha,vexthe full number of
men on patrol duty, two men from the
First precinct and one each from the
Second and Third precincts will report
at headquarters with the platoon
which precedes theirs on duty. They
will go to i the reserve room and re
main there until called upon to act
in ca.se of necessity. . .
As the beds have been" placed in the
room, the men may sleep there if they
wish.. The beds will probably be oc
cupied for the three shifts as are
many in rooming houses,
The original intention was to have
the men do . reserve duty after re
turning from patrol but the superin
tendent and the commissioners believ
ed that they would be too tired in
case a sudden call came in before
the men would have a chance to get
seme sleep, so it was decided to have
them do the reserve&uty first.
The room for the emergency hos
pital night dector has been changed
and instead of -being on the second
floor will be adjoining the reserve
room. The alterations to the building
which have been decided upon by the
cemmissioners will be started in the
near future. President J. C. Stanley
stated today that he would be unable
to state' definitely when they, would
start. '

SCHOOLS TO BE KEPT
CLOSED THREE WEEKS
UNDER HEALTH ORDER
Dr. Sophian Believes Unless 4 Unexpected Improvement
. Takes -Place, the Reopening of Schools Would Be
Perilous to Children In This Neighborhood-rOne New
Case. Added to Segregated Hospital Department in!
Hillside Home Garbage Accumulation Continues
Phyisicians' Reports to Be Checked Up.
Unless the' epidemic of infantile paralysis in New Yorl
and vicinity -dies ou very suddenly, Bridgeport's schools
won't be opened in September,according,; to Dr. Abraham So
phian, the health expert who is
here.
"As long as there js any danger,"
said Dr. Sophian this afternoon, "we
shall enforce regulations for the pro
tection of the community." As the con
gregation of children, while the epi
demic is raging, is contrary to the
recommendations' of the Bridgeport
board of health,vthe board will dis
courage gathering of children until all
peril has passed. '
"It is hard to tell, just now, what
will happen," said the expert. "The
epidemic got such an early start that
we are hopeful it may die out by the
first days of September. . From the
history of epidemics, however, this
seems unlikely. f t
. "While there Is any poliomyelitis
around here, the general safeguards
for health will be Insisted upon by the.
department. It may be necessary to
postpone the opening of schoois about
three weeks." ,
An important development In the
situation here today, .which will have
an effect permanently, was the .an
nouncement of Dr. Sophian that here
after the health department will
check up every death in the city for
the purpose of confirming or disprov
ing the physician's record on the
death certifiicate. . .
."The only purpose of a. death cer
tificate is to certify , that a person
came to his death by a certain means.
We shall check up every physician's
report on a death."
- The importance of this may be
Judged from the fact that there has
RVtrVben ny -check 4 before on
death , certificates. The attending
physiciafn's signed statement has been
accepted. .
Dr. . Sophian was greatly surprised
- J - neVtfbeen '-hxtr eheek 4 before
lyesterday v when he :' learned . that
deaths and their causes have not been
reported to the health department. He
got busy immediately to find, out the
reason why. He learned that vital eta.
tlstics are recordedat the town clerk's
office. Inspector C. Howard Dunbar
told him the health department didn't
get them until the end of every month
when they weVe.sent for. At the town
clerk's office this morning it was said
a report is made the health depart
ment every week.
The expert learned that a state law
requires filing- vital statistics In the
town clerk's office and that an effort
for the transfer wa -defeated In 'the
last' session .of the Legislature, Alter
conferences with Mayor Wilson and
others, he announced this morning
that a daily report will be received at
the health, department of deaths and
their 1 reported causes -and eah one
will be checked up. - ' --
' "They really should come here,," he
said. "We should have a report of
every case. It is a poor method to
know that a child has been ill, but not
to know pf its death." "I

the city have not been reporting con
