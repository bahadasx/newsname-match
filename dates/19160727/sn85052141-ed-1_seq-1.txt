Select your drug store with the care that you select
your doctor.
Choose that drug store that puts every transaction
between itself and its customers on a service basis.
Trade at the drug store that pays more attention to
making a customer than to making a sale.
Trade at the drug store where you can be sure that
you are getting the most and the best for your money.
Trade at the drug store where you can "feel at home.
Where you can feel at liberty to make use of all the
resources a real drug store peculiarly has for your help,
convenience and accommodations. .
It this kind of a drug store that we take pride in
running. You know a drug store i3 different from a
grocery store, a hardware store or any other kind of a store.
The relations between a druggist and his customers
are akin to those between a doctor and his palient3.
The moment a druggist forgets this fact he ceases to
be a real druggist, .
Wa want you to make use of all the advantages our Service
holds out to you. t
We kre always ready to refund your money without question or
qufbble on any purchase you may make here that is not perf etiy
satisfactory to you in every respect.
