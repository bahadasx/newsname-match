convict labor in Georgia since the pro- ti<J
liibitiou Jaw became effective, brought uli
a most iatresting and important statenieut
from Supervisor Corley with re- liel
feience to the local situation here, "i (,<!
aiu experiencing tiie same troubble zls
right now," broke in Suitervisor Corley. ,-at
"A year ago i had eighty-one convicts l,n
on my two chain gangs and now I have ,-?l
only 43, hardly enough to operate one
chain gang; and unless more convicts ^
come my way i will be forced to put 1,01
all of the convicts together. At present ult'
I am operating two gangs?one a short- l,ul
term gang, the other for the long-term

great for me to keep it up unless there e'v
he a change aiul 1 will he forced to wor t0
atl the men under the same guards," '"e
he said.
Engineer Scales said that it had al-. ,nu
ways been a matter of surprise to him <
why the Government spent millions of sty
dollars for its rivers and harbors and
not aceut on its highways. "Why there (-'i(
is at least a thousand persons travel- or
ling the highways to one the rivers and l,ul
harbors; and it can readily oe seen that !
; the roads should come in for liberal *-lt
consideration In my opinion the Gov- ,ui
t eminent will now turn its attention to
; the roads with the happy result tht in k'U)
: a few more years every travel roadwax
i in the country will be the same as Main 's 1
. Street of Lexington," concluded the en- to
i gineer, as he got in his car bound for its
Agusta and Atlauta.
L' Engineer Scales took occasion to 1
praise the splendid efforts of Gommis- l'iv
. siouer Watson, who, he said, hus done tiu
more fur the State than any other man, S01
i so far as putting enthusiasm into roads
building goes. Col Watson's work in

that outlaw band in that section

lowers ae being pursued relent less] v.
dispatches which are meager, say a
ivily amed and well-mounted detachnt
has been detailed fo the especial
[wse of capturing the bandit leuder.
utinuiug, it is stated because of his
ent hard riding, Villa's injured leg
es him geat pain which causes him
cry out frequeently. No surgeon be;
available, he has been foced to lance
himself seveal times recently, with
le knives to alleviate the pain.
Jeneral Trevino issued a formal
dement denying American reports

Gen Luis Cabaiieros uau oeeu apiuted
to supersede him.
Shipments of ore have beeu resumed
