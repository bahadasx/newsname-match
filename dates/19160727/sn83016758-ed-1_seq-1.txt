WHAT AJRMLECE
J. D. Clarkson of Carthage, Mo., Des-
ignates the Jefferson Highway
in Northern Minnesota.
It Costs $9.00 Per Mile For the
Blessed Privilege of Construct-
ing the Same.
The Union has no fault to find with
the route in Northern Minnesota
designated by Mr. J. D. Clarkson of
Carthage, Mo., as the Jefferson High
way. It runs as follows: From Elk
River to East St. Cloud, Little Falls,
Staples, Wadena. Park Rapids,
Bemidji, Thief River Falls and St.
Vincent. But what have those towns
gained by Mr. Clarkson's designation,
or what would Princeton, Milaca,
Brainerd and the other towns have
gained had the eastern route been
chosen Mr. Clarkson will not provide
one dollar for the construction of the
road in question. The local civil
divisions, the state, and perhaps the
United States, must contribute the
means, and neither Mr. Clarkson nor
any member of the Jefferson Highway
association can influence the appro
priating of a single dollar by any civil
subdivision, by the state or by the
nation. Mr. Clarkson has, after all
the fuss and feathers and hullabaloo
graciously named the route along the
above mentioned towns the Jefferson
Highway, but on these conditions:
1. One of the conditions required
by the Jefferson Highway association
of the territory awarded the highway
will be that the territory at once be
organized by the selection of county
committees of seven persons to each
county as provided for by the consti
tution and by-laws of the association,
and this shall be accomplished within
sixty days from the date of this
award.
"2 That the assessment of nine
dollars per mile shall be collected and
paid into the treasury of the associa
tion, one-half within thirty days and
the other half within sixty days of
the date of this award.
"3. That the territory covered by
this award between St. PauJ and the
boundary shall support the official
'publication of the Jefferson Highway
association, known as the Jefferson
Highway Declaration, to as great an
extent approximately in advertising
and subscriptions as other territories
of similar extent. Also, at the proper
time be inaugurated a campaign for
securing memberships to the associa
tion under the direction and with the
assistance of the association.
"4. That the actual construction of
a 365 day road throughout the entire
territory named shall proceed with as
great rapidity as is being accomplished
in the average of the territory cov
ered by the entire highway.
"It is understood and agreed that in
tne event that if the territory named
hereafter to be known as the official
h.ghway shall pay in the mileage as
required by the association, and fail
ii some othe'r requirements of the
association to such an extent that the
highway is awarded to some other
territory after one year, and before
two years have elapsed, the one-half
the mileage assessment that may
have been paid into the association
treasury will be refunded to parties
paying same. But if two years shall
have elapsed and the award of the
highway shall be withdrawn from the
territory hereafter named, through
some failure of said territory to do the
things required, then there shall be no
ebate of said assessment.
"In awarding the decision for the
Jefferson highway to the towns here
after named, it is not awarded fee
but more in a form of a license. The
Jefferson Highway association retain
ing the right to change the route pro
vided the towns to which it is awarded
do not combine in such a manner as to
produce the desired results both in
relation to constructing the highway
and other conditions required by the
Jefferson Highway association.
"A reasonable time will be given
for the favored territory to produce
the required results. Failing to pro
duce these results the award will be
withdrawn from the towns hereinafter
named and another series of towns,
either east or west of the route, here
by selected will be awarded the priv
ilege of constructing the highway and
complying with the conditions re
quired."
In brief the good people along the
route designated are awarded the
privilege by Mr. Clarkson, of Carth
age, Missouri, of constructing the
Jefferson highway at their own ex
pense, of paying $9.00 a mile for that
privilege, and also the privilege of
si
supporting the Jefferson Highway
Declaration by subscriptions and ad
zer mng. It strikes us that the
"privilege" comes high. And then
the "privilege" is simply a license
liable to be revoked at any time.
The Union is glad the eastern route
was not selected by Mr. Clarkson.
Miss Martha Caley at Rest.
When the last summons came to
Miss Martha Caley early last Friday
evening, July 21, it came as a blessed
relief after a long illness.
Miss Martha was the daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. D. A. Caley, who were
honored citizens in the early days of
Princeton.
Princeton has always claimed her as
its own for she was born here on
July 27, 1880, and while the family
left here the year following Dr. Caley's
death in September, 1887, she visited
here often and was at one time for
three years a valued teacher in our
public schools.
She received her education in the
schools of Minneapolis, Faribault and
the University of Minnesota, and all
those who were fortunate enough to
know her well, know that to her an
education included all the finer points
of everything that is beautiful, en
nobling and uplifting.
For eight years Miss Martha was
an instructor in St. Mary's Hall, Fari
bault, and few there are whose in
fluence for good has been more wide
spread than hers. Since her illness,
letters have come from near and far
bearing witness to the value her exam
ple and teachings have been to the
numbers of girls whose lives she had
helped to mould. She was respected
for her dignity and clear vision of
justice as well as loved for her tender
ness and ready sympathy.
When Miss Martha returned to
Princeton last December to be under
the care of her brother, Dr. Guy R.
Caley, her hold on life seemed very
frail and the weeks that grew into
months were weeks of suffering, but
through them all she was a wonderful
example of cheerful, patient courage.
Her mother and her sister, Miss
Katherme, came to be with her and did
all that loving devotion could.
The sympathy of the whole com
munity^ was always with them, for
Miss Martha was beloved by all.
Besides her mother, Dr. Caley and
Miss Katherine, she is survived by two
brothers, Earl D. of Vancouver, B. C,
and Louis Collins of South Bend,
WTash.
The funeral services were held in
the Congregational church Sunday
afternoon at 4 by the Rev. Andrew
D. Stowe of Minneapolis. A quartet
choir consisting of Mrs. H. C. Cooney,
Mrs. E. S. McMillan, Mrs. John Gib
son and Miss Rita Byers, accompanied
by Mrs. Serena M. Anderson, rendered
the church music, including Miss
Martha's favorite hymns, most feel
ingly.
It was gratifying to her friends that
not only did she have for her last
rites the words of her loved church
for she was a devout Episcopalian
but that the services were read by one
whose duty became a labor of love, for
Mr. Stowe was a lifelong friend and
had baptized her when a child. He
asked the friends not to mourn the
loss of one whom he likened to a sweet
flower which had only been trans
planted.
To those who attended, the services,
music and flowers seemed a fitting
farewell to a beautiful life.
Gun Club Record.
At the weekly shoot Thursday eve
ning at the fair grounds the score
was given as follows: Dr. McRae
hit 22 out of a possible 25, Barteldt
also 22, Randall 19, Joe Mossman 13,
Hoffman 12, Jaenicke 12.
Usually Big Joe" is among the top
notchers but for some reason slumped
and came down with the tail enders in
the tournament. The writer of this
squib is a shotgun crank, and can ex
plain Joe's score only by recalling
years ago a trick put upon him by
members of a chicken hunting party
wherein the shells were removed and
some green corn cobs were placed in
the breech of his gun. Said cobs were
not effective in dropping the prairie
hens as they rose up, and an investi
gation developed the faulty ammuni
tion, also a blue flame of "cuss" words
directed principally at Thos. Caley.
In Mossman's case it is probable
cobs were not availablesome of the
shooting gang had withdrawn the shot
from J)e's shells.
Yes, We have Noticed It.
Did you ever notice that when a man
is down and out his enemies stop kick
ing him and his supposed friends start
in to make things unpleasant?

THE SCENIC ROUTE
Temporary Organization Perfected to
Further the Construction of a
Real Scenic Highway.
The Northern Minnesota Scenic High-
way Will Touch Beautiful Lakes
and Noble Rivers.
We wish the people along the route
designated by Mr. J. D. Clarkson of
Carthage, Mo., as the Jefferson High
way, well. May they speedily com
plete a good broad highway clear to
the boundary. But the real Northern
Minnesota Scenic Highway will be
built, too, and probably long before
the Jefferson Highway. The men be
hind the Northern Minnesota Scenic
Highway will get their share of state
and national aid for that project, and
if the local people co-operate the road
will be completed its entire length
within the next two years.
On August 4th a meeting is to be
held at Detroit to perfect the organ
ization initiated at St. Paul on the 24th.
Annexed hereto are Che minutes of
the St. Paul meeting:
At a meeting of representatives of
Northern Minnesota, held at The Saint
Paul hotel on July 24th, 1916, by
representatives of Northern Minne
sota, the following action was taken:
Whereas, it is the sense of this
meeting that the best interests of
Northern Minnesota demand the estab

Be it further resolved, that said
route be a circuitous route, starting
at Elk River, leading north to Prince
ton, Milaca, Onamia, skirting Mille
Lacs on the south and west to Brain
erd, north and west to Walker and
Cass Lake, thence to International
Falls, then west along the Rainy river
to Baudette and Spooner, from there
to Warroad on the Lake of the Woods,
thence southwesterly to Karlstad and
Crookston, thence to Moorhead and
Fargo, along the Red river, then east
to Lake Park. Audubon, Detroit,
Frazee, Perham. then in a southerly
direction to Otter Tail Lake, Henning,
Parkers Prairie, Alexandria, then east
to Osakis, Sauk Centre, Melrose, St.
Cloud and from there to the starting
point at Elk River.
Called Home.
Mrs. Gustava Nyquist of Dalbo
passed quietly away at the home of
her daughter, Mrs. A. L. Dahlin, last
Saturday night, aged 77 years 11
months. She was born in Sweden
came to Minnesota in 1892 and first
resided at Elk River with her son
rank.
Two sons and one daughter survive
her, Frank of Zimmerman, Charles
of Wimbledon, N. D., and Mrs. A. L.
Dahlin of Dalbo, and one sister, Mrs.
J. Sjogerstrand of Rush City, also a
number of grandchildren and great
grandchildren.
Funeral services were held from the
residence on Tuesday afternoon and
interment was in the Wyanett Mission
cemetery. Floral contributions were
profuse and beautiful and tastefully
arranged on the casket.
Mrs. Nyquist was a lovable lady
and her life has been a long and use
ful one and may she enjoy her well
earned rest in heaven.
Death From Acute Alcoholism.
John O. Silene was found dead
about 15 feet west of the right of
way near the Cambridge roller mill
last Thursday afternoon. The coroner
was summoned and he pronounced
death to be due to acute alcoholism.
Deceased was a "floater" or transient,
but he had relatives in the vicinity of
Cambridge.
CAMP UFEJN TEXAS
"Mike" Writes a Newsy and Interest-
ing Letter from Camp Llano
Grande in Texas.
Scorching Hot in the Daytime But
Cool and Comfortable
After Sunset.
Caihp Llano Grande, July 20,1916.
If the home folks could only see us
now they would not even recognize us.
Most every man in the company is
tanned up like a greaser, burned to a
crisp by the hot Texas sun. From 10
a. m. to 4 p. m. the sun beats down in
a perfect torrent of heat and it's pret
ty good policy to get somewhere in
the shade and keep as quiet as possi
ble during this part of the day. The
redeeming feature of this Texas clim
ate is the cool nights. From 4 p. m.
it begins to cool off and by bed time,
which is arbitrarily fixed in this camp
at 9:45 p. m., it is plenty cool enough to
enjoy a good night's sleepin fact the
U. S. army blanket feels pretty good
along about midnight. Another good
feature of this climate is the contin
uous gulf breeze which blows from the
southeast 24 hours out of every 24
and makes life bearable for us
Northerners.
We have been in camp six days now
and the boys from the Rum river val
ley are in good shape physically, at
that. Only a very few have reported
at the hospital at sick call and these
were afflicted with only minor trou
bles. Outside of these small local dis
turbances the boys are all physically
fit and are getting acclimated about as
rapidly as any of the northern troops.
Captain Johnson is very careful with
his men in regard to overwork and a
consequent overheating, and it is prin
cipally due to his good judgment that
the boys are standing up as well as
they are.
The first few days in camp were
very trying on the men owing to the
heat and the poor water supply. The
work of pitching tents, unloading
baggage and making camp was real
hard work for a bunch of men from
the norfti who had spent fixe days on
the train and then jumped right into
hard work before they had a chance
to recuperate from their wearisome
journey. Another drawback was the
poor water supply for the first few
days. When we struck camp the water
supply consisted of irrigation ditch
water, hauled quite a distance by tank
wagons, and not enough to go half
way around among the various regi
ments concentrated here in the usual
American rush way of doing things
first and planning them out carefully
after it is all over. However the wa
ter supply is better now as the grounds
are all piped and the water ready to
turn onbut not turned on as yet.
The lack of water was also a big
handicap in the cooking and washing
game, so all important in this camp
life. Rations were also badly mixed
up the first few days, but this part
of the camp life is better adjusted now
and the men are being fed better than
at the first and conseqeuntly feel bet
ter.
The camp of the Third Minnesota
now presents a very military appear
ance, with the company and regimen
tal streets all ditched and graded up
to the plans and specifications of the
army engineers who staked out the
lines, and then each company got out
their entrenching tools and other im
plements of torture and proceeded to
do some real road work that would
have gladdened the heart of the pub
lisher of the Union. Each tent was al
so ditched in good shape in prepara
tion for the torrential Texas rains
which don't come very often, but when
they do come are near-cloudbursts. A
heavy rain soaked this part of the
country just before we arrived but we
have had no moisture since except the
heavy night dews, which are caused
by proximity to the Gulf cf Mex
ico. The sun shines incessantly dur
ing the day time with a few clouds
obscuring it occasionally, and at
night we always have a bright south
ern moon that makes it almost light
enough to read by.
NOTES.
The hot weather is a big help to
Cook Jones as all he has to do is to
set his eggs, meat or whatever he has
to cook, out in the sun and in a few
minutes it is ready to serve.
A piece of ice has just mysteriously
made its way into the company water
can and as this means an ice cold
drink we will have to duck and beat
it for the water hole while the beating
is good.
The*Princeton ball team is diligently
practicing and when properly acclim
ated will start in cleaning up the
southern leaguethis with all due
respect to the Princeton recruits who
were left at home on this southern trip.
Rattlesnakes, scorpions, tarantulas,
spiders of all kinds, horned toads,
cactus, mesquite and chaparral form
a battalion of new reptiles, insects and
plant life formerly unknown to the
Minnesota men. Every reptile, insect
and form of plant life bears a horn or
sharp spike of some kind, for what
purpose God only knows.
Quartermaster Sergeant Hofflander
is the most contented man in the regi
ment, but there's a reason. Dame
Rumor has it that a dark eyed Mexican
senorita is the cause of HofF's mental
state. (Take this with a grain of salt
cum grano salis, as they would say
in this country.) Nellie G., the dog
mascot of Company G, was lost in
transit and now the company is with
out an official mascot. If anybody has
on old mule or billy goat that he
doesn't want the boys would appreciate
a prompt shipment of same to Camp
Llano Grande, charges prepaid.

The More Roads the Better.
The outcome of the selection of the
northern route of the Jefferson High
way promises to be what was hoped
and predicted in these columnsthe
construction of equally good roads
along the two rejected routes. With
three routes proposed to the commis
sion and only one to be chosen, two
districts must necessarily be disap
pointed. But that is no reason why
these districts should be left without
standard highways. That is the way
the people interested feel about it and
the decision was no more than an
nounced before steps were begun.
Government and state aid in the con
struction of permanent roads of this
character is available at any time. It
is up to the public-spirited people of
the territory affected to say whether
they shall enjoy the benefits of good
roads or sit in idleness and surrender
all benefits to the counties and towns
through which the designated highway
shall pass. Northern Minnesota has
taken the lead in the road crusade, and
in many respects is better equipped
than the southern part of the state.
It will be very characteristic of North
ern Minnesota to get busy now and
provide two arterial highway systems
that will put the Jefferson route to
its mettle, both in quality of roadway
and time of completion. The more
road competition we can get the
better.St. Paul Dispatch.
Working in the Sun.
Most of us are such creatures of
habit that we are likely, in digging,
cultivating, transplanting and thin
ning, to begin always at the same end
of the garden rows and to work al
ways in the same direction. Try vary
ing of the method to suit the season
and tne time of day. If the day is
hot and you want to avoid the effect
of the sun as much as possible turn
your face to it. If the day is cool and
sun's warmth adds to your comfort,
turn your back to it. In garden work
you are bound to stoop more or less
and with your back to the sun you
present the broadest expanse of your
person^ to its rays. On the contrary
when you face the sun, so stooping,
the rays strike mostly on your head,
which, of course, should be protected
by an ample hat with, perhaps a cab
bage leaf in it.Country Gentleman.
A Plucky Girl.
For the first time in three years
Miss Mabel Prescott of Spencer Brook
is home from Montanaand she is
just convalescing from an operation
at the Northwestern hospital. Miss
Prescott went out to Montana three
years ago last June and took up a
320 acre homestead on the Crow reser
vation in Rosebud county, about 15
miles from a railroad. She complied
with all the requirements of the law,
proved up and now has a patent to
her land, which is worth from $20.00
to $30.00 an acre. Most of the time
she lived alone in her shack on her
claim. Miss Prescott is certainly a
plucky little schoolma'am.

ALVAH'S GRADUATES
A Group of Remarkably Bright Young
Graduates From the St. Cloud
Journal-Press Office.
Also Quite a Few From the Anoka
Herald Office Under the Tu-
telage of Prof. Eastman.
Frank M. Eddy of the Sauk Center
Herald is responsible for the follow
ing:
"It has been reported that the edi
tor of the Journal-Press intends to
start a training school for candidates.
Well, why not? Who has shown bet
ter qualifications? Irving Caswell,
Andy Fritz, Harvey Grimmer and last
but not least, Harold Knutson, are all
proteges of Eastman. During the last
twenty years, you could not throw a
club into Minnesota officialdom, either
republican or democratic, without
hitting one of "Alvah's boys.'* While
never a candidate for an elective
office himself he has made more can
didates and piloted more men to elec
tion than any other man in the state.
"Our advice to aspiring candidates
is first to secure Alvah's support and
then go ahead.
"We hope he starts the school afore
said. We here and now apply for
two scholarships."
This is of course one of Eddy's
pleasant jokes, but it recalls that the
editor has had the support of some
wonderfully bright boys, and who
have made good in various lines. In
addition to the above, there is Major
A. A. Caswell of Anoka, who started
for the Mexican border the other day
with three sons Dr. Eugene Murphy
of St. Paul M. C. Cutter, editor of the
Thief River News, and who for sev

dent in the Divinity school at Yale,
and Editor Honor of the Cold Spring
Record.
It is really a remarkable list of able
men, who are taking an active and in
fluential part in the world's work.
And we once again pay a tribute to
the memory of those who made a
mark high up in achievement and hon
orable endeavor, and who are ever an
inspiration to us: C. C. Eastman,
who was the editor of the Wadena

At.present he will be located at the
Merchants hotel, but as soon as the
new addition of the First National
bank is completed, Dr. Stacey will
occupy the rooms in the addition and
will have a thoroughly modern and
up-to-date place.
All instruments will be sterilized by
electricity and, the addition being
built especially for the purpose of a
dental office, will insure every con

The rooms will be lighted by a semi
indirect system and will be furnished
in mahogany and fumed oak."
