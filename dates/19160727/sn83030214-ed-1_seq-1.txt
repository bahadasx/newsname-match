TRIES TO DIE
Detective, Shunned by
Fellow Catholics,
Shoots Himself.
DUE TO TAKE
STAND TO-DAY
Sought to Do Duty to Po?
lice and Church?May
Not Survive.
Detective John J. Kennel. a good
Catholic and a good policeman, shot
himself yesterday in the stuffy little
room in the Hudson Terminal Building
which Ifl the headquarters of the police
wire-tapping squad, of which he was
temporarily in charge. The bullet
struck him just below the heart, and
he is dying in Yolunteer Hospital.
For weeks he had struggled under
the conviction of others that his duty
to his Church and his duty as a police?
man were in conflict. It was clear
enough to him. He would do his duty
and be a good Catholic, too. He felt that
Ma friends avoided him, that they
looked upon him as a renegade to his
(hurch. because his superior officer
had ordered him to eavesdrop at the
telephone wire of a priest of his
(hurch and he had obeyed the order.
His burden made his waking hours a
dream and banished sleep at night. If
he slept he would awake crying:
"Leave me alone!"
Hifl Deapalr Deepened.
Since the test made at the hearing
before Justice Greenbanm a week ago,
ir. which Kennel listened in on a pre
arranged conversation carried on by
attorneys representing Father William
B. Farrell, his despair deepened. He
had not succeeded in transcribing that
conversation. He was to have taken
the stand again to-day.
"I am a Catholic, a good Catholic,"
he said in the hospital. "I simply did
my duty, something 1 had to do and
was ordered to do, and I did it honest
ly, and that is what hurts. My chil?
dren, my family and myself were
snubbed hy peopie whom I don't care

"Suddenly everything became blue

anything until thev were standing

petectivrs Di C'ilio and Watson
were with Kennel at the switchboard.
As he straightened up after putting
en his shoes thev heard him mutter:
"Oh, the failure of this thing to go
through. If it doesn't it will drive me
mad. Just look what it means to me "
With the laal words Kennel's ser?

-.moke and clamor. His companions
saw that the wour.d wa* serious. Thev

VOTES TO DROP
BOYS IN ARMY
Senate Wants None Under
21 to Serve Without
Parents' Consent.
IFrnra Th* TrlMin* n'rr'au 1
Washington, July 2**. Fvery boy less
than twen'y-one years old who has en?
listed in the regulars or been drafted
into the Federai service through the
militia without the consent of his
parents or guardians, if he has any,
must be released under the terms of
an amendment to the army appropria?
tion hil! adopted by the Senate to-day.
If th* House accepts the amendment
the effect will be to release thousands
of boys between eighteen and twenty
one who are now on the border. A
large percentage of recent enlistments
in the regular army have heen of boys
under twenty-one, it is deelared.
Senator La Follette, who fought the
amendment through, arraigned the
conferrees on the recent Hay army
reorganization bill because they made
it possible for the enlistment, with?
out the consent of their parents, of
boys over eighteen. Prior to en
actment of the Hay law the law pro
vided that a man must be twenty-one
to enlist in the regular army without
pirental consent. Neither house, Mr.
La Follette charged to-day, diseussed
the question of re.lucing this age, and
yet the conferroes slipped into the
bill and both houses passed the
meaMir* without noting the change
a provision that boys of eighteen or
.\.r could be enlisted without their
pai.'r.'-' BI sruardians' consent.
Led by Senator Hlair Le*, of Mary

Failing to beat th-*. whole amendment,

Senator La Follette refused to ac?

him. Senator Cn.Wwood said that if it

keep boys out of the army at that ag*,
unless tney had their parents' or guard?
ians' consent, it would be a good thing
now.
At the suggestion of Senator Brande
gee, Mr. La Follette changed his amend?
ment so that boys who within ninety
days obtained consent of their parents
to remain in the service might do so.
As the amendment BBflOaatad to a

On Board The Tribune Launch,
1'atapsco River, Baltimore, July 26.
The submarine merchantman Deutsch?
land will not sail for another week,
in spite of the fact that clearance
papers for her were taken out by
Captain Paul Koenig this afternoon.
This statement was made to-night
by Carl A. I.uederitz, the German
consul. He would give no explanation
for the delay.
Mr. Luederitz also announced the
postponement ot a garden party that
was to have been held at his suburban
home to-night. This was owing to thr.
inability of Ambassador von Bernstorff
to be present, he said.
Every preparation for the Deutsch
land's sailing had been made and the
vessel was ready to the last detail, the
agents announced this morning. When
the papers were taken out it was gen?
erally supposed that the dash to sea
would be made some time to-night or
early to-morrow- at least that the sub
martna would go down to the entranca
to the Chesapeake to wait for a favor
able opportunity for the dash.
Think Bremen Has Reported.
Since the sailing of the Deutschland
and the arrival of her sister ship, the
Bremen, have been linked together in
all the gossip here, there are many who
believe that some word from the latter
vessel, now believed to be at least ten
days overdue, has been received.
To-night there is no more secrecy
concerning the elaborate plans of the
Deutaehland'. enemies to sink her
either in neutral waters or on the high
seas, no matter what the cost. The
lines have been tightly drawn about
her and boats of tonnage ranging from
the smallest launch to the biggest
freighter have been distributed along
the channels of the Chesapeake Bay,
down which the boat must move.
Think Signal Called Cruiser.
"It's a case of the fighters sinking
her and letting the diplomats settle
the affair at their leisure," waa the
way one old sailor put it. "The Brit?
ish followed that policy in Chili and
there is no doubt but that they will
do the same thing here."
Just how seriously the Allied cruis?
ers off the Virginia capes are pursuing
their quest for the submarine was
shown by the dash of the Bntish
cruiser into neutral waters about the
capes yesterday. Those in touch with
the situation here are convinced that
the big fighter ventured close to shore
in response to a signal from the docks
here which was misunderstood. Tele
graph and telephone code messages are
being sent t. the capes almost hourly
that the cruisers patrolling the coast
may know every movement aboard the
Deutschland.
That the Uuited States customs offi?
ciais ?re stretching every point to
favor the bek-aguered boat was proved
by the manner of granting clearance
papers this afternoon. Although Cap?
tain Koenig made an affidavit in which
he announced the contents of his cargo,
the Deutschland will depart without
permitting this secret from becoming
public.
Tramp Halta Near l'-Boat.
George Thalheimer, marine clerk, who
issued the permit to clear, said the
eon'ents of the affidavit would not be
disclosed until after the submarine had
departed.
Late this evening the British tramp
steamer Highbury moved into the har?
bor and east anchor within 200 feet of
the boat Itfl captain would have given
so much to sink, even here in neutral
waters. Thst official took no pains to
conceal his intentions concerning the
Deutschland.
"You know I'm watching that thing,"
he said. "All I hope is that we'll meet
again under different eircumstances."
There was an atmosphere of secrecy
before the arrival of Captain Koenig,
Philip Vol-. and Captain Frederick
Hinsch at the collector's office. Cus?
toms, officiais professed to know noth?
ing of any arrangement for the filing
of the manifest after the usual hours.
The truth wns that the Eastern For
wnrding Company had requested per
niaaien for tearing a bit of red tape.
At last, when officiais and newspaper
men wen> tired waiting, the Deutsch?
land skipper arrived. Immediately
Chief Clerk Thalheimer took Captain
Koenig behind a railing and began the
us'ial formalities.
"How many are there in the crew?"
he asked, among other questions.
?Besides myself, twenty-eight," re?
turned the captain.
This was newt. It had been an

east of Gorodische the Czar's troops
took up the attack. They, too, pene
trated into the enemy's lines, but were
hurled back in fierce counter charges.
The dead nnd wounded of both armies
lay in such numbers on the furrowed
hr-.ttle ground that by dawn it became
virtually impossible for either side to
conduct operations. Then only came
a lull in the fighting.
Near Kemmern, twenty miles west of
Riga, von Hindenburg made his Int
serious effort in several days to check
the advance of Kuropatkin's force-..
In a desperate all-day battle the Ger?
mans nearly succeeded in penetrating
the Russian front line, but the steady
deluge of fire from the Russian guns
could not be withstood and the attaek
ers fell back to their lines, their num?
bers greatly depleted.
Brody Attacked on Two Sidea.
Ten miles north of Brody the Rus?
sian hosts are hammer.ng at the lines
of General Boehm-Ermolli, trying to
! smash a hole through which to drive
on the town, while to the west th*y
are slowly pushing a wedge whose tip
will soon strike the town at another
i point.
Von Linsingen's line? on the Stok?
hod continue to hold firm, but it rs the
opinion of military ooservers here that
the Russian drive on Viadimir-Volyn
ski and the upper Bug from the south
will eventually compel the abandon
ment of these pogitions.
Teutons Strengthen Defenrea.
Kvery day, however, is grving the
Germans more opportunity to strength?
en the defences in this region, and it
is conceded that the Russians must
strike quickly or lose whatever advan

enemy back from the Lipa and Styr
lines. With plenty of time in which

By ARTHIR S. DRAPER.
London, July 26.?The capture of
the last of Pozieres, reported by
General Haig early to-day, though it
involves the clearing of only a few
acres of ground, has rejoiced all
Britain and greatly encouraged the
belief that the Allied offensive wil!
win through.
Far more than the ground actu?
ally won the success means to Brit?
ain: The first breaking of the Ger
1 man third line since the fiasco of
La Bassee nearly eighteen months
ago; success of new troops against
German veterans at a time when it
was evident they had put forth all
their strength. and a* a place they
had resolved tn hold at any cost;
and, finally, the capture of heighta
which are the key both to the power
fully fortified Albert ridge, includ?
ing the bloody ground of Longueval,
Guillemont, (ombles and the Fou?
reaux Wood, and to the plains slop
l ing toward Bapaume l.cyond.
Expect New Spurt.
The army experts expect to-night
that the British offensive will take
a new spurt as soon as the captured
ground can be consolidated. The
! statement that two trenches to the
west have been cleared is believed
to show that Haig is already push
ing on along the Bapaume road, and
that he will .oori be on the flank,
and perhaps in the rear, of the ridge
forts he has been unable to seize
by direct assaults.
On his right, too, he is now in a
much better po_ition. sinco from the
new positions gun** eat. ennlade the

and of the almost impregnable Leip.
sie. redoubt. All these positions are
expected to be in British hands soon.
Five Milea from Victory.
The British are now about five miles
from a decisive victory in the capture
of Bapaume and the turning of tha
(ierman po.-itions along at least a
thirty-mile front. They were just aa
noar at Gallipoli, but here their out
look is much brighter. At C.allipoli
the British had few men, and it wa.
difficult to bring up supplies. while
their enemies had almost unhmited re?
sources. Now the British resources are
unhmited, while the Germans are
frrced to shuttle men back and forth
to meet the changing pressure. It
must also be taken into consideration
that the majority of the British troops
are now gaining their tirst fighting ex
prnence. They will naturally 'mprove,
espeoally the artillery.
Strongeat i'oint on Line.
The tinal clearing out of Poiierea,
v.hich the Britiah considered the
strongest point along the eight-mila
sector where they have been driving
for the laat eleven days, came after
midnight on Tuesday, af*er three days
and nights of some of the most des
perate lighting of the war. The firat
rush of the Anzac men chosen for tha
tremendous task carried thern half way
through the village Saturday night.
But from that time on they have been
winning literally only foot by foot.
Each eellar, the luins of each house,
have been turned into a separate and
?owerful fortresn, and from these the
Germans literally had to be blasted
out. Hand grenadea, knives, occa
sionally the bayonet, were about tha
only arms that could be used. But
tinally. last night, the remnantg of tha
Australian force came to the outskirta
-if the town and were able to look down
iiTuT the valley below. where tha Ger?
man communication trenches are, and
to see in the distance the lights of
Bapaume.
Counter-Attack Awaited.
A German counter-attark is expected
at any moment. The Germans hava
ahown how valuable they regard the
ruins. Three times during the last
three days heavy force.. have been
thrown a?*in*.t Um Anzac men, and they
have had to defend tht-m.'elvea dea
perately before KOing back to their
slow, murderous, ciaan up work. Tha
reports from Berlin of the prepara?
tions for a German offensive are taken
aenously here, and supported by tha
reporta of British officers. If Germany
cannot hold there if she cannot re
gain the lost ground-then lt will ba
