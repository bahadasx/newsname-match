WAGES
Shall they be determined by
Industrial War fare or
Federal Inquiry?
To the American Public:
x Do you believe in arbitration or indus
trial warfare? -.
The train employes on all the railroads
arc voting whether they will give their leaders '
authority to tie up the commerce of the
country to enforce their demands for a 100
million dollar wage increase.
The railroads are in the public service
your service. This army of employes is in
the public service your service.
You pay for rail transportation 3 billion
dollars a year, and 44 cents out of every
; dollar from you goes to the employes. - -.
On all the Western railroad in 1915, seventy-five per cent of the
train employes earned these wages (lowest, highest and average
of all) as shown by the pay rolls

The average yearly wage payments to all Western train cm

A 100 million dollar wage increase for
men in freight and yard service (less than
one-fifth of all employes) is equal to a 5 per
cent advance in all freight rates.
The managers of the railroads, as trustees
for the public, have no right to place this
burden on the cost of transportation to you
without a clear mandate from a public tri
bunal speaking for you.
The railroads have proposed the settle
ment of this controversy either under the
existing national arbitration law, or by refer
ence to the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. This offer has been refused by the
employes' representatives.
Shall a nation-wide strike or an o
investigation under the Gov
ernment determine this issue?

Primary August 1st
Next Tuesday, August 1st, is
the date for ths Primary elec
tion. '. ' .
This year the-e are four tick
ets in the field, Democratic, Re
publican, Socialist, and Prohi
bition. The names of the can
didates of each party appear on
separate ballots, aud all that is
necessary for the voter is to call
for tbe ballot of the party which
he desires to vote, make a cross
(X) in tbe square to the right of
the 'name of the candidate ' for
whom he desires to vote, fold bis
ballot and return it to a member
of tbe election board.
Many voters have the idea tbat
it is not important that they vote
at the orimary. This is a mis
take. It is just as much your
duty to express you opinion as
to who you want for a candidate,
at the August primary, as it is
for you to express your pref
erence for the office holders at
the November election.
It is to be hoped that every
voter in Meade county, women
as well as nun, will pay a visit to
the voting place in their respsct
ive township on August 1st and
indicate their choice for candi
dates for the various offices.
Meade County Fair
The Meade County Fair books
advertising the big Meade Coun
ty Fair are now out. Tbe book
is the largest ever distributed

some very liberal premiums,
The list of special prtmiums is
especially worth your attention.
The dates are September 5, 6,

for each day are the best. Plan
to attend.
Postponed
The meeting of the union
chorus, which' was to have been
held in the Baptist church, Fri
day evening, July 28th, baa been
postponed one week because of
the After-Harvest Social to be

Davis For Attorney
In tbe matter of the selection
for your candidate for County
Attorney, consider your own in
terests a vote for the same on
August 1st.
Mr. Davis -bas lived in Meade
county thirty five years, and
eacb year bas paid taxes, while
bis opponent has not succeeded
as yet, in paying taxes lor one
year. Which of these two would
be most likely tolook after tbe
tax payers' interests?
Two years ago Mr. Davis
made the race for County At
torney, on the Republican ticket.
Tbe party being split and three
candidates in the field, he lost
by thirty-one vote.
After being to tbe expense and
handicapped with a split party,
which polled at tbat election
more than 250 votes, he feela
now tbat be is entitled to the
nomination from a party stand
point when tbere is a chance to
win.
If yoa believe so, be solicits
jour support. .sir.
The Widow's Pension Bill
The following remarks, on tbe
above bill were trade by Con
gressman JouettShouse, of Kan
sas, in tbe House of Represen
tatives, June 19, 1916.
Mr.SIIOUSE. Mr. Speaker,
since tbe beginning of the Sixty
fourth Congress I have served
as a member of the Committee
on Invalid Pensions. In many
respects tbat service has been
both the most pleasant and the
most unsatisfactory work' I have
done as a member of Congress
pleasant because of,tbe result of
effort expanded in a good cause,
unsatisfactory because many
deserving cases could uot be
reached. Before that committee
thousands of bills bare been pre
sented, tbe object of them all to
help care more liberally for the
men who defended tbe integrity
of tbe Union during tbe Civil
War, or to give to tbe widows of
those men some part of tbe ma
terial recognition which their
husbands soricbly earned. Witb
few exceptions the thousands of
cases brought to tbe attention of
our committee were worthy.
The evidence in connection witb
a large majority of them disclos
ed conditions pitiful in the ex
treme poverty, sickness, lone
hness all of the heart rending
circumstances that surround des
titute old age.
Tbe Committee' on Invalid
Pensions bas done its work well.
Tbe clerks and tbe examiuers of
that committee have been dili
gent and faithful. A large num
ber of tbe special pension bills
have been enacted into law, but
no matter how zealous or perse
vering a committee, it could not
consider 7,000 individual bills in
one session of Congress. Tbe
men who wore the blue are all
old men now. Few of tbem are
capable of further labor; many
are without income aside from
their pensions, and those pen
sions for the most part are in
adequate to a com. "or table living.
Therefore tbe labors of the com
mittee have been directed prin
cipally to selecting tbe most
needy of tbe cases of tbe old sol
diers themselves and giving tbo-e
cases attention; but among tbe
widows of old soldiers were found
innumerable instances equally
appealing, and in order to meet
the situation it was strikingly
apparent that some general leg
islation for these widows was
necessary. Nothing has been
done for them for yeats Where
allowauce is now made by law it
is pitifully meager, and no widow
who married her soldier husband
subsequent to 1890 more tban
25 years ago bas claim for pen
sion at all.
To remedy this unjust' state
of affairs, several bills were in
troduced in Congress and were
referred to our committee. Af
ter careful consideration tbe
Asb brook bill was selected as
meeting the views of a majority,
and with certain amendments it
was reported to the House for
passage. Tbat bill is before
you to-day. Let us see just
what iu proposes.
At tbe present time tbe wid
ow's pension is $12 per month.
This bill increases tbe allowance
to $20 a month where tbe widow
married tbe soldier preceeding
or during tbe Civil War, or
where the widow is now 70 years
of age or when sh.e may reach 70
years of age. Can such increase
be considered either extravagant

Hay Fever
"Persons susceptible to bay
fever should avoid renting or
buying property in a neighbor
hood "with neglected grass and
weeds. This practice would
probably be of effective assist
ance in correcting sucb neglect.
' Tbe prevention of hay fever is
fundamentally a simple proposi
tion. It means to: enactment and
enforcement of an ordinanct to
cut grass and weeds. The ef
ficiency of tbis bas been shown
in New Orleans, ' La., Asbeville,
N. C. and a number of other
cities where bay feyer is on tbe
disappearing list. Another year
should see similar effects in the
majority of towns and cities."
From the report of tbe American
Hay Fever Prevention Associa
tion. August and September
months of horror for the bay
fever victims in Topeka and all
over the United States, for tbat
matter.
Here is wbat the American
Hay Fever Association says;
"All cases of bay fever are due
to tbe inhalation of pollen, tbe
majority of these being due to
useless weeds. Tbe cases tbat
develop before August are caus
ed chiefly by the pollen of ne
glected grasses and of summer
blooming weeds.
The principal causes of bay fev
er cases developing in the tall are
the various forms of rag weeds,
whose capacity for distributing
pollen is measured by tbe bun
dred millions. The most com
mon forms of tbis weed are tbe
common rag weed (ambrosia ar
temisiaefolla) fcund in tbe great
er part of tbe United States, east
of Kansas; tbe giant rag weed,
(ambrosia trigda) growing in
moist areas of this section, and
tbe Wesiern ragweed (ambrosia
psilostachya) principally found
west of Kansas. Topeka State

Topeka Notes v '
James A. Arment, of Dodge
City, was a Topeka visitor tbe
first of tbis week; came to con
sult witb tbe Department Com
mander who is also President of
tbe Southwestern Veterans As
sociation which meets annually
in Wright Park, Dodge City.
Tbe Association and 'the City
Commissioners have a lawsuit
pending over tbe money of the
Association. Tbe City was at
tempting to appropriate some
$700 dollars to tbe nse of tbe city
to be used in the purchase of a
hose cart for the fire depart
ment. When tbe cane was beard

Why Not a Street Sprinkler
During tbe past week, evident
ly due to tbe unusual amount of
dust on account of thedry weath
er, we have beard considerable
comment as to why tbe street
sprinkler was not beiag operated.
There is a sprinkler in Meade,
owned by private individuals.
It seems tbat some arrangement
could be made whereby it could
be operated by Jbe f Citjr if. no j
one can bi) Un'tiaVwlit) & .willing 1
to operate it on tbe plan followed
in previous years. The un
pleasantness of the dust blow
ing into the business bouses is'
a sufficient cause for some action . -in
this matter, to say nothing of
the damage done to goods.
There surely ought to be some
solution, and, perhaps if tbe City
officials and tbe business men
tould take the matter up jointly,
more could be accomplished. -
tbe City Clerk, who acted as
Secretary of tbe Association in
the year of 1914, was ordered to
pay over to the President, Sec
retary, and Treasurer of the
Association a certain sum of the
money in controversy. To this
order the city moved for a new
hearing and the motion was set
for hearing August 1st. The
good people of Dodge City, who
have always been the friend of
the Association went to the City
Commissioners and tried to pur
suad tbem to no longer stand in
their own light, beseeching tbem
to iron out tbe misunderstand-,
iugs to the end that tbe annual
reunion might be staged as us
ual. It now seems as though
tbe matter of difference will be
adjusted and tbat an old time
reunion will be held at Dodge
City commencing September 11,
1916, where tbere will be gather
ed together tbe largest number
of old soldiers and their friends
that will meet anywhere in Kan
sas in tbe year 1916, "and. soon
all the sore spots between tbe of
ficers of tbe Association and tbe
City Officals will have healed,
ane together in a unity of action
will again result in giving to
Western Kansas, the laurels for
holding the greatest reunion in
tbe state.
Weather in Topeka warm and
dry. Rain is badly needed.
People flock every evening by
hundreds to tbe various parks,
On Sunday evening they go out
as late as 11 o'clock at mgbt.
Many families go early in tbe
morning and stay all day, taking
witb tbem well filled lunch bask
ets; and all day tbe swings and
bathing pools are well patronized
Commander Painter left Tues
day for Eureka to attend their
soldiers' reunion, and from tbere
be goes to Cherry vale to a sold
iers' reunion.
Candidates of all parties are in
the field to mingle with the dear
voters, pressing tbeir claims for
votes, at tbe primaries. We
hope tbe voters will promptly,
respond so onr commonwealth
will be properly protected.
