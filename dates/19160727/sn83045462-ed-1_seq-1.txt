blacklist is made
an rams.
Note of Protest to British Government
Is Cabled to
London.
OFFICIALS HERE BELIEVE
NEUTRAL RIGHTS INVADED
London Contention is mat ingiana
Has Only Approached Continental
Position.
A note to Great Britain objecting
to the blacklisting of American
business firms as an "invasion
of neutral rights" was
cabled to London last night by
the State Department.
Acting Secretary Polk, announcing
today that the communication had been
dispatched, declined to discuss it further
than to say that It contained "representations."
He said it would be
given out for publication Monday.
Satisfied List Is Illegal.
State Department officials believe
that their study of the blacklist clearly
has proved that it Injures American
firms in violation of international law.
Acting Secretary Polk talked over with
President Wilson yesterday facts laid
before him by the firms affected, and
the precedents on which the United
States will act.
When the principles involved are
taken up with the British government
it is expected that issue also will be
taken with France, Russia and Italy.
It is understood here that in announcing
its blacklist Great Britain really
acted in deference to her allies, who
felt that their own merchants were suffering
and some British merchants
were profiting through failure of the
London government to follow the lead
of the continental powers in making
indiscriminate war upon all of their enemies,
commercial as well as military,
and upon those located in neutral countries
as well as those resident in Germany
and Austria-Hungary.
British Government's Attitude.
The allies' view of the legal aspects
of the black list order, which probably
will be the ha.sis of the narliampntarv
statement to be issued soon in London
and be incorporated in the reply to the
American protest, is understood to be
as follows:
The allies agreed to enforce international
law against their enemies and
upon all their subjects without distinction
The continental rule, applied by
Germany, France. Italy and Russia,
interprets the word "enemy" as a person
of enemy origin or interest. English
and American precedents put the emphasis
on domicile. Consequently British
subjects have considered they could
trade with any enemy firm domiciled in
a neutrsfl country.
If the continental view of the law
were applied by Great Britain, suspicion
would attach, the British government
contends, to every firm of German
name in a neutral country. The trade
of the British empire with the United
States for the eleven months ended
with May 30 amounted to two and a
half billion dollars, or almost half of
the total foreign commerce of America.
Of all the fjrms engaged in this trade
only thirty-one have been declared to
be enemy firms.
A withdrawal of the list, it is
further contended, would have the effect
of casting suspicion upon transactions
with all firms with ??? ? ? ?
names which are acting entirely In I
neutral interest and whose profits are j
accruing to neutrals. The effect of
the prohibition to trade with these
firms would be to transfer British
business from firms acting in the interest
of Germany to firms acting in
the interest of the United States.
Claim Benefits to Americans.
It Is expected by Great Britain that
ir. operation the measure will benefit
those firms which are purely American
i^ character as distinguished
from those firms which, though operating
here, really are trading in foreign
interest. In cases where injury
to purely American interests has resulted
Great Britain will be glad to
entertain and carefully consider representations.
The rule to prohibit trading with the ;
enemy, either directly or indirectly, i
and the right of a sovereign govern- j
ment to prohibit its subjects from
trading with any one?friend or foe? I
was maintained by the United States,
Great Britain is ready to point out,
in 1807. 1809 and during the civil war.
Furthermore, if the United States government
is disposed to challenge the
right to issue black lists It cannot rely,
it is argued, upon the support even of
Germany in its contentions, as the
government of that country already
has committed itself to the extreme
Icvnunemai view lowaM which the
British government Is making only a
mall approach.

CANDIDATE HUGHES
MEETSPOUTICIANS
Full of Energy, Enthusiasm
and Optimism, He Confers on
Coming Campaign.
MARYLANDERS CARRY
ENCOURAGING REPORTS
Admit State Is Close. But Believe
Republicans Have Shade Better
nf flip PrnsiipptR
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK. July 27.?Full of energy,
enthusiasm and optimism, Candidate
Hughes came to town today from
his summer home to meet and confer
with a number of visiting politicians
from far and near and to inspire them
with some of his own aggressiveness
for the campaign, as well as to receive
reports of conditions. Mr. Hughes'
motto is that the campaign can be won
for the republicans, but that it will
have to be won by fighting and that
they cannot wish victory upon themselves.
He is to lead his forces himself,
and it is to be share and share alike In
the burden of battle.
Among his callers were Galen L. Tait,
chairman of the Maryland republican
state committee, and O. E. Weller, republican
candidate for governor in
1915. Mr. Weller is now at the head of
| the Hughes Alliance of Maryland, the
organization which is to appeal to the
I independent vote of the state in behalf
of the republican ticket.
Fight Close in Maryland.
"Maryland is close, but the republicans
have a shade the better of the
prospects," said Mr. Tait. "The democrats
have not carried Maryland by a
clear majority in a national election
since 1892. McKinley carried the state
bv 33,000 in 1896 and by 18,000 in 1900.
and in 1912 the combined regular and
progressive vote was eighty-nine in
excess of the democratic vote. "But to
show how the state has been coming back
to the republicans, in 1912 Taft had
53,000 republicans to Roosevelt's 57,000;
in 1913 the 53,000 had increased to
73,000, by 1914 had grown to 95,000 and
by 1915 to 117,000, on the gubernatorial
votes 3,000 less than the democratic.
The progressives not only are coming
back, but they are back. I am conflHant
t Vl 1 t OS nar nant nf <Vin nm m-Ar e
ives who were formerly republicans
will support the ticket this year '*
Mr. VV'eller coincided with Mr. Tait's
statement and added: "Maryland has a
pronouncedly large independent-conservative
vote. Baltimore has the
largest independent vote of any city,
comparatively. That vote is against
radicalism of all kinds, is for sound
money, reasonable protective tariff and
constructive government.
Expects Independent Vote.
"The independnt vote will be .attracted
to the republican candidate and platform
in the national election. I believe
that our candidate for United
States senator will win over Lewis
with the aid of the independent-conservative
vote, which is opposed to
Lewis radicalism.
"I believe we will surely carry the
Cumberland congressional district,
which was republican for many years
consecutively, but has been represented
in the last three terms by a democrat.
We will also re-elect Mr. Mudd in the
flftk ^iotrint wrUI rtt it a ffcrVit
a real fight, In every congressional district
in the state."
Judgment Sought by Leaders.
Representative McKinley of Illinois
and John C. Eversman, secretary of the
republican national congressional committee,
were among those who came
over to the republican conferences today.
Mr. McKinley is a prominent figure
in the inner councils of the republican
management, and his judgment
is sought by the leaders. Campaign
policies and conditions were under discussion
today, and there were side
meetings going on at several places.
Former .Senator W. Murray Crane came
down from his home in Massachusetts to \
meet some of the visiting republicans.
I Joseph B. Keallng of Indiana also was
in the meeting and brought details of
progress being made in the campaign
in the Hoosler state.
Mexico was freely discussed. Senator
Fall of New Mexico bringing Mr.
Hughes information gathered upon a !
recent visit to the border. The reten- j
tion of the militia on the border was j
taken up. The New York state leaders !
are worried over the problem of keeping j
away from the polls of 17,000 New York
i militiamen, many of whom are republican
voters.
PACKERS COMPROMISE CASE.
/
Reach Agreement With Crown Attorneys
as to Maracas Cargo.
LONDON, July 27.?After the case
j had been partially heard an agree!
ment was reached between representa'
tlves of the Chicago packers and the
I crown attorneys ir regard to the cargo
[ on board the American steamship
! Maracas, which was consigned to
Gothenburg and Copenhagen, and
which the crown had asked the court
to condemn,
i The Maracas was seized by the BritJ
ish government in March, 1915.
The crown attorney announced that ]
as a comprehensive arrangement had
j been made with the packers with regard*
to other cargoes the crown did
not wish to pursue the case further.
As regards the proceeds from the
sale of the steamer, it had been arranged
and agreed that a sum would
i emain in court an part of the prize
fund, and that the balance of the
proceeds from the vessel should be
paid to the people entitled to the vessel.
It was announced that the agreement
was subject to the approval of
the American court.

NAVAL VESSELS KEEPING

Visit of British Cruiser to American
Waters Still Is Under
Investigation.
NORFOLK, Va? July 27.?
With strict enforcement of neutrality
laws assured by the presence
of the armored cruiser North
Carolina and three torpedo boat
destroyers just outside Cape
Henry, near the inner allied warship
patrol line, persons interested
in the Deutschland's successful
departure here today took
a more optimistic view of her
chances for dashing out into the
Atlantic in safety.
A statement frequently attributed to
Capt. Koenig of the Deutschland, that
if his ship could make the three-mile
limit without interference she would be
safe, was recalled coincident with the
declaration that she now is certain of
undisturbed passage ofr that distance.
Many Rumors on Shore.
The neutrality guard appeared, to be
resting easily outside the capes today.
The North Carolina moved about
but little, while the torpedo boat destroyers
worked slowly up and down
the allied patrol line, hugging closely
to an English cruiser. The presence of
the four United States ships was productive
of many rumors on shore. Citizens
frequently called newspaper offices ?
during last night and today reporting
that an aeroplane had Just been sight- f)
ed, or that a submarine had appeared. \
Thus far no aeroplane practice has been |J
taken, but it will be later, as the
North Carolina's orders include directions
to have her aviators fly.
Visit of British Cruiser.
Supplemental reports on the appear
ance of an English cruiser within the capes
early Tuesday morning were
being prepared by naval officers here
today for transmission to the Navy Department.
Various details of the incident have
gone forward to Washington at different
times since Tuesday morning, but
the department has expressed a desire ^
for more. One point, it is understood, P
that it desires cleared up is why the ri
cruiser was not seen leaving the capes. H
Thus far the only report of her being
seen after she passed the Louisiana on h
her upward journey has come from un- a>
official sources, who said they saw her g
on her outward journey near Cape
Henry shortly before daylight. *

No Report to Admiralty. ?
LONDON, July 27. 3:22 p.m.?At the 11
admiralty today it was stated that no
information had been received there regarding
the reported mysterious visit
Tuesday morning of a British cruiser ni
within the American territorial waters ^
of the Virginia capes. u

H
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British am- H
a ..tin., m
iinnoauui , iiu</i nitu v i i i. m uc^iciai j r uift ^
today thag h?s had received a message w
from the admiral commanding the British
squadron on the Atlantic coast denying
that a British warship had entered Ches- Q
apeake bay, as reported by the commander
of the battleship Louisiana.
The ambassador said the British ships
had strict orders not to enter the threemile
limit of American territorial waters BV
to waylay the German submarine w
Deutschland, or for any other purpose, tf
and the admiral had reported that these
instructions had not been violated at any
time.
Mr. Polk was told that the British hi
admiral was very indignant over the
report that one of his cruisers had
made an injcurslon into Chesapeake ^
bay under cover of darkness early yesI
terday morning.
The statement of the ambassador ?t
I will be accepted by the 8tate Depart- "
! ment, but the commander of the Louie|
lana is being pressed by the navy for B?
j further details on his report that a
craft which passed him at Lynnhaven v<
| Inlet signaled "English cruiser." Of- B'
j ficlals do not know what to make of
i the case, but are inclined to believe P1
that the American officer was the victim
of some kind of hoax.
Officials Here Are Silent T
as to Instructions Given
Cruiser Worth Carolina ?
The armored cruiser North Carolina ^
an(] three United States destroyers were 8*
! on neutrality# duty today outside the ^
Virginia capes, where the allied war- n
ships are hovering, in wait for the 8'
German submarine Deutschland, about 81
to leave Baltimore for Germany, and
the submarine Bremen, expected hour- w
ly from across the seas. The ^merlcan
war vessels went to sea yesterday ^
on orders from the Navy Department ?'
after a vessel purporting to be & Brit- ^
ish warship had passed Into Chesapeake M
bay and out again in the early morn- r?

Officials were silent as to Just what
instructions went to the North Caro- 8t
Una. It was assumed, however, its J*1
commander was ordered to see that the la
Mibmarines were not attacked within V
the three-mile limit, and that American
neutrality was not otherwise violated.
Ordered to Neutrality Duty.
The armored cruiser North Carolina and fl
three destroyers were ordered yesterday
to neutrality duty off Cape Henry. This 8
action by the Navy Department Is sup- s|
posed to have been taken as a result of ci

PENSIONING OF FIREMEN "
IS A FEATURE OF REPORT
Committee of Rational Board of Underwriter!
Also Urges a Local
Retirement System.
More liberal pensions and an age
limit for compulsory retirement would
lead to higher efficiency in the District
fire department, according to the committee
on fire prevention of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters,
which has just issued its annual report
for Washington.
Provision for the pensioning of firemen
in the National Capital is less than
in any other large city, the report states.
The committee's reference to the pension
matter is of particular interest at
this time in view of the fact that the
House District committee is now working
on a firemen's pension bill which is
expected to be reported out In a few
days.
Conditions Generally Commended.
The report goes thoroughly into local
conditions, giving a detailed description
of the water supply, the fire department
and auxiliaries, structural conditions
and hazards, electrical service
and other features connected with the
problem of fire prevention.
In its summary on the fire department
the report says, in part:
"The fire department is a strong,
fairly well equipped and mainly effective
force, under good supervision.
Appropriations for maintenance and
Improvements have been fairly liberal
and the department is gradually becoming
motorized. The personnel is
mainly of young, active men, but a
number of members are of an age and
length of service which merit retirement."
Additional Fire Boxes Needed.
In Its general summary the committee
finds that the water supply of the
District is adequate and generally reliable;
that the fire department is well
organized and mainly effective; that
the fire alarm system is well maintained
and reliable, but that additional
boxes are needed.
It declares the building laws to be
generally comprehensive, though deficient
in some important particulars,
especially protection to floor openings
and windows, and that the regulations
concerning explosives and inflammables
are mainly good, though not
sufficiently inclusive.
There is good municipal control of
electricity, the committee states, with
inside wiring mainly good. The committee
makes a number of recommendations
for reducing the Are hazard,
to which the Commissioners will give
consideration.

way Employes of America, the c
motormen and conductors of all c
the street railways in the city P
may be asked to join the trolley s

pected to come from Detroit to ii
take charge of the situation. a
"It would be a big job to organize
the men in this great city," said Patrick
O'Bryan. vice president of the u
employes' national association,, "but ii
it is not an impossibility. New York ?

Claim Men Were Intimidated. ^
All the trolly cars on 150 miles of r
trackage in the Bronx stopped running
at 8 o'clock last night. The street
railway company insisted that there
had been no strike in that borough, t
and that most of the men who stayed t>
away from work did so because they v
were intimidated by union organizers. t
Edward A. Maher, general manager of
the Union Railroad Company, asserted a
that the trouble might extend to all F
surface lines in Manhattan if the police a
did not give the employes' better protection.
t
The employes demand the right to
join the national organization, and F
seek an increase in pay of 5 cents an t
hour and better working conditions. b
The company's attempt to resume F
operations of cars in the Bronx at 8 p
o'clock this morning resulted in serious
disorder. At one point heavy
stones were piled on the tracks.
Several altercations between strikers
and carmen occurred and many per- A
sons were arrested. L
Police Beserves Summoned.
The second serious outbreak occurred jj
shortly after noon today when a mob of s
several hundred strikers and sympathizers
attacked a West Plains car in the q
Bronx. Bricks were hurled atthe car.

Police reserves and ambulances were
summoned. ?
g
When the police had succeeded in
checking the demonstration, it was dis- a
covered that no one was seriously hurt. *1
About a dozen persons were arrested.

decidedly optimistic over the prospect v*
of Washington escaping a serious epi- or
demic of the disease.
They believe that the prompt re- M;
sponse of citizens to the Commission- by
ers* appeal to clean up the city, "swat" ai
the fly and follow other precautionary fu
methods is largely responsible for the ve
fact that the malady has gained such
little headway here.
Recoveries Almost Complete. x
The patients discharged are said to
be practically normal, with only slight jr
evidences of paralysis. All four remaining
cases are of mild form.
Health department inspectors today
recommended the prosecution of an additional
lunchroom proprietor for al- th>
leged failure to comply with the regu- go
iations requiring protection of food
igainst flies. Seven complaints of this
character have been listed for prosecu- pa
tion, and three of the cases probably ye
will come up for trial in Police Court i01
tomorrow.

of Gen. Sir Douglas Haig in
linching his hold upon Pozieres,
ossession of which was neceaary
to a further advance toward
lapaume, his objective.
There was great activity,
hroughout the night by the Britjh
artillery, apparently in prepration
for a renewal of the atack.
The Germans in reply are
sing quantities of gas and eyerritating
shells, evidently in eforts

of the British infantry,
ihich is being kept in close touch

.ondon, July 27.?The French and Brttjh,
giving themselves no rest, are coninuing
their efforts to widen the eaekke
position north and south of the

ation of artillery which Germany hat

theater.
The great allied offensive has not
vailed to check the rich harvest of the 4
?rtile lands in the occupied French
rovinces. The German soldier, wieldr
of the sword and plowshare, too, has
lanted the fields right up to the line
f trenches, and not the least striking
npression of the long automobile tour
lade by the Associated Press correpondent
on the front of Picardy an^

rmy soldier-harvesters swinging crales
in broad fields of ripened rye*
lading stacked sheaves into wagona
nd feeding the threshing machines in
tter disregard of the great battle
Iging almost within rifle shot.
Sometimes within actual range soliers
in some instances reaped the crop
nder the flre of their enemy.
The crack guard regiment gathered
crop of hay from a field so close to
le French that the grass could be
it only at night and carried back to
acant fields, where it could be spread
nd cured. ?.
Harvest Worth the Bisk.
The harvest will be well worth the
sk. Great fields of wheat* oats, rye
ad potatoes, all showing remarkably
?od condition, despite the lack of
tiflcial fertilizers, were to be seen
i every hand. The wheat and rye
