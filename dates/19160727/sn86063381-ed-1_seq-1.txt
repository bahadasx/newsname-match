of the highway yesterday. They ar
rived in this city last evening from
the state park on their trip to Win
nipeg and greeted their highway
neighbors here
It is the idea of the promoters of
the Jefferson highway to make it as
"one big street" with every person
along it a neighbor to every other
person Such was the greeting Be
midji gave last night to the highway
officials, a greeting of neighbor, al
though some of the neighbors lived
a thousand miles down the street.
The people of the "Pines" welcomed
the people of the "Palms."
Never before in the history of Be
midji has so much enthusiasm been
shown about a highway and good
roads One prominent enthusiast
last night stated on the arrival of
the highway officials that if the
present enthusiasm for good roads is
kept alive in Bemidji, before sev
eral years pass Bemidji will be the
scene of some of the best roads in
the country.
Make Good Time.
The highway party was given a
"royal" welcome at Park Rapids
yesterday afternoon and a large
party of autoists from that town es
corted the officials to the state park.
The party arrived at the state park
at 4-50 o'clock and after a "sight
seeing" trip through the park was
served supper at Douglas lodge. At
the park the party was met by F. S
Lycan, chairman of the highway
committee in Bemidji, A. P. White
and a party of Bemidji people. The
party left the park for Bemidji at
about 6-30 o'clock and the roads
were so good that one car is reported
to have made the distance in one
hour and three minutes.
Eighty automobiles, valued at
about $100,000, occupied by several
hundred people welcomed the tour
ists to Bemidji.
The cars were lined up from Am
erica avenue on Fourth street to Bel
trami avenue and on Beltrami av
enue to the Markham hotel. When
the tourists passed the cars, the Be
midji autoists honked their horns,
bells were rung and lusty cheers
were given At the hotel the band
greeted them with spirited music
It was a wonderful welcome, accord
ing to one of the officials of the Jef
ferson highway.
Southerners in Party.
The highway party was composed
of the following men: J. Clark
son, Walter Parker, New Orleans
S Wolstencroft, Des Moines, pub
licity manager of the highway Paul
Nesbitt, Macalester, Okla president
of the Oklahoma Jefferson Highway
association Paul Russell, Paola,
Kan. O. England, Bethany, Mo., and
Edward Alderman, Nevada, Mo.
After the party had registered at
the Hotel Markham they were es
corted by the Bemidji autoists to the
Birchmont Beach hotel where they
were entertained and where they
entertained. Several hundred
Bemidji people attended the enter
tainment.
C. W. Jewett, president of the
Minnesota Retail Automobile Deal
ers' association, presided. In a short
introductory talk he thanked the of
ficials for selecting the Bemidji route.
"We thoroughly appreciate the
route," he said, "and Bemidji is go
ing to keep the route by fulfilling all
conditions required of it."
Clarkson Gives Talk.
D. Clarkson, general manager of
the Jefferson Highway association,
introduced the members of the high
way party. In a short address, in
which he addressed the Bemidji peo
ple as neighbors of the Jefferson
highway, he said that 2,500 Jefferson
highway signs had been ordered and
will be distributed along the trail in
Minnesota. The tin sign shows a
palm and a pine tree in green on a
white background and reads "From
New Orleans to Winnipeg." Tele
phone poles will also be marked.
"We are gratified at the reception
that has been given us all along the
road," said Mr. Clarkson. "It cer
tainly makes us feel at home. In

PIONEER EDITOR
GOES TO WINNIPEG
F. Neumeier, editor of the
Pioneer, left today to accom
pany the Jefferson highway
officials on their trip to Win
nipeg. He will write a series
of special articles on the trip
and will tell how enthusiastic
the Canadian people are in re
gard to the highway.
The Pioneer believes that
the Jefferson highway is one
of the biggest projects before
the people of this section to
day and in order to give its
readers an idea of the route
from here north, sends Editor
Neumeier on this trip.
Watch for these articles.
The first will appear in the
Pioneer tomorrow.
miles long it is nice to be able to feel
at home at any place along the
route. Along the entire way we
have been met with wonderful en
thusiasm. Up to the time we ar
rived in Bemidji 3,572 cars have es
corted us or lacking 28 of an aver
age of 800 a day."
Always on Schedule.
He told of how the trip originated
at St Joseph, Mo and how the party
had kept up its schedule. The party
up to the time it reached St. Paul
had not been one-half minute behind
its schedule. The party expects- to
maintain its schedule despite rain
and wet roads.
Mr. Clarkson told of an experience
near Staples where the road was not
in the best of condition. He was de
layed a short time and when he ar
rived at Staples he told several of
the road boosters about it. When
he arrived at the next stop, at Wa
dena, he was handed a telegram from
Staples business men stating that
they had raised $2,000 to repair the
roads. This $2,000 was raised while
the Jefferson highway party went 22
miles, and the highway party trav
eled at a fast rate of speed. That,
according to Mr. Clarkson, is one of
the best examples of enthusiasm that
he has met with along the Minne
sota route.
New Orleans Ready.
Walter Parker, manager of the
Board of Commerce of New Orleans,
in an address said that Louisiana
stood ready to do its share in hard
surfacing the Jefferson highway. He
said that New Orleans plans to have
a highway approach the city on a 100
mile splendidly paved turnpike, lined
on each side with "great palms. He
stated that besides the Jefferson
highway five great continental high
ways were being constructed. In
side of a few years it is planned to
ask the state of Louisiana for $20,-
000,000 for the construction of good
roads. He stated that when he ar
rived in Winnipeg he would connect
up the mayor of Winnipeg and the
mayor of New Orleans, neighbors,
over the telephone.
Praises Scenic Advantages.
Paul Nesbitt, Macalester, Okla.,
president of the Oklahoma Jefferson
Highway association, in an eloquent
address praised the scenic advantages
of Minnesota. He told of the advan
tages of the highway which would
extend from the snows of Canada to
the orange groves of Louisiana.
"The whole thing is more than a
mere highway," he said, "it is more
than you can imagine unless you
have traveled over it." He sang an

UNITED STATES
PROTEST S BLAC
LIST METHOD S
Washington, July 27.The Amer
ican note answering the British
blacklist action was forwarded to
London last night, according to
Counsellor Polke of the state depart
ment.
The note was divided into two
parts. First, it insisted on a spe
cific guarantee as to the affect the
blacklist would have on American
firms and secondly the whole prin
ciple of such boycott be gone into.
The United States resists England's
contention of her right of going into
it, and asks for specific guarantees at
once. The matter of principle to be
gone into later.
It also demanded that blacklisted
firms be allowed their standing con
tracts and collect their standing
debts and that there be no exten
sion of the blacklist to American
firms dealing with blacklisted firms
neutral countries or in the United
States And also that blacklisted
firms be not prevented from dealing
with neutral countries, particularly
South America. The note will be
given out for publication Monday.

its action of yesterday, the senate to

men while at the horder.

Wilson today signed the rivers and

an appropriation of $42,000,000.
AMERICAN WARSHIPS TO
WATCH THREE MILE ZONE
Washington, July 27 Aroused by
an official report from the command
er of the battleship Louisiana that a
mysterious ship purporting to be a
Brltrshncrtfise^niad ptissed into the
mouth of Chesapeake bay early Tues
day mofnfng, -the navy "department
ordered the armored cruiser" North
Carolina and three destroyers to neu
trality duty off Cape Henry.
Officials maintained unusual secrecy
regarding the matter and would not
disclose j'ust what instructions were
sent to the commander of the North
Carolina.
Strange Proceeding.
Unofficially navy officers agree that
if the ship sighted from the Louisiana
was a British cruiser, the commander
of the vessel had been guilty of a
breach of naval practice and had vio
lated navigation laws in cruising
within American waters without
proper lights. While it was conced
ed that the cruiser was within her
rights in entering territorial waters,
provided*she had observed the rules,
it was declared an attempt to run
the bay on a scouting expedition and
in disregard of navigation laws would
constitute a gross violation of inter
national courtesy.
London, July 27 Within the next
few days the advanced British lines
must withstand the Germans' most
powerful counter attacks since the
allied offensive was started. Newly
won positions at Pozieres will be the

There is-a-feverish activity along the
allied lines ,in throwing up entrench

have gained so that they can success

no further forward drive by the
Anglo-French forces.
Mercedes, Tex., July 27.It was1

all are out of danger. Only a few

Stores Ready May Mean Sav
ing in Cost of Overhead.
Bemidji is to have a Union de~-
livery system. The purpose of such
a system is cut down the overhead
cost of doing business and permit the
merchant to sell goods for less to his
customers. The system to be in
stalled in Bemidji will be the Law
rence Union delivery system by auto
mobile.
The idea or plan is to cover the city
with one car for various merchants.
The same number of deliveries for
the present will be continued by those
stores who have decided to enter in
to the new arrangement provided it
is launched here.
The following stores have decided
to adopt the new system if Mr. Law
rence decides to begin operations:
W. Schroeder, Stewart's Grocery
and F. Troppman's Department
store Others may enter the new
method as soon as it is thoroughly ~3f
tried out and found satisfactory.
This system is now in force in
Grand Rapids and other towns where
reports state they are giving good
satisfaction. Mr. Lawrence expects i
to start about August 15. He spent^.
