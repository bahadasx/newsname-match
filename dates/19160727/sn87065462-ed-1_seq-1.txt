No. 31.

The Rural I redits Law.
In signing the above a-2t Pres
ident Wilson-coupled with ex
pression of gratification a timely
caution against "extravagant j
expectations, " which ' T h e j
Herald echoes with emphasis, j
The President, according t o
reports of remarks we refer to,
said: "I look forward to the be
nefits of this bill not with ex
travagant expectation, but with
confident expeetion that it will
be of advantage to the investing
community, for I can imagine no
. i . i ii '
I more sausiaciory ana sona in-
vestments than this system will
afford those who hnve money to
use."
While it may be confidently
accepted that the system ii a'. I
it should be, we are so sui e of
the immediate general attain
ment of the necessary familariu
of farmers with its terms and
provisions. And untill t!i?v i
thorough understanding here,
opo-.t'ions and adaiita.s of
the j.tw most needs be delayed.
For liu convenience and under
standing of the general public
the following epitome of the law
will be found convenient:
Washington, July 17. Here
is what a farmer who needs
money can do under the rural
credits bill, which was signed
today by the President:
First, he must join what is to
be known as a National Farm
Loan Association, paying in So
for one of its shares for each
$100 he wishes to borrow. He
has one vote a share, but not to
exceed ten votes in ail.
Next, he applies to the
association for the loan, giving
his .personal note therefor,
secured by a first mortgage on
his farm. If the association
approves the loan, it turns the
note mortgage to a land burnt.
The land bank sends the amount
of the loan to the association,
which hands the monev to the
If farmer. No commission, brok
it i tp : ,.u., l u..
eraxe ur rie-uu ta (.diiikuu me
borrower.
No single loan is to be for less
than $100 or more than $10,000;
nor for less than five years or
more than forty years. The
loan must not exceed 00 per cent
and preferable should not go be
yond 50 per cent of the market
value of the land covered by the
mortgage.
The borrower pays, semi-an
nuaily, the interest plus an
instalment of the principal. He
must not be charged over 0 per
cent interest.
Each National Farm Loan
Association must have at least
ten members, and it cannot be
gin business with less than $20,
000 in loans applied for.
It is illegal under severe pen
alties, for an officer, committee
man or member to accept any
commission, fee or perquisite of
any kind for granting any loan.
The only paid offiicer is a secre
tary treasurer.
Money can be borrowed by
this system in order to pay for
agricultural land, equipment,
fertilizer, live stock, buildings
and improvement, or to dis
charge a prior mortgage.

passage and benefits, that there J
is a large chance or indulgence
of the "extravagant anticipa
tion" against which the prsi-
dont has raised his voice
such writer is quoted: "The
federal farm loan act will bene
fit ten people where the reserve
act benefitted one, and the bene
fit in each case wfll be some
thing like ten-fold as compared
to that of the reserve act. This
is particularly true in the South
where the farmers are paying a
higher rate of interest than in
almost any other part of the
country." We may be over
pessimistic, but we feel it is in
order to say that the terms of
the bill dj nit justify sj :1i ex
travagant claims.
Another anticipation is quoted:
"The enactment of this law
presents an achievement in fojr
years that is aim st unparallel
ed. A definite need existed, but
the term rural credits and the
systems in successful operation
in Europe were little understood
by the mases of the people of
this country. While admitting
the "existence of a definite
need" it may be questioned if
the need as understood by the
necessitous will be fulfilled.
Not only is there a want of the
European "understanding o f
the rurnl credits terms and
system." but little is known, by
"farmers of the South particu
larly," of the European condi
tion, the thrift and habits of
economic thought and practice,
that accompany and precede the
rural credits system; that fitted
the European peasantry, and
are essential in fitting American
farmers, for its benefits. Vicks-

Farmers Should Not Be
Discouraged
July 26, 1916.
Dear Editor:
On my return to the state a
few days ago, I find a spirit of
relessness almost to the point of
despair among the negro farmers
of this section and throughout
the state, wh'erever floods and
winds have damaged or ruined
the crops; so much so, that there
are those who are
planning to go to other agricul
tural states or to states where
they can secure public work.

more than the rate it gets on its
bonds. This margin of on point
is to cover expenses and profits.
It will be noted that the first
step toward realizing the bene
fits of the rural credits act is the
formation of Farm Loan Associa-
tion. It may be safely said that
the enactment is a praiseworthy
. consumation of .a long pending
policy. But so much has been

One of its readers has address
ed the Times-Picayune, askinir
that information be published
concerning the various military
units in the United States army.
He wants information regarding
infantry, cavalry, artillery, bri
gade and a division.
A company of -infantry is a
body of foot soldiers composed
of 00 men, peace strength, and
about 140 men war strength.
Four companies form a battallion
and 3 battallions form a regi
ment. The war strength of the
regiment is about 1642 officers
and men. A company is com
manded by a captain, a regiment
by a colonel.
A troop of cavalry is a body of
mounted soldiers, used princi
pally for scout duty and , to pro
tect the infantry while engaged.
Like the company of infantry,
it is composed of 65 to 100 men.
Four troops form a squadron and
three squadrons a regiment a
cavalry. The war strength of
such a regiment is about 12S6
officers and men.
A battery of artillery is com
posed of 4 to 6 guns, manned by
6 or 7 men each. Three batteries I
form a battallion and two battal
lions form a regiment of field
artillery. The war strength of
such a regiment is about 1227
officers and men.
Three regiments form a bri
gade. Three brigades, comple
mented by such artillery and
other troops as may be assigned
to them form a division, which is
commanded by a major-general.

My power is limitless, my

I guarantee those who possess
me prosperity and success.
I have exalted those of low

have found me a helpful friend.
To obtain me you need put out
no capital but personal effort,
and on all you invest in me I

Here about Okolona the dis
couragement is just as pro
nounced. Poor farmers are say
ing tnat they cannot pay their
debts, or even feed their fami
lies, and that they cannot stand
the strain any longer.
In the history of Spain is
clearly demonstrated the folly of
a working class of people leaving
a good territory to try another
which was better in promise
on!y. until they got there. It
ruined" the working people who
left, and Set back the progress
the state many centuries. The
fact is, Spain has never fully re
covered from this blunder. 1
am writing therefore to appeal
on the one hand to our white
citizens to baar with the troubles!
in which the poor farmer at this
time finds himself; and on the
other hand, I am trying to ap

A statement that will undoubt
ly be of unusual interest to every
body in Mississippi was made a
few days ago at the McAmis
drug store in Corinth by J. H.
Veedon, who lives on the R. F.
D. from this city and is one of
the most successful and pro
gressive planters in this part of
the country. Mr. Weedon is a
man of wide influence and ac
quaintance, and his evidence on
any subject is considered of such
high order as to be beyond
question.
In' telling of his remarkable
restoration to health thruugh the
use of Tanlac, Mr. Weedon says
"I have taken three bottles of
this medicine and it has done me
so much good I am buying five
more today. That shows just
what I think of it as a medicine.
"I suffered from a bad from
of indigestion for a number of
years, " he con tinued. ' 'and had
tried various other remidies
without any lasting good coming
from any of them. I would have
sour stomach continually and
everything I ate would ferment
and swell and give me a great
deal of misery and injurious dis
comfort.
"I had seen this Tanlac highly
recommended, and I made up my
mind that it was worth a trial.
After having taken the very first
bottle the swelling left me and
the fermentation stooped. I
soon got so I could eat anything;
I wanted without its bothering i
"Statements from men like
Mr. Weedon leave nothing else
to be done in that section to
establish the merit of this great
medicine; because the best evi
dence of a medicine's power is
what those who have actually
taken it have to say about it.
This is especially true and be
yond all question when these
statements are made by people
of prominence and high charac
ter and published right in the
communities where each and
every fact can be investigated
and verified.
"Such indorsements and such
satisfactory results explain why
the people of Corinth and that
entire section are purchasing
Tanlac until the sales are now
breaking all records. In Meri
dian, Mississippi, alone one firm
has actually sold nearly 5,000
bottles -4, 356. to be absolutely
correct since January 22nd of
this year, and we are now ad
vised by the leading druggists
of that city that the demand is
growing to enormous proportions
and that it is a hard matter to
keep supplied."
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in Houlka exclusively by J.
