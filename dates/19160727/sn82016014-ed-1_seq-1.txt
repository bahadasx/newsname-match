In view ef the interest generated by
the oil boom, engineers in charge of
the survey here refuse to make any
statement regarding their work. The
result of their investigation in the
county will not be made known until
a report is issued by the interior de

(While activity of local oil promoters
is believed to be responsible for the
interest suddenly manifested by the
government in geologic conditions in
Shawnee county, the survey will not
be limited to investigation of the oil
situation. Possibility of various min
eral deposits in northeast Kansas also
are co be investigated, it is said. The
local survey is in charged of O. L.
Brace. He will be assisted by M. G.
Cheney.
Interest in the oil situation in Shaw
nee county gained considerable im
petus when it became known that
eastern capitalists were obtaining
leases on land in the county. F. W.

Opportunity to Come In Under
Permanent Road Act.
IMMEDIATE ACTION NECESSARY
Budget Must Be Included in the
Sew Tax Levies.
W. S. Gearhart Will Be Recog
' nized as Head of Work.
Kansas county commissioners may
provide, in their new levy, for imme
diate participation under provisions of
the federal aid law. That was the an
i.ouncement made today by Governor
Capper, following receipt of a letter
from W. S. Gearhart, state highway
engineer. .Five Kansas counties have
already applied to Gearhart for per
mission to come under the federal act
In the building of permanent high
ways. Gearhart has received announce
ment from Washington which places
him in charge of the work in this state
pending a formal act or me legisla
ture. Following the acceptance sent
to federal officials by Governor Cap
per, the government now recognizes
Kansas in the distribution of funds
under the recent act of congress. Sev
eral days ago Governor Capper noti
fied federal departments that Kansas
would operate under provisions of the
new law.
Must Act at Once.
Counties which desire federal aid
in the building of permanent roads
must make immediate provisions.
That was the warning which Gearhart
today sent to Topeka. In order to par
ticipate under the new government
appropriation, the county commission
ers must include tnelr permanent
highway budget in the new tax levies.
These levies will be made in a few
days. For that reason Gearhart urged
Governor Capper to recommend im
mediate action by all counties Inter
ested in the plan.
Five .counties have already made
formal application to Gearhart for
permission- to - participate under the
appropriation. Names of these coun
ties have not been made public. It
is believed, however, that numerous
other counties will seek portions of
the appropriation as soon as terms of
the federal law are fully understood.
Action is Temporary.
Federal departments have notified
Gearhart that the state highway en
gineer will be recognized as head of
the state highway department, pend
ing action by the state legislature. The
recent letter by Governor Capper will
also permit the state to participate in
the federal fund. This action holds
merely until adjournment of the 1917
legislature. Next winter it will be
necessary for the legislature to make
provision for the creation of a state
highway department.
Officials directly interested in the
campaign for permanent highway
building have been urged to meet in
Washington August 16. It is probable
that Engineer Gearhart will attend the
meeting. At that time detailed plans
concerning government participation
in road building will be discussed.

stake this afternoon in the third game
of the local stand with Sioux City,
and both teams were expected to do
considerable perspiring in their effort
to step to the front. Although the
weather continues hot, the players
claim that the heat does not interfere
with their playing and that today's
game should prove as good as Wednes
day's. John Savage has returned from his
pitching talent hunt. While he had
no definite announcement to make, he
said he was satisfied he had several
good twlrlers on the string and that
he expected to land some of them
very shortly. It is thought he is en
deavoring to trade Collomore or Willis
to an American association club for
men who will be willing to come here
and work.
SHE SWALLOWS CHECK
It Was Evidence, Too, That Police
Had Against Colored Girl.
Helen Giay Floyd, colored check
artist, swallowed the evidence when
police officers attempted to arrest her.
The information telephoned to the po
lice station was that she was trying to
cash a bum check. Officers hurried to
the scene and when the Floyd worn
an saw them she put something into
her mouth. It was first feared that
she had taken poison but later it was
decided that she merely swallowed the
check.
She did not escape trouble by her
act for it is charged that on the pre
vious day she passed a worthless
check upon which the name of J. L.
Poyner had been forged, at the Pelle
tier store.
FINGER NAIL SCRATCH
: WAS CAUSE OF DEATH
London, July 27. Blood poison
from a scratch of a society girl's

to Cyrus Cuneo, the American
artist, a few days ago. This was
the medical testimony at an inquest
held here. Mr. Cuneo was a guest
at a farewell party. During a gen
eral romp one of the girls happened
to scratch Cuneo's nose.

Chicago, July 27. A period of in
tense heat in the western plains states
unequaled in continuity and extreme
high temperature since 1S01, the year
of the hot winds in Kansas, according
to the government weather bureau
here probably will continue through
the remaining days of July. The fore
caster announced today that no breeze
was stirring in the Canadian north
west, whence relief must come, and that
there was every indication that except
in spots visited by local showers the
drouth would be severely felt.
At 7 o'clock this morning Chicago
was the hottest point in the United
States with the exception of Yuma,
Ariz., with a temperature of 84. The
mercury reached 98 at noon and 100
was predicted for this afternoon.
The present heat wave began during
the last days of June and has contin
ued with an absence of rain that has
become a serious menace to crops in
Kansas and Oklahoma, while portions
of Illinois and Missouri have begun
to show the effects of heat and drouth.
Wisconsin, Iowa and part of Nebraska
are in need of relief. In Kansas the
heat has not been as destructive as in
1S01 because it has not been accom
panied by the hot winds of that pe
riod. Heat Records Smashed.
Chicago, July 27. The official tem
perature here at 11 o'clock today was
97, the highest of the season. Equally
high readings are general throughout
Illinois and Iowa. Blooroington, 111.,
reported 99 degrees; Quincy, 96;
Springfield, 94; Danville, 96; Ot
tumwa, Iowa, 96; Davenport, 96, and
Clinton, 97.
While reports of heat suffering
poured in from all parts of the middle
west and west today, the mercury con
tinued its upward climb. Another
scorcher was today's prediction by the
weather bureau. Unless mercury tum
bles quickly this will be the hottest
July in the history of plains states.
Worst Since 1871. .
Government records show the pres
ent heat wave is the longest since
1871 as far back as the records go.
The hottest spot in the United States
yesterday was Quincy, 111., where 105
i was reached. Pontiac. 111., registered
104. There were plenty of 90's.

Pontiac, 111.. July 27. The intense

today. James Kunkel, 25, and Wil

CHANCE FOR CASEMENT
British Justice Announces Judges Will

London. July- 27. Justice Darling
announced today that the five judges
who heard the appeal of Roger Case

possible application on behalf of the
convict. " The nature of the applica
tion has not been disclosed.
Justice Darling added ihat the
king's coroner had beer, told by those
representing Casement that it was de
sired to make an application to the
court of criminal appeal, but he had
heard from another source that it was
improbable the appiic ' - would be
made as the matter was uncertain and
they could not allow any uncertainty
in a question of this kind. The court,
he said, would sit tomorrow to hear

Skidding Auto in Ditch Fatal
for Robt. Smelser of Topeka.
Boy Allen and A. Romerman
Escaped Without Scratch.
Singing of four Oakland youths, on
their way home, in an Oakland auto
mdbile driven and owned by Robert
Smelser, 360 Winfield avenue, came
to a sudden stop early this morning
when the car struck a rut near the
Sardou avenue bridge, skidded and
turned over. At 3 o'clock this morn
ing, Smelser died at St. Francis hos
pital with broken ribs puncturing his
lungs. James "Pat" Mulligan, 418
Cedar street, is at Christ's1 hospital,
painfully but not seriously injured.
His back is wrenched and face and
body badly bruised. It was not until
8 o'clock this morning that Mulligan
regained consciousness. .
Robert Smelser, Oakland youth killed
in auto accident this morning.
Roy Allen, an employe of the Wolff
Packing company living at 418 For
est avenue, and A. Romerman. an
employe of the E. L. Overton electri
cal company, escaped without injury.
Allen stoutly denied this morning that
r.ny attempt was made after the acci
dent to hide the details or withhold
the names of either himself or Ro
merman, and declared they, accom
panied with an unknown Oakland
man called "Hughie," were the last to
leave.
No Candidate in Accident.
'The only reason we didn't give our
names." yaid Allen this morning, "was
because police and reporters there
didn't ask us. We didn't leave until
everything possible had been done for
Smelser and Mulligan and they had
both been taken to hospitals. The
report that a candidate was in the
bunch is not true."
The youths were bein taken home
by Smelser after a night of automo
bile riding and were singing and rid
ing fast, Allen stated this morning.
Allen, Mulligan and Romerman were
in the back seat. Suddenly the car
struck a rut and Smelser turned off
his engine. The car began skidding
and turned over.
Allen and Romerman jumped and
escaped without injuries..
Mulligan Was Unconscious.
"We found Mulligan and Smelser on
the other side of the car," said Allen.
"Smelser was a little out of his head
but apparently not badly injured. We
were frightened about Mulligan and
Romerman ran to a house and got
water for him"
Bert Miller, a driver for the Ander
son Auto Livery, came up and hur
ried td a nearby telephone from where
an ambulance was summoned. Mulli
gan was taken to the hospital in an
ambulance.
Peculiar breaching of Smeleer
alarmed the police and they took him
to the hospital. Gradually his condi
tion became more alarming and at i
o'clock this morning he died. Both
Smelser and Mulligan were thrown
about twenty feet from the car. The
machine was badly, damaged and im
bedded in the bank.
John Smelser, father of the youth,
stated this morning that Robert pur
chased the car about two months ago
and had been saving money for a

on the Somme, July 25. via Berlin,
July 26. To London, July 27. The
French and British, giving themselves
no rest are continuing their efforts
to widen the positions north and south
of the Somme where they are pinned
in on three. sides by German armies.
Both German officers and men are
confident of their ability to hold their
own and are aided by the most power
ful aggregation of artillery which
Germany has as yet accumulated in
any single battle theater.
Yesterday afte-noon, shortly after
the correspondents had left the battle
field an artillery duel of violent pro
portions signalized the renewal of the
struggle. From the intensity of the
bombardment, it was soon evident
that the main effort of the allies
would again be made on the line from
Pozieres to Hardecourt the sector
which was the scene of such bitter
fighting from July 20 to July 23.
The bombardment continued -7ith
increasing violence the whole after
noon. Toward evening an attack was
made in strong force by a British di
vision which was headed by picked
troops and bomb throwers.
The attackers were able to establish
a foothold in the German lines but
were later driven out by a German
counter attack. The British also suc
ceeded in entering temporarily the
German trench system in the vicinity
of Longueval and Guillemont but here
also were finally expelled.
General Foch supported his British
colleagues with a determined attack
south of the Somme. On the blood
drenched terrain between Estrees and
Soycourt he gained a few hundred
meters of front line trenches south of
Estrees but was unable to hold them.

Washington. July 27. Warning was

ment of infantile paralysis. .
Iepartment officials charged with

the outbreak of infantile paralysis
will tempt ' unscrupulous persons to
offer for sale so-called 'cure or rem

therefore have issued special instruc

Baltimore. Md., July 27. When the
German subsea freighter Deutschland
skims down the Patapsco for the
capes, en route home, a big British
tramp steamer, the Ardgryfe. is due
to follow her as a spy ship.
An officer of the watch boat ad
mitted today that "we plan to go out
when our friend over yonder does."
He was reticent about his purposes ;
though he admitted that he and his
Japanese crew are keeping a lookout I
"Look up our record In port," he
said.
That record showed only that he !
came in light; it did not tell where ,
she goes from here, or whether she i
will dog the submarine farther than :

The Ardgryfe carries a swarm of i
little brown men. They watch well. !
And the Ardgryfe's wireless can tell
tales if she wishes to take a chance
with the American neutrality rulos
and the radio inspector. Such things
have happened.
The Deutschland was still screened '.
today behind her barge protectors.
The tug Timmins was ready to tow
her.
Along the river watchers hoped she
would head out soon. A scorching
July sun turned the oily harbor to a
shimmering rainbow and backed the
spy line.

But with the vessel cleared, it
seemed to the spies that the Deutsch
land must at last plan a run for home.
The story in out that she would sail
before night. Her chances of safety
seemed more precarious with the al

brings fighting submarine convoys and
these may be the Deutschland's guard

The Deutschland promoters were
joyous over one point that the

Koenig. "if the British don't violate
