AGREE ITH ill
Washington T C. July 27 Pros
pects of an eraly agreement between
the American and Mexican govern
ments to submit the border disagree
ments to a joint commission were
described as b-ighter today after acting
secretary Polk again conferred wlh
Eliseo Arredondo. Gen. Carranxa's am
bassador. The Washington govern
ment wants to widen the scope of th
commission's Investigation beyond Gen.
Carranza's suggestion that it discuss
withdrawal of American troops, meas
ures to protect American border inter
est from bandits and the origin of
rams.
It was assumed that Mr Arredondo
was able to assure Mr Polk today that
his government was willing that tho
commissioners should investigate eco
nomic and financial relations betw-n
the two countries with the hope of
finding means to aid Mexico in tha
restoration of peace and order
There Is every reason to believe that
as a result of todays conference a
definite announcement -will soon be
possioie
A telegram from Gen Carranza to
the Mexican embassy stated Get
Jacinto Trevmo had not been removed
from command in Chihuahua and that
Gen. Luis Herrera still was his subo
dinate.
