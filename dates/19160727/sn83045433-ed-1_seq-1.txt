aginable.

exists. for remember; I should say at
least 93 per cent of the army are volun
teers, while the remainder really only
wanted their minds made up for them."

ground gained in the recent British ad
vance was worth the losses in men.

2,000 INNOCENT
IRISH ABUSED,
COMMONS TOLD
Leader Charges Cruelty Sur
passing that of Germany
Toward Belgians.
(By the Interatiemal News Service.)
London, July 26.-rn the house of corn
mons today Timothy Healy. one of the
Irish leaders, charged that of the three
thousand men and women arrested in
connection with the Irish rebellion, two
thousand were innocent and were treated
with a cruelty and ferocity that even
Germany had not shown to Belgium.
The home secretary, he charged, by his
administration had started the Sinn Fein
organization in Ireland, and therefore
was the father of the movement. Called
to order, Mr. Healy concluded by charg
ing the home secretary with maligmant
treatment of the prisoners.
W. Field, National!st member of Par
liament for St. Patricks, said if the gov
ernment wished Irishmen's assistance in
fighting it must give them fair play.
That wasall they wanted.
Later Home Secretary Samuel, defend.
ing the administration of Gen. Maxwell,
the commander-in-chief of the British
forces in Ireland. said there was no justi
fication for the charges against the mili
tary of a blood thirsty desire for kill
ing's sake. He did n.ot propose to hold
lany further inquiries into the deaths.
He ended that 1.2(- out of the 3V) per
sons arrested had been released. Eighty
two women had been released and only
two were held as prisoners. Many pris
nners, he said, would be released, as they
were only the dupes of the leaders and
very few will be detained for long.
WOULD BOOST
MILITIA'S PAY
Officers Want Men Given the
Same "Extras" Drawn Now
by U. S. Regulars.
E=orts will be made by militia oMcers
at Camp Ordway to obtain for the Dis
trict soldiers all the pay and allowances
given the men of the regular army, it
was learned at Camp Ordway last night.
Extra pay for length of service, in
creased pay for rifle qualifncation, and
many allowances not now given the
militia will be sought. A decision of the
Comptroller of Treasury will probably
be necessary to obtain a construction of
the law, to this effect.
The officers of the supply company of
the Third Infantry have discovered that
a regular at the time of his first enlist
ment. is entitled to a full toilet outfit
free of charge, and that each company
is entitled to a barber kit. Many little
things, all allowed to them by law, will
be demanded for the District troops.
That the militiaman is entitled to the
treatment accorded the regular after he
becomes a part of the organized militia.
is shown by section Cl of the United
States Army Regulations, which state
that "the militia, when called into the
actual service of the United States, is en
titled to the same pay and allowances as
are, or may be, provided by law, for the
regular army, and pay and allowances
commence from the day on which the
militia appear at the company ren
dezvous."

show that the British cruiser transgressed
