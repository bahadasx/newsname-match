"They pot more than you did tonight,"
chimed In the orderly.
"And by the way." continued the
host, "you don't pee any starving men
ait Styx. I give yon my word the average
man here la fed better than at
home. Why. this morning I had a
piece of beefsitwik that was fit for a
king. No better In Columbia. Now
we certainly appreciate the iiutereat
of the good women of the state t.i
sending the delicacies to camp, but
1 must say that the soldiers are being
well fed."
The gueat was delighted with the
military supper and promised to return
for another meal.
"Yes." mused a private, after the
guest had left the officers' mess, "a
few phonograph records, some magazines
and county papers would be
just as highly appreciated as rich
food."
Urges Troop Movement.
Gov. Manning took up the matter of
moving the National Guard of South
Carolina to the Mexican border with
the Washington government. Lottery
urging that an early movement
be ordered were addressed by Gov.
Manning to the socrotary of war and
the president.
No word has been received at Camp
Styx as to when the guard will be
moved. The officers aro straining
every nerve to put the First Regiment
in condition as required by the
new order of the war department.
Gov. Manning sent the following
letter to Newton D. Baker secretnry
of war:
"We have now ip camp here two
regiments of infantry and one troon
of cavalry, which have been reported
an ready to go to the border by the
United States array officers.
"These commands are well officered
and have a line personnel. Both
officers and men are extremely anxious
to see service, and I write to
urge you to do all In your power to
have these troops go forward at once.
There Is no question In my mind
that they will do creditable service
both for the United States and the
State of South Carolina.
"This State responded promptly to
the president's call. The troops are
In excellent condition, and are ready
and anxious to go forward. Their
prompt movement to the border will
serve as a stimulus to the National
Guard of South Carolina, and I am
particularly anxious to encourage this
spirit.. Please advise me when they
will move."
Word reached Camp Styx from Columbia
that Gov. Manning had sent a
letter to President Wilson and the
war department urging that the two
regiments be sent to the bonier at an
early day was received with pleasure
by the men and officers of the National
Guard.
Plans went forward for tlio oistnh.
lishmcnt of recruiting, stations in
South Cnrolinn for the militia. Tentative
plans call for the establishment
of stations at Columbia. ' Florence.
Spartanburg and Greenville. Coast
artillery offic ers have been summoned
to ^nip and will be detailed as recruiting
officers.
The men of the First regiment have
bee i working hard to get into condition
for moving to the border, and if
the. ? are a few more rough edges to
be ground off it will not matter, bocause
t'he guardsmen are willing. The
matter of equipment will of course he
left to the federal officers, and it is
believed that everything possible will
be done to expedite the movement of
th troops.
The men of the Second regimont
are working hard to get In condition
for the/much desired and much taJk/
ed about trip
\VhiIo no announcement has been
made, it is believed that effort is being
mado to have the troops moved
at the earliest possible moment. The
matter may be handled directly with
the secretary of war.
Military Race Horses.
Napoleon once remarked tha/t an
army moved on lt9 stomach.
Camp Moore is being gradually
rounded Into a real military ramp. It
is requiring much work to bring the
desired result and the officers are
pleased with the way things are working
and the general appearance of
the camp.
"Life at Camp Moore la agreeing
with the men." said an ofTicer. "Ju?t
look tit ihe ruddy fare*. The ?allow
look of the men from the offices and
mills ha* disappeared."

Companies from Spartanburg. Rock

company from Anderson participated.
The men were given much applause
as they tiled peas the large number of |
visitors and soldiers from other com- ,
panics.
The machine gun company participated
in target practice on the rifle
range, some good scores being recorded.
Word is expected from Washington
any day concerning the request, of
Gov. Manning that some statement bo
made as to when the troops will l?e
moved. The letter of the governor
was addressed to the president and '
the secretary of war.
An effort will be made to recruit the ;
two South Carolina regiments in the '
National Guard of the United States
up to full war strength?150 men tr> j
the company?in the opinion of W. W.
Moore, adjutant general. Recruiting
i offlres will be opened at an early date
at Greenville, Spartanburg. Columbia
and Florence. Officers and men from ;
the coast artillery will be detailed for i
service at these stations. The list oT j
officers for each station has not yet
been announced.
No definite dates have been fixed \
for the annual encampment of the 1
coast artillery, according to W. W.
Moore, adjutant general. The matter
of fixing the dates Is being handled 1
by the war department. The coast ,
artillery companies are located at
Greenville. Spartanburg, Greenwood,
Gaffney and Jonesvllle.
J. S. Caldwell Resigns.
Declaring that he had been aocusi
ed of disloyalty, J. Shapter Caldwell,
1 assistant adjutant general, has mail- |
i e<l his resignation to W. W. Moore, |
i adjutant general.
"I have not received the resignation
and will give it consideration
; when I do," snid the adjutant general,
i just before leaving for Barnwell,
where he attended the campaign
meeting.
When the National Guard was ordered
mobilized at Styx, MaJ. Caldwell
was appointed as camp adjutant.
His resignation does not affect his j
position as camp adjutant.
MaJ. Caldwell mailed the following
I letter to the adjutant genoral:
"I respectfully request that I be
granted a two months leave, to which
I am entitled by law, and that at the j
expiration of this leave I bo relieved
from duty as assistant to the adjutant
general."
The law requires that the resigna- '
tion be transmitted to the governor |
through the adjutant general. Gov- 1
Manning had no comment to make
concerning he resignation of Maj.
Caldwell.
Hope of an early movement to the
border having been practically aban- |
doned by the officers and men of the
I National Guard, the inhabitants of this
; military village will now settle down
to regular routine work.
When the troops were first mobilized
the one big idea in the minds of the
officers was to equip every company
and make ready for ail early move
on the border. This fond hope having
gono glimmering the men will now be I
put through stiff drills every day. The
| officers intended to train the men in j
! the ar*t of warfare nftor Miev
i reached the concentration camp 'some- j
| whore in Texas." Since the recent orI
der of the war department, it is evi- |
! dent that the more than 2.000 young
; men will be Riven their training right ,
1 here at home. In other words, if the !
men are sent to the border they will
go as first class soldiers, fit and ready
for any performance outlined by the j
I commandcr-ln-chief.
It means hard work. It means that
! the men will spend a very active sum- j
rner. all the better for the hard work. ;
Word has ben passed around that the
hard work orders are soon to be issued. !
There was talk of long hikes with
stops over night and many hours of i
hard drilling.
Maj. R. F. Watson's battalllon of the j
First infantry gave a dress parade on
the rifle range.
Rifle practice has begun on the
range which runs up to 1.001 yards.
The entire engineer company, which
was recently mustered into the Fed
era! sendee, was inoculated with anti
I typhoid scrum.
The Border.
"V~hon arc you going to the border?"
an officer was asked, and like
the private, he replied: "i don't
know."
The officers are pleaded with the
spi'lt of the men and tho n.or are 1

TO CUT ARMY BILL
CALLS HALT TO WHOLESALE
REDUCTIONS IN APPROPRIATION
BILL.
DEBATES ON PREPAREDNESS
Would be Unwise to Limit Expenditure
for Ammunition and Guns Despite
Lessening Tension In Mexican
Situation.
Washington.?The Senate called a
halt on wholesale reductions begun
a few days ago in the army appropriation
bill, voting down retrenchment
proposals and approving Increases totalling
more than $30,000,000 when
sections were reached carrying provision
for ordnance and equipment for
the regular army and National Guard.
Debate on the ordnance sections developed
a predominating sentiment
that it would be unwise to limit expenditures
for ammunition and guns too
closely, despite lessening of tension in
the Mexican situation. Decreases of
$36,000,000 related to transportation,
subsistence, foreign service pay and
emergency estimates put into the bill
by the House when tho Mexican situation
was critical. New increases included
:
For medical supplies, increase from
$2,000,000 to $4,500,000; engineers j
equipment. $1,000,000 to $1,770,000; 1
ordnance stores $6,000,000 to $11,000.- i
OrtO; automatic machine guns for reg- |
uiar army. $;u?oii.ooo to $7,725,000; automatic
machine guns for National
Guard. $2,000,000 to $6.5S6,150; armored
motor cars. $300,,000 to $1,000.000;
flold artillery for National Guard,
$S,G00,O00 to $14,200,000; ammunition
for National Guard. field artillery,
$8,000,000 to $14,000,000.
In the item for small arms ammunition
the Senate approved a reduction
from $5,000,000 to $2,500,000 but several
senators said they would insist
on another vote on the section before
the final passage of the bill.
CREW HOLDS COMMUNION
FOR SAFETY OF U-BOAT.
Deutschland Partly Submerged at j
Her Slip at Baltimore and Ready
For Dash.
Baltimore.?A communion service
was held aboard the interned North
Gorman Lloyd steamer Neckar, lying i
alongside the submarine Deutschland,
for the captain and crew of the sub- '
marine. The Rev. Otto Apltz, Gei^
man immigrant missionary, conduotrd
the service. In his prayer he ask- ,
ed that the vessel and her crew may s
have a safe voyage home.
The servico was followed by a ban- \
nuet. The Neckar was brilliantly '
lighted.
The Deutschland was partially sub- |
mergeri ai nor slip, The water is not
deep enough for full submergence.
A series of events at the pier where ]
the Deutschland is berthed, indicated
that her departure would not he long
delayed. The most significant of
these were the tilling of her water
tanks and the stowing below her deck
of the crew's bedding as it was removed
from the Neckar nearby. Since
their arrival two weeks ago tlia
Deutschland's crew have been sleeping
aboard the Neckar.

The Germans have-been putting forward
their full stream in attempts
to prevent the British forces from
reaching their third line positions.
Fighting of the fiercest character is
in progress.
The fact that General Haig has been
able to resume the offensive so soon
after the unsuccessful German counter-attacks
of last week in which very
strong German forces wore brought
forward is regarded as a good
augury.
At Guillemont and Lotigueval fortunes

Ht such an Important change at this

j
General Trevino has personally directed
the campaign against bandits I

because of his efforts that the Carranza
soldiers have continued heir j
operations against Villa and other outlaw

General Herrera would use every re- j

Charlotte*?With tho southeastern
Hoods virtually over. North Carolina
citizens have turned to tho work of
relief and supplies of food and other
necessities are going into devastated
districts from half a dozen cities in
the state.
Representatives Pago and Webb, in
Washington, have culled the War Department's
attention to conditions in
the Yadkin Valley and Secretary
Baker has ordered a report from district
engineers with a view of asking
congress for authorization to extend
help to sufferers if federal action
should become necessary.
Conditions are described as serious
in Wilkes, Ashe and Watauga
counties, where many are said to bo
facing famine through inability to got
food supplies into the district hecause
of lack of transportation. In
Morth Wilkesboro a committee appointed
by the mayor lias sent out
appeals for help. All food supplies
are said to bo exhausted or greatly
curtailed and with roads and railways
washed away the transportation problem
is serious.
Flood victims in the AsheviUo district
are being provided with food
from that city, and wagons and
motortrucks are leaving other poiuts
with supplies. Rutht-rfordton has
sent wagon trains and pack horse*
over the mountains with food for Hf>0
persons in the Chimney Rock and
Bat Cave section. About 100 tourists
and summer vacationists are among
those penned up in the hills.
Two additional bodies have been
recovered from the Catawba river
near Belmont, leaving six of the 20
who went down with tho Southern
Railway bridge Sunday unaccounted
ror. it is nenevea now that tho
death list from the flood will he loss
than 100.
The armies o frepair men sent to
the flooded section are making rnpid
progress and prospects are that next
week normal schedules will he resumed
on the main lines of the railroads
affected. Various branch lines will be
out of commission much longer.
