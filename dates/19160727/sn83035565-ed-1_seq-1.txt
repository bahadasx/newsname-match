What is Said of Harry M.
Daugherty.
Columbus, 0., July 24-There
has been a very generous and
hearty disposition shown on the
part of many of the Republican
newspapers of Ohio in behalf of
the candidacy of Harry M. Dau
jjherty for the nomination as Uni
ted States Senator. This has
proven one of the potent and help
ful factors in the campaign which
he is making.
As a recognition of the assist
ance which these papers are'giv
ing and an appreciation on the
part of Mr. Daugherty as to their
help some of the expressions
printed in his behalf are given
below :
On July 13, the Gallipolis Week
ly Journal and the day Myron T.
Herrick was to appear there and
deliver an address, said in its ed
itorial columns:
"Hon.MyronT. Herrick will be
here this evening and deliver an
address. He is touring the state
in the interest of his candidacy
for the . Republican nomination
for United States Senator. He
is an able and worthy gentleman.
Many signal honors have been
won by him. He made a name
for himself and acquired great
wealth as a banker. As govern
nor of Ohio and T ambassador to
LlPxance he rendered hid state and
nation conspicuous and notewor
thy public service. He should be
tendered a cordial and hearty re
ception here. "
"Mr. Herrick, in our opinion,
might add greatly to his fame if,
in the course of his address this
evening he would say, 'I am deep
ly appreciative of the many great
honors that have been extended
to me by the Republicans of Ohio.
I have everything that money can
buy, and I have millions of mon
ey more than I can spend. I am
not going to ask for anything
more at your hands. Northern
Ohio Republicans should join
those of other parts of the state
and select a southern Ohio or cen
tral Ohio man for U- S. Senator.
Such a man is Harry M. Daugh
erty. His location is good, and
he has the ability and energy and
determination to make good in
the U.' S. Senate just as he has
made good everywhere that duty
has called him. While we rejoice
that the party is re-united for an
old-time victory in November,
let us not forget that Daugherty
saved the Republican party of
Ohio. He fought as no other par
ty leader in Ohio has fought to
preserve the organization, under
difficulties and discouragements
that were so overwhelming that
many of us became so disheart
ened that we didn't help him in
the hour ot his need. Ever since
' then and for a long time before
Daugherty had stood f earlessly
for what he thought was right
and battled unceasingly for Re
publican men and Republican
measures. But no substantia
honor has eve been conferred on
him by our party. However, it
is not too late. In August let us
lect for U. S. Senator the frank.
fearless, dashing and gallant Dau
gherty.' "
The Pomeroy Leader in its is
sue of July 13, after saying that
both Mr. Daugherty and Mr. Her
rick are men eminently fitted for
the office of United States Sena
tor, adds "There are reasons,
however, why we think the Re
publicans of Ohio should nomi
nate Harry M. Daugherty. Any
objection which a Republican
may have to Mr. Daugherty ap
plies with equal force to Mr. Her
rick. We admire Mr. Daugherty be
cause for more than 25 years he
has been loyally, faithfully, cour
ageously, uncomplainingly fight
ing in the ranks of the party.
His ability, his worthiness, his
unimpeachable character, his fi
delity to party principles and par
ty success entitle him to success.
As we gee it he should have the
high office he seeks unopposed.
But since he must contest for the
place the Republicans of Ohio
should rise to the righteousness
of their opportunity and see to
it that Harry M. Daugherty is
nominated by a decisive majority.
We like Harry M. Daugherty
for his warmth, his cordiality,
his approachableness. His gen
erous sympathy and gracious
manner make you feel at home
In his" presence; " If the plain pecn
pie of Ohio want to place the sen
atorial toga on one of their own
number they can do it by nomi
nating Harry M. Daugherty."
On the same date the Fostoria
Daily Review speaks of Mr. Dau
gherty in most kindly terms and
commends his candidacy. It say s :
"Ohioans this year will have
the opportunity of tending to the
United States Senate Harry M.
Daugherty of Columbus, one of
the most stalwart Republicans
of the state and a man who stood
firm for his convictions in 1912
when as State Chairman he
fought the hardest fight in the
party's history to save the Re
publicans from running third and
Dulled the G. 0. P. through with
flying colors.
"To know" Mr. Daugherty is to
love him ; he is the same today,
yesterday and for years to come.
He is a student of human nature
and always insists on looking a
man in the eye and having the
same done with him.
"Kind, charitable to a degree.
always ready, willing and anx
ious to do a good turn for one in
need, is the enviable reputation
of Mr. Daugherty. His many
acts towards friends stand as
monuments to him over the en?
tire statejof Ohio.v
"The Review is more than
pleased to endorse Mr. Daugher
ty's candidacy for the United
States Senate on the Republican
ticket."

The little son of 0. B. Kara

We are very glad to see so ma
ny of the young people at the
Christian Endeavor services each
Sunday evening, but it seems to
us that it would be very appro
priate, as well as encouraging to
the young people, if more of the
older folks would attend, espec
ially members of the church.
When some people begin to be
somewhat advanced in age they
apparently think that the En
deavor is only for the young.
We grant that it is essentially a
young people's service, but it is
a service for training, and the
young should have the support
and ' presence of older workers
for guidance and advice. There
fore we think it would be better
for them to be present and assist
in any way they can.

Cockroaches; Ancient
and Modern.
"The -cockroach" is the .most
widespread .of 5 r. sects."- both j, in
I oint of time and of space,' de
clared Wencel J. Kostir of the
department of . zoology of the
Ohio State University, in his talk
before the Biology Club last week.
'Their fossils," lje continued,
'have been found in t layers of
rock that were exposed as sur
face long before the age of man.
They antedate even the amphibi
ans and early reptiles."
The term cockroach was de
rived from the Spanish word cu
caracha, according to Mr. Kostir.
The name blackbettle commonly
applied to the insect is errone
ous. ,
''Cockroaches," he said, "are
of all colors, those seen around
dwellings being brown. The
pure white are uncommon, and
the bright colored ones are found
usually in the tropics. Some
species attain a length of two and
a half to three inches. It was
formerly the habit of the people
df Germany to revile each other
by speaking of the insect in the
name applied to a certain section
of Germany. For example, the
people in the southern part called
the cockroach Prussian, etc.
"The eye of the insect is made
up of 1,800 little eyes placed side
by side, each having its own
nerve center. The character of
the sight, it is thought, is of
mosaic nature, and not at all like
that of human beings.
"The cockroach is very fond of
starch, and for this reason often
eats its way into books for the
starch under the binding."

campaign tiuunsh his civil service ap
pointtes against niyself or uny other
Democrat who objects to his six-year
record. The older l-mocrals know toy
faithful, active and lor.g service to Demo
cratic principles and candidates, but
many young men are deceived. "I'pon
what meat liotli this our Caesar feed that
he is grown so great" that no one of our
650, 000 Democrats can be a candidate
without his cctisentV
The Democrats of Ohio owe It to Presi
dent Wilson to resent Pomerene's un
warranted claims, because everybody re
members how the Republicans of New
York jresenied I'resioent Arthur's dictat
ing the nomination of Judge J-'olger for
governor, and how it resulted in the
election of (Irover Cleveland by a ma
jority of 1MI..00U. and luter gi-ve Cleve
land the electoral vote ot New York and
made him President of the United States.
1 deny that President Wilson authorized
any one at the Democratic state conven
tion or elsewhere to say that he desires
Potr.ei ene's nomination, because tht
spring primary shows that Pomerene
wouid be a handicap to every county,
congress. onal, state and national candi
date in t ' i' November races.
The DemociHi-y of Ohio brands Pom
erene's claim of being a piesidental pet
or a hyphenated "Wilson-Pomerene" can
didate as cheaii and beggarly and beneath
the acuity of a l.'niied States Senator.
I,et the people of Ohio rule In Ohio ia
good Democracy. W hy didn't Atlee Pom
erene give tlie people of Ohio more de
mocracy by erablins tliem to elect their
postmasters as well as their senators?
fcei.alms arid congressmen ought to go
to Washington to legislate on national
and inlei national questions and not to
pat eel out Burden seed, hoise books and
postofflccs as political graft and spoils.
Atice Pomerene begs six years more of
Democratic i'avnr i !i tlie ground 1 1 1 u t he
has been winking over tims helping Wil
son. What UepublUan in the seimie and
what Democrat has been less laitnlui to
the President in his policy of American
Ism? The vital question is whether Atles
Pomi-tene has been a Demociatic repre
sentative of the people of Ohio and not
whether he has been a pre.sidental cuckoo.
Democrats and Republicans are agreed
on. Americanism. it was proclaimed
by Jefferson in the Declaration of In
dependence; il was written in letters
of blood from Dexingtnn to Vorktown; it
was shot into British redcoats by Andrew
Jackson til New Orleans; it was estab
lished in the Alonioe Doctrine in 18-io; it
carried the siars and striues into Mexico
in 184ii; il imaniitaii.ed Lincoln in a war
that liheinted our slaves and it glorified
our Keuut.lic in a war that liberated
Cuba. I favor an Americanism that will
be as characteristic as the ilonroe Doc
trine, and still more positive in estab
lishing freedom of the high seas for
ail neutral nathms, and enforcing
equal and exact neutrality toward all
foreign nations er.gaped in the Kuropeun
war, a neutrality that shall be equally
exacting in protecting American citizens,
American commerce and Ai.-iftrican mails.
I favor that Americanism which refuses
to be a party to any foreign alliance or
entanglement ami 1 refuse to be a party
to an domestic alliance or entanglement
with that invisible government which lies
back of political machines and bosses.
Sly candidacy is suppoiied by a record
of ii years gratuitous ciimpuiKn services
in almosl every county of our stale and in
many states east and west from Maine to
Oregon; from the election of Ceorge
Tloadley and Urover Clevi-land In 1883 and
1884 down through my two terms in Con
gress and up to and Including my approval
and endorsement of the Democratic plat
form, nominees and speeches of Governor
Glynn, Ollie James and William Jen
nings Bryau at the St. l.uuis con
vention. I have supported Tariff Re
form, Currency rtei'orm, Income Tax,
Klection cf L'nited States Senators by
direct vote of .the people, Postal Savings,
Parcel Post, Free Kural Delivery and
other reforms tiiat must be secured before
tlie people come into their own.
1 invite comparison of n;y Democracy
with that of Pomerene. Was he support
ing Democratic principles when he voted
against the lii-nii.i-r.Us in favor of seating
Stevenson, tlie Hi publican multi-millionaire
coriu;ilii.ist of Wisconsin, who
bought a seat at a price of $107,000?
Stevenson need.d an alleged Democrat to
make a speech for him and he found one
in Pomerene.
Was Pomerene supporting Democratic
principles when lie repudiated the pint
form of the Dayton Demociatic state con
vention endorsing the Sherwood pension
bill? Was he supporting Democratic
principles when he spoke against the
Sherwood pension bill and defeated it in
the Senate, thereby antagonizing the old
soldiers, their sons and grandsons and at
the same time exhibited a petty envy and
Jealousy of General Sherwood's great na
tional career as a soldier and statesman,
and at once demonstrated Pomerene'8
real brand of Americanism, which repudi
ates the soldiers that saved the Union?
Was he supporting Democratic principles
when he spoke anil voted against the
Webb-Kenyon bill declaring it unconsti
tutional, unfair and unjust, or when he
voted to support Republican President
Taft's veto of tlie law'.' Didn't he demons
trate that his Judgment against the
Webb-Kenyon law was legally, morally
and politically unsound, as many courts
have since decided? Was he supporting
Democratic principles in his six years
failure to introduce a bill for presidential
primaries and a bill fo rthe election ot
postmasters by the people.
Is he'supportiTig Democratic principles
when he undertakes to subordinate the
Democrats of Ohio to a political machine
und goes so low in his campaign methods
as to claim that President Wilson i- but
cog in this Ohio political machine?
Doesn't he confess in this his first ap
pearance before a popular primary that
be is afraid of his record, realizing that
Ids only chance to be nominated is by
slipping in unde- the rout-tails of Wood
row Wilson? I egree with the Democ
racy of Ohio that much at Atlee Pom
erene'ft lone term has been wasti.il In
leaving undone those things which he
i ought to have done, and in doing thosa
things which he ought not to have done.
I Hence, I submit my name at the Slh of
I August primary, that a dissatisfied and
I disappointed Democracy may express
their disapproval of Pomerene's record
and give me an opportunity to make an
other Democratic record at Washington.
Yours faithfully, ,
