Blooded Animal From Other
State to Be Brought Here
For Exhibition.
Secretary Weatherly, of the
Chamber of Commerce of Columbub
and Lowndes county, is making
elaborate plans for the animal indus
try exhibition which is to he held
hcif 5n October and sta- that he
hopcj to make it one of ine most pre
tentious exhibits of a similar nature
ever witnessed in Mississippi.
Stock raising has made rapid
progress in the territory contiguous
to Columbus' during the past few
years, and it is now generally recog
nized as one of our most important
bucolic industries. Many farmers in
this vicinity are raising horses,
mules, cows, hogs and sheep both
for breeding and for slaughter, and
the coming exhibition will afford to
them their first opportunity to show
the public justjwhat they are doing
along this line. An unique feature
of the exhibition will be daily par
ades, all the fine cattle brought here
being led through the principal
streets so that they can be seen and
admired not only by stockmen but
by citizens of Columbus as well. Val
uable prizes will be offered and ex
perts will be brought here from dif
ferent agricultural colleges in this
and other states to judge the cattle.
Secretary Weatherly is planning
to attend the annual meeting of the
Southern Cattlemen's Association,
.which convene In Shpvr, T,,
and while there will come in contact
with prominent cattle and stock
raisers from all portions of the
south. He will endeavor to pur-
suade some of these gentlemen who
own unusually fine stock to send an
imals here tot the show next fall,
and this will give to the exhibition
an interstate interest.
Dates for the exhibition have not
yet been fixed, but it will be held
oaie time during the latter part of
October, and will be in progress
three days.
VIOLENT ATTACKS OCCUR ON
FRONT ON S
CALM PREVAILS ON FRENCH
FRONT RUSSIANS CONTINUE
TO PRESS AUSTR1ANS.
London, July 26. Fierce fighting
is still going on between the British !
and Germans In the Somme region
of France, the men in their endeav
ors to press forward or to hold back
attacks frequently engaging in hand-to-hand
combats.
The British are tenaciously hold
ing to the portions of the village of
Pozieres from which they drove the
Germans, and with their artillery fire
have repulsed there an attempt by
German infantry to regain possession
of the northwestern portion of the
village.
Calm Jias prevailed on the French
section of the front in the Somme
region. In fact, except for a bom
bardment of Laufee, to the north
west of Verdun, the French war of
fice says there has been no impor
tant action on the entire French
front.
The Russians continue to make
progress against the Teutonic allies
in the Volhyrtia district, sending
their troops across the Saloneveke
' river notwithstanding the fire of the
Teutons. One thousand prisoners
and four cannon and five machine
guns were taken in this region by
the Russians.
Berlin admits the penetration by
the Russians of part of Gen. Von
Linsingen's first line of trenches" in
Volhynia.
In the Carpathian district the
Austrians at several points attacked
the Russian' cavalry, but Petrograd

AT PARK TO LISTEN TO
FAMOUS AUTHOR.
"OLD RKLIAHLIT
GREETS FRIENDS
Vocal Selection by Mr. Bailey
Hardy Add to Charm of the
Occasion.
Judge Harris Diekson, of Vicks
burg, who is delivering a series of
lectures in various towns and cities
throughout the state for the benefit
of the First Regiment, Mississippi
National Guard, spoke in the pavil
lion at Lake Park Tuesday night and
was greeted by a large and fashion
able audience.
Rev. W. S. Slack, rector of St.
Paul's Episcopal church, officiated
as master of ceremonies, and inaug
urated the program by introducing
Mrs. Bailey Hardy, who render a
song cycle consisting of three num
bers, one of them having been given
as an encore to applause which was
so generous as to necessitate a re
sponse. All three selections were
plantation, melodies which fitted ad
mirably the spirit of the occasion
and were rendered with exquisite
technique. Miss Annie Neilson- ap
peared as Mrs. Hardy's skilled ac
companist.
Mr. Slack then introduced Judge
Dickson, who for more than an hour
kept his audience highly entertained.
The dissertation was a coloquial
pot pourri rather than a lecture hav
ing run the gamut from historical
data to negro dialect stories, and
through its entire course the speaker
kept his hearers not only interested
but delighted and charmed. He be
gan by making an eloquent pr?n flsV
preparedness, for a large standing
army, which he showed conclusively
was necessary to the safety of the
country; then told of need of funds
to care for sick soldiers, and wound
up by telling a series of negro dia
lect stories with "Old Reliable" as
the central figure. These stories
were received with enthusiasm, and
those in the audience demonstrated
their appreciation of the humorist'R
?fforts by frequent outbreaks of
laughter and applause.
Judge Dickson has probably at
tained greater fame as an author
than any other Mississippian of the
present generation, his "Old Relia
ble" stories having appeared in some
of the best known magazines in the
country and having been widely read
both North and South. Judge Dick-
sonnas been classed with the late
Joel Chandler Harris, of Georgia, as
a delineator of the negro character
and dialect, but he k, nevertheless,
a creator rather than an imitator,
for while the gifted Georgian de
picted the negro of the ante-bellum
period Judge Dickson shows him to
us as he is today, "Old Reliable" be
ing a lazy, shiftless vagabond who
lives largely by his wits and whose
most arduous tasks are the mixing
of mint juleps and cocktails, at
which he is an artist of no mean
ability. Notwithstanding his numer
ous shortcomings, however, "Old
Relibale" is both good natured and
witty, and his quaint humor and un
failing deference to "quality white
folks" serve to make him an ex
ceedingly interesting character.
The tour of Judge Dickson is be
ing sponsored by the Grand Lodge
of Mississippi, B. P. 0. E., and he
appeared here under the auspices of
the local lodge.

Now that the rains have disap

in increased numbers and local
farmers are dividing their time be
tween repairing damage resulting
from the recent storm and a strenu
ous efforts to rid their fields of the
pestiferous insects.
For several . days succeeding the
storm few weevils were seen, and
some farmers thought that they had
been drowned out by the rain. Those

know that the insects thrive in wet

the Senate, including 'four dread
naughts and four battle cruisers to

Efforts of the federal health ser
vice to prevent, if possible, the
spreading of infantile paralysis to
cities and towns outside of New
York, have been strengthened by an
order issued Tuesday that no child

ted to leave New York without a
certificate from the federal sur
geons. All railroads leaving the city
are co-operating with the authori
ties and no tickets are sold unless

Rivert Arc Now in Bank.
After having been on a rampage
for nearly two weeks as the result
of reovnt floods, the Tombigbee and
Luxapapila rivers both of which flow
near Columbus, are again within
their banks, and traffic, which to a
large extent had been impeded by
the high waters, has been resumed.
A number of important manufac
turing enterprises are located in the
territory which was inundated, and
these were necessarily compelled to
suspend operation while their plants
were surrounded by water, now that
this water has receded, however, the
mills and factories are preparing to
resume operation and most of them
are expectd to be running on full
time within ftie next few days.

scene. He says that the car turned
completely over into a deep uncn
with about three feet or water in it.
Miss File's head was under the water
with her feet out, and Watson win
under the water.
Uefore they could get them rrom
under the car it was necessury
to
stnd to Mr. Fowler's country home
for some mules to get Uie heavy car
;off. When the two bodies were re
covered from the wreck Dr. K. M.
Boyd, the first physician on the
scene, made a careful examination
and said that no bones were broken.
Miss Fite received a hard blow on
the face which might have caused
her death.

Injunction Aiked for by Pro
hibitionist Hat Not Deen
Granted.
While press dispatches sent out
from Jackson during the past week
indicate that the law limiting ship
ments of vinous, spiritous and malt
liquors to points within the borders
of the state has been suspended
pending a vote by the people on the
subject at the regular election in
November, local express official
have received no instructions re
garding a change, and the law is be
ing rigidly enforced here.
A petition was recently filed with
Secretary of State Tower asking for
a referendum vote on the question,
and prohibition leaders, after hav
ing carefully examined the petition
and ascertained that it carried the
requisite number of signatures,
sought to obtain an injunction re
straining Secretary Power from is
suing an order suspending the en
forcement of the statute. The law
provides, however, that with the fil
ing of such a petition the law auto
matically becomes inoperative, and
the prayer for injunction, according
to information received here, wa
not granted.
If the law has served to decrea.se
the sule of liquor in other cities and
ti wus throughout the state as it his
in Columbus it has undoubtedly had
a most salutary effect, as violation
