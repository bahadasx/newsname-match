just cause to feel proud of such a
y company of men. Not only are
d they as fine a lot of soldiers as there Edi
,e are to be found, but their behavior the
n and their attitude towards their will
). superior officers could not be im- Thi
e proved upon." Lieutenant Love on

is eleven men. This was more than I
of he could get in a whole week spent is I
of at New Orleans, but it is no more acd
