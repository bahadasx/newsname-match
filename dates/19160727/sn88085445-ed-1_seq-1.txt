TELLS WHAT COWS NEED
"The A airy cow must have g'efn
forage or other succulence at all
times If she Is to bold up la her
luftk production." ueclartjß Prof. A.
B Kystrom of Pullman in a State
College bulletin this week. "It is
not uncommon for many cows 10
drop in their milk flow during hot,
dry weather, but this can be pre
vented by providing something to
take the place of pact", re.
"The silo is the best means for
fontlahiafl this succulence. Ex
cellent silage can be made frou
coin, wtett, oats, and barley, or
clever, peas and veich, or, in fa- t
any combination of these, j By put
ting, these crops in the silo at
siage-s ranging froa l the nipk stage
in the ctse of small cereals to tbe
d« nted stage in tbe case of corn,
ti.e largest urimunt of nutrients csn
be saved and tbe crop can be har
vested with tbe least amount of la-'
ber. In o.her words, the silo stvc-e
Loth feed and labor.
"Wheat no silo i.. available ,hese
roas shouhi be cut green and fed
■> cows in racks or in the stable
. aLgers. Such a practice is eallod
■soiling. This l—flllill is not as -co
aoaiioal as the silo method bin
rather than have no succulence Soi'-
inr Bbould by all means be prac
ticed.
"It should be remembered that
the cow producing a large amount

KAFFIR CONCERT TO
CLOSE CHAUTAUQUA
With a concert by tbe Kaffir Boy
Choir, one of the main attraction*
of the week, Lynden'B Chautauqua
will close this evening. For aeveu
days, the bulging brown tent has
given tbe people of tbe district the
best series of lectures, concerts and
other features that this city has
known, with the result that it is
new practically assured that Lyn
den will be on the Chaatauqua map
again in 1917.
By noon on Friday, opening day
of the Chautauqua, the local com
mittee had disposed of the fifteen
hundred dollars worth of tickets re
quired by their contract, and be
fore the day was over and all tbe
returns wore- in, the total had
mounted to $1,700. The price of
the season tickets waa prompt ly
advanced to $3.00.
The Lynden record is especially
pleasing when compared with the
showing made at Bellingham, where
on opening day the guarantors
found thenirjelves $500 short of the
required amount.
The largest crowds or tte week
were present Monday, Band Day,
and Tuesday evening, when the
wonderful moving pictures of Sir
Doughs Mawson's Antarctic expe
dition wtara shown. About vine
hundred people made tip tbe record
audience. That the Chautauqua
had drawn people to Lynden from
a wide area was illustrated Monday
evening, when a report from the
at.dionce showed visitors from all
sections of the county, and from
p< ints as far E-'.st as New York
City.
A contract for next year similar
to the one in force this season has
been drawn up, and was signed by
sixty ci'izens Monday evening. Sev
eral others bave signed since ftiat
time. The contract is at tbe Lyn
den State Bank.
Before turning the contract over
tit the Ellison-White Company, ibe
1917 Chautauqua and tbe contract
will be discussed at a meeting of
guarantors Friday morning at 10
o'clock at tue City Hall.
Lynden'a first experience with
Chautauqua was lnatie tbe more
pleasant by the excellent staff that
has represented the Ellison-White
Company in this city. Mas Ora
Harkness as advance agent and Dr.
Robert Sutcliffe, superintendent,
did everything iv their power to
make the week & thorough success
fiom all standpoints, and the wiau
has been expressed generally that
'bey might return next year. Dr.
Sutcliffe's addresses, tucked i-wuy
on the morning programs, proved a
■irlendid feature, overshadowing in
■-I feet some of the more widely her
alded lectures of the afternoon and
eiening.
C. S. Sweeny, who ia now living
a- Southhaven, Mich., sends his
g'eetings to all his Lynden friends
to a letter received at The Tribune
office this week. "Remember me
to Mr. Hawley, likewise to Aunt
Raebe] Smith and H. H. Jamieson
3Ld all enquiring friends," writes
Mr. Sweezy. "1 am almost 81 years
old now. I am able to work in \he
gtrden and ride In the auto. I
want you to continue the paper. I
love it. 1 lived in Lynden 10 years
