tained by Stanford University in the
Lane Hosiptal, Where Suspect Was
Receiving Treatment "Not for a
Wound," Police Said—Officers Be
lieve They Have Man Who Placed
Suitcase on Sidewalk and Are Hot
on Trail of His Accomplice.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 26—The
first 'imDortant" arrest in the hunt
for the plotters who exploded a bomb
during the San Francisco preparedness
parade last Saturday, killing eight and
injuring 40 persons, was made today
when Chief of Police White and a
squad of detectives arrested W.' K.
Hillings, an automobile machinist, and
held him incommunicado. The arrest
was staged dramatically in the free
clinic maintained by Stanford universi
ty in the Lane hospital, where tha
suspect was receiving treatment "not
for a wound," the. police said.
Immediately after the arrest the po
lice announced they had made an im
portant capture which they expected
vould lead to further arrests of per
sons connected with the bomb outrage,
but further than that no details were
forthcoming. The hospital authorities,
likewise, refused any information. Re
ports that the suspect had "confessed"
could not be confirmed through police
channels. Hillings' history and move
ments tile police also screened with
tiecreey.
Hillings' arrest came only a few
hours after Chief White had declared
that they all but had their hands on
tha man who actually planted the suit
case bomb on the sidewalk where it
exploded during the parade and that
they also were hoi on the trail of hie
accomplices whoso names the chief
said were known to him.
When Hillings was safely behind the
liars the bomb bureau men and Chief
White were openly claled.
Another development that the police
considered highly important in their
search was the discovery pf a bomb
shell, a implicate of which Newton
(!. Potter, manager of a bracing and
welding company hero told Captain
Duncan Mathesan, head of the bond)
bureau, lie made for two men who sub-1
in'tt-'d a cample to him t v-> months
ago. The shell, ten ini lies long, and
about eight inches in diameter, was
made of a piece of pipe with both ends
capped and a holo drilled in one cap.
The men for whom Potter made the
instrument did not explain for what
purpose they wanted it, but told Pot
er that if the job wos satisfactory they
would contract for more. They never
returned for their sample, which the
police believe is the repiico of the
one that killed and maimed so many
people Saturday. Potter furnished de
scriptions of the men.
Just what clue led the detectives
to the Stanford clinic today liief
White would not say, but in his state
ment previous to the arrest he said
highly important information had
come from citizens. It was expected
tonight that other arress would be
made shortly.
The eighth victim of the bomb, Mrs.
Kinsley VanLoo of Fresno, died today.
Chief of Police White announced to
night that lie had enough evidence to
ask for the indictment of W. K. Bill
ings. He said Billings' movements had
been traced to within a few minutes
of tlie explosion. White's statement
regarding the evidence connecting Bill
ings witli the explosion was corrobo
rated by District Attorney Charles M.
Fickert.
White said further that at least five
other men, whose nameR he would not
divulge, were implicated in the plot;
that the police knew where some of
these men were and would have all of
them in custody in a short time.

PATROL OFF CAPE HENRY
WASHINGTON, July 26.—Aroused
by an official report from the com
mander of the battleship Louisiana
that a mysterious all ip purporting to
be a British cruiser, had passed into
the mouth of Chesapeake Bay early
yesterday morning, the navy depart
ment today ordered the armored cruis
er North Carolina and three destroy
ers to neutrality duty off Caiic Henry.
Officials maintained unusual se
crecy regarding the matter and would
not disclose just what instructions
were sent to the commander of the
North Carolina. It was assumed, how
ever, that he had been directed to see
that the German merchant submarine
Deutschland, now' preparing for her re
turn trip to Germany, is not attacked
by allied war vessels within the three
mile limit and that American neutral
ity is not otherwise violated.
Unofficially navy officers agreed that
if the ship sighted from the Louisiana
was a British cruiser, the commander
of the vessel had been guilty o»' a
breach of naval practice and bad vio
lated navigation laws in cruising with
in American territorial waters with
out proper lights. While it was con
ceded that the cruiser was within her
rights in entering territorial waters,
provided she had observed the rules,
it was declared an attempt to run into
MILWAUKEE ENGINEER BURNED
ABOUT LEGS WHILE FIREMAN

HOW THE AUNT OCCURRED
Engineer Frank Fackel and Fire
man L. A. Rogers, employes of the
Milwaukee, were buried under the
wreckage of a "K" engine which was
derailed about a half mile west of
Danvers late Monday niglit. Fackel's
limbs are badly burned from bis waist
down and lie i s being eared for at
St. Joseph's hospital. While very
painful his injuries arc not considered
to he at all dangerous. Rogers es
caped almost without a scratch.
Tlio train they were operating was
a gravel extra in charge of Conductor
McDonnell. Engineer Fackel was
backing when, from some unknown
cause, tlie engine left tlie track, ten
der first, and swayed over on its side,
five cars piling up on top of it. Tlie
enginomen were buried underneath.
Rogers managed to extricate himself
almost Immediately; Fackel was pin
ioned, however, and was too close U
tlie fire box for comfort. It was
fortunate circumstance that tlie water
in the tank broke hrough and flo veil
down over his body just in time to
prevent bis burns from being mud
more serious than they are.
The rest of tlie train crew, who
rushed immediately to the wreekt"
engine, rescued Fackel first withm
noticing that Rogers had freed him
self without assistance. They liega
searching for him under the vrecl
age, and he, thinking they were stil 1
hunting l'or Fackel, lent his aid. I
wa a a hit amusing when they all found
their bearings and made tlie discovery
that Rogers bad been helping to hum
for himself. The injured men were
cared for by Dr. F. F. Attix, tlie con:
pally surgeon.
Tha damaged engine was taken to
Deer Lodge yesterday for repairs..

GOOD DAY'S RECORD
Erzingan, in Armenia. Is Lost to the
Turks, While the Germans and Aus
trians on the Eastern Front Appear
Unable to Make a Successful Stand
Anywhere Against the Victorious
Russian Forces—Russians Now Arc
Within 12 Miles of Brody, Which
Guards the Approaches to Lemberg,
and Places Bothmer in Danger.
_ LONDON, July 26.-—(10:40 p. m.) —
The allies lire able to congratulate
themselves on another good day's rec
ord with tlie capture of the important
positions of Poz'eres. nil the western
front, and Erzingan. in Armenia, while
the Russian general. Sakharoff. in the
lighting on the Slonevka river, cap
tured another 4,000 prisoners and five
guns.
Tlie British secretary for War, David
Lloyd George, in a published state
ment tonight, shows the Importance
the Germans attached to tlie roten
t on of Pozieres by quoting from a
German divisional order Issued on July
II, as follows:
"Furthermore, the conversion of
villages into strong points Is of the
greatest importance. Such villages are
Pozieres, Contalinaison and tlie two,
Benzatln and Longueval."
Secretary Lloyd George points out
that with the capture of Pozieres the
last of these villages lias fallen into
tlie allies' hands. Further, he points
out that today's German claim of the
repulse of an attack on Trones wood
must be n clerical error, as Tron-s
wood Inis been in British possession
since July 14.
Tlie opinion of military critics in
London is that no positions as strong
i.s those the British now are success
fully attacking will he found tietw son
Pozieres and Bapaume; otherwise,
they argue, the Germans would not
have risked bringing troop R and guns
from the Verdun sector to defend I'o
zleres and It is inferred from indica
tions in the official dispatches that
tlie British are already beginning to
establish themselves on both slde R of
tlie road from Pozieres to Bapaume.
As on tlie western front, the Ger
mans and Austrians appear unable to
make a successful stand anywhere
against the victorious Russian forces.
General Sakhnroff's recent success
has brought him within about 12 miles
of Brody, which guard R the approaches
to Lemberg, and places von Bothmer's
army in danger.
The unexpectedly swift fall of Er
zingan leads to the supposition hero
that tin 1 Turks must have removed the
guns from file defensese of this town
to assist tlie armies in the field, not
anticipating such a rapid Russian ad
vance in such a difficult country.
The Italian front attracts little pub
lic interest, but the Italians have re
cently boon making good progress in
Hie Dolomites region.
