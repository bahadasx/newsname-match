(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 26. Pres
ident Wilson and state depart
ment officials practically have
completed preparation of a pro- ,
tes aqainst the promulaation of
a blacklist of America nfirms un
der the British tradino with the
enemy act. It was said today t'n?
the communication would b- sent
to London .in the near future,
probably within the next few n'avs. .
It will discuss the principles In
volved and will not interfere with the
continuance of informal discussions
between representatives of the two
governments over the cses of indi-vid'i-1
firms inclndd in the blacklist.
State department officials be
lieve that their study of the black'
list clearly has proved that It
' iniures American firms In viola
t:on of international law. Acting
Reer-tarv Polk talked jver with
Pr-sie-t Wilsnn tnay facts laid
before him by the firms affect,
ard the precedents on whirh. the
Henartmnt will act. It is saH that
issue will be taken with France,
Resia and Italv.
It is understood here that In an-
nnuneinE its blacklist Crest Britain i
reallv arted in deference to her al-
lieg. ho felt that their own merchants
were suffering and come British mer
chants were profiting through the
failure of the London government to
follow the lead of the continent
powers in making indiscriminate war
unon all of their enemies, commercial
as we'l as th"5e resident in Germany
and Austria-Hungary.
The allies view of the legal as
pects of the blacklist order which
nrobablv will be the basis of the par
liamentary statement to be issued
soon in London and be Incorporated
in the reply to the American pro
test, it is understood, to be as fol
lows :
Prejudiced Viewpoint
The allies agree to enforce inter
national law aeainst their enemies
and upon all their subjects without
distinction. The continental rule ap
plied by Germany, France, Italy and
Russia, interprets th eword "enemy"
as a person of ?nemy origin or Inter
est. Fnelish and American precedents
put the emphasis on domicile. Con
senuently British subjects have con
sidered they could trade with any
enemy firm domiciled in a neutral
country.
The rule to nrohibit trading with
the enemv. either directly or indi
rectly end the ri.;ht of a sovereign
forernnient to nrohibit its subjects
from !rdi5 with anyone, friend or
foe. was maintained bv the United
States. Great Britain is ready to point

IRISH REVOLT
THREATENS AGAIN
LONDON. July 26. An excit-
ine scene, indicative of the
strong feeling which prevails
among the Irish members, occur-
red in the House of Commons
tonight when Timothy Healy
charged the h'jvernment with ar-
resting 2.000 innocent persons in
j the course of the Irish rebellion
I and treated them with a cruelty
I and ferositv which even Germans
! had not shown in Belgium. The
home secretary, headed by his
administration had started the
Sinn Feinn organization in Ire-
land and . therefore was for the
movement.
The speaker here was called
hotly to order for irrevelance
but did not refuse the request of
Herbert L. Samuel, the. home
secretary, ljr permission to re-
ply to the charges made by Hea-
ly. Secretary Samuel charac-
terized Healy's charges as utter-
ly unfounded and denied vigor-
ously that prisoners had been ill
treated or placed in solitary con-
finement. as alleged.
Special Board to
Try Militiamen
Who Crossed Line
That no more militiamen or
other soldiers may get into
trouble in the future by crossing;
the Mexican boundary line, in
tentionallv or otherwise. Col.
Robert H. Nobles is understood
to have issued an order that no
officer or enlisted man shall go
south of El Paso and Southwest
ern tracks, which ru nabout paral
lel to and one-half mile north of
the border from Douglas into
Naco.
A special board of five officers,
it is understood, has been ap
pointed to try "the six members
of the ambulance corps who were
captured by a Carranzista patrol
in Mexico last Sunday morning.
It is not thought that the sen
tence will be sevede. The maxi
mum for the offense could be im
prisonment for six months and
a fine equal to two-thirds of the
amount of money drawn for that
period.
Col. Noble has. as yet. not an
nounced the board which will rry

Abominable Act
Unofficially, navy officers al
leged the belief that i" the cruis
er the Louisiana saw was a Brit
ish vessel, the commander .'iad
been guilty of a breach of naval
practice and had violated naviga
tion laws In cruising within Am
erican territorial waters without
proper lights. While it was con
ceded the cruiser was within her
rights in tenterlng territorial
waters, provided she had observ
ed the rules, it was declared an
attempt to run into the bay on a
scouting expedition and in disre
gard of navigation laws, would
constitute a gross violation of
neutrality laws. The name of the
craft is not known and since she
apparently returned to sea after a
brief inspection of the roadstead
only, the principle involved in the
incident can be treated in what-'
ever course the Washington gov
ernment nicy- nursiKv A violation
of navigation laws cannot be held
against an unidentified ship.
The signals while in neutral waters
are two white lights hoisted on the
main mast which are the recognized
signal of a warship at night the world
over. Navigation laws require how
ever, that red and green port and star
board lights must be displayed by all
vessels in motion so that other craft
may determine their course and avoid
accidents. The report indicates that I
the cruiser did not obey that rule,

the subject of complaint to the Brit

clearly indicated tonight, however,
that adequate precautions would be
taken by naval vessels on neutrality
duty to see t.hat the visit was not re
peated unless the proper formalities
and that British and French war ves
sels which might be lying off the

diant submarine to pass out on her

Violates All Forms
The statement that the mysterious !
visitor in the roads last night made
the s'gn "Knglisli cruiser" puzzled
navy officers. The ordinary style of
reporting t.'ie identity of a warship
to a passing vessel or marine lookout
would require a formal statement of
nationality and name. The Louisiana
would report herself as the "V. S. S.
Louisiana" and a British warship or
dinarily would say "H. M. S.55 (His
