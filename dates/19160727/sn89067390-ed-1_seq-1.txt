THE PRIMARY
August I.
It is highly important that every Republican in Taney
county should go to the polls and vote on Primary Day,
August 1, no matter whom he may favcr fcr nomination.
Every man who intends to vote for Hughes and
Fairbanks is entitled to help nominate the Republican
ticket at the primary election. Indeed, it's his duty to
help.
Let's prove n Primary Day that the Republican
party is the biggest party in Missouri. To do that, we'll
all have to vote. The Democrats always do.
And while we are at it, why not vote for a great busi
ness man, Walter S. Dickey, for United States Senator.
His nomination will guarantee success.
It is also tight in demanding a full vited to attend Thursday night July

Wilson's Scholastic Shackles
"A th twig is b:nt, si is th? trie
inclined." Tais is a f'tnd-.mental
proposition in edcation. Wj see its
operation in every day life on all sides
We see it in the record of W.iodnw
Wilson in the White Hnfe.
Until recently Mr. Wilson was a ped
agogue. The formative period ol b'u
life was spent midst the archives of
educational institutions. He spent
his prime days as a scholastic, formulat
ing theories, announcing theories,
teaching theories; and he did it well.
However, with such a background a
man is badly handicapped when called
upon (or the power and will to decide
quickly aid to act vigorously, as is
ever.the call cpon one occupying an
important administrative office. The
executive officer of industry, the exec
utive officer of government, must
be essentially a motor-minded man.
His energies must be readilly transfer
able to channels of quick decisive
action.
Woodrow Wilson's energies are readi
ly transferable into lofty rnusiegs and
petty theories. His motor-side runs
to words, not deeds. Essentially an
Intellectualist and a scholastic, hf is
detached from the world of men and
things and deeds. This explains his
lack of capacity in dealing with the
great administrative problems which
have confronted him.
The country needs a leader; not
alone a leader in thought and word,
but one who can take the helm in his
hands and steer the ship.
What Wilson lacks Hughes possess
es. The Republicad candidate's whole
background is one of vigorous activity
midst men and things. Realizing this,
the people called for his nomination.
Now they are calling for his election.
The Senate Navy Bi'l
It will require all the pressure the
White House can bring to bear to in
duce the House to accept the iocreai
es in the naval appropration bill made
by the Senate. Judging from the ante
cedents of senators, deference to the
wishes of the president wis responsible
far the practical unanimity of thae Dmo
cratic seniors. There were only two
who voted against trnbill on finl pass
age although severa lsupported proposed
ammendments to reduce the program
and lengthen the building ti ns. Sx
Republicans opposed the bill to the
end. Th:re hivj alwiys been enough
little navy Republicans in the House
and S mite, when added to the large
number of little navy Democrats, to
prevent our navy from taking its proper
nnk. It will be somewhat embarras
ing br the House Democrats, who 'on
June 2 by a vote of 189 to 193 defeat
ed the Rpu'ilican proposal to add two
battleships, two scout cru'sers and ten
destroyers, to accept the S:mte ad d
ition of ten battleships, six scout
cruisers, forty destnyen, nine .fhet
submarines, eight coast submarines, a
Nefl submarine, two fuel ships, an
ammunition ship, a repair sh;p, a
transport, two destroyer tenders, a sub
marine tender and two gunbaits
There are also increases in personnel
and appropriations fcr other purposes
deemed essential by the General Navy
Board.
The lessons taught by the North
Sea naval battle will afford some excuse
to the majority of the House Com
mittee on Naval Affairs for a chenge
of views as to the needs of our navy.
The absolute necessity for dread
naughts in caseof actual battle, was
demonstrated by that engagement.
It is true that our coast line is so
long that we need battle cruisers and
a fleet is blind without scout cruisers.
But the posibility of actual naval
battles must be kept in mind. It
would profit us little to be able to get
our fleet to any point in a hurry, pro
vided its vessels could not give and
take in a contest with the enemy
fleet, after it got there. We are short
of capital ships aud the defect should
be remedied at the earliest possible
moment. An authorized fleet will
afford no protection. The Senate is
right in insisting on carrying out so
much of the program the first year.

After Trevino's soldiers at CarranzVs
orders, had shot up Captain Boyd's
men at Carrizi', Wilson sent "a stern
note" to ask Carranza what his course
was to be. And he demanded that the
answtr be transmitted by reguhr diplo
matic channels and not through sub
ordinate military officers. Evidently,
a written communication at the hand
of Senor Arrcndondo means more to
the administration at Washington than
a leaden missive Irom Trevino,
We now learn that one reason why
Mr. Wilson takes so mny trip? oa the
Mayflower is thit he wants to benefit
his health. This being the case, we
think it is time, in th; interest of
humanity for which Mr. Wilson is
always striving to amnge so that the
President cm hive all the tim:
there is to look afier his heahh. To
that er.d ne are urging the support ol
the R8publican ticket .
Jos phtis Daniels, indignant denial
ol the report that he will resign was
unnecessary. He knows that this Is
his first and last opportunity to hold
high place and he has no intention to
let go. Equally redundant was his
declaration that he intends to take an
active part in Wilson's campaign for
re election. A sense ol propriety is
not one of his strong points. The
first assertion is disheartening. The
measurably k' i lieni ig lor the more
time Josephs takes away from
the Navy Djputment iu the pursuit of
his activities in th; political campaign
the less time h will hive to continue
his bedeviling ol th Nivv.
