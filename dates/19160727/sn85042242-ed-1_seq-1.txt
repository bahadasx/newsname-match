Ruling of Supreme Law Body
Leaves Board Without Money
to Pay Clerks.
"ONE MAN DOESN'T NEED
LESS HELP THAN THREE"
Judges Do Not Give Decision on
Constitutionality of Cre­
ating Act.
The tax commission's contention
that it was entitled to $16,800 for
clerk hire instead of $8,000 was over­
ruled yesterday in an opinion handed
down by the supreme court. It was
written by Judge Goss.
Wide interest had been aroused in
the case because of the possibility of
the court ruling on the constitutional­
ity of the act creating the tax com­
mission, a decision which would have
effected the board of regents and the
immigration commission, and might
have compelled the calling of an ex­
tra session o? the legislature. But
the court found that without taking
Into consideration this question the
commission was not entitled to the
extra sum.
Wallace for Commission.
George E. Wallace of the tax com­
mission argued the case for the com­
mission and Attorney General Linde
for Carl Jorgenson, state auditor. It
was in the form of a writ of mandam­
us compelling the auditor to substi­
tute the money appropriated in the
act of 1911, creating the commission,
for the amount appropriated by the
1915 legislature for clerk hire.
The legislature of 1915, while in­
tending to pass a bill reducing the
membership of the tax commission
from three to one, passed an appro­
priations measure that carried $3,000
a year for one commissioner, $2,400
a year for a secretary and $4,000 for
clerk hire. But the bill for a one-man
commission did not pass.
Allow Three Commissioners.
The commission then brought ac­
tion to have the original appropria­
tion made in the act of 1911 provid­
ing $3,000 a year each for three com­
missioners substituted for the 1915
appropriation. The supreme court up­
held this' contention.
In this case the tax commission
asked to have the appropriation made
for" 'clefk hire in the act of 1911 sub­
stituted for the budget of 1915, giv­
ing them $16,800 for the biennial per­
iod instead of $8,000.
"No Need for More Help."
The supreme court ruled that there
was no reason why a three-man com­
mission should require more clerk
hire than a one-man commission and
that the legislature had made the ap­
propriations for clerk hire in 1915 on
the recommendation of the three-man
commission.
"The legislature," says the opiinon,
"in nine instances, including the pro­
vision for salary of the secretary of
the board, in making the appropria­
tion granted to the dollar the request
of the present three-man commission
and in only two Items out of the elev­
en was any change made from what
was requested, and these in the items
of furniture and fixtures and travel­
ing expenses. For the former the ap­
propriation of $500 was made in lieu
of $1,200, requested."
Got What They Requested.
"When the fact is considered that
the commission was organized, estab­
lished and had been doing business
for years, it would seem that the leg­
islature might properly deem it part
of wisdom to grant $500, for such
a purpose instead of $1200, as asked.
And the same is true as to the $4,000
item requested for traveling expense,
for which $2,220 was appropriated in
Subdivision 18. From the fact that
this item appropriated is not a round
sum, as $2,000 or $2,500, }t would not
fbe speculation to assume that some
calculation was made and care used
in arriving at the certain sum «of
$2,220 appropriated. The total re­
quest was for but $2,320 more than
was granted for the biennial period.
There was allowed this commission
within $1,160 per year of all it re­
quested. Few departments of state
were treated as well by the legisla­
ture. Over $5,000 was cut from ap
porpriations desired for the use of
this court and the state law library.
Under these circumstances and actu­
ating facts should any court hold that
these eleven items of Subdivision 18
were inadvertently passed as an ap­
propriation for such expenses of a
commission other than this tax com­
mission? And this too when the
amounts in nine oat of eleven of said
items are exactly what was requested
by the present commission? Mani­
festly not? The contrary is conclus­
ively demonstrated to be the fact, al­
most beyond a reasonable doubt."

AIR BUBBLES ENTER
BRAIN OF PATIENT
Some Peculiar Conditions Sur­
round Death of Miss
Ratcliffe.
Olney, 111., July 26.—An explanation
of the circumstances, to which are
attributed the death of Miss Eliza­
beth Ratcliffe, near here late Friday
night, was given today by H. G. Mor­
ris, state's attorney. Because of the
girl's death, Roy Hinterliter is await­
ing action by the 'November grand
jury. He was held without bail after
the verdict of the coroner's jury yes­
terday.
The death of Miss Ratcliffe, it is
claimed Iby the state's attorney, was
due to a bungling attempt to perform
an illegal operation. Air bubbles, it
is claimed, entered the circulatory
system of the young girl, and when
they reached the heart or brain,
death resulted.
State's 'Attorney Morris today gave
out a statement explaining the patho­
logical feature of the case, stating
that the autopsy showed that the girl
was in a delicate condition. The
prosecutor added:
"There were no exterior marks of
violence. Three experienced surgeons
found all organs perfectly normal."
"In cutting into the right ventricle,"
he continued, "air escaped. The
heart was perfectly healthy. When
the surgeons removed the top of the
skull, they noticed bubbles of air. All
blood vessels of the brain showed air
circulation. There were no structur­
al changes, but on a test the brain
floated in water. There was no ten­
sion of the lungs.

Mill Owned by Washburn Mill­

by Fierce Blaze.
Washburn, N. D., July 26.—The
large mill at Washburn, owned by the
Washburn Milling Co., was almost en­
tirely destroyed by fire this week.
The damage was partially covered by
insurance but the estimated damage
is $15,000.
The origin of the conflagration is
unknown but it is believed the mill
caiught tire from the severe lightning
storm experienced here. The local fire­
men responded to the alarm promptly
but on arriving at the scene found
the flames had gained such headway
that it was practically impossible to
save the structure. It is due to their
strenuous efforts that nearby proper­
ty and considerable flour stored in
sheds adjoining the mill were saved.
The Washburn mill was erected in
1883 iby Veeder and Satterland and
since that time has been in operation
every season. Two years ago the
mill was rebuilt and all modern ma­
chinery installed. The product of this
mill supplied nearly the entire de­
mand in this vicinity and the loss is
a severe blow to milling operations.

to just when they will rebuild.

OFFICER BLAMELESS
San Antonio, Texas, July 25.—The
official report on th(^ killing of Col.
-M. C. Butler at Alpine, Texas, last
week, by Harris Spannell completely
dead- qtto&r 51
The report transmitted to (General
Funston today by Co}. J. A. Gaston,
district commander with headquarters
at Marfa, says that Col. Butler was
aware that Spannell was jealous of
his wife and took care never to be
with her when others were not pres­
ent.
The immediate incident that led to
the killing of the Colonel and Mrs.
Spannell is described in the report.
Col. C.aston, who immediately left
for Alpine, following reports of the
shooting, says that Col. Butler and
Mr. and Mrs. Spannell had gone to
the home of a friend who was ill,
and on their return to the hotel where
all lived, it was suggested that every­
one, as a precaution, should wash
their hands.
Col. Gaston says that shortly after
this Spannell went to the Butlers'
room and finding, apparently, only
Col. Spannell and Mrs. Butler there,
began to upbraid his wife. At this
point, however, Mrs. Butler came out
of the back room, and pointed out to
him that she was one of the party.
Soon after Spannell took the Colo­
nel and Mrs. Spannell on the ride
that ended in their being killed.
