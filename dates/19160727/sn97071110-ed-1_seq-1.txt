Farming as a successful business cannot,'
be judged by the price a consumer pays for
for the article. The farmer, generally, is
supposed to get 35c on the dollar. When he
averages it for the whole crop he is pretty
well satisfied. That amount is acceptable
to us. Some products start off well early in "
the season. But when the consumer gets
his fill or other conditions take a whack at'
the price, we are glad to come Out whole on '
average. For instance, green stringless
beans sell for 5c lb. now. The merchant -pays
us 3c, making a profit of 661. It costs
us nearly 2c a lb. to pick the beans as they
ought to be picked. - That leaves us a cent
a pound for growing them--iust the cost of
the seed. The market regulates the price
of our products, but you may be sure of this
the quality of our vegetables is NoftPirefl.

This store never wab-
bles on the question of greater-value-giving. Our
merchandise is purchased on a quality basis from
such quality clothes makers as
THE HOUSE OF
KUPPENHEIMER
We believe in the thoroughfcpodnessbf these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
,We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
Value. ' .

PEACE OFFICER
AKENTUCKIAN
J. K. CARSON BLUE GRASS NATIVE
Chief Keeps Hood River One of Cleanest
Towns in Oregon Father of
Big Family
You may travel many leaguea and
Inspect many towns before you find a
cleaner, morajjy ai well aa otherwise,
little town than Hood River. Even in
the early spring months when scores of
nomad travelers, nondescript human
beings, tramps and outcasts, are trav
eling up and down the Columbia river
gorge, the undesirable element is kept
moving, and but few robberies, burg
laries or petty thefts are aver heard of
in Hood River. Woe be to the tramp
that happens to endeavor to linger too
lorjg around here or down in the jungles
of willows and cottonwood.
I If the hobo lingers he will aoon see,
very likely, a tall, serious faced man,
wearing a heavy blue coat, designating
bis authority of police officer, bearing
down upon him. The owner of the face
and tbe cost will be J. K. Carson, a
man known to every Hood River man,
woman and child.
If the unwelcome visitor complies
with Marshal Carson's request and
seeks temporary residence in some
quarter far removed, all well and good.
Mr. Carson will accompany bim, per
haps to the edge of the city, silent and
serious. If the tramp attempts to ob
ject or make excuses, he will soon dis
cover that be has met with an arbi
trary minion of the law. Different
remarks of the men with whom he
deals in the jungles affect, Mr. Carson
in different manner. Sometimes it will
appeal to his sense of humor and he
will emit a dry laugh as he enforces
bis commands. Sometimes he grows
angry and begins to talk. When this
occurs, as (ramps who have traveled
this way have learned, something is
imminent. Mr. Carson is not averse
at times to giving a recalcitrant hobo
a sound thrashing.
But Mr. ('arson is a pretty good
judge of human nature. Often in his
rounds of the jungles he will run across
some bit of human driftwood that is
harmless, a man who is in need of help
and sympathy, a man not all lost, one
who just needs a helping hand to lift
him from the rut. J. K. never hesi
tates when he finds such a human be
ing. He has helped many a man to
secure work. It is rare that he is ever
fooled in his judgment.
By ' night and day, summer and win
ter, J. K. Carson is on the lookout for
the" good of the town of Hood River.
Some of his townspeople no doubt crit
icise at moments. No publie official
ever escaped criticism. Mr. Carson
does his duty as he sees it He perhaps
realizes that the commendation of his
actions overweigha the criticism.
J. K. Carson is a native of Kentucky.
He was born near Somerset May 4,
1864.v He was a member of a family
of if children, seven sons and four
daughters. Mr. Carson's fsther passed
away in 1899. His mother died'in 1903.
Tbe south is noted for its big families.
Mr. and Mrs. Carson are believers in
ttfe old fashioned custom. They have
six boys and six daughters. All of the
children are living.
Peculiarly, many of Hood River
peace officers are Kentuckians. Sheriff
Johnson, a brother-in-law of Marshal
Carson, hails from the Blue Grass.
Deputy Sheriff Hart is another Ken
tuckian. Robert Lewis, Mr. Carson's
predecessor, was a native Kentuckian.
Mr. Carson was a farmer boy, but at
an early age began railroading and
Boon entered the mercantile business.
He was united in marriage to Miss
Sallie A. Johnson, of Boone county,
Kentucky, on January 8. 1891. Fol
lowing his wedding Hood Rivers' pres
ent city marshal spent two years en
gaged with a McKinney, Ky., mercan
tile firm. He then became proprietor
of the leading hotel of the Blue Grass
city.
Later he entered the general mer
chandise business" for himself. Fol
lowing his father s death Mr. Carson
returned to his mother's farm, where
he remained until the latter a.deatb.
In 1903 he came with his family to
Hood River. Mr. Carson began work
immediately with J. H. Gill, who was
at that time in the mercantile busi
ness. Later he was employed by W.
M. Stewart in the latter' hardware
and furniture store. For tbe'paat three
years he has been chief of police.
No man in Mood Kiver is more en
tbusiastio over fraternal organization
work than J. K. Carson. On his 21st
birthday he was initiated in the Mc
Kinney. Ky.. lodge A. F. & A. M. He
held various offices of the lodge. Af
ter coming to Hood River ha entered
other Masonic organizations, and is
now a member of all local bodies, irom
the Blue Lodge to the Commandery of
Knights Templar. He is a member of
AI Kader Temple or the Mystic surine
in Portland. In 1912 Mr. Carson was
High Priest .of the local Chapter,
Royal Arch Masons. ' At the recent
meeting of the Royal & Select Masters
of Oregon, Mr. Carson was made Grand
Sentinel for the state. ..
. Mr. Carson has been a prominent
member of the Order of the Eastern
Star. He is a Past Chancellor Com
mander of the Knights of Pythias.
Mrs. Carson is also prominent in
Eastern Star circles. She is now
Worthy Matron of the Chapter.

Traveling either way you soon mount

A trip to Green Point Is not only

you may see some of the most unique

LITTLE AUTO TRIPS

PREHARVEST ESTI
MATES SWATTED
Commenting on preharveat estimates
of tbe fruit cropa ot Washington dis
tricts as compiled by horticulturists of
different points Wilmer Sieg says:
"l he estimates are wonderful. I no
tice the following definite possible and
apparently probable yields for Wash
ington, according to district horticul
turists: Apples, 14,967 carloads ; pears,
1212 carloads: peaches. 1008 carloads :
other fruits, 64 carloads.
' Such figures show one of the great
est faults of Northwestern fruit men.
They are prone to cross bridges before
(hey reach them, and always, it seems,
they are the victims of exaggeraton.
It takes a wonderful imagination to
estimate to the box a crop of apples for
s state. As we have found in past
seasons it is impossible to tell just how
much iruit we are going to have until
it is in the box in warehouses.
'Conservative men are placing the
yield of northwestern boxed apples at a
much smaller figure than the data
shown by the Washington horticultur
ists would lead ona to believe correct.
Yet this business of overestimating
before we have any fruit to sell always
results in a harmful boomerang.''
RECORD CROWD HEARS
BILLY SUNDAY PREACH
From the crowds that began to pour
into Hood River at an early hour Sun
day morning one might have thought
that it was a circus day. It waa a
gathering of the clans to hear Rev.
Billy Sunday, noted baseball evangel
ist deliver bis annual vacation sermon
at the Asbury church. Although the
preaching did not begin until 10.30
o'clock, people began to arrive aa early
as nine in order that they might get a
seat.
The big church, tbe largest in Hood
River, was packed to its limit. Chairs
were placed in the aisles. People stood
on the outside, listening at windows,
and in tbe vestibules. When Rev. sun-
day mounted tbe pulpit the vast audi
ence arose en mass, waving handker
chiefs and cheering, giving tbe Chau
tauqua salute. A large part of tbe
audience was made up of automobile
parties who bad motored here from ad
joining cities.
MANY ATTEND THE
DUFUR ROAD MEETING
S. Benson an John B. Yeon, of Port
land, were the principal speakers at
the good roads meeting of the Wacao
County Farmers' Educational and Co
operative Union, held at Dufur Satur
day. J. T. Roric and J. L. Kelly, of
The Dalles, and Ur. n. U. Uodds, of
Dufur. also delivered short addresses.
The meeting was in the interest of
the proposed bond issue of l2tJO,000
for permanent highways in Wasco coun
ty. If this bond issuue carriea the
state highway commission will build
tbe Columbia highway from Hood Kiver
to Mosier. and of the bond issue. $91.-
000 will be used upon this highway
from Mosier via Dry creek to The
Dalles, and 334,000 to continue this
highway east from The Dalles to Pet
ersburg.
Tbe remainder oi this bond issue,
$1135. 000. will be used upon The Dalles-
California highway, extending south
from The Dalles more than 80 miles,
through Dufur. Tvgh Valley. Mauoin.
Shaniko, and Antelope to the Jefferson
county line.
Mr. Benson and Mr. Yeon each
heartily endorsed the bond method of
raising money lor tbe permanent high
way. .
MUCH ACTIVITY SEEN
ON WATER FRONT
Due to the opening of the Columbia
River highway, waterfront activity
bat never been so marked as during
the present summer season With all
river steamers and local ferry boats
landing in a small estuary, made by
back water In deep sloughs, a bustle is
seen along tbe water front from dawn
till twilight. Houseboata of fishermen
and river boatmen have been anchored
near the high water landing.
Tbe temporary wharves, during the
high water stage ot tbe Columbia, are
at the foot of First street, a few hun
dred feet from the very heart of tbe
business section, and because , or tbe
convenience In going to and from
boats, much greater use is made of
river transportation lines than in tbe
season of low water, when the wharves
are moved to the east side of Hood
river, more than a half mile from tbe
cit.
Many have row boats and canoea on
the river, and during recent late after-
noona and evenings these small craft
mav be seen scooting In and out ox tbe
vistas made by tbe tall cottonwoods
that grow on the lowlands.
The ferry systems have done a record
business already this season although
tourist travel Is just begun. Frequent'
ly aa many as a score of automobiles
cross the wmmoia in aay time.
BENSON OFFERS
$500F0R ROAD
TO BE APPLIED TO RUTHTON GRADE
Action Stimulates Desire of Hood Riter
Hen to Eliminate Worst Place on
Colombia Hirer Highway
Stimulated by an offer of S. Benson.
who has proposed to County Judge
Stanton to head a subscription list with
an appropriation of $500 for the work,
local good roads enthusiasts are plan
ning a campaign to raise funds with
which to build a stretch of Columbia
River highway around Ruthton bill,
now the worst piece of road between
here and Portland.
Mr. Benson's offer has appealed to
tbe hotel men, who offer to supplement
the road improvement fund by band-
some appropriations. Judge Stanton is
enthusiastic over the proposition. He
bss instructed county Engineer Hurl
burt to make an estimate of tbe cost
of the proposed work. The survey has
already been made by J. A. Elliott, en
gineer oi tbe Mate Highway Commission.
"I propose." ssys Judge Stanton,
that we assist with the proposed road
construction by another good roads
day. A great deal could be accom-
flushed by a hundred or two volunteer
aborers and several scores of wagons
and teamsters."
Judge Stanton announces that Mr.
Benson will make the mile of road west
of Cascade Locks to be donated by bim
to Hood Kiver county, ten ieet wide
instead of nine, as had been formerly
planned.
ROUND UP STAGE
IS BEING SET
With conditions practically insuring
an attendance in excess of the great
crowds of 1912 and 1913 when 75,000
people witnessed the exhibition, the
board of directors has dated the sev
enth annual Pendleton Round Up for
September 21, 22 and 23, and made pre
paration for increased seating capacity
in the bleachers and the greatest exhib
ition ever staged. The railroads have
increased the territory included in the
Round Up special rates so that this
year they will extend as far east as
Salt Lake on the Union Pacific : Mis
soula. Mont., on the Northern Pacific
and south to San Francisco and north
to British Columbia.
The fact that the RoJnd Up is the
biggest and practically the only attrac
tion of national interest on the Pacific
coast this fall has caused the eastern
and tranacontinental lines to advertise
it extensively and use .it as a basis for
western tourist business. This will
bring many additional thousands to the
annual frontier show.
The show itself will be superior to
anything heretofore staged. More and
better bucking horses than ever will
be up for the rides, the relay races
will have not leas than 10 strings of
four horses each and there will be more
competitors from all over the west in
the steer roping and buiidogging.
More than a thousand applications
for ticket reservations have been re
ceived which is the biggest number
ever received at this season for any
one of the former Round Ups. Many
noted people of national fame contem
plate being present. Secretary of
Treasury McAdoo has already assured
the Round Up that he will be present.
CONVENIENT BOAT
SERVICE INAUGURATED
Hood River people may now travel
conveniently by the Regulator Line's
Columbia river boats. The company
has made arrangements with the Fash
ion Livery Company, whereby automo
biles will haul passengers to and irom
the wharfs of tbe stesmer line at no
additional charge. A ticket office has
been established at the office of the
Fashion company at the foot of Oak
street.
Anyone desiring to travel by the
Regulator'a line may telpehone to the
Fashion barn for tickets and reserva
tion. Cars will go anywhere in the
city limits for passengers for the boats
which are now making their regular
daily schedules.
W.N. Winter Will Resign
J. E. Smithson, manager of the tele
phone company, who has just returned
from Everett, Wash., where Mr. Win
ter is now located as president and
manager of the Puget Sound Telephone
Co., announces that at the next meet
ing of the board of directors of the
Oregon-Washington Telephone Co. W.
N. Winter will tender his resignation
aa president.
Mr. Winter, who was formerly man
ager of the local company as well as
president, left here last winter to take
charge of the Puget Sound concern,
which waa organized by tbe amalgama
tion of a number of independent com-
Sanies. Mr. Winter, it is stated by
Ir. Smitbson, who is slated to aucceed
him, desires to resign from the office
of chief executive of the local company
since all of his time is consumed in his
duties with the new company. Mr.
Winter will remain on the local board
of directors.
Auto Stolen Saturday Night
Within a few hours after the automo
bile of D. H. Drewery was stolen from
the corner of Third and Cascade avenue
Saturday night. City Marshal Carson
discovered the car, with all doors
opened, abandoned on the Heights in
the rear of A. C. Staten's store.
Marshal Carson and Mr. Drewery had
been making a round of the valley in
search of the machine, thinking aome
mischievous boys might have taken it
to reach one of the dances in progress
in the rural communities. After mid
night, aa the party was returning to
town, Mr. Drewery stopped the auto
mobile he was driving at tba Staten
eofner, to allow Mr. Carson to go to his
borne. Before the officer had walked
200 feet be found tbe lost car.
It ia thought alia culprits abandoned
the machine when they heard tbe auto
mobile in which the officer waa riding
stop. .
