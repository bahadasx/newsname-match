HINTS ON HARVESTING CROPS FOR SILO
Qual'tv of Silage Depends Upon Crops Being Cut at Right Stage-
Cut Corn When Grains Are Well Dented and Glazed and Lower
Leaves Brown—Cut Pea Vines and Soy Beans When in Full
Bloom and a Few Heads Art Ripe—Plenty of Help Essential—
Silage Mus. Be Well Packed for Best Results.
-
The time of harvesting the crop for filling the silo—that is, the stags
In which the crops should be harvested—must be given consideration if a
good quality of silage is to be obtained.
Corn is ready to harvest for filling the silo about the same time it is
ready for harvesting fodder; the grains should be well dented and glazed, and
a few of the lower leaves have turned brown. If the corn is cut too green
the silage will be sour, and the feeding value decreased, wMle, on the other
hand, if the corn is too ripe it will not pack well in the silo, a large amount
cf water will be necessary to insure its keeping quality, and there is danger
of dry rot, which lowers the feeding value.
Sorghum should be harvested for the silo when the seed are in the dough
stage. Like corn, if it is left in the field until it becomes too dry, the silage
will contain a great amount of indigestible material, and will not make a
good quality of silage.
Pea vines, soy beans and other hay crops should be harvested for the silo
at the same time as for making hay—that is, when in full bloom and a few
of the heads are ripe. " „
Methods of Harvesting Silage Crops.
j The corn harvester is becoming very popular for harvesting corn for flll
| ing the silo, and the work is carried on much faster than when the hand
not hod of cutting is practiced; however, If the amount of corn or other crops
used is not large enough to justify the expense of a harvester, hand cutting
may be done.
In determining the size of the cutter, engine, and other machinery to
be purchased, the amount of work to be done should be taken into consider
ation. The cutter should be large enough to carry on the work as fast as
the entire force of men employed can get the crop to the cutter, and, on the
Oiher hand, the cutter should not be too large for the engine that is to
drive it.
The large cutters, having self-feeding devices, afford th® greatest capacity
and save a large amount of labor which is required in th® operation of th®
smaller machines.
Filling the 8ilo.
The silage cutter should be placed within a few feet of th® silo and the
piping should be run straight from the cutter to the top of the silo, where it
must take a turn, or bend, in order to carry the silage iato the silo. If the
cutter is placed farther than a few feet away, and it becomes necessary to
make elbows in the pipe, this stops the force of the blower and may cause
trouble in filling, extra power from the engine, and decreased progress in the
work.
from data gathered from a number of farmers over the state, the average
cost of filling the silos has been 60 cents per ton. The cost of filling depends
upon the distance the crop is hauled, the condition of the crop, the method
of harvesting and the cost of labor. The crops intended for silage should
be grown as near the silo as is practicable.
When the filling is started it should be rushed and enough labor employed
to keep up with all parts of the work.
The silage should be well packed and evenly distributed over the entire
surface of the silo, so that the grain and fodder will be well mixed. If the
crop used for filling the silo is very dry, water should be added in sufficient
quantity to moisten it.
While the silo is being filled it will require two or more men being kept
In it all the time. That portion of the silage near the walls and on the edges
should be packed very tight, as it does not setUe as readily as that nearer

BEAN ANTHRACNOSE, OR
POD SPOT DISEASE.
Readily Controlled by Use of Home
Grown Seed—Plant In Summer
and Mature In the Fall.
Under Louisiana conditions, th®
bean anthracnose, or pod spot dis
ease, can be readily controlled by th®
use of home-grown seed. The fungus
which causes the disease is not able
to endure the continued high tempera
ture of the .summer months. By tax
ing advantage of this weakness of the
fungus, we can grow seed ftw home
planting that will be free of the dis
ease. We can plant the seed in the
summer and have the beans mature in
the fall. The fall-grown seed is free
of the disease and can be used the
following spring for the main crop of
beans. Not only will it produce beans
as early and as good as will northern
grown seed, but it will produce pods
free of the anthracnose disease.
We have found that for conditions
at Baton Rouge that for a fall crop rt
's best to plant the seed during the
drat two weeks of August. For condi
ions in the northern part of the state,
'he seed should probably be planted
a week earlier; and for conditions be
low New Orleans any time during Au
gust would probably be satisfactory. It
is not advisable to plant the seed
earlier in the summer as beans will
not set pods during the hot summer
months. The seed should be planted
so that the flowering period will come
during the cooler weather of early
fall.

FALL CROP OF IRISH
POTATOES.
Sprout Seed Well Before Planting—
Plant Small-Sized Tuber», Whole;
Otherwise Will Probably Rot.
From the 10th to the 20th of August
Is the best time to plant for the fail
crop .of Irish potatoes, depending, of
course, on the condition of the soil
and how much the tubers have sprout
ed before planting. Seed potatoes
should be well sprouted before plant
ing; otherwise they will not havj time
to mature a crop.
Medium to small-sized tubers should
be used for the fall crop, planting
them whole. If cut, the pieces gener
ally rot without producing a plant.
Potatoes for the fall crop should be
planted deeper than for the spring
crop, so as to get the tubers down into
cool soil, where they will push out
and grow with greater vigor than
when planted shallow.
About the first of August a cron of
half-matured cow peas should bo turn
ed under deep and the land ha\rosed
and rehurrowed at Intervals uiui? ;he
middle of August or later, wh n
fixating should be done.
FARMER LEARNED TO KEEP
BOOKS; NOW HAS BANK
ACCOUNT. ^
- v
Record Should Be Kept of Each Crop
—Mean« Greater Profit.
A farmer who kept an account of ar
Irish potato crop was so pleased with
What he learned that he decided to
keep accounts of all his crops the next
year. He soon had a bank account
and farming daily greW more interest
ing to him.
Every farmer should keep books so
•that he may have accurate -informa
Mon about his business and may know
the cost of labor, machinery and raw
material. It is important to know the
cost of producing each pound of cot
ton or hay and each bushel of corn or
oats. Do not figure on the basis that
it will cost so much to prepare the
land, so much for planting and bo
much for cultivating. That is like
figuring in the air. What you want to
know is not what it costs anybody, but
what did it cost you on your farm
as you raised it. Keep the record
once and learn something new.
A farmer should be a better corn
raiser next year than he is this year,
keeping an accurate account of the
cost of producing his crop will help
him to improve. Bookkeeping is ?
method of accurate and painstaking
thinking abut one's business. That's
reason enough why a farmer should
keep books. R. L. Himes,

LESPEDEZA EASILY HAR

Hay Is Rich in Protei.. -Relished By
Live Stock—No Waste In Feeding.
No other hay crop allows such a
wide period of time in which harvest
ing may be done as lespedeza. The
harvest season may extend from late
August to late October, including thi
hay and seed crop. In fact, new les
pedeza begins to come into local mar
kets in late July. Such early cutting
however, will not yield a large crop
although the quality is excellent, a
there are no leafless stems. Whin
under f-vorable conditions, a secom
cutting may be secured, ff; will tr
short, either for seed or for hay, sn 1
should continued dry weather folio"
such early cutting, the stand may t.
seriously damaged. It is not improb?
ble that with a better understanding
of the plant we will make two cut
tings per season, when the most fa
vorable conditions of growth prevail.
Lespedeza matures for harvest m
September and October, when the
weather for hay-making is usuall;'
fine.
