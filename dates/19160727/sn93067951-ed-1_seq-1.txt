CORRESPONDENCE
BETHESDA
The rain seems to have done
great damage to the crops in
this section, but the Lord knows
best and we ought to submit
mrselves to his will.
Most of the ;ni 118 in this secton
are stopped on account of
nolcen dauis. Mr. Boan's fish
lam melted away in the rain.
We see more candidates anlounced
in The Advertiser.
That will help make the days
deasanter with all the hands to
hake. There are four Magistrate
andidates from thiss ection, and
fe hear that Mr. J. E. Williams
s going to try to get Mr. II. A
loan to come out yet. That
fill give us five, but we think
lr. Boan is doing very well at his
nb. We don't doubt Mr. Boan
eing as well qualified as any
f the rest of us, but he is dome
ery well on the farm.
There is going to be a Children's
)ay at Bethesdia July 31st.
iverybody is cordially invited
) come with well-filled baskets
f something good to eat.
Mr. Robert P. Turner is doing
)me good work in the meeting
t Bethesda. The children's
>ay exercises were very interestig.
Miss Klizabeth Jordon and Mr. I
[arian Boan visited the latter's i
arents Saturday and Sunday. I
hoy report great damage in the I
ash section by the wind and i
lin. i
Messrs. Grant and Tiller were '
i our section last Saturday. 1
When you hear a man talking
jout the wrong doings of his
iighbor you may be pretty sure 1

i he ought to be or lie would be (

The Death Of
i Mr. Mack Davis
The community was profoundj
ly shocked last Friday morning /
, when word was passed around
that Mr. Mack Davis, assistant
. cashier of the Peoples Bank, had
[ committed suicide in the public
, school building.
Mr. Davis was a highly respec,
ted citizen, having served in an
; oilicial capacity in this bank
since its organization about six
years ago. Later investigation
has shown that all his financial
all airs are in first class condition.
His relations with the bank are
said to have been above reproach.
There is no known motive for
his rash act other than failing
health. It is believed that this
nas lor tne past year caused mm
considerable worry.
Some ten days previous Mr.
Davis had borrowed a shot gun
from Dr. R. L. McManus, saying
that he wished to shoot birds
He started out with the gun last
Thursday declaring that he was
going to the woods to shoot birds,
but on being told that it was too
wet, teturned. On Friday morning
he arose early and went out
with the gun. Two hours later
a gunshot was heard but as it
was diflicult to locate, it was soon
forgotten until a little girl playing
about the building ran out
raying that some one was in the
building lying down. The investigation
which followed revealed
the fact that a terrible tragedy
had been enacted.
The coroner's inquest, conducted
by Magistrate M. 8.Watson,
found that the deceased had
come to his death from gunshot
wounds self-inllicted.
Funeral services were conducted
at the Methodist church Sunday
morning, interrment taking
place iiiimediatly afterward at
the Chesterfield Cemetery.
A Brass Band
For Chesterfield
The movement referred to
some time ago in these columns
to organize a brass band for
Chesterfield has not died nor
gone into summer quarters but
is moving right along with the
best of prospects for a full realization
of its laudable aim.
Though the movement, we believe,
was originated by two of
?ur local -ecret orders, this a
free-for-all proposition. It will
not be directed nor guided by
the orders mentioned as such.
'J'he W. O. Wa. and the .Juniors
tarted the funds by a contribution
of $f>0 each and an a dditimal
have been subscribed
by individuals. The contribution
box is still open.
There is a cordial invitation to
every young man in and near
town who can play a musical instrument
or who would like to
icarn to get on 1 he band wagon
by applying to Mr. VV. li. Ilun ycutt.
It is the intention of those
fathering this movement to raise
sullicient funds at once to buy
instruments,but members will be
allowed to furnish and own their
instruments
Now let every musically inclined
young man within roach of
Chesterfield come forth and
join the band. The age limit,
we understand is indefinitely fixed
somewhere between l."> and
100 years, though younger or
>lder people will be admitted on
mbmitting evidence of sullicieut
musical ability.
