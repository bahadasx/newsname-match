(By B. F. FLY.)
Col. D. J. Baker, Jr., commanding
officer of the Twenty-first infantry,
acted as toastmaster at one of the
most unique banquets ever staged in
V
Yuma. Last night was the time, and
the spacious dining room of the new
Southern Pacific hotel was the place.
Earlier in the day covers had geen
ordered for an even dozen, hut later
in the afternoon the order was chang
ed to the "lucky thirteen," that being
the recognized lucky number for the
famous 21st infantry
The ocuasion was a sort of farewell
dinner to Col. F. H. French, the hon
ored and beloved regimental comman
der until a few days agOj when he
was appointed a member of the gen
eral staff, a position that falls to the
lot of but few men in the army, and
therefore a position that is very
much prized in army circles, for to
the general staff is left the policy of
the entire army. It is upon their
judgment that the President and Sec
retary of War must depend in times
of war, or in preparing for war. In
fact the general staff is regarded as
all-powerful in militarf matters of ev
ery character.
Col. French is greatly beolved by

every man in his regiment. He is
not only every inch a soldier, as his
long record amply testifies, but he
is one of those soldiers who at al!
times and under all sorts of circum
stances looks out for his men, and
honors his superiors. That he was
not recently promoted to a brigadier
general was a source of great disap
pointment to his regimental officers
and men in the line, but the genial
Colonel has not given utterance to
a single note of discontent or disap
pointment. There were upwards of
thirty colonels, from which number
three were to be promoted. He was
not lucky enough to draw the prize,
but as matters have turned out he
drew a greater prize by being as
signed to the "general staff." It was
in honor of this that his former regi
mental staff officers tendered him
the banquet last night, for he is now
merely on waiting orders, and liable
to be called away at almost any hour.
There were quite a number of
speeches made during the course of
the evening, Colonel Baker's praise of
his former commanding officer being
appropriate and pathetic in the ex
treme. They all realized that never
again would they have Colonel French

The criminal misrepresentation of
Yuma weather by press reports emin-
ating from Los Angeles has long been
exasperating to those who know the
truth. The following dispatch this
afternoon is a fair sample. Read it:
CHICAGO, July 27 A period of
.intense heat unequalled m fifteen
years covers the western plains states
and is expected to continue till the
end of July. Chicago startel today's
temperature with S4, the hottest i lace
in the country except Yuma. Lowest
during the night, 84. Hotnort night in
history. Not a leaf stirring in Cana
dian Northwest, whence relief must
come.
Why this misrepresentation?
Eighty-four in Chicago is equal or
much worse than ihe top notch for
Yuma ever could be, 119 which
stands as the reco-l. tor Yuma is
cool compared to the present Chicago
heat, xcA a dozen towns of tho Im
perial Valley, below sea level, west of
Yuma are hotter by far, but Harrison
Gray Otis and William Randolph
Hearst never mention the fact. The
Yuma temperature at 100 and a hu
midity of 15, which is a fair average
for a Yuma summer day, is seldom op
pressive and it is outrageously unfair
to class Yuma with Chicago at SO or
Central Missouri at 108, as was the
case two weeks ago.

The people of Imperial Valley are
at last awakening from their Rip Van
Winkle siesta. But it has taken a
long time to make them open their
eyes. It was just one year ago that
their great danger was pointed out
in these columns. Since that time it
has been pointed out to them time
and time again that their canals were
silting up so rapidly that their crop
losses would amount to mililons of
dollars for the lack of water. Instead
of taking the good, friendly advice
given them through these columns
they heaped ridicule on me through
their various valley papers and eng
larged their farm area. And what's
the result?
They are now in a most deplorable
condition. They have something like
400,000 acres of fine land planted to
all the varous crops that are known
to thrive in that splendid section, but
they have water enough at the present
time to irrigate a scant one-tenth of
the cultivated area. And they con
tinue to get less and less water with
each succeeding day, andthis awful
situation will continue to become
worse until their new diversion dam
is made sufficiently strong to check
the entire flow of the mighty Colora

SPOKANE, Wash., July 27. Four
little girls are to begin here drawing
from a big iron drum the names of
persons who registered from July 5
to July 22 for land in the Colville In
dian reservation. The first name
drawn is to have the choice of select
ing any 160 acres or 320 ac s of land,
according to classification, within the
south half of the reservation. The
registration closed af midnight July
22 and Judge McPhaul, superintend
ept in charge of the registration and
drawing, estimated that 100,000 per
sons had registered.
It is thought 4,000 names will be

day's drawing. These persons will !

dam late yesterday afternoon and
watched the workmen for about an
hour.. T'ley have four small steel
cables stretched from bank to bank at
a point about 500 feet below the Al
lison dam of last year. These cables
are about five-eighths of an inch in
diameter, even smaller than the cable
upon which the ferry boat is operat
ed, a short distance above the old
dam, and which snapped in two
last winter with almost fatal results
to four or our citizens. Strung on
these four small cables are several
small barges upon which willow
limbs were piled to convey from one
side of the river to the other. With,
bated breath I watched the first two
barges start on their way across the
river, about a dozen workmen ac
companying the barges, the latter be
ing tied to the four cables. They got
about 100 feet away from the Califor
nia bank and then, well they be
came stuck hard and fast. The ca
bles had become embedded in the
river sand, and work and tug and
pull as hard as they might the barges
remained stuck hard and fast. I
watched the operations until the sun
drove me away. In the meantime the
bank of the river was alive with work-

I receive three notices informing them
at what time and place they are to
appear and select land. Th - first 100
will select September 5. After the
first .100 have selected their land
others . in the order in which their
names were drawn will be asked to
make selections.
The land is mostly lightly timbered
and can be used for grazing. The
better part of the reservation was
alloted to the Colville Indians. After
the forunate ones have indicated their
selections they -will be allowed ten
days in which to go to the land. They
then may finally conclude their bar
gain with the United States or forfeit
their chance.
