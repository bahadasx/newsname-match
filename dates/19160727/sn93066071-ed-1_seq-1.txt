BETTER LAWS FOR 'WOMEN.
Three laws hve been signed by Lou
isiana's Governor that will directly af
fect the women of the state. Ono stat
ute will enable women to dispose of
their separate property without the
eonsent of the husband ; another will
permit husband and wife to Cestlfy
gainst eaeh other. The third bill pro
poies the amendment of Article 2J0 p
the constitution so as to enable women
to serve on board of educational and
leemoslnary ins.ltutions.

MUNITIONS AND WfflKN.
Perhaps, after all, the British army
will owe its prowess to women as well
as to men. Biz hundred and sixty
thousand women oro making muni
tions alone. If these should remain in
their homes instead of going into fac
tories, what would become of the Brit
ish army? Don't you think that women
who help preserve tho country deserve
the vote?
DO YOU
Think dog muzzling cruel and then
Marvel at the spread of rabies?
Carefully select your brand of liquor
and then
Feed your children unpasteurized
milk?
Repeat the Golden Rule add tben
rJneese in somebody's face?
Go camping for your health and then
Place your toilet so that it drains Into
your water supply?
V. U. Stranathan was so unfortunate

lier." More tnan one hundred women
have received this red ribbon in recog
nition of their eminence and labors in
all the professions. They have quali
fied a writors, artists, actresses and
scholars In various schools. Upon what
flimsy excose can these superior wom

Young, sister of Mrs. Long, and Leo

daughter, Mils Rubottom, of Texat.
Mr. and Mrs. Roy Brown and the Sims
family, of the Kiowa neighborhood.
This congenial company enjoyed a
splendid dinner and a restful day in
the shade of the big trees, and bathing
In the cool waters of the Kiowa.
Anyone so'fortunate as to be a guest
of Mr. and Mrs. Sims knows just how
royally the crowd was entertained and
what a delightful day was spent on
this occasion. So pleased were the
guests that they were loath to leave
the charming company, but lingered
until after supper, returning home in
the cool of the evening.
Lenore Long and cousin, Elizabeth
Young, who had been spending the
week-end with Miss Lulu Sims return
ed to Beaver with the crowd.
FOREIGNERS-OR NATIVES. - '
Congress has been asked to appro
priate $50,000 for disseminating infor
mation r"grdlng the education of for
eigners. -This seems a large amount
in contrast to the meagre sum appro
prlaied for the Children's Bureau. Our
public schools are open to foreigners
who seek their privileges, and politi
cians solloitously attend to the procur
ing of citizenship. Wouldn't it be
better for Congress to appropriate
(50.000 to disseminate intormation re
garding the education of native born
American women on the proper use of
the ballot for the advancement of
American homes, and safety of Ameri
can-born children, and so stimulate
foreigners to Imitate these.
Miss Lulu Sims was up from the Ki
owa the first of the week. She return
ed home Wednesday, accompanied by
Misses Lenore Long and Elisabeth
Young, who will spend the week end
at Mr. Sims's pleasant home.

WILSON A SUFFRAGIST.
woman suffrage plank in the
PRESIDENT
The
Democratic platform was written by
President Wilson. Several other en
dorsements of votes for womsn were
suggested, but, after long disouHton
and deliberation, the Presldept sakf .'
"I shall support its principles with sin
cere pleasure. I wish to Join with ;ny
fellow Democrats' in recommending to
the several states that they extend
suffrage to women on the same terms
as to men."
This is not a recent stand of the
Presideut, for during the last eleatlon
In New Jersey he voted for the woman
suffrage amendment. Its defeat at
that time wis due to the personal ac
tivity of of Now Jersey politicians, who
were not only hostile to woman suff
rage, but violently antagonistic to Mr.
Wilson.
Jim Geren, whoise home is in Rey
nolds county, Texas, but who was
working with a threshing crew near
Knowles, was stabbed ih the left lung
while engaged In an altercation with
another member of the crew Thursday
night of last week. He was thought
to be fatally wounded at the time, and
was brought to the Beaver Hospital
the following morning. Upon exam
ination Dr. Levi found the .wound to
be tour or five inches long, with a part
of the lung tissue hanging from the
cut. Young Green was operated upon,
the part of the lung removed, and the
wound closed with several stitches.
At"the-preent time he seems to be re
covering nicely, and indications point
to a full reoovery.
NURSERY FIMISHINGS Of USE ANDUAUTY
EVERY child notices the nature of its surroundings, and
a pretty, yet serviceable, nursery is something that
every family should have. Children's beds of all sizes,
low chairs, high chairs, baby carriages and gocarts can be
bad here. Articles of the durable sort that stand continued

UNIQUE DISPLAY AT MILES'S GROCERY.
J. 0. Miles, the popular nnd ginlal
grocer, whose puce oi business is
located next door to The Herald office,
has had a giant colTee pot on display in
his window for the past week. It is a
complete coffee pot in every particular

added to his already large and com
plete stock. He says that he ha sat

CHRISTIAN CHURCH SERVICES.

record breaking attendance for this 1

FYE GIRLS DECORATED.
Wonder what our girls will do next?
Five of, the Camp Fire Girls or Spring
Lake, N. Jj, heroically prevented a for
est fire- So remarkable were their ef
forts that the Department of Conserv
ation and Development awarded them
bodges of Merit. Surely these sensible
and courageous young women will
have intellect enough to rote in the
n'or future, and if the S'ato of New
Jersev doesn't wake up to the value of
its women's opinions, there are states,
like California and Illinois, that prob
ably estimate tbe opinions of young,
practical women. Go to a suffrage
state, qiiintette of splendid young
women, where you will have a chanco
to give your votes at well as your serv
ices to the welfare of society. If a few
or the irresponsible men of New Jersey
could hand their voting privileges out
to some ol the sagacious women of the
stati. political bosses might take to
the tall timber, or handle a' pick and
shovel for a decent living, Instead of j
grafting on tbn public and debauching
government.
N. D. NerT drove to Liberal Tuesday
with his brother) Alva, where the lat
ter took the train for Cameron, Mo.
We are sorry to report, that Alva has
been losing in health tor some time,
and at last decided that he would have
to make a change of locality in order
to regain his health, Alva's friends
and that includes everybody in Beaver
and vicinity are very sorry that his
tailing health compels him to leave us,
but all feel confident that as soon as
he recovers his health he will return
to ue again. The young boys especial
ly will miss Alva Nsff, for ho has'been
their kind guide and guard on many
fishing trips, and the mothers were
always willing for the boys to go on
fishing excursions if he went along to
care for them. We all hope that he
will soon be among us again, healthy
and happy.
