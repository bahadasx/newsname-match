SORE THEY CAN
HOLO THEIR OWN
Germans Gather Most Power
ful Aggregation of Artillery
Yet Accumulated in Any
Single Battle Theater.
Headquarters of the German army
on the Somme, July 25, via Berlin,
July 2G, to London, July 27. The
French and British, giving themselves
no rest, are continuing their efforts
to widen the sack-like position north
and south of the Somme, wherein they
are now pinned on three sides by
German armies. Both German offi
cers and men are confident of their
ability to hold their own and are
aided by the most powerful aggrega
tion of artillery which Germany has
as yet accumulated in any single bat
tle theater.
Yesterday afternoon, shortly after
the correspondents had left the bat
tlefield, an artillery duel of violent
proportions signalized the renewal of
the stuuggle. From the intensity of
the bombardment it was soon evident
that the main effort of the allies
would again be made on tho line from
Pezleres to Hardecourt the sector
which was the scone of such bitter
fighting from July 20 to July 23. Tho
bombardment continued with increas
ing intensity the whole -forenoon. To
ward evening an attack was made In
strong force by a British division
which was headed by picked troops
and bomb throwers.
Tho attackers wero able to estab
lish a foothold in tho German lines
but were later driven out by a Ger
man counter attack. Tho British also
succeeded in entering temporarily the
German trench system in the vicln
llty of Longueval and Gulllemont, but
here also were finally expelled.
General Foch supported his British
colleagues with a determined attack
south of the Somme. On tho blood
drenched terraine between Estrees
and Soyecourt he gained a few hun
dred meters of front line trendies
south of Estrees but was unable to
hold them.

SUBMARINE HAS
NOTJLEFT PIER
Baltimore, Mr., July' 27. If Captain
Koenfg of the merchant submarine
Deutschland plans to start today on
the return voyage to Germany, there
was nothing going on this morning at
the pier where the submersible is
berthed that was any more Indicative
of departure than has been the case
for the last few days.
Overnight developments in fact
tended to increase the probability of
a report lato last night that it had
been decided to hold the Deutschland
here until some word has been receiv
ed concerning her sister ship, the
Bremen. When Carl A. Luderitz, Ger
man consul here, announced that the
reception to Ambasador von Bern
storff which he had planned at his
home for last evening had been de
finitely postponed, he was asked when
the Deutschland would leave.
"She will not leave for a week,"
answered Mr. Luderitz. He would not
add lo this statement, however, when
he was asked the cause of further de
lay in the vessel's departure, although
clearance papers had been taken out.
The Deutschland's crew slept
aboard the Interned North German
Lloyd steamer Neckar last night.
Ships Have Strict Orders.
Washington, July 27. The British
ambasador said the ships had strict
orders not to enter the three mile
limit of American territorial waters
to waylay the German submarine
Deutschland or for any purpose and
tho admiral has reported that their
instructions had not been violated at
any time.
Mr. Polk was told that the British
admiral was very Indignant over the
report taht one of his cruisers had
made an Incursion into Chesapeake
bay.
SPANNELL awaits
ACTION OF JURY
Alpine, Texas, July 27. Harry J.
Spannell, manager of a local hotel,
was given a preliminary examination
on a charge of killing his wife and
Lloutenant-Colonei M. C. Butler, U.
S. A., here today before Justice
Ragln and remanded to jail without
bond to await action of the grand
Jury, which meets here September
11th.
Spannell, apparently crazed by
jealousy It is asserted, shot and
killed his wife, daughter of John Hol
land, a loading banker and cattleman
of West Texas, and the army officer,
a week ago today, while the three
wero riding In Spannell's motor car.
The shooting occurred on a residence
street In Alpine, causing much excite
ment throughout the section.
On Verge of Collapse.
When the prisoner was brought into
the court room it seemed obvious to
friends that he was on the verge of
collapse. Ho sobbed a greeting to the
few officers present and with blood
shot eyes searched the room. Ap
parently he paid little attention to the
legal fmases of the examination but
mumbled over and over again;
"Oh, my little girl! My little girl!"
referring apparently to his five-year-old
daughter now at the home of her
grandparents here.
The examination was perfunctory
and caused little excitement in the
community. Few persons in the town
realized it was being held, every ef
fort having been made to keep the
fact of Spannell's presence here a sec
ret because of the sentiment said to
have been manifested after the shoot
ing. Bound Over by Court.
Immediately after the court had
bound him over, Spannell was hand-:
cuffed, taken to a waiting automobile!
and driven rapidly out of town. He
was driven to Marfa and from there
he will be taken by train to El Paso
for safe keeping.
L. A. Dale of El Paso who appeared
today as Spannell's attorney, declined
to indicate the defense he would offer.
NATURAL GAS
WELL UNCOVERED
Cleveland Tunnel Explosion
Opens Flow of Gas Which
May Prevent Com
pletion. Cleveland, Ohio, July 27. Indica
tions that a well of natural gas was
uncovered by the tunnel explosion here
last Monday was reported today, by
L. M. Jones, the government mining
expert sent here from Pittsburg.
The flow of gas not only makes re
covery of the bodies In the wreck im
possible, but may prevent completion
of the tunnel, Mr. Jones said.
The gas well, according to the ex
pert, Is apparently of uncontrollable
proportions and the gas similar to
that at the suburb of Lakewood.
Despite this development prepara
tions for further exploration were
made today. The bodies lie behind a
cave-in nearly 300 feet long.
Special Machinery Needed.
Special machinery will be needed
to penetrate this wall of muck. It
will require several days digging to
reach the corpses, so in any event no
ntore bodies are expected to be found
for a week or more.
Waterworks officials said today
they believe there are only nine
bodies in the tunnel, instead of elev-.
en, as previously estimated. Patrick
Kerns, supposed to be entombed,
turned up alive today. He had over
stayed shore leave Monday and missed
death by a close margin. Justice
Aro, another thought to be. with the
ill-fated force, has also been reported
alive. This reduces the total loss of
life to nineteen.
The city investigation reached ex
amination of witnesses today.

SO-CALLED "CUREl 1 8
Special Instructions Sent to
Food and Drug Inspectors
to Be Particularly Alert. 8
Washington, July 27. Warning was 1 1
issued to the public today by the de- j f
partment of agriculture to look with j j
extreme suspicion upon any prepara
tion put on the market and offered for
sale as being effective for the treat- j
ment of Infantile paralysis.
Department officials charged with
the enforcement of the foods and I ,
drugs act, an announcement says, "ex-
pect the outbreak of infantile paraly- ;
sis will tempt unscrupulous persons '
to offer for sale so called 'cures' or j
remedies for this dread disease. They J
therefore have issued special instruc- j
tioni to food and drug Inspectors to : ;
be particularly alert for interstate !
shipment, or importation of medicines,
the makers of which allege that they i
will cure or alleviate this disease for
which at the. present .time no medi-. - nj
cinal cure is' known." ' tS !
Inspectors to Collect Samples. .I
Inspectors have been instructed to !
collect samples of all medicines found ,
in interstate commerce and officials !
declare the makers will be vigorously
prosecuted whenever the evidence 1
Warrants action under tl. food an1
drugs act. Such remedies offered for
import will be refused entry.
Government officials have noted
that in the past whenever a serious
epidemic has existed unscrupulous
dealers have preyed upon the fear, or
Ignorance, of the public by flooding j
the market with worthless, hastily j H
prepared concoctions, for which cura- J H
tlve properties which have no founda- jj
lion whatever in fact are claimed. In j 1
the present Infantile paralysis epl- I
demic inspectors already have discov- 1 1
ered shipments of a few such mix-
tures. I
States Must Watch. I
In its warning the department points I
out that the federal law does not ap-- "j Ii
ply to preparations made and consum- H '
ed wholly within a single state such IB
as patent medicines made within New i tt
York state and sold in New York City, ( I
the center of the epidemic. i j
"Persons buying os using a 'rem- ;
cdy' made in their own state, there- j f
fore," the announcement says, "must i 1
relv on the protection accorded them J
by "their local health authorities."
