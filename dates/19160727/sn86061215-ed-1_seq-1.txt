Douglas Haig, gives the British troops
domination of the highest point over
looking the plateau on which the Ger
man lines extend to the eastward.
Some of the most stubborn fighting
In the recent British offensive has oc
curred in the streets of this village
which the Germans had strongly forti
fied.
Every house had to be taken separ
ately and the British, after obtaining
possession of a considerable portion
«f the village, were for'several days
subjected to severe counter attacks be
fore the whole place fell before their
onslaught.
The German, general staff regarded
Fozieres of such importance that
they even brought reinforcements
from the Verdun sector.
By completing his occupation of Po
fcieres, Gen. Sir Douglas Haig has won
another vantage point in his offensive
along the Somme with Baupaume as
his objective. Part of the village lies
ton high ground commanding the main
toad from Albert to Baupaume along

evacuation of the. fortress of Erxingan
'by the Turks, according to unofficial
dispatches from Petrograd. Grand
Duke Nicholas has been converging
his forces on the city from three di
rections.
The Turks are said to be retiring in
.disorder, leaving quantities of guns,
[rifles and munitions in their trail.

be their new base, it is assumed by
military observers.

Norfolk, Va., July 26. —The ar
mored cruiser North Carolina
weighed anchor at Old Point at
1:30 p. m, and headed for the
capes. Two torpedo boat destroy
ers preceded the cruiser. It waa
•tated at Old Point that the three

the capes until further Instruc

Baltimore, Md., July 26. —-Ar
rangements to clear the German
merchant submarine Deutschland
were made late today by Capt.
Paul Koenlg, commander of the
vessel, who, It was said, personally
would go to the custom house af
ter regular hours to secure the
necessary papers.
Norfolk, Va., July 26.—The British
cruiser, which made a flying visit into
the waters of lower Chesapeake bay
during the early hours of Tuesday
morning and then slipped back to the
patrol line outside the three mile lim
it, still was unidentified today.
Officials here have made reports to
Washington and while none of them
believe the cruiser violated any pre
cepts of international law, all agree
it was a most unusual proceeding. Ob
viously the cruiser was looking foi
evidence of the Deutschland.
SUBMARINE IS TESTED.
BaJtimore, Md., July 26.—The Ger
man merchant submarine Deutschland
was given another submerging test at
her dock today. When she arose to
the surface ten minutes later her com
mander, Capt. Paul Koenig, and Con
structor William Prusse, expressed
satisfaction with the results.
Submergence was necessary to trim
her cargo properly.
Respecting a report that the Brem
en, hourly expected in American wat
ers, would go to Boston, it was said
at the offices of the Deutschland's
agents here today that the Bremen
would "seek shelter at the nearest,
safest and most convenient port on
the Atlantic seaboard."
CRUISE IS RESENTED.
Waahlngton, D. C., July 26.—Offici
als here, besides regarding the visit
of an unidentified British cruiser into
the lower Chesapeake at a time when
one German underwater liner is about
to start back to Germany and anoth
er is reported about to arrive, as very
unusual, are inclined to resent such
an incursion into American waters.
So far as is known the Norfolk in
cident is the first since the beginning
of the war in which an allied cruiser
had come into an American port. Ear

KAISER WILLIAM

REPORT FROM BERLIN SAYS
RULER IS STANDING WAR
RIGORS SPLENDIDLY.
Headquarters of the German Army
on the Somme. July 24 (By courier to
Berlin, July 25).—Bmperor William,
in his talk with the Saxon and Baden
military plenipotentiaries today, when
he described the impressions resulting
from his recent visit to the trenches,
punctuated and emphasized his dis
course with vigorous gestures. With
the freshness of his color and gen
eral vivacity of energy, his bearing
showed plainly that hia health had not
suffered under the long strain of the
war.
The emperor's departure for the
eastern front, accompanied by Gen.
Erich von Falkynhan. chief of the gen
eral staff, Immediately after the relig
ious service at army headquarters, is
taken as a sign that the responsible
heads of the army consider the situa
tion on the Somme now well in harfd
and that there is no occasion for ap
prehension.
The Associated Press correspondent
spent part of the morning at an ar
tillery observation station near Per
onne, waiting for the weather to clear
sufficiently to permit military opera
tions to begin. Noon, however, saw
no lift to the clouds, which hung low
until they joined hands with the fogs
from the Somme flats, and as there
was no prospect of witnessing any
thing interesting or important, the
watch was abandoned.

guardsmen with persons dependent up
on them now are pouring into army
headquarters at Ft. Sam Houston at
the rate of 1,500 a week, it waa an
nounced today. Several hundred al

WILSON DEFENDS SELF.
Washington, D. C., July 26. —In re
ply to a complaint from Mrs. Henry
Smith of Winamac, Ind., who has a
son in the national guard, President
Wilson wrote today that the guard was
being kept on the Mexican border to
protect the country, not for drill and
that the service the men were per
forming was an honor to them and a
necessity to the United States.
The president's letter was made pub
lic because many communications sim
ilar to that of Mrs. Smith are being re
ceived. The letter follows:
"Your letter of July 23 distresses me
a good deal because Jt shows that you
have not been correctly informed as to
the purpose of having the national
guard at the border. It is not for the
purpose of drill but for the purpose of
protecting the country. The service
the men are performing there is an
honor to them and a necessity to the
United States. I can not believe that
the men in the national guard would
wish to be excused from it or would
lose heart because of the discomforts
and inconveniences of the service.
"The war department has the camps
on the border under the most careful
inspection and is urging every means
known to make them sanitary and safe with the French government,
against disease. The health record of
the men on the border, both the regu
lars and the national guardsmen, is ex
ceptionally good.

HEAVY RAIN AT CAMP.
Brownsville, Tex., July 26.—Drain
age of the camp of the first Illinois
cavalry was so thorough that very
little water remained in the streets of
the cantonment today. The heavy rain
of yesterday flooded the camp and
Gen. Parker contemplated removing it
to another site. He changed his mind
this morning, however, when he saw
how thoroughly the water had been
carried off.
Illinois troopers declared that never
in the north had they seen such a
rain storm as deluged the camp yes

It occupied the bottom of a shallow

Washington, D. C., July 26.—Senate
leaders, encouraged today by President
Wilson's stand for the senate naval
program, were in high hopes that the
senate bill would suffer less at the
hands of a conference committee than
had been expected.
The house probably will name con
ferences when it meets again Thurs
day. Senate members have been
named. Representatives Buchanan, of
Illinois, fighting reference of the meas

that it is too important to be disposed
of that way, succeeded yesterday in
preventing naming of house confer

TDPRflTECTTHEM
RESOLUTIONS CALLING FOR AC-
TION BY THE GOVERNMENT,
TAKEN TO WASHINGTON.
New York, July 26.—Copies of reso
lutions calling upon the United States'
government to promptly bring about
the recall of commercial restrictions
placed upon American citizens by
Great Britain were sent today to mem
bers of the senate and house of rep
resentatives and governors of all the
states.
The resolutions were adopted by the
association to resist British domina
tion of American commerce, composed
of fifty or more representatives of
firms and individuals who have been
placed on the British trade blacklist.
Maurice B. Blumenthal, counsel for
the association, left for Washington
late last night carrying a copy of the
protest which he hopes to hand to
President WilBon today.
The preamble of the resolutions
says that the measures adopted by
Great Britain are intended "to com
pel American aid in destroying the
commerce of her adversaries regard
less of consequences to American
trade or rights."
It declares the facts upon which the
blacklisting was based were grained
by unlawful seizure, detention and ex
amination of American mails. Pear is
expressed that eventually Great Brit
ain may dominate the important com-,
merclal activities of the American
people. It is also stated that it is
manifested that Great Britain's trade
ships cannot be accorded the hospital
ity of American ports or negotiate
commercial affairs with any American
citizen or firm on these shores "or
elsewhere," so long as other citizens
are restricted in their rights of trade.
BRITAIN IN NO HURRY.
London, July 26.—Replying to the
request of Walter Hines Page, the
American ambassador, for expedition

weather bureau when at 10 o'clock the
season's highest mark for that hour in
the day. An increased humidity caus
ed much suffering. Officials stated
that there are no indications of an im

The records for this season were
broken yesterday when the thermom

Leaders said that little would be

ACTION OF BOARD IS

Supervisors Establish the
Highway Only After a
Lengthy Discussion
Opposition to the establishment of
the Ottumwa to Chlllicothe roadway
along the south side of the river threat
ens to appear in district court within
the next few days.
Indications are that protests against
the board of supervisors' action, in
establishing the highway Monday af
ternoon, will soon be made manifest
with the possibility of an injunction
suit being filed for trial.
Soon after the first petition was filed,
eighteen months ago, asking for the
establishment of the road, there were
several protests entered with the
board. These were gone over and a
number of hearings were held at which
those opposing the route and their
attorneys were present. A commis
sioner was appointed to survey the
route and after he had finished his
work a board of appraisers went over
the proposed roadway and assessed the
amount of damages which should be
allowed.
Two claims for damages had been
filed at that time with the auditor.
They were from Fred Hall and A1
Hammond and each one asked $750.
The appraisers decided that these two
property owners should be allowed $75
for each acre that was damaged by
the building of the road. The matter
was threshed out In a special meeting
of the board several weeks ago and
Monday afternoon, July 24, at 1:30
o'clock was set as the time for final
disposition of the matter. When that
meeting was called to order there was
not a property owner nor his attorney
there.
The supervisors, by unanimous vote,
ordered the road to be established with
certain conditions. The petitioners
are to have it in traveling condition
by October 1. They are to pay those
who filed claims for damages at the
rate of $75 an acre and they are to
bear the greater part of the expense
of the proceeding.

ELEVEN VICTIMS OF CLEVELAND
TUNNEL DISA8TER BURIED
UNDER LAKE MUD.
I
Cleveland, Ohio, July 26.—Rescue
forces went to waterworks crib No.
5, out in Lake Brie, this forenoon in
hopes of being able some time today
to penetrate the remote and wrecked
portion of the death tunnel where the
bodies of the unrecovered dead of
Monday night's disaster still remain.
Waterworks officials stated today
that they believe, there are eleven bod
ies still in the tunnel Instead of twelve
as previously estimated. They assert
that all of the dead of the rescue
forces which were wiped out striving
to save the workmen first trapped by
the explosions have been recovered
and that the corpses still in the tun
nel arc restricted to the eleven men,
including Assistant Supt. S. H. Vokes.
Should this prove true the.total death
toll is twenty-one instead of twenty
two.
Hope that the remaining dead may
be recovered within a few hours was
strengthened today when workmen
were able to replace the bullseye in
the air lock, broken yesterday to al
low the poisonous gaseB to escape
from the tunnel.
Workmen today said they would
never return to the work In the tun
nel. Once their dead comrades are
brought out they will quit, they say.
Only five city workmen of ninety who
have been employed at crib No. 5 were
on the soene' today. The workmen as
sert that the tunnel is a perpetual
peril.
The city's Investigation Into the dis
aster was under way today. It began
with a conference this morning of
Mayor Harry L. Davis, Law Director
W. S. Fitzgerald and Utilities Director
Thomas FarrelL They made up a'list
of witnesses to be called when public
hearings open later today.

QUESTION OF 8TRIKE WILL BE
LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THE
UNION OFFICIALS.
Chicago, July 26.—Leaders of the
four train service brotherhoods, com
prising more than 300,000 members,
may be empowered to call a general
strike, if reports concerning the vote
on the eight hour day and time and
a half for overtime propositions are
true. The vote will be completed to
day and it ifl said that confidential
advance reports from various sectlonB
of the country indicate an overwhelm
ing sentiment in favor of giving the
leaders this power.
The engineers, firemen, conductors
and trainmen are involved. In some
places, it is said, as high as ninety
per cent of the vote has been in favor
of authorizing the leaders to refuse
arbitration of the demands. The count
will be made in New York the fore
part of next month.
CAMP Dim DESERTED
All Iowa Militiamen Are at Border or

orderlies. All the Iowa troops have
gone to the Mexican border, the last
detachment leaving shortly after 7
o'clock yesterday.
It was stated today that although no
orders have been received, it waa

to take care of new enlistments, many
of which, it is believed, will come In
beginning about Friday.

to investigate the country's customs
laws, relations between the rates of
duty of raw materials and manufactur
ed products, effects of ad valorem and
specific duties, tariff relations between
the United States and foreign coun
tries, commercial treaties and foreign
competition.
