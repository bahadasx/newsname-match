Orleans Young Man Pound Dying in
His Carriage
INDICATIONS OF FOUL PLAY
Officials, Following Investigation, Say
That Death Could not Have Been
Accidental.
St. Johnsbury, July 26. Roy Wells
of Orleans, 21 years old, died this
morning at the St. Johnsbury hospital
of injuries believed to have resulted
from a murderous assault by an un
known person. The young man's
brothers believe that a rival for the
hand of an Irasburg girl is responsi
ble for the death Of Wells.
The victim was employed in a liv
ery stable at Orleans and Monday
night he drove to hashing to fall on
Miss Marie Ducharnie. He left about
midnight on the return trip to Or
leans and at 4 o'clock Tuesday morn
ing the young man was found by the
girls uncle, John Duchanne, who was
on his way to work, lying unconscious
in his carriage, his horse was grazing
by the roadside.
Wells had a bail wound on his fore
head and the carriage and ground
about were saturated with blood. Hi
was hurried io the St. Johnsbury bos
pital where he was attended by Dr. J.
M. Allen.
The injured man regained partial
consciousness for a few minutes and
muttered something about an accident
but officials who are conducting the
investigation slate that there could
nave been no accident and that the
young man was undoubtedly the vie
tint of an assault.
An autopsy was pcrlornicd this ev
ening by Dr. B, II. Stone of Hie state
laboratory of hygiene at Darlington.
Stales Attorney Aaron QfOUt of New
port being present.
Following the autopsy Mr. (lront

THE VERMONT TROOPS
Letter From the Chaplain, John
M,
Thomas.
Col. , L. Reeves has assigned me
the pleasant duty of sending a word
now and then to the home papers In
oiiler that the friends may have an
sfBciai word as to the health und
weiiaro or me men. i am giuu to re
port that thus lar the men are in ex
cellent spirus anu mere nave oeeu
no more cases of illness that would
be likely to occur among the same
nutnber of men at home. The only
illness at all serious has been that of
Private Vance Ricli of company F,
who is making a rapid and complete
recovery from an operation for ap
pendicitis. Aside from administra
tion of the typhoid prophylactic and
vaccination, the medical staff has
had little to do. One of the doctors
has suggested he might bring his
family heie as a desirable health re
sort. What little Illness we have had
has conic from drinking too much
pop'' and eating pies bought at the
exchanges and outside stands. Re
strictions were placed promptly upon
the sale of these articles, and the good
effect was noticed at once. The army
rations are clean, healthy, and abun
dant and both officers and men live as
well as they do at home.
It is natural for the boys to write
ICary letters aliout Hie terrible heasts
and fearful climate, but so far no one
has been wounded by a homed toad
nor has there been a single case of
heat rostration. The friends at
home BhOUld remember that Texas
has a considerable permanent iiopu-
Btion, many of them from the north,
and that they stay heie of their own
free Will and accord, because they like
the conditions. Frankly, I prefer
Vermont, but I haw to admit that I
live seen nothing in Texas ho disa
;reeable as the slush and mud of the
annual spring thaw in Vermont. We
have precisely the same conditions
here as abtain in other regions of tin
southwest where tuberculosis patients
are sent and which are found so faor
able for their recovery.
The first thought of Colunel Reeves
and his staff has been to conserve
the health of the men. and there hav
been no military exigencies to compel
hardships or privation. I trust, there
fore, that if any of the boys write
home In a way to stir anxiety, their
friends will remember that it is at
ways the temptation of the traveller to
magnify unfavorable comparisons
with heme conditions, nnd that they
will take some of the awe-inspiring
descriptions with a grain of salt. The
lms need home support, above all
frequent letters reminding them of
home obligations, but If such en
coiiraueinent does not fail, thev an
likely to come out of this expcrlelici
stronger and better men.

WILSON REPROVES MOTHER
Whs Complained Because Son
Was
Soldiering on the Border.
Washington, July 26. In reply to
a complaint from Mrs. Henry Smith of
Winamac, Intl., who has a son in the
National Guard, President Wilson
wrote today that the Guard being kept
on the Mexican border to protect tho
country, not for drill and that the ser-
lce the nun were performing was an
honor to them and a necessity to the
United States.
The President's letter was mado
public because' many communications
similar to that of Mrs. Smith are being
received, and tto answer criticisms
that the men of the National Guard
are not being properly cared for. The
letter follows.
"Your letter of July 23 distressed
me a good deal because It shows that
you have not been correctly informed
as to the purpose of having the Na
tional Guard at the border, it la not
for the purpose of drill, but for tho
purpose of protecting the country. The
senii e the men are performing there
Is an honor to them and a necessity to
the United. 1 cannot believe that the
men In the National Guard would wish
to be excused from It or would loso
heart because of the diseoinlorts and
Inconveniences oft he service.
"The war department has the
camps on the border under the most
careful Inspection and is using every
means to make them sanitary and
safe against disease. The health
record of the men on the border, both
the regulars and the National Guurds
men, Is exceptionally good.
"I would not have you think that
I do not sympathize with your dis
tress in the absence of your son. but
I beg that you will cake these larger
matters Into consideration."
