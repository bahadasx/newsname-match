This is Our Came
And the reason you should trade at the Pearl is because we
have the goods and want to sell them. We just simply put the price
to low that everybody can buy groceries. We get Cash for our
groceries and we don't have to make one man pay anothers bill, and
the way they do that is to charge a double profit and then if one man
beats his bill the other fellow has helped make that bill good, and
that is what you do when you trade on Time Get the habit take
money and buy where you can get the most for your money. That's
. where we step in, and if we can't give you more for your money we
don't want the money. We pay the highest price for butter, eggs,
chickens and all kinds of produce that is our game.

Proclamation.
By virtue of the authority in
me vested by law, I, A. B. Wil
lard, Mayor of Baxter Springs,
Kansts, do hereby order and pro
claim that a primary election
will be held in this city on Tues
day, August 1, 1916, in the var
ious wards of said city for the
purpose of selecting candidates
for the various offices to be voted
for at the general election in
November. 1916.
Judges and clerks and polling
places are hereby designated as
follows:
First Ward
Judges E. L. Wright, Jennie
L V. Brewster, w. T. Hope.
Clerks J. R. Dillinger, M. I.
Nichols.
Polling Place R. E. Rosen
stein's office.

In witness whereof I have here
unto set my hand and caused the
the seal of the city of Baxter
Springs to be affixed this 26th
day of July 1916.
A. B. Wiliaro, Mayor.
Attest: O. M. Spratt,
(seal) City Clerk.
Next Tuesday is primary day.
Don't forget to vote for Bob Fra-
zier tor toe Democratic nomina
tion for sheriff. Bob is teally
the man to vote for, if you are
tired of selecting fellows who
have nothing to do but run for
office. Bob is a man you will be
proud to support, and he is a man
who will appreciate your support.
He is a farmer, but he is one of
the prosperous kind. He is a
success, tie uvea in uoiumous a
couple of years, but that should
not count against him. At pres
ent be is living on his farm out
on Neosho river, where the latch
key is always on the outside if
vou want a place to picnic or fish.
He has more friends, perhaps,
than any other man in Cherokee
county, and we have no fears as
to his success in the primary
lection. And if be wins in the
primaries he is a sure winner in
the November elections, for there
are hundreds of people among
the Republicans who intend to
vote for him because of his num
erous good qualities. Don't for
get jolly Bob Frazier next Tues
day. Would it not be a good idea
for the board of heatlh to resign
and give way to one which will
have the nerve to compel a clean
up of the town? We think so.
The present board of .health is a
delusion and a snare. It might
lose a patient by making the
town and its people clean up
property. Such a board is of no
earthly account. The board may
claim to have plenty of nerve.
but if it has it is not along the i
line of making people clean up
their property. The right sort
of a board of bea'th would cause
every loud smelling closet in the
business part of town to be torn
down.
Mr. and Mrs J. G. Hicks, liv
ing on Route 2, were badly in-1
jured last Saturday evening.

wagon. Mr. Hicks was badly
bruised and Mrs. Hicks had a
shoulder dislocated and was also

M. I. U. road along the Main

To Our Readers.
This is the last issue of the
News under its present manage
ment. The new editor, Mr. A.
E. Pfremmer, of Hutchinson,
Kansas, will take charge on Sat
urday evening, July 29.
Mr. Pfremmer comes well rec
ommended, and we feel sure he
will give you a better peper, pos
sibly, than we have.
We give up the News for sev
eral reasous, the chief one of
which is this: The price of mat
erial has rone so high that a
paper cannot be printed profitably
at a dollar a year, and a rise in
price is going to be necessary.
We have seen all this coming on,
and did not have the heart to
make the increase in price. We
would prefer that a new man
make the change when it becomes
necessary.
We want to thank our friends
and patrons for the very liberal
patronage we have received, and
we want every one of them to
stand as loyally by the new man
as they hive by us.
We will continue to contribute
the brains we have to help make
the News a good paper under Mr.
Pfremmer s management. In
other words, we shall stand back
of him to help him over the rough
spots.
You need not be surprised if
the subscription price of the paper
is increased. Paper now costs
just three times as it did a year
ago. You will readily see the
necessity of an increase in price.
Fverything that goes into the
getting out of a newspaper has
also risen in price.
Hoping you will give Mr.
Pfremmer a very cordial recep
tion, we are
Yours very respectfully,

Why Leave It To
Chance?
You know something of the way in which
things left to chance usually work out You
know and appreciate the risk, the danger of
leaving the question of accumulation for future

Found Him Asleep
When burglars entered old Safety Stevens' house they
found him sound asleep. When his wife aroused him with
the whispered assertion that "there are burglars in the house,"
he replied with s yawn, "Let them go they can't find
anything. Our money is in the bank." He was that
worried. His pocketbook contained nothing but a bunch
of blank checks and a little loose change; nothing to lose.
It pays to have a bank accouut in a good reliable Dank for
the feeling of safety inspired, to say nothing of the many
conveniences and advantages.
