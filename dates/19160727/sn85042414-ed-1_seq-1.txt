UTTIE BLACK

Prospects Improve for Good
Wheat Crop in Mani
toba This Year.'
Winnipeg, Man. July 37.—Varying
reports of black rust continue to come
In here but these to a large extent
have been discounted and until It is
found in some new district the effect
will be rather mild. If the weather
shows any signs of Improving It 'will
take some pretty good buying to keep
wheat at its present price..
There, is no serious sign'of black
rust in the Canadian crop yet and
with the present weather there is'lit
tle chance of developing. The-weath
er is Ideal for filling while the -cool
ness and the nioe-breese should blow
away the rust scare.
There Is a big- short interest in the
Winnipeg market, hpfreyejr, which
must also be taken Into aocoun't It
Is a market wbl/sh could easily be
pushed two or three cents either way
wt will take real damage to arouse
bullish sentiment similar to that of
ten days ago
All the exports are doing at pres
ent la to take-a very smalt supply of
cash wheat. As the big prices and
the approach of the harvest tends to
bring out the old wheat the offerings
in the cash -market are heavy -and the
premiums none too firm.
