CLEVELAND TUNNEL

Explosion Believed to Have Opened
Natural Gas Pocket Which Will Ne

doned—Bodies Can Not Be Reached.
Cleveland, July 27.—'Indications that
a well of* natural gas was uncovered by
the tunnel explosion here last Monday
were reported today by L. M. Jones, the
government mining expert sent here
from Pittsburgh.
The flow of gas not only makes re
covery of the bodies in the wreck im
possible but may prevent completion of
the tunnel itself, Mr. Jones said.
The gas well, according to the ex
pert, is apparently of uncontrollable
proportions and the gas similar to that
at the suburb of Lakewood.
Despite this development, prepara
tions for further exploration were made
today, hTe bodies lie behied a cave-in
nearly 300 feet long.
Special machinery will be needed to
penetrate this wall of muck. It will
require several days to install it if gas
clears from the workings. It will then
require several days digging to reach
the corpses, so in any event no more
bodies aire expected to be found for a
week or more,
Waiter works officials said today they
believe tibere are only nine bodies- in the
tunnel insittd'Of nlaveiHi''4» previously
esttonatfri. Patrick Beams, supposed
to be entombed, turned up alive today.
He had overstayed shore leave Monday
and missed death by a narrow margin.
Justice Arro, another thought to be in
the tunnel, has also been reported alive..
This reduces the total loss of life to
nineteen.
The city investigation reached exam
ination of witnesses today.
