Pewell Man Sells a Good Thing.

Kentucky Silo Co., Stanford, is

doubt of the value of a silo, and,
after learning of the advantages
of the Kentucky, we, have no
doubt of its superiority over all
others. We are going to put up
one on our place next year, and
it is going to be one like Mr.
Kincaid sells.

been appointed Game Warden
for the 26th district, composing
the five counties, viz: Rowan
Bath, Montgomery, Powell and
Menefee. The duties of this office
will call Mr. Orabtree frequent
ly into these counties, and their
people will find him an officer
just fitted for the place.

ea of "Warning and Reward"
which outlines the new fish and
game.kws, extracts of which will
be given in these columns from
time to time as the law fits the
different passing seasons. We
advise no one taking down his

read and re-read the new game
laws
Damaged by Fire.
The kitchen attached to- the
home of Jesse Eaton in the west
em portion of the city took fire
Sunday afternoon and it was with
great difficulty that tho flames
were extinguished after the
kitchen had been burned. The
saving of the main building was
a marvel, and called forth heroic
work on the part of the bucket
brigade which always has done
wonders in Clay Uity.
To Fire the First Gun
ine state democratic cam
paign will be launched at Win-
uiicoici, unu wiucnesier is con
gratulating herself upon secur
ing this event. This will give
Powell county people an oppor
tunity to hear the big guns open
the battle) and it tis, useless to
say that the keen interest of the
Powell politicians will provoke a
largo attendance at this big
Democratic meeting.

The Boosters of Winchester
The 8: 20 train Tuesday morn
ing brought forth to Clay City
an aggregation of business men
from Winchester that seemed to
be the most pleasant and liberal
bunch that ever hit the burg.
They fairly loaded us down witli
souvenirs of value, and their
good cheer. They seemed to be
out for a good time socially rath
er than to boost their business
and the Clark County Fair
which came up the next day af
ter they wero here.
The boys didn't stay long and
it was a moment of regret when
they left, taking with them
their Royal Scotch Highlander's
Band, which, as an intermission
of the excellent playing of our
own Concert Band, was much en
joyed, as well as the agreeable
mingling with the affable boost
ers.
The relationship between Clay
City and Winchester has thus
been tightened up one more link,
account their coming to see us.
Wo are often down to Winches

acquainted by their coming more
our way, and our latch string
still hangs out with the string
considerably stretched because
of their visit to us Tuesday.
