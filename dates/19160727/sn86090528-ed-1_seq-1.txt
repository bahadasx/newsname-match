County Judge's Statement Explains Why
No Warrants for Conspiracy in
Fight Affair Was Issued
STATUTE APPLYING
TO CASE IS. QUOTED
Declares' Bout Advertised as Boxing Co
test, Leaving No Ground for Legal
Action Required by Yenable
(By R. E. Davenport.)
In the Daily Express of date July
yh, there appears a (our article by
Mr. Venable, at least the whole article
Is in quotation and from its appear
unco is quoted verbatim and appears
to have been prepared by Mr, Vena
hie. H has been my practice to try
law-suits in the court house and not in
Ihe daily papers. I have never desired
to rush into print, but alter reading
.Mr. Venable's statement, I feel that it
is due the county judge's office to
make a statement about the matter.
When the prize fights or boxing
matches were first started in Chick
asha, and after one of these bouts had
been pulled off, I went to the sheriff
and told him from what I had heard
(hat they bad violated the law and
suggested the next time they had one
that it would be a good idea to be
present and if they violated the law to
arrest them. I am informed by the
sheriff that he went to the county at
torney In the matter and did not get
very much satisfaction. That ho went
back to him the second time and was
not given orders to act. One day last
week Mr. Venable applied to the dis
trict, court for an injunction, . which
was refused. The paper states he ap
plied to the governor to stop the fight,
and he declined. On Monday nlorning
he asked me if I would be at home
Tuesday night and said he wanted war
rants for the prize-fighters. I was
needed in other parts of the county
about my campaign, but I came back
to be here to issue the warrants. When
I got in Tuesday evening, that was the
first time lie said anything to me
about issuing warrants for a conspira
cy. Article 5C2fl of Revised Statute. f
1910, being the Statutes now used,
vides "When a complaint verified by
, oath or information is laid before a
magistrate for the commission of a
public offense HE MUST IF SATIS
FIED THEREFROM THAT THE OF
FENSE COMPLAINED OF HAS
BEEN COMMITTED AND THAT
THERE IS REASONABLE GROUNDS
TO BELIEVK THAT THE DEFEND
ANT HAS COMMITTED IT to issue a
warrant of arrest."
The information' stated among other
things that the parties against whom
the warrants were asked "Have adver
tised the prize fight and sold tickets
for admission." At the time Mr. Ven
able presented this information to me
which he had prepared. I told him that
I had understood he wanted a warrant
against the parties engaged in the
prize fight, and that I had come back
to be ready to issue the warrants and
would issue them after they had start
ed to fight. Mr. Venable as I under
stand, agreed with me that a warrant
could not be issued, charging them
with engaging in a prize fight on the
ground that they were going to fight.
When I read the information I had
seen some of the advertising, and the
advertisement I had seen, advertised
a boxing contest, so I went to the Owl
drug store where the tickets were on
sale, on the front window I found a
large placard which read. "JIM
FLVNNl TEXAS TATE, BOXING EX
HIBITION, TICKETS FOR SALE
HERE." After examining this card
and reading such other advertisements
of it as I could find, I hurriedly looked
up the law and came to the conclusion
that I had no right to Issue a warrant
where I was put on notice that the
facts stated in the information were
not correct, and I came to the conclu
sion that they had advertised a boxing
contest and not a prize fight. It was
not a matter with me of what they
were going to do but a matter of what
they had advertised. I thought that
Sluy had advertised a boxing contest
and wanted to pull off a prize fight.

BOY HAS
NARROW
ESCAPE
Painfully Injured by Being Struck by
Auto While Alighting From Wrong
Side of Street Car Today
The dangerous practice of swinging
off a car while it is in motion very
nearly proved fatal to Ben Knowles,
a machinist at Boone & Rickerts' gar
age, when he dropped from the 7:45
street ca'r between Fourth and Fifth
streets this morning and was run over
by a pnssing automobile.
According to onlookers, Knowles
swung from the car as it was going
east at a fair speed, and was on the
wrong side of the car from which the
passengers usually alight. Ho did not
notice the. oncoming automobile head
ed west, and the general opinion of the
witnesses is that the accident was un
avoidable. Knowles was knocked
dqwn and the car passed entirely over
him. Both bones in his right arm
above the wrist were broken, his back
and right leg were bruised, and he re
ceived minor scratches and cuts on
his head. He was taken immediately
to the Chickasha hospital where he is
reported to bo resting easily this af
ternoon. Officers Wyatt and Looney, who are
in charge of the. county road gang,
were in the car with several prisoners
whom they were taking to the coun
try. Although there is some difference
of opinion as to how fast the auto
was going one party present says the
tact that the car stopped in a few
feet after running over the boy was
proof that it was not speeding.
RAILROAD
CONTRACT
AID TO CITY
In the event of the city of Chickasha
closing a contract with the Rock Is
land road to supply the railroad ail of
the water used at this point and do
ing away with the Rock Island plant,
it will put the water works system in
a good financial condition. The con
tract, it is estimated, will furnish ad
ditional revenue of about $5,000 per
year exclusive of the sums now being
paid. This will reduce the expense
to the city of maintaining the water
works system almost one-half.
After the interest and sinking fund
demands on the water works bonds
were satisfied last year there, remain
ed a balance of 12'M to be applied on
operating expenses, which totalled $12.
S50. Employing the same basis for
this year's operating expenses the net
revenue from the railroad exclusive
of the added expense of a second en
gineer, added to the additional revenue
derived during the summer months
from watering the lawns of the city
would make a great difference in the
amount to be made up out of the city
fund for the maintenance of the sys

PERSISTENT THAN MEN
Hy United Press.
Denver, Colo., July 27. Drunken
ness among women has been slower to
decrease, under the state prohibition
law than among men, juvenile court
authorities said here tod?" ;
Prohibition has cut down the num
ber of cases before the various city
courts. 75 per cent. Habitual men
drunkards have almost disappeared.
While drinking by women show., a
marked decrease the ;-rcentage of
habitual "woman drunks" who have
reformed falls much below that of the
men.
Juvenile court officer John Phillips,
who meets these cases because chil
dren generally suffer when their pa
rents get drunk, said women become
liquor victims through environment,
despondency and out of revenge.
"Once a woman Is cursed with this
habit," said Phillips, "her downfall is
much faster than a man's because of
her frailer makeup. Women edicted
to both the liquor ai.d tobacco habits,
it Is almost impossible to cure."
