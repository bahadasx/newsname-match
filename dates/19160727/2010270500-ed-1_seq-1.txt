. Horace in the Sand Hills
Alfalfa can be grown in' most sec
tions of the sand hills country, ac
cording to work done at the Valen
tine substation, and it is recommend
ed that wherq possible it should be
made to take the place of intertilled
forage crops, because ,it would do
away with the danger of soil blowing.
It is also of more value than any
other forage crop that can he grown.
Experiments have shown that for
that section of country alfalfa ex
ceeds all clovers, including sweet
clover, in its adaptability to the con
ditions found there, and that it is
more valuable than any of them and
costs less to seed.
Sweet clover has been found more
adapted to hard pan lands than to
sand hills lands.
A! '.. and ved clover, especially
the fi n i-r, are well adapted to wet
valley meadow conditions, and when
sown in with native grasses are
valuable for increasing the protein
element in native hay.
Slender wheat, brome, and west
ern wheat grasses are the only grass
es that succeed in making stands
under dry soil conditions on cultivat
ed ground at the substation. None
of them made much hay, and it is
questionable if it is profitable to at
tempt grass growing on any but wet

Kaclpe for Canning Corn
Sweet corn should be canned the
same day that it is picked. After
removing the husk and silk, blanch
the corn (before cutting from the
cob) in boiling water from 5 to 15
minutes. Blanching is done by
placing the corn in a wire basket or
cheesecloth and plunging into hot
water, or better still by steaming
the corn. Blanching will make the
texture more firm. Next plunge
the corn quickly into cold water.
Then cut the corn from the cob and
pack tightly in jars until full. Add
a level teaspoonful of salt to each
quart and sufficient hot water to fill
all crevices. Then put on the rub
bers and tops and partially tighten
the tops. Place the jars in a large
wash boiler or kettle containing a
false bottom. The water should
come over the tops of the jars. Boil
three hours. The false bottom may
consist of wooden slnta or any suita
ble material which will prevent the
jars from coming in direct contact
with the heated metal. After boil
ing, allow the water to cool partially,
remove from the bath, tighten the
lids, and invert to cool. If the wash
boiler method is not used, boil 90
minutes in a water-seal outfit, GO
minutes under 5 pounds of steam,
or 35 minutes under 20 pounds of
steam. Department of Home Econ
omics, University of Nebraska.
CareofTlies
Buy a tire tester. It will cost
about $1.
To prevent rim cutting and broken
down fabric, keep tires inflated to
the following presure: 3 inch tire,
GO pounds; 3J inch, 70 pounds; !
inch, 80 pounds; 43 Inch, 90 pounds;
5 Inch, 100 pounds.
Seal all cuts in rubber either with
tire dough or by vulcanization.
This is important to prevent moist
ure and sand from reaching the
fabric.
When not in use keep tires in a,
cool dark place.
Do not start or stop the car sud
denly. Do not turn corners at a high rate
of speed.
Bo sure the front wheels are par
allel. Do not allow oil to p.c on the
tires. '
Do not use too much or too little
talc in the tires. Too little causes
the tubes to stick while too much
causes a gradual accumulation into
a solid lump which is a frequent
cause of t puncture.
Do not put a tire on a rusted rim.
