SAN FRANCISCO, July 27. Thoa.
H. Turnbull, the ninth victim of ttie
dynamite outrage, died lam night.
The bomb wan made of a sect Ion of
wrought Iron aland pipe, our inches
In Inside diameter and about twelve
Inches long. It wan capped with
heavy wroiiKhl iron caps screwed on
each end. Krom a plumber- shop
dipt. Matheson obtained a section of
uch pipe and a cap that exactly
matched the iron fragments of the
bomb recovered after the explosion.
The screw threads on the pieces of
the cap used In the bomb fitted the
crew threads on the new pipe sec
tion. One of Ihe fragments of pipe shows
the hole through which the wires led
from the clock outside to the fulmi
nating cap next the explosive. This
waa fitted with a brass nipple on
which was screwed an Iron nut. A
double strip or thin brass found
among the fragments was evidently
the contact which made the connec
tion with the battery when released
by the alarm mechanism of the clock.
No portions of a clock have been
found, but the experts give It as their
opinion that everything Indicates that
one was used.
Ordinary gelatine dynamite was the
explosive used, according to Arthur
Crane, the Hercule'B expert. Basing
his opinion on an examination of the
effects of the explosion on the aide
walk and wall on Hteuart street and
on tlie fragments of the bomb, Crane
declared that this was undoubtedly
the powder used.
As an added reason for his belief,
Crane said that gelatine dynamite Is
the commonest form of high explo
sive and therefore the most easily
obtained. Other forms of high ex
plosive, particularly those Involving
much chemical manipulation, are not
easily made nor easily obtained.
Furthermore, said Crane, gelatine dy
namlte gives off a light smoke that
disperses quickly, as was the case
Saturday.
About three pounds of gelatine dv
namile were used as the charge,
according to Crane. He also said,
tfter Inspecting the wall and side
walk, that the bomb was Btandlng on
one end when It exploded. The car
tridges and metal Junk that, with
the fragments of the bursted pipe,
formed the deadly missies' of the
bomb, were not loaded into the Iron
case, but were packed around it in
the suitcase In which it was contained.

WASHINGTON, July 27. For the past three days it has been
reported that a British warship has been cruising within the three
mile limit in Chesapeake bay and the question has been raised as
td the rights, of any belligerent to come within the statutory distance
during hostilities. The State department says there is no law against
the cruising close in shore so long -as the stay of the vessel does not
extend beyond twenty-four hours. All war vessels are at liberty
to come and go within that period, but advantage is not taken of
the privilege as it might be used to prevent the ship from entering
port later on.
This morning the British ambassador told Assistant Secretary of
State Polk that he had a message from the admiral of the British
fleet denying that any vessel under his command had gone inside
Chesapeake bay. A cablegram from London said no information
had been received regarding the reported mysterious visit Monday
night of a British cruiser within American territorial water of the
Virginia capes. t
