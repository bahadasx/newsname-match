No knife can cut our love in two."
On the French front only one sur
vivor of 32 Germans was found in a
portion of one of the trenches cap
tured. The survivor said that after
more than half of the men were kill
ed, the lieutenant became insane and
killed the wounded and unwounded
survivors with his revolver. The last
man, a Bavarian, escaped from the
trench and was shot down and died
soon after his capture by the French.
Lieutenant Marchal, of the French
aviator corps, last month left French
soil and flew over the German capi
tal, upon which he dropped proclam
ations and then continued his flight,
intending to land within the Russian
lines. He was forced to descend,
however, in Poland and was taken
prisoner by the Germans. The pro
clamations dropped by Lieutenant
Marchal on Berlin stated that though
it was possible, the aviator refrained
from bombarding the open town and
"thus kill the women and innocent
children." Lieutenant Marchal made
a continuous flight of about 807 miles,
most of which he traveled in dark
ness. ANOTHER ARMY

handsomely dressed stranger, claim

NEGRO FARM
" AGENT HERE
Announcement Made by the
Agricultural Depart
ment. W. T. Fowler, president of the
Christian County Crop Improvement
Association, announced Tuesday that
a negro farm agent had been granted
to Christian county. Mr. Fowler had
conferred with Dr. Fred Mtitchlcr,
chief of the farm extension work in
the state, while Dr. Mutchlcr was in
Hopkinsvillo Monday at a gathering
of the state farm agents at Hotel
Latham. Mr. Fowler made the state
ment that the negro agent would be
employed by the county upon the
official advice of Dr. Mutchler.
The securing of a negro agent for
this county comes alter a hard effort
by the Crop Improvement Associa
tion. The exact arrangements be
tween the government and the farm
ers of the county by which the salary
of the new agent will be paid, have
not been delineated. The county will
be called upon to co-operate with the
government in this regard.
A farm colored agent has been
badly needed by Christian county for
several years. With 873 negroes
owning their own farms and many
others working on a share basis, there
is a wide field of work opened which
the regular county agent could hardly
attend to in connection with his other
duties. Christian county has nearly
twice as many negro farm owners
and operators as any other county in
Kentucky.
The agent is expected to he chosen
cither from Hampton College or
Tuskogec Institute, the two largest
negro schools in the South.
DR. WHITE FOUND BLEEDING.
Sing Sing, N. Y.. July 2G. -Dr. Ar
thur Warren Waite, awaiting electro
cution here for the murder of his
father-in-law, John E. Peck of Grand
Rapids, Mich., was found in his cell
in the death house last night bleeding
from a wound in his chest, made in
the shape of a crass. The prisoner
had cut himself with a piece of broken
glass.
How Waite had obtained possession
of the glass could not be explained.
It is presumed while exercising in the
court yard he picked it up when the
vigilance of his guard Avas relaxed
and concealed it until he returned to
the prison hospital but he steadfastly
refused, to answer questions. Tlyj
prison authorities believe if he had
intended to kill himself, he "would
have inflicted the wound elsewhere
than on his chest. The injury is not
serious.
PROSPECTS BRIGHT.

ALLIES PUSH
THE FIGHTING
Gen. Haig's Forces Hold Hard
Won Position at Village
of Poziers.
CROSS THE SLONVEKE
Turkish Forces Arc Fleeing
Before Strong Russian Ad
vance in Central Armenia.
London, July 26. Fierce fighting is
still going on between the British and
Germans in the Somme region of
France; the men in the endeavors to
press forward or to hold back attacks
frequently engage in hand to hand
combats.
The British are tenaciously holding
to the portions of the village of Poiz
cres from which they drove the Ger
mans and with their artillery fire have
repulsed there an attempt by the Ger
man infantry to regain possession of
the northeastern portion of the vil
lage.
Calm has prevailed on the French
section of the front in the Somme re
gion. The Russians continue to make
progress against the Teutonic allies in
the Volhynian district, sending their
troops across the Slonveke river, not
withstanding the fire of the Teutons.
One thousand prisoners and four can
non and five machine guns, which
were later used against the Austrians
and Germans were taken in this re
gion by the Russians.
Berlin admits the penetration by the
Russians of part of Gen. von Linsen
gen's first line trenches in Volhynia.
The drive against the Turks in Ar
menia is still going on and, with the
Russian at their heels, the Turks are
fleeing,' leaving guns and munitions.
The Russians have thrown their ad
vanced guards to within ten miles of
Erzeringen in central Armenia and
the Turks arc there declared unoffici
ally to be preparing to withdraw from
this front to a new base at Sivas, 130
Imiles to the west.
In the Austro-Italian zone, the Itali
ans report the capture by their troops
of Monte Cimone, in the Posina-Asti-co
sector; a further advance in the
Monte Chiesa region, and the repulse
of counter-attacks on trenches they
had captured near Sasera and Zcbro
on the Asiago plateau.
Ode to Kentucky.
Mrs. Lily Waller Chatten, a native
of Kentucky, who spends a portion of
her time in Knoxvillc, where she has
many friends, gave an original poem
on Kentucky at the Fourth of July cel
ebration at the summer school. Mrs.
Chatten is a reader, entertainer and
author of "Pennyroyal Pearls" and
other poems. She read the following:
! I'm longing for Kentucky,
j Now that the spring is here,
, Where the bluebird and the robin
Sing again their merry cheer.
Where perched on hedge and dog
wood, j In coat of flaming ray,
, King Cardinal sits on topmost bough
j And trills his rapturous lay.
Whero tiny leaves have broadened
Into palms that stretch and give
New life and joy and happiness,
i And made us glad to live.
I Oh, dear, dear old Kontucky,
I With turf of emerald groon,
j With your clover fields and daisies,
And quiet rills between.
No sky so blue in Heavon,
No stars so sparkling bright,
No moon o'er told sucli secrets
To lovers night by night.
I'm longing for Kentucky,
Now that tho spring is hero
For Kentucky, old Kentucky,
The place on earth most dear.
j Campbell Still Alive
B. E. Choate, who mutilated Henry
Campbell at Wingo, Ky., executed
bond and lias disappeared. Campbell
is still alive.
REV. BURROUGHS
OF BRISTOL DEAD
Famous Marrying Parson
Ends Remarkable
Career.
Bristol, Va.-Tcnn., July 27. The
Rev. Alfred Harrison Burroughs, the
"Marrying Parson" of Bristol, isdend
at the ago of eighty-three years. Par
son Burroughs resigned from the
ministry twenty-five years ago in ord
er to establish what is probably the
most famous marrying mccca in the
United btates. He claimed to have
united more love-lorn lads and lasses
than any other man in the world. He
built and equipped a hotel for the ex
clusive use of runaway couples the
only hostelry of its kind in existence.
At the time of his death he had per
formed the marriage ceremony for
5,142 couples.
The hotel of which he was proprie
tor is probably the most unique hotel
in the world. It was designed and
erected expressly for the convenience
of eloping couples. Every room in it
is a bridal chamber. It is situated
squarely upon the dividing line be
tween Virginia and Tennessee. The
stratetic location of the house, one-
half which lies in one statcland the
other half in a neighboring state, is at
once apparent for the execution of the
purposes for which it was built.
Elopers from one state have only to
cross the hall to be within the juris
diction of the adjoining state. Scarce
ly a day passed that Parson Bur
roughs was not called upon to enter
tain one or more eloping couples.
SEIIGT. GARBER
Has Busy Day in Recruiting
Soldiers For the Army.

product, is a persistent patriot. Al
though rejected from Company D
he had no sooner returned from Fort
Thomas than he put in his appearance
at Sergt. George Garber's headquar
ters and asked to be taken into the
regular army. It was found that his
vision and hearing were defective.
He left asking the Sergeant to try to
get tho war department to make an j
exception of him, but this is impossi
ble. Irvie McCaslin and Arthur
Lowry, of Princeton, and Bennie
Wilson, of this county, arc applicants
for enlistment and are awaiting a tel
egram from Washington stating
whether they will be received. They
are all under weight.
