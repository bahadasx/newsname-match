"My,
This is the exclamation with which Dr. Lamar ex
presses his surprise at the foolish excuses of people for
their useless and sinful lives.
There Is pity and love in his tone. And it is glorious
to see the great overflowing tent-full of people listening
to eagerly to his faithful and persuasive words.
This meeting is bringing neighbors together. Young
and old alike are interested. The children we had not
seen for some time have been growing up, and there are
new babies in carts and laps. If religion is love and
good-will we are having a revival.
And if a revival means a renewal of interest, and
hope, and fresh resolves, and new beginnings of right liv
ing, we are having one. The truth and the spirit are at
work. The Kingdom of God has come nigh unto us.
But there are faces and voices that we strangely miss.
There are church members and church officers that for
some reason do not " show up ". And some, who certainly
, have the same need of such revival as the rest of us, stay
away. And the meeting will end up on Saturday. My,
Mel

Government Want Great Britain te
Respond te Charges That Corre
spondence la Under Cenventlenal
Stipulation Inviolable.
Washington, July IB. Tbe state de
partment baa Informed the British
government that its memorandum on
mails was wholly unsatisfactory to
the United States In meeting the Is
sue raised over Interference with the
malls.
In acknowledging receipt of the
memorandum cabled from London,
the state department again served no
tice on Great Britain that It still
awaited a reply to Its note of Way 24,
which has. gone unanswered for two
months.
The memorandum, which was given
to the press by the state department,
la considered aa wholly evading the
principle Involved. The memorandum
confines Itself almost exclusively to
discussion of two speciflo Instances,
defends the censors for expediting
their work of espionage, and adds
that the British government "will al
ways be ready to explain In detail tbe
workings of the censorship."
State department officials declare
they do not need any explanation of
tha workings of the censorship. They
have had sufficient complaints from
American firms whose confidential let
ters were rifled of their contents, to
know all they want to know about the
activities of the censors.
What the United Steles govern
ment wants Great Britain to do Is to
respond to the American contention
"that genuine correspondence Is un
der conventional stipulation Inviol
able." The memorandum mad public was
accepted as forecaat'ng a fiat denial
of American demands In the forth
coming reply to the note- of. two
months afro. In response to a request
made several days ago for an Imme
diate reply Ireat Britain explains that
her reply Is withheld pending consul
tation with her allies. In her last
communication Great Britain brought
France Into the case, although tha
United States has no quarrel with
France whatever over tbe malls.
Officials realize, however, that the
United States cannot act with finality
ao long as the British government
evades the issue, and for that reason
every effort will be made to force that
government to make speciflo reply te
the principle Involved.
