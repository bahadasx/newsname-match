Nor was there competition lack

judges were hard put at times

MEMOIR
James Whiteomb Riley, the Hoosier Poet, is
dead, and a pall of sadness falls over those count
less thousands who havh loved him and his sweet
songs. But what a glorious memory is left be
hind, the memory of a good man, and in his own
words—
"A good man never dies
In worthy deed and prayer
And helpful hands, and honest eyes
11 smiles and tears be there:
Who lives lor you and me—
Lives Jor the world he tries
To help—he lives eternally.
A good man never dies
"Wlio llvc-s to bravely take
Mis share of toll and stress,
And, for his weaker fellows' sake
Makes every burden less,—
lie may, at last, seem worn
Lie fallen—hands and eyes
Folded—yet, tho' we mourn and mourn,
A good man never dies."
Of late years his health has not been good and
he has been obliged to forego the pleasures of
mixing with the people whom he loved. He felt
that the time of his departure was not far off
when he wrote "A Parting Guest"—
"What delightful hosts are they—
Life and Love!
Llneertngly I turn away,
This late hours, yet glad enough
They have not withheld from me
Their high hospitality.
So, with face lit with delight
And all gratitude, I stay
Yet to press their hands and say,
"l'hanks.—So fine a time! Good night.'

Most of tin.' crowd stayed for
the evening program which end
ed up with a llight by Miss Ruth
Law in her biplane and the dis
play of fireworks, one of the
big features of which was a set
piece showing in characters of
fire the words "Welcome to
Steele County".
There is no question that the
trip to "put Steele. County 011
the map" and its success is due
to the untiring efforts of Better
Farming Agent A. E Nelson.

Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles
what he needed in an automobile.
If an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring when the frost is coming out of the ground
and the rnud is so deep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs and be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
farmer's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in the reach of every business farmer. Its light
weight insures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appearance the Dort merits a careful investi
gation of the Business Farmer.
