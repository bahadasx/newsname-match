FORESTS OF FLORIDA
Larger Area than in Any Other
State in the Union
TROPICAL SPECIES ABOUND
. Interesting Conclusions as to the
Probable Duration and
Propects .
Roland M. Harper, formerly
connected with the State Goo
logical Survey, has published two
studies of the arboreal resources
of Florida and Georgia, respec
tively, which are doubly inter
1 esting by reason of a sort of cen
sus of the forests of those states
and for the conclusions he draws
from observation. The census is
in the form of percentages which
the different species of tree bear
to the main standard of timber
of the state, as gathered from var
. ious sources, supplemented by the
author's field work in nearly ev
ery county in Florida. The conclu
sion he draws from observations
differ radically from those of
some other writers on the subject
as relates to the existence of the
forests. ' ' '
Florida, he says, has probably
'a larger area of forest at the pre
sent time than any other state in
, the Union, about 27,000,000 acres,
of which 17,659,000 were owned
and controlled by lumbermen on
January 11, 1911, according to the
latest authoritative report. From
this the author figures out a total
stand of timber in this state at
that date of 108,000,000,000 feet.
This state has also considerably
more species of trees than any
other state in the Union, a con
servative estimate being 200.
Nearly half, however, are tropical
species, confined to a limited area
of South Florida.
As to the probable duration of
Florida forests his conclusions
are interesting. Fires, in his o
pinion, are not so destructive to
Florida' forests as they are to
..those of the Northwest. or North.
The recuperative-powers of our
climate, the greater length of our
growing season, make fire losses
less severe in their ultimate
, effects. The increase in the area
; under cultivation he finds the
most threatening factor in the
problem of the perpetuity of our
forests, but complete exhaustion
of our timber by this j means is
probably several centuries off, in
Mr. Harper's opinion. Long-leaf
pine is be!ng,cut faster than it
grows, but he doubts even wheth
or this species is being exhausted
so rapidly as -vas formerly sup"
posed. The future prospects of
our forests are thus summed up
m the conclusion of this paper:
"In fact, wherever the lumber,
turpentine and phosphate men
have done their worst and depart
ed to new fields tho pines begin to
grow again unless the farmer
comes immediately after.for there
.are hardly enough people in Flor
ida yet to keep the forests down
tuven wtien the population is
much 'denser than it is now the
rate of cutting may not be increas
ed, for we now have substitutes
for wood in almost every industry
in which it is used, and tho use of
these substitutes is constantly in
creasing, so much that the manu
facturers of long-leaf pine and cy
press lumber m the last tew years
have tried to stem the tide by ad
vertisbig their products in news
papers and magazines. Long be
fore our forests are' replaced by
cultivated fields we will probably
learn to dispense with wood al
most entirely, as the Eskimos.Thi
betaus, Turks, Spaniards, Mexi
cans and other people living
where trees are scarce do now,
find the remaining forests will be
valued chiefly for their beauty
and their influence on climate,
stream flow, etc.
Even our fires, the author ob
serves, "sweep over any one spot
about once in two years and tend
to keep down underbrush but do
no harm to mature and sound
pines." A new crop is continually
springing up from the seed and
the young pine grows so fast that
many of them are soon beyond
the reach of harm. We are giving
our understanding of the author's
arguments in this, not quoting his
words.
The author insists, in the oth

er article referred to, that the
Georgia forests are also reproduc
ing themselves faster than the su
perficial observer is inclined to be
lieve, and that there is no immed
iate danger of a timber famine in
rthat state.
The address of Chief Forester
Graves before the Southern For
estry Congress at Asheville, and
outline of which was given in
Tuesday's issue, should be read in
connection with the reassuring
words of Mr. Harper. If forest
conservation goes hand in hand
vith forest destruction from ac
cident and the inroads of the in
dustries, our forests might as well
be perpetual, except as the needs
of room for agricultural expan
sion might . interfere. Florida

A Cuban View
They are having a terrible tima
over in Florida over the nomina
tion for governor A preacher
named Catts announced himself a
candidate and gum-shoed it about
over the state, not being taken at
all seriously by the three or four
other eandidates. He took to the
by-ways and cow-paths, and told
those country Crackers how the
Vatican was about to move from
Rome and move right over there
to Florida and run things with its
Swiss guard to suit itself. No Ro
man domination for them.' They
had no idea of what Roman
domination was, but they would
not have it,' and the morning af
ter the primaries came with Can
idate Preacher Catts with a plu
rality of a hundred or so. The
rest of the candidates did not re
alize how dangerous the Pope and
his church were, way off in Italy,
and now they arc studying a way
out of the predicament. A state
which got rid of carpet-baggers,
the negro vote and converted
soldiers into good old democrats,
should not be puzzled over this
little matter. Havana Evening
News.
State Division
The sentiment for state division
is growing fast and in all prob
ability the coming legislature wi'J
have the subject to deal with.
There isn't a real argument a
gainst it, but there are many fa
vorable to it. As the matter now
stands the situation is just about
as inconvenient as could possibly
be. People from this section of the
state having business in the capi
tal city are compelled to waste
practically a week getting there
and back.Conditions in West and
and South Florida are as differ
ent, almost, . as between South
Florida and Kentucky. Legisla
tion needed in one section is of
slight interest to the other. Ther?
are dozens of reasons why?-;, both
sections would bs henfited byMi
yirjon. So why not turn'tlid trick
in the next legislature and havojjj
over with. It's coming in the
near future, anyway.
If Tallahassse wants to remain
the Capital city of some state, it
had better get into the band wag
on and boost for state division.
Then it could still be the capital
of West Florida, or North Flori
da, or whatever they choose to call
the other state. But if it contin
ues to fight state division it will
find itself out in the cold, cruel
world by its lonesome some dark
morning. South Florida either
wants state division or the capi
tal brought nearer the center of
the state. We are growing mieh-
ty fast down this way and if we
haven't sufficient votes to secure
state division now, we soon will
have. vort Lauderdale Herald.
Wo should have state division.
Thero is little in common between
north Florida and South Florida.
We believe that the two would be
benefited bv dividing. Our devel
opment would be far more rapid.
We would then put the state s
credit behind the drainage, and
the work would be accomplished
quickly. We would soon make
the value of the 'glades greater
than north Florida. Let us agi
tate until we get it. Fort Lau

strong opposition by the Ger

gained and slight advances at oth

by the infantry are announced.

, The health authorities of the
State have discovered or redis
covered th 13 fact already during
the present mental disturbance a
bout poliomylitis, or infantile pa
ralysis. At the present writing,
not a single case, of the disease has
been brought into the State from
any center of the infection out
side of Florida. So far as the
knowledge of the health authori
ties goes, there is not a tease with
in the State, and yet rumor gos
sip has brought', reports of sever
al such cases, which when run to
earth have been traced to an over
worked imagination fired by an
overheard conversation or a mis
understood telephone, message.
The health authorities of Flor
ida, state and municipal, are
working in closest harmony to
prevent the coming of the disease,
which once having gained a foot
hold here, might bring results too
serious to contemplate, results
with larger percentage of fatality
than the visitations of yellow fe

past, fo possible avenue of in
gress is overlooked, and if the sea
son' shall pass without the coming
of tho affliction, the people of
Florida will have one more occa
sion for rendering profound
thanks to the health officers at the

The Tampa Tribune says that
the Florida republicans have only
about 14,000 votes.so if there are
two democratic tickets, one head
ed by Knott and one by Catts,
there will be enough votes for
cither to outrun the republican
ticket. The Tribune may be sure
there won't be two democratic
tickets. Mr. Knott isn't going to
run "unless he secures the nomi
nation, and we doubt that Catts
will. In event he does, however,
he will run as independent, in
which case he will receive about
one vote in three. If Catts is
declared the nominee, a number
of democrats are going to vote for
Allen. We do not know how
many, but we do not think there
will be enough to change the re
sult. The republicans, however,
have Enlarge number of voters

they should pay their poll taxes

physicians of the State are co

considered, it isn't fair to increase
the amount of this work by circu

of the disease when and where it
doesn't exist.
Infantile paralysis is not easily
diagnosable, even by the medical
profesison, in its early stages, and

the public, for the public doesn't
stop to ask where the rumor start

for the, sensational, with its fond

passes it along and it grows like
the traditional snowball, quickly
overshadowing all chances of rec

Mangoes Bring Good Price
A net profit of $60 has been re

the Edison estate m this citv. fo
a shipment of twenty-three crates
ot mangoes grown on tho Edison
property and forwarded recently
to the Chicago market, wherjf th
fruit was sold through the agency
Morch Bros. & Co. The mangoes
were shipped more or less as an
experiment, the fruit lemr littl
known throughout tho north am
oniy on rare occasions appearing
i . .
on the market in that section
Considering the fact that only the
most common varieties composed
the shipment, the price received
is considered highly gratnmg,
and it is expected that further
shipments will be made. Several
varieties grown successfully .n
Vee county, among them the Al-
phonso Bennett, bring from 20
to 25 cents each in Fort .Myers,
and it is expected that a demand
for this fruit could be established
that would result in most profit
able net returns.The possibilities
of the industry are attracting the
attention of local shippers and it
is believed that next winter sever
al carloads of mangoes will be for
warded under ice to various

BEAT IN , EVERY WAY
California Citrus Fruit When
Compared With Florida's
TOMATOES ALSO SUPERIOR
Products of 1 this State Have
Flavor and Lusciousnes3 of
Their Own
Florida products in tho way of
tomatoes and citrus fruits arc far
ahead of those grown in Califor
nia is the statement made recent
ly by Theo. F. Ahrens of Denver,
Colo.
Mr. Ahrens had just finished
cleaning up a tour of the tomato
fields throughout Florida and ac
cording to him the products of tho
Florida soil are far more in de
mand in the West even as far as
Oregon, than those of California.
"The growers in Florida," said
Mr. Ahrens, "are beginning to
learn that they have just as. fine,
if not a better market in the West
for their tomatoes as they have in
the East.l have just succeeded in
cleaning up my tomato business
and succeeded in getting about all
there were down on the" East
Coast.
"The thing that has pleased
my customers is that they were
paid on the spot, their crops yield
ing them an average of $1.40 per
crate, this being the fancies. Here
tofore they haven't got freight out
of their shipments. Of course,
choice tomatoes do not bring quite
so much, for there is not such a
demand for them."
Ahrens was asked how the Flor
ida tomatoes compare with those
grown in the North and East.
"There is no comparison to bo
made, for the Florida product
cannot be excelled. That you
may know what they are thought
of in tho West, I have just ship
ped sixty cars, besides other odd
cars heretofore." :-
"How do Florida citrus fruits
compare with the California pro
ducts?" "The Florida fruits," answered
Mr. Ahrens, "have the California
fruit beat in every way. The rea
son is simply because the Califor
nia fruit has no taste or juice,
while that of Florida has a pecu
liar flavor and lusciousness of its
own that can be found in no other.
"Another thing, "continued Mr.
Ahrens, "the people are being ed
ucated throughout the country to
the fact that; those delicious avo
cado pears are grown in Florida
and they are coming into greater
demand. Your early vegetables,
such as eggplant, Irish potatoes,
celery, young onions, lettuce and
radishes all find a ready market,
and I am introducing your okra
into the West.
"'I'm now on my way home,"
concluded Mr. Ahrens, "but, be
assured, that I shall be back here
in plenty of time, for next season's
tomato business." Okeechobeo

less DcFuniak Springs, Fla., July
18. "I am and will remain the
nominee of the democratic par
ty," declared Hon. Sydney J.
Catts when he stepped from tho
train here this morning.
"It is possible that Knott will
be the court's nominee and can
didate," .continued Mr. Catts,
"but by the vote of the people,
my friends, I wiU be tho governor
of Florida in January, .enough
said."
Mr. Catts was met by many cit
izens here who were anxious to
earn what he proposed doing, for
it is considered the court s deci
sion of yesterday refusing the pe
tition of Mr. Catts for a writ of
prohibition practicaly gives the
ead to Mr. Knott.
His statement made as he left
the train set at rest any idea that
hi would quit the fight, for he. pro
poses to claim the nomination by
tho people and will contend that
he and not Knott is the democrat-
