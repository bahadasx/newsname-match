INTERS SECOND HALF OF SERH
IN FINE SHAPE-DIFFICULT CON
DITIONS OVERCOME.
Just how near Kingstree came
throwing up the sponge and quittii
organised baseball for all time i
the wind-up of the first half of tl
Pee Dee league series a week ago
not, and never will be,known exce
by a few ardent local fans. Tl
baseball situation was in a critic
stage. Tht eruption started sever
weeks ago, when the league dire<
on met at Florence and took drasl
action against tbe Kingstree teai
throwing out practically all of tl
games won by the team andslappii
a fine of $50 against it for violatii
the rules by playing more Class
k men than were allowed. This broug
about a shake-up in the team ai
' the suspension of Manager Biel,
being contended that he knew I
was playing too many Class C me
in violation of the rules, and conti
ued to do so after being warne
Biel claimed, however, that he w
advised to "go ahead," as oth
teams were playing more class m<
than the rules provided for by sti
ulation. Any way. Manager Biel w
released and the club underwent
reorganization, the management
' the team was entrusted to "Heinic
Hewell, the efficient shortstop. T!
action of the directors in thrown
out certain frames had placed the I
f cal team at the bottom of the list
^ competing clubs, and local intere
i began to wane.
The officers of the association b
gan an inventory of the exchequ
and found that the funds were lo<
the money subscribed had been spe

so far as baseball was to be consi

home,an overdraft was crawling u

to be done.
Something was done. A few
the citizens who put up the mom
to get Kingstree into the league g
together and doubled their doc
? tlons. A message was sent over tl
wires to the manager to "go ahe;
and play ball." President Thos M

f A ARMY OFFICER IN TEXAS.
? Alpine, Texas, July 21:?Major M
h C Butler, of the 6th United States
n cavalry, and Mrs H J Spannell, with
d whom he was out riding in an autole
mobile, were shot and killed this afe
ternoon by H J Spannell, husband
e of the woman.
g
Immediately after the shooting
d Spannell went to the jail and sury
rendered. Mrs Spannell was the
e daughter of Mr and Mrs John Hole
land, well-known residents of Al^
pine. Spannell is the proprietor of
the Holland hotel here,
r- Mystery surrounds the motive of
w Harry J Spannell, manager of a local
^ hotel, for shooting and killing his
n wife and Lieut Col M C Butler of
tKio QivtKi TTnit<?H Rtntps mvalrv
I while the three were motoring yesterday
evening.
According to an announcement
>r from the county attorney tonight,
Spannell, who surrendered himseli
^ immediately after the shooting, rei
fused to discuss his case, and a thoro!
ough investigation disclosed no ap58
parent reason for the killing.
?' Spannell, who was held overnight
,0 in the county jail, was taken today
>r to another town, the name of which
a was not revealed, for safekeeping.
e The shooting took place about 8:30
^ o'clock last night while the party
(S were out driving in Mr Spannell's
o car. Spannell, who was driving, occupied
the front seat alone. Mrs
Spannell and Col Butler occupied
' the rear seat. The tragedy happene
ed in the main residential section oi
11 the city. Spannell, it seems, sudit
denly stopped his car, turned in his
seat and began shooting, using a
small calibre automatic pistol and a
\. revolver. Both victims were shot
C several times, death being instants
taneous.
e Spannell, after emptying his weapons,
walked back to the court house
e and surrendered to the authorities,
it He made no statement.
?* Apparently Col Butler was shot
first and killed instantly, for persona
~ near by heard the woman cry out
after the shooting had begun, "Harry,
don't kill me!" while the officer
made no outcry.
Previous to the shooting Spannell
had been chatting gaily with friends
at the Holland hotel, of which he
was manager.
Col Butler only recently was promoted
from the rank of major and
had been stationed here in command
of the garrison for about two months
and had become popular with the
townpeople. He lived at the Holland
hotel and he and his wife and
nine year old son were on intimate
terms socially with Mr and Mrs Spannell
and their five year old daughter.
Maj Butler was a son of the late
Matthew Calbraith Butler of Edgefield,
who was a major general of
the Confederate States army, served
18 years in the United States Senate
as a member from South Carolina
and was a major general of volunj
teers in the Spanish-American war.

Florence, July 23:?The Atlantic
Coast Line announced officially late
this afternoon that the main line
over the Santee river at St Stephens

rise. TTiey have rushed to that
point 400 coal and gondola cars to
tie the bridge and trestle ?down.
They do not anticipate any trouble
in thp wav nf washing. but fear logs
and obstructions coming down the
river and striking the bridge. They
have arranged to open the draw,
however, and to pike logs and obstructions
through as they come
down. A large force of men is sta|
tioned at the draw and along the entire
trestle three miles long with
sand bags and other material to stay

Tragic Episode of the War.
Paris, July 23:?The destruction
of a German fortified work on the
Somme front was marked by a tragic
episode, says La Liberte. The order
was given to destroy the fort at
whatever cost. In less th^n six hours
more than 2.500 great shells were
fired at it and the defenses gave way
AMA k** AVI A m a ol Ait/) /^iiaf on/)

smoke. The infantrymen went forward
and the German positions were
conquered.
French artillery officers,examining
the ruins,discovered amid a mass of
debris a Bavarian, officer with his
chest crushed and at the point of
death. At sight of the French officers
the Bavarian seemed to collect
himself, then began to speak softly,
the Frenchmen kneeling about him.
The story told by the Bavarian,
and later recounted* by an artillery
officer, was to the effect that thirtytwo
men had occupied the work. After
the bombardment had continued
for a time half of the men were victims
of an awful death. Two were
decapitated and of three others.near
rohnm n ahpll pynlndpd. not a vestige
remained. The survivors crouched at
the bottom of the subterranean shelters
and awaited their fate.
Another terrific explosion occurred,
the men being thrown together in a
confused heap. Almost immediately
flames shot up from the underground
cavern. There was a moment of indescribable
terror, for now fire was
ravaging the work. The lieutenant
in command went mad and bhouted
wildly at imaginary enemies. Th. n
in the sinister glare of the flam, s the
officer set furiously upon his men,
killing ione after another and was {

The Bavarian determined not to
die by the hand of his chief and scaled
the ruins, clinging to a slope of
the work, only to be buried under a
block of stone. He died soon after
the French officers found him,in the
hospital to which they carried him.
Ragsdale to the Rescue.
Washington, July 21:?Congressman
Ragsdale announced today that
? i s i t 1 i.
ne naa launcnen a movemeui biuuiik
buyers of tobacco that he believes
will be of inestimable value to the
growers of South Carolina. Realizing
a day or two ago that the men
who grew tobacco in that State have
suffered great financial loss in the
storm.he took up the matter of buying
the home product to the best advantage
with parties in New Yo: k.
The result is that about August 1
buyers will be on hand in South Carolina
and they have assured Mr
Ragsdale that they will pay the very
highest price.which they are able to
ffive.

OPENING OF TOBACCO MARKETS
Tuesday, August 1. Date Cbosea
by Pee Dee Associations.
Florence, July 25:?A meeting of
the tobacco warehousemen of the
West Pee Dee association, which embraces
all warehouses in South Carolina
west of the Great Pee Dee river,
was held in Florence recently for
the purpose of deciding upon a date
for opening the various markets in
their association and for transacting
such other business as might come ,
before the meeting. There was a
full attendance, nearly every market
being represented.
The tobacco situation in Eastern
Carolina was discussed and from reports
submitted it was found that
the crop had been greatly injured,
but to what extent the warehousemen
would not state nor even give
out an estimate.
The election of officers was held
and resulted in the choice of W E
Lee of Timmonsville, president; W J
Stem of Darlington, vice president,
and G H Pegram of Timmonsville,
secretary-treasurer.
It was unanimously decided, in
view of the lateness of the crop,that
all markets west of the Great Pee
Dee river would open Tuesday, August
1, for the 1916 crop.
At a meeting of the Warehouse
men's Association Jof the East Pee
Dee it was decided to open their
markets August 1, so that all tobacco
markets in South Carolina will
open up for the sale of the yellow
leaf Tuesday. August 1.
ASHEVILLE AFTER FLOOD.
Mountain City Getting Back to
Normal Conditions.
Asheville.N C.July 23:?With full
power and light facilities restored, a
few street cars operating and automobile
lines taking caie of the rest
of the traffic, Asheville proper has
practically recovered from the inconveniences
experienced by reason
of the flood of last Sunday. The
main part of the city, 500 feet above
the river section,was not touched by
the flood, save for the temporary
cutting off of railway and street car
service, together with lights and
power. The stricken section, only a
small portion,is rapidly returning to
normal. Mails are being received
over the Mi/rpby line of the Southern
railway. Service by way of Spartanburg
is promised by next Wednesday.
There is, and has been, an
abundant supply of food and the relief
committee, without outside aid,
has cared for all those from the river
section affected by the flood. In
addition to this, Asheville has sent
food and supplies both up and down
the river.
