Which Goes to Show
You Never Can Tell
H. 0. Purucker calls our attention
to a Tacoma. dispatch in the Oregon
Journal, the girls' ball team referred
to having played in Ashland some
few weeks ago. Maybe when Cleo
Kirk, who would have made a home
run If be had not stopped to "jolly"
the third baseman, reads this, he will
become a woman hater. The dispatch
follows:
Spokane, Wash, July 25. Oh,
curses!
Police asserted today that five
comely members of the "Bloomer
Girls' baseball team, which has been
barnstorming the northwest and Cal
ifornia, are not girls at all. They're
boys.
An anxious Sacramento mother
spilled the frijoles and brought cha
grin to the hearts of those men who
mayhap took opera glasses with them
to the bleachers to see the girls In
action. She wired police to inter
view her son, Albert Miller, 16, third
baseman of the "feminine" nine, and
send him home.
Detectives found Albert and four
similar "girls" at a hotel 'here. The
secret Is out! Miller has brown hair,
blue eyes and a shapely ankle. He
made a hit in bloomers. , And those
other giggling Inflelders with their
winsome glances who looked so cute
were ordinary, doggone American
kidB.
Big Company After
Ashland Pear Crop
The manager of the Ashland Fruit
& Produce Association reports that
he has Just signed up a very favor
able contract for the growers for the
Bartlett pears of the community.
The contract gives the growers $30
per ton, absolutely net, lug boxes
even furnished. Llbby, McNeil &
Libby company, with whom the con
tract is made, is one of the biggest
companies in the United States. This
year the pears will be shipped to" the
company's California plant and next
year they may possibly have a plant
of their own in the valley. Growers
should at once Inform Manager
Brlggs regarding the amount they can
offer.
Farmers' Telephone
Line To Be Built
A farmers' telephone company has
been recently organized to operate in
the country between the city and the
Ashland mine. The promoters, C. P.
Good, William Tavemer and H. B.
Warren, will build an np-to-date line
which will have no connection with
the one Just completed to the Ash
land mine.
Orders have been placed for ma
terial and actual construction will
begin in the near future.
The Kerby brothers of Talent have
the contract for getting out the poles.
Closing Out Smith's
Jewelry Store
M. C Bressler is in the city and
has closed out a mortgage against
the jewelry store and stock of his
son-in-law, R. J. Smith. The mort
gage is for $1,800. Mr. Bressler's
daughter was granted a divorce frbm
Mr. Smith a few months ago, receiv
ing the custody of their little son.
The stock will be sold at auction.
Are Cleaning Out
Lower Park Pond
Park employes are busy taking
about a foot and a half of mud but of
the basin of the lower park pond.
Assisted by Harry Hosier and a num
ber of other men conversant with
methods of handling fish, the fish in
the pond were gathered in tanks.
Most of them were taken to the up
per lake, while some will be replaced
in the lower.
Coos Bay Times: "Close to three
miles of track will be built by the
Benhner Lumber Company on North
Coos river to tap their timber hold
ings in that section."
A $200,000 unit has been planned
for the' Benson technical school at
Portland.
Cousin Killed
In Auto Race
James B. Fee, who has been In
Ashland the nast two weks. soliciting
! advertising for the Jackson County
! directory which he is assisting In
getting out, tells us that Ulysses Au
! bry, who was killed Sunday at Port
i land when the Aubry Special car
which he was driving left the track
at the Rose City spedway, was his
cousin,
Mr. Fee says that three years ago
he rode with Aubry in race meets.
He was greatly shocked to learn of
the death. Aubry's mechanician
was also killed.
Has Made Science
of Selling Goods
J. S. Langhorne, who for the past
two months has been managing the
immense closing out sale of Beebe &
Kinney, has demonstrated in his
work the efficiency of well-directed
advertising on a large scaje when
combined with a fecundity of selling
ideas backed by the business judg
ment of a man who has spent his life
at making a science of selling. Mr.
Langhorne has had something new
to "spring" every day and has kept
the crowds coming and buying. His
selling plans, backed by the real
values and quality of goods offered,
have done a tremendous amount of
business for Beebe & Kinney.
Ranchers Benefit
At County Picnic
Three hundred ranchers of Jackson
county gathered at an all-day picnic
near Central Point, Saturday. After
listening to speeches on rural co-
I operation, they decided to form a
county council to assist county agrl
j cultural officials in forming cc-opera-;
tive organizations to better buying
i and selling facilities of farmers.
C. C. Cate, coonty pathologist, pre-
' sided and the speakers included Pro-
fessor F. C. Reimer of the Talent ex
1 periment station; O. M. Plummer,
j president of the Union Packing Com
ipany of Fortland; Dr. Hector Mac
Ipherson of O. A. C; D. M. Lowe of
Ashland, and E. H. Hurd of Medford.
A portion of the meeting resolved
itself into a debate between Mr.
Plummer and the field, the former
defending the middleman and the lat
ter attacking middlemen in general
and Oregon middlemen in particular
The audience apparently enjoyed the
contest and applauded with enthusi
astic Impartiality. Dr. Macpherson
gave an interesting talk on rural
credits, reciting his experiences
abroad, and explained the state rural
credit bill which will be voted upon
this fall.
It was decided to hold follow-up
meetings through the summer and
fall and extend the organization of
granges throughout the county. Spe
cial reference will be made to co-operative
buying and selling and mutual
assistance through better organiza
tion and more enlightened methods.
Would Have Autoists
Pay for Road Work
C. C. Chapman, publisher of the
Oregon Voter, i's sending the following
resolution to granges, farmers' unions
and commercial bodies throughout
the state In an effort to ascertain
whether such a plan would provide a
solution for the problem of financing
highway improvement without adding
any new burdens to the taxpayers:
"Whereas, the wear on Oregon
roads is caused principally by auto
mobile traffic; and
"Whereas, the improvement of
through highways is of direct benefit
to automobile owners, in saving tire
and other expense; and
"Whereas, automobile owners as a
class are liberally disposed towards
road improvement and will endure an
increase of auto license fees if the
proceeds are to be expended by the
state for permanent improvement of
through roads; threfore be it
"Resolved, that we recommend to
the 1917 general assembly of the
state of Oregon the enactment of such
legislation as will bring an increased
revenue from automobile license fees,
same to be the basis for providing in
terest and sinking-fund payments for
bond Issues for permanent highway
improvement by the state."
Future Celebrations Plans
Enthuse Big Banquet Crowd
One hundred and thirty-two citi
zens of Ashland gathered at the
Hotel Austin Tuesday evening and
participated in a get-together meet
ing which for enthusiasm is unparal
leled In "the history of the series of
meetings which were inaugurated
about a year ago. Designated as a
"future celebrations" banquet, the
affair devolved Into an executive
meeting of Ashland's leading citizens
at which a number of big projects
which are ahead of Ashland were dis
cussed, plans laid and definite action
taken toward the consummtaion of
these plans.
One tact became pre-eminent:
Everybody in Ashland has a year of
hard work ahead of them to secure
the results which the city should se
cure In the next few months. But
by the proper spirit of co operation,
a spirit which became very evident
Tuesday night, Ashland can accora-
plish the things which are ahead and
make the effort gloriously worth
while.
Preceding the speechmaking and
: planning was a banquet served by
A. Austin Chisholm, the new man
ager of the hotel, which takes one
care off the minds of the citizens and
leaves them secure In the knowledge
that Ashland has a hotel manager
who is an artist In his line. Such
a dinner has never been set before
a gathering in Ashland before, and
the beautiful part of it is that those
who eat at the Austin regularly state
that the dinner was just a fair sam
ple of the meals served every day at
the Austin.
After the several courses had been
disposed of. Toastmaster Carnahan
opened up the serious business of the
evening with a witty preamble and
introduced H. O. Frohbach, who gave
a summary of the report of the gen
eral committee for the
Dedication Celebration.
Mr. Frohbach's report, which was
very satisfactory, was received with
loud applause. Rather than attempt
to give a synopsis of the report, it
will be printed in the next Issue of
the Tidings as it was read. Every
one in Ashland is interested In know
ing Jhe inside workings of our suc
cessful celebration, and Mr. Froh
bach's report showed the workings
to have been smooth indeed.
Roundup.
A. C. Nininger was then intro
duced, and after paying a glowing
tribute to the general committee for
the manner in which they had so suc
cessfully handled such an immense
celebration on such small funds,
turned to the roundup, briefly outlin
ing its history from its inception to
the present day. Mr. Nininger gave
major credit to C. R. Adams, with
Monte Brlggs a close second, stating
that had it not been for their irre
pressible enthusiasm the roundup
would never have been. 'He told
how the roundup was first considered
by the general committee, but only
$500 was available. Finally recog
nizing that this amount was Just a
drop in the bucket, Monte Brlggs of
fered the proposition that if the gen
eral committee would give the $500
he would find a group of men to take
it off their hands. The five men, A.
C. Nininger, Monte Brlggs, C. R.
Adams, O. T. Bergner and Doc
Helms, took over the affair. At first
they planned about a $4,500 show,
hut it kept growing larger and larger
until upon closing their books they
found that $9,300 had been paid out
and the organization had $2,500 in
track and stands. Mr. Nininger made
it plain that the $500 given to the
roundup people was given exactly as
it would have been given to secure
any other attraction. It is hardly
probable that anything else the $500
could have gone for would have. been
one-tenth the attraction which , the
roundup proved to be.
Mr. Nininger gave the receipt' for
the success scored as follows: "We
had to make good. We had a propo-
sition we had to get behind with all .
our power or lose, and we made it
go. We found that you must spend
money to make money, and in mak
ing it we have made money for prac
tically everybody in Ashland. We
came out with a fair profit." He
then told of the plans which are made
to make the roundup an annual
event. How stock was being sold in
small lots, and the organization
hoped to include forty or fifty men,
making each a booster. He appealed
for the co-operation of every Ash
lander in making the next year's
roundup a greater succes, and out
lined plans which are being formu-i
lated to make it a greater roundup.
He told how the Pendletou roundup
Is owned by the municipality, thus
Riving every Pendletonlan a heart in
terest in the proposition and making
bira a live booster, and expressed the
hope that every Ashlander would
come to realize that the roundup
means money In everybody's pocket
and would keep that In view.
Conventions and County Aid.
V. 0. X. Smith was the next speak
er, having "Conventions and County
Help in Advertising" as his subject.
He made an appeal to every man
present to make fuller use of the letter-writing
plan in securing Interest
in Ashland, giving concrete Instances
of what had been accomplished along
this line by letters. Showing people
through the parks and over the city,
no matter If strangers, was eulonlzed
as an ideal way of creating maximum
Interest in the city. Turning to the
j subject of conventions, he expressed
the opinion that every thinking man
could ear.ily discern the fact that
with our location half way up and
down the coast on the Southern Pa
cific main line and Pacific Highway,
with natural attractions excelling any
other city along; the line. Ashland
should with a little effort lie made
the leading convention city on the
coast. The reason that heretofore
but few conventions have been held
here lies in the fact that no effort
was made to bring them here. He
advised the placing of organized ef
fort to get conventions, into the
.hands of a man whor made such his
business. After the conventions are
here, repetition cf their visits will
rest with the people of Ashland and
the welcome which is offered, accord
ing to Mr. Smith, and Ashland will
have its earliest oportunlty to offer
this welcome with the arrival of the
Southern Oregon G. A. R. conven-.
Hon next month.
"Then entire county," stated Mr.
Smith, "should be as vitally Interest
ed, and I believe is most vitally In
terested, in Ashland's attempt to
bring tourists here." Crowds in Ash
land and Ashland's growth mean a
market for the county's products.
We are told that during the celebra
tion every hotel and rooming house
In Medford was crowded." Recogniz
ing the fact that Ashland is as big
an asset as a tourist attraction to
Jackson county as Crater Lake Is to
Klamath county and the Josephine
Caves to Josephine county, Mr. Smith
advanced the idea that the county
should assist In advertising Ashland.
A motion was carried to have a com
mittee of three approach the county
court on this subject.
Valley Attitude.
Ben Sheldon, introduced by Rev.
Carnahan as the "man whom we are
going to send to the legislature to get
the normal for southern Oregon," ex
tended the congratulations of the val
ley on the grand success of the cele
bration and assured Ashland that
Llthia Park was regarded by the en
tire county as a county asset and
recognized as a valuable attraction
to aid the upbuilding of the entire
county. With this attitude of the
valley Mr. Sheldon expressed his be
lief that the county court would look
with favor upon the plan advanced
by Mr. Smith, and ended with, "But
no matter how funds are provided,
you can count upon the co-operation
of the people down the valley."
K. D. Brlggs.
E. D. Brlggs was next introduced,
and opened his talk by offering a
motion that resolutions be forwarded
to the Rosarians at Portland, thank
ing them for their co-operation In
making our celebration a success by
donating the use of the light string-1
ers and other co-operation. The res-,
olntlon was unanimously passed
Mr. Briggs, who is one of the di
rectors of the Chautauqua associa
tion, stated that a Chautauqua audi
torium which would seat 5,000 or
C,000 people would be the greatest
asset Ashland could have In getting
conventions, and aroused a burst ot
enthusiastic applause with the state
ment that "this is one thing Ashland
is going after and must have built by
next July." "If we old fellows get
behind things as those 'boys' got be
hind the roundup, we can get any
thing we desire for Ashland.
"This city has been too conserva
tive. We have the capital and the
opportunities here, and these round
up boys have taught us a lesson
which we should profit by," said Mr.
Brlggs. Not only in the lines of re-

Mine Mill To Be
On New Location
W. A. Bartlett left Wednesday for
the east to purchase new machinery
for the Ashland mine stamp mill
which Is to be rebuilt. The new mill
will be placed on this side of the
ridge instead of the west side as for
merly, and the mine will be worked
from an old tunnel on this side. The
machinery will be electrically driven
and of the latest design. About
$2,000 In gold was supposed to have
been on the plates at the time of the
fire, and the ashes will have to be
sluiced to recover this. Two sacks
of concentrates were also unsacked.
Power Company
Forfeits Bond
The Rogue River Public Service
Corporation, which has built dams
and started power projects at various
noints alone the Rogue rlvpr fnrfnit-
.i .. timin i . . ,.
ed a $1,000 bond to the city of
Grants Pass through failure to com
mence operations within a specified
length of time. The company was
given several months leeway.
At the time that the present con
tract between the city of Ashland
and the California-Oregon Power
Company was formulated, many ob
jected on the ground that the Rogue
River corporation would furnish a
better deal.
Deer Season Opens
August Fifteenth
Contrary to the understanding of
many, the open season for hunting
deer does not open August 1, but on
August 15. Many parties are already
laying plans to join in the bombard
ment which always ushers in the deer
hunting season.
The law provides that deer with
horns may be killed from August 15
to October 31, the bag limit being
three in each season. The law fur
ther provides that the deer, after be
ing killed, must be properly tagged
with a tag taken from the license
bearing the name of the hunter and
the date on which the auimal was
killed, and to be attached in such a
manner that it shall be In plain sight
at all times.
The heavy snows of the past winter
are claimed by some to have caused
the death of many deer, but other
old-timers Btate that the deer merely
graze lower down during the winter
months, and believe that the dry sum
mers of the past two years have given
the deer enough protection so that
they are as numerous as ever.
At any rate, the snow is deeper in
the high mountains this year than
last year and the season much later,
hence the brush cannot have dried
out as much as last year when the
deer could hear the hunter approach
ing for several hundred yards, no
matter how much care was taken.
Orchardists See
Blight Effects
Over two hundred ranchers, Includ
ing many women and a party from
Grants Pass, attended the blight dem
onstration conducted by Prof. F. C.
Reimer at the Talent experiment sta
tion last week, and came away con
vinced that material progress has
been made toward evolving a type of
pear tree immune to the disease.
Prof. Reimer showed that the two
best types of blight resistant stock
are known as the Orel No. 15 and the
Surprise. These trees have a rank
crrnwth. are Dractically Immune from
tje ()lHeaso am, pro(,uce ft g00(, ))UHhy
growth. The idea is to use these
types as root stock alone, grafting
them later with standard varieties.
The great difficulty has been with
root Infections, and if a tree can be
evolved without such infection, a
great step will have been taken to
ward eliminating blight as a serious
menace in the valley.
The entire matter of blight eradi
cation is being carefully studied at
the present time, and C. C. Cate,
county pathologist, left Sunday for
the Sacramento valley, where he will
study methods of oil spray being used
not to kill the blight but to kill the
Insects which carry blight. It is said
to have been very successful in the
pear districts to the south.
Mrs. J. M. Hughes came up from
Grants Pass Monday.
Easy Grade to
Mount Ashland
Welborn Beeson of Talent recently
made a preliminary survey for a road
from near Siskiyou to Mt. Ashland,
and found a splendid route for a
highway between these two points oa
a grade of 8 per cent or less. The
airline distance from Siskiyou to the
summit of Mt. Ashland Is about five
and one-half or six miles. Leaving
the Pacific Highway at a point one
mile south of Siskiyou station on the
railroad, the first mile to the toll
road gap Is made without any appre
ciable climb. From here to the sum
mit, a distance of eight miles by the
route suitable for a good road, the
climb would be 3,000 feet. The
course of the road would be over a
comparatively smooth country pre
senting no great engineering difficul
ties, and nearly all on the south slope
of the mountains. Mr. Beeson with
his instruments made this survey In
cidentally while moving a bunch of,
sheep over the route, and is enthusi-
astic over the possibilities for a won-
, ,
derfully flue addition to Ashland's
system of scenic automobile roads.
If a grade suitable for the down trip
could be found by the way of Long's
cabin or vicinity an unusually "at
tractive route would be available for
the round trip by the toll road gap
and back through Ashland creek can
yon. Drives Engine
Up Into Seat
-I
A peculiar automobile accident oc
curred at the culvert on the Pacific
Highway four miles north of Ashland
early yesterday morning. An Over
land roadster driven by a Los Angeles
man, giving his name as Hale, struck
the cement and steel railing to the
culvert and drove the engine clear up
Into the seat of the car, the driver
miraculously escaping unharmed and
with hardly a scratch. The front ot
the car was practically demolished,
and from appearances the car must
have been traveling at a speed of
twenty-five or thirty miles an hour.
The highway is paved and Is sixteen
feet wide at the culvert. The acci
dent occurred at 3:30 in the morn
ing and it is thought that the driver
must have gone to sleep. He states
that he was driving without lights.'
