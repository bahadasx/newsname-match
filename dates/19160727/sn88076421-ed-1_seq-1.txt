THRIFTY PEOPLE
BUY URGE AMOUNT
Of STOCK
One Thousand People Have Bought
$500,000 Worth of Good Paying
Northern States Co. Stock
Within a year the Northern States
Power company has become one of the
most discussed public utility compan­
ies of the United States, because of its
plan to have its electric and gas cus­
tomers become financial partners.
Bankers, editors and economists front
one end of the country to the other
have watched the working out of the
idea and are a unit in praising its
soundness ahd general desirability.
Newspapers and magazines have de­
scribed the plan at length and some
have termed it "partial mutualization"
of this utility system serving more
than 100 communities in Minnesota,
South Dakota, North Dakota, Illinois
and Wisconsin.
J. F. McGuire, manager of the Mi­
not division of the Northern States
Power company, says:
"Approximately 1,000 people in the
cities and towns served have become
profit-sharing partners in our com­
pany. They nave invested in more
than $500,000 of the stock. The invi­
tation to our customers to join us fi­
nancially was first extended in June,
1915, and before the close of the year
inquiries from newspaper advertising
were so many that it was necessary to
establish a Securities department in
the Minneapolis headquarters. Five
men in this department now assist the
managers in handling investments and
it will probably be necessary to add to
this force soon.
"About 10 per cent of the stock tak­
en for investment by our customers
has. been on the partial payment plan.
Our idea in offering such terms is to
give the wage-earner and salaried man
or woman the same opportunity to ac­
quire an interest in the company that
is open to the individual with money
accumulated for investment.
"Our customers can buy the stock
at the rate of $5.00 a share per month
and receive 6 per cent interest on their
money while they are purchasing. I
do not know of another corporation
in the country where such liberal
terms are offered and I believe that
within a year or two at the most
thousands of thrifty people will see
the advantage of this form of invest­
ment and will become stockholders, re­
ceiving good return on their money.
"The statement has been made that
our plan is aimed to secure friends for
the company. This is true. We want
to be popular and we certainly wish to
do nothing to destroy the many evi­
dences of public good will which we
have enjoyed in the past. But if every
one of our customers held a share of
stock we cannot conceive what harm
would follow to the community. Our
security holders are often our keenest
critics. We welcome their advice and
suggestions.
"An examination was made last
winter by engineering experts for the
Harris Trust and Savings bank of
Chicago, the Guaranty Trust company
of New York, and other banks which
invested heavily in the securities of
the company. The Guaranty Trust
Trust company is the largest trust
company in the world, and none of the
banks act upon theory. They demand
facts, and when they received the re­
ports of their experts on the Northern
States Power company they were more
than satisfied with the properties, and
they were amazed at the productive­
ness and prosperity of the cities and
towns served by the organization.
"Due to the prosperity of the terri­
tory served and to our willingness to
make extensions and enlargements,
the business of the Northern States
"Power company continues to grow, and
•the stock to become more and more
desirable as an investment.
SEVERAL DRUNKS PUT IN JAIL
Max, N. D., July 25.—A drunken
-fight took place down on the east end
of the stock yards, the result of too
much beer, and a farmer living north
of town got hit over the head with a
beer bottle and was cut severely. Two
•of the participants in the fight were
arrested and taken before Justice
Langbell and an investigation institut
ed by Village Attorney Wright and
O. Thompson resulted in the arrest of
a Mr. Fox and a Marr on the charge
of bootlegging. Fox attempted to
-make his getaway but was caught by
the marshal and "Mr. Kloster after a
chase through the'wheat field east of
town. The following morning a war­
rant was also issued for a fellow by
the name of Yomansky, charging him
with bootlegging, and he was arrested
up in Ward county by Sheriff Hend­
ricks.
An amusing thing happened short­
ly after Mr. Fox had* been placed in
jail. Mr. Kloster, who was guarding
the jail, discovered Fred Helgeson in
the act of passing some beer in to the
prisoner through the bars and Mr.
Kloster promptly took charge of the
liquid refreshments and placed Helge,
son in the other cell.
The three bootleggers were given a
hearing before Justice Langbell, F. E.
Wright prosecuting on behalf of the
states attorney, and all three ware
bound over to the district court. Mr.
Fox and Mr. Marr, being unable to
furnish bonds, were taken to Wash­
burn by Sheriff Hendrick,s, while.
Yomansky was released under $500
bonds. Krowsowsky pleaded guilty to
the charge of being drunk and disor­
derly and was fined $10 and costs,
amounting in all to a little over $20.
Slavinsky was discharged by the jus­
tice and Fred Helgeson pleaded guilty
to the charge of having liquor in the
village jail and was fined $15 and
costs.
Buying Furniture for McCoy's
Large New Furniture Store
Paul V. McCoy, president of the Mc­
Coy Furniture Store, and the manag­
er, L. C. Cooksey, send word from Chi­
cago and Grand Rapids, that they are
buying a complete new stock of furni­
ture, draperies, rugs and house fur­
nishings for the new store which will
open between Sept. 15 and Oct. 1.
Mr. McCoy, who recently bought
two lots from Olaf A. Olson on south
Main street, intending to build, found
that it was impossible to complete the
building in time, so leased the Frank
Anderson block, opposite the Federal
building, where the new store will be
located.
Farmers' Hitching Posts
The Association of Commerce is now
working with Jos. Belanger, local ag­
ent for the Soo, on plans for a lot with
hitching posts for the accommodation
of the farmers who trade in Minot. It
is understood that the Soo is agree­
able to the plan and if this is the
case the farmers will feel like erect­
ing a monument in honor of the pop­
ular Soo agent and Secretary Hol­
bein.
Dalen's Overland Makes an
Excellent Record
Mr. H. O. Dalen recently made a trip
from here to points in Minnesota,
which amounted to more than 2,000
miles ,in his Overland Model 83. Mr.
Dalen reports that he made the trip
from Minot to Minneapolis in thirty
hours and fifty minutes, the last 100
miles into Minneapolis being made on
an average of 35 miles per hour.
During the entire trip he averaged
more than fifteen miles to the gallon
of gasoline and the total lubricating
oil used did not amount to three gal­
lons.
A great part of the 2,150 miles was
made under very bad road conditions,
on account of heavy rains in Minneso­
ta and South Dakota.
In the whole number of 2,150 miles
never once was Mr. Dahlen obliged to
use a wrench or any tool whatsoever
on his Overland Model 88. This car
had been run several hundred miles
before Mr. Dahlen bought it. Today
he states that the car is performing
as well as it did the day he started on
his trip.
Mr. Dahlen is one who has driven a
great many different cars and one
could not be more enthusiastic than
he is over the service he is getting out
of his Overland car.
Hutching WillEntertain.
Friends of W. £}.,Hutchins, the very
live Outcault advertising man, have
received unique invitations to attend
a birthday party at his home in this
city on the evening of July 29. The
invitations were printed on the half
of torn collars, addressed and stamped
on the opposite side. If the party will
be in keeping with the invitations, it
will be a very novel and enjoyable af­
fair.
STORMS KILL ONE

Big Losses Through Hail in North­
west Section of the State
Are Reported
Ambrose, N. D., July 25.—One man
was killed and heavy property dam­
age was done in a storm that swept

ment Lands Good Government
Political Plum
Wm. O'Leary has been appointed
Register of the Minot land office to
succeed V. A. Corbett, whose term ex­
pired several months ago. Mr. Cor­
bett is still holding the position until
his successor qualifies. Mr. O'Leary
will be installed in the office within
two or three weeks.
Mr. O'Leary has been chief of Mi
not's fire department for a number of
years, making an enviable record. He

litical matters and has a good clean
record. He is well qualified for the
place and is receiving the congratula­
tions of his many friends.
Mr. O'Leary's successor as chief of
the fire department has not yet been

swept over a country from Crown
Butte to the southwest and toward
Mandan.
HON. THOMAS MURPHY
IS NOW A LAWYER
Thos. Murphy, register of the Wil
liston land office for the past four
years, has been putting in some good
hard licks on the side studying law.
He recently passed the state bar ex­
amination with a very high average.
Mr. Murphy is one of the state's
brightest young men and when he op­
ens his law office, which will not hap­
pen until his term as register expires,
he will undoubtedly be heard from in
a legal way.
NEGRO ELUDES POSSE
OF FORTY ARMED MEN
Suspected of Surrey Postoffice Rob­
bery, Pulls Gun on Chief Doherty
—Lively Chase Follows
In a man-hunt In the wood along the
river jugt east of the city Friday aft­
ernoon, a negro with a big gun and a
wicked-looking eye, who was suspect­
ed of robbing the Surrey postoffice the
night before, eluded Chief of Police
Dan Doherty and about forty special
deputies, all armed to the teeth. The
negro must have hidden in the woods
for no trace of him could be found and
under cover of darkness he made good
his escape.
The Surrey postoffice was entered
early Friday morning and $14 taken
from a cash drawer. The safe was
cracked but the door was not opened,
$50 being in the safe, and a like
amount outside was overlooked.
Chief Dohertfy was notified and he
started out with his club to locate the
guilty parties. In the woods near the
city he found a negro and two other
tough looking characters. As he step­
ped forward to search the negro, the
dusky fellow pulled an immense gun
and held it under the chief's nose. Mr.
Doherty, not having his gun, could do
nothing but back away. He came up
town in a hurry, secured his arsenal
and a posse and went out after the
bad man. That the negro was one of
the postoffice robbers is almost a cer­
tainty.

Fries of South Dakota, who are visit­
ing at the home of Mrs. Fries' brother,
T. F. Gullixson, suffered a crushed

over the child's leg. The surgeon be­
lieves that within a few weeks the
child will be as well as ever, although
the injury was very serious.

pany she won the title, "Mother of the
Company," of which she was justly
proud.
MOUNTRAIL FARMER GETS
TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON
THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WEEKLY PAPER IN THE STATE
Vol. 15 No. 15. Minot, Ward County, North Dakota, Thursday, July 27, 1916. Subscription $1.50 Per Annum
John Rowland, the Ross farmer who
shot and killed Harry Walcott, a
neighbor lad, was sentenced to serve
20 years in the penitentiary. His
wife, who was with her husband, went
free. Mrs. Rowland is a nervous lit­
tle woman who can scarcely speak the
English language. According to the
story told by Carl Moore, a young man
who was with the Walcott lad when
he was shot, the two young men were
riding past the Rowland home on a
load of nay. The horses became fright­
ened and ran towards the Rowland
home. There had been trouble be­
tween the Rowlands and the Walcotts
and Rowland and his wife came out
with a gun. Rowland began shooting,*
one bullet going through young Wal
cott's stomach, causing his death about!
a week later. As Moore jumped ofl£f:coe,
the load and ran, he heard Mrs. Row­
land urging her husband to shoot him
and heard several bullets whiz past
him. Rowland did not appear to care
much when sentence was passed.
BRISCOE CAR GETS
TWO PRIZES
STATE EAIR
Palda-Morse Motors, Inc., Receive
Word of the Machine's Great
Record
Word was received yesterday by
Palda-Morse Motors, Inc., of this city
who are the distributors of the Briscoe
automobile for the entire Northwest,
that the Briscoe had walked away
with the money in two of the great
speed events at the North Dakota
State fair.
The first event was a time trial in­
troducing the cars and drivers in
which the Briscoe car was bested by a
Fiat by only one-fifth of a second.
Those participating and the time were
as follows:
Horey, driving a Fiat—1:13 3-5.
Kilpatrick, driving a Briscoe—1:13
4-5.
Raineg, driving a Maxwell—1:14
3-5.
Hoffman, driving a Tornado—1:16
3-5.
Woodbury, driving a Duesenberg,
1:17 1-5.
The real thriller was the three-mile
event in which there were five entries
and it was a real contest for the first
prize of $200, and a second prize of
$75. The contest was between Hearne
in his Briscoe and Horey in his Fiat,
the only foreign car on the track this
season. Hearne fairly ate up the dis­
tance and came over the tape in 3:54
1-5 Horey, driving a Fiat, second
Hoffman, driving a Tornad, third
Mais, driving a Duesenberg, fifth.
None of the domestic cars were in the
same class with the Briscoe.
One of the most interesting races of
the day was the fifteen-mile free-for
all, run in two elimination heats and a
final. The two first in the slowest heat
and the three first in the fastest heat
were chosen as five starters for the
final ten miles. The elimination heats
were of five miles each.
Each of these heats was a real race,
the first five miles being wheeled off
in 6:29 flat, with Mais in the Mias spe­
cial, first Kilpatrick, driving a Bris­
second Rainey, driving a Max­
well, third Woodbury, driving a Dues­
enberg, fourth.
In the second heat Eddie Hearne in
his Briscoe was among the leaders and
first place practically assured when
a valve spring broke, compelling him
to drop out after the heat was half
run.
The Briscoe car has not been very
well represented in this section of the
state heretofore, but the car is rapidly
becoming very popular and the public
is becoming very much interested in
its performance. Now, with a dis­
tributing plant for the western part of
the state located at Minot the Briscoe
will without doubt be one of the lead­
ing cars in this locality. It is claimed'
to be the best $625.00 car on the mar­
ket. The engine is universally known
as the half-million dollar engine.

lowstone hospital suffering from in­
juries received as a result of the run­
away.
Horses Bridles Seized
Only the heroic work of L. Western
hagen of the Fargo, N. D., Courier
News prevented the second coach from
going over the cliff. He seized the
horses' bridles and turned them to one
side.
J. F. Hamilton of the American
Printing company, Miles City, is in a
critical condition with a broken leg,
dislocated shoulder and scalp wounds.
His wife's left leg is broken.

automobile and a fall over a high
cliff was barely averted.
Atty. Wysong May Become Captain
Atty. C. C. Wysong left for Bis­
marck Monday morning where it is
possible that he will enter the recruit­
ing service in the event that another

greatest military schools in the Unit­
ed States.
Williston Took Three More
Games From the Minot Team
Minot lost the first of the series with
Williston at the ball park Friday eve­
ning, 4 to 3. The Magicians played
an errorless game, while Williston
made two errors. The game was the
best played on the local diamond up
to that time during the season. Hoff­
man pitched for Minot and Browning
for Williston.
Williston won the second game Sat­
urday afternoon, 5 to 4, with Ruyle
pitching against Spillane, and they
took the third game Sunday afternoon
3 to 2, with Marshall pitching against
Morris. The games were all dandies
and the crowd got their money's
worth.
Fred Veth's Father Is Dead
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Veth, Jr., were
'called to Minneapolis Monday night
bv the death of Mr. Veth's father. The

GOV. HANNA DEDICATES BRIDGE
Medora, N. D., July 25.—Facing an
audience of hundreds of cowboys and
cowgirls on horseback, and a crowd of
several thousands in automobiles, in
wagons and afoot, Gov. L. B. Hanna
of North Dakota dedicated the new
Red Trail bridge over the Little Mis­
souri river at this point.
The governor declared that the com­
pletion of the bridge marked the ar­
rival of the new era of the automobile
in western North Dakota, and the
passing of the days of wagon traffic
through the Bad Lands.
SEVERE STORM DAMAGE
DONE AT WESTBY, MONT.
Westby, Mont., July 25.—Two per­
sons were injured and property dam­
age estimated at $100,000 was done by
a severe wind and rain storm which
swept this district late Sunday. An
area twenty-five miles wide and forty
miles long was affected, according to
reports received.
Joseph Bigu and M. Haugen were
hit by flying timbers and seriously in­
jured. The terrific' wind demolished
small farm buildings, moved heavier
structures from their foundations and
damaged crops.
EVIDENCE OF THREATS
AGAINST BEACH VICTIM
Beach, N. D., July 25. Evidence
tending to show that Horace Ball, kill­
ed by a dynamite bomb placed under
his shack while he was asleep, had
been threatened with violence if he
failed to remove his shack, has been
uncovered by authorities. They have
been unable, however, to trace the
source of these threats. So far, that
is the lone evidence obtained in con­
nection with the mysterious case.
FIRE COSTS NEW ROCK FORD
ITS FOURTEENTH ELEVATOR
New Rockford, N. D., July 25.—The
Ely-Salyards Elevator company grain
v/arehouse was destroyed by fire to­
day with a loss of $20,000. Twelve
thousand bushels of grain were in the
structure. Spontaneous combustion
caused the fire.
This is the fourteenth elevator burn­
ed here since the town was establish­
ed.
SKULL FRACTURED AND
CONDITION IS GRAVE
Paul Johnson Hurt by Falling Rod
While Engaged in Well Drill­
ing Operations
While engaged in fixing the auger
of a well drilling machine, sixty feet
below the surface, Paul Johnson, age
20, son of Mr. and Mrs. Emery John­
son, had his skull fractured by a drill­
ing rod which in some way became
disconnected and dropped 35 feet,
striking him a glancing blow on the
back of the head. Much difficulty was
experienced in getting the injured boy
to the surface. Two attempts were un­
successfully made to bring the limp
body to the surface. Finally Thomas
Morgan was sent for and after bring­
ing to the surface several rods whicn
blocked the well he reached the un­
conscious boy and, tying him securely,
lifted him in his arms and together
they were drawn to the surface. It
was a courageous act on the part of
Mr. Morgan and great credit should
be given nim for his heroic deed. Aft­
er being released from the well, Paul
was carried to the hospital where the
wound was dressed. Tne injury is in­
deed a serious one, as the brain has
been exposed through the fracture of
the skull and deep concern is felt for
his recovery.
FIRST
SECTION
Eltm MEN ESCAPE
FROM THE STATE
PEMTEIM
Picked Way Through Weak Place la
Wall—Three Have Been Cap­
tured—Negro Leader
Bismarck, July 24.—Three of tho
eight men who escaped from the North
Dakota penitentiary Saturday noon
have been captured, and with every
building of every description within a
radius of 75 miles of the penitentiary
thoroughly searched by the scores erf
volunteer posses that were organized
indications are that the other five
have succeeded in making along jump
out of the district.
Either they have gotten well out of
the district, or the are being con
clealed at the homes of friends within
a few miles of the prison, is the con­
clusion of Warden Talcott.
Had Outside Aid
To make their escape, the eight men,
who got out of the prison through a
hole jn the prison wall, where they
had attacked a weak point, had out­
side assistance. It would be impossible
to pick the weak point on the inside
of the prison wall without having the
measurement on the outside, for the
inside of the wall is perfectly plain,
the weak point being shown on the
outside. This fact that the men hit
this weak point to within the inch, is
regarded as proving outside aid.
Neavels and McGee Leaders
W. H. Neavels, former guard at the
prison, and who was serving time for
a boxcar robbery, and Mack McGee,
negro murderer, are regarded as the
ring leaders. For their capture, and
for the capture of two other men still
at large, Warden Talcott has offered a
reward of $100.
The escape was made possible
through the fact that at the hour it
was effected, guards are withdrawn
from a portion of the prison wall, to
guard men in the big prison bath
rooms. The men attacked the wall with
a crow bar and succeeded in making
their way through the two feet oi
brick and mortar, and getting well out
of the way before their escape was
discovered.
Two of the escaped prisoners, An­
drew Schmidt and Adolf Thorberg,
were captured before evening, while a
third man, Alley Fyles, colored, was
recaptured about midnight Saturday.
The Missing Men
The men still at large are:
James Gleason, white aged 28,
dark skin, black hair, weight about 156
pounds is 5 feet 9 inches tall. Re­
ward, $100.
W. H. Neavels, white, 26, light
brown hair, 172 pounds, 5 feet 11 inch­
es. Reward, $100.
J. J. King, white, 42, gray hair, 150
pounds, 5 feet 7 inches. Reward, $100.
Orsage Rudolph, white, 27, brown
hair, 143 pounds, 5 feet 7 inches. Re­
ward, $50.
Mack McGee, negro, 26, 148 pounds,
5 feet 8 inches. Reward, $100.
King escaped June 30 and was re­
captured and returned from Aberdeen
last week. He was aided from the out­
side in this escape and taken to South
Dakota by auto. Gleason was sent up
from Mohall and has prison records at
Sing Sing and other penitentiaries.
SCHOOL TEACHER LOSES EYE
J. H. Clemens of Kenmare, who has
been teaching school at Granville, lost
the sight of one of his eyes while he
was working as machinist for the In­
ternational Harvester company at Tol
ley. A piece of steel pierced the eye,
destroying the sight. He was brought
to Minot where the injured optic was
removed.
PAYS DEARLY FOR BIT OF
SHADE UNDER BOXCAR
Mandan, N. D., July 25—Jack Ryan,
32, seeking relief from the hot sun by
lying in the shade under a boxcar,
pays one leg for his brief pleasure.
Ryan fell asleep and a switch engine
pushed the car over his leg, severing
the left limb just below the knee.
NATURAL GAS DISCOVERED
IN CROSBY VICINITY
Crosby, N. D., July 25.—That there
is natural gas lying under the Crosby
country was demonstrated on the
farm worked by Harvey Hoover, five
miles north of Crosby. A flow of wat­
er containing natural gas was secured
there. The water flows somewhat in­
termittently and bubbles like carbon­
ated water. When a cupful of water
is taken from the well and a lighted
match held over it a blue flame burns
for several seconds.
STANLEY MEAT MARKET
CHANGES HANDS
Stanley, N. D., July 25.—A deal was
closed whereby Ira Wooster became
the proprietor of the City Meat Mar­
ket, which P. J. Colvert has very suc­
cessfully operated for the past two
years.
Mr. Wooster has had a wide experi­
ence in the butcher business.
Mr. and Mrs. Coltert have not yet
decided whether they will leave Stan­
ley or not, but they have a host of
friends here who would be pleased to
hear that their intentions are to re­
main in Stanley.
BOY KILLED BY FALL
Valley City, N. D., July 25.—Theo­
dore Leroy, 5 years old, was instantly
killed Monday when he fell from a
1 grain wagon driven by his father,
