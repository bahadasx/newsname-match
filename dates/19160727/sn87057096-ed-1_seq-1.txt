109 LEON CARS IN RUN
When £.ie Jefferson Highway Socia

4 day, and Many Were Missed.
!'N- The sociability run of the directors
j, of tlie Jefferson Highway, which
started from St. Joe, Mo., last Thurs
day afternoon to make the run to
Winnipeg, B. C., arrived in Leon Fri
»day morning promptly on time. Car
No. 1 which was scheduled to arrive
at Leon at 10:50, picked up a nail a
few miles south of Leon and was
passed by Car No. 2, but No. made
a quick change of tire and left Leon
at 11:01, just one minute behind
schedule time.
The square and adjoining streets
•were packed with autos, all who ex-
pected to accompany the official party
to the next town on the route having
their car decorated with a "J. H."
banner. The K. of P. band occupied
the band stand and greeted the tour
ists with some fine music, and free
lemonade was served to everyone.

as only short stops could be made
at any town, the speaking was limit
ed. In this city Walter Parker, of
New Orleans, La., Paul Nesbit-, of
McAlister, Oklahoma, and E. J.
Bracken, of Greenville, Texas, made
short talks, telling of what the Jef
ferson Highway Association hoped to
accomplish and what they had al-
Missouri and in Iowa as far as they
had traveled. The new official sign
board of the Jefferson Highway, a
white metal sign with the new em
blem of the association, a palm and
a pine was shown and they will
shortly be placed ulong the entire
route.
Hon. E. T. Meredith drove from
Des Moines to Leon, joining the par
ty here and accompanying them
across Iowa. He was escorted to the
band stand upon his, arrival and
made brief remarks, explaining his
position on the subject of good roads,
and denying the charge that he was
in favor of paved roads or of issuing
bonds for paved roads, except where
a district voted'for the bonds them
selves. He said the people should
have the kind of roads they wanted,
but above all they should receive
value for the money which is spent on
roads in Iowa. He stated that the
state of Iowa could have good roads
the year around without increasing

The great Selig ten reel feature
play, "The Ne'er-Do-Well" by the
la:nous author, Rex Beach, will be
shown at the Idle Hour theatre on
Friday, July 28th, at a special mati
