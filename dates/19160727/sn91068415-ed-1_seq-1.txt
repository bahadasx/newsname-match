A TRIP TO THE YADKIN
Viewing the Results of the Recent Flood
Great Holes Washed Beside the
River Bed A Rocking Chair
Bobbing UpA Human
Event Story. ,
Sunday the editor and family
motored over the good roads from
Hijih Point to the Yadin river bridge,
there to view the results of the re
cent flood.
The approach to the bridge for
about 1,000 yards showed the effects
of the high water, the corn being
drowned out and large piles of sand
washed over the land, with big gul
lies and holes here aud there, the
land looking like it had been disar
ranged by the hand of man instead
of the swirling waters that poured
through the channel of the Yadkin
river and rose for more than 20 fset
hi4h, and spreading for hundreds of
feet on the low lands. The ground
was wet and soggy and the filth of
the flood had found lodgment here
and there presenting an unsanitary
appearance to say the least.
The main part of the bridge is
just a little higher than the highest
embankment on the Davison county
side of the bridge and this no doubt
saved the hridge as much of the
water overflowed the banks and
help relieve the strain on the main
current. On the Rowan side the bridge
is a trifle lower (that is figuring the
middle of the bridge divides the
two counties) and here is the only
place the water really covered the
main part of the bridge. On the
Davidson county side the approach
to the main part of the bridge for
about 50 feet was washed away,
this short distance being constructed
of wood which already dhows the
wear and tear of years by travel
and weather. This has been hastily
reconstructed but on examination
shows it to be none too strong.
The main part of the bridge is
iron resting on extra large rock pil- j
iars weii rcmemea,anu praceo witn Lichn&-tf business trirv
mm tnftf. TR2SB pfflars are ap-T . ' All.f5tl. H. r. Rom,
proximately 30 feet in length, 20
feet across and 6 feet in diameter
and it is no wonder they were able ;
to withstand the mighty on rush of
water and debris, the accumulation
of myriads of streams as they j
found their way into the larger
stream. Great piles of logs, boards,
trtes, lumber, bales of cotton and
other things beat against these pil
lars which stood Gibraltar-like
throughout the test of strrngth le
tween the flood and its toll and the
Uieat pillars of strength.
Passing under the arches of this
bridge were live stock, human be
ings and almost everything imagina
ble during the mad rush of the wa
ters during the recent floods. Hun
dreds of people visited the Yadkin
river front Sunday and Monday
previous expecting to witness the
undoing of this mammoth structure
but little did they reckon the
strength of rocks and steel that
field it together and today it is safe
end hardly will another such flood
happen in this generation.
While standing on the bridge and
looking at the water and debris col
lected around one of the main rock
pillars our eyes rested on something
that looked like a back of a chair j
and as the waters churned the con- -
L'lomprarinn r.f wnnd the chair bob-!
bed up and down and pretty soon
the outlines of a -child s rocking
chair came to view. Only a little
chair with nothing to indicate where
it came from or the former owner
and to the uninterested nothing to
draw upon the imagination. But
here, perhaps, was a human event
story speaking out more eloquently
than words in the bobbing up of
this little rocking chair as the wa
ters swirled around it and finally
carried it down the stream, onward
to the mighty Atlantic. Perhaps
only a few days before some little
flaxen haired girl had sat in this
very rocker and cooed and sang
lullabvs to a flaxen haired doll. Ah.
if that little chair could talk me
thinks it would tell of many a happy
moment in a home where father
and mother ruled and the little
flaxen haired occupant was queen
Maybe the little girl who was snatch
ed from the mothe. o embrace in that
far away mountain hwme by the
angry flood and carried to a wa
tery grave that dreadful Saturday
night cf July 15th owned that very
little rocking chair. Who knows?
There are countless hours of happi
ness, days of anguish and a large
part of life's story sometimes wrap
pep up. as it were, in such incon
sequential looking things only a
little rocking chair coming from
Cod knows where and rushing out
to sta!

which will soon become a pleasant
duty and it will only require a few
minutes each week.
It will be a good thing to have
the news on your route or in your
community read by the people
along the route each week and you
willSbe praised for your work by
them and rewarded by this paper!
Each month we are going to re
ward a first and second prize for the
best news letter from the corres
pondents. The first prize will be 50c
the second 25c.
Annual and semi-annual prizes
will also be given. To the corres
pondent who does not fail to send a
letter each week FOR ONE YEAR
will receive in addition to the other
monthly prizes $2 00; for 6 months
$1.00. The correspondent being the
next nearest perfect score during
the year will receive $1.00 and 50c j

TRUTH AND HONESTY IN -AD
VERTISING.
Thre are several advertisers the
The Review does not solicit from
various reasons, in fact we would
refuse them, without they conformed
at least to a spirit of fairness and
truth. It is due our subscribers to
protect them from fake and frauds
and not to 1 run every ad that we
could get forthe little money there
is in it, and so long as we run this
pewspaper we are going to demand
that no advertiser make a state
ment that he doesn't expect to carry
out. Exaggeration and catch items
to deceive have no place in the col
umns of a newspaper serving honest
people.
Recent Law Saves The
Property Owners
Mr. Brockett comes out with the
statement that the State Wide bill
of 1915 provides that the abutting
property owners pay only one-fourth
of the cost of fixing the streets in-,
stead of one-third as the election to
be held next month in this city pro
vides. This is a good point raised
by Mr. Brockett and we thoroughly
agree with him in the statement
that it would be "eminently unfair
to charge one-third of the cost of
improvement to property under the
Brockett act and later .one-fourth of
the cost to other property that may
be improved." So why should even
the most enthusiastic bond promot
ers want to pay more for. improving
their property than the State-wide
law requires? Wenardly think they
will.
' THE MUSHROOM CITY
Parties coming in every now and
then from Hopewell, Va., say the
mushroom city has collapsed like
the veritable wild "vegetable" on a

now been sounded by scores of in

was visiting in the country and she
Lremarked that it was worth $50 a

that if her husband didn'c soon leave
she would leave him. So there you

TAKE A VACATION SOON
It if Time to Take a Vacation Every
body That Works Either Mentally or
Physically Needs Vacation Some
time During the Year '
remaps you tnmK you can't af
ford to take a vacation this year.
The fact is, in general you can't, af
ford. not to take one. You can't
afford not to rest your ' mind and
body and get away from routfne
work.
Perhaps, you have not thought
what a breaks-down or spell of sick
ness would cost you. The old ad
dage, "a stitch in time saves nine,"
is applicable to our nealth as to our
clothes.
You mav not be" able to afford aa
expensive trip to the seashore or to
the mountains but jfou can afford a
rest and change of environment for
at least a few days.
A few important points not to be
overlooked in taking your vacation
are:
First, go where your health wiU
not be in jeopardy. Stay at no
place where there are flies or mos
quitoes. Second, know that where
ever you go there are sanitary
means for the disposing of sewerage
Third, know that the milk is , clean.
Fourth, know that your drinking
water is pure. Fifth, be vaccinated
against typhoid fever before leaving
home, thereby reducing your 'chanc-
or 100 per cent.
A few don'ts will perhaps be in
place pefore making the start.
Don't take too much baggage.
Don't take any cares or worries.
Don't exercise too strenously at
first.
Don't eat injudiciously.
Don't spend too much money.
Don't forget that rest is what you
are there for and that a .vacation
that does net put new life into your
body and joy into your heart is a
failure. k i
