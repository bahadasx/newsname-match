WORKMEN WILL NOT
HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE
Plan As Outlined Is Result of
More Than Six Years'
Investigation.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 3—Two mil­
lion dollars was the gift made by
Swift & Co. to their employes Mon­
day. Announcement of the accumu­
lation of this sum during the past six
years in the form of a pension /und
occasioned much gratification to
workers in the plants and branch
houses in all cities where it was made
simultaneously. It is estimated that
more than 30,000 men and women are
eligible, in time, to come under the
provisions of the fund, which became
active Aug. 1
One of the striking features* of the
plan as outlined is that the employes
do not contribute to the fund, the
company furnishing absolutely all
money needed to pay pensions. In
this connection it is expected that
Swift & Co. will be called upon to pay
$400,000 a year in addition to the in­
come from the fund, in order to meet
the demands. In Chicago alone 8,000
persons will come under the plan as
outlined.
Studied tOlier Systems.
"Swift & C'o. have had a pension
plan under consideration for over six
years and during that time have ac­
cumulated for the purpose a fund of
$2,000,000," said Louis F. Swift, presi­
dent of the company. "In that time
\ve have studied dozens of pension
plans in effect in other organizations,
both contributory and non-contribu­
tory and we believe that we have se­
lected the best points of these and
have added a number of good fea­
tures that are- distinctive. It has been
the aim of Swift & Co. to tie its em­
ployes to itself in many ways. We
have worked to that end for years.
The pension plan is our scheme for
rjfcWardirry^hisrfaittoful service."
Features of Plan.
The salient points of the plan as
outlined in the formal announcement
to employes follow:
1. The employes do not contribute
to the fund.
2. Income from the $2,000,000
foundation fund is to be supplemented
annually by Swift. & Company until
the fund is large enough to meet the
necessary demand^.
8. More than 30,000 employes to
benefit by the announcement.
4. Men in the employ of the com
ny twenty-five years, "who have
reached the age of sixty may be pen­
sioned.
5. Men In the employ of the com­
pany twenty-five years and who have
reached the age of sixty-five years
shall be pensioned.
Women in service twenty-five
years, who have reached the age of
fifty may be pensioned.
7. Women in service twenty-five
years, who have reached the age of
fifty-five shall be pensioned.
8. Employes in service fifteen
years and up to twenty-five years,
who are permanently incapacitated
for work may be pensioned.
9. Pension of those retired on ac­
count of age and length of service, or
if incapacitated after a servic of
twenty-five years, but prior to the
age of retirement, shall be one-half
of the average salary for the five
years preceding retirement.
10. Pension of those retiring on
account of incapacity after from fif­
teen to twenty-five years of service
shall be computed on a basis of one
and one-half per cent of the average
salary for the five year period pre­
ceding retirement, for each year of
continuous service.
11. No pension shall be less than
$240 per year.
12. No pension shall be in ex­
cess of $5,000 per year.
The United States is now facing the
most stupendous naval appropriation
bill ever proposed in the history of
the world.
If it is carried out, it will seriously
menace our relations with every other
great world power, especially Great
Britain who will have to redouble her
efforts, to maintain her traditional
two-power standard. The chant of
the Democratic national convention
at St. Louis: "He kept us out of war
he kept us out of war," may be radic­
ally recived by history.. G. Lowes
Dickinson, the English publicist and
a man who weigh'-his words, has de­
clared in public his belief that a huge
naval program would compel England
to go to war with us in five years. It
is only one man's opinion, perhaps,
but we give it for what it is worth.
The situation' has many ramifica­
tions. but reduced to its very simplest
elements, it may be described as fol­
lows:
The house of representatives has
passed one naval appropriation bill
and the senate has passed another,
and much larger, one. A joint con­
ference committee is being appointed
today to reconcile the glaring differ­
ences between the two bills. The
senate,has selected three "big navy"
men for its representatives—Senator
Tillman of South Carolina, Senaitor
swanspn.of Virginia and Senator

THE
Changes' In Factory System In
America Makes Unions Neces­
sary, Says Weber.
gans ,ong women workers was
urged by .nk J. Weber of Milwau­
kee, general organizer of the Wiscon­
sin state federation of labor, in his
report to the annual convention.
"The modern factory system," he
said, "has brought a great change
and the old law that the female must
honor and obey, because she was con­
sidered a dependent, is no longer ap­
plicable to our present inudstrial sys­
tem because the female has been com­
pelled to become a part of our mod­
ern factory system as a wage earner.
Since she has entered the field of
industry it is of the greatest impor­
tance to have her become a consti­
tuted part of the organized ablor
movement to better her condition as
such."
The unionist recorded sharp criti­
cism of the practice of Importing
armed lhen and giving them the au­
thority of peace officers in districts
where strikes are in progress.
So-called scientific management, he
declaimed, would produce an army of
middle-aged workers, crippled in
mind and body, unable to keep the
pace demanded by this system and
who would prove a burden to society.
The convention voted a %-cent-a
day tax on all members in the state
for the benefit

BARBERS STOP SUNDAY
WORK IN PHILADELPHIA
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 3.—There is
a law against barber shops operat­
ing on Sunday, but the law was open­
ly violated "for the convenience of
the public," despite protests by the
barbers. As the latter were unorgan­
ized, theJr individual claims were" not
•considered.
The Barbers' union finally took
charge of affairs and inaugurated an
organizing campaign. Several hun­
dred shops were then struck. Muni­
cipal officials, sworn to uphold the
law, aided the employers and many
unionists were arrested in their effort
to abolish^ the seven-day work week.
The Master Barbers' association
now acknowledges it has been de­
feated and has written Mayor Smith
"to personally see" that violators of
the Sunday closing law are prose­
cuted.
As it Is risky to call the attention
of workers to their power through
organization, the success of the Bar­
bers' union has been given little pub­
licity by many law-abiding citizens in
this vicinity.
RUBBER WORKERS COMPROMISE
CHELSEA, Mass., Aug. 3.—Striking
rubber workers have voted to accept
a compromise offer by the Revere
Rubber company. All strikers are re­
employed and a general advance of
$1 a week is secured. The former
59,-hour week for men is reduced to
54 hours, and 54 hours for women is
reduced to 53 hours. Time and one
half for overtime will be paid, in­
stead of straight time, as formerly.
These workers are affiliated to the
A. F. of Ij. The settlement affects
about 700 persons. They have been
on strike since the. first of last month.
STRIKE TO PROTECT LIFE.
BEAUMONT, Texas, Aug. 3.—Be­
cause the Beaumont Light and Power
company refused the request of its
organized electrical workers to place
a competent foreman over them, these
workers suspended work. They agreed
to waive a demand that wages be
equalized to surrounding territory if.
their lives are protected. It is claimed
that the excessive voltage of hijfh
power wires is doubly dangerous.
The house members will include three
"big navy" members, Padgett Bf Ten­
nessee, Talbott of Maryland, and But­
ler of Pennsylvania, the ranking Re­
publican member who talks a great
deal of "pacifism" for the benefit of
the Quakers and farmers in his dis­
trict but always votes "big navy."
When this committee has agreed on
a bill, it will have to pass both
houses and be signed by the presi­
dent. Conference bills are frequently

Revolution Brought About In
Industrial Conditions In State
of Wisconsin.
MADISON, Wis., Aug. 3.—The an­
nual report of the Wisconsin Indus­
trial commission marks the end of
the first five years under workmen's
compensation in Wisconsin industry.
The figures will tell, even though in a
somewhat colorless manner, the story
of one of the great economic revo­
lutions in American history, since it
has been brought about 'in the brief
span of half a decade..
Change of View,
Just five years ago the great ma­
jority of Wisconsin employers were
"fighting mad" because the legisla­
ture had passed the workmen's com­
pensation act. They, called it an in­
dustrial outrage they predicted a
state of anarchy and overwhelming
disaster to the state's industries and
insisted that Wisconsin's industries
could no longer compete with com­
petitors in other states. Meanwhile
the Wall stret insurance companies
pitched into the fight with renewed
vigor. They boosted their insurance
rates sky-high in efforts' to kill the
principles of workmen's compensa­
tion,
But five years have brought a great
change. Wisconsin's industries lare
more prosperous than ever before
anarchy is a stranger to the state
the insurance. companies are making
money on rates that are a fraction
of what they formerly were. The
employers who saw red at the men­
tion of compensation are now doing
the square thing by injured employes
of their departments. The old argu­
ment that the economic balance be­
tween competing states would be de­
stroyed an.d that cobwebs would
cover Wisconsin industries has been
disprover. Every other industrial
state* in the union has adopter the
workmen's compensation principle.
They followed Wisconsin's lead.
American industry is on a new basis.
And this new basis has been estab­
lished in the astonishingly brief period
of'five years.
What Has Been Done.
The 1916 report will show that in­
jured employes and the dependents of
men killed in industry since 1914, -have,
been paid in evcess of $3,000,000 in
compensation, in the five years pre
eding 1911 a scant $600,000 was paid
and much of this sum went not to
the injured persons but to lawyers,
doctors, ambulance chasers and
others. The cost to the state through
court proceedings was stupendous.
Labor was antagonized because it did
not get a square deal.
The Wisconsin compensation act
was drafted by a special committee
appointed by the 1909 legislature. This
committee worked through 1909 and
1910. The members were Senators
A.W. Sanborn, E. T. Fairchild, J. J.
Blaine Assemblymen Wallace In
galls, C. B. Culbertson, G. G. Brew,
Walter Egan, the latter of Superior!
now deceased. P. 7. Watrous was
secretary. A. T. Van Scoy as repre­
sentative of the employers' interests,
and Fred Brockhausen as representa­
tive of the workmen's interests, sat
with the committee on all occasions
and assisted in the drafting of the
law. Harry L. Butler was counsel.
Prof. John R. Commons and Reuben
McKittrick assisted the committee as
economist and in drafting bills in
accordance with the committee's in.
structions. So successful was the
committee's work that many other
states have copied large parts of the
Wisconsin law.
BLACKLIST IN TRENTON.
TRENTON, N. J., Aug. 3.—The
Trades Union Advocate urges rubber
workers to organize to defeat a black­
list enforced in this industry. It is
charged that a worker cannot secure
employment without the consent of
the employer he left.

By GEORGE P. WEST.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.—While
every big special interest newspaper
and every jingoist in the country has
been shouting for war with Mexico,
five official representatives of the
Mexican labor movement have been
meeting with the executive council
of the American Federation of Labor
in complete harmony and friendship.
At the federation headquarters in
Washington, the common interests of
the peoples of the United States and
bf Mexico are being emphasized in
the conferences that are proceeding
with a view to removing: misunder­
standings a!nd preventing war.
The' Washington. meeting are his­
toric as being the most effective ef­
fort ever made by the workers of two
countries to avoid war. Mexican del­
egates to the conference are in close
touch with First Chief Carranza, while
American labor through President
Gompers is making its wishes, known
to the American administration.
The Mexican labor representatives
include Carlos Lovera, Baltazar Pages,
Luis Morones, Salvador Gonzalo Gar­
cia and Col. Edmund 'Martinez. They
are here at the invitation of President
Gompers.
Women and children will join with
the men of Mexico in resisting Ameri­
can occupation, the Mexican delegates
told Washington newspaper corres­
pondents who had asked what would
happen if the American trrops are
not withdrawn.
The interview was.
arranged In the
office of the Committee -on Industrial
Relations by Lincoln.Stiffens, who led
the questioning with a view to bring­
ing out the attitude,^ the, Mexican
people.. .' '.
Represents 100,000 Men.
"We represent 60 Mexican labor
unions with a membership of 100,000,"
said Carlos Lovera, of Yucatan, and
chief spokesman for the Mexicans,
we shall have to go to war when we
"We realize that it is quite possible
we shall have to go to war when we
have no quarrel, and we are here to
do what we can to prevent it. It may
be that we shall fail, just as labor
failed in Europe.
"Since we arrived here we have
learned that the American people do
not want war, and especially the
working people. To a certain extent
we can carry that news to the Mexi­
cans and give them that impression,
that the American people have no
quarrel with us and do not want
war. We believe the trouble is made
by the special interests, and not by
the people.
"Mr. Carranza does not want war,
nor do the men around him.
"As far as we know, we don't think
there is anyone in Mexico that wants
war.
"Labor and the government of Mex­
ico are working together. The gov­
ernment recognizes us, and the labor
movement agrees to help the Consti­
tutionalist revolution. We had regi­
ments in the field, under our own
offieers. They were called the 'red
battalions.*
"When we have a big strike how,
the military does not help the em­
ployers. They do not interfere, they
do not help us, but they leave us
free to use the strike weapon. The
government of Yucatan is helping all
they can. We. have the eight-hour
day and the English week of 44 hours.
We quit work at 11 o'clock on Satur­
day morning and are paid for the full
day.
"On the day we left Mexico, we had
the first actual distribution of land in
Yucatan."
The Mexican delegates were told
priates $315,000,000 for 1917 of which
$110,000,000 is for new construction.
And as if this were not enough to
wave before a war-torn world, the
senate bill authorizes appropriations
for the next three years amounting to
$588,000,000.
Great Britain's expenditures for her
navy, under her two-power standard
are in the neighborhood of $266,000,
000 a year. But if this bill of ours
goes through, Great Britain will have
to double her naval budget to keep
ahead of us. It i$ this which prompts
many to predict that she will be
driven to pick a fight with us in a
few years in order to prevent the
load from getting too heavy.
Its Imperialistic Character.
In its emphasis upon dreadnaughts
and battleships and its Indifference to
submarines, the' senate bill is thor­
oughly imperialistic. The Deutsch
land may be'a nine-days' wonder and
the fighting submarine may, as it did
in the North Sea, drive the battle­
ships in flight before it, but the sub­
marine doesn't greatly Interest the
senate. It is not aggressive enough.
The submarine can not collect debts
it can not "demonstrate" before
a:
sullen people and wrest concessions,
from them it doesn't cost enough to

Vast Sums Are Being Spent to
Keep Back Eight-Hour
Ruling.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 3.——Any­
thing for delay is the plan of the rail­
roads in dealing with the demand of
the employes for an eight-hour day,
is charged in a statement issued by
the Transportation Brotherhoods.
Railroads are spending hundreds of
thousands, of dollars to ask the public
for their support on a proposition to
refer the controversy to the Inter­
state Commerce Commission.
The public should know that the
interstate commerce commission
only very recently and on two differ­
ent occasions, have reported at some
length and in considerable detail upon
this very question. Its reports com­
prehend two widespread investiga­
tions since 1910, and are the result of
attempts on the part of the railroads
to make "use of increases in wages to
induce the commission to give its con­
sent to increases in freight rates.
The whole subject of wages was
gone into by the" commission with
much care and in great detail.
The railways were fully represented
by counsel and large numbers of wit­
nesses 'testified "Mr their bfehalf.
Eminent" counsel appeared in" "be­
half of the opposition to the roads.
The attorney of the commission
also participated in" the proceedings
and prepared and presented for" con­
sideration, a great mass of statistical
information.
After a full hearing of the investit
gation upon all the. facts and cir­
cumstances, the commission held that
there was no evidence before it which
established the necessity for high
rates.
And again In 1914 the same elabor­
ate and thorough investigation into
the subject of wages as having a
bearing on the necessity for increased
rates, .was held.
This federal tribunal said, "it is in­
teresting to note, that notwithstand­
ing wages constitute a large part of
the transportation expense, this item
of expense has shown a relatively
small advance as compared with other,
groups."
The commission called" attention to
the fact that efficiency of operation
and management are the most im­
portant things In the reduction of
operating expenses, and, as an illus­
tration, the commission cited the
statement of the general superintend­
ent of motive power of the Pennsyl­
vania railroad who lessened the cost
of building locomotives between 1903
"and 1913, although the rate of wages
increased nearly 40 per cent.
The' official utterances of the in­
terstate commerce commission answer
authoritatively, questions raised by
the railroads in their opposition to
the present movement of the railway
brotherhoods for an eight-hour work
day for employes in freight train
service.
TWO VICIOUS INJUNCTIONS
DETROIT. Mich., Aug. 4.—Striking
pattern makers have been enjoined
from publishing advertisements in
any newspaper that a strike exists in
this city or warning" pattern makers
away from Detroit or from the em­
ployment of plaintiffs.
Another injunction issued against
the Carpenters' District Council, orders
the unionists to cease depriving "the
Walbridge-Aldinger. company of the
free use and enjoyment of its prop­
erty." ...
This statement by the honorable
court should remove any doubts from
those people who insist that injunc­
tion judges do not consider labor
property, and who fail to see that if
an injunction judge does not take this
position he cannot justify the injunc­
tion process in strike times.
COURT ORDER DISSOLVED
Bellaire, Ohio. Aug. 4—Judge Lynch
of the Belmont county court of com­
mon peace has dissovled a tempo­
rary restraining order issued by him
against striking employes of the Bel­
mont Casket Manufacturing company.
His '.honor "intimated that courts
possess^ wondrous reasoning power in
their attempt', tri deny strikers con­
stitutional guarantees through the in­
junction process. He said:
"The opinions of the various courts
of the union in strike injunction cases
cover thousands of pages and it would
be an unwarranted task to attempt to
reconcile them. In fact, they can­
not all be reconciled."
This is the feature which most se­
riously impeaches (Mr. Wilson's pro­
fessed pacifism. "Good heavens!"
the pacifist may well exclaim, "it is
all very well to dissemble your love,
but why do you kick me down
stairs?"
This three year program means
that this congress is to dictate the
number of new ships to be laid down
within the next three years. Instead
of legislating for 1917, it legislates for
1917, 1918 and 1919. The next con­
gress will find its hands tied. The
war in Europe may be over and pub-,
lie opinion may demand that all new
construction shall cease, but congress
will find itself morally and legally
bound to see through, with the neces­
sary appropriations, the gigantic con­
tracts for which this administration
will have secured authority.
It may be urged that one congress
can not bind another. This is true*
in theory, but in practice each con­
gress is compelled to .carry, through,
the new construction authorized by
its predecessor. Nt to do Jk would

Ranks.
That Duluth union labor will have
the greatest labor day demonstration
in its history this, year- ia the plan
of the Duluth assembly, The matter
was discussed at the last meeting of
the labor assembly and tentative
plans made to arrange a program.
For the last fewryeitrs union labor
in Duluth has elimination the Labor
day parade, feeling that the money
necessary to stage such an event,
might better be used tor-some other
purpose. However, since the Labor
Forward Movement here last win­
ter, the union ranks have been aug­
mented and 'fully 1,000 new members
enlisted. •With the various new un­
ions and the increased numbers in
other unions, it is expected that the
demonstration will be the greatest
ever .staged in Duluth by union labor.
Further plans will be discussed at
the meeting of the assembly.
ANTI-UNIONISTS
DO WAR DANCE
DETROIT, Mich.f Aug. 3.—Every
anti-unionist in the state is doing a
war dance because Organized labor
proposes to amend the state -constitu­
tion limiting the issuance of injunc­
tions inrlabor disputes.
Labor asks that the^principles em­
bodied in the Clayton law be placed
in the state constitution.' In reply to
this claim the antis present "argu­
ment" similar to the following from
Saturday Night, published in this

from a woman parishioner. He
preached a sermon on "The Tongue"
which so impressed his listeners that
200 pledged a.more kingly use of

The purpose of the league is to keep
persons from gossip, scandal, deceit,

each year of the necessity, for more

gress to authorize appropriations for.
the army for a period longer than
two, years. Thls fa because our fore­
fathers had heard of militarism and
were afraid to give any group'the
power tb build up' a huge standing
army. They had never heard of na
valism, so they .neglected to establish
a similar safeguard in the case of

TWO CENTS.
Fraudulent and Infamous Actions'
Charged to Rockefeller Men
In Colorado Elections
CLEAR EXPOSE MADE
BY SUPREME COURT,
Sheriff Jeff Parr and Whole Coal!
Company Crew Ordered to
Get Out.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.—"Fraud­
ulent and infamous prostitution of
the ballot" was resorted to at the1
last election by the Republican or-'
ganization of the Colorado coal'
fields in behalf of John D. Rocke­
feller's Colorado Fuel & Iron com*!
pany. This is the latest charge
brought against the men who "put
over" Governor George Carlson,
Sheriff Jeff Farr, and the other
"Law and Order" candidates whoi
succeeded in the last election.
Who charges it?
Frank P. Walsh?
Guess again.
The supreme court of the state of
Colorado! I
Court Ousts Whole Gang. 1
In a decisoin that' confirms all
Walsh said about the corrupt meth­
ods of the Rockefeller company, the
highest court in the state orders
Sheriff Jeff Farr and all his coal
company crew to step down and out
and turn over their stolen offices to
their Democratic opponents.
The same "infamous and fraudu­
lent prostitution of the ballot" that
gafve Farr his bogus election also
swelled the plurality of Carlson, the
coal company governor now in office.
But because the case at bar con­
cerned only the result in Huerfano
countjr, Carlson is left undisturbed.
The decision and opinion just
handed down by the Colorado su­
preme court constitutes an amaning
expose of high-handed intimidation,
coercion and corruption practised by
the coal company and the Republi­
cs, party. JTfee court find, jthft
coal company was ihsRejrablicaa
party, and- that party's, candidates
merely the servile tools used by' the
company to rivet the chains of Indus,
trial tyranny on its employes.
"There can be," says the court, re­
ferring to conditions proved to exist
in the Colorado «oal fields, "no free
open and fair election- as contem­
plated by the constitution, where pri­
vate industrial corporations so
throttle public opinion, deny the free
exercise of choice by sovereign elect­
ors, dictate and control all election
officers, prohibit public discussion of
public questions, and Imperially
command what citizens may and
what citizens may not, peacefully
and for lawful purposes, enter upon
election, or public territory."
Every act of corruption described
by the supreme court was committed
late in the year 1914, after the date
when Rockefeller's agents had sworn
that political activity had ceased,
and after John D. Rockefeller had
practically assumed personal charge
by sending Mackenzie King to Col­
orado and had formulated his much
advertised Colorado plan.
They were committed^ says the
court, long after all disorder had
ceased, and when the federal troops
were in charge of the district.
To corroborate its findings, the
supreme court Quotes the admissions*
of E. H. Weitzel, highest field offi-j
cer for Rockefeller, wh* -personally
ordered the Democratic candidates
kept out of the eight closed precincts!
on the ground that they were agitat-!
ors!
Court Findings 'Corroborated.
The whole case is summed up byi
the court as follows:
"We are unable to find a precedent'
where like, or similar condition*]
have been considered as in this castt
wherein private corporations 'have
assumed to ^eny the public character
of an election and to arbitrarily take
charge of and conduct the same as if
Coattancd ow P»p g.
succeeds, the jingoes will next at­
tempt a full five year program (that
is what this one was originally until
the' house rebelled) and some day
they may emulate the German em­
peror, who has blocked the pacifists
and. the socialists of Germany with
twenty year program. This, by the
way, is the only other example in the
world!
Summary.
The real battle Is now In the

of representatives. Write or
.wire your congressman your views
on the two billa. Tell hint to stlcfc
out for the house bill. Wire the Presi­
dent what you think of the three
year program.
Remember, this is a presidential,
year and no candidate is indifferent
to your views. There is a general
election on and a good many of -the
