Drove Germans Out of Thiaumont
for a While
RUSSIANS ARE DRIVEN BACK
After Fierce Fighting Are Compelled
to Retire From Advance on
Kovel.
London) Aug. 5. Verdun, almost
quiescent during the Anglo-French op
erations In the Somme region, has
again become the storm center on the
western battle front. The French
forces have taken the offensive on
the right bank of the Meuse and now
hold the Thiaumont work and the
greater part of the village of Fleury ac
cording to Paris.
The Thiaumont work, already
the scene of many desperate combatas
was twice in French hands during L2
hours yesterday. The forces Ot the
German Crown prince fought tenaci
ously, driving the French from the
work once, but losing it again. Ger
man counter-attacks were of no avail
says Paris, and the work remained In
the possession of the French.
Fleury, which changed hands Thurs
day after the French had succeeded
In taking it. Is again almost entirely
occupied by the French. Fierce light
ing still continues in and around the
village. German unwounded pris
oners taken In the Verdun lighting
number 400.
On the Somme front, in northern
Franch, there has been little infantry
activity, both the British and French
official communications failing to re
port any moves on the part of their ar
mies. London says the Germans bom
barded the section southeast of Poz
ieres, and also the southern portion
of the Manietz wood.
Desperate counterattacks by
the Germans in the region of the Stok-
hod river, east of Kovel, have result-
d In the retirement of the Russian
forces which had seized the village of
tudka Mlrvansknia. The fact that
the village is only IS miles from Ko
vel, the Russian objective on this part
of the olhynian front, probably ac
counts for the Intensity of the lighting
there.
The Russian Gen. Suakharnffs
troops continue to advance south of
Brady and toward I.embcrg. Petro-
gratl reports the capture of 1800 An
tro-Gerinans In a ' hot attack' on the

London, Aug. 4. Russian troops
which crossed Hie Stokhod on the line
of the Kovel Sarny Railroad a few
days ago advanced yesterdav to the
Stavok River, a left tributary Of the
StOkbod. where a terrific battle Is in
progiess for the village of Rutlka-
Mirynskala, nineteen miles from Ko
vel. After It had changed hands sev
eral times the Germans during the
night lorced the Russians to evacuate
it.
An Idea of the desperate character
of tli lighting here Is given bv two of
ficial erports. The first one, given
out by the Wur Office this morning,
said:
On the River Stavok. a lelt tributary
of the Stokhod. our detachments
fought their way to the river. Where
an obstinate engagement took place
for the village of Uudka-Mlrvnskula.
Bayonet lighting took place in the
streets, and, although liio village
changed hands several times, it finally
remained in our possession. All enemy
attempts to dislodge us ended in fail
ure. The enemy was forced back be

APPLES WITH PEDIGREES
One of the Aims of the Experiment
Station nt Burlington.
Burlington, Aug. 5. Is there such a
thing as a bredded apple tree, the
same as a bredded cow or horse?
That is one of the big questions which
M. B. Oummlngs, professor of horti
culture in the College of Agriculture,
is tackling; and its answer will mean
not only a Step along toward the so
lution of the moot problem Whether
individual variations exist in any one
species of fruit, but It will help Ver
mont fruit men to Improve their or
chards. '
Already some results have been ob
tained at the experiment farm which
the department conducts. But some
more of that later. Hubbard squash
Is the thing of immediate practical in
terest. "The idea Is to discover how
far We can modify and control the
quality and quantity," said Professor
Cuinmlngs. The squashes are blos
soming well and give hope of being
irec from that "sloshy," wet quality
which Is so common in many kinds of
squash raised in Vermont and else
where. "By seed selection we can In
crease or decrease the yield," he ex
plained. .
Strawberries is a fruit which the sta
Hon is experimenting with. Mr. Cuin
mlngs and his aids are breeding "with
reference to developing a strain per
fect in legard to productivity." Al
ready some results are being arrived
at. Vermont soil Is pretty well adapt
ed for their culsoil is pretty well
atlapted for their culture, as Barling
tculans at least know, ami a measure
of success seems in sight.
Hut apples. What's the matter with
Veimont apples, you ask? Well,
there's something the matter with al
most everything, and tin? College of
Agriculture Is trying to find out what
that something Is In each case. "Scion
selection experiments" is the phrase
the professor uses, expressing as it
were the 'first family' attribute which
a Bpecies of apples may have. In his
own words: "We are trying to tlud
out whether absolutely It puys to se
lect grafting wood from tho highest
yielding and best colored parent trees
or whether one may select promiscu
ously from trees regardless of their
qualityan d yielding propensities."
With cattle there is Known to lie
such a thing as pedigree, and Ver
mont's horses ami cattle, too, have
made anmes for themselves all over
the Union. Put trees, have they thai
sort of "good blood'' in their veins?
"It Is assumed by many niiiveynicn.
says the professor, that there is a
value in pedigree culture. Tola has
not been established with fruit trees.
It has been established with regard
to some farm crops, but not with or
chard crops."
Year after year, summer In and
summer out. and lull after fall, for six-
years the winkers at the station have
been scrutinizing those tirera. w
they are getting some results from
their long watching ami waltinu For-
tv trees are on trial ami a lew In each
neiiua in seven tmiereui varieties are
now beginning to do something on
their own account. All are of coin ;

VERMONT'S FORWARD MOVE
New Hampshire Newspaper Holds Up
State System as Model.
The possibilities of the revived
New Hampshire Hoard of Trade may
be Judged by an Investigation of the
accomplishments of similar organiza
tions in other states. We do not have
to go far from home for an example
Across the Connecticut we And the
Greater Vermont association, says the
Manchester. N. 11., Union.
This association is still young, but
its growth in strength and importance
tot he state of Vermont has been
astonishing.
Thi! big men of Vermont, such men
ub Theodore N. Vail or James Hark
ncss or Governor Gates, believe it to
be one of the most powerful forces
for Vermont development und they
are actively Interested in it.
A few years ago, Vermont communi
ties were almost entirely unorganized.
Today, Vermont communities are or
ganized for efficiency. The Greater
Vermont association has been the
needed stimulus; it has advised and
managed many organizing efforts; It
has watched over the new orgagniza
Hon continually, often almost compell
ing it to be efficient and active.
Some of the Vermont "slogans"
show the nature of the work under
taken. "An agricultural adviser for
every Vermont county" has brought
the county agent with his expert ad
vice and demonstrations to every far
mer in Vermont, and from a state
without county agents, Vermont has
now passed New Hampshire.
"A Vermont National Guurd in keep
lug with the best military traditions
ol Vermont" was translated last wint
er into military meetings all over Ver
mont, which stimulated recruiting
and interest in the welfare of the com
panies, in May. with the co-operation
of the business men of each com
munity, who furnished automobiles
and auto trucks, the Vermont regi
ment was mobilised in a day at North
field. Result: The Vermont troops,
well equipped and with full companies,

"Vermont highways the best gravel
nails in the United States. I'he

ture gullery of Vermont scenery."
"Every hotel table a display counter
of the best of Vermont agricultural
product."
Already the ext client gravel roads,
the delightful views exhibited in Ver-
, mont hotels nml Vermont maple syrup
on Hotel tables are making the Green
Mountains more formidable ns a rival
of the White Mountains and the Perk-
shires during the vacation season.
the Greater ormont association Is
a very modest example of state organ
Izations all over the country. Jf these
organizations are so Valuable to other
States, why not In New Hampshire?
Hie union is firmly of the belief that
the near future will witness tangible
results of the revival and Incorpora
inn oi I in- .ovv I amiis i re loan of
I Trade: and that the only more remote
si future will see increased nnd ever-
increasing results, to the benefit of
the state and of all its people. The
possibilities are presnt, anyway. Tin
ouject is to make the very most of
those possibilities. We confidently

Paris. Aug. 3. (Jiant German bi
planes, it was oflieially announced by
the French War Department today,
are a myth. The statement adds:
"It is certain, however, that Ger
many has built biplanes of an excep
tional size and power to be used as
hydroaeroplanes. One of these Is 75
feet across, with 4 motors, and able to
carry 0 passengers. Another, 137
feet across, with ." motors of fOfj
horse-power each, is said to have been
constructed at FYiediichshaven ami to
have flown over Lake Constance. If
so. these experiments must have hud
bad results, for the machine has been
met nowhere on the battle front.
"Aircraft of great power in service
on the land front are the two motored
aeroplanes. Oue Is the avlatic type,
78 feet across. It is steered by three
rudders.' It has places lor an observ
er or a gunner and a machine gun be
hind the pilot ami for another gun
flrcr on the bulcony behind the pilot.
The other type is of a similar model,
but more rapid in flight. The motors
in these aeroplanes are of "110 horse
power."
