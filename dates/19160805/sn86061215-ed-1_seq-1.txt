The Koelnlsche Volks Zeitung says:
"Germany's confidence in her army
leaders in the east was never shaken,
but the appointment of Von Hinden
burg increases this confidence to cer
tainty."

TO HER FATHER
Constance Hope Winters Is
Turned Over to Parent
By Court's Order
RULING EXCEPTED TO
BY YOUNGSTER'S AUNT
Constance Hope Winters has been
given into the care and custody of her
father, Nicholas Winters.
At the conclusion of the habeas cor
pus hearing late Thursday afternoon
District Judge Cornell so ruled and
the sheriff took the child from the
home of her aunt, Miss Ella Buchanan,
to her father that night in accordance
with the court's orders.
Thus has been settled by court
action a matter which, according to
evidence given on the stand during
the trial, has been pending for many
months. Three years ago last April
when Mrs. Winters, mother of the
child, died,,the litle one was taken
care of by Miss Buchanan, who is
Mrs Winters' sister. Her side of the
case introduced testimony to show
that the premature birth of the child
and the mother's death within three
days produced a very delicate state of
health for the youngster. Miss Bu
chanan, who is a nurse, had witnesses
to show that she had given the little
one the best of care and had sustained
her life by careful methods.
The court appointed a commission
of physicians to examine the child and
these men reported the next day, after
their appointment, that they had found
her to be healthy and normal. The
neighbors and friends of the Winters
family went on the stand and told the
court that as far as they knew Mr.
Winters was able and capable of tak
ing care of his child.
The ruling, made immediately after
the close of the arguments, read, "Tlie
court finds the defendant a proper per
son to have the care, custody and con
trol of the child and directs the sheriff
to turn her over to the defendant at
once. The writ of habeas corpus Is
hereby dissolved." All of the order
was excepted to by Miss Buchanan.
