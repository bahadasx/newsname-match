Station is being cut on the 950

as It is completed the Merger pump

will be dewatered to the 1006 point,
where the flow was encountered. The
pump has a capacity of 160 gallons a

One of the miners in the shaft tells
vividly how the flow was struck. He
narrated: "I told my partner we
would drill a corner hole next. 1
felt we would get the water channel
soon. The rocks were sweating and
the formation looked like true wall.
I got the hole in three feet and then
it happened. We hurriedly disman
tled the machine as the water started
to spurt through the hollow core of
the drill, which is still in the hole.
It came out in a regular cascade and
then it began pouring out of the
crevices. We salvaged the machine
and drills, but by the time this was
done and we signaled to hoist, the
water was up to our waists. If we
didn't drill into the casing of the
Murray vein I miss my guess."

The Republican strictures on the
administration Mexican policy, Lewis
denounced as "treasonable" and
charged that the clause in the Repub
lican platform favoring Interference
with the internal affairs of Mexico
was responsible for the massacre of
troops at Carrizal.
"Not until the captains of the Re
publican party shot at the president
of the United States did Mexican
outlaws shoot at the soldiers of the
American president," he said.
The platform declaration Lewis
characterized as a "summons to
Carranza and Villa to revenge the
entrance of American soldiers into
Me.cico and the Interference of
Americans with her Internal attain."
"It was the Republican convention
that slew tbe soldiers at Carrizal,
Lewis declared vehemently.
Senator Fall, Republican, said he
would like to spend every cent of
the Republican campaign funds to
mail Lewis' address over the country.
"I have just listened to the most
remarkable harangue the like which
I never did hear on the stump and
which I never expected to hear In

Tokio, August 5. Strikes of pu
pils against their teachers constitute
a feature of modern Japan which is
giving the educational authorities
considerable concern. Previously
peacefuly revolts of students were
confined to tbe medical schools, but
latterly they have extended to the
middle schools, which correspond to
the high schools of the United States.
Tbe strikes are usually due to the
pupils' objection to the transfer of a
favorite teacher or to their dislike of
a new teacher. Ordinarily the inci
dent is closed up by the temporary
suspension of the students. This
makes them surrender, as they fear
dismissal which would ruin their
careers in business or professional
life. . ..
A recent strike occurred In Ttka
oka, northern Japan, where all the
fourth and fifth year students, num
bering more thau 200, went on a
strike because they were not satisfied
with the head master.

OMAHA. August 6. Former Sena

A campaign of development has
been undertaken by the Gypsy Queen
Mining company which entails the
installation of about a carload of
machinery, a portion of which is
already at the mine and the balance
has been delivered at the depot.
Tbe shaft Is now 1470 feet deep
and will be sent down a great dis
tance, the exact footage not being
yet given out, but will be determined
by the water flow and the formation.
At all events, a station will' be cut
at the 1500 foot point and a crosscut
run to the vein which was encoun
tered in the shaft below the 1200,
which was picked up in a crosscut
on the 1350 and followed in a winze
from that level on a clearly defined
body of commercial ore, until the
miners were driven out by water.
The new installation includes a
seml-Deisel Internal combustion fuel
oil engine of the latest pattern. It
has a capacity of 50 horsepower with
a very moderate combustion of fuel.
In fact. It is said to be one of the
cheapest powers possibly obtained
In a desert region. The engine was
purchased through and is being in
stalled by Campbell & Kelly. This
engine will be used to drive the new
compressor. The latter machine is
now at the depot and will be taken
to the mine tomorrow. It is capable
of delivering 350 cubic feet of com
pressed air a minute to the drills. It
cannot be exactly computed how
many drills can be run with this ma
chine, because compression Is more
difficult here than at sea level, but
the management expects to get serv
ice for about six drills.
In addition there is installed a
three drill, electrically driven com
pressor which may be used as an
auxiliary or put in commission if
there should be any stoppage of the

LEADER OF WAR
( Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
PETROGRAD, August 5. Gen.
Alexis Brussiloff, commander of the
Russian army which swept through
Bukowina, was little known outside
of Russia before the present war.
In fact, it was not until 1914 that he
was given command of an army
corps. His work in the war won him
promotions. He is almost the only
one of the many prominent social
figures In the army who has made
good.
Gen. Brussiloff is 63 years old,
but looks more like 45. He is alert
and modern. He has dark, steady,
searching eyes and nose with a high,
commanding curved bridge, and a
sqyjhre jaw. His hair is close cropped;
he wears a long thin grey moustach.
It was Gen. Brussiloq who com
manded an army in the first Carpa
thian campaign when the Russians
were ready to pour down into Hun
gary, but were forced to retreat for
lack of ammunition. Unlike many
Russian generals, Brussiloff had the
advantages of an excellent education
and began army life in a fashionable
cavalry regiment. Ability and lntlu
ence combined to make his advance
ment rapid, lie held many positions,
was recognized a favorlto at court.
distinguished himself as a daring
rider, encouraged cavalry officers to
go in for polo and croBS country
steeplechases and was popular In

war to try out the capacity and char

officer who came to the front and

OFFICERS OF STEAMSHIP
BEAR STANO 8USPENOED
(Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
LONDON, August 5. London so
ciety has been stirred by the revela
tion that some ot its titled and most
prominent members have unwittingly
been lending their names to fraudu
lent war charity organizations.
Following close on tbe heels of the
report the founder ot a war fund was
arrested, speedily convicted and sen
tenced to six months' imprisonment
at hard labor for converting Its
money to his own use. In passing
sentence the court condemned widely
known persons who had allowed their
names to be used on "dummy com
mittees." Rumors that all was not straight in
the affairs of many of the "charity"
organizations which have sprung up
since the outbreak of. the war were
heard early this year and resulted in
the appointment of the committee.
The report, for instance, refers to one
charity that published no accounts, to
another with a merely nominal com
mittee, to a third whose balance
sheets failed to account for a quarter
of a million dollars, to a fourth
started by an undischarged bankrupt,
to a fifth that was the invention of a
foreign swindler. To all these the
public gave freely.
"The favorite dodge," says the re
port, "is really to expend the major
part ot the sum collected on the
nominal object of the charity and
only steal twenty or thirty thousand
pounds."
