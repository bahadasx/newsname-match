WASHINGTON, Aug. 4. Pur
chase by the United States of the
islands of SL Thomas, St. Crois
and St Johns, lying to the east
of Porto Rico and comprising an
archipelago known as the Danish
West Indies, is provided for in a
treaty signed today by the Unit
ed States and Denmark.
It will be submitted at once to the
Tnited States Senate and the Danish
Parliament, whose ratifications are
necessary to complete the purchase
agreement

No serfjus opposition Is expecte!
in the Senate, where action will e
sought at the present session. Since
the negotiations began, several months
aso. the foreign relations committee
has been in cPose touch with develop
ments and its members are under

their approval. Senator Lodge issued !
a statement tonight declaring the
arguments in favor of acquisition jf
the islands are unanswerable. The
only objection is expected to come
from senators who believe the pur
chase price 'of $25,000,000 to great
Danish Action Uncertain.
The outcome in the Danish par
liament is more uncertain, al
though little opposition is expect
ed there. It is recalled that a
similar purchase several years
ago was defeated in the Danish
parliament, attributed to German
interests.

Senator Lodge emphasized in
his statement tonight the possi
bility that the islands, if not ac
quired by the United States,
might fall into the hands of some
European power and involve this
government in difficulties under
the Monroe Doctrine, "which
might easily lead to war." a con

has been prominently before the
