W1TIIOI T IVTI M IDATIO.V
The strike vote was taken to-night
after the reply of the company to an
ultimatum from its employees had been
declared unsatisfactory. The report of
the negotiations was made by a com
mittee of six. which had been appointed
to confer with ?>en<ual Manager Frank
Hedley. The committee demanded the
right to organize without intimidation
- and a wage increase of from 3<"? to 33
cents an hour.
A letter received by the committee
from Mr. Hedley said he was "at all
times willing to meet the employees of
this "company," and that lie would be
glad to see the committeemen at his
office at noon to-morrow.
The meeting was attended by a dele
gation from the Central L.abor Federa
tion, representing 350.000 union men.
who pledged their moral and financial
support to the motormen and conduc
tors in their efforts to unionize. Tele

Prompt action was taken bv General
Manager Hedley to provide for emer

berger, chief inspector of police, that
a strike had been called on the lines
of the New York Railways Company.
Inspector Kchmittberger at once de
tailed men to guard tin: power-houses
and car barns of the company.
Uniformed policemen will be assigned
to every car, operated either by non
striking employees of the corporation j
or by strike-breakers.
If the surface-car strike order goes \
into full effect, all Manhattan will be :
dependent for transportation to - j
morrow upon the subway and elevated ;
lines, already crowded to suffocation ,
In rush hours. The number of persons
who travel to and from their work
upon the surface car lines has been
estimated at 1,500,000. liven a small
percentage of these passengers, if
forced to ride upon the overhead or j
underground trains, will seriously dis

Secretary Baker Asks Conferees
to Hold Up Army Appro

HAS SUPPORT OF WILSON
Measure Would Exempt Retired
Officers and Men From Mili

WASHINGTON*. August 4.?Secretary
of War Baker, with the support, it is
understood, of President Wilson, has
I urgently requested the Senate and
House conferees on the army appropria
tion bill to reconsider their decision ac
cepting Representative Hay's amend
ment to the revised articles of war.
which would exempt from the military
criminal code officers and enlisted men
j on the retired list.
I Kull agreement on the hill, it was
|learned to-day, had been reached by
the conferees, and a report had been
signed when the War Department
brought such strong influences to bear
for a reconsideration of the Kay amend
ment that the report was held up.
Senate conferees are understood to
have accepted the amendment only as
| .t last report to save the revised articles
of war, badly needed because of Mex
ican operations, and assure their enact
ment at this session of Congress.
I hero now is no law under which
: the War Department has Jurisdiction
over criminal acts of army officers or
enlisted men committed on foreign
soil. Two cases already are pending in
Mexico. Troopers committed crimes
j for which they cannot be held by the
United States Army authorities." and
must be turned over to the Mexican
j civil authorities for trial.

advantage of disciplinary exemption to

I to-morrow to discuss the question

No radical cuts in the appropriations
: were made, although there were some

WASHINGTON, August 4.?Indica
tions to-night were that President
Wilson would appoint three commis
sioners within the next few days to !
meet a similar delegation already '
selected hy General Carranza to under- :
take settlement of the international j
difficulties arising from disturbed con
ditions along the Mexican border.
In a note, delivered ro the State I\e
partment to-day. General Carranza
named his commissioners, but did not
answer specifically the suggestion of
the Washington government for en
largement of the powers of the com
mission. It is believed, however, that
the reply is generally satisfactory, and j
that negotiations will proceed without i
delay.
It was expected to-night that Am
bassador Arredondo might begin to
morrow a further conference with
Acting Secretary Polk regarding the
time and place for the meeting. Mr. ?
Arredondo said to-day that either Old j
Point Comfort, Va., or Asbury Park.
N. J., probably would be selected as
the meeting place.
General Carranza says in his note
that the Mexican commissioners "pre- !
ferably" would discuss the three points
outlined in the Mexican commission of
July 11, which are withdrawal of'
American troops from Mexico, the
framing of a protocol to cover future
border operations, and an investigation
| of what interests have promoted border
( raids State Department officials are
understood to regard this as at least
leaving the way open for broader con
siderations such as they desire.
It is possible that in notifying the j
Mexican government of the appoint- !
ment of the American commissioners j
and the time and place of the confer- I
ence, Mr. Polk will indicate again that
the L'nited States expects the con- j
ferees to be free from the close limi
tations implied in the new Mexican
note, but will avoid any detailed ex
pression on that point. The commis
sion then would be left to map out its
own course, unless <?en'-ral Carranza
had some specific suggestion to offer.

Child Labor Bill
Is Under Attack
Senator Hardwick Charges Both
Parties With Playing Politics
in Proposed Legislation.
WASHINGTON, August 4.?Constitu
tional arguments for and against the
administration child-labor bill occu
pied the Senate to-day. Senator Borah.
Republican. maintaining: that Congress
nas ample authority to exclude prod
ucts of child labor from interstate
and foreign commerce and Senator
llardwick. Democrat, insisting that
Federal legislation of such a character
clearly is an infringement on the
rishts of the States.
Senator Borah asserted that the
measure merely carried out the recog
nized police power of Congress over
interstate commerec. It must be con
ceded. he said, that there are some
things so bad that they must be de
nied the channels of interstate com
meree, and that a line must be drawn
somewhere. When it came to discrim
ination in such a matter.vhe argued, it
could not be left to the States, and
must necessarily fall upon Congress.
Senator Hardxvick charged both par
ties with "playing to political expe
diency" with child-labor legislation,
and said he felt ashamed because his
party had favored it in the St. Louis
platform. The bill, he declared, was
directed against a purely domestic and
internal affair, where regulation lay
in the sole power of the States. He
said he was earnestly in favor of Just
'and humane child-labor laws, but was
confident the Supreme Court would

! LONDON". August 4.?Verdun, almost
< quiescent during the Anglo-French
( offensive in the Somme region, has
again become the storm center on the
| western battle front. The French
forces have taken the offensive on the
I right bank of the Meuse, and now hold
j the. Thiauinont work and the greater
! part of the village of Fleury, accord
J ing to Paris.
The Thiaumont work, already tho
j scene of many desperate combats, was
1 twice In French hands during twelve
I
hours on Friday. The forces of the
German Crown Prince fought tenaci
ously! driving the French from the
work once, but losing it again. Ger
man counterattacks were of no avail,
says Paris, and the work remained in
the possession of the French.
| Fleury, which changed hands on
Thursday, after the French had suc
ceeded in taking it. is again almost
entirely occupied by the French.
Fierce fighting continues in and around
the village.

On the Somme from In Northern
France there has been little activity,
both the British anil French official
communications falling to report any
moves on the part of their armies.
British reports say the Germans bom
barded the section southwest of
l'ozieres, and also the southern portion
of the Mumetz wood.
RUSSIAN FOUCKS
COMPELLED TO RETIRE
? Desperate counterattacks by the Ger
mans in the region of tho Stokhod
River, east of Kovel. have resulted In
the retirement of the Russian forces
which had captured the village of
Rudka-Miryanskala.
The fact that the village is only
nineteen miles from Kovel. the Russian
objective on this part of the Volhynlan
front, probably accounts for the in
tensity of the lighting there.
The Russian General Sakharoft s
troops continue to advance south of
Brody and toward l.emberg. Petrograd
reports the capture of 1,3^0 Aus^i o
Gertnan troops in a "hot attack on
the line of the Sereth and Graberkl
Rivers.
A squadron of British na-val aero
planes has attacked with bombs Ger
man military establishments near Ghent,
Belgium. Tho London War Office
says considerable damage was done by
the dropping of two tons of bombs.
Unofficial reports received In Amster
dam apparently confirm this claim.
