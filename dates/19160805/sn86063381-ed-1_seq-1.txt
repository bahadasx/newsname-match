PROTECT GAME BIRDS
According to Carlos Avery, state
game and fish commissioner, 6,000
representative sportsmen of Minne
sota, besides all the game protective
associations in the state, have sent
to Washington vigorous protests
against proposed legislation relating
to water fowl. Dr. H. W. Henshaw,
chief of the biological survey, has
advised the commissioner that he be
lieved the protests would result in
modification of the bill to meet the
approval of the northwestern states.
The bill in question would establish
an open season from February 9 to
March 11 for ducks and other water
fowl in the states of Iowa, Illinois,
Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri, much
to the detriment, Mr. Avery said, of
duck hunting in Minnesota.
Petitions circulated in Bemidji
were signed by several hundred
sportsmen.

UNDER INVESTIGATION
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 5.Start-
ling disclosures may come with the
completion of an examination of the
financial affairs of Cass county,
which are now personally being
made by Public Examiner Fritz. Mr.
Fritz has been nearly two weeks on
the task and is still on the job. The
investigation is the result of charges
preferred with Governor Burnquist
by certain taxpayers in the county.
Cass county's troubles are similar
to those of Koochiching county, the
officials of which are also under fire.
The two counties have been bonded
to the limit for internal improve
ments and it is charged that money
realized through bond issues is ex
pended extravagantly.
Governor Burnquist and Public Ex
aminer Fritz are reluctant to talk
concerning the investigation of the
two counties. They say that many
of the charges made are not borne
out by the facts, but that the "disclos
ures may ultimately bring out some
thing under which the state prose
cuting officials can act.
