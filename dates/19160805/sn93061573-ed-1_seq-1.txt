G. C Smith Outlines Plun For lluud
ling Stale School Lands to Remove
Necessity oí Ever liming a Di
rect School Tax.
In a speech before the Old Settlers
at their picnic, Wednesday, (. C.
Smith availed the laxity of the land
Jaws of the slate and pointed out to
the assemblage the necessity of con
serving the state lands for the use of
actual settler and condemned the
present administration of the State
Land Ollice for a needless ineflici
oncy in the conduct of the ollice.
Mr. Smith pointed out that the
.thousands of acres of state land were
laying idle and bringing to the state,
in lease money, in inose cases, less
money than would accrue from tax
es. The lease money received from
ihts land and the moneys received
from its sale is hardly a drop in the
.bucket compared with the amount
that would be available under other
conditions, and - the money is not
bandied in a manner that will insure
a benefit from the lands to the com
ing generations.
His attack on the state land laws
was severe and to the point but he
did not critisize without offering a
remedy.
The remedy lays in the hands of
the voters. The people should send,
he believes representitives to the
state legislature who will work for
a repeal of the present lax land laws
and who will substitute such laws
as may be necessary to provide that
the money received from state lands,
either by sale, or lease, be kept in a
iund, the principal of which was in
violate for ordinary expenditure, but
which could be loaned to farmers
and actual settlers in the country,
who are improving the property or
bringing up the grade of the slock
run on the ranges, in sums ranging
from one thousand to five thousand
dollars, at a fair rate of interest.
"What we need," said Mr. Smith.
"an
and I think every man will aeree
ith me, is to limit the amount of
huid to be sold to one individual.
is compulsory for him to im
prove and resde upon this laud. See
that all money derived from all
.state land goes into a permanent en
dowment fund and that only the in
lerest is used; or better yet, provide
by legislation that all money re
ceived from the sale of state land
be loaned to farmers and stockmen
of the state on long time loans."
"The land appropriated for school
(' purposes alone is approximately 8,
000,000 acres. This land, if-sold at
the small sum of five dollars per acre
would bring a fund of $40,000,000.
This amount of money loaned out
in small and long time loans, say
in loans of $1,000 would be of great
est benefit to 40,000 men and women
who are trying to make homes in the
state and to add to the state's pro
sperity. At six per cent interest this
fund would earn $2,400,000 annually.
Accodring to government reports, in
1913, $700,010 was spent . to sup
port the schools of the state. Less
Miuji nan me sum ttiat would ae-
crue from the lands under the sys
tem outlined, and much of this was
derived by direjet taxation. How
much better, than, the outlined plan.
. Twice the money available, better
, schools, the best teachers, more
schools, and without direct tax upon
either those of you here or upon
your children."
k "Hut you say all' this land could
' not be sold. I admit that But even
if leased at the preposterous price
of live cents an acre the income
would be half enough to pay the
running expenses of the schools to
day, and as the land becomes more
valuable, and more of it is sold, as
is bound to be, the fund would grow,
and as it grew it would lower the
school tax until we could rest as
sured that our children would be
ii-eed from one burden of the tax pay
ers of older states where nothing
was done to conserve the resources
of the school."

l'ractically one-half of the State I
received no precipitation, or but a I
mere sprinkle, during the month,
and, with the exception of June, l',M)2,
iwhich had the same average pre
cipitation it was the driest June
of record. yCentral and western
counties were the driest, and only
a narrow strip along the eastern
border, including Union, eastern
Colfax, tuay and Curry counties,
equaled or exceeded tifo normal. In
these eastern counties, three brief
shower periods ocured ith to 0th:
llth to 12th, and 20th to 27th but
elsewhere light, scattered showers
on the Hh, and a few sprinkles there
after, constituted all that ocured.
There was almost an absence of rain
over the mountain areas, and forest
tires were frequent, but as a rule,
were small in area and Quickly con
trolled. No snowfall ocured, and no
extensive snow areas remained at
the close of the mouth.
The temperature averaged praet-
ically normal, although southern and
northwestern showed a deficiency,
the ith and 5th were generally the
coldest days of the month, and the
30 th the warmest, altho rather high
temperatures vere general after the
12th, barring a brief cool period on
the 20th.
The month proved very trying to
the dry farming, stock and range
districts. Some stock losses occured,
and ranges over the lower levels
of the State deteriorated rapidly.
The harvest of wheat was general
over eastern counties by the end of
Ihe second decade, and fair to good
yields were obtained in border coun
ties. The average precipitation for the
State, as determined from the re
cords of 171 stations, was O.iO inch,
or 0.7 1 inch below the normal, as
shown by the departures from 50
stations having records for ten years
or more. The average was 0.15 inch
below June, 11)15. The greatest
monthly amount was 3.85 inches at
lone, extreme couthern Union couny,
and the greatest in any 24 hours 2.30
iir-hes on the 12th at the same sta
tion. No precipitation occured at 58
stations, and but a trace at 2Í others.
There was an average of but one day
with 0.01 inch or more precipitation.
No snow occured.
The month was one of the clearest
experienced by the State in years;
there was an average af 23 days
which were clear, 6 partly cloudy,
and but one cloudy. At Santa Fe
lJ2 per cent of the possible sunshine
was recorded, or a total of 404 hours,
and there were 29 days with 50 per

You don't have to believe this un

ami it is enough to bar Ioe liuiiu

said to be true.
I oc ran short of llys and was

his recent fishing trip to. the Taos
country and tliat caused all the
trouble.
He was fishing one day with a
grasshopper on his hook and a trout
less than seven inches in a tin can
full of water in his creel when a
game warden spotted liiin.
"Catchin" any,'' asked the game
warden, politely, as they usually do.
"A few," answered 'Doc.
"Well, let's see "em," demanded
the game warden, not. quite so pol
itely, as usual, also.
"What's the smallest llsh you can
keep," asked the warden after eye
ing Doc's creel.
"Seven inches or over," answer
ed Doc.
"Why, then," demanded the ward
en, "have you got that four inch
trout in that tin can? You know bet
ter than to keep 'em that small!'
I know it; and 1 know its too
small," replied loc, geting sorter
mad, "but I'm going to keep him
right there until I get thru fishing

MAKE PIGS OF PIG (LIB MEM
BERS NON-ASSESSABLE IS
PLEA OF ISAACS
Let the Children Raise Their Pigs
Without Taxing Them And The
Interest in Hog Raising Will Be
Gained, 1 1 Believes.
Union County needs inore pig rais
ing. This point has been made by
the County Agriculturist. It is be-
I lieved by It. W. Isaacs the hardware
man, and Isaacs goes one further
and suggests a practical way in which
to encourage the raising of hogs. He
embodies the sugestión in his speech
at the Old Settlers picnic.
His idea is to have the pigs of the
children ot the county put in the
non-assessable class. The "Pig Club",
idea is sppeading all over the coun
try and the children, the young man
and the young woman of the form
are being encouraged to raie pigs by
the leadng farm journals and the
agricultural agents, everywhere. '
Mr. Isaacs believes that these pigs
should not he taxed. He believes
that the next legislature should pass
a law allowing any young man or
young woman, or old one, for that
matter, to raise ten pigs and their
litters free from taxation of any
character.
This he believes would increase
the swine industry of the state to a
wonderful extent.
In the same talk Mr. Isaacs urged
pome action ne laKeu hy the resi
dents or Union County to form a
company and to solicit state and
governmantal aid in sinking a test
well for oil. There is oil to the north
east, south and west of Unou coun
ty, and there is every reason to be
lieve that a test well in this county
would prove a gr. ut extent oí the
county underlain by mineral wealth
of such character.
It will be remembered in this con
nection that the same statement was
made by the President oí the State ;
School of Mines, who lectured on. the
Mineral Resources of the county
some few month ago.
