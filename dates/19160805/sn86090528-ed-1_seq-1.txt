Mrs. Nungester received of the unfor

I so as not to avail himself of the emer

the car after it jumped and rolled over.
It is generally conceded that the lives
of the two men In the front seat were
saved by the adjustable seats which

thus saving the occupants from being
crushed to death. ', .

Washington, August 5. Senator
Lewis, In a speech on the floor of the
senate today, charged the heads of the
Republican party with responsibility
for the loss of American lives in Mex
ico. He announced his speech to be
an answer to the Mexican issue raised
by former Justice Hughes in his ac
ceptance address.
Senator Lewis declared that Mexi
can bandits were encouraged to com
mit outrages on Americans because
Republican leaders, in their anxiety U
embarrass the president and create a
campaign issue, gave out the impres
sion that the country was not united
in support of the chief executive.
"Villa and other Mexican bandits,"
exclaimed Senator Lewis, "found their
allies in the loaders of the Republican
party. AU were for the destruction of
the American policy and the American
president.
"By the doctrine of law which holds
responsible those who set in motion

A solution to the problem with which

City officials declared to an Express
representative this morning that Ollia

County Attorney Vonnble agreed to
dismiss the case against OUie on the
charge of stealing silverware from th

"They've got mo started losing out
where I should have won," declared
Texas Tate this morning, "and now I
am going in to win or lose in a real
right. I shall either knock Hempel
out next Friday night or he'll whip mo
in five or six rounds. I know I have
pot that guy skinned to death and he
can't stay any ten rounds with me.
That was the rottenest deal I evor had
ii. my life at Ardmore last night."
The cause of the above explosion on
the part of the usually placid rising
young pugilist from Texas was
brought on by a discussion of the ton
round fight which was to have taken
place at Ardmore last night, but which
was declared to be a draw by the ref

mistakable foul on tho part of Hempel
In. the first round had been made. Not
withstanding Tate's claim of foul and
the declarations of many who Baw and

allow it but later admlttod In Tate's
room that he had made a mistake,
says Tate. The two principals arrang
