front these newer districts A
total of 505 wells were complet

which 422. or 7S per cent yieldei
usual yield averaged 568 barrels
24 hours after completion.
The total amount reported by the U.
S. Oeologi al Survey as having been
marketed from the northwestern Louis
iana fiehls amounted to 15.082.IM4 bar
rel* in 1915, an increase of 28 per cent
for this district over the 1"14 record,
^fhe maximum vield. exceeding a million
■ nd a half of barrels, was reached in
August, 1915, whi'e December had fal
len to a little under a million a quarter
barrels The average pri e received for
this oil at the oil wells was 62 cents a
barrels, a de rease of .'3 cents per barrel
from the price of 1914.
As the Louisiana sugar factoiies get
the bulk of their steam from the bagasse
they produce, it liai been found that
with excellent work, four gallons of fuel
oil per ton of cane, in addition to the
bagasse, will be sufficient to carry on
the sugar factory work. The saw mill
interests of the state are large consum
ers of steam and necessarily some kind of
fuel, but their fuel will be their own
sawdust and slabs, with a surplus
■ mount of fuel that they have to destroy
to get it out of the way.
The war demands have taken all th«
fuel oil and refined .oil that can be pro
duced, taking it a* rapidly as it is of
fered, so that the Standard Oil Co., with
it« great refinery and pipe lines at Ba
ton Rouge; the English corporation, with
its refinery now building at Destrehan
plantation in St.* Charles Pariah and the
local refinery in St. Bernard Pariah,
which will aoon be very largely increased
in its capacity, are all aiding in the de
veloping of the commerce of the state.
It looks very much aa though Louisiana

WILSON CRITICS.
The critica of Preaident Wilaon—and
they are both noiey and numeroue and
•one of them belonging to hia own
party—are having much to aay of an un
complimentary nature becauae the Met
kan queetion ia about to be solved
peacefully and without intervention or
the shedding of blood. Of course the
Hearta and allied intereats, that hav# ex
ploited Mexico and are seeking to have
their infirm titlea to vaat properties val
idated by our government, are behind
the movement. Aa waa expected, Roos
evelt has emitted a leonine roar that can
be heard acroaa the continent. Other
politiciana are openly aaaailing the prea
ident becauae he did not ruah hia troopa
{•to bloody conflict. These worthies
want war and carnage, although they
-retly refrain from putting on
khaki auit and going to the border. They
want Mexico invaded and, if necessary
the Mexican people exterminated, and
they care not a stiver how many young
American Uvea may be aacrified in this
ngly business It i* natural for the
American people to feel indignant and
hoetile to the Mexicans, snd the presi
dent would be applauded, for the time
being, if he would send our forces
against them. They think thst he has
procrastinated too much, and that the
time for acting haa arrived. Neverthe
less the sober second thought of the peo
ple will eustain and endorse President
Wilson if he succeeds in solving the
Mexican problem Withnut bloodshed.
The ignorant peons, who would be
slaughtered, are in no way to biamc, be
cause they are being blindly led bv un
principled scoundrels who are seeking
their own personal advantimr. Our
young men are too valuable an asset to
be killed by auch people in s ich i Mis
erable conflict, and if dirbmjcy can
bring about order anj tranquility, and
aave the lives of young Americans, that
diplomacy will be performing its most
exalted function. President Wilson csn
bide hia time and remain indifferent to
the temporary atorm of crticism thst is
•weeping over the country, confident in
the righteousness of his parpe*\ and
secere In the belief that the Amerl-an
people will applaad him.— Newa Scimi

London, Aug 2. Hoger Casement's so
licitor. Gavin Duffy of Dublin, had not
received word this morning of tatty
i-liang« 1 in the plans for the execution
by hanging at 9 o'clock Thursday morn
ing of his client at Pentonville prison.
Premier Asipiith had received an ex
tensively signed petition from Ireland
but beyond a formal acknowledgment he
had not further communicated with its
originators.
Casement, according to Solicitor
Dugv, who sees the condemned man fre
quently, remains unconcerned He no
longer looks dejected or depressed and
betrays no emotion as the hour for his
execution approaches. He eats well, fav
oring f ruit and iced drinks.
Casement Turns Catholic
After Conviction.
Gavin Duffy, counsel for the tonnet
knight, is responsible for the stalemenf
that (lie condemned matt has embraced
the Catholic religion since the passing
of fhe death sentence, he having rereiv»*d
instructions and daily ministrations from
a priest visiting his cell.
Mr Duffy declare«! also that prisoner
had now seen and bade farewell to his
nearer relatives, who called and spent
some time with hi mat the jail. The
doomed man is reported as unusually
cheerful, bearing himself as one uncon
cerned.
-4V.
THE CASEMENT EXECUTION.
In executing Sir Roger Casement, the
English Government adds another to the
blunders which have characterized it pol
icies in dealing with Ireland.
Of th e man's guilt, assuming his
mental responsibility, there can be no
doubt; snd no one who carefully fol
lowed the evidence given at the trial can
have the alightest ground for criticising
the righteousness of the verdit of the
fsirness with which the prisoner was
treated.
But the case was one which juatified
royal clemency to the extent .at least of
setting aside the sentence of capital pun
ishment; and that the clemency was not
extended merely proves that England
deals one way with Irish traitors and
another with traitors who are not lirah.
A completer case of treason in the
present wsr has not been presented than
that of Gen. DeWet and his fellow South
Africa n leaders, who also took the side
Of Germsny and succeeded where Sir
Roger failed in organizing a formidable
armed rebellion against the crown dur
ing some of the darkest days of the war.
But though Gen. DeWet alao was con
vicited, as justifiably as Sir Roger, and
aentenced to die, the English Govern
ment shrsnk from the risk of creating a
South African martyr and promptly
spsred Gen. DeWet's life.
In modifying the jury's verdit as to
Sir Roger, the English Government
would have had a n immediate precedent
to guide it, asid from the fact that already
it had ruthlessly shot an unnecessarily
large number of Irish rebels; but, ap
parently, it is incapable of dealing with
Ireland and Irishmen in the brosd
minded spirit which usually marks its
relations with its colonies and colonials
By the execution Englsnd gaina little
if anything and loses much. It has
msde a new Irish martyr and aroused
fresh enmities here. It wss stupidity
not to have avoided such conaequences
of its failure to treat Casement ss
did DeWet.—States.

FIEND SHOULD BE CAPTURED
If one half-breed deaperado can stall
an entire parish of people, as the m îr

the name of heaven could a dozen full
breeds do to our border boys? A heroic
stampede of official duty is the necessary
thing. It's well to be cautious, but tha:
fiend incarnat» should be captured ant
made the subject of torture without

The recent Louisiana legislature passed
three bills that directly affects the wo
men of the State. One of the lawe en

HORSES' TEETH SHOULD BE
EXAMINED REGULARLY.
Horses, like people, have trouble
with their teeth, and If the latter are
not examined periodically, and any de
fect present, corrected, had results
are likely to follow, especially through
Improper nourishment of the antmal
on account of imperfect mastication,
or chewing, of the food, and In some
Instances, actual starvation, a caae or
which the writer haa personally wit
nessed.
Hp to the time a horse has got all
of its adult, or permanent, teeth, or
when it is about four and one-half
years of age. the colt teeth are grad
ually being «lied to make way for the
permanent ones. In most cases the
change takes place naturally and with
out any trouble; hut occasionally a
young animal will be found with some
orlt teeth remaining that should have
been out to make nnom for the horse
teeth which are to replace them. Such
a condition may be Been in young
horsea or mules at any time until ail
of the colt teeth have disappeared
from the mouth, and the horse has a
full set of permanent one«, which, a*
we hfevi Just stated, ia about four and
one-half raftum old.«
Such lrr#gn\arltles of the teeth pre
vent youhg Mllttaala from Shewing their
food property, and Accounts, In such
cases, for th«fr l»oV of thrift and back
ward condition. Tha indications here,
ere that' youhg stock of this kind
should have their teeth reguiarlf ex
amlned at least on te a rear, and any
colt teeth found remaining, that may
be loose, or that may be Interfering
with the eruption of the older teeth,
removed from the mouth, either by the
Angers, or foroept If necessary, which
will generally give an animal a frseh
start on Its way to a more thrifty
condition. Older animals, also, re
quire to have their teeth periodically
looked after. With the constant
grinding of the food, even if the
grinding surfaces should remain sat
isfactory, the edges of the molar, or
bask teeth, sometimes become so
•harp as to cut and lacerate the
cheeks or wound the tongue, and in
tfels way prevent the animal from
shewing as It naturally should.
By looking Into thMhouth and ex
amining the upper an« lower grinders
of either side, it will be found that
It Is the outer edges of the upper ones
that are sharp and which Injure the
cheeks; and the Inner edges of the
lower teeth that are liable to wound
the tongue.
When this condition Is found, and
which would be Indicated by the an
Imal remaining thin, perhaps "quid
ding" its food, or whole grains being
passed In the manure, etc., the thing
to do would be to carefully file off
the line of sharp, rough edges.
It. should be stated, however, that
while the edges mentioned are natur
ally a little more prominent than the
other parts of the teeth, they should
not feel so sharp as to injure the
parts with which they come in con
tact—the excessive sharpness being
due more or less to constant grinding
when feeding.
More serious conditions occasionally
arise, which require the attention of
the expert, such, Tor example, as
where one or more teeth have been
knocked out, and the opposing ones
grow so long as to cut right Info the
gum. or even Into the bone. Or, in
the case of a diseased tooth that re
quires extraction.
However, by regular examinations
of the teeth and the simpler irreg
ularltles corrected at the time, the
more serious forms need nev*r occur.
We would recommend to those own
ing horses and mules, therefore, thst
they make It a regular practice of
pxamlnlng the teeth of their animals,
both before and after they get their
permanent or adult teeth. It is quite
aa Important matter.

GOAT RAISING IN ST. MARY
PARISH.
Mr. John M Caffery of the Columbia
Sugar Company, neat Franklin, lias pur
chased a car load of goats for propaga
tion on his farm in the Cypremont
country. Mr. Cacery has been converted
to the idea that raising goats »n the vast
uncultivated acros of St. Mary may ut
tinfately prove ap rofitable enterprise.
It is not commonly known that goats
serve an excellent purpose where farm
ers are engaged in clearing land, th
agile animals making good use of their
limbs in climbing all small trees, utiliz
ing the foliage for food purpose. Th
larger trees are not spared, while prac
tically all the undergrowth is kept down
throughout the season, when the number
of the herd ia commensurate with the
area covered. Mr. Caffery some weeks
ago purchased a car of goats from the
Avoca Island herd, where over 700 of the
animals are used for propagation pur
poaes and ior clearing land. The profita
derived from the goat industry arise out
of the rapid increase of the specie,
well as the benefits of their herbiverously
destructive nature. Goats sell for from
12.50 to $3.50 and their rapid increase
almost means the finding of this return
since their up-keep amounts to no more
than services required to herd the ani
mais.
The result of Mr. Caffery's experi
ment, and that now being carried on at
Avoca, is bein gwatched with interest by
those who are interested in acreage de
velopmenta in this section.— M. C. Newa
