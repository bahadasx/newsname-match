A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
yife are anxious to see that all lines owned by
I other partie 8 and connected with us are kept in such
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are responsible for their upkeep,
fe wan t to co-operate with them.
All lines require a thorough overeauling occa
| tonally if the best service is to be obtained. We
jocommend that every line connected with us be
orerhauled at least once a year, and that at least one
I experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
coot of this work when divided among all the patrons
ofthe line, makes the amount paid by each man
pull, and this cost will be more than offset by the
improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in this sec
tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We will gladly do
what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your line.
