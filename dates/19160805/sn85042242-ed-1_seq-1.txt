F*igo',Aug.
4.—iNot Idas than a half
million acres of grain were destroyed
by hail Thursday evening, while
wheat crops over a tremendous area
in northeastern North Dakota and
northwestern Minnesota, were laid
flat, most of it completely destroyed,
in the fiercest wind, rain, hail and
electric storm those sections have
known in years.
Estimates of the damage today are
varied, but the aggregate of losses
entailed runs into the millions of dol­
lars.
Two distinctive storm areas are de­
fined by reports that have been made
available today.
One of these storms covered Ram­
sey, Nelson, Grand Forks and portions
of Benson and Traill counties, in
North Dakota.
The other includes Polk, Kittson,
Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake (Falls,
Roseau, Mahnoman and 'Norman coun­
ties, in Minnesota.
Wheat production in the seven
northwestern Minnesota counties has
beqn reduced to practically nothing
by 'fth§ wind and rain, which drove the
grain into the ground.
}Jjp Trajtll county, and in portions of
Bjwpon a,nd 'Ramsey counties, Nprth
Dj^pta, two distinct hail storms clean
eijl^ bHween 400,000 and 500,000
acipes of\,grain that was just ready
for {he reapers.
No loss of life has been reported up
to the present time.
Two local cyclones Ate also report­
ed In the storm area, one cutting a
path through the outlying residence
district of Grand Forks, the other
passing through McVille, N. D. At
Grand 'Forks, the roof of one resi­
dence was carried 500 feet the base­
ball park bleachers and fences were
wrecked, barns torn down, while the
university campus is strewn with
broken trees.
The North Dakota storm had its in­
ception somewhere west of Devils
Lake, dividing, however. One branch
of this storm swept south through the
sd^hejHrT eii.d of Nelson county, across
the\notth^fesi'6rn cornef of Traill
county, and'back iiito southern Grand
Forkiq •'county. Ahpther branch of
this storm swt|ng ii'o^thwestward from
Leeds ?to Edmore, N. D., thence to­
wards® Grand Fork,s county, through
southwestern Walsh coilnty, and
thencg down to the city of Grand
Forks.
'Minnesota's storm originated near
the extreme northeast corner of {hat

its 'iiYtf* south of Ctbdkston.
HAILSTORM COVERED
300 SQUARE MILES
Portland, N. D., Aug. 4.—About 300
square miles, an area 20 miles long
and fifteen miles wide, was swept al­
most clean of crops by hail last night.
The district covered lies west, north
and east of Portland, this city lying
near the southwest corner of the
storm belt. Hatton also was within
the storm area. Nearly 200,000 acres
were hit by the hail.
Mail fell in tremendous quantities
and the storm is defined as "the worst
in 15 years." Hail stones about, the:
size of Alberts, fell in remarkable
number,. covering the ground, while
hailstones were ,picked up measuring
as much as eight inches, in circumfer­
ence—those, of course being the ex­
ception.
Heavy wind accompanied the.hail,
faiocking out windows and doing a
great amount of damage to' buildings
generally. There was no loss of life
or injury, so far as ,renorted.
The Anderson barn in this city was
hit by lightning and burned during
the wordt of the storm..

recruits be sent to Fort Snelling, mid­

than to Camp Lincoln, according to
Adjutant General T. Tharalson, who
returned yesterday from Minneapolis.
General Tharalson is not in favor
of the change, but he will take no ac­
tion until the return of Gov. Hanna,
who is touring the Yellowstone park.
Inspects Camp.
"I inspected Fort Snelling," says the
general, "and I do not believe'that it
is as desirable a place to train the re­
cruits as Camp Lincoln.
"The water is not as good, neither
is the location. Its sanitary conditions
are certainly not any better. There
were more flies.
Will Not Save Money.
"The war department makes the
plea that it will be more economical
to have all of the recruits in the north­
western states trained at Fort Snell­
ing but we do not believe that that is
true. It might take a few less offi­
cers but this would be lmaterial in
the total expense."
Nothing further has been done, re­
garding the raising of a new regiment.
For the present the recpuits will be
trained in squads and sent to the bor­
der to join the First.
STREET CAR EMPLOYES
STRIKE IN N. Y.
New York, Aug. 4.—The employes
of the New York Railway company,
at a spirited meeting tonight, voted
to strike for the right to organiza
and to enforce other demand? on the
company. The vote was unanimous.
There were approximately 2,000
men at the meeting. The strike vote
was taken after a report ha,l been
made by the committe appoin ei to
confer with officials of the company.
The reply of General aMnager Han
ley, saying he would be glad to meet
the employes of the company at any
time, was held to be unsatisfactory.
No signs of rain appearing in the
blue heavens, ten members of the
Christian Endeavor and Baraca soci­
eties of the First Baptist church,
scheduled to hike to the Missouri riv­
er to picnic, left the church at the
appointed hour, 6:30 p. m., Thursday.
The hike to the river was most de­
lightful. The young men gallantly
carried the lunch baskets.
Arriving at a cozy spot along the
rushing, roaring waters of the, pictur­
esque Missouri, the match was touch­
ed to the camp fire, the wieners roast­
ed and the marshmallows toasted.
Sing 8onge.
Then the merry picnicers gathered
around the dying embers, watched the
soft sunset, sang the old and new
songs, and drank lemonade.

When No. 1 Strikes Buggy
at Cleveland.
LLOYD BERRY'S
HIP IS BROKEN
Couple Attempted to Pass With
Fast Horse Before Lim­
ited.
C. S. Van Syke was seriously injur­
ed and Lloyd Berry had his hip brok­
en when No. 1 last night struck the
buggy in which they were riding at
Cleveland, a town at which the fast
coast train does not stop.
Both *ere brought to the St. Alex­
ius hospital on the train. Dr. C. P.
Buzzell attended them' en route and
Dr. C. W. Schoregge was called upon
their arrival.
A hasty examination showed that
Mr. Van Syke was injured' internally
and hM »?verai jibs
in a dangerous cohditioh.
Mr. Berry was not as badly hurt.
As far as the doctors could tell his
injuries were probably limited to a
broken or dislocated hip. An X-ilay
picture will be taken this morning.
Mr. Van Syke is over 50 years old.
•Mr. Berry is a young man, son of
George Berry, who formerly was sec­
tion foreman at 'Apple Creek.
He declares that Mr. Van Syke was
driving a fast horse and that when
he told him that he had better not at­
tempt to pass before the train Van
Syke laughably said that he had
plenty of time with his race horse
and drove on.
He declares that he was carried 30
feet and Mr. Van Syke, although heav­
ier, further. The horses broke away,

He is carrying a -badly bruised arm

APPEAL FOR PUBLIC
Washington, Aug. 4.—After a con­
ference between President Wilson
and Judge William L. Chamber, com­
missioner of the United States Board
of Mediation and Conciliation, it. was
indicated today that the federal gov
ernment would take no formal action
to avert the second strike of the 4G0,
000 employes of 225 railroad systems
of the country ujltil represent'ives
of the managers and workmen hail
conferred, next we$k, in, a final effort
to reach an agreement.
Any immediate action by con grass
was precluded, when the senata 001111
merce committee cabled'rnaclatio.i
by Chairman Sfewlands providing f«
an interstate commerce commission
investigation for the hours of labor on
the railroads and, including an appeal
to the,- railroad managers ar.il em
ployes to, postpone' consideration of
tion was completed, Favorable ac­
tion on the resolution had been urg­
ed by the Chamber of Commerce of
the United States and opposed by rep
resentatives of the railroad employes,
President Wilson was told by Ju'ise
Chambers that the mediation and con­
ciliation board believed there still was
a possibility of avoiding a strike
through conferences between the em­
ployers and workmen or through in
tervention by the board. It is believ­
ed the president will wait until every
other means of settlement has been
tried before intervening himself.
Should all other efforts fail, it is un­
derstood he will make a personal ap­
peal to the railroad managers and
employes.

Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 1.—With their
camp site cleared of cactus and weeds,
their tents ditched against storms,
their post exchange in operation and
a day of rest following the regimental
inspection Saturday, the First North
Dakota regiment enjoyed its first Sun­
day along ^e Mexican ^order. All
drill work wad StbaiMohfed for the day,
and after services the men
had little work to do. Concerts by
the band helped to keep up the spin
its of the men.
There twill be many hours in this
camp when the troops will not be oc­
cupied and officers say the North Da­
kota ipeople can do' a good turn for
the 'boys by providing magazines and
newspapers. Toilet articles also are
acceptable, as well as sewing kits.
Will Have Baseball League.
Most of the boys would welcome
the receipt of athletic goods, for it is
planned to organize an athletic asso­
ciation and it is possible a baseball
team will be formed in each, company.
From these teams a regimental team
will be chosen, and this -will represent
the First regiment in the league
which is being org^nize|,here and at
Llano Gr,ande.
The First experienced, a shortage
of ice the first few idays in camp, as
did all .the other regiments which
came here. There is only one small
artificial ice plant in Mercedes and
the plant was unable to meet the de­
mand of the ten regiments in camp
'hereTfthd at Llano Grande. Tee is ne­
cessary to preserve the foodstuff "arid
is desirable for the water which
taste none too good when 'boiled. Ar­
rangements were made to obtain ice
from Corpus Christi.
The 'North Dakota infantry, with
the exception of the first battalion of
the First Minnesota field artillery,
which is due at Llano Grande, three
miles west of here, soon, completes
the quota of troops for this district.
In Mercedes there are stationed the
First (North Dakota infantry, two
troops of the Third United States cav­
alry and a battalion of the Third Tex­
as infantry. At Llano Grande there
are stationed the First, Second and
Third Indiana infantry, the First, Sec­
ond and Third Minnesota infantry,
the Fourth and Fifth Nebraska infan­
try, a battalion of the First Indiana
field artillery, a battalion of the First
Minnesota field artille-y, complete
field hospital units and ambulance
companies from both Indiana and Ne­
braska, signal companies from Ne­
braska and Indiana and a company of
engineers from Indiana.
Ranch House for Hospital.
The field liosiptal for this district is
at Llano Grande. An old ranch house
has been used for this purpose, 'but it
was not large enough to accommodate
the patients, and all serious cases of
illness are now being sent to the base
hospital at Brownsville, about forty
miles from here and the general mili­
tary headquarters for this district. A
new base hospital is being established
at Llano Grande, and all soldiers from
Mercedes and Llano Grande camps
will be treated there. The new build­
ing will cost $15,000. Quartermaster
warehouses for this district also are
being built at Ylano Grande. The
army and navy division of the Y. M.
C. A. is building three Y. M. C. A.
buildiflgs at Llano Grande for the In­
diana, Minnesota and Nebraska troopa
and it is expected a similar building
will be built in Mercedes for the
North Dakota and Texas troops.

Anamoose, N. D„ Aug. 4.—A terrific
windstorm passed over this city about
7 o'clock yesterday evening. The
storm was about 20 minutes in pass­
ing over the town. lAt times the dust
was so thick that it was difficult to
see across streets, especially in
Main street where there were some
sand piles in connection with new
buildings that are being erected. No
rain and practically no lightning and
thunder accompanied or followed the
storm in town.
Reports that came in late last night
and early this morning indicate, how­
ever, that great damage was done in
some sections of the country nearby.

London, Aug. 4.—Verdun, almost
quiescent during the Anglo-French of­
fenses in the Somme region, has
again become the storm center on the
western battle front. The French
forces have taken the offensive on
the right bank of the Meuse and now
hold the Thiaumont Works and the
greater part of the village of Fleury,
according to Paris.
The Thiaumont Works, already the
scene of many desperate combats,
was twice in French hands during 12
hours on Friday. The forces of the
German crown prince fought tena­
ciously, driving the French from the
works once, but losing it again. Ger­
man counter attacks were of no avail,
says Paris, and the works remained
in the possession of the French.
Fleury Occupied by 'French.
Fleury, which changed hands
"ISlursday^ att«r 4hei EMno^J.hliA^)oc».
ceeded in taking it, is again almost
entirely occupied by the French.
Fierce fighting still continues in and
around the village. German wounded
prisoners, taken in the Verdun fight­
ing, number 400.
On the Somme front in northern
France there has been little infantry
activity, both the British and French
official communications failing to re­
port any move on the part of their
armies. London says the Germans
bombarded the section southwest of
Pozieres and also the southern por­
tion of the Mametz wood.
Desperate counter attacks by the
Germans in the region of the Stokhod
river, east of Kovel, have resulted in
the reirement of the Russian forces,
which had seized the village of Ruda
'Miryanskaia. The fact that the vil­
lage of Dillez is only 19 miles from
Kovel, the Russian objective on this
part of the E'ohemian front, probably
accounts for the intensity of the fight­
ing there.
Russians Advancing South.
The Russian general, Sakharoff's,
troons continue to advance south of
E'rody and toward Lemberg.
Petrograd reports the capture of
1,300 Austro-Germans in a hot attack

He was 75 years of age at the time
of his death, and had been in fairly
good health until taken with diabetes.
Deceased sold bis ranch at Medora
in 1905, to G. O. German, a nephew,
and moved back to his boyhood home
at Monticello, Mo. He later entered
the soldiers' home at Higginsville,
where he died.

country north and northeast of here
enormous damage was done to the
crops by hail following in the path of

a total loss. All small buildings in
the path of the storm, including a
great number of barns, were damaged
more or less, many being entirely
wrecked and shattered. It is reported
that in one case a number of horses
within a fence, becoming frightened
at the storm, ran into the barbed wire
fence and were in some cases mortal­
ly wounded. At this time it is be­
lieved that only a part of loss and
damage has been reported and that
when all reports* are in many thous­

Ratification Necessary Before the

U. S. Property.
Washington, Aug. 4.—Purchase by
the United 'States of the islands St.
Thomas, St. Troix and St. John, lying
to the east of Porto Rico and compris­
ing an archipelago known as the Dan­
ish West Jndies is provided for in a
treaty signed by the United States
and Denmark. It will be submitted at
once to the United States senate and
the Danish parliament, whose ratifi­
cation are necessary to complete the
purchase agreement.
No serious opposition is expected la
the senate. The only objection Is ex­
pected to come from senators who be­
lieve the purchase price of 925,000,000
too great.
The outcome in the Daniph parlia­
ment is more uncertain, although the
expectation here is that the treaty
will be accepted. European powers
which have wanted possession of the
island for strategic military reasons,
are not expected to look with fevof
on the purchase and they may bring
strong pressure to hear at- Copen­
