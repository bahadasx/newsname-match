announced today that as soon as the
force of men now at work on Locnct
avenue have finished they will bo put
to work tearing up tho pavement at
tho sunken place to see what can be
done to remedy the matter.
No fault in the construction of the
pavement under the trackB is the
cause of the break as an extra eight
Inches of stone was placed under the
concrete at this place because of the

the air and the Republican campaign
in this county is under way with a
splendid start that will most' surely
result in a large Republican county

All morning about the town could i
be seen small gatherings of old friends
and veterans of many campaigns, both
political and army, who had taken ad
vantage of this meeting to renew their
1 friendship and recall the strenuous
days of their youth. The younger ele
ment also was well represented and
the hustling young men who are striv
ing to earn a reputation by cheerfully
accepting the burdons and labors of
the party work were very much in
evidence and always willing to help in
any manner. , m
Shortly before two o'clock the
crowds began to drift toward the court
house and promptly at two. Chairman
Frank R. Amos, called the meeting to
order. Harry Shaw was suggested
as temporary chairman of tho meet
ing and Rollo Conley secretary. This
temporary organization was unnnl
i mously made permanent. Chairman

concerning the object of the meeting
and the work that must be done, sug
gested that the Republicans from the
