COHNERY PARTY
Of f ice Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
There are citizens who believe that
It la contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many of the
public offices In' one community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by members of
the Connery Clang to put The Eagle
out of business impelled this news
paper to ferret out just what grasp
tho Connerys have on public affairs.
The result is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can use tho United States Gov
ernment in their business.
They evidently have found the
State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to the family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
ing why all of the public Jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be due to tho fact that there
-are not enough Connerys to go around.
Connerya Flrstt
What a noble family motto that is
to be sure.
And often has the DemocraUe.fmrty
fallen for the Connerys and. their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Block! aa you
may nave heard him referred to, a
partner of John T. Connery In the coal
business, is a member of the Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Dlockl.
Partner Dlockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts in which tho Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the public Interest In them
over wholly died out.
There was a number qf talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of these
worthies before as our flies will at
test. '
But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
tt about. '
Democrats do not forget the dose
that some members of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1007 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many In
the light of the Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
if not to all, of the Jobs in Its gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given suchN great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse'B gratitude was
great.
When John W. Ralney, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of the Circuit Court
In 1012, the Connery outfit fought
him at the polls In favor ot Joseph
E. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Sweltze'r was run
ning for tho Democratic nomination
for Mayor In 1015, the Connerys saw
another chance to put a member ot the
family in that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clork and now Comptroller ot the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratlo stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
diet ot Connery and the noble Francis
D. was Bent back to the payroll to
wait for another chance.
Sweltter got the nomination and it
Is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
one ot the princes ot the blood and
were not over-enthusiastic for Bwelt
xer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asklag for much.
It Is reported that Joseph B. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law ot John T. Con
nery will not seek Republican noml-
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, the present
FOUNDED U8t
. . , ,
efficient Democratic Incumbent of that
office.
Joseph F. Connery, a brother of
John T. Connery and a brother of
Francis D. Connery and an uncle-In-law
of Joseph E. nidwlll, Jr., will seek
a ronomlnatlon for Recorder of Deeds
Michael M. Connery, brother of
John T., Joseph F., and Francis D.
Job as Inspector for Attorney Gen
eral Lucey.
Henry E. Connery, brother ot Mich
ael M. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and Francis D. Con
nery, and 'incle of William J. Connery
and uncle-ln-law of Joseph E. Bidwell,
Jr., will hold his present lucrative Job
as State Bank Examiner.
Francis D. Connory, brother of Hen
ry E. Connory, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and Michael M. Con
nery; undo of William J. Connery
and uncle-ln-law of Joseph E. Bid
well, Jr., will retain his present 6,
000 a year Job as Comptroller of the
Sanitary District ot Chicago.
Joseph M. Connery, cousin of Fran
cis D. Connery, Henry E. Connery,
Joseph F. Connery, John T. Connery
and Michael M. Connery has been
mentioned for the Democratic nomi
nation for Board ot Review this year.
State Street Dlockl, the business
partner- ot - John T. Comery, WIU not
have a chance to run again for his
present Job on the Board of Rovlew,
fcntll next year.
So William J. Connery, nephew of
John T., Joseph F Francis D., and
Michael M. Connery will retain his
nice-salared Job as Blockt's Secretary.
But by next year a few more of
fices may bo created for a few more
Connerys as It would be too bad to
have Dlockl, John T. Connery's part
ner In tho coal business running on
a ticket whero there was not another
member of the Connory family to keep
him from getting lonesome.
Connery first the rest nowhere.

CONNERY TAXES
Items About Them, Gleaned from Printed

that many Inquiries have been made
as to what personal property assess
ments are laid against these patriotic
persons by the Board ot Assessors.
The printed lists ot personal proper

lowing facts:

NOT A JOB HOLDER
And Being a German Into the
Bargain, Staats Zeitung Editor
Is Soaked for Taxes.
The 9225,000 personal property tax
assessment against Horace L. Brand,
editor of the Illinois Staats-Zottung,
was -reduced to 910,500vby the board
of review. t
Tho assessment against Mr. Brand
was on his household goods In his
homo at 533 Wellington avenue. Tho
board of assessors had valued them
at 9150,000 and had nddeda 50 por
cent penalty- for" ialllnir to file a
schedule.
No assessment at that number.
A search ot the- list ot District
No. 4, town of Lake View, embracing
the district where a man frequently
mentioned In public life, Mr. John T.
Connery, partner In the coal business
of Reviewer Blockl, resides, does not
disclose any assessment against that
gentleman which is surprising in view
of the fact that many think him a mil
lionaire. He is a brother of Joseph F. Mlchaol
M Henry T., Francis J) etc., etc.
J. T. Connerys name does not ap
pear on the printed assessment list
which Includes the territory In which
his business office at 332-South Mich
igan avenue Is located, in District 20,
town ot South Chicago.
' Labor organizations do not appear
to escape the vigilance ot the Asses
sors. The Chicago Federation oS. Labor on
its desk at 160 West Washington
street, is assessed at 9800,
Tho Brotherhood of All Railroad
Men at 326 West Madison street.
U assessed at $400.
Bakery Drivers' Union, desk In room
506, 175 West Washington street, as
sessed at 9900.
Chauffeurs' Union, desk In room
506, 175 West Washington street, as
sessed at 9900.
Laundry Drivers' Union, desk in
room 506, 175 West Washington
street, assessed at 9900.
Milk Drivers' Union, desk In room
506, 175 West Washington street, as
sessed at 9900.
Tea and Coffee Drivers' Union, desk
In room 506, 175 West Washington
street, assessed at 9600,
BUI Posters' Union, desk In room
400, 175 West Washington street, as-,
sessed at 9450.
A large number of other assess
ments against labor organisations
might be quoted.
But what's the use?
These from one district, District
9, South Town, are enough.
People looking for the Edgewster
Beach Hotel, 6325 Sheridan Road, said
to be owned la part by the Connerys
would look In vain tor it If they
searched the 1916 printed assessment
roll of District No. 4, town of Lake
WANT NO GERMAN
Democratic Connery Committee Nomin
ates Big County Ticket Without a German
Name Say Germans Have No Chance.
So-called Democrats have nominated
a ticket without a German by birth or
descent on it.
A Connery Is on tt of course, for
one of tho best Jobs.
Not a man on tho ticket had on
American grandfather, the only out
going county official who had an
American grandfather, County Sur
veyor Georgo C. Waterman, was not
renominated.
No Germans were wanted. Somo
of the leaders were Interviewed by
The Tribune with the following re
sults: Ross C. Hall, representing tho
country towns, said:
"Our ticket will be unbeatable In
November after wo have slated a
few Poles for tho Municipal court.
The city hall forces have put up a
ticket ot Swedes and Germans.
We'vo named n ticket ot Irish and
Poles. How can we lose?,"
There isn't a single German on the
entire Sullivan slate, the talk among
tho slatemakers being that no Ger
man had a chance In Cook County
this fall.
The full slate named follows:
State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne.
View for It. It Is as notablo for Its ab
sence from this list as Is John T. Con
nery's name.

and great business man, Is on tho list.

Is assessed on 92,000.

POOR VOTI GETTERS
Although the Connerys Hold
Many Public Jobs They Are
Not Strong at the Ballot
Box.
At the Democratic primary for Re
corder of Deeds in 1012 tho result
was:
Joseph F. Connery 56,343
Ills opponents 64,493
So Connery was a minority nomi
nee. At the same primary John W. Ral
ney ran for the nomination for Clerk
of the Circuit Court, tho office held by
Connery's Ropirbllcan nephew-ln-law,
Joseph E. Bidwell, Jr. Result ot the
primary:
John W. Ralney 71,695
All opponents 44,666
Ralney's majority over
all 27,029
At the same primary In 1912 John
T. Connery's partner in the coal busi
ness, Blockl, was a candidate for the
nomination for Board of Review. The
result:
Blockl, Connery's part
ner 39,415
9 His opponents 87,253
So Blockl, Connery s -partner, was In
a minority of 47,838 votes. One of bis
opponents, Charles J. Voplcka, came
near defeating Blockl, Connery's part
ner, receiving 38,989 votes to Blockl,
Connery's partner's 39,415.
In 1913, Francis D. Connory was a
candidate at tho Democratic primary
for the nomination for City Clerk.
Francis D. Connery 42,187
His Democratic opponents 51,460
So Connory was very much of a
mtnority candidate.

Any one in business will have a
sweet time in Chicago who refuses

The Clang is seeking to control
everything in politics and to blot out
all opposition to Its schemes.
This In the best reason why good
citizens should oppose- -
Gang rule.
