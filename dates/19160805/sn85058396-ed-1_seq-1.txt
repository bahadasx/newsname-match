I Renewing their powerful attack
along the Somme front in northern
I France, the British have captured the
main second line defensive system of
the Germans along a front of more
than a mile north of Po&iere, London
: announces today.
The advance claimed by the British
is on that part of the line where
their gains in the offensive movement
so far had been less pronounced than
elsewhere along this front. The gain,
; if maintained, will effect a material
straightening out of the lino in the
sector between Pozieres and Thicp-
'I At Verdun the French offensive is
successfully withstanding" German
;i counter attacks. The important work
which has changed hands several
times during the hattle, is now firmly
.' in French possession.
; In the village of Fleury, three miles
north of Verdun, the hattle still is
raging. Last night the French re
I ported they had succeeded in recap
i turing the greater part of the village
and today they announced that the
t night's fighting resulted in no ap
: preciable change in the situation
I' there.
On the eastern front the Russians
!j are continuing their drive on Kovel
I, and Lemberg.
j! Petrograd, Aug. 5, via London, 3:05
l p. m. Russian troops have crossed
j( the river Sereth, south of the town of
Brody and In the region of Penlakl
f' Tchlstopady ahd have consolidated
! the captured positions, it was officlal-
ly announced by the Russian war de
f partment.
I The official statement follows:
' "South of Brody obstinate fighting
Is proceeding on the river Sereth. The
enemy made several counter attacks
against our detachments which
crossed to the right bank in the re
gion of Peniaki-Tchistopady. All these
counter attacks failed and our troops
consolidated themselves in the cap
tured positions.
"In the region of the river Blaly
Cheremosh, southwest of Kuty (In
the Carpathians) the enemy launched
an attack with forces amounting to
T nearty a division against our small
' infantry detachments occupying the
mountain passes and forced them a
: short distance back towards the north-
east.
"Caucasian front: West of Kinlkit
'( our detachments again made an ad-
vance of several kilometers. A Turk
ish attack in the region of Kygi was
repulsed."
French Repulse All Attacks.
''' Paris, Aug. 5, 12:30 p. m. All Ger
man attacks on the French positions
last night were repulsed, says the
French official statement issued this
j' afternoon, the Kermans sustaining
! heavy losses.
Bombardment of the most vio
lent character took place over the
entire sector of Thlaumont and
.; Fleury. The battle lasted from 9
o'clock last night until eight, this
j morning, the Germans making unsuc
' cessful efforts the statement adds, to
,f drive the French from Thiaumont
work.
; The statement follows:
"The night passed in relative calm
: on the Somme front. Between the
j river Avre and Aisne we dispersed
f
several patrols of the enemy and took
a number of prisoners.
"On the right bank of the Meuse
the cannonading last night was vio
lent on tho entire sector between
Thlaumont and Fleury. The Germans
endeavored by furious counter attacks i
to drive us from the work of Thiau-1
mont which we hold firmly. This
fighting lasted from 9 o'clock last
night to this morning. It resulted in
heavy losses to the enemy, and each
one of their endeavors was repulsed
without their being able to obtain
the slightest advantage.
Still Fighting in Fleury.
"The fighting continued with equal
spirit in the village of Fluery, but it
resulted in no appreciable change In
the situation.
"There has been intermittent artil
lery fighting In other sectors.
"On the right bank of the river to
the east of Pont-a-M, after a prepara
tory artillery fire, the Germans de
livered upon our positions In the Facq
forest an attack which resulted in fail
ure under he fire of our machine
guns.
"On the Somme front French scout
ing aeroplanes delivered seventeen at
tacks upon the enemy during the
course of which two Germans ma
chines were seriously damaged and
compelled to land precipitately within
their lines. Two other German aero
planes were brought down in the re
gion of Verdun. One fell near Abau
bourt and the other, not far from Mor
anvllle." French officers point to the fact
that the efforts of the Germans are
now restricted to the Fleury-Thiau-mont
section as an evidence of the
growing weakness of the invaders'
forces in the Meuse region. The
French have succeeded in clearing the
approaches to the Souvllle and Tavan
nes forts, which at one time seemed
to he seriously threatened, and are
back within a mile of Fort Douuamont
where the most terrific fighting of the
German offensive took place.

London, Aug. 5, 5:15 a. m British
positions near Romaln, east of Port
Said, are being attacked by 14,000
Turks, according to an official state
ment jssued by the war office. The
Turks'aro attacking along a front of
seven to eight miles, the statement
says, and have so far been repulsed.
The text of tho British official an
nouncement says:
"The following report, timed 11:10
p. m. on the 4th of August, has been
received from the general officer commander-in-chief
in Egypt:
'"Since, midnight of August 3-4
Turks, whoso strength is estimated at
14,000, have been attacking our posi
tions near Romani, east of Port Said,
on a front of seven to eight miles.
" 'The position at dusk on the 4th of
August was that their attacks had
made no impression on our fortified
position, while on tho southern flank
the fighting also was going on In our
favor and between 400 .and 500 prison
ers had been captured there.
" 'Ships of the royal navy rendered
valuable service from the Bay of
Tina.
Fighting Still in Progress.
" 'Fighting was still in progress when
this report was dispatched. The tem
perature during tho day reached 100
degrees in the shade.' "
i
An official statement issued by tho
Turkish war office on Frady, stated
that Turkish airmen had attacked
with machine guns British positions
about 25 miles east of the Suez canal.
Romani is a village near the coast
of the Mediterranean and is 22 miles
to the east of the Suez canal. It
Is about 10 miles northwest of Katla,
where several engagements recently
have been fought between the British
and the Turks.
Attack on Canal Expected.
London, Aug. 5, 4:56 p. m. The
Turkish attack on the British posi
tions in Egypt to the east of the
Suez canal comes as no surpriso to
those who are in close touch with tho
operations in that part of the world.
General Sir Archibald Murray, who
commands the British army there,
has long realized that the Turks, with
the assistance" of 'the AustrlanB and
Germans, might make a serious at
tempt on tho canal even at the hot
test period of the year.
Austrian and German engineers for
many months havo been digging for
water which, closo to tho Mediterran
ean coast, exists in many cases at no
considerable depth under -the sand,
although it mostly is too brackish for
use of European troops. The Turks
must, therefore, have made very
thorough arrangements for the stor
age aud transport of water, the coun
try being a pure sand desert with
small widely scattered oases of date
palm growing around ancient wells.
At Romani, where fighting is in
progress, the Tiyks must, bring, up ev
ery drop of water from Aughratina,
some ten miles away.
.It is understood that the Turks
have with them some 1000 Austro
German infantry as well as a large
number of Bedouin irregular horse.
Their choice of the coast routo in
stead of the caravan road from Katla
to Kantara, which they took the last
time, brings their flank under the fire
of warships in the Bay of Tina.

Blames Republicans for Treas-

Policy.
ENCOURAGED OUTLAWS H
President . Held Up Before
World as Unworthy Respect
of Foreigners or Support
of Countrymen.
Washington, Aug. 5. Senator Lew-
Is, the Democratic whip, spoke in the
senate today in reply to the attack up
on the administration made by JM
Charles E. Hughes in his speech of
accepting the Republican presidential
nomination.
Republican strictures upon the ad
ministration's Mexican policy, Senator
Lewis denounce'd as "treasonable."
He announced that the clause of the
Republican platform repudiating inter
ference in the internal affairs of
Mexico was responsible for the mas
sacre of troops at Carrizal.
"Not until the captains of the Re
publican party shot at the president
of the United States did the Mexican -,
outlaws shoot at the soldiers of the
American president," he said. The
platform declaration, Senator Lewis
characterized "as a summons to Car
ranza and Villa to revenge the en- 'M
trance of American soldiers into Mexl- .
co and the Interference of America, in. . m i
her internal affairs. f1 v
"It was the Republican convention," 'M
said Mr. "Lewis, "which slew the sol
diers at Carrizal and he assailed ef
forts of the Republican leaders to
make Mexico the issue "without regard
to facts, equity or justice."
"Revolt against the government at
Washington as to Mexico for that is
the issue," he declared. "Denounce
the president as to Mexico far that
is the issue. Make contemptible your
own country before the world when
ever you can for that is the issue.
Humiliate your own fellow man by
holding hfs country and his president
up before the world as unworthy the
support of his countrymen or the re
spect of foreigners."
