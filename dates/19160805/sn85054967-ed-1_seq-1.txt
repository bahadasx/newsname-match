Allied Patrol Now Trying
To Locate the Deutchland
Meanwhile, German Submarine Is Believ
ed by Marine Men to Be Safe at Sea.
NO WORD ABOUT THE BREMEN
NORFOLK, VA., Aug. 3 —The Allied cruisers which
have been patrolling the entrance to Hampton Roads to
prevent departure of the German submarine merchantman,
Deutchland still were in position within sight of shore dur
ing the day, and there was nothing to indicate that they
were aware of the passage of the Deutchland throngh the
capes last night. Marine men here believed the submarine
has entirely eluded the war vessels and was safely speeding
across the ocean.
The Bremen, another submersible oiway to the United
States was not heard from recently. It is thought she will
dock at an eaily date.

COST OF WHITE PAPER
FORCES N. Y. PUBLISHERS
TO CUT DOWN THE*SIZE
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.—Pub
lishers of daily newspapers in
greater New York, at a meeting
yesterday afternoon, took action
which will result in a decrease
of the number of pages in their
morning, evening and Sunday
The reduction of so many
issues of 121 pages a week,
pages is a step to relieve the
news print paper situation,
which is regarded by the pub
lishers as very serious.

is NORFOLK, Va., Aug. 3.—The
dare-devil dash of the Deutsch
land has begun. Somewhere out
on the broad Atlantic or beneath
the heavy swell of the ocean
the German submarine, with its
captain and crew, hoping to
elude the British navy, might
iest in the world, is homeward
bound.
Qff the Virginia capes a sol
itary grim British cruiser
steamed slowly back and forth
today watching the "rat hole,"
which has already delivered its
deep sea rodent to the mercies
of the ocean waters. The cruiser
is the sole unit remaining of the
allied British and French squad
rons that took up the wait for
; the Deutschland shortly after
the German submarine thrilled
the world by crossing the broad
Atlantic and reaching an Amer
ican port..
Cruisers In Pursuit
The other allied warships,
variously said to numbed from
four to seven, are combing the
ocean in pursuit of the Deutsch- 1
i land.
"But she will not be caught,"
was the declaration made today
by Captain Hinsch, port captain
of the company which owns the
submarine.
"German genius designed the
Deutschland and she is manned
by German daring. She will get
through."
Captain Hinsch also declared
his belief that the Bremen, sis
ter ship of the Deutschland,
would arrived safely.

It is said that McFarland's
domestic relations are somewhat
complicated, that he has more
than one wife. Mrs. Rodgers,
who lives near Punxsutawney,
and Chief of Police Clayton Pal

here Monday morning and in the
presence of 'Assistant Coroner

tate and saying that he needed
the money to complete the fun
eral arrangements.
McFarland represented him
self as a Government detective
in Strandford Saturday. He
gained admission to a number
of houses on the grounds that
he was searching for stolen
goods. The woman of one house
missed some jewelry after he
had gone and she notified Rail
road Detective Byrnes, who se
cured an automobile and went
in pursuit of the man catching
up with him in a ravine near
Strangford, where the fatal re
volver duel took place.
Detective Byrnes has been ex
onorated.

children climbed into the wagon
and whipped the mules into a

started toward Jacksonville, two

auto. Rhea stopped him and
plained the situation and Mr.
Fritchman started after the run
aways. He caught up with them
more than a mile away, passed
the team as it was about to

One child had been thrown

Burned by Lightning
Mr. and Mrs. William Luhr
ing, of Rayne township
Rendered Unconscious.
Mr. and Mrs. \yilliam Luh
ring, of Rayne Township, were
rendered unconscious and bur
ned from head to feet by a bolt
of lightning Monday evening.
Several were in the
house during the storm and they
were all seated in the kitchen
w r hen the current passed thru
the opposite end of the house
through the adjoining room,
where the current evidently
scattered as it passed to the cel
lar below as well as through the
door and over the bodies of Mr.
and Mrs. Luhring, who were
thrown from their chairs and
rendered unconscious for some
time. The path of the current
can be plainly traced by a discol
ored line which extended from
their head to their feet. The
hair on the back of the head of
Mrs. Luhring was slightly bur
ned by the current and the hair
on a portion of the body of Mr,
Luhring is plainly singed. The
condition of both husband and
wife was regarded as most ser
ious for several hours after their
terrible experience, and it requi
red the services of Dr. H. B.
Neal, of Indiana, to revive the
couple.
Mrs. William Luhring, the
mother of the injured man, was
seated between the couple who
had such a narrow escape, but
she experienced only a slight
shock as did all the others in
the house. The house was fired
by th bolt, but the damage was
only slight.
