Politics Absorb Much
Local Interest Now
Next Tuesday is primary election
day and from then on and until the
date of the county convention, Sep
tember 19th, many candidates will

will open next Tuesday at 8 o'clock
and remain open until 6 in the even

ination for county commisssioner
long term. lie had planned to enter
the, race as an independent candi
date; but has concluded to take his
chances in the convention.
Probably the most important j
event in political circles during the
past week was the entrance of James
A. Nesblt actively into the race for
the Democratic nomination for sher
iff. While there had been tn ink-j
ling "that Jim's hat would be in the
ring, it was not definitely known
that the aforesaid lid had really
been tossed into the arena until last
Saturday. This was followed up by
the entrance of a rival set of dele
gates from Pioche precinct to the
Democratic pow wow. The election,
as far as the Democrats are concerned,-
is likely to be a warm one.
Some of those who filed their names
early are known to be antl-Nesbit,
anti-Carman and other antls, so this
led to the filing of a new set of can
didates for delegate.
The formal announcement of
Itiauico . & . . . i. i 1 1 v. . i in. "ii" -sheriff
appears in this issue. Every
body knows Jim. Should he win
The only other contest for county
delegates is at Caliente and it will
be in the Republican primary. Down
in the railroad town there will be a
three cornered fight between E. N
Mitchell, A. II. Norris and George
K. Riding.
Only one set of candidates to the
state convention were put in the
field by the Democrats of this coun
ty, an I they are all pro-Pittman
for United States senator. Pat Mc-
Carran, to the surprise of a good
many, did not extend his campaign
to Lincoln county.. .But he has, been
busy in the bigger counties that is,
where the big vote is, and probably
reached the conclusion that his time
could be better spent in the counties
where the big vote is and just let
Pittman have Lincoln county. The
Democratic candidates for delegate
to the state convention are Henry
H. Lee. Geo. M. Senter and W. T.
Stewart, Sr.
the nomination he will poll a strong
vote throughout the county.
There are five candidates for the
Republican party's two delegates to
the state convention. As stated in
last week's Record, M. L. Lee and
Henry Mathews are accredited ad
herents of Judxe Norcross for the
nomination for United States Sena
tor; while E. Kahn and Pat Devlin
are of the opinion that Sam Piatt
should be United States senator from'
Nevada. Dr. J. West Smith of Cal
iente also filed his name as a dele
gate to the state convention last Sat
urday. Just who he favors for sen
ator the Record has not been in
formed. Anyway, this makes a five
cornered fight.

The announcement of Dan J. Ron
now for the office of assessor of Lin
coln county appears in this issue.
It is a recognized fact that Dan has
made a good assessor and it is un
likely that he will have any opposi
tion in the Democratic convention.
All of the thirteen precincts in
the county will be represented in the
Democratic county convention. At
least there are candidates for dele
gates from each precinct. With the
three delegates-at-large the Demo
cratic convention will consist of 23
delegates. Some declare this is an
unlucky number and that it will
be skidoo for a bunch of Democrats
in November. However, the Repub
licans will have no edge on their
opponents on that score. Five pre
cincts in the county failed to file
names for delegate and therefore
Will have no voice in-the coming
county convention. These precincts
are: Clover Valley, Elgiu, Alamo,
Hiko, and Deer Lodge. Had they
done so, with the two delegates to
y.he state convention, the county
ReDublican convention would have
consisted of eighteen five off that
number makes thirteen; the number
that will be in the county conven
tion. So the Democrats insist that
thirteen is just ast unlucky as twenty-three.
William Hammond has decided to
come before the county convention
of the Democratic party for the nom-
each year for 10 years for the de
velopment of rural roads in the Na
tional Forests.

The act requires that the appor
tionment for each year shall be made
in the same manner. Different sums
are appropriated for each year and
the apportionment must also take
into consideration the population as
shown by the latest available Fed
eral census and the mileage or rural
delivery and star routes as shown
by the certificate of the Postmaster
General for the next preceding year.
A new apportionment, therefore,
must be announced for each fiscal
year.

W. Spencer Black, a Los Angeles
mining engineer, arrived in the city
early in the week for the purpose of
making an examination of the prop
erty of the Atlas Mining company
located in . the Jack Rabbit mining
district in the interest of eastern
parties who have an option upon a
large block of Atlas stock. He was
accompanied by T. W. Taylor, one
of the large shareholders of the At
las company.
Coincident Fred Markwell and
another party arrived from Califor
nia in a Ford car, making the trip
in three days from Los Angeles
averaging a little more than 200
miles per day. Mr. Markwell is here
for the purpose of looking over the
district with a view of making in
vestments for himself and others.
Building Refrigerating Plant
Joe Powers is erecting a refriger
ating plant on his lots just above the
Record office which will have capaci
ty for a car of beer and a car of ice.
The plant will cost, it is said, about
$2,000.
Everyone in Pioche is agreed that
last Tuesday was somewhat ot a
"hoodoo" day. At any rate it was a
day of accidents and near-accidents
which might have brought much
sorrow to this peaceful community.
During the mnrt hour, William
Culverwell, driving the Culverwell
Brothers' auto bus and having as
passengers a son of Mrs. Jennie Wil
cox and Lew Gillisple, backed the
machine off the embankment near
the court house, when it rolled
down the hill, making three com
plete revolutions before coming to a
halt. As far as the auto was con
cerned, no damage was done except
to the top which was completely de
molished. The Wilcox boy was sit
ting in the seat with the driver;
they both Jumped when it was seen
that the machine was beyond con
trol, and got out with only a serious
fright. Mr. Gillispie did not fare
so well. . He was on the inside of
the bus with no possible chance of
escape and was obliged to stay with
the machine as it tumbled down the
embankment. However, he consid
ers himself very fortunate that he
got out with nothing worse than a
broken collarbone and a few bad
bruises.
Later in the day, Harry L. Parker,
superintendent of the Pioche-Bristol
mine, was coming to town having as
a, companion it,. LCliriateTisenpwho
had been employed at the property,
Coming down to a point near the
stone cabin the car hit a rock which
flew out from the wheels hitting Mr.
Parker, who was at the wheel, back
of tho ear. The rock came with
such force that Mr. Parker was mo
mentarily stunned and let go his
grip on the steering wheel. This
resulted in the car turning turtle
with Mr. Parker amd Mr. Christen
sen landing underneath. Parker,
gaining his senses, crawled "out
from under" and assisted Christen
sen in gaining terra firma. At first
it was believed that the latter was
seriously hurt and Parker made
haste to Jack Rabbit and telephoned
for a physician. When brought to
town it was found that Christensen
had suffered no broken bones and
other than being sligjitly bruised
was all right.
But what might have been the
worst disaster, of ail was a runaway
team belonging to the Atlanta-Home
Mining" company. J. W. Pratt, l,e
teamster, was loadng a lot of gro
ceries onto the wagon In front of t.'-e
Hodges-Cook Mercantile componv.
wiien an iron hoop, manned oy a
small boy, frightened the horses and
they took ndown Ma1'; street. Turn
ing north on Liicour ftreet the 'ci;-
on, team and all i.iied into a hiip
in front of the Commercial club.
Meanwhile, a box of matches took
fire, which was communicated to a
can of gasoline. The fact that in the
wreck was 500 pounds of giant pow
der caused a fright which will not be
soon forgotten. Men, women ana
children ran frantically to places of
safety, fearing that an explosion
might follow any moment which
would blow the central part of town
to atoms. But in the crowd were
cooler heads, men who are accustom
ed to handling of powder in the
mines and no doubt their presence
is all that saved an awful catastro
phe: They went about picking up
the sticks of giant strewn here and
there until all were accounted for.
While this was going on, a line of
fire hose was stretched and water
turned on to extinguish the fire
which would soon have caused an
explosion of gasoline.
During the day a miner working
in the Prince Consolidated mine had
his foot mashed. In the evening, a
furious thunder storm prevailed in
the vicinity of the Delmue ranch and
a bolt of lightning killed a valuable
cow. So all in all, it was a day of
one disaster following another but
fortunately it was no worse. Surely
it was bad enough.
Reports from the Con
Utah mill this week Indicate thai
everything is running along smooth -
ly with a better record of extraction. I
than at any time since the plant wat
placed in commission. Aside from
a few hours shutdown on Sunday; ;
and Monday, the mill has been going; ;
continuously this week. The man-iiU
agement has been carrying out some ,
suggestions given by Allan H. Rog
ers, the company's consulting engin
eer, duting his recent visit, with a
noted improvement. t - ,
The mill is tyrning out from
three to four car loads of concen
trate per week, four cars having
been dispatched last week and three
this week.
The mine force has been increased
somewhat on account of the mill
drawing a heavier tonnage from the
mine and using less from the dumps.
In the stope above the 1400 level a
few days ago a streak of high grade
galena ore was encountered which
assayed 186 ounces in silver, with 3 .
per cent copper; aside from very
good values in lead and gold. This
ore is being kept by itself to be
shipped to the smelters later.
The south cross-cut on the 1400
level has been extended through the
Yuba dike and is now in th quartzite
beyond the dike. The drill holes
yesterday showed the presence of a
greater volume of water, which Supt.
VanWagenen declares is a good
sign, for this is almost a sure indi
cation of the close approach to the
ore bodies towards which the cross
cut is being directed.
The tailings pond is working out.

GROOME EXTENSION
COMPANY ORGANIZED
The Groome Extension Mining Co.,
owners of several claims lying next
to the Big Groome property this
county, held their organization meet
ing last evening and elected W. C.
Browne, President, H. L. Parker,
Vice President, and B. L. Smith, Sec
retary and Treasurer. '
In order that active development,
already lined up, may be pushed as
rapidly as possible the directors de
cided to offer a small 'block of treas
ury shares to the public at 10c per
share. See ad in another column.
FOURTH OK JULY FUNDS
RUN SHY TO MEET BILLS
The Fourth of July committees, at
least in some instances, overstepped
their bounds notwithstanding that
about $500 was raised to car
ry on the expense of the cel
ebration. It appears that the re
freshment committee, which had
charge of the arrangements for the
barbecue exceeded the limit placed
on the appropriation for that pur
pose, as did the Bports committee.
with the result that the funds ran
short by about twenty per cent ot
enough to meet the remaining bills.
The members of the executive com
mittee met last Wednesday evening
and after checking things up discov
ered that there was only enough
money in the bank to pay 80 cents
on the dollar. Accordingly checks
were sent out upon that basis to
meet outstanding claims.
PRINCE CON. POSTS
ANOTHER BIG DIVIDEND
Officials of the Prince Consolidated
this morning announced another
quarterly dividend of 5 cents a share.
This requires the payment of $50,
000. The distribution will be made
on Sept. 1 to stock of record Aug.
24.
This payment will bring the Prince
Con dividends up to a total of $300,
000. It amounts to 30 cents a share
on the 1,000,000 shares issued. This
Pioche mine is shipping to the Utah
smelters at the rate of about 3,500
tons a week from its low grade iron
ore bodies. However, the new 200
ton mill at Bullionville is now treat
ing ore from the 125,000 ton dumps,
and this, too, is expected to soon be
gin to add materially to the profits,
of the company. Deseret News.
