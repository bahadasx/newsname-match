The niiteome in the Danish lmrl:

tlie expectation here Is that the treaty
will he accept -d, Fuiopcin powers
which have wanted possesion of the
Islands fi r stritcgic military reasons
are riot expected to look with favor
en the I reposed sale to the I'nited
States and they may bring strong
pressnie to hear at Copenhagen. Fail
ure of 11 similar purcha.se treaty In
the Danish parliament years ago was
nttrihutod to Cierinan influence.
The signing of the treaty took
place in New York, where Secretary
Iunslng and Constantin Mrnn. tho
Danish minister, both away from tho
capital on vacations, met to affix their
signatures to the document.
A copy, which will he filed at tho
Mate department, was brought to
Washington tonight hy Assistant So
licitor Woolsey.
Details of the part will not he made
public until it is transmitted to the
senate at least. It is understood to
provide, however, for complete acqui
sition f the Islands, but to stiplntc
that Danish business Interests there
shall bo guaranteed protection. A
clause also is included ceding to Den
mark the undefined American rights
of discovery In Greenland, a Danish
possession.
Great IHwwitillity.
Senator Idge emphasized In his
statement tonight the possibility that
the Islands, If not acquired hy tho
I'nited States, might fall Into the
hands of some European power and
Involve this government in difficulties
under the Monroe doctrine, "which
might easily lead to war" a consid
eration which it Is understood has
been prominently before the eyes of
officials here In their negotiations
for the purchase.
"In tho Interest of peace," said Sen
ator Lodge, 'It Is of great importance
that these Islands should pass into tho
bands of the I'nited States. From
a military point of view their value
can hardly be overestimated. The fino
harbor of St. Thomas fulfills all tho
required naval and military condi
tions. As has been pointed out by
the late Admiral Mahan it is one of
the ureal strategic points in the West
Indies.
"The population is only 33,000, of
whom nearly thirty thousand aro
negroes. There Is no possibility of
any material Increase In population
and annexation would never Involve
at any time tho troublesome question
of statehood.
"The Danish Islands, which could
bo readily defended from attack, oc
cupy a commanding strategic position
and are of incalculable value to the
United States."

IV tit I'arisien, Theodoie Hoonevelt
said that tho allies, particularly Eng
land, would be wrong to place more
cor.fidrnce in President Wilson than
In Hughes. He continued:
"If Mr. Hughes had not been the
car-didate my choice would have been
Senator Lodge or General Wood, who
are both strong characters and not

affairs of America, hut are nccus-
tomed to consider, with a large view,
the military situation und internation

"Hut if my sympathy for Hughes is
not so spontaneous as that for Lodge
or Wood, I recognize his high quail
tier, wllch must re:ommend him to
the esteem of the whole world, and
particularly to the sympathy of tho
allies. Hughes, before all, la upright
and Mralghtforwari.
"He has a very high sentiment of
Justice and dignity, and, moreover,
always translates his words into
deeds. 1'erhaps, In certain questions.
i notably that of the blockade, he
would have differed from President
Wilson, but he would certainly never
have suffered the government of the
I'nited States, one of the signatories
to the Hague treaty, to pass without
protest, the violation of Uelgian neu
trality by Germany.
"He would never write two notes
on the same offense. He would, per
haps, issue a warning, hut afterward
he would act according to hi con
science and for the honor of civiliza
tion. "This is what he certainly will do
In the future If. as I sincerely hope,
he becomes president of the I'nited

MEXICAN NOTE IS

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4. Indica
tions tonight were that Presi
dent Wilson would appoint three com
missioners within the next few days
to meet a similar delegation already
selected by General Carranza to un
dertake .settlement of the internation
al differences arising from disturbed
conditions along the Mexican bolder.
In a note delivered to the state de
partment today General Carranza
named his commissioners, but did not
answer specifically the suggestion of
tho Washington government for en
largement of the powers of the coin
miKMiin. It is believed, however, that
the reply is generally satislactorv to
the administration and that negotia
tions will proceed without delay. Act
ing Secretary 1'olk would not discuss
the communication today, saying he
had not had time to study It.
Tlirci- Niiits Outlined.
General Carranza says In his note
that the Mexican coiumissionei 8
"preferably" will discuss the three
points outlined in the Mexican com
munication of July 11, which aro
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico, the framing of a protocol to
cover future border operations, and
an investigation of what interests
have promiited border raids. State
department officials arc understood to
regard this at least as leaving the
way open for broader iMiusiileratiotiH,
such as they desire should the com
mission bo successful in finding a so
lution for immediate problems.
It Is possible that in notifying the
Mexican government of the appoint
ment of the American commissioners
and the time and place of the con
ference, Mr. 1'olk will take occasion
to indicate again that the I'nltvd
States expects tho conferees to be
free from tho close limitations Im
plied In the new Mexican note, but
will avoid any detailed expression on
that point. The commission then
would be left to map out its own
course unless General Carranza had
somo specific proposition to offer.
There was nothing to indicate to

Kvers declared yesterday that there

Mioulil all other efforts fail, it is

Commissioners Will Allow
Time to (Jet Acquainted

meeting yesterday morning voted
unanimously for ordinances which
will limit the passenger load of a Jit
'ney to the seating capacity and to
Increase the license cost to $150.
After a reign of terror for pedes
trians, extending hack for more than
four months, the city commissioners
yesterday took action which is ex
pected to drive completely from the
business the fly-by-night Jitney men
who persist in endangering lives of
passengers and pedestrians; in giving
little or no heed to the laws as now
enforced; to carrying as many as 1j
passengers of a f Ivc-passenger car,
and in changing from one route to
another, or from the J'tney to livery
service with no attention to the class
of operating license tney have se
cured?. Try to IW-nt liws.
Since the advent of tho Jimey into
the commercial business of Tulsa
there has been a class of ibe.se oper
ators who persisted in flying In front
of the law, appealing their eases when
once convicted in court and doing ev
erything to "beat", the lw which
had been promulgated to regulate
their busni"ss for th'ir own interest
and the interest of others.
Many operators use 'icir cars in
Jitney serv ice vvIi-ti ' things are good,"
or during the rush hours ol the day
and then change over from their
scheduled routes and use tlieir cars
in livery service, even making trips
into the country and to adjacent
town..
This Is a violation of the spirit
under which the jitney license w :m
issued; is unfair to the operators of
the purely livery cars and decreased
the c ffielern y of tlie routes in the
city, throwing double the number of
passe n (."' I s of normal times onto the
few cars w in. h remained on the

bill occupied the senate today. Si n

that congress ha ample authority to
exclude products of child lalsir from
Interstate and foreign commerce and
Senator Hardwick, Democrat, Insist
ing that federal legislation of such
a character clearly was an infringe
ment on the rights of the states.
Senator Horah asserted the measure
merely carried out the recognized
police power of congresM over Inter
state commerce. It must be conceded,
he said, that there are some things
so bad that they must be denied the
channels of interstate commerce, and
thai a line must be drawn somewhere.
When It came to discrimination in
such a matti r, he argued, it could
not be left to the states and must
necessarily fall upon congress
Senator Hardwick charged both
parties with "playing to political x
pedloncy" with child labor legisla
tion and said he felt ashamed because
his party had favored it in the St.
Louis platform. The bill, he do.
el.ired. was directly against a purely
domestic and internal affair whose
regulation lay in the sole pow i r of
the states. He said he was earnestly
