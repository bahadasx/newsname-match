HUBS
B.OCKET
Leaders Decide it is Too Late,
to Reassemble National
Convention.
WILL PERPETUATE PARTY
Electoral Ticket Will be Placed
in Every State Where Or
ganization Remains.
Indianapolis, Aug. 4. Plans for
the reorganization of the progressive
party as a national political organiza
tion were adopted here last night at a
conference of bull moose representa
tives. The conference after a heated
discussion, decided it would be im
practicable at this late date to reas
semble the progressive national con
vention and fill the vacancy on the
national ticket caused by Theodore
Roosevelt's declination of the nomi
nation for president. Instead the
organization will put up an electoral
ticket in every state where there is
the neucleus of an organization left,
bearing the name of John M.Parker of
Louisville, nominee for vice presi
dent, in.the hope of perhaps electing
enough presidential electors who
might prove the balance of power in
event of a close contest between the
two old parties.
Among the states in which the plan
will be carried out are Louisiana,
Marylandj Indiana, Missouri, Wisj
consin, Michigan and Minnesota.
J. A. H. Hopkins of New Jersey
was chpsenjreasurcr of the rehabili
tated bull moose party, and Matthew
Hale of Massachusetts, vice chairman
or the national committee, will be m
active chargaof the campaign. An
executive committee of fifteen mem
bers will be named by Vice Chair
man Hale to co-operate with the fif
teen members of the national com
mittee who refused to vote for the en
dorsement of Chas, E. Hughes, at
Chicago, June 26, in rehabilitating
the party. This committee will meet
after the November election to formu
late plans for the perpetuation of the
party. These plans may include
some kind of amalgamation with the
prohibition, socialists and woman's
parties. Edwin M. Lee, state chair
man, Bainbridge Colby and others
were named members of the execu
tive committee.
GOOD ROADS
ADVOCATES
To Visit Big Rock, Teftn.,
to Make Speeches
Aug. 12.
A big good roads rally, boosting
the Stewart county, Tenn., bond is
sue, will bo held at Big Rock next
Saturday, Aug. 12. R. E. Cooper,
Col. W. R. Howell, Judge Walter
Knight and other eloquent and a
thusiastic good roads orators from
Hopkinsville have been asked to
mount the platform in the interest of
the issue. A largo representation
from the Hopkinsville Business Men's
Association, with Secretary John W.
Richards managing the trip, will go
in automobiles, to the rally.
Voting the bond issue in Stewart
county is or more than ordinary in
terest to the Hopkinsville business
men. It also vitally concerns Clarks
ville, who will have possibly a larger
delegation than Hopkinsville.
Following the Christian county
bond issue appropriation, a state road
will bo built from Hopkinsville to La
feyette. Should the Stewart county
officials be persuaded to build from
Dover to Weaver's store, instead of
from Tobaccoport to the Montgomery
county line, it would put Hopkinsvillo
on a direct lino with Dover, Fort Don
elson and the Cumberland river and
make Hopkinsville the principal busi
ness place of the Tennessee county.
JUDGE BREATH
ITT'S OPINION
Holds That Pro Tem Mayor
Will Now Succeed To
Mayor's Office.
MAYOR F. H. BASSETT.
City Attorney James Breathitt has
given his opinion in regard to how
the vacancy caused by the resignation
of Mayor Frank K. Yost shall be
filled. Judge Breathitt's con
struction of the statutes is that a com
missioner should be elected at the
November election and that Mayor
pro tempore Frank Bassett will con
tinue in that office during the remain
der of his term. Whether the new
commissioner will receive $1,800 or
$600 has not been stated.
WILL K. I. T.
BREAKDOWN?
One Team Withdraws; Two
Others Ready To
Quit.
Like Aiax defying the lightning,
President Bassett denies that the
Kitty is Jrumbling. Poor 'old Kitty
She's had a hard time this year. Now
she's gasping in a dying breath. Dr.
Bassett may be able to perform an
operation that will save her life,
He's the only man in the world who
could. But then he is mayor of Hop
kinsville and resembles Atlas as well
as Ajax.
Dr. Bassett said last night that no
official statement of the withdrawal
had come to the president's office
from any team except Madisonville.
He said he had been too busy to look
into the reports from Henderson,
Clarksville, Owensboro and Dawson
that hot weather and b'ld baseball are
hard on the fan crop,
Hopkinsvillo is still hobbling but
she is wagging a weary foot. The
game Thursday illustrates the feeling
of fans and players. When the cost
pocket edition of a crowd that does
attend -a game knocks its own team
until the only two or three good play
ers on it threaten to put on their
sneaks and leave the field in the
middle of. a double header there's
something wrong.
It's the truth that hurts but to spurt
it out, ihe amateur pln which the
Kitty has been brawled with is a
failure. ,
Are the fans uniutcrastsd because
of the poor article of ball that is being
played or is the ioor urtlule oi mil a
result Of the lack of iuturust on the
part of. the fans? The problem has
knots.
The situation in the league so fat-
as can be ascertained and studied out
seems to be this:
Madisonvillo has positively wiih
drawn.
Dawson wishes to be withdrawn
witli Madisonville.
Hendorson and Owensboro have
agreed to skip out of the league and
play a sovon game scrios tis independ
ents, v
Clarksville has sent up an S. O. S
call.
Hopkinsville is not paying.
Dr. Bassett, who is the only man
in the universe that could keep the
leaguo going, is too busy to work it
back into shape.
The players are all grumbling be
cause of held-up salaries and .are
gore at the lack of spirit of the fans.
COMMISSION
1$
Messrs. Cabrera, Bonillas and
Pani Will Represent De
Facto Government.
MEETING EXPECTED SOON
President Wilson Awaits
Carranza's Final Word
of Acceptance.
Washington, Aug. 4. The final
word from Gen. Carranza to initiate
organization of a joint commission for
the settlement of border disputes is
expected to reach Washington in a
day or two and officials believe the
commission's deliberations may begin
within a week or ten days.
Official announcement in Mexico
City that Mexican commissioners al
ready had been selected was taken as
a sign that the American suggestion
for broadening the scope of subjects
to be considered at the conferences
probably had been accepted. Neither
the Mexican embassy nor the state de
partment, however, had been offici
ally advised, regarding selection of
the commissioners of Gen. Carranza s
decision as to the matters they will
discuss.
While no formal comment was
made at the department in advance of
official notification, there was nothing
to indicate that the three commission
ers named, Messrs. Cabrera, Bonillas
and Pani, would not be entirely ac
ceptable to department officials.

The Kitty league has been an insti
tution in Western Kentucky. It has
been a vital factor in its life but it is
tired and needs a rest.
Tho days of the Kilty are number

soon bo with us no longer. Requies
cat in pace.
Unfortunately the people who are
satisfied with themselves are seldom
satisfied with anything else
NAMED
SHORT STOP
BY OFFICIAS

Flash In The
Pan.
The representatives of the Illinois
Central railroad who it liad boon an
nounced would pay an hour's visit to
discuss matters of importance and
meet the prominent citizons of Hop

time Thursday and left half an hour
earlier than was expected. They
walked right in and turned around
and walked right out again.

business men had made arrangements
to go the train and give the visiting
officials a warm reception. A num
ber of business men had matters of
business they had intended to talk
over with the railroad men but no
opportunity was offered to do any
thing but shake hands. It had been
announced that the train would arrive
at 11:20 but those who arrived at the
depot at this time saw only the obser
vation coach winding around the bend
Through the energetic work of
Passenger Agent T. L. Morrow, how
ever, enough of the business men of
the city were on hand to shake hands
with the officials of the I. C, and the
stop here was not entirely fruitless.
The railroad men, headed by W, D.
Longstreet, head of freight and trafib
department of the" South, made the
acquaintance of a nunber of Hopkins
ville men.
