GHJ. EVAtJS ASKS FOR 24 BIPLAtlES,
EXPERTS Fflfl AERO CLUB OF HflUAII
Hawaiian Department Commander Writes War Department
For Authority to Instruct National Guard unicers uanu
; , to Be Aviation Center of Pacific--!n "Preparednessv Plans
-i V QtvL Robert K. Evans, commanding the Hawaiian department, and offi
cers of tho department Interested in aviation, hope to launch the Aero Club
tt lttrill with a! loast a. thmmanil members.
. Gen. Evans, who Is personally very deeply interested Jn the formation ,
of this club, has written the ar department asking (or 24 biplanes and
Uo civUian Instructors, expert ariators. He is also asking for authority ,
to instruct all naUonal guard officers ho wish to become pilots, and. as
many cirlllana as the caDacitr of the uchool will permit. -
The scheme a now outlined is to
iave the embryo aviators take their
f rat lessons .In water-flying, this be
ing the Bafer. and. when ; they become
. proficient in hydroaeroplanes, to have
them take land-machines and pick up
the more difficult division of the art
py practise at Schofleld. '
There are two factors In the de
velopment of aviation in Hawaii now
absorbing the attention of the : army
i.uthorltiea, ihe militia and a large
Xiumber of , the civilian population who
are interested in the preparedness
' Campaign which is being conducted to
:'r rlfice our country in a position to
avert war.
The first is the proposed location
on Oahu of an aviation school simi
le to the one at North Island, San
Diego', California. General Evans has
asked the war department to ; send
the men and machines here for the
g'tabllshment and .has sent a letter
t? the various posts of the island, ask
ing that the names of all officers who
would be willing to take a course in
aviation here be ' submitted ; to him.
The enthvslrjtlQ replies from the dlt
: ferent posts prove that there is abun
dant material here :for . the establish-
nicnt; of a .sonadron of the aviatlon
ccrps that shall be second to none in
the country.' . ' ' ; : . ' .
A Similar Letter ti National Guard.
- This will notbe the first time thai
.the advantages of I Ia'all as a flying
elation have been; realized by.; army
men.; Many will remember-the han-

horsepower that are being turned out
b the Curtiss, the Martin and Wright
factories , today. These machines
would have little trouble in navigat
ing the air lanes of these Islands. .
- The second step In placing Hawaii
cn the t map,, aeronautlcalry, is the
lounding of the Aero Club of Hawaii,
an organization which la to be affiliat
ed with, and work in conjunction with
the ' Aero Club of America. -
This is a plan that is being and has
been fostered by General VL K. Evans,
cccunanding general of - the Depart
ment of Hawaii, who has been a most
enthusiastic aaember of the-Aero Club
of America for many . years and who

Leases', When; Informed His

HoMinrj of Meeting :
l Charles E. King has been refused
recognition as a member. of the board
of trustees of the Bishop Estate. ';
As forecast in' the tar-Bulletin,
King yesterday attended a meeting of
the trustees.' The remaining trustees
declined . to give him a seat in the
meeting as one of their number.
There was no argument or discussion
over the trustees- refusal. King left
the meeting after hearing the trustees'
decision. ':-".-""'"':: -' '' '
U -According to E. C. Peters, attorney
for King, the trustees told King that
they would not recognize him as one
of their number. They said that the
only person recognized as trustee to
succeed Samuel M. Damon, resigned,
was William Williamson, the attorney
4deL Williamson was nominated by
the Justices of - the1 supreme court
tp . succeed Samuel Damon. : Cir
cuit Judge C. W. Ashford held that
the justices of the 6upreme court had
no power, to fill the vacancy, declined
to confirm, the appointment of Willi
amson and appointed King. . .. v
King's attorney, says that the trus
tees further declared that Williamson
would take no part in their meetings
nntil the. matter, which Is again be
fore the supreme court, this time on
-appeal from Judge Ashford's -tfecision,
is determined.' ; '
- They said that they could not have
a meeting with King present, so King
withdrew," Attorney Peters concluded.
It Is expected that argument on the
trustees' appeal will be " had in the
tuprtne court within a short tlae.
