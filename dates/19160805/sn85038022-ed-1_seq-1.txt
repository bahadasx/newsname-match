"The Square Deal Man"
of the faucets and had water from the
reservoir after it had been treated at
the puaip house. As shewn in the let
ter, the first was heavily charged and
the latter entirely free from pollution
This report is from one of the best
chemists in the state, who devotes a
great deal of time to these examina
tions. Hla word can be taken In the
matter aa absolute roof that the water
from the reservoir is free from pollu
tion. A great many people have always
feared the river water In any form ex
cept after being boiled for some time.
This assurance will drive away all
doubt us to whether the water is san
itary or not. Since the great epidemic
of infantile paralysis In New York City
and other places sanitation has be
come a great topic before the people,
more so than ever before.
McGRASER TI'RNED ADRIFT
"Muck" McGraner, formerly of the
Maysvllle team of the Ohio State
League (requeiscat in pace), haa been
released by the Louisville club to
whom he was sent, he not showing
enough class for the Colonels. He is
a southpaw and when he pitched his
first game and won he was written up
"big" by the Louisville papers. But
when he lost his second game he was
a punk pitcher and had to go. He will
undoubtedly catch on with some minor
team. Well, Its better to have been up
for Just one day than never at all.

necessary to complete tha purchase
agreement.
No serious opposition Is expected In
the Senate, where action will bo
sought nt the present session. 8ince
negotiations began several months
ago, the Foreign filiation Commit

velopments and Its members are un
derstood to be virtually unanimous In
their approval.

Senator Lodge, tint ranking Repub
lican member, isaued a statement to
night declaring the argument in favor
of acquisition of the Islands are un
answerable. The only objection la ex
pected to come from the Senators who
believe the purchase price of 2R,000.
000 too great
The outcome In the Danish Parlia
ment Is more uncertain, although the
expectation here la that the treaty
will lie accepted. European powers
which have wanted iwiaseslon of the
islands for strategic military reasons
are not expected to look with favor
on the proposed sale to the Cnited
States and they may bring strong
pressure to bear at Copenhagen.
It is recalled that failure of a simi
lar purchase treaty In the Danish
Parliament aeveral years ago was at
tributed to Oerman Influence
Treat Signed in New York
The signing of the treaty took place
in New York where Secretary Lansing
and Constuntln Ilrun, the Danish
Minister, both away from the capital
on vacations, mat to affix their slgna
turea to the docotnt. The copy
which will be filed at the State De
partment was brought to Wasmngtonj
tonight by Assistant Solicitor Wool-
se.V.
Details of the pact will not be made'
public until it Is transmitted to the
Senate, at least. It understood to
provide. however. for complete
scqnlsltlon of the Islands but to stipu
late that Danlah business Intcreats
there shall he guaranteed protection.
A clause also Is included coding to

Girls' Gingham and Percale
Dresses Under Price
"I always find the prettiest and most girlish styles in your store," said a mother the other day, and t bests are just such
dresses. That they are offered at reductions merely means we are desirous of a clearance. Excellent ginghams and per
eales in plaids, checks and plain colors, neatly trimmed and well made. Sizes 6 to 16.
We could not possibly buy these dresses at wholesale for the price at which we offer them. But the insistent cry for
"something mw'' compels us to elose out the stock now so we can have an entirely new assortment for (he coming season.
Mothers lose a splendid bargain opportunity who fail to see these attractive little frocks.
