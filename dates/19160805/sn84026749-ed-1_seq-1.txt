FOR HUGHES
Announces Allegiance to Re
publican Party Says Pro
gressives Are "Dead."
DENOUNCES THE DEMOCRATS
Says .Members of His Clan Must
Consider Who Offers Mass
Drift of Opinion.
NEW YORK, Aug. 5. Raymond
Robins, who was chairman of the
Chicago Progressive Convention,
today announced his allegiance to
Hughes and the Republican party
in a 2,500-word statement, de
nouncing the Democratic party
and asserting that the Progressive
party is "dead."
He said the 1914 elections had
showed Progressives regarded the
Progressive candidates of 1912
merely as the representatives of
a protest, and that Roosevelt cor
rectly interpreted this in refusing
to run in 1916.
It became necessary, therefore,
for Progressives to consider which
of the old parties offered the best
of the "mass drift" of opinion
for voters of Progressive tenden
cies. CONTROL IN. FIFTEEN STATES
"The primary voter man control of
th DemocmtUT-party "-MEltf fifteen
Southern and Southwestern State and
Id the industrial cities ofthe nation,"
he asserted. "The fixed Southern con-
trol of the Democratic party Is indi
vidualistic In its thinking, sectional In
1U sympathies, and Inherits a tradition
against common labor as servile.
"The Democratic primary mass voto
control In the industrial cities la most
hetexrogcneous of our national groups.
and the oxcesslve pressure of living
and industrial conditions renders It the
most fertile Held for boss control In the
service of selfish personal and corporate
Interests.
"The primary voter mass control of
the Republican party is In the rural
communities of the Central. Western,
and Now England States. This group
represents tho highest literacy in
America."
Robins cited Republican achievements
end how Republican-Progressives In
New Hampshire. California, Wisconsin,
and Pennsylvania "broke boss control."
Ho denounced tho present Illinois
Democracy as being "more completely
under control of a corporation boss who
represents tho worst in our political
system, than at any time in twenty
years."
Robins detailed a comprehensive gen
eral progressive plan of legislation
which he approved. He closed with
Slowing eulogy of Hughes.
At Cross Roads.
Robins' statement continued:
"Wo progressives stand nt cross
roads. 'American socialism, industrial
and political lite has broken down under
tho old individualistic control. A new
national mind and conscience develop
In social unity, industrial standardiza
tion, efficient political honesty from a

goal of our American Ufa.

the courage of tho nominee or

ONE WORD DELAYS
ACTION ON MEXICO
Translators Fail to Agree on
Shade of Meaning in Car
ranza Note.
The Administration's peaco of mind
concerning the Mexican situation hangs
on the exact meaning of the Spanish
word "prefcroncla,"
According to the Mexican embassy's
English version of Carranxa's latest
communication, tho word Is to be read
"preferably," the sense being that the
Mexicans appointed as members of the
proposed Joint commission should con
cern themselves "preferably" with a
discussion of withdrawal of tho Ameri
can troops and arrangements for the
future patrol of tho border.
Thus far the State Deportment's
translation has not been made public,
but It Is known that 'the department's
translators are In extreme doubt as to
whether the word should be trans
lated "preferably" or "preferentially."
Should tho latter word be used It would
bo regarded an a much moro binding
restriction upon the scope of tho com
mission's deliberations.
Until tho matter Is cleared up, it la
understood the President will not ap
point any American members of the
commission.
He is understood to hava tn mind
the selection Secretary of the Interior
Lune( Associate Justice Brandels, of the
Supreme Court, and Dr. Henry Allen
Tttppor, of the pence forum.
OSBORNE MENTIONED

Warden of Sing Sing May Run on

NEW YOKK, Aug. 6.-Thomas M. Os

seriously discussed as a possibility for
the Democratic nomination for governor
at a conference here, In which Charles
F. Murphy and his up-Stato allies took
part.
Mr, Osborne's nams canto up before
tho conference after Senator ttobert
Wagner, whoso nomination had been
agreed on, made a pathetic plea that
he be eliminated as a candidate.
The same group of Democratic leaders
took part In yesterday's confab, and
the up-atate men especially were re
luctant to heed Senator Wagner's plea.
Nevertheless, when he told the conferees
that, loyal organlastlon man that he
was. he did not roitsh tne job ot being

D. C. EXCISE BOARD
Senator Jones Withdraws Op
position to -Confirmation of
Maryland Nominee.
Andrew J. Cummlngs. kn&wn as "Cy,"
will be confirmed by tho Senate as mem
ber of the .excise board of the District
to succeed Gen. Robert O. Smith,.
This was practically settled today
when Senator Jones of Washington,
who has been holding up the confirma
tion, announced in the open Senate that
he would not oppose Cummlngs further.
Senator Jones a short time ago said
certain charges had been brought to
his attention. If sustained, they would
demonstrate that Cummlngs was an un
fit appointee.
Today Senator Jones said that the
persons who had made certain allega
tions to him had not backed them up
with adequato evidence He mado it
plain he would not further oppose con
firmation. He said Mr. Cummlngs had
assured him he would strictly enforce
tho law as a member of the excise
board.
Jones Abandons Opposition.
Senator Jones said:
"Mr. President, a few days ago I
dUcussed the exciso conditions of tho
District of Columbia. I stated that
some charges had been made against
Mr. Cummlngs who had been lately
appointed by the President as a mem
ber of tho excise board and that if
those charges were true they were
sufficient to warrant his rejection
by the Senate. Such Investigation as
has been possible has been made and
In view of the statement I made the
other day I think it but fair that I
should state in the open Senate that
those making such charges have not
furnished ample evidence of the
truth of the charges; at least not
sufficient has been found to warrant
further opposition to his confirmation,
as I do not think the Senate would re
ject him upon the evidence available.
"Mr. Cummlngs Is not the sort of man
who I think ought to have been nomi
nated for this position, but under tho
circumstances I feel that further op
position would not be Justified.
"Furthermore. Mr. Cummins has made
every assurance that a man could mftko
that In the administration of this law
he will administer the spirit and lett-tr
of It in tho Interest of morality, tem
perance and good citizenship in tho Dis
trict of Columbia.
"For these reasons I shall myself not
interpose further objection to his con
firmation. I hope he will mako good,
If he docs there will be no opposition
to his appointment. If he doesn't mako
good, It will be his own fault, and If hla
course does not meet with the approval
of the moral forces of this District, lie
nlone will be to blame."
The fact that Senator Jones has aban
doned opposition Is looked on by the
friends of Mr. Cummlngs as meaning
he will be confirmed. Sonator Jones'
announcement canto today rather unex-
pecteaiy, in view ot me toiegram tne
Snator gavo out yesterday from W. II.
Anderson, former superintendent of the
Maryland Anti-Saloon League. Mr. An
derson charged that while in the Mary
land legisimure cummlngs lined up with
the prohibitionists most of the time In
order to defeat them In a crisis.

WORKERS TAKE NO PART
Six Boroughs Tied Up and Two
and a Half Million Persons
Affected By Dispute.
NEW YORK, Augf. 5. Incipient
rioting and hundreds of acts of
petty violence marked the opening
today of the latest development in
the biggest street car strike in the
history of America's greatest city.
After the first few riotous gath
erings of strikers were disbursed
by the police, however, New York
waited to see how tight the tie-up
would be. ,
Walk-outs by men of the New
York Railways Company and the
New York and Queens county
lines, which began shortly before
midnight, brought the total num
ber of companies affected up to
six in Yonkers, Westchester, Flush
ing, White Plains, the Bronx, and
Manhattan.
Two and a half million passen
gers ride on these lines daily.
Nearly 7,000 motormen and con
ductors out of a total of nearly
15,000 have struck.
TROUBLE IN EAST SIDE.
Greatest trouble In operating the few
cars running was experienced in the
heart of the crowded East Side, whero
many of tho strikers live. On EtBex,
Delancy, Clinton, and Grand streets
and sections of the IJowery, enormous
crowds of women, boys, men, and oven
little girls poured out of close-built,
many storied tenements and swarmed
to tho streets and tracks.
These crowds carried chairs, stools,
buckets, and all kinds of portable fur
niture. At times, it was necessary for
cars to stop thirty minutes before police
reserves could push nnd shove a pas
sageway through the mob, which re
mained orderly nnd quiet In most in
stances. Occasionally, however, a car loaded
with passengers would slow down liter
ally against the crowds, and suddenly
a bucket of garbage or over-ripe fruit
would be thrown from a window Into
the car.
it was impossible to distinguish bona
fide passengers from strike sympnthis-
vro, nu ouen limes, in clearing
cars siriKe-orcaKing motormen and con
ductors were shoved to tho street and
temporarily swallowed up In tho Jam.
Strikers Not Present.
As far as pollco could determine no
strikers were present. To nil appear
ances tho crowds are composed wholly
of "sympathy folk."
Somewhat similar scenes wero enact
ed at Fifty-third and Broadway, In
the heart of tho automobile and the
atrical districts.
Big crowds gathered thrre on foot.
Impeding many a well-known stago star
hurrying to rehearsal. At one tlmo
several hundred trucks ond teams wora
blocked In an Inextricable conglomera
tion which stopped servtco for long
periods.
The sltuaUon grew moro omlnlous to
day, when It became known that J00
guards and ticket-sellers employed on
subways and elevated roads mot tn
secret session to formulate demands to
be presented to the companies Monday.
Spread of the strike to Staten Island
was expected hourly. When men on
lines there go out, and It seemed In
evitable today that they would, tho
strike will have been carried to every
surface line In Greater New York.
The usual charges and counter
charges ot hiring of thugs of respon
sibility for Inciting of vlolenco were
flung back and forth between com
pany end union officials today.
President Shontz of the New York
city or "green car lines," issued a
statement charging one of the strike
leaders with being a known dyna
miter. Shontz declared the man was con
nected with the bomb outrage during
the recent San Francisco prepared
ness parade. Union leaders denied
the charge.
Police Are Ready.
Police arrangements have been com
pleted, with flying strike squads as the
Important unit of the force. .Police
Commissioner woods said today he an
ticipated no necessity for calling on
Governor Whitman for troops.
