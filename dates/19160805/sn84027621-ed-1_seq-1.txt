ed 3,000 acres of muck and hammock
land on the Oklawaha river near
Stark's Ferry, and has begun the de
velopment there of a sugar cane plan
tation, a large truck farm, a sugar
mill, and canning factory. The lands
have been leased by the company, for
00 years.
The new development will be known
as "Lombay." Work of clearing the
lanas nas aireaay Degun, ana ou
houses for employees are under con
struction. Preparations are being
made to put in 1,000 acres in vege

plant 1,000 acres in sugar cane in the
spring. What vegetables cannot be
sold in the market for good prices will
be canned. No vegetables will be

Philadelphia, Aug. 5 A quarantine

Mr. C. C. Cash, the" young man who
has been on duty as an extra police
man, and whom the Star criticised
rather sharply yesterday, called at
the Star office this morning and asked
for a vindication. He produced a
large bundle of testimonials as to his
honesty and discretion, one of them
signed by our honored postmaster,
Col. R. F. Rogers. Mr. Cash, in his
stay in Ocala, seems to have been af
flicted with a case of too much zeal
ousness. No doubt that he was hon
est and vigilant, but he had not learn
ed the tact that is one of the leading
characteristics of a good policeman.
He will probably, do better next time,
and we hope he will.

Frank Jackson, colored, a paralytic,
at the colored hospital, is in a bad
fix. He was sent here some months
ago by the Lake county authorities,
according to the nurse in charge, with
instructions to care for him and said
authorities would pay a' certain sum
monthly for his care. The nurse now
says that no more money is forth
coming and she does not know what
to do with Jackson,' as he is unable to
care for himself and she is unable to
keep him'. Jackson has been receiv
ing medical attention from a local
nhysician, who says that nothing but
time can avail him in getting back his
strength. Meantime the case should
be looked after by someone, and any
toward his suonort wlil reach

LIGHT OPPOSES A BOND ISSUE
Reddick, Fla., Aug,
2, 1916.'
To the Editor, Ocala Star:
Here are my reasons why I will
both, work and vote against the pro
posed $900,000 bond issue :i
1. It will cost the tax, payer too
much for the benefits received.
2. We can get as good or better re
sults for one-half the cost.
3. It will take a large amount of
cash out ; of the county which could
and should remain in the county.
4. The taxable .wealth of the coun
ty is liable to decrease instead of in
creasing in the future unless new
wealth producing means are introduc
ed, therefore, taxes may be greatly
ncreased. ; " ' j -
5. The increase of population in
the county does not correspond with
the increase of taxes.
6. The big question: How can we
produce more cash to pay our taxes,
ive better, prove to the home-seek
ers coming to Florida that our, in
comes are large, our taxes light, and
that it will pay them to come and live
with us? ,
Here are my reasons:
1. The total cost (if all accounts
are met when due) for the $900,000
bond issue will be $1,782,850 for
roads, (see Mr. Cam's, and other fig
ures), to improve 146 miles of our
hard roads and build 58 miles of new
roads. It . will cost on an average,
$7935 peri mileand not one cent for
the upkeep of the ney roads.
I am quoting from the civil engi
neer's report: "The cost of building
new road (lime) between Ocala and
Mcintosh was 12 Vz cents per lineal
foot, or $640 per mile. . The cost of
the Lowell and Flemington road was
11.4 cents per foot, or $583.28 . per
mile (lime and - clay). Ocala and
Leesburg road, 8.6 cents -per lineal
oot, or $439.20 per mile. The Ocala
and Dunnellon road, 13.3 cents per lin
eal foot, or $696.30 "per mile. The
Ocala and Sharp's Ferry road, $868
per mile." -
The proposed bond issue proposes
to consume $7935 per mile on an av
erage, on principal and interest alone.
Or ", we can build twelve miles of lime
road like the road from Howell's,
north, (Mcintosh and Ocala road), for
the same cost to build one mile of the
proposed new road. We can build
nearly fourteen miles of road, on Low
ell and Flemington road, to one mile
of the proposed new road; or eigh
teen miles of the Ocala and Leesburg
road; or eleven miles of the Dunnel-
on road; or twenty-one miles of the
Ocala and Sharp's Ferry road.
2. It will take out of the county
cash that should remain here. The
average interest n bill will be about
$30,000 per year, or $900,000; the prin
cipal about $30,000 per year, or $900,-
000, totaling $1,800,000. This means
taking $5000 per month of cash from
our tax payers for the next thirty
years never to return. We can spend
annually $100 per mile on about 100
miles of our roads, $200 per mile an
nually on about 100 miles, or $30,000
per year, which will answer our pur
poses and keep this money in circula
tion in our own county, at one-half
the cost of the" proposed new roads
I honestly believe that It will be
better to spend $30,000 per year on our
present hard roads than to send $60,
000 per year out of the county, as the
proposed bond Issue will do.
3. The taxable assets are liable to
decrease Instead of increase,
The best asset we had ten years
ago, was on lumber and turpentine in
terests. Our vegetable interests and
the turpentine and lumber wealth of
the county is about gone. The vege
table business In this county is hard
ly one-tenth of what it was ten years
ago, and unelss we develop profit-pro
ducing interests corresponding te the
lumber and turpentine interests and
the vegetable business, which we are
losing and our taxes will be no less
some of us will be compelled to pay
more taxes, especially so if we add
an interest bill of an average of $30,
000 per year and a principal bill o:
$30,000 per year.
4. As to population and taxes: The
1915 census report says the increase
of population in this state during the
last ten years was 49.9 per cent., ana
the increase in Marion county but

partment of the supreme lodge of the

present attending the supreme lodge
in session in Portland, Oregon.
OCALA PRECINCT
FAVORS A BOND ISS UE
The Ocala precinct - meeting held
last night in one of the rooms of the
Commercial Club, for the purpose of
selecting delegates to the convention
here Monday to discuss bonds, had a
small attendance, probably due to the
rain. The meeting seemed to be in
favor of bonds. There was no ex
pression of .opposition to the proposed
bond issue. Twelve delegates to the
convention were named, and were not
instructed. These delegates wiirmeet
this afternoon at the Commercial
Club at 3 o'clock.
T. T. .Munroe was chosen chairman
of the meeting and Louis H. Chazal
secretary. It was agreed that a
committee of three, consisting of W.
D. Cam, LV W. Duval and J. J. Gerig,
be appointed by the chair to name the
twelve delegates. The twelve select
ed, and approved by the meeting, are:
T. T. - Munroe, W. D. Carn, D. S.
Welch, Louis H. Chazal, D. E. Mclver,
ohn L. Fdwards, W. T. Gary, E.M.
Osborne, R. R. Carroll, F. E. Harris,
A. C. Cobb and J. D. Rooney.
In a short talk in favor of good
roads and bonds, Mr. Rooney said
hat upon visits to the sections he had
bund the -people of Fairfield favor
able to bonds for permanent roads,
and he found the voters around Elec-
tra were rather against bonds, but
would probably vote for them on a
sound business basis.

getting worse, what, will be the pros
pects of increasing the number of tax
payers In the county V
Now, as to taxes: Mr. Carney's re
port to the state comptroller in 1903
says that Marion county taxes includ
ing public schools ,and sub-schools
and state and county taxes, was $92,-
821 . Mr. Colbert's books show that
our taxes for the same purposes in
1915 were $231,851.33; or, we paid
$149,871 more taxes in 1915 than ten
years before, or 162 per cent, increase
n, taxes to 6.7 per cent increase in
population or, our : taxes increased
more than twenty times as fast as
our population.
Is tt wise, under these conditions,
to vote $1,800,000 additional taxes?
5. Our road . expense - In 1909 was
$22,805.20; In 1910, it was $26,450j in
twelve months in 1913 and 1914, it
was $49,367.30; in six months in 1915
and 1916 it was $14,637.05.
Now, the proposition is to spend an
nually $30,000 on an average for in
terest, $30,000 for principal and about
$20,000 for general roads. Total, $80,-
000 a year, and at the same time make
th burden no heavier for the tax
payer than it has been! .
HOW CAN IT BE DONE?
The most important question to me
is, how can we make our businesses
more profitable? How can we bring
more cash into the county? How .can
we live better?
It Is not $7958 per mile in hard
roads that we need most, we need a
packing plant in Ocala, a peanut oil
mill in Ocala, someone to buy our suj
plus hay, corn, hogs, cattle, and the
products of our farms.
Solve this question first, then build
new roads next.
Yours truly,
L. S. LIGHT.

Recount Showed Errors in Several
Precincts and Gave Knott 12
Net Gain
(Special to the Star)
Orlando, Aug. 5. Pursuant to writ
of mandamus the inspectors and
clerks in, four of the 20 precincts of
Orangeeounty assembled at the court
house here yesterday and recount
the vote cast June Gth for governor.
In precincts 8 and 16 the second choice
votes were incorrectly tallied. As a
result of the correct tallying of the
vote in these two precincts, Mr. Knott
gained ten second choice votes and
Mr. Catts gained four, giving Mr.
Knott a net gain "of six second choice
votes. -
In precincts 1 and 2, which embrace
the town of Orlando, the vote appear
ed on the face of the original tally
books to be" correctly tallied but a re
count demonstrated the fact that
neither precinct was correct. In pre
cinct 1, there was some change in
every candidate's vote. Both Mr.
Knott and Mr. Catts gained on second
choice votes. The net gains for Mr.
ivnutw jii wns precinct were nve votes.
In precinct 2 there was a gain of one
second choice vote each for Mr. Knott
; ii.:. ' i. r-
and Mr. Catts. Mr. Knott gained his
votes from Hudson and Mr. Catts
gained his from afirst choice vote for
Knott, giving net gain in this pre
cinct of one vote for Mr. Knott.
There was some criticism before
hand concerning the recount of pre
cincts one and two as the inspectors
and clerks were considered above the
average, but those who watched the
recount and could seev the possibili
ties for error, were convinced beyond
dcubt that these men made errors
that should be " corrected in a close
contest. .
The ballot-boxes wrere found in in
tact and sealed just as sent in by the
inspectors.
The impression is. gaining ground
here that if errors exist in such pre
cincts as 1 and 2 of this county, it is
clear proof that few of the large pre
cincts in the state are correctly
counted.
ROUNDED UP THE ROBBER
Deputy Sheriff Osteen, who has
been working on the burglary case
growing out of the robbery Sunday
night of the Hayes & Guynn store,
last night arrested Leon Davis, a col
ored boy, at Shady Grove, and he is
now in the county jail awaiting a
hearing.
Davis - lived in the southwestern
part of the city, but immediately after
Monday morning's close call, he went
to live with relatives at Shady Grove,
and it was there that the officer found
him and also a trunk and suitcase
containing a quantity of stolen goods.
Leon's baggage was brought to the
sheriff's office, where nearly all the
articles therein were identified by
Iayes-& Guynn, Frank Gadson and
E. T. Helvenston as their property.
These stores have been burglarized
within the past few months, and
.eon, not having immediate use for
the goods, did not even go to the
rouble of removing the labels, which
made identification easy. Among the
goods were clothing, jewelry and
toilet articles. ' The latter have not
yet been identified.
One of the shots fired at Davis
Monday morning grazed his hip, but
made only a slight wound. He will
te arraigned the early part of next
week.
