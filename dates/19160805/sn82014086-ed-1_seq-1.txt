French Forces, Taking the Offensive, Have Captured
And Are Holding the Thiaumont Work
COUNTER-ATTACK OF THE
The Village of Fleury is Again Almost Entirely Occupied by
the French, But Fierce Fighting Still Continues in and
About That Village Petrograd Reports That the Rus
sian Troops Continue to Advance South of Brody and
Toward Lemberg British Naval Aeroplanes Have At
tacked a German Military Establishment in the Vicinity
of Ghent, Belgium, London Claiming That Considerable
Damage Was Done.
Verdun almost quiescent during the
Anglo-French offensive in the Somme
region--has again become the storm
center of the western battle front. The
French forces have taken the offensive
on the right bank of the Meuse and
now hold the Thiaumont work and the
greater part of the village of Fleury,
uceording to Paris.
The Thiaumont work, already the
fcene of many desperate combats, was
twice in French hands during twelve
hours on Friday. The forces of the
German crown prince fought tena
ciously, driving the French from the
work once, but losing it again. Ger
man counter-atiacks were of no avail,
tays Paris, and the work remained in
the possession cf the French.
Fleury, which changed hands Thurs
day after the French had succeeded in
taking it, is again almost entirely oc
cupied by the French. Fierce fighting
still continues in and around the vil
lage. German unbounded prisoners

FOR PURCHASE OF THE
DANISH WEST INDIES.
Treaty Signed Yesterday by the
United States and Denmark.
Washington, Aug. 4. Purchase by
the United .States of the Islands St.
Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, lying
to the east of Porto Rico, and com
prising an archipelago known as the
Danish West Indies, is provided for in
a treaty signed today by the United
States and Denmark. It will be sub
mitted at once to the United States
eer.ate and the Danish parliament,
whoso ratifications e.re necessary to
complete the purchase agreement.
No serious opposition is expected in
the senate, where action will be sought
at the present session. 'Since the ne
gotiations began several months ago
the foreign relations committee has
been in ciose touch with developments
and its members are understood to be
virtually unanimous in their approval.
Senator Lodge, the ranking republican
member, issued a statement tonight
declaring the arguments in favor of
this purchase. The outcome of the
Danish parliament is more uncertain,
although the expectation here is that
the treaty will be accepted. European
powero which have wanted possession
of the islands for strategic military
reasons are not expected to look with
favor on the proposed sale to the
United States, and they may bring
strong pressure to bear at Copen
hagen. It is recalled that failure of a
similar purchase treaty in the Danish
parliament years ago was attributed to
German influence.
The signing of the treaty took place
in New York. Details of the pact will
not be made public until it is trans
mitted to the senate, at least. It is
understood to provide, however, for
complete acquisition of the islands, but
to stipulate that Danish husiness in
terests there shall be guaranteed pro
tection. A clause also is included
ceding to Denmark the undefined
American rights of discovery in
Greenland, a Danish possession.

GERMANS OF NO AVAIL
official communications failing to re
port any moves on the part of their
armies. London says the Germans
bombarded the section southwest of
Pozieres and also the southern por
tion of the Mametz wood. Desperate
counter-attacks by the Germans in the
legion of the Stokhod river, cast of
Kovel, have resulted in the retirement
of the Russian forces which had seized
the village of Rudka-Miryansskaia.
The fact that the village is only nine
teen miies from Kovel, the Russian
objective in this part of the Volhynian
front, probabdy accounts for the in
tensity of the fighting there.
The Russian General Sakharoff's
troops continue to advance south of
Brody and toward Lemberg. Petro
grad reports the capture of 1,300 Aus-tro-Germans
in a "hot attack" on the
line of the Serreth and Graberki rivers.
A squadron of British naval aero
planes has attacked with bombs a
Gr-i-man military establishment in the
vicinity of Ghent, Belgium. London
says considerable damage was done
by the dropping of two tons of bombs.
Unofficial reports received in Am
sterdam apparently confirm these
claims.
NO FEDERAL ACTION
IN RAILROAD CONTROVERSY.
Situation is Expected to Come to a
Crisis Early Next Week.
Washington, Aug. 4. After a con
ference between President Wilson and
Judge William L. Chambers, commis
sioner of the United States board of
mediatiofe, it was indicated today that
the federal government would take no
formal action to avert the threatened
strike of 400,000 employes on 225 rail
road systems of the country until rep
resentatives of the managers and the
workmen had conferred next week in
a final effort to reach an agreement.
Any immediate action by congress
was precluded when the senate com
merce committee tabled a resolution
by Chairman Xewlands providing for
an interstate commerce commission
investigation of the hours of labor on
railroads and including an appeal to
the railroad managers and employes to
postpone consideration of their differ
ences until investigation was com
pleted. Favorable action in resolution
had been urged by the chamber of
commerce of the United States and
opposed by representatives of the rail
road employes.
President Wiison was told by Judge
Chambers that the mediation and con
ciliation board believed there still was
a possibility of avoiding a strike
through conferences between the em
ployers and workmen or through in
tervention by the hoard. It is be
lieved the president will wait until
every other means of settlement has
been tried before intervening himself
The situation is expected by officials
to come to a crisis early next week.

proved the income tax rate of two
per cent, a year on all incomes in ex
cess of $3,000 for single persons and

be considerably increased.

Wiat Advertisers
Of a recent date this is what we found in a letter addressed to the
editor: "Please do not think that because we are paying for adver
tising in your columns we expect you to use any reading matter that
you would not use if you were not carrying our advertising."
We were pleased because this was evidence this great advertis
ing corporation did not harbor any irrational expectations. They real
ized that there could be no good service to them If it were not an
honest, voluntary and free service unbiased by fear or favor.
We are sorry today little advertisers sometimes think they are
buying control of the editor instead of buying space, and threaten
not to do business if they cannot dictate the policy of the pa'Per cr
the opinions to be expressed by the editor.
What would an advertisement controlled newspaper be worth?
The readers would not respect its opinions or lend it their support,
and no advertiser would feel like wasting money on such a worthless
namby-pandy sheet.
Good advertising is only to be had in a paper that is free and
honorable in its dealings with its patrons and the public.
The Bulletin's Thinker was in no danger of doing anything from
fear or favor. This is not in keeping with its policy. It sells space as
our merchants sell goods and means to give full value for the money.
Prices reasonable! Results satisfactory.
The Bulletin is an associated press paper, is in touch with all the
world's news centers, and is always increasing the news without in
creasing the price.
Following is a summary of the news printed during the pat

tmerson, who is an architect, en
lited Nov. 2, 1913, in Troop CB, First'
squadron, cavalry, of the state militia.
When the militia call was sent cut
by President Wilson on June 18, and
the guardsmen were asked to take the
federal oath of service for six years,
Emerson refused, saying he could not
do so without seriously injuring his
business.
Declined to Give His Name.
He was at first allowed to return
home by the state authorities, but
later was notified by the war depart
ment that his refusal to take the oath
did not discharge him from his obliga
tion to obey the orders of the presi
dent. On going to the Framingham
camp Thursday to inquire regarding
hi; status, Emerson was asked to give
his name and company. He declined
and was placed in the guard tent. His
counsel at once asked for a writ of
habeas corpus and Emerson was
brought before the court, under guard,
today.
Refusal Regarded as Insolence.
Colonel Sweetser of the state forces
told the court that Emerson's conduct
in refusing to answer qiuestione was
regarded as insolence to a superior
officer and that inasmuch as he had
not been discharged, and his term of
enlistment had not expired, he was
subject to military authority under the
Dick bill.
Claims He is Not Amenable.
Emerson's counsel, on the other
hand, contended that the new national
defense act passed June ?. abolished the
state militia. He pointed out that the
act specifically set fort hthat no militia
would be recognized except such as
was organized in accordance with the
terms of the act. The act provided a
ne woath, he said, which the defendant
declined to take, making him, there
fore, counsel argued, no longer subject
to militia authority.
Judge Dodge remarked that the case
presented certain difficulties, but that
on the evidence as presented he would
order a writ to issue in behalf of Em
erson. Because of certain technical
faults in the papers, however, he would
continue the case until tomorrow
morning, he said.

from IS to 60 years. No one, however,
seemed able to give a good descrip

1,500 employes of the New York Rail
ways company, which operates more
cars than any other company in the
borough of Manhattan, voted unani
mously tonight to strike immediately
for recognition of their right to or
ganize and to enforce other demands.
Another division of the company's
motormen and conductors who are on
duty tonight will meet at two a. m. to
take a strike vote and union organ
izers predicted they were certain .to
follow the course taken by their fel
low employes.
Employes' Reply Unsatisfactory.
The strike vote was taken tonight
after the reply of the company to an
ultimatum from its employes had
been declared unsatisfactory. The re.
port of the negotiations was made by
a committee of six which had been
appointed to confer with General Man
ager Frank Hedley. The CQmmittee
demanded the right to organize with
out intimidatio nnd a wage increase
from thirty cents to thirty-three cents
an hour.
A letter received by the committee
from Mr. Hedley said he was "at all
times willing to meet the employes
of this company," and that he would
be glad to see the committeemen at
his office at noon tomorrow.
The meeting was marked by tumul
tuous enthusiasm and the vote to
strike was greeted with cheers which
could be heard for blocks around the
assembly hall
"Strike! Strike!" was the shout
which came from all corners cf the
hall when the report had been read.
Then followed the formal motion to
cease work which was carried without
a dissenting voice.
C. L. F. Delegation Present.
The meeting was attended by a del
egation from the Central Labor Fed
eration representing 350,000 union men
who pledged their moral and financial
support to the motormen and conduc
tors in their efforts to unionize. Tel
egrams were received from Chicago,
Roston and Detroit making similar
pledges.
A firm of Boston lawyers wired that
friends of the care men,s union in
that city "will advance to you for the
benefit of the Amalgamated Associa
tion, on your own terms, $100,000 to
help you and the New York car men
in their fight to win industrial free
dom and independence.
Scouts Sent Out.
Hundreds of scouts and "mission
aries" were sent out at the close of
the meeting to inform other en.
nloves of the company that a strike
had been ordered and to convert those
who might be reluctant to join the
wa Ikout.
Prompt action was taken by Gen
eral Manager Hedley to provide for
emergencies. As soon as he had been
informed of the action of the men
he notified Max Schmittberger, chief
inspector of police, that a strike had
been called on the lines of the New
York Raiways company. Schmittber
ger at once detailed men to guard the
power houses and car barns of the
company. Uniformed policemen will
be assigned to every car operated eith
er by faithful employes of the cor
poration or by strikebreakers.
1, 500,000 Travel on Lines.
If the strike order goes into effect
without a hitch, all Manhattan will be
dependent for transportation tomor
row upon the subway and elevated
lines, already crowded to suffocation
in the rush hours. The number of
persons who travel to and from their
work upon the surface car lines has
been estimated at 1,500,000. Even a
fraction of this army forced to ride
upon the overhead or underground
trains will seriously disrupt operating
schedules, it is feared.
Complete Tieup is Threatened.
The threat has been made by union
organizers that they would tie up
every transportation line in the city,
although no serious effort has been
made as yet to organize the employes
of the Interborough Rapid Transit
company, which operates the subways
and elevated roads and which con
trols the Now York Rilways company.
So long as these avenues of transpor
tation remain open there will be no
serious interruption to the commer
cial life of the city.
It was confidently predicted by
union organizers tonight, however,
that the Interborough's workers would
soon be found in the ranks of the
strikers.
Brooklyn Not Affected.
Transit facilities in Brooklyn have
not been affected thus far but it was
reported that many employes of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit company
were becoming restless and it was
feared that the strike might soon
spread across the river.
The strike, which now threatens to
become the most serious of its kind
In the bistory of the city, began in
Yonkers, extended from there to the
Bronx and then to the lines of the
Third Avenue Railroad company. A!)
these transit lines are operated by the
same parent corporation.
Corporations of all kinds which are
Targe employers 6T labor wee making
preparations tonight to meet the
emergency which a general strike
would bring. Many of them have ar
ranged an automobile service which
spill be operaAed on a regular sched
ule. They have distributed printed
cards among their employes directing
them to be at certain sorners at a
stated time to board the cars which
will be provided,. Other companies
hale engaged blocks of rooms in ho
tels and hoarding houses for their
workers
Cars Hooted and Hissed.
As the night advanced disorder in
creased along the lines of the New
York railway. Every car which passed
was hooted and hissed. Many raws
ran their cars direct to the barns, re
fusing to take on passengers.
Police Commissioner Arthur Woods
and Inspector Schmittberger patrolled
the entire system, giving orders to
commanding qiTicers stationed at stra
tegic points. Ten thousand policemen
are being kept on duty in various
police stations, each man being held
with the reserves during his hours off.
Nine hundred men on vacations and
D00 at the Fort Wadsworth training
camp have been recalled.

ers 145 miles, employs 3,100 motormen
and conductors and carries 750,000
passengers daily.
