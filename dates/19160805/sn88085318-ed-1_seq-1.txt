STATE INSTITUTIONS.
Being one of a series of 12 spe
cial articles for the Examiner,
prepared by W. H. Cocliran, mem
ber of the state board of control.
A state school to be known as the
Washington School for Defective
Youth was established on Feb. 3,
1880, its purpose being to educate
the deaf, blind and feeble minded
youth of the state of Washington.
The location of the school was fixed
at Vancouver, in Clarke county. The
school was made free to all resident
youth in the state of Washington who
were too deaf, blind or feeble minded
to be taught by ordinary methods in
other public schools; provided, how
ever, that they were free from vicious
habits and from loathsome or contagi
ous diseases.
The school was placed under the
management of a board of trustees,
consisting of five persons, to be nom
inated by the governor, and the ap
pointments to be such that the board
should always contain at least one
practical educator, one physician and
one lawyer. The trustees were em
powered to select a director of the
school, who should be an expert edu
cator of defective youth, a hearing
man of sound learning and morals,
not under thirty nor over seventy
years of age, and practically ac
quainted with the school manage
ment and class instruction of the
deaf, blind and feeble-minded.
If the parent, guardian or next
friend of any defective youth residing
in the state, is, by reason of poverty,
unable to pay the cost of transporting
such youth to and from the school,
then, on satisfactory proof of such in
ability being presented to the county
commissioners in the county where
such youth resides, they shall issue to
the parent or guardian a certificate
ordering the county to pay the ex
pense of such transportation.
A law was passed in 1890 requir
ing the clerks of all school districts
in the state to report to the school
superintendents of their counties the
names of all deaf youth residing
within their respective districts who
are between the ages of six and twen
ty-one years. The county school su
perintendent shall then report to the
county commissioners the names of
all such youth on the first day of
July of each year and shall transmit
a duplicate copy to the superintend
ent of the state school.
The sum of $7,000.00 was appro
priated by the legislature to sustain
the school, but no provisions for the
purchase of ground or the erection of
suitable buildings were made. To
meet this emergency several public
spirited members of the Vancouver
Board of Trade collected funds suffi
cient to purchase 100 acres of land
and to build a small plain building.
The property was afterward exchang
ed for seventeen acres of land, and in
1887 the present main building was
erected. The school building for the
feeble-minded was erected about a
half-mile distant, and what is now
the School for the Blind was erected
in 1891.
On April Ist, 1901, the School for
Defective Youth came under the con
trol and jurisdiction of the State
Board of Control, the present Govern
or, Ernest Lister, then being chair
man of that board. In its first re
port of this Institution to the legisla
ture, the board made a recommenda
tion that the feeble-minded children
be removed to another location and
that the deaf children be located in
one building and the blind children
be moved to the building vacat
ed by the feeble-minded. All
of this recommendation has since
been carried out, although not
adopted at that time, and the
governor can look back with satisfac
tion and feel that his advice at that
time has been considered sound.
At that time the population of the
blind was so small that it was felt
that the one superintendent over both
the deaf and the blind would be suffi
cient. There were employed, five
teachers for the deaf, while one
teacher was all that was required for
the blind. The feeble-minded were
transferred to Medical Lake in May,
1906, and at the same time the blind
children were transferred to the
building vacated by them, and th.-
deaf remained in the location which
they at the present time occupy.
On January Ist, 1906, Thomas P.
Clarke was appointed as superintend
ent of the School for the Deaf and the
Blind, and he still remains as super
intendent of the School for the Deaf..
The Board of Control In l'J^'J rec
ommended that the deaf and the
blind be placed under separate heads,
and this was done, in a way, yet the
law of segregation was not passed un
til 1913, when one school became
known as the School for the Deaf and
the other as the School for the Blind.
The regular term at the School for
the Deaf begins on the second Wed
nesday of September and closes on
the second Wednesday of the follow
ing June. The State Board of Con
trol may admit to this school deaf
children from other states, but the
parents or guardians of such children
are required to pay annually or quar
terly in advance a sufficient amount
to cover the cost of maintaining and
educating such children. It is the
duty of parents or guardians of all
deaf children to send them each year
to the State School for the Deaf. The
county superintendent must take all
action necessary to enforce this un
less she or he has satisfactory evi
dence that any deaf child is being
properly educated at home or in some
other suitable institution.
The day schools for the deaf which
have been opened in some of our larg
er counties have taken nearly one
hundred children who would other
wise tome to this school.
At our School for the Deaf, we use
the American combined system of in
struction under which alt known
methods and the variations are used
for the attainment of an object com
mon to all. Speech, and speech read
ing, commonly called the "lip lan
guage,' arc considered very import
ant, ihf acquisition of language and
gen* ral knowledge are regarded as
still more important. So far as cir
cumstances permit, such method Is
ohosen for each pupil as seems best
adapted to his needs and capacity.
Our rule is that adopted by the Amer
ican instructors of the Deaf In con
vention assembled: "Any method
for nood results; all methods, and
Wedded to none." We are getting
Intelligent speech and speech reading
from about 60 per cent of our child
ren In no case has a child's speech
deteriorated while attending this
school.
lii June, 1913, we graduated the
largest class in the history of the
school, ten in number. Of these, sev
en went to i;.ill-Mi.ii i College at
Washington, D. C. As we then had
thr"'' of our graduates attending this
collie, the entrance of this class
raisnd our representation there to
ten. and gave us second place in point
of numbers, Nebraska taking first
(lace with twelve. Our school Is very
proud of this record, and also of that
made by our students at Gallaudet,
our pupils being at, or near the head
of every class in which we are repre
sented.
We class the industrial depart
ment of our school equal in import
ance to the literary. The handicap of
deafness makes it difficult, If not im
possible for graduates to secure jobs
unless they have acquired a start
while at school.
It Is our aim to teach each child
'he rudiments of some trade and such
habits of Industry as will enable him
to support himself after graduation.
Ho far, we are able to nay, with a good
deal of pride, that none of our gradu
ates has ever become a charge on the
public purse, either as an inmate of
ilie poor house or a jail. While our
graduates do not always follow the
trade taught at the school, still they
have learned to work while here, and
most of them become taxpayers very
soon after leaving school.
Both boys and girls are taught to
make up beds, sweep and take care of
rooms. The children do all of the
*ork In their dormitory buildings un
■ !er competent supervision. Most are
lessons In cooking. We have
■ lasses In domestic science, cooking,
dressmaking, cutting and fitting,
printing, leather work and wood
working. All of our repairs during
the term are done by the classes. In
idental Instruction is given in
plumbing, steam-fitting, concrete,
non and tin work and painting.
The average cost per capita of the
sixty-four state institutions for the
deaf In the United States is about
$390 per annum. Our cost is $292
per year of 366 days.
Pupils are not servants, and where
1 lie service of a pupil is desired, re
quest must be made of the superin
tendent. Every officer, teacher and
■ mploye is expected to study and be
i ome acquainted with the methods of
< ommunlcatlng with the deaf and pre
ferment will depend in a measure
upon the abllllty of coming In closer
touch with the pupils. Orally train
ed pupils must be taked to, while the
. Iphabet and signs should be used
ireely In intercourse with scholars
hi the manual department.
Kindness is the underlying princi
ple of discipline in this school and
must be the prompting of all rela
tions between authority and service
between officers, teachers, employes
md the pupils. Corporal punishment
ll prohibited. Pupils must not leave
the grounds without authority of the
uperlntendent. Boys are not per
mitted on the girls' playground. No
tobacco or spirits are tolerated.
I have already mentioned that we
use the American combined system
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
The progressive party of this
state in mass convention at Seat
tle last Saturday decided by a de
ciaive vote to maintain all its
state and county organizations, to
continue the national organisation,
and to induce candidates to file
on thc> progressive ticket in state
and counties. A resolution was
passed providing that where there
was no progressive county ticket,
an examination be made to deter
mine the progressives on other
tickets and support them.
The convention refused to sup
port Hughes for the republican
nomination, evidently on the
ground that he was not progres
sive. Wilson was announced as
having given this country much
progressive legislation, and the
prohibition candidate Ifunly was
stated to be progressive.
The national progressive party
is making arrangement! to com
plete their national ticket, the
leaders of the party refusing to
accept dictation from the moneyed
interests or to return to the stand
pat element which they left four
years ago.
While M, E, Durham of Seattle
is not considered a politician, yd.
In- has shown unusual campaign
ability in his race for the office
of state superintendent of public
instruction. In King county,
where Durham lias occupied al
most every position from rural
teacher to city teacher and county
superintendent of schools, he will
poll an overwhelming majority of
(he voles. The country .school
patrons declare .Mr. Durham to lie
the creator of modern and better
conditions in their schools and the
business and professional men of
the county are demanding a state
administration of more practical
and business-like nature such as
Durham has demonstrated in his
handling the affairs of King
county schools. Those who claim
to know are outspoken in their
expression of confidence in his
election.
for instruction. The two prominent
methods of teaching the deaf, known
as the silent or manual method, and
the oral or speech method, were
started at the same time ahout IC7O.
A controversy immediately sprung
sprung up between the adherents of
•acb and has not ceased yet. Tin;
schools in Europe were divided, some
using one of these methods and some
using the other, and both doing
good work and getting good results.
It remained, however, for the Ameri
can schools to recognize the good
points of both methods and to unite
them in what is known as the Ameri
can combined system, which is used
in this school.
There la In Washington, D. C, the
only college for the deaf in the world.
Oullaudet College Is supported by the
national government and its gradu
ates are doing business and making
good in every part of the United
States. The state pays the expenses
to Washington and return of any of
the graduates of the state school.
The uniformly cheerful resignation
and gentle obedience of these unfor
tunate little ones entitles them to
the most generous fostering care on
the part of the state. The happy dis
position of the children is amazing
and in their play they rival all chil
dren with full hearing.
The School for the Deaf is situated
upon a tract of land containing a lit
tle over 17 acres, and it lies about a
mile and a half from the business of
the city of Vancouver. The outlook
ip strikingly beautiful; the build
ings face the south and are on a
bench about 125 feet above the sur
face of the Columbia river and in full
view of Mt. Hood
The administration building occu
piew about tte center of the tract.
The foundation and walls of the
building are brick, but Is a rookery,
and has long been considered un
sanitary and a menace to the health
and the lives of the pupils. The
building hap outlived its usefulness
to a great extent, and a new up-to
date and firfe-proof administration
and school building Hhould bo pro
vided by the legislature.
The east and west wings of tho
Ijiiililihk contain the hospital, lady
ti in hers' rooms, school rooms and
bed rooms for the night watch. Back
of and attached to the main building
are the chapel and dining roomu. Ad-
