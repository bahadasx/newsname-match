" From Chloride Section Dailr Miner.
Arrangements have been perfected
for reopening the old Silver Hill prop
erties, which traverse the ridge imme
diately west of the town. It is also
reported that the Juno, which is the
northward continuation of the Silver
Hill and which has a fine production
record, will also start up at an early
date. With the whistles blbwing on
both sides of us, Chloriders ought to I
be able to wake up early in the morn-!
ing.
The Silver Hill vein is well defined
for a long distance, various from two
to 12 feet in width, and, like the big
mines on the other side of the valley,
dips sharply to the east.
It has been opened by a series of
shafts from 50 to 600 feet in depth,
and was one of the first properties
worked in the district. The ore car
ries gold, silver and lead in paying
quantities, and the entire vein from
the southern end of the ridge north to
the Moose is regarded by old miners
bere as one of the best in the camp.
L
From Oatman Section Dailr Hlntr.
A second fine looking stringer, a
foot wide, has been cut by the Arizona-Central
shaft at a depth of 230
feet. It greatly resembles the seven
foot vein at th6 200. Superintendent
W. H. Hart has had the stringer as-
saved and received returns auite simi
lar to the others, which averaged $5.48 1
a ton.
The shaft is sinking at a rate of 150
feet a month. Last week it went down
36 feet At that rate it will soon be
down where the other mines of that
zone struck ore, and to that class the
Central seems certain of belonging, as
only depth appears to be needed to
make it a mine.
ORGANIZED LABOR
SOON TO ESTABLISH
COOPERATIVE STORE
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
Organized labor of Oatman, through
its Central Labor union, has inaugu
rated steps looking to the early es
tablishment there of a cooperative
general store in an effort to reduce
the cost of living. The body named,
at a recent meeting, adopted the fol
lowing resolutions in connection with
the plan:
Whereas, We cooperate for the ben
efit of our fellow workers, their fami-i
lies, and the general well being of hu-1
manity, always demanding the wage
scale that will afford a decent stan
dard of living, and
Whereas, Organized labor in Oat
man, and the San Francisco mining
district, have stood solidly together
for wages, hours' and working condi
tions for all locals affiliated with the
Oatman Central Labor union, thereby
establishing the fact that the dele
gates to our body are aggressive and
constructive, and fully able to fur
ther our cause in more ways than
the above mentioned; therefore, be it
Resolved; That we continue our co
operative and constructive work in
raising our standard of living by per
fecting and establishing a cooperative
store in our midst, thereby cutting
down the high cost of living; and, be
it further
Resolved; That a committee of five
be appointed to draft lines of orga
nization, and deteremine the advisa
bility by facts and figures thereby
proving to the public generaly its
benefits; and, be it further
Resolved; That a copy of these reso
lutions be sent to each local affili
ated with the Central Labor union,
and ask that they take the matter
up and adopt; and, be it further
Resolved; That copies be furnished
the local press for publication.

BLACK RANGE ROAD
FINISHED TO SHAFT
From Taundaj'a Dailr Mlaer
The Black Range has put the final
touches on its road to the new shaft.
The road is over 500 feet long and a
fairly easy grade, but on account of
hard formations considerable blasting
and heavy rock work was required.
All that remains to do now is to
sink the shaft. It has been started
and is down' seven feet. It will be
driven rapidly to a depth of -600 feet,
where the ledges are supposed to
come together and form an ore shoot
that can be mined and milled at a
profit without further sinking and a
minimum of lateral work. '
ETO
BE READY THIS MONTH
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
The building of the new county high
way over the Goldroad hill is making
good headway and should be complete
and in use within the next 30 days,
There is still a little to do on the east
grade and considerable on the west
Heavy blasting and rapid work are
going on apace on that part of the
road and the grade has been broken
down and marked out in a general
way almost to completion down as fas
as Goldroad town. It is mostly clean'
ing up, smoothing and surfacting that
remain to be done to make the road
ready for teams and autos.
It is a twisted route, but a good
easy grade and most machines can
make it in high gear. It is far dif
ferent from the present grade, which
in one place is claimed to be SO pet
event and which has made many an
auto turn back and go into the gar
ages to have their clutches tightened.
Coming down has its dangers as well
as going up.
The recent rains are a great help
in putting the new road in condition.
They do more in a day to solidify the
surface than men can do in a month.
The people of Oatman feel grateful
to the county supervisors for this road
and wish them a subsequent triumph
ant career of the same order closer
home which they feel certain of wit
nessing as things shape themselves for
it in due course of time and as favor
able financial arrangements will
justify.
A HOME COMPANY
The Wallapai Lighting and Power
company has been incorporated with a
capital of $50,000, and the following
officers elected: Robert Roe, presi
dent; A. Fay, vice president; A. L.
Cox, secretary; R. C. Van Denberg,
treasurer. These officers, with Wil
liam Hall and C. K. Chilberg, consti
tute the directory.
The new company has taken overJ
the small lighting plant installed by
Mr .Roe and is already furnishing
light to several business houses. The
promoters say they will soon install
heavier machinery and be in shape to
meet all demands for light or power.
BUYS MACHINERY
The Sullivan Machine company has
sold to the Schuylkill company a com
pressor and drill sharpener, which will
be shipped to Chloride today. The
company has a large engine at the
mine that will be used to drive the
compressor. The equipment of the
company is said to be the most com
plete of any in the . county.
HEAVY FALL OF RAIN
THROUGHOUT COUNTY.
The rainstorm of yesterday after
noon was general over the county, the
greatest fall of the year occurring be
tween Kingman and Oatman. All the
washes ran bank full and the roads in
places show considerable washing, es
pecially on the mountain grades.
The storm extended to the Colorado
river and fully 100 miles north and
south. It was one of the most valua
ble the county has been favored with
for many months, as it will not only
bring up the new grass, but it will
also allow of the dragging of all the
well traveled roads.
FISTIC ENCOUNTER.
A fistic encounter took place on
Front street yesterday afternoon that
was short and sweet. One of the par
ticipants drew a punch in the eye, as
well as a badly lacerated nose.
T
LEVEL IN DISTRICT
From Chloride Section Dally Miner.
On the 1650-foot level of No. 3 shaft
of the Goldroad mine drifts have been
started both northwest and southeast
in what is believed to be an excellent
showing for making an ore shoot.
The crosscut was run 180 feet and iri
the past 40 or 50 feet various string
ers have been cut. For about 12 feet
the rock extracted has been a sort of
ledge matter, but there is a distinct
Uncertainty and difference of opinion
as to whether or not the hanging wall
has been reached.
The miners who have worked there
for half a dozen years have gathered
notions of their own from experience
in the mine and naturally would like
to see the crosscut continued until the
hanging wall is known to have been
found. On the other hand, the engi
neering advice is to start drifting at
once which has been done in the past
day or two and it is making speed
under the usual energetic direction of
Manager D. R. Muir.
While this is a greater depth than
it is generally known that a Goldroad
or Oatman mine had reached, No. 3
shaft is 250 feet higher at the sur
face than No. 1, the latter being the
main working shaft, and thus the
depth, in reality, is considered to be
1400 feet. No. 1 is used to hoist all
the ore and is a three-compartment
shaft No. 3 is used for letting down
timbers and for lowering and hoisting
the miners.
WINZE IN PIONEER
IS YIELDING ORE
A winze that is all in good ore is
being put down at a point 500 feet
south of the shaft on the ,400-foot
level of the Pioneer. The value of the
ore is uncertain, but it is not less than
$13 to $15 a ton.
The winze has been sunk 30 feet
and is being sunk as rapidly as possi
ble to prove up this shoot which is the
most important one in the present
workings. It was struck about six
weeks ago, being recorded in detail at
the time by the Daily Miner.
ELECTRIC LINE
Lightning damaged the Desert Pow
er company line between Oatman and
Kingman yesterday afternoon at 2:30,
shutting down the Tom Reed mine and
mill and extinguishing all lights in
Oatman. In consequence, the post
office clerks could not distribute in
coming mail, so none was delivered.
Western Union, Postal and telephone
lines were also out of business several
hours.
CLOSES BLIND PIGS.
Deputy Sheriff Mackey closed up
three "blind pigs" Monday night at
Mazona, merely giving the owners no
tice to quit On account of inability
to convict, no prosecutions were at
tempted. The water interests
Reed Gold Mines company and the
Times Mining company have been
consolidated. The deal resulted from
a trip of W. F. Gray, manager of the
latter company, to Los Angeles,
whence he returned yesterday.
The terms of the deal as yet are
private, but since the Times has the
long nd of the water, relieving a
shortage of the Tom $ed, it is pre
sumed that the long end of the cash
consideration of the deal favors the
Times.
For nearly a month past the Tom
Reed has been using the Times water
under a temporary arrangement. This
is said to have been on gallon meter
measurement, at a rate not far below
the prevailing commercial rates for
water.
In the meantime the Tom Reed

BIG MONEY GOING
TO DAT M A N IN FALL,
SAYS HI. A. BROOKS
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.)
"In the fall there is going to be
some real big- money here. That what
we had before was only chicken feed."
W. A. Brooks, a mining man who
has various local interests, including a
large block of stock and directorship
in the Oatman North Star, after a
week at San Francisco, made the
above remark yesterday to the Daily
Miner correspondent.
"It is not going to be small change
this time, like we got last winter from
Los Angeles, but real money, big
money. Things will be altogether dif
ferent when it comes, and this camp
will be livelier than it ever was be
fore." Mr. Brooks says the Big Jim's
riches are attracting a world of at
tention at San Francisco. He was one
of the local mining men who took ad
vantage of the invitation to see the
mine on visitors' day, and thereby was
conversant with the subject and able
to answer inquiries accurately and sat
isfactorily. The North Star has been working i
with a sprung piston rod for about a
month, but is now shut down while re
pairs are being madcKjt the Tom Reed
machine shop. These will be finished
and the plant will be at work again in
a day or two, Mr. Brooks states.
ON CHLORIDE LINE
A washout, to a torrential rain
storm, fpur and one-half miles south
of Mineral on the Chloride branch of
the Santa Fe railroad caused the an
nulment of No. ?6 yesterday after
noon. The officials at Needles order
ed the train returned to Chloride,
where it remained over night
Tlie washout was about 200 feet
long and left the bare rails and ties
standing. The track will be placed
in shape today.
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE
TO SPEAK HERE TONIGHT.
A. A. Worsley, an attorney of Tuc
son, is in Kingman on legal business
and to renew old acquaintances and
make new friends. He is seeking the
democratic nomination for representa
tive in congress. He will speak at
Chloride this morning and here this
evening, lie spoKe to a large crowd
in Oatman last evening.
JACKLING TO BUILD
HOME IN COAST CITY
Colonel D. C. Jackling, one of the
heaviest owners of stock in the United
Eastern, is about to erect a palatial
home at San Francisco to cost $500,
000. It will be located at the corner
of Octavia and Washington streets.
The site is occupied by the old Hecht
residence, which is being removed.
Frank A. Keith Seeley Mudd and
Colonel Jackling control Oatman's
greatest mine, George Long and J. L.
Mclver of Oatman, being major stock
holders.
Charles Crosby was brought in from
Oatman yesterday by Thomas Hunter,
suffering from delirium tremens.
E
WATER
INTERESTS
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
of the Tom company has secured .additional water
from the new company organized by
V. S. Rowley and associates, and now
makes permanent its arrangement or
a modification of its former arrange
ment with the Times.
The-Times water comes from Grape
vine canyon and was purchased at an
outlay understood to be upward of
$25,000, for the use of the Times town
site and mine. There has been a much
further outlay for pumping and piping
the water to the town and mine, which
was completed only at the moment the
Tom. Reed well failed and all of the
surplus was required to fill the needs
of the Tom Reed mill and the people
of Oatman.
It is known that the deal means a
great deal for the companies interest
ed and is said to have further signifi
cance that will develop later.
IS
A report comes from Stockton Hill i
that a strike of ore has been made
on the Fraction claim of the Kingman
Zinc company that gives promise of
great things. The ore across three
feet of vein gave return of better than
$65 gold per ton in gold and silver.
The tunnel on the Shooting Star
wjll be driven ahead, getting under
the ore body at a depth of several
hundred feet The distance to be run
is about 100 feet, the tunnel now be
ing in quite a distance on the vein.
The management is making all possi
ble speed to reach the ore body, ex
pecting to cut it not later than Sep
tember 1. B. X. Dawson, who has
been at the head of the corporation, is
now in Chicago conferring with assocr
ates on future operations of the
property.
HEAVY RAIN FLOODS
STREET
A heavy rain yesterday between 1
and 2 o'clock filled Main street with
flood water and gave the St Francis
hotel's ditch its first real baptism. The
ditch crosses the street diagonally, and
after keeping the water out of the St
Francis it spreads it out equitably as
it passes down the street beyond the
"jitney" park.
Unusually heavy blasts of thunder
were heard throughout the storm,
some of the lightning flashes seeming
to trim the whiskers of the old-timers,
but no other harm was reported.
BACK FROM MEETING
OF STATE TAX BODIES
Frank L. Hunt, who has been at
tending the. session of the tax bodies
at Prescott, returned home yesterday,
coming in by way of Los Angeles. He
is a candidate for reelection to the
office of assessor of Mohave county,!
and so far has no opposition for the
office.
Mr. Hunt and his deputies know
more about property values in the
county and the location of taxable
property than it is possible to be gain
ed by any other person in several
years of service and the people will
do well to see that there is no change.
Under his assessorship Mohave coun
ty has grown from a county with tax
able values of $1,500,000 to its present
valuation of $16,000,000, the greatest
growth of any county in the state.
ELECTRICITY OSED TO
E
An electrical method of purifying
water for drinking has been trans
planted into Oatman by the efforts of
Black brothers, real estate agents,
which it is claimed is a sure preven
tive for bacteria or germ sickness
where water is of dubious character.
The system consists of treating wa
ter by electricity, which is called the
electrolysis method. The electricity
passes through the water and liberates
nascent oxygen, some times called
ozone, kills bacteria and germ life,
precipitates the vegetable and animal
matter but leaves the mineral matter
in solution. As these natural salts
are so necessary for the health of
the body, it is claimed to be much
more healthful than is distilled water.
The water becomes very soft
After electrical treatment the water
is doubly filtered by a special filtra
tion process. In this way all dead
bacteria, vegetable and animal matter
is completely removed. The third step
is a secret process .while the fourth
consists of thoroughly aerating the
water, which makes it still more
healthful.
Recently Black brothers correspond-jo
ed with Prof. A. E. Denison, bio-
chemist of the University of Arizona,!
who writes: !
"I am familiar with the method of
purifying water which you mention,
having seen it in operation at the San
Diego exposition last summer. The
method was examined by Dr. Meserve
here in the laboratory of the state
board of health. He mixed city sew
age with the water and treated it with
this method. The purification was
very satisfactory."
ACQUIRE
OF THE SONNYSIDE
The sale of a controlling interest in
the Sunnyside property has been ef
fected at Los Angeles, the outstand
ing feature being that Seeley Mudd,
of the United Eastern, and John Wise
man, who has figured in past deals of
that company, are the purchasers. The
consideration is understood to be
around $85,000.
The Sunnyside lies just to the south
and east of Telluride. The main ledge
of the camp, which has made the Tom
Reed and United Eastern mines,
passes through the Telluride and un
doubtedly the Sunnyside.
It is rumored that A. H. Woolacott
negotiated the deal.
FIRE BOYS' SMOKER
The Oatman fire department gave
a smoker last night at the Desert Inn
theatre. It was largely attended. A
character of entertainment in keeping
with the importance of the event was
furnished by the enterprising firemen.
Included in the list were a couple of
bouts by local boxers who have had
on the gloves quite a few times for the
fun of the thing.
IMMENSE SH1P3IENT
OF CORRUGATED IRON.
Four big freight wagon loads of
corrugated iron were despatched by
the Lovin and Withers companv Sun
day and yesterday to the United East
ern, company at Oatman. The iron
will be used in the erection of the new
mill. The entire consignment totalled
12,000 squares or ,200,000 square
feet It was the largest single ship
ment of corrugated iron ever delivered
by a business house in Mohave county.
ATHLETIC EVENTS' AT
'SS
From Olio ride Section Dailr Miner.
A wrestling match and six two
round bouts, a draw resulting in each
and every case, constituted a string of
coincidents seldom equaled on any
stage, but that is how it all happened
and came out at the Oatman fire de
partment smoker at the Desert Inn
theater Monday night
The wrestling match was between
Fagan and O'Neill and was a "hum
dinger." The participants are light
weights and as lively on their feet as
kittens. They would have given the
audience a run for its money if a sub
stantial cash admission had been
charged.
The fistic artists, all local, form a
galaxy of talent that few cities the
size of Oatman could boast of. Ben
Swartz and Lyston Black gave one of
the exhibition contests. Others fol
lowed quickly, as follows: Joe Ryan
versus Freddy Krause, Harry Sim
monds versus R. L. Booth, George Le-
f?mnr1 vprsiis Paul TTines. 'Rert Tnl-
Mulrain versus William E. Hanssen.
Piano selections were rendered to
the satisfaction of all by "Smithy", a
local musician of rare talent.
A gold badge for Retiring Chief
W. R. Fleming was presented to him
in a neat speech by Secretary W. K.
Smith, of the chamber of commerce.
President Merle Bowman called on
all those present for speeches and
adopted a sort of freeze-out system to
punish recalcitrant ones. The punish
ment was to not serve them refresh
ments when others were served, and
there were several "horrible ex
amples" to whom this penalty was
meted out Most every one made
some sort of a speech after the penal
ties commenced to take effect Among
the speakers were President Bowman,
Chief Harry Simmonds, Captain O. M.
Brockless and Secretary Lyston Black.
It was accepted as the consensus of
opinion of the attendants that these
get-together smokers should be held
oftener, the hope being to establish
cooperation between the people of
Oatman and the firemen. It takes
money to give smokers, but it is be
lieved that the results are more than
wor. the the cost
ATM AN PARTY WILL
VISIT WHITE MOUNTAINS
A half dozen of Oatman's pleasure-
lovers will depart soon for a three
weeks' vacation in the White moun
tains on the New Mexico line, north
east of Flagstaff. In the party will
be Mr. and Mrs. C. R. Parrott, Mr. and
Mrs. J. W. Ryan, Miss Laura Richert
and Paul Morton. They leave the rail
way at Holbrook and go thence to
Springerville, proceeding to the moun
tains. It is said to be a very wild
country, with wild turkeys, speckled
trout and big game galore.
