"Hello, Sport!"
A reporter for the Farmer who
was watching a very interesting
game of baseball betweeh Covington
and the Dokay Teas at St. Paul's
stadium, last Sunday, looked to see
who the sport was. He *saw Felix
Bachemin, Dr. Marrero and several
others whom he knew, and some la
dies he did not know, but nobody
who could be called a sport.
"Hello Sport!"
Again the Farmer man turned his
head. He saw a very nice little girl
smiling sweetly, but where was the
sport?
IBut when a string of young men
passed, all hailing wit , "Hello,
Sport!" it 'began to be ihteresting,
and as F. '. Planche was passng at
that time with the same salutation,
the Farmer man asked him who it
was everybody was addressing as
"'port."
"Why, that's Mlas Martin. She's
the young lady that made the mile
and a half swim this morning from
Sulphur Springs to the Bogue Falaya
(Park. Want to meet her?
The Farmer man found Miss tMar
tin very pleasant and just brimming
over with love of athietics spirts,
She was especially fond of' swimming
.and said that if she had known that
Covington had such a fine swimming
place nothing could have kept her
away from this beautiful little towr
and the nice people. She had en
joyed herself very much and regreted
that she was leaving on the after
noon train. After some persuasion
Miss Martin consented to have a
picture taken for the Farmer.
IMr. A. Martin, her father, and
Messrs. Felix Bachemin, Sr., and Fe
lix IBachemin, 'Jr., who were with
her, drove the party to the beautiful
Bachemin home on the Military road,
where the picture was taken in the
bathing suitt Miss Martia wore when
she made the swim.
IMr. Bachemin has an ideal country
home qn the Military road, a short
distance from Covington. itis dairy
is one of nce hiagl-'-ss modern ones.

thirty cows next season with no cow

eliminated. Mayor Lacroix stated
that he would have the town marshal
flag the approaching passenger trains
as he was always at the dppot wher
these trains came in.
There being no further business
