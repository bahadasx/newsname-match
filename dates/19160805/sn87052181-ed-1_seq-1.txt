To kill a Mnnta,
wlih'li In the scientific name for
j devilfish, perfect handling of the
I boat is necessary and a proper crew Is
I tho first consideration In equipping an
j expedition. In my 20 years' oxpcrl
I ence of llshing oft the coast ot North
Carolina, 1 bnvo always made up my
crew from tho nntlvo market fishermen,
In preference to tho guides nnd boat
men usually employed by sportsmen.
On this occasion, In addition to Oupt.
Charlie Willis, I was fortunutu In so
curing tho sen Ices of Capt. John Me
Cnnn of Punta Gorda, Fin., beyond
question the best-known and most effi
cient fisherman on the Florida const,
and he selected the three other mem
bers of tho crew all young men,
trained, active, nnd without fear. Cap
tain MeCnnn nlso furnished the boat.
which was a smnll O-foot, open boat
with an eight-horse power gasoline en
gine. Tho construction, however, of
this little boat was extra strong, or It
would have been wrecked by the terrl
flc pounding It received.
The men wero nearly perfect for the
positions which they were to till, know
ing what to do no matter what condi
tion might nrlse; therefore not much
time was required In training tho crew,
On such nn expedition It is necessary
for nvorv man to move instantly when
the word Is given, llko part of n per
feet machine, for I cannot turu my
head when the fight Is on.
When the boat passed out through
Captive Inlet Into tho Gulf of Mexico,
the water was so thick that a Mnnta
would havo hnd to rise to the surface
to lie seen, nnd I posted three men to
keep close watch, one on each side of
the boat, and ono behind Ms, while I
watched In front.
We had run down tho full length ot
the coast of Captive Island nnd were
about n mile off the shore of Sanlbel
Island and In front of Blind Pass,
when there came, suddenly nnd with
out warning, n most terrific shock,
which threw tho four of us who were
standing to our hnnds nnd knees for a
fraction of a second. The boat, which
was running nt full speed, had met the
head of a Mnnta, rising to tho surface
and coming toward us at moderate
sliced. Tho shock of the collision wns
so great that it nlmnst stopped the
headway of the boat, and its bow was
lifted more than n foot out of tho wa
ter ; but our speed carried the iioat up
over tho high part of the back of llu
j Mantn just as the two great black fins
wero Hung luully Into the air, nlmnst
meeting over our heads and deluging
us with many gallons of water. Thru
the two tins crashed down on tho sur
facb of the sea with a noise that could
havo been heard for miles, and tho
Mantn Instantly repeated tho perform
ance as I yelled to the engineer, "Keep
her going." Just ns the boat was slid
ing from tho hack of the creature, an
other hugo Mantn rushed up from be
low, striking full on our port bow with
sulllrlent force to spin tho boat nround
until Its direction was almost reversed.
At ono tlmo nil four of the grent black
pectoral tins were towering nbovo us,
nnd Inrgo quantities of wnter wero
Hung Into the boat. First the head anil
then tho stern of the boat was highest
ns It was pitched from side to side, and
then I heard Hie chug, chug, chug of
tho racing propeller blades ns they
gashed the tip of tho pectoral fin of
the first Mantn. The engineer kept the
engine going nt full speed, but tho pro
peller blades were not catching the wa
ter now, nnd for a short dlsitanco wo
were carried upon the broad backs ot
tho two monster devils of the sea.
I fully realized the danger, as did
every ono of tho men with me In that
little boat, but .-very man filled his
place perfectly nnd there was no out
Ingalts' Theory Wrong.
Somo years ngo Senator John Jnmea
Ingalls of Kansas wruto n poem called
"Opportunity." Ills theory was that
Opportunity knocked at your door but
once. Ills poem was ono of the most
beautiful In tho English language, but
his theory was all wrong. Tho per
Kns who havo the microbes of ambi
tion nnd Industry do not wait for Op
portunity to knock at the door, but
liuvu tho door wldo open and are out
on tho sidewalk or In tho street hunt
ing for Opportunity, and It, Is not diffi
1
ward show either of fear or excite
ment, for I had a crew composed of
men who show nt their best only in
time ot danger. Scarcely a word was
spoken until. In the midst ot n wild
upheaval of tho two madly frightened
Mnnta beneath us, tho boat was flung
from their backs and wns turning over,
when I shouted, "High side I" which or
der was Instantly obeyed, two of the
men, except for nil urin and a leg,
throwing themselves entirely out of the
boat.
The boat struck bead first and
shipped a lot of water over her bow,
but we wero now clear of the two Mnn
ta, who raced together on tho surface
for n short distance.
These two Mnnta appeared to havo
lost all fear of the boat and Its occu
pants; we were many times in touch
ing distance of them nnd they both
passed under tho boat several times.
Tho first wns n female, well nbovo 15
feet In width, and I was about to at
tack It, when I saw, nearly a mile
away, the largest Manta that I have
ever seen. It was on the surfnee so I
ran the boat down to It, and never
havo I wanted to kill any ono thing
quite as badly as I wanted to kill that
great fish, tor It was fully 2! feet In
width and must hae weighed not less
than 12,000 pounds. I wns uncertain
however, ns to Its gender, nnd n fe
male was absolutely necessary,
Sho was now .swimming on or near
tho surface with mate following, nl
most touching her all the time, and,
with all ready, wo moved to tho uttack.
As she was passing, quartering across
our bow, I gave tho word. Charlie and
I drove our harpoons deep Into her
broad back ; then, with n great splash
of her 11ns, she plunged below and
nliead. As the drogue was snatched
under, It threw water high In the air
and tho shock was so great that It
brought the great ray to the surfneo
In that awkward, wheeling, edgowlse
leap that Mantu make, after tho man
ner of n wheel turning over. Before
Its tall had reached the perpendicular,
I and all of my crew saw an embryo,
folded In cylindrical form, thrown high
in the air, und I heard Captain Jack
exclaim, "Did you seo that? Tho young
ono has u tall longer than tho old one!"
Tho embryo quickly unfolded Its llns
nnd, catching tho air horizontally, Its
descent was retarded until after the
mother fish hnd disappeared beneath
the surface.
When I bad hurled my harpoon and
reached behind me, tho spado lance
had been lnstnntly placed In my hand.
but as I saw thlrf embryo feebly Hup
plug on the surface, I passed back the
spado lnnco nnd yelled "Give me an
Iron, quick!" (the harpoon Is always
called an Iron) and while not llvo sec
onds wero taken In the exchange, thnt
was too long, for as I threw back my
hand to strike, the male swept tho em
bryo beneath the surfneo with one ot
Its fins.
I passed back tho harpoon nnd seized
tho spado lance, ns I saw the wounded
female, now on tho surface, charging
down on us nt highest speed. I was
forced to strike lnstnntly nnd thero
was not sufficient time to clenr up the
lino attached to tho lnnco handle, so
tho point of tho spado lnnco was slight
ly deflected, with tho result that tho

fatal spot was missed by n few Inches.
However, the force of the blow, which
was delivered wlt,h both hands without
relenslng the handle, wns so great, that
It depressed tho creature's head, and
tho head-on collision did not crash In
tho side of. tho boat as It probably
would have donu otherwise. The top'
of the bend struck tho bottom of the
boat, breaking tho lnnco handle short
oft against tho side, nnd I was conj
fronted with u very serious defect In
my equipment. I had acquired, by1
years ot work with the lance, such'
confidence In my ability to place It
where I desired that I bad not thought
It necessary to provide more than ono
spade lance; but now my fish was very
much alive nnd fighting mad nnd i
wns without n spade lance.
Tho wnter was so thick that tho
Mantn could not be seen until very
neur tho burfacc, but Charlie kept tho
slack of IiIh harpoon hauled in and tho
lino showed tho direction In which the
tlsh was traveling under water. Cap
tain Jack steered the boat, which was
kept running, and that It was well
handled Is shown by the fnct that not
onco In more than u dozen rushes did
the devilfish reach the surfuee without
finding our boat on her back. Each
time I drove the lnncp through her
heart or brain ono or more times, and
after tho Oght sho showed 23 such
wounds.
Through nil this fight there was ono
uncertain and disturbing factor that
wo wero not In a position to guard
against namely, that tho great male
mate of tho wounded Manta kept near
us until the light was over and three
times nearly capsized us by pushing
tho boat from the back of tho female.
Once, Just after wo had been nearly
capsized by a heavy blow from tho
bead of tho male, anil when tho female
was lighting most violently, when wo
were nil covered with the blood of our
victim nnd the boat was almost filled!
with water, the youngest member of
tho crew (Luther Dixon), thinking that
the end for nil of us was near, tried to
force u harpoon Into my hand ns he
screamed, "Iron the big bull nnd let's
nil go to h In tow of a team ot
devils !" I quoto this to show tho tern
per of tho men, for while Luther, nnd
probably others of tho crew, thought
this our last fight, neither be nor any
other man showed even n trace of feur,
Then the dying Mantu raised her head
against tho side of the boat and gave a
loud harsh bark or cough, and ns I ex
claimed, "Watch her eyes looking two
wnys nt once!", tho stricken creature
slowly rolled ono ot her eyes, until
with thnt ono only, she seemed to look
nt nil of ns behind her In tho boat.
Beforo striking tho Mantn I had
looked nt my watch and called out the
time, und ns the big fish died, I again
pulled It out nnd nskeil, "How long7"
Not ono of the crew placed tho tlmo of
tho light nt less than two hours and
when I told them that It had taken on
ly 22 minutes, they wanted to see If
the watch hnd not stopped. Tho light
wns now over, the grent femalo Manta
that wo had conio for was dead; but
thero was still a man-sized Job In front
ot us and wo at onco made tho tlsh
fast to our stern nnd headed for Blind
Pass, mora than n mile awny.

MADE BIG MISTAKE
TRAVELING MAN "GOT QAY" WITH
THE WRONG MAN.
Meant His Rcmsrks as a Joke, but
Sleepy Individual Whom Ho Had
Abuced Could Not See It
Tha Way.
A Columbus trnvellng man tells of
nn unusuut and humorous experlcnco
on the road down In south Ooorgla a
few days ago,
A Kilesmuu bad been working that
section nnd found business line. Cot
ton sales had been good and the folks
had money to buy his commodity and
did buy. So,' his work over and an
envelope stuffed with orders mulled In
the post office, lie, felt ln cxtraordluary
flue spirits when ho boarded tlie train
to go to tho next town.
The train stnrted oft und the sales
man stood on the back platform, smok
ing n good clgur und surveying tho
scenery with grent satisfaction. A
rather shiftless looking Individual was
leaning against a post near tho track,
a hundred yards or so from the depot.
Tho train had gathered eonsldernblu
momentum and was going fast when
it passed the post.
The halcsmun was in extraordinary
high spirits nnd his good humor had to
vent Itself some way; and it expressed
itself In this most unusual manner.
When the rnpldly-movlng train passed
tho shiftless-looking man the traveler
leaned off the platform, shook his fin
gers In tho other's faco nnd In tho
course of two or three hllnrlous sec
onds gave bltn his complete industrial
nnd personal history In terse, crisp
phrases. The traveling mnn wus smil
ing, und if the citizen hnd but known
It, his upparently derogatory remarks
wero really an expression of overflow
tug good nature nnd satisfaction with
the world, but the sleepy-looking man
couldn't seo anything In It but malice
of the most astonishing and unexpect
ed kind. I
To the traveling man's nstonlshment.
the sleepy-looking man, galvanized Into
life, started down the track at full
speed after the train, now going quite
fast. It was apparently nn unequal
race nnd the man on the platform was
lightly amused, although ndmlrlng the
other's pluck and endurance. In two
or three minutes, however, ho wns sur
prised to Hnd the speed of tho train

made another spurt. In Just a llttlo
