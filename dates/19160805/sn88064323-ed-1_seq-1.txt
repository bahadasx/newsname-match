CONGRESSMAN WHIT
P. MARTIN
Announces His Candidacy
For Re-election as a
Protection ist.
Two years ago a large majority
of the voters of this, the Third
Ooogre*sional District, resenting
the Free Trade Policy of the Dem
O rratic Party, as embodied in ihe
provisions of the Underwood Bill,
severed their connection with that
organisation, and joiued a party
that stood for the fair and ade
quate protection for all American
Industries.
Party ties are not lightly brok
en, and this step was not taken by
the voters of this District until
after careful considération and
due deliberation
Bnt when we were deserted by
those who stood pledged to pro
tect us, when our every interest
was attacked, and when the Un
derwood Bill, with one fell swoop,
placed our products upon the
"Free List," and ruin and disastrr
stared us in the face, self respect
and self preservation compelled os
to leave the Democratic Party,
and affiliate with a party for
whose principles we could stand,
and whose platform held out some
hope for the future.
Upon this dear cat issue of
Protection versus Free Trade, the
voters of the Third Cougiessional
District did me the distinguished
honor of electing me as their Rep
resentatlve in the 04 tu Congress
by a inijority of approximately
fifteen hnudred votes.
And, now, upon the eve of a
obange in the National Adminis
tration, the people of tbia District
are again called npon to decide
the issue of Protection verBns
Free Trade
The Democratic Party, in Na
tional Convention Assembled, has
again declared in favor of Fiee
Trade by endorsing the provisions
of the Uuderwood Bill, while the
Progressive and Republican Par
ties have both reaffirmed iheir be
lief in a protective tariff, fairly
and scientifically adjusted, bo as
to assure adequate piotection to
all American Industries, and
American Labor.
As the Representative in Con
gress of the Third Congressional
District, I have consistently advo
cated, voted and stood for protec
tion.
I favor the restoration of fair
and adequate duties upon sugar,
rice, lumber, corn, potatoes, oulons,
and all other products of this
State and Country, in need of pio
tection; and to this end I have
voted, and will continue to vote
and co operate with any Party
that Stands for the protection of
auch industries.
Having been duly declared the
nominee of the Progressive Part},
I now snbmit my candidaoy to the
people of the Third District upon
this issue, and if elected, I shall
devote my time and the limit of
oSy ability to the interest of the
District and people whom I now
represent, and whom 1 hope to
have the honor to represent in the
60(b Congress.

TICK LAW.
CnotnhutPd. I
We have noticed lately the eiui
meriug movement of antagoniem
to the dipping law crystalizing
into a political power and indu
ence that will greatly interfere
with the selection of our District
Judge and District Attorney this
Fall.

en
re
Why such insurgency should be!
encouraged is beyond our range of
political wisdom. Why its mill
tancy should be applauded by a
few prominent leaders in public!
life is one of those puzzles that
geneially destroys the usefulness
of the wise acre or prophet.
The dipping law was plaited on
the statute book as an insurance,
a protection of capital invited in
the young, still undeveloped stock
iudustiy It is tie response to
those whose pioneering woik hat
encouraged diversification and!
made the utilization of field, for
est, marsh laud and climate not j
only solve successfully the much
exploited diversification problem,
but made it a highly profitable as
set of the country.
Due to our mild climate and
winter pasturage, with the help of
trained specialists, experts from
the bureau of Animal Industry of
Washington, D 0, many thou
sands of dollars are now found in
vested in the breeding of graded
cattle and bogs, in cieameries and
dairy business. Protected by a
reasonable, sane chattel mortgage
law, even our banks and financial
institutions have loaucd and ad
vanced uaouey to these enterprises
and have given a substantial im
petus to the development of this
phase of farming diversification
Then, why, shonld the protec
tion to stock, the basis of a m w
industry, be menaced by misguid
ed citizens, victims of prejudices
and traditions!
If this nullifies'ion process,
started by these small planters,
should receive legal sanction by
our Coarts, you would not only
find the stock industry crippled,
bat forever prostrated by the
staggering blow. The fancy cat
tie breeder, the dairyman, the
beef cattle man is as mach enti
tied to protection, insurance and
consideration as the stock of mer
ebandise of the store keeper and
the capital and deposit of the
bank. The enforcement of the
dipping ordinance, the thorough
eradication of the cattle tick, is
the insurance, the protection, the
government owes to this invest
ment. No farmer has a right to
oppose progressive farming, en
lightenmentin agriculture and the
modern use of soil and land
Without an intelligent disposition
and distribution of faun products
no success can be attained on the
farm. The vocation would be fu
tile and destroy all interest in
farm life. The fattening of beef
cattle aud the other processes of
the cattle industry are merely the
conversion of forage and field feed
into meat which commands a
ready cash maikel. It means a
greater, a new independence of
the tiller of the soil. It intro
daces a diversification of farm
life and occupation. Because it
does vioieuce to custom snd tradi
lions, to passion and prejudice is
no reason why obsolete aud effete
sparks of a senile ci viliz »I ion
shonld not be extinguished We
bave as yet, though, to see aud
bear a registeied protest from
those prominent in the industrial
and commercial field of town and
parish against this tolerated ac
tive hostility to the tick law. It
seems to us, that a proven sanita
ry measure should be publicly en
dorsed by capitalist and captain
of industry. It would not be
amiss for the Chamber of Com
merce and the kindred bodies to
formulate resolutions of approval.
An organized campaign of educa
tion by men commanding the con
fidence and good will of the public
would contribute enormously to
the dissipation of existing "fric
tion. The effort is wortby s tbe at

ICE PLANT FOR
LOWER RARATARIA.
New Orleans, Aug : Tbe an
nouncement that the big capital
ists of New Orleans who recently
took over the Grand Isle Railroad
from the Gauadian owners, will
build an ice plant far down on the
lower coast and Barataria section,
is considered an* item of gre«test
importance to a series of Lo. isi
ana's most prolific industiies.
The vast and inex%austible sup
ply of oysters, fl-di, shell fish and
other sea foods, as well as vegeta
bles, can be shipped out by quick
dispatch service to interior points,
thereby enabling towns hundreds
of miles inland to get their fish
and oysters practically as early as
the consumer in New Orleans,
The plant will make 75 tons of ice
a day aud be the first ever estab
lished in that territory

THE MKE CMP.
The cane crop is now forging
ahead wonderfully well, and the
previous good <prospects are be
coming highly accentuated and
tbe realization seems to have
come to every one in tbe Louisiana
sugar district that 1910 bids fan
to be a record breaker so far as
tbe excelleuce of tbe crop is con
cerned, though unfortunately it
will bieak no records in total vol
ume because of the restricted
acreage in cane. Good rains, io
full abundance, fell daring the
week, aud there has been hot sail

Louisiana sugar district, just now,
