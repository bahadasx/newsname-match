the Washington government for en
largement of the powers of the com
mission, ll is believed that the re
pi-.- is generally satisfactory to the
administration and that negotiations
will pr ceed without delay. Acting
Secretary Polk would not discuss the
communication today, saying he had
not time to study it. General Car
ranza says in his note that the Mex
ican commissioners "preferrably" will
discuss the three points outlined in
the Mexican communication of July
14. which are withdrawal of Ameri- '
an tioops from Mexico, the framing
(if a protocol to cover further border
operations and an investigation o.f
w'.mt interests have promoted border
raids. State derartment officials af"
understood to regard this as at least
leaving the wav open for broader con
siderations such as they desire, should
the commission be successful in find
ing a solution for immediate prob
lems. '
It is possible that in notifying the
Mexican government of the appoint
ment ol the American commissioners
and the time and place of the con
ference. Mr. Polk will take the o--rasion
to indicate again ttiat the
Fniied States expects the conferee.-,
to be free from the close limitations
implied in the new Mexican note but
will avoid any detailed expression on
that point. The commission then
would be left to man out Its own
course unless Heneral Carranza had
some specific suggestion to offe.
There was nothing to indicate to
night that President Wilson had de
cided on the men who will represent
the United States on the commission.
He has had many names under con
sideration. It Is regarded as probable
that the American membership will
be such ns to conform in a general
wav to the Mexican delegation. Luis
Cabrera, who will head the Mexicans,
is minister of finance: tgnacio Donil
las is director of the Mexican depart
ment of commerce, and an engineer
by profession: Alberto Pan! is also
an engineer.
Maior Hoctiials who has been men
tioned as a possible selection for the
American i ommission. is an engineer
officer The fact that he is a soldier,
however, mrtv prevent bis selection
since no .Mexican oiucer nas oeen s
leeted. others mentioned include
members of the sucreme court and
persons not in government service
who are regarded as authorities on
commerce and finance
The Washington rovernrnept sees no
necessity for a neutral setting for the
conference and it is probable that the
discussion will be held in some city
near Washington.
The de facto government apparent
ly rejects the proposal that the com
mission consider other questions than
the military situation, and limits Its
discussions to the subjects originally
suggested by Carranza, withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico, lormu
lation of a protocol to cover opera
tions against bandits and investiga
tion of interests which may have pro
moted border raids. Whether this
will he satisfactory to the- United
States government has not been indi
cated. The note was in Spanish and,
when lie went to today's cabinet
meeting. Acting secretary Polk de
cline!' to discuss it until an official
translation could be made.
If it is accepted the next step will
bo negotiations between Polk and
Arredondo to fix the time and place
for meetings of the commissioners.
President Wilson already has under
consideration a score of names sug
gested for the American membership.-
Hope for an early solution of pend
ing differences was confidently ex
pected by Arredondo after leaving the
state department. He said he expect
ed to reach an agreement with Polk
by tomorrow as to the date and place
of meeting and that thereupon be
would wire the Mexican commission-
I ers
wit h the expectation that they
would he here in at least ten days.
He said Asbury Park, N, J. or Old
(Continued on Paee Two)
Of The Senate
and that a line must be drawn some
where. When it came to discrimina
tion in such a matter he argued. It
could not be left to the sfates and must
necessarily fall upon congress.
Senator Hardwick charged both par
ties with "playing to political expedi
ency," with child labor legislation, and
said he felt ashamed because his party
had favored it in the St. Louis plat
form. The bill, he declared, was direct
ed against, a purely democratic and
civil affair, wdiose regulation is the sole
power of the states. He said he was
earnestly in favor of just and humane
i child labor laws, but was confident the
I supreme court would hold the pending
measure unconstitutional if enacted
into law.
