Carrizal Murders.
Washington. An sr. 5. Senator Lewis,
the democratic whir, spoke in the sen

the administration made by Charles E.
Hashes in his speech accepting the re
publican presidential nomination. Re
publican strictures upon the adminis
tration's Mexican policy. Senator
Lewis denounced as "treasonable." He
charged that the clause of the repub
lican platform repudiating interfer-
the internal affairs of Mexico I
ersce in
was responsible for the massacre of
the troops at CarrizaL
I ays Carrial Attack to G. O. r.
"Not until the captains of the repub
lican party shot at the president ot
the United States, did the Mexican out
laws shoot at the soldiers of the Amer
ican president," he said. The plat
form declaration. Senator Lewis char
acterized as a "summons to Carranza
and Villa to revenge the entrance of
American soldiers into Mexico ami the
interference of America in her internal
affairs."
"It was the republican convention,"
said Mr. Lewis, "which slew the sol
diers at Carrizal." and he assailed ef
forts of the republican leaders to
make Mexico the issue, "without re
gard to facts, equity or justice."
Hold Country to JUdtoile.
Revolt against the government at j
Washington as to Mexico that is the
issue Senator Iewis declared.
"Denounce the president as to Mex
ico for that is the issue," he contin
ued. "Make contemptible your own
country before the world whenever
you ran for that is the issue. Hu
miliate your own fellowman by hold
ing his country and his president up
before t!
world as tin worthy the sup
port of his countrymen or the respect
of foreigners.
Scores Hnches and Party.
"At last the army is summoned. The
mercenary the concessionaire, who
pollutes the government in power to
wrest the rights from the defenseless
and the weak. The European bond
holder demanding of the sovereign
United States that she shall send her
sons to die that their blood may give
value to that whose creation was born
it robbery and whose existence is be
ing maintained by fraud. The mining
bucranneers of the mountains, the
land pirates of the plains, pillagers of
the peon, oppressors of liberty, de
ppoilers of homes, murderers of jus
tice, come all of you, at last there is
found for you a house in which you
are worshipped as gods and at whose
altars the innocents are to be sacrificed
for you to make an election holiday.
This procession of blood-tarnished
votaries, beaded now by the newly un
nointed chief of this political hier
archy, the nominee of a republican
convention for president of the United

Will Frame
ISlewlSJote to
MexicoSoon
Washington, Aug. 5. The reply to
General Carranza's note regarding the
proposed joint commission to settle
border difficulties will not be formu
lated until President "Wilson returns
Monday from his week-end cruise
down the Potomac, State department
ofTicials said today there would be no
announcement as to the position of
the United States until that time.
It was indicate.! that while not en
tirely satisfactory, General Carranza's
note is viewed as opening the way for
broadening the scope, of discussions by
the commissioners as is desired by the
president and information has reached
department officials that the note was
intended to rover thai possibility, al
though it does not mention the sug
gestion except by inference. Whether
it will be regarded as sufficient to war
rant proceeding with the negotiations
without further correspondence will be
determined by President Wilson.
The state department hat; renewed
its representations over the imprison
ment in Mexico City of II. A. Dunn, an
.American electrician, charged with
having sold dynamite to Zapata
bandits.
Some coast resort near "Washington
will be selected, it was believed today,
a.s a meeting place for the joint Mexi
can and American commission to set
tle international differences. Acting
Secretary Polk and Mexican Ambassa-
dor Arredondo probably will confer
on this subject soon.
General Carranza's formal an
nouncement of the appointment of
Mexican conferees apparently is con
sidered satisfactory by the state de
partment. The next step is the nam
ing of American commissioners.
Slate department ofTicials hope Gen
eral Carranza's note does not preclude
extension of the field of negotiations to
subjects the United States government
feels should le taken up.

Troops of Ottoman Empire
Strike Heavy Blow at
British in Egypt.
ATTACKS ARE FUTILE
London Announcement De
clares Royal Forces Still
Hold Positions.
London, Aug. .", (12:." p. m.)
British jtosiliotis near I'omain,
hast of Port S;iid. are being at
tacked by 1 1.000 l urks, the War
oil ice announced iodav. Tlie Turks
are attacking along a front of sev
en to ciirht miles, tlie statement
says and have so far been repulsed.
Attack Expected, Claim.
The Turkish attack on the British
positions in Egypt to the east of the
Suez canal comes as no surprise to
those who axe in close touch with the
i operations in that part of the world.
General Sir Archibald Murray, who
commands the British army there, has
long realized that the Turks with the
assistance of the Austrians and Ger
mans might make a serious attempt on
the canal even at tlie hottest period
of the year.
Austrian and German engineers for
many months have been digging for
water which, close to the Mediterra
nean coast, exists in many cases at no
considerable depth under the sand, al
though it mostly is too brackish for
use of European trxps.
The Turks must, therefore, have
made very thorough arrangements for
the storage and transportation of wa
ter, the country being-a pure sand des
ert with small widely scattered oasis
of date palm growing arouud ancient
wells.
At Roman!, where fighting is in
progress, the Turks must bring up
every drop of water from Aughratina,
some 10 miles away.
An ofiicial statement issued by the
Turkish war office on Friday said
Turkish airmen had attacked with ma
chine guns Uriti.sh ytositions about 25
miles east of the Suez canal.
Last of Suez Canal.
Roma.ni, a village near the coast of
the Mediterranean, 22 miles east of
the Suez canal. It is about 10 miles
northwest of Katia. where several en
gagements recently have been fought
between the British and Turks.
Tlie announcement says:
"The following report timed 11:10 p.
m. on Aug. 4, has been received from
the general officer commanding in
chief in Egypt:
" 'Since midnight of Aug. 3-4 Turks,
whose strength is estimated at 14,000
have been attacking our position near
Romani, east of Port Said, on a front
of seven to eight miles.
" 'The position at dusk on Aug. 4,
was that their attacks had made no
impression on our fortified position,
while on the southern flank the fight
ing also was going in our favor and
between 40i an 1 500 prisoners had
been captured there.
" 'Ships of the royal navy rendered
valuable service from the bay of Tina.
"'Fighting still was in progress
when this report was dispatched. The
temperature during the day reached
100 degrees in the shade.' "
DOES NOT BLAME
FORD FOR BREAK
Madame Schwimmer, "oted Pacificist,
Delines IHfferenees Between Her
aud Detroit .Manufacturer.
Chicago, Aug. 5. Rosika Schwim
mer, the Hungarian pacificist, in a
statement published here today, de
fined the differences between herself
and Henry Ford of Detroit.
Mr. Ford and I always had been on
good terms since the break in the
peace party. He was supporting a
theoretical party which believed more
in studying the situation and letting
the belligerents come to terms, while
the party 1 belong to believes in action.
"I have been working constantly for
peace since the war began. We have
been working in Europe; I came to
America to make a report to Mr. Ford
of what we had done. He was the
founder of our party and I thought
that a.s he was not meeting with great
success my report might encourage
him."
Madame Schwimmer blamed the
IVrd secretaries for her recent failure
to obtain an interview with the Detroit
manufacturer.

VOTE OF RAIL MEN
FAVORING STRIKE
VVith .Five-.Sivths of Ballots Counted
Employes Are Said to Stand 99
to 1 for Break.
New York, Aug. 5. When five-sixths
of the ballots cast by the 400,000 em
ployes of 225 railroad systems through
out the country had been counted to
day, it was announced that the men
stood 09 to 1 for a strike. Union offi
cials said the count would be com
pleted Monday.
Washington, Aug. 5.- President Wil
son and other federal officials kept in
close touch today with the threatened
strike of 400,000 railroad employes.
They planned to take no definite ac
tion, however, until after representa
tives of the railroads and workmen
confer early next week.
I!y that time the strike vote will
have been counted. If it is for a walk
out and no agreement can be reached
with the managements of the 225 rail
road systems involved, it is expected
the federal board of mediation and
conciliation will be called on. If every
other method of preventing a break
has been exhausted, it is believed.
President Wilson may make a personal
appeal for a settlement of the differ
ences. DANISH PAPERS
SORE AT TREATY
Action of Government in Arranging
for Sale of Islands to America .Hade
Subject of Attack.
London, Aug. 5. Some of the Dan
ish conservative papers have opened a
violent attack upon the government
over the treaty with the United States
for the sale of the Danish West In
dies, says a Copenhagen dispatch to
the Exchange Telegraph company.
The National Tidende says: "In a
question of such great importance for
the whole nation the government acted
in a manner such as its worst antag
onists woudl not have believed it capa
ble of. Nobody but the Danish govern
ment would have risked such a
course."
On the other hand Tolitiken points
out that Denmark several times at
tempted to utilize the islands but her
efforts were in vain. This paper says
that under the present war conditions,
the islands might become a danger to
Danish neutrality and that, it might be
difficult for Denmark to defend them
from encroachment.

Car Strikes
Tie Up Lines
inlSlewYorh
New York, Aug. 5. Strikes were in
effect today on virtually every surface
car line in the boroughs of Manhattan,
Queens and the Bronx, involving 6,600
conductors and motormen and affect
ing 2,300,000 persons who daily use
these lines. Indications at 7:30 a. m.
were that all the surface car lines in
Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens were
nearly tied up. A few cars, guarded
by policemen, were moved.
The labor leaders asserted that SO
per cent of the employes of the New
York Railways company, which oper
ates the majority of the surface lines
in Manhattan, had voted to strike.
The elevated and subway lines which
were not affected by the strike voted,
were thronged. Preparations were
made by large business institutions to
convey their employes to and from
work in automobiles and omnibuses.
The street railway lines involved in
cluded the New York Railways com
pany, the Second avenue line, Third
avenue railway company and two lines
in the Bronx.
The strike to enforce a demand for
recognition of the union and increased
wages began to take effect on the main
lines of the New York Railways com
pany as early as 10 o'clock last night
when the first meeting of conductors
and motormen voted to quit work. One
thousand men took a similar vote at a
meeting early this morning. Employes
of the Second avenue line, who had
presented no demands to the company,
struck in sympathy. Two hundred em
ployes of the surface lines in Queens
borough voted to quit early today. The
Brooklyn lines are not involved.
At D o'clock this morning officials
of the New York Railways company
said service on all their lines was "al
most normal." This was apparent,
for on only a few lines was any delay
in the operation of cars noticed.
Many workers on the way to their
place of employment were unaware
that a strike was in progress.
As the day wore on it appeared that
the strike was gaining headway. In
spector Schmidtberger reported that
in many cases cars that had started
from the barns in the early morning
were withdrawn before the noon hour.

POSSES HUNTING
DARING ROBBERS
Counties Surrounding iJetroit Being
Scoured for Men Who Escaped
With $33,000 HauL
Detroit, Mich., Aug. 5. Search was
being" vigorously prosecuted early to
day in every county surrounding De
troit for the five automobile bandits
who, armed with rifles and automatic
pistols, yesterday afternoon held up
the motor pay car of the Burroughs
Adding Machine company and made off
with between $33,000 and $34,000 af
ter shooting and slightly wounding
one man.
The robbery, which occurred within
half a block of the Burroughs plant, is
declared to have been the most daring
in the history of Detroit,
Before the occupants of the paycar,
a number of guards in a car following
and the bandits themselves, realized
what was happening, the robbers had
transferred five cash bags into another
machine and were out of sight. Hun
dreds of persons who saw the holdup
thought they were witnessing the
scenario of a photoplay.
Nine automobiles filled with Detroit
policemen and two loaded with deputy
sheriffs in command of Sheriff Oakman
of Wayne county, took up the chase a
short time after the holdup. At latest
reports all were still scouring the
surrounding country.
At noon today the search had been
extended to all points within a hun
dred mile radius of Detroit.
The police declare one of the theo
ries they are working on is that the
daring holdup was an "inside job."
Officers of the company, however,
repudiate any intimation that any of
their employes possibly was involved.
The condition of Rudolph Cooper, a
Burroughs guard, the only person in
jured as a result of the holdup, today
was declared to be improving.
Lansing, Mich., Aug. 5. Four De
troit men are being held here by the
