Sir Roger Casement Hanged
"Wednesday Morning 1
Tower of London.
"Went to Ills Death With For
titude That marked His
Life.
Stood Calmly While Noose "Was

Neck.
PETITIONS FOR CLEMENCY VAIN
The murder of Sir Roger Case
ment, as no other term can be ap
plied to it, is but a culm nation of
the series of murders of Irish states
men, patriots and citizens by the
British Government and is only an
other chapter in the bloody and crim
inal history of the British Empire.
Two years ago the English Govern
ment onered ?5,000 in gold to have
Btr Roger assassinated at Christiana,
Norway, where he .was stopping at
that time, the offer being made in
writing by Findlay, the British
Norwelgan Consul, the plot to mur
der being foiled at that time by
Sir Roger Casement's body servant.
Just one hundred and thirteen years
ago next month Robert Emmet was
meted out the same fate as Case
ment's, and during that long period
brutal England has continued the
same policy, crushing Ireland's
chances for liberty and murdering
Irish -statesmen and patriots who
sprung from the Green Isle and who
sacrificed their lives fighting for
her liberty.
Sir Roger Casement, Irish Knight,
was executed at 9 o'clock Thursday
morning for high treason. Almost
up to the hour he was led forth
from the historic Tower of London,
where he had been confined to the
death chamber, efforts were made
by his friends to obtain a reprieve.
The Government, however, was firm
in its decision to carry out the de
cree of the courts and exacted the
death penalty. Sir Roger went to
his death with the same fortitude
that marked his life and stood
calmly while the hangman's noose
was adjusted about his neck. Early
in the morning two priests of the
Roman Catholic church adlminis
tered the last rites in the cell of
the condemned man and shortly
afterward a little procession headed
by the clergymen with Casement
following, a warder on either side,
proceeded toward the execution
shed, only five yards away. The
priests recited the litany of the
dying, Casement, responding in low
tones: "Lord, have mercy on my
soul." Casement mounted the gal
lows steps firmly and commended
his spirit to God as ho stepped on
the trap.
Immediately after the trap was
sprung the prison engineer and phy
sician descended into the pit where,
after the application of the usual
test, Casement was pronounced dead
at nine minutes after 9. According
to the custom in the case of pris
oners hanged for crimes similar to
that of Casement, his body will be
burled in quick lime in the prison
yard, but probably no decision as to
the burial will be made until after
the Inquest.
An affecting incident took place
outside the prison wall as the exe
cution was in progress. At the back
of the prison, a little distance from
the jeering crowd about the gates,
was a group of about thirty Irish
men and women. When the dull
clang of the prison bell announced
that the doomed man had paid the
last penalty this little group fell on
their knees and with bowed heads
remained for some moments silently
praying for the repose of the soul
of their dead fellow-countryman.
Immediately after the execution
three notices were posted on the
prison door. The first, signed by
the Under Sheriff of London, the
Governor of the prison and Father
James McCarrell, Casement's con
fessor, read: "Judgment of death
was this day executed on Roger
David Casement in His Majesty's
prison at Pentonvllle in our pres
ence." All the members of Casement's
family were Protestants, and he was
brought up in that faith, but be
came a convert to Roman Catholic
Ism within the last few weeks. On
June 29 he was registered as a
member of the Roman Catholic
church, and since that time Fathers
McCarrell and Carey, of Eden
Grove church, near the prison, have
been ministering to him, He re
ceived his first and only communion
at 7 o'clock Thursday morning,
when he assisted at mass, in the.
cell. One of his attendants said
that his overpowering love for God
and Ireland was most striking. Ac
cording to this attendant, the last
words of the condemned man, apart
6.
from his prayers, were: "ildle for
my country." Father McCarrell said
that he found Casement, to be a
beautiful character, and .that he
never instructed anjione in his re
ligion who showed himself a quicker
or more promising learner.
In England the Manchester
Guardian and a number of other pa
pers pleaded for mercy and peti
tions asking for a reprieve were cir
culated in London. Adherents of
John Redmond forwarded to Pre-
mlpr Asnillth a nntltlnn nlimorl Sv
six nishops, twenty-six members of !
Parliament and fifty-two other per
sons, including a number of edu
cators. Pope Benedict Interceded in
Casement's behalf, endeavoring to
obtain grace for him from the
Dritlsh Government, influential Irish
Nationalists having urged upon the
Pontiff that the prisoner was not a
traitor but was inspired by Irish
patriotism.
KNIGHTS AT DAVENPORT.
With Most Rev. John Bonzano,
the Apostolic Delegate as the bon
ded guest, and with a dozen Arch
bishops and Bishops among those In
attendance, the Supreme Council of
the Knights of Columbus convened
in Davenport on Tuesday for the
thirty-fourth annual session. A
programme that possessed many at
tractive features had been arranged
for the occasion, and the event
brought together delegates and
thousands of visitors from every
State in the Union, from Canada,
Cuba, Mexico and the Philippines.
The fourth degree was exempli
fied for a class of over 250 candi
dates on Monday and the convention
opened on the following day with a
solemn Pontifical mass at Sacred
Heart Cathedral, Archbishop Bon
zano being the celebrant. The ser
mon was preached by Most Rev.
James J. Keano, Archbishop of
Dubuque. When the Supreme
Council went into session at the
Columbia Theater addresses were
delivered by Gov. Clarke of Iowa,
State and local officials of the
Knights of Columbus, and by repre
sentatives of the civic organizations.
One of the most interesting feat
ures of the programme and doubt
less one of the most enlightening
and impressive functions at the con
vention was the public mass meet
ing for non-Catholics and the pub
lic generally at the Coliseum on
Wednesday evening, when Joseph
Scott, of Los Angeles, the eloquent
champion of Catholicism, delivered
a stirring address on "Catholic Citi
zenship." The convention re-elected the four
members of the Board of Directors
whose terms expired. They are
John H. Rcddin, of Denwr; W. D.
Wier, of St. Paul: Dr. N. A. Dus-
sault, 0f Quebec, and Judge Paul
Leche, of Donaldsvllie, La. By
unanimous vote the Knights agreed
to prpvide immediately for the es-
tablishmentof a .recreation camp on
the Mexican border for its soldier
members.
Col. P. H. Callahan, of Louisville,
Chairman of the Religious Prejudice
Commission, reported to the con
vention that there was a decrease in
non-Catholic agitation.
Old Point Comfort was chosen as
the place for the 1917 convention.
CHORAL CLUB SUNSET.
This evening the Hotner Smith
will take Mackin Council's Choral
Club and its friends up the river
for a sunset excursion. The stars
of the recent show, "Tin Soldiers,"
will be the guests of the council,
and will help entertain all present.
Music, dancing and high-class
vaudeville will be the programme,
and a large attendance is expected.
Aulyn Kanston will direct tho
vaudeville, in which will appear
Misses Bertha Cohn, Evelyn John
son and Nettye Fenton, assisted by
the "Tin Soldiers." In addition to
the above the Committee of Ar
rangements have secured Misses
Eileen and Imelda Klppes to sing
and dance their latest successes.
These last two little ladles are very
talented and have been much in
demand this season. This will be
tho last excursion of the season
for Mackin Council.

TROUBLE
The Socialist Pot Is Boiling: and
No Keller in Sight For
Party.
Defection Made Complete by
Desertion of Another Near
Organ.
Now York State Executive Com
mittee Expels Schenectady
Mayor.
THEY WORK THE SPOILS SYSTEM
Tho Metropolitan Magazine was
formerly a near-organ of the Social
ist party. At -least it devoted much
of its space to their propaganda.
Morris Hlllnult was-one of its con
spicuous contributors, and Art
Young, as a lingering memory, is
still employed as its Washington
cartoonist. For some time of late
it has had a change of heart. It has
become the vehicle for the utter
ance of one who loves the' Socialists
not at all, the famous Col. Roose
velt. And as if to maek the defec
tion all the more complete it pub
lishes in its curent issue an article
from the pen of Schenectady's
Mayor, Dr. Lunn, denouncing in no
uncertain words the "machine" of
the Socialist party. Mayor Lunn,
it may be. said, has been expelled by
this "machine" from the party, to
gether with Dr. Charles P. Steln
metz, the President of the Common
Council of Schenectady, and many
others. The reason for their ex
pulsion, as is pretty generally
known, was because they refused to
obey the "local" of the Socialist
party of Schenectady in the matter
of political appointments.
This local is composed of the dues
paying members of the party in that
particular community, and not of
those who voted the Socialist ticket
in the election. It is in this way
the party throughout the country is
organized, the local being a very
valuable asset for propaganda pur
poses. During Lunn's first term as
Mayor the local declared in its con
stitution that that body could
instruct the officials in those things
"that it may deem wise and proper"
and that the officials must obey this
dictation. Dr. Lunn refused to abide
by this declaration and it was done
away with before his next campaign.
As soon as ho again came into office
a wrangle began over tho appoint
ment to political places of members
of the party. Tha result was that
Lunn and his fellows In office were
expelled from the party by the State
Executive Committee of New York.
"Many a Socialist speaker,"
writes Lunn, "almost foams at the
mouth when he enters upon his
tirade against the Injustices which
he charges direct to the well-oiled
machines operated by Barnes and
Murphy." But tho Socialist "ma
chine," he shows us, is practically
every bit as bad; and the spoils sys
tem is at work there, too. Human
nature is a peculiar proposition. It
refuses to change in certain ways
and decidedly will not do so for the
better through force of materialistic
teaching. Socialism is having a hard
time at the job of changing it in
this way; we have much reason to
despair of its success. The attempts
which it has practically made have
not shown any brilliant future pos
sibilities. Its promise of a mlllenium
is more than doubtful.

FORGETS THE OUTSIDE.
Lloyd-George thinks clearly, sees
clearly and speaks clearly in the
following eloquent passage: "Some
times we criticize the Roman Cath
olic church very severely, but there
is no church that has made a surer
and deeper search into human
nature. The Roman Catholic
church, the greatest religious or
ganization in the world, conducts Its
worship in a common tongue. The
Roman Catholics conduct their wor
ship In a language of worship. Their
church utilizes every means of tak
ing people outside every day inter
ests, and seeks to induce them to
forget what is outside. Thus the
language of cemmerce and every
day occupation is left outside, and
the people are taught the language
of worship. That shows a shrewd,
deep Insight into the human mind."

Not Enthused 0cr the Recep
tion of Ilug-hcs' Speech of
Acceptance.
New York Herald's Unique Can
vass Brings Some Startling
Results.
Axton and Louisville Herald
Fighting: For Control of
Local G. O.P.
REPUBLICANS SUPPORT SHERLEY
To find out how ,fhe Hughes
speech of acceptance was lecelved
throughout the country the New
York Herald instructed its corre
spondents in many . pf the.. large
cities throughout the country to 'in
terview the first ten men they met,
the class of men being interviewed
coming from all walks of life, from
the hack driver and elevator man
to the merchant and capitalist. In
New York City the ten were about
evenly divided betwen Wilson and
Hughes. One of those interviewed
said: "Hughes is 'off In his Mexican
talk; the Republicans left that mud
dle to Wilson." In San Francisco
about seven out of ten declared
themselves as satisfied with the
speech, while in Philadelphia disap
pointment was expressed. In Bos
ton, Bloomington and Denver the
preponderance was against Hughes,
while in St. Paul, Burlington and
New Haven the majority declared
themselves in favor of the Republi
can nominee, but summing the in
terviews as a whole the consensus
of opinion was that the speech of
Hughes did not have the right ring,
and that the Progressives couldn't
see it at all. There is no denying
the fact that Hughes as a candidate
for election Is not near as strong as
when he was the silent candidate
for the nomination, it appearing
that he was better thought of by
the people in the role of a Sphinx
than that of the spouting campaign
orator.
Then, again, the gathering of the
Progressives in Indianapolis Thurs
day boded no good for the prospects
of unity In the Republican ranks,
and if the Bull Moose party doesn't
decide on a full ticket it would not
be surprising to see many of the
leaders of that' party come out in
an endorsement for Wilson. It has
repeatedly been said in these col
umns that if Wilson could
straighten out the tangle In Mexican
affairs in the next month or so and
read the riot act to England hiB
re-election would be assured. From
present Indications both may come
to pass, as Whiskers Carranza is
not so keen for a fight Just now,
with fair chances of his elimination
altogether, while tho opportunity
grows daily for a chanco to clve a
stinging rebuke to John Bull.
There has been no let-up In tho
robbery or our mails: the Enellsh
theater audiences are hooting and
Jeering Wilson's name; the British
warships hovering at our gates were
not thought of so kindly, and last
but not least the murder if Sir
Roger Casement, despite the plea of
our President, Senators. Congress
men ahd others, all of these giving
Wilson the opportunity of his life,
and this step would bring him in a
hurry the support of the entire
American people.
The Republican primary here to
day for tho nominations for Con
gress, Prosecuting Attorney, State
Senator and Councilman promises to
leave some bitter after effects, and
Dr. Ryans and his associates of the
old-line Republican faction will cer
tainly have a crow to pick with the
Herald and its Bull Moose follow
ers because of the metheds used to
injure Dr. Ryans' candidacy, he be
ing the real choice of the Republi
can party, while Owens is tho Bull
Moose favorite. It is amusing to
observe the high sounding pratings
of the Herald In regard to machine
politics, etc., while Messrs. Chilton
and Searcy, of the Owens faction,
have done everything possible to
prevent uyans getting an ere;
break with election officers, etc. A;
stated before, tho real issue at stako
is tho control of the Republican
party hero next year, and Wood
Axton, the Bull Moose leader. Is not
fighting half as much for Owens as
he is ror Axton. Following his
lead are the ex-Democrats and
political pirates, with tho Junior
Order boys beating tho tomtoms
and brushing up their little red
badges for tho polls next year.
Scenting another grab nt Axton's
barrel, tho Herald is paving the way
for a billingsgate campaign in
which it delights to picture Demo
crats behind tho bars, etc., tho mat
ter used being about as near to the
truth as the Herald's "War Day
by Day," which slyly attacks and
predicts the fall of Germany every
day.
Many Democrats are prone to ac
cept the suggestion made by Mayor
Buschemeyer the other day in which
he thought it advisable for the
party members not to discuss or
plan for next year's races just now,
but nil pitch In and roll un annMmr
iuuuru oreaKing majority for Con
gressman Sherley and the Demo
cratic ticket. It goes without say
ing that this is easily possible, as
Mr. Sherley will receive the inde
pendent vote in a bulk, and tho
writer ventures to say that 90 per
cent, of tho Hughes-Fairbanks
workers organized the other day
will scratch their ticket to vote for
his election. This committee Is
cumposeu ot uio nower of the Re
publican party, especially from the
standpoint of wealth and prestige,
but It Is especially noticeable that
they are not interested in the Re
publican Congressional primary to
day. Many voters are discussing tho
selection of two members of the
Board of Education this fall and the
impression is gaining ground that
the people should be allowed to
make a choice themselves and that
mo voters siiould select their choice
or choices In' the same manner as
they select the Board of Aldermen,
voted for from the city at large.
Ben W. Kllng, who made such a
remarkable race two years ago, is
again in the field, canvassing among
the voters of all parties, and it is
believed that he will be elected in
November. Nothing is being said
against the personal qualifications
of the two members of the present
board who are candidates, but it is
a protest against the method of
selection.
SLIDE THEM FEKL GOOD.
Division 1, A. O. H held its reg
ular monthly meeting on Thursday
of last week, and despite the ex
treme heat many members attended
who had been absent from previous
meetings, as well as tho old guard,
who never miss one. President
Mark Ryan was unavoidably absent,
and Vice President William L.
Cushlng occupied the chair, con
ducting the meeting and expediting
the business in a very laudable man
ner. The presence of James P.
Barry added zest to the proceedings,
and in his usual manner ho spoke
with zeal and earnestness for tho
good and future welfare of Division
1. He was clad to see so mnnv
present and to know that tho divis
ion now, as ever, was able to meet
her financial obligations. Financial
Secretary Clancy was kept busy tak
ing dues from members, while
Treasurer Thomas Keenan kept tab
on the dollars and announced with
glee that he had just received more
money from dues at this meeting
than would pay all claims against
tho division. This put all members
present in good cheer as was per
ceptible by the remarks of tho va
rious speakers. The Recording
Secretary, Daniel McCarthy, was In
structed to send out notices to all
members to attend tho next meet
ing and learn the good advancement
made by the order and Its achieve
ments since the first of the year.
The Visiting Committee reported no
member on the sick list at present,
and this gave more Joy to the mem
bers present, as manifested ere the
meeting adjourned.

'
Seems Prospect of an Amlcahle
Settlement of tho Irish
Problem.
John Dillion Calls Upon the
Government to Disclose
Its Plnn.
Joe Devlin Denounces Premier's
Method of Shifting Re
sponsibility. POSITION OF NATIONALIST PARTY
The debate In the House ot
Commons Monday on John Dillon's
mot on urging the Government to
disc ose its plan for the government
pf Ireland during the war, seems
to have left tho i.... .
amicable settlement of tho Irish
problem as distant as before.
l remler Asquith made a conciliatory
speech, but ho had little to an
nounce tending to appease National
1st susceptibility, for although ho
expressed tho conviction that a per
manent settlement would be reached
sooner than many persons imag
ined, John Redmond, the Nation
alist leader, made it clear that' hla
party was dissatisfied and would
henceforth consider it self-absolved
from association with the coalition
Government and free to criticize
and oppose It Independently in any
circumstances. The main ground
for his objection to the Govern
ment's plan for an interim govern
ment was that it would be in the
hands of the new Secretary for
Ireland. Henry Edward Duke, and
the Attorney General, Sir Frederick
E. Smith, both Unionists; that in
fact it was a revival of Castle gov
ernment. John Redmond. In thn rnnnu nf
his speech, made much of tho
agreement between Sir Edward
Carson and himself. He said ho
did 'not think It worth Sir Edward
Carson's while to seek to vary tho
torms of the agreement. Redmond
added that the position of the Na
tionalist party was that In the midst
of a great war It was impossiblo
seriously to consider a permanent
settlement of these questions. Thoy
had agreed to every word of tho
written contract which was ac
cepted by their followers as a tem
porary measure. He had .objected
to tho formation of a coalition Gov
ernment at the first, but what thoy
now were getting was a pure
Lnlonlst Government in Ireland. Ho
did not care how able or broa'd
mlnded such a Government might
be, ho objected to it altoeether. Tt
would cause tho most profound dis
satisfaction In Ireland, and instead
of allaying tho present unrest would
tend in tho opposite direction. Tho
Government, he contended, ought
Instantly to withdraw the proclama
tion of martial law. Ho assured
tho House that throughout the un
happy circumstances of this con
troversy he had not been able for
a moment to forget the war. Noth
ing had happened, or could happen,
to alter his views about that. Ho
repeated that the very highest in
terests of Ireland consisted in that
country doing her duty, and slio
was doing it now.
The leading features of Premier
Asquith'a speech wero the an
nouncement of the new Secretary
for Ireland; his sidetracking of the
so-called Plunkett scheme for an
advisory council, which had been,
strongly supported outside of tho
House, but which tho Premier de
clared was impracticable, and tho
announcement that there would bo
no reduction Of tho military fnrooa
in Treland. Ho also indicated that
all the Unionist members of tho
Cabinet were in practical agreement
with Lord Lansdowne. This was
further confirmed by Andrew Bonar
Law, Secretary for tho Colonies,
who admitted that Lord Lansdowne
and himself had arrived at the same
point by different paths.
Joseph Devlin, who followed,
said ho hoped that the next time
he marched with the Nationalists
through the division lobby, it
would be for the purpose of turn
ing out the coalition Government.
He warned tho Government not to
kill the constitutional movement
for home rule, and charged the
Premier, with cowardice in turning
over to Lloyd-George the attempt
to reach a settlement. It was an
other example of tho Premier's
method of shifting responsibility,
Mr. uevnn saia ne could never
agree to a reduction of representa
tion in Westminster until a perma
nent settlement was reached. He
had never heard "& more idiotic"
proposal than the one put forward
'Sir Edward Carson that what Brit
ish statesmen failed to settle Irish
men might settle for themselves.
SEVERE ON CHURCH.
The Catholic church in England
has been dealt a severe blow In the
Government's dictation that the
seminarians who are eighteen years
of age and who have not com
menced tho study of theology are
subject to military duty. The ruling
is such as to catch all aspirants to
the priesthood except a few who
aro already in the last stages of
tneir preparation ror God's service.
This will mean that. If the war con
tinues for a protracted period, the
seminaries, when those now therein
are ordained; must oioee, while
eventually there will come a period
of years when there will be no one
ready for ordination.
