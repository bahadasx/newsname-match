You hope that in the future you will have more leisure
and more property than you have now.
That is a worthy ambition. The only way to realize it
is to reserve a part of your earnings and turn them into
capital. They become so even while drawing interest, and
they are at hand when a way for more productive invest
ment opens.
Begin making that capital now.

can not sar much for your streets.'7
There are a great many things to at

YEARS ADDED TO YOUR LIFE
Many people say they wish they could
live their lives over again. Thi3 13 im
possible, but many people could add
i years to their lives if thev cared to do
so. Did you ever stop to think that
the slight kidney, stomach or heart
trouble which scarcely bothers JXa at
all may in tha end shorten your life
many years? It is easy tp pull up the

it would be a real task. So it i3 with
disease, the time to sret rid of it is
! while it is younc. Little troubles neir-
lected mean grave troubles later on. If
you feel that you are developing a
weakness in some bodily organ, consult
a specialist. A little treatment now
maybe all you need, later your case
may be hopeless.

afternoon erecting the "Keep to the

cil at the last meeting. The lettering

did not -see the sign.

arrests if the new rule is not complied

Fl2ys State Fair Icr Treatment ol
Papers.
The action of the State Fair Board
in leading Up tho ne wspapers of the
state the past year with "free. boiler
plate advertising" and then spending
$4,900 in gcod hard cash with the bill
board men, is a sample of the manner
m which newspapers are often treated
by the public. They are largely consid
ered as a public institution to be used
free of charge when needed and to be
given no consideration when a little
money for pnblicity is to be expended.
The attitude of the old board in regard
to the newspaper advertising has
stirred up a big howl among the news
paper editors of the stats.
In previous years as much as $5,000
was spent by the state board k-gitimate
newspaper advertising. This year the
board cut out the paid advertising and
flooded the newspapers of the state
with "free dope," which many papers j
used out of the "goodness of their'
hearts." In return for this considera
tion on the part of the paprrs the fair
board went ahead and pent 4,000 of
good money for bill board advertising.
It was thi3 that caused the howl and it
is doubtful if the State Fair will get a
line of free advertising next year unless f
it mends its way. Gazette, Xenia, O. j
