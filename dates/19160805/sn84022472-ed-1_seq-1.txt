Carelessness, born of an un
i founded sense of security, has
J combined with , the hot weather
I to cause the great flare in the

observed in the last few days
saysiDr. Abraham Sophian. y-
'"Bridgeport -had its sixth
death of infantile paralysis- to

have been discovered in ' the
last few davs than in anv aim
ilar period since first week
"Because there -was a lull In the
excitement,' declared Dr. Sophian,. -to-
, day, "people, began to get too conn
dent. This led to relaxation of the
safeguards with a consequent f In
crease In the number of cases.
"Tha,t is my belief, as a result -of a
study I made of the -situation yester
day that a false sense ot security and
the, hot weather haVe caused the in-

ef new cases f romday , to day is likely
to fluctuate. . De. Sophian announced
. av series of new precautions 'designed
' to aid in preventing the spread ot the
contagion. - , (
For the next month, he said, -no cir.
cus. fair or carnival will be allowed

WEATHER FORECAST
Partly ckmdy tonight and Sunday.
JUght, west winds.
New Tork,- Aug. 6 Although
strikes were in effect today on nearly
every surface car line iri Manhattan,
Queens and the, Bronx, many persons
were unaware that between 2,000 and
2,600 of the 6,600 motormen and con
ductors Involved had quit.
With professional strike-breakers
and loyal employes in the places of
strikers, officials of the New Tork
Railways Co. and the New Tork &
Queens County Railways said at 10
a m. that almost normal schedules
were being maintained on their lines.
At the request of company officials,
Police Commissioner Woods assigned
a policeman to every car affected by
the strike and, with the exception of
a few minor demonstrations, there
was no disorder.
Claims of the union and the com
panies conflicted; the companies as
serting that less than 600 men had
struck, while labor leaders declared
the strike effected 80 per cent, of the
6,600 employes.
The cars were late in getting away
from their respective barns, which led
to the belief during the early hours
of the day that a serious tie-up had
been effected by the strike.
Reports received by Police In
spector Max Schmittberger during the
early forenoon showed that 698 of the
1,291 cars operated normally by the
New Tork Railways Co. were in ser
vice, that the Third Avenue lines in
the Bronx were operating 109 'cars
out of 262, but in Manhattan only 73
out of 605. In Queens, the reports
said that 33 cars out of 171 were in
operation. .-, ' ' '
About 60 cases of intimidation and
other disorderly acts were reported to
police headquarters, Including a dem
onstration at one, of the New York
Railway car barns which police re.
serves were called.,, There were few
arrests. ' ,

More than 1,600 men are needed to

recruiting officers find, -however, that
men in the Connecticut cities . and
towns are all employed and all well
paid for their work. The prospect of
indefinite service along the bolder for
solalers pay aoes not appeal to mem.
First-Lieut Arthur L. LaRocque, in
charge of the recruiting work in this
City, has four prospects in tow. These
men have been sent to be examined by
Major Frederic J. Adams, but they
have not reported back to the
lieutenant. No ; more recruits for
