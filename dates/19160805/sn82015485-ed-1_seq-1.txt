DOPE THE FLY
Manhattan, Kansas, July 24, 1916:
A fly repellent used on diary cows is
a relief for a short time. Also the
fly traps and clean methods in hand
ling and feeding cows help to keep
the number of flies small, believes
J. B. Fitch, associate professor of
dairy husbandry tn the Kansas State
Agricultural college.
'There are many repellents- that
can be made cheaply. says Mr. Fitch.
"The. one reccomended. by the collage
consists of two cakes of laundry soap
dissolved- in warm water, I 1-2 pounds
of resin, soap, and fish oil, until the
resin desolves. -"Add
half a pint of kerosene oil to
the mixture when it is ready to use.
Apply it with a brush or spray pump.
About half a pint should be used on
the cow at an application. It will be
necessary to make the application
three times a week until the hair
has become coated with the resin.
"Another receipt recomended by
Minnesota Experiment station com
prises one pound of rancid lard and
half pint of kerosene oil mixed
thoroughly until a creamy mass forms.
Kub this not too thickly over the
backs of the cows with a cloth or
with the bare hand."

EXPLANATION IN WHAT MAKES
MYSTERY CLOCK CO
Since the patriot hung in its win
dow fThe Clock of Mystery" with its
I nothing to deceive you dial, hundreds
of inquirers have asked what the
clock itself asks. "What makes.it
go." Scoies. of persons have entered
our drugstore and volunteered infor
mation. Some said gravity; others
the earth's magnetisn and some de
clared that at last perpetual motion
bad been attained.
With similar clocks elsewhere the
thetown is humming with possible
explamations for the big time piece.
The beholder sees an octagonal shap
ed piece of clear glass, suspended
from above by brass chains. Around
the rim of the octagon are the figures
of a clock's face and at the center the
two hands join on a pivot. Hanging
to one of the hands is a small com
pass, the size of a "nickel." And
there you -are.--" The clock keeps per-fecLticnei.---.
, .
."-".What makes it go?" ' The "revot
ution of the" earth on its axis every
twenty four hours possesses both a
rotary and a centrifugal force. The
rotary force is neutralized so we do
not notice it by the tremenduous
size or the earth's sphere, and the
centrifugal force is neutralized by
the magnetic attractions which
causes articles to fall instead of fiv
out into space when dropped.
By supplanting this neutralization
of the rotary motion of the earth in
its daily revolution by a counter bal
ancing influence secured by means of
a bisecting spheroid to which a mag
netic compass is attached, and by as
tronomically calculating the proper
reduction in size so that the circum
ference of the clock's dial bears the
same relationship to its axis as the
circumference of the earth, and also
utilizing the attractions of the moon
to the earth, which is found to be
felt upon the hour hand of the clock
when this neutralization is removed
by the above mentioned scientific
discovery, then the hands are. allowed
to rotate in accord with the revol
ution of the earth the same as the
earth rotates on its axis, except that
the calculation is such that the
hands of the clock make two revol
utions to the earth's " one. The
clock can seen at W. W. Gibson's
drugstore and is worth seeing.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
We all' believe in public lib.axies.
We frequently discuss the library we
are to get "bye and bye," we do not
find that it is helping the boys and
girls who are growing up in our town
now. Will the next generation need
it more than this? Will the children
of the next generation be dearer to
us than the boys and girls who now
cheer our firesides? Will they use a
library better because their parents
have not had such privileges? We
all want a library for ourselves, for
our neighbors, for tiie good name of
our town.. Why not get it now and
be getting the good out of it. It is
only a question of method. The
library whe l built should benefit all
the people. Give us all a chance to
help and then the library will belong
to all of us. "

MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards, Aug. 1st.
1916. The pasture cattlemen have
plenty of resistance left not-Fup
withstanding the continued lack- of
moistuTe. and the lower prices of
yesterday caused many car orders to
be canceled. Receipts today are 1300
head, considerable short of liidlca-Ewllo.
lions yesterday. The market aver
ages steady today, exceptions strong
on cows, medium grass steers slow.
Grazers are going to wait until the
feeder buyer gets ready to buy, un
less the situation strengthens with
out that influence, before they turn
cattle on the market freely.
Beef Steers A number of droves
of good corn and grass cattle from
Missouri sold at $9.70 to $9.90, other
fed steers down to 38.25. Offerings
from Kansas pastures were only a
medium grada, selling at 97.00 to
$7 50. Feeder buyer bought steers
yesterday at ;$7.85 mates of steers
that sold killers at another market at
$7 55 indicating that the feeder trade
is already helping -the grass beef
market. Best Kansas, wintered steers
would sell around tS 50. ..Texas;cattle
graced in Kansas and 'Oklahoma' selii
at $6.50 to $7.10 this week, and some
cheap steers bought here last winter
around $5.50 are coming back from
Oakiaboma this week and selling at
$6.50 to $6.80. Quarantine arrivals
of 40 cars contained . good Texas fed
steers at $7.50 10 $3.50, Oklahoma
grass steers at $5 75 to $7.25. Butcher

feeders to $6 70, stockers $6 40, some
plain cattle under these prices. Stock
cows and heifers bring $5.00 to $6 50.
Hogs Hog prices are not yet on a
plane satisfactory to .killers, and
most sales are lower today, top $9.65,
bulk of sales $9.40 to $9.60, receipts
1500 head. Order buyers are a promi
nent' factor and they are able to pick
the offerings over before packer buy
ers start, packers realizing that any
show of strong competition from
them wduld boost prices immediately.
Ttie hog market is in a peculiar posi
tion, with conditions entirely in
favor of growers. .
Sheep and Lambs The market is
showing some weakness today, after
