Village After Bitter Fight.

Raid.
LONDON, August 5. ? The .
main German second line system
on a front of 2,000 yards north ot
I'ozieres, on the Somme front,has
been captured by the British, it ,
was officially announced by the
war office this afternon.
A bombardment of the most
violent character is taking place
over the entire sector of Thiaumont
and Fleury. The battle
lasted from 9 o'clock last night
until this morning, the Germans
making unsuccessful efforts, the
statement adds, to drive the
French from Thiaumont work,
which was gained, lost and mostly
regained yesterday.
The fighting at Fleury has been
fierce. After having evacuated
the whole of the village yesterday
morning, as a consequence of several
German attacks, French ini
fantry, in the afternoon, carried
with the bayonet the greater part 1
of the village. The situation here '
is without appreciable change. J
Success at Thiaumont.
The success at Thiaumont is looked ]
upon as more important as evidence ]
of the energy of the French infantry
than as a military achievement. The ?
work is so swept by the artillery of
either side as to be of little use to the
possessors.
French officers point to the fact that
the efforts of the Germans are now
restricted to the Fleury-Thiaumont j
section as an evidence of the growing
\ ukuess of the invader's forces in
the Meuse region.
I'm: French are back within a mile
o. Fort Douaumont. where the most
tenlflc fighting of the German offensive
took place.
Fighting in Sommc Region.
The correspondent of La Liberie of
Paris in northern France sends the following
account of the fight in the region
of the Somme;
"While furious cannonading is going on
night and day, destroying the adversary's
entrenchments, the Germans are trying
desperately to take the French positions j
in Delvilie wood and at the Monacu farm.
Repeated attacks, however, have been in
vain and prisoners confirm the extent of
the German losses.
"The 14th Bavarian regiment, which
was seriously affected at Bethincourt was
re-formed and hastily sent to the Somme
front on July 10. One of its battalions
was wiped out, while the second and third j
battalions lost 50 per cent of their
strength. A major and seven officers of
the third battalion were taken prisoners.
Battalion Ceases to Exist.
"The 111th Regiment also sustained
heavy losses, which are admitted in a
service note found on a prisoner. The
note ended with these words. 'From this j
day. July 31, the second battalion ceases j
to exist. The men belonging thereto are !
ordered to join the first battalion.' One j
of the French machine gun companies j
was concentrating a flanking fire on the
Germans debouching from the Ma u re pas j
and inflicted heavy losses on them. All j
day yesterday the Germans bombarded J
violently our work there and the adjoining j
section, but French batteries replied ener- ;
getically, and reduced a number of the !
enemy guns to silence.
"The efforts of the Brandenburgians ;
to retase the Delville woo^ were futile i
in face of the courageous resistance of
the .-south African troops. At one point
tne British allowed the Brandenburgians
to corne within less than fifty
meters of the British positions. There |
they were met by the simultaneous Are
of machine guns, and only a few es- ,
caped the massacre.
"The news of the retaking yesterday
of Fleury was received on the ijonirie
front with much enthusiasm, officers
and men sang the "Marseillaise/ their
voices resounding as far as the adversaries'
trenches. At C the soldiers
hastily constructed with leaves a triumphal
arch, placing on it the inscrlp- j
lion, 'We will get them.' "
uriusn Aeroplane Eaid.
British naval aeroplanes on Wednes- j
day carried out a successful raid on a ;
German aerodrome and on ammunition j
sheds in towns south of Ghent, Belgium.
says an official announcement i
given out tonight by the admiralty.
The statement says:
"On Wednesday successful attacks by
a naval aeroplane squadron of bombing
and fighting machines were carried out
on an enemy aerodrome at St. Denis, on
Westrem, and on his ammunition slreds
at Meirelbeke. About two tons of bombs
were dropped and considerable damage
was done.
"One of our fighting machines, with
Flight Lieut. Baudry. is missing, and is
\ believed to have been shot dowxw -Tb*
a J
remaining machines returned undamaged."
Latest French Communication.
The text of the latest French statement
follows:
"The night passed in relative quiet on
the Semme front. Between the Rivers
Avre and Aisne we dispersed several
patrols of the enemy and took a number
of prisoners.
"On the right bank of the Meuse the
cannonading last night was violent on
the entire sector between Thiaumont
and Fleury. The Germans endeavored
by furious counter attacks to drive us
from tlie work of Thiaumont, which we
hold firmly.
"This fighting lasted from 9 o'clock last
night to this morning. It .resulted in
neavy losses to the enemy, and each one
of their endeavors was repulsed without
their being able to obtain the slightest
advantage.
"The fighting continued with equal
spirit in the village of Fleury. but it
resulted in no appreciable change in
the situation.
"There has been intermittent artillery
fighting in other sectors.
"On the right bank of the river, to
the east of Pont-a-Mousson, after a
preparatory artillery fire, the Germans
delivered upon our positions in the
Facq forest an attack which resulted
in failure under the fire of our machine
gu ns.
"On the Somme front French scouting
aeroplanes delivered seventeen attacks
upon the enemy, during the course of
which two German machines were seriously
damaged and compelled to land
precipitately within their lines. Two
other German aeroplanes were brought
down in the region of Verdun. One
fell near Abaucourt and the other not
far from Moranville."
British Official Report.
The text of today's British official
statement says:
"North of Pozieres a local attack last
night in which Australians and troops
of the new army took part was completely
successful. The German main
second line system on a front of more
than 2,000 yards was captured, several
hundred prisoners remaining in our
hands.
"Repeated counter attacks subsequently
delivered against the position
captured were repulsed with very
heavy loss to the enemy.
"Excent for some mininer activity
near Souchez and Loos there was no
incident of importance on the remainder
of the British front."
BARSWBEER"
AFTER AUGUST 15
/
Cannot Be Sold in District
Without a Liquor
License.
Sale cf "near beer" in the District
without a liquor license is to be prohibited
after August 15.
Announcement to this effect was made
oday, following a conference between
Commissioner Newman, Maj. Pullman,
superintendent of police, and Francis
H. Stephens, assistant corporation
counsel.
More than one hundred establishments,
it is believed, will be affected
by the order. Hotels also will be
barred from serving the beverage on
Sundays.
Based on Court Decision.
The Commissioners' action is based
on a recent decision handed down in
i'olice Court sustaining a prosecution
tor the sale of 'near beer" without a
District license. It was held that the
possession by the defendant of an internal
revenue license was prima facie
> . lucncv t>i me sale Oi intoxicating
liquors.
ao appeal was taken from this decision,
but it is expected that prosecutions
to be entered alter August 10, if
sale of the beverage in alleged violation
of law is discovered by the police,
will result in a test case being made.
Official Statement Issued
In explanation of their decision the
Commissioners, this afternoon, gave out
the following statement: Acting under
the verdict of the Police Court in the
case of the District of Columbia versus
Lyons, the Commissioners have directed
the major and superintendent of police
and corporation counsel to arrest and
pprosecute all persons selling near-beer
under the conditions found in the Lyons'
case.
"in order that no injustice be done
it directed that arrests and prosecutions
be made beginning Augus' 15th.
under the conditions found in the Lyons
in the Lyons' case arose from the verdict
of the jury based, upon certain instructions
to the jury given by the
court. This verdict was affirmed by the
court and no appeal was taken therefrom,
so that it now stands as law in
th?- District of Columbia.
"The conditions under which near
beer was sold in the Lyons case arid
und?-r which arrest and prosecution of
others will follow on August 15 are
set forth in the following extract from
the court's instruction to the jury:
Court's Instructions Quoted.
" This law provides that any one
selling liquor, distilled or malt liquors,
without a license must be prosecuted,
and, if convicted, must be punished. In
determining the case of an unlicensed
piace. you are at liberty to take into
consideration the possession of the
usual contents that go to'make up an
unlicensed place?that is, whisky, gin
*>r anything <>f that kind.
" 'If they have it io their possession,
and. you think they have it for sale,
whether they sell it or not, they are guilty
of the offense of selling, under this law.
" 'Then, the law also determines that
if a license, an internal revenue license,
IS! i r i f it I tn win u ? tV.?- \.v .1?
defendant, and on his premises, you are
at liberty to take that license, aside from
an\ thing else, as indicating that he has
the stuff there for sale ; that is, intoxi<
axing liquors, because the law, in the
paragraph relating to this special tax reeelpt,
under the internal revenue law,
says that if he has distilled or malt
liquors on his premises and sells it there,
under the license, the internal revenue
license, that is prima facie evidence of a
sale, not of malt liquors or of distilled
liquors, but of intoxicating liquors, as
t h?* law determines plainly in the paragraph
referred to.
" *lf he has distilled or malt liquor in
his possession, and he sells it there on
those premises, at that particular place,
and you believe that, it is prima faci*
evidence of a sale of intoxicating
liquors, and this law does reach this
near-beer in that way, because it shifts
the burden from the government in
establishing the intoxicating feature ol
it, because if he sells malt liquors the
law says it is a sale of intoxicating
liquors, and It is incumbent then upon
the defendant to show that it was a
liquor not of an intoxicating character
It is admitted here that he sella nearbeer,
whatever that is. He justifies
under this license the selling of mall
liquors. If you believe that, he it
guilty of this offense of selling intoxicating
liquors.'" . .

PROGRESSIVES RETURNING
TO THE REPUBLICAN FOLD
Split in Senatorial Election Predict
ed With Taggart and New as the
Successful Candidates.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
INDIAinAPOLIS, August 5.?
As frankly admitted by fair-minded
leaders in all parties, Indiana
promises to be one of the closes!
states of the Union in the coming
national and state elections. Botl
republicans and democrats being
encouraged to entertain honest
hope of victory by the condition:
as they respectively view them
neither party dares absolutely tc
claim victor)- as certain.
The Hoosier state will vote for twc
United States senators, will have tw<
native sons candidates for Vice President
and one candidate for President?
ttaniey, prohibitionist?and will vot<
for governor, full state and count]
tickets and representatives in Con
gress.
In this state the progressives wil
have full tickets in the field, national
senatorial* congressional and state. Ir
75 of the 92 counties they will hav?
county tickets, and in 113 of the 12(
legislative districts have legislative
tickets.
Indiana Vote in Other Years.
There are 3,500 precincts in the
state, and the change of one vote in a
precinct will make a change of 7,000 ir
the result. That this might be effective
is shown by past experience. Ir
1S72 the state went democratic by
1.000; in 1876 democratic by 5,000; ir
1880 republican by 6,000; in 18S4 democratic
by 6,000; in 1888 republican b>
2,300; in 1892 democratic by 7,000; ir
1908 republican by 10,000.
Indiana, therefore, has always beer
fighting ground, and in this year oi
grace 1916 there promises to be one oi
the most hotly contested campaigns
the much harried Hoosiers have ever
engaged in. It will be a fight where
the contending parties will get down
to individuals, pulling and hauling at
the very doorstep and counting noses
in every domicile. It
is a trite saying, hut none the less
true, that Indianians take to politics as
a duck to water. It is a fact that the
state has for years produced crops oi
the most skillful politicians the country
raises, and political campaigning
is reduced to a science on the banks
of the Wabash and contiguous territory.
Both Parties Well Managed.
Both parties are well matched this
year in respect to the ability of their
leadership and management. Among
the republicans the old guard war
horses are again in the field, and th<
democrats have among their managers
men with stakes in the game who havf
been noted for years as political experts.
This is especially true of the senatorial
and gubernatorial tickets. Foi
the senatorship Thomas Taggart. democrat,
whose name is a household wore
in every hamlet, is running for th?
short term against Jim Watson, republican,
old guard manager of manj
past campaigns. For the long terrr
Harry S. New, raised in politics bj
: his father, the late John C. New, re
J T ublican veteran, is contesting wit!
Senator John W. Kern, democrat.
There is a ouartet for you when ii
! comes to practical politics. If ther<
I are any moves in the game mat tney
I don't know Indiana would be immense
!y gratified to have them stated.
Split Likely on Senatorship.
| Now, on the senatorship. the best poi
litical report out here is that irrespecj
live of what may be the result on th<
presidency and the governorship, then
i may be a split decision. Without ofj
fering invidious suggestions, it may b?
; reported as part of the current talfc
! that Taggart and New are considerec
j as likely to run ahead in fhe election
j To state it delicately, it is said thai
| Taggart and New are stronger will
the populace than Kern and Watson.
There is no suggestion of any dea
or trade to this end, but the possibility
is explained on the ground of the personal
hold which these two candidate:
have upon the voters, somewhat regardless
of political divisions.
It fs said to be almost a certainty
that Mr. Taggart will receive some re
publican votes for the short term which
will be withheld from Mr. Watson, am
by the same token that Mr. New wil
have the support of some democrats
votes for the long term instead of thei:
going to Mr. Kern. Thece is talk t<
this effect in both democratic and re
j publican circles here, and is submittec
| merely, as part of the routine report o:
j politics.
Wilson Strong Throughout State.
As to the national outlook, it is t
fact that the democratic managers hav<
been very much encouraged by report.coming
to them from two very important
classes in Indiana, the farmer.*
: and the laboring men. According to in
1 formation which is at hand, and which
i the republican managers are not very
i confidently denying. noin mose ciasse;
i are pretty well satisfied with the Wil
1 son administration and disinclined t<
1 be interested in propositions to change
In point of fact, the statements an
partially confirmed in some republicar
quarters and causing no little concern
There is not a question of doubt thai
the republicans are aroused, and som<
of them at least to a degree which
leads them to the conviction that th<
state will have to be fought for to b<
won and that the fight will be a hare
one.
With the laboring men it is said U
be the same cry heard elsewhere, "Wilson
kept us out of war," together wit!
I contentment over full employment anc
good wages. With the farmers it ii
' said to be gratification over fine price:
ar.d no fault to be found with the leg
islative record of the administration.
Causes of Republican Concern.
| As to both classes the fundamenta
* cause for the republican concern ii
. said to be the apathy of the voter:
rowiAg^el indifference to politics
<
*
*
\ ^oViR- /
I ;
. founded on their general contentment
i with conditions as they exist. The republicans
complain that they cannot
i get them stirred up.
The German vote, which is extensive,
i is unquestionably being organized
against the administration, but there
- is another side to that shield. It is
i said that among independents especially
the course of the Germans in makt
ing a political issue out of the ad'
ministration's handling of the German
question is being resented ar , is
> bringing support to President \* flson.
The republicans are not worried over
the activity of the progressives, even
to the extent they have gone in naming
full tickets. As a downright fact.
1 the progressives in Indiana while well
organized are not considered numerous.
' The influential and important progres'
sives have come.back to the republican
party, some of them as long ago as a
twelve-month. The progressive leaders
who could sway votes by the thou'
sands are now swaying them to the re5
publican ticket, and it is the smaller
fellows, enthusiastic and earnest
enough, it is true, but without a following,
w'jo are at work now for the
progressir *s.
% In 1912 there were 162,000 progressives
in this state, twelve thousand
more than there were regular repubrt
licans. By 1914 they had dropped to
. 108,000 and the republicans had gone
up to 226,000, the combined vote being
5 60,000 in excess of the democratic vote.
3 Since 1914 they have been coming back
, in large blocks, following their leaders,
and have been royally treated by the
regulars.

i < i
Urges All Progressives to Line !
Up in Support of
Hughes.
CHICAGO, August 5.?Ray- \
mond Robins, chairman of the \ \
progressive national convention i
and candidate of the Illinois pro- i
gressives for United States sen- i
altor in 1914, announced today i
that he would support Charles j
Evans Hughes, republican nom- 1 i
inee for President; declared that 1
it was "manifest" that the pro- '
gressive party was dead, and as- ]
serted that "wise and sincere ]
progressives" should join with ; ]
republicans in the "common W
struggle for social and industrial ji
justice in city, state and nation."
In the statement, which was addressed '
to the progressives of the country, Mr.
Robins said:
Stand at Cross Roads.
"We progressives stand at the cross
roads. American social, industrial and
political life has broken down under
the old individualistic control. A new
national mind and conscience developing
social unity, industrial standardization,
efficient political honesty; from a
self-controlled democracy?this is the
goal of our generation in American
life. I believe in the character and
courage of the nominee of the republican
party. He is the most conspicuous
example in our history of the possibilities
that American politics may
hold for success in able and unselfish
public service. For myself, I gladly
enlist with the great majority of the
progressives of the nation under the
leadership of Charles Evans Hughes.
"The supreme need in American political
life is leadership supported by a
voting rank and file that will organize
and maintain an adequate social, industrial
and military preparedness, together
with a comprehensive foreign policy.
"Can these imperative national needs
be worked out by a states rights democratic
party that plans a state dominated
militia with its menace of shiftless
incompetence, spoils politics and
organized snobbery in a national defense
force at a time of world peril.
"Comprehending our national necessities,
how can progressives hesitate long
to choose between the party of nationalism
and the party of sectionalism? Should
not wise and sincere progressives go en
masse into the republican primaries, and
fighting shoulder to shoulder with progressive
republicans, help and be helped
in our common struggle for social and
industrial justice in city, state and na
tion. If this is generally done we can
continue to work together and bring back
a chaBtened republican party to its ancient
faith in human rights and national
integrity."
Reviewing the party history, the
statement said:
"In the 1914 and 1916 primaries the
progressive voters of 1912 deliberately and
in overwhelming numbers abandoned the
progressive party. The refusal of the progressive
national committee to favor a
third ticket candidacy did no more than
to make final the judgment entered by
the progressive voters themselves. When
the progressive convention had adjourned
and the entire situation was considered
it was manifest that the end which the
voters had decreed had come?that the
progressive party w&p dead." . Js

IT HAS AMPLE AUTHORITY
Readiness of Government to Inter- SI
vene Believed to Have Relieved
Situation.
President Wilson and all federal
agencies whose offices have tf
been invoked to avert the threat- d;
ened nation-wide railroad strike, hi
while continuing their zeal to be tl
prepared to meet the emergency, ai
are marking time today. di
They are awaiting the psycho- si
logical time for their services to ei
be effective?following the an- tl
nouncement of the strike vote N
now being taken among the 400,- ai
000 railroad employes whose serv- C
ices have to do with transporta- t!
tion. vv
Less Fear of Strike.
It is believed that the situation has SI
been greatly relieved. The fact that ^
the President let it be known that he
is ready to act, even to the extent of
personal appeal to either or both w
parties to the controversy, has appeased
the public fear of a monster ^
strike. It has shown that extreme
measures will be taken, if necessary,
to safeguard the interests of the trav- fr
eling public and the shippers. ea
The attitude of the White House in ha
awaiting the result of the strike vote,
the action of the Senate interstate
commerce committee in tabling the investigation
resolution, and the positive
assertion of the United States board of
mediation and conciliation that it is M
ready to act promptly at the proper 0?
time have given the impression that
the government agencies have the st
crisis well in hand. or
st
Claims Power to Act.
The very fact that the White House
has assumed this attitude is taken as m
an assurance that Judge William L. hj
Chambers, commissioner of mediation
and conciliation, convinced the President
at the White House conference ui
yesterday that the mediation board has
sufficient authority under the Newlands ^
act to handle the case.
It is believed that Judge Chambers cl
showed the President correspondence pj
by letter and telegrams with both the ni
railroads and the labor organizations th
which convinced the President that if
the railroads and their employes are
not able to reach an amicable settlement
the mediation board will be able '
to effect one, acting as mediator or ar- re
bitrator.

:wer than 500 men had struck.
The cars were late in getting- away
om the barns, which led to the belief
rly in the day that a serious tie-up
id been effected.
Unaware of Strike.
Later on only a few lines was any
lay in the operation of cars noticed,
any workers on the way to their place
employment were unaware that a

marked the early hours of the
rike.
The labor leaders asserted that 80 per
nt of the employes of the New York
ailways Company, which operates the
ajority of the surface lines in jttanittan,
had voted to strike.
The elevated and subway lines, which
ere not affected by the strike vote,

no .demands to the company,
ruck in sympathy. Two hundred emoyes
of the surface lines in Queens
irough voted to quit early today. The
rooklyn lines are not involved.
Some minor disorders attended the
claration of the strikes in Manhatn,
and a few arrests were made of
rikers who attempted to interfere
ith the operation of cars. So far as
lown, no one was injured during the
ght.
rhe officials of the New York Railays
Company asserted that only a
lall percentage of their employes had
