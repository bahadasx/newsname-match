Facts About the Car Strike
Disorder grew in the strike this afternoon. The most serious
disturbance was in East Eighty-sixth Street where
strikers, after being roused at a meeting, smashed
windows of cars on the Third, Lexington and Madison
Avenue lines. The yards for the Madison Avenue
cars were also attacked. The police had a furious
battle with the rioters before dispersing them.
Strike leaders asserted two-thirds of the Green car men were
out. and that by 6 o'clock 90 per cent, of those still at
work would quit.

Bloodshed, destruction of property and ugly rioting by strikers
and their men and women sympathizers marked the ending of the first
half day of the strike of the "green car" molormen and conductors after
a noisy noon meeting in a hall at Eighty-sixth Street and Third Avenue.
The battle continued for an hour, breaking out in new spots a block
apart.
The most violent disturbance came at 1 o'clock w'th the adjournment
of a strike meeting at Third Avenue and Eighty-sixth Strest. The men
poured out into the street fighting angry. Two cars were passing In
Eighty-sixth Street. Ccbblestones were Hying throu:h tlie windows al
most before the Icne policeman inside could get to his feet.
Every window in the cars was in slivers before the crews and the
policemen could get to the street. The crews went away through the
crowd where it seemed thinnest with coattails flying.
