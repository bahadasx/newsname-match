answer sped fiv ally the. suggestion of
the Washington Bin eminent for en
la i geniflit of the powers of the roni
inissioii. It is believed, however, tlnr.
thi' rei'ly is generally satisfactory to
tli" administration, and that negotia
tions will .ioceed without delay. A t -jug
Secretary folk wo' not discuss
tlic , uininunioatiun today, say inn lm
had not time to study it.
Three points IVcfoiiible.
Hencial I'arranza says in his
that the
t-isbly"
.Mexican commissioners "pref-,
will discuss the I I'.rce . points 1
oiilhueil in tilt:
Hon of .Inly 1 I.
Mexican coinnuinica -
which are withdrawal
i.f American troops from Mexico, tlic
fiaming of a protocol to cover future
l nriler operations and an investigation
of what interests have promoted bor
der raids. State department officials
me understood to regard this as '(t
I' ast h aving the way open for broad -ir
considerations such as they denir
should the commission be successful
in finding a solution for immediate!
problems.
May Valc Limitation.
It is pesslbl, that in notifying the
Mexican government of the appoint
ment of the American commissioners
and the time and place of the confer
ence, Mr. I'olk will take occasion to
indi ate again that the I'niled States
expect,, tile conferees to lie free from
the dose limitations implied in the
la h Mexican note, but w ill avoid 'iny
detailed expression on thai point. The
t iiininissioii then would be left to ma,i
out its ow n course unless General i.'u r
rana had sonic specific suggestion to
ol'fel.
I'ci'soiinel Not Deleiniined.
There was iiofhing to indicate to
lughl lhat President Wilson had de
rided on the men who will represent
the I'niled Males on the commission,
lie has had nian names under run
sulcatum. It is regarded as probable
that the American membership will be
such as lo conform in a general wav
to ihe Mexican delegation. There are
lm diplomatic or military rcpresenta
tnes among the Mexican commission
ers, nor liny lawyers. I. tils (.'ahrera.
who will head the Mexicans, Is mln
is'er of finance; Ignacio Itonillas ih

however, may prevent his selection!

lei,., I, Mllicrs mentioned include
members of the supreme court an I

Il was expected tonight thai Am
bassador Arredonilo might begin t.
moiiuw a further conference witli Mr
I'" k regarding Ihe time and place I' .1
