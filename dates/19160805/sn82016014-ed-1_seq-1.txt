Complete returns late this afternoon
from 94 of 10S counties, give Fred .

ryer for the Republican nomination
fi.r state auditor.
Walter L. Payne holds a 6,000 lead
over Charles Evans who has jumped
Into second place for state treasurer.
W. D. Ross has a third nomination for
state superintendent by 10,000 plu
rality. Only a few of the important coun

Late official reports from western 1
Kansas counties bore out early predic- '
tions that the vote for Fred Knapp
and Dan Dyer would be Increased in :
the race for auditor. Knapp has a '
lend of 1.300 at noon today over Frank
Organ. The race Is expected to con-
tinue close. While Knapp has a seem- 1
inglv safe lead, yet lobsided returns
from some of the western counties
may be sufficient to upset the Belolt
mnn's present lead. Phenomonal sains
have been made by Dan Dyer in late
- .- 1 V- V. .. 1 1 .-. . V , .1 fmm '1 1
poor third to within striking distance
of first place.
Too much Eli Payne is responsible
for the defeat of Lizzie Wooster for
superintendent. Payne's vote in the
counties where his name came first
and a split of the opposition to the
Ross rule permitted the present super
intendent to slip through for a third
nomination.
Inrk Horses" Run.
Every political observer in Kansas
hrid his dope sheet spoiled in the race
for Republican nominations for state
nuditor and state superintendent. In
both races "dark horse" candidates
were contenders or winners. I'ayne,
who holds a sxfe load for state treas
urer, was always figured in the money.
Hut no poliltcal wise man gave Evans
tnythins but fourth place. Now he is '
in the second position with Wylie W. '
Cook and Matt Welghtman, both fla- j
vorites. in cellar positions. , ;
Frrd Knapp's surprising race for;
the state auditorship is explained by;
the vote of the Progressives. Vet there;
was no candidate tn the running for
whom less sentiment was expressed.
The former Bull Moosers seemingly
took their cue. went to the polls and
voted their sentiments without com
ment. The result has seemingly de
feated Frank Organ, generally listed
as a favorite. It has also crippled
Dan Dyer, listed in all dope sheets as
the one man who might2beat Organ for
the nomination.
Some of the larger counties have
not completed their canvass of the
primary returns. These reports may
not reacn lopena until tonight. It!
ii possible these returns may make i
oranges in tne present relative stand
ing of candidates for state auditor.
The race for state treasurer and su
perintendent, however, is settled on
the face of present returns.

If the Savages can take the series, it
will indicate that they still have a
chance to get into the top running.
Tomorrow's will be the last Sunday

will be only two more Sunday games
those who are behind on their base

BID FOR MOOSE VOTES
Vance McCormlek Crges California
Progressives to Support Wilson.
New Tork. Aug. 6. Chairman
Vance C. McCormlek of the national
Democratic committee has wired an
appeal for Bull Moose aid for Wilson
to the Progressives of California.
Expressnig his regret that he could
not participate in the Wood row Wil
son independence Progressive con
ference set for San Francisco, Chair
man McCormlek telegraphed Presi
dent Joseph S. Thompson :
"By 'radical' I understand one who
goes too far; by 'conservative,' one
who does not go far enough; by "re
actionary,' one who won't go at all. I
suppose that I must be a progressive,
which I take to be one who insists
upon recogniznig new facts, adjusting
policies to facta and circumstances as
they arrive.
"This spirit of progreasivism has ac
tuated all of Woodrow Wilson's pub
lic service. Under his administration,
the major part of the program pro
posed in the Progressive national plat
form of 1912 has been enacted Into
law. "Invisible government,' which is
now making desperate efforts to 'come
back,' was driven from power by his
administration, and will have no place
in Washington so long as he is in the
White House.
"The Democratic national commit
tee welcomes the support of all inde
pendent citizens who share its ideals
and purposes. To the men and women
of California represented at your con
ference it submits itself on its record
as the one available instrumentality
for progressive service."

Germans to Launch Gigantic
Counter Offensive in East.
Petrogrsd, Aug. 5. Russian troops
have crossed the river Sereth south of
P.rody, and In the region of Peniaki
Tchistopady and have consolidated the
ciptured positions, it was officially an
nounced today by the Russian war de
partment. London, Aug. 5. The Germans are
massing both troops and guns on the
eastern front for a great counter-offensive
under von Hindenburg de
signed to stem the Russian advance
against Kovel and Lemberg.
This news was received here from
several neutral points today and was
partly confirmed in dispatches from
Berlin. For several days troop trains
have been leaving Berlin dally, carry
ing reserves to the eastern front. Ber
lin believes the crisis of the war is ap
proaching on the eastern front and for
this reason great crowds are gather
ing daily to bid the departing troops
farewell.
Crown Prince Goes to Galicia.
Field Marshal von Mackensen. who
iraugurated the great German offen
sive against the Russians a year ago,
has joined von Hindenburg on the east
ern front. The Austrian crown prince
recently on the Italian front has as
sumed charge of operations in Galicia.
Reports from Amsterdam today said
the first blow probably would be
struck in the southeast, where the
Slavs have achieved the greatest suc
cess, Hindenburg aiming to throw
back the whole Russian line by driv
ing in the left bank and at the same
time silencing the Rumanian leaders,
who have been urging King Ferdinand
to join the allies. The battle, it is
believed, will gradually spread until
the whole eastern front is involved in
a gigantic struggle comparable to that
of early last summer.
Try to Save Kovel.
It Is too early to determine whether
the strong German counter attack in
the region east of Kovel form the be
ginning of the expected Austro-Ger-man
offensive. The Russian war of
fice admits the evacuation of Rudka
Mirinskaia under heavy Austro-Ger-man
attacks, but the fighting at this
point continues.

Man Keeps "Other Woman"
Until His Affection Dies.
MUST COME BACK ON KNEES
First Love, His Legal Mate,
Beady to Welcome Him Home.
"I Love Husband He Loves
Me He Will Return."
The perfect paragon of patience in
the female species that's the only
place to look for one has been dis
covered. Robert Garver, assistant
county attorney, discovered her.1"-.
She lives In Topeka. She Is mar
ried. She has lost her husband to
another woman but she doesn't want
a divorce. If she wanted a divorce or
if she would have her husband arrest
ed for wife desertion there would be
an excuse for using her name. As it
is, there is no excuse.
"My husband," she told Robert Gar
ver, "is Infatuated with another wo
man. We have been married for seven
years and he has been a good man.
But for some reason or other he has
fallen for this other woman and is
keeping her at a hotel here in town."
"Why don't you get a divorce from
him?" asked Garver.
"No, I don't want a divorce," re
plied the woman. "I love my hus
band and he loves me. He doesn't
know it right now because he is all
muddled over this other woman. But
his infatuation will wear out after a
time. I know him. And when it
wears out he will come back to me on
his knees. No, I don't want a divorce
from him."
"Well, then," said Garver, "why
don't you have him arrested for wife
desertion?"
"Even that would give him a lot of
publicity and would brand him as
something he really Is not," said the
loyal wife. "No, I don't want to have
him arrested. He's a good man and
I love him."
"Well, for heaven's sake what do
you want to do then?" asked Garver.
What She Wanted.
"The point is Just this," said the
woman. "I know his infatuation -fo
this 'other" will fade away in time.
She can't keep the hold on him I have
after seven years of married life. He
will come back to me. " But in the
meantime I've got to live. I thought
that perhaps I could arrange without
any publicity or court action so that
he could pay me some money eacii
week during the pendency of his in
fatuation." Garver was puzzled. He had never
before heard of such a proposal from
an injured wife. But he didn't smile
and he didn't try to shake the wife's
faith in her husband's ultimate faanity.
He said he'd try.
The assistant county attorney com
municated with the husband; the hus
band communicated with a lawyer.
And today the thing was patched up
the way the wife proposed. Itie hus
band agreed, without any angry
words to pay his wife 4 a week as
long as his infatuation for the other
woman holds out. When the end comes
he must either go back to his wife on
his knees as she predicts he will or
continue to pay the four dollars a
week.
Duo to Blow up.
The wife believes the infatuation is
about due to blow up. She thinks
her rival's Influence has about reached
its limit but she ran out of money
before the infatuation ran out.
"I never before heard of anything
of the kind, said Garver. "I was aston
ished at the woman's proposal, but I
was more astonished when the hus
band responded to it without a word.
Apparently the arrangement is satis
factory all around. Of course we
could have the husband and the worn
an with whom he is1 said to be living
arrested and punished, but I am going
to see this Injured wife through in her
own way if possible.
The man In the case is employed In
a business house on Kansas avenue.
His name and that of the woman his
wife complains of are on file in the

THE IOWA PAPER
Why Governor Capper and Pelletier
"Let Go."
Concerning the recent purchase and
sudden sale of the Sioux City Daily
News by Governor Capper, in an
nouncing the second sale and the sus
pension of the paper, the Sioux City
Journal says the amount involved was
practically the same in both the pur
chase and the sale by Governor Cap
per. The Sioux City Tribune says: "Aft
er purchase of the paper a number of
employes of Capper publications came
to Sioux City and investigated the field
and the prospects of maintaining the
paper here. What they may have re
torted is conjecture, but it is known
here on the streets that the advertisers
did not encourage them. On the sub
scription side the situation was still
more discouraging and Mr Capper and
his associates concluded to close down
the paper."
One Sioux City business man writes
to the State Journal: "The sale and
resale of the Sioux City News to and
by Governor Capper showed the Sioux
City people that Mr. Pelletier waa an
Interested party in the ownership.
The Capper advertising force was here
for several days. They talked with
the business men, but the business
men did not take kindly to having a
merchant competitor in the newspaper
business. Mr. Capper could not break
into the newspaper field in Sioux City
in a hundred years without being on
the ground. - The business men here
did not want a third paper." '

Turks Are Repulsed.
The latest dispatches to the war of
fice, filed at dusk Friday, said that the
Turks had made no gains against the
strongly fortified British line. The
cambat was being waged over the
sands in a temperature of 100 degrees
in the shade.
On the southern flank the British
not only repelled Turkish attacks but
captured between 400 and 600 pris

BASlBAUTANS!
Do Yon Know You Are Liable
to Lose the Savages!
Poor Attendance Causes Club to
Drop $1,000 a Month.
A big gob of gloom is liable to drop
out of a clear sky some fine hot day,
and when the dust and debris are
cleared away Topekans will find that
they no longer have a Western league
baseball team to advertise the city and
furnish amusement to its citizens.
It was learned today from an au
thentic source that the management of
the local club is losing at least $1,000
a month and has been losing this
amount since the opening of the sea
son. The attendance has been poor
and has been steadily falling off.
The cause of this condition is im
material, but no sane business man
can expect another sane man to try
to continue to promote baseball here
under these conditions. John Savage,
the local club owner, is making no
howl, no complaint and is saying noth
ing other than that he is continually
losing money. But it stands to reason
that if conditions continue, the end of
Western league baseball in the Kansas
capital is not far away.
Is Topeka Too Small?
Cheap automobilas and golf are
Mamed bv mai.y for the poor attend
ance, but others point out that To
peka, one of tne smallest cities in tue
leftfirue. cannot hope to maintain a
franchise without extra effort and that
as thi3 extra effort is not being made
the end must come possibly before
the close of this season if the out
look does not get brighter.
Tomorrow local fans will have an
opportunity to see two games for the
price of one. Also, they will have a
Chance to see the league leaders in
action. Tomorrow's attendance may
have a great deal to do with keeping
baseball in Topeka. la a hint sum

Wife Advised Suff Support.
Never before in the history of poli
tics has a candidate been accompanied
on a speaking tour by his wife. But
Mrs. Hughes is almost an oracle in
the family of the former Justice. Her
husband consults frequently with her,
values her opinion of people and
things and on this occasion when he
is seeking the presidency, he is more
than ever anxious to draw upon her
advice.
