NEGRO MASONS CELEBRATE
GOLDEN JUBILEE
The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Missouri .and Jurisdic
tion in its Annual Communication Will Have a Record
Breaking Attendance and a Wonderful Program
LARGE DELEGATIONS AND MANY
DISTINGUISHED' VISITORS EXPECTED
By Benj. Vt Longdon.
As this issue the Sun goes" to press
the members of the Masonic Grand
Lodge and many subordinates as well
are. preparing to attend the semi-centennial
of Masonry to be held at "Kan
sas City, Mo., next week. The oc
casion is appropriate for an article
dealing briefly with the past, the
present and especially the future of
this virile fraternity. Yet we are con
tent at looking ahead because of the
knowledge we have of the work of
. Prof. Joe E. Herriford, who during
his leisure hours followed the bent
of a discriminating taste in litera
ture and held us in suspense with ar
ticles on "Fifty Years or Masonry"
until the very last word. It Is there
fore vitally Important that we be
come acquainted with the Masonic
history of this jurisdiction at least.
.Intelligence and strength can be at
tained only through painstaking study
of facts that will lead to knowledge;
which it is enterig is In keeping of
experienced, courageous and capable
men.
No other fraternal organization has
had such extremes of exaltation and
depression. No other has produced
so many men who are llteraally
"seers" gifted with vision to arouse,
to Inspire, to lead. In every subor
dinate body are to be found the so
cial, political, educational and reli
gious leaders of the community. We
write this perfectly mindful of the
fact that many a man who reads this
merited encouragement will not ad
mit even to his neighbor the justness
of our claim. That type ot man is
the big snag that has to be watched
In the channel of fraternal life. He
and his associates have ruined many
an organization, and that one only in
which vigilant watch is kept is suc
cessful,, For this "reason the primary
purpose of the progressive fraternity
is to familiarize its membership with
the statutes, principles and activities

for all Intelligent action Is'based onj
knowledge. In looking ahead, there
fore, we Bhbuld consider that the
growth of Masonry during tho past
years can Indicate bu.t one thing 0e
fratennlty In harmony with the spirit
of tho age., In others words, the Ma
sonic fraternity has found, its proper
place in fraternal social life of this
jurisdiction; and it Is undoubtedly
the richer at the end ot fifty years'
because of the splendid training
Grand Master Crews and Jils prede
cessors have had for judicial and. ad
ministrative work. And, all in all,
the leadership ot this fraternity dur
ing the last half ot the century upon
than ever justify Its claim that a
good Mason is a good citizen. Every
centennial, yes, every semi-centennial,
it will more than encourage Buch
celebrations representing the frater
nal spirit of the age, incomparable in
its enthusiasm, Its achievements, its
benefits, Its protection, its charity
and Its love to fellowman.
