'EPPERMINTS AID
POUCE CLERK, SO
MISS GLASS FINDS
I have always wondered who it is at the police
station who answers the telephone and assures the ex
cited person at the other end that "an officer will be
right out."
As a police reporter Saturday I found out. He is
a big, black-haired person named Frank DuCett, whose
official title is Report Clerk. 1 sat at his desk and
patched him for a little.
W He sits at a big desk with two telephones on it.
x)n a table beside him is a typewriter and as he receives
a call he reports all the details of it on specially prepared
blanks, and slips the blanks into a looseleaf file for
future reference. He also interviews those who com®
in person to voice their woes.
He's a busy man—is Mr. DuCett. and he is a won
derful combination of diplomat, detective, city directory
and philosopher.
He has to be a diplomat to soothe the outraged
souls of those who can't see why he is wasting time
in asking questions that seem irrelevant.
He has to be a detective to realize that when an
hysterica! woman describes a burglar as more than six
feet high, with black hair, he is probably short and
red-headed.
His philosophy is i mingling of thinking
that everything is rather funny when you
lis think it over, and eating peppermints.
\T When I went in yesterday he was busy matching
nickels with the telephone operator to see who would
buy the next sack of peppermints.

Vigorous protest against the

tariffs has been filed with the
Interstate commerce commis
sion Saturday by the Seattle
Chamber of Commerce, along
with similar complaints from
many other Pacific Coast and
Interior eltias.
Th® charge is made that the
railroads havs not carried out
the Intentlo.i of the commis

from the Atlantic coast to the
Pacific In accordance with an
order the commission entered
recently, and that the new
schedule works a hardship
against both Inland and coast
ahippars.
In soma Instances, It was learn
