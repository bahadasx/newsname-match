Austrian Report.
BERLIN, (via wireless to Sayvllle)
Aug. 5.—Excepting on the Stochod
river and Brody fronts, the Russians
have abandoned their continued at
tacks, probably because of heavy
losses, said £n official statement from
the Austrian war office under date of
August 3, received here today.
"In the Russian war theatre, a hos
tile detachment entered a small sec
tion of our trenches, but was com
pletely ejected," it was stated. "South
west of Brody, Russian attacks were
repulsed. Russian advances on the
Sarny-Kovel railway failed. Other
wise the enemy has been consider
ably more quiet, ascribable to his
heavy losses."

Mter a shotgun battle on one of tho

the whole Fleury-Thiaumont front,
repeating their tactics of the previous
night when they moved forward in
dense columns against the newly won
French positions.
(Desperate 'bayonet fighting again
occurred in the streets of Fleury,
the war office indicated. The Ger

repulsed by the French who defend

ruined buildings and barricades.
The attack by which the French
again captured the Thiaumont work,
was delivered yesterday afternoon.
French batteries first silenced Ger
man guns which had forced the
French out of the position in Thurs
day's fighting. Infantry then sprang
into the attack and within a few min

the redoubt. The French immediately
began organizing their positions and

LONDON", Aug. 5.—The Germans
are massing both troops and guns on
the eastern front for a great counter
offensive under Von Hindenburg, de
signed to 'stem the Russian advance

This news was received here from
several neutral points today and was

Berlin believes the crisis of the war

It is too early to determine whether
the strong German counter attacks in

WASHINGTON, Aug. 5.—On the
heads of the "generals of the re

for lives lost In Mexico, Democratic
Whip Lewis charged today In a sen

•Lewis announced his speech as an

by Charlfia E." Hughes in his accept

'He declared that irresponsible

charge that not
until the captains of the republican
party sRot at the president of the
United States, did the 'Mexican out
laws shoot at the soldiers of the
American president.'
The Mexican issue, he asserted, had
4)een^pfcl^ ii fcir purpose* of ex
pediency, only after the prosperity
had made the favorite republican
doctrine, the tariff, impracticable.
"The cry has gone forth 'Mexico is
the issue.' The issue, mind you! Not
that there is a principle to be vindi
cated, Justice to be asserted. No!
But that Mexico Is to be the political
issue.
"The army is summoned—the mer
cenary, the concessionaire, the Europ
ean bond holder, the mining buccan
neers, the land pirates, the pillagers
of the peons, the oppressors of lib
erty and all this procession of blood
tarnshed votaries led by the republi
can nominee, Charles Evans Hughes.
Mr. Hughes declares that Wilson

of Huerta that it was the obligation
of diplomacy to recognize him. With
the murdering Iborgias, Hughes would
exclaim:
'Stand not on morals, but .on
power—'tis bloody but hath re
wards.'
Huerta having been eliminated,
peace could have been restored with
either Villa or Carranza at the gov
ernment's head, Lewis said, had not
American financial forces and repub
lican leaders determined to keep
boiling the pot of Mexican disorders.
"But by a false display of the na
tion's sentiment toward Mexico," ho
continued, "Che republican masters
encouraged every outlaw and cut
throat to feel privileged to assail
whatever represented Wilson or his
policy. These knew they would have
the support of a great party in Amer
ica which for years had been success"
ful in electing presidents.
"Thus it was that just a month
after Senator Root had struck his
keynote, .his opposition of a demo
cratic president, tho murderers dash
ed into Columbus, N. M.
The .bandits of Villa found their
allies in the leaders of the republican
party. All were for the destruction
of an American policy and American
president.
By the doctrine of law which holds
responsible those who set in motion
the machinery which ends in the mur
der of a iman. the republican plat
form builders who denounced their
president, were the perpetrators of
the death of these Americans. When
they shot at the president of the
United States they summoned also
the outlaws of Villa and Carranza to
kill his soldiers."
