HEAVY LOSSES BEING
SUFFERED BY GERMANS.
(BV ASSOCIATED PRCSSI
PARIS, August 5?All German attacks
on the French positions last
night were repulsed, says the ollicial
statement issued this afternoon, the
Germans sustaining heavy losses. A i
bombardment of the most violent
character took place over the entire
' sector of Thiaumont and Fleury. The
battle lasted from It o'clock last
night until this morning, the Germans
making linsucessful efforts,
the statement adds, to drive the
French from the Thiaumont works.
After a spirited engagement in the
village of Fleury the situation is
without appreciable change.
The situation in the region of the
river Somme is quiet.
Four German aeroplanes were
brought down by the French on Friday.
The success at Thiaumont is iouksd
uron as more important evidence
of the enerpy of the French infantry
than as a military achievement.
The work is so swept by the
artilcry of either side as to be of litI
tie use to the possessor.
French olltcers point to the fact
that the efforts of the Germans are
now restricted to the Fleury-Thiatimont
section as an evidence of the
{. rowing weakness of the invading
forces in the flleuse region. The i
French have succeeded in clearing
the approaches to the Souville Tavannes

that a strike by the 250,00U railroad'

the Nevada Railroad Commission hasr

into the merits of either side of the |
controversy, the resolution says:
"The principles of arbitration arei

In Transportation of Perishable
Foodstuffs Are Made
by the Railroad.
BALTIMORE, AUGUST 5.?Expertinents
in the transportation or
perishable foodstuffs in refrigerator
cars have been recently run by the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad under
the supervision of the United States
government authorities, to determine
the best conditions under which to
carry eggs, poultry, and like commodities.
This is in line with the
pure food research work. The maintenance
of an even temperature
throughout such shipments effects the
quality of certain commodities. The
oxperemints were conductor with a
shipment of eggs from Missouri points
to Klinira. N. Y.. in three refrigerator
cars of different design including a
new one recently huilt in Baltimore
and Ohio shops embodying plans devised
by government experts.
The eggs were assembled at St.
T/ittis where the cars were iced preparatory
to their movement to destination
and a careful record was kept of
the quality of ice consumed, the temperature
of each car and the cost. A
dynamometer car of the Baltimore and
Ohio was attached to the shipment to
record the time in transit and at terminals
as well as the effect of shock
in handling. The shipment was routed
by way of Youngstown, O., and delivered
lo the Erie railroad for movement

While no circular announcing new

The production this season Is the lowI

to be exceedingly scarce. Our stocks

still fill many specifications and glass
bought at present prices is bound to

Within the last few days prices
have gone up from ten to fifteen per
cent and certain premium sizes and
qualities are being quoted at a much
higher price. Wages and materials
will positively be higher during the
blast of 1916-17, which certainly will
make a corresponding increase in the
gelling price. Jobbers should get the
top of the market for their stocks and
as they have the bulk of the glass
