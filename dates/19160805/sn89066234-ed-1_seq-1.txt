In a work or fiction by Edgar
Burroughs "Kerohaok" is describ
ed as the king of the anthropoids,
and when something snapped in
his wicked little brain," he want
ed to kill. The story continues:
Kerchak, king or the great an
thropoids, had gone war-mad
Something had snapped in his
wicked little brnin.
The lu6t to kill was upon him.
Kerchak was a patriot of the
jungle.
And, though we of the human
breed have left our anthropoidal
ancestors far behind, yet the
ulood or Kerchak or the Apes still,
at times, boils in our veins.
Suddenly something snaps in
tricked little brains, and the lust
to kill the war craze is upon us.
It is everywhere, and all down
the ages.
The naked savages are sitting
sullenly aroun d the campfire.
Suddenly one of the braves arises,
and, with
crouching body, teeth
set like a vise, spear deftly pois

Something lias snapped in his

Suddenly is heard the howl of the

Something has snapped in their

They are prepared to follow the

Once, we killed for the sheer
love of killing.
Again, we killed because our
palates craved the taste of hu

Then we altered our casus belli,
and killed to bind in bondage the

Then we learned tu kill in or

Now we kill to force the con

THE HE8SUN FLV,
The Kicker editor is not a far
mer, but he can give you the ben
efit of w hat experts have to say
In Missouri we h;ivo an agricul
tural college that is supposed to
work out the problems of the
fanner un a scientific basis, of
the havoc brought on by the he
sian fly in the crop just harvested,
T. J - Talbert oi the Missouri col
lege lay :
"it is not necessary to quit
growing wheat. Tiie Hessian fly
may be killed, starved, und pre
vented by practicing the best
farming methods to secure an In
creased yield of wheat.
July or very eurly August plow
ing buries tne liessiau ll,v BUd

wheat per acre than septemboi
plowing, it is olteu advisable to
disk the wheat stubble ground
and then plow tnrec or four a 'eeks
later. The disking W ih mash, de
stroy, and expose many of the
Hies in the Uaxseed stage. It win
also conserve moisture and make
plowing much easier.
Cultivating the plowed ground
through the summer, especially
after rains, keeps down volunteer
wheat and kills and starves the
fly. It also conserves moisture
and makes a better seed bed for
wheat. The fly feeds almost en
tirely upon wheat but it may be
found upon rye aud barley,
Wheat sown on or soon after
the fly-free date is practically
free from Hessian fly injury dur
ing the fall and winter. Careful
observation and experiments have
shown that the fly-free dates are
generally as early as the wheat
should be sown to secure a maxi
mum yield regardless of the fly.
For the northern third of Missouri
the safe sowing date is about Oc
tober 1, central third October
and southei n third October 1 i.
The College of Agriculture will on
request furnish information on
the fly-free date for each county
of the state.
Every wheat grower should try
to put into practice the above
measures. A united fight against
the fly .cannot be emphasized too
strongly, because one farmer that
fails to destroy volunteer wheat
or that sows his wheat too early
may breed enough flies to damage
his neighbors' wheat crops badly
the following spring.
Many of the best and most suc
cessrul wheat growers of the
state have found these measures
piacticul und effectiv e in the con
trol or the fly and they have also
greatly increased their yields at
the same time."

HOW LOXC OH. HOW LONG?
How much longer will the great
mass of the American people nl
low themselves to be fooled by
the clan-trap and catch-phrases
or the rotten old party politi
cians? With the exception of the cam
paigns of 1898 and 1900 we
have had the tarirf as the 'para
mount taboo," In these years we
also had tariff, but the "para
mounts" were free silver ami
anti-Imperialism
Both free silver and anti-imperialism
served their purpose and
have been put iu cold Storage.
Bttt the tarirf is always with us
because its rakery is ics under

have given us what they called
tariff for protection." The last
dose we got was under the Tuft
administration, and the country
was so disgusted with that ad
ministration that Taft got but
eight electorial votes in the en
tire nation.
But the Democrats were going
to fix it and they did. They are
bitterly opposed to a protective
tariff, to hear them tell it. but
favor a "tarirf for revenue only.''
In either case it is an indirect
tax and the consumers pay it;
und I can't see that it makes any
difference whether it is called a
protective tariff fir a tarilf for
revenue onl.v.

TUG O.VLV ISSUE.
It is being prett.v generally cuii
ct eded that there is no real issue
between the two old parties tins
year. Their national platforms
are alike, and theii presidential
candidates have exactly the same
fundamental Ideas concerning
government, Both agree that
there should be harinon.v between
tapltal ami labor. auJ neither
knows of an.v wav to bring about
' this harinonj except tu turn the

There is but one political las te
