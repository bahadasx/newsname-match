DEMOCRATS BROKE PLEDGES.
Rodenberg Blames Party For Loss of
United States Prestige.
"Washington, Aug. 6.—Excorciating
Wilson's regime for extravagance for
bringing American industry to a stag
nation from which the world war alone
rescued it, for a violation of pledges,
for a forfeiture of national prestige, and
for the Mexican record, Representative
Rodenberg, of Illinois, today launched
a vigorous attack on the democratic
party.
The first part of his address wes de
voted to a denunciation of the influence
of the south on national affairs.
"The democratic party is distinctly
and essentially sectional in character,
controlled in principle and purpose by
the men of the south, many of whom,
cling to a buried past," he said. "Indi
vidually they are agreeable, affable,
courteous, but collectively as a political
aggregation.they are an abomination in
the sight of the Lord. Having'control
of all committees thely exercise a dom
inant influence wholly out of proportion
to the south's importance.
'The south has no conpention of in
dustrial needs of the "great manufac
turing centers of ther north or of the
iNrage scale we are Compelled to pay,
and cares less. All. these gentlemen are
concerned about Is,to find a market for
their cotton."
He bitterly denounced the democratic
claims of responsibility for current
prosperity, by showing the swift crum
bling of good times after the Under
wood tariff went into effect.
Referring to Mr. Wilson's frequent
reversals of policy the Illinois congress
man remarked with reference to the
president's "single track mind," that
every single track railway has a turn
table. He surmised that the president
had backed onto that at the beginning
of the administration and had been go
ing around ever since.

Penalty for Fete Day Celebration Will
Be Ignored.
London, Aug. 5.—The city of Brus

11,000,000 imposed by Germany in con
sequence of the demonstration 'which
took place at the Belgian capital on
July 21, the national fete day, says
a dispatch from The Hague to the
Exchange Telegraph company. A
serious crisis is expected.
Acting Burgomaster Lemonnier, the
dispatch adds, has sent a letter to
Gen. von Bissing, the German governor
of Belgium, flatly declining to pay the
fine. He says it was imposed on the
public because of its patriotic senti
ment and therefore is illegal and in
admissible.
The director of the Belgian National
banks at Antwerp has been deported
by the German authorities "because
of his refusal to pay them 400,000,000
francs in exchange for a mere paper
receipt."

Indies. The National Tidende says:
"In a question of such great im
portance for the whole nation the gov

its worst antagonists would not have
believed it capable of. Nobody but
the Danish government would have
risked such a course."
On the other hand the paper polntis
out that Denmark several times at-„

Republioan National Gathering Ac

—Hughes Ready to Start oiv Western
Campaign Tour.
Washington, Aug. 5.—Senator Lewis,
the democratic whip, spoke In the sen
ate today In reply to the attack upon
the administration made by Charles E.
Hughes, in his speech accepting the
republican nomination.
Republican strictures upon the ad
ministration's Mexican policy Senator
Lewis denounced as "treasonable." He
charged that the clause of the repub
lican platform repudiating interference
with the internal affairs of .Mexico
was responsible for the massacre of
troops at Carrizal.
"Xot until the captains of the re
publican party shot at the president
of the United States did the Mexican
outlaws shoot at the American sol
diers," he said. The platform declara
tion he characterized as a "summons
to Carranza and Villa to revenge the
entrance of American soldiers into
Mexico and the interference of Am
erica in her Internal affairs."
"It was the republican convention,"
said Mr. Lewis, "which slew the sol
diers at Carrizal," and he assailed ef
forts of the republican leaders to make
Mexico the issue "without regard to
facts, equity or justice."
"Revolt against the government at
Washington as to Mexico—That is the
issue," he declared.
"Denounce the president as to Mexico
—for that is the issue. Make con
temptible your own country before the
world whenever you can, for that is
the issue. Humiliate your own fellow
man by holding his country and his
president up before the world as un
worthy the support of his countrymen
or^tfTe respect of foreigners,

would like to spend every cent of the
republican fund to send the Illinois
senator's address over the country.
"I have just listened to the most re
markable harangue, the like of whiph I
never heard on the stump, and which
I never expected to hear in the halls
of congress."

is expected to attempt to get immigra
tion legislation passed by adding it to
the measure as an amendment.

ment to deny interstate carriage to the
product of any farm which is material
for the products of any mill cannery,
workshop, factory or manufacturing es
tablishment whioh employs children
