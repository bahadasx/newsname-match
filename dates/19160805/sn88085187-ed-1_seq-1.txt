Her daughter, who Is only 16
yiiirs of age, dropped out of
sight five weeks ago. The police
and other officials have made no
public report of the case, but
have uotilied Mrs. Harrison that
they believe it is useless to BOB*
tinue the search.
Drills (lut of si.hi
According to I lie mother, who
is frantic with grief over the dis
appearance, Anthla was an inno
cent, unsentimental schoolgirl.
and had no love affairs.
During a liriel' illness of tho
mother. Anthla became acquaint
ed with one or two young men,
and went out with them even
ings, but showed no particular in
terest in any of them.
Five weeks ago she dropped
out of sight, without leaving any
thing to indicate why or where
she had gone. A few days later
the police located her trunk at
the I'nion station and returned it
to Mrs. Harrison.
The mother learned that her
daughter had become acquainted
with a magazine solicitor, who
had made remarks to her in Se
attle that he was going to "steal
the prettiest little girl in Taco
ma."
Mayor (lives Aid.
Police officers decided that the
girl had become infatuated with a
soldier at tlie American lake en
campment and that she had fol
lowed the troops to the Mexican
border, but gave no reasons for
the theory.
"I feel sure that something
serious has happened to Anthia,"
cried Mrs. Harrison. "She would
surely have left me some word,
because we were the best of
friends. I know that she had no
love affairs. The police don't
seem to be interested about her
disappearance, and 1 cannot do a
thing myself to find her."
Mayor Fawcett promised to
make a deep investigation of the
case, and gave the widow, who is
destitute, a $10 bill to pay her ex
penses in a further search nt
Seattle.
"It looks as if the girl had
been abducted, or else induced
by some man to run away," said
the mayor.
Police Suppress I'm**.
"The police have kept the case
dark, instead of giving it all the
light It can stand, and as a result
there is no trace or the girl.
"I have the names of men who
are suspected in connection with
the case, and 1 am going to see
to It that a thorough search is
begnu at once."

Cache In McKinley Park Haymow
COUNTY BOOZE
SLEUTHS BUSY
Discovery of a midnight bar
carefully hidden under a hay
stack in a barn at llth and M led
to the raiding of the McKinley
Pari, drug store Saturday and the
arrest of James E. Shutts, the
proprietor.
The quantity of booze confis
cated, together with two other
hauls made by the county during
the last 24 hours was enough to
distribute a strong odor of alco
liol throughout the court house.
The police, have been watching
the drug store, at 3.". 10 Mc-
Kinley avenue, for several weeks,
but have obtained no results ex
cept the arrest of one of the
clerks who was discovered carry
ing booze from the place and
fined $100.
It developed, says county of
ficers, that while the store has
been running apparently legally
during the daytime, the proprie
tor would close his store In the
evening and adjourn to the hay
mow, there to deal out whiskey
to Ills customers sit $7 a gallon
during the midnight hours.
Trail Leads to Haymow
The discovery of this hay mow
was made by County Detectives
Shaw and Jacobs after midnignt
last night.
The two detectives trailed a
suspicious looking automobile to
Pacific avenue and 4 oth, where
they held It up. They also found
another suspicious machine In the
same neighborhood. They held
up the machines but found no
booze.
At midnight they saw the first
machine going up Jefferson aye.
They stopped it at Center street
and caugiit Jack Olson and Frank
Johnson with five gallons of whin-
key.
They said they were going to
Dupont.
Secret Room in Store
After threats and persuasion
they said the booze came from
the McKlnley park drug store,
and that the proprietor kept It In
the barn of Harvey C. Kellogs,
21.95 East M.
Shaw and Jacobs w^nt to the
.barn and found a barrel of whisky
covered by hay.
__. From there. Uiey went to lie
drug store. A search of the store
proper failed to reveal anything.
But in a secret room on the sec
ond floor' Shaw and Jacobs un
covered one barrel of alcohol,
one"li_ir barrel bf wl Isky an'l 100
quarts -of bottled^ whisky.

They also discovered an empty
barrel, the contents of which, they
say, have been sold within a week.
All the booze was confiscated.
Shutts was arrested, then releas
ed on $00 cash bond.
The automobile, a big rumbling
affair, is being held by the coun
iy.

RAID PLANNED ON
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE
Ml Mil M'llltllil
BY THE EDITOR
C [tough, to be pretty plain to almost any intelligent citizen, with tlio primary election only
i month away, that tne next governor of this state will be:
Ernest Lister, democrat, or
Henry Mcßride, progressive republican, or
One of several reactionary republican candidates.
Cor the Btandpat candidates in the field, McNeeley of Tacoma, Lee of Seattle and Hartley of
BJverett appear to be the leaders.
A very desperate effort is going to be made by the usual combination <»f special interest.}.—
the traction crowd, the party hoK_.es, the hreweiy owners and others—to "put over" one of this
trio. In short, the usual attempted raid on the slate house is under way.
Of Mt-Neeley, Fierce county husiness man, I have no criticism to make. Of McNeeley, the
politician, little need he said —it is enough bo recall that his allitude is the attitude of any other
special interest, narrowly partisan, perfectly "regular" reactionary.
Hartley appears at this writing to he the special thirling of the employers' association, and
the democrats charge that he is also the "wet" candidate. At least, he has little id' positive ex
cellence in his political record to commend him.
C George Lee, as I have pointed out before, his been notable chiefly as a fine little hunk of
. "putty" in the hands of professional politicians. He has been handpicked by certain party
newspapers and other old guarders as their candidate. Whether his handpickers will remain
true to him is another question.
Lee, as chairman of the industrial insurance hoard, bequeathed .John F. Gillies to the present
administration.
As chairman of the puhlic service commission his term was marked hy the scandal of one of
the state engineers holding up the City of Fentralia for a large fee in a valuation case, though the
state was supposed to do it free.
When he stepped out of office it was to enter the service of some of the very corporations he
had been supposed to regulate while state official. As such hireling he lobbied publicly for no
torious senate hill No. 4b, which sought to perpetuate all existing franchises and intended to ex
clude all new private companies and all public corporations from ever securing a competing fran
chise.
No, Lee won't do. Hartley won't do. McNeeley won't do.
C Henry Mcßride was •governor of "Washingt »n from 1901 to 1906, He impressed the state
with three things: That he is independent that his word is good,that his appointments
were made on tlie basis of efficiency.
Mcßride fought for the establishment of the railway eomniission. He secured the passage
of a law which abolished railway passes, thus killing off that "legitimized" bribe of legislators
and state officials.
HIS INDEPENDENCE COST HIM A RE NOMINATION, FOR THE POLITICAL
BOSSES CONTROLLED THE CONVENTION IN THOSE DAYS. The railroad lobbyists
beat him. Mcßride's administration was a great step forward in the interests of cleaner politics
and state administration.
Should Mcßride be the republican nominee and Lister the democratic choice, the people of
the state can feel themselves secure, no matter who is finally elected. Should McNeeley, or Lee,
or Hartley be the republican choice, the people will have good cause for worry. If the people do
not want a recurrence of the political bossism of other days, The Times sincerely believes it their
duty to go into the republican primaries and nominate Henry Mcßride.
