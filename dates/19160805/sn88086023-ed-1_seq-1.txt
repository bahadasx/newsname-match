URGES THREE ROUTES
OVER BLUE MOUNTAINS
Three good roads over the Blue
Mountains are being urged by A. F.
Alexander of the Cp-to-The-Tlmes
Magazine of Walla Walla, who has
lieen In the city this week . He con
siders the building of these roads one
of the essential factors in the devel
opment of eastern Oregon and south
eastern Washington.
Mr. Alexander thinks that ono
road across the mountains should be
liullt from Pomoroy, Washington, to
Enterprise, Oregon, one from Walla
Walla by way of Toll Gate to the
Grande Ronde valley and the present
road from Pendleton to La Grande
improved.
He states that steps have already
bean taken looking to the building of
the Toll Gate road and expects to
see it put through in the near future.
Pomeroy people he declares are
strong for the eastern route. The
present road from Pendleton to La
Grande is in such shape, he says, us
to deter auto tourists from coming
this way. Mr. Alexander thinks ths
building of the three roads would
not hurt any community commercial
ly but would aid in building up all
of them.
