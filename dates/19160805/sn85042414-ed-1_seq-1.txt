REPUBUCANS
IN THE SENATE
Senator Lewis, Democratic
Whip, Makes Startling
Charges.
CAUSED CARRIZAL
MASSACRE, HE SAYS
G. O. P. Convention Re
sponsible, He Maintains
in His Address.
Washington, Aug. 6.—Senator Lew
is, democratic whip, spoke in the sen
ate today, replying to the attack upon
the administration by Charles E.
Hughes in his acceptance of the presi
dential nomination.
The republican strictures upon the
administration's Mexican policy, Lewis
denounced as unreasonable. He
charged that the clause in the repub
lican platform' repudiating interfer
ence In the internal affairs of Mexico
was responsibly for the massacre of
troops at Carrlzal.
"Not until the captains of the re
publican party shot at the president
of the United States did Mexican out
laws shoot at the soldiers of the
American president," he said. The
platform declaration Lewis character
ized as "a summons to Carranza and
Villa to revenge the entrance of
American soldiers into Mexico, and
the interference of America in her
Internal affairs."
"It was the republican convention,"
said Lewis, "which slew the soldiers
at Carrlzal." He assailed the efTorts
of the republican leaders to make
Mexico an issue "without regard to
facts, equity or justice."
"Revolt against the government at
Washington as to Mexico—that is the
issue," he said. "Denounce the presi
dent as to Mexico—for that is the
issue make contemptible your own
country before the worlcl whenever
you can—for that fs the issue. Hu
milate your own fellowmen by hold
ing this country and its president he
fore the world as unworthy of the
support of-his countrymen or the re
spect of foreigners."
TEN CENT LOAF OF
BRfcAD IS DEMAND
Chicago, Aug. 5.—The five cent
loaf of bread must' go:
•This is the cry with which 400 Chi
cago bakers departed last nijrht for
"Sfftt^I^ke City, Utah,' to attend the
annual convention of the National As
sociation at -Master Bakers and to at
torn |t to persuade that body that ten
cents Is the lowest price at which a
fair sized loaf of bread can be sold
with profit.
In the party were scores of bakers
from eastern cities. They will be
Joined enroute by other members of
the trade.
J. M. Bell, secretary of the national
organization explained before his de
parture ihe reasons for the bakers In
sistence rithat the "dime loaf" should
replace the "nickel loaf."
"The iimall loaf is costing the baker
all his profits," he said.
"In Its making is the added cost
of cutting, marketing and waste
which does not enter into the making
of a big loaf. The big loaf will keep
the price of bread down."
The steadily Increasing cost of the
Ingredients of bread, he said, make
necessary the proposed increase in
the product.

NEW INVENTION MAKES
ZEPPELINS INEFFECTIVE
London, Aug. 5,—The ineffective
ness of last night's raid on the east
coast of England by six Zeppelins—
the fourth during the present dark,
moon—is attributed toy many London
ers to the operation of a mysterious
new electrical device.
It is believed that the government
is using an electrical invention which
wrests the control of the Zeppelins'
rudders from the pilots and either
steers the big ships where they do not
want to go or so upsets the compass
of the machines that it is impossible
to do effective bomb throwing.

English Army Withstands
Terrific Assault—Rus
sians Retreat.
Paris, Aug. 5.—All German attacks
on French positions last night were
repulsed, it is officially stated, the
Germans losing heavily. A violent
bombardment occurred over the en
tire sector of Thiaumont and Fleury,
the Germans making unsuccessful ef
forts to drive the French from Thiau
mont work.
After a spirited engagement in the
village of Fleury, the situation is
withoui'appreciable change. The bat
tle continues to rage north of Verdun,
generally with the advantage to the
French. The defenders, after beating
off repeated counter attacks by the
Germans, again took the offensive and
recaptured Fleury and the celebrated
Thiaumont work. The. success' at
Thiaumont is looked upon as more
important evidence of the energy of
the French infantry, and not a great
military achievement.
Turks Attack British.
London, Aug. 5.—British positions
near Romani, east of Port Said, are
being attacked by 14,000 Turks, it is
officially slated.
The Turks, attacking along a front
seven to eight miles, so far have been
repulsed. Romani village Is near the
Mediterranean coast, 22 miles east of
the Suex canal.
Four to five hundred Turks were
captured at Romani.
The announcement says the fighting
is going in the Britishers' favor, with
the ships of the royal navy "rendering
valuable service from the bay of
Tina." The temperature reached 100
degrees in the shade while the fight
ing was at its height
British Made Big Advance.
London, Aug. 5.—The main second
line system on the front, 2,000 yards
north of Pozieres, on the Somme front,
was captured by the British, it is offi
cially stated.
Advance is claimed by the British
on part of the line where their gains
itv the offensive movem^t- sxiWJwj«e
been less pronounced than eoewhere
on this front. The gain, if main
tained, will effect a- material straight
ening out of the line in the sector be
tween Pozierres and Thispval.
Russians Retreat.
Berlin, Aug. 5.—Russian detach
ments, which penetrated the German
positions across the river Sereth, near
Ratyseye were forced to retreat, it Is
officially announced. Near Miedzygory
and Tchistopady, the Russians are
making a stand on the southern bank
of the river.
Turks Claim Success.
Constantinople, Aug. 2.—(Via Lon
don) Aug. 5.—(Delayed.)—Repulses
for the Russians in Armenia and for
British forces on the Sinai peninsula
are chronicled in the official state
ment given out by the war office. The
announcement says that in a five days'
battle in the Agnott sector, Armenia,
the Russians lost more than 3,000
men killed. The statement reads:
"Irak front—The situation is up
changed.
"Persian front—Our troops are pur
suing the retreating Russians from
Sakiz and have reached Buguan to
the northward.
"Causasian front—In the sectors of
Bitlis and Mush there were minor
local engagements. Enemy attacks
against our advanced positions, form
ing a salient toward the northeast in
the sector of Agnott, which was de
fended by a small force, proceeded
over a period of five days with seven
regiments of infantry, four regiments
of cavalry and more -than thirty guns
and howitzers, but were bloodily re
pulsed. During the battle the enemy
lost more than 3,000 men killed. Our
losses were very small in comparison.
"Tuesday morning the enemy at
tacked with fresh reinforcements,
after seven hours of artillery pre
paration. but again suffered extraor
dinary losses. Our advanced detach
ment was withdrawn to positions a
little in the rear as their presence in
the old position was considered use
less.
"In the center and on the left wing
on the coast there was no important
fighting. Enemy activity was directed
especially to an advance westward
from Ereingan which was completely
unsuccessful. The enemy occupied
Kala Bums west of Polathane. A
Russian aeroplane was shot down on
the coast of the Black sea and the
occupants were captured.
"On July 80, under the protection
of enemy war vessels, about 500 bri
gands in various disguises landed on
the coast of Depi Burnu, east of the
island of Samos. Owing to our resist
ance and attacks they were unable to
advance and had to retreat to their
landing place, suffering losses in dead
and wounded.
"In the direction northwest of
Katia (25 miles east of the Sues
canal) airmen dropped bombs suc
cessfully and attacked with machine
guns the British positions encamped
near Muhammadiya on the coast and
south of that place.
"Two days ago a cruiser and an
armed transport vessel entered the
gulf of Akaba (northern arm of the
Red sea) and bombarded Akaba
the surrounding territory. An attempt
to land troops fslled, owing to our
fire. The enemy loss was serious."
