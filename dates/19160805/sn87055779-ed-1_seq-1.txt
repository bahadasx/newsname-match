An engineer and liremen were instantly killed, several passengers
slightly injured and a trainload of persons escaped unscratched
when the boiler of a Lake trie and Western locomotive exploded
near Kuple's pit seven miles southwest of South Bend at 10:20
o'clock Friday night.
The accident occurred just as the train, composed of two coach
es, a baggage car and engine, was passing over a stretch of road
bed being -repaired by a section gang. With a crash that could be
heard for half a mile" the big boiler suddenly exploded, causing the
locomotive to dive from the tracks through a wooden section
shanty, to plow head foremost into a large excavation and to turn
completely over.
Following the engine, the baggage car jumped the tracks and
buried its front end in the marsh on the side of the roadbed oppo
site that on which the locomotive was embedded. One skle of the
car was tipped at a degree angle causing its contents to slide out
from the open door.
It will probably never he known
now the explosion occurred or what
i a used it. The engineer ;oid fire
man were the only persons in the
tab airi both were killed.

feet. The bell and one of the steam
domes were Ijing close to the tracks,
having been ripped away by the
force of the explosion. Scraps of
metal were strewn for jards around
and in the boiler of the engine was
n large ragged hole where the rush
i r g steam had forced its way
through.

ii tcrnational News Service:
DKTIIOIT. Mich., Aug. 5 The
biggest man hunt of the year is on
in Detroit and vicinity. Although
7." detectives and policemen and 25
deputies have combed the south
eastern part of the state in an un
relenting search for the automobile
bandits who held up the pay car of
the Burroughs Adding Machine Co.,
making away with $32.500, after
shooting Rudolph Cooper, a Bur
roughs guard, no definite clue has
been found and not an arrest has
Vvfc'Cn made up to 11 o'clock this

The police today say that the job
was evidently the work of experts
and intimate strongly that in view
of the perfectly flawless way in
which it was worked it was appar

NKW YORK, Aug. 3. The strike
of street car employes which was
called by the union leaders last
night is in full swing tolay on many

ously crippled. The few cars run
ning on the affected lines are under
heavy guard.

management to remain loyal. With
their walkout tho total of men on

ever, except for sporadic outbursts
that occurred at points distant from
tho places where the police were

that the lints under his management
would continue to operate.
"Practically all our cars are leav
ing on scheduio time," he said,

east Fide, because of lack of police
protection. There was no protec
tion until 2:30 o'clock this morning.
A nunrber of our men became
frightened and left the barns. That

now have full police protection.
There is a policeman for each car."
