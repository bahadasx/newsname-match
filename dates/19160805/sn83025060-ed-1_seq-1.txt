"JOKING AT CAllKIKAh."
"For forty-five minutes the men
fought, joking among themselves uu
the while, even when they realized
we hud boon trapped and had little
chance of getting out alive." So Capt
Morey describes the conduct of his
troopers at Cartful, in the most se
rious predicament that any body of
American soldiers has been in slnco
tho Spanish war.
In tingle extremity, thoBe men in
khaki were true to tho American tra
dition. It was not that they fought
bravely any race can do that, even
Mexican. Hut they fought with
smiles on their lips and burst into
Bong while the lead sprayed around
them from Mexican machine guns and
enoimouBly superior enemy forces
charged their thin, unprotected line.
That was characteristic. The Ameri
can n fuses to take danger seriously.
He may be glum enough over triiles,
but when real tragedy comes ho sheds
it as a cluck sheds water, and ho
faces death with a grin.
These men were Negroes, too. In
fact, nearly all the American troops
that hae been inked up in berlous
lighting In Mexico so far havo been
Negroes. And from tho reports of
their behavior, nobody would ever
think of raising tho color question.
They acted just as we should have ex
pected white Americans to act.
