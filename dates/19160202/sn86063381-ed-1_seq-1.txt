PRESIDENT SPEAKS
AT DES MOINES
Asks if the People Are Satisfied to
Have Him Able Only to Write
Notes to Lawbreakers.
Des Moines, la., Feb. 2."Do you
want the situation to be such that all
the president can do is to write mes
sages and utter words of protest?"
asked President Wilson here last
night in advocating preparedness be
fore the largest audience of his pres
ent trip.
"Why, to ask that question is to
answer it," he said.
Law Violated.
"Whenever international law is
violated by one or the other belliger-
ents," the president said, "America
is called upon to register a voice of
protest of insistence.
"Do you want the situation to be
such that all the president can do is
to write messages and utter words of
protest? If these breaches of inter
national law which are in daily dan
ger of occurring should touch the
very honor of the United States, do
you wish to do nothing about it? Do
you wish to have all the world say
that the flag of the United States that
we have can be stained with impuni
ty? Why, to ask that question is to
answer it.
Not Peace at Any Price.
"I know there is not a man or
woman within the hearing of my
voice who would wish peace at the
expense of the honor of the United
States."

Cleveland, O., 2.Be-
cause of the high price of
gasoline here20 to 22 cents
per gallon, retailmany own
ers of automobiles are stor
ing their cars. Some have not
taken out their 1916 licen
ses, dealers and garage men
say. Tires and tubings have
also cost more. The increased
cost of gasoline is explained -fc
by dealers here as due to the
fact that but one-sixteenth
more crude oil was produced
in 1915 than in 1914, while
27 per cent more internal
motive power was in opera
tion. However, government
reports show that there is -fc
-K more crude oil above ground
now than ever before.

CITY ASSOCIATIONS
CONSIDER MERGER
The Bemidji Commercial club and
Business Men's association may be
merged into one organization. This
was discussed at a meeting of the

and that with a budget system the
new organization would be able to
accomplish more than do the asso
ciations now.
A joint committee will be appoint
ed by the two associations to meet
with the directors of the two asso
ciations and formulate plans.

ATTORNEY SAYS LIFE OF
TREATY ONLY 60 YEARS
Mayor Power Confident Saloons Will
Reopen Will Affect Bemidji
If True.
Hibbing, Minn., Feb. 2.That the
life of the Indian treaty of 1855,
which caused the saloons of Hibbing,
Chisholm and other Western Mesaba
Range points and Bemidji and sur
rounding country to close, expires
Feb. 14, is a statement of Hibbing
liquor dealers who are confident that
they will be able to reopen-their sa
loons next month. They claim the
treaty's life is for 60 years.
Money Wagered.
Money is being wagered at Hib
bing, Dulth and other points that
the saloons that have been closed
will be allowed to reopen in Febru
ary. A number of the former lead
ing saloonkeepers of the Western
Mesaba range are keeping their
stocks of liquor intact and seem to
he confident they will be allowed to
reopen their places of business.
Mayor is Confident.
Mayor Victor L. Power, of Hib
bing, of counsel for the liquor deal
ers, is confident that the former deal
ers will again be dispensing drinks.
Attorney P. C. Schmidt of the Fit
ger Brewing company, recently made
a trip to Washington and it is be
lieved he unearthed some valuable
information for the liquor cause.
Interest Aroused.
Congressmen have been interview
ed by attorneys representing the
Western Mesaba Range liquor deal
ers. One argument that has been
used by the attorneys is that the sa
loons have been allowed to do busi
ness for 20 years, despite the treaty.
The latest bit of information that
the saloons may reopen has aroused
jnucl^in^terest. If the former sa
loons do business again a blow will
have been struck at county option in
this section of the state.
If the attorneys for the liquor in
terests can prove that the life of the
treaty expires this month, saloons in
Bemidji will probably be reopened.

Matter in Infancy.
"The matter is still in its in

talk. We do, however, expect to getincluding
the members of the school boards of
the other districts together in the
near future and take some action
in regard to the matter.
Action Necessary.
"Action of some kind is necessary.
We believe that the three districts

NOVEL PROBLEM
State Department Investigates Situa
tion Prisoners May Be
Released.
IF DECLARED PRIZE
MATTER MORE COMPLEX
Next Lusitania Move is Up to United
States, Says Berlin
Dispatch.
Washington, Feb. 2.Until it is
decided whether the German com
mander aboard the British steamer
Appam brought the ship to an Amer
ican port as a prize or as a converted
auxiliary cruiser of the German navy,
there will be no determination of the
American government's course re
specting the ship.
Release Prisoners.
When certain formalities have been
complied with, the ship's passengers,
several British colonial of
ficials, will be released and their dis
position passed on by immigration au
thorities. Any prisoners of war will
be released, because international law
permits of no holding of war pris
oners in a neutral country.
To Intern Officers.
The United States, then, finally
will have to deal with the German
crew under Lieut. Berge, and if they
are accounted in the navy service of
Germany, as were the crews of the
Prinz Eitel Frederich and the Kron
Prinz Wilhelm, already interned at
the Norfolk navy yards, they, too,
will be interned unless the ship goes
to sea to run the cordon of British
cruisers outside.
New Problem.
As to the disposition of the Appam
herself, if she is held to be an auxili
ary cruiser, the commander will have
the option of putting to sea after a
certain time to make repairs and take
provisions. And if she is declared a
prize the situation becomes more
complex, and in that event it Is ad
mitted that the United States will
have to deal with probably the most
novel question concerning its neut
rality that has arisen during tlie watv
As one of the first steps that prob
lem probably would be referred to
the neutrality board. The board's
findings, while merely advisory, have
weight with the state department.
Up to President.
Berlin, Feb. 2.It was semi-offl
cially stated that President Wilson
must make the next move in the Lusi
tania deadlock solution. German
American controversy depends upon
his action.
Was Not Attacked.
London, Feb. 2.Newspapers to
day charge that the Zeppelins' raid
Monday was ineffective. It was de
nied that Liverpool was attacked as
was reported in Berlin.
MOTHERS TO MEET

There will be a meeting of the
mothers of the girls of the high

Four liquor licenses were granted

Olson and Frank Arnold. The vote
for licenses was unanimous. All

cilman Hermanson.

GROUND HOG SEES
SHADOW MORE GOLD
Last evening Mr. Ground Hog was
snugly resting in bis hole in the
ground. This morning, however, he
opened his eyes, stretched himself
and went out into the open for a
look around. He saw his shadow,
concluded that the worst of the win
ter was not over, and went back for
another six weeks' sleep:
Today is Ground Hog today and
according to popular superstition is
a barometer for the remainder of the
winter. The Ground Hog, seeing his
shadow today, means that there will
be six more weeks of winter weather.
