President Wilson told Kansas.
President Wilson handed the
challenge to his crowd of Kan

with an outburst of enthusiasm
that put a new aspect on the re

Wilson program.
President Wilson spent forty

i avenue. Not a serious blunder marred
the si-and pagpant planned for weeks
i bv Topeka as proper for the president
and his bride.
From the Santa Fe depot to the
I end of the parade it was a continual
series of instrumental music from
three uniformed bands slitter of ri-
fles and uniforms of militiamen on
i foot. Mounted police in uniforms,
! mounted members of the government

cheer broke forth, one of the bands
struck ii another popular air and To
pekans again went wild with patriotic
enthusiasm of true Americans.
Train in on Time.
Promptly at 10 o'clock the presiden-
tial train rolled into the Santa Fe
station. In the front car newspaper
men, photographers and telegraphers
spranar to the ground and ran for
waiting automobiles. A line of militia
kept the brick paving of -he platform
clear of curious.
But the center of attraction as the
rear car. Governor Capper. Mayor
House, W. W. Webb, president f the
Commercial club, and F. K. Whitney
mounted the steps of the car and in a
few minutes were seen coming out.
The president and Mrs. Wilson fol
lowed. A telegram was received short
ly before the rain's arrival requesting
that the reception committee remain
seated in their machines and the order
was carried out to the tetter.
I'nattendsd. excepting by secret
service men who remained at their el
bows continually. President and Mrs.
Wilson stepped from the car and rap
idly made their way to a waiting auto
mobile. Cheer after cheer was given
as they walked to the machine. Pres

coat wnile his h"ide wore a big. black

gloves.

with a line of conversation. About
i half an hour previous the sun ap-
air. vem remarked on the sun s ap-j
pearance on groundhog day. i
Yes. replied the president. "That
animal seems determined to give us
a long winter."
Tipped Hat to Cooks.
Just then two female cooks in short
in an upper room of the Harvev house
began al.t .iting and waving their
hands at the nresident arr hie- u
! Both looked up. the president tipped
his hat. Mrs. Wilson bowed and both
laugnea as tne two women clapped
their hands with glee at their success
n attracting the attention of Topeka s
uests.
Secret service men stood on both
sides of the president and his wife and
marched beside his car in the parade.
A third rode in the car. One seemed
abstracted for a minute. The chief
rushed up, grasping him by the arm
and said:
"Watch that crowd back there.
We've got to stay here five or ten
minutes.'
Men had climbed on top of the
porch over the platform, the second
story of the depot ws filled with
eager faces and on every side cheers
were given as the au omobile drove
away.

The shrewd Tumulty managed the af
fair for President Wilson and finally
consented to receive a resolution for

per home shortly before 1 o'clock by
a delegation of about twenty club
women.
This was done. Mrs. 1-illa Day Mon

women marched up to the door, bowed
to the smiling president and his diplo

resolutions, was thanked for the same

While the monstrous parade wound
its way up Kansas Avenue and around
the state house square, the women be- j

secretary, refused to play the "bull in

inner room appearing only when the
I telephone rang. After the parade had
appeared in the state house and played
several selections which added a pret
ty feature to this meeting of the club
women which can't help but become
more or less historic.
Probably seventy-five suffragettes
assembled. Tome carried children in

nresided and addressed the crowd and
at the same time carried on negotia

The only business in hand today in
Topeka is listening to the President
of the United States and watching his
wife. The president made the speeches
and smilingly acknowledged the plau
dits, but everyone knows it was the
White House bride that the town
"came out for to see." It is a well
known fact that President Woodrow
Wilson does not feel so dreadfully bad
about his looks; for all America re
members his own words in a limerick
in which he acknowledged that he
was not a star of bexuty, "But my face
I ion't mind it; for I am behind it.
The people in front g?t the jar." I
say, all America knowa that; but all
the world knows that Mrs. Wilson
loves orchids.
