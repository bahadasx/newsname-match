Washington Hears
Moewe, but a Recently Built
Ship Which Raided British
Shipping Off Africa.
r WASHINGTON Feb. 2 Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British Am
bassador, to-day formally asked Secretary Lansing for the release of the
fcppam and its return to the British owners, under Article 21 of the Hague
Convention, which the BritWi authorities claim has superceded the
Prussian-American treaty. The Secretary took the Ambassador's argu
ment under consideration.
If the State Department decides the Appam is not a German auxiliar.
ind" interned, high-officials declared this Government will, answer ling
land's demands with an order placing the Appam in prize court.
Rear Admiral Beatty, commanding the Norfolk Navy Yard, has re
ported tliat Lieut. Berg claims the ship as a prize of war. The German
Embassy has not yet determined whether it will claim the Appam is an
auxiliary cruiser or a prke.
Stato Dopnrtmont officials indicated
to-day that It the Appam finally Is I
Jield to bo a prlio, tho Prussian-1
American treaty of 1828 Is more llltoly
to govern the case than is Tno Hague
Convention. This would moan that
bo Appam would bo turnod over to
tier German captors, and In that caso
porno Gorman ofllclals expressed the
View that tho prlzo crow, rather than
let her fall back into the hands of
Itho British, as would soem Inevitable
t she left port, might tako the ship
o tho threo mllo limit and sink her.

tiliary.

TOPKKA. Ks.. Feb. 2. Declaring
that this country may be called upon
to preserve tho personal and business

'America has the right to feed the

blockade; where there are ordinary
restraints of war. wo recognize thorn:
but tho world needs the wheat from i
the wheat fields of Kansas. ,
'And tho traveling of Americans." ,
he added, "ought not to bo Impeded j

President and Mrs. Wilson reached,

As the President stepped up to speak
Gov. Capper advanced to meet him
nnd as the two shook hands hundreds
of American flags fluttered down
from the top of the hall, released from
small holes In tho celling.
"You will realize that It l because
I have felt it my Imperative duty to
como hero from Washington to assist
In clarifying Judgment and sweep
away those things Irrelevant and tin-
truo, which are likely to cloud the

you to understand that cvory day Is
critical while this great conflict
across tho water endures.
"America Is a composite nation.
You don't feel it out here so much,
for you are all natlvo born. But In

Intimate sympathies aro with some
of the places now affected by this
titanic struggle. Tho majority of

If sometimes their feollngs aro stirred
by this war.
"A vast majority of tliem, how
over, have the paaslon of America the
same as you and I. Some of thorn,

but, my friends, there are some men

of fire. It has been our constant ef
fort to sro that those sparks do not
touch tho magazines.
"I whs told, and actually read to
day, that Kansas was not In favor
of any policy of national defense,"
the President said. "I don't believe
It. If I were to pick out any place
that "would get hot first at any In
fringement upon the polioics of
