COURT DISPOSES
OF MAKY CASES
Case of Henry Frahm v« Peter Eggers
Decided In Favor of Plaintiff—
Verdict for $497.70.
SOPER-FINNERAN CASE CONTIN'D
Case of Chas. Johnson vs City of Den
ison Now on—Suit for Value of
Bull That Fell in Ditch
District court is still grinding away
on jury work and a large amount of
business is* being disposed of during
the term. A week ago, when the pa
per came out, the case of Peter'Frahm
vs Peter Eggers was on trial. This
case lasted until the latter part of the
week, when a verdict was returned in
favor of the plaintiff for $497.70. A
motion for a new trial has been filed,
which is now pending. The contention
is that the verdict arrived at was il
legal because it is what is known as a
quotient verdict. The' motion will be
heard and disposed of, in all proba
bility, before this term of court ad
journs.
The case of Soper vs Finneran,
which was specially assigned for
Tuesday morning, was later continued
over the term by agreement. This
brought on for trial the case of All
stot vs Robertson, a case arising in
the vicinity of Manilla The case is
being tried before a jury and will prob
ably be disposed of some time today.
Another case now on trial is that
of Johngon vs the City of Denison, A.
J. Gary et al, sureties on Mr. Gary's
bend. This case was brought by Mr.
Johnson to recover the value of a bull
which fell into a sewer ditch which
was under construction down on Rail
road avenue, a short distance east of
Locust street. The case will probably
occupy'a day or two in its trial.
There are several other cases await
ing the action of the court and the
probabilities are that the full ter
will be taken up in disposing of them
and that a portion of the cases now
assigned for trial will have to go over
the term.. At the rate at which busi
ness is being dispatched at this term
it should not take a great while to
clear the docket of trial cases.
Thos. Nielsen, who was called to
Box Elder, Mont., last week, returned
home Saturday. Mr. Nielsen state?
that his sons, Ever and Albert, had a
big deal on and wished to consult with
their father before closing it up. He

THE DENISON REVIEW
THIS WEEK'S NEWS THIS WEEK, NOT NEXT WEEK.
DENISON, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, FEB. 2, 1916.
DENISON WINS TWO.
High School Basketball Team Wins
Two Important Games—Defeat
Vail and Correctionville.
The local high school basketball
team won two important games last
week and high school students are
elated with the fine showing which the
team is making.
The first game was played Friday
evening with Vail's fast team and this
proved to be one of the most exciting
exhibitions of basketball ever witness
ed in Denison. Vail has a very fast
team and it was nip and tuck from
start to finish between the two teams.
When the points were totaled up it
was found that Denison was victor by
a close margin of 29 to 24. It was a
clean game throughout and both team?
exhibited some classy "playing. The
Denison college team played the Ma
nilla high school team just prior to
this game and Manilla came out ahead
by the score of 22 to 18. These teams
were well matched and showed good
form.
Saturday night a game was played
with Correctionville, which resulted
in another victory for the local tear"
the score being 53 to IS. Correction
ville was simply outclassed and not
once was Denison in danger of losing
the game. As a curtain rai3er to this
game a team made up from the Deni
son grades played a team of Vail boys,
the game resulting in a victory for the
Vail boys by a score-of 16 to 13.
Two games are scheduled for this
week. Friday evening the high school
team goes to Jefferson and on Satur
day they will play the fast team from
Perrv at Denison. Oscar Strahan is
coaching the Perry tdam and it is ex
pectPd that Denison will endeavor to
win this game and even up scores for
the defeat which they met two weeks
ago at Perry's hands.
Mrs. Peter Langholtz underwent a
major
operation at the Denison hospi
tal Mondiv. The operation was suc
cessful and the oatient is reported to
uary 31st. Mr. Vassar spent most of
the day up town receiving congratula
tions from his many friends. Notwith
standing his advanced age, Jlr.,Vassar
enjoys good health and is able to be
up town every day and is a familiar
figure at the post office, where he ac
commodates people by selling stamps
when the windows .are closed. His
many friends hope that he lives to cel
ebrate many more birthdays.
The women's bible study classes of
the city will meet at 2:30 o'clock on
Tuesday afternoon with Mesdames J.
H. Hayes. E. P. Sievers. Frank Bol
ton. R. B. Thomnson, George Davis

Hon. Z. T. Nixon died at his home
in Corsica last Thursday afternoon,
Jan. 20, 1!)1G, a^ter a lingering ill
ness of almost two years' duration.
About thirty years ago Mr. Nixon suf
fered a severe attack of pneumonia
which left him very weak and for some
time his life was despaired of during
the sickness. After this sickness Ik?
was left with a bad cough and any lit
tle cold/ that he would take would
greatly irritate this. About two years
ago when he was at Rochester, Minn.,
From Crawford county Mr. Nixon
and family moved to Douglas county

The business was kept up until a few,
months ago when Mr. Nixon and son

has been practically an invalid and al
though everything possible that lov

done, he did not improve in health, but
kept getting weaker.

educational and political affairs in
the community in which he liyed and
faithfully served on school ana town
ship boards and for two terms (1911

TRIBULATIONS OF
TWO PARTNERS
"Potash & Perl mutter," a Rare Combi
nation of Humor, Pathos and
Characterization Next Thursday
ARE ENGAOED IN SUIT TRADE
Made Famous by Stories Published in
Saturday Evening Post, Written
by Montague Glass.
That rare combination of humor,
pathos and characterization grouped
under the name of "Potash & Perlmut
ter" will reach Denison on Thursday,
February 10th, for an engagement of
"one night at the Germania opera
house.
The story as recalled is not only full
of delicious humor, but it has a charm
ing love story running through it and
the side bits of characterization with
which it is crowded make it a neter
ending fund of delight.
Briefly the story of "Potash & Perl
mutter" deals with the trial and tribu
lations of these two partners of the
cloak and suit trade through their gen
erous championship of Boris Andrieffl
a young Russian, whom the represent
atives of the czar are trying to drag
back to the country of his birth anil
to a lifetime.in Siberia. They pledge
their all to go his bail and when,
through their ignorance of the law, he
starts for Canada to gain a respite
from the trickery of the Russian rep
resentatives, and the partners are in
clanger of forfeiting their business and
their homes, the story takes a serious
turn indeed.
But Boris learns through the news
papers of the danger of his benefac
tors and returns in time to save them
from ruin and to learn of his complete
vindication. There is plenty of ro
mance to add to the charm of the play,
for Boris marries "Abe's" young
daughter, while Perlmutter wins a
"lady designer" with a business head
like Carnegie and a shape like Lillian
Russell—a young lady by the way who
figures extensively in the food for
tunes of the re-established firm.
Reserved seats for this attraction
will be placed on sale at the Sclilum
berger drug store next Monday. Make
your reservations early.
The show Saturday evening, "A Pair
of Sixes." was one of the best farces
ever presented in Denison. The play
was full of action and was full of fun
ny situations which kept the audience
in an uproar all evening. The acting
was particularly good and the two
leading men were better than the av
erage.
One Lot of Dress Goods. All wool serge, 54
inch width. Formerly retailed at $1.89 a yard.

day, Friday and Saturday of this week only.
