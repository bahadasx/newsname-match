school for the feebleminded has been
introduced in the senate by Senator
Sherared of Amierson and Senator
Christensen of Beaufort. The bill
provides for the appointment of five
trustes, who, in co-operation with the
voard of charities and corrections, are
to make a preliminary survey of the
state, to select a site. determi~ne upon
the nature and number of buildings
necessary, the cost of equipment and
maintenance through 1917. and report
to the legislature next session.
A bill to givt - oployes a prior lien
on their employer in certain cases.
or giving them the same rights as
they have under the bankruptcy laws
of the United States, was passed in
the house.
An amendment to the house rules
adopted provildes that on each legis
lative day .'0 minutes. if so much be
necessary, shall be set aside before
special and general orders for the
consideration of unconteste~d local
bills. This will enable the calendar
to be !Cenced materially and will allow
local and county measures to go for
ward at rapid rate.
Sayings for the Sheepowner.
Good lambs are money makers.
Speculation and uncertainty of tar
1f tinkering have been the bane of
the sheep industry.
Keep dogs and strangers out of
sight of the flock.
Lambs will make a great growth on
clover and alfalfa hay and corn.
The ability of the ewe to properly
nouish her lamb is one of the most
important considcrations in selecting
Liles Bill In Senate.
Debate in the senate was confined
exclusively for one day to the Liles
bill from the house, designed to put
"teeth" in the prohibition law, by im
posing chaingang or prison sentence
for violation, without the alternative
of a fine. Considerable devision ex
ists in the senate over the measure.
The consensus of opinion at this time
favors the passage of the bill in its
original form.
The Liles bill as brought over from
the house provides that a prison or
chaingang sentence of not less than
six months nor more than two years
shall be imposed for the first viola
tion. Subsequent offenses carry with
them minimum sentence of one year
and mavimum of five years. The cir
cuit judge in his discretion may sus
pend all of the prison sentence for
the first offense but 30 days and 01
subsequent offenses all but 60 days,
"upon such terms and conditions as
he may see fit to impose." The Laney
amendment provides the alternative of
a fine of not less than $100 nor more
than $1,000 for the first offense.
For Uniform Road Building.
The advisibility of creating a state
highway commission with a license
on automobiles for its maintenance
was both championed and disapprov
ed on the floor of the house tn a de
bate which on motion was adjourned.
The principal object of such a com
mission as outlined in the bill propos
ed by the house committee on roads,
bridges and ferries, is to co-operate
with the road authorities of various
counties and to study the system of
public highways and road construc
tion, It was urged in behalf of a com
mission that there should be one body
with supervisory and advisory powers
over the large amount of money ex
pended by the counties of the state
during the course of a year in road
work, the aggregate being about $1,
600,000.
No Party to Agreement.
W. M. Riggs, president of Clemson
college, authorized the following
statement: "Neither Clemson college
nor its-president is a party to any
agrement or understanding to oppose
or support any scholarship or free
tuition measures pending before the
legislature. I am not aware of any
concerted action to be taken by state
college presidents."
For New Circuit.
After a long debate, in which op
position gained much strength, the
house refused to recommit the bill
providing for a Fourteenth judicial
district, composed of the counties of
Hampton, Colleton, Jasper and Beau
fort, by a yea and nay vote of 53 to
50. The bill was later given a third
reading and sent to the senate by a
vote of 58 to 44.
No State Printing Plant.
Constitutional objections exclude
from consideration the project. of a
state printing plant, according to the
special committee from the house of
representatives, which in co-operation
with a similar body from the senate
has been investigating the public
printing problem during the last year.
The house committee is composed of
Representatives W. R. Bradford of
York, chairman; L. L. Wagnon of
Union and W. W. Harris, of Laurens.
Article 17, section 5, constitution
of 1895, says: "The printing of the
laws, journals, bills, legislative docu
ments and papers for each branch of
the general assembly, with the print
ing required for the executive and
other departments of the state, shall
be let on contract in such manner as
shall be prescribed by law."
House and senate bills are printed
n 12 poInt (pica), with a pica of
white space between the lines. The
committee recommends that they be
printed in 10 point (long primer), that
the space between the lines be re
duced to 6 points (nonpareil) and that
the length of the line be reduced from
36 to 30 ems, so that linotype compo
sition may be facilitated; it Is also
pointed out that the eye more easily
takes in the shorter line.
"The committee considered at
Length the printing of stationery (let
terheads, envelopes, tally sheets, roll
calls. etc.) annually done for the
general assembly," says the report.
"The cost of this printing is in the
aggregate considerable- Much of it
now s inferior in workmanship and
one on a poor quality of paper,.
though the charge for all of it has'
been high enough to warrant the ex
pectation that first class printing on
flrst class stock would be secured.
"All of thfs printing should be in
luded in one or more contracts, to be
awarded to the lowet responsible
bidder, Instead of going to perhaps a
ozen or more printers, as is now the
practice. Uniformity, better prices,
better material and better workman
ship would be secured if this work
were let by contract-"
Mr. Smith's house bill to increase
the salaries of state officers was kill
d in the house by the decisive ma
jority of 65 to 24. The bill had re
~eeved a majority unifavorable report
rrom the ways and means committee,.
although its provisions were not to
bcome effective until after the expir.r
ton of the terr- of the Incumbents.
The house passed without discussion
a resolution introduced by Messrs.
Beckett and Fripp of Beaufort indors
ng the policy of national preparedness
is outlined by President Wilson and
.lling upon the South Carolina dele
lation to further such a policy.
The report of the legislative com
nittee, consisting of Senator Hughes,

he supreme court reports, contained a

AMERICA IS NOT
AFRAI OF ANYBODY
PRESIDENT IS ONLY AFRAID OF
NOT BEING READY TO DO
DUTY.
HE SOLEMNLY WARNS NATION
Time May Come When He Cannol
Keep United States Out of War
and Maintain Honor.
Cleveland, Ohio.-President Wilson,
speaking as he said "solemnly," warn
de the nation that the time may come
when he cannot both keep the United
States out of war and maintain its
honor. He declared that the country
must be prepared to defend itself and
prepared at once.
"America is not afraid of anybody,'
he said. "I know I reflect your feel.
ing and the feeling of all our citizens
when I say the only thing I am
afraid of is not being ready to per
form my duty. I am afraid of the
danger of inadequacy; I am afraid of
the danger of not being able to express
the chief character of this country
with tremendous might and effective
ness whenever we are called upon to
act in the field of the world's affairs."
"Let me tell you very solmenly' you
cannot postpone this thing," he de
clared. "I do not know what a sin
gle day may bring forth. I do not
wish to leave you with the impression
that I am thinking of some partciular
danger.
"I merely wish to tell you that we
are daily treading amidst i ticae
dangers. The dangers .that we are
treading amongst are not of our own
making and not under our control. I
think no man in the United States
knows what a single week, a single
day may bring for them."
Pittsburg.-President Wilson open
ed his six-day speaking tour of the
Middle West by addressing an audi
ence of more than 4,000 that pack
ed Memorial Hall here, later appear
ing before an overflow meeting where
his hearers were -mostly womeI. In.
both addresses he set forth the need
for a program of national. defense and
at the larger meeting said that the
test of national preparedness lay not
with congress, but with the young men
of the country in their answer to the
call to volunteer and their employers
who should oppose no obstacle to free
response.
He believed, he added, that both
the young men and the employers
will do their duty and that he was not
afraid America -will not do enough.
FLOOD SWEEPS OTAY VALLEY.
Repeated Floods Drowned Over 100.
Big Property Loss.
San Diego, Cal., by wireless to San
Francisco.-One hundred lives have
been lost, as nearly as any estimate
can show, and charming little valleys
for 50* miles north of the Mexican
line lie desolate from floods and~
cloudbursts.
With the death toll In the Otay Vol
ley seeming established at 50 and all
relief agencies working in that direc
tion, reports reached here of floods
sweeping the San Luis Roy and San
Pasquel Valleys, doubling the loss of
Looting, described by Rear Admiral:
Fullam, commanding the Pacific re
serve fleet, as "The worst I have ever
seen.' broke out in the Otay Valley,
flood swept by the breaking of the
Otay dam. The lower valley was
turned into an armed camp patrolled
by marines and sailors from the bat
tieship Oregon and the cruisers Mil
waukee and South Dakota in San
Diego Bay with orders to shoot loot-;
ers on sight.
The sailors and maarines toiled hard
to recover the bodies of those who;
lost their lives in the disaster and at
sundown 29 bodies, some of which
were mutilated had been gathered to
gether.
A new flood poured down the Tia
Juana River which has risen four
feet at its mouth at the foot of San
Diego May. Officials here said that
this undoubtedly indicated the burst-*
ing of the Morena dam, 60 miles back
in the hills.
Zeppelin Raids Paris.
Paris.-A Zeppelin dirigible passed
swiftly over a section of Paris drop
ping about a dozen great bombs.
which killed 24 persons and injured
27. Warnings were given again
shortly before 10 o'clock and a sec
ond air attack was momentarily ex
pected by the residents of the dark
ened city. The fact that only one
German miachine appeared leads to the
belief that the Zeppelin was making
a reconnoitering trip and the'supposi-.
tion is that the Germans have in view
a similar operation on a larger scale.
Mann Defends President.
Washington. - Republican Leader
Mann came to the .defense of Presi
dent Wilson in the house when Repre
sentative Dies of Texas, leader of the
anti-preparedness Democrats, attack
ed the president's New York speech
on national preparedness. Mr. Mann
rebuked Mr. Dies for making any re
marks about the president's views be

only defrnse for changing his position

he was right.

WILSON NOMINATES
LOUIS 0.BRANEIS
TO SUCCESS THE LATE JUSTIGC
LAMAR ON SUPREME COURT
BENCH.
WAS A COMPLETE SURPRISE
Senate and All Official Washingter
Received News Without Fore
warning.
Washington.-Louis D. Brandeis of
Boston was nominated by President
Wilson- for the place on' the Supreme
Court bench made vacant by the death
of Associate Justice Lamar.
The Senate received the nomina,
-tion with unconcealed surprise-it
which all official Washington joined,
because Mr. Brandeis had not been
mentioned among the long list of
eligibles which President Wilson con
sidered, or among an equally long
list of aspirants who presented en
dorsements.
Some Senators announced to their
colleagues they were opposed to the
nomination, but declined to be quot
ed to thatkeffect. The only Senator
found who''was willing to 'publicly
record his opposition at this time was
Senator Wadsworth, Republican, of
New: York.
Senators who aproved the nomina
tion were not lacking, although they,
too, avoided, public expression of their
views. They felt sure however they
could command the necessary major.
ity to confirm the appointment.
'It was learned that among the en
dorsements sent to the President urg
ing Mr. Brandeis' appointment was
one from Gifford Pinchot, former chief
forestor, whose celebrated controversy
with Secretary Ballinger brought Mr.
Brandeis into the public eye six years
ago. He appeared as chief counsel for
the forces opposing the former Secre
tary of the Interior in the noted Bal
linger-Pinchot controversy which sent
its ramifications into many phases of
national politics at the outset of Pres
ident Taft's administration.
Although celebrated as a lawyer,
Mr. Brandeis has been devoting pra. -
tcally all his time of late to the Zion.
fat movement In this country which
14s for its object, the repatriation of
the Jews to a nation of their owp..4n
. aie tie.' .
- Some.of the Senators disposed
express opposition to Mr. Brandeis
were Democrats who sought to put
their objections on political grounds.
Senator James of Kentucky, the native
state of Mr. Brandeis, unreservedly
told them the nominee was a Demo
crat. Justice Lamar, whom he would
succeed, also was a Democrat. Six of
the eight Justices now on the bench
are Republicans!
FORCE TO PROTECT COAST.
Colonel Haan Says $1,025,000 Men
Necessary to Protect Coast.
Washington.--Why a force of at
least 1.025,000 men would be needed
to protect the "vital areas" of the U~ni
ted' States against a strong enemy
was detailed to the senate military
committee by Lieut. Col. W. G. Haan,
a member of the war department
bard which spent several years work
ing out defense laws.
The board, known as the National
Land Defense Board, and of which
Major General Witherspoon~ was pres
ident, visited and studied minutely
every part of the coast line. It report.
ed In 1913, but Its findings have been
held confidential by the department.
Among other information It submitted
detailed working plans drawn up in
cojunction with the engineer corps
fo.meeting emergencies. Col. Haan
dsome of these plans now were be
'g used in revising defenses of metro.
politan districts in accordance with
latest information as to the range of
foreign field artillery and ships' guns.
- First Appropriation Bill.
Washington.-The first of the an
nual appropriation bills-the urgent i
deficiency bill-was reported to the<
senate. An increase of $948,000 was I
made by the finance committee to the1
$12,500,000 contained in the bill as it
came from the house.
President Starts on Tour.
Wiashington.-Presidenlt Wilson left
Washington for a speaking tour in
the Middle WVest in advocacy of his
preparedness program. He has been
told that most of the opposition to the
army and navy increases is centeredt
in that section of the country and be- (
lieves that success of his defense plans
depends in large measure on the im-a
pression he makes. He will remain(
away from Washington until Febru
uary 4. The president will go over
the army and navy programs minute.
ly and touch on other questions.
Preparing For Field Days.
Orangeburg.-Programmes are now
being prepared for school field days
ad also the great final county field:
ay to be held at Orangreburg some
time the last of March. gl'hese field
ay occasions are justly becomning
ery popular in the county and are do-.I
ag a great deal to encour-age better
reading, spelling, arithmetic, wr-itir~-,

DAIRY HERD IN WINTER
First Essential Is That Cows Be
Kept Comfortable.
Right Kind of Feed Goes Long Way
Toward Bringing About Contented
State of Mind-Several Im
portant Factors.
(By W. M. KELLY.)
Good stable management Is an im
3ortant factor in determining the
profits from the dairy herd during the
winter. The first essential is that the
:ows be comfortable, because a cow
cept otherwise can never do her best.
She must have a comfortable place
o lie down, stand up, move and
stretch her limbs and lick herself all
>ver the body. She must have sun
;hine and plenty of light. She must
ave pure air to breathe, and this
neans that the stable must be pro
rided with some system of ventila
ion to give a frequent change of air.
This need not be expensive, only a
ittle forethought and a few dollars'
worth of material and labor. She
nust have good pure water at least
;wice a day, or better still, have an
automatic water basin at her side..
The stable should be cleaned daily,
md be thoroughly disinfected. The
veiling, flooir and sides should be all
;mooth and of concrete construction,
md the fixtures largely iron. It is not
expensive, and they are sanitary and.
,ermanent.
Large, smooth concrete mangers for
eeding are about the best we know
>f today, Judgment and common
ense must be exercised in the meth
:ds of feeding and handling jhe cows.
fixed rules in feeding are not prac
ical.
Overfeeding is wasteful; underfeed
ng is unprofitable. The cows must be
well nourished at all times, but if
riven more than they need for main
enance and production, they waste
t as a rule.
Never stir up dust or foul odors at
nilking time. If you do a lot of it
s sure to get into the milk.
Whether to feed' the cows just be
'ore milking is a much debated ques
ion. It is not at all dangerous to
eed them a little grain, provided you
tir up no dust or disagreeable odors.
As a rule, the cows will give down
heir milk more freely when they have

ontented minds, and a little of the
-ight kind of feed goes a long way
oward bringing about this contented
tate of mind. Never clean the stables
ust before milking, for it will stir up
tenfold worse odor than any feed
he cows will eat.
Surrounding conditions have much
o do with the milk-producing value of
Lny ration.
Dairy cows cannot make as goQ4l
ise of whole grain as they can of
-ain that has been ground.
In the generality of cases, iieifers
ith their first calf do not show as
igh a test of butterfat as they do at
,more mature age.
A period of rest before freshening
vill usually produce a larger flow of
nilk than where the animal is milked

A man can better afford to sell but
er at the cost of liroduction than to
el grain, that is, when the selling
rice of the'butter includes the feeds
.nd labor at their market value.
0W TO GROW BLACKBERRIES
ruit Will Not Thrive in Dry Places,
Plenty of Moisture Is Needed
Cultivate Constantly.
Blackbrries need plenty of mois
ure and it will not pay to'plant them
n the top of some dry knoll; for the
ruit will not grow to perfection in
uch dry places, and it. will be hard
nd sour. Choose a place where the
-round is of good quality, and' where
here is plenty of moisture.
Prepare the ground thoroughly by
slowing and harrowing before plant
ng, and make the ground mellow
.own quito deep where you set the
lants. You cannot be .too particular
a this respect-remember you are set
ing them out for profit and not simply
o see whether they* will grow or not.
hey should be set about four feet
part one way, and eight feet the
ther way.

ultivation, and the sooner' you can

Poultry keepers may easily reduce

nests is, of course, necessary, but an.
ample number means no more,
and probably not as many as, arenusu.:

with a sufficient num~ber, but ere i
the keeper falls down is in faling..:

In houses where the dropping-o

results when newly-laid eggs fallupoz
