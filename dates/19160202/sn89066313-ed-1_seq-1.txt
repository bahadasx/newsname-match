City Council Frowns on Pro

DISCUSSION W A R M
No Theoretical Man Needed
in Practical Matter, Klass
Contends.
1 haw. during my term in the
iiiiinril and hefori'. tried to bring
about a cordial fellowship between
tin- (ouiicil and the University com
munity, but I see from indications to
night in this room that such a Uilng
is impossible. Hereafter, I will never
again suggest to this body the asking
of adUcc from any member of the
University faculty."
This statement from O. D. Kellogg,
who is a professor in the University,
closed a heated discussion in the City
Council last night regarding the pur
chase of an air compressor recom
mended by Chief Engineer M. E.
Fawks for the water and light plant.
The compressor will be used to raise
the efficiency of a number of wells at
llie municipal plant.
The recommendation to buy a
WorthLngton-Corliss compressor, to
cost $6,100, was made by Mr. Fawks.
Councilman E. B. McDonnell, after
some discussion, moved that the air
comnrcssor be bought. The motion
was not seconded. Councilman Kel
logg moved that the council adjourn
until r. o'clock this afternoon, at
which time a written report upon the
machines considered could be pre
sented both by Mr. Fawks and a con
sulting mechanical engineer from the
University. Councilman Klass then
seconded the motion of Mr. McDon
nell. Mayor J. M. Batterton declared
the motion of McDonnell in order and
it was passed unanimously.
The discussion of the compressor
purchase opened after the reading of
the recommendation by Mr. Fawks.
Councilman Kellogg asked for a short
tension of time in which Mr. Fawks
could secure the advice of a consult
ing mechanical engineer and in which
a written report could be prepared by
both and presented to the council.
Counsels Against Haste.
"I am not prepared to vote on this
matter tonight," be said. "I do not
believe that we should be too hasty
in the purchase of the machine and
the expenditure of the city's money.
Dean McCaustland will give us the
services of one of nis assistants, a
specialist in mechanical engineering,
to aid Mr. Fawks. I understood that
Mr. Fawks was to tell us tonight
when be would give a report, and
hence 1 am unprepared to vote intel
ligently on the motion, though I do
not wish to oppose the purchase of
the compressor."
"This is a practical matter," said
Councilman Klass. "Mr. Fawks has
had more practical experience than
any man in the University and I am
willing to take his recommendation.
This is not a theoretical problem and
I do not see the necessity of calling

Prior to his election to this office in

sions secretary of the State Senate.

in any theoretical man to help us. I
have confidence in our engineer. If
I did not have, I would want the city
to replace him with another and more
competent man."
"I feel that I must reply to what
has just been said," replied Council
man Kellogg. "I also have confidence
in Mr. Fawks and his ability. But I
would like to ask Mr. Fawks one
question. Would you want this prop
osition to be voted on, Mr. Fawks, on
your recommendation alone or would
you rather have your judgment con
firmed by a consulting engineer? Per
sonally, I think it good policy to seek
advice from others to make sure that
my own judgment is sound."
Mr. Fawks did not reply to the
question. Councilman Klass again
took the floor and stated that he
though' it the duty of the council to
accept Mr. Fawks' recommendation
without further comment.
Quotes Dean McCaustland.
Councilman McDonnell said that
Dean McCaustland had stated that a
compressor would increase the ef
ficiency of the water system of the
city and he (McDonnell) thought that
his advice, with the recommendation
of the engineer, was enough. It was
a ma'ter of getting water and getting
it quick, he said. He moved that Mr.
Fawks" recommendation be accepted
ad the compressor bought. The

jncilraan W. D. Shaw agreed
with Mr. Kellogg and asked, since
such a large amount of city money
was to be spent, that two or three
days' delay hi given to secure the ad
vice of a consulting engineer.
Councilman McDonnell referred to
the delay in purchasing the unit for
the electric lighting system and said
that the delay had not benefited the
city.
"I don't think that we ought to be
running around hunting men to run
the affairs of the city," lie concluded.
"We have been elected to do this. We
need water and we need it righ.
away."
"Then I think," said Councilman
Shaw, "that the responsibility for any
failures are up to Mr. McDonnell as
chairman of the water and light com
mittee and to Mr. Fawks as chief
engineer. I have perfect confidence
in Mr. Fawks, but this is a matter
of spending a large sum of the peo
ple's money and I think we should
proceed cautiously."
McDonnell and Shaw Differ.
Councilman JIcDonnell said that
the council would be held responsible
if the city was without water. Council
man Shaw replied that the same cry
had been made concerning the elec
trical unit and that the delay had not
left the city without lights and had
strengthened the position of the coun
cil. In reply to the statement of Coun
cilman McDonnell that the city was
forced to use water from the reserve
lakes to supply the town, Councilman
Shaw declared that when a sanitary
investigation was being made of the
water. Councilman McDonnell had
stated that no water was being used
out of the lake.
"I only ask a delay of two or three
days," said Councilman Shaw. "We
have already delayed two or three
months, and I do not see that a few
more days will throw the wafer plant
In any worse condition."
Councilman Virgil Hawkins said
that he thought the air compressor
matter had been definitely settled.
"I would like to ask here," said
Councilman E. G. Davis, "what would
happen if Mr. Fawks and the expert
disagreed? Mr. Fawks has to operate
these machines and it seems to me
that his judgment should be taken.
Whose opinion arc we to take?
Moves for Postponement.
"We would take tue opinion, re
plied Councilman Kellogg, "of the
man who gave us the best written
reasons why we should use the par
ticular machine he recommended. The
reason I have asked for reports is
because of a lack of knowledge on
my part and not a lack of confidence
In Mr. Fawks. Any further discus
sion of this matter will put Mr. Shaw
and myself In a false light as opposing
this improvement, and we most cer
tainly do not. Because of this I move
that this meeting be adjourned until
5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, at
which time we can have the written
reports presented to us and pass
finally upon the purchasing of the
compressor."
"I wish to second Mr. McDonnell's
motion," said Councilman Klass. "I
"Unless it breaks up there is great
danger that the wheat will be injured,
especially on the ice-covered low
lands," said Mr. Nelson today. "We
have a 17 per cent smaller acreage
to start with and the prospects for a
bumper wheat crop are being lessened
by the continued ice."
Mr. Xelson urges the farmers to
piotect the quail during these days
of adversity when the snow and Ice
covered ground furnishes the birds no
sustenance.
"Throw out your left-overs to the
quail." he said. "Give them grain to
eat. If you tide them over this icy
season, they will reciprocate by pro
tecting jour crops from chinch hugs
and other insect pests later on."

Itiia! Candidates Are Out for Fresh,
man Presidency.
The freshman political bosses have
begun their organization for the fresh
man election, which Is to he held the
latter part of the month.
Every jear, s-oon after the second
semester begins, political gangs are
made overnight, and begin their strug
gle for supremecy. The issues be
tween the different factions vary from
year to year. Sometimes there is a
fraternity and "barb" division: at
other times, a departmental dhision.
This time it seems that the light for
the highest freshman honors will
wage between the two largest cities
of the state, Kansas City and St. Louis.
Ralph W. Fischer will lead tile St.
Louis faction and Nathan S. Scarritt
the Kansas City faction for freshman
president. Both ire in the College of
Arts and Science.
Steps are being taken tiiis year by
freshmen of all departments to make
the coming election not a depart
mental fight. In previous years, the
freshmen of the College of Agricul
ture and the School of Engineering
have formed a "combine" against the
rest of the freshmen.

Tiiis is Groundhog Day. And un
less the bright snow this morning daz
zled tlie eyes of the distinguished vis
itor, be undoubtedly saw bis shadow.
Mr. Groundhog awoke, from bis long
winter snooze bright and early this
morning, stretched himself languidly
and decided that the time had come
for him to shake off his prolonged hi
bernation. When he crawled out of
Mis burrow under a log to sample the
crisp February air, he was greeted by
an icy blast and snow-covered ground.
Proceeding a little farther from his
underground home, he was warmly
welcomed by His Solar Majesty,
whose rays fell upon him from the
rear. He saw himself silhouetted
against the white ground. "Not for
mine!" he ejaculated. "This means
six weeks more of cold weather." So
saying, he scrambled back into bis
winter quarters, to remain there un
til the middle of March.
A Myth, Snjs George Reeder.
The foregoing may be believed by
those who are superstitious, but
George Reeder, director of the United
States Weather Bureau in Columbia,
says it is all a myth. Ho says that
Mr. Groundhog is a very unreliable
forecaster and that he seldom tells the
truth. However, Mr. Reeder refused
to give out any definite statement as
to what the weather will be during the
next si weeks, as his scientific meth
ods are not far enough advanced for
ham to foretell what, the weather will
be more than three or four days ahead.
Statistics show that the temperature
for every montii this winter lias been
above the normal and that February
Is just as likely to be warm as cold.
January was a month of very mark
ed changes, both in temperature and
weather conditions. There were four
thunderstorms during the month, on
January 1, 11, 20 and 29. The aver
age January has one of these. Only
in two years, 1S9S and 1907, did Jan
uary equal this year's number since
the bureau was established here in
1SS9.
Only Sewn Clear Dnjs In Month.
January had only seven clear days.
The average is eleven. There were
only 102 hours of sunshine during the
month. There were twenty cloudy
days and fifteen rainy days. The av
erage for twenty years is thirteen
cloudy days and eight rainy days.
The highest temperature recorded
was C3 above zero, and the lowest 11
below. There were C.S inches of rain,
which for January is the greatest
rainfall since 1S97. Snowfall amount
ed to 2.S inches. A drop of 47 de
grees occurred on January 5. From
September to February the tempera
ture has ranged from V- to 6' de
grees above the normal.
The Rev. 0. Fisher discussed the
origin of Candlemas Day. February 2,
in an article in "Nature," 1912. Pro
verbs show that this has always been
considered a critical day from the
meteorological point of view; for ex
ample: "If Candlemas Day be fine and clear.
There'll be two winters in one year.
If Candlemas Day bring clouds and
rain.
Winter is gone and won't come again."

South African liner Appam, given up
as lost In a storm last week by its
owners, steamed Into port here yes
terday, flying the German flag and
in charge of a German prize crew.
The Appam was captured off the
Canary Island January 15 by a Ger
man raider.
The passengers, relating the details
of the capture, as thrilling as any
pirate story, said the Appam was cap
tured by the Moewe, an armed mer
chant vessel.
Armed men from the raider board
ed the liritish ship, and a bloody fight
ensued. The captain, seeing defense
futile, surrendered.
There are 431 persons aboard the
ship, including 13S survhors of seven
ships sunk by tlie raider which cap
tured the Appam, 20 German civilians
being transferred from Africa to Eng
land to be placed in detention camps,
153 members of the Appam's crew,
llfi original passengers on the Appam
and the prize crew of 22.
Two of the crew are dead, and oth
ers are expected to die, as a result
of the fighting with the German sail
ors.
It is generally believed the Appam
will be interned as a German prize of
war.
