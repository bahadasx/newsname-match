The location of the Commercial as
sociation in new and attractive quar
ters will be the principal task which
the new administration of the. organ
ization will have before It during the
coming year. At the meeting last
evening there was a strong and ur
gent sentiment for new rooms and a
number of members declared the re
juvenation and reorganization of the
association depended upon new quar
ters. President-elect Brock, following the
meeting lust evening, declared that
he would direct his efforts first ani
foremost for new rooms and declar
ed that there is no valid reason for
delaying the building or Hating of
rooms more In keeping with the pro
gressive spirit of the city "The
club has been talking new quarters
for 15 years." he said, "and has been
putting the matter off year after
year on the plea that sufficient mon
ey could not be raised. And yet we
have raised $12.'""' for the buying of
Hound-up Park and ITO.OOO for a
swimming pool and other funds with
out number. Attractive Commercial
club rooms Is one of the biggest
needs of the city and we cannot af
ford to wait any longer
Incidentally President llrock voiced
his oplniun that new quarters wlli
solve the membership problem over
which there was extended discussion j
at the meeting. Fit up rooms such
as the business men will be glad to i
visit and take their friends and you
won't have any trouble about getting
and keeping members. You will have!
to offer your members something In
return for their dues besides the op
portunity of service."
The committee on membership last 1
evening recommended that, effective
April 1. the business men members
be required to pay 2.0 monthly dues
and other members, such as clerks
and employes, pay $1 for an associate
membership, such associate member
ship to give them the social privileges
hut not any voice In the business af
fairs of the organization.
There was both endorsement and
objection to this plan. Some mem
bers objected strenuously to a dual
system of dues, others favored the
plan of making the big business,
houses pay more than their employes
but objected to the proposal to de-

until l:M s.terday there had been 10 Inches and from l:M last evening un

wa- approximately 9 inches on Hie ground. I'nofricial nieasuremonto over
the dt make the depth this afternoon vary Ixtween 30 inches ami three feet.
The schools have been disneissed on
account of the difficulty of the chil
dren wading through the snow, prac
tically all railway traffic has been
blocked. taxLeabs and automobiles
have ceased to operate on the streets
and few vehicles of any character are
out. Hoofs of sheds and outhouses
are beginning to fall under their
heavy loads and there is danger of
the flat-topped roofs of business
buildings giving way.
The sidewalks have become so im
passable that the police are out no
tifying residents to clear them under
penalty of arrest. And. while rest
dents are putting up with the Incon
veniences and hardships of the pres
ent with as much spirit as possible,
there is grave apprehension felt by
many over the possibility of damag
ing floods when the snow goes off.
Trains Annulled.
There has been no train over the
S.-W, R. & N. main line from the
east since No. 17 which arrived at 2
stockmen over a report that a Port
land concern has bought up much
feed for speculative purposes.
Whether the report Is true or not
is not apparent, though it is known
one concern has matte considerable
purchases in the Hermlston country
The chief difficulty at present aris
es from the fact it Is very hard to gel
fed to the stock or to drive stock to
the feed when a shift is necessary
Another element making the situation
harder is the fact most all stock
went into winter in rather poor shape
due to the fact there was no fall
grass because of dry weather last
unutter and fall. There are stock
men who have been feeding since the
middle of October and consequently
are requtie.l to meet extraordinar
