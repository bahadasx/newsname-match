Five new heet sugar factories will

PROJECT V LL
PINEAPPLE PACK
OF ISLANDS VILL
IJ
Output in 191 6 Will Be 500,000
Cases Less Than Last Year,
Says James D. Dole
FURTHER DECREASE IN
1917 IS LOOKED FOR
Hawaiian Pineapple Co. Earned
Dividend Despite Adverse
Year, Says Report
Hawaiian pineapple canners. who
for two years have struggled against
an overproduction of fruit which tend
ed to break prices and in many cases
reduce profits to the vanishing point,
are facing better times.
The boom in pineapple planting,
which broke in 1913, is now a thing
of the past. Great areas are now go
ing out of bearing, with the result
that this year the pack of the Hawaii
an islands is likelv to be less than
1,500,000 cases, against 1.984,785 cases
in 1915. There is even a prospect of
a further decrease in the 1917 yield.
The foregoing figures are deduced
from the annual report of James D.
Dole, president and general manager
of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company,
Ltd., which was submitted this after
noon at the annual meeting of the
shareholders of the company. Presi
dent Dole said, in part:
High Mark Is Passed.
"The year 1915 witnessed the high
mark :n pineapple production of the
Hawaiian islands, and the maximum
result of the boom in pineapple plant
ing, . which culminated in the enor
mciis area planted during the years
1911, 1912 and 1913. A pineapple plant
takes approximately a year and a half
to two years to come into bearing, re
mains in bearing from two to four
years, but after its second crop, its
output declines very rapidly.
"The boom in -pineapple planting
may be, said to have broken in 1913,
and the disastrous effect on 'many of
the growers of the low prices since
obtained have further curtailed plant
ings. Hundreds of acres of old fields
are going out of bearing this year and
cannot be brought into bearing again
before 1919 or 1920 at the earliest.
These conditions, together with the
greatly curtailed4, crops on the Island
of Maul, due to.-.the severe - weather
conditions on that island in the sum
mer of 1914, "will result in a decrease
in the pack of the 'Hawaiian islands
for the year 1916 of at least 500,000
cases, very likely more, followed by a
still further decrease in 1917."
Dividends Kept Up.
That his company was able to earn
a dividend in spite of the fact that,
for the second consecutive year, Ha
waiian canned pineapple sold at a
price materially below the average isl
and cost of production, was another
statement made by James D. Dole,
president and manager of the Hawaii
an Pineapple Company, at the annual
meeting of the stockholders this after
noon. '
Mr. Dole's report showed that the
company '8 pack for the year was
17,570,445 cans or 790,785 cases, which
was an increase of 106,305 cases over
1914. The increase, Mr. Dole said,
was due entirely to the purchase of
fruit from outside growers.
Own Tonnage Was Less.
Because the company had curtailed
its own plantings in 1913, the deliv
erieVot, fruit from its own plantation
amounted last year to 15,681 tons, or
a decrease of 2S34 tons from the 1914
deliveries. Purchased fruit amounted
to 15,886 tons, which was an increase
of 6876 tons over 1914.
"In spite of a comparative inerease
in our sugar cost over 1914 of approxi
mately $44,000." he continued, "the
costs of the factor' and plantation
operations have been satisfactory and
in general have shown improvements
over previous results. During the
year we reached the point where we
had entirely outgrown our old wooden
office and have erected a new rein
forced concrete and tile two-story
building at a cost of $18,510.73. We
have no further capital expenditures
of any moment in view."
Koolau Fruit Business Big.
Commenting on the business of the
Koolau Fruit Company, which is
owned by the Hawaiian Pineapple
Company, Mr. Dele said that, during
the year, it sold 7248. tons of fruit as
against 6035 tons in 1914.
It was pointed out that the pineap
ple company is still unable to resume
business with its German customers,
but that, contrary to expectations,
business with Great Britain and
France has increased 33 1-3 per cent
in 1915. About a year ago the com
pany concluded to employ an expert
chemist with a view to working up
by-products, improving the quality and
uniformity of the syrup, studying cer
tain chemical problems and securing
a more scientific control over packing.
"The results," Mr. Dole explained,
"have fully justified the inauguration
of this department and it is hoped
that further gains mav result from it
in the future."
It was thought unlikely that any
great changes in the directorate would
be made at today's meeting.
A jury in federal court today re
turned a verdict of not guilty in the
case of F. Paige, who was charged
with having cocaine In possession.

Charles R. Forbes Makes Plea
for "GetTogether Spirit"
at Club Luncheon
Citing examples of criticism that
are continually being sent to Wash

that a strong feeling is beginning to
exiBt in the national capital that may
be a change of government should be
adopted here that would be far less
acceptable than the present one,
Charles R. Forbes today urged mem
bers of the Ad Club to boost a get

spoke at the noon luncheon.
"Members of Congress are begin

with us out here," he said, "and whe
ther or not we know just what we do
want
"National legislators thought it
was pretty small criticism that came

Governor Not Only One.
"Your governor is not the only one
that is being criticized, for criticism

and myself.
"We have been accused of most ev

The novel phase is presented whether the steamer is a prize of war
or is in effect a German warship. 1 V
By the treaty of 1828 with Germany, it is provided that prizes
taken from the British shall not remain in American ports on account
of the previous treaty between the United. btates and Great Britain.
The British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, has formally ask.
