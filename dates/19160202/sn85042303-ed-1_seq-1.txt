NUMBER 101.
Little Kock, Ark., Feb. 2.
No information has been re
ceived today on the fate of the
eijrhl hundred negro convicts at
Cummins penal farm, where
the Arkansas flood is at its
height and where the river is
cutting to pieces the huge lev
ees in iront of the convict farm.
A second elfort to rescue the
men will be made today. Half
of the number of convicts are
on the levees, and the other
half are in the back camps.
Several hundred persons are
reported marooned near Doug
las, and will be without food
unless aid is sent to them soon.
Houses are inundated in the
other flooded towns, and hun

Negro Convicts in Peril.
Little Hock, Ark., Feb. 2. The most
serious situation in the most wide
spread flood Arkansas has ever known
"1'Pearn to be
at the state farm at
night. Their position Is perilous. The
steamer Bay Queen, carrying John T.
Buikett, member of tho state peniten
tiary commission, steamed out of Fine
Bluff this afternoon in an unsuccessful
effort to rescue, them, If today's sec
ond expedition Is a success, the con
victs will bo taken to Swan Lake, fif
teen miles up tho river from the state
farm, where they will be placed on
j " trili "1 brought to the penitentiary
at Little Hock. The swift current and
the swollen condition of the river
makes the trip hazardous.
Coiiiiinissioner JSurkett said that If
tho convicts are rescued, ho will send
the steamer back down the river to
ficient to last ten days.. The white con
victs were removed from the state
farm last night.
Oat Sowing Time.
Robert F. Scivally left here today
for his ranch at Springer and will
spend the remainder of the week
there. He will make preparations to
sow oats as soon as he can, but he Is
of the opinion that a plow cannot be
taken Into the fields for ten days yet
on account of the heavy rainfall dur
ing January; especially will it be ten
days before any work can be done on
land that was plowed in the fall.
Oats are generally in the ground by
the middle of this month, but they
may be sown any time up to March 1.
