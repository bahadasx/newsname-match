Weather Prophet
Despite occassional snow flurries,
a cold bleak northeasterly wind, and
a temperature that failed to get
over the 17 above zero mark, the
ground hog Wednesday saw his
shadow. He came out, shivered,
looked around, saw the tell-tale ev
idence of 4M more days of winter
and skurried back into his hole.
Henry S valm, government weather
observer, take isue with the little
forecaster, the ground hog. Mr.
Swaim believes it is too cold and too
early by about three weeks in this
latitude for the animal to discon
tinue his hibernating. "Consoling."
said Mr. Swaim, "but that is not an
indication that there won't be the
4 0' more days of winter."
The temperature ranged from nine
above early in the morning to IT
above at noon as a maximum. Flur
ries of snow felbduring the morning,
and black clouds gathered in the
east several times, but there was no
decided change in the weather.
B-r-r-r! Fifteen above, and the
ground hog saw his shadow. Chances
of a premature spring seem doomed.

four Pupils Are Being Taught
by Miss Ethel M'Donald
at Healthwin.
In a small shack very meagerly
furnished and equipped the nucleus
of St. Joseph county's first open air
.school has been begun at the Anti
tuberculosis hospital. School open
ed Monday and the pupils number
four. They are all little girls and
patients at the hospital. Their
teacher is Miss Fthel McDonald, a
graduate of South Rend high school
who had been prepared to teach be
fore her health failed.
One of the shacks which housed
patients before the present hospital
was erected has been converted into
a Hchool room by the Installation of
desks for pupils and teacher. Dur
ing the school hours from 9 o'clock
to 1 1 : o 0 each morning: the windows
of the shack are left wide open and
the children, warmly bundled in!
coats and hoods, do all their study
ing and reciting practically In the
open air, so that their progress to
ward health may not be delayed nor
their schooling neglected while they
are confined to the hospital.
Two of the children are in the
fourth grade and two in the fifth.
Miss McDonald is covering in her
instruction all the common school
branches, devoting one day to one
group of studies and the next to an
other. The equipment of the little
school room is very' slight indeed. It
lacks a blackboard and mnp r.nd
many other small things which are
considered necessities in the modern
school room, but interest in the work
has already been aroused in the city
and it is proh.-ible that these needs
will soon be supplied.

at Red Fork, Ark., early today, after
having been marooned on the roof
of a cotton shed for four days, part
of the time without food. Several of
the rescued were so ill from ex
posure that death was feared.
A leeve protecting the town of
Varner, Ark., gave way about 1
o'clock this morning, flooding that
town.
The situation at Newport. Ark.,
was even worse than yesterday Wa
ter stood today six feet in every
street in the ' almost depopulated
town. The water back of the levees
had frozen during the past 24 hours
and was thick enough today to bear
skaters. Horses and cattle were
found frozen in and had to be
chopped loose from the ice.

under water. The Mississippi levee
was weakening and engineers who
have been on duty for several days
fear a break.

will endanger the city of Helena,
Ark.
Water pouring through a break at
Watson, Ark., today covered Drew,
Ashley, Lincln. Desho, Chicot and
11 other parishes in'northern Lou
isiana. In these sections today more
than 13,0oo people were calling for
help. Rescue parties were working
night and day. but their efforts were
greatly hampered by high wind and
strong current.
West Hickman. Ky.. was entirely
under water today and more than
half of the town of Hickman was
Hooded. The federal government was
reported to be sending provisions to
thse places.
Levees from the

Harold Severy is Believed to
be Responsible For Mys

International News Service;
ALBANY, N. Y., Feb. 2. Await
ing examination by alienists today,
Harold Seery, son of Melvirj L.
Severy of lis Angeles, believed to
be the "mysterious gunman" who for
four days terrorized residents of Al
bany and caused the death of James
Erwin and the serious injury of
three other persons, is being held by
the Albany police. He was arrested
in Schenectady yesterday. No for
mal charge has been lodged against
Severy yet. The charge probably
will be assault, first degree.-according
to Dist. Atty. Alexander.
The story drawn from Severy after
a gruelling- cross-examination by the
district attorney and Chief of Police
Hyatt, is fanciful, yet replete with
all the horrors of mental torture.
Severy explained his reasons for hav
ing used a concealed and curiously
contrived revolver upon his victims,
in a disjointed narrative, covering
five years of aimless, but persistent
flight through fear.
Severy lir.st avoided those whom
he said mocked him after he left his
luxurious home, he is said to have
revealed in his examination. Upon
one occasion he sprang upon one of
those who anonyed him, only to re
ceive a thrashing. It was then that
Severy determined to resort to the
r.je of sulph'irie acid.
It was learned by Iist. Atty. Alex
ander that Severy has been an in
mate in Mclean hospital at Waver
Iy, Mass., six years ago, where he
was retained for one year. He de
clared to his inquisitors that he was
not insane. Severy will be arraign

Sec'y Lansing.
Internationa! Ne-ns Service:
BERLIN, Feb. 2. (via Sayville
by wireless) Although it is admit
ted that diplomatic relations' between
Germany and the United States have
been perilously near a complete rup
ture it was olTicially announced today
by the German foreign otlice that
fresh representations have been
made to Washington by which it is
believed the Lusitania case will be
amicably adjusted.
The following statement was given
out:
"It is true that, on Saturday, the
2ith, a telegraphic, report from the
German ambassador in Washington
was received in Herlin according to
which it had been found impossible
to adjust the Lusitania case in a
manner satisfactory to both sides
through the medium of friendly
verbal exchanges of views.
"However, instructions, have been
transmitted today by telegraph to
the German ambassador in Wash
ington which give reasonable hope
for a positive understanding."
International News erVire:
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2. Ger
many's answer to Pres't Wilson's
"last word" that she must disavow
the Lusitania sinking is en route
from Berlin. Count von Bernstorff.
the German ambassador, is now in
Washington waiting to present it to
Sec'y Lansing. He is hopeful that
it u'ill meet the views of the United
States. But administration olfkials
are seriously apprehensive.
They point mit that SVc'y Irn
sing has made it plain that he and
Pres't Wilson have agreed on the
course of action snould the reply be
a refusal. And in the face of a re
fusal to indicate what that plan is.
olfieials generally are convinced that
it contemplates a direct warning
that only disavowal will prevent a
break in diplomatic relations.
Teutonic circles continue to believe
that the lates. German rej.Iy will
present a solution that this govern
ment o.p accept. It is pointed uiit
that there is now no cause to com
plain oT the management of the sub
marine campaign and that there i?
no apparent need for any ultimatum
to settle the points at issue in th
Lusitania case. But until the text
of the Berlin reply reaches here it
is said at the embassy th.-it spec
ulation on what will be done is con
sidered useless.
Sec'y Lansing denied today that
there was any connection between
the "vacation" of Ambassador Mor
genthau. who is leaving Constantin
ople, for a rer:t rr.d the destruction
of the Persia. While this govern
ment h;is asked Turkey whether a
Turkish submarine sank' that liner,
this action was taken as a matter of
routine. It is generally believed
that Turkey has had no submarines
in fhe Mediterranean since shortly
after she entered the war. Accord
ing to Sec'v Iinsin-c, Morgenthau
has been at Iiis post continuously

been granted "vacation leave." He
