CITY WATER LINE IN DANGER
Fight For Fair Rates
Is Carried Direct to
Tourists Themselves
The Times today joined with its sister papers
in Seattle, Spokane and Portland, in sending a
complete account of the fight of Northwest bus
iness men against the southern railroads for
equal and just passenger rates to the Newspaper
Enterprise Association, to which we belong.
Through the association, this article
will be relayed to more than 100 other news
papers published throughout the United
States.
The article is an appeal to tourists, nearly all
of whom, when visiting the Pacific Coast, either
would come or return by way of Tacoma if the
rates were not $17.50 higher in the summer and
$21.75 higher in the winter, via the Northwest.
These tourists are asked to help Tacoma and
the Northwest in this fight, which is also their
fight.
The battle is going to be won. Are you
doing your part?

FRANCE, FIGHTING, CRADLES DREAM
OF A WARLESS, KINGLESS WORLD!
RV ROBERT MINOR.
The French war office, after much persua
sion and largely because I had been a student
at the National Art school, gave me a permit to
roam at a reasonable distance behind their Hues
and make sketches of what I could ace. .My first
stop was at the little village of Sermalze, or what
used to be the village, for long ago, In the second
month of the war, it was made a heap of iiibhlsh
by the German guns.
A few boards leaned against the standing
walls of ruined houses, smoke curlln_> from
makeshift chimneys, and now and then v
family constructing a similar ahanty, con
stituted the "town."
It was a doleful sight to apply a sketch-pad to.
Here and there a wooden shack, swinging the
sign "Cafe," catered to the thirst and hunger of
troops moving to and from the front When
darkness cut short the sketching, I entered ono
of these for supper. It was full of Soldiers.
Everyone Is polite in France (except civil ser
vice employes), and the waitress politely found
a soldier willing politely to move up and let me
have a place at the table. I went after the pork
chops and potatoes, after politely saluting the
crowd.
Out there In the war country, strangers aro
rare. Very soon I discovered that everyone
wanted to talk to me. They were hungry for
news from the world outside of trendies, tho
world they had not seen for over v year. So,
after they had politely asked whether ".Mon
sieur" would mind talking a bit, there followed
one of the most interesting conversations I havf
ever had.
In two tours of Europe, before and after the
war, amongst all nationalities, including Ger
mans slowly dying from French bullets, I HAVE
NEVER, EXCEPT ONCE, MET A PERSON WHO
DID NOT LOVE FRANCE. And among these
plain soldiers, that night, was to be found the
charn. that accounts for this.
In simple language, each unfolded hi*
views of the war. They were not like the
views of the non-fighters I had met in
Paris. The most rabid haters and insane
talkers were always those that had found

BRITISH WANT NEW ENEMY
LONDON, Eng.. Feb. '.—ENG
LAND WANTS ANOTHER ENE
MY!
Such Is the startling theory
being advanced here today by
those who say the war ministry
would be g'?._ to have Sweden en
ter the war on the German side.
With Sweden and Germany
allied, England's navy can
blockade the Swedish coast
north of Denmark and shut
off the most Important gate
way through which Germany
is receiving food and manu
facture*, from the neutral
world.
Not only that—Great Britain's
cause for disputes with the Unit
ed States would be largely re
moved If Sweden lined up aa aa
enemy, because the blockade
could be mr.de effective and not
by suffering, was the impress of France's think
ers. They nil wanted the war to stop; they nil
wanted to get again onto the basis of friendship
with the world, in sharp contrast'to the vindic
tive spirit of the war writers that claim to repre
sent French feeling. How I wished that some
American crowds I've seen could be as brond
and tolerant of an "enemy" people as those fel
lows were!
But France is the home of new, daring think
ing, especially of the modern cry that THE
WHOLE WORLD SHOULD CONTAIN BUT ONE
PEOPLE, WITHOUT KINGS AND WITHOUT
WARS. That was the starting point of the
thinking of each of those soldiers in that cafe.
As the evening wore on and the talk became
more intimate, the heat from the red-hot stove
and the mild red wine seemed to get the better
of the discretion of one of them. "The Interna
tional for me," he said.
And then he begun to sing the French
workiiigmnn's song, "The International,"
the song they sing to proclaim fraternity
between all nations, defiance of rulers,
peace and co-operation. It Is the song the
police ill cad to hear In strike*, nnd it is ab
solutely forbidden In time of war.
The other soldiers stirred uneasily. One got up
and came over to the singer, saying, "It is not tho
time." They got about him and persuaded him
to stop. But as 1 looked about at the faces of
those men I saw in each that he, too, wanted to
sing that song.
I climbed absentmindedly onto a train for
Nancy, and settled into a seat to dream about it.
It was the finest thing that I had seen, the most
hopeful sign that all civilization was not de
stroyed in this war, that progress was still pos
sible. An officer was eyeing me curiously. He
was very polite—whenever I looked up sharply,
his eyes would politely shift from my face. He
gazed long and intently at my suitcase In the
rack above.
Aa the train pulled Into Nancy, he disappeared,
and when I left the car I was arrested as a Ger
man spy. When they saw my papers and let me
go, 1 examined my suitcase to discover what had
interested the officer.
It was a fragment of an old steamship sticker
of long ago when I had made a voyage on the
"Kronprlnz William," and barely visible was the
word "Nordeutscher."
"on paper." And Sweden couldn't
do much harm to the allied cause;
& few troops might cross into
Russian Lapland, and Sweden's
small navy might join "the Ger
mans, already outnumbered, In
the Kiel canal. That would be
all.
Shipments of American goods
destined for Sweden, which Eng
land maintains are Intended for
reshipin.nl to Germany, have
been the principal cause of con
teentlon with Washington. With
Sweden In the war, England
would substitute an actual block
ade of Germany and Sweden for
th? present paper blockade of
Germany—and oae of the admir
alty's perplexing problems would
be solved.
Diplomatic England won't ad
mit It, of course. But you hear It
rumored that British submarine
activity in the Baltic, British In
terference with Swedish com
merce, haa one deep purpose; to
aggravate Sweden so that Sweden
will want to declare war.
And Germany, in secret, is
striving to keep Sweden neutral.
Germany doesn't want Sweden as
an ally.
Sweden already is retaliating
against England by stopping par

convoys to the merchant men t
crossing the Baltic to Germany,
thus crippling Britain's subma
