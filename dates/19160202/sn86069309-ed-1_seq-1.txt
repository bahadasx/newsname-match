FOR CONGRESS
Prominent Breckenridge County
Republican Likely to Run.
A number of prominent Fourth Dis
trict Republicans wee here yesterday
attending the meeting of lh Congress
lonal Committee. There was a good
deal of talk among them about the lie
publican candidate for ('ongrest, Hep
resentatlve Lyon, of Hart county, who
was Assistant Secretary of State un-
der Hon. Btn Bruner, Is known to have
his lightening rod up and also Repre
sentative Spurrier, of Graf son county,
would like to shy his caster in the
Congressional ring, but If Hon. John
P. Haswell, of Breckenridge county,
will consent to become a candidate,
the general talk is that all other prc-b
able aspirants will give him a clear
track. The Republicans think they
have a chance to carry this district
because it went about 5OO for Morrow
over Stanley. John P. Haswell is de
cidedly the ablest and most popular
Republican in this district and if the
Republicans will urge him to run, he
is said to be willing to enter the race.
The tip Is that he will have no opposi
tion in his party Elizabethtown

TO FORCE FIGHT
ON STATEWIDE
Advocates of Statewide in Gen
eral Assembly Have Not Aban
doned Hope of Victory.
DEFEAT IN THE SENATE.
Frankfort, Ky., Jan. M, Prospects
of a renewed Statewide prohibition
tight in the House loomed up in n state
ment issued by W. M. Webb, of 1'aints
ville, author of the amendment which
carried that body at the IHI4 session.
Webb, who is a Republican, says that
the leading minoritv men will support
the bill and that sufficient Democratic
votes will be secured to pass the House.
There is no chance of the amend
ment being reported favorabU . It is
iu the hands of the Constitutional
Amendments Committee, a dripping
wet body. If the gfJFI expect to biing
the bill on the floor for a fight, they
will have to stage a test battle to get it
I nere.
Webb's statement follows:
"The advocates of Statewide prohi
bition in the General Assembly are not
defeated, nor have they abandoied
hope of whining victory at this sessuo.
Statements published in liquor con
trolled papers, purporting to have bten
made by dry leaders, have been garbled
ana distorted
Gallant Fight.
"Our leaders in the Senate made a
gallant light, aud had it uot been lor
tne 'third house,' compose I of the so
called leaders of the two political par
ties, and the gigantic whisky lobby
always found about the Capital during
sessions of the Legislature, the bill
woulu have passed by a safe majority.
"Let it not be forgotten that a ma
jority of the State Senators represent
dry constituencies, aud that those Sen
ators who voted against the will of their
constituents will have a hard time in
explaining.
"The drys in the House have not giv
en up hope. We propose to show the
people of this Commonwealth where we
stand on this question We will vin
dicate ourselves by showing that we
are not in the hands of an oligarchy at
Frankfurt; but 1l1.it we represent a
large majority of the peop.e of this
Commonwealth who are demanding at
our hands that we give them a vote 011
this question.
"The right has just begun. We will
pass it in the House withoiit a doubt
Then it will go again to the Senate,
where some of the beloved Senators
can agaiu r x lIhiii their votes
"Should we again fail in the Senate
the campaign slogan in I9I7 should be:
Keutucky is going dry. In this cam
paign we will be brought face to face
with the real issur, and the result will
be an nvsrwhollglng majority (of t tie
great cause." By Harry Bloom in

N ?m RAID
French Demand Reprisal Raid
on German City.
RUSS THREATEN ERZERUM
Paris, Jan. II. Another Boppolta
raid 011 Paris, Is In progress, the awe
ond within twenty-four hours. De
fails of the casualties and the limn
age done in this second raid are not
yet available.
I'aris. .Ian. tl, An official report of
the casualties in the first raid placed
the number of killed at twenty three
and of inj.ired at twenty-seven.
The raid was not entirely unexpect
ed as a Zeppelin was seen in the
Epernay district, previously, undoubt
edly making a trial excursion.
The effect of the raid has been only
to reproduce the effect of the former
raid. There is no sign of panic, hut
angry indignation is shown and de
mands are made that each raid shall
be answered by an aeroplane raid on
a German town.
Of the aeroplanes which arose at
Le Bourget within twenty minutes of
the alarm, not one got near enough to
the Zeppelin to Are at it.
The fact that only one Zeppelin par
ticipated In the raida, leada to the
conclusion that this was only a fore
runner of other Zeppelins.
A statement Issued by the Russian
war office says the Russians captured
near Erzei um, a party of Askarls and
three machine guns. This indicates
that while the Russians have not yet
captured the Important Armenian city,
as was unofficially reported several
days ago, the main force of Grand
Duke Nicholas is closely threatening
the stronRhold, where the Turkish
Caucasus army was recently driven.
The Russian pursuit of the Turks
south of Lake Urumiah, in Persia, con
tinues, while westward of Uamadan.
probably In the Kanavar region.
Turkish attacks were repulsed. Minor
successes are announced in south
western Russia.
The German advance in the sector
west of Peronne, announced by Ber
lin as including the village of Prise
and 1,093 yards of French trencheB,
has been extended, according to the
official German statement, until it
covers a front of 3,500 meters, to a
depth of 1,000 meters. The offensive
began about Nleuport and extended
south about Neuville-St. Vaast and,
finally to the district of Paronne.
British troops were among the
prisoners reported by the Germans
The number of prisoners claimed by
the German statement is seventeen
officers and 1.270 men. The French
are still fighting hard to regain the
i osiflons lost in the NVuville sector.
The new oillensive gives the Ger
mans, as perhaps the mojt Import an!
result so far, possession of Hill 1 10,
between Souchcz aud Vimy, and Hill
out beast of loos.
The present attack hy the Germans
on these positions is regarded as an
anticipatory measure against a pos
sible offensive hy the allies in this
sector In the spring.
