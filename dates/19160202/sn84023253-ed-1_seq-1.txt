HOUNDS MANGLED DOE
Deer Killed Within the Village Limits
v Sunday Afternoon.
A large doe caught in a wire
fence was so badly torn and mangled
by four hounds Sunday afternoon that
it was killed by C. L. Harphan and
Perdinand Townsend to put it out of
Its misery. The deer was caught on
the ridge west of the knob and was
probably the first deer to be killed
within the village limits since the
village was incorporated.
The two men were going up on the
knob to enjoy their skis and were at
tracted by the frenzied conditions of
the hounds which ran over the rise
out of sight and rushed back with
blood and flesh around their mouths.
The men followed them and found a
doe that had tried to jump through
an opening In the fence with its body
drawn through to its hips where it
was unable to move "either way. The
hounds had torn the hind quarters
nearly to pieces and the killing of it
was an act of mercy.

pose To Take Stock of E. and

Mr. Robie Jfot A Candidate.
W. H. H. Robie, who has been con
fined to the house for several months
by Illness, has been asked by many
people if he was to be a candidate for
re-election as overseer of the poor,
and announced that owing to his phy
sical condition he would not be.
Mr. Robie for the past twelve years
has served very faithfully and efficient
ly as overseer of the poor, and, with
out doubt, understands the conditions
among the poor people of the town
better than any other man, but owing
to his illness is unable to accept the
office for another year. Everyone re
grets that this is necessary, as they
feel that if he was able to perform
the duties of the office, no one else
could equal Robte.
YOU CAN'T TRUST FEBRUARY
AND MARCH THEY ARE A
TREACHEROUS PAIR.
The only safe way is to have as
good a supply of Coal on hand as
you can possibly get. I would or
der it today at least.
A business deal which may' involve
a million and .a half dollars was an
nounced last week when a circular
was issued to the stock holders of E.
and T. Fairbanks and Co. offering to
give them three shares of the six per
cent Cumulative Preferred stock of
Fairbanks, Morse & Co. for each
share of the outstanding stock of the
E. & T. Fairbanks and CompdSny.
This means if the offer is acceptedsthe
merging of the two companies and the
combining of the manufacture and
selling departments of the scale busi
ness under one management which it
is expected will greatly benefit both
departments. .
The circular containing the offer
also says: "If such an exchange of
stock be consummated, it is the in
tention and expectation of the Com
pany to continue at St. Johnsbury the
manufacture of scales and other ar
ticles, and it will be the aim and ef
fort of this Company to make a ma
terial increase in the outputs there."
The fact the present management
has expended such large sums in im
provements of the plant makes the
removal of the plant impractical at
present and the promise of the new
company to make material increase
here shows that St. Johnsbury will not
be deserted by the new concern.
The Fairbanks, Morse and Co. has
been in business over 40 years, has its
main office located in the city of Chi
cago, 111., with branch houses in every
center of importance in the United
States, In London, England, and in
Buenos Ayres, South America, with
its manufacturing plant at Beloit,
Wis., employing over 2000 men.
It is not expected there will be any
change in the local management at
present and the business will be con
ducted along the same lines as in the
past, except that it will be on a larger
scale. '
FARMERS MEETING
Caledonia County Association Elects
Officers and Hears Some
Practical Addresses.
IN COUNTY COURT
William Naigle Charged With Assault
And Intent to Kill. On Trial.
County court resumed Its session
Tuesday morning when the case of
State vs. William Naigle, who is
charged with assault with intent to
kill, was taken up" and the Jury was
quickly secured and the testimony be
gun.
Mrs. Naigle alleges that her hus
band had assaulted - her and threaten
ed to kill her and told a rather start
ling story in the court room. It is
expected that the case will be of
short duration and two or three other
criminal cases will be taken up after
that and complete the work of the
December term.
The annual meeting of the Cale
donia County Farmers association was
held in Pythian hall yesterday with a
very good attendance, good interest
shown and some very able and inter
esting addresses. A short session was
held in the forenoon, a free lunch
served in the hall and the business
speaking came in the afternoon. The
officers for the coming year are
President, W. P. Russell of Kirby.
Vice-president, E. G. Bridgeman of
Hardwick.
Treasurer, J. W. Titcomb of Lyn-
donville.
Secretary, Harvey A. Burbank of
East Barnet.
Executive committee, Asa Sargeant
of Danville, J. R. Moore of East Bar
net, W. A. Simpson of Lyndon, E. H.
Hallett of St. Johnsbury Center, A.
F. Stoddard of Sutton, J. J. Lenton of
Waterford and F. -G'. Shaw of
Peacham.
The meeting was called together at
11:40 in Pythian hall by the president
of the association, W. P. Russell of
Kirby. Secretary Harvey Burbank
gave his report stating that the secre
tary has nothing to do with the money
furnished by the government or com
ing from the towns in the county in
connection with his work. He re
ported dues and subscriptions of
$406.22, for spraying $76.25, cash on
hand $18.70 and contribution from
T. N. Vail $203.00. He suggested that
E. A. Darling, who has paid $100.00,
and T. N. Vail, who has contributed
$200, should be officially recognized
by the club.
There must be at least 200 members
of the association in good standing In
order to get the money from the towns
under the state law, so he suggested
that any man contributing more than
the regular dues of $1.00 put in the
name of other members of his family
for membership in the association.
He thought there should be a defi
nite term for the dues the same as
lodges have and that the by-laws of
jie association should be amended to
allow it. He reported the members by
towns as follows: Barnet 36, Burke 20,
Danville 27, Concord 2, Groton 3.
Hardwick 7, Kirby 6, Lyndon 36. New
ark 1, Peacham 25, Ryegate ,27, St.

Sutton 9, Walden 16, Waterford 11,
Wheelock 2, Cabot 3, Greensboro 1,
Newbury 3. Cambridge, Mass., 1, Vic
tory 1, a total of 291- members in good
standing. His report s was accepted
and placed on file.
J. W. Titcomb, the treasurer, re
ported receipts of cash on hand $15.
78, membership and dues $609.32, for
spraying $76.35, borrowed money
$200.00, from towns $1,162.92, and
How Do You Like Dt?
Some folks consider an Insurance Agent a nuisance. They allow
if they want any Insurance, they can go after it, but they seldom do this.
I write all kinds of Insurance' an4 am glad to do it, but I do not
personally solicit business from any one. Should be glad to have you
call at my office, where I can show you more intelligently, just what
I can do for you, or will call on you upon request, either by Phone,
374-l', or by card. I claim to have the very best of all kinds and
cheaper than many companies.

He said that the total expenses for
a year averaged about $3,300.00, but
they had not been quite so large for
the past few months as under the
former management. This leaves
about $900.00 to be provided for by
dues and subscriptions. There was
money enough In the treasury at the
present time to run the organization'
for two or three months.
County Agent Wood then gave his
report which he said was necessarily
brief and incomplete as he had been
connected with the station for only
four months. He spoke of the spray
ing demonstrations on oats for killing
