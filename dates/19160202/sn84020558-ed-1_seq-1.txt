NORFOLK, Feb. 1. Given up
for lost days ago, the British pas- !
scnger liner Appam, plying in the
West African trade, sailed like an
apparition into Hampton Roads
today flying the German naval en
sign and with her ship's company
under guard of a German prize
crew. She brought word of a mys
terious German commerce raider,
the Moewe, which now roams the
seas, and she had on board the
crews of seven British merchant
men and admiralty transports cap
tured by the Moewe before she
seized the Appam and strted her
across the Atlantic for an Amer
ican port with Lieutenant Hans
Bercje of the German naval reserve
and twenty-two men in charge.
The Appam now lies off Old
Point Comfort, under the guns of
Fortress Monroe, waiting for the
state department at Washington to
determine her status whether she
is a man-of-war subject to intern
ment or a German prize. By to
morrow the customs authorities
here hope to have orders to send
the ship either to Norfolk or New-"
port News, where the anxiously
waiting British civilians will be
put ashore.

Naval officers generally agreed that
to accomplish any continued effective

marine to Irave a base of supplies

was pointed out, of some audacious

with the futility of messap.es and words
of protests to meet breaches of inter

'Why, to ask that rpiestion is to an
swer it," he said. ' Whenever interna

"America was called upon to register
: 'voice of protest, of insistence.'
"I.v, you want the situation to be such
that all the president can do i.s to write
messages and utter words of protest?"
he continued. "If these breaches of in

1 he president's address was punctu
ated with thunderous applause, lie

phatic gestures to enforce his words.
His declaration that the United
States wanted peace dtevv a quick re
sponse and his assertion that the self
respect of the nation must be preserved,
t'.icitcd another great demonstration.
The president declared he was trying
to weigh carefully every word he said.
He reitt rated that he had been daily
charged to keep '.he country out of war
anil also to uphold il;i honor.
' And many a night when it has

said, "because of the apparently inex

"'.Mr. Chairman, Your Fxcollency,
and fellow citizens:
"I am gieatly cheered as well as
greatly honored by the sight of this
great audience. 1 have been very
much impressed by being told that
you have been waiting here patiently
for more than two hours foivthe ex
ercises of the evening, and I think I
know. I hope I know, what that means.
It is not only that, in your gracious
courtesy, you have waited to greet
the president of the I'nited States,
but that, knowing the errand upon
which he has come, you are pro
foundly interested, as he is, in the
candid discussion of some nf the chief
things whieh concern the welfare and
the safety of the nation.
"Some one who does not know our
fellow citizens quite as well as he
ought to know them, told me there
was a certain degree of indifference"
and lethargy in the middle west with
ngard to the defense of the nation.
I said. 'I do not. believe it, but I am
going out to see.' And I have seen.
I have seen what I expected to see
great bodies of serious men. great
bodies of earnest women com
ing together to show their profound
interest in the objects of this visit of
mine. And 1 know, therefore, that it
is my privilege to address those who
will" icalize the spirit of responsi
bilitv in which I speak to you.
"My fellow citizens, it would be
easy if I permitted myself to do so.
to draw a. picture of the present situ
ation of the world, whieh would deeply
stir your feelings and perhaps deeply
excite your apprehension, but you
would not think that it was right
for your chief magistrate to speak any
word of excitement whatever. I
want you to believe that in what 1
say to you I am endeavoring as far
as extemporaneous speech will permit,
to weigh every word that I say. I
said a moment ago that you know
the errand upon which I have come
to you. hut do you know the reasons
why 1 have undertaken that errand?
There are some very conclusive, and
imperative reasons. Some of our fel
low citizens are seeking to darken
counsel upon this great matter; not,

motives, but certainly I believe out
