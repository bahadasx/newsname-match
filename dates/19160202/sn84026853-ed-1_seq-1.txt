APPROPRIATION BILL
! LESS THIS TIME
MEASURE SENT IN BY CHAIRMAN
LILES EARLIER THAN
EVER BEFORE.
Colombia, January 29.?Special:
The general appropriation bill went
into the House to-day and Chairman
Liles has the distinction of having introduced
this most important measure
earlier than it has ever before
been presented. The committee members,
Chief Clerk Malcolm Miller and
Mr. J. C. Townsend, chief clerk of
the engrossing department, all work- I
e with persistency to get the bill into |
the House to-day so that it could be
ready for consideration on Monday,
ing with persistency to get the bill in
that it provides for a tax levy of 6
mills, which is to cover all of the expenses
of the State Government. Notwithstanding
the very heavy demands
the appropriation bill shows a net
reduction in the total of $79,260.80.
It will be interesting to note how
continuously the appropriation bill
has hang around the two million dollar
mark. These figures will be interesting:
1914 _$2,213,675.54 .

It is very much easier- to undertake
to make reductions in an appropriation
bill than it is to accomplish
this.
Chairman Liles in a talk with the
newspaper men after the introduction
of the bill had this comment to
make:
Liles'c Comment.
"The committee has faithfully endeavored
to serve the best interest of
the State. We did not appropriate in
accordance without desires, but we
believe we appropriated as the condition
of the State's finances justified.
The most careful consideration has
been given every Hem and we feel j
sore that the actual needs of every
department and every institution ;
have Been supplied, and we think we ;
have provided funds for extension
and imnrovements where the needs ;
for stich were great. The work of
the committee has been absolutely ;
harmonious. All differences were
settled in the committee room and
ire are readv to stand bv our work.
I cannot speak too highly of the
faitkfnlness of the members of the
committee. It has been a dav and j
night job since January 11. We are
hopeful that the results of our efforts
will prove satisfactory to the people ;
of the State. It will be noted that ;
for ordinary State purposes we have
aupropriated less than $2,000,000.
The amount for pensions and for the
improvement of the State Hospital
for the Insane, increases the total as
shown. We have carried out the
resolution of the committee to keep
the amount raised by levy within ,
$2,000,000 and have reduced the
levy one-half mill."
The appropriation bill is a very <
long document, consisting of fortytwo
itemized sections, but the following
recapitulation will show where !
the committee expects the State to
use its funds.

WOULD LEND MONEY 6
FOR THEIR TUITION
FIGHT ON FREE TUITION AND RI
SCHOLARSHIPS TAKES NEW
ANGLE IN SENATE.
Columbia, January 28.?Special:
The fight on free tuition and scholar- gj
ships in State colleges was given an- frj
other angle to-day when Senator ^
Verner introduced in the Senate a m(
bill appropriating $50,000 for the
purpose of loaning to needy students jjand
abolishing the present scholar- en
ships and tuition. Under the bill
the money will be divided between ca
boys and girls, and one applying for m.
it must get a certificate signed by jjj
two neighbors and the cashier of |^r
their home bank that they are unable m(
to pay tuition. The students who
qualifies can go to any college, either
denominational or State, as they
wish. The ones getting the money W
are to give their notes endorsed by no
their parents or guardians and the de
notes are to be repaid to the State Cc
when the student quits college either ca
at graduation or otherwise. It is La
further provided it tne student is
not doing good work he or she is lia- kn
ble to be dismissed and must then wi
repay their tuition. pa
The amount to be loaned to any .
one student is limited to $12 per
month, and not over $100 in one
year. The requirements for eligibility
to compete fcr this loan is very W(
stringent.
The bill was referred to the com- co
mittee on education, of which Senator

FOR HIGH COURT
^FORMER SUCCEEDS LAMAR?
BRANDEIS KNOWN AS 'POOR
MAN'S FRIEND.'
Washington, Jan. 29.?Louis D.
ancleis is known as the "poor man's
iend." Years ago he announced
at he was through trying to make
sney. It was estimated then that
had less than a quarter of a miln
dollars. But he declared it was
ough.
He has defended poor people in
ses in the Massachusetts courts
iny times without remuneration.
i is a leader in the movement to
ing the Jews in Kussia and Ar2nia
back to Palestine.
Washington, Jan. 29.?President
ilson to-day sent to the Senate the
mination of Louis Dembitz Branis,
of Boston, to be Supreme
>urt justice to fill the vacancy
used by the death of Joseph Rucker
imar.
Mr. Brandeis always has been
own as an independent in politics,
th leanings toward the Democratic
rty.
Mr. Brandeis is the first man of
wish nationality to be named to
e Supreme Court bench.
He is well known in the legal
>rld. Since 1897, when he became
nior member of Brandeis, Dunbar
Nutter, he has been prominently
tirifVi monv imnnrtnnt lit
llil^CbCU vt&wi iiiuiiJ
ations, including the Ballinger-Pinot
investigation. He was also
airman of the board of arbitration
the big garment workers' strike
New York in 1910. He was counI
for the shippers in the advanced
eight rate investigation before the
terstate Commerce Commission;
was counsel for the people in the
oceedings involving the constitu nality
of the Oregon and Illinois
n-hour laws for women.
Mr. Brandeis is 59 years old.
Mr. Brandeis was bon November
, 1856, at Louisville, Ky. He obined
his early education in the
blic and high schools there and
;er went abroad, where he attended
men Real Schule at Dresden, Ger
Ill y. JUfllCl ilC r? V.11U vv,
iere he obtained his law degree in
77. The following year he was adtted
to the bar.
Prominent among the number of
le lawyers who were indorsed for
e appointment were Alex C. King,
Atlanta; Judge Horace M. Holden,
Athens, Ga.; Judge Henry D.
ayton, of Eufaula, Ala.; Judge
hn L. Kelly, of Bristol, Va., and
rmer President Taft.
\NY SOUTHERNERS FEEL THE
RESIDENT MADE MISTAKE IN
NOT NAMING TAFT.
Washington, January 28.?Special
> s?iv that Congress and official
ashington generally were astonishat
the nomination of Louis D.
andeis, of Boston, to succeed the
;e Justice Lamar, of Georgia, as
isociate Justice of the United States
ipreme Court is putting it mildly.
:w favorable comnemts. were heard.
While there have been very few re:tic>ns
of nominations for the Sueme
Court, it seems at this time
at ;he chances are heavily against
e confirmation of Mr. Brandeis. He
recognized everywhere as a man
remarkable ability, but he is rerded
as radically Socialistic in his
nvictions and as of an eminently
n-judicial temperament. Except
r his radicalism he would probably
ve the best of the outlook for con
mation, but with this against him
appears to have an uphill journey,
any Southerners here feel that the
esident made a mistake in not apinting
Ex-President Taft and they
nerally think that there was much
tter Democratic material in sight
an Mr. Brandeis.
The only rejections recorded since
e Civil War are those of Caleb
ishing and George H. Williams,
10 were successively turned down
len nominated by President Grant
be Chief Justice, and of William
Hornblower and Wheeler H. Peck;m,
who successively met the same
te when nominated for Associate
istice by President Cleveland,
rant succeeded the third time with
lief Justice Waite, and Cleveland
cceeded the third time with Senar
White, of Louisiana, now Chief
istice.
The next notch on the Senate's
ick seems about to be cut.

TILLMAN PRAISES
SECRETARY DANIELS
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR j
SAYS HE IS GREATEST CHIEF
NAVY HAS EVER HAD.
Washngton, January 29.?Secretary
Daniels was praised as "one of '
the greatest Secretaries the navy (
ever had, and former Secretary Mey- i
er was assailed to-day by Chairman (
Tillman, of the Senate naval com- r
mittee, in a speech on "The Truth 1
About the Navy." (
Senator Tillman took Mr. Meyer ?
to task for his recent declaration be- 1
fore the National Security League
that "the fundamental defect of the
navy department is that it has no r
brain and no competent military or- j
ganization."
"Mr. Meyer forgets," said Senator i
m:ii n:r u~ 1?4-U?4
| J. mnian, 11 ne evei tvucw, uiai> uic
| time he left the navy department the
I service was nearly six thousand short
! of the authorized enlisted complejment;
that forty-six per cent of the
!men discharged in good standing
jwere then leaving the navy, while
eighty-five per cent are now re-enilisting;
that during his incumbency
there were 10,360 desertions.
Needed Men, Too.
"Mr. Meyer needed men and did
the best he knew how to get them,
land yet he left the navy nearly six
thousand short. Yet he has the
cheek to hold his successor responsible
for conditions which are due
wholly to his own short-comings as
Secretary. Everyone knows officers
cannot be enlisted like sailors. It
takes four years to make an officer.
Is Mr. Daniels responsible if the Republicans
in Congress failed to supply
the cadets at Annapolis to graduate?
"It may be nccessary to quarter
midshipmen in tents, for the Naval j
Academy will be filled to overflowing (
if the recommendations of Secretary
Daniels are adopted by Congress. The ^
j emergency is too pressing, in my ,
opinion, to wait for any building pro- ?
gramme at all. J
"I mySelf would like to see three
midshipmen for each Senator and t
Congressman instead of two. But j
surely no sensible, honest man can <
blame the present Secretary for the
shortage in officers. .
"Not only has the authorized en- j
listment long since been obtained,
but there is a large waiting list.
There is less envy and jealousy ]
among the naval officers and more
efficient cc-operation and co-ordination
of the whale department than '
I have ever seen in it before. *As
against 10,360 desertions while Mr.
Meyer was Secretary, there have
( D66F1 only 4,07 O S1I1CC ilia outvcoovji j
entered office. ]
No Pampered Son. ^
"The head of the navy himself is ]
not a pampered and petted darling of j
inherited wealth, but a red-blooded, ?
upstanding, forward-looking Ameri- ?
can, who is a graduate in the hard i
school of experience and a practical ?
man, with wholesome ideas. His re- i
ligion, in a political sense, is that the
door of opportunity shall be thrown 1
wide open so that every man may ]
have an equal chance to rise as high
as his hopes and merits entitle him 1
to. I predict that Josephus Daniels j
will go down in history as one of the i
~ i - - iL. J
greatest secretaries mc navy n?o i
ever had. Paying no attention to \
political or social influences, he has j
selected as his lieutenants as brilliant
a group of officers as the naval ser- 1
vice affords. j
"Although the navy department ]
has no 'brains' since Von L. Meyer '
was forced to go by the people, there j
still remains Admiral George Dewey, j
I admired throughout the world both t
1 for his ability as a naval officer and
his thorough knowledge gathered in
the school of experience of the navy
in all its details. His services in
Manila Bay will never be forgotten i
by the American people. He illus- ]
trated to the fullest the heroism of j
I American commanders, commencing 1
'with John Paul Jones and coming <
down through the long list of naval 1
heroes whom every American loves 1
to honor. i
"Full eight months before Mr. ]
Meyer delivered his remarkable la- <
ment over the utter absence of con- :
crete war plans there was established i
the office of naval operations for the
purpose of meeting exactly that need
and the duties and responsibilities
1 -J? A-P navg] '
ana autnorny ui m?= kmu ?.?. ? ,
operations embrace all the advan- :
tages of an Americanized general j
staff, without any of the dangerous
disadvantages which Mr Meyer would J
import- from Prussia." ,
Praise for Others. ]
Senator Tillman also praised Rear ,
Admiral Benson, chief of naval oper- j
ations, "who is not known at all in 1
| the drawing rooms in Washington or (
Newport;" Rear Admi^l Victor j
Blue, chief of the bureau of naviga- j
tion, and Rear Admiral Joseph j
Strauss, head of the bureau of ordi- ?
nancc. ]
"While Germany had already won j
second place, as shown in Von Mey- :
er's first reports, he never could ]
persuade his party to grant money
! enough to recover the lost ground," j
'continued Senator Tillman. His pre- <
decessor, Mr. Metcalf, notified the <
country that we could not hold second i
place without more drcadnaughts and :
Von Meyer's first report notified us ,
that we were already displaced. His ]
report for 1909, four years before I
his political demise, admits this. It I

BANNING SENDS MESSAGE o
ON LAURENS NIGHT SCHOOL ?
d
Columbia, January 28.?Special:
aovernor Manning to-day sent a mes- n
sage to the Senate concerning the p
vork done at the night school at the r
uaurens Cotton Mill. With the mes- q
lage the Governor transmitted two
icore letters written by pupils of the
ichool, showing appreciation of the ?
vork and indicating the beneficial results
of the splendid effort. The
nessage reads as follows: f
State of South Carolina, Executive
Chamber, Columbia, January 28, ?
1916. *
Gentlemen of the General Assemjly:
I have the honor to transmit t
herewith exact copies of letters (ori- ^
finals of which are filed in this of- t
ice,) from night school pupils at
the Laurens Mill School. I ask a
;hat you read these letters. c
Money spent in providing educa:ional
facilities for our people is an ^
nvestment which will bring a rich
/?iti7pnchin.
I CLUI 11 III ail ^UUVUbvu
The work that is being accomplished
in these night schools has already j
proven its value, and I commend it
.0 your favorable consideration.
Very respectfully,
Richard I. Manning, Governor.
a
s true the programme he recom- ,
mended that year was quite respect- ?
able in size, but his party associates, ^
who are now clamoring for the Demo- ?
crats to make good Republican deficiencies
in a naval programme, did 11
not give him the money. So that it
is proven beyond possibility of dis- ?
pute that the Republican party is r
solely responsible for our present J
status?lack of officers, lack of personnel
and lack of ships. .
Makes a Difference. j
"It makes a great difference whether a
one is on the inside looking out of t
whether he is in on the outside look- s
ing in. When Mr. Von L. Meyer was a
in authority and must, perforce, an- e
swer to the American people for t
money spent by his department, he e
was whining about the 'economical p
limit set for the navy' and was using v
constantly such words as 'the department
recommends only.' Now
that he is on the outside, a partisan ^
desirous of displacing the responsible
administration, which is recommending
a consistent and contiuous building
programme, such as was con- ^
stantly urged upon Mr. Von L. Meyer j(
he is assuming the attitude of a carping
and unreasoning critic, finding a
fault with others who succeed where
lie himself failed.
"The onlv act which signalized his ?
incumbency as Secretary was the
closing of a few navy yards and recammending
the abandonment of
others. In view of all these facts j
it is safe to predict that the name of _
Josephus Daniels will be held in
grateful memory by the United
Stages navy long after Mr. Von L. v
Meyer has been forgotten." T
ISDN URGES QUICK
ACTION ,j
3
/ARNS THAT DANGERS ARE j
"INFINITE AND CONSTANT."
i
Cleveland, Jan. 29.?The necessiY
for quick action was made the
eynote of President Wilson's prearedness
addresses in Pittsburgh
nd Cleveland on the first day of his
'eek's tour of the middle.west. Delaring
that "we are in the midst of
world we did not make and cannot
Iter," he said it was his duty to
lform the people that dangers are
infinite and constant."
New circumstances, he said, had
risen which made it necessary that
lis country prepare itself not for
far nor aggression but for adequate
ationai deiense. America's neglect
> build merchant ships )tad left the
ountry dependent on other neutrals
3 carry United States commerce and
rhere ordinary rules of commerce at
ea were apt to be thrust aside "there
: danger of a more critical kind of
ontroversy."
Saying that people who come to
tie White House assert that the naion
is counting on him to rkeep the
foiled States at peace and in the
ame breath insist that fee maintain
tie honor of the United States. The
'resident asked, "Have you reflected
bat the time might come when I
ould not do both? Are you ready to
tand behind the government for the
... iL. 1 - ?
laiiibciiuiiue u? cue nunur ui yuur
ountry?"
He criticised the advocates of
peace at any price" and also advoated
a large standing army. Naional
defense, he explained, was not
party matter, saying he was soit^
tie issue arose in a presidential
ampaign year because of the danger
bat politics might cloud it.
Congress, he said, would do its
art but the issue really lay with
he young men who should volunteer
nd their employers who should
ot hinder, them from responding.
The president spoke at two meetlgs
today at Pittsburgh and one
jnight at Gray's Armory here. He
rill spend Sunday in Cleveland, <
saving at midnight for Milwaukee
3 speak there Monday.
In his speech tonight the presient
spoke with greater gravity than
larked the others. "America is not
fraid of anybody," he said, "the on/
thing I'm afraid of is the danger
f inadequacy. Let me tell you
olemnly you cannot postpone this
tiing. I do not know what a single
ay may bring forth."
For the first time he spoke of the
avy and coast defenses. He said exerts
agree the United States navy
anks fourth and defenses good in
uality but "not" quantity.
Ixcerpts From Speech
by Wil?on at Cleveland
I suppose this country has never
ound itself before in so singular a
iosition. * * * Two-thirds of the
forld are at war. All the world
utside of America is on fire. *
'his is a struggle which will do*
ermine the history of the world, I
are say, for more than a century
o come.
The world will never be the same
gain after this war is over. The

ipon you, Mr. President, to keep us
ut of this war, but we are relying
ipon you to keep the honor of the
iation unstained."
You may count upon my heart
,nd resolution to keep you out of
he war, but you must be ready if
t is necessary that I should mainain
your honor.
We are, interested in knowing
hat there are men all over the
Jnited States prepared, equipped
,nd ready to go out at the call of
he National Government upon the
hortest possible notice. You will
,sk me, "Why do you say the shortst
possible notice?" Because, genlemen,
let me tell you very solmnly,
you cannot _afford to post
