WARREN
r" issmg of a Noble Pioneer.
yore E. Moulton, the well
1 and highly esteemed Warren
jc, whose death occured at the
city liospital on Jan. 25th, after a
several weeks' siege of pneumonia,
was born at Portage City, Wis., on
Jan. 3, 1856. He had, therefore, just
completed his sixtieth year when the
final summons came. His boyhood
and young manhood was spent in
Wisconsin.
In 1879 or 1880, deceased came, to
gether with L. M. Rafferty, to work
on the Snake River Farm, then being
opened up by F. W. Woodward. It is
said that he brought the first carload
of mules for said farm, on which he
was employed for a number of years
afterward, either on the farm or in
charge of the farm's elevator in town.
After that he was in the employ of
the Warren Mfg. Co. at the old mill
for some years, and next with the
Barclay Milling Company at Fergus
Falls and West Superior, Wis., for
some time. He was next in charge of
an elevator in Erskine for a year,
after which he returned to Warren to
work again at the Snake River Farm.
In 1905 he became the agent of the
Spaulding Elevator Company at
March and has remained there faith
fully at his post ever since until
pneumonia compelled him to take to
his bed
A very prominent trait or charac
teristic of deceased was his faithful
ness in the discharge of duty. He
never shirked his work. He was as
honest as the day is long and always
endeavored to give everybody with
whom he had business relations a
square deal. He enjoyed the confi
dence of the farmers, who were hid
patrons, to a remarkable degree, and
the company will not easily find a
man to take his place.
Mr. Moulton was married to Miss
Rena Rear, in this city, on Nov. 10,
1885. She died Dec. 23, 1904 and is
buried here.
To this union two children were
born. The son Charles R. Moulton,
after graduating from the Warren
high school went west and is now a
practicing attorney at Oregon City,
Oregon. He came here during his
father's illness and stayed with him
until his eyes were closed in death
The daughter, now Mrs. E. B. Pel
land, is also a graduate from the
Warren hrghrschooL ,Her home ,ie4$'
Pelland, near InternationalFalls. She
was with her" father rfor some time
during his illness, but had returned to
her home when the final summons
came.
Besides the two children mentioned
above, an aged aunt, Miss Amelia
Moulton, who has stayed with de
ceased at March, a brother, Lewis D.
Moulton, of McMinnville, Oregon, and
two sisters, Miss Eva L. Moulton, of
Oregon City, Ore., and Mrs. S. A.
Finley, of Dalton, Ga are the immed
iate mourners.
The funeral was held from the
Presbyterian church on Thursday af
ternoon and was attended by many
old neighbors and friends who had
come to pay their last respects to one
whom in life they had learned to love
and esteem. An impressive funeral
discourse was preached by Rev. D.
Samson. The floral offerings were
very profuse.
The community extends its sincere
sympathy to those who are left to
mourn. A good man and a useful
citizen has gone to his rest, after
work well done. Long live his mem
ory! RED RIVER DISTRICT

The Whittier society held a regular
meeting last Saturday evening in
which time a well prepared program
was rendered.
Our boys suffered defeat at the
hands of the Stephen boys on Friday
evening and could not keep pace with
the Thief River Falls aggregation on
Saturday afternoon. The latter team
would evidently have been defeated
had our boys been heavier in weight.
The faculty entertained in honor of
the students at the college last Mon
day evening At least 125 partook in
this reception and from what we have
heard all enjoyed the evening with
the faculty. A complete story of the
reception will be found elsewhere in
this paper.
Three students enrolled last Mon
day, and two last Saturday. We wel
come these students to partake of the
work and the pleasures offered at our
school.
We have already received encourag
ing letters as well as donations from
the Alumni. We hope to be able to
report $2,000 for the building fund
from the Alumni alone. Please do
not forget us with a letter soon in
answer to the one we have written
you. Give us a lift now and you will
feel that you are doing something
really worth while for your Alma
Mater.
Next Tuesday evening Miss Her
manson and Miss Anderson will ren
der a program in the Swedish Luther
an, church of Alvarado. The program
will begin at 7:30.
Mr and Mrs. Wood and
daughter Mildred and Mr and Mrs.

many relatives and friends. But they
wiU also endeavor to see everything
that is worth
':a before th*y**eti_- to Finnf-s-sta

GHOSTS!
The Film Version of Ibsen's Immortal
Story at Dreamland Tuesday Night
"Ghosts" is a stirring plea for puri
ty of thought and deed. This vivid
Ibsen play portrays, in compelling
scenes, the inevitable results of im
morality and drives home the great
question of heredity and responsibility
of the parents. Ghosts is a wonder
ful, truthful and artistic film pro
duction produced in five acts and fea

GREAT FARM CROPS
SHOW NEXT WEEK.
Farmers of Marshall County Will
Make History at the
Crookston Show.
The big Farm Crops Show for
which the farmers of Marshall county
have been preparing for weeks will
open at Crookston Monday, and con
tinue all throughout the week. This
show is a sort of annual clearing
house, showing the steady progress
the farmers of the Minnesota Red
River Valley are making from year to
year along the line of better seed sel
ection, diversification, crop rotation,
corn etc
In addition to the magnificent ex
hibits, the program each day will
comprise a galaxy of speakers of na
tion wide reputation, practical men
talking on subjects which they have
made their life study.
Wednesday, Good Roads Day, will
bring together, the biggest crowd
ever assembled to discuss good roads
problems and more unified efforts
along that line will result.
Saturday, Poultry Day, will also
witness a gathering of Valley editors
who have labored unselfishly in the
better farming movement, devoting
unlimited space to this movement, and
every other movement that tended to
build up their community. The ed
itors will be given a luncheon at the
Crookston Commercial Club Rooms
at noon.
Let Marshall county be well repre
sented during the week at the Farm
Crops Show, and may the farmers re
turn with their full share of the
prizes.

NORTH STAR COLLEGE LOSES
W 0 FAST GAMES.
Stephen H. S, 31 North Star 1(5.
The North Star Collesre basket ball
quint met the fast Stephen high
school loop shooters on the college
gymnasium floor Friday evening.
The game was interesting and hotly
contested by both teams but the
visitors had it all over the college
boys in fast team work and seemed
to have their men placed in every di
rection of the hall. The weak point
in the collegians style of playing was
their poor attempt at pass work. In
the first half the score was 14 to 8
in Stephen's favor but in the second
half the visitors seemed to have
pretty much their own way in hand
ling the sphere and as a result the
score ended with Stephen in the lead.
Thief River H. S. 33 North Star 13.
On Saturday afternoon the crack
high school organization from Thief
River Falls came down and plucked a
victory at the expense of the College
team. The Thief River boys were
faster and heavier than the collegians,
but their ability to shoot baskets did
not come up to the standard of the
college team. In the first half the
score was 9 to 12 in the visitors' fav
or and showed that the North Star
ites put up a scrappy game. In the
second half the Thief River bunch
went in with a rush and completely
took the collegians off their feet and
run up 21 points to their 4. This
made the total score 33 to 13 in Thief
River Falls favor
Though the college team has made
no remarkable showing this season it
has developed material for a fast
team next year.

COST BIG AMOUNT
TO OPERATE STATE.
That it cost $22,600,458 to run
the state of Minnesota in all its de
partments last year is shown by the
annual report of J. A. O. Preus, state
auditor, the expense amounting to $83
more than the total income. The re
port which gives a list of expendi
tures and resources of income, shows
that the amounts paid in by the coun
ties and by the railroads in gross
earnings taxes make the two largest
sources of revenue. The share f
taxes of the state paid in the counties
was $6,859,210 and from the railroads
it obtained $4,938,368.
The rest of the money which kept
up the public school aid, built roads,
paid salaries and did all the other
things that a state has to do came
from special taxes, fees for service
state officials, royalties from ore
school lands.
The state sold 79,485 acres of land
last year for $560,911. The lands
averaged $7 per acre. The largest
land sales were in Aitkin county,
where 22,922 acres were sold and the
smallest sales were in Wabasha coun
ty, one of the oldest counties in the
state, where only 40 acres were put
on the block. Itasca was second ia
the number of acres of state land
sold, 12,698.81 acres being purchased.
The land brought $84,830-40.
