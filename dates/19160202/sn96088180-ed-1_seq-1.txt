Captured Liner Is Said by
Naval Advisers to Be the
Captor's Game, and Should
Be Interned Till War Ends
Washington, Fob. 2. The naval
neutrality board recommended to the
iiUte di'imrtnifiil thin afternoon that
the British liner Appam, at Norfolk,
bo considered ft prlxo of war and not
a converted auxiliary cruiser.
If tho state department accepts thin
advice, the Appam can bo Interned
and restored to Germany after tho
war. At tho name time this would
protect the owner through lessening
tho likelihood thut tho vessel would
attempt to dash to aoa.
Moreover It would give thorn an op
portunity to urgo their claim until
the government was nblo to make
final dolslon.
Norfolk, Va., Fob. 2. 8natchd

crow after being given up for lost,
(ho big British African liner Appam
rode at anchor today while both Brit

Involved In It wan the question of
whether tho Appam la German prl
vnteer, nuhjoct to internment, or a
prlxo, subject either to Internment or
release to the Brlttnh owners.
The long hulk of tho ship was dim
ly aeen from shoro, bobbing In tho
fog and rain. Aboard her, 450 Brit
ish prisoners, In charge of 42 Ger
mans, awaited permission to go
ashore, and It was anticipated that
the vessel would go soon to Newport
Neva to dlschargo non-combatants.
Communication with the ship was
strictly prohibited, and meantime I
port officials kept a guard on board
to maintain irtatus quo between Ocr
man and British subjects.
Lieut. Berg, Gvrmnn
commander
n charge of tho prlxo crew, gave evi
dence that the Moewe which captured
tho Appnm and seven other craft was
not a regular war craft, hut an aux
iliary reserve. Much depends, too,
upon what classification Is given tho
Appam. The situation presented' toy

Tacoma, Feb. 2. The heaviest and
most continuous snow storms expert
eacod in this section of the Pacific

with railroad and street car trans
portation, prostrated telephone and
telegraph wires and created a condi

Dynamite has boen resorted to In
the Cascado mountains to break up

From the tone of the telegram it
Is evident that the seed situation has
been solved, and that all who wish
to plant beets can be accommodated.
Those who are unable to make nve-
year contracts can also be taken care
of with one-year contracts, thus mak

that could not fee otherwise planted.
This feature in the new contracts will
bring several hundred more acres in
to beet production in the vicinity of
Grants Pass this spring.
In Tacoma snow Is falling heavily
and over a foot of it now covers the
ground. . A strong northeast wind is

WILSON'S ICE
Topeka, Kas., Feb. 2. Hailed by
Governor Capper as the man who has
"eat undismayed upon the hottest
lid since Lincoln's time," President
Wilson spoke here this afternoon to
5,000 persons crammed in the audi
torium. And the crowd that had
braved tero weather to hear about
preparedness voiced approval of the
governor's "Kansas admires that kind
of grit," by a mighty roar of ap
plause. Other thousands outside
battled to gain admission to the ball,
already Jammed, even in the aisles,
but upon being promised an. overflow
meeting at the high school, retired
there. .
The scene as the president and the
governor shook hands was stirring.
Hundreds of American flags, released
from the top of the hall, fluttered
overhead, while the crowd broke
forth in enthusiasm.
"Tou will realize," said Wilson at
the outset, "that it is because I have
felt it my imperative duty to assist
in clarifying Judgment and to sweep
away things irrelevant and untrue,
that I came from Washington. I
want you to understand that every
day is critical while the great con
flict across the water endures. '
, , "Everywhere throughout America
there are combustibles and ft is easy
to start a fire when the air la fuU of
sparks. It has been our desire, how
ever, to see that these sparks do not
touch the magazines.
, "Tlie loudest voices opposed to na
tional defense have been the irre
sponsible ones. It is easy to talk and
to say bow things ought to be done,
when you do not have to do them. I
have not bad soldiers enough to pa
trol the Mexican border, nor enough
soldiers to do the president's duty un
der certain conditions."
At this point Wilson was inter
rupted by the din of the crowd trying
to storm the doors, but police clubbed
the leaders into silence, after a few
moments.
"Some one is too eager for nation
al defense, I guess," commented the
president, smilingly, as he resumed.
"I bave come to tell you that the
difficulties of our foreign negotiations
daily increase Jn seriousness, delicacy
and danger. And, for one thing, It
may be the duty of the United States
to use Its Instrumentalities."
