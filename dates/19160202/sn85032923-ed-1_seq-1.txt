SAN DIEGO.- Jan. 31. United
States marines reported that they
caught four white men looting in the
Otay valley. Two were lodged with
the civil authorities and the otners
driven from the district at the point
of bayonets. Sheriff Conklin, who re
turned today from the Otay and Tia
Juana valleys, reported that the ser
vices of himself and deputies were
hot nteded 'as" ffit: -Ta"M ToVcTJsl'wcr e
ample to copy with any emergency.
He declared that the reports of arm
ed Mexicans engaged in looting were
exaggerated. No further casualties
were reported and no more identifica
tions. The amount of wreckage and de
bris in San Diego bay has impaired
the water system here and caused the
city council to make arrangements
with a prh-atc water concern. The
pipe line 'break clogged the conduits
and shut off the supply from the
Moreno and Upper Otay reservoirs.
The Chamber of Commerce commit
tee continued its relief work in con
junction with the naval authorities,
while the city officials discussed the
rebuilding of the Lower Otay dam.
The Chamber of Commerce commit
tee announced that $100,000 is needed.
The fund is now $30,000. County
Superintendent West recommended
that the schools in the affected dis
trict be closed a month, when it is be
lieved the roads -will be re-opened.;
The food shortage will be relieved to
morrow with the arrival of steamers
bringing belated shipments of beef
and vegetables. The Santa Fe re
ported that it will take three weeks
to repair its line to Los Angeles, ow
ing to several bridges having been
washed out. Several extra vessels
arc being run to San Pedro, thus
eliminating northern runs until the
railway re-opens.
J. A. Pierce, an automobile dealc:
at El Cajon, who arrived here today,
said practically every ranch in the
San Diego valley between Foster and
Lakeside, twenty miles northeast of
here was swept clean by the waters
which rushed through the valley
Thursday. He reported similar con
ditions at El Monte, in the same district.
