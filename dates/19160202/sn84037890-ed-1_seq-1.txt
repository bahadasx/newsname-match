.Conditions Are Creating
Much Suffering.
aX APPEAL FOR AH) ISSUED
Kvansvlllo, Ind., Jan. 30. The
Ohio river continued to riso hero
.-and Into this afternoon passed tho
danger line, registering at 35.C feet.
This is a riso of 2.C feet in twenty
.four hours. Considerable driftwood
has started to pass here. Rain fell
in this section this afternoon for
about two hours, and indications aro
that it will continuo during tho
night. Th0 majority of rlvcrmen
.aro of the opinion that a stago of
about 44 feet will be reached on tho
present rise. This will be 9 feet
ibovo the danger line.
Pigeon creek, which flows through
Jhe western part of tho city, is ris
ing rapidly and much of the low.
'ands north of the city have been
hooded. At Cypress, Ind., on the
thlo river ten miles below here, all
vestock and valuables have been
loved from places where they
vould be affected by 4C feet of wa
ter. Many farmers down stream aro
engaging boats to move their house
liold effects. It is believed that tho
territory between Mt. Vernon, Ind.,
and Shawneetown, 111., is likely to
suffer the most daniago due to tho
Iieavy rains. The Government lev.
es at Shawneetown have been
strengthened lately under a stage of
48 feet at that place.
Reports received hero to-day from
Rockport, Ind., and Boonevllle, Ind.,
say that thousands of acres have
been flooded by tho heavy rains of
the past three days. Tho Wabash
Tiver at Mt. Camel, 111., which fell
3 feet during the past week, has
started to riso again and Is expected
to go over the danger mark In tho
Illinois town. Tho rains along the
Wabash Valley during tho past twen
tjtffour hours have been heavy. A
stage . of a trifle over 22 feet was
reached at Mt. Carmel on the recent
rise.
a Hickman Alarmed.
VUckm.an, Ky., Jan. 30. Tho riv
er conditions are more alarming to
night than any tlmo before with the
river rising very rapidly, coming up
about seven inches every twenty.
four hours, the river now being
eight Inches higher than It was two
weeks ago and tho water' wouM bo
coming across tho levqe in many
places if it were not for sandbags
A force of men worked all day to
day on tho leveo strengthening it
and getting everything in readiness
for the flght that m.iist be made.
They aro working t'Ao-nlght. Tho
leveo has only one i yak place. This
gave trouble to-day,j but tho leveo
otherwise Is in fine condition.
Tho C. & St. L. 'railroad moved
out Its offices late fjo-day to East
Hickman, one mile and a half east
of town, moving telr passenger
train and every freight car in order
that nothing might lie caught on the
railroad part of the leveo should the
leveo let go. Sovenil thousand bags
are being shipped in. to-night, also a
tralnload of sand cnd work will
continuo. Water is to-night backing
through sowers up Into the business
section.
AVater Pours Over Levee.
Hickman, Ky., Jan. 31. The Mis
sissippi river here roso ten Inches
during the night ind at 4 o'clock
this morning poured over tho top of
the West Hickman' leveo, inundating
hundreds of homes and several fac
tories. Fifteen hundred people are
liomeless and 800 men thrown out
of work.
Within a few hours tho leveo had

placing sandbags along Its entire
length, and although tho embank
ment held Arm, tho yellow wnters of
the river rose so rapidly that the
forces of workmen could not build
up the dike fast enough.
Early this morning the wnters of
fho Mississippi river wero entering
business section of Hickman, which
Is on considerably higher ground
than Inundated West Hickman,
which, save for a few factories in
tho shelter of the levee, is a resi
dential section.
Tho Cincinnati, Memphis and Gulf
railroad depot and tracks for a dis
tance of two miles are under water,
while tho Nashville, Chattanooga
and St. Louis railroad stops a mile
outsldo of the city.
Tho water went over the levee In
1012 and 1913 and this year there
nro four feet more water than in
1913, when West Hickman was
flooded.
The factories under water nro tho
Mongol Box Company and various
cotton plants, employing about 800
men, nil of whom will bo out of
work for two or three weeks. The
families who havo been driven from
thoir homes are without means nnd
have provisions only to last them for
a short while. Many are sleeping
In tents'and warehouses.
Desperate efforts wero made to
hold tho water from coming over the
levee, but the raging Mississippi roso
so fast that tho efforts of several
hundred workers were powerless.
Ask Governor's Aid.
Frankfort. Ky., Jan. 31. The le
veo at Hickman has broken, and
Mayor Dillon wired Gov. Stanley
this morning asking for aid. Adjt.
Gen. J. Tandy Ellis has sent Capt.
Ben. Wilson, of Earllngton, to the
scene by Instruction of tho Governor
to report on what to do.
Tho Mayor said In his telegram:
"Our leveo gav way early this

FJRE ItAGES IX MIXE
MORE THAN OO YEARS
Lansford, Pa., Jan. 31. The fa
mous mine fire, which has been rag
ing now for moro than sixty years,
and which started at Summit hill
near tho spot where Phillip Glnter
discovered anthracite coal in 1791,
has burned through the Immense
concrete wall which the Lehigh .Coal
and Navigation Company sank In
front of It, deep down Into the earth,
several years ago, at a cost of moro
than a million dollars. It Is now
threatening tho mammoth vein in1
tho Panther Creek valley, tho larg
est and richest vein of anthracite in
the world.
The wall, which was sunk Into tho
ground to a depth of 100 feet, was
fifteen feet thick, of solid concrete,
and experts believed that tho subter
ranean fire would never eat through
it, but that it would prevent It from
spreadlug any further and eventually
extinguish it. Tho fact that tfio
flames havo eaten through this huge
barrier has caused grave fears
among tho Lehigh Coal and Naviga
tion officials who aro now putting
forth every posslblo effort to prevent
tho Are from getting Into tho vast
beds of anthraclto In tho vicinity.
A large force of men aro at work
drilling holes deep into tho earth,
and Into these openings water and
slush Is being poured directly on tho
subterranean Are In tho hope of pre
venting a rapid spread, if possible to
extinguish it.
Already this flro has destroyed
millions of dollars worth of coal,
while tho sixty-year flght to extin
guish it has cost enormous sums.

Washington, Jan. 29. Tli'&Cposl-
tlon of the United State3 in a war-i 3ess lo San Francisco.) One hun
, , , .... ,,'rs ', , ,, , , , t ...
torn world was described to tUf,
House Military Committee by Maj;
Gen. Leonard Wood as like 'that of
"a ship at sea, with typhoon signals
coming from many directions."
"Wo nro living in an era of war,"
ho said, "and gradually aro accumu
lating most of tho troubles of the
world."
Gen. Wood, who appeared at the
committee's hearing on the army in
crease bills, repeated in tho main the
testimony he prcvlouly had given
before the Senate Military Commit
tee. He said it would take an nnny
of a million and a half to hold n Hue
from Boston south. Should condi
tions at the close of the war in Eu
rope Invite attack, ho declared, any
of the moro powerful of the bellig
erents could land ."00,000 men on
American soil in less than thirty
days.
A regular army of 220,000, fully
trained and always under arni3, with
at least 2,000,000 reser.es behind
them, should bo provided, he urged,
to meet this situation. The United
States navy lie classed as fourth in
lighting efficiency, nnd declared it
could not maintain control of the
sea or defend the coasts.
"The continental army is merely
a stop-gap and a makeshift," he
said. "I believe the National Guard
has done all It can do under a rotten
system. Put tho regular army in
tho National Guard's position to-day
and the army would deteriorate."
While Gen. Wood and Col. Edwin
F. Glenn, chief of staff of the De
partment of the East, were testifying
before the Hous0 and Senate Mili
tary committees, respectively, Rear
Admiral R. S. Griffin, chief engineer
of the navy, told tho House Naval
Committee, considering navy In
creases', of the mechanical Ills to
which submarines aro heir and of
the problem of finding suitable en
gines for battleships and destroyers.
Admiral Griffin said he believed
no foreign Power was outstripping
the United States In naval design,
and that typo for type, Amorlcan
craft was as efficient as any afloat.
"To show tho condition of American
submarines ho read a report stating
that each had done from 1,000 to
77,000 miles of surface cruising, and
several hundred miles' submerged
last year. Their engines were avail
able for duty approximately 300
days out of the year, ho a del td,

RELIEF WORK IS UNDER WAY
tf'SanDiego, Cal., Jan. 2!). (By wlr-
dred lives havo been lost, as nearly
'as j ny estimate can show, and
chaj inlng llttlo valleys for fifty miles
north of the Mexican lino lie deso
lato' to-night from floods and cloud
bursts. With tho death toll4 In tho Otay
Valley seemingly established at fif
ty and all relief agencies working
in that direction, reports reached
hero Into to-dny of floods sweeping
the San Luis Rey and San Pasqual
Valleys, doubling the loss of life.
With communication almost alto
gether cut olT It was impossible to
list accurately the number of dead;
conjectures and meager reports
alone were available.
Seventeen bodies were taken out
of San Diego Bay before nightfall
Theso had been swept down the
Otay river when tho lower dam went
out late Thursday, and the current
of the flood was thought to haVC
carried many others out to sea
Tho town of San Diego is virtu
ally undamaged and supplementary
resources aro available to replace its
regular water supply, cut off by the
breaking of the dam.
Many injuries were reported from
Tijuana hot springs, where a hotel
collapsed. A cloudburst, reports
had It, caused the flooding of tho
San Luis Rey and San Pasqual Val
leys. The town of San Pasqual, an
ancient village, cuddled in the moun
tains in a fertile valley, was said to
havo been wiped out altogether.
Railroads, highways, telephone,
telegraph all ordinary means of
communication and relief wero gone
with no prospect of early recovery.
Only tho sea remained, and from it
aid began to come. An expedition
from tho United States warships in
San Diego Bay was started in
launches and barges for the Otay
Valley. Reports were that the first
landing party had been unablo to
penetrate the valley for reasons not
given. The destroyer Lawrence
moved down from her station here
and anchored off tho mouth of tho
Otay river, which stream ran bank
full after being dry for years.
An overland expedition also wa
started from San Diego, with pon
toons nnd englneerling equipment by
which it was hoped swollen streams
might be crossed ami mired roads
made passable. No word came as
to its success.
No ono hero know to-night what
was going on In tho outside world
Of even as near as Los Angeles. The
wireless, tho sole means of commu
nication, except by boat, could not
begin to hnndlo tho business offered
of even tho press dispatches. It was
Impossible to estimate tho amount
of relief work to be dono because no
word from tho stricken valleys con
veyed any Idea of tho number or
plight of th0 survivors.
First reports of tho Otay disaster
reached hero late Thursday. They
told of ranch houses washed away
and of cattle nnd stock drowned.
Investigation appeared to ludicato
exceptionally high wator, and word
came that tho lower Otay dam was
holding. This dam, started as a re
enforced concrete affair, Was chang
ed abovo the foundation lino to a
strip of riveted steel set In concrete,
as a backbono for a loose rock dam.
Engineering magazines throughout
the country commented on It nnd
said that when the roservolr was full
the test of the construction would
come. Tho recent rains filled it for
tho first time. Last night tho flood,
bearing human bodies, with a fright
ful amount of wreckage-; including
hundreds of rattlesnakes from tho
mountainsides,
established, seem-
lngly beyond all doubt, the collapse
of Mie dam. From no other source,
engineers said, could this water have
dbuie.
Tile Tijuana river was at Its- high-
est in its history and reports receiv
ed here from Tijuana say the town
Is under water. Tho racetrack, lo
cated on the border, is believed to
havo been carried away.

The report Indicates that the 7,

war's burden In Eastern Europe.
Nearly 3,000,000 Jews, the report
says, are now facing destitution,
their honies having been pillaged
and destroyed, their industries and
trades ruined and tho entire fabric
of their economic life torn asunder.
Hundreds of thousands. It is said,
wore forced to leave their homes at
a day's notice, among them even tho
