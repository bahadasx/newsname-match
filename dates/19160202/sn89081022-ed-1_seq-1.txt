Breeders Will Get Together.
call has been sent out from the
West Central School of Agriculture
at Morris, asking that West Central
Minnesota live stock men get togeth
er at the annual farmers' short course
at Morris February 14-19 The aim
ot this call is to get the farmers or
nanized to promote the live stock in
dustrv in their territory. The Red
River Valley has a breeders' associa
tion and the feeling has been growing
that West Central Minnesota should
have a similar body to build up an
industrv which means more profit and
grtater piospenty to the farmers.
Another striking feature in connec
tion with the short course will be
the model farmers' club meeting to
be put on by students of the West
entral School This meeting will be
based upon material gathered by re
presentatives of the school who have
attended various meetings of farm
ers' clubs in West Central Minnesota.
The aim will be to bring out criticism
and suggestions that may be of help
to members- of farmers' clubs when
thev go back to their homes.
The whole week's program is pack
ed with good things Lectures and
demonstrations will be given in farm
management, beef production, dairy
ing, commercial seed production,
diainage gas engines, farm buildings,
tarm law, soils, forge work, alfalfa,
the construction of school buildings,
teachers' pension law and preparation
ot rural school lunches
Among the special speakers are
men well known throughout the
Northwest They include Smith,
formerly of the Minnesota College of
Agriculture, W A McKerrow of the
Agricultural Extension Division of the
University of Minnesota J. S. Mont
I Romerv a specialist in horses from
the College of Agriculture, N. E

of the Department of Agriculture of
the University of Minnesota Hugh J.
Hughes and Dan Wallace, editors of
two of Minnesota's leading agricul
tural journals, and many others every
one of whom will be worth hearing.
In addition to the special meetings
of live stock men and farm club mem
bers, there will be evening lectures

School, and inquiries indicate that

O I A
MRS. ALFRED W. CLEVELAND.
Dr. M. Rains received the sad
news Thursday of the death of
youngest daughter, Ethel, wife of Mr.
Alfred W. Cleveland, of Duluth, which
occurred at Long Beach, California,
Wednesday, Jan. 26, caused by some
shock twenty hours after an opera
tion. Mrs. Cleveland was spending
the winter at Long Beach with her
sister, Mrs. H. L. Beckjord of Manila,
P. I. She left Willmar with her chil
dren after a visit with her father,
Nov. 12, apparently in best of health.
Mr. Cleveland was in Grand Rapids,
Mich on his annual buying trip for
his firm, when the sad news of his
sudden bereavement reached him'. He
left Chicago for California over the
Santa Fe Thursday, and burial serv
ices are being held today at Los An
geles. The remains will be taken to
Duluth for interment next spring. Mr.
Cleveland will bring the children to
Willmar, where they will remain with
their grandfather for the present.
Mrs. Ethel Cleveland was born at
Willmar, Jan. 4, 1881, and hence at
tained the age of thirty-five years.
She graduated from the Willmar high
school in 1899. She was a member
of St. Luke's Episcopal church, and
was confirmed by Rev D. C. Booth,
former rector. The deceased was
married in 1903 to Mr. Alfred W.
Cleveland, of the New England Fur
niture & Carpet Company of Minne
apolis. In the fall of 1911 they mov
ed to Duluth, where Mr. Cleveland
became vice president and general
manager of the firm of the French
Bassett Company. The departed
leaves to mourn her untimely death,
her husband two children—Warner
R, age 11 and Georgianna, age 5
her father and sister. A large circle
of friends at Willmar deeply regret
to learn of her demise, and most sin
cerely sympathize with the bereavod
ones, especially with the father re
siding here, who feels the crushing
blow of the death of his devoted
daughter most keenly.
MRS. NILS OLSON.
Mrs. Maria (Jacobson) Olson, wife
ot Nils Olson, a former well-known
pioneer of Green Lake township, died
Jan. 25, at her home in Thief River
Falls. The funeral occurred Satur
day at the Green Lake church in this
county, Rev. I. A. Johanson officiat
ing.
The deceased was born in Romerig,
Norway, Nov. 7, 1838. Her youth was
spent in Christiania. In 1864 she was
married to Nils Olson and in 1872
they came to America, first locating
at Green Bay, Wis. In 1876 they
came to Minnesota, where they locat
ed on a homestead one mile south of
Spicer. Three years ago they moved
to Thief River Falls, where she pass
ed away as above stated. The fol
lowing children, survive with the hus
band to mourn her death: O. N. Ol
son, Mrs. Edward Thorp and Jacob N.
Olson of Thief River Falls, Alfred N.
Olson of Stanley, N. D., Marcus N.
Olson of Spring Brook, Wis, and Mrs.
Ole Jacobson of Spicer. There are
grand children and many other rela
tives.
Mrs. Olson was a member of the
Green Lake church from the time of
its organization, and has a large cir
cle of friends in her old home com
munity in Green Lake township.

NARROW ESCAPE OF
OLD FOLKS HOME
Fire is Discovered Over Boiler Room
at Eight O'clock This Morning.
Much excitement prevailed in the
city this morning when the telephone
reported that the Old Folks building
at the Bethesda Homes at Eagle Lake
was on fire. The terrible condition
of the roads owing to the heavy snow
fall made it impossible to run out
there from the city in time to be of
any assistance. The telephone wire
was kept busy with requests for in
formation. The fire was discovered
about eight o'clock, smoke coming
up through the floor above the boiler
room and up along the walls. Help
was summoned and neighboring farm
ers were on the scene in a few mom
ents.
For a time it looked as though the
building was doomed and the inmates,
some twenty-five in number were tak
en to the orphanage building, and the
furniture was taken out. The seat
of the fire was finally reached and it
was quenched before any serious dam
age was done to the building. Most
damage was done by the water. The
home has a splendid waterworks, a
400-barrel tank on a tower, and each
floor in the building is equipped with
a hose and nozzle This equipment
is what saved the building. The fire
caught between the steel ceiling of
the boiler room and the floor above
the boiler.
The building cost $17,000 A new
addition costing $10,000 had just been
completed, and had the building burn
ed down, the loss would have been a
serious one, not to speak of the em
barrassment in finding quarters for
the old folks There was only $6,000
insurance on the threatened building
Hence it was not surprising that
there was much rejoicing among the
many friends of this charitable insti
tution when it finally became known
that the building was saved.

BAD WRECK AT
WEST END SUNDAY
RUBS
Into Elgin at
and is Derailed Wttk
Two Cars.
A collision which might very easily
have been a serious affair, occurred
last Sunday morning at 9 o'clock,
when east bound passenger train No.
10, crashed into engine 741 in the
west end of the yards.
The accident happened at the west
ern extremity of the "Y", to which
place 741 had gone for the purpose
of pushing ai engine with the snow
dozer, which was stalled there. The
dozer had been ordered out onto the
Sioux City Division, and had gone on
to the to turn around. They were
unable to get thru the snow, tho, and
th other engine was sent out to
shove them thru. 741 backed from the
main line onto the Y, and was near
ly in the clear, when she also got
stalled. At this time No. 10 came in
to sight around the curve beyond the
brick yard, running at a good rate of
speed. The crew on the 741 were un
able to move the engine any, and the
pilot and one of the cylinders pro*
jected out onto the main line. The
engineer on No. 10 threw on the air
but was unable to stop his train. He
and the fireman jumped, thus saving
themselves. The force of the collis
ion tore the pilot off the 741 and de
railed that engine, as well as the
locomotive, the mail and baggage cars
of No. 10. The train came to a stop
when the end of the express car
struck the engine standing on the T.
The express messenger was thrown
from one side of the car to the other,
and the mail clerks were more or
less shaken up and bruised, but no
one was seriously injured. Passen
gers in the sleeper at the rear of the
train scarcely felt the shock.
The engine and cars left the track
on the left hand side, and very for
tunately did not turn over or roll
down the embankment. A special
train was made up here, backed up
to the wreck and passengers, baggage
and express were transferred to this
train and sent on east.
The fast mail train was forced to
go around the other way on Sunday,
and freight service west of here was
tied up for awhile.
By late Sunday afternoon the main
line was cleared away, but it was
not until Tuesday that 741 was nicked
up and the cleared for service
again
