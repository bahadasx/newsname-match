Fifty Hens for Every Southern A Boost For Our Town. n.? rw??J. u.
Farm
In the Corn Belt states it is re
liably stated that the average
farm flock of poultry numbers
nearly 150, while in the Cotton
Belt the average is not more
than 20 or 25 to the farm. In the
Corn Belt the average annual income
per farm worker is double
that of the average in the Cotton
Belt.
There may now be any neces
sar.v connection between these
two facts, but to us it looks very
much like there is, and a very
important connection, at that.
The truth, we believe, is that the
greater earning power of the
Northern and Western farmer is
due to the fact he makes every
edge cut; he cashes in on every
opportunity. He uses labor-saving
machinery; he uses more
horse power and less human labor;
and he uses cattle, hogs and
chickens, all his farm will carry,
to clean up the waste products
and put them in marketable
form.
The Northern and Western
farmer long: ago learned that a
goodly flock of hens is the best
kind of insurance against store j
accounts at credit prices, and he
accordingly makes Biddy pay
the grocery bill, with some to
to spare. Judging from the few
nondescript hens found on a
great many Cotton Belt farms,
we have yet to learn this lesson,
and right now, at the beginning
of 1916, is a splendid time to be
about it.
In the first place, let's under
stand that the Iowa or the Missouri
farmer doesn't keep a big

every day in the year. \
Nor do we believe it be due to ,
a lack of a market in the South (
for chickens and eggs. We don't ,
know of a community anywhere |
in which these products are not ,
salable practically every day in ,
the year. They are almost as ,

results would come from mar \
keting cooperatively and in |
large lots, but chickens and eggs <
in any quantity can practically <
always be sold, and generally at
prices that will afford a profit. t
The carrying of not less than (
fifty laying hens on every farm '
in the South is easily possible j
and would each year add many (
millions of dollars to our wealth, j

eggs a year; but it we make each
farm flock of 50 hens average
100 eggs a year for each hen, we f
have a total of 5,000 eggs, or s
416 dozen, worth, at an average t
of 20 cents a dozen, $83.20,?an r
amount amply sufficient to buy c
all the floor, coffee, sugar, salt, _
etc., needed, with some to spare.
Of course with good management
there is no reason why this

increased.
Why not let's make thi3 one
of our 1916 slogans: "FIFTY
HENS for EVERY SOUTHERN
FARM?" Such a flock,
well cared for, will convert waste
products into marketable meat
and eggs, and will be a big step
t
ior\vara toward a live-at-home
policy and emancipation
from time prices."?Progressive

There is a new spirit abroad 1
in the world. It is the spirit of
democracy, the spirit of getting 1
together, the spirit of co-operation.
This spirit is finding ex- i
pression in small groups, in
clubs and lodges, in unions and
federations and in a growing ^
spirit of unity among the churches.
It is beginning to seek embodiment
in terms of a civic <
consciousness, in better national
unities and in world policies.
Because of the isolation and
individualism of the smaller
towns and cities this spirit is
slow in finding means of exDres
sion. The smaller towns are
social unites of great import- 5
ance, in some respects of more
importance than the larger cities. '
The strongest and most aggres <
sive men of the cities have come
from the country or the smaller j
towns. The greatest men in
the professions, the greatest
leaders in politics and state craft,
in industry and commerce have j
come from the country or smaller
towns. The greatest man
whoever lived came from the ^
little town of Nazareth.
It is possible to make these
smaller towns places of greater 3
:_n? ? j
uiiiueuce ana power.
The old method of improving j
a town was to get some man of
wealth and public spirit to give '
it a fountain, donate a monu- f
ment or put up a library. These
are all important, but it is far j
more important to do things t
that will develop a public spirit,
a spirit of unity and furnish an ^
opportunity and a channel c
through which this spirit may
be expressed for the common
good. _ v
rhe fifcr-t*R>6isarur^-mest
smaller towns is to see them- ?
selves and their needs clearly.
The greatest object of their citi-' 111
zens should not be to get as
many dollars as thpv ran a?#i
to keep them as long as they 1
can, but to build the best town h<
they can and to produce the o
best type of boys and girls, men 01
and women, the best churches fe

With a doctor, old and gray,
Who told me of a dream he had,
I think 'twas New Year's day.
While snoozing in his office,
The vision came to view,
For he saw an angel enter,
Dressed in garments white and
new.
Said the angel, "I'm from heaven
Peter sent me away down
To bring you up to glory,
And put on you a golden crown,
You've been a friend to every one
And worked both night and day
You've doctored many thou

And from few received youi

5o we want you up in glory,
For you have labored hard,
\nd the good Lord is preparing
Your eternal just reward.'*
Then the angel and the doctor
Started up to glory's gate,
3ut when passing close to Hades,
The angel whispered "Wait.
I've a place I want to show you
It's the hottest in all hell,
Where the ones who never paid

In torment must always dwell."

ureat leathering of Laymen
Next Week
Three thousand men are ex,
pected to meet in Columbia,
February 6-9th. It will be a
great Convention of Laymen of
all denominations, met to study
the relation of the church to the
new conditions throughout the
I world. Churches are composed
of laymen; laymen support the
.churches; laymen support the
'j missionary enterprises of the
| church, now laymen will meet
; to survey the field, to learn what
I is being done, and what ought
| to be done. Able speakers will
1 address the laymen and on
themes that are compelling to
their interest and timeliness.
r Such addresses are distinctly
worth while and would repay a
long trip; but along with the information
and the appeal there is
other benefit, a broader outlook,
quickened interest, stimulus to
more active participation in the
work of the local church as the
source of power. That is worth
reflecting on. The laymen are
not undertaking any new thing;
' they are just trying to see. It is
true, probably, that most laymen
1 have been rather half hearted in
( their efforts because they knew
but little of the work of the
> church beyond the Sunday sermon
and the weekly prayer
i meeting. Such a convention as
that in Columbia will bring to
laymen when they are most re!
ceptive a view of the world as a
religious opportunity. But there
will be much more; for the
, church has problems at home
and must study these problems

problems in the congested cities, ,

[must infuse into all relations th#?l o
Vpirit of the gospel. Laymen as "
studying as well as ministers, f
and a free discussion, led by t
men who are in touch with those 1
I things, must prove greatly bene- g
ficial. And the individual, what s
should be his attitude? Such
questions will be illumined by
intelligent discussion. L
Our religious opportunity is a
big one; but it consists not so ^
much in getting more men into v
the membership of our churches E
as it does in developing the j
churches as an efficient tactor
in the life of a workaday world. v
All roads have offered special n
rates, and good rates are offered t]
by Columbia boarding-houses.
The County Chairmen in al- f(
most every county have arrang- a
ed for special coaches to take v
their delegations to the Conven- e
tion, all delegates leaving Monday
morning Feb, 7th. arriving c
in Columbia in time to register p
and be assigned to their hotels a
or boarding-houses before time g
for the evening sessions of the 0

Uncle John Says Friday Is Unlucky
for Many Folks
"Yes, sir," said Uncle lohn n
wher he dropped in our office f(
last Friday morning, telling us ft
he had to hurry back and start a f(
big job of cleaning up and drain- n
ing a wet spot on his farm.?"yes, f,
sir," he repeated, "time was when
I wouldn't a' started nary single &
thing worth mentionin' on Fri- ;<
dav." a
"Fact is," he continued, "in ^
them days Friday was a sure- fj
enough dog gone unlucky day t]
for me, and so was the 13th of c
every month. And I believe
they are everlastingly unlucky j
days yet for lots o' folks. But as ^
for me and my house, as the \
preacher says, we've done got \
shet of that hoodoo."
Whereupon we asked him
how he had removed the spell.
"That's easy enough," the old
man answered. "Used to be f
when Friday or the 13th come V
around, I wouldn't do somethin' 11
I ought to have done that day, ?
or wouldn't start something I ![
ought to have started, and the 1
upshot of it was, it was always 0
an nnlimlrv do? tr\r D -' ^
? ?^ UUJ I?1 IIICl UUl
since I quit all such foolishness 1
as that, them days are about the ?
luckiest days I know, and when .
Friday and the 13th double up
on one and the same day, I like J
to swat the old fake by startin'
more things and doin' more ?
things than almost any other ^
day. I'm tired wastin* my time *
an* sweat on poor hill land and p
lettin' that rich bottom grow up
in weeds and bushes, and I'm ^
goin* to start cleanin' it up today 1
and make a dozen barrels of .
corn, pn acre on it next year."
HuTdbn't you torg5T~
aid Uncle John in leaving,
don't you forget this?that if a of
ellow don't know any better
han to believe Friday is an un- ar
ucky day fer him, it's dead sure rii
