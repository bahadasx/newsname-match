cial pleasure that draws a member
to her club, for with preparatory
reading, earnest and profitable dis
cussion, real good is done by this
organized effort. Study being a main
factor and the members feeling that
through broader information, they
are gaining something, seldom do
club meetings have a small attend
ance. And so although the weather
of last Tuesday was very inclement,
there was a full meeting in the home
of Mrs. P. N. Lott. During the
business period plans wer*i laid for
Reciprocity day February 22. and
for "Social hygiene day" next
month. Mrs. Burney of Columbia,
a former state president, will be the
guest of honor on the 22nd. An in
teresting group of magazine editors
were taken for disoussiou for the
afternoon, these being Sarah J.
Hale, Mary E. Dodge, Anne P.

Jeanette L. Gilder, Kate Field and
Dora Marsden. After these had
been enjoyed the hostess served a
tempting hot lunch that was at
tractively arranged.
Rev. T. H. Posey of Seivern was

The union meeting of this divis

upon Acts 16-9. The meeting was
continued through the afternoon
dinner being served at the church.
The erection of the dwelling of

Valentine Party Planned Pros

ed. Col. Talbert's New
Cottage.
Editor Advertiser: You have
news from all the conntv around,
why not from Parksville? We peo
ple here are planning for "two in
the near future" events. The
first will be a Valentine party
to be held Friday night ll, at
Woodman's hall, the second a cele
bration of Prosperity day, February
29.
The young people have already
spoken of a scissors party at Mrs.
Watson's to prepare decorations for
St. Valentine's party and the young
er and older people are putting on
their thinking caps to devise proper
means of observing Prosperity day.
You know it is a day in which all
the country is interested. Parks-;
ville wishes her celebration of it to
be creditable and note worth v. Mrs.
Watson is a new coiner from North
Carolina, and lives where Mr. Mose
Robertson used to. She has won the
hearts of the young people and is
not so old, that sh? may not be
counted one of them.
Mr. Jack Osborne and family
have also recently moved here from
North Carolina, and occupy the
Holley house. It goes without say
ing they are welcome in our midst.
Col. Talbert has just finished a
pretty little four-room cottage on
the ferry road. It is so neat and
cozy, it's location so well chosen it
looks just the abode for a pair of
lovers and "love in a cottage" Who
knows what Cupid will do with so
many hearts, darts and loving mis
sives that are 'Lying around these
days.
Lots of sickness about. Every
onejtas or has, had a severe cold orj
grippe. Mr; and Mrs. Garland Bos
well's baby boy "Ronnie" who has (
been so ill with pueumonia is able
to be out again. It has been an anz- !
ious time for the parents and we
are glad their baby has been spared/

The MoDuffie literary society was
called to order by ihe president Fri
day, .Jauuary 28, 1916. A large
number of visitors were present and
ihe program was unusually interest
ing. The hist number ou the pro
gram was curreui ?vents, Frances
Jones. This paper covered the most
important ev en LS of the past IWo
weeks ana was altogether a splen
did cue, considering it j was the first
time Frances had appeared before
the society. Emmie Broadwater
read a selection entitled "Six love
letters." Edwin FolK rendered a
very humorous declamation, after
which Ruth Lyon played a beauti
ful selection. The subject for de
bate was resolved: "Thai we should
have woman suffrage in South Caro
lina." Atnrniaiive Jeanie Simkius,
Carroll Kai nsf ord; negative, Gene
vieve iN orris, Pendleton Gaines.
This was quite a live questiou and
after ihe debaters finished, a hot
discussion took place between sever
al of the members. Lydia Bruuson,
Fred Mays and Annie Mae Cul
breath were appointed to act as
judges, and their decision was giv
en in favor ot the .negative. The
following subject for debate at tue
next meeting was adopted, resolved,
"That the state colleges should con
tinue to give scholarships." YV.e

the society. After the report, of the
committees and critic, the society
adjourned to meet February ll.
The trustees of ihe school desire
to sell the two buildings on the
campus which are not used. If they
succeed the .ground which these
buildings occupy, will be converted
into an athletic field. The appear
ance ol the campus will be greatly
beuefitted by having these old
structures removed, and we hope
that a purchaser will soon be
found.
Mr. Lyon ha s appointed a com
mittee ol' teachers to meet him in
the court house next Saturday i or
the purpose of deciding definitely
about Field day. Ail members ut
this committee are urged to be pres
ent so that ail plans can be decided
upon.
School Correspondent.
"UNCLE IV" WRITES.
Commends Stand Taken by J.
Russell Wright. Ali Veter
ans Should be Pension
ed.
Editor The Advertiser: Just a word
please. Your issue of the 19th of
January found me not well still on
the same legs but older and more
feeble than during the Civil war. I
ara satisfied they would not hold to
run a mile race. But I just want to
take off my ha: to J. Russel!
Wright and say amen to every alle
gation he makes in bis charges in
reference lo the way in which some
of the old soldiers, cripples at thai,
were treated while they lived and
the widows of those men were treat
ed. It is a blot on the name of
South Carolina that will grow larger
as time passes on, and who is .to
blame? .
The southern soldiers could not
whip the world and. that was who
they fought. Men from almost all
nations were enlisted in the. north
ern array, while only "southern men
composed the rank and file of the
southern army, with the exception
of some from the western and north
western 8tat?s. I am of the same
opinion as Mr. Wright. AU should
be pentioned, for all. did their best
to win but fortune Was., against
them. Neither R. ?. Lee or Hs ar
ray were whipped but were oat
numbered. ,
I don't claim to know tbe law
governing pensions, but one thing
I do know that in February 1913,
I made application for a pension
(being then 69 years old) and the
county pension board turned me
down because I had a little, just a
little over $500 worth of property
all told on the tax books, and at
that time I owed more than the
amount on .the tax book. I also
made affidavit that neither rriyself
or wife h'kd an " income of $75 per
annum. Well, I am. in the state of
Georgia now and received a notice
a few days ago that my name had
been placed on the pension roll for
this year of 1916.
But let me tell you where it hurt
me. The men composing the pen
sion board of Edgefield county all
knew me. The chairman of the
board having belonged to the same
3ompany that I did but for only a
few months but he came to us a
16 year-old boy aud did his duty
:oo.
The old Soldiers' Home: The
lome and only home for the old
?oldier, that is if he was a true one,
is with his family if he has auy and
if not then with some one be knows.
I, like Wright, prefer to die in a
meep pasture or anywhere near
those I love. I know of one in the
soldiers' home (or was there) who
tiad only his wife and himself to
support and his wife owned a home
but he poor fellow couldn't bear the
idea of sweating in the field to pro
vide for the wife of his youth, and
[ imagine that the Soldiers' Home
ire supporting just such. While
there are quite a number in just as
bad shape but are just too proud to
ask to be admitted into the Soldiers'
Home. I would like to shake
Wright's hand and be one of the
jury to sit in judgment on the case
lie has taken in hand, and am pret
ty sure that after ali the evidence
is taken the jury will say guilty,
with no recommendation of mercy.
[ vote to turn over to the women
af the state this matter and the old
soldier will get what he deserves,
ind won't be long about it either.
Hurrah for Wright!
