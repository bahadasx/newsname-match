APPROPRIATION BIll

Important Measure Sent In
by Chairman Liles
FEES AND LICENSES
REDUCE THE TOTAL
11111 Provides for a 'lax Levy of 61.2
Mills, Which is to Cover All State
Oovernment Expenses. Less than
Last Year.
Columbia, Jan. 29.-The general ap
propriation bill went into the House
today and Chairman Liles has the
distinction of having introduced this
most important measure earlier than
it has ever before been presented. The
committee members, Chief Clerk Mal
colm Miller and Mr. J. C. Townsend,
chief clerk of the engrossing depart
ment, all worked with persistency to
get the bill into the House today so
that. it could be ready for considera
tion on 'Monday.
The essential point of the bill is
that it provides for a tax levy of 6 1-2
mills, which is to cover all of the ex
penses of the State government. Not
withstanding the very heavy demands
th': appropriation )IllI shows a net re
duction in the total of $79,260.80.
It will be interesting to note how
continuously the appropriation bill has
hung around the two million dollar
mark. These figures will be interest
ing:
1914 .. .. .. .. .. .. $2,213,675.51
1915 .. .. .. .. .. .. 2,463,769.82
1916 .. .. .. .. .. .. 2,384,499.02
It is very much easier to under
take to make reductions in an ap
propriation bill than it is to accom
plish this.
Chairman Liles in a talk with the
newspaper men after the introduc
tion of the bill had this comment to
make:
"The committee has faithfully en
deavored to serve the best interests of
the State. We did not appropriate in
accordance with out desires, but we
believe we appropriated as the condi
tion of the State's finances Justified.
The most careful consideration has
been given every item and we feel
sure that the actual needs of every
(partment and every institution have
been supplied, and we think we have
provided funds for extension and imt
provemtelts whore the needs for such
were great. The work of the commit
tee has been absolutely harmonious.
All d lerenees were settled in the
committe room and we are ready to
stand by our work. I cannot speakl
too highly of the faillhfulness of the
members of the comi)tlltee. It has
been a day and night Job since Janu
ary 11. We are hopeful that the re
sults of our efforts will prove satis
factory to the people of the State. It
will he noted that for ordinary State
purposes we have ap propriated ci less
thtan $2,000,000. Th'ie a mounu t for pen
sions and for tile implrovemen t of the
State I lospi tal for' the 11nsane inc reas
es the total as shown. We have car
r'ied out tile resolun o11(f tihe comillt
tee to keep tihe amo11unt raised by levy
withbin $2,0)00,000 and have rcduced the
levy one-hlalf muill."

MANNING PRAISES
NIGIIT SCHOOL WORIK
Governor Sends Special Message to
Legislature Together with Letters
From Laurens County Pupils.
Columbia, Jan. 28.-Governor Man
ning sent a special message to the
general assembly today in which ho
urged that the members give atten
tion to the appeal of the pupils of the
mill night school at Laurens. More
than a score of letters from the pu
pils were embraced in the message.
The pupils have been attending the
night school at the Laurens mill vil
lage.
"I ask that you read these letters,"
said the governor. "Money spent in
providing educational facilities for the
people is an investment which will
bring a rich return in an educated
citizenship. The work that is being
accomplished in these night schools
already has proven its value and I
commend it to your favorable con
sideration."
The pupils of the school made
strong argument in their letters for
continuance of the school.
One of the pupils, a man, said:
We are having a night school at the
Laurens mill schoolhduse. We are
receiving benefit out of it. We have
arithmetic, spelling and. letter writing
and would love to have a night school
during next winter and 1 hope you
will help us to get an appropriation
for a night school during next win
ter."
"W\e have had a night. school for
12 nights," said another pupil, "and
it has been a great benefit to us. We
want to get a teacher for a night
school during next winter. it would
be appreciated and a larger number
would attend."
Excerpts from other letters are:
"I have learned a lot in this time.
It has been a great benefit to me and
other people vwho could not read and
write."
"I have learned a lot since I have
been going to school."
"It has done a lot of good.
"There are about 75 people attend
ing in all and I think if the state
would furnish to money to hire a
teacher they ould take an interest
in coming."
"We can't thank the teachers
enough for cinting over here and
he!i'ing us to learn to read and write.
"\'e have had a anight School here
for 1: nights. Some o: ts vioi are
grown m have Iearned to write our first
l-tiers. \\'e w atnt three 0' four

"I wato ; :t al 1 t make a move for
its peo1p:e here c'uncrnring' a night
school. We are ittC rested in one a11(
asking you repcresntatives to appro
priate money to run four or live
months next winter, so all will appre
elate it, and a teacher who is prepar

The enterprising flirn of Clardy &

he will have considerable time in
which to make his plans for the fu

Wiss Fuller, White Farmer near
1lountiille, Effectnally Stops lid on
His House.
Wright Fuller, a young white farm
er from the Mountville vicinity, was
brought to the county jail 'ht rsday
morning by Deputy Sheriff Owens and
Hural I'oliceman Sullivan, following a
dilliclIty w h!ch had taken place at the
home of WIss Fulle.', another farmer
of that secticn,. the night before.
W%'right Puller, when ho .reached Lau
rens, was considerably bruised and
bunged up from the effects of the
night's happenings. He was placed in
jail in default of bond.
It appears that Wright Fuller and
a friend, Clarence Smith, went to the
home of Wiss Fuller Wednesday night
considerably the worse for drink. Con
rersation waxed warm and Wright Ful
ler used objectionable language in the
presecee of the family. Object ion was
made to it by Mr. Fuller, whereat
Wright Fuller became enraged and aO
conpanied by his friend, left the
house. Ile returned later with a shot
gun to Wiss Fuller's home, making (lire
threats against W\'iss Puller. The lat
ter, hearing the approaeh of the in
truders, made his way around the
house with his own gun and attacked
Wright Fuller unawares. lie felled
him witi the gun1ii, then overpowered
hiim and dragged him into the house
where he tied him to a hed-post. He

to the feasablility of tractor farming
in this section before buying. While
there have been more or less experi
mentation with larger tractors in this
county before, this Is the first small
tractor bought in this vIcinity. They
have been on the market only a few
years. The total cost of the machine
is around $700 and is expected to do
the work of a number of horses.

OPPOSE LABO1 1111,
Blyrnesil Nicholls and litsdale Take
Active Part in Utphi1 Fight .Agninst
Child Labor 11111.
Washington, Jan. 29.-Representa
tine I3yrnes, Nicholls and llagsdale'
took an active part in the light on
the Keating child labor bill when it
was before the house this week, all
making speeches against it. \ir.
Nicholls made his maiden speech, and
made a good impression.
The arguments used against the bill
by the South Carolina members were
that it was unconstitutional to begin
with, and that it was neither needed
or desired by the cotton mill opera
tives of the South, who would be the
people most affected by it. They said
they had received many petitions
from the mill operatives protesting
against the bill.
IRepresentative 1loward, of Atlan
ta was one of the advocates of the
bill. In course of his remarks he
criticised the South Carolina members
for their stand, and intimated that
the labor laws of Georgia were bel
ier than . those of South Carolina.
"The strong arm of the law protects
the children in Georgia,'" he said.
I am glad to hear that the strong
arm of tile law prtotects somebody in
Georgia," retorted .\l. 1lyrnes, and
this brouglht down the house.
Then \lr. Rtagsdale got in a word
and invited Mr. 1ioward's attentioln
to the fact that no governor of South
Carolina w\as ever t reatened by a idob,,
and the house :eled to enjoy his
thrust, too.
Mr. Hloward did not attempt any re
ply.
Messrs Byrnes and lagsdale offered
a number of amendments, intended to
cripple the bill, but all of them were
rejected, as the sentiment of the house
is overwhelmingly for the bill as it
stands. The bill will come up again
next Wednesday, and may be passed
on that day. Its ultimate passage by
the house by a large majority is con
ceded, but there is no such certainty
as to what the action of the senate will
be.
The bill seeks to prohibit the em
ployment of children under 1.1 years
in mines or manufacturing establish
ments, and to prohibit. the employment
of children under I( years for moret
than S hours a day, or at night.

The question of whether Solicitor

mid no one will be able to decide that
