Local Consumers Say Product
is Unclean; Mothers Charge
It Makes Babies Sick
As the result of complaints which
daily are being received from consum
ers bota, in Honolulu and at Aiea and
Walpahu. A; W. Hansen, federal pure
f11
the -other business of his office to ln-i
vestlgate what - is reported to .be an
unusually poor milk supply, the main
contention of those who have com
plained being that the local product is
unclean.
Mr. Hansen has found that the pres
ent bad weather is largely the cause
of the poor supply; and also that, in
some instances, dairies have failed to
see that their cows and the hands of
their milkers are clean. One of the
most general complaints Is that the
milk does not keep any length of time,
but sours shortly after being deliv-.
ered.
Mothers have complained to Com
missioner Hansen that their babies
have become sick as a result of feed
ings of the milk. These reported
cases of illness, however, may or may
not have been directly due to the
milk, says Mr. Hansen.
Better Weather May Help.
By personal investigations and ex
aminations, the office is endeavoring
to get at the seat of the trouble. Bet
ter; weather may lessen the com
plaints, it was reported today.
In the report which he is preparing
for. presentation to the board of
health, Mr. Hansen comments on the
milk situation as follows: "
"During the month we have had a
great many complaints in regard to
milk. Some of thes were that the
milk was dirty. The most common
and frequently comdaint, however,
has been that the milk could not be
kept, but soured quickly.
"We have found that there has been
good cause for" many of these com
plaints. The unusually wet weather
that has prevailed lately has made it
extremely difficult to produce clean
milk. At such a time in particular is
the dairyman a menace to public
health who is not careful about having
the udders of the cows and the
hands of the milkers carefully cleaned.
"To my mind the prlncinal cause of
our present serious difficulty with the
milk supply is careless milking."
The office is now working with a
view to having the dairymen first of
all give more attention to the cleanli
ness of both cows and milkers.

Five new beet sugar factories will

and 7",0i)ii more afcres will in conse
quence be growing sugar beets, as a
result of the prospect of Congress re
taining the present protective duty.
This is the statement of Samuel
Nicholson, a director of the Holly
Sugar Company, who is a guest at
the Moana, making a personal study
of sugar production in' the islands,
He is a Denvtr, Colorado, man, and
has an extensive knowledge of beet
sugar conditions. :
"I am interested in the first sugar
factory ever erected at Sheridan, Wyo

kikl hostelry. "It has just been built
and has the d.stiuction of being the
first beet sugar factory put up since
the election of President Wilson. It
was the only factory for making beet
sugar built in 1915 in the United
States.
"This year, with the prospect of the
cne-cent duty being retained, there
will be at least five new beet-sugar
factories built in the United States,
of which three will be in Wyoming
and two in Nebraska.

Doubts Larsen's Report, and
Opines Figures "Stretched"
a trifle
Mayor 1.3 ne, together with his sec
retary, is investigating the figures
submitted by Supervisor Larsen to
the other supervisors at their last
meeting, regarding the alleged high
cost of operating the municipal quarry
at MoiliilL The Investigation is being
made to satisfy the; mayor himself,
and not for the supervisors.
"The report was read before the su
pervisors in regular meeting," he says,
"and is therefore a matter for them
to consider If they care to do so. My
own study of the report and conditions
at the quarry is to satisfy myself. '
"I cannot say until we have finish
ed the investigation," continues the
mayor, "just whether Larsen's figures
will prove correct or not, but I don't
lay much' stress on them at the,pre
sent time.
"I have considerable doubt as to the
report, especially as to whether the
saving of $350 each month which Lar
son claims could be made by buying
from private concerns.
Keeps Rock Prices down.
"One thing that is certain is that
the quarry holds down the price of
rock. Without the quarry to back us
rock prices would be sure to go up,
and we would not be able to buy as
cheaply as Larsen quotes in his re
port." Acting Road Overseer Sam Kelilnoi
has been called into consultation with
the mayor, and according to the latter
believes that study of the report will
show that the figures have been
"stretched to meet the ideas of one
man." f?
"It is impossible," continues Mayor
Lane, "to figure the finances of a city
on the same principle as a private con
cern. Private concerns have their
profit and loss columns to consider
when selling their goods. We ? get a
certain appropriation in a certain de
partment and economize in every way
to keep within it
"Also, we pay prices for citizen la
bor that exceed what private concerns
have to pay for non-citizen labor. I
feel that all in all the city is doing its
duty by Us citizens."

NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 2. The British steamer Appam, brought '

capture by a German war-vessel off the Canary Islands last month,
is now anchored off Fortress Monroe. No passengers have been
permitted to land by the American authorities. In fact, the only
one aboard the liner who has been allowed ashore is the leader of
the prize crew, Lieut. Berg. No communication between -those '
aboard the steamer and the land will be permitted pending a decision
as to the disposition of the vessel.
Unconfirmed reports which got ashore are that the prize crew,
greatly outnumbered by the British crew and others on the voyage
across the Atlantic, rigged up an explosive device and held it as a
threat to ensure good behavior of all aboard during the voyage. -

By the treaty of 1828 with Germany, it is provided that prizes

of the previous treaty between the United States and Great .Britain.
The British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, has formally ask
