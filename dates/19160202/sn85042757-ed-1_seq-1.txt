CLIFTY TO THE FRONT
Farming Spirit Strong and Outlook for
This Year Very Bright.
Charile O'Neal, of DeRosaett, ia
upending Sunday and Mnnaay with
homefolks.
Koy O'Neal spent Sunday at Pleas
ant Hill visiting among his old school
friends.
Or. J. R. Gott is up after rather a
severe attack of lagrippe
Mrs. Harris Hatcher, of Sparta, was
in Clifty last week in the interest of
the Sparta bakery, which she recently
purchased.
Miss Myrtle Ashburn has a good
school at Eastland, and will be enabled
to spend her time with homefolks while
attending to her duties. Eastland ia a
village about a mile weat of Clifty.
Zollie W. Kackley has returned from
Nashville where he has been attending
the Grand Lodge of Tennessee. He

film play, "The Hii'i!? of a Nation"
and to visit homefolks. He will re
turn via Crossville and other points.
Dr. C- Q. Johnson, of Monterey, has
been in Cliffy several days and the
tfcwla ot those who are so unfortunate
as to be afflicted with teeth, make the
weklin ring. He returned Sunday via
Pleasant Hill.
Mrs. W B. Young had the misfor
tune to fall and fracture her shoulder
bone last week, but is reported to be
greatly improved at present. Mrs.
Young is greatly missed in the Sunday
school and we all wish her a speedy re
covery. We are in the wake of the great
grippe epidemic and have resumed the
work of school, which is crowded to its
utmost capacity on account of the fact
that so many new families have moved
in, due no doubt to the increase in
business, for the mines are running
full time, several of the entry men
running double shifts -day and night.
Mrs. J. R Gott entertained the ilttle
folks Friday afternoon in honor of her
son. Master John Richard, Jr. Quite a
lot of the little folks were present and
enjoyed a good time playing games.
Roy E. Bell, of Crossville, was here
last week on business, and while here
was the guest of R. U. Holt at the
Caney Fork Hotel.

with her mother.
Or. W. B. Young is in Kentucky on
business, and will return Monday or
Tuesday of this week.
Mr. McCoriuick has installed a soda
water fount in the Company store, the
presence of which makes us feel as if
we were getting in line with the big
cities.

visiting his lather, a. r. wa'Ker.
Sanford is an old Clitt'y boy and we are
glad to know that he is making good in
his new position with the N. C. & St.
L. railway.
The company has a gang of men at
work pulling stumps with the new
stump-puller loaned our people by the
railroad company. We have our hearts
set on being a farming community
second to none in the state, and every
man and boy in Clif ty has the farm
anirit. We will clear una lot ot ad-
rtitionai lanu iius apiniB "
and imDroved farm machinery, which ;
is being furnished through the co-oper-'
ation ot the men and the company, and
bv applying expert advice from the
agricultural departments ot state and
fecleial agents, we believe that we will
be able to see our town on the agricui-
tural map. i
.. .. .. .. . .
Mr Converse, or tne ueparmicui in
Agriculture of the University of Ten-
nessee. was a visitor in our luwu uuc
day last week, while nere ne was
shown over the plot selected for the
railway demonstration farm and pro
nounced it ideal. He was also shown
several of the herd of hne Hereford
cattle recently purchased by Dr. Young
and Professor Brandon, and spoke very
highly of the step we are taking to
wards the betterment of the cattle we
are raising. He was very enthusiastic
over the question of feeding silage, I
and gave us outlines for a very cheaply
constructed silo. There is no doubt 1
but what the spring will see the erec-1
tion of some half dozen silos, among j
them being the community silo to be J
erected by those parties who do not
have enough stock to justify the
building of a silo but by combining can i
Duno a central pint a very little mdi
. vidual cost and with good results for
all.
Another question that our people are
interested in is that of sheep raising.
We believe it to be the moat profitable
business the small farmer can engage
in. For example, Jeesse Lowe, a resi
dent of Cumberland county, and a
neighbor of ours, brought a sheep to
Clifty which he sold out as mutton,
realizing from the sale something like
$9.00. He told Or. Young that the
sheep had cost him not over 15 c, that
being for a little corn he had fed while
the snow was on the ground. Of
course it stands to reason that one
could not make that much on every
sheep raisied, but it is true that more
can be made, for the amount invested,
than in any other kind of live stock.
There is a move on foot among our
people to organize a sheep growing
association,
Before closing, your correspondentt
wishes to thank the good people of
Cumberland for the gift, through the
County Court, of the $4,000.00 for
building the road from cutty to Cross
ville. We Clifty people appreciate
this favor, especially aa it pill bring
our good towns some hours closer to
gether, and we can visit more and
know each other better. Our own
county court has awakened to the fact
that the mountain was due some con
sideration and at a recent meeting ap
propriated some four or five thousand
dollars for i ad purposes in the moun
tain district. This money added to the
work our peo: le are read and willing
to do, will gi ; roads that we all can
feel oroud o, nd will be a benediction
to all people: .or generations to come, I

Injunction Proceedings in Fentress Coun
ty of no Effect in This County.
Some contrcjvetsy arose in Fentress
county over the location of a portion
ot the Dixie Short
Jamestown and an
Houte north of I
injunction was '
brought to restrain the majority of the
commissioners from building the roau
via Forbus, which the enjoiners claim
is not for the best interest ot the
county.
It was reported here that the injunc
tion was sought to restrain the com
missioners from running the road via
Wartburg and Oakdale, thus leav
ing Cumberland county out, as the nn
rierdftod connection at the Cumberland
and Fentress county line could not be
made and our road when built to the
Fentress county line would have no
connection that would enable travelers
with autos to go on to Louisville and
Cincinnati.
Money was raised in Crossville in a
tew minutes to send a man to Wart
burg, where the injunction case was to
bfl heard Saturday, but it was learned
that our people had been misinformed
and that no change to divert the road
via Wartburg was contemplated. On
that assurance no one was sen. It had
heui arranged thatJudge !. W. Dorton

IN INTEREST OF PREPAREDNESS,
President Wilson is making a tour of
the middle west in the interest of his
military preparedness plans. His first
speech was at Pittsburg, Pa. He will
go as far west as Topeka ano will not
return to Washington until February 4.
HOW CAN WE RAISE
THE NEEDED TAXES?
Some Difficulties in Sight That Seem tO
Leave Tax Equalization as the On
ly Right and Fair Solution of
the Vexing Question.
The Highway Commissioners have
sold the $200,000 road bonds and thev
will be delivered within the next few
days. This will necessitate the rais
ing of $10,000 annually to pay the in
terest on the bonds. The question now
is the raising of this sum.
Since 1 nave been connected with the
County Court the county has been run
on as ecnomical a basis as possible.
The tax levy has been made as low as
could be to get sufficient revenue to
irun the various departments oi tne
county. But some people seem to
think that additional expenses can be
met with the ame valuation and the
same tax rate.
OBLIGATIONS INCREASE.
The obligations ot the county have
Deen increasing at a rapid rate for the
paat ten years. Court house bonds to
the amount ot $25,000 have been is
sued. A high scho"l has been estab
lished which must be maintained. The
public schools are now given a five, in
stead of a three months' term. Road
bonds to the amount ot $40,000 have
heretofore been issued, and now
$200,000 more road bonds have been is
sued. ONLY 1WO REMEDIES.
These things all seem necessary but
they can not be paid for at the same
old rate of taxation and the same as
sessment. Then what ia to be done'
fn my opinion there are only two
things that can be done : Either raise
the rate on the present valuation or
raise the assessment and leave the rate
at something like what it is now.
RAISE VALUES. REDUCE RATE.
The question is often asked, Whv
is the valuation not raised and the rate
lowered?" This would seem to oe the
best thing to do for the cuunty at first
thought, but there are certain difficul
ties in the way which 1 believe is not
understood by the majority of (he tax
pavers. I We now pay the state 35c on the
j $100 valuation which in round numbers
'amounts to about $5000. We receive in
j taxes from the railroads and telephone
i and telegraphs about $10,000.
I The valuation on these corporations
lis fixed by the state Railroad Comuus
j sion. If we double our assessment we
I will pay the state $10,000 instead of
$5,000.
If uia Inujor niir vatf tn iinp-hnlf Wfl
will lose in taxes from the railroads i
(.i.nh, .H talanhnne. sr,nnn .;
so we will have lost to the state and to
these corporations $10,000 apd will
have no more taxes than vie would
have had to leave the assessment ana
rate at what it has been in the past,
and yet we have not got the $10,000
additional taxes which we must have to
..
nieet tne new issue oi
bonds.
BE RAISED?
HOW btiALii r ujnlis
How shall we raise this sum? This
is the question which must ne met. I
offer the suggestion that it can be
raised by equalizing our assessment.
Some of our property is assssed at
about what is is worth and some of it
is assessed at nve times ies& mirh wn
it nrth
, hD hH M.tnntn an over thA
naRPsqment with the snecial
entire assessment witn tne special
committee appointed by the county
court within th" past few days,
inunu , ami) AJEHhMWN'l
AVERAGE LAND ASSEsHMENI.
The general average of our acreage
DroDerty is ridiculously low so low
hegltate t0 have it published
tnat 1 nesildie iu nave ii puunouuj.
The average assessed valuation of
acreage property for the entire county
is $2,64 ; this, too, includes all our
farms with their houses, barns, aid
other improvements.
As a matter of fact we have tut
vtvy few hundred acres that are rot
worth this amount and we have many
' thousands of acres that are worth frioi
$10 to $50 per acre and could not be
bought for that amount.
I know ot farms with more than five
hundred acres with good houses, barns
and other good improvements that are
assessed at $2.00 per acre. Again 1
know of lot property with only enougn
land on which to build a house and
nave a little garden that can not be
rt'uu'u xor more man $e to iu per
month, and it is assessed higher than
the man with the five hundred acre
tract.
ASSESSMENT NOT EQUAL.
This is not right. It, is not just.
It is not equal. The man with the
! fariu enould be made to Pay h is Pr
, portion of the taxes.
Many of our little farms over the
county are already assessed high
enough. The burden should tall on the
man who owns the property. He
should not complain if his property is
assessed at sometning near what it is
worth.
bo, if we had a readjustment of our
assessment and all property equalized,
we would have money enough to pay
the additional sum called for at this
time.
We have spent $40,000 in road build
ing. Ir we spend $200,000 more our
property will certainly be worth more.
If it will not we had as well not spend
it.
PERSONAL PROPERTY.
Our assessed value of personal pro
perty is only given in at about $70,000.
Any one who knows the citizenship of
the county knows that this does not
approximate the real valuation ot our
taxable personal property. Many who
own personal property subject to tax
ation fail 'o give it in to the assessor.
They do not seem to know that they
are violating the iaw and cheating
their own county.
A man should be as careful and
conscientious in answering the ques
tions by the assessor touching his pro
perty under oath as he would be it in
court testifying, and when they do
tnis we will have more than $70,000
personal property turned in to be
taxed.
NO REFLECTIONS ON ANY ONE.
What 1 have said in this article is
not to oe construed as finding fault
with, or laying the blame on, the past
or present assessors. Our property
has been asssossed in about the same
way for years and years. The fault
is largely with the taxpayer himself.
He puts one price on his property to
tne assessor and another when he goes
to sell and they are widely different.
BE HONEST WITH ASSESSOR.
When the assessor comes around
this year let us all be honeat with him
and ourselves, and turn in our property
subject to taxation at about what it is
reasonably worth, and then leave it to
ihim and the Board of Equalization and
the county court to make our taxes as
rtble as th' can and get revenue
sufficient to run our county and keep
up its good credit.
Very respectfully,
Geo. V. Burnett, County Judge.

Mr. Brandeis is now 60 years old and
under the usual custom he would not

There was much talk of W. H. Taft

to have held that honorable position.
