"KNOWS HIS STANDARD"
In Address Before Immense
Throng in Des Moines,
Executive Faces Issue.
FEARS NO DANGER FROM WITHIN
Advocates Government Ownership of
Munition Plants, But Would
Change in Crisis.
Dee Moines. Ia.. Feb. 1.?Preaident Wil
son tonight picked up the gauntlet burled
dom-n by former President Rooeevelt. Just
as Col. Roosevelt has attackeu nino, so
plainly that no one could mistake who
was meant. President Wilson scorchlngly
criticised the former President. He did
not mention hi? name, but there were
femr preaent who did not know who was
the object of his remarks.
"There are some men actually preach
ing* war." he declared, in discussing the
dangers to this country. "They seek con
troversies with other nations. They would
hare America abandon its traditional pol
icies and engage in the conflict now dev
astating Kurope.
Far*? Great Crowd.
"1 know not what the standards of
tnose men are. but I do know I cannot
set to thoae standarda."
The Presidents address tonight was de
livered before the greatest crowd he
has yet faced on his preparedness swing
mound the circle. He referred to th-?
lireat crowd in his speech as evidence of
I tee ?rreat Interest in national defense.
The message continually reaches me.
?We are counting upon you to keep this
<?-untr> out of war," " the President said.
"I have expended all my energy to
do so." __,
The President strongty reliera terf hla
?velaration that "hyphenated American
ism " is a thing of the past.
"Dangers to our peace do not come
? ii> longer from within our own borders,"
he sditi I could not say that six months
mzci Passton was astir then in thla coun
try. But the danger is past. America
ht?s regained her self-possession. No in
fluence within America is going to diaturb
Ihe peate of America.
..mertca's dangers?and they are many
?-come from contact with other nations. '
President Wilson strongly advocated
fcoverninen? ownership of munitions
plants.
"But," he said, and he paused to em?
rhaeize Us statement, "if it come? to
ihe question ot defending this nation we
are going to defend It. no matter who
makes money."

People Bewildered by Wilson's Words
That Nation Must Be Ready for
War Tomorrow.
By AUGUSTUS F. BEACH.
Berlin, Feb. 1.?After being apparently
settled to the satisfaction of both gov
ernments, the sinking of the Lusitania
once more looms on the horlion of In
ternational tranquillity to disturb to the
straining point the relations between the
United States and Germany.
Until yesterday the feeling prevailed In
Germany that the matter of the lusi
tani? aa an element of friction had be
come a thing of the past. The Ger
mans, however sure they may have been
of the Justice of the deed at measured
by rights and principles, have never been
proud of sinking the Cunarder with the
attendant loss of neutral lives.
It may be aald with absolute and un
questioned authority that Germany was
thankful when announcement was made
that the controveray with America had
been adjudicated by the German gov
ernment agreeing to make full repara
tion for the neutral loss entailed, that la
as full reparation as was possible, where
the loas of human lives was Involved
Suddmly, today, a new situation of im
mense gravity exist?.
Yesterday came news of a hitch in th?
negotiations, and to rompllcate matters, ,
pr-ess reports of an address by Presi- j
dent Wilson in which he declared, or was i
reported to have declared, that the United ?
States must be prepared for war tomor
row?not the day after tomorrow, but to
morrow*.
According to reports that reached Ger
many, the President made it clear that
ha was not using a figure of speech, but 1
was speaking of war as a possible pend
ing actuality.

Neither would he explain why he had

CRISIS FORCED ON U. S.
BY BRINGING OF APPAM
TO AN AMERICAN PORT
Whether Vessel Is Released or Interned,
Warm Diplomatic Dispute Is Likely
To Be the Aftermath.
GERMANS MAY SEEK TO STAY
Decision Likely to Have Strong Effect Upon Present Negotia
tions and Hardly Can Help Being Embarrassing to
This Government?President Is Pleased.
Whether the L'nited States government decides to intern the Brit
ish steamer Appiani, which arrived in Hampton Roads yesterdav in
charge of a German prize crew, or decides to release her and turn her
over to the British owners, officials of the State Department are antici
pating trouble.
Whichever way the decision goes, it i ? realized that a warm diplo
matic dispute is in prospect either with Great Britain or Germany.
The indications at present are that the vessel will be interned,
although officials are careful to say that such predictions are subject to
modification in the light of material information yet to be received.
If the United States decides to intern her, it is stat?td. it will be
either on the ground that the Appam, since capture, has been converted
into a German naval auxiliary, or that the treaty of 1779. between
Prussia and the United States, obligates this government to grant an
asylum to Greman prizes.
