Hampton Roads today, flying the Ger

of the German naval reserve and 22
men in charge.
The Appam now lies off Old Point
Comfort, under the guns of Fortress
Monroe, waiting for the state depart
ment at "Washington to determine her
status whether she is a man of war,
subject to internment, or a German
prize. By tomorrow, the customs au
thorities here hope to have orders to
send the ship either to Norfolk or
Newport News, where the anxiously
waiting British civilians will be put
ashore.
According to the story told with
great reserve by Lieutenant Berge to
Collector Hamilton when he formally
reported his presence in American ter
rltorial waters late today, the Moewe
captured the Appam bound from Da
kar, French "West Africa, for Liverpool,
after a brief show of resistance, on
Jan. 16, 60 miles north of the Madeira
Islands. On board the Moewe then
were the crews of five vessels, previ
ously captured, all of whom were
transferred to the Appam.
From all reports, the raider is a con
verted German merchantman with a
false canvas forecastle concealing a
battery of guns of fairly large calibre.
On Jan. 17 she engaged in battle with
an armed Australian trader, the Clan
MTavish, which she sank after an,

Later, under orders . from the com
mander of the raider, Lieutenant Berge
headed his prize for an American port
and parted company with the Moewe.
Nothing has been seen or heard of the
raider since, and the Appam steamed
across the ocean on an uneventful voy
age, reaching the Virginia capes at
6.45 this morning.
On board the Appa mall told are 452
persons the prize crew of 23; 20 Ger
man civilians who were oh their way to
England for internment; 138 seamen
captured with the British ships; 116
passengers on the Appam and the Ap
pam's crew of 155.
Lieutenant Berge claims the Appam
is a prize of war,- but the government
officials have not yet accepted this

DIPLOMATIC PHASES OF
CAPTURED STEAMER APPAM
Whether It Is a Prize of War or a
Converted Auxiliary Cruiser.
Washington, Feb. 1. Untilit is de
cided whether the German command
er aboard the British steamer Appam
brought the ship to an American port
as a prize of war or as a converted
auxiliary cruiser of the German navy
there will be no determination on the
government's course respecting the
ship.
When certain formalities have been
complied with, the ship's passengers,
including several British colonial of
ficials, will be released and their dis
position passed on by immigration au
thorities. Any prisoners of war will
be released, because international law
permits no holding of war prisoners
in a neutral country.
- The United States then, finally will
have to deal with the tierman crew
under Lieutenant Berge and if they
are accounted in the naval service of
Germany as were the crews of the
Prinz Eitel Friedrich and the Kron
prinz Wilhelm, already interned at the
Norfolk navy yard, they, too, will be
Interned unless their ship goes to
sea to run the cordon of British cruis
ers outside.
As to the disposition of the Appam
herself, if she is held to be an aux
iliary cruiser, her commander will
have the option of putting to sea after
a certain time to make repairs and
take provisions. . If she is declared a
prize the situation becomes more com
plex and in that event it is admitted
that the United States will have to
deal with probably the most novel
question concerning its neutrality that
has arisen during the war.
As one of the first steps, the prob
lem probably would be referred to the
neutrality board which is an unoffi
cial body composed of James Brown
Scott, former solicitor of the state de
partment; Captain Harry S. Knapp,
of the navy general board and Captain
J. H. Oliver, head of the naval Intel
ligence office. The board's findings
while merely advisory, have weight
with the state department.
It was pointed out at the state de
partment that there is much confusion
in the treaties and provisions of in
ternational law on the subject of
prizes; the right to convert captured
vessels into auxiliary warships and the
right of reclamation by the original
owners of captured vessels.
SUBMARINE
K-5 ON
WAY TO KEY WEST.
No Casualties and No Assistance Re

Washington, Feb. 1. The submarine
K-5 is safe and proceeding under her
own power for Key West, Fla., accord
ing to: naval' radlS' message received

The message came by way of Key
West, and said:
'At 3.55 a. m., U. S. S. K-5 five
miles southeast Fowey Rock, steaming
south at ten knots. No casualties and
no assistance required."
Fowey Rock referred to in the mes
sage is a lighthouse and is located
about ten miles from Miami. Navy
department officials estimated that un
der the speed the K-5 is making she
should reach Key West about 6 p. m.
today. The Sterrett was one of the
destroyers ordered by Secretary Dan
iels to search for the K-5.

HAS GERMANY DEVELOPED
TRANS-ATLANTIC SUBMARINE?
Navy Officials Generally Are Skeptical
of Reports.
Washington, Feb. 1. The possibility
that a German submarine accompanied
the captured British liner Appam
across the Atlantic and was preparing
to operate oil the American coast
aroused much interest among navy
officials here. No information tend
ing to confirm the reports to that ef
fect had reached the department, but
officials pointed out that so far as
cruising radius of modern submarines
is concerned, the operation would be
entirely possible.
If, as navy officials have some rea
son to believe, Germany has recently
developed submersibles of a thousand
tons' displacement or more, a trans
Atlantic voyage could be made with
out great hardship. The United
States has one 1,000 ton boat, the
Schley, almost completed and soon will
order two others even larger which will
keep the sea with the fleet in all
weather.
Navy officers generally were skep
tical of the reports, however, although
It was recalled that the flow of American-made
munitions to the allied pow
ers probably would begin to reach its
full proportions within the next few
months, inviting unusual efforts by
the Teutonic naval forces.
The main reliance of a submarine is
her torpedoes end no submersible can
carry more than half a dozen. To re
supply them in the United States
would be practically impossible with
out the effort being detected, officers
said, leaving the submarine with only
her small disappearing gun for arma
ment. HAD VERBAL TILT

Providence, R. I., Feb. 1. The end of
the trial of Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mohr
and two negroes, C. Victor Brown and
Henry H. Spellman, charged with the
murder of the woman's husband. Dr.
C. Franklin Mohr, seemed to be in
sight when the court took an early
adjournment today.
Brown and Spellman to Testify.
At the request of William H. Lewis,
counsel for the negro defendants, to
day's session ended two hours earlier
than usual in order to give Mr. Lewis
time to get a few witnesses whose tes
timony he wished to introduce before
calling Brown and Spellman to the
stand. Mr. Lewis stated that he ex
pected to finish by tomorrow night.
Both sides expressed the belief that
the case would be ready to be given
to the jury by Saturday.
Only Two Witnesses Called.
Only two witnesses were called up
to the time of adjournment. They
were E. H. Emery, local weather fore
caster, who stated that the weather
was clear on the night that Dr. Mohr
and his secretary. Miss Emily Burger,
were shot down in their stalled, auto
mobile, and William Williams, a negro,
an inmate of the state prison.
Alleged Statement by Healis.
Williams declared that George W.
Healis, the doctor's chauffeur, who has
turned state's evidence, said to him
that the attorney general advised him
to "stick by the state" and he would
get off lightly while the other boys,
Brown and Spellman, would get life
imprisonment. He asserted also that
Healis quoted a representative of the
attorney general's department sa say
ing "they are after the woman and not
the boys." i
Under cross examination, Williams
stated that he is now serving a term
for manslaughter and that Attorney
Edwards, counsel for Henry Spellman,
acted as his attorney at the trial.
200 MIDSHIPMEN TO
- BE. ASKED TO RESIGN
Because of. Their, Failure to Pass the
- . ,HH Yssrly-. Examinations. . -
Annapolis, Md., Feb. 1. -It was un
derstood on reliable authority hers to
day that 20 midshipmen, or about
one-iourtn oi ine entire memoersnip
at tne naval academy win be asxed i
to resign soon because of their fail
ure to pass the half-yearly examina
tions. Many midshipmen claim that
the examinations were much harder
than usual, but this is denied by the
instructors.
The number of failures Sn each class
is said to be as follows:
First, or graduating class, 20; sec
ond, 60; third, 60; fourth 80. The fact
that the academic board considers
each case gives hope to some cf the
young men that they will be afforded
a further opportunity of remaining in
the naval service.
One explanation of the large num
ber of failures is that instructors have
been forbidden to indicate in any way
to the midshipmen the character of
the examination. The court of inquiry
which investigated the scholastic
methods of the academy recommended
abolishment of the "dope" system, as
it was called and an order forbidding
the use of any kind of special help
followed. Many midshipmen claim
that the averaga 3'outh needs these to
pass the exaitiir.stion. Others claim
that the midshipmen felt that, on ac
count of the special need of officers,
they would be treated more leniently
than usual.
GUNMAN ARRESTED BY
SCHENECTADY POLICE.
One of Gana of Five Who Shot Four
Persons Last Friday.
Albanv. N. Y.. Feb. 1. Harold Sev-
ery, 25 years old, who says his home
is in Boston, arrested in Schenectady
today as the gunman who last Friday
shot four persons here,- tonight was
positively identified by John McCor
mick, one of the victims, as the man
who attacked him. Severy, the police
said, would be arraigned in police
court tomorrow, charged with assault
in the first degree.
As the grand Jury is not in session,
the police plan to have Severy held
without bail while they attempt to
connect him with the shooting of three
other persons, one of whom died from
his wound.
Severy was arrested by the Schenec
tady police this afternoon after the
landlady of a boarding house where he
had a room reported that his actions
had aroused her suspicions that he was
the much-sought gunman. In Severy"s
trunk was found a .22 calibre target
rifle, equipped with a silencing device.
The rifle was also equipped with a
heavy wire with which it could be
fired. Severy explained to the police
that he carried the gun in his coat
sleeve and by pressing upon the wire
discharged the rifle. He also could
reload the weapon from his armpit
without removing it from his sleeve.
He told the police that he had prac
ticed with the rifle on the streets of
Albany Friday.

Of PROTEST NOT SUFFICIENT
Preparedness Essential for
United States, Says
FLAG CANNOT BE STAINED WITH IMPUNITY
Asserts That the Difficulty of Keeping America at Peace Dur
ing the Great European War Cannot be Disclosed Now
- Leciarea lhere Are Actually Men in the United States
Who Are Preaching War Others Go so Far as to Ad
vocate Peace at Any Price Said These Men Did Not
Know the Circustances of the World Address at Des
Moines Punctuated With Tremendous Applause.
Des Moines, Iowa. Feb. 1. President
Wilson, In addressing the largest au
dience of his present trip, In which he
is advocating preparedness, here to
night asked this question:
"Do you want the situation to be
such that a!l the president can do is
to write messages and utter, words of
protest ?'
"Why to ask that question is to
answer It," he said. .
"Whenever international law is vi
olated by one or the other belliger
ents," the president said, "America was
called upon register a 'voice of pro
test, of insistence.'
"Do you want the situation to be
such that all the president can do
is to write messages and utter words
of protest? If these breaches of In
ternational law, which are in daily
danger of occurring, should touch the
very honor of the United States, would
you wish to nothing about It?
Do you wish to have all the world say
that the flag of the United States can
be stained with Impunity? Why, to ask
the question is to answer it.
"I know there' is not a man or wo
man within the hearing of my voice
who would wish peace at the expense
of the honor of the United States."
Spoke Slowly and Gravely.
The president's address was Dunctu-
ated with thunderous applause. He
spoke slowly and gravely, with em
phatic gestures to enforce his words.
His declaration that the United States
wanted peace drew a auick response
and the assertion that the self-respect
of the nation must be preserved elicit
ed another gieat demonstration. A
throng that flUed every seat in the
Coliseum cheered to the echo. :
The president declared he was -trying
-to -weigh-carefully every word he
said. He reiterated that he hd been
daily charged to keep the countrv out
of war and also to uphold its hon
or.
"And many a night when it has
seemed impossible for me to sleep," he
said, "because of the apparently inex
tricable difficulties into which our in
ternational relations were drifting 1
have said to myself 'I wonder if the
people of the United States fully know
what that mandate means to me.' And
then sleep has come; because I knew
that there was r.ot a community in
America that would not stand behind
me in maintaining the honor of the
United States.
Difficulties Encountered.
"The difficulties of keeping America
at peace during this tijanic struggle
across the sea cannot be disclosed
now; perhaps it never can be dis
closed. How anxious and how diffi
cult this task has been. But my heart
has been In It. I have not grudeeri
a single burden that has been placed
upon me with that end in view. For I
know that not only my own heart but
tne neart of all America was in the
cause of peace."
There are actually men In America
who are preaching war, the president
declared, men who want the Unit
ed States to have entangling alliances
abroad. He said he did not think thev
spoke the voice of America which he
declared to be for peace.
He added that others go further than
he in advocating peace. "They preach
the doctrine of peace at any price," he
added, "while men in the audience
cried "Never! Never." He said these
men did not know the circumstances
of the world.
".America cannot be an ostrich with
its head in the sand," he said.
The president declared he hoped If
this war had no other result it would
create an international tribunal to set
tle questions which cause war. His
declaration that he had found the peo
ple or tne middle west for prepared
ness rlrcw long applause.
"Some one who does not know our
fellow, citizens as well as he ought to
know them, told me there was a cer
tain degree of indifference and
legarthy In the middle west, with re- J
gard to tne derense of the nation," he
declared. "I said I did not believe it
but was going to out to see. I have
seen what I expected to see great
bodies of serious men and women
coming together to show their interest
:n tne object or my visit."
Closed With Tribute to Flag.
The president closed with a tribute
to the American flag.
"As I look at that flag," he said, "I
seem to see many characters upon it
wnicn are not visible to the physical
eye. There seem to move ghostly vi
sions of devoted men, looking to that
flag though only of liberty of the
rights of mankind, of the mission of
America to show the way to the world
for the realization of those rights. And
every grave and every brave man in
the country would seem to have upon
it the. colors of the flag,- if he were a
true American would secyn to have
on it that stain of red, which means
the true pulse of blood, that patch of
pure white which means the peace of
the soul. And then there seems to
rise over the graves of those mri and
to ' hallow their memories that blue
space of the sky in which swim those
stars which exemplify for us the glori
ous galaxy of the states of the Union,
which stand together to vindicate the
rights of manljnd." - A ,

Here the president made the first of
four five-minute talks on , his day's
programme.
A great cheer went up when he ap
peared on the platform.
"It encourages me very much to have
you come in such numbers," he said. A.
call went up for Mrs. Wilson.
"She hasn't as much cheek as I
have," he said.
"I want you to feel the seriousness
of my mission," he continued. 1 want
you not to believe that the defense
movement is in interest of munition
makers.
"It seems to be supposed that a body
of munition manufacturers have to do
with the policy of the United States. I
have to discover such a situation.
"I need tell you I love peace pro
foundly and will do all I can to pre
serve it. But there may arise any
time a condition which will cause you
to ask why I do not protect the honor
of the United States. I must be ready
to do that."
