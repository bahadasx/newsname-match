PnEflTOENT'S SPECIAL. Topeka,
Kan., Feb. 2. President Wilson swung
Into Kansas todnv n ! . pulse of
the wheat belt on preparedness. Tho
President and Mrs. Wilson were early
morning visitors In Kansas Cltv for a
few minutes, while their cars .were be
ing switched from one track to another,
but not a vaat number of the citizens
knew that the distinguished guests
were among them.
President Wl'son nml party arrived
at Topeka at in o'clock today.
Fivo thousand persons preeted the
President at Lawrence when his special
train stopped for five minutes for a
rear platform speech on his way from
Kansas city to Torraa.

bast night th President experienced
the first real "MtcTi" on the trip thus
far. Through a blunder in Des Moines,
the Presidential special was not ready
when the Executive and his party ar
rived Rt the depot. The Preshlent and
.Mrs. Wilson waited for more than "fif
teen minutes in the dispatcher's ofTlce
ponding the arrival of their car.
"There Is a considerable body of men
who are trying to stir the very sort of
excitement In th's country, upon which
every true, woll-b'alanced American
ought to frown," the President said in
his Des Mpinos address.
Preaching For War.
"There are actually men' In America
who are preaching war. who are
preaching the duty of the United States
to do what It never has done before
seek entanglement in the controversies
which have arisen on tho other side of
the water abandon Its habitual and
traditional policy and deliberately to
engage In the conflict which Is now en
gulfing the rest of the world."
Probably the largest crowd Des
Moines ever saw greeted the President
on hs arrival at 6:50 over tho Rock
Island from Chicago.
In the home of Senator Cummins, a
possible opponent -at the next "lection,
he spoke not a word of the battle rag

scheme of Secretary Garrison and the
backers of Senator Cummins' Increased
national guard bill.
In his address here, the President
again attacked Hie reports that prepar
edness Is the child of the munition
makers. Tie called attention to his de
mand pn Congress, oven before the war
began, for an arrr.orplate plant owned
by the Government.
Police Asked to Locate Oscar
Ray dinger, Believed Victim
of Hard Study.
Search was Instituted bv the nollce
toduv for Osrar Rav Ollnger nineteen,
a freshman at Gallaudet College, who
disappeared from Kendall Green on Sun
day evening. Ollnger left tho college. It
has been learned, with a suit case and
a considerable sum of money, and It
was believed by the authorities of the
Institution that he had gone to his home
in Nashville. Tenu.
Inquiries there, however, dlsclpsed
that he had not appeared there. Ollnger
was a good student, and had an ex
cellent record at Gallaudet. He had
studied hard, the college authorities
say, and It is regarded as possible that
his mind was affected.
Ollnger Is 6 feet 5 inches In height,
with black hair and dark complexion.
He weighed about 130 pounds. When
he left Kendall Green he probably wore
a dark gray overcoat, with black vel
vet collar, and a blue suit, with whlto
pin stripes. He also wore a soft gra
hat, with black ribbon. He Is totally
deaf, but speaks fairly well.

SEEKS POSITIVE AGREEMENT
Semi-Official Statement Issued
Because of Alarming Reports
From English Sources.
BERLIN (via wireless to Sayville,
"Feb. 2. The German foreign office to
day transmitted to Ambassador von
Bernstorff at Washington Instructions
"which give 1-easonablo hope for a posi
tive understanding" on the Lusltanla
question, It was soml-offlclally stated
today.
The statement was Issued on account
of "alarming reports from English
sources regarding tho present nature
of German-American relations because
of the Lusltanla controversy.
"It Is true," says tho semi-official
statement, "that on fast Saturday the
3crman ambassador at Washington
cabled his government that he had
found It thus far Impossible to adjust
the Lusltanla case In a manner satis
factory to both sides by a friendly and
vorbal exchange of views.
"Today, Instructions were transmitted
to the German ambassador, which give
reasonable hope for a positive under
standing." The above semi-official statement from
Berlin corroborates an exclusive state
ment cabled the United Press Satur
day night by Carl W. Ackerman, Ber
lin correspondent. Ackerman cabled
that Colonel House would report to
Washington that Germany hopes to
clear up the entire Lusltanla contro

to Washington. Ackerman's dispatch
was the first from Berlin regarding the
probable German attitude u the- new

Wilson Must Make Next
Move in New Lusltania
Deadlock, Berlin Hears
By CARL ACKERMAN.
BERLIN (via Amsterdam). Feb. 2.
President Wilson must make the next
move In the present Lusltanla dead
lock. The solution of the new German
American . cpntroversy depends upon
the decision the President will make,
following the receipt of a full report
from Col. E. H. House, his confidential
agent, on the result of his conference
with German officials.
German officials desire that no Inti
mation of their attitude be cabled to thi
United States until this report is in
President Wilson's hands. But it was
learned today that Colonel House was
apprised of a new and recent change
of sentiment In Germany regarding re
lations with America. Germany, he was
told, Is today a solid unit . so far as
her foreign relations are concerned.
Officials and other German leaders
are most earnest In their desire for
American friendship. They are patient
ly and anxiously watching develop
ments, trusting that an agreernent mu
tually satisractory is possible.
The Cologne Gazette points out th-it
there can be an adjustment If good
will exists on both sides, Germany, the
Gazette declares, is showing this at
titude. EIGHfiJVESLOST

This Is a Georgia-grown storm, the

State Department Expected to
Hold the Appam as Prize or
Auxiliary of German Navy.
There is every Indication that the Uni
ted States Government will decide to In
tern the captured British steamer Ap
pam, which arrived in Hampton Roads
yesterday In charge of a German prize
crew.
Such a decision would be a victory
for tho German government, and would
undoubtedly result in warm exchanges
between the United States ond Great
Britain.
Tho status of a nrlez of war Is being
claimed for the Appam, according to the
first official report reaching Washington
today. This report came through from
Collector Hamilton, of the port of Nor
folk, and was Immediately forwarded
by Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
Peters to the State Department.
The only request made by Lieutenant
Berge, of the German naval reserve. In
command of tho Appam, was for a
temporary supply of provisions and this
has been granted.
Made No Captures.
The lieutenant has made no formal
application for a definition of his status,
but, according to the written report Is
taking the position of a prize of war.
The Appam participated in no cap
tures, and was not operated as a raid
er or auxiliary, according to tho Infor
mation given Collector Hamilton.
The situation with respect to those
on board the boat was complicated to
day by Information that some of tho
British crews on board served guns on
vessels that resisted capture by the

NORFOLK, Feb. 2. The former British liner Ap
pam, brought into port by a German prize crew of twenty
two men from the sea raider-Moewe, is tugging at her
anchor in Hampton Roads under the guns of Fort Monroe.
No visitors are allowed aboard nor will the United
States permit her 452 passengers to come ashore; The
object of a fleet of scurrying water craft, Federal authori
ties hold her incommunicado while her sjatus is being de
bated on two continents.
Collector Hamilton went aboard the Appam today for
0
the first time in his official capacity. He said that his visit
had to do solely with an attempt to learn conditions aboard
the Appam and the necessity for provisioning in order that
a report may be made to Washington.
Until the status of the vessel is established by the
Federal authorities, he said, the Appam will remain at her
present anchorage.
CORDON BLOCKS ESCAPE.
Whether she be German prize of war or converted
auxiliary cruiser of the imperial fleet; whether subject to
internment or restoration to her British owners and other
legal tangles, are being investigated at Washington.
Until these are settled she is a legal and actual pris
oner, for without the twin capes, it is reported, there is
gathering a cordon of British cruisers to prevent her pos
sible attempt at escape should the United States decide that
she-is a belligerent cruiser and entitled to the status of such
vessels.
In the meantime allied shipping is advised by consul
ates to remain in port while the cruiser squadrons of the
allies sweep the seas in search for the Moewe, the com
merce raider already responsible for the destruction of
seven vessels, according to passengers on the Appam, and
which is now believed to be carrying on its work of de
vastation in Atlantic waters.
While the Appam is held . incommunicado, supplies
necessary for the huge human freight were permitted to be
taken aboard.
MAY NOTIFY FRIENDS.
No visitors are allowed aboard the vessel. Yet in
spite of the driving rain sweeping across Hamp'ton Roads,
the rails were lined with passengers. Many confined to the
cabins begge dthat newspapers be passed to them, but the
officers of the Appam refused to grant permission for even
this.
Arrangements are being imade today to permit such
British subjects as desire it to send telegrams to relatives
or friends apprising them of their safety.
A flood of congratulatory telegrams from German
sympathizers in all parts of the United States was deliv
ered aboard the Appam to her present officers this morning.
The British consular officials also made arrangements
today for the return to England of passengers released.
That the ordfer permitting debarkation of the noncombat
ants will come by tomorrow was confidently believed. Vig
orous protests agamst further detention were'futilely made
by the passengers, many of whom were, still confined to
their cabins.
