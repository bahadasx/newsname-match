Three bandits held up the drug store

saw hte spectacle. Tugging at his hip
pocket to get out his revolver, he ran
to their assistance. Almost at the same

Hardly had the policeman stepped

the revolver of the three bandits poured

Treaties Being Studied to Determine
Status of Affair.
Washington, Feb. 2.—The state de
partment Indicated today that if the
liner Appam is held to be a prize, the
Prussian-American treaty of 1828 Is
more likely to govern the case than is
The Hague convention. This would
mean that the Appam wonld be turned
over to the German captors and in
that case some German officials ex
pressed the view that the prise crew,
rather than let her fall back Into the
hands of the British, might take the
ship to the three-mile limit and sink
her.
In case she is held to have become a
German fleet auxiliary she will have
the choice of leaving port after a cer
tain time for supplies or repairs or
Interned for the war, as have the Prtna
Eltel Friedrlch and the Kronprins
