The question of food and water was
no longer serious, as during the night

REPORT ORDERED
UPON COLOMBIAN
TREATYINSENATE
Washington, Feb. 2. Reducing the
proposed payment to Colombia from
$25,000,000 to $15,000,000 and altering
the proposed apology of the United
States for the partition of Panama to
make it a mutual expression of regret
on the part of the United States and
Colombia, the senate foreign relations
committee today ordered a favorable
report oa the long pending Colombian
treaty.
The vote on the treaty was eight for
to seven against. Senator Clarke of
Arkansas was the only democrat vot
ing ngainst it.
By a vote of ten to three the com
mittee also favorably reported the
treaty to pay Nicaragua $3,000,000 for
a canal route and naval bases in the
Bay of Fonseca.
The action of the committee today
means that the treaties will be brought
into the senate for ratification with the
full force of the administration be
hind them as part of its plan to fur
ther harmonious relations with all
Pan-America in consonance with the
broad general policy of Pan-Americanism
outlined by President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing at the recent Pan
American congress here.
The heavy light is expected over the
Colombia treaty. Such a change as the
majority of the committee now pro
poses to make will necessitate further
negotiations with Colombia which al
ready has accepted the convention on
the basis of the United States paying
$25,000,000 and expressing regret.
Some of the opposition to the treaty
is based on the report that Colombia
intends to use the money she would re
ceive from ffie'u'nited States for "of
fensive operations against Peru over a
long-standing boundary dispute. Pan
American diplomats see a connection
between that phase of the situation
and Secretary Lansing's proposal to
bind all the Pan-American republics
to arbitrate the boundary disputes and
to agree to suppress shipments of
munitions to revolutionists among

Reasons for
Big Air Raids
London, Feb. 2, (11:30 a. m.) A
Zeppelin was sighted today off the
coast of Ameland, an island of the
Netherlands, says a Reuter dispatch
from Amsterdam. It was flying low
and probably had lost its bearings
owing to fog.
The coast guard fired more than
fifty shots and it is believed that
some hit the airship, which finally
disappeared to the northward.
The Zeppelin air fleet returning
from Its raid on the English province
was heard in the vicinity of Amster
dam Tuesday. Officers of ships say
that five Zeppelins traveling west
ward were sighted.
Berlin, Feb. 2, (via London, 11:10
a jn.) Rumors have been circulated
here that the Zeppelin raid on Eng
land Monday night was in reprisal for
the Baralong affair but the Associated
Press correspondent is assured in
authoritative quarters that the attack
did not come under that head.
It is stated that the midland section
of England was selected for the raid
because it is the center of the muni
tions industry and because Liverpool
is the center of England's commerce
and that there was a purpose to bring
home to the people of Great Britain
the fact that the boasted defenses of
London do not avail against Ger
many's air craft. It was intended
also to interfere with the preparations
being made in England for the carry
ing on of the British operations in
France and Flanders.
The admiralty office reiterates that
not a single one of the raiding Zeppe
lins was injured.
MAKE REPORT ON
IOWA DRY REIGN
Des Moines, IowTa, Feb. 2. "Tem
perance conditions in Iowa, at least
as far as Davenport, Clinton and Du
buque are concerned, are far from
ideal," says a report made public to
day by a ttam of students of Cornell
college. The students have just com
pleted a survey in the three Iowa Mis
sissippi river towns of the effect of the
new state-wide prohibition law.
The report, published by the Inter-
collegiate Statesman, says that in the
three cities in question the church
people "seemed to be doing but little
outside of the usual church routine
and ordinary citizens do not know
what the temperance organizations
are doing."
"The chief points noted by the col
lege investigators," the Intercollegiate
Statesman says, "were:
"There is a strong anti-prohibition
sentiment in Davenport, Dubuque and
Clinton; temperance, educational fa
cilities are inadequate; lectures and
talks are confined almost entirely to
the churches. Public libraries are de
ficient in good temperance books."
BOAT EXPLOSION
KILLS FOURTEEN
Huntington, W. Va., Feb. 2. Four

COL. HOUSE IS CALLED
SPHINX IN A SOFT HAT
Paris, Feb. 2. The Paris press com
ments on the discretion of Colonel' E.
M. House, which is described as being
impenetrable and admirable.
The Excelsior publishes an article
on Colonel House and uses, as an illus
tration for it, a composite photograph
of the colonel, and the sphinx. It heads
the article "A Sphinx in a Soft Hat."
It says that the most experienced in
terviewers admit that Mr. Wilson's en
voy has baffled them as they had never
before been baffled.
A. Fitzmaurice, the foreign editor of
the Figaro says:
"As Colonel Hjuse has only visited
the capitals of the belligerent nations
most directly interested in the ques
tions of the blockade and submarine
warfare, one would not be far wrong in
believing that those questions form
the principal object of his Journey.
That he did not go to Vienna and that
he is in a hurry to return to America
may be due to the fact that the Lusi
tania situation has been growing more
acute."
Form Plans for Military Training.
Chicaeo. Feb. 2. A committee of
trustees, principals and teachers today

to formulate a course of military tac
tics in the Chicago public schools.
Proponents and opponents of the

INSTRUCTIONS IN
LUSITANIA GIVEN
TOAMBASSADOR?
Berlin, Feb. 2, (by wireless to Say
ville, N. Y.) Instructions have been
sent by the German government to
Ambassador von Bernstorff of Wash
ington of such a nature as to give "rea
sonable hope for a positive under
standing," concerning the Lusitania
affair, it was announced here today.
The announcement, which is of semi
official nature, is said by the Overseas
New agency to have been made, "in
connection with alarming English re
ports about the nature of German
American relations." The text of the
statement is given by the news agency
as follows:
"It is true that on Saturday, Jan. 29
a telegraphic report from the German
ambassador at Washington arrived at
Berlin, showing that up to that time it
had been impossible to adjust the Lusl
tania case in a manner satisfactory to
both sides by friendly verbal ex
changes of views. On Tuesday In
structions were transmitted by tele
graph to the German ambassador,
which give reasonable hope for a posi
tive understanding.
Washington, Feb. 2. At the German
embassy it was stated today that Count
von Bernstorff had received no in
structions from Berlin and that if such
instructions had been cabled by the
foreign office on Feb. 1 they would not
be expected here much before tomor
row. If the instructions come by cable
they will be transmitted through the
American embassy at Berlin, which at
the instruction of the state department.
has placed its facilities for communi
cation between Count von Bernstorff
and his foreign office at the disposal of
the German government, so that the
Lusitania exchanges would not have to
pass through the British censorship.
None of the embassy officials would
venture an opinion as to what the in-
istructions referred to as giving "rea-
sonable hope for a positive under
standing" although they expressed the
hope that they would be satisfactory
to the United States.
THE WAR TODAY
"Reasonable hope for a positive
understanding" between the United
States and Germany on the Lusi
tania issue Is felt in Berlin, ac

Bernstorff give rise to this hope,
it is stated.

with a salute of 21 guns and escorted
by state troops to the residence of
Governor Capper, whose guest he was
until 1 o'clock, when he addressed an
audience in the auditorium.
The president and Mrs. Wilsott rode
over snow packed streets in zero

cheered them at the station, but most
of the city's 50,000 population lined the
sidewalks along the way to the gov
ernor's residence.
Topeka, Kas., Feb. 2. President
Wilson told an audience of 5,000 per
sons here today that "America is not
going to abide the habitual or con
tinual neglect" of its rights under in
ternational law, either with respect to
the safety of its citizens or its foreign
commerce. "For one thing, it may be
necessary," the president said, with
an emphatic gesture, "to use the forces
of the United States to vindicate
rights ot American citizens everywhere
to enjoy, the rights of international
law.
"We must also insist on the right "
of Americans to trade with the world,"
he continued, "we shall respect any
blockade, but the world needs the
products of the United States and we
will insist that the world gets them."
The Philippines, the president said,
would be freed.
"That flag will come down," he
declared, "when we feel that the Phil
ippines can take over -their own af
fairs and no longer require our pro
tection; and it will be more honored
in the lowering than in the raising."
May 'eed to Use Force.
"For one thing it may be neces
sary," the president said in his speech
here today, "to use the forces of the
United States to vindicate the rights
of American citizens everywhere to
enjoy the rights of international law.
America is not going to abide the
habitual or continual neglect of these
rights," he added. President Wilson
also declared that the American flag
would come down in the Philippines,
as it had done in Cuba, "as soon as we
feel the Philippines can take over
their own affairs and our protection
is no longer required."
It was 1:18 o'clock whsn the presi
dent entered the auditorium. He was
greeted with applause as he rose after
being introduced by Governor Capper,
who said that if necessary at least
100,000 Kansas men would answer the
call of the government. Several thou
sand American flags were draped from
the ceiling. The audience stood and
cheered.
' The president declared he knew the
people of Kansas wanted to know the
facts before taking action. "You will
ask if there is some new crisis for my
coming here," the president continued.
"I answer no; there is no special new
critical situation which I have to dis
cuss with you, but I want you to un
derstand every hour is critical while
this great contest continues in Europe.
"It is easy to refrain from unneut
ral acts, but it is not easy to re
frain from unneutral thought.
Blames Americans.
"Some men of foreign birth have
tried to stir up trouble. But there
are also some men born here who have
tried to stir up trouble in America.
If you could listen to the counsels
dinned into my ears almost every day
at Washington you would find that
some of the most intemperate have
come from the lips of men who for
generations together have been identi
fied with America, but who for the
moment have been so carried away by
their sympathies that they have ceased
to think in terms of American tra
