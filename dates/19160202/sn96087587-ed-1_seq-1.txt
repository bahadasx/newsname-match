Use Hot Beds.
Every fnrni should have a little
garden. The farmer who "can
huy vegetables cheaper than he
cm glow them"si'!dom has fresh
vegetables on his table.
Uy using hot beds and cold
frames, fresh vegetables can be
grown for the table earlier in the
spring and later in the fall than
they can be grown in the open
garden.
One of our fi iends grows small
vegetables, as radishes, lettuce,
etc., in a hot- bed duridg cold
weather. Then, tomato plants
are grown to a large size in the
cold frames so that they ripen
tomatoes two weeks earlier than
plants set out earlier in the open
garden,
By
usingtho hot bed nnd cold
frames, this man has fresh veg
etables almust the vear round.

Ground Hoy Day. .
Today, Feb. 2. is ground hog
day and some say that if he sees
his shadows' he will go back into
the ground and stuv for six
weeks while others say that if he
does not see his shadow ho will
go back for six weeKS.
The day is bright and clear so
an opportunity will be given to
see what the ground hog does;
there will be no half way busi
ness about it this time.
