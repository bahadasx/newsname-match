?She a German Prize or a
?German Naval Aux
fritish Think They Have
Solved Where She Came
From.
(By Associated Pi-ess)
WASHINGTON, Fob- 2.?State de
partment officials indicaotd today that
* f. if tho captured steamer Appam finally
is held to.be a prize of the Germans,
the Prussian-American treaty of 1823
! is more likely to govern tho case than
ia tho Hague convention. Thio would
., moan that the Appam would bo turn
od over to her Gorman captors and
in that case German officials express
S^;>ed the opinion that tho prizj crew, ra
? tlier than let her tali back, into .Brit
ish .hands, aa would seem inevitable
if she left port, might take tho ship to'
jgjgthe three mile limit and sink her.
S-^ffln.case sho io held to have become
German fleet auxiliary she will have
choice of leaving port alter a csrtain
SWtij^for; supplies or repairs or intern
jra?tng' for' tho war as have tho Frinz Ei

visions which bear on it. Secretary
Lansing also considered tho case.

Will Need It; While: Their
New ESiflce% Build
ing.
A meeting'of the trustees of the
First Presbyterian' church was held
yesterday, at the o'fflce'of .Slayor Bow
en when matters, pdrtainingrto the raz
ing of the church edifice and securing
a place in which to worship during
the building of the new edifice, were
discussed.
The matter of securing a place In
which to worship after the old church
building Is .torn down was left to a
sub-committee composed: of Dr. J. W.
McDonald, Mayor Anthony Bowon and
Kenneth Barnes. The committee Is
to make Its report next Sunday when
the announcement will be' made at
the Sunday services.'
Several places are being-considered
by the committee which will make a.
complete Investigation as to which
will be moat central and best suited
to the needs of the. congregation and
Sabbath school. Among the places
considered are the Y. M. C. A. hulld
ing, the City Hall, the Grand Opera
House, the Masonic Temple, tho Yrm
ory and the Pythian Hall. From "pres
ent indications -the r committee will
likely select either the city uuilding
or the Y. M. C. A. building;
According to present plans the con
gregation will continue to worship in
the present edifice during the greater
part of...February.. .In.the, meantime
the parsonage will be razed,' having
already been vacated and the pipe or
gan 'will be dismantled and shipped
back to, the factory for a' omplete
overhauling! etc."
It is the intention to advertise for
bids on the structure'within'tne next
two weeks and the building'will not
be razed until' the bids are in and
opened. Work of razing the parson
age adjoining the. church building will
probably be started r.axi week.

REAL
Chirp of Robins Gives Way
to the Sound of
Shovels.
ALL TRAFFIC AS USUAL
Fall Is Heavy But It Has
Not Interfered With
Railroads.
The chirp of tho robins and the mol
odius song of the bluebirds of yester
day are superseded today by the Jingle
of sleighbells and the scrape of snow
shovels. Tho balmy breezes and the
cpring sunshine of tllj ^ast week
changed over night to tuo chilling
blast of a cold grey winter day.
Tho cold wave has been predicted
for more than a week, so nearly ev
eryone was prepared when it began
to Bnow last night shortly after eleven
o'clock. At eight o'clock this morn
ing four inches of snow had fallen
and the temperature was down to 21
degrees. Tho river stage this morn
ing was 20 feet and falling so nearly
all the snowfall is still on the ground.
The Groundhog was unable to see
his shadow today, and according to ths
popular superstition concerning the
myth of the groundhog, an early spring
is assured to this community. So if
this winter weather persists more
than six weeks it will cast a shadow
on the Groundhog's reputation for
veracity.
The heavy snowfall has occasioned
no disturbance of traffic on the car
lines in the county and the tracks are
being kept .cleared, of snow wherever
It is likely to cause any trouble. Men
tlon of the city officials, cleaning the
snow -from the street crossings and
bridges In the city.
Most of the residents of the city
take .pride in keeping their sidewalks
free from snow and those who do not
will be notified by.the street commis
sioner to do so at once.
The snow kept up all day and the
weather forecast Indicated that it
will continue throughout the night
