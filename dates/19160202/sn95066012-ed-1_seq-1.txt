property was caused. Other reports
said the Zeppelins were active at Man
Chester, a great Industrial center.
The text of the official statement
follows:
"An air raid last night was at
tempted on an extensive scale. It ap
pears that the raiders were hampered
by a thick mist. After crossing the
coast the Zeppelins steered various

The territory roughly outlined in
the British official statement might be
construed as including the city of
.Manchester, which is 30 miles from
the western coast of England, to the
east of Liverpool, about 1C4 miles
northwest of London.
With one exception. Sunday night's
raid caused the greatest number of
casualties of any since the beginning
of the war.
The official British statement shows
that the Zeppelins penetrated to the
heart of industrial England. Lincoln
shire is on the east coast. Its south
cm boundary 13 7,"i miles north cf
London Leicestershire adjoins it to
the southwest. Derbyshire is north
west of Leiscetitershire and Stafford
shire is to the west of Derbyshire.
These counties comprise a strip of
territory in mid-Kngland extending
more than 100 miles from the North
sea. Staffordshire and Derbyshire
have important manufacturing inter
ests. The other counties are given
largely to agriculture.
Sunday night's raid is the lath re
ported officially from Ixindon. The
first occurred on January 19 of last
year. The total of casualties report
ed previously was 178 .killed and 4;i
wounded, which, with the figures thus
far received from Sunday night's at
tack, brings up the number . to 232
killed and 03G wounded.

Grippe Epidemic Strikes Bennington
County.
"We're all knocked out at our
house colds, you know." It seems
to be the rult; from Dan to Beersheba.
The grippe germ landed first in Mil
waukee and travelled eastward. He
kept several thousand school children
at home in Chicap.o, caused fifty-three
deaths in three days in Cleveland,
12,000 cases In Philadelphia, 20,000
cases in Hartford, and now in found
iu Bennington County. Grippo is
everywhere.
Read the following extract from
the ' Monthly 1 lealth Letter published
by the Ufe Extension Institute of 5
West 45th St., New Vork, in connec
tion with their educational and Stand
ard Health Service:
Meeting Winter Perils.
Epidemic grippe is now causing
alarm. No doubt it will affect many
people and cause fickness and deatli
aniens jthose who invite it by neglect.
We have regularly to meet each win
ter a long range of affections of nose,
tin oat and lungs, from simple rhin
itis, or common ccld, to acute pneu
monia. It is probable that every com
mon cold leaves tiotne damage behind,
even though It may not lead to any
immediate fatal complication. The
damage may be very slight, but re
peated year after j'ear. it counts
among other, influences that gradual
ly wear out the body and lower its
efficiency.
How to protect ourselves, therefore,
net only from epidemic grippe but
from the long range of winter trou
bles that annually affect the majority
of the popaiation In temperate cli
mates', is one of the large problems
in personal hygiene. The proper
sanitation, 'ventilation and heating of
schools.-public buildings, daces cf
amusement, railrnad cars and other
public vehicles, offer some measure
of protection but proper home, con
ditions and the persona! care ofthe
body must be chiefly relied 'upon in
combating these acute and chronic
Infection':.
Over-crowding, Jack of sunlight,
hick of froi-'h air, and over-heating,
are often responsible for spreading
epidemic gi ippe and fi.r other infec
tive conditions of nose, throat and
lungs; oho, as is well known., for tu
berculosis. It is not alone the indus
trial classes that suffer Imm faulty
homo conditions.
In every household there should be
an accurate thermometer. It should
be someone's duty to watch the thei
tnoweter from time to time, and not
permit the temperature to rise above
70 degrees; preferably it should be
kept between G5 degrees ami GS de
grtej, With the skin and ( Irci.iatlon in
proper condition, draughts may
usually be defied, unless they strike
some exposed portion of the body,
such as extremities, or back of nock,
for a ptolonged period.
Dust is the aeroplane of the mic
robe. Old-fashioned , sweeping meth
ods are abominable. Wood floors
should be wiped or mopped with oil
mops. Taeked down carpets are not
hygienic. Those who .have. 'them
should use vacuum cleaners, or sweep
after scattering bits of moist news
paper or tea leaves to catch the dust.
During times of epidemic colds and
grippe, it is belter for those affected
to use squares of gauze or cheese
cloth, which can licylestroyed. instead
t.f handkerchiefs. Soiled handker
chiefs should be kept in bags and not
left exposed. They should lie boiled
before being put into general laundry.
Those who suffer from cough and ex
pectoration should use paper sputum
cups which can be burned. Spraying
of infectious secretions into the sur
rounding air by sneezing should, be
avoided. Sneeze into a handkerchief
or gauze.
Clothing.
Very heavy outer wraps should be
worn only in blizzard weather. Med
ium weight overcoats or wraps arc
less likely to create .sensitive skin
conditions that "soften" the individ
ual and invite colds. Chest protec
tors are worse than useless. They
might better be worn on the feet.
Thin-soled shoes are often responsible
forscolds. Rubbers should be worn
in wet weather, as few shoes are
really waterproof, and the cold, damp
soles may strike a chill through the
extremities. Open-work stockings
and thin-soled Bhoes worn by women
offer cordial invitations to colds and
grippe.
Skin Training.
To render the skin resistant con
temptuous, as It wero, of change in
temperature -is ono of the most im
portant steps inydisease prevention.
A hot spray taken . while standiug
in about a foot of hot water, followed
by a cool, or cold spray of a tempera'
hire that leaves one feeling a com
fortable warm glow, is a good skin
training measure.
Brisk rubbing of the skin with a
coavsa towel, and calisthenics before
dressing, will increase the benefit.
i An air-bath, or exposure of the skin
to cool air for a certain time each
day, is also -helpful. Fresh air in the
bed-room is all important, but beware
of baie feet on a cold floor.
Special Preventive Measures.
A thorough examination of nose,
mouth and throat, is most important.
Nasal obstruction, chronic catarrh,
j adenoids, infected tonsilrs, infected
tongue, gums and teeth, all invite
i nor' only colds and winter troubles,
I but other forms of chronic organic
disease J. '
Things To Avoid.
Nasal douches are, us a rule, to be
' uvoUKhI, except ot medical advice.
hreiiuent, violent . blowing of the
nose is also haruijful nnd unnect's
sary and if eprelei!y done by com

lection into the itiiddle car. Close

blowing gently
You cannot low
out congested and
(swollen bones and
tissues of the nose
and it is better
not to try.
If the throat is sore, stop talking;
spare your throat. Restrain cough
ing as much as possibhil You cannot
cough up a swollen-; congested
throat. Don't try you will only in
crease the inflammation.
Violent exercise should be avoided
during acute infections such as ton
silitls or grippe. '
Over-work and great mental or
physical fatigue lower resistance and
fbould be avoided, especially when
grippe is prevailenO
Constipation also favors the . devel
opment bf nasal congestion and pre
disposes to colds.'
Over-eating, especially. 'of meat, is
to bo avoided.
Heavy doses of whiskey and quin
ine and "cold-cures" are s'rictly to be
avoided. They often' exert ' unfavor
able, and at times, dana,'erms effects.
Alcohol lowers resistance to Infec
tion. If you wish an attack, drink it
freely. '
Tobacco, used freely, causes inflam
mation of the throat and invites the
attack of germs. t ....
Things To Do.
Call a physician promptly. Don't
Expect him to work miracles after
yoii have lost valuable time experi
menting with patent medicines. In
the interval, some simple' home rem
edies may bo used and are safer than
the marvelous "cures" sold in the
shopc
On the first sign of n cold, a hot
foot hath, lasting half an hour, and
a drink of hot lemonade will often
break its force.
A mikl, iuenthol-oil spray may lie
used occasionally in nose and threat.
Neck and chest and nostrils may be
rubbed with camphorated oil.
if the throat is sore, a gargle or
spray of peroxide of hydrogen one
part to three parts of water may be
frequently used.
Also cold compresses to the neclt
or gauze pads saturated with equal
parts of alcohol and xvater.
An alcohol rub-down is also good as
a first aid measure. Fsod externally,
'uholiol is a real friend. Infernally,
it b- a dangerous enemy. The spread
or septic sore throat and oilier germ
diseases by milk is very common.
Pasteurized . milk is safest during
epidemics.
1" there is severe headache, face
at he, earache, pain in the chest, sore
throat, or high fever, there should be
no delay in calling a physician.'

The annual musicale of the Fort

given by the Cadn.an Concert Com
pany of Boston, which includes Miss
Bertha G. Denny, contralto; Miss May
C. Powers, pianist. Miss Sylvia Fish
vif.linist and Mr. Henry Flagg, cellist;
four artists whose individual success
es are unquestioned. As a combina
tion they have unusual versatility rind
the ability to please all classes 'of
music lovers.
Their programs present only those
compositions that are of sterling
worth, and the one submitted to the
worth, and the one submitted to the
Foitnightly music committee for ap

instumental solos and trios and Miss
Denny will sing a group of songs, and
two arias, one from Suint-Saeus' opera
"Sampson and' Delilah," and the other
from Massenet's opera "Herodiade."
These arc among the moat beautiful
nils written for the contralto voice
and the fact that Miss Denny uses
them should be an assurance that she

Be Mentally Examined Before

f
Albany, Feb. 1 Harold S. Severy,
who said when arrested that he was
the son of .Melville Severy, a wealthy
inventor, living at the Uadeliffo Hotel
in l,cs Angeles, was positively identi
fied, tonight at the Albany Hospital
by John McCormaftfc and 15. C. Kenny
as the man who shot them down with
a silent gun In the streets of Albany
on last Friday night. Undr the
same conditions two other persons
were shot on Friday night, one of
whom has died. Albany has been in
terror for four days.
Severy, who says he is vaudeville
and movie actor, was arrested this
afternoon in a boarding house in
Schenectady after his landlady be
came suspicious of his constant tam
pering with a strangely-fashioned gun
ho kept in his room. She telephones
to the police and the arrest of Severy
followed.
"District Attorney Harold Alexander
of AlMmy County, after a five-hour ex
amination of Severy, said late to
night that after the prisoner had been
identiiied by two of his victims, he
admitted that he had done the i-hoot-
Ing on Fiiday, mentioning specifically
that he had shot a man In Chestnut
street. James Krwin, who has since
died in the Albany hospital, was shot
in Chestnut street.
For all that District. Attorney Alex
ander said that no murder charge had
been lodged against too prisoner. A
long, and rambling statement which
Severy made io Chief of Police Hyatt
and to the Prosecutor convinced them
that an examination of his menial con
dition should be instituted prior , to
any ptoeeedings of a criminal nature.

SPARGO ON "PREPAREDNESS"
Socialist Auther Discussed Timely
Topic at Y. M. C. A. Last Evening.
John Spargo, the noted socialist, de
livered a t'orty-minute talk on "Pre-
paredness" before. a small audience at
fhe Y. M. C. A. last evening; la vhich
he viewed naionn! armament from
the standpoint -of the anri'-miiitarisL
He said it would take more trans
ports than all the nations cf Hie world
could aggregate ; to move 3,000,000
troops across the ocean and invade
America, the number required to meet
a vomnteer army which America
could muster in the meanwhile. The
speaker also gave it as his opinion
that it would take 20 years to make
this operation successful. -He showed
the amount which America has ex
pended on armaments in the nast to
be about one-lnuulrei thousand mil
lions of dollars.. Most of the -equip
ment to show for it is How useless. He
called it "taking a c-iiancu" to oxnem
another hundred thousand millions for
a like purpose and stated that if the
country was going to "take a Chance'
it m i gut better do so Dy risking invns
ion inste'ad of increasing exnondi-
hires for wars which wni not come
unless the equipment is orovided In
fight, them. The same amount of
money spent for education and the
weuare or tne people he. thought
would be a better. investment.
He also stron.glv urired a. nnfimmi
deportment of peace as well as a de
partment of war, and showed that ir
the country had spent as much in cf-
iort to maintain, and foster peace as
in preparation for wr.r. there wni.M
never be another national conflict.. -
