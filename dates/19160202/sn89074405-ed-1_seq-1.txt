Talk on Cora.
At the morning session, J. O. Haney
gave an interesting address on corn,
in which he spoke of the difficulties
that face the farmer this year. He
declared that the growing of corn is
really a secondary matter, as It is
used in rotation to develop the land
so that better wheat yields will be
possible.
He emphasised the importance of
good seed, declaring that this year it
will be difficult getting it. He told
the farmers that they ought "to get
the seed from as near home as pos
sible and keep the corn grown from
this for seed purposes and use other
seed corn for growing fodder. In
this way the farmer will be able to
again obtain home grown seed cohi
again. He said that it ought to be
planted in well plowed ground as ear
ly in the spring as possible and
should be given good cultivating.
Small Grains.
W. R. Porter of the North Dakota
state agricultural college spoke on
"Varieties of Small a rains for North
Dakota." He called attention the
characteristics of the different varie
ties of wheat, oats, barley and flax
and said that it can be determined
which is the best variety for a given
locality, as the seasons and other
conditions vary to such an extent.
Marquis wheat, Mr. Porter deelar
ed, how Is considered one of the vary
best varieties for this state, because
It Is from two to ten days earlier
than blue stem, the latest wheat.
Marquis wheat is particularly good
because It does not Shatter an4 can be
left standing after cut. In fact It
ought to be left standing till it is
thoroughly ripe, otherwise it is too
hard to thresh. Blue stem shatters
easily, he said, and ought to be cut
on the g:°een side.
The speaker declared that Ode
broker barley is the best variety and
that Kherson or 6-day oats is the best
for this state.
A lengthy discussion followed each
address.
At this afternoon's meeting, J. H.
Sheppard of the state agricultural
college spoke on "Hardy Types of Al
falfa for North Dakota," and-J, -Q,
Haney talked on "Planting. Cultivat

Reveal to British People the

Against Aerial Raiders
Berlin, Feb. 2.—Rumors circulated here said that the
Zeppelin raids on England Monday night were in reprisal
for the Baralong affair, but the Associated Press corre
spondent is assured, in authoritative quarters, that the at
tack did not come under that head. It is stated that the
midland section of England was selected for the raid be
cause it is the center of the munition industry Liverpool
is the center of England's commerce, and that their pur
pose is to bring home to the people of Great Britain the
fact that the boasted defenses of London do not avail
against Germany's aircraft It is intended also to inter
fere with preparations being made in England for the car
rying on of British operations in France and Flanders.
The admiralty office has no further details to give out
regarding the raid, besides those already published, but it
reiterates the positive statement that not a single one of
the raiding Zeppelins was injured.

AMERMlTF
Petrograd, Via London, Feb. 2.—
The Novoe Vremya, in a leading edi

submarine warfare, characterizing
the proposal contained therein as use
less and incomplete and declaring
that it would "greatly hamper the
more honest captains of the commer
cial fleet of the allies and greatly
lighten the work of the Germans."
Would Tie Allies Hands.
The Novoe Vremya says that the
suggested rules would tie the hands
of the allies and at the same time
"open tremendous possibilities for
German misapplication," of these
rules. It cites "German disregard for
conventions."
Emphasizing the lndefiniteness of
the term "challenge" (warning) the
Novoe Vremya says:
"Von Tirpitz would be able to or
der his. men to challenge by merely
showing the periscope for a second,
and then sink the merchantman,
while, somehow, we think the allies
would be honest and send their chal
lenge enevelope."
The writer goes on to' say that on
the challenge of a submarine a mer
chantman would be compelled to ap
proach. whereupon the Germans
could sink her, and asks:
"Who would be found to prove who
was in the right?"
"Did the merchantman attempt to
run down the submarine or not?"
The Novoe Vremya continues:
"The allies have not a single pas
senger ship, so why have these rules
been thrust upon them The Ger
mans have already agreed not to sink
merchantmen, but Secretary Lansing
again puts before them the same
proposition. What is his object?"

The sinking of other vessels by the

Washington, Feb. 2.—State depart
ment officials indicated that, if the
Appam is finaly held as prize, Prus
sian-American treaty of 1828 is more
likely to govern the case than the
Hague convention.
This would mean that the Appam
would be turned over to her German
captors, and in that case some Ger
man officials expressed the view that,
the prize crew, rather than let her
fall back into the hands of the Brit
ish, as would seem inevitable if phe

the three mile limit and sink her.
In case she is held to have become

It is understood here that Lieut.

permit him to lay up the Appam in

Officials here are of the impression
that Berg will be informed that unless

Appam was admitted at Lloyds, as the.
case is an unprecendented one The
solution of the puzzle depends largely
upon the attitude of the United States
government, as to whether the Appam

German cruiser. She is considered a.
war loss by underwriters, however,
and it is believed tha.t she will not be
announced at Lloyds as having arrived
safely at port, as would have been
done had she completed her journey
