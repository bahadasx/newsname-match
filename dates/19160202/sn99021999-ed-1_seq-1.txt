CANNOT TAKE ANY CHANCES
NEW YORK, Feb. 1. The British
consul general here today notified
British shipping to watch out for
German submarines In American
waters. Information received at tho
consulate from private sources leads
them to believe that a submarine
had accompanied tho captured
steamer Appam on its voyage across
the Atlantic.
Consular officials would not say
n submarine had been sighted.
"In times like these we do not dare
to take any chances," It was said at
the consulate. While the report may !
be without foundation In fact we .
have deemed It best to take tho ac
tion that we did."

the German naval ensign fluttering boldly
from lta stern and in charge ef a Ger
man prise crew the British Houth African
liner Appam, given up for lost, took ref
it He in Hampton Pia ls this morning with
the atory of seven vessels destroyed by
German sea raiders off the African coast.
The Appam was captured off tho Ca
nary Islands on January 15 by a German
raider four days after it had sailed from
Dakar, Prltlah West Africa, for Plym
outh, England.
Lieutenant Berg of tho German navy,
placed on the Appam when It waa cap
tured, brought In the prise, eluding the
cordon ef British cruteera across the At
lantlo and adding to tha historic chapAee
of German exploits at sea. a chapter to
rank Willi the adventures of the Dresden
Karlsruhe, Prlns Eltel Frleflrlch, U-2 and
Kronprlns Wllhelm.
.Whether the captor was a German U
beat ,or a hitherto unreported German
auxiliary cruiser is undetermined. From
what was learned by some of the offi
cials who boarded .he Appam it Is be
lieved that some steamer, armed as a
German auxiliary, raiding shipping off
the African coast took the British liner
and put tho prise crew aboard. This
view Is supported by the fact that a sub
marine could hardly have spared a lieu
tenant and such a large crew to a prise.
Four Ilaadred Fifty Aboard.
There were a total of 4S1 persona aboard
the ship, including the surviving members
of the crews of seven other ships sunk
by the raider which captured the Appam,
and twenty German civilians wbo were
being transported from Africa to England
to be placed in detention camps. The
persons on board the veasel were listed aa
follows: Original members of crew, IK;
original passengers, 116; German prison
ers bound for British detention camps, SO;
survivors of ships destroyed, 138; prise
crew, 12.
A large iercentage of the number on
board are women and children and. It
