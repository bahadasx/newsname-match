Tlip investigations into the
qualities and various tests of
the coal shipped front Norfolk

thei Greek government hdvo ro
Stilted in the shipments reeently
made oil the ships commandeer?
ed for that government; These
agents have been in Norfolk tit
different times during the past
year quietly engaged in this
part of their work in the Coun?
try and while none of them
would commit Ihmnseiycs as to
the extent of theeoal shipments
to be made front lioro for thoir
government, yet it has I.n ro
liably reported that ail amount
around 150,000 tons will he
taken from Norftdk.
George .Me/.itis has lately es?
tablished himself in Norfolk as
the agent of the National < I reck
Steamship Line and when asked
liow Norfolk coal compared
with Welsh coal which was us?
ed in I! recce before the war, lie I
stated that so far as he could
learn, the agents of his govern?
ment hail found the fuel from
here to he entirely satisfactory
and, if anything stipei ior to any
previously used in that country,
lie said that he though! it was
true that many other (3reek I
ships had orders for this port
and that shipments to that
country would be active from
now on.
Mr. Mezitis is a well-educat?
ed man, being a graduate of tho
higher institutions of learning
of his country ami appears to
be rather familiar with the gen?
eral conditions there. When
bis opinion was asked as to the
inline course of Greece in the
present war he stated that Io?
was not prepared to say whal
would happen in that COUIinCC
lion, but that be knew the peo?
ple bad implicit confidence in
their king to guide the affairs
of the country in the way which
would prove to be the best;
It is the intention of Mr.
Me/.itis to act ;is an importing
and exporting agent in cohiiec
tiou with his agency of the
Greek ship lim- and after tho
war he thinks then- will be an
[opportunity to develop that
business bet ween Norfolk and
Iiis country. There is nothing
necessarily biguiticant about
the heavy shipment of coal,
grain and Hour from the (Utter
out ports in this country to
Greece at this time, lie says.
The previous sources of supplies

As Well.
Richmond, Va., January 28.?
The State Board <>f Uoalth is
sending but today to all the
railroads and to many of the
co u n t y superintendents of
schools brief printed warnings
against the spread of bad colds,
grippe and pneumonia, in an
elTort to acquaint the public
with tlie moans by which these
diseased are OOUVOyed.
Most of the railroads of the
State have already agreed I"
have the warnings posted in all
their stations, waiting-rooms
and passenger trains. The
hoard has likewise written to
each county superintendent a
request that he will notify the
board bow many placards he
wants in order thai one may be
posted in each school. Many of
(he superintendents have al?
ready replied anil have promis?
ed to see that the placards un?
distributed. Copies will be sent
Other superintendents as soon
as they will inform the hoard
of their willingness to oo-npei
ate in preventing the spread of
these diseases.
Separate School A
Necessity,
The Hoard of Visitors of the
V irginia School for the Loaf
and Blind, at their last meet?
ing, passed unanimously a
resolution, asking tin? Legisla?
ture to establish a separate
school for the blind lit some
Central point in Virginia.
The attendance at the present
school in Statin ton has doubled
in the last twenty years, until
at this lime the dormitories are
sOriously overcrowded, and
many u Uli clod children who
need the benefit of this inslitu
lion ate dented them for lack of
accommodal ions.
U is estimated that it will
cost but little, if any more, to
build a separate school for the
blind than to properly enlarge
the present plant, which is now
none too largo (0 Comfortably
provide fur the deaf children of
Virginia,
There are many reasons why
there should be separate schools
for the deaf ami (he blind, and
no reason to the contrary , There
is nothing in common between
the two classes except uflliplion.
They can not communicate
with each other, and liiere is
lacking between thorn all con?
geniality und sympathy. They
are taught by methods entirely
different ami are taught alto?
gether different trades and
professions.
All of the Stales of the Union,
bxcept six, have made litis sep
tiration, and all the educators
of the' two classes strongly
recommend separate schools.
The educational development
of the blind depends upon their
separate association.
The friends of these two
nfjlictod classes earnestly hope
that the Legislative will see tlie
wisdom and necessity of pro?
viding a separate school for the
blind children of Virginia.?

munities put the money, $501,.
214 of the $20,000,000 will be
spent en Virginia road by tlie
Federal government and an
equal amount by the State.
The chief opposition to the
bill came from the Republican
Bide ami from men who insisted
(his money should be spent for
military and naval prepared?
ness. This is the third time the

bill.
