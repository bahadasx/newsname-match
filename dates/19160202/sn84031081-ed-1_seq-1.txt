London, Feb. 1. A raid by six or
seven Zeppelin airships took place
last night over the eastern, south
eastern and midland counties of Fng
land. according to announcement of
the war office.
A number of bombs were dropped,
but it in declared no considerable
damage has been reported.
Fifty persons were killed and sixty
seven injured In las: night's Zeppelin ,
raid. ;
The figures were contained in an
official statement issued here this
afternoon. The official statement
says bombs were dropped at several
towns and in rural districts In Derby
shire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and
Staffordshire. Some damage to
property was caused.
The official text follows:
An air raid last night was at- 1
tempted on an extensive scale. It
appear that the raiders were ham-,
pen (I by a thick mist. After cross-1
ing the coast, the Zeppelins steered
various courses und dropped bombs
at several towns and in rural districts
in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lin
colnshire and .Staffordshire. Some
damage to property was caused. No
accurate reports were received until,
a very late hour. j
"Tli.i casualties up to the time of j
issuing the statement amount to
fifii .tour pe. som killed sind rxty
siven injured."
An additional statement was issued ;
this evening as follows: j
' Further reports of last night's
raid show that the evening's air at
tacks covered a larger urea than on
: ny previous occasion. Bombs were
dropped In Norfolk, Suffolk, Lincoln
shire, Leicestershire, Staffordshire
and Derbyshire, the number being es
timated at 20. i
"Except in one part of Stafford- 1
shire the material damage was not
considerable and in no vise was any j
military damage caused. No further
casualties have been reported." ,
With one exception, last nmht'si
raid caused the greatest number of
casualties of any since the beginning j
of the war. On the occasion of the t
bit siitacli on London, made on the
per-
night of October 13, fifty-five
sons were killed and 114 wounded, ,
according to an official statement.
Unofficial reports said the total!
was much greater, it being estimated (
by returning travelers tiKU neiwcen
HO and 300 persons were, killed.

Novel Legal Question.
As to the disposition of the Appam
herself, if sho is held lo be on auxil
iary cruiser, her commander will have
the option of putting to sea after a
certain time to make repairs and take
provisions. If she. Is declared a prize
the situation becomes more compVx,
and in that event it is admitted that
the I'nited States will have to deal
with probably the most novel ques
tion concerning its neutrality that has
arisen during the war.
As one of the first steps, the prob
lem probably would be referred to tho
neutrality .hoard which Is an official
body whose function is merely ad
visory. It was pointed out at the state de
partment that there is much confu
sion in the treaties and provisions of
international law on the subject of
prizes, the right to convert captured
Vessels into auxiliary warships and the
right of reclamation by the original,
! owners of captured vessels. I
Theories us to Title.
One theory largely held is that title j
to captured vessel docs not pass until;
(m nrivn eroirt has ridel. Another
opinion strongly championed is that
title passes immediately after
mie passes immeiuaieiy aiier me.
capture is made, providing the senior j
officers of the captors duly commis
sions one of his own officers or crew,
as the commander of the raptured
ship. The latter view is commonly ac
cepted by tho American navy and
probably would be followed by the
state department, though Secretary
Lansing said today he would have to
take time to consider the Important I
question involved before announcing a
conclusion.
Assuming that the American naval
view prevails, officials would see their;
way clear to her disposition under ar-;
ticle 21 of The iMague convention con
cerning the rights and duties of neu
tral powers in naval war.
This article permits prizes to be
brought into a neutral port on account
of unseaworthiness, stress of weather,
or want of fuel or provisions. A '
prize must leave as soon as the cir- ;
cumstanees which Justified its entry
nre at an end. If it. does not, the
neutral power must order it to leave
at once; should It fail to obey the '
neutral power must employ the;
means at Its disposal to release It,
with its officers and crew and to in
tern the prize crew. . .
A subsequent article enlarges the'
power of the raptor of a prize so that
he may bring the captured vessel in-:
to a neutral port "to bo sequestered
pending the decision of a prize court." .
But the United States at the time the i
treaty was made, expressly declined:
to accept this article and the debate
at The Hague showed that the Am-'
erican position was strongly opposed
to any such use of American ports as
receptacles of any prize. It was
pointed out that otherwise the I'nit-,
ed States would actually be made the
base of operations by one belligerent ;
acallist aliolller.
Ho if treated simply on Ihe basis
of a prize, without doubt the state
department would be governed by ar.
ticle 21 in the case of tho Appnm.
This would involve notice to Lieuten
ant Berge to leave Hampton Heads
just as soon as he could take needed
provisions or fuel and make his ship
seaworthy by absolutely necessary re
pairs. As several British cruisers are
without doubt already watching the
entrance to Chesapeake bay a speedy
recapture of the Appam would eem
inevitable.

Des Moines, Iowa, Feb. 1. Presi
dent Wilson, speaking hern tonight,
dealt with the futility of messages and
words of protest to meet breactu'H of
international law.
"Do you want the situation to be
such that a.l the president can do Is
to write messages und utter wordH of
protest?" ho asked. In advocating pre
paredness before Ihe largest audience
of his present trip,
"To ask that question is to answer
It." he said.
"Whenever international law Is vio
lated by one or the other belligerents,"
the president said, "America was
called upon to register a 'voice of pro
test, of insistence.'
"Do you want the situation to he
such that all the president can do Is
i to write messages and utter words of
1 protest? If these breaches of Inter-

The president's address was punct
uated Willi thunderous applause. lie
spoke slowly and gravely, with em
phatic gestures to enforce his words.
His declaration that the rni'eil Stales
wanted peace orew a quick response
and his assertion that self-respect of
the nation must be preserved, elicited
another great demonstration.
The president declared he was try
ing to weigh carefully every w'ord he
said, lie reiterated that he bad been
daily charged to keep the country out
of war and also to uphold its honor.
"And many a' night when it has
seemed impossible for me lo sleep,"
I he said, "because of the apparently

grucioiiH courtesy you have wulted to

Stales, but that, knowing the. errand
upon which he has come, you are
profoundly interested, us he is, In tho
candid discussion of' soma of tho
thmgs w hich concern the welfure and
tiie safety of tho nation.
"Some one who docs not know our
iellow citizens quite aa well us he
ought to know them told me that
there was a certain dcKreo of Indif
ference and lethargy in tho middle
west with regard to the defense of
the nation. I wild, t do not believe

have seen. I have seen what I ex

"My fellow citizens, it would bo
easy if I permitted myself to do bo
to draw a picture of the present sit
nation of the world' which would
deeply stir jour feelings and perhaps
deeply; excite your apprehension, but
yqu would not think that It whs rlKht
for your chief magistrate to speak
any word of excitement whatever. I
want you lo believe that In what I
say to yon ( am endeavorinK, as far
as extemporaneous speech will per
mit, to weigh every word that I say.
I said a moment ago that you know
the errand upon which I have come
to you, but do you know the reasons
why I have undertaken that errand?
There are some very conclusive and
imperative reasons. Some of our
fellow citizens are seeking lo darken
counsel upon this great, matter; I
hope and believe out of mistaken mo
tives, but certainly 1 believe not of
mistaken conceptions of the duty and
Interest of America.
"on the one hand there Is a ron
iih r able body of men who are trying
to nl if every sort of excitement In this
country upon which every true, well
balanced American ought to frown.
There arc actually men In America
who arc preaching war; who arc
preaching Hie duty of the Lulled
siales to do what II never would bo
I'ore seek, entanglements In the con
troversies which have urlsen on the
oilier Hldo of ihe water abandon Its
habitual and traditional policy and de
liberately engage In Ihe conflict which
Is now engulfing the rest of the world.
I do not know what the standards of
citizenship of these gent.emen may be.
I only know that I for one cannot sub.
scribe to those standards.
Country Is for hw
"1 believe that t more truly speak
the spirit 01 America when 1 say thai
that spirit Is a spirit of peace. Wh
l.o voice has ever come to any pub r
man more audibly, more unnilsuik-

"We ar,, counting upon you to keep
this country out of war.
"And l call you to witness, my fet
low countrymen, that I have spent
evd-v thought and energy that lutf
teen vouchsafed me in order to keep
this country out of war. It cannot bo
disclosed now, perhaps, It can never bu
disclosed, how anxious and how diffi
cult that task has been, but my heart
has been In It. 1 have nol grudged a
Ktngle burden that has been thrown
upon me, with that end iu view, for I
knew that not only my own heart, hut
Hie bean of nil America, was in the
