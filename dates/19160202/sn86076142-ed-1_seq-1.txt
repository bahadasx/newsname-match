DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WITH POPE RESUMED
Ulr Aaaeclaleil Preaa.)
ROME, Feb. 2. Not since the fall of
the temporal power of the Pope some
forty-six years ago have there been so
many attempts of hitherto indifferent
countries to re-establish diplomatic
relations by the sending of ministers
to the Vatican, In addition to those al
ready accredited by the government
of Italy at the Quirinal.
England and Holland have renewed
diplomatic relations by sending minis
ters to the Vatican, while French is
thought to be represented through the
Principality of Monaco which Is the
latest to renew old relations. Of course
since the entrance of Italy Into the
war, the Austrian ambassador to the
Vatican left, as well as the ministers
from Prussia and Bavaria, respective
ly the Baron von Ritter and the Baron
von Muhlberg.
While these three countries just
named did not in any sense break
their relations with the Vatican; per
haps even now try to keep in better
connection that ever, It was impossi
ble for them to remain openly here
due to the peculiar position of the
Holy See.
England has never had a permanent
representative to the Vatican until the
recent coming of Sir John Howard
formerly British minister to the
Hague, England having in past times
appointed special agents to deal with
the special religious questions affect
lng her Catholic populations.
