Defends Secretary Itomiels, Putting
Hlame on Meyer.
Washington, Jan. 2?.-Secretary
Daniels was praised as "one of the
greatest secretaries tho navy ever
had," and former Secretary Meyer
was assailed by Chairman Tillman,
of the Senate Naval Committee, in a
speech on "the truth about the navy."
Senator Tillman took Mr. Meyer to
task for hts recent d?claration be
fore the National Security League;
that "the fundamental defect of the
navy department is that it has no
brain and no competent military or
ganlzatton,
"Mr. Meyer forgets," said Senator
Tillman, "if he ever knew, that when
he left the navy it was nearly (1,000
men short; that 4 0 per cent of the
men discharged in good standing
were leaving the navy, while 85 per
cent are now re-enlisting; and that
during his incumbency there were
10,360 desertions. Yet he has the
cheek to hold his successor responsi
ble for conditions which are due
wholly to his own shortcomings. As
against 10,360 desertions while Mr.
Meyer was secretary, so far -about
.two and a half years-there have
been only 4,375 since his sucvossor
entered office."
No Pampered Darling.
"The head of the navy himself is
not a pampered and petted darling of
Inherited wealth, but a red-blooded,
upstanding, forward-looking Ameri
can who is a graduate in the hard
school of experience and a practical
man with wholesome ideas."
Senator Tillman praised other
officers of the navy who, he said, were
"not known at all In the drawing
rooms In Washington or Newport."
"While Germany had already won
second place, as shown by von Mey
er's first report," said Senator Till
man, "he never could persuade his
party-he tried only half-heartedly
to grant money enough to-recover
the lost ground. It is true the pro
gram he recommended in 19 09 was
quite respectable in size, but his par
ty associates, who are now clamoring
for the Democrats to make good Re
publican deficiencies in a na>'al pro
gram, did not give him the money.
So that it is proven beyond possibility
of dispute that the Republican party
is solely responsible for our present
status-lack of officers, lack of per
sonnel and lack of ships.
"It means a great difference whe
ther ono ls on the inside looking out
or whether he is ont the outside look
ing In."
The "Profs." Will Play Basket Ball.

100, DEAD IN VALLEY FLOODS.
Grout Area in Southern California
Desolated by Water.
San Diego, Gal., Jan. 23.-One
hundred lives have been lost, as
nearly as any estimate can show, and
valleys for fi0 miles north of the Mex
ican line lie desolate to-night from
floods and cloudbursts.
With the death toll in the Otay
Valley seemingly established at 50,
reports reached here late to-day ol'
floods sweeping the San Luis Rey
and San Pasqua) valleys, doubling
the loss of life. With communica
tion almost cut off lt was impossible
to list accurately the number of dead.
Seventeen bodies were taken out of
San Diego Hay before nightfall.
These had been swept down the Otay
river when the lower dam went out
last Thursday. The current was
thought to have carried many others
out to sea.
San Diego is virtually undamaged.
Many injuries were reported from
Tijuana 'Hot Springs, where a hotel
collapsed. A cloudburst, reports had
lt, caused the flooding of the San
Luis Rey and San Pasqual valleys.
The town of San Pasqual was said to
have been wiped out.
All ordinary means of communica
tion and relief were gone with no
prospect of early recovery. Only the
sea remained, and from it nld began
to come. An expedition from the
United States warships in San Diego
Bay was started in launches for the
Otay Valley. Reports are that the
first landing party had been1 unable
to penetrate the valley for reasons
not given.
An overland expedition also was
started from San Diego with pon
toons and engineering equi omen t. No
word came as to tts success.
