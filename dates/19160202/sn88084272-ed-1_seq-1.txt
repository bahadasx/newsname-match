Court of Criminal Appeals
Overrules Last Motion;
Says "Am Innocent."
Mrs. Agnes Orner charged with the
murder of her 11 year old daughter. L.11
lle, after five years' imprisonment and
upon the conclusion of six trials In west
Texas district courts, was notified
Wednesday morning that the njotion for
a rehearing in the court of criminal ap
peals at Austin had been overruled and
that her sentence of 99 years in the
state penitentiary was final.
The news was brought to Mrs. Orner
by Mrs. M. DeCourcy, matron of the
county jail, and was received without
any demonstration save the exclama
tion. 'I thought that's what they would
do."
Home In Cell.
As the cell door opened Mrs. Orner
stepped from her improvised apartment
with Its canvas hangings. She was
quiet and showed little emotion. "I'm
tired of all the courts," she said. "Five
years In Jail will break anyone's spirit
I might appeal to the supreme court of
the United States, but I will not. It's
useless. Instead I shall now seek a
pardon as I am not guilty of the crime
that has been charged against me.
Would Have Killed Self.
"If this w'ord had come to me five
years ago that I must spend the rest
of my life in prison I probably would
have killed myself in despair. Now I
do nothing. I don't even feel anyt
thin? yet it's too awful to think
about. Yet I have the reassurance
that I am not guilty. It Is a terrible
thing to say that a mother killed her
child. I loved my little girl more than
anything In the world and. whether
I am freed or sentenced, nothing can
replace her In my Ufa"
Team Anneur.
The calm that the prisoner showed
at first broke down at the thought of,
her child and her eyes filled with tears.
"I have bean in prison for five, years
this February," she said. "Hlrat there
was the hearing In El Paso in 1911:
then aadUrlai in. Matfa-Jn ltl i
w inn vi iuc jumia waic iur my ac
quittal; third there was the trial In
I'ecos, Texas, when eight of the jurors
were for my acquittal; next came the
fourth trial In Midland, during Febru
ary, 1913. when eight of the jurors
were for my acquittal. Fifth came the
trial In Van Horn in October of 1913,
when eight of the jurors were for my
acquittal; and then came the sixth trial
in El Paso when a year and a half ago
a verdict of guilt ywas returned against
me.
Fnther a Lawyer.
"All the way through, with the ex
ception of El Paso, the Jurors were in
the majority for my acquittal. They
knew that I was not guilty. I have
followed the case so Intensely that I
could get up and argue it through.
My father was A. F. Seastone of Chi
cago and one of the best criminal law
yers of Illinois. I used to assist him
as a girl of 18 and, because of that
early familiarity with the law, I have
been frequently counsel to my attor
ney" "Have you any stateniont that you
care to make for the public?" Mrs.
Orner was asked.
She replied: "I hope that those
people in El Paso who have falsely
testified against me will get their re
ward for, they have worked upon me
an awful injustice."
Fear Breakdown.
Jailor "Buck" Elliott hesitated in
communicating the action of the court
of the appeals because, when Mrs.
Orner was told that the same court
several weeks before had affirmed the
decision of the lower court, she fainted
and almost nad nervous prostration.
She received the news with calmness,
but the matron of the Jail said: "I
fear that she will have a reaotlon and
a breakdown."
At the slierlffs office It was staKid
that she would be taken to prison with,
the next lot of prisoners.

i g How the captured British
steamer Appam was lined with
bombs which could be touched off by
the German prize crew at any sign of
an uprising among her 400 captives,
waB told by persons on the ship to
quarantine officer McCaffery and he
related the story today.
"According to stories told me by pas
sengers," said McCaffery, "many bombs
are planted aboard the ship and all
of them can be exploded by the touch
ing of a secret button. The bombs
were placed by the Germans immediate
ly after they took possession of the
boat. The Appam's commander, Capt.
Harcjson, and the other English offi
cers were warned that any attempt to
overpower the prize crew would re
sult in the ship being blown up.

PaxsencerH Avralt Keleaw.
While the United States considers
what treatment shall be accorded her,
the former British passenger liner Ap
pam swings at anchor off Fortress
Monroe today, with passengers and
crew and the crews of seven sunken
British vessels restlessly awaiting lib
eration Irom their long confinement
under guard of a German prize crew.
Until orders come from Washington
no one will be permitted to land except
Lieut Heine Berg, the prize crew's
commander.
It is understood here that Lieut
Berg has asked that the United States
permit him to lay up the Appam in
Virginia waters as a fair prize of war,
liberating at least all of the civilian
passengers who were aboard at the
time of capture.
Hotv Appam AVa Captured.
Pilot Foster, who brought the Ap
pam into Hampton Roads, told the
story of her capture ae It was related
to him by Capt Harrison. He said:
"It was a bright clear day when
we were captured. We- were moving
alung at a fair rate of speed, when
suddenly in the distance 1 saw what
appeared to De an ordinary tramp
steamer. Gradually she came closet.
V7e did not fear her, and continued
ahead with no attempt to escape. Nor
did we make preparations to combat
her, as we certainly expected no at
tack. Battery Is Unmasked.
"Suddenly the tramp fired a shot
across our bow from a small gun. I
immediately hove to. As I did, the false
forecastle head made apparently of
flimsy material, fell away and revealed
a battery of huge guns.
"Resistance was useless, so we sur
rendered. "Once aboard the Appam, the German
prize crew, under the protection of the
battery of guns of the raider, immedi
ately disarmed the Appam crew and
locked them In various cabins. A sim
ilar precaution was taken with the
passengers.
Sautlves Are Liberated.
"In the course of this work, the 20
German captives who were being taken
to England were discovered. They were
liberated, that they might help the
crew in taking charge of the liner.
"When the race for Hampton Roads
started a member of the prize crew was
stationed at the wireless for the pur
pose of receiving all messages, but to
send none. By this method, tho where
abouts of the British cruisers were al
ways known, and we steered far out
of reach The crew and passengers of
