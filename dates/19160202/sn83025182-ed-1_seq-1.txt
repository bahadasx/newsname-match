[United Press Leased Wire Service]
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 2.—'Wireless
stations at all points along the coast
were today signalling steamers in the
vicinity of Cape Race seeking further
information as to the steamer, sup
posed to be the Japanese boat Takata
Miru, reported at midnight to be in
sinking condition.
The Takata Maru was In collision
with the tank steamer Silver Shell.
The last wireless from the Japanese
boat was to the tanker and declared
she needed help badly.
"Trust you will stand by," the
message added.
The Silver Shell wirelessed all
coast stations to advise passing ves
sels to watch for them as both ships
were headed into port. The last lo
cation given by the Silver Shell was
off the Virgin banks.
The Silver Shell wirelessed Halifax
early today that she launched several

Charleston wlrelesb operator early to
day, "was last night at 10:30. At that
time we picked up an S. O. S. call

"At 11:30 we picked up what was

"In the meantime one ship had sig

that they were in latitude 43.46, longi

of the other vessel, nor how badly

Conflicting Reports.
HALIFAX, N. S.. Feb. 2.—Conflict
ing reports regarding the probable,
fate of the Japanese steamer Takata
Maru and the American steamer Sil

reached here today.
A dispatch from Cape Race report
ed receipt of a wireless message early
today reporting the engine room and
stokehold of the Takata Maru flooded,
but that the Silver Shell was stand

Cape Race dispatch said reports that
the Takata Maru was sunk, probably
originated from the fact that she
could not use her wireless because
her engine room was flooded.

NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 2.—Apparently
conclusive evidence that the German
sea raider Moewe which captured the
British liner Appam and sank seven
other British merchantmen, is not a
ship of the regular German navy, but
a member of the naval auxiliary
forces, was submitted today.
Lieutenant Bcrge, commander of the
prize crew In charge of the Appam,
today produced a commission In the
naval auxiliary reserve. Lieutenant
Berge presented his commission duly
executed by the German government,
as an officer in the German naval re
serve to German Vice Consul Von
Schilling. It was learned today that
members of the twenty Germans com
posing the Appam's prize crew wore
hat bands labelled "-Moewe."
How the Appam eluded British and
French cruisers patrolling the Atlan
tic, also developed today. In addition
to keeping the British colors flying
while speeding across tho Atlantic, it
was reported that the Germans had
forced British papers to present if
halted. Although Lieutenant Berge
denied that any vessels had halted
tho Appam, other reports were that
the Appam had been spoken to and
lnjuiries made by wireless regarding
her identity when suspicion was
aroused from the painting out witfc
black paint, of her name on stern
and bow.
The German crew made evasive, but
satisfactory answer to the Inquiries,
giving a fictitious name for the ves
sel, it was stated. Her long bulk dim
ly seen from shore, bobbing fcbout in
the fog and rain, the Appam, whose
arrival yesterday after a hazardous
voyase from the coast of Africa, re
vealed a new and thrilling chapter in
the storv of the present war, awaited
today for the United States govern-,
ment to say what should be done with
l\er. Aboard, 452 British prisoners, in
charge of forty-two Germans, awaited
permission to come ashore. I
Whether.the ship is to be declared
a German privateer, subject to intern
ment, or a German prize, subject pos
sibly to internment or release to her
British owners, was expected to be de
rided during the day upon orders from
Washington.
Collector of the Port Hamilton said
that the Appam would probably be
taken to Newport News to discharge
the non-combatants.
Communication with tho Appam was
under strict prohibition today. Port
authorities called on the Norfolk
navy yard commandant for a guard ot
marines to be placed aboard the ves­

man and British combatants. Lieu
tenant Berge, commander of the Ger
man prize crew, had an appointment to
day with Collector Hamilton and Ger
man Consul Schilling to prepare a for
mal statement regarding the German
claims to hold the vessel.
Prince Hatzfeldt, counsellor of the
German embassy, arrived at Old Point
Comfort on this morning's boat from
Washington, to take charge of the
German Interests.
With the German naval ensign still
flying at her stern, the Appam's an
chorage Just off Old Point Comfort in
the roadstead of Hampton Roads and
only a quarter of a mile away from
tho huge battery of Fort Monroe, re
mained unchanged today. She was
the meoca for a fleet of harbor craft
who vainly sought to shout conversa
tions with the few passengers who
lined the rails, braving the rain which
swept the harbor this morning. It
was reported that most of the passen
gers were still being kept under par
tial restraint under strict military
discipline of the German crew which
brought her over 4,000 miles across
tho Atlantic.
Lieutenant Berge hinted today that
the German contention will be thai
the Appam is a German war vessel
and entitled to internment, rather
than a prize of war, subject to re
lease in neutral waters. Seeing the
prize possibly slipping from their
grasp by the technicalities of mara
time law, the Germans apparently
changed their position to prevent their
remarkable exploit from proving a
boomerang.
Hardship aboard the ship, due to
the shortage of provisions, was
averted. Collector Hamilton is per
mitting: supplies to be given the ves
sel and medical attention Is provided
for three men injured, from veesels
captured by the mysterious raider
Moewe.
Immigration Commissioner Morton
went aboard the Appam early today to
line up the various crews and arrange
for their transfer to shore, with such
passengers as are found entitled to
liberation. Ho said seventy-six ol
thoso on board are without funds. The
British vice consul is arranging to re
turn the passengers and crews to Eng
land on board British ships In tho
harbor.
