SAFE BURGLARS
ROB POST OFFICE
AT MOUNT HOLLY
Fire Three Charges of Dyna
mite and Get Away With
S2OO in Money and Stamps
FOUR MEN IN PARTY
Office Was Robbed in Exactly
Similar Manner .lust Two
Years Ago Today
Special to the Telegraph
Carlisle, Pa., Feb. 2.—Burglars early
this morning forced entrance to the
post office at Mount Holly Springs and
lilew open the safe, firing three
charges of dynamite in the operation.
The thieves secured S2OO in money
and stamps, and made their escape.
The first explosion was heard shortly
after 1 o'clock and awakened Mrs.
Philip Tlarman and her sisters, the
Misses Ida and Jane Craighead, who
live next door to the post office. They
went to a window and could look Into
the office, where they saw. the men
at work. There were four in the gang,
three ta'.l men and one rather short.
All were muffled up in heavy over
coats. Two of the tall men watched
at the post office door while the others
worked.
One charge of dynamite failed to
break the safe, and two other shots
followed, the third one being lired fif
teen minutes after the first. The of
fice clock stopped at 1:11 and it is
thought that fixes the time of the
first shot.
The three women in the adjoining
house were ton much frightened to
give the alarm and were afraid to go
down to the first floor of their home,
where the telephone was located. The
noise of the explosions was heard by
people of tlie town, but many thought
somebody was shooting at petty
thieves, as small robberies have taken
place in the town recently.
Miss Alice Mullen is the postmistress
ami she lives about a block nway, in
Baltimore avenue. She was awakened
by the explosion and telephoned to
the neighborhood of the office, but
• ould get no information In reference
to it. The robbery was not made pub
lic until about '• o'clock this morning
when Miss Mary Franeiscus, the as
sistant postmaster, opened the office
and discovered tlie wreckage and gave
the alarm.
The robbers broke open the black
smith shop of William H. Thomas, In
Baltimore avenue, not fur from the
post office and stole a monkey wrench,
a screw driver and an iron bar, with
which they pried open the rear door
lo the post office.
Mount Holly's post office was robbed
and the safe blown open in an exactly
.similar manner just, two years ago to
night—February 2, 1914. The thieves
at that time stole tools from the same
blacksmith shop and went about their
work just as they did this morning.
After securing their plunder the
thieves went down the street toward
the tracks of the Reading' railroad and
it is believed they boarded a freight
train on that road in the early hours
of the morning in getting away.
Post Office Inspector A. 8~. Craw
ford, of Meehanlcsburg, was notified

Question of National Character
Raised by Speaker at
C. of C. Luncheon
A SPENDTHRIFT LAND
Modern Young Man Too Proud
to Take His Girl on the
Balcony?
Edward A. Woods, of Pittsburgh,
president of tlie National Association
of I.ife Underwriters and an accom
plished after dinner speaker of na
. tional leputation, addressed a large
i gathering of Chamber of Commerce
i members at the luncheon hour at
ifhe Harrlsburg Club to-day. Mr.
Woods' talk was on the subject "Am
erican Extravagance, a National Prob
i lem," ijnd his clear, forceful analysis
>ol' (he rational mind and lack of
; thrift a:. a whole was in itself an
i education and u revelation.
The speaker was introduced by K.
J. Stackpole. who spoke of the great
service Mr. Woods had rendered to
the people of this nation when his
energy p.nd influence, were largely re
sponsible for preventing the passage
of the law which would have meant
taxation upon the beneficiaries of
lite insurance and an unjust burden
upon those whose need of support is
greatest to the women and children.
Spendthrift Nation
The trend of the speaker's remarks,
which were closely and attentively fol
lowed by an interested audience, were
toward a tearing aside of the false
attitude which we as a nation have
with regafd to our national wealth.
The strength of a nation, said Mr.
Woods, lies not in its wealth, as
money and possessions. but in the
character of its people. Rome began
to decaj when she became wealthy.
Nine out of every ten men in turn
country leave the world poorer than
when they acme into it, which is
equivalent to saying that only one out
of every ten individuals in the United
Stales are really thrifty.

structions have been sent by the Ger
man government to Ambassador Von
ernstorff of • Washington, of such a
nature as to give "reasonable hope for
a positive understanding" concerning
the Lusitania affair, it was announced
here to-day.
The announcement, which is of a

"in connection with alarming Bnglish
reports about the nature of German-
American relations." The text of the
statement is given by News agency
as follows:
"It is true that, on Saturday, January
2!». a telegraphic report from the Ger
man ambassador at Washington ar
rived at Berlin, showing that up to
I that time it had been impossible to
adjust the Lusitania case in a manner
| satisfactory to both sides by friendly
I verbal exchanges of views. On Tues
day instructions were transmitted by
telegraph to the German ambassador
which give reasonable hope for a pos
itive understanding."
