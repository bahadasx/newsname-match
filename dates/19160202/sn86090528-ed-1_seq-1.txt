CLAYPOOL
IS STRONG
FOR HARRIS
Members of G. 0. P. Central Committee of
District Meet Here to Decide Date
and Time of Holding Congres
sional Convention
DUNCAN MAN TAKES
FALL OUT OF FIELDS
Lands on Former Candidate lor Governor
for Favoring McGraw in Preference
to "Jim;" Says Teddy May Be
National Nominee
Members of the Republican centra!
committee for this district met this
afternoon in the offices of Eugene
Hamilton, United States commission
or, in First National bank building,
Chickasha, for the purpose of calling
convention for tho Sixth congression
al district and to decide on the place
and the date of holding the same.
John M. Claypool of Duncan, mem
ber of the coi!rat;t:9 from Stephens
county, was one of the earliest of all
early arrivals.
Mr. Claypool stated this morning
that he is here as an active repub
lican, working in the interests of har
mony in the republican ranks and tc
further the victory which he feebs
sure the future holds in store for the
'O. O. P.," both nation-wide and in
Oklahoma.
"I am also here," said Mr. Claypool,
in the interests of the candidacy of
James A. Harris of Wagoner for re
election to the position of national
committeeman from Oklahoma.
'Jim' Harris, as those who ,know
him love to call him, has clone much
for the republican party In Oklahoma.
He Is knwn nationally, has been ,t
worker in national politics, has made
good as national committeeman and
deserves re-election.
Harris is opposed for the position
by J. J. McGraw of I'onca, who s b-
ng groomed by John Fields, candi
date against H n. R. L. Williams for
overncr of the state of Oklahoma.
'In this connection I desire to say
hat the rank and file of the republi
can party in Oklahoma feel grieved
at this action upon the part of John
Fields. When the voters of the re
publican party picked up John Fields
and made hita their foreman, set hm;
upon a pedestal and turned heaven
and earth ia an honest endeavor to
lect him governor of this great state,
and when later they saw fit to make
him a mouthpiece for the party, they!
had little or no reason to fear, much 1
ess to think he would pull a stunt
uch aa he is now pulling.
'Jim' Harris' friends are among
the masses; the supportt.-s cf th:s
man come from the two-room lmx
houses and tho forks of the creeks;
they nre men who constitute the bone
and sinew of the republican party in
Oklahoma. And these friends of 'Jim'
Harris are the fellows who voted for
John Fields for governor, who voted
for him, many of them, on account
of 'Jim' Harris, and they are feeling
none too kindly toward Mr. Fields on
account of the stand he is taking in
'hand-riding' McGraw for national
committeeman from Oklahoma.
"I have been a Harris supporte
from the beginning of the campaign
and I want to say right here and now,
that Harris will not only carry the
state with a sweeping vote in the con
vention, 'out he will carry every dis.
trict in the state. I make this predic
tion premeditatedly.
"Practically every Bull Moose
'Roosevelt supporters,' we now call
them, in Oklahoma, Is Bupportins
'Jim' Harris for re-election as national
committeman. Alva McDonald, state
chairman of the progressives in Okla
homa, is supporting Harris. Ho is do
ing this on account of the fairness
with which Hani3 treated the follow
ers of -the 'Big Bull' at tho Guthrie
convention in 1912.
"Harris is going to be re-clcted.
The loyalty ot his friends, tho loyalty
of the republicans in Oklahoma ia go
ing to do that. We are all loyal to
Harris. Were I to receive a wire, or
a phone call, frm 'Jim' Harris at this
very moment asking me to start om
for the northernmost sections of irozen
Alaska on foot, I would not hesitate

BRAZIL MAY
BE MARKET
FOR COTTON
Short' Crop of Staple There and Exactions
of Combine Cause Demand for Re
moval of Tariff Wall that
Impedes Imports
SPINNERS FORCED TO
PAY FANCY PRICES
Operators Working Half Time and People
Feel Pinch of High Cost of Clothing;
Legislation for Reduced Duty
is Now Pending
By United Press.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 2.1.-(By
Mail.) Brazilians now paying big
prices for their cotton goods believe
there is a cotton combine here, hich
is taking advantage of the r.hort
Northern Brazil crop to boost prices.
The people believe a lower tariff
ouId permit American cotton tj
come In and bring prices down. Leg
islation is now ready for passage look
:ng toward this lower tariff and Unit
ed States cotton growers may find
a big market to take the place of the
European markets they have lost.
Brazil wears cotton. Not only wears
it, but grows it. There are more than
three hundred Brazilian mills manu
facturing it. These mills employ 75.
COO operators. Therefore, when a two
years' drought in the northern state
reduces the crop by half and make
the textile industry pay an exhorbit
ant price for it, the Brazilian ait
up and takes notice. Because: The
grower sold it at the usual price, half
time and the other Brazilians are
paying morp for their clothe, and
other cotton goods
The only happy men In Brazil, 30
far as cotton is coucerned, aiv the
members of the buyers' combine and
they are sitting tight behind their
four cent wall and saying nothing ex
cept that it is still terrib':- dij in the
northern cotton fields. Last week
I resident Braz directed a memorial to
the governments of all the cotton
states of Brazil, urging them to raise
the export duties on cotton to a pro
hibitive figure. This is the extent
of his power over export duties,
which are regulated by the states in
dividually.
Recently a government measure w.vi
introduced in the federal senate pro
posing to deplete or at lt.-ast reduce,
the duty on imported raw cotton. The
memorial to the states was directed
in the hope of stopping a possible
shortage in the Brazilian markets.
The bill in the senate has for its pur
pose the reduction iu local prices by
means ot outside competition.
Nobody can predict what the cot
ton states will do toward prohibit
ing the exportation of cotton, but it
is safe to predict that the import
duty will be reduced materially and
that is the big hope of the textile
industry, the hope of th-3 American ex
porter and the benefit of all concern
ed except perhaps t!'e Brazilian
grower and the combine. The grower
doesn't worry, except for oratorical
purpose!, because he produces the
lest cotton in the world when the
drought permits him.
