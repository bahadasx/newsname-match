RURAL CREDITS CONFERENCE.
HOUSTON, HOLLIS AND LEVER
SEE PRESIDENT.
Soutli Carolina Congressman Seems
Encouraged at Prospect or Legisla?
tion.
Washington, Jan. 28.?Secretary
Houston, Senator Holl is and Repre?
sentative Lever were today in confer?
ence with the president for more than
an hour discussing various phases of
the joint committee bill on rural
credit? now being considered by the
banking and currency committees of
the house and senate.
It is understood that the conference
was arranged primarily for the pur?
pose of discussing with the president
the amendments which Mr. Lever is
proposing to.the joint committee bill?
amendments*^htch were voted down
in the Joint' committee.
The principal amendment proposes
a form of limited guarantee by the
federal treasury of the bonds which
are to be issued by the land banks
composing the system. Inasmuch as
the market price of the bond fixes
the interest which the farmer pays
upon his mortgage loan, It is extreme?
ly Important, In the view of Mr. Lever,
that the bond should be so strong as
to make it the safest kind of invest?
ment and therefore carry the lowest
rate of Interest which rate of Interest
twill be reflected In a low rate of In?
terest on the farm mortgage.
Mr. Lever declined to be quoted as
to the president's views on this propo?
sition, but it was observed that he was
unusually jovial, notwithstanding the
fact that he has been suffering from
grip for ten days, and it is significant
also that late today he introduced the
joint committee bill witlj his amend?
ments Inserted. Among the friends
of rural credits, this conference Is
looked upon as of very great signif?
icance and may be the turning point
in rural credits legislation.

Lerer Unhesitatingly Supports Presi?
dent's Plan lor Scientific Study of
Subject.
Washington, Jan. 29.?Congressman
Lever today unhesitatingly indorsed
the suggestion of the president for the
formation of a tariff commission.
"I believe the time has come when
revenue laws should be based upon
scientifically ascertained facts, and
while the party has taken varying po?
sitions as to a commission for this
purpose, still I am extreemly glad
that the president is big enough In
this matter, as others, to reverse his
former position when the facts war?
rant it." said Mr. Lever. "The world
Is lacing a situation such as it has
never seen before, and no man has
Vision enough to predict what the
economic situation is going to be when
hostilities cease in Europe. We must ,
be prepared for whatever the condi
tions may be. ami with reference to
revenue legislation, i see no other
agency which can 10 well furnish the
data upon which to act as can a sc- |
leclcd tariff board."
NO PELLAGRA A! ORPHANAGE.
EPWORTH INSTITUTION FREE OF
CASES AT PRESENT.
Public Health Service Expert Finds
upon Inspection Dietary Treatment
Results Very Satisfactory.
Columbia, Jan. 29.?"There is abso?
lutely no evidence of pellagra among
the children," said Joseph Goldberger,
surgeon of the United States public
health service, after an inspection yes?
terday at Epworth orphanage, Colum?
bia.
"The children who had the worst
cases'arc now fine, plump, rosy and
healthy and all evidence of the dis?
ease has disappeared," he added.
The public health service took
charge of the more than 100 cases
of pellagra at the orphanage last Sep?
tember. The dietary treatment was
applied and the children have ap?
parently been cured. However, the
surgeons will keep all of the children
under observation for one year. The
food has been carefully prepared and
an effort has been made to balance
the ration.
Dr. Goldberger came to Columbia
yesterday on one of his regular trips
of inspection. He was accompanied
on the visit to the orphanage by J.
W. Babcock, M. I>., of Columbia, sec?
retary of the National Association for
the Study of Pellagra.
"I am very much pleased with the
results," said Dr., Goldberger.
INQUIRY ON PERSIA CASE.
United States Asks If Dual Monarchy
Denies Sinking?Matter Will be
Considered Closed.
Washington, Jan. 8.?The United
Sttaes has addressed another injuiry
i
to Austria asking if any of its sub?
marine commanders have knowledge
of the destruction of the British liner
Persia. A statement that they had
i
none, reported ta have been handed
to Ambassador Penfield several days
ago, never has been received here.
State department officials consider
I that they virtually have exhausted
every other source of information in
their effort to establish what caused
the amking of the Persia, with, the
loss of two American lives.
Germany has assured the United
States that none of Its submarines
was responsible, and assertions by
survivors that the ship was torpedoed
have not been proved. The state de
partment wants a definite statement
from the Vienna government, and
should a denial be received the case
i
probably will be considered closed.
Only one dispatch has been re?
ceived from Ambassador Penileld re
jgarding the Persia. That came Janu?
ary 7 and stated that the Austrian
foreign office then had no informa?
tion as to the sinking. Charge
Zwiedinek of the Austrian embassy
here has advised Secretary Lansing
that since that his government, so far
as it had heard from Its submarine
j commanders, had no report of such
an attack. *
The second inquiry, officials think,
I should bring a positive statement
from the Austrian government as it
is considered that all of its sub
J marine commanders in tho Mediter?
ranean have had time to report since
the tragedy.
