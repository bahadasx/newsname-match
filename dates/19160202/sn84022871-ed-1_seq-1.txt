Dennis Grondin
The pupils of the sixth and seventh
grades were saddened by the death of
their little friend and playmate, Dennis
Francis Grondin, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
C. F. Grondin. Dennis passed to the
life beyond on Wednesday, Jan. 26,
after a two weeks' illness at the St.
Johnsbury hospital, where he was
taken for an operation for appendicitis.
His age was 15 years, five months and 14
days. Dennis was a very faithful pupil
of our school, he had not been tardy
or absent once this school year, was of
a kind disposition, willing to learn and
much beloved by all his little compan
ions. His funeral was held Saturday
morning at the Catholic church at ten
o'clock. The popils of the sixth and
seventh grades sent flowers and extend
their deepest' sympathy to the grief -stricken
parents. He leaves to mourn
his loss beside his parents one . sister
and three brothers.
Card We wish to extend our heart
felt thanks to the friends and neighbors
who so kindly assisted us during the
sickness, death and burial of our be
loved son and brother.

Hindus, the Russian Next Tuesday.
Morris Gershon Hindus, a native of
Russia, where .he received, his early
education, will appear as the next
number in the Barton lecture course
at Seaver's hall Tuesday evening
Mr. Hindus can tell us something of
extreme interest about that great
northern nation now engaged in the
giant war struggle of Europe. He is
a graduate of one of pur American
universities and before finishing his
course he was filling week-end engage
ments on the lecture platform. After
graduation he was promptly made a
regular member of one of our great
lecture bureaus. Mr. Hindus knows
the joys (what few there are) and the
sorrows of peasant life in that country,
and the tyrannies of church and state,
as only a native can. Coming from
that darkness into the full light of
American liberty, he has made good
use of his opportunities. He uses
English like one to the manner born ;
he is a fine speaker with a clear enun
ciation and a vigorous and impressive
manner; and bis enthusiasm for his
adopted country and her free institu
tions is positively contagious.
Optimists should hear him to confirm
their optimism; pessimists to cure
their pessimism ; young people should
hear him to learn what it really means
to live under the Stars and Stripes;
and men and women of all ages, as
they listen to his earnest words, will
feel the fires of patriotism glow more
brightly in their hearts.

so far taken the snow off that nearly

Today, Candlemas day, is cloudy and
those who believe in signs look forward
to an early spring., It is certain with
as little snow on the ground, that any
ordinary fall now would soon disappear
with the warming suns of February
and March.
Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
A large audience listened to the
morning talk which was upon "Selling
Christ," the text being found in Mat
thew 26:15, "What will ye giv me
and I will give him unto you." A
brief abstract of the sermon, which
closed with a strong appeal against
the selling of the things of real value,
follows: "Men naturally is a bargain
hunter. If he gets cheated once, it
only makes him try harder to get a
bargain next time. Men hunt bar
gains on the sly while women go in
droves. There are some transactions
in which we lose more valuable things
than silver and gold. Self-respect,
manhood, integrity, are often bartered
away. So long as you ' retain your
honor and your faith in God, you are
wonderfully rich. There is nothing
wrong in amassing wealth Evidently
God has given to some capabilities
and a genius for doing so, and if a
man gets his money honestly and uses
it wisely, God will bless him in the
getting and the spending. When Judas
sold Christ he also sold his own soul to
Satan. The thought of . selling .Christ
is abhorrent to us and we say we are
in no danger of doing that? But are
we not? Christ is being sold today in
a spiritual sense but as really as Judas
sold his body so long ago. Jesus Christ
stands for the best things in the worlc
and when we cast aside these anc
choose base and ig-oble things, whai
is it but selling Christ? Many men
have sold him for wealth, the pressure
of business driving him ut of their
lives. Others sell him for pleasure
The person who week after week
absents himself from church and spends
the entire day in pleasure seeking, is
selling Christ. Christianity stands for
unselfishness and the Christian must
be self sacrificing. If your religion
doesn't make you happy you had better
get a different kind."
Remember to be at the church parlor
on Thursday evening at 7.30 o'clock.
The Sunday evening talk was princi

eras himself, that is self gov

than self government that is 1
P3 despotism. !
Pa This government cannot en- '
PS dure permanently half slave
P5 and half free.
Pa I have always thought that
Pa all men should be free, but if
Pa any should be slaves it should
Pa be, first, those who desire it
Pa for themselves and, secondly,
Pa those who desire it for others.
Pa Let us have faith that right

Sa let us dare to do our duty as
Pa we understand it.
Pa Public sentiment is every
Sa thing. With public sentiment
PS nothing can fail; without it
Pa nothing can succeed. Conso
le quently he who molds public
Pa sentiment goes deeper than
Pa he who enacts statutes or pro
Pa nounces decisions. He makes
Pa statutes and decisions possi

A TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN.
General Gobin Spoke on "Lincoln From
a Soldier's Viewpoint."
, At a Lincoln birthday meeting in
Philadelphia General John P. S. Go
bin, the famous Pennsylvania soldier,
told of the great veneration which the
soldiers in the Union army felt for the
president and the inspiration their
chief executive was to them on the
field of battle.
General Gobin said In part:
"Lincoln's personality reveals every
attribute of the highest type of Ameri
can manhood.
"His state papers are read with in
terest and reverence as we learn the
circumstances which produced them.
Colonel Ingersoll, in his estimate of
Lincoln, epitomized his character . as
the grandest figure of the fiercest civil
war waged In history.
"Thus he stands before lis today as
a soldier, citizen and statesman,, real
izing the responsibility imposed upon
him aa. equal to if not creator Ujan

TRAINING CLASS NOTES
The training class is developing
some carpenters. Come in and see
what they have done.
The books for outside reading were
exchanged last week. . This work is
proving very interesting.
Seen on the board in room 18, "If
possible bring scissors, tape needles
and coarse crochet needles this after
noon. ' I wonder what they are going
to do now.
If you happened to listen you would
hear the girls of the training class
singing little songs at all hours.
Also you perhaps would hear mi-sol-io-mi-re-do-la
and so on.
THE OLDER BOYS' CONFERENCE
On Wednesday afternoon of last week
Lee Emerson '17, gave before the
members of the high school an excel
lent report of the sixth annual Confer
ence of the Older Boys of tbe Green
Mountain State. Emerson was sent by
the boys of Barton academy as a dele
gate to this conference which was held
at Rutland. The conference opened
Friday night, Jan. 14, with a big
banquet which was served in the
Shrine theatre and which was attended
by over 4000 boys from all parts of
Vermont. The conference closed with
a special service in the Congregational
church Sunday evening, Jan. 16. Em
erson's report covered his trip from
the time he left Barton for Rutland on
the 7 o'clock train Friday morning
until he reached Barton the following
Monday. His report of the many
meetings of the convention, together
with the report of the various speeches
heard at the meetings, was especially
interesting. The annual conference of
the Older . Boy is doing wonderful
work toward developing the future
manhood of the boy of Vermont and it
is hoped that Barton academy will be
represented at these conferences every
year. Rawson Calkins, '17, who at
tended the conference, going as a dele
gate from the Sunday school of the
Congregational church, also told on
Wednesday afternoon his sentiments
about the conference. Boys of Barton.
these conferences are deserving of
your thought and attention.

Smelting In Bulacan.
A primitive iron smelting industry,
evidently of Chinese origin, exists in
Bulacan, a province of the island ol
Luzon. Magnetite and hematite ores,
found in the locality, are smelted , bj
the natives in small bamboo cased
blast furnaces of soft clay bricks sel
in clay, each furnace being seven and
one-half feet hih and five feet in ex
ternal diameter, with a conical innei
cavity, tapering from forty to twenty
inches. The furnace .has a single da j
tuyere and a Chinese double acting
hand blower made from a hollow tree
trunk and fitted with a feather packed
wooden piston. .An average charge is
fifty-five pounds of ore and ninety-five
of charcoal, no flux, being used. The
Iron made is cast directly into molds
for plowshares and plow points, and
the product of a furnace is about 500,
pounds of castings daily.
The Chiefs Error.
Goron was chief of the Paris police
when the following incident took place:
Lombroso had written tt book in 1888
on criminality among women, so runs
the story, and, when it was finished
wrote to Goron to send him "forth
with" some portraits of Parisian wom
en criminals. Anxious to please the
writer, the package was made up and
started on its tour to Italy. When
the book came out Lombroso sent a
copy, handsomely bound, to Goron,
who saw his gift acknowledged on the
first page. "It was a scholarly book,"
Bald the chief, "and would have had a
large sale but for an error on my part.
The pictures came out of the wrong
drawer of my desk. They were not
criminals at all, but women who had
applied for hucksters licenses, and a
new edition had to be printed to make
good a police mistake.
