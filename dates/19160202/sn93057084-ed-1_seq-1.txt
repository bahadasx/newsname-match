"PREPAREDNESS"—BUT
A copy of the New Bedford
(Conn.) Sunday Standard of Jan.
16th finds its way to our exchange
table, and from its appearance we
judire it to he a daily of wide cir
cululion and influence. We are
much pleased with its position on
river and harbor legislation,
which is given as follows in an
editorial:
The Press has never had much
to say about the meritorius acts
or otherwise of South Dakota's
congressmen. One reason for this
is that we have not, and will not,
knowingly endorse this "pork bar
rell" system of river and harbor
improvements..
The Press is in receipt of a copy
of the American Prohibition Year
Book for 1916, a work of 207
pages, published by the National
Prohibition Committee of Chicago
Illinois, 106 N. LaSalle-st, and is
to had for the low price of 2oc.
Everyone interested in the success
of the "dry" campaign in South
Dakota should have one, as it is
truly an "Encyclopedia pertaining
to the Liquor Traffic." We have
an extra copy of the book on hand
which we can sell to any of our
home readers desiring one.
A report was in circulation here
this week—started by one of the
raost prominent residents of Sully
county, who comes to Forest City
frequently^-that there was a move
on foot for the Milwaukee Ry Co
to build a direct line from Mo
bridge to Chamberlain. Well—
I
Just as in cities, alder­
men are expected to get things for
their wards, so in the nation con
gressmen are expected to get
things for their districts and so
long as that theory is honored,
waterway improvements are bound
to be wasteful and poorly pland.
The nation's funds for this pur
pose should be expended according
to a national plan, from a national,
instead of a district, point of view.
"Cost what the}' may, properly
pland river and harbor improve
ments are worth while. They are
part of any well-conceived, com
prehensive plan of (war)4prepared
ness.' The present hit-or-miss
method of each congressmen for
himself is, on the other hand,
wasteful and ineffectual, and to
perpetrate it at the expense of the
army and navy would be a double
calamity."

We fancy that only a few peo
ple realize that the extensive coal
fields mentioned in the following
paragraph from the Bison (Per
kins-co) Courier, come within six
tv to seyentv miles of Forest City.
"These cold days when we are
kept busy shoveling coal we can
not help but be thankful for the
abundance of good coal that un
derlies all this section of the coun
try. The coal we are getting
from the local mines seems to be
getting better each j-ear as the
veins ave worked deeper into the
banks. At the Sexton mine the
vein has thickened to over six feet
so that each yard square makes
something over two double box
loads. He has uncovered a quar
ter of an acre this fall and still has
about 34 acres of coal to work.
Mr Sexton reports the sale of
nearl\T 700 double box loads this
winter. Other mines in the coun
try are being opened to supply
local needs, but the mines at
Haynes, the one at Lodgepole,
and the Rogers and Sexton mines
south of here are the largest in
this section."
rumors like these area great balm
to our feelings when our mails.
"patents" etc get to coining in
twentyfour hours and over late.
Ail we need is enough of such ru
mors, to make theC&XW "sit up
and take notice/'
A recent issue of the Mobridge
Bulletin contains a picture of the
big Congregational church of that
place, with its parsonage and Sun
davschool classes, and her citizens
are certainly to be congratulated.
The Sundayschool has ^n enroll
ment of 17o. We cannot apply
the moral to Forest City better
than in the language of the Bulle
tin, as follows:
"Whatever it costs to maintain
a church in our city is money well
spent when one realizes the throng
of young folks that are brought
within its influence and helped
into a better manhood and woman
hood. The plant that is shown
(above) is a worthy tribute, to the
men and women of Mobridge who
have so freely contributed to
establish it here. And the call is
loud to the rest of our people to
find their place and do their part
to make the United Church (Con
gregational) and Sunday School
what thev ought to be."
The Immigration Department of
South Dakata has asked the Coun
ty Advisers, the seed dealers and
those whom it is thought are in a
position to know as to the seed
corn for 1916 and the reports indi
cate that there is more than will
be needed for So. Dakota, except
perhaps the earliest varieties, and
particularl}' in the northern part
of the state. But before any is
shipt out of a neighborhood, the
local demand should be supplied,
and farmers who must buy should
be urged to purchase while they
can. The Department has 150,000
bushels listed since the first of
January and will be pleased to
give the list to anyone needing
seed corn. Chas. McCaffrce
