The suit of R L. Faulkner against
T. B. Dowell, the action being
brought for the possession of a calf,
was settled last Wednesday night at
7:45 by a jury rendering a verdict in
favor of Faulkner.
The case had been in court since 1913,
and cost amounting to about seven
hundred dollars had accumulated.
The calf was valued at thirty dollars.
The case was first tried before
Judge Herriford, who rendered a de
cision in favor of Faulkner. Dowell
appealed and the first trial in the cir
cuit court, the jury disagreed. At
the October term, 1914, Faulkner had
the case continued on account of absent
witnesses.
Last Monday it was again called,
both sides answering ready, the fight
commenced and it was a contest from
start to finish, Faulkner being repre
sented by Gordon Montgomery and W.
M. Jackson, the defense by J. F.
Montgomery, Jones & Garnett and
L. C. Winfrey.
There were twenty-five or thirty
witnesses to the side, and the jury did
not get the case until Wednesday
night, rendering a verdict in favor of
Faulkner in thirty minutes after go
ing to its room.
The case was argued for the defense
by J. R. Garnett and L. C. Winfrey;
for the plaintiff, by W. M. Jacuson
and Gordon Montgomery.
The controversy was brought about
this way: In 1913, Mr. Faulkner and
Mr. Dowell had cattle running in ad
joining fields and they got mixed, and
when separated Mr. Dowell, as Mr.
Faulkner claimed, got one -of his
calves. Dowell claimed that no mis
take had been made and that the calf
in controversy was his, hence the suit
which has been settled. The money
expended on both sides would have
bought a drove of cattle.
As above stated the cost will amount
to about seven hundred dollars, Mr
Faulkner paying aboun $150, the cost
that accumulated at the October term
when he had the case continued. The
remainder of the seven hundred will
have to be paid by Mr. Dowell.
Cumberland College Basket Ball
team will play the High School team,
this place, this, (Wednesday) evening,
the game to be called a few minutes,
after 7 o'clock. Come out every body.
It will be remembered that some
time last fall that ,LucienJBell, who
was at work for the Cumberland
Grocery Company, andjwho was mak-
ing some stores in the county, got into
Pettitsfork when the stream was past
fording and the horse he was driving
got drowned, and also -the buggy torn
to pieces. The horse apd vehicle be
longed to W. H. Wilson & Co., livery
men. A suit was brought by the
owners of the horse and buggy, to re
cover from the grocery company the
value of same. It was tried out last
week, and the jury rendered a verdict
of ninety-three dollars against the de
fendants. The mails were very irregular for
the first two weeks of January. The
roads were very bad and the waters
were high, hence all mails leaving
Columbia, except on the Campbells
ville route, were very uncertain of
their destination. This is a great an
noyance. Build roads and bridges is
the watch word.
Mr. Charles Walls, who is a travel
ing salesman, and who has made his
home in Columbia for the past five
years, has removed, with his family,
to Lebanon. He is very congenial
and has an interesting family, consist
ing of his wife, five daughters and one
.son. They have the beat wishes of
this community.
Mr. Carl Ballou lost a good horse
one day last week, appearently from
heart failure. He was en route to
Cumberland river and was leading his
horse when ic dropped to the ground
and died in a few minutes
W. C. Van Hoy bought a saddle
horse from Ed Van Hoy for 8125. He
sJso bought a four year old fancy driv
ing mare from W. J. Conover for $185.
A little daughter, three years old, of
Mr. and Mrs. Ethrldge Bennett, died

It cbsts'k country newspaper money
everyftlrae it takes a stand on any
question says the shelbyville 'Record.
Almost any citizen besides a news
paper man can do it without injuring
his business. If the editor advocates
improvements the sore heads go after
him and sometimes stop their paper.
If he opposes improvements, the pro
gressive sort get on him and call him
a back" number and a knocker. If he
publishes politics, the opposition gets
into'his hair and if he does not, he is
charged with being afraid to stand
out for his opinion. If he condemns
mail order houses, there are some peo
ple who ask him to attend to his own
business, as they have a right to trade
where they please. If he publishes a
mail-order ad some of the merchants
are after his gore. No country paper
can come out squarely without mak
ing enemies and losing money, and in
a run or a year or more will incur some
criticism from everybody. The news
paper that undertakes to please ev
erybody will please nobody. If it is
honest and sincere and thoughtful,
the public will respect it.

immediately picked up a trail behind
the burnea building. Over a hundred
spectators, mounted and on foot fol
lowed the baying blood hound as he
followed with perfect ease a trail 24
hours old for 2 miles to a man's home
and then to his barn. The flog then
gave up the hunt. No accusations
have been reported as to the results,
but the parties who followed the an
imals' trail made up a nice purse and
seemed satisfied with the result.

The Fiscal Court of Green county
was to have met last Saturday to take
steps to compromise the bonded rail
road debt The county has an offer
of-25 cents on the dollar, and a dis
patch from Greensburg has this to say
concerning the proposition:
The judgment holders who own the
railroad bonds have agreed to accept
a compromise of 25 cents in full set
tlement of their bonds. This would
levy a tax of something over 7 on
each 3100 worth of taxable property
in Green county. While a large per
cent of the taxpayers are in favor of
the compromise on those conditions,
a number ttiink the compromise too
large, as the bonds were sold several
years ago for from 5 to 10 cents on
the dollar A great many are bitterly
opposed to paying any part of this
debt
Green county has lived under the
burden of this debt for forty-odd
years and many think a reasonable
compromise would be for the better
interest of the county.
A compromise has been talked of
for years, but a proposition has never
before been made by the bondholders.
The question will be put to a vote of
the county if the Fiscal Court accepts
the offer of the bondholders.
