"Not one-hair of the regulars ' or

"We have no defense. We art tin
prepared. The only way to net it le
toy the universal military training
system. We muat get It now and get
It quickly."
.' I Wood lilt off his sentences with a
ringing crlspneas. He referred to the
(alfim-iits of former Secretary of the
Interior Fisher, who suggested a plan
for 'Vlvh training with a military
feature as a bl-prodwt," as "a play
on words."
Washington. Der. IX. Major (ien
eral Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff or
the army, today ripped the lid off the
"pot 6f opinion which army staff and
line men have brewed over the border
duty service of the national guard.
Scott also voiced the army men's
verdict on the system of national de
fense now In vogue In this country.
Going Into some of Vie secret work
ings of the army war college plnn
for adequate defense, Scott told the
lib-committee of the Chamberlain
senate military committee, that where
It once believed 500,000 men, to he

ties in which this nation engaged,
would be sufficient "as a starter,"
lessons learned from the European
war. led staff officials to decide this
Initial force should not bo less than
1,500,000 equipped, seaaoned, per
fectly trained trooa.
"The general staff at' the outset
of the European war," Scott said,
"gave as Its opinion thut our system
should be able to furnish 500,000
fully trained and organised mobile
troops nt tho outbreak of a war and
to have at least 500,0(10 more avail
able within 00 days.
' "In Its report the general .staff
pointed out that two hostile expedi
tions alone would provide a force
large enought to cope with our one
million mobile troops and that we
must, at the outset, provide a sys
tem to raise and train, In addition,
five hundred thousand 'troops to re
pines the losses and wastage In per
sonnel incident to the war.
"However, In view or the change
that have taken place since the out
break of the European war, the ques
tion has been r-atudled. We all
agree that our system should now be
able to furnish In round numbers
1,500,000 trained and organised
troops at the outset and 1,500,000
additional within SO days.
"This la partly due to (ha fact (hat

Scott emphasised that the navy of
this power England controls the
sea absolutely, and that Its merchant
marine la lufllolent "to transport
without delay over 1,000,000 soldiers
with necessary equipment." -
"Due to the fact that our northern
neighbor la an Island empire, a great

The temper of the British people
toward peace was Indicated when a
huge mob yesterday attacked Sylvia

group or her aympathlsera.
Miss Pankhurat attempted to hold
a "demonstration" at the Bst India

rrom their fet. Police Interrerence
put an end to the dmonstrstton, but
a Jeering crowd followed the woman
to police headquarters, where the
prisoners were held under ball for
examination by a magistrate.
It Is expected Lloyd-George will

SUPPLY OF FOOD
London, Doc. 18. Food control
went Into effect throughout England
today. Regulations curtailing meats,
which tiecame effective today, were
met by the British people with a
sort or schoolboy good humor, en
tirely tolerant and -ungrudgingly.
"I ate too much anyway; the rood
control will help me reduce." ,
This expression Indicated general
sentiment oa the new, regulations be
camo operative. A rew lovers of food
have devised "trick menus," which
circumvent the purpose of the food
curtailment, but compliance with the
new rulings is more general.
Questions galore have been raised
by the regulations and their opera
tions. One or the problems which
faced the Londoner at dinner, was
whether two helpings from one course
constituted two courses, for the num
ber of courses Is limited by the law.
our northern neighbor Is In close al
liance with a powerful oriental na
tionanother Island empire and,
for the same reason, when acting In
alliance with a power which has con
trol or the sea, has ability to send
Its army or 1,150,000 fighting men to
any part or the world without danger.
"I think a mere statement of these
raets makes It clear that we are prac
tically defenseless before the veteran
armies of our northern neighbors
and could easily be crushed by the
existing coalition of England and
Japan."
In discussing the national guard
and the national guard system, Scott
emphasised the distinction between
the Individuals composing the" per
sonnel and tha mllltla system and a

RESTORATlOii OF
CELG1U11 OUST
CQOTTII PEACE
Washington, Dee. 18. United
States officials are convinced today
there can be no formal discussion of
peaca nntll Germany and Austria
avow their willingness to restore Bel
glum and Serbia, and until all na
tions involved are ready to disarm
oa a rather large scale.
. In hla forthcoming speech, Prem
ier Lioyd-Oeorg of England, la ex
pected to insist on such terms and a
fundamental groundwork for any
formal parleya and such action oa
hla part would serve to "pass the
buck" back to Germany.
Moreover officials believe he will
cuiMne fully What the allies are fight
ing for, hut In no circumstances will
ha voice a scornful or flat rejection
of the Oerman offers. ,
' The United Press is In a position
today to give a dttalled outline of
his government's convictions on the
several angles of peace developments.
They are: ' "
; It Is believed Germany offered
peace because her people were be
coming restive; It la believed the
people of all countries want peace
America Included ao long as there
ia no sacrifice of tha principles for
which tha fighting haa been going
o- . ' ..' ' . - -'.
This government la convinced there
can toe no formal discussion of peace
unless suck discussion carries .as
avowed willingness of Germany and
Austria to restore France, Belgium
and Serbia. ; ,; -,
- There can he no peaca without as
surances of disarmament on a large
scale tnr all countries wttk some plan
for alliance of nations to prevent
future ware. "
' No reason Is seen why Lloyd-
George, when be addresses tha com
mons ahould fail to outline the gen
eral peaa terms of tha allies.
Unequivocal rejection of the Oer
man proffer would Immediately react
to England'e disadvantage in neutral
countries. It Is believed.
It would also result In embittering
tha Oerman people to the point where
they would unite even mora solidly
than ever behind tha government, the
fcm of which England desires to des
troy.
' Tha German people would then be
convinced the allied war on them
waa one against their existence, and
would fight to tha death.
As a result of these convictions,
this government believes Lloyd
George may say what-England and
her allies regard as necessary v to
make peace possible. Should he do
this, the belief Is strong that Ger
many night be 'forced toy her own
people to acquiesce to such terms as
do not threaten her existence.
On the other hand, should the Brit
ish premier stand by his recent dec
laration, that the war must go on
"to a knockout," little hope of peace
Is aeen and every posstbllty of grave
danger to hla country's friendly re
lations with the Teutonic powers.
