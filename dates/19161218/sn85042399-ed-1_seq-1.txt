without a head. L. O. Van Wegen
was acting as driver, having taken
the place of Glen Gulley, who had left
the day before. By the time an or
ganized attempt was made fo get at
the fire It had broken through Into
the two-foot space between the, ceil

the fire, which kept breaking out in
new .places through the roof and
which, because of the tar roofing, was
extremely difficult to subdue, break
ing out as soon as the water was
shifted to a new place. For the first
hour one stream was thrown through
the windows to keep the fire from
breaking down into the top story, and J
one stream was thrown from a build
ing at the rear. A third stream was
thrown from the street to the roof
until Ray Sayles conceived the Idea i
of making a water tower out of a
telegraph pole.
Effective Work.
Climbing the pole, Sayles hauled
the hose up after him and tied it se
curely fast at the nozzle. With the
assistance of A. L. Strickland this im
provised tower did fine service as the
nozzle was about twelve feet directly
above the roof and could be swung
.to play at will over the roof. Line
men Murphy and Jordan did yeoman
service also on the pole, relieving the
first pair at intervals of aa hour
when the cold became Intense.
A fourth hose was hauled to the
top of the Odd Fellows building and
thrown down onto the roof of the
water thrown down onto the roof of
the burning building.
Three Hours. '
For three hours water was poured
In a river from the four streamB
into and onto the building, but the
stubborn flames persisted, and finally
were subdued only when the roof had
fallen In. No damage was done to
the floor of the second story and tha
lathing on the walls was injured only
In a few places. A new roof and
ceiling will be needed and new plas

Applemen To Meet
Next Year at Salem
The conference of apple growers
which was held at Hood River closed
Tuesday, after a very Interesting
meeting. The next session will be
held at Salem in 1917. Many inter-
esting aftd valuable papers on thejeharni
care, production and sale 'of this
Porunt crop were given. It was def-
a8cei.talned that high grading
of apples pald, and that culls should
be sold for at least 50 cents a box,
otherwise it would be. more profit
jable to dispose of them to by-prod-iuct8
plants at $6 per, ton. It was
also recommended that shippers con-
jfine themselves to two grades instead
of three, these to be extra fancy and
standard.
Mrs. S. C. Hamaker has returned
to Ashland after vsiting her friend,
Mrs. Eva Morton, of Phoenix. She
expects to leave soon for her home at
Bly, Ore.
dom met with in Ashland was the Ice
Which formed on the fighters, hose,
i roofs and walks and made the work
not only disagreeable but dangerous.
Granite street and Main street near
the building soon were covered with
a coating of ice from the water. Hot
coffee was served along toward mid
night to the firemen.
Boys Help Most.
High school boys did the largest
part of the work, there being about
one man and five boys at each noz
zle. The lads stuck to the chilly toil
like heroes even after some of the
men workers had begun to seek a
place to warm up.
A large crowd collected and a few
willing spirits aided in getting out
the bakery supplies and furniture
from the lower floors. A number of
small boys helped get out the dough
nuts from the bakery.
Will Rebuild,
Mrs. Alen will rebuild Immediately
and all her tenants except the bakery
have promised to stay with her. The
bakery will move Into the Odd Fel
lows building. The gas office Is occu
pying temporary quarters In the room
formerly occupied by Crowson's In
the Elks Temple. Tnsurance adjust
ers are working on the loss figures
and Mrs. Allen has hopes that the
loss to the building will be covered,
although the furniture loss, is Irretrievable.
State Now Has
Thirty-Six Counties
Oregon's thirty-sixth county came
into existence last week when Gov
ernor Withycombo proclaimed the re
sult of a vote on a measure consti
tuting Deschutes county out of a por
tion of Crook county. The measure
decreeing the change was adopted by
the voters of the area affected at the
November election. Bend will be the
county Beat of Deschutes county.
Claim Existence
Of Booze Auto Line
Newspapers of the Willamette val
ley are making much "copy" out of
j the alleged existence of a regular line
of booze-carrying automobiles which
are said to be running between Horn
brook and northern points.
While no doubt a few cars have
made the trip in the past month, they
have been very few, and It is very
doubtful. In the opinion of those fa

Holmes' Grocery
Is One Big Bower
The chance visitor to Holmes' gro
cery hardly can conceive that he is
i in such a mundane establishment
j as a grocery when he ' enters the
I bower of Christmassy beauty Into
I which H. P. Holmes and his helpers
I have transferred that store. Of
course a large part of the beauty lies
in the fact that the biggest stock
of beautiful china and glassware in
this part of the country If not In
southern Oregon is displayed therein,
but the manner of display Is Its chief
A bower of everygreens holds
im-ithe center of the display space, while
a series of evergreen arches with the
gift dishes displayed. In serried rows
I beneath make a wonderful effect.
This is one of the Christmas shopping
attractions which the gift buyer and
the admirer of beautiful displays can
not afford to paBS by.
Discuss Southern
Oregon Problems
The southern Oregon representa
tives of the state legislature which
will convene next month, with the
exception of two who were unable to
be present, met at Grants Pass Mon
day and freely discussed the prob
lems of general interest to the wel
fare of southern Oregon, and where
agreement was possible, outlined
plans of campaign to be carried on.
The gathering was a very profitable
one and will doubtless set a prece
dent which will mean a like gather
ing previous to every session of the
legislature in the future.
A very heated argument arose in
regard to the question of closing the
Rogue river for commercial fishing
purposes, the Medford and Grants
Pass residents differing to a great
extent on the subject.
In the evening the representatives
were entertained by the Grants PasB
Commercial Club. Dean Cordley of
the Oregon Agricultural College, Mr.
Reimer of the Southern Oregon Ex
periment Station, and Dean Parks of
the school fo mines at the state uni
versity all delivered short talks.
Those present at the conference
were Ben Sheldon and C. M. Thomas
of Medford; W. H. Gore, Joint repre
sentative for Douglas and Jackson
counties; Dr. Sweeney and Senator
Smith of Grants Pass, and C. A.
Brand of Roseburg.
A total of 1,1 5 4,3 8 5 head of sheep,
cattle, horses and hogs were grazed
under permit on the national forest
ranges of Oregon and Washington
during 191 S.
Council Meet
Will Be Brief
The city council will meet tomor
row evening in the recorder's office,
the change from the council chamber
being nerossitated by the fact that
the judges of election will be busy
counting votes in that polling place.
The council meet will be brief. Only
that business which demands lrame-j
diate audition will be cared for and I
an early adjournment is planned.
Van Wegen Resigns
Superintendent Job
' L. O. Van Wegen has given up his
position of superintendent of the min
eral water plants and system and Is
now holding down the Job of driver
J In the fire department. The superin
tendent job paid $90 a month and
Mr. Van Wegen furnished his own
car, gasoline and oil for the round of
pumps which was required dally. A
good full day was also required for
the work to be done, besides a me
chanic's knowledge of pumps, electric
motors :ind apparatus, plumbing and
the intricate machinery of the pump
ing plant and central station. Super
vision of the pipe lines also came un
der his care. Dm ing the summer Mr. I
Van Wegen found that he could just
about make fair wages above the cost j
of car upkeep, and when winter came
he figured out that the fire depart-1
ment jo1) would net him considerably
more. There are few car owners In
Ashland who would allow their car
' to make the trip to the pumps in win-
ter weather for three dollars, say
i nothing hout their own time.
Frank Crowson is holding down the Vedlord last Saturday. Dr. E. (i. mineral wnters ho passed, as at pres

Men's Windows
i Compel Attention
If you are looking for a gift for
a nia.n- -)nd few exist who haven't at
least one man on their gift list it
will be worth your while to pause in
your mad glftward rush, in front of
the show windows of Mitchell &
Whittle, who claim distinction of be
ing a "men only" store. Those two
windows have a display oi men's fur
nishings which have made covetous
more than one young fellow. And the
display is most artistic as well. Ash
land merchants are fast learning the
value of an artistic show window
which compels the- attention of the
passerby, and Mitchell & Whittle have
surely achieved such a window. To
name over the great variety of up-to-the
minute men's furnishings in the
display would require much space.
Take a look yourself.
Vice Testimony
Was Play Basis
Adding to the many great recom
mendations which have been given
"The Little Girl Next Door," the
manager of tho film production Btates
that a prominent Klamath Falls min
ister gave the picture one of the best
yet and 'hat great crowds saw it and
profited by it in that city. The play
is a drama based on the findings of
the vice investigation committee at
Chicago, and has an interesting story
with a straight look into the pitfalls
before the girls and women of the
country.
The picture will be shown at the
Vlnlng this evening and matinee and
evening tomorrow.
Some of the scenes, it is said, rival
the most lurid melo-drama as thrill
ers, and yet the directors of the pro
duction are said to have followed the
facts as faithfully as exhibition pur
poses would permit. Some of the
scenes are laid in the same notorious
resorts and dives in which the wit
nesses testified the Incidents hap
pened.
Kennet Copper
Miners Get Raise
Eleven hundred employes of the
Mammoth Copper Company at Ken
nett were given a voluntary advance
of 25 cents a day In wages. It came

better.

The dentists joined in a luucheon at

White House Has

The While Home grocery has a
fireplace which, while It does not
clve out .in overly amount of heat,
has every other earmark of a real,
honest-to-goodness fireplace. It i8
constructed against a great bank of
evergreen built almost the width of
the interior of tho store and extend
ing to tho ceiling. The" green is
flecked with cotton snow. Colored
lights are hidden in the greenery and
a cleverly conceived fire obtained by
electric means burns in tho fireplace.
Around the flrculace are stacked
great quantities of fruit, candles,
nuts and other essentials of the
nirMnms season for which the
White Houso grocery is a shopping
Mecca.
State Tax Levy
To Be 3.03
The state tax levy will be 3.03
mills. It will raise $2,699,250. The
amount was arrived at by taking the
last year's levy amount, adding 6 per
cent and leaving It to the legislature
to keep within the amount allowed.
