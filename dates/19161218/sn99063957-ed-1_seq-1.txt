OUTLINE TERMS AS
BASIS 1 PEACE
Unequovical Rejection of Of
fer Would Offend Neutral
Nations
WOULD FORCE GERMANY
TO RUTHLESS MEASURES
Might Lead to Trouble Be
tween This Country and
Germany
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 18. United Static
officials are convinced today there can
be no formal discussion of peace until
Germany and Austria avcjjv their wil
lingness to restore Belgium and Serbia
and until all nations involved are ready
to disarm on a rather large scale.
In nig forthcoming speech Premier
Lloyd-George of England is expected to
insist on such terms and a fundamental
ground work for any formal parleys and
such action on his part would serve to
"pass the buck" back to Germany.
Moreover, officials Relieve he will
! outline fully what the allies arc fighting
!for, but in no circumstances will he
voice a scornful or flat rejection of the
. German offers
The United Press is in a position to
day to give a detailed outline of his
I h",',""":'1'' B -" nuua uu mt k-h-..
nngles of peace developments
They aro: It is believed Germany
offered peace because her people were
becoming restive.
It is believed the people of all coun
tries want peace America included so
long as there is no sacrifice of the prin
ciples for which the fighting has been
going on.
This government is convinced there
can bo no formal discussion of peace
unless such discussion carries an avowed
willingness of Germany and Austria to
restore Belgium and Serbia.
Would Unite Germany.
There can be no pence without assur
ances of disarmament on a large scale
in all countries with some plan for al
liance of nations to prevent future wars.
No reason is seen why Lloyd-lleorge,
when he addresses the commons should
fail to outline the general pouce terms
of the allies.
Unequivocal rejection of the Teutonic
proffer would immediately react to Kng
land 's disadvantage in neutral coun
tries, it is believed.
It would also result in embittering
the German people to the point where
they would unite more solidly thnn ever
behind government the form of which
England desires to destroy. The Ger
man people would then lie convinced
(heir's was a war for existence nnd
would urge its ruthless and unrestricted
pursuit.
As a result of these convictions, this
government believes Lloyd-George may
say what England and her allies regard

On the other hand should the British
premier stand by h'm lucent declaration
that the war must go on "to a gnock
out," little hope of peace is keen and
every possibility of. grave danger to this
country's friendly reltaions with the
Teutonic powers.

with the new rulings was gen

their operations. One of the
problems which faced the Lon

Business Men Lined Up On
Wet Side--Billy Sunday
Takes Part
Boston, Mass., Dee. 18. The most

Hilly Sunday, field general for the

Over 9,000, led by ex-Governor Fosst
