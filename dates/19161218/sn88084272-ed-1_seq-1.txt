Meet at Philadelphia to
Hear Carranza's Comment
On Protocol Draft.
By ASSOCIATED PRESS.
Philadelphia. Pa., Dec. IS. Continu
ation of the efforts of the Mexican
American Joint commission to effect a
satisfactory agreement on questions af
fecting the international relations de
pended largely on the result of its
session today, which was called for
the purpose of hearing Gen. Carranza's
decision regarding the protocol signed
at Atlantic City, and sent to him for
ratification. Albert J. Pani, one of the
Mexican commissioners carried the
document to Mexico and returned with
a report which has been designated by
the Mexican representatives as the
"comment of the Mexican executive."
It was indicated that a refusal by
Carranza to ratify the agreement
reached after three months of discus
sion, would offer no alternative other
than the dissolution of the commission,
but that if the report presented by the
Mexicans indicated his desire to discuss
only minor alterations, the conference
might be resumed for a brief period.
The Americans intimated, however,
that long discussion of subjects already
covered in the agreement signed would
not he tolerated and that radical
change especially any demand for the
immediate withdrawal of American
troops from Chihuahua, would not be
granted.
Carranza Int Closing Door.
Indications at the close of the morn
ing session of the Mexican-American
commission were that Gen. Carranza
was not disposed to close the door
against an agreement. Alberto J. Pani

It was understood hat Mr. Pani s
message was not signed by Carranza.
but it was in the form of a communica
tion from the Mexican commission, au
thorized by the Mexican executive.
Counter Declnrntlon of Poller.
To the terms of the protocol provid
ing for the withdrawal of the American
troops within 40 days, it is believed
Carranza offered no insuperable objec-
tioa.
It is known that the declaration of i
secretary Lane that the American gov
eminent reserved the right of unrc-

ities of Carranza and members of his of- .

than a counter declaration of the policy .

Campbell's Motion to Quash
Proceedings Sustained;
Hunt Appeals.
Phoenix. Ariz.. Dec. IS. Superior
judge Standford this morning sustained
governor-elect Thomas Campbell's mo
tion to quash the contest proceedings
Inaugurated by Gov. Hunt. The court I
held that because the secretary of
state has never issued a certificate of
election to Campbell, the court has no
official knowledge of the result of the
election and is therefore without
Jurisdiction.
Gov. Hunt immediately took an ap
peal to the supreme court and it is
expected that the matter will be taken
up there tomorrow by stipulation. In
the meantime the ballot inspection is
suspended.
Unless a decision is reached before 1
January 1 or a court order is secured,
it is probable that both governor-elect
Campbell and Gov. Hunt will claim
possession of the office. On the face
of the certified returns, Campbell is
elected by a plurality of SO votes. The
governor alleges that enough improper
ballots were counted for Campbell to
insure Hunt's reelection, if they are
thrown out.

Army of Ferdinand Finds
Safe Eetreat; Is Being
Eeoutfitted For War.
Paris. France. Dec. IS. The Ru
manian army is now safe, according to
rews received in Paris Sunday night,
says the Petit Parisien. The paper says
that the survivors are now beyond the
Sereth river at Hassay and in Bessa
rabia, where they are being regrouped
and refitted in view of further opera
tions. The entire Rumanian front Is
now stated to be held by the Russians
clone.
After the Bucharest-Pioechtl line was
lost, the story says, the Russians sent
divisions and forces of cavalry to sup
port the retreat of the Rumanian army.
King Ferdinand fell back as rapidly as
possible, assured of the possibility of
reforming behind the shelter of the
Russians and continued the withdrawal
without halting until the Sereth was
crossed.
The Russians offered strong resist
ance to the Germans In the region of
Buzeu so as to permit engineers to
construct a defensive front between
Rlmnik Sarat and the Danube marshes
oil which front, it is stated, the Rus
sians intend to stop the advance of the
Invaders.
