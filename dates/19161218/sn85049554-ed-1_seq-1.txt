"A factof which in the- iiaot played

if a coalition of the ^reat powers aa

invaded by, very large forces within
one month after the declaration of war.
While a war waged Against us by an

A conference- will be held at The

The Frankfurter Zeitung, in another
article on the peace proposals, says: i..
"Germany must try to prevent th«

We expect a wide cleavage of views at

great apparent divergencies of opinioii"

London? Dec." 18.—The first food re

day. Hotels and restaurants are now
forbidden to serve more than two
courses for breakfast or luncheon and
three courses for dinner.
Litttfe Inconvenience was experienced
in the first two meals. The English
man's usual breakfast consists of a ce
real and bacon, eggs or fish, and except
in the more expensive places a lunJl
eon of two courses Is the rule. It was
in arranging for a dinner of three
courses that the caterers experienced
•tie greatest difficulties, but even in
this, case few are likely to go hungry,
as hors d' oeuvres and soup count only
half a course and fof the two other
courses diners have their choice of
fish, er.trcco
Or
roasts, with vegetables
and desserts. Cheese with bread and
butter, or crackers Is ^not counted as a
rourse.
The meatless day. which is expeted

Messages were sent today to large
publishers to ascertain If they will sub-^
scribe to this plan, relinquishing 5 per
cent of the 1917 contracted supply, and
to small publishers to learn their 1917
