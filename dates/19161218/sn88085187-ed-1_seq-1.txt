Why Married Women Work
Mayor Fnwcett opened a wide
field for ill- •■';■;:.i':ii when he made
public a letter from "Six Working
Girls" who complained about the
number of married women em
ployed in Tacoma stores.
Two married women wrote the
mayor Monday, explaining ]ust
why married women ere filling the
positions of young girls.
"My answer is that married
women work because employers do
not pay their husbands enough to
support them," wrote one of them.

"UMATILLA. Ore., Dec. 18.—Umatilla is still giggling "hysterically today
and a trifle apprehensively—over the fact that the new year is to put thif town
under a ''petticoat government."
The nation may have heen sonic surprised when it wakened the other morn
ing to learn that this railroad town on toe Columbia river had elected a woman
mayor, four women council members, a woman treasurer and a woman re
corder—that the women, in fact, had gained control, absolute, of the city gov
ernment.
But the nation wasn't one-half so surprised as was Umatilla itself, includ
ing the victors. It all started as a joke a week before election, at a card party.
It was considered so much of a joke by the men-folks that they paid no atten
tion to it; and hence they neglected to campaign for their own candidates.
But though the campaign was
waged as a joke, the women have
been looking around a hit a'neo

—America must push her prepar

and find her still witli pending in- 1
ternational difficulties or with
militarism still uncrushed abroad,
many congressmen warned today.
These senators and representa
tives frankly admitted that behind
their warnings lies thought of still
unsettled submarine difficulties
with Germany and possible dif
ference* that may arise with Japan
with connection with the immigra
tion bill which recently passed the
senate.
They were emphatic in declar
ing agalnat "alarmist warnings,"
but insisted it wn not safe for the

the fat."

But the two most nuconifort
able men in town are C. G.
Ilrownell and A. B. Stephens,
councilmen, holdovers fionj the
pratent regime to the "petticoat"
reign.
Two men In a group of seven
women, they are facing a hope
less majority with misgivings.
They daily acrept blUShlßfljf the
coiiiini»eralions of retiring offi
cials, and hearken hopefully to
the distant rumoring* that Praa
ttlla's women may start a recall
against them.
Tlie new mayor announces that
in seating the council she i« kojdk
to put the two holdoverH each be
tween two women, to keep them
out of mischief.
The election had dozens of dis
concerting and precedent-upset
ting features to It.
For Instance, Mrs. Robert Mer
rick defeated the husband of Mrs.
Hoy I<\ Faulu for treasurer. And
.Mrs. Paulu, to square matters, de
feated Mrs. Mcrrick's husband
for councilman.
A Woman Mhi-hlihl!
If there Is one thing that has
the women worried more than an
other, it Is the very good prob
ability that a woman will be
marshal. There are rumors to
that effect. The new mayor
doesn't deny It, any more than
she denies that "while the town's
morals are good, they might lie
better."
" 'I'm not sure a marshal is
necessary," she said. "However,
If there Is to be one, it will be a
woman!"
Wherefore, It would appear
that further rumors to the effect
that a very heavy, muscular
woman, formerly a waitress In a
local eating house, Is en route
[ from Alaska to assume police
powers, are not without founda
tion In fact.
Mayor "Speck" - who gained
this cognomen from his single-dot
telegraph signature—shakes his
head, mournful-like.
Plaintively he recalls the "good
old days" when cowboys from the
Horse Heaven country came to
town en masse and rode right Into
the saloons and chop suey houses,
aboard their "hroncs." He tells
how the cowboys playfully roped
pedestrians and dragged them at
a gallop up and down "the main
stem."
Times do change! Peace, pur
ity, quiet, respectability will settle
like a white mantle over Urna
tilla with the coming of its "pet
ticoat government."
