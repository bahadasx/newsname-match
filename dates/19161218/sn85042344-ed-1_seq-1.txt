About Disarmament.
Heferrlnn to the possibility of alle
viating the hurdeii of aruiainents the
Zeitiing expresses the belief that an
agreement to this effect is possible
owing to the sufferings caused by
war. and adds:
"Hut Germany must not be asked to
precede the others In reducing her
forces. Moreover, Germany does not
believe in abrognting general military
sen lee, altho there are many objec
tions against such. It would be abro
gated if there were a common organ
ization of nations in which Germany
would have an important place."
lirilaiu Musi Step Down.
Discussing the naval (ticstlnn, the
papir explains thai Germany's fleet
has been built only for defensive pur
poses and continues:
"If German ship building is to be
restricted in the future, other naval
powers including the Pnited Slates
must do likewise. Great ''rltain most
recognize the sea as a free route for
all nations and must renounce domi
