While argeis : nr o'er Bethlehem's

■Be Peace on earth, to men Good

Ring happy bells, o'er plain and
hill—
Ring loud, ring clear, ring sweet,
and fill
The souls of those who pause to hear
With reverent thought and Christ
mas cheer.
Swing wide the hearts' closed door,
and say
Come in!—all men are kin today!
Come in—come in! Clask hands, and
break
The Bread of friendship for the sake
Oh Him who came to earth to find
His brothers in all humankind."
Ring happy bells, the earth around,
And girdle it with gladdest sound,
And, while we sing His birthday in,
Let Christ—and Christ ish loveJbe
gin
His reign of peace, and men shall
say,
"This is indeed a Christmas day!"
Your hand, my brother! Lo afar,
eBhold the raidant Bethlehem star—
And Hark!—the angels singing still,
"Peace on earth, to men Good Will."

The pulpit of the Methodist
church at the morning hour was fill
ed by General Secretary Pierce of
the S. S. World Association who
delivered a very strong discourse on
the value and use of the Bible. In
his quiet way, he is : most forcef H
speaker, and his illustrations ar •
telling. He and Mr. Van Carter.
Secretary of the Louisiana S. S.
Association spoke to the children at
the Sunday Schol hour and warned
them ever to be a "Never Fail."
There was special music at the
morning services, a duet exquisitely!.
sung by Mr. and Mrs. Munro, and
a "Prayer" Solo by Mrs. E. A. Pharr
whose musical diction and rendition
of it was highly artistic.
Mr. Vanderbilt and family of
Westvego, La., have moved to Mor
gan City. The gentleman is employ
ed by the Louisiana Land Planting
Co., owners or some 35,000 or 40,
000 acres of marsh land below
Avoca. It seems that this company
will begin operations soon to re
claim a part of the vast body of
marsh land and Mr. Vanderbilt is
^connected with the enterprise.
