armed with a long dagger early Sun
day morning In the vicinity of the

negro. .- - I
The total haul of the negro was two;
watches valued at About $30 each and
$G65 in money.. He obtained the
watches and money from James B.
Porter, who was quarterback rdn 'the
freshman football team, and Robert S.
Clough, a senior In the College1 of Ag
riculture. ,The negro attempted to
rob Charles H. May. a freshman In the
College of Arts and Science, but May
used his fist on the highwayman and
ran Into the Phi Gamma Delta house.
Anton Stankowski, Tiger quarterback,
was the fourth one to be stopped by
the negro, but "Stan" escaped by mak
ing a run of about three hundred
yards.
The police have made no arrests In
connection with the robberies.
Students and Police Ih Search.
Armed with revolvers and numerous
i other weapons, such as pieces of Iron
. pipe, rocks, stove pokers, clubs, skates
and canes, a posse of about thirty stu
dents and two policemen scoured the
campuses and negro settlements of
the city until 4 o'clock yesterday
morning. Stankowski carried a big
baseball bat.
All descriptions agree that the foot
pad was a negro, about 5 feet G inches
tall, and weighing about 140 pounds.
He wore a brown siouch hat and dark
clothes. Small men seemed to be to
the particular liking of the highway
man, for Just before he held up Stan
kowski he passed upFrank L. Mc
Anaw. the big Tiger guard.
Probably the first one to be stopped
was May. He was In front of the Phi
Gamma Delta house on College ave
nue when he was grasped by the wrist

for a weapon. May struck him Jn the-
Jaw with his free hand, and .ran.

'.'Jimmy" Porter and the negro met 1
on University avenue, near Matthews
street. Porter was Just two doors
from his room, at 403 Matthews. The
negro was carrying a lighted red lan
tern, and Porter noticed the moving
red light as he was coming north
across the East Campus, returning
from the M men's dance.
"Gimme a match!" the negro called.
Porter was singing at the time, and,
after saying that he did not have a
match, he started to walk on.
' "Stop or I'll shoot," commanded the
negro, as he started toward Porter.
The smell of whisky was on the ne
gro's breath, when he tore open Por
ter's coat and placed the knife Just
above his heart. Even then. Porter
says he "kidded" with him for a cou
ple of minutes, and the negro acted as
if he had just enough whisky In him
to make him feel good. When "Jimmy"
said he had no money, the negro went
through his pockets and took six $1
bills and his watch. Then the hold
up man took the knife in his other
hand and made Porter shake hands
with him.
The money taken from Porter was
given him by Stankowski in payment
of a debt not more than an hour "be
for the holdup.
Different Tactics Are Tried.
Not more than ten minutes after the
Porter hold-up the 'negro accosted
Clough on the north side of University
avenue, Jus,t across from the Biology
Building. This time his lantern was
not burning, and he asked Clough for,
a match. Thinking he was a street
worker Clough began going through
his pockets, when the negro stepped
np and showed hs knife. He used dif
ferent tactics this time.
"You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?" he said. "You've been out
to see a girl, haven't you? How much
money have you got?"
When Clough dug up 65 cents, which

was all he had, the negro became
abusive, calling him all kinds of names
and at the same time threatening him
with the knife. He kept this up for
several minutes, but finally had
Clough take off his overcoat and un
button his vest. He went through
Clough's vest pockets, taking the
watch and a small knife. Again curs
ing and threatening to shoot, he told
Clough to "beat it" and watched him
until he was half a block away.
"Stan's" Happiness Is Marred.
Stankowski was on his way to his
room .in Benton Hall from the M
men's dance and met the negro on Hitt
street, about half-way betweenLowry
street and Conley avenue.
"It was the first time I had ever
taken -a girl to a dance," said "Stan"
thk morning, "and I was feeling real
happy. ,The negro stopped when about
fifteen feet from me, and I walked up
to hinrlike a lamb to the slaughter. He
had bis knife waiting for me; so I ac
commodated him by stopping."
"Give me all the money you have,"
said the negro as he flourished the
knife.
Stankowski argued that he didn't
have any money, but when the hold
up man started to bring his knife
down, the Tiger quarter asked him
how much he wanted.
"Four dollars," the negro replied.
"That's too much," returned "Stan."
"Unbutton your overcoat," was the
next command. "Now give me your
watch."
"Excuse me, nigger, I'm gone," said
'8taa
"Stan." Makes Opea-Fleld Ban.
And then he pnt his football exper
ience to advantage. Quickly dodging
under the knife, he started to run
south on Hltt street Before he had
gone twenty-five feet, he fell trying tp
climb a small terrace, but got up just
as the negro fell in the same place.
The Tiger quarter then skirted
around the corner of Hitt street and
Conley avenue.
"Near the Missouri store," said
"Stan" today, "I thought I heard the
echoes of my footsteps, but looking
back 'I saw my friend not more than
twenty-five feet away. He followed me
to the'Palms, and then 'dodged off Into
the underbrush on the West Campus,
Just across the street I never ran
faster against Kansas than I did last
night"
Stankowskl's trousers were torn as
he fellsdown, but -that was his, only
loss. ,
The negro did not have his lantern
jthen he accosted Stankowski, and this
'was later found in the center of the
street at University and College ave

iTwo other students were called to
by a negro who answers the descrip

work, bul'ho attempt was made to rob
them. About midnight a negro carry
ing a red lantern called to O. V. Bat
son as he was passing the Missouri
Union Building and asked, "Where

half drunk. '
Near College avenue and Rosemary
lane, a negro, also carrying a lantern,
asked F. M. Tatum for a match, but
Tatum ran and Uie negro did not at

All the men held up were on their
way home from dances.

ARMY ACT PROPOSED
Senator Hughes of New Jer
sey Favors Training 250,
000 Men for Service.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec 18. America
must push her preparedness plan now
lest peace come and find Internation
al difficulties still pending or militar
ism still encouraged abroad, many
congressmen warned today. The
warning was called forth by a series
of stories carried by the United Press
telling how New York was literally
"rolling and rollicking in wealth" and
the entire country playing Its part
without any apparent thought for the
future.
These senators and representatives
frankly admitted that behind the
warning He the thoughts of unsettled
submarine differences with Germany
and possible difficulties in connection
with the immigration bill which re
cently passed the Senate. They were
emphatic in declaring against "alarm
ist warnings," but insisted that it Js
not safe for the United States ti t"
"satisfied with financial fatness and
with no sinew behind the fat"
Senator Hughes of New Jersey came,
out with p. proposal for an army of
250,000, at least, to serve two years
with the colors and four as rese
Ists, so that 125,000 men would ;u back
annually into civil life, giving loO,
000 trained men in ten years.

Present System a Failure.
By United Press ,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. Nofhing
could be more pronounced than the
"complete failure of the mobilizaUon
of the militia forces along the border,"
declared Major General Leonard Wood,
former chief of staff, before the Sen
ate Committee on Military Affairs to
day. "Not one half of the regular or
militia uriits on the border today are
at full war strength." said Wood. "We
have no defense. We are unprepared.
The only way to get it is by the uni
versal military training system. We
must get it now; and we must get it
quickly."
Wood gave his sentences with ring
ing crispness. He referred to the
statement of former Secretary of the
Interior Fisher, who suggested the
plan for "civic training with military
featured as a bi-product," as a play on
words.
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief
of staff, said the staff officers had de
cided that the 'initial force of the
United States in case of war should
not be less than 1,500,000 "equipped,
perfectly trained and seasoned, men."

URGE
SAYS AN ART MUSEUM
LDAI
Curator of Toledo Institu
tion, M. U. Alumnus,
Tells of Benefit.
WOULD BRING GIFTS
Legislature and the Alumni
Should Provide for the
Building.
An art museum as a foundation for
a more beautiful Columbia, is the sug
gestion.ot Blake-More Godwin, A. B.,
'15, now curator of the Toledo Art
Museum, who is visiting his brother,
a student in the University.
Mr. Godwin goes on the assumption
that art is not for the exclusive use
of the "high-brows" but can be hu
manized so as to become a molding
factor in our exeryday life. An art
museum in Columbia, he asserts,
would educate the people and city ad
ministration ,'p an abhorrence of the
Junk heaps and unlovely structures
which now grace'the city.
"The University and Columbia have
no art collections because they have
no safe place to put paintings and
statues," says Mr. Godwin, ')Men of
means in Missouri would gladly pre
sent the University with worthy
works of art if they were assuredthat
their gifts would be placed in a fire
proof structure. Our museum at To
ledo cost $300,000 bnt a building erect
ed at the University at one-fifth of
this cost would be the magnet which
would soon draw a collection of art
to Columbia. ,
The collection at Toledo started
with the ,mummy of an Egyptian cat
but a building was secured anyway
and gifts of rare works of art soon
began to come in. Now, some of the
a tides in the museum can not be
duplicated.
Mr. Godwin believes that art is for
everyone. This dally contact with the
beautiful would develop a greater ap
preciation of the things around us. To
show the importance of art in civic
life he told how the lack of it al
most lost Toledo its growth. Al
though one of the largest railway cen
ters in the central west this city
posessess an ugly union station.
Willys, the automobile manufacturer,
while in search of a location for his
factories, had to be dragged from the
train at Toledo and be shown the
shop3 left by the Pope Manufacturing
Company, because the unlovely aspect
of the union station led him to believe
that the people of the city were 'as
slovenly as their artistic taste. .Since
then the chance that Toledo almost
missed has doubled her population
through the establishment of the
Willys-Overland Company.
"The Crying need for a small art
museum here should be put before
the legislature," says the visitor. "If
they are unable to appropriate funds
for the structure our alumni will
surely come to the rescue. The Uni
versity is not yet old enough to have
produced millionaire alumni but the
time is almost here when her gradu
ates will have accumulated sufficient
wealth to support the museum we
need and which will surely make the
already progressive Columbia a better
and more beautiful city."

Merchants Say Saturday Bus

Cent Increase Over 1915.
Saturday was one of the biggest
shopping-days Columbia merchants
have ever had. ''The stores were so
full of people that one could scarcely
wedge his way through the crowd.
Even with the extra clerks that have
been added to the regular forces, it
was almost impossible to get waited
upon.
Merchants say that the Christmas
shopping is being done rather late. In
fact, the people haven't realized that
Christmas is so near at hand. Many
of the, merchants. say that there was
an increase of 25 to SO ,per.cent, in
business over that of the same Sat
urday last year.
People are spending more money
this year than last, the merchants
claim, but it is being spent for more
practical gifts. One dry goods man
said that where people bad heretofore
bought fancy and impractical things,
the same people were this year buy
ing more expensive and more service
able gifts.

Columbia merchants say they have

OFFICIALS SAY PEACE
ISARUENT
U.S. Authorities Believe Teu
tons Should Restore Bel
gium and Serbia.
PEOPLE ARE RESTIVE
Lloyd-George Is Expected to
Outline In His Speech the
Terms of the Allies.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. United
States officials are convinced today
that there can be no formal , discus
sion of'peace until Germany and Aus
tria avow a willingness to restore Bel
gium and Serbia and until all the na
tions involved are ready to disarm on
a large scale.
In his forthcoming speech, David
Lloyd-George, British premier, is ex
pected to insist on such terms as a
fundamental groundwork for any for
mal parley, and such action on his
part would sene to "pass the buck"
back to Germany. Moreover, officials
believe he will outyne fully what the
Allies are fighting for, but in no cir
cumstances will he voice a scornful
or fiat refusal 'of Germany's offer.
The United Press is in , a. position
today to give a detailed outline of this
Government's convictions on the sev
eral angles of peace. They are:
It Is believed that Germany's offer
of peace was caused because the Ger
man people were becoming resUve. It
is believed that the people of all coun
tries, America included, want peace,
as long as there is no sacrifice of
principles for which fighting has been
going on. No reason is seen why
Lloyd-George, when he addresses the
Commons tomorrow, should fall to
outline the general peace terms of
the Allies. Unequivocal rejection of
the. Teutons would immediately act to
England's' disadvantage in' neutral
countries; It is believed here.
Britons Await Reply With Interest.
By United Press
LONDON, Dec. 18. When Premier
David Lloyd-George addresses Parlia
ment tomorrow and outlines the poli
cy of his government, he will find the
pulse of the British people beating in
unison with that of the war council.
Interest is Intense tonight in the re
ply the premier will make to the
peace proposals and his discussion of
the'food investigation and the question
of man-power.
The temper of the British people to
ward peace was Indicated when a mob
yesterday attacked Sylvia Pankhurst
as ai"paciflst"-With a group of sym
pathasizers she attempted to hold a
demonstration to demand peace.
It is expected that Lloyd-George will ,
give tn his speeeh a brief and compre
hensive review of the war and will
outline what has been accomplished
under the old regime and what be ex
pects to accomplish with the new war
council.
