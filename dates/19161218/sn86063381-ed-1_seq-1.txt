SLEEP SIX NIGHTS IN
WOODS WITHOUT FIRE
You folks when you get up these
risp mornings and complain of the
fire in the furnace, how'd you like
to sleep six nights out in the woods
in a tent this weather? But that's
what Nils A. Otterstad, representing
the Clark Pole & Tie company, and
J. J. Opsahl of the Red River Lumber
company did on a jaunt of sixteen
days they have just completed look
ing over the timber in township 63,
range 24. A portion of the time they
'occupied a camp established by some
^parties from Stillwater.
The trip was a hard one and in
the course of the cruise Mr. Otter
stad bad the "pleasure" of missing
stepping on a big bear by about six
inches. He had just climbed over
the root of a huge tree and jumped
to the opposite side. Bruin was
sound asleep and Mr. Otterstad had
no intention of disturbing his slum
bers as he was unarmed at the time.

FALSE ALARM OF FIRE
COSTS CITY THIRTY DOLLARS
It cost Bemidji about $30 yester
day afternoon for the members of the
fire department to make a run and
take a look at the newly erected
warming house erected by the city
on the lake where the new rink is
located. There was no fire and Some
one with a "funny" inclination sent
in a false alarm.
And while mentioning this, a
smoky flue late last week got an
other individual excited and an alarm
was turned in, causing more need
less expense.
CITY FATHERS HELP
ASSOCIATED CHARITIES
The fact that there are no city
poor charges this winter, enriches the
coffers of the Associated Charities by
$30 for their work of bringing cheer
to the worthy poor this) Christmas,
the sum having been appropriated by
the city council as the city's share
toward the noble undertaking.
The fact that the city authorities
have no "regulars" at this time
caused them to turn the appropria
tion over to the association which
will render an account of its ex
penditure to the city.
CHICAGO SHIVERS WHILE
COAL SUPPLY IS SHORT
Chicago, Dec. 18.Shivering from
the cold wave sweeping the shores
of Lake Michigan, Chicagoans learn
ed they face a coal famine within a
week. Coal experts estimated the
largest available supply in any dis
trict of the city could not hold out
more than 10 days.
A statement that G. W. Anderson,
special assistant to the attorney gen
eral, is looking into the coal short
age, was made at the office of the
United States district attorney.
Government investigators, accord
ing to the statement, "are engaged on
the problem of how far the high
price of coal and other necessaries
in Chicago are due to combinations
obnoxious! to the anti-trust laws."
Mr. Anderson is quoted as saying:
"No one has any right to give cur
rency to the idea that a famine either
in coal or in any other necessity ex
ists, because such reports simply play
into the hands of speculators and
would-be promoters* of illegal cor-
ners."
GOVERNORS DEMAND THE
RETURN OF THEIR MILITIA
Washington, Dec 18 With prac
tically every governor in the country,
whose troops are still on the Mex
ican border, demanding their return,
Secretary of War N. D. Baker de
clined to intimate when the national
guard will be brought home.
Governor E. F. Dunne of Iillinois
called on the secretary to request im
mediate return of all Illinois troops
remaining on the border. Mr. Baker
was busy when the governor reached
his office and so Mr. Dunne conveyed
his* request through Senator Thomas
Walsh, Jr, of Montana. Senator
Walsh added his recommendation
that the governor's request be acted
upon favorably. Governor Dunne es
pecially wants the men home by
Christmas and if it is impossible to
get them back then, he wants them
in Illinois not later than Jan. 1.

WET AND DRY LINEUP
ENGROSSES NEBRASKA
(By United Press)
Lincoln, Neb Dec. 18.With the
convening of the Nebraska legisla
ture's thirty-fifth session here Jan
uary 2, interest will center on the
wet and dry lineup and the legisla
tive battle for laws to make effective
the dry amendment passed by almost
30,000 majority at the recent elec
tion.
The wets, realizing that prohibi
tion would carry, centered their fight
toward the last on winning enough
members of the legislature to block,
if possible, passage of laws aimed to
make prohibition effective.
The drys have a slight majority in
the house. In the senate the ma
jority of the members are personally
wet, but of the thirty-three members,
six are known as "law-enforcements."
These are men who before election
admitted that they -were personally
not in favor of prohibition but would
be governed as legislators by the ver
dict of the people on the prohibition
amendment. These "law-enforce
ments" combined with the drys out
number the out-and-out wets in the
senate.
CITY JAIL LONESOME.
The city jail presented a lonesome
appearance last night, no lodgers be
ing accommodated. During the past
couple of days Chief Ripple and his
men have been active in cleaning the
city of "floaters" and all who can
not give an account satisfactory to
the police are invited to make a few
tracks with their heels toward Be
midji.
COLD CAUSES SHIVERING.
Just what it was all about is a
mystery, but general complaint was
heard this morning and throughout
the day of the cold. The school farm
register indicated 14 below at 6
o'clock this morning but the air
seemed raw and a general shivering
on the part of pedestrians and all
others was the result.
MEET THIS EVENING.
It should be borne in mind that
the committees appointed to promote
a Carnival association for Bemidji
will meet this evening in the Com
mercial club rooms. The future work
of the association is to be outlined
and discussed and all committee mem
bers should be present.
IMPORTANT MEETING
The regular meeting of the Com
mercial club will be held tomorrow
night and it is urged that all mem
bers be present as there are matters

Failed to Hasten to Relief of Chi
huahua City During Recent
Bandit Attack.
TREVINO GOES TO CAPITOL
TO CONFER WITH HIS CHIEF
Denies His Evacuation of Chihuahua
Has Been Criticized Says
Ammunition Short.
(By United Press)
El Paso, Dec. 18.It is intimated
that First Chief Carranza will insti
tute an investigation into the con
duct of General Murguia for failure
to go to the relief of Chihuahua City
during the bandit attacks three
weeks ago.
General Trevino left last night for
Mexico City for a conference with
President Carranza. He denies that
his action in evacuating the city has
been criticised by the Mexican ad
ministration.
Lack of ammunition and fear for
the safety of the non-combatants
caused the abandonment of the north
-era capital, he stated.
According to Trevino, Murguia
stayed six days in Santa Rosalia, 25
miles' from Chihuahua City, when
the attack was begun and failed to
go to the aid of the city.
Early Solution Near.
Philadelphia, Dec. 18.An early
solution of the Mexican border prob
lems hinges on the action of the
Mexican American commissioners
who reconvened here today. Albert
J. Pani, who carried the Atlantic
City proctocol to Carranza, arrived
here last night with an answer from
Carranza.

to avert a threatened strike.

Ireland has lessened, according to a
Central News dispatch from Dublin,
and trains are running as usual.
WOLF OR DOG? PUZZLE
AT AUDITOR'S OFFICE
There's a mystery at the court
housea deep, dark mystery, and
it is all about the identity of a hide
that reposes peacefully in the county
auditor's office under the guise of a
wolf hide.
The question under discussion is,
is it a wolf or a healthy specimen of
a farm dog? There is a difference of
opinion among those who have view
ed the pelt and it seems as if it would
have to be taken up before Presi
dent Wilson to appoint a board of
arbitration.
Meanwhile, Deputy Auditor Alsop
isn't saying a word. When asked for
an opinion his only answer was a
smile.

St. Paul, Minn., Dec. 18.Attor-
ney General Lyndon A. Smith is
drafting a bill for introduction in the
next legislature providing for the
establishment of state owned paper
mills on state timber lands* as pro
posed by the Minnesota Editorial as
sociation following the conclusion
that the situation as to the 1917 sup
ply of print paper is so serious as to
threaten discontinuance of many
Minnesota newspapers).
A draft of the bill was urged by
Frank A .Day of the Fairmont Sen
tinel, and secretary to Governor John
A. Johnson,\Chairman Herman Roe
of the Northfield News and other
publishers on the legislative commit

VILLISTAS TAKE JIMINEZ:
SEVERS SUPPLY CHANNEL

swiftly southward, Villisita forces
have captured Jiminez and are in
possession of that city as well as
Santa Rosalia, the only important
point between them and Chihuahua
City, according to advices reaching
mining companies here today.
The occupation of these two towns
by bandit forces effectually severs the
only channel of supplies' and ammu
nition for General Murguia's govern
ment army in the north.
The town of Jiminez is an im
portant railway junction on the road
to Torreon. The railway line from
Parral joins the national lines at

CHANCE FOR BUSINESS.
Chicago, Dec. 18.There is plenty
of room and a welcome for the Am
erican business man in Russia to
day. And clean cut business methods
will get him much in the land of the
Cossjjck as in his own United States.
The business* man who wants to
be "babied" had better stay away.
Sitting on the doorstep of a Russian
ministry waiting a handout of juicy
orders, will bring only an order to
beat it. No use, either, working on
the theory that one has to "culti-
vate." The American who tries to
bribe his way there is a chump.
There is a huge demand for manu
factured goods.
