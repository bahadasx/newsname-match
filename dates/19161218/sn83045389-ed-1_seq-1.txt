Before Commons.
my AK?orlat?>! I'reK.i.)
WASHINGTON, December 17.?Fred
erick C. Walcott, of New York, who
recently Investigated conditions In Po
land and BelKlum for the Rockefeller
Foundation, told a number of Senators
and Representatives who met to-night
at the home of Miss Mabel T. Board
man, of the Rod Cross. that a fund of
1B00,000.000 collected In this country
and ofTered for relief of noncombatunts
In Europe would be a powerful peace
Influence at this time. Me said such
an act would tend to create popular
demonat ration 8 for peace am on civil
ian populations of warrlns nations, be
causo they would be anxious for the
assistance In rehabilitating: their homes
and restoring normal living conditions
Mr. Walcott suggested that a fund
of that Blze should bo raised by com
bined popular subscriptions and con
gressional appropriations. Considering
the wealth of the United States, he de
clared It was not an exorbitant sum
to give. Since 1914 the estimated
aggregate accumulating Income has
been 000.000,300, and the combine')
offerings for war sufferers has
amounted to 140.000.000. or one
twentieth of 1 per cent of the In
come.
With forwarding the notes of the
central powers proposing peace pro
posals, official and diplomatic <juar
t"rs are now awaiting with the pro
foundost Interest some word Indicat
ing what r.atvr# of replies may be ex
ported from the entente powers
President Wilson, it was Indicated
at the White House to-day. Is wait*
in?; for the speech to bo delivered I
'he House of Commons by the new
Hrttlsh Prime Minister. I,loyd Geor;.
before taking any further action ?
behalf of peace. The next move is
up to the allies, and It Is the view
of administration officials that noth
ing could he Rained now hv the pres
entation of any suggestions or offers
on the part of the United States gov*
ernment.
OI'KEH WILL \OT IJB
FLATLY HKJRCTKD
Intimations that the Gorman offer
to discuss peace would not be flatly
rejected by the allies have been re
ceived In Washington. While ti)os?
were o f an Informal nature, tlvy
were sufficiently strong to convince
(he President that a more opportune
occasion for action by this government
would. In all probability, be presented
after the receipt of the allied answer
(o the German note.
It was argued that If the allies were
?olng to give due consideration to the
German proposal, nothing could be
gained now by urging them to do so.
nnd. In fact, such action by the
United States might put the adminis
tration In a position where It would
be more difficult to offer meditation or
suggestions for a conference at a later
stage of the proceedings. This Is un
derstood to have been the view also
of several neutral legations, and It was
shared to a certain extent by the Teu
tonic embassies.
Lloyd George's speech, which he Is
scheduled to deliver in the House of
Commons next Tuesday, |? expected to
contain a hint as to what form of ac
iton. if any, hy neutrals would not be
unwelcome to the British government.
It may also foreshadow the reply of the
allies to the peace proposals. For these
reasons the President Is waiting, and
his action thereafter will largely be
guided by the tenor of that speech.
PRESIDKJIT OPTIWl.STIC
0\ Rfi CHAXTK OK Sl'CCH.HS
It was stated positively to-dav that
the President has definite plans which
he hopes to put into effect, nnd that
he Is optimistic regarding the possi
bility of some good coming from the
German offer.
It is not believed here, however, that
Lloyd George win deliver the speech
ns early as Tuesday. When he was
too 111 to speak last Thursday, atten
tion was called In neutral embassies
to the exceeding delicacy of the situa
tion, and the prediction was then made
that it would be several days, at least,
before he would recover sufficiently to
outline the government's position.
No surprise was experienced to-day
therefore, when the dispatches from
London Indicated that the Premier had
temporarily lost the use of his voice.
The prediction was freely hazarded that
?t would be a week or ten days longer
before he would recover Its use suffi
cient^ to outline the attitude of his
government regarding the German pro
posals. Tt was pointed out that Eng
land would have to consult with her
allies before she wo-,id make known
her position, and that communication
in some Instances Is slow and difficult
??nf, J"1? reasons that actuated
President Wilson not to make any sug

Responsibility for Rejec
tion of Weapon.
WASHINGTON, December 17.?Of- j
flclal condemnation of the Lewis m;i- 1
| chine gun, extensively purchased for
the British and Canadian armies, Is
expressed in a formal statement issued
by Secretary Baker, assuming full re
nponslblllty for the action of the War
Department, with respect to the much
dlsrussed weapon, and directing that j
controversy among army officers over
It cease.
"Whatever responsibility attaches to I
the condemnation of this gun as a
service gun belongs to the War De
partment." the statement asserts, "and
not to the chief of ordnance or the
ordnance department. The proceed
ings of the boards which tested the |
rifle have b?en In ea'-h case duly ap- I
proved by the Secretary of War."
The statements show that the In
spector-ger.erai was directed to inves
tigate the whole matter of the treat
ment of the Lewis Kim, named after
I its inventor, a former army officer,
j when "the controversy reached the
stag" where open letters from high
rankinir army officers were published."
A board of officers already had agreed
j with previous boards that the gun I
was not suitable for extensive pur- ;
chase for the army.
The inspector-general's conclusions |
are reported In to-day's statement. '
In addition to the two paragraphs !
already quoted, he finds no official '
; record that Colonel Lewis eyer offered
his nun in any way to the United |
1 Stated government; that the American !
Arms Company In 1513 made the only'
offer of 1)0 guns at $1,000 each, with
license for government manufacture
on a royalty basis; that tests of the
gun wore conducted by regularly con
stituted boards; that the Savage Arms
Company in April of this year wrote
General Crozier, chief of ordnance, ex
pressing entire satisfaction with the
work of the last board; that thf gun's
\ failure to pass Its endurance test
| caused its exclusion from field tests,
| and. finally, that:
"The records do not show any hos- i
r11 itv upon the part of General Crozier,
of the ordnance department, to the
Lewis gun, but do show that the de
partment, by direction of Its chief,
afforded the owners of the gun every ,
possible facility In placing it before

Use in Insufficient Quantities
Results in Spread of Tumor
Rather Than Reduction.
j /
VERY STRICT LIMITATIONS
Head of Research Fund at Col
umbia University Reports
Results of Tests.
NEW YORK, December 17.?Many
dangers beset the use of radium in the
: treatment of cancer tumors. Dr. Kriin
' els Carter Wood points out In his an
nual report to Dr. Nicholas Murray
I Hutler, president of Columbia Univer
sity. The report was issued to-day.
Dr. Wood Is at the head of the
Crocker i'ancer Research Fund at Co
lumbia University, which has the in
come from $3.00ft.000. He has under
him a distinguished corps of investi
gators at the laboratories on Morning
side Heights.
? i
After experiments on thousands of;
mice, guinea pigs and other animals.'
: Dr. Wood finds the use of radium in
; some cases, and in insufllclent quanti
ties. results in the spread of the tumor
rather than its reduction. He asserts
radium is Inferior to the knife as a
method of treatment of the usual can
cerous growth, and sanctions the use
of radium only in inoperable cases, and
then only under very strict limitations.
Dr. Wood's report says:
"Since the opening of the laboratory,
more than 10.000 microscopic sections,
chiefly of tumor material, have been
i examined and (lied for reference.
"During the year, the fund received .
5fi0 mice bearing spontaneous tumors,
among them a number of new and ln
I terestlng types, which have been trans
planted.
j WITHOUT (TIIATIVK KKFKCT
OX TUMOils IX ANIMAL,*
"During the year a number of so
called cures were investigated, hut it i
was shown that none possessed the |
( sliKhtest curative i ITect on tumors In '
1 animals. They cannot, therefore, be
| expected to Influence human cancer,
j "In continuation of work on the
| therapeutic action of radium, we have
j endeavored, with large doses, to in
; fluence a sarcoma of the guinea pig.
This Is slow growing, and therefore
j more suitable for making tests of the
value of this physical agent than are
the tumors of mice, as the death of
the animal Is less likely to result.
"While the size of some of tho. tumors
I treated was slightly reduced. In others
j crowth was more rapid than before,
"nd in no case was any cure effected.
"As a by-product to this lnvestlga-l
tlon, Dr. Frederick Prime has been
able to add Interesting confirmation to
the work of certain zoologists on
lower animals in showing that radium
in small doses also has a distinctly
stimulating effect upon mammalian
cells, such as occur in tumors, while
large doses Just Insufficient to kill the
neoplasm may reduce the rate of
j growth considerably.
| "This explains many of the reports
by physicians treating human tumors
to th<> effect that a growth disappeared,
I hut returned after being quiescent for
a considerable period. In some of
these human cases the tumors have j
? remained latent for one or two years, i
only to grow later and resist any
j further radium treatment.
POIXT TO XKCKSJUTY OF
VKitV t'A IlICFl't, STUDY
"These experiments are thus of
practical importance because they show
that in treating a tumor of any size,
unless very large quantities of the
radium are used, the portions of the
: tumor at a considerable distance from
: the radium may he stimulated and
prow more rapidly, even though locally
' the tumor may diminish in size?and
! they point to the necessity of careful
study of the nature, extent and dls- ?
tribution of a human tumor before a i
decision is made as to whether radium
can Justifiably be applied therapeuti
cally.
"Despite tiie fact that it is becom
ing more and more evident, not only
from our work, but also from the pub
lished reports of others, that radium
cannot be regarded as a satisfactory]
method for the cure of malignant;
tumors, there is- no question but that i
it is the best palliative treatment we
i have in cases of inoperable recurrence
, after previous surgical removal of the.
1 mass of the prowth.
"It is unquestionably possible to pro
. long life In a few instances and t
make tho patient more comfortable l>v
the judicious and intelligent employ
ment of large quantities of radium."
