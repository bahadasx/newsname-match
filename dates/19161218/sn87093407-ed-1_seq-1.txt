MENACE OF BRITISH
AND JAPAN ARMIES
WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.- Maj. Gen.
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the army, to
day ripped the lid off the pot of opinion
which army staff and line men have brewed
over the border duty service of the National
Guard.
Gen. Scott also voiced the army men's
verdict on the system of national defense
now in vogue in this country.
Going into some of the secret workings
of the army war college plan for adequate
defense, Scott told the sub-committee of the
Chamberlain senate military committee that
where it was once believed 500,000 men, to
be available at the outset of any hostilities
in which this nation engaged, would be suffi
cient "as a starter," lessons learned from the
European war led staff officers to decide this
initial force should be not less than 1,500,000
equipped, seasoned, perfectly trained troops.
"In vlfir of the rhanifM that l
