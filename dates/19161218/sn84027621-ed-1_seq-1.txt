Laredo, Dec. 11. With the Second
Florida regiment and a battery of
regular artillery on the offensive and
the Second Missouri regiment and a
battery of artillery on the defensive,
the maneuvers of four days started
at 8 o'clock this morning. There was
an icy wind from the north, therefore
v.e were all there with a smart step.
The columns marched out north of
Laredo nine miles by 10:30. After a
30-minute rest the columns turned
and traversed the same route back to
within 100 yards . of camp, turning
east, . halting on the old Maine camp
grounds where "dog" tents ' were
pitched. At 4:30 ithere was a general
inspection of field equipment.
There was a "summer" meal serv
ed at 6 o'clock, some of dinner and
some of supper. All the men retired
early to their downy beds (down on
the ground).?
Santa Rosa Farm, 15 Miles from
Laredo, Dec. 12. At the break of day
every man was out of his tent hustling
around to keep from freezing, as
everything froze up, even the water
in our canteens. ' " '
The first thing was to get the men
who were froze out during the night
to the hospital. ' Camp was broke and
streets policed before breakfast and
blanket rolls made. Breakfast was
served at 6:30 and at. 7:30 the col
umn moved out, going southeast along
the Rio Grande for 15 miles, vf
This was one of the hardest hikes
we have ever taken, rocky roads, al
kali dust and a shortage of food and
water. . 4
Our destination was reached at
1:39, the men foot-sore and tired out.
There was an inspection of feet, shoes
and socks, finding many blistered feet,
the owners being too game to fall by
the wayside. When check was taken
"A" Company was five men short.
This was about the best record made,
other companies having as many as
14 men out.
Camp was pitched among the mes
quite bushes and cactus and a surplus
cf alkali dust. Supper was served at
('? o'clock, consisting of corned beef,
raw tomatoes and light bread. Dinner
is one meal that is eliminated during
maneuvers. It takes a day to hike to
a suitable place for camping. Through
shortage of water there was no coffee
on the menu,, one of the most benefi
cial drinks to a soldier.
At night, every man is as busy as a
dog 1 with a tin , can tied to his tail,

(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 18. -The aban
donment' of the volunteer military
system was recommended by the army
general staff because the time has
come when the United States, unless
it intends to avoid war at any cost,
must resort to universal military
tiaining, Major General Scott, chief
of staff of the army, told the Senate
military committee today. He assert
ed that universal training , would be
democratic, reliable, efficient and eco
nomical and within a few years would
practically render the United States
immune fr6m attack.
General Scott expressed the opinion
that for war with a first class power
the United States should have a mil
lion and a half troops ready at the
outbreak of hostilities with a million
and a half to follow in ninety days.
AN EXAMPLE BEFORE OUR EYES
i .
Gen. Scott based his opinion on the
development of the British army, the
organization of great Canadian forces
and the British alliance with Japan. ,

Quite a lot of activity was shown
by members of the Star's 3,000 Club
last week. Many of the members are
just getting started, while some have
actually gotten to work and are out
hustling for subscriptions. From the
published vote list, you will note quite
a change in the line-up, and with the
close of the triple vote offer in sight,
there will be a lot of changes in the
standings of the various members
by the end of the week.
Have you sent in that nomination?
If not clip the coupon, fill in your
name and address and mail or bring
it to the office today. Every day you
put it off will make it just that much
harder for you to earn , one of the
many prizes. There is no one who
can say that the Maxwell is won as
yet; in fact, the race is just starting
and the winner will not be known
until the announcement is made by
the judges when all the votes are
counted at the close on Jan. 20.
New nominations are coming in
every day and with these comes added
interest in the campaign. Those who
are not members of the club should
pick out a member and start boosting
for them today. The member will ap
preciate your support and it will mean
only a small effort on your part.
Subscribers can pay their subscrip
tions to the Star and cast their votes
for the member of their choice, pro-?
viding that they demand the votes at
the time of paying. A year's sub
scription to the Evening Star gives
30,000 votes up to Saturday night at
9 o'clock, Dec. 23, and this will be a
big help to any member of the club.
- Remember, that only five days re
main in which to get the triple votes.
Five dollars now will get you many
thousand more votes than' later and
it is votes that you will have to have
in order to win. It is not the most
money that will win the Maxwell, but
the most votes and you can get more
votes now for your subscriptions than
ever again. Put forth your best ef
forts this week and you will find that
it pays the best. . - .

Tokio, Dec. 17. The American
naval expansion program was the
subject of a lecture delivered recent
ly before the National Defense Asso
ciation by Commander Sosaburo Ta-
kabashi, a member of the navl staff
board. ;
The newspapers quote Commander
Takahashi as expressing the opinion,
that the "much talked of American
Japanese war was illusory and a mat
ter of impossibility but as holding
that it was a greater illusion a take
an optimistic view of America's policy
of preparedness. The speaker thought
it dangerous to take an easy view of
American naval expansion and em- -phatically
laid stress on the import
ance of the expansion of the imperial
navy with a view to keep in pace
with American preparedness. -
Commander Takahasi dwelt upon
the speedy construction of American
warships and the activity of Ameri
can shipbuilders. He referred to the
positive defense measures being elab
orately worked out by the United
States in the Pacific and Phillippines,
together with an extensive plan to
complete communications between the
American possessions in the Pacific.
Other speakers recommended the
establishment of additional iron foun
dries in Japan, pointing out how the
lack of them had been keenly felt by
the belligerent nations since the out
break of the war.
