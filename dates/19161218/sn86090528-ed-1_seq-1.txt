Premier Lloyd-George Expected to Outline
Allies Terms of Peace in Reply to
Teuton Proposals
GERMAN PEOPLE ARE
BECOMING RESTIVE
U. S. Government Attributes German In-'
itiative in Peace Move to Restless
ness ot Kaiser's Subjects
By United PreeB.
Washington, Dec. 18. United States
officials are said to be convinced that
there can be no formal discussion of
peace until Germany avows her wil
lingness to restore Belgium and Serbia
and until the nations involved in the
struggle are ready to disarm on a largo
scale.
In his forthcoming speech Premier
Lloyd-George of England is expected
to insist, that such terms must be the
fundamental ground work of anyj par
leys and such action would "pass the
buck" back to Germany. Moreover,
officials here believe the premier will
outline fully what the allies are fight
ing for but will not scorn the German
offers.
It is understood that the United
Statoj government today is convinced
concerning the following angles of
the peace discussion: It is believed
that Germany offered peace because
her people are becoming restive. It
is believed that the people of all
countries, America Included, want
peace so long as there is no sacrifice
of the principles for which they are
fighting. No formal discussion of the
matter is thought possible unless the
Teutons avow their willingness to re
store Serbia and Belgium. Lloyd
George tomorrow is expected to out
line the peace terms of the allies.

TATE GIVEN
FIGHT BY
WRITERS
Decision at Kansas City Stolen from
Chickasha Pugilist is Charge of
, Leading Newspapers
TATE HAD GEYER GOING
IN SEVERAL ROUNDS
Local Heavyweight was Victim of Ref
eree's "Brain Lapse" say
Sporting Writers
That Texas Tate should have been
given tho decision in the 12-round bout
with Jack Geyer at Kansas City Thurs
day night is the general verdict of
sporting writers both in Kansas City
and in St. Louis. That the Chickasha
heacyweight was again the victim of
an unfair decision is declared by lead
ing prize ring authorities who witness
ed the mill.
Freeman Alford, in tho Kansas City
Post, scores the referee in the follow
ing terms:
(By Freeman Alford.)
An unfortunate occurrence marked
the opening last nfght of the Oak A. C.
at Twelfth and Oak streets.
It was unfortunate to the club, to
the spectators and to the fighters, but
tho most particular victim of the epi
sode was Texas Tate, the Oklahoma
heavyweight, who received an unde
served blot on his record.
It was the ninth round of the main
evont, a scheduled 12-round bout be
tween Denver Jack Geyer and Texas
Tate.
Went Through the Ropes.
The bout had been very tame up to
that stage. Then a mixup occurred in
deyer's corner and both heavyweights
fell over the ropes and down upon the
floor. So close was their embrace
they laid there for almost a minute
while spectators tried to pry them
loose to enable them to get back in
the ring.
Tate was on the bottom and he was
hauled up and into the ring by one
arm. The pulling and hauling dislo
cated his shoulder and when the two
men were again in the ring Tate re
mained on tho floor, twisting his
hju.Jer in an effort to get it back in
place.
Instead of halting the contest to
find out the extent of Tate's injuries,
Kid Hart, the referee, listened to ad
vice from certain loud-mouthed per
sons at the ringside and started to
count Tate out. Geyer, too, lost his
."head and Beemed about to tackle Tate
on the floor, but Hart had the presence
of mind to push him back.
Seeing that his shoulder injury was
not being considered, Tate arose at
the count of four and 'Geyer sped to
the attack. They mixed just as tha
bell rang but Geyer, intent upon a
winning, hit Tate one more blow as lit
turned to go to his corner.
This infuriated the Texas boy and
he went at Geyer hammer and tongs.
A free-for-all, which proved to be the
best part of the bout, then ensued
while the referets, spectators, seconds
and managers of the two fighters
strove to separate them. Somebody
told the referee it was no contest and
he promptly cried out: "No contest."
Another told him Geyer had won on a
foul and Hart just as promptly raced to
Ceyer'8 corner and held up his arm in
token of victory.
Should Have Kept On.
He was wrong In both instances. If
anybody committed the foul upon
which the referee based tils' decision
that one boxer haA struck the other
after the bell -then it was Geyer who
committed the breach and Tate should
have had the decision.
Others alleged that Tate had quit.
There is absolutely no grouuds to ac
cuse Texas Tate of that. In the first
place when two heavy men fall six feet
to a hard floor, there is a strong possi
bility that they may be injured. In
tho second place, Tate showed his wil
lingness to fight when he tore into
Geyer hammer and tongs, go-as-you-

GAULT ON
WARPATH
RED HOT
Falls Down on State Cotton Report and
Some Federal Compiler is Likely
to Lose His Job
By United Press.
Oklahoma City, Dec. 18. President
Frank M. Gault is on the war path,
and someone is going to lost his scalp.
Gault isn't saying who the victim or
victims will be, but suspicion points
its finger to federal officials who
have to do with collecting and compil
ing figures for the cotton crop reports
In Oklahoma. It was all brought
about by the difference of 278,819
bales between the federal report for
cotton ginned in the state, and the
state report put out by Gault. On the
day the federal report was pul out, the
cotton market suffered a fall ot 8
points just because of the difference.
Gault claims his figures are abso
lutely correct. He makes his compila
tion from the individual reports made
by the ginners of the state. Those
reports are made to the board ot agri
culture with a penalty of $250 if they
are not sent in on time and sent in
correct. A vigorous investigation is
now under way by agents of the agri
culture board to find out who whs re
sponsible for the alleged "padding" of
iho federal report. "It looks premed
itated t me," declared Gault to the
United Press. "What the producer
wants is an honest report, and that's
what I gave out."
Gault took up the question wltn the
federal authorities as soon as the dif
ference was noted and ho received a
reply stating that the matter had been
referred to the division of manufac
turers, bureau of census, department
of commerce, which collects cotton
statistics. "That means it's been put
in the ice box," concluded Gault.
Gault today is trying to determine
upon what basis the federal represen
tatives determine their figures.

BIG RALLY
FOR COUNTY
SCHOOLS
Slate-wide Campaign to be Organized by
State Superintendent Wilson
for Bet:er Schools
WILSON SCORES TARDY
SUPERINTENDENTS
Weeks ot Boosting in which Doctors,
Lawyers, Newspaper Men and
Others will Take Part
Better schools for Grady county;
better schools for Oklahoma!
That Is the veiled slogan embodied
In a letter which has just been ad
dressed by State Superintendent R. H.
Wilson to all county superintendents
of public schools In the state of Okla
homa In arousing them to action and
to lively participation in a state-wide
rally in educational circles for the first
week In April. Mr. Wilson says;
Dear County Superintendent:
You will recall that a year ago we
conducted a statewide rally for bet
ter schools. In our judgment it was
a great success, notwithstanding a
number of the county superintendents
took but little part, if any, and in
some sections the teachers generally
did not understand what was being
attempted, due to the luck of organi
zation. This year, you will recall, we
wrote every county superintendent a
letter re'f iest.ing au outline ' f work
to be emphasized throughout the year. "
Thirty-two superintendents have re
ported their plans, giving them in de
tail, and forty-five superintendents, so
far as the records show, are planning
nothing to Improve their schools. Can
didly speaking, this lack of emphasiz
ing definite progressive policies is the
reason why the county superintend
ent's office has never been recognized
more than it is today and because of
this the rural school and the rural
school teachers receive so little consid
eration. At tho recent meeting ot tli Okla
homa Educational association a reso-
I lution was adopted by unanimous vote
urging this department to conduct a
state-wide campaign. We were not
aware that the resolution would be
presented t(J the association, so it
came as a very agreeable surprise to
us. However, we are always willing
and glad Jo abide by the will ot the
teachers of this state especially the
active ones. We have decided to have
thiN state-wide rally during the first
week; of April. In order that it may
be a complete success it will be nec
essary for every county superintend
ent to organize his county fully and
completely. Begin now to secure
speakers and try to arrange for
enough speakers so as to have some
one speak twice if pcvbte In every
school house during the week on the
subject of .ways and means to secure
better schools. The lawyers, doctors,
ministers, city superintendents and
newspaper men should all be invited.
I lnye asked Dr. E. X. Collette. as
sistant state superintendent, and Mr.
E. A. Duke, rural school supervisor, to
suggest a program and collect certain
information concerning the amount ot
money spout in rural schools, the re
sults obtained and other information
which they may be able to secure for
use in comparing the profession of
teaching with other professions, in
comparing the rural schools with oth
er industries, in showing the need ot
better rural schools and better rural
libraries; and in emphasizing the com
mercial value of education to the far
mer, to the mechanic, and to the busi
ness man as well as to the profession
si man. When this bulletin Is prepar
ed we will furnii-h you sufficient
copies to supply all of your speakers
and all other interested.
Please give this careful considera
tion, talk it over with, your business
men. your commercial clubs and espe
cially the newspaper men and find out
