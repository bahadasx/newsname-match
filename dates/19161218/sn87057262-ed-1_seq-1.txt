The -warning was called forth by

"A great many of us believe we
have lived for year's in a fool's para

PEACE OFFER
IS
Nothing Can be Done Unless
Belgium and Serbia Are
Restored by Their
Victors.
GOVERNMENT OUTLINE
America Thinks All the World Wants
Peace, But There May be
Some Trouble in
Getting It.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.—United
States officials are convinced today
there can be no formal discussion of
peace until Germany and Austria avow
their willingness to restore Belgium
and Serbia and until all nations in
volved pre ready to disarm on a rather
large scale.
In his forthcoming speech, Premier
Lloyd-George of England Is expected
to insist on such trffms as a funda
mental ground work for any formal
parleys and such action on his part
•would serve to pass the "buck" back
to Germany.
Moreover, officials believe he will
outline fully what the allies are fight
ing for, but In no circumstances will
ihe voice a scornful or flat rejection of
Jthe German offers.
The United Press Is in position
today to give a detailed outline of this
government's convictions on the sev
eral angles of peace developments.
They ar^, It Is believed that Ger
many offered peace because her peo
ple were becoming restless.
It Is believed the people of all
countries want peace—American In
cluded—so long as there Is no sacri
fice of the principles for which the
fighting has been going on. This gov
ernment is convinced there can be no
formal discussion of peace unless such
discussion carries an avowed willing
ness by Germany and Austria to re
store Belgium and Serbia. There can
be no peace without assurances of dis
armament on a large scale in all coun
tries with some plan for an alliance or
nations to prevent further wars.
No reason is seen why Lloyd-George,
when he addresses the commons,
should fail to outline the general
peace terms of the allies.
Unequivocal rejection of the Teu
ton proffer would Immediately react
to England's disadvantage In neutral
countries. It Is believed. It would also
result In embittering the German peo
ple to the point where they would
unite more solidly than ever behind
a government, the form of which En
gland desires to destroy. The German
people would then be convinced their•
was a war for existence ant} would
favor Its ruthless and unrestricted
pursuit.
As a result of these convictions,
this government. believes Lloyd
George may bay what England and
her allies regard as necessary to
make peace possible. Should he do
this, the belief is strong Germany
might be forced by her dwn people
to acquiesce to such terms as do not
(threaten her existence.
On the other hand, should the
premier stand by his recent
declaration that the war must go on
"to a knock out," little hope of peace
is seen and every possibility of grave
danger to this country's friendly re
lations with the teutonic powers.
Eaas are Getting Cheaper.

CHEYENNE, Wyo., Dec. 18.—Roy
A. White, Delta, California, his wife
and three sons, one of the latter a
nine months old baby, were burned in
a fire which destroyed the Inter Ocean
hotel here early today. A fourth son
of White's is still missipg and his
body is undoubtedly in the ruins.
The White family was trapped on/
the upper floor of the burning build
ing and White, who had become sep
arated from the rest of the family in
some way, became panic stricken and
jumped from a window. He fell on
live wires and was electrocuted, his
body burning for ten minutes before
it wi^s dislodged. The bodies of Mrs.
White and two of the children were
found in the debris after the lire was
extinguished.
William Sedmore, 19 year old ele
vator pilot, heroically stayed at his
post, rescuing the guests. Sedmore
ran the levator until the controlling
lever burned in his hand. He rescued
the youngest White child, but it died
from burns later. The White family
had been to Chariton, Iowa to bury
White's father and stopped here to
visit, enroute home. They had been
in the hotel less than a half hour
when the fire started. The Are orig
inated in defective wiring under the
roof of the three story hotel and
quickly spread to the entire upper
floor, cuiting off the escape of a
dozen guests. All were rescued ex
cept the White family.
The property damage is estimated
at $50,000. The hotel building had
been recently condemned and was be
ing rebuilt.
Fire also simultaneously destroyed
the Union Pacific paint shop half a
mile distant, with a loss of $150,000.

Peace.
WORRIED OVER REVENUE
Government Finds It Difficult to Raiae
Money These Days,
For Big Ap
propriations.
[By (Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. Two
score newspaper men blazed away to
day at President Wilson with inter
rogations of every governmental topic
when he met them the first time In
more than a year for formal confer
ence in his executive office.
The president opened up by bang
ing the lid down on any peace talk.
He let it be known the subject would
be regarded as a sacred one and
nothing should be said or done,that
might be misconstrued or that might
arouse speculation as to this govern
ment's possible course In the closing
scenes of the war.
It was generally believed by those
who attended the conference, that
the United States Is now doing noth
ing—j.ust awaiting what may follow
receipt of the German proposal by al
lied governments.
For thirty minutes, the president
touched on topics from universal
training to the tariff.
He let It be known that his attitude
on universal training is dependent
entirely upon the plan which might
be presented.
The essential thing in his mind is
how to work out such an institution.
It is not believed the Chamberlain
bill covers all necessary grounds and
in the meantime the federalized mili
tia plan has not been thoroughly
enough tried out to convince the
president that it is either a failure or
a success.
The government is now culling
over suggestions from General Car
ranza, made before the Mexican Amer
can peace commission, meeting at
Philadelphia today.
The president let It be known he
expects his recommendations to con
gress regarding clearing up the rail
way legislation, to go through. An
extra session will be necessary only
in casrf such amount of the recom
mendation he omitted to make the
program worthless.
Any compromises which may he
affected between the brotherhoods
and the railway managers, will not
change the president's (attitude to
wards the legislation he has recom
mended.

voting much attention to means for
