Representative Adamson says the
result of the presidential election;
made the employers more eager for
peace than they were last fall, and
that the growing belief that the presi
dent stands for a compulsory arbitra
tion law has put the brotherhood
leaders in a conciliatory frame of
mind.
Belief Is current In congressional
circles that the foremost feature of
the final agreement will be an Inter
pretation of the Adamson law so
satisfactory to both sides that the
suit to test the act's constitutionality
now before the supreme court may
be withdrawn. A plan for the Inves
tigation of threatened striken also Is
expected to result from the delibera
tions. Labor is determined that no
compulsory arbitration law shall go
on the statute books, but realizing
that the president determined to pre
vent a strike crisis, without investi
gation, they will exert every effort
to draft a compromise plan that will
have his endorsement.

NEW YORK, Dec. 18. After ex
haustlve tests the use of radium as
a cure for cancer and tumors has
been found to be a failure, according
to the annual report of Dr. Francis
Carter Wood, head of the Crocker's
cancer research fund of Columbia,
university. For cases on which op
eration Is not possible, radium la suc
cessful as a palliative only, the re
port states.
"It ia unquestionably possible to
prolong life in a few instances," Dr.
Wood says, "and to make the pa
tients more comfortable by the em
ployment of large quantities of ra
dium. On the other band, it ia
equally certain that the use of small
quantities, say. 20 to 25 milligrams
of radium element, often results in
extension of the tumor, so that the
patient's condition is worse than if
he had been left alone."

Mr. Walcott suggested that a fund

NEW YORK. Dec. 18. The Braill-
ian bark Nethtis, with twelve men
on board, was lost during the snow
storm Friday night oft Barnegat, on
the New Jersey coast, according to
Captain Moras of the tug Garibaldi,
which arrived here late yesterday.
The Nethtis was a tow of the Gari
baldi on her way here from Maran
ham, Brazil.
The bark was lost, according to
Captain Mooroea through the break
ing of the chain tackle to which the
tow line was fastened. This occurred
shortly before 7 p. m., and for seven
hours the tug searched through the
blinding storm for some trace of her
tow, repeatedly sounding her whistle
and burning lights.
The quest was unavailing, however,
and at daylight Saturday the tug
came on to New York to report the
loss.
The Garibaldi, with her tow, start
ed from Maranham, October 13,
touching at Barbadoes and San Juan
for coal and suplles. Less than 60
miles of her six thousand mile voy
age remained to be covered when
the bark was lost. On three previous
occasions, the captain said, the tow
line parted, but the tug always man
aged to pick up the bark again.
