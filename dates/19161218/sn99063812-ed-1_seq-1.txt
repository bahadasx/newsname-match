Rabbit Poisoning Takes
Attention of Sportsmen
To discuss tho campaign for eradi
cation of jack rabbits by poisoning,
I, r..i inhnnnn. nresideilt of the
Klamath Sportsmen's Association, has
called a meeting for this evening at 8
o'clocw at the Commercial Clubrooms.
The meeting grows out of an an
nouncement by H. U. Glalsyer, county
agricultural agent, that poisoned grain

poisoning was to bo carried on by the

RELIGIOUS SURVEY SHOWS PREF

Populatron It Estimated" at 4,000 by
Worker of Churches and Christian
People of This Number Are Found
to Total 2,216, with Eighteen Dif
ferent Denominations Represented
....in the Survey.
There has recently been completed
in this city a general survey of reli
gious conditions. It was conducted
under the auspices of the various
church organizations, the work being
done by a corps of twenty-five work
ers. Some of the results of their in
vestigations appear in the following
tabulatien:
No. families visited 710
No. individuals in these families 2215
Aver, number persons in family 3
These persons are distributed among
the various churches as follows; .
Church

643 2216
It will be seen from these facts
that there are represented in this city
eighteen different denominations or
sects of religion. Of those who are
reported above as having no church
preference whatever, 443 of them are
over 18 years of age and 324 of them
under that age. -The number of the
families in which the husband is a
member of a church but not the wife
is 27; where the wife is a member
and not the husband is 148; where
both are members is 159, and where
enither are members is 295. A care
ful study of all available information
revealed at least 300 families that had
been omitted for one reason or an
other from the above record and al
lowed a margin of 400 more families,
of which no knowledge was. obtained
by the visitors, there would appear
to be a the same ratio as found in each
family a total of about 1800 more peo
ple In the city (including Pelican City
and Shipplngton), or a total present
population of about 4000 people. Us
ing thl as a basis for comparison,
the report revealed the fact that the
piesent church membership of the city
as reported on the church rolls of the
city would be about 15.3 per cent of
the Protestant churches and another
15.2 per cent Included In the Episco
palian, Catholic and Christian Science
organizations.
The survey revealed the fact that
about 30 per cent of those who wero
repoited as belonging to one or the
other of the churches which maintain
organizations hero do not appear on
the record, of these organizations, but
must hold their connections in some
other city.
It was discovered that of those vis
ited. the Protestant constituency com
prised 21.2 per cent and the church
constituency not ordinarily classified
as Protestant comprised 15.3 per cent.
If this same percentage were applied
to the entire population of the city
there ought to appear on the records
of tho various churches a much larger
membership than actually does .ap
pear. One fit the purposes of the or
ganizations conducting this study ot
conditions was to discover if possible
Militiamen Charge
Neglect on Border
why this was so and to seek some ade-1
quate remedy for the situation.
The matter of Sunday school en
rollment was also given some consid
eration. A careful examination of the
recent school census, which contains
1108 names, and a comparison with
the Sunday school enrollments ot the
various churches, reveals the fact 785
children of school age are not in at
tendance upon any Sunday school or
ganization. A study of church attendance also
accompanies the report of the survey,
and is here given for Sunday, Decem
ber 10, 1916:
Church S.S. A.M. Y.P. P.M.
Presbyterian .... 78 58 11 34
Disciples 97 65 20 51
Em. Baptist 62 16 16 26
Methodist 97 72 33 65
First Baptist.... 34 30
368 241 80 176
A similar comparison made on Jan
uary 30, 1916, revealed the totals, as
outlined above to be Sunday school,
'M: morning preaching service; 241;
lounsuMOOle's meeting In the even-
ing, 77, and evening preaching aerv-
IcerzOS.-- - -- "-
The church buildings In the city are
entirely Inadequate to do efficient,
modern church work. The Emmanuel
Baptist organization Is now erecting a
building" which will be used tempo
rarily for church services and later
will be made into a borne for the min
ister. The Presbyterian organization
is preparing plans for the erection of
a new building on their present prop
erty just as soon as the Ankeny ditch
has been formally, closed, making it
possible to properly locate the build
ing. They are expecting to use their
old building for a gymnasium and in
the new building to make ample pro
vision for the social life and activi
ties of a large constituency.
Any such a study as this has to take
into consideration other agencies
which are meeting the social and other
needs' of the community, but It bas
not recorded facts sufficiently definite
for present publication.
