Vatican Believes Mediation Is

National Aspirations Must Be
Satisfied,
ROMF., Drr. 18 -Pope Benedict has
no intention of attempting to mediate
among the bcllierents at present, ac
cording to a statement issued today by
the Vatican. The statements lay that
neither tlir pope nor ilic holy ire havr
QaIc or wih to make any comment
warding Germany' peace proposals
ami that tlirretnre
any announce

that the pope nat
urally hat an ar
dent desire for
peace, hut that he
doe not helieve
that any interven
tion at the present
moment would hasten its' conclusion.
The net result of everal resolutions
introduced in the chamber of deputies
regarding the Orman peace offer and
I prolonged discussion among the
senators and deputies was the derision
by the legislators that no peaco would
be accepted unless in accordance with
national aspirations and the rights of
peoples' based on the principle of na
tionality. If such a peace is impossi
ble to obtain diplomatically, it was
declared that it must be obtained by

Socialists Urge
Peace Discussion
PARIS, Dec. 18-The tocialist fed
eration of the Paris diitrict hai adopt
ed a resolution giving favorable con
sideration to the possible resumption
of international socialist relations. The
resolution emphasizes the possibility of
these relations having reference to
peace on the condition that clear
proposals in definite terms be sub
mitted by Germany and her allies.
The entente governments are invited
in the resolution not to reject any peace
proposals without serious consideration
and to submit such proposals to the
respective parliaments.
It is pointed out that the more the
central jiowers' peace proposals are
unacceptable the more it is the duty
of the allies to denounce them to the
world.

I'lllLADKLriUA. Dec. 18-Indica-tions
at the close of the morning ses
sion of the Mexican-American commis
sion were that General Carranta was
not disposed to close the door against
an aKreement with the American rep
resentatives, who have been trying for
more than three months to solve ities
tions at issue between Mexico and the
I'nited States. When the commission
re-convened today after a three-weeks'
recess, Alberto J. l'atii, Mexican com
missioner reported the results of his
visit to Queretaro. The report was
made verbally and was received by the
Americans without comment. An ad
journment until later in the day was
taken, when, it is expected the details
of his written message from Mexico
will be discussed.
Mar Be Ratified.
The exact character of his report was
nbt revealed, but it was learned that,
while Carranza bad not signed the
protocol drafted at Atlantic City, this
was not necessarily to be taken as an
indication that it would not be rati
fied later, the signature perhaps being
that of Ambassador-Designate Arre

to sign such a document.

Not More Than Three May
Now Be Served,
LONDON, Dec. 18 -The first food
restriction went into force in Fngland
today. Hotels ami restaurants arc now
forbidden to serve more than two
rourses for breakfast or luncheon and
three rourses for dinner.
Little inconvenience was experienced
in connection with the two first meals.
The Knglishrnan's usual breakfast con
sists of a cereal and bacon and eggs or
fish except in the more expensive
places a luncheon of two courses is the
rule. U was in arranging for a dinner
of three courses that the caterers ex
perienced the greatest difficulties but
even in this case few are likely to go
hungry as hors d'ouvrs and soup cost
only half fare and two-course dinners
have the choice of fish, entree!, or
roasts with vegetable desserts. Cheese
with bread and butter or crackers ii
counted as a course.
The meatless day to follow shortly
will prove more difficult problem for
restaurants which make a specialty ot
roasts.

FREEUNG TO DRAW BILL
Counties Do Not Get Their
Share, Another Objection,
Repeal of the act of the V)5 legis
lature, levying a 2 percent tax on the
gross reieipts of express and telegraph
companies is asked in a resolution
adopted by the state board of equaliza
tion this morning.
Attorney deneral S P. Freelmg,
member of the hoard, was requested
to prepare the bill for the repeal of thr
law. and have it introduced in the
forthcoming legislature
Law a Failure.
Members of the lioard de lared the
law has been a complete failure. It is
almost impossible for the companies, it
was stated, to make complete reports
under its provisions. Members of the
board say that if the state would cm
ploy the corps of experts necessary to
keep check on the companies and see
that the law was complied with it
would cost the state almost as much as
the tax would yield.
Another objection to the law is the
fact that all taxes collected under its
provisions go direct to the state, and
the counties in which the companies
subject to the law operate, get none of
the taxes.
Report! Accepted.
The board this morning accepted the
reports of the Westerri I'nion, Markay
and Postal telegraph companies of their
gross receipts for the year of 1915. Ac
cording to these reports the Western
Union will pay the state $21 455.07 ;
the Postal will pav $oo2.11 and the
Mackay will pay $lrV278. This is in
lieu of all other taxes on these com
panies. Teamster Takes
