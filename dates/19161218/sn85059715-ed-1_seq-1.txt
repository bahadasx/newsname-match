PARIS. Dec. 18.?The Roumanian I
army is nov; safe, according to news
received in Paris Sunday night, says
the Petit Parisien. The paper says
that the survivors are now beyond the
Sereth river at Jassy and in Bessarabia
where they are being regrouped
and refitted in view of further opera-:
t.ions. The entire Roumanian front!
is now stated to be held by the Rus- j
sians alone.
After the Miiohnrest-Rlneehti line
was lost., the story says, the Russians:
sent divisions and forces of cavalry |
to support the retreat of the Rouraan- j
ian army. King Ferdinand fell back j
as rapidly as posr'ble. assured of the,
possibility of re-forming behind the j
shelter of the Russians, and con-1
tinued the withdrawal without halt-j
ing until the Sereth was crossed.
The Russians offered strong re-,
sistance to the Germans in the region
of Buzeu so as to permit engineers
to construct a defensive front between
Rirnnik Karat and the Danube
marshes, on which front, it is stated,
the Russians intend to stop tbo advance
of the invaders.

( v associates psisc)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.?Major
General Scott, chief of staff of the
array, told the Senate military committee
Monday that the army general
staff recommended without apology
the volunteer system be1 discarded
"because the time has come when
this country must resort to universal
liability to military training and service
unless it intends to avoid war at
any cost."
Arraigning the volunteer system as
extravagant and dangerous the
chief of staff told the committee
that universal training would be democratic,
reliable, efficient and economical,
and within a few years practically

"It would be democratic," he said,
"because the burden of national defense
would fall equally upon all citizens.
It would make It impossible
for any man or group of men to trade
upon the nation's necessities in time
of war. The system would be reliable
because it would produce each
year the number of men necessary to
be trained. It would be economical
because it would be based upon recognition

the individual to render personal service
and in carrying it into effect the
government would not have to compete
in the labor market. It would
be efficient because it would enable
us to prepare adequately for war
before war comes."
At tho outset General Scott pointed
out that the Mexican crisis had failed
to recruit many national guard organizations
even to their minimum peace
strength.
"The failure should make the people
realize that the volunteer system does
not and probably will not give us
cither the men we need in peace or for
service in war," he said.
"While a war waged against us by
an alliance may in the future be a
possibility it Is not a probability and
it is believed that if we provide an
adequate army to defend the country
against any Bingle nation the probability
of a war between the United
States and a\ coalition of powers
would grow even more remote.
"The system is Inefficient." he said,'
"because under it we must wait fori
war to come before preparing our defense.
We must wait for an emergency
before beginning to raise, train and
equip the vast armies which war with
any first class power or coalition
would render necessary.' A nation
that is so short-sighted with respect
to its man power cannot be expected
to look far into the future with respect
to rrmnitirm* SUnDliea.**

Plans are being perfected for the c

been with a spirit of good cheer and t
:o-operatlon that people have entereu 1
into the work of securing the neces- <
sary parts to make it successful. As l
It is to bo a real community tree, 1
everything for the tree will be donated,
and what is lacking in funds will 1
?nrelv he mnfle nr? hv the nnhltr* Rnir- i
ited people of the city. At first the 1
finding of a tree large enough to place i
in the court bouse square Bcemed to 1
he the great problem. But at just the <
right moment the sheriff offered to get c
Lhe tree and place it in the right spot i
ready for the celebrations. i
Then the superintendent of music in
the public schools offered to lead the j
children in a program or music to cele- <
brate the first lighting of the tree. This
will be a great occasion when Friday i
evening, after school the children Trom i
the schools will come to the tree and 5
3ing praises for the Savior of the world
and also for the country In which we
enjoy freedom. It is hoped also to
have the Stealey boys band some time
during the early evening.
Saturday evening when everyone is
busy doing the last bit of the Christ- .
mas shopping, and when it may seem I
to many that the holiday is only for
the buying of gifts for others, it is
hoped to have Gregory's band to fill
the air with the strains of the old
Christmas carols. Saturday evening
will hp thn timA whon ovr>rv nnr? m?V 1
have an opportunity to share in the <
giving of gifts for those who are not i
on their o,wn lists?that is to , bring i
gifts of clothing, of staples,' of candy, !
and of toys, and in fact everything that 1
might he used by another, and at the
tree will be a committee to receive the i
gifts and it will then " find just the <
right person to whom the ~ifts may be 1
given. It is hoped that this night will t
be a great night for giving, and will <
therefore be the happiest one.
Sunday evening will be the night for
singing. The Choral Club will lead ]
in- the singing of some of the Christmas
|carols, and every one present
will join in the music. This service
will be at 6:30 o'clock, at the time
of the young people's meetings at the
churches: so, it may be a big meeting
of aM the young and older people of
the city for the celebration of the coming
of Christ. This service is to be
the real Christmas service for the
comhiunity as it will be Christmas eve,
when the best time for the appreciation
of the thought of Christmas will be
near. Every person will enjoy the
service on Sunday evening at 6:30.
Monday evening it Is hoped to have {
the Italian band to furnish music and
the Camp Fire Girls to give several
tableaux showing scones of the Nativity.
This will be a great evening
for the children and those who want
to get some real good enjoyment from
the celebration at the tree.
Other programs for the.tree have not
been ..definitely arranged. 'On one evening
during the week children from the
Water street school will ./furnish :a
musical program, and from several
of-.the churches. This program, is being

HOLIDAYS
Are Making Business at the
Various Hotels in the City
Rather Quiet.
As usual at thl's season of the year,
the holiday quiet prevails at the local
hotels as well as at most of the
other hotels of the country with the
possible exception of those in the
southern winter resorts, and it is expected
to continue until after- the J
New Year.
For the last few days there has (
been a rush of business at the local
hotels on account of the large number
of people who arc enroute to their
homes or are going to some distant
point where they will spend a portion
of the holiday season with relatives
or friends and stop off here .
for a brief rest or to change trains.
However, the slump in business at
the hotels started Saturday night
and from this time forward, until
probably ten days after the New Year,
there will be little business. Many
of the traveling men have gone into
headquarters for the year end and
will not be out until about the middle
of next month and this also tends
to cut down the business.
