Frankfort on Friday sustained the
judgment of the Mason Circuit Court
In sentencing Uarry Hcnakcr of Cyn
thlana to the penitentiary for arson
He will receive a sentenco from the

nil probability and will then bo tnken
to the state prison at Frankfort. Since
his trial during tho September term of
tho lower court he has bpen con line
In the Mason county jail.
Slnco tho Commonwealth secured
conviction of Benakcr In tho fall his
bi other of Cynthlana has been busy In
this city and county circulating a pctl
Hon asking different citizens to sign
the same. This petition asks that
Governor Stanley pardon Hcnakcraud
It will probably bo presented to hi

Appeals has sustained the judgment
of the lower court.
Henaker's crime, that of arson, was
a most serious one and tho Common
wealth made every effort to convict
him. He was represented by Hon. A
D. Cole of this city, who has left no
stone unturned in his attempt to clear
his client. During tho September
term of court Mr. Cole asked for
now trial and upon this being refused
asked for a stay of sentenco and an
