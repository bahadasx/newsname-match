ents of Zela Sprung in
I PirstSMnnian, '
, Fred Heracc, and Ids 13 year ', old
,iirl bride, Zela Sprang, apparently
' Iiave emerged triumphsunt from their

cthe Bridgeport and New York police,

the Tomb prison In New York, last
;week in bonds, of $1,000 and is living
biappily "with his wife at the "home of
2Hrs. a W. Hoffm aster, 87 Smith St.
This morning he returned to the
position at the Lake Torpedo Boat
whAcli he held previous to arrest
n- charges of abduction and another
btIous offence, and intends to live in
JJridgeport happy 4,ever afterwards."
UV less- the girl is brought back to
JCew York' he carmpt be convicted of
the ' offences charged against him.
; The Bridgeport police however are
till waiting for her to appear on the
streets She refuses to' emerge from
the sheltering arms of Mrs. Hoff mas
ter and the fact that she: is staying
within doors has balked the t police
in their efforts to lay hands on her.
- If the authorities once get posses
sion of the girl they wilt arrest her
oh charges of incorrigibility and 're
turn her to her mother in New. York.
Her .' parents will then force her ' to
testify in court against her husband,
en action whicb. she had thus far
steadfastly refused to take. xReucco's
; father j who, it is said, runs a chain
of barber shops in New York, refused
. at first to aid his son in any way.
Last week however, he relented and
after talking with his boy in the
Tombs furnished bail for him .
Reucco's father was oppdsed to the
match for the same reasons as the
girl's parents, who are English sub
jects, namely that the girl was of
different race and religion. The
Sprung girl Is a Jewess. Reucco views
his arrest as a danger that has passed.
The police however hold a different
opinion. . "Wait until we get hold of

Premier Lloyd George's speech in
the house of Commons on Tuesday is
expected to show the general attitude
of the British government. It is un
derstood the assertion made, in the
German note that the war was forced
upon Germany will not be permitted
to go unchallenged.

as Germany's methods of conducting
war against a " civilian population,

the recent Belgian deportations, also
is likely to be pointed out Accord

along has held strongly to the opinion
that the German peace proposal should
receive a serious reply, commenting
today on the statement that the note

TWO HURT WHEN
MACHINES MEET
AT SHARP TURN
Glass From Windshield Cuts
Women in Smash-Up at
Fairfield.
(Special to The Farmer.)
Fairfield, Dec. 18 Two x automo
biles came together with a crash at
Benson's Corner about 6 o'clock last
evening, and as, a result two persons
have severe injuries.
An automobile driven by a man
who gave hie name as Howard Broth
ers of 297 State street, containing his
brother, Charles, according to their
report to the Fairfield police author!-;
ties, and Mary and Ida Leonard of
1606 Barnujji avenue, was struck by
a limousine operated by Fred Lalley
of 1015 Fairfield avenue. Nobody
was thrown out of the cars but the
occupants of the Brothers machine
were cut by glass from - the .wind
shield. The girl who gave her name to Dr.
Dr. W. T. Nagle, to whose office the
injured were removed, as Mary Leon
ard, suffered a gash over one eye
that will leave a large scar. Her girl
companion suffered a laceration of
her right - knee. Charles Brothers'
law was severely cut and much glass
lodged in it.
They were taken to a house nearby,
where first aid treatment was given
and later removed to the office of Dr.
Nagle.
Besides the driver those in the
Lalley car gave their names as a
Miss Haggerty she wouldn't say
Where she lived a Mr. Lionne of
Connecticut avenue and N. Keane of
368 Fairfield avenue. There must be
some mistake somewhere, the Fair-
l,d authorities believe, because the
Lalley address is the only one of all
they got that jibes with the names
given, after a consultation of the di
rectory. The Brothers party told Dr. Nagle,
and Dr. J. H. Beaudry, who assisted
him, that their car was standing
when hit, and that the Lalley car,
coming from behind a trolley, skidded
and ran into theix machine

CANADIAN CAPITAL HERE FOR
DEVELOPMENT PURPOSE, DIG
STRATFIELD ESTATE IS SOLD
The impending consummation of
the largest realty, deal of the season
which is to fnclude some of the oldest
properties in the community of Strat
field reveals the fact that as a result
of the European war, Canadian .finan
ciers have been 'compelled to throw
enormous sums of money into United
States realty, and that Bridgeport has
been, selected as one of the most
promising fields -for investment.
Negotiations practically were closed
today for the purchase of nearly 85
acres of land between the East turn
pike and what is known as Church
Hill- road, now owned by Zalmon
Goodsell, and the adjoining: tract
known as the : Brothwell ; estate. The
estimated price is approximately
$180,000, a valuation of. more than
$2,000 an acre.
The intending purchasers are The
Robins Co., Inc., said to number
among their officers and directors
some of the wealthiest capitalists - Of
Canada and the United States, who
within the last two years have ac
quired the great River'cliff estate, the
Savoy Gardens, Madison Heights park
and Waverly. park, the whole com
prising more, than 400 acres In
Bridgeport, Fairfield and - Milford.
The monetary investment , already
made by the company in this city is
said to be more than a million and a
half dollars within two years. ,
At the offices of the Robins Co. it
was asserted todday that tentative ne
gotiations for the purchase of the two.
tracts in? Stratfield had been practi
cally concluded. Zalmon Goodsell
admitted that options had been taken

SHAW AIMS TO
SAVE THE DEER
OF CONNECTICUT
Thousands Killed in Last
Two Years Extermina
tion is Threatened
Representative Samuel C. Shaw, of
Redding, will present to the General
Assembly immediately on its-convening
next month, a bill to restore the
-closed season on deer. According to
Mr. Shaw, he has been informed by
veteran hunters that such a measure
alone can prevent the complete ex
termination of deer.
During the ast two years, thou
sands of deer have been killed. ' The
last legislature passed a- lair 'per
mitting the "shooting of deer under
the following conditions: .
"The owner of real estate, or
the lessee of land leased for agri
, cultural purposes for a period of
not less than one year, or any
member of his" family or bona
fide employee, with the permis
sion of such owner or lessee, may
kill with a shotgun or capture
any deer, buck, doe, or fawn, on '
land owned or so leased by him,
provided this act shall not be
" construed to permit any person
to set or use a salt lick, or cap
ture, take or attempt to take any
deer, buck, doe,, or fawn, by
means of any trap, snare, or de
vice. Any deer killed or taken
pursuant to the provisions of this
act shall be the property of the
. owner or lessee of the land upon
which the same was killed or
taken, provided the person who
shall kill or take such deer shall,
. within twenty-four hours there
after, report the same to the
commissioners of fisheries and
game.
Mr. Shaw says that hunters in Red
ding and vicinity believe the re
strictive law should be put in opera
tion again, else deer will be entirely
exterminated.
Another measure to be presented
by Mr. Shaw will seek to regulate the
bond required of deputy sheriffs. Aft
present the size of the bond "is op
tional with the high sheriffs in the
various counties. The high sheriff is
bonded in favor of the county, while
the deputies are bonded in favor of
the sheriff. In some cases, says Mr.
Shaw, deputies are required to give
bonds as high as $10,000. This works
a . hardship, the deputies maintain,
and they seek relief. They ask either
a lower uniform bond, if the higher
surety is desired, that the county as
sume the premium.' -
the announcement last summer that
Jordon & Selleck, with John Casey,
the attorney, had purchased a large
section . of the Nathaniel Wordin es
tate, which was cut up into building
lots and disposed of quickly, realty
men awoke to the fact that Bridge
port's boom had extended beyond the
city bounds.
4 The Robins Co., operating under the
name of the Rivercliff Realty Co., had
heretofore confined its efforts in an
opposite direction. Their accession
to this section came as a great sur
prise last Saturday, when rumors of
the purchase became broadcast.
The officials stated without reserve
that Canadian capital, whose interests
in Canada had been tied up by the
war, necessarily sought a neutral
country in which to keep their re
serve cash in circulation
With this aim in view agents had
been sent . broadcast over the United
States to-observe conditions. Bridge
port, as a munition center, had been
largely advertised in Canada. - A sur
veV of the field here showed that no
other city, seemed likely to have such
immediate and rapid growth as , this
city. . The need of housing was ap
parent. The fact that this housing
necessity, would hot be required alone
ror the "working classes, but that a
great demand would be made for the
higher class of dwelling at once ap
pealed to Toronto -financiers. ,The
result has been that Canadians as
well as the wealthy Americans involv
ed in the . company have pinned their
.faith in Bridgeport already to an ex
tent -said to be larger than one and a
half minions of dollars.
' At Mh' Robins offices here it was
said tpdayThat rapid development of
I the:, properties -would be . made, early

TROLLEY SYSTEM
HAMPERED WHEN
POOR FUEL FAILS
Crowds' on ' W ay to Work
Have to Use'Legs as Pow
er Supply Gives Out.
It was just the luck of the Con
necticut Co. and its niany patrons this
morning that while the thermometer
was rapidly falling, the company
should strike a barge-load of poor
coal.
That's what caused the tie-up on
thex lines today. 'Between 6:45 and 7:30
on the' East Side and between 7:20
o'clock and 7:30 on the West Side' cars
were stalled on most of the lines. The
power failed them as they were tak
ing Bridgeporters to work, and as a
result walking became necessary if
not popular.
. The "combination of the cold snap
and the supply of poor coal that was
fed into the boilers until its character
was discovered, caused the trouble.
The, company, which buys from the
mines, has several barges of coal on
hond and- this morning, unfortunately
for it, and its patrons," the boilers
couldn't v turn out the necessary
amount of juice. '
' Clinkers . "as big as a cart" were
taken out of the boilers, according to
Manager Charles H. Chapman, and a
new iconslmment of coal was substi
tuted'. After a while traffic conditions
were normal.
Commuters coming . from Derby and
hinter parts of Stratford this morning
were stalled in the center of Stratford
at 7:30 o'clock. Onequick-wltted per
son shouted, "Me for the 7:39 train,"
and he rushed for the station." This
was the cue for others and mariy left
the stalled trolley.

Chief of Staff, Appearing in
Behalf of Senator Cham
berlain's Bill, Declares
That Volunteer System is
Worthless Jls Defensive
Force.
Million and a Half Men
Should Be Ready at First
Call, He Says, and That
Many More Within 90
Days Cites European
War As An Example.
Washington, Dec. 18 Major
General Hugh L. Scott, Chief Jof
Staff of the Army, told the Sen
ate military committee today
that the army general staff,
recommended without apology
the volunteer system be disi
carded "because the time has
come when this country, unless
it intends to avoid war 'at any ,
cost' must resort to -universal,
liability to .military training
and service." ' i rt;
Arraigning the volunteer sys
tem as extravagant, inefficient
and dangerous the chief of staff
told the committee that univeiv
sal training woulji fbe demo
cratic, reliable and economic
and' would render the United
States immune from attack:
Advocates and opponents of a sys
tem of universal training ;for military
service to - replace the volunteer sys
teni as .the mainstay of: the nation's .
defense," were to be heard, by the Sen-.
ate committee. ;. .' ' v C, . . v " .'V
Representatives of organizations op
posed .to the bill, -headed, by 'Walter
Fisher, former "secretary of. the in"
terior, gave their reasons for opposing1
universal training.-
' Mr.' Fisher declared himself in favor
of adequate preparedness.
. Maj. Gen. Scott had this to .say in
favor of Senator'. Chamberlain's plan
for universal military service':'
"It ' would ' be ' democratic" because
the burden of national defense would
fall equally on the pities. -It would
make it impossible for a New York
man or group of men to trade upon
the nations necessities in time of war.
The system would be reliable because-
it would produce each year the num
ber of men necessary ,to .be trained.
It would be economical because . It
would be based upon recognition by
the people of the duty ofT the in
dividual to render personal ' service
and in carrying it into' effect the gov
ernment would not have . to compete
in the labor market. It would be
efficient because .it would enable us to '
prepare adequately for war before it
comes." . , , ;
At the outset General Scott -pointed
out that the Mexican crisis had failed
to recruit many national guard or
ganizations even to - their minimum
peace, strength. '-:
' "The failure should make the whole
people realize that the volunteer sys
tem does not and probably will not
give us either the men we need in
peace or for service in war," he said.
Reviewing the intensive training in
which European nations require, he
declared that if American troops ever '
were to compete with highly trained
and disciplined forces they would re-
quire training and discipline at least
equal to their of their opponents. '
The lessons of the European war.
the general said, had demonstrated
that a higher standard of training and
discipline were required than was pop- .
ularly considered necessary, before anil
