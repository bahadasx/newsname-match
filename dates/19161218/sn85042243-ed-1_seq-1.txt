New York, Dec. 18.—With the re­
moval of iBaron Robert Emanuel Op­
penheim from the steamship Noer
dam to Ellis Island today, the mystery
surroundnig the detention of a reput­
ed French and English financier 'by
the immigration authorities was en­
hanced by their continued refusal to
give any reason for their action.
The Ellis Island officials said the
orders to hold Oppenheim, who arriv­
ed on the Noerdaip yesterday, came
from the bureau of immigration at
Washington, to whom all inquiries
were referred. Word came from Wash­
ington that the immigration depart­
ment knew nothing of the detention.
Oppenheim's only explanation for his
being held was that it "might be a
case of mistaken identity."
A circumstantial report was current
that Oppenheim had arrived here with
$500,000 in cash and securities.
Ordered Deported.
Baron Robert E. Pppenhcim, report­

By PATRICIA COLLINGE.
(Star of "Poliyanna," the Glad Play.)
There's no time like Christmas time
in which to begin playing the "glad
game," for it is the season of cheer.
And what's the "glad game," some­
one asks who...hasn't read about or
seen Poliyanna? It's more a state
of jpind than anything pise, vthough
there are certain rules to be fallowed
before you can really get .yourself
into that state of mind.
You must try desperately to find
something to be glad about, in every
situation that arises. It is literally
adapting to yourself the old saying
"Cheer up, it might be worse."
If you're out of a job, but have per­
fect health, be glad that you're not
like that poor unfortunate slouching
along across the street. He's out of
work, too, but he's a cripple and tuber­
cular. Cross over and give him a word
of c^eer. Give liim a real Christmas
greeting.
If you're doing fairly well, don't
let yourself be eaten up with envy
V]ien you see the bank president
rolling by in his imported limous­
ine. Be glad that you haven't got
his indigestion and that you can
take your coat off when you get
home and play with the baby in
your shirt sleeves. Yes, and eat
yoiy dinner in them, too, if you
want to. He can't, poor man.
He's got to slip into a dinner coat
and be waited on by an English
butler.
If you're going home with an armful
of packages and you slip on an icy
spot on the sidewalk and come in sud­
den and entirely unexpected contact
with the pavement, don't startle the
innocent bystanders with a line of
conversation unfit for publication and
acquire an ingrowing grouch that will
last until bed-time. Play the Glad
Game. Smile and be glad that you
didn't break Xfiur leg.
Don't make a routine of your Christ­
mas giving. Don't go through with it^
like some sort of a formal ritual. Put
joy and gladness into it. Don't keep
figuring on the stubs of your check
book how much it's costing you in
cold hard cash, don't keep consigning
the man who invented Christmas
presents to Dante's seventh hell.
Think of the gladness that you are
giving to other folk and be sure that
you are going to make some folk real-

ITALY NOT READY TO
TALK OVER TERMS
RESTORATION OF TERRITORY.
(United Press)
Washington, DeC. 18.—United
8tates officials are convinced that
there will be no peace until Bel­
gium and 8erbia are restored and
all belligerents greatly reduce
their normal armament.
The United Press here today
learned that Lloyd George, in his
speech tomorrow in the British
house of commons, is expected to
insist upon such terms as the
ground work for peace. By such
action, he would pass the buck
for continuance of the waf back
to Germany. In no sense is he
expected to refuse peace offers.
(Associated Press)
Rome, Dec. 18.—Pope Bendict has
no intention of attempting to mediate
among the belligerents at present, ac­
cording to a statement issued today at
the Vatican. The statement says
neither the pope nor the holy see has
made, or wish to make, any comment
regarding the German peace proposals
and that therefore any announcement
attributed to them is absolutely un­
founded. It is added that the pope
naturally has an ardent desire for
peace, but he does not believe any n
tervention at the present moment
would hasten Its conclusion.
The net result of several resolutions
introduced in the chamber of deputies
regarding the German peace offer, and
a prolonged discussion among sena­
tors and deputies was the decision by
the legislators that no peace would
be accepted unless in accordance with
national honor and the rights of the
people based on the principle of na­
tionality. If such peace is impossible
to obtain, diplomatically, it was de­
clared that it must be obtained by vic­
tory of arms.
