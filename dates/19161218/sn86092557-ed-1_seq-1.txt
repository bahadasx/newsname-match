'^Tells Senate Military Committee
That Volunteers
Must Go.
FOR UNIVERSAL TRAINING
[Would be Democratic, Reliable,
Efficient and Economical.
WASHINGTON. Dn IV?.Major
General Scotl. ebiet of stall of atuty.
told the senate military committee to
day that tho army general staff recommended
without apology I liar the
volunteer system bo discarded.
"Because the time has conn; when
ihis country unless it Intends to avoid
war 'at any cost' must resort to universal
liabilities lo military trulniuc
and service."
Arranging the volunteer system us

"ud lui: wxiivi ui aiau turn i uu tuiumu
tee that universal training would be
democratic-, reliable, efficient and ocon
umlcal and within a few years practically
render the I'nited States immune
from attack.
"It would be democratic." he said,
"because burden or national defense
would fall equally upon all citizens. It
would make it impossible for any man
or group of men to trade upon the nation's
necessities in time of war. The
system would be reliable because it
would produce each year the number
of men necessary to be trained.
"It would be economical hecnuac It
would be based upon recognition by
the people of the duty of the individual
to render personal service and In
carrying it into effect the government
would not have to compete in the labor
markot. It would be efficient because
. It would enable us to prepare adequately
for war before war comes."
At the outset General Scott pointed
out that the .Mexican crisis had
failed to recruit many National Guard
organizations even to their minimum
peace rank.
"The failure* should make the whole
. people realize that volunteer system
[p^does not and probably will not. give
us either men we need in peace or for
service in war." said he.
"While a war waged against us by
an alliance may in the future be a
possibility it is not a probability anil
it is believed that if wr provide an adequate
army to defend the country
against any single nation tin* probabil
ity of a war between the I'liitod States
and a coalition of powers would grow
even more remote.
"The system is inefficient." he said.

Christmas turkeys will be even higher
than the turkeys that graced the tables

say local dealers. The demand for
utrlteys at the Thanksgiving seusor. j
was sn great as to deplete the supply j
considerably more than was anticipa-1
cd and the high prices at Christmas j
are reselling.
The other lliings that, go into the
making of the Christmas dinner are)
approximately the saiuo as were quo!-i
er| for the Thanksgiving feast, except.!
perhaps, that there is a greater var-1
iety of tilings offered. Mistletoe, is
very scarce this year and considerably
difficult is hcing experienced in
getting it at all.
Of fruit cake there will he a plenty,

considerable more than a ton of the
spicy deliciotlsnoss and put it away
