pressing entire satisfaction with the

Witnesses of the shooting told repre

dispute over the two Syms' childre-i
precipitated the affair. Syms and his
wife were divorced Several months ago,
the two children having been claimed
by both father and mother at alternate
October 13, touching at Barbadoes
and San Juan for coal and sup
plies. Less than sixty miles of her
six thousand mile voyage re
mained to be covered when tho
bark was lost. On three previous
occasions, the captain said, the
tow line parted, but the tug always
managed to pick up the bark again.
The heavy weather and high gale
prevailing Friday making it im
possible to see any distance from
the tug, caused the bark to be
swept almost instantly out of sight
as soon as the tackle parted.
The Nethtis is not registered in
available shipping records. Cap
tain Moroes said, however, that
she was a vessel with three masts,
of a size that would permit her
being made into a steamer. She
was consigned to Barbar SL Com

is an additional argument, as far as
