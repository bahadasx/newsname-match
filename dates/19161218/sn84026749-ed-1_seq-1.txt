"Without Including a provision to
abolish the half-and-half plan which
has been attempted In District
budget, for several years past the
House Committee on Appropriations
reported today the District of Colum
bia appropriation bill for the fiscal
year 1018.

were cut $3,(100,000, yet the bill carries

than one hundred new employments.

No Automatic Increase.
The bill carries no automatic per
centage basis salary Increases, for all
employes of the District receiving
less than 11,800. as was provided In
the legislative, executive and Judicial
bill reported last week.
The performance, In tho House Sat-
-i "c" " Jmiea committee re
ported a special rule 'opening the sal
.r)Lq.,.",t'?n. to wholeaalo amendment,
Is believed to have "scared off" the
Appropriations Committee and pre
vented It from Inserting a percentage
basis Increase In the District budget?
Originally It was Intended to follow
the example set In the legislative bill
and Include a higher salary rider In
all the supply bills, but members of
15". Appropriations. Committee feel
that the House is showing a disposi
tion to "run away with" the salary
question and override tho committee
plan for alight Increases.
nrplua Advice Ignored.
The District bill contains no refer
ence to the recommendation of the
Commissioners that they be permitted
t apply the surplus revenues of the
District toward the payment of tho
municipal debt. In the absence of
such legislation, the surplus simply
will accumulate.
In the Kirn Department the office of
sergeant Is created, and there 'uru
salary Increases all along the line.
The fact that this Is a short session
of Congress, and there Is no time for
another squabble over the half-and-half
controversy, Is understood to
have persuaded the Appropriations
Committee not to Include a section at.
Jacking the organic law of J87N. The
half-and-half .plan apparently Is safe
for another year.
Important Illdrrs.
Legislative ''riders" of far-reaching
Importance are carried In the District
bill. Briefly,-they Include;
Creation of a license hoard to handle
license questions now bclonglrfg to the
office of the tax assessor.
Provision for- an annual tax on au
tomobiles, in lieu of a license tsg fee.
A requirement that "true considera

In the District.
Legislation Increasing the powers of
the Commissioners to remove from of

The District bill will be taken up In
the House on Wednesday, according
to present plans, and debate will be
concluded tomorrow on the legislative,
executive and Judicial budget.

NO INAUGURAL BALL,
WILSON ANNOUNCES
Definitely Tells Callers That
There Will Be No Such
Function This Year.
President Wilson definitely stated
to callers today that there will be no
Inaugural bait.
The President had nothing to say
about the' question of a substitute for
the Inaugural ball. His mind Is un
derstood to be open on this question.
The President will have a confer
ence with Col. Robert N. Harper,
chairman of the Inaugural committee,
late this week, and this question of
holding some other social function to
take the place of the time-honored
Inaugural ball will then be discussed.
The President's definitely formed
decision In opposition to the Inaug
ural ball became known at the re
sumption of conferences with the
newspaper men.
It also became definitely known
that the President has not fully made
up his mind with respect to the ques
tion of an all-year Saturday half -holiday
for Government clerks. He Is
still considering this matter, but Is
not yet ready to announce a decision.
