Lloyd-George is Expected to
Make His "Peace Address"
in the Commons
on Tuesday.
I UNITED STATES WILL
DELAY NOTE TO ALLIES
No Suggestion That Ger
many's Peace Terms be
Considered Will be Made
For Several Weeks.
Irp-ra.ition.il .News Service :
LONDON. Dec. 1 X- When
Premier Lloyd -George appears before
commons probably tomorrow to
make his "peace address," he will
he prepared, it is said, to ask King
Georpe to dissolve parliament and
tall a Kctieral election if organized
antagonism develops to the prin
ciple he proclaims.
From an authoritative source it in
reported that the premier will re
aflirm the declarations formerly
made by ex-Premier Asquith, name
ly that Germany must pive up the
territory she has overrun: make
recompense for the suffering she ha
caused, and pive guarantees for the
future that shall remove the menace
of militarism.
However, the premier may po
further, in view of the delicate dip
lomatic situation which arises. It is
likely that he will announce that
the attitude of the new war govern
ment on peace i.- held by a majority
of the people.
Then, if a disagreement develops
among the members of the house,
he will be given the opportunity of
asking the king to take the opinion
of the people at the polls.
Want Permanent Pcmce.
While there is a division among
the newspapers as to the manner in
which the German peace proposals
shall be treated, all are united on
one thing, and that is to make peace
iis permanent as possible if devel
opments should lead to an actual
conference.
Disoatches from Amsterdam indi
cate tnat there is little hope in Ger
many that th peace proposals will
result in ;t peace parley within the
immediate future. Hut there is hope
that the German proffer will lead to
further interchanges which will
eventually lead to a conference. If
this conference takes place, it will
probably sit at The Hague.
Opposition to the acceptance of
the proposals has developed from a
brand new source. There are some
ctticials in the government who are
opposed to dealing with Dr. von
Fethmann-Holhveg so long as the
present c hancellor is in ottice. This
pposition is based cHelly upon the
utterance of the chancellor early in
the war when he referred to the
treaty guararteeing Belgium's neu
trality as a scrap of paper."
WILL II:L.V ACTION.
WASHINGTON. Dec. IS. Several
weeks probably will elapse before
the administration will urge upon
Pncland and its allies grave and
earnest consideration of the Teutonic
offer to discuss peace.
Several reasons weie asigned to
day for this f.-i( t by those in touch
with the president. The principal
reasons for withholding immediate
action hy the American government,
i was said, are these:
1 To gie tin entente govern
ments time t discuss the (Icrman
offer.
To minimi' the risk of a re
I uli' when the American note of siii,--
ge.-tion is ieceied in the entente
capitals.
To live up to the request of the
central powers that the I'nited
States merely forward the peace
offer tit their enemies.
4 To have tune to ascertain un
olhviallv, through American diplo
matic agents. how the American
tucgesti.ui vv ill he received.
Pasing their belief that the time
for action hy the Fnite.1 tSates s
not ripe on the attitude indicated by
the action of the Pussian duma re
cently, ad mini.-tration olliciats. Pack
ed by th advice of neutral diplo
mats here, are counsellinir dclav inc
th.e i r.tem plate! action of the
I'nited States. It is hoped that the
feeling in Petrograd may be shaped,
through the ir.r'.uence of London and
Farts, to admit of at least discussion
of the peace öfter of its enemies.
