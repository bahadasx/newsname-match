Auditors Say Electric Company

Street Railway Does Not Owe

The Tnnekit Kiltunn cinipnny owes the

enrneil hv the company upon the actual
asli value of Its investment.
That is the substance of a report
presented to the city commissioners
at their regular meeting this morning
l.y the J. K. Caton Audit company.
Several months ago the city employed
the audit company to examine the
books of the Tupeka Railway company
and the Topeka Edison company and
determine:
The amount of capital invested by
the companies in its Topeka plant.
The total receipts from each and
every Upixtrt ment of the company's
business.
The total amount of expenditures
for all purposes.
The improvements made during each
year within the period examined.
The amount they shall pay into the
treasury under the ordinances ex
ist! n k.
Not u Cent to City.
While the report of the street rail
way company was not submitted this
morniny it is proctically complete, it
is known that the report will show
the railway company does not owe
the city a cent under its method of
computing valuation.
Mr. C'aton in iiis report on the street
railway company will endeavor to
show "that there is too much water in
the capital of the company, which
makes it impossible for the earnings
to ever become sufficient to net the
city any income under its contract
with the city."
.Mr. Caton presented the report in
, rson. According to his figures,
based upon his valuation of the plant,
the Topeka Kdison company should
iiave paid .noney into the city treas
ury every year since 1910. Instead,
according to Caton's report, it has
made only three payments, those in
the last three years, amounting to $4,
STt'.iij. And according to his figures
the pavnients in the last three years
fall s! ort by $10,377.21 of the
amounts he believes the Edison com
pany should have turned over to the
city treasury.
Conitunies Have Co-owratcI.
Mr. Caton lauded both the Street
Railway company and the Kdison
company f-r co-operating in obtain
ing data necessary. He found the
books of both companies almost total
ly free of errors and it has all nar
rowed down as to whether the esti
mate on valuation, i r capital, of the
twit companies is fair and just, or
whether the valuation and capital
placetl by Mr. Caton is fair and Just.
This the city commissioners must de
termine and then, if they agree with
Caton's report, steps must be taken
to yet the two companies to agree to
comply with the payments due the
city as claimed by Mr. Caton. This
probably will not be determined for
tome time. It may be that the matter
will no to the courts.
Caton's Figures.
The amounts claimed due the city
each year since 1H10 from the Edison
company, together with the amounts
paid the city by the company on a val

The present valuation of the Kdison

report sni unit ted by Burns and Mc
I tune II, expert engineers, on Decem
ber 31. 1914. is $1,131,334.93. Caton
places a valuation of $830,674.93. The
difference is J3M0.660, which is made
lip of three itemK. intereRt during con
struction, amounting to $10,660; work

going value, amounting to $265,000.
Both valuations were made on the
reproduction method. Caton working

sulting engineers but cutting material

three items mentioned.
I ucps Ieprcclat in.
Caton also reduces the depreciation
claimed by the company from about
i per cent to 3 per cent.
'aton reduces the item in the Burns
and McDonnell report called "interest
during construction, from $63,960 to
$53,300.
"We do this." said Caton, "because
we believe that the estimat. construc
tion period is too long, and because it
is b;ised upon 'reproduction cost less
depreciation. rather than upon what
the books show to have been actually
paid tor interest during the construc
tion period."
''aton cuts out entirely the $25,000
claimed by the company as a part of
its valuation as "working capital."
"If this item of $25,000 does not ap

action. "If this item of $25,000 does

fifteenth of December, according to
the announcement made by the
French war office this morning. A
violent German counter attack on the

AUTO CRASH KILLS 3

Hobart, Okla., Dec. 18. Three per

freight train at Mountain Park, near
here, lawt Sunday. The dead are:

tal account, what then has become of
it?' asks Caton. "It must have either
been restored to Its owners or con
verted into permanent property. If
returned to the owners, it certainly
should not reappear as a part of per
manent investment. If, on the other
hand, it has been exchanged for per
manent property, the property for
which it was exchanged is already in
cluded in the investment values fixed
by the company's engineers."
Going value also is entirely cut out
of Caton's estimate. The definition of
going value upon which the Edison
company bases its figuring is that it
I is a "summation of losses that may be
reasonably expected were it necessary
to reproduce the present business of
the existing company."
I ten son for His Action.
Caton's strongest argument for cut
ting out the going value clause is that
"the prosperous condition of the com
pany's business during the period ex
amined would seemingly justify the
elimination of going value from the
company's investment upon the the
ory that its earnings have been suf
ficient to more than offset any actual
expenditures for early losses during
the business development period."
Caton cuts the depreciation down
materially, claiming that maintenance
normal and preferred, which is a de
preciation item listed by the company,
is provided for from operating ex
penses, covering ordinary repairs, re
newals and replacements that are
necessary to keen the property per
manently in good working order.
"The only remaining depreciation is
functional and physical normal wear,"
said Caton. "A straight 3 per cent
depreciation as computed by us will
produce a gross revenue of $130,285.91
within the period examined."
On the other hand the depreciation
computed by the company since 1S10
amounts to $234,146.90.
In closing Caton suggests that both
the city and company will be better
served thru a mutual agreement to so
mend their existing contractual rela
tions with reference to the city's share
in the company's earnings as to pro
vide for a percentage of the company's
annual gross instead of its annual net
earnings.
The surplus revenues of the com
pany in the last ten years, according
to Caton's report, have been $413,-426.24.

jPREMIER'S SPEECH TOMORROW
Believe He Will Outline What
Allies' Demands Are.
Don't Expect Him to Reject
Offer Unequivocally.
"Washington, Dec. 18. "United States
officials are convinced today there can
be no formal discussion of peace until
Germany and Austria avow their will
ingness to restore Belgium and Serbia
and until all nations involved are
ready to disarm on a rather large
scale.
In his forthcoming speech Premier
Lloyd-George, of England, is expected
to insist on such terms as a funda
mental groundwork for any formal
parleys and such action on his part
would serve to "pass the buck" back
to Germany .
Moreover, officials believe, he will
outline fully what the allies are fight
ing for. but in no circumstances will
he voice a scornful or flat rejection of
the German offers.
W hat Uncle Sam Thinks.
The United Press is in a position
today to give a detailed outline of this
government's convictions on the sev
eral angles of peace developments.
They are:
It is believed Germany offered peace
because her people were becoming
restive.
It is believed the people of all coun
trieswant peace America included
so long as there is no sacrifice of the
principles for which the fighting has
been going on.
This government is convinced there
can be no formal discussion of peace
unless such discussion carries an
avowed willingness by Germany and
Austria to restore Belgium and Serbia.
There can be no peace without as
surances of disarmament on a large
scale in all countries with some plan
for alliance of nations to prevent fu
ture wars. J
Won't Pass Buck to Germany.
No reason is seen why Lloyd -George,
when he addresses the commons,
should fail to outline the general peace
terms of the allies.
Unequivocal rejection of the Teuton
proffer would immediately re-act to
England's disadvantage in neutral
countries, it is believed.
It would also result in embittering
the German people to the point where
they would unite more solidly than
ever behind a government, the form
of which England desires to destroy.
The German people would then be
convinced theirs was a war for exist
ence and would urge its ruthfulness
and unrestricted pursuit.
Public Backs Up War Council.
London, Dec. 18. "When Premier
Lloyd-George addresses parliament to
morrow and outlines the policy of his
government, he will find the pulse of
the British people beating in unison
with that of the war council.
Interest is intense here today in the
reply the premier will make to Beth-mann-Hollweg's
peace proposals and
his discussion of the food problem
and the question of man power.
Mob Hushes Miss Pankhurst.
The temper of the British people
toward peace was indicated when a
huge mob yesterday attacked Sylvia
Pankhurst as a "pacifist." With a
group of her sympathizers. Miss
Pankhurst attempted to hold a "dem
onstration" at the East India dock
gates to demand peace. An angry
crowd quickly gathered and rushed
Miss Pankhurst and another party
from their feet. Police interference
put an end to the demonstration, but
a Jeering crowd followed the women
to police headquarters, where the
prisoners were held under bail for ex
amination by a magistrate.
It is expected Lloyd -George will
give a brief and comprehensive review
of the war in his parliament speech
and will outline what has been accom
plished under the other regime and
what he expects to accomplish thru
the war council.
Comment on the more Intimate in
cidents which led to the recent gov
ernmental upheaval and placed
Lloyd-George at the head of the cabi
net is not expected.
FROWN ON SACRIFICE
Large Publishers Dislike Cutting Or
ders to Help Needy Editors.
Washington. Dec. 18. Efforts to
find relief for the news print paper
shortage and prevailing high prices
were continued today by the federal
trade commission in conference with
committee of newspaper, publishers,
newsprint manufacturers and paper
jobbers.
A plan discussed proposes tint pub
lishers of the larger newspars re
duce their purchase next year by five
per cent so smaller papers may receive
more of the supply. Questions were
sent today to large publishers to as
certain they will , subscribe to this
plan, relinquishing five per cent of
their 1917 contracted supply, and to
small publishers to learn their 1917
needs. At the same time the manu
facturers' - committee was trying to
learn the exact amount of paper stock
on hand in the United States and the
amount that will be manufactured for
next year's- needs:
The larger publishers are not well
satisfied with the plan proposed con
tending it forces them to make sacri
fices to supply the small publishers
when the manufacturers could solve
the whole problem readily by divert
ing to newsprint, manufacture paper
making machines now working on
wrapping paper.

San Angelo, Tex., Dec. IS. The coal
shortage on the Kansas City, Mexico
& Orient railway has become acute,
according to local offiicals of the road.
San Angelo and the trade territory
dependent on it, face1 a serious situa
tion, the available coal supply having
been exhausted. The board of city
development has wired the Santa Fe
general office at Galveston urging
that road to run fuel trains.
Kansas City, Dec. 1 8. Admission
was made at the general offices of the
Kansas City, Mexico & Orient Railway
company that the reported coal short
age had become "rather acute."
"We have been forced to cut down
on some of our service," it was said
at the office of E. Dickinson, president
of the road.
"The trouble is that we have no
mines upon our own lines and have
been forced to depend upon other
roads for our supply. They are hard
pressed, too, but we have taken over
some fuel designed for private com
panies and individuals.
No statement was made concerning
the steps being taken to solve the coal
problem.

w-ith blood. It probably contained
kerosene which was poured over the
bodies of the victims after the killing.

Oppenheini Appeals Decision;
Case Involves Mystery.
Xew Tork, Dec. 18. Baron Robert
Emmanuel Oppenheim. a French and
English financier, was ordered de
ported from the United States after a
hearing before the board of inquiry of
the bureau of immigration here today.
He appealed immediately to the de
partment of labor at Washington.
New Tork, Dec. 18. After spending
the time since his arrival in port on
the liner Noordam under guard, locked
in his state room. Baron Robert E.
Oppenheim of Paris, was today taken
to Ellis Island for examination.
Mystery has surrounded the deten
tion of Baron Oppenheim and the
cause of his detention is not yet
known. A two-months tour of the
United States in connection with some
banking business is the purpose for
which Baron Oppenheim says he came
to America.
Brought $500,000 With Him.
The Ellis Island officials said that
the orders to hold Oppenheim, who
arrived on the Noordam yesterday,
came from the bureau of immigration
at Washington, to which all inquiries
were referred. Word came from
Washington that the immigration de
partment knew nothing there of the
detention. Oppenheim's only expla
nation for his being held is that "it
might be a case of mistaken identity."
A circumstantial report was current
that Oppenheim had arrived here with
$500,000 in cash and securities which
he had with him, it was said, when re
moved to the Island.

"Wets" Spend Thousands.
The "wet" adherents have enlisted
in their cause hundreds of prominent

Amsterdam, Dec. 18. The positive
statement that a peace conference will
be held at The Hague about January
1" Is made In a significant article In
the Frankfurter Zeitur.g, leading Ger
man financial orga;, according to dis
patches from Berlin.
The paper states that It is not Ger
many's wish to brins about an armis
tice, but that military operations are
to continue while the conference is in
session.
While predicting a wide cleavage of
views at the outset of the peace nego
tiations the paper is oplir.iistic as to
the outcome of the conference. It
urges that the entente must be pre
vented by all mean:: from evading a
positive answer to Germany's peace
offer. The article points out that al
ready there exists certain identical
general fundamental aims of the war
and adds that Germany's note must

NURSING ASSOCIATION PLAN
All Are Children Who Can't
Fay for Treatment.
Adenoids and Tonsils Are To Be
Removed by Specialists.
Seventy-five poor children in To-
! peka will undergo operations ror ade
i noids and throat trouble free of
charge in Topeka hospitals during the
i Christmas holidays. Announcement
J of this remarkable innovation in pub
! lie health work in Topeka was mad
; today at the city hall where the Pub
i lie Health Nursing association has its
j headquarters.
Five Topeka specialists have con
sented to bestow the greatest of all
Christmas gifts, unimpaired health, to
! the seventy-five school children. They
are: Drs. H. L. Alkire, G. H. Allen.
G. V. Allen, D. E. Esterly, G. H. I-.it-!

, to provide operating rooms and nurses
for the children following their opera -!
tions are: Stormont, St. Francis and
! Christ's.
I Months of Hard Work.
i The actual realization of this plan
follows months of the most painstak
ing work on the part of the Topeka
Public Health Nursing association.
Miss Bertha Saville, director of the
association, and Mrs. Mary G rover,
school nurse for the association, havo
directed the preliminary work inci
dental to the realization of the plan.
First was the examination of the
children. Next, delicate inquiries to
ascertain the financial standing of the
parents of children whose future
health was found to be impaired by
adenoids and bad throats.
j Aversion to Knife.
! Aversion to a surgeon's knife had
j to be overcome, often requiring days
of argument. The authorities of the
, hospitals had to be visited and the
plan explained. The busy specialists
I had to be called upon. Individually,
j and there yet remains a huge task in
j preparing for the operations, schedul
4g.,them, co-operating with, the -ho-j
pitals "in providing for the unprece
i dented bit of public health work and
1 last but not least, getting the children
I to the hospitals at the proper time. .

"Undoubtedly there are many more
poor children who need operations of
this character," said Miss Saville to
day.. "Yet, I believe in the scheduU
t ing of seventy-five operations at this
i time we have made an excellent be-
ginning in the realization of a dream
j in which the children of the poor will
i start in life, equal, in health, at lenst.

Report Carranza Reply to Mex
ican Conference Protocol.
Refusal to Ratify 31 ay End
Commission's Efforts.
Philadelphia. Dec. 1 8. Continua
tion of the efforts of the Mexican
American joint commission to effect a.
satisfactory agreement on questions
affecting the international relations,
depended largely on the result of its
session today which was called for
the purpose of hearing General Car
ranza's decision regarding the proto
col signed at Atlantic City and sent to
him for ratification.
Alberto J. I'ani, one of the Mexi
can commissioners, carried the docu
ment to Mexico and returned with a,
report which has been designated by
the Mexican representatives as th
comment of the Mexican executive. It
was to hear his report that the com
missioners gathered here.
It was indicated that a refusal by
Carranza to ratify the agreement
reached after three months' discus
sion would offer no alternative other
than the dissolution of the commission
but that, if the report showed by the
Mexicans indicated his desire to dis
cuss only minor alterations, the con
ference might be resumed for a brief
period.
The Americans intimated, however,
that long iscussion of subjects al
ready covered in the agreement signed
would not be tolerated --d that radl
c change, espet Jly any demand for
the immediate withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Chihv hua, would
not be granted.
