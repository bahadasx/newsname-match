Sec It Whole.
We have shown that (lie condition

and employment of human
force in the west is the reorganization
nf tl ntii llritish front for mum-
pie thi usts and surprise

to press on with it at once is an iir-(t.-nt

'hiving power who know what they

i vent, implies a lorn,'. Brim si rustle,
mid wo have the. stomach tor it. Any
ma., hu doubts thatany man who
either makes easy pictures or flinches
from the harder picture should bu
swept out of public life.
Must Increase Forces.
This is a European war and a
Wo, id war. We must increase, and
hugely, our folios in the west. Hut,
within limits, we must make a bigger
and hotter effort in the east as well.
Wo must unmistakably he equal to
both. Nothing else will cope with
Ilindenburg. No loss stirring and de
termined temper will enable us to win
lhc war. To pore obstinately over the
west alone until nil vital sense of its
connection with other theaters is al
most lost is military myopia. The ut
most and ablest, efforts In the nearest
tinnier will not of themselves suffice
to win the struggle within any think
able period. Across Fiance and Hol
giuin the Germans will have to bo
weakened morally and materially hy
tores and ev?nts elsewhere before the
Kianco-Kritish armies can break
through in the final phase of Anna
Kedilon. For nearly two years this
journal has been pointing out. that our
purposes across the narrow seas never

The
success of the general

without

insular people, if they have Riven no
very special study to the matter, find
very difficult to understand, Germany
Is not mi Island dependent on the
freedom of Its ports. Germany is at
the head of n huge continental federa
tion with additional occupied areas,
comprising the labor-power as well as
the, fighting power of 1 1; n. Imhi, ,i tl 0 ot
people, covering a magnificent range
of territories, abounding in natural
products, agricultural and mineral.
Sou Blockade Not I. noil" h.
Sea blockade in those circumstances
cannot cut off a sufficient proportion
of the supplies or oven pi-event our
vigorous and knowledgeable enemy
from increasing those supplies more
and more so Ions as we are blind to
the economic meaning of the east.
The immense region now under Ger
many's unfettered direction and con
trol is being cultivated and exploited
as never before. It may well prove,
therefore, that Germain- by next year
will he past the worst of the economic
pinch.
What. (;ei'inany Does.
Look at some of the facts. Steam
plows are being brought into Ser
bia, and no doubt will he sent also into
Poland, Rulgaria and Turkey. Apart
from that labor is conscripted
throughout, the ottoman dominions.
The Germans who know all the ins
and outs of the resources of thai em
pire are concentrating on the best
areas, and they are anions- the most
fertile in the world. The soil of Tur
key will yield next year as never before
since Turkey was. This very week
comes the news that the great Tau
rus tunnel has boon pierced, a mighty
feat, of engineering in war. The llag
dad railway will soon be completed.
These things alone would moan a re
markable reinforcement of German
ability to sustain the struggle. Fvon
these things stand no longer alone.
The fight for Kumania Is absolutely
vital to all the allies. If Fnlkenhayn
and Maokenscn could conquer even
the rich W'allachian half of the Km
nianian dominion, our chief enemy's
supply of grain and oil would be so
largely increased that Germany there
after could laugh for indefinite years
at the threat of a stranglehold.
What Rumania Means in War.
We hope and believe that Falko.ii
hnyn and Mai koiisrn, though their
forces have joined hands across the
Danube, will not conquer all Ku
mania or anything like it. Yet (he
enemy will gii.n at least a valuable
though smaller part of western Ku
mania. and we must thoroughly un
derstand what. Is t stake. It is not
