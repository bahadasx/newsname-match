SMSJILII
German Papers I sists It Will Ee
Held at the Hague
HOSTILITIES NOT TO CEASE
Germany Has Terms to Propose But
Will Not Name Them Unless
Conference is Held.
Amsterdam, Doc. 17. The positive
statement that a peaco conference
will take place at The- Hague about
January 15 is mado in a significant ar
ticle in the Frankfurter Zeitung, lead
ing German financial organ, according
to dispatches from Berlin today.
The paper states that it la not
Germany's wish to bring about an
armistice but that military opera
tions are to continue w hile the confer
ence is in session.
While predicting a wide cleavage
of views at the outset of the peace
negotiations, the paper is optimistic
as to the outcome of the conference.
It urges that the Entente must be pre
vented by all means from evading a
positive answer to Germany's peace
offer.
The article points out that already
there exist certain Identical general
fundamental aims of the war and
adds that Germany's note must bo
interpreted as aiming at a reestablish
ment of international conventions.
These conventions, it says, are to pre
vent future international conflicts and
are to safeguard world peace.
The paper expresses confidence
that an agreement regarding arma
ment can he reached. It emphasizes,
however, that Germauy is not pre
pared to take the lead in reducing
armament nor willing in any circum
stances to abolish universal military
service. That could be possible only
If a common organization of nations
were to be cieated, the paper says.
adding that Germany would take a
leading place In such a league.

WHEAT PRICES DOWN
Drop in Chicago Due to Rumors of
Peace.
Chicago, Dec. 15. In a frantic
stampede today wheat prices were
trampled down 13 V cents a bushel.
1 be prime reason for tho break was a
German official suggestion of limited
but universal disarmament.
First downturns in wheat values, al
though sensational, did not exceed
ii'-KC a bushel, whereas the final few
minutes of business witnessed the
last of a series of additional smashes,
that carried tho market just four
cents a bus'hel still lower. Stock
market weakness and reports that
leading neutrals, especially the
United States, were giving Indica
tions of readiness to assist in a stop
page of the war tended materially to
keep the Wheat market headtd most
of the time for lower and lower lev
el;:. Estimates from Washington that
the 1916 yield of wheat in the United
States was 32,000.000 bushels more
than was generally supposed did a
good deal to discourage bulls yet fur
ther In the last part of the session.
Fluctuations, nevertheless, continued
to depend in the mean on the chances
of peace and there was a tumultous
close.
New York, Doc. 13. Flour prices
were demoralized by the break in
wheat today and dropped almost 50c
a barrel with spring patents quoted at
$S a barrel. This Is a $2 a barrel de
clino from the recent high point.

TOMORROW OK,
LICENSE
Sunday and Followers Expect ta
Carry the City Dry
SITUATION IS CALLED CRITICAL
Last Year the "Wet" Majority was
15,C00 But Only About Half the
Votes In City Were Cast.
Boston, Dec. 18. As a result of a
campaign to step the saie of intoxicat
ing liquors in Boston, other issues of
tho municipal elec.tion to be held to
morrow have been almost crowded
out, and there are indications that the
vote on the license question will bo
unusually close. The Boston real es
tato exchange, advocating retention
of the existing limited license system,
announces in a public statement that
"it is a critical situation," and that
"a few thousand votes may turn the
scale."
Tho campaign for no-license in Bos
ton, with its 750,000 persons, has
bi-en pushed with an energy never
previously approached. The evange
listic services conducted by Rev.
William A. Sunday have been devoted
largely to lectures on temperance and
his "trail hitters" at many meetings
have been pledged to vote "no,." The
antisaloon league, which has charge
of the no license activities, has kept
a big forte or orators, moving picture
exhibitors and pamphlet distributors
at work for weeks.
The city voted last year 46.115, ye-3;
31.877, no; a majority of 14,238. Reg
istration this year is the largest on
record, about 120,000 and a much
laiger voto than last year Is expected.
BRAZILIAN DARK LOST
Nethtis and 12 Men Went Down In
New York, Doc. 17. The Brazilian
bark Nethtis with 12 men on board
was lost during the snowstorm Friday
night off Barneeat, on the New Jersey
ccast, according to Capt, Moroes of
the tug Garibaldi, which arrived here
late today. The Nethtis was in tow of
the Garibaldi on her way from Maran
ham, Brazil, to be. converted into a
steam vessel.
The bark was lost, according to
Capt. Moroes, by the breaking under
the strain of the wind and high seas
of the chain tackle to which the tow
line was fastened. This occurred
shortly before 7 p. m. and for seven
hours the tug searched through the
blinding storm for some trace of her
tow, repcateding sounding her
whistles and burning lights to attract
the attention of the men on board the
helpless craft.
The quest was unavailing, however,
and at daylight Saturday the tag
came on to New York to report the
loss. Coastguard authorities and life
saving stations along the North At
lantic coast were notified and asked
to look out for the men.
Tho Nethtis Is not registered in
available shipping records. Capt. Mor
tes said, however, that she was a ves
sel with three masts of a size that
would permit her being made into a
steamer. She was consigned to Barber
and Company, steamship agents here,
and was to have been fitted up in a
New York shipyard. The 12 men on
tho bark were Brazilians.
RUMANIA AND VERDUN
Overseas News Agency Says Wal
lachian Campaign is Over.
The following comment on the mili
tary situation in Rumania and Verdun
sector of France Is given out for pub
lication by the Overseas news acency
at Berlin:
"Operations in Wallachia can now
be considered as terminated.' Buzeu,
which has now fallen into the hands
of tho central powers, is the last im
portant railroad point in Wallachia.
The allies (Teutonic) now control
two-thirds of tho Rumanian railroad
lines. Tho Buzeu and Jalomlaza riv
ers form the second and third strate
gical lines.
"The most recent German successes
finally have provoked a greater ac
tlvitv on tho western front, but tho
great new attack on the Meuse
I launched by tho French after strong
artillery preparation, cannot modify
the general situation. Such offensive
thrusts carried out with all available
means, ares always successful at the
beginning.''

THREE CORNERED
MAYOR FIGHT
rill I ADAMS
Annual Election in Tunnel City
Cccurs Tomorrow
CITY IS EXPECTED TO GO WET
Mayor Gale Seeks Reelection and Is
Opposed by Republican and
Independent Candidates.
North Adams, Dec. 17. The annual
city election takes place Tuesday and
there is considerable Interest in the
outcome of the hght for mayorality
honors. Three candidates are in the
field. Mayor John V. Gale seeks re
elction on the Democratic ticket. He
was beaten for the nomination by At
torney John H. Mack but, when the
latter decided not to accept the honor,
Mr. Gale was named as his party's
representative through the commit
tee on vacancies. Dr. Wallace E.
Brown, who served three terms as
Mayor previous to last year, when he
was defeated by Mr. Gale, 13 the Re
publican nominee.
Ezra E. Whitaker, a life long Re
publican and foniier president of the
city council, is an independent can
didate. It is generally conceded that
the fight rests between Dr. Brown end
Mr. Whitaker although there are
these who believe that the split in the
ranks of the Republicans may pos
sibly result in Mr. Gale coming
through a winner.
Asido from the mayoralty contest,
interest rests in the race for school
committeemen. Dr. F. J. O Hara and
Charles F. Frink are both candidates
for reelection but Frank A. Bond, a
Republican candidate promises to
give both a hard fight.
Mayor Gale has completed an in
vestigation regarding the high cost of
coal in the city and, as a result, he
announced the local dealers are in no
way to blame for the advanced prices ,
which prevail. He states conditions
are brouKi iut b iiie congested
freight traffic Which causea delays in
shipments of coal from the mines.
Mayor Gale has received assurances
that the situation will Boon be re
lieved and that prices will lower.
