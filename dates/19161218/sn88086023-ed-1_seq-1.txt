FI DAMAGES OLD
LANDMARK OF CITY
Top Van of Frame Building on We-4
Webh and aleii Street 1st IK'
stroyed ljutut Irf ITnctically Cover
ed by Insurance.
Fire early yesterday morning prac
tically destroyed the top part of the
old frame building at the corner ot
West Webb and Garden streets, which
is a landmark of Pendleton. The fire
was discovered about 2:50 In tho
morning and had gained such a head
way that It took the fire department
40 minutes to get It under control.
The damage la practically all covered
by Insurance.
The building was occupied by the
Owl lodging house and by Rains and
Boucher's meat shop. It was owned
by Henry ShulU.
The fire is supposed to have started
from a defective flue in the garret.
It was not discovered until It had
burned through the celling lno the
bedroom of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence
Bowlsby. The alarm was turned In
by Ed Croft, night clerk of the 3t.
George Hotel. j
When the firemen arrived the en
tire upper portion was In flames. The
tin roof made It difficult to reach
not being overlooked and it is very
possible that steps will be taken to
encourage the college authorities In
their attitude. It Is suggested that
the Round-Cp association should of
fer the use ot the grounds, that the
business men might promise to close
their stores for the game and that
some assurance be given that the
game would be widely advertised.
Such a game would undoubtedly
draw a great crowd to Pendleton from
all parts of eastern Oregon for few
residents of thla country are given
the opportunity of seeing intercol
legiate football. If the first suili
game were made a big success, it
would not be unlikely that either O.
A. C, or Oregon could be Induced
each year to stage a game here with
one of the three big colleges of the
Inlund empire.

Hospital.
John Dungan. a young railroad map
of Pendleton, died at St. Vincent's
hospital in Portland on the morning
of the 14th, according to a letter re
ceived by the East Oregonian this
morning. The fact that there are two
John Dungans who are Pendleton rail
road men and that both have been In
SI. Vincent's hospital led to a mistake
of almost serious consequences.
The deceased John Dungan, as far
ns can be learned, was a member of
a family living at Rleth. John B.
Dungan, an O.-W. brakeman, is the
husband of one of the daughters of
