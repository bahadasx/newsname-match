GERMANS BUY PEACE STOCKS;
SELL WAR SHARKS
[Bj Wireless to The Tribune via ??.mille. ]
r.crlin, Dec. 17.?The Central European peace offer?
ing was exceedingly well accepted by (iermany's popula?
tion, though the majority fears that the new British Cabi?
net is not yet ready for peace. The Stock Exchange is
rather optimistic, selling war favorites and buying "peace"
securities, such as the shares of navigation companies. The
.sudden and rapid drop of reichsmark exchange i-*? now re?
placed by the rapid rise in Holland and Switzerland, prov?
ing that such change in often caused by trifles.
Latest reports from Rumania show that Mackensen's
army found far more grain than expected, including large
stores bought and paid for by England, and the oil fields
apparently are scarcely damaged.
Germany is already handling traffic on the Danube
down to Cernavoda and from there by railway to Con
stanza, on the Black Sea. Altogether, German railroad
men are now handling 70 per cent of the traffic by seized
Rumania wagons and locomotives.
The offcial potato crop estimate of 26,000.000 tons,
against 45,000,000 to 50,000,000 tons, is doubted by many
experts, as the new crop outlook has been favored by sea?
sonable weather.

Indica'ioni that German financiers

Mr. Zimmermann explained his recent
action in offering (ierman and Austrian
exchange at present price?, payable in
ninety days in Rerlin and Vienna, on
th? grounds that he was cnnvmc?d. a?
a result of advices from hij-b quarters
abroad, that, peace would have been
bronchi about by that time.
Weight was attached to this ?tate?

fa?t that, th? Zimmermann firm ha?
,?cerned to have arc??? to avenue? of

Diplomat Says Ger?
many Will Give Guar?
antee for Future
Rerlin, Oec. 17 i by wireless to Say-:
i ville i. Some sections of the foreign
| rress and especially newspapers in hos
' tile countries having declared that the :
\ Central Powers ought to have added !
? definitive peace proposals, to their
oeace offer, the semi-official Overseas
| News Agency asked a <I. st inguished
.German diplomat for h:-> opinion on
i this point. His answer was:
"The (?erman note to the EateatS
governments contains a very definite
communication ns to the spirit of the
peace conditions which the (epiral
Powers would bring to the prop"-e |
negotiations.
"The Central Towers ba?e these pro?
posals on the conviction that their own
? and just claims to day are not
in contradiction to the rights of other
nations. In addition, the Central Tow
CI ? declare they d?> BOt want to an?
nihilate or ?leytroy anvbody, and that
the peace proposals will be of such a
nature as to guarantee the esrablish
ment of a lasting peace.
"To go further in outlining the peace
ronditions would have meant a handi
