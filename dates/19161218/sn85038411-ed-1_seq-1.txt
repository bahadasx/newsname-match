$20,000 FIRE IN
► UNIVERSAL MILL
OF CENTRAL IRON
500 Men Thrown Out of Work
For Several Days by Early
Morning Blaze
\YATER SUPPLY POOR
One Line of Hose Extends 1,000
Feet Under Pennsy's Main
Line Tracks
Fire, starting early this morning in
the electrical equipment of the Uni
versal Mill at the Central Iron and
Steel Co., caused almost J20,000 dam
ages before It was extinguished, halt
ed operations temporarily in three de
partments and threw 500 men out of
work for several days.
The blaze, which broke out shortly
before 4.30 o'clock, was discovered by
night workmen. An alarm was sent
in from Box 12. Front and Dock
streets, but before the firemen arrived
the flames spread along the frame
work of the Universal plant, to the
boiler house, destroying much of the
framework of that building.
Water Supply Poor
Poor water supply hindered the
firemen in getting enough streams on
the blaze. One line of hose, extend
ing more than 1,000 feet had to be
laid under the yard and main line
tracks of the Pennsylvania railroad.
According to Fire Chief John C. Klnd
ler. the water supply at the plant is
inadequate in case of fire.
All the wires and switchboards of
the Universal mills were either totally
destroyed or damaged almost beyond
repair. High power electric lines
supplying the 72-inch ana 89-inch
plate plants in Mill No. 2 pass through
the Universal Mill, and they were
damaged.
When the alarm for under control
was sent in the north side of the Uni
versal mill, and the boiler house were
masses of twisted iron rods and sheet
ing, charred timbers and ice. as the
water pteyed on the fire, froze in a few
minutes.
Start Repairs at Once
More than 100 workmen began re
pairs at once and according to Robert
H. Irons, general superintendent of
the company, operations at Mill No. 2
will be resumed probably to-morrow
morning, and in the Universal mill to
-morrow evening.
™ Several weeks ago a similar blaze
started in the electrical equipment of
Paxton mill, No. 1 of the steel com
pany, causing thousands of dollars of
damage before it was extinguished.
