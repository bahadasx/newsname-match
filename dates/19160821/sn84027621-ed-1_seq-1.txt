French Repulsed Attacks of Germans With
Liquid Fire at Fleury
lilt ALOHG THE EASTERN - FOQUT
London, Aug. 21. Italian troops
began to disembark at Saloniki yes
terday, according to press dispatches.
Active Italian participation in the
Saloniki . campaign would mean war
.between Italy and Germany. It may
also be taken to mean the allies have
embarked on a campaign of extensive
proportions in the Balkans as there
already is believed to be 700,000 Brit
ish, French and Serbians on the Sa
loniki front, where hostilities on a
; large scale opened last week. The
Bulgarians are aided by Germans and
some Turks and Austrians, although
it has been indicated that many Aus
trians were sent to the Italian and!
Russian fronts. ; ,,
France says operations are con-
: tinuing along the entire Balkan front!
and Greece is reported disquieted at!
the Bulgarian advance to within seven
miles of the Greek seaport of Kavala.
France announces the repulse of a
German liquid fire attack against
Fleury and reports artillery ' fighting
raging aloig the Somme front.
Russia announces additional ad
vances along the Stokhod river, and
claims the capture of 1300 prisoners
and many guns the last two days. A
delayed Austrian statement reports
several Russian repulses along Gen.
Von Hindenburg's front. .7
The Russians are vigorously press
ing through "two of the Carpathian
, passes towards Hungary, but are
meeting with stubborn resistance.
AUSTRIANS ELATED

Mr. G, A. Beckett, representing the
National Portland Cement, Associa
tion, 13 at the Harrington. tie says
that Marion county, having so much
material for the purpose ; right at
hand, should build cement roads. He
has just closed a contract for four
miles of two course concrete roadways
for the town of New Smyrna. Rock
obtained in Volusia county is to be
used for the bottom course, and gran

for the top course of the roadways.
Lake Weir sand is being used. Mr.
Beckett say a' that Lake Weir sand is
recognized by engineers as compar
ing most favorably with the famous
Ottawa sand 'of the middle west. A
half mile of the New .Smyrna roads

feet wide. The road will be six inches
thick, and will cost $1.38 a square

DIGGING DITCHES
Real Work of War Forcibly Impressed
on the Second Regiment
(Jacksonville Metropolis, 18th)
The boys of the Second this morn
ing began digging trenches.
Not that they expect to be attack
ed, but as a matter of preparedness
preparing them for such duty should
tbey be ordered to the border and
should, after such an order and its
execution, trench digging became nec
essary they would be thoroughly fa
miliar with all its details. -
The entire regiment was marched
considerably north of its camp, and
to a little used portion of the reser
vation. Trenches were staked out and
the back-breaking work started.
Regulation defensive trenches were
dug It was not haphazard work. A
first-line trench, three and a half feet
deep, with earth banked in front; sup
porting trenches and communicating
trenches were started. The sun broil
ed down and the men swung to their
work with the cheerful spirit which
has been noted every time the Second
has had to face hardship. Hundreds
of the boys had not previously made.
the acquaintance of tools of excava
tion, and, previous to mobilization,
could not have stood for an hour the
strain on muscles required in ditch
digging. However, this morning's
performance showed just what mill
tary training will do in the way of
making men physically fit, and the
trenches grew deeper and longer un
der the steady swing of the opera
tions.

RESUMING THE STUDY
OF GOOD ROADS
Editor Star: In the recent pro
paganda for bonds for, roads, some
have manifested a spirit that to
others may seem reactionary, among
them myself. I would Vote for bonds
instanter if I could persuade myself
hat in the roads built by sale of
bonds we would get our money's
worth in roads. We buy so many
gold bricks and white elephants that
I am gun-shy.
Mr. Peabody in the - Star of the
16th offers the best solution, so far,
in his remarks regarding concrete
roads, but his estimate, of cost per
mile is vastly too high and my opin
ion is that with the exercise of even
a modicum of inventiveness and ver
satility we can build our roads out of
Marion county material for about one
third the price of $8,u"00 per mile;
that is, if we do the job as econom
ically as any sane man would do it in
his private business.
'To begin with, we have our founda
tions already built. This lime rock
foundation is ideal for concrete, or
crushed rock as a top dress. Lime
rock roads in Florida deteriorate for
two reasons too much rain, or not
enough.
In the first plaee the lime rock
roads are eroded on the slopes, and
made into mudholes in the shade; in
the other, the lime is easily thrown
into a stifling dust, and disappears,
like a fond dream of prosperity.
A mighty good road can be built
out of crushed rock and p. better-and
more expensive one from concrete,
but in either case the mingling of the
material is really a fine art. You can
make an expensive crushed rock road
that will wear out in a few years,
or you can make an inexpensive one
that will be good after we have turn
ed to dust ourselves. You can make
concrete out of sand two parts and
cement one part, that will crumble
and fall apart, or you can make con
crete out of - just the right propor
tions of coarse gravel, fine gravel and
sand, and one-seventh of cement, that
will ring like an iron bar and get
better with age. It's all in knowing
how. ,
But there is more than that to
consider.
In laying roads for public use,
some one ought to be in control who
knows all about road material and
also knows how to make contractors
put it on when they are paid to put it
on. - - ,. '
There is not a particle of doubt but
that for the country a properly con
structed macadam road is the cheap
est and best, provided you can get
the material close at hand. In our
case it would seem to me wise to find
out if our flint rock is good material.
If it is, then buy a rock crusher and
dress our lime roads with a com
paratively "thin top of rock to pre
vent erosion.
For side streets in cities, I have
seen very good results from a combi
nation cement and rock. The center
of solid concrete about eight feet
wide, the sides of crushed rock
brought up flush with edges of con
crete. For cities in places where
traffic is not heavy it is both cheap
and effective; the center gets 90 per
cent of the wear. I enclose clipping
from Hastings (Mich.) Journal for
your consideration. Lester Warner.

COUNTRY C'OUSiJY
LISTENED TO CATTS
A Star reporter picked up the fol
lowing this morning. It was evident
ly writen by some one who was in
town to hear Catts Friday night, and
wrote his opinion to some one in
town, who after reading it dropped
it on the street. We omit the signa
ture and the postoflice it was sent
from:
"Waal, Bill, I thot I'd write and tell
yer that I got in my Ford and went
ter Okally nite before las' jeV ter hear
that fellow Catts what runned ergin
thet frien' of our'n in ther primary.
Waal, as I wuz sayin', this hereof el
low Catt is some talker on gineral
subjects confined largely ter himself.
I guess he ranted around somethin'
like a hour tellin' the 'sembled multi
tude of curus citizens and citizen
esses what er powerful memery he
had, and proved it by repeatin' er
speech he sed he had not sed in four
teen years, and tellin' thet he want no
boor whatever thet is no, he never
meant no animal, but that he was
lerned in the classes of , Rome and
Greese, and thet he would prove thet
too, and then he repeated thet sad and
pathetic little song out Annie Laurie
and a tother piece by Bob Taylor
bout 'Song er ther Battel," but, blame
me, ef I knowed thet Bob Taylor ever
wuz in er British battel, and how fine
he wuz when it came to high figurin,
which Knott sez is so, for he proved
hit in er number of precincts he had
counted particulerly, wuz he good et
showin' as how ther squar uz ther
hipotenuse wuz ekal ter ther sum er
ther squars uv tother two sides uv
er rite angle triangle, which may be
ther truth, but I don't believe it, and
then he made er few remarks erbout
ther ,dresses them highfilutin' city
gals wares. He sed at first thet he
helt er 'stificate uv nomination, , and
thet, begosh he would hold thet
'stificate no matter ter him what ther
'spreme cote sed erbout hit, an' he'd
go to jail in Okally 'fore he'd give hit
up, which is showly bluff or he's crazy
ter atack ther bulwalk uv our guver
ment like thet. Waal, all such things
'pertain' ter ther high offis uv gov
ciner he discussed at grate length,
and then he talked erbout such miner
matters uv ekalization uv taxes, of
which he sed he knew no thin' cept
what Iown Faris hed sed when he
made thet master piece speech in
Okally 'fore the primary, an' the pub
lic schools, an rite thar I thot he
would giv' them blamed Catholics
ther devil, but he never sed nothin'
ergin them furreners for they may be
erlowed ter vote in November, an
as how he would lam ther boys and
girls uv this fair state ter work,
yer know we'uns ain't never learned
thet yet, an how devoted he wuz to
ther interes' of Floridy in ways too
numerous ter mention in ther ? ten
minutes he had ter devote ter ther
miner matters, but ez all them things
did not pertain ter ther offis ter which
ther deer peepul had histed him, he
would resume thet more important
subject, hisself. "He sed thet he mite
want some petitions sined, an ? we
could send fer ther blanks ter J. V.
Burke in Jacksonville Bill, is thet
ther J. V. Burke what used ter live in
Okally, and he would send themand
ter vote for him, Sidney J. Catts.
Waal, L can't say as I didn't have a
good time et ther show, but I cum er
way sad ter think thet er state what
had had Drew, an Fleming an Blox

Employers Sticking to Principle
of Arbitration
AND ARE OPPOS
S0P1E WAY TO
(Associated
Washington, Aug. 21. Railroad
presidents and their committee of
managers worked steadily here today
to devise some means of averting the
threatened strike which would in the
main accept President Wilson's plan,
but at the same time preserve the
principle of arbitration, which has be
come the crux of the whole fight. No
conference between the railroad ex
ecutives and President Wilson is ex
pected before tomorrow. The brother
hood representatives, after a brief
meeting, adjourned to await develop
ments. Meanwhile they sent dele
gates to congressmen to inform them
of the details of the controversy. The
situation continued, as both sides ex
pressed it, serious but not hopeless.
Leaders of the railroad executives de
clared they are united against Presi
dent Wilson's plan as it now stands,
but hope to agree on some form of
counter proposal. Western railroad
presidents arriving today included
Lewis W. Hill of the Great Northern.
Many of them are optimistic of some
settlement. .
SUMMONED TO THE
HOUSE
WHITE
When the president was informed
this afternoon that all the western
railroad presidents who could get
here in a reasonable time, arrive, he
would summons them to the White
House, tl was said, however, they
would soon be prepared to give him a
final answer.

NEGRO BADLY CRUSHED
A negro man was run over by a
loaded log wagon near Lake Weir
this morning and so desperately
crushed that it was deemed unwise to
operate on him or attempt to bring
him to Ocala. Both of his legs should
be amputated,, but he is so weak that
an operation cannot be attempted
with safety.
... Mr. Allen Rodgers brought to the
board of trade rooms Saturday several
specimens of the products of his farm
two miles east of town. Among these
are corn stalks fourteen feet high
with fine large ears; fourteen foot
stalks of sorghum cane, samples of
splendid ribbon cane, peanuts, etc. If
there ever was a demonstration of
what can be done on a Marion county
farm the past two seasons have
brought it out, as there has been
more real farming during that period
than ever before. An the desirable
part of it all is that it has been
profitable to all who have entered
with a determination to make it so.
The lunch counter of the Ocala

footrail. That foot-rail feels very

SAFER PLACE
Jonesville Desperado Has Been Taken
by Alachua Officers to
Jacksonville
(Associated Press)
Jacksonville, August 21. Boisey
Long, the negro who was captured
after a search for him as the slayer
of Constable S. G. Wynne, which re
sulted in the lynching of five negroes
near Newberry, has been brought
here for safe k?cping.
EXCITEMENT IN ALACHUA
Events that Led Up to the Wholesale
Lynching and the Capture of
the Principal Offender
The outbreak at Jonesville in
Alachua county was probably brought
to an end by the capture of Boisy
Long, who mortally wounded Consta
ble S. G. Wynne, of Newberry, at
Long's home Friday morning. Long
went Saturday , night to the home of
"Squire" Long, an old colored preach
er, nine miles northwest of Gaines
ville. Square Long and his son very
sensibly took "Boisy" to the county
jail in Gainesville.
Wynne accompanied by Dr. Harris,
went to Long's home Friday before
daylight and put him under arrest.
Long, following the example of the
negro who shot Constable Olin at
Kendrick a couple of weeks ago,
opened fire on Wynne and Dr. Harris,
wounding them both, the former mor
tally. As Wynne fell wounded, he
fired at Long, the bullet 'taking effect
tut not enough to keep Long from
escaping. Wynne died Saturday night,
and the same night the people living
near the scene of the tragedy made a
general clean-up of all the bad char
acters in the neighborhood. One ne
gro was shot to death and five two
of them women were taken from the .
Newberry jail and hung to trees on
the picnic grounds at Newberry. The
clan of negroes in which Boisey
Long was a leader had been a great
deal of trouble to their white neigh
bors for years, and had become such
energetic thieves that the farmers in
their neighborhood had about given
up trying to raise any hogs. The ac
tion of the old negro, Squire Long, is
bringing the murderer to the Gaines
ville jail was very unusual, very sen
sible and can't be too highly com
mended. Boisy Long, when captured,
had a high-powered automatic pistol,
but had no cartridges, else he might
have done more damage.
