CMay ,31. The first news that the Ger
tmans had left the shelter of their
mine activities and fortified bases was
brought to Holland by trawlers which
reported sighting a Gei man squadron
of fifteen warships including large
loruisers. This fleet was accompanied

bnorthwest in the region of Whitebank.
The two Eritish vessels lost were
-.the Nottingham and the Falmouth.
The Germans also claim to have
;sunk a Eritish destroyer and damaged
ia 'battleship, but this is denied by

50.000,000 BUSHELS OF WHEAT
COMING FROM THE NORTHWEST
To Ee Moved to Atlantic Seaboard
Within Next Six Months.
Portland, Oregon, Aug. 20. The
ihree Northwestern states, Oregon,
"Washington and Idaho, will have 50,
iOCO.000 bushels of wheat to move to
.the Atlantic s aboard within the next
,-six months and virtually no cars are
:in sight in which to move it, accord
ing to a survey completed by local
railroad men. The railroads will be
called upon to provide about 38,500
ears, the average capacity of a car
being 1,300 bushels.
Virtually all the grain of the North
; west this year, except that needed for
.domestic consumption, will move
eastward by rail. The European war
ha.s made it economically impossible
, to lan on obtaining ships enogh to
' handle the export wheat the usual
..channel for the movement. The rail
jroads have themselves influenced the
"proposed trans-contintental haul by
reducing the rates. About 20.000.000
bushels of wheat have been sold for
delivery within the next two months.

adjacent South Texas counties on Fri
day night was placed at thirteen to
night, including nine members of the
crew of the small freighter Pilot Boy,
which foundered off the Aransas Pass
jetties.
The total dams. ge in this section of
which Corpus Christi bore the neav
lest part, was estimated at $2,000,000.
This includes devastation of a large
portion of the lower coast's cotton
crop which was ready to be .picked.
Damage at Corpus Christi was esti
mated conservatively at .$500,000.
Other losses were: Aransas Pass
$15)0,000; Rockport. $75,000: Alice,
$100,000; San Diego $50,000; Robstown

FORCE IN NORTH SEA
Allies Offensive On the
Developing.
Germans are fiercely counter-attasck
ing in an effort to retain Fleury, the
loss of which they concede. The Brit
ish report the repulse of German
counter-attacks and the capture of a
portion of trenches north of Bazentin-le-Petit.
In the east the Russians are ap
parently centering their efforts on
their new drive toward Kovel. Berlin
admits that General Brussiloff's troops
have crossed the Stokhod at one
point and Petrograd says that the
Russians have pushed on beyond the
river and captured a series of heights
cn the road to Kovel. Fierce fighting
continues on the crest of the Carpa
thians where the Russians are battling
within sight of the Hungarian plains.
No idicatiri has been iven, however,
of the strength of the forces engaged
in this region, and it is uncertain as
yet wether General Brussiloff is mak
ing a serious effort to invade Hun
gary. The offensive on the Saloniki front
is slowly developing and the fighting
is growing in intensity on the 150
mile battle line from Lake Presba to
Lake Doiran. Both siles claim mi
nor successes hut apparently no action
of first importance has occurred as
yet. An interesting feature of this
situation is the advance of Bulga
rian detachments towards the Greek
seaport of Kavala. This port is well
to the east of the allied front and the
l.ttrpose of the Bulgarian move is not
made clear in the despatches.
SHARK CIRCLED AROUND

Charles Toth of Boston Taken from
Water by His Trainers.
Boston, Aug. 20. Kenry F. Sullivan
of Ixwell was declared the winner
over Charles Toth of Boston, tonight
in an attempted swimming race be-
tween Race Point. Provincetown, and
Xantasket Reach. Toth was taken
from the water by his trainers when
a shark circled about him after he
had covered 17 1-2 miles in a little
more than 14 hours. Sullivan kept on
for 25 miles and his followers claim
ed he was in the water twenty hours,
27 minutes.
Officials said that Sullivan had es
tablished a new American endurance
record beating the mark of 15 hours
and 47 minutes set up by Toth last
year in a swim from Charlestown
bridge to Boston Bight and return.
Toth's unexpected finish was excit
ing. The Boston man had reached a
point seven miles off Brant Rock in
Massachusetts Bay about S.20 this
morning when Captain Durkey. his
trainer, and two oarsmen in Toth's
pilot boat said they saw the fin of a
shark cuttinc: the water close to the
swimmer. They shouted a warning
and Toth dove, coming up on the oth
er side of the pilot boat, to be helped
nut of the water by his assistants. T.
B. Sullivan, father of Toth s opponent,
who was in the Toth pilot boat, said
he, too, saw a dark object In the wa

did the 17 1-2 miles in 14 hours and
22 minutes. Sullivan kept on to with

his trainers decided that the tide was
too unfavorable for him to keep on.
Both men took nourishment fre
quently during the race and apparent
ly were in good condition when they
left the water.

DENIES THAT PRINCIPLE OF AR
BITRATION IS ENDANGERED
FIRM FOR ARBITRATION
Controversy Between Railroads and
Employees Has Reached a Point
Where Decisive Developments May
Be Expected Soon.
Washington, Aug. 20. President
Wilson's week of conferences with
ranking olficials of the railroads and
leaders of their employes threatening
a nation-wide strike is believed by all
parties to the controversy to have
brought the situation to a point where
decisive developments may be ex
pected within a few days.
President Replies to Officials.
While the negotiations took no ac
tual forward step today, the president
replied indirectly to contentions of the
road officials that the principle of ar
bitration would be endangered by his
plan for putting the eight hour basis
day into effect while a commission in
vestigates its practicability and pass
es upon other points at issue. In a
telegram made public at the White
House, the president declared he held
firmly to arbitration as a principle and
that his plan strengthened rather than
weakened it. He also said that some
means must be found to prevent the
existing situation from ever arising
again.
Magnates Continue Conferences.
Meantime, the road officials, who
have tentatively refused to accept Mr.
Wilson's proposal .continued Confer
ences among themselves. The labor
leaders, who already have approved
the proposal, marked time awaiting a
definite decision from the employers.
Appeal from George Pope.
The president's telegram defending
his plan was in reply to an appeal
from George Pope, president of the
National Association of Manufactur
bitration be preserved in the strike
ers, urging that, the principle of ar
negotiations. Mr. Pope's telegram fol
lows: "Hartford, Conn., Aug. IS, 1016.
"The President. The White llou.-e:
"On behalf of thirty-seven hundred
manufacturing organizations, employ
ing three million persons and utterly
dependent upon uninterrupted railroad
service for their operation, I beg at
once to express our deep appreciation
of your efforts to prevent the threat
ened stoppage of national railroad
service and to respectfully urge that
you will with all the power of your
great office and personality assert and
inaimaiu the p eiote of arbitration
for infirm-trial disputes affecting na
tional intercourse. No just demand
can fear such a test; no unfair de
