The War At a Glance
XTALIAX troops are to take part
in the important campaign just
opening in the Balkans, accord
ing to Saloniki advices today which
report the disembarkation of
Italian soldiers at that port now
in progress. German troops are
emplojed on the Macedonian front
and actual war between Germany
and Italy, of which there so far has
been no formal declaration, now
seems probable.
The Macedonian campaign itself
does not yet seem to have developed
an engagement of first rate mag
nitude, but there is pronounced ac
tivity along the 150 mile fighting
front, with successes claimed by
each side at various points.
In the Verdun region the Germans
who again lost the village of Fleury
northeast of the citadel in fighting
last week, are making determined
efforts to regain the place.
Along the Somme front, the artil
lery battle is raging violently No
infantry actions are reported by
Pans, however, although a German
counter attack apparentl is in
preparation, following the capture
by the French of a strongly forti
fied wood between Guillemont and
Maurepas northwest of Peronne.

"Water poured across the bat k yard
of Robert Townsend's home, at 22-3
Montana street, and flooded the floors
on the first floor of the home. The
rugs were ruined and the floors will
have to be refinished. The basement
at the Townsend home was filled to
the first floor level and the front and
rear yards were ruined by the water.
The flood poured through a Southwest
ern culvert just back of the Townsend
home, which is lower than the ground
to the rear of It and water covered
the entire yard. A giant Russian sun
flower, which Mrs. Townsend had been
watching with great care, was washed
out by the roots just as it had started
to bloom. Many of her other flowers
were washed away and the lawn ruined
It was one of the heaviest rains
ever seen in El Paso and tons of earth
and rocks were washed onto the streets
at every crossing below the mesa dis
trict. A heavy wind accompanied the
torrent of rain.
"Water in Street.
Many who witnessed the cloudburst
could see jrreat sheets of water float
ing down the side of Mount Franklin,
rushing upon the city. Arroyos and
canyons seemed to be full from bank
to bank. This water was deposited
upon the lower levels of the city with
tremendous force and cut the streets
to pieces, filled basements and stopped
traffic of al!sorts.
Automobiles were tied up all over tha
city, water getting into carburetors or
on magnetos and causing short circuits
as the drivers attempted to force their
way over the rocks and gravel through
the raging torrents in the streets. In
Montana street in the block west of
Rosewood, the water ran higher than
the street curbs, flowing into all the
jards.
One of the peculiar things connected
with the storm was that the sun was
shining in some parts of the city. Peo
ple down the valley say the sun could
he seen shining west of Mount Prank-
lin. while they could see the cloud on
tne east ana south side pouring the
water onto the rugged sides of the
old mountain.

ULTIMATE HOPE
Spokesman For Railroads
Says Executives Trying to
Reach Final Decision.
WASHINGTON. D. C Aug. 2L
President Wilson today reiter
ated to the railroads" execu
tives, including the new arrivals from
the west, his demand that they accept
his plan for the settlement of th
threatened railroad strike. The execu
tives then began the first of a series
of meetings in which they will frame
their reply
As the railroad presidents entered
the white house. Hale Holdea. their
spokesman, said the executives already
here had sought to maintain open
minds on the entire question, but that
after president Wilson had explained
his plan thoroughly to the new arriv
als, considerations of all questions in
volved would be begun with the ob
ject of reaching a final decision.
Stick: To Arbitration.
The railway heads spent several hours
today trying to devise some form of
settlement of the threatened strike
which would still preserve the prin
ciple of arbitration and be one which
president Wilson could prevail upon the
men to accept.
One of tie suggestions the railroad
presidents were prepared to make at
the white house was for legislation to
create a board to Investigate when
trouble threatens between railroad em
ployers and employes. The board -would
be created by act of congress.
Prevent Strike Until Report.
Pending its investigation the em
ployes would not be permitted to strike
or to take a strike vote. After the
board had reached its conclusions from
the facts, a public report would be
made and there would be opportunity
for arbitration but it would not b
compulsory.
If arbitration were refused the nn
would vote directly on the question
of a strike.
'Sat Ready for nswer.
It was understood that the railroad
executives were not yet ready to pre

president on his plan The conference;
this afternoon was arranged to allow
the officials who arrived here today
to get the president's viewpoint first
