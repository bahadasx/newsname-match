Washington, D. C, Aug. 21.
The railroad presidents and
tne committee ot managers i
worked today to devise some
means of averting the threat
ened strike, which would in
the main accept President
Wilson's plan, but at the same
time preserve the principle of
arbitration.
The leaders of the railroad
executives declare they are
united against the president's
plan as it stood and hoped to
agree on some counter pro
posal. The employes, after a brief
meeting today, adjourned un
til tomorrow, awaiting develop
ments and in the meantime sent
delegates to congress to ac
quaint them with the details
of the controversy.
The situation continues, as
both sides expressed it, serious,
but not hopeless.
Some decisive developments
are expected within the next
day or two

ATTRACT ATTENTION OF THE
TAXPAYERS FOR NEXT FEW
WEEKS.
Tlie campaign for tho permanent
mail bond issue was inaugurated Sat
urday when the petitions to the coun
ty commissioners were circulated and
many signers secured.
The committee met and organized,
with Senator Fred Tucker as chair
man. Tim committee comprises he

President Wilson I Gooree Henley, nert Simpson, I. M.

says that some means must be J ROod i)(tition fr presentation, arter
found to nrevent such a sit ill ''' committee nnd the county
tion from arising again be
tween the railroads and the
employes.
President Wilson called the
railroad presidents to the
White House again this after
noon for another. conference at
2:30. It was expected that
there would be no further move
until tomorrow, but the arrival
of a number of western rail
road presidents made the meet
ing possible.
lEKECf

li
IIS 111 CM IE,
commissioners will hold a conference
and the line of campaign mapped out.
The petitions are being circulated
among the taxpayers of the county
ami it is proposed to have such an
overwhelming sentiment in favor of
railing the election that the county
commissioners will have no excuse
for not issuing the rail.
Tho roads of the county are getting
in a deph rahle condition. The con
tinued dry weather has converted
tin in into n bed of dr.st and a rain
.did deep mud would be preferable to
existing conditions.
As soon as the election is called by
the commissioners a vigorous cam
paign will be inaugnri'ted by the
Chamber of Comemrep anil the Husi
ness Men's association to carry the
election in favor of them.

the coasts of Great Uritain. Six of them have bien shipped from iioston. All are named after various lish ol

twemy-live knots. The contracts were awarded last Kpring, ami it is said they cost $4,000 each. The boats are
very heavily constructed forward, evidently with the Idea of mounting a small gun, probably threelneh cal

or heavier oils may be us"d. The stealing gear is like that of an automobile.
