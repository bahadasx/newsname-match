General Brusiloff Shifts Drive

Makes Easy Gains Against
Weakened Line Near Kovel
My William I. BIiiuim
Petrograd, Aug. 21. By suddenly
hitting bit attack to too Btochod
river front northeast of Kovel, Gen
arl Bruelloff bat caught the Germans
off their guard and la driving wt
ward for substantial galna.
Realising that General Dothmer's
army bad been crushed the Germans
began stripping their northern front
at every aTsllable man and sending
tbem southward to derend lemberg.
"It was while this troop movement was
under way that Brusiloff struck fur
tber north with his right wing. His
flanking attack menace both Kovel
and the German army at Pinsk.
The Slavs' frontal attacks on Kovel
have ceased. The Germans have sunk
turrets In the marshy ground west of
the city. These turrets are practical
ly Invisible to Russian air scouts and
must be overcome by strategy rather
than massed Infantry onslaughts.
Consequently the line west of Kovel
a remained stationary for some

swung westward like a deadly pend
ulum from a point enst of Kovel, as
pivot. The advance was propor
tionately faster in tho extreme south.
Expert opinion here believes that
more depends upon Bruslloff's cam
paign that the mere stand or fall of
Lemberg and Kovel. Prisoners say
the northern part of Hungary Is be
ing evacuated by civilians because of
the Slav advance near Koromezo.
In Friday and Saturday's fighting
on thin front, 1,386 prisoners, one
cannon, IK machine guns and other
material were captured.

forces In the Caucasus have captured
a whole series of strongly fortified

SHOEMAKER SAVES
STEELHEAD FISHING
Carl D. Shoemaker, state game
warden, announced here this after
noon that he had Just completed tak
ing testimony In a hearing at Gold
Beach which had for Its object the
establishment of a dead line at the
mouth of the Rogue River. The
hearing lasted two days and at the
conclusion Mr. Shoemaker established
the line.
"I found that there was consider
able difference, of opinion among the
fishermen themselves as to where the
line should bo established, hut In
reaching my conclusion that the line
should be established at Doyle Rock
I took Into consideration the preser
vation of the sport of angling for
steelheads on the upper Rogue, as
well as the continuation of the com
merclal fishing Industry at the
mouth," said Mr. Shoemaker.
Mr. Shoemaker explained that
Doyle Rock Is about 1700 feet up
stream from the mouth of the river
and at that point the stream has a
width of nearly a mile. At the mouth
where fishing la varrled on the river
at low water Is lesB than 200 feet
wide. By placing the dead line at
Doyle Uock two set net locations have'
been cut out and the best seining
ground of tho McCleay company has
been taken away. The lino becomes
effective In thirty days.
"I consider this the most Important
piece of work I have accomplished
since I have been state gome warden.
It will be a great benefit to Josephine
and Jnckson county sportsmen," con
eluded Mr. Shoemaker.

GREEK CABINET IS
WORRIED BY NEW
IHH LIVE
Athens, Aug. 21, Bulgarian troops
are reported within 10 miles of the
Greek port of Kavala, In their ad
vance to attack the allies' right wing
The Greek cabinet has been called
into special session because ot the
Bulgarian advance Into Greek terri
tory, Generals Moschopoulos, Sottills
and Gbenadis attending the confer
ence. Kavala, a port of 5,000 population,
was taken from Turkey by Greece in
the Balkan wars. It lies 18 miles
west ot the Bulgarian border, and
has long been coveted by the Bul
gars. The government Is watching the
Bulgarian invasion of Greek terri
tory with the greatest Interest. The
newspaper Patris says the cabinet
thus far has reached no decision and
will await farther developments.
From the military standpoint the Bul
garian advance Is considered unim
portant, so far as the allies are con
cerned. The Bnlgars apparently are
trying to seize strategic positions on
the allied flanks, from which to de
liver attacks when the expected allied
offensive begins. '
The British and French ministers
conferred with Premier Zamasls to
day, who Immediately afterward
summoned the chief of staff ot the
Greek army. - The discussion turned
to the question of withdrawing por
tions ot the Greek army and civilians
from the territory occupied by the
Bnlgars. ' v";
BRITISH LOSE TWO"
London, Aug. 21. The sinking ot
two such valuable light cruisers as
the Falmouth and Nottingham Sat
urday in the first North Sea naval
fight since the Jutland battle, Is
"distinctly unfortunate," the naval
expert of the Dally News asserted to
day, "but it Is the penalty that must
be paid by a fleet commanding the
seas."
"In the Dodger-bank fight last
year and on several less important
occasions, the enemy tried to lure
the British force's Into a submarine
trap," said the News' expert, "but
although our pursuing ships often
found themselves in a nest ot U boats,
they never before suffered loss there
from." THREE FATALLY HURT

railroad presidents, representing th '

were in conference here late this
afternoon forming the final answer
they will make to the proposals ad
vanced by President Wilson 1a an ef
fort to avert a strike that wonld par

The heads of the great systems went
into secret session after hearing an
impassioned appeal by President Wll-
on to "keep the railroads running.
tot only in the Interest of this coun
try, but in order to meet the demands
ct the entire world." - ,.
President Wilson made the railroad
presidents a 30-mlnute address dar
ing the White House meeting. The
heads of the systems walked or rode
through a blistering heat front their
hotels to the White House to hear the
chief executive's final appeal. r
rresiaeni wuson ouuraea to them,
the need for railroad cooperation In
the Interest of preparedness as one
point in the broader (round It took.
It had been learned earlier in tho
day of reports from the :. treasury,
and agricultural departments that a
strike wonld mean the loss of mil
lions of dollars in crops. But the
president vent even beyond the do
mestic situation, when he told tho
railroad heads that not only In this
country but abroad "where the people
of all the belligerent nations are look
ing to the United States," the co
operation of the big railroad systems
is absolutely essential.
"I am willing to allow the case
to go to the great American Jury
and let them assess the responsibil
ity," said President Wilson to the rail
way presidents. "I wish you to con
sider the consequences of a failure to
agree as they may affect the people
ot the great cities and the country
side. The country cannot live if the
means of keeping alive its vitality are
interfered with.
"The lives and fortunes of 100,
000,000 men. women and little ones,
some of whom may die, depend on
what may be done In this room. I
leave the matter to you.
"I appeal to you as one American
citizen to another, to avoid hls dis

Washington, Aug. 21. Arrival of
the western railroads presidents and
receipts of hundreds of telegrams
from commercial organizations were
the feature of the first day of the
second week of the president's Inter
vention between the railroads and the
four brotherhoods. The presidents
came at President Wilson's invitation
and the telegrams In part, at least,
at the invitation of the railroads.
Railroad executives here made no
secret of the fact that they were lin
ing up all possible business support
for their arbitration contention.
The president made his answer
known In reply to one of these tele
grams, that from George Pope, presi
dent of the National Association ot
Manufacturers. Pope declared 8,700
manufacturing organizations, em
ploying millions of men, are utterly
dependent on un-lnterrupted railway
service. iHe urged the president to
prevent the threatened stoppage ot
train service and at the same time
to maintain the principle of the open
hop. . . . .
