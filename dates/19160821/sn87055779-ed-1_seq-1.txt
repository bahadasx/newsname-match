Ch.irk'H F. Stielow, convicted of
murdering Charles 15. I'helps and J
Margaret Woleott, took a new turn',
today when counsel for the con

at Kochest er.
The governor was requested to ;.p-
point an unprejudiced district at- i

The hearing at Rochester was or
dered by Jov. Whitman for the pur
pose of having John Knickerbocker
show cause why Stielow should not
have a new trial owing to newly dis
covered evidence. The new evidence
was a confession by Irving King that
cleared Stielow of the crime, hut this
was later repudiated by King.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 21. The
senate began debate today on the
emergency revenue bill, designed to
raise $205.000.000 to fill the de
pleted treasury, and entered upon
what may prove to be the last wvek
of the congressional session.
The revenue bill is the last big
measure on this session's legislative
program and. unless too much op
position develops on he democratic
side, leaders on both sides were
hopeful of adjournment next Satur
day. The republicans will take three
days to record their opposition, but
will make no effort to delay passage
of the bill. Sen. Penrose. Smcot.
talliner. Harding. Curtis and Sher
man will present the republican
arguments against the measure.
Insurgents l'lan Fight.
Despite the caucus endorsement of
the bill, democratic leaders did not
conceal their fear that the real Tight
ogainst the bill would be made by
insurgents on their own side. Sen.
Fnderwood of Alabama, author of
the Fnderwood tariff, has1 given no
tice of his intention of iitxhtintr the
tariff commission provision of the
bill. Sen. l'helan of California, vvill
make a determined Hebt airainst the
wine tax. while Sen. I Mttman of Xc-
vaila. will lead the opposition to cer
tain features of the munitions tax.
Sen. Thumas of Colorado, will op
pose the proposed 1 ."'". 0. Oon bond

Seek to Withhold
Three Million Due
For Canal Rights
Intern. Unna l News Servbe:
WASHINGTON'. Aug. L'l. Pres
sure is being brought to bear on the
stale department to withhold pay
ment of the $3.000.000 due the
Nicaragua government for the
canal rights and the Konvoa bay
naval station. OHieials hero hive
Itien assured that the a Iministra
tion in Nicaragua has given its en: -pioyes
notes in payment for their
services, and that oMicials of the
government have discounted them at
half their v alue. The ex pent d
American payment would bo divert
ed largely to these ol'icials to satisfy
the nttes thev hold. It is expected
that the state department vv ih with-!
hold payment of the money until ,
after the installation of a i?a aü-j
ministration.
The .situation has beer further
complicated by a protest from Sal
vador lod'-ed with the Iatin-Ameri-can
international court against sell
ing the United States islands in Fon
seca bay for th'j establishment of a
coaling station. In this protest, it
is pointed out. that Salvador is one
of the countries exercising a joint
control over Fonseca hay. and that
Nicaragua has not the right to dis
pose of any part of it without the
consent of the other countries; inter
ested. according to the terms of an
existing agreement.

IctematiOii.il News Service:
NEW YORK. Aug. 21. I "enun
ciation of lax divorce laws and the
growth of radicalism in America
formed two leading features of the
report of the national comrnitte on
public morals presented today at
the lüth annual convention of the
Americar FNtivrv'i' r. of Catholic
Societies. n'ho r it was presented
. - t :
by Kdwj.rd -'eency. iv.. .
I'r.ioklvn chairman jf the
tee.
After calling attention to the fact
that moie than l.i.-'Hi.euu divorces
have been gr-Aiited during the last
lu yc-ars "ny American courts
thc fact that federal efforls to
cure : liiiiform divorce law-
failed, the report says:
"We can only repeat denunciation
of pagan state laws that make easy
the separation of what Clod his
joined together, and renew our de
mand for a national law so string
ent that no longer shall the tinker
of scorn be pointed at the United
States as second only to Japan in
the number of divorces granted to
people of doubtful morality."
Donounoes Il:ulical.
Dealing with radical sociology,
the report says:
"The sociologist is poisoning the
wells of oublle morality by the ad
vocacy of birth control, sex hygiene,
regulation by the state of mariaue
on an animal plane, rejection of the
wedding of men and women through
Clod's minister.. The next move of
the new philosophers may be to do
nvvay with the old rite of matrimony
and gro the limit, with a civil magis
trate's certificate, to protect these
with property interests and free
Jove for the proletariat, the state
to care f ir the children.
The report characterizes the radi
cal a.s a tireless worker, who turns
to the unorganized ranks of labor
when he tinds his efforts rejected
by the thoughtful trade unionists.
In his c.de of materialism and class
hatred, says the report, there is no
Toom for morality of the Christian
code..

The work of the radicals in Mexi

"Tons of anarchistic literature
sent across the Itio (Irande during
the past live years, for which the

go to the white house.

The insistence of the president
upon imediate conference b-d to th
conclusion that he had determined
to force the issue. Word wa.s
abroad in Washington that the rep
resentatives of the four railway
brotherhoods presenting the strike
demands had become impatient and
that strike orders had already been
drawn and awaited "only si-natures
to be issued. Pressure from the men
for immediate action no t with a de
termined atmosphere of delay among

so far as they were concerned the
conference would develop noihin-.-.
They declared that they would oik e
more listen to the president's pn

on the coru4deration of the. proposal
by the railroids. but white house of

was merely to "talk things over''
