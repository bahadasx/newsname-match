AUTOISTS
GET THEIRS
IN COURT
Sammy Dwyer Makes Roundup ofDrivers
for Jay Riding, Culling Corners and
Passing Halted Sireet Cars
Notwithstanding the warning which
was issued to the public when Sammy
Dwyer, the motorcycle cop, got on the
trail, many auto drivers have fallen
into his grasp since Saturday after
noon and this morning's session of
the police court was an active one.
And Sammy is still on the job.
Local auto drivers were under the
impression that only speeders would
be made the victims of the special offi
cer's vigilance and were caught off
their guard while violating other parts
of traffic regulations. Passing street
cars while the latter were discharging
passengers and jay driving, that is cut
ting streets and street corners, made
the drivers liable to arrest and fin:
and no favoritism is being shown,
either by the cop or by Mayor Coff
man. One arrest was made by regu
lar officers.
The following drivers of cars were
arrested by Dwyer Saturday evening
and Sunday: S. S.Green, jay driving
between Third and Fourth streets on
Chickasha avenue; John Trevino, ser
vice car man, jay driving on Sixth and
Chickasha on Saturday afternoon, for
feited $5 bond; Mrs, Arthur Barry, jay
driving on Sixth and Chickasha, will
be tried at 4 o'clock today; Harry

Nation-Wide Tieup Would Play Havoc

Hold Separate Meetings to Discuss Situa

Public Opinion
By United Press.
Washington, August 21, The loss of
millions of dollars in crops throughout
the country in the event of a railroad
strike is a new possibility that has
arisen before the administration. The
treasury department reports that
agents of the federal reserve board in
the southwest and the northwest are
beginning to ask for funds for their
annual "crop moving" period. A tieup
of the railroads would mean that the
products which are now ready for tho
mills would be held up indefinitely and
would probably rot besides the track.
The loss to producers on perishable
commodities would bo so great that
an approximation would be impossi
ble, department of agriculture officials

LEAP TO
CREEK BED
Driver of Ford Plunges Through Bridge
Side When Steering Ceer
Refused to Work
Plunging through the railing of a
bridge and (lashing bead foremost
about sixteen feet Into a dry creek bo
low while at the wheel of a Ford,
Louis Nelson, a farmer living near
Norge, was the. victim of an accident
yesterday about noon.
The car belonged to Mr. Clark of the
same vicinity who was taking his fam
ily to Norge. Mr. Clark had run the
car into a ditch -while approaching the
bridge, but as he had purchased It
only a few days before and was a new
driver, he credited the accident to his
carelessness. He called on Mr. Nelson
for help and after the latter had pull
ed him out of the ditch with a team of
mules he offered to run the anto
across the bridge, as he was an expe
rienced driver. When near the mid
dle of the bridge the steering wheel
again refused to work, resulting in
the terrifying accident.
Nelson was caught beneath the steer
ing wheel and w hen found w as uncon
scious, but had presence of mind to
turn off the engine as the car made
the plunge. He was bruised about the
head and was partly unconscious
throughout the remainder of the day.
No bones were broken, the shock to
the brain being the only serious ef
fect. Nelson was the only one in the car,
the Clark family having waited to
walk across the bridge, but one little
boy had stood on the fender of the
car, until the very moment of the ae
ciilent. Strangely enough, the car was not
badly demolished.

Mrs. L. C. Wright, After Being Thrown
From Car, is Buried Under Wreck
age and Badly Hurt
MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
OF OCCUPANTS
Mr. Wright Slows Up at Bad Crossing
Then Shoots Car Ahead When He
Sees Approaching Train
What proved to be a miraculous ess
cape from instant death resulted in
the injury of Mrs. L. C. Wrlghr of this
city to an extent which, owing to pre
vailing conditions, cannot as yet be
determined. That Mr. Wright and
their five months old baby escaped
painful or even fatal injuries is not
loss marvelous.
On the way to Alex on a pleasure
jaunt the Chickasha family was struck
by a passenger train on the Lindsay
division. After being extricated from
tho wreck they came in on the regular
passenger train, Mrs. Wright being ta
ken to the Chickasha hospital for med
ical aid. Hero it was learned that as
a result of being thrown under the de
molished car she sustained bad bruis
es oil the right side of the head, lu
her back and lower extremities and in
hor chest. Physicians do not consid
er hor condition to be in any way se
rious but its gravity cannot be deter
mined until it is learned whether she
is internal. y injured.
The baby suffered slight bruises and
Is only at the hospital to be with its
mother.
How Accident Occurred.
The accident happened about J0:2U
Sunday morning at 'the first crossiug
west of tho Alex station. Mr. Wright
says he. drove his car, a Buick five
passenger, onto the track before he
saw the approaching train to which
his wife called attention. There is a
sharp ascent to the track, he says, and
in order to avoid a bump he slowed up
his engine to take the grade easily.
Tho engine of the eastbound train was
near at hand whou ho saw it. He real
ized that it was too late to reverse his
engine, the front part of the car be
ing already on tho track, and hence he
"gave it the juico" in an effort to get
across in time. Realizing tho danger
of a collision, Mr. Wright had called
to his wife, who was In the rear seat,
to hand him tho baby and Jump, but
either she did not hear him or failed
In tho excitement to take In the situa
tion. He thinks it likely that she had
tainted.
Mrs. Wrlflht Under Wreckafle.
The locomotive struck the rear end
of the auto, demolishing it. Mrs.
Wright was pinned beneath the wreck

her face on the ground. The baby wa
picked up fifty-seven feet from the
scene of the crash, lying on the ground
with Its face in the dirt Mrs. Writ-lit

Wright escaped without injury of con
sequence. He says at the place where
the accident occurred, it was difficult
to see an approaching train and that
the train gave no warning.
The claim agent of the Rock Island
took photographs of the locality where
the collision occurred.

Santiago, Chile, Aug. 21. The Chil

action against the British blacklist.
Prominent business men complain that;
the blacklist will cripple the trade

(By Charles P. Stewart. United Prcs

Buenos Aires, Argentine, Aug. 21. ,
South Americans resent tha Britisli
blacklist as much as tho LVted States
does.
There is today pronounced ill feel.
Ing between the Buenos Aires Com
morcial and Corn Exchanges and Ui
Brltinh government.
Early ill the war the authorities iri
London began issuing lists of German
concerns in foreign countries, Argen
Una Included, with which Englishmen
In the samo countries were forbidden
to have business relations. These
lists have beou added to from time to
time.
The two big Uuenoa Aires exchange
ea took official uotlce of this Bltnalioiu.
to the extent of recognising that tho
British and German Interests in que:n
tion could not meet ou a coiumou loot
Ing.
This was an embarrassment to ILo
Germans and a convenience to the En
glish, inasmuch as It obviated com
plications in transactions which Inter
mediately or Incidentally Involved An
gentino and numerous other foreign
bouses In transactions It might bava
boon difficult, otherwise to have Iden
tified as of a distinctly Anglo-Gcrmaa
character.
In the last few weeks, however, thq
British government has observed that
companies of friendly alien origin fre
quently do business, on one Bide wltli
German ar.d on the other with British,
companies. An order was according
ly Issued from London placing all uucfe
establishments on the blacklist.
The Buenos Aires Commercial and
Corn Exchanges have gone formally
on record as recognizing no such man
date. The result will be piaetically to
nullify the British- blacklist In Argen- ,
tine, except tn the cases of the British
houses that are disposed to respect it
voluntarily. Even the ones in thl3 lat
ter class can hardly respect their gov
ernment's order without mining their
business, as they have now no longer
any guarantee that they will not b
trading indirectly with Germans.
