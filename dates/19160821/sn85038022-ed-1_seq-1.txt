THE HOG QUESTION
Anrned In Police Cnnrt Satnrday Na
Derision Reached :i- Vet and the
Case In Being Tried at
Pre Time.
The caae of M. ('. Hutchiaon, chanted
with tiialntalning a nulsam-e. wan fetal
l:i Police Court Saturday.
The caae waa opened at W o'clock In
the mornlnR and the city Introduced
the evidence of Mr. Frank Clark, the
president of the Hoard of Health. Mr.
Clark stated that he had visited the
p rem i boh of Mr. Hutchison but had
not made any personal Inspection of
the pen. He said that there was a very
distinct odor of a hog pen from where
ho stood, about twenty feet from tin'
pen. He said that he did not know the
number of hogs In the pen. He said
that he had Issued a notice to Mr.
Hutchison that the pens were a nuis
ance but that he had refused to remedy
he evil.
Mr. Thomas P. Boono waa also in
troduced by the city but his evidence
was very meager.
Mr. A. D. Cole, the attorney for the
defendant, then made his argument
asking that the case be dismissed as
the Board of Health bad seemingly
taken a judicial power in their hands.
He argued that this was unconstitu
tional and cited several Instances in
support of his argument.
City Attorney Calhoun made clear in
his argument that the case was being
tried, not for an lnfrlngment of an
order of the Board of Health but for
maintaining a nuisance. He was up
held by Judge Whitaker.
The court then adjourned to meet at
3 o'clock and during thlB time the
Board again visited the bog pen. At
the ppenlng of the court Dr. Yuell,
the health officer, slated that the pen
whs unsanitary, as were all such In-
rlosures.
The defense then argMed that the
in it I..- had been signed only by one
nu mber of the Board of Health. Mr.
Clark stated he had been authorised to
si r n the notice by the other memoers
I of the board, Mr. Verner Dryden and
Mr. Hall Strode. The defense attempt
ed to prove that Mr. Dryden had not
given his consent but aa be
,u not there, Mr. Cole asked that the
trial be postponed until this morning
to get the evidence of Mr. Dryden. The
court was postponed until this morn
ing at 9 o'clock. At press time we
ould not learn of the result of the
case.

DEVELOPMENTS
Are Expected Within a Few Hays Id
lUllroad Strike Situation Presi
dent Wilson's Week of Confer
enres Is Believed to Have
Brought Controversy
to This Point.
Washington, August 20 President
Wilson's week of conferences with
ranking officials of the railroads and
leaders of their employes threatening
a nation-wide strike, are believed by
all parties to the controversy to have
brought the situation to a point where
decisive developments may be expect
ed within a few days. While the ne
gotiations took no actual forward step
today, the President replied indirectly
to contentions of the road officials, that
tho principles of arbitration would be
endangered by his plan for putting an
eight-hour working day Into effect,
while u commission investigates its
practicability and passes on other
points at issue.
In a telegram made public at the
White House the President declared
he held firmly to arbitration as a
principle and that his plan strength
ened rather than weakened it. He
said also that some means must be
found to prevent the existing situa
tion from arising again.
Road Officials Still Confer
Meantime the road officials, who
have tentatively refused to accept
Mr. Wilson's proposal, continued con
ferences among themselves. The la
bor leaders, who already have ap
proved the prospoeal, marked time
awaiting a definite decision from the
employers.
The President's telegram defending
his plan was in reply to an appeal
from Ueorge Pope, president of the
National Association of Manufac
turers urging that the principles o(
arbitration be preserved in the strike
negotiations.
There wore no outward develop
ments today pending arrival of the
additional railroad executives to whom
the President sent invitations yester
day. Louis W. Hill, president of the
Ureat Northern aud several other
western railroads, and others are ex
pected at iilght. Representatives of
both sides are prepared to remain here
until the final word is bpukeu ui.d a
strike declared or averted.
President Wilson made no engage
ments for tomorrow In order to be
ready to continue negotiations with
the railroad presidents, but It was
thought probable there would be no
further general White House confer
ences until Tuesday. Although the
railroad executives continued to main
tain their position in opposition to the
President's plan and in favor of arbi
tration, administration officials ex
pressed hope that ultimately they
would decide to negotiate on the
basis proposed by Mr. Wilson.
Counter Proposals Expected
It was understood tonight that a
counter proposal waa under considera
tion by the railroad executives, but
that It had not yet reached a definite
stage. It was said to Include arbitra
tion of at least some of the points at
issue, with the grautlug of others.
In the meantime telegrams urging
the President to Insist on arbitration
arrived in large numbers at the White
House. Most of them were sent by
business men aud firms and organisa
tions. HAYKM TRIAL TODAY
The trial of Kred llayea. charged
with obtaining money under falsa pre
