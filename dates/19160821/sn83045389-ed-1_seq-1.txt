There were no outward developments
to-day pending arrival of the additional
railroad executives to whom the l'resi
lent sent invitations yesterday Sev
?ral Western tail road presidents will
trrive to-morrow. Representatives of
both sides are prepared to remain hero
until the final word is spoken and a
strike declared or averted.
president Wilson made no engage
ments for to-morrow, in order to lie
ready to continue negotiations with
the railroad presidents, birr it was
thought probable that there would be
no further general White House con
ference until Tuesday. Although the
railroad executives continue to main
tain their position in opposition to the
President's plan and in favor of arbi
tration, administration officials ex
press hope that ultimately they would
decidf to negotiato oil tiie basis pro
posed by Mr. Wilson. It was under
stood to-nlglit that a counterproposal
was under consideration by the. rail
road executives, but that it had not
yet reached a definite stage. It was
said to include arbitration of at least
some of the points at Issue, with tho
granting of others. Tn the meantime
telegrams urging the President to in
sist on arbitration arrived in large
numbers at the White House. Most of
them were sent by business men anil
fis'lis and ot ganiations. Copies of
many were sent to the railroad execu
tives. Administration officials said
the telegrams would have no effect on
the President, since he had tried to
bring about arbitration, bad failed and
had no way of forcing it.

Incident of the last Zeppelin raid over

arrived here on the American liner
St. Paul.
The Jersey Idly has a home nt Kent
ford, about four miles from New
market, in Suffolk, the racing head
quarters of Kngland.
"On the night of August 7," she said,
"we heard a loud rattling noise outside.
The maid went out and returned a mo
ment later crying: ''There's a Zeppe
lin outside.*
"I told iter she had Zeppelins on tho
brain.
"Nevertheless, we all went out. and
there saw a huge Zeppelin which ap
peared to be badly on fire. It was
blazing at one end and was slowly
risJng into the sky in a Jerky manner.
It gradually disappeared.
"This was one of the Zeppelins which
did not reach its home base."
Mrs. l.angtry is on her way to San
Francisco to appear in vaudeville in

of the country ajid return to this

Yesterday afternoon the iiritish guns'
were pounding away as usual at this'
, sector, which is called the Leipzig re
doubt. when the British, thanks to a
new system of taking care of machine
guns and a quick burst of artillery
preparation covering their charge, ap
peared at the Jump at the doors of
the dugouts. Through glasses they
were visible to observers, running
about the maze of traverses like tor
1 riers searching for rat holes, their bay
onets gleaming and puffs of smoke ris
i ing as they threw bombs.
In one capacious dugout, equipped
with beds, tables and cupboards, six
officers and 170 men surrendered in a
body, and were marched out much af
ter the manner of a crowd caught in
a gambling Jymse that had been pulled
by the police.
Some managed to escape from the
dugouts by the underground galleries.
Others, who could not escape, though
surrounded tried to man their machine
cuns a nd were s'lot down. Others
fought to the death with bayonets and
bombs.
In all. it is estimated '-'.000 Germans,
caught in this trap b> loss Ihuit their
I own numbers, were accounted for.
When tiic correspondent left the corps

Germans hail been brought in as pris

last of small parties which held out
with the ring ?>f British around them

They had hoped for a counterattack to

They looked well fed, and they showed

British Admiralty Admits
Loss of Ships While
Searching for E nemy's
High Seas Fleet.
LUXDO.V, August 21.?The Herman
high seas Moot has again appeared in
Hie North Sea. and in a clash between
'ionium submarines and British scout
ships, two Uritish light cruisers have
been sent to the botto'm. Reports are
that one of the submarines was de
stroyed, and that another was rammed
and possibly souk.
This is the first appearance in the
North Sea of strong Herman naval
forces since the battle of Jutland on
May 31. The tirst news that the Her
mans had left the shelter of their mine
fields and fortified bases was brought
to Holland by trawlers, which reported
sighting a Herman squadron of fifteen
warships, including large cruisers.
This Meot was accompanied by two
Zeppelins, and was steering northwest,
in the region of White Hank.
The two vessels lost wor* i'ne Not
tingham <5,400 tons) and the Fal
mouth <5.250 tons). The crews of both
the ships were saved, with the excep
tion of thirty-nine men. The tier
mans also claim to have sunk a British
destroyer and damaged a battleship,
but this is denied by the Admiralty.
According to the Admiralty, the tier
man floet avoided an engagement with
the main British forces, and returned
to port when Its scouts reported the
approach of strong Uritisli squadrons.

On Tuesday evening the Virginia
cast anchor at the rendezvous In Har
denier'8 Bay. The Pennsylvania wafc
already at anchor for a short stay,
proud in her super-Dreadnought su
premacy.
On Wednesday morning the real work
began. Squads were detailed to man
the bij- guns. Later there was boat
drill and in the afternoon classes were
formed for practical and theoretical In
struction.
A full crew from among the civilians
reported for each big gun.
Kfficlency demands that under war
conditions they fire three shots
a minute. It took the civilian crew
just five minutes from hoist away to
"fire."
For boat drill the rookies were di
vided Into regular full crews. Among
the rookies are half of Harvard's first
crew men, who rowed Vale off the
water last June.
On Wednesday afternoon classes
were formed in navigation, seamanship,
and half a dozen other subjects. Kaeh
recruit had an opportunity to choose
his specialty. By Thursday afternoon
everything was in order. Kadi man
had his lesson assigned to him. That
morning mora great ships of the fleet
had come steaming in the bay. The
New Jersey, Rhode Island and Alabama
came in battle formation, followed by
the Kentucky, Maine, Louisiana and
Kearsargo. till the bay was lined with
the big ships.
They are nien-of-war's men. They
rise at 5 o'clock to the bo's'n's pipe,
tumbling out of their hammocks six
feet to the floor. They lash their ham
mocks with the required lynnibor of
stitches, roll up their broad-legged
sailor pants to the knee and swab dowh
the dceks with cold sea water.
After cleaning comes breakfast, and
after breakfast assembly. From that to
general practice, they go immediately
then to boat drill, to classes of spe
cial Instruction, to torpedo-defense sta
tions, taking barely time for a bite of
dinner in between. From morning to

are displaying a remarkable quickness

ern front the French continue to press
forward in the neighborhood of Guille

of a strongly fortified wood between
that town and Maurcpas.
In the Verdun sector the'Germans
are fiercely counterattacking in an
effort to regain Fleury, the loss of which
they concede. The British report the
repulse of German counterattacks, and
the capture of a portion of trenches
north of Ra7.cntlii-lc-Pclit.
In the east \he Russians are ap
parently centering their efforts on
their new drive toward Kovel. Berlin
admits that General Brussiloff's troops
have crossed the Ktokhod at one point,
and Petrograd says that the Russians
base pushed on beyond tin- river and
l captured a series of heights on the
I road to Kovel.
I Fierce lighting continues on the crest
of the Carpathians, where the1 Rus
sians are battling within sight of the
Hungarian plains. No indication has
heeti given, however, of the strength
of the forces encaged in this region,
and it is uncertain as yet whether
general Brlissiloff is making a serious
effort to invade Hungary.
