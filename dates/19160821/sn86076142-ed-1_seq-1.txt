RUNNING AT PRESENT0 TIME
Presidents Urged to Accept
Eight Hour Day and Defer
Arbitration to Future
(Br Aaaoc((rl Prraa.l
WASHINGTON, August 21 Presi
dent Wilson reiterated to the railroad
executives, Including those, arriving
today, hid demand that they accept
his plan of settlement for the threat
ened railroad strike. The executives
then began the first of a series of
meetings wherein they will frame a
reply.
The president reinforced his previ
ous argument by pointing out that
the railroads play an important part
in the military preparedness of the
country, as they are a vital part of
the Industrial framework of the na
tion and it was absolutely necessary
to keep them running at the present
time. He told the railroads he did
not blame them in fighting for the
principle of arbitration, but believed
that under the present circumstances
they should accept the eight hour
day, leaving the working out of the
principle of arbitration until later.
The executives who had not entered
Into argument with the ' president
afterwards said they were deeply Im
pressed and would give full weight
to his argument at their conference.
As they left the White House their
spokesman said there was no change
in the situation and that the railroad
officers would meet In executive ses
sion immediately in an effort to reach
a decision.
The president declared he agreed
with the executives, believing In the
arbitration of Industrial disputes, but
in view of the fact that the railroad
employes refused to accept arbitra
tion it was Impracticable to jJiBcuss
the issue at present. He urged the
executives and their managers in the
meetings to consider the disaster
which would follow a strike.
With all the world in a measure
depending on the products of the
United States, he said, it would be a
catastrophe for the railroad system of
the United States to be tied up. He
said that in working for preparedness
in the United States the work of the
railroads played an Important part in
his considerations and that all the
plans of the government for prepar
edness would be thrown away by a
strike. On this ground he appealed
to the patriotism of the employers.

(Br Aaaorlatrd Prraa.)
LONDON, August 21. The German high sens licet has appeared
again in the North Sea and a clash between German submarines and
Kritwh scout ships caused two British light cruisers to be sent to
the bottom.
On the western front the French continue to press forward in
the neighborhood of tiuilleinont, and Paris reports the capture of a
ftrongly fortified wood between that town and Maurepas. In the
Verdun sector the Germans are fiercely counter attacking in an
effort to regain Fleury. The British report the repulse of German
counter attacks and the capture of n portion of trendies north of
Haw-min le Petit.
In the east the Russian's are apparently centering their effort on
their new drive toward Kovel. Merlin admils that Gen. Hrussiloff's
troops have crossed the Slokhod at one point and Petrograd says
that the Russians have pushed on beyond the river ami captured a
part of the heitrhts on the road to Kovel. Fierce fighting continues
on the crest of the Carpathians, where the Russians are battling
within sight of the Hungarian plains. No indication has been given,
however, of the strength of the furious engagements in this region
and it is uncertain as yet whether Gen. Brussiloff is making a serious
effort to evade Hungary.
