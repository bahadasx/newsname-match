Senate Votes 27 to 24 to Take
Measure For Passage.
Washington, Aug, 21.—By a vote of
27 to 24 the senate today voted to take
up the immigration bill which the
democratic caucus had determined to
postpone until the next session.
When debate on the provision relat
ing to Asiatics ~wad- begun galleries
were cleared and consideration of
those features proceeded in secret.
Passage of the hill seemed assured by
today's action. President Wilson ve
toed the bill last year because of ttie
literacy test.

it still retains the Tlteracy feature.

Presidents and Managers of
Lines Seek to Preserve
Arbitration.
SEEKING WAY TO
AVERT BIG STRIKE
Ready to Make Conceseione Provided
Principle of Arbitration Can be Pre­
served—Accuse President Wilson of
Surrendering Entirely to Labor
Unions—White House Stand Angers
Railway Heads.
Washington, Aug. 21.—President
Wilson today reiterated to the rail
road executives, including the new
arrivals from the west, his demand
that they accept his plan for the
settlement of the threatened strike.
The executives then began the first
of a series of meetings in which
they will frame their reply.
Washington, Aug. 21. Railroad
presidents and their -committee of
managers worked steadily today to de
vise some means of averting the
threatened strike, under which they
would in the main accept President
Wilson's plan but at the same time
preserve the principle of arbitration.
The managers declared they were
united against the president's plan as
it stands. They are considering under
what circumstances they could find a
way for the acceptance of the eight
hour basis and still preserve the prin
ciple of arbitration.
Western presidents arriving today
seemed to believe a way could be
found to avert a strike.
Summoned to White House.
The m?n, after a brief meeting to
day, adjourned to meet again tomor
row and in the meantime sent dele
gates to congressmen to explain to
them the situation. The situation was
expressed by both sides as serious but
not hopeless.
President Wilson, toward noon, sent
word to the railway presidents who are
now here asking them to call on him
at the White House at 2 o'clock this
afternoon. The presidents, who weep,
discussing the situ&tlon, agreed" to
confer with the president, but it was
said they Ttrould mako no statement
unless he requested it*
Wilson Defends Stand
That President Wilson is determined
to force the railroads into compliance
with his demand for the grant of the
eight-hour day and increased wages
to their 400.000 train operating em
ployes was evidenced by developments
at the White" House.
In a telegram to President George
Pope, of 'the National Association of
Manufacturers, Mr. Wilson den led. the
charge of the railroad executives "that
he has abandoned the principle of ar
bitration and given a setback to the
progressive movement for the pacific
settlement of wage disputes.
The president defends his plan for
the settlement of the pending contro
versy, asserting that it strengthens the
principle of arbitration and constitutes
the first step In the direction of estab
lishing a "permanent basis of arbitra
tion."
Mr. Wilson argues that Inasmuch as
there exists no governmental means of
enforcing arbitration of the contro
versy between the railroads and their
employes his plan offers the most
feasible means of averting the threat
ened strike.
Not to Modify Demande.
The utterances of the president in
his communication to Mr. Pope,are re
garded not only as a defense against
the criticism of his action voiced by
the railroad executives in their public
statement yesterday, but as a decla
ration that he will not modify his de
mands which were formulated with
the approval of the union leaders.
There Is in the president's telegram
to Mr. Pope a hint that he will under
take to obtain legislation providing for
compulsory arbitration. He will take
no step of this character, however, in
connection with the present contro
versy, and it is practically certain he
will make no move in this direction
until after the election.
Rail Chiefs' Anger Arises.
The railroad executives are indig
nant at the attitude of the president,
who, they believe, has gone over to
the side of the unions completely and
Is prepared to use every ounce of his
vast power to impose the employes'
terms upon the carriers.
The disclosure that the president
contemplates seeking legislation au
thorizing him to seize and operate the
railroads in order to avert a strike has
Increased the anger of the railway
executives. It transpired today -that
they got wind of the president's plan
several days ago and have been dis
cussing the matter in their own con
ferences.
May Call Wileon Bluff.
The carriers do not believe the
president seriously intends to attempt
such drastic action, which they are
confident would elicit a storm of dis
approval from the country at large.
They think that the president is
bluffing, that he woufc not go further
than threaten to seize the roads In the
event the executives return a definite
rejection of his settlement plan.
The railway officials say that If the
president does threaten to go to con
gress for authority to operate the rail
roads they will tell him to go as far
as he likes. They believe thpt the
action would arouse the millions of
stockholders In the railroads and that
congress would respond to' the storm
of objection with a refusal to pass thi
proposed legislation.

_L
House was for legislation to create a
board to investigate when trouble
threatened between railroad employers
and employes. The board would be
created by an net of congress. Pend
ing its investigation the employes would
not be. permitted to strike or to take
a strike vote. After the board had
reached Its conclusions from the facts
a public report would be made. If ar

then vote "directly on the question of a

IOWA COAL PRICES
HIT BY DECISION
Interstate Commerce Commission Re
fuses to Suspend Order Reducing
Rate From Illinois 65 Cents Per Ton—
Iowa Business Damaged.
Special to Times-Republican.
Washington, Aug 21.—Refusing to
suspend the 65 cent reduction In coal
rates on the Alton from the Springfield
district mines, the interstate commis
sion took a step which Iowa operators
say will damage their business and
throw thousands out of employment.
Senator Kenyon was advised the reduc
tion would become effective at mid
night.
The present rate la $1.90 per ton on
slack coal and the rate effective tonight
will be $1.25. Railroads transporting
coal from the fields in Iowa, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Kansas opposed the re
duction on the ground that they could
not compete with the Illinois coal un
der the new rates because coal can be
mined cheaper in Illinois than In those
states.
The commission's, decision does not
affect the right of shippers to complain
against the new rate if they believe It
unjust.

DEAL NEGOTIATED BY

Japan Believed to be Anxious to Se­

cession Secured Thru Ramon Val-

Panama and Whose Election United
States May Dispute.
Washington, Aug. 21.—Investigation
of reports from Panama that a 60,000
acre land concession at the Atlantic end
of the canal is being sought by a Span
lard named Fernandez, presumably for
Japanese interests, was ordered today
by Secretary Lansing.
Rumors of a slfnllar nature have been
common since the canal was well under
way, but it was not until several months
ago that they reached a well-defined
outline. At that time it was believed
that private Japanese shipping Interests
were seeking land thru Spanish Inter
mediaries, to establish a base for stor
ing coal at lower rates thun could be
had on the American government bases.
So far as Is known nothing came of It at
that time.
The present reports are that Fernan
dez, Hf.vana agent for Japanese inter
ests, secured a 60,000-acre land conces
sion thru the activity of Ramon Valdes,
whose recent election to the presidency
of Panama may possibly be disputed by
the United States because of alleged
frauds and coercion.
Admiral Concas, of the Spanish navy,
selected by the Panama government as
umpire to settle the dispute with the
United States over the purchase price
of canal property, is alleged to have
given valuable information about the
canal itself.

and actual war between Germany
and Italy, of which there so far has
been no formaj declaration, now
seems probable.
The Macedonian campaign Itself
does not yet seem to have de
veloped any engagements of first

tivity along the 150 mile fighting
front with successos claimed by
each side at various polntB,
Paris, Aug. 21.—Italian troops

to disembark at Salonlki yesterday.
says a Havas dispatch from th&t point.
On leaving their ships the Italians
passed thru Salonlki to camp, preoeded
by military bands of the allies and
cheered by the populace.
Active preparation by Italian troopa
In the Salonlki campaign would mean
the existence of a state of war between
Germany and Italy. Germany Is dl
rectlng the campaign against the allies .d
on this front and the official state
ments show Germany has foroes there.
Some Austrian troops also probably
are employed and possibly Turks, but'
tho major portion of the army is made it
up of Bulgarians. Recent reports have
Indicated the, withdrawal of AustrUut ,.
troops from the fialkaoa. -j
Extensive Campaign Indicated.
As the enteno alllek are believed to
have a force of some 700,000 British,
French and Serbian troops on thia
front the sending of additional troops
at this time, just after tho opening of
hostilities on a big scale, would Indi
cate that the allies have embarked on
ap extensive campaign.
Italy, which has a considerable sur
plus of troops, was urged to take an
gcttve part in the Balkan campaign.
There have been several recent Indica
tions thnt a declaration of hostilities
with Germany was forthcoming. A
commercial treaty was abrogated, a
German court ruled thnt Germany is
actually tho not formally at war with
Italy, and last week was reported
that the defense of Trieste would be
taken over by Germany.
GREEK FORCES RETIRE.
Make No Resistance to Advance of Bul
garian Army.
Athens, Aug. 21.—The Bulgarian
forces moving toward Kavala have al
ready pushed their outposts to a point
seven miles from that Greek seaport.
Tho Greek government has ordered
three divisions of the Greek army still
remaining in tho vicinity of Drama and
Serres to retire bo'oro the Bulgarian
advunce, which was explained to the
Associated Press correspondent by a
military authority of the entente allies
us follows:
The Serbians had not finished tho
ohcluslon of their positions in the Fior
ina, Carniljouva and Corytsa sectors,
and therefore the Bulgarians found it
easy to enforce a certain retirement, but
It is difficult to see whore they expect to
get by an advance at this part of the
line.
Kast of the Struma the Demlr-Hissar
and Sarlchaban sectors were not held by
tho entente forces and offered no im
pediment to tho advance. Where the
enemy attacked tho regular defenses of
Salonlki, namely In Doiran-Collvi sec
tor, they accompllshd nothing. 80 far
the attack Is without strategic value
and oan bo assumed to be only for poli
tical purposes.
Bulgarian air raids on Kilkich and
Yannlnmasa killed a number of Greeks.
The Bulgarian and German ministers
have repeated previous assurances that
the integrity of Greece will be respect
ed. The French and British ministers
his morning asked Premier Zamlswhat
measures Greece proposes taking to
control the civil populace In the at
tacked districts, who are fleeing In all
directions.
Bulgars Confident.
Berlin, Aug. 21.—Bulgarians are pre
pared to repulse all attacks from what
ever quarter. Premier Radoslavoff de
clared In an address to parliament, as
quoted In a dispatch from Sofia to the
Overseas News Agency. The general,
offensive of the entente allies, he said,
had demonstrated that the forces of the
central powers could not be shaken. Be
fore adjourning congress voted a fur
ther war credit of S5.om.300 leva (about
$7,000,000).
