while she 1 ig attacks of July 1 and

Two battnlions were on the left
with more guns to help them, prob

curtain of fire on their front while
other were busy with other detain

WASHINGTON,
P. Leased Wire
August 20. I'resi-
aent Wilson's week of conferences with
ranking officials of the railroads and
leaders of their employes, threatening
a nation-wide strike, are believed by all
parties to the controversy to have
brought the situation-to a point where
telegram made puhlic at the White
1 House th president declared he held
firmly to arbitration as a principle and
' that his plan strengthened rather than
weakened it. He aiso said that some
j means must be found to prevent the
; existing situation from ever arising
i again.
I Meantime, the road , of f icials, who
I have tentatively refused to accept Mr.
j Wilson's r proposal, continued confer
ences among themselves. The labor
leaders, who already have approved the
proposal, marked time awaiting a def
inite decision from the employers.
The president s telegram defending
his plan was in reply to an appeal from
George Pope, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers urging
that the principle of arbitration be pre
served in the strike negotiations. Mr.
Pope's telegram follows:
Hartford, Conn., August 18.
"The President,
"The White House:
'On behalf of thit-y-seven hundred,
manufacturing organizations employ
ing three million persons and utterly
dependent upon uninterrupted railroad
service for thvir continued operation, i
beg to at once express our deep appre
ciation of your efforts to prevent the
threatened destructive stoppage of na-
,' tional railroad service and to resneet-
1 fullv urge that von will with all the
I sincerely believe no man in our history
has possessed such an opportunity to
j fortify this essential principle of pub-
I lie security against future attack by
j employer or employe.
j "GEORGE POPE.
I "President. National Association of
Manufacturers.' '
! The president replied:
Allow me to acknowledge the re
ceipt of your telegram of August IS
and to say In reply that I hold to the
I principle of arbitration with as clear a
j conviction and as firm a purpose as
i anyone, but unfortunately there is no
; means now in existence by which arbi
tration can be secuivd. The existing
I means have been tried and have failed.
i This situation must never be allowed
to arise again, but it ias arisen. Some
means must be found to prevent its re
currence, but no means can be found
off-hand, or in a hurry or in season to
meet the present national emergency.
"What I am proposing does hot
weaken or discredit the principle of
arbitration. It strengthens it rather.
It proposes that nothing be conceded
except the eight-hour day, to which the
whole economic movement of the time
seems to point, and the immediate cre
ation of an agency for determining all
the arbitrable elements in this case in
i the light not of predictions or fore
casts, but of established and ascer
tained facts. TJjiis Is the first stage of
the direct road to the discovery of the
best permanent basis for arbitration
when other means, than those now
available are supplied."
There were no Outward developments
today pending arrival of the additional
railroad executives to whom the presi
dent sent invitations yesterday. Louis
YV. HiJJ. president of t,he Great Nor
thern, and several other western rail
road presidents will arrive tomorrow
morning and others are expected at
night.
Representatives of both sides are
prepared to remain here until the final
word is spoken and a strike declared
or averted.
President Wilson made no engage
ments for tomorrow, in order to be
ready to continue negotiations with the
railroad presidents but it was thought
probable that there would be no fur
ther general While House conferences
until Tuesday. Although the railroad
executives continue to maintain their
position in opposition to the president's
plan and in favor of arbitration, ad
ministration officials express hope that
ultimately they wouM decide to nego-
