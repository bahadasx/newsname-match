Bulgarians Within Ten Miles
of Greek Port of Kavala
Alarms the Greeks
By Ed L. Keen.
(I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
London, Aug. 21. The Bulgarians
have opened heavy attacks on both
wings of the allied armies in Greece and
serious fighting is going on at both
eudB of the 150 mile battle front.
The German war office this afternoon
.announced that the Bulgars have cap
tured Vichill, southeast of the Greek
town of Fiorina, whose capture was of
ficially announced Friday and have tak
mi other Serbian positions. An Athens
dispatch reported another Bulgarian
iorce less than 10 mile's from the im
portant Greek port of Kavala. The in
vasion of Greece has brought a new
crisis to the Greek capital and has re
Hulted in sudden conferences between
the ministerial and the military heads.
The Bulgarian advance has aroused no
alarm in allied military circles. The
Bulgars, it was stated here this after
noon "are merely playing the game the
Germans tried unsuccessfully at Verdun.
They are hitting hard, counting ou get
ting & start before the allies begin an
offensive."
The fighting in the Balkans which
threatened at apy moment to develop
into a great battle along the- whole
Greek border, eclipsed in interest opera
tions on other 'fronts today. Aside from
unsuccessful attempts by the Germans
to recover lost ground on the Verdun
and Homme fronts, no events of im
portance occurred in any other theatre
of war. "

Petrograd, Aug. 21. By suddenly
shifting his attack to the Stochod river
front northeast of Kovel, General Bru
ailoff has ciught the Germans off their
guard and is driving westward for sub
stantial gains.
Realizing that General Bothmer's
army had been crushed, the Germans
began stripping their northern front of
every available man and sending them
southward to defend Lemberg. It was
while this troop movement was under
way that Brusiloff struck further north
'with his right wing. His flanking at
tack menaces both Kovel and the Ger
mnn army at Piusk.
The Bussian frontal attacks upon Ko
vel have practically ceased. The Ger
mnns have sunk turrets in the marshy
ground west of the city. These turrets
tire practically invisible to Russian air
scouts and must be overcome by
trntegy rather than by massed infan
try onslaughts. Consequently the line
west of Kovel has remained stationary
for some time.
During the lull on the Kovel front,
tV' Hussion armies under Generals Kal
edin, Sakharoff and Letchitsky swung
west ward like a deadly pendulum from
Kovel, as a pivot, crushing Bothmer's
army along the Stripa. Like the move
ment of a pendulum the advance was
1nipnrtinnntely faster in the extreme
south.
Kxpcrt opinion here believes that
more depends upon Brusiloff's cam-

Railroad Magnates Far From
Harmonious, , and Show
Signs of Yielding
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 21. Two score rail
road presidents, representing the great
est railroad systems in the world, were
in conference here late this afternoon
forming the final answer they will make
to the proposals advanced by President
WiUon in an effort to avert a strike
that would paralyze the nation.
The heads of the great Bystems went
into secret session after hearing an im
passioned appeal by the president of the
United States to "keep the railroads
running, not only in the interests of
this country, but in order to meet the
demands of the entire world."
"I am williug to allow the case to go
to the great American jury and let them
assess the responsibility," said the
president to the railway presidents.
"I wish you to consider the conse
quences of a failure to agree as they
may affect the people of the great cities
and the countryside. ' The country can
not live if the means of keeping olive
its vitality are interfered with.
"The rives and fortunes of . .100,000,
000 men, women and little ones some
of whom may die depend on what may
be done in this room. I leave the mat
ter to you. ' "
. "I appeal to yon as one American
citizen to another to avoid this disas
ter." The president made the railroad
presidents a .10 minute address during
the White House meeting. The heads
of the system whose properties repre
sent the arteries of the country through
which the life blood of its business
flows walked or rode through a blister
ing heat from their hotels to the White
House to hear the chief executive's
final appeal. -
Millions Would Suffer.
' The president outlined to them the
need at the present for the railroads
co-operation in the interests of prepar
edness as one point in the broader
ground be took.
It had been learned earlier in the day
that reports to the treasury and agri
cultural departments showed that a
strike would mean the loss of millions
of dollars in crops. But the president
went even beyond the domestic situa
tion when he told tne railroad heads
that not only in this country but abroad
"where the people of all the belligerent
nations are looking to the United
States," the co-operation of the big
railroad systems is absolutely essential.
The country is in the midst of a great
movement for national preparedness,
tho president told his hearers. The rail
roads form one of the fundamental
stones in his foundation. But. the presi
dent added, it is not only for national
preparedness that we must keep our
house in order but we must prepare to
meet the gigantic, business struggle into
which this country will inject itself ns
an active competitor after the European
war is over."
The president snid be was trying to

would surrer as a result of a
catastrophe a picture of mothers
the picture of little ones, dying per
haps, because they could not get food."
Ho urged the railroad chiefs "for
we are trustees in this matter, each of
us,"' to co-operate with hi min main
taining business and national order at
this time.
Loss Would be Incalcuable.
' Washington, Aug. 21. Loss of mil
lions of dollars in crops throughout the
country in event of a railroad strike
was the new possibility before the ad
ministration today.
The treasury department reported
that agents of the 'federal reserve board
jin the south, west and northv.est are be
ginning to ask for funds for the annual
!"crop moving" period. A tie-up of
the railroads of the country would mean
, that wheat and other products now
ready for the mills would be held up in
definitely nnd possibly rot on side
i ru. un ii mupjieu in irtiiiHii.
This angle of the threatened gigantic
strike was borne home to officials, not
only by reports from the treasury de
partment but by the arrival of western
railroad presidents, such as Louis V.
Hill, whose father's name was synony
mous with the empire of the northwest
and its wealth of iarmland.
More than two score railroad presi
dents and the 640 brotherhood represen
tatives held separate meetings today to
