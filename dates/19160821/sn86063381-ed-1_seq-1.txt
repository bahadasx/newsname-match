SOUTH AMERICAN PEOPLE
RESENT BRITISH BLACKLIST
(By United Press)
Buenos Aires, Argentine, Aug. 21.
South Americans resent the Brit
ish blacklist as much as the United
States does.
PROMISE TO REDUCE THE
COST OP LIVING
NOT KEPT.
Our opponents promised to
reduce the cost of living. This
they have failed to do but they
did reduce the opportunities of
making a living. Let us not for
get the conditions that existed
iu this country under the new
tariff prior to the outbreak of
the war. Production had de
creased, business was languish
ing, new enterprises were not
undertaken, instead of expan
sion there was curtailment, and
our streets were filled with the
unemployed. What ground is
there for expecting better con
ditions when the unhealthy
stimulus of the war has spent
its force and our industries and
working-men are exposed to the
competition of an energized Eu
rope?
It Is plain that we must have
protective upbuilding policies.
From Mr. Hughes' speech of
acceptance.

To Meet Tomorrow.
Washington, Aug. 21.The
railway presidents did not ac
cept President Wilson's invita
tion to meet at 2:30 this after
noon. They had other plans and
will meet with the president to
morrow.
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug. 21.Big rail
way men arriving here today answer
ing the president's summons, had but
one word and that was arbitration.
President Wilson met this with a &
claim that his plan of an eight-hour
day and a commission to investigate
the arbitration points was the surest
means of bringing about a permanent
workable arbitration for the future.
Brotherhoods Satisfied.
Apparently the brotherhoods are
satisfied that they have won Presi
dent Wilson's approval of an eight
hour day.
It is rumored here this afternoon
-the presidents of the railways are di
vided on standing pat and may nut up 4
counter proposals.
The situation today-was described
by a railroad president as "not hope
less, but graver 1&% ,jb
Two Points Found.
The railroad officials found two
points in President's Wilson's public
statement of his settlement plan that
comforted them and lead to a belief
that eventually there will be an
agreement averting a strike. The
first was a hint that if the facts war
ranted, the interstate commerce com
mission might grant an increase in
freight rates, and the second was a
suggestion that the eight-hour base
would be accepted only tentatively,
and might be terminated after in
vestigation by the commission pro
vided under the president's plan.
The companies would be under ad
ditional expense while the investiga
tion was in progress but in provision
of Mr. Wilson a report might b'e ex
pected in a few months.
Federal Ownership.
It was reported today that the at
torney general, at the president's re
quest, has drafted a* bill for the tak
ing over of the railroads if a strike
comes. It is considered justified un
der the welfare clause of the Con
stitution. It is reported that the bill,
if enforced, will draft employes as
the country drafts soldiers in time of
war.
