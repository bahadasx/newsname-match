Many Business Men and
Trade Bodies Urge
Arbitration.
Washington, Aug. 21.—
Wilson called the railroad
presidents to the White
House for a conference again
this afternoon. Upon the ar
rival of all western presi
dents, Wilson was notified
that they were prepared to
confer.
As the presidents entered
the White House, Hale Hol
den, spokesman, said:
"The executives already
here sought to maintain op
en minds on the entire ques
tion, but that after Wilson
had explaj^d his plan to the
new "arrivals, consideration
of all questions will be be
gun with the object of reach
ing a final decision."
Washington, Aug. 21.—Although
no farther general White House con
ference is to be held before tomorrow,
ilt was apparent here today that Im
portant developments in the threat
ened nation-wide railway strike are
looked for.
President Wilson made no engage
ments for today and was ready to
continue negotiations with the rall
road presidents, several of whom ar
rived from the west in response to
Wilson's summons.
It was reliably reported in railroad
circles here today that the railroad
officials who tentatively refused Wil
son's plan for an eight-hour day with
pro-rata pay for overtime and inves
tigation' by a commission of other
Issues, are considering a counter pro
posal. This counter proposal Includes
arbitration of some points, with the
granting of others.
Wilson had before him today a
number of telegrams from business
men and trade bodies, urging him to
insist on arbitration.
Railroad presidents and their com
mittee of managers worked steadily
today to devise some means of avert
ing a strike, which would in the main
accept Wilson's plan, but also pre
serve the principle of arbitration.
Leaders of the railroad executives
declared that they were united ag»i»mt
the plan as it stands and hoped to
agree on some form of counter^-pro
possl
Western railroad presidents seemed
oonfldent that a way would be found
to avert a big strike.
The president will not confer with
the western men until tomorrow.
The men held a brief meeting and
adjourned until tomorrow, awaiting
developments, and meanwhile sent
a6leg&t66 to congressmen to acquaint
them with the details of the contro-
veSSh
side* said the situation is
"serious, but not hopeless."
Mark Time.
Washington, Aug. 11.—The com
mittee of 840 railway brotherhood
representatives, who already acoepted
Wilson's proposal, continued today to
mark time pending the employers'
decision.
Expect Decisive Move.
Washington. Aug. 21.—President
Wilson after a week of conferences
wftb ranking officials of the railroads
and leaders of their employes threat
ening a nation-wide strike it 1B be
lieved by
an
parties to the controv­
ersy to have brought the situation to
a point where deoislve developments
may be expected within a few days.
While the negotiations took no ac
tual forward step yesterday, the
president replied indirectly to con
tenttona of the road officials that the
principle of arbitration would be en
dangered by his plan for putitng the
eight-hour haste day Into effect while
a commission Investigates Its prac
ticability and passes up on other
points at Issue- In a telegram made
public at Qie Whits House the presi
dent declared he hold firmly to arbi
tration as a principle and that his
plan strengthened rather than weak
ened It. He also said that some
must be found to prevent the
situation from ever arising
Continue.
Meantime the road officials who
have tentatively refused to accept Mr.
WilSon's proposal, continued confer
ences among themselves. Labor lead*
era who already have approved the
proposal, marked time awaiting a
definite decision from the employers.

Aug. 20, via London, Aug. 21-—What
two battalions did and how they did
it was the most thrilling Incident of
the last 24 hours of sensational fight
ing from the Anore to the Bomme.
The struggle went on in freakish Au
gust weather, with alternate cloud
bursts and flashes of lightning, rain
bows and sunshine.
All along the line from the soyth
of the Ancre the British left their
trenches while the French were hard
at it on their right. The time chooen
was 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon
while the big attacks of July 1 and
14 were in the early morning.
Two battalions were on the left with
more guns to help them probably
than any two battalions that ever
made a charge. One hundred oan
non were engaged in making a cur
tain of fire on their front while others
were busy with. other details of the
staff plan. Nothing in the whole of
fensive was so dramatically staged or
came off with greater success.
The Germans still held on In their
old first line trenches, where their
machine guns brought up from unde
stroyed dugouts held out the British
on July 1, while the British right
swung on this section as a pivot
through Contalmalson and Posieres to
the summit of the ridge, burrowing
forward as the guns blasted away.
Sharper and Sharper grew the angle
of the new British line to the old Ger

the Germans stuck to those elaborate
defenses of nearly two years prepara

Washington, Aug. 21.—Investiga

lantic end of the canal is being sought
by a Spaniard, named Fernandez,
presumably for Japanese interests,
was ordered today by Secretary Lans
ing. Lansing refused to discuss the re
port in detail, but considered it so
significant that the department should
begin action.
In diplomatic circles it is common
ly believed that private Japanese
shipping interests are seeking the
land, through Spanish intermediaries
to establish a base for storing coal at
lower rates than could be had from
the American government monopoly
base. This belief prevailed several
months ago, when rumors of a simi
lar nature, which have been common
since the canal was well under way,
became more persistent.

Fryatt chose the latter.
Although in several close places

elude them, and always escaped
whether through skillful dodging or
with the aid. of a friendly fog. He
escaped. On two occasions in the
mor.th of March, he escaped destruc

captured, and after a court martial
by the Germans, vtbls shot.

for several months, because he de
clined to take part In the war. This
report says Mr- Angell's plea that be

court.
This unconfirmed report from Ber

Washington, Aug. 21—Adjournment
of congress now waits only on the
passage of the emergency revenue bill,
repassage of the army appropriation
bill with amendments to meet Presi
dent Wilson's veto, completion of the
general deficiency appropriation meas
ure and final action on a .few confer
ence reports, including the govern
ment shipping bill. Senate leaders
who have grown optimistic over the
rapid progress of legislation within
the last few days say they would be
ready to adjourn next Saturday if the
house could be prevailed upon to ac
cept the amended revenue bill with
out a fight. This does not seem likely,
however, and because of some dis
cussion that may arise over general
deficiency appropriations, congress
probably, will not be ready for the
adjournment gavel before September
1 or 2.
Fears of Indefinite delay resulting
from President Wilson's veto of the
army appropriation bill because of
Its exemption from the military code
of retired officers and men have al
most entirely disappeared. On Tues
day the house will repass the bill
under Bpeclal rule with the articles
of war which contained Representa
tive Hay's objectionable amendment
eUmlpated. It will be rushed to the
senate, where the plan Is to reinsert
the articles of war minus the Hay
amendment. Unless present plans
miscarry the bill will then go to oon
ferenoe and Representative Hay, his
friends declare, will surrender. There
is a possibility, however, that the ar
ticles of war may be thrown out In
the senate on a point of ordar that
they are not germane to an appropria
tion bill. If any senator makes the
point that will end the controversy.

assured by republican leaders who
propose to make the bill the target
for vigorous political assault that they
can finish their attack in four or five
days at the most, some time, how
ever, will be taken by democratic sen
ators who oppose certain features of
the bill. Senator Underwood will op
pose the creation of a tariff commis
sion and the proposed Increased tariff

both are against democratic doctrine.
Some of the house leaders do not
like some of the senate amendments
to the bill. Representative Kitchin,
ths majority leader, is particularly
vigorous in his denunciation of the
senate changes and in conference
some of them may be sacrificed. The
recommendation for a bond issue of
$1(0,000,000 to meet expenses of the
Mexican emergency, house leaders
say, will be accepted, having' origin

Republican, and democratic, leaders
alike assert that odds and ends of
legislation still pending will be entire

adjournment and that nothing can
prevent congress getting away after
the revenue and general deficiency
bills are passed. They declare such
things as corrupt political practices

ENTENTE HAS VAST FORCES AT SALONIKI
Paris, Aug. 21.—As the entente allies are believed to have a force
of some 700,000 British, French and Serbian troops 011 the Saloniki
front, the sending of Italian reinforcements now, just after the openhiR
of hostilities on a large scale, would indicate that the allies have em
barked on a campaign of extensive proportions.
Italy, which has a considerable surplus of troops, has been urged
to take part In the Balkan operations, but is believed to hare refrain
ed partly on account of the fact that she was not at war with Ger
many. There have been several recent indications, however, that a dec
laration of hostilities was forthcoming.
llie commercial, treaty between these nations was abrogated by a
German court ruling, and Germany was actually, though not formal
ly, at war with Italy. Last week it was reported that the defense at
Trieste would be taken over by the Germans.
Italian participation In the Balkan operations hitherto was limited!
to the occupation of the Albanian port, Avlona, which was effected
before Italy declared war on Austria.
Italian Troops Disembark at Saloniki.
Paris. Aug. 21.—Italian troops began to disembark at Saloniki yester
day, a Navaa dispatch from that point says.
On leaving their ships, the dispatch says, the Italians passed through
Saloniki to the camp, preceded by military bands of the allies, and wera
cheered by the populace.
Active participation by the Italian troops in the Saloniki campaign
would mean the existence of a atatfe of war between Germany and- Italy.

Consternation in Greece.
Athens, via London, Aug. 21.—The Bulgarian occupation of Fiorina
caused consternation in the capital, and there were hasty conferences of
the king, the general staff and members of the cabinet. The advance of:
German and Bulgarian forces in the dlrction of Kavala. also is causing dis
quiet, although the impression la general that this movement is a mere pov
litlcal maneuver, calculated to influence Rumania and affect the Greek
elections.
The Royalist party in Greece is talcing extraordinary precautions pre
paratory to the coming election. King Constantine is constantly guarded,
and vieits the capital .only on rare occasions.
On these jourineys, a cordon of soldiers constituting a brigade, guards
every approach to the road between the kings villa at Tatoi and Athens.
