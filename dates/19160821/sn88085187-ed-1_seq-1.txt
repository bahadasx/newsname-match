COPPER, KING OF
SHELTER. M BE
RULER 0' THE MR
Romance of Monster
Tacoma Plant Told
by Woman Reporter
BY MABEL ABBOTT
In August, 1914, the European war broke out.
It took me two hours and a half of steady
walking Friday, to see, even superficially, the
enlarged plant of the Tacoma smelter.
There is a real connection between these
statements.
Within a short time after the war began, the
London Times estimated that the Allies were
hurling copper at the Germans at the rate of
over 100,000 metric tons per annum; an estimate
made in Berlin at about the same time placed
the consumption of copper on the German firing
line at the same figure; and it has increased In
calculably since then.
"Copper," said the Literary l>igcst in the
spring of 1915, "is the decisive factor in the
war."
By that time, the Germans were confiscating
old kettles, stable fittings, kitchen utensils,
doorknobs—everything that had any copper in
it —and searching the battlefields for empty
cartridge cases and copper remnants.
Japan was buying from the unsuspecting
Chinese cargoes of "li" coins, smelting them and
exporting the resulting copper at tremendous
profits. The University of Washington ripped a
wornout copper roof from one of its buildings
and sold it for enough to buy a fine new roof of
another material and have a handsome surplus
left.
And the Tacoma Smelling & Refining Co. was
undertaking enlargements that would practical
ly double its capacity, in the effort to keep up
with the stream of copper ore that eager pro
ducers were rushing out of the mines in order to
get the benefit of the fabulous war prices.
Mountains of Ore
Those enlargements are now practically all
completed and in use. Some of the buildings
which are still outwardly unfinished, have been
occupied for months. The fervent energy of the
huge new reverbatory furnace has already
burned out part of its brick lining.
The plant is working to the full of its new
capacity, and shipping 200 tons of finished
copper every day; and still ship after ship
wallows heavily to the wharf to be relieved
of its burden, and the ore is piled in jade
green and smoke-gray mountains in the
yard.
The copper comes from South America and
Alaska, from Montana and Korea, and from
many places in between.
It goes mostly to Detroit, and other places in
Michigan, where big munitions factones are.
And thence it goes —well, the French are
using rifle bullets that are mostly copper; cart
ridge cases, both small and large, are made of
brass, which contains much copper; shrapnel
shells have brass firing-heads and copper girdles;
and all the ai-mies use much copper for telephone
wire, machinery part, etc.
Roscoe Teats, assistant superintendent, was
my chaperone through the plant.
It's Safety First
As nearly as my untechnical mind could grasp
his explanations, the process that converts the
ore in the movable bunkers on the wharf into
iridescent ingots was about like this:
First, it is crushed — the concentrates, of
course, do not have to be crushed—then it is
measured in proportions dictated by the assay

TAX GAINS

WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 11.
—Detailed Income tax figures
just made public by the treasury
department, shows that the great
est increase in personal tax col
lections were exactly as I predict
ed, among the Ml'l.Tl-.MII.I.ION
AIHKS, with incomes of more
than $..00,000 a year.

Kroup Increased 041 per cent,
while the collections from
those \>itli incomes under
950.0410 Increased less than
•%4I |ier cent.
When I started investigation of
the income tax for the newspapers
served by the Newspaper Enter
prise Association last October, I
was told by officials of the treas
ury department that the people
who were evading the tax were
those with small incomes who re
fused to make returns.
1 was soon convinced, as a re
sult of my investigations, that the
big evasions were among the
nnilti- millionaire class, who were
reporting only a small part cf
their incomes.
I told the treasury officials
that, in ray opinion, a vigorous
enforcement of the law, even
without publicity of returns,
would easily double the revenue
from this class of taxpayers.
Ihiring the past year tlie
efficiency and \ijjor of (lie
