[SHORTAGE IN A WEEK
The railway presidents augmented
by the new arrivals arranged for a
conference with President TV 11 son at
2:30 this afternoon. It Is understood
the president, earlier in the day, had
•uggested such a meeting in response
to intimations that the railway heads
desired further development of some
of the ideas expressed in his public
statement Saturday. They want to
know what may be expected in the
way of co-operation from the inter
state commerce commission In case of
necessary rate adjustments and also
what the president may have in mind
regarding future prevention of crises
Hke the present.
The conference of railway presi
dents this morning was unique. Men
representing millions of dollars of
railway wealth moved about the tenth
floor of the new Willard "getting
down to brass tacks" on the situation
confronting them. It was all informal,
the executives talking first In one
group then in another, "seeking Ideas

WASHINGTON, Aug. 21—LQSS of
millions of dollars in crops through
I out the country In the event of a rail
I road strike was the new possibility
I before the administration today.
The treasury department reported
I that agents of the federal reserve
board in the south, west and northwest
are beginning to ask for funds for the
annual "crop qvoving" period. A tie
up of the railways of the country
would mean that wheat and other
pioduucts now.ready tor the mills
would be held up Indefinitely and
possibly rot on side tracks if stopped
tat transit.
Thte angle of the threatened gigan
tic strike was borne home to officials
not only by reports from the treasury
department, but by the arrival of
western railway presidents such as
Louis W. Hill, whose father's name
was synonymous with the "empire of
the northwest" and its wealth of farh
lands. More than two score railway
presidents and the 640 brotherhood
representatives held separate meet
ings today to continue discussion of
President Wilson's proposals looking
toward peace.

PARIS, Aug. 21.—The Germans
made a second desperate attempt to
re-capture the village of Fleury, three
and one-half miles northeast of Verdun
last night, attacking in force, after
spraying the French positions with
liquid Are. The war office announced
today that French barrage Infantry
fire stopped the attack short, Inflict
ing serious losses on the enemy.
In yesterday's fighting north of
the Soinme, in which the French cap
tured a strongly fortified wood be
tween Guillemont and Maurepas, six
German cannon were captured. Last
night an active artillery duel con
tinued on the Somme front, but there
were no Infantry engagements of
importance.
Practically the whole village of
Maurepas is now in French hands as
the result of Thursday's fighting and
local actions since that time. The
French first captured a number of
strong positions at the outskirts of
the town and then drove the Ger
mans from the remainder of the vil
lage with their artillery., The Ger
JWrn artillery" made It -Inadvisable for
the French to occupy the remainder
of Maurepas, until th& French lines
were advanced further north of the
village.

The Bulgars emerged fiem the vil

vance southward. At th"? same time
other strong Bulgarian detachments
attempted an offensive along the

LONDON, Aug. 21.—The Bulgarians
have opened heavy attacks on tooth
wings of the allied armies in G-reece
and serious fighting is going ion at
both ends of the 150 mile battle
front.
The German war office this after
noon announced that the Bulgars
have captured Vichill, southeast of
the Greek town of Fiorina, whose
capture was officially announced Fri
day and have taken other Serbian
positions. An Athens dispatch re
ported another Bulgarian force less
than ten miles from the important
Greek port of Kavala. The invasion
of Greece has -brought a new crisis
to the Greek capital and has resulted
in sudden conferences between minis
terial and military heads. The Bul
garian advance has aroused no alarm
in allied military circles.
The Bulgars, it was stated here
this afternoon, are merely playing
the game the Germane tried unsuc
cessfully at Verdun. They ore hit

LONDON, Aug. 21.—The sinking of

in the North sea, the first naval fight
since Jutland, is distinctly unfortun
ate, the naval expert of the Daily
News asserted today, but it is the
penalty that must be paid by a

"In the Dodder Bank fight last year

The Battle on Land.
LONDON, Aug. 21.—British cover

enemy forces northeast of FouVaux

Germans were unable to follow up the
advantage because of British artillery
fire, General Haig reported this after
noon. The Germans three times at
tacked British positions at Foreaux
wood after heavy bombardment, but
were each time repulsed.
The Germans bombarded British
positions near Pozieres and north
east of the Contalmaison with gas
shells last night.
in the northern fighting zone, the
Germans attempted a raid on British
trenches northeast of iHulluch and
east of Leplentin.
They were driven back, entering
the British position at only one point,
from which they were immediately
ejected.

[By (Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.—Big rail
road men of the west hurrying into
Washington today with the single
demand of "arbitration" on their Hps
found President Wilson's answer
waiting them. It is that acceptance
of the eiglht hour day now and ap
pointment lof a commission to in
vestigate all the arbitration points
involved in the threatened railway
strike,
ie
tihe surest means towards
(bringing about a permanent workable
arbitration for the future.
Arrival of the western rsdlroad
presidents and receipts of hundreds
of telegrams from commercial and
Industrial concerns all over the coun
try were the features of tihe first
day rof the second week of the (presi
dent's intervention ibetrween the war
ring railways and railroad brother
hoods. The presidents came at Pres
ident Wilson's Invitation- and the
telegrams in part at least at the in
vitation of the railroad®.
^Railrojtd executives here made no
secret of the fact that they were
lining up ail -possible business support
for their arbitration contention. The
president made hds answer known in
reply to one of these telegrams that
from George Pope, •president of tihe
National Association of tMonufao
^urcrs
Pope declared 3,700 (manufacturing
concerns employing 3,000,000 persons,
are utterly dependent xn uninter
rupted railway service. He urged
the president to prevent the threat
ened stoppage of railroad service and
at the same time to maintain tho
principle of arbitration. Existing,
means have failed, he replied, ana
declared he was moving to strength
en the principle of arbitration so such
a situation cannot arise again. Re
garding the eight hour day he said in
his telegram to Pope: "The whole
economic movement all the time
seems to point to it. The opinion in
Washington today is that demand*
on the •president by the railway
heads for arbitration of the elgui
hour day therefore will not move
him."
The conflict would seem irrecon
cdlible, -but the feeling in Washington
seeims that in some manner a strike
will be avoided. Representatives of
'brotherhoods now consider them
selves more or less on the side lines.
It has become a struggle between
President Wilson and the railroads
for the time being, they say, and
they are waiting to see how it comes
out before they again take a hand.
Louis W. Hill, head of the Great
Northern, arrived at 9:20 a. m. He
was given a hearty greeting by other
presidents and railway men in tho
lobby of the Willard hotel. H6 de

he had had time to go over the situ

PETROGRAD. Aug. 21,—By sud
denly shifting his attack to the,-'
Stochod river front northeast
Kovel, General Brusiloff has caught
the Germans off their guard, and is, 1.
driving westward for bubstantlal
gains.
Realizing that General Bothmar's
army had been crashed, tbc Germans
began stripping their northern fr,at
of every available man and send'ns
them southward to defend Lemberg.
It was while this troops movement
was under way that BursUoft struck
further ^jorth'with his rig.it wing, his
flanking attack menacing both Kovel
and the German army at Plnsk. The
Russian frontal attacks upon Kovel
have practically ceased.
The Germans have sunk turrets in
the marshy ground west of the city.
These turrets are practically Invisible
to Russian air scouts and must be
overcome by strategy rather than by
massed Infantry onslaughts. Conse
quently the line west of Kovel has
remained stationary for kome time.
During the lull on the Kovel front,
the Russian armies und^r Generals
Kaledin, Sakharolf and Letchltsky
swung westward like a deadly pendu
lum from Kovel. as a pivot, crushing
Bothmer*s army along the Stripa.
Like the movement of a pendulum the
advance was proportionately faster in
the extreme south.
Expert opinion here believes that
more depends upon Bruslloffs cam
paign than the mere stand or fall of
