REPLIES TO MANUFACTURERS
Wilson Says He Is Paying Way
for Arbitration.
Capital Still Predicts Rail Srike
Will Be Averted.
Washington, Aug. 21. Big railroad
men of the west hurrying into Wash
ington today with the single .ieme.nd
of "arbitration" on their lips found
President Wilson's answer waiting
Them. It Is that acceptance of fie
eight hour day now and appointment
of a commission to investigate all the
arbitration points Involved in the
threatened railway strike, is the surest
means toward bringing about a per
manent, workable arbitration for the
future.
Arrival of the western railroad pres
idents and receipt of hundreds of tel
egrams from commercial and indus
trial concerns all over the country
were the features of the first day of
the second week of the president's
Intervention between the warring rail
roads and railroad brotherhoods. Thj
presidents came at President Wilson's
invitation and the telegrams in part
.it least. Executives here made no se
cret of the fact that they were lining
up all possible business support for
their arbitration contention.
30.IMI0 Manufacturers Appeal.
The president made his answer
known in reply to one of these tele
grams, that from George Pope, presi
dent of the National Association of
Manufacturers. Pope declared oO.OOO
manufacturing organizations employ
ing hundreds of thousands of persons
are utterly dependent on uninterrupt
ed railroad service. He urged the
president to prevent the threatened
stoppage of railroad service and at
the same time to maintain the prin
ciple nf arbitration.
Kxisting means have fniled, the
president replied, and declared he is
moving to strengthen the principle of
arbitration so that such a situation can
not rise again. Regarding the eight
hour rinv he said in his telegram to
Pope! "The whole economic move
ment of the time" seems to point
to it.
Can't Move Wilson
The opinion in Washington today is
that demands on the president by the
railroad heads for arbitration of the
eight-hour dnv, therefore, will not
move him. The conflict would seem
to be irreconcilable, but the feeling in
Washington is unmistakable that in
B"me manner the strike will be avoid
ed. Representatives of the brother
hoods now consider themselves more
or less on the side lines. It has be
come a struggle between President
Wilson and the railroad for the time
being, they say. and they are waiting
to see how it comes out. before they
again take a hand.
President TOley Arrives.
Louis W. Hill, head of the Great
Northern, arrived at 9:20 a. m. Ht
was given a hearty greeting by other
presidents and railway men in the
lobby of the Willard hotel. He de
clined to talk about the strike until
he had had time to go over the situa
tion with other executives. The latter
had arranged a meeting for 4 o'clock,
at which time the managers also were
To have a meeting. Other presidents
arriving during the morning were E.

son, former secretary of war. now re
ceiver for the Rock Island; Ralph Pe
terson. Long Island; C. R. Grey. West
ern Maryland, and L. E. Johnson,
Norfolk & Western.
The men apparently are satisfied
to have won the president's support of
the ei.tht-hour day. On other points
they may be expected to yield should
a deadlock be reached on the present

Chicago, Aug. 21. While the po
lice of western states were searching
for Max Silver, accused of looting the
two Chicago private banks of Adolph
Silver & Company, his brother
Adolph, founder of the institutions, is
hurrying back today from California
to face the depositors.
From a tetter written by Max Sil
ver to his father, the polii e are con
vinced that the fugitive banker is flee
ing westward. All day crowds of
angrv depositors besieged the bank
doors and police guard the former
home of Silver.
Most of the bank's patrons are Rus
sians and know little of American
laws.
Since February 12. 1912. nineteen
private banks have failed in Chicago.
Resorts to Tears of Grief.
San Francisco, Aug. 21. In tears
because the business he entrused to
his brother last May has been ruined
and his hope of a chance to recover
his health as a result of overwork in
building up the institutions blasted,
Adolph Silver, 28, Chicago financier,
left today for Chicago, where the two
private banks he founded have failed
and his brother. Max Silver, is sought
on a criminal charge.
"1 trusted my brother and he has
killed me," Silver repeatedly ex
claimed. He says after he had es
tablished the banks, his health failed
and he returned the institutions over
to his brother, taking his note for
$25,000 as a guarantee that he would
receive $400 a month during his life
time.
HORL LIQUID FIRE
Germans Make Desperate Ef

French Gain New Victory pn
Somme Front.
Paris. Aug. 21. The Germans made
a second desperate attempt to recap
ture the village of Fleury, three and
one-half miles northeast of Verdun,
last night, attacking in force after
spraying the French positions with li
quid fire. The war office announced
today that French barrage Infantry
fire stopped the attack short, inflict
ing serious losses on the enemy.
In yesterday's fighting north of the
Somme in which the French captured
a strongly fortified wood between
Guillemont and Maurepas, six German
cannon were captured. Last night an
active artillery duel continued on the
Somme front but there was no infan
try engagements of importance.
Practically the whole of the village
of Maurepas is now in French hands
as the result of Thursday's fighting
and local actions since that time. The
French first captured a number of
strong positions at the outskirts of the
town and then drove the Germans
from the remainder of the village with
their artillery. German artillery made
it Inadvisable for the French to occupy
the remainder of Maurepas until the
French lines were advanced further
north of the village.

this afternoon will file quo warranto
proceedings in the circuit court, cit
ing Dr. U. G. Crandell and Joseph I.
McDonald, the two members of the
board removed by Painter to show
cause why they should continue to

J. L. Davison, W. F. Davis and James
E. Cox, members of the new board.
It was stated that the proceedings
would be filed "at the relation of At

politan police forces as a result of
Lieut. Gov. W. R. Painter's removal
of Dr. V. G. Crandell and Joseph I.
McDonald, the two members of the
board of police commissioners and the
appointment of a new one.
The new board this afternoon plans
to appoint a new chief of police, who
will build up the nucleus of a new de

Berlin, Aug. 21. Bugarlan troops
have captured the village of Vichill,
southeast of Fiorina, it was officially
announced this afternoon. Another
Serbian position was stormed and cap
tured at Malkaniszplania.
Athens, Aug. 21. Bulgarian troops
are reported within ten miles of the
Greek port of Kavala, in their advance
to attack the allies' right wing. The
Greek cabinet has been called into spe
cial session because of the Bulgarian
advance into Greek territory. Generals

attending the conference.
Kavala a port of about 5,000 popu
lation with considerable trade, was
taken from Turkey by Greece in the
Balkan wars. It lies eighteen miles
west of the Bulgarian border and has
long been coveted by the Bulgars.
What Shall Greeks Do?
The government is watching the
Bulgarian invasion of Greek territory
with the greatest interest. The news
paper Patriss says the cabinet thus far
has not reached a decision and will
await further developments. From
the military standpoint the Bulgarian
advance is considered unimportant, so
far as the allies are concerned, but the
Bulgars are apparently trying to seizze
strategic positions on the allied flanks,
from which to deliver attacks when
the expected allied offensive begins.
The British and French ministers con
ferred with Premier Zamasis, who im
mediately afteward summoned the
chief of staff of the Greek army. The
discussion turned on the question of
withdrawing portions of the Greek
army and civilians from the territory
accupied by the Bulgars.
.. .Serbs Repulse Bulgars.
Saloniki. Aug. 21. Bulgarian forces
are engaged in sharp fighting with the
Serbs on a fifteen mile front seventy
miles northwest of Saloniki. The
Bulgars emerged from the village of
Fiorina and attempted an advance
southward. At the same time other
strong Bulgarian detachments at
tempted an offensive along the Mon-astir-Saloniki
railway. The Serbs
drove in the right flank of the Bul
gars force from Fiorina, forcing the
enemy back upon the town and at the
same time made a vigorous attack
eastward as far as Lake Ostrovo.
Fighting is still going on.
Incessant skirmishes between pa
trols and frequent infantry engage
ments in which whole regiments have
taken part are reported on the British
and French fronts along the whole
Greek border east of Lake Doiran. In
the Doiran district particularly hot
artillery struggles have occurred.
Airmen on both sides are very act
ive. Hostile aeroplanes attempted a
raid on allied camps south' of Doiran
but were driven back by allied avia
tors. Bulgarians Repnlse French.
Berlin, Aug. 21. The Bulgarian
headquarters statement of August 17
covering events preceding the occupa
tion of Fiorina and reporting renewal
of the fighting in the Doiran lake re
gion says:
The entire seventeenth French
cavalry division participated In the
previously reported battle of Aug
ust 15.
"The enemy s artillery continued its
fire against our positions south and
west of Lake Doiran. His infantry at
tacked at two points but met with
heavy losses when coming within
rt.nge of our fire and was forced to
retreat."

London, Aug. 21. Two British light
cruisers and a submarine were sunk
and another U-boat rammed when
the German and British high seas

"It seems impossible to produce a

to repeal the censorship law at the

hot shot statements made by the Rev.
Festus Foster In his "Aim of the Cen
sorship Bureau" talk made Sunday
morning at the Second United Presby
terian church.
Invited by the pastor and congrega
tion to speak on 'Censorship," the
speaker gave a complete airing to the
woes and tribulations of the "bored
censors" and himself. He said in
part:
"Ten times as many Topekans at
tend the movies during the week as
attend church. The movies are the
greatest problem of the age.
"The only consideration of the pro
ducers is to make money. And you
and 1 know that the more shocking
the scene naturally the more people
will want to see it.
"The producers claim that censor
ship is a. violation of personal liberty,
in the same class as violations of the
right of free speech. The fallacy of
this claim Is patent. The movies are
nothing but entertainment, and the
state has always bad the right to regu
late entertainments.

German Bulgars Make Counter

Paris, Aug. 21. Italian troops began
to disembark at Saloniki yesterday,

point.
On leaving their ships, the dispatch
says, the Italians passed through Sa
loniki to camp, preceded by military
bands of the allies and cheered by the
populace.
Active participation by Italian
troops in the Saloniki campaign would
mean the existence of a state if war be

is directing the operations against the
allies on the front and the official
German reports show she has forces
there. Some Austrian . troops also
probably are employed . and powlbly

army is made up of Bulgarians.
