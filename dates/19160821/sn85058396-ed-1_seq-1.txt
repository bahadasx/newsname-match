FLANKING MOVE
HAS 1 EFFECT
Allied Campaign in Macedonia
Will Continue With Every
Hope of Success.
Paris, Aug. 21, 5:15 a. m. The at
tempted counter offensive by the Ger
man and Bulgarian forces on both
flanks of the entente allies' front in
Macedonia with tho apparent lnteu
tion of hindering tho plans of General
Snrrnil, the entente commander, will
'have no effect on the execution of his
campaign, It is said here.
The fourth Greek army corps which
had divisions at Seres, at Lavala, and
also at Drama, fell back back before
the Bulgarians who are advancing in
eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians
have occupied Hermanli and have
crossed the Nestos (Mesta?) river and
advanced to Kavala,
These developments are considered
of secondary importance and the allies
take a hopeful view of the success of
their plans.
In the fighting at Moglen the Bul
garians, according to a despatch re
ceived here, had 400 killed, 600 wound
ed and 43 were taken prisoners.

BULGARS HOVE
TOWARDKAVALA
Outposts Already Pushed to
Point Within Seven Miles
of Greek Seaport.
i
Athens, Greece, Sunday, Aug. 20.
Via London, Aug. 21, 3:15 p. m The
Bulgarian forces moving towards Ka
vala have already pushed their out
posts to a point seven miles from that
Greek seaport.
The Greek government has ordered
three divisions of the Greek army still
remaining in the vicinity of Drama
and Serres to retire before the Bul
garian advance, which was explained
to The Associated Press' correspon
dent by a military authority of the
entente allies as follows:
Bulgarians Are Unopposed.
"The Serbians had not finished the
, -consolidation of their positions In
the Fiorina, Caradjova and Corytsa
I sectors and, therefore, the Bulgarians
found it easy enough to force a cer
tain retirement, but it is difficult to
see where they expect to get by an
advance at this part of tho line. East
of the Struma the Demlr-Hlssar and
Sarichaban sectors were not held by
the entente forces and offered no im
pediment to the advance. Where the
enemy was attacking tho defenses of
Saloniki, namely in the Doiran-Glev-gell
sector; they 'accomplished noth
ing. As the attack has so far de
veloped it is without strategic value
and can only be assumed to be for
political purposes."
Bulgarian air raids on Kilklch and
Yannlmsa killed a number of Greeks.
The Bulgarian and German min
isters here repeated previous assur
ances that the integrity of ,Greece
will be respected. The French and
British ministers this morning asked
Premier Zaimls what measures
Greece intends taking to control the
civil populace in the attacked dis
tricts who are fleeing in all directions.
ITALIANS LAI
AT SALONIKI
Troops Pass Through City
Preceded by Banks and
Cheered by Populace.
Paris, Aug. 21, 1:10 p. m. Italian
troops began to disembark at Sa
loniki, says a Havas dispatch from
that point.
On leaving their ships, the dis
patch says, the Italians passed through
Saloniki to camp, preceded by mili
tary bands of the allies and cheered
by the populace.
Active participation by Italian
troops In the Saloniki campaign
would mean tho existence of a state
of war between Germany and Italy.
Germany is directing the operations
against the allies on this front and
as the official German reports show
has forces there. Some Austrian
troops probably are employed and
possibly Turks, but tho major portion
of the army is made up' of Bulgari
ans. Recent reports have indicated
the withdrawal of Austrian troops
from the Balkans for use on the Rus
sian and Italian fronts.
Extensive Campaign (Forecast.
As the entente allies are believed
to have a force of some 700,000 Brit
ish, French and Serbian troops on
the Saloniki front, the sending of re
inforcements at this time, just after
tho opening of hostilities on a large
scale, would indicate that the allies
have embarked on a campaign of ex
tensivo proportions.
Italy, which has a considerable sur
plus of troops, has been urged to take
a more active part In the Balkan
operations, but was believed to have
refrained partly on account of the
fact that she was not at war with
Germany. There have been several
recent indications that a declaration
of hostilities was forthcoming. A
commercial trenty between these na
tions was abrogated, a German court
ruled that Germany Is actually though
not formally at war with Italy and
last week It was roported that the
defense of Triest would be taken over
y 9er,?laus- Italian participation in
the Balkans hitherto has been limited
to occupation of the Albanian port of
Av ona, which was effected beforo
Italy declared war on Austria.

Germans Have to Yield After'
Weeks of Vicious Counter
Attacks.
With the British Armies in France.
Aug. 21, via London, 1:30 p. m. Not
only have the British held all the
gains made in the Saturday attack
through the critical second day and
night following it, but they have
made another important gain. This
morning they arc within 500 yards
of Martinpuich as the result of tho
taking of a trench which had held
them up between Pozieres and High
wood. (This is the advance north of
Bazentin-le-Petlt referred'' to in last
night's official British communica
tion). In this position while the British
had been creeping up on both flanks,
vic'.ous counter attacks raged for
weeks. German resistance, strength
ened after the loss of Pozieres, had
to yield at last to the incessant hammering.

Washington, Aug. 21. President
Wilson reiterated today to the rail
road executives, including the new ar
rivals from the' west, his demand that
they accept his plan for the settle
ment of the threatened railroad
strike. The executives then began the
first of a series of meetings in which
they will frame their reply.
The president reinforced his previ
ous argument by pointing out that, as
the railroads play' an important part
in tho military preparedness of the
country and that as they are a vital
part of the industrial framework of
the nation, it was absolutely neces
sary to keep them running at the
present time.
Mr. Wilson told the railroad ex
ecutives he did not blame them for
fighting for the principle of arbitra
tion, but that he believed under pres
ent circumstances they should accept
the eight-hour day and leavo the
working out of the principle of arbi
tration until later.
The railroad executives did not
enter into an argument with tho pres
ident but afterward said they were
deeply impressed and would give full
weight to his argument at their con
ferences. Tho president declared he agreed
with them in believing arbitration of
Industrial disputes, but that, in view

to discuss the issue at present. He
urged the railroad executives and
their managers in their meetings to '
consider the disaster' whichwould fol-
low a strike.
With all the world depending in a , jH
measure upon the products of the (
United States, he said It would be a
catastrophe for the railway system H

said that In working for preparedness
in the United States, the work of the
railroads had played an important jH
