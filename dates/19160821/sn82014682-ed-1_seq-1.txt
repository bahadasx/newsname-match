WASHINGTON. D. C. Aue. . 10
The final passing of Thomas B. Stuart
as a circuit judge did not lose any
picturesque and mystifying features.
These continued until the last
A week after scheduled time the
resignation .of Judge ' Stuart was
placed in the hands of President Wil
son. It was taken to the White House
by Senator Shafroth and delivered in
person. . More than 24 hours later it
leached the department of justice.
Immediate acceDtance followed, with
the casual stipulation that it should
be effective upon the qualification of
his successor. This Is always Inserted
to prevent depletion of the. bench by
wholesale reslgrions. The letter of
Judge Stuart requested relief "as
soon as possible."
It was found that the letter of resig
nation was dated Honolulu, April 18.
It was but 10 days less than four
months in A reaching .the president
This doubtless was due to the fre
quent exchanges between the Judge
and Senator Shafroth. The date oc
casioned, much comment among offi
cials. . -v. ' J
Almost cbicidetiVkV the resigna
tion came ' the ft. t rHcity given
Judge Stuart's all.-aatlons against the
president. Secretary Lane, Attorney
General Gregory, Governor Pinkham
and others. The frantic efforts of the
Judge's press bureau to secure tho
general publication of his letter to
the president, utterly failed. Not a
word was used, "ut, when the Star
Bulletin of July 18,, containing the
complete letter of Judge Stuart,
reached New York it was boiled down
and published. This was copied and
spread around to a considerable ex
tnet Close on the heels of this came
the real resignation.
In the meantime. President Wllsoa
made It impossible for any of the offi
cials, mentioned in the letter of Judge
Stuart to peruse it at length. Attor
ney General Gregory was the first to
request a copy of it The president
then took a pair of sears and whacked
the latter up into "takes." All those
referring directly to himself went dh
rectly into the waste basket Those
mentioning other were sent to the in
terested parties. The attorney gen
eral received the section belonging to
him. It is surmised that the take re
lating to Governor Pinkham was sent
along to HawalL In ho case was there
an explanation desired. The excerpts
were merely for information and be
cause of requests.
Department of justice officials be
gan looking for a successor to Judge
Stuart a week before his resignation
came to the Wrhite House. As no new
names of ellglbles had been suggested
consideration was confined to the sur
plus recommended for appointment
when several vacancies existed in the
courts of Hawaii. In this way the
mulling process was in full swing
when the belated resignation finally
landed in the department of justice.-
It is estimated by the census and
statistics office of Canada that the
area devoted to oats for 1916 is 10,
499,500 acres, as compared with 11.
SC3.000 acres In 1915 and 10,061,000

JUDGE STUARrS
HONOLULU SUGGESTED FOR
WORLD-PEACE CONFERENCE
New York Financial Organ Urges Unique Advantage of Cross
Roads of Pacific for Important Tribunal
Daily Financial America, under date of August 7, 1916, suggests to the
Chamber of Commerce of Honolulu that Honolulu, capital of the Territory
of Hawaii, midway between possessions held, by the more powerful nations
of the world, is a logical situation for an International tribunal, and this
opinion is voiced by pacifists who have already visited the city to better de
termine its advantages. -
It is argued that Honolulu, through its splendid ocean transportation
facilities, its proximity to several important capitals of the world. Is admir
ably adapted as a meeting place for those designated in later years to parti
cipate in a series of conferences leading to a lasting world peace. Honolulu
Is within easy steaming distance of the American mainland, as. well as the
coasts of Siberia, Japan. China, the Dutch Netherlands, the Indian Penin
sula and Australasia. It has regular steamship communication with the
more important points on. the west coast and is on the direct Panama canal
route of Central and South .America. j
A revival of a discussion of plans for a big peace conference to be
held at a central and a neutral point followed the visit of several diplo
mats representing the Allied and Central Powers to Honolulu, who are said
to have been favorably impressed with the possibilities offered by the city
as a second "Hague Tribunal." ;
Secretary Brown of the chamber of commerce said today that the sug
gestion Is of immediate Interest and will be given appreciative considera
tion.. .' -;.-;:v- ":". v:.!vv.:.w---.

plana for developing aviation here and
has, asked tne vwar aeparxmeni ior
biplanes and two civilian instructors.
Th field chosen Is at Fort Kame

Is easy of access from Honolulu ana
has facilities for both land and water
fivinr it fa oti'thedeft of the road
approaching the Fort Kamehameha
buildings. There are approximately
200 acres in the field, and the water

sen by Lieut Harold Geier, tne
aviator: who some time ago made
experiments here with the idea of de
veloping service flying in Hawaii
It will be recommended to the war
department that this field be used.
Interest In aviation , since Gen.
Evans announced plans has grown
steadily and rapidly. Applications by
would-be aviators are coming in at an
unexpected rate, both from civilians
and army men. Already about a doz
en Schofield -officers have applied.
The National Guard headquarters

"The annual summer troubles of

ed Henry W. Kinney, superintendent
of public instruction today, as he fin-
gured a pile of letters and wireless .
messages. A
SuDerlnlendent Kinney explains
that with all the appointments of
teachers for the coming year com
pleted, belated resignations have be
gun to come in and, as a result the
department already has four vacan
cies to fill b afore school opens next
month.
Those teacLers whose resignations
have been received are Miss Mollie
Campbell . of Kaiulani. Miss Cecelia
Black of Kaiulani Miss Constance
Seymour, cf Central Grammar and
Mrs. Emma Hottell of Central Gram
mar.
'And I am very sorry to have to
lose the last named teacher," com
mented Kinney as he finished giving
out the names.
As a consequence, teachers who
have qualified for appointment in Ho
nolulu by giving a year of satisfac
tory service in the outside schools,
will have a chance of being appointed
here. Personal illness, or the illness
of relatives, was the reason given
by the resigning teachers for their
action.
Superintendent Kinney hopes to
fill the vacancies during, the coming
week, following a conference, whether
in person or by correspondence . with
the members of the school commis
sion. - - , - -

other actively, in the war of the nations has come in the sudden dash
cf IJulgar fort-es into Greek territory south of Monastir.
The Unitarians occupation of the i-onsiderable towa of Fiorina
has caused jrreat consternation at the-' capital. Hasty conferences
are in progress between King Constantine. the general staff of the
army and the cabinet; all of whom api)ear much concerned at "Ctar''
Ferdinand's move.
It is believed lhat the occupation of this part of Greece is a
political move to influence the coming Greek elections. The royalists,
who are strongly supporting Constantine, are taking extraordinary
precautions preparatory to the election. A brigade of soldiers is
guarding the king. The libera lists headed by Ex-Premier Venirelos
are making political capital out of the Hulgar move. They favor
siding with the Allies.
PARIS, France, Aug. '21. The Bulgarian offensive undertaken
at Doiran and the move into Fiorina are considered by military ex

mainly to impress Greece and Rumania. v '
