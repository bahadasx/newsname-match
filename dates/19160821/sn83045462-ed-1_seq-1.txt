PARIS, August 21, noon.?The
Germans delivered a violent attack
on Fleury, near Verdun, last
night, using flaming liquid, hut
without result, says the war office
statement today.
That severe fighting had been
resumed at Verdun was indicated
yesterday, when the war office announced
that the Germans had
made a determined effort to recapture
the village of Fleurv from
the French. The Germans were
repulsed with severe losses, the
official statement said:
French Gain on Somme.
It was announced also that the French
had carried a strongly organized wood
between Guillemoat and Maurepas, taking
a large quantity of war material.
Today's war office communication is
as follows:
"North of the Somme in addition to
the Important captures of material
mentioned yesterday, we took six field
guns in the wood which our troops
carried yesterday between Maurepas
and Guillemont.
"During the night there were violent
artillery actions on the Somme front.
"On the right bank of the Meuse (Verdun
front) the Germans yesterday, toward
the close of the day. delivered a
powerful attack, accompanied by the
use of flaming liquids, against Fleury.
Our curtain of fire and infantry fire
obliged the enemy to stop short, and
inflicted serious losses on him."

Reports Indicate That Engagement

PARIS, August 2i, t :io p.m.?
Italian troops began to disembark
at Saloniki yesterday, says
1 a Havas dispatch from that point.
On leaving their ships, the dispatch
says, the Italians passed
through Saloniki to camp, preceded
by military bands of the
allies and cheered bv the populace.
Bulgars Advance on Kavala.
Bulgarian troops are advancing
toward the Greek seaport of Kavala,
it was announced yesterday. They
; have seized two Greek forts. At several
points along the front new engagements
have been fought.
An Athens dispatch says the Bulgarian
forces have already pushed their
1 outposts to a point seven miles from
Kavala. The Greek government has
ordered three divisions of the Greek
army still remaining in the vicinity
of Drama and Serres to retire before
the Bulgarian advance.
The Greek port of Kavala is on the
I Aegean seaT eighty miles northeast of
Saloniki and twenty miles west of the
Bulgarian border. It is some distance
to the northeast of the eastern extremity
of the fighting front, which extends
from the Gulf of Orfani to the
vicinity of Monastir.
General Engagement Continues.
Reports from Saloniki show that the
general engagement which began Friday
is continuing with intensity over
j an extended front from Fiorina, near
Monastir, to the River Struma. This
j represents an irregular line nearly 150
j miles long.
j Gen. Sarrail is directing the united
i operations of the allies, with Gen. Cordonnier
commanding the French. The
operations have been long expected
as a part of the allies' co-ordinated offensive
of all fronts. They fellow the
arrival of Gen. Cordonnier after extended
conferences with officials here.
Advices received in Paris indicate
that the Germans and Bulgarians are
seeking to anticipate the movement by
j taking the offensive on the left, where
j the Serbians had moved up to within
j twenty-flve miles of Monastir, holding
! Fiorina as an observation post. Their
| orders were not to attempt to retain
! Fiorina if they were attacked. The
; Serbian war office says the Bulgarians
| were thrown back on the old positions,
' but that later the Serbians, following
instructions, evacuated Fiorina, which
the Bulgarians then occupied.
A dispatch from Saloniki says the
Greek inilitaary authorities have
agreed Ao withdraw their troops from
eighteen villages near the frontier.
Consternation at Athens.
ATHENS, August 19, via London, August
21.?The Bulgarian occupation of
Fiorina caused consternation in the
capital and hasty conferences of the
king, the general staff and members of
i the cabinet.
I The advance of the German and Bulj
garian forces in the direction of Kavala
also is causing disquiet, although the
: impression is general that this move
ment is a mere political maneuver cal
culated to influence Rumania and af,
fed the Greek elections.

UNFAIR TAXATION
OF INTANGIBLES
t
No Increase of Personalty Tax

and Business Taxes.
# \
CITY TOTAL TAX BURDEN
ALREADY HEAVY ENOUGH
^
To Work Equitable Tax Readjustment
Decreases of Excessive Realty
and Business Taxes Must Be
Simultaneous With Increase
of Personal Tax Burden.
BY THEOBOKE W. NOYES.
Editorial Correspondence of The Star.
If a tax on Intangibles la Imposed in
' Washington, It should be in readjust- !
ment and not in Increase of the aggregate
local tax harden, which the Joint
congressional committee, after thor- 1
ongh consideration, has declared to be j
heavy enough, no more than which can :
equitably be exacted.
In any readjustment of this tax burden
the wishes of the' unrepresented
taxpayers should be given primary consideration.
Provided the necessary
amount of tax revenue Is raised, the
forms of taxation should be those to
which the people are accustomed,
which, from habit, seem .to them the
least burdensome, and which for this
reason, It may safely be assumed, they
prefer.
In substituting a tax on Intangibles
for some other tax now locally applied,
care should be taken that the new tax |
is fairer and more effective, causing I
less friction than the one for which it
is substituted. In this connection consideration
should be given to the fact
that the tax on Intangibles Inevitably
lacks uniform application; that a tax
on Invisible property falls the lightest
on those who are most expert in swindling
concealment and heaviest on the
truthful and the honest.
II) In the Interest of equity and of:
the small taxpayers, a tax on intan- 1
glhles. if one Is imposed, should be at |
such a low rate as not to drive away 1
property, leaving thl* new tax to fall !
on men of moderate mean* who are i
tied to Wa*hlngton and cannot eaeape.
(2| In the Interest of the man of
am all meaua. the borrower rather than
the lender, double taxation of the aame |
property, aa in eaae of a tax on mart- |
gage*, ahonld be avoided.
(3) If It ia decided that a light rate
of tax on Intangible* mnat equitably be
Impoaed, the taxea omitted In the readjustment
ahould be carefully aeleeted
aa thoae leaat equitable.
(a) The exceaalve realty tax might
be aomewhat relieved, primarily In the !
Intereat of the mnaft p?up f ly holder. !
by the exemption from taxation (aa In ,
Xew Zealand I of aeveral thouaand dol- ;
lara of realty Improvement*.
(b) The licenae taxea on oecupatlona. ;
more burdenaome here than In moat
eltlea, might well be reduced or eliminated.
(e| The rate of the tax on the groaa
earning* of hanlta and truat eompa- '
niea ia much higher than In other eltlea.
It ia higher than the rate Impoaed here :
on public utility corporatlona, which ,
enjoy (aa the hanking Inatitutlona do ;
not), valuable exelualve privilege* !
from the public. The rate Impoaed on |
the public utilitlea corporation* la itaelf .
high compared with similar taxea In
other eltlea. The plaineat equity de- 1
man da that the rate of thl* tax on
banka and truat companlea ahould be ;
materially reduced.
The wlaeat, falreat treatment of the 1
tax qneatlon would be to make no j
change until after a careful consideration
by a Joint committee of all the
equltlea and all fhe facta. But If the
ha*ty action of the Senate compel* an
Immediate readju*tment, Washington
petition* f'ongre** to make auch readjustment
approximately wise and fair,
and to (hi* end to give sympathetic j
consideration to every rcawonalile ?ug- j
geation of what equity demand*.
Our Aggregate Tax Burden Cannot j
Equitably Be Increased.
The greatest benefit which the District j
derived from ;he investigation? of the
joint congressional committee was the !
result i rig careful and thorough com pari- !
won of the tax burdens of American cities, j
measured bv the right slant's id, arid the j
deliberate decision, announced by the j
committee, that the Wvhingtonian's city j
tax burden is, in the aggregate, as large !
as that imposed in comparable American j
cities, and thai, therefore, no more than j
this aggregate should equitably be ex- |
acted. i
What was before the joint committos j
upon which to base this just conclusion? |
Chairman Chilton said in the Senate de- i
ua ie mai inn n'.ausuuai iounaRiioii 01 i
tiie committee's conclusions was "the ]
complete report" concerning comparative j
taxation, which begins at page 207 of the '
Report of the Hearings of the Joint Com- |
mittee. The census office figures, thus {
adopted and treated as authoritative by j
the joint committee, are those utilized in i
this correspondence.
The census items of the aggregate city !
tax burden are (1) realty taxes. (2) personalty
taxes, and (3) "other" taxes, including
"business" taxes.
In the District the realty tax has always
been high and the personalty tax low. In
1902 Congress stiffened the personalty tax,
put life and force into the law and largely
increased the revenue from such taxes.
At the instance of the Senate, however,
no lax was placed upon intangibles, but
many and laxgc license taxes on
occupations, and heavy taxes on
the gross earnings of public utilities
and banking corporations were
substituted in its place. If the tax on
intangibles, omitted in 1902 at the Senate's
instance, is now, also at the Senate's
instance, to be restored, the substitute
for the tax on intangibles, which In 1902
was enacted, should now, in fairness, be
eliminated or correspondingly reduced.
This readjustment is rendered equitable
not only by what occurred in 1902. but
by the very recent decision to which I
have referred, by the authorized agent of
Congress, the joint committee, that the
aggregate tax burden of the District
iwithout regard to its separate items) is
aireau huiucichuj anu snouiu not
be increased.
I,et us analyze some of the comparative
figures which were submitted
to the joint committee and which
convinced it that Washington was already
as heavily tax-burdened in the
aggregate as other comparable cities,
and thdt this total burden could not
equitably be made heavier.
In comparing the items constituting
the total city tax burden?that is,
realty, personalty and "other" taxes it
is necessary to explain that while
at the District building and In other
municipalities such a tax as that on
the gross earnings of public utilities
and some other corporations Is treated
as a personal tax on the franchises of
these corporations, In the census
office, on the contrary, these taxes are
classified, not as taxes on personalty
but as "business taxes," with the extraordinary
and paradoxical result
that Washington, which, as compared
with^the great coinmr-Hsi cities, cn-'
ioys^ minimum of bJjW^ess, is burI

[ Let us trace the factors in the makei
up of the tax burdens in this small list
of large cities and compare them. In
total tax burden, however measured, |
the eleven cities find themselves very j
close together, but there is considerable i
variation in the weight of different ele- |
ments of this burden. For instance, j
Washington's burden is heavily on j ,
realty (14.62). lightly on personalty j'
(1.38) and heavily on "other taxes"
(4.02), on account of the census inclu- '
sion under this head (instead of under
personal taxes) of the tax on the gross
earnings of public utilities ami some
other corporations. Its heavy tax on ?
realty exceed?? that of all the other ten
cities When personalty tax is added,
five cities godhead of it on the total-?
Chicago, Cleveland. Milwaukee. Newark
and Minneapolis?leaving Philadelphia.
Baltimore. New Orleans, Indianapolis
and Louisville still behind it. When receipts
from all municipal taxes are
compared. Washington goes ahead
again of all the cities but Chicago.
Comparison With Many Cities.
If we broaden tlie range of cities to '
be compared with Washington the les- !
son taught by the comparisons Is the i
?iame: Washington bears a very heavy
realty tax, a very light personalty tax. ,
about the average of the property tax.
including really and personalty, and ?
\ery heavy business" taxes; making 1
its aggregate of per capita municipal :
taxes, Its total city tax-burden, to ex- <
; cced most other comparable cities.
Thus compare Washington with the (
other fffcy-seven American cities hav- 1
ing over 100,000 population. (Group A 1
of the joint committee tables.) Ten of
these cities have a larger realty per
capita tax levy and forty-seven a
smaller.
Of the group of neighboring cities
(Group 1)?Baltimore, Richmond, Wilmington,
Norfolk. Wheeling, Huntington,
Roanoke, Portsmouth and Lynchburg,
not one has so large a per capita A
realty tax as Washington. Nor has any 1
one of the southern group (Group 2)? c
New Orleans. Atlanta, Birmingham, San {
Antonio. Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth,
Savannah. Jacksonville, Charleston, ,
Mobile and Little Rock. Nor has any j
one of the northern-central or middle y
western group (Group 3)?Chicago, <
Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cincln- ,
indlan'ii itnl i s. 1 .oil ixvi 11#? fnlnm.
bun. Toledo. Memphis, Dayton. Grand
ltapids and Nashville.
When personal tjtxes are added to
realty taxes to constitute the total
property tax the per capltas vary materially
on account of Washington's
light personal tax. Of the fifty-seven
cities of Group A twenty-foi$- have a
higher per capita tax and thirty-three
a lower. Of the neighboring cities one
is higher and eight lower; of the southern
cities two are higher and ten are
lowv. and of the northern-central
group five are higher and eight are
lower.
Another step, adding all other city
taxes to those on realty and personalty,
causes eleven cities of Group A to show
a higher per capita of total city tax receipts
and forty-six a lower. None of the
neighboring or southern group of cities
has a larger per capita under this head,
and only two of the thirteen northerncentral
cities.
These comparisons are summarised
vividly in the following table:

Washington's total city tax burden n
is declared by the joint congressional
committee to be heavy enough, not e
equitably to be increased. The Senate rr
has now noted the fact disclosed by t<
the above table that Washington per- a
sonalty contributes less toward the c,
total tax than in many other cities, e
because Congress in 1902 refrained Sj
from taxing intangible personalty and ti
imposed instead extraordinarily heavy tl
license taxes and taxes on the gross p
earnings of certain corporations. The y
Senate now proposes that Congress
shall increase Washington's personalty a
tax contribution in conformity with f
the percentage of such taxes con- p
tributed in other cities. If Congress o
increases this tax to conform to the
practice in other cities, must it, not
also in equity reduce Washington's
pxcessive realty tax contribution and
its "other taxes" contribution to con- *'
form also to the practice in other 11
cities? u
If the proper aggregate tax burden r
is carried what difference does it "
make to anybody out of Washington
whether the capital community meets *
that obligation with a heavy tax on
realty and on business and a ligfct tax ?*
on personaltj', or with a heavy tax on
personalty and a lighter tax on realty ?
and on business? *
Surely it is not proposed by alien ?
tax gatherers,' by a taxing body in a
which Washington taxpayers are not u
represented, to exact from the helpless *
capital community every form of tax
applied in any other American city B,
and under ea<^h tax to burden the b
Washington taxpayer with the high-'it
est rate anywhere Imposed. J a
Washington bears a heavier per cap- r<
ta aggregate city tax burden than u
Cleveland, Baltimore, Milwaukee and tl
-oulsville. What difference does it b.
nake that its personalty contributes C
nuch less toward this total ' burden rs
han the personalty in these other cities u
f its realty and business taxes con- tl
:ribute far more? - b;
And will any legislative body, enleavoring
to do equity, increase Wash- h.
ngton's personalty tax burden to the tl
joint endured in these other cities j p<
vithout at the same time reducing the c;
-ealty tax and the business taxes to ti
conform to those imposed in these a>ther
cities? ^
Ought not a community to meet Its w
tax obligations by the methods 'which lo
It prefers f Does not every self-taxing
community exercise this privilegef
Ought not Congress |n taxing the un- a
represented Dlstrlet to ascertain Its y
wishes In respect to forms of taxation, p
md approximate conditions to those ^
which would exist If the capital com- p
minify ivrrr srii-inxing r t8
If the District wished to raise its P
lecessary revenue by a single tax on 11
and values should it not on American
irinciples be permitted to do so? Why n
ihould it not be permitted to raise this P
lecessary revenue in the way to which 11
t is accustomed by a- heavy tax on 11
ealty and business and a light tax on a'
lersonalty until it asks itself for a r<
eadjustment? It. is perfectly natural lr
'or a congressman to think that the
ibjects and rates of taxation of his Is
>wn city are those which should apply P;
n the nation's city, and .to declare, for P
nstance: "My constituents pay a tax cl
in intangibles; there is no reason why A
Vashingtonians should not be similarly s<
axed." But. as we have seen from i"1
he census figures, there are no two *
American cities which tax the same b(
ibjects and at the same rates. It is P<
mpossible tor Washington's tax scbed- m
lie to conform to all of the widely oi
ind radically varying schedules of tf
ither American cities. Since It cannot A
:onform to all it should not be required g
o conform to any. Its equitable total a]

axation it must, in order) to be fair,
Ive the relief from excessive and inquitable
taxes at the same moment
hat it adds the new tax upon intangiles.
Senator Oallinger pointed out the
xtraordinary and excessive license
axes imposed in the District, and'sugested
that, they -should he reduced or
liminated if the tax on intangibles
fere to be imposed. In the same conection
a reduction of the excessive
ealty taxes, especially in their appli
ation to small prbperty owners, was
uggested. And running through the
rhole Senate debate was the thought,
ot of an increase of the tax burden of
he small property owner and taxay
er, but a readjustment of this
urden, which, so far as he is conerned,
should cause it to be even more
asily borne. But if the promised redjustment
is to be carried out in good
aith the offsetting decreases in taxalon
must be made simultaneously with
he increases. If the latter #ire ended
now, and the former are postoned,
they are likely never to be
lade.
It may be possible to adjust the presnt
District tax burden more equitably,
lore uniformly, with greater fairness
3 the small property owner. This redjustment
should not be attempted or
arried out in such clumsy and inquitable
fashion that the result is
imply to increase for everybody, small
axpayers and large .taxpayers alike,
he over-heavy tax burden now iloosed.
The broad principle upon which
Washington rests.its petition in equity
i that if a tax on intangibles is ended
for the District it should be so
ramed as to be a readjustment of the
acal tax burden and not an Increase
f it.
All of the facts and figures demontrate
that Washington's light personlty
tax, due to the exemption of Intangibles.
Is more than offset by the
leavter tax on realty, and by heavier
business taxes" than ,ln comparable
Itles. and that If revenues from peronalty
taxes (which are now lighter
ban In comparable American cities)
re Increased as proposed there should
e a corresponding reduction in the
xcesslve realty tax (as by the exemplon
from taxation of a limited amount
f realty Improvements) and by cutting
own or eliminating the burdensome IIense
taxes on occupations, including
reduction of the excessive and lneq1
table rate of taxation on the gross
nrnlngs of banks and trust companidh.
Usually Americans tax themselves for
peciflc purposes, in the way most easily
orne by them, with an accurate adjustjent
of rate and assessment to raise
r nearly as possible the exact amount
sauired. Here the necessary tax total
nder the law Is one-half of the amount
lat Congress is willing: to authorize to
? expended each year on the National
apital. Washington is accustomed to
Use this amount by a heavy realty tax,
nder an assessment much higher than ,
\at of the average American city, and
y a comparatively light personal tax.
This method of taxation imposes, as we
ave seen, a net burden of tax levy upon
le Washingtonian heavier than that imDsed
upon the vast majority of Ameriin
cities containing: over 30,000 populaon
and at least as heavy as that of the
verage American city, approximating :
Washington in population ; and this tax
astern raises the amount of revenue
hich is and will be required from the :
cal taxpayers under the organic act.
Why change this system to which ,
ixpayers have become accustomed
nd which raises the needed revenue?
Why increase the comparatively light
ersonal tax burden, for instance, unsss
a corresponding reduction is pro- ,
osed in the excessively high real es- i
Lte tax burden? Why vote that the
ersonal tax assessment be extended to
^tangible personal property, if the
>cal taxpayers prefer that the reve- ]
ues be raised from realty and tangible j
ersonal property taxes instead, on the
leory that these taxes are the fairest,
le most uniform, the most easily and .
dcurately ascertained, and the most 1
jadily collected of any that could be i
nposed? Why should not Congress, i

V
Fifty railroad presidents who
are now in Washington are again
in conference with President Wilson
at the White House this afternoon.
They went to the White
House at 2130 o'clock at the
urgent request of the President,
though they had not expected to
see him today and probably not
tomorrow. The President's invitation
came to them shortly after
noon when they were discussing
the situation with the newly arrived
western railroad leaders. <.
The railroad executives went into
the White House conference determined
to make no statement ?
unless they were urged to do so
by the President.
Cause for Conference.
The cause for calling: the conference
today, according to White House sentiment,
is that the President may have a
chance to talk directly to the more recent
arrivals, impressing them with his
own personality and zeal for sr settlement
before theii^ minds have been
prejudiced against his proposal in conferences
with the other railroad ofllciala
It is not expected that there will be
any final reply made by the railroad
executives today. No definite action is
expected. The impression gained
strength today, however, that some
time this week, and probably by Wednesday.
the railroad officials will have
been persuaded to submit to the President's
proposal with some modifications.
Other Officials Arrive.
More than a dozen railroad leaders
reached Washington today and participated
in conferences striving to
reach some agreement by which the
President's main proposal for an eighthour
basic day may be accepted, and
at the same time the principle of arbitration
may be preserved and the
threatened strike averted.
There were fifty railroad presidents
here today. Among the latest arrivals
were Louis W. Hill of the (Ireat Northern.
son and principal heir of the vast
.properties of the great railroad builder,
the late James J. Hill, and E. P. Ripley,
the veteran president of the Sante Fe.
dean of all the railroad presidents, who
is seventy-one years old.
Leaders of the railroad executives
declared they were united against the
I President's plan as it stands, but hoped
j to work out some form of counter proposal
that would satisfy the President
and be accepted by the brotherhood
committee. The railroad presidents'
were considering under what circumstances
they could find a way to aocept
the eight-hour day and still maintain
the principle of arbtiration. which
is now the crux of the whole fight.
The western men arriving today
seemed confident that such a middle
course might be reached through slncere
efforts# on both sides to reach a
compromise*that will preserve the public
welfare.
Proposed Commission.
One suggestion the railroad presidents
were prepared to make at the
White House was for legislation to
create a board or commission to investigate
when trouble threatens between
railway employers and employes.
Under such a plan the board would
be created by act of Congress, and
would probably be empowered to examine
witnesses to determine the
merits of any controversy. Pending
its investigation the employes would
not be permitted to strike or to take
a strike vote. After the board had
reached its conclusions from the facts
a public report would be made and
there would be an opportunity for ar
miration, uui n wuuiu nui ue compulsory.
If arbitration were refused
the board would send to each employe
of the railroad interested a statement
of the railroad's position in the matter,
the employes' position and the
board's findings- These statements
would be before every employe when
he came to vote on a strike, and opportunity
would be given for a secret
ballot. The men would vote directly
on the question of a strike. Under
the present system the balloting is
not secret, and the men vote to delegate
the power of declaring a strike
to brotherhood officers.
"Seriotu, But Not Hopeless."
As both sides expressed it, the situstion
continued "serious but not hopeless."
All the western presidents are expected
before tomorrow. There will be
between sixty and one hundred, depending
on whether the President invites
all of the list of seventy laid before
him by the committee of managers.
When they are assembled they
will represent here properties valued ?
at more than $10,090,000,000, and will
be in this respect the most Imposing
delegation mat nas visited tne White
House In many years.
Among the railroad executives arriving
today were E. F. Kearney, president
of the Wabash; C. E. 8chall, president
of the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas; Jacob M. Dlcfane^, former
Secretary of .Wax, xJbe Is if Um
