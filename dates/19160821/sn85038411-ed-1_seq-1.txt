AQUA-PLANING
MAY GIVE FUN
DURING KIPONA
f Meeting of Navy This Evening
to Report Progress of the
! Various Committees
, MEMBERSHIP OVER 200
, Standing, Double Paddle, and
Three-Man Crew Canoe
Race New Feature
Rumors of the presence in Harris- !
burg of a professional expert on the !
popular Hawaiian water sport of aqua
planing has started some local boys
thinking and if the tentative plans of :
the program committee of the Greater
Harrisburg Kipona don't miscarry
there will be some excellent compe
tition on the day of the great carnival.
Yesterday afternoon on the Susque- 1
hannn this famous sport In which the
natives of Honolulu engage on the |
beach at Waikiki was first introduced
into Harrisburg. Men who have trav
eled standing erect on a board behinl
a motorboat going thirty-two miles an
hour, however, are of the opinion that
it would be dangerous to attempt aqua
planing on the river here on account
;of the rocks. And it is doubtful if a
speed boat could be obtained on short
notice that would afTord any excite
*inen t. The matter will be discussed
: at an important meeting of the Navy
it Dir.taman s at S o'clock this even
j ing. A report on entries will also be
made at that time. The committee is
working on the aqua planing feature
| and if it is at all possible an exhibition
will be given.
Standing Canoe Kaec New Feature
An additional feature of the carni
! yal on Labor Day will be a canoe race :
; between two crews of three men each i
. with Richard Rauch in command of ,
i one crew and Harry Lindsev captain- '
;ng the other. The men will be re
j quired to use double paddles from a <
j standing position and the race prom- .
1 ises to be of an exciting variety.
The membership of the Navy was
| increased durins the past week by the i
additional applications of fifty per
| sons, making the total membership of
| the association well over two hundred.
Practicing for War Canoe Kaec
A large number of Technical high
i school students reported at Dinta
j man's this afternoon for practice in
, preparation for the war canoe race,
one of the big events of the carnival.
The large, racy Morris war canoe that,
was ordered tor one of the scholastic
• crews has been completed and will be
shipped by the Morris people as soon '
i as the open-end car arrives that was
j ordered to briusj the boat safely from
! Beazie. Maine, to this city. A. P. ;
. Dintaman received a telegram to this
1 effect from the manager of the com- i
pany.
The Engineers Society will do its
share to assure the success of the
I Kipona in the work of the committee '
i that has been named to co-operate
with tiie general regatta committee,
with the possibility of something
, special on its own responsibility.

"Explosive Blood" Is New
Munitions Workers' Disease
Sftrial to the Telegraph
Baltimore, Aug. 21.—A new disease;
called explosive blood has appeared;
among munition workers. John Rey
; nolds of Baltimore, employed at the,
du Pont Works at Carney Point, N. J.,
: has been treated for the strange ;
i malady in Mercy, and at the City Hos
pital in Bayview. It is true that these
blood explosions are not accompanied i
by deafening detonations; that the
patient s body is not torn asunder by \
the combustion. But the explosions;
; occur just the same. They take place
only in the smallest veins. The ef- j
fects are no more more disastrous.
! than to cause a rather malignant
eruption on the skill of the arms and
i legs. Simultaneously with this strange
condition the patient becomes of a
yellow complexion.
However, complex the malady, the
, treatment is extremely simple and
rapidly effective. It consists solely of
fresh air and a light diet.
Camp Stewart Turned
Into Lake by Storm
El Paso. Tex., Aug. 21.—Torrential
rains, driven by a 35-mile wind, struck
El Paso and the army camp late ves

the plains where the 40.U0U troops were
encamped became rivers,
i Three mess tents in Camp Cotton
J were wrecked and many squad tents
1 were blown away. Camp Stewart. ,
j three miles north of Port Bliss, was
I converted into a lake, into which'
.-treams of water poured from the ad
i jacent mountains. Major General Clem

Tug Captain Denies He
Is Waiting For Bremen
Norfolk. Va., Aug. 21.—The Baltimore;
• tug Hansa. which arrived in Norfolk
Saturday morning, still is tied up at the
* pier of a local coal company* Captain
Cullison declined to see newspaper- !
men.
The Hansa formerly was the Thomas '
F. Timmlns. convoy of the German sub
marine Deutschland, and her presence
here led to rumors that the submarine
Bremen would soon arrive outside the
Virginia capes. Captain Cullison de- >
clared that he was in Norfolk to tow
mud scows up the bay to Baltimore,
and that he would sail as soon as the
northeaster abated. Ideal weather ore- ''

CHAPTER I.
The Amazing Kntrance
The wine-born laughter softened,
ceased; blatancy became solemn hush.
The life and color of the big restau
rant seemed chilled, as though some
icy w'nd had come, unheralded, to
destroy. Jewel-panoplied women
lowered their eyes, only to raise them
again and stare. The movements of
the waiters, silent always, seemed
more ghost-like than ever. The ring
ing click of silver on china was stilled
as diners forgot food, to watch the
three persons who were entering the
big dinlngroom of the Beaumonde.
It was the man who attracted the
eye first; it was the woman who held
it. The third of the trio was merely
a waiter, whose arm through the
man's arm helped support him as he
walked through the aisle of tables

Thief Who Stole Kadaks
Returns to Gettysburg
Drugstore For Films
Special to the Telegraph
Gettysburg. Pa.. Aug. 21.—The thief
who entered Huber's drug store on
Thursday night and took nine kodaks,
not molesting anything else, returned
to the scene of his operations on Sat
urday night, forcing his way through
a rear door. He was evidently so
much pleased with the cameras ob

that he would use them, and made his
second visit to obtain films and de

man appeared intoxicated, until one
saw that his chin was held high, and
that his eyes, almost met by the gray
streaked brown whiskers that came
halfway down his vest, stared straight
ahead of him unblinkingly. But his
whole weight seemed supported by the
locked arms of the waiter and the
woman.
It was the woman who brought the
hush; the chill. Tall she was, regally
erect, gowned in black satin, with a
wide, silver girdle that accentuated
the sheen of the silk strikingly. But

JITNEY MEASURE
Three Lnlicensed Jitneurs Ask
Court For Injunction of
Restraint
Three owners of unlicensed jitneys
this morning petitioned Judge Charles

ily presiding in the Dauphin county
' court, asking for an injunction, to re
strain Mapor E. S. Meals, Chief of Po
lice J. Thomas Zeil, and other city offi
cials from enforcing the jitney ordln
ance, the injunction to be preliminary
' until hearing and to be perpetual
i thereafter. The petitioners are C. D.
: Houck. W. L. Grimes and R. H. Wolfe.
Most vigorous protest against grant
, ing the Injunction was made by City
Solicitor D. S. SeiU.
i Judge Henry continued the hear-
I in* until 10 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing. This afternoon City Solicitor Seitz
filed a demurrer to the request for the
I injunction, raising legal points which
; wi|l be argued by the attorneys at the
hearing to-morrow morning.
, Both local judges. Judges Kunkel

: Henry is presiding here in their ab
sence. The Lebanon county jurist
several times announced his desire to
make an early disposal of all disputed

peared informally as the legal repre

party to the proceeding considered to
day by the court, he probably will
tuke a hand in the affair should the

With Details of Dispute
Washington, Auk. 21. The rail
road presidents and their committee
;of managers worked steadilv to-day
to devise some means of averting the
i threatened strike which would in
the main accept President Wilson's
; plan but at the same time preserve the
principle of arbitration.
Leaders of the railroad executives
declared they were united asainst the
President's plan as it stands and hoped
to agree on some form of counter pro
posal.
The railroad presidents were con
sidering under what circumstances
1 they could find a way to accept the
eight-hour day basis and still conserve
the principle of arbitration which has
become the crux of the whole light.
Western railroad presidents arriving
seemed confident that a way would be
found to avert the strike. No confer
ence between President Wilson and
railway executives is expected before
to-morrow afternoon.

Dr. Lockhart was returning from a

a revolver. Four bullets entered the
physician's breast, one penetrating the
heart. The fifth struck the right leg

JAPS AFTER BIG
LAND CONCESSIONS
IN CANAL ZONE?
State Department Investigating
Report That Spaniard Is
Intermediary in Deal
WANT 60,000 ACRES
Believed Private Interests Are
Seeking Plot to Establish
Base For Storing Coal
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Aug:. 21.—Inves
tigation of reports from Panama that
a 60,000-acre land concession at the
Atlantic end of the canal is being
sought ' j a Spaniard named Fernan
idez, presumably for Japanese interests
was ordered to-day by Secretary Lans
ing.
Mr. Lansing refused to discuss the
report in details but it was considered
significant that the department should
j commence its action. Rumors of a
similar nature have been common ever
i since the canal was well under way,
j but it was not till several months ago
that they reached a well defined out
line. At that time it was commonly
believed tn diplomatic circles that pri
vate Japanese shipping interests were
seeking land through Spanish Inter
mediaries to establish a base for stor
ing coal at lower rates than could be
had from the American government
, monopoly base. So far as known noth
j ing definite came of that plan.
The present reports are that Fer
nandez, Havana agent for Japanese In
terests. secured a SO.OOO-acre land con
cession through the activity of Ramon
Yaldes whose recent election to the
] presidency of Panama may possibly be
disputed by the United States because
of alleged frauds and coercion.
Admiral Concas, of the Spanish
Navy, selected by the Panama govern
ment as umpire to settle the dispute
with the United States over the pur
chase of canal property is alleged to
have given very valuable information
about the canal itself.
