Sixty Thousand Acres.
Washington, Aug. 21. Investigation
of reports from Panama that a 60,000
acre land concession at the Atlantic
end of the canal is being sought by a
Spaniard named Fernandez, presum
ably for Japan interests, was ordered

nandez, Havana agent for Japanese in
terests, secured a 60,000 acre land con
cession through the. activity of Ramon
Valdes, whose recent election to the
presidency of Panama may possibly be
disputed by the United States because
of alleged frauds. Admiral Conas of
the Spanish navy, selected by Panama
as umpire to settle the dispute with
the United States over the purchase
price of canal property, is alleged to
have given this informamation about
the canal itself.

houses, fled .and were placed in the
hands of the Central Trust Company
of Illinois as receiver today.

not be determined until the receivers
examine the books and open the safe
ty deposit boxes.

licemen were rushed to one of the Sil
ver banks today when nearly one thou
sand persons made what looked like
an attempt to storm the building. Or

after bricks had been hurled by the
depositors. Six were arrested.
Work of examining the safety de
posit boxes will be begun tomorrow.
