COMPULSORY

WINS WILSON
President Amazed at
WeaRness of Board
of Mediation.
CANADIAN PLAN
MEETS FAVOR
Through Commission He
Hopes to Find Basis for
Permanent Peace.
trrom Th. Trihue. Hur.au I
Washington, Aug. 20. I'resident Wil
son has been won over to the principle
of compulsory arbitration. That is the
interpretation that ir. well informed
qiiartcrs is placed on his telejrram to
George Pope, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers, who ap
pealed to him in behalf of all employ?
ers not to ahandon the principle of
arbitration in mediation of the threat?
ened railroad strike.
"I hold to the principle of arbitra?
tion with as clear a conviction and as
tirm a purpose as any one," the Presi?
dent telegraphed to-day in reply, "but,
unfortunately, there is no means now
in existence by whieh arbitration can
be secured."

The I'resident ii nnderttood to looK
w.th m?eh favor on the lyiUffl of
compulsory arbitration in use in l an
ada. Although this has been advo
cated for veara bv aeflflOmiltl and stu
dcnts of the iaboi problem, it has never
found followers among employers or
labor unions, both of whom have pre?
ferred their own ways of settling dis
putea. 'Ihe plan was advanced in Cflfl
tT?,a three years ago, but it. Wfll
deemed ?oo radieal a step and under
the Ncwlands act, the United States
Mediation Board was offered as a sub

How Canada Arbitratei.
Brieflv. the ("anadiar. seheme pro?
vides a compulsory truce between labor
and eapital for a specil.ed time dur?
ing which a public commission is to
jnvestigate the rnerits of the dispute.
Not. until the tindings of this boanl
have heen published can either side
take the next step. Thus in a situa
tion like the present railway crisis the
public would have a period of per
hr.n? a year to mform itself on the.
rnerits of the eight-hour day and upon
the trutn of the railways' contention
as to its coat.
Inster.d of merely considering tne
claims of both sides, as i| now thfl
case on which to determine the ver- I
diet there would be an impartial rec- [
ord'of fscts on which to set a base.
line of truth. Any side that chose to
disobev that verdict, would do so at
the ris"k of public disapproval and pos- |
sible rctaliation. , .
Indeed, it would not be surprmng
to political observers here. should the
President make the prevention of any
similar industrial crisis in the future
the issue of the camnaign. Not that
he would attempt to capitalue what-;
ever settlement is eventually effected
'or gains on one side are likely to be ,

President Firm for Arbitration;
Can't Force It in R. R. Fight
Wathingtan, Aug. 10.- Prttuieni WUttm deelared hit attitude
toward arbitrntion tf labor dujomte* m thc following trleciram, sent
lo-dai/ to denrae 1'ope, president of the \atioual .ts.tociation of
Manafaetarere, m response tn nn appeal fnr arhitratinn in the
railroad quarrrl:
Allow mn to aeknowledge the receipt of your
telegram of Aupust 18. and to say in reply that I
holrl to tho principle of arbitration with as clear a
convictlon and as firm a purpose as any one, but
that. unfortunatelv. there is no means now in ex?
istence by which arbitration can be secured. The
existing means have been tried and have failed.
This situation must never be allowed to arise
again, but it has arisen. Some means must be
found to prevent its recurrence. but no means can be
found otThand or in a hurry or in season to meet the
present national emergency.
What I am proposing does not weaken or dis
credit the principle of arbitration. It strengthens
it rather It proposes that nothing be conceded ex?
cept the eight-hour day. to which the whole eeo?
nomic movement of the time seems to point. and the
immediate creation of an agency for rietermining
all the arbitrable elements in this case in the light
not of predictions or forecasts. but of establisned
and ascertainoc facts.
This is the first stage of the direct road to the
discoverv of the best permanent basis for arbitra?
tion when other means than those now available are
supplied.

After a moment he brightened.
"Hut maybe he isn't here," he said.
"I'll make sure."
Making sure lifted the information

there had been no deception practised
upon him. Henry Ford was certainly
not in the Biltmore.
Bellhops paged "Mr. Forbes," "Mr.
Force" and other persons with like
sounding names to no avail.
A room clerk with an honest faee was
appealed to.
"Henry Ford*" he echoed. "Well,

Washington, Aug. 20>.?-It is tt\*
confident opinion of the railroad ex?
ecutives and managers who refused
to accede to President Wilson's pla.i
rf averting the impending nation
wide railway strike by granting aa
e-ght-hour day with pro rata over?
time that the other railroad presi?
dents now on the way to Washin?.
tr n will merely strenptnen the stand
they have taken for arbitration of
tiie whole controversy. Most of the
other executives summoned to the
White House will be here to-mor?
row, but it is unlikely that all will
j.rrive in time to meet the Pre.i
(ient before Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a sensational report,
generally credited among the rail?
road presidents at the capital, but
di-nied emphatically at the White
House, served to illustrate the de?
termined attitude of the railway of?
ficials. This report was that the
President's trump card probably
would be a threat of temporary gov?
ernment operation of all the roads
involved in a possible strike. Th.'
answer of tho railway heads was:
"Let the I'l'-sulei _ t.y i'_."
President Firm for Fight-Hour Day.
The railroad executives have .10
doubt, however, that some such move
will be taken unlc.ss President Wil
BOO swerves from his present course
or the roads themselves capitulate.
The companies have been given c>
un.lcrstan.l that the President is de?
termined to force them to a.lop *ha
(itrht-hour day. Hfl has c-.pous^l
that feature of the unions' demands,
and no one iielievcs f.ir a ___flflM__6
that he will attempt a compromiso
on a different basis or that the four
railway brotherhoods will nccept .x
settlement without the eifht-hour
provisi-i.
If any one held a shred of belief
that some other basia of settlement
might be found, President Wilson him?
self ahattered it to-d?y in the tele
pram 5ent to George Pope, preaident
of the National Association of Manu
faeturers, who asked the President In
? mes-'age received at the White
House on Fridav not to diacard the
principle of arbitration. The Preai?
dent informed Mr. Pope that he held
to that principle "with aa elear a con
viction and as firm a purpose aa any
one."
Big Sjstema Oppoae WUflflfls*! Pl?n.
The question arose to-day whether
three or four of the larger railroad
systems of the coun'ry might be able
by their mfluenc*. to swing the other
railroad executives to their way of
thinking. It was suggested that tha
Pennsylvania, Great Northern 1 the
Hill interests) and the N'ew York Cen?
tral might perhaps control the d?
liberations 01 al! the hundred execu?
tives, who are expected to be in Wash?
ington by Tuesday morning. Theaa
three ayatems are seemingly unalter
ably opposed to the President's plan.
"There will be no such control of
the situation," sairl L. F. Loree, preai
dent of tho Delaware __ Hudson
Company. "It will be a general dis
cussion and we shall undoubtedly act
together."
Just what that aetion w:Il be was as
uncertain to-night as it ever had beon.
It would seem prepoaterous to believe
that the arrival of the other executives
whom President Wilson had summoned
lo the White House to help break thfl
deadlock would change the situation.
The expressiona of opinion of most of
the railway leaderi ir.dicated just the
opposite. Two of the leaders in mind
are F. P. Kipley, preaident of the
Atchison, Topeka __ Santa Fe, and
Louis W. Hill, head of the Great North?
ern.
Federal Reeeiverahip Se*n.
Mr Hill and Mr. Ripley are expected
to reach Washington early in tht
morning. Things are expected to hjtu
more than ever in the railroad camp.
Mr. Hill aaid yesterday that, no mat?
ter what roads capitulatad, hia would
not, and that the eight-hour day meant
Federal receivership for most of thfl
country'fl railroads. Mr Ripley baeked
him up to-day in a atatement that cann

fiant mood. He could not see why b*
