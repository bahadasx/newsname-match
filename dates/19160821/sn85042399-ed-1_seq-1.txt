Republican Nominee for President
Favorably Impresses Gathering
The rain which had deluged the
city for two solid hours ceaBed
abruptly, the clouds broke away and
the sun shone from a sky of southern
Oregon blue as the train bearing
Charles B. Hughes, republican nomi
nee for president, whistled Into the
Ashland yards.
A crowd of about fifteen hundred
people from ABhland and vicinity
were gathered on the platform and
lawns at the station, enlivened be
fore the arrival of the train by the
Ashland band, which marched from
the business section to the station.
When Mr. Hughes appeared on the
platform a cheer arose, and as he
was escorted to an automobile In the
center of the assemblage the throng
surged In closely.
S. S. Smith Introduced Mr. Hughes
as "the next president of the United
states," and a silence fell over the
gathered voters as the man from the
east smiled out over the crowd with
the words, "It Is good to be here."
As his vision swept the mountains
surrounding Ashland, vivid and clear
cut after the drenching rain, . the
great republican seemed to forget
such things as politics and launched
Jnto an appreciation of all Oregon
and the Rogue River valley In partic
ular. He finally turned to the subjects
which the crowd had come to hear,
saying: "It always was my belief
that it is what you do in office, not
the mere attainment of office, that
counts." Escaping steam from an
engine In the yards was shut off and
a quiet even more still than that at
midnight, when the switch engine is
"on spot" and the yards are empty,
prevailed while the man whom Ore
gon gave the highest tribute any
state could pay, plead for a loyalty
to flag and to country. He stated:
"I am a firm believer in a reasonable
preparedness, and am I elected I
shall certainly insist upon a proper
maintenance of national honor. The
best ability of our country Is needed
and should be enlisted In the diplo
matic service. Nothing is too good
for the American public."
With a slight reference to condi
tions today Mr. Hughes asked: "Why
can we not have a government run
without waste and without extrava
gance? The present administration
has not proper national budget or
financial scheme. 1 want to change
this. I want to organize the finance;
of this country that it may be run
as a great business should be run.
"This country must compete with
the nations of the earth after this
war is over, and the competition will
be close and keen. When the mil
lions of men who are now fighting
In Europe lay down their arms and
return to peaceful pursuits, It will
be with better organized industries
awaiting then and they themselves
better prepared to do their share.
The United States must be prepared
for this competition of peace as well
as the possibility of war. And this
preparation must come through the
Inauguration of the republican doc
' trine of protection to American in
dustry. The present administration
have had a theory of government
which did not work. They needed a
European war to help them out. If
we are going to compete with the
nations of the world successfully, we
must do It with a sound policy and
by all working together."
Frequent bursts of applause inter
rupted the speech, which was re
ceived with an intense interest and
appreciation of its substantial na
ture, unadorned by oratorical out
bursts which are so often resorted to
with the Intention of arousing en
thusiasm. Mr. Hughes talk was dis
cussed in a great many Ashland
homes and left much food for sober
thought with his hearers.
Following his talk, the distin
guished visitor held an Informal re
ception for ten minutes, shaking
hands with several hundred, paying
particular attention iu iuo
children who were "lifted up to shake
hands with the next president.' Mrs.
Hughes also greeted a, number of
Ashlanders, she having remained
seated in the car with Mr. Hughes
during his talk.
The car was loaded down with Ash
land roses, great red, Juicy peaches
and a case of Ashland's famous lithia
water. The ladies' Civic Improve
ment Club, the Gillette springs com
pany and fruit growers contributed
freely.
Mr. Hughes, although he had
passed through a day which was Just
"one little speech after another," did
not seem tired, and, In fact, surprised
i everyone with his smile, his person
ality and his vim.
The arrangements for the success
ful reception given here were made
in the main by Chairman T. H. Simp
son of the republican central commit
tee of Ashland, assisted by other re
publican war horses of the city.
The train was accompanied through
Oregon to Ashland by National Com
mitteeman Ralph Williams, Charles
L. McN'ary, chairman of the state re
publican committee, E. B. Herman,
state committeeman from Douglas
county, and Senator Marsters of Rose
burg. S. S. Smith, state committeeman
from Medford, met the train at Glen
dale and accompanied it here.
As the train pulled out Mr. Hughes
waved from the back platform while
Mrs. Hughes stood beside him, her
arms full of Ashland roses, smiling
a goodbye to Ashland and to Oregon,
a state which against her husband's
wishes nominated him for the presi
dency by a large majority.
Story of Brookings
Is a Big Surprise
Vance Wolgamont, formerly of
Talent, but who has now located at
Brookings, the new town over in
Curry county, "The country God
made and man forgot," was a visitor
in the city Saturday, getting his af
fairs straightened up preparatory to
moving over there permanently. Mr.
Wolgamont Is satisfied that some
wonderful opportunities exist over in
that country and says there is an
ppportunity for any man over there.
The immensity of the operations
which are going on at Brookings
have scarcely been realized. Mr.
Wolgamont states that there are at
present 250 men employed by the
company thrtx In getting ready to
begin lumbering operations, and that
by the first of next year six hundred
men will be at work, all white help,
no foreigners being wanted. The Im
mense sawmill has a capacity of
500,000 feet a day and enough tim
ber is available to- last for twenty
five years at this rate.
One million dollars Is being ex
pended in making a harbor. Every
bit of machinery and freight has been
brought in by cables stretched from
ships anchorage out in the bay to
the cliffs so far, but good harbor fa
cilities will be secured,, although at
enormous cost. .
There are no "bunk houses," a big,
hotel accommodating the help and
being run along up-to-date scientific
lines, aboslutely "the cleanest place
I ever saw," said Mr. Wolgamont.
An Immense tourist hotel, one of
the finest on the coast, is also being
built and will be opened during the
Chetco Cove Carnival in September.
"Of course it is a company-owned
town,' said Mr. Wolgamont, "but they
are ready to provide a building and
help anyone install a business."
Brookings is thirty miles up the
coast from Crescent City and fine
roads exist between the two. Brook
ings is the gateway to the famous
Curry county wilds, which are ac
knowledged to be the most prolific
of game of any of the Oregon moun
tains. It will become a famous out
fitting place for hunting trips.
The Chetco Cove Carnival is to be
a hummer, according to the Talent
man. They are sparing no expense
in the attempt to make the affair the
most unique and one of the greatest
of its kind.
Schumann-Heink
May Buy Ranch
Madame Schumann-Heink will ar
rive in the Rogue River valley within
the week for a few days' stay. She
Is said to be contemplating the pur
chase of a ranch for her son, and
looks with favor upon the Rogue Riv
er valley. Her son has been in the
valley for some time past.
The famous singer is not the first
person of national prominence to pur
chase lands in the state. Thomas W.
Lawson of Boston, Mrs. Eleanor Mar
tin of San Francisco, Mrs. Potter
Palmer of Chicago, Billy Sunday and
many others own vast tracts of tim
ber and farming lands In Oregon.
Marshfield Is to pave ten blocks of
Anderson street. ,
Plan Scandinavian
Band Concert
The Ashland band has in the
course of preparation a concert of
Scandinavian music which will be
presented in the near future, the ex
act date to be announced as soon as
i set.
The Scandinavian concert will be
something so unique and different as
to interest everybody, and at the
same time is fine music. The num
bers selected are the most popular
Scandinavian airs, national melodies,
overtures and light concert numbers,
besides stirring marches, such as are
seldom heard from an American
band. Most of the music Is extreme
ly difficult and much hard practise
is necessary before the band will
feel ready to attempt the concert.
The Scandinavian society of the
valley will attend the concert in a
body.
Large interests are uniting to
build a Mt. Hood highway loop.
Want Thousand People to Climb
Mount Ashland for the Movies
On next Sunday, August 25, it is
hoped to have several hundred, if
possible over a thousand, people
climb Mt. Ashland. It will be "Mt.
Ashland day" for the entire valley.
The purpose of the expedition will be
dual, first to acquaint the people of
Ashland and the valley wth one of
the biggest assets of the valley, Mt.
Ashland, and the delights of the
climb and the view from the top, and
second, to produce some motion pic
tures which will be absolutely unique
and the greatest kind of advertise
ment for the valley. "Movie Man"

Four Hours To
Lake of the Woods
H. L. Sinclair, with a party of four
in his Ford car, made the run to
Lake of the Woods In four hours
yesterday, returning in the same
time. .
Leaving at noon they got out to
the lake by four o'clock, visited for
the best part of an hour with Jack
True and .the road gang, viewed
the lake and were back in town by
9 o'clock in the evening. , Mr. Sin
clair says they took their time and
that the run should take about three
hours and a half under ordinary
conditions.
The roads are reported to be very
good in the main, the only bad spot
being a stretch of very bumpy road
seven miles this side of the lake
through two miles of level plain
which used to be called "Hell's Half
Acre" on account of its semblance
to one big rock pile.
Mr. True told Mr. Sinclair that in
two days this bad stretch would be
fixed and then the road to the lake
will present no difficulties other than
those met on any road. Next Sun
day should see dozens of automo
biles make the trip.

river bed of the Willamette when the
bed was full of water last Wednes
day night. The attempt happened
at Wllsonville from the ferry. The
car lit in twenty feet of water and
went to the bottom, F. L. going part
way down with It. He finally disen
tangled himself and reached the
shore. Me had the car hauled up from
the bottom of the river (the dis
patches neglected to say whether the
engine was still running) and pro
ceeded on his way to Portland. Mr.
Camps told them at Wllsonvllle that
he had been driving a good many
hours and must have gone to sleep.
Also that he did not know the river

Grubb and Alleen Walker made the
trip Sunday. Out near Deadwood
a deer crossed the road right in front
of the car. On the return trip they
came to the summit of Dead Indian
mountain Just as the lights were
coming on in Ashland over at the
base of the great mountains opposite
and proclaim the sight alone to have
been worth the trip.
Former Ashlander

Grant Lands Classification Crew
Louis L. Sharp, chief of the field I
division of the United States Landj
office in the state and in charge of
the crews which are classifying the
Oregon-California grant lands, spent
Sunday in Ashland and is now super
intending the moving of the camps
of his crews. Mr. Sharp stated,
"Wonderful progress is being made,
In fact, the men are plunging into
the work with such speed and under
standing that we are making 50 per
cent better progress than I antici
pated. They are eating It up."
All of the land In Jackson coun
ty east and south of Ashland, has
been covered, and the camps are be
ing moved into the next section to
the north. Headquarters camp has
been moved from Park hurst to a
point on Lake creek, about 25 miles
east of Medford. The sub camps of
which there are five have been estab
lished through the country at the
are in fair shape to Long's cabin nad
good shape from there on up. It is
an easy trip and should hold forth nt
terrors for the car owner. It is
hoped that every owner of a car In
Ashland will take his car up and
carry as many as he can. From the
camp which will be established at
the end of the road it is about five
miles by trail to the summit.

Out of the transportation 75 cents
and contributions of 10 cents from
those who furnish their own means
of conveyance, coffee, sugar and
cream will be purchased and the
mountain climber will be met both
going and returning at the camp with
hot coffee galore. Everyone should
provide their own lunch, and let us
remind you that appetites are keen
in the mountains, so take plenty,
. Start at 3:30
The start will be
made at 5;3fl sharp
from the Plaza. Do

The Austin folks took to the depot
and presented to each of the busi

hit with the visitors, and has created
a good deal of Interest in Ashland.

head of Lake creek, and in the Dead
Indian country, northeast of Ashland.
The division of the county upon
which the crew Is now working will
conclude the work in the eastern
part of Jackson county. When this
portion is finished the crew wilt
move into the section west of Med
ford. From the progress which 18
being made it seems not unlikely
that the lands in Jackson county will
be classified with the next two
months.
The organization of the forces and
of the work is practically completed
and about 100 men are employed al
together including the camp workers
and the transportation forces. One
more camp of cruisers for which Mr.
Sharp stntes he has already selected
the men, will he added and then the
organization will be complete.
One of the most Interesting feat
ures of the system used Is the classi
fication report. These reports werd
originated by Mr. Sharp and form
the basis of the records of classifi
cation. Each cruiser makes out onof
of these reports for each sub-division
of land. The reports are then;
checked up and approved by the crew
foreman, then by Mr. Sharp and for
warded to the Portland Land office
which approves them and forwards
them to Washington, D. C, where
they are filed and form the record
basis. Mr. Sharp says he believes
he has gone over and signed four or
five hundred of these in the past two
or three days.
Of the land which has been cruised
and classified, Mr. Sharp saysr
"There is much valuable timber
land, the greater portion being clas
sified as what I would call valuable
tor the timber which stands on it.
Some of the timber is simply mag
nlflclent. There, is also Borne desir
able agricultural land, but owing to
the high altitude, not as likely to be
. a ii . i i
I preierreu aa mui iu lower yuris ui
: the country." ' '
One of the hardest problems met
has been the transportation of the
camps from one site to another. The
camps necessarily have to be moved
often so that the men will not have
'too far to go from camp before be
I ginning operntlons. Auto trucks have
! been found impractical on the rough
mountain roads. The jumps are too
long, sometimes 50 miles, for horses
j or mules and teaming is loo slow. At
! present light automobiles with de-
llveiy wagon bodies are being used
and have proven fairly satisfactory.
"We have not a single green man
in the whole force," stated Mr.
Sharp, "and the pare which those old
timers set is simply terrific." Hat
went on to tell how two or three of
the compassmen who are mostly;
young fellows, had had quite a time
at first until they got hardened to
the work, and how the old-timers
"crabbed" if anyone lagged.
The cruisers who are working on
the job, the biggest cruising job1
which has probably been tackled on
the Pacific Coast, are absolutely the
pick of the timber cruisers of the
United States. These men know tim
ber like a racing driving knows gaso
line. Mr. Sharp says, "I really did
not expect to be more than under
way by this time, but these fellows
most of them had their lines picked
out before they hit camp and were
In the woods and at work before th..
had unpacked their duffle. It is most
gratifying. There is not a hitch or
a weak cog in the whole organiza
tion. Each of these men was picked
for hia particular job and nobody
has had to be told."
Besides the headquarters camp,
there are five sub-camps, each under
the charge of a foreman. These
five men, according to Mr. Sharp, are
as well known in the timber world
as Battling Nelson Is in the boxing
"world. They are Malcom Doble, W.
F. Slaughter, David Edgar, Charles
V. Mead and Willie Potter, all men
of world-wide reputations and mas
ters of all there Is to know about
timber. Each camp has five cruisers
five compassmen and the cook. The
camps are located from 10 to 12 miles
apart. There are also a few men
who "work loose" picking up the
odds and ends.
Mrs. Sharp came down from Port
land Sunday and left yesterday for
the Lake creek camp with Mr. Sharp.
Mr. Sharp presented her with a fine
rifle purchased here and the boys
in camp count upon "the boss's wife"
to bring in some venison. Mrs. Sharp
is anxious to get out in the hills,
which she loves as well as the most
seasoned timberman.
