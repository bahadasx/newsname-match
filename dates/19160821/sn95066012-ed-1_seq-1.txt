Present Situation.
to
Washington, Aug. 21. Acceptance
of the 8-hour days and the reference
of all other differences to a Commis
sion is understood to be President
Wilson's position on the adjustment
of tho threatened railroad strike.
The president of the different rail
roads have been arriving in the city
all day and a meeting at the White
House was arranged for 2.;iu this af
ternoon.
Washington, Aug. 21. President
Wilson's week of conferences with
ranking officers of the railroads and
leaders of their employes threatening
i nationwide strike is believed by
all parties to the controversy to have
brought the situation to a point where
decisive developments may be expect
ed within a few days. ,
While the negotiations took no actu
al forward Step yesterday, the presi
dent replied indirectly to contentions
of the road officials that the principle
oi armtration would lie endangered oy
his plan in putting the eight hour basis
dav into effect while a committee
would Investigate its practicability
and pass on other points at issue.
In a telegram made public at tho
White House, the president declared
be held lirmly to arbitration, as a
principle and that his plan strengthen
ed rather than weakened it. He also
said that some means must be found
to prevent the existing situation from
ever arising again.
Meanwhile the road officials, who
have tentatively refused to accept Mr
Wilson's proposal, continued confer
ences among themselves. 1 he labor
leaders, who already have approved
the proposal, marked time awaiting a
definite answer from the employers.
The president's telegram defending
his plan was in reply to an appeal
from George I'ope, president of thr
national association of manufacturers
urging that the principle of arbitra
Hon be preserved in the strike negotl
atiom'.

RENAMING A STEAMER
Bennington Built on Great Lake Now
in Alaska Trade.
R, 11. Mattison. a former Bennington
bov. now secretary of the Seattle,
Wash., Chamber of Commerce, has fur
nished the Banner with a description
of the renaming the steamer Benning
ton, formerly owned by the Rutland
Transit company but now sailing from
Seattle to Alaska ports.
The 8teonier was built at Ecorse.
Mich., eight years ago. She Is now
Owned by the Alaska Steamship 00m-
liany and the name "Valdes" appears
on her bow and pilot house.
The name was changed after permis
sion had been obtained from the do
partmont of commerce at Washington.
The rechristenlng of a vessel is far
from a simple procedure and the
(hanging of the name of the Benning
ton was no exception to the rule.
The government requires that a ves
sel must be free of debt before she can
be rechristencd. The Alaska Steam
ship company made application to the
department of commerce for permis
sion to change the name of the Ben
nington and was Informed that it
would- be necessary to Investigate the
record of the steamer at Buffalo, N.
Y.. her last port of registry. Buffalo
gave the Bennington a clean bill, free
from debt, but while investigating the
reputation of the vesse' it was learned
that she hod been previously register
ed from Detroit, so the whole proced
ure hud to be gone over again In Mich
igan. Finally the Alaska Steamship com
pany received word from Washington
that the Bennington was a vessel of
good reputation at her old home ports,
that she had paid all her debts at Pe
trol! and Buffalo and that the chang
ing of her name would not be in the
nature of the adopt inn of an alias to
hide any Irregularity or crime com
mined either on the Great Lakes or
the Atlantic.

Cardinal Gasparri, papal secretary of
state, in which he said:
"The holy father will watch with a
loving and paternal eye the federa
tion of Catholic hocieties of the United
Status holding their annual conven
tion in New York. He sends earnest
wishes that their frieudly discussions
shall accomplish much for the wel
lare and honor of the Catholic name
In your favored land. And While
hoping for the most consoling results
from your concord, activity and wis
dom, he granted most heartily the
apostolic benediction to the federa
tion and to all who take part in it."
Admission to the cathedral was by
ticket with reservations in the cen
ter aisle for the lay delegates. Ameri
can and papal flags were hung above
the cathedral entrance, with great
streamers of yellow and white, the
papal colors, suspended from each
arch inside. High above all the dec
orations hung the red hat of the late
Cardinal McCloskey. suspended from
the arched ceiling over the chancel.
Three temporary canopied thrones
were erected within the chancel for

Each of the princes of thf church

The lay delegates led the proces
sion into the cathedral and several

while the cardinals, archbishops, bis

and the officers of the mass attended
Cardinal Farley. The cathedral choir
of Pittsburg, numbering 150 male
voices, assisted the high choir of St.

Bishop Thomas F. Hiekey of Ro
chester preached the sermon, taking
for his text: "For this was
and for this came I Into the
that I should give testimony

truth.''
Among the church dignitaries pres

Bennington Man Run Down and
Severe y Bruised at Saratoga
INJURIES NOT ALl SERIOUS
Publicity Writer for New York Con
servation Commissioner Was
Making Moving Pictures.
Warwick S. Carpenter of Benning
ton, publicity writer for the New
York conservation commissioner,
George D. Pratt, Is in a hospital at
Saratoga recovering from injuries re
ceived when he was rundown by an
automobile early Sunday afternoon.
No bones w ere broken but Mr. Carpen
ter has cuts and bruises enough on his
body to keep him in bed for a number
of days. A telephone message receiv
ed this morning from tho hospital
stated that he had a comfortable night
and that there was no occasion for
worry over his condition.
At the time the accident occurred
Mr. Carpenter and two assistants of
Commissioner Pratt were engaged in
taking moving pictures lor the use of
the department Mr Carpenter was
caught in such a manner that ho was
diagged for some distance and when
the automobile, a Maxwell touring car,
was brought to a standstill ho was
doubled under the machine in such a
manner that it was necessary to lift
it from his body. Under the circum
stances it is remarkable that he was
net killed and still more so that he
came through the accident without
broken bones.
Mr. Carpenter was at once hurried
to the hospital and his relatives here
were at once informed of the accident
by telephone. His mother, Mrs. Anna
S, Carpenter and sister, Miss Marcia
Carpenter and driver Frank Rousseau
left here at once for Saratoga whero
they arrived at about 4.30 o'clock.
Mr. Carpenter was found resting as
comfortably as could be expected un
der the circumstances. He was able
to dlscrlhe the accident and jokingly
remarked that he was fortunate
enough not to have been run over by
i Ford.
Mrs. Warwick Carponter and little
son are at Humsrock Beach, Mass.,
and were not informed of the accident
until after it had been learned that no
serious consequences wore likely to
result from It.
