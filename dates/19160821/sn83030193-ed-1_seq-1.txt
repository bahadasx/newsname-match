President, in His
Railroad Chiefs, Declares Wel
fare of All the People Is Involved
in the Present Crisis.
(From a Staff Cerreipandtnt of The Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21. President Wilson this afternoon nude
his strongest appeal to the railroad
ing stand in the way of their accepting the proposition he set before
them looking to bring about a settlement of the railroad crisis.
"I want you to keep In mind,
some things bound up In this situation that are not to be overlooked
at this time particularly the preparedness movement.
The interosts ot this country should appeal to both employer and em
ployees. Dear In inlnd also that there
to us for somothlnc ot human help In tho shape of human necessities. You
who havo not boen here before probably are aware ot my attitude on the
eight-hour day.
"I soe no other way bringing about
a
settlement"
Mr. Wilson then told Louis W. Hill.
K. P. Hlpley and the other now ar
rivals that he wns not to bo under
stood as making a threatening atti
tude in his decisions about tho eight-
hour day, that he long ago reached the
conclusion that It wuh a humane and
progressive movement that had the
approval of society and that besides
these reflections thero wns tho other
that it was the only way leading to
a settlement.
The conference was oallcd unex
pectedly. Not all of tho fourteen
additional railway chiefs summoned
by tho President had arrived, hut as
soon as the President heard Louis .
Hill and K. P. Hlpley wero hero he
sent word that he would llko to seo
all of them this afternoon. Immedi
ately a meeting of the presidents was
called and the Invitation accepted.
"All tho Presidents have not ar
rived yet," said Mr. Underwood of tho
Krle, " and It wns Intended that the
last group summoned on Saturday
should speak for themselves. The
President's reqtiuest changes tho pro
gramme." As tho railroad presidents entered
the White Houso, Hale Holden, their
spokesman, said the executives al
ready here had sought to maintain
open minds on tho entire question,
but that after President Wilson had
explained his plan thoroughly to tho
new nrrlvnls consideration of all ques
tions involved would he begun with
the object of reaching a final decision.
The conference adjourned shortly
after 3 o'clock.
