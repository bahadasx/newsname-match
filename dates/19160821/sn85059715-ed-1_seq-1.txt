WASHINGTON, Aug. 21?President
Wilson towards noon sent word
lo the railway presidents who are
now here asking them to call on him
at the White House at 2:30 o'clock
Monday afternoon. They agreed to
confer with the president but it was
raid they would make no statement |
unless he requested it.
The railroad presidents and their
committee of managers worked
steadily to devise some means of!
averting the threatened strike, which I
would, in the main, accept President [
U'ilson's plan but at the same time ,
preserve the principle o? arbitration. !
They declared they were united
against the president's plan as it |
Btands and hope to agree on some
I form of counter proposal.
The men's meeting decided that
brotherhood members should call on j
senators and representatives from |
their own states and acquaint them i
with the details of the men's side of
the situation. President Carter of j
the engineers was lire only official \
who attended the session.
Some of the incoming railway
president were more optimistic about
the situation than those already
here. One of the western men declared
that if his road alone were involved
he unquestionably would re-j
sist the demands of the men to the I
last but he considers the question a
national one and for that reason was
sure some common ground would be !
found to base a settlement.
