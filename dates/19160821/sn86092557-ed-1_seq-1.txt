Rev. Dr. Mitchell Preaches
Sermon Upon New Com
munity Effort.
At the ovonlng servlco of the ten
tral Christian church yesterday ilev.
Dr. Clarence D. Mitchell, the pastor,
speaking on the subject of "Some Es
sentials in Making Fairmont More
Than 50,000 In Five Years," took a
very optimistic view oi mis task which
tho ^airmont Improvement Associa
tion has set for itself, but he indicated
plainly that success depends upon the
people.
Dr. Mitchell pointed out that Fair
mont lies in the district upon which
Europe must draw largely for the ma
terials used in the reconstruction
which will follow tho war. It is to the
same district, also that the whole
world must turn when tho great for
ward stride which business and build
ing will take everywhere when com
merce and industry return to normal, j
As a transportation center; in climate-1
health conditions, educational facili- j
ties and the other material essentials j
Fairmont Is favored beyond most oth
er citieB in the district, and it is bound
to go ahead of these cities in popula- j
tion and industries?if the people dis-1
play the proper spirit.
The development of the Ohio city I
Lima was cited as an example of what'
may be done when there is the propej
community co-operation. This town I
at the beginniug lacked many of the
i advantages that Fairmont already has, j
but It had an abundance of ambition,
civic pride, a willingness to co operate |
and the capacity to show sincere ap-j
preciation for good work done. The
net result of this happy combination,
Dr. Mitchell said, Is that Lima has be-1
come ono of the most delightful, as j
well as ono of the most important cit-1
ies in tho Buckeye state.
What has been done in one place,
said Dr. Mitchell, can be done in an
other. It can be done here under fa-1
vorable conditions, but it cannot be |
done if the people are grouches; if i
thoy are jealous of one another and
show a disposition to undermine ef-j
forts of others which they do not, for
some trifling reason, approve of.

CARLESTOX, W. Va., Aug. 21.?
West Virginia Republicans go into
the 1916 campaign with ten of the fif
teen state senatorial holdovers. That
is quite an advantage. In the Tenth
and Fifthteenth districts the Demo
crats are sure to gain two more mem
bers of the'upper house. Tho Republi
cans have such wide margins to go
on that they will probably elect a
senator from each of the following dis
tricts: First, Fourth, Sixth, Twelfth
and Fourteeth. They have a chance
also to win in any or all of the follow
ing districts: Second, Third, Fifth,
Seventh and Eighth. Democracy has
a chance to win in the Ninth. Eleventh
and Thirteenth districts, the break3
being even as between the major par
ties.
West Virginia is normally Repub
lican by at least 30,000. Majorities
have been cut down considerably
through past internal differences with
which the party has had to contend,
| but now, according to the wiseacres
and the students of the peculiar brand
of politics indigenous to West Vir
ginia, there is.little to fear from any
inside disarrangements. f
It is an up-hill fight for the Demo
crats to win under any circumstances
in the state, by their own endeavor.
Their whole hope rests in dissension
within the ranks of the opposition,
and that is a condition, with which
the Republicans say they will not con
tend this fall, although it is a fact
that there are some who have voted
the Republican ticket in recent years
who declare they are not with the tick

EAST LIVERPOOL, 0., Aug. 21.?
Residents of East Liverpool are keep
I ing their doors locked?eveu when they
j are inside their own homes &s a result
of the mysteriois sending of threats
and attacks on two women!
Strangers in the city and loungers
are looked upou with suspicion, es
pecially by women, each of whom
fears she may be the next victim of
the mysterious person or persons send
ing letters threatening-violence?-?
A terse warning, scribbled on a
scrap of paper and unsigned,* is
the herajd^of the person who has
terr/ied'the city?a person go far
unknown to the police.
"We'll get you tonight," read a note
received by Mrs. Irma Little. Not
long afterward a man knocked at the
door of her apartment and threw a
phial of acid at Mrs. Little when she
opened i.ic door. She shielded her
face, out her arms were burned.
"We'll get you tonight." read a note
thrust into the home of Mrs. Flor
ence Andersou. An hcur later Mrs.
Anderson was attacked by a man in
j the basement of hor homo.
[ Previously Mrs. Anderson had re
i c.vod a throat and a police guard
J was placed about her house. When
I nothing happened the guard was with
j drawn. The same day the second note
was roceivd and the attack occurred.
Mrs. Little has received three notes
since the attempt to throw acid into
her face. The first read: "I'll get your
pretty face next time." The second
read: rll get you yet," and the third:
"\ou will not smile with your eyes
much longer."
On account of the difference in the
methods of attack on the two women
and the mention of "we" in the notes,
the police believe more than one mtin
is terrorizing the women of the city.
The police are following every clue
and guarding the home o! Mrs. Ander
son. The home of Mrs. Little will be
guarded also when she returns from
Atlantic City, where she fled after re
ceiving the last note.
Mrs. Little is wife of the owner of
a large office building; Mrs. Anderson
s the wife of the secretary of a cloth
ing firm.
Mrs. Little's father, Charles Say
lers, a contractor, says ho believes the
attack on his daughters was meant to
wreck vengeance on him, but he is
unable to assign any reason for such
vengeance.
Saylers has offered a reward of $500
for capture of his daughter's assail

(Bji >Usoclalcd Press.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.?President Wilson toward noon
sent word to the railroad presidents who are now here, asking them I
call on him at the White House at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon.
Th-:y agreed to confer with the President, hut it was said i .
would make no statement unless he requested it. The railroad president!
and their committee of managers worked steadily to devise some n
of averting the threatened strike, which would in the main accept Pn
dent Wilson's plan, but at the same time preserve the principle of a"1*
tration.
They declared they were united against the President's plan ayj|j
stands and hoped to agree on some form of counter proposal.
The men's meeting decided that the brotherhood members should
call on senators and represetnatives from their own states and acquaint
them with details of the men'i side of the situation.
President Carter of the engineers was the only official who att

Some of the incoming railroad presidents were more optin
about the situation than those already here. One of the western l
declared that if his road alone were involved he unquestionably j

a natoinal one and for that reason was sure some common ground would
