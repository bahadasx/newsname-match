LAND COURT ADVISED

Who is the new trustee of the Bish

is Charles King, but Aona, in handling
a land court petition of the Honolulu

has been advised to cite both King
and Williamson as the trustee.
"I certainly am puzzled," says Aona
The Bishop Estate is an interested

JUDGE STUART'S
AHACK FLAHENS
His "Press Bureau" Fails to Get
Consideration for Assault
on Public Officials
BY C. S: ALBERT
(Special 8tr BaIletin Rorressondenee)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 10.
The final passing of Thomas B. Stuart
as a circuit Judge did not lose any
picturesque and mystifying features.
These continued until the last
A week after scheduled time the
resignation of Judge Stuart was
placed in the hands of President Wil
son. It was taken to the White House
by Senator Shafroth and delivered in
person. More than 24 hours later it
leached the department of justice.
Immediate acceptance followed, with
the casual stipulation that it should
be effective upon the qualification of
his successor. This is always inserted
to prevent depletion of the bench by
wholesale resignations. The letter of
Jndfi-a Stuart reauested relief "as
soon as possible."
. It was found that the letter of resig
nation was dated Honolulu,. April 18.
It was but 10 days less than four
months In reaching the president
This doubtless was due to the fre
quent exchanges between the; Judge
and Senator Shalrotn. The date oc
casioned much comment among . off!
clals. ,:
Almost coincident with the resigna
tion came the first publicity given
Judge Stuart's allegations against the
president. Secretary Lane, Attorney
General Gregory, Governor Pinkham
and others. The frantic efforts of the
Judge's press bureau to secure the
general publication of his letter to
the president, utterly failed. Not a
word was used. , But when the Star
Bulletin of July' 18, containing the
complete letter of Judge Stuart,
reached New York It wis boiled down
and published. This was copied and
spread around to a considerable ex
tent. Close on the heels of this came
the real resignation.
In the meantime, President Wilson
made it impossible for any of the offi
cials mentioned In the letter of Judge
Stuart to peruse it at length, t Attor.
ney General Gregory was the first to
request a copy of it. The president
the ntook a pair of shears and whacked,
the letter up into "takes." All those
referring directly to himself went di
rectly Into the waste basket Those
mentioning other were sent to the in
terested parties. The attorney gen
eral received the section belonging to
him. It Is surmised that the take re
lating to Governor Pinkham was sent
along to Hawaii. In no case was there
an explanation desired. The excerpts
were merely for information and be
cause of requests.
Department of. Justice officials be
gan looking for a successor to Judge
Stuart a week before his resignation
came to the White House. As no new
names of eligibles had been' suggested
consideration was confined to the sur
plus recommended for appointment
when several vacancies existed in the
courts of Hawaii. In this way the
mulling process was in tfu swing
when the belated resignation finally
landed In the department of justice.
It is estimated by the census and
statistics office of Canada that the
area devoted to oats for 1916 is 10,
499,500 acres, as compared with It,
r.65,000 acres In 1915 and 10,061,000
acres in 1914. The area sown to bar
ley is estirttated at 1,317,500 acres,
as against "1,509,350 last year. ,

CHOOSE AVIATION
FIELD FOR OAHU
Army officers have selected the site
of the future Oahu aviation camp, and
with the choosing of a suitable field
the organization of the Aero Club of
Hawaii is expected to be undertaken
shortly.
Gen. Robert K. Evans, commanding
the Hawaiian department, is an active
and enthusiastic supporter of the
plans for developing aviation here and
has asked the war department for 24
biplanes and two civilian instructors.
The field chosen Is at Fort Kame
hameha and has many advantages. It
Is easy of access from Honolulu and
has facilities for both land and water
flying. It is on the left of the road
approaching the Fort Kamehameha
buildings. There are approximately
200 acres in the field, and the water
hangar used will be on. the site cho
sen by Lieut. Harold Geier, the
aviator who some time ago made
experiments here ith the Idea of de
veloping service flying in Hawaii. ;
It will be recommended to the war
department that this field be used.
Interest in aviation since Gen.
Evans announced plans has grown
steadily and rapidly. Applications by
would-be aviators are coming in at an
unexpected rate, both from civilians
and army men. Already about a doz
en Schofleld officers have applied.
The National Guard headquarters
here is receiving applications from
guardsmen and civilians.

Preparedness
Parade Plans
Are Brewing
A preparedness parade for
- Honolulu, either within the next
three weeks or some time in the
: fall after the territorial elec-
tions. is being talked over and.
while no definite plans have
been set, will probably crystal-
ize in the next few days.
Army officers are much Inter-
eted in the plans and the sug- -
gestion has been made that Ha-
walla n Department commands
would participate largely in the
parade. It is hoped to have an.
aviation exhibit as well, to stim- 4-
ulate interest in this branch of
the service. If possible the pa-
rade will oe held on a holidav
f and an effort will be made to
f nave a big showing of the Na-
tional Guard as well as of the
regulars, and civic organizations
will be asked to participate. The -f.
- talk has not developed sufficient-
ly far as yet to single out either
a leader in the preparations or -f
any tentative scheme for the pro-
cession, but those Interested are
hoping that the suggestion of
such a parade will develop dls-
i-t- cussion as to the date and defi-
nite backing.
