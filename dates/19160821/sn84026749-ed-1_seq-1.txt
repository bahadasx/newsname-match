important, so far as the allies are
concerned.

CONTINUATION NOT ENOUGH
No New Buildings or Additions
Could Btf. Ereoted on Last
Year's Budget.
Demoralization of the public school
aysteni. here'. If. the' District appropria
tion bill fails to pass, is predicted In a
communication to Senator John Walter
Smith from the 'High School Teachers'
Union.
The letter to Senator Smith, who Is
one of the conferees on the Dlstrlot ap
propriation bill, la signed by Roy C.
Claflln, president of the teacher's union.
It refers to reports that the District
bill may all In conference, and says
that civic progress In tho District would
be at a standstill for a year should this
occur.
No New Work.
The letter continues:
"While a continuation appropriation
would enable the wheels of the local
government to keep moving on the pres
ent schedule. It would not permit of
the commencement of any new con
struction work such as paving of streets,
erection of new school and other public
buildings, bridges, etc., or any special
work.
"Moreover, the failure to enact the
District appropriation bill would pre
vent the opening of the new Central
High School. :"the Park View School,
the Dunbar' (chool and other schools
scheduled for opening In September.
These schools represent a large outlay
of public money and their use is an
Immediate necessity.
Wonld Cripple System.
"In other ways the educational sys
tem would be seriously orlppled The
additional teachers provided for In the
bill, which are needed to accommodate
the Increase in the number of students,
and thus preserve the efficiency of tho
school. systom, would be disallowed.
The construction of the proposed new
Eastern, High Bchool would be delayed
for another year, as would other much
needed new 'schools and additions to
present ones.
"The District government throughout
all ' Its branches would be seriously
handicapped. Jinny necessary reforms
aad Improvements In the Health, the
Police and the Fire Departments would
be frustrated for this year. The play
grounds and bathing beach are nlieady
suffering the effects of tho delay In
the passage of the appropriation meas
ure. Usefulness Curtailed.
"Their usefulness to the public has
been seriously curtailed because It Is
not possible to pay assistants In the
work anything but an insignificant
amount, and It Is unlawful to accept
services gratis.
"There could be no salary Increases
for the comng fiscal year. There are
provisions for pome very proper and
just salary Increases which should take
effect without further delay. '
"It Is Inconceivable that Congress,
ma4e up mostly of statesmen
and business men, would be so un
businesslike and shortsighted as to al
low a disagreement In a few particu
lars to prevent the passage of a rea
sonably good appropriation bill, result
ing as it would In a most unsatisfac
tory condition of affairs In a municipal
government over which Congress ltnelf
has supreme jurisdiction. The reflec
tion of Congress would be shameful,
and the responsibility would rest chief
ly upon those who are intrusted with
the guiding of District legislation.
Doesn't Satisfy House.
"If the half-and-half plan, the Chief
bone of contention, does not satisfy the
House of Representatives, they should
nevertheless pass the present appro
priation bill under that plan and then
set about to devise a substitute system
for future appropriations which will
carry with it the assurance of per
manent fairness to the District as well
as to the nation.
"It Is to lbs hoped that the District
appropriations bill will be passed in a
very short time, as each day of delay
Is a detriment to the District.
"The District conferees are still In
deadlock over the appropriation bill
and there Is as yet no evidence that
the House or Senate wilt recede from
its position."

MUMION BILL
Smith of Carolina Brings Meas
ure to.Front in Spite of Op
position. Just when Senate leaders thought
they had the Immigration bill side
tracked for the session it was forced
to the front today by Senator Smith
of South Carolina.
Ho moved to proM( with consider
atlon of the Immlsstloci bill and by i
vote of 27 to 34 the motion carried.
Senate leaders havo been seeking
to put the Immigration bill over to
the next session because they have
feared that If tho President should
again veto the bill, which Is strongly
invorea Dy organizea laoor, ll would
hurt him In the campaign.
Nino Democratic Senators and eight
een Republicans voted to take up the
bill. Tho nlno Democrats were Ashurst,
Beckham, Culbertson, Hardwlck, Lane,
Myers. Overmnn. Smith of South Caro
lina, ana varuaman.
The Immigration bill contains the
literacy text feature. The President. It
Is generally understood, will veto It If
It is sent to him. Some of the sup
porters of tho bill In tho Senate profess
to believe the President will not ven
ture to veto it If It laid before him,
but there is no official confirmation of
this opinion.
Whether the taking up of the bill will
delay adjournment Is not clear, but it
probably will not.
The Senate took an unusual step when
It went into execuUve session to con
sider legislation.
Senator O'Qorman of New' York
moved an executive session to consider
that part of the immigration bill which
had reference to the Japanese.
Senator Smith of Georgia seconded
the k motion. The motion prevailed,
and the doors were closed and the
galleries cleared. Ordinarily, matters
of legislation nre considered In the
open, and tho attempt nt secrecy Is
observed only with reference to
treaties and nominations.

ONE RAIDER IS WOUNDED
Colored Sold'irs Commended
for Their Work In Prevent
ing Attack.
EL PASO, Aug. 21. Colored
troops of the District of Columbia
national 'guard, stationed at Naco,
Ariz., had their first clash with
Mexicans since coming to the bor
der early yesterday.
Incidentally they prevented a
raid upon an American ranch.
Investigation today shows that
the right was not with troops of the
Carranza government, but with a
band of Mexican bandits, bent upon
stealing horses in Arizona.
The Mexicans, about twenty in
number, attempted to slip across
the line near Naco, and when a
sentry gave the command to halt,
one of them fired.
The sentry replied and the alarm
called re-enforcements from the
camp.
LIVELY FIGHT.
There was a lively exchange of shots
for a few minutes, and the Mexicans re
treated. , Nono of tbe District of Columbia
guardsmen wsri' Injured, but when quiet
was restored one of the Mexicans,
wounded, was found on the American
side of the line.
The Mexican confessed that ha belong
ed to a party of bandits bent upon rob
bery in the United States, and said they
had In mind a raid on a nearby ranch.
Carransa officials today denied all re
sponsibility for the raid, although ex
pressing regrets at the affair, and asked
for the return of the wounded nrlsoner
to them for trial, asserting that an ex
ample would be made of him.
The promptness of the colored guards
men In discovering the attempt and In
repelling It brought forth commendation
from the District commander. General
Davis, at Douglas today.
SHOTS OVER BORDER

Member of First Maryland Said to
Have Been Fired On.
' EAGLE PASS, ' Aug. 1L General
Greene has asked for a thorough In
vestigation of reports that a member of
Company K, First Maryland Regiment,
was fired upon yesterday from the Mexi
can side of the Rio Grande while doing

The detachment at the bridge was com
manded by Lieut E. Brooke Lee, of
Sliver Spring, son of United States Sen
ator Lee.
Several shots were fired, and. though

BUSINESS MEN SEND VIEWS
White House Flooded With
Pleas From Shippers to
Avert Threatened Tie-up.
The President will meet all
the railroad presidents at the
White House at 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon.
Determined to head off any ar
bitration legislation that might be
under consideration, leaders among
the brotherhoods, representing the
ra'lway employes, descended on
Congress today in force.
President Wilson's statement in
his telegram to George Pope, pres
ident of the National Association
of Manufacturers, that "thiaitna
tion must never be alfoweti to arife
again," has caused some of the
leaders to feel he may have some
sort of compulsory arbitration
step in mind.
After talking with various Con
gressmen from their home districts,
the leaders said they were assured
n compulsory arbitration legisla
tion would be attempted at this
time.
WILSON'S ANSWER READY.
Big railroad men of the West, hurry
ing Into Washington today with the
single demand of "arbitration" on their
, lips, found President
Wilson's answer
i waiting thorn.
t, ,. tha,
hnlll. ,,. '
acceptance of the eight-
hour day now and appointment of a
commission to Investigate all the arbi
tration points Involved is the surest
means toward bringing about perma
nent, workable arbitration for the fu
ture. in the moantime business men of the
country are Hooding the White House
and Congress with appeals to prevent
by any means a tie-up of the railroads.
Louis W. Hill, head of the Great
Northern, arrived at 9:20 a. m. He re.
eclved a hearty greeting from other
presidents and railway men In the
lobby of the Wlllard Hotel. He declined
to talk about the strike at all until ho
hud had time to go over the situation
with other executives.

Henry C. Wheeler, chairman of the
United States Chamber of Commerce
committee, which was active In ef
forts to avert a strUce In early stages
of the negotiations, also arrived, Mr.
Wheeler said he was not here In con
nection with the executives' meeting,
but came solely on unamoer or vom
merce business.
Men Meet at Dijou.
The brotherhood delegates had a
meeting at the Bijou at 10 o'clock
this morning, but adjourned without
transacting business, subjeot to call
of their leaders.
Labor leaders among the delegates,
powerful politically In their home
communities, then turned their atten.
tlon at once to Congress.
The brotherhood chiefs were puzzled
by President Wilson's statement In
his telegram to Mr, Pope that owing
to the lack of means by which arbi
tration can bo enforced, causing the
present emergency, "some means must
be found to prevent Its recurrence,"
The President added that "this situa
tion must never be allowed to arise
again."
Some leaders of tho men saw In this
a voiled suggestion that the Presi
dent might favor some means of com
pulsory arbitration, though none of
them knew what tho President had In
mind,
Leaders were agree dthat there isn l
r, ohanco for compulsory arblltratloa
eglslatton at this time. They have
sufficient assurances from Congres-
