YOUNG PEOPLE ORGANIZE TO
PROMOTE CHRISTIAN UNITY j
Pendleton religious workers,
nl the younger element, are to
meet this evening at the l'res-
bytertan church for the initiu-
tion of a movement that may in .
lime prove far-reaching The
idea in lew calls Tor the joint
organisation of ail the young
peoples religious societies into
one body and eventually the
cut of busin
gear.
Those in the party
and Mrs. Itoy Alexander, Fred Hloch,
Curl Perlnger and Marshall Spell. The
patty was enroute to Hingham and
they did not leave Pendleton until
after 10 o'clock, so it was quite dark
at the time of the trouble. The car
had just rounded the bend on the
Halt pin curve when Hoy Alexander,
who was driving and had gone down
the hill on intermediate, discovered
the car was out of gear. He applied
the foot brake and when it failed to
respond ihrew on the emergency
brake, which hud also been rendered
Life less by the accident.
Meanwhile the car had gained mo
mentum and was going at terrific
speed down the hill. Mr. Alexander
succeeded in holding the car In the
road until within 15(1 feet from the
foot of the grade. There he ran Into
a small log on the left side of the road
and the log brought the car to a stop
without damage. The people in the j
cur were entirely unhurt.
At the beginning of the dash down i
hill Fred Bloch Jumped from the rear j
seat and landed without harm other
than some bruises. A moment later j
Carl Perlnger jumped from the car
und in falling struck his head on a
rock in such manner that he was
stunned fur a time, though not seri
ously hurt.
The car itself was not damaged and
was brought in last evening under its
ow n power. Had the car continued its
rourse to the foot of the hill it would j
have struck a tree at the bottom of
fhe grade and a disasterous accident
would have been certain.
The members of the party were res
cued by N'esmlth Ankeney who had
preceded them and driven back from
Hingham when news of the accident
reached the resort over the phone.

HEADS FOR SHORT CONFERENCE,
BROTHERHOOD STAND IS FIRM
In their drive against the Germans,
the Hritish have discovered some
things they did not know about war,
and this gun is one of them. It is
a mortar used to throw bombs into
Hritish trenches. The gun, as is evl-
lent from the picture, moves on a
track through an arc of about 60
degrees, and in that range it can
throw deadly hombs Into the British
trenches It had been used against
the men w ho took it for a long time.

WHEAT HITS HIGH
MARK OF SEASON
NEWS SUMMARY
With dealers offering from $1.10 to
11-12 for club today, wheat has reach
ed the highest figure of the season.
The bearish reports of the many fail
ures throughout the country has
boomed the price. Farmers are re
luctant to sell with the rising market
and are of the opinion that the price
will go even mu-h higher.
It is reported that several small lots
sold at 11.10 Saturday although the
selling was not heavy. One man sold
two crops which he has been holding
and has yet his 1916 crop to sell. Prac
tically no wheat has been purchased by
local dealers today.
With such high prices prevailing
while the farmers still have their
wheat, there will be more money turn,
ed loose in the county than for many
years, according to bankers. Gener
ally, when the strong prices are bein4
offered, most of the farmers have
nothing t sell.
