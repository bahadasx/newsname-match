United Press Special Correspondent.
LONDON, Sep- 12. The Bulgarian
right wing has been rolled back under
heavyi Anglo-French attacks In tha
first big pitched battle since the Al
lies began their offensive In the Bal
kans.
The Frencn war office this after
noon announced the capture of Bul
garian trenches on a two-mile frnt
to a depth of two mils? !n the region
north of Sajad&n. An official state
ment from SalonikI tells ol the cap
ture of Yenlmah by the French and
British.
Allies Begin Drive.
Press dispatches from Athens left
lHtle doubt that the great northward
drive of the Allies from SalonikI has
begun. After thirty-six hours of heavy
fighting the Bulgars are retreating,
with the Allies in pursuit, Athens re
imrted. Unconfirmed reports claim the Bul
garians are also retreating from
Macedonia and have evacuated the
forest of Kavala. Serbians, Al
banians, French and British troops
are now attacking the German-Bulgarian
forces in Greece, with Italians
and Russians ready to join the offen
sie. The Bi'lgai:ans attempted to stem
the Serbian advance southwest of As
troro by a counter-attack but were
checked and 'thrown 'backT suffering
severly. While the Bulgarian wings
are being pressed back, French ar
tillery has opened a big artillery duel
in the center.
Germans Are Silent.
The Bulgarian and German war of
fices thus far have made little com
ment on the new Allied offensive- The
German official statement reported
heavy fighting along the Struma but
declared the Bulgarians had been suc
cessful.
On the southeastern Rumanian
frontier and on the southwest and
east battlefronts no events of great
Importance have occurred in the past
twentfour hours. The Turkish war
office made known the presence of
Turkish troops with the German-Bulgarian
armies Invading. Rumania, and
the German office claims further
progress for the invaders.
The loss of the village of GInchy to
the British in the Somme operations
was admitted officially at Berlin this
afternoon. The French claimed the
capture o'f more German trenches
south of the Somme and the repulse
of German attacks.

TO RESTORE MEXICO
Joint Commision Discusses
Plans for Using American
Methods.
BY CARL D. GROAT
(United Press Surf Correspondent)
NEW LONDON. Conn.. Sep. 12.
American farmers to till Mexican soli
and American teachers to train Mexi
can minds, that was the plan before
the American-Mexican commission to
day. Such a program was Intended
to be a part of Mexico's contemplated
rejuvenation. The commission agreed
that It would be feasible.
As formulated thus far the scheme
Is to have only such numbers of
Americans 'as will set an example
for the Mexicans, and there is every
Intention to avoid anything that
smacks of American Interference or
control.
The Mexicans presented supple
mentary data today to show there Is
an honest effort to make the rich
country below the Rio Grande bloom
again after six years of civil strife.
They told the American commis
sioners that while crops In some parts
of Mexico have suffered from a lack
of labor, other portions showed a re
markable productlveness-
The essential underlying economic
problems will be thoroughly probed
before the question of withdrawing
American troops is determined defi
nitely. Both sides agree that work
must be provided and that the unedu
cated must be taught before Mexico
can have an asurance of continued
progress.
President Wilson's presence In New
London, six miles from where the
commission is meeting, had no effect
on the meeting. The American groun
explained that their visit there last
night waa solely to pay their condol
ences'and not to talk Mexican matters.

more than 18,000 votes, and the Demo
crats won by about 3,000. The dif
ference is about 15,000. There were
but a few scattered (precincts to be
heard from today, and the Republican
claim of 15,000 would practically be
the total of their majority. '
In other words, they claimed that
practically 100 per cent of the Bull
Moosers returned to the old party.
The Republican victory was made
impressive In the fact that their fight
on the Democratic defenses was
waged exclusively on national Issues.

majority attained by the Republican
gubernatorial nominee, Carl E. Mil-,
