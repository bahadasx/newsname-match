WEBSTEX CITY

ESTABLISHED IN 1857.
CENSUS OF IOWA JUST
MD BY THE STATE
+, Satisfactory Results are Shown.—
The Commonwealth Has En
joyed Steady Growth.
1
That Iowa has not, in any decade,
or in any 5-year period, suffered a
real loss of population, as a whole, id
of the conclusions that must be
•drawn from the latest edition of the
-census of Iowa, just issued by the
state. Not until the facts regard
ing the 1916 census were available
..^and the comparisons were made with
(previous enumerations, could this be
inferred* When the latest state
'count is compared with those of each
decade of the past it is found that
H'-the state has shown a steady increase
x«f population, not as great as in the
|ipasjt, but still an increase. The flu
Actuations which this comparison
shows cannot be accounted for by
any condition in the state. While
v. jr:
Sphere has been for a number of years
a decline in the rural population
there has been an increase in the ur
ban population to more than offset
it all. So the conclusion is forced
that the trouble was with the enum
^jerations. It would seem certain that
one enumeration was padded, in s^ne
of the cities, and the other was'de
ficient. This demonstration, now
fqr the first time made, will end the
pessimism about the "decline of pop
ulation" in Iowa, as a whole. The
loss of rural population is something
common to many states and is the
natural result of changing social
conditions.
There are on an average 42.4 per
sons to the square mile of land area
in Iowa, or 19.4 per square mile of
rural population only. The present
rural population of the state is 1,
080,116,. as against 1,142,114 ten
years ago. The urban population
is 1,277,950, an increase of 210,014
in the decade. The rural popula
tion now is 45.8 per cent of the
whole population, though ten years
ago it was 51.2 per cent.
The number of males in the state
is 1,212,^§8 and the number of fe
males 1,145,078
The voters number 684,939. This
is all males of voting age who are
naturalized. The number of males
of militia age is 509,421.
Iowa is pre-eminently a state of
natives. There are in the state 2,
093,897 persons who were born un
der the American flag, and of these
1,551,914 were born in Iowa.
USE GASOLINE
AT ANY PRICE
More Gasoline Used This Year in
This City Than During Last
Year Here.
In spite of the high price of gaso
line this year, according to one auto
mobile man, there has been a larger
quantity used than ever before. The
increasing number of automobiles is
one of the reasons why this is true,
and also the greater distances now
thought possible to travel than for
merly were undertaken.
Nowadays, with the roads in fair
condition, no one thinks anything
of a little run out to the Yellowstone
park, or to the Qrand Canyon of Col
orado. They fill-the car with rela
tives and go back home in Ohio or
Indiana for a week's visit and the
residents of California run back to
South Carolina or New York for a
few weeks. They must fill the gaso
line tanks enroute, and that is why
more gasoline is being used. Last
year was one of heavy rains all over
the United States and consequently
less auto traffic than this year, when
for a period of almost two months,
there have been no heavy rains
throughout the middle west to spoil
the roads for cross country driving.
Last year there were 23,000 gal
lons of gasoline sold at this parti
cular garage mentioned, at an aver
age of 14 cents per gallon. This
year so far there have been sold 21,
000 gallons at an average price of
22 cents per gallon. There are three
months yet to be counted, besity' the
remainder of September, and the
number of gallons will be consider
ably above last year's amount

Miss Mabel Huddlestun Suffers
Very Painful Injury on Sat
urday Night.
On Saturday night, as Miss Mabel
Huddlestun was preparing to re
tire, she stepped quickly frjm the bed
to the rug landing-squarely upon
needle and running it into the foot
between two toes, breaking it short
off in the foot. Although the in
jury was very painful It was thought
the needle could be extracted easily
the next morning. When morning
came, however, the offender could not
be located and it was necessary to
take an x-ray picture of the foot be
fore the bit of steel could be found
When it was located, and the pa
tient anesthetized, a deep incision
was necessary before the needle
could be extracted. It was during
this that the young sister, Ramona
Huddlestun, proved herself the hero
ine, holding her sister's foot and
otherwise making herself useful with
commendable grit.

What Other Towns are Doing in That
I
Direction.—Views of Physi-,
cal Culture.
There has been some street criti
cism of the park commission for the
Bwimming pool in Nokomis park and
it has been charged that the estab
lishment of a pool "there was'unneces
sary, insomuch as we have a river
where bathing and swimming may be
indulged in.
It is true that we have a river,
but swimmers themselves can tell
just how many weeks of the year the
current is fit for young boys, worn
en or girls, to bathe in. A swimming
pool with water flowing through it
of uniform depth, is the only solu
tion for a safe bathing place in
time of drought or in high water
seasons. The Physical Culture maga
zine for September, has a most per
tinent article upon inland bathing
pools or beaches, a portion of which
Is good enough to reprint:
Few forms of exercise combine so
many advantages for lungs or mus
cles as bathing in the open air on a
clean sandy beach in a large volume
of water. Until quite recently the
bathing beach was looked upon as
the exclusive privilege of the inhab
itants of sea-cost cities or those fav
orably located on the Great Lakes
Physical Culture believes that every
city in the country, whether large or
small, should have its bathing beach,
that such a beach would be found to
be a business asset of the city.
"Four years ago Denver began the
construction of a bathing beach and
bath house at Washington park. A
public bath house, built at a total
cost of eighty-seven thousand dol
lars, a year or two before, had given
the public a taste of the bather's joy.
This proved to be an Immediate sue
cess and haB an average daily atten
dance of one thousand at present.
An outdoor pool and bath house at
Lincoln park had been built for the
children in a poor section of the
city at a total cost of four thousand
four hundred and ninety dollars.
These successes were so pronounc
ed that Mayor Robert W. Speer who
had Inaugurated the movement, de
cided in 1911 upon the creation of
real bathing beaches.
Berkeley park beach at the western
limit of the city, was built In 1913
at a cost of eight thousand, two hun
dred and fifty dollars. This summer
a boys' beach was started at Cooper
lake, where a playground attendant
acts as guaVd, and has charge of a
tent where the boys change their
clothes.
Then Denver municipal bathing
beaches stand as an object lesson to
every inland city in America. With
out any natural advantages, at a .rid
iculously low cost, Denver has creat
ed self-sustaining municipal beaches,
the success of which is at*jsted by
one glance at the bronzeU and hap
py throngs that over run them.

Sunday Afternoon Boozer is Chief
Actor in Low Class Comedy
'Drama.
1
:v
«. v. re
Seneca street was the scene of a
low class play Sunday afternoon
which started out to be a thrilling
drama but ended in a partial come
dy. One H. L. Acord was the star
actor and used up a lot of energy on
an innocent glass window in an old
building between Division and First
streets.
You see, Acord had just enough of
the stuff which stimulates to make
him as proud as Lucifer and as strong
as Sandow. Therefore when one
small boy taunted him by calling at
tention to his intoxicated condition,
Acord was perfectly able to resent
such an insult. For some reason,
however, this stuff which stimulates
does not make one quick of wit or
movement, so when Acord's strong
right arm shot out to avenge the in
sult, it encountered no small boy but
Instead went right through a per
fectly good pane of glass. It was
too bad the glass was good, with
not a crack in it and might have
done duty for several years. It will
cost several dollars to replace it and
all the residents on Seneca street are
sorry about that pane of glass.
As for the arm, Acord took it to
physician who found it necessary
to make several stitches and it will
be some time before it fa used to
avenge another insult. The next
time however, this Acord, whose
name should have been Discord, for
the sorry part of the story is that
he does not seem to be in Acord with
his fellow men, will take care that
no panes of glass are in the vicinity
when he exercises his right arm
Acord said he was an employe of
the shoe factory, which denies the
accusation. Later he was said to
have been an employe of Chas. Mil
ler in thel transfer service and Mr.
Miller alsA denies the allegation.
There was, however, such a man and
he thrust his fist through a pane of
glass on Seneca street.
Later.—Since the above was writ
ten and put into type, we find some
of the particulars are wrong. Infor
mation from Justice Tucker's office
reveals the fact that it WM no small
boy at whom Acord struck, but a
young man about 18 years of age—
Ray^ Reese—who this morning swore
out information charging Acord
with assault and battery. He testi
fies that Acord knocked him down
twice before he dodged him and the
angered man thrust his hand through
the window. Acord was missing this
morning and is thought to have
skipped—gone to Des Moines, where
he has friends.

SEIFERT AGAIN THE COACH.
A Light, Inexperienced Team Faces
Heavy Schedule of Eight
Games.
With the opening of high school
this last week, the football athletes
began preparation for the approach
ing season. Active practice was re
sumed on Wednesday afternoon, and
a squad of twenty-one showed up on
the field for the opening work-out
A-number of others have come out
since then.
Coach E. R. Sifert, whose success
as athletic director last year is still
fresh In the memory of all Webster
City "fans," will have charge of the
boys again this year. In addition,
the squa/.' will have the benefit of
the ser\l ts of Mr. Albert Nelson, the
new instructor in commercial bran
ches at the high school. Mr. Nelson
was formerly assistant coach at
Garlham, and is thoroughly acquaint
ed both with the science and the
practice of the game. He will have
charge of the reserve squad.
The schedule is exceptionally
heavy, and an even break in victories
is the most hoped for by the most
optimistic. The opening games are
with Fort Dodge and Ida 3rove, both
of Which were undefeated claimants
last year of the state title. Roth
teams have their line-up practically
intact. The schedule includes, in ad
dition, such teams as Perry, Algona,
Storm Lake, Clarion, Eldora and
Humboldt.
The Webster City prospects are
only fair. Of last year's veterans,
France, Gilmore, Simpson, Green
wood, Sparboe, and Tatham were lost
by graduation. Britson, of whom
much waB expected at center, is still
with the troops on the Mexican bor
der, and Spratt, who bade fair to
prove himself the speediest half
back In northern Iowa, is farming in
North Dakota. Only Lane at quar
ter and Froning at guard remain to
form a nucleus for the eleven of
1916.
Of last year's Becond team, Thomp
son, DeFrance, Ward, Mason, Staf
ford, Richardson and McConnell
have reported thus far, and in addi
tion there is other promising mater
ial on the field. Many of the new
comers as well as the last year's re
serves, are light, and this, with their

SIXTH ANNUAL
FARMER'S PICNIC
Duncombe To Hav& Big Time on
Saturday, Sept. 16.—Lieut.
Gov. Harding to Speak.
Duncombe will hold her Bixth an
nual farmer's picnic on next Satur
day, Sept. 16th. There will be a gun
shoot, ball games, basket dinner,
street exhibition, etc. Lieut. Gov.
W. L. Harding will speak in the city
park at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
Two base ball games will be played,
the first between the Snell and Ost
lund threshing crews at 10 in the
morning, and the other in the after
noon at 3 o'clock, the Lehigh team
vs. the Duncombe club. The Lehigh
band will furnish music during the
day. A dance will be given at the
opera house in the evening. Our
Duncombe friends are promising a big
time to all who attend.
The American Express Company,
which was last week looking for a
new location, failed to find a suitable
one and has rented the Mickelson
building on Des Moines street for
another year. A few minor improve
ments will be made on the building,
but the owner will not install a new
front or make any great improve
ment, the matter of improvements
and raising the rental having been
compromised upon this basis.
inexperience is bound to tell against
them.
The schedule follows:
Sept. 30—Fort Dodge at Fort
Dodge.
Oct. 7—Ida Grove at Ida Grove.
Oct. 14—No game scheduled.
Oct. 21—Humboldt at Humboldt.
Oct. 28—Storm Lake at Webster
City.
Nov. 7—Algona at Algona.
Nov. 11—Clarion at Clarion.
Nov. 18—Eldora at Webster City.
Nov.30— (Thanksgiving)— Perry
at Webster City.
The three hame games are classed
as the best on the schedule. Eldora
high school has never been met be
fore by a Webster City team, but
their eleven last year won every
game on the schedule. Storm Lake
has never been defeated by a local
team, and Perry last year played as
strong a game as any eleven met by
Webster City, the final score being
27 to 14 in favor of Webster City.
The opening game, with Fort Dodge,
will doubtless attract many local
fans to that city to root for the vis
itors, although no hopes are enter
tained of anything but the possi
bility of a low score for Fort Dodge.
By the time the home season opens,
on Oct. 28, the team will have ac
quired some of the much-needed ex
perience, and the boys will doubt
less put up their "old-time" peppery
gridiron exhibition.
EVANGELISTIC
MEEK OPENED
Dr. Brown Greeted With Large Aud
ience at Christian Church
in Spite of Rain.
A large audience came out through
the rain Sunday night to hear Dr.
Bruce Brown at the Christian church
on the subject, "The Enlargement or
Life." In his opening remarks, Dr.
Brown spoke of the time when, as a
young man, he came to Webster City
as pastor and how loyally the church
stood by him in those days. Mr.
Brown has a commanding pulpit
presence and makes his appeal to the
intellect as well as the heart. The
speaker said there are so many
things about which we differ that
we had better stay near the things
upon which we are agreed. The un
known quantity in the equation is
too large, but all agree that Chris
tianity enlarges life. It sanctifies
the cradle exalts woman redeems
man. He made an eloquent plea for
the big things in life. There should
be no room for littleness.

Juniors of City Celebrate First An

Parsonage.
Over three hundred children of the
city gathered Friday night at the
home of Rev. J.O. Staples on Division
street to celebrate the first birth
day of the Juniors. The Junior so
ciety is.one which met every Sunday
of the past year at the Baptist
church at 3 o'clock in the afternoon
to sing and to hear a short story
from the Bible. Mr. and Mrs. George
Steep are the ones who have carried
on this work which has been so com
mendable. Children from all
churches, or no church at all, are
always cordially invited to attend
and to join the society and have
rather generally accepted the invi
tation as the party last evening gives
evidence.

SECURE INTEREST
ING DATA ON LAW
State Authorities Lax on Old LaWi^
but Spruced up on New Rul
ing Last Week.
It appears that some of the sports
men who were detained Sept. 1st,
in the vicinity of the northern lakes
for shooting wild ducks and other
migratory birds, have been zealous
ly digging for data upon the subject
of law.
So many of them felt the thunder
bolt of law descend upon their de
fenseless heads with all the majesty
of power, that they are still feeling
the effects of the shock. It seems
that for the past few years the open
season for migratory birds has been
from Sept. 1st to Dec. 15th, but for
some reason the agricultural depart
ment, which has power to make rul
ings for open and closed season, this
year, about ten days before the time
for the open season changed the rul
ing to Sept. 16th.
Instances are cited where the for-,
mer laws were not enforced, but up
on this later ruling great care was
taken to nab all unsuspecting hunts
men on Sept. 1st. The public has
surely not been given proper warn
ing or notice regarding the change.
A case is now before the supreme
court, having been brought up from
Arkansas, and a decision will he
rendered next month.
Information from reliable sources
gives the assurance that every win
ter wild ducks are shot by the mil
lions in the southern states without
any attempt made to restrict the
slaughter. The real conservation
the government is talking about
seems to take place only in tbe mid
dle west, where the opportunities to
kill Wild dncHS teaftt In th«
United States.
The sportsmen wbo left this city
Aiig. 31st to shoot at Wall Lake were
not anxious to disobey the law, if
they had been they mig|it have gone
few days before and indulged In
little known law breaking, unHer
guise of coming early to avoid the
rush, or something of the kind. As
it was, they left this city to be on
the spot on the first day the law pro
vided for open season, and with this
understanding procured their hunt
ters' licenses.
The G. S. Dunlap family will soon
return to Sioux City, their former
home. Their daughter, Miss Helen
Dunlap, left Sunday forenoon for
Sioux City where she will enter high
school today, making her home with
an aunt until her parentB arrival the
first of October.
