day with what on the face of returns
from ninety-three percent of her vot

THE MAINE ELECTION
Difference of Opinion by National
Chairmen as to Whether Pro
gressives Have All
Returned.
[United Press Leased Wire Service]
N©W YCHRJK, Sept 12^-Republl
cans are confident and gratified anil
democrats are encouraged and satis
fled with the results of the Maine
elections of yesterday, according to
statements of the leaders of both
parties today. While the* republicans'
claimed the elections indicate a com
plete reunion of the republican and
progressive parties, the democrats
maintained that later figures will
show that a large percentage of the
progressives voted the democratic
ticket
Chairman Wilcox of the republican
national committee In commenting
on the elections said:
"I regard the Maine results an in
dication of the certain eleotlon of
Hughes and Fairbanks In November.
The election has proven we area re
united party. That means success in
the campaign. The administration
turned loose Its cabinet members and
best speakers In Maine and made a
fight for the support of the adminis
tration and this vote Is and will be
determined t»y the people of the
country as Maine's verdict on the
administration. I was with Mr.
Hughes for an hour last night and
he feels very much gratified over the
results in Maine."
Chairman McCormick, of the demo
cratic national commfttee, smiled
and told the newspaper men he had
"no sad song to sing."
McCormick said "a plurality of ap
proximately of only 10,000 In com
parison with the republican plurali
ties in Maine in past years indicates
that this Is a democratic year and
that President Wilson will be re
elected. I think that this is particu
larly significant when It Is realize^
that President Wilson is stronger b»
far than the local ticket In Maine,
according to advices which come tc.
me.
"I most certainly do not concede a
general return of progressives to the
republican party. I have not yet had
time to analyze all the figures, but
reports tell me that the democratic
party got a goodly percentage of the
progressive votes and I am positive
that we will get at least twenty-five
per cent of the progressives In the
presidential elections. You must re
member this was a local election.
President Wilson's name was not on
the ballot and I am sure that If it
had been, the democratic party would
have polled 10,000 more votes."

president has asked that they be con

His reason for this is that if he goes
on an extended trip into the west he
will be compelled to deliver numerous
platform speeches—all of a political
nature, and he wishes to avoid this,
believing that the president of the
United States should not campaign for
re-election.
Cummlngs urged the president to
make one speech in Connecticut and_
believes he may acquiesce. The

SIX YEARS OF STRIFE
American-Mexican Peace Commission
„„Talks Over the.-Plana Which
Will Regenerate the
Country.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 12.—
American farmers to till Mexican soil
and American teachers to train Mexi
can minds—that was a plan before the
American-Mexican peace commission
today.
Such a program was Intended to be
part of Mexico's contemplated regen
eration. The commission agreed that
it would be feasible.
As formulated thus far, the scheme
Is only to have such numbers of
Americans as will set an example for
the Mexicans, and there is every In
tention to avoid anything that'smacks
of American interference or control.
The Mexicans presented data today,
supplementing yesterday's, on rail
roads, to show that there is an hon
est effort to make the rich country
below the Rio Grande blossom anew
after six years of civil strife. They
told the American commissioners that
while the crops In some parts of
Mexico have suffered from lack of
labor, other portions show a remarka
ble productiveness.
These essentialg underlying econom
ic problems will be.thoroughly probed
before the question of withdrawing
American troops is determined defi
nitely. Both sides agree that work
must be proidved and that the unedu
cated must be taught before Mexico
can have any asurance of continued
progress.
President Wilson's presence in
New London, six miles from the Gris
wold hotel, commission headquarters,
had no effect upon the meetings. The
American group explained that their
visit there last night was strictly to
pay their condolences and not to talk
Mexican matters.
Secretary of the Interior Lane and
his conferees hoped to be able to re
port to the president within the next
few days a definite plan on the con
templated withdrawal of American
forces from Mexico and restriction of
border patrol with fewer men than at
present

LONDON, Sept. 12.—The Bulgarian

first big pitched battle since the al

Balkans.
The French war office Chis after

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press

BERLIN, Sept 12-—The German
peo'ple are becoming more and more
dissatisfied with the new government
food department. The optimistic state
ments of Herr Von Batockl, the new
"food dictator" about the food out
look led the people to believe that by
fall conditions would be greatly im
proved. But Instead of becoming
more plentiful, food supplies are be
coming more and more organized,
until within a short time, if the rils
tributlon of cards is continued, food
will be on an absolute ration basis.
Though the crops were good this
year, there will be probably so much
'organization' that food wUl spoil,"
said one critical German.
At present each family is entitled
to eight different kinds of food cards.
They are for bread, potatoes, sugar,
fats, milk, meat eggs and one for
certain dried vegetables, saccharine
and oatmeaL Because of the growing
shortage of marmalade and cheese,
two more cards may be added to the
list
The lack of sugar, tin and rubber
have prevented many families from
doing their own canning and have
had a big effact on the canning fac
tories. The factories are using sac
charine and a syrup made from car
rots for sweetening. Because of the
shortage of tin, many factories are
drying food heretofore canned. Fami

This year's harvest was about 25

But because of the necessity of
creating a surplus in case next

more wheat and oats will be avail
able for present consumption than in
the past few months, according to

The socialists and some of the
newspapers are beginning to criticise

Because of a growing shortago of
