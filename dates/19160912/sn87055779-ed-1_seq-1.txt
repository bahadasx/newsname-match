Ni:V YORK, Sept. 12. The first

transportation comiltnies of the city.
A trolley operated by a "preen" mo

The injured, live suffering with

Ftvor Trains Opera to I.
The general strike situation today
was. from the viewpoint of the
transportation-seeking public, worse
than at any other time. There was a
marked diminution in the number
of trairvs operated in the subway and
and on the elevated lines. Service
on both was far below normral. On
the surface lines transportation was
completely crippled.
The traction oltieials kept the sur
face cars in the barns until 7 a. m.,
an hour later than usual. When
they were sent out with crews that
had remained loyal, their number
was wholly inadequate to accommo
date the thousands that have used
them daily in oing- to work.
The traction companies claimei
to be makint; progress, but the strike
leaders answered this by pointing
out the diminished service on the
subway ;tnd elevated, and made the
counter claim that hundreds of em
ployes who had at first remained
loyal, had joined the union rank.
Abandonment of the plan to call
out all the trade unions in New York
city and limit the proposed sympa
thetic strike to labor organizations
directly concerned with the opera
tions of the traction companies had
the effect of turninv: public senti
ment toward the strikers. If the
sympathetic strike is tinally decided
upon, it will affect only between 60,

PROBE IM PRICE

Manipulation Will Not be Tol

Government.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Sept. 1 Man
ipulation of the prices of food prod
ucts will not be tolerated by the fed
eral government. This was the
positive stuterm-nt today of the de
partment of justice, accompanied
by the announcement that investi
gations are oing forward in every
federal judicial district to ferret out
persons seeking to mulct the public
by claiming the European war or
other elements are foreinic increased
cost of living.
It was also announce that the
federal government, through l!nitel
States district attorneys, is cooper
ating with state authorities to the
end that the repressive influence of
food product combinations may bo
national. The Sherman law ran
only reach manufacturers and deal
ers in interstate business, but nearly
all of the states have statutes under
which they can punish local com
binations. In the few plates the com
mon law against monopolies will be
invoked.
In all probability the federal trade
commission will take a hand in the
inquiry.
I'nder the new federal policy of
ail opting a paternal rather than a
punitive attitude toward business, it
is believed an attempt will be made
to settle many of the difficulties aris
ing from the food prices increases
out of court and this will involve
the services of the federal trade
commission. Officials believe here
that the present price boost will be
short lived owini; to the attention
the government is turning upon the

NKAV VOKK. Sept. 12. Following
is a resume of the editorial com
ments of New York newspapers on
the results of the election in Maine:
World Neither democrats nor
republicans have much to brag
pbout in the results wf the Maine
election. It v. as inev itable that
Maine would go republican. What
was in question was the size of the
majority, and the republican major
ity is anythin- but decisive. If
Maine is a barometer of the national
election, the national election is still
on the knees of the gods. It is evi
dent that the democrats have ob
tained a percentage of the progres
sive vote, which, if they can hold it.
is larse enough to turn the scale in
the national election.
Times If the state ehction in
Maine were really a barometer
showing how the presidential elec
tion was goinr. historv vvoald be
different. Haves would have been!
elec ted by a landslide ' in 1nT in
stead of by ü disputed vote: Han
cock would have become president
instead of Garfield in ISm'i; Blaine
and not Cleveland would have been
elected in and Ilryan would
have defeated Taft overwhelmingly
in 1 iJ 0 S . It is plain that Roosevelt
carried mot of th progressives
with him into the republican camp
The vote in Maine does not decide
presidential elections and. save in
landslide years, is no great indica

republicans made a, clean rwoop in
the Maine elections esterday. They
elected the governor, two United

a suite auditor, and by wresting
control of the Maine house from
the democrats will be able on a

Bater returns today increased
most of the republican margins of
victory. The total vote was the sec

and the final returns may put the
total above the high water mark.

Sun The returns indicate that
the republicans and former pro
gressives of Maine came together in
a wave that closed over the demo
cratic hopes of a "victory in Sep
tember." Such analysis of the vote
as could be made at this time shows
that the republicans of Maine, split
so badly in IUI- that Taft ran third,
came together yesterday smoothly
and solidly.
Tribune The returns so far re
