DR. W. S. OARY TO LEAVE.
Has Purchased Pharmacy in Rogue
River, Oregon.
Dr. W. S. Gary, for 21 years a
pharmacist and practicing physician
of Dallas, has purchased the Rogue
River Pharmacy in Rogue River, Ore
gon, and will leave within a week for
his new home. Mrs. Carv and her
mother, Mrs. G. P. Aldrich, plan to
leave a week or two after Dr. Curv
goes. ' Dr. Cary at one time was a
partner of Conrad Stafrin in the drug
business. Dr. Cary will keep his 11-
acre apple orchard on the Salem road.
Rogue River 1s a town ofr about 500
people, Dr. Cary says, but tile towns
people confidently expect that the
Diamond Match Company will soon
build a large mill on the site already
purchased. It is thought the pro
posed mill will employ from 50 to
100 men. Rogue River, says the doe
tor, is situated in a mountain nest
and the climate is very nearly ideal.

Rev. T. J. Hazleton, financial sec
retary of The Oregon Prisoner's Aid
society, was the speaker at the un
ion service which was held in the
Evangelical church on Sunday even
ing. A fair-sized audience was pres
ent and gave appreciative and sym
pathetic attention to his message. He
plead for a square deal for the man
who, partly as the result of 'his own
discretion, and often more largely
through the improper handling of his
case, has come to be classed with the
" down and onts," Among other
things, he said that prisoners would
never have a square deal until the
management of our prisons became
divorced from politics. Politics is
largely to blame for the placing in
office of incompetent superintendents,
wardens, chaplains, and other offici
als. The state has a right to punish
criminals, but it has no right to de
prive them of their health, exposing
them to tuberculosis and other wast
ing diseases as is the case under the
present system of confinement in un
sanitary cells, which prevails in so
many of our prisons. In addition to
his plea for a square deal for those
in confinement. Mr. Hazleton plead
for a square deal for the man who
has paid the penalty of his crime and
who is making an lionest effort to
make good in society and the struggle
for a livelihood.
In closing he spoke of the work ac
complished by the society during the
year lflla. Some items noted were,
83 prisoners eared for. 159 city and
county prisoners supplied with tern-
norarv homes. 2 returned to their
families and friends, some of these as
far away as England and Scotland.
47 prisoners' families were assisted,
8 husbands and wives were reunited.
2,000 letters were written to prisoners
and their families. 292 investiga
tions were made the superintendent
and his assistants. 60 religious ser
vices were conducted in prison. 56
prisoners received legal advice, 43
were defended. 60 discharged pris
oners were provided with work that
proved to be permanent in character.
199 odd jobs were secured.
This union service will close the
series for this season, but the ar
rangement has proved so satisfactory
to all who participated that no doubt
another series will be arranged for
next summer.
Applies For Citizenship.
George L. F. Isenhagen, a native of
Germany but now living on Route
two, Dallas, has filed papers with the
county clerk asking for citizen's pa
pers. Isenhagen arrived in Hoboken,
N. J January 8, 1900, and has oeen
a resident of Polk county for the
past few years. His application was
signed by Lavton A., James T,
James C. and Samuel E. Guthrie.
Aged Veteran Takes Trip.
Jasper Louper and wife have gone
to Hay, Wash., where they expect to
spend several weeks with their son,
who is an extensive wheat farmer in
that section. Mr. Louper is the old
est member of the local G. A. R. post,
but despite his advanced age of 83, he
is still able to travel and get about.
Cyrus S. Hatch was struck and al-,
most instantly killetl about seven,
Sunday morning, at Main and Wash
ington streets by an automobile driv
en by Weldon Black. Deatft was due
to a fracture of the base of the skull.
The dead man was 73 years old and
was an employe of Plaster's livery
stable. The coroner's jury, called to
investigate the cause of death, yes
terday morning, returned a verdiet
that Hatch was killed through care
less automobile driving by Weldon
Black.
With three guests in their Ford wu
tomobile Mr. and Mrs. Weldon Black
left the 'home of Oliver Chase Sun
day morning between 6:30 and 7 a,
m. Mr. Black drove east on Wash
ington street to the intersection of
Main. Mr. Hatch was walking west
on Washington street to his work at
Plaster's barn. Instead of obeying
the ordinance and circling the sema
phore Black cut to the left of the
semaphore. Black did not take the
stand at yesterday's hearing and
Dewey Inman, one of the automobile
passengers, said on the stand that he
did not know at what speed the ma
chine was traveling and that his
slight experience with automobiles
did not give him basis for making a
judgment. Automobile drivers who
visited the scene of the accident Sun
day and Monday say that, from the
Jappearance of the machine 'tracks
made when Black tried to stop, the
automobile was going at 15 or 20
miles an hour. .
When struck Hatch was thrown
slightly to the right of the machine,
the back of his skull striking the
pavement. The occipital bone at the
base of the brain was injured and
Dr. V. C. Staats, the physician sum
moned by Dewey Inman, testified thut
death was due to a fracture of the
base of the skull. ' The accident vic
tim lived five minutes after Dr. Staats
arrived. Coroner Chapman was no
tified and the body was immediately
taken to Chapman's undertaking par-
lore. The funeral will be held from
the parlors today at two p. m., Rev.
Howard McConnell of the Christian
church reading the service. Interment
will be in the I. O. O. F. cemetery.
The pallbearers will be: Gus Mar
tin, J. A. McCann, W. G. Campbell,
Peter Greenwood, Sr., Mike Kelly
and Jim Boydston.
Miss Myrtle Chase, a passenger in
the car corroborated Inman '3 testi
mony as to the accident. Both Mr.
Inman and Miss Chase said on the
witness stand that Black had cut
the corner. When asked to take the
stand Mr. Black said that he could
say no more than already had been
stated by witnesses, Miss Chase, Dew
ey Inman, H. G. Campbell, who r
rived at the scene hcilly after the
accident, and Dr. V. C. Staats. Mrs.

Black and Oslia Tate, in the car at
the time of the accident, did not tes
tify. In charge of Coroner Chapman
and Prosecuting Attorney Sibley the
jury was taken to the scene of the ac
cident from the undertaking parlors.
the verdict was returned shortly af
ter return. The members of tJie jury
were: Oteorge A. Muscott, foreman
C. L. Hubbard, Will Tatom, N.
Guy, S. M. Ray and- W. R. Coulter.
The text of the verdict is as fol
lows: "that Cyrus A. Hatch came to
his death on Sunday, September 10,
1916 at about seven a. m. bv strik
ing the base of his skull on the con
crete pavement at the intersection of
Main and Washington streets in Dal
las, Polk county, Oregon, said fall be
ing caused by said Cyrus S. Hatch
being struck with the automobile driv
en by one Weldon Black. We further
find that said Weldon Black did all
in his power to avert the accident.
but find that said Weldon Black was
careless in the matter in not driving
his car on the proper side of the
street and turning the corner as pro
vided by the ordinances of the city of
Dallas and the laws of the state of
Oregon. ' '
Prosecuting Attorney Sibley said
yesterday that the facts would be
placed before the grand jury. Local
lawyers say that two lactionSi are
possible: civil and criminal. The
question of a criminal action will de
pend upon the decision of the grand
jury; the question of a civil action
rests with the relatives of the dead
man..
' In the street discussions bf the ac
cident opinion is generally that Black
was careless but that 'the violation
of the ordinance is common among
local automobilists. Even city offic
ials, people say, cut the corners and
yesterday morning a county official
violated the ordinance. Residents of
Washington street have often said
that a majority of the machines mak
ing the curve at Washington and TJg-
low avenue disregard the speed and
corner turning ordinance. Men on
Washington street say that automo
biles constantly speed past the ordin
ance limit in traveling on that street.
One man thought 'he could pick up 50
machines w day, on this street alone,
for violating the law.
Cyrus S. Hatch, the dead man,
came to Dallas three years ago from
Union City, Pa. He was 73 years
of age and had been employed in the
Plaster livery barn. He is survived
by Mrs. Hatch and children. Mrs.
Terry Driscoll and Miss Edna Hatch
of this city, Mrs. Martin Ixop of
Union City, Pa., and J. B. Hatch ot
Rallston. J. B. Hatch arrived' in
Dallas yesterday morntng ind the
preparations for the funeral were
started. Mrs. J. B. Hatch is expect
ed today.

man and a horse the year around with
small loads of crushed rock placed at
intervals or half a mile or such a

work the road over continually. He
received perhaps $2.50 a day for the
work."
ARE TALKING ROUND-UP.
ROADIPATROl PLEASES
EUGENE MAN FINDS SYSTEM
USED THROUGHOUT EAST.
Lane County People Are Interested in
Plan for Road Preservation. ' ' Suc
- cessful" Says Observer.
Because of the fact that copious
rains during the past week have prob
ably eliminated all danger of forest
fires for the balance of the season,
District Warden Fuller has called in
practically all of the fire patrolmen
which are serving under his jurisdic
tion in Polk county. During the sum
mer season of the present year there
have been bnt two fires in Polk, coun
ty's magnificent timber, and both of
these were discovered before they had
reached any proportions. One of these
was in Patrolman V. E. Gosso'a dis
trict, in the headwaters of the Sick
reall and the other was in the bead
waters of the Siletz, in Patrolman
Art Hays' district There wa no
damage in either ease.
This year's record is in keeping
with that set by Mr. Fuller's dis
trict during the past several years,
since 1910 in fact, during which time
there have been no fires of any con
sequence and the fire low to timber
in Polk county has been very alight
Two years ago me trestles were
burned bat no timber was lost

Throughout the east the roads are
better where road patrol is practiced,
according to F. R. Wetherbee of Eu
gene, who recently eompleted a 9000
miles tour of 24 states. Mr. Wether
bee returned firmly convinced that
road patrol is the only successful and
economical system of road mainten
ance and preservation.
"The patrol roads we found in the
east," said Mr. Wetherbee, "were
distinctly better than others. The pa
trol system is gaining friends, too.
Where we spend thousands of dol
lars to build a road, then let it go
until it is necessary to spend thous
ands more dollars to replace it the
patrol system, at a very low expendi
ture comparatively, keeps the road
like a boulevard the year around.
"We stopped to inquire of a pa
trolman the way on a road in Mary
land one day, and I questioned him
concerning the patrol system. He
told me be had a district extending
28 miles. It was like a boulevard.
It had been built fiv years before..

Detail.
BETTERMENTS ARE FEW
CITY STOPS IMPROVEMENTS
UNTIL THE COMING YEAR
Thirty - Thousand Square Feet of
Sidewalks and Construction of
- Curbs on Burch Only Work.
Comparatively speaking, Dallas as
a municipality has experienced few
improvements during the present sea
son, a lull coming after the storm, as
it were. Last year extensive street
betterments were indulged in, some
thing like twenty one blocks having
been macadamized and concrete curbs
constructed on either side of the
thoroughfares thus improved. This
year the alderinanic body is satisfy
ing itself by causing the construction
of sidewalks in districts where they
have become dilapidated by long use.
Early in the spring the council ex
tended the area of the concrete side
walk distrfct, and later declared its
intention to cause the rebuilding of
board walks, serving notice upon
property holders to this effect. The
order met with general approval on
the part of those affected, and not
only have these laid concrete walks
in front of their premises but many
others sought, and gained permission
to come within the provisions of the
ordinance. As a result approximate
ly 30,000 square feet of concrete side
walk has been completed, the Barham
Warehouse & Manufacturing com
pany having the contract at 14 cents
per foot. In addition to this about
750 feet of board walk has been
built, the cost per lineal foot being
25 cents.
The only street improvement aside
from this has been the construction
of cement curbs on Burch street,
Holmes & Grant having a contract
for the building of 864 lineal feet on
this thoroughfare. It is the purpose
of the council to macadamize Burch
street in the near future. The ex
pense of the improvement will fall
upon the Southern Pacific railway
company.
VALUE DOUBLES ENROUTE.
Charges on Prunes to East More
Than Original Price.
A carload of green prunes shipped
from Dallas Saturdav to Omaha will
more than double in value before the
journey's end. Invoiced at 30 cents
crate to the grower the value of
the shipment to the Polk county orig
inator is $300. At $1.25 a hundred
the freight rate on the 1000 crates to
Omaha or Chicago is $350 and the
icing charge on the ear will be $62.50,
making a total of $412.50, laid down J
in Omaha. In other words, transpor
tation to Omaha increases the origi
nal valne of he green prunes by
112.5 per cent
HOPPKKER JAILED YESTERDAY
It is no longer, necessary to attach
a revenue stamp to a freight or ex
press bill when you want 10 ship
goods; it will no longer cost you- an
extra penny when you telephone at
long distance or send a telegram; you

and which became effective last Sat
urday, business men have been re
lieved of the stamp tax which has
been in effect since December, 1914,
