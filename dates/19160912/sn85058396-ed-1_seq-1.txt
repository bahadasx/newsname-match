BRITISH VIOLATE
U. S, NEUTRALITY
i
Torpedo Boat Holds Up and
Examines Philippine Steam
er Cebu Within Terri
torial Waters.
Washington. Sept. 12. Violation of
American neutrality by a British tor
pedo boat which held up and exam
ined the Philippine steamer Cebu
within the territorial waters of the
Philippines was reported to the war
department today by Governor-General
Harrison. The dispatch immediate
ly was transmitted to the state de
partment and will be made tho sub
ject of a vigorous protest to Great
Britain.
The incident occurred yesterday,
one mile and a half off Carabao isl
and. According to the report of the
steamer's master, Lieutenant Bailes
commanding H. M. S. destroyer No. 2
boarded the Cebu, made inquiries
about her progress and took both the
ship's manifest and her cargo list Ap
parently the officer was searching for
a man named Bady, who was not
found.
On releasing the Cebu, the lieuten
ant made this note on her log:
"Boarded at 3:50 a, m., 9-11-16, ex
amined and passed."
There has been more than ono com
plaint about tho activity of the Brit
ish vessels around the Philippines
and while Governor-General Harri
son's report furnishes the basis for a
specific protest it is probable that
Great Britain will bo called upon to re
strict the operations of her patrolling
squadron generally in and near the
territorial waters of tho islands. In
order that there might be no mlstako
about where the Cebu was at the
time she was held up, her exact
position was given by the master as
follows:
Latitude 14 degrees 16 minutes,
longitude 120 degrees 35 minutes, or
one and a half miles from Carabao
island.

TO INVESTIGATE
BRIDGE COLLAPSE
Opening of Bridge, Scheduled
for Spring, Indefinitely
Postponed. Quebec, SepL 12. The St. Law
rence Bridge company and the Quebec
bridge commission are conducting a
joint investigation today into the col
lapse of the central span of the Que
bec cantilever bridge over the St.
Iawrence river while It was being
hoisted into position. The death list re
mains at eleven.
Accounts of survivors of the disas
ter and spectators are at hopeless
variance, some holding that the span
itself buckled first, and others that
the hoisting supports did not work
uniformly, thereby throwing too much
strain on the supports.
Engineers In charge of the con
struction work said today that as soon
as the cause of the accident is as
ceitained the work of either con
structing a new span or raising the
collapsed one would be immediately
undertaken It was estimated the
work will cost $1,000,000.
The opening of the bridge, sched
uled for next spring, has been indef
initely postponed. Quebec harbor of
ficials, on finding that the fallen span
did not block the ship channel, per
mitted today the resumption of navi
gation by ocean going vessels.

tial that France and England should
not be hostile towards Spain.
