Struma, but declared the Bulgars have been successful.
On the southeastern Rumanian frontier and on the
western and eastern battle fronts no events of great im
portance have occurred in the past twenty four hours.

PAPERS AND
PARTY MANAGERS
SAY OF ELECTION
New York World Says Neither
Party Has Much to Brag
About
SUN SAYS PROGRESSIVES
HAVE RETURNED TO FOLD
Willcox Thinks He Is Pleased
and McCormick Has No
Sad Song to Sing
New York, Sept. 12. Democratic and
republican papers of New York ngreed
today that the result of the Maine elec
tion indicates the progressive vote in
that state has swung back to the re
publicans. They disagree only on the
significance of the election from a
national standpoint,!
The World (democrat) says: "Neith
er democrats nor i republicans have
much to brag abou in the results of
the Maine election. It was inevitable
that Maine should go republican. The
republican majority, is anything but
decisive. Jf Maine is a barometer of
the national election, the national elec
tion is still on the knees of the gods."
Tribune (republican):" The early re
turns from Maine indicate a decisive
republican victory. Auy plurality on
the state ticket exceeding ten thous
and must be considered as reviving the
old traditions of republican supremacy
in Maine."
Sun (republican): "The returns in
dicate that the republicans nnd former
progressives came together in a wave
that closed over the democratic hopes i
of a "September Victory '. ..Such analy
sis of the vote as could be made last
night shows the republican party in
Maine was reunited yesterday
smoothly and solidly The demo
crats have been asking what the re
publicans were going to do. The ans
wer has come."
Times (democrat): "It is plain that
Roosevelt carried most of the progres
sives witii him into the republican
ramp. It appears probable, too, that
more of the new voters supported the
republicans than the democratic candi
dates. The vote in Maine does
not decide presidential elections, nnd,
save in landslide years is no great in
dication of their decision. Such com
fort as this election does give, however,
is republican comfort. It remains to
be seen whether in other states the
progressives will return ns generally
as they did in Maine, or whether, as
in 18711, 1880, 1!1H and 11)08, Maiue
has merely shown that she was out of
step with the nation."
Party Managers Views
New York, Sept. 12. lie publicans
are caul idem nnd gratified and demo
crats are encouraged and satisfied with
the results of the Maine elections of
yesterday, according to statements of
the leaders of both parties today.
While the republicans claimed the elec
tions indicate a complete reunion of
the republican and progressive parties
the democrats maintained that later
figures will show that a large percent
age of the progressives voted tiie demo
cratic ticket.
Chairman Willcox of the republican
national committee in commenting on
the election suid: ' (
"1 regard the Maiue result as nn
indication of the certainty of election
of Hughes and l'airbanks in November.
The election has proved we arc a re
united party. That means success in
the campaign. The administration
turned loose its cabinet members and
best speakers in Maine and made a
fight for tH support of the administra
tion and this vote is nml will be de
termined by the people of the country
as Maine's" verdict on the administra
tion. I was with Mr. Hughes for nn
hour last night and be feels very much
gratified over the result in Maine."
Chiiirllinn McCormick of the demo
cratic national committee smiled ami
told tho newspapermen he hail no sad
song to sing."
McCormick saul: A plummy or u"
nroximatelv onlv ten thousand in eom-i
pnrison witn mo rcpuniican pnirun.i"
III .tiaillC IH pal Jrs, imuiuirD
this is a democratic year and that Pres
ident Wilson will be re-elected. I think
this is particularly significant, when
it is realized that President Wilson is
stronger by far than the local ticket in
Maine, according to ncmces wun-u
come to nie.
" r most certainly do not concede a
general return of progressives to tho
republican party. I have not yet had.
time to analyze all of the figures but
reports tell me that the I democratic
party got a gooiHy percentage of the
progressive votes and I am positive
that we will get at least 25 per cent
of the progressives in the presidential
elections.
"You must remember this was a lo
cal election. President Wilson's name
was not on the ballot and 1 am sure
that if it hail been the democratic par
ty wou'.d have polled ten thousand
more votes."

iien ouciou, isopr. iz. supporting
their claim that the Carrnnzn regime
is now in a strong position and that
its strength will become even greater,
the Mexican commissioners announced
here today that a call for a constitu
tional convention may be momentarily
expected. The convention will be fal
lowed by stnte and presidential elec
tions. The convention is expected to
sit before the first of next year.
The morning conference between the
American nud Mexican commissioners
today was given over to consideration
of political developments In Mexico
since the Aguas Calientes convention.
All of the commissioners called on
President Wilson today to pay their
respects at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
American farmers to till Mexican
soil and American teachers to train
Mexican minds that wns a plan before
the American-Mexican peace commis
sion today.
Such a program was intended to be
part of Mexico's contemplated regen
eration. The commission ngreed that
it would be feasible.
: As formulated thus far, the scheme
is. only to have such numbers of Amer
icans ns will set an example for the
Mexicans and there is every intention
to avoid anything that smacks of Amer
ican interference or control.
Country Blooms Again
The Mexicans presented data today,
supplementing yesterday ' on rail
roads, to show that there is an honest
effort to make the rich country below
the Rio Grande blossom anew after six
years of civil strife. They told tiiXi
American commissioners that while
crops in some parts of Mexico hnve suf
fered from lack of labor, other por
tions show a remarkable productive
ness. These essential underlying economic
problems wjll be thoroughly probed be
fore the question of withdrawing Amer
ican troops is determined definitely.
Iloth sides agree that work must be
provided, anil that the uneducated must
be taught before Mexico can have any
assurnnce of continued, progress.
President Wilson's presence In New
Ijondon, six miles from- the (iriswold
iiotel, commission headipinrters, had no
effect iinon the meetings. The Amer
ican group explained that their visit j
there lust night was strictly to pay
their condolences and not to talk Mex
ican mutters.
Secretary of the Interior T.nnc and
his conferees hoped to be nble to re
port to the president within the next
few days a definite plan contemplat
ing the' withdrawal of American forces
from Mexico and restriction of the bor
der patrol with fewer men than lit
present.
CROPS BETTER THAN
LAST YEAR BUT FOOD
SUPPLY STILL LIGHT
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(1'nited Press stuff correspondent.)
lerliu, Sept. 12. The German people
are becoming more and more dissutis-
fied with the new government food ue- i
pnrrment. The optimistic statements of j
Herr Von Bntocki, the new "food dis-
tntor" about the food outlook led the!
people to believe that by fall condi
tions would be greatly improved. But
instead of becoming m re plentiful,'
food supplies are becoming more and
more organized until within a short;
time, if the distribution of cards is con-!
tinued, food will be on an absolute ra
tions basis.
"Tliougli the crops were good this
year, there will be probably so much
'organization' that food will spoil,"
said one critical German.
At present each family is entitled to
eight different kinds of food cards.
They ore for brend, potatoes, sugar,
fats, milk, meat, eggs and one for cer
tain dried vegetables, saccharine and
ostmeal. Because of the growing short
age of tnurmulade ami cheese two more
cards may be added to the list.
The luck of sugar, tin and rubber
have prevented many families from do
ing their own canning and have had a
big effect on the canning factories. The
IS SUEE OF INDIANA
New York, Sept. 12. A
sweeping democratic victory in
Indians is predicted by United
States Senator Thomas Taggart.
"President Wilson and the
democratic ticket will carrv
Indiana by fifty thousand,''
the senator told Chairman Mc
Cormick of the democratic na
tional committee
TO PROVE AN ALIBI
Says He Was at Sister-in-Law's
Night of Murder
She Corroborates It
Hillsboro, Or., Sept. 12. Bennett
Thompson, ranch hand, on the witness
stand in his own defense today denied
that be killed Mrs. Helen Jennings and
rred Kistman, a jitneur, at the Gore
ranch, last May.
At the time the state alleges he was
murdering Mrs. Jennings with a sledge
and beating Kistman to death with a
hammer, Thompson declared ho was at
tho home of his sister-in-law, Mrs.
James Thompson, 'preparing , milk for
the baby.
This alibi was supported by the evi
dence of Mrs. Thompson herself. She
asserted tho accused man was at her
home all during the night of the double
murder.
It is alleged Thompson killed Mrs.
Jennings when she scorned his ad
vances and then disposed of Ristmnn,
whom ho had hired to drive him to the
ranch to cover his tracks.
Wants President to
Call Special Session
Chicago, Sept. 12. A special session
of congress to ptsa a national woman
suffrage amendment was suggested to
President Wilson today by Miss Alico
Paul, Washington, D. C, chairman of
the congresional committee of the wom
nns party. Miss Paul's statement fol
lows: "The overwhelming defeat of tnc
democratic forces in Maine indiVi
how necessary to Mr. Wilson will be
91 elcctornl votes In the 12 states
where women vote, so as to enable
him to win in November.
"Wo suggest to Mr. Wilson that he
take heed before it is too late and call
a special session of congress to pass the
national woman suffrage amendment.
Only in this way can he hope to avert
the vote against him and his party in
these 12 doubtful western states of
the members of the wumnns party."
To Make Another
Camapign In West
New York, Sept. 12. The socond
campaign trip of Charles K. Hughes,
republican presidential candidate, will
begin Monday after a five day rest
following his five weeks trip closing to
day. On September 1!) Hughes will do
liver an address at the state fair in
Springfield, III., where he will mnko
a night address.
T:ie remainder of his Itinerary is yet
to be announced.
FOE FIAX GROWERS
Stute Treasurer Kay has made ar
rangements with l.ndd k Hush Hank
to handle the flax deficit, so that flax
growers willvuon get their money.
factories are using saccharine and a
syrup made from carrots for sweetening
iiecauso of the shortage of tin many
factories aro drying food heretofore
canned. Families that forgot to bhvc
rubber bands from Inst year's fruit jars
discovered that their fruit was doomed
to spoil this year. j
This year's harvest wus about 2"
per cent better than last year's, mak-1
ing it a normal peace time harvest. But
because of the necessity of creating
a surplus in case next year's harvest
is not so good, no more wheat and oats
will be available for present consump
tion than in the past few months, ac
cording to present plum.
The socialists and some of the news
papers are beginning to criticise the
food department.
Because of a growing shortage of
milk, new regulations have been posted
whereby milk is to be delivered to fam
ilies with childrea under 10 and to sick
people. Special milk cords are given
to families showing birth certificates of
their children, each child receiving one
liter (a little over a quart) a day.
An optimist is a person thoroughly
imbued with the idea that the beat
things bnve never happened.

The reunited party made a clean

It increased republican strength in th
state legislature.
Two years ngo the progressive guber

18,000 votes and the democrats won by

15,000 votes. There were only a few
scattered precincts to be heard from at
noon today and the republicans cluimed
15,000 would bo practically the total of
their majority.
In other words, they claimed that
practically 100 per cent of the bull
moose had returned to the old party.
The republican victory was made im
pressive in the fact that their fight
