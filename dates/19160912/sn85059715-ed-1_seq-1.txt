PRETTY NEW STEALEY HEIGHTS
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH
Q O
Which is Being Dedicated All
This Week with Most Fit
ting Ceremonies.
About fifteen months ago the
Methodist people of Stenley Heights
j began actively to plan the building
of a church. On July 7. 1015, the j
i building committee met at the tab
ernacle and decided to employ A. G.
Lamont. architect, to draw plans for |
a new church. This work being ac
complished. C. T. Stealey was en
gaged an builder on September 21.'
11)15. The corner stone was laid
November 14. 1915. by the pastor,
the Uev. C. W. Wise, assisted by the
Rev. A. S. Arnett. of Adamston.
Thus is written the history of the
progress of building the splendid edl-i
llc?* shown above, which is to be for
mally dedicated next Sunday. It Ih .
a striking example of the modern
and up-to-date church. Every detail i
from the selection of the building
committee to the final finishing touch 1
| in the decoration, was made only af
ter due consideration and rare judg- 1
Iment. Those who had the work in;
charge are to bo congratulated upon
the result they have achieved.
The plan is ideal. The auditorium,:
while uot large, is well appointed,
having one main and two minor en-:
trances which lead into it at most!
j convenient points. The Sunday school I
I room is so placed that the large |
I sliding doors which separate the two
| rooms, may be thrown open and the
two rooms as one giving *a total \
[seating capacity of about 650.
The rear of the Sunday school!
'room being curved, gives an added j
i advantage, in that all the pupils, or
members of an audience naturally
face the one in charge of the service.
The infant department leads off from
the main Sunday school room and
may be used independently or in con
i nection therewith. The little tots
have their own private entrance and
[ toilet, room, and may enter or leave
without interrupting the main school.
The basement is divided Into a
gymnasium, a combination dining
and Sunday school room, kitchen,
rooms for toilets and heating and
ventilating apparatus. The location ;
of the rooms are well planned and |

I yisll (be (jootU,
have every convenience for the pur
pose for which they are well planned.
The architecture is most pleasing,
following the lines of the perpendic
ular period of the English Gothic
style. The detail of the exterior
while refined and in strict keeping
with this style is not overdone.
The general appearance of the
building is one of refinement, dignity
and repose, and when the vines which
are to he planted alonge the base of
the walls have grown and are cling
ing to the brick surface, it will re
mind one of the old parish churches
of England, and make him feel that
he is welcome within its doors and
that, should he enter, he would find
within rest, and peace for his soul.
After one enters he is not disappoint
ed and feels that he could well af
ford to tarry awhile.
The auditorium, while rather sim
ple in plan and decoration, is for this
reason very attractive and the many
original features which were success
i fully carried out. give it a distinction
not to bo found in many churches
! even though much more money was
expended in their erection.
The building committee and mem
bers are loud in theJr praise and ad
miration ot the work of the archi
tect, A. G. Lamont, who has person
ally assisted in the detailing of tho
work. He is an artist, and knows
well the needs of the modern church
as to its working plant.
This remarkable accomplishment
for such a young church organization
If nothinc less than heroic. It were
not possible had not tho members
and friends of the church great loy
alty and co-operation linked with the
spirit of sacrifice. Well may they hei
proud, when, on next Sabbath day,
September 17, under the supervision |
and guidance of Bishop Franklin,
Hamilton, of Pittsburg, they dedicate]
to the worship and glory of God this
beautiful church.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 12.?Viola
tion of American neutrality by a Brit
ish torpedo boat, which held up and
examined the Philippine steamer,
Cebu, within the territorial waters of
the Philippines, wa? reported to the
war department Tuesday by Governor
General Harrison. The despatch Im
mediately was transmitted to the
state department and will be made
the subject of a vigorous protest to
Great Britain.
The Incident occurred Monday a
mile and a half ofT Cnrabao Island.
According to the report of the steam
er's master, Lieutenant Balles, com
manding H. M. S. destroyer No. -2,
boarded the Cebu, made Inquiries
about Its passengers and took both
the ship's manifest and Its passenger
list. Apparently the officer was
searching for a man named Bady who ,
was not found.
On releasing the Cebu made this
note on its log:
"Boarded at 3:40 a. m., 9-11-16,
examined and passed."
There has been more than one
complaint about the activity of the
British vessels around the Philippines
and while Governor General Harrl- j

specific protest It Is probable that
Great Britain will be called upon to |
restrict the operating of Its patroll
