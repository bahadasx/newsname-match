AUGUSTA, Me., Sept. 12. "As
Maine goes, so goes tbe country." If
this old political adage is to hold
true In the 1916 election, Charles
Evan Hughes will be the next presi
dent of the United States..
g ji"i'
Practically complete returns from
the election yesterday ahow that the
republicans have carried the state by
12,000 majority, sweeping' the sena
torial and congressional offices.
Suporters of Hughes are jubilant.
They are taking the vote in Maine as
an indication of tho whole country's
j vote. They have ground for this
reasonlng because of tbe old political
adage. The vote of Maine for a re
turn of republicanism is expected to
have a moral effect in every other
state. At least politicians take it that
way.
More than 250 different political
addresses before that many different
crowds were delivered in various
parts of Maine Saturday. Hughes has
been here, besides most of the mem
bers of Wilson's cabinet and many
prominent senators from many states.
The vote in 1912 for president was:
Democrats 51,113, progressives 48,
493, republicans 26,545.
The progressive vote yesterday
amounted to little or nothing. . The
republican victory hence shows that
most of the 48.493 progressives of
1912 have gone back to tbe repub
lican ranks.
