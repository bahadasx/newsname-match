Not lone since the Manufacturers'
Kecord devoted a page of its Issue to
a write-up of a gas well that was
making thirty million cubic feet. Not
many months ago In an Oklahoma
town a holiday was declared and the
people met and rejoiced over the
bringing in of a well that made two
million feet of gas. These things are
stated that the people may know how
much enthusiasm great publications
and the people have when gas Is
found. Ardmore must not be un
mindful of the fact that it has the
greatest gas area hi the entire stale
of Oklahoma. Nowhere in Oklahoma
is there such a gas field as Vox has
already proven to be nnd Oklahoma Is
the greatest gas and oil state in the
Union. There is no estimating what
this gas area will be worth to the
city. A 6 Inch line is now beng built
from Ardmore into the field and a 3
luch line iH already completed Into
t- ti.Io iii pive this citv two

linen aggregating tune inches into
the new field. This most wonderful
gas .leld will give Aruinore cheap fuel
for domestic use nnd cheap fuel for
factories for many years to come. We
can send out to the world that we
have the railway facilities and we
have the fuel and inv.'te factories here
by the score.
Three wonderful sands have al
ready been found by two wells. One
of these sands made a production of
64,000,000 feet. A Pennsylvania oil
man who has been In all the fields of
the United States said It was the
createst gas well he ever saw. This
iwell has a pressure of something like
1 000 Dounds to the square Inch, and
iin and several drilling wells
imve been supplied from it for scv
rral months, and the production is
as good as it was tne day the gas
sand was drilled into. Only last night
another gas sand that will make forty
million feet was drilled a half nil if
awav. This opens tip a great gas
area. The sand In the last well was

different sand; it is a separate sand
It means that three great gas produc

area.
In speaking of the Fox district some
weeks ago W. K. Johnson of tins city
stated that if an oil area were de-
.olnnoil flier,, that railroad would
be built from Ardmore to It. If the
Santa Fe road does not construct the
line some other company will do so.
In this regard It may be noted that
through private sources Information
has reached here that an engineer in
Atlanta, Ga., has already been con
sulted with reference to making a
Ardmore to Fox. and
also to make a survey of a proposed
water power plant on the Washita
Iliver north of this city. It Is said
that abundant capital is behind both
of these plans and within from thirty
lo sixty days fiom now there will be
In all probability some developments
along this line that will be good news
to people who are anxious to see Ard
more grow into one of the biggest
cities of the state.
(If Ardmore with tts natural re
rources and with its wealth does not
make city of fifty thousand people
we will be Bleeping upon our rights.

that Premier Zaimis has ten

every effort is being made to
persuade him to withdraw it.
The political situation in the
far east is of no less interest
to European capitals at thin
moment than the military out
look, as it is believed that
changes are impending. The
reasons for Zaimis' resignation
are not set forth in the Athens
dispatches. It is believed, his

fact that he accepted the post
