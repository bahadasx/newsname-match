FIRE fOdi PEN!
Officials Believe Convicts Start
ed $160,000 Blaze.
Third Mysterious Fire in Prison
in Two Months.
Jefferson City, Kept. 12. Convicts
are accused of having caused the fire
within the stockade of the Missouri
state prison here early this morning
that caused a loss on the shop of the
Oberman Clothinrr company estimated
at $160,000. It was the third mysteri
ous fire in prison shops within the last
two months.
The fire early todav was discovered
shortly after midnight and burned un
til nearly 4 o'clock. Efficient work
by the Jefferson City fire department,
aided by the prison company confined
the fire to the three story building in
thj stockade occupied by the clothing
company.
Penitentiary authorities declared to
day they were satisfied the fire like
the other two, had been set by con
victs. Double guard has been set
around the shop br.ildings, practically
all of this month and Ftrenuous ef
forts are being made, it was given out,
to ascertain the identity of those who
started the blaze. To baffle the au
thorities further is the fact that no
convicts are in the shops at night and
officials cannot understand how the
blaze could have been set.
Started in Third Story.
One of the other two fires occurred
late at night and it was given out to
day that an attempt had been made
last week to burn the building de
stroyed this morning. Today's fire
evidently was planned in advance. It
started in the third story stock room
of the building in such a way that it
might not become visible for hours
after the last convict had left the
stockade.
The loss was apportioned about
$100,000 to the oberman companv
and J60.000 to the state. The state's
loss on the other two fires was some
what in excess of $30,000. The com
panies involved in the previous confla
gration were the Oberman company,
which which lost about $30,000. and
and Central Brooin company, with a
loss of about $18,000.

At the German Front Near Kovel,
Russia, Sept. 12. The ereat "battle of
bread" has just been fought at the
village of Zwinicze between Russian,
German and Austrian troops, with the
honors about even. The Germans
captured Zwinicze, brought up their
army bakery and had just turned out
1 0,000 loaves when they were forced
to retire. The regiment on their left
flank had failed to advance and the
retirement at Zwinicze was necessary
to straighten the lines.
The German entrenched a few hun
dred yards on one side of the village.
The Russians entrenched about the
same distance on the other side.
A group of Germans slipped into
Zwinicze and started back with all
the bread they could carry. The Rus
sians saw them but insteai of firing
slipped out of their trenches for a
raid on the, bakery. The Austrians
met at the army bakery with their
arms too full of bread to light. But
when the supply began to run low.
some one drew a knife.
The battle was on in an instant,
with both sides rushing up reinforce
ments. Before it ended, the ground
around the bakery was strewn with
the dead bodies of the Russians, Ger
mans and Austrians, some of them
stiil clasping their loaves of bread.

Berlin. Sept. 12. The German peo
ple are becoming more and more dis
satisfied with the new government
food department. Rood supplies are
becoming more and more organized,
until within a short time, if the dis
tribution of cards is continued, food
will be on an absolute ration basis.
"Though the crops were good this
year, there will be probably so much
'organization' that food will spoil,'
said one critical German.
The lack of sugar, tin and rubber
has prevented many families from
doing their own canning and has had
a big effect on the canning factories.
Families that forgot to save rubber
bands from last year's fruit jars dis
covered that their fruit was doomed
to spoil this year.
FIND BODY IN RIVER
Former Washburn Professor
Believed To Be Suicide.
Charles Prosser Taught Classes
Here Several Years.
Columbus, O., Wept. 12. A fisher
man early today found the body :f
Charles S. Prosser, aged 5 0, head of
the geologic department of Ohio State
university and a well known scientific
writer, floating in the Olentangy river,
near the university campus.
Professor Prosser was considered
one of the leading authorities on
geology in this country. Friends be
lieve that his mind became deranged
and that he committed suicide. Prosser
was a graduate of Cornell university
and previous to coming to Ohio State
had been instructor at Cornell, Wash
burn college, Topeka, Kan., and at
Union college. He was the author of
more than a doen books on geology
and was a fellow in the Geological
Society of America.
Professor Prosser was an assistant
Tfnloeist of the United States geologi
cal survey and of the state geological
surveys of Kansas, New York, Ohio
and Maryland.
Doubts Suicide Theory.
Professor Prosser will be remember
ed by many of the older Washburn
alumni. He came to Washburn in the
earlv '90 s and taught natural history
and geology in the college for several
years. He wa? also a member of the
state geological survey of Kansas.
When told of Professor Pros?ers

McEachron of the college expressed
a disbelief that former Washburn
faculty man had committed suicide.
He said:

lVilson Believes President
Shouldn't Take Stump.
Consents to Add to Speech Pro

New London, Conn., Sept. 12.
President Wilson haa decided to make
a number of pre-election speeches in
addition to those already scheduled
September 20 at St. Louis and Septem
ber 24 at Baltimore.
The president reached this decision
after a talk with Homer Cummings,
vice-chairman of the Democratic Na
tional committee on the train en route
here yesterday. Cummings who is
charged with the duty of rounding up
campaign orators, told the president
he should accept a number of invita
tions extended him by organizations in
different parts of the country where
"the people are waiting to be told
why the Iemocratic administration
should be returned to power."
Where the additional speeches will
be made will be left to the judgment
of the'national committee but the
president has asked that they be con
fined so far as possible to the east.
His reason for this is that if he goes
on an extended trip Into the west, he
will be compelled to deliver numerous
platform speeches all of a political
nature and he wishes to avoid this,
believing that the president of the
United States should not campaign for
re-election.
Only Before X on-Partisan Clubs.
Cummings urged the president to
make one speech in Connecticut and
believes he may consent. The presi
dent made it clear, however, that he
will deliver no addresses before partir
san organizations or at political gath
erings of any kind. He will accept
only invitations extended him by or
ganizations non-political in character.
Next Monday Chairman "Vance Mc-
Cormick and Cummings plan to confer
with President - Wilson at Shadoiy
Lawn, relative to this feature of the'
campaign. The meeting was xty nave
been held yesterday but the Illness oi
the president's sister necessitated his
trip here, and resulted in a postpone
ment. President Wilson retired early
aboard the yacht Mayflower last night
and was not inf3rmed.of the Maine re
sults until this morning. He made no
comment.

The railroads offered the shopmen

C. Fox, named svecessor to the late
C. W. Kouns aa general manager of
Santa Fe eastern lines, Edward Ray
mond, general superintendent of the
western district of the Santa Fe east- '

Etter as superintendent of the Okla
homa division with offices in Arkansas
City. The latter two appointments, as
well as that of Mr. Raymond, become
effective September 15.
As a Section Hand.
Mr. Raymond began service with the
Santa Fe as a section hand on what
is now the middle division more than
thirty years ago.
He was promoted to section fore
man and later was named roadmaster
of a division. His next promotion
was that of trainmaster on the South
ern Kansas division. Then he was
named assistant superintendent of the
same division. Before nis appoint
ment as general superintendent of the
western division of eastern lines In
Xewton he was superintendent of the
Itlinoi division. His rise from sec
tion hand to senior superintendent of
the lines of the Santa Fe has probably
been one of the most remarkable in
western railroad annals.
Etter Was a Rodman.
- W. K. Etter, Mr. Raymond's suc
cessor, is a Pennsylvanian and was
educated in the common schools and
Dunkard college in McPherson, Kan.
He entered railway service with the
Santa Fe as a rodman in Wichita,
Kan., in June, 1891. Since then he
ha3 been consecutively, March to May,
1892, stenographer in Arkansas City;
May to September, 1892. clerk and
stenographer in trainmaster's office
in Arkansas City; April to May, 1893,
timekeeper in the master mechanic's
office in Xickerson, Kan.; May. 1893.

in the assistant superintendent's of
fice in Fort Madison; June, 1894. to

1901, to August, 1902. chief clerk to
the general superintendent in La
Junta: August. 1902. to July. 1905,
chief clerk to the general superintend
ent in Topeka: July. 1905. to January,
1906. trainmaster: January. 190fi. to
October, 1907, superintendent of Rio
Grande division in San Marcial. In
October. 1907, he was appointed suc
perintendent Oklahoma division in
Arkansas City.
Derby Deserved 1 1.
n n Derbv who goes to Arkansas
I City is well known on the Newton di
vision and other parts of the system,
i His appointment is rated by officials
as in line with the "deserved promo
tion" policy of the Santa Fe.
Mr. Raymond, it is expected, will
' be in Topeka soon to assume his new
i duties. R. J. Parker, his predecessor,
' has left Topeka for Amarillo. He is
i going over the western lines of the
road with Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox is ex
pected here sometime this month.
Before taking permanent residence
in Amarillo, Mr. Parker, it is said
here, will return to Topeka for a few
days.
Today's appointments practically
write "finis" to the shakeup caused
j by the death of Mr. Kouns.
VICTORY CREDIT TO T.R.
ioosevelt tarried Trogressive of
Maine Into . O. P. Camp.
New York, Sept. 12. Credit for the
Republican victory in Maine is de
posited on the broad shoulders of
Theodore Roosevelt by the Times, a
leading New York Democrat paper.
A Times editorial today comments as
follows: . . j
"It is plain that Roosevelt carried
most of the Progressives with him into
the Republican camp. It appears
probable, too. that more of the new
voters, supported the Republican than
the Democratic candidates. . . . The
vote in Maine does not decide presi
dential elections, and save in landslide
years is no great indication of their
decision. Such comfort as this elec
tion does give, however, is Republican
comfort. It remains to be seen wheth
er in other states the Progressives will
return as generally as they did in
Maine, or whether as in 1876. 1880 and
1884 and 1908, Maine has merely
shown that she was out of step with
the nation."
Shows Party Reunited.
Sun (Republican ,"The returns
indicate that the Republicans and
former Progressives came together in
a wave that closed over the Demo
cratic hopes of a 'September victory.
The vote shows the Republican party
in Maine . . . was reunited yester
day smoothly and solidly. . . . The
Democrats have been asking what the
Republicans were going to do. The
answer has come."

gated between 75,000 and $100,000,
and deaths of three persons were
claimed to have been due to the
failure, were the principal reasons
for my denial of the parole," Governor
Capper said today. "I do not believe
the public would approve the parole,
nor do I believe the spirit of the
parole system would be observed by
releasing the man. Merely because a
man has influential friends does not)
lessen the enormity of his offense, and
I do not believe it would be good pub
lic policy to give Flack his freedom at
this time."
Flack has served a little more than
three years in prison.

On the fare of returns from f3 per

cans m;irt a clean sweep.

plurality which will probably reach
10.000 over Senator Charles F. Johnson
(lieinocrat) for the long term tn the
senate.
Bert M. Fernald (Republican) will
probably have a plurality over Ken.
iieth C. M. Kills of i:s,0U0 for the abort

elected governor by 13.000.
All four Kepubltcan congreaalonal

Big-gent vote recorded In Maine's po
litical history for 3rt vpara, running
considerably above 14fl,000.
Republican majority less than Re
publican bad hoiied.
Augusta. Me., Sept. 12. Maine was
back In the Republican fold today
with what on- the face of return
from 93 per cent of her voting; pre
cincts showed a Republican majority
of about 12,000 in yesterday's election.
The Republicans were apparently
completely victorious in gubernatorial,
senatorial and congressional tickets.
But whether or not Maine's vote can
be taken as "pointing the way" to
what will happen tn November was a
disputed point among politicians to
day because the Republican majority
was not nearly what it used to be in
the old days of Frye and Hale and
this, despite the fact that the total
vote probably wMl be the largest ever
recorded in the Pine Tree state.
The Republicans were jubilant he
cause the Issues .f the campaign were
almost exclusively national and be
cause Senator Charles F. Johnson,
running on his record as a Wilson
Democrat and supported by the entire
strength of the Democratic adminis
tration, was defeated by a progressive
prodigal who returned to the Q. O. P.
fold Frederick Hale, son of former
Senator Eugene Hale. They found ad
ditional satisfaction In the unexpected
indications that a Republican apparent
ly defeated "Dan Mack" Congressman
Daniel McCiillicuddy in the Second
district where twenty-four hours ago
they were almost admitting lack of
hope of turning out one of the most
popular representatives In Maine.
Former G. O. P. Majority 25.000.
The Democrats, on the other hand,,
point to the fact that Maine formerly
was Republican by 25.000. Governor
Oakley Curtis, in a statement at Port
land admitting his own defeat by Carl
E. Milliken, Republican, summed up
the Democratic view when he re
marked: "ft the Republicans don t get a ma
jority of 15.000, Wilson is upheld."
Maine Democrats were pointing; to
day to the fact that they have ma
terially reduced the usual Maine Re
publican majority on national Issues,
and to the figures for 1912 when a
Remihlican plurality of 12.500 in Sep
tember did not point the way to elec
tion of Grover Cleveland In Novem
ber. Summarised from the latest fig
ures obtainable today the Maine vote
was as follows:
