London, Sept. 12. Under the cap

"Suddenly the veil is lifted and the
true state of affairs is disclosed in the
latest German newspapers. They ad-
W.it defeat, at Verdun and describe it
not only as a military, but also as a
moral, defeat, 'the percussion of which

the Balkans.'. They clamor for peace
and renounce any ambition of annex
ation. A veritable disease of truth
telling has broken out among them."
The newspaper cites the Berlin Post
as follows: "Falkenhayn's recall is an
admission of defeat suffered before
Verdun."
The Berlin Vorwaerts is quoted as
saying: "A truce with England must

AUSTRIA -WILL STAY IN
Vienna, Sept. 11 (via Berlin to Lon
don). In a thoroughly frank manner,
the Austro-Hungarian minister of
foreign affairs, Baron Stephen Burian
Von Rajecz, discussed in an interview
with the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press the position of, the duel
monarchy in the world war, which he
said had been erroneously character
ized by enemies and certain neutrals
as unsatisfactory. -- .
"Austria-Hungary t is far from ly
ing down, as hoped by some," said
the minister in a tone carrying con
viction. . c "It is true we would have
peace with joy but not the sort of
peace our enemies would impose.- So
long as we have to defend ourselves
against those who want to take part
of our territory, we naturally are un
willing to discuss peace; so long we
are determined to hold out and win.
The thought that we are eager for
peace on any terms originates prob
ably in the minds hoping that such
will become the case." -

"In company with Stanley Wash

quarters of Gen. Brussiloff, who re

an hour. The fighting at Verdun, he
said, filled him with admiration for
the soldiers of trance, tor his recent
successes he gave all the credit to the
Russian soldier. Washburn asked the
general if Warsaw would be retaken
this year. He replied:
" 'Yes; why not?' "
"Brussiloff has implicit faith in the
Russian soldier. Last year he re
treated owing to the lack of muni
tions. He is as confident of the ulti
mate result as he is now of Warsaw
being retaken this year."

Seventeen women, arrested by City

The city disgraces - itself when it
