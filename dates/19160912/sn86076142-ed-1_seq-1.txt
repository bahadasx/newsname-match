WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. A dec
laratlon by Sery. Lansing that he
considered information secured by
censors from the mails should be
used only for military purposes, was
believed to forecast Injection of that
Issue into the negotiations with Great
Britain over mail seizures. While no
inquiry has been Bent regarding the
statement In Parliament of David
Lloyd George, the British war min
ister, that information gleaned by the
censors properly could be put to "any
public or national use," Mr. Lansing
said he had read the war secretary's
speech and that the matter might
become a subject of diplomatic negotiations.
The first step probably would be a
request for a definite statement of
the British government's policy re
garding use of information, especially
trade secrets, falling Into the hands
of the censors. Secy. Lansing said
he was studying earefully the retalia
tory legislation passed last week by
