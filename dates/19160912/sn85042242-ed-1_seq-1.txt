and cost of inspection to more than
$300,000, -the largest single paving
contract ever awarded at one time
by any. city in North Dakota.
Some vigorous eleventh hour oppo­
sition developed. Captain I. P. Ba­
ker and 22 other protestants filed ob­
jections to the improvement in Dis­
trict No. 2. Mr. Baker favored delay
until a more general expression of
the desires of the taxpayers could
be secured. He declared the commis­
sion was acting too hastily and with­
out giving due consideration to the
relative merits of the various types
of pavement.
He asked that a representative of
the Commercial club be called to ex­
plain by what authority the citizens'
paving committee was appointed and
why more time had not been given.
Mayor Lucas called attention to the
various legal notices published with­
in the last two weeks. Mr. Baker re­
plied by stating that the matter was
being carried forward with too much
haste.
An effort was made to locate C. L.
Young, president of the Commercial
clubfl He could not be reached and
the incident stopped there.
Commission Awards Contracts.
The commission then proceeded to
award,the contracts as related above.
Commissioner Eattey, chairman of
the commission's paving committee,
submitted the following report:
"From August 29 to September 2,
inclusive, we visited the cities of
Fargo, Moorhead, Winnipeg, Duluth,
Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul,
and inspected pavements in said cit­
ies. We examined every form of
pavement providd for in our specifi­
cations, laid under the varying condi­
tions to be met with in the various
cities named. We examined and drove
over many hundreds of miles of vari­
ous kinds of paving, of ages ranging
from
newly
laid pavements to pave­
ments of 32 years of age.
"The conclusions of this committee
in brief and without going into de­
tails are, that pavements satisfactory
to Bismarck and the traffic conditions
here, as well, as climatic conditions,
can be secured from either of the fol­
lowing materials provided for in our
specifications:
"Sheet asphalt.
"Bitulithic.
"Creosoted wood blocks.
"Vitrified brick.
"We recommend the use of Trini­
dad asphalt only, either in sheet as­
phalt or bitulithic pavements.
"We arc not prepared to recom­
mend the use of concrete, in view of
of the fact that it has been used but
a short time and its permanency is
still to be determined.
"The use of bituminous concrete
does not seem to meet with the fur­
ther approval of a number of the
cities we visited, and while further
investigation might disclose that it
would prove an entirely satisfactory

Commission
Is Making
Headway
New London, Conn., Sept. 11.—With
the border situation set aside tempor­
arily, the American-Mexican joint com­
mission devoted itself today to deter­
mining the extent of the control exer­
cised in Mexico by the de facto gov­
ernment, the information being sup­
plied by the Mexican commisisoners
at the request of the American con­
ferees. It was stated informally that
upon the showing furnished by the
Carranza government rested the pos­
sibility that the Washington govern­
ment would Tevoke its warning to
Americans to stay out of Mexico and
encourage their return to their prop­
erty there.
It was explained that the question
of transportation was vital to the re­
sumption of any industry in Mexico
and to show present conditions, the
Mexican commissioners presented fig­
ures.
The commission will continue this
phase of inquiry tomorrow.
IN
STRUMA REGION
No Spectacular Features in Var­
ious War Theatres Yester­
day
ROUMANIANS FOPOB
AUSTRIANS TO RETREAT
London, Sept. 11.—For the first
time in many days, Monday proved a
day without spectacular feature in
some of the various war theatres.
On none of the fronts was a crush­
ing blow delivered by any of the bel­
ligerents and none of the war chan­
cellories reported any great gains by
its armies in the field.
Probably the most significant move
was that of the British in the Struma
region of the GreekMacedonian front.
Here [he E'ritish, after hard fighting,
threw their forces across the Struma
and 'Neohori (Neochari) at the south­
ern end of Lake Tahinos (Lake Tak
inos), which lies between Seres and
Orfano, and at several other places
near the lake. In addition, four vil•
lags were captured and held, notwith­
standing heavy counter attacks by
the Teutonic allies.
From the west of the Vardar river
to Lake Doiran, the French are vio­
lently bombarding Bulgarian posi­
tions, and on the front held by the
Serbians the Bulgarians have been
compelled tb withdraw.
Austrians Are Retreating.
In the Roumanian theatre, the Aus­
trians are in retreat before the Rou­
manians in the Maros and Toplitza
valleys, while to the south of Her
manstadt, the Roumanians have oc­
cupied the village of Helimsar. Vi­
enna admits a further withdrawal of
the Austrian forces near Gyergo.
Heavy fighting continues in Dob
rudja.
On the eastern front, acprding to
Berlin, Russian attacks along the
Stoknod river, northwest of Kovel,
and in Galicia, between the Dniester
and ZIota Lipa rivers, with Halicz
the objective, failed with sanguinary
losses to the Russians.
Except for bombardments and the
repulses of German counter attacks,
Monday was without special incident

Quebec, Ont„ Sept. 11.—With the
loss of eleven lives today, the second
atempt to bridge the St. Lawrence
river resulted in a failure when the
massive center span, weighing 5,100
tons, suddenly collapsed and fell into
into the river. Of the ninety men
caught on the span when it began to
sway, all were rescued, except eleven,
and of these only Wur bodies have
been found.
The span was being raised from
pontoons and was above fifteen feet
of water, when from some unknown
cause it collapsed and sank into the
river, which is 200 feet deep at this
place.
The St. Lawrence river was filled
with many boats at the time of the

Expected 70,000 Workmen of
Other Trades Will Strike
Very Shortly
New York, Sept. 11.—With surface
car transit virtually at a standstill
in Manhattan, the Bronx and part of
Westchester county, and with sub­
way and elevated facilities affected
more than at any time since the In
terborough Rapid Transit strike was
called last Thursday, the traction sit­
uation in .New York tonight assumed
a more serious aspect.
Labor leaders held conferences dur­
ing the day on the question of seek­
ing a sympathetic strike among other
craft, which, if successful, would call
out 750,000 workers in the Metropoli­
tan district, but it was admitted that
no definite action could be expected
for at least a week. The first dem­
onstration of a sympathetic strike
came today, when union teamsters
employed by two brick-making con­
cerns quit their posts rather than
haul sand to the 'New York Railway
company power houses.
Hugh 'Frayne, an organized of the
American Federation of 'Labor, to­
night predicted that a sympathetic
striffe would be called within a week
among several trades closely affiliat­
ed with the operation of traction
lines, numbering approximately 70,
000 men.
These would include longshoremen,
powerhouse employes, teamsters and
stationery engineers and firemen, he
asserted. Action by international offi­
cers of these organizations would be
necessary before a vote could be call­
ed, Mr. Frayne said.
Considerable Disorder,
Disorder occured at several points
today, and arrests were frequent. One
serious demonstration occurred when
strikers piled cobblestones on the
track, stopping a surface car, which
they stoned. A woman passenger was
stunned when she was knocked down
by the rush to get off the car. The
striers lifted the motorman and con­
ductor to their shoulders and started
to their hall with them, but policemen
rescued the men and they ran the car
into the barns.
The traveling public suffered more
inconvenience today than at any time
since the strike started.
With surface traffic virtually par­
alyzed, great throngs went to the sub­
way. Several women fainted in the
crush.
FIRST CASE FOR
SEPT. TERM CALLED
The first case for the September
session of county court was called
yesterday and continued throughout
the day. The case was that of Simon
Shellburg against the Bismarck bank
and the bank at Wilton, on a question
of ownership of valuable certificates,

ing. The case was adjourned last
evening, subject to call. There is no
case on call in court today.

accident, and on the hills along the
shore were hundreds of persons who
came by rail and automobiles to see
the culmination of the mighty engi­

was taken in tow to the gap which it
was expected to fill.
Shortly after eight o'clock the pon­
toons reached the allotted place and
were withdrawn by tugs, leaving the
massive girder resting on hydraulic
jacks.
These had begun to raise the big
span, while the crowds shouted, think
they had seen the most impressive
ceremony of the bridge raising. The
spectators began to leave when sud-.
denly there was a roar of breaking
steel and the span dived into the wat­
er.

Portland, Me.,.Sept. 11.—At 10:30
o'clock tonight, the indications, based
on a calculation of the vote from a
little more than half the precincts
were that the Republicans had won
the state election today by safe plur­
alities.
If the ratio of the Republican mar­
gin is maintained, Carl Milliken will
be elected governor by about 11,000
plurality. Bert M. Fornald, Republi­
can, seems to have been elected for
the short term in the United States
senate, and the same ratio of gain
would give him a plurality of 9,500.
United States Senator Charles H.
Johnson, Democrat, apparently has
been defeated by Frederick E. Hale
by an indicated plurality of 7,500.

didates hold the lead they had at the

been defeated in the Second district
by Wallace H. White, but. the light
was close.
Record Vote Cast.
The total vote may prove to havo
been the largest, ever cast in the state.
Progressives Vote Republican.
The election was the culmination of
one of the hottest fights ever waged
in the state and marked the reunion
of the Republican and Progressive
parties, whose differences in 1912 gave
the electoral vote of Maine to Presi­
dent Wilson, and two years later re­
sulted in the election of Oakley C.
Curtis, a Democrat, by a plurality of
3,189. Tonight's figures indicate that
the larger percentage of the Progres­
sive vote, which two years ago was
18,226, was cast today for the Republi­
can ticket.
Throughout the campaign came
many noted men from over the coun
try there were Republican, Democrat­
ic and Progressive speakers who parti­
cipated and the national issues were
kept to the front. The interest arous
ed, together with perfect election
weather, brought out one of the big­
gest votes ever cast in the stato and
possibly greater than has been known
before.
For the first time the two United
States senators were elected by popu
lar vote and the Republicans made a
determined effort to win the one seat
in the United States senate and the
single seat in the house of represent­
atives held by Maine Democrats. The
Democrats had claimed the state by
3,000 and the Republicans by 15,000,
With all but 90 of the 635 precincts
in the state reported, returns give for
Governor Milliken, 71,301 Curtiss,
Democrat, 51,003.
For United States senator, these pre­
cincts gave Fernald, Republican, 70,
793 Hale, Republican, 69,780 John­
son, Democratc, 62,409 Sills, Demo­
crat, 61,302.
The same precincts in 1914 gave
Haines, Republican, 51,347: Curtis,
Democrat, 56,345 Gardner, Progres­
sive, 16,282.
REPUBLICAN LEADERS
ARE GREATLY ELATED
New York, Sept. 11.—Leaders at
National Republican headquarters
here tonight expressed elation over to­
day's result in Maine. Secretary Rey­
nolds, of the Republican National
committee, issued a statement in
which he said:
"The result in Maine, especially in
the Republican vote for governor,
shows an absolutely reunited party.
Carl E. Milliken has received all the
votes cast for the Progressive candi­
date two years, together with the
'stay-at-home' vote of two years ago.
"Best of all, the state the has re­
pudiated Senator Charles iF. Johnson,
a member of the finance committee of
the senate, which framed the present
Democratic tariff bill."
Leaders at Democratic headquar­
ters. in the absence of reports from
the Maine state leaders, declined to is­
sue a statement.

It will be the biggest on record, of
653 officers, 13,410 enlisted men and
5,750 animals taking part.
For the first time, motor transpor­

Special Train En Route to Suff­
rage States to Stop Off at
Capital City October 9
SUFFRAGE, HOWEVER, IS
NOT THE ISSUE NOW
Women who have 'been taking un­
usual interest in the campaign of
Charles Evan Hughes as a part of the
Hughes Alliance will appear in Bis­
marck, October 9, in the interests of
his candidacy. Mrs. Gertrude Duncan
of New York, special representative
of the National Hughes Alliance, lias
been in Bismarck since Saturday
evening, arranging for the meeting.
It is hoped to have a large public
gathering in the evening, preceded by
a reception to the visiting ladies, all
of whom are of national prominence
in club or general social welfare
work.
Mrs. Duncan stated that, this fea­
ture of the campaign has no connec­
tion with a suffrage propaganda, al­
though many of the women in the
party believe in the principle and
have taken a deep interest in that
issue.
Special Train.
This feature will be one of the
most, interesting and most unique in
the campaign and will give voters of
Bismarck an opportunity to meet and
hear some of the most prominent
women in the feminist movement.
Details for the Bismarck meeting
will be worked out within the next
few weeks.
Fifteen women speakers, and other
women prominent nationally, will be
aboard a special Republican national
committee train that, will visit Bis­
marck October 9, for an eight-hour
stay. It will also stop at Jamestown
and Fargo.
Leaving New York City October 1,
swing up to Boston, and thence back
by way of Buffalo, Detroit and to
Chicago, the party will arrive in the
twin cities October 7, spending two
days in St. Paul and Minneapolis.
Only Brief Stop.
The present itinerary provides a
stay in Fargo of only twenty minutes,
from 7:30 to 7:50 o'clock in the morn­
ing. A fifteen minutes stay is pro­
vided for at Jamestown, while the
schedule calls for a stay of over eight
hours at Bismarck.
The train is sent out under the di­
rection of the Republican national
committee. The National Hughes Al­
liance, with which the women's com­
mittee is associated, mans the special,
which is given over entirely to the
women.
The National Hughes Alliance, Mrs.
Duncan explains, has been in exist­
ence ten years, its first work being
in connection with the election of Mr.
Hughes to the governorship of New
Yoik. When he was nominated for
president, the organization was re­
vived.
The Speakers.
Among the prominent women speak­
ers who will be aboard the train are
the following:
Dr. Katharine Davis, commissioner
of corrections. New York city.
Ella Flagg Young, former superin­
tendent of Chicago schools.
Mary McDonald, head of the Uni­
versity Settlement. Chicago.
Mary Antin, author of "The Prom­
ised Land."

REPUBLICANS ARE
ATTACKED IN SPEECH
Minot, N. D., Sept. 11.—A determin­
ed drive for Progressive votes was
waged northwestward through North
Dakota today by the Prohibition coast
to-coast campaign speakers.
Taking their cue from J. Frank Han*
ly, Prohibition candidate for president,
who declared that the Progressives
could expect no favors from the Re­
publicans if Hughes were elected, all
of the remaining speakers gave added
reasons for Progressives turning Pro­
hibitionists.
Dr. Ira Landreth, the vice presiden­
tial nominee, declared that the Prohi­
bition platform embraced all of the
good Progressive issue. Virgil Hin
shaw, the party's national chairman,
read a letter at every meeting from
Victor Murdock, of Kansas, former
chairman of the Progressive national
committee, declaring that the Repub
licans and Democrats were without an
issue this year.
"It is as certain as the coming of
the night after the day," Mr. Hanly
said: "that the Progressives who vot­
ed for Mr. Hughes and helped him to
victory would find themselves left out­
side the councils of the administra­
tion and in the predicament of men
who had left the party four years be­
fore, because of the dictation, brutal
methods and sordid concepts of these
in control of the party's councils and
affairs, and had then turned about and
restored them again to power and
authority. These men are still un­
repentant standpatters. They care
not a fig for Progressive principles or
Progressives. They are appealing for
Progressive votes now only as a lift
to place and power and these once ob­
tained, the old ideals, practices and
purposes which discredited the Taft
administration will actuate them
again. The leopard cannot change his
spots. He may paint or gloss them
over, but he cannot change them."

This brings to a close a vigorous at*
tempt on the part of New Rockford
to initiate capital removal through In­
voking the initiative feature of the
state constitution as It applies to
amending the constitution Itself. For
nearly two years New Rockford has
been attempting to create sentiment
for capital removal. It cropped out
at the last session of the legislature
when amendments to the constitution
were introduced providing for a
a change in the seat of government
from Bismarck to New Rockford. That
movement failed ignominously, the
concurrent resolution being put to
sleep in the senate.
Following the adjournment of the
legislature, several New Rockford citi­
zens, backed by influential land own*
ers in that section of the state, launch­
ed the Capital Removal association
and with considerable money at Its
command began a vigorous publicity
campaign and a systematic canvasd
for signers to petitions to initiate cap*
ital removal.
Files Petitions.
Secretary of State Hall ruled that
enough signatures had been filed with
him. Upon this decision, attorneys
were employed by the citizen's com­
mittee and the action started which!
resulted in yesterday's decision.
Expressions of satisfaction werei
heard from all sides at the decision
which eliminates from the approach­
ing campaign a contest that would
have stirred up a bitter sectional
fight and which, if successful, would
have resulted in placing wheels under
every institution In the state.
Under the decision. Secretary of
State Hall is permanently restrained
from putting the capital removal
amendment upon the ballot with other
issues to be voted upon In November.
Justice Goss has discussed the Is­
sues involved from every angle and he
reached the conclusion that the legis­
lature never intended this clause of
the constitution to be self-executing.
The opinion follows In part:
"This court issued an order to showt
cause why it should not issue an origi­
nal writ of injunction to stay farther
proceedings in capital removal Insti­
tuted by the filing with the secretary
of state of a petition for submission
of a proposed amendment to Sec. 215
of the state constitution. Relator as­
serts among other things that the sec­
ond subdivision of Sec. 202, of our
state constitution puporting to author­
ize initiative and referendum amend­
ment thereof is not self-executing and
therefore that said petlitoa Is void
and that submission of any proposW
tion thereunder should be enjoined.

serts that this court Is without Juris­
diction or power to Interfere with his
official action, asserting that when so
