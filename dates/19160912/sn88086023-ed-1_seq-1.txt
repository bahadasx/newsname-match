bit the dust yesterday at the expense

Even old Sharkey, the famous Bel-j
grade bucking bull, took delight in
piling a couple of boys for the bene-;
fit of the crowd of interested spectu-:
tors who flocked to the park to watch1
the performance.
The cowboys who braved the at-j
tempt to ride the norses yesterday
declare that the horses without ex-j
ceptlon are in better condition this,
year than ever. With a ten days i
workout their bucking ability should
be of the best variety.
Among the better known horses
who were trotted out yesterday were
lzee. Snake and Nut Cracker. Snake
and Iz.ee piled their riders in good
fashion although the cowboys put up
a good ride. There will be no tryouts
today.

FIGHTING STEER TO BE
AT HAPPY CANYON AGAIN
Committee selects Wildest of Round
I'p Ijonghorin to Furnish Excite
ment During Evening.
The steer fight, which proved such
an exciting climax to past Happy
Canyon programs, will be retained as
a feature of the program Oils year.
Members of the committee yesterday

Up corrals and selected from the'
herd of Mexican long-horns the ani-1
mal who is to give the cowboys some I
practice In dodging.
The steer in question is one of the,
mo.-t beautiful steers ever brought to '
Pendleton. It is a spotted animal
with long horns, curving back, lithe

Indicates Its spirit. It was selected
after half a doien of the wildest of :
the Round-I'p herd had been tried,
out In separate corrals to test their
fighting spirit.
The danger to spectators will be'
eliminated this year inasmuch as It I
will not be necessary to turn any of i

take all risks, but the Ulreoton
thought that such a meritorious at-!

the chances of failure The main
crowd is not here by Tuesday and
there is so much going on during the

that a big crowd could not be drawn
