Washington, Sept. 12. Commenting
a the Maine election today, Secretary
Daniels claimed the result was a dem
jratic victory and that when national
'tsues were in consideration the pro
Jresgfves voted with the democrats.
"This is shown," said the secretary,
by the fart that Milliken. the repub
a candidate for governor, got
",000 votes and the two republican
candidates for senator each got about
c00 less. There is nothing discourag
es in the result. If the democrats had
Juried Maine that would have ended
u entire campaign.
".Maine ought to have about 50,000
"Publican majority. Instead we cut
"town to less than 15,000. The result
a democratic victory."
Mr. Daniels declared it was to be ex

Wilcox and McCormick Predict.
New York, Sept. 12. Statements re
garding the Maine elections were is
sued here today by William R. Willcox
and Vance C. McCormick, republican ,
and democratic chaimen, both speak
ing optimistically of the probable re
sult of the November elections.
"The result in Maine proves that we
are reunited, and that, of course.

Willcox. "The Washington adminis-1

verdict is unmistakable."
Mr. McCormick, who will leave to

Vice President Marshall in Indianapo

"It seems to me that when a candi
date for United States senatorial hon

the result of the Maine election today,
I). Leigh Colvin, executive secretary
of the prohibition national commit
tee, said :
"The outstanding feature was the
sweeping victory of the prohibition
issuo which was paramount in the
Maine election. Carl E. Milliken's
election as governor may be attribu
ted largely to the strong prohibition
sentiment. He made his campaign on
the issue of strict prohibition law en
forcement." THE WAR TODAY
The heary attacks made by the
Anglo-French forces, which netted
them important pains along the
Somme front in northern France
last week, have been suspended.
o important infantry operations
are chronicled today.
In Macedonia the Unitarians are
reported to hae evacuated the
forts at Karala. Guns of allied
warships now dominate Kerala,
rendering the forts useless to the
Bulgarians, who are said to ha?e
turned them orer to the Greeks.
Probably the most slgnlticant
more in the European war the
atres esterday was that of the
British in the Struma region of
the Greek Macedonian front, who
after hard fighting- threw their
forces across the Struma at
eochari at the southern end of
Lake Tahinas. In addition four
1 Blares were captured and held.
Whether this British offensive
means the commencement of a
driie through Bulgaria or is
merely a maneuyer to throw the
British line near fcarala, has not
et been made apparent.

AFTER PEACE
GERMANY IS
NOT WORRIED
Prospect of War-After-War
Causes No Anxiety on
, Trade Relations.
PROBLEMS TO SOLVE
Director of North German
Line Sees Great Demand
for Raw Materials.
Berlin, Monday, Sept. 11 (via
London, Sept. 12.) The prospect
of a "war after the war,"' as pro
posed by British newspapers and
discussed at the economic confer
ence of the allies at Paris, appar
ently is causing; little anxiety in
Germany, where the belief is ex
pressed" that natural commercial
tendencies "ill soon overcome any
artitieial barriers which may be
erected.
This view was voiced in a statement
to the Associated Press today by Phil
lip Heineken, director of the North
German Lloyd Steamship line. Herr
Heineken discussed plans being made
in Germany to resume international
trade after the coming of peace and
said there was no basis for apprehen
sion that Germany might unload low
priced goods on the American market.
Like all German shipping exports,
Herr Heineken looks forward to an
immense call for tonnage with the
ending of the war. All Europe, he
said, will be calling for raw materials
to replenish exhausted stocks.
"Post-bellum traffic," said Herr
Heineken, "will, of course, , be largely

not counterbalance the cotton, tobacco,
copper and other raw materials which
will be imported immediately from
America. Only after the arrival of
these raw materials and the reconver
sion of our industries to a peace ba
sis will cargoes of manufactured arti
cles be available."
Countries Mutually Dependent.
Like most other German business
men, Herr Heineken felt that the pro
posed "war after the war" would have
no greatly injurious effect on the fu
ture of Germany shipping lines. Eng
land, he declared, is too dependent on
Germany for certain articles, and Ger
many in turn can supply herself in
some ways with too much advantage
from England to permit of the per
manent supplanting of natural and
mutually advantageous relations.
Then, too, he added, the proponents of
a post-bellum economic war forget 1 is navigable five months of the year,

continued, the North German Lloyd

before the war. regardless of whether nation gulf. There is workable coal
the steamships captured in hostile
harbors were recovered. New con
struction during the war just about
balances the tonnage destroyed or

Herr Heineken prophesied that the
building of a second isthmian canal
by the United States would not be an
improbable development of the none
too distant future. He fears that the
Panama canal may prove too unrelia
ble a route to permit the United States
to base thereon Its entire international
and naval policy.
ANOTHER U-BOAT
SOON TO ARRIVE
Asked When the Bremen Would Reach
America Director Heineken Said,
"Only the Gods Know."
Berlin. Sept, 11, (via London, Sept.
12, 9:30 a. m.) Reports from Bremen
say that another merchant submarine
is expected to leave that port for the
United States at the end of this month.
None of the projected sister ships to
the Deutschland and Bremen has,
however, been completed, accord
ing to Philip Heineken, one of the di
rectors of the Ocean Navigation com
pany, owners of the Deutschland.
Asked when the Bremen was ex
pected to arrive 1n America, Director
Heineken said: "Only the gods know."
and refused to discuss the matter fur
ther. Director Arthur von Gwinner of the
Deutsche bank, will be elected to the
board of directors of the Hamburg
American Steamship line at a meeting
of the board Sept. 28. The Deutsche
bank Is already represented on the
board of the North German Lloyd line.
Von Gwinner's election to the Hamburg-American
board is in line with
the arrangement for community of in
terests effected between the two lines
shortly before the war.

EXPLORERS FIND
MUCH ON JAUNT
Members of Canadian Arctic Party Re
port Locating New Species In
Far North.
Seattle, Wash., Sept. 1?. Well satis
fied with their work, the seven mem
bers of the party of Dr. Rudolph M.
Anderson, commander of the southern
branch of the Stefansson Canadian ex
pedition into the far north, will leave
Seattle, where they arrived 5-esterday,
for Ottawa In a few days, to make re-
I - - J
interesting discoveries, including find
ings of great quantities of copper, new
species of small mammals and perhaps
new species of flowers.
Stefansson, it was reported, was be
lieved to be continuing his explora
tions north of Prince Patrick Island.
Discussing today the work of his
party. Dr. Anderson said:
"We found on Coronation gulf and
Bathurst inlet vast deposits of copper
of low grade. We were not equipped
to undertake mining operations, but
upon the sides of the cliffs we could
measure the depth of successive flows
of amygaloidal lava containing nug
gets of copper. An Eskimo brought to
us a lump of copper weighing 40
pounds. The ore has many of the
characteristics of Lake Superior cop
per rock. It Is near navigable water.
It would be feasible to construct a rail
road from the Mackenzie river, which
transportation of the ore to the inter
ior of Canada by way of the Mackenzie
river.
"Our headquarters were on the south
side of Dolphin and Union straits
within 10 miles of Franklin bay, on
the Arctic.
"The Eskimos east of the Mackenzie
are abandoning their copper and stone
weapons and buying guns whenever
they get a chance. There are no Eski
mos on Banks island except during the
summer, when they go to the island to
hunt Polar bears, which are abundant
on the island, but not on the mainland.
Caribou are plentiful on all the large
islands. Walrus are seldom found on
the shore of the mainland, but are
abundant on Banks and other islands.
There is no salmon run in the Mac
kenzie and other Arctic rivers, but
large trout are abundant. All the fresh
water lakes in the north are well
stocked with lake trout.
"We probably have discovered a
number of new species of small mam
mals and we shall find out about that
when the skins and skeletons are ex
amined at Ottawa."
Dr. Anderson's home is In Des
Moines, Iowa.

PROTEST ACTIONS
BRITISH PATROLS
Tropedo Boat Invades Territorial Wa
ters of Philippines In Search
for Man.
Washington, Sept. 12. Violation of
American neutrality by a British tor
pedo boat which held up and exam
ined the Philippine steamer Cebu with
in the territorial waters of the Phil
ippines was reported to the war de
partment today by Governor General
Harrison.
The dispatch immediately was trans
mitted to the state department and will
be made the subject of a vigorous pro
test to Great Britain.
The incident occurred yesterday one
mile and a half off Carabao island. Ac
cording to the report of the steamer's
master, Lieutenant Bailes, command
ing H. M. S. destroyer No. 2, boarded
the Cebu, made inquires about her pas
sengers and took both the ship's mani
fest and her passenger list. Appar
ently the officer was searching for a
man named Bady, who was not found.
On releasing the Cebu, the lieuten
ant made this note on her log:
"Boarded at 3:50 a. m., 9-11-16, ex
amined and passed."
There have been many complaints
about the activity of the British vessels
around the Philippines, and while Gov
ernor General Harrison's report fur
nishes the basis for a specific protest,
it is probable that Great Britain will
be called upon to restrict the opera
tions of her patrolling squadron gen
erally in and near the territorial wa
ters of the islands.

CLUB WOMEN IN
PROBE ON BREAD
Chicago Inquiry Regarding "Staff of
Life" Being Made From Several
Angles.
Chicago, Sept. 12. Chicago club
women today planned an inquiry of
their own into the proposed high cost
of loaves of bread, making the fourth
agency thus far engaged locally in the
investigation of the subject. The
others agy?f ferfprai authorities, the
state's attorney's office and the in
spection and weights department of
the municipal government.
Miss Florence King, president of the
Women's Association of Commerce,
sent out letters to the most prominent
bakers and to the heads of firms sup
plying them with materials inviting
them to a meeting next Friday where
the subject will be discussed.
United States District Attorney
Clyne planned to have before him
some of the biggest bakers in Chicago
to find out the real reason for the in
crease. Morris Eller issued a warning that
prosecutions would be commenced
against baking firms who fail to ob
serve the city ordinances against short
weights. He claimed to have found
more than a score of violations yes
terday.
Assertions that bread is the only
food product that has not advanced in
price within the last twenty-five years
were made by bread manufacturers to
Joseph B. Fleming, assistant United
States district attorney today. Mr,
Fleming is investigating the threat to
advance the price of bread from five
to six cents a loaf.
Unless the price was raised, they
said, many of the small baking con
cerns would become bankrupt.
"They all tell the same story," Mr.
Fleming said. "Materials, especially
flour, have gone up in price; but the
price of bread remains the same and
the size of the loaves has been sub
stantially the same for years."
Took Gold for Paper Money.
Berlin, Sept. 12. (by wireless to
Sayville.) "A Roman Catholic priest,
who is a citizen of the United States,
says he witnessed an incident which
occurred when the British took the
Scandinavian-American line steam
ship Frederik VIII, into Kirkwall
early in August," says the Overseas
News Agency. "The priest, who was a
passenger on the steamship, saw the
British take from another passenger,
who also is an American citizen, $10,
000 in gold, giving him paper money
in place of it."
