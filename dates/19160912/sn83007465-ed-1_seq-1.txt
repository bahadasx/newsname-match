D Greenwood Royally Entertained
| State Junior Order Meetin.
Many Lancaster Delegates.
Mr. Editor: Having returned
I from the State Council of the Junior
| Order I will give to the readers of
I the News a short sketch of the proI
ceedings of same. The writpr of this
| article boarded the train at the city
I of Lancaster Thursday morning for
I the city of Greenwood in company
with a large number of the other
boys previously mentioned in the
News. We arrived at Greenwood
about 2:30 o'clock p. m. After registering
and taking lunch, a number
of us took a Btroll to the Connie
Maxwell Orpihanage one mile from
the city, on arriving, Mr. Jamison,
the superintendent, took charge of
us and for one hour's time explained |
to us the different departments of
the institution which consists of six
hundred and fifty acres of land and
twenty-six modern buildings, with
each department well furnished. One|
of thefetriking scenes is a sanatorium
well furnished. At this building we!
found three children whoee conditions
were sad, but they 6eemed to
be cheerful and well cared for. At j
this home there is three hundred
bright boys and girls who seem to
be happy and cheerful. This home
is something that the State ought
to be proud of. Mr. Jamison told
us that the property was valued at
three hundred thousand dollars and
that it had not received one cent of i
State aid. 1 haven't told half about
the orphans home as it would make'
this article too long.
We will now return to the city of
Greenwood and take supper and meet
the first session of the State Council
at 8 o'clock. The hour having ar-1
rived, we found the large court
house crowded to hear the welcome
addresses from the different orders.!
The presiding officer was H. C. Tillman,
Esq. The following addresses
of welcome were made: In behalf of I
the I. O. O. F. and W. O. W., K.
Baker; in behalf of the Elks, by T.
S. Evans; in behalf of the Juniors
by Rev. G. W. Bussey; in behalf of,
the T. O. R. M. by O. Oi Smith; in
behalf of the City of Greenwood by !
H. C. Tillman. I do not know
whether he is a son of B. R. Tillman
or not, but he is a splendid orator.
He delivered to "us the city of Greenwood
to do with as we pleased. He!
said in part: "If you see anything
you want Just take it, if there is anything
you want and don't see it just
ask for It and you shall have it. Ifl
any of you young men want any of
the fair ladies for a wife you can j
have her (provided she says so) and
we will furnish the preacher to
marry you." And by the way I will
nsrf right here that I left my friend
driest there, and he may bring one
bafek with hkm. The following responded
to the addresses of welcome.
R. Atmer Smith of Charleston, S. C.;
C. B. Webb of North Carolina. National
Councilor, and John Noyes of
New Hampshire, National Vlce-Chanollor.
I wisn every Junior in America
could have heard Brother Noy?s*
address on the Immigration Question.
He said we Americans treated the
immigrants, the dirty cut-throats
and sneaks of the old world, better
than we do our own native horn
sons. Why, because we have a law
on our statue that demands that our
boys shall be twenty-one years of
age before they can go to the ballot
box and vote, and yet we will permit
the immigrants of the old world to
come In and In two years let him
walk up to the polls and vote to make
laws with which to govern us, when,
as a matter of fact, he has no interest
In our government whatsoever.
He said the Immigration bill, now
pending in congress, was as sure to
pass as the sun rises in the east He
Mild he would not he aatlafled uritll
ccnjcresR enacted a law to make those
that could stand the teat remain hero
twenty-one yeara before he would he
allowed to vote. He apoke In high
terniH of all the aenatora and congressmen
from South Carolina aa beIn*
In favor of the Immigration bill.
He pralaed Ed Smith in the highest
terma. Speaking being over, the
Council then went Into secret session.

CALLS FOR CALMNESS
If Both Parties Can Keep Quiet

Athens, Sept. 9 (via London
Sept, 11.)?"If the entente and antiVeneizelist
factions can only keey
quiet for 10 days and not embroil
the situation Greece's entry into the
war will be a settled fact,' said ;i
I prominent Greek official to the Associated
Press today. "If not," h<
said, "it is .the end oi Greece."
King Constantine and Premiei
Zaimis conferred at length today. On
the whole the situation with regard
J to Greece's entry into the war on the
side of the entente seems favorable
j notwithstanding the arrest last SunI
day and Monday by Anglo-French s?eI
cret police of German and Austrian
' ggpntQ apalnat urHinl* PfomJA^ V.?
mis vigorously protested and despiU
I complicity by the French in the disj
attectlon of the Eleventh Greek di
I vision at Saloniki which profoundly
shocked the Greek public and seri
! ously endangered the success of tlx
negotiations then in progress. Tlx
mere suggestion of the possibility ol
King Constantine commanding tlx
allied armies in Macedonia, however
I seems to override every hesitation.
The reported opposition of Russia
and Italy to Greece's co-operation ir
the war is actually much less thar
had been believed, and the Serbs, fai
from objecting. are most anxious
that the Greeks join the entente. Ii
is generally conceded in entente cir
cles that Gen. Sarrail, the French
commander, would be glad of the as
slstance of the Greek soldiers wlu
fought against the Rulgars thre?
years ago. The only menace to tlx
success of the negotiations lies in tlx
Greek government holding out to<
long in the hope of obtaining th<
; concessions offered 18 months agi
but which are no longer to be ob
tained.
Eight classes of untrained reserv
ists between the ages of 33 and 4<
years soon will be called to the col
ors.
Athens is virtually under martia
law. Patriots of infantry and cav
I airy parade the streets and the en
tente legations are under stron*
guards. Fifteen hundred marine!
'have been added to the garrison here
'on account of the uncertainty in re
gard to the attitude of the t.oops
The excitement caused by army dis
affections at Saloniki, however, ii
jdying out.

The juniors of Unity council wll

Present Quotations Are Bringing in

I !
Increasing Rapidly. si
The cotton market has opened
with a brisk trade throughout the pl
1 State, the sharp advance in prices w
' causing a rapid rush of all available
! cotton to the platform. Columbia
1 buyers believe producers will con- II
" tinue to sell just so long as the pres-1
' ent scale of prices prevail. Prices pah. |
lover the State yesterday, according
to quotations of one of the lage pur-!
1 chasing offices in Columbia, ranged
1 from 14-1-2 to 14 3-4 cents.
! [ Another observation of the buyers
was that the farmers, in their zeal to
jtake advantage of the bullish mar'I
net, will jeopardize the possibility or
1 sharp advances in the immediate fu"
ture. Those who expressed an
! opinion were in accord with the mar'Iket
would break decidedly should rent
"iceipts continue to increase in volume
'' as present trading indicates. With
"|a crop two millions or more bales be- jc
1 low that of last year and a greatly (j.
' reduced surplus brought over, the ((
f buyers were emephatic in their. .
f claims that farmeres could command [ ^
much higher prices if early selling,
could be held in ciheck. ^
1 J. Sumter Moore, who deals ?x-|jr
1 elusively in long staple, says he
1 j.ects no more than n half crop of this|rf
fine quality cotton this season. Long;jn
' staple is grown exclusively in th<
t Pee Dee, that portion of the State ^
which suffered severely from the;
If
1 long sustained rainfall two monthsi
ago. The first offerinps are now be}
inp purchased at 20 to 22 1-2 cents ?

/AN WYCK PARTY
DISCUSS_FLOOD RELIEF
\sks for investigation;
'alls for Answer From Mayor,.
Says Money Should He Spent
in Midst of Sufferers.
^lr. Editor:
The destruction wrought by the
oods last July Is an old story to .
orae but to others it is fresh and i
rill live with them for some time.,
o realize what it means to thoBt
ho live along the streams where it
id its total devastation, only needs
visit by the skeptical, to view thw >
mpty barns and cribs and poor tock
for the want of feed, when i
hey would come to the eonrlnsinr.
s the Queen of Sheba In Soloman's?
inie, and say "the half has not been,
aid." When congress was informed,
s to the great destruction caused
y the July Hood, it got busy ami
oted an appropriation for the Hood,
utterers which was apportioned telle
four States that had been so hard
it. This fund was to relieve the
estitute and suffering. Seeds were
ontributed for immediate use. but
nfortunately much of it is not
uitahle for this season, nor what is
eeded by the Hood sufferers. Socqcj
f this seed was distributed in some>
arts of the country about the niidle
of August, and was planted and is
ow growing. Hut how is it Lancaster
county? Some of the sufferers
lade applica.ion for seed as soon
s it was known to be on hand. They
ave not received any yet. I have a.
ersonal knowledge of one case ,
here affidavits were made on Ann
6th and presented for seed, but was;
iformed that the seed could not
e distributed before Monday of the
allowing week and could be hat!
ny day of the week. On Thursday
f the following week, a wagon was*
ent to Lancaster for seed for 26
ood sufferers. The seed were mere,.,
ut no one would distribute theni
'his wagon and team came from a
istanee of fourteen miles. It wasent
back home empty but with the
ssurance that the seed would bc->
orwarded by U. S. franchise mail
y Saturday. This is sixteen days
ince the request for seed and noeed
yet. We must think there, is
ome one derelict in uuty.
Now as to the Relief Flood Fund .
t seems this is being used to build
oads and work streets. The pooi ood
sufferer must work on the road*
r street like a gaily slave at one
ollar per day. Some places where
his work is being done is at a disance
from the home of the Hood
ufferer and for him to get anything
rom this fund he will be compelled
o leave his home and family, per
laps in needy or destitute circum?
tances, and get his dollar a (lay .
vhich will barely pay his expense^or
board and lodging as we know
ucli things come high, especially intown.
The only place the money
s being used in Lancaster county
ar as we know, is on the streets of
.ancaster, which we think is very
injust to the Hood sufferers of Lanaster
county. This may he the way
he government deems best to r< -
ieve the flood suuerer, but in in>
veak judgment I think then? arf
ither ways that a part 01 this monej'
:ould be used that would he a reaL
nd lasting relief to those who sulered
by the destructive floods it*
luly. Along the Catawba river much
>f the land is washed and will not be
it to cultivate for years, while other
daces can he reclaimed and made to'
>oar good crops by opening drains
nd ditches that have been filled up
ij the washing sands and debris, and'
s now covered by water and will *
ave to he abandoned unless this:
itching is done. Some of this land?
as been worked by tenats for standing
rent, others by share cropers and
ome by the owners of the farm
'he destruction hoo ? --
,.cm bo grent
'ith these tenants, eropers and land
wners in the loss of their crops
hat they are not able to hear th?
xpennes of this work. It will take
11 they make and much more to
leet their obligations. Now shall
hese fertile lands along the streams
e abandoned? Would it not be betpr.
for part of the flood fund to be
xpended in this way, than to be put
n the streets of wealthy towns
rtileh did not suffer by the floods*
know what I am talking about,
lo one in Lancaster county suffered.
