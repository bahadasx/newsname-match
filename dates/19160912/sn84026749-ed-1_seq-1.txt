Officials to Enforce
Law Forbidding Use of

The extreme penalty of the law will be demanded in all
cases of automobile accidents resulting from the use of glaring

No driver having a District license can be excused from
failure to obey the regulation. The accident which occurred
on the Beltsville road is ample proof of the absolute necessity
of such an ordinance. Statement by Corporation Counsel
Syme.
Corporation Counsel Syme Declares Extreme Pen

That Near BeltsvilleMaryland
Urged to Co-operate.
Impressed by tho circumstances sur
rounding the automobllo accident near
Beltsville, Md.. on Sunday, In whli'h
Miss Nellie Shoemaker, of 640 F street
southwest, was perhaps fatally Injuied,
Washington police officials today re
iterated their opinion that Maryland
should enforco the law restricting the
use of automobile searchlights, to pre
vent such accidents.
Inspector of Detectives Grant was
most emphatic on the matter.
"Many of the accidents wh'loh have
occurred recently," he said, "wero
caused by motorists turning their
searchlights full in the fare of ap
proaching operators. This practice
blinds the operator of the on-cnnilng
mnchlnc and unless he brings his ve
hicle to an abrupt halt he 's llablo to
leave the roadway and to serious acci
dent. There should be some action on
thlH immediately."

An old man In his eightieth year, who
ran ammunition down the Potomac
river during the civil war and piloted
transports that brought the dead and
wounded of the battle of the Wilder

Department today looking for a Job.
"I've done too much for my country

partment told him all the civilian navy
positions were under the civil service.
JIo Is coming back to see Secretary
Daniels later.
"Whv don't von no to the Soldiers'
Jlome?" one of the naval officers asked
him.
"I'm a sailor man from tip to toe." the
patriarchal Key irplled. "and soldiers
and sailors don't agree."
The veteran brought with him to the
Navy Department his record, as pub
lished by the United States Army and
Navy Historical Association, and
which showed he had been active In
the Union side all during the war
after he escaped from the Confederate
navy Into which he had been con
scripted for three months.
"I've never asked the Government
for anything before." the veteran said
when he came to the Navy Depa.l
ment today. "And now 1 only want
some little Job that will enable me
to keep soul and body together.'
The veteran left the 'a.-y Depart

Whllo the Republicans claimed the

of the Progressive and Republican
parties, the Democrats maintained
that later figures will show that a
large percentage of tho progressives
voted tho Democratic ticket.
Chairman Wlllcox, of the Repub

"I regard tho Maine result as an In
dication of the certainty of election
of Hughes and Fairbanks In Novem

In Maine."
Chairman McCormlck. of the Demo

told tho newspaper men he had "no
sad song to sing." McCormlck said:
"A plurality of approximately only
10,000 In comparison with tho Repub

Indicates that this is a Democratic

that President Wilson Is stronger by
far than the local ticket In Maine, ac
cording to advices which come to me.
"I most certainly do not concede a

that he will get at least 25 per cent of
