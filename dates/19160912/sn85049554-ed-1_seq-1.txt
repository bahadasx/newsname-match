GREECE MUST ENTER
WAR WITHOUT PLEDGE
Might Have Obtained Territorial Con
cessions From Allies at Ono Time,
But May Now Bo Compelled to Fight
Without Promise of Reward—King of
Bulgaria Believed to Have Laid Down
Conditions to Emperor William.
The heavy attacks made by the
Anglo-French forces, which netted
them important gains along the
•Bomme front last week, have been
suspended, the allies being appar
ently contented for the present, at
a
least,
with holding the ground won
•i$? against German counter attacks.
{K- No Important Infantry operations
are recorded today.
i'" In Macedonia, the Bulgarians are
reported to have evacuated the
forts at Kavala, which they occu
pled last month, when they pushed
forward to the Aegean coast. Guns
of the allied warships now dominate
the forts at Kavala.
London dispatches indicate a
growing belief that Greece may
"V shortly be round actively on tiie
ejde of the entente allies in the
Balkan campaign. Should she en
ter the war, she will do so. It is
said, without the guarantees of
territorial'advantages offered In the
past.
London,.Sept. 12.—The political slt
oation in the pear east is of no less in
terest to the European capitals than
the military outlook, and It Is believed
important changes are pending. The
reasons which caused Premier Zalxnlfl
to tender his resignation are not stated,
exoept that he was prevented from
dealing with the external situation. It
Is believed here that he accepted the
premiership on the understanding that
he was-to maintain neutrality.
Should Greece decide to join the ea»
tepte, she'will do so ,it is understood
h«» witlWUt any guarantee as to the
future." There was a time when the
entente was .willing to promise her ter
ritorial concessions, but that time
jiaat. The allies, however, will agree to
place munitions and equipment at her
disposal.
English political writers say that the
purpose of the visit of King Ferdinand
of Bulgaria to Emperor William Is be
lieved to be to lay down conditions un
der which Bulgaria will continue to
fight.
Bulgare 8uffer Heavy Losses.
London, Sept. 12.—The new offensive
oI the entente allies on the Macedonian
front, has resulted in the defeat of the
Bulgarians, says a dispatch from
Athens. The Bulgarians sustained
enormous losses in a battle of thirty
six hours and are retreating.
French troops, co-operating with the
British in the new offensive on the
Struma front, in Greek Macedonia, have
captured a village from the Bulgarians,
It was announced officially today. The
British forces, Which crossed the river,
have seized the Bulgarian trenches on
the east bank.
The following official statement was
given out today:
"Yesterday evening our heavy artil
lery caused two large conflagrations in
the enemy's depot at Grand Court.
There was some hostile artillery activ
ity during the night against our lines
between Delvllle wood and Mouquet
farm. Otherwise there were no devel
opmentc."
RUPPR^CHT IN COMMAND.
Bavarian Crown Prince at Head of Ger
man Armies on Somme Front.
Berlin, .Sept. 12.—Crown Prince ftup
prccht, of Bavaria, has now assumed
the ovef command of the German arm
's les on the Somme front. He is en
trusted With the general direction of
operations against the Anglo-French
offensive. All troops assigned to this
task are placed under his control, mak
ing possible the distribution of reserves
and the employment of all the means
of war to the best advantage under a
unified plan.
The, appointment of Prince Rupp
recht was effective before the latest
visit o* an Associated Press corre
spondent to Bapaume, last week, but
the.news could not be cabled until the
announcement of the official army
headquarters report of today, which
[j1 reveals a general rearrangement of
commands brought about by the ap
pointment of Field Marshal von Hin
denburg as chief of staff. The new
order divides the western front Into
three sectors, and assigns these to
three princely commanders, who, re
gardless of reasons of policy which
dictated their appointment to com
mand of armies at the beginning of
the war, have won their spurs by suc
cessful conduct of operations. They
are regarded here not as figureheads
ut as generals of distinction and
bility.
Conditions among German prisoners
of war interned in Switzerland are
satisfactory, according to a report
made by Major General Friedrich, who
recently made a visit of Inspection to
the Swiss camps, says, the Overseas
Jews Agency 'oday. The quarters
provided are adequate in all respects
and good care is taken of the men by
the Swiss authorities.

Germany Does Not
Expect Trade War At
Berlin, Sept. 12.—Tile prospect of a
"war after the war" as proposed by
British newspapers and discussed at
the economic conference at Parts is
causing little .anxiety in Germany,
where the belief Is, expressed that
natural conditions will overcome all
artificial barriers which may be erect
ed. This view was expressed today
to the Associated Press by Philip
Heinek£n, director of the North German
Lloyd Steamship line. Herr Heineken
discussed plans to be made In Ger
many to resume international trade af
ter the coming of peace and said there
was no basis for apprehension that
Germany might unload low priced
goods on the American market.
Herr Heineken looks forward to a
call for Immense tonnage at the end
of the war. -Ml Europe, he said, will
be calling for raw materials
As ships which have been requisi
tioned for war purposes can not be
returned Immediately, but will require
considerable alteration, those com
panies which have tonnage available
will be placed at a great advantage.
the Macedonian front, taking the of
fensive against the Bulgarians, nave

ponents, on a front of two miles, to the
depth of about 800 yards. It was an
nounced officially today.

from a «emi-official source that the
Bulgarians have evacuated all the
forts at the Greek seaport of Kavala,
which they occupied last month.

sArf Allied Causer,
Paris. Sept.412. Lloyd-George, the
British war minister, last week deliv
ered a speech in the casemates of the
Verdun cltadeV which moved the de
fenders to tears.
"None of the military feats with
which the French history i«i filled," said
he, "shows more than does the defense
of Verdun the highest qualities of the
French army. This victorious resist
ance will be immortal, because Verdun
not only saved France but our great
common cause and the whole of hu
manity.
"Upon the height surrounding this
old citadel the evil power of the enemy
has been broken like a furious sea
against a granite rock. I am deeply
moved to come in contact with this
sacred soil. In the name of the Brit

With me they bow their heads before
your'sacrifices and glory."
After a dramatic pause, lifting his
glass, he said:

DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR
BEATEN BY 13,800
Republicans Elect Solid Delegation to
Congress and Will Control Both
Houses of State Legislature—Secre
tary Daniels Professes to See Demo­
cratic Victory in Analysis of Returns
—Guardsmen Strongly Republican.
Portland, Maine, Sept. 12.—The
largest vote In the history of Maine
was cast at the state election yes
terday. The total vote will ap
proximate 150,000. In the last
presidential year it fell below 142,
Q00.
The receipt today of the vote
from the border and a fpw isolated
towns increased the plurality of
Carl L. Milliken, republican, for
governor, over Governor Oakley C.
Curtis, democrat, from the indi
cated figures of 13,000 last night, to
13,800. Pluralities for other repub
licans were confirmed in late re
turns. The republicans have a solid
delegation in both branches of con
gress and will easily control the
legislature.
By a vote of about 4 to 1 the
voters approved the state law lim
iting the employment of women
and children to fift^-four hours a
week.
Portland, Maine, Sept. 12. The
thoroughness of the republican victory
at the polls yesterday was emphasized
as the returns from Isolated towns and
vicinities straggled in today. Revised
figures place the plurality of Governor
Elect Carl Milliken, republican, over
Governor Charles E. Curtis, at 13,355.
Returns from the border show that the
members of the Second Maine Infantry
cast a total vote of 470, of which Milli
ken received 300.
Pluralities for the republicans, who
will send a solid delegation to con
grpss, were practically unchanged from
the figures of la»t night, as were the
'pluralities of Frederick Hale and
former Governor Bert Fernald, who
•were elected to the United States
senate.
The republicans, who have held a
majority In the state senate, Will con

majority
Big Republican Victory.
Or. account of it= effect on the presi
dential campaign, both parties concen
trated all their efforts" on the election
in Maine, and the result Is regarded as
a great victory for the republicans.
All the spellbinders of both parties
were thrown into the field, and the
voters have been surfeited with po
litical "dope."
Mr. Hughes put in sledge hammer
blows against President Wilson's pol
icies and was particularly severe in his
criticism of the passage by congress of
the Adamson eight-hour bill at the de
mand of the railroad brotherhoods.
He declared that Wlls'on and the
democratic congress should not have
legislated before an investigation of the
situation.
Some of the more timid of the re
publicans held that Hughes should
have used the soft pedal on the labor
situation, fearing the loss of labor
votes.
The result proves that Mr. Hughes
more correctly Judged the temper of
the people than some of his advisers.
Climax of Hot Fight.
The election was the culmination of
cne of the hottest fights ever waged in
the state, and marked the reunion of
the republican and progressive parties,
whose differences in 1912 gave the
electoral vote of Maine to President
Wilson and two years later resulted in
the election of Governor Oakiey C.
Curtis, a democrat, by a plurality of
3,189.
Make Clean Sweep.
Maine, the first state to sit in Judg
ment on the Wilson administration,
elected a republican governor, two
United Slates aeiiators and four con
gressmen. The republicans thereby
won back the governorship, one seat In
the senate and one in the house, which
*hal fallen into the hands of the demo
crats in 1912. and 1914.
The plurality for Carl E. Milliken,
republican candidate for governor, will
probably total 12,000.
Bert M. Fernald, republican, won the
short term In the senate with a plu
rality nearly as large as that of Milli
ken.
Fx-ederick Hale, son of the late Sen
ator Hale, has defeated United States
Senator Charles F. Johnson by an In
dicated plurality of about 8,000.
One Contest Close,
The republicans barely nosed thru
to victory in the second congressional
district where Congressman Daniel J.
McGlllicuddy was beaten by only about
ajw votes by Wallace H. White.
Louis B. Goodall, in the First dis
trict, Congressman John A. Peters in
the Third and Ira G. Hersey in the
Fourth all won over their democrat op
ponents by pluralities ranging from
2,000 to 4,000.
The vote was probably the largest
ever cast In the state. Political -ob
servers say the republicans showed a
gain of about 35 per cent over the
state to again of about 7 per cent for
the democrats.

MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1916.
Iowa Explorer Tells
of Rich Minerals to
be Found In North
Seattle, Wash., Sept. 12.—Dr. Ru
dolph M. Anderson, of Iowa, who was
commander of the southern branch of
the Stefansson expedition into tho far
north, will leave Seattle, where he ar
rived yesterday with seven men, for
Ottawa In a Tew days to report to the
Canadian government on the results
achieved.
Anderson, who was second in com
mand of the expedition, said thry
would report many interesting discov
eries. Among them, he said, are the
findings of great* quantities of copper,
new species of -small mammals and
perhaps new species of flowers. Stef
ansson, It was reported, was conttfiu
Ing his explorations north of Prince
Patrick Island.
Vast Copper Deposits,
Discussing the work of his party,
Dr. Anderson said:
"We were instructed to survey the
copper deposits already known and
seek new ones. Every explorer from
the earlier times had knnwn that th«
Eskimos had used knives, spear heads
and other utensils hammered from cop
per. We found on Coronation s?ulf
vast deposits of copper of low grade.
We were not equipped to undertake
mining operations, but on the sides of
cliffe we could find great nuggets of
copper. An Eskimo brought us a nug
get of .copper weighing forty pounds.
It is workable from the surface and
is near navigable water.
"It would be feasible to construct a
railroad from the Mackenzie river,
which Is navigable five months of the
.year, to Great Bear Lake, which also
Is navigable much of the year. A
further railroad line could be built
from thrf' lake to the copper field.
There is'workable coal also within ton
miles of Franklin bay, on the Arctlj.
This cool outcrops In ravines, veins
several feet thick being found.
Eskimos Buy Guns.
"The Eskimos east of the Macken
zie are abandoning their copper and
stone weapons and buying guns wher
ever they get a chance. Lately the
Eskimos have been meeting at Great
Bear Lake and trading. Formerly the
Eskimos and Indians avoided each
other. Now the Indians exchange guns
and other articles for fox skins and
musk hides. Caribou are plentiful on
all the large islands. Walrus«^»re sel
dom found on the shore of the main
land, but are abundant on the islands.
There is\no salmon run in the Macken
zie and other lt^rge rivers but large
trout are abtmdant.
"We
probably have discovered a
number of species of small mammals
and we shall find out about that when
the skins and skeletons are examined
at Ottawa."

publican ticket.
Thruout the campaign, in which a
great nuiufcfe'i of men from all parts of
the country-atjd drawn from" republi
cans, democrats'^and progressives alike
participated, national issues were kept
to the fifont. The Interest aroused,
together with perfect blection weather,
brought out one of the largest votes
ever cast in the state and possibly
greater than has ever been known be
fore.
Legislature Now Republican.
For the first time the two United
States senators were elected by popu
lar vote and the republicans made a
determined effort to win the one seat
In the senate and-a single seat in the
house of representatives held by Maine

ed the state by 3,000 and the repub
licans by 15,000 before the election.
"Democratic Victory," Says Daniels,
Washington, Sept. 12.—Commenting
on the Maine election today, Secretary
Daniels claimed the result was a
democratic victory and that when na
tional issues were in consideration the
progressives voted with the democrats.
"This is shown," he said, "by the
fact that Milliken got 77,000 votes and
the two republican candidates for sen
ator each got about 7,000 less.
"Maine ought to have about 50,000
republican majority. Instead, we cut
it down to about 15,000. The result is
h. democratic victory."
Primary Campaign In Illinois.
Chicago, Sept. 12.—The state primary
campaign which closed today was one
of the hardest fought in the history of
Illinois. Chief interest centcrs in the
three-cornered fight between Frank O.
Lowden, Frank L. Smith and Senator

tion for governor. Lowden Is support
ed by the regular organization, Smith
ir running as an independent, and Hull
•*S SUppOFttru by the snti-oixlouu ieu&ue
and other factions.
Former Senator William Lorlmer is
attempting to "come back" by seeking
the^ nomination for congress in the
Sixth district.
On the democratic side chief interest
Is in the fight between Governor Dunne
and W. G. Brinton for the gubernato
r'al nomination.
South Carolina Guardsmen Vote.
El Paso, Tex., Sept. 12.—National
guardsmen of SoJth Carolina stationed

vessels «round the Philippines, and
while Governor General Harrison's re

asked to restrict the operation of her
ships in and near the islands.
In order that there might be no mis
take about where the Cebu was at the
time she was held up, her exact position
was given by the master as follows:
"Latitude 14 degrees, 16 minutes

Quebec, Sept. 12.—The St. Lawrence
Bridge Company and the Quebec
bridge commission are conducting a
joint investigation today into the col
lapse of the central span of the
Quebec cantilever bridge over the St.
Lawrence river while It was 'being
hoisted Into position. The death list
remains at'eleven.
Accounts of survivors of the dis
aster and of spectators are at hopeless
variance, some holding that the span
Itself buckled first, and others that the
hoisting supports did not work uni
formly.
Engineers today said that as aoon as
the cause of the accident is ascer
tained, the work of either constructing
a new span or raising the collapsed
one will be undertaken. It Is esti
mated the work will cost Jl,000,000.
The opening of the bridge, scheduled
for next spring, has been indefinitely

EXPORTS PEiRIL MEAT SUPPLY.
Beef Shipments Lead Increases as
Tjtal Animals Decrease.
New York, Sept. 12.—The European
war Is encroaching seriously upon the
meat supply of this country, accord
ing to figures made public by the for
oign trade department oI the National
City Hank. Notwithstanding tho
marked decrease in the number of
food animals in the United States, ex
ports of meat have trebled since the
beginning of the war and of beef atone
exports are greater by tenfold.
The compilation shows that exports
of meat of all kinds, which amounted
to 445,000,000 pounds In the fiscal year
1314, the year prior to the war,
amounted to RSR.000,000 In 1915 and l.»
339.000,000 pounds In 1916.
The increase of 100 per cent in the
tnt.il
mojit export* during th« flrwt
year of the war and 200 per cent in
the second year Is trifling when com
pared with the gain in beef exports
alone. The quantity of frosh beef ex
ported Jumped from 6,400,000 pounds
In r.iH to 170.000,000 in 1915 and 231,
