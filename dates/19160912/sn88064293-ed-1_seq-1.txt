ST. MARY HELPS OUT
IBERIA PAP1SH FAIR
At a recent meeting of the Police
Jury in St. Mary parish it was decided
by the members of that official body
that the appropriation of the State
which is $250.00 would be donated
to the Teche Fair Association for the
conduct and expense of the Fair to
be held here the latter part of the
month. In other words it will be
practically a joint fair. This under
standing was brought about by the
presence in St. Mary at the meeting
of the Police Jury, of Dr. J. A. flood
win and Secretary Bernard. It is
their intention to also interest the
good people of St. Martinsville to
(join with Iberia and St. Mary and
have one of the biggest attractions j
ever held in the state outside of I
Shreveport. All of the necessary ar- i
rangements are now being made for !
the buildings anil floor space and
