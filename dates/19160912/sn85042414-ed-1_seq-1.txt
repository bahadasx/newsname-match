pathetic strike was called, it probably
would not involve over 60,000 work
ers.

ing, motormen of one elevated road
reported that they were fired upon by
strikers from roofs. A woman pas
senger was struck on the head by a
thrown missle and seriously injured,

halted surface cars and set upon

ter refused to desert their posts.

Princely Commanders—
All Win Spurs.
Berlin, Sept. 12.—(Via London.)—
Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria
has now assumed command of the
German armies on the Somme front.
He is entrusted with the general di
rection of the operations against the
Anglo-French offensive. All the troops
assigned this task are placed under
his control, making possible the dis
tribution of reserves and the employ
ment of all means of the war to the
best advantage under a unified plan.
The appointment of Prince Rup
precht was effective before the latest
visit of the Associated Press corre
spondent to Bapaume last week, but
the news could not be cabled until
the announcement in official army
headquarters was reported today,
which reveals a general arrangement
of commands brought about by the
appointment of Field Marshai von
Hindenberg as chief of staff.
The new order divides the western
front into three sectors and assigns
these to the three princely comman
ders, who, regardless of reasons of
the policy which dictated their ap
pointments to the command of armies
at the beginning of war, have won
their spiys by a successful conduct of
operations.
Duke Albrecht, prospective heir of
the kingdom of Wurtemburg, is com
manding the northern sector. The
German crown prince is over the com
mand of the Verdun sector.

he was studying carefully the retalia
