money he had collected.
Arriving back at bis place of busi
ness he confessed to his immediate
employer to having gambled all of
the day's collections away, and re
ceived a severe rebuke for it.

POLICE ARE AFTER
KALALAU BURGLAR
Within the paot three weeks the
house of a native named Kelau, in
Kalalau valley, was burglarized.
Dried fish, pots and pans and a 32
calibre revolver were taken. The
loss was discovered when the Ha
waiian returned to his house last
Tuesday.
About a year ago a Japanese with
long hair was seen fishing in a
stream in Kalalau valley, not far
from the house of Kelau. Inasmuch
as 'practically all bona lide residents
of the valley are known, the sus
picious of Sheriff Rice were directed
toward this mysterious Japanese.
Moreover, h e suspects that the
prowler may be Kanenioto, a Japa
nese who murdeied his wife at Ma
kaweli three years ago, and disap
peared. .The sheriff detailed live police
men and specials on the case and
they went into Kalalau valley Wed
nesday morning and spent two days
in the search. The valley is so dense
ly wooded and overgrown with shub
bery that it was impossible to see
more than a few feet in any direc
tion. The search was rendered all
the more difficult by rain, which
was almost constant.
Sheriff Rice states that the police
will continue their search as long as
there is any hope of finding the
mysterious Japanese suspect, and
of locating the burglar of the Kelau
home.
