With the British Army In France,
Sept. iO.—Via London, Sept. 11.—The
battle for the ridge between Thlepal
and Ginchy redoubled in furry yester
day afternoon when the British suc
cessfully stormed the right bastion.
German trenches were destroyed
over a four-mile stretch and their gar
risons took refuge In shell holes and
the fortified cellars of the village of
Ginchy. The British troops left their
trenches about 4:30 p. m. The main
attack against Ginchy was entrusted
chiefly to the Irish. The German for
tifications consisted of oellars fitted
with ingenious loopholes for rifles and
machine guns and a mud fort in the
center of a farm which bristled with
machine guns.
The fighting was resperate but the
Irish carried through their first attack
in eight minutes. After half an hour's
pause they again dashed to the assault
and in ten minutes had established
themselves in positions north of the
village.
The right wing advanced more slow
ly east of Ginchy and the fighting
continued all night. The German ma
chine gun defenses were finally smash
ed by British shells.
On the rest of the battle front the
Germans made good their defense in
High wood, but lost ground and prison
ers both east and west of it. The
total number of German prisoners
taken so far in this fighting is about
400, most of whom are Bavarians.
The Germans fought hard to hold their
last position on the ridge, but the
weight of the British howitzer fire
and the impetuousness of the attack
were resistible.
MEDIATORS IN SESSION
Mexican and Amerloan Conferees Seek
Solution of the Much Discussed
Border Problems.
New London, Conn., Sept. 11.—The
American-Mexican Joint commission
resumed today its effort to find a solu
tion for the problems along the inter
national boundry. This was the third
joint discussion. Luis Cabrera, chair
man of the. Mexican delegation, pre
sided.
Since their meeting three days ago
the American members have devoted
much time to a study of government
reports on the various phases of the
border problem.
^They are counting also on the per
sonal knowledge of the situation which
Maj. Gen.Tasker H. Bliss will be able
to supply on his arrival from Washing
ton. Before the meeting began Secre
tary Lane expressed confidence that
a constructive plan of action would
soon take definite shape.
So far there has been nothing more
than general mention of the Mexican
request that Gen. Pershing's forces be
withdrawn from Mexico. The basis
of the plans for policing the line that
have been talked over, however, Is the
return of the Amerloan troops to their
own territory ensuring that movement
as the first step toward establishing a
permanent system of protection against
border banditB.
An inquiry which has tor its object
the return to Mexico of Americans
with property interests there was be
gun here today by the commission. It
was indicated that if the facts dis
closed warrant it, the state department
might withdraw Its warning that
Americans stay out of the neighboring
republic for the present

PINCHOT FAVORS
HUGHES' CANDIDACY
Chicago, Sept 11.—Glfford Pinchot
prominently identified with the pro
gressive party, today made public a
statement in which he announced his
intention of supporting Charles E.
Hughes. Mr. Pinchot said he is neith
er a democrat nor a republican, but a
progressive and that in view of the
fact that there is no progressive can
didate for president, he must vote for
either the democratic or the republi
can nominee.
"As a progressive I believe in na
tionalism," says the statement. "So
does Hughes. I am certain that under
Hughes the progressive policies will
fare better than under Wilson, and
that the safety, honor and welfare of
the country will be in immeasurably
surer hands."

Fair weather prevailed and this was
expected to cause a big vote, equally
desired by both sides. A governor,
auditor, four congressmen, two U. S.
senators and a state legislature will be
chosen.
The state officers are now demo
cratic and that party £as one U. S.
senator and one of the four congress

In 1914 the progressives cast 18,226

Both sides claim they will receive sut

the election.
The polls opened at 6 o'clock and

Chicago, Sept. 11.—Housewives of
Chicago were today urged to weigh
the bread they buy and to assist the

FILLS INTO THE RIO
Many Workmen Are Known to Have

Rush Launches to the Rescue.
Quebec, Que., Sept. 11.—The span
of the world's greatest bridge oollap
sed a»d fell into the St. Lawrence riv
er today with a loss of life variously
estimated. The company erecting the
structure placed the number of deaths
at upwards of twenty-five, but H. P.
Borden, a member of the Quebec
bridge commission, expressed the opin
ion that only three persons were lost
Several hours after the accident hap
pened at 1:30 o'clock a special train
into Quebec brought twenty men who
had been injured.
Nine years ago a similar accident at
the Bame spot took a toll of seventy
lives. Today ninety men were carried
into the river when the 6,000 ton
span, being raised from pontoons in
an engineering feat designed to com
plete the $17,000,000 cantilever sus
pension for transcontinental railway
traffic, plunged a distance of, fifteen
feet into the water and sank 200 feet,
perhaps never to be reoovered.
Contradictory stories were told re
garding the oollapee. The pontoons
nad been removed and the span was
being lifted by massive hydraulic
jacks when, according to some of the
speotators, the northern end of the
span fell with the breaking of girders.
Frantic efforts were made to plaoe a
chain rope around the tottering struc
ture but, with reports Hke shells ex
ploding, the remaining supports snap
ped and the span disappeared with a
tremendous splash. Some observers
said the structure buckled at the cen
ter as It fell.
Groups of men at work slipped off
into the water and others were knock
ed into spaoe by flying debris. Scores
of craft containing spectators went to
the rescue and their endeavors pre
vented a larger loss of life.
Very Costly Bridge.
The bridge was being constructed
at a cost of $17,000,000 in order to
shorten the railway Journey from Hali
fax to the Canadian northwest by 300
miles.
The bridge stands on the site of the
structure which collapsed on August
29, 1907, with a loss of seventy lives.
The central span, which fell today,
weighs more than 5,000 tons and is
640 feet long.
The span had been constructed on
pontoons a few miles east of the
bridge site and was towed into posi
tion immediately under the gap left
in the anchor arms of the structure.
Chains with links thirty inches In
diameter, together with girders, were
then attached to the span and 8,000
ton hydraulic jacks commenced the
stupendous task of lifting the span in
to place.
This work could be accomplished
only a few feet an hour, and as the
distance from the river level to the
floor of the bridge is 150 feet, the en
gineers had not counted on complet
ing the operation until the end of this
week or later.
The bridge was to have been ready
for train service next spring, mark
ing an Important milestone in Can
ada's engineering railway history.
