Membership campaigns will be put

Welfare work.
Our people are enthusiastic over-
the work that has been accomplished
by the League the past year, as evi
denced by the liberality of the appro

Let every good citizen join the
League at once, pay the membership

ONE HUNDRED
THOUSAND
State Guards will Lose Votes
at November Election
Many soldiers serving on the bord
er are losing their right to vote at the
primaries and at the general election
as a reward (?) for their patriotism
and fidehty in time of national stress.
These National Guardsmen, over a
hundred thousand of them, were sent
to the border to protect American
citizens and American property from
the raids of the bloodthirsty brigands
across the Rio Grande. Each of
them left "positions in civil life which
paid them many times the amount of
their government pay. The sacrifices
they have made are not small. And
yet there is no governmental law
which gives them the right to vote at
their company stations for the civil
officers who are to rule them when
they return 'to their homes. The
soldiers from a few states enjoy this
privilege through state made laws,
but the many do not. It is a shame,
a disgrace, a travesty upon the vaun
ted justice of this country, and shou'd
be remedied without delay The
man who is willing to shed his blood
for his country should not be depriv
ed of his right to vote because of that
willingness.

Opening.
ENROLLMENT 400 PUPILS.
Tho John 11. A'kinsotr Memor
ial School opened yesterday tin
der auspicious circumstanccp.
There were quito a largo numbrr
of citizens present in addition to
the school board.
After assembling the various
grades in the auditorium Prof.
O. E. Dadlay asked J. R, Rish to.
lead the school in singing that
grand old song, "America."'
R3V. Connowoy then read a chap
ter in the Bible and Rav. Gnnt
led in prayer. The following cit
izens wero then called on fot
short talks and all responded;
Rev. Connoway, Rev. Grant,
Jap. R. Rish, F. B. Arnold, Geo.
Mothershead, Dr. A. O. Sisk and
Ernest Newton. Tho talks were
all uplifting and impresah e along
educational lines and the chil
dren who paid close attention
were doubtless much banefitod.
Tliore is not a reason why
Ellington should rot continue'
to have one of tho best t-chools
in the state. They have the tal
ent in both tho faculty and the
chillien, All of the teachers,
without exception, are members'
of tho church and a number are
Sunday school teachers. They
seem to realize the enormous re
sponsibility resting upon them
and have never yet failed to re
spond to the demand for extra
duty, such aj teaching night
school and doing other' work.
without extra pay. Tho citizens
of Earlington stand firmly be
hind the teachers in most cases,
realizing that their children are
now being shaped for the future
and unless they respond to the-
jpportunity now presented anil
secure an education they will in
after years be hewers of wood
and diggers of ditches for others.
As one of the speakers said all
that is tecessary for us to have
the best school in the stato is far
everyone, teachers, pupils ana
parents to pu'l together and pall
the same way and the thing i&
done.
