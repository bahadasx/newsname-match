(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 11. Maine republicans, reinforced by returnina
progressives, won a signal victory at the election today. They elected a
governor, an auditor, two United States senators and four representatives
in congress and are wresting control of the state house from democratic
control.
Carl E. Milliken led his ticket, defeating Governor Oakley C. Curtis, who
sought re-election, by a plurality of approximately 13,000.
The republican drift extended to county offices, the greater number of
counties choosing republican county attorneys and sheriffs. These offices are
important locally, because the holders are charged with enforcing the prohi
bition law.
The vote was heavy, as had been expected, for the campaign had been
waged with a determination not seen in recent years. The country was
searched out for speakers ot national prominence and the greater number of
these battled on national issues. The fight was particularly hot for the two
United States senatorohips and the four places held by Maine in the lower
house nt Washington. National defense, the tariff and the eight-hour law
for railroad employes loomed large in the speeches.
United States Senator-elect Frederick Hale toniar-t sent a telegram to
Charles E. Hughes, who had shared in the campaign, claiming that the vote
was an endorsement of Hughes' candidacy for the presidency. Governor Cur
tis issued a statement asserting that anything less than a republican plurality
of 15,000 would indicate that the people of Maine wished to uphold the
president.
The progressives, who two years ago cast 18,226 votes, returned largely
to the republican party in the opinion of republican leaders. The closest fight
was for congress from the second district, where Representative Daniel J.
McGillicuddy was defeated by Wallace H. White, Jr., by 500 plurality.
United Stales Senator Charles K. i
Johnson, whose wide personal popu-1 electoral vote of Maine to President
arity had Riven the. democrats great
hope for his return, was defeated by
Frederick Hale, son of the ex-senator,
by approximately 9,000 votes, For the

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
CHICAGO, Sept. 11. "Maine gives
the first appeal for a return to a pro
tective tariff and the first answer to
the Adamson bill," Alvin T. Hert,
western republican campaign man
ager, said tonight
"There is not even a trace of cold
comfort for the democrats In the
returns from the Pine Tree state. The
democrats were strong in the state
and counted on the fact to biing
them victory. The progressives and
Wilson and two years later resulted in
the election of Governor Oakley C.
Curtis, a democrat, by a plurality of
.'..189. Tonight's figures indicate that
the larger percentage of the pmgres

1S.22G. was cast today for the repub
lican ticket.
Throughout the campaign, in which
a great number of men from all pans
of the country, and drawn from re
publicans, democrats and progressives,
participated, national issues were kept
to the front. The interest aroused, to
gether with perfect election weather,
brought out one of the largest votes
ever cast in the state and possibly
greater than has ever been known be
fore. For the first time the two United
States senators were elected by pop
ular vote and the republicans made a
determined effort to win the one seat
in the senate and the single seat in the
house held by Maine democrats. The
democrats had claimed the state by
3,oi0 and the republicans by IS. 000.
The Indications early tonight were
that the state legislature had been won
by the republicans, who now control
the senate. The lower house is dem
ocratic. Early figures showed a re
publican gain of five seats In tbo
house and two in the senate.

since the Intel borough Rapid Transit

traction situation in New York tonight
assumed a more serious aspect.
I-alior leaders held conferences dur
ing the day on the question of seeking
a sympathetic strike among various
other trades which would call out lo,
1)00 workers in the Metropolitan dls

definite action could be expected fo
at least a week. The first demonstra

day, when union teamsters employed
by two brick-making concerns, quit
their ousts rather than haul sand to

QULIUCC, Ont.. Sept. 11. With the
loss of eleven lives today, the sec
ond attempt to bridge the St. Law

when the massive center span,
weighing 3,10 tons, suddenly col
lapsed and fell into the river. Of the
ninety men caught on the span when
It began to sway, all were rescued
except the eleven, and of these only
four bodies have been found.
Th span was being raised from
pontoons and was about fifteen feet
above the water when, from some
unknown caxise it collapsed and sank
into the rier, which is 200 feet deep
it this place.
The St. J-awrenee river was filled

hore were hundreds of persos who
ame by rail and automobile to see
the culmination of the mighty en-
ineerlng project. The big steel
frame was taken in tow to the gun
vhich it wa expected to fill.
Shortly after S o clock the pon-
oons reached the allotted place and
were withdraw by tugs, leaving the
massive girder resting on hydraulic
acks. These had begun to raise the
g span while the crowds shouted,
thinking they had seen the most

The ninety men or more who were
on the span were tnrown into tne
river, and about sixty-five were res
iled bv pleasure crafts.
At a late hour tonight, eleven were
listed as dead and missing. The
first reports were much exaggerated,
and gave the list of dead as eighty

E
For the first time in many days
none of the war chancellories reported
any great gain by its armies today.
Probably the most significant move,
was that of the British in the Ru
mania region of the Greek Macedon
ian front. Here, after hard lighting
the British threw their forces across
the Struma at Jseohori (Neochari) at
the southern end of Lake Tahinos
(Lake Takinos), which lies between.
Seres and Orfano, and at several oth
er places near the lake. In addition,
four villages were captured and held,
notwithstanding heavy counter at
tacks by the Teutonic allies.
Whether this offensive by the Brit
ish means the beginning of an at
tempt at a drive through Bulgania .r
is merely a maneuver to throw the
British line near Kavala, which is 25
miles east of Necdori, has not yet
been apparent. From the west of the
Vardar river at Lake Doiran, the
French are violently bombarding Bul
garian positions, and from the front
guarded by the Serbians the Bulgar
ians have been compelled to withdraw.
In the' Rumanian theater the Aus
trian are in retreat before the Ru

valleys, while to the north of Her
