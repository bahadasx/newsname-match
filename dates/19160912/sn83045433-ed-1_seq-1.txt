French and Serbians Strike
Simultaneous Blows in Al
lied Offensive.
(U7 1he Internattoal News service.)
Londom, Sept. 11.-The allied drive
from Saloniki has begun.
The British, forming the right wing
of the Macedonia army, took the lead
by crossing the Struma near Lake Ta
hino. and with a swift thrust against
the Bulgarian defense lines, captured
four vilages.
The entente center, formed by the
French, opened a terrific drumfire on
the Bulgarian lines between the Var
dar and Lake Doiran.
The Serbs, constituting the left, far
to the west, launched an attack en
masse near Ostrovska Iake, wrested
two villages from the Bulgarians, and
followed on the heels of the retreat
ing defenders. Simultaneously, they
started a drive against Florina, seven
teen miles southewest of Monastir. put
ting the Bulgars to flight in disorder.,
Tonight a battle rages on the whole
110 miles front from Florina to the
Strums.
The French war office statement,
which recounts these initial blows in
the long-postponed Macedonian cam
paign, makes it clear that the Bul
gars are putting up 2 bitter defense.
The French bombardment between
the Vardar and Lake Doiran is being
"answered with great violence."
And on the British front the Bulgari
ans are "obetinately defending them
selves."
King Constantine. of Greece. the Hoh
enzollern relative, loomed up suddenly
tonight as the possible commander-in
chief of the allied forces in Macedonia.
Before the campaign for the reconquest
of Serbia and the Orient Railway has be
gun ir earnest Greece will have cast her
lot definitely with the entente unless all
signs on the Macedonian horizon lie.
King Constantine today personally ac
cepted the demands of the entente to dis
sove the reservisionists' league, members
of which last Sunday mobbed the French
lIgation, crying. "Long live the king!
Down with the entente:"
Meanwhile the spark of revolt flies
thick and fast throughout the Hellenic
kingdom.
Athens is virtually under martial law.
Its garrison has been increased by 1,500
marines.

TAKES HAND IN STRIKE

London, Sept. 11.-In a dispatch from
Berlin to the Daily News, Rutledge Ruth.
erford says:
Germany hs decided to declare a block.
ade against England, effective on Jan

For this purpose, a powerful fleet of
submarines is being completed, and plan
are being worked out to make the block
ade a stringent one.
The movement of the submarines, i
l said, will be guided to some extent
by Germany's high flying Zeppelins.
These submarines and Zeppelins will be
equipped with extra sensitiye wireles
appara.tus.
One high in the councils of the Ger
man naval administration today said:
"By the end of the year andperhaps
a little sooner, Germany will have in
fighting trim 300 submarines of the most
efficient type, and no food or ammunition
will be permitted to reach England. For
ours will be a real blockade, one suc
as England pretended to institute against
Germany."
No compunction will be felt regardi
the revival of submarine warfare, be
cause it is felt that England's abroga
tion of the declaration of London ham
left Germany free of restraint in the
matter of her promise to America.

12 DIE AS QUEBEC
BRIDGE SPAN FALLS
Giant Arch Collapses While Being
Set in Place.
(By the Internatiesli News service.)
Quebec, Sept. ll.-The great central
span of the Quebec bridge over the St.
Lawrence, the largest structure of its
kind in the world, collapsed today and
sank 20 feet into the river.
Ninety men were carried down with
the -.(W-ton arch. Late tonight the
number of dead was placed at twelve.
Most of the few survivors rescued
by small vessels that glutted the river
at the time of the disaster are seriously
hurt.
Thousands witnessed the catastrophe,
Including members of the Canadian and
Australian parliaments.
The hoisting of the central arch into
place was the last big task in the gigan
tic engineering project that will repre
sent an investment of S17.M.000. and a
vast throng had gathered from afar and
near to see the span swung into place
from the pontoons upon which it had
been placed.
Today's collapse is the second accident
of its 'kind to the bridge. Nine years ago
a span fell into the river, exacting a toll
of 70 lives.
Stories a4 to the actual collapse differ.
The immense steel arch had scarcely been
raised fifteen feet from the pontooms
when it plunged to the surface of the
river and sank 200 feet.
According to the consensus of opinion,
the northern section of the span fell first.
due to the breaking of the supidorting
girders.
Frantic efforts were made to get chains
around the tottering span, but before this
could be done the remaining supports be
gan snapping with a series of reports
similar to an artillery bombardment.
