four places held by Maine in the low
er house at Washington. National
defense, the tariff and the eight-hour
law for railway men loomed up large
ly in the speaking.
United States Senator-elect Freder

"Maine today has blazed the way
for the rest of the country. We have
elected our governor, two United

in congress.
"The Progressive party today
supported the nominee. A reunited
Republican party has become a realty
in Maine. The campaign was waged
and won largely on national issues
and the results are a triumphant en
dorsement of your candidacy for
president."
