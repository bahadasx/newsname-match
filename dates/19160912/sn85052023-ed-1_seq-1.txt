PARTY'S BIG DAY
THOUSANDS OF DEMOCRATS AT
WINCHESTER SATURDAY.
Vice fio.ucm " ,. viuci

Notables Upen National Cam-
paign m Kentucky,
Somewhere between 10,000 and
15,000 enthusiastic democrats gath
ered at Winchester Saturday to hear
the first gun of the present cam
paign fired. Great preparations had
been made for the big event and
splendidly was the program carried
out. Probably every county in the
State was represented, while Cen
tral Kentucky counties furnished
democrats by the thousands the lit
tle city of Paris sending over more
than 100 autos of the faithful. It
was a great day and one that will
long be remembered.
By o o clock in the morning dem
ocrats began to arrive in Winches-
ter and they continued to come until
noon, some came in uuggies, some,. Tjfi, i,. cu ,
in autos, some on trains, while oth
ers either rode horseback or walked
It was anything to get there and respondent at Ottenheim for a num

, i u j i .V i i ure in joining with their host of
goo and barbecued meats that seem- .... ,. ,
ed to be on hand in an inexhausti
lle supply. And when it is told
that it was good it is poorly express
ed; it was par excellence.
The burgoo and barbecued meats
weie served to all, but in a pavilion,
back of the ampitheatre, there was
a dinner that was fit for the gods.
Burgoo, fried chicken, old ham,
baked apples, corn pudding, barbe
cued shoat, lamb and beef, sherbet,
ice cream, etc., etc. It was the work
cf the good women of Winchester
and it told in silent tones what mag
nificent housekeepers are found in
Clark county's capital. Admission
to this pavilion was by ticket. There
were seven tables and at the one in
the center were seated Vice Presi
dent and Mrs. Thomas R. Marshall,
Gov. and Mrs. Stanley, Ex-Gov. Mc
Creary, Congressman W. J. Field, of
the Ninth district, Thomas F. Hef
li", of Alabama, Campbell Cantrill,
cf the Seventh, Hon. W. P. Kimball,
of Lexington, Judge Stephenson and
Judge Garner, of Winchester, Judge
Clayton, of Alabama, and many oth
er distinguished democrats of the
State and nation. Congressman Helm
of this city, was invited to this table,
but there were not enough seats for
his party, so he preferred remaining
with them.
At 10 o'clock Judge John E. Gar
ner, chairman of the committee on
arrangements, introduced to the
great crowd Congressman Campbell
Cantrill, campaign chairman, and
turned the rally oyer to him. His,
speea:rnibiHgScr'was"orieofthV
good things of the day. Mr. Can
trill then introduced Hon. Rufus
Hardy, of Texas, who represents the
district represented in years gone by
by Roger Q. Mills. Mr. Hardy took
the place of Hon. Scott Ferris, of
Oklahoma, who could not fill his en
gagement. He made a great and
telling speech. He dealt in facts
and figures, which usually are tedi
ous, but which were not so in his
case, so well did he entertain and
edidfy his hearers. His tributes to
President Wilson brought prolonged
applause, as did the many good
points he scored. His effort of one
and one-half hours was given rapt
attention, and yet his hearers want
ed more. Mr. Hardy made many
friends for himself and the great
cause for which he spoke.
An intermission of an hour was
announced and the inner man was
well taken care of.
At 1:20 P. M., Vice President
Marshall was introduced by Mr. Can
trill and for an hour he greatly in
terested his hearers. The vice pres
idert is a deliberate, pleasing speak
er and a hard hitter. He reviewed
the work of the democratic party in
the Iat three and a half years and
told of the great work accomplished
bv the head of the nation. In paying
respect to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Marshall
said. "If the kite can be sent up
without the tail, I would be perfect
ly willing to sacrifice my own elec
tion to see President Wilson return
ed to the White House for another
four years in order to afford him an
opportunity to demonstrate to the
people the value of democratic doc
trine." This appreciation of the be
loved President was loudly applaud
ed as were all other references to
the greatest President this genera
tion has ever seen. Mr. Marshall
said so many good things that space
forbids the enumeration of even of
the best of them. Suffice it to say,
tht his speech was highly appreci
ated and enjoyed by all.
Chairman Cantrill at this point in
troduced Congressman W. J. Fields,
who in chosen words presented Con
gressman Thomas F. Heflin, of Ala
bama, who is no stranger to Ken
tucky democrats, lie having spoken
from the Stanley train in many Ken
tucky towns last November. He is
a sort of an OUie James speaker, and
is a story teller as good as the best.
By the way, he and Mr. James are
very close friends and are so much
together in Washington that they
are frequently referred to as Damon
and Pythias. His references to
Nominee Hughes were very amusing
and brought forth much laughter,
while his excoriation of the repub
lican party must have made the few
republicans that heard him wince.
He predicted Mr. Wilson's election
by a big majority and was certain
that Kentucky's vote would be in
the number that were cast for him.
Said he: "I know Kentucky is a
democratic State and this outpouring
of Kentucky democrats today means
more than that they are just hear to
hear the speeches that are adver
tised." He paid a glowing tribute
to Mr. Wilson and was thankful that
he lived in a day when such a man
was at the head of the government.
For more than an. Tiour Mr. Heflin
held his audience, and as vast as it
was, the order was almost as per
fect as at a Kentucky prayer meet
ing. It was a great day for democracy
and everything, including the weath
er, seemed to conspire to make it
the magnificent occasion that it was.

TACK CAUSES DEATH
A tack in a shoe is said to have
been responsible for the death of
Mrs. Claude Wheeler, who lived in
Casey county, a short distance from
the Marion county line. Mrs. Wheel
er's death was due to blood poison
ing brought on by wearing a shoe
with a tack slightly protruding above
the bottom. It was not sb uncom-
f ortable that she could not wear the
shoe, and she did not for a moment
suspect that wearing it might result
seriously. Lebanon Enterprise.
Noble Woman Gone
Mrs.
Priscilla Drye Passes Away
Suddenly at Hustonville.
Lincoln county lost one of its very
best women Sunday evening when
the spirit of Mrs. Priscilla Bailey
Drye returned to the God who gave
it. Death came suddenly and acute
indigestion is believed to have been
the trouble. Mrs. Drye was in her
usual health during most of the day,
but complained a little in the after
noon. All of a sudden she grew des
perately ill and in a few short mo
ments the grim reaper had done its
work. Deceased was a sister of
Judge Bailey, of this city, and the
mother of W. S. Drye, deputy sher
iff. She is also survived by two sis
ters, Mesdames Josephine Hocker
and Helen Huffman and a daughter,
Mrs. W. L. Evans. She was the
widow of Dr. W. S. Drye, who pre
ceded her to the grave a quarter of
was born within a short distance of
where she died, 82 years ago. She
had never lived more than two miles
from Hustonville. Since a child she
had been a member of the Christian
church. In her earlier days she was
a splendid worker in the Master's
vineyard, but during the last decade
conditions were such that she could
give but little time to church work.
But this does not mean that she did
not do the work of a christian, for
no woman tried harder to help oth
ers and make others happy than did
the subject of this sketch, whose
passing away brings sadness to ev
ery heart in the section in which she
lived so long. Her life was an in
spiration to many .nd her good
deeds while in the flesh will be re
membered long after the sod has
settled on the grave that marks her
resting place. Truly could it be said
of this excellent woman that "None
knew her but to love her; none
named her but in praise." Un
bounded sympathy is felt for the son
and daughter, the brother and sis
ters, and the grandchildren, who
loved her dearly. May they find
comfort in the thought that their
loss is their gain and that the gentle
spirit of the Godly woman now
basks in the sunshine of Him who
doeth all things well. Brief ser
vices were held at the home of W.
L. Evans, where Mrs. Drye lived and
died, by her pastor, Rev. A. H.
Baugh, and were continued at the
Hustonville cemetery. The Huston
ville vocal quartette rendered sev
eral beautiful selections, after which
the remains were laid to rest by the
side of those of the husband to await
the resurrection morn.
WM. F. PERRIN DEAD.
Mrs. S. J. Embry, Sr., received a
wireuFriday telling ofthe -death at
Dearborn, Mo., of her brother-in-law,
William F. PerrTn, at the ad
vanced age of 97. Shortly after
marrying a sister of Mrs. Embry in
1840, he removed from Stanford,
where he was a merchant, to Missou
ri, and had lived in that State since.
Mrs. Perrin died many years ago,
but three children of the 11 that
were born to Mr. and Mrs. Perrin,
survive their father. Deceased was
a fine old gentleman and there are
many of his old friends in Lincoln
county who will learn with regret of
his death.

Rooster This Time.
Middleburg, Sept. 12.
W. G. Raines, of Liberty, who has
been a life-long republican, tells us
that he will vote for Woodrow Wil
son and the whole democratic ticket
this year. Judge Raines was twice
elected county judge as a republi
can, but says the party has left its
first principles, besides has become
wonderfully corrupt and as President.
Wilson has followed the paths of
right and" justice, he feels that it is
his duty to support him.
W. T. Moore, who went to Hod
genville on the 4th inst. to see Pres
ident Wilson, was delighted with the
trip, and says he would not have
missed it for many times the amount
it cost him. He has always been an
admirer of Woodrow Wilson, and is
sure now that he did not over-rate
him. In describing Mrs. Wilson, he
says she reminded him very much of
Miss Ruby Lee Fogle, and by the
way, Mrs. Woodrow would take that
as a compliment if she could see
Miss Ruby. Jack Walls drove the
car that carried the party from here
and they went thru with but little
trouble.
The meeting at Green River church
continues with good crowds, but
there have heen no additions up to
this writing. Rev. Gabbard is preach
ing some fine sermons and much in
terest is being manifested.
Rev. Chick, pastor of the Baptist
church at Liberty, will assist pastor
K. G. Martin in a meeting at Grove
so we are told. The meeting will
be held some time in this month.
In conversation with several dem
ocrats while at Liberty Wednesday,
we were assured that the party was
in better fighting shape than ever
before in this county. Senator Chas.
Montgomery's kind and courteous
treatment of Hon. Harvey Helm has
won for him the admiration of ev
ery one, and put everybody in a
good humor, if indeed anybody was
mad, and the whole push is at work
for the Wilson-Marshall-Helm tic
ket from head to foot.
We learned while at Liberty Wed
nesday that the notorious Bill Tur
pin, who has been in jail for nearly
three years, was fined small sums in
two more cases which will give him j
some 50 days more to board with
Jailer W. T. Brown. Judge J. C
Carter offered to dismiss those cases
if he, Turpin, would promise to quit
selling whiskey, but Turpin refused
and the cases were tried.
Bill Foley, who did quite a big
boot-legging business here in the
early spring, has been catching it in
the neck at Liberty since circuit
began a week ago. The fines alone
which have been assessed against
him, will, keep him in jail for two
years more, to say nothing of the
jail sentence attached to each fine.
Bootlegging is .a dangerous business
to engage in in Casey.
Don't forget that after Oct. 1st,
the I. J. subscription price will be
$1.50 a' year but till then you may
subscribe for as many years in ad
vaace as you wisb at $1 a year.
INSULTS TO WILSON
ALL ANSWER RADS GAVE TO
BLACK'S FINE SPEECH.
Lieutenant Governor Tells of Presi
dent's Splendid Achievements,
But "Davy" Insults Him.
Lieut. Gov. James D. Black open
ed the campaign here Monday for
the democratic ticket, before a
crowded house. He was introduced
in a ringing speech by Congressman
Harvey Helm and at once launched
into the subject matter of his ad
dress. Gov. Black first took up the In
come tax question, saying that he
regarded it as one of the most im
portant measures passed by a dem
ocratic Congress. He showed clear
ly and plainly how the wealth of this
country is made to pay its equal as
sessment of taxes, and how the
greedy millionaires have heretofore
under reDublican protection, been
able to shift the burden of taxation
from their own shoulders, where it
justly belongs, to the unprotected
wage earner. In detail the speaker
explained the wholesome good de
rived from the Regional bank act,
showing how under its provisions, it
is now impossible for the monopolies
and corporations to corner the mon
ey markets and thus create a panic,
and then when the time comes for
a presidential election, the republi
can soeakers go before the country
and claim that the cry of hard times
comes because of a democratic ad
ministration. In beautiful and oft
times poetic language, Gov. Black
told of the fearful hardships of the
child laborers in the country, and
how under the recently enacted
child labor law, no child under the
age of 16, can be placed in a factory
for purpose of labor.
His masterly and eloquent defense
of President Wilson's foreign poli
cy brought forth round after round
of applause, and on every side was
heard the highest praise of his splen
did address. He called on the re
publican speakers to say whether or
not they would have plunged the
country into war, if they had occu
pied the position of President Wil
son, saying all the enemy did in their
speeches was to villify the president
for his management of the many
didfficult questions that had come
before him.
After Gov. Black had closed his
address. Dr. R. L. Davison intro
duced Mr. King Swope, of Boyle
county. In his introduction, Dr.
Davison lauded Mr. Swope to the
skies, apparently . forgetting,, that
four years ago, he was equaUyjbJitterHw
"when Swope spoke here for the'BulI
Moose party. In opening his intro
ductory, Dr. Davison took occasion
to use some very insulting and bru
tal language, saying that this coun
try now had no honor, that Wood
row Wilson was a cowardly cur, and
that he had acted so weak-kneed
when strife with a foreign country
was threatened that the United
States had lost cast with all nations
of importance. It had been agreed
that the audience should hear both
Mr. Swope and Gov. Black, but after
the insulting remarks of Dr. Davi
son, many fair minded men of both
parties left the court room. Mr.
Swope spoke for about one hour,
and his remarks were somewhat on
the same lines as those of Dr. Davi
son, though not as caustic. He
criticised the foreign policy of the
president though he never would
say what the republicans would have
done had they been in power. He
made a very good address, but as
one old line republican put it,
"These is too ticklish times, to be
sending out schoolboys," and Mr.
Swope had to be content with the
applause of a number of the colored
brethren.
