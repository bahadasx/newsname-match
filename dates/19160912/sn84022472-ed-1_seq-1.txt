ing Medical Examiner.
Strangled to death and thrown
beside the roadway on Kossuth street
near Beecher street, a baby girl,
hardly a day old, was found about
7:30 o'clock this morning by August
Lieberum of 32 Autumn street, jani
tor of the Huntington Road school.
Police are at work on the case.
The body of the child, perfectly
formed and evidently only recently
born, was wrapped in several thick
ness of paper. The child had 4een
dead only a few hours when found. A
stout string had been tied about its
neck and cut deeply into- the flesh.
Acting Medical Examiner Edward
Fitzgerald examined the body and
stated that there was no doubt but
that the child was murdered.
Mr. Lieberum was walking over
Kossuth street on his way to work at
the school when about 20 feet from
the .corner of Beecher street he no
ticed a bundfe of newspapers lying
beside the road about two feet from
the roadway. His curiosity, aroused
by the sizev of the bundle, led him to
investigate.
Feeling of the bundle', he after
wards (Said that it felt as though it
contained chicken when he pressed
the flesh of the infant. Tearing the
paper he vwas surprised to see the
head of a ' child.
. He hurried across the street to the
home of Benjamin Aimley on Beecher
street and informed him of His ghastly
find.' Together they returned to the
spot and while MtAimley remained
to see that the body was not disturb
ed, Lieberum hurried to the home of
George F. McKeel at 627 Huntington
Road to telephone the police. He got
in communication with . Lieutenant
William OXeary of the Second pre
cinct station- who detailed Policeman
Harold Sherwood to Investigate, and
notified the acting medical examiner.
The body was wrapped in paper
such as that which is used in butcher
markets, and outside of that were
several thickness of a Bridgeport
newspaper, dated August 31, and also
a Worcester newspaper of the issue
of September 4. A label from a
cartridge box of the U. M: C. Co.
also was found among the papers.
Dr. Fitzgerald after viewing the
body had It removed to the morgue
of Cullinan & Mullins where the au
topsy, was performed. It disclosed
that the child was of recent birth and
had evidently been killed early this
morning. "
Whoever threw the body hy y the
road, which is travelled very seldom,
evidently did so hurriedly as on both
sides of the street a few feet east,
there are great clumps of bushes, and
the body could have been hidden in
them with less chance of being dis
covered. Police are inclined to be
lieve that the body was thrown to the
roadside by someope in a passing ve
hicle during the early hours of this
morning and that the intention was to
cast it among the bushes or into the
empty lot, in front of whicft it was
found.

BRITISH DESTROYER VIOLATES
AMERICAN NEUTRALITY: HOLDS
UP SHIP BOUND FOR PHILIPPINES
Washington, Sept. 12 Violation of
American neutrality by a British tor
pedo boat which held up and ex

department and will be made the
subject of a vigorous protest to Great
Britain.
The incident occurred yesterday one
mile and a half off Carabao Island.
According to the report of the steam-i

Health Expert Completes
Labors Here and Compiles
Recommendations.
Dr. Abraham Sophian, the epidemio
logist who has been supervising
Bridgeport's health department for
two months, has completed his work
in Bridgeport. He expects to leave
Bridgeport tomorrow. His report to
Mayor Wilson, published in' The Far
mer today, reviews the conditions here,
and renews recommendations that he
has favored through the columns of
the press during his activities here.
He dwells especially upon the need
of keeping up the larger organization
he has made of the health department;
of providing clinics and of carrying
out the welfare building and city isola
tion hospital projects he has been ad
vocating. Dr. Sophian will receive $5,000 for
his work here. His letter follows:
Dr. Sophian's report addressed to
Mayor Wilson, "says:
"Two months ago .1 was engaged
by the Commissioners of- Health of
Bridgeport to take temporary charge
of your Health Department, with the
special view of reorganizing the del
partment 'and instituting suitable
measures against infantile paralysis.
During these , two months many
changes have 'been made in the or
ganization and management of the
Health Department. ' Many tempor
ary special regulations have been in
stituted against infantile paralysis and
a number of permanent ordinances
have been passed, notably those con
cerning the production and sale of
milR for the city of Bridgeport, and
measures of general sanitation. The
latter ordinances- are intended to be
permanent and should be rigidly en
forced. That sanitary measures
should be rigidly enforced: and that
education, " and co-operation of the
public is necessary has been amply
proved in the' great reduction of the
diseases of childhood in the past two
months.
"I shall take the liberty of refer
ring to some of the mone important
work of the Health Department
which needs or has needed attention.
Administrative Department. '
"It is absolutely necessary to have
adequate and competent heads of a
department to obtain efficient work.
There is urgent immediate need of an
experienced and able physician to
serve as associate Health Officer. Un
less this is immediately done, I fear
the organization will suffer serious
ly. ' ' 1
"The sanitary department is well
organized and equipped. The chief
inspector is a competent, conscientious
worker and executive. I believe it
would be of benefit to make the office
of chief sanitary inspector a perman
ent, one. Competent executives are
hard to get a good worker in such
position is so important that he should
be . encouraged to develbp as much
as possible. The sanitary depart
ment has added a number of inspec
tors. . The present force is none too
large and I would earnestly, advise
against the arbitrary cutting down of
the staff. The saving of a few dol
lars at the expense of efficiency is.
expensive economy in the sanitary
department. ' ' ,
"I must emphasize the importance
of a highly efficient organization in
the health department which must not
be hampered or crippled through lack
of help or funds. 1
"A working system of permanent
records has been instituted and should
be of considerable permanent value to
the city. This system of records has
been placed in the charge of a clerk
who has been trained up to the work.
This should be continued.
."I would advise that the present
method of handling vital statistics be
changed. Reports of death should be
made to the health department and
Issuance of death certificates should be
made by . the health department after
Its investigation. In this way it is
possible to check up important cases
of contagious diseases in the city, to
say nothing of cases of death from
questionablesources.' 1
: "The working staff has been enlarg
ed by quarantine officers. Ths is the
only .definite way of Instituting quar
antine and should be continued.
"The method of sending diagnos
ticians of the health department to all
cases of contagious disease is the
most satisfactory method of early

THE WEATHER
Fair and Slightly warmer tonight;
Wednesday increased cloudiness.
On releasing the Cebu, the lieuten
ant made this note on her log:
"Boarded at 3:60 a. m., 9-11-16, ex
amined and passed."
There has been more than " one
complaint about the activity of Brit
ish vessels around the Philippine Isl
ands and while Governor-General
Harrison's report furnishes the basis
for a specific protest, it la' probable
that Great Britain will uecalled upon
to restrict the operations of her pa
trolling squads generally and in near
the territorial waters of the islands.
In order that there might he no
mistake about where the Cebu was at
the time she was held up, the exact
position was given by the master as
follows: Latitude 14 degrees, 16
minutes; Longitude 120 degrees, 35
minutes, or one and a half miles from
Carabao Island.
