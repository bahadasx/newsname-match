RESULT 0 A
TIE PART!
With Both U. S. Senators, AH Four Congressmen, Gover
nor and State Officers Elected by Republicans, the
Leaders Claim That Yote Points Way to the Election
ol Hughes and Fairbanks
Augusta, Maine, Sept. 12. Return
of progressives to the republican fold
will make the G, 0. P. majority In
Maine's elections yesterday over 12,
000 practically complete returns to
day showed.
The re-unlted party made a clean
sweep of it in the Pine Tree state
gubernatorial, senatorial and con
gressional. It Increased republican
strength In the state legislature.
Two yeurs ago the progressive
gubernatorial candidate polled a trifle
over 18,000 votes, and the democrats
won by about 3,000. The difference
is about 15,000 votes.
There were only a few scattered
precincts to be heard from at noon
today and tho republicans claimed
15,000 would be practically the total
of their majority.
" Tn other words, they claimed that
practically 100 per cent of the bull
moose hnd returned to the old party.
Tho republican victory waa made
Impressive In the fact that their fight
and the democratic defense was
waged exclusively on national Issues
It was really Wllsonism versus
Hugheslsm.
Headquarters for both parties here
tabulated figures showing that the
majority attained iby the republican
gubernatorial nominee, Carl E. Mllll
ken waa 13,400 ahead of Governor
Curtis.
Colonel Fred Hale, who opposed
probably the strongest democratic
candidate in the state Senator
Charles V, Johnson end the man
whom democracy above all others
tried to elect, since he typified the
Wilson politics, had a majority of
9,500 votes, according to virtually
complete figures.
For the short term aa United States
senator, Bert M. Fernald, republican,
won from Kenneth C. M. Sills, with
12,000 to spare.
The four republican congressional
nominees were elected with vote to
spare, except In the Second district,
where Daniel J. McGIUU'uddy, demo
crat, whose re-election had been
liractlcally conceded by the repub
licans, was turned out by a bare 502
votes.
"The result leaves no doubt In my
mind aa to the election of Hughes in
November," Frank J. Ham, republi
can state campaign manager, declared
to the United Prees today. "Our
majority will reach more than 15.
000 by tho time the border vote now
represented In the missing precincts
Is heard from."
The republican committee exhibit
ed a mens go from Governor McCnll
of Massachusetts, declaring:
"The result of the" Maine election
Is an unmistakable Indication of a
strong trend, which I believe Is
nation-wide, toward the republican
presidential candidate." ,
Attorney General Pettangnll, cam
paign manager for the democratic
slate committee, aald:
"The vote does not represent the
majority the republicans have had In
this atate In past presidential years.
A similar republican majority In 1892
was followed, It may be remembered,
by a sweeping of the country by
Orover Cleveland,"
"Then yon don't think Maine will
'point tho way' this year?" he was
asked.
"Maine la normally republican, and
Has a Paper With Full Leased
IS REUNITED
by the Nation in November
look what happened in 1892," the
democratic leader rejoined.
While belittling Maine's Infallibil
ity In forecasting the election two
months hence, democratic leaders
were plainly disappointed at their
showing at the polls. Democracy
poured Us strongest campaign ora
tors into the Pine Tree state. They
started a fire under Hughes' labor
record, they preached eloquently how
Wilson "kept the country out of war,"
and they stood pat on his Mexican
policy. Five cabinet members did
missionary work.
The fact that the state issues were
subordinated for national questions
In the fight made republican politi
cians here believe that the republican
victory really does mean something
nationally In the way of a trend back
to the vrty which was ousted from
power four years ago. They pointed
to the fact that Ralph D. Cole, chair
man of the republican national com
mittee's speakers' bureau, concen
trated former bull moose speakers in
to Maine Roosevelt, Medlll Mc
Cormlck and others of that type
and made a particular bid to welcome
"the party that was" back Into the
O. O. P.
Maine voters, they said, used their,
heads, because while the general state
and national tickets were overwhelm
ingly republican, the down easterners i
elected democratic sheriffs, county
attorneys and other county officers In I
all but two counties. They elected
these officers at home on local lssuefe,
according to the republican view
and they chose others who were to
represent them at the state capital
and In congress on the Issues of na
tional Importance.
LARGE ORE BODIES
Seattle, Sept. 12. Stinging one
'thousand scientific specimens of Arc
tic biological life, and news that vast
copper deposits are waiting on Coro
nation gulf and Bathhurst Inlet to
ibe mined, scientists of the Canadian

SPECIAL SESSION
OF DIES IS
Chicago, Sept. 12. A special ses
sion of congress to pass a national
woman suffrage amendment was sug
gested to President Wilson today fcy
Miss Alice Paul. Washington, D. C,
chairman of the congressional com
mittee of the Woman's party. Miss
Paul's statement follows:
"The overwhelming defeat of the
democratic forces in Maine Indicates
how necessary to Mr. Wilson will be
91 electorisJ votes in the 12 states
where women vote, so as to enable
him to win In November.
"We suggest to Mr. Wilson that n
take heed before it is too rate and
call a special session of congress to
pass the national woman suffrage
amendment. Only In this way can
he hope to avert the vote against him
and his party in these 12 doubtful
weetern states of the members of the
Woman's party."
G.O.P. VICTORY SEEH
BY MAINE ELECTION
Washington, Sept. 12. 'There la
now no question about Hughes' elec
tion," said Congressman Frank P.
Woods, Iowa, chairman of the repub
lican congressional campaign com
mittee, commenting on the Maine
election.
"The whole fight will be over the
seats In congress. Yesterday's result
makes it necessary for us to elect on
jly eight more senators to seats now
(held hy democrats to overturn the
democratic majority, while a change
of 15 will do the same thing in the
house. We expect to win a working
majority."
The vote In Maine Is a good omen,
according to Secretary of the Navy
Daniels.
j "An analysis of the vote shows that
about "7.000 republicans voted for
jMllllkeu, the republican gubernatorial
nominee," said Daniels, "from 69,000
to 70,000 republicans voted for re
publican senatorial nominees. This
means that from 7,000 to 8,000 re'
publicans voted with the democrat!
on national Issues.
"In the old days republican majori
ties were engulfing. The average ma
jority was about 80,000. When this
Is remembered, the 1 5,000 majority
of yesterday seems .paltry.
"It was only to be expected that
more progressives would turn back to
their old party In a rock-ribbed re
publican etate than would desert to
the democracy. This will be the
ease In all normally republican states.
But In doubtful states, such as Now
York, the majority of progressives
will stay away from their old stand-
pat friends."

New London, Conn., Sept ll. ,
American farmers to till Mexican soli,
and American teachers to train Mexi
can minds that waa a plan before
the American-Mexican peace commis
sion today. -
Such a program was intended to be
part of Mexico's contemplated regen
eration. The commission agreed that
it wonld be feasible.
As formulated thus far, the scheme
Is only to have such numbers of
Americans as will set an example for
the Mexicans and there ts every In
tention to avoid anything that smacks
of American Interference pr control.
The Mexicans presented data today,
supplementing yesterday's on rail-, -roads,
to show that there is an honest '
effort to make the rich country be
low the Rio Grande blossom anew
after six years of civil strife.
They told the American commis
sioners that while crops in some parts .
of Mexico have suffered from lack of
labor, other portions show a remark
able productivity. These essential, ,
underlying economic problems will be .
thoroughly probed before the ques tion
of withdrawing American troops
Is determined definitely.
Both sides agree that work mast be
provided, and that the uneducated '
must be taught before Mexico can
have any assurance of continued pro
gress. President Wilson's presence in New
London, six miles from the Giiswold
hotel, commission headquarters, bad
no effect upon the meetings. The
American group stated that their visit
there last night was strictly to pay
their condolences, and not to talk
Mexican matters.
Secretary of the Interior Lane and
hla conferees hoped to be able to re
port to the president within the next
few days a definite plan contemplat
ing withdrawal of, American troops
from Mexico and restriction of the .
border patrol, with fewer men than
at present.
New London, Conn., Sept. 12.
Supporting their claim that the Car
rania regime Is now in a Btrong post- -tlon
and that its strength will become
even greater, the Mexican commis
sioners announced here today that s.
call tor a constitutional convention
may be momentarily expected. The
convention will be followed by state
and presidential elections. The con
vention Is expected to sit before the
first of next year. . .
The morning conference between ;
the American and Mexican commis
sioners today was given over to con
sideration of political developments
In Mexico since the Aguas Callentes
convention.
All of the commissioners called on
President -Wilson today to pay theltj r
