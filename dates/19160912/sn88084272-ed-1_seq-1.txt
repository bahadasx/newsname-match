Roosevelt's Chief Supporter 1
Gives His Reason For
Working For Hughes.
Philadelphia, Pa.. Sept 1J. Gif
ford Pincbot. Roosevelt's right hand
in the Progressive campaign of
1912. has made public deda-ation of his
Intention to do all he can to support
Hughes's candidacy. In his published
statement he presents the following in
dictment of president Wilson and bis
policies:
"President Wilson has a greater pow
er than any other man in public life to
say one thing but do another, and get
away with It
"We have heard him tell Germany
publicly that she would bj held to
strict accountability: and have learned
afterward that he had actually let her
know secretly at the time, by the
month of his secretary of state through
the Austrian ambassador, that what he
said he did not mean. We have seen
him prove that he did not mean it by
his total failure to exact reparation,
apology, or even disavowal for the mur
der of Americans on the Lnsitanla.
"There was no need of war. But If
Wilson had shown courage this coun
try would not have skidded from one
crisis to the next, again and again nar
rowly escaping disaster.
"He declared against Intervention In
Mexico, while actually Intervening to
dictate who should and who should not
hold office there: and denounced war
against Mexico while actually engaged
in war.
"For more than a year after the
world war began, Wilson did not raise
a finger to put us In a condition of de
fence. Only the proverbial good luck
ef America has kept us from paying

navy, then declared for incomparably
the greatest navy In the world, and
then went back on that

Pledged him to a single term as presi
another term.
"He declared for effidency In gov
ernment, and then set the pork barrel
a.na. tnrew eiiiciencr away.
For
six administrations, the government
business has never been so badly done
and so extravagantly as It Is now done
under Wilson.
"He announced himself as the cham
pion of civil service reform: and then
turned the government departments
.over to the spoilsmen as no other presi
dent has done in 20 years.
"He declared for pitiless publicity:
and has conducted the most secret ad
ministration of our time.
"It Is bad enough that Wilson's for

Know to te right
"The ignoble standard of "profit and
principle' which Mr. Wilson forced up
on the country in our foreign relations,
he has applied to himself as president
In what he has said, done, and left un
done, the record shows him steadily
dominated by political expediency.
"I do not care what his platform or
his campaign declarations may be. be
cause the common experience of us all
has taught us. that to him. they are
simply -molasses to catch flies.'
"Hughes, on the other hand, is a man
of his word. His record as governor of
New York proves that It shows him
to be honest, fearless and free from the
domination of special interests and cor
rupt politicians. He Is a strong man
who will dodge no moral issues, and he
will give us an honest and an effident
administration.
"I can not vote for Wilson because I
can not trust him. He does not do what
he says. Hughes does. Therefore my
choice is Hughes, and I shall work and ,
