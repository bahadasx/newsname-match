BIG BARBECUE
DRAW CROWD
Tbrwig Estimated at Twelve Thous
and Assembled at Winchester
Last Saturday.
A crowd estimated nt between
tck and twelvo thousand people
gathered at Winchester Saturday
to attend the big Democratic Love
Feast and the meeting was a most
enthusiastic one. .
--Th. Administration of President
Wilson was given tho highest praise
by Vice President Marshall, Con
gressmen Hardy, of Texas, and
- Hflflin, of Alabama. We arc es
pecially proudi of the delegation
from old Montgomery which num
bered more than six hundred.
Representative Hardy, of. Texas,
who spoke before noon, is a rank
ing member of the IIouso Commit
tee on Merchant Marine and Fish
eries. His speech was a forceful
nnd logical rovicw of the achieve
ments of the Democratic party
since tho inauguration of President
.Wilson.
Vice President .Marshall, the first
speaker of the afternoon, wns
greeted by an enthusiastic demon
stration. Ho delivered an impres
sive speech a much better spceqh
than was expected of him by those
who had not heard him since bis
campaign for Governor of Indiana.
His voice was clear and distinct
and he was heard by a largo pro
portion of tho crowd. He held ,the
attention of the audience and. his
teliing points frequently elicited
spontaneous applause. More., than
once ho aroused the Democratic
hosts to enthusiastic cheers. He
was particularly effective in des
cribing tho speeches of Hughes as
echoes, pf stand-pat Republican
speeches in the Senate;,
Representative Hellin, of Ala
bama, proved the great entertainer
of the day. His eloquent and
forceful contrast of Democratic
and Republican policies was inter
spersed with stories, told only as
Heflin can tell them, that kept the
big crowd in a roar. If Heflin had
not gotten into politics nnd into
Congress he might have been n
star on the minstrel stage. To this
capacity as an entertainer ho adds
real oratorical power and his
speech was a forceful presentation
of the Democratic position in the
campaign.
We will. have to "tako off our

Does It Pay?
Docs it pay to advertise in dull seasons? No use an
swering a question with a theory when facts are
at kand facts lilfo these:
July nnd August used to bo dullest months of all the year
in the furniture business now they are the busiest because
advertising turned 'dullness into activity.
""
r Janunryw'as formerly a time' when men's clothing stores
did no business, Now, by advertising, they make record sales.
"' ' : ,,?
Right down the list instances can be cited where mer
chants and manufacturers have turned supposedly dull periods
into busy, ones.
And they did it by advertising by newspaper ad
vertising in most instances. ;
Sitting around cussing the fweather won't ring the
cash register, but advertising wHl. Newspaper adver
tising coupled with good merchandising will drive any
dull month from the calendar. Perhaps not at once, but
little by little. (
Now is the timo to increase business for the immediate
present nnd get a flying start for tho Fall. Now is the time to
make your advertising plans and to begin an aggressive bid for
business.

Master Bruce Blevins, Aged Fif
teen Years, Dies of Kidney
Trouble This Morning.
Bruce Blevins, eldest son of Mr.
and Mrs. William Blevins,., died ht
his homo on Antwerp avenue this
morning nt two o'clock after an
illness of many months' duration
of kidney trouble, and while his
death was not unexpected still it
comes ns a shock to the many
friends of the family that one so
young should bo called-
It is .sad to give up one whose
influence among men would doubt
less have been for good; who by
precept and example was so well
calculated to spread abroad' the
blessed influence of godly living,
l'ct He who doeth all things well,
makes no mistakes. Thu human
link snapped asunder on earth is
forged anew in henven. Tho yearn
ing parents mourn not ns one
without hope. It is true thnt when
beautiful youth is gone not much
of life remains; hence tho dear
one's oyes are closed to all earthly
trials. In his springtimo of en
thusiasm nnd tenderness, ero the
sunshine of hope and joy was ex
tinguished, he passed to the glor
ious beyond.
Tho silver card, is loosed, the
golden bowl is broken, tho dust has
returned to tho. earth as it wns;
tho spirit hns returned to tho God
who gave it. Tho devoted boy who
remembered his Qreator in tho
duys of liis youth, cru the evil days
enme, or the years drew nigh when
ho should sny I , havo no pleasure
in them, has flnishcYl his courso
and reached tho heavenly goal
whilo yet an infant in tho rnco of
life.
Besides his parents deceased is
survived by sevoral brothers and
sistors. Funeral services will bo
conducted at the rosidonco tomorrow
(Wednesday) afternoon nt 2:30
o'elook by Rev. B. W. Trimble nnd
tho burial will tako plndo in Much
