Berlin, Sept. 11, (via London.)
Russian attempts to capture the town
of Halicz on the Dniester in Qalicia, re
garded as the key to the defenses of
Lemberg from the southeast, have
been frustrated by the Teutonic
forces, according to today's official
War Office announcement. Troops
under General Count von Bothmer
brought the Russian efforts to naught,
the statement declares. Russian at
tacks in the vicinity of Stare-Czerwiz-cze,
on the Stokhod forty miles north
east of Kovel, also were repulsed, ac
cording to the official announcement,
which follows :
Army group of Prince Leopold: On
both sides of Stare-Czerwizsze. the
Russians, who again attacked in
strong force, suffered a sanguinary
repulse, as on Saturday.
Front of Archduke Charles Francis:
The battle between the 'lota l.ipa and
the Dniester on Sept. 7 and 8 proved
to be an attempt by the Russians,
exploiting their gain of territory on
the fith, to break through by a quick
subsequent assault on Bursztyn
(twelve miles north of Halicz) and nt
the same time put themselves In pos
session of Halicz. (ieneral Count
von Bothmer, with a defense cleverly
conceived and carried out with equal
cleverness, frustrated this plan, the
Russians suffering extraordinarily
heavy losseB.
In the Carpathians the situation
generally Is unchanged.

New York. Sept. 12. Two persons

The first demonstration of a sym
pathetic strike came today when un

Hugh Frayne, an organizer of the
American Federation of Labor. to
night predicted that a sympathetic
strike would be called within a week
among several trades closely affiliated
with the operation of traction lines
numbering approximately 7n. nun men.
These would include longshoremen,

necessary before a strike could be
called, Mr. Frayue said.
Violence in connection with the
Strike occurred at several points to
day and one serious demonstration
was broken up only by vigorous action
on the part of police reserves. Ar
rests were frequent, but no one was
seriously injured in the disorders
throughout the City, police reports
say.

BIG SLUMP IN CROPS
Corn Alone Shows a Shrinkage of
67,000,000 Bushels.
Washington, Sept. 8, Hot and

icctive production of corn. 43,000,000

Reduction of the com crop in north
western Arkansas, southwestern Mis

shocked the Greek public and seri

mere suggestion of the possibility of
King Constantine commanding the al
lied armies in Macedonia, however,
seems to override every hesitation.
The 1 eported opposition of Russia
and Italy to Greece's co-operation in
the war is actually much less than
had been believed, and the Servians,
far from objecting, are most anxious
that the Greek's join the entente al

the French commander, would be glad
of the assistance of the Greek soldiers
who fought against the Bulgars three
years ago.

TWO PROBABLY DROWNED
No Trace of Burlington Men Who

drowned, it is thought sometime
I'liursday while on their way to Juni

The men. in a more or less intoxi
cated condition, it is stated, left the
boat bouse of Kdgar Chiott on EOihg

words they spoke were to Clarence
Chiott. son of the boat house owner.
8 colored man who keeps his boat
it Oak Ledge claims he saw them
half way between the breakwater and
the island. He was not however,
near enough to speak to them. They
never readied the island.
The theory that the men quarreled

caused the boat to overturn, is likely
as both showed a quarrelsome dis
position when last seen.
