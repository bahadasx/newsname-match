Brinton as his candidate for govern
or at the urging of John M. Glenn

Brinton by John M. Walker, pres. of
the Illinois Federation of Labor,
!S?hlpljas backed up byja fire fron
the Chicago Federation of Labor,
considerably weakened the Sullivan
slate, they believe. Walker said
Brinton's candidacy was "an insult
to union labor."
By union men Brinton is rated far
below Frank Lowden, Pullman Co.
