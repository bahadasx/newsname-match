Wilh Scant Wearing Apparel He Invades
Station at Pocasset Challenging
All to Fight
SHOT DOWN BY
DEPUTY BROCK
Paid No Atlenfion to Crash on Skull
With Plank or to Wound Made by
Rock But Made for Officer
Apparently having gone "dippy"
over the war, Kaspar Sost, a sturdy,
muscular German of twenty-six, bran
dishing a large pocket knife ran amuc k
at the railroad station at Pocasset and
was only brought down by a gun
wound inflicted . by Deputy Sheriff
Brock after all other means to control
him had failed.
Sost was clad only in trousers,
shoes and gloves, a large part of his
anatomy being exposed. He accosted
evry man, woman and child whom he
met asking if they were seeking him
and whether thoy deii-ed a fight.
Among those whose path he crossed
were two lady school teachers wh)
seemed at one time to be in imminent
danger of attack.
4 Defied Passenger Train.
TI's first public appearance was
made a short distance north of the
station at Pocasset while tramping in
to that town from Minco. He dis
regarded the warnings sent out by the
engineer of the oncoming passenger
train and wildly waved his arms in de
fiance to the iron monster which was '
steaming toward him. The -engineer
slowed up and at the last moment
Sost left, the track.
Shot by Sheriff.
Arriving at the station he waved his
knife threateningly at every one whom
he passed. Deputy Sheriff Brock was
hastily summoned but Sost would not
respond to reason. He started toward
the officer with open knife when
some one landed on his skull with a
rock. This halted him only for an
instant but that was long enough to
give Deputy Brock a chance to pick
up a small plank with which he in
flicted a scalp wound which required
two stitches. This did not feeze him
and the officer then shot him in the
leg, the ball passing through the mus
cle under the knee, which brought the
German to the ground and caused him
to drop the knife. Only the efforts of
by slanders to lasso him, which caus
ed him to slash repeatedly at the rope,
gave the deputy sheriff the require'!
time between assaults to get the ad
vantage , without having to kill his
man.
Sost had been employed shocking
corn on the farm of Joe Clay son west
of Union City and had been left with
a task. When Clayson returned to
look for him his farm hand had disap
peared and nothing was learned of
Sost till he readied Pocasset.
He was brought in here last night
by Deputy Brock, after hurried atten
tion had been paid to his wounds.
Wants to Enter' Army.
Tn the sheriff's office this morning
Sost said he was twenty-six years old,
a former resident of Brink, Germany,
where he is listed for military service
and that when he was winged at Po
casset he was on" his way to New Or
leans to ask the German consul to
send him back home to engage in the
war. He had served both in the army
and navy, he said, and had spent sev
eral years as sailor on various German j
liners but had left that service four
years ago to go to Mexico.
The man was evidently unbalanced
and did not recognize the officer who
had floored him when they met this
morning.
Off the Firing Line.
County Physician Emanuel dressed
his three wounds this morning and af
ter covering his head with a cap made
of bandages a la mode the wounded
man had the appearance of a man who
had just come off the German firing
line. v
Wants to Go Back.
Sost modestly asked Sheriff Bailey -
for money enough to get back to Ger-
tnany to which the officer remarked
that there was not money enough in
the county
to get him back there
