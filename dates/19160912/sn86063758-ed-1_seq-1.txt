GOOD LEAD ON AIKEN
v Congressional Race fai Third
District Cansing Great' Deal of
Attention.
CongresMjmaJ Tace in tne i nira ;
district hwtirfen Fred H. Dominick
and Wyatt ^Liken the incumbent is
attracting -widespread attention not
only in the district but throughout the
state. Mr. Aiken is the only congressman
iti South Carolina wiho
not returned in the first primary.
The race in the Third dstrict is in
teresung irom many vie* ptuuia. uui- .
ing Congressman Aiken's service of 14 ;
years he has been compelled to run a
second race only twice?two years
ago with Mr. Dominick and this year
with the same candidate. The primar/
ot- a week ago is the only one in which !
9 I
a competitor has polled more votes j
than Mr. Aiken, Mr. Dominick leading ;
the present congressman by aoout
1,000 votes.
f\!r. Dominick and Mr. Aiken are :
both hard at work in the district, Mr. j
Aiken having left his duties in Wash- j
ington to look after his interests in the
distrct. It will be remembered that j
his official duties would not permit j
him to meet his opponents on the
stump during the regular congressional
campaign.
Indications point*strongly to Con- j
gressman Aiken's defeat by Mh Domi- '
mc-K in the second primary next T^es- ;
day.
The Third district is tne lar gest m
'the state, ithere being about 28,000 vot-:
ers enrolled. More than 25,000 votes j
were polled in the first primer/.
