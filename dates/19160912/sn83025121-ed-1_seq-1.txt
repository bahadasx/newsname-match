by the British, who drove out the ene

Observers here and la Athens are in
clined to the belief that the allied com

launch a drive through Bulgaria, with
the object of taking the Germans and
Bulgarians now attacking the Ruma

mean the cutting of the Central Pow

that it might be lifted into place.
Second Accident to Bridge
This is the second catastrophe which
has happened to the great bridge,
which was to have been completed in

The Quebec suspension bridge, as it

There was little or 'no. disturhanee,
the balloting for the moat, part going

Republican Plurality Large
The latest returns from all over the
state indicate that Carl E. Milliken,
he Republican candidate for the gov
ernorship, had a plurality of approxi
mately 1.1,000 over -O. C. Curtis, his
Democratic opponent. When almost
complete the count gave' Milliken
7 'M.-, and Curtis 04,987. , '
The senatorial fight, which was
more intense than the gubernatorial
struggle, also resulted jn a Republican
victory. The Republican leaders had
concentrated their attacks upon Charles
F Johnson, senior senator from the
state. Johnson is extremely popular in
some sections of the State, and the Re
publicans coitcedeil that he would make
n strong fight nnd had a good chance
of winning out in the election.
Stand On Tariff Disastrous
After the returns showed; that tie had
been defeated, a number of State lead
ers declared that his stand 00 the
I lanrr nan oeteateii him, and nothing
i else. The vote was closer for Johnson
t Ii ii n for any of the other candidates,
the senator easily running ahead of
Ins ticket, lie lust by approximately
4.100 votes.
One of the Republican candidates for
the lower house is still in doubt as to
his fate, but the other three were
elected by handsome pluralities.

NKW YORK, Heptember 12. "As
Maine goes so goes the eountry, is tbe
way the lenders at the Republican na

ceived the news from Maine.
"They have repudiated Senator John

the tariff legislation in congress. He
was the member of the finance eommit

him." 1 . ' '
So said other Republican leaders
here, but the I lemocrats ,saw the Maine
results with a different eye.-
" I'nlesa Maine gives the Republicans
1.1.0IK) plurality it will mean that the
state us a whole has upheld President

as well us the dnmestio legislation, ho
has caused to be enacted daring bis

Others asserted that the results in
Maine indicate thut the Democrats will
