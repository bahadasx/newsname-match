MADISON, W. Va? Sept 12.?John S.
i _ Darst, state auditor, who Is a candljf
'date (or reflection, opened the Repubr
llcan campaign here last night with
li1 L a speech which, while It was largely
L A analytical of the business management
ftt.vOf the state, was decidedly Interesting
B i and well received by his auditors.
Y: "When, after comparing conditions today
with those that existed In the days
IB when the Democratic party controlled
the state government Mr. Darst asked
Tl If the people wanted to return to the
V earlier practlcos the answer was a
r thunderous "No!"
Auditor Darst said In part after
qnotlng from a speech made at Clarksburg
in April of this year In which the
Democratic candidate for governor
.-.said: "Your taxes since 1904 have rapIdly
gone up, up. until in many cases
properties are assessed seven, ten and
fifteen times as much as they were as"
sensed In 1903. They have now laid a
V levy of 14 cents, and many a man who
has property is paying today five
It" times as much as he paid with a 35
^ cent levy under the old plan."
? The tax laws were passed some
J twelve years ago. At that time the
/ state tax was twenty-five cents on the
[i. .hundred dollars valuation, making a
total of thirty-five cents for state and
njuvitwi yui|n/ooo. iug aBDCDoaicms, as
VVmade In counties on real estate, were
rtf so unequal, some counties having a val?".
nation of twenty-five cents on the hun?
dred dollars and running up, in other
*?'?iuntlea, to sixty and seventy cents on
rfe' the hundred dollars. Under these valuatlons,
some counties contributed
iip' much more than tbolr fair share to the
- running expenses of the state, while
ifc- others paid much less than their fair
fc share. The new law, however, conH&.
tains provisions for the re-assessment
[.of all real estate at Its true value. In
Bgf': order to secure a more uniform assessfc
ment This was done with a much
Bfi: nearer approach to uniformity than
ftftjras ever had before.

p. "all the property, both real and personal,
in their respective counties.
i'-' with the exception of the public ser

RUMORS OF MORE I
PARALYSIS FALSE
Case On Newton Street Imprdving
and Quarantine
Is Rigid
No new cases of infantile paralysfs
have been reported in Fairmont today
and this disease is as yet confined to
the case on Newton street where the
little girl of Mrs. John Holt is said to,
be recovering quickly with little danger
of serious or permanent results.
A number of rumors of other cases
have tilled the city one of which proved
to be only a child with a sprained |
arm. This was the little daughter of ;
Mr. and Mrs. Clay V.'illey of View
street. Dr. Howard, who is attending
the pationt reported today that the
child was rapidly recovering from a
fail she received some time ago and !
lias not developed the slightest symp-|
torn ot paralysis. Anotner rumor or
a case on Fifth Btreet near Locust av- j
enue, at (lie home of M. J. C.'omuntzis !
proved to be false as the little girl at!
this place Is now almost recovered !
from an attack of pneumonia from ;
which she has been suffering for the
past three weeks.
The City health board has the situation
well In hand and is vigorously
enforcing all the canitary and quarantine
regulations so that the possibility
of a further spread of the epidemic is
very slight.

COURT WHEN LOW
BBU1S Dill
Glover Loses His Temper
But Taxpayers Are
Heavier Losers
A. M. Glover, county commissioner
and Democratic candidate tor sheriff
engaged in a wordy dispute this morning
with a designer of the Luden
Bridge company of Clarksburg, during
the session of the county court at
which the contract for the construction
of the new bridge at Everson was
let go to the Meredith Construction
company of Marietta, Ohio, their bid
being $17,988 on the plans submitted
by County Engineer Wilfong, The bid
of the Luden Brdge company of
Clarksburg, who built the new Clarksburg
and Grafton bridges, was but
$16,991, but made on their own plans
which they submitted with the bid.
The'court's refusal to consider this
was the cause of the heated discussion,
the Clarksburg man saying "I am
surprised at the action of this court,
which could have saved the county
a considerable sum on this work. As
to the submission of our own plans),
you have not even looked at them.
Why did you not give us a fair
chance?"
Mr. Glover took it upon himself to
answer the bridge designer and said,
"Your bid was not upon the advertised
plans upon which bidB were asked.
These other men submitted bids upon
our plans so why should we consider
you?"
The Clarksburg man replied: "TI.e
submission of their own plans by construction
companies who bid on such
work is customary and their plans
are carefully compared by county and
city authorities in all progressive communities
where the officials wish to
save the taxpaywers money. Vje have
followed this custom in Ohio and Indiana
and even in other counties in
West Virginia. But here ybu seem to
have, the affair all arranged and have
not given us' a chance to compete."
At this point Mt. Glover arose and
naced back and forth behind the desk
in the court room, saying: "Do you
mean by that statement that we are
not progressive and that we are using
unfair methods? 1 will have you
understand, sir, that we resent that
imnlication and that we consider our
selves second to none! Second to
none! Sir,; 1 repeat that we consider
this county second to tnone!"
County Clerk A. G. Martin at this
point interposed and led the Clarksburg
gentleman out of the room attempting
to explain to him Just how it
happened that his bid had not been
considered. Mr. Glover also left the
room and the meeting was over. The
bid of the Meredith Construction company
was the lowest of the three bids
considered, the other two being Monongahela
Valley Enginering company,
$25,000, and Cole Brothers. $22,675.
The concrete steel company also
bid on the new bridge and their bid
was but$17,500, being lower than thnt
of the Meredith Construction company.
Their bid however was not considered
by the court as they also submitted
their own plans. The design offered
by the l.uden Construction company
was for a three arch bridge with solid
reinforced concrete construction while
that of Wilfong Is a five span bridge
with three piers or columns in the river.
The Luden bridge called for but
two piers In the river. Wilfong's plan
is similar in type to the bride now in
use in the West End on the country
club road.

When the European war restricted r
imports of clay from abroad, the U. s
S. bureau of standards at its Pittsburg I
laboratory undertook a series of ex- e
periments with American clay to see a
if it could produce the fine glaze
which distinguishes the Imported pro- g
duct. This glaze is produced by burn- g
ing the clay. l!
The experiments of the bureau were c
entirely successful, and American
manufacturers were advised of the re- r
suits, and of the fact that American
clay could be obtained which, with
slight treatment, could be made equal
to any of the Imported clays.
Many of these are found in the
south, and are now being produced
for commercial use.
