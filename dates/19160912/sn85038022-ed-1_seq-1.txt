MIKE BROWN
"The Square Deal Man"
Portland, Me, September 11 Maine
HepulilicanB, reinforced by returning
Progressives, won a signal victory at
tl lection today. They elected a
(lovernor, an Auditor, two lulled
Senators, and four Representatives In
Congress and wreatcd control of thr
State Mouse of Representatives from
the Democrats and will be able on
a Joint vote of the legislature, to
elect the other state officers not
chosen by popular vote.
Carl E Mllllken led hla ticket, de
feating Oovernor Oakley ('. Curtis,
who sought re-election by a plurality
of approximating 13,000.
At 10:30 o'clock tonight the Indlcii
Hons based on a tabulation of the vot.1
from a little more lhan half the pre
cincts was that the Republicans had
won by safe pluralities.
If the ratio of the Republican mar
gin is maintained, Rert M. Fernald.
Republican, seems to have been elect
ed for the short term In the t'nlted
States Senate, and the same ratio of
gain would give him a plurality of
0.500.
I'nited States Senator Charles P.
Johnson, Democrat, apparently has
been defeated by Frederick Hale by
an indicated plurality of 7,5m.
Eonr (.. tl. P. f (iiiirrrMiien
If the Republican t'ongresslona'
candidates hold the lead they had ut
10:30 o'clock, four, Louis R. Goodali
in the First District; Wallace H.
White, Jr., In the Second; Congress
man John A. Peters, in the Third, and
Ira O. Mersey, In the Fourth, will b-
elected.
The Republican drift extended tc
county officers, the greater iiunibei
of county attorneys and sheriffs being
Republicans. TheBe officers are Im
portant locally because the holders
are charged with enforcing the pro
hibition laws. The vote was heav
an had been expected for the cam
pafejfji hud been waged with a deter
mination not seen in recent years
The country was searched out for
upeakers of national prominence and
the greater number of these battled
on national Issues. National defense
the tariff and the eight-hour law for
railrond men loomed large In the
s peso haft,
The Progressives who two years
ago cast 18,2l!C votes returned large
ly to Um Republican party In the opin
ion of Republican lenders
The closest light was for Congress
from the Second District where Rep
resentative Daniel J. McGlllleuddy
was defeated by Wallace H, White, Jr.,
500 plurality.
Heavy Vote Cast
The total vote may prove to have
been the largest ever cast in the
Btate.
The election was the culmination of
one of the hottest tights ever waged
in the atute and marked the reunion
of the Republican and Progressive
parties, whose differences In 1912
gave the electorul vte to Maine to
President Wilson and two years later
resulted in the election of Governor
Oakley C. Curtis by a plurality of
3,1 KM Tonight figures indicated thut
the regular percentage of the Pro
gressive vote which two yours ago was
IfcalMk was cast today for the Re
publican ticket
For the first time the two I'nited
States Senators were elected by pop-
ulur vote, and the Id publicans made
.i determined effort to win the one
seat in the Senate and the single seat
in the House of Representatives held
by Maine Democrats.
The following telegrams received
last eveniug by Mr. W. I). Cochran
were iei welcome news lo the
Hughes and Fairbanks followers In
this city, aa the result iu Mulne,
strongly indicates the November out
come :
