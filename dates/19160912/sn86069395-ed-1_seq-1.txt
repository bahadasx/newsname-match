UOE
ON EMBARGO
Speaks For the James Re
taliatory Amendment in
the House.
NO REASON FOR EMBARGO
ngland's Order In Council
Outrage On Tobacco
Growers.
Washington, Sept. 11. Upholding
tho rights of the tobacco growers of
Kentucky to demand that their coun
try retaliate against Great Britain for
the tobacco embargo and strongly
urging the adoption by the House of
Senator James' amendment to the
Revenue Bill, providing for this re
taliation, Representative David H.
Kincheloe delivered an address in the
House Thursday.
"These amendments to the Revenue
Bill will give the President the power
to retaliate whenever injuries are
done to the people of this country,
like the embargo placed upon tobac
co by Great Britain," said the Second
district Congressman.
OUTRAGE ON PEOPLE.
"I do not believe this country should
or will suffer these outrages to be
perpetrated upon the American pco
pie. Tobacco is not one of the neces
saries of life nor a contraband of war.
and no reason can be given why this
embargo is placed, except she and
her -allies hope to buy tobacco from
the growers at their own price and
then sell it to the other countries of
Europe at an enormous profit to
themselves. Great Britain can't with
any consistency give as a reason for
placing this embargo on tobacto that
she doesn't want Germany to have it,
Germany's fighting powers would not
be increased any if her soldiers got
all the tobacco they wanted to chew
and smoke, nor would they be de
creased any if she didn't get any.
Besides, every dollar that Germany
spent for tobacco would leave that
much less in her treasury with which
to buy ammunition, guns and some
thing to cai and wear for her soldiers.
That argument or excuse would fall
to the ground of its own weight.
"This country is big enough and
strong enough to protect the lives and
property of its citizens, and I believe
she will do it. On a great question
like this I am neither pro-English,
pro-Ally nor pro-German, but I am
pro-American. I want to right these
wrongs, and I believe in doing it.
The God of the universe created the
high seas for the whole human family,
and I don't believe in permitting any
nation to monopolize it for her own
aggrandizement to the detriment of
any other nation and her citizens. If
these two amendments are adopted,
which will give the President of the
United States power to retaliate, I am
sure that he will be glad to exercise
this right at once in behalf of the to
bacco growers of this country if
necessary.
WILL RAISE EMBARGO.
"His every act since he has been
President of the United States toward
labor has always been in favor of the
laboring man and the downtrodden.
I don't think he would have to exer
cise this power, for the moment Great
Britain understands that we mean
business and will tolerate the injus
tices to our citizens no longer, she

Kenort Shows Wheat
Production Will Not Be
Enough For Demand.
CARRY-OVER FILLS NEED
Shrinkage of 67,000,000 Bush
els of Corn Yield Estimat
edDue to Drouth.
Washington, Sept. 11. Heavy dam
age to the country cereal crops during
August caused a loss of many millions
of bushels of wheat in prospective
production, cutting down the outlook
for wneat to below tne amount re
quired for home consumption.
The department of agriculture's
monthly forecast, issued today, csti
mates the wheat crop at 611.000,000
bushels less than is calculated to be
necessary for domestic use. A carry
over of approximately 160,000,000
bushels of old wheat from last year's
record breaking crop however, will
make up the deficiency and leave
something like 100,000,000 bushels
available to supply the heavy demands
of foreign nations for Americans
wheat.
Spring wheat, parched by hot and
dry weather, showed a loss of 43,000,
000 bushels since the August forecast
of production, while corn estimates
were 67,000,000 bushels smaller than
forecasted a month ago.
A preliminary estimate of the win
ter wheat cron nlaces the nroduction
at 455,000,000 bushels and thin? of
spring wheat at 156,000,000. The
prospective spring wheat crop is the
smallest in 22 years and 200,000,000
bushels less than harvested last year,
The total wheat crop is placed at Gil,
000,000 bushels which is 400,000,OCO
bushels less than last year's record
breaking crop of 1,012,000,000 bush
e!s. The combined winter and spring
crop is the smallest since 1900 and
the acre yield, the lowest in 23 years.
DROUGHT CAUSE OF LOSSES.
The heavy loss in prospective pro
duction of corn was due to drought.
In many section, particularly in Kan
sas and Oklahoma, many fields of
porn were cut for ensilage or fodder.
The total crop is forecast at 2,710,
000,000 bushels, which is 22,000,000
bushels smaller than the average for
! the last five years.
An annually short output of white
potatoes for winter supply is forecast.
Production of 318,000,000 bushels is
indicated. That is 46,000,000 bushels
less than forecast a month ago and
the smallest crop since 1911.
Other losses from the production
estimates made a month ago are:
Oats 43,000,000 bushels; barley 11,-
000.000 bushels: buckwheat 1.300.000
Hay production is forecast at 86,-
1200,000 tons, which is 1,600,000 tons
! more than forecast a month ago and
1,000,000 tons more than last year's
record crop.

New York, Sept. 11. The strike of
stage employes, longshoremen, brew
ery workers, machinists, bar tenders,
moulders and printers in sympathy
with the unionized car men who quit
their places four days ago, was de
cided upon at a meeting of the heads
of their unions last night, according to
an announcement by Hugh F. Rayne,
state organizer of the American Fed
eration of Labor.
A resolution was passed, calling on
all unionized wage earners in Great
er New York, Yonkers, Mt. Vernon,
White Plains and New Rochelle, sanc
tion a strike "in support of the con
tention of tho street railway men of
their right to organize."
The resolution recommended that
the workers in the various trades
lay down their tools until the com
panies arc forced to recognize the car
men's union."
According to State Organizer Rayne
approximately 750,000 men and wo
men are enrolled in the unions that
were represented at the meeting last
night, m
Before a sympathetic strike can be
declared, however, it was explained
that it would be necessary for them to
call mass meetings of their respect
ive unions and put the proposition to
a vote of the members.
