SWEDEN SEIZES
BRITISH MAILS

a further and rather sharp exchange
of notes between Great Britain and
Sweden in regard to the difficulties
brought about by tho entente allied
blockade and Sweden's retaliatory
seizure of malls in transit between
England and Russia. No solution of
the problem is in sight. The British
'foreign secretary Viscount Grey, in
sists that, as a condition to submit
ting the matter to arbitration, Sweden
must promise not to interfere again
with patrols post matter. The Swedish
government apparently is determined
not to make such an engagement.
It Is notable that untl1 now the cor
respondence has been conducted al
most wholly between Viscount Grey
nd the Swedish minister in London,
Count Wrangeh but Viscount Greys'
latest note to Count Wrangel says the
count's communication Is not under
stood and that the British minister at
Stockholm is being directed to pre.
sent the matter to the Swedish gov
ernment. Count Wrangel now has
gone to tho continent and it is an-
nourcod he will stay for several
weeks. t
