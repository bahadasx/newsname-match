At the Tabernacle tho committees

was eulogistic of tho Wilson adminis
tration, tho county administration and
pledged Its nominees to tho stato leg
islature to work for stato wldo prohi
bition. Tho first nomination was for four
year term commissioner, a. A. Hog
an named Ephraim Borgoson, tho

for the slato, and tho nomination was
made by acclamation.
Postmaster S. W. Hendricks of
Richmond named A. M. Mathews Jr.
for county clerk and tho vote was by

mous for Miss Barber.
Losllo W. Hovey, formerly deputy

Mr. Barker was fought on tho grounds
of third term. Richmond camo down
united on a cnndldato and felt recog

was given tho nomination on tho se
cond ballot and Richmond went homo
without representation on tho ticket.
Naturally the delegates did not llko

From this point on, no ono dared
go against tho steam roller. It was

ONJMULTY
Tho Brlgham Young College can
well bo proud In obtaining thq ser
vices of Mr. Lofter BJarnaBon as as
sistant professor' of Education for tho
coming school year. Mr. BJarnason
Is In no wlso a stranger especially to
Logan und the northern part of tho
Stato of Utah. Ho lb known In this
section of tho country ns ono of tho
most successful principles that Cacho
county us well as Logan City schools
has had. It will be recollected that
three ears ngo ho waB an Instruct

also principal of tho Training school
but becauso of his exceptional abil
ity his services wero sought else
whoro and tho Collego nt that tlmo,

ing tho institution ho has boen prin
cipal of tho Carbon County High

place his services wero sought as
superintendent ot tho Sovior county
schools.
Professor Bjarnason Is ono of tho
most alert, energetic and scholarly

cational subjects . With his many
years of oxporlenco In tho public
schools as principal and county sup
erintendent as well as tho years of
oxporlenco in tho b'.sh tuhools as
principal and Instructor, ho probably
fills tho bill In tho Brlgham Young
College better than any man in tho
Stato ot Utah could possibly do. In
addition to his practical oxporlenco,
Prof. BJarnason is a scholar, clear
thinker, organizer and a faithful stu
dent' Ho Is a graduate of tho Utah
Agricultural Collego and has spent
considerable tlmo studying In tho
