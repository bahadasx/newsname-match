Eight Classes of Untrained

(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. Sept 12. (2:02 a. m.)
A Reuter dispatch from Athens saysiight and up to noon today, had, at
a ministerial crisis is imminent.
Premier Zaimis, the dispatch adds, is
believed to have tendered his resigna
tion. ATHENS, Sept 9, via London, SepL
11. "If the Entente allies and Venl
zelos factions can only keep quiet for
10 days and not embroil the situation,
Greece's entry into the war will be a
settled fact," says a prominent official
to the Associated Press today. "If
not, is is the end of Greece."
King Constantine and Premier Zai
mis conferred at length on the situa
tion today.
The mere recognition of King Con
stantine commanding the allied armies-
in Macedonia, however, seems
to over-ride every position.
The reported opposition of Russia
and Italy to Greece's cooperation in
the war is actually much less than
had been believed and the British far
from objecting, are most anxious that
the Greeks join the Entente. It is
generally conceded in Entente circles
that General Sarrail, the French com
mander, would be glad of the assist-1
ance of the Greek soldiers against the
Bulgarians.
The only menace to the success of
the negotiations lies in the Greek gov
ernment holding T)ut too long in the
hope of obtaining the concessions of
fered 18 months ago but which no
longer obtain.
Eight classes of untrained reservists
in the ages of 33 and 40 years soon
will be called to the colors.
Austrians in Retreat

CHICAGO. Sept. 11. A retluc-
duction by one-third in the size
of the live cent loaf of bread ap-
peared today to have been decided
upon by Chicago bakers, instead of
an increase in price.
City officials announced that
bakers had purchased large qaan-

half pound loaves, intead of the
three quarter pound stamps for-
merly used.
V. S. District Attorney Clyne,

of the five cent loaf had been re-

Clyne today questioned some of
the heads of Chicago's larger

With the border situation set aside

to determining the extent of the con
trol centered in Mexico by the defacto
government the information being
supplied by the Mexican commission
ers at the request of their American
conferees. It was stated informally
that upon the showing made by the
Carranza government rested the pos
sibility that the Washington govern
ment would revoke its warning to
Americans to stay out of Mexico and
would encourage their return to their
properties there.
It was explained that the question
of transportation was vital to any re
sumption of authority in Mexico and
to show present conditions, the Mexi
can commissioners presented figures
from which later information was
drawn.
The Mexican commissioners report
ed their government was operating

Mr. Hughes reiterated his declara

"We have got to have a splendid
stimulus in American patriotism," he
added. "We have got to feel the thrill
of national obligation, we have got to
revive the old spirit that gave us our

have got to take pride in American

we have got to foster every American

Second Attempt to Span St
Lawrence River Fails. Great
' Structure Hurls Hundreds
Into Stream.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
QUEBEC. Sept 1L With the loss
of 11 lives today, the second attempt
to bridge the St Lawrence river here
resulted in a failure when the mas
sive center span, weighing 5100 tons,
suddenly collapsed and fell into the
river. Of the 90 men caught on the
span when it began to sway all were
rescued except the 11, and of these
only four bodies have been found.
The span was being raised from
pontoons and was about 15 feet above
the water when, from some unknown
cause it collapsed and sank into the
river, which is 200 feet deep at this
place.
The St Lawrence river was filled
with many boats at the time of the ac
cident and on the hills along the
shore were hundreds of persons who
came by rail and automobile to see
the culmination of the mighty engi
neering project The big steed frame
was taken in tow to the gap which it
was expected to fill.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the pontoons
reached the allotted place and were
withdrawn by tugs, leaving the mas
sive girder resting on hydraulic jacks.
These had begun to raise the big span
while the crowds shouted, thinking
they had seen the most Impressive
ceremony of the bridge raising. The
spectators began to leave, when sud
denly there was a road of breaking
steel and the span dived into the
water.
