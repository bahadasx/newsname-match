Largest Vote in State's History.
The largest vote in the history of |
Maine was cast at the state election
yesterday. The total vote will approxi

been approached since 1880, the year
the democratic and greenback parties
fused, when the total was 147,802. In
the the last presidential year and two
years ago it fell below 142,000-..
The report from Laredo, Tex., said
that the members of the 2d Battalion
of the 2d Maine Infantry made a two
days' overland march of sixty miles to
exercise the franchise. The vote of the

GIVES BIGGEST SURPRISE
Defeat Not Expected by the Re
publicans?Criticism of "8-Hour
Law" to Continue.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, September 12.?
To the republican national lead
ers the most important feature of
the Maine result, in its bearing
upon nation-wide politics, is the
demonstration beyond dispute
that the progressive vote in that
state has returned to the tepubli
can party by a percentage which,
if maintained throughout the
country, would insure the republi
cans carrying the great northern
and middle west states.
The democratic argument in support
of their claim of a presidential vic
tory in November has been based main
ly upon the belief that the progres
sives would not return in sufficient
numbers to give the republicans the
lead over President Wilson's popular
ity. the labor strength and the "he
kept us out of war" sentiment. Yes
terday 3 vote in Maine, -as analyzed
here, shows that the progressives in
that state came back practically en
masse.
Vote In Past Years.
The combined Taft and Roosevelt
vote in 1912 was 75,038. The combined
republican and progressive vote for
governor in 1912 was 7t,087. The early
figures at hand, when this dispatch is
sent show a republican vote yesterday of
77.045.
But that is not all. It was admitted
. of Pr?gressive vote
of 191- was drawn from the democrats
by Roosevelt, and at least 5.000 of the
progressive vote in 1914 were of demo
cratic antecedents. The republicans are
now asking if the democratic progres
sives; have voted the republican ticket
or did they maintain their strength by
drawing out inherent republican
fnTJfl ' may have 3tayed at home
The next most important feature of
the election yesterday to the republi
cans was the capturing of the doubtful
United btates senatorship.
As stated in The Star's dispatches
^A?LMalne? a republican plurality of
10.000 or better 6n the state ticket
would elect Fred Hale. Senator Bo
rah s prediction, published in Sunday's
Star, forecast his election on the score
of acceptance, by disaffected repub
licans and progressives, of the argu
ment that it would be suicidal for
Maine voters to express a preference
for a republican state and national ad
ministration and at the same time vote
for a democratic senator. Senator Bo
rah s judgment, that the voters were
acquiescing in this argument, accord
ing to his observation of the last few
days of the campaign, is Justified by
the result.
McGillicuddy Defeat Surprise.
In the McGillicuddy district the re
publicans are surprised and the demo
crats dismayed. The "inside" demo
cratic estimate on McGillicuddy last
Saturday was that he would have at
least a plurality of 2,000, while the
republicans expected, at best, to cut his
plurality of two years ago down to a
close margin, but hardly dared hope
to defeat him.
In the case of the McGillicuddy dis
trict and the state ticket, outside of
national bearing, "drys" unquestion
ably wielded a great influence in the
result. As explained in The Stars
correspondence, it fell out that the
republican candidates generally had
the sympathy of the -drys" and the
democrats of the "wets."
In Maine the people, however, do
not always "vote as they drink," and
Maine is a dry state on the statute'
books and the election returns, even
if it is not on the actual consumption
of liquors and beer.
"Clean Up" Lewiston.
I was told in Lewiston that the in
fluence of all the churches there. In
cluding the one whose communicants
are largely of the democratic political
faith, was being quietly exerted against
the democratic ticket to "clean up
L?ewiston."
The election of Milllken as governor
and the election of a number of re
publican sheriffs over democratic can
didates promises a stricter enforce
ment of prohibition, it is generally
agreed. Milliken has said he would
override recalcitrant sheriff? wherever
necessary.
Every republican Joins in giving Col.
Roosevelt unstinted credit for bringing
back the progressives, in which action
he wais aided by Hal P. Gardner, pro
gressive candidate for governor two
years ago; by Raymond Robins of Chi
cago, and other progressives of national
repute.
The Maine republicans were grateful
for the efforts of the senators and rep
resentatives who came into the state
in drawing out the republican vote by
explaining the national issues.
An aftermath feature of the election
of general bearing is the expected contin
uance of Mr. Hughes and the republic
an national management along the
present lines of campaign, including
criticism of the coercion used in enact
ing the eight-hour wage scale for the
railway employes.
Mr. Hughes made a decided hit with
his attitude on that question in Maine.
Toward the close, after Samuel Gomp
ers had taken the other end of the
proposition. Candidate Shale "got cold
feet" on the Hughes argument, fear
ing its effect upon labor. He was over
ruled. The politicians here say the
outcome justifies Mr. Hughes' position,
which will probably become one of
the leading republican issues.

Union leaders Claim Many Subway
Men Join Banks?No General
Sympathetic Walkout.
NEW YORK, September 12.?
The first serious accident of the
street railway strike in this city
occurred early today when a trol
ley car of the Union RailwaysCom
panv in the Bronx, operated by a
"green'' motorman, got beyond
control on a steep grade, and,
jumping the track at a curve,
crashed into two jitney busses,
killing two persons and severely
injuring thirteen others. Four of
the injured may die. The car
crew was arrested pending inves
tigation.
? Night of Riot.
After a night of intermittent rioting,
motormen on the 6th and 9th avenue
elevated roads reported to the police
that they had been fired upon by strik
ers from roof tops. Third avenue ele
vated trains were repeatedly bombard
ed with bricks and stones from build
ings. One passenger, a woman, was
struck on the head and seriously in
jured. Five arrests were made.
The congestion on the subways and
elevated roads today was even more
pronounced than yesterday, due to the
fact that there was little or no service
on the surface lines of Manhattan and
the Bronx. Not a car wheel moved in
the Westchester cities of Yonkers,
Mount Vernon and New Rochelle.
Union leaders claim hundreds of sub
way and elevated employes have joined
the union within the last twenty-four
hours. Traction officials maintain that
all their employes who signed the
"master and servant" contract re
mained loyal.
No General Strike Sought.
Hugh Frayne, state organizer of the
American Federation of Labor, insisted
today that a general walkout by all la
bor unions was not being considered.
He said the present plans of the leaders
contemplate calling out unions closely
allied to the striking railroad men.
John T- Riley, chairman of the Inter
national Longshoremen's Union, de
clared that the members of his organi
zation, numbering between 8,000 and
10,000, are voting on the advisability
of declaring a sympathetic strike.
Frayne said that if a sympathetic
strike were called it probably would
not involve more than 60,000 workers.
In this class he named engineers, fire
men, longshoremen and teamsters.
Strike Not Mitigated.
In other respects the strike situation
today showed no mitigating features.
Every trolley car in Manhattan and the
Bronx remained stationary last night.
Service was resumed this morning on
only a fraction of normal schedules.
The Intert-orough Rapid Transit Com
pany maintains that subway and ele
vated trains are running regularly.
The strikers declare they have made
inroads in the ranks of the company's
motormen.
As a result of limited service on sur
face lines, elevated and subway trains
are crowded. The suburban service of
the New York Central and the New
York. New Haven and Hartford rail
way systems is congested.
Violence continued as the day went
on. Strikers and sympathizers halted
surface cars and set upon the crews
of strikebreakers when the latter re
fused to desert their posts.
Strikebreakers Make Complaint.
Nearly one hundred strikebreakers,
most of them from Chicago and Bos
ton, appealed to Mayor Mltchel and
the public service commission, claim
ing that none of the promises made
when they were engaged had been
kept, and that they were virtually
prisoners In car barns. They alleged
that armed guards prevented them
from leaving and that wages due them
were not forthcoming.
The mayor promised them police pro
tection in their efforts to collect wages.
Engineers Indorse Strike.
NEWARK, N. J., September 12.?The
International Union of Steam and Oper
ating Engineers, In biennial conven
tion here today, adopted a resolution
indorsing the transit strike In New
York city. I?abor leaders active in the
situation there addressed the conven
tion here yesterday.

_ BY HEIRS TO THRONES
Western Front Divided Into Three
Sectors, With a Prince Com
manding Each.
BERLIN, Monday, September 11, via
London, September 12, 12:45 p.m.?
Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria has
now assumed the over-command of the
German armies on the Somme front. He
is intrusted with the general direction
of operations against the Anglo-French
offensive.
All troops assigned to this task are
placed under his control, making pos
sible the distribution of reserves and
the employment of all the means of
war to the best advantage under a uni
fied plan.
Divided Into Three Sectors.
The appointment of Prince Rupprecht
was effective before the latest visit of

an Associated Press correspondent to
Bapaume last week, but the news could
not be cabled until the announcement
in the official army headquarters report
of today, which reveals a general re
arrangement of commands brought
about by the appointment of Field
Marshal von Hindenburg as chief of
staff.
The new order divides the western
front into three sectors, and assigns
these to three princely commanders,
who, regardless of reasons of policy
which clictated their appointments to
command of armies at the beginning of
the war, have won their spurs by the
successful conduct of, operations. They
are regarded here not as figureheads,
but as generals of experience and dis
tinction.
Achievements to Their Credit.
Duke Albrecht, prospective heir to
the kingdom of Wurttemberg, who is
in command of the northern sector, be
fore the war had risen to the rank of
general and corps commander. He in
flicted the first great defeat on the
French in the dash northward through
Belgium. Crown Prince Rupprecht, in
command of the central sector, was the
victor in the battle in L*orraine which
crushed and repulsed the French in
vasion of Germany in 1014. The Ger
man crown prince has the over-com
mand in the Verdun sector.

GREECE'S PREMIER
WANTS TO RETIRE
Report That Zaimis Has Ten
dered His Resignation Is
Officially Confirmed.
GREEKS MAY FIGHT SOON
AS ALLIES OF ENTENTE
High Official Predicts Decisive Step
Will Be Taken Within
Next Ten Days.
LONDON, September 12.?A
Reuter's dispatch from Athens
says that the report that Premier
Zaimis has tendered his resigna
tion is officially confirmed and
that every effort is being made to
persuade him to withdraw it.
Deemed Drift to War.
J The reasons which prompted Premier
Gaimis to present his resignation are
not set forth in the dispatches from
Athens, except that he complained in
ternal incidents were preventing him
from dealing with the external situa
tion. It is believed in London that his
offer to resign was due to the fact that
he accepted the post on the understand
ing that he was to maintain neutrality,
and that in view of the Bulgarian oc
cupation of Greek territory finds this
no longer possible.
Should Greece decide to Join the en
tente, she will do so, it is understood
here, without any guarantees for the
future. There was a time when the en
tente was ready to offer Greece terri
torial advanages in return for her mili
tary assistance. That time has passed,
and if Greece now comes in. according
to report, she must waive the question
of conditions except that the allies will
agree to place munitions and equipment
at her disposal.
May Decide in Ten Days.
ATHENS, September 9, via London,
September 12 (delayed).?"If the entente
and anti-Venirelist factions can only keep
quiet for ten days and not embroil the
situation. Greece's entry into the war will
be a settled fact," said a prominent
Greek official to the Associated Press to
day. "If not," he a iid, "it is the end of
Greece."
King Constantine and Premier Zaimis
conferred at length on the situation to
day.
On the whole the situation with regard
to Greece's entry into the war on the side
of the entente seems favorable, not
withstanding the arrest last Sunday and
Monday by Anglo-French secret police of
German and Austrian agents, against
which Premier Zaimis vigorously protest
ed, and despite complicity by the French
In deference to the

j
in the disaffection of the 11th Greek
division at Saloniki, which profoundly
shocked the Greek public and seriously
endangered the success of the negotia
tions then in progress. The mere sug
gestion of the possibility of King Con
stantine commanding the allied armies In
Macedonia, however, seems to override
every hesitation.
Anxious for Greece's Help.
The reported opposition of Russia
and Italy to Greece's co-operation in the
war is actually much less than had
been believed, and the Serbs, far from
objecting, are most anxious that the
Greek join the entente. It is generally
conceded in entente circles that Gen.
Sarrail, the French commander, would
be glad of the assistance of the Greek
poldiers who fought against the Bul
gars three years ago.
The only menace to the success of the
negotiations lies in the Greek govern
ment holding out too long in the hope
of obtaining the concessions offered
eighteen months ago, but which no
longer obtain.
Eight classes of untrained reservists,
between the ages of thirty-three and
forty years, soon will be called to the
I colors.
* Greek Army Revolt Grows.
PARIS, September 12.?A dispatch to
j the Temps from Saloniki says:
| "The revolutionary movement is ac
| tive at Verria (about forty miles south
| east of Saloniki), where Capt. Bartzocas
I has announced to Gen. Cordonnier, com
manding the French troops, his inten
tion of fighting with the entente allies.
The battalion commander at Verria also
has announced that'his battalion will
participate in the movement.
"These events are parts of a rapidly
extending plan for the formation of a
Greek army of national defense. Nu
merous volunteers for this army are ar
riving here daily, coming from remote
islands and regions of old Greece. The
recruits are equipped immediately with
khaki uniforms and are sent to a camp
a few miles outside the city."
PRESIDENT, NEAR SISTER,
HEARS OF MAINE RESULTS
Makes No Comment on Defeat of
Democratic Nominees at State
Election Yesterday.
NEW LONDON, Conn., September 12.
?President Wilson today remained near
his sister, Mrs. Anna E. Howe, who is
critically ill here. His plans depended
largely on the outcome of her sickness.
Early this morning it was said that her
condition was practically unchanged.
The first newa of the apparent repub
lican victory in Maine was received by
the President from the newspapers this
morning, as members of his party would
not disturb him last night. He would
make no comment this morning.
The Mayflower, with President Wil
son on board, was anchored off Fort
Trumbull, near here, but launches car
ried hourly reports to the President re
garding Mrs. Howe's condition.
Mrs. Howe About the Same.
During the forenoon the physicians
attending the President's sister issued
the following bulletin :
Mrs. Howe had a comfortable night.
Her condition remains about the same."
This news was immediately forwarded
to the President on the Mayflower.
Soon afterward the President and Mrs.
Wilson came ashore and went to Mrs.
Howe's hotel. As they walked through
the main street of New London they
were recognized by many persons.

Reticent as to Conditions
Which Ultimately May In
crease Prices.
PRODUCERS TO CONFER
WITH FEDERAL OFFICIALS
Dairy Men Said to Be Disturbed
Over Watchful Attitude of De
partment of Justice.
Local milk dealers and bakers
are "keeping mum" about the sit
uations which have risen here
lately in their respective trades
which ultimately may raise the
price of milk and bread to the
ultimate consumer. Especially
reticent are the milk dealers as
to what steps they may take if
the threatened increased price is
asked of them by the milk pro
ducers of Maryland and Virginia.
Thursday afternoon at 3 o'clock the
committee appointed by the Maryland
and Virginia Milk Producers' Associa
tion at its meeting Saturday, will meet
officials of the Department of Agricul
ture to go over the situation. The mem
bers of the producers' association were
little disturbed today over the attitude
of the Department of Justice, which
will keep a wary eye open for evidences
! of combination on part of the producers
to raise the price of milk.
Matter of Justice, They Say.
The producers rest their case solely
on a mater of justice, they say, and for
that reason are willing to put the whole
thing up to the Department of Agricul
ture and to the public itself for ulti
mate settlement, not wishing them
selves to make any advance in prices,
but to let the public do this for them as
a matter of Justice, they say.
Acting Secretary Vrooman of the De
partment of Agriculture has appointed
W. J. Spillman, chief of the farm man
agement division, and B. H. Rawle,
chief of the dairy division, to confer
with the members of the milk pro
ducers' committee Thursday afternoon
and get at the justice In the demands of
the producers.
Mr. Vrooman, discussing the matter
today, declared that with questions of
law as to the legality of the rights of
the producers to raise their prices, the
Department of Agriculture has nothing
to do. The department, he said, treats
a large "trust" or an individual in the
same way, and in the present case will
do all in its power to help the produc
ers get a fair price for their commodity.
May Not Have Clear Sailing.
The charge that many farmers will
not accept up-to-date means of produc
| tlon was made today by experts of the
Department of Agriculture, who state
that because of this situation they will
not find all clear sailing when they put
their case before the public.
Rumors around town that certain
bakers had raised the price of bred to
day were not substantiated by the bak
ers themselves, who emphatically de
nied that they had raised the price of
any of their loaves. Bakers in various
west and middle west cities have
stopped baking five-cent lo^aves and are
now turning out of their ovens only
ten-cent loaves.
