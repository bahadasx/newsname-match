By Associated Press
Portland, Me., Sept. 12. The
thoroughness of the Republican vic
tory at the polls yesterday was em
phasized as the returns from isolated
towns and plantations straggled in to
day.
Revised figures placed the plurality
of Governor-elect Carl E. Milllken,
Republican, over Governor Oakley O.
Curtis, at 13,355. Returns from the
border show that the members of the
Second Maine Infantry cast a total
vote of 470 of which Milliken received
300. Pluralities for the Republicans
who will send a solid delegation to
Congress were practically unchanged
from the figures of last night as were
the pluralities of Frederick Hale and
former Governor Bert M. Fernald,
who were elected to the United States
Senate. The Republicans who have
held a majority in the State Senate
will control both houses by a good
working majority. The revised vote
for Governor, United States Senators
and Congressmen follows:

National Issues to Front
Throughout the campaign in which
a great number of men from all parts
of the country, drawn trom Republi
cans, Democrats and Progressives,
participated, national issues were kept
to the front. The interest aroused, to
gether with perfect election weather,
brought out one of the biggest votes
ever cast in the State and possibly
greater than has been known before.
For the first time the two United
States Senators were elected by popu
lar vote. The Republicans made a
determined effort to win the one seat
in the Senate and the single seat in
the House of Representatives held by
Maine Democrats. The Democrats
had claimed the State by 3,000 and
the Republicans by 15,000.
The Legislature has been won by
the Republicans, v/ho now control the

Estate to His Family
By Associated Press
Philadelphia, Sept. 12.—The widow
and children of former Governor
Samuel W. Pennypacker, who died
September 2, will receive his estate,
estimated at $20,000 to $50,000. The
will, which was executed May 16 of
this year, was admitted to probate to
day at Norristown. In many respects
it fefiects the peculiar characteristics
of its author.
There is a clause bequeathing to
Josephine W. Pennypacker, a daugh
ter, a silver dollar which, it is ex
plained, was given the dead Governor
by his grandmother and which he
enrried in his pocket for fifty-five
years. "It is the one concrete thing
most closely associated with me per
sonally," the Governor wrote.
Deeoratio >s to Grandson
Mr. Pennypaeker's decoration as a
colonel in the G. A. R. t fashioned out
of a portion of captured cannon, and
several other decorations of other mili
tary organizations are awarded his
grandson, Samuel Whitaker Penny
packer, along with other personal
property.
His commissions as judge and Gov
ernor and other commissions and cer
tificates of membership in many so
cieties are given to his son, Bevan Au
brey Pennypacker, who will also re
ceive a Bible printed in 156 8, which
belonged to the grandfather of his
great-great-great-grandmother; the
Bible of his great-grandfather, Mat
tias Pennypacker; the Bible of his
great-grandfather, Samuel Adams; the
portrait of his great-grandfather,
Isaac Anderson; the oil portraits of his
grandfather and grandmother Whit
aker, the crayon portrait of his father,
the oil portrait of his mother, and the
oil portrait of himself; the silver lov
ing cup given to him by his military
staff also is left to his son.
To his daughters. Eliza Bromall
Pennypacker and Ann Maria Whit
aker the testator leaves the silver set
of 163 pieces ornamented with the
arms of the Pennypacker family given
to him by the heads of the depart
ments of the Commonwealth.
Want Home Preserved
The rest of his estate, real, personal
and mixed, is given to his widow for
life. Upon her death the executors
are directed to divide the estate into
four parts for the four children.
After empowering the executors to
sell the real estate, the testator de
clares: "It is my hope, but I do not
enjoin, that the home at Pennypack
ers Mills, with its appointments and
contents, be maintained and preserved
for my children."
The executors are the widow and
the son.
Twelve Miles of Soldiers
to Crowd Texas Roads in
Biggest Hike in 50 Years
San Antonio, Texas, Sept. 12. Au
tomobilists and others, who wish to
travel between San Antonio and Aus
tin on any of the eight days beginning
Saturday, September 16, would do well
to keep off the route selected by Gen
eral Funston for the big divisional
"hike," according to a warning sent
out from Southern Department head
quarters.
The marching National Guardsmen
and regulars will form a column 10 to
12 miles in length and vehicles will
have a hard time passing it.
Several features will distinguish the
"hike" from any other practice stunt
in American army history. It will be
the biggest on record with 663 officers,
13,410 enlisted men, and 5,750 animals
taking part. For the first time motor
transportation will ho used to supply
an army division. For the first time
since the Civil war a division will move
with complete divisional train equip
ment .
Five motor truck companies, a total
of 175 machines, will form the divi
sional trains. Two companies will
make up the supply train, two com
panies the ammunition train and one
company the engineer train. The sun
ply problem will be handled along the
lines worked out by the European
combatants. San Antonio will be the
base and throughout the 83-mlle
march to Austin, the three days' stay
there and the eight days' return trip,
the trucks will journey back to Sari
Antonio for all supplies except wood
water and hay.

RUNAWAY CAR
JUMPS OFFRAILS;
2 DEAD, 13 HURT
Trolley Operated by Green
N. Y. Strike-Breaker Crashes
Into Two Jitneys
FOUR MORE MAY DIE
Intermittent Rioting During
Night; Surface Lines Com
pletely Tied Up
New York, Sept. 12. The first
serious accident of the street railway
strike in this city occurred early to
day when a trolley car of the Union
Railway Company in the Bronx,
operated by a "green" motorman, got
beyond control on a steep grade and
jumping the track at a curve, crashed
into two jitney buses, killing two per
sons and severely injuring 13 others
Four of the injured may die. The
car crew was arrested pending in
vestigation.
After a night of intermittent riot
ing, motormen on the Sixth and Ninth
avenues elevated roads reported to
the police that they had been fired
upon by strikers from roof tops.
Third avenue elevated trains were re
peatedly bombarded with bricks and
stones from buildings. One passenger,
a woman, was struck on the head and
seriously injured. Five arrests were
made.
The congestion on the subways and
elevated roads to-day was even more
pronounced that yesterday, duo to the
fact that, there was little or no service
on the surface lines of Manhattan and
the Bronx. Not a car wheel moved in
West Chester, cities of Yonkers, Mt.
Vernon and New Rochelle. Union
leaders claim hundreds of subway and
elevated employes have joined the
union within the last 24 hours. Trac
tion officials maintain that all of their
employes who signed the "master and
servant contract" remained loyal.
Hugh Frayne, State organizer of
the American Federation of Labor in
sisted to-day that a general walk-out
by all labor unions was not being con
sidered. He said the present plans
of the leaders contemplated calling
out the unions closely allied to the
striking railroad men.
John T. Riley, chairman of the
International Longshoremen's Union,
declared that the members of his
organization, numbering between 8,-
000 and 10,000 are voting on the ad
visability of declaring a sympathetic
strike.
Attack Strike-breakers
Violence continued as the day went
on. Strikers and sympathizers halted
surface cars and set upon the crews of
strike-breakers when the latter refused
to deser! their posts.
Nearly one hundred strike-breakers,
most of them from Chicago and Bos
ton, appealed to Mayor Mitchel and
the Public Service Commission, claim
ing that none of the promises made
when they were engaged had been
kept and that they were virtually pris
oners in car barns. They alleged that
alleged guards prevented them from
leaving and that wages due them were
not forthcoming. The mayor promised
them police protection in their efforts
to collect wages.
Maennerchor Members to
Get Tiny Iron Crosses
From Deutschland Cargo
From the stout iron bolts that com
prised a part of the ballast of the Ger
man uijdersea liner Deutschland, the
first submarine that ever carried a
cargo across the Atlantic to America's
shores, tiny souvenir "iron crosses"
will be wrought for the members of
the Harrisburg Maennerchor.
Edward Moeslein, a former city
councilman, and well known in Ger
man-American circles throughout the
city, a noted firm of junk dealers and
Captain Paul Koenig and his intrepid
crew will make this possible. Here's
the story:
When the Deutschland nosed into
Baltimore It bore a cargo of nuts,
bolts and similar products in ballast.
Klaff &■ Co., the Junk dealing firm,
bought the stuff. James G. Hatz, a
local attorney, is resident counsel for
the firm and one of the traveling rep
resentatives to-day called at Mr. Hatz's
office and presented him with three
bolts as souvenirs.
Mr. Moeslein to-day was given a
counle of the bolts to present as sou
venirs to the local singing society. And
he declared he will have the iron
molded into tiny iron crosses.

changes are expected in the physical
department and the season will be
started on that date.
Says Germany Will Not
Unload Low-Priced Goods

Berlin, Sept. 11, via London, Sept
12. —The prospect of a "war after the
war," as proposed by British news
papers and discussed at the economic
conference of the. Allies at Paris ap
parently is causing little anxiety in
Germany, where l*ie belief is expressed
that natural commercial tendencies
will soon overcome any artificial bar
riers which may he erected.
This view was voiced in a statement
to the Associated Press to-day by
Phillip Hcineken, director of the North
German Lloyd Line. Herr Heineken
discussed plans being made in Ger

after tho coming of peace and said
there was no basis for apprehension

BRITISH VIOLATE
U.S. NEUTRALITY
Vigorous Protest Will Be Made
on Holding Up of Steamer
in Philippine Waters
By Associated Press
Washington, Sept. 12. Violation
of American neutrality by a British
torpedo boat which held up and ex
amined the Phillipino Steamer Cebu
within the territorUt waters of the
Philippines was reported to the War
Department to-day by Governor Gen
eral Harrison. The dispatch imme
diately was transmitted to the State
Department and will bo made the
subject of a vigorous protest to Great
Britain.
The incident occurred yesterday
one mile and a half off Carabao is
land. According to the report of the
steamer's master, Lieut. Bailes, com
manding H. M. S. Destroyer No. 2,
boarded the Cebu, made inquiries
about her passengers and took both
the ship's manifest and her passenger
list. Apparently the officer was
searching for a man named Bady,
who was not found.
On releasing the Cebu, the lieuten
ant made this no'.p on her log:
"Boarded at 3:50 a. m., 9-11-16,
examined and passed."
There has been more than one com
plaint about the activity of the
British vessels around the Philippines
and while Governor General Harri
son's report furnishes the basis for a
specific protest it is probable that
Great Britain will be called upon to
restrict the operations of her patroll
ing squadron generally In and near
the territorial waters of the islands.
INVESTIGATING
SPAN COLLAPSE
Accounts of Survivors of Que
bec Disaster and Spectators
at Variance; 11 Deaths
By Associated Press
Quebec. Sept. 12.—The St. Lawrence
Rridge Company and the Quebec
Bridge Commission are conducting a
joint investigation to-day into the col
lapse of the central span of the Quebec
cantilever bridge over the St. Law
rence river while it was being hoisted
into position. The death list remains
at eleven.
Accounts of survivors of the disaster
and spectators are at hopeless vari
ance, some holding that the span Itself
buckled first and others that the hoist
ing supports did not work uniformly,
thereby throwing too much strain on
the supports.
Will Start Work Again Soon
Engineers in charge of the construc
tion work said to-day that as soon as
the cause of the accident is ascertained
the work of either reconstructing a
new span or raising the collapsed one
would be immediately undertaken. It
was estimated the work will cost
$1,000,000.
The opening of the bridge, scheduled
for next Spring, has been indefinitely
postponed. Quebec harbor officials, on
iinding that the fallen span did not
block the ship channel, permitted to
day the resumption of navigation by
ocean-going vessels.

Border Commissioners
By Associated Press
New London, Conn., Sept. 12.
President Wilson to-day remained
near his sister, Mrs. Anne E. Howe, who
is critically ill here. His plans de
pended largely on the outcome of her
sickness. Early this morning it was
said that her condition was practically
unchanged.
The first news of the apparent Re
publican victory in Maine was received
by the President from the newspapers
this morning as members of his party
would not disturb him last night with
the word because of the illness of Mrs.
Howe. He would make no comment.
Arrangements were made for the
President to receive the members of
the American and Mexican joint com
mission on board the naval "yacht
Mayflower during the day. The May
flower, with Mr. Wilson on board was
anchored off Fort Trumbull, near
here, but launches carried hourly re
ports to the President regarding Mrs.
Howe's condition.

attending the President's sister Issued
the following bulletin:
"Mrs. Howe had a comfortable
night. Her condition remains about
the same."
This news was Immediately for
warded to the President on the May
flower. Soon afterwards, the Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilson came ashore and
went to Mrs. Howe's hotel. As they
walked through the main street of
New London, they were recognized by
many persons.
ALLIES EXERT
HEAVY PRESSURE
IN MACEDONIA
British Sweeping Along the
the Struma Northeast of
Saloniki
MAY BE GREAT DRIVE
Bulgarians in Flight After De
feat in Thirty-Six Hour
Battle
Reports from the Macedonian front
to-day point more strongly than ever
to the probability that the present
thrust of the entente forces may be
the long expected general offensive
movement from this base.
Of the armies of the five nations as
sembled on this front, reported from
some sources to number 600,000 men,
the British and French are known to
be exerting heavy pressure, the Brit
ish along the Struma front northeast
of Saloniki, and the French north
ward alons the Vardar on the Ser
bian border.
French troops also are co-operating
with the British in the more easterly
operation where like their allies they
have crossed the Struma, capturing the
village of Yenimah on the easterly
bank, within ten miles of Demir-His
sar. The British have seized addi
tional trenches across the river to the
southeast and according to a news
dispatch from Athens the Bulgarians
arc in retreat after a 36-hour battle
in which they suffered heavy losses.
West of the Vardar, near Majadag,
four miles south of Gievgeli, Paris re
ports a vigorous offensive by the
French and their allies, resulting in
the penetration of Bulgarian positions
to a depth of nearly half a mile on a
two-mile front.
Russians Advancing
The Russian campaign in the Car
pathians is making further progress,
according to Petrograd, which reports
the capture of Kapul mountain, near
the Bukowina border, and other
heights nearby. Berlin announces the
repulse of Russian attacks in this sec

In Macedonia the Bulgarians are
reported to have evacuated the forts
at Kavala which they occupied last
month, when they pushed their left
flank forward to the Aegean coast.
Guns of allied warships now domin

less to the Bulgarians, who are said
to have turned thetn over to the
