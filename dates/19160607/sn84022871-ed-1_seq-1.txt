The Flanders & Mossman garage is
one of the busiest places in town.
With the agency for the Buick, Over

force of seven men they are able to
report remarkable sales of cars. Up
to June 1 they report the sale of 52
cars and in the month of May alone
reported to the secretary of state the
sale of 34 automobiles. The big day of
the season was Monday, May 29,
when seven persons bought cars from
the Flanders & Mossman garage. A
driving story in which "Buster"
Erown of the garage played the hero
part is a 354 mile drive in one day. It
appears that a large Buick six was
sold to T. L. Bovine of Derby and on
June 1 Mr. Bovine desired to see what
the'car would do and Mr. Brown started
with the Bovine family that morning,
going to Montreal via Swanton and
returning on the same day. At the
journey's end the speedometer regist
ered 354 miles. Some of the recent
purchasers are William Cameron of

Rev. I. A. Rannet, Pastor
You aie cordially
invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
The morning subject was, "Waiting
for the Right Time." No one ever
undertakes anything which means the
betterment of humanity, who does not
encounter difficulties and discourage
ments, but these things if met in the
power of the Holy Spirit are our bless
ings, it you do not beJieve you are
big enough to do a thing you are
defeated before you strike a blow.
You must know the thing yovf at
tempt is right and have confidence in
your ability to do it. Then you must
be willing to work according to God's
plan. If you would achieve success,
with this must be a determination to
succeed at any cost except of honor,
and a faith which trusts God to lead to
victory in spite of any delays.
The evening service was an union
one, the sermon being preached by
Rev. W. A. Warner. Subject, "The
Coronation of the King." St. John
19 : 2,3. The crown of thorns is a
symbol of infinite love and power, and
the power symbolized in that crown is
the power instilled with perfect sub
mission to the will ot uod. We all
have ideals in life for which we are
willing to wear the crown of thorns.
Christ's ideal was summed up in these
words, "Not My will but Thine be
done," and from that submission came
His and comes our irresistible strength.
Ideals that dwell in the heart make our
lives. Our efforts and ideas all bend
toward that one ideal. It should be our ,
ideal to do our part more earnestly1
than we have, to bring the Kingdom
to men. Raphael, the Italian painter,
when asked how he painted so beauti
fully, replied, "I dream dreams and
see visions," and thus he painted.
Every earnest Christian, who reads
his Bible and looks lovingly at the
Christ sees visions and dreams dreams,
glimpses of what he himself may
become. We are in process of prep
aration for something larger and
better. If we don't accomplish all we
hope to, God will accept what we have,
and have some one to complete what
we have begun. Strive to realize the
heavenly vision, the King will be near
to help us.
Remember the food sale at the
church Saturday afternoon, under the
direction of the Woman's Alliance.
