It la predicted that Coleman Du-

tO.P. Convention Opens
With Noise, Crowds, Rain
By FERRY ARNOLD
(United Press SUE Correspondent)
CHICAOO, June 7.-Joatllng crowds
on Michigan, boulevard, the blare of
banAt, wriggling lines of densely pack
ed humanity n hotel lobbies, berth
hose and be-badged visitors, and the
buu, buxs of talk Ula waa the open'
lag day of the Republican and progres
slve national eoaveatloaa.
Much of the usual parading, etc., waa
toned down oa aeeouat of aa unexpect
ed dpwa poor of rain. But despite
xbla there were 16,000 delegates and
spectators at the Coliseum whose
hedges aad clothe were bedraggled
by parading through tho rata.
A eoaUattotu roar of Boise kept up
ft feroaooa, with Rooeevek aad
Kugaea aa tho iriBClpal topiea of poll
tloal eoaversatlea.
A( lout, these wore the outward
auatfeatlUtioaa of the ehosea few of
two aatioaal parties awetiag in solemn
oaekv to aame a presidential ticket.
,ear.. 'yeara' ago the steam roller
Mfcklita "garganUun" way through
CWeago's streets, down and through
he CoUaeum and hack Into the round
Meof polltlcalAUtory.
UHi stai roller had, not perform
ed; there would have bote), only oa
MUoaial ooaveaUoa' today, iut those
who were quashed by the pancake
making wheela of the Juggernaut arose,
brushed off their dusted garments and
assauged their" mangled bodies with
tho balm of convention, candidates and
machinery of their own.
It appeared today that the bruises
the steam roller of four years ago In
flicted might be entirely healed. The
republican man in the street and the
progressive man In tho street hailed
each other as brother, not a political
enemy.
Gono today was the bofore-tlio-battle
acrimony of four years ago, which cou
tered about the smallest mlnutae of
the convention machinery.
It may be said the leailors of the
progressive and republican gatherings
still maintain an air of aloofness mixed
with a curiosity aa to what the other
side was doing, but there waa not
nearly so much grim desperation in
the chase of the southern delegate,
tho. pursuit of the elusive unpledged
delegate or in the jockeying for placos
on the permanent roll of the conven
tion renter.
I The business scheduled in both na
tional gatherings is to be more or less
perfunctory today. Calling to order,
prayer, Introductory speecaee ay mo
