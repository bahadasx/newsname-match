1TERIIG SEA
BATTLE F
Between German and
British Battleships.
ABOUTTEN THOUSAND SEAMEN
And Many Officers Were Lost
In the First Naval Fight
Of the War.
HEAVY LOSSES OX BOTH SIDKS
London, June 2. Picking its way
from its base In the Kiel canal the
German high sea fleet on Wednes
day afternoon emerged into the
North Sea and off the coast of Jut
land engaged a British fleet through
out the afternoon and night in what
probably was the greatest naval bat
tle in the world's history so far as
tonnage engaged and tonnage de
stroyed was concerned.
Conflicting Statements.
London, June 3. Conflicting
claims continue to cloud the issue
of the great naval battle fought off
the Jutland Coast last Wednesday.
There is no such great disparity
'in losses as at first appeared in the
British and German reports, accord
ing to British Admlrallty officials,
who claim that later reports show
that two German battle cruisers
went down, while London announces
the receipt of a wireless dispatch
from Berlin carrying an admission
from the German Admlrallty that
another German "battle ship, in ad
dition to the Pommern, was sunk
Unofficial reports say the British lost
19 warships and the Germans 15.
The life loss is estimated at 10,000.
Berlin has issued no further state
ment regardlngnhe German losses,
whiclfi inltaliy.were Elven as one
battle ship, two light cruisers and
.several destroyers.
Losses Were Great.
London, June 4. The British Ad
mlrallty to-night Issued a statement
saying there was the strongest
grounds for the belief that the Brit
ish navy in the battle with the Ger
mans off Jutland last week had ac
counted for a total of eighteen Ger
man men of war, and that there was
nothing to add to or subtract from
the original announcement of the
British losses. The statement gave
the German losses as two battle
ships, two dreadnought battle cruis
ers, four light cruisers, nine torpedo
destroyers and a submarine.
The pessimism which prevailed as
a result of the Admlrallty's original
statement of losses, which now is
-considered to have been needlessly
candid and conservative In underes
timating the extent of the German
losses as compared with those of
Great Britain, has been greatly les
sened by the latest statement.
A dispatch from Copenhagen says
rumors are current in Hamburg that
two additional German warships
than those announced in the German
communication the battleship
Westfalen and the battle cruiser
Lutzow were sunk in the battle. A
wireless dispatch received here Sat
urday from Berlin said the German
Admlrallty admitted the loss ef the
Westfalen.
The Admlrallty statement to-night
declares that the German losses in
the fight were not only relatively,
but absolutely greater than those of
the British. Maintaining its prac
tice of caution, the Admlrallty still
refrains from giving the name3 of
the lost German ships.
Cause Of Fight.
London, June 4. The Danish
steamer Fjord, which arrived at
Frederikshaven to-day from Lelth,
was the real cause of the whole fight.
While steaming in the North Sea
Just off the northwest coast of Jut
land, she was stopped by a German
torpedo boat, whose chief came on
board and examined her papers.
Whilst this wag proceeding four
British destroyers were observed on
theliorlzon, coming toward the Ger
mans. The Gorman chief and bis
men hurried off to their torpedo
boattnd ' left at full speed. The
Fjord'' did the same. Within a few
minutes the British began tiring at
the German vessel and kept up the
chase for awhile. Later tho Fjord
passed four German cruisers and
thirty torpedo boats 'paoed by, fir
ing and steering at full speed in the
OUGHT
direction of tho battleships. The
Fjord heard the cannonading for
over four hours while going cast
around Skaw.

FRIEND OF CHILDREN'
DEAD AT AGE OF 102
Hickman, Ky., June 3. Noah
Swindle, the oldest man in Hickman,
and possibly 4hc oldest mini in the
county, died here last night sudden
ly. When he retired at 9:30 he was
apparently well, but at 'midnight his
aged wife discovered he was dead.
Mr Swindle was .102 years old, and
o;e of the most unique characters
the city has ever known, being unu
sually active, spending most of his
time playing with the small children
in the neighborhood, and speaking
to every child that came near. He
is survived by hlg'aged Avlfe, who Is
nearly 100 years old, several child
ren and grandchildren, all of the lat
ter residing elsewhere.
STOCKHOLDERS NOTIFIED
OF THEIR INDEBTEDNESS
Paris, Ky., June 3. Deputy State
Banking Commissioner Buckner
Woodford to-day mailed notices to
each of the stockholders of the de
funct George Alexander & Company
State Bank, calling attention to their
indebtedness, under the double lia
bility clause of the State laws, to
the creditors of the bank, and ask
ing for a settlement. The capital
stock of the Alexander bank was
$40,000, but Alexander, who Is now
insolvent, owned one-half of this
amount. As the stock In itself is
now valueless, according to the State
laws, the stockholders are liable for
$100, the par value of the stock, on
each share owned by them. It Is
thought about $18,000 will be added
to the assets of the bank through
this means.

CARDS SEEMJOJE STACKED
Against Nomination Of Roose
velt, But His Friends Are
Not Giving Up.
A SITUATION UNPRECEDENTED
(By Associated Press.)
Chicago, June 5. 'For some un
known reason for which no explana
tion Is offered, there Is a growing
Conviction among boh Republican
and Progressive leaders assembled
here for the national conventions
that Col. Roosevelt will not be nom
lnated by the older party, Among
those who hold to this view are
many numbered among the Colonel'3
closest friends, who none the less
are not giving up the fight.
The leaders who take this view
of the situation seem to think that
Justice Hughes is the man who
could bring the Republican and Pro
gressive parties together and present
a solid front to the Democratic op
position, even though they are not
convinced that the Justice can win
the nomination.
The situation which this condition
presents is unprecedented. None of
the leaders on the ground profess to
have any Idea of what will happen
It Is notable that all the speculation
so far has been principally among
the leaders, probably less than fifty
of them, and that the delegates have
had very little part in It. A few
more than half of the delegates to
the Republican convention have
reached Chicago." Those who are
here are uncertain of the attitude of
other men from their States.
It seems certain that Col. Roose
velt could have the Progressive nom
ination at once if he would say the
word and still leave the way open
to withdraw his candidacy If the Re
publican convention nominated a
man whom he was willing to sup
port.
One faction among the Progres
sives favors nominating CoS. Roose
velt on tho first day of the conven
tion and then await the action of
the Republicans. Another faction
would prefer to make no nomination
until after It was known what the
Republicans purposed to do."
On every hand there is speculation
as to what the Old Guard will do If
it succeeds in defeating Col. Roose
velt for the nomination; , whether
they would go the whole-' distance
and nominate a man of their num
ber, such as Root, Fairbanks, Weeks
or Burton; or whether they would
attempt to conciliate the Progres
sives by choosing jiinan whom the
latter might support. The name of
Justice Hughes Is the only one that
has boen brought forward so far as
having such possibilities.
Among the rank and file of the
Republicans there are Indications of
a genuine effort to draw the Pro
gressives back Into the old party.
One of these evidences I3 the lack of
harsh criticism and bellicose demon
strations which characterized tho
convention period of 1912. Appar
ently nil factions learned a lesson
from the disastrous consequences
following the split four years ago
and as a result nothing is hoard in
the way of brugaducio or defiance.
The supporters of candidates famil
iarly called favorite sons are firm in
their arguments, but are inclined to
a far greator degree than ordinarily
to extoll their candidates without
detracting from others.
Street-corner, harangues In tho
Interest of candidates and the usual
partisan musical demonstrations
have not been seen.
Because of tho fact that Justice
Hughes and Col. Roosevelt occupy
places far in advance of others in
the race, they have become the es
pecial subjects of attack, each by
tho champions of the other and both
by the adherents of the half dozen
or more other men whoso names are
being mentioned.

' Many Hardships.

On Ice Floes Terrific Blizzards
and Privations In a Sea
Of Ice.
ALL ARE REPOUTED AS SAVED
London, June 3. A long dispatch
from Lieut. Sir Ernest Shackelton,
who -has arrived at Port Stanley,
Falkland Islands, describes the mis
fortunes which overtook Ills Antarc
tic expedition. His ship, Endurance,
was pierced by icebergs and sank In
theXWeddell Sea on November 20,
bavins been abandoned by all hands
on October !27.
Shackelton and his crew reached
Elephant Inland on April 14 in boats
after a series of privations and suf
ferings In the drift Ice, several of
the party being then on the verge of
physical collapse.
As far as Is known not a single
man of the expedition lost his life,
but tho anxiety will not be at an end
until all tile men now marooned in
the South polar feglons have been
accounted for. Lieut. Shackelton's
story Is a narrative of conquest by
sheer courage and endurance of dif
ficulties as nearly Insurmountable as
ever a similar expedition encount
ered. Tho Endurance became wedged In
Ice floes, while bergs towered above
licr'ns though they might at any mo
ment overwhelm the vessel. For
wel&gon end the Endurance resist
ed the pressure, but by August it
was apparent she must bs crushed
into a mass of splinters. The parti'
was then forced to make camp on
one of the ice floes.
The little party of explorers found
themselves strangers In a frozen
world of their own. They were the
sole inhabitants of the field of ice.
Their only'sustenance was the small
supply of provisions taken from the
lost ship before she was abandoned,
and their only hope of safety was
residing in three small boats. Days
of danger followed. An attempt to
escape was foiled after a period of
fruitless effort. "At times," says
Shackelton, "tho various units were
Isolated on separate flees."
There was nothing to be done but
to retreat and await developments.
"Patience Camp" was set up, and
there these solitary men passed Feb
ruary and March of last year, slow
ly drifting north. Winter descend
ed on them. They saw tho the de
sired land at times, but could not
reach it. At length the floe on
which they were imprisoned split in
pieces under the Influence of the
swell, nnd tho marooned men had to
take to their frail boats.
Another floo was selected for a
night's rest, but It broke up under
their tent. Then 'came a period of
arduous boat work. The party was
threatened by wind, sea and ice un
til, after many days and worn out by
hardships, they arrived at Elrphant
Island on April 11. A gale wa
blowing, as though tho elements had
determined that no man should
reach" safety. But the haven was
eventually won.
The haven was merely an Ice
bound, storm-swept spot In a land of
desolation, but even this sanctuary
was welcomo to the explorers, who
had found It no easy matter to sup
port life. Then, owing to a shortage
of food, Lieut. Shackelton determin
ed to endeavor to breik through to
the known world. With a few of his
companions, not too exhausted to
undertake such further exertion
nnd hardships, as the effort promised
Shackelton braved tho obstacles
and by sheer pluck, resourco nnd
hard work won his end. reaching tho
head of King Haakon Bay. On May

South Gonr?la, the Interior of which

In Its report to State Auditor
Greene the board said it accepted
without change the assessments of
thirty-six counties and made raises
of from 2 to 25 per cent. In eighty
four. Of this number nineteen ac
cepted the raise without protest.
The board reported that It did not
reduco the assessment of any coun
ty. It stated that County Judges, ap
pearing before tho board, were
urged to appoint as supervisors only
such men as would help secure a
proper assessment and to join with
this board In an effort to reduce the
tax rates and equalize the burden of
taxation by requiring every person
to assess his property at Its fair cash
value.
To fcthe County Assessors the
board sent a letter calling attention
to the requirements of tho law nnd
the oath they take, and stating:
"The Board of Equalization has be
come convinced that if tho laws aro
literally enforced by tho assessors
the burden of taxation can bo prop
erly equalized and the tax rate of
counties, cities and tho State mate
rially reduced.
"The Constitution and the stat
utes require you to assess all proper
ty, except such as Is exempt from
taxation, at tho fair cash value of
such property. -The tax laws aro
sufficient, If enforced uniformly
throughout the State, to produce nil
tho 'revenue to support the city,
county nnd State governments ou a
rate much lower than tho present
rate. This uniform assessment can
be obtained only through the co-operation
of tho Assessors. We urge
you to Join this board In an offort to
reduco the tax rato nud equillze the
burden of taxation by requiring ev
ery person to nssesshls property at
Its fair cash valuo."
Virtue Is its own reward, so It's
no wonder a man hates to bo known
