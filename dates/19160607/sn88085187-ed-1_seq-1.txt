Why is ,i favorile son?
'' Also, WHO in (he mischief is be.
W1... is Henry 11. IM a brook? Nobody knows!
W1... is T. Coleman DuPont? Something- lo do
wilb Delaware, I think. Or is it Rhode Island?
Who is .1,,!,n W. Weeks? Somebody told me
be ran for office somewhere once, but I've forgot
ten what i| was.
Who Is this in,'it they call Hriiiiiliaugh, or some
thing like that. I heard a man say he used in he
mayor of Philadelphia.
Who is \V. J. Chlliouii? Echo answers "Who," and (hat ttillt
sail and walling voice.
Who are all these other candidates that have been dragged
from .. fathomless obscurity to be thrust by main strength upon
k,sy 'i 1., i imi attention?
And why on earth do they ania/.e us thus with their headquar-
L 9 i ters that bloom over night and their gabbing press agents and the
B lively chirrup of their otlier hired men?
* Presidential candidates they call them. There Isn't one of them
that liy any possibility COULD be nominated! There isn't one of
them about whom tbe country knows a .stricken thing or cares a
hoot, or could be made to rare.
Well, then, how do they get into tbe game?
y' And what's the use of all this vast expenditure of money and
law power gone to waste?
And now we come to a national convention as IT HEAL
-I,V IS, and not as it Is coutinually being piiint.-.l and dolled
up for (be delight of the popiib.ee.
All these sparrow birds of so-called candidates
are allowed to chiller and chatter around at a time
like this i.fci'uae each of them is to politicians
something to deal with. He is MATERIAL, this
IS favorite son; he Is STOCK, he is GOODS, be is the
equivalent of chips, pawns, long green or ready
ninziiniH.
ANI) THAT IS WHY HE IS A FAVORITE
When the gentlemen that sit behind the scenes
and pull tin' strings get ready to pick the man that
the convention is to nominate, they trade the votes of their respec
tive candidates against the advantages they want to get for them
selves, and out of this agreeable merchandising comes at last PEACE,
HARMONY and the LONG POLE that knocks the persimmon!
}•*. Nothing is easier than for a politician who knows his job to get
pawns of this Kind to deal with. There Is nearly always somebody
,^,ln his state who has both money and an overweening vanity—and
that is all that Is required.
"Grandpa was a candidate for the republican nomination for
president ln mill," he knows his admiring descendants will say, and
if he only gets eight votes that is enough!
' When It comes to the show-down time, the terms are the
BLI'NTEST AND PLAINEST.
All is done behind closed and watched doors, and there is no
-**• danger the hoi bolloi will hear anything, so what's the odds? Let's
talk right out.
1 have fourteen votes in the convention for .lohn W. Wooden
head, the favorite son of Goss Hollow. You want me to turn them
over to A. B. Solemnowl.
(Well, on what arrangement? Do I get to name the secretary
of commerce and the attorney general?
Also, of course, it must be all right for me about the patronage
...in my state. I get, the collector of the port and Hie big post offices.
In this way an understanding Is reached, agreeable to
all, and the favorite son disappears, in the shuffle.
p Then the delegates get the straight tip, the
•Igln man is nominated amid Indescribable enthu
dasm. and five million citizens are delighted with
he result of the convention's deliberations.
This ISN'T cynical, though to the uninitiated
t may sound so. It is merely fact, and every man
hat has "covered" national conventions with his
nind (as well ss his pencil) knows that it is fact.
There Is, Indeed, even something to be said lor
his method of picking our candidates.
/It is businesslike, practical, avoids any sentiment and maintains
among us the politicians, an American product that some philoso
phers would certainly regre^ to miss!

SURPRISE
FOR MRS.

This was a real surprise
party.
The most astonished per
son In the city last night
when it was learned that
Frederic Mottet had been
elected a member of the Met
ropolitan park hoard was
Mrs. Mottet.
-Cntil some time after !) o'clock
last night Mrs. .Mottet had not the
faintest Inkling that her husband
was even a candidate for the city
position.
When the returns were all ln
and he "fessed up," her face was
a puzzle.
Mrs. Mottet has been in ill
health for years, and the new
park commissioner has been keep
ing his candidacy from her for
fear she might worry over the
outcome.
But during the campaign the
little surprise party kept Mottet
on the hop, skip and jump head
ing off telephone calls to his
apartments.
As late as last evening he
scented danger when Jie phone
bell rang and somebody wanted
to know about a voting place.
Well, anyway, he's elected and
everything Is happy In the Mottet
family.
Question is, what would hubby
have said if the vote had gone
the other way?

CHICAGO, June 7. —
Roosevelt was made the fa
vorite In the betting for the
republican presidential nom
ination today.
The colonel's chance*, were
quoted at even money.
Hughes was second choice,
with six to five odds.
Root's .Mbis were five to
one; Hurton six to one;
Cummins and Weeks, seven
to one.
A dull, rainy day and a rain
soaked assemblage handicapped
the gathering of the republican
national convention today.
The weather plainly dampened
the enthusiasm of the delegates
who quieted down at 11:30 when
Ilill.-s pounded for order.
Harding, in delivering tbe key
note address, drew the first genu
ine spontaneous applause when be
pleaded for a navy that would
fear none In the world. Cheers
also greeted his declaration that
America should not be too proud
to fight.
The session adjourned without
any signs of an agreement upon
a candidate. Roosevelt, Hughes,
tlie native sons and the possibili
ties of a darw horse still hold
sway.
The attempt to get together
with the progressives seemed cer

appointment of a committee to

Americanism was the keynote,
and party unity was appealed for
In Harding's speech formally
opening the convention.
Harding's thrust at the demo
crats for "variability from Balti
more to Vera Cruz" brought huge
roars of laughter and applause.
As the sharp, Ironic shafts ram
med home, tbe laughter and In.ml
ripping frequently interrupted
the speech. The Ohio delegation
was especially strong for the ap
plause.
Harding spoke for an hour nnd
10 minutes. He then recognized
Chairman lillles, who presented a
temporary roll of officers for the
convention.
Sen. Llppltt of Rhode Island
presented the usual resolution
for the adoption of the rules of
the 1908 convention. A motion
was made for the appointment of
a committee for permanent or
ganization.
The doors of the Coliseum were
opened at 9 o'clock. Several hun

the rain thankfully slid inside.
More than 300 policemen and
scores of plain clothes men werfr

No Amalgamation.
Hllles arrived at- 10 o'clock and
looked over the hall. , There wei-o
only about 300 persons present.
The lights were turned on, giving
the l.arnllke structure a greenish
look. Two Kansas delegates were
the first to arrive, and they sat
lonesomely among the empty
chairs. Countless American flags
hung everywhere.
Oldtimers said the desolate ap
pearance and dampened atmos
phere was almost without parallel.

gun his Roosevelt keynote speec'i
when a violent Roosevelt demon-
stration started. At the first
mention of the colonel's name,
the, delegates cheered, yelled,
jumped Into tho air and waved
banners.
A huge banner was seized and
carried to the stage. Within a
minute practically every state
banner was planted In a cluster
on the speaker's stand.
Robin* named the colonel as
the "bravest and wisest leader it
the, people of our time and the
foremost leader Of the citizen
wotld."
'fThe nation is clamoring for
one mall, and that man is Roose
velt," he declared. He said they
wanted the nation's favorite son
and not a state's favorite son.

Not only did The Times
scoop the town yesterday on
tbe biggest telegraph story
of the day—the death of
Lord Kitchener —by pulling
out an extra long ahead of
the other papers' extras, but
In Its home edition It print
ed EXCLI SIVELY the big
gest local story of the last
two months.
This was the news regard
ing the movement to oust
.hunt's C. Drake from the of
fice of city commissioner.
If you want tbe news when
it is news READ THK
TIMES.
A movement to force Coin
niisslunei' James ('. Drake
from the city council gained
further headway today when
Herman Merlin, a North End
grocer of long-lhiM- residence
in 'racoon., laid uffldavils of
charges before Hit. niiiniii-
sionei' and suggested that be
Martin's action was merely
preliminary to a demand for im
peachment proceedings against
the commissioner, It was report-
When asked whether Martin
had appeared before him, Drake
said:
"I don't know Mr. Martin. No,
I don't believe 1 have seen him to
day."
I', .-p....'.1 Hy Harmon.
The nature of tbe charges waa
not divulged. They were prepar
ed in affidavit form by City At
torney U. E. Harmon.
Mayor Fawcett said that he ex
pected to be presented a copy of
the charges cither today or to
morrow.
"The charter provides?, that~l
must put these charges before the
council and allow that body to
call for an Impeachment proceed
ing," said Hie mayor. "I am
ready to present the affidavits as
soon as I receive them."

A crowd of spectators that
packed the council chambers to
its capacity attended today's
meeting, anticipating a rupture
between Drake and the other
eouncllmen. They were disap
pointed.
The only reference to lhe pend
ing shake-up was made by May
or Fawcett at tha conclusion ot
the session.
"When the new commissioners
took office a month ago, 1 an
nounced that on this date I would
ask for a change ln the comnils
slonershlps," said Fawcett.
' "Mr. Gronen, however. Is un
willing to move from nls present
position to that of tbe department
of light and water, and I will hold
the matter up temporarily."
Later the mayor said that lis
believed the new course cf events
would be fully as satisfactory.
"Fully $2,400 a month is
wasted on surperfloua salaries In
the light and water department,
and I can prove It," he said.
"Mr. Drake has refused to
make any cuts. I would like to
see Mr. Gronen In that depart
ment, but 1 believe some other
equally competent man can bo
found."
itUilt SJI.I..ISI.S,—S.
Commissioner Pettlt today de
clared that he had no desire to
"mix up in the Drake muddle." .
"When the matter first came
up, I told others that I arould not
vote to impeach Mr. Drake until
ths city attorney had given me
advice that the evidence against
the commissioner waa of an Im
peachable nature." he said.
Commissioner Gronen wss un
willing to talk about the proposed
ousting «I Drake. Hs declared,
however, that he wonld not fa
vor at this time being made the
light and water commissioner.
