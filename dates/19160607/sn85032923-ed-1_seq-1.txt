CHICAGO, June 5. Represen
tatives of several candidates for
the Republican presidential nomi
nation are in a perplexing pre
dicament. Having fostered sen
timent in favor of Hughes until
they felt sure Roosevelt was defin- I
itely eliminated they now fear
they cannot control Hughes, j
candidacy which has assumed the i
proportions of a boom. Efforts
are being made to concentrate
all elements against it. Indica- j
tions are the vote cf the Pro- i
grcssive party, wnich means
Roosevelt's disapproval of Hughes
will be sought as a check
Leaders desire harmony. They I
recognize that unless Republicans !
and Progressives combine, their j
chances for victory will be slim, j
To obtain harmony Republican i
leaders are willing to concede to
Rocsevclt the vote power in some
form. Some say he should be j
willing to select one or two men
acceptable to him from the list
of candidates.
