Gossip Says Conference Commit
tees Nay Be Appointed to Bring
About Enduring Peace
(By Associated Press.)
CHICAGO, June 7. As tin Republican and Progressive conven
tions assembled this morning there was no outward evidence of any
marked change in the situation. Overnight conferences among the
leaders failed to develop any definite plan by which they could agree
on a candidate who would receive the undivided support of both fac
tions, but there is talk of peace in the air. One proposal to have both
conventions appoint conference committees is being discussed and
some Republicans persisted in their predictions that ultimately there
will he harmony of action in some way.
After two hours and a half meeting the Republicans adjourned
until eleven tomorrow. Col. Harding spoke about an hour, during
m hii'h his speech was punctuated with cheers and his sallies against
(lie Democratic administration were received with laughter.
Talk of harmony has continued and the indications are that the
Republican convention is considering appointing a conference com
mittee to talk with the Progressives in the hope of finding a compro
mise, ground.
