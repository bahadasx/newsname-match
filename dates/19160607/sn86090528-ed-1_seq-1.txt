"Any movement booming
Justice Hughes for the nomi

almost Identical disclaimers.

Chicago, June 7. Jostling crowds

' boned and be-badged visitors, aim the
buzz, buzz of talk this was the open
ius day of the Republican mid Pro

At least, these were the outward j
manifestations of the chosen few of''
two national parties meeting in sol-
cum, conclave to mime a presidential
ticket.
Four years ago the steam v roller
stalked its Gargantuan way through
Chicago's streets, down and tlirough
the Coliseum and hack into the round
house of political history. .
If the steam-roller hadn't perform

bodies with the. balm of a convention,

very own.
it appeared today that the bruises'
the steam-roller of four years ago in

Progressive man in

each other as brothe

UP AGAINST HUGHES
Hitchcock Claims 345 Votes on First
Ballot; Fighting Spirit Missing and
Compromise With Moose
Still Sought
By United Press,
Chicago, III., June 7. The Republi
can hordes met this morning in a
damp, muggy atmosphere in their
fiuadrennial conclave in the Coliseum
with about as much idea as to whom
they will nc-.' ... as the uncertain
elements outside. II was raining and
the hall smelled of moth balls from
hastily exhumed winter raincoats and
damp clothing.
The buzz-buzz of 11 thousand veins
of cnnvornat.'on arose and was thrown
buck from the distant caverns of the
concave roof, Somewhere high up in
i.he gaunt steel rafters . a persistent
bund played soggy ragtime with an oc
casional strident no'e piercing and
drowning the huh-bub mr-' below.
Today's session of the convention
will be short, consisting mainly of
Chairman Harding's,' unynote speech,
preparation of the temporary roll call
and the announcement of comiMti'.ee
.appointments..
The following claims
for the vari
ous candidates m 'he first .allot were
current this tjiorning: Fairbanks 100,
Burton U'O, Weeks 175, Sherman 70,
Root 8"i. Dupont S, Borah l"i, Cummins
110, LaFollette 50, Roosevelt 70.
The total m-mber of votes in the
convention is 781, Frank Hitchcock
still claimed over 315 votes for Hughes
on the first ballot. The line-up, how
ever, appears to give Hughes only 210
on the first ballot.
Convenes at 11 :28.
Chairman Hilles pounded for order
at 11:28 and at 11:;!:! he presented
Rev. John T. Stone, of Chicago, who
pronounced the invocation.
As the crowd of fifteen thousand
wilted inward, there seemed to be a
distinct line-up of the favorite sons
against Hughes.
Sub-committees will prepare the
platform tonight and present it tomor
row. Senator Borah will propose uni
versal military training as one of the
planks. The platform is expected to
contain most of Roosevelt's American
demands and also a suffrage plank.
. Senator Borah eliminated himself
as u candidate for president this morn
ing. He offered to allow Roosevelt to
dictate the platform if the latter would
support Hughes.
The fighting spirit is absent among
the delegates.
