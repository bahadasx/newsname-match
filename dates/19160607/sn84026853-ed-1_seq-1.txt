Berlin, Jane 5.?An authoritative
account of the North Sea battle issued
here gives the first detailed
pieture of the progress of the great
engagement between the German
High sea fleet and that of the British.
Many details are suppressed for strategic
easons. The recital, however,
m^ets clearly what is characterized
as the British attempt to explain |
defeat by the statement that the[
German sea forces were mucb larger ?
than those which the British were j
able to bring into play.
This account declares explicitly
that twenty-six of Admiral Jellicoe's
most powerful battleships, including
six of the most modern Queen Elizabeth
class and the entire British flying.
wng composed of battle cruisers
equal in every respect except armor
protection, to dreadnaughts, were
engaged in all but the early stage of
the day battle.
Naval experts have intimated . to
the Associated Press that this was
one of the most decisive factors in ,
the. struggle.

GREATLY SHOCKED
Report of Admiralty on Naral Battle
Disappointing to the People In
General.
i ?H
London, June 2.?The British publie
was given a painful shock tonight
when the admiralty gave out a
statement that in a naval battle in
the North Sea Wednesday afternoon
the British battle cruiser fleet met
the German fleet, with the result that
three British battle cruisers were
rank, together with three cruiser*
and eight destroyers.
The Indefatigable, the Invincible
and the Queen. Mary were the battle
cruisers sent to the bottom by the
Germans. The cruisers Defence,
Black Prince and Warrior also were
lost. The Warrior first was reported
disabled/but subsequently it was announced
that rite had to be abandoned
by her crew.

through the afternoon and the following
night. The German fleet's losses
are stated to have been serious, bnt
no very definite information of- these
losses'is afforded* One battle cruiser
is declared to have been destroyed,
one disabled and another severely
damaged, while the belief is expressed
that a large number of German
destrojrera, were disposed of.
* Following quicfchfupon the admiralty
announcement'came the' German
official"version-o#*4toa light*-which-ii*
general confirmed 'the British account,
but carried the claim that the
battleship; Warspite also was sunk
and other British battleships damaged.
\
T>io Gorman InniM. Meordinff to
the German version of the battle,
were the small cruiser Wiesbaden,
rank by gunfire, and the warship'
Pommern by a torpedo, while the
cruiser Frauenlob and a number of
torpedo boats are missing.
The news was flashed in special editions
of the evening newspapers and
caused greater consternation in the
West End of London than has been
witnessed on any previous occasion
since the declaration of war. The
frankness of the admiralty annoucement
concerning the serious r?ture
of the British losses and the apparently
small losses of the Germans in
comparison led to the assumption in
most minds that the British vessels
