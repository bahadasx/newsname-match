(BY PKR11V ARNOLD.) j
Coliseum. Chicago. June . Under i
the handicap of a drab, dull day, with ;
u rain soaked assemblage, the Repub
lican national convention got under
way today. The weather was plainly
on the nerves of the crowd that quiet- j

Hilles' navel fell, twenty-eight minutes j
after the time set.
It was not until fter Temporary !
Chairman Harding had gotten well j
alone in his keynote speech that tne
air really warmed up. The Ohioan,
reputed to be one of the handsomest
men in the country and a polished
speaker, drew the first old fashioned
hali-rocking applause when, having :

Vtmosphere Chillv. ! But this was not tne onI ""ory
. . ..., i for the elder Kirkpatrick and his
was wet and cold, sneezing with ap
proaching colds and uncomfortable in
the musty atmosphere of the hall. He
got a politely gracious reception but
as h.s polished phrases sunk into the
audience, he gradually warmed the
air. The 15,000 began to forget their
rniffles, their oold feet and wet
clothes.
The Republicans convened without
any sign of any sort of agreement on
the candidate whom they will select. It
was still Hughes and Roosevelt and
Burton and Fairbanks and all the rest,
with nobody knowing exactly what
would happen. There was no doubt
that the il, O. P. convention was
mightily interested in what was hap-I
pening and about to happen at the
Auditorium, where those who broke
the bonds four years ago, were holding
a conference.
That there would be an attempt for
a "get together" meeting of commit
tees of both conventions was certain.
At least one resolution was to be in
troduced suggesting a combination of
intertsts. This was the one fathered
by the New Jersey delegation, asking
that a committee be appointed to ad
vise the Progressives as to Republi
cans' plans for a platform. This is
the scheme advanced by Edward
Brennan of Jersey City.
Waiting In Rain.
Doors to the Coliseum were opened
at 9 o'clock and at that early hour
there were several hundred bravely
waiting in the rain who thankfully
slid into their places. Three hundred
uniformed policemen under Chief
Healey's personal direction were on ;
duty, with several score additional
piainciones men. As a matter of fact, '
i or me next nour. tne convention hall
looked like an assemblage of blue
coats. Chairman Hilles dressed soberly in
a dark cutaway suit, arrived at 10
o'clock and he and Sergeant-at-Arms
Stone came out on the front rostrum
for a brief look over the hall, then
holding only 300 or 400 peo
ple. The hall was so dark that some
of the lights across the great dome of
the hall were turned on. In this yel
low light and the faint blue-gray of
the dark day without, the hall looked
greenish-gray. .
Kansans First.
The first delegates to arrive were
two from Kansas. They looked lone
some sitting in the forest of chairs ar
ranged in nice rows on the floor.
Over the speaker's rostrum was
hung a gigantic sounding board of
wood and paper mache. Back of the
great platform proper, high up over
all, the likeness of Abraham Lincoln
looked down from a frame brilliantly
illuminated by electric lights.
Above this was the president's flag,
blue with the great seal of the United
States standing out brilliantly in the

( By State Journal Staff Correspon

Chicago, June 7. Kansas delegates
went Into the opening session of the
Republican national convention today
with, their minds still muddled as to
the final turn which they may make
in the fight for the presidency. Al
most ev3ry delegate admitted that a
scrtous situation faced the party.
Every delegate quietly told his friends
he was on the look-out for subma
rines. But at the opening of the bis
show, there was a tendency among
Kansas president makers to distribute
their votes and a centralization of bal
lots is not expected until some can
didate shows a probable winning
streak.
Anti Hughes delegates on the Kan
sas delegation will probably continue
firm, although the Hughes boosters
were today claiming at least an even
dozen sunflower votes after the first
few ballots. On the other hand the
Allies were confident they would
shake the Hughes following unless the
justice showed some tin expected
strength. Unless Hughes goes into
the fight in third speed, his opponents
on the Kansas delegation will try to
grab a few of his delegates after the
first three or four ballots. To hold
his strength away from the Root-Burton-Weeks-Fairbanks-Sherman
combi
nation, Hughes must keep up a full
head of steam on every ballot.
No Dark Horse Talk.
There is little talk among the Kan
sas delegates of dark horse candi
dates. They admit that the probable
action of Roosevelt aa affecting the
nominee of the Republican convention
is a really grave matter. None of the
Kansas delegates, however, have come
out in the open for the colonel. At a
caucus of the delegates, it is reported,
though, that several of the delegates
signified a willingness to support the
colonel if the state delegation should
line up for him. But that doesn't
change things greatly. The men who
really claim to know things about
those twenty delegates sleep soundly
in the belief that they will never, nay
never, go to Roosevelt.
Urge a Split Vote.
Two conferences of the Kansas dele
gates were held late Tuesday afternoon
and Tuesday night. Another confer
ence this evening is probable. The

Old Guard Still Has Situation

Senator Borah Eliminates Him

(BY PERRY ARNOLD.)
Chicago. June 7. The hosts of Re
publicanism met in quadrennial ses
sion today with about as much knowl
edge of who they would choose some
time this week as a presidential nomi
nee as Noah had about the probable
duration of the deluge. The simile
is eminently fitted for outside the
great Coliseum, full drab skies tpat
a ceaseless downpour of cold rain, just
as they had been giving vent to their
feelings since yesterday morning.
Today's session was to be merely .a
transfer of talk from the hotel lobbies
to the Coliseum. The program was to
meet, listen to a keynote speech by
Temporary Chairman Warren G.
Harding; receive and accept the tem
porary roll of delegates; announce the
convention committees and adjourn
for more talk in hotel lobbies and
rooms.
Talk Getting on Nerves.
Thts talk part of this convention is
getting on the nerves of the delegates.
Maybe two days of depressing Chicago
rain, "fog and wind aided. But the
fact remains today that of the mil
libns of words, of conversation, con
ference and conflict, not a syllable has
yet been transferred to concrete ac
tion. Murray Crane whispered again
today; George Perkins conferred;
favorite sons talked; Frank Hitch
cock moved about with mysterious
words trailing along in his wake;
Boise Penrose listened to talk; Barnes
gave a few chosen words then became
a receptive well cf conversation; the
lobby crowds talked.
Out of the waste of words, it was
possible to develop any hypothesis and
arrive at any decision, according to
the wish of the listener. A modern
Diogenes, however, would probably
have sifted out the following salient
facts from the talk of the convention
leaders:
Old Guard Holds Reins.
The Old Guard still has tbe situation
well in hand.
It is playing a chord of harmony,
being real pleasant and nice with its
power.
Hughes will have a good lead on the
first ballot.
The allies have figures to support
their claim that combined against
Hughes, they have more than three
times the number of delegates credited
to the justice. ,
Senator Borah of Idaho, eliminated
himself as a presidential possibility.

Mrs. Goodnight was found in the
cellar dead, having been carried from
her bedroom on the second floor to
the basement. Her head was crushed
in the same manner as the other vic

instantly.
Officers were puzzled early today as
to the motkve of the crime and the
identity of the slayer. Althougn the
sheriffs and city marshal's depart

case it was said that nothing could be
ascertained until Mrs. Morau regained
consciousness and related her story of
the attack on the aged couple and her
self. As far as known here no person had
any grievances against the Goodnight
family and it had been almost defi
nitely established that robbery was not

Chicago, June 7. Every prepared-
ness and "Americanism" plank that
Colonel Roosevelt has espoused in th
past year is to be included along withr
woman suffrage and labor reform
planks of the Progressive party. f
William Allen White, member
the Progressive resolutions commit-
tee from Kansas, and Dean Walter
Lewis, of the department of law of the!
University of Pennsylvania, have com-
pleted a preliminary draft of the plat
form, largely under Colonel Roose-f
velt's direction. 4
The platform is understood to in
elude the following planks:
Preparedneits, including universal
service and a great navy.
Americanism, with ftnitbaxi on nee

National woman suffrage. '
Improvement of labor conditions
