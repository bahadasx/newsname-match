PF.ACI2 TO ItKPI' IJI.IC
WASHINGTON. June ?.?A cable
gram to the state Department to-day
from American Minister Keinseh. at
Peking, announced the death of Yuan
j Shi Kai, President of China.
i The minister's message, dated at
! Peking at 31 A. M. to-day, suid Yuan j
j died last night, and that Premier Tuan
Chi Jul had announced that be would
give his full support to the Vice
President. Li Yuan Hung. No details
? *>f the President's death were given,
jand no mention made of the widely
circulated and officially denied reports
'that he bad been poisoned.
It is generally believed here that
the accession of I.i Yuan Hung to the
presidency will make possible early
; restoration of order in China, and bring
the revolting and loyal provinces to
gether. I.i is thoroughly imbued with
republican ideas, and is declared to bo
one of the most popular men in China,
because he has abstained from fac
: tional quarrels, and has a reputation
j for hiph integrity.
Yuan Shi Kal was reported to have
. been taken seriously ill on May 2S.
At that time dispatches from China
said it was believed in Peking that the
j President had been poisoned, but this
report was denied by the Chinese am
; bassador at Washington, who insisted
the President was not even ill.
Yuan Shi Kai died while the storm
of revolution was gatlierin?r in increas
ing strength. The revolt broke, out in
December, 1015, when the President an
nounced his intention of establishing
a monarchy and ascending the throne
as the first Emperor of a new dynasty.
His coronation was set for early in
February of this year, hut was post
poned indefinitely, owing to the ex
traordinary rapidity with which the
revolt spread through Southern China.
Several attempts were made upon the
President's life, and a bomb plot was
i discovered in the imperial palace. The
i establishing of a monarchy was stre.n
I uotisly opposed by Japan, and its final
abandonment was largely credited to
I the representations mado by Tokyo.

The Germans are directing their ef
forts inward bringing up masses of
re-enforcements through the ravines
between Vaux and Damloup.
Although two infantry attacks were
made yesterday, they lacked the In.
tensity of the previous rushes. The
conclusion is drawn that the heavy
recent losses of the Germans are com
pelling them to proceed less vigorously
while they are. re-forming their units.

No change has been recorded nt the
