PROGRESSIVES MEET
Delegates Gather Slowly
Nomination of Colonel
Is Postponed.
Anditorinm. June 7 With tn
mnltnuns demonstrations for The
odore Roosevelt, tho prneressive
national convention opened here
today while the republican na
tional convention was in progress
in the Coliseum. F.nthnsiasm for
Roosevelt became almost rioutous
when Raymond Robins of Chicago,
the temporary chairman of the
contention, referred to him as
"foremost citizen of the world."'
Oyster Bay. T Jane 7.
WhDe Colonel Roosevelt refrains
from making any public statement
those close to him say his real at
titude on the convention is well
known to his intimates here, that
he is opposed to the nomination of
Jnstice Hnghes and it is their con
fidential helief that if uiiirhes is
nominated Colonel Roosevelt will
himself become a candidate.
Colonel Roosevelt, it is well under-
pinou, lb not ax ijdusneu w iuj jus-
tire Hughes so-called "flag speech,"
which he is said to regard as merely a!
Fourth of July address, having no
value at all as showing the justice's!
attitude on the real issues of the day. j
In the words of his followers bore, the !
colonel regards the -s-pepch as further j
"evidence of pussy footing" to which
attitude he is opposed in the present
crisis in the country's affairs. His fol
lowers look for a broadside from him
in a day or two which they say would
be calculated to eliminate Hughes and
any other candidate whom the colonel
regards as representing the "pussy
foot idea."
"The colonel feels," they say, "that
if the republicans have made up their
minds to nominate a man representing
this idea, the one thing left for him to
do is to run himself in order to bring
before the people the issue of "straight
forward Americanism.
Progressives Assemble.
Auditorium, Convention Hall, Chi
cago, June 7. Delegates and guests of
the progressive convention arrived
Blowly for the opening of the conven
tion at 12 o'clock.
Reports that there might be an in
sistent demand for immediate nomina
tion of Colonel Roosevelt were dis
couraged in a statement by Georee W.
Perkins, confidential spokesman for the
party, who declared the progressives
were meeting in a conciliatory spirit
and would not act precipitately, while
the possibility of agreement with the
republicans remained.
Postpone T. R. omination.
Mr. Perkins was asked if Colonel
Roosevelt would be nominated today.
"There is not a chance," he replied.
"We are not going to take any snap
Judgment."
Mr. Perkins said a telephone con
versation he had with Colonel Roose
velt this morning was devoted almost
entirely to the bad weather here and
at Oyster Bay. Neither of them, said
Mr. Perkins, regarded the weather as
an ill omen. Mr. Roosevelt will be
kept in close touch with developments
in the progressive convention by long
distance phone, but the Oyster Ray
wire will not be strung directly to the
convention.
Sine "Teddy" Soncrs.
Over the walls of the huge audito
rium were pinned copies of "Teddy"
songs to be sung by delegates, the
ones including "When Teddy Comes
Marching Home'' to the tune of "When
Johnny (kmes Marching Home." Oth
erwise the ball was a mass of flags
and bunting, characteristic of every
other convention headquarters.
A box with a special police guard
Wa reserved for the Roosevelt family
and friends on the mezzanine floor.
Because of limited seating capaci
ties, delegates from six states were on
the stage back of the press benches.
Chairman Murdock and Secretary
Ravies of the national committee ar
rived just before the hour set, con
ferring with leaders.
The balconies were about half filled,
nd the two upper balconies were al
most bare of spectators. A quartet
singing "Teddy" songs from the bal
cony kept the crowd cheering and wav
ing hats while the fall of the opening
gavel was awaited.
The Michigan defecation, .bearing a
huge banner, inscribed "Roosevelt car
ded Michigan bv 60,000 in 1912 and
can carry it by 100,000 in 1916," and
American flags was the first to form
outside the auditorium. They started

Her head was crushed in the same
manner as the other victims.
COMMITTEE BUSY
Oil RESOLUTIONS
Work of Body Apparently to Be One of
Elimination Instead of Construc
tionAll Have Planks.
Chicago, June 7. With the members
of the committee on resolutions all se
lected by their delegations it is be
coming evident that the work of the
committee as a whole will be one of
elimination rather than of construc
tion. Almost every man on the com
mittee lias planks of his own making.
The general purpose of the leading
members of the committee is to have
the party declarations such as will
meet the demands of Colonel Roose
velt and his followers, and therefore
they have made close study of the col
onel's recent utterances on prepared
ness. Senator Smoot, who although he is
not a member of the resolutions com
mittee is in close touch with what is
being done towards framing the plat
form said:
"We shall declare for a navy that
will be a real protection both in size
and efficiency and up to the latest re
quirements, and for such other mili
tary measures as will meet the de
mands of all emergencies."
The Roosevelt idea on preparedness
will, it is thought prevail. The com
mittee also will go far toward meeting
Mr. Roosevelt's views on the question
of national distinctiveness and there
will be a strong declaration for Amer
icanism at all times, at home and
abroad. There will be no condemna
tion of theso-called hyphenated Amer
ican in exact terms, "but." as a mem
ber of the committee said, "it will be
possible to read that language into the
document."
In addition to the platform work by
delegates on the pround it became
known that Dr. Nicholas Murray But
ler, of New York, and a member of the
New York delegation has been giving
much attention to the party declara
tion and is expected to arrive tomor
row with the complete draft of a plat
form. THE WEATHER

Chicago. June 7. Attempts to block

the National Association Opposed to
Woman Suffrage, which has appointed
a committee to protest against the in
troduction of the issue before the con
vention, according to Mrs. Arthur

Mrs. Dodge, who is president of the
anti-suffrage forces with two members
of the association, will appear before

in the party platform.

gist activity today centered in the
parade in which 20.000 women agreed
to march to the Coliseum, rain or
shine, to present to the republican con
vention resolutions adopted by the Na
tional American Woman Suffrage as
sociation asking that a plank be put
in the republican platform favoring
woman suffrage. The parade was ar
ranged by the National Woman Suff
rage association and the Congression
al Union for Woman Suffrage.
The program for the National Wo
man Suffrage association today called
for a continuance of the assembly at
the Princess theater and later a suff
rage luncheon. The Congressional
Union for Woman Suffrage continued
its convention at the Blackstone
theater with a meeting of committees.
A suffrage luncheon followed at which
Helen Keller, Inez Mulholland Boisse

Eastman were the speakers.
Adopt Anthony Amendment.
The congressional union at its
meetings yesterday completed the or
ganization of the woman's party with
the adoption of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment as the only plank in its
platform and appointed a committee
to demand its incorporation into the
republican platform. Resolutions
were adopted which will be sent to
political leaders in Washington, urg
ing the enfranchisement of women.
One clause of the suffrage resolutions
expressed the intention of the wo
man's party to hold responsible "any
party which refuses to do justice to
women by placing them on a plane of
equality with men in the constitution
of the United States." The assembly
of the National Woman Suffrage as
sociation went on record as opposed to
a campaign for an amendment, to the
federal constitution providing for wo
man suffrage and adopted a resolu
tion to be presented to the resolutions
committee of the republican conven
tion asking for a plank favoring wo
man suffrage.

Republican Convention Gossip
BY J. 31. COLLIGAS.
(Special to The Argus.)
Chicago, June 7. What most im
presses the neutral observer here is
the absence-of enthusiasm, either over
the assurance that is said to prevail
among republicans of the nation that
they are to put a member of their
party in the White house next fall, or
in favor of any one of the numerous
presidential aspirants.
Manifestly somebody has punctured
the Roosevelt boom, and the said
somebody is a well known gentleman
with whiskers at present occupying a
place on the supreme bench of the
United States, a man who may land
the nomination by the sign language
for as far as known at this writing he
has not told anybody that he would
accept the honor if it were conferred
upon him by the convention.
Frank Hitchcock, former postmas
ter general, admits that he has simply
! been taking a long shot on Hughes;
that he has not any authorized word
from him. Of course Hitchcock is
promoting Hughes on the theory that
no man would refuse a nomination
for the presidency at the hands of
either of the great parties. Hitch
cock is a keen politician, and you may
figure for yourself what an important
personage he would become in the
event of Hughes riding into the pres
idency. Four Tears Ago and ow.
Speaking of enthusiasm four years
ago a stranger in Chicago during the
republican and moose conventions had
his hand on his pistol pocket every
time he turned a corner in the loop.
His first impression was that the city
had been captured by plainsmen and
Indians. Most everybody except the
delegates in the republican conven
tion was whooping it up for the hero
of Oyster Bay. Today as one passes
through the lobbies of the hotels
where the delegates are mingling one
rarely hears a conversation that is
attuned above a whisper. It seems as
if each delegate was afraid that
someone other than the person to
whom he is talking was going to get
an earful of information for an enemy
camp.
Four years ago everybody spoke as
though he wanted the whole world to
know just where he stood. He was
either for Taft or Roosevelt. This
week, aside from those who are label
ed, bound and gagged, those who ex
pect to he" on record when the de
ciding ballot is counted, are so con
ducting themselves that they will be
able to claim that their man won, no
matter who is nominated. Occasion
ally a band hoves in view and rips off
some patriotic air, but the delegates
refuse to fall in line and throw their
hats into the air.
"There hasn't been enough excite
ment here since 1 came to keep me
awake nights." declared a Mississip
pian. "Even the red likker lacks the
rise that is contained in the article
we get back home. Of course, ours is
the hip-pocket brand, and possibly
that accounts for the hip. But put
ting aside all jocularity, blamed if I
can understand the obsequiousness of
this convention gathering. If I didn't
know differently I would think it was
a conclave of gentlemen here to pay
final tribute to a party that once was.
If things don't perk up a bit right
soon I'm going to take a few bombs
with my pitcher of chaser to my room
when I retire tonight, and when it
comes 9 o'clock throw the bombs into
the street and arouse the sleepers. Of
course I may be getting old and can't
stir around like I used to in the olden
days, but I'm not moving about with
blinders on, and if there is anything
doing I reckon I would see it or hear
about it. Who are they going to nom
inate? Really, neighbor, 1 hadn't giv
en the matter a thought. Yes, I'm a
delegate, but I just crawled under the
canvas as a compromise, and of course
it makes little difference who my
choice for the nomination might be.
It's up to me to follow the bell cow,
Thai's all."

with George Perkins, who is known
as the doughman of the Roosevelt
campaign. He has a flock of rooms in
the Blackstone hotel. The. press boys
whom I consulted said he was a pleas
ant sort, but was difficult to reach,
and it was a waste of time trying to
run the line of pickets outside his
quarters. But we were not to be so
easily scared. We saw Brother Per
kins once in Maquoketa, Iowa. That
was several years ago. As we were
the only two in the coach he recog
nized us. We discussed finances and
politics, and eWfita him altogether
an unusually well informed man. He
admitted at that time that he had all
the money he needed, and we admired
him for not being hungry for more.
He talked with earnestness, and let us
in on his dreams of helping humanity
generally by devious schemes of his
own origin. As we approached the
Perkins quarters in the Blackstone of
course we were halted by the "chief
outside guard. He waived us aside,
but we refused to acknowledge the
signal and kept moving toward the
brass door knob. It was easily done.
It all depends on the manner in which
such stunts are executed. If you
stand with hat in hand, and nervous
ly view the pictures on the wall, with
a please Mr. aDDeal exuding from
your countenance, you are liable to
be picked up in the duster by the next
maid that appears on the scene. On
the other hand, if you keep under
steam and act towards the guard as if
you knew him all your life and that
his chief was actually awaiting you,
the doors swing open to you as if by
magic.
After the customary handshake,
George you see we know him well
enough to call him by his first name
passed the spearmint, raised the north
window a couple of inches, and in
quired when we were last in Maquo
keta. First he gave orders that he
was not to be disturbed for half an
hour. We protested that we could
learn all we cared to know in a short
er period of time, but we were over
ruled. "Of course you are still carrying the
first spear in the Roosevelt parade?"
suggested we, just like that.
"I wouldn't put it that way exactly,"
said Perk. "I am greatly misunder
stood. I don't expect to profit per
sonally through the selection of Roose
velt. My conviction is that he is the
best man for the country at this time.
We need a man of vigor and decision."
"Down our way we have always un
derstood that you gathered the money
to finance the Roosevelt campaigns,
and that your own contribution headed
the list. It is not to be expected that
one would kick in with a large gob of
his bank roll unless he was to receive
favors at the hand of his candidate
in the event he was successful at the
polls."
"You don't fathom the beauty there
is in living when one feels that he is
helping others. Don't get me wrong.
I mean that through Roosevelt as head
of the nation it would be possible to
be more helpful to humanity."
"Will Roosevelt be nominated V
"Yes, he will be."
"By whom?"
"We hope by both the republican
and moose conventions."
"Our memory tells us that Roose
velt declared some months ago that
he would not accept a nomination
from the republican party unless it
came to him without solicitation on
his part; that there must be a nation
wide demand for him. Hasn't the
colonel somewhat descended from his
dignified position?"
"Yes and no. There is a demand for
him. Doubtless he realizes more than
does the average man the national
need for him there is at this time."
"We have just read letters given
out by Roosevelt from two Germans
who had written him urging him for
the presidency. Do you suppose they
are friends of the colonel's?"
"Assuredly, yes. What would you
suppose them to be?"
"We thought they were trying to

hang the nomination on him so they
would get a chance to vote against
him."
Whereupon Perk passed another
stick of spearmint, slipped us a good
cigar we took it for granted it was
a good one although the band had
either dropped off or had been re
moved with malice aforethought.
Hubbard Looks Like Somebody.
Henry Hubbard, Rock Island county
clerk, resembles some prominent re
publican in Texas. So much so, in

and invited to a number of southern
functions that are to be staged during
convention week.
A distinguished southerner, who ap
parently had been hugging the mahog
any the greater part of the day, cor
nered Mr. Hubbard in the lobby of the
Congress last evening, placed his
arm about his neck and told him how
bad he had wiped the earth with
his opponent in a recent congressional
election in the Lone Star state. Hen
ry tried to protest that he was not the
man his friend thought him to be, but
it was no use, and Henry, being sober,
as his natural condition, saw the hu
mor of the situation, and permitted
the Texan to rave. During the raving
he slipped several cigars into Henry's
pockets, and gave him invitation to at
least a dozen affairs of a social nature,
all of which were thankfully accepted
by Mr. Hubbard.

COUPLEHELD FOR
MURDER OF CHILD
Husband and Wife Arrested in Death
of .Month Old Infaitf Found
Buried I'nder Old Mill.
Quincy, 111., June 7. Bob Eskew
and his wife are being held in the
county jail at Memphis, Ma. awaiting
the action of the grand Jury on a
charge that they murdered their month
old infant. The body of the infant
was found buried beneath the floor of
an old deserted mill building at Gorin,
Mo., yesterday morning.
Eskew and his wife came to Gorin
several weeks ago. Monday they let:
town on foot, and it was noticed that
they did not have their child with
them. A hurried search failed to dis
cover the baby and the couple were
trailed to the bank of the Fabius riv
er, where they were taken into cus
tody. Both said the baby had died and
had been buried at Edina, Mo but
under ft grilling Eskew broke down
and confessed that he had buried the
1 body of the infant beneath the floor o.
the mill building.
