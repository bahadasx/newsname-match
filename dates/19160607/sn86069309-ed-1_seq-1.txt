Monday Bight, about 11 o 'clock.
Heber Hicks, mhi of Jacob 1 1 i e k -.
who is selling; cultivators to the
farmers throughout t h i county,

volver at the mouth of the alley
on Oak street b, 'tween High and
Railroad streets, by a white man
who Mr. Hicks said wore a mak,
and a negro, and relieved of $20
in money and a watch.
Mr. Hicks was on his way to
the Cloverport Hotel, after calling
on a young lady in the southern
part of the city, and as he came
to the alley just above the home
of Wm. Smart, the robbers step
ped out and shoved the gun into
Mr. Hicks' face and demanded his
money. The white man oave the
revolver to the negro and told
him to keep it on Mr. Hicks, and
then he proceeded to ritle the
pockets of the young man who
was too badly frightened to make
an outcry.
Mr. Hicks did not report the
hold-up until the next morning,
and it is very doubtful if the rob
bers will be apprehended, as Mr.
Hicks says he does not know the
number of the watch.

The Southern baptist Convention at
its final session at shcville, X. C ,
adopted resolutions asking for the pas
sage of a national prohibition law; that
the I district of Columbia he made pro
hibition territory, anil requiring better
police protection for public speakers. In
the course of the debate speakers de
nounced the bill pending in Congress to
make the Postmaster General the "su
preme censor of the denominational and
secular press." by giving him authority
to refuse the use of mails to publications
attacking religions.
The prohibition resolution came itp
under the head of the report of the Com
mittee on Prohibition and Social Re

baptists on record as "unalterably op
posed to the liquor traliic, gambling
dens, dens of vice, child labor and the
sweatshop.
