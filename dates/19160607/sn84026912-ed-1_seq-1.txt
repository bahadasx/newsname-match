Admiralty Makes Report.
Skaggerak, near which "body of

the text of tho official report of the

"During an enterprise directed

British fighting fleet, which was con
siderably superior to our forces. Dur

Britain's Losses Over 4,000.
London, June 3.-The latest re
ports from the British fleet, from
neutral vessels which witnessed
parts of the great naval battle in the
North Sea and from survivors, cause
the British public to believe that t!ie
engagement was not so near a de
feat as It first appeared and In no
wiso a disaster. The British losses,
with all the craft engaged account
ed for. were three battle cruisers,
three cruisers and eight destroyers.
The German losses are believed to
have been about Hie same number of
shills, although a much less aggre
gate of tonnage.
British naval experts maintain
that Great Britain continues to hold
the supremacy of the sea by a safe
margin, and that her enormous navy
could better afford the losses it suf
fered than could the smaller Ger
man esta'blishment. The first re
ports of the heavy loss of life, un
happily, have not 'been revised.
Great Britain mourns for more than
4,000 of her best seamen, and the
whole nation is oppressed with sad
ness, which is reflected in tho faces
of all the people of 'London.
There were some 6,000 men on
the ships which sank, and only a few
hundred have been saved. The hor
rors of modern naval warfare far
exceeding those when wooden ships
fought and continued to float even
when they ceased to he fighting
units, were realized to their utmost.
From five of the largest ships which
went under, with a complement of
more than 4,000 men, only seven
junior officers and a few seamen
were rescued.
Rear Admiral Horace L. Hood,
second in command to Vice Admiral
David Beatty, and Capts. Sowerby,
Cay and Prowse were lost with many
others. There were no surrenders,
and the ships which went down car
ried with them virtually their whole
crews. Only the Warrior, which
was towed part way from the sceno
of battle to a British port, was an
exception.
Of some thousand men on the
Oueen Mary only a corporal's guard
is accounted for. Tho same is true
of the Invincible, while there are no
survivors reported from the Indefati
gable, the Defense or the Black
Prince.
(No statement of the German
losses In officers and men hav*. been
given out. London, however, voices
the opinion thal they will be found
to have been "exceedingly heavy.")
Ji?i?t Itritish Officers Lost.
London, June fi.-A total of 333
officers were killed in tho Jutland
battle, according to a list Issued hy
the admiralty to-day. This list shows
that practically all tho officors of
the cruisers Queen Mary, Invincible,
Indefatigable, Defense and Black
Prince, and from tho destroyers Tip
perary, Turbulent, Fortune, Ardent,
Nomad. Nestor and Shark perished.
All tho officers except ono from tho
cruiser Warrior were saved, and nil
the officers from the destroyer Spar
row Hawk. On the other ships 23
officors were killed arid 22 wounded.
Virtue may bo Its own reward, but

of the Walhalla Presbyterian church.
Rev. Mr. Fogartlo was one of those
unassuming gentlemen whose daily
life gave forth abundant ?vidence of
a close walk with God. He was
greatly loved by all who knew him
in tilts section, and the news of his

from the Christian Observer:
Hov. Jumes IO. Fognrtie.
"Rev. .lames 13. Fogartlo, I). I).,
postor of the Presbyterian church at
Hawesvllle, Ky., died In that city on

torate about one year ago from New
Orleans, La., but owing to ill health
he bad recently resigned lils charge
and was preparing to go away for
treatment.
"ille had a long and honorable ca
reer in the Southern Presbyterian
Church as pastor and educator. He
was born in Charleston, S. C.. and re
ceived the degree of H. A. from Da
vidson College, (North Carolina,) in
1874. In 1877 he was graduated
from Columbia Theological Seminary.
(South Carolina,) and was licensed

wife or Rev. W. H. Hill, pasto'- of

haven, ?.Miss. In lils death the Pres
byterian church loses one of her In
fluential and scholarly ministers."
Account ot' tho Accident.
The following account of tho dis
tressing accident which caused the
death of Rev. J. ID. Fognrlie is fro*?!
the Hancock Clarion, published lu
Hawesvllle, Ky., where Dr. Fogartie
was killed:
"Rev. J. EJ, Fogartie, pastor of the
local Presbyterian church, died in
ibis city Thursday morning a*. 4
..'clock as the result of being struck
and run over by an automobile
driven by -Miss Gertrude Stephens
Wednesday afternoon. In the car at
the time with Miss Stephens were T.
D. Hale, agent for the 'Ford Automo
bile Company, who was teaching Miss
Stephens how to manage tho car,
and her father, Judge M. Stephens.
"The minister was crossing the
street on lils way lo tho poBt office
when the auto carno around the
corner. As to the exact actions of
Hov. Fogartie when he noticed tho
approach of the automobile, accounts
differ according to several onlookers.
Some say that he apparently became
excited and stepped backward two or
three steps and made an effort as if
to catch hold of the front of the car,
and, in so doing, placed himself di
rectly in front of the car, which
struck him with considerable force
and im ried him to thc ground in snell
a position that two of Hie wheels
passed over his body. Others are of
thc opinion that the minister stood
perfectly still, only raising' his hands
ns If warning the occupants of his
prOSOnc?, when the machino struck
him. All agree that heroic efforts
wore made by both 'Miss Stephens and
.Mr. Hale to stop tho car when tho
minister's presence was noticed. The
llrst to rench tho sc.eno were Lester
Wilson and L. C. Kelly, and to them
he spoke tho only words uttered. Ho
said, "Raise me up," three times, and
"I am dying" three timos. Dr. Cros
by was called, and all that was possi
ble was done for him, but with no
avail. After a short time he was
carried to tho homo of 'Misses Nannie
and Kate Jackson, whore he died.

and was most highly esteemed. Ho
