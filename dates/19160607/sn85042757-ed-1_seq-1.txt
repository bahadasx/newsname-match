TO HELP THE FARMER.
Information Sought That Will Bring
More Buyers Here This Fall.
Last week the Chronicle mailed out
175 blanks requesting the farmers and
live stock men over the county to re
port the amount of money they re
ceived the past year from the sale of
cattle, sheep and hogs; the number ot
each now on hand ; the number of each
they expect to have for sale this fall
ana winter, with each blank we en
closed a stamped and addressed envel
ope so that the least possible trouble
would be experienced in making the
report.
We trust every person who receives
one will respond promptly with the in
formation sought. We may have
missed some persons who should have
had a blank, if so we regret it and
shall be glad for them to report to us
any way.
When this information is in hand,
which we think will be within a week
or ten days, we shall prepare an article
touching the live stock industry and the
farming results in the past with the
outlook for the future, giving only such
things as we are sure are indisputable
facts.
We believe such an article will be of
great benefit to the county as a whole
in that it will give to homeseekers
just such information as they will most
desire and such as is many times diffi
cult to secure.
It will be of great benefit to the
farmers directly in that it will make
available for live stock dealers infor
mation as to the number ot live stock
that will be for sale in this section this
fall and winter.
One of the worst handicaps the farm
ers of this county have had in the past
to that buyers have not been aware of
the number of live stock that this
county puts on the market each year
and for that reason not so many buyers
have been coming here as would have
been bad the real situation been more
generally known.
It has been amply demonstrated that
when there are numerous buyers in the
field prices have been better than when
confined to a few who felt that they
could get the goods at practically tneir
own price.
For the reasons stated we believe we
are performing a very helpful service
to the farmers in particular and to the
pbulic in general in getting together
this information. We hope every per
son who receives one of the blanks
mentioned will feel sufficiently inter
ested m the general welfare of the
county as well as their own personal
interests to fill out carefully the blank
and return it promptly.
It is a well understood fact that there
are splendid opportunities in this sec
tion for homeseekers, that we need
mote people to develop this section as
it should be, that there is ample room
here tor thousands more people and
that by increasing our population the
burden of taxation on account of the
roads now building will be lightened
for one and all. There is not a single
logical reason why we would not do all
possible as individuals and as a people
to induce people to settle here, for it
will not only prove helpful to us all but
will also prove s safe and wise move
tor the newcomer.

Hands His Resignation to Judge Bur
nett and It Is Accepted.
Friday Sheriff G. W. Toney handed
his resignation to County Judge G. P.
Burnett and informed Judge Burnett
at the same time that he wished to re
turn to the republican party of the
county the nomination they gave him
through a primary election March 25.
Judge Burnett accepted the resigna
tion of Sheriff Toney and Monday a
mass meeting was called and the party
authorized the county executive com
mittee to select a candidate. The date
set for the meeting of the county com
mittee is Saturday, June 17. Else
where in this issue will be found the
call as issued by Chairman A. L. Gar
rison. The mass meeting was called to order
by Chairman A. L. Garrison and the
object of the meeting stated. Judge
G. P. Burnett made a brief talk ex
plaining the situation and closed by
offering a resolution that the conven
tion authorize the eounty committee to
select a candidate to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Sheriff
Toney. The motion was seconded by
J ere Morrow ana was passed unani
mously. The convention then adjourn
ed Sheriff Toney was serving his second
term in office. Some months ago he
tendered his resignation to Judge Bur
nett and it was accepted. When the
county court met to select his successor
be came before the court and admitted
that he bad yielded to the influence of
intoxicants on some occasions, but that
he had determined to do so no more and
asked that he be re-elected. After a
few ballots he was selected by the
court. He made the campaign before
the people for the republican nomina
tion and was successful by a majority
of 133 votes. Owing to several things
that have transpired recently Sheriff
Toney became convinced that the best
thing he could do would be to resign
and retire entirely from the position he
has held twice by choice of the people
and once oy the will of the county
court.
Cumberland county has rarely ever
had a more efficient officer, especially
so far as arresting law violators goes,
than G. W. Toney. But he saw the
situation was beyond his control and
with due consideration for "the rights
of the people who had honored him, he
has quietly stepped down and out. He
has many friends over the county who
will very much regret the unfortunate
conditions that rendered his retirement
advisable.
Mr. Toney will probably return to
Ins farm near lsoline and there make
his futur home.
John Q. Burnett, county coroner, is
acting in the capacity of sheriff and
has chosen J. S. Garrison to have
charge of the jail until a sheriff is
chosen by the county court at its next
regular quarterly session, Monday,
July 10.
It now seems probable there will be
several aspirants tor the place of sher
iff before the county committee when
it meets. Those who have been men
tioned are John Q. Wyatt J. D. Wy
att, Francis Myers and H. D. Shaver.
There may be others, however, by the
time the committee meets.
English and German Fleets Suffer, But
Advantage With Germans.
Last Wednesday the greatest naval
battle in history was fought in the
North Sea between the English and
German fleets. The English admit the
loss of fourteen war vessels and tha
Germans seem to have lost about tha
same number, but their tonnage mi
much less.
The English admit the loss of three
battle cruisers, three cruisers and eight,
torpedo boats. The loss in men is esti
mated at over 4,000 for the English and)
probably over 2,000 for the Germans.'
The Germans admit the loss of one
battleship, two cruisers and seven tor
pedo boats. Both sides claim mere
losses for the other than either will
admit. The English claim the loss of
men to the Germans was nearly equal
to theirs, but Germany does not admit
that. In view ef what is actually
known it seems the British loss waa
probably one-half more than was suf
fered by the Germans.
In the matter of tonnage ot the ves
sels lost the losses seem to be about aa
follows : England, over 100,000 tons)
Germany, over 35,000 tons. It has
been estimated that 150 vessels were
I engaged in the fight first and last, but
that seems to be out of all reason.
The tight lasted far into the night
after beginning about 4 o'clock in the
atternoon. The German fleet put back
to port in Kiel canal. In spite of
the heavy loss sustained by England,
she a till iemains unstress of the North
sea, because of the great original pre
ponderance 11 ber t:u or. The Germans
are naturally much elated over the re
sult. England was much cast down
when the first reports came, but after
full detail.9 were received the loss did
not prove so crushing as at first
thought. The English claim that their
whole fleet was not engaged while the
Germans claim it was. Conditions
seem to indicate that the English
statement is correct.
So much drastic criticism came from
the English press and the people that
the admiralty felt it necessary to do
something to "save its face' with
the people and prevent a crisis, hence
the admiralty is now claiming that the
fight was a real victory tor England
both in vessels and men lust. The
English public will pretend to accept
the last version and it will avert any
serious rupture among the high naval
officials but the world sees too clearly
the real situation to accept the last
claims of tbe English admiralty.
SUFFERING ARMENIANS
ROAD WORK.
The highway commission have pur
chased a five ton traction engine and a
road grader of tne same pattern as the
one owned by the county. 1 hey tried

the result that they decided to par
chase one to do the general road woik
that is to be done with the $200,000 in
road money recently received from the
sale of bonds.
Work is progessing west of town ana
C. K. Keyes has been actively at work
tor some days surveying the east end
of the Memphis to Bristol highway and
work will commence on it as soon aa
matters can be arranged.
Hundreds Dying for Lack of Funds to
Feed the Starving.
Armenian exiles eating grass and
dying of starvation by hundreds, is the
startling message received May 15th
from Constantinople by the American
Committee for Armenian and Syrian
Relief, 70 Fifth Avenue, New York.
The cablegram says that suffering
among the exiles, deported from their
homes by Turkish soldiers, has been
greatly increased on account of their
refusal to accept the Mohammedan re
ligion, but that in spite of all suffering
they are not losing their Christian
taitb.
The Committee now has reliable fa
cilities for reaching the needy, and its
commissions in several centers of Tur
key, Persia and Syria are under the
direction of American Consuls and
Missionaries.
THE AWFUL FACTS.
Armenian population of Turkey,
Persia and Syria before the European
war, 2,000,000.
Massacred or died of wound, disease
or exhaustion 750,000.
Survivors about l,200,b0.
Destitute and starving Armenians,
Nestorians and native Christians (non
combatants) in Turkey, Persia and Sy
ria, 1,000,000.
Amount ot money needed to rehabil
itate the destitute and starving, $5,
000,000. Amount of meney raised thus far,
