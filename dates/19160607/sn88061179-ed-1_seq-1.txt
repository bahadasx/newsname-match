Notes.
The Woman's Civic League

ing in the sample room ?f the
Monte Vista Hotel Oil Friday
afternoon at four o'clock, Mrs.
J. L. McCormick presiding;
The Cemetery Committee,
through the Chairman, Mrs. M.
It. McCorkle, reported a most
encouraging response to the
lottere recently mailed to lot
owners. Mr. D. ('. Anderson,
formerly of the 'lap. now of
Philadelphia, sent a check for
live ($5.00) dollars to the Gon
oral Improvement Kittel accom?
panied by a kindly letter of
commendation and encourage
mailt with further instructions
relative lo his lot in the Ceme?
tery. Miss Sue Dent from Sol
in's Grove, I'enn., wrote im?
mediately relative to an esti?
mate for the proper care of the
lot where her sister, Miss
Kathryn, sleeps. Miss Dent
will be glat) to know that the
Camp Kiretiirls have been tak?
ing excellent care of this grave
knowing that no near relatives
lived in tin' I lap. Mrs. Caboll
had already secured the desired
estimates for Miss Dent.
Mrs. Harry Price sent the
Committee another live dollars
for the General Knud from
Charlotte, X. O, and Mrs. ( )|is
Mouaer, of this place donated
two ($2,00) dollars, one for the
General Fund and one for ex?
penses of clean-up day in the
t lemetory.
Out-of-town owners of lots
have made some improvements
quito recently in the Cemetery.
Among these are Mr. Carrier
and S?pt. \V. A. .lohnson, of
Stonegii.The former has enclos.
ed his lot with a cement coping
The fountain circle has been
planted with dahlias and other
?towers donated by members of
the League.
As Mrs. Caboll has moved
away from the Gap, greatly to
t|ie regret of the members of
the Civic League, it was neces?
sary to appoint another Corres?
ponding Secretary, and as Mrs.
Marvin Kelly was absent from
tin- meeting, this job was given
her.
Oil account of illness in the
family of the Treasurer, Mrs.
Knight, there w as no report of
Lougtic finances made at this
meeting, further than the state?
ment that then; was a balance
ol eleven dollars in the Batik
This balance looked apprecia?
bly larger after Mrs Knight had
deposited the checks mentioned
above.
The League was pleasantly
surprised to have the new man
ager of the Monte Vista; after
inquiries relative to the purpose
of the meeting send a hoy lo ar?
range chairs and tables tor the
convenience of the League,
staling that in the future lie
would see that the sample room
was in readiness beforehand,
The ladies were strongly inclin?
ed to giv.ii Mi. Henkel a rising
vole of thanks for his kindly
consideration for their comfort
and convenience.
His Honor, the Mayor, was
not in attendance at this meet
ing of the League las he should
have been i, but one or two mat?
ters of importance relating to
the health of the town were re?
ferred to htm for investigation.
Letters to the League on var?
ious subjects were discussed
and passed on. It was with ex?
treme regret that it was found
that it would be impossible for
the League to send a delegate
to the convention of the Getier
alKederation of Women's Clubs.
The next nieuting of the
League will be at the residence
of the president on account of
the fact that the sample room
is rather uncomfortably hot in
July, though Mr. Henkel
courteously proffered the use
of the parlors of llpohotel for
this meeting.

PARENT-TEACHERS" AS
SOCIA [TON NOTES.
The organization of the local
Association is planning to have
at letiBt one speaker hor<> from
Kichmond at the .Inno meeting.
For the ueholtt of those who
have beeil unable to attend ei?
ther of the two meetings al?
ready held in the public school
lllilitorilim', we again state the
purpose oi the Association
which is to bring the people to?
gether in an organization that
the\ maj meet regularly, pre?
ferably in the Hcboolbuildiiig.
for the discussion of ways and
means lo improve the "school
and community. Those meet?
ings should he of real social
value, lor one of ihe most seri?
ous draw hacks to village und
country life is a lack of whole
sohlt.ciul life mid community
spirit.
For lack of funds, there is
much that the school hoard
cannot do, such as beautifying
the school grounds, putting in
apparatus for (he playground,
and placing a library, pictures
and many conveniences in tbo
gclioolbllildillg, but these things
can bo done by the local com?
munity
I In- use of tin1 Bchoolhuilding
is granted to the Association
fbi i.'tings, social gatherings
and entertainments. Therefore,
ovoiy school should be equip?
ped f oi those community meet?
ings, and the people should as?
semble there regularly to dis?
cuss the problems that confront
them, then work as a unit for
tin- necessary improvements,
i Sanitary, health, educational,
recreational, social and moral
improvements should be dis?
cussed. In other words, every
person in the community, both
young and old,should derive the
greatest benefit possible from
the school, and this can bo done
by the whole community work?
ing together for and through
the school.
What is the condition of our
public sellout building'' Hoes
it attract the children? Is it so
equipped as to insure good
health conditions?
How about the social ami
niual life of our community?
It is all that could be desired
Do the young people enjoy liv
ing in the '-lap, or are they
eager to move to a live pluco
Are the children and parents
reading good literature?
These are some of the things
a good Pardnt-Te?chera' As?
sociation in Big Stone Uap cau
help accomplish.
