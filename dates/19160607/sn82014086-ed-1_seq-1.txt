Kitchener's Successor The Passing of a Strong Figure.
(London, June 8. The news that!
Earl Kitchener, secretary of state for
war, and his staff, who were proceed
ing to Russia aboard the cruiser
Hampshire were lost off the Orknery,
Islands last night - was the most stun
ning Wow Great Britain has received
since the war began.
This is the second shock the conn
try has sustained within a week. The
other was when the newspapers ap
peared Friday evening with the first
intelligence of the naval battle in the
North Sea in the form of a list of the
ships lost, with virtually no Intimation
that there was any compensation in
the- way of enemey losses. The bul
letin telling of the death of Kitchener
paye the country an even greater
shock.
Idealized By British Public
Kitchener was the one outstanding
personality whom the people talked of
and believed in as a great man, not
withstanding newspaper attacks.
which rt. a former period of the war
threatened to undermine his popu
larity and tho public confidence In
him. "
News Quickly Spread.
A teleram from Admiral Sir John
JMlieoe, commander of the fleet, giving
th bare facts, was received at the
admiralty about 11 o'clock in the
morning.
The first official announcement was
issued at about 1.30 In the afternoon.
Such news, however, cannot be kept
entirely secret even for an hour. Be
fore noon rumors were spreading, and
the telephones in the newspaper of
flees were tousy with inquiries 'nnxtous
' to know -whether this one -of -the.
many reports circulating In theses days
' of tension had any foundation. They
were told there was noting to it.
." Riotous Scenes About Exchange.
When the official announcement fi
nally was issued the fact spread about
London some time before the news
papers could get Into the Btreets.
There was a riot about the stock. ex
change which required police reserves
Jo deal with it. The police told every
one to move on; that there, was no
' truth In the reports.
At the same time another mass of
people was assembling about the gov
ernment offices in Whitehall. - All the
windows of the war office had the cur
tains lowered. That confirmed the
rumor beyond doubt. Other crowds
eathered around the newspaper offi
ces; when the boys came out with an
armful of extras the people Tell oij
them and fought for the papers. In
the course of the afternoon the flags
on all buildings were half masted.

MEXICAN BANDITS HEADING
FOR THE BOUNDARY.
Point Aimed at is Weakly Guarded by
tha United States.
San Antonio, Tex., June 8. General
Ftmston announced today that he had
what appeared to be positive informa
tion that Luis de la Rosa was march
ing from a point south of Laredo in the
direction of the border, with the evi
dent Intention of raiding the country
somewhere west of Rio Grande City.
There are not now in that district
enough American troops to prevent de
la Roeu and his men from crossing.
General William A. Mann, command
ing the American forces in that dis
trict, with headquarters at Laredo, re
ported to General Funston that he is
taking such measures as possible to
strengthen the patrol towards the east
and to guard Laredo.
East of Laredo, in Zapata county,
across the south boundary .of which De
Ls Rosa Is expected to move, there is
only one troop of American 'cavalry.
Said to Bo Close.
Just at what point on the border the
Mexicans Intend to strike was not
learned, and it was not announced just
how far away they were today, but
they. were said to be comparatively
near.
If Da La Rosa and his men reach, the
Rio . Grande before American troops
can&ead them off. enough force will be
sent Against them to drive them back
into Mexico and, it was intimated, to
run them down on Mexican soil.
; ' Prfb sn Head of Mexioan Leader.
Z La Rosa was one of the leaders
of the group that directed the raids
west of iBrowneviUe a year. ago. Since
then he. has been a fugitive in his own
country with a price- of 91,000 on bis
head, offered . by the state of Texas.
If the ' raiders strike American, terri
tory in Za-pata .county little injury to
the residents is anticipated, because,
witbj the exception- of one or. two fami
lies. u are-Mexicans.

came with an absence of emotion
surprising to outsiders. But no one
could have walked the London streets
today without perceiving that some
thing which the common people took
as a calamity had befallen them.
Other Valued Officials Lost.
The foreign office was saddened by
tne loss of one of its siost valued
members, Hugh James 'O'Berine, while
fair Frederick Donaldson, and Briea-
dier General Ellershaw, of the minis
try of munitions, were known to be
men whom the nation could little af
ford to lose.
Kitcherner's Successor Problematical,
The fact that the cruiser Hampshire
with between 200 and 300 men had
sunk was accepted as an unfortunate
detail in these days when a thousand
go under ajmost as an incident of
warfare, and the Canadian's battle
gets a scanty column in the newspa
pers. The king came from "Windsor
and sent for Premier Asquith when he
heard the news. The war council held
a long session. Naturally speculation
regarding Kitchener's successor began
immediately.
Amon? those discussed were David
Lloyd George, Lord Derby and . the
Chief of Imperial Staff, Sir William
Robertson. But whether a military
man or a civilian will take the war of
fice has not yet been decided.
Will Go Down in British History.
Earl Kitchener met death at a mo
ment which will insure his position in
British history. He was almost the
only member of . the government who
from the beginning confidently asserts
f.A that this wbuldbe a long wajr his
lowest estimate was three years and
he Insisted that the . government
should make its plans accordingly.
The organization of the enormous new
British army is well under way. The
general staff, under General Sir "Will
iam Robertson's direction, according
to belief has well In hand the work
ing out of details which Kitchener's
brain was largely instrumental in
planing and launching. There is no
evidence to show whether the Hamp
shire was submarined or struck a
mine. Many ships have been passing
between Russia and Great Britain over
the same route since the port of Arch
angel was opened.
The official announcement was a
greater surprise that it would other
wise have been because no one knew
that Earl Kitchener has left England.
A memorial service will be held in St.
Paul's.
The nation was depressed and
grieved at the news of General Town
shen's surrender at Kuit El Amara,
but not. before has it been saddened as
today.
BRITISH EMBASSY
AT WASHINGTON
Deeply Depressed at Kitchener's End
His Work Practically Finished.
Washington, June 6. Profound sor
row over the loss of Earl Kitchener
prevailed at the British embassy here
today, but members of the embassy
staff found solace in the belief that
his death now would not toe the na
tional disaster It might have been
earlier in the war, before he perform
ed his stupendous task of creating the
greatese fighting machine Great Brit
ain ever has known. It was said his
work practically was finished so far as
raising and equipping the British army
wa s concerned and that his duties of
late had been rather of a diplomatic
than a military nature. It is assumed
tho visit to Russia upon which he had
embarked probably had as an objective
closer co-operation in military policies
in Asia Minor and Persia-

those who perished with Lord Kitch
ener, was In the United States two

lishments to ten hours a day, present
ed, to the Supreme Court one of the
most delicate questions it had been
called upon to consider in twenty
years. - ' -
A series of decisions - in previous
yeans had upheld the validity of legis
lation limiting the hours of lafoor on
public works, whether conducted by
the government or by private enter
prises. In 18S8, the Supreme Court
U,U I ; Jv I
one enacted by the state of Utah
limiting the hours of labor of men in
underground mines, in smelters and in
ore reduction wonts. The decision
was based largely on the recognized
danger to health arising from condi
tions under which those occupations
lay. Another step was taken in 1908,
when the Supreme Court upheld the
validity of the Oregon statute limiting
the hours of labor of women in me
chanical estafblitfcments, factories and
laundries to ten nors in any one day.
On the other hand, the Supreme
Court had annulled in 1905 the New
York statute limiting the hours of
labor of men in bakeries to ten hours a
dal. The decision was based on a
comon understanding that there was
no reasonable relation between a ten
hour day for "bakers and the public
welfare.

Chicago. June 6. The republican and
the progressive - national conventions
both assemble tomorrow without any
indication that tbe leaders have found
th9 common ground on which they
hoped to establish unity. Three days
of almost constant conferences have
failed to bring the republicans and the
progressives to an agreement on a man

Enthusiasm Lacking.
Not since the party was born "has
there been such a lack of leadership
among the republicans, and the oldest
convention observers declare they
never have seen such a general lack of
enthusiasm. There never has been a
convention for which so little lad been
arranged beforehand. They plunge into
their work tomorrow with practically
everything undone which hitherto has
been done for them in the inner coun
cils of the leaders.

3C0 for Hughes on First Ballot.
The supporters of Hughes have been
counting noses. Speaking for them,
Frank H. Hitfchcock estimated the jus
tice would receive about 3-00 votes on
the first ballot. He said reports had
been encouraging and predicted that
the Hughes vote would grow rapidly
alter the preliminary ballot.
States Line Up for Hughes.
Florida decided during the day to
cast her solid vote for Hughes and to
stay with him to the end. A poll of
Kansas is reported to give nine votes
for Hughes. From New Jersey, Hughes'
managers expect to get at least seven
teen votes. Rhode Island's vote of ten
is reported solid for Hughes, and sub
stantial gains were claimed in Oon
necticut and other states.
If a ballot could be taken tonight,
the consensus of the several political
hnanagers indicated that it wouid be
atout ae follows: Hughes 261, Weeks
160, Roosevelt 98, Cummins 81, Fair
banks 80, Burton 70, Sherman 58, Knox

by each expectation of a declaration
contrary to that interest.
Many believe that euch an exuies

The varying counsels' thus ir.ai-j
cated have been urged upon the for-i

is surmised that they have had much
influence in causing him to remain
silent. During the evening the wor-t
was circulated that Colonel. Roosevelt:
had manifested a disposition' to follow
the advice of the progresfrives-at-any-cost
and the general opinion was that
nothing would be heard from Oyster
Bay favorable to any republican as

that in point of numbers It Is a third

of the delegates to the progressiva

In some cases they are openly dls-l

In order to bring large delegation

into nair votes, making double thet
number of delegates to be controlled!
