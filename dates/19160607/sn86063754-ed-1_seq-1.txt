Mr, Funderburk is a ''creamery
man" and he sells about one
hundred dollars worth of butter

Belle was one of the oldest
horses in the county and was
about 35 years old. They do
say that Belle lay down and
died when Mr. Lee got his handsome
new Buick touring car.

try and can be exterminated by
greasing each fowl with 33 per
cent mercurial ointment which
can be bought at a drug store
The grease is placed on the flesh
below the vent, covering a space
not larger than a 25 cent piece
with a small amount of the oint
ment. This ointment poisons
the lice end it is necessary to
apply it only once a month.
Sitting hens can be greased
before the commencement of
the hatch and when the chicks
are dry. If the latter peep and
stand with their eyes closed, ex

you will probably find one or
more large bead lice. Anoint
the bead and the part under the

House Voles $6,000,000 To En- 1
large Navy Yards
Washington, June 1.?Advocates
of greater preparedness i
than is provided by the naval
bill as reported by the committee <
won some victories today in the 1
House. They succeeded in obtaining
appropriations not to ex- 1
ceed $6,000,000 for enlarging the <
Navy Yards at Norfolk, New <
Orleans, Charleston, Boston, <
Portsmouth, N. H., Philadelphia 1
and Puget Sound. Capital ships 1
would be constructed at the Norfolk,
Puget Sound, Philadelphia j
and Boston yards. An amend j
ment designed to lower the en- (
listment period in the Navy i
from four to three years and to
permit men to enter the reserve i
after one year's service also was s
adopted.
An unsuccessful fight was led <
by Representative Gardner of <
Massachusetts against the section
of the naval bill, embracing l
the Hensley resolution authoriz i
ing participation by the United j
States in the establishment of an
international court for the en- <
forcemeot of peace. The sec- i
tion was retained without a roll i
call in the House, sitting as a
committee of the whole ]
Pacificists, so called "little na- <
vy" men and manv advocates of
general preparedness rallied to i
the support of the section, i
Speaker Clark took the floor i
and aroused enthusiasm by de- i
claring the section was the best <
feature of the bill. j
The Hensley section would j
appropriate $200,000 and provide
for the appointment of nine men
by the President, at the close of
the European war, to enter into
negotiations with other countries i
for establishment of an interna ^
tional court to enforce peace.
It was placed in the bill as a <
compromise when it appeared 1
that the opponents of a greater 1
Navy would not support the s
committee measure.
Representative Garnoer de I
clared the plan could not be '
carried out and that if the Uni !

New Discovery to Take The
Place of Gasolene
A dispatch from New York
>ays:
Louis Rnricht has sold the se:ret
formula of his penny and a
tialf a gallon for $2,000,000!
Enricht's neighbors in the lit
lie village of Farmingdale, down
:>n Long Island, thought En rich t
ireaming when he claimed he
:ould operate an automobile
with a mysterious green liquid
tie invented.
But the Maxim Munition Com
pany figured the formula so
?ood it has agreed to pay $1,000,300
in cash and $1,000,000 in
stock to the inventor.
The process of manufacture,
morvr/ltnnr 4 ? - -
uin^ IU ijiuitui, i1) very
simple.
Four ounces of a strange
:hemical mixture, green in color,
is stirred into five gallons of
water. The solution goes into
the auto's tank and the auto
runs just as it would if fed with
gasoline.
Henry Ford visited the inventor,
who is 70, and he came
away convinced that Enricht's
discovery was genuine, it is said.
The cost of manufacturing the
liquid is about one and one halfzents
a gallon.
Here is as much of an explanation
of his invention as Enricht
is willing to make: The
addition of his "green mystery"
to the water in the "gas" tank
of an auto releases the hydrogen
gas in the water, The hydrogen
passes into the carburetor,
where it comes into contact
with the air, taken into the engine
through the air intake pipe.
The explosive energy to drive
the engine is the result of this
combustion. ?
Just after he announced his
discovery, Enricht stopped making
his fluid because, he said,
tie didn't dare to go to drug
stores to buy ingredients.
4lI can't go anywhere without
being followed by detectives
working for the oil companies,"
said Enricht.
Maxim company officials say
they will produce a substitute
that will be used by every auto
owner and knock the bottom
out of the high price of gasoline.

did not know that. With
the assistance of the best authorties
he had prepared an elabo

criticism.

possible as the speaker piled rul

Fall Crop of Irieh Potatoes
Clemson College, S. C.?The
Irish potato is one of the most im
portant truck crops of the South,
yet. it is a crop that is grown to
a limited extent by the people of
our State. The farmers do not
produce enough for their own
use during the winter months.
During die last few years, we
have tested a large number of
varieties at this Station, the idea
being to find a variety especially
adapted for planting in mid-summer,
or as a second crop. The
trouble with most varieties is
thnt tllPV f.lil tr> V.
...... . vj iuii iu o^'iuui w null
planted in the summer, and
therefore, the stand of plants is
very poor, and the yield neceSt
sarily unsatisfactory. We have
found that the Lookout Moun
tain potato will produce better
when planted in mid-summer
than when planted in the spring.
The tubers will keep from November
until the following August
in perfect condition. If this
variety proves to be well adapted
to the Eastern part of our State,
it seems to me that it will practically
revolutionize potato growing
in this State. The potato
can be grown as cheaply in this
State as any where else, and the
fact that two crops may be
grown on the same land in nine
months, make this vegetable of
especial importance. A spring
crop may be grown and shipped
to the Eastern markets. Anotli
er crop may be planted on this
same land, and the tubers harvested
in November for market
1 .? -
during me winter months. The
strong points of this variety are
that 95 per cent of the tubers
planted in July and August will
produce stong plants, and it
k?eps better than any variety I
have ever grown. Unfortunately,
it is, not as good for baking
and for cream potatoes as some
other varieties, but we hope by
selecting to overcome this defect.
I strongly recommend that
a series of experiments with the
Irish potato be begun at the
Coast Station.
Do Good, But Don't Talk About
It
Atlanta Georgian.
Don't be a braggart.
Don't be vainglorious.
If you do some good act and
you cannot forget about your
goodness, your motive was not
right, no matter what you told
yourself.
Real charity is not done to
gratify one's vanity.
Neither does the recipient of
your kindness like to feel that
you tell , people how much you
have done to help So and So
along.
It takes all the pleasure away
from one who is granted a favor
to have some one come up and
say: 4'I have just heard of what
A did for vou, and I think it was
lovely of him to do it. Of
course, he could as well as not,
but many another would not
have been so generous."
It leaves a sting when you
find out that your kind friend is
reporting his goodness to you,
and what shall we say of the
one who is constantly reminding
the recipient of the favors bestowed?
Don't do good so some one
will have to pat you on the back.
Almost any person would
rather do willunn a favor than
find out that his benefactor is
making capital out ol his generosity.

Unless You Pull Fodder For The <
Fun of It, Here's a Better
Plan
The demonstration force has 1
set itself to the task of stopping
fodder pulling in this state by
getting so much other forage I
grown that it will not be neces
sary. State Agent Hudson makes
the following comparison of the
two methods of saving forage:
"One method is to pull one blade
of fodder by hand at a time.
This is not only slow and therefore
expensive, but it comes
usually in the hottest part of the
year. The other way is to grow
clover, cowpeas and other legu
uiinous crops ana narvest them
by horsepower, cutting a swath
three or four feet wide, with the
blade running almost at lightning
speed. Certainly any busi
ness farmer will admit, even
without testing it, that the latter
plan is more economical. It is
a question, in other words, of (
the farmer increasing his work (
power, and therefore his earning
capacity."
Mcst farmers who pull fodder ,
every year do so not because they ,
are compelled to, but because ,
they are in the habit of doing so.
It is now time to get ready to
obviate the necessity of having
to pull fodder this year. ,
The thing to do is to grow |
some of the splendid crops? ,
cowpeas, soy beans, velvet beans, ,
millet, etc.?that are so well ,
adapted to that purpose. A
farmer who does this a few times
will not have to resort to the
antiquated method of stripping

two expensive, but very often a
few rains will destroy the fodder
after it has been pulled, and ,
therefore the farmer loses his
forage, his labor and has also j
reduced his corn yields For the ,
heaviest yield of corn the leaves
of the plant should be left on the ,
stalk until the corn is well ma- ,
tured.?North Carolina Experi- ,

What to Do for Chigger, or Red
Bug, Bites
It may bfe of interest to know
that it is not the adult red bug .
that does the biting, but the little :
orange-red larvae that are hatch ;
ed from the eggs usually in June, ,
July and August. The adult red ,
bugs are harmless and care noth
ing for human society. The lar- ,
vae. or vounn rt?d hntr* will
w r-? |
leave their native haunts, leaves,
grass and damp logs, for just |
one fateful burrow into the hu j
man skin. I
Moderately strong ammonia (
water has been recommended as ,
probably the best cure for the ,
bite. A solution of soda water ,
is also good, and the old house- ,
hold remedy, salted butter, is au
excellent remedy if used before
the bugs have burrowed very '
deep. Another splendid idea is j
to take a strong salt water or \
soap suds bath as soon as possible
after becoming infested.
Removing the chigger with the
point of a needle is not n hn<t
plan, but the point of bite should
be touched with a toothpick i
dipped in tincture of iodine and ]
alcohol, equal parts ?North Car- j

Greatest Naval Battle of the
War
The great naval battle of the
present war was fought last
Wednesday, and the reports of
the losses bv the British and by
the Germans are very conflicting.
The battle was off the
Jutland coast between the German
and British navies.
London, June 4.?The British
admiralty tonight issued a statement
saving there was the strongest
grounds for the belief that
the British navy in the battle
with the Germans off Jutland
last week had accounted for a
total of 18 German men-of war
and that there was nothing to
add to or subtract from the original
announcement of the British
lossses.
The statement gave the German
losses as two battleships,
two dreadnought battlecruisers,
four light cruisers, nine torpedo
boat destoyers and a submarine.
The pessimism which prevailed
as a result of the admiralty's
original statement of losses,
which now is considered to
have been needlessly candid and
conservative in underestimating
the extent of the German lossess
as compared with those of Great
Britian has been greatly lessened
by the latest statement.
A dispatch from Copenhagen
says rumors are current in Hamburg
that two additional warships
than those announced in
the German communication?
the battleship NVestfalen and the
oattiecruiser Lutzow?\\ ore sunk
in the battle. A wireless dispatch
received here Saturday
from Berlin said the German admiralty
admitted the loss of the
Westfalen.
The - admiralty statement tonight
declares that the German
losses in the fight were not only
relatively but absolutely greater
than those of the British. Maintaining
its practice of caution,
the admiralty still refrains from
giving the names of the lost
German ships
The Indefatigable the Invincible
and the Queen Mary were the
battle cruisers sent to the bottom
by the Germans. The cruisers
Defence, Black Prince and Warrior
also were lost. The War
nv^i 111 si was reported Uisaoieu,
but subsequently it was announced
that she had to be
abandoned bv her crew.
The battle seems to have lasted
through the afternoon and the
following night. The German
fleets' losses are stated to have
been serious but no very definite
information of these losses is afforded.
One batllecruiser is declared
to have been destroyed
and another severely damaged,
while the belief is expressed that
a large number of German destroyers
were disposed of.
Following quickly upon the
Admiralty announcement, came
the German official version of
the fight which, in general, confirms
the British account, bat
claimed that the battleship Warspite
also was sunk and other
British battleships damaged.
The German losses, according
to the German version of the
battle, were the small cruiser
Wiesbaden, sunk by gunfire and
the warship I'ommern by a torpedo,
while thcc.ui.er Frauenlob
and a number of tornedo
boats are missing.
The news was flashed out in
special editions of the evening
newspapers and caused greater
consternation in the West Knd
if London than has been witnessed
on any previous occasion
since the declaration of war.

innou icemen! concerning the
serious nature of the British losses
and the apparently small losses
of the Germans in comparison,
