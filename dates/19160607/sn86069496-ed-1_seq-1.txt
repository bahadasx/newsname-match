Condition of Railroad Proposition.
We yet lack several thousand dollars
in getting our old subscriptions to our
railroad proposition resubscribed.
These old subscriptions must be re
newed before we can tell where we
are. We have assumed they would all
resubscribe. The amount we have is
yet considerably short of our necessi
ties. There are yet many who will be
benefited that have not helped us a
cent. They should help bear this
heavy burden since in- doing so they
will also help themselves.
Our Bankers may be, and doubtless
will be compelled to cull deep into our
subscription lists and to meet this cull
newsubscriptionsmustbe made.
The amount we have cannot be
known until the money is paid either
in cash or by notes our bankers will
take. This is bound to be the final
test. Every man knows we must have
sufficient subscriptions to put suffi
cient money to the credit of our com
mittee to answer all requirements of
X the-contract to be made.

There was an atmosphere of glad
ness about the M.E. 'church Sunday
that came with thejaiowledge thafc
the beloved pastor, the" Eev. J. S.
Chandler, had been restored to his
own again. The good man has almost
regained his health, and was able to
fill his pulpit at the morning service
It was Memorial Sunday and the pas
tor spoke on the theme of mercy, ap
plying his "words to a prayer for peace
and an answer to the cries of want
from the suffering Armenians, who
have been impoverished by the war.
On next Sunday a collection is to be
taken at this church for the benefit of
the suffering Armenians. Each mem
ber of the congregation will deny him
self or herself some luxury and donate
what it would have cost to those war
beggared people across the water.
