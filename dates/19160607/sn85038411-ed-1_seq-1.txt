Coliseum. Chicago, June 7. —Practical reunion of the two
elements of the Republican party is confidently predicted as a
result of negotiations and exchanges which have been under
way since last night and which are expected to take form dur
ing the day. These exchanges are proceeding along lines
which contemplate a return to the Republican fold of the Pro
gressives under the direct leadership of Colonel Roosevelt and
upon a platform which will meet the views of the most ad
vanced thinkers of the party. There is a strong undercurrent
favorable to party peace and this sentiment was strongly voiced
in the speech of the temporary chairman. It need surprise no
body to see the most spectacular political reunion in the history
of the country with Roosevelt himself leading the Progressive
forces into the joint session which is now being discussed.
E. J. S.
Coliseum. June 7.—The Republican National Convention after
a two-and-a-half-hour meeting to-day adjourned until 11 o'clock to
morrow. after hearing the keynote speech of Senator Harding, of
Ohio, and doing the usual preliminary organization work.
Emphasizing that it was not a time for recrimination but of
reconsecration. Senator Harding urged the delegates to forget the
disastrous differences of four years ago and plunge into the coming
campaign with a declaration of principles which would bring suc
cess at the polls.
The convention received the temporary chairman's speech with
punctuations of applause and cheers and his sallies against the Dem
ocratic administration with loud laughter and hand clapping.
Senator Harding spoke about an hour and closed with a
peroration of Americanism and Republicanism.

Chicago. June 7. As the Re
publican and Progressive Conventions
assembled to-day there was no out
ward evidence of any marked change
in the situation. Overnight con
ferences among the leaders failed to
develop any definite plan on which
they could agree on a candidate who
would receive the undivided support
of both factions but talk of peace was
in the air. The proposal to have both
conventions appoint conference com
mittees was being discussed on both
sices and some of the Republican
leaders persisted in their predictions
that ultimately there would be
harmonious action in some way.
The convention leaders themselves
were so engrossed in petty details of
getting under way, taking care of
delegations from their own States, and
guests, that they had little time for
further serious discussion of candi
dntes and realized that the considera
tion of that question had actually
mo\ed to the conventions themselves.
Some of the Republican leaders
felt to-day that their convention
vnicht not proceed to nominations be
fore Friday and even later if pros
pects of harmony develop at the last
moment. The favorite sons were con
sidering the question of holding their

Huglics Gains strength
If there was any change at all in i
the line-up over night it showed an.
increase in the strength of Hughes. J
For the most part, the figures of the
managers of favorite son booms were
not changed.
On this the convention day of two j
parties, bringing together more thanj
t»wo thousand delegates, there was;
not a sign of a demonstration or a
band parading until an hour before;
the time of assembly. This was
partially explained by the notable lack j
of demonstration which has been one
of the unique features of this conven- i
tion period and partly by the fact that
a cold rain continued to sweep the
city. As the hour of assembling ap
pi cached the bands and the delegates
started moving toward the convention
halls. They were a sorry soaked and
bedraggled looking lot as they

From His Speech
By dissociated Press
Chicago. 111., June 7.—Delegates and
guests of the Progressive national con
vention arrived slowly for the opening
of the convention at 12 o'clock, one
hour after the Republicans' assembled
at the Coliseum. The band began to
play at 11 o'clock, but there were few
to be entertained, and the musicians
gave up without completing their first
number.
When delegates began to take their
places they did so quietly. Only a few
of the states attempted anything like
massed entry.
Apparently nothing had occurred to
stimulate enthusiasm and nothing was
expected before Raymond Robins de
livered his keynote address as tem
porary chairman.
At 12.27 the convention was called
to order by Victor Murdock, chairman
of the national committee. He rapped
with his gavel for several minutes be
fore quiet was obtained.
Bishop William Fraser McDowell,
of Chicago, offered the invocation, a
voice shouting "Everybody up." The
prayer expressed hope that the efforts
of the convention would redound to
the benefit of the republic; that the
national convention "may serve hu
manity to lead the world to liberty,
truth and righteousness."
The bishop asked for help for "the
war-stricken world" and for Divine
help to "bind up thf nations that are
broken and wounded."
Following *he prajer "America" was!
sung, the entire convention standing
and all joining in the national anthem.
