the large number of vacancies
in the galleries of the conven
tion hall.
Scores of notables entered
the convention hall unrecogniz
ed and unapplauded.

which brought frequent ap
plause. A sustained 'demon
stration greeted his' declaration
for a navy fearing none in the
world.
Reference to Wilson's re

fight" brought jeers and ap
plause. The address consumed
an hour and twenty minutes.

and jeers, a. & rough Senator Har
ding's referenct iriff, Ire drew ap
plause. Laughter ' jeers greeted
his reference to tlu 'langing posi
tion of the democratic party mani
fested from Baltimore to Vera Cruz."
As the speaker went through the
long list of indictments of lack of
achievement of the democratic party,
the convention voiced approval by first
applauding one sally and then cheering
another. The speech came to a close
with a peroration of Americanism,
which was frequently interrupted by
cheers. His demand for the protec
tion of American rights under every
sky was fondly applauded. Senator
Harding touched on the Mexican situ
ation extensively to the apparent ap
proval of the convention, as he scored
the democratic administration's poli
cy step by step.
There was a wave of laughter as he
declared the administration has "first
colored Villa as a patriot and then
chased him as a bandit." "History
will write Mexico as a title to the
greatest fiasco in the history of our
foreign relations," he said and then
referred to the situation as one of
watchful waiting and wobbling war
fare. This brought roars of laughter.
Roosevelt Opposed to Hughes
Chicago, 111., June 7. The New
York republicans supporting Hughes
said today that they were informed
from reliable sources two days ago
that under no circumstances would

E
LAST: NIGHT
HOTEL PROPOSITION DISCUSSED
AND RAILROAD FARE REFUND
QUESTION WAS THOROUGHLY
GONE INTO.
That everything else should give
way to the hotel project, and that
every effort should be used to get
one for Ardmore, was the substance
of strong resolutions passed by the
Business Men's associaUon at its
regular meeting last night. The as
sociation pledged Itself to do any
thing in its power in the Interest of
a hotel, and will consider any propo-J
sit ion made and assist any organiza
tion or set of men who will make it
their single purpose.
The refund of railroad fares was
reported ready to launch Just as soon
as the printed matter was off the
press. Secretary Gilbert was In
structed to take up with the county
attorney the legality of a "premium
club" scheme which is being worked
in the city.
I'nder the head of new business, a
resolution that "the matter of a hotel
for Ardmore be not allowed to bo
dropped" brought out an expression
from more than a dozen merchants.
That the Chamber of Commerce be
assured that it would get the united
support of the business men was the
substance of the discussion, and It
was freely expressed that "all keep
everlastingly at it until the end sought
was attained."
"Everyone should make it his per
sonal business to agitate this mat
ter,' said A. D. Maddox, "and all ef
forts should be concentrated on it
to the exclusion of everything else.
No one knows better than we real
estate men what we are losing by
inadequate hotel facilities. It is the
most important issue before the peo
ple of Ardmore, and I would be in fa
vor of dropping everything else until
we get what we want
Following the discussion, the fol
lowing resolution was passed:
"fie it resolved, that the Business
Mens association will lend its entire
strength to aiding the Chamber of
Commerce, any Individual, or set of
individuals, who will make any rea
sonable offer which will mean a hotel
for Ardmore.
"Be it further resolved, that we
pledge active and united effort to
such a movement and Invite any bona
fide offer which entails either the
taking of stock or giving a reason
able bonus."
