Discussion at Chicago as Yet
Fruitless of Results
PERKINS CONTINUES HOPEFUL
Progressive Chairman Favors Resolu
tion Calling for Conference
With Republican Leaders.
Chicago, June 7. At 11.45 today
National Chairman 1 lilies introduced
Warner G. Harding, tlie temporary
chairman of the republican convention,
who delivered his address. The pro
gram tor this afternoon comprises the
calling ui" the roll and the completing
nl' the temporary organization. From
all indications t'.u delegate, when the
session adjourns, will return to the
hotel lobbies to resume, the so far
fruitless discussion that has been in
progress during the past two days.
here has been no crystalizing of
sentiment upon a candidate. It is con
ceded that Hughes has a good load
over any one ot the other candidates.
but all efforts toward a coalition of
the republicans and progressives have
apparently failed. Senator Borah of
Idaho eliminated himself as a candi
date today.
The radical progressives under the
leadership of Henry Allen of Kansas
still show a determination to nominate
Roosevelt on the first ballot. George
Perkins is still hopeful that a com-
promise will he cnected and a resolu
tion will be introduced during the af
ternoon advocating a conference.
Chicago, June 7. The republican
and the progressive national conven
tions both assemble today w ithout any
indication that the leaders have found
the common ground on which they
hoped to establish unity. Three days
of almost constant conferences have
failed to bring the republicans and the
progressives to an agreement on a man
for the presidential nomination. A
half dozen names, any one of which is
acceptable to the republicans, have
been rejected by the progressives, who
have proposed practically no name but
Col. Roosevelt's. Not since the party
was born has there been such n lack
of cohesive leadership among the re
publicans, and the oldest convention
observers declare they never have
seen nich a general lock of enthusiasm.
Hughes leaders, remaining con
fident in their predictions that the
justice will be nominated on an early
ballot, were lining up their forces last
uight. Progressive leaders, unwilling
to say if they could, whether the
colonel would support the justice, con
tinned to carry on their fight for .Mr.
Roosevelt as their first choice.
The republican managers, pressed
by the progressives to hurry their
nominations and disclose their candi
date if they hope to bid for Col.
Roosevelt's support and prevent a pro
gressive ticket from taking the field.
have been given notice by Senator
Smoot that they can expect no nomina
tion in the republican convention be
fore Friday. Senator Penrose, address
ing the Pennsylvania republican state
delegation, yesterday, declared that
nominations for President will not be
made before late on Saturday.
Tbo supporters of Hughes have
been counting noses. Speaking for
them Frank II. Hitchcock estimated
the justice would receive about 3"0
votes on the first ballot. Ho r.ald
reports had been most encouraging
and predicted that the Hughes vote
would prow rapidly after the prelimi
nary ballot.
If a ballot could have been taken
last night the consensus of the sev
eral political managers indicated that
it would have been about as follows:
Hughes, 2(11; Weeks, 1(10; Roosevelt
!S; Cummins, 81; Fairbanks, 80;
Hurton, 70; Sherman, 58; Knox, 51;
Root. 42; ha Follette, 28; scattering
54; total, !S3. This excludes two
delegates from the District of Co
lumbia, who were unseated by the na
tlonal committee, but will take. their
case before the credentials commit
tee.
The allies generally conceded that
Mr. Hughes was In the lead, but the
fait that he occupies this advan
tageous position was not allowed to
stand in the way of their efforts to
hold their forces in hand. Their plan
Is to prevent an early stampede to
the Hughes column In tho hopo that
delay may bring into the situntion
some new element which would wonlt
en him and promote the prospects
some one of the other candidates. All
of the candidates were receiving fi
orable assurances front their friends
and in view of the situation thus ere
ated the general opinion is that sev
eral ballots will precede the iiomlna
lion. This opinion is based upon the
supposition that no surprises will be
sprung and that all hands will he con
tent to prolong the uncertainty.

HELPED OPEN THE WEST
Dexter M. Camp, Aged 84, Visits Ben
nington After 65-Year Absence.
Dexter M. Camp, a veteran of the
Civil War, a pioneer of the old west,
and a man who has seen the price of
his wheat rise from 25c a bushel to
the present price of 11.21, has returned
to visit Ills native Vermont after an
absence of 65 years. He will spend the
summer in this vicinity looking up
friends of his boyhood. At the pres
ent time lie is stopping at the home of
lils cousin, Henry G. Camp.
To go through the four years of the
Rebellion; pass through the trying
time3 in tlie slego of Vicksburg, be
several times wounded but finally re
ceive an honorable mustering out; go
west into Kansas and Oklahoma when
the only neighbors were Indians, bison
and antelope; be twice married, raise
lti children and lose six of them; and
finally at 84 years of age be in such
physical trim that one can make a
journey of over 5i)00 miles alone, con
stitutes a life of rich experience few
men are privileged to live.
All this happened to Mr. Camp and
he is still hale and hearty with a. .mem
ory unimpaired and the walk of n man
forty years younger.
Mr. Camp was born in this vicinity
in 1832, the son of James Camp and
Betsy Jepson Camp of Pownal. He
passed his boyhood In the rugged
weather of southern Vermont and was
first married here, but shortly after
the California gold fever struck the
country, bade goodbye to the Green
Mountains and started for the golden
west. He got as far as Illinois and had
been living there but a short time
when the Civil war began and he
promptly enlisted in the 47th Illinois
regiment and served the whole four
years.
lie went through the Mississippi and
Vicksburg campaign under Grant and
was captain of a company during that
memorable siege. When asked to
name the battles in which he partici
pated his memory was in such good
shape that he called them off faster
and in more perfect order than they
could be taken down even In newspap
er shorthand. He saw fighting at
Farmington, Miss., the siege of Cor
inth, luka, Miss., Corinth again on Oct.
3rd and 4th, 18G2; Vlcktburg, May
22nd. Raymond, Jackson. Rig Black
and Champion Hill. Cupola, Miss., and
the Red River Campaign, lie. was
several times wounded, although not
seriouy. He carries for the head of
his une a canister ball which caused
one of his wounds in that fighting.
Some time after being mustered out
he
went to learned, Kansas, when the
country had few white men, and took
up government land. At that time
herds of bison roamed the plains
Fresh meat was to be had only for the
trouble of a little shooting. The In
dians in that part of the country did
not trouble him and as the country be
gan to open after the war, he went In
to the business of wheat raising an 1
ranching.
Previous to leaving Pownal he had
married Miss Lucy Sweet who joined
him in his adventurous life In tlie west.
Put she died in 187t! and he married a
second time, losing his second wife
about three years ago. Sixteen chll
dren came from these two unions, six
of whom he has outlived. He has 57
grandchildren and 21 great-grandchil
dren.
From learned, Kansas, he moved to
Oklahoma where he spent about 12
years in farming and stock-raising and
whence he started hist summer to sec
the United States. On May 27th of
last year he left for the California ex
position. After seeing the sights nt
San Francisco he went to San Dlegn
and saw the exposition there, went
down into Mexico and visited relative's.
thence up to l.os Angeles where he
was a guest cf a brother he had not
seen for 40 years. After spending
three weeks in that locality he took
boat for Seattle and went 3uo miles
bark into the state to visit u daughter
He came back to Seattle, went to Port
land and 150 miles south visited an
other daughter. He traveled the Co
lumbia River, then went down to Salt
Lake City where he spent another
week. He came back to Kansas by
way of Denver and Colorado springs
and started east to attend the na
tional grand army encampment in
Washington, I). C.
After visiting in Washington until
the encampment was over he left for
Florida, later coming up tho coast,
stopping off at. all Important sight
seeing points untli he reached Phibi
delphla and New York. From New
York he returned to his native Ver
mont ami began looking up old friend:
and. relative J.
Mr, Camp owns considerable proper
ty in Kansas and Oklahoma at the pre
sent tune ana wheat wntcti he once
sold for 25c a bushel when he first
went west, now brings $1.21. He has
had many amusing experiences look
ing up companion of his boyhood and
experts to stay in Vermont until Sep
tember. He still enjoys excellent health
and believes at the age of 81 thai then
pre ctlU many years of rich living
ahead of him.

RUSSIA RESUMES
OFFENSIVE WITH
BiB VICTORY
Bear's Sudden Strike is Disastrous
for Austria
0VER25.000 TEUTONS CAPTURED
Operations Embraco Battle Front
From Pripet i Marshes to
Rumanian Frontier.
Petrograd. June ' G. The sudden
blow struck by the Russians along the
entire Galician front of 275 miles from
the Pripet to Rumania, which so far
has resulted in the capture of 480 of
ficers, over 25,000 mfm, 27 cannon, and
half a hundred machine guns, is, in the
unanimous opinion of the military
critics here, a brilliant beginning of
the long awaited Russian offensive.
The condition of the roads is now per
fect, and with a plentiful supply of am
munition the Russian advance is ex
pected to develop swiftly.
The movement derives significance
from the fact that it is not an. isolated
attack against any one portion of tho
Austrian lines, but a carefully co-ordi
nated movement embracing the whole
front. The movement is under the lead
ership of General I'.russiloff, who con
ducted the brilliant campaign in the
Carpathians in 1014. and who is gen
erally conceded to be one of the best
strategists of the Russian staff.
The forces opposing the Russian ad
vance are estimated at rorty Austrian
infantry divisions and from ten to fif
teen Austrian cavalry divisions, assist
ed bv at the most two divisions of Ger
mans. This brings the total Teutonic
forces operating on this front up to
600,0(m men.
No details of the Russian attacks are
yet at hand, but it was preceded as
usual by a vigorous artillery bombard
ment, after which the Russians moved
forward alom the whole line, captur
ing first-line Austrian positions. The
initiative belongs entirely to the Rus
sians and the AustHans, evidently tak
en by surprise, fell back without being
able to start a counter offensive.
ANNUAL COUNTY PICNIC
To Be Held at Arlington on Friday,
June 3C.
The third annual county picnic will
be held this year at Nlchol's grove Ar
lington, Friday, June 3u. If it should
rain that day, the picnic will be held
on the following day-, Saturday, July
1st. The program will be simi
lar to last year's; there will be a pag
eant, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor",
given in the grove on the west side of
the road, which will consist ot careful
ly enacted Bible stories; an athletic
and field-day program, including base
and volley ball contests; a roll-call by
schools, and many other interesting
features which will be mentioned later
There will be better traffic regula
Hons; the highway will be policed, re
moving the element of danger from
passing automobiles and making the
crossing of the road lrom one grove to
the other perfectly safe. There will
be the regular morning train from the
north nt that date, and then there will
be tho special one from Bennington
same as last year, and the usual low
rates of fare. While the program is
similar in many respects, yet every
year the picnic committee profits by
former experiences, so that each an
nual picnic promises to be better than
its predecessor. This picnic will be
everybody's picnic and it Is hoped that
the parents will accompany their chil
dren as far as possible. The time of
departure of trains and the price of
tickets will be given to . the public
later.
PRINCIPAL KIBBEY RESIGNS
Has Been at Head of North Benning
ton High School Since 1909.
The many friends of Prof. II. 11.
Kihbey of the North Pennington high
school were much surprised and griev
ed to learn of his resignation.
Mr. Kibbey came to North Benning

nual feature, was also by him intro
duced. A number of school plays have
been given each year, the enjoyment of
which not only has been appreciated
by the people of North Pennington
but bv those in the nearby towns in
which they were given.
The whole community will be af
fected by the departure of Mr. and
Mrs. Mbliey as they huvo taken a
great Interest in all public affairs. It

GOOD ROAD TO MONUMENT
Movement to Repair Main Street and
Secure Underpass Beneath Track.
Residents of both villages are very
much interested in a movement which
is on foot to get the local railroad, the
stte and the town of Pennington to
contribute their legal share toward the
expense ot constructing; an underpass
beneath the track between this vil
lage and Old Bennington.
The crossing for years has been a
danger spot and an obnoxious place in
descending the hill smoothly for auto
ists. The plan is to grade the street
past the old St. Francis church in such
a way it passes beneath the track,
giving a much smoother descent. En
gineers who have looked at the grade
declare that it will be no steeper than
at present and probably much more
gradual.
The matter Is up to the state public
service commission. The commission
authorize certain underpasses each
year. Just' what the cost would be for
the local job has not yet been made
public, but in case it materializes 05
percent of the expense must be paid
by the railroad, 25 percent by the
state and 10 percent by the town or
village in which the improvement is
located.
Residents of Old Pennington held a
meeting la:t evening in connection
with the trustees to push the innova
tion forward. In connection it will
mean that Main street out of the vil
lage and up the hill will receive a new
surfacing of macadam and provide a
perfect roadway from Bennington to
the monument, an improvement which
is declared sadly needed. It will take
one or two years even yet to get the
actual work under way, even though
the three parties to the transaction got
together on the expense this summer.

tled out of court. The real business
of the court began this morning. Cases
represented by Collins M. Graves and
1). A. Guiltinan as counsel were car

PABLO LOPEZ IS SHOT
Firing Squad at Chihuahua Puts Villa's
Aid to Death.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, June S.
Pablo Lopez, Villa's Chief Lieutenant
in the raid upon Columbus, N. M., to
day paid the penalty for his crimes,
facing a firing squad of Constitutional
1st soldiers at Santa Rosa, Chihuahua's
place of execution.
Lopez, who had gained the sobriquet
of "The Butcher" by the almost count
less atrocities he had committed in
the name of Punclio Villa, was cap
lured in' a cave a short distance from
Santa Ysabel, Chihuahua, on April
He had been deserted by all of his fed
lowers except three, ana these were
captured at the same time and taken
to Chihuahua City for execution. Dur
ing the Columbus raid, when eighteen
mericans were killed. Iopez was shot
through both legs, and was reported to
have been killed. However, he again
appeared at the fight when Villa took
Guerrero, when he was said to be
wounded and carried In a wagon drawn
by his men.
When Lopez was captured he was
starving and in a critical condition
from loss of blood and lack of medical
attention. Ills complicity in the Co
mmons raid was proved by papers
found on some of the raiders killed at
Columbus, among which was a memo
random book that had belonged to
Tom isvnns, one of the Americans
killed. The papers showed that "The
Butc her had been sent by Ilia to
commit, the raid.
Ills execution was delayed in tho
hope that he would give out valuable
information that might lend to tile
capture of his chief, but he would only
admit that Villa was "over there" In
the distant mountains. In addition lo
tho Columbus raid. Lopez was second
In conianind under Villa at tho Santa
Ysabel raid, when sixteen Americans
were killed.

by Strikers.
Poultney, June 5. A powder house
containing 300 kegs of powder valued
at $2.50U was blown up late last night
at the Fred Sheldon quarry here, pre
sumably by strikers, by the. use of dy
namite. The explosion followed an announce

Sheldon's have been out two weeks.
Four slate quarries are now idle here.
Sheldon's, Rising fc Nelson, and the

cern. The strikers' demands are for
an increase of two cents an hour and
that their 15 minute lunch hour at

HUGHES STILL INSCRUTABLE
His Secretary Denies School Speech
Has Political Significance.
Washington, June 6. The efforts
of President-makers and others at Chi
cago to force political capital out of
the address which Justice Charles !
Hughes delivered at the Cathedral
School for girls last night failed to ruf
fie the temper or unseal the lips of
that Jurist today. That part of the
speech in which Mr. Hughes declared
that the American flag means "Amer
ica first" and "undivided allegiance
may bo interpreted In Chicago as a
keynote," but if it was intended as
such the silent Justice does not admit
Lawrence 11. Green, the Justice's pri
vate secretary, asserted today that the
address, which was delivered with the
presentation of a flag to the graduating
class, was meant purely and simply as
a talk to the ghia of the institution
where a daughter of the jurist Is a
pupil, and had no significance. Mr.
Green explained that Justice Huches
had promised to make the address
months ago, that it was not intended
for public consumption, und was not
given out for publication. Washington
today refused to find particular polit
ical significance in tlie speech.
