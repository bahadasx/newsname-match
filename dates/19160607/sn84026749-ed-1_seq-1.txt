sanctioned the methods employed
by the "vice squad" was given to
day in the trial, of Policeman Ma
son L. Howes, charged with unlaw
fully and forcibly entering the
home of Mrs. Rose Kennctt, at 326
328 Delaware avenue northeast.
A disagreement that for a time
was indulged in by attorneys for
Howes, the presiding judge, and
Assistant Corporation Counsel
Robert L. Williams, counsel for J.
E. Elliott, accused with Howes, en
livened today's session.
The effort made by counsel for
Howes to have Elliott testify on
material points precipitated a dis
agreement. OBJECTS TO TESTIMONY.
Attorney Williams objected to his
ollent answering any questions on
the ground that his answors may
tend to incriminate him. This view
was opposed by Attorneys A. A. Blr
noy and Michael Mangan, and Judge
Mullowny, over the objection of Mr.
Williams, twice advised the witness
to answer.
"1 objected to this witness testify
ing, and now I protest against any
enori maao 10 nnvo ;'", ",
dence." Attorney Williams declared.
This man Is charged with a similar
offense as the defendant, and I Insist
upon him refusing to answer any jn.
aulrles." continued Mr. Williams.
Judgo Mullowny said that he could
not understand the objection made
by Mr. Williams, and advised the wit
ness to answer th; questions. Where
upon. Attorney Williams told the
court he thought he had the right to
at least confer with his client before
the answer was recorded.
The conference was held, and when
Elliott returned to the stand he an
nounced that be believed his answer
might tend to Incriminate him, and
that he declined to respond.
Question Put to Him.
The question put to the witness had
to do with whether he was at Mrs.
Kennett's house on March W or March
15, and If he had any knowledge or the
location of a pocketbook and register,
which Mrs. Kcnnett alleged were miss
ing. The first witness examined this morn

from Major Pullman, after the suspen

as If nothing happened." The witness

SOME NEWS FOR YOU AND
PRESIDENT WILSON
YOU and President Wilson are getting identical reports on
the Chicago convention.
The Washington end of the United Press leased wire, which
is located in the Munsey building, was looped into the White House
executive offices today, thereby giving the President opportunity
of getting "hot off the wire" all the news of the day.
The President will be "on the Washington end of the wire,"
together with The Washington Times, throughout the Democratic,
as well as the Republican, convention, so that readers of The Times
and the President will be getting identically the same reports of
the conventions.
KEYNOTE PLEA
Asks All Believers in Republican
ism to Rally Under Harmony
Banner in Reunited Party.
EXTENDS THE OLIVE BRANCH
CHICAGO, June 7. "Ameri
canism" was the keynote and party
unity the appeal of Senator War
ren G. Harding's speech, formally
opening the Republican National
Convention today. The vast ma
jority of the p'cople, Harding said,
expected the party sponsors "to
write anew the sacred covenant of
Republicanism and reconsecrate
the party to the nation's service."
"We did not do very well in mak
ing for harmony the last time we
met," the temporary chairman said
in opening his address.
"The country has regretted, let
us forget and make amends, to
our country. We did not divide
over fundamental principles, we
did not disagree over a national
policy. We split over methods of
party procedure and preferred per
sonalities. HOSTS ARE ALLIED.
Harding's speech Is as follows:

Prisoners, Says Petrograd.
LONDON, June 7. The interest of
the military critics of Europe Is now
centered on the armies of the Czar,
The Dear's offensive has now heen
Id operation for a week, each day
growing: in length of line attack and
In freauency of Infantry rushes.
According to official announcement
fYom Petrograd the drive has already
resulted In the capture of nearly 30,000
prisoners, with cannon and small
arms.
The Cxar has more than 1,000,000
men, massed from the Trlpet marsh
to Truth In the Bessarablan region.
Critics believe the Austrian defenders
are but half that number.
For several days prior to the Rus
sian offensive the official Austrian
report bristled with announcements
of successes In their drive In the
Aslago-Arslero region.
Vienna Admits Withdrawal.
No reports of successes hero have
been made in past few days, Indicative
that the Austrlans already may have
withdrawn troops to bolster up the
line against the Cxar.
Vienna officially admits that the Aus
trlans were compelled to withdraw
tnelr lines north of Okna to positions
"prepared a little more than thrco
miles to the south."
This means that the first effective Im
press of the new Russian drive has
been made at the tactically and politic
ally most vital point of the front under
attack, just north of the Uukowloa
IJessarabla border.
If the Russian success Is followed up,
Csernowltz, the Bukowlpa capital. Is
onoe more seriously threatened, and an
Invasion of the Oallclan crownland
would go far toward achieving the chief
political aim of the new offensive, the
entry of Roumanla on tho allies' side.

For Americanism Shortly Before Noon.
CHICAGO, June 7. When the Republican and Bull Moose con
vention opened today they faced squarely the extremely practical
question whether Woodrow Wilson is to be handed the Presidency
for another four years on a silver platter.
Any talk about peace and reunion and harmony for the last week
has failed to bring peace, about. The two parties are yet far from united.
Whether they can be united remains still the real problem.
This morning, following twenty-four hours of anxiety and appre
hension over the probability of a third ticket, headed by Roosevelt,
there was. sign of an adjustment in the fact that the leaders have evolved
a plari for the selection by each convention of a conference committee
which will seek to arrange for harmonious action.
The plan for Republicans to name a conference committee is still
tentative.

"I am very well satisfied with tho

A few minutes later Governor John
