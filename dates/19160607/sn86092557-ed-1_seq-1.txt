E PRECINCTS NOT YET HEARD F
Fleming Got Flattering Vote For Congress?Sutherland
Makes Good Showing for U. S. Senator
Returns in Detail.
XJut few surprises were shown in
the result-of the Primary in Marion
county as far as is known at press
time of the West Virginian this af
ternoon.
The total vote polled has not yet
been determined as a number of pre
fe' clncta have not yet returned their cer
tificates to the county and circuit
clerks. It is generally conceded how
ever, that tho total Republican vote
will exceed the total Democratic vote
by several hundred.
In the Gubernatorial contest on the
Republican ticket, which has attract
ed considerable interest, it is estimat
j ed from the returns that have so far
been received that Robinson's ma
| Jority of Lilly will roach about 1,200
! ;: ';T. W. Fleming will receive approx
imately 1,400 majority in this coun
j ty over Heme in the contest for the
| congressional candidacy. Hito in the
I race for tho U. S. Senator nomination
j leads the county with Sutherland a
good second while White and Rosen
I bloom were both low. The strong vote
Ljfor Sutherland in this county was the
chief surprise of the election. Bow
j ers, Eliason and Hutchinson arc con
| ceded to have received the nomination
|for House of Delegates in this county
! and in tho contest for state superin
| tendent of schools, Murray leads Sham
key in this county by a safe majority
got 600 to 700. In the comity offices
Veach for sheriff leads his competi
tors by 200 to 200.
j On tho Democratic ticket Cornwall
! for'^Governor was especially strong
and his piajorlty is likely to reach
x 1,200 to 1,500. Glover for sheriff on
this ticket is concedod a majority of
500 or GOO over his competitor Smith.
Musgrove and Conaway are the nom
inees in Fairmont district for Justice
of Peace, this being one of t^e hot
i contests of this ticket.
The work of counting the ballots
\* began last night immediate after clos
ing of the polls but it was past elev
' en o'clock before even tho small dls
, tricts where tho vote was lightest
| were heard from. The majority of
tho certificates and ballot boxes wcub
; turned into tho county clerk this morn
I vlng but becnuso of the confusion and
I delay caused by the various candi
| dates and their friends in trying to
i ascertain as soon as possible the vote
for-themselves the work of tabulating
the vote from the sheets progressed
I very slowly
Present indications are that the of
ficial result of the election will not
be known before Friday when the
county court meet to canvass the re
j turns. The estimates as given above
are by no means final and are sim
I ply compiled from the verbal and oth
er reports from the election commis
sioners at the various precincts and
collected for tho information of the
candidates in the contested offices.
The county clerk's office has been
besieged since early last night with
candidates and party workers who are
thirsting for inforn^tion but by their
presence have done more to hinder
the work of ascertaining tho result
than any other one cause.
Following is tho detailed vote by
precincts for the candidates in which
the most interost in the contest has
been manifested:

At 2:30 o'clock this afternoon but
two counties in the entire state were
able to furnish complete returns on
the gubernatorial contest in the Re
publican party and reports from some
of the counties indicate that it will
be days before the result on the min
or offices will be known. The two
counties that were in today are Ohio
which gave Robinso nl,4S0, and Ritch
ie which gave Robinson 290.
There does not seem to be a rea
sonable doubt that Judge Robinson is
the Republican nominee. The esti
mates of the majority he polled over
his opponent Attorney eGneral Lilly,
range all.the way from 12,000 to 5,000

Senator Harding Makes No
table Speech at Opening
of Convention.
(By Associated Press)
CHICAGO, June 7?With a plea for
party reunion lor reconsecration rath
than recrimination, United States Sen
ator Warren G. Harding, of Ohio, in his
address as temporary chairman open
ed the Republican National convention
hore today. Asserting that the coun
try was "wearied afresh by a disap
pointing and distressing Democratic
administration," and was calling" for
Republican relief the speaker, before
undertaking to discuss political issues,
appealed to the delegates to forget the
differences which divided the party in,
1912.
Referring to the administration's for
eign policy in the European war Sen
ator Harding declared that it had
spoken with more rhetoric than reso?
lution. Mexican negotiations he de
scribed as the greatest fiasco in Amer
ican foreign relations. Ho paid tribute
to Americanism of foreign birth with
brief reference to the few zealots who
would impugn the nation's neutrality
and urged a fratornity of American Re
public under the Monroe Doctrine. Ad
vocating adequate national defense he
charged the Democratic party with
having interrupted the Republican
naval construction and he criticized
the array re-organlzation bill. He also
attacked the administration shipping
bill, the effort made to extend inde
pendence to the Phillipines, and made
a plea, for a return to the protective
tariff.
"We did not do very well In mak
ing for harmony the -last time we met"
the chairman said In his appeal for
harmony. "The country has regretted
let us forget?and make amends/to our
country. We did not divide ovw fun
damental principles, we did not disa
gree over our national policy. We split
over methods of party procedure and
prefered personalities. Let us forget
the differences, and find new inspira
tion and new compensation in a united
endeavor to restore the country.
"Republican principles are in a vast
majority in this country?when the
banners of marmony are unfolded. We
have witnessed the comeback of the
party In various states. We have seen
?the re-enlistment of those who believe
in Republican doctrines, and victory
has followed and rejoicing has a ttend
ed. No apology has been asked, no
foreswearing retired. This is not
the time for reolmlnatlon, It Is the day
of recttastruction.
"Rededicating here and now the Re
publican' party to the progress and
glory of the republic, let ub bury.party
prefixes with the administration which
our differences put In p ower. I do not
.believe there 1b a really reactionary
Republican bearing credentials to tliis
convention. If there to. he will depart
after our deliberations, proudly a Re
publican, with heart aglow with the
party spirit of 1916. And'the welcome
delegate who emphasises his progres
slrelim, 1b expected to do his part in
making our party a reflex of the best
thought and best. Intent of sincere

CHICAGO, Junp 7.?Tlio West
Virginia delegation to the Repub

yesterday because of the primar

They took breakfast on the train,
and came direct to the convention

They planned to caucus in their

committal to the uplift and progress of
the American pooplo, theroby strength
ening party purpose i nstead of mogni
fying Individual belief, and he, too,
we find new rejoicing in being a
Republican. No party can endure
which is not progressive."
The world at war, preparedness and
America's foreign relaiohs served as
tho basis for the Senator's first dis
cussion of the issues. The enormity |
of the war in Enron?*, the tidal wave
of distress and disaster, new wonrf
land new hindrances in commerce had
utterly changed economic conditions,
and' "these have attended embarass
raents in "foreign American relations,"
.he. said, "astdiffipult as those which
jindivldual citizens exercise whose
^every neighbor is involved in deadly
quarrel.". ,
"Everything is abnormal except tbo
depleted condition of the Federal treaa
ury, 'which is characteristic of Demo
cratic control," he Bald, "and the facil
ity of the administration for writing
varied'notes without effective notlta"
Amid these conditions, America he as
sorted had been sigled out for leader
ship among the neutral powers "but
the administration at Washington
spoke with more rhetoric than resolu
tion, and we came to realize that the
waning powers soon came to know
that the official American voice lacked
the volume of determined expression
that once demanded international heed
and we lacked the strength and con*
fldence in our own defense."
In discussion of foreign relations
the temporary chairman made partlc
ular reference to Americanism, to the
course with Mexico and with Europe.
Beginning with Americanism he trac
ed'it back to Independence days when
there.were,. Americans from Great
Britain, from Germany, from France
and Southern Europe who made a com
mon cause. Since that time, he said,
America's gates had swung inward to
tho foreign born, and "they are an In
separable and important. part of our
American citizenship, and the few zea
lots of any origin who violate our neu
trality do not, and caunot Impugn the
loyalty the American patriotism of

swelling chorus of 'My country t'ls of
Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty*H.
