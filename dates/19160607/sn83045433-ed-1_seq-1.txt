(my the Intermattoua News %ervice-1
Petrograd, June 6.-The great Russian
offensIve continues to "develop Ac
cesses." to quote tonight's war offIcesa
npdest statement.
Last night the number of Austrian
prisoners on the Galiitan front was given
at 130wO and "a rumber of guns.-' To
night's official gives the prisoners as '4f
officers and more than 3M men, and
the number of cannon taken. twenty
seven guns and more than fifty machine
guns.
This Russian advance is anrther of the
Russian surprises of the war. Notwith
standing the tremendous number of the
men and the extent of the line--->, miles
frm the Pripet to the Roumanian fron
ticr. the offensive has taken the public
comiletely by surpri-e.
Th. element of Qec re-v has contributed
materially to the success with which the
operations were begun. At the same time,
the Austrians seem to have got wind of
the final preparations for the Russianl
move and the multiplying attacks of the
Ger mans on the Dvina are interpretedl
as attempts to create a diversIon in the
tnter est if the Austrians.
It is stated that the Austrians have on
this front about forty Infantry and ten
to fifteen cavalry divisions. That is more
than balf their total army. They have
the support of a couple of divisions of
Germans. The entire force to meet the
Russian attack will not exceed 6".01
men.
According to reports. the Austrians
have erected a series of formidable
barriers behind one another, each
faced by plantations of wire. They
have also supplemented the railway
system by lines parallel to their de
fens-s.
Time will be required tr hew a path
through these obstacles.
Quiet in Verdum Region.
Paris. June 6.-The day passed with
no infantry action on either side of
the Meuse in the Verdun region. Last
night the Germans repeated their at
tacks on the Vaux-Damloup front. de
livering two assaults, both of which
were repulsed.
According to unofficial reports from
the front. the German attacks of yes
terday lacked the intensity of recent
assaults, and French critics expressl
tie opinion that the Germans, as a
result of their heavy losses, are pro
ceeding more cautiously in their ef
forts against Fort Vaux, while reor
ganizing the forces involved.
The French war office announces to
night that Chief of Battalion Raynal,
the defender of Fort Vaux. has been
made a commander of the Legion of
Honor.

thicag., June 6.-It may have been the

the Republican old guard leaders. What
ever it was, it had the effect of chilling

They have been informei that the Re

that they should go outside of their

It remains for Roosevelt to say whether

urging the delegates to refrain from tak

know what the Republicans are going

Apprehension exists on the part of the
progressive leaders that their conventior

To guard against such a possibility the

oyster Bay, June 6.-Col. Roosevelt to
night emlhatically denied that he had
sent any message to Chicago agreeing t(
run on the Progressive ticket If Hughe

This, however, is not to be interpreted

exactly at its face value.
Col. Roosevelt has sent no message 01
any kind regarding any candidate or re.

arise.
No situation has yet arisen making it
necessary for Col. Roosevelt to say what
he will do with regard to the nominatior

ELIHU ROOT
T. R.'S CHOICE
Colonel Quoted by Newarl
Mayor'as Booming Former
Senator for White House.
ROOSEVELT SAID TO HAVE
SPOKEN WORDS OF EULOG1
Chicago, June 6.-Ellhu Root Is Col
Roosevelt's choice for the Republical
l'residential nomination, according to i
story told here today with a great dea
of circumstantial detalt The story wa
brought to Chicago by Mayor Raymond
o? Newark. N. J., and was related I
several leaders.
Mayor Raymond's story is to the effec
that he recently met Col. Roosevelt Il
Jersey City, and had a long talk wit
him on politics. In the course of th
conversation It was suggested by Col
Roosevelt that the Republican part
should nominate this year a man who ex
pressed strong views on the subject o
preparedness.
"Well, You and Ellhu Root are the on1
men named for the Republican Pres]
dentist nomination who have come ou
with the flat footed declarations on th
question.' suggested Mr. Raymond.
"And Leonard Wood, too." returned Co
Roosevelt.
Then the former President went on I
say that Mr. Root would make a fin
President and that he would like to se
him chosen. The former President di
not say that he would take any step
to help Root get the nomination, bu
he made it clear, according to Mr. Ray
mond. that he had no hard feeling fo
Mr. Root because of Root's opposition t
him in 1912.
In the course of this same conversa
tion, according to Mayor Raymond, -'ol
Roosevelt said on the question of pre
paredness there was little to choose be
tween Justice Hughes and President Wil
son. This, of course, was before th
speech on the flag delivered in Washing
ton yesterday by Mr. Hughes.
