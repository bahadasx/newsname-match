NEW COUNTY ACT IS VALI
Judge Moore Rules on Ground of "IIl
Shaped County" Clause-Back to
Higher Court.
Chester.-Judge Ernest Moore of
Lancaster, to whom the supreme
court referred the proceed.ing brought
by Septimus Massey et al. to restrain
the Catawba county commissioners
from ordering a survey and contract
ing other expense in connection witi
the new county on the ground that the
"ill shaped county" act clearly pro
hibits a county of such shape and the
survey would be unwarranted and un
necessary, handed down a decree it
which he sustained the attorneys rep
resenting the old counties and de
clared the act of the legislature under
attack to be sound law and not in con
flict with the constitution. The cas(
will be taken to the supreme court oz
appeal.
Judge Moore's decree upholds thi
contentions of J. H. Marion at ever,
point.
First, Col. Marion declared that thi
language of the constitution on thi
subject of creating new countise If
permissory, the use of the word "may
being in its ordinary acceptance an(
implying the right of the general as
sembly to safeguard the general rule,
and directions for erecting new coun
ties by adding to the same such salu
tary rules and regulations as migh
appear needful. Judge Moore concur
red in this interpretation and ruled ac
cordingly.
The claim that even if the languag'
of the constitution on the subject o
erecting new counties is mandatory
the legislature has the -right to sut
stitute a method for the general meth
ed provided was also upheld.
The third point, citing the police
power vested in the legislature ani
other bodies to guard the rights o
citizens by the enactment of laws ii
,conflict with general rights vouch
safed by the constitution, if such al
pear necessary, was also sustained.
Judge Moore then takes up the at
gument: advanced by Col. A. L. Gat
ton, in regard to the constitutions
conven'tion's attitude towards th
creation of new counties, and diapose
of the argument of Catawba count:
proponents to the effect that a prc
vision in regard to the shape of ne'
counties was voted down by the cor
vention by showing that this was don
in order that the legislature, to whot
as representatives of the people sucl
subjects are referred, might not b
hampered in their treatment of th
subject. Mr. Welch dwelt upon th
convention's failure to incorporat
into the constitution a provision a

Schools Share in State Fund.
At the first meeting of the state
board cf education after the opening
of the scholastic year 1915-16 it was
seen that the high school appropria
tion would fall not far from $10,000
short of meeting the applications for
state aid. The board sent a notice
to every state-aided high school noti
fying it that it would probably be able
to get no high school money beyond
what is known as the initial appropri
" ation-that is, a limit of $500 for any
high school with two or more teach
ers and a limit of $300 for a high
" school with fewer than two teachers.
At the May meeting of the state board
" of education it was found that a few
hundred dollars was left unapportion
ed and the board directed that this
small residue be distributed as
equitably as possible among the most
deserving schools.
The final apportionments have been

urers. First, all high schools with one
full high school teacher, as much as
half the time of a second high school

"Well, since then, I hear the film

habitual movie patrons have fallen in

they can read the lips of real people
just as well, hence my warning."

such persons."
"Don't take any chances. You'd
probably be surprised to know how
many people not deaf-mutes have that
little accomplishment more or less
developed. It seems with some to be
a natural gift. I heard a woman tell
the other day, of a conversation she
'saw' between two friends sitting at
the other end of a street car. Now just
suppose those friends had been indulg

her!"
"It isn't pleasant to think of," she
said. "Is there to be no privacy ex

no electrical connections? I read
somewhere the other day that a man
is working .on a machine that' will
catch our thought emanations even
when we don't speak. Isn't It awful!
And yet if messages can be sent across
the world by wireless, is such an in

that we can't have our thoughts to our

Quite an extensive crawfish Indus

there is no protection, and vast
amounts of them are caught off the
rocky coast. They are shipped to nu

their cousins, both in taste and appear.

U1TLE BUT A MEMORY
FAMOUS BATTLESHIP OREGON.
HAS HAD ITS DAY.
Seventeen Years Ago She Was Prot'
ably the Most Famous Vessel
Afloat-Now Ia Relegated to
a Minor Position.
Seventeen years ago the name of
the Oregon was on the lips of every
American. It. had rounded the Horn
on a record-breaking voyage of 18,000
miles and then won additional renown
in the battle of Santiago bay. The
Oregon was the pride of Uncle Sam
the queen of the seas. For years, how
ever, it has been out of date. Omfciali
It has been rated as a second-class ves
ael; by the more Sippant as junk.
Now the navy department has got rid
of it by prescnting it to the state of
California for use by - naval militia.
So runs the world a way-for battle
ships as well as for nen, observes the
Sioux City Journal.
Who that recalls the war with Spain
will ever forget the Oregon? Foresee.
lng a break with Spain, Washington
ordered it to sail from Mare Island
navy yard at San Francisco to Key
West. The long distance run proved
to be a most spectacular undertaking.
War was declared while the Oregon
was on itsw.ay, and fears for its safe
ty were entertained until it hove in
sight, reports having been set afloat
that Spain had sent out a fleet to in
tercept it. The long trip was remark
able for the fact that the battleship
stopped nowhere except for coal and
was not delayed an hour by any break
down in its machinery. Capt. Charles
Edgar Clark was in command, and his
name became almost as famous as
that of the Oregon. He is one of the -
few of those who took leading roles
in the Spaniah-American war who are
still alive.
Nor did the. Oregon rest on its
laurels after it had steamed into Key
West late in May, 1898. It had: been
brought from the Pacifc to the Atlan
tic for business, and that business was
to fight. It proceeded at once to San
tiago and in the battle of July 8 with
Admiral Cervera's Beet was in the
thick of the trouble from the first to
last. To the Oregon belongs credit
for forcing the surrender of the Viz
caya and the Christobal Colon and
possibly for saving the Brooklyn, the -
flagship of Commodore Schley.
Yet today this one time bulldog of
the navy is not considered of enough
account in the .national armament to
be kept in the service! So many
changes have come about in the mak
ing of battleships the once wonderful
Oregon is now a ft subject for the
scrap heap. It was a .reat vessel in'
its day, and around it cluster hal -
lowed memories, but more than that
cannot be said for it.
Let anyone who has a notion that
the United States navy has not been
growing in the last twenty years com
pare a list of the vessels which then
made up our defense at sea with a list
of the vessels of 1915. Where then
the Iowa, the Indiana and others stood
proudly at the head of the procession
now they humbly fall In far behind the
Arizona, the Pennsylvania and others
of later make and more generous pro
portions. Yet the Arizona's day and
the Pennsylvania's day also will come,
as has come that of the Oregon, and
as came that of the Monitor and that
of Old Ironsides.

Measles Yield to Serum.
An entirely new treatment of mea
sles Is reported by Dr. Umberto Ma
oli in Il Policlinlco. It consists in
the removal of blood serum from con
valescents and Injecting it into pa
tients in the acute stage. of the dis
ease. Doctor Majoll tried it during
an epidemic of measles at Ancona,
and with great success. He gave in
Ijections from 5 to 20 cubic centime
ters of a mixed serum obtained from
several convalescents. The effect was
to lower the disease and prevent com
plications. The Medical Record notes
that a similar treatment has been used
