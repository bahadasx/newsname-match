The gorgeous yellow and white
bunting decorations fitted the, drafo
ness of the outside in a little more
mellow glow inside the hall and
helped the dampened anT chilled
spirit to thaw out and dry*out a trifle.
Gaudy ribbons that had once been
badges and had curled up on the wa
ter-soaked coats of the delegates and
spectators, begin to unklnk and perk
up a little. So did the wearers of
these badges. Then began the ever
lasting talk, talk, the buzz, trtizz of
conversation that welled up In a con
tinuous roar of noise, the roar shat
tered now and then by the crack of
yells for some favorite son or greet
ings for some delegate.
Here in the convention hall, as in
the hotel lobbies, the principal topic
of conversation was Roosevelt and
Hughes. The G. O. P.-ites were very
much Interested in what was about
to happen a mile or so north in the
Auditorium, where the bull moose co
horts were presumably singing "On
ward Christian Soldiers," and doing
other Mooseish things. The concen
sus of opinion was that Roosevelt was
done with the republican convention
—but then, you never can tell, espe
cially when there was so much talk
and George Perkins was supposed to
be equalling the pussyfooting per
formances of Murray Crane.
Going back to schedule again, the
convention met to talk and expected
to talk for perhaps three hours. Then
there was to be a two hour stoppage
of the organized talk, so to speak—
that is, the convention was to ad
journ until tomorrow—after which
the verbal volleys were to be formal
ly resumed at an opened session of
the resolutions committee. Most of
the platform is already drafted, but
the free and untrammelled right to
talk is sacred at conventions and
there are plenty of individuals with
cough-dropped throats, ready to exer
cise it—the right—and then—the
throats. Probably this session of
forensic fervor will last until late to
night. Then the. resolutions commit
tee win appoint a sub-committee
which will do the real heavy work of
building the platform and do
through an all night vigil.
Tomorrow they will have It ready
to submit to the convention.
It was 11:28 when Chairman Hille3*
gavel fell. Contrary to the usual sit
uation, he had little trouble in obtain
ing quiet, the delegates appearing
eager to be quiet and assist in getting
the show under way.
"This is a year," he said, "whatever
may have been true of past years,
when politics is patriotism and pat
riotism Is politics. Therefore th£
audience will please arise and sing
America."
Prayer was then offered by Rev.
John Timothy Stone of Chicago. It
was then 11:38. The divine prayer was
for peace, asking blessings for the de
liberations of the meeting and plead
ing for "no hasty or ill spoken words."
May the men of our choice be
those of your choice.' he said.
Everybody then sat quiet while the
photographer did his worst.

On the first ballot Hughes will

... COttjISBUM, dUQAGO, June 7.—
Bwler the handicap of a drab.dull
day, with a rain soaked assemblage,
the republican national convention
got under way today. The weather
'was plainly on the nerves of the
delegates, who quieted down at 11:28
when Chairman Hilles' gavel fell
twenty-eight minutes after the time
set.
It wasn't until Temporary Chair

up himself and warmed his rain

navy "that fears none in the world."
Applause that lasted through a min
ute of frenzied cfteers greeted his
declaration that the 'United States
should "not be too proud to fight."
Harding greeted an audience that

The republicans convened without
any sign of any sort of agreement on
the candidate who they will select.
It was still Hughes and Roosevelt
and Burton and Fairbanks, and all
the rest, with nobody knowing ex

was no doubt that the G. O. P. con

G. 0. P. AND BVLL MOOSE CONVENE
LONDON, June 7—A marked stimu
lus to recruiting today—the last day
under the voluntary group system—
and a general demand for the intern
ment of all enemy aliens in Great
Britain, regardless of age, sex or nat
uralization, are the immediate result
ants of the death of Lord Kitchener.'
There Is possibility of a political
struggle In the back ground concern
ing the appointment of his successor.
This lies in the fact that some be
lieve t(ie post should go to a civilian,
while others are for the appointment
of a military man, preferably Sir
William Robertson, chief of staff. He
could not serve as secretary of state
for war without being raised to the
peerage or occupying a seat In the
house of commons.
One commoner has already ex
pressed willingness to yield his seat
to Robertson. Still a third -way would
be to appoint a peer with the under
standing that Robertson have full
away.
Lloyd-George, minister of muni
tions, is one civilian who has been
spoken of for the place.
The demand for the Internment of
aliens grows out of the fact that be
lief is almost Britain wide that the
Germans knew exactly of the move
ments of Lord Kltcheneh. The Morn
ing Post says:
"Circumstances point to espionage
or treachery, and the country will sus
pect this the more owing to the singu
lar freedom still allowed to enemy
subjects to Great iBrltain.
The NOrthcliffe group asks that In
ternment of aliens of belligerent ori
gin take place at once.

editorials on Kitchener, the man, are

Committee on Platform.
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 7.—
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts was
elected chairnian of the resolutions
committee immediately after the or
ganization meeting of the convention
was called.
Chas. P. Scott of Kansas was elec
ted secretary of the resolutions coci
mlttee. Lodge was authorized to ap
point a sub-commltte if nine, him
self to be one, to draft the platform.
The committee then adopted a' tn
tion for a public hearing at the Coli
seum at four p. m. One hour and a
half will be given over to advocates
and opponents of woman suffrage.

CHICAGO, June 7.—Alice (Roose

Congressman Nick Liongworth, into
holding hands" with her French maid
on their arrival here in order to de
ceive a flock of newspaper photo
graphers who were on the job to
snap the colonel's daughter.
Several of the snapshot artists
focussed through the fog and gloom
and brought 'back to their city edi

them appeared in print, today.
While Longrworth was walking

the Susan B. Anthony amendment as

Theo. Roosevelt," admitted that he
did not expect it to do the former.

deaf ear to his further entreaties.
In similar terms, the progressives,
socialists and prohibitionists paid
their court. The latter two, although
pledging to share their all with the
new party, were flatly rejected as not
having any power to share. The pro
gressives were kindly but firmly told
that though their professions sounded

A few hours before the convention
was scheduled to open, Perkins de
clared he was still hopeful of affect
ing adjustment with republicans.
Borah, who probably will have much
to say dn drafting the republican plat
form, talked with Colonel Roosevelt
at Oyster Bay by telephone early to
day. It was rumored Borah offered
to let him dictate the platform, step
inside and throw his support to
Hughes.
Steps toward harmony were plan
ned by Perkins and'Wm. H. Chi Ids to
follow immediately after Raymond
Robin, temporary chairman of the
convention, continued his keynote
speech. The plan called for a reso
lution naming a 'committee to confer
officially with a similar committee
from the republican convention, to
decide on a platform and a candi
date mutually agreeable and effect a
reunion 'of republicans and progres
sives, if possible. Wihijte's clan of
