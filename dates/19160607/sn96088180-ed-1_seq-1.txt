Republicans Organize With
Senator Hardisg as the
Tecpcrary Chairman, and
tenittees Are Appointed
Coliseum, Chicago, June 7. Under
the handicap of a drab, dull day, with
a rain-soaked assemblage, the repub
lican national convention got under
way today. The weather was plainly
on the nervee of the delegates, who
quieted down at; 11:18 when Chair
man Hllles' gavel fell 28 minutes af
ter the time set. . . V
It waa not until Temporary Chair
man Harding had gotten well along
In hla keynote speech that the air
really warmed op. 'The Obloan, re
puted to be one ot the handsomest
men in the United States senate, and
a polished speaker, drew the flrat old
fashioned hall-rocking, spontaneous
applause when, having warmed up
himself and warmed bin raJn-eoaked
audience, he pleaded for a navy "that
fears none In the world," applause
that lasted through a minute ot f ren
xled cheer greeted his declaration
that the United States should not be
"too proud to Agbt."
Harding greeted an audteaoe that
waa wet and cold, freezing with ap
proaching cold and uncomfortable In
the musty atmosphere ot the great
ball. He got merely a polite recep
tion at first, but ai" his polished
phrases sank into tbe audience be
gradually warmed the air.
The 16,000 began to forget their
sniffles, tbelr cold, feet and wet
clothe.
The republican convened without
any algn of any sort ot agreement on
the candidate whom they will select.
It was still Hughes and Roosevelt and
Burton and Fatrbanka and all the
rest, with nobody knowing exactly
what would happen. There was no
doubt that the 0. 0. iP, convention
wa mightily Interested In what wa
happening and about to happen at the
Auditorium, where those who broke
the bonds four years ago were hold
ing conference.
That there would be an attempt for
a get-together meeting ot committees
from both conventions was certain.
At least one resolution waa to be In
troduced suggesting a combination of
Interests. ,
It was 11:28 , when' Chairman
Hllles' gavel tell.1 Contrary to the
usual situation, he had little trouble
lu obtaining, quiet, the, delegates ap
pearing eager to assist in getting the
show under way. : ;
"This Is a year," he said,' "what
ever may have been true of past
years, when politics Is patriotism and
patriotism la politics. Therefore the
audience will please arise and Blng
'America'."..., .
. Prayer iu then ottered by Rev.
John Timothy Stone, ot Chicago.
The divine prayed for peace, ask
ing blessings for the deliberations ot
the meeting and pleading for "no
hasty or ill-spoken word."
"May the men ot our choice be
those of your choice," he aald.
Secretary James iB. Reynolds next
read the official call for the conven
tion, being greeted with good-natured
applause. Tbe reading was not
audible to more than 60 persons.
Chairman Hllles next presented
Senator Warren 0. Harding of Ohio
a temporary chairman, taking a
single sentence for this function.
Harding's name, got a goodly burst
of applause. ..-
'Hllles appointed a a committee to
escort the Ohloan to the platform,
Crane, Borah and McKlnley of
IlllnoU. ,
, Somebody yelled that Borah had
not arrived, aud Crane and McKlnley
theu undertook 4he Job alone. As

The bull moose national convention
adjourned thla afternoon, until J p. m.
tomorrow after staging a record

that lasted for an hour and thirty-

will be effected tomorrow.
, The conservative ball mooeers were
hopeful, this afternoon that they
might force Roosevelt upon the re
publican party. ' They believed the
demonstration that rocked the Audi
torium thla afternoon would convince
the O. 0. P. that Roosevelt Is the on
ly man that both the republicans and
progressives can agree on and elect
Auditorium, Chicago, June 7.
The progressive national convention
went wild S5 minute after It assembl
ed today at the flrat mention of Theo
dore Rosevelfs name en the platform
The delegate cheered, Veiled, shout
ed, Jumped up In the air and waved
banners and everything else they
could find, when Temporary Chair
man Robins named Roosevelt as the
"greatest leader of hla time," one
minute after he had atarted speaking.
"The nation la clamoring for one
man Roosevelt," Robins declared in
his keynote speech.
Robins named the colonel as the
"bravest and wiaest leader ot onr
time, the foremost private cltlsen ot
the world."
- "We have listened for months to
the wrangling voices ot the selfish,
harrow groups," said Robins. "What
we want ia the nation' favorite sob,
not the tavorite aon of one state,
i Declaring "that we should apeak
plainly to our brothers in spirit, and
especially In the republican party,"
Robins warned 'those of an easy and
accomodating political virtue that
will not surrender a principle."
Then the Roosevelt demonstration
fbegen, delegates seising a big banner
and carrying it to the stage.
Pennsylvania followed, with Cali
fornia, North Dakota, Texaa and Col
orado falling into line. Within a
minute practically all the state dele
gation standards were planted in a
cluster about the speaker' stand.
As the demonstration proceeded,
the riotoua mob of cheering dele
gate crushed so closely about Rob
Ins and Murdock that the two were
completely lost from sight. Drums
beat, moose horns tooted, and every
body yelled In a bedlam ot sound.
They were all primed and ready for
the start after days of waiting.
The entire crowd sang "We want
Teddy," until the arches of the Au
ditorium nearly cracked under the
volume ot sound. Finally they got
tired ot singing It, and yeltod It.
The band played all the patriotic
songs It knew, and started to repeat
them. Robins let the crowd have Its
head and made no attempt to check
the demonstration.
As dosens ot delegates marched in
single-tile In front ot the speaker
stand. Perkins climbed on a table
above the crowd and held an Im
promptu reception, , shaking hands
with the progressive delegates and
beating time to the music. At 1 : B
p. m., when the demonstration had
been on for 23 minutes and was
apparently dying down,.,; the , band
started It again with the "Onward
Christian 8oldlers'! battle song.

SUCCESSOR TO.
EARL KITCIIEIIEn
IS DISCUSSED
London, June 7. A marked tim-
ulus to recruiting today the last day
under the voluntary group system -and
a general demand for the intern
ment of all enemy aliens In Great
Britain, regardless of age, sex or ns-
turalliatlon, are the Immediate -re
sults of the death of Lord Kitchener.
There is possibility of a political
struggle is the background concern
ing the appointment of his successor.
This lies in the fact that some: be
lieve the port should go to s civilian.
while etfen-s are for the appointment
of a military man, preferably Sir
William Robertson, chief of staff. He
Could sot serve as secretary of state
for war without being raised to the
peerage or occupying a seat in the
houae of commons. One commoner
already has expressed willingness to
yield his seat to Robertson. Still a
third way would be to appoint s peer
with the understanding that Robert'
son have full sway. -
: Lloyd-George, minister of muni
Hons, la one civilian who has been
spoken of for the place. ' ff
The demand for the Internment of
aliens grows out of the fact that the
belief ia almost nation-wide that the
Germane knew exactly ot the move
ments of Earl Kitchener. The Morn,
ing Post says:
"Circumstances point to espionage
or treachery, . and the country will
suspect this the more owing to the
singular freedom etilL allowed to en
emy subjects of Great Britain."
TM Northcllffe group of news
papers urge the internment ot per
sona of belligerent origin take place
at once.
The Northcllffe papers, too. In thelf
editorials on Kitchener, the man, are
in accord with ail others in their
warm praise ot his work.
The Morning ' Post urges Lord
Milner as Kitchener's logical suc
cessor, and holds that the appoint
ment ot Lloyd-George would be a mis
take. ",

waa the keynote and party, unity was
the plea of . Temporary' Chairman
Harding's speech, formally opening
the republican convention today.
"We did not do very well in mak
ing for harmony the last time w
met," Harding said in opening his
address. "The country has regretted;
let ua forget- and make amends to
our country. We did not divide over
fundamental principles; we did not
disagree over a national policy. We
split over methods ot party proce
dure and preferred personalities.
"The allied hosts ot the believers
In republican principles are in a vast
majority in this country when the
banners ot harmony are unfurled.
We have seen the re-enlistment of
those who believe In republican doc
trines. Re-dedicating here and now
the republican party to progress and
glory ot the republic, let us bury
party preferences."
Harding expressed the belief that
there waa not a reactionary republi
can bearing credentials In the con
vention, and added "No party can
endure which 1a not progressive. I
know the republican party Is genu
inely progressive and effective." '
After extending the olive branch
to the progressives, In convention at
the Auditorium, Harding outlined the
fundamentals on which the party
planned to reconstruct its power. At
the same time he flayed the Wilson
administration, ' concluding) that
