POLICE GET NEW CAR;
FIREMENJVHJST WAIT
Not Enough Money in the
City Treasury for Both,
Says the Council.
SWEEPER IS BOUGHT
Refuses Request of Machine
Gun Company for Free
Light and Water.
The City Council last night, in a
session lasting well over three hours,
decided
That Columbia would not hae a
new fire chemical wagon for the
present, at least;
That an automobile be purchased
for the use of the police department
in making arrests and inspections;
That a new street sweeper be pur
chased; That the hours ot the night police
be shortened from twelve to ten;
That no action should be taken to-
ward giving the machine gun com-
pany free light and water.
I.ack of sufficient funds was given
as the reason for failing to purchase
the new fire truck. Practically tUe
entire council seemed to favor the
purchase and think it necessary, but
after Councilman Shaw, who was
chairman in the absence of Mayor
Ilatterton, reported there was only
about $11,000 in the city treasury,
which has to last until about Octo
ber 1, the matter was deferred until
the next budget is made, which will
be about July 1.
(.'ood Points Brought Out.
The fire truck company was rep
resented by h. J. Lovelace, who gave
a demonstration with the car before
the meeting. Chief Kurtz explained
that practically three-fourths of the
fires in Columbia could be handled
with the proposed truck and called
attention to the fact that if Colum
bia should ever have two fires at the
same time which is a 500-to-l chance,
according to Councilman Kellogg
that the case would be hopeless with
only one truck. He also pointed out
that most of the fires could be handl
ed with the smaller truck, which is
cheaper to operate than the larger
one.
Councilman Shaw, chairman of the
finance committee, when called on for
a statement as to the financial possi
bility of the city purchasing the car,
said that the police car. street sweep
er and fire truck could not all be
purchased this year.
On the recommendation of the po
lice committee, the council voted to
nmvh.-isn n small motor car for the
use of the nolice dei.artment in mak-
ing arrests and inspections.

sweeper spoke before the council and
verified Reed's statements, after
which the council authorized the
street committee to buy a sweeper.
The night police will not have to
work so hard during the summer
months as during the winter, for the
police committee recommended that
the hours be shortened from twelve
to ten. One man will go on at S
o'clock in the evening and be relieved
at r, o'clock the next morning; an
other will go on at fi o'clock in the
evening and be relieved at 4 o'clock
in the morning. The council passed
on this recommendation with the pro
vision that it be changed if it Is con-j
tradictory to any orders previously
given by Mayor Batterton in regard to
the hours of the night police.
No I'aiors for (Jim Compuiiy.
The local machine gun company of
the National Guard asked that it hae
water and light free. This was not act
ed on favorablv. Councilman Walker

council to the fact that the state has,

To llaic Adjourned .Meeting;
An ordinance to establish a grade
on Walnut street from Melbourne
street to Moss street was discussed
by the council. An adjourned meet
ing will be held .Monday night to
take up this and other matters.
The council refused to order a side
walk on University avenue from Couz
ins street to Bluff street.
It was decided to settle the taxes
for Christian College on the same
basis as the settlement made by the
county court.
Councilman Kellogg notified the
council that at the next meeting he
would introduce a model health ord
inance. Bids for printing the tax receipts
were opened and the contract award
ed to the Columbia Printing Com
pany. X'ew Councilman Itusy.
Councilman Walker brought up a
list of things "as long as his arm,"
he said that he wanted acted on. He
called attention to the topping of trees
and unncccessary cutting of brandies
in stringing wires. He pointed out
that the west wall of the Boone Coun-
ty .Milling Company was in danger of
falling, that the stone wall by .Mrs.
.Martin's property in Ninth street was
in a dangerous condition and that it
bulged out a foot over the sidewalk.
Walker said he had called the mayor's
attention to this and that Mayor Ilat
terton had replied that "Mrs. Martin
is responsible." Walker said that
this would not repair broken legs,
however.
The walk in front of the Douglas
property on Ninth street was another
cause of objection by Mr. Walker.
He also brought up the matter of hav
mg me eity onunances revised, inese
matters were all referred to the prop-
er committees to be acted on at a

"FAILURE IN MEXICO"
Temporary Cha:rman Opens
Convention by Asking
All to Prepare.
By United Press.
CHICAGO, June 7. Senator War
ren G. Harding's keynote speech to the
Republican National Convention today
sent the water-soaked delegates in a
wild freirzy. He said the Unitea
States should fear no power in the
world and asked for the biggest navy
in the world and an army second to
none. The l.l.ooo present sent loose
cheers that rocked the great hall.
Harding had to pound with his gavel
incessantly for order.
Senator Harding said:
Takes Up the World War.
".Much of the discussion of the
hour is hinged upon a world at war.
There is a tidal wave or distress and
disaster; there are violent emotions
and magnified fears. Everything is
abnormal except the depleted condi
tion of the Federal treasury, which is
characteristic of Democratic control,
and the facility of the administration
for writing varied notes without ef
fective notice.
"Whatever the ultimate solution
may be, history will write Mexico as
the title to the humiliating recital of
tne greatest fiasco in our foreign re
lations. Under the pretext of non-in

"There has come to us a conviction

sources and strong in patriotic man
hood, has been negligent concerning

PREPAREDNESS RINUS
KEYNOTE FOR MOOSE
Raymond Robins, Temporary
Chaiaman, Sounds Policy
in Opening Speech.
SEES BUT ONE MAN
Cry of Delegates Is "We
Want Roosevelt" Many
Demonstrations Made.
By United Press.
CHICAGO, June 7. The Progressive
National Convention was called to or
der at 12:27 o'clock this afternoon by
Victor Murdock of Kansas, chairman
of the national committee. There
were wild cries of "We Want Teddy"
and the like while Murdock pounded
for order.
The keynote speech by Raymond
Robins, temporary chairman, was a
plea for preparedness. The speaker
discussed the break in the Republican
ranks four years ago.
The Michigan delegation was the
first to reach the scene, carrying a
Rooseelt banner, and the convention
went wild with cheers. Robins again
started his speech on Americanism.
When the Texas delegation armed
there was more cheering.
Mr. Robins said in part:
Would Apportion Cost.
"I.et us see to it that the money cost
of armament shall be borne by that
property which is safeguarded and by
that commerce on the highways of
the world which the American flag is
once again promptly and surely to
protect. I.et us see t; it that the hu
man cost in service under arms shall
be borne equally by all our citizenry.
Personal freedom is equally dear to
all and the freedom of the state is the
common heritage of all, so that each
man of military age should be pre
pared to defend that which is his own.
In that last resort of a ciWlized peo
ple an appeal to arms the self
respecting citizen of a republic will do
his own lighting. He will not wish to
hire men to die for him.
"We want no military caste in this
republic. We will have none if each
man serves his training time and then
returns to civil life better physically
and with a better understanding of the
facts of war. We need have no fear
of war being brought on needlessly in
a nation where the entire voting pop
ulation knows what war means to
modern men. With universal sufS
frage and universal service there will
be no needless wars. The jingoes and
the timid will be as acutely interested
in a call to the colors as the quiet
and courageous and we may be as
sured of ieace as long as there can
be a righteous peace. And we can be
assured that in the terrible event of
war the fighting will be done by those
who made the war and not by brave
victims of selfish ambition and
treacherous greed.
Industrial! Prepared, Too.
"But modern warfare it not merely
a matter of armament and men. If v
are to make our preparedness a peace
insurance, it must be adequate. We
must organize the vast resources of
natioI1 so that In suddem need,
without a costly period of industrial
chaos, the equipment, the munitions,
the food supply and transportation for
large armies will be immediately at
the service of the government. Ameri
ca trained, armed and ready, will be
a nation practically assured of peace.
America unarmed, untrained or un
ready, will be a nation practically as
sured of war.
"Nor is this industrial preparedness
of immediate necessity for military
defense alone, for it will provide for
our future commercial pru.siwij.
When the war is over, we shall face
the most effective industrial competi
tion that the world has ever known.
