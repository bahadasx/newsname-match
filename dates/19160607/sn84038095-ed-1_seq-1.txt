Monday's Primary Results In Nomina'
tlon of Lieu|t. Gov. Harding for
Governor by Big Majority.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE IS DEFEATED
Moeller Defeats Cochran for County
Clerk, Receiving 783 Votes Against
557—Denison Against Suffrage
I i.
The primary election held in Iowa
Monday resulted in the nomination of
Lieut. Governor VV. L. Harding for
governor on the republican ticket by
a majority which will equal almost 50
per cent of the entire republican votes
of the state. Woman suffrage was de
feated by a majority of 5,000. It is
estimated that the total vote in the
state will run above the 300,000 mark.
The total vbte cast on the suffrage
question in the ninety-four counties
from which returns were received was
£84.049. The great size of the repub
lican vote cast is indicated by the
fact that 204,709 votes on governor
were cast in eighty-live counties, it
is believed that many of theso votes
were c^st by wet democrats who had
switched their affiliations In order to
vote for Harding. The total democrat
ic vote cast will probably fall below
100,000.
The Governorship.
From returns received from eighty
live counties out of the ninety-nine of
the state it appears that Harding re
ceived 96,930, Cosson 46,777, Allen
36,491, Kuehnle 13,811. Of coursc the
result' of the gubernatorial fight Is a
great disappointment to the friends of
Mr. Kuehnle in Crawford county and
Denison. For more than a week his
closest friends realized that the light
between the wets and drys would
eliminate him from the race. In every
county in the state both factions had
organizations perfected and it was
clearly a fight between Mr. Harding
representing the liberal element on
one side, and Mr. Cosson and Mr. Al
len, representing the drys on the oth
er. Crawford county gave Mr. Kuehn
le a great endorsement, his total vote
in tho county being 726, almost twice
as many as was polled by Harding.
Denison stood loyally by its home can
dldate, giving him 247 votes, which
was twice as many as the combined
votos of tlre other three candidates
While the outcome is of course disap
pointing, everyone feels that Mr.
Kuehnle made a good showing, taking
everything into consideration. Mr.
Kuehnle made a clean fight foF the
office and his campaign throughout
i/
v.inspired
was conducted along lones which no
one could question.
Woman Suffrage Defeated.
Considerable interest was manifest
on the .question of equal suffrage, and
the result as a whole is surprising. It
had been supposed that usffrage would
carry in the state and that the vote
in the larger cities would be so large
to'favor of it that it Would overcome
that' of the rural districts where it
was thought the majority would be
against the proposition. In the citier
it was almost an even break and some
of the larger cities where it was ex
pected to carry small majorities
aeainst the movement were found. The
eifst Iowa river counties gave tremen
dous votes against suffrage, while the
heaviest vote in favor of suffrage was
cast in the middle section of the state.
State Nominations.
E. R. Moore undoubtedly is riominat
ed for lieutenant governor. In fifty
eight counties he has 8,000 more than
the required 35 per cent.
W. C. Brown leads for state treas
urer. (In fiftyfsix counties he has
2,300 votes over C. H. Thomas.
The nomination for attorney genera'
and railroad commissioner must br
made' by the convention unless late
returns revolutionize the half of the
counties reported.
9
Commissioner Guiher loads for re
nomination for railroad commissione
and George Wilson leads for attorney
general.
W. S. Allen was renominated for
secretary of state, three to one. ac
cording to early returns.
In the Tenth congressional distrlc'
Congressman Frank P. Woods was re
nominated by a vote of two to one
over his opponent, Chris Ottosen.
The Results in Crawford.
Here in Crawford county there were
cast 1516 votes for governor, Kuehnlr
l'ecelving 726, Harding 448, Cosson 238
Mr. Kuehnle carried every precinct
in the county with the exception of,
Iowa, Nishnabotny, Hayes, Willow
West Side and Jackson. Harding re
ceived 448 votes, Cosson 238 and Aller
a poor fourth with only 104.
Denison stood by its home candidate
loyally, he receiving 247 votes, which
is over twice as many as the combined
vote of the other three candidates.
In the contest for lieutenant gov
ernor on the republican ticket. James
It. Hanna, of Des Moines, received the
most votes in the county, his vote be
ing 571, with Earnest T. Mooro receiv
ing 558 and Henry Brady 217- Craw
ford gave William S. Allen, candidate
for secretary of state, 987 votes, while
R. R. Hasselquist received 367. C. H.
Thomas, for treasurer of state, re
ceived 566 votes. Edward H. White 413
and William C. Drown 335.

DENISON COLLEGE
Baccalaureate Sermon Delivered by
iRev. Tourteilot Sunday Evening
at Methodist Church.
CLASS PLAY LAST EVENING
Proved Excellent Production and Well
Merited the Large Attendance-^
Many Appreciative Remarks
'yThe baccalaureate sermon, address
ed to tho members of the graduating
class of the Denison Normal & Busi
ness college and a largo assemblage
of friends, was delivered by ltev. J.
C. Tourteilot, pastor of the Presby
terian Church, on last Sunday evening
the services being held iu, the First
Methodist Episcopal church of this
city. The church had been very pret
tily decorated with spring flowers, a
profusion of snow balls forming a
blanket on a background of blue. A
much appreciated selection was ren
dered by the college quartet as an
opening feature of tho service.. The
sermon, dwelling upon the wise in
vestment of llfo. was inspirational and
helpful, the speaker endeavoring to
impress the young students with the
necessity of proper education and
preparation for life's work. Ho stat
ed that all the education one can ob
tain is of no avail except in the op
portunities which it affords for serv
ice to one's fcllowmen. He urged the
young people to be of service to some
one, not being content to live unto
themselves and making the world no
better for their having been a part
of it.
The play presented by the 1910
graduating class of the Denison Nor
mal & Business college at the Ger
mania opera house on last evening
was an excellent production and well
merits the many appreciative remarks
which are being made by those who
were among the audience. "Tho Tyr
anny of Tears" w^s the play staged
by the class under the direction
of MiSB Loretta VanNess, of the col
lege faculty, who is deserving of much
credit for the training of the charac
ters as well as for the settings of tho
play. The costumes were charming
and added beauty to the various
scenes, one of the most delightful of
which was that of the Rose garden de
picted in act three of the play.
The cast of characters, including
but seven members of the graduating
class was indeed a credit to the entire
membership. Hubert VanNess as Mr
Parbury, an author, and Carl Krauth,
his friend, George Gunning were ex
ceedingly fine in their roles, ap­
