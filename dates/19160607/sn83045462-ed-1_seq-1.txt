LONDON". June 7.?The British
army went into mourning todav
for its late chief, Earl Kitch
ener. Every officer wore a band
of crepe on his left arm. Throughont
the country flags were at halfv
mast.
There was. of course, no suspension
of activities having to do
with the prosecution of the war,
and at the war office and other
governmental departments officials
continued to work out details
of the scheme which Earl
Kitchener formulated. Premier
Asquith has taken charge of the
war office.
Flood of Condolences.
From allied and neutral countries
the dominions, colonies and dependencies
came a flood of cablegrams expressing
sympathy. In the dominions,
Including South Africa, legislatures adjourned
as a mark of respect for the
dead leader. The news was received
in the South African assembly during
discussion of the estimates. Premier
Botha, who was deeply affected, made
an immediate announcement and moved
adjournment, while the members.
Dutch and British, remained standing
as a tribute to the man who won the
dominion for Great Britain against the
forces in which many cf the legislators
fought.
Newspapers and many commerciaJ
organizations have taken up the demand
for immediate interment of aliens
from enemy nations on the ground
that the Germans may have been advised
from England of Earl Kitchener's
departure, and that such knowledge
may have been responsible for
the destruction of the Hampshire.
In connection, with suggestions that
Information of Earl Kitchener's movements
may have "been conveyed to
the Germans by spies, it is interesting
to note that the Official <iazette last
night contained an order placing new
restrictions on passengers landing at
po-ts in the Orkney Islands. Hencefo-th
no person may land at such ports
without specific permission of the military
authorities at Kirkwall.
On Way to See Czar.
An official statement issued says that
Earl Kitchener was to have discussed
Important military and financial questions
with Emperor Nicholas. He was
going at the request of the Russian
government. He .intended to land at
Archangel and visit Petrograd, and
probably go to the Russian front. His
mission had chiefly to do with the
supply of munitions for Russia. The
earl expected to be back in London for
the reopening of parliament June 20.

when the newspapers appeared Friday
evening with the first intelligence of
the naval battle in the North sea in the
form of a list of the ships lost, with
virtually no intimation -that there was
any compensation in the way of enemy
losses. The bulletin telling of the
death of Kitchener gave the country
even a greater shock.
Held Public's Confidence.
Kitchener was the one outstanding personality
w*om the people talked of and
believed 11 as a great man, notwithstanding
newspaper attacks, which at a former
period of the war threatened to undermine
his popularity and the public
confidence in hirn.
The English undoubtedly are a stoical

CHICAGO, June ~.?New York
republicans supporting Justice
Hughes said today that they were
informed from reliable sources
two days ago that under no circumstances
would Col. Roosevelt
support Justice Hughes if he
were" nominated by the republican
convention.
The report that Col. Roosevelt
would favor a third party ticket
if Hughes were the republican
nominee brought forth the statement
from the Hughes men.
Not Considered Bad News.
Gov. Whitma i. leader of the Hughes
faction of the New York delegates,
smiled when he was told of the reported
Roosevelt statement.
"I don't consider that bad new^, do
you?" he said. "I have thought all
along that Justice Hughes would be
nominated and elected, and I still
think so. We have, I understand,
within flfty-eight votes of a majority
guaranteed on the second ballot."
The governor said he knew nothing
of reports that the justice would decline
to run if a third ticket were put
into the field.
Opposition Well Known.
OYSTER BAY, N. Y., June 7.?While
Col. Roosevelt refrains from making
any public statement officially disclosing
his real attitude toward the political
situation in Chicago, it is well
known to his intimates here that he
is opposed to the nomination of Justice
Hughes, and it is their confident belief
that if Justice Hughes is nominated
Col. Roosevelt will himself become a
candidate.
Col. Roosevelt denied positively that
he had telephoned to progressive leaders
at Chicago authorizing thern to
nominate him lor the presidency at the
convention ot that party it the republicans
noininateu Justice Hughes.
Denies Sending Message.
"I haven't sent any such message at
ail," Col. Roosevelt declared em
phatically.
He said he had nothing whatever to
say in regard to the political situation.
While the nature of the telephone
conversations is not allowed to transpire,
Col. House veil s followers here assert
that reports from his lieutenants

Col. itoosevelt, it is well undei stood,
is not at all satisfied with Justice
Hughes' so-called 'Hag speech,' which
he is said to regard as merely a Fourth
of July address, having no value as
disclosing the Justice's attitude toward
the real issues of the day. In the words
of his followers here, the colonel regards
the speech as lurther "evidence
oi pussy footing,'' to which attitude he
is opposed in tne present crisis in the
country'* affairs.
Col. itoosevelt, it is known, feels better
today in regard to his own chances
toward oeing nominated than at any
other time. His followers look for a
oroadsiue from him within a day or
two which they say will be calculated
to eliminate Justice Hughes and any
other canuidale whom tne colonel regards
as representing tne "pussy foot

CHICAGO, June 7, IOI?.
After effecting Itn organization,
the convention adjourned at 1:1!5
p.m. until 11 a.m. tomorrow.
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
HALL, Chicago, June 7.
?Chairman Hilles called the republican
national convention to
order at 11:28 a.m.
The hall was still as Chairman
Hilles spoke, saying a quorum
was present and the convention
would be in order.
"Paraphrasing a remark made
by the late President Mckinley,"
said Mr. Hilles, "this is a year?
whatever may have been true _
of past years?when politics is ~
patriotism and patriotism is poli
tics. Therefore, the audience will
please rise and sing two verses of
'America.'
Delegates Join in Singing.
A male quartet led the singing. The
voices of the delegates swelled through
the bid hall in a mighty chorus, almost
drowning the band.
There was a moment of confusion and the
delegates took their seats and then
the Rev. John Timothy Stone of Chicago,
a Presyterian minister, offered
prayer.
At the end of the prayer the convention
was asked to rise and be photographed.
The flashlight went off with a boom and
the delegates looked good natured.
The next proceeding was the reading of
the call for the convention. Secretary
Reynolds was applauded as he stepped
forward.
The hum of conversation swept over
the hall again as Mr. Reynolds read, j
The call has been published; its reading
was a formality and no one was
much interested in hearing it. As he m
read on, the talk on the floor grew and
his voice was not heard for more than V
the first row of seats; It took six
minutes to read the call. Applause
greeted its end.
Harding Is Presented.
When Secretary Reynolds had fin
isnea reaaing tnairman nines pre- jj
sented Senator Harding, the temporary
chairmah, to make the keynote speech, pi
The first loud applause and cheers of
the convention greeted Senator Harding.
Mr. Murray Crane of Massachusetts, ^
Senator Borah of Idaho and W. B. McKinley
of Illinois were selected to P<
escort Mr. Harding to the platform.
Applause greeted the mention of all VJ
the names as Chairman Hilles announced
them.
Prolonged applause and cheers greeted
Senator Harding as he mounted the qi
platform. Chairman Hilles presented
i him in a few words. Mr. Harding ?
bowed and smiled, and plunged into
' his prepared speech, reading from t
j manuscript. tr
Chairman Hilles left the chair tem1
porarily, and many of the leaders took W
the opportunity to confer while Senator
Harding was speaking.
Cheers at Telling Points.
Applause punctuated Senator Harding's*
speech from time to time, and,
while there were some demonstrations,
on the whole the convention listened ir
quietly as he read. There were cheers ?
when he declared the country was calling
for republican administration and a|
when he asked all to forget the inharmonious
convention of four years ago.
His reference to the need of preparedness
for national defense was greeted
with a roar of applause. More applause
greeted his declaration that "this is not
the time for recrimination, it is a day
of reconsecration."
"I know the republican party to be
genuinely progressive as well as effect- rjive,"
he declared.
When he reached a mention of Abra- ?
ham Lincoln there was another brief
demonstration.
As Senator Harding spoke he held his
prepared address in his hand, but seldom
referred to it. He followed the P
with hardly the skin of a wnrrf Vii? .
full voice carrying to the farthest ends 1C
of the Coliseum.
Taking up national defense, Senator pi
Harding brought applause when he declared
that there "is a call today for ei
prudent, patriotic and ample Individual
defense."
There was a shout and long handclapping
when the speaker said the republicans
"believe sincerely and soberly in
1 adequate national defense."

CONVENTION HALL, Chicago, June 7.?
i his keynote speech today as temporary chairlan
of the republican national convention, Senator
/arren G. Harding of Ohio, said:
"It is good to greet this representative body
i that American republicanism on which is centred
the high hopes of the republic. I can beeve?nay,
I know?that a vast majority of the
eople of our United States is expecting the party
tonsors here assembled to write anew the sacred
wenant of republicanism, and reconsecrate the
irty to the nation's service and the people's adincement.
That same majority expects you to
dect a standard-bearer who shall not only typify
jr expression of faith,-but shall so enlist the condence
and trust of our American citizenship that
le work of this convention will be confirmed over
helminglv at the ballot box next November.
"The country, wearied afresh by a disappointig
and distressing democratic administration, is
tiling for republican relief, and there is every
ispiration, every encouragement, every confience
that the light of republican conscience, set
flame in this convention, will illumine tne way
> the country's restoration.
LET US FORGET 1912.
"We did not do very well in making for harlony
the last time we met. The country has reretted,
let us forget?and make amends to our
Duntry. We did not divide over fundamental
rinciples, we did not disagree over a national pol:y.
We split over methods of party procedure and
referred personalities. Let us forget the differlces,
and find new inspiration and new compenition
in a united endeavor to restore the country.
"The essential principles of republicanism are
nchanged and unchanging; the lofty intent, the
[destructible soul and the undying spirit of reablicanism
are as dominant today as in the desned
beginning sixty years ago, or at any time
aring the intervening years, and they are enisle

interest is self-asserting, and 'paramounting' h;
its perils, as the democratic party will bear wi

must come from this convention, made up t
delegates who believe in popular, representativ
