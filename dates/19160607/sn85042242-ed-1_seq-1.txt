"Patrol vessels and destroyers at
once proceeded to the spot and a par­
ty was sent along the coast to search,
but oqly some bodies and a capsized
boat has. been found up to the pres­
ent.
"As the whole shore has been
searched front the seaward, I greatly
fear, that there is little hope of find­
ing any survivors.
.No iReports 'Received.
"!N6 reports have yet been received
from the search party on shore.

Blow to England.
The news that Earl Kitchener and
his staff, who were proceeding to Rus­

lost off the Orkney Islands last night

found regret of the disaster whereby
the secretary of state for war has lost
his life while proceeding on a special
mission to the emperor of Russia.
"Field Marshal Lord Kitchener
gave .48 years of distinguished serv­

to his administrative genius and un­
wearying energy that the country liasf
been able to create the place in the
field the army which today is uphold­

ed by the army as a great soldier,
who under conditions of unexampled
difficulties rendered supreme and de­
voted service to the army and state.
"His Majesty, the King, commands
that the officers of the army shall
wear mourning with their

FAILURE OF DRIVE
BROUGHT CRITICISM
London. June 6.—Of several things
that entitled Earl Kitchener to a place
in world history, the most notable is
that he organized the largest volun­
teer army the world h^s ever seen, in
the greatest war of all times.
Within a year from the sudden out­
break of the European war in August,
1914, the ranks of British fighting men
were quadrupled by an increase from
less than one million to nearly 4,000,
000.
All other Great Powers that entered
the war had huge standing armies and
compulsory military service. Great
Britain alone faced the issue with con-

railroad builder and financier, who

The three sons of Mr. Hill, the six
daughters, and the widow, Mrs. Mary
M. Hill, all signed the petition, which
states that Mr. Hill left no will, and
places the value of the estate at $i0,

mality as the true value will not be
known until the administrator has
made a complete examination.
he heirs, it was announced, desire
to keep the estate intact, and this
probably will be done by the adminis­
trator rather than through a trust

London, June 6.—From the Pripet
river southward to the 'Roumanian
frontier, the Russians, according to
Petrograd, are continuing to devel6p
successes against the Germans anil
Austrians. In fights along this front
of some 2"»0 miles, the Russians al­
ready have made prisoners of 480 of­
ficers and more than 25,000 men, and
captured 27 guns and more than 50
machine guns.

In this offensive, which is declared
to be a carefully co-ordinated move­
ment, the Russians are said to have
a plentiful supply of ammunition and
men, and with roads now in good con­
dition, their maneuvers are cxpccti*!
to develop swiftly. The number of
the Teutonic allies facing the 'Rus­
sians is reported to amount to about
GOO,000 men.

The Turks in Asia Minor, near Ba.il

been made by the Russians against
the Turks in the vicinity of Khanikan

Attorneys expressed hopes that a

Probate Judge Edmund W. Bazille
set July 3 as the date for the hearing
on the petition. Any persons opposed
to the appointment of Mr. Hill must
appear on that day and show cause
why letters of administration should
not be granted.
Leading railroad officials and finan­
ciers here were not surprised at the
action taken by the heirs, as it had
been rumored that Mr. Hill had left
no will, and that Louis W. 'Hill prob­
ably would take charge of the vast
holdings.
The estate of Mr.Hill had been var­
iously estimated at from $150,000,000
to $250,000,000.
Louis W. Hill announced that he
would carry out his father's policies,
"to the letter."

No Enthusiasm.
There never has been a convention,
for which so little had been arranged.
They plunge into their work tomor­

them in the inner councils of the lead*

Hushes leaders, remaining confi­
dent in their predictions that the jus­
tice will be nominated on an early
ballot, were lifting up their forces to­
night, surveying the effect of the
drive upon them by allied favorite
sons and recruitiiig delegates from
the latest arrivals.
Silent On Hughes.
Progressive leaders, unwilling to
say, if they could, whether the colonel
would support Justice Hughes to
carry on their fight for Mr. Roose­
velt as their first choice. Today
George B. Cortelyou, former member
of the Roosevelt cabinet, arrived hera
and joined William Loeb, Jr., and
Geo. Von L. Meyer, both former mem­
bers of the colonel's official family, to
comprise Roosevelt's steering com*
mittee within the Republican conven*
tion.
