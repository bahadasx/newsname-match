Indications Are Now That

CHICAGO, June 6. The Republi
can timl the progressive national
conventions both assemble tomorrow
without any Indication that the lend
ers have found the common ground
on which they had hoped to estab
lish unity. Three days of almost
constant conferences have failed to
bring the Republicans nd the Pro
gressives to an agreement on a man
for the nicsidential nomination. A
linlf dozen names, any one of which is
acceptable to tho Republicans, have
been rejected by the Progressives,
who have proposed no one but Colo
nel Roosevelt.
Not Nincc the party was born has
there been such a lack of cohesive
leadeiship mining the Republicans
and the oldest convention observe! a
declare they never have seen such a
general lack of enthusiasm. There
never has been a convention for which
so little had been arranged before
hand. They plunge Into their work
tomorrow with practically everything
undone which hitherto has been done
for them ill the Inner councils of
the leaders.
Hughes leaders, confident the Jus
tice would be nominated on an early
ballot, were lining up their forces to
night surveying the effect of the drive
upon them by tho allied "f.ivurite
sons" and recruiting unpledged dele
gates from among the latest nrrivals.
Want Teddy Only.
Progressive leaders, unwilling to
say, even If they could, whether
Ciilonel Roosevelt would support

FIRE FIEND LESS

Sprriiil to Tin- World.
OKLAHOMA CITY, June 6. The
fire loss for the stale is about $100,
000 less for the month of May thai.
It was for the month of April, accord
ing to the report issued today by C. C.
Hammonds, state fire marshal, the
loss for the state for .Mav being $1'U,
5!t. There were 0ii fires during tru.
month. Three persons were burnen
to death during the month and sev
eral severely Injured.
The state fire marshal believes that
undue carelessness prevents investi
gation as to the cause of fires and
ihls accounts for the reason that so
many are reported with cuuse un
known. ."The fire waste of our state
has always been excessive and the
only Just reason that can be given for
the large fire waste is that the partle
reporting the fires fail to give any
attention to the Investigation of the
fire reported and endeavor to find out
what the cause of the fire was. The
fire chiefs and sheriffs find It much
easier to write the word 'unknown'
than to Investigate for a cause."

SAN ANTONIO, Texas. June 6.
General Kunslon announced latv.
today that he had what uppeared to
be positive information that Luis
Ie La Rosa was marching from a
point south of Iaredo In the directloi
of the border with the evident Inten
tion of raiding the country somewhere
west of Rio Granite city. There are
not now in that district enough Amer
ican troops to prevent !e LuKosa and
his men from crossing.
Gen. William A. Mann, con mand
ing the Ameiloan forces in that dis
trict with headquarters at Laredo,
has reported to General Kunston that
he Is taking such measures as puss,
hie to strengthen the patrol toward
the cast and to guard Laredo.
To the cast of Laredo in Zapata
countv across whose southern bound
ary I e IiRnsa is expected to move,
the American strength Is only one
troop of cavalry.
At just what point on the border
line the Mexicans intend to strike was
not learned and it was not announced

If He La Rosa and his men rcacr.
the Rio Grande before American
troops can head them off, enoligii
force will be sent against them to
drive them bark into Mexico, and it
was intimated, to run them clown on
Mexican soil..
He J.uKosa was one of the leaders
of the group that directed the raids
west of Rrownsvilln a year ago. Since
then he has been a fugitive in his
own country with a price of ll.ouO on
his head offered by the slate of Tcjcir.
The Information thM reached Gen
eral Kunston indicated that De La-
Rosa would not be more than two oi
thne days at the most In getting to
the border. If raiders strike Amen
can territory in Zapata county little
injury to the residents is anticipated
because with the exception of one or
two families all are Mexicans. From
the farmers a large number of horses
and mules could be secured, how
ever.

SUMMER SCHOOL
BEGINS MONDAY
Si Wwk's f'ourso to Ik' Offered for
Students In Klcnicntary
Schools.
In order to provide a means by
which pupils may make up portions
of their regular school work, a sum
mer school, under direction of the
Tulsa public school system, will be
gin classes Monday, June 12. The
school will be only for elementary
students, the demand not being great
enough among high school pupils to
warrant offering the course.
The school will be held In the high
school building and will hold classes
six days a week. The classes will
begin at 8:3d o'clock In the morning
and last until 12:30 o'clock, the aft
ernoon being avoided on account of
the warm weather. The school will
last six weeks. A tuition will be
charged.
Miss Kate Moran and Miss I .a lira
Gregory have been retained as teach
ers for the school and others will
be added if the enrollment Justifies
such addition.
The school Is designed especially
for pupils who have failed to pass
some of their subjects In the regular
public schools and wish to make the
work up during the summer. Pupils
will be admitted only on recommen
dation of the principal of their
school. Work taken in the summer
school will count as a semester's
work in the regular system.

PKTROGRAD. June 6 (via London,
7:24 p. m. The Russians con
tinue to develop the su"cesses won
by their newly inaugurated offensive.
It is reported that up to the present
time they have captured 40 officers,
25,000 men, 17 cannon and lfi machine
guns.
The sudden blow struck by the
Russians along the entire Galician
front of 275 miles, from the I'ripet to
Rumania, is, in the unanimous opin
ion of the military critics here, a
brilliant beginning of the long-
awaited Russian offensive. The con
dition of the roads now is perfect,
and with a plentiful supply of am
munition, (he Russian advance is ex
pected to develop swiftly.
s Co-Ordinalcd Attack.
The movement derives significance
from the fact that it is nol an iso
lated attack against any one portion
of the Austrian lines, but a carefully
co-ordinated movement, cinttrucing
the whole front. The movement is
under the active leadeship of Gen
cal Rrussiloff, who conducted the
brilliant campaign in the Carpathians
in !!H4. The forces opposing the
Russian advance are estimated at
forty Austrian Infantry divisions and
from tea to 15 Austrian cavalry di
visions assisted by tit the most two
divisions of Germans. This brings the
toinl Teutonic forces operating oil
This front up to six hundred thou
sand men.
Tho Initiative belongs entirely to
the Russians, and tho Austrians, evi
dently taken by surprise, fell back
without being able to start a coun
ter offensive.
Is Most Important.
Aside from Its military and strategic
importance for this froni, the Russian
nicvcrnent undoubtedly will have a
powerful effect upon the military sit
uation elsewhere, decreasing Austrian
piessiire on the Italian front from
the necessity of bringing reinforce
ments to this theater, while it also
is rxpecled to influence the situation
in the Ralknns.
The Turks in Asia Minor near Rai
bnrt and Frzingan again have at
tempted an offensive against lite Rus
sians, but I'eirogr.ot says their efforts
failed. A successful raid has been
made by the Rusiiuiis against the
Turks in the vicinity of Khanikin,
near the Persian border northeast of

tho Teutonic allies has been begun
by the Russians.
So far as has been ascertained
thero were no survivors of the dis
:ister and it seems probable that be
tween two hunderd and threo hun
dred men met their death when the
Hampshire, either struck u mine or
was torpedoed.
From the i'ripet river southward
to tho Rumanian frontier the Rus
sians, according to PetrogT.id, are
continuing to develop successes
against the Germans and Austrians.
In tho fights along this front of
some 2.".0 miles the Russians already
have made prisoners of 4 SO officers
and more than twenty-five thousand
men and caslured 20 guns and more
than fifty machino guns. This of
fensive Is declared to be a carefully
co-ordinated movement and tho Rus
sians aro said to have a plentiful
supply of ammunition and men. With
the roads now in good condition their
maneuvers aro expected to develop
swiftly. Tho number of tho Teu
tonic illies facing the Russians is
reported to amount to about six
hundred thousand, men.
Since tho repulse of two German
infantry attacks between Fort Vaux
land Damloup Monday night the
fighting in the Verdun region has
again developed into artillery duels
with the Fort Vaux-Damloup sector
the center of the greatest violence.
No material guins for either side arc
reported.
The Austrians still aro being held
from further advances and with
heavy losses by tho Italians, accord
ing to Home. In the Vablnrsa and
Pasubio sectors, and on tho front be
tween the Poslna and Astico rivers
vicious Austrian attacks have been
put down and the Italians have
gained some ground against the Aus
trians on the western slopes of Monte
Cenglo.
