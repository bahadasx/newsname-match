Sunday Excursions
We do not believe the people of Ver
mont, especially this section, are in
favor of Sunday railroad excursions.
That of last Sunday to Plattsbnrg via
the St. I. & L. C and B. & L. railroad
was a disgrace to the state. A drunken
fight, in which at least one person was
badly pounded and several others pum
melled made a disgraceful sight for ex
cursionists to witness. If we must have
these Sunday trips, let the railroads take
along special police to preserve order
and forbid the promiscuous casainir
a
around of the bottle.

Band Concert Series Begins
inenrsc Dana concert ot tne season
was held in Academy Park last Thnrs
day evening and was largely attended,
although the attendance from outside
was not as large as usual, as it had not
been previously announced. The num
bers given at the initial appearance were
especially good, and shows much work
by Mr. Sanders and the members.
It has frequently been remarked in the
past that " Morrisville has one of the
best bands In northern Vermont," and
the present organization bids fair to
keep good the reputation of the old
timers and possibly establish a new
record. Considering the fact that the
members are nearly all young musicians
their progress is quite remarkable, and
reflects much credit upon the ability of
Mr. Sanders.
Wins Honors at Middlebury
The many friends of Alban J. Parker,
son ot Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Parker of
Morrisville, will be pleased to know that
the faculty ot Middlebury College has
designated him as valedictorian of the
class of 1916. Miss Ada Barnes of Mid
dlebury has been designated as salutato-
rian. The grades up to the middle of
this last semester determined the final
standing of the class in the selection of
these two positions of honor. Mr.
Parker has been active in athletics while
in college, winning his letter in football
He also played on his class basketball
team during his four years at college.
He is a member of the Glee club, as well
as the manager of the successful club rep
resenting Middlebury this last season.

Record-Breaking Hail Storm
One of the most severe rain and bail
storms that has visited this section in
years, struck Morrisville Tuesday after
noon. For nearly an hour and a half,
the rain and hail came down in torrents.
Slight damage was done to the lightning
conductors at the electric light station
and the power was turned off for about
two hours. Repairs were made, bow
ever, in time to give the usual lighting
service.
The hail storm was the most severe in
a small locality on West Hill, near the
No. 15 school, where the ground was
white with hail stones, as large as lemon
drops. At the O. W. Wrisley farm, a
fifty-pound tub was filled alter the storm
and seventeen hours later a peck meas
ure was filled with hail stones that were
found behind the barn.
