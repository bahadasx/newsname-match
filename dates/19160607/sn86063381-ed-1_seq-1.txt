jgF'ISt "S^BJ'B?
Have Big Parade.
CMcago, June 7.To urge an equal
suffrage plank in the Republican
platform, forty thousand women, two
elephants and a goat marched down
Michigan avenue to the Coliseum,
where the Gra~nd Old Party meets to
day. The rain did not stop the par
ade.
From every voting unit in the
United States women got in line and
urged the suffrage plank.
Two classes of women marched, the
"free" women, those who already
have the vote, and the women from
the states where equal suffrage has
not yet been granted.
At the head of the grand proces
sion Miss Portie Willis, pretty New
York suffragist, drove two huge ele
phants. The elephants carried a
heavy plank with the word "Suff
rage" painted large upon it.
12 Free States.
A distinction was made in the par
ade between the twelve "free" states
(the eleven with full suffrage and
Illinois with municipal and presiden
tial suffrage) and the 36 states
which have not yet granted equal
voting privileges to women.
Twelve pretty girls bearing the
names of the twelve "free" states
were dressed in white. These were
followed by thirty-six girls dressed
in a more sombre hue and bearing the
names of the thirty-six states with
out effual suffrage.
It had been suggested that the
thirty-six grey-clad women wear
manacles on their hands and imita
tion balls and chains on their ankles,
but this was voted down as not truly
representative of conditions.
The parade is given under the aus
pices of the National American Wo
man Suffrage association.
Goat'a Mascot.
Six hundred women school teachers
marched. They had as their mascot
a goat.
"We have so often been the goat,"
said one of the schoolmarms, "that a
goat is the most appropriate emblem
we can find."
This gave the parade the appear
ance of a zoo, taken with the ele
phants. All the teachers are mem

Big Crowd Present at Opening of Conventions Rain Fails to Prevent
Activities Women Hold Big Suffrage Parade
in Chicago Today.
KEYNOTE ADDRESSES ARE GIVE N ASK
FOR UNIO N OF PARTIES AND PATRIOTISM
Chicago, June 7.The Republicans met today with as much knowl-
edge as to whom they would choose as Noah had about the probable
duration of the deluge. The similie is especially fitting on account of
the rain today. The sessions today were simply a transfer of talk from
the hotel lobbies to the convention hall. Temporary Chairman Harding
gave his keynote address, the temporary roll call of delegates was re-
ceived and accepted, convention comittees were announced and an ad-
journment was taken for more talk.
Ready for Peace.
The Progressive convention opened ready for war or peace at its
own terms with the G. O. P. Fire works ega the instant the
name of Roosevelt was mentioned. Perkins is hopeful for an amalgama-
tion. He plans to block a premature nomination of Roosevelt. The
radicals are determined to nominate Roosevelt and plan to block any
move toward a permanent compromise.
To Check Move.
Milton Purdy, Minnesota Progressive national committeeman, follow-
ing Minnesota's caucus last night told Progressive leaders that the Min-
nesotans would help hold the Progressives in check, until Saturday in at-
tempting to see what the Republicans did.
Bookmakers today are betting even money on T. R.
Senator Harding in his keynote speech made an appeal for Amer-
icanism and party union. He stated that the G. O. P. wanted harmony.
A contingent of Shermanites attempted to enter a Roosevelt meeting
this morning There was a fist fight and one face and two Roosevelt
banners were damaged.
Wild Demonstrations.
The Republican convention convened at 11:45 and the Progressive
at 12:27. After Chairman Harding had talked one hour and twenty min-
utes the Republicans adjourned until 11 o'clock tomorrow.
The Progressives went wild 3 5 minutes after convention in a dem-
onstration for Roosevelt. Chairman Robbins in his address stated that
Teddy was the greatest and bravest American and that the nation was
clamoring for him. Then the Progressives tore up the hall in a viol-
ent demonstration. The demonstration was still booming at 2:30 this
afternoon.

FORTY GENTS PIE MONTH
(By Perry Arnold.)
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Chicago, June 7:Jostling crowds
on Michigan Boulevard, the blare of
packed humanity in hotel lobbies,
beribboned and be-badged visitors,
and the buzz, buzz of talkthis was
the opening day of tfce_ Republican
and Progressive National Conven
tions.
At least, these were the outward
manifestations of the chosen few of
two national parties meeting in sel
emn conclave to name a presidential
ticket.
A Steam Roller
Four years ago the steam roller
staked its Gargantuan, way through
Chicago's streets, down and through
the Colliseum and back into the
roundhouse of political history.
If the steam roller hadn't per
formed, there would have been only
one national convention today. But
pancake-making wheels of the jug
gerant arose, brushed off their
garments and assuaged their mangled
bodies with the balm of a convention,
candidates and machinery of their
very own.
It appeared today that the bruises
the steam-roller of four years ago
inflicted might be entirely healed.
The Republican man in the street and
the Progressive man in the street
hailed each other as brother, not as
political enemy.
Feeling of Cariosity
Gone today was the before-the
battle acrimony of four years ago
which centered about the smallest
minute of the convention machinery.
Maybe the leaders of the Pro
gressive and Republican gatherings
still maintain an air of aloofness
mixed with a curiosity as to what the
other side was doing, but there wasn't
nearly so much grim desperation in
the chase of the Southern delegate,
the pursuit of the elusive unpledged
delegate or in the jockeying for
places on the permanent roll of the
convention roster.
The business scheduled in both
national gatherings is to be more or
less perfunctory today. Calling to
order, prayer, introductory speeches
by the national chairman and the set
ting to work of the convention com
mittees is about all either the
Republican or the Progressive leaders
expect to accomplish in the day's
public sessions.
The real fireworks is expected to
begin tomorrow with the keynote
speeches of the temporary chairmen.
Tonight the Resolutions Commit
tees are expected to begin their long
grind of hearings and closed sessions,
leading up to the formation of plat
forms.
Gavel at Noon
It was National Chairman Charles
D. Hughes whose gavel banged to
order the Republican conclave, at
noon precisely. Hours before that
minute the great galleries of the
Colliseum had been qacked to their
utmost capacity.
A band, tucked far up above in a
