trust of our American citizenship that

iiin June skies are today smiling
uon upon Milton and contributing a
i olden portion to the success of the
annual .strawberry Festival and Horse

is offering her luscious sweetness to

rapidly and have the flavor for which
they are famous in this country. All

Despite the counter attraction of

huge crowd In Milton for the annual
leatlvitles. The Walla Walla valley
has sent in many hundreds while Pan

I'tunltica are well represented.
The horse feature of the show Is

The Judging will commence, this aft

have been made.
The chief entertainment feature of
