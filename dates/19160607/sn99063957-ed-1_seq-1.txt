(t'niti'd Press staff correspondent.)
Auditorium, Chicago, June 7. The
progressive national convention went
wild 35 minutes after it assembled to
tiny ut the first iiiention of Theodore
.oos.'elt 'a name from the piitt'orm.
Tho ccii-gutes f'u-eied, yel.'ed, shout
i l, jumped hi) in the air and -waved
banners and everything else they could
find, when Temporary Chairman Hobins
ramed Roosevelt as tho "greatest rend
er of his time, " one minute after he
had Htarted speaking.
'The natioi) is clamoring for one
man Roosevelt," Robins 'declared in
li is keynofe speech.
Robins named the colonel as the
"bravest and wisest leader o'f the peo
ple in our time, the foremost private
citizen of the world."
"We have listened for mouths to the
wrangling voices of the selfish, nar
row groups,' said Robins. "What wo
vant is the nations favorite son, not
the favorite son of any state."
Declaring "that we should speak
plainly to our brothers in spirit, espe
cially in the republican-.piittv,!'. Rob
ins asked for unity on Americanism
nd warned "those of an easy and ac
commodating political virtue that will
v it surrender a principle. "
Demonstration Began.
Then the Roosevelt demonstration be
gan, the delegates seizing a big banner
-and carrying it to the stage.
Pennsylvania followed, with Califor
nia, North Dakota, Texas and Colorado
falling into line. ,
Within a minute practically all the
ntnte delegation standards were planted
in a cluster about the speaker's stand.
As the demonstration proceeded, the
riotous mob of cheering delegates
crushed so closely nbout Robins and
Murdock that the two were completely
iost from sight.
Drums beat, "moose horns" tooted
and everybody yelled in a bedlam of
sound. They were all primed and ready
for the start after days of waiting.
The entire crowd sang "We Want
Teddy" until the arches of the audi
torium nearly cracked under the vol
ume of sound. Finally thoy got tired of
singing it nud yelled it.
The band played all the patriotic
songs it knew, and started to repeat
them.
Robins let the crowd have its head
and made no attempt to cheek the dem
onst ration.
As dozens of delegates inarched in
single file in front of the speaker's
stand, Perkins climbed on a table above
the crowd and held an impromptu re
eeption, shaking hnnds with the pass
ing delegates and beating time to the
music.
Red Headed Delegate It.
At 1:25 p. m. when the demonstra
tion had been on for 2.1 minutes and
was apparently (lying down, the band

Chicago, June 7. "Americanism"
wag the keynote and party unity the
appeal of .Senator Warren G. Harding's
speech, formally opening the republi
can national convention today. The
vast majority of the people, Harding
said, expected the party sponsors "to
write anew the sacred covenant of re
publication and re-consecrate the party
to tho nation's service."
"We. did not very well in making
for harmony the lust time we met."
the temporary chairman said in open
ing his address. "The country has re
gretted; let us forget and make
amends to our country. We did not di
vide over f unilnmental principles; we
did not disagree over a national policy.
We split over methods of party proced-'
ure arid preferred personalities.
"The allied hosts of the believers
in republican principles are in n vast

ners of harmony are unfurled. We have
seen the re-enlistment of those who
believe in republican doctrines. Re
dedicating here and now the republican
party to progress and glory of the. re
public, let us bury party prefixes with
the administration which our differ
ences put into power."
Harding expressed the belief that
there was not a reactionary republican
bearing credentials in the conven-tron
and added "no party can endure which
is not progressive, 'i know the repub
lican party is genuinely progressive and
effective."
He Tlayed Wilson.
After extending the olive branch to
the progressives, in convention at the
Auditorium, Harding outlined the fun
damentals upon which the party plan
ned to re-construct its power. At the
same time, he flayed the Wilson ad
ministration, concluding that "every
thing is abnormal except the depicted
condition of the federal treasury, which
is characteristic of democratic con
trol." and the facility of the adminis
tration for "writing varied notes with
out effective notice," and speaking
"with more rhetoric than resolution
"Bleeding Kurope," he said, "is a
warning 'for prudent, patriotic and
ample national defense. Let him who
is anxious about the cost remember that
republican policies afford the ample
means without burdens upon the people.
"We proclaim justice and we love
peace and wo menn to have them even
if we have to fight for them."

Some Little Stories From
Chicago's Big Conventions
Chicago, June 7. Willium Alden
Smith, of Michigan, says the real con- .
test here is not over the presidential I
uominatiou nt all.
"Wo must name a man who can lead
us to a clenn majority in tho senate," j
said Smith today, "and that menus we
must carry Missouri. A republican
president with the present senate might
juBt as well sit down and twiddlo his
thumbs four vears."
Indiana, Maine, Nevada, Missouri
and Nebraska are tho states Smith says
must elect republican senators.
No Harmony There.
Chicago, June 7. A contingent of
Sherman enthusists mixed with a dele
gation of Roosevelt rooters early today
and in the amicable exchange of fists,
one face and two Roosevelt banners
were badly damaged.
The clash occurred when Shormanites
endeavored to break up a Roosevelt
hurrah inciting. City detectives assist

The Stampede Stunt.
Chicago, June 7. The "gallery queen
in red" will be on the job for T. it. at
the 0. 0. P. convention today, with n
more spectacular stunt thnn that with
which she stirred up the 1!U2 conven
tion. "I'll do something that will create
more of a furore than jumping on the
platform in u red satin dress and wav
ing "Teddy's" picture and a red para
sol," declared Mis. William A. Davis,
"the queen" today. "Maybe I'll ar
range to have u monster American flag
with 'Teddy's' picture in the center

of the Coliseum ceiling."

Several of tho snap shot artists
focused through the fog and gloom and
brought back to their city editors pic

While Longworth wns walking along

Coliseum, Chicago, June 7. Under
the handicap of a drab, dull day, with
a rnin-sonked assemblage, the republi
nra national 'eonTention got under way
today. The weather was plainly ou the
nerves of tho delegates who quieted
down at 11:2S when Chairman Hilda'
gavel fell 23 minutes after tho time
sot.
It was not until Temporary Chairman
Hurding had gotten well along in his
keynote speech that tho air really
warmed up. The Ohioan, reputed to be
one of tho handsomest men in the Uni
ted .States senate ami a polished speak
er, drew tho 'first old-fashioned hall
rocking spontaneous applause, when,
having warmed up himself and warm
ed his rain-soaked audience, he pleaded
for a navy, "that fears none in the
world," applause that lasted through a
minuto of frenzied cheers greeted his
declaration that the United States
should "not be too proud to fight."
Hurding greeted an audience that
was wet and cold, freezing with ap
proaching colds and uncomfortable in
I ho musty atmosphere of the great
hall. He got merely a polite reception
at first, but as his polished phrases
sank into tho audience, he gradually
warmed the air.
The 15,000 began to forget their snif
fles, their cold feet nnd wet clothes.
Tho republicans convened without,
any sort of agreement on the candi
dates whom they will select. It was
still Hughes and Roosevelt and Burton
and Fairbanks, and all the rest with
nobody knowing exactly what would
happen. There was no doubt, that the
G. O. P. convention was slightly in
terested in what was happening and
nbout to happen at the auditorium,
where those who broke the bonds four
years ago were holding conference.
That thero would be nu attempt frr
u "get together" meeting of commit
tees of both conventions whb certain.
At least one resolution wns to be intro
duced, suggesting a combination of in
terests. This was the one offered by
tho New Jersey delegation, asking that
a committee be appointed to advise the
progressives as to the republicans'
plans for a platform.
This Js the scheme advanced by Kd
ward C. Hreannn of Jersey City.
Borah and Hughes Dominate.
Chicago, June 7. Unless a majority
of tho resolutions committee turns
down the resolutions of Senators Bornh
and Lodge, who are expected to be its
dominating figures, the republican plat
form will include a flat declaration for
universal military training. The feas
ibility of this isue wns discussed in
conferences among leaders todny. Lead
ers found they would have more support
for it thnn hnd seemed likely. Delegates
representing fnvorite sons are expect
ed to furnish the principal opposition.
The wholo platform will be built
around tho word Americanism, nnd in
content and context will be designed to
catch tho npprovnl of Colonel Roose
velt. Aside from the preparedness isue,
the lending planks will be protection of
American rights abroad, woman suf
frage nnd a protective tariff.
Though the platform is to be formed
theoretically only after a public, henring
lute this afternoon nnd evening, the
foregoing cardinal points have been
agreed upon in meetings among lend
ers and drafts have been prepared.

Progressive Platform.
Chicago, June 7. Kvery prepared
ness and "Americanism" plank that
Colonel Roosevelt has espoused in the
jast year is to bo included, along with,
woman suffrage and lubor reform
planks, in the platform of the progres
sive party.
William Allen White, member of pro
gressive resolutions c ommittec, from
Kansas', and Dean Walter Lewis, of the
department of law, University of Penn
sylvania, have completed a preliminary
draft of tho platform, largely under
Colonel Roosevelt's direction.
Tho platform is understood t iaelude
the following planks:
Preparedness, including universal ser
vice and a great navy,
Americanism, with emphasis on tin
necessity of a strong foreign policy.
National woman suffrnge. Improve
ment of lubor conditions through en
forcement of u strict child lubor law.
Further extension of tho initiative
and referendum.
Advocacy of more liberal changes in
the national constitution.
Tariff commission, or some other
means of regulating tho tariff with ex

larged merchant marine.
Predictions wero made today that all
