EIGHTY FOUR
RED MEN
Of Cheyenne River Reservation As
sume the Duties of Amer
ican Citizenship
The following account of the
ceremonies connected with the de
livery of Patents in fee simple to
the eighty-four new-made Indian
citizens of the United States we
adopt from the Outlook magazine
of Ma}* 24, as it was duplicated at
Eagle Butte, except the presence
of Secretary Lane, the quotation
being an account of the ceremonies
at Yankton Agency. The pro
ceedings at Eatrle Butte were con
ducted by Major McLaughlin as
sisted by Sup't F. C. Campbell.
Following the account are the
names of the eighty four allottees
of Chey. River reservation who
have been elected as American cit
izens.
From here Major McLaughlin
went to the Standing Rock Agency
where he conducted the same cere
monies for forty allottes of that
reservation.
"Secretary Lane, of the Interior
Department, has long been an ear
nest advocate of the policy of
making Indians citizens just as
fast as they can exercise citizen
ship intelligently. When citizen
ship is bestowed, individual rights
and responsibilities replace tribal
allegiance and wardship to the
government. The transition is a
solemn and important step for the
Indian, and it should be marked
with fitting ceremony. The Am
erican Indian has a natural liking
for symbolism and ceremonial
According!}', the Secretary has de
vised what seems to us a remark
able and impressive ritual, used
the other day when at Yankton,
South Dakota, nearly two hundred
Sioux were made citizens and pre
sented with individual patents to
their allotted lands. The Sioux
themselves, in an invitation to the
Secretary to be present, said:
'Thirty or forty years ago we
were living in wigwams in our
primitive ways, with the idea that
the Government owed us a living,
and therefore we had no thought
of the morrow. But in recent
years there have grown up, super
ceding the wigwam, fine dwelling
houses, and instead of our ponies
being turned out on the prairies to
graze we have fine barns with two
or three work teams each, with
lofts full of hay, cribs of corn,
bins of wheat, coops of geese,
ducks, aud chickens, and where
thirty or forty years ago were
wild prairies now grow beautiful
wavy fields of corn and wheat, the
industry of us Indians. We have
come to know that instead of the
government owing us a living the
world owes us that living, and we
have started out to collect it.'
"In opening the ritual Mr. Lane
declared that the President hac
sent him "to speak a solemn ant
serious word to you, a word tha
means more to yeu than any other
you have ever heard that the
privilege of becoming free Amer
ican citizens was to be "pointec
out by symbol aud by word, so
that no man or woman shall no
know its meaning."
The entire "ritual" is notable
for its sincerity and the charm of
its symbolism. Each chosen In
dian was called out by his "white'
name, and asked to tell his Indian
name. Then he was handed a bow
and arrow and directed to shoot

the arrow. After he di 1 this. the
Secretary said to him, calling him
ty ttis Indian name: "You have
shoffvOur last a
"row. That means
that you are no longer to live the
ife of an Indian. You are from
his day forward to liv'e the life of
-he white mnn. But you may
leep this arrow it will be to you
a symbol of your uohle race and
of the pride you feel that you
come from the first of all Amer
icans." Then railing the Indian
again by his "white" name. Sec
etary Lane said to him. Pake in
your hand this plow."' As the
"ndian took the handle of the plow
he Secretary said: "This act means
that you have chosen to live the
ife of the white man—and the
white man lives by work. Front
.he earth we must all get our liv
ing, and the earth will not yipld
unless man pours upon it the.
sweat of his brow. Only by work
do we gain a right, to the euioy
ment of life." The Indian was then
presented with a leather purse,
a small flag, and a golden col
ored badge bearing the inscription,
"A Citizen of the United States,"
and the Secretary impressively ex
plained what each meant. Tluis
hc purse means "that the money
\rou gain from your labor must be
wisely kept the flag ("the only
flag you ever have had or ever will
haye"), that the Indian must sfive
his hands, head, and heart, to the
doing of all that will make him a
true American citizen. In the
same way the Indian woman is
handed a work-bag and a purse
and told what are the ideals of the
American family and home. The
ceremony is repeated with each
man and woman, and as it con
cludes the audience shouts its
greeting to the new citizen, hail
ins? him by his "white" name.
There are both romance and
common sense in this ceremony.
It is a, tokan of notable advance in
Indian life and of a new and fine
attitude on the part of the gov
ernment toward the first Amer
icans.

"TAe lnjvry oj one i.v the Concern of all."
Perhaps some of our readers
imagined The Press had taken a
pretty big contract, after reading
our article last week about im
proving the old Muddy—-and are
still dreaming to the same effect.
Luckily, The Press has a chance to
come back at 'em a^ain. in the I'ol
lowing account of a little incident,
which we quote from the lvansa
City Star of -May L'-lth.
We only have the time to re
mark in passing, this time, that it
appears to us that llie clipping
shows that the arniv engineers
need a whole lot of volunteers to
aid them in tneir v-ork of improv
ing the old Mudth but the trouble
is, as constituted by the law and
precedence, the ttriuv engineers
dont have anything to do with
flood-control: they were constitut
ed to assist the bright "statesmen"
at the national capital in manag
ing the "pork-barrell"—us far as
the Missouri river i- concerned.
"By placing in upper reaches of
canyons and ravines obstructions
consisting of small, inexpensive
ams of stones and logs, arranged
one above the other like the steps
of a huge stairway, it is hoped to
solve the Hood problem in Cali
fornia.
"Every year thousands of dollars
worth of damage done by water
overflowing the brinks of streams:
but recently a board of California
engineers began work in an ex
perimental way, with the object of
checking the high water by means
of the Swiss system of flood con
trol. They selected a ravine with
steep slopes which had always
given trouble in the past,-and built
across it a series of tiny dams,
only a few feet high. Then from
an artificial reservoir, built espec
ially for the purpose at the head
of the ravine, they released a huge
volume of water in order to sim
ulate conditions following a cloud
burst.
"The wall of water went surging
down the valley, but when it reach
ed the first check dam its velocity
was somewhat impeded. Still, it
continued onward until it reached
the second obstruction, which also
acted as a quietus oo the torrent
ial flow. The process was repeat
ed from one dam to the other, un
til at the bottom of the valley, al
most no flow oc-curd. In other
words, the series of check dams
acted like so many breaks stopping
the onward ru.h of a railway
train. A certain amount of water
is impounded behind each dam
and gradually seeps awav into the
subsoil, without doing any dam
age.
"The results of the cxpeiimcnts
as reported by Engineer Harry F.
Olmsted, are considered to be so
successful that a tig field of use
fulness for the check dam method
of flood control is predicted."
