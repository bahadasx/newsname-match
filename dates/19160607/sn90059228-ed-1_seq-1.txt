HIGH SCHOOL
COMMENCEMENT
EXERCISES
Big Class is Graduated from Warren
High School.Masterly Ad
dress by Pres. Vincent.
Another successful year of the
Warren High School was brought to
an auspicious close last week with
interesting programs, the climax be
ing the commencement address by
President George E. Vincent, of the
University of Minnesota.
Class Day Exercises.
On Thursday evening the Class
Day Exercises were held, these ex
ercises being more interesting than
usual from the fact the several new
features were introduced.
Each number on the program was
well rendered. The salutatory by
Margaret Dundas, was a pleasing
effort. The Class History by Gundy
Lodoen was well written and related
the principal events in the history of
the class. The Class Prophecy was
cleverly told by Ruth Wood and
Anna Johnson. As the future of
each student was related, he or sheattend
appeared at an opening in the cur
tain engaged in the future occupa
tion or role foretold by the fair
fortune tellers. The Class Reading
by Earl Johnston was well done.
Anna Skog and Agnes Magnuson
presented the "Class Herbarium," in
which for each student was ascribed
some characteristic flower. The
presentation of small gifts, appro
W priate and otherwise, to members of
Sthe class by Minnie Parr and Emma
Johnson was an amusing feature.
The Class Poem was composed and
read by Agnes Hanson. In it the
deeds of the doughty class of 1916
were cleverly told in rhyme. Gladys
Lincoln and Freda Johnson read the
class will, a humorous document
drawn up in due legal form. The
valedictory by Edwin Johnson was
touched in choice language and de
livered in a pleasing manner. The
songs and instrumental music ren-
-*derc^ on this occasion by the clase
or individual members thereof, was
also very meritorious. The exercises
proved that the class of 1916 is a
talented one and we feel certain
that many of the members will be
heard from in the future as they
climb the ladder of fame.
Commencement.
A large and enthusiastic audience
listened to the commencement ad
dress by President Vincent, of the
University of Minnesota, on Friday
evening. The first number on the
program was music by the High
School Chorus followed by an im
pressive invocation by Rev. L. W.
Barthalow.
The address by President Vincent,
was, like all efforts of this scholarly
and eloquent gentleman, a master
piece in thought and diction. His
subject was "Playing the Game of
Life," same being profusely illus
trated by vivid allusions to athletic
games and contests in which young
people, especially, fondly engage.
We will not attempt to give an epi
tome of the splendid address, which
must be heard to be appreciated.
Suffice it to say that it was replete
with inspiration, encouragement and
wholesome advice for young players
upon the arena of life. One thought
that was emphasized was that of
team workeach one doing his or
her allotted work in life not so much
for individual glory or benefit, as for
^.the glory and benefit of society as a
wholesthe advancement and up
building of the human race. Each
one is a cog in the great human
wheel. Victories are won by the
combined endeavors of many work
ing in unison for one great aim.
Another thought dwelt upon was
that of true sportsmanship. A
chivalrous spirit should be cultivated
and the game of life played for its
own sake and not for the purpose of
injuring rivals or opponents in the
contest.
At the close of Dr. Vincent's ad
dress Mr. Prytz sang a solo very
acceptably and then Dr. Vinvent act
ing for L. Lamberson, president of
the School Board, presented the dip
lomas to the graduates. Another
song by the High School Chorus and
the pronouncing of the benediction
by Rev. David Samson closed the
program. Supt. Mitchell, the teachers,
school board, parents and citi
zens of Warren, have reason to con
gratulate themselves upon the happy
termination of another successful
school year.

Serious Auto Accident.
Albert Haugen, the nineteen year
old son of John O. Haugen, of Fol
dahl, met with a series auto accident
last Wednesday, that came very near
being fatal, and would have been so,
but for the skillful surgical assis
tance and good care that has been
given him. He and three other boys
were out riding in the evening in a
new car just bought that day and
while speeding at the rate of thirty
miles an hour the car was wrecked,
Albert being caught under the car
when it upset and received a horri
ble fracture of the skull that laid
bare the brain. After being given
first aid by Dr. Hoiland, of Argyle,

was performed on the skull, after
which his condition began to im
prove rapidly and at present writing
good hopes are entertained for his
complete recovery.
