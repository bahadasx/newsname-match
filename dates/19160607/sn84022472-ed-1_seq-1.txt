Ten Million Dollar Scheme
is Being Evolved Through
Gathering of Prominent
Citizens Who Have Taken
Up Bridgeport's. Great
Problem of Providing
I Workingmen With Homes
Housing Committee of
Chamber of Commerce
Will Be the Medium
Through, Which Further
Steps Will Be Taken
Plan is to Make Bridge
port So Attractive Skilled
Labor Will Stay Here.
The necessity of housing: to retain
the prestige of local factories subse
quent to the European war, thus to
make "Bridgeport the greatest skilled
labor center of the United States and
to permit of enlarged industrial scope
of present manufactures here has
caused one of the largest " combina
tions of -capitalists ever banded to-
- gether .here for civic welfare.
As a result of organized stimulation
of public sentiment, through the me
dium of the press and professional
'boosters," a movement is now on
foot to concentrate the various individual-'
manufacturing, civic, banking,
amusement and housing forces of the
city with a view to erecting nearly
$20,000,000 worth of houses, either in
this city or in some community ad-
"3acent to Bridgeport.
The initial work " of securing sub
scriptions for the propaganda that
has lately stimulated public interest
was carried on through the medium of
a. group of industrial, social, business
and banking men of this city who are
satisfied that no one 6rganization in
the city is capable- of bringing that
public interest to a scheme that would
- involve the gathering of such an enor
mous capital as is believed to be re
quired. ,
The stimulus to said to have inter
ested nearly every large manufactur
er and' many business men in this
city with the result that a committee
. has been' formed for the . purpose of
studying the economic situation and
eventually pursue . the campaign
through the Chamber of Commerce of
this city. ,

SISTER, EXPERT
IN DRUGS, CALLED
FROM HOSPITAL
St. Vincent's Hospital Phar
, macist Assigned to Balti
more College.
After several years at St. "Vincent's
hospital, during which she distin
guished herself by "the excellence of
her work, Sister Helena, the hospital
pharmacist, has been called to St. Jo
seph's College, Baltimore. She left
her post here Sunday for the new po
sition. The loss of Sister Helena is felt not
only by the hospital executives and
attaches, but' by vphysicians and sur
geons of the city, who found her aid
invaluable. Sister Helena was the
only registered pharmacist in a com
munity hospital, in Connecticut, and
she was was one of the few registered
women pharmacists connected with
hospitals. She passed the Connecti
cut pharmacy examinations with an
exceptionally high mark. ,
Sister Helena, had charge of the
X-ray department at the hospital,
besides the pharmacy and her work
there was very efficient. So indispen
sable had she become that it is likely
a. strong effort will be made to have
her reassigned to St. Vincent's. It is
known that many members of the
medical profession will urge her, re
turn. Bidgefield Banker

The cyclist was proceeding at a fair
speed. Virelli's machine passed him.
at Baird's Machine Co., but it was
only tor a moment. Like a flash the
motorcycle dashed by and sped along,
according to the state policeman's
speedometer, at the .rate of 45 mile

and followed the racer - until he
reached Yellow Mill bridge. Here the
cyclist in turning Connecticut avenue
took a. spill on the wet pavement.
Wheeler took the number; of the mo

FOILED IN ATTE
Emm CONVENTI
Chicago, June 7. Radicals in the
Progressive party started an insurgent
movement against the selection of
Walter Brown, of Ohio, as temporary
chairman', shortly before the national
convention opened in the Auditorium
this noon.
The radicals' plan was squelched,
however, by Gov. Hiram Johnson, of
California. It was the intention of
the radicals to nominate Johnson
against Brown, but when he heard of
the move the California executive de
clined "to be a party to discord."
A tentative draft of the Progressive
platform formed by a committee of
leaders today shows that the principal
appeal of the party will be made on
preparedness with Americanism as the
foundation. It discusses preparedness

CHICAGO, JUNE 7 JOHN T. KING OF BRIDGEPORT HAS
BEEN ELECTED REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN
FROM CONNECTICUT. ,
HE SUCCEEDS JUDGE W. F. HENNEY, OF HARTFORD.
Chicago, June 7 New York Republicans supporting Justice
Hughes' said today that they had been informed from reliable
sources that under no circumstances would Col. Roosevelt sup
port Justice Hughes if he were nominated by the Republican
convention.
A report that Col. Roosevelt had said in Oyster Bay that he I
would favor a third party ticket if Hughes were the Republican,!
nominee brought forth the statement from the Hughes men.
Governor .Whitman, leader of the Hughes faction of the New.
York delegates, smiled when he was told of the reported Roose- ;
velt statement. The governor said he knew nothing of reports
that the Justice would decline to run if a third ticket was put in
to the field. ,
Colonel To Run If Hughes Is Named
Oyster Bay, N. Y., June 7 While Colonel Roosevelt refram- ,
ed from making any public statement officially disclosing his
real attitude toward the political situation in Chicago, it is well
known to his intimates here that he is opposed to the noj-iina-tion
ol Justice Hughes and it is their confident belief that ii"
Justice Hughes is nominated Colonel Roosevelt will himself
become a candidate.
Col. Roosevelt and one of his sec
retaries, Walter Hayes, remained a
good part of last night at this' end
of " the private telephone wire between
Sagamore Hill and the Progressive
party headquarters in Chicago. The
Colonel said this morning there was
no statement he cared to- make ex
cept to repeat that he was "rieither
for nor against any candidate."
While the nature of the telephone
conversation is not allowed to trans
pire, Colonel Roosevelt's followers
here assert that reports from his lieu
tenants in Chicago are favorable to
the Colonel's candidacy. Only the

HUGHES SUPPORTERS ARE HOPEFUL
G.O. P. CONVENTION IS STARTED
Chicago, June 7 When the Repub
lican and Progressive conventions as
sembled today there was no outward
evidence of a marked change in' the
situation. Overnight conferences
among the leaders failed to develop
a nv definite plan on whlcn tney couia
agree on a candidate who would re
ceive the undivided support of both
factions but talk of peace was in the
-i- tvi nrnnnsal to have both con
ventions appoint conference commit
tees was being discussed on doiq
sides.
rr'v, nnv,itinn leaders themselves
were so engrossed in petty details of
getting under way, taking care or dele
gations from their own states and
guests, that they had little time for
further serious discussion of candi
dates and realized that the considera-
i, r.t that nuestion had actually
moved to the conventions themselves.
Tt there was any change at all in
the lineup ' over night, it showed an
in the strength of Hughes.
For the most part, the figures of man
agers of favorite son booms were not
changed.
Henrv Ford's secretary m Jjetron
today denied a report that Mr. Ford
vioj notified the Michigan Republican
delegation that they should , vote for
.TiiRtice Huehes after they had voted!
for Ford on the first ballot.
On this the convention day or two
parties, bringing together more than
1,000 delegates, tnere was noi a sign
stration or a band naradine
until an hour before time of assembly.
TViia ia nartiallv exDlained bv the
notable lack of demonstration which
had been one. of the unique features
of this convention period. As the hour
afifiAmhlirte annroached. the bands
and the delegates started moving to
ward the conventions halls. They
were a sorry rain-soaked and be
draggled looking lot as they marched
in.
The rain which began yesterday
noon continued over night and this
morning.
Policemen were at their stations
early as were physicians and nurses
assigned for emergency purposes. The
police were particularly alert for en
terprising but ticketless persons who
might attempt to gain entrance
through windows and coal chutes.
Such exploits have been attempted
here before at national conventions
but none was reported today.
Early today there was considerable
talk among both Republican and Pro
gressive leaders of peace plans al
though it was sai ' that nothing dif
ferent had been decided upon.

lors are permitted to talk over the wire
which is guarded by employes of the
telephone company all along the lino
to prevent. any possibility of a leak.
Col. Roosevelt, it is well understood,
is not at. all satisfied with Justice
Hughes' socalled "flag speech," which I
he is said fo regard as having no value i
as disclosing the Justice's attitude to-
ward the issues of the day. xIn the '
words of his followers here, the Col- .;
onel regards the speech as further "ev- ;
idence of pussyfooting" in the present :
crisis in the .country's affairs. '
Col. Roosevelt, it is known, feels bet- j
ter today in regard to. his own chances ;
toward being nominated than at any?
other time.
Both sides seemed desirous of bring
ing about harmony if possible. The
plan is said to be to have both con
ventions appoint a harmony, confer
ence .committee as soon as practica
ble. '
' It was pointed out that this plan
would be more satisfactory than hav
ing the negotiations contiue as they
have thus far, winiout definite au
thority from the delegates. The first
suggestion made was for the national
committees of both parties to name
conference committee but Chairman
Hilles expressed the opinion that it
would be better to have both conven
tions act on the subject.
Among Progressive leaders the plan,
most favored, according to Walter
Brown of Ohio, was a motion for a
peace committee formally offered to
the convention by George W. Perkins,
the floor leader, placing the whola
matter in the hands of the commit
tee. The appointment of such a com
mittee, it was pointed out, would
merely be conforming to the amity
proposition made by the Progressive
national committee last winter.
The rain Was falling on ticket-holders
waiting at various entrances when,
an hour and a half ahead of the mo-;
raent set for the convention to come
to order the doors were opened. A
band placed in a hanging balcony un-
der the eaves of the north end of the
building began to play. Chief of Po
lice Healy and his assistants made a
final Inspection of the vast structure
and reported " all well," to Sergeant- .
at-Arms Stone.
Twenty minutes before the hour
set for the convention to be called to
order, great reaches of vacant seats
marked the floor and galleries. As
the band played, the police tried to
make the delegates crowding the aisles
take their seats.
The favorite sons delegations, plac
ed directly 'before the speaker's plat
form, began on the right wjth Michl- .
gan. Missouri. . Illinois, Ohio, New
York, Pennsylvania and Iowa. The
seats were filled.
The order was given to clear the
aisles at 10:59 and the police began
moving out all who were not dele
gates and forcing the delegates to their
sections.
Sergeant-at-Arms Stone asked the
delegates to be seated, his voice being '
carried above the noise of conversa
tion and cries of his assistants on the
floor.
Temporary Chairman Harding as
cended the . platform amid applaus i
and was introduced at 11:50 a. rru
