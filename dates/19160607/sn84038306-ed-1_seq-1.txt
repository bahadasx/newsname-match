On« of the most destructive wind
and rain storms in more than twenty
years swept over northern part of
Delaware and Clayton counties Iwt
Friday night, doing damage which
will figure up to many hundreds of
thousands of dollars. In fact the
greater part of northeastern Iowa suf
fered heavily. At North McGregor
a veritable cloudburst caused -a flood,
ttfe like of which has never been
known. The streams in the hilly
country towards the Mississippi river
became raging torrents, carrying des
truction before the®. At McGregor
the CMcago Milwaukee ft St Paul
railway suffered severely. The
roundhouse, was wrecked, hundreds of
freight cars and locomotives were
tumbled together, and for miles the
track and all bridges were washed
away. It is estimated that it will
take a month to rebuild the road ao
as to make it possible for traffic to
be resumed. All trains on the river
division are being detoured from Du
buque to Charles City over the Illi
nois Central by way of Manchester
and Waterloo.
While a large amount of water leu
in the northern part of the county,
the damage done in this way was
slight compared to that wrought by
the cyclone. The storm seemed tq
gain its first hold at the Chas. Barf
farm, where practically all of the
buildings except the dwelling house
were wrecked. At the Ambrose Mc
Elmeel farm a large silo and a grove
of evergreen trees were destroyed.
A part of the roof of the home was al
so torn off. At

TEMPORARY INJUNC
TION ^DISSOLVED
HEARING ON MOTION TO DIS
SOLVE INJUNCTION HAD
LA8T FRIDAY
CONDEMNATION SUIT STILL PENDING
District At Liberty to Erect Building,
If willing to Assume Risk cf
Adverse Decision.
The case of Holbert vs Consolidat
ed School District of Oneida, was be
fore Judge Boies on Friday of last
week for hearing on a motion of the
School District to dissolve an injunc
tion restraining the School District
from proceeding with the erection of
the new school house at Oneida.
At the opening of Court Saturday
morning former Judge Ransier, of
counsel from th* plaintiff stated that
his client, Mr. Holbert, would not
resist the dissolution of the injunc
tion, but would try out the questions
upon the trial of the condemnation
suit, under which the School District
is attempting to obtain the land, at
which time Mr. Holbert would insist
that the tract of land selected is not
upon a pulbic highway and therefore
wag not subject to condemnation.
That what is claimed to be Hoag
Avenue in Oneida was never legally
dedicated as a highway, nor opened
and used as such and that Mr. Hol
bert and Mr. Hoag have used it for
many years for farming purposes
that under such circumstances a con
demnation would be illegal, and if
the court should so hold the schopl
district would have to remove the
school build(ng and restore the land
to its present condition.
Further that if the court should
hold against Mr. Holbert on that
point, the question would then be tried
whether the amount allowed by th«
appraisers should not be greatly in
creased as compensation for taking
the only four acres of desirable build
ing site on the entire farm.
Judge Boies then dissolved the in
junction and the condemnation case
will come up for trial at some future
term of court.
In the meantime, the school district
is at liberty to go ahead with the
building, if it is willing to asumse
the risk'of an advrse decision when
the condemnation, case ..comes before
the court.
