ATIAIITIC COAST LIKE OFFICIAL
: CO-OPERATE WITH
J. C. Murchison, division superin
tendent' of the Atlantic Coast Line,
says that he is ready and anxious to
meet at any time with the people of
Ocala with a view to working out on
a "common sense" basis the . prob
lems that confront the city and his
road, and in so saying' he has partic
ular reference to the much debated
question of improvements in the
freight -yards here. He thinks that
the city and his road can reach decis
ions that will be of benefit to both,
and does not believe that anything
can 'be, accomplished by the city and
railroads working apart.
Mr. Murchison is here today with
Robert Taylor, a former Ocalan,
travelingfreight agent of the Coast
Line. Asked if he was here for any
special purpose, Mr. Murchison said
that he was here merely to look things
over .in a general way. ; He said that
his road did not contemplate any
changes in the freight yards at once,
but said that he would dome to Ocala
at any time that the people of the
city "desired to' have a conference on
any matter. - '
"I believe in working these things
out on a common sense basis Mr.
Murchison said. v "That is the way I
shall work." , -; '
Mr. Murchison referred to the diff
erences that have existed . between.
his road and the city, and he said that
he. hoped that under his administra
tion as general superintendent of this
division it would be possible to reach
agreements satisfactory to all parties
concerned. . '
, Mr. Taylor said that Ocala looked
good to him, and he expressed him
self as pleased to hear of .the enter
prises and developments here.' 4
SEWERAGE WORK
IS SATISFACTORY
Engineers Henny and Drake Have
Given It Careful Inspection
Mr. David Henney, of Twombly &
Henney, engineers, informed council
last night that, with City Engineer
Drake, he had inspected the sewer
age work in the I city propert and
found it satisfactory. Acceptance of
the sewerage ; system in the city
proper, including the Imhoff tank,
was recommended. This was done,
and council paid to Twombly & Hen
ney and to Bryan & Co., the contrac
tors, sums due them on the work.
Mr. Henney pointed out that extras
on the entire sewerage work would
be about $700, which he thought was
very low. '

been completed. ' ' '

FOn WATER MAINS
City Attorney is of the Opinion that
Funds Can be Used if
Necessary
Frederick Hocker, city attorney, is
of the opinion that, the city can use
a part of the sewer bond money in
laying water mains, ; provided that
the water mains are necessary to put
the sewerage system in operation.
The city attorney was asked for
this opinion recently when council
had under consideration the addi
tional water mains needed to flush
the sewers. It was said at the time
time that a bond - issue : of about
$25,000 might be necessary for the
purpose of laying the water mains;
DECIDED IN FAVOR
OF THE CITY
Judge Bullock has decided in favor
of the city in the case against R. L.
Anderson in the matter of street
paving certificates. The demurrer
filed by Mr. Anderson has been over
ruled by the court, and this, accord
ing to the city attorney, means that
the city will win the fight that was
begun about 1909. . ' .
The case against Mr. Anderson in
volves street paving certificates to
the amount of about $1000. A test
case was brought by the city to fore-
Magnolia street involving .$300, and
Mr.' Anderson filed a demurrer.

Most Quiet on Record
SHADOW OF IMPEflDIHG DEFEAT tEEMS TO HOVER OVER THE
GBAHD OLD PARTY AT CHICAGO
(Associated Press)
" The Coliseum, Chicago, June 7.
With the most remarkable lack of
demonstrations in the history of the
party, the republican national 1 con
vention opened at 11:25 "o'clock this
morning. The convention was called
to order by Chairman Hilles of the
national committee. The audience
stood and sang two verses of "Amer
ica." Rev. John Stone of Chicago,
offered a prayer.
Chairman Hilles then asked every
one to stand to be photographed.
The convention was photographed,
while seated, however.
: Secretary Reynolds was applauded
as he read the call. There were no
demonstrations as the leaders enter
ed ; the hall before the jConvention
opened. Messrs. Lodge,' Crane,
Penrose, Hitchcock and others enter
ed unrecognized." Senator Depew was
received with hand clapping by the
New ' York delegation. ; '
" There were large vacant spaces in
the galleries. The favorite sons del
egations were seated directly before
the speakers platform. : From right
to left wer6 Michigan, Missouri,. Il
linois, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania
and Iowa. The first cheer of the day
came when every one arose as' the
band played the Star Spangled Ban
ner. Then all was quiet and the aisles
cleared. . . i "
Chairman Hilles presented the
name of Senator Warren G. Harding
as temporary chairman. . Applause
followed. This was the first dem
onstration of the convention. There
were no other nominations and Hard
ing was declared elected.'
IN -FAVOR OF A BIG NAVY
Chairman Harding spoke for an
hour and twenty minutes. There was
a sustained demonstration when he
declared for a navy fearing none in
the world. , Temporary officers were
approved, .and adjournment was
taken at 11 o'clock until tomorrow.
No outward evidence marked a
change in the situation as the conven
tion convened. Peace talk is still in
the air. Most of the republicans ex
pect nominations to begin Friday,
though - some think eleventh hour
peace negotiations may delay thin
feature until next week.
WATER TANK WAS NEAR
DRY LAST SATURDAY
Between One and Two O'Clock There
was Only Six Inches in the ..;
Standpipe '
For the first time in probably a
long time the city water tank was
nearly empty Saturday afternoon. Be
tween 1 and 3 o'clock there was about
six inches of water in the tank. It
seems that Engineer Spanner of
Bryan & Co., turned on water to flush
the new sewers, and in doing so turn
ed on the wrong cocks, which drew
the water, out of the tank. The reser
voir at the water station was full,
however, and would have taken
care of a fire. '
When the matter was brought up
in council last night, at the instance
of Councilman Meff ert it was decid
ed that in the future no one be al
lowed to turn on water from the
mains except the superintendent of
the waterworks, or the chief of the
fire department, or persons , having
permission from these two author

SILVER MEDA L CONTEST
There was a silver medal contest at
Electra Sunday night. The house
was full to overflowing of interested
people, and all were pleased with the
program. Rev. Gorbett had come to
preach, but he gave way for the con
test, and we believe the talk he made
on the subject of temperance did as
much good as his regular sermon
would have done. It was one of the
best talks on that subject that we
have heard for many a day. The
speaking was all good and the medal
was awarded to Miss Marzella Mock,
and was presented by Mr. Gus Wat
ers. The judges were Messrs. Stana

Washburn. The contest had been an
nounced for several weeks, and the
crowd came from all the surrounding
country, the use of the numerous au
tomobiles making this possible.
