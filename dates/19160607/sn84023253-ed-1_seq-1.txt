Caused Considerable Disturbance at
Lyndonville Last Eveniug
Section Men AU Out.
(Special to The Caledonian.)
Lyndonville, June 5. The Passump
sic division of the Boston & Maine
railroad has only one or two section
men at work now, the remainder hav
ing gone on a strike. The company
today imported 15 or 18 strikebreak
ers from Boston and vicinity, who
arrived on the northbound Air Line.
The men were ignorant that a strike
was on and when they learned the
facts refused to go to work. Evident
ly they had been without anything to
eat all day and the road refused to
furnish them food when they refused
to work. This angered them so they
caused considerable disturbance about
the depot and the police and States At
torney Norton were called. They
quelled the men and remained on
guard until the midnight train ar
rived when the men left for Boston.
They were an ugly loking let of fel
lows, some of them Italians and others
low grade Americans and much anxi
ety was felt over the situation until
the officers got them under control.
The 25 cent piece was made
famous by the American Liver
Tablets, the perfect laxative.

Indebtedness.
Dedication week at Grace Methodist
church opened most aucpiciously Fri
day night with a big banquet in the as
sembly room, served by the Ladies'
Aid society at which 300 covers were
laid. Grave was offered by Rev. Joseph
Hamilton of Randolph, a former pre
siding elder of this district, and dur
ing the dinner hour piano selections
were rendered by Miss'Eklof.
The postprandial exercises were in
charge of the pastor of the church,
Rev. George A. Martin, who was most
felicitous in his introductions. Rev.
Clarence L. Eaton brought the greet
ings from the Church of the Messiah,
congratualting the church first upon
their achievement and second upon
their leader. And lastly he congrat
ulated the church because of the loy
alty and self-sacrifice of its people that
have made possible the erection of
such a beautiful edifice.
Mr. Martin expressed his thanks to
the thoughtf ulness of the pastor of the
North church in offering that church
for the Methodists after the tire and
said he regretted that a previous en
gagement detained Mr. Richards. He
also said thanks were due Rev. Paul
D. Moody for making a similar offer
on behalf of the South church and
next Introduced him. Mr. Moody
said he had been inspired by the work
that had gone on here and said it was
so beautiful that he was almost afraid
some people might be tempted to set
their church on fire. Though it rep.
resented the work of one denomina
tion he thanked God that we all be
longed after all to one church the
church of Christ in St. Johnsbury.
Rev. E. Fairbanks.
Rev. Dr. Edward T. Fairbanks
spoke In a reminiscent vein of the ded
ication of the former structures on
this site without any banquets. He
saia our ioreiatners missed a
great deal, though when the first
meeting house was built In St. Johns
bury they consumed ten gallons of
rum at the dedication. In closing he
paid deserved tributes to the early
pastors of the church, now gone to
their reward.
Miss Kahlo of Portland, Me., the
deaconess of the church under two
pastorates, said words were too inad
equate to express her real feelings.
confessing that the magnificent edifice
was far beyond her anticipations.
Rev. Dr. C. H. Merrill brought the
greetings of the Congregational de
nomination in Vermont, saying that
the way in which out of disaster you
have achieved success is worthy of
note. You have found It easier to ac
complish a great thing than a small
one. The new building is an asset
in church efficiency in which we can
all share.
Rev. Fred Wilcock, pastor of the
Center church, brought the greetings
of the mother church. He said his
church looked at her daughter, with
the same pride that a mother beheld
her own daughter.- Our message to
you is to press on with vigor, but in
the midst of your rejoicings and busi
ness eare do not forget the mother
church.
Congratulatory letters were read at
this time from Rev. W. S. Smithers,
pastor of the church In the early
nineties; Mrs. Caroline F. Harvey and
her two daughters of Washington;
Miss Lucy M. Sinclair and Mrs. Caleb
H. Marshall, the only one now living
of the founders of the first church.
Mr. Simonds for Congregation.
Robert W. Simonds spoke for the
congregation, making a decided hit by
opening an effective address with the
words, "Fellow Methodists and Visit
ing Sinners." He said after the church
burned down there was so much en
thusiasm to rebuild that the people
had to get into the boat or drown.
There isn't a Methodist but what is
intent on making this church what It
should be, and what under its past and
present leadership it must be.
A. L. Bailey, who had been on the
building committees of the different
structures spoke largely in a reminis
cent vein, and after describing num
erous incidents relative to the con
struction of the edifices told of various
trips after the pastors that were
among the guests of this occasion.

The first meeting of the new year
of the St. Johnsbury Woman's club
was held in Pythian hall, Monday aft
ernoon, June 5, at 3 o'clock, the presi.
dent, Mrs. Helen L. Stone, presiding.
The minutes of the annual meeting
were read by the recording secretary,
Mrs. Martha French. The treasurer
reported $119.19 to be in the general
funds. The executive board, in their
meeting at 2 o'clock, appropriated $25
to the travel and current events com
mittee, $10 to the education commit
tee and in co-operation with the Com
mercial club of St. Johnsbury the ex
ecutive board voted $5 for the relief
of war sufferers. The district nurse
reported 570 calls made up to and

mittee on resolutions upon the death
of a club member, Mrs. Harry Scott
was appointed by the president and

man; Mrs. Frank Taylor and Mrs.

The meeting was then given over to
the forestry committee, Mrs. Edith
Flint, chairman. First upon the pro
gram was a solo by Frank Brooks,
"King of the Forest Am I." Follow
ing this Miss Alice Wilcox read a few
choice gems, including Henry Van
Dyke's famous psalm of the forest.
Mrs. Flint then introduced Hubbard
Hastings, a St. Johnsbury boy, grad
uate of the Biltmore School of For
estry in Carolina and Germany. Mr
Hastings' brief talk was about the
wood lots of the small farms and the
problem of the farmer for the con
sefvation of" these. He spoke of the
great waste of valuable timber caused
in part by ignorance on the part of
the owner and by the inability of the
owner to get at it. He prophesied a
famine in timber in the United States
in years to come which would affect
all branches of American industry and
would raise the prices of all necessary
commodities. The club, on conclusion
of Mr. Hastings' talk gave him and
Mr. Brooks a rising vote of thanks.
