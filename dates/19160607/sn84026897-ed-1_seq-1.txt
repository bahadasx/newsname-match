THIRD ANNUAL H]
SCHC
Exercises Highly Cr?dita
Department. Large
At no time in the past have the
commencement exercises been more
thoroughly enjoyed than they were
last week. The people have been
lavish in their praise, every word of
which was deserved.
The hig'h school commencement
began Wednesday tiisrht with the
annual celebration by the McDufiie
literary society. There were five
young ladies, Misses Annie May
Culbreath, Janice Morgan, Lydia
Brunson, Ouida Pattison and Em
mie Broadwater, to compete for a
medal offered at the beginning of j
the session by Mr. Geo. F. Mims
for the one who recited best. This
' honor, together with the gold]
medal, fell to the lot of Miss Em-j
mie Broadwater.
The young men, Douglas Tim
merman, Pendleton Gaines, Edwin
Folk, Glover Tompkins and Can oil
Rainsford, competed for a gold
medal that was given by Mr. Or
landa Sheppard for the one most
giftjd in declamation. This was
won by Carroll Rainsford. The
judges in both contests were Prof.
Scott of Trenton, Prof. Blakely of
Ora, and Mrs. Feltham of Edgefield.
In presenting the medals Prof. Scott
commended the teachers and mem
bers of the literary society for the
splendid work they have done dur
ing the past session.
Thursday night, the only pay
night of the commencement, the
members of the eleventh grade gave
a comedy in four acts, entitled "Cu
pid, the Conqueror." Every part
was well rendered. Indeed we have
never before heard so much com
mpntupop an ej^j^irinignj; of^this
characterT^nd it is conceded the
best play ever presented in Edge
field by amateurs The sum of]
$75.00 was realized for the school, j
The graduating exercises of the
high school were held in the audito
rium of the building Friday night.
There were nine to complete the
course and a large number of relar
tives and friends gathered to witness
their graduation. Those who re
ceived diplomas were: Misses Jeanie
Simkins, Lallie Peak, Ida Folk,
Annabelle Saunders, Ruth Lyon,
Helen Dorn, Rhea Edmunds, Wil
liam and Diomede Hollingsworth.
The salutatory was read by Miss
Jeanie Simkins and the valedictory
by Miss Ida Folk. Miss Lallie
Peak read a paper entitled, "Four
Decades of Edgefield History-17S5
to 1825." The Edgefield chapter,
D. A. R., some time ago offered a
prize of $5.00 in gold to the high
school pupil who wrote the best es
say on this subject. Miss Lallie
Peak's was selected as the best by
the committee of judges. It con
tained much valuable information
concerning the early settlement of
Edgefield.
The diplomas were presented by
Arthur S. Tompkins, secretary of
the board of trustees, and A. E.
Padgett made a report of the finan
cial status of the school.
The literary address before the
graduating class, was delivered by
L. T. Baker, dean of thc University
of South Carolina. The speaker
stated that while there was need for
vocational and practical education,
yet that which is needed most is the
development of the inherent powers
within. The possibilities of what
a human life may achieve are almost
without limit, but we are utilizing
but a small per cent, of our force.
He referred to the achievements of
Napoleon, Washington, Goethe and
other celebrities, stating that instead
of these standing out isolated and
alone as conspicuous examples of
greatness, the average of the human
race should and will yet, if they de
velop their powers to the maximum,
measure up to these.
Mr. Lyon offered a medal at the
opening of the session to be awarded
to the hitrh school pupil who made
the highest average for the session,
and this was won by Miss Margaret
May. This honor tell to her at the
close of the last session. Dr. J. S.
Byrd offered a medal to the pupil of
the school who made the most im
provement during the session, and
this was won by Master Elbert
Mundy. Thcise medals were pre

jsented by Dr. Jones. The prize
which the D. A. R. offered was pre
sented to Miss Lallie Peak by the
Rev. A. L. Gunter.
Early in the session the Edgefield
chapter, United Daughters of the
Coufederacy, offered two prizes, one
for the best paper on the Subject,
"Was Robert E. Lee a Traitor?"
and a second prize for the second
best paper. The first prize, ?5.00
in'gold, was won by Miss Margaret
May, and the second pme, a bistory
by Miss Mildred Rutherford, was
won by Miss Ouida Pattison.
The recital given Saturday night
by Miss Couch's music pupils was
highly creditable. Several selec
tions were rendered by violin pupils
who had been taking lessons on this
difficult instrument but a short time,
and yet they performed with re
markable ease and grace. The pu
pils on the piano, both the begin
nen and advanced pupils, played \
beautifully, reflecting credit upon i
themselves and their very capable
teacher. The following is the pro

Prof. Lyon has been warmly con
gratulated upon the very successful
session that has just closed, and
upon the highly creditable com
mencement exercises. The words
of commendation are well deserved.
Statistics of the War.
We don't kuow to what extent
reliance may be placed in statis
tics. But figures are interesting,
anyway.
The statisticians say that at the
present rate of the war Germany
will in August begin to show such
a weakening of forces that the
Teuton allies cannot much longer
maintain the long lines they are now
manning. It is said that the
German losses have been 2,200,00
in 21 months of warfare. The net
loss, after considering the new
classes of youth enlisted, are declar
ed to be 1,100,000; and not much
reserve to be drawn upon in the
way of growing youth of military
age.
At the outset of the war it was
estimated that Germany was capa
ble of putting 7,000,000 men into
the field. It is declared that there
are now in ranks 9,000,000 men,
from the Central powers and 14,
000,000 from the allie&.-Columbia
Record.
Had Pleasant Trip.
Gen. M. L. Bonham and sons, Dr.
M. L. Bonham, Jr., and Mr. Proctor
A. Bonham of Greenville, returned
Thursday night from Saluda and
Edgefield counties where they speut
a few days during the past week.
Gen. Bonham went to visit his an
cestral home. He stated yesterday
that he had an especially interesting
trip, and that the crops down there
were much further advanced than in
this section.-Anderson Intelli

Refreshing Rains Fallen. Farm
Work Being Rushed. Com
>?M. mencement a Great
Success.
-"
We certainly he pe those Texas
people have had as good seasons of
rain as we have been blessed with.
The wind blew hard all day Satur
day and the clouds boiled and dis
persed and came together again and
again. Finally the rain came down
slowly and gently where we were.
There was a good deal of electricity
all the while though nearer night
ancl'.after midnight <.here wa9 a good
deal more lightning and thunder
and more rain.
The peas are being sowed by the
quantity. Potatoes set, cotton chop
ped plowed and corn worked. Every
thing on the farm is on the rush
an? will be for two months or more.
But then is there ever a time when
there is nothing to do on a farm?
We have lived in the country on the
same tarm all cur lives and always
found more to be done than we ever
got done.
We hear the commencement in
North Augusta was a grand success.
A certain young man who attended
said, all the graduate young ladies
were so pretty from where he sat,
he could not decide which was the
prettiest. He would rather have a
closer inspection before he passed
his opinion. But as he went this
way . to see one we have an idea he
has. decided which was the prettiest,
Mrs. Ollie Bunch and Messrs.
Sampie and Mealing Bunch and Mr.
Frank Townes and Miss Mary
Townes spent Sunday afternoon at
Mrs. Georgia McKie's, and with
Mrs. Sallie Bunch. Also Mr. Harry
Bunch and family spent the after
noon with his mother who has been
very ill all the week with grip.
Miss Mary Townes h id a chill
and feeling fine again.
We hope malaria is not coming
down in our midst, we don't need
it.
We hear Miss Theresa Bunch is
still visiting relatives in Columbus,
Ga., where she has been for 8
weeks.
Mrs. Geo. Nixon is visiting ber
daughter, Mrs, Ollie Bunch. She
speaks of spending some time at her

FOUR DECADES I
EARLY 1
Essay Written by Miss
Contest Won
The strife of war is o'er
And the battle of peace begun,
But Edgefield shall weep no more,
For her liberty forever is won.
Edgefield, we love you, for in the
very beginning there was engender
ed in your loyal heart that element
of refinement and autocracy that
years nor the root of evil can efface.
This historic county until the
year 1785 was a part of Ninety Six
district. In this year a vast area of
that district formed the county of
which we now boast. Edgefield
county was much larger than it is
now. The Savannah river separated
it from Georgia. It was bounded on
the south west by the districts of
Orangeburg, Barnwell and a part
of Lexington; it was bounded on
the north by Newberry, and Abbe
ville served as its north western
boundary. It was forty-six miles
long and thirty-seven miles wide
containing 1,089,280 acres. Our
county was settled almost altogether
by immigrants from Virginia and j
North ^Carolina.
It contained several varieties of
soil; the sandy along the leaf pine
lands and a deep red soil along the
oak and hickory land. The main pro
ductions were peas, sweet potatoes,
beans, Indian corn, tobacco, wheat,
hemp and a small amount of cotton.
In the year 1785 the present site
was selected for the county seat of
justice. This picturesque site was
selected because of its healthful lo
cation and its beautiful springs of
sparkling water; for springs in those
days were ?Edgefield's ch:ef water
supplyy In the beaning ot/t?ES
r?i^ii:^^?yc^\^ry. .the." houses of
Edgefield town were very scattered,
numbering between forty and fifty.
There were about thirty-eight fami
lies living here then, and the popu
lation amounted to three hundred.
Just a mile north of Edgefield
court house at the fork of the Block
er and Ninety Six roads was the
little town of Pottersville, which
was founded by the ingenious Ab
ner Laundrura. This little town was
supported by the manufacture of
stoneware, which was begun and
carried out by the scientific discov
eries of Land rum. This stoneware
was made cheaper and proved bet
ter than any ware of the kind manu
factured by Europe or America.
Pottersville contained sixteen or
seventeen houses with as many fami
lies; it supported a regular acade
my with three teachers. There was
also a millinery shop there. These
people manufactured stage coaches
aud meat packing was a great in
dustry. At this time the people of
Edgefield were almost wholly de
pendent on the people of Potters
ville, especially for "old corn and
rye."
Arthur Simkins, an eminent
Revolutionary soldier and citizen,
came to South Carolina from Vir
ginia and settled at ''Cedar Field,"
near the county seat of Edge
field. The historic home of Arthur
Simkins with its terraced walks
and gardens, its fountains and con
servatories, its winding walks
among roses and lilacs, its fragrant
bowers of English honeysuckle has
crumbled into dust. The fine or
chards have, beeu converted into
prosaic cotton fields. A relic of the
past may be seen in cedar trees. The
storms of centuries have failed to
mar their beauty and symmetry.
Arthur Simkins donated to the
Baptists the property on which their
church now stands, and also the
lot that forms a part of beautiful
"Willow Brook" cemetery. Eldred
Simkins was the son of Arthur. Had
it not been for Eldred and Provi
dence the people of early Edgefield
would never have had the great
minister Basil Manly in their midst.
These men were intimately associat
ed at the university of South Caro
lina. When Simkins came home dur
ing vacation he invited Manly to
preach in the Edgefield court house.
His first sermon was in connection
with a young man who was to be
executed for committing murder.
This sermon was preached at the
request of the prisoner himself. An
other interesting character was Lo
renzo Dow, who was one one of the
first Metodist ministers who ever

preached in the court hoasj. He wag
a splendid orator, but possessed odd
characteristics. He always seemed
to be in haste. When be reached the
court bouse if a window was nearer
than a door, he would leap into the
window and immediately after he
had delivered his message, he woald
exit in the same manner. Joseph
Moore was a famous Methodist
minister here at this time. Richard!
Tutt built the first house in Edge
field in 1785. It stood where the
residence of Mr. "alter Adams
now stands. He was also one of the
first clerks of court. In the fonr
decades there were three besidea
Tutt namely, Stanmore Butler, M.
Miras and Daniel Byrd. One of tba
earliest of Edgefield's records re
corded in the clerk's office is this:
"Joseph Doolittle, state of Sooth
Carolina Edgefield district. Person
ally appeared who being duly sworn
deposeth and saith that on Satur
day the fifteenth of this instant in
an affray with Daniel Holsonback
in the said affray he this deponent
bit off the soft end of the said Hol1
sonback's right ear. Sworn to 20th
of March 1806 before me, Charles
Hammond. Joseph Doolittle. Re
corded March 26, 1806." At this
period a horse thief was branded
by a slash on the ea.r And this rec
ord is to vindicate this man from
disgrace.
In the war of 1812.; there were
many heroes sent from Edgefield,
the most prominent being Gen.
William Butler, Samuel Mays and
Captain Allen Addison. In the year
?ySU George J&cDofKe vm a dis
ting tt?gfi?f"laAvy'er here." He was
first made a legislator from Edge
field, next he was elected' governor
of South Carolina,, and next he was
sent to the United States Senate.
Geo. McDuffie deserves to be long
remembered as a hero of early
Edgefield, and it is in his honor that
our literary eociety ia named.
Edmund Bacon, familiarly known
to us as "Ned Brace," was a bril
liant lawyer in Edgefield as early as
1822. To read "Georgia Scenes" ia
but to love "Ned Brace." At the
age of fifteen he was given the hon
or of delivering the welcome ad
dress to President Washington at
Augusta when he made his southern
tour. Edmund Bacon is buried in
"Willow Brook" cemetery. In wan
dering there I found his grave with
this epitaph inscribed:
"Within this grave wrapt in last long
sleep
Lies one whose doom a wife and chil
dren weep
Whose many friends with anxious sighs
regret
The loss of virtue they can ne'er forget
The loss of virtue! no the mortal
form '
May waste beneath and feed the hun
gry worm."
The head that keenly felt another's
woe
The voice of eloquence with joyous
flow
May fade away or rest within the
gloom
Of death's dominion this cold and nar
row tomb
But the bright mind on wings of bliss
shall rse
To dwell immortal in its native skies.
The churches established in early
Edgefield were Methodist and Bap
tist. The first church in Edgefield
village was a Methodist, lt stood in
the grove near where the residence
of Mr. J. L. Miras now stand?. The
records of this church have become
extinct, and it was only through the
kindness of an elderly friend that I
obtained this knowledge. I obtained
information of the organization and
building of the first Baptist church
of Edgefield through records left
by Stanmore Butler Griffin, R. H,
and M. H. Mims. This church
was built on the same site on which
the church stands to-day. On Sun
day morning April 20, 1823, Mat
thew Mims j and Alexander Mc
Whorter were ordained deacons and
Rev. Basil Manly, the first pastor,
preached the dedication sermon.
The first Sunday school held in the
upper part of the state was held in
this church. It was organizad by
Miss Eliza Johnston Drysdale. The
first prayer meeting was held in
this church July 1825. To furnish
