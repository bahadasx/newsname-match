Last Legislature Names Tuesday,
June 20, for Improvement
on Roads.
The Legislature of the State has
wi^ly requested the designation by
public proclamation of the third
Tuesday of June in each year as
"g&od roads day."
More and more is the public
awakening to the necessity of road
improvement and the great value
and importance to permanent road
construction, which will lessen the
cost.of marketing of products and
continually increase the volume of
traffic. It is a well-known fact that
the farmers of our State on account
of bad roads are losing millions of
dollars annually in the moving of
their crops, aside from the loss oc­
casioned through the lower value of
their lands by reason of their in­
accessibility to market.
Good roads, however, influence
not only the economic but the social
conditions of a community by elim­
inating the lonel-iness ami isolation
of rural districts and by creating
better opportunities for school atten­
dances and social life.
Therefore, the people of the State
are hereby requested to make special
effort 011 Tuesday, the '2()th day of
line, to secure contributions of labor
material and money toward the im­
provement of public highways 111
their respective communities.
