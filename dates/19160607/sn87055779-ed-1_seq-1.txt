LONDON', June 7. All of the
British empire is in mourning today
lor Lord Kitchener, late secretary
c-f i-tute for war, who, with his staff,
were drowned, off the Scottish coast
when the cruiser Hampshire was
destroyed, by mine or torpedo on
.Monday night.
The girdle of ied around the

'nun the four quarters of the

pouring into Jvmdon.
It is likely that a. great memorial
erice will be held in St. Paul's or
Westminster Abbey to be attended
by Kins George and all the repre
sentatives of the government.
There was a meeting of the cab
inet this morning to discuss the sit
uation brought about by the death
f the sccietavy of war. upon whose
shoulders were borne the duty of
ondutting the military establish
ment of the empire.
1'lags are at half-mast every
where. Silent thrones Idled the
streets discussing the tra-md.
Think Spy Knew of Trip.
Despite the secrec y attending the
iit of Lord Kitc hener to Russia,
tlie belief is crow im: that the tjer-
man admiralty was notified of the
proposed trip by a spy and that the
Hampshire was blown up through
some a ,'ency of Germany, perhaps
a submarine.
Insistent demands are in in; made

cago. June 7. Sticky lothes, wet
shoes and an atmosphere that reeked
with the smell of waterproofs; these
were the elements that prevailed to
day when the progressives conven
tion opened in the Auditorium thea
ter and proceeded to make history
in brisk chapters.
Just before the convention opened
the .Michigan delegates entered the
theater with a great standard bear
ing a likeness of Iioosevelt.
They stood before their chairs
singing: "Oh. You Teddy," "We're
going to put you there." The Penn
sylvania delegation arose and waved
flags.
The band which hid been playing
the familiar "Toreador" song from
Carmen, surrendered as the Roose
velt enthusiasm echoed from the far
corridors of the big auditorium.
"When Teddy comes marching
home." was their inarching song.
' Columbus. New Mexico. wants
Teddy," said one.
It was displayed to the accom
paniment of a wild outburst of cow
boy yells.
Then George W. Perkins, the
chairman of the executive commit
tee, made his appearance on the
platform.
"Three cheers for -Mr. Perkins,"
yelled a delegate.
They gave them with a will.
Pound after round of applause came
tor the man who has led the moose
headquarters from the opening of
the party's career.
Victor Murdock advanced to the
stand at 1-:-'. and formally called
tie convention to order. Kansas In
terrupted him w ith a shout. Then
order came and with it the an
nouncement that the convention
would be opened with prayer by
Ihshop William Fraser McDowell.
"We will rise as is fitting and sing
Amni'-a." said the chairman follow
ing the prayer. The delegates arose
and made tic hall ring with the
great song.
A photographer aimed his camera
at tlie body, cat loose a great Hash,
ami put the gathering into the pic
ture in the history of politics.
Sec'y O. K. Da is came to the
front with the official call for the
convention. He read the call to a
body which was not particularly
fond of political prose, but which
hoard him with attention.
Mr. Uobbins got a mighty oa
tion as he came to the stand. When
Victor Murdock announced the se
lection of Mr. potbins the conven
tion instantly ratified It. Johnson of
California. Strauss of New York and
Varker of Louisiana were named to
escort Mr. Uobbins to the chair and
tlan at the Murdock suggestion the

Hvery state chairman in the pro
gressive party ranks was sitting on
the lal when the convention began
to assemble today. They were a t
in,; under positive orders to prevent
an explosion. There was no attempt
to disguise the fact that the rank
and rile of the mooe had run wild.
'We want Teddy:" was the weird
chant that possessed them.
It was a battle cry that had no

no .second thought.

EFFORT FOR PEACE
Lansing Inquiry of Gerard Re

Time Not Ripe.
Ilitenuttiull.il New Seivce;
WASHINGTON. June 7. Diplq
matic leaders here today were firmly
convinced that there is not now a
possibility that Pres't Wilson will
make any efforts at an early date to
obtain peace in Kurope. The dispatch
of a cablegram by Sec'y Lansing to
Ambassador Gerard asking whether
Gerard has been advocating an early
peace is believed to be a sure indi
cation that the administration does
not desire to have the attention of
the woild centered upon this coun
try as the gate through which peace
is most likely to come.
While it is improbable that an ac
tion will be taken even if Ambassa
dor Gerard admits that he advo
cated an early peace, diplomats say
the Irnsing inquiry has consider
erable significance.
One neutral diplomat said today
that the inquiry was made because
of indications tlvat the central pow
ers are now making a last grand ef
fort to hurl their armies on to vic
tory and that the American govern
ment has been told that until the
high tide of these efforts has been
passed it will be quit.- useless to
seek to set in motion th? machinery
of peace.

nly Theodore Roosevelt can pre
vent tho placing in the field of a re
publican national ticket and a pro
gressive one for the coming cam
paign. If he wants to promise to pup
port the nominee of the republican
party and he can name that indi
vidual so long as it is not himself
then the republicans will cooperate
with the progressives.
Hut if the threat sent to the re
publican leaders today that under
r.o circumstances will he support
Justice Hughes if the latter is the
republican nominee, is in good faith
and expresses the actual feelings of
the colonel, then there will be no
peace negotiations, the republicans
will nominate the justice and de
mand that he sacrifice himself to his
party and make the fight regardless
of consequences.
This was the position taken just as
the republican convention assembled
here today.
"I will bolt if you name Hughes."
is Hoosevelt's attitude, according to
definite word conveyed to the repub
lican leaders.
The republican leaders immediate
ly lined up against any conference
ommittee. They made It plain that
that there would be no use of nam
ing It unless the progressive party
leaders were willing to assure them
that the situation would be discussed
dispassionately and no effort made tc
insist on Iioosevelt.
If the progressive chiefs show
that they can control their "wild
horses" and are willing to agree on
mother candidate who actually is a
republican, then such a conference
committee may yet be named.
Arr flacking Hughe.
Put as the convention assembled
i' was plain that the republican
leaders had little hope that this
would be done and they were devot
ing all their energy to influence
Justice Hughes from eliminating
himself as a candidate. While no
one tried to speak for the justice
cttieially, the men who say that he
must lead the republican fight were
calling attention to statements that
he made while governor of New
York, that a man should be willing
to niake sacrifices for a party that
had honored him.
George W. Perkins expressed sur
prise when he heard that word had
tome that Iioosevelt would run on a
third ticket if Hughes were nomi
nated by the republicans.
"Unless that is an official an
nouncement." said Perkins, "it can
be flatly denied."
T. It. Is IHufliiur.
Some republicans declared that
Iioosevelt "was blurring again" and
asserted they would stand pat.
Gov. Whitman met the news that
Roosevelt intended running on a
third ticket If Hughes is nominated
by th republicans with a laugh.
That's no surprise." he said. "I
e xpected it."
"Will it make any change in your
plans?" he was asked.
"Not any," was the answer.
"Do you think that it will cause
Justice Hushes to decline the repub-
!l;can nomination if it is tendered to
him?" he was then asked.
"I can't say as to that," he an
swered, "but I don't think so."

will be nominated by the republi
cans probably on the second ballot

said Mr. Perkins when asked con
cerning" the proposal to name con

to select a candidate on whom both

SEN. LODGE IS NAMED.
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 7. Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge of
Massachusetts, was elected ch airman of the republican committee
on resolutions by a unanimous vote at the convening of the execu
tive committee this afternoon. Charles F. Scott of Kansas, was
elected secretary.
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 7. The republican convention
got under way here this morning at 11 :27 and at 1 :26 adjourned
until 11 o'clock tomorrow.
Most of the session was devoted to the keynote speech by Sen.
Warren G. Harding of Ohio. Temporary officers were appointed
and the convention will be ready to get dawn to business tomor
row morning.
Its routine of organization was carried out with a precision in
no way disturbed by the fact that not even the leaders were pre
pared to forecast whether it was to end in a "fight or a frolic.'
It was a republican convention, the leaders said, and under no
circumstances would control of it be surrendered to an other party.
"Peace with regularity, or war even though it means defeat,"
was the war slogan of the Old Guard. And they had "counted
noses" and had the votes to keep control, even if they ct ;ild not
unite them on any single candidate.
The convention was called to or
der at 11:27 by Chairman Charles
D. Hilles of the republican national
committee. At that hour nearly
every delegate wr.:- in his seat while
the galleries were filled to suffo
cation. The first slogan of the convention
came from the lips of National
Chairman C. I). Hilles who after the
convention had become an orderly
gathering made the following an
nouncement :
Sim 'America."
"Paraphrasing a remark of the
late Pi rs't McKinley, this is a year
when politics :s patriotism and pa
triotism is politics. Therefore the
audience will rise and sin:.' two
verses1 of 'America.' "
Following the singing Chairman
Hilles introduced the Rev. John
Timothy Stone. I). I), of Chi' ago,
who offered the opening prayer ;;.s
follows:
"Most Holy and Ktern.il Ood. we
bow before Thee with reverent
hearts and thoughtful minds. Thou
art our God; Thou art th' God of
all nations; Thou art the Cod of o ir
nation. Thou hast be-n th Cod of
our fathers. Thou hast been our
(Jod in times of j.ear amid the per
plexities of war. Thou hast riven
to us freedom, liberty, purpose and
propriety.
"Although the immediate interest..,
which now control oir leathering
together have reference to our own
national issues, we would not forget
the warring, suffering nations of the
earth. We pray Tr.ee to bring them
speedily, if it be Thy holy will, to
terms of peace and conditions of ad
justment. "We bow before Thee, and. paus
ing 'juictly, ask Thv bles.-mtr Isfort!
entering upon the deliberation's of
this convention. As Thou dost order
the affairs of men. s( frame the do
ings of this great body. S.ivt fr:n

.May the men of Thy hoir-e ;,e (, ;r

truth and righteousness.
"Direct, suggest, control thi- day.
All we design or do. or say;
That all our powtrs with all th. ir
might.
In Thy full glory mav unite.
We ask all in the r.an.e of our com
mon Master and Lord.
Amen."
Chairman Hilles then announced
that the next proceeding would be
the taking of the photograph by
the official photo-raphr, and there
was a general laugh as tlie man in
charge of the flash called for th
dek-'ates to face the cameras. The
big flashlight was exploded at 1 1 : ::T. !
