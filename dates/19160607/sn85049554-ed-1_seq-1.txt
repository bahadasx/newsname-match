leaders who counted Roosevelt out
four years ago had it in their
power to nominate Hughes on any

Knd progressive-national conventhJtis—
the first at? the Coliseum and the sec

today with the growing hope of final
harmony and the final passing of the
bitter feud born here four years ago.
Republicans declared that as soon
as committees are appointed to secure
harmony, plans for a dual nomination
will be drawn if possible and hopes
were expressed for harmony between
the "old guard' 'and progressives.
Today's work on the floor of the

All Want Harmony.
Today there was considerable talk
of peace plans, altho It was said noth
ing definite had .been decided upon.
Both sides sedmed desirous of bring
,"ng about .harmony If possible.
Among progressive leaders the plan
most favored, according to Walter
Brown, of Ohio, was a motion for a
peace committee formally offered the
convention" by George "W. 'Perkins,
thus placing the whole question in the
hands of the delegates.
With the members of the'committee
on resolutions already selected by their
delegations, it is becoming evident that
the urork of the committee as a whole
will be one of elimination rather than
Nf construction. Almost every man on
the committee Is loaded with planks of
his own making, and many of them
have taken sare of extra declarations
for outside friends who feel called up
on to outline the policy of the party
for the next four, years.

Over night- conferences failed to de-1
velop any definite plan of agreement on,
a candidate who would receive the un- I
divided support of both factions, but
talk of peace was in the air.
A proposal to have both conventions
appoint conference committees was
talked on both sides and the prediction
was made that ultimately th^re would
be harmonious action in some way.
Convention leaders themselves were
so engrossed in petty details of get
ting under way and taking care of del
egations from, their own states that
they had little time for serious discus
sion of candidates and realized that the
question had. moved to the conventions
themselves.
No Nominations Till Friday.
Republican leaders felt today that
their convention might not proceed to
nominations before Friday and even
later it prospects of- harmony devel
oped at the last moment.
The favorite sons were considering
the question of holding their own sup
porters if the nomination were delayed.
Most of the republicans have agreed
that the candidate will be named Fri
day, but some predict it will be Satur
day and others feel that the prospects
of peace negotiations at the eleventh
hour might continue the convention to
next week.
If there was any change at all over
night it showed an increase of strength
for Hughes. 'Managers of favorite sons

party to prevent the selection of Sen

held an informal conference with the
senator on the platform.

The attempt of the German's to keep
Senator Lodge off the platform com

to put up Senator Borah of.Idaho be

Plan of Radicals to Force Roosevelt

Auditorium Hall, Chicago. June 7.—
At 12 o'clock about half of the progres

dent the opening of the convention
would be late.
Delegates and guests arrived slowly.
The band began to play at 11 but there
were few to be entertained and the
musicians gave up without completing
their number.
Only a few of the states attempted
anything like massed entry.
Reports that there might be an in
sistent demand for the immediate nom
ination of Roosevelt as a notice to the
republicans that they could not be ig
nored, were virtually squelched by a
statement issued by George W. Parkins,
the chief spokesman for ihe party who
declared the progressives were meet
ing in a conciliatory spirit and would not
act precipitately, while the possibility
of an agreement with the republicans
remained. His statement sdld:
"At the moment of the opening of
the conventions, the progressives are
very well satisfied witli the atmosphere
surrounding them and believe vtiat
proper spirit has been cre-?.t?3 from
which the result so desirable in the best
interests of the cbuntry may be finally

Roosevelt will be nominated today.
"There is not a chance," he replied.

national committee, at 12:27 p. ni.. The
demonstration was tremendous.

including "When Teddy Comes March

At noon the delegates were still fillnK'

"Teddy is not afraid, of the f^ain,"
they scouted, "get out and march." So
in a body they pushed to the streets.
They marched and sang "Tcddv, You're
a Bear."
While the delegations filed in the
band played a medley' of songs, in
cluding the progressive birth song.
"Onward," Christian Soldiers."
The delegations exchanged state yells
In a hubbub of confusion.
They stood and cheered as the band
played "My Old Kentucky Home."
Governor Johnson, of California,

the convention and sent word he would
not be a party to discord.

At 12:27 the convention was called to
order by Chairman 'Murdock. He rapped
for several minutes before quiet was
obtained. The delegates cheered and
shouted. The Kansas delegation had
caused an uproar by yelling "Rocksalt.

gave him three cheers.

Colonel Roosevelt Quiet But Attitude
Is Threatening,
Oyster Bay. X. Y.. June 7. While
Colonel Roosevelt refrained from mak
ing any public statement disclosing his
attitude toward the political situation
in Chicago, it is well known here that
he is opposed to the nomination of
Hughes and it is believed that If
Hughes Is nominated Colonel Roose
velt will himself become a candidate.
Colonel Roosevelt, as is well under
stood, Is not at all satisfied with Jus
tice Hughes' so-called "flag speech"
which he regarsd as a "Fourth of July
address." In the words of his follow
ers here the colonel regards the speech
as evidence of further "pussyfooting."
Colonel Roosevelt seemed to be feel
ing better today in regard to his own
chance of being nominated.
His followers look for a broadside
from him in a day or two which Is
expected to eliminate Hughes.

From allied ..and neutral countries,
the dominions, colonies and dependen

In the dominions legislatures ad

dead leader. The news was received
in the South African assembly dur

Invited By Russia.
Earl Kitchener was going to Russia
at the request of the Russian govern
ment. He intended to land at Arch
angel and visit Petrograd and probably
go to the Russian front. His mission
had chiefly to do with the supply of mu
nitions for Russia.
The earl expected to he back In Lon
don for the reopening or parliament
on June 20.
An official statement says that Earl
Kitchener was to have discussed im
portant military and financial questions
with Emperor Nicholas.
Accompanying Earl Kitchener as his
staff were Hugh James O'Belrne, for-'
mer councilor of the British embassy
at Petrograd. and former minister at
Sofia: O. A. Fitzgerald. Earl Kitchener's
private military secretary: Brigadier
General Ellershaw and Sir Frederick
Donaldson. There also were a number
of minor army officers aboard.
Naval officers express the opinion
that the cruiser Hampshire must hare

The Hampshire, while an old boat

for patrol and blockade work. It car

Katser Praises Battle Fleet.
Berlin, June 7.—In the complete ac

men of the fleet, at Wllhelmshaven,
yesterday, which was published here
today, the emperor Is quoted as saying
that the great naval battle-off Jutland
has destroyed Great Britain's naval
supremacy of the seas.
"When the great war came," the em
peror said, "envious enemies attacked
the fatherland. The army, by desper
ate fighting against superior foes,
slowly conquered them one after an
other. But the fleet waited In vain
for a fight.
"Repeated effort to bring the foe out
proved useless until last week the gi
gantic fleet of Albion, ruler .of the seas
since Trafalgar was fought, 100 years
ago, appeared In the open surrounded
with nimbus. Instantly our fleet en
gaged the superior fleet and with what
result? The English fleet was beaten.
The first blow was dealt the English
fleet, whose tyrannical supremacy was

New York, June 7.—The college Is not
Intended as place to teach military
iraintng and the modern curriculum
does not provide room enough for such
instruction in a way which would ap
ply In a crisis, Henry S. Pritchett, pres
ident of the Carnegie Foundation For
the Advancement of Teaching, declared
today at the New York University com
mencement exercises.
Mr. Pritchett said further that "tho
contribution of the land grant colleg©'
to the preparation of a reserve of cit
izen soldiery was practically negllg*
Ible,"
He ridiculed tho "assumption of our
legislators that military training could
be mado a by-product of a college
course."
Mr. Pritchett declared that many of
the land grant colleges made possible
by the Merrill act of 18-62 continue the
required military training only "to ob
tain the constitutional grant" that
others give only the "minimum of mili
tary training," and that the "individual
student in many cases seeks to escape
military duties with as scant a per
formance as possible."
•Mr. Pritchett said colleges were
meant for other things than military
training.
