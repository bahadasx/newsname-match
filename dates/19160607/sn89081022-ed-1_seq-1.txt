Annual Commencement Exer
cises Take Place at Park
Auditorium.
The High School Commencement
last Friday evening was an auspicious
event in the history of the schools of
Willmar. Forty-three boys and girls
received high school diplomas, and
seventeen received Normal Training
diplomas accompanied with duly ac
credited first grade rural teachers'
certificates.
The weather conditions were ideal
and the park auditorium was filled
with people. The stage was decorated
with the class colors, purple and
white. Members of the Board of Edu
cation, Prof. Foster, Miss Jenness and
Dr. O. J. Johnson occupied seats at
the rear of the stage. The march was
played at the piano by Miss Rade
macher, and the graduates came slow
ly down the two main aisles of the
building and took their places on the
stage where chairs were arranged for
them in three rows.
The High School Chorus sang Kip
ling's Recessional under the direction
of Miss James. Rev. E. R. Todd, rec
tor of St. Luke's church, pronounced
the invocation. Miss Laura Hoglund,
the salutatorian, gave her oration,
"The Moral Factors in Life," which
appears in full on page ten of this
issue of the Willmar Tribune. Her
delivery was splendid.
The commencement speaker was
Dr. O. J. Johnson, president of Gus
tavus Adolphus College. He spoke on
"The Unfinished Task" and his pro
found and powerful address made a
deep impression on his hearers. Dr.
Johnson has won a high place for
himself among the educators of Min
nesota since assuming the presidency
of the G. A. C, and those who heard
him Friday night will fully understand
the reason for his success.
The High School Chorus gave a
double number—"The Robbers," by
JBaillie-Parker, and "June," by Lowell
Schnecker.
Ruth Sletten, the valedictorian, then
delivered her oration, "Public Play
grounds," a plea for wholesome recre
ation with special application to Will
mar. It is published in full else
where. Miss Sletten has reason to be
proud, indeed, for winning the highest
honors in so splendid a class as that
of 1916.
The diplomas were presented by V.
|E. Lawson, president of the Board of
Education. The Normal graduates, in
'addition to their diplomas, received
/first grade teachers' certificates for
I the common schools, duly attested by
-.the County Superintendent of Schools.
Scholarships were awarded to Miss
Ruth Sletten from Macalaster, Carle
ton, Gust&vus Adolphus and St. Olaf's
Colleges, as having the best standings
in the class, and scholarships from
the same institutions were awarded
to Walter Larson as the boy having
A Surprise Party.
A gathering of the friends of Mr.
and Mrs. Halvor Thorson, who recent
ly lost their residence and all their
personal effects by fire at Norway
Lake, took place at the East Norway
Lake church basement Sunday eve
ning, when they were handed a purse
of nearly $400. The fire was a severe
blow to the Thorsons, and Sunday's
event was an evidence of the practi
cal sympathy of their neighbors. The
Thorsons have lived with the Melvin
Swenson family since the fire. Steps
have been taken to rebuild the house.

The following resolution was of
fered by Mr. S. B. Qvale and upon
motion duly adopted by the Board:
Be It Resolved by the Board of Edu
cation of the City of Willmar, Minne
sota, That, Whereas we, as a Board
of Education believe, that the exam
ple set by the soldiers of. the Grand
Army of the Republic, our nation's
heroes, in decorating the graves of
their departed comrades on Memorial
day, the 30th day of May of each year,
a beautiful, laudable and patriotic
custom, And Whereas, it seems in
cumbent on this Board to do all with
in its power to deliver uninfpaired to
a future age such records as the past
may have intrusted to its care, that
it may enkindle pure love and patrio
tism in the hearts of the young, to that
native land, which though it has in
deed gained a proud seat among the
nations, has still the same need of
protection from their virtues, that it
once had from their father's swords,
And, Whereas, the ranks of the sold
iers of the Grand Army of the Re
public are fast being cut down, and
that ere a very few years, they will
all have retired from the scenes they
have honored, it behooves us as a
Board of Education at this time, be
fore the last one shall have been laid
to rest, to make some effort and adopt
some plan so as to continue to carry
on this most beautiful custom of ten
derly scattering flowers on the graves
of the departed ones on every mem
orial day. And, Whereas we, as a
Board of Education believe it a part
of the duty of the teachers in our pub
lic schools to inculcate and infuse in
to the hearts of our young, true love
and patriotism for our glorious coun
try, so that there may be warmth as
well as radiance for our nation, and
to teach and tell of the early days,
toils and perils, bravely and cheer
fully born, and to impress them on
our children, who amid the luxurious
indulgences of a great and prosperous
land can scarcely conceive the hard
ships and dangers by which its free
dom and greatness was wrought out.
And, Whereas we, as a Board of Edu
cation believe that the event of Mem
orial day might be so embalmed and
brought forward year by year, as to
perpetuate the blessings which have
flowed from it. Now, Therefore, Be
It Resolved, that from and after this
date it shall be the privilege of the
Senior Class of the 'High School of
the City of Willmar under the direc
tion of the City Superintendent of
Schools, assisted by the teachers and
children of the public schools of our
city, and others, on every Memorial
day, May 30th of each year, to take
charge of and arrange for patriotic ex
ercises on that day, and to visit the
different cemeteries in our city, there
to decorate and scatter flowers on the
soldiers' graves, and while living and
with us, to have along as honored
guests on every such occasion all the
Grand Army soldiers in our city that
may be able and willing to participate
in the exercises, and while blossom to
blossom is added and scattered over
the last resting places of our nation's
heroes, let us not forget other friends
and relatives. And, Be It Further Re
solved, that the Clerk of this Board
be requested to procure from the
Grand Army Post in this city, the
names of all the soldiers dead and
their burying places within the city,
and the names and data of all the sol
diers now living within the city, and
that proper records and data be kept
of the soldiers living and dead."

Cora Berkness and Miss Bertha Ram
sett had tendered their resignations.
Said resignations were, upon motion,
duly made and carried, accepted.
Motion was duly made, seconded
and carried that the Board approve
of the awarding of diplomas to the
graduates from the high school and
normal department for 1916.
Upon motion duly made, seconded

SPICER YOUNG MEN
HAVE NARROW ESCAPE
Ford Car Jumps State Road Last
Monday Afternoon Near Spicer.
Roy Cederstrom and William Gutz
ske of Spicer were the victims of an
auto accident on the state road last
Monday afternoon about four-thirty o'
clock. The former is the proprietor
of a confectionery store at Spicer and
was in need of a freezer of ice cream.
Accompanied by Gutzske he jumped
into his Ford runabout and headed for
this city. Evidently the boys were in
a hurry, as, after they rounded the
corner near the Iver Peterson place,
and came down the grade on a straight
stretch, Cederstrom lost control of
the steering gear with the result the
car jumped the road. Just what gyra
tions it went thru will probably never
be known, but when it started out, the
machine was naturally headed for
Willmar, and after cutting capers, and
landing in the ditch, four feet on the
right hand side of the road, it was
turned about, and facing home again.
The occupants of the car were
thrown out. Cederstrom landing about
twenty-five feet on one side, and Gutz
ske a like distance on the other. The
most miraculous part of the whole
thing is that neither had a scratch to
show for his experience, and outside
of being a little jarred were none the
worse for the affair. They landed in
water that was up to their necks, and
had they been stunned, the thing
might have turned out a lot more ser
iously than it did.
Assistance was secured and after
several hours of labor, the car was
rescued from a watery grave and tak
en back to the garage at Spicer for
repairs.

HOL8TEIN BREEDERS HAVE
BIG SESSION AT EDGEWATER
Speeches, Demonstrations, Lunch and
Social Chat Features Last Sat
urday Afternoon.
The meeting of the Kandiyohi Coun
ty Holstein-Friesian Breeders' Asso
ciation at Edgewater, David Swen
son's farm on north shore of Long
Lake, last Saturday afternoon was a
pleasant and profitable gathering for
all the participants. Twenty-one au
tos brought people from far and near,
as far south as Svea and east from
Litchfield. There were about a hun
dred and twenty-five in attendance.
Robert Thompson presided over the
meeting, which was held on the lawn.
The main speaker was Prof. A. J. Mc
Guire, and he discussed the main
characteristics of the "black and
whites," in detail, and dwelt upon the
desirable traits that breeders should
aim at producing. The size of the
Holstein makes it the most practical
"dual-purpose" cow, therefore the size
should be kept up. Quantity of milk
should not be sacrificed in order to
produce a higher test. It is better to
get a large flow of milk testing 3.5
than a smaller quantity testing 4.0.
The great necessity for testing cows
in order to know what they are do
ing was emphasized, and the speaker
insisted that the testing should be
kept up continuously. While the sev
en-day test was better than none, it
might be misleading, and therefore he
urged testing the year around. The
speaker was given close attention
and was applauded. Prof. Rodegeb
was next called on, and gave informa
tion about the county organization and
what it was attempting to do. John
A. Nelson of Litchfield was called on
and reviewed some of his experiences.
The years he devoted at raising so
called dual-purpose cattle he con
sidered wasted, and he made little
progress until he went back again to
the dairy breed. Much harm had
been done by institute workers who
had advocated dual-purpose cattle for
dairymen. He urged a more general
showing of animals at the county fair.
He said there were herds enough in
the county to make a grand showing,
if the breeders would only exhibit
them. Mr. Robert Thompson made
some apt remarks, and finally called
on E. B. Heller, the jolly creamery
man from Spicer, who is a walking
encyclopedia on dairy matters, and
has in the past owned some of the
record animals of the Holstein breed.
During the speaking session lemon
ade was served by the hostess to all
present and at the close everyone was
invited into the house to partake of
lunch. This seemed- a very opportune
time for a shower of rain, which how
ever, cleared away in time Jtor. the vis
it to the dairy barn. OTgeira^er has
one of the finest dairy barns in the
county, equipped as it is with the
modern improvements. The interior
of the barn showed the touch of the
mother, Mrs.'John Swenson, who be-meeting
lieves that a good dairy cow is the
noblest creature God has given man.
She had decorated the barn with li
lacs and strewn the cement floors with
evergreen twigs, for the occasion.
David Swenson has one of the finest
Holstein herds in the county. The
cows, full-blood and grades, number
thirty-two. There were "black and
whites" from the small calves to the
large head of the herd, and each was
used as a text by Mr. McGuire as he
went thru the barn with the visitors.
Many questions were asked and the
traits of the breed were discussed
from every angle. Finally the cows
were let into the barn, and the milk
ing machine which has been used
successfully for two years, began its
evening's work. This was the first
time that many of those present had
seen a milking machine in operation.
The visitors departed to their homes
all pleased with the manner in which
they had spent the afternoon and theed
hospitality they had enjoyed at the
hands of Mr. and Mrs. David Swen
son.

SEMINARY COMMENCEMENT
LAST SATURDAY EVENING
Thirty-Fourth Annual Glass to
csins Diplomas at Willmar
Seminary,
Rev. C. Davick, of Fargo, N. D., de
livered the address of the evening,
using as his subject, "The Secret of
a Successful Life." "The secret of a
successful life," the speaker said "is
a faithful application of all gifts giv
en to you. Set your ideal high, and
strive to make use of all the resourc
es at your command."
A hymn by the audience and the in
vocation by Rev. Davick opened the
exercises. Marion Fossum rendered a
selection on the piano, after which
Arthur Wilcken delivered the salut
atory address, which will be found in
its entirety in another column. A vo
cal solo by Miss Berrum followed,
after which Erwin Nelson talked on
"Preparedness," and contrary to gen
eral expectations he did not speak on
the preparedness of this nation for
war, but on the preparedness of the
individual to go out and fight the bat
tles of life. He handled the subject
in a most convincing manner. After
a song by the girls' glee club, Rev.
Davick addressed the class. This was
followed by a selection by the School
Chorus. Miss Nellie Olin followed
with the history of the class and Miss
Ella Samingson told of a dream in
which she had seen the future of her
class mates. Prof. N. B. Swalin then
gave a delightful violin selection, and
Miss Helga C. Berg delivered the
