Leaders of the two parties, who

HARDING MAKES PLEA
FOR A PARTY REUNION
Aiiociarsn
CHICAGO. June 7?With a plea
for party reunion, for reconsocratlon
rather than recrimination. United
States Sonutor Warren G Harding,
of Ohio, in his address as temporary
chairman opened the Republican national
convention here today. Asserting
that the country was "wearied
atresh by a disappointing and distressing
Democratic odtnlnstratlon."
und was calling for Republican relief
the speaker, before undertaking to
discuss political issues, appealed to
the delegates to forget the differences
which divided the party in
1912.
Referring to the administration's
f<*TPlgn policy in the European war
Senator Harding declared that it
had snoken with more rhetoric than
rcRolutlon. Mexican negotiations he
described an the greatest fiasco in
American foreign relations. He paid
tribute to Americanism of foreign
birth with brief reference to the fewj
zealots who would Impugn the nation's
neutrality and urged a fraternity
of American republics under the
Monroe doctrine. Advocating adequate
national defense he charged the
Democratic parly with having Interrupted
Republican naval construction
and he criticised the army re-organIzatlon
bill Ho also attacked the
administration shipping bill, the effort
made to extend Independence to
the Philippines, and made u plea for
a return to the protective tariff.
"We did not do very well for
making for harmony the last time
we met." the chairman said In his
appeal for harmony. "The country
has regretted, let us forget and
make amends to our country ^Ve did
not >11v!(ln nvnr fimHntti. *?t 1 r?Hn

nationnl policy. Wo split n\cr moth
otis of party procedure and preferred
personalities. I^et us forget the dif
forenoes. and find now Inspiration and
new compensation In an united endeavor
to restore the country.
"Republican principles are in a
vast majority in this country?when
the banners of harmony nre unfurled
We have witnessed the comeback of
our party In various states. We
have seen the re-enlistment of those
who believe in Republican doctrines,
and victory has followed and rejoicing
has attended. No apolocy has
been asked, no foreswearing required.
This Is not the time for reeriml.
nation, it is the day of roconsoeratlon.
"Rrdedlcatlng here and now the
Republican party to the progress
and glory of the republic, let us bury
party preflxeM with the administrailon
which our differences put In
power. I do not believe there is a
really reactionary Republican bearing
credentlnla to this convention.
If there Is, he will depart, after our
deliberations, solely and proudly a
Republican, with heart aglow with
the party spirit of 10K>. And the
welcome delegate who emphasizes
it is progresslvelsm. is expected to do
his part in making our party a reflex
of the best thought and best intent
of sincere committal to the uplift
and progress of the American people,
thereby strengthening party purpose
instead of magnifying; individual belief.
nnd he. too. will find now rejoicing
In being a Ttepublican. No
party can endure which is not repressive."
The world at war. preparedness
and America's foreign relations served
as the basis for the senator's first
discussion of the issues. The enormity
of the war in Europe, the tidal
wave of distress and disaster, new
wonders and new hindrances In commerce
and utterly changed economic
conditions, and 'these have attended
embarrassment in American foreign
relations." he said, "as difficult as
those which the Individual citizen experiences
whose every neighbor la
Involved In deadly quarrel."
"Everything is abnoraml except
the depleted condition of the federal
treaaury. which Is characteristic of
Democratic control." he said, "and
1 the facility of the administration for
writing varied notea without effective
notice." Amid these conditions.
America, he asserted, had been sin

gled out for leadership among the
neutral powers, "but the admlnlstra.
tlon at Wushllngton spoke with more
rhetoric than resolution, and we
came to realize that the warring powers
soon came to know that the official
American voice lacked the
volume of determined expression
that once demanded international
heed, and wo lacked the strength
and confidence in our own defense."
In the discussion of foreign relations
the temporary chairman made
particular reference to Americanism,
to the course with Mexico and with
Europe, beginning with Americanism
he traced it hack to Independence
days when there were Amer'cans
from (Jrent Itrltain. from Germany.
from France and southeren
Europe who made a common cause.
Since that time, he said. America's
gates hud swung Inward to the foreign-horn
and "they are an Inseparable
and important and valued
part of our American citizenship.
" w"""!" "i any ??iiKin
who violate our neutrality do not,
and cannot. Impugn tho loyalty of
the American patriotism of that
great body which adds to the swelling
chorus of My Country, 'tis of
Thee, Sweet I.and of Liberty.' "
Expressing reluctance to speak of
the division of American sentiment
re] a tint: to foreign affairs. Senator
Harding discussed briefly the Mexican
problem. "It must he said, for
the truth's sake and clear understanding.
we have hungered In vain
for that vifllnch'ng Xmcrlcanlsri at
Washington which Is needed to exalt
the Amerlenti soul." he declared.
"There IJ no geographle modlflcatlon
of A t nor I can rights They are the
same In Mexico that they are on the
high sens, they are the same In Europe
that they are In Asia, and are
sacred everywhere, and the American
pplrlt demands their fullest protection
"Whatever the ultimate solution
may bo. history will write Mexico a?

the greatest fiasco in our foreign rela
Hons. I'ncertninty. instability,
Mexican contempt and waning self-respect
will be recorded In every chapter.
and tho pitiable story of sacrificed
American lives and the destruction
of lawfully held American property
will emphasize tho mistaken policy of

miserably meddled. In the nam?
of peace that same administration encouraged

real American xpondituro required
only the voice of authority demanding
protection to American rlgh>s.
The unbiased critic will recite that
the Democratic administration first
coddled Villa as a patriot, then chased
him as a bandit."
Respecting America's course with
Kurope the temporary chairman asserted
that no political party could
draw a "variable chart for our ship of
tate amid Europe's warring ambitions."
"Justice." he continued, "points
the way through the safe channel of
neutrality. There are dangers, seeming
or real, looming on every Ride,
but we should feel Recure along the
course marked by International law
and our own conscientious convictions
of American rights. 'Straight
