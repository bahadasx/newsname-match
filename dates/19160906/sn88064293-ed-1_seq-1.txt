Prayer Meeting Tonight. ■
Rev. Wier announces prayer
meeting services to be held in
the Methodist church tonight,
TOPSY TURVY.
A pretty and well-played j
comedy was enacted at the!
Evangeline Tuesday night by j
Berwick talent in their rendi-j
tion of Topsy Turvy. or The
Deacon's Courtship. A fairly j
well-filled house witnessed the I
performance which was given |
by t ht? Berwick Epvvorth League
under the auspices of the Lad
ies' Presbyterian Aid of Morgan
City. The financial success of
the play has not been reported, j
but the entertainment was aj
splendid success from a stand-1
point of presentation.
The parts for the comedy j
were well cast and the story of i
the play was well worked out.
The character parts enacted by
Miss Henrietta Brown. Miss
Ouida Byron, Mr. Alvin Gashia
and Mr. Harold Jacobs were
played to perfection and the
make-ups were in strict keeping
with the characters represent
ed. The juvenile and straight
lead parts were taken by Mrs.
S. H. Coleman, Miss Thelma
Thorgeson, Mr. Dewey Brown
and Mr. Clayton Coleman who
were highly entertaining in
their respective parts.
The story of the play was
built around a pranking young
couple. Topsy Turvy and Frank
Golden, a miserly deacon and
his persistent wooer, played by
Miss Ouida Byron and Mr. Al
vin Gashia. Lord Clarence, an
Englishman, much desired by
May Golden, but finally captur
ed by Topsy Turvy. were
represented ably by Mr.
Dewey Brown and Miss
Thelma Thorgeson. Mrs. Clar
endon, who was unable to con
fine the vim and vivacity of her
daughter. Topsy Turvy, and her
nephew. Frank Golden, was
played exceedingly well by Miss
Henrietta Brown. Frank Golden,
the mischievious college boy,
home on a vacation, was a hit
as portrayed bv Mr. Coleman
Clayton. Ned. a negro part, play
er! by Mr. Harold Jacobs, kept
♦ he audience in an uproar.
Special musical numbers were
j contributed to the successful
• entertainment by Mr. C. J. Har
rell of Morgan City, and by Miss
Jessie Hanson of Berwick with
j to their respective classes
