A RIOGHICTTIOD 10RROR.
In the last issue of The Courier, in
giving the indications as they ap
peared to us as probable final results
in Hie first primary, we made an er
ror as lo the race for House of Rep
resentatives, stating that a second
race was probable between W. P. Ma
son and Jas. H. Brown. The name ol'
J. R. Orr should have appeared in
stead of that of Mr. (Brown. We re
gret the error, and it was an error
entirely of oversight on our part.
We endeavor always to give an ac
curate forecast each election year
in our regular edition Wednesday
morning following the election Tues
day, and with figures for more than
?0 candidaf.es to be cast up and veri
fied as well as the unofficial figures
will permit, we bad no small task be
fore us. With a number of precincts
still to be heard from when we quit
work at 3 o'clock Wednesday morn
ing, and with not a few inaccuracies
In the figures as received by phone to
bo corrected if it were found possible,
the figures at hand at 3 o'clock
showed a difference of 21 votes as
between Mr. Brown and Mr. Orr, and
tho difference in favor of ?Mr. Brown.
Additional precincts were heard from,
however, and a number of corrections
made in certain returns phoned to us,
the general result changing the posi
tion of these two gentlemen. In the
final rush of making up the forecast,
these changes were overlooked and
the "indications" were given incor
rectly in this ono instance. Our state
ment of probable second races was
correct with this one except ion, and
we regret exceedingly having given
out this one incorrect "indication."
though the totals given In our tabu
lated report showed the correct
standing of the candidates.
We never claim this first tabulated
statement of returns to be correct. It
ie impossible to get an absolutely cor
rect tabulation In so short Hmo.
But the figures as given by us Wed
nesday morning were so nearly accu
rate OK to necessitate comparatively
few changes In getting into shape the
official tabulation, which will be
found in full, both for State and
county Officers, with the official dec
laration of results, In another por
tion ol' this Issue of The Courier.
NATION-WIDE STRIKE IS OFF.
Congress Passes Mensuro that ut
Lenst Postpones Tie-up.
Washington, Sept. 3.-The Adam
son eight-hour-day bill, exacted from
Congress last week by tile railroad
brotherhoods as tito price of calling
oft the nation-wide strike ordered
for to-niorrow, was signed by Presi
dent Wilson to-day in his private
car at tho Union Station, where lie
stopped on his way from Shadow
Lake, X. .1.. lo Hodgenville, Ky.
That, there may be no question as to
Hie legality of the measure as a re
sult of it having been signed on Sun
day, the President will allix his sig
nature again upon Iiis return to
Washington next Tuesdny.
How long peace shall reign as a
result of the hill, apparently, is de
pendent upon developments in the
proposed move to test the constitu
tionality of the act. Should (he rail
ronds take no action, but await the
beginning of an investigation of the
workings of the eight-hour day by
the special oom mission for which the
measure provides, the brotherhoods
will remain inactive. The em
ployees' leaders declare, however;
that should tho law bo held uncon
stitutional, and the railroads at
tempt to restore the ten-hour day
on their lines, a strike will follow
promptly.
Brotherhood Hoads Silent.
Brotherhood heads, in a circular
letter to their members, to-day made
no comment on the measure as pass
ed. Tiley merely pointed out that it
would not become effective until
next January 1, and that many
things might occur between now and
then which would change materially
any suggestions or comment they
might mnke.
None of the brotherhood leaders
witnessed the signing of the 'bill.
They had expected, according to ten
tative arrang?ments made hy Secre
tary Wilson last night, to be pres
ent, but the President decided to at
tend to tho business at the railroad
station, and newspaper correspond
ents gave them their first informa
tion about lt. The four pens used
by the President in signing the bill
-ono for each syllable of his name
-will be presented to the four bro
therhood heads, A. 13. Garrctson,
W. G. Lee, W. S. Carter and AV. <S.
Stone, after being used for re-sign
ing the bill Tuesday.
No Ct|*emony Attended Signing.
No ceremony attended the sign
ing to-day. It originally had been
planned that the President should
go to the White House, but this was
changed, and instead Rudolph Fors
ter, assistant secretary to the Presi
dent, took the bill to the train. Near
the car window a group of trainmen,
in their overalls, paused In their
work long enough to watch the Pres
ident write his name. An engineer,
passing on a yard engine, celebrated
tho occasion with several prolonged
blasts of his whistle.
While at the station the President
also signed several commissions and
executive papers and sent Secretary
Tumulty to the home of Majority
Lender Kern, of the Senate, to urge
that the Senate pass thc Webb bill,
passed yesterday by the 'House, de
signed to permit American firms to
utilize common selling agencies
abroad without violating the Sher
man anti-trust law.
Strike First Planned for August 20.
lt dovolojied to-dny that the bro
therhoods before hoing summoned to
Wnshington hy President Wilson
three weeks ago, had agreed to call a
strike effective August 20. The or
ders they drafted were used when
the strike finally was set for Labor
Day. 'After having been printed in
preparation for the proposed strike
on August 20, they were locked In a
vault in New York. Decision a week
ago last Saturday to order a strike
the following day, when tho major
ity of the committee of 640 wore
leaving for their homes, was follow
ed hy a hasty trip to New York by
two representatives of the brother
hood. Tho strike date, September
4, was filled in with a rubber stamp,
but thc original date of the call, Au
gust 14, was not changed.
Many Opposed Strike,
Among thoso who departed from
Washington early to-day was a dele
gatton of tho Order of Hallway Con
doctors from tho Northwest, who
carno hore yesterday to protest with
'Mr. Cnrretson against a strike. They
arrived about the time the Senate

State Board of Charities and Correc
tions as to J bo financial responsibil
ity of applicants for scholarships
was canvassed.
Dr. D. B. (Johnson, president of
Winthrop College, said that only 55
vacant scholarship's were to be lilied

of Charities and Corrections, he
stated, found that approximately l?
per cent of the applicants were ineli
gible because of sufficient funds to
pay tuition.
Winthrop's president said that
there were 1,600 applications for en

commodate only OHO, refusals were
made to 660 of them. Moreover, a
large portion of those refused ma
triculation wore, insufficiently pre

Texas Farmers Indignant.
Fort Worth, Texas, Sept. .'I.-H.
N. Pope, president of tho Texas Far
mers' Union, lins given out the fol
lowing statement, commenting on
the eight-hour law passed by Con
gress Saturday:
"The people of this nation have,
during tho past week, passod
through tho most humiliating expe
rience this government bas ever en
dured, A few labor union lenders
have stood at tho portals of Con
gress demanding that govern piont
give them a ransom or they would
wreck society. This nation, instead
of meeting the. situation bravely, has
delivered the goods in fear and
t rem hiing,
"Our American Congress has stood
within the shadow of the Goddess o?
Justice and voted an increase In
wages to four hundred thousand
trainmen, who aro tho highest paid
laborers In the world, and never nt
any time mentioned tho three hun
dred and fifty thousand trackmen
who aro perhaps tho poorest paid
workmen in tho world, and who
must subsist almost wholly upon tho
crumbs that the trainmen leave upon
tho tejde.
"When cotton was selling for six
cents per pound two years ago and
poverty stalked over the Southland,
causing a greater financial loss to
the Southern plowmen than the free
ing of slaves, Congress confessed in
ability to copo with tho situation and
stopped asido, letting this awful bur
den fall upon the backs of the till
ers of tho soil. The organized plow
men pleaded with Congress for re
lief, but were told that it would not
bo constitutional for government to
undertake to fix tho price of cotton
or to advance money on cotton In
storage, and that Congress was a
slow-moving body and could not
meet emergencies."
