RUSE OF A BAD MAN.
Trick by Which He Turned the Table
on Sheriff Bill Nye.
To nearly every one the name of BUI
Nye brings the picture of a genial, fua
loving man whoso jokes -were once fa
mous all over the country, but to those
who lived in Wyoming some thirty
years ago Sheriff BUI Nye of Laramlo
county means something else too.
Sheriff Nye was alsolutely fearless.
Flo was resolute, decisive, quick to act
and tireless in pursuing offenders. lie
fuiled to get bis man on only one occa
sion, and that failure was due to tho
tenderness of heart that was always
part of ills character.
Nye started out once after a typical
bad man who had shot or stabbed
some one and quickly learned that ho
had fled to the mountains. Summon
ing a deputy, the sheriff sprang on his
horse, and the two started off. After
riding nearly 20c) miles into the wilder
ness they learned that their man was
hiding in an abandoned miner's cabin.
whit tier he had brought his young wife.
Soon after darkness fell Nye quietly
rode up to the cabin and dismounted
before the door. He sent Ids deputy
round to guurd the rear of the little
Shack. Then Nye threw open the door
and dashed inside, with his revolver
cocked an ready for instant action.
Tlie criminal was asleep on tho bed,
and Ids wife, who sat close by, wns
Stroking his forehead. Nye covered
them both wit', bis gun and told them
to throw up their bands.
"I've got yOS" be said grimly. "Now
you get up quietly and come along.
The? lady can stay hero if she chooses."
The Lad man admitted that the gamo
wns up and began to roll his blanket
Into a bundle. "Never mind that."
said Nye. "We've got plenty of blan
kets In the place you're going to." Tho
desperado then asked if ho couldn't
say goodby to his wife.
I reckon it's tho last time I'll ever
see her," he continued. "You've got
the goods on me this time, sheriff, nnd
I reckon I'll swing for it"
He appeared so cast down that Nye's
warm heart prompted him to grant tho
request. "All right," ho said. "I'll
give you two minutes."
Tlie criminal rose from the bed. Tho
next Instant I hose tightly rolled blan
kets came whirling through the air and
struck Nve in the face so heavily that
he reeled back against the wall. Be
fore lie could recover bin balance and
throw off the blankets the criminal
had dashed out of the cat In. leaied on
Nye's pony and W8S galloping down a
mountain trail In the darkness.
Of course Nye's deputy Ofnia rushrng
round from the rear of the cabin and
started In pursuit, but the bnel man
was never heard from afterward.
Youth's Companion.
The First Cradle.
Tho earliest mention in literature of
cradle's is in the Biblical account of
Moses' iittle ark of bulrushes. Put
there are iu the British museum some
clay tablets found some years ago on
tho site of ancient Nineveh which, ac
cording to- nrchacologlsts, make it
quite clcjt that somewhere about
4,000 years before the Christian era
there was another Infant hero exposed
In n little nrk of bulrushes. Thus tho
cradle that was found by Pharaoh's
daughter MOo B. C. was comparatively
modern.
It is certain that cradles were first
used as a means of protecting babies
from the attacks of wild animnls by
suspending them from the boughs of
trees. London Clobe.

Carlyle and Hia Pipe.
Carlyle smoked often and complained
much of dyspepsia. A friend once ven
tured to sogcest that his smoking might
perhaps Injure and depress him. ''Yes,"
Carlyle said, "and tho doctors told BM

again and was very meeserable still.
