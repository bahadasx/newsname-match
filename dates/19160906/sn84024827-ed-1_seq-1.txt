Sweeping Demands.
The four formal demands as quoted j
as follows:

American interests seem at first
glance to be more deeply involved
than in any event in the Far East,
since Japan's famous ultimatum to
China 'of May, 191.1.
Japan seeks more than ever before,
demanding political rights which are
interpreted in Peking as destroying
China's sovereignty in that whole
enormous section.
Special attention is attracted here
to the demands for a formal at'ology I

But it is the political articles which

interpretation, and might cut directly
across the American policy of the in

possibilities 'of violation of the open

Epstein says the Zeppelins had

"They are so constructed." said Ep-
stein, "that they can rise higher than

TOKIO, Sept. 5 Elbert H. Gary,
chairman of the board of directors of
the I'nited States Steel Corporation,
was the guest of honor at a banquet
here tonight that was attended hy
men high in political life and business.
Mr. Gary referred to statements which
he said were occasionally published
in the I'nited States and perhaps in
Japan, with regard t'J the possibility
of a serious conflict between the two
j countries at some time in the future,
! He declared emphatically that all the
business men in the I'nited States did
.not anticipate any trouble between the
I'nited States and Japan.
"They would stubbornly oppose any
suggestion of a t'ontlict with all the
i force and influence at their command."
said Mr. Gary. "This undoubtedly Is
the prevailing and unchanging senti
ment of citizens throughout America."
The speaker told of the desire of the
I I'nited States to retain the confidence
land friendship of Japan in the w'orld
development.
Mr. Gary insisted that every ques
tion arising between the two countries
could be finally settled if submitted
to representative bodies of citizens of
Japan and the I'nited States whose
wills the respective governments
would be bound To respect. He urged
business men to unite to combat the
influence of demagagues and others
who were actuated by selfish designs.
"Japan and America." concluded Mr.
Gary, "have the desire and the brain
to work together while honorably, and

WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. The administration emergency revenue bill, de
signed to raise $205,000,000 annually from taxes on inheritances and war muni
tions and from increases in the income tax. creating a tariiT commission, estab
lishing a protective tariff on dyestuffs; providing for protection of American
firms from "dumping" at the end of the war. and giving the President authority
to take drastic retaliatory steps against allied interference with American
trade was passed by the Senate, 42 to 16 late tonight.
Five Republican senators, Cummins, Kenyon, I-afolette, Norris and Clapp
voted for the bill. There were no Democratic nays.
Drastic amendments to the bill striking at the allied blacklisting of
American merchants, and against American commerce, interference with
American mails and embargoes on American trade were incorporated in the
bill to arm the President with retaliatory weapons. These amendments have
created consternation among diplomatic representatives of the allied powers
in Washington, who assert they would constitute a non-intercourse act and
lean to commercial warfare.

night and today from all parts of Son

from the Cananea district, bringing
reports that unrest over the monetary
situation had grown to sucn an ex

tions of Governor Adolfo de la Huer

of Carranza's latest issue of currency

The army is dissatisfied because of I
being paid in the Carranza money and j
desertions are decimating the ranKs.
Arrivals from Cananea say if de la
Huerta forces the employers to cease
paying in silver and to pay in Car-
ranza "bllimoinues." a general strike
which will result in rioting, is feared,
For that reason all the more timid
Mexicans are leaving the district.
It was learned from a reliable
