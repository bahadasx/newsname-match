MAY BE
THIS FALL
COUNCIL UNANIMOUS ON SPECIAL
ELECTION
Light Committee Reports That Cor
rectlons and Changes in Franchise
as Now Drafted Should Be Made,
and AkK for Another Week to Do
This Ordinance Calling Election
May Re Ready Next Monday.
The question of a franchise for the
Keno Power company to sell and dis
tribute electricity in Klamath Falls
will be voted on by the people at an
election that very probably will be
held this fall. This was decided
last evening when the light committee
of the council that the matter be ra
the council that the matter be re
ferred to the people.
Following is the report of the com cem
mittee: The light committee reports on the
proposed Keno Power company fran
chise as follews:
We have investigated the power
plant and property of the company,
ajidereadvlsed .of their plans as to
future development, etc. We would
recommend that the question be sub
mitted to a vote of the people at a
special election, after some sections
were added and a few changes are
made to the ordinance. We therefore
ask for another week to make the cor
rections, at which time an ordinance
can be introduced calling for an elec
tion. R. J. Sheets, O. D. Mathews, I.
R. Struble, committee.
After the report was read. Council
man A. D. Miller moved Its acceptance
and concurrence by the council In the
recommendations of the committee.
The motion passed unanimously.
The light committee and Mayor C.
B. Crlsler visited the plant of the
Keno Power company last Monday,
and thoroughly Inspected It. After
doing this the committee felt that per
mitting another power company to
come into Klamtah Falls was such a
serious matter that the council should
not take upon itself the decision of
the matter.
An ordinance calling a special elec
tion may be submitted to the council
next Monday. It is not known what
date the ordinance will set, although
the light committee may decide to
have tho people vote on this question
at tho same time the railroad bond
issue Is voted on, thereby avoiding an
other election.
