Washington, Sept. ,r>. Measures of
reprisal against the Entente Allies
that threaten serious international
eomplicatioaa passed the .Senate to day
with the full approval of the State
I?enartment. The President is em
powercd, in two amendments to the
revenue bill, to retaliate against the
>o-cu!led blacklist of the Brtti-h and
French governments and against inter
Jerences with the mails.
Diplomatic circles, particularly those
favorable to the Fntente. were deeply
stirrrd when it became known Presi?
dent Wilson had given his approval to
these measures and that Secretary
I.?tn: ing had been consulted as to their
languege. It ia held the measures give
the President the power to uae illegal
weapons against the Allies. The ex
ercisr o' this power to its full extent,
it is declared, would lead to a long and
bitter trade war.
There was virtually no opposition to
the pa?sag* of the amendments in the
Senate. No rollcalls were taken. l)em
ocrats and Republieans alike acqui
esced in what some diplomats char
acterize as a "preeiection twisting of
the lion's tail."
Refrj.-e* ( learance to Shipa.
Th* two amendments were proposed
by Baaatora Thoma*. of Colorado. and
Phelan, of California. Oaa provides
that the President may withhold clear
ance from vaasela that disenminate
i.gainst any Ameriean citizen or firm
or particular description of trarhc, and
mav withhold clearance from one or
more vessels of any nation that re
s'ricts the commerce of Ameriean ships
or citizens.
This mean* net only that Great Brit?
ain and France may be struek at be?
cause of their blackhsts and their
blockade measures, but that repnsals
may be conducted agamst ahippintc
compames that earry eerUin commod
Itiaa, as, for example, munitions, in
preference to others
The Phelan amendment, regarded as
?.ven more danijerous Ifl ita posaibili
tiea enables the President to deny the
u.-n'of the I'nited States mails, tale
grapha, cahles, wireless and exprei.s
aervica to British an.l French aubjecta
or firms if their governments per.sist in
any niei.sures icstricting Ameriean

If the union I'eels that any of these contracts

Fitzgerald Awalts Mayor.
With the position of the company
thus firmly announeed. the only beam
of hope that a strike would be averted
lay in the statement last night of
William R. Fitzjrerald, leader of the
rarmen's union that unless he is
overruled there arill be no walk-out
on the Interborough or surface lines
until after Mayor Mitche! has had an
opportunity to seek a pea<*eful ad
justment of the contract question.
Fitzgerald, who has the power to
order a strike on these lines, at the.
same time announeed that the em?
ployes of the New York Railwaya
Company, whosc aid Interborough
empbyes last week asked, would to
day vote on the question of a possiblo
sympathctir strike. The Interbor?
