The vote was 239 to 56 with five
members not voting present.
Official House Vote.
The official vote' in the House on
the final passage of the amended Adam
son eight-hour day bill was:
Ayes 239; nays, 5G; present, 5. Two
Democrats voted against the bill and
70 Republicans, and the one Socialist
voted for it. None of the Progressives
voted.
The original text of the provision
was as follows:
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the Unit
ed States of America in Congress as
sembled.
Section 1. That beginning Decem
ber 1. 1916, eight hours shall in con
tracts for labor and service be deem

-b1,000, or imprisoned not to ex

The Adam'son bill as passed in the
House by a vote of 239 to 56, with mi
nor amendments, Is the same measure
which the brotherhood leaders official
ly declared would constitute a "satis
factory settlement" and pre :ent the
strike. The amendments, added to
conform to a draft framed by the Sen
ate Interstate Commerce Committee
would fix the effective date at January
1 instead of December 1, 1916, and ex
empt railroads less than 100 mIles long
and electric street and interurban
lines.
It was after a day of hot debate
that the House passed the bill, under
a special rule brought in when Re
publican Leader Mann objected to. its
consideration. Less than half of the
Republicans followed their floor leader
in the opposition and when the final
vote came 70 of them lined up with
the majority, only 56 voted against the
measure. Just two Democrats. Repre
sentatives Steele of Pennsylvania, and
Black of Texas, stood out against the
bill and Representative London of
New York. Socialist, voted for It.
Red tape was elimmnated as far as
possible to -rush the measu're over to
the Senate which, after several hours
of lively discussion over a bill report.
ed by its Interstate Commerce Com
mittee, had recessed until 8 o'clock.
At the outset of the night session
Senator Newlands sought and obtain
ed unanimous consent to put aside the
Senate bill and take up the one sent
over from the House, thereby paying
the way for quick final action without
parliamentary formalities that othee
wise would be necessary. Then Sena
tor Underwood brought up the issue
over which the Senate is divided by
proposing as an amendment the rate
fixing provision of the discarded Sen
ate bill.
Three Hours' Debate.
Over~this amendment debate waged
for three hours. Senators Newlands
and Underwood advocating it, and Sen
ator Cu::mins making a long speech
criticising the whole proceeding. Most
of the Senators had little to say and
in the cloak room there were strong
intimations that in the end the House
bill would go through without change.
For a vghile there was talk, of a~n all

night session,. but ezrly in the evenin;
word was passed that an agreemen
to adjourn and vote at a certain hou
Saturday would come before the die
cussion had gone very far.
While the House was at work, th
three brotherhood heads at the invi
tation of Democratic Leader Kitchi
occupied the Ways and Means Com
mittee room near the entrance to th
House floor and were in constant com
sultation with the labor spokesmen i
the House.' They were insistent tha

wage-fixing amendments put forwari
during the debate. Representative Ca
sey of Pennsylvania was constantly o:

ing at Colorado. who conducted thei
fight on the floor. When the vote wa
taken they obviously were pleased
Their failure to make statements wa
a tribute to fear that anything the:
might say would have an undesirable
effect upon deliberations in th
senate.
The Senate committee bill was the
Adamson measure with the same
amendments adopted by the house
and an added section empowering the
Interstate Commerce Commission t

employes at the end of the propose(

When the senate began its nigh
session the galleries were throngec
to capacity, many railroad official!
and representatives of the brother
hoods being in the audience.
In asking unanimous consent tc
lay aside the senate bill and take uI
the one sent over from the house
Senator Newlands criticised Congres
for not responding to the President'
demand for legislation which would
serve as a protection against a future
labor crisis, and declared members
feared to face the issue because o:
the political campaign.
Senator Thomas also said that Con
gress -and not the President was evad
ing the responsibility of meeting
great emergency without fear and ii
a way to make its action permanen
in character.
Senator Cummins made a lon
speech against the house bill. H(
said the country was confronted witV
appalling disaster and he was nol
prepared to say that senators shoult
not yield some of their convictions t<
avert though it was impossible fol
him to believe the problem should be
solved in the way proposed. He de
elared in his opinion the amendmeni
of Senator Underwood would absolute

he doubted if it would be satisfactor
to the brotherhood leaders.

BIG PROGRAMFOR
PALMETTO TROOPS
NATIONAL GUARD WILL STAY ON
BORDER UNTIL NOVEMBER
1ST AT LEAST.
NEWS FROM BORDER CAMP
A Weekly Letter, Prepared Especially
For Our Readers, From the South
Carolina Guardsmen Encamped at
Fort Bliss, Texas.
In Camp with the South Carolina
Brigade, in the El Paso Patrol District.
-That the South Carolina National
Guard will be kept on the border at
least until November 1 is revealed
t through the program of field training
r which has been issued from the head
- quarters of the El Paso district in ac- a
cordance with the provisions of gen
e eral orders, No. 17, of the war de
partment. The program mapped out r
runs through the 31st of October and n
what is intended beyond that date is 9
e not known. Whether there will be
further training of the troops or
o whether they will be sent back to
their homes is something which only
a the war department and the military t
r chieftains know.
A progressive order of instructions fi
is being followed with the idea of
reaching a fair degree of training by
the 1st of November. Instructions com- p
menced with the small units and pro- u
r gress to the larger units culminating I
in the field manoeuvres of all the ii
troops in divisions and in the district
during the latter part of Novembe.
The instruction began with . t:
training of companies and this was b
e during the month of August. Because a
the South Carolina regiments did not a
reach the border until some days ago I
they will necessarily have to compress
the training into a smaller space of
time but .s they received considerable a
1 work by companies during the time a
they were at Styx they are in a good C
way to take up the work at this point a
and carry it through according to the 2
program and without losing in effici
5 ency.
The T .lmetto regiments began com
pany drills Monday morning and thisb
will continue through the 31st inst.
This will be followed by the training
by battalions from September 1 to Sep
tember 15, inclusive, and by training
by regiments from September 16 to
I September 25, inclusive. Q
From September 26 to September
81 the trcops will be trained by brig
ades. n
In Field Manoeuvres.
The month of October 1 to October
31 will be devoted to field work and
manoeuvres and this will be by the C
largest bodies, such as divisions and y
all the troops in this district. It i j
thought that these manoeuvres will b, a
held at some point where there is suf- t
finient ground for the handling of the r
thousands of soldiers and just where t
this will be is not known yet to the t
public.
During the dress parade no swords
are used. but the officers wear their tl
-pistols.
Lieut. Ortmann of the German Fusi- 5
leers is- collecting a baseball team I
from the Second to go up against those I
from the other National Guard regi- 2
ments. A baseball league has been c
formed composed of the National a
Guard regiments from all the states
encamped in this district and Lieiut.
Ortmann is determined to put out a u
team which will prove a winner. The: ti
Second has some fine baseball stars f
and they will more than hold their own t
on any diamond and against all c
esers.a
Col. Springs has telegraphed Gov. o
Manning recommending the appoint- 9
ment of George M1. Benet as lieuten
ant of the Columbia Light infantry.
Mr. Benet was formerly lieutenant of n
this company but was rejected on phy- o
sical examination. However he has g
since qualified and Col. Springs rec-; 9
ommends his reinsttement. C
The '-eport that President Wilson ti
may review the troops encamped in 4
El Paso and along the border has C
caused a good deal of interest tlhrough- 1
out the c-amps of the National Guards
men and regulars. In no place would;
the visit of the president be more wel- S
comned than among the South Caro
linians, for they are not only all good~
soldiers and would -welcome at any a
tieavisit and review bytheir cam- p
mander-/n-c-hief. but it happens that di
they are all Democrats and followers
of the man in the White House.

IN "HICKORY BANK"
PIONEER HAD SAFE PLACE FOR
HIS STORE OF GOLD.
What Might Be Considered Accident
Was the Means of Revealing What
Meant Fortune to Jim Apple
gate and His Mother.
One day in March, 1858, Jim Apple
gate, aged twelve, accompanied his fa
ther to the bank of a little Indiana
town, where Mr. Applegate drew out
the $35,000 for which he had sold his j
farm, in 250 20-dollar gold pieces.
"It will pay you to keep an eye on
that pile of gold," cautioned the
banker.
"Tomorrow I'll put it in a hickory
hank," said Mr. Applegate.
The banker smiled if he caught
the point, but Jim was puzzled.
:"What is a hickory bank, pa?" he
asked.
'It's a pretty safe sort of bank, son,
when you're traveling," was all his fa
tiler would say.
At the hardware store Mr. Applegate
bought an inch-and-three-quarters
auger with an extra long shaft, :nd
then they went home. After that night
Jim saw the money no more. Mr. Ap
plegate kept his business affairs to
himself, and neither Jim nor his moth
er knew where it was.
The Applegate family was one of
ten families that traveled in prairie
wagons that year from Indiana to Ore
gon over the famous Oregon trail. The
2,000-mile journey was less dangerous
than it lad been 15 years before, but
there were still perils, the most serious
of which was that from attacks by hos
tile Icelians.
For that reason there was something
of a military arrangement to the march
even of these ten wagons, and each
night the wagons were drawn up in a
circle and the yoke and chains of each
wagon were used to connect it with
that In front. Within this circular forti
fication the camp fires were built.
On the eightieth day out they were
attacked by a party of young Indians,
who thought to take advantage of the
smallness of the party. The skirmish
was brief, but bloody and tragic enough
for that small band of emigrants. They
drove off the redskins, but lost two of
their own number. One of the men
who were killed was Mr. Applegate.
Mrs. Applegate left her husband, and
Jim, his father, inder the fresh-heaped
mound upon the plain, and there also
they left the secret of the "hickory
bank." They ransacked the wagon
from top to bottom; they looked'
through all of Mr. Applegate's private
papers and notebooks; but they could
not find the money, nor did the papers
contain any note or memorandum of
its hiding place.
All that Jim and his mother had was
a little over a hundred dollars in
money, five cows, the ox team they
were driving, the wagon and the house
hold effects that it contained. .
Westward from Fort Hall the road
was rough and mountainous. One day,
as they were descending the rockiest
and roughest portion, the Applegate
wagon was in the rear. It was three
o'clock in the afternoon. Jim's mother
was driving, and he was walking be
hind, occasionally throwing a stone at
one of the loose cows or calves that
ersisted in loitering. There were
lbrupt breaks in the surface two and
three feet high. The rear wheels would
slide over these miniature precipices
andi hit the lower level with a sudden
ness and violence that shook the whole
wagon and rattled the pans and ket
tIes off their hooks.
M tcr one of these "jump-offs," some
wht higher than usual, Jim saw that
the hind wheels of the wagon were
turning drunkenly. They were lean
g in at the top and out at the bottom~.
His mother drove on, unawvare that
anything was wrong, and he ran to
catch up with her. A shining gold
pic~e in the middle of the road caught
his eye. Atalanta-like, he stopped to
pick it up. Fifteen feet farther on he
found another. They began to appear
tikly, and he gathered them up as lie
went. Before he reached the wagon
his mother had driven over another
of the "jump-offs," und the tops of the
wheels leaned in so far that they began
to r'ub against the sides of the wagon
bed. M~rs. Applegate stopped the oxen
a~d leaned out to see what was th
Jim came up and stooped down be
side the rear axle. A yellow pile of
$20 gold pieces lay there, and other
pieces were rolling out of an auger
hole that ran like thle bore of a ritie
through the center of the splintered
hi'kry column of the broken axle.
