Burton, ex-mayor of Chickasha, whut
is known as tho old yellow barn on
Eighth street between Chickasha and
Choctaw avenues 'was completely de
stroyed by fire at 1:110 this morning.
Seldom in the annals of fires in
Cliickusha has such a hot and such a
quick one occurred and that the ad
joining building were saved from de
struction reflects great, credit upon
Chief Gattls and his corps of fire
fighters. The alarm was given by a
couple of boys who rode to the fire
station on bicycles and by the time
the department reached the scene the
building to the north was threatened'
with destruction. Four leads of hose
were, immediately laid and, It being
impossible to save the barn, the at
tention of the fire fighters was direct
ed to the neighboring structures. At
6ne time the roof of tho house on the
corner of Eighth and Choctaw, occu
pied by Bill Slavin, caught fire but
this was exinguished without loss.
So intense was the beat that tho
paving in fron( of the building was
burned to a crisp and the volume of
smoke which poured out to the hav-
ens left the impression of a burning
oil well.
The barn at the time was empty
and vacant. The loss is estimated at
between $4,000 and $5,000 by Mr. Bur
ton and was not covered by insurance.
For some time the building had net
been occupied but had been used for
cattle sales. It was built by Mr. Bur
ton eight years ago. '".,
As a result .of the fire a neighboring
messenger containing the cable' of the
Pioneer Telephone company was burn
ed, putting out of commission 15fi tele
phones in the north part of town.
It is believed that boys playing with
matches were responsible for the
blaze.
SMALL BLAZE
, The firing of murli light artillery
and the lurid hue which the heavens
took on at ten o'clock last night led
many people to believe that a gerat
conflagration was in progress. The
commotion was caused by the total
loss of a three roomed bouse at 22:1
Washington street, owned and occu
pied by a negro named Henry Walton.
Building and contents, to the value of
about $'100, were destroyed but were
covered by insurance! The occupants
were asleep when the fire broke out
which caused a delay in sounding the
alarm and the adjoining building, own
ed by the same man, was scorched be
fore the department arrived.

in acceding to her request. She then
playfully poured a thin (stream of wa
ter on them. This they resented and
told her that a repetition of tho of
fense would lead to their slapping her
face. Then tho father took a hand in
the quarrel and told the youngsters

this time the boys were thoroughly
aroused from th' ir slumbers and pick

ing several blows with their fists on
the head, laying the old man up for
some days.
Bob Castlenian, who formerly resid
ed in that vicinity, was called for and
placed the boys under arrest. The
case ended as. above stated.
