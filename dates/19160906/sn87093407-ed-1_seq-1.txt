SEATTLE, WASH., WEDNESDAY. SEPT. 6. 1916,
CONGRESSMAN HUMPHREY and his unscrupulous mouthpieces,
the standpat papers, have again been caught deliberately lying.
The Congressional Record nails their slander. They lied about U.
S. Senator Poindexter's vote on a tariff on lumber and shingles.
Humphrey, with malicious intent—for he must have known he was lying—declared
that Senator Poindexter voted against a tariff on lumber and shingles. His standpat
papers took up the cry.
And Humphrey knew very well —for the Congressional Record is accessible to him
that not only did Senator Poindexter vote FOR a tariff on lumber and shingles, but
that he himself (Poindexter) offered an amendment to the Underwood law to that
effect, and that Senator Jones of Washington made a speech on September 6, 1913,
supporting Senator Poindexter's amendment.
The question of a tariff on shingles and lumber came up to a vote three times during the discussion of
the Underwood law. Twice it came up on September 2—on amendments offered by Sen. Jones. Poin
dexter voted WITH Jonea on both of thoae amendments. On the first amendment, Sen. Jones secured 21
votes against 44, and on the second he got 22 votes against 42.
The second amendment provided a tariff of 25 cents a thousand on shingles.
On September 6, 1913, four days later, Sen. Poindexter introduced his amendment, providing for
a tariff of $1.25 per thousand feet on lumber and 25 cents a thousand on shingles. This amendment
was especially aimed against British Columbia. Sen. Poindexter made a speech in behalf of the
amendment- and so did Sen Jones. Sen. Jones' speech in behalf of Poindexter's tariff on lumber and
shingles is found on page 4336 of the Congressional Record for September 6, 1913.
The vote on this amendment is found on page 4337—and Sen. Jones and Poindexter voted alike—
FOR Poindexter's amendment FOR a tariff on lumber and shingles.
Yet, in the face of these official facts, Humphrey, malicious and reckless in his desperation, con
tinues to mouth his slander.

LIIHDIN SPEEDS UP
PRODE OF PAYROLLS
Handwriting experts will be employed by Proaecu
tor Lundin to go thru the mass of cancelled warrants
and payrolls of King county's South road district*, in
search of extensive graft evidence, he announced Wednes
day.
Deputy Prosecutor Carmody Wednesday requested
County Auditor Phelps to co-operate by assembling all
data as quickly as possible, so that the prosecuting attor>
ney's office could rush the investigation.
Clerks in the auditor's office have been gathering
such papers as will be inspected, for several days.
"It may not be possible to lay
our flutter on any one person right
off the bat." said Prosecutor l.uu
dtn Wednesday "But we intend to
opeed up this thins and get to the
bottom of It If there Is extensive
eraft In the road districts, we want
to put a stop to It."
The payrolls In one district for
.tune list 19 laborers, and at least
three of the signatures of what ore
believed to be dummies are radic
ally different from what are sup
posed to be the same signatures on
the July payrolls.
But clerks In the auditor's office
say it will be next to Impossible to
check back and find out how ex
tensive grafting may have been. If
dummies are proved to have been
entered on the payrolls.
They say that the road bosses
hire a number of men and are not
efficiently checked by the supervis
ors.
The district supervisors sign the
monthly payrolls, they say, but usu
ally take the word of the road
bosses.
Two of the three county commis
sioners approve the rolls, after they
have been signed by the supervis
ors. but this Is tegarded merely as
a matter of form.
Unless the road bosses *n<l la
borers under them are honest, It
was pointed out, graft may have
been flourishing under cover for
years.
