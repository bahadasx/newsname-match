COUHTRY LIFE MEETING
Developed Much of Interest to These
Who Were In Attendance.
The first Country Life Institute, un
der the auspices of the Presbyterian
church, held in the Baptist church on
Friday And Saturday was a great suc
cess. While some 01 those who had been
scheduled as speakers were prevented
from being present on account ot sick
ness or other causes, the program was
tull ot interest from first to last.
Dr. James H. Miller, of Lebanon,
who was the first speaker of the meet
ing, outlined the purpose of The Coun
try Life Movemnet, giving something
of its origin and progress to the pres
ent time, as well as the relation which
the Presbyterian church sustains to
this movement.
While the work was undertaken here
under the supervision of this church, it
is not intended that the movement
shall be confined to the labors of any
particular church. Some very interest
ing experiences ot the work already
undertaken in other places were given
showing the remarkable growth se
cured in return tor the amount ex
pended in the work.
The purpose and plans were discuss
ed freely by a number of those present
and many opportunities of taking up
such work were revealed in the fact
presented in this discussion.
Rev. Frank L. Miller of Princeton
Seminary, who has been conducting a
religious survey m Cumberland county
duri..g tbe summer gave a brief ac
count of the facts he had discovered in
these investigations These facts cov
ered density of population in compar
ison wits other counties and the state
as a whole, kind ot crops rawed, with
results in comparison with the state,
amount of religious work being carried
on in Sabbath schools, churches, etc.,
conditions of church buildings, school
houses and other buildings of the coun
try, together with results obtained
through these agencies for the better
ment ot country conditions. Taken as
a whole the report has considerable
valuable information for any one who
is interest? ;d m obtaining a fiist hand
knowledge of conditions in Cumber
land county.
In the afternoon the "Future of the
Country Church" was presented by
Dr. Miller, followed by discussions on
the part of many of those present.
Much interesting material for study
and many suggestions which could be
carried out in making the church of the
future fulfill the mission of the Master
in making an institution of service,
were presented.
Following this was an address by Dr.
W. M. A. Ganfield, President ot Cen
ter College, Danville, Kentucky. His
theme was "The Qualities That Make
a City or the Country Worth Living
in." He took for the basis of his dis
cussion the qualities that James Whit
comb Kliey would admire in "An Old
Sweetheart of Mine," and showed that
the qualities that make a country or
tbe city lovable are similar. These
are qualities thai can be devloped and
the responsibility ot developing them
is the responsibility that should lie
heavily upon the hearts ot anyone in
terested in making a better country.
NIGHT SERVICE.
J he time of the evening service was
given up entirely to Dr. Ganfield, who
gave one ot the most powerful addres
ses ever given in this country. His
theme was "Our Country's Future"
and in developing it he left food for
many a day's thought. He took up
first a deMnition of civilization, ana
portrayed her as a maiden who first
came to dwell in Chaldean. There she
was content to stay for many years,
bo long as the character of the Chal
dean nation was such that she could
make it her home. Then she moved
westward to Greece and for many years
made that her happy home. , dwelling
there until Greece had produced more
men ot note than any nation before or
Bince. Hut where now is the glory ot
Greece? She is but a "spilled gravy
spot on the tablecloth of civilization."
Again the maiden moved westward and
rested for a time at Rome and while
she dwelt with them Rome then was
"the mistress of the world." But
again civilization moved westward,
dwelling for a time in the peninsula
of Spain and then taking her flight
across the great Atlantic to the Amer
ican shores. Here she has seemed con
tent to dwell, but bow long, many we
claim her companionship? What made
her leave the nations of the East?
Will she be content to stay with us un
less we show a higher development ot
character than have these nations of
the East? Here is food for tnougbt.
Are we progressing in our develop
ment or character or are we failing?
Is the young man of 16 to 20 in our
American cities, a safer specimen
with whom to trust our liberties than
tbe young man of a like age seventy
five years ago? If he is not wbat is
the reason for it? Are we safe guard
ing those qualities that make for civi
lization or are we permitting our man
of the future to develop into a moral
weakling? Where does the responsi
bility lie? If it is ours do we accept
it? Will we take the necessary step
forward to make that character possi
ble in our manhood that can be safely
entrusted with our destinies? The lec-

ture from beginning to end .was a poem
of eloquence and thought and those
present sat spellbound for the hour and
a quarter of tbe lecture.
The small attendance was rather a
sad commentary en tbe ability of our
townspeople to appreciate things of
culture and especially on chose teach
ers, who were given the day from their
schools to at end the institute, but who
preferred a picture show to such a
feast of thor it. The Country Life
work has son problem before it, if it
succeeds in h lying the teaching force
to a plane 01 resunsibility for the up
bonding of the country community.
Dr. Gantieid is & man ot national
reputation una u say that one has net
him and heard him ia an index of abil
ity within itself. It is hoped that he
may be again secured for a lecture
here.
The Saturday morning session was
taken up in the discussion of the sub
ject of play and its relation to com
munity betterment. Many helpful
things were brought out in these dis
cussions. Dr. Lewis then gave an address on
"Sanitation and Wbat Can Be Done to
Secure Better Results in Sanitation for
Our Country," which was very help
ful. Before adjoining it was moved
that a committee be appointed to con
fer with the Country Life workers in
securing another institute for the near
future. This committee is as follows :
Geo. P. Burnett, C. E. Snodgrass and
and Dr. V. L. .Lewis, ot Crossville;
Prof. Wheeler ot Pleasant Hill; Fred
Hamby of Mayland ; Robert Potter,
Grassy Cove; Mrs. H. Jay Dunbar,
Ozone; J. S. Cline, Crab Orchard;
Mary Spencer, Creston, and Sam Nel
son, Uenesis. A meeting of the com
mittee will be called in the near fu
ture.
F. M
Governor Hooper gave oat the fol
lowing statement in regard to Con
gressman McKellar's refusal to meet
him in joint debate:
"It is a weak candidacy that cannot
look the opposition squarely in the
eye. It is a vulnerable cause that can
not endure the light and heat of the
open arena.
"This is the first time in the history
of the democratic organization in Ten
nessee that its candidate for a great
state office has felt impelled to evade
a hand-to-hand conflict and betake him
self to the trenches. Mr. McKellar
evidently prefers long-range artillery
to cold steel and the hand grenade.
"The truth is that no hand-picked
candidate of the discredited Cruwp
machine, backed by the other city ma
chines of Tennessee, can stand up be
fore the. people and fight.
"The little minority of 50,000 voters
that nominated McKellar lack a long
shot of constituting the democracy of
Tennessee, much less a majority of the
general electorate.
"The pretense that McKellar wanted
a joint canvass, but that his campaign
committee would not consent, is broad
ly ludicrous.
"In tact, Mr. McKellar announced
in the Memphis newspapers a week
before the committee acted that he
would open his single-barreled cam
paign at Gallatin. This was several
days before the Democratic campaign
committee was even elected. This
would indicate that Mr. McKellar bad
already decided to ask his campaign
wmr r-i-- iam
plunging rashly into a joint canvass'
with the republican nominee.
"The people of all parties will be
disappointed in McKellar's back-down.
A joint debate is by far the fairest
and most satisfactory method ot cam
paigning ever adopted by candidates
for membership in either body of tbe
national congress. It is conducive to
the conservative and accurate presen
tation of facts and arguments by can
didates, and it enables the people to
arrive at a just estimate of the com
parative merits ot the men who seek
their suffrage.
'When 1 open my campaign which
will be soon, the people will know that
my utterances in regard to men and
measures will be such as 1 did not fear
to offer where my opponent had the
opportunity to make answer "

Samuel Cline Passed Away Sundy 12:50
P. M. at Advanced Age ot 88.
Samuel Cline died Sunday at 12:60
p. m., after a lingering illness of sev
eral weeks, due to advanced age. Had
he survived until October 9 he would '
have been 88 years of age Tne final
end did not come unexpectedly as he
had gradually been failing for several
weeks and it was due to the clean and
abstemuous life he had always lived
that he was spared to his friends so
long. He realized that the end was
near and was anxious to pass to the
great beyond.
Most of the members of his family
were at the bedside when the final
summons came. He had been tenderly
nursed for weeks and every thing done
that could be to make his slowly ebbing
vitality sustain him with the least pos
sible suffering.
The funeral services were conducted
at the house by Judge C. E. Snodgrass,
wbo spoke in the highest terms of
that life with which he had been so in
timately familiar tor many years. He
voiced the words of all who knew the
deceased when he stated that while he
had known Mr. Cline from boyhood he
had never known him to do anything
which he had need to keep from the
world and that he had never beard any
person say an unkind or discreditable
thing of Mr. Cline. After a very
feeling and touching tribute paid to
the deceased and a reading of tbe New
Church burial service, the Crossville
Masonic Lodge, of which he was a
charter member, took charge ot the re
mains and laid tbe body to rest in the
cemetery here with the honors of the
enter that he teved so nracb, and which
over 85 years.
All that the kindness of neighbors
could du was done to assist the family
in caring for and ministering to every
want and need of the deceased. Tbe
casket was covered with a profusion of
flowers as a sweet token ot love and
esteem of many friends. Two sons,
Geo. W. and S. C. Cline, and one
daughter, Mrs. Eva C. Bishop, reside
here, whlie one son, Superintendent J.
S. Cline, resides at Crab Orchard. One
daughter, Mrs. S. L. Brown, Athens,
was present accompanied by her hus
band, Judge S. C Brown. Numerous
grand children were in attendance at
the funeral as was a large concourse of
neighbors and friends.
The wife ot bis young manhood and
mature life, Mary Morris Cline, pre
ceded him to the grave seven years
ago, she having died September 12,
TI 909.
He was fur 17 years Commissioner
of the Poor for this county and resign
ed the position because of tailing
strength. For some ten years or more
he had charge of the repair and con
struction of the bridges of this county.
He was a carpenter by calling yet he
conducted both a farm and a store sue
cessfully. As a business man he was
farseeing and of broad vision and gen
erous in mind. During his life he built
several of the best residences in the
county. He was always ot a broad and
progressive nature that was deeply in
terested in those things that make for
better living and more cheerful and
happy lives in every way. As a citizen
he was admired and respected by all
who knew him and those who knew him
best loved him and admired his quiet
and dignified character most.

ters in hand tor starting tbe work,
nothing was done of consequence Mon
day. Tuesday morning the teaching
force met and began the assignment of
lessons and arranging for classes in
the several departments.
Some confusion was caused by Prof.
Miller, of Knoxvilln, notifying the
school board a few days before schoel
would open that he would be unable to
take charge ot the school as had been
arranged. He suggested the name of
Prof. R. O. Binford, who also made
application for tbe place and filed cer
tain credentials. The High School
board was called together by Chairman
G. A. Haley and after some discussion
it was decided to employ Prof. Binford
and he was notified by wire.
