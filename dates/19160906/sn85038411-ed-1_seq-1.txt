For Test in Court

Property Owners Effected by
Connecting Viaduct to Join
in Rattle
Members of the City Council who
are explaining their grant to a private
corporation to erect an overhead
bridge on Seventh street, on the score
of concern for local manufacturing
interests, are coming in for a lot of
public criticism because in the same
breath thev declare this permit es
tablishes no precedent. "If it makes
no precedent," said a prominent citi
zen to-day. "then it is wrong in prin
ciple and absolutely unfair to the gen
eral business community. What
right has City Council to give such a
permit to one corporation or indi
vidual and not to another? If an
overhead bridge is right on Seventh
street it is right on ai>y other street.
The only justification for such a struc
ture would be the setting apart of a
certain sectioxi of the city for indus
trial purposes where plants or sections
of plants might be united by overhead
runways across streets used only for
business purposes. Council is in wrong
and I'm surprised that this matter has
been jammed through without thought
of the consequences. The people will
be heard from later."
It was stated to-day that the Cham
ber of Commerce had retained counsel
and that immediate steps would be
taken to secure a legal decision
through the courts as to the right of
the city to grant its consent for the
building of such a bridge in a public
highway. It is alleged In legal cir
cles that inasmuch as the erection of
bay windows was prohibited by city
ordinance until certain specific regula
tions were adopted for the guidance
of contracts and builders, on the
ground that such windows obstructed
the view of adjoining property own
ers—the erection of an overhead
bridge across a mixed business and
residential street was clearly an in
fraction of the law as well as an in- i
vasion of the right of the public. It
was reported to-day that property I
owners north of the point where the j
proposed bridge or runway on Seventh
street would be placed are preparing
to join with the Chamber of Com
merce and the Planning Commission
in preventing the structure going up.
Eye Witness Declares
Two 'Double Zeppelins'
Will Haul Mail to U. S.
By Associated Press

carrying capacity of sixty tons, have
been built in Germany to carrv mail

ka ' and "Deutschland." He fras per
mitted to view them, lie declared. Their
engines are powerfully equipped and
they can make the aer.al voyage be
tween Berlin and New York in'seventy
two hours.
"They are so constructed," said
Epstein, "that they can rise higher
than any aeroplane and thus escape
hostile aviators. Thev also can de
scend to the water and travel there
under their own power."
Epstein said the postage charges for
this service had alreadv been arranged
and would be the regular international
postage plus one mark, or 25 cents for
each letter.

Prospects For Settling
N. Y. Difficulties Better
By Associated Press
Xew York, Sspt. 6.—Prospects of
settling the difficulties between the
employes of the subway and elevated
roads and the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company looked a little more
favorable today, although neither side
has receded from its uncompromising
popition.
The labor leaders have decided to
pass the responsibility of calling a
strike to a mass meeting of union em
ployes to-night. There is still hope,
however, that even if the meeting votes
to strike no action will be taken until
Major Mitchel and the Public Service

Birmingham, Eng., Sept. 6.—The

nearly 2,500,000 organized workers of
Great Britain, took an important and
unexpected step to-day by adopting,
with a majority of more than 1,000,-
000 votes, a resolution virtually en
dorsing the principle of protection.
The resolution asks for "the adop
tion of methods for restricting or pre
venting the importation of cheap

lower rates of wages and under worse
labor conditions than prevail in this
country."

REVENUE BELL

Expect to Get Away by Tomor
row; Measure Passed by
Senate in Conference
By Associated Press
Washington, Sept. 6. The only
important piece of work standing in
the way of adjournment, which prob
ably will occur to-morrow or possibly
even late to-night was the smoothing
out to-day of House and Senate dif
ferences on the administration emer
gency revenue bill, providing for the
raising of $205,000,000 annually, the
creation of a tariff commission and
other important economic principles.
This bill, passed last night in the
Senate by a vote of 42 to 16, with
five Republicans voting for it, went to
conference to-day as soon as the
House had gone through the formality
of naming its conferees, several of
whom have been working on it in
formally for the last few days. It is
belteved their report will accept most
Senate amendments including those
adopted yesterday directed against al
lied interference with American trade.
Final consideration of the measure
in the Senate last night was marked
by vain fights of Senator Underwood
to eliminate the tariff commission sec
tion, and of Senator Husting to estab
lish publicity of income tax returns;
and by abandonment under Senator
LaFollette'B threat to filibuster of the
administration plan to include as an
amendment the. Webb bill, which
would permit American exporters to
organize Joint selling agencies for for
eign trade.

STATE GAZETTE 12 A WEEK
A marked advance in the price of
"print" paper and an increased cost of
labor makes it necessary for the pub

the price of that newspaper from 10
cents to 12 cents a week where it is
served by carrier.
The publishers of the State Gazette
regret the necessity for taking this
step, but conditions are such that the
present price, 10 cents a week, barely
pays the cost of the paper on which
the State Gazette is printed.
It is hoped subscribers will under
stand the necessity for this move and
continue to let the State Gazette give
them the best news service obtainable
in this section of the State.
