the reiteration of its 'passion for the
ideals of Atnerica.' of its devotion
to our 'spiritiral needs,' of its con
serration to the 'service cf humanity.'
of its promotion of the 'great ideals and
purposes and longings of the people we

arc 'the trustees of the moral judgment
of the world.'
"Seeing visions and the enunciation of
cryptic phrases do tinot tend to simplify
