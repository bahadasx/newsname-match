Denver. Colo., Sept. 6. Three thou

northern Xew Mexico and woven into
cloth by prehistoric Aztecs. Also they
made rope and twine, perhaps evea
thread, of cotton and of the yucca
plant, known to an enlightened modem
civilization as soaDweed. or Snanlnh

Doys for the manufacture of toy dag
gers. The cotton cloth has been discov
