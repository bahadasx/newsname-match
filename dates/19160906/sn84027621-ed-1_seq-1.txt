PHILADELPHIA LETTER
Philadelphia is the headquarters of
three of the largest railroad corpora
tions in the country and consequently
was very much interested in the im
pending strike and its outcome, and
though there is a spirit of relief in the
fact that it has been averted, the gen
eral opinion of a large part of the peo
ple and the entire press . of the city is
that ' Congress should have kept its
hands off and that the solution that
has been arranged for is wrong and
not in the interest of the public which
will eventually have to pay the bill.
In, counting up the cost of a rail
road strike it was found that there
was ten days provisions of meat al
ways on hand, and that the supply of
coal was about the same, while the
supply of milk and vegetables could
be largely kept up thru the medium of
boats and autos, and it certainly takes
a lot of these to keep a city" of this
size going, especially the babies' milk.
There are two large firms in our
neighborhood who bring their milk
from the country, sterilize, bottle and
distribute to customers, one firm 40,
000 and the other 25,000 quarts each
day, and I suppose there are others
in the city as large.
Another thing, that has been exer
cising the community a great deal
lately is the plague of infant paralysis,
and while it is called "infant" it is in
no wise confined to babies, but seems
to attack older children and grown
people also. The quarantine certainly
is a big nuisance; to get on to a ferry
boat one must pass between a cordon
of police who snatch out every child
and even look suspiciously as a big
man carrying a suitcase for fear he
has a baby concealed inside. Philadel
phia has 760 Sunday schools, all of
which have been out of commission for
the last four Sundays, as the board of
health has forbidden any child under
16 years of age to attend, and the
public say schools which always open
the day after Labor Day are not to be
started, this year until the 29th of
September, and not then unless there
is some decrease in the number of
cases. Children are not allowed on
trains or in moving picture shows and
not only are they barred from Sunday
schools, but a notice is posted On the
church doors, that no children under
sixteen will be admitted to any ser
vice.
Philadelphia has always been con
sidered a slow town, but since the ad
vent of the automobile there has cer
tainly been a grand awakening and
the city fathers have just passed an
ordinance reducing the speed limit
thru the business part of the city to
20 miles an hour, this being made
necessary from the fact that during
the daylight hours and for sometime
after 2000 cars pass the city hall
every hour. But while the speed limit
has been restricted in the center of
the city it does not effect the rest
and at any hour of the day cars are
going past our place making 40 to 50
miles an hour. Of course, there are a
few accidents but there is a decided
improvement lately in that respect,
for last Sunday they only killed six
vhile the previous Sunday the num
ber was thirteen. If some of Ocala's

ALL ATTEMPTS OF RULGARS
Being Devoted to an Academic Dis
cussion of the Owens Corrupt
Practices Bill .
(Associated Press)
Washington, Sept. 6. By a vote of
32 to 14, the Senate today decided to
take up the Owens corrupt practices
bill, greatly curtailing campaign ex
penditures and imposing heavy pen
alties for violations. Seven republi
cans voted with the democrats to take
up the bill, and seven democrats were
against it. - The vote doesn't neces
sarily forecast a delay in the adjourn-1
ing of Congress Thursday, as the
Senate has nothing else before it.
Administration leaders expressed the
opinion the bill couldn't reach a vote.
Republican leaders said they wouldn't
let it come to a vote. It is planned to
adopt a concurrent resolution fixing
the time to adjourn as .quick as the
revenue bill conferees indicate they
have reached an agreement. This
would end debate.
HOLDS OUT HOPE
The House didn't send the revenue
bill to conference formally because
Republican Leader Mann wanted time
to read it. Democratic Leader Kitchin
said Congress would probably adjourn
tomorrow.
TREATMENT BEDS REFERRED
TO TWOMBLEY
Probable that the Engineer Had Sanc
tion of State 'Board of Health
for his Plans
Council last night considered the
report of the state board of health
recommending the use of treatment
beds for the effluent of the Imhoff
tanks of the new sewerage system.
No action will be taken until infor
mation has been obtained from Mr.
Alex Twombly, who was the engi
neer for the sewerage system.
Mr. David Henny, of Twombly &
Henny, engineers, told the council
that he had telegraphed Mr. Twom
bly, and expected to hear from him
today. In the meantime, Mr. Hen
ney1 said that he was satisfied that
Mr. Twombly had authority from the
board of health for leaving off the
treatment beds referred to. President
Nash, of council, said that he remem
bered that Mr. Twombly made a spe
cial trip to consult with the board of
health.
Mr. Henney pointed out that the re
port of the state board of health just
made strongly recommends the use of
treatment of the effluent of the Im
hoff tanks, but does not say specifical
ly that the sewerage system must not
be used without the additional treat
ment. .
According to Mr. Henney, Mr.
Twombly is recognized as one of the
foremost authorities in this country
on sewerage, and is frequently con
suited by the Florida- health board.
Meffert or Joseph Bell, were here,
they would be in no danger of getting
jugged for exceeding.the speed limit;
they would more likely be ordered by
the police to get a move on as they
were blocking the road; tho if my
memory serves me the former was
pulled once in Philadelphia because he
didn't know the port side from the
starboard side of the street.

COIiTRAGTDR MADE WHAT HE CALLED Mill STATE
MENT TO THE COUNCIL .
Engineer Henney yesterday ordered
the brick work at the new light and
water plant torn out as being unsatis
factory, and council last night unani
mously sustained him in his action.
Benjamin Thompson the contractor
for the plant, appeared before council
and contended that he was being done
an injustice in the matter. He told
council that the brick would be torn
out as directed, but that the city
would hear from him later.
"This is not a threat, gentlemen.
It is just a plain statement,", said Mr.
Thompson.
Mr. Henney told council that. a rep
resentative from the brick manufac
turers in Jacksonville said the brick
sent here were not selected according
to the approved samples but were the
"run of the kiln." :
The brick were ordered! torn out by
Mr. Henney because they were not up
to specifications, and for. the reason
that not enough mortar was used in
the beds and joints, and because the
header courses were not all alike,
some being in the seventh course and
some in the sixth.
Mr. Thompson thought that the
brick laying was done properly. He
asked that council investigate the
matter thoroughly for itself. He said
that while the brick were being laid,
Mr. Robert Ebner, as inspector for
Twombly & Henney, had commented
on the work and had found fault with
some of it. Mr. Thompson said that
the inspector could have inspected the
work'as it was done. .
Mr. Henney said that if the inspec
tor had gone up on the wall and in
spected the work to see. that it was
properly done, after the brick had al
ready been rejected, it might have in
volved the city, and the city might
have had to accept the work.
Mr. Henney said that it was true
that samples of the brick were ap
proved but that the brick sent here
did not compare with the samples. He
said that neither the brick nor the
brick work were satisfactory, and that
he could, therefore, accept neither.
He said that Mr. Ebner had rejected
thebrick, and that Mr. Ebner, in the
presence of Mayor Robertson, had in
formed the contractor that the brick,
if used, would be used on the contrac
tor's own responsibility.
Mr. Thompson said that the mayor
was not present when Mr. Ebner re
jected the first car of brick. He said
that Mr. Ebner said at the time that
he did not know whether the brick
were good brick or not. Mr. Thomp
son said that the mayor may have
looked at the car of brick later. He
said that he had heard that the mayor
said that not a single one of the brick
was good.
Mr. Thompson said that samples of
the rejected brick had been tested,
and that, in spite of an unfair test,
the brick were found strong enough
for the work. He said that the part
of the wall Mr. Henney had found
fault with had been washed by a
heavy rain, but that the rain did not
do damage enough to hurt.
Mr. Thompson said that he had re
quested council, and the building com
mittee of that body, to inspect the
work and materials. It was pointed
out in reply that his contract with the
city provided that the engineers would
have the acceptance or rejection of
material and work. The contract
states that any material not approv
ed by the engineers shall be immed
iately taken from the yard.
HELPED OUT HENRY
Council Simplified Some of the Labor
of the City Clerk
Council" last night passed over the
head of the mayor an ordinance to
simplify the work of the city clerk in
keeping his books. The measure had
been prepared at the request of the
clerk, and it had been pointed out that
it simply did away with unnecessary
work. The mayor appears to have
misunderstood the purpose of the or
dinance.

PLUMBING ORDINANCE
WAS PASSED
By the Council Over the Mayor's Veto,
and It Becomes Effective
Immediately
Council last night passed the plumb
ing ordinance over the veto of Mayor
Robertson and it becomes a law im
mediately. The measure provides that
property owners affected shall make
house connections with" the new city
sewerage system within 60 days after
notified by the plumbing inspector. H.
S. Minshall, a master plumber, -who
has been connected with H. W. Tuck
er, was elected inspector by council,
following the passage of the ordi
nance. Mr. Minshall received eight
out of nine votes, with five applicants
for the position.
The mayor, in a message to council
vetoing the ordinance, makes five,
objections, and says that there are
many more that he might urge
against the measure. He objects to
council delegating its powers to a
board consisting of the sanitary com
mittee of that body, the city health
officer and the plumbing inspector. He
does not think that council should
delegate its powers to the sanitary
committee. Council did not think that
it would be practicable for council to
act as a whole. -
"The evils of the council delegating
its authority," says the mayor in his
message, "have been recently shown
by its payment for 100 yards of sew
erage rock excavation on North Main
street at $3 per yard, when there was
no rock excavations whatever. It is
also shown in 'the recent contract for
the cement reservoir in connection
with the new water and light plant,
when payment will be made for work
that is wholly deficient and for which
taxpayers do not get value received,
and clearly shows a waste of the city
funds and a reckless expenditure." It
was said, in answer to this objection,
that council had paid for the rock ex
cavations after the city engineer had
given his approval. Engineer Henney
explained during the evening that the
leaks which had been found in the
reservoir were being repaired, and
that a thorough test was being made
to locate any further leaks. Mr. Hen
ney was asked by Councilman Meffert
if he thought that the reservoir prop
erly constructed. Mr. Henney said
very emphatically that he thought it
was.
The mayor thinks that the council
as a whole should pass on the qualifi
cations of persons wanting to engage
in the plumbing business in the city.
Council thought it proper for the
plumbing board to do the examining.
It was pointed out that council could
always be appealed to if necessary.
The mayor finds that any misunder
standing between a plumber and the
plumbing inspector should be submit
ted to council instead of to the plumb
ing board, whose decision in the mat
ter the ordinance makes final. Council
did not see any merit in this objec
tion. The mayor contends that under sec
tion 15 of the measure property own
ers, who already have installed plumb
ing that might be perfectly sanitary
in every respect, would be forced to
the expense of making a change. It
was pointed out that the ordinance
elsewhere provides that the inspector
shall determine whether or not
plumbing is sanitary.
"I see no good reason," says Mayor
m if!

(Associated
New London, Conn., Sept. 6. The
American-Mexican joint commission
of six held its first formal session at
the Hotel Groton here today. Luis
Cabrera presided. The session is ex
pected to be devoted to arranging the
details of future conferences, altho'
Secretary Lane, chairman of ' the
American commission, indicated it
might discuss the subjects to be re
viewed.
It had not been determined just who
would attend in addition to the mem
bers when the meeting opened. James

may participate.
It is anticipated that when the con
ferees take up specific questions, be

necessary in order to review data on
the question. t
GOOD RESULTS FROM
OILING THE STREETS
Councilman Mclver, chairman of the
street committee, and the other mem
bers of the council, are impressed
with the results obtained by the use
of oil on the streets. Since the city
oiled Ocklawaha avenue, the first of
the year, there has been little or no
repair work done. More oil will be
purchased, and additional streets oil
ed. Councilman Mclver is of the
opinion, too, that any rough places
appearing on the oiled streets should
be repaired as they appear. He has
just finished repairing the Lake
Weir road from South Eighth street
to the city limits, and contemplates
giving it a coat of oil and sand.
Extra labor will be employed for
the work on the Silver Springs road,
and Mr. Mclver wants the assistance
of the citizens who recently volun
teered to aid in the repairing of this
popular and important highway.
Councilman Mclver has also point
ed out the necessity of having a
tank to keep oil in for street pur
poses, so that it will not be necessary
to use the oil indiscriminately mere
ly to get it out of the tank cars in
which it comes.
NEW FIRE DISTRICT
WILL BE ESTABLISHED
A new fire district has been estab
lished by the council in the passage
of an ordinance last night. In the
fire district, as provided for in the
new ordinance, are included all of
blocks 34, 35, 36, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46,
47, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, the west half
of block 60, all of blocks 63, 74, 65, 66,
67, 75, and 76 of the old survey of
the city, and blocks A, D, E, F, G, I,
and K of Dunn's central addition, al
so the block north of . block D of
Dunn's central addition, and the block
north of block A of this addition. In
and on blocks 25, 26 and 37 of the old
survey of the city, no building can be
erected unless the outside walls are
covered with iron, or some metal
sheeting, and roof of metal, slate,
terra cotta, or some other fire proof
material, provided that this does not
prohibit the erection of buildings
in the fire district must be construct
ed of stone, brick, or concrete, with
fire proof roofs.
Robertson, "why any provision should
be made for cess pools, when the sew
erage system is accessible, and no ex
ception or discrimination should be
made regarding sewerage connec
tions." Council thought this objection
was also covered by the ordinance,
which provides that cesspools shall be
used only where connection with the
sewerage system is not feasible. The
ordinance calls for a sanitary cess
pool, wherever it is necessary to in
stall one. It was pointed out that
there is a difference between a cess
pool and a sewer well. The ordinance
does not permit sewer wells at all.
