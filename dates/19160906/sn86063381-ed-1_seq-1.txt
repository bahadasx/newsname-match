Under Instructions of the City
Council.
LAN BAND STAND AT
POINT OF CITY PARE
Central Portion of Park to Be Given
for Playgrounds Bath Houses
are Planned.
Acting under instructions of the
Bemldji city council", Morell & Nich
.landscape architects and engi
n-ers of, Minneapolis^ have made a,
survey of the grounds at Diamond:
Point park and have prepared a gen
eral ,plan for^he arrangement otthe
Brk to conform with the improver
H*enji of the norma} school grounds.
A, copy of the plans was printed in
the Pioneer a week ago.
At a meeting of the city council
Monday, the architects .Submitted a
report, parts of which are asfollows:
Parks are United.
"In order that you may see the
^srelation of the scheme to that of the
wrttudy for the normal school grounds,
we have incorporated both the sur
vey and general plan of the normal
school grounds In working out the
general scheme we have taken into
consideration the advisability of serv
ing the individual needs of the city
park, as a unit, and yet to combine
and unite the entire scheme with
that of the normal school grounds.
For instance, while one of the drives
extending through the normal school
grounds, unites and forms a part of
the system of drives in the city park,
a separate entrance is made to the
city park at the assumed terminal of
Doud avenue. We understand that
this point where Doud avenue turns,
rhas
Mi
not been definitely determined
upon. _
Scheme is Simple.
"In view of the fact that the park,
as already existing, is so naturally
beautiful in the splendid growth of
trees and fine outlook over the lake,
we have endeavored in working out
the general plan to keep the scheme
just as simple and free from any for
mahty as is possible. An informal
I drive is shown extending around the
I borders of the park, thus opening up
jts beauties to vehicular traffic Path
-connections have also been shown
fly from the entrance and from the con
A nections with the normal school
grounds, widening through the trees
and extending to various points of
interest. We have tried to keep as
few paths as is practical, it being the
idea that the roads can also be util
ized and in fact a portion of these
could be natural trails through the
woods in all locations where feasible
Dock Facilities.
"We would call your attention to
the fact that in the development of
this park, it is undoubtedly true that
as it becomes a point of interest to
the residents of your city, it will'
be advisable to provide dock facili
ties so that an approach to the park
can be made by persons coming with
canoes, row boats, or even launches
"On the north shore, where such
a splendid beach is available and the
water is so shallow, we have suggest
ed that provisions be made for bath
ing and if so desired, dressing rooms
can be provided for this purpose.
"In view of the sightliness of the
location of the extreme point of land,
we have chosen this point, in our
^Ipheme as a possibility of strong de
velopment, and using this as a focal
point in the entire scheme At such
a time as your council might feel
that the expenditure is warranted,
a splendid architectural feature could
be worked out at this point, using
a parapet wall to act as a protection
and also to serve as an outlook over
the entire lake
Construct Band Stand.
"A band stand could be constructed
at this point and seats provided to
make provision for the crowds that
would naturally tend to congest at
this point. Such an architectural
development at this location would
not only serve as a most interesting
ature in the development oi the
ark itself, but would also be most
attractive and serve as a land mark
in its appearance from the lake. The
space to the west could be utilized
for parking automobiles.
"The central portion, of tire park
is given up to general recreation ana
tor picnics and it" is our idea that
Such playground apparatus as might
tie installed ,frbm .time to time, could
be scattered informally in the woods
^fcd, thus prevent any bare play
ground space being necessary."/
