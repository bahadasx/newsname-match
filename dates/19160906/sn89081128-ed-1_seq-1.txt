V( »LUME XXXVII.
NEW BUILDINGS ON
MINNESOTA STREET
WEISER BLOCK TO BE READY
^FOR OCCUPANCY BY MIDDLE
OF OCTOBER.
DAKOTA HOUSE DOLLING UP.
BECKER'S RESTAURANT ON
SOUTH^SIDE.
.jJVhen the Weiser building on North
j£mnesota street is completed it will
mark the opening of New Ulm's most
modern building. The structure itself
is 26 by 100 feet and when furnished is
estimated to cost the proprietor ap
proximately $20,000. It is two stories
high and the floor space reaches a total
of over five thousand square feet.
Twin City Brick have been used in
the construction of the building and
with its New Jersey Terra Cotta finish
it is a very handsome affair. The con
tractors, Puhlmann Bros., have put as
many men as possible at work on the
building and according to the present
outlook the building will be ready for
occupancy from the first to the fifteenth
of October..
F. W. Peuser will occupy the front
part of the basement of the Weiser
building and will have one of the best
barber shops in the Northwest. Hot
and cold shower baths will be installed
Sand the furniture will be of the most
rnqdern.
The entire first floor will be occupied
by Andrews & Ellis who will conduct
a modern candy kitchen. Ice cream,
sodas and confectionery will be sold.
The proprietors, who own several stores
in Minneapolis plan to install furniture
of the latest models. Booths will also
be installed so that patrons can have
privacy and all the modern conveniences
that belong to a first class Greek candy
kitchen will be installed. The back part
of the basement will be used by the
company for the making of their candy
andMce cream. The floor of-the apart
ment will be made of white tiling and
the display window will rest on window
sills built of small green tiles.
The top floor is divided into eleven
rooms, the front three of which will be
occupied by the Pfaender Fire In
surance Agency and the Building &
Loan Association. Alfred W. Mueller
yrill also remove his law office from his
present location in the Dietz block to
tme Weiser building and will have three
rooms. Iron vaults will be installed
for the convenience of these two, one
vault for each. Co. Attorney Adolph
Frederickson who will move to this city
in the near future will also occupy several
rooms on this floon
Other improvements to be noted on
Minnesota Street are those being made
at the Dakota House which is having
a new coat of stucco put on over the old
cement which had begun to drop off.
This will improve the looks of the place
greatly
Another hew building that is pro
gressing rapidly is the Becker restaurant
and pool hall which is located on South
Minnesota Street. It will be constructed
of white granite brick and will cost about
$18,000 when completed. The first floor
will be divided in the middle by a par
tition, the right side to be used as a
restaurant and the left as a pool hall.
A large door will lead into both the
restaurant and the pool hall.
The top floor will be furnished by Mr.
Becker and part of the rooms will be
rented. The front rooms will be oc
'. cupied by the Becker family.
CELEBRATION OF LABOR DAY.
Labor Day badges were very much in
evidence on the streets of New Ulm
Monday and more so at Hermanns
Heights where the New Ulm Arbeiter
Verein held its annual picnic.
With the exception of only a few
states, not to exceed seven in all, the
first Monday in September has been
B&ade a legal holiday. The first state
to declare this day a legal holiday was
the State of Colorado in 1887. Since
then nearly every state in the Union
has followed suit. In the larger cities
"Labor Day" has become one of the
big days and monster parades are held,
speeches are made tending to rouse the
working men from their apathy to a
realization of their importance and power.
This year "Labor Day" was to have had
a special significance. It was on this
ay at 7 a. m. that approximately
200,000 members of the Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen were to walk out and
inaugurate the biggest strike this country
had ever seen. Fortunately Congress
passed an 8 hour law for certain classes
of railway workmen and the strike was
averted.
Very few of .the smaller citites observe
"Labor Day" as a holiday. New Ulm
makes a notable exception, all because it
has the "Arbeiterverein" which ar
ranges a picnic for this day. The
merchants are prevailed upon to close
their places of business for the afternoon
and this was done again this year and
all of the stores were closed when the
"New Ulm Arbeiterverein" shortly after
one o'clock preceded by the, New Ulm
Concert Band marched thru Minnesota
Street and up to Hermann's Heights.
The attendance at the picnic was very
good, larger than it had been for some
years and from a financial and social
viewpoint the affair was a success. There
was prize-bowling, prize shooting, a dance
in the dancing pavilion and singing the
German folksong was very much in
evidence. It is to be regretted that there
was no speech-making. Speeches show
ing the significance of the labor move
ment are always in order on Labor Day
and should not be omitted. The New
Ulm Arbeiterverein was organized almost
a quarter of a century ago and has now
about 260 members.
Henry Brey and family, formerly
residents of this city, passed thru New
Ulm enroute to Jamestown North,
Dakota Sunday. They visited a short
time with friends in the city but resumed
their journey Monday morning. They
are making the trip by auto.

Of Delinquents
FAIRMONT CREDITORS TIRED
OF WAITING FOR DEBTORS
TO PAY.
Fairmont business men have taken a
new method of getting their money from
people who refuse to pay their bills.
This week's issue of the Martin County
Independent contains a three column
advertisement signed by the Fairmont
Business Men's Association in which
appear the names of all delinquent
customers of the business men represented
by the Association. These delinquent
accounts are advertised for sale and bids
are asked. The amounts of the bills
run from 55 cents to $102.63. The
biggest bills thruout the list seem to be
for meat and one may draw his own
conclusions as to the reasons for that.
Glancing thru the list, one finds but
very few bills listed by the professional
men altho they appear often enough to
indicate that the doctors, dentists, etc.,
are members of the association. Must
be that the reason the professional people
are generally pretty well-to-do is because
they have the knack of asking a good
price for their services and then getting it.
No doubt it is also due to the fact that
when a man calls in a doctor he knows
what it is going to cost him and that he
must pay it and he can not get the service
cheaper anywhere else. That is what
plays hob with other lines of business.
It used to be said "Competition is the
life of trade". It is now known that it
is much more apt to be the death of the
business that indulges in it, and pro
fessional men realized that fact long ago
and set their schedules. As a result
their prices are known and respected and
their bills are paid.
The items most frequently mentioned
in the list of delinquent accounts are
merchandise and clothing and one party
was tempted to indulge in hose to the
extent of $7.13 but whether this was the
silk kind or the plain garden variety does
not appear. Whether publicity will
bring about the desired result and "rake
the wind," or not, we do believe it
will raise some storm and it may also
have a deterrent effect on others who
may be inclined to buy things necessary
and otherwise and let the dealer whistle
for his pay.
BENEFIT PICNIC POSTPONED.
The benefit picnic which was planned
for next Sunday will not be given until
the 17th of September. All arrange
ments had been made to go ahead with
preparations for the 10th but conditions
arose which made it seem necessary to
put off the festivities a week. Further
announcement of the plans will be made
next week.
Dr. L. A. Fritsche was in St. Paul
Monday where he attended the conven
tion of the German-American Alliance.
CONGRESS RELIEVES
STRIKE SITUATION
EIGHT HOUR LAW SATISFIES
DEMANDS OF STRIKING
TRAIN MEN
MEANS ENORMOUS INCREASES
IN COST OF OPERATION OF
RAILROADS.
At practically the last moment, a way
was found out of the difficulty with the
trainmen who were threatening to strike
and tie up the whole transportation
system of the country. Congress rose
to the occasion and passed an eight hour
law which satisfied the trainmen and the
railways were obliged to accede to the
solution of the problem. They had re
fused absolutely and flatly to grant the
eight hour day asked by the Brother
hood and the Brotherhood had refused
to allow the matter to be arbitrated and
there the question hung with orders
issued by the Brotherhood that all
members should refuse to take their
trains out after 7 o'clock Monday morn
ing, Sept. 4th.
There is little doubt that the present
solution of the difficulty is not the final
answer. If the railroads carry this
matter to the Supreme Court as they
threaten to do and win out, then the
strike will loom up as big as ever. If
the law is declared constitutional, there
can hardly be any question that the
railroads have secured a leverage to use
in the process of hoisting freight rates
and as usual the public will pay the
additional wages demanded by the train
men.
It is hard for people not fully ac
quainted with railroad business to know
who was in the right in the dispute. To
the average workingman the wages paid
the trainmen would seem to be ample
and a great deal of unfavorable comment
was heard concerning the position they
took in the matter. Apparently they
were determined to have the wages they*
demanded no matter what the cost to
any one. Ostensibly they were striking
for an eight hour day but what they
really wanted was pay for ten hours and
work only eight with time and a half for
anything over the eight hours.
As the railroads have their schedules
and division points arranged at present
it would be impossible for them to get
their men back home in the eight hours
and they would therefore be compelled
either to rearrange the entire system or
pay time and a half for practically a
fourth of a day and they claimed that
they could not do it. Now7. it would
seem that they are to be compelled to do
it whether they can or not*
It may cost a 5 per cent increase ih the
freight rates ojf the country to meet the
additional expense. The railroads have
said that they will find it very difficult to
meet the sudden drain caused by the new
regulations because even if Congress
would allow them to boost freight rates
immediately it would take them six
months to get their tariffs lined up and
in the meantime some of the weaker
roads would be put oh the toboggan and
all would feel the strain badly.
The average yearly wages paid the
trainmen are given as follows:
Passenger Service.
Engineers $2,195
Conductors 1,878
Firemen 1,317
Brakemen 967
Freight Service.
Engineer $2,071
Conductor 1,935
Firemen 1,181
Brakemen 1,135
Yard Men.
Engineer $1,378
Conductor 1,355
Firemen 973
Brakemen 1,107
CONCERT ARRANGED FOR NEXT
SUNDAY.
While it is impossible to publish the
program of the Band Concert for next
Sunday evening at Turner Hall Park,
there will be a concert and programs
will appear in the New Ulm Post. The
boys were so busy Monday playing for
the Labor Day picnic that they did not
have band practise that evening and the
programs will not be arranged until this
evening. A big crowd turned out Sun
day for the last concert and the boys
feel well repaid for their efforts to please.
The constant practise they are getting
also shows in the rapid improvement
they are making in their work.

A story has been going" the rounds in
New Ulm that Ray Brust of Sleepy Eye
was caught with a number of birds in his
possession last week and that a stiff fine
and the confiscation of his hunting' pro
perty followed the offense. It was im
possible to verify the story altho parties
in Sleepy Eye who should know about
the matter were questioned. However,
the statement was made that a great
many at Sleepy Eye deserve to be caught
and punished for this kind of sportsman
ship and it is probable that New Ulm has
its quota of fellows who likewise should
be found out.
The federal regulations forbid shooting
migratory birds before sunrise and after
sunset of each day. Following is the
sunrise and sunset schedule for the
shooting season as furnished by the
Government Weather Observer at the

Shooting or pursuing waterfowl on
open water by means of motor boats
or otherwise, is unlawful. Shoothig
must be done from shore or from the
natural vegetation growing in the water,
or from blinds constructed in such
vegetation, or from passes.
The open season for shooting water
fowl and upland game birds, except
quail and partridge, will open Thursday,
September 7. Every one who proposes
to go afield should become familiar with
the regulations which govern shooting
in this state, which regulations are
enacted for the purpose of preserving
the shooting for other years to come.
Licenses are required of all residents
of the state who desire to shoot game
birds, except of minors and persons
shooting only on farms which they own
or lease and on which they reside.
These licenses cost $1.00 and are ob
tainable of the county auditors. The
non-resident license fee for game birds
is $10.00, obtainable of the. State Game
and Fish Commissioner.
No person is permitted to take more
than 15 wild ducks in one day, nor more
than 10 of all other varieties of game
birds combined. Forty-five ducks may
be had in possession—30 of all other
birds, at one time.
Coots, or "mudhens", are classed as
ducks and have the same protection.
Rails, gallinules and grebes, or "divers,"
are protected birds and must not be
killed at all. Wood ducks are protected
by both state and federal law until
Sept.,7, 1918.

COLLISION SENDS TWO CARS
TO HOSPITAL OCCUPANTS
UNHURT
This week's automobile accident re
sulted in a couple of badly damaged cars
and an almost miraculous escape of the
six persons who were riding, from broken
bones or worse. The smash-up oc
curred at the corner of South First Street
aribT "Minnesota just about six o'clock
Saturday evening. The cars concerned
were owned by John Bartl and Joe
Wartha. The Bartl car was driven by
Peter Brey and is a big Overland. The
Wartha car is a Stoddard-Dayton road
ster.
Wartfha, who is employed at the
Review office, had been on an errand to
some place east of the railroad tracks
and was returning. As he came up
First Street South from the C. & N. W.
tracks he noticed the Bartl car going
south on Minnesota Street. As the big
car reached the Minnesota House corner
the driver turned to go down South
First Street, intending to make the turn
properly according to the laws of the
road. As he turned, however, a bicyclist
was standing with his wheel near the
middle of the street and on the right
hand side were the wagons standing
near the Palace Livery. In avoiding
them and the bicyclist, Brey either lost
control, jerked the wheel or gave the
car a little too much gas, and the big
Overland leaped forward and shot over
the crossing on the east side of Minnesota
street between Dongus' store and the
Palace Livery and brought up full force
against the front part of Wartha's car.
Wartha had seen how nearly the Over
land came to striking the bicyclist and
remarked to his companion, Henry Alex,
what a narrow shave it was and the next
moment the collision had happened.
He had released his engine when he saw
the Overland making the" turn in order
to keep out of its way when he saw it
coming but the collision was inevitable.
Mr. Bartl, owner of the Overland car,
said that he felt that he has a case
against the city for allowing the Palace
Livery to keep their vehicles standing
but in the roadway and taking up nearly
a third of the space. He feels that the
collision would never have occurred had
there been a clear space at the right side.
Seated in the back seat of the Bartl car
were three girls and they were hurled
completely out of the car and struck in
the roadway without anything more
than a bad shaking up. The driver re
tained bis place in the front seat.
When the cars were hauled into the
South Side garage it was found that the
roadster had its front wheel on the left
side smashed from tire to spindle, both
axles broken, the steering gear put out
of commission and another tire ripped
to pieces. The Overland sustained prac
tically the same injuries and the frame
was badly twisted. The garage men
said that the damages to both cars would
run upwards of $300.00 or more.

1916 FAIR DRAWS
BEST ATTENDANCE
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY CARS
PARKED AT FAIR GROUNDS
FRIDAY.
RECEIPTS MORE THAN $200.C*
OVER THOSE OF LAST
YEAR.
Nothing more could have been ex
pected of the weather man than what he
supplied in the way of his product for
the days of the Brown County Fair.
Cloudy mornings caused some appre
hension but the sky cleared Friday early
enough so that no one who really ex
pected to come to New Ulm was kept
at home and a record breaking crowd was
in attendance.
The number of exhibits was not so
large as some previous years. A lack
of space prompted some of the merchants
to omit their usual displays but there
was nothing empty about the administra
tion building as it was crowded to the
edges with excellent samples of the fruit,
vegetables, grains and handiwork of the
community. There were some very
beautiful specimens of lace work, fine
sewing and embroidery to say nothing
of the drawings and paintings which
were entered by the several young people
of the city who are looking forward more
or less' to an artistic career. These
drawings and paintings show great im
provements over those of earlier years.
Probably the exhibit which drew the
greatest number of spectators' attention
was that of the Sleepy Eye Girls and
Boys Canning Club. This Club was
formed by the agricultural teacher of the
Sleepy Eye Public Schools and he was irt
charge. Several of the Club members
were on hand in their uniform of cap
and apron, showing just how the work is
done. They seemed to be very handy
at the work and well exemplified the
home training that the young people
may secure in the schools of today.
The New Ulm schools had a,very good
exhibit of work from the Manual Train
ing and Domestic Science Departments.
Mr. Haynes, manual training teacher
was in charge, and explained to visitors,
the various kinds of work undertaken in
the city schools in addition to the book
courses. There were a large number of
samples of sewing done by pupils and
a smaller number of exhibits in the line
of cookery that smelled and looked very
good, indeed. The Mechanical Drawing
exhibit was also particularly good.
G. A. Ottomeyer had a very nice
display of ladies' fur garments and there
wae the usual fine display of musical,
instruments from the Winkelmann Music
Store. The hardware dealers as usual1
had their space well taken care of and
showed fascinating collections of kitchen
ware that would make any woman un
happy unless she could have something
like them. The Red Front Grocery had
a corner in which a pleasing array of
their brand of canned goods were tempt
ingly displayed.
Metzinger's Clothing Store had a good
display of men's wearing apparel and
made to order goods. A model dis
played the fit of the coats and Mr.
Dapper, the tailor in charge of the Meta
inger tailoring department, showed the
care with which orders are taken and
executed.
The florists may. always be depended
upon to furnish two very handsome
exhibits. The Dill people had a collec
tion of foliage plants and the New Ulm
Greenhouses showed some very beautiful
flowers in addition to the banks of
foliage. Other floral entries were made
by Mrs. George Marti, being three
baskets made of watermelons and
pumplins containing cut flowers. Another
exhibit shown by the Martis consisted of
a gigantic lawn vase of trailing vines.
It took six strong men to lift this vase
with its creepers into position in the
administration building but the pleasure
it gave to fair visitors repaid the effort.
From every one who passed could be
heard exclamations of delight^at its
beauty and grace.
In the pantry store department were
a large number of entries and house
wives particularly were interested in this
display and stood about exchanging:
experiences in the handling of fruits and
vegetables in various methods of pre
preserving them. E. H. Haeberle was
exhibiting a pressure outfit such as is
advocated by the Department of Agri
culture for the preserving of vegetables
in water only. •',.--
