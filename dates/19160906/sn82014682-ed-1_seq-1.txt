declarations of opinion. In addition to

Lieut-Col. John Maclnnes direct from

New Zealand where he will be chief
secretary of Salvation Army work. He
spent several hours here with local
Salvation Army . workers. Mrs. Mac
lnnes and their two daughters, Esther
and Catherine, accompany hlm.v
' Maclnnes left London August 5 and
has since been traveling across the
Atlantis ocean, part of the states and
part of Canada and last over the pa
cific.' He says the whole of England
has been converted into one great
war camp with everything commercial
aa well as military appropriated and

as those where anything necessary to

common belief now is that the day of
peace is approaching."
Victorious Peace Expected
Maclnnes does not infer, however,
that England would accept anything

"There Is no dissatisfaction in Eng

ments. "England. Ireland, Scotland J
and Wales are united with all the col

regardless of the cost or time of
struggle.- Everything was - scarce at
the first of the war but now there is
plenty of men, munitions and money."
