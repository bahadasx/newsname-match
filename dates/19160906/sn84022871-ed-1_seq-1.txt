When Barton village really sets out
to do something it usually succeeds.
Well, Barton village has set out to
have a genuine guest day on Friday of
next week, through its Improvement
club. The people of the surrounding
towns are invited to come to town and
make themselves at home, without
money and without price.
Tbe rooms of the Barton Improve
ment club will be headquarters. Their
rooms are located over the Pierce drug
store and the entrance is at the
double doors near the middle of the
block. Here guests may check any
articles of clothing for the afternoon
and obtain information concerning
events. Toilet rooms may be found
here.
At 1 o'clock the doors of the Gem
moving picture theatre will be thrown
open to Barton's guests and a contin
uous show will be run until 4 o'clock,
and persons may stay in as long or as
short a time as suits their convenience.
At 1 o'clock all those who desire to
do so will be taken on a cruise of
Crystal lake in motor boats and a
second cruise will be made at 2.30
o'clock. At 3 o'clock there will be a
ball game on the fair grounds between
Orleans and Barton and then at 7.30
o'clock in the evening begins the
great free band concert and corn roast
on the fair grounds. Numerous fires
will be kindled, there will be a wagon
load of corn, sticks with which to roast
it, and there will be some fun.
Automobiles will be provided to get
guests to and from the fair grounds for
the ball game in the aiternoon ana
every cemfort and convenience will be
provided. And everything will be
free; the picture shows, the boat
rides, the ball game, the corn roast
and the concert.
Barton wants you to come. It is
making preparations for a sort of half
holiday, winding up with the big corn
roast and concert event in the evening.
Barton wants to reciprocate. Now
give us a chance and see what we can
do.
This bard concert will take the place
of the Saturday evening concert of
that week, and is tbe last public con
cert of the season. Bear this in mind.
Look for still further announcements
