HE BALKS AT RATE
OF $4 PER DAY
Says He Understood It Was
To Be $4 For the Entire -Party..
Superintendent Samuel S. Slawson
of the Bridgeport public schools finds
himself today In the unenviable 'posi
tion of a person who has Jumped a
hotel bill.'
Deputy Sheriff ( Thomas J. Cunning
ham received, yesterday, from Henry
Piatt,, proprietor of the. Hotel Berk
shire, a fashionable resort in the his
toric and -picturesque town .of Litch
field, a bill for $16 against Slawson.
He asked the sheriff to collect it.
Cunningham has sent the bill to
Slawson for the latter's attention.
Slawson says the trouble arises from
a misunderstanding over the rate
which his party was to be charged.
Whether the rate was to be $4 for his
party of four, overnight, or $4 each,
is the question in dispute. Henry
Piatt says the rate was to be $4 each,
while Slawson says it was to be $4
for the party, or, If the party had
breakfast, $2 each;
Slawson is wroth at the develop
ments. He declares he won't stand
for the charge, and adds that he isn't
he first one to object.- Piatt, equally
Insistent, says Slawson must pay or
else talk it over with the sheriff.
"I understand Dr. Slawson is a re
sponsible man in your veity and that
he will pay," said Manager Piatt to
day. "I have no desire to embarrass
him or injure his credit and 1 would
rather say nothing about the matter,
but my rates are fixed, and I cannot
deviate from theirw I would like to
have the matter settled. "
Slawson and his party 4ro up to
the hotel about 10 o'clock two weeks
ago Sunday evening. They wanted
accommodations but as the hotel was
full I told them I would, get them
rooms In the cottage. I jtold them
distinctly the rate wauiabe $4 eacn
for lodging and breakfast, as I have
to pay extra for rooms in cottages.
They were satisfied. Next morning,
however, Mr, Slawson k disputed -k the
bilL. He got excited finally and drove
off without paying. He did want to
pay me $2 each for his party, but as
my rates are $4, $5 and $6-per day,
and I had told him his rate would be
$4 each,, I could not accept his offer.
"While he was disputing about his
bill another party came to settle and
they started a dispute, too, taking- the
cue from the doctor. But this party
finally settled with me.. I made the
rate' to Dr. Slawson In the presence
of witnesses and. he ought to pay the
bill.
When -asked about the matter, to
day, Supt. Slawson admitted thero had
been a dispute with the manager of
the Hotel Berkshire over the rates and
that he had left without paying his
bill. "
"I offered to settle with him," said
Supt. Slawson today, "but he wouldn't
accept my offer. considered his
charges exorbitant I am still ready
to settle for what is the proper
amount. It was merely a misunder-
tsanding as to the rates. We were on
an automobile trip. There were four
in my party. We stopped for the night
and had lodging in a cottage and
breakfast in the hotel in the morning.
'We understood the rate for the
lodging was to b $4 for the party or
f3 eacn, including oreamasc insioaa
of that the management tried to
charge us $4 each. I objected and of
fered to settle at the rate at which we
accepted' accommodations, but the
manager wouldn't take the money.
We then left the hotel. Today I have
received a bill charging me at the $4
rate. I have not decided what couraw
I shall now take.
"Those In my party were not the
only parties who had similar experi
ences and disputes over the rates. A
wealthy haberdasher of Fifth avenue.
New Tork city, also claimed that he
was being overcharged and he had a
dispute oyer the amount of his bill.
These things all happened while we
were in the hotel waiting to settle our
bill and resume our Journey."
SIEMON PLANT
IS CLOSED BY
SUDDEN STRIKE
The Slemon Hard Rubber corpora
tion's plant on State street, extension
is closed today as thoj result of a
strike situation which grew so rapidly
last night that even the factory and
International union heads are. in
doubt as to the technical situation.
It was reported this morning that
the entire factory force numbering
nearly 200 men were on the streets.
Carl Siemon, president of the corpora
tion admitted the fact and stated that
although he had made every effort
to ascertain the union status of the
men he had been unsuccessful in hav
ing officials of the Federal Union
sent to him.
Vice President Patrick Duffy of the
Federal Unions affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor and
George Bowen, business agent of the
Machinists' union, were unacquaint
ed with the situation at noontime to
day though it was later arranged
that a meeting should be held with
the factory heads looking towards a
settlement. It is understood that a

INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVES OF
GARMENT WORKERS COMING HERE
TO SURVEY CONDITIONS OF STATE
Piesident Schlesinger Who Settled New York Labor Dif
ficulties of the Garment Workers to Preside. Over
Session Opening Here This Week.
' As a stimulus to the general , cam
paign for organization to be forced in
Connecticut, Bridgeport is to 'be 'the
seat this Week of the first general
executive board meeting of the Inter
national Ladies' Garment Workers'
Union.
The meeting which is scheduled to
be held at The Stratfield, beginning
Friday morning, Sept. 8, will bring 15
vice presidents from various states in
the . Union and Canada. President
Benjamin Schlesinger and First Vice
President John F. Pierce will preside
at the -session where it is expected
some most important matters concern
ing to the further organizing of the
corset workers in this state and
throughout New England will be dis
cussed. ' ; '
The International Ladies' Garment
Workers' Union is the third largest
union affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor. It has a mem
bership of 140,000 workers. '
In discussing the departure from
former precedent and the coming to
Bridgeport of President Schlesiager,
who probably mbre than any other in
dividual was responsible for the suc
cessful settlement of the recent cloak
makers' strike in New Tork, First
Vice President John F. Pierce, who
was in Bridgeport today, said:
"This is the first meeting ever held
in the state of Connecticut ' of the
Garment Workers' executive board,
and it is expected that some very im

HONOR MEMORY
OFFR. JANKOLA,
SLOVAKCHAPLAIN
National Convention De
votes Greater Part of Day
to Memorial Services. '
High tribute to the memory of Rov.
Matthew Jankola, deceased pastor of
Sts, Cyril . and Methodius church In
this city, and national chaplain of the!
First Catholic Slovak Union of,
America, was paid by priests from
various parts of the United States and
officers of the Union at a special re
quiem mass held in this city today. ,
The second day of the national con
vention, in this city, was mainly .de
voted to a session of sorrow for 'de
parted chaplains and members of the
order who have died during the past
two years. '
Many visiting priests were in the
city and a special appeal was made to
the delegates today to have the, indi
vidual lodges of the Slovak Unin Join
the Catholic Slovak federation, a
strictly religious body, throughout the
United States and elsewhere. t '
An attempt to amend by-laws for
the Union was made this afternoon,
action on which will be deferred until
after a committee has passed upon
the changes recommended.
Tonight a special entertainment for
the visiting delegates will be given by
the children of -Sts. Cyril Methodus
parish school. -.
Opening with a requiem mass la
the church celebrated by Rev. An
drew Pavco, 1 Freeland, Pa., present
chaplain of the organization, assisted
by Rev. Joseph Kasparek, Catasau-
qua, Pa., and. Rev. J. M. Leschinsky
of Cleveland, O.; Rev. Wencelaus
Kloucik, of St. Claire. Pa., and Rev.
Gaspard Panlk of this city, the con
vention adjourned to Sohol hall.
In an eloquent address before the
body. President Joseph Kiesel deliv
ered eulogy upon the two chaplains
who had departed during the past two
years. Rev. S. Furdeck of Cleveland,
and his successor. Rev. -Matthew Jan
kola, of Bridgeport.
In speaking upon the good work
done by Father Jankola during 'the
short space of time he was permitted
to minister to the Slovak Union he
recalled the appointment of the local
priest to the chaplaincy, Jan. 21, 1915,
and the short but distinctive services
rendered to the time of his death,
May 5, 1916. '
In glowing terms he painted the
picture of a priest who was beloved
not alone by the members of his own
parish here, but by all in the Slovak
Union as well as the entire Slovak
race in America.
"He was an exemplary priest," said
President Kiesel, "and in spite of the'
fact that he was greatly overworked
in his own parish here, he devoted a
great deal of time to the uplift of the
Slovak Union in the hope that his
effort might do some good for his
people in this country. Thugh his
work was cut short by the Creator,
his devotion to all with whom he
came in contact will endure and the
entire race will pray that iis sout
(Continued on Page 2)
ers will be Started at this session.
"Owing to the great struggle of the
cloakmakers of New. Tork, which last
ed for 13 weeks, and won-the admira
tion of the entire labor world as well
as many influential people, it was im
possible to give the attention neces
sary to Connecticut, but It is believed
that at this meeting, a staff of organ
izers will be placed throughout .the
state that will materially add to the
already large membership of the In
ternational Ladies' Garment Workers'
Union. i
"In the last two years, great pro
gress has been made by this Inter
national union. Agreements hive been
signed which gave to the workers an;
increase in pay, with a substantial re
duction in the hours of labor in the
following cities: Philadelphia, Chi
cago, Boston, New Tork, Bridgeport,
New Haven and Springfield.
"Locals No. SS and 14 of Bridge
port, the Corset Workers Unions,
have a membership of 8,200, and are
live and progressive organizations. The
same can be said of Locals No. 89 and
40" ot New Haven." .- .
A mass meeting of Local No. 81
will be held on Friday evening. Sept
8, at Odd Fellows hall on Broad
street, 'at which addresses will be
given by President Schlesinger, and
several of the International, vice presi
dents. ' Among those who, will attend
this meeting are representatives from
Toronto, Montreal,' Cleveland, Toledo,
Boston, Philadelphia, 1 Mew ! Tork,
Cincinnati and Chicago'.
STREMLAU URGES
AMENDMENTS TO
LABOR STATUTES
.. -
President of State Federa
tion Asks Important
Changes in Laws. .
Hartford, Sept. 6. When'-the dele
gates to the Connecticut Federation of
Labor arrived at the convention hall
today for the second day's session they
found at their plaftes printed booklets
giving in detail all the proceedings of
Tuesday and advance notices oil what
would be done today. This was In
line with a suggestion made yesterday
that the proceedings of the convention
be printed dally for the convenience of
the members. , .
There was no lessening of interest in
the sessions, as the delegates were on
hand early, and hardly had the con
vention resumed its session at 10
o'clock when W. B. Holland, of New
Tork city, Held representative of the
American; Fair -Trade league, was in
the midst of an explanation as to why
the Stephen-Ashhurst bill for the elim
ination of unfair competition In trades,
should be adopted by the United
States government . and should be
backed by the federations of labor
throughout the states as well as by
the national labor organizations.
President Stremlau, in his 4nnual
report, recommended again that the
per capita tax of six cents per mem
ber be reduced . to three cents per
member per quarter, he believing that
organizations that do not now -report
fully membership would do so and
the income would be increased. x
He said that great progress had
been made during the year in estab
lishing the shorter work day and that
the old custom of working employes
10, hours or more a day is being done
away with.
He urged all wage earners to unite
for the attainment of the eight-hour
day. ,
President Stiftemlau made a plea for
the union label and also said it was
the duty of trades unionists to demand
the use of buttons of the trades that
have adopted them. Let your slogan
be "Is It Union Made? Where Is the
Union Label?"
In the way of legislation. President
Stremlau said that the widespread use
of Injunctions by the courts against
labor organizations during the year
brought the matter of tepeal of sec
tion 1296 into the very forefront of
all legislation needed.
Amendment to the compensation
law was also most urgent, he claimed.
The waiting period of 10 days before
compensation begins should be re
moved, the present rate of 60 per cent,
should be chanced to at least 66 2-3
per cent; another effort should be
made to create a state insurance fund
so as to make the law more bcneflqlal
r.ot only to employe but also to the
employer. Another important mat
ter is that there should be enacted a
section which will clearly state that
the occupation or industrial diseases
must come within the scope of the
compensation law. v
A bill should be Introduced In the
