PRESIDENT RIPLEY WAS HERE
Many Officials Came From the
Chicago Offices.
Honorary Pall Bearers Included
Widely Known Men.
With hundreds of railroad officials
and employes from all parts of the
west In attendance: with a great pro
fusion of floral tributes and the
church crowded to its utmost capacity,
and hundreds more on the outside,
the last rites were said this afternoon
at 3 o'clock for C. W. Kouns, general
manager for the Santa Fe, who died
here Sunday morning-- The services
were held in the First Methodist
church and were conducted by Dr. A.
S. Embree, for years a personal friend
of Mr. Kouns. There were wagon
loads of floral offerings.
Prominent among the great mass of
flowers was
reproduction of the
oldest engines on the Santa Fe line :
done in asters and roses, witn asters . j? Dillon. Dr. J. if. faster ana tne en
predominating. The original engine Is j tire official staff of the Santa Fe
No. 62. that number being the same as shops and offices including: E. L.
Mr. Kouns's age. It was the tribute
of the locomotive and shops force.
The most pathetic offering was the
chair given to Mr. Kouns years ago
by his co-workers which was sitting
among the offerings completely cov
ered with roses and gladiolas, the
tribute of the general manager's of
fice here.
A broken wheel in flowers was the
offering of the engineer's office. The
Pullman porters were represented by a
great spray of American beauty roses.
Every division on the road was repre
sented in the floral offerings.
The Kansas City division was repre
sented by a great Santa Fe trademark
which was seven feet high and seven
feet wide. In front of the altar was
a massive bank of roses, the tribute
of the Chicago offices. The number of
individual offerings ran into the hun
dreds. At 3 o'clock this afternoon the
church was filled, 500 persons were
lined on the outside and between 2.000
and 4,000 Santa Fe employes were on
their way to the church.
The majority of the attendance, of
course, came from the Topeka offices
and shops which were closed all this
afternoon. Several other offices over
the system were closed. The attend
ance was not by any means comprised
whollv of railroad men Hundreds of
Topeka business men and business
men from other cities were there. By

Kouns began his career as a rallroau jg'j-Jr e McBride J M Brink
man. There were men who knew him s- Lea M.Br.l : ,M1 m
as a brakeman. on the old Kansas Pa
cific, in 1871, and there were men
who knew him as a diplomat and man
of affairs in conferences and near
lngs before scores of corporation
boards before which he represented
his railroad.
During his carter Mr. Kouns has
been connected with several railroads
and it is needless to say men who
knew him on all of them were at the
services.
The great crowd in tne cnurcn is
perhaps best explained by an ..fficial j
of th Santa Fe who said:
"Mr. Kouns came up to his present
position from the ranks ari he made
friends all along the way."
Services In the church were short.
Darwin Bradley sang two songs which
were followed by a short address by
Dr. A. S. Embree who closed the serv
ices with prayer.
After services the Santa Fe Appren
tice band led the funeral cortege to
Topeka cemetery. The line moved
south on Harrison street to Ter.th
avenue and then to Topeka cemetery,
in this formation:

A Veteran Pays Tribute.
Among the men who are in Topeka
to do honor to the memory of C. W.
Kouns is CaPt. W. A. (Bill) Brown of
Weatherford, Texas.
The captain is a Confederate vet
eran, a member of the Fourth Ala
bama, and according to his own story,
the sole surviving private of that regi
ment. "I first knew Charlie Kouns in 1877,
when we were both with the Interna
tional & Great Northern railroad at
Palestine, Texas," said the captain.
"Charlie was chief dispatcher and 1
was employed in the office of the gen
eral freight agent.
"It was not long before I was sent
to Marques, Texas, as agent. In those
days deer were plentiful in Texas and
Charlie Kouns used to loan me his
Kouns.
IN MEMOKIAJt
There was laid to rest in the Topeka
cemetery this afternoon, the body of
a man who was a man among men in
all stations of life. The late C. W.
Kouns, who was general manager of
the Atchison-, Topeka & Santa Fe Sys
tem, proper, at the time of his death,
wore, it is true, the "brass collar" that
has been proverbial for so long In the
railroad world, but he had worked his
way Into it from the bottom of the
railroad ladder, as most of the big
railroad men of this country have
done. And altho he eventually be
came one of the highest and most
important officials of a large railway
organization, he continued, as he al
ways had been, a railroad man among
railroad men. He was as popular with
section hands as he was with his as
sociates in administrative capacities;
and he carried this same popularity
with him outside the railroad world.
There is much substance to a man of
whom every one spoke well while he
was alive. And while Shakespeare
may have sounded a human chord that
generally rings true when he observed
in effect that the good a man does is
oft interred with his bones, there are,
of course, striking exceptions to such
a rule of life and death. Mr. Kouns.
alive end dead, is assuredly one of
them. The world is much the gainer
that he lived in it. The Santa Fe is
much the better railroad that he work
ed on it. And much of his work, his
good work, as almost all of it was,
will live after him and be a monument
to his memory that few humans are
able -to earn.
Winchester to go hunting. After a
successful hunt, I used to send a deer
to Charlie at Palestine.
"From the business association of
that day there sprang a friendship
that has endured thruout the years.
"We only worked together for a
few years, after which Charlie went
with the Southern Pacific and I came
to the Santa Fe where I have been
ever since. Charlie Kouns was a man
of kind and sweet disposition. There
was never a better man drew the
breath of life. Always considerate of
others he never knew such a thing as
class distinction. He was the same to
all men whether fellow general man
ager or section laborer. Even back in
the old Palestine days that was hfs
distinguishing trait; the thing that
gained and held the esteem of his fel
lows. "It has been my pleasure to see Mr.
Kouns every year or two. We have
kept up a correspondence that has ever
been a source of pleasure to me. I
have his picture hanging In my office
now.
"I recall one time, several years ago,
when 1 met Mr. Kounu at Fort Worth.
He called me 'Bill,' I greeted him as
'Charlie.' Old Bill Jphnson happened
to be standing near and took me to
task for calling Mr. Kounu "Charlie.'
I said: 'Well, he called me "Bill"
didn't he?'
"We old timers of the Gulf Lines
will long cherish his memory. In his
death the Santa Fe loses one of its
most valuable officers. The com
munity in which he lived loses one of
its best citizen Knowing him and
loving him I tender to his family my
heartfelt sympathy in this hour of be
reavement." WAS AX ABLE OFFICER.
Veteran Gulf Line Official Tells of Mr.
Konns's Early Career.
In speaking of the death of Ir.
Kouns today, L. J. Polk, formerly
vice president of the Gulf. Colorado &
Santa. Fe railroad and now general
agent for the Santa Fe in Galveston,
who is here for the funeral paid this
tribute to the dead general manager:
"Mr. Kouns's death brings no less
loss to the Santa Fe than it does sor
row to his friends especially those
who have known him longest and best.
"It has been my privilege and pleas
ure to know him intimately for more
than thirty years, and I have yet to
hear a single utterance expressive of
other than the highest admiration for
him as a man and for his ability and
untiring energy as a railroad official.
Career Began In Texas.
"He lived in Texas for many years
his first railroad work in the state
being, I believe, with the International
& Great Northern railroad under H.
M. Hoxie's administration as general
manager. He served that road in sev

Bipley Tells of How Late Offi

Western railroads will fight the 8
hour bill, passed by congress In Its
effort to settle the recent trainmen's
wage controversy and avert a strike.
That statement was made today by
E. P. Ripley, president of the Santa
Fe and dean of American railroad
heads, in Topeka. Mr. Ripley, with
forty-three other Chicago officials of
the Santa Fe, arrived here at 12:35
o'clock this afternoon. Seven Kansas
City officials were also on the train.
All attended the funeral of C. W.
Kouns, general manager of the Santa
Fe, who died here Sunday morning.
K. p. Ripley, iean of American Rail
road Presidents, In Topeka Today
to Attend the 1-lincral of v. W.
Kouns.
Mr. Ripley and his party were met
at ''e train by a delegation from the
gei. rai offices here, including E. L.
Copeland, treasurer; H. B. Lautz, gen
eral manager; Frank Jarrell, publicity
manager; it. J. Parker, general super
intendent, and several others.
Mr. Copeland was the first to shaka
hands with Mr. Ripley as he stepped
irom nis car, arter tne train had beer
parked near the station. The Sarta
Fe president is enjoying excellent
health and showed that he is carrying
his 71 years with ease, as he greeted
the delegation from the offices and
several Topeka business men.
Will 'Contest It.
To a reporter, Mr. Ripley stated
tnere was little doubt that the action
of congress in its attempt to settle
the wage dispute will be contested.
The present status of the affair was
termed by Mr. Ripley as "a surrender"
for the railroads.
"You will contest the bill in the
courts," he was asked.
"Yes."
"Will you refuse to observe the law
and let the trainmen go to court or
will you take action in court first?
"That has not been decided."
Speaking of the death of Mr. Kouns,
Mr. Ripley said:
"I was in Washington when Mr.
Kouns became sick. Up to that time
he was in good fighting trim, appar
ently. As soon as word came that he
was ailing, I investigated, and found
that Mr. Kouns feared a recurrence of
the trouble which laid him up three
years ago. Everything possible was
done to keep him quiet until Mr. Ras
ter could reach Washington, and that
was quite a chore, for Mr. Kouns was
strong for staying on the job.
Santa Fe's Loss.
"The Santa Fe has lost a valuable
official, and many Santa Fe men, and
others have lost a good friend."
Immediately upon his arrival here
Mr. Ripley took lunch at the Harvey
house. After that, he and the other
officials went to the office of E. L.
Copeland where they remained until
the funeral at 3 o'clock.'
Officials with Mr. Ripley stated that
business of the Santa Fe and other
western roads is exceptionally, good.
"If it continues." said one, "and if it
will but continue that way railroad net
revenues will go as hiigh as they
should be."
The Chicago party will leave here
on its return trip at 6 o'clock. Imme
diately after the funeral. Mr. Ripley
expects to attend the stockholders' an
nual meeting here October 26.

Atlantic City, Sept. 6. Hundreds of
the nation's most prominent suffra
gists came here today to decide what
attitude to take toward the Republi
cans and Democrats in the presidential
campaign.
The National American Woman suf
frage association called this emergency
convention and invited both Hughes
and Wilson to address It. There is
some indication that, even tno the
convention may not declare positively
in favor of Mr. Hughes, the bulk of
the membership's influence may be
swung to him because he has declared

The convention will last four days.

situation In a ten minute talk.
The question of whether the Nation

of the opening session of the associa

35,000 Miners in This District
Ready to Quit.
Kansas Hardest Hit; Confer
ence Comes to Naught.
Kansas City. Mo., Sept. 6. A big
coal mine strike in Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Arkansas is near. The
sub-committee in conference between
the miners and the coal operators
have split on the "discharge without
cause" clause in the new contract.
Failure to agree was reported to the
general committee this afternoon and
the conference was declared off.
Until the attitude of operators in
the general committee has been
changed by strike developments yes
terday at Pittsburg, Kan., the confer
ence will then disband and a general
strike of from 35,000 to 38,000 men
will follow. The operators have de
cided against inserting in the new con
tract a clause prohibiting the refusal
of work to any members of the United
Mine Workers without cause.
Kansas mines will be hardest hit,
from 12,000 to 13.000 miners being af
fected there. Missouri has about
10,000 miners: Oklahoma 10,000 and
Arkansas from 6,000 to 8,000.
Eight Thousand Already Out.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 6. With
eight thousand union coal miners al

working agreement.
Dissatisfied with the delay in
reaching an agreement the miners at
Pittsburg walked out yesterday, clos
ing down every big mine in the dis
trict except two Santa Fe mines and
Weir No. 31. The men refuse to re
turn to work until a clause is inserted
in their contract providing that union
men cannot be discharged without
cause or without consent of the union.

fielder available. Manager Engle was
able to send a semblance of a regular
lineup against the Drummers in the
opening game of the final local series
with St. Joe this afternoon.
DeFate's ankle is not entirely weil,
but it was said that he would be able
to play and that if careful he should
have no more trouble with it. The
management of the club stated that
an increase in attendance was looked
for during the St. Joe series, and that
it was hoped Topeka fans would re
move the danger of the local club go
ing the way Wichita went by showing
their loyalty during the remainder of
the season.
Jess Tannehill, big league scout, is
here looking over Topeka players who
are subjected to draft and it is re

General Pershing soldiers may Join
the troops of the def cato government
in an offensive campaign to extermin

was the statement of General Funston
this alternoon.
There has been no agreement be

men for a concerted movement againsl
Villa. General Francisco Gonzales,
Carranza commander in northern Chi
huahua already has sent a force
against the bandit for the last report

the occasion arises, the American
commander might take part in the
pursuit. That is up to General Persh

to the issue with its eyes open and
prepared to see it thru.
U. S. Has Many Grievances.
The course decided on legislation
that hits directly back at every dis
crimination pronounced against
American business interests grew out
of thoro consideration by the state
department and other executive de
partments of the probable conse
quence. It is the hope of the administration,
one official said, that the drastic leg
islation enacted may result In putting
an end to the blacklisting policy of
the British government, the discrim
ination against American commerce,
interference with American malls and
embargoes on American products.
W'hile diplomats representing allied
governments here have strongly hint
ed at commercial "reprisals." officials
are inclined to view that such a con
test is not wanted. This country they
believe, holds the upper hand for the
present at least, and would undoubt
edly be better able to endure a condi
tion of non-intercourse.
