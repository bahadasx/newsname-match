Republicans in
Stale Convention
WARM CONTEST FOR THE
GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION
A FULL ATTENDANCE
Relative Strength of Governor Marcus
H. Holcomb, Dennis A. Blakeslee
and Frank E. Healy is Said to Be
Nearly Equal.
New Haven, Conn., Sept. 6. The re-,
publican convention which will to
morrow place in the field a state tick
et and rame a candidate for United
States senator, held its first session in
Shubert's theatre tonight. Aside from
the keynote speech by Senator Frank
B. Brandegee, the interest was cen
tered upon the governorship. This ab
sorbed the attention of delegates be
fort they listened to the senior sena
tor's address and afterwards. Well
into the night grou.os of men stood in
hotel lobbies or in the headquarters
of the rival candidates and discussed
the outlook.
Candidates for Governor.
Everything pointed to a convtntion
in which there would be no absentee
tomorrow and much excitement over
the balloting. On every hand the opin
ion was held that the relative strength
of Governor Marcus H. Holcomb for
renomination contrary to precedent,
Dennis A. Blakeslee and Frank E.
Healy, was nearly equal, with a good
ly number of votes to go to Lieutenant
Governor Wilson of Bridgeport and
Comptroller Webster of Harwinton.
The general prediction was that the
candidate to win would benefit by a
break in the lineup about the third
ballot. -
No Picture of Hughes.
The convention's opening was a
quiet one. The theatre floor and first
balcony seats were about all filled. In
the latter were many equal suffrage
advocates. The atmosphere was cool
and delegates found it easy to listen
to the keynote speech which took Mr.
Brandegee an hour and a quarter to
deliver. The decorative effects in the
theatre were portraits of Former Pres
idents Grant, Lincoln, McKinley and
Roosevelt and Senator McLean, each
flanked with fiag3, while on the stage
setting at the rear was a likeness of
Former President Taft. No picture of
Mr. Hughes was seen.
It was about S.20 when State Chair
man J. Henry Roraback presented
Senator Brandegee as temporary
chairman and the latter, as a fore
word, said that he had presided at
three conventions wherein the candi- 1
date heading the ticket was "triumph- !
antly elected."
The - speech - euded, J. H. King of
Bridgeport offered a resolution where
by Sabin S. Russell was made secre
tary of the convention and John Buck
ley and W. A. Countryman, all legis
lative clerks, were, made assistants.
The committees, made up of a mem
ber from each senatorial district, were
read and meeting .places appointed.

The resolutions committee which
took up the task of writing a plat
form, and giving ear to a delegation
of women -who wanted a suffrage

Actual Work Begins Today.
After the convention adjourned un
til 10 a. m. tomorrow, when the actual
work of putting the ticket Into the
running will begin, the several com
mittees met. The permanent organi
zation will be the same as the tem
porary one; the rules committee had
no business and the credentials com
mittee accepted the temporary roll.
The resolutions committee took Room
117, the Yale football coaches' quar
ters, for their meeting place and
heard various ones who had sugges
tions to make.
The convtntion work tonight clears
the way for proceeding with the nomi
nations at the outset tomorrow and
the question of making nominating
and seconding speeches was to be
threshed out. Many delegates thought
the speeches could be eliminated in
view of the active canvass which has
been waged for months past. Aside
from the governorship, opinion in
clined to the belief that all other state
officers will be re-ncminatlon as will
Senator McLean and that the ipTatform
will praise the administration of Gov
ernor Holcomb and point out the
achievements of the republican legis
lature. There will be re-alflrmation
of national platform principles.

Declares the Mexican Situation is Re
sult of a Mass of Blunders and In
competance Asserts That Hughes
Will Correct Current Abuses.
New Haven, Conn., Sept. 5. The
foreign policies of the democratic ad
ministration were described as ineffec
tive and incompetent by United States
Senator Frank B Brandegee In his ad
dress here tonight as temporary chair
man of the republican state conven
tion. The election of Charles Evans
Hughes as president was predicted,
with the statement that his election
"will be a guarantee of peace, pro
gress, and prosperity."
Whole Mexican Situation a Blunder.
Referring to the Mexican situation,
Senator Brandegee said that "in the
management of the entire Mexican
question, this democratic administra
tion stands indicted beforo the bar
of public opinion of the grossest
blundering, shuffling and incompe
tence." Scores Democratic Tariff Bill.
He declared, that ' the democratic
tariff bill was a "terrific blew dealt
to the industries of the LTnited States,"
in that it provided no protection for
American labor against conditions to
follow the European war; held that
the "rural credits system" is "so com
plicated, toii-heavy and expensive that
it will prove of little or noavail" and
condemned as "the two reatest men
aces to the country,'' what he termed
the "constantly increasing power and
assumption of the president and the
cowardly subserviency of congress."
Hughes Will Correct Abuses.
Senator Brandegee declared that
Mr Hughes as president, "will cor
rect current abuses, command the con
fidence of business, elevate the diplo
matic service, protect American citi
zens in their rights all over the world,
restore our prestige abroad and main
lain the honor of the nation."
SUFFRAGISTS PARADED
NEW HAVEN STREETS.
One of the Most Impressive Demon
strations of Its Kind Ever Held in
State.
Xew Haven, Conn., Sept. 5. On the
eve of the republican state convention,
suffragists from many parts of Con
necticut paraded through decorated
streets in the center of the city late
today in one of the most impressive
demonstrations of its kind ever held
in the state. It is estimated that more
than 1.500 marchers in vari-cclored
costumes were in line and many rode
in automobiles which were trimmed in
suffrage colors. 'Nearly every one
carried a banner of some kind, and
many of the placards bore legends
praising Charles E. Hughes for his
stand on the suffrage question.
A "(t. O. P. elephant" was one of the
features. One group of young wom
en attired in striking gowns of Stars
and Stripes received a continuous ova
tion. Most of the marchers were
women, but here and there mere man
paraded and always he was greeted
with vigorous cheering.
The procession was reviewed by city
officials and prominent suffragettes at
the city hall. The streets were lined
with thousands of persons who accord
ed the marchers generous applause.
ITALIAN LINER WAS
CHASED BY A SUBMARINE.
Six Men Shot and Stabbed in Riot on
Board the Giuseppe Verdi.
' (New York, Sept. 5. The Italian liner
Giuseppe Verdi, which arrived today
from Naples and other Mediterranean
ports, reported being chased by a sub
marine; off the Moroccan coast on Aug.
24 last.
Passengers on the Verdi said there
were daily scenes of turbulence among
300 American hostlers returning here
from Italian ports where they had
gone with cargoes of horses for the
Italian army. .When the ship was in
mid-ocean the disorder culminated in
a riot in which six men were shot and
stabbed and two others were placed in
irons, charged with assault. Four" of
the injured were able to leave the
ship's hospital when she reached
quarantine. The condition of the
others was said to be serious.
The men in irons were to be turned
over to the police, officers of the Verdi
said.
HEAVY BUYING CAUSES
PRICE OF VHEAT TO RISE.
In Some Cases the Advance Amounted
to 6 1-2 Cents a Bushel.
Chicago, Sept. 5. Heavy buying on
the part of some of the largest houses
on 'change forced the value of wheat
sharply higher today. In seme cases
the advance amounted to 6 1-2 cents
a bushel, the September delivery
touching 151 1-2 as against 145 at the
close on Saturday.
Although the settlement of the rail
way strike was partly responsible, at
tention chiefly centered on a state
ment by a leading expert that the con
dition of the domestic epring crop at
harvest was the lowest ever known.
According to another authority, the
1916 crop in the United States was
25.000,000 bushels under bread ' and
seed requirements, and allowed no
surplus for export.

Border Conditions Are to Be Dealt
With First Secretary Lane is Ad
vocating Free Exchange of Views
Without Formality.
New London, Conn., Sept. 5. Mem
bers of the American-Mexican joint
commission arrived here late today
aboard the presidential yacht Mayflow-'
er, prepared to enter tomorrow upon
the conference from which the Wash
ington administration hopes will come
a mutual understanding upon which
future relations between the two gov
ernments can be founded. The party
left New York early, making a leisure
ly trip, the commissioners employing
their time in getting acquainted with
each other. They dined tonight aboard
the Mayflower and did not go ashore
to the hotel at Groton, across the river
at New London, where the conferences
will be held, until long after dark.
Cabrera Will Preside.
Luis Cabrera, Mexican minister
finance and Jiead of the commission
named by General Carranza, will pre
side at the first meeting, which will ba
held tomorrow morning. Secretary
Lane, heading the American commis
sion, will conduct the following ses
sion, and the two will alternate as
presiding officer thereafter. Tho
American commissioners are anxious
to give the conference as informal a
character as possible. Secretary Lane
believes that more can be accomplish,
ed through a free exchange of idefjj
among the six men to whom has been
assigned the task of clarifying the re
lations between tho two governments
than could be hoped for from a formal
presentation by each side of its de
sires. Border Conditions Come First.
In accordance with General Carran
za's preferences, as expressed in his
last, communication during the nego
tiations which led to the naming of the
commission, the immediate question fo
border military conditions will be first
discussed. It seems likely that the
withdrawal, of General Pershing's
troops from Mexico, the main object
which the Mexican commissioners have
been instructe dto press, and the terms
of the protocol to cover future cam
paigns against bandits, will be coupled
together. If an agreement is reached
by the eommisrioners it must be rati
fied both in Washington and Mexico
City before, it can become ..effectiee.
and it is improbable that the terms of
any such agreement will be disclosed
until it has been approved.
