will be held today. The remains iwere
taken to W'aurika and shipped from
that point The deceased was 72
years of age but was very active and
was an excellent busrness man. He
had accumulated a fortune worth
probably as much as $200,000.
His son Burrell Grlrfls, aged about
years was working with him for
wages. At about 8:30 Monday morn-
ng when father and son were niak

armed with a knife. Durrell Griffis

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS DE
CIDE YESTERDAY THAT EVERY
MILE CONSTRUCTED IN FU
TURE BE HARD SURFACE.
By unanimous vote of tho county
commissioners yesterday afternoon
all money spent for roads In Carter
county In tlie future will be on per
manent hard surface roads.
Tills action was taken when tlie
Good Roads Committee of the chain
her of commerce beaded by Charles
Von Welse held a conference with
the county officials and pledged their
support and co-operation in tho mat
ter of road building.
Probably a score of farmers from
various parts of the county were at
the meeting and all endorsed the uc
tion of the board.
Practically all emergency work has
been completed and with the gross
production tax there Is no alterna
tive but to proceed iwltu permanent
construction.
The local committee did not ask
for any special road on which this
money was to be spent. They con
sidered that since permanent roads
was the law and the commissioners
the men to enforce that law that Ard
more would be satisfied with tlie
work they did so long as it was per
manent. Mr. Von Weise was spokes
man and point d out how this gross
production money was directed to be
spent under the law and said that the
farmers were Just as much interested
in the matter as the town people and
that they needed the hard roads and
would expoct them.
"We are not here for any other
purpose than to tell you that Ardmore
will be satisfied with your work If
you build permanent roads and build
them anywhere on any road, but let
your constituents know that you are
beginning a system wnich with this
gross production money ill give
them real roads in a few years. The
farmers know we have always re
sponded and we will do It again and
again. It will not be long before
there will not be any emergencies
and Carter county will have the best
roads In the state."
