Germans Admit Russian Gains
Along the Hungarian
Frontier
By Wilbur S. Forrest. "
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Sept. C. A bold German
stroke, aiming at the early capture of
Bucharest, capital of Rumania, was re
vealed in dispatches from Berlin to
day.
The Germaus and Bulgarians have
concentrated artillery and men against
-the strongly fortified Rumanian bridge-
htad at Tutrakan on the Danube, only
4M miles southeast of Bucharest, lue
German war. office this afteruoon an
nounced the capture of seven Rumanian
works near Tutrakan following the oc
cupation of advanced positions an
nounced yesterday.
Tutrakan lies at the end of a railway
lending along a river vallev directly
to Bucharest. The Germans, it is be
lieved here, bone to cross the Danube,
strike down this valley and inflict a
severe blow on. the morale of the Ru
manian people by seizing their capital,
while the mniu Russian army is invad
ing Transylvania.
Bucharest dispatches, however, assert
tbnt the southern frontier is well pro
tected and that Bucharest is in no dan
ger from that direction. The Rumanian
war office today announced the repulse
of the German-Bulgarian invaders ev
erywhere on the Dobrudja frontier and
reported the capture of another Tran
sylvanian town. . .
On the Somme battle front the allies
won further victories in last night '
fighting. The British captured the
whole of Lense wood, pushing their ad
vance to within a mile of Combles while
French troops are already at the out
skirts of that strongly fortified town.
The German war office this afternoon
admitted for the first time the loss of
Clery to General Foch's troops.
The Russian war office announced
' further progress near the Hungarian
frontier and the. loss of ground in that
region was admitted at Berlin. The
lnvs have taken 4,500 prisoners in
fighting around Halitz.
Germans Losing Spirit.
I'nris, Sept. 6. Repeated German at
tacks against the newly won French
positions south of the Somme were brok
en up by French barrage fire last night,
it was officially announced today.
The German assaults reached their
greatest violence at Deniecourt and
Berny-en-santerre. North of the Somme
the Germans made no counter attack
during the night but artillery was ac
tive on all points.
The lack of spirit displayed by the
Germans in counter attacks of the Inst
two days offers evidence, according to
French military men, of the severe
shock to the German morale of the Anglo-French
viotories in this week's
fighting on the Somme.
The second anniversary of the begin
ning of the battle of the Marne which
turned the German tide from the gates
of Paris was celebrated here today
while Paris took stock of the new suc
cesses on the Somme. The principal
celebration, however, will be held next
Sunday.

Cause of Trouble Coining
Between Them
Chicago, Sept. 0. Mrs. James R.
Barnes, whose husband was found dead
with three bullets in his body in Wash
ington Park last night, early today
confessed to killing him, according to
police, "because he refused to live with
her any more." Barnes was the Chi
cago agent of a New York soap con
cern. "I asked him to withdraw his di
vorce euit and he refused," police de
clare she said. "We quarreled and I
shot him two or three times, r don 't
know just how many. After that my
I mind became a blank. V
j Mrs. Barnes made her reported con
fession afte a six hour grilling by po
lice.
Barnes was found dead by a park
policeman. MrB. Barnes was standing
over the body wringing her hands and
crying:
"He shot himself; he shot himself."
I Mrs. Barnes told police that her hus
band had sued her because he found
I her with another man in their apart-
I ments. She told the police the man
hnd caught her parrot and had asked
to come in and wash his hands. She told
him he could, and, according to her
account he turned suddenly, grabbed
her and carried her into the next room.
Just then her husband came, home and
found them in the house. That was the
beginning of their trouble, she said.
"I did it. T fired tho shot. I killed
him," snid Mrs. Barnes, according to
police.
"I wanted him to withdraw his di
vorce suit. He refused and when I
begged him, he raised his fist and I
thought he was going to hit me. So I
drew a revolver from my purse and
shot him. T don't know how many
times I fired.'
Barnes had been shot three times.
Mrs. Barnes will not be booked until
after the inquest which will be held
this afternoon.

SHARP CONFLICT
E
Administration Will Hit Back
at Every Act of Dis
. crimination
COMMERCIAL REPRISALS
STRONGLY HINTED AT
Law Places Weapons In Pres
ident's Hands with which
to Strike
Washington, Sept. G. A sharp diplo
matic conflict between the allied gov
ernments and the United States is ex
pected to follow retaliatory measures
incorporated in the revenue bill passed
by the senate late last night. With
agreement to the amendments by the
house conference committee anticipated
today, it is thought the allied govern
ments probably led by Gtrat Britain,
maj begin shaping counter retaliations.
The belief of many officials, how
ever, is that the conflict will be strict
ly commercial.
It was said on the other hand that
the United States government is going
into the "issue with Its eyes open and
prepared to Bee it through. The course
decided on legislation that hits direct
ly back at every discrimination pro
nounced against American business in
terests grew out of thorough considers
tion by the state department and other
executive departments of the probable
consequences, it was declared today.
It is the hope of the administration
one official snid, that the drastic legis
lotion enacted may result in putting an
end to the blacklisting policy of the
oritiRD government, the discrimination
against American commerce,- interfer
ence with American mails and embar
goes on American products.
While-diplomats representing allied
governments here have strongly hinted
at commercial " reprisals,'. ' officials are
inclined to view that such a contest is
not wanted. This country, they believe,
noiuB tne upper n and for the present at
least, and would undoubtedly be bet
ter auie to enuure a condition or non
intercourse.
The effect of the new legislation will
depend in large part on the degree to
which President Wilson chooses to util
ize it. Heretofore he has been without
weapons with which to strike back
against alleged unfair trade practices.
Once the new measures are law he will
have very definite powers the employ
ment of the land and naval forces being
speeiricaiiy authorized for enforcement
of the provisions of the revenue act
amendments.
The president is permitted to carrv
forward the retaliatory measure until
reciprocal liberty of commerce and
equal facilities of trade have been re
stored.

(United Press staff correspondent)
r.i raso, Texas, sept, ti. " Villa is
rapidly looming up as a menacing fac
tor in northern Mexico," said a high
military otrmal today, after receiving
from secret service men reliable infor
mation that Villa with one thousand
men was hiding in Santa Clara canvon
"It was said, and it was true a short
time ago, continued the military au
thority, "that he was not a factor in
the situation. No doubt he is timing
his latest activities for their effect
upon negotiations by the American
Mexican border commission.
"Carranaa troops are letting-Villa
severely alone since he whipped them
badlv several times recently. The ban
dit chief knows that if American troops
move south toward him it will put Car
ranza in a position where he will be
compelled to order tbem to bait, or
to back down before his own people.
Scouts have been sent out from Gen
ernl PerBhing's outposts to determine
the position and strength of Villa's
forces, according to reports from Co

Imaginary Husbands
Give Wrong Impressions
Stanford University, Cal., Sept. 8
Men of the university are up in arms
against the imaginary husbands of the
women in the home economics depart
ment, who this year are managing the
financial affairs of imaginary families
on an imaginary income. The men say
these pjiantom husbands will give the
women the wrong idea of life, as they
will allow their wives to go where they
please, with whom they please, when
they please, have no place in the home
except the bringing in of the necessary
income, have no allowance for smoking
costs, and must let their wives even
select and pay for their clothes. .
The idea of "imaginary Husbands
was introduced by Dr. Jessica Peixotto,
in charge of the home economics de
partment as a practical way to teach
girls to live within an average income.

Japan's Demands On China If
Conceded ' May Prove
Dangerous
Washington, Sept. 6. Inquiries will
be made immediately by Ambassador
Guthrie at Tokio and Minister Reinsch
at Peking, regarding Japan's newde-
mands on -China, the state department
announced today. The published de
mands, although they have not reached
the stats department officially are con
tinued by private advices to officials.
The only one of the demands which
may possibly interfere with American
interests, it is said, is that requiring
Japanese police powers in inner Mon
golia - and Southern Manchuria.' . The
extent of these powers will determine
whether or not the United States will
be affected.
Commenting on the latest develop
ments in Japanese relations with China,
a caginet official said:
"The only thing which greatly' in
terests the United States in this situs,-
tion is whether -or -vnt .this country's
trade Tights are to be jeopardized.
Japan has repeatedly given, us assur
ances that no matter what attitude, or
action or negotiations she took, or car
ried on with China, there, would bo no
interference with the open door in any
policy." i

Word has been sent to the State La
bor Commission O. P. lloff, that 30,
000 farm hands are wanted in western
Cauadd to harvest the immense crop
there, and that a day and board are
paid. The Canadian government
through its agents is offering low rail
road rates' from all boundary points,
and the announcement is made that
there is no conscription and absolute
ly no military interference. The points
where labor infgormatiou is furnished
are Winnipeg, Kegina, North Portia,
Saskatoon, Ft. Frances. Kings Gute, B.
C; Coutts, Calgary, Alberta.
Chicago experts have estimated that
tho entire wheat erop of the northwest
will be less than half a crop. Farm
hands who left Oregon to work in the
wheat harvest of Minnesota have sent
word to the commissioner of labor of
Oregon, thut while wages are good
there, the crop is short. That thousands
of acres in Minnesota . will not yield
over 12 bushels to the acre. That there
are fields that will not pay for the
harvesting. The commissioner is also
the recipient of Broomhull's estimate
for the year ending August 1, 1017, in
which he says that the impart demand
for wheat in Europe by countries ac
cessible to the United States will reach
52,000,000 bushels, but should the war
end before that time the demand will be
832,000,000 bushels.

His Career
New York, Sept. 6. Groping for a
clue to the identity of two masked
men who shot and killed Attorney
Dwight Dilworth as he sat in an auto
mobile with a young woman companion
in VanCortlundt Park Sunday night, the
police had detained and were question
ing three men today.
Bernard Decio, aged 21, was arrested
early today near the scene of the mur
der. Tony Garina was arrested in Mt.
Vernou fallowing a hold-up there, and
George Teyden, who was with Gudina
at the time of his arrest, is also held.
Stories began to come to light today
of Mlworth's life on Broadway. The
police were told he had a wide acquaint
ance in theatrical circles. They were
also told of Dilworth 's fondness for
women, which ended in his forced with
drawal from a firm here. Whether
some enemy made in his Bohemian life
was responsible for his dcuth is a new
anglo being investigated by the police
while the clue thut he was a victim of
blackmailers is still being run dowu.
New York, Sept. 0. Detectives to
day turned to the white lights of Broad
way In hopes that they may cast some
light on the murder of Dwight Dil
worth, lawyer, in "lovers lane", Van
Cortland Park, Sunday night.
Thut Dilworth was well known along
Broadway and in its resortB, became
known when "Dolly" Rogers, an act
ress, said she hail introduced Dilworth
to Mary McXiti, who was his compan
ion on the night of crime.
Jealousy of some of Broadway's
women is being put forwanl as a pos
sible cause for the murder.
"Dollv" Kodgers, however, express
ed the opinion to detectives that "dear
old Dwight" might have been murder
ed by private detectives frightened out
of their caution while trying to get
something on him.
Sari it Waa a Woman

she knows her husband was killed by
a woman and not by robbers, Mrs.

jealousy as the probable motive for his
murder in New York Pundaynight.
"As soon as I received the telegram
I was certain a woman had killed my
husband," she explained. "I will nev
er rest until the true facts are known.
The police hnve been told a lot of lies
concerning Mr. Dilworth and myself, to
make it appear as .if some woman had
come between us. The cause of the
murder Is unknown to me now, but I
am convinced jealousy i back of it.

these two matters wcf up for final

regular meeting last night. The license)

9 to 3, and the speed amendment by a,
voto of 7 to5.
A report from Deupty Health Offi
cer Bryan as to the sanitary condition
of a stock pen belonging to G. W. Eyre
near the Southern Pacific depot was
favorable, but the introduction of the
report started a discussion. Alderman
Cook' stated it to be his understanding
that the pen had been ordered out, and
made a motion that such removal
should be attended to at once. Alder
man McClellan rose to the defense of
the pen, asserting that its removal
would injure Mr. Eyre's business' and
that there exists no good reason for its
removal, inasmuch is its canltaty con
dition is above criticism. "It isn't a
question of sanitaiton," retorted Cook;
"the pen is contrary to city law." At
this juncture Alderman Mills suggested
that the pen be put under injunction,
which caused the laughter it was in
tended to cause, Alderman Ward-lead-'
ing in the expression of hilarity. The)
matter was finally disposed of by" Al
derman Cook, who withdrew his motion
and substituted one to the effect that
the question be referred to ' the city
attorney, to report at the next meet

A communication front P". H..p.'.Are'jr
was read. , Mr. D 'Arcy proposes ty
erect a drinking fountain in front or
his property on Court street if the city
will agree to maintain the same. This
waa referred to the committee on tin
and water.
A letter from Congressman Hawley
to the city attorney was read, in which.
Mr. Hawley states that the fence be
longing to him in University addition
had been moved according to the or
ders of tho council, but that he was
not convinced as to the correctness of
the measurements which in the opin
ion of the street committee made the
removal of the fence necessary.
Stating that the services of a depu
ty health officer are necessary, ami
that the time, for which the present
deputy had been engaged by the coun
cil was almost expired, Alderman Un
roll introduced a motion that he ba
refined until January 1 or until Buci
time as the council sees fit to dispense)
with his services. Alderman Cook here
expressed himself as being favorable to
the retention of the deputy health of
ficer, but he desired some Information
as to what the officer was doing.
"For instance," said he, 'what about
wocdsf I want to hear from the city
attorney as to why the weeds about
town are not cut."
City Attorney Macy thereupon ex
plained as to weeds, a question which
has beon asked by many Salem people,
who have understood that provision
was made in the city regulation! for
the cutting thoreof. "The charter pro
vides," said the attorney, "that the
park board shall have authority to reg
