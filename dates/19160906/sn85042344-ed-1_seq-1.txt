NEW LONDON. Conn., Sept. 5.
Members of the Mexican Joint
commission arrived here late today
from New York aboard the presiden
tial yacht Mayflower prepared to
enter tomorrow on the conlcrelice
from which tho Washington admin
istration hopes will come a mutual
understanding upon which future re

can bo founled.
Luis Cabrera, Mexican minister of

named by General Carranza, will pre
Bide at the first meeting tomorrow
morning Secretary Ijine, heading the
American commission, will conduct
the following session and the two will
alternate as presiding officers there
after. Informal In Tone.
The American commissioners nre
anxious to give the conference as in
formal a character as possible. Sec
retary Ijino believes that more can
be accomplished through a free ex
change of Ideas among the six men
than could be hope for Irom a formal
presentation by each sldo of Its de
sires.
In accordance with General Car
ranzii's preferences the question of
border military conditions will be first
discussed. it seems likely that the
withdrawal of General Pershing's
troops from Mexico, the main object
which the Mexican commissioners
have been instructed to press, and the
terms of the protocol to cover future
campaigns against bandits will be
coupled together.
If an agreement Is reached by the
commissioners it must lie ratified both
in Washington and Mexico City before
It can become effective and it is Im
probable that the terms of any such
agreement will be disclosed until it
has been approved.
