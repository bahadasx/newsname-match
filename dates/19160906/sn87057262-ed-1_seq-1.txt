PAYING PRICE
OF PATRIOTISM
Women and

Girls of England, Who

Factories.

LONDON, Aug. 25—(By mail.)—
Seared by molten metal, blinded by
steel shavings and with fingers
snipped off by the cruel machinery of
the munitions, factories, English
women and girls are paying the price
of patriotism as well as their men at
the front.
Industrial accidents have not dimin
ished despite the claim of labor ex
perts that women are more careful
than men. Their inexperience is be
lieved to account for many of the
accidents so the experts may be right
after all in theory. But theory won't
restore sight nor knead the kinks out
of pitifully mangled hands.
Another explanation is that femin
ine machinists, puddlers, lathe hands,
become preoccupied at their work
when their thoughts flit to the men
fighting in France, the ladle tips or
the belt slips off the rollers, there's
a scream and another casualty goes
down on the growing list.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 6.—De
claring she knows her husband was
killed by a woman and not by rob
bers, Mrs. Grace Dllworth early today
assigned jealousy as the probable mo
tive fbr his murder In New York
Sunday night.
"As soon as I received the telegram
I was certain a woman had killed my
husband," she explained. "I will never
rest until the true facts are known.
The police have been told a lot of lies
concerning Mr. Dilworthi and myself,
to make it appear as if some woman
bad come between us. The cause of
the murder is unknown to me, but I
am convinced jealousy- is back of it."
Under the White Lights.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.—Detectives
today turned to the white lights ot
Broadway in hopes that they may
cast some light on the murder of
Dwlght Dllworth, lawyer, in "lovers
lane" Van Courtland pant, Sunday
night. ...
That Dllworth was well known
along Broadway and In Its resorts be
came known when "Dolly" Rogers, an
actress, said she had introduced Dll
worth to Mary McNiff, who was hia
companion on the night of the crime.
Jealousy of some of Broadway's wo
men is being put forward as a possible
cause for the murder.
"Dolly" Rogers, however, expressed
the opinion to detectives that "dear
old Dwlght" might have been murder
ed by private detectives frightened
out of their caution while' trying to
get something on him.
Three Men Arrested.
NiEJW YORK, Sept. 6—Groping for
a clue to the identity of two masked
men who shot Attorney Dwight P.
Dllworth as he sat in an automobile
with a young woman companion in
Van Cortland Park Sunday night, the
•police had detained and were ques
tioning three men today.
Bernard Decio, 21, -mis arrested
early today near the scene of the
murder. Tony Gadlna was arrested
in Mount Vernon following a holdup
there, and George Teyden, who was
with Gadina at the time of his arrest,
is also held. Stories began to come
to light today of Dilworth's life on
Broadway. The police were told he
had a wide acquaintance in theatrical
circles. They, were also told of Dil
worth's fondness for women, which
ended in his forced withdrawal from
a firm here. Whether some enemy
made in his Bohemian life was re
sponsible for his death, is a new angle
being investigated by the police, while
the clue that he was a victim of
•blackmailers is still being run down.
