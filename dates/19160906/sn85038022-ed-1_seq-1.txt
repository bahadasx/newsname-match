Department.
The school bells chimed merrily
yesterday iiiornlnK alter 1.. simeil
for ten weeks and the opening of the
1M-17 term of school began very
auapicioualy. All the teachers report
a good enrollment for the first dnv
although It will not compare with the
yearly enrollmeul.
The following is the enrollment by
schools:
First District 107
High School Building 16M
High School 21S
Forest Avenue f16
Sixth Ward 68
Colored 15
The Increase In the Sixth Ward was
good but In all the other schools the
attendance was as usual. The great
eat Increase was In the High School
department where 218 were enrolled
on the first day as compared with 196
on last year. Superintendent Capllng
er was well pleased with the enroll
ment of the day.
Although the number of children In
the city of Maysville Is considerably
less at present than It was several
years ago the schools still hold up,
particularly the High. School. This
can be accounted for In the following
manner. The High School Is now
made so Interesting for the pupil with
athletics, literary societies, etc., that
pupils that would ordlnarly drop out
now stay because of these things
Then the High School offers a great
variety of subjects which a pupil can
take and thus fit himself for something
better. The High School this year has
a great number of out-of-town stu
dents, despite the fact that two now
consolidated schools have been built
In the county. Pupils are coming from
Vanceburg, Mt. Carmel, Ohio and all
the towns In the county.
The senior class as enrolled yester
day numbered 60, the largest ever in
the history of the schools. Several
may drop but at least 45 will gradu
ate. The outlook for this term Is ex-

BIG MERGER
Of the First National and Standard
Rank of This City Name to Re
The Flrat-SUndard Rank
Change Will Re Made
Soon.
The business of the First National
and Standard Banks, of this city, will
be merged Into one concern, and as
soon as the necessary legal stepa can
be perfected, Maysville will have the
largest and most modern and up to
date financial Institution in North
eastern Kentucky. About thirty days
will be necessary to complete and per
fect the new organization. In the
meantime, each of said Banks will
continue their business as heretofore
A new corporation will be formed,
under the laws of the State of Ken
tucky. It will be a combined Bank and
Trust Company, with a capltol stock
of $175,000.00. Name, Flrat-Standanl
Rank and Trust Company of Maysville,
Ky.
The business will be conducted in
the building now occupied by the First
National Bank, The Standard moving
thereto. Some changes will be made
In the new banking room, including .1
new front and entrance to the Bank.
Twelve thousand dollars worth of
the stock of the new Bank and Trust
Company will be sold to the public at
$210 per share and samo has already
been over subscribed at that price,
which shows the degree of confi
dence and popularity with Which the
new venture Is meeting.
The combined assets of the con
cern will be about $1,600,000.00, Its de
posits will be over $1,000,000.00 and it
Is the confident prediction of Its of
ficers that within a short time Mays
vllle will be enjoying, in this new
concern, a two million dollnr Hank
and Trust Company.
It will do a general banking am!
trust business, which means that it
will be able to extend to its patrons
every facility and accommodation that
Ja or can be given by any financial
institution. The large amount of its
capital and surplus will enable It to
make larger loans and take care of
and handle bigger financial projects
than any financial Institution of this
city or section of the state has ever
been able to do. It will put Maysville
on the financial map.
It will pay 3 per cent interest upon
savings accounts, and have a vacation,
Christmas and similar club depart
ment. It will give special attention
to commercial accounts, lend money
on personal notes and collaterals and
make a specialty of farm and real es
tate loans. It will act as Kxecutor,
Administrator, Guardian, Curator, As
signee, Committee, Agent and in every
capacity in which a Trust Company
can serve the public. It will, in fact,
be so organized and equipped that an
account may be opened in it for a new
born babe, kept at interest until he or
she reaches the age of responsibility,
converted into a business account,
carried as such during the life of the
individual and at his or her death em
powered to administer upon his or her
estate if they so desire. In other
words, it will be an entirely complete
financial institution, right up to the
minute.
The officers will be Hon. J. N. Ke
hoe. President; Thoa. A. Keith, S. P.
Browning, L. O. Maltby, Vice Presi
dents; J. B. Durrett, Cashier; James
E. Threlkeld, Assistant Cashier. The
Directory will be composed of fifteen
members and embrace the well known
gentlemen of the present Directories
of the Standard and First National
Banks.
This leaves Maysville with only one
National Bank, the State National, and
gives It three strong Stute Hanks the
Farmers & Traders, the Bank of Mays
ville and the First-Standard with these
four powerful financial institutions
this city will be able to hold its high
standing in the financial world that it
tiHa heretofore enjoyed.
The gentlemen who will be lu
charge of the bank are well-known to
every resident in Maysville and Ma
son county and are liked because of
their old-fashioned Kentucky courtesy
and manners and for their willing
ness to lend a helping hand when call
ed upon. These men have been in the
banking business for many years and
thoroughly understand every phase of
financing.
