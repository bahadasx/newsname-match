Regular attendance means more to
the child than most people think. We
hope to have an unusually gO$d year
this session and invite the ooperation
of parents and good citizens.
The board has employed a corps ol
sixteen very strong teachers. These
teachers, some strangers, but all
with excelleht preparation, are going
to give the schools good service. All
we ask is that the public do its part
and the school will surely do its part.
This community in the past has been
unanimously in favor of good schools,
As a result your schools have made
progress. With continued support,
tne scnoyis win wuw gicawi yiusidSf'
gress.
All children who have no promo-**
tion cards or entrance cards to
grades above the fourth will report

Towards the close of last session,
some children would loiter op the

/ forbidden both by school rules and
jthe city ordinances.
vParents are cordially invited to
visit the class rooms often. They
should also get acquainted with their
children's teachers, and tell the
teacher and the Superintendent of
any defects that the child might
have. It will mean a great deal to
both teacher and child. Co-operation
, \ i? the "key-word" for this next session.
- The child's good is the chief thing
that we have in view, and to accomplish
this we will expect a continued
loyal suport of the parents and

COOPER MEN RALLY
TO MANNING'S SIDE
for Governor
Whose 'Vote Will Decide Next EI-.
ection Comes Out Very Strongly
for the Re-Election of Governor
Manning and His Leaders All Over
the State Pledge Him Their Very
Active Support.
Laurens, Aug. 31.?The Hon. Robert
A. Cooper last night gave the following
statement relatives to the
gubernatorial race: "I am deeply
grateful to Che many friends in all
sections of the state who gave me
their support in Tuesday's primary.
Notwithstanding the loyal support of
true and tried friends, I have 'been
defeated and the second primary will
be had with Gov. Manning and former
Governor Blease as contestants.
Among those who gave me their support
are from supporters of these
two gentlemen and I am not unmindful
of their preferences. I recognize
the right of every citizen to cast his
ballot for the man of his choice, I
know, too, that I have some friends
who think I should make no statement
at all at this time, and I respect
[ their judgment highly, but I cannot
and do not propose to evade a stand
for what I conceive to be. the best
interest of my state. Without attempting
to give my reasons In detail,
I believe I can best serve my state
at this time by supporting Governor
Manning. ; A man 'in public life
should act according to the dictates
of his conscience and judgment without
regard to the effect which his
course may'have upon his p&gonal
political future, and should also forget
any wrong which may have been
done him when what he conceived as i
his duty to his state is at stake. I do
not presume to dictate to the friends
who voted, for me. They have a sovereign
right to their ballot. I make
this statement as to myself for the
reason set forth above and further '
that I may not be accused of political
cowardice or of sulking in my tent"
? ' '
CARD FROM A. H. DAGNALL.
I wish to thank those who so loyally
supported me for Congress, and
I regret that it will be impossible
for me to see a!nd thank every voter
personally. I shall always feel
grateful to those who considered me
worthy to represent them in Congress.
A. H. Dagnall.

Miss Belle Thomson has come to

the most widely known and most
successful welfare workers in the
state and Abbeville is fortunate in
having her come here. She will
make her home in the Superintendent's
house at the mill village, with
her sister, Miss Cora Thomson, who
will teach the mill school. Miss
Thomson is pretty enough to look
after the welfare of some good lookng
young man. Many of our young
men are clamoring for her to take
some notice of them, even to reading
the Bible to them on a moonlight
night, which would be in the way of
uplifting work.

WHY NOT RAISE CATTLE? ft
___ ' r<
Why not make McCormick county ^
the banner cattle raising county of
the State? This we can do if every d
formsr mill Tint his eVlftnlH??T ..ft fVlA P
wheel. |If every fanner who is able ^
would get a registered ctrtv or' two n
aj*d a registered hog or two of the P
best strain, it would only be a few ?
years before we would change our ^
name from the baby county to the a
banner county of the State. Our
grazing lands are as good or really y
better than some of the pasture lands j
that are now growing some of the jj
best registered cattle in the country, v
There are thousands of acres of
waste lands that if fenced in and
the best stock put on it, would bring g,
more in my opinion, than the cotton n
crop of the county w^uld bring, and a
I venture to say at least the profits ?
would be twenty per cent greater. y
Negro labor is a thing of the past n
and the quicker our people realize
this fact and change their methods
of making a living the better'it will ,
be for them. I was talking to a 1
gentleman several week3 ago in the I
eastern part of the state that said i,
sixteen years ago he realized negro t]
labor was gone, so far as making e
money out of him, was concerned. 0
He wired in his eleven hunded acres, a
went west and bought a car of Here- t<
ford cattle, put these on his lands,
let cotton and negroes go, and today M
* ? ?* nrAnHlil Afti- ?MAM ll
IIC IS Uiic ui tuc wcaiuucou in^n aim \,t
his county with a couple of hundrec r
of as good cattleas can be foun< e
anywhere.
Greenwood county bought nin i
thousand dollars worth of registere<
cattle lkst fall and the most of thesi
were bought by men who have beei d
in the business for some time, ant ^
know a good thing when they see it ^
Greenwood county farmers received u
in prizes at the State Fair last fall, a
some fifteen hundred dollars, and ?
this went to. farmera right around ^
Ninety-Six. a
Our lands are as good, or better,^'
for srrazine purposes. Why not get |\
right down to building fences on our \
vacant lands, get good cattle and
good hogs?sell in place of buying? let
the west go, keep our money at ^
home, and live off the same place.? ^

COSTS LOTS TO HEAR RESULTS .
Telegraph Toll* on Election Results
from El Paso Rather High for the
County Executivfe Committee. ^
Anderson, Sept. 5.?It cost the , :|i
zounty democratic executive commit- /Jjg
tee exactly $83.15 for telegraph tolls
to receive the results of the election J; 'M
from the Anderson county soldiers v
now in camp near El P$so, Texas. /. :||j
Instead of abbreviating the , telegrams ^
the managers of election for the four"* . -fM
military organizations used superflii
ous words, and this ran up the tolls . ^?lf|
to an amount at least twice more v^3
than was necessary. County Ohair- f
man Tolly said today that he sent M
specific instructions to the military ,
organizations about reporting the
results, but that his instructions had
been disregarded. He will furnish r 7: :<?the
organizations blank forms for re- ? * jjpS
porting the results in the second pri- ,v|j
mary election.
There were approximately 125 \
votes cast on the Anderson county
ticket at El Paso, and news of the
* ] * - SH
election results from that place
came pretty high. And one report
that from Co. K. did not arrive by '
telegraph until this morning?too
late to be included in the results because
the county executive committee
has already met and declared the
results. The votes cast by the members
of Co. K. were few and would
jot change the results for any office.
