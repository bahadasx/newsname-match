all roads are in first class condition,
and thousands will avail themselves of
the opportunity to visit the Jubilee

scheduled to visit Manchester on
Thursday, making the trip by auto. All
of the towns of the county, and those
in adjoining counties will be largely
represented at the Jubilee during the
week.

and entertain. Elaborate plans were
made and everything is in readiness.
The grounds have been put in fine
shape, and all conveniences for the
vlaitors have been provided. The H.
W. Campbell United Shows company
arrived in Manchester on Sunday af
ternoon and has its twenty cars of
attractions on the grounds. A large
line of free acts are to be given after

to the farmers, and many horses and
colts have been entered.
Manchester Extends a cordial wel

Back Creek Home Coming.
The pood people of Buck Creek, five
miles west of Hopkinton, are making
elaborate preparation for a great home
coming and fair, to be he'd on Sep
tember 10, 11 and 12, 1916. The home
coming and fair will be conducted
under the auspices of the Methodist
Episcopal church of that community,
and no efforts will be spar ri to make
the event a success. The Buck Creek
church has become prominent during
the last seven years, because of its
unusual work in furthering the social
and religious life of the community.
The Rev. Gilbert J. Chalice, and mem
bers of the church, have proved be
yond doubt that a Really live church
organization is possible in the rural'
communities. The home coming and
fair is enly one of the many avenues
through which the church and social
life of Buck Creek is being developed.
The Home Coming will begin on
Sunday, September 10th, with a ser
mon in the morning at 10:30 by Dr.
C. Wesley Flint, president of Cornell
college.
Mondoy, September 11th, will be
"Farmer's Day". On this day ad
dresses will be given by experts along
farming and dairying, and fvery farm
er for miles around Buck Creek will
want to be present. An interesting
porgram is being arranged for Mon
day evening.
Tuesdoy, September lltli. is "Big
Fair Day." The Hlopkinton band will
be present to furnish the ausic. The
progra ti for this day will prove of
especial interest to farmers, as such
vital subjects as corn growing, and
hog cho'era and grub worm cures.are
to be discussed by prominent speak
ers. In tl,e afternoon Miss Emma For
dyce of Cedar Rapids will give an
address, her subject being "Iowa's
Best Crop."
1916 State Fair a Success.
The Iowa State fair of 1916 proved a
success from every standpoint.
exhibits of stock md grain demon
strated the fact that Iowa is a great
agricultural state. The corn exhibit,
which drew the grand prize at the San
Francisco exposition, was on display
and attracted thousands of the visi
tors. The program of free attractions,
horse and auto races, air ship flights
and fire works furnished sufficient
amusement for the visitors. Educa
tional features are being added each
year. Many of the High schools of the
state had on display a large assort
ment of articles made in the manual
training and domestic science depart
ments. The Red Oak schools, over
which Supt. J. R. Inman presides, had
an unusually good exhibit. Industrial

of our people, and who several years

future.
Dry Spell Is Broken.
.Copious showers on Monday and
Tuesday of this wiek put an end to
the long dry spell, and all vegetation
has taken a new lease on life. The
showers have also worked wonders in
improving the publio highways around
Manchester, which were getting in
terrible condition. Ruts and chuck
holes were filled, making it possible
to travel by auto with some degree of
comfort.
Baseball Tournament.
A baseball tournament is to be held

MANCHESTER, IOWA SEPTEMBER 6, 1916.
"The Battle Cry of Peace."
I have seen "The 'Battle Cry of
Peace" and never before witnessed
and never again expect to witness a
greater war drama. It seemed to me
like an inspired argument for national
preparedness. Hudson Maxim's lec
ture, descriptive of our defenseless
condition as a nation, is a leading
feature.
Words are inadequate vehicles with
which to convey the horrors of the
war scenes disclosed in these moving
pictures. But there are many bright
sidelights, showing vistas into pleas
ant social life, which tend to relieve
the pent up feelings produced by the
awfulness of war.
If this great drama can be produced
here in Manchester, as it is being pro
duced in the big cities, and I am as
sured that it will be, then it should
be seen by every person in Delaware
county, and then some.
!—E. M. Carr.
Fire At Utley's Cafe.
A fire which threatened to destroy
the Utley Restaurant on Monday after
noon, was discovered just in time to
subdue the ftajnes before much dam
resulted to the building, although
one of the boys employed in the res
taurant was terribly burned about the
face and hands. It appears that Clyde
Pope and a helper had filled the large
gasoline tank which is located in a
brick vault under thg sidewalk in
front of the building, and struck a
light so that they could see to proper
ly close the tank. The boys apparent
ly did not realize that while the gaso
line was being poured from the barrel
into the large tank that the gas was
evaporating and filling the basement.
When the light was struck a terrific
explosion occurred, and young Pope
was frightfully burned, while the other
boy escaped without injury. The burns
on Mr. Pope's face and hands are not
deep, but are very painful, and will
confine him to his home for several
days.
The fire department responded very
promptly to a call, and soon had the
flames subdued. Had the gasoline tank
exploded the chances are that the
building would have been wrecked,
and the two boys who were in the
basement killed.
Marcuccl Cafe Sold.
A. Marcucci, who has conducted a
cafe and restaurant on Main street for
nearly three years, sold his stock and
fixtures to Joe Sramek of this city,
the deal being closed on Friday. About

MR. AND MRS. NORTON GRANTED
AUDIENCE WITH THE
QUEEN.
"THE KING LOVES AMERICANS"
Letter of Mrs. Norton Full of Interest,
and Tells of Characteristic
Qualities of the Queen.
But how came it that we were privi
leged to spend a fortnight in La Pan
ne, when the time limit for all visi
tors is at the most two days?
We had been Ignorant of this re
striction, up to the time of reaching
La Panne, hence the letters written to
our boys, giving them fifteen days as
the duration of our visit there. After
learning of this austere regulation,
we had no time to re-communicate with
our soldier friends, as strange as it
may seem, a letter takes longer to
reach them at the front, from La Pan
ne, than it would from London often
a week being occupied in transit.
Wje had several letters of introduc
tion, to officials, but those to whom
we appealed, were kindly, but power
less. "It is impossible for you to re
main longer," was the verdict of Head
Quarters. Then a wonderful thing
occurred. A Captain, to whom we had
presented a letter of introduction, be
stirred himself in our behalf, and
wrote a letter to the Queen, asking
that she might grant us an interview.
We had already requested such an in
terview, only to be told that Her Ma
jesty was so occupied, that longer no
tice would be necessary in order to
secure this privilege. And we must
leave in a day's time.
Then it was that our friend the
Captain came to our rescue. He wrote
us also a little note, which reached
us by special messenger at midnight,
telling us that he had sent a special
message to the Queen, and that he
hoped for the best results, also telling I
us that we should remain close to the
Hotel the following day (our last),!
in order to be ready to receive any!
word that might come from her Ma
jesty. It is needless to state that we
did not wander far afield during the
eral rooms ttf iv
made the necessary changes to make
one of the most modern and up-to-date
cafes in this part of the state. Mr.
Marcucci was accorded a generous
patronage from the people of Man
chester and tourists, and gave his
patrons prompt and courteous ser
vice. In operating this first-class cafe
Mrs. Marcucci did her share of the
work, and in order to relieve her of
much hard work necessary in con
ducting a cafe Mr. and Mrs. Marcucci
have decided upon this move. For
several weeks Mr. Marcucci will assist
Mr. Sramek with the work, while Mrs.
Marcucci and her daughters will spend
a few weeks with relatives and friends in La Panne, and we had walked up to
in Lincoln, Nebraska, and other
places. So far their plans for the
future are not settled. We regret very
much to have these estimable people
leave Manchester.
The new owner is well known In
Manchester. He has been the em
ploy of B. G. Grems for several years,
and has proven himself a competent
and trustworthy young business man.
Mr. Sramek will continue to give the
public the same prompt and courteous

pext twenty-four hours!
The whole day passed, but no word
from the Villa Royal. By six o'clock all
hope had died. Very sorrowfully but
resignedly we packed all our belong
ings, and awaited the motor car that
was to convey us to Dunkerque, by
ie'
eral,
Six-thirty, and there was a knock at
our door. It opened to an imposing
looking Major. From the Villa Royal
he came, with the royal summons, to
wait immediately upon Her Majesty.
No time was lost in making a rapid
change of toilette, and we descended
to the street. We must not keep a
Queen waiting, so we commandered
the first motor car In sight, which
changed to belong to an officer (need
less to say there are no taxicabs In
La Panne,) and we proceeded on our
way.
There are no very great distances
the beach to within sight of the Royal
Villas, already several times, but this
time all was different, we were to
enter there!
The Villas themselves, presented no
striking contrast to their nearby
neighbors simple and unpretentious,
they little resembled the aborie of Roy
alty. But although we had not been
long in La Penne, we had been long
enough to gather fleeting glimpses of
their Majesties, as they moved about
treatment which has made the place simply and unostentatiously amongst
so popular in the past with many of! their people, and the simplicity of
our people. their abode matched the extreme and
absolutely self-forgetful' unpreten-
Harry Fltok and His Band. tiousness of their daily life.
This office acknowledges t. pleasant At tho entrance to the larger Villa
call from Harry Fink, organizer and
director of the band which furnishes
such excellent musical programs dur
ing the Jubilee this week. Mr. Fink
a natural born musician, ?nd has a
faculty of selecting men who are art
ists in the musical line. He has a band
of about twenty pieces and gives two
concerts daily on the streets of the
city. He has been with the H. W.
Campbell United Shows for several
years, and everywhere thiB organiza
tion has played they have given the
best of satisfaction. Their concerts
on the streets and at the fair grounds
were thoroughly enjoyed by the big
crowds which assembled. Mr. Fink
makes his headquarters in San Fran
cisco, and followed for years the
printer's trade and when he strikes a
city the odor of printers' ink has a
certain fascination which grips him.
we were met by an official who con
ducted us to the rear, from whence we
passed to the second and smaller Vil
la here we were met by a footman
who threw open a door at our right,
and announced us to Her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth. As we errered the
comfortably furnished salon, lighted
by a shaded table lamp, we were con
scious that the Queen was standing
alone in the centre of the room, and
's we advanced toward her, she held
out her hand to us, with a cordial
smile of greeting.
For us it was a truly great moment,
not because she was a Queen, but be
cause she was the Queen for us, of all
others, the Queen owned and beloved
of all our Belgian boys, the Queen of
whom they had told us countless
stories, illustrative of her quiet hero
ism, her self forgetful devotion, her
tender pity, and generosity of heart
One of our boys had tpld us how when
he lay in the hospital in La Penne,
with just one great longing, that he
might be sent to an English hospital,
that there entered the room where he
was lying, a slender figure clad in
white. Others in that hospital had seen
that gracious figure, day after day.
came to give of her strength and
skill and love, to comfort and aid her
stricken soldiers, but this was his first
glimpse of her.
Before he knew what he was doing,
he had unburdened himself of all his
sweet green fields"
of England, and Her Majesty had as
sured the boy that she would herself
see to his transfer.
Another of our boys, bearing proud
ly on his breast the military decora
tion, highest of all in the Belgian army
Nvhich every officer seeing, must sa
lute, the "Chevalier de l'ordre de Leo-
I W
pold" told us how when the King
pinned it on he sadi, "I would rather
present you with this decoration, than
any General in my army," but that
the Queen when she kissed him on
each cheek, wept. No wonder they are
all willing to brave any danger, or en
dure any suffering, for such a King
and Queen!
Still another soldier told us how he
had heard an officer say to the Queen,
"But your Majesty may not pass that
way, it is far too dangerous," and that
he had heard the retort, "It is not too
dangerous for my soldiers, and I will
pass, I am the Queen."
One related to us an occurrence,
which he found very amusing. Her
Majesty was passing along his trench,
distributing chocolate and tobacco to
the soldiers. So quietly and unosten
tiously she did it, that many were un
aware of her identity At last one
grateful fellow, as she passed, patted
her in a friendly manner on the shoul
der, to whkh she responded with a
charming smile. But his comrades
were overcome with horror: by signs
and whispers they communicated the
fact of her identity, and too late, the
soldier sprang to salute, but by that
time his Queen was well around the
next corner of the trench, happier I
think in the friendly caress than she
would have been in the salute.
Many recollections of this nature
crowded in upon us. when at last we
stood in her presence. Her Majesty
was friendliness itself. After shaking
hands with us, she seated us, one on
each side of her, and commenced
speaking to us in her soft voice. In
ly, and as she conversed with us, so
sympathetically and feelingly we
found our hearts going out to her in
loyal homage. Surely no Queen has
been called upon to suffer so cruelly
as she, nor has borne her undeserved
sufferings with such fortitude and
quiet heroism.
But she spoke not at all about her
self, but only about her people. First
of all she desired to know about our
mission in La Panne, and then about
our work for and interest in, her sol
diers. As we told her of the work
we had endeavored to do for them, she
was deeply touched, and said not once
but many times. "But you are so very
kind!" She expressed to us the deep
gratitude of herself and the King, for
the aid extended to Belgian civilians
by the American people. "The _King
loves* Americans," she confided to me.
She accepted gratefully a little khaki
covered Testament, like thousands we
had given to Belgian soldiers, and told
us she was pleased that her soldiers
should receive them, Then I prepared
myself for the plunge.
"Your Majesty," I began,
a
little
ingt^i!5T«rha^4xpect«4Lto !u
two weeks here, and in" anticipation of
that had written to fifty of our boys,
asking them to meet us here, during
that time. Your" Majesty knows I con
tinued, "how the soldiers would prize
and appreciate the privilege of meeting
us here, cut off as they are from their
own families and friends, and what a
bitter disappointment it will be to
them, if they tramp perhaps twenty or
twenty-five kilometres and then they
should find us gone!" Then I stopped
a little breathless and. too, I had had
a happy thought. Reaching in my bag,
I produced a letter I had received just
that day from a boy«at the front.
"Dear Parents," he wrote, "I have
asked permission from my Command
ant, and I hope to see you within a
few days. If you could know how
anxious I am to see you, and how long
the time will seem. Your de
voted son, Rene." (Another Rene, we
have three, altogether!)
Her Majesty kindly took the letter
in her hand, and read it through, then
looked up at us, "But he calls you his
parents," she remarked. Then we told
her a little something of our "family."
and there was a suspicion of tears in
her eyes, as she said, "I will do for
you what I can. I hope I may be able
to secure for you the permission to
remain longer. Do not leave the hotel
tonight until you hear from me."
We chatted with Her Majesty a little
longer, and then t.fter an interview of
twenty minutes, we arose to go. Only
then did she arise, and again extended
her hand to us, in farewell.
The Royal Car took us back to our
humble hotel, and we carried with us
a priceless possession the eternal re
membrance of a Royal Lady, gracious
and beautiful, and very kind, with a
gentle dignity of presence that m°de
the title of Queen, seem singularly ap
propriate, ^nd a heart, the tendeV
sympathy of which, we could read only
too clearly.
We were not at our hotel long, be
fore the messenger came from the
Queen, bearing a memorandum. We
could scarcely believe our eyes, when
we saw we were given, not the week
we hesitatingly asked for, but ten
days!
One other time we saw the Queen,
as Her Majesty, with King Albert,
mounted their horses for their morn
ing canter along the sands. When she
saw us, recognizing us. she bowed and|
smiled, and spoke to the King, who j
also bowed.
The glorious King and Queen of the
Belgians! Surely a long and prosper
ous reign lies ahead of them in which
to forget the shame and suffering of
these last dreadful months but sure it
is, that the hearts of their people are
welded to theirs by bands of steel, for
all-time.
