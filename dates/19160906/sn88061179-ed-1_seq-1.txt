Eight Hour
Day
Threatened Railroad Strike
Averted By Action of
Congress.
Washington, Sept. 2.?The
threat of n general railroad
strike, which lias been hanging
like a pall over the country for
a month, was lifted tonight.
Three hours after the Senate
awed, without amendment,the
Adamson eight hour day bill,
passed by the House yesterday,
the heads of the four great rail?
roads omployes' brotherhoods
telegraphed ??0 odd code mes?
sages to their general chairmen
in nil parts of the country, can?
celling I he st rike order issued
a week ago to lake effect next
Munday morning at 7 o clock.
The legislative expedient to
avert the strike was passed in
the Senate by a vote of in to 28
?almost a strict party vote?
amid stirring scenes,after many
Senators, Democrats and Re?
publicans, hud fought des
pe'rately to amend the measure
by provisions designed to pro
vent industrial disasters in the
future. Some S o n a t o r e,
thoroughly aroused, declared
Congress was being coerced in
to enactment of legislation thai
it did not want, and that it
kuuw would return to plague in
the future.
In both Houses the measure
was signed within a few min?
utes after the final vote in Sen?
ate and it was sent at once to
the White House, where Presi?
dent Wilson will sign it at 7:110
o'clock tomorrow morning, af?
ter his return from Shadow
LaWU, Officials of the brother
hoods who witnessed tho final
passage of tho hill, had an?
nounced early in the night that
cancellation of the striko order
would not lie ordered until tint
bill had been signed by the
President ami actually had be?
come law. Hut later they con?
ferred, changed their minds and
llitdbed tho Code messages Big
nulling to the waiting trainmen
of the country through their
chairmen the message that sat?
isfactory settlement had been
sic tired.
The bill that stopped the
strike provides that after Jan?
uary 1, 1017, eight hours shall
In regarded as a basis of reckon?
ing for a day's pay of men en?
gaged in the operation of rail
roinl trains in interstate com?
merce (excepting roads less
than 100 miles long and electric?
al lines), ami they shall receive
pro rata pay for work in excess
of eight hours, and that their]
rule of compensation shall not
I'o changed, pending an investi?
gation for from six to nine
mouths of tho effect of the
eight-hour day upon tho rail
loads by a commission to be
appointed by the President.

Fears Advance
New York Epidemic Not Re?
garded as Being as Ser
ionc to Virginia as
Cases Nearer
Home.
Richmond, Va., Aug. 31,_
With tlie railroads co-operating
actively in tho enforcement of
Virginia's quarantine against
children from New York, New
.Jersey and Pennsylvania, the
Stale Board of Health is winch?
ing with concern the southward
progress of the infantile paraly?
sis epidemic. In this, tho
board thinks, lies Virginia's
chief danger, nor is the board
inclined to regard tho decrease
of the oqidemic in New York as
guaranteeing that states to the
south of New York will escape.
"The general situation", said
Health Commissioner Wilhams
today,''resembles that in which
a lire is spreading from the
sparks of the original conilagn
tion. As long as tho 'lire' was
confined to New York at a sea?
son when there were compara?
tively few children passing be?
tween this State and New York,
wo of course viewed it with
profound sympathy hut without
grave apprehension. It was
reasonable to suppose that the
'fire' would burn ittelf out?
pathetic though its conse?
quences were.
"In recent weeks, as tho out?
break has begun to decline in
New York, it has spread north
ami south, just as tho sparks
are carried from a lire. These
'sparks', in turn, have started
now 'tires' of epidemics, some
of which nie close to Virginia.
It is these we are watching and
it is from these that we expect
trouble, if any comes. The
'fire' is getting closu to our
'block' and it is time to take
pr< cautions that were relatively
unnecessary as long as the 'lire'
was confined to Now York City.
"Another factor in the situa?
tion which makes this the moat
important lime for precautions
is that Virginia children who
have been summering in the
north are beginning to return
home. We had no statistics as
to the number of these children
when wu declared quarantine,
but we can see from the re?
quests and appeals made to the
board during the last few days
that the number is large. Tho
Schools are soon to open; the
vacation period is at an end.
Kor one child that came south
during the lirst week in August
there will probably be ten who
come during the lirst week in
September. As some of these
have doubtless been exposed to
the d isease, the State must be
protected against them. This
is peculiarly the time for doing
so.
"In addition, we must reckon
on the large number of children
who come to Virginia to attend
schools. Knowing nothing of
the movements of theso chil?
dren during the summer, it is
not fair to subject other chil?
dren and the many private
schools of Virginia to the dan?
ger of infantile paralysis which
are especially great wore large
numbes of children congregato.
I "There are some things about
infantile paralysis that health
officers do not understand. But
merely because wo do not know
ail about the disease is no rea?
son why we should not apply
the knowledge we have. It
was on this view that our quar?
antine was declared and it is on
I this basis that it is moro than
justified. Wo may not be able
to keep out every singto indivi?
dual who tries to to get iu Vir?
ginia in defiance of quarantine,
but we shall certainly keep out
all wo can. Wo do not abolish
our police forces merely because
wo do not catch every law?
breaker; neither ought we do
away with precautions merely
because they may not suffice in
every instance."
Equal Suffrage
League.
The monthly meeting of the
Kqtial Suffrage League was
held at the school auditorium
Saturday afternoon, August 26,
at 4.00.
The reading of the minutes of
the previous meeting was dis
pensed with.
The membership committee
reported the names of four new
members to the League: Mr. and
Mrs. Britt K. Smith; Mrs. Gee.
Chapman, of Appalachia, and
Mrs. John Taylor.
Min? Nell Van (lorder, one of
the instructors in the High
School, who was present at 'he
meeting, agreed to teach the
course of lessens, which at a
previous meeting, it had been
decided the League would
study. The lirst lesson will he
taken up at the next meeting of
the League and at each meet?
ing following one lesson of the
series will he taught by Miss
Van Uorder. It is hoped that
each member of the League
will order one of the courses of
lessons which are only J.'i cents,
ami Miss Bumgardnor will send
in the order for those desiring
to procure the lessons.
Mrs. Benedict made a full re?
port on her work done in con?
nection with the library and it
was decided to get complete
estimates on all repairs noces
sary, taxes to be paid, anil oth?
er costs in connection with
opening tin1 building, to try to
secure additional monthly sub
Bcriptifus, and at the next
meeting make final decision in
regard to tin? matter.
After full discussion of the
matter, it .was decided to have
a sutfrage booth at the Wise
County Kair, September 28, '-".?
and 30th,and distribute BUffrage
literature, and also to try to se?
cure local speakers for (Mich
day of the Kair to aid the
speakers which the StateLeague
j proposes to send for that oc?
casion. Miss Bumgardnor was
[directed to write the State
League regarding this matter
and to ask thai we he furnished
with the literature for distribu?
tion, j
