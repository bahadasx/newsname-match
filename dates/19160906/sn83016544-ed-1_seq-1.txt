TWENTY-FIVE AUTOS
ARRIVED HERE SUNDAY
On Saturday night about a dozen
cars arrived in the village, laden with
tourists for their first visit in Grand
Marais, via the North Shore Boule­
vard. On Sunday about twenty-five
more cars arrived, and our hotel
facilities were taxed to capacity to
take care of all the guests. To their
credit it must be said that by enlist­
ing a number of spare rooms in res­
idences in the village, all the visitors
were provided for. The heavy rain
which we had all day Sunday made
our road a little slippery, but no
complaints were made on the road in
Cook county. The Lake county road
between Finland and Cramer was
pretty badly cut up and quite a
number of cars were mired and had
to have assistance to get out. The
visitors were all pleased with their
trip to Grand Marais, and most of
them promised to come again, with
a hope that weather conditions
would be more favorable for the trip.
Among the visitors were: Mr. and
Mrs. C. H. Taylor, Mr. and Mrs. J.
F. Dennis, Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Jones,
Mr. and Mrs. A. M. Chisholm, Mr.
and Mrs. E. H. Windom, Mr. and
Mrs. Matt Gasser, Mr. and Mrs.J. P.
Johnson, Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Johnson,
Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Harlan, Mr. and
Mrs. F. A. Beck, Mr. and Mrs. R. J.
Davis, Mr. and Mrs. S. H. Hill, Mr.
and Mrs. F. E. Pattison, Mr. and
Mrs. T. W. Hoopes, Mr. and Mrs. C.
D. Velie, Miss Claudia Gowan, Miss
Hoopes, Miss Mary Gasser, Messrs.
Harrold Gassor, Kirby Jones, L.
Peavey, and G. A. Gallinger, all of
Duluth.
Mrs. H. Blakeslee, of Rochester,
Minn., who has been visiting with
Mr. and Mrs. Axel Berglund the past
month, left for her home on Satur­
day.
Oscar Olson returned to the village
last Thursday afternoon with the
first new model Ford received in this
village. This was also the first car
of the new model assembled in Du­
luth, having been received in a car­
load of fourteen machines. The
changes in that popular car are a
big improvement in looks and will
probably make them more popular
than ever.
The box social on Maple Hill was a
success from start to finish. Mr. G.
F. Lundquist made it very interest­
ing for the audience while selling
the boxes, which sold for $2.00 to
$4.50. Mr. Peter Johnson and Mr.
Charley Anderson were the more
fortunate ones, respectively getting
a ladies and gentlemen's watch. The
net proceeds were about $35.00. The
pleasantness that prevailed in the
different events was a common fea­
ture of the entertainment given by
the Community Literary Society.
The Rev. Father Simon, of Cloquet,
will arrive at Grand Marais Friday
night, Sept. 8th, and will remain here
over Sunday, the 10th. On Sunday,
at 10 o'clock, all both white and
Indians who have not yet been con­
firmed shall come to hear the neces­
sary instructions at the church in
the Chippewa Village. The Rt. Rev.
Bishop J. McGolrick, of Duluth, will
come to Grand Marais the latter part
of September to dedicate the new
church in town and to administer the
Sacrament of Confirmation to some
sixty young people. The date of
dedication of church and confirma­
tion will be made known later.

THE COOK COUNTY NEWS-HE
GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN., SEPTEMBER 6, 1916.
LOCAL SCHOOL OPENED
TUESDAY, SEPT. STH.
Prospects Encouraging for Success­
ful Year for Teachers and Pupils.
Enrollment Increased.
School opened on Tuesday morning
after the usual three months vaca­
tion. The faculty organization is as
follows:
Superintendent—M. R. Beebc, of
Minneapolis, Minn.
Principal—Mrs. Victor Skoog, of
Grand Marais.
Domestic Science—Miss Josephine
Schaller, of Hastings, Minn.
Eighth Grade—Miss Edith Robin*
son, of Pine City, Minn.
Sixth and seventh grades—Miss
Cora Bulman, of Minneapolis, Minn.
Fourth and fifth grades—Miss
Merle Lien, of Grand Marais.
Second and third grades—Miss
Elizabeth Cavanaugh, of Hopkins,
Minn.
Primary—Miss Lillian Riedesell, of
Crookston, Minn.
As to the enrollment, figures are
not yet available, but there are
about twenty new pupils in the pri­
mary room, so that there should be
an increase in enrollment, over last
year. There are some under sixteen
years of age who have not finished
the eighth grade and who have
dropped school work and an effort
will be made to induce these to at­
tend school. The state law on this
subject makes it incumbent upon the
superintendent to see that all chil­
dren of school age, and not over six­
teen, attend school untill they finish
the eighth grade.
More attention is to be paid to the
teaching of music in all the rooms.
This is to be in charge of Miss Bul­
man, who is to have charge of that
department. She will also teach
penmanship.
The domestic science department
under Miss Josephine Schaller, will
be enlarged and adapted to the needs
of the community.
The school board has voted the sum
of $200.00 for additional books for
the library. This will be used in
purchasing reference books largely.
Several improvements have been
made and are planned in the manual
training department, which is in
charge of Supt. Beebe.
There are quite a number of stu­
dents who have finished the eighth
grade in other districts in the coun­
ty and an effort is being made to in­
duce them to attend our high school.
Supt. Beebe will assist any of these
who desire to get a place to work
for their room and board, and will
be glad to learn of prospective stu­
dents.
The faculty is the result of earnest
consideration of applications# and
references on the part of the school
board, and the prospects are for a
successful and pleasant school year.
NOTICE.
It has come to my notice that
some of the new State Road is being
used in a manner in which no road
can be used and be kept fit for wheel
traffic, also that the ditches are be
ing blocked and obstructions left in
the road for a day or two at a time.
For the benefit of those who do
not know that there is a law pro­
hibiting this, and do not appreciate
an expensive public improvement nor
have any regard for the rights of
their neighbors, I will quote the
State Law:
"Obstruction of or damage to High­
ways.—Any person who shall obstruct
any of the public highways of this
State in any manner, or who shall
dig any holes, therein, or remove any
earth, gravel or rock therefrom, or
any part thereof, or who shall in any
manner obstruct any ditch on the
side of any such highways, and there­
by damage the
same,
shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor. It is hereby made
the duty of the county attorney to
prosecute all violations of the pro­
visions of this section, occurring in
his county.
A misdemeanor is punishable by a
fine of not more than $100.00 or nine­
ty days in the County jail.
From now on, any one found dam­
aging the roads placed under my care
will be prosecuted to the limit under
the above, quoted law.
GEO. B. HUGHES,
Highway Engineer
of Cook County.
NOTICE.
On account of the burglary of
the post office we have lost the
records of money orders cashed from
August 1st to 12th. Will all those
who cashed orders here during that
time kindly let us know the office
from which it was issued and the
amounts.
RUTH G. SODERBERG,
Postmaster.
SURVEY OF CASCADE RIVER
MADE BY F. D. McMILLAN
Possibility of Developing Water
Power for Electric Power
and Light.
F. D. McMillan, ofMinneapolis, has
completed a primery survey of the
Cascade River for the purpose of
considering the possibility of putting
in a dam and developing a power
plant and furnishing this village and
community with electric power and
light. The survey shows that a fall
of about 150 feet can be secured on
a comparatively short distance. The
installation of "a plant giving this
village electric light and power would
be a great improvement and would
be well patronized.
PARTY FROM LITTLE MARAIS
MAKE TRIP OVER ROAD
Messrs. John Hanson and Alfred
M. Fenstad, of Little Marais, and
Miss Nellie M. Fradenburg, of Schroe
der, Minn., motored to Grand Marais
on Sunday August 28th, and report
a very enjoyable trip.
While they hail from Lake County
they do not hesitate to say nice
things about our roads and real nice
things at that. Mr. Fenstad says
that the day is not far distant when
the Lake Superior Forest Reserve
will be receiving attention from the
Department of Interior, National
Highways constructed and the North
Shore Boulevard and our beattiful
lakes and streams receiving atten­
tion and advertising in the "See
America First" campaign now waged
by the Department of the Interior
in an effort to keep the money at
home that has heretofore been taken
to Europe by the traveling public.
Mr. Fenstad takes occasion to con­
gratulate Cook county on the roads
and the general good management of
the road building, which has brought
it up to the high standard which he
says is a mark for Lake county to
attempt to attain.
G. W. Gowan left for Minneapolis
on Thursday night.

tractive homes in the village.

fred Berglund, Christ Everson, Engel
Tormundson and Wm. Huseby. This
list may not be complete.
On Saturday a fire broke out in
the neighborhood of the West Col
vill school, having started from
sparks from some piles of brush
which Matt Lanktree was burning on
the G. W. Gowan land. The fire
gained quite a little headway before
it was discovered by Mr. Lanktree,
who immediately took steps to stop
it. It burned over about twenty
five acres of old burning, incidentally
doing a good job, as the conditions
were favorable for burning clean.
The heavy rain on Sunday put the
fire entirely out.
Dental Notice
My dental office in the cabin is
now open. Those waiting artificial
plates will please call and have im­
pressions early.
T. M. ROBERTSON. D. D. S.

MEETING OF SCHOOL
OFFICIALS WELL ATTENDED
Superintendent of Schools N. J.
Young, of St. Louis county, arrived
in the village on Friday night. He
was here representing the State
Board of Education and a meeting
of members of school boards was
called for Saturday morning at nine
o'clock at the court house. Every
school board in the county was rep­
resented, except our local board,
most of the members of which were
out of town. At the meeting Supt.
M. R. Beebe of our local school gave
a very interesting and instructive
talk on manual training, its purpose
arid the aims that should be held in
its teaching. Supt. N. A. Young gave
an instructive talk on the efficiency
of a county board of education and
some of those present were much
impressed with the idea of urging
their respective districts to come in
under a county board of education.
Supt. Clinch made a few remarks re­
garding reports of officers of the re­
spective districts, and the meeting
was a success, judging from the dis­
cussions of the matters touched in
the talkes gave at the meeting. We
will give more details of the county
board of education idea in our next
issue.
