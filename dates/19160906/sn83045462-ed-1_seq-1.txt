REITERATES CHARGE
AGAINSRH. DODGE
Rodenberg Cites Arizona Court
Record to Prove Munitions
Shipments to Mexico.
NEUTRALITY VIOLATION
CHARGED IN INDICTMENT
Representative's Speech. Directed
Against Democratic Contributor,
Attracts Attention in House.
In a speech on the floor of the
House today Representative Ro
denberg of Illinois declared that
the federal court records of Ari
zona proved beyond quibble his
contention that Cleveland H.
Dodge of New York, a contribu
tor to the democratic national
campaign to the extent of S86.000,
had been interested personally in
the shipment of ammunition to!
Carranzista troops in Mexico. ]
The record he produced was the
report of an indictment of the
Phelps Dodge Mercantile Com
pany for violating the neutrality
resolution of March 14, 1912.
The speech of Representative Roden
berg attracted great attention in the
House, because of the denial which fol
lowed his original statements a few
days ago. At that time Mr. Rodenberg
charged that Phelps, Dodge & Co. had
shipped the ammunition used against
the American troopers at the Carrizal
fljht, and that Cleveland H. Dodge was
a big contributor to the democratic
campaign. Mr. Dodge denied he was in
terested in the manufacture of ammu
nition, and Secretary Lansing, who had
been drawn into the original Roden-1
berg charges, denied knowing Mr.
Dodge.
Cites Court Record.
"In wording his denial, Mr. Dodge
proves conclusively that after all there
is something in a name," Mr. Roden
berg said. "It is very apparent that he
is trying to 'dodge' the charge that I
have made against him and the cor
poration with which he is connected. I
distinctly stated in my speech that the
Phelps-Dodge Company is engaged in
the manufacture and sale of munitions
of war, arod in support of that charge I
desire to submit the following proof:
In volume 209 Federal Reporter for the
year 1118, beginning at page^910, will
be found an account of the indictment
of the Phelps-Dodge Mercantile Com
pany in 1913 for shipping munitions
into Mexico in violation of the neu
trality resolution of March 14, 1912. The
trial judge was Hon. William C. Saw
telle."
Representative Rodenberg did not
read the entire court proceeding, which
contained several thousand words, but
extended it in the Record. He also
laid before the House quotations from
Moody's Manual of Railroad and Cor
poration Securities, a financial analysis
of the Phelps-Dodge Mercantile Com
pany, of which C. H. Dodge is given as
a vice president. The ownership of i
all the stock in the Phelps-Dodge Mer- ,
cantile Company was in the name of 1
Phelps. Dodge & Co.
Interested in Sale, He Claims.
"It may be true that Phelps, Dodge
& Co. are not interested in the manu
facture of munitions of war," Repre
sentative Rodenberg continued, "but In
the face of this record it cannot be de
nied by any man who has the slightest
regard for the truth that Phelps, Dodge
& Co. are interested in the sale of mu
nitions of war."
Representative Rodenberg said that
the indictment was dismised bv Judge :
Sawtelle upon a trivial technicality. ,
He then said that Judge Sawtelle was
appointed in August, 1913, by Presi
dent Wilson.
"His principal backer and the man
who was primarily responsible for his i
appointment," said Mr. Rodenberg, "was
Mr. Everett Ellingwood, general attor
ney for the Phelps Dodge & Co. inter
ests in Arizona. Mr. Cleveland H.
Dodge Joined in this recommendation."
Contributions $86,000, He Says.
Representative Rodenberg said he had
underestimated the campaign contri
butions to the democratic party from
Cleveland H. Dodge, the real sum being
$*6,000 instead of merely $30,000. He
also said that if Secretary of State
l.?ansing denied knowing Mr. Dodge he
would accept that statement.
"However, he produced proof that the
State Department had permitted a mil
lion rounds of ammunition to bo ship
ped into Mexico a short time before the
fight at Parral.
"No apologist for the administration
will deny that this ammunition was
used in the fight a% ("arriza!, where
nineteen of our brave troopers were am
bushed and foully murdered by the ad
herents of Carranza. The point that I
make in that the State Department has
permitted ammunition to be imported
into Mexico from the I'nited States to
be subsequently used in an attack upon
our soldiers."

BRI1ISH LABOR ASKS
TARIFF PROTECTION
Trades Union Congress Wants
Measures Taken to Keep
Out Cheap Imports.
BIRMINGHAM, England, September 6,
3:35 p.m.?The Trades Union Congress,
representing nearly 2,500,000 organized
workers of Great Britain, took an im
portant and unexpected step today by
adopting, with a majority of more than
1,000,000 votes, a resolution virtually in
dorsing the principle of ^protection.
The resolution asks for "the adoption of
methods for restricting or preventing the
importation of cheap manufactured goods
produced at lower rates of wages and
under worse labor conditions than prevail
in this country."
* Resolution Interpreted.
Although these words themselves ac
cept the principle ?f a protective tariff
wall, the protectionists among the labor
delegates and in other circles are not in
clined to regard the workmen as having
been won over to a complete change from
free trade. One of the labor leaders of
the house of commons said the meaning
of the resolution was merely that meas
ures had been taken to investigate the ori
gin of goods and conditions under which
they are produced, with a view to pre
venting the unloading of cheap goods in
this country after the war, which is much
feared.
The congress considered other reso
lutions regarded as of importance for
labor after the war, including one deal
ing with restoration of trades union,
rights which have been suspended in
order to increase the output of muni
tions.
Pension Commission Criticized.
Undue delays in granting pensions to
those incapacitated in the war by
wounds or disease were denounced. De
mands were advanced for the abolition
of what was characterized as "ante
diluvian old fogeyism" of the pension
commission.
The congress went on record in favor
of creation of a state department for
adjustment of pension claims. Nation
alization of agriculture, shipping indus
tries and mines met with unanimous
approval of the delegates, who yester
day called for nationalization of rail
roads. /.
A fixed minimum wa?e and shorter
hours of labor also were advocated to
avoid unemployment and distress after
the war.
NEVADA CONVENTIONS MEET.
Republicans, Democrats and Social

RENO. Nev., September 6.?Samuel
Piatt of Reno was nominated for
United States senator yesterday by the
republican state convention over A. H.
Howe of Goldfleld. Representative E. E.
Roberts was renominated without op
position.
Senator Key Pittman again was given
the nomination at the democratic con
vention. E. E. C&ihe was flamed for
representative. The socialist conven
tion named A. Grant Miller for the
senatorial candidate and Martin Scan
Ian for Congress.
The three conventions were held in
conformity to the new primary law
which abolished the direct vote.
Tnkon "Wet" by Three Votes.
DAWSON, Yukon, September 6.?Offi
cial figures on Yukon territory's first
vote on prohibition give the "wets" a
majority of only three votes for the
entire territory, it was announced to
day. The contest was to abolish the
licensed hotel, the only form of saloon
now allowed in the territory. The
mining districts almost without ex
ception voted for prohibition.
WILL DELAY SELECTIONS
FOR THREE NEW BOARDS
President Wilson Taking Time for
Choosing Members of Bodies
Recently Created.
President Wilson will not appoint the
members of the United States shipping
board?to put into effect the shipping
bill passed by Congress and probably
to receire his signature today?before
leaving Washington. Neither will he
appoint the members of the tariff board,
just being created by Congress, nor the
members of the board to enforce the
new workmen's compensation law,
which he will probably sign this after
noon or tomorrow.
These three new laws will put into
the President's hands some of the
choicest appointments of his adminis
tration. The members of the shipping
board are to get $7,500 a year each, and
the terms are from two to six years
each. The tariff board members will
also get high salaries, and the members
of the board to enforce the new com
pensation law will also be well paid.
The secretary to the shipping board will
receive $5,000 a year.
It is not expected at the White House
that the President will be prepared to i
constitute these boards for some time
to come. He proposes to take much time
looking into the qualifications of the
men who may be suggested. He will
confer with cabinet officers concerning,
the personnel of each body, and it may
be fully another month before he makes
the announcements.
As the eight-hour law for railroads
i does not become effective until January
1 the President is not expected to name
the three men to investigate the Opera
tions of that law for two or three
months, but w'll give sufficient time for
them to make arrangements to start
work just as soon as the law is effective.
REPORTED PLAN TO RETIRE
TUMULTY UNCONFIRMED
Rumored That Secretary to Presi
dent Will Be Given Fat Fed
eral Plum Elsewhere.
No confirmation could be had in any '
official quarter today of a story that Sec
retary Tumulty is to be displaced as
President Wilson's principal aid shortly
after the November elections, and given
a fat federal plum elsewhere, the specific
place now mentioned being membership
on the board of appraisers in New York.
The stories allege that although Mr.
Tumulty is satisfactory to the President
some of Mr. Wilson's closest advisers do
not exhibit the same friendship, and have
been using pressure to have Mr. Tumulty
succeeded by somebody else.
Mr. Tumulty himself indicated that so
far as he knew there was absolutely
nothing to the story, and he feels no un
easiness as to encountering the displeas
ure of the President. Mr. Tumulty's in
timate friends were of the same opinion
and, along with many of those in almost
daily contact with the President and hav- |
ing the President's confidence, com- !
mended Mr. Tumulty as one of the best
t-etretaries a President ever had. Mr.
Tumulty is given credit for political wis
dom and executive ability possessed by
few secretaries, and with having been of
inestimable value to Mr. Wilson in his
present position.
AGAIN SIGNS 8-H0UR ACT.
President Makes Sure of Legality of
Legislation.
President Wilson decided to take no
chances as to the legality of the eight
hour bill for railroad employes because
he signed it Sunday. Last night he
signed the measure again.
He went through this unusual pro
cedure because there was fear that the
railroads in attacking the constitution
ality of the law might make the claim
that it was not effective because it was
signed on Sunday.
As the enrolled bill went to the State
Department last night to become a pub
lic record it bore the President's signa
ture twice, with the dates September S
and September 5.
NEWYORKCARMEN
TO VOTE ON STRIKE
Union Leaders Expect Order
Will Direct Walk-Out
Tomorrow.
NEW YORK, September 6.?A strike
which would tie up the subway and
elevated lines of the Interborough
Rapid Transit Company and cause un
told inconvenience in the most con
gested sections of the city was fore
cast by union leaders today to begin
at 2 o'clock tomorrow morning1.
The company's employes demand an
nulment of individual contracts bind
ing many of them not to seek wage
increases for two years.
Voting begun this morning among
the men was abandoned later in favor
of a plan for balloting at mass meet
ings tonight.
Not to Wait on Mayor.
In view of an announcement by thie
company that it would not consent to
arbitration it was virtually decided by
the union not to await possible inter
vention by Mayor John P. Mitchel. The
latter is returning to the city by auto
mobile from the Plattsburg military
training camp, and is expected here to
morrow.
There were indications today that a
strike on the Interborough lines might
be followed closely by a tie-up of many
city surface cars. About 500 men of
the "green car" system of the New
York Railways Company, which re
cently settled wage differences with its
employes, voted today in favor of strik
ing in sympathy with the Interbor
ough's men. Balloting on similar action
i on other street car systems will be held
tonight and tomorrow.
Says Roads Forcing Strike.
W. B. Fitzgerald, organizer of the
Amalgamated Association of Street
Railway Employes, declares that the
traction company is trying to force the
men to a strike for the purpose of
breaking the hold which the union is
obtaining upon its employes.
Company Will Fight.
Officials of the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company assert they will con
duct a fight against the union if the
strike threat is carried out.
Theodore P. Shonts, president of the
company denies the charges of union
representatives that intimidation or
coercion had been used to get the sub
way and elevated railway employes to
sign a so-called "master-and-servant
agreement." binding them not to seek
wage increases for two years.

Berlin Admits Czar's Forces
Have Pushed Back Center of
Austrian Front.
LEMBERG MAY FALL SOON,
IS VIEW AT PETROGRAD
Believed to Offer Easier Succesi
Than Against the German
Center at Kovel.
BERLIN, September 6, via
London, 4:42 p.m.?Russian
forces, says the official state
ment issued today at the
German army headquarters,
have pressed back the center
of Archduke Charles' front
between the Zlota Lipa and
the Dniester river, in Galicia.
PETROGRAD, September 6
via London, 2:14 p.m.?Russiar
troops yesterday captured a Tetf
tonic fortified position in th<
region of the lower Gorodenka, ir
the direction of Halicz, Galicia
and drove the Austro-German?
toward the northwest, says th<
Russian official statement issuet
today.
The number of prisoners taker
in the fighting on the lower Goro
denka, the statement adds, so fa:
amounts to 4,500, among whon
were about 2,000 Germans.
Heavy Austro-German Losses.
The supposition that Gen. Brussiloflfj
campaign had exhausted itself anc
come to a full stop before the gather
ing forces of Austro-Germans, who ar<
standing concentrated on the roads t<
Kovel and Lemberg, is apparently dis
proved by the figures of Austro-Ger
man recent losses as contained in re
ports received here.
The magnitude of the great Ruseiai
offensive, which still continues witl
scarcely any lessening in intensity ove
the whole front from the Pripe
marshes to the borders of Hungary, ii
indicated by a report that nearl;
20,000 prisoners were taken during i
comparatively quiet period of the las
three days.
German Resistance Weakens.
The increasing proportion of Germai
prisoners contained in the report hai
caused great satisfaction here, when
it is taken as evidence of the gradually
changing spirit ami the decreasing re
sistance of the >rman army.
Gen. Brussiloft. still continues to per
form successfully his well known tac
tics of sharp, unexpected thrusts along
the whole front, changing the point ol
attack with the greatest rapidity, with
the result that the Austro-Germans
according to mililary observers, are ir
continuous suspense and unable tc
withdraw troops from one sector tc
another where for the moment they art
urgently needed.
The most important of Gen. Brus
siloff's recent actions is an advance
toward Brzezany, along the hitherto
unattempted direction midway between
Brody and Halicz, and having for its
object, like all other movements In this
neighborhood, the occupation of Lem
berg.
Now Aim at Lemberg.
Despite the sharp fighting in the re
gion of Vladimir-Volynski, where the
Germans are bringing up all possible
reserves to check the Russian advance
on that town, the principal attention
remains focused for the present upon
the operation in the Lemberg region,
since there now appears to be a greater
chance of taking the capital of Galicia
than the German.center at Kovel. This
possibility, according to the military
experts, has been magnified by Ruma
nia's entry into the war and her en
gagement of a considerable portion of
the Austrian forces, since Transylva
nia and Galicia now constitute the left
and right wings of the same front,
and an advance into Transylvania' will
compel the withdrawal of the Austrian
left wing in Galicia.
The German gas attacks in the re
gion of Baranovichi were apparently
of a local character and without rela
tion to the principal operations on the
southeastern front.
No Cessation of Fighting-.
BERLIN, September 5, via London,
September 6.?There has been no ces
sation of the heavy fighting in Galicia
since the inauguration of the new Rus
sian drive. The official announcement
of today says the Russians attacked
repeatedly yesterday in the vicinity
of Brzezany, fifty miles southeast of
Lemberg, but were driven back by the
German troops.
Official Austrian Report.
An official statement issued by the
Austro-Hungarian army headquarters
under date of September 4 says:
"Archduke Charles' front: The Rus
sians continued by day and by night
their efforts to break the resistance of
the (Teutonic) allies in tjie Carpathi
ans. There were violent engagements
at a number of places. Hostile attacks
were repulsed by our fire, or by bayo
nets or hand grenades.
"Small local Russian successes south
west of Pundul Moldowi and in the
sector of Tartar pass were mostly neu
tralized by counter attacks. The en
emy's losses were heavy.
"Hostile attacks southeast of Brze
