Potatoes Drop

crepancy in Local and
Kansas City Price.
Potatoes were retailing in Oklahoma
City today for what the wholesalers
were asking yesterday, following pub-1
liiation of a story in The Times yes
terday which compared local wholesal
"spud" prices with those at Kansas
City
A local produce dealer announced this
morning that he was selling potatoes to
day at $160 a bushel, wholesal?
They cost him, he said. $1 5.1 delivered
Retailers were' charging from $1 i
i to
Jss a hushcl. I he potatoes w ere a
carload shipped in this morning
Not Good Stock.
Potatoes selling for $1 a bushel,
wholesal?, at Kansas City yesterday,
according to this produce man, were
not of first u,dity. They were seed
potatoes which were brought into Kan
sas City by farmers from the Kaw val
ley. After pun base the whol -salers
are compelled to surt the larger pota
toes from the smaller before they are
marketable
lh:- potatoes rcieivcd here this m,,rn
mg, according to the produce dealer,
shrunk from .i.lliK) (, 5,1 mo pounds
while in transit, which cut his profit
to 5 cents per bushel.
Attempt at Piracy.
Speculators, he declared, came to
him last week with an offer to pur
chase his entire stork at $J a bushel,
on the chance that the proposed nation
wide traffic tieup would occur. He re
fused to sell his supply, he said, out
of a sense of fairness to the consuming
public. He believes that other local
firms were approached by the same food
pirates.
