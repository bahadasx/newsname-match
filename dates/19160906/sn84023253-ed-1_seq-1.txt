Caledonia County Fair is certainly
playing in hard luck this year. It
planned the first of its three days
exhibition as children's day, but yes
terday if a child appeared at the gates
the management had to drive him
away on account of the order of the
state board of health forbidding the
admission of any child under 15
years of age. So the children or their
parents were not present. Then the
management arranged to have seven
carloads of cattle that were exhibited
at the Morrisville fair come here for
exhibition. But the threat of a frieght
strike and the resulting embargo on
freight seemed to block the way for
the exhibitors to get their stock away
from here, and of course they did not
come. Certainly the management is
entitled to tell a hard luck story and
should be given a liberal patronage
today and Thursday to help thern out
of their financial difficulties.
Despite all the discouragements
there is a good exhibition of cattle on
the grounds, floral hall shelters the
best exhibit of its history, a list of
21 horses are ready to start in the five
races and the charioteers are ready to
produce the thrills of a hazardous
chariot race. There will be as good
an exhibition as ha3 been prepared in
northern "Vermont for any who desire
to attend.

Montpelier, Sept. 4. William S.
Peck, aged 86 years, who has been
missing since June 12, was found
about 6 o'clock Monday morning
by S. F. Richardson while looking for
his cows. The body of the old gen
tleman was lying in a swamp in
woods about a mile from Berlin Cor
ners, the village In which he was last
seen on the afternoon of his disap
pearance. The aged man had been In the
habit of taKing ong walks alone and
left his home here about 5.30 o'clock
in the afternoon. He was seen near
the home of J. R. Stewart in Berlin
about 8 o'clock in the evening after
which no trace of him was found al
though his relatives searched the
fields and woods between that place
and Northfield for a week in the hope
of finding him either alive or de
ceased. The swdmp where the body was
found is situated between two roads
and it is thought by some that he
tried to take a short cut through the
pasture of the nearer road leading to
the city.
After Health Officer Andrew Nor

The public health nurse differs
from the visiting nurse in that she
does not care for the sick so much as
tell others what to do, and instruct
the family in some of the details or
nursing. In some New Tork citief
an actual decrease in the death rat

public health nurse. This work U

ciety hopes to have 10 times as many
nurses as are now working in the re
mote districts.
Mr. Moree spoke of the beautiful
ride he had taken Monday morning
to the White Mountains and referred
to this as "the most beautiful part of
America," but said he saw too many
faces with marks of degeneracy and
low mentality, too many wells dan
gerously near the pig pen, and other
evidences of faulty or criminal san
itary arrangements. The public
neaitn nurse can do much to help
such conditions as these. At the close
of his talk Mr. Moree answered ques
tions regarding me iormauon or a
branch of the Red Cross in St. Johns
bury and the steps necessary to hav
ing classes for training of nurses' aids
here. The expense of supporting a
public health r urse would be from
$1200 to $1500 a year.
