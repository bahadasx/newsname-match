W. M. U. CONVENTION.
Pleasant and Rrofitable Session
Held at Gilgal. Goob Re
ports. Hardy's Next
Year.
The W. M. TJ. of Edgefield asso
ciation convened at Gilgal church,
one of the most historic of all Edge
field's places of worship, on the
morning of August 29 at eleven
o'clock.
The morning session was delayed
by the hard rains which discour
aged a great mauy who would have
otherwise attended. All but four
societies, however, were represented,
and the reports were good and the
outlook encouraging.
Miss Alma Williams, president of
the Gilgal society, extended very
gracious and cordial greetings to
all who were present, and made a
splendid and helpful hostess
throughout the sessions.
The secretary, Mrs. Prescott
Lyon, who has served in that capac
ity for a number of years so faith
fully and efficiently, was present at
her post of duty, and strengthened
the courage of the superintendent
uuder the adverse weather condi
tions.
When the Edgefield party reach
ed the church, quite a number had
already arrived, notably the Red
?3k Grove and some of the Red
Hill ladies and Mrs. W. S. Middle
ton of Meriwether, wrho had come
over with two cars full of girls to
aid in her mission study demonstra
tion, "Comrades in Service." This
took place tbe first morning, and
the following took part: Misses
Bell, McKie and Rich and J. T.
Littlejohn, Jr.
The societies were all called upon
to make verbal reports of their
year's work, which proved to be a
very interesting part of the morn
ing's programme.
Among the visitors recognized
jv^re-.-Hw.-i^^Jiv-ZjOa^aadp... &?
Seivern, principal of Edisto acad
emy, and Mrs. J. R. Fizer of Co
lumbia, corresponding secretary of
the South Carolina W. M. 17.
Rev. P. B. Lanham, pastor of
the Gilgal church, made a most
hospitable address, and made every
one feel that he was in hearty sym
pathy and ready to assist in any way
possible.
One of the most inspiring ad
dresses was that made by Rev. Mr.
Cannada on "Christian Education
and Edisto Academy." He asked
the ladies of each society to do
something specific for that purpose,
and suggested that each one pay for
one or more mattresses recently pur
chased for that school. A number
responded to this call.
Social Hour.
The dinner hour at a W. M. U.
gathering is one of the most pleas
ant occasions, because here the
friends who have not seen each
other in many months, perhaps, are
re-united under the most delightful
circumstance?. The* place for the
spreading of the lunch at Gilgal is
cool and shady, just under the edge
of the woods, and invites a long
and lingering meal, especially one
so abundantly and hospitably served.
The women of Gilgal and Berea
churches are specially to be com
mended for their faithfulness, as
many of them had to fix baskets for
the woman's meeting, and also for
the revival meeting at Berea. This
conflict was much regretted, the re
vival meeting also being in progress
at Mt. Zion church.
Sunbeam Session.
The afternoon session was of un
usual interest, in charge of Mrs.
Mamie Tillman, and many bands
were present to give their reports
and chaim and freshness to the
occasion.
The children marched in with
banners and took their seats in the
middle aisle. Eleanor Minis of the
Edgetield band welcomed the sun
beams, Eugenia Brimson respond
ing. Honor roll badges were pre
sented to the Edgetield and Bethany
societies, and the Sunbeam banner
to society first reaching the appor
tionment, was won by Red Hill
Sunbeams, Bethany Sunbeams hav
ing met theirs the following week.
A very interesting feature ot the
program was a silver medal declama
tion contest and one in song entered
by the various sunbeam children
throughout the association.
The winners of the respective
bil ver medals were Boat Strom of
Complete Eleetion Returns
By nine o'clock of the night of the first primary The Ad
vertiser received complete returns from every box in the
county, and we have completed arrangements for receiving
complete returns next Tuesday, xis it will not take long to
count the votes in the second election, complete returns will
be received early from every box in the county.
The Advertiser will also receive telegrams from The State
ffivins the result of the election all over South Carolina.
Rehoboth Sunbeams, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Strom, who was
awarded the declamation medal, and
Joe Major Lyon of the Bethany
Sunbeams for flinging beautifully,
"He is so Precious to Me." All
the contestants were sifted, and the
audience was delighted to see what
the promise of the future is for our
boys and girls, and in another year
two more will have to be winners,
as those who won this year cannot
contest again for a silver medal, but
are in line of promotion for a gold
medal.
The closing feature of the pro
gramme was the trip ' Around the
World with Jack and Janet." told
by Mrs. Tillman introducing visi
tors from the countries around the
world which Jack and Janet had
visited.
Wednesday Morning.
The Young Woman's Auxiliary
programme was in charge of Miss
Emmie Lanham, who has so faith
fully had charge of this department
of work during the past year. Af
ter the societies had made their re
ports and Miss Lanham had distrib
uted apportionment cards and liter
ature for the coming year, Miss
Kellah Fair was called upon to read
the report of the R. A. superinten
dent, Mrs. VV. B. Cogburn, who
was detained and unable to be pres
ent. Mrs. Tillman read at this time
a very interesting lettex-.fxom Mrs. ?
J-*ha L?H 'vhieh-contained ^?Sgpr v^cf^wcot-rJifi.elj.eJroB-,.
ot oiucera, they were caliea up ?ndkf
each one gave some words of good
messages to the women of Edgefield
association.
One of the treats of the associa
tional meeting was the presence of
Mrs. Fizer, who, at this time, gave
a splendid address on the relation
of the W. M. U. to the individual
Baptist woman. This was full of
information and inspiration. She
also made clear the reason for the
Margaret Fund and the Bailey memo
rial, the latter of which was espec
ially appropriate because of the fact
that Dr. Bailey had adopted the
Baptist faith while teaching in the
Gilgal community and was baptized
at Gilgal church.
Closing Session.
After a most refreshing: dinner,
the church was filled again to listen
to a debate, "Resolved that there is
more need for State missions than
for work in our homeland." The
affirmative was presented by Mrs.
W. E. Lott and Mrs. A. B. Young.
Mrs. Lott's paper was very convinc
ing and well presented. Mrs.
Youug's was of an unusual nature
for such a subject, all of her argu
ments being quoted from the Bible
to prove that the base of operations
is the circle nearest home.
In lieu of those who couldn't up
hold the negative side, Mrs. W. J.
Gaines and Miss Jennie Pattison
being absent, Mrs. Allie Timmer
man and Mrs. Fizer were called
upon to give that side impromptu.
This was very effectively done, and
the audience was thoroughly con
vinced that both sides were equally
important, and a great deal more
necessary than they had ever
thought before.
The obituary service was in
charge of Mrs. B. B. Jones, who
read the reports, and as all stood
gave the names of those departed
friends who had left us during the
past 3rear. At the close of the ser
vice "Shall We Gather at the
River" was sung by the congrega
tion, and the meeting adjourned to
convene next year at Hardys church
Tuesday and Wednesday after
the fourth Sunday in August.

At the conclusion of the business

served by the kind hostess.
Kind Hospitality Enjoyed.
Mrs. J. L. Mims, Miss Florence
M ims and Miss Kellah Fair wore
entertained during the W. M. U.
meeting at Gilgal in the home of I
Mr. and Mrs. P. W. Cheatham
where they were royally received.
The evening meal and the morn
ing repast at this happy home were
enjoyed around a hospitable and
bountiful table, with ham as fine as
they have at Colliers, which is say
ing a great deal, and other things
to match.
A scuppernong grape vine was
found here laden with deliciously
flavored frait and a bored well of
mineral water which keeps the fami
ly in continual good health. One of
the ladies asked the name of the
family doctor, fearing that all the
good things enjoyed during the
night and day would necessitate
his presence. The reply was that a
doctor had not been needed by the
family in so long that they did not
have a family doctor. However,
Dr. Pattison was recommended in
case of necessity.
Mr. James Cheatham and Miss
Fannie Lou, the son and daughter,
are the great comfort and joy of
this home.

The Association To-day.
If all of the churches in the asso
ciition sent as large delegations as
tte Edgefield Baptist church, the
good people of Steven's Creek did
n)t have dozens of baskets of din
mr left upon the table after the
feasts, as is generally the case with
Steven's Creek hospitality. We re
ifet that very pressing matters pre
vented our attending the associa
ton, as has been our wont for years,
bit we feel confident that the at
ttndanoe has been large. Those
Steven's Creek people are charming
lusts indeed. The association con
vmed yesterday and will adjourn
tiis afternoon.

des' ready-to wear dresses in silk

RED OAK GROVE.
Rev. George Bussey Preached.
Meeting of Social Circle.
Attended W. M. U. at
Gilgal.
Having enjoyed a feast of good
things for the past two weeks makes
us feel rather inadequate of express
ing our appreciation of so many
privileges.
On yesterday and Saturday p. m.
also our honored pastor Rev. G.
VV. Bussey preached seemingly with
renewed fervor, bringing to us
words of encouragement so uplift
ing leaving his people to feel they
were not striving in vain. His dis
course yesterday was on "Faith" as
the motive power of our being.
The Red Oak Grove Sunday
school will carry our short but in
teresting program on state-wide
go .to Sunday school day fourth
Sunday inst. We will also endeavor
to enlist new members. We
anticipate grading our school,
should our attendance increase for
we feel sure that is a more success
ful method to adopt.
The social circle meeting was
held with much encouragement at
Mrs. Eva Bussey's. This was our
first meeting. We meet twice month
ly. Next meeting at Mrs Fannie
Grifns Otb insc, 4- o'clock p. m.
A goodly number from our
church attended the W. M. U. at
Gilgal. Was quite enjoyable to be
with the good people at Gilgal and
partake of such a welcome that was
extended us, and with Mrs. J. L.
Mims to make every one feel at
ease and composed in her presence.
The meeting was very helpful and
well attended. The meeting together
with friends is so helpful and re
freshing especially to the represen
tatives of the rural societies. Such a
treat to be in the home of Mr. and
Mrs. L. H. Hamilton. Mr. Hamil
ton is a son of Joe and Virginia
:<?1W*j~*L^pJL.re
gressive farmer and stock raiser.
He married Miss Lucy Briggs of
North Augusta, and an ideal home
maker she is. To our mind we were
impressed that reasons for the ex
pression, The hand that rocks the
cradle rulcs?the world" were demon
strated in that home by the little
children kneeling at their mother's
knee in prayer, afterwards a fond
good night to mother and father
being a beautiful illustration. Pros
perity, happiness and righteousness
reigns in that home, planting as its
seed for an encouraging harvest in
future days.
We enjoyed also while there the
company of Miss Jennie Briggs.
Mrs. Hamilton's sister, who has
given her service to the noble work
of suffering humanity. She now id

Miss Maud Quattlebaum one of
Greenwood's most lovable girls has
returned home after a visit to her
uncle, Mr. M all ie Clegg.
Miss Theresa Bunch of Norh Au

good lesson. The young men's
class made a brave start. We are
going to seud out some good men
from this class. William Sharpton
was the first to enrol! in this class.
He is a good scholar and enjoys the
Sunday school.
Gardens are almost cleaned up,
so the housewives are having some
trouble as to what they will give
the hungry men, when they come

cow peas and sweet potatoes. They
are plentiful and we are enjoving
them.
Mr. and Mrs. H. A. Adams and

riage of their son Eugene to Miss
Rhodes. Mrs. Eugenia Middleton

Fie hopes fora quiet rest when it is
ill over.
Mr. J. P. Nixon carried little
John to the hospital last week for
an operation. Ile is getting on nice

always present unless kept away by
sickness and answers to his name
with a verse of scripture.
My the candidates we did have
with us last week! They are not
writing any more letters but come
out in the fields to find us. We are
glad to have them call, as they all
seem to be good fellows. Noone':
i'k?1 ktT?ug"'.^^ r. Vv>.
are glad to see that feeling among
them. None of them use horse and
buggy any more but all come in
autos. Even our magistrates, both

week.
Mrs. H. E. Bunch, the most
charming hostess iu Clark's Hill,
entertained at a little house party
Mrs. Nina Carter of Southwest
Georgia, Miss Helen Pratt of Due
West and a few other friends. We
were invited to be with these charm
ing women. No one^. ever asks if
you had a good time when enter
tained in this horne. They ask
could you take it all m and how
did you manage to get away? On
account of the railroad scare Mrs.
Carter and Miss Pratt had to re
turn home earlier than they ex
pected. Mrs. Carter is a grand
mother but is frequently taken for
her daughter's oldest sister. Her
hands and face are as soft and ten
der as a baby's and her feet and
ankles are the envy of all the girls.
?Some one asked her if she ever did
anything, and she replied: "Why
yes I get up before day and get
breakfast for my boys, help to clean
up the house and do most of my
ironing." When she dresses in the
afternoon she is prettier than any
girl she has. Mrs. Carter and Mrs.
Pratt are half-sisters of Mrs. J. 0.
Marshall.
