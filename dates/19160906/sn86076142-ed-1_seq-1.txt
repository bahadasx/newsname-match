COIIFEREIICE Oil RE1IEIIIIE IS
THE LAST ACI OF CONGRESS
(Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. The only
important work standing in the way
of adjournment, which probably will
take place tomorrow, was smoothing
out today the House and Senate dif
ferences in the emergency revenue
bill providing for raising $205,000,000
annually, the creation of a tariff com
mission and other important eco
nomic principle, i ' . ,
The 'bill passed the Senate last
night and went to the conference
today after the House bad named
conferees. It is believed their report
will accept most of the feenate amend
ments. Including those adopted yes
terday directed against the allied In
terference with American trade.
At the outset the conferees encoun
tered obstacles which will make im
probable final action before tomorrow.
The House conferees Insist on tax
on refined copper, and that the origi
nal munitions tax take tbe place of
the Senate substitute. Another ob
stacle Is the Senate's permanent an
nual appropriation for the tariff com
mission. There has been a lively fight
against the bill, wherein there have
been charges and recriminations on
both sides. The vote to take up does
not necessarily forecast delay In the
adjournment of Congress. It is
planned to adopt a. concurrent reso
lution fixing the adjournment Imme
diately the revenue conferees Indi
cate when they reach an agreement.
This would check the attempted fili
buster on the corrupt practices bill
and end debate.
The Senate decided to take up the
Owen corrupt practices bilL which
would greatly curtail expenditures
and Impose heavy fines for violation
of its terms.
