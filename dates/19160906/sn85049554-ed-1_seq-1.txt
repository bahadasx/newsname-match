House and Senate Con
ferees Can Not Agree on
Revenue Measure.
OBSTACLES FOUND
IN AMENDMENTS
Senate Kills Time by Taking Up Cor­
rupt Practices Bill, With Little* Pros
pect of Passage at This Session—
Severe Penalties Attached For Vio
lation of. Terms—Aimed ta Regulate
Campaign Expenditures. •'••T-*'«
"Washington. Sept. fc—'Prospects for
adjourning congrcss today went glim
mering when the house and senate
conferees, began informal discussions
on the revenue bill.
The conferees found some obstacles
which it is hoped will be smoothed out
tomorrow. The senate having nothing
else to do, took up the Owen corrupt
practices bill, but democratic leaders
said it had -no chance, of passage and
would be put aside whenever adjourn
ment could be secured.
Washington, Sept. 6.—The senate
today decided by a vote of 32 to 14 to
take up Senator Owen's corrupt prac
tices bill, which would greatly curtail
campaign expenditures and impose
heavy penalties for violations of its
teirms."
Seven republicans voted with demo
crats to take up the bill and seven
democrats voted against it. There has
been a lively fight against-the bill,
during which there have been chfjrges
and recriminations from both sides.
The vote to take it up today does not
necessarily forecast delay in adjourn
ment of cor.gress. The senate tools It
up, as it had noithing^elae beforerit.
Republican leaders insisted they would
never let it reach a vote..
It was planned to, adopt a concurrent
resolution fixing the lime for adjourn
ment as soon as the revenue confer
ees can reach a time when they
will meet and agree. Such a resolu
tion would check any -attempted fili
buster on the corrupt practices bill
and end debate.
Xhe byi .was caaied 'iAP on qfotlorvby
Democratic'Leader -feitChin to send" it
to conference. Republican^ Leader
Mann wanted time to read it and Mr.
Kitchin temporarily withdrew the
motion. "With Representatives Rainey,
of Illinois, and Dixoh. of Indiana, rank
ing democratic members, he went over
to the senate for an informal confer
ence on the bill.
Encounter~ Obstacles.
At the outset the conferees en
countered ^-several o,lstacles which
made ir improbable that final action
can be taken before tomorrow.
House conferees insist on the tax
on refined copper and the original
munition tax in place of the senate
substitute. Another obstacle is the
provision for a permanent tariff com
mission. The house merely offered an
appropriation after 191". but the senate
made it mandatory.
Representative Fitzgerald, chairman
of the appropriation committee, seek
ing assurances that the permanent ap*
propriation for future years be
dropped, said today he would not per
mit a report in the house on the gen
eral deficiency bill until that was
agreed to.

British'Embargo.
Chicago, fiept, Two "dottlfW*
Zeppelins, each with a da&jnMt
capacity of sixty torn have been «on
structod In Germany to carry matt-to* jj
tween Berlin and the United data* in
seventy-two ihours, according' toHorria
Epstein, who returned ito Chicago
yesterday after several months piasiwl
In Europe. Mr. Epetein said he had
seen both the giaxvt aircraft, ona
christened Aanerlka and tho oither
Deutachland.
"The neiw merchant Zeppelins are
700 feet long and" unarmed,"^ Mr. Bp
stein explained. "The cairlage re
sembles the hull of a ship and la
floated by two huge #as bags Instead
of one single bag, as in the case of the
Zeppelins now in use. The Zeppelins,
which will carry mall only, are
scheduled to make the trip In seventy-'
two hours.
Charge Extra Postage.
"In Germany the regular postage
and a mark additional will be charged
on all mall for the United States. In
the United States, postage to Germany
on these ships will be the regular 2
cents and 25 cents additional. Each
ship can carry sixty tons of mail.
"As Xor hostile aeroplanes, the ships
can rise to an altitude higher than any
so far reached by heavier than air ma
chines/ Once inside the three-mile
limit on the Atlantic coast of the
United States, the Zeppelins will de
scend anil come In on the water, to
meet the requirements oif our statutes."
According to Mr. Epstetn, diplomatic
circles in Berlin believe that Eric von
Falkcnlinyn, the recently removed chief
of the -general staff. Is slated to succeed
Von Bethmann-Hollweg aa Imperial
chancellor.
Why Change Was Made.
"Official Germany feels that Von
Bethmann-Hollweg is too weak and
open to meet the tricky policies of Eng
land," Mr. Epstein said. "For thla rea
son Von Hlndenburg, who Is Idolized by
the army and the people, was made
chief of the general staff, and Von Fal
kenhayn Is being trained to succeed the
prosent chancollor.
"People In the United States appear
to be surprised by the appointment of
Von Hlndenburg. I knew six weeks ago
that he was going to DO appointed.
"Everybody has faith in the army,
and tho soldiers I talked with, altho
they are tired of the war and ready to
welcome peace, are determined to fight
until their enemies recognize defeat.
Seventy million Germans are taxing
their brains every day to help the fath
erland.
Many Men Available.
"As to military matters, nobody but
tho jftneral staff knows how many sol
diers Germany has In the field. So far
nobody under 19 has been sent to the
front. All under 19 are being held in
reserve In the cities and I think It Is
safe to say that there are as many men
available for servlco as there are now
In the field.
