AUTO ACCIDENT
PROVES FATAL
Charles H. Sandberg, the Well
Known Traveling Salesman of
Warren, Meets Instant Death
When Car Upsets.
An auto accident that suddenly
shocked the people of Warren and
brought the deepest sorrow to a hap
py home, occurred last Thursday
evening, when the Ford car which
was owned and driven by Charles H.
Sandberg, the well known travelling
salesman for Foley Bros. & Quinlan,
of St. Paul, tipped over pinning him
underneath and instantly crushing
out his life. Riding with Mr. Sand
berg in the car was Mr. C. J.
Pen-row
dergast, of Minneapolis, also a sales
man for the same house.
In an interview with a Sheaf re
porter on Friday afternoon, Mr.
Pendergast erplained the accident in
the following manner:
"The time of tne accident was
about 9:30 in the evening and took
place about four and a half miles
south of Thief River Falls. The
road was in good condition until we
reached this spot, whsre we struck
loose gravel and sand, which caused
the car to swerve and skid. We
were not traveling at a great speed.
I should judge it was in the neigh
borhood of twenty miles an hour.
The first time the car skidded I be
came nervous, so I opened the door
on the side of the car and was ready
to jump in case it should head for
the ditch. In a short while it skidded
again, much worse than the first
time, so I made one jump just as
the car tipped over. I landed on
both feet, but the sudden stop trew
me back on my head. The blow ren
dered me unconscious for about 10
minutes. After regaining my senses
my first thoughts were of Mr. Sand
berg, who was under tha car, only a
few inches from the spot where I
landed. I lit several matches, but a
strong wind blew thet out, so I
could not see anything. Then I tried
to lift the car, but found the task
"Peeing, a lighi
too mud* for
a nearby farm
for assistance. Arriving at the
house, I told of the accidei and then
fainted, according to the story of the
farmer later on. Another auto came
along about this time and seeing
the tipped over car went to the same
farm house for help. The people in
the second car, with the a.^lp of the
farmer, went to the road and right
ed the car and found the dead body
of Mr. Sandberg underneath. While
they were doing this, I was at the
farm house, as the sho:k of the acci
dent me a nervous wreck temporori
ly. The coroner was notified and
the body was taken to Thief River
Falls.
"The story which appeared in one
of the Thief River Falls papers the
next day was printed without any
foundation of facts and moreover
they say that their reporter had an
interview with me. As far I know
this is untrue. They should be
criticized for printing a story with
out endeavoring to secure the real
facts.
Mr. Sandberg, who had just visit
ed his home here in Warren, was
that day travelling in his car and
calling on the trade in St. Hilaire
and other towns in that vicinity.
When the accident occurred he was
on the way from St. Hilaire to Thief
River Falls. As soon as news of
the accident reached Thief River
TTalls friends there arranged for the
proper care and embalming of the
body, which was shipped to Warren
on, the Soo on Friday morning. Here
it -was met by a delegation of the
Warren Masonic Lodge, of which de
ceased was a member, and under its
auspicies the funeral arrangements
were made and conducted. On Sat
urday afternoon, Sept. 1, at 2 P. M.daughter
the funeral was held from the late
home of deceased and was largely
attended by friends and relatives, in
eluding the aged parents of deceased
from town of Vega, carrying their
eighty years and still apparently
hale and hearty. The services at thenear
house were conducted by Rev. F. N.
Anderson in Swedish and by Rev. D.
Samson in English. At the cemetery
the services were conducted by thethe
Masons, Mr. W. N. Powell officiating.
Charles Herman Sandberg was
born in Sweden Dec. 28, 1868, hence
/his age was 48 years, nearly. With
jr"his parents he came to America in
11*1880 or thereabouts, the father tak
ing up a homestead in town of Vega,
^-this county. Young Sandberg came
jlP'to Warren when he was still in his
teens and started to work in the
store of'G. G. Winchester* where he
-was continually employed as long as
"the store was in existence, or for
about a period of fifteen years.
This long service speaks dr his
faithfulness and devotion to the in
terests of his employer. Later he
was for a short time with the War
ren Mercantile Co. He wes an ex
'ceptionally capable salesman and
'this fact was in time recognized by
wholesale houses. During a number
of years past now he has been em
ployed as a travelling salesman by
Foley Bros. & Quinlan, a well known
St. Paul wholesale grocery house.
Deceased was a most genial man
and possessed the happy faculty of
making and keeping friends. He is
most deeply mourned by his devoted
wife and one son, Roger, who is a
student in the Warren High School.
He is also mourned by a brother,
John Sandberg, of Vega, and, as be
fore stated, by his aged parents,
whose gray hairs by his sudden and
untimely death are brought with sor
nearer to their own grave. The
sad death of Mr. Sandberg should be
a warning to us all of the uncertain
ty of human life. To the bereaved
this community offers its most
heartfelt sympathy. May they be
given strength from on high to bear
their irreparable loss.

THE SEED CORN VISION
W
Tabor, in
GET BUSY IN SEED-CCHN TIME AND* IT WILL CO!
HEN every corn grower in Minne
sota straps a sack over his shoul
ders and goes into the cornfield
before frost to select seed for planting
next year's crop, the prospective an
nual yield will be increased 15,000,000
bushels. This will add $7,500,000 to the
state's wealth every year, and the in
crease will go into the pocket of the
FARMER WHO PRODUCES IT.
HERE IS THE SITUATION: For
the last five years the yield of corn
in Indiana hap \een 36.7 bushels to the
acre. The yield in Iowa and in Wis
consin has been 35.2. The yield
Minnesota has been 33.2. THE
TROUBLE IS the growing season for
the corn that is grown in Indiana,
Wisconsin and Iowa is too short for
the corn that is grown in Minnesota
and a variety must be perfected that
will mature from ten to thirty days
earlier
A variety of corn that would fully
mature before frost would add FIVE
BUSHELS TO EVERY ACRE of corn
raised in Minnesota. The way to get
corn that will mature in time is to
GET AN EARLY START IN THEto
SPRING WITH A VARIETY THAT
WILL MATURE IN 100 TO 120 DAYS,
and the way to get this variety is to
SELECT THOROUGHLY MATURED
SEED FROM THE FIELD BEFORE
FROST.

$90,000 DITCH TO
BE ORDERED SOON
Judge Watts Will Issue Order
Soon As Amended Report
Is Made.
As
It is probable that the application
for the construction of a $90,000
judicial ditch in Roseau and Mar
shall county will be allowed by
Judge Watts in the course of a few
days.
At the hearing recently held in
Roseau, there was some objection to
the establishment of the ditch by
residents on the lower part of the
Roseau river, who claimed that the
river was not large enough to take
care of the water that would be
poured into it when the new ditch
was completed. There are some
amendments to be made to the en
gineer's report and it is probable
that as soon as the amended report
is handed to the clerk of court and
placed on file Judge Watts will issue
an order for the construction of the
drainage ditch. The building of the
will effect some lands in Mar
shall county thus making it a judi
cial ditch.-*-Crookston Times.

wheat crop produced 38,931,000 bush
els. Her winter wheat crop gave 714,
000 bushels.
If these yields were placed on the
market -at August 1 prices, the corn
crop would be worth $11,672,550 more
than the entire wheat crop in Minne
sota this year.
Acre for acre, good corn yields
nearly twice as many pounds of feed
as barley, oats or rye. Clover grows
well in nearly every part of Minne
sota and thousands of tons of alfalfa
are raised every year Isn't it worth
wMle to try to make the crop ev^n
better
A yield of thirty bushels of corn to
the acre about pays for raising corn.
A yield of thirty-five bushels gives a
profit of about $2 50. The addition
to the crop made by the selection of
good seed and the care for it during
the winter means additional profit
MINNESOTA'S CORN CROP MAY
BE MADE TO AVERAGE FORTY
BUSHELS TO THE ACRE. It will
do that when every corn grower
spends a day for every ten acres he
plants SELECTING HIS SEED FROM
THE FIELD AND STORING IT, SO as
get a good stand of strong grow
ing corn that will mature.
.Seed Corn Time comes September
10 to 20. Put in two days or more
selecting and storing seed corn dur
ing that time and repeat next jear
and the next and every year as long
as you are in the business of corn
growing.

SENATOR NELSON
ADMINISTERS A ROAST
Shows Up Fallacy of Adamson 8-
Hour Law and Other Dem
ocratic Legislation.
Washington, Sept. 4"I cannot
emit referring to the gi\a'est legis
lative glory of the demoviatic prrty
this session in the pass'n** of a lav
to increase by legislative fiat the
wages of a certain class of railroad
employes 25 per cent over what they
are receiving now," said Senator
Knute Nelson, with interee sarcasm
in a speech in the senate to-day on
the legislative record of the adminis
tration. "This is the culmination of
democratic wisdom in the field of
legislation.
Test of Time.
"Time will tell whether this bill
will be of any personal advantage to
those who held us by the throat and
to strike, and whether it
will help democracy to secure the re"prized
election of Woodrow Wilson. One
thing is certain, that if the increased
wages are sustained and allowed it
will of necessity impose a great ad
ditional burden upon the farmers
and producers of the country. The
ultimate burden will fall upon them.
This is a piece of the so-called con
structive legislation of the demo
cratic party."
Other Laws Reviewed.
Senator Nelson reviewed the tariff
and war revenue laws, the currency
legislation, the trade commission act,
the Clayton act, the child labor law
and the ship purchase law.
"The avowed purpose of the tariff
law was to destroy protection and to
produce revenue," he'said. "It
wasput
successful as a destroyer of protec
tion but an utter failure as a revenue
provider. 1894, this democratic tariff act of
produced deficiency of reven-
ues."

SMALL GAME SEASON
OPENS THURSDAY.
As has been customary in the past
years, Warren will again send out a
large army of hunters in quest of
the elusive prairie chicken, when the
season opens tomorrow morning.
To-day the local sportsmen are
making preparations for the mor
row's hunt and are polishing the old
shot gun, which for a whole year has
lain in its case. The numerous hunt
ing dogs in this city are now the
center of attraction and sense their
duty of going out in the fields in the
morning for the purpose of pointing
the prairie hen, which is so much
by the men, who hunt.
County Auditor Lundgren has is
sued, up to two o'clock this after
noon, 116 licenses for hunters and
by the time the season opens Thurs
day, it is say to say that 25 addi
tional licenses will be taken out.
The scarcity of chickens this year
will prevent hunters from coming
home with large bags of game. The
cold and wet spring is the cause of
the limited number of game.
Elevator Improvements Completed.
The Warren Milling Company has
recently re-constructed their elevator
in this city and are now in a posi
tion to promptly handle all grain de
livered to them. Among other
changes, a new foundation has been
in and a larger pit for receiving
the loads of grain and a larger cup
elevator system have been installed.
With this equipment added the War-
like the democratic tariff* law" of ren Milling Co. has~ greatly increased
their facilities for handling grain
and, respectfully solicit a fair share,
'of the farmers' patronage..'
