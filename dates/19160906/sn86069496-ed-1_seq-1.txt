SKETCHES. I
S. C. Neat.
Speaking of Commercial travelers,
there are but few better known sales
men than the subject; of this notice.
He is now a middled age man and has
been on the road almost constantly
since he reached his majority, and dur
ing his experience as a traveling sales
man he has represented several differ
ent houses. His longest stay, with
any one house, was with Otter & Co.,
Louisville, who a year or two since de
cided to discontinue salesmen on the
road. Mr. Neat was a valuable man,
and leaving Otter & Co. he accepted a
position .with Altschler & Co., a lead
ing grocery house of the same city,
and has been an. active solicitor for
said firm for about twelve months
He is well-known throughout this
part of the State, his efforts having
won a very satisfactory trade. Mr.
Neat is not only polite and accomo
dating to the merchants whom he
sells, but to the public generally,
hencs he is a very popular gentleman,
no salesman in this section having
more friends, socially and in the busi
ness walks of life. He is delighted to
do business for the firm he now repre
sents, as it is one of the strongest in
the city, and so far as he knows it is
well pleased with his efforts.
Mr. Neat is a native of Adair, be
ing a son of former State Senator W.
F. Neat. He grew to manhood on a
farm and now has cultivated a very
good little plantation which he owns,
four miles out of Columbia. He is a
member of the Christian Church. Ha
married early in life and believes the
Bible from lid to lid, and was strongly
impressed with the injunction, multi
ply and replenish the earth, and his
offsprings have been coming every
two years until he is the father of
nine children, eight girls and one boy.
To comfortably care for them re
quires pluck and energy, both of
whioh Schuyler has Here is hoping
that he may be blessed w ith good
health, that he may live to a good old
age, his children and companion,
bringing sunshine throughout his
life. He is scrupulously honest, a
priceless heritage he will leave to his
children besides a good home.
If you want to sell your mules bring
them to Columbia next Friday.
Public Sale of Young Stock.
On Friday, the 15th of September, I
will sell at public outcry the following
stock. Two well broke 3 year old
mules, good ones, two 4 year old mules,
two bay mares 8 years old, four 2 year
old heifers, two extra milch cows,
hogs and sheep, also farming imple
ments. Sale will be held on my farm
2 miles west of Jamestown and will
begin promptly at 10 a. m. Six or

agent, Mr. E. H. Hughes, last Friday,

Wilson now lives. Mr. Gowdy will
erect a wholesale house on the lot.
The consideration for the property is
private.
Large congregations heard Dr.
Frank CheaV, of Danville, at the
Presbjterlan church, this place, last
Sunday forenoon and evening. The

delighted with his coming.

We are sending out statements to
all subscribers to this paper who owe
over one dollar. If we do not receive
a remittance in a reasonable length of
time the paper will quit going 'to'
those who owe over said amount.
Monday week will be the opening
of the Adair circuit court. The Sep
tember term usually brings a large
crowd. There will probably be a lot
of mules and cattle on the market,
The railroad is confined for the
present, but is being tenderly nursed,
and with the proper care it is now re
ceiving, will be in the front ranks
soon.
Born, to the wife of W. 1. Ingram,
en. the 29th of August, a son. At this
time the mother and baby are getting
aloag nicely.
Road Work Pushed.
Work on the Columbia and Liberty
road is now being pushed and from
present indications the money avail
able will be sufficient to build a splen
did road from Columbia to Purdy.
This distance covers the roughest and
most costly part of the entire road
and offers a'splendid outlet and inlet
to the Blue Gras3 counties, save about
two miles from the Neatsville bridge
to the top of dug hill. If this dis
tance was graded the upper part of
this county and Columbia would be
brought in closer touch resulting in
good to both sections It would also
give an unobstructed outlet from Co
lumbia to Liberty and that entire
part of the State. There being no
money available for this purpose we
believe that a volunteer force will
meet the requirements at the proper
time. We have suggested such a move
to many on this end of the line as well
as to those in the upper part of the
county. Everyone says it ought to
be doue and that they will help do it.
The people at Pellyton, Neatsville and
vicinity are anxious to get this grade
established and a good roadbuilt. They
are ready to join in making the grade
and willing to begin grading the road
as soon as possible there being thou
sands of loads of fine gravel as ever
was used on a road convenient for the
work. In view of the importance of
this opening, in view of saving the es
tablished grade now shown by the re
cent survey, it has been decided to ask
every enterprising man ab both ends
of the line and all alone the road to
meet at the top of dug hill on the first
Monday in November for this purpose.
Later on an organization will be made
to do this work to the best advantage.
This town ought to join in this move
ment with vim and enthusiasm. It
is not a big or costly undertaking and
if met as it should be two or three
days will open a broad path. The
County Judge will furnish all blast
ing materials needed, the people ought
to do the rest. Magistrates Ellis and
Shepherd are enthusiastic and will do
all within their power to accomplish
it. Let's open the road to Liberty!

surance company, "Insurance Com

L. C. Hind man Re-elected
Overseer.
Road
The Fiscal Court met last Saturday,
inspected the road work and being
highly pleased, re-elected Mr. L. C.
Hindman as master overseer. Mr.
Hindman had tendered his resignation
the day before, but on the ensistency
of interested parties in the building
of the road he consented to continue
the work if the people on the road
and the court desired his services and
were willing to make a moderate in
crease in his salary. There was no
mistaking the fact that abundant ev
idence existed to warrant the court in
the decision to continue him in
charge. The work done met tne
hearty approvar of the magistrates
and convinced that Mr. Hind
man was giving splendid results for
the money being used, stated that
they must retain him and were not
willing to make a change and we say
it was a wise decision.

Opening of the Lindsey-Wilson.
This well-known institution opened
this Tuesday forenoon with a full
faculty. We learn from the principles
that- the prospects were never better
for a full school. The buildings are
all in a good sanitary condition, and
the grounds are the most beautiful in
the State. Boarders have already
commenced coming in and in a very
few weeks the hill will be alive with
boys and girls. The management has
arranged to comfortably care for all
who choose to come. Electric lights
and water works in the dormitories,
and all rooms well ventilated. A num
ber of short addresses were made at
the opening.
Struck Oil.
A few days ago while a lot of hands
were blasting out rock for road pur
poses, on the land where theZion
church building is located, they came
to a pool of oil. It was dipped and put
in a bottle, and some of it was set on
fire. It burned like all other crude
petroleum. Many years ago oil specu
lators gave it as there opinion that
petrolium could be found in this lo
cality. It is likely that a thorough
investigation will he made. This in
formation comes from Mr. John C.
Holladay, a reliable man.

A Green River Farm for Sale.
