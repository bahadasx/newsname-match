PROTECTION FOR
ENGLISHWORKER
Union Men of Great Britain
Now Demanding a
Tanff Wall
Birmingham, England, Sept 6. 3
p. m. The Trades Union Congress,
representing nearly 2,500,000 organiz
ed workers of Great Britain, took an
important and unexpected step today
by adopting, with a majority of more
than 1,000,000 votes, a resolution vir
tually endorsing the principles o
protection.
The resolution asks for "the adop
tion of methods for restricting or pre
venting the importation of cheap
manufactured goods produced at low
er rates of wages and under worse
labor conditions than proved in
this country."
Although these words themselves
accept tho principle of a protective
tariff wall, the protectionists among
the labor delegates and in other cir
cles are not Inclined to regard the
workmen as having been won over to
a complete. change from free trade.

REVENUE BILL
BEFORE HOUSE
House Conferees Insist on Tax
on Refined Copper and
Munitions Tax.
Washington, Sept, 6. The only im
portant piece of work standing in the
way of adjournment which probably
will occur tomorrow or possibly even
late tonight, was the smoothing out
today of house and senate differences
on -the administration emergency rev
enue bill providing for the raising of
.$205,000,000 annually, the creation of a
tariff commission and other Important
economic principles.
The bill was called up at tho out
set of the session of the house by a mo
tion of Democratic Leader Kltchln to
sent it to conference. Republican
Leader Mann wanted time to read the
bill and Mr. Kitchin temporarily with
drew the motion. With Representa
tives Rainey of Illinois and Dixon of
Indiana, Democrat ranking members
of the ways and means committee, he
went over to the senate for an inform
al conference on the bill.
Pending developments, Mr. Kitchin
withheld the concurrent resolution for
adjournment of congress, but ox
pressed the opinion that It probably
would adjourn tomorrow.
At the outset the conferees injected
several obstacles which make Improba
ble that final action can be taken be
fore tomorrow.
House conferees insist on the tax on
refined copper and the munitions tax
in the place of the senate substitute.
Another obstacle is the senate per
manent annual appropriation tor a
tariff commission. The house merely
authorized the appropriation after
1917, but the senate made it manda
tory. Representative Fitzgerald, chairman
of the appropriation committee, seek
ing assurances that the appropriation
for future years bo dropped said to
day, ho would permit a report In the
house on the general deficiency bill
, until that was agreed to.
This bill passed last night in the
senate by a vote of 42 to 16 with
five Republicans voting for It went to
conference today as soon as the house
had gone through the formality of
naming its conferees, several of whom
have been working on It Informally for
the last few days. It Is believed their
report will accept most senate amend
ments Including those adopted yester
day directed against allied Interfer
ence with American trade.

Hungarian. Diet Holds. Stormy
Session Premier Tisza
' ,Sure of Success of
Hungary.
London, Sept. 6. According to a
Budapest telegram, says the Reuter
correspondent at Amsterdam, yester
day's session o'f the Hungarian diet
was an extremely stormy one. When
Premier Tisza entered the house he
was greeted with loud shouts of "re
sign" from the party of Count Mich
ael Karolyi. The three other oppo
sition -parties remained quet.
When order was restored, Premier
TiBzal, who was repeatedly Interrupt
ed, said the attitude of the Rumanians
'Hfas without precedent in the history
o the world and that he hoped meas
ures .which ' had been taken would
shorty bear fruit.
"Rumania will not escape her fate,"
the" premier is quoted as declaring.
' am,' copfldent that we will win this
war on all frontiers. Our duty is to
maintain the unity of Hungary in
its fight for existence."
Ex-Premier Count Julius Andressy
agreed that the entire .energy of the
nation should be exerted in the fight
which was in self-defense, but crit
icised the manner In which the gov
ernment carried on its business and,
its lack of foresight. The position -of
the country, the ex-premler saidivas
serious, but not critical, whftle ne had
conffdonce in the outcome, their must
be a new iiea'dciiJhip.
