Gain's said:
"Reports that have come in from
aver the state from members of the
state committee, from the chairmen
of the several congressional commit
tees and from the chairmen of the
county committees, are very encourag
ing. There is no doubt that the situa
tion of the Republican party in West
Virginia is better today than ii was
at a similar date in 3904, 1908 or 1912.
This view of the situation is not based
upon any feeling of over-confidence
on the parf of the committee or on#
the part of Republicans generally
throughout the state. On the contrary,
It. With that we are sure to win
the state committee Is busy and pro
poses to keep busy until the returns
ore in: that all the other Republican
committees throughout the state and
the Republicans generally are alive,
awr.'iie. alert and determined. A cam
paign is in sight with the whole force
of a united Republican party back of

service companies opportunity to pre
i pare their lines for the paving.

when they will be abandoned so as
not to be in the way of the paving
contractor.

When a Pocket of Oil is Struck
on the Highland Farm Near
West Milford.
ONE MOST SURE TO DIE
While the Other's Condition is
Such That He, Too,
May Die.
Resulting from an oil and gas ex
plosion and fire which occurred at
7 o'clock Wednesday morning on the
Highland farm near West Milford,
where Flint and Strother, oil and gas
well contractors, were drilling a well
for the Vesper Gas Company, Frank
M. Clauseon, of Adamston, driller,
and George Cornell, of 7CO Mulberry
street, a tool dresser, are patients in
St. Mary's hospital suffering from
burns which in all probability will
prove fatal to Clausson and may
prove fatal for Cornell.
Strike Oil Pocket.
According to a story told by Mr.
Cornell at the hospital at noon Wed
nesday he and Clausson had just fin
ished dressing a bit when they struck
a pocket of oil and it flowed to the
top of the derrick. The oil ignited
from the fire in the forge, and the
oil set off the gas. An explosion fol
lowed and it was heard for miles
around. Houses a half mile away
were shaken by the explosion.
Men working on other wells on the
farm hearing the explosion and seeing
the fire ran to the assistance of the
men. George Holmos, a driller, the
first to reach the scene, found Claus
son near the boiler house where he
was working when the explosion oc
curred. Clausson's clothes were all
on fire and It took Holmes several
minutes to get the fire put out. He
rolled Clausson in the grass and in
this manner finally extinguished the
llames.
Tears off Clothing.
By this lime several other men
were on the scene and they looked
around the well for Cornell but could
not find him. They then thought that
he might have been in the rig when
the explosion occurred and was dead.
However, some of the men started to
search for him around the well and
he was found about fifty yards away,
where he had run after his clothing
caught fire. He had taken his burn
ing clothes off as he ran away from
the well and was almost nude when
found.
Rushed to Hospital.
A physician was summoned and
both men were rushed to- St. Mary's
hospital where their Injuries wore
dressed,
