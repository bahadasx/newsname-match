r CHURCH IS -MERE POSSIBILITY"
So Says the Rev. C. C. Grimes of Ru
mored $12.,KMI Church.
That the erection of a new Metho
dist Church for Columbia, costing
$123,000 and. large enough to accom
odate the local membership and the
hundreds of Methodist students that
come to the University every year, is
a mere possibility is the opinion ex
pressed this mornirg by the Rev. C.
C. Grimes, pastor of the church here.
Although the plans for the new
structure have been recommended by
a commission, appointed by the three
conferences of the state to supervise
the work of the Methodist students in
school here, the proposition has only
been approved hy one of the confer
ences thus far. That was by the Mis
souri Conference at a meeting of that
body last week in Fayette. The Rev
erend Grimes said this morning that
the other two conferences in the state
will meet sometime next month and
that the matter would be brought to
the attention of these bodies then.
Ho stated, however, that it was not
probable that anything definite would
be determined at these meetings.
"The matter of erecting this build
ing has been in the air for about three
ypars and we have never been able
to take any definite steps in that di
rection," said the Reverend Grimes.
"Since there are between 1,000 and
1.200 Methodist students here every
year we consider the school here a
sort of state parish. There is no ques
tion that we should have the new-
church but of course if it is built the
money must come from the Methodists
from all over the state."
WATER SUPPLY IS PLENTIFUL
Incoming of Students Wont Re Felt,
Sas flavor Ratterton.
Columbia will be prepared to fur
nish the increase in water needed
when the University students arrive
during the next two weeks.
"I have inspected the water plant,
and everj thing is in good condition,"
said Mayor Batterton this morning.
"We have seven wells, and only five
are in use. There is several feet of
water In the lake, which shows that
we have a surplus. We have the new
machinery ready to put in order, and
arc now waiting on a meter. Thi3
will arrive before the students get
back.
"Only three wells will be used when
we use the compressed air svstem, as
this is more dependable, and will in
sure all the water needed. We then
have four wells to fall -back on, in
case of any emergency."
"The station is in good shape to
handle the increase that will be need
ed," said Superintendent Fawks, this
morning. "Our new machinery can be
installed in the very near future, and
we have been gaining with the old
machinery, so we will have a plenti
ful supply of water."

COUNCIL WON'T DIM
AUTOMOBILE LIGHTS
Allton, Hawkins, McDonald
and Reed Against Lee
Walker's Measure.
FINAL VOTE IS 4 TO 2
Meeting Is Held This After
noon to Take Up Sex
ton Road Paving.
By a vote of four to two the city
council last night defeated the bill
providing that automobile lights should
be hooded or dimmed while running
on brightly lighted city streets. The
measure was introduced by Council
man Walker.
City Attorney Starrett in explain
ing the measure which he had drawn
up, stated that there were some diffi
culties In the way of making the bill
exact owing to the variety of light3
and the special cases that would come
up. The majority of the council
seemed to think the ordinance un
necessary and hard to put into ef
fect.
Councilman Shaw- thought the
measure would be a means of educat
ing the people to automobile courte
sies and would make traffic at night
safer. He was the only one besides
Walker to vote for the bill, while All
ton, Hawkins, McDonald and Reed
voted against it.
The matter of the Mount Vernon
sewer again came up for discussion.
Councilman Shaw said that he had
gone over the matter with the city
engineer and was working on a re
arrangement of the district by cutting
off certain streets and retaining oth
ers that would give adequate drain
age to the whole district.
The city attorney said he could cor
rect errors in a contract with the Wa
bash Railroad in regard to a spur
owned by the city.
The council decided to meet this
afternoon to accept the city engi
neer's report on the paving and grad
ing of Sexton road, as some work re
mained to be done this morning.
Whittle and Hockaday were grant
ed the contract for supplying coal for
the Water and Light Plant. George
Barkwell was given the contract for
building the reinforced concrete cul
vert on Park avenue between Seventh
and Eighth streets.
The petition of John V. Jones, ask
ing that his name be stricken from
any remonstrance against the im
provement of Hickman avenue, was
filed.
The council allowed accounts as
follows: $345.13 out of the water and
light fund for salaries and accounts;
$352.50 for accounts against the se
curity fund; $2315.43 out of the gen
eral revenue fund for salaries of po
lice, police judge, jailor, etc.; $33.75
from the poor fund.

DANIEL BOONE TAVERN
LEASED TO i t
F. W. Leonard Gets Contract
for Running Columbia's
New Hotel.
LEASE FOR 10 YEARS
Lessee Was Formerly Con
nected With Southern
Hotel in St. Louis.
Boyle G. CJark, President of the L.
W. Dumas, Jr., Construction Com
pany, today said the Daniel Boone
Tavern has been leased to F. W.
Leonard of Kansas City. The build
ing has been leased to Mr. Leonard
for a term of ten years with the
privilege of renewing his lease for an
additional five years, and he will take
possession of the building as soon as
it is completed.
Mr. Leonard will conduct the ho
tel and have the privilege of subrent
ing the store room, billiard room and
barber shop in the building.
"I think we have been very for
tunate in getting Mr. Leonard as the
proprietor of the Daniel Boone Tav
ern," said Mr. Clark. "For sixteen
years he was assistant manager of
the Southern Hotel in St. Louis, and
has been manager of the Sexton Ho
tel of Kansas City.
"We had a number of applications
for the lease of this building. Mr.
Leonard has a wide 'acquaintance in
Missouri and knows quite a good
many people in Columbia, and is an
experienced hotel man.
"Mr. Leonard submitted to us his
specifications for the furnishing of
the hotel and showed us samples of
the furniture that he proposed to in
stall. The building will be furnished
in first class shape, will have all
modern conveniences, and will be a
first-class hotel in every respect
"The estimate we have on the kind
of Jj'rnlMire jr Leonard proposes to
place in the building is $25,000, which
the hotel men whom we have con
sulted say will furnish the building
in first-class order. The furnishings
of the bed-rooms, dining-room and
cafe will be comparable to the new
Westgate Hotel in Kansas City. In
the lobby, and offices the idea will
be to carry out the spirit of the Dan
iel Boone Tavern in the furnishing
as near as possible.
"Mr. Leonard intends to run the
business himself and will shortly
move to Columbia to make this place
his home. He has disposed of his
interest in Kansas City and will be
ready to open the hotel in Columbia
as soon as it is completed, which we
hope will be by March 1. We have
been delayed somewhat in the carry
ing on of the work due to our ina
bility to get reinforcing steel. We
have a sufficient quantity of this on
hand now, and if we succeed in get
ting the other material as we need it
we will be able to complete the build
ing by March 1."

l. S. TO CONFER WITH ALLIES
RlaeMist Will Re Taken Up Following

By Tiilted Press.
WASHINGTON, Sept. C. A short
diplomatic conference between the
Allied governments and the United
States is expected to follow retalia
tory measures incorporated in the
revenue bill passed by the Senate late
last night. With agreement to the
amendment by the House conference
committee, it is thought the Allied
governments probably led by Great
Britain may begin sharp 'counter-re
taliations. The belief of many of
ficials, however, Is that the conflict
will be strictly commercial.
It is said on the other hand that
the United States government is go-
ing into the issue with Its eyes open.
prepared to see itself through. The
course decided upon legislation .that
hits directly back at every discrimi
nation pronounced against American
shipping interests grew out of thor
ough consideration by the State De
partment and other executive depart
ments of the probable consequences,
it was declared today.
It 13 the hope of the administration,
one official said, that the drastic leg
islation enacted may result in put
ting an end to the blacklisting policy
of Great Britain, the discrimination
against American commerce, inter
ference with American mails and em
bargoes on American products.

! 3 PRIZE MULE COLTS
TO BE SOLD MONDAY
Animals Are Now Property
of Columbia Retail Mer
chants Association.
SHOW IN 1917 ALSO
T. Murrav Won First and
Fourth, F. Brockman,
Takes Second.
The three best mule colts of Boone
County, the property of the Retail
Merchants' Association by reason of
the $1,000 cash premium offered on
the last day of the Boone County Fair
this year at the mule colt exhibit,
will be sold here at public auction at
1:30 o'clock, Monday, September 18.
On account of the great amount of
interest that was shown this year at
the fair in the mule colt show, a com
mittee from the association met yes
terday to make arrangements for an
other such event at the Boone County
Fair next year. H. R. Jackson, chair
man of the committee, said this morn
ing that the plans for the exhibit had
been decided upon but deferred the
announcement of what arrangements
had been made. The members of the
association expect to make the mule
colt show at the fair next year more
interesting than ever.
The three colts which will be sold
on the monthly auction day here
were the first, second and fourth
prize winners at the show. They
were owned by and brought the fol
lowing cash prizes:
Tilford Murry, of Columbia, first.
$300; F. Brockman, of Clifton Hills,
second, $250; Tilford Murry, fourth.
The third colt which would have
brought $200 was kept by the owner,
A. F. Ballew, of Centralia, who pre
ferred to take only $40 and keep his
colt, since he'is a mail-carrier. That
gives some idea of the class of colts
which won the high show stakes. At
the show the owner of the entries had
the option of accepting the cash prizes
and giving the mule colt to, the as
sociation, or of keeping his mule colt
and taking cash premium.
At present the choice colts which
will be sold are at the farms of the
former owners. They are to be de
livered at the livery barn of E. G. Da
vis before the day of the auction sale.
The auctioneer has not been selected
yet.
The mule colt show, which now is
almost certain of becoming a regular
feature of the Boone County Fair, was
planned and carried out by the as
sociation with the idea of stimulat
ing interest in Boone County in mule
raising. Also the merchants wished
to show that they are eager to assist
in boosting any industry that benefits
the farmers.
The awards for the ten best mule
colts at the show held here August
4 were:
First, Tilford Murry, of Columbia,
$300; second, F. Brockman, Clifton
Hills. $250; third, A. F. Ballew, Cen
tralia, $200 (Mr. Ballew took $40 and
kept his colt); fourth, Tilford Mur
ry, $175; fifth, M. G. Proctor, $25;
sixth, F. Brockman, $20; seventh, T.
Evans, $15;cighth, Rufus Jacobs., Co
lumbia, $10; ninth. P. T. Bruce,
Thompson, $5; tenth, F. Brockman, $5.
