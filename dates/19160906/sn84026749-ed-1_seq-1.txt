Kutz Says Better Standard
Than That Proposed Must
Await Assessment.
CLAYTON IS DISAPPOINTEQ
v "Expected Better Treatment
From Commission," Says
Citizens' Representative.
The Washington public will
have to be satisfied with the Com
missioners' proposed standard of a
"seat for everyone, or seven feet
of standing room," until after the
valuation of the street railways is
completed.
This was -the statement made by
Col. Charres W. Kutz today at the
hearings on the improved street car
service proposition before the Pub
lic Utilitiees Commission, in answer
to a complaint from William McK.
Clayton that the proposed standard
is not satisfactory to the patrons of
the companies.
Mr. Clayton was the representa
tive of the Federation of Citizens'
Associations.
WHY CLAYTON OBJECTS.
Mr. Clayton' objection wu offered on
the ground that the proposed standard
would not preTent crowding.
"I believe." he said, "that the railway
companies do not take Into considera
tion the main 'object of transportation
the" comforts and convenience of their
patrons." - "
Asked by Commissioner Brownlow
Whom he represented, Mr. Clayton said
he "spoke for himself and the groat ma
jority of the traveling; public." f
Objection to the proposed regulations
wu offered by representatives of the
street railway companies on the ground
of additional burdens and hardships.
Questioning the tight of the commis
sion to adopt such a standard, Clarence
P. King, president of the Washington
Railway and Electric Company, said
that the question was one which In
volved rates and In any event should
be deferred until the completion of the
valuations.
The healing, he said, was not based
on complaints of the street railway In
si vice In Washington, "which la equal.
If not better, than In any large city in
the United States."
King Urge Postponement.
Due to the desire of the average cltt
aen to take the first car that comes
along, the regulations, he said, wcro
Impracticable of enforcement. Quoting
from a Georgian commission he saTC,
"The average person prefers to ride
Jn a loaded car rather than by his or
her lonesome."
Similar statements regarding the dif
ficulty of compliance with the proposed
standard were made by J. H. Hanna.
vice- president of the Capital Traction
Company.
Suggests Trial Period.
Mr. Hanna urged that If tho regu
lation be adopted they be mado
effective for a period of only six
month. This, he said, would give
opportunity for observation and per
mit the commission to learn by prac
tical experience what they would
accomplish.
J. H. Cookman and O. A. Wllburt, rep
resenting the employes of the Caplul
Traction Company and Washlntcton
Railway and Electric Company, also
urged that the regulations. If adopteJ.
be enforced for a trial period, declar
ing they had an Important bearing on
the working conditions of the men.
The trial period was approved also by
Evan H, Tucker, president of the
Northeast Washington Citizens' As
sociation. Herman E. Gasch asked that regula
tions be adopted for the Improvement
of the service.
Today's hearing followed a number
of conferences between the commis
sion and the railways regarding the
proposed standard.

Friend.
JEALOUSY MAY BE MOTIVE
Bohemian Life of New York
Lawyer Offers Wide Field
for Police Investigation.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6. Groping
for a clue to the identity of two
masked men who shot and killed
Attorney Dwight P. Dilworth as he
sat in an automobile with a young
woman companion in Van Cortland
Park Sunday night, the police had
detained and were questioning
three men today. But with the trail
that might establish a motive for
the shooting branching out from
possible blackmail to suggestions
of revenge due to Dilworth's night
life in the white light district,
authorities had faint hope of suc
cess. Bernard Decio, twenty-one, was
arrested early today near the scene
of the murder. He was wanted
for the robbery of Charles Colby
in the park on the night of August
26.
At the same time police .believe
he may know something of the Dil
worth shooting. Tony Gadina was
arrested in Mt. Vernon following"
a hold-up there and Georgei Ley
den, who was with Gadiria at the
time of his arrest, is also held.
WELL KNOWN ON BROADWAY.
Stories began to come to light today
of Dilworth's Ufa a Droadway. The
police wera told he hud a wide ac
quaintance In thfttrcal circles. They
were also told Dilworth's fondness for
women resulted In his forced with
drawal from a firm here. Whether some
enemy made In his Bohemian life was
responsible for his death Is a new angle
being Investigated by the police, while
the clue that he was a victim of black
mailers is still being run down.
Reports from the West that threats
were made against Dilworth's life fol
lowing the murder of his father In the
strange string of violent deaths In his
family ha furnished another angle for
Investigation. Dilworth pressed the
prosecution of his father's slayer and
hewaa sentenced to life Imprisonment.

Congressman Fitzgerald, chairman

Mr. Fitzgerald said he was opposed to
a permanent annual appropriation for

Instead of proposing that Congress
shall appropriate from year to year for
the needs of the tariff commission, as
proposed In the House bill, tho Senate
provides that there shall be a perma
nent annual appropriation of 1300,000
for the commission.
"1 have been trying for fifteen years
to get rid of'these continuing appropria

today after giving out througli a friend
the story of his exploit.

appeared to catch lire In her forward

"I was so pleased that In my excite

my signal to stop firing and came

The Iron Cross worn by one of the
men of the Zeppelin crew and a re
volver picked up In the Zeppelin wreck
age were given to Robinson as spoils of
war.
Tho bodies of eighteen Zeppelin sail

was brought down Sunday morning,
were burled three miles from Cuffley
today, but not with military observan

The Church of England burial service
was used. Objection had como from
many quarters to the suggestion that
the Zeppelin crew be burled with mili

been their victims.
Police In Attendance.
The vans of Jhe Royal Flying Corps

If Provisions of Revenue Bill
Become Law President Will
Have Wide Powers.
PROTESTS ARE EXPECTED
State Department Is Watching
Situation Allies Say Ger
many Is to Blame.
The possibility of serious com
mercial and diplomatic complica
tions growing out of the action of
Congress in empowering the Presi
dent to retaliate against countries
that discriminate against American
interests in the matter of shipping,
or exclude American products, or
interfere with American mails, is
not being underestimated here to
day. The most common explanation is
that the Administration assented to
the inclusion of these provisions
because they place the discretion
in the hands of the President, to
Lexercise. thesepowers if ,he sees
fit. Had it not been thus" framed,
Congress might have made matters
much more difficult to handle by
passing legislation directly requir
ing these retaliations.
TOBACCO MEN COMPLAIN.
The tobacco Interests have been In
censed ngalnst the allied power be
cause of regulations requiting that to
bacco consigned to Holland must go
to the Dutch Overseas trust. This was
Intended as a means to keep It from
being sent Into Germany through Hol
land. It was well known that much to
bacco hnd reached Germany In this
way.
Thus Congress took steps to retaliate
against the blockading allies; but as a
matter of fact Germany, It now appears,
Is a much more serious offender against
American tobacco, for It has positively
forbidden nil Imports of tobacco save
that from Turkey.
This. It Is pointed out, Is a square dis
crimination against the United States
and In favor of Turkey; the allies reg
ulations were equally applied, and not
r discrimination, though it is admitted
that they aimed to keep tobacco out of
Germany; which Is claimed as a light
under tho International law of block
ade. Diplomats May Protest.
Rut there Is likely to be some vigorous
protest from tho allied diplomats on
the ground that the Vnlted States for
eign office Is reported to have known
about tho German exclusion of our to
bacco, and yet kept thn Information to
Itself and allowed Congress to adopt
legislation aimed against the allies In
stead of ngalnst Germany.
Germany, thc nllled diplomats will
maintain, was by far the greater of
fender against America; yet the pro
posed retaliation is against the allies
and not ngalnst Germany.
As to the charges that British ships
have refused American cargoes, it is
Colntcd out that this has In some cases

By WILBUR S. FORREST,
LONDON, Sept. 6. A bold Ger
man stroke, aiming at thc early
capture of Bucharest, capital of
Roumania, by the "back door"
route, was revealed in dispatches
from Berlin today.
The Germans and Bulgars have
concentrated artillery and men
against the strongly fortified Rou
manian bridgehead at Tutrakan, on
the Danube, only forty miles south
east of Bucharest.
The German war office this after
noon announced the capture of
seven Roumanian works near Tut
rakan, following the occupation of
advanced positions announced yes
terday. Tutrakan lies at the end of a
railway leading along a river valley
directly to Bucharest. The Ger
mans,' it is believed here, hope to
cross the Danube, strike down this
valley, and inflict a severe blow on
the morale of the Roumanian
people by seizing their capital
while the main Roumanian army
is invading Transylvania.
BUCHAREST SHOWS NO FEAR.
Bucharest dispatches, however, as
sert that the Southern frontier
Is well-protected and that Buch
arest Is In no danger from that
direction. The Roumanian war office
today announced the repulse of the
German-Bulgarian invaders everywhere
on the Dobrudja frontier and reported
the capture of another Transylvania,
town.
On the Somme battle front, the al
lies won further victories in last night's
fighting. The British captured th
whole of Leuse wood, pushing their ad
vance to within a mile of Combles,
while French troops are already at th
outskirts of that strongly-fortified
town. South of the Somme the French
repulsed repeated German attacks. The
German war office this afternoon ad
mitted for tho first time the loss of
Clery to General Foch's troops.
The Russian war office announced
further progress near the Hungarian
frontier and the loss of ground In th.lt
region was admitted at Berlin: The
