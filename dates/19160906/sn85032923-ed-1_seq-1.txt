Missing Fingers
Cause Rejection
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 4. Rejected fot
enlistment in the United States Ma
rine Corps because the "trigger" and
middle fingers were missing from his
right hand, Elbert Harlan, a raw-boned
applicant from Oklahoma, went
from the recruiting station in the Ful
lcrton building, to a shooting gallery
nearby, and made 25 straight hits on
a moving target with a small calibre
rifle, while the sergeant who had re
jected him looked on.
"I can shoot better with my little
finger than some men can with their
trigger fingers," Harlan said after his
performance at the gallery, "and I
cannot understand why you won't
take mc."
The marine sergeant explained that
a hand minus several fingers would
look bad when encased in white
gloves and that the loss of the fingers
would seriously interfere with proper
landling of the rifle at drills.
But the Oklahoma recruit was un
convinced and went back home in the
belief that the government doesn't
know a good man when it sees one.

GREEK PREMIER
PREPARES FOR
GERMAN AGENTS CHASED
THROUGH STREETS OF
ATHENS BY SAILORS
AND POLICE.
ATHENS, Sept. 3. Seizing the op
portunity offered by the presence at
Piraeus, within gunshot of Athens, of
a large fleet of the Entente nations,
Premier Zaimis has assumed unobtru
sively, what amounts virtually to dir
tatorial powers.
All is now in readiness for the final
act to end the neutrality of Greece.
While the people of Athens were
being mildly amused at the spectacle
of Allied sailors and secret police pur
suing German agents about the streets
a profound change in the status of af
fairs was effected quietly.
Premier Zaimis is now in a position
to swing the whole country as he will,
unobstructed by any dissenting popu
lar opinion or hostile parliamentary
control.
The first step, which placed full
powers in the hands of the premier.
was taken when lie torbailc public
gatherings last Wednesday. The ar
rangement of Friday whereby the is
suance of the decree dissolving the
row adjourned parliament and calling
new elections was postponed indefin
itely, disposed effectually of any par
liamentary interference with the gov
ernment. Trouble In Store
