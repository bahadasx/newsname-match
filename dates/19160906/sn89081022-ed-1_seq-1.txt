side of the main1 exposition hall is at
a premium. Secretary Johnsooi is
daily receiving inquiries for space.
Several stockmen who have never be
fore exhibited expect to bring in their
choice animals. The farm dubs are
stirring for their exhibits. The work
of arranging the inside of the exposi
tion hall has begun. The framework
for the new cattle barn is raised and
this structure will be in readiness for
the fair. The dairymen will appre
ciate the change of a barn for their
cows instead of the customary tent.
The single admission this year will
ba 50 cents, and 35 cents after sup
per, 25c and 15c for children. Sea
son tickets admitting some member
of the family each day and evening
will be $1.50. It will be an advan
tage to have season tickets both as a
convenience as well as a saving of
money.
The management has sent an invi
tation to state officers and candidates
for state offices to make addresses at
the fair. Gov. Bumquist will not at
tend any county fair tills year, plead
ing press of business at the office,
and the example apparently is being
followed by other state officials. Hon.
D. W. Lawler, candidate for U. S.
Senator and one of the most powerful
speakers in the state, has accepted
and will visit the fair on Sept. 22.
Others are expected to cons.
