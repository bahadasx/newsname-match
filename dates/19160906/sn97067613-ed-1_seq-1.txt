C. F. Smith, County Chairman. '
His Friends Will Support Him
Geo. I. A. Smith of Morristown Cor
ners having allowed his name to be used,
his friends will give him hearty support
for Town Representative at the Primary
next Tuesday. This makes two Republi
can aspirants for the honor. When
asked concerning bis condidacy Mr.
Smith said: "I am not seeking the office,
neither will I put forth any effort to se
cure it; however if my friends see fit to
vote for me I shall feel very grateful to
them for their support and if elected
shall serve my town faithfully and to the
best of my ability." Mr. Smith has for
many years been a prosperous farmer, a
man of good judgment, careful and con
servative in his own business and is in
every way well qualified to represent the
agricultural business and educational
interests of the town. He has for several
years been a member of the school board
and is a stauncn Kepublican. We say
the above with no disparagement to Mr.
Smalley. May the best man win!
, . "
TO "Tlie Public "
Being for many years a neighbor of
Geo. I. A. Smith, I think I can appre
ciate fully bis fitness to represent Mor
ristown in the next legislature. He will
receive a strong endorsement from this
part of the town and I believe from the
farmers generally. The friends of Mr.
Smith will need to write his name on the
primary ballot and in so doing should
not forget to make their cross.

Illegal Deer Killing Charged
Wilkie Hutchinson and Charles God
frey of the west part of Morristown were
given a hearing in Morrisville yesterday,
before Justice O. M. Watts of Stowe, on
the charge of killing deer illegally. They
were bound over to appear at the De
cember term of County Court. The deer
was found dead by Game Warden Neal
Ohapin of Stowe and taken to that place.
Alfalfa Demonstration
An alfalfa demonstration.conducted by
the agricultural classes of P. A, on the
field in the rear of the Academy, is well
worth inspection of anyone intesested in
farming conditions. Although the dem
onstration plot is small, the necessity of
using lime is conclusively shown. The
area is divided Into four sections as fol
lows:
No. 1 Seed only
No. 2 Seed and Inoculation
No. 3 Seed and inoculation and lime
Ho. 4 Seed and lime
The inoculation used was obtained free
of charge from the U. S. Government at
Washington. Any one may obtain it by
simply putting in a request. Alfalfa
ranks highest of all roughages as a dairy
feed, is the heaviest yielder and is best for
the soil.
Worthless Dog-Dead Sheep
The Selectmen were called to the farm
of Jimtnie Rock in the west part of town
Sunday afternoon to investigate the
work of an unknown dog among Mr.
Rock's flock of 46 sheep. They found
three killed and eight badly bitten, with
the possibility that four more may die.
A yellow dog was seen at a distance in
the vicinity but beyond this nothing has
been learned by the authorities as to its
idenity. This is the first case reported
this year bt there were several flocks
attacked last season and some damage
done in the same vicinity.
Twin Girls
Twin girls were born this morning to
