EIGHT HOUR P'u QUESTION.
NOT ISSUE, NOW SOUTHER??
RAILROADS SAY.
Statement Asserts That Workers' De?
mend Is Only for Increased Com*
pensatlon.
Washington. Sept. 1.?Advancing
the contention that the eight hour day
is not the Issue In tho present contro?
versy, 12 railroad officials represent?
ing practically all Southern roads Is?
sued a statement today explaining
their posltien. It is addressed "To
the people of the South."
"It has been suggested that an eight
hour day is not the proper subject of
arbitration," says the statement. "To
thisj they (the railroads) have replied
that an eight hour day is not an Issue,
but even If it were there is no evi?
dence sufficient) to place the question
beyond the limits of honest difference
af opinion, that tho eight hour day for
men engaged In train Bervic* has been
tnally accepted by social opinion.
"To justify this view they point to
the fact that the men themselves have
not demanded it, do not want It and
would not accept it if offered; that the
underlying principle of an eight hour
day, where it has been introduced, is
humanitarian for the purpose of ac?
tually shortening the hours of labor
ind has never been Justified by any
?aw or by any social movement as a
means of increasing wages for hours
that shall remain unchanged; that
I the establishment of an eight hour
day In train service has never been
favored in any political platform of
any party and while the subject of an
eight hour day has been under con?
sideration In party conventions, its ap?
plication has been carefully limited
by party opinion and has excluded
employes In railroad service and gen?
erally In industrial pursuits; that It
has never been recommended by an
executive officer of this country for
adoption by any legislative body and
by; any ?t?te, and that It has never
been brought Into prominent pubLc
discussion except in the misleading as?
pect given to it in this wage contro?
versy and Is now being thought of
only as a means of avoiding the na?
tionwide disaster of interrupted trans?
portation facilities."
After pointing out the fact that the
men had refused arbitration of all
points at issue, the reason given being
thatj 'no fair arbitration of such mat?
tere of difference U possible," the
statement says:
"In saying that no arbitration can
be fair, they indict the whole nation
for the proposition was that the pres?
ident should appoint the arbitrators.
They claim the right to arbitrarily put
upon the railroads, upon the other
employes and upon the whole public,
their own demands by the strong arm
of their irresponsible and unregulated
power .
"The country Is, therefore, con?
fronted by the question whether It la
to be ruled by law or by the few men
who acknowledge no limitation, ex?
cept the limitation of force, upon their
obligations to the social welfare."

ft. B. STRIKE ORDER REVOKED.
ADAMSON BILL AVERTING GREAT
TIEUP OF TRAFFIC PASSED
RY SENATE.
Despite Desperate Opposition and Ef?
forts to Amend Measure is Sent to
President for His Signature by
Strictly Party Vote?Senators De?
el uro Congress Was Coerced Into
Action?To Take Effect January 1.
Washington, Sept. 2.?The threat
of a general railroad strike, which has
been hanging like a pall over the
country for nearly a month was lifted
tonight.
Three hours after the senate had
passed without amendment the Ada,m
son eight hour day bill, passed by the !
house yesterday, the heads of the four
great railroad employees' brother?
hoods telegraphed 600-odd code mes?
sages to their general chairmen in all
parts of the country cancelling the j
strike order issued a week ago to
take effect next Monday morning at
7 o'clock. i
The legislative expedient to avert
the strike was passed in the senate
by a vote of 43 to 28?almost a strict
party vote?amid stirring scenes, af?
ter many senators, Democrats and
Republicans, had fought desperately
to amend the measure by provisions
designed to prevent industrial disas?
ters in the future. Some senators,
thoroughly aroused, declared congress
was being coerced Into enactment of
legislation that It did not desire, and
that it knew would return to plague
It In tho future.
In both houses the measure was
signed within a few minutes after a
final vote In the senate
O flic la Is of the brotherhoods, who
witnessed the final passage of the bill
had announced early in the night that
cancellation of the strike would, not
be ordered until the bill, had ibeen
signed by the president and actually
had become ftut later the*(ion
through their chairmen the message
that a satisfactory settlement had
been secured.
The bill that stopped the strike pro?
vides that after January 1, 1917, eight
hours shall be regarded us a basis of
reckoning for a day's pay for men
engaged In the operation of railroad
train in interstate commerce, (except?
ing roads less than 100 miles long
and electric liner,) that they shall re?
ceive pro rata pay for work in ex?
cess of eight hours and that their
rate of compensation shall not be
changed pending an investigation for
from six/ to nine months of the effect
of the eight-hour day upon the rail?
roads by a commission to be appoint?
ed by the president.
Efforts to amend the bill in the
senate were futile, the supreme effort
\ to alter It having been led by Senator
Underwood, who sought to provide
that the Interstate commerce commis?
sion should have power to flx rail?
road wages and hours of service in
J the future. This amendment was de?
feated by a vote of 57 to 14.
Only two Democrats, Senators Hard
. wick, of Georgia, and Clarke, of Ar?
kansas, voted against Ihe bill, and one
Republican, LaFollette, of Wisconsin,
voted for it.
In the debate on the Adamson bill
Senator Borah said he doubted if the
price about to be paid would "cure tho
patient." He had his own views, he
said, of the ability of the four broth?
erhood's chiefs to call off the strike,
but ho was certain the great body of
trainmen never would carry the strike
'order out if they were assured.that
the president and congress were se?
riously investigating with a view to
J legislation. No severer indictment
could be drawn against their charac?
ter and intelligence, he said, than to
suy they would not accept such assur?
ance.
"If congress cannot proceed to con?
sider this deliberately and with all
facts at hand," he asked, "then it Is
truly yielding to dictation. If that
Is the situation, then congress has
reached the greatest crisis of Its
whole history . . . . and the halo that
has hovered over t lie body for years
will soon bo dissolved.
"I warn union labor that the amend
j ment to give the Interstate commerce
commission authority to fix wages is
the Inevitable logic of the position we
will OCOUPS when we pass this bill.
When they accept this bill the union
men will have conceded tho right of
I
Congress or other governmental tri?
bune to fix wages.
"I cannot get the consent of my
conscience and my judgment to vote
for this bill," said Senator Jones,
j "This net is a compulsory and arbi?
trary settlement.'
I Senaten- l'ornercne said he would
lanpport the bill because he felt the

The Southern Railway has raised its
embargo insofar as it applies to ship?
ments to destinations on its own lines.
Perishable freight, including livestock
I and explosives, will not bo accepted
for other lines, unless the shipper has
made arangements for its delivery' m
advance. Mobile and Ohio announced
today that Its embargo would be 11ft

similar action.

URGES USE OF TEN CENT LOAF.
1 ?resident of Master Bakers Says Five
cent Loaf is Not Economical.
1 Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 2.<?S. F. Mc
I Donald, president of the National As?
sociation of Master Bakers in a state?
ment Issued here today urged the
adoption by housewives of tho coun?
try of the ten-cent loaf of bread, in?
stead of the popular five-cent loaf, as
a matter of economy.
He called attention to a resolution
I pussed at the recent bakers' conven
' tlon held In Salt Lake City to aban?
don the making of the five-cent loaf,
! and make the ten-cent loaf the unit
? of bankers' bread,
i *
Mr. McDonald said this resolution
' had been widely misconstrued into
meaning that the bakers intended to
charge ten cents for the five-cent loaf.
Tho five-cent loaf, he said, was im?
possible because of the high cost of
flour and the labor connected with its
production.
He asserted that the high standard
of quality maintained by the bakers
, in the United States can not continue
I unless the larger unit is adopted.

Senator Lewis submitted a resolu

the Senate that ar.y other future dis?
putes between railroad employers and
employes pending the proposed inves?
tigation should be submitted to the
j interstate commerce commission for
' investigation, the commission to make
a public report of what it concludes
to bo just and reasonable. The reso?
lution was offered as a separate meas
; ure to be taken up uftor disposition
j of amendements to the bill.
Debate on amendments began at
! 4 o'clock, Senator Underwood's pro
! posal to give tho Interstate commerce
commission authority to tlx railway
wages and hours being taken up lirst.
' Senator Underwood said the bill with?
out his amendment was a price of
peace without any attempt perma?
nently to solve tin great questions in?
volved. Senator Newlands also urged
adoption of the amen lment.
Senator Reed told the Senate that
Chairman Adamson of the House com?
merce committee, had informed him it
would be impossible to pass the bill
before Monday with the Underwood
amendment included, because there is
no quorum of the House in Washing*
ton. Senator Reed opposed the

Removing All Dou^t of Legality of
Act?'How Long l*cace Shall Reign \
lttPlilnlt on Developments.
Washington, Sept. 3.?The Adam
son eight-hour day bill, exacted from
congress last week by the railroad
brotherhoods as the price of calling
off the nation-wide strike ordered fori
tomorrow, was signed by President
Wilson today in his private car at!
the union station, where he stopped j
on his way from Shadow Lawn, N. I
J., to Hodgenville, Ky. That there ,
may be no question as to the legality j
of the measure as a result of it hav- ]
ing been signed on Sunday, the pres?
ident will affix his signature again
upon his return to Washington next
Tuesday.
How long peace shall reign as a
result of the bill apparently is de?
pendent upon developments In the
proposed move to test the constif 1
tionality of the act. Should the rail?
roads take no action but await the
beginning of an Investigation of the
workings of the eight hour day oy
the special commission for which the
measure provides, the brotherhoods
will remain inactive. The employes'
leaders declare, however, that should
the law be held unconstitutional and
the railroads attempt to restore the
ten hour day on their lines, a strike
will follow promptly.
Brotherhood heads in a ciicular
leter to their members today made
no comment on the measure as pass
| ed. They merely pointed out that it
I would not become effective until next
January 1 and that many things
might occur between now and then
which would change materially any
suggestions or comment they might
make.
Nei*n*Wthe ' ^
witnessed the signing of the bill. They
had expected, according to tentative
arrangements made by Secretary Wil?
son lust night, to be present, but the
president decided to attend to the
( business at the railroad station and
newspaper correspondents gave them
their first information about it. The
four pens used by the president in
signing the bill?one for each sylla?
ble of his name?will be presented
to the four brotherhood heads, A. B.
Garretson, W. G. Lee, W. S. Carter
and W. S. Stone, after being used for
resigning the bill Tuesday.
No ceremony attended the signing
today. It originally had been planned
that the president should go to the
White House, but this was changed
and instead Rudolph Forster, assist?
ant secretary to the president, took
the bill to the train. Near the car
window a group of trainmen in their
overalls paused in their work long
enough to watch the president write
his name. An engineer, passing on a
yard engine, celebrated the occasion
with several prolonged blasts of his
whistle.
i While at the station the president
also signed several commissions and
executive papers and sent Secretary
Tumulty to the home of Majority
Leader Kern of the senate to urge
that the senate pass the Webb bill,
passed yesterday by the house, de?
signed to permit American firms to
utilize common selling agencies
abroad without violating the Sher?
man anti-trust law.
Later the President and Mrs. Wil?
son took an automobile ride about the
city. During their absence the pri?
vate car was attached to a special
train carrying guests of the Lin?
coln Farm association. bound :or
Hodgenville to participate in the exer?
cises incident to the transfer of tho
log cabin in which Abraham Lincoln
was born to the federal government
grounds tomorrow, at which time the
president will make an address.
It developed today that the brother?
hoods before being summoned to
Washington by Pr?sident Wilson three
weeks ago had agreed to call a strike
effective August 20. Tho orders they
drafted were used when the strike
finally was set for Labor day. After
having been printed in preparation
for the proposed strike on August 20
they were locked In a vault in Now j
York. Decision a week ago last Sit-,
urday to order a strike the next lay,
when the majority of the committee of j
j 040 were leaving for their homes, was ,
I followed by a hasty trip to New York
by t\so representatives of the brother*
I hoods. The strike date, September 4,
was tilled in With a rubber stamp, but
the original date of the call, August
11. was not changed.
Hundreds of telegrams came to .he
