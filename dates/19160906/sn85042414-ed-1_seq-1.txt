PARTY EXPECTED TO
HAVE MOST RADICAL
PLATFORM IN HISTORY
OE STATE POLITICS
League Faction Decides up
on William Lemke as
Chairman.
WANT ORGANIZATION
TO MODERATE PLANS
Some Members of Opposi
tion Ready to Concede
Few Things.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Bismarck. N. D.. Sept. 6.—At the
opening of the meeting of the Repub
lican state committee at the capltol
this afternoon the prospects are that
the Republican party of North Dakota
•will enter upon the active work of
the campaign, standing on the most
radical platform ever adopted by any
political party in the state, and offi
cered by men chosen exclusively from
the radical element.
During the past twenty-four hours
there has been much checking of
names, and claims have been advanc
ed both by the conservatives and the
Non-Partisan League element that
each faction would be able to control,
but it now appears certain that the
league faction will be able to put its
entire program through.
At caucus held this forenoon the
league faction decided on William
Lemke of Fargo for chairman, Ray
McKaig of Morton county for secre
tary, and H. L. Halvorson of Eddy
county for treasurer. There has been
talk in the other camp of Treadwell
Twichell of Fargo for chairman, but
this has subsided, and the conserva
tives are now prepared to offer August
Johnson of Washburn as a compro
mise candidate, but with little prob
ability that the offer will be accepted.
It is expected that the league slate as
given above will stand.
League Program.
The platform which the league
Je^deca. ba.'ve toeen .,ebaplngr «up -cora
ni its the party to terminal elevators,
state hall insurance, exemption of
farm improvements from taxation, ru
ral credits, civil service, the budget
system and endorsement of the Re
publican national ticket. Several
members of the opposition are prepar
ed to concede terminal elevators with
in the state and compulsory hail in
surance, and efforts are still in prog
ress to induce the league people to
moderate some of their demands.
The Democrats, after many sessions
and much discussion, have decided
tentatively on F. W. McLean for state
chairman. E. H. Stenvik of Minot
has been active candidate, and J. Nel
son Kelly of Grand Forks was under
consideration as a compromise can
didate. Mr. Kelly did not desire the
position, and McLean is practically as
sured of election. No decision has
been made at this time as to secretary
of the Democratic committee.
The question may arise as to the
eligibility of both Lemke and McLean.
Neither of these is a member of his
party committee, and some members
maintain that the chairman must be a
member of the committee.
There is not likely to be much con
test over the Democratic platform, as
the controversies in the Democratic
party in North Dakota are chiefly of
a personal nature.
If the Republican conservatives feel
reasonably sure when they come to an
actual test of strength in the meeting
that they have a fighting chance, a
substitute platform will be presented,
but It may be decided that this' is not
worth while. There is certain, how
ever, to be a lively fight over the So
cialistic program which the league
element will propose.
Wo Estimate Possible.
Bismarck, N. D., (Tuesday night).
About half of the 49 members of
the Republican State Committee have
reached Bismarck for tomorrow's
meeting. All the Interest centers
around that meeting, because of the
contest between the faction allied
with the Nonpartisan League and the
element representing the old standard
membership of the party. At this
time, it is impossible to make any es
timate of the outcome of the meeting
either as to the officers to be select
ed or as to the type of platform to be
Adopted. More members will'be in
attendance by tomorrow morning, but'
at this time everything is in doubt.
There is some question as to the
distance wh.lcb: the representatives of
the nonpartisan league will care to go
even if they have the power in the
framing of a platform.- There is at
this time a very general feeling that
because of the members of the league
themselves are not united on the spe
cific qualities which ought to- be
adopted, no serious attempt will be
made to incorporate In a party plat
form the more extreme proposals
which have been advocated from time
to time by speakers and writers of
the league. Aocordlng to this view,
the league element lit In control of the
committee will content Itself with a
few general statements which may be
Interpreted by the rank and file as
endorsements of what has generally
been understood to be the platform
of the league.
Committee members not In sympa
thy with the league will make a
strenuous effort for the adoption ,of
a conservative platform, one whie*
will be in line with the national plat,
form and which will permit the party
In North Dakota to a policy of wis
dom and economy and one on which
the party can stand without being
obliged to, make any apologies for Its
position. Some of the representatives
of this element who have checked the
list of committeemen over feel sure
-'thai they' will have a malority of the
'committee In favor of this line of ac
tion unless men whom they. Jtnow to

MEDIATORS IN
FIRST SESSION
AT NEW LONDON
Details of Conference Are
Being Arranged
Today.
Arranging the details of the coming
conferences was the chief matter on
the program, although Secretary
Franklin K. Lane, chairman of the
American commission, indicated that
there might be some discussion of
subjects to be reviewed later In the
day.
When the commissioners assem
bled, It had not been determined just
who might attend the conferences in
addition to members. James Linn
Rodgers, special agent of the state
department in Mexico City, who was
summoned north for the meetings,
may participate, since his knowledge
of the situation may be of use, not
only to the American, but also the
Mexican commissioners..
DANISH WEST INDIES.
Washington. Sept. 6.—A report
from the foreign relations committee
recommending ratification of the
treaty with Denmark for purchase of
the Danish West Indies for $25,000,
OOOwas submitted to the senate late
yesterday in executive session. Sen
ator Stone, chairman of the commit
tee. announced he would call the
treaty up today and move Its ratifica
tion.
Probability of the treaty being rati
fied at this session of congress, how
ever, is regarded as remote. Senator
istone said no effort would be made
to delay adjournment If any opposi
tion developed. Senator Borah, for
one, is opposed to the purchase, and
any opposition to immediate ratifica
tion will serve to send the treaty over
until the next session.
FUTILE FORTS.
Washington, Sept. 6.—American
Minister Voplcka, accredited to Ru
mania, Serbia and Bulgaria, advised
the state department yesterday that
American Red Cross efforts for relief
of starving Serbians would be futile
at this time. Officials here believe the
entrance of Rumania into the war is
the primary cause. The Red Cross
had planned to secure foodstuffs for
the famine victims in §erbia from
Rumania.
