bitterly excoriating the republican
senators who voted au'uinst the
emergency revenue iiicasurc was
Uuen out today from western demo

"It should also re realized." the

International News Service;
WASHINGTON, Sept Under
instructions from the state depart
ment Ambassador Guthrie at Tokio
and Minister Kcinaeh at IVkin, are
investigating the Japanese-Chinese
situation precipitated by the de
majds made upon China by Japan
in connection witn the anti-Japanese
outbreaks in Mongolia.
Japan has admitted that she has
demanded indemnities, an apology
for the attacks mailt' uion Japan,
and political concessions through
out inner Mongolia and southern
Manchuria, but, in so notifying the
United States she has insisted that
there is no plan of interference with
the "open door" policy. It is in
formation as to whether the state
ments of Japan are founded on fact
that the American representatives
at the Japanese and Chinese cap
itals will seek.
The concessions demanded by
Japan, it is openly claimed here,
will make her absolutely supreme in
Mongolia and Manchuria. Ollkuals
say that on the face of the demands
Japan seeks to rob China of sov
ereignty over much of her most
al uable territory. This government
is gravely anxious over the outlook
and direct orders have been issued
by Sec'y Irnsing that ollicials shall
refrain from discussing it for pub
lication. WERTZ TO BE NAMED

"Political neutrality" was the key

had been made to run the "steam

calling for the indorsement of
either Pres't Wilson or CharUs K.

PRESIDENT WILL BE ABLE
TO BACK UP DEMANDS
Provisions Can be Put Into Ef
fect in a Manner Recog
nized by Internation
al Law.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, ept. 6. Europe's
chancellories are deeply concerned
over the drastic enactments contain
ed in the administration's shipping
bill, and in the revenue measure ap
proved by the senate early today,
placing retaliatory weapons in the
hands of Pres't Wilson. Through
their diplomatic representatives here
they are following closely this legis
lation, which will permit Pres't
Wilson to substitute for passive dip
lomacy a policy of reprisal against
all nations discriminating against
American trade. The action of this
government is revolutionary and en
tirely unexpected. It permits the
president to back up steamship
mails a.!d boycott demands in a way
that i-l prove distinctly embarrass
ing to the entente allies. t
While unoltlciai suggestions have
been made by certain of the em
bassies that these provisions violate
existing trade agreements, they have
not been received with any degree
of warmth at the state department.
It has been pointed out that the
powers given the president under the
proposed laws are in every way dis
cretionary, lie can utilize them if
the necessity arises, but they can be
put into effect in a manner recog
nized by international law.
The fact that these amendments
have been fathered by Sens. James,
Thomas and Phelan, thick and thin
supporters of the administration, is
accepted as indicating that they have
the approval of the president and
Sec'y of State Lansing. It has been
known for some time that the delay
on the part of Great Britain and
Franc in giving relief to the pro
test against the unnecessary deten
tion and rilling of American nuuls
to and from this country has been a
source of irritation to the state de
partment. Put there was nothing
that this country could do under the
circumstances.
Uut if the provisions read ii.to the
revenue bill remain unchanged, and
ottkials expect that they will, then
the administration can enforce a re
ply that will be satisfactory to it
and end the intolerable interference
with mails that are in no way subject
to the operations of warfare.

WASHINGTON. Sept. . With
the administration revenue bill in
the linal stages of enactment into
law, congress today rapidly worked
its way toward tinal adjournment. A
conference committee of seven sen
ators and seven representatives
strove steadily to reconcile the
differences be-tween the two houses
on the revenue measure, and the
leaders planned to bring the long
session to a close just as soon as
the bill in its tinal form can bo
agreed upon.
The conference committee went
to work without waiting for the
house formality to disagree to the
numerous senate amendments and
informal conferences smoothed out
many of the disputes involved in
senate changes. The conferees were
eonrident that the would reach a
'complete agreement in ample time
j to aJlovv adjournment sine die to-
morrow, and some leaders een
hoped for an agreement that would
bring the session to an end late
tonight. P.oth house and senate
marked time to await the action of
the conference committee, working
on miscellaneous routine legislation.
Thf corrupt practices act. design
ed to limit campaign expenditure
was taken up by the senate today
despite the plans of administration
leaders to sidetrack th1 measure.
Py a vote of '.".2 to 14, the senate
adopted a motion by Sen. Owen to
take up the measure. Plans fo
adjournment tomorrow were further
tangled.

fairs have figured in the news
papers. Harnes tiled suit for di
vorce after he came aome one day
to tind his wife entertaining a bar

ment. Mrs. Harnes maintained her
innocence, declaring that her par
rot had escaped. The bartender,
she said, caught it for her. where
upon she invited him in to vvah his
hands and have some refreshment.0.
She had made frequent efforts to
conciliate her husband since he
started the action, but each time
he was obdurate.
Lust night she made a final en
gagemtnt with him to plead that
he withdraw his suit for divorce.
When he refused, she shot him, ac
cording to the police.
