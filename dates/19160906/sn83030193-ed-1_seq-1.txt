AI.HANY. Sept. 6. "Booze bills"
for the trip of Gov. Whitman's party
to tho Panama Exposition at 8an
Francisco last year amounted to
1717.41.
A partially Itemized account ot this
expendlturo of public money, which
had been concealed In lump sura re

the Btnto Comptroller, but the bills
are not complete nnd do not balance
with tho returns previously made.
Tho Comptroller's experts are unable
to mako tho accounts balance, or .to

passing upon their reasonableness

brouclc In a recent decision ruled,
was tho duty of tho Comptroller.

Long Drop Over East River
Necessary to Get Head
way for Volplaning.
Frederick Trubee Davison, eldest
son of H. P. Davison of the house
of J. P. Morgan A Company, and)
Robert A. Lovett, son of Judge R. 8.'
Lovett, bond of the Union Pacific
Railroad system, did a stunt In a
Curtlss hydroaeroplane over the East
River off Hunter's Point to-day
which caused thousands of beholders
to gasp, tlrst with horror and then
with admiration.
The two young men are students
In tho aviation school recently es
tablished nt Port Washington by
Mrs. H. P. Oavlson nnd n number of
wenlthy enthusiasts for civilian re
paredness. Young Oavlson has been
flying for several months, but If h
has before accomplished spectacular
feats In tho air his Identity as the
aviator doing them has been kept
quiet.
With Mr. Lovett ns a passenger,
Mr. Davison started for a trip over
Long Islnnd Sound nnd tho East Itlver
for tho upper bay to Join In the naval
manoeuvres of the mosquito fleet.
Ho roso rapidly Immediately after
leaving Munhassot Hay and ciimn
over Hell Gate n thousand feet In tho
air, moving swiftly though rocked
perceptibly by the strong wind.
Tho airship was watched by every
body along tho river trout nnd nn
ferries and other craft. Tim conva
lescent patients In Hcllcvue Hospital
were hurrying to the railings of the
balconies to have u look when tho
rocking became more severe and tbu
aeroplane seemed to lose headway
and slide sideways.
The tiny figures of the aviators
could be seen moving about sharply.
Then tho nose of the aircraft turned
sharply downward; to the spectators
It seemed ns though the tall pointed
vertically to the sky. With a swoop
down which caused many to turn
nway their heads nnd rover tholr eyes
with the certainty of a tragedy It
darted toward tho river. Tim drum
ming hum of tho englnn had ceased
before tho plutign began, but the
speed of tho drop seemed to Increase
te.rrlllcally.
A hundred fret or more nbovo the
water tho direction changed abruptly
Into nn almost horizontal plane, Be
tween two river steamers the aero.
piano struck tho river with n splusli
which sent flying foam fifty feet In
tho air and for a moment hid It from
sight. In another frnetlon of a sec
nnd tho craft was gliding swiftly out
of tho smother along tho edgo of the
.New York Yacht Club anchorugu.
A lnunr.h from tho Viking, George
K, Ilaker'a yacht, ran out to tho h) -droaeroplnno
nnd towed It Into the
club landing. Davison and Lovett
wore soaked to tho skin, but unhurt
nnd after borrowing dried clothing
began mnklng repairs to the engine.
Young Duvlson said his engines
had gone out of commission without
warning nnd In order to get headway
to volplane, thn long drop of nearly
1,000 feet was necessary: so !mg as
he kept control of his deprexfrtng and
elevating planes, bo said, the feat was
not dangerous, no matter how thrill
Ing It might havn looked,

under arrest. These men are held on
entirely different charges, but were
supposed to have knowledge of the
murder of Lawyer Dllworth.
Thoy were put In line with eight
other men, called In from the street or
selected from among prisoners await
ing a hearing.
Miss McNIfT walked up and down
tho line, scrutinizing all eleven for
several minutes, asking that one or
two of them put on peaked caps, like
those she saw on tho men who killed
Dllworth.
In the end she said she could not
pick out any one as ono sho had eer

Street, us the most Importnnt, of tho
threo suspects ns ho is charged with
having held up Charles Colby of No.

Colby wus going through the park
In his automobile, and when nuur tho
hcoiio of thn Dllworth murder two
men sprang from the bushes ami or
dcred him to stop. He. huh relieved
of Jowely and money to tho valuo
of $276.
Tho police ay Deslo had hern seen
around tho park for several days
prior to the Incident, and Is alleged
to have told a group of boys that he
"was going to hold up somebody."
He has served twenty days In the
workhouse for disorderly conduct, and
was once arrested for burglary, but
discharged, It Is said by the police.
The second suspect Is Tony Gad
tna, of Mt. Vernon, who said he woa
a laborer. Gadlna was captured
after tho Mt. Vernon pollco hud sent
out an alarm for him, following a
bold hold up there Saturday night.
The homo of Abraham Pitch on

MnlUiew J. Illfrrias, an onraalier tor the Aatalraauted Ualoa of
Carmen, In nn address to S.W emplojee of the InUrbnrougb, who were
discharged to-day, said late this afternooa at Lyceui Hall, Klraty-slxth
Street and Third Arenuet
"A strike Is Inevitable. Krerr union maa oa the llaes coatrolled by
Hie Interborough will be railed ont to protect you Me a."
There Is every Indication that the employees ot the surface llaes
controlled by the Interhorutigh through the Sew York City Railways
Company will be called out at the same hoar as the aabway aad "17
men. '1 lie employees of the Third Avenue surface llaes are also ex.
peeled to Join the strike as soon as a vote can be taken, and a surface
tie-up la Queens and lllchmond Is planned.
The Interborough has employed thousaads ot strike breakers aad
will endeavor to keep the underground and "l" lines open. Tke men
figure that by tying up the surface llaes they can overwhelm tke
crippled ML" and subway service.
The Interborough Company, determined on forcing a strike of the
subway and "1." employees, adopted the policy of discharging union men
to-day and dropped hundreds from the payrolls. Among the discharged
were employees who had signed the "master nnd servant' contract. These
men were discharged because they refused to take off their union buttons.
Organizer Fitzgerald of the Amalgamated Carmen's Union asserted
tliis afternoon that this will be a lock-out not a strike, because the men,
who arc expected to declare a strike. soon after midnight, cannot be ex
pected to work under intolerable conditions.
"Mr. Hedloy," said Kltnorsld, alked to us about that contract yesterday
with tears In bis eyes. He talked about It as If It were something sacred.
And to-day by his direct orders men who have signed bis 'legal' eontraot
were fired where they stood."
Mayor Mltchel Is on his way back''
to Nnw York from Plattsburs-. but he
will nrrlvo too lat to tako any part
In the tumultunun procrndlnis of to
day und It Is doubtful If hs could atop
the strike, wera he here. The Inter
boroiiKh wunts a strike, and tho union
must strike or blow up.
"Thin Is a Rood tlmo," said a high
ntllclal of tho Interboroimh this after
noon, "to tliclit this thltiK out to a Mu
lsh and wo uro trolnic to do It. We
cannot have n union controlled by

DETERMINED TO CRUSH THE

"I'rlor to ll05, about one. third of
Mr. Hcdley's tlmo was tiilum up with
adjusting petty disputes and trifling
mattors growing out of union rules.
We broUo tho union In 1905 and over

and we want to treat them fairly but
wo won't have the tlmo of valuable
men llk Ml. Hedloy taken up with
union disputes when they can be
avoided by the almoin expedient of

OrgaaUs Kitsf srald and a commit
tee of union msn from ths lines of
the New York Hallways Co. called on
Mr. Medley nt the Interborough of
fices, No. 16S Broadway, this after
noon. The conference wns arranged
last month when the agreement was
signed but Kltsgerald and his asso
ciates knew before they went to No.
105 llrondway that a strike had bssn
practically declared. Nothing cams
out of tha conference bearing on ths
dlsputo between the Interborough and
tho Amalgnmatnd Union.
A strong Indication that ths union
will call out the employees of ths
New York City Hallways the "green
enr llnea" at the sams time ths sub

out was shown this afternoon In a
long statement Issued by ths union
