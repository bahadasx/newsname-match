Inove to test the (!const t lit ionality of
ihe Act. Should the railroads take no
action but await tie beginning of al
Investigation of the workings ot the
eight-hour day by the special conumis
sion for which the ineasure provides,
the brotherhoods will reimain inactive.
The employees leaders declare, how
ever, that should the law he held un
constitutional, and the railroads at
tempt to restore the ten-hour day on
their lines a strike will follow prompt
Lw.
Brotherhood heads in a circular let
ter to their members today made no
coninent on the measure as passed.
They merely pointed out that It would
not become effective until next .an
uary 1, and that many things might
oct11tt between now and tieni. whicl
would cluinge materially any sugges
tions or commnent t(y imight imake.
