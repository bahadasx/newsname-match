Death Rites
for German
AirFighters
London, Sept. 6, (3:15 p. m.) A
great crowd gathered today to witness
the funeral of 16 members of the crew
of the Zeppelin which was brought
down during Saturday night's raid on
England.
In view of protests made against
the burial of the German airmen with
military honors, a strong force of po
lice was on duty to maintain order.
Spectators arrived long before noon
and seized on the hill near the en
trance to the cemetery in the Tillage
of Pitter's Bar, as a point of vantage.
The men were buried in a common
grave and the German officer in a
smaller one.
The funeral procession was severely
simple. The crowd which saw it pass
was unmoved. At the head was a mili
tary lorry which carried a coffin con
taining the body of the Zeppelin com
mander. Another lorry bore the cof
fins of the crew. A number of British
airmen rode In the procession.
A man in an automobile threw some
thing at the British airmen, but the
crowd promptly rebuked him. Near
the cemetery a woman threw two eggs.
The body of the German officer was
borne to the grave by six officers of
the royal flying corps. The other cof
fins were carried by men of the same
corps. The service at the grave side
was an abbreviation of the ordinary
Church of England ceremony, conduct
ed by army chaplains. The sounding
of taps was the only characteristic of a
military funeral by which the cere
mony was marked.

4Sth annual. convention of the National
Arrerican Woman's Ryfjj"gf nagocia-
tion opened here today with represent
ative women from all Bection3 of the
country In attendance.
Mayor Bacharach welcomed the del
egates at the opening session in St.
Paul's church.
Reports of committees occupied
most of the morning session. One of
the most important questions before
the convention is whether to concen
trate on federal or state campaigns or
to continue to work for both.
The presidential address of Mrs. Car
rie Chapman Catt will be delivered to
morrow. "Dixie Evening" will be cele
brated at the night session and south
ern women will be the speakers.
President Wilson is expected to ad
dress the convention Friday. On Sat
urday officers will be elected and rou
tine reports read. The convention will
close Sunday afternoon.
The national American Woman Suff
rage association will not, according to
influential leaders, endorse or criti
cize as an organization any candidate
now in the field for the office of presi
dent of the United States because of
the views he holds on the question of
equal rights for women.
It was expected by these same lead
ers, which includes Mrs. Carrie Chap
man Catt, president, and Mrs. Anna
Howard Shaw, former president of the
association, that the organization will
vote down all amendments committing
the organization exclusively for thj
suifrage amendment to the federal
constitution or to work for equal sun?
rage through the state alone. The as
sociation will decide to continue its
fight for votes for women while work
ing for both the federal amendment
and states' amendments it was de
clared. The momentous question affecting
the organization came up at the after
noon session. Miss Laura Clay of
Kentucky, favored confining the asso
ciation's activities to state legislation.
Mrs. Ira Husted Harper, New York,
urged the dropping of work for Btato
referenda and concentrate on the fed
eral amendment, while Mrs. Raymond
Brown. New York, argued that the
present policy of the association to
work for woman suffrage "by appro
priate national and state legislation,"
be continued. The vote on the ques
tion is to be taken after the debate has
concluded.
The forenoon was confined to the
routine reports of officers. Mrs.
Frank M. Roeseing of Pittsburgh, vice
president and chairman of the con
gressional committee, warned dele
gates not to let the cause of equal
rights suffer from over confidence be
cause Charles K. Hughes had endorsed
the federal amendment.
She said the congressional commit
tee had not given up hope of convinc
ing President Wilson of the Justice of
the federal amendment.

Democratic Leaders Predict
Defeat of Senator Owen's
Measure.
HOUSEHEARSORATORS
Believed Senate Will Accept
Amendments on Protests
of Allied Trade Methods.
Tfashingrton, Sept (5. Prospects
for adjourning congress today went
glimmering when the house and
senate conferees began informal
discussions on the revenue bilL
The conferees found some obsta
cles which it is hoped will be
smoothed out tomorrow.
The house meanwhile put in its time
hearing political speeches. The sen
ate, having nothing else to do, took up
the Owen corrupt practices bill, but
democratic leaders said it had no
chance of pas'sing.
Representative Mann, republican
leader, declared the senate amendment
taxing print paper above certain prices
would tend to increase the price and
drive the industry to Canada. He said,
however, that an investigation would
doubtless show no justiflcaTion for
raising the price.
The only important piece of work
now standing in the way of ad
journment, which probably will occur
tomorrow, or possibly even late to
night, was the smoothing out today of
house and senate differences on the ad
ministration emergency revenue bill,
provtdlug for the raising of $ 205,000,000
annually, the creation of a tariff com
mission and other important economic
principles.
This bill, passed last night in the
senate by a vote of 42 to 16, with five
republicans voting for it, went to con
ference today as soon as the house had
gone through the formality of naming
its conferees. It is believed their re
port will accept most senate amend
ments including those adopted yester
day directed against allied interference
with American trade.
Final consideration of the measure
in the senate last night was marked by
vain fights of Senator Underwood to
eliminate the tariff commission section
and of Senator Husting to establish
publicity of Income tax returns; and
by abandonment under Senator LaFol
lette's threat to filibuster of the ad
ministration plan to include as an
amendment the Webb bill, which would
permit American exporters to organ
ize joint selling agencies for foreign
trad e.
Senator Owen Persists.
While the conference committee was
at work on the revenue bill today, Sen
ator Owen expected to make a last at
tempt to call up the corrupt practices
bill. Senator Smith of South Carolina
wanted to get action on the immigra
tion bill.
The senate expected to find time to
pass the Porto Rican citizenship meas
ure already passed by the house and
possibly several other minor bills on
the calendar.
The bill was called up at the out
set of the session of the house on a
motion by democratic Leader Kitchin
to send the bill to conference. Repub
lican Leader Mann wanted time to read
the bill and Mr. Kitchin temporarily
withdrew the motion. With Represen
tatives Rainey of Illinois and Dixon of
Indiana, democratic ranking members
of the ways and means committee, he
went over to the senate for an Infor
mal conference on the bill!
Pending developments Mr. Kitchin
withheld the concurrent resolution for
adjournment of congress.
Senate Takes Up BI1L
The senate today decided 33 to 14
to take up Senator Owen's corrupt
practices bill which would greatly cur
tail campaign expenditures and im
pose heavy penalties for violations of
its terms.
More than 400,000 Appointments.
During the administration of Presi
dents Roosevelt. Taft and Wilson. 761
executive orders were issued giving
government positions to Individuals
and more than 400,000 appointments
were made from the classified service
lists In competitive examinations.
This is shown in a report of the civil
service commission on file in the sen
ate today. It was transmitted by Pres
ident Wilson in response to a resolu
tion by Senator Penrose. A confiden
tial communication accompanying the
report is being held for examination in
executve session.
Under chairmanship of Senator Fall,
republican of New Mexico, an unoffic
ial bureal for the investigation of Mex
ican affairs has been established here.
n Time to Nominate.
President Wilson decided today th?.t
It would be impossible to nominate be
fore the end of the present session of
congress the members of the shipping
board provided for by the shipping
bill, the members of the tariff com
mission created bv the revenue bill, or
the members of the board created by
the workmen's compensation, law.
