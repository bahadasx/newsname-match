Farmers Who Would go to
Town and City Men who
Would be Farmers.
Progressive Farmer.
This is written for just two
classes of men: farmers who
are tired of the farm and its hard
work, who believe the job of the
average city man is a snap, and
who are ready to sell out and
move to town; and city men
who are yearning for the freedom
from worry that they think
goes with farm life, who believe
that farming is easy, that the
sunshine and Ihe rain come just
right, and that the flowers are
always blooming and the birds
are always singing.
To the first of these, to the
farmer who is sick of his job
and would go to town, the best
thing you can possibly do is to
stick to your knitting. Wages
in town may appear large, but
the cost of living is generally
larger still. The city man can
barely furnish his family with
actual necessities on a salary of
$100 a month or less. Rent is to
pay, light, fuel, milk, vegetables,
even water to drink, have to be
paid for, and usually at prices
that are simply astonishing to
the average farmer.
On the other hand, the city
man who would farm too often
has failed to know and properly
consider the factors that make
for succes. He forgets that the
singing of the birds and the
blooming of the flowers go unnoticed
by the man who tramps
from daylight till dark behind a
balky mule through a rooty new
ground. When boll weevils get
the cotton or drouth gets the
corn, the poetry of farming takes
on a decidedly flat flavor.
Distant pastures always appear
greenest, and it is a human
falling to want what the other
leiiow Has. At a distance we
see only the good things, the
hard and disagreeable appearing
only with intimate association.
Of course if a farmer is absolute
ly certain that he can better his
condition by going to town, if
he is sure that he is doing the
best thing by himself, his wife
and his children, if he feels sure
he will make more money, iucreased
expenses considered,
find friends as good and work
as useful, and that his children
in the town will be as strong,
clean, moral, healthy, happy,
: i
muusirious men and women as
if kept in a country home, then
let him go.
Likewise to the town man
who would farm; the farm is a
place for hard work, and even
at that the average farm is yield
ing a low return on the {investment.
If vou are determined to
farm, ask yourself if you mind
getting uo regularly at four and
five o'clock in the morning; if
you can spend the night doctoring
a sick horse or cow, smiling
liie while; if you keep vour
temper serene while the roots in
the new ground are flying back
and barking your shins, and the
plow handles are digging you in
the ribs; if you can look on
while drouth and flood, bug and
worm take your crops, your
head "bloody but unbowed". If
you can do all these and a few
hundred others like them, then
possibly you have the "makings"of
a farmer in you.
Card of Thanks
I take this method of thanking
the voters of Mt. Croghan .
Township for loval support
given me in the recent primary 1
for commissioner. And ask a
continuance of same in the second
primary. 1

Strike is Off; Labor Leaders
Recall Strike Order
Washington, Sept. 2.?The
threat of a general railroad strike
which has been hanging like a
pall over the country for a
month was lifted tonight.
Three hours after Senate had
passed without amendment the
adamson eight-hour day bill,
passed by the House yesterday,
the heads of the four great rail
road employes brotherhoods
telegraphed (>00 odd code mes
sages to their general chairmen
in all parts of the country cancelling
the strike order issued a
wetk ago to take effect next
Monday morning at 7 o'clock.
The legislative expedient to
avert the strike was passed in
the Senate by a vote of 48 to 28
?almost a strict party vote?
amid stirring scenes, after many
Senators, Democrats and Repub- <
licans, had fought desperately to <
amend tbe measure by provisions
designed to prevent industrial
disasters in the future. Some
Senators, thoroughly aroused,
declared Congress was being
coerced into enactment of legislation
that it did not desire, and
that it knew would return to
plague it in the future. .
In both Houses the measure
was signed within a few minutes <
after the final vote in tbe Senate *
and it was sent at once to the
White House where President 1
Wilson will sign it at 7:30 o'clock
tomorrow morning, after his return
from Shadow Lawn.
Officials of the brotherhoods
who witnessed the final passage (
of the bill had announced early J
in the night that cancellation of J
the strike would not be ordered *
until the bill had been signed by j
the President and actually had 1
become- law. But later they 1
conferred, changed their minds
and flashed tbe code messages }
signalling to the waiting train- *
men of the country thru their (
chairmen, the word that a satis- *
factory settlement had been secured.
*
The bill that stopped the strike 1
provides that after January 1, I
1917, eight hours shall be regard- J
ed as a basis of reckoning for a
day's pay of men engaged in the 3
operation of railroad trains in *
interstate commerce (excepting 1
roads less than 100 miles long 1
and electric lines); that they ^
shall receive pro rata pay for
work in excess of eight hours,
and that their rate of compen- 1
sation shall not be changed *
pending an investigation, for f
from six to nine months by a c
commissson to be appointed by A
the President, to the effect of the ^
eight-hour day upon the rail- 1
roads. ^

John Hough Shot by Lewis
West
Camden, Aug. 30.?A serious
shooting affray occurred on
Main street here this afternoon
n which John Hough, formerly
>f this county, but now of near
Winnsboro, was seriously
wounded, and is now suffering
rom a bullet wound thru the
ridneys.
The trouble was of several
fears standing. Lewis West,
who did the shooting, was a
:>rother-in-law of John Hough.
Flough several years ago beat
his father in-law to death with a
shotgun, was tried and convictid
at court here and sentenced
o be electrocuted. His senence
was reprived, and later beore
going out of office was
granted a full pardon on Christ
nas day by Governor Blease.
Since being released from the
State prison Hough has been
naking his home around Kerihaw
and later moved to Winns
loro. Today was the first time
nembers of the family had
:ome in contact with him and
he shooting resulted.
At a late hour tonight Hough's
:ondition was unchanged and
te was taken to a Columbia hospital
on a late train. J. W.
Stover, a negro mail carrier,
who was passing by on a bi:ycle,
received a minor bullet
wound thru his leg.

Origin of Petrified Forest/
The "Petrified Forest" o( Arizona,
really a series of petrified
forests, lies a short distance south
of Adamana, on the line of the
Santa Fe Railway. There are
four "forests," included in a
Government reservation called
"Petrified Forest National Monument,"
created by presidential
proclamation in 1906. The name
"forest" is not stricklv appropriate,
for the petrified tree trunks
are all prostrate and are broken
into sections. The logs are the
remains of giant trees that grew
in Triassic time, the age of reptiles.
The trees were of several
kinds, but most of them were related
to the Norfolk Island pine,
now used for indoor decoration.
Doubtless they grew in a near-by

down a water-course and lodged
in some eddy or a sand bank.
Later they were buried bv sand
and clay, finally to a depth of
several thousand feet. The conversion
to stone was effected by
gradual replacement of the
woody material by silica in the
form called chalcedony, deposited
by under-ground watei. A
small amount of iron oxides deposited
at the same time has
given the brilliant and beautiful
brown, yellow, and red tints
which appear in much of the
material.
Some of the tree trunks are 6
feet in diameter and more than
100 feet in length. In the first
forest there is a line trunk that
forms a natural bridge over a
small ravine, the water having
first washed avVay the overlying
clay and sand then, following a
crevice, worked out the channel
underneath. The length of this
log is 110 feet, and the diameter
4 feet at the butt and 1 I 2 feet
at the top.
The petrified woods are beautiful
objects tor study. When
thin slices are carefully ground
down to a thickness of 0.003
inch or less and placed under
the microscope they show perfectly
the original wood structure,
all the cells being distinct,
though now they are replaced
by chalcedony.?U. S. Geological

Wadesboro Ansonian Advances
to $1.50 A Year
In connection with an an.
nouncement elsewhere in this
issue in regard to the high pi ice
of white paper, it is interesting
to note the following from the
top of the editorial columns 01
the Wadesboro Ansonian:
As announced some months
ago, the subscription price ot
The Ansonian will be advanced
from $1.00 to $1 50 on September
1st, 1916. This advance is made
necessary on account of the in
creased cost of paper and all
ather material used in making a
newspaper.
Sound Sense
A Mysterious building had
been erected on the outskirts of
a small town. It was shrouded
in mystery. All that was known
lbout it was that it was a chemical
laboratory. An old farmer,
seeing a man standing in the
ioorway, asked:
"What be ye doin' in this
a lace?"
"We are searching for a uni/ersal
solvent?something that
-vill dissolve all iliings," explained
th?? rliomisl
"What good will that be?''
"It will dissolve all tilings,
ust imagine, sir, if we want a
ol ntion of iron, glass, gold?
inything, all we have to do is to
Irop it into this solution."
"Fine!" remarked the old farm:r,
"fine! But what be ye goin'
o keep it in?"
Feed Will Be High-Priced: Plant 1
an Abundance of Forage
Crops
Progressive Farmer .
According to the estimates of ,
the United States Department of '
Agriculture, the corn crop of the $
corn states will this vear be be- ^
low the average, while in the
Cotton Belt certainly no more ''
than an average crop at best 1
may be expected. Already these 1
facts are being reflected in highpriced
corn, prices in Southern (
towns now varying from $1 to
$t.25 per bushel, with the prob *
ability next spring of higher 1
prices still. J
To ftVPrv fdrmpr in tVio *

with whom there is the least ]
possibility of a shortage of feed ,
during the next twelve months,
the best course to pursue should (
be clear: the thing to do is to ;
sow oats, and sow them now;
put in rape for fall grazing, and
rye and crimson clover for
winter and spring grazing. We
simply can't afford to pay $1.25 ,
a bushel for corn next spring, ,
and wise indeed is the man who
takes precaution now against 1
any such possibility. ]
In this connection let us urge '
anew the need for planting these 1
crops earlv. Fall-planted oats ?
nearly everywhere in the Cotton
Belt have on an averaere nearlv
doubled in yield the crops from (
spring plantings. At the Ala- *
bama Station, for instance, the
increase was about 125 per cent '
in favor of fall planting?more
than double. In the northern (
half of the belt, September is the
best month to sow, while in the ?
southern half the crop should be
put in not later than the end of ?
October if possible. The winter 1
grazing crops, too, should be (
seeded early if much grazing is
to be furnished before spring.
Abruzzi rye sowed in September *
will generally give very fair 1
grazing by Christmas, and crim
son clover put in now will usual ?
ly give good grazing from the ?
end of February till May.
