Ultimatum
Washington, Sept. 5.—Sweeping de­
mands, far more drastic than any pub­
lished summaries have indicated, are
revealed in the secret terms being
pressed on China by Japan as a re­
sult of the recent armed conflicts be­
tween soldiers of the two nations at
Cheng Chiatun, in inner Mongolia.
Private dispatches received here to­
day reveal that Japan seekg indemni
tes and apologies and political conces­
sions throughout the whole section of
inner Mongolia and South Manchuria.
The formal demands as quoted are
as follows:
Punishment of the commanding Chi­
nese officer involved in the trouble.
Dismissal, with punishment, of the
other officers involved.
Instructions to Chinese troops in in­
ner Mongolia and south Manchuria
not to interfere in any way with Jap­
anese troops or civilians, and to pub­
lish thisjact .brgaiUx...,
Recognition of "special interests"
for Japan in inner Mongolia and south
Manchuria, comprising powers of po­
lice and administration, preference in
loans and the selection of all foreign
advisers, etc.
Four Concessions Asked.
Besides the four "demands" are
four concessions, which China is ask­
ed to grant Japan without formal de­
mand, as follows
The Chinese army in south Man­
churia and eastern Mongolia to em­
ploy Japan military advisers.
Chinese schools and colleges to have
Japanese inspectors. This is not lim­
ited to any section in dispatches so
for received.
A formal apology in person from the
Chinese governor of Mukden to the
Japanese governor at Dairen, and the
Japanese consul at Mukden, for the
Cheng Chiatun trouble.
Monetary compensations to the fam­
ilies of the Japanese killed, the
amounts to be settled by later nego­
tiations.
Secretary Lansing refused tonight
to comment on the dispatches or to
outline what might be the attitude of
the American government. It is
known, however, that steps will be
taken immediately by the state depart­
ment to secure detailed reports and
learn the full significance of Japan's
act. American interest seemed at
first glance to be more involved than
in any event in the Far East since
Japan's famous ultimatum to China of
May, 1915.

YOUNG DETECTVES
ESCAPE IDENTITY
Chicago, Sept. 5.—Small boys, who
saw a victim shot down in the heart
of the "Black Hand" district last
night, took up the trail of the assas­
sin.
The boys were standing nearby
when a man crept up behind Charles
Davarca as he sat in front of his
grocery store on Milton aveoue and
sfetr him ia the b'jitik.
Before the sound of the shot died
&wdy residents of the district had
scuttled indoors, as invariably is the
custom when the popping of pistols
is heard in the "Black Hand" district.
But the iboys slipped along in the
shadows as the assassin fled and turn­
ed into WIells street after him. A
short distance away they saw Police­
men Joseph Fogarty and Harold
O'Brien.
He shot a man," one of the boys
said. "We followed him."
The policemen grabbed the man,
who was in his shirt sleeves, and took
a revolver away from him, (He said
he was Philip .Scalletta, 844 Milton
avenue. When the policemen were
questioning him the boy detectives
scampered away.
At a hospital where Davarca was
taken he identified Scalletta as hi3
assailant. Scalletta said he had quar­
reled with Davarca over payment lor
wine. The police believe Davarca
had offended the Black hand.
RATIFICATION OF
TREATY RECOMMENDED
Washington, Sept. 5—A report from
the foreign relations committee recom­
mending ratification of the treaty with
Denmark for purchase of the Danish
West Indies for $25,000,000 was sub­
mitted to the senate late today, in
executive session. Senator Stone,
chairman of the committee, announc­
ed he would call the treaty up tomor­
row and moved its ratification.
Probability of the treaty being rati­
fied at this session of congress, how­
ever, is regarded as remote. Senator
Stone said no effort would be made to
delay adjournment, if any opposition
develops. Senator Borah, for one, Is
opposed to the purchase, and any op­
position to immediate ratification will
serve to send the treaty over until the
next session.

29 of 49 Members of Central
Body
NON-PARTISANS ASSERT
THEY WILL HAVE CONTROL
National Republican Ticket and
Platform Complete Will
Be Endorsed
Both the regular and the Non-parti
san league leaders last night claimed
a majorty of the delegates to the state
.central committee of the Republican
party, which will meet this afternoon
at the state capitol to'organize.
The Democrats and the Socialists
will also copvene.
•Th# regulars assert that they will
have 29 of the 49 delegates, while the
league men are not claiming any defi­
nite number but assert that they will
be in full control.
Treadwell Twitchell of Fargo is
leading the conservative faction and
it is rumored that he will be its candi­
date for chairman.
Headquarters of both factions are at
the Grand Pacific hotel. The Nonparti­
san leaders and delegates conferred
yesterday afternoon and will hold an­
other conference at 10 o'clock today.
Lemke for Chairman.
William Lemke of Fargo, the Non­
partisan league's attorney, it is under
stood, will be its candidate for chair­
man, while Ray McHaig of Mandan is
slated for secretary.
Lynn J. Frazier, Republican candi­
date for governor, attended yester
day's conference. F. B. Wood of Deer
ing, one of the organizers of the Non­
partisan league, was also present. Wil­
liam Langer, candidate for attorney
general Thomas Hall, candidate foi
secretary of state, and Carl R. Kositz
ky, candidate for state auditor, all
men endorsed by the Non-partisans,
conferred with the leaders last night.

No matter which side gains control,
the Republican national ticket and
platform and the party's congressional

the league leaders will try to have
adopted are:
Terminal elevators.

Civil service.
Government by budget system.
Endorsement of national ticket and
platform.

Frank Sprague, present chairman,
will call the committee to order at
1:30 p. m.
A general feeling seemed to prevail
last night that Mr. Frazier, in view of
his emphatic endorsement in the June
primary, should be permitted, as has
been the custom in the past, to desig­
nate the chairman.
Frazier Urges Civil Service.
Mr. Frazier is much interested in
the move to adopt civil service regula­
tions. He believes that by taking
many of the appointive offices out of
politics the state government can be
made just as efficient as private busi­
ness.
E. H. Stenwick, Fred McLean and J.
Nelson Kelly have been mentioned for
chairmen of the Democratic state cen­
tral committee.
Norman Black, secretary of the
Good Government league, arrived last
night and will attend the meeting of

That Desperadoes May At

El Paso, Tex., Sept. 5.—Francisco
Villa, with a band estimated at from
700 to 1,500 men, jias succeeded in
making his way into fastnesses of the
Santa Clara canywn, and yesterday
was in the vicinity of Tepehuanes,
about 50 miles south and east of the
American lines atJSI Valle, Chihuahua,
according to private dispatches here
today.
A Carranza forcV. headed by Gener­
al Elisio Dondo, is said to be in pur­
suit.
It is believed the bandit is in search
of ammunition hidden in the canyon.
May be Planning Attack.
San Antonio, Sept. 5.—The possibil­
ity that Francisco Villa is making his
way to the northwest with the inten
1 ion of attacking some portion of Gen­
eral Pershing's expeditonary force
was considered at Major General Fun
ston's headquarters tonight.
General Funston said he had receiv­
ed a telegram from General Bell at El
Paso, containing the gist of a report
from General Gonzales in Juarez, in
which the latter confirmed the definite
location of Villa's force in the Santa
Clara canyon. General Gonzales said
he had dispatched troops to engage
Villa.
Granted that General Gonzales' in­
formation is true, General Funston
said he regarded it as not at all im­
probable that Villa was planning to
engage the Americans at some point.
"Wo muy iiu.ce iiome excitement
soon," he observed.

Washington, Sept. 5.—Arrange­
ments to forward mail to the Philip­
pines by army transports, announced
in San Francisco yesterday, was fol­
lowed by official announcement that
mails for the United States postal
agency at Shanghai no longer would
be dispatched through Vancouver, B.
C. The purpose, ostensibly, is to re­
move the mails from British inter­
ference. The decision to carry mails
to the Philippines on army transports
involved the state and war depart­
ments and postoffice department. Of­
ficials all were reticent today to talk
about the plans.

Dr. Gary Grayson's halfbreed Indian
boyhood hunting companion was not
in his accustomed place on the sta­
tion platform today when the special
train carrying President Wilson from
Hodgensville, Ky., to Washington,
pulled into Culpepper. The president
and his physician came out and were
looking anxiously about for the gaunt
figure, when someone in the waiting
crowd handed up this note, address­
ed to Dr. Grayson:
"Your friend, Cooney, was caught
in a crap game last night and is
locked up. He regrets he cannot see
you, but hopes you will give his re­
gards to the president."

SECTION IS RETAINED
Washington, s^pt. 5.—The adminis­
tration emergency revenue bill, de­
signed to raise $:50,000,000 annually
from taxes on inheritances and war
munitions, and from increases in the
income tax, creating a tariff commis­
sion, establshing a protective tariff on
dyestuffs, providing for protection of
American firms from "dumping" at
the end of the war and giving the
president authority to take drastic re­
taliatory steps against allied interfer­
ence with American trade, was passed
late tonight by the senate. The vote
was 42 to 1(5.
Eliminating the usual formalities in
order to insure adjournment of con­
gress, by. Thursday, by the latest, the
seriate rusfied the measure, the lasfrof

Five Republican senators, Cummins,
Kenyon, LaFollette, Norris and Clapp,
voted for the bill. There were no Dem­
ocratic nays.
Reject Underwood's Motion.
By a vote of 55 to 5, the senate re­
jected Senator Underwood's motion,
thus retaining the tariff commission
section of the bill. Senators who vot­
ed to eliminate it were Bankhead,
Hardwick, Shields, Underwood and
Vardaman.
A motion by Senator Penrose to
send the bill back to the finance com­
mittee, with instructions to raise rev

special provisions for industrial de
fense, was rejected by a vote of 39 to

LINE DP WITH MNDM
Minot and Valley City, active con­
tenders for the million-dollar Equity
packing plant until the meeting of
the committee iMonday, have thrown
their support to iMandan.
The people of Valley City made a
strong and bitter fight against Fargo,
claiming that city, lying right on the
edge of the state, had "hogged"
everything in sight. IMandan did not
participate in this acrimonious discus­
sion, but that there was a bitterness
engendered over Fargo's wish to be
the whole state, and to get the farm­
ers from all over the state to con­
tribute to this enterprise and locate
it in Fargo rather than to locate the
plant more centrally, was apparent
after the meeting.
Minot's and Valley City's forces are
now aligned with iMandan as against
Fargo, and with the whole central
and western part of the state sup­
porting this city, it is difficult to un­
derstand how the committee can do
otherwise than finally select Mandan.
Mandan's delegation was the only
one to present a concrete proposition,
to make an absolute offer of a select­
ed site. The other cities dealt only
in generalities.
There are four strong points which
stand out strongly in favor of Man­
dan:
First—An incomparable site, pos­
sessing all the requirements set forth
in the specifications an acreage of
700 acres.
Second—Absolutely the best drain­
age for thp water and waste products
of the plant.
Third—The greatest water supply
in the state, the Missouri river.
Fourth—Central location, Mandan
being just 52 miles from the geo­
graphical center of the state.
Fifth—The greatest saving in
freight rates, and the advantage of
enjovine the Missouri river rate
classification for all shipments to the
Pacific coast, the preatest market for
the surplus products of the plant.
Sixth—The location at the greatest!
source of supply for cattle, hogs and I
sheep. I

Strike Is
Postponed
New York, Sept. 5.—After a confer­

ed tonight there would he no strike on
the subway and elevated lines of this
city for at least 48 hours.
Mayor Mitchell, who is at the mili­
tary training camp for civilians at
Plattsburgh, N. Y., is expected to re­
turn to this city tomorrow.
Theodore Shonts, vice-president of
the company, tonight denied the charg­
es of the union representatives that
intimidations or coercion had been
used to get the subway or elevated em­
ployes to sign a so-called "servant
and master's agreement," binding
them not to seek wage increases for
two years.

PRES. PREPARING FOR
CONGRESS ADJOURNMENT
Washington, Sept. 5.—President Wil­
son returned today from Hwjigensville,
Ky., and Immediately began work in­
cident to adjournment of congress.
Friday he goes to Atlantic City to ad­
dress the National American Suffrage
association.
After his Atlantic City address, the
president plans to establish himself at

Long Branch, N. J., and remain there
during practically all the presidential
campaign. The executive offices will
be moved to Asbury Park, N. J., Fri­
day.
On his return trip from Hodgens

Newlands of the joint congressional
sub-committee on railroads, a member
of his party, to begin as soon as pos
sible an investigation of questions
growing out of the recently threaten­
ed railroad strike.
PHILLIPS AHEAD IN
RAGE FOR GOVERNOR
Milwaukee, Wis., Sept. 5.—Early
scattering returns from today's pri
mary election in Wisconsin indicate
that Gov. E. L. Phillips, conservative
Republican, has been nominated gov­
ernor, over three opponents, beyond
a doubt, and that LaFollette and Jef­
fries are running a close race for the
Republican nomination for United
States senator.
Primary election returns up to
10:30 o'clock tonight indicate United
States Senator LaFollette has been
nominated for United States senator,
over M. G. JefTries.
The Republican state ticket will un­
doubtedly ibe headed by Gov. Phillips,
who apparently carries with him Hen­
ry Johnson, as nominee for state
treasurer. The LaFollette appears to
have nominated E. F. Dithmar for
lieutenant governor, Merlin Hull for
secretary of state, and Walter Owen,
for attorney general, the nominees
on the whole being two Phillips can­
didates and three LaFollette follow­
ers.

and 36 guns, 2S of them being of
heavy caliber.
On the eastern front, violent fight­
