TO BEGIN INQU
INTO O
Department of Justice Officials t
Taking Up Matter Ftom Three J
Angles, While Congressmen t
Also Consider Action to Bring t
Prices Downward. e
Washington, Dec. 6.?The federal v
investigation of the high cost of liv- f
ing began today to take definite
form, with indications that it would
be one of the most comprehensive .
ever undertaken and would extend to
every section of the United States. Not s
only is a sweeping inquiry into the f
causes of the soaring cost of food- v
stuffs contemplated, but the recent f
pinch in the coal supply and its resultant
price advances also will be
made, in all probability, the subject I
of broad investigation. t
From President Wilson down, ofli- fc
cials began efforts to cope in earnest t
with the problems presented by the 0
situation. The president took under
consideration preliminary reports j
which with others yet to come will a
form the hasis for recommendations \
he may make to congress. t
A dozen speeches on the subject J
were made in the house and several J
resolutions proposing inquiries were d
introduced. These were referred to r
committees without discussion, most f
of them going to the interstate and J
foreign commerce committee, of t
which Representative Adamson, who
is opposed to embargoes, is the chair- t
man. c
Department of justice officials held r
.,11 .1-,,, ? -in. ?
.... tumciciiic!) wilii uiemners 01 e
.ho federal trade commission and s
District Attorney Anderson of Tlos- i
ton, in charge of the department's in- g
vestigation and here to formulate a (
definite plan of conducting the nation-wide
inquiry. About 50 picked | *
members of the department's bureau
of investigation were reported to be
at work throughout thq country t
gathering data which will determine *
the attorney general's course. 1
Commission May Aid*.
The interstate commerce commis- *
gion probably will be called upon toll
aid by furnisl|frg rel^
deraon will Confer with * eomrnhisfmi 1
officials before his departure. Grand
jury investigations at New York or 1
Chicago, or both, of the reasons for 1
raising prices are said to be still un- J
der consideration.
With the program still in process
of formation there were increasing indications
that officials were consider- j
ing the situation from three angles. ^
namely: ^
1. Determination of the actual j
causes of the rapid rise in foodstuffs ^
and coal, whether it was due to natural
economic laws, to the unwar- ,
ranted action of individual dealers f
and producers in advancing prices, j
or whether there exist agreements _
among groups of dealers or producers
to boost prices.
o XT?
vigorous prosecution ol persons ,
or firms, if any, who by violation of ^
existing laws in making agreements
to raise prices or otherwise have *
contrubted to the upward trend of
prices.
' 3. Enactment of legislation to rem- '
edy the present situation and to prevent
its recurrence.
At First Stage Now. 'j
The situation is in the first of these j
stapes, so far as the department of j
justice is concerned. With its inves- ]
tigators already at work department j
officials called upon the federal trade %
commission for cooperation and were s
promised aid. In addition department
officials are understood to be consid- r
erinp the advisability of havinp such j
organizations as the Chicago Board of c
Trade, the Chicapo Butter and Epp j
exchange, the Elgin Board of Trade c
and the New York Produce, Sugar and
Coffee exchanges investigated with a f
view to ascertaining by what practices v
the market values of certain foodstuffs
dealt in by these bodies are deter- a
mined. An inquiry into the amount
of foodstuffs held in all the c^.u storage
establishments of the country and
possibly as to the volume of grain '
j 1 ' - * * 1 "
niurtu in eievaiors also IS said 10 De '
under consideration.
Complaints have reached the department
that coal prices were advanced ^
recently because, in large measure, of
the activities of certain independent
dealers, not heretofore in the busi- (
ness, who are reported to have con- j
tracted with the c'lief coal companies
for virtually their entire unsold out- ,j
put for the winter. It was charged
that these dealers, scenting fat profits, .
had tried to corner the available supply
and thus forced up prices.
These and other complaints under ^
investigation will be considered with
a view of prosecution, if warranted, (
under federal laws which require that
the supplies in question must have ?
been in or for interstate commerce. ^
Proposals in congress looking to a
remedy for the problem ranged from
a discussion of the omnibus hatcheries
bill which would provide for fish e

MRS. SALLIE STRING FELLOW
DIED IN GAINESVILLE DEC. 2
Formerly of Union, a Member of Old
Family Here?Burial in Presbyterian
Cemetery Monday.
Mrs. Sallie Stringfellow died in
Gainesville, Florida, Saturday, Dec. 2,
and her remains were brought to Union
for burial Monday in the Presbyterian
cemetery. She was the daughter
of the late Dr. J. II. Dogan, one of
Union's prominent citizens. Mrs.
Stringfellow is survived by two daughters,
Mrs. Rosa Wright Ruger of
Devil's Lake, North Dakota, and Mrs.
Sallie Walker, of Gainesville, Florida,
and three sons, J. I"). Stringfellow, T.
B. Stringfellow and Robert L. Stringfellow
of Gainesville, Fla.
The burial was conducted by Kev.
John F. Matheson, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church.
Mrs. Stringfellow was a woman possessed
of a beautiful character, and
her long life was one that brought
blessings to all those with whom she
came in contact. Her highly cultivated
mind and high ideals made
her a woman of great and good influences
in every sphere of life.
The following is taken from The
Daily Sun, Gainesville, Florida:
"The death of Mrs. Sarah A. Stringfellow,
widow of Dr. Wm. II. Stringfellow,
which occurred at the home of
her daughter, Mrs. E. S. Walker, 701)
East Main street, north, at i>:!10 Saturday
morning, was a shock to her
family and many friends in this city.
She had not been ill, but because of
her ripe old age she fell asleep like a
tired child, and her gentle, spirit has
gone to dwell in eternal glory.
"Deceased was born in Union, S. ('.
March F>, IS'28. She was married to
Dr. W. 11. Stringfellow in isr><>, and
in that same year they came to Florida
and located at Fort Clark on what |
has since been known as the String-j
fellow farm. They were large slave I
owners and Dr. Stringfellow planted
on a large scale until two years after
the close of the war. or in 1867, when
they removed to Gainesville, where
Mrs. Stringfellow has resided with her
children since the death of her husband,
until now, after a long and
wBeTui me, rrrias preaked God t6 call
her home.
"She is survived by three sons, J. D.
and T. B. Stringfellow, of this city,
and R. L. Stringfellow of Jacksonville,
and two daughters, Mrs. Major
S. Walker of this city, and Mrs.
Rosa Rigger of Devil's Lake, North
Dakota, also one step-daughter, Mrs.
G. K. Broome, of this city, besides
a number of grandchildren, and these
have the sympathy of a host of
friends. Mrs. Stringfellow was a
member of the Presbyterian church,
and was loved by all who knew her.
"Funeral services will be held this
afternoon at 1:30 at the First Presbyterian
church, conducted by the pastor(
Dr. J. G. Anderson. The following
gentlemen who will act as pallI
bearer ,are requested to meet at the i
residence of Major F. S. Walker, on |

Discuss Possibility of War
Ending at an Early Date?
Peace Based Upon Business
Predicted.
London, Dec. 6.?An article predicting
the approaching peace negotiations
has appeared in the Berlin
Taireblatt and is quoted in an Amsterdam
despatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company. The TaReblutt
says:
"The moment is near when a business
peace will be possible?a peace
which the allies and the central powers
can discuss in view of the securities
they possess. Of coure those
who consider such a proposal must
not be allowed to return home emptyhanded.
The status quo ante helium
is impossible since the independence
of Poland is proclaimed but it is remarkable
that the number of (tor
mans who wish to annex Belgium
has shrunk recently to almost nothing
while many pan-Germans are
ready today to listen to the word
'pacifism' without protest."
The Tagblatt says that the fact
that Germans wants a business peace
is a sign not of weakness hut of
common sense. The Vossische ZeiMing
also mints an article discussing
the possibility of peace. It ays:
"Probably Ambassador Gerad D returning
to Germany with some peace
proposal." If such is the case, the
paper goes on. America is an unsuitable
mediator and it warns Germany
to acept the services of President
Wilson only as a messenger and not
as an arbitrator.
E11H of War Nearer
Berlin, Dec. t'>. via Sayville.- -Editorials
appeared in virtually all the
newspapers yesterday commenting on
the present political situation as influenced
by recent military events in
Rumania and economic conditions in
the entente countries and stating that
apparently the sentiment for peace
has been strengthened in these countries.
A. majority of the newspapers
speak of the possible inventions of
Ambassador Gerad on his return from
the United States and of the rumors
that a British ministerial crisis is impending.
The Vossische Zeitung says:
"We all feel the end of the war
has been brought considerably nearer
by the events of recent weeks. Even
statesmen seem to recognize this, although
their words lack clearness."
The Yossische Zeitung says peace
negotiations wore not discussed seriously
in the United States until Great
Britain's plight became apparent and
that 'his was not a conincidence but
was due to Anglo-American solidarity,
and continues:
"We ought never to forget that it is
to the interest of the United States
to support Great Britain's position for
:ts own sake at the end of the war.
In America everybody is conscious of
that fact that a settlement of the
ouestion concerning the Pacific between
the United States and Japan
is only a question of time. The natural
ally of the United States in this
threatening struggle is England."
