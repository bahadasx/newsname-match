lives were lost, already has been
prj.ared, are denied from compe
tent administration sources.
The president, it is explained, does
not consider that he as yet has suf

decision and will tiefer any aetioa
until all of the information can be

stated that there has been no
change In the attitude of this gov
ernment and its position as outlined
in the last Sussex note, is un
changed. The state department. actin
under instructions from the white
house today. sent to Ambassador
I'ae at Iondon a summary of the
latest German note, which justified
the sinking of the Arabia as a Prit

The ambassador already has in
his possession the derma n request

cases and to ask the British admir

the embassy that the Arabia was a

was "sunk without warning while

This information, however, took no

today in his annual report to th

Strategic considerations demand
that a site on the shores of the
