IMPROVEMENT OF LIVE STOCK
(By J. R. Hutehcson, Specialist in An
imnl Husbandry, Department of Ag
riculture.)
Before we can expect any marker'
improvement in the live stock on ou
farms we have got to make up out
minds to do two things. First, breci
better, and second, feed beltter. Ii
this paper I am going to try to dis
cuss tho first of these briefly and giv
to the farmers some of thincs workc
out at the Experiment Station am
I are being used by practical farm
?rs in ninny sections of the State.
The subject of breeding is too bit
a subject to bo discussed in n papei
of this kind, but I do want to empha
size the importance of pure brei
bulls. Too many of our farmers d<
not realize how really important thi
point is. I do not hesitate to say tha
a farmer had hotter pay S?.OO for tlv
service fee of a good pure-bred hul
than to have the service free of ;
scrub given him. A calf sired by ;
good pure bred beef hull is wort.!
from $10 to $120 more as a two-year,
old than n calf sirod by a scrub. This I
has been proven time and again b}
practical cattlemen. The chief draw?
back in tho farmer using pure-brer!
bulls is the cost of those animals
but it can be easily see from the
above figures that a farmer who has
as many as fifteen or twenty cows
will be handsomely repaid by an in
vestment in a pure-bred bull. Where
the farmers have only a few cows I
am advocating several going togethei
and buying the hull and using hin:
cn-operattvelv. Instead of one farm
er (owning a $.r>() scrub, let four farm
ers go together and put ?50 each int<
tho proposition and get a ?200 bull
Many farmers in this State are doinr
this successfully. A good highly brei'
puro-bred bull calf will usually cost '
from $100 up. I want to say righ
m-o when buving a bull, dont buy
one that is "fifteen-sixteenths" pure
bred, or one that is just subject to
registration. When you pay out your
good money ho sure to get a pure?
bred registered bull. The better the
brooding tho greater the profits as
a rule.
Whenever possible it is always ;?
good plan for all beef cattle raisers in
a county to use tho same breed beef
bull. Organize one breed and le'
member of the organization push this
breed. If this is dono, the countv will
bncomo noted for one breed of cat?
tle and buyers will come to this coun?
ty because they know thev can get j
uniform, high erode, and pure-bred
cattle. In Russell county, and sev?
eral other counties in the' Southwest,
? best farmers hnvo taken up this
work and organized to push Short?
horn cattle. Tho Russell County
Stock Breeder's Association is one .if
the best organizations of its kind in '
this or any other Southern State.
This company has put over 50 pure?
bred Shorthorn hulls into the county
within the last vear and tho plan is
?t n pure-brod Shorthorn bull
within tho reach of every farmer in
tho county.
CP-OPERATIVE LIVE STOCK AS?
SOCIATIONS.
(By W. H. Rurress, County Agent of
Lee County.)
When we ask ourselves tho ques?
tion: "What is the most important
activity in Southwest Virginin?" wc
eo-operata in answering that live
Siock raising is the chief industry now
und always will be the prime factor
in our wealth development. This
jeinir true what are the factors that
.iii influence our progress?
1. The kind of live stock we raise.
'<. The treatment given that live!
stock.
3. The business discretion shown in
selling our product.
This article deals with the first fac?
tor, "The Kind of live stock we raise,"
..ud will laue up the most important
..hid of live stock raised in Southweest
Virginia?the beef cattle. It will try
to, siiow by a practical illustration
A'hat kind of cattle we should keep
?a order to com ma ml the best prices
on all markets.
Two years ago seven Lee County
Hereford breeders came together and
organized wdiat is known as the Lee
Jounty Hereford Breeders' Assoeia
cion. These men owned about 1??
i>ure bred Hereford cattle and from
.heir cows they had been selling the
waives for an average price not .ex?
ceeding $00. $100 was the highest
price ever paid for a pure bred calf,
/cry little interest had been taken in
.he pure bred hcrefords and they re?
ceived no belter treatment than the
,;rado steers that were sold for feed?
ers and killers. Immediately after
?he men agreed to co-operate in im?
proving the herds. A sale was sched?
uled to take place about seven months
from that time. A committee was ap?
pointed to inspect and reject all ani?
mals that were not good enough to
_ro into the sale. This commitlue se?
eded an offering that was broad, low
and level preparation for the sale was
.he next step taken by the consign?
ors. When the auctioneer sold the
18th calf, which was the last one in
the sale, the average price received
went to $129. This, as will be seen,
was around $70 more a head than had
been previously paid by buyers hero
in Lee county.
Seeing the wonderful improvement
made by using pure bred bulls on '
grade cows, and seeing that there was
.:ii opening for greater profits from
the pure bred business than from ,
any other form of live slock raising,
fourteen other good stock raisers
have joined the Lee County Hereford
Association and today there are about
;I50 Hereford cattle in Lee county.
This year a sale was held at the Leo
County Fair ami 24 Herefords sold;
for an average of $168, $11,500 worth)
of Herefords have brought into the |
county during the last 18 months, j
At the Virginia State Fair this year I
the grand champion female was a'
Leo county Hereford and $11,500 was .
refused for the purple ribbon calf.
Ninety per cent of the puro bred i
bulls sold by the Leo County breed?
ers have been purchased by Lee coun- |
ly cattle raisers and this has placed j
a much better class of calves in the
county than could have been placed
here by scrub bulls. The prices ran
from $10 to $20 more for each calf
paid at weening time than when sired
by a scrub. These figures are not
theoretical but are actual and if you
question them, your question will bo
answered when you come to Lee coun?
ty to buy feeders.
This article deals with Herefords
because Lee county is being taken as
an example. Other breeds could be
shown to be doing great things in
other Virginia counties. The secret
to the entire plan is found in the one
small word which has so much mean?
ing. Co-operation is the word and
with this word circulating through a
man's system in thought nnd action
the next thought is combination nnd
with these two spirits we have or?
ganization which will lead to the for?
mation of a live stock association.
Such associations in Southwest Vir?
ginia will be seen to give the best
quality of live stock found in Amer?
ica.
Suppose that within the next live
years every calf born In Southwest
Virginia is sired by a pure bred bull,
how much greater would be the in?
come than if the calves were sired
by scrub bulls? The increase is too
large to assume n definite number of
dollars, but truly it would be some?
thing enormous. In order to advance
rapidly we must begin where the
most good will be derived and a pure?
bred bull association will bo a good
start. Therefore, let every county
in Southwest Virginia begin a co?
operative campaign to replace the
scrub bull with a puro bred sire.

DOG CENSUS IS

Sergeant Meeting With "Howl?
ing" Success in Listing Ca?
nines From Innocent Poodles
to hloon-baying Hounds.
Sergeant Thompson im itiuKing u
cloua-up of tlio dogs in town. Tho
question of dog tuxes has herootforo
boon lightly treated. Tho town lixos
a tax of $1.00 on dogs and $1.50 on
female dogs, and prescribes that u
?enden pill of tho regulation size ho
imposed where the tux is not paid,
the Sergeant is enforcing this ordi
iinhcu to the letter. Up tu und in

togs have been registered on thu ;>ei

the ilogs are saiil to bu a lhi<

far the ilog campaign has hern a
howling success, ami nearly nil the

ury enriched. On Sergeant Jiminj
Itaghy Thompson's little black book
containing the list of dogs ltiu| their
owners, it. was noted that certain dugs
were marked with a ring around
the tax duo. This meant, the S?r
gennt explained., thai "that dog is to
he, or has been, shot." The Ser?
geant's trusty .32 will he heard and
dogs will howl, A fow people have

One man, who owned u long-legged,
slnbsidcd, lank old hound, said that
he bail given the dog away, but he
wouldn't stay give, and would he de?

Mr. Davidson has recently recovered
from a serious liver trouble, which at
one time threatened his lifo. Ho re?
gards his cur?! and recovery ns won?
derful?almost miraculous. Ho took
treatment from a celebrated special?
ist in Baltimore. When he went to
Baltimore he was unable to walk to
tho doctor's office. After a treat?
ment, covering a period of about two
years, he was pronounced well by the
physicians and now scorns strong and
hearty as he ever was. He says the
doctor gave him no medicine whatev?

STOLE PROPERTY PROM THE
BAPTIST CHURCH.
Some petty thief a week or so ago,
purloined from the Baptist church a
coal scuttle, a new broom and the two
collection baskets. This is the IIrat
instance we believe, of a theft from
i church in this town. The collection
' is els were made of willow, with
eng handles and of what use they
an he to any one except for church
ullcctionw is not easy to imagine.

ONCE AGAIN
We Are Aller Turkeys To
Supply Thousands of
Homes With a Good
Christmas Dinner.
and we will need thousands of fine TURKEYS. How many
can we depend on receiving from you? Would advise you to
start in at once and get your trukeys as fat as you can if
you are a grower, and if you tire a buyer select nothing but
the best grades for thismarket, and if your turkeys are line
there is no doubt but what they will sell high. We can get
you as much money out of your shipments of dressed
Poultry as any other firm in this city, and if you have not
as yet given us a trial ask your neighbors what we have
done for them and be convinced. A one cent postal will
bring to yon our opinion its to the TURKEY situation, also
cards, so write today. Our location and ability is second to
none in tliis city.
NOW
enough has been said about what we can do?give us a
chance to SHOW you. Let our past record of handling large
and small shipments from you and adjoining counties speak
for itself. Do not be afraid of shipping too many fine TUR?
KEYS. I am right here personally working among the
trade taking orders daily from the best trade in and around
this city, at top prices. It would have been a great pleasure
to have visited each shipper and personally talked with you,
but the time being short I could do man yshippers more
good by staying here sind working among the buyers find?
ing out their wants. Would advise you to have your ship?
ments of dressed POULTRY arrive here from the 19th to
the 22nd, inclusive, to strike the best market.
