New Hope Thanksgiving j ;
As announced it would be in

bo it waa, or more so The mem
bers of New Hope Church and
members of other denominations
contiguous more than rdet the
high expectations of those, who
went for their'thanksgiying din
ner, and Bupper to New Hope,
among , which we were . .what.
We - attended the dedication of
the Church when we were a
small boy about 20 years ago,
and on this occasion the feast
was more than sumptuous, tho a
basket dinner at the dedication
whereas Thursday it was wagon
loads of good things. 28 tur

The crowd began to assemble
by 10 a. m. and serving dinner
began at 1150. Tables at which
70 could be seated were railed
off in the rear of the church and
cooking and carving done in
rear rooms. It was' next to im
possible to keep the crowd back
until it could be served in regu
lar order, and but for the heavy
bag: railing and the two small
entrances guarded by stalwert
men like Judge W. N. Hamilton,
a bread riot would have taken
place then and there.
Misses Dean and Inez Purley
of Kirksville came on special
invitation to make music for the
diners, and Miss Inez with vio
lin and Miss Dean accompanying
lent no little to the complete en
joyment of the day and evening.

Survey Made and Terminal Se

ous. ; We Lose . ;
From the best information ob
tainable, the Santa Fe-Burhng-ton
railroads will complete' the?r
lines to St. Louis by building op
the route surveyed between the
Wabash and Grand river ajt
Brunswick entering that city '.si
the western suburb and parall
elling the Wabash thru Dal tot

where it takes a straight course
nearly south east to near thf
Hamilton crossing, in othe:
words, on the line surveyed an

be asked to vacate the stree1

wick and a heavy retaining wall
will be put in where the railroad
would likely , be interfered with!
by Grand river. 4 j
The Santa Fe has ordered a
bonus be paid to all its employees
who receive, less than $2000 a
year, the bonns to be 10 per cent
of salaries received during the
past two years and totaling: two
and three quarter million dollars.
President Ripley says that the
business of his road -has been
abnormally good for two years
and it can afford to do better by
its faithful employees. v' . ;:
If the line from Carrollton to
Mexico is built where the com
plete survey has been made, it
will be about two and one half
miles south of this City and three
miles south of Salisbury, south
of Moberly and as direct as
practicable from Carrollton to
Mexico. The rumor that Jthe
double track between, Carrollton
and Dean Lake or Whitham may
be used for a time may or may
not be true, but that such an
arrangement will not be perma
nent appears 'settled.

THE EUROPEAN II
Bucharest and Roumanian Army
Captured by Germany
Court Peace
What was suspected by Eng
land and France a week ago,
took place Wednesday when the
Austro-German armies surround
ed and captured Bucharest and
probably the entire Roumanian
army. In "view of that great
calamity to the Allies, France
was thrown into political tur
moil and Englands Cabinet
forced to resign. Premier As
quith resigned and David Lloyd
George, War minister placed at
the head of the Kingdom's af-
aira. '
Greece is sure to join the Cen
tral powers since the Allies forc
ed her army to give up its arms
and the way is open for another
urkish invasion of Russian
provinces.
Germany declared for peace
on terms leaving her own terri
torytoher and an outlet to the
markets of the world. France
and England have rapidly grow
mg sentiment for peace and
Russia has been ready at every
backset to agree to end the war.
The relative positions of the
armies in France are about the
same as a week ago..

Dryden.
The Commercial Geography
class ree'd a number of exhibits

leum, beverages, medicinal sub
stances and guns. We have ten
exhibits in all.
Victor Williams was absent
from school Mondy. We missed
him from our midst. -
It is stated that air&f Keytes-
ville High School boys will go to
Westminister to school as soon
as they finish here. The reason
is because Mr. Bond" is a gradu
ate of Westminister.

Cottage Burned
Saturday morning about eleven
o'clock while Mrs. Thomas H.
Binford was engaged clearing
away some trash in the yard,
Mrs. Chas. Hirsch who lives ad
joining discovered smoke in her
neighbors cottage and gave the
alarm. It required but a few
minutes for M. W. Anderson to
reach the premises of bis sister-in-law,
but those who preceeded
him were too late to do more
than save a few articles which
they could reach thru, a window.
The origin of the fire is a
mystery. When Mrs. Binford
went to the yard there was no
indication of fire and none about
the house to cause a blaze. The
cottage burned most rapidly and
practically everything it con
tained wa3 consumed, among
other articles a highly prized
diamond ring.
Mrs. Binford prized the home
far above its value because of
its location and because it was to
this that her devoted sons gath
ered each year for a visit to
their mother.
There was $120Q insurance on
the house and contents, much
less than half the cash value. It
is earnestly hoped that the mis
fortune will not deprive the city
of its honored resident nor end
the annual visits of the popular
young men.
