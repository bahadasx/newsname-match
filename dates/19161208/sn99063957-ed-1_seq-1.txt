Retreat Well Conducted.
London, Dee. 8. Fred details of the
(iriniin occupancy of Bucharest receiv
ed today added to the belief here that
the Hiimauitin retirement had been mas
terfully executed and with a minimum
ol' losses.
The Itiimnninn army still is intact,

other cities iu -1 lie territory taken by
the Germans are planning their reor
ganization northward in that part of
Kiiinnuia just below Moldavia. Ruman
ia narrows in this part nnd the flank
of such an army would be well protect

here would be closer to their sources of
Kiipply in Hussia and better able to
draw reinforcements in men from the
czar 's legions.

SEATTLE WOMEN TO FIGHT
Seattle, Wash., Dec. 8. Fdtir
thousand housewives of Seattle
are expected to attend the mass
meeting at the Hippodrome at
2 o'clock this afternoon to out
line a campaign to reduce the
cost ot living.
Members of the dairymen's
association pleaded with tho
women yesterday afternoon at
a conference, not to boycott
butter, saying it would be a
play into the hands of the can-
ned milk concerns, as long as
feed' prices remain high.
Kuibargo measures on all nee-
essities, it was argued would
be the fairest means of rcdue-
iug prices. Manipulation of prie-
es has hurt the farmer and con
sit sumer alike, they argued.
CECILHOTEL BAR
Mirrors Smashed and Fix
. tures Demolished in Seat-
tie's Swell Joint
Seattle, Wash., Dec. 8. Broken glass
and splintered mahogany was all that
i remains of the New I 'ceil hotel bar,
attef a police wrecking squad luid down
their axes at four o'clock this morn
ing. The $40,000 establishment, operated
by John K. Savage in connection with,
his styled "livest dry cafe in Auieri
ta was ordered demolished by May
or (till alter Sergeant of Police Put
nam of the dry squad had convinced
the executive that investigators ex
changed marked money for liquor.
The cafe, connecting with the bar,
was not wrecked.
It was closed down early lust night
when the police prepared to wreck the
bar fixtures, but will continue to run
with its corps of entertainers.
Savage denied booze had been sold
over his bar, but two marked bills were
tumid in the cash register.
The bar was one of the finest in Se
attle, and the restaurant facilities in
the same room wero destroyed with it.
Great plate glass mirrors said to be
among the lnrgest and met expensive
on the const were demolished at a
single blow.
Will Not Be In Line cf Cab
inet Changes, But Chang
ing of Staff
Paris, Pec. 8. Like Kuglntid, France
is preparing a "reconstruction govern
ment". The change w ill not be one of cabinet,
however, but will lie in a new organiza
tion of tho general staff and u concen
tration of tho war's conduct under re
stricted direction.
Tlte "organization," "concentra
tion" nnd "restricted direction"
phrases were those included iu the lan
gunge of a resolution of confidence
ndoptcd by the chamber of deputies last
night, HH to 100. It followed n stormy
secret session. The meeting was the
tenth closed session held recently in
which it is believed the Briniid minis
try came dangerously near dissolution
Last night, it is assumed, the-deputies
found satisfaction in certain promises
of reforms looking to more rigid con
duct of the war made by Briniid and
thereupon registered their support of his
ministry.
A number of deputies nt last night '9
session bitterly assailed "stutiionnry
warfare,' 'and demanded a "speeding
up" on France 'g part.
SHOT CASHIER IN BACK
Point, Texas, Dec. 8. C. A. Glass,
cashier of the First State bank.died to
day from wounds received when a ban
dit 'stood him against the wall of the
bank after robbing the safe Inst night
and fired three shots into his "buck.
Iespitc his wounds Glass crawled on
his knees half a block to the home of
Will Thome, a deputy sheriff, and gave
the alarm. o trace of the bandit could
be found earlv today. He obtaiued

Washington, Dec. 8 Tho government
has T' damaging ovidc-nce'' of a wide
spread, illegal speculation in tho food
marKets of the country, n high official
intimately connected with the. food
prico probe said to tho I'nited Press
today.
This official expressed the belief that
the investigation, so far tends to show
"a gross abuse of the transportation
facilities of the eountry."
It was declared the inquiry so far
tends to show that "certnin interest"
ablo to control to some extent tho move
ments of largo numbers of freight cars
have been acting ' in vicious and ille
gal collusion" to withhold food sup
plies from largo markets, notably at
Chicago.
These charges arc considered deeply
significant in view or the conference
yesterday between George. W. Ander
son, special assistant to the attorney
goucral in charge of the federal food
probe, and Commissioners Meyers and
MeChord of the interstato commerce
commission. Additional significance is
nttacluid to the charge in view of a
statement by the Auiericnu railway as
sociation today that more than 33,000'
treight cars are lietu up at uniengo anu
Detroit awaiting unbinding.
It was stated at tho White House to
day that much evidence wanted by the
administration has be'en laid boforo the
president in the past twenty hours and
that all government branches active in
the campaign have done 'exceptional"
work. Until every investigation is com
pleted, however, the president will for
mulate no plans for remedies. When he
is ready, though, it as declared today,
"ho 111 strike quickly and strike hard,
if striking is necessary."
Tho -high cost of living problem was
to occupy considerable time during this
afternoon's cabinet session. Commerce

Government Gets Bu3y
Washington. Dee. 8. The govern
ment food price probe took definite
shape today.
While official statements regarding
plans for investigation and action in
this sort of work nrc withheld, the Unit
ed Press learned authoritatively that
the department of justice has been giv
en carte blanche in the matter. This
plan is known to have tho complete ap
proval of President Wilson.
The investigations on under tho su
nervision of the agricultural and com-
imoreo departments and by the federal

Think Wreckage
.. Came from the Daisy
Astoria, Or., Dec. 8. Shipping men
today, were inclined to believe that
wreckage which drifted ashore south
of here was from the lost deckload of
the steamer Daisv, rather than evidenco
! that the steam nehooiier Santa Barbara
had been damaged.
The Daisy lost her deckload only a
few miles from Cape Mears, where most
of the debris was sighted. A life pre
server marked "Santa Barbara" float
ed among the rubbish. This gave rise
to tho report that the Santa Karburn
was in trouble.

signs of disa-itor returned here without
having sighted the Santa' P.urbara or

Troops Desert to Join
Bandits
By Webb MiUer.
(United Psess staff correspondent.)
F.1 Taso, Texa9, Doc. 8. With the re
opening of telegraphic communication
between Chihuahua t'ity and the border,
information of massacres and outrages
upon citizens and foreigners in nil parts
of northern Mexico is reaching relatives
and the United States authorities here.
Indications seen in reports to United
States department agents last week
that Villa's attitude toward "griu
goes" and foreigners hnd changed
proved to be misleading and every scrap
of information now reaching the border
points to the fact that the bandit chief
id sparing lives only when it is in his
own interest-
Ynez Salazar, Villa 's chief lieutenant,
saved the million dollar American-owned
Alvarudo mines and also saved the town
of Pnrral from destruction by arguing
that both the mine and the towu would
be useful to Villa when he obtains con
trol of the country.
Authentic information has been ob
tained Oit nt least 1.G00 government
troops deserted and joined Villa during
the attack upon Parra!. .'
On the northward march toward Chi
huahuu City Villistus murdered Will
Snymau, sou of the famous Boer gen
eral, W. D. Snyuiun, at San Pablo De
Moqui, 50 miles south of the northern
capital, according to a telegram to
friends hare, but no details of the mur
der wero reported.
From vnrious sources reports are
reaching government ngents here today
that nn American rancher named Foster
has been slain near Torcron by Villistns.
Department agents obtained a letter
from Torreou received by a Mexican
here stating that Villistui had killed
Foster by burning him at the stake.
After entering Parral, a month ago,
parties of bandits detailed by Villa
searched for Americans in the town
for several days. The bandits knew
the names of all "gringoes," refugees
say, and intended to execute them, .t.
Additional details of the Villista raid
upon Chihuuhua City have reached the
border. Tho homo of Donald tiillis, an
American, was wrecked nnd Howard
Snyder's store looted.
The first passenger train from Clii
liua hua City since the bandit attack
upon the city arrived at the border dur
ing the night. Jose Bnrio, Italian, and
his daughter, who was reported kid
naped, vere passengers.
Apprehension wns aroused here by the
movements of bodies of Aiicrican
troops during the night. General Bell,
commanding, said the movement had no
significance but was merely part of a
preparedness program and to accustom

The killing is said to hnveanccurred

port from an official source to the de
partment iu this case.
Officials said today they classod
overnight reports from tho border which
told of 'the killing of the Americans,
(ray, Foster and Wnyman, with "wild
reports of killings in Chihunhuu City
last week."

Jose Hovio, an Italian refugee from
Chihuahua City, today told United

Minister .
PROSECUTION OF WAR
DESIRE OF ALL PARTIES
New Force Injected Into
Conflict and Great Results
Expected
By Ed L. Keen.
(Tinted Press staff correspondent.)
London, Dec. 8 All doubt that David
I.loyd-Oeorge would have complete eup
port for his new government in parlia
ment was swept away today when the
Liberal party menfbers, iu conference,
formally resolved to support tho new
regime in tho prosecution of the war.
The action means tho new premier
will not only be backed up by the Un
ionists and the Lahorites totalling 324
votes out of the 070 in commons but
also tho Liberal block of votes 200
more. The Irish Nationalist group is
the only one of any strength now re
maining in commons whose position to
ward the new ministry is not yd clear.
The Liberal conference today adopt
ed resolutions of confidence in its lead
er, former Premier Asquith, but de
clared itn determination to support the
new government iu the prosecution of
the war.
About 200 Liberals from both houses
of parliament, including a number of
former ministers, attended the meeting
of the purty, held at noon in the Re
form club. Asquith, smiling and ap
parently happy, was accorded an en
thusiastic ovation by the crowd which
gathered nt the entrance to the club.
. Han Confidence of All.
Former Premier Asquith presided at
tho meeting of the Liberals. He ex
plained in full detail all the circum
stances leading up to the chunge in gov
ernment, particularly defining his own
position in the crisis which led to disso
lution of the coalition cabinet.
The new premier's whirlwind mastery
of the political situation yesterday was
universally taken as indicctivc of his
future general conduct of the adminis
tration in tackling difficult problems,
either foreign or domestic.
Tin' general admiration for Lloyd
George's energy, organizing ability and
gift of conciliation wns expressed by
the Pall Mull Cazette today.
"The success and rapidity with
which Lloyd-Oeorge is fulfilling his
commission," the Gazette asserted, "in
dicntes lie will shortly have on adminis
tration not only witli a strong personal
ity and practical talent, but nrmede
with the nation's confidence. Yester
day's achievement gives a more vivid
impression than anything else of the
striking gifts of leadership which the
new premier possesses."
Loudon does not expect formal an
nouncement of the personnel of the new
ministry until next Tuesday, to which
date the house of "ominous adjourned
vesterday. In the interim Lloyd-George
has plenty of time in which to make
his selections and utilize his gifts as a
conciliator infuser of enthusiasm nnd
orgnuizer.

Word to this effect reached here
from Japan today. A dividend Of 2S
percent was declared November 28.
Members of the imperial Japanese
household own a large percentage of
tho stock.
Labor Is Scarce.
Tokio, Nov. 21. (By mail.) War
timo prosperity has brought to Japan
an actual shortuge of labor and has
given a strong impetus to tho trade
union movement in the empire, accord
ing to observers who have watched the
situation closely.
In the fountry where only a short
timo ago the strongest coolie could be
hired for a few sen a day almost all
industries are s'nding agents through
out the provinces seeking more men.
Not long ago there wns talk of over
population and tho birth statistics
wero used to explain the urgent need
of expansion abroad, but conditions ure
different now. Wages have risen as
tonishingly and with the advancement
in position of tho workmen trade un

The government prohibits organiza

bargaining has come into existence
through the formality -of application
to tho home office.

Germany Openly Flouts the

By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 8. After considera
tion of the Herman "explanations" in
the Arabia case, President' Wilson to

will depend this government's format

I he ctinn taken today, it was ex
plained, will necessarily delay for sev
eral days at least any chanco of final
decision in the mutter.
The Arabia case was to bo thoroughly
discussed at this afternoon's cabinet
meeting.
America's policy toward the Uermnn
submarine situation remains exactly
what it was when this government told
Uermnny she must stop her ruthless
methods o'f torpedoing. This was stated
officially today, but tbiire was reason,
to believe that the United States had
not unalterably put np the gates at least
to brief discussion of serious subma
rine problems now before tho adminis
tration. Taken at its face, the statement that
tho American government stands pat en
her uttitude expressed in the Sussex
notes, menus that she would break dip
lomatic, relations if Germany trans
gressed. There is growing belief that
in the Arabia case, at least, and per
il up. in the Marina, she had overstep
ped America's mandates.
lint in line with a policy or averring
anything that might ultimately lil to
war, the administration is regarded as
likely to steer clear of n break up to the.
lust possible point.
Kxpcrts ln'licve that the Aralim case
presents a situation in which Germany
openly flouts American interpretation
of subninrino rules nnd American rights
in tho matter.
Briefly, Germany admits that her
commander built up a structnre of
presumption thnt the (rabia was a
transport and hence win like,-nnd then
proceeded to sink her. The other ide
of the picture lies in (he American
memnrndnin of March 25. Whilo Hint
