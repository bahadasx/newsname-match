red From Conversing With Outsiders
—Effort to Bribe Jury Hinted At.
[By a Staff Correspondent^
Red Oak, Dec. .8^-Jim Atkinson, the
Stanton farmer whom Mrs. Alice Wil
lard yesterday charged with offering
her financial inducements to
ychango
the testimony she has given for the de
fence, was put on the witness stand
this morning "by the plaintiff and de
nied ever having made any such offer
to Mrs. Willard. Atkinson'# story was
that'Mrs. Wilard had told him Monday
afternoon that the evidence she haa
given was worrying her and wanted to
talk^ with him about it. The automo
bile ^rip to Villisca was arranged for
this purpose, he said. During the ride,
Atkinson declared she asked him for
advice as to what she should do.
"She said'she was sure she knew the
men she testified of having seen," At
kinson declared, "but that^he said she
might be mistaken." It was this that
she said was giving her. concern, he
testified. Atkinson said Mm Willard
told him she did not want Jones to te
convicted on her evidence alone. "There
was absolutely not one word said about
getting money for changing her testi
mony," Atkinson declared. Atkinson
also swore that on last Memorial Day
Mrs. Willard told him she could get
$500 'from Wilkerson for hjr testimony.
Testimony Disputed.
On cross examination -it was brought
out that Atkinson was carrying a sub
poena for the plaintiff since last Mori
day morning. Atkinson had testified
he walked almost to' the depot with
Mrs. Willard Monday evening to take
the train and that t^on her request
had turned back to get au auto for the
trip.
He said he'met Hal' Hkusen, director
in the Jones, bank in VUlisca, within
iwvehty fjset after he left Mrs.^Willard^
and made arrangements with him for
tfaft'.u/MS of his -car. .Hausen Has been
-sitting at the coiinsel table much of
rtfte
time during the trial,' Atkinson
denied he had any arrangements. to
meet Hausen there.
Mrs. 'Willard .was given an hour's
cross examination this* morning but
persistently denied she had made previ
ous arrangements for th^ automobile
trip to Villisca with Atkinson. She also
denied walking to the depot that evens
ing with him but was on the station
platform of the'deipot, while the train
was there and haf tft^fe walked away
with friends.
Thfe slander suit of Senator'" F. F.
JoneB, of Villisca, against J. N. ^Vilker
son which has been replete with evi
dence of a startling nature ever since it
started nearly, four weeks ago, took
what is regarded its most sensational
turn late this afternoon when Mrs.
Alice Willard, a material witness for
the defense, testified that during an
automobile trip she made, from Red
Oak to ViUiaoa with Jim Atkinson last
Monday evening she had been tpld }f
she would go onj the witness stand and
retract what she had already said she
"would be paid for it and taken care of
the dest of my life." Mrs. Wlll^rd tf
the witness. who .swore she saw two
men whom she befl^ved to be Senator
Jones-and W. B. MoCaull talking with
men she thought to be Bill Mansfield
and Harry Whipple on the corner of
the Joe Moore ^vacant lot, the fiei^ur*
day night preceding the murder,
Mrs. "Willard's story is perhaps the
most startling that has been told fro(n
the witness stand during the prepent
t^ial. She said that on Monday eve
ning she had misseu tofc the
which leave Red ffak for Villisca about
6 o'clock, and was waiting in the deppt
for the 9:30 train when Jim Atkinson
told her he was In an automobil^ and
she might ride home with him. Mrs.
Willard .said she got in the car i?e»r
the Evans hotel, just across front the
depot. She said Atkinson tolL her a
Swede from Stinton was driving the
car.

Mrs. Willard responded: "He asked

NEW NOTE ON "SUB"
QUESTION LIKELY
Recent Activities of Undersea Boats
Again Brings Question tf Aoute
Stage—Washington Government to
Stand Squarely On Position Taken
in 8ussex Case—Great Britain Asked
For Status of Liner Arabia.
Washington, Deo. 8.—Official in
formation to the" state department
establishes that the British ship
Marina, sunk by a German BUblflarine,
with loss of six American^, was in no
se*se a transport and was entitled to
'he immunities of a peaceful mer
chantman. Germany has announced
her willingness to make atnends for
destruction in such a case.
Great Britain has been asked by the
slate department for the status of the
P. & O. liner Arabia, sunk by a Ger
man submarine'^- without warning.
Germany In a note yesterday cites
circumstances which sne contends
jufctifled the submarine oommandar in
taking the Arabia for an armed trans
port. The state department infor
mation is that the ship was a pas
senger-carrying liner, not subject to
&tt£L Ck
The next step in the situation will
not be taken until all the information
Ijas been gathered.
New Note Possible.
A new note to Germany on the gen
eral submarine situation seems a pos
sibility as an outcome of the late
activities of the underseas boats.
If decided upon such a note would
be for the purpose of clearing up what
seems to be differences In interpreta
tion of v-hat Germany's pledges In the
Sussex case cover. Secretary Lansing
said today no final course of
had been agreed upon by
Wilson and himself.
Altho the state department has gone
on the principle of deciding each case
separately, on its merits, it was said
today that the number of cases had
rrached such proportions that general
action would" be Justified.' The days
developrittats in the situation were:
Thfe United States asked Great
Brftain -tor info nidation te determine
the status, of the P. & O. liner Arabia,
which a' German submarine .com
mander took for an armed transport.
Official infcjrmation to the state $e'
payment established that. the British
ship Marina, torpedoed with the loss
of six American lives', was in no ^ense
a transport and. was entitled ,to the
immunities -of a-peaceful merchant
man. Jn both cases Germany has ex
pressed a willingness to make amends
if her pledges were broken.
U. S. to Stand Pat.
It was reiterated today- that the
United States stands squarely on the
position it took in the Sussex case.
This, combined with Germany's state
ment that she too holds to the pledges
she gave in that case, leaves officials to
believe there seems to be some differ
ences in interpretation.
A new note, if decided upon, would
qlear this up and make plain beyond
question that the Unlfed States ex
pects all merchant ships shall, not be
destroyed Without warning or havins
crews and passengers removed to
places of safety.
Affidavits on the sinking without
warning of the Italian liner Palermo,
or which the state, department records
snow there were twenty-three Ameri
cans. are being collected as rapidly as
possible. As yet there are no indica
tions that these American lives were
lost, but from information at hand the
case is similar to those of the Marina
and Ardbla.

Argues For Heavy Armarw ry
Japan is building a larger, mora
powerful and swifter battleship than,
any planned by the American navy.
Rear Admiral Badger today told tha
house naval committee,
The Japanese ship, he said, will have'
a main battery of twelve fifteen or
sixteen-inch guns against tvrclvo four
teen inch on American vesels now -i
building and eight sixteen-inch for
ships authorised last year.
Members of the committee qaeBry
tloned the admiral as to the value of
heavy armor for battleships. The of
ficer agreed that an armored battleship
had tha best chance te survive anfk
pointed out that the Brttlsh battleshur**,
Warsprlte had faced the lire «f tha
German fleet In the Jutland fight with
out being sent to the bottom, as wer»
the larger armored cruisers.
The characteristics of battleships
proposed by the general board, Armlral
Badger said, call for twelve stxteon
inch guns, a speed of twenty-«lx knots
and a displacement of 40,009 tons, Th*
tendency abroad, jhe said, was toward
heavier, stronger, 'faster ships and tha
navy must keep abreast of that move
ment.
Admiral Badger and Rear Admiral
Fletcher, also attached to the general
board, agreed that speed in excess of
twenty-three knots was not deolrablu
at any time, as it would Increase the
size of ships without giving any aub«
stantial advantage.
WOMEN ABUSE A8QUITH.
Suffragists- Gather to flail at Former
British Premier.
London. Dec. 8.—A small party of
suffragists lent variety today to the
arrival of a group of liberals at the
Liberal Club to deoide its attitude
toward the Lloyd-George government.
The women greeted the arrival of tha
liberals with the cry "Another "wait
ond see'." They became more aggres
sive when Mr. Asqulth came up and
abusive
terms. When Viscount Grey arrived
the women created such a disturbance
that the police had to escort him into
tbe club.
The crowd, with the exception of
the women, gave the former premier
and his colleagues a hearty reception.
The Reform Club adopted a resolu
tion expressing confidence in Mr. As
qulth and also the determination of tha
organization to support the new gov
ernment In whatever steps it may
take to prosecute the war vigorously.
The Manchester Guardian says that
the report that Premier Moyd-ftenMra"
will attempt an immediate solution of
the Irish question by means of an im
perial conference is not unlikely.
According to the Chronicle, King
George yesterday wrote to former
Premier Asqulth offering him an earl
dom and the order of the garter. It
is understodd that Mr. Asqulth asked
permission to decline both honors.
The Rvenlng News, one of tho
strongest supporters of Premier Lloyd
Goorge. publishes! prominently a pro
test against the suggestion that A. J.
Balfour be appointed foreign secretary
and- Lord Robert Cecil retained as par
liamentary under-aecretary for foreign
affairs. It says:
"The great enthusiasm with which,
the formation of a new government Is
received everywhere is dampened for
the moment by the persistent rumor
on apparently good authority that Mr.
Balfour 1b to go to the foreign office,
with Lord Robert Cfccil. Lord Robert
record is well known. It would he
nothing short of disastrous -for a man
who adopted* a policy leading to the
weakening of our blockade, and. the
feeding of the Germans, to again, be
placed in command."
