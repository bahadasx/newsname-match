i are still on the retreat northeastward
and military commentators for the
most part do not expect a stand to
be made by the Rumanians before the

GERMAN VICTORY;
I
Entente TdjTTF Germany's!
Weakness Ridiculous, Says
Berlin Socialist News
paper. Berlin, Dec. 8, via London, 11:50
a. m. The Socialist newspaper V6r
waerts, in an editorial on the capture
of Bucharest, expresses the view that
the chief significance of the victory
lies in the disproof it furnishes of the
entente assertions that Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg's expressed
willingness to make peace is dictated
by Germany's weakness. The news
paper argues that the present moment
Is especially suited to further effects
for peace as the Teutonic conquests
in Rumania make further entente talk
about Germany's weakness ridiculous.
"The prophets were lied to," con
tinues" the article, "when they were
told that Germany was about to break
down. They were lied to when they
were told that Germany wanted
peace in order to escape sure defeat
and cheat her enemies out of a cer
tain victory."
It asks who can, after Bucharest,
dare interpret German peaco speeches
as "signs of weakness."
Tho article concludes:
"Never has peace been talked loud
er or more passionately in Germany
than during the last few weeks, yet
precisely these weeks have matured
what probably is tho most wonderful
success Germany has achieved during
this war. Foreign governments lack
the courage to make peace. The Ger
man government can and must have
it. It must manifest that courage
until the peoples on the other side
sweep away the governments which
can neither win victories nor conclude
peace. The attempt must be
made and if it fails through the ob
vious fault of others, then we can go
on with a good conscience until the
next time and our soldiers will re
sume their march."

HOLLAND AND
GERMANY AGREE
Plan for Exportation of Food
stuffs Identical With Great
Britain Agreement.
London, Dec. 8, 9:15 a. m. An Am
sterdam dispatch to the Times says
that the Berlin Vossische Zeitung an
nounces that an agreement has been
reached between Holland and Ger
many regarding the exportation of
foodstuffs identical to that existing
between Holland and England. The
Amsterdam correspondent of the Vos
sische Zeitung says that it is really,
if not technically, an agreement be
tween Germany and England whereby
both may obtain food from Holland.
The Times' correspondent interprets
this as meaning that Dutch ships car
rying food to England will not be mo
lested by German submarines or
sdized by destroyers. He adds:
"It is part of a wide agreement,"
and also says that the understanding
with Holland provides for the payment
of foodstuffs by German treasury
notes and bank assignates.

- No limit is set on the duration of

Notice of the embargo was served
on the connecting lines by the two

Ohio, as the fartherest east point of

Vigorously Protested.
London, Dec. 8, 12:05 p. m. The
Evening News, one of the strongest
supporters of Premier Lloyd-George,
publishes prominently a protest
against the suggestion that A. J. Bal
four be appointed foreign secretary
and Lord Robert Cecil retained as
parliamentary under-secretary for for
eign affairs. It says:
"The great enthusiasm with which
the coronation of a new government is
received everywhere is dampened for
the moment by tho persistent rumor,
on apparently good authority, that Mr.
Balfour is to go into foreign office
with Lord Robert Cecil. Lord Rob

well known. It would be nothing
short of disastrous if the man who
persistently adopted a policy leading
to the weakening of our blockade and
the consequent feeding of the Ger

was stated tnat a. j. Jtsauour woum

Washington, Dec. 8. A new note 4.
to Germany on the general submar-
ine situation appears to be among the ,
possibilities which may come out of ll
the latest activities of the undersea iJM
boatB. '1
If decided upon, such a note would 'IH
be for the purpose of clearing up
what appear to be differences of in
terpretation in Washington and Berlin 'H
as to what Germany's pledges ia the ilH
Sussex case covered, especially as to IH
armed ships.
Secretary Lansing said today no ; .
final course of action had been agreed ;
upon by President Wilson and him. i '
General Action Justified. . i
Although the state department has ; j
been going on the principle of decid- 'jH
ing each case separately on its merits, i
it was said today that the number
of cases had reached such proportions ' I
that some general action would be
justified, although it was made clear i
that no'.iing had been determined -j
upon.
The day's development in the situ
ationwere: !' ll
The Unite' States asked Great Brit- j ; -H
ain for information to determine the ;' JH
status of the P. and O. liner Arabia, ; 'H
which a German submarine com
mander took for an armed transport. -Marina

Official Information coming to the
state department established that the , jH
British steamship Marina, torpedoed
I with a loss of six Americans was in i
I no sense a transport and was entitled -H
I to the immunities of a peaceful mer
chantman. In both cases Germany has ex
pressed a willingness to offer amends
if her pledges were broken.
U. S. Stands Squarely.
It was reiterated again today that (
the United States stands squarely on jH
the position It took in the Sussex
case. This, combined with Germany's
statement that she too holds to the
pledges she gave in that case, leads
officials to declare there seems to be ,
some differences in interpretation.
A new note, if it should be decided
to send one, would be to clear this up hH
and make plain beyond question that
the United States expects all mer
chant ships, under international law,
shall not be destroyed without warn
ing, or having crews and passengers
removed to places of safety. j
Affidavits on the sinking without jH
warning of the Italian liner Palermo,
on which state department records
show there were 24 Americans, are ;
being collected as rapidly as possible.
As yet there are no indications that
any American lives were lost, but from
information at hand, the case seems
to parallel closely the Arabia and the
Marina.

Washington, Dec. 8. Official infor
mation to the- state department estab
