Organized Cd-Operation.
Richard R. Price ,a director of the
university extension division of the
University of Minnesota, delivered an
address on "Organized Co-operation.
"Society now operates in groups
and masses and not .by individuals,"
said Mr. Price. "Advancing civili
zation Is now marked by the increase
of co-operation among the various
groups. It is becoming recognized
that team pian, and not individual
play, is the thing. As men co-operate
for a common end, they unite their
their strength and community soli
darity is built up. As a nation we
are still in the stage of local co
operation, when Germany, for in
stance, shows a striking example of
national co-operation.'^
Mr. Price stated that when the
great war is over the United Statesl
will suddenly awake and find that
it is opposed in the pursuit of inter
national trade by nations who have
ceased competition among themselves
in order to be reorganized into great
pools, combinations and syndicates
for securing and controlling foreign
trade.
In regard to team play in Minne
sota, Mr. Price said:
"What are the requisites for the
kind of co-operation we want in
Minnesota? First, the development
of the spirit of unselfishness. If a
man or a team tries to attract at
tention to himself as a star, he will
probably destroy the effectiveness*of
the team play. If a man in a com
munity tries to accomplish things by
and for himself, he not only blocks
community action in the one instance
but also probably makes it impossible
to get united community action on
anything. Men must learn to 'Play
the Game.'
"The same principle holds with
reference to the relations of commu
nity or sectional associations with
each other. For instance, it should
be clearly understood that it is im
possible for one section of this state
to get the advantage over another
section without in the long run hurt
ing the entire state. The rich ag
ricultural southern secction cannot
get along without the mines and
lumber of t\e north. But equally
disastrous would it be for the north
to put anything in the way of ag
ricultural development of other sec
tions The fact should be recognized
that all contribute to the wealth and
prosperity of the state and all are
indispensable. The only healthy
motto is, 'All for one and each for
all.'
Sheep Raisin?.
Mitchell F. Jamar, Jr, general
manager of the woolen mills and fac
tories of A Patrick & Co., of Du
luth, delivered an address on "Sheep
Raising in Northern Minnesota."
Mr Jamar said in part:
"We all know that wool is a
world-wide crop and prices are those
of a world-wide market With the
shortage of wool facing us, and in
creasing prices, never was there a
time than the present when farmers
in Northern Minnesota can best use
their spare time to give what little
attention will be required to a small
flock of sheep
Ready Markets.
"A ready market for wool and
sheep can be had in Duluth as we
ourselves are heavy purchasers of
fleece wool. Our small woolen mill,
which was formerly located at Foss
ton, Minn., has grown now wherein
the fleeces of over 15,000 sheep per
month are required to keep it going
A Patrick & Co. purchase large
quantities of wool each year, stand
ready and willing to pay every farm
er and grower of the Northwest the
full market price for any wool that
they may wteh to send them. There
fore, with an established market and
with the knowledge that others have
handled them to considerable profit,
I look forward to a big increase in
the number of sheep in Northern
Minnesota, and feel that in years to
come this will be no small fraction
of the wealth producing factors of
this section."
Delegates Entertained*
The Bemidji Commercial club en
tertained the delegates at the Grand
theater and at an entertainment in
the club rooms Thursday night. The
program at the club rooms consisted
of music by Burchard's* orchestra,
singing and talks by delegates. E.
H. Denu, president of the Commer
cial club, presided. In the talks by
delegates, Bemidji was praised, hail
ed "Bemidjithe home of the boost-
er." The older delegates were remin
iscent and told of the early days in
this district.
Senator L. H. Nord in his address
told of the Bemidji normal school
and stated that he felt sure Bemidji
would getv the entire appropriation
as requested by the state normal
school board.
Good Roods Praised.
At the meeting Thursday after
noon, Senator J. H. Baldwin dis
cussed good roads) legislation in place
of Senator "Bob" Dunn of Princeton,
who was unable to be present. He
stated that an effort would be made
at the next session of the legislature
to incorporate some of the best feat
ures of the repealed Elwell law into
a law. He estimated the expendi
tures on roads in Minnesota this year
at 110,000,000 and praised the high-

way commission system. He said the
highway commission was good and
that it should not be abolished.
The report of the rural credits
committee, written by L. B. Arnold
of Duluth, was read by Dr. E. Dana
Durand of the state university.
Woman Gives Address.
Mrs. Charles F. Moller, chairman
of the congressional committee of
the Woman's Suffrage association in
Minnesota, gave a talk on "Woman's
Suffrage."
She said in part:
"The women of Northern Minne
sota are ready to share your suc
cesses, your reverses, your joys and
your sorrows. All we ask is an op
portunity to do theste things. Women
do not like to be classed as parasites.
We believe that we can be of as
sistance and that assistance is yours
for the asking." She requested that
the association pass.* a resolution fa
voring woman's suffrage.
John Owens of Cook in an address
on development urged a rural cred
its association in the state, favoring
a loan from the state school funds
or some other available fund, by
which the settler may have the use
of the money at a low rate of in
terest, the same to be used in the
development of his land for his own
use and that of future generations.
"Minnesota is in a better position
to carry a loan plan for the benefit
of the farmer than many other
states," said Mr. Owens. "The state
of Minnesota needs no advice from
Washington, no board to tell it how^
to make its loans to its farmers).
There are competent men within its
borders to do this and it is high
time that the farmer had his propor
tion of state loans with which to de
velop his property."

TWENTY DAYS' SUPPLIES
Germans Preparing for Powerful Of
fensive in Macedonia, Says
Report.
(By United Press)
London, Dec. 8.The disciplining
of Greece by the allies} has begun. A
blockade of the ports of Greece has
been formally announced by the
French government. This, with the
previous British and French orders
against the movement of Grecian ves
sels from the harbor, is expected to
cut the kingdom off from supplies.
Dispatches from Athens said that the
members of an Italian colony are the
only alien citizens remaining. Greece
has enough supplies to last 20 days
against a blockade, it is said.
London, Dec. 8.Details from Ger
many indicate that the Rumanian
government made a masterly evacua
tion of Bucharest with minimum
losses.
Paris, Dec. 8.The French bat
tleship Suffren has been classified as
lost. It was an 18-knot battleship
of 12,750 tons and cost $6,000,000.
London, Dec. 8.The official state
ment says that German troops along
the whole Monastir front are being
strongly reinforced. It is presumed
that these forces are being divested
from the Rumanian theater of war
and it is believed that the Germans
are preparing for the inauguration of
a powerful offensive against the
Franco-Serbian-Italian-British forces
in Macedonia.
The Bemidji Daily Pioneer is anx

J. W. Naugle returned last eve
ning from International Falls and
Baudette where he has been on busi
ness.
Rev. Johanneson of Blackduck was
the guest of Rev. and Mrs, Osmund
Johnson yesterday.
Three big, burly toughs had en
tered the restaurant and not pleased
with the service they were receiving
addressed some insulting remarks to
the girl waitress. Mr. McDonnell
took exception and in a, quiet hut
determined manner made it plain
that he would not countenance any
further talk of that nature.
One word lead to another and a
fight soon started. Now let it be
known that "Paddy" in his palmy
days was decidedly handy with his
fists and has many a hard fought
victory in the roped arena to his
credit. According to the daily paper
which carried the story, Lincoln
wrote it, but five minutes was re
quired to put those three toughs flat
on their backs from well directed
blows from the huge fist of the irate
contractor and they later left the
restaurant, sadder but wiser from
their experience.
McDonnell says that he awoke the
next day to find himself a hero, and
that perfumed letters from the la
dies, communications from clergymen
and laymen alike, commending his ac
tion, poured in on him with amazing
regularity until he was glad to get
out of town long enough to let the'1,and
"hero worship" idea die down.
"If you want any hero worship,
leave it to 'Link,'" he said to the
reporter today. "He would have
made me a millionaire or got me in
jail for life if he had remained in
Duluth much longer."

TIZENS
When broad-shouldered "Paddy"
McDonnell, Duluth contractor, heard
someone of Fred T. Lincoln's many
old-time newspaper acquaintances re
fer to him as "Link" and recall his
days) of service on a Duluth news
paper, "Paddy" cocked his ear in a
listening, attitude "Link, where is
that man?" he asked and in a mo
ment the former newspaper man and
veteran contractor were exchanging:
reminiscences of days in Duluth.
Mr. McDonnell is here in the in
terest of some road work he expects
to make a bid on later and is a guest
at the Markham.
Mr. Lincoln, who is secretary of
the Brainerd Chamber of Commerce,
is in the city attending the N. M. D.
A. meeting.
According to "Paddy," Lincoln is
about the best press agent in exist
ence and he cites a personal incident
to corroborate his statement. One
Sunday morning McDonnell stepped
into a Duluth restaurant for break

ago and in those-4ays the rougher
