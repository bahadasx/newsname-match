Antagonism Thnt Helps.
ITo that wrestles with us strengthens
our nerves and sharpens our sUlll. Our
antagonist is our helper. Durlto.
The Western Liberal is in
receipt of a letter from Mrs.
Robert Strain of Silver City, an
ardent worker in the National
Red Corss, appealing to the peo
ple of this vicinity for Christmas
gifts for our regular soldiers on
the border. Presents or cash
donations will be received by
Mrs. Strain at 10th and Santa
Rita streets, Silver City. Prompt
ness is desired as the boxes are
to go to the border by the 15th
of December.
Lordsburg should not fall down
in this appeal. It is a worthy
call that should be answered.
A nation-wide collection of
Christmas boxes for the 50,000
regular soldiers in Mexico and
along the border has been an
nounced by the American Red
Cross. It is planned to give a
national testimonial of gratitude
for the work done last year by
the regulars who do not have the 1
attention of "the folks at home. "
General Pershing, who was
asked by the Red Cross to indi
cate just how the country could
show its gratitude and interest
during the holiday season to men
so far from their own home sur-1
roundings, replied as follows: !
"Many thanks for kind offer to
contribute Christmas boxes to
troops of this command. Men j
now well supplied with necessar
ies, but I think pipes, packages
tobacco, cigarette papers, cigar
ettes, match boxes, pocket
knives, small cans of jam, stick
candies, writing material, light,
novels and kandkerchiefs would
be suitable."
640 Acre Bill Is
To Come Up Soon

Decombor 4, and one of the first
measures to receive attention
will be the G10 acre homestead.
It almost certain to become a law

This prospective legislation is
of vast importance to stockmen
and ranchmen in many portions
of the West and those who are
not alive to the situation may
find others are ahead in the race
and that the land they have in
view is already covered by an
application.
