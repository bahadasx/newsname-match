1 ' The. automobile motion picture tour
;i,ing party, under the direction of 'A. L.
Westgard, arrived in Flagstaff the
first of the week and have been mak
ing the moat of their time here taking
pictures of all the scenic points In

Mountain, the Walnut Canvon Cliff
Dwellings, Meteor Crater as well as I
beautiful views of our splendid for
ests.
This picture tnking tour will extend
over the entire United States and is
being made with the idea of letting!
the wholo people know and sec Ameri-'
ca and appreciate her, natural beau-j
ties, resources and great industrios.
These pictures will bo shown in every ,

the great American will entail but
, small expense which will be within
the reach of all.
The far reaching effect that will re
sult from this commendable under
taking can not be over estimated. It
will bring the peolpe of the East, the
West, the North and the South into
closer touch and bring about a feeling
that though leagues divide us we are
still one people living in and working
for the advancement of the one great
country.
Father Vabre, the ever boosting
good roadster and old time friend of
Mr. Westgard, accompanied the party
to the Grand Canyon, from which
point they returned Wednesday, re
' porting beautiful weather for photo
graphing and fine roads for traveling.
The party.vcomposed of Mr. and
Mrs. Westgard, the photographers '
and mechanics, has passed through'
northern New Mexico and is now
making northern Arizona, having al
ready covered the Navajo and Apache
reservations.. Canyon de Chelly, the
Petrified Forests and other points.
After making a trip to Tuba and
the Moqui villages the party will con
tinue along the Old Trails Route to
Williams, Kingman and into southern
i California, doubling back through
southern Arizona and on through the
gulf states. This route is laid out &o
that work may progress all winter
and in the spring and summer the
party will cover the northern route.
The following is a resume of-the
work which has been undertaken by
Mr. Westgard:
To make motion pictures of the
whole United States is the job A. L.
Westgard, who has travelled more
miles of roads in an automobile than
any living man, has ;iow set himself.
He is now doing Arizona.
Thousands of reels of film have
been exposed on "scenics" the country
over, hut hitherto no comprehensive
' plan of picturing everything worth
picturing has been followed. Mr.
Westgard, who knows the beauty
spots as no other man knows them,
believes that he can show Americans
things about their own country of
which tbey scarcely dream.
The Pathe Company, which distrib
ute the films, believes so, too, and so
does the Combitone Picture Company,
which is financing the expedition. The
pictures are to be entirely different
.from any hitherto seen because made
by the new Combitone process, in
vented and perfected by F. W. Iloch
stetter, formerly of the Edison staff,
now consulting photo chemist of the
American Photo Chemical Company.
Interior Department Cooperates
The automobile motion picture tour,
which is to extend for more than 25,
000 miles, take more than a year and
includes overy state in the Union, is
madc under the auspices of the Na
tional Highways Assobiation, of which
great organization, Mr. Westgard is
"Director of Transcontinental High
ways, and with tho cooperation of the
Interior Department, which has ar
ranged for Mr. Westgard to take all
the pictures he wants in any and all
government reservations, national
, monuments, national parks and forest
'reserves.
- Starting October 20 from Trinidad,
Colorado, Mr. Westgard will pilot his
two big Paige-Detroit automobiles
southward, staying in the warm coun
tries during the winter months. He
will not only point his lenses at the
'well known scenic beauties, such as
tho Garden of the Gods, Grand Can
yon, Petrified Forest, etc., but upon
thousands of scenes, industries and
natural curiosities that the general
traveling public knows little about.
Having crossed the continent eleven
times in automobiles by every avail
able route and gone north and south
from tho Gulf and Mexican border to
the Canadian line by the same means
moro times than he can count, Mr.
Westgard ja in possession of unique
Information regarding roads, views,
natural wonders and the like to enable
many
scenes never before pictured.
As fust as the half dozen reels it is
planned to expose in each state are
completed they will be sent to New
York, where they will be developed
and printed, and the final selection
made. Only the best, not only fiom
a pictorial but a photographic stand
point, will be selected for the final
ton'ng. Mr. Hochstettcr, who will
personally supervise the work, de
mands perfect photography for his
toning process.
"Know America"
It is planned to begin this series in
picture theatres about the first of the
year, under tho title "Know America,
the Land We Love, An Eye-Lecture
on God's Country." Released at the
rate of one a week by the thirty-five
Pathe branches,, the scenics will at I
uutu uu auun in every eivv uuu iuwii
of any importance in the country. But
although their interest and beauty
will make them valuable features in
ordinary picture shows, their real im
portance lies far bejond the feature
of passing entertainment.
With the war abroad cutting down
foreign travel from thousands of
tourists to exactly none, there has
grown a great desire to "Sec America
First." But "seeing" America is a
possibility to only a few. Every one,
however, who can go to a picture show
will be able to "Know America"
through the Westgard pictures. They
will not only be of educational inter
est when released, but should form a
most valuable and educational picture
library of the beauty and resources of
this country.
It is not Mr. Wcstgard's plan to
confine his work to mere physical
beauty, although he knows and will
picture scenes seldom if ever put on
the screen. But to "Know America"
it is necessary to sec her Indian
tribes, animal life, vegetation, arche
ology, her industries, her resources,
her waters and her mountains, her
railroads and her factories, as well as
her Yosemities and her Crater Lakes,
her Ycllowstones and her Grand Can
yons. Will Picture Prosperity
These pictures wjll be made, and
released, by states, so that a compre
hensive "eye lecture" of each of our
grand political divisions will be the
result of each reel of film. The prin
cipal industries of each state will be
emphasized, whether stock raising or
agriculture, mineral wealth or manu
facturing, scenic beauty or water
power, timber or fisheries, showing
not only the beauty and the interest
but the permanent basis of prosperity
of the country. Many of the pictures
will be taken far off the line of com-
mon travel, opening up new vistas to
those who as yet "Know America" on
ly by railroad train or good roads.
Having so intimate knowledge of
the Nation, because of his dose study
and great familiarity with its roads,
no one is in a better position to make
such a series than the "man of many
miles" as Mr. Westgard hns aptly
been called. Add to his complete
equipment, his knowledge of roads
and localities and his enthusiasm for
this long trip, thc distribution facili
ties of Pathe and the supercolor ef
fects of Mr. Hochstctter's combitone
process and it is easily understood
why picturo authorities are looking
forward to what promises to be the
most unique, as well as tho most
beautiful set of "scenics" ever made.
SUPERVISOR AND MRS. BROWN

Mr. and Mrs. R. T. Brown returned
Monday evening from a trip overland

county which he made to inspect some
stock ranches in the vicinity of Fre
donia. He did not state whether he
intended removing to that country
but said that the farther he got away
from Flagstaff and Williams the more
he loved the people here. On the
other hand, Tom, thc people here will
bo more than glad to have you stay
with them.

Raises Question In Azbill Case
The abstract in the ' rase of the
State of Arizona vs. Willis and Henry
Azbill was filed in the supreme court
of the state Wednesday by Clerk of
the Superior Court Chas. H. Adams.
It is a massive document of some
1400 pages and contains all the testi

Next will come the bill ofexecption
from thc defendants' attorneys wiih
answer from the prosecution, after
which the case will be argued on
points of law either by brief or in

thc case under advisement and render
his decision accordingly. Should the
action of the lower court bo sustained,
will the Azbills hang?

O. II. JOHN LEAVES FOR
NEW HOME IN TEXAS
Agent O. II. John completed his
official duties with the Santa Fc last
Friday and left Saturday for his new
Lhome at Hereford, Texas. Mrs. John
and daughter left Friday and will
visit in Denver before joining Mr.
John at the ranch. '
The departure of Mr. John for his
farm and his entering into the agri
cultural line is the realization of an
ideal cherished for many years, and,
although his going is the loss of. a
good citizen for Flagstaff, all his
friends arc wishing him unbounded
success.
It is his intention to specialize on
hoff raising, rather than crop raising,
and with the present market condi
tions, which are not apt 'to change for
several years, together with his effi
cient management, should make the
venture a paying proposition.

Mr. C. B. Wilson handled the eulo

WM, AIIL INJURED MONDAY
' RUN OVER BY LOG TRAIN
Mr. Ahl, working for the Flagstaff
Lumber Company on a logging train,
was run over Monday afternoon and
probably fatally injured. Two wheels
of a log car passed over his body just
above the hips, crushing" one hip joint
and mangling his body.
While it'docs not seem possible that
a marf can survivo long after going
through such an accident the physi
cians in charge of his case stated
Tuesday that he seemed to be rally

Lowell Will Admitted to Probate
The will of the late Dr. Lowell was
admitted to probate in the Superior
Court Saturday and Mrs. Constance
Lowell was appointed executrix. John
K. McDonald, of Wakefield, Mass.,
was in Flagstaff for the hearing as a
witness to the will.
Every ballot voted in the recent
election in Arizona will be brought to J
Phoenix for inspection in connection
with the contest of the retiring gov-1
ernor, George W. P. Hunt, against
the republican governor-elect, T. E.
Campbell, if Eugene S. Ives, chief
counsel for thc defeated candidate has
his way in the Maricopa county supe
rior court. This, Mr. Ives announced
Monday on his arrival in Phoenix to
take charge of thc legal battle that
will be waged as a result of the close
ly contested gubernatorial fight
It is with the jdea of giving his
republican apponents an opportunity
to sec and pass on every ballot, that
Mr. Ives is intending to call for all
the returns, instead of adhering to the
plan announced by Mr. Hunt some
days ago, when it was said that only
certain counties or precincts would be
questioned.
The bill of particulars to be filed by
the democratic contestant, a copy of
which it is said is in thc hands of
Judge R. E. Sloan, chief counsel for
thc contestee, is to lack particulars.
It is merely to state that it is the
belief of thc contestant that there
have been errors in thc count, and
that an inspection of thc ballots is
asked, in order to supply the basis for
more .detailed or special claims later,
should the contest be allowed to pro
ceed. Under the law, it is necessary for
the contestant to go .considerably into
detail about his complaints.
"We do not and will not allege
frauds," said Judge Ives.
Approched for a statement regard
ing plans of the contestee, Thomas
Maddock, republican state chairman
said:
"We do not know when or how the
contest will take place.
"We are on the defensive, and will
resist when thc attack shows what
they have been planning for the last
three weeks, since the election of
Campbell has been assured. We have,
of course, been gathering information,
but are handicaped by the paucity of
republican members who acted on tho
election, boards or who were in charge
of thc supervisioral count

to place watchmen on guard. Neither
are we afraid of the rulings of the
courts, however partisian their make
up. X.
"We had hoped that when the peo
ple's verdict was clear that our work
would be finished and are especially
surprised that one who has been so
much against the courts should resort
to them for salvation against thc peo
ple. "There may be some question
whether or not the democratic state
committee is behind Mr. Hunt's con
test, as the chairman has been quoted
as saying he was opposed toit, but
one thing is certain, and that is thc
republican state committee, the party
and the best elements of the state of
Arizona are behind Tom Campbell to
a man."
Just how Attorney Ives expects to
get an order from the Superior court
!pf Maricopa county for the .delivery
of all ballots to thc state capitol is
not known, neither is the procedure
prescribed in our celebrated statutes.
It is generally believed that such a
thing could not be done short of an
order from the Supreme court and in
that event how will thc case get into
the supreme court without passing
tie Superior court and upon appeal
of thc contest?
However, at the instance of Attor-
nev fipneral Wilev Jones, the ballot

opened by the Coconino county board opportunity to display all her wondcr
of supervisors and the ballots counted. f jl dramatic skill. The regular prices
Where did he get his authority for wiu Prevail. a
such an act? Perhaps Ives got his
idea for taking all the ballots to
Phoenix from the famous Jones Anno
tated Statutes and it is quite likely he
will get by with it and and save Mr.
Hunt or thc parties paying for the
contest heaps of money. This prob
ably accounts for the "we want a re
count just to see if the official count
was rcaly correct, don't .you V atti
tude assumed by the contestants.
Another question which is raised by
the contest is "will Campbell be gov
ernor January 1st should thc contest
not be finished by that date?" Un
less Secretary Osborn is restrained
from jssuing a certificate of election
to Campbell, he will certainly take
charge with the beginning of the new
year.
A rumor was prevalent in Flagstaff
Wednesday that Governor Hunt ex
pected to gain 300 votes In, Cochise
county alone on a recount of the bal-
. J-',!.- .C'-J ."-.- f' - fL , ' iJ.1j
lots, but in view of the fact that it
would be imposible to resurrect that
many ballots not shown of thc official
count, the report is not credited.
Just what' the contestants will try
to show in regard to the conduct of
thc election and the counting of the
ballots is not known but it is supposed
that the big fight will come up over
counting tickets marked straight dem
ocratic and scratched for Campbell.
Contests Becoming Popular
Lorum Pratt Starts His Suit
Suit was filed in the Superior court
Thursday morning by Lorum Pratt,
Jr., plaintiff and contestant vs. F. S.
Brown, defendant and contestee, in
which Pratt claims lo have been duly
elected Justice of the Peace of Fre
donia, precinct.
The canvass of the election board
gave Pratt 33 vots and Brown 33
Votes, but notwithstanding this fact
thc plaintiff alleges that one vote cast
for Brown was illegal and should not
be counted.
The complaint states that Robert A.
Lane, who's vote was cast for Brown
was not a resident of Fredonia pre
cinct, that he was a resident and was
registered in Flagstaff precinct No. 3
and voted at Fredonia, upon a certi
ficate of registration issued by the
county recorder of Coconino county
on the ICth day of August.
In case the count remains the same
after the contest it will be decided by
lot who shall hold the office. Pratt is
the republican candidate and Brown
thc democrat.

Caterpiller Starts lis Crawl
The big caterpiller truck started
out from Flagstaff Thursday after
noon with a drag of four trailers, all
of which were loaded to capacity.
This is the first trip for the caterpiller
to thc White Mesa property of the
Navajo Copper Co. and it may not be
