"The Chamber notes the declarations

New British Defence Against U-Boats
May Bar Allies' Ships from U. S.
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER
! By Cal'le to Th.? Tribune.!
London, Dec. 7.?In th?1 effort to suppress the sub?
marine menace, I hear, many British merchant ships are
heilig armed with j/uns of high calibre, so that the odds
against them shall be lessened. In this connection it is r?1
called that the ?limitation for sterner war measures that led
to the downfall of the Asquith ministry ?ailed for adequate
measures to curb the U-boats.
If the American government holds that the increased
armament puts merchant ships in the class ?if war vessel.*?
Halifax will become the chief American port for trans?
atlantic shipping during the war. Britain is able to use
her fleet to keep this port clear. ?Such a change is bound to
have a big effect on the port of New York.
The arming of merchant ships is a difficult problem,
since the mounting of big guns means alterations in struct?
ure, figures show that only one out of five victims of
submarines is an armed ship.
"The Liverpool Kxpress'* reports that the government
may assume control of all shipping concerns. It is said
that Lloyd (ieorge in his conference with the labor leaders
to-dav promised such government control.

BERLIN EVADES
ARABIA BL?ME
Admits Sinking Ship
Unwarned, but Holds
It Was Transport
; I'rom tin Tribune Bantu 1
Washington, Dec. 7. Germany's ex?
planation of the sinking of the P. ?nd
0. liner Arabia, torpedoed November 8
with one American on board, xvas re?
ceived ?t the Sute Department to-day,
and practically convinced official?, that
Germany's pledges of ?even months
ago have gone by the board.
Secretary Lonaittg made the com?
munication public and then announced
that official comment would be with?
held. From authoritative sources it
was learned that the situation lias
taken a grave turn by reason of this
note, but that the Administration has
not determined its action.
Germany admits sinking the Arabia
without warning, alleging as an excuse
that she xvas out of the norm?l trade
routes und in the lane?, used by trans?
ports; that she was painted black
instead of gray, like the other P. and
0. boats, and that a view of persons
on board in Oriental costumes con
vinced the commander of the ?ub
marine that ?he wa? transporting
"workmen soldier-."
No women or children .xere ob
served, the note says, adding that if
the United State.?, should prove that
the vessel was not a transport the act
would be disavowed. Berlin assure?
the United States that the pledge
given in the Sussex ca-e still stands -
that peaceful merchant ?hips will not
be sunk without warning and without
?riving those aboard a chance of safe
removal.
"Discretion" Rule Indicated
Hut in informed quarters the note is
regarded a? a confession that German
commanders are not instructed to com?
ply with the rule of visit and search,
as the United States has demanded,
but that they are permitted \o take
chances when they believe they are
dealing with a combatant ship.
The fact that no Americans wer?
killed, however, is being taken into '
consideration. It is improbable, from
.nilicationa given to-dav, that th?:
Arabia case in itself will form th?.
basis for ? break in relations with
Germany, even though on the face of
fo-d?y'? confession the uledsres of last
>lav have beer, v.olated wantonly.
But the information concerning Ger?
many's method of x?arfare that is re?
vealed in the note undoubtedly will !
prejudice the State Department m deal- '
.ng with the Merina case, in which ?ix
Anier.cans were killed, ?iemanj's ex?
cuse la that case xv?s ?imiiar the
commander thought he was dealing
with a transport. ( oupied with the
Arabia confession, however, it will be
difficult, officials believe, for the State
Department to agree that the Manna
attack was ? bona tide mistake.
Wilton to Give Gemunx ? hanre
As pointed out in The Tribune
previous!;. President Wilson will not
with Germany on a mere tech
nieality. He la determined to give tier
many ?very chance to prove her good
f?itn. ?r.d. ?Ithoutrh he served notice in

end the situation in Greece.
A blockade of (?reek ?jorts will be

le?stablishment of Allied control of
the police, mails, telegraphs, rail
vays, ports, customs and passports.
It was asserted in Athens govern?
ment circles that Greece could with?
stand a siege for twenty ?lays, al?
though districts that could be reached
only by water would suffer mor.
quickly, according lo these dis?
patches.
