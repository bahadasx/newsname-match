This is so true that it needs no proof to bear it eat. The

cheapened to make a price, and none of which can be judged

In many different grades. Your all silk socks can be made^at of
pure, earth-grown fiber without your knowing it; nnfl one
is now trying to make them entirely out of cheap glue. ,
Now, the question is, if you are starting out to bu y mm*
thing today, where shall you go? ^
The answer is very simple: If you do not know th* IMPÇfcll
dise, you must know the merchant. The way to judge thejgpds is
to judge the man. And the best way to judge th* man » thtwah
the advertising. ,
The man who advertises is the man who «tf»« his M|ae to
what he claims. If he signs his name to a bogus cbffk , hg-goce
into jail; if he signs his name to bogus advertising he gm* into
bankruptcy. Every advertiser knows this, and so he is ca&fal of
what he says. But the men who do not advertise do noL'kave
anything to lose. They do not have to be so careful of whajthe*
say. It is merely a matter of personal integrity with them.
There are many thousands of fine merchants and honest men who
do not advertise. That is not the point. The question is how to
find them and how to tell them from the rest. When they adver
tise they must be honest if they hope to win.
And this is the value of the Advertising Pages in this papei
today. These are the men who have signed their names. These
are the men who guarantee what they sell.
It has been nearly three-quarters of a century ago since the
first great merchant, Alexander T. Stewart, trusted his commer
cial ship on the advertising sea. And singularly enough thi«
great man was flying flags of distress when he advertised. He put
out a little dodger through the streets of New York, telling the
people frankly that he had bought too much and would sell it
cheap. And they came to his store and saved his life.
Any man is careless who doesn't turn to the advertising news
for whatever he is going to buy, because the best merchants are
always the ones who advertise. They are the men who stand
hack of what they do and say. They are the guaranty of good
faith in the business world.
Turn to their advertising pages now and ses what tfcsy aw
offering you today. .. v ;

will be the finest hostelry m
this part of the state, Mr
Halvorson states.
The present Metropolian
hotel is considered one of th«
best in northern Montana.
When it was erected, about
six years ago, local citizens
and the traveling publifc
wondered if a hotel of sqjch
magnitude and class wouH
pay in Cut Bank. Here is a
little sermon against doing
things by halves—in a town
of the promise of Cut Bsjgk
The Metropolitan was Ida
big for the town only foc .a
short time. Now it is fat; too
small and a hotel of city pre
tention is justified in the
judgment of the owners.
H m Won Recognition
Will A. Campbell, of the Helena
Independent, in an interview in the
ftatte miner, said that common
newspaper print paper would reach
the extremely high prioeof lOoenta
per pound before the first of April.
Mr. Campbell haa juat returned
from eastern and Canadian paper
mille, and he aays;
"There will be hundreds of papers
throughout the country forced to
cease bneineee, and I can't aee how
the Montana dailies can continue
without advancing their advertising
and their subscription rates."
Mr. Campbell goes on to say that
Montana, through its balloting, has
won nation-wide recognition and
fame, this state being the first to
report its presidential vote. Jeanette
Rankin'a election did just aa much
to throw thia state iuto the lime
light.
Tom Tells Thia
Conrad Independent: An unusual
oconrrenoe is reported from the
Curtia ranch, eight-miles east of
Conrad, where two blacktail deer
have been killed buring the past
week.
The first deer wae killed by Tom
Doncan last Saturday, and the sec
ond by Mr. Curtis yesterday.
Deer of any kind are aeldom seen
on the prairie this far from the
monataie« nad it is especially out
of the ordinary for a blacktail to
get thia fer from the hills. In fact
not even the old timers ever recall
having aeen a deer ef this kind
thie locality before.
Ii ie thought the many fields of

New Grain Law
Has Big Benefits
Federal Grain Inspection is
Welcomed By The
. Farmers
Montana is one of the states
that will be vitally affected by
the United States grain standard
law, which the government is
now preparing to put. into effect.
Under the authority of the
act. passed by congress on Aug.
11.1916. the United States de
partment of agriculture is engag
ed in formulating grain stand
ards for the northwestern states
which will become authorita
tive for this region with regard
to all grainsün interstate ship
ments and which when estab
lished and in operation under
competent inspectors, are ex
pected to settle the longstanding
difficulties between the buyers
and sellers of commercial grains
as to the proper grading of the
product
The grain farmers of Montana
and other states for years have
been convinced that thev were
defrauded by the undergrading
of their wheat and other grains
at St. Paul, Minneapolis and
other grain-buying centers, and
this law is expected to end this
complaint by establishing fair
grading and fair treatment of
the farmers by the great eleva
tor companies and other buyers.
No iiidj^tria^U controversies
have heervr more bitter in re
cent years than those between
farmers of the great grain
growing states and the buyers
at the great grain terminal mar
kets. Even within the last few
months complaints have been
made that immense frauds
are practiced by the great ele
vator and warehouse interests.
It has been charged that the
buyers made immense profits
by purchasing great quantities
of grain that they insisted was
low grade and subsequently
mixing it with high grade
grain, and then selling the
whole as high grade grain.
Under the new law inspec
tors will be located at all points
in the state where needed. They
will have to qualify under the
federal law, but will be ap
pointed and paid by the state.
Under the new system when
the grain has been graded and
the grade duly made known
by a properly licensed inspec
tor at thè place of production,
that grade will hold for that
grain at the terminals, unless
an appeal in proper form, some
error or fraud is clearly made
out. Disputes between buyer
and seller will thus in most
cases be prevented, and when
they arise an orderly method of
settlement is provided.
