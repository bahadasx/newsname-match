ACON BEACON
THE
68th YEAR
MACON, MISSISSIPPI, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8. 1916..
NUMBER a
FROM THE PEOFLE
Mra. Barclay's Entertainment
Editor of The Beacon:
I had the great pleasure last night
of attending the Cantata given under
the direction of Mrs. L'Estelle Barclay
with forty of Macon's most (talented
children, assisted by Mrs. McMillin a
Grandma, Miss Callaway Kirby a
Queen of the Fairies, Dr. Barclay as
Uncle Sam and Oliver Scales as Itage.'
The children certainly did great credit
ta the traing of Mrs. Barclay and these
able assistants, for I do not think their
orting could have been excelled by any
amateurs, and I was certainly proud of
"our children,"
In telling of this Cantata I cannot do
better than to publish the synopsis,
which I give below :
"Owing to early blizzards reported
from the North Pole Santa Claus has
previously announced his coming at an
early date. Those blizzards continue
with suc'i furv. however that a mes
sage comes from Santa Claus convey
ing the direful news that all sorts of
trouble make it very probable that this
year's visit will not occur at all, tie
appoints his little friends who love him
to do his work for him. Even the most
selfish ones are finally won over by the
general Christmas spirit prevailing and
the lesson of the .ioy or living is por
trayed in beautiful catchv choruses-
bright, breezy lines. But after all
Santa Claus manages to arrive at the
last moment and makes the happiness
complete. Instead of the usual good'
niirht song which closes all cantatas, a
medley of the most tuneful choruses
are given for Santa s benent. Before
the curtain drops on Santa opening his
pack for the happiest children in Ala
con." '
This was original of Mrs. Barclay and
was a splendid theme, very entertain
ing and, as it should, carried a good
lesson to the children, to be unselfish
and that the only happiness in this
world is gotten by making others hap-
py-
All were excellently drilled and knew
their parts well, in spite of the fact
that Mrs, Barclay never had a full re
hearsal, and. while' we will say that she
most excellent material to work on,
still we know that it must take a great
diul of time and patience and execu
tive ability to have carried this perfor
mance through so successfully. She
was very fortunate in her assistants
a;id I am sure that Prof. McMillin will
be proud is his good wife is half as
good looking when she reaches the ape
that she portrayed laBt night.'
Miss Kirby was bewitching as Queen
of Fairies and I am sorry I havn't a
grandson to make her kin to me.
Dr. Barclay, as Uncle Sam was in
comparable and acted his part ho well
and looked so much better than he usu
ally does that I am going to tell Mrs.
Barclay to always keep him fixed up as
Uncle Sam.
Little Oliver Scales acted his part so
well as Page and Sentry that I am sure
if Howard should ever be called on, in
case of a scrap with Mexico, and do
half as well down there as Little Oliver
did last night he will come back a Brig
adier General.
1 would like to mention each one of
the children who took part in the play
but I know I would get into deep water
a3 this would be about as dangerous as
being judge at a baby show. I remem
ber well that one time my old friend
Dr. Gresham was asked to act in thjs
capacity at one ot our county fairs and
he was never able to come to Macon
again. I can only say that I was proud
of the whole set and I told Will that
while the delta beat us in land, noplace
could beat Macon in children and I am
glad that while oiher crops may fail,
the baby crop always comes in due
time. In spite of the boll weevil I know
that will be like the "hill billy" when
tie delta man asked him what he raised
in the hills, he said "children is our
principlest crap" and I hope this crop
will never fail.
When little sister (Anne LouiseDent j
found that she was singing another's
part, stopped and said, "Oh, I'm sing
ing Pearles. " She said it in her inimita
ble and child-like way;and this brought
the house down; at the same time I
saw that she had forgotten to have the
dentist replace her front teeth.
Dr. and Mrs. Barclay are so talented
a 'id always willing to use their talents
for any beneficient cause, that Macon
and Noxubee are certainly to be con
gratulated on having this worthy cou
ple to cast their lot with us.
As this was given for the Ladies' Mis
si unury Society of the Baptist church,
I am very sorry that the admission
was only 15c and 25c, for I am sure
that Mrs. Darclay and her assistants
dseryed a greet renumeration for this
w irthy cause that they received last
nlht, thj being the only small thing
uhnnl. th whole performance.
I must add thatfl 'thought Uncle Sam
, L- n. ... ., , . . .
ana ms nag pa-ce ueserveu epeciai j
mention, and any one seeing h?w these j
'Confederate children waved the old
flag that wc older boys once shot at, 1
am sure that they could not help be
lieving that the South was at last re
constructed and we were once mors a
part of this Union.
Youra truly,
Big Bod.
Report to Conference
To the Officials, Members and ,Friends
of the Methodist Conference:
Kindly permit me to thank you for
your most effective service, fine co
operation and splendid loyalty during
the conference year just closed. It is
with more than ordinary pleasure that
we return to you for the year 1917.
By means of this loyalty and co-oper
ation, God helping us, a splendid year's
work has been done. We are filled
with pride for the past, of course, as
any people should be proud of a worthy
past, but still these achievements only
teach us how to meet the future and
succeed in all things God would have
us do.
Our aim should be to grow in God's
favor. Our work should be to do God's
will. Our success should be manifest
by the fruirs of God's spirit, which
worketh in us day by day teaching us
to be courteous and kind, trusting and
hopeful, long suffering and diligent.
Facing the future, we are humbled ;
before the great responsibility. To
care for the vouncr. to sustain me
weak, to save the sinner is our heaven
imposed dny. He who shirks is a
traitor, both to God and man, so, by
God's crace. we will be faithful and
fight God's battles to a successful
issue.
The report of the year's work is your
report and one of which we all should
eel justly proud; I therefore, render
it to you as it went to the confereuce
at Winona:

The high cost of living is ho?r be
coming a serious problem with us
and noticing the following paragraph
in a paper a few days ago mad me think
of giving two inexpensive, yet whole
some and very nutritious recipes which
may be easily cooietf in the hotne-madi
tireless cooker;
"The humble baked betftfmav soon
be a delicacy served on the fable of
the munition millionaire and hfpak
smothered in onions may be nothing
but a fragrant memory."
RECIPES
Boston Baked Beans Pick over one
quart of pea beans, cover with'cold wa
ter and soak over night. Drain, cover
with fiesh water and heat siowly to
boiling point, drain again, then add
three-fourth nound fat ftalt pork cat in
one inch slices, using rind of pork also.
Mix one tablespoon salt, one tablespoon
molasses and three tablespoons sugar
and enoueh more boiling water to cover
beans. Cover bean pot, place in cooker
and leave for eight hours.
The fine reputation which Boston
Baked Beans have gained has been at
tributed to the earthen bean pot in
which they are supposed to be cooked,
Equally good beans have often been
eaten where a five pound lard pail was
substituted for the bean-pot. Yellow
eyed beans are very good when baked,
Brown Bread One cup corn meal, one
cun Graham flour, one cuo rve meal or
j Pcttijohn flour, three-fourths table
spoon, soda, one teaspoon salt, tnree
fnyrtris rnp molasses; 2 cups sour .milk.

Notice to Teachers
The rural schools of the county will
be closed for the Christmas holidays
from Friday afternoon of December 22
to Monday, January 1. I trust that
the holiday season may be full of hap
piness and good cheer for every child
and tnaehaf in the county, and that we
may all get back to our work after it
is. over with renewed energy and with
new resolutions for a greater year's
work than ever. We shall 1 find our
selves prepared for new and better
work if we allow ourselves to be filled
with the true Christmas, the spirit of
joy and good cheer, the spirit of giving.
Yours for a merry Chrismas,
James G. Chandler,
Cou.'.ty Superintendent.
Death of W. M. King, Sr.
The lemains of W. M. King, Sr.,
aged 02 years, who died Friday morn
ing after a week's illness at the home
of Mrs. Lee White, 2918 Avenue E,
Ensley, were taken to Macon.. Miss..
Saturday morning for interment in the
family burial ground. Mr. King- was
born in Linden, Ala., but his parents
moved to Mississippi when he was nine
years old. tie married Miss Katie
Faser of Macon, Miss. They came to
Birmingham about 15 years ago and
during that time Mr. King has held an
important position with the Tennessee
Coal. Iron and Railroad Company. He
is survived by his widow, two children,
William M. King, Jr., and Mrs. T. A.
Fletcher of Wauchula, Fla., and two
grandchildren. Mr. King was a mem
ber of the Methodist church and several
fraternal organizations. His death is
mourned by a wide circle of friends.
Birmingham Age-Herald.
To the people of Macon Mr. King
was not a stranger. For a number of
years he lived there and was intimately
associated with all the business inter
ests. He married Mias Katherine Faser
there December 21, 1876, and to them
were born three children, one dying at
the tender age of four years.
When his death is spoken of as an
untimely one, several explanations can
be given. First, Mr. King was just a
b'ttlo beyond middle life; then his ill
ness was of Btteh Bhort duration for
one so active, and,(j)o, that'' "his fami
ly, relatives and jfriends were so un
prepared to giveim up.
Alter ms. death friciay morning.
Nov. 24, his. body '.was carried to an
undertaking parlor where hundreds of
his friends viewed his remains. The
beautiful floral offerings sent by friends
from the steel platit and from all over
the city of Birmingham, were indica
tive of great love and respect.
To the l'jved ones who remain, there
is a consolation in knowing that they
will see him again..

The State Department at Wash
ington has recently refused a pass
port to a joung American who
had leturned Co ihe United States
after lighting in the tanks of the
Allies liSfronnd for refusal is
that the young man had forfeited
his Ameriian citizenship when he
enlisted under an alien flag. There
is ample precedent for the ruling,
but it indicates an annoying sit
uation for hundreds of young
Americans when the war is over.
If they wish to renew their Amer

to be naturalized.
