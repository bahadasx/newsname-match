"Million-Dollar Idea" of
Star Stirs 'Em to Action
Representative Victor Zednick, of the 43rd district, will intro
duce a bill in the house at the coming session of the legislature
to appropriate $100,000 to advertise this state in the East, he said
Friday.
Senator Dan Landon, of the 32nd district, and Senator E. G.
Steiner, of the 46th district, will probably do the same in the
senate, they said.
Representative Robert Grate, of the 46th district, will prob
ably introduce a bill to permit cities and counties to appropriate
publicity funds in amounts equal to sums contributed by the com- •
mercial bodies in the various communities.
Representative Paul Houser, of the 41st district, favors an ap
propriation of $100,000, provided the money is spent for the kind
of publicity suggested by The Star's "million dollar" idea.

factories thrnout the Culled States
had agreed not to sell any more of
their product for 30 days, on nc
count of a scarcity of iugredieuts.

) The (ouriat rate victory, follow
ing the campaign made by Th<>
Star haa fired the legislators with
tbe rlirtit kind of "pep" to mak*
good un of tbe advantages thla
state baa to attract Kasternara.
While publicity In the past failed
to show the big result* expected,
the failure was due to the fart that
It cost the tourists more money at
the very outset to come to the Coast
via the Northwest tban via South
ern California.
With this handicap removed,
members of the legislature are
ready to appropriate a publicity
fund as one of the best investments
the state could make.
The "million dollar" Idea Is
spreading like wildfire. Besides
Houser. Mayor Gill and a number
of business men favor the pub
licity along lines outlined by The
Star

That (he legislature will provide
a publicity fund seems certain.
(Juy Kelly, of Tacoma, one of the
candidates for speaker, is enthus
iastic for it.
Many Favor Fund
The following King county mem
bers. interviewed by The Star to
day. favor a publicity fund appro
priation :
Senators I-nmlon, Wray, Stelner
and Mavis, and Representatives
Zednick, Houser. Grass. Knjpp,
Hastings and Hull.
WHAT IT MEANS
The Southern Pacific railway
has announced thai it has
hooked 30,000 tourists for Cal
ifornia this winter.
California statistics show
that the average tourist spends
$200, aside from transportation.
This would give California $•>.-
000,000 of tourist money this
winter.
And the Nortlnvest can be the
summer Mecca of tourists Jusi
br California is now the winter
attraction.
Senators Taylor and Palmer
wanted to "think It over." Repre
sentatives Moss and Renick nlsc
wanted a little more time for re
flection.
The other members of the leg
ißlature could not be reached.
From Taci ma comes word that
Guy K. Kelly, one of the candidates
lor the legislature, is also strongly
in favor of a publicity appropria
tion.
"The secretary of state has made
the usual recommendation of ap
propriating $50,000," said Kelly. "1
atn In favor of It. and believe it will
pass. Whether the money should
be placed In a joint f md with Ore
goti and Rrltish Columbia for gen
eral North west publicity depends,
of course, on what each of the
states does."
Zednick Introduced a bill in 1911
to appropriate $100,000 for publicity
purposes, but this was reduced to
$1'5,000. No appropriation lias
been made since.
Representative Grass introduced
a similar hill to the one he now pro
poses in the 1913 session, but it did
not pass.
Representative Hull will take up
this question at a meeting of the
King county legislators to l> ■ held
next Tuesday.
The delegation from this county
may act .is a unit on this proposi
tion.
