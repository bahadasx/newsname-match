Sunday School Influence.
In the year of 1855 a' repre
sentative of the American Sunday
School Union organized the Big
Creek Sunday School. .This
school is located' manvmiles'from
the railroad and has continued to
meet regularly except for a short
time during the Civil War.
From this little Sunday School
in the backwoods there have gone
forth; seven ministers, one mis
sionary of the American; Sunday
School Union, one Lieut Gov., of
Kentucky, one candidate for
Vice Pres. of the U. S., seventy
school teachers, thirteen merch
ants, ten lawyers and thirteen
practicing physicians. -
Many noted men and women
have gotten ""the inspiration for
their life's work in the country
Sunday School. The country
Sunday Schools.are making noble
contributions to Church and
State.

A Dtiuer tmr the Poor.
On Thanksgiving day Mr. and
Mrs. Walter T. Cody set a dinner
to the poor children of this city
without regard to sect or color,
and when, the dinner had been
spread and all was ready, it was
pleasing to see the little ones fire
on the breast works of Turkey
and to coax it down with rich
dressing and coffee that Mrs.
Cody had prepared. There were
twelve white and eleven colored
children whtf partook of the feast
and after they had .eaten all they
cared to each one was .furnished
a lunch to tike hoaewith them.
Mr. Cody undertse)Mo mike up
subscription for tW purpese, but
the citizens did not respond very
readily, so be went on and gave
the dinner on hi own resources.

The Tuesday Club.

highly entertained at their last
meeting with Mrs. Hugh M.

room in which the meeting was
held was artistically decorated
potted plants and the season's
colors, brown and gold.
The president presided. At
the1- conclusion of the business
routine the leader for the day
took charge of the program. For
lack of time two numbers on
previous program were' deferred
until this meeting. At first it
was tnougnt tne atternoon pro
gram would be a little congested
but the numbers given by Mrs.
Flem D. Satnp9on and Mrs. S. A.
Smith were so well prepared and
interesting that the ladies were
glad we had reserved the treat.
One of our members, Mrs. O. R.
Franklin, who has been quite ill,
is convalescing and we hope to
nave her present at our next
regular meeting.
The program occupied
hours and is as follows:

In anticipation of the comple
tion to this point within a fort
night of the C. & M. railroad
quite a noticeable re-awjkening
in several long dormant or par
tially dormant interests has be-
l gun in the extensive and highly
productive field of which Man
chester, Clay County is the cen
ter. Among other activities it is
reliably reported that tha salt
manufactories, suspended by or
der of military authority during
the Civil War, when cannon balls
were dropped into the wells, will
be opeaed again for the first
time by local and outside capital
ists in the near future. It is
said the salt industry at Man
chester once made it the best
known town in the Kentucky'
highlands, and the place of resi
dence of many former aistingush
ed and sterling citizens of the
state. In addition to the awakening
of material forces, a manifest
renewal of religious and educa
tional influence has been begun,
evidently to continue. Last week
a series of highly successful
meetings under auspices of the
Presbyterian church were con
cluded here, and the present
week another series of evening
services has been begun under
Baptist auspices. Rev. Dr. Wal
ters, of Corbin, and Dr. Roach,
former missionary to oriental
countries, conducting the exer
cises in conjunction. G. B. L.
