AFTER ELECTION INVENTORY
(Grangeville Free Press)
The Free Press this week repro
duces an editorial from the Caldwell
Tribune, which is ably written. The
Tribune is Republican in beliefs and in
preference but it is just to state that
its Republicanism is not mercinary or
narrow but it is of a type that is not
dangerous to public welfare, if the
same viewpoint can not be maintained
as to a large number of Republican
newspapers.
The editorial presents some views
that should be of interest to the
readers, irrespective of political be
liefs, and presents some thoughts
which may later require the voter to
express his own personal convictions.
Reference is not made to the opinion
of the Tribune editor where he en
deavors to guage party sentiment in
Idaho, for it is our belief that results
in the 1916 election in the state could
not be attributed to the dictates of
mere partisan preference or sentiment
alone, but see their origin to a great
extent in the declarations of the ever
growing list of independent voters,
who scan the man and forget the party
when they vote.
Nor can we agree with the statement
of the editorial that "the causes of
disintegration is not that the party
(Republican) stands for obsoltete or
factitious policies of government;"
"that the party did not become cor
rupt," and that "to accuse the party
of corruption is to indict the entire
population of the state," for no party
can rise higher than the elements or
the individuals who direct its policies
and the Republican party in Idaho has
felt the evil hand of bad direction and
influence, and efforts of those in the
party favoring reform was met by op
position well directed and victorious
in its will.
These things may be passed and it
may be recognized that as stated that
the minority party may so ekercise
its power that wellbeing results to the
people. Attention is directed to the
discussion in the editorial of the
primary and the editor of the Tribune
has narrowed his discussion down to
the point where he practically asserts
that the primary system has disinte
grated the Republican organization
and warns the Democratic party that
if it is not repealed that it will work
the same disaster to the Democratic
organization.
There is ground for difference of
opinion here. The primary is not
satisfactory, in fact is very unsatisfac
tory. It is not, however, the fruit
of all evil. True it overcomes party

GREAT AMERICAN SINGER '
SOLOIST GLEE CLUB CONCERT
believed that her appearance will prove
Next Monday evening, December
11th, at the Presbyterian church, the
annual concert by the Girl's Glee Club
College of Idaho, will be given with a
superlative attraction in the noted
dramatic soprano, Sibyl Sammis-Mac
Dermid. Mrs. MacDermid has main
tained a high position in the ranks of
concert singers because of her won
derful voice, of unusual range and
beautiful quality, together with a
musical nature and striking stage
presence. Press reports are unani
mous as to her success everywhere,
resulting in many return engagements.
Mrs. MacDermid will sing a great
variety of songs at the concert next
Monday night, affording ample dis
play of her splendid abilities. It is
the finest musical treat yet offered in
Caldwell, and the Glee Club, to
whose enterprise her coming is due,
are desirous that all who enjoy good
singing and a beautiful voice should
her Mrs. MacDermid. The Glee
Club's part on the program, under the
direction of Mr. Beale, has been well
prepared and will afford enjoyment to
all as well as satisfaction to those in
terested in the improvement of the
College Glee work. The club is larger
than ever, and will number at least
forty enthusiastc members many of
whom have fine voices. Admission is
50c and 25c, tickets to be had of Club
members. As usual, profits from Glee
concerts are devoted to the musical
work of the college. Complete pro

A romance of long standing culmi
nated Tuesday evening, December 5th,
in the wedding of Mr. Fred R. Harten
bower and Miss Ada Norine Isaac
Owing to the recent death of an aunt
of the bride's in Pendleton, the nup
tial plans were materially changed
and the wedding announcements came
as a surprise to the many friends of
the young people.
The marriage took place at the home
of the bride's father, W. H. Isaac, on
Eighth and Belmont, Dr. Boone per
forming the ceremony. The vows
were taken in the presence of a few
immediate relatives, and the happy
couple left early in the evening for
a brief honeymoon at some eastern
point not denominated. Mr. and Mrs.
Hartenbower are among the best
known young people of Caldwell, and
the hearty good wishes of a host of
friends accompanies them in this new
relationship.
Methodist Bazaar.
All day Saturday, December 9, there
will be many fancy and useful articles
for sale suitable for Chirstmas gifts,
also cooked food. Old fashion oyster
supper at 5:30. Articles for bazaar
may be left with Mrs. John Baker
organizations to some extent and for
such was it principally intended, and
if it tended to overcome evil party
organizations nothing would justify
discarding it, and some offer as ar
gument against it that it fails to per
form this act as one reason why it
should be discarded.
The primary law has not meant, with
a possible few exceptions, that more
efficient public servants sought office
and were chosen. The opposite proves
to be the case. The old convention
system has been a thousand^ times
better and more satisfactory in this
respect. Under the primary the per
sistent and pernicious office seeker
became more and more in evidence
and traded the faculty of personal
popularity and his reputation as a good
fellow for votes and buncoed the
voters in the deal. That the primary
does not register popular choice or
preference is evident from the fact
that the primary vote is sometimes
not much more, sometimes less than
50 per cent of the normal vote at a
general election. The extra added ex
pense is not justified by the results.
Reviewing all these things, not
much remains to recommend the
primary system. The voter should
weigh the benefits with the detri
ments, extract the good and separate
the bad. If this should be done it is
safe to say that the results will not
reveal much in the system that would
justify its retention, even though the
primary consideration suggested by
the Tribune to the Democratic party
in the state in suggesting its repeal,
were not entitled to first place as a
reason for its abolishment. To say
the least the primary system has been
very unsatisfactory.
CHORAL SOCIETY TO
GIVE AN OPERETTA
The High School Choral society is
studying a comic operetta, entitled
Bulbul. This work was composed by
W. Rhys-Herbert, is of a type that will
be very pleasing to those who enjoy
music of a lighter vein. The work of
electing the cast is going on this
week and the name of the prinicpals
will be announced soon. It will be im
possible to present the opera on any
tage that exists in Caldwell at the
present time, but a temporary platform
will be built in the gymnasium which
will accoinnvodatc the company of
about 60 voices. After the cast and
choruses have been choscn the remain
ing number of the Choral Society
will take up the study of choral and
glee club work, under the direction
of Miss Matson.
The book Bulbul was written by
Maude Elizabeth Inch, the author of
Sylvia" and "A Nautical Knot," and
thcr operas for young people. The
story is filled with laughs form start
to finish and will be a delight to all
who hear it. It is a tuneful opera,
picturesque in its atmosphere and
setting. It is a story that is polite
enough for a church festival and will
be staged in such outlines and with
sucli equipped singers in the prinicpal
roles that it is bound to score a big
hit.
The performance will be presented
shortly after the Xmas recess, and
will undoubtedly be given two or three
.nights.
Basketball Season Opens.
With the closing of a successful
football season the basketball men are
now leaping in the limelight. Several
class teams are already organized and
it is declared by all of the interested
high school students that the pros
pects for a championship team are
very good. Coach Houghtpn will have
charge of this work, while Mr. Smith,
Mr. Neal, Mr. Burns and Mr. Clifford
will assist with the class teams from
which the first team timber will be
selected. The schedule is already
being arranged and it is expected that
at least one game will be played be
fore the Xmas vacation. Some good
snappy basket tossing arguments will
be held in the gymnasium during the
winter, and an unusual enthusiasm is
expected to greet the opening of the
season.
Xmas Vacation to Start Dec. 20th.
School will let out on the afternoon
of December 20th at the regular time
for Xmas vacation, and will take up
again on Thursday morning, January
2nd.
Interesting programs are being pre
pared throughout the city by various
teachers for the entertainment of the
children and parents at closing time.

NEWS NOTES OF
ROYS ON BORDER
If you people at home could only
have seen the zest with which the boys
of Company G went at the prepara
tion of Thanksgiving dinner; the sol
emn conferences of officers and men,
the careful consideration of every de
tail fronj the menu to the decoration
of each squad table, the plans of the
cooks, the appointment of extra "K.
P." (cook's police, which means help
ers and waiters), the scrubbing and
cleaning, the singing and indescribable
air of bustle that pervaded the camp,
you could gain some inkling of the im
portance of the function.
Nearly a week before the good
things from home arrived, into cold
storage went the birds, while the jel
lies, cakes, pickles, candy, etc., were
carefully guarded against inhuman
vandals.
The tables, covered with the white
oilcloth, and fairly groaning with the
bounteous array of "eats" gaily de
corated with oranges in which were
stuck the little banners of freedom,
presented a really beautiful appear
ance. The turkeys, with oyster dress
ing, were unusually good—so tender
as to scarcely permit of carving
No words of a mere soldier could
adequately convey even a faint im
pression of what that dinner meant to
the boys. To a man they felt in a
better frame of mind to give thanks
than at any time since leaving Camp
Morrison at Boise. All disconent, all
rancor, all ill-feeling, was forgotten.
Especially appreciated was the gift
from Mrs. Keller, who is in her 82nd
year now. The boys declare that she
must have been a good cook even in
her early years to have reached such
perfection.
As is natural the spirit of the holi
day was shown to some extent in
pranks. One of the boys living near
Caldwell was sent all over the camp
hunting for a missing "pie-stretcher,"
while the company barter, Elzie L.
Johnston, was prevailed upon by the
__ j ^ ^
solemn-faced cooks to go and try to
borrow a "sky hook" for an hour
The home folks may feel fully re
paid for all their trouble. Everything
was so righly appreciated.
Discipline is being more rigidly en
of the lower grades in preparation of
gifts for their parents and friends.
Teachers' Meeting at High School.
The annual teachers' association
meeting of Canyon county is to be
held in the high school building, De
cember 19th, beginning at 10:30 a. m.
The county superintendent is very
anxious to have every teacher in the
county present, as an excellent pro
gram is to he presented. It is ex
pected that over 100 teachers will be
in attendance.
forced in the company now and the
boys appear to like it. The change to
patrol work in the drill periods may
account to some extent for the in
creased interest among the men. The
work in the open and the interest of
an actual problem helps to lighten tin
work. Outpost problems will next
occupy attention.
Capt. Banks has secured a Wavo In
dian war bow, quiver and «arrows—
one taken from those that were armed
with rifles on the Mexican side. They
are scarce and highly prized. The
Indians are very chary in parting with
their arms or equipment and it is next
to impossible to secure a Yaqui In
dian drum.
Thanksgiving night the people living
in Nog-ales, Sonora, heard the wierd
sound of the Indian drums (about 1000
Indians being encamped on the Mexi
can side) and it is reported they left
for the border of Chihuahua, there to
fight the followers of Villa.
One thing which may surprise many
and which goes to show the undying
hatred of "los Grigoes" is the fact that
this feeling is instilled in the minds of
the youngest school children. In the
histories of the states a little farther
south is found the phrase "the Stars
and Stripes, that hated banner of in
famy." The date of the Carrizal "in
cident" is formally observed as a na
tional holiday, and the assassin of
"Gringocs" is ever hailed a national
hero.
The people of Mexico are past un
derstanding, according to a missionary
who has spent the best part of his
life working among them. They are
kind-hearted to a fault—and yet fiend
ishly brutal and cruel. They arc gen
tle and courteous—and yet love the
sight of blood and suffering. Never
was one ever seen to put an animal
sorely hurt out of his misery. They
crowd around and watch the contor
tions of agony with keen zest. An
instance was given by this same mis
sionary of the crudity of the laws.
Two men coming out of a saloon were
scuffling good naturedly, when one
was thrown between the wheels of a
loaded ox-cart. These carts arc piled
high with hard-wood—extremely
heavy—and are drawn by four and six
oxen. The wheel passed over the
man's head, crushing it. According to
law it is a very serious offence to
touch a body of this sort until a
magistrate has viewed the remains
The man was not killed instantly and
a magistrate was sent for immediately
in order that the victim might receive
medical attention. The lewal <
man was playing cards and drinking
mescal with friends—so the
wretch lay weltering in his blood
from early in the morning until 11
o'clock at night. He died soon after
wards.
The Indians arc very savage. The
Mayo Indians being said to practice
cannabalism. This is accredited by
those in position to know the peoples
of Mexico
Letters From the Boys.
Editor Tribune: I have been asked
to send a few lines to the people at
home, telling of our work.
At the present time we are engaged
in the interesting work of patrol duty
and each day take extensive "hikes"
into the hills and stalk each other in
such style that we have all the Indians
in this vicinity turning green with
envy. The fact of the matter is, we
are becoming quite proficient in the
savage art of patrolling and it is not
an uncommon sight to see a Buck
Private come back to his company
with a captain of the enemy as his
prisoner.
Such an incident as the above is
what makes the work of patrolling ap
peal to the enlisted men, because it is
a delightful sensation to take an of
ficer prisoner and march him to the
rear as your man. It makes one feel
superior to him, in woodcraft if not in
rank. |Sgt. Braskamp ought to know
for that is just what he did on the last
dav out—Capt. Banks).
So take it all in all I believe the men
like patrolling better than the ordinary
routine of drill.
That Thanksgiving dinner sure mad
it a big day. Did we do justice to the
feed? It was even better than pay
day!

FILMS HAVE BEEN
SHOWN.
Managers Warned That Ordinances
Will Be Enforced—Hayman Intro
duces Resolution Which Is Adopted
—Municipal Employes Want In
crease in Snlaries—Regular and
Routine Business Transacted as
Usual.
Caldwell needs an official censor
over motion pictures. It is stated that
pictures have been shown in this city
which cause our city dads to blush.
If it happens again proceedings will
be instituted. The motion picture man
agers have been warned that ordi
nances exist covering their cases.
The police have been notified to act
instanter in case anything shows up
in the future.
At the regular meeting of the city
council Monday evening it transpired
that members of the administration
had had their attention called to mo
tion pictures which, it is said, had ex
rcised a deleterious influence on the
morals of the community.
Ordinance Invoked.
Alderman H. H. Hayman presented
the following resolution which was
dontcd :
"Whereas, pictures arc understood
have been shown in violation of
ordinance 160. section 25, paragraph 8;
be it resolved by the mavor and city
council of the city of Caldwell, that
the chief of police be and, is hereby
instructed to notify the moving picture
shows operating in said city that vio
ation of said ordinance in the future
shall make them liable to be punished
s per said ordinance, and that said
chief of police is hereby further in
tructed to consult the city attorney
in bringing about the arrest and pros
ecution of those violating said ordi
nance."
Ordinance Provides Penalty.
The ordinance paragraph cited in
the resolution reads: "No person shall
within the city of Caldwell exhibit or
perform any indecent, immoral or
lewd play or other representation."
For violation of the provision a fine
not to exceed $100 is established.
The film which caused the discussion
has been show.n in nearly all the towns
throughout the country. If the in
fluence exerted elsewhere was as
pernicious as it is said to have been in
Calwell the country today is on the
verge of moral bankruptcy if it has
not been ruined.
Higer Salaries Asked.
The city treasurer, clerk and water
department, and the sexton asked for
an increase in salary. The city attor
ney will investigate and report. The
salaries of the elective officers cannot
be increased during the term for which
they were elected. The appointive
officers may secure an increase.
As an offset to the high cost of liv
ing, requests for increases in salaries
were presented to the council. The
city attorney was asked to investigate
the merits of the requests and report
at a subsequent session.
George A Crookham, whose previ
ous request for vacation of a portion
of South Third street had been de
nied, asked for permission to use the
strip of street until such time as the
council may decide to put in a bridge
over Indian creek and make a thor
oughfare of the now unused land. De
cision in the matter was voted into
the hands of the city attorney and
councilman from the Third ward.
Unimportant matters pertaining to
streets and alleys, camtracts for a
short stretch of sidewalk and insur
ance on the fire engine, were also
disposed of.
T. A. Walters still serves in the ca
pacity of city attorney, though his ele
vation to the office of attorney gen
eral of Idaho must soon .necessitate
his resignation.
Caldwell Pupils in Recital.
A quartet of the vocal pupils of
Mrs. Florence Appy of Nampa, who
conducts a studio at the Gartin home

young ladies, who will be accompanied
by a number of their friends, are the
Misses Viva Lesley. Ruth Boulton,
Delorts Catlow and Uldine Gartin.
The Rebekahs are planning an even
ing of unusual interest Monday, De
11th. In addition to a miscellaneous
program. Dr. Boone will give his il
lustrated lecture on the Panama canal,
and toothsome refreshments at ten
cents per will conclude the activities.
Everybody is invited.
Mrs. T. A. Walters was a capital
city visitor Wednesday, house hunt
ing being the one subject uppermost
in the mind of the wife of the state's
attorney-elect.
Mrs. Clara Ballard was called over
to Homedale last Friday to the bed
side of her son, Henry, who was
brought to his home in this city Mon
day suffering with pneumonia.
Miss Emily Wood of Boise was a
guest at the Hartenbower-Isaac nup
