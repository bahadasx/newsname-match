REVIVAL IS OVER
EVANGELIST BRYAN CALLED TO
HELP STATE BOARD HEAD
Two Weeks' Protracted Meeting
Closes At Baptist Church Splen
did Sermons Were Heard
Revival services at the Stanford
Baptist church which have been in
progress for a little over two wee!-s,
were brought to a close Thursday
night when Rev. O. E. Bryan, state
Baptist evangelist, who has been do
ing the preaching, was called to Lou
isville to take up his new work as as
sistant to Dr. W. E. Powell, secretary
of the Baptist State Board of Mis
sions. Rev. Bryan was elected to his
new duties at a meeting of the board
at Louisville Tuesday. Dr. M. D.
Early, pastor of the local church, is
a member of the board, and attended
the meeting at which Rev. Bryan was
given his new duties. Dr. Powell is in
very poor health and is compelled to
undergo a serious operation at once.
Great interest was manifested in
the services from the beginning to
end, and much regret was felt that
Rev. Bryan was called away before
the meeting was concluded. He is a
man of unusual power in presenta
tion of the Word, and every sermon
was delivered in his own neculiar
and forceful way. He made many see
the old gospel truths in a new light,
and at the same time made many
warm friends and admirers here,
whose best wishes will ever be with
him in his great work.
At the close of the services
Thursday night, Pastor Early said
that he could wish that in some unit
ed way all the churches of Stanford
could unite to carry on this revival,
in some large tent or assembly hall;
that he was anxious to see the work
go on in Stanford. At tha meeting
of the Baptist board, the selection of
an assistant to Dr. Powell was made
necessary by the adoption of the bud
get plan to distribute the financial
contributions to the board.
The Rev. W. L. Brock, of Lexing
ton, was re-electe.d as Sunday School
secretary and Paul. Powell, son of
Dr. Powell.rwhoAvasa B. Yt. PjlL,
" secretary, of iTouisvillcwas made his
assistant. The Rev. N. T. Barnes, of
Louisville, was re-elected secretary of
the Kentucky B. Y. P. U. and A. E.
Wohlbold made office secretary and
assistant treasurer.
Additional appropriations were
voted Baptist Woman's Missionary
Urion to enable them to enlarge their
sphere of usefulness. The union mw
has ovfr 1,100 organizations in the
state.
Aside from the Budget the board
has also taken on itself, as part cf
coming year's program, the study of
plans and the raising of between
$300,000 and $500,000 for the en
dowment and equipment of the de
nominational schools and colleges
throughout the state.

LOSES HAND IN HEMP BREAK.
S. R. Wider, who bought the Mc
Roberts farm in the Shelby City sec
tion, a few years ago, had his right
hand amputated Wednesday as a re
sult of getting it caught in a new
style hemp breaking machine. Mr.
Wilder was working one of the new
makes of machines on his farm with
his large hemp crop, and in reaching
up in to the machine got his hand
caught. The machine could not be
stopped in time to save the member,
and when he was released the mem
ber was horribly crushed. Physicians
found it necessary to amputate the
hand above the wrist. This is Mr.
Wilder's second serious accident, he
having lost a limb several years ago.

Eb Kennedy's Bad Luck
Assessor Falls and Breaks Shoulder

fall. With Mrs. Kennedy in the hos

Mr. Kennedy is now laid up at his
home on Hustonville street with a
broken shoulder. While cutting meat
on his back porch Wednesday, he
took a step backward, missed his
footing and went off the porch, strik
ing on his shoulder and breaking his
left shoulder. The injury is a very
painful one. Physicians set the mem
ber and did all in their power, but
Mr. Kennedy will be confined to his
home for some time.
Boyle Claims Senator
But Billy Gooch and Clay Kauffman
Are "Mentioned."
District politicians are beginninr
to pay some attention to the senato
rial race which comes off next year,
at the same time as the county pri
maries. The Louisville Times this
week said:
Friends of Jay Harlan, the well
known lawyer and politician of Dan
ville, are booming him for State
Senator in the district composed of
Boyle, Lincoln, Garrard and Casej
counties, and he is expected to be
sure starter in the race. Boyle coun
ty claims the right to furnish the
nominee for State Senator next time
and insists that the rotation agree
ment between the counties in that
senatorial district has long been dis
regarded so far as Boyle county is
concerned. The point is made that
it has been twenty years since Boyle
county furnished a Senator and he
was a Republican, E. C. Linneyt
It would appear that the other
counties in the Eighteenth senatorial
district are not taking the claim of
Boyle county seriously, for it is un
derstood that Lincoln county will put
forward Representative W. G. Gooch
and that Representative H. Clay
Kauffman, of Garrard county, will
try for the seat in the State Senate.
Both served in the last legislature
and were lined up with the State
Administration. The present State
i Senator' from that district is Charles
F. Montgomery, of Casey county. His
predecessor was R. L. Hubble, of
Lincoln county who served two terms
of eight years, and he succeeded
George T. Farris, of Garrard county
who was also a State Senator for
eight years.
Looks Like a County Judge.
(From Lancaster Fecord)
Hon. Thomas A. Rice was mingling
with his friends on county court day
in Lancaster who came over from
Lincoln county. Mr. Rice is an an
nounced candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination for county judge
of his county, subject to the next
August primary. Judge Rice tells us
that he is in the fight to win and to
a fellow on the outside it looks good
for him at this time. His friends
say that he is far in the lead and
will probably land the winner next
August. We are not advised, how
ever, as to his chances, but we do
know that our Democratic neighbors
in Lincoln cannot find a better dem
ocrat to lead their ticket next year.
Tom Rice is not only a true blue dem
ocrat but is a gentleman of ability
with a wide business experience and
is in every way equipped to look af
ter the fiscal affairs of his countv.
Here's hoping that he may win the
goal of his ambition. 97-1

Martha Circle Entertains
Delightful Affair at Crab Orchard
East End Items.
Crab Orchard, dec. 8.
The "Martha Circle" held their
first carnival at the Masonic Hall,
Saturday evening, Nov. 25th, and a
large crowd attended. On both sides
of the hall beautiful booths were
erected. The first booth to the right
beautifully draped in scarlet and
green was the fancy work display,
where everything in lovely needle
work was shown. This work showed
skill, patience and taste and was
presided over by Miss Myrtle Mur
ray and Mrs. Myrtle Goodwin. Next
came the candy and peanut booth,
draped in white and red hangings,
and contained a most tempting dis
play of delicious home made candies
and freshly roasted peanuts. It was
presided over by Misses Ethye Geiszl
and Mary Siler, with Irene Manuel,
Eva Geiszl, Elizabeth Newland and
Mary Messer, as helpers and you
know it was a sweet booth. Next on
the same side of the hall was the well
which held in its depths many useful
and handsome packages, which were
drawn up and presented by Misses
Tanna Thompson and Nadine Mc
Clure. This was a very popular scheme
and many more packages could have
been disposed of if they had been
there. The well scene was a pretty
one. Cedar boughs, palms, ferns and
other plants surrounding it, made it
a most realistic affair.
Then acioss the entire end of the
hall stood the chocolate and cake
booth, presided over by the mother of
the circle, Mrs. M. E. Fish, who wa.
beautifully attired in pure white and
never .looked better. She was assisted
ed by the president of the order, Mrs
Frazier Kurt, Misses Byrd Perkins,
Mayme Holman, and Myrtle Jones.
This booth was certainly handsome.
Over the lop were suspended bright
stars and immediately under the cen
ter was suspended an ornamental cir
cle and in the center in silver letters
the word"Martha." Everywhere
were natural looking roses, lilies and
other flowe'r suspended and large
bunches Vj74fiSIlK.t": cu glass vases.
The pink, green and white looked
very beautiful against a back ground
of pure white. Holly and mistletoe
peeped at you everywhere. Here was
found the most delicious cake and
chocolate and it was liberally patron
ized and was the handsomest booth of
all.
On the left side of the hall was the
coffee and sandwich booth draped
tastefully in the national colors, with
the American flag handsomely drap
ed overhead. Here was to be found
the finest .coffee, splendid sand
wiches, salads, pickles and was
gracefully presided over by Mrs.
Jamie Carpenter, Misses Jewell Good

Next was the weird home of the
Fortune Teller. Outside was perched
a wise looking owl and other em-
I blems pertaining to the craft. Insule

Good music, good behavior and a
liberal patronage amounting to $45
was what the circle had to thank the
public for. Mrs. Allie Pettus assisted
by many of the young people fur
nished the music and special songs by
Miss Tanna Thompson made every
thing pass pleasantly.
Dr. Doores, who has been v.ry lov

This was formerly the D. B. Edmiston
property and one of the nicest homes
here. The whole town is in sadness
over having to give up this excellent
family.
Miss Alene Collier brought a lit
tle school mate home with her from
Mt. Vernon to stay from Saturday
until Monday with Mr. and Mrs. R.
L. Collier.
Rev. C. E. Wyatt preached splen
did sermons Sunday morning and
night at the Christian church. The
subject of the morning discourse was
"Purity of Life," and was ably and
plainly handled, but his crowning ef
fort was brotherhood, as it takes in
the whole world, which, he so ele
gantly and beautifully presented at
the evening service. Rev. Wyatt has
grown better and better since his
first sermon at this place, and now
as his work for the church here is
nearing its close, his grandest ser
mons are being given us. It is owing
to ill health that he leaves Crab Or
chard for a wanner climate.
Miss Mary Lucile Burgin returned
to Campbellsville Monday, after a
pleasant visit to her family and
friends during Thanksgiving. She is
well pleased with her school there.

RICE GETS IN RACE
SECOND CANDIDATE TO
FOR COUNTY JUDGE
RUN
Writes a Strong Card to the Demo
crats, Setting Forth Platform He
Will Stand Upon.
With the reorganization of the
Democratic County Committee out
the way, interest in county politics is
growing daily, and many candidates
are being groomed by their friends.
The second candidate to announce
for the Democratic nomination for
the County Judgeship is out today.
He is Tom A. Rice, a prominent
Stanford farmer, who made a very
creditable race four years ago, and
has jumped into the running this
time with "both feet" and is getting
ready to "go some." He issues a
strong card to the democrats of the
county setting forth his claims, as
follows :
To Democrats of Lincoln County.
I am a candidate for County Judge
at the primary election to be held the
first Saturday in August, 1917.
I entered the primary in 1913 for
this same office, known by only a
few, outside of tKis Magisterial dis
trict, against two of the most widely
known democrats in the county and
was defeated by only a few votes.
The experience I gained in that race,
the new friends I made and the sol
id support of my old friends, of
which I am assured will return me a
winner this time. If my ambition is
idealized, I shall give the county's
business the same careful attention,
that I give my private business.
The strictest economy in the ex
penditure of the county's funds, con
sistent with efficiency, will be prac
ticed. The turnpike funds should be
used where most needed and where
iberiwCted. I shall make frequent
BoB'.bf the pikes and dirt roads.. .'
