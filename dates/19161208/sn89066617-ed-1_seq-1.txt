COMMITTEE OF FOUR
TO HANDLE CAMPAIGN
Fund to be Asked to Wage Stiff
Contest-Drys Say They ;
Will Win.
Six members of the Men's Clul met
at the Centenary Methodist Church
last night and definitely decided to
hold a local option election in this
county in the spring.
It was decided to enlist the sup
port of the Protestant churches, and
an effort will be made to induce the
colored religious organizations also to
assist. W. H. Stubblefield Jr., in
speaking of the need of a campaign
fund, said: "It is necessary fr "s
to whip the 'nigger preachers' and the
niggers' into line. The 'niggers' are
for our cause. Two met me on the
street the other day and asked if we
were going to hold an election in the
.spring. When 1 said we were, they
wanted to know if we didn't need a
little help."
Mr. Stubblefield, Otto Kochtitzky
and Rev. J. C. Handy were the prin
cipal speakers. AH of them expatiated
upon the need of prohibition in Cape
Girardeau County, and made sugges
tions for prosecuting he campaign.
" .Mr. Stubblefield urged the impor
tance of a campaign lund. He said
11 woufd he an easy matter to get sub
.scriptions along Main street and
Broadwav. A committee, composed of
U. F. Davis, Prof. W. W. Martin, Rev.
J. J. Clopton and Mr. Follard, was se
lected to effect a union of the Protest
ant churches that are in favor of pro
hibition. This committee will work in
conjunction with the Men's Club and
tne Citizen's Committee.
It was pointed out that a majority
of Dr. Clopton's congregation were
wet, but he had volunteered his active
services in the local option campaign.
Jt was at Dr. Clopton's suggestion, the
speaker said, that the minister be giv
en a prominent part in the campaign.
Those present at last night's meet
ing predicted that prohibition would
sweep the county. Banker Stubble
lield suggested that a public audito
rium be built from public funds, and
he also advised that a moving picture
campaign be waged in the interest of
the cause. Collections will be taken
up each Sunday at the various church-
es co-operating in the movement, and
this monev will be used to keep up
interest in the campaign
"Why, go along Main and Broad
way," he said, "and in three hours we
can have subscribed sufficient money
from the merchants to defray the ex
penses of a campaign." He then enu
merated all the merchants who, in his
estimation, would give "ten," and came
to the conclusion that this would be a
very popular subscription.
He then added that the "nigger
preachers" and the "niggers" could be
lined up for their cause and be of a
great aid to the movements. "Why,
the other day, two 'niggers' stopped
me on the street, and asked me wheth
er I was going to get busy in the
spring and I answered yes. Why, Mis
tah Stubblefield, you'll need some help
wont you? I told them that I would
let them know if their assistance was
needed
Stubblefield then related his experi
ence with a "boo;f fiighter" who had
been introduced to him by Rev. Bem
berg, pastor of the German Evangel
ical Church, about a yar ago. "The
man was brought to me with the re
quest that I provide transportation for
him to St Louis, and when I smelled
the odor of beer on his breath, I re
buked him for spending his money for
hnriTP. At the same time I thought
this was good lecture for Bemberg."
This caused the chairman of the
meeting to inject a few remarks about
his effprts of trying to enlist the aid
of Rev.' Bemberg for the prohibition
cause. "He's a German, he can't
speak any English, he hasn't good

Huge Flame Destroyer Takes

Independence Hill.
DEMONSTRATOR WILL
TEACH CHIEF TODAY
Firemen Will be Taught How to
Operate Monster Truck
Conies Monday.
The new automobile fire engine ar
rived yesterday afternoon and was
driven through the streets after it had
been unloaded from the box car near
Main and Independence streets. A
large crowd gathered to see the big
erd machine make its initial trip
through the streets of the Cape. The
second automobile truck, which is a
combination hook and ladder wagon
and hose reel, will be here Monday
afternoon.
Mayor Kage and Councilman Fowler
and Black were on hand when the
machine was unloaded. They com
posed the committee that had been em
powered to buy the apparatus for the
city. A demonstrator came with the
apparatus to instruct the firemen how
to operate the heavy engine. He drove
it through the streets of the city to
give the citizens an opportunity to see
the device in action. Without even
slowing up, the automobile engine
climbed the steep hill on Independence
street on its way to the engine house.
The remodeling of the old engine
house had just been completed during
the afternoon and was ready to re
ceive the new apparatus. The doors
were widened, as well as the stall in
which the old fire wagon had been
kept. It is now large enough to keep
the automobile engine and the other
truck side by side.
Todav the firemen will begin to re
ceive their instructions in operating
the machine. Chief Barney Kraft will
be given his first lesson and the other
three will be taught later on. If nec
essary, the demonstrator will remain
here for four weeks, to train the fire
men. The automobile engine has a length
of 2S feet. It is painted in scarlet red.
The motor has six double cylinders,
developing a total of 72 horsepower,
and a double ignition. It is equipped
with the latest improvements of an
automobile. The motor is also used
to pump the water in combatting fires.
All that is necessary is the shifting of
a cock on the side of the automobile
and the motor of the automobile be
gins to pump the water. The suction
hose has a diameter of eight inches.
while the outlet hose is only six inch
es in width.
The second part of the new fire
equipment will be shipped tomorrow
and will arrive at the latest by next
Monday. After its arrival the old
outfit wil lbe turned over to the Rob
inson concern. The second automobile

truck, but is considerably longer. This
is necessitated because of the lengm
of the ladders. This second automo
bile will only be used when the entire
force is called out to fight a lire. In
ordinary cases the engine alone will
be used.
MRS. G. H. GROSS WILL BE
Rl'RIED THIS AFTERNOON
Body of Well-Known Woman Will Be

when the body of Mrs. Louise Gross,
who died Wednesday morning at her
home, will be buried in the Lorimier
Cemetery. Rev. August Wilder, pastor
of the Lutheran Trinity Church, will
be in charge of the ceremony.
The cortege will leave the home
about 1:30 o'clock and will proceed to
the Lutheran Trinity Church, where
Rev. Wilder will deliver the funeral
oration.

Besides Cape County.ten other coun-Tne as not a political prophet,

and each countv was awarded a schol- i dressed many political gatherings, and
arship for the ensuing year.
There were contestants, far more
than in any previous exhibition of this
jkind, which is an annual event. Sev
eral counties only had a single entry,
but Cape County submitted the work
of seven girls. The contest was pre
sided over by Miss Ida Shilling, who
was assisted by several teachers of
the State Normal.
Each contestant offered a sample of
her own baking. A letter, showing the
kind of flour used, the brand of yeast
and the process of baking, had to ac
company the bread that was entered.
Pans of a standard size, namely i 'ax-41-x2,2
inches, had to be used in bak
ing the loaves. Any variety of fiour
was permissible and the number of
loaves was left optional with the baker,
provided the number was kept vithin
reason.
Each loaf was examined as to its
taste and quality, its appearance and
wholesomeness. The contest was clos
ed at noon yesterday, and immediate
ly thereafter, the committee began the
examination. The scholarship award
ed the winners will cover the registra
tion fees for one year.

WATER HEARING POSTPONED
The public heard on the new intake
apparatus for the water works wa.s
not held yesterday morning because
I. R. Kelso, attorney for the water
company, could not be present. It was
postponed, but no date was set.
The question is whether the com
pany shall be permitted to install a
new intake pipe for the water works
instead of a water tower. The Water
and Light Committee of the City
Council was taken to the water works
by a representative of the water com
pany so that they might familiarize
themselves with the situation.
Joe Price's Bean
Is Shaved to Pay
Bet on Election
He Thought Mr. Hughes Had
the Election Tacked Down,
and Bet on Judgment
Eyebrows Qnly Hair Left
on Cranium.
Joseph H. Price, lodge leader, and
told the populace that Charles E.
Hughes was the next -President of the
United States. "Remember what I
am telling you, gentlemen," he told
the big audience in Bollinger County.
A few days before the electmo, Mr.
Price was bearing down quite substan
tially on the qualifications of Mr.
Hughes to take care of the country,
when a friend, vhose name he re
fuses to divulge, said: "Joe, you are
a ham political prophet."
The lodge man was somewhat flab
bergasted at his friend's frankness,
but came back with this rejoiner: "If
Wilson is re-elected, I will have my
head shaved as naked as a door knob,
if you will do likewise in the event
Justice Hughes wins."
It was agreed, and Mr. Price spent
the next ten minutes endeavoring to
give a bird's-eye view of how his
friend would look with the fur re
moved from his eyebrows up.
When the returns began to come in
on the night of Nov. 7, Mr. Price con
ferred with some acquaintances as to
whether he would compel his friend,
who lost, to use .a safety or .mst a
regular razor.
Two days later, when it became ap
parent that Mr. Hughes had only been
fooling the country, Joseph H. Price
remembered that he had an appoint
ment to organize a lodge up in Perry
County. From that county he travel
ed to Jefferson County, organizing
fraternal lodges and trying to forget
that he had ever been a friend of Mr.
Hughes.
. He finished all of his business and
returned home a few days ago. His
friend located Mr. Price yesterday and
escorted him to a nearby barber shop
to be sheared.
- "Why, we were only kidding that
1 night," remarked Mr. Price, "and be
sides there is going to be a change in
the weather and I'll take a terrible
cold."
But his tale of woe was- all for
j naught
The friend insisted that Price
keep the agreement. "If pushed, I
will," said Price, and he did.
When he climbed out of the ton-
sorialist's chair he was a barren of
hair as a bald eagle.
"111 bet four-bits that we have a
blizzard withia 24 hours," remarked
the candidate. for chief of police as he
gazed into the wirror. "Ytmr eye
brows stand out like bird Best," re
marked the barber, and 5fr. Price departed.

HUTSON FINDS 50 OF
73 "ILLEGAL" VOTERS
Sheriff-Elect Says Two Thirds of
Mea Condemned Voted the
Sepublican Ticket.
Fifty of the seventy-three names of
Cape Girardtauans, who were accused
of voting illegally at the last election,
were located yesterday by Chief Hut
son, whose election as sheriff is being
contested by Henry Brinkopf, who was
defeated.
"Every one of the fifty men is a
legal voter," said Chief Hutson last
night. "Some of tiese men have been
residents of the county for more than
half a century- I worked on the list
of seventy-three silghtly more than a
day, and I have not failed te find any
man I went to look for.
"I am confident that none of the
seventy-three, who are charged with
having voted illegally, are without
places of abode, as the petition
charges. I am quite sure that no non
resident voted in this city. About two
thirds of the fifty men I have inter
viewed, say they voted the straight
Republican ticket.
"If the seventy-three names were
thrown out, it would increase my lead
to about one hundred."
The contest suit was filed by Henry
Brinkopf, the Republican nominee, who
was defeated for the second time for
sheriff. He lost to William Summers,
the Democratic nominee, four yeara
ago. In Brinkopf's petition, he charges
that his defeat was brought about by
ballot-box stuffing.
PEARY PREDICTS ANOTHER IT. S.
CANAL ACROSS THE ISTHMUS
Says Panama Waterway Is Not Ade
quate to Handle Vast Volume,
of Shipping.
Philadelphia, Dec. 7. Rear-Admiral
Robert E. Feary in an address before
the Geographical Society of Philadel
phia last night predicted that the Gov
ernment would, within a few years,
build another great canal across the
Central American isthmus.
"The Panama Canal," said Admiral
Peary, is not great enough to handle
the vast amount of commerce which
seeks passage and the only course
open is the building of another canal
across Nicaragua. The work will be
of practically the same magnitude as
that which resulted in the Panama
waterway."

AS GRANDMAS WALTZ
Details for Colonial Ball Are Ar
ranged at Feast at The
Pott Home.
At the luncheon given for the mem-!
bers of the Cemetery Association at
the home of Mrs. Louis Pott, yester
day afternoon, it Mas decided that the
Colonial bull, which will be held in ;
the Yery near future, will be a hoop
skirt affair, in spite of early reports
to the contrary.
Becau.-e of the scarcity of these
Zeppelin-shapf d pieces of wearing ap
parel, it was announced a few days
ago that it would be impossible to
feature the hoop-skirt. It was stated,
at the meeting yesterday that since
the publication in The Tribune, the
idea had become so popular that it
could not be abandoned now.
Following the luncheon and the dis
cussion of the Colonial ball, the ladies
cleared the room and for one hour
danced the quadrille, and the Virginia
reel, two-steps tt will be featured
at the coming ball.
The previous announcement that
oniy larlies of 60 years or over would
be permitted to dance, will be ad
hered to, it was announced yesterday.
Two dozen ladies have volunteered to
dance Ln hoop-skirts.
The archives in every section of the
city will be searched for hoop-skirts
that were chucked away when that
type of dress passed into the realm of
forgotten hobbies. It was stated yes
terday that at least one dozen have
been located, and it is believed there
are at least that many more -unreported.
The ball will be one of the most
unique effairs given in this city in
mtfny years. The ladies will be dress
ed as Colonial dames, wearing Martha
Washington bonnets, hair powdered
and parted in the middle, just as the
ladies used to dress when the father
of hi country was a member of the
political big league.
The music for this entertainment
will be supplied by old-time tiddlers.
A committee ha.s been asked to enter
into negotiations with Mr. Graves,
Cape Girardeau's champion tiddler. If
his services can be had, he will be ask
ed to organize a company of tiddlers.
After the ladies quit dancing and
eating yesterday, a number of toasts
were proposed: "To A Woman," by-
Mrs. George Patton, made a hit;
ran:
"She needs no apology
It
She speaks for herself.
She's the fairest work of
the Great
Author;
The edition is large enough,
And no man should be without a copy."
Another toast, which also pleased,
was by Mrs. Pott, which ran:
"Here's to the three powers of the
day the press, the pulpit, and a wom
an. The first spreads knowledge, the
second spreads "morals and the third
spreads considerably."
All of the ladies who attended the
luncheon were assessed 50 cents each.
nresent were: Miss Frances
Bohnsack, Mrs. Emil Pott, Mrs. Emil
Sebastion. Mrs. Carl Eauer, Mrs. Mc
Carthy, Mrs. Louis Tott, Mrs. John
Meystedt, Mrs. Tony Gockel, Mrs.

Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Berlin. Dec. 7, by wireless to Say
ville. The defeated Rumanians are re
treating along the whole front, fol
lowing the fall of Bucharest and Tlo
echti, the War Off.ce anounced today.
The Teutonic troops have captured
Campino, on the railroad between
Kronstadt and Pioechti 20 miles north
west of Pioechti. In yesterday's fight
ing more than 1)000 Rumanians were
captured.
The Bulgarians repulsed an attack
by the Biitish yesterday in the Stru
nian sector of the Macedonian front.
Near the Cerna River positions taken
on the previous day by the Servians
were recaptured.
The statement reads:
"Front of Archduke Joseph In the
wooded Carpathians and on the front
of the Moldavian Mountains, there was
a temporary increase in the artillery
(ire and advance skirmishes, from
which there developed Russian attacks
north of Dorna Watra ami in the Tro
tus valley. These were it-puked.
"Army group of Fit-Id Marshal von
Mackensen Notable successes yester
day crowned the efforts and the en
gagements in which, in command of
Field Marshal von Mackensen, the
troops of the Ninth and the Danube
armies, under clear-sighted leadership,
defeated the Rumanian enemy and the
Russian reinforcements that had been
summoned to it, by means of speedy
strokes. The commander and the
troops received the reward of their
victory Bucharest, the capital of the
country, which is now the latest vic
tim of thi entente policy; together
with Pioechti, Campino and Sinaia,
which are in our possession.
"The defeated enemy is retreating
eastward along the entire front. Cour
ageous fighting spirit and a tenacious
will for victory caused the troops that
attacked and conquered to respond to
all the efiorts asked of them. In ad
dition to the German main forces,
brave Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian
Turkish troops did splendid work.
"The Ninth Army reports the tak
ing yesterday of 106 officers and tHO'i
men as prisoners.
"The operations and engagements
are proceeding."
The fall of Bucharest was observed
in a manner reminiscent of th cele
brations last year of victories ngain.-t
the Russians. The newspapers iscue.'.
extra editions, which were scattered
among the crowds free of charge an i
read with the greatest eagerness. A
merry mood seized the crowds in the
streets. The restaurants were filled
with crowds uproariously singing pa
triotic airs. Today the streets are
decked lavishly with flags.
The newspapers are unanimous in
the opinion that Rumania is now vir
tually eliminated as a factor in the
war. The Lokal Anzeiger even doubts
whether the Romania State ever will
exist again.
