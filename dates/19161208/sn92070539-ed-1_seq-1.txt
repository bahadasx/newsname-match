In the preliminaries Willie

over the Insurrecto Kid at the
end of their 6 round bout.
Terrible Teddy Murphy and
Pug Doyle fought 8 fast rounds,
at the end of which the bout was
declared a draw.
Peter Buzukos won over Art
Spencer in the wrestling match
by puting his opponent to the
mat twice in less than fifteen
minutes.
In the same ring on Thursday
evening, "Bull" Foster was given
a Judges? decision over Joe
Potts at the end of 15 rounds
of very fast fighting. The de
cision of the Judges seemed to
displease the fight fans, and
there were many who declared
that a draw was the most that
Foster should have been given.
In the preliminaries, Jack Mc
Kensie and the Insurrecto Kid
fought an 8 round draw.
Buddy Hamilton won from
Jack Myers, who refused to fight
any more after the third round.
The fight fans of Columbus
were very much in evidence at
both the above contests. The

MR. AND. MRS. PIERCE
ATTEND CONVENTION
Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Pierce of
Sunnyside attended the conven
tion of the New Mexico teachers
in Santa Fe last week. Mrs.
Pearce is the teacher at Sunny
side and her expenses were paid
by the district. Mr. Pearce was
selected to attend the convention
upon the expense of the county
for the purpose of reporting up
on the advantages of the meet
inir and whether or not the mon-
nv snnnt for this nnrnnsi. was1
really worth while.
They made the trip in their
car, Mr. Pierce stating to the
Courier that the state roads af
ter leaving Luna County were
in excellent condition.
PIERCE BRINGS IN
BIG WHITE SWAN
S. C. Pierce brought into Co
lumbus Friday morning a fine
large white swan which he found
on the pond at his ranch. There
is a large lake on the ranch and
there has been quite a lot of
duck shooting there, and when
he saw the swan it was at the
bank and unable to fly, someone
possibly having shot at the fine
bird and wounded him. He will
send it to a taxidermist and have
it mounted.
A swan in this country is
something very unusual. They
have been seen, however, in that
section before, though no one
had ever succeeded in capturing
one of the birds before.
The swan will soon bo extinct
and they are protected by federal
statute.
