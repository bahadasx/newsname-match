16th of next month, and who
came all the way In from 5625
South J street Wednesday after
noon to do her buying.
She was pretty stiff this morn
ing, and says she'.'sesn't want to
try it again very soon, but she's
glad she did It.
Her daughter, Mrs. C. F. Whit
ney, went with her.
"We had to walk four blocks
to tlie jitney," said the elder Mrs.
Whitney ln relating her adven
ture, "but the driver drove right
up to Mc.Cormack's store, so I
wouldn't have to walk across the
street.
First Time in Year.
"I hadn't been downtown for
about a year. I guess—l forget
exactly. The streets made me
think of Saturday afternoons in
the town near our farm I ack ln
Kansas. There were so many
people. No, I didn't look into the
shop windows much; I knew lust
what 1 wanted—some warm
things for the winter."
Mrs. Whitney was born In Ver
mont, and was married when she
was 17. She has two sons living
in Seattle, 0. F. Whitney, with
whom Blie makes her home, and J.
C. Stiles, 14 17 South 58th.
"How many grandchildren have
you?" she was asked, as the lay
in bed Thursday morning, recov
ering from her expedition.
Eleven and Twelve.
"I guess you'll have to count
them," she laughed to her daugh

A count totaled 11 grandchil

SUICIDE THEORY UNDER
FIRE IN MURDER TRIA
Did Mrs. Stella Pierw ;za com
mit suicide at her home in Wilke
son on the night of Oct. 20, or
was she brutally slain by her hus
band?
At the outset of the trial of
John Plerwsza for murder, the
state undertook Friday to dispose
once for all of the sulci.le theory,
on which. It Is believed, the de
fense will base Its case.
County Coroner F. J. Stewart,
who directed the Inquest the day
after the killing, for tho state,
pointed out that it would have
been out of the question lor her
to have shot herself throngh the
head and then to have walked be
hind the kitchen stove were the
body was found.
Trouble With Wife.
That Plerwsza had had trouble
with his wife and wanted to get
rid of her was the testimony of
Deputy Sheriff Jeff Hamilton of
Wllkeson, and residents of the
mining community.
Quarrels between the couple
were frequent, said Hamilton. He
testified the husband had spoken
to him about getting a divorce,
saying his wife was "no good."
Oeorge Carll, another witness,
told of having accompanied Pler
wssa to his borne to find the body
of Mrs. Plerwsza lying behind the
stove.
He told or having seen stains

and the girl was declared to have
taken place.
Many of the girl's letters, ln
which she told of her love for
the defendant, were written to
his sister.
Mary Orr has been in attend
ance at court ever since tlie trial
began. She was in the court
room all day Thursday, but last
evening was taken seriously 111.
Orr resumed the witness stand
Friday to continue his side of the
love affair. He insisted that it

wives from tbe local farmers.
I'm- of substitute foods
which contain equal nutritive
value to the more oxnensive
commodities.
The commission met Thursday
evening.
Direct purchase of foods by
parcel post from the fanners was
strongly recommended. It was
suggested that a box of apples
could be bought from a I'uyalluo
valley rancher for 50 cents. The
parcel postage would aaiount to
17 cents to Tacoma. Thus the
total cost to the housewife would
be less than 80 cents on a box of
apple- that the retailers ask $1
for.

descendants, she has her activity
and faculties to a degree that is
wonderful.
She is usually up at 7 In the
morning in the winter, and by
daylight in summer, her daughter
says. sire insists on doing her
own mending, likes to rend the
papers or have thera read to her,
and takes an interest ln what is
going on. She follows the prog
ress of the Kuropean war closely.

"My great-grandmothur lived
to be 98," she says, a little proud
ly, "and I have a sister living In
Vermont who is 88; but I never
heard of anyone else in the family
who was particularly loiiß-llved.
"I can stand In the back door

No amount of coaxing, however,

She worries about everything."

The old lady laughed apprecia

Slate Outlines Case.
The state's theory, as outlined
by Prosecutor Selden, is that on
the night of the killing Plerwsza
and his wife had a ca-nbat, in
which he struck her in the nose,
that she crouched behind the stove
for safety, aud that then Plerwsza
pointed a revolver over the top of
the stove and shot her.
The fate of Plerwsza may rest
on the testimony of E. O Heln
rlch, expert chemist, who has
made a mlnut* examination of the
Pterwßza home.
Through him the state intends
to show that powder mirks on the

ELIGIBLE
TO VOTE
[
About 15 per cent of Tacoma
voters are ineligible to vote on
the army post bond Issue Jan. 6,
because they failed to cast their
ballotts at the last general elec
tion, according to City Clerk Nick
eus Friday.
The registration books at the
city hall will be open until the
night of Dec. 26 —10 days before
the special election — however,
and any person whose Ban* has
been stricken from the books may
re-register before that fine.
Twenty-six thousand tour hun
dreu and fifty-three still are eligi
ble to vote without re-re-,istertng.
Failure of many persons to un
derstand the details of the army
post idea, and the condemnation
of 70,000 acres of land for the di
vision grounds, is tlie only cause
of objection to the .irop-tsitlon,
according to Mayor Fawcjtt. But
the number of objectors is so
small that the bond vote will be
almost unanimously in the affirm
ative, he predicts.
Mayor Fawcett traveled through
the Puyallup valley Thursday. He
says he found the city of Puyallup
unanimously in favor of the army
post coming to American lake.
Some of the residents of Aiderton
are unfamiliar with the details
and have not expressed emphatic |
approval, hut at McMillan the sen-]
titnetit is overwhelmingly in fa
vor of tlie plan and of tier bond
issue.
The Foster-Klelser Advertising
Co. notified Mayor Fawcett Fri-,
day that it would donate adver
tising space on 100 billboards
throughout the city and county for
24-sheet posters urging citizens
to vote for the bonds Jan. 6.

from the E. M. Brown camp, Span

THAT ''MILLION
DOLLAR" IDEA
Fditoy The Times:
The Times' "Million Dollar" idea is indeed all that its BUM im
plies. It is timely and practical, and the subject is exactly in line
with The Times' progressive spirit and keen interest in civic affairs.
No greater Christmas present could we give ourselves than to pre
pare now for a campaign of timely, psychological, appealing advertis
ing with full-page ads in the eastern papers next summer, calling at
tention on their particularly hot and uncomfortable days to our low
temperatures and recreation advantages.
It is necessary to do this if we are to secure the fullest results
from the elimination of the $17..")0 preferential <>n tourist tickets,
which means so much to the whole Northwest.
No greater service could The Times render than hv following up
its Million-Dollar Idea.
Every effort should be made to secure an adequate appropriation
from the legislature for state advertising purposes.
Provision should be made also for an appropriation locally for
Tacoma 'a own work along this li >(-.
If The Times will undertake a follow-up campaign with its char
acteristic energy and aggressiveness, as was shown in its splendid
work in the rate case, there is no question about the results. This is
the time for action. Yours very truly,
