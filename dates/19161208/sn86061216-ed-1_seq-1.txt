DIFFICULT ONE
New British Premier Faces
Greatest Undertaking
of Great Career
^MAKEUP OF CABINET
STILL A MYSTERY
London, Dec. 7.—It is regarded this
afternoon as virtually certain that
David Lloyd George will succeed in
organizing a ministry which will have
the support of a majority in the house
of commons, the labor party having
decided to participate in the makeup
of the new cabinet.
It is said that George Nicoll Barnes,
labor member of parliament for the
Black Friars division of Glasgow and
a privy councilor, and Arthur Hender
son, president of the board of educa
tion in the coalition ministry, will be
members of the cabinet, and that one
of them will sit in the war council.
In addition, It is also said, there are
to be three under secretaryships al
lotted to the labor party.
NATION WATCH E8 CLOSELY.
rpSQ London, Dec. 7.— It having been de
cided definitely that David Lloyd
George will undertake the formation
i. of a ministry, political circles today
were interested chiefly in the person
nel of the new cabinet and the pros
pects of the new premier for getting
together a combination that will have
the support of a majority in the house
of commons.
Few if any of the liberal members of
Mr. Asquith's cabinet are likely to ao
4., cept office under. Mr. Lloyd George,
,t and some of the unionist members
like J. Austen Chamberlain and Lord
Robert Cecil are likely to stand aside.
sM However, it is assumed that at the
conference at Buckingham palace they
assured the new premier of their ben
evolent neutrality, thus making his
if") task much simpler.
Plea For Fair Trial.
I Provincial liberal newspapers like
the Manchester Guardian and the Liv
Stl erpool Post make a plea to the liber
als to give the government a fair
chance, as it is generally assumed that
it is the embodiment of British deter
mination to win the war. According
to one estimate, Mr. Lloyd George can
rely on the support of virtually all of
the unionist members and of seventy
liberals, and hopes to obtain the
backing of the labor members, who
will come to a final decision at a meet
ing today. It is also represented that
Mr. Lloyd George believes he will be
able to offer concessions to the na
,-v tlonalists.
As far as the cabinet is concerned
the new premier has a nucleus in A.
Bonar Law, Lord Derby, Lord Curzon,

the lord chief justice, is likely to join

BYEASTERNDEFEAT
PARIS 8AY8 FALL OF BUCHAREST
8H0WS NEED FOR MORE
ENERGETIC POLICY.
Paris, Dec. 7.—The news of the fall
of Bucharest was received .here with
sorrow and mortification, although it
had been regarded as inevitable since
the battle of the Argechu was lost.
"We. understand perfectly," saya. the
Petit Journal, 'what the Rumanians
are suffering, for we, too, have suffered
the sorrows of invasion. We associate
ourselves all the more with their grief
since we realize with bitterness of
spirit that we are partly responsible
for the catastrophe, which was not due
entirely to the military abilities of the
enemy's leaders."
All of the newspapers say that the
event must be a lesson to the allies
which ought to spur them on to more
rapid and energetic action and above
all to the organized and effective use
of their common resources. The com
mentators, while generally gloomy,
make the point that the Rumanians,
having abandoned Bucharest, have
now a much shorter line which their
armies, having emerged intact from
the claws of the Gengan enveloping
movement, have a goodj
chance of hold
ing until the allies come to their re
lief. But it is agreed that with the
fall of Ploechti there appears no prob
ability of saving the oil fields, which
is considered the worst feature of the
situation.
Some consolation is derived from
Swiss dispatches which report that
notwithstanding the German victories
in Rumania the German hundred-mark
bill fell to eighty francs—the lowest
price since the war—on the Zurich
bourse.
MANY RUMANIANS TAKEN.
London, Dec. 7.—Since the hostili
ties against Rumania began 100,000
Rumanians have been brought to Ger
man prison camps, according to a
Copenhagen dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph Co., quoting the Berlin Lo
kal Anzeiger. The paper attributes
to German military authorities the be
lief that the Rumanians intend to
withdraw to Moldavia, abandoning the
whole of Wallacliia. By this step they
would have only a hundred mile front
to defend. The Lokal Anzelger reports
that prior to Its capture Bucharest
was nearly deserted and the city was
uninjured.
WAR SUMMARY.
The brief dispatches in which the
fall of Bucharest was announced left
in doubt the fate of the armies which
were resisting the advance of the Teu
tonic invaders.
It is assumed in most entente quar
ters, however, that there was no "last
stand" by the Rumanians before their
capital, and such news as has trickled
through from German sources indi
cates that Bucharest was virtually
deserted when the Teutonic forces en
tered it. The city is said to have
been found uninjured.
Military commentators in entente
capitals point to the probability that
the actions just prior to the capture
of Bucharest were fought merely with
a view to delaying the advance of
Field Marshal von Mackensen's forces
and aiding in the escape of the main
body of Rumanians. The capture of
Ploechti, the railway Junction thirty
six miles north of Bucharest however,
may have blocked the retreat of a part
of the Rumanian forces. The city,
moreover Is in (he center of the great
Prahova oil district.
Other liberal members may be
drawn fjrom men such as Sir Freder
ick Cawley, member of the house of
commons from the Prestwick division
of Lancashire, and Sir George Pollard,
member from the Eccles division of
Lancashire, who. although the pub
lic has heard little of them, have done
efficient work in committees. Dr.

TORPEDOING OF
ARABIA LEGAL?
Germany Insists Its Pledge
Has Not Been Violated
Offers Recompense
Washington, D. C., Dec. 7.—Germany,
in a note made public by the state de
partment today contends that the Brit
ish steamer Arabia, sunk in the Medi
terranean on November 6, was in
reality "a transport ship for troops in
the service of the British government
which is to be considered as an auxil
iary warship, according to international
law, and can therefore be treated like
a warship."
The German government's attitude,
however, like that in the Marina case,
is expressed to be one of readiness to
make amends if it be shown that the
submarine commander violated Ger
many's pledges to the United States.
The note, addressed by the Berlin
foreign office to Charge Grew, in reply
to his' Inquiries made on instructions
from Washington, follows:
"Foreign office, Berlin, Dec. 4, 1916.
"The undersigned has the honor to
inform Mr. Grew, charge d'affaires of
the United States of America, in re
ply to the note of the 21st ultimo,
that the Investigation conducted by
the German government concerning
the sinking of the British steamer
Arabia has led to the following re
sults:
"On the morning of November 6 a
German submarine encountered a
large steamer coming from the Corlgo
Straits, one hundred nautical miles
west of the island of Corlgo. The
steamer was painted black and had
a black superstructure and, not as is
otherwise the case with P. and O. line
superstructures, a light color. The
steamer, which was Identical with the
Arabia, was not traveling on the route
regularly used by the passenger steam
ers between Port Said and Malta, as
is made plain on the enclosed map
but was taking a zig zag course to
ward the west, 120 nautical miles
north of that route. This course on
which the submarine passed three
similar steamers at the same spot on
the same morning, leads from the
Aegean to Malta, so that the Arabia
was moving on the transport route
Corigo-Malta, used solely for war pur
poses, according to the experience un
til now.
"The commander of the submarine
further ascertained that tjiere were
large batches of Chinese and other col
ored persons in their national COB
tumes on board the steamer. He con
sldered them to be workmen soldiers,
such as are used in great numbers be
hind the front by the enemies of Ger
many. In spite of the clear weather
and careful observation he did not
perceive any women and children.
"In these circumstances, the com
mander of the submarine was convinc
ed that in the case of this steamer he
was concerned with a transport ship
for troops in the service of the British
government which is to be considered
as an auxiliary warship, according to
international law and therefore can be
treated like a warship. He according
ly considered himself justified In at
tacking the steamer without delay and
sinking it.
"Should the American government
give the official data showing that the
Arabia was at the time of the torpedo
ing an ordinary passenger steamer the
action of the commander would not
have been In accordance with the 'n
structions given him, since these In
structions are now as before in agree
ment with the assurances of the Ger
man note of May. 1916. This wonlt^
then be a case of a regrettable mis
take from which the German govern
ment would promptly draw the ap
propriate consequences."
Officials Silent.
What action the state department
will takp is problematical. Secretary
Lansing refused utterly to comment
on the case today and other officials
were reticent.
Should It be shown that the Arabia
was, as Germany contends, a trans
port. this government probably would
admit the sinking was justified.
If, however, it is shown that the
submarine commander was m'staken
in holding her to be a transport, a most
serious situation will confront the
state department. At the time the
Sussex was sunk Germany was told
that this country could not tolerate
regrettable mistakes."
It may be said that the United
States does not reeard the circum
stances which the German note recites
as showing justification for sinking the
Arabia without warning or as relieving
the submarine commander from estab
lishing the status of the liner.
It may be stated authoritatively that
no Immediate action will be taken. It.
h'nges entirelv on whether the pledges
given in the Sussex case were broken.
The note pobMshed today is not re
garded in Official ouarters as making
out a strong case for Germany.
The note signed by Minister of For
eign Affairs Zimmerman, Is the first
received by the United States since
he assumed the post succeeding Gott
lieb von Jagow.

PORTO RICO BILL
PROMISES FIGHT
DRY FORCES IN CONGRESS WANT
PROHIBITION ORDER IN THE
ORGANIC LAW.
(Special Correspondence.)
Washington, D. C., Dec. 7. —Prohib
ition threatens to become the effective
barrier to passage of the Porto Rican
self government bill this winter. The
house has passed the bill, and the sen
ate committee on Pacific Islands and
Porto Rico has favorably reported it
in modified form, but the "dry" forces
in the senate have demanded that a
prohibitory enactment be made a part
of the new organic law of the islands.
In this proposal, Senator Shafroth, In
charge of the measure in the upper
house, sees possible trouble. Time is
short until March 4 and the "wet" ele
ment is not going to surrender any
more readily than will the "dry" con
tingent. Shafroth says that if the
"dry" clause Is adopted without de
bate in the senate, all will be well. But
if debate gets started, the fight will
mean no legislation.
This Porto Rlcon bill has another
feature—the terms of qualification for
voters—that is causing great uneasi
ness. The house adopted a proviso
that all voters In Porto Rico hence
forth must either pay $3 taxes an
nually or be able to read and write.
As the vast majority of Porto Ricans
are agricultural laborers, without
money savings or property of any
a* IIAWM
kind, and as they have never had and.^?. ™e™bae™^°P« .wl»
do not now have school facilities for
ftny but the most fortunately situated,
this means the refusal of. the ballot
to some 160,000 men who are now
qualified electors. There has been uni
versal manhood suffrage in Porto Rico
for the past eighteen years. Disfran
chisement of what is estimated at 60
to 65 per cent of the present enroll
ment of voters is demanded in this
proviso, as recommended by Governor
Yager.
Porto Rican delegations, the press of
the island and two. or three American
members of the house protested
against the disfranchisement, but tho
house agreed to it by an overwhelm
ing vote.
Prohibition sentiment in Porto
Rico is an unknown factor. In the
unlikely event that the bill should
now become law with prohibition in
cluded, there will be a curious experi
ment in the ability of a northern
people to bring a Latin-American
people to give up its use of alcoholic
stimulants.
As soon as the president had an
nounced to congress on Tuesday his
desire that there be enacted a law
forbidding railroad strikes during of
ficial inquiry into the disputes back of
the strike demands, the "labor group"
in the house began to arrange to meet
the challenge. This group, made up of
eighteen men holding trade union
cards, had as its chairman Represen
tative Keating of Colorado, democrat.
It is probable that the group will
meet with the four chiefs of the rail
road brotherhoods and with the execu
tive council of the American federa
tion of labor, to discuss the terms of
the bill which shall be submitted by
the administration element in the
house. The labor forces will then plan
their strategy.
The trade unions and the railroad
brotherhoods are opposed to compul
sory delay of strikes. They are op
posed to this delay because they do not
want strikebreakers recruited, nor oth
er defensive preparations made by the
companies, during the period of inves
tigation and because during that
period the enthusiasm of the men who
had voted to strike would be systemat
ically sapped by the appeals made to
them to remain loyal to their em
ployers.
The companies gain In their degree
of preparedness to break the strike,
every day the strike Is delayed.
That Is the one bread and butter fact
which drives the labor forces to oppose
the president on this issue.
