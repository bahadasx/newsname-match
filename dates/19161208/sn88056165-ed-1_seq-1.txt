COTTONWOOD, IDAHO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 191«. $1.50 A YEAR.
WILL PUT IN
COLD STORAGE
Local Creamery Company
Plans On Equipping Plant
to Hold Surplus Butter and
Eggs for Highest Prices.
Cottonwood is still on the up
grade and hardly a week passes
but something is undertaken
here that has a tendency to add
matjerial wealth and improve
ment to the town and commun
ity.
The laitest thing projected for
benefit of our community is an
up to date cold storage and ice
manufacturing plant, which will
be Installed during the coming
winter -months in connection with
the local creamery plant.
The directors and stockholders
of the creamery held a meeting
in the city Tuesday forenoon, at
which time a complete report of
the creamery affairs from the
opening of the creamery last
spring down to date was made.
The affairs of the company were
found to be in exçellent condition.
The creamery has done a fine
business since it began to turn
out butter last July and, besides
paying a good price for butter
fat each month, has operated at
a profit and paid off indebtedness
and purchased new equipment
sufficient to increase the par
ralue of the stock more than $5
per share in less than six months.
The need, however, of cold
storage facilities is fully realized
by the directors of the creamery
and at the meeting Tuesday it
was voted to sell part of the re
maining treasury stock and in
stall a modern cold storage plant
and ice machine during the win
ter months and have the same in
readiness for operation early in
the spring. The building for
this new department will occupy
about the same space as the pres
ent creamery and ground will be
broken this week to get the site
in readiness for the new build
ing,
.The new addition to the cream
ery, when complete, will cost
about $4500 and the new equip
ment will enable the creamery
company to hold all of the butter
made during the spring and sum
mer months in cold storage here
until Jate in the year when prices
a r e .materially higher. The
creamery company will also pur
chase eggs from all parts of the
two prairies and hold them in
storage until winter.
The ice manufacturing plant
will Be used in connection with
the ice cream department and
will take the place of the old
time expensive ice house.
Pea Crop Profitable
J. C. Jansen, farmer residing
on Waha prairie, has realized $75
per acre from a crop of peas
grown upon summer fallow land.
Last season Mr. Jansen seeded
45 acres to one variety of peas
and stated yesterday he would
seed 80 acres the coming season
and would use several varities.
Only the regular early season
cultivation is necessary for a
crop of peas. The peas are seed
ed with an ordinary grain seeder
and are harvested with a hay
mower and threshed with a grain
separator. — Wednesday's Trib

Another snow storm is in prog

as if our winter has finally come
to stay. In a short time the

again and sleighing will be of the

Name Wren President
Thomas Wren of the well
known firm of Wren & Greenough
was yesterday elected president
of the Northwest Livestock asso
ciation at a meeting held at the
Bollinger hotel. The election
was held by the directors at 5
o'clock, and a large number of
the association members and
stockmen were in attendance.
D. S. Wallace, vice president
of the association and one of the
men who has been actively iden
tified with the making of the
shows for several years, was
urged to become a candidate for
the presidency, but expressed
his preference to remain in the
ranks and asked that his friends
give their support to Mr. Wren,
whom he regarded as the proper
person to head tee association for
the ensuing year.
In the election of Mr. Wren the
association has secured one of
the most competent executive
officials in the northwest. The
firm of Wren and Greenough for
many years has been engaged in
railroad construction work and
also operates one of the largest
farms and stock ranches in the
Camas prairie country. M r.
Wren has been one of the heavi
est purchasers of pure bred
horses at the auction sales con
ducted by the association and
was elected a member of the
board of directors a year ago.
Following the meeting of the
directors a general session of the
association was held for the pur
pose of discussing matters of in
terest to the members and breed
ers. Plans for the 1917 show
were generally discussed and an
early campaign in the interest of
next year's exposition will be in
augurated.—Saturday's Tribune.
Band Boys Organize
Cottonwood's new band is now
well under way and the first
practice will be held on Sunday
Dec. 17th. At a recent meeting
officers were elected to look after
the affairs of the new organiza
tion and Prof. Shattuck, of Fer
dinand, was employed as in
structor. Eighteen members
now have instruments and
are ready to begin practicing
and this number will be swelled
to about thirty as soon as the
other boys can secure instru
ments. The commercial club
has donated money enough to
pay the instructor for the first
two months and to purchase the
necessary music for starting the
band and the members have no
fears of not being able to keep
the band going after it is once
nicely started.
There are several capable
players among the band members
and it will not be long until the
boys will be able to appear in
public and make a creditable
showing. Hereafter n o more
imported music for Cottonwood
on public occasions, and it is also
highly probable that the starting
of a band will result in a capable
orchestra being started here in
the near future, which will be
another valuable acquisition for
our town.
Mrs. J. V. Baker and daught
er, Vivian, left Monday for Eu
gene, Ore., where they will visit
with relatives for a week or two.
Prof. C. W. Jenkins and fam
ily left this morning for Spokane
where they expect to rent a home
and reside in the future. Mr.
Jenkins has accepted the princi
palship of the Gifford school and
will return to that place next
week to remain until the close of
the school term. Prof, and Mrs.
Jenkins made many friends
while residents of our city and all
wish them the best of success
wharever they may go.

Make Many Improvements

in the east end of town, which
was purchased by the company a

and practically completed and
will soon begin work on the third.
The sheds are all being erected
on concrete foundations and
when the third shed is completed
the company will have à plot of
ground a hundred feet square all

parties acted very generously in
the matter and it was not difficult
to reach a satisfactory agreement
to all concerned.

sham battle.

Bought Land
For Sheep Ranch
Through a deal consumated
last week, Charles Dunham, well
known stockman of Whitebird,
secured of Gus Wright his entire
holdings on the river, something
better than 1000 acres of deeded
land beside leases, etc. This will
give Dunham better than 2800
acres of deeded land. He has
purchased 1400 head of extra fine
Rambouillet sheep of a Montana
party and intends running sheep
upon the Wright ranch and will
probably later dispose of his
cattle and confine his efforts to
the sheep business exclusively, as
he feels wool and mutton are
pretty apt to continue high for
years to come.—Free Press.
