Railroads Place Embargo on
Export Commodities.
Chicago, Dec. 8. The corner in eggs
and other produce appeared to have
been smashed today when prices, al
ready sharply lower, were expected to
tumble still more. Widespread boy
cotts on butter, eggs and produce and
the extension of grain and meat em
bargoes to include practically all food
stuffs were chiefly responsitje.
Kggs were down today 5 cents be
low the high point and butter had de
clined 6 cents a pound. Potatoes,
banished from many tables when
they became a luxury, have dropped 10
to 15 cents a bushel.
Retail prices are expected to follow
the decline in wholesale prices, closely
following the summoning of five hun
dred retail grocers to appear before
the federal grand jury here today.

make thousands of hens on poultry

hands. Wetz himself admitted that he
has "got enough of this."
Boycott Working In K. C.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 8. Altho not
officially effective until Sunday, the

general freight agent of the Erie ex
plained that the order of his road
"even applies to livestock to the ex

GREEK KING VERY ILL

Paris, Dec. 8. The health of King
Constantine is again causing anxiety
according to news from German
sources, says a Zurich dispatch to the

patch says, and has kept constantly
open. The king's condition is said to
be very weak.
Volunteer, National Guard,
Tried and Found Wanting.
PLACE NATION IN DANGER
Less Than Half of Required
Number Rallied to Colors.
State Regiments Were 97,000
Below War Strength.
Washington, Dec, 8. The volnnteer
military system again has proved It
self a failure and should be relegated
to the past, declared Major General
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, in his annual report made pub
lic today. Basing his conclusions on
the showing of the federalized nation
al guard, when mobilized for border
duty, and the fact that strenuous re
cruiting campaigns for both the'regu
ulars r.nd guardsmen have produced
negligible results. General Scott said:
"In my judgment the country will
never be prepared for defense until
we do as other great nations do that
have large interests to guard; like
Germany, Japan and France, where
everybody is ready and does perform
military service in time of peace as he
would pay every other tax and is will
ing to make sacrifices for the protec
tion he gets and the country gets in
returns. There is no reason why one
woman's son should go out and defend
or be trained to defend another wo
man and her son who refuses to take
training or give service. 'The only
democratic method is for every man
in his youth to become tr. ined in or
der that he may render efficient serv
ice if called upon in war."
New Defense Act Inadequate.
Taking up the question of the na
tional guard in ts federal status. Gen
oral Scott declares the training period
of "5 days in three years provided by
the new National defense act is wholly
inadequate.
"In my judgment," re says, "it pre
cludes this force from being n.ade fit
for war service until it has received at
least six months additional training '.n
time of war." -
The report refterates - the opinion
that it takes a year of intensive train
ing to make a soldier and adds that
the country and congress appear to
have a vital misconception of the facts
in this regard. Unless the federalized
CTiard which congress substituted for
the citizen volunteer army advocated
by the general staff can be given
greater training General Scott says the
country faces a serious situation. v
Can't Get Recruits.
"And it is very doubtful." he con
tinued." if we will be able to do so
and keep the force recruited. The
difficulty that is now being expe
rienced in obtaining recruit- for the
regular army and for the National
Guard in service on the border raises
sherply the question of whether we
will he ahle to recruit the troops au
thorized in the national defense act."
In spite of the fact that the pre
paredness agitation stimulated interest
while the effort now being made to
brine the border forces up to war
strength. General Scott asserts, three
months of recruiting left many nation
guard unit still below minimum
strength. Every effort was made to
get the men. he says, a house to house
canvass being conducted in some sec
tions. The failure." says the report,
"should make the whole people realize
that the volunteer system does not
and probably will not give us either
the men we need for training in peace
or for service in war."
75 Per Cent Green Men.
General Scott gives at length sta
tistics on the national guard mobiliza
tion available when his report was
written. September 30. He shows that
in eleven states with 16,600 enrolled
guardsmen, at the time of the call,
more than 10 per cent failed to re
spond and 29 per cent of the re
mainder could not pass required phys
ical tests, making the force 43 per
cent raw recruits when it went to the
border. Brought up to war strength,
he says, the force would have been 75
per cent green men and useless tor
war purposes for many months.
An aggregate force of 151,096 offi
cers and men of the guard were mus
tered into the federal service under the
call and about 110,957 were on the
border a month and a half after the
call was issued. The general corn-
mends' highly the efficiency of the
railroads in handling the mobilization.
Turning to recruiting in the regular
army, the report says that the service
was 29,130 short of its authorized
strength on August 31 last. Between
March 15, when congress authorized
bringing the army up to war strength
by adding 20.000 men and August 31,
only 8,463 additional men were en
rolled. BOMBERS GET 10 YEARS

WATER RATE ROW
City Commissioners Can't Agree
on wland Ordinance.
Upkeep More Important Than
Price, "InsurgentsThinkT-
The first real row between the city
commissioners open to anything but
the four walls of Mayor House's of
fice is pursuing its merry way as a
result of the refusal of three "insur
gent" members of the commission to
pass Commissioner Newland's ordi
nance providing for a reduction in
water rates.
The "insurgents' demand that pro
visions be made for the city's upkeep
of water services before the reduc
tion is made, maintaining that such
action will be of more benefit to the
consumers, ultimately, than the dif
ference of 15 or 20 cents a month in
the size of a property owner's bill.
Commissioner Newland announced
this morning that he would insist
upon the passage of his ordinance.
He expressed a desire to make pro
visions for the city's upkeep of the
services. Yet he will demand that
the ordinance be passed and an in
vestigation made later to determine
whether such action will be possible.
Newland Stands Pat.
"I am in favor of the city upkeep
ing the services," said Commissioner
Newland. "But I want the ordinance
passed first. Then we will investi
gate the proposition and see whether
we can't afford to keep up the ser
vices under the new rates."
Not one of the three ' "insurgents,
Commissioners Porter, Tandy aud
Wasson will consent to the passage of
the ordinance at this time. That was
the announcement made by them this
morning.
"We would be in a nice boat," said
Commissioner Tandy, "if we would
pass that ordinance, investigate and
discover that the improvements, new
wells and other things Commissioner
Newland desires, together with city
maintenance of services would make
it necessary for us to hike the rates.
L-ts provide for the upkeep of the
services first and then learn whether
we can make the reductions made in
the Newland ordinance."
House Is Silent. j
Mayor House won't express his1
views on the proposition for publica
tion. He maintains that such things
should be settled in "star chamber" j
sessions first and then nothing but ;
formal action taken in open meetings. !

Lloyd-George would not have complete
support for his new government in
parliament was swept away today,
when the liberal party members in
conference, formally resolved to sup
port the new regime in the prosecu

The action means Lloyd-George will
not only be backed up by the union
ists and the laborites totaling 324
votes out of the 670 in commons
but also tho liberal block of votes
260 more. The Irish nationalist group
is the only one of any strength now

After the extra payrolls are out, it
will be necessary to verify them and
