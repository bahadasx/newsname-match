OUR CITY con
mmjrn point
In Issue Raised by Mr. Bai
ley Over Lighting
Franchise.'
is our source
said infonna-
The "official organ
of information, hence
tion must be correct.
It seems that some weeks ago Mr.
G. Loper Bailey, a citizen and tax
payer of this municipality and a gen
tleman whose standing in the commu
nity needs no defense from this pa
per, made the point that the present
Palatka Gas Light and Fuel Company
was not carrying out its franchise re-
(luirements, as a result of which state
ment the council held up the bills of
the company for lighting the streets,
j The franchise plainly st.-.tcs (Sec
! tion 5) that "the rates to be charged
j in the city of Palatka for electric
i street lighting purposes shall not ex
ceed the following rates for an all
i night schedule: 2,000 candle power
Slights, $75 per annum; 1,500 candle
j power lights, SOS per annum; 100
' candle power lights $25 per annum;
j 0 candle power lights $22 per annum;
1 00 candle power lights, $21 per an
num; 40 candle power lights, $20 per
annum.
According to the "official organ,"
Aldermen Jarrett stated that afterkin
vestigation he "found that while the
candle power is not the same, the city
is getting better and brighter light
than when Mr. Bailey furnished it."
Alderman Austin it appears "looked
into the matter and to all appearances
it seemed to him that the city was
Hghted brighter than ever before."
Alderman McNally remarked "that
the electric light people have been
mighty nice to us and should be given
credit for the improvements
have made and their EVER READY
WILLINGNESS TO DO WHAT IS
RIGHT."
Mayor Merriam said that "just be
cause an individual wanted to hold
up the bills (for city lighting) was
no reason for the long delay."
President Neck said that "Mr. Bai
ley had called him into his office and
since he kept him about an hour,
showing him a telegram, reading the
contract, etc., he could not remember
all he did say. It was, however,
about electric light, he felt sure."
Now The News submits that the
above is not a very pretty line of talk
for men charged with management of
city affairs to put up when any com
pany engaged in furnishing a public
utility is charged with the non-fulfillment
of its franchise obligations.
Mr. Bailey has charged that the
down town lights are of but 650 can
dle power; that the price charged the
city for these 650 candle power lights
is the same as for 2,000 candle power
lights, when the franchise expressly
stipulates that $65 per year shall be
the price of 1,500 candle power lights.
The power of the light is not Mr.
Bailey's estimate; it is the power de
signated by the General Electric Co.
of Atlanta.
The question at issue IS NOT
WHETHER THE CITY IS GETTING
BETTER LIGHTS THAN WHEN
MR. BAILEY FURNISHED THEM,
but IS THE CITY GETTING WHAT
WAS REQUIRED IN THE FRAN
CHISE OF AUG. 21, 1914?
The Palatka News can also attest
to the affability of the officers of the
new company they have always
"BEEN MIGHTY NICE TO US."
But with all that, business is busi
ness. Is the franchise contract be
ing complied with? Are wo getting
what we are paying for? These are
the questions at issue.
That franchise was talked over
much by the citizens in mass meeting,
and men like J. H. Yelverton, who was
the then president of the council, felt
that at the rates as finally agreed up
on, they made a fair bargain for the
citv.
Mr. Bailey's lights may not have
been as good as the present lights,
but that is an entirely different ques
tion from the one which the council on
Mondav nierht treated so lightly.
The city of Palatka is entitled to
what it pays for just as much as a pri
vate individual would be. If its lig'its
are of 1,500 candle power, ;or less, as
has been charged, then the city council
is paying $10 per year per light more
than the company is authorized to
collect under its franchise.
Mr. Bailev's interest in the matter
is ended by' the action of the council
on Tuesday night. That action re
leased the bondsmen, his friends,
from further liability. His calling at
tention to the delinquency was simply
in the interest of those bondsmen.

Convenience.
The "Lodge of Sorrows."
The annual memorial services of Pa
latka Elks took place in Kaiuneia s
theater last Sunday afternoon and be
fore an audience which filled the
place. ... , .
The program was oeaumui " -
pressive. It included selections uy i"c
orchestra under the direction of Mrs.
E L. Mann, lodge ritual ceremonies
bv officers of the lodge, a beautiful
ly rendered vocal solo, "There is a
Green Hill Far Away." by Miss Ida
Leib, a violin solo by Miss Boyyd. and
addresses by Rev. Dr. Alford and Hon.
E Noble Calhoun. The invocation
was by Rev. Dr. R. L. Bonsteel. and
the benediction by Rev. Dr. C. R. D.
Crittenton. ,
The addresses of Pr. Alford and
Col Calhoun were both intensely in
teresting and master pieces of oratory.
Postmaster Harry Gray is attending
the United States Court in Jackson
ville. Chas. E. Morrrill, Jr., Superintend
ent of Construction. U. S. Public
Buildings, who has had charge for the
government from the first, says:
"Postmaster Gray is in Jackson
ville; if he gets back in time, the
building will be thrown open to the
public for inspection from 7 to 8:30
o'clock Friday night. In case he does
not return in time there will be no
public "reception." We will be at
work in here all day on Saturday,
and the office will be moved on Sat
urday night. There can bo no pub
lic receiving while the men are at
work."
LATER Mr. Gray returned last
night, therefore postoffice reception
will be held this evening from 5 to
8:80.
Mr. Morrell, whose home is in
Marlboro, N. Y., expects to leave Pa
latka by the 20th inst. His work will
be done.
No use The News trying to tell you
much about the new postoffice build
ing. Suffice it to say that it is a
model both in beauty and lasting
qualities. It is convenient, roomy, el
egant. It is fireproof.
The building cost, exclusive of lot
and furnishings, $48,357. Mr. Mor
rell says that when all is in that the
building and furnishings will have
cost an even $54,000. The lot cost
$4,000.
Thp furnishings are the best, and
are ideal.
Over the postmaster's private office
is an office devoted to postoffice in
spectors. This official can step from his of
fice into a little hole and work his
anatomy around a little corner and
come out into a dark, secret passage
which skirts the entire upper floor.
This passage is painted black and
from its walls are several "louvers,"
or look-outs through which he can see
every movement of every person at
work in the office, without himself be
ing seen.
This will be the first time in the
history of this city that we have had
a postoffice in keeping with our dig-1
nity. We have rented places and
have lobbied for locations. The of
fice has been twice on Water street,
in at least two places on Lemon
street, on Second street (in the Crill
building) and for the past 20 years
in the place now being abandoned.
There is a story connected with its
movement into this to-be-abandoned
place that is interesting.
William Patton Anderson was post
master about 1895 and '98. The of
fice was in the Crill building on Sec
ond street. On Lemon street between
Water and Second streets were such
merchants as Loeh, Myer, Kennedy,
Walter Thomas and others. They
saw the people going to the postof
fice and conceived the idea that it
would be better for them if they could
have the postoffice moved to a poim
which would carry the crowds by their
stores. They hatched a scheme, into
which they impressed the Thompsons.
They secured the Thompson site for a
rental of $5 a year, bought the boxes
and furnishings and secured the re
moval. Later, of course the rental
went up, but "Dick" Kirby, who was
appointed postmaster in 1898, says
that the rent for several years was
still $5 per annum "The Thomp
son rented a box that cost them $1
per quarter," said Mr. Kirby, "and
when the box rent was due I used to
receipt the bill and hand them a quar
ter, which sqquared the rent for that
quarter.
The postoffice has been 20 years
in this location.
Postmasters who have served in
Palatka for the past 30 years are:
Benj. Harrison under the first Cleve
land administration, four years; F. A.
Garrison followed and served four
years. Then came the second Cleve
land administration and the appoint
ment of W. P. Anderson who served
four years; following came the admin
istration of McKinley, Roosevelt and
Taft, through all of which 16 years
or four terms Mr. Kirby was appoint
ed. His last term would have ex
pired in May, 1914, but he resigned
in November, 1913, when the present
postmaster, Harry Gray was appoint
ed. Mr. Gray assumed office Janu
ary 1st, 1914.
Being a young man and democratic
in mould and finish, he is liable to
stay indefinitely. Anyway he now
has an office furnished him in which
official life win be rendered more
agreeable.
Death of Mr. Rowlands.
News has been received by friends
in this city of the death Monday even
ing of Mr. Rowland Rowlands, his
death being due to heart failure.
Mr. Rowlands was for upwards of
15 years prominently identified with
the Selden Cypress Door Co. in this
city, making his home here all that
time. A few months ago he moved
to Jacksonville, where he was identi
fied with the Merrill-Stevens Co.
Mr. Rowlands is survived by his
wife and one son, Arthur, whose home
is at Bayonne, N. J., and for whose
arrival the funeral is delayed until
this afternoon, when the body will be
brought to Palatka for interment.
Practical Economy
Baking powders made from alum or
phosphate may be bought for a trifle less
than Royal Baking Powder, which is made
from cream of tartar, derived from grapes.
Alum powders are not only cheap, but
they differ greatly in leavening power.
If a cheap baking powder is used for a
fine cake and the cake turns out a failure
there is a waste of costly materials worth
more than a whole can of the cheap bak
ing powder.
Royal Baking Powder produces the
finest food, and its use therefore, results in
an actual saving.
