guide that influenced our lives for
good. I am glad that when death
will claim her, her children catr
rise up and call her blessed. Never
can we forget the resignation and
fortitude with which she awaited
death; for mother welcomed death.
She did not fear" it. Her life was
one of sacrifice for others. God
bless her memory."

Implement House Burned
Laclede suffered another severe
loss by fire when the big imple

J."W. Moberly was licked up early
last Friday morning. It was first
discovered between 12 and 1 o'clock
by someone in the country south
of town who phoned in to know
what was on fire.
By the time the alarm could be
given and help arrived the fire had
spread to all parts of the building
and not a thingwas saved, r
It contained all the implement
stock, undertaking goods, hearse,
automobile and a large quanity of
timothy and other farm seeds. .
It required the combined effort
of all who turned out to keep the
fire from spreading to nearby prop
erty and it took some hard work
to save the McEfee property, the
same being just accross the ally
from the burned building. The
barn was badly scorched, and on
fire in several places, but hard
work saved it.
The loss is upward of $6,000
with $4,100 insurance.
Nfchols & Son had stored in the
building chairs, caskets boxes and
vaults to the amount of $275.00.
This was a total loss with no in
surance.
