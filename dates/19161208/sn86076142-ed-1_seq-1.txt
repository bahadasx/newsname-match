Br Associated Press.) ' ' ' '
EL PASO, Texas, Dee. M. -Three more names were added to the
list of foreigners who have been killed in Mexico by bandits.
Guillermo Snyman, son of the late General ftnyman of Boer war
fame; Howard Weeks, or Howard Gray, as he was known in
Mexico, and an American named Foster, were the names added
to the death wroll of Villa's banditry. Although they were
believed to have been killed many days ago, the news of their fate
only reached the border today when messages and refugees told
of their demise.
Villa's bandits also wreaked vengeance on Americans in Chihua
hua City by looting many American homes, carrying off large
quantities of American owned property and destroying what they
were unable to haul away, niesKsges received today from the
Chihuahua capital state.
DEPED
The palatial home of Donald B. Gillies, an American mining
operator in Chihuahua, was looted of practically everything it
contained. The piano, a talking machine and even 'tjie carpets were
taken. The family had fled to the border.
Villa was reported to have reached Satevo, 45 miles southwest
of Chihuahua City and 70 miles northwest of I'arral, Tuesday, with
his main command and large quantities of loot from Chihuahua
City, an officer of General Franciseo Gonzales' staff, who accom
panied him from Chihuahua City, said. It was believed at the
capital Villa was going to Parral.
This officer said more than 60 Chinese 'were killed by the Villa
bandits after taking the city, three Syrians were reported to have
been killed and three Mexican women carried away to the
mountains.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 8. New re
strictlons on American trade with
Russia were announced by the Brit
ish embassy in a circular setting
forth conditions to govern shipments
passing through blockade lines Into
Sweden, through which country most
American exports to Russia are
handled. Aside from goods destined
for the Russian government, only 34
commodities can be sent to Russia
under the regulations, and rigid con
dltlons must be complied with before
letters of assurance for the ship
menta will be issued.
The step Is believed here to be
the outcome of a conflict In the
trade policies heretofore followed by
Great Britain, Russia and Sweden

SAN TOY MINE
The Donald B. Gillies referred to
in the Chihuahua dispatch as having
his palatial residence looted was one
of the early managers Identified with
Tonopah mines and was one of the
most lovable characters known to the
mining world. He appeared here
first in company with a number of
mining operators from Montana who
arrived in 1904. These men included
Malcolm Macdonald, Jules Smith, of
the Butler theater, and Louis Park-
burst, who were associated in various
mining ventures in Butte. Gillies
took charge of the Montana Tonopah
and later became general manager
of the Tonopah Extension and Mont
gomery Shoshone after it passed Into
the control of Schwab. In 1908
Gillies was induced to engage his
services to the San "toy, which was
another Schwab promotion, and, al
though the mine long since has
passed the zenith of Its prosperous
period, Gillies remained in Chihua
hua, where he had taken up other
interests.
Since leaving Tonopah, Gillies mar
ried and has two children. Jules
Snilth had a letter from him about
six months ago, but knows nothing
about when he left the southern
republic.

State Department Not Satis
With Explanations and Ma'
Sever Relations
(Br Associated Press )
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. Germany's acceptance of respoi ;
for the sinking without warning of the British line Arabi ,
the explanation that her submarine commander took the ve ,
an auxiliary warship, has brought the issue over submarine
to a more serious and clear cut basis than anything tl
happened since the threat of the United States last April t :
diplomatic relations after the torpedoing of the channt :
Sussex.
Such information as the American government now has 1
show that the Arabia was a passenger ship of the Peninsu
Oriental line, passing through the Mediterranean on a
voyage. Among the passengers was an American citizen, v
rescued. .
The German note, made public yesterday by the state ;
ment, says if official data is furnished showing that the vet
an ordinary passenger steamer, "this then would be a
regrettable mistake." :
In official quarters the German explanation is regarded
and unsatisfactory, no weight being attached to the statenv i
the Arabia was painted like a transport and was following
usually taken by transports, and that the submarine con;
saw many Chinese but no women and children aboard hei
realized, however, that if official data finally establis t
innocent character of the Vessel, in " view of the Sussel
virtually only one court of action remains open to the !'
States, and that would not be taken until every possible cc
tion had been given Germany's position. ;
While Secretary Lansing refused all comment beyond tl
cation of the note, it is known authoritatively that Ge
udmission in the Arabia ease, her similar admission in the
case, when six Americans were drowned, and the early fact
sinking of the American steamer Chemung, have comb;
create much anxiety. The temporary quietude in sxl
operations which followed the pledges in the Sussex case ap
has been dispelled and officials are recalling the beli
unnounced that submarine warfare is "utterly incompati

rights of neutrals and the sacred immunities of non-combat;
