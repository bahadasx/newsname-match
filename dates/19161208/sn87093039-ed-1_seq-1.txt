Returns for Leavenworth Apples
Coming In
The Leavenworth Fruit Growers
Unit has shipped twenty-six cars of
apples and have about four more to
ship. Returns already in have been
sufficient to pay for all paper, boxes and
labels purchased for growers and a
major portion of the warehousing bill
due F. T. Motteler.
On Monday, Dec. 4, the Unit sent
out checks to the growers paying an
advance of 10? per box on all standard
grade apples received at the warehouse
and as the returns have been steadily
coming in the officers of the Unit be
lieve they will be able to complete the
seasons business by the middle of Jan
uary, 1917. An earlier final settlement
was expected but car shortage held up
shipments thus postponing closing of
sales and distribution of receipts to
growers.
Was the Blewett Pass Used ?
Road Overseer Fairish answers the
interrogatory with a statement showing
just how much that important highway
was used during the time the pass was
open to travel. By next season the
road will be much improved. All
grades will be reduced to a maximum
ten per cent. All grades will be
widened and turnouts made at frequent
intervals. Almost six thousand autos
used the road from June to November.

MOUNT VERNON SINGING
PARTY MONDAY EVENING
A Good Entertainment Greeted by a
Large and Sympathetic Au
dience
The Mount Vernon Singing Party,
consistine of three ladies and two gen
tlemen, constituted the second in the
series of four entertainments brought
to Leavenworth this winter by the
Kumtux Club. The Mount Vernon
company proved the strongest vocal
entertainers ever heard in Leavenworth.
The program consisted of selections
from some of the well known operas,
with three plantation melodies and
some Italian character songs. The
audience always wanted more, and got
it in some excellent selections not on
the program.
We congratulate the Kumtux Club
on its happy selection no less than on
the size of the audience.
THE THIRTY MILE TUNNEL
LEAVENWORTH EAST PORTAL
Sounds Like a Pipe Dream But May
Become a Reality -Will Come Be
fore Next Legislature
With a persistence that knows no
such word as fail Gen. Chittenden is
boosting the big tunnel scheme from
Leavenworth to Skykomish He has
addressed a letter to the Wenatchee
Commercial club, and will address a
like letter to every commercial club on
the east side of the mountains asking
for co-operative help and showing that
to scheme is practial and feasible. The
present proposition is to facilitate auto
travel all the year round between the
east and west side of the Cascades.
The whole matter will receive the
serious consideration of the transconi
nental railroads. Seattle is taking a
very deep interest in the proposition.
That the tunnel scheme will also
receive legislative consideration at the
coming session is quite probable.

Inland Empire Highway
According to a story given out for
publication the first of this week by the
forestry department, the public high
ways in eastern Washington are to be
liberally dealt with. The Blewett road
is to get the lion's share of public
money for road improvement the com
ing year, altho the Sunset highway,
from the summit of the Cascade moun
tains east is to get 925,000, while the
road down the Columbia river, kcown
as the north and south Inland Empire
highway is to get $15,000. To make
all the above sums available the state
or county will have to add an amount
equal to the forestry appropriation.
... .fine.nate^ejonqmj^ says that "in
dustrial classes are full of indignation
thai the farmers should be obtaining
such inordinate prices for what they have
produced." Well, we do not know of
any law that prohibits some of these
industrial workers in the cities from en
gaging in farming. But we would remind
them that the eight-hour-day has no
place on the farm.

MAKING NATIONAL EORtST
POPULAR AMONG TOURISTS
Fifteen Thousand from Thirty States and
Twelve Foreign Countries Used
Oregon Forest Last Year
The Eagle Creek camp grounds on
the Oregon National Forest attracted
15,000 visitors from thirty States and a
dozen foreign countries during the out
ing season of 1916, according to T. H.
Sherrard, Supervisor of Oregon National
Forest. This is the first season these
camp grounds have been easily accessi
ble to the public.
The grounds have been developed
under a carefully devised plan of the
Forest Service to make them both at
tractive and convenient to campers and
visitors. Nearly one hundred campsites
with safe fireplaces and other conven
iences have'been prepared. Excellent
water has been piped to the grounds
and a sewer system installed. A public
comfort station is centrally located
where it is accessible from all parts of
the grounds. A short lood road from
the Columbia Highway makes it possi
ble for automobile parties to drive di
rectly to a campsite, thus making the
packing of equipment and supplies un
necessary.
A Forest officer was stationed at the
camp grounds during the season who
assisted visitors in finding a satisfactory
campsite and parking place for their
machine. He saw that a fire was kept
burning in a large concrete stove for
the convenience of transient parties in
making coffee or cooking food without
having to start a fire. A supply of fire
wood was kept ready for visitors use,
and garbage cans were conveniently
placed about the grounds.
Among the fifteen thousand visitors
at these Camping Grounds were parties
from Alaska, Canada, China, England,
France, Germany, Hawaii, Japan, New
Zealand, Scotland, and Switzerland, be
sides thirty of the States of the Union.
In preparing for winter, the pipe
lines have been disconnected and the
comfort station locked. The tent oc
cupied by the ranger as a temporary
headquarters has been taken down.
It is planned to build a permanent
ranger station on the grounds the com
ing season.
A topographic survey of the grounds
has just been made, and a large number
of new camp sites on the west side of
Eagle Creek are planned. An automo
bile bridge across the Creek is part of
the plan to make the new campsites
more accessible
The trail up Egale Creek has been
completed for four and a half miles to
a bridge site a mile and a half above
Punch Bowl. Here a bridge will be
built 50 feet long and 125 feet above
the Creek. It is expected to complete
this trail to Wahtum Lake next season.
The excellent cooperation of visitors
in keeping the camp grounds in a neat
and attractive condition is appreciated
by the Forest officers who have charge
of the grounds.
Because rmblic camping grounds of
this sort meet a real need, says Mr.
Sherrard, the Forest Service is planning
to develop several suitable sites on the
National Forests of Oregon and Wash
ington in 1917. According to present
plans, a camp ground near Rockdale
on the Snoqualme Forest will undergo
the most extensive development next
year.
Shafroth, democratic senator from
Colorado, introduced a resolution call
ing for a constitutional amendment
abolishing the electoral college, but not
abolishing the electors, and yet provid

years and be ineligible to re-election.
The amendment also provides that
congress meet in annual session on the
first Tuesday in January.

Davenport to Have Woman for Mayor
According to the Lincoln County
Times Davenport is to have a woman
for mayor. The men have lost interest

is urged by the women to make the
race, "The men won't do anythig,
and the dry law in not being enforced.
We women want to arouse some
sentiment and we want to run Daven
port on a better and cleaner basis.
FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT
OfFICES, WHERE LOCATED
Employer and Employee Urged to Make
Use of Free (..formation
The United States government em
ployment service, which maintains per
manent offices in all of the principal
cities thruout the state, desires to an
nounce to the public that the work of
furnishing information and directing
labor in connection with the harvesting
of the seasonal crops has brought the
service in close touch with the labor
ing classes, and, therefore, are now
able to furnish labor to employers with
out delay. —Henry M. White, Commis
sioner of Immigration.
It is the aim of the employment ser
vice to minimize, as far as possible,
unemployment during the winter, and
upon receipt of an application from an
employer prompt attention will be
given and special effort made to direct
only the class of help desired.
During the past eleven months, be
ginning January Ist, 1916, and ending
November 30th. 1916, the government
employment offices in the State of
Washington found employment for ap
proximately 28,000 persons. This
does Dot include several thousand who
called at the offices for information re
garding industrial conditions in some
other part ol the state or of the United
States.
Many applications are now on file
from men seeking employment as la
borers, farm laborers, saw mill men,
loggers, wood cutters, land clearers,
milkers, carpenters, painters, black
wraiths, cooks, in fact, all classes of
labor, skilled or unskilled. The gov
ernment employment service is free to
both employer and employe. Any em
ployer desiring help is invited to call

A Tempest in the Legislature Over Speak
ership—Can the Granger Favor
the Closed Shop?
The coming session of the state legis
lature will be asked to consider the
problem of reclaiming the logged-ofi
lands of the state. Among the proposals
that probably will be submitted to the
legislators is a provision for the state to
purchase non-agricultural lands and re
forest; the establishment of agricultural
districts to aid farmers in land clearing
by the purchase of powder; a change in
the taxation system by constitutional
amendment, and the loan of state funds
for developing logged-off lands along
plans similar to a law recently enacted
in Oregon and for some time followed
in British Columbia.
Conference on this subject is arrang
ed for this week at the University of
Washington, when members of the
legislature, representatives of commer
cial bodies, labor organizations and
women's clubs will consider this pro
blem. A bill has already been drawn,
which is to be discussed at this con
ference, that provides for the loan by the
state of not more than 81,000 to settlers
on logged-oB lands.to be repaid within
ten to twenty years with interest at 6 per
cent and the establishment of agricultu
ral districts to be in charge of county
officials and details administered by
county agricultural experts.
Announcement that representatives
of the King county granges are consider
ing the proposition of perfecting a plan
for affilition with the labor unions of
Seattle, by maintaining delegates in the
Central Labor Council, is causing con
siderable discussion and speculation as
to its practicability. For some time a
representative of the King county
granges has had a seat in the Central
Labor Council without a vote, the pur
pose being to promote closer relations
between the organizations. In view of
the fight that the labor organizations in
Seattle are making for the closed shop
in this state and the activities of the I.
W. W., an unaffiliated organization, but
which has the active sympathy of the
labor council, in trying to organize the
farm laborers in various sections of the
state, it is thought ihat the scheme to
establish a cooperative working agree
ment between the farmer and labor or
ganizations is likely to meet with serious
difficulties and considerable opposition.
Many farmers can see nothing but
additional perplexities and trouble il the
closed shop movement is extended to
larm labor. The labor problem on the
farms, particularly during harvest sea
sons, has increased tremendously in re
cent years and it is feared that the
farming industry would serve only to
greatly augment the trouble already
experienced.
The Uinversity of Washington foot
ball squad won its ninth consecutive
championship of the Northwest by de
feating the University of California team
on Thanksgiving day by a score of 14
to 7. The record is remarkable in foot
ball annals and is considered a signal
tribute to the coaching ability of Gil
more Dobie, the football wizard of the
Washington University. Dobie started
his coaching career in 1905 as mentor
for a Minneapolis high school team.
In 1906 and 1907 he coached the
Noith Dakota Agricultural College
squad, and came to the University of
Washington in 1908. Throughout that
time he has never suffered a defeat and
his teams have been held to but three
tie games.

sion of the legislature will probably be
asked to pass a law providing for such
supervision. Dr. W. H. Slingerlau.
special agent ol the Russell Sage Found

discussion. The 1917 convention will
be held at Helena, Mont.
Since it has become apparent that G.
E. Kelly of Tacoma has secured enough
pledges to insure his election as speak
er of the next house of representatives
of the state legislature, E. H. Guie of
of Seattle, an unsuccessful aspirant for
the position, has made public a letter
condemning the present method of or
ganizing the house and declaring his
support of Representative E. E Halsey
of Asotin county for speaker. Mr. Guie
was a member of the last house and a
part of the dominant oirinization.
While his letter has precipitated con
siderable discussion of house rules and
aroused interest as indicating a possible
attempt to cause a break in the organi
zation of that body, it is not thought at
all likely, by those acquainted with the
situation, that Mr. Kelly's selection as
speaker is endangered by this incipient
revolt. Mr. Kelly is aligned with the
same forces that effectively kept down
appropriations two years ago and who
are working to the same end this year.
Earlier in the year Mark Reed, rep
resentative from Mason county and one
of the state's most substantial business
men, was frequently mentioned in con
nection with the speakership position.
Prior to becoming a candidate for
that place, Mr. Kelly tendered his sup
port to Mr. Reed. The latter refused,
however, to consider it. While an
acknowledged leader in the house, Mr.
Reed has no personal political ambition,
and consents to take the time from his
many affairs solely that he may be of
service in promoting sane constructive
legislation and also prevent the waste
ful expenditure of state money through
ill-advised appropriations and freak leg
islation. Mr. Kelly represents this same
viewpoint and promises to work this
year, as he did two years ago, for a re
cord of economy and a sound policy
of legislation.

ENGLISH CABINET CHANGE
Asquith, Premier Eight Years, Down and
Out—Lloyd George Will Try
His Hand-
The war has not been prosecuted with
the vigor expected by the people of
England and a change had to come.
Whether Mr. Lloyd George can form
a cabinet that will meet with the sup
port of all the elements in the govern
ment remains to be seen. One thing
is certain the English public want more
results for the money they are spending
on the war. Also it is said there is
grave difference of opinion among the
allies about where the war should be
prosecuted with the greatest vigor, on
the French front or en the Saionica
front. Lloyd-George favors the Saionica
front. While the allies are scrapping
among themselves the Germans de
voted all their war energies to subdue
ing Ramania and seem to have suc
ceded in capturing the Rumanian
capitol. The allies prosecution of the
war has been a succession of blunders.
But for their practically inexhaustible
fund of men and money the German;
would long since have whipped the
whey out of the allies. The conduct cl
the French is the one bright spot in
the whole allied mess.
