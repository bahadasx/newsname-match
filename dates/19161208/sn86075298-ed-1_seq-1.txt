RAILWAY BILLS TO
GET FIRST PLACE
Washington, Dec. 4.-Speaker Clark
and Representative Kitchin, majority
leader of the house, assured President
Wilson at the White House confer
ence that they would do all they could
to hasten the passage of railroad leg
islation at the short session of con
gress, which begins today.
The president, after his return from
New York, summoned the house lead
ers to talk over with them the legis
lative program and to secure their co
operation in expediting important
measures.
Legislation to supplement the Adam
son railway wage law, he said, was of
utmost importance and he asked that
this be given precedence in consid
eration over all other general legisla
tion.
Realizing that three months is a
short period for consideration of gen
eral measures when appropriation
bills also must be passed, the presi
dent asked the house leaders if they
thought there would be time for en
actment of new railroad laws before
March 4. Both told him they thought
there would be and promised to exert
every effort to economize time on oth
er matters.
Speaker Clark reminded the presi
dent that congress would have to pay
strict attention to business and asked
him to help at the outset to eliminate
the usual two weeks holiday recess.
Proposed embargo legislation and is
sues raised by the high cost of living
were not mentioned at the conference.
In the opinion of the house leaders,
however, the subject is bound to de
mand attention of congress.
Embargo legislation could not be
passed in the house, Representative
Kitchin declared.
Mr. Wilson will follow his custom
of going before congress personally to
read his annual message.

ROUMANIAN DEFENSE
TIGHTENS; FOES NEAR
London, Dcc. 4.-Roumania still
holds the center of interest in the
world war. The encircling movement
of the Tentonic allies continues to
draw closer toward her capital, Bu.
charest, although the Roumanians ap.
parently are stiffening their defense.
At one point the invaders are in can.
non range of the city.
The Teutons have crossed the Ar
gechu river west of Bucharest, but
both Petrograd and Bucharest assert
that southwest of the capital, the Rus
sians and Ron manians fighting togeth
er have forced the retiremee t of. the
Tentonia and taken teri 'oner and booty.

The Italians are claiming an ad
vance of 300 meters over a front of

Italian line.
Unofficial advices from Athens are
that the fighting there between
Greeks and entente troops has ceased
and that the entente troops have been
sent back to Piraeus.

FOR INDIAN LANDS
FANCY PRICES PAID
The sale of Indian lands at the
Agency last Friday was the most suc
cessful of the many so far held on the
reservation. Bids galore were re
ceived by mail and many more were
handed in by those who attended the
sale in person. The latter were largely
in the majority and all were intent up
on securing one or more of the tracts
offered.
In all, 97 pieces of land were offered
for sale and for these 165 bids were
filed. Fifty-six of the 97 offered
were sold, the average price being
$25 per acre. Several tracts of graz
ing land were included, thus reducing
the average price of farm lands. The
highest price paid for any one tract
was $4,020 for an 80-acre tract near
Flathead townsite, six miles north of
Ronan. Bidders on an average paid
about 50 per cent above the appraised
value. The sale aggregated $110,000.
Another sale, so it is announced, will
be held some time in February, 1917.
BIG DEMAND FOR FOODS
CA¶SE OF HIGH PRISES
The present high prices for all kinds
of food supplies can readily be traced
to the enormous demands coming from
the countries engaged in the great
European war. Prosperity in the
United States, or the alleged prosper
ity, owes its origin to this cause and
not to any act of this or that adminis
tration. American farmers now re
ceiving the highest price known for
their products can unquestionably
credit the European war with being
the cause. They can also charge the
exhorbitant prices they pay for all
manufactured goods to the same source.
An embargo on food stuffs would with
out question reduce the price of wheat
and all other cereals, but would it re
duce the price of the products of the
steel and iron mills and the output of
the big factories of the east? An em
bargo on all exports would reduce the
price all around and put the United
States on a normal footing.
As an indication of the great demand
for foodstuffs from foreign countries,
the following official report shows the
quantities of provisions used by the
Germans alone from February 16 to
Sept. 30:
Rye, 1,051,587 tons; wheat, 160,890
tons; rye flour, 608,185 tons; wheat i
flour, 189,549 tons; rye bran, 32,474
tons; wheat bran, 24,458 tons; mixed'
bran, 757 tons; oats, 3,169,827 tons; bar
ley, 24,797 tons; hay, 17,141 tons; straw,
11,080 tons; heads of cattle, 1,469,248;
hogs, 1,412,673; sheep, 909,253; beef,
2,386,512 pounds; pork, 3,873,286
pounds.
The total cost of these colossal quan
tities of food stuffs and fodder was
over $750,000,000.

GUILTY OF MURDER
IN SECOND DEGREE
The jury in the trial of Miss Edith
Colby for the murder of A. C. Thomas
at Thompson Falls, returned a verdict
Wednesday of 'guilty in the second
degree" and fixing her punishment at
from 10 to 12 years in the penitentiary
at Deer Lodge. The trial lasted eight
days and commanded intense interest.
Miss Colby's plea of insanity failed to
find favor with the jury and she will
now be called upon to partially pay the
penalty of her crime.
After the verdict had been returned
Miss Colby made the statement that
"we have just begun to fight." "I
would not mind taking a sentence,"
she said, "if other guilty ones were to
go with me." In her opinion, Ains
worth, charged as being responsible
along with Miss Colby and others, for
the murder, will never be tried. At
torney Wheeler of the prosecution says
he feels that justice has been done,
while Attorney Mulligan of the de
fense says he was double-crossed.
County Attorney Parks is looking for
the "master hand" behind the scene.
After all is over, it looks as though
justice had been partially meted out,
but from all the evidence introduced at
the trial it to hard to believe that it
was anything but a premeditated and
cold blooded murder, demanding the
extreme penalty.
LOOKS VERY ENCOURAGING
FOR RONAN WATER SUPPLY
Mayor J. A. Lemire, Engineer Earl
D. Covell and J. B, Bear made a trip
to reclamation headquarters at St. Ig
natius last Monday to interview Super
intendent Crowe regarding a water
supply for the town of Ronan, Mr.
Crowe went over the matter very thor
oughly with them and at the end of the
interview informed them that he would
be pleased indeed to assist the people
of Ronan in every way in securing the
desired permit from the government
for an abundant water supply for the
town, and that it would be his pleasure
to recommend the application. Not
alone for the water, but for the grant
of apowersite. Both can be handled at
the same expense as the water alone.
By the time this issue of the
paper is out the application will
undoubtedly be on its way to
Washington, bearing the approval and
endorsement of Superintendent Crowe,
With no objection from the reela
rnation department, the hermit should
be granted without delay, and if the
people of Ronan take the proper steps
immediately, work on the water and
light plant should be under way in the
early spring. Let's get hus''.

CASHING IN ON WHEAT
GETlING GOOD PRICES
The high prices being paid for wheat
is stimulating the movement of that
commodity, and the farmers of the
reservation are busy hauling their
grain to Dixon and Perma to market
it. The movement is so great that
both elevators at Dixon have been
compelled to run 24 hours a day and
are scarcely able to handle the grain
cv ,n then.

taking advantage of the $1.60 to $1.65
prices that have been prevailiug and
consequently are feeling very prosper

The yield on the reservation this
year, while not in most instances re
markable, was uniformly good, and
with the high prices existing, has given
this section a good boost. Prices for
land are rapidly advancing and extens

which, with the railroad now being
built, fully justifies the belief that at

BANDIT LEADER
QUITS CAPITAL
Juarez, Mex., Dec. 4.-Villa and his
bandits, having looted Chihuahua
City, have left for Western Chihuahua
following trainloads of booty.
The reoccupation of the city by Car
ranza forces was announced in a tele
gram received by General Francisco
Gonzales, brigade commander here,
from General Ozuna.
No Americans have been killed in
Chihuahua City by Villa, according to
a private message received from that
city. The message said that the only
foreigners to suffer were the Chinese,
for whom the bandits showed no
mercy.
Many Villa followers, left behind,
when the bandits started for the hills,
were pardoned by Carranza officers
when it was learned they had been
pressed into service by the outlaw
leader.
The forces of General Carlos Ozuna
were the first to re-enter Chihuahua
City and later General Francisco Mur
guma reached the capital after defeat
ing a Villa column thirty miles south
of the city.
Telegraphic communication with
Chihuahua City over the federal line
has been re-established. Communica
tion also has been re-established with
Torreon and Mexico City from the Chii
huahua capital and the railroad has
been repaired, trains operating as far
south as .iminez.
General Gonzales announced he will
go to Chihuahua City with a part of
his brigade as soon as transportation
can be arranged. The fear of Villa
coming to Juarez apparently has
passed.
Six Carranza soldiers from the rem
nant of Trevino's command were seen
on the streets here with their ears
cut. Officers were said to have been
even more terribly mutilated by the
bandits.

RUSSIAN PREMIER
HOOTED IN DUMA
Petrograd, Dec. 4.-When Premier
Trepoff mounted the tribune in the
duma to read a government proclanma
tion members of the Socialist and La

Onstration that the premier was un
able to speak for a quarter of an hour.
Three times M. Trepoff appeared on

forced him to leave.
Finally the president of the Duma
proccured the adoption of a proposal
that twelve members of the two par
ties, including their leaders, be ex

This demonstration is taken to mean
that final settlement of the dispute be
