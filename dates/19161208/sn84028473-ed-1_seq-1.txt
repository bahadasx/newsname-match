A NON PARTISAN SUGGESTION
One of tho great surprises of tho
recent election was tho race made by
Cnnntn Atlnn Pnmnrnne PcrhaDS
Senator Pomereno himself was not
surprlsed but tho political prophets
wllto had consigned nun 10 iuu uuotui
ity of private life havo not recovered
fm hn clinrtr mlrnlniHtnrpil hV tbO
official figures The Senator seemed
iby his independent course 10 uuvu at
tracted the opposition of factions
which arc supposed to bo very power
ful in Ohio politics Even within hla
own party as shown by the primary
vote he had apparently failed to
arouse enthusiasm There wero sorao
who wero unkind enough to say that
President Wilson was maintaining uiu
vacancy In a Federal judgeship in
vniiirn niiin that Senator Pomereno
might find comfortable sanctuary aft
er defeat
The rest Is hlBtory Evidently tho
people of Ohio liked Senator Pomer
enos otc on questions of foreign pol
icy on the prohibition constitutional
amendment on tho Inclusion of labor
unions within tho operation of tho
Sherman law That would seem to
be the significance of Senator Pomor
enos ability to secure approximately
jonnn nr a vntps than the successful
Domocratic candidate for Governor
Senator Pomerene ny nis success at
the polls has become a truly national
figure Why would it not be aprop
rlato for his fellow senators to elect
him President pro tern 01 weir ooay
thereby conferring the party leader
ship upon him The Times Star op
posed Senator Pomereno for re-election
The suggestion is therefor made
without partisan consideration Tho
State of Ohio having highly honored
ono of her sons would appreciate rec
ognition of his good qualities by bis
collcaugues Clncinantl Times Star
