Catching Bootleggers
D. L. Dixon, constable of the 14th
District, had some bootlegging ex
perience last Saturday night. He had
been informed that a regular trade
in whisky shipped to Guys was on by
leggers who got it and carried it to
Corinth for sale. The law of Missis
sippi does not allow but one quart
every 15 days. This did not meet
the demands of the customers, hence
they ship to Tennessee points and
. carry through by hand or vehicle.
Mr. Dixon was satisfied that a narhv
of two negroes, Ben Chester and
Charley Chenault, were on their way
down the M. & 0. R. R., so he lay in
wait just at the line across Blue Cut.
They came along with a grip full of
liquor. He took them in and on the
way to Corinth one of them drew a
bottle when his head was turned, and
struck him a severe blow on the left
.temple, cutting with the glass the
left side of his head and face severe
ly. As soon as he was nn from tha
stun he winged one of the negroes in
fleshy part of the thigh and one shot
in the calf of his leg. The other es
caped in the darkness. The wounded
one he took to the Corinth jail.
When transgressors of the law
think they can fool Dixon they are
badly off.

MRS. CASON HAD NO
"HOPE OF RETURNING
Went to Atlanta 6 Weeks Ago
Propped Up on Pillows. Takes
Tanlac and Gains 35 Pounds
A short time ago Mr. J. H. Battle,
who ia well known in , Atlanta, came
into Jacobs' Pharmacy to get a bottle
of Tanlac for his sister-in-law, Mrs.
0, C. Cason, who lives some distance
out of Atlanta, near Ackworth. While
making the purchase, Mr. Battle told
of the wonderful improvement in Mrs.
Cason's condition since she began us
ing the medicine about six weeks ago.
He also made the statement that
Mrs. Cason felt so grateful for the
wonderful benefit she had received
that she wanted to make a public
statement, as she felt it her duty to
tell the whole world about Tanlac.
He then suggested that Dr. Elder,
the Tanlac representative at Jacobs',
call at his residence for a personal
interview.
When Dr. Elder called at Mr. Bat
tle's residence on English avenue, the
following morning, it happened that
Mr. Bailie himself met him at the
door and very cordially invited him
into his living room. Mrs. Cason, who
was bright and happy, soon made her
appearance and began with delight to
tell of the wonderful recovery of her
health, and her statement wiJl go
down in history as being one of the
most remarkable ever given a propri
etary medicine. Here is the story in
her own words:
"About six weeks ago I left my
home on our farm near Ackworth,
Ga., to come to my sister's home here
in Atlanta, and I left with only a
shadow of hope of ever returning
alive to my home and husband.
"I left Ackworth," she continued,
"in a comfortable automobile, propped
up on pillows, coming through the
country. m I had almost as much med
icine as I had baggage a box full of
all kinds of medicines that had been
prescribed for me. I reached here
very weak and exhausted and with
scarcely enough strength to walk to
the door. This trouble, from which I
had suffered so long, had reduced me
to almost a shadow, as I only weighed
GO pounds. ' ,
"My brotber-in-law, Mr. Battle, said.
'You have tried everything else with
no relief, now I want you to lay aside
your drug shop" and take Tanlac'
Of course I was willing to try it, for
the medicine is the talk of the whole
country. Well, he got it for me and
I started on my first bottle that day.
"When I had taken about half of
the first bottle I began to feel
stronger and encouraged. - I contin
ued to take it, and it is nothing short
cf marvelous how I improved day by
day. I felt myself further and fur
ther from the grave. My appetite
returned and my food seemed to nour
ish me and agree with me. My vc
and complexion began clearing up
and I improved in every way possible
until I am now a well woman, and
when I say well I mean absolutely
what I say. I want to tell the 'whole
world that I thank God and Tanlac.
"I weigh 95 pounds now and feel
as well as I ever felt in my life.
am going back to my husband and
home on the little farm five miles
from Acworth tomorrow, and won't it
be a joyful meeting, returning to my
husband and home absolutely well and
happy and won't I tell everybody
about what Tanlac has done for me?''
"Yes, it's just like she says,'
chimed in Mi. Battle about this tirue
"Tanlac has simply robbed the grave,
and if you could have seen her when
she started in on this medicine, you
would aay the same thing. I didn't
know at the time what her trouble
was, but the doctors said she had pel
lagra. She may have had it, for all I
know, but there is one thing certain,
she hasn't got it now, or at least vou
wouldn't think so if you could watch
her eat. I told her, jokingly, the
other day, that she was eating me
out of house and home. I don't guess
there ever was a case like hers, and
there is one imng certain, you can
count on us telling everybody about
it, because I fully believe she owes
her life to this medicine."

A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
, We are anxious to seeUhat rall lines owned by
other parties and connectedvhh us are kept in such
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are responsible for their upkeep,
we want to co-operate with them.
Alllines require a- thorough overeauling occa
sionally if the best service is to be obtained. Wc
recommend that every line connected with us be
overhauled at least once a year, and that at least one
experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
cost of this work when divided among all the patrons
of the line, makes the amount paid by each man
small, and this cost will be more than offset by the
improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in this sec
tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We will gladly do
what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your line.
