Devotes Most of His Address to1.!
Sixty-fourth Congress to
Question.
Washington, Dec. 6.?President
Wilson's address at the opening of 1
the session of congress today was 3
wholly devoted to domestic subjects, <
principally the problem of railway 1
legislation. 1
In the hall of the house with '
senators and representatives assem- '
bled in Joint session, President Wil- <
son, in accordance with the custom <
ho began at the opening of his term, 1
read his addr??n tmm '
??vtu IUC VIC1A 9 '
desk.
The president not only renewed his 1
recommendation for legislation to ?
prevent a nation wide railway strike
or lockout before there has been op- 1
portunity for investigation, but de-ji
fended it against the attack of or-il
ganized labor as nothing arbitrary 1
or unjust and the "justifiable safe- guarding
by society of the neces- ?
sary process of its very life."
Aside from recommendations for
the passage of file Puerto Rico gov- |1
ernment bill, the corrupt practices',
bill and the Webb bill to legalize i
American collective selling agencies 1
abroad, the president's address was
v i
devoted wholly to the railroad situa-j1
tion. The only feature which had i'
not been forecast was the elimina-d
tion of the proposal that congress^
give explicit approval to consideration
by the interstate commerce commission
of an increase in freight
rates to meet additional expenditu-es '
by the railroads caused by the opera-J
tion of the Adamson law.
No l>ouht of Power.
' Tod-y the president took the pnsi-'1
tion that "the power of the inter-t -te
commerce commission to grant an inriCse
of rates on the ground refer-1
red to is indisputably clear and s- 1
recommendation by the congress
with regrad to such a matter might
seem to draw in question the scope
of the commission's authority or its'
inclination to do justice when there
is no reason to doubt either."
The other recommendations on the)
i
railroad situation made in a special
message during the last session,
which were not put into law, were re i
newed today. They include; j
"Immediate provision for the en
largoment and administrative reorganization
of the interstate com- '
merce commission along the l!n< ?
embodied in the bill recently passed
by the house of representatives and j
now awaiting action by the senate; in (
order that the commission may be ,
enabled to deal with the many great
and various duties now devolving
upon it with a promptness and thoroughness
which are. with its present
I 1
constitution and moans of action.,
piactlcally impossible.
"An amendment of the existing 1
federal statute whiteh provides fro ,
the mediation, conciliation and arbitration
of such controversies as th? (
present by adding to it a provision (
that, in case the methods of acconi
modatlon now provided for should. '
fail, a full public investigation of tin
merits of every such dispute shall be
instituted and completed before .
strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted.
"The lodgment in the bands o.
the executive of the power, in cas*
of military necessity, to take coat
of such portions of such rolling stock
of the railways of the country as nnv
be required for military use and to
operate them for military purposes,
with authority to draft Into military
service of the United States such
train crews and administrative otti
cials as the circumstances may require
for their safe and efficient
use."
'die Biggest Problem.
The renewed recommendation for
compulsory investigation of labor
disputes on railways before strikes
or lockouts are allowed, which h
aroused the opposition of the railroad
brotherhaods, and of the
American Federation of Labor, v.

Coup .of Women Planned to 1
Draw Attention of Congress
to Suffrage Issue.
Washington Hon R ?prooi,ioni
Wilson's address to congress today
was marked by a woman suffrage
coup in the galleries?the first real
show of organized militancy in the
capital?and by a great demonstration
of congratulation to the President
upon his re-election, in which
many Republicans joined with the
Democrats.
After acknowledging the prolonged
cheers and applause which
greeted his entry to the hall of the
House, the President had launched
into his address, reviewing recommendations
for railroad legislation,
the Corrupt Practices Act and
passed to his recommendations for
a broader government for Porto Rico.
He was just about to begin the sentence:
"The present laws governing
the island and regulating the rights
and privileges of its people are not
just," when over tne rail of tiio gallery.

the situation at a glance, smiled (

SMITH IN CLASH
WITH MARSHALL
WILL PUSH HIS BILL
Plans to Press Measure, Holding

Washington, Dec. 6.?A sharp paslage
at arms took place in the senite
today between Senator E. D.
ItnUh Q ?? " * - ?
\?i ouuiii Carolina and Vice
President Marshall, president of the
senate, while the latter was In the
chair because there was a misunderstanding
concerning bringing up the
Immigration bill. Senator Smith had
given notice yesterday that Immediately
upon the conclusion of the
present unfinished business, ht
would move that the senate proceed
to the consideration of the immigration
bill. It has been the custom of
the senate when a notice of this kind
is given to have it printed on the
front page of the calendar of business
?ach morning until action is taken.
This morning the calendar had no
such notice. Upon inquiry at the
clerk's desk, the senator was informed
that by order of the vice
president the notice had not been
printed.
Immediately the senator rose in his
place and asked th * vice president if
the order to leave the notice off applied
to the immigration bill alone,
or if the ehair intended to make this
i permanent rule, excluding fro r
now on all snob notices from the
frontTof the calendar. The vice president
said that was bis intention.
Senator Smith said that the reason
why he had called it to the attention
of the senate was that he did not
propose to allow the impression to go
out that this rule had been changed
because it referred to the immigration
bill. Before taking hi*s seat
Senator Smith irfo-med the serrate
that if the present unfinished business
should Indicate prolonged dohate,
he intended to move that the
senate proceed to consideration of
his hill, the unfinished business notwithstanding.
that he had a richt to
rlo this because it was tire clear tin
rterstanding of the Democratic caucus
before the adjournment of the
last session that the immigration bid

upon the reconvening: of congress this

Senator Smith informed The
State's correspondent that lie was determined
to Ret the bill up either tomorrow
or as soon as he can do so
"It will he remembered." he said,
"that just before we adjourned it:
September there was an understandiiiR
that if I would not press the im
migration bill at that time it would
be taken up immediately upon the
reconvening of congress. We have
reconvened and 1 shall see that the
agreement entered into is strictly
kept."

WITH OUT; PREMIERSHIPJFERED

?
Yisis in Hritish Cabinet iCulminates
in Resignation
of Asquith.
London, Dec. 5.?Herbert H. Asuith
tonight resigned the British
remiership, which he had held
trough eight stormy years of domesc
and foreign history, and the govrnment
crisis found a solution
hlch had been considered the least
robable of practical alternatives.
The Unionist leader, Andrew
uuar liiiw, was summoned to tbe
alace immediately after Mr. Asuith
had departed, and the King
ffered him the prime minister's
ammission. which he had just acjpted
from Mr. Asquith's hands.
No announcement regarding Mr.
onar Law's decision has yet been
lade and there are some doubts
hether he will accept the heavy reponsibility.
If he declines, it is condered
certain the honor will fall to
avid Lloyd-George.
The continuation of the coalition
abinet, with some changes, and th$
peeding up of the war management
ould be the policy in either event.
Day of Excitement.
The premier's decision to resign
nd advise the King to summon Anrew
Bonar Law to form a cabinet
as taken after a day of. extraordinry
political excitement. There were
onstant comings and goings of th?
oliticai leaders between Downing
treet and the government departlents.
Mr. Asquith consulted with
feveral Unionist leaders, including
larl Curzon, Lord Robert Cecil and
ic Earl of Derby.
Noticeable absentees from this
[inference were A. J. Balfour, who is
1, Andrew Bonar Law, J. Austen
hamberlain nr.d Walter Hume Long.
In the afternoon the premier met
is supporters, including Viscount
rey, Lewis Ilarcourt, Edwin S.
lontague,. the Marquis of Crewe,
eginald M< Kenna, Walter ltunellan.
Lord Buehmaster, 11. Samuel,
,ord Reading and Arthur Henderson,
t is supposed Mr. Asquith explained
hat he was forced by almost insuerable
obstacles to the reconciliaion
of the conflicting interests and
itended to resign. Almost immeiately
the premier drove to the
alace and had an audience with the
;ing.
Itoiiiinliii); Fond Dictator.
It now is remarked that when Mr.
squith was asked in the Mouse of
ommons yesterday if a food dictate
had been appointed he replied
tiarply:
"I don't like a food dictator."
There is much talk tonight of the
ossibilities of a general election. Mr.
onar Maw would first form a cablet.
if he takes office, as it is necesiry
that the government be carried
n, and then appeal to the electors
jr a ratification of his administraon.
There is strong opposition, howver.
to any political campaign which
ust necessarily divert the country's
riergies from the war work, and the
ew government may decide to go
liead with the approval of the Housw
f Commons only.
The part David Lloyd-George r-?
laying in the crisis was demonrated
today by the fact that he retained
in his office while the prelier
conferred separately with tho
iberal and Conservative members
the Cabinet. Mr. Lloyd-Georges
liey had supporters in both camps,
s strongest Liberal friend. Lord

also that Mr. Bonar Law reaired
