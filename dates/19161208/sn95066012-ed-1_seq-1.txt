10 ESCAPE
Germans Capture 8,003 Men and
24 Cannon
BUCHAREST GARRISON RETREATS
Must Travel Many Miles Before
Reaching Position Promising
Any Safety.
Berlin, Dec. 8. The capturo oi a
Rumanian, army division, which at
tempted to escape from the Alt valley
with the loss or 8000 men and 24 can
non was announced by the war oliico
today. In addition to Bucharest near
ly all of the principal towns in that
section of Rumania are in German
hands.
London, Dec. 7. Escaping the Teu
ton trap intended to catch Rumania's
armies as well as her capital, the Ru
manians and Russians who abandoned
Bucharest are retreating precipitate
ly eastward along the whole 125 mile
front in Wallachia. The rear guard Is
fighting desperately to hold hack the
pursuing Teutons. -
Though the main body has eluded
the Teuton encircling movement, 3,100
men and 10G officers were captured
yesterday by the German army that
took Ploesci, Campina, Sinaia. Since
Rumania declared war 100,000 Ruman
ians have been brought to German
prison camps, according to the Berlin
Lokal Anzeiger.
This newspaper says the Germans
believe, and observers here are in
clined to agree, that the Russo- Ru
manian retreat will not stop much be
fore Moldavia, Rumania's northern
province, is reached. Wallachia, the
southern province, will be left entirely ;
in Teuton hands, it is believed. This
means a retreat of at least 100 miles
from Bucharest.
The hope of the Central Towers
that the. Rumanian- campaign .will re
sult in a victorious peace is shown by
the fact that the Emperor sent a tele
gram to King Ferdinand of Bulgaria
expressing Joy at the result and hop
ing that "we will succeed in the near
future in convincing the enemy of the
futility of future bloodshed." similar
telegram expressing hope of a speedy
and final victory was sent by the Em
peror to the Sulton of Turkey.
Today, Berlin announces officially
the capture of Campina, an oil center
second in importance only to Ploesci
and of Slnala, I which were reported
captured yesterday. Besides being the
Rumanian summer capital, Sinaia is
a fashionable summer resort, where
are many villas of Rumania's aristo
cracy and two summer palaces.
No intimation is given today either
by Berlin or by Petrograd, which ad
mits the Husso-Rumanian retreat,
where the hostile-armies now are situ
ated. No Rumanian statement has
been issued since the Teutons won the
decisive battle of the Arges.

NEW CABINET
IS
Lloyd George Should Have Support
of House of Commons
PERSONNEL ANNOUNCED TUESDAY
Ministry to Be Composed of 12 Mem
bers from Among Whom Small War
Council Will Be Selected.
London, Dec. 8. All doubt as to the
ability of David Lloyd-George to or
ganize a new British cabinet has been
dissipated. Sufficient support in the
house of commons is now assured.
The attitudes of the Iri6h nationalist
party is the only unknown quantity.
It is expected now that the personnel
of the new ministry will be announced
on Tuesday.
London, Dec. 8. That David Lloyd
George has virtually succeeded in
forming a cabinet is indicated In the
following announcement in the Court
Circular last night: "The Right Hon
orable David Lloyd George had an au
dience of the king this evening and
accepted his majesty's offer of the
post of prime minister and first lord
of the treasury and kissed his hands
ujkjii his appointment."
It was regarded at London yester
day afternoon as virtually certain
that David Lloyd George would suc
ceed in organizing a ministry which
will have the support of a majority
in the House of Commons, the labor
party liaving decided to participate iu
the making up of the new cabinet
It is said that George Nicoll Barnes,
labor member of Parliament for the
Blackfriars division of Glasgow and
a privy councillor and Arthur Hen
derson, president of the board of ed
ucation in tho coalition ministry, will
be members of the cabinet aud that
one of them will sit In the war coun
ell. In addition it is also said three
under secretaryships will be allotted
to the lal)or party.
It Is understood Mr. Lloyd George
is aiming at a cabinet of 12 member
five of them unionists, five liberals
and two labor representatives. From
this number a small war council is
to be appointed. Mr. Lloyd George's
difficulty at present Is to obtain ade
quate liberal representation Inasmuch
as nearly all the liberals In Mr." As
qulth's cabinet are declining to serve
under him. However, it was decided
at a meeting of the liberal war com
mittee, held under the chairmanship
of Sir Frederick Cawley and attended
by 30 members, to support the new
premier actively.
The new premier has a nucleus in
A. Bonar Law, Iord Derby, Ijrd Cur
zon, Sir Frederick E. Smith and Sir
Edward Carson, while, Visrount Read
ing, the lord chief justice, Is likely
to join the ministry. Other liberal
members may be drawn frcm men
such as Sir Frederick Cawley and Sir
George Pollard, who. although the
public has heard little of them, have
done efficient work in committees. Dr.
Christopher Addison, parliamentary
undersecretary for munitions, is al
most certain to have a place in the
cabinet and Col Winston Spencer
Churchill, former first lord of the ad
miralty, is slated for a high office.
Under the circumstance.! it is be
lieved the construction of the cabinet
will be a matter of only a day or so
and that by Monday the new govern
ment will meet the House of Com
mons to learn what manner of recep
tion will bo accorded it. A test of
its strength can be made on tiie vote
of credit which must bo moved im
mediately. BOOM FOR JOHNSON
California Governor Will "Not
At-
i tempt ts Minister to It."
Harkensack, N. Y., Dec. 8. United
States Senator-elect Hiram Johnson
of California, in a letter to Alfred
Gramlich, republican stato committee
man, made public here last night, ex-'
pressed his thanks for a boom started
lor him for president In 1920 at a re-1
cent dinner of New Jersey progressive '
republicans, but added that he "would
not attempt to minister to tt," as he
felt that "it would hardly be taken sc
Tlously." The senator-elect asserted
ho was "a little too doubtful" about
himself and his ability "to contemplate
such a dazzling prospect."

FROM EUGENE SARGOOD
Says His Place of Business Has Bten
Misrepresented
Editor of The Banner:
For some time there has been a re
port in circulation concerning an acci
dent that occurred to me while auto-
ing into Bennington. There was a
young man In the car at the time of
the accident, but he had not been out
of the state, with me nor to any place
: whatsoever with me. He was on the
I way to Bennington from Hoosick Kails I
i a Twl )ya i'0 o fiillrujl It 1ln U'ltivtlt of i
t!lat v knowing who ho was
I understand he went to Hoosick Falls
by trolley.
The accident occurred at what might
le called Dead Man's Curve near Phil
lip Jacobs. The spokes of the left
hand rear wheel broke from the hub
and with the rim left the car and the
and stopped the car or otherwise the
car would have gone Into the fence, j
As It was the car turned completely j
over ahead and did not leave the road, j
The driver was not drunk and had not I
been drinking and but for his prompt
and efficient action in applying the
biakes the accident might have been
worse.
Not one of the party that were com
ing in with me were Intoxicated nor
had any of them been drinking so far
as I know. The curve there Is a
dangerous one, being the same curve
whene other similar accidents have
occurred.
I had been to the Pine Hotel of
which I am proprietor. There had
been a dance. There had been a
laifee number of people ther, and there
were many more from other sections
than from Bennington. All of thera
were well behaved and many were the
best people in their localities.
The place is managed strictly within
the laws of the state of Nt w York tip-1
on an absolutely moral basis. There
Is not one spot on Its record with the ,
authorities. There Is no sale of li
quor to anyone under eighteen and
not a woman works on the premises
nor are they allowed to make it a re
sort. The trade of the place is too ex
tensive to permit any risk by resort
ing to or allowing any ilfegal, immor
al or questionable practices. It would
not be good financial policy to jeopard
ize a good business supported by leg
itimate and resptvtable trade by re
sorting to anything on a lower plane
from which the returns would not be
so extensive. ,
Joseph (iarreau who is manager of
the place has a wide experience in
that line and the place is s well man
aged as any place of its kind in the
state of New York. He is a manager
whom they do not put anything over
on.
I thought I would writo this piece to
correct any misrepresentations that
aro afloat.
We invito Investigation by the peo
ple, of Bennington and vicinity, the
public In general or from anybody.
There was no one in the party with
mo seriously hurt. I was injured tho
worst having three broken ribs.

THOSE "EYE GATES"
Many
Things Heard and Read That
Are not Appreciated.
It. has long been Baid that "seeing
is believing." The ear is not to be
depended upon. It could be commit
ted for heresy at any time. It cannot
believe all it hears and on that ac
count often takes the wrong side of
the question. It is never quite sure
of anything. But the eye sees and
knows. It seldom errs. It is accur
ate. Its judgment is dependable. The
things which makes the deepest im
pression on the mind are those that
are seen; things that pass to the mind
through the "eye gate" aro not soon
forgotten, and the "eye gate" becomes
the main channel of information.
The pioneer of all learning is the
eye. Young and old alike ask ques
tions about what they see. Publish
ers of modern literature take advan
tage of this and use illustrations, so
that the main points 'of the story or
article may btj impressed upon the
minds of readers through, the "eye
gates" and thus be permanently es
tablished. In selecting a Bible to present to
its readers The Banner found several
that set up the claim of being illus
trated, but, upon Investigation, they
were shown to merely contain "pic
tures" placed ut random in the vol
ume, "n the Illustrated Bible which
we selected every illustration in its
place. Beside being in its place, it
' accurately aud appropriately portrays
I the subject matter which it acocm
panies and makes clear illuminates
it gives to it an added interest and

OF FHilE.SH'.
Cardinal Declares Vote Robs Wom
an of Grace and Character
DETRIMENT 10 NATION AND RACE
Political Life Has Not Been Benefited
or Purified by Woman
Suffrage.
Washington, Dec. 8. The first na
tional gathering of women opposed to
woman suffrage was opened here yes
terday with addresses by Maj-Gen
Leonard Wood, Miss Mabel T. Board
man, member of the American Red
Cross central committee and Mrs.
Arthur M. Dodge of New York, presi
dent of the national association oppos
ed to woman suffrage, under whose
call the convention is held. Cardinal
Gibbons sent a special message and
former Senator Elihu Root of New
York York had prepared a paper to be
read on the constitutional phases of
the proposed equal suffrage amend
ment. Relief work done for the Red
Cross by autl-suffrage- organizations
wa3 Miss Boardmana subject.
Cardinal Gibbons sent a message
deprecating woman suffrage, which
was read. The cardinal declared: "The
insistence on a right of participation
in active political lite is undoubtedly
calculated to rob woman of her grace
of character and give her nothing in
return but masculine boldness end ef
frontery. Any occupation, however
alluring in its specious pretense,
which draws woman's attention from
her most exalted duties of mother
hood will result in detriment to the na
tion and the race.
"As far as I have observed, it ap
pears that woman suffrage to the ex
tent that it has been granted in this
country has not changed the result
of the election. There has been a
larger vote, but the results have been
the same as they would have been if
women had not voted. Thus it seems
that our political life has not been
benefited or purified by the entrance
of woman into the political arena,
though tho domestic life of those en
gaged in this 'political work must, have
been neglected or at least imimired.
"I regard 'woman's rights' women
and the leaders of the new school of
female progress as tiie worst enemies
of the lemalo sex," continued Cardi
nal Gibbons. "I wish I could im
press on American women the dan
gers that would attach to such inuo
vat ions.
"The most precious, undeveloped as
set of any nation is its children. An
all-wise' God through, the law of Na
ture has committed this precious
treasure in a special manner to the
mother. Women cannot vote intelli
gently unless they give time to an in
telligent study of political questions,
and all such time taken from the
household will be injurious to the fu
ture generation, without giving to the
present generation any appreciable
benefit in tho purifying of the ballot.
"When I deprecate female suffrage '
I am pleading for the dignity of worn-'
an, I am contending for her honor. I (
am striving to perpetuate those peer '
less prerogatives Inherent In her sex
those charms and graces which exalt
womankind and make her the orna
ment und coveted comiuuiion of man.
Woman is queen, indeed, but her em
pire is the domestic kingdom. The
greatest political triumphs she could
achieve in public fade into insignifi
cance compared with the serene glory
which radiates from the domestic
shrine and which Bhe illuminates and
warms by her conjugal and motherly
virtues."

"Bennington Pottery," and Mrs. C. H.
Emmons had prepared a most inter

industry. Mrs. Emmons was unable
to attend the meeting and the paper
was read by her sister, Miss Helena

pottery across the road, from what is
now the house of W. S. HInman.

making tho afternoon one of unusual
