Sweeping Changes Neces

WANTS MORE POWER
FOR THE PRESIDENT
Makes Plea for Action and
Asks Full Control for
State.
Paris, Dec. 8.—A French political
writer of note who has exceptional in
side knowledge of affairs has written
the following article on the allied po
litical situation:
"Sir Edward Carson said a year
ago:
'It is a terrible error to think on®
can preserve all the organizations of
peace times during a war.' The
French crisis, which is not really a
crisis but a regeneration, has no oth
er origin but this.
"The institution of a new order of
things is incumbent on the French as
on the British and Russian govern
ments. Everywhere military meth
ods. discipline, co-ordination, and se
lection are .essential to the supreme
necessity of immediate action. When
one has constructed cannon able to
hurl shells at an iiltlal speed of so
mainy hundred yard*? a second it Is
Impossible for the men behind these
cannon—the military leaders and po
litical organizers—to have a thinking
capacity, the rapidity of which is not
In relation to the powers of these en
gines. And when one has shells
weighing a ton which strike a target
with the force of a mountain hurled
from its base the men who directly
or indirectly have unloosed this de
fensive cataclysm must project their
ideas from the state of conception
to that of realization with the same
lightning' rapidity and the same for
midable impact. In all the European
states now at war there Is a search
for these men of rapid thought and
immediate action.
"It has become impossible to keep
the civil population behind the line of
the arm'les without an immediate link
of co-operation with the combatants.
The zone of the armies is a fiction.
The general mobilization of all able
bodied men after two years of war
entails the mobilization of the whole
population. It might have been fore
Been. Make peace or act. Make
peace or have universal state control.
There is no question of making peace.
After a week of the chamber's secret
jjesslon, if anything has transpirpd of
parliament's deliberations, it is the
unshakable resolution of the country
to pursue the. war, to make new' ef
forts and, sacrifices.
Act Rapidly.
"Another" sentiment is also becom
ing more and more pronounced after
eight days debating—the necessity to
take resolutions rapidly. The cham
ber^has decided to hear in public the
questions put down for secret hearing,
and it is even resolved to eliminate
some to shorten the secret session. It
is necessary to deliberate. It is of
capital importance to deliberate rap
idly. Is the present governmental or
ganization of France in conformity
with the great exigencies of the war
and of the inevitable' transformation
which it entails, morally'and materi
ally, in this country? This, in short,
Is the great question now under dis
cussion. Firstly there is at the top
the supreme chief representing the
nation. Are his powers sufficient—
top restrictiye or badly restricted?
The president of the French republic
resembles in nothing the president of
the United States. He lacks the war
powers which make of the American
chief magistrate the leader of direct
action.
"Secondly, does the actual number
of ministers answer the requirements
of the house? An under secretary
of state for munitions, food and trans
port has been created. Do not, for
example, hygiene and other great pub
lic services demand the administra
tive organization and supreme control
of the state?
Army Needs Revision.
"Thirdly,- after two years of war
and after great battles, is not the re
4 vision of the supreme command neces
sary? There are meii bred of their
great efforts for whom advisory posts
could be reserved in recognition of
the great services rendered, and there
are others whose talent has been re
vealed who could be promoted to po
sitions which need their energy and
initiative. At a time when oncv more
the flower of French manhood is to
be called to arms,- regeneration is
necessary, beginning at the top.
Whatever the civil or military situa
tion of individuals who by their age,
vigor, and capacities are no longer
up to the level of what the hour calls
for. Here again comparison between
men and their armaments comes in.
Big guns are very efficacious but
quickly wear out. France has had
not only to renew her armaments,
but to invent and create new ones.

Berlin, Thursday, Via London,
Dec. 8.—The German government
Issued a statement today in explan
ation of the Justification of the
transfer of Belgian laborers to Ger
many, a measure by no means a
hardship for the laborers but a so
cial necessity, it says.
Owing chiefly to the British em
bargo against Belgium overseas
trade, which before the war sup
ported a large part of the Industrial
population, a large number of Bel
gium workers are idle, the state
ment says, and conditions are
growing worse. Many families have
become objects of public charity.
More than a fifth of the total
population of Belgium require as
sistance. More than 650,000 per
sons are without work and these
masses of idle people, the state
ment says, are degenerating and
drunkenness and social depravity
resulting.

(Herald Special Service.)
Winnipeg, Dec. 8.—Officials of
farmers' organizations state that
many of the farmers of the prairie
provinces were holding and would
hold their wheat for higher prices.
"They have made a study of the
world shortage," said one, "and many
of them have concluded that wheat
prices will be much higher than they
have been. It is the belief here that
approximately 10,000,000 bushels of
Canadian wheat must go into the
United States for seed for next year's
crop."
Weather conditions are not eo fa
vorable in western Canada, snow
falling in most sections. Heavier
snow is reported in the Rockies with
attendant conditions, winds and lower
thermometer registrations, which
seem to promise colder and more
wintry weather for the prairies in the
