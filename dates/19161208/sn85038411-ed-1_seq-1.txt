FRENCH DEPUTIES
' VOTE CONFIDENCE
IN GOVERNMENT
Approve Conduct of War in
Resolutions After Stormy
Session
SOCIALISTS CRITICISE
Fear Conflict Will Never End;
Final Vote Is 311 to
160
Paris. Pec. 7. The chamber of
deputies by a vote of 544 to 160 to
night passed a resolution expressing
confidence in the government in its
conduct of the war.
The vote was taken at the con
clusion of a public session which fol
lowed the tenth secret session at which
nineteen resolutions were introduced.
After the doors were thrown open
Premier Briand addressed the cham
ber ar.d said that the government
would accept only a resolution imply
ing confidence, which was introduced
by Deputy Baboud. This resolution
read as follows
The chamber notes the decla
rations of the government con
cerning the reorganiation of the
general staff and approves its
resolution to concentrate under
restricted direction the conduct of
the war and the economic organ
ization of the country. The cham
ber also expresses confidence in
the government to make, in full
accord with our allies, common
sacrifices and efforts recognized as
indispensable to arrive by re
doubled energy at a victorious
issue.
Criticises Course of War
Premier Briand was followed by two
Socialists, who criticised the conduct
of the war and declared:
"After the way this stationary war
Is being conducted, we are compelled
to ask ourselves will it ever end."
Deputy Mistral said that public
opinion had been unfavorably im
pressed by the declaration of the Rus
sian premier regarding Constantinople.
His remarks aroused a storm of pro
test.
M. Noulens, president of the Rad
ical-Socialist party also criticised the
conduct of the war by the government.
He read a declaration which has been
adopted at a meeting of his group to
the effect that in the interests of the
sacred union individual members of
the left should vote according to their
conscience.
Andre Tardieu, a new member of
the chamber and formerly editor of
the Temps, supported a resolution
blaming the government for its weak
ness and mistakes. He insisted on
the priority of his resolution.
M. Millerand. former secretary of
war, declared that he would vote for
the government. He called on the
chamber to trust in the patriotism of
Premier Briand.
If. Renaudei, leader of the Socialist
party, also declared he would vote for
the government, together with a part
of the Socialist group. The minority
Socialists protested and a close in the
debate was then demanded from all
parts of the chamber.
The first test vote came on the
priority of M. Tardieu's hostile reso
lution, which was rejected. 395 to 117.
Holland and Germany
Reach Agreement on
Exportation of Foodstuffs
London. Dec. 8. An Amsterdam
dispatch to the Times says that the
Berlin Vcssische Zeitung announces
that an agreement has been reached
between Holland and Germany re
garding the exportation of foodstuffs
identical to thet existing between Hol
land and England. The Amsterdam
correspondent of the Vosslsche Zei
tung says that it is really if not tech
nically an agreement between Ger
m-iny and England vhere' y both may
obtain food from Holland.
The Times correspondent interprets
this as meaning that Dutch ships car
rying food to England will not be mo
lested by German submarines or seiz
ed by destroyers. He adds: "It is
part of a wide agreement," and also
says that the understanding with Hol
land provides for the payment of food
stuffs by German treasury notes.

with disobedience because tlicy parti

home" demonstration.
Four hundred men of the Eighth
regiment noisily protested against
their enforced stay. They were
ordered to desist after "taps" had been
sounded, but the men under arrest
continued the racket. They were then
ordered to remain in the company
street without leave.
Major General Clement of the
Eighth, announced that he has no ob
jection to these almost nightly demon
strations, so long as the men conline
the protest parades to their own hours.
In every district of El Paso these
demonstrations have been held decry
ing the Washington policy which the
troops declare Is responsible for their
continued stay along the border. otli
cers of the Pennsylvania division have
said that they believe further service
here is ridiculous, and that while they
sympathize with the men in the dem

ment, during the last few days have
sent home many menus of their
Thanksgiving dinner to show the

carried a colored cut of the American
