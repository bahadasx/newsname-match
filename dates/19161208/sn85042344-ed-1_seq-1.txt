BRITAIN'S NEW
CABINET READY
Lloyd George Submits Draft
List to King; Names of
Ministers Withheld.
LORD N0RTHCLIFFE DECLINES
Noted Publisher Says He'd
Rather Sit in News Office;
Complete by Thursday.
LONDON, Doc. 7. 1 0 : .1 T. p. m.)
David Lloyd-George nt Buckingham
palace tonight formally kissed the
king's hands on his ueecptanec of the
offices of prime minister and first
lord of the treasury. This Indicates
that In an unexpectedly short time
the ni w premier sees his way to the
formation of an administration and
lie probably was able to submit to Un
king a preliminary draft list of
principal proposed ministers.
Doubtless mu Ii remains to lie done
In the way of the allocation of the
new posts and, so far lis tiin public is
concerned, Ihe personnel of the min
istry Is a milter of pure speculation.
But the premier still has plenty ot
time before he has to meet parliament
on Tuesday to complete details, and
he will doubtless be in a position to
present to t tie house of commons his
new national ministry rcprescntlm.' nil

the Nationalists and. If common re
port is to lie trust !, comprising a
strong business element.
ny ;et ljlMr Support.
Little leliance can he placed upon
the numerous names canvassed dur
ing the day, but it seems ii rtain that
his field of choice Is much wider than
was hastily assumed last nii-hl when
Ihe admittedly diffi"ult task confront
ing him was uppermost In the public
mind and prov.pke.l inlslovings re
garding his "nances of seeming any
ci ntinucd support In parliament.
These misgivings to a large extent
have eisappeared mainly owing to the
fact that lie has been aide to gain the
support of the iiibor party by an offer
of two ministerial posts and three tin
dersecretaryships. Will Command Majority.
With the vote of the Ijiborites to
gether with the bulk of the I'nlonists
and a large section of the Liberals de
manding more energetic prosecution
of the war, Mr. Lloyd-George prob
ably will command a working major
ity in the house of coinincns, while a
further asset will lie tho benevolent
neutrality even of the supporters of
the lute cabinet In tho national Inter
ests. i-osslbly
ministerial
soned for
a',1
many parliamentary and
traditions will be Jettl
Mr. Lloyd-George has a
for courage and boldness
a great stickler for tiadl-
.tton. Therefore some surprises may
appear in the distribution of the new
otlices
What already Is apparent,
however, is that tho new ministry will
not, as was at first assumed, bo a
mere glorified war council of only a
few members, but a ministry on the
old lilies, but much smaller than the
Asquith administration.
Trouble of Own Making.
How Mr. Lloyd-George proposes to
get over tho difficulty of his own
making when ho declared mat me
premier was too occupied to be able
to preside over tho war council, Is still
one of the problems unsolved.
It appears that Mr. l.ioyd-i.eorge s
plans were only secured by a narrow
majority in the meeting of the Labor
party and there may be some restivc-
ness on Ine part ol a section oi me
party, hut this Is not likely to Inter
fere with tho completion of the cabi
net. It Js stated that feeling has been
moused In the party that the new
policy of "thoro" adopted by the new
government may Include the natioti

WASHINGTON FEARS
SUBMARINE TROUBLE
Germany's Answer in Ar
Case Not Satisfactory
President Considering.
ubia
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Germany's
acceptance :f responsibility for the
sinking without warning of Ihe Brit
ish liner Arabia, with tho explanation
that her submarine commander took
Iho vessel for an auxiliary warship,
has brought the Issue over submarine
warfare to u inure serious and elem
ent basis than anything that has hap
pened since the threat of the I'niled
Slates last April to break diplomatic
relation alter the torpedoing of the
channel liner Sussex.
Such information us the American
government now has tends lo show
that the Arabia was n passenger ship
of the Peninsular and irient lino,
passing thru tho. Mediterranean .m a
tegular voyage. Amuig tho manyi
passengers was an American citizen,
w lio was rescued.
The German note which was innde
public today by the state department
savs if official data Ih furnished show
ing that the vessel was an ordinary
passenger steamer, "this, then, would
be a rase of regrettable mistake from
which the German government would
promptly draw the appropriate conse
quences." It Is assumed here that the
cc nsequences w ould be an expression
i f regret und an offet nf reparation
for any Inpuy or danger suffered by
Americans on board.
The note has been referred to Presi
dent Wilson,' who Is considering per
sonally a review of recent German
submarine actlvltle to which the Ara.
hilt case comes us a climax. There
probably will be no immediate action,
as tho state depot tmeiit Jim must
dear up beyond question the ex li t
status of the liner at the tlmo of the
attack.
Consider Answer Weak.
In official iiiarters tho German
explanation Is regarded as weak und
unsatisfactory, no weight being at
tached to the statement that the
Ara bin was painted liko a transport
and was following a route usually
taken by transports and that the sub
marine commander saw many Chinese
hut no women and children aboard
her It is realized, however, that If
official data finally establishes the In
nocent rhuructer of tho vessel, in view
or the Sussex note virtually only ouo
course or action remains open to the
l iilted States and that would not lie
taken until every possible considera
tion had been given Germany's posi
tion.
Yn Comment Given.
While Secretary Lansing himself
refused all c meiit today beyond tho
mere publication of the note, it Is
known authoritatively that Germany's
admission 111 the Arabia case, her sim
ilar admission in the Marina ease
when six Americans were drowned
and the early fails In tin; sinking of
the American steamer Chemung have
combined to create much unxiet.v. The
temporary quietude In submarine
operation's which followed the pledges
in the Sussex case apaprently lias
been dispelled and officials are re
calling tlie belief then announced that
submarine warfare is "utterly Incom
patible with the principles of human
ity, tlie long established and Incon
trovertible rights of neutrals and tho
sacred Immunities of noiioombunt
unts." LABOR'S MEN WILL ORGANIZE
