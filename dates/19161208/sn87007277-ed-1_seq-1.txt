SMALLER ELEVENS SHOW MUCH STRENGTH
WHIPPING CORNELL'S
There was a time In football, and It
wasn't so long ago, when If a so
called small team defeated an eleven
representing one of the larger colleges
or universities it would have been
gnllty of lese majesty. It was seldom
that It happened. Occasionally, of
coarse, one of the big teams came a
cropper In an early-season clash, but
for the most part the games served
the purpose for which they were sched
uled namely, the mediums whereby
coaches gradually developed their
charges for the feature games of the
season.
Score Over Big Rivals.
But In recent years these smaller
elevens have been scoring victories
over their bigger rivals more frequent
ly. They have been climbing gradual
ly to the plane of the big teams, until
now many of the "youngsters" are en
titled to be classed with the big teams.
Swarthmore, Lafayette, Lehigh, Col
gate, Washington and Jefferson are a
few of the smaller teams that at dif
ferent times In recent seasons have
developed power enough to score vic
tories over the "big uns" in the early
practice games.
The reason for this Is evident. The

Coach R. J. Hamilton of the Kewa
See (111.) high school athletic team has
received a patent on a belt to be worn
by football captains which will furnish
signals for plays during games.
A double row of letters and figures
slide between the outer cover of the
belt and apertures permit the combina
tion of one figure and one letter to
show. The combination can be quickly
shifted and will do away with the
possibility of any member of the op

WARRIORS INTO SHAPE.
small colleges have engaged good
coaches. These mentors have been
able to whip their material into ma
chines capable of playing the best of
football. Furthermore, slace beating a
big team is quite a feather In the cap
of the little eleven the coaches have
rushed the perfection of their teams
for these early games. The smaller
elevens are developed earlier than the
big ones, the coaches of the big ones
preferring to perfect their machines by
degrees, always working with the one
or two big games on the schedule as
the objective.
Good Example.
Tufts Is a good example of the early
development of a small eleven. When
Tufts Invaded the stadium at Cam
bridge recently there were few who
anticipated a defeat for Harvard. The
majority viewed the game as an early
season romp for the Crimson. Instead
Tufts won by a 7 to 3 count
Critics were at a loss to understand
whether the upset was due to weak
ness on the part of Harvard or strength
on the part of Tufts until Tufts Invad

to resort to a field goal In the closing
minutes of play In order to win.
