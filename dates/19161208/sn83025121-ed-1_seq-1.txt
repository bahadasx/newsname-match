(AioeUt4 Mn hp rMrU irfraltM.)
WASHINGTON, Decerobr 8
"Most lear cut and "se
rious situation since the sln'ting
without warning of the Channel
ferry boat Sussex," is the way
that state department officials and
officers of the administration char
acterized the submarine situation
last, night after the reply from
Berlin to 'jjihft' American note on
the sinking Vf'theVj.'4t'0! steam
er Arabia was made pub!ic yes
terday afternoon.; m J. l :

sent the big liner without warn
ing to the bottom, and her care
less explanation of the internation
al crime as "a mistake of.the cap
tain of the submarine who thought
the vessel an auxilary war-ship" is
regarded as little less than"4' weak"
here. 4
Officials do not hesitate to point
out that the same statement was
made ina half a dozen other in
stances, notably in the Case of the
Marina, sunk "by mistake" off the
( Irish coast. Indeed there arc no
less than ten "diplomatic inquir
ies" now pending in the pigeon
holes of the office on the Wilhelm
strasse in Berlin, regarding steam
ers sunk in flat conflict with the
pledges made by Germany to the
United States, following the sink
ing of the Lusitania, and a num
ber of other vessels in which Am
erican citizens lost their lives.
Joseph G. Grew the American
charge, at Berlin, recently filed
six of these "inquiries" in one
day.
American Attitude .
With th not on the Arabia ther
are but eight left to be answered, io
eluding the eaaea on the Marina.
The United Mates baa baaed Ita atti
tude in the .case of the Arabia on the
aexumption that it was unarmed and
torpedoed without warnina, and is un
able to see that there was adequate
justification for forcing the passengers
into the boats- Washington believes
the submarine commander, on aacer
taining that there were women and
children on the decks, should have re
f rained from making an attack.
Tba Arabia Oaaa
Germany points out that, according
to testimony of her own passengera,
the Arabia, was armed, and used her
cannon; that the sea was smooth, and
that other vessels were near. It is
argued that the Arabia, having on
board a large number of coolie war
workers, should be regarded as a trans
port.
Bent To President
The note has been aent to the White
House for the personal perusal of.Jtie
I'lf Kincnt. It is reported that he iq
tends takinu the matter under his per
sonal coiiBitlemt ion, as well as review

WASHINGTON, December 8 The
British government baa issued a circu

thirty-four commodities are permitted
to pass the new and rigid regulations,
which however affect only shipments
to Sweden, either for that country or
for Bussia.
ecntly such a eourae was considered
necessary because most of the eases in
vestigated developed no violation of
international law, and premature dis

that lie will assume that post in addi
