NEWPORT
The steamer Patsy arrived
Bafely In Newport Wednesday
morning after weathering the
'heavy storm of several days dur
ation. All hands were glad to !
get saiely to port as it was a
hard trip. -
The city election caused more
than the usual amount of inter
est because of the standing of
the candidates running for -the
Various offices. Mr. Jones who
received his nomination from the
people, is well known, having
lived most of his life in Lincoln
county and I believo it can be
truly said of him that he has
done more for the advancement
of county than any other one
man living in it. He was mayor
tof the city of Independence for
two terms and was also mayor
of Toledo two or three terms,
and the people who lived in these
cities a.t the time say they had
a steady prosperous growth un
der his administration.
Mr. Walrad filed his name and
was placed upon the ticket by
his own initiative. The Amer
ican system of public assemblys,
where the people meet to discuss
public questions and to make
nominations for the various pub
lic offices seems to have passed
out of existance. Now under
the new system every one who
wants to run for office, whether
he is qualified or not, nominates
himself. The people are not
consulted in the matter, but the
candidate Is the Judge of his own
qualifications that is to say he
recommends himself and in this
way a great many cheap men
are foisted upon the public. The
right of petition also appears to
have gone into disuse, this also
was one of the cherished Amer
ican rights.
The logic of Bacon was- to try
all things and hold fast to that
which is good. This is the ex
perience of the world.
Age does not destroy the val
ue of truth.
The following city officers
were duly elected for the ensue
ing year: Mayor, W. G. Walrad ;
Recorder, D. T. Harding; Treas
urer, Arthur Wing; Marshal, A.
J. Brown. For Councilmen, first
rard, George Savage, second
ward, It. F. Baker, third ward,
Charles Roper. Mr. Schwartz,
the newly elected assessor, was
councilman In the third ward,
his place will be filled by appoint
ment. Mr. Walrud, the newly
elected mayor, was councilman
in the second ward and his
pdace also will De filled by ap
pointment. The interest of
Newport Is growing more Im
portant every year and it is of
the greatest importance that we
have a strong city government
and that the interests of the city
will be carefully guarded from
grafts, waste of money or care
less and Indifferent administra
tion. The storm Saturday night was
the hardest we have had for
many years. The wind blew
about 80 miles per hour com
ing from the southwest. Some
damage was done to the city.
The front of the store building
on Front street just South of
the Newport House was blown
out. At the Copeland docks the
large float was broken loose,
parting three cables. The two
launches, Fearless and Mud Hen,
broke loose and drifted 6ome
distance up the bay but were
secured the next morning with
out any damage. At Agate
Beach a cottage that belonged
to Mr. Vader had the roof blown
oft. Drift and logs were strewn
along the beach for many miles.
No other damage reported.
The grand oall given on
Thanksgiving Day by the Rod
and Gun Club was a great suc
cess. The hall was decorated
with beautiful flowers and em
blems and the masquerades
were the best that ever appear
ed in Newport. The hall though
large was crowded with merry
makers coming from Elk City,
Toledo, and Waldport. Over a
hundred couples were on the
floor at once.
The music was fine, being
furnished by the orchestra from
Yaquina. A great number of
nice prizes were awarded, but as
I did not keep the list I cannot
give them now.
. The supper was Berved at mid
night and it was superb. - Tho
Women of Woodcraft prepared
and served the repast. . The
members of the club had killed
about fifty ducks and they were
baked with dressing. I tell you
they were delicious!
The cooking was under the
direction of Mrs. Schumacher
and that is a guarantee of qual
ity. One hundred and fifty per
sons took supper. This is the
first duck supper that was ever
given by a Rod and Gun Club
in the state.
Married at the residence of
the officiating clergyman, Rev.
G. E. Pratt, H. 0. Boynton and
Miss Mary Sparks, both of Eddy
ville. The young couple will
spend their honeymoon at New
port after which they will make
their home on Mr. Boynton's
beautiful farm near Eddyville.
Their many friends and neigh
bors wish them a long and happy,
life, with many joys and no sor
rows. Attorney W. E. Gwynn and
family will movo to Puyallup to
make their future home where
Mr. Gwynn will continue the
practice of law. The many
friends of Mr. and Mrs. Gwynn
wish them success and happi
ness in their future home.

LINCOLN COUNTY CAN PAY
OFF ITS WARRANT DHBT
UNDER NEW LAW
The Lincoln county court can
lawfully audit and direct the
payment of about $66,000 in
warrant Indebtedness at the De
cember term, and, if it does, the
county clerk can lawfully issue
warrants therefor, First Assist
ant Van Winkle of the attorney
general's office told District At
torney Stewart in an opinion
Wednesday. The district attor
ney wished to know If the 6 per
cent limitation amendment
would interfere.
Van Winkle says in Mis opin
ion that the prohibition against
indebtedness by counties in the
performance of duties of obli
gations imposed by law, only
applies to indebtedness "here
after created" and not. to such
debts outstanding at the time of
its adoption and that this applies
as well to the Issuance of war
rants for payment of such debts.
Consequently it is not mater
ial, so far as this const it ni!on:ii
provision is concerned, what is
the amount of indebtedness of
jthe county incurred in such
( manner and existing at the time
!of its adoption, but the limita
tion expressed in the amendment
upon tne power of creating pub
lic indebtedness applies only to
such debts of the county created
after said amendment takes ef
fect," says Van Winkle in the
opinion. "The limitation upon
voluntary or contractional in
debtedness has been in effect
every since the constitution was
Urst aaonted. and rnnnonnonllv
is not changed in any way by
uie recent amendment, except
that involuntary debta. 'h proa f.
ter created,' are to be counted
wua voluntary debts in arriving
at the total amount to whirh h
limitation applies outstanding at
anv tlmp"
In answer to an inquiry from
District AttOmev Dpvpra nf I .nna
county, Van Winkle said that the
j constitutional limitation would
not apply to present indebted
ness is provided for in the tax
levy now being made.
I It is apparent that if the tax
;nas neen levied, although not
yet collected, warrants there
from WOllld not Iia rnnBlrtoi'oil on
indebtedness, especially if there
1 1 a special lunu in course or col
j lection from which any partic
ular ooiigation Is to be paid. Van
