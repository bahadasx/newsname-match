weie disposed of to Schorling and one to

PREMIER ASQUITII RESIGNS.
David Lloyd Goorgo Now Forming a
New Cabinet, Having Accepted tho
Premiership,
The reconstruction of n new cabinet
is' now under way in Great Britain,
On Tuesday night the lesignntion of
Herbert II. Asquith, who has held the
premiership through eight stormy years
of domestic and rorcign trouble, re
signed. King Gcorgo summoned A.
Bonar Law, minister of the colonies, to
Duckiugham palace, and offered him the
prime minister's commission. Ho de
clined to take up tho dlllicult tnsk mm
it was later nccepted by David Lloytl
George, former war secretary. It is
expected that tho latter will rccogniz.
tho Unionists and tho Labor party in
making his appointments. Tho change
is I'egarded in a way as a victory for
the Tory element in Great Britain, al
though Lloyd George 1ms not been iden.
tilled with that element. It is be
lieved that tho clinugo will mean n
moio vigorous prosecution of tho war
than over before.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Wilson's message which ho
rend to congress Tuesday is brief and
to the point. Other presidents of the
past 30 years havo used thousands of
words in addressing the national legis
lators, but Mr. Wilson speaks his lit
tle piece each time in a few hundred,
or ut the most two or threo thousand
words. His latest utterance concerns
chiefly legislation which ho considers
necessary to supplement the Adamson
law, hurriedly enacted to avert a threat
ening crisis.
He stands by the eight-hour day for
men engaged in interstate railroad
transportation, but he advises two pro
visions that may not mid to his popu
larity. He would forbid nny sudden
strike, though, when the late threat was
made, his policy was quite the contrary,
and he would have a law passed that
gave the President power to draft into
the military service theso samo men.
The two recommendations look to a
recognition of the imperative need of
unobstructed railroad communication
and they are sound, oven if they happen
to come after the campaign is over.
They would hardly have been expected
earlier.
The President fdels strongly that tho
interstate commission should bo en
larged and its powers expanded, and
thero is a growing sentiment favorable
to this in tho country. One of tho
guesses for tho futuro is that the fed
eral government will control the roads
outright beforo long. The drift is all
that way.
It seems to be tho proper caper in al
leged smart chatter nowadays to use
tho expression "quite some." It has
about as much meaning as tho cam
paign orator's "now, then."
Local merchants will be sure to prof
it by tho distribution of $13,000 to the
members of tho Christmas savings club
of tho Brattleboro Trust company. Of
course comparisons aie invidious and
we never indulge in them but wo hap
pen to notice that two such clubs in
Bellows Falls will distribute $15,000.
The Caledonia County Bar associa
tion has adopted a bill of rates for min
imum charges in routine legal work, to
o into effect at once. The announce
ment of what charges will be is pub
lished in the St. Johusbury papers and
is signed by .'11 reputable lawyers. An
examination of the price list, as wo
view it from a layman's standpoint, is
that the charges aro entirely reason
able. The Caledonia county practition
ers are to bo congratulated on their
straightforward way of doing business
as well as the good spirit which they
show in reaching an agreement which
will bo fair to all clients. Wc are not
trying to run other people's business,
but we nro pleased to cull tho attention
of lawyers in Windham county and else
where to tho Caledonia county plan.
Billy Sunday called the baseball
evangelist from tho fact that he was
playing with tho famous Chicago Na
tionnl team under Capt. A. C. Anson
when he was converted is scoring tho
greatest success of his career in his
renmrknblo campaign in Boston. The
attendance nt the great tabernaclo has
been over half n million people, tho col
lections have amounted to ninny thou
sands of dollars, and tho "trail hit
ters," or pcoplo who havo expressed a
conversion to a Christian life, numbor
somo 15,000. Sunday is a master of
slang, invective and vituperation, but
ho hits hard at tho inevitable results
of sin and the ovils of intemperance.

POMONA GRANGE MEETING.
Annual Session lit Brattlo Yesterday
Question of Meeting Elsewhere
Came Up for Discussion,
Tho annual meeting of tho Windham
County Pomona Grange began yester
day morning in Knights of Columbus
hall with it fair attendance. There
was considerable discussion over the
proposition to change the placo of the
annual mooting from Brattleboro, where
it has been held for years, to somo oth
er town, nnd u committee consisting of
Fred Smith and Walter Robbins of
Dratlieboro and Mrs. Abbio Patch of
Dumnicraton was appointed to report
on tho matter. A committee on resolu
tions was appointed to draw up reso
lutions on the deaths of Oscar T. Ware
and Mrs. Julia Harris.
These olliceis were elected at tho af
ternoon session: Master, Fred Smith
of West Brattleboro; overseer, Edwin
H. Brown of East Diimmerston; lectur
er, Mrs. O. V. Hcflloii of Wardsboro;
steward, Dr. F. L. Osgood of Town
shend; assistant steward, Charles C.

TUDORS PLACED IN JAIL.
Ernest of Brattleboro and George of
Wardsboro Arrested on Execution in
Kennctt & Mudgett Case.
Ernest Tudor of Brattleboro was ar
rested yesterday morning by Sheriff
Mann mid taken to Xewfane jail on a
close jail execution as tho result of a
supreme court decision just handed
down in the series of suits nnd counter
suits between Kenneth & Mudgett, a
lumber firm, and Ernest Tudor and his
father, George Tudor of Wardsboro.
George Tudor was arrested late in the
afternoon by Sheriff Mann and lodged
in jail.
Kennett & Mudgett won the supreme
court decision which involved a judg
ment for a little over $1,000 and costs
and ns n result of tho failure to pay
the judgment the two men were taken
to satisly the judgment.
Tho government estimates sent to
congress Monday amount to $1,054,819,
034.03 tho greatest sum ever asked of
congress. Thousands of salary increases
aro recommended and army and navy
expenses nro figured at nertrly $800,000,
000. Wo suppose tho Democrats who
came into power in 191.'! on promises to
reduco expenses say that they won on
a theory but that a condition now con
fronts them.
One does not havo to go outside the
confines of Windham county to find ex
amples of tho Christmas tree evil. Tho
thirteen carloads that wero shipped last
week from Willianisvillo station prob
ably did not yield the owners of the
pastures from which they were cut
a total of more than $200 at the most,
and yet if they had been left to grow
into timber they would have added
thousands of dollars to the value of the
laud on which they stood.
Daniel L. Cndy, who wrote "Butch
ering in the Fall," printed on page 10
of this paper, lived in a Vermont rural
community 23 to 33 years ago there
isn't tho slightest question about that.
He pictures a condition which prevailed
in the period named in such a way that
it will revive memories among thou
sands of Vermontors in middle life. Mr.
Cndy has been doing some clover work
lu verse in a stylo recalling Will Carle
ton. Wo hope to hear more from him.
Congress will be rushed for time iu
which to transact tho important busi
ness of the session and the administra
tion will bo commended in proposing
a suspension of the customary recess
for tho Christmas holidays. First of
all measures in importance, ns fnr as
tho general interest of the public is
concerned, is the eight hour law nnd its
relation to the Adamson act. Doubtless
tho supreme court will strain a point
in order that the constitutionality of
that act may bo determined at Qiieo.
Whatever the decision, there will be
need of further legislation on tho sub
ject in order to mnko tho act complete.
In addition, thero will bo tho regular
appropriation bills, which always oc
cupy much time beforo tho logrolling is
finished to suit tho largo number of in
terests involved. It will be a wonder
if thero are not foreign complications
which will make delay and difficulty.
Congress has enough to do of an urgent
naturo nnd it is of moro importance
to havo tho work cleaned up than for
n few hundred men to havo n good time
during thu holidays. Let them stick to
their work.
It is claimed that Germany has de
ported 100,000 Belgians. Xot only men,
but women who are skilled workers in
various industries have been compelled
to go to Germany. A revolt against
deportation took place in Antwerp in
which between 200 and 300 inhabi
tants and many German soldiers wero
killed.
CATTLE BRING $28,005
Average of $228 Highest of Any
Sale by Local Company
Cow in 30-Pound Class Brings $1,140
Bought by Metcalf of Holyoke and
Hosmcr of Chester Depot.
Tho fifth sale of tho Purebred Live
Stock Sales Co. of Brattleboro. which
closed its two days' session late Wed
nesday, represented an oxchangii
of $28,003 for 123 head of purebred
Holstein cattle. Tho average of about
$22H a head was the highest average of
any of the sales, although in the other
sales there have been individual ani
mals that brought higher prices than
the highest priced animal sold yester
day. F. H. Metcalf of Holyoke, Mass., who
was a heavy buyer of valuable animals
at some of the other sales, bought
jointly with Gcorgo Hosmer of Chester
Depot a 30-pound cow, for which they
paid $1,140. This was tho high mark
of the sale. The animal was consigned
to the sale by John Arfmann of Mid
dlctown, X. V., a well-known breeder.
Albert B. Groff of East. Petersburg,
Pa., spent the most money of any in
dividual buyer at the sale, his checks:
totaling over $1,500 in payment of his
purchases. Geoj-ge C. Caty of St. Johns
bury, one of the maple sugar kings ot
the state, ran a close second, for it
cost him over $1,400 to pay for the an
imals he bought. C. S. Weeks of Lancas
ter, X. II., wrote a cheek for over
$1,100. W. W. Sherman of Hartford,
Conn., reduced his bank account ovci
$1,000 to increase his herd of Holsteins
by several fine animals. Ariel Mitchel
son of Tnritl'ville, Conn., was a careful
buyer both days of the sale and was
set baek as a result considerably over
the $1,000 mark, while II. E. Gray ot
West field (Vt.) paid over $900 for the
animals he bought.
John Tuck of Auburn, Mass, paid
$300 for a fine cow and II. L. Pratt and
T. G. Russell of Cuttingsvillc paid $340
for a bull. Ben Lang of South Lee, X.
H.. bought another bull for which ho
paid $GS0 and Dr. G. P. Towlc of
Carlisle, Mass., spent $G75 for one cow.
When the company closed the first of
