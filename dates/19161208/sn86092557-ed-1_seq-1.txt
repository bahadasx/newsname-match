there U no mill In the state turnj
Ing out paper suitable for newspaper |
I use although all the raw material :
I which goes into newsprint is found In |
!t tho state in great abundance. It was
/ suggested during a dicusslon of tho!
7 serious paper shortage, and eonsc-1
fluent high price which the nowspa- j
pers are compelled 10 pay. that if the
West Virginia consumption weru |
' pooled it would amount to enough to
warraut a mill in this state making
1 arrangements to furnish the supply.
That will be Investigated at once.
1 Other aspects of tho paper situation
were also discussed and the outcome
of the talk was the creation of a committee
consisting of J. J. Devlne, of
the Clarksburg Telegram, Herschel C.
Ogden of the Wheeling News and Intelligencer
and Howard II. Holt of tho
Urafton Sentinel, which was Instructed
to make a thorough Investigation

t pointed lo perfect a plan for surh a
1 meeting and report at another meet-j
[ lug which in. all probability will be
held right after the first of the year in \
Parkersburg.
The necessity of increasing revenue I
and decreasing expenses was discuss.
ed and while no formul action was tali- i
t en along these lines it was the con- j
sensus of opinion that both advertising
and subscription rates will have 1
' to be advanced If newspapers are to
i continue to come out in their present
}} form.
' Twelve newspapers were reprcsontcu
at the meeting which was presld- j
ed over by J. J. Devine of the Clarks-!

the Parkersburg meeting will I
i carry on an extensive correspondence
with the publishers of daily newspapers
in the state getting their Ideas j
as to what policy should he pursued I
during the crisis which now confronts
the newspaper publishing business.
. One of the things that developed at j
1 the meeting yesterday was that some
of the newspapers of West Virginia

the work on the plans for the new

CANDIDATES FILE
PAST ELECPOH
EXPENGE TOTALS
statements show Very Little
Increase Over Former
Certificates.
--- ??-o- >1
l'ost election statements ol' all the ,
candidates in. the November election
now 011 file in me county clerk's office
show that very little additional expense
was incurred since the tiling ot
the previous statement just before the
election . Several of these who aspired
to county ofitces came dangerously
near the limit of lawful expenditures
whjch is fixed by the corrupt practices
act at $JUU. This includes both successful
and iinsticcesslul candidates
The largest sum expended accoru
lug to the grand total given in last
Liatemcnls tiled, by any u. ...e Demo
era tic candidates was that of $1&S.
111 is sum was spent by Jas. Davis,
who was re-elected assessor. Mr. Dams*
opponent, W. i>. Hamilton, itepublican,
spent but a total ol $4b.uU m nis
campaign.
'l lie next highest sum spent by any
ot the successiul Democrats was that
cf A M. Giovcr, sheriff-elect, nccording
to I lie toial of ins statements Mr.
Glover spent $lb2. \\\ il. Veacli, the
Republican candidate for sheriff. hpont;
a total ol ^lan.u.i. Mr. Veach's slate-:
incut is a model one, lie having listed
with great care each and every item,
however small, as required oy law.
Many of the other canuinates oil both
(initios merely lumped their expend!lures
under such nems as "printing,
etc.." then giving the total.
This of course might cover a multitude
of tilings and tor this reason the
law plainly siytes thai each and every
separate item shall be listed . It is
evident from an examination of the
documents that many of the candidates
of. both parties simply regard;
these statements as mere bothersome;
detail and uniiec.?ssnry red tape
The Socialist party candidates except.
in a few instances failed to file :
any statements at all. It is obligatory
however that the successful candi
dates comply with this law or they an
not legally entitled to take ...o oath
of office.
Prosecuting Attorney liaggorty, according
to his sworn statement, spent!
a much smaller sum than did his oppu j
hunt, his total being $1157 while that
of t'onlev is $1011.15.
Tlie smallest amount spent by any
of flic candidates for legislature, according
to the statements, was that of
(jeo. \V. Bowers. Itepublican. whoso
total reached but ?IS. Brooks Hutch-1
inson, Itepublican candidate for the
same office, spent a total of $120.07 i
bile one of Ids successful opponents,
Frank ilayiuoml. spent $122.20.
All .of the statements of the successful
candidates were filed by the
required time yesterday although;
many of litem waited until the last ,
day and hour before depositing tho
documents Those who failed to file
their statements evidently did not incur
any expense at all since filing precious
statements. Whether or not
statements are required in such cases
seems to have been a matter of various
opinion since many of the district
candidates and several of those for
county offices, according to their latest
certific ates, incurred no additional
expense sir.ee idling the previous
statement.
