DANIELS WARNS AGAINST AN
OVER SECURITY IN MATTER
OF U.S. NAVALPREPAREDNESS
Appeals That There be no Re
laxation of Effort Until Con
gressionol Ship Program is
Reality.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8. After re
counting in detail the phenomenal
progress of the, Navy Department dur
ing the past year, Secretary Daniels,
In his annual report to congress, con
cludes with a solemn caution that It bo
remembered that the tremendous in
crease in ships and personnel author
ized by congress Is still to be carried
out. And he appeals that there be no
relaxation of effort until It has be
come an actuality.
"I feel It my duty." writes the sec
retary, "to warn as solemnly as I
may against the. danger that lies In a
possible feeling on the part of our
people that the navy has now been
attended to, has been placed where It
belongs among the great navies ot
the world, and that there ii nothing
further to be done."
Secretary Daniels advocates an In
ternational agreement to end competi
tive and costly naval construction and
insists that "until the great navy
building countries make a practical
agreement to a reduction of armament
our country must steadily increase its
naval strength."
"Our people are now Interested In
the navy as they never were before."
continues the secretary. "They are
more familiar with our shortcomings
and good point than they have ever
been. I beg them to keep this person
al Interest. In the service, to query as
to what we are doing, to criticise
frankly whenever they feel there Is
room for criticism, and, aobve all
things, never to relax Into that state
of complacency and smug satisfaction
In our naval establishment that ex
isted five years ago, Let us not for
get that, while congress has author
ised the most splendid program ot
shipbuilding In the history of our
navy. It Is still to be executed and that
the very prosperity of our country has

(ED L. KEEN.)
LONDON, Dec. 8. The liberal
party conferred and formally resolv
ed to support the Lloyd George re
gime in prosecuting the war. This
removed all doubt that the Lloyd
George government will have full
support. The action means that the
new premier will have the backing ot
liberals, unionists and laboritea. The
Irish group's sympathies are no yet
disclosed.
The lihertil conference offered a
resolution expressing confidence in
Asqulth. Two hundred liberals of
both houses attended and accorded
Asquith an enthusiastic reception.
Asuulth presided and explained the
full details of the circumstances caus.
ing the governmental change. He
particularly defined his own position.
The public believes Lloyd George's
whirlwind mastery of the political
situation indicates the new premier
will quickly solve many of the for

In fulfilling his commission Indicates

The ghost of the library contro

for the 900 in the library ball fund
for use in prchasing furnishings for
the club room of the new county li

No action was taken on the requesjt
but it was evident from the discus
sion that a majority of the board is
prepared to resist at thlg time any
action to take the fund out of the
board's hands.
The formal request was signed by

Hole Battered Through Thick
Brick Walls With Stick of
Cord Wdod Late Yesterday
Afternoon. .
SHERIFF IS IN PURSUIT
Men nave Advantage Am Honr s
Start, But Already a Few Clews
Have Been Discovered Reward
Offered for Osptore.
Battering their way through the
thick brick walls of the county Jail,
four of the six prisoners of Sheriff
Taylor yesterday afternoon made a
successful escape and are still at
large.
The escaped men are Ed Vandiver,
held for larceny, John B. Burns and
Harvey Bensene alias Harry Went,
charged with assault and robbery,
and Steve Gunis, a Greek held for
burglary.
The Jallbreak occurred about 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon and was
not discovered until an hour later
when Dell Shuts, another prisoner,
notified the officers. Shuts and his
wife (Red Wing) were the only two
prisoners in the jail not taking ad
vantage of the hole made In the walL
I'sed Stick of Cord wood.
The men literally battered their
way to freedom, using a four foot
stick of cordwood, taken into the Jail
for fuel, as a ram. They used a
blanket over the end in order to
deaden the noise. With this ram they
were able to loosen the bricks and
remove them. To make a hole large
enough to admit the body of a man
required about an hour of battering,
according to Mrs. Shllts. They thus
begaa thair .work about t o'clock. The
hole was made jus below a window
facing the east In order to get at
the wall, the men had first to dis
place the steam pipes which ran
along the wall. They were given the
liberty of the corridors during the
daytime and were protected from dis.
covery from the Jail door by the cells.
Janitor George Simpson was work
ing just outside the window until
nearly 2:30, which bears oat tho
story that the men did not begin work
until 3 o'clock.
Shuts and his wife were evidently
not parties to the break though they
could not help but know of the work
going on. At first Shuts denied
knowledge, declaring he had been la
another part of the jail administer
ing to his wife, who was ill.
Sheriff Takes Trail.
As soon as the break was discover
ed. Sheriff Taylor took up the trail
but the hour start gave the fugitives
a big advantage. He was out until
2:30 this morning. In the meantlma
his deputies had the telephones
working and sent out circulars over
the northwest Some clews have been
received but nothing very definite.
The four escapes were being held
for the grand Jury. Vandiver, who Is
believed to be the ringleader, was
recently arrested on a charge of steal
ing grain from warehouses. He ha
been out of the Walla Walla peniten.
tiary only a short time, having serv
ed eight years there for burglary'. He
escaped from that institution Just
about a year ago and was picked up
a few days la'er by Deputy Sheriff J.
H. Estes near Echo. He is about 30
years old.
Burns and Bensene, both of whom
are young men of 22 and 19 respec
tively, are the men who beat up and
robhed an old man In the Pendleton
depot yards a few weeks ago. Thev
are charged with robbery" without thn
use of a dangerous weapon.
Gunis Is the Greek arrested last
week on a charge of burglarizing :h'
section house at Mission. Sheriff
Taylor h;us offered rewards of $l"
each for the arrest and detention of
Vandiver, Burns and Bensene.
