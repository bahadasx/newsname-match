Alfonse Britain and Gaston Russia Just About Loved Rumania
8I.VJLE COPT. nTI
THE rounding up of Rumanian
troops is being continued by
the Teutonic forces. The lat
est statement by the German war
office announces the capture of
S000 additional prisoners, together
with 26 guns.
Seemingly the Rumanians and
such Russian troops as were aid
ing them are still on the retreat
northeastward and military com
mentators for the roost part do not
expect a stand to be made by the
Rumanians before the line of the
Buzeu river is reached.
This line virtually closes the
neck of the province of Moldavia,
running eastward from the Hunga
rian frontier to Galata. on the low
er Danube, near the Bessarabian
border. It is regarded as a strong
defensive line and one easily sus
ceptible of reinforcements from
Russian sources.

only recent operation of note has

versal Military Service Is
Country's Need.
Washington. D. C, Dec. S. Compul
sory military service by all American
men of military age and physically
qualified is the only solution for the
problem of adequately defending the
United States, inasmuch as the present
army recruiting system has proved a
failure, according to Maj. Gen. H. L.
Scott, chief of staff of the United
States army, in his annual report. He
says:
"In my Judgment the country will
never be prepared for defence until we
do as other great nations do that have
large interests to guard, like Germany,
Japan and France, where everybody is
ready and does perform military ser
vice in time of peace as he would pay
every other tax., and is willing to
mrke sacrifices for the protection he
p ts and the country gets in return.
There Is no reason why one woman's
I son should go out and defend or be
trained to defend another woman and
.her son who refuses to take training
or give service. The only democratic
method Is for every man in his youth
to become trained in order thafoe may
rcnaer eiucieni service it called upon
in war."
National Guard Trainlns Inadequate.
Taking up the question of the na
tional guard in Its federal status. Gen.
Scott declares the training period of
75 days in three years provided! by the
new national defence aet is wholly in
adequate "In my Judgment.-" he says, "it pre
cludes this force from being made fit
for war service until It has receivettat
least six months' additional training la
time of war."
The report reiterates the opinion that
it lakes a year of .intensive training: to

training. Gen. Scott the country
faces a serious situation.
Hard to Get Krcruitf.
"And it is very doubtful." he contin
ues, "if we will be sbl to do so and
keep the force recruited. The diffi
culty that is now being experienced in
obtaln.ng recruits for the regular army
ana tor xne national guard in service
on the border, raises sharply tte ques
tion of whether we will be able to re
cruit the troop authorized in the na
tional defence act."
In spite of the fact that the prepar
edness agitation stimulated interest
while the effort now being made to
oring tne ooraer lorces up to war
asserts, three

These children are all Americans,
most of them have either a father or a

working but is not able to care for the
