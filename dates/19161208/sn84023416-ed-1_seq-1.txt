102 YEARS OLD
Isaac Aldrich One of the Oldest
31 on to Cast a Vote at Election.
In the town of Burke lives Isaac
Aldrich, 102 years old, one of the
oldest if not the oldest man to be
present at the polls and to cast his
vote at the last election.
The unusual age to which this
man has attained would not be sus
pected by looking at him, for he has
few of the infirmities usually in
cidental to many years. His hearing
and eyesight are but little impaired,
while his general appearance is that
of activity and vigor. The combined
age of this man and his wife is 198
years.
If any conclusions are to be drawn,
it may be said that this couple have
reached this far milestone in life by
being temperate in all things. , Mr.
Aldrich has used tobacco in modera
tion and is quoted as saying that in
conformity to the social customs of
the present and past times he has
not felt that an occasional use of
stimulants in a reasonable and decent
manner is degrading or criminal.
For many years he was a resident
of the town of Lyndon where he
made and repaired boots and shoes
and engaged in farming.
His first vote was cast for Andrew
Jackson. Since that time he has
with interest followed the many
and varied political questions and
changes which have arisen.
He has a rich store of historical
and other anecdotes dating back to
a time which to most persons of to
day is known only by perusal of the'
printed page.
He has been a democrat all his life
but has never sought office.
WINTERING BEES
Department Recommends That
Bottoms as Well as Sides of
Hives Re Insulated.
Failure to insulate the bottom of
the hive largely offsets the value of
nsulation around the hive in the out
door wintering of been, according to
the annual report of the Chief of the
Bureau of Entomology of the de
partment. Experiments conducted
with a number of insulated hives
showed .that much heat was lort
from the unprotected hive bottom.
Insulating these bottoms was found
to increase their value greatly
Manufacturers, therefore.have been
advised to build insulated hives with
insulated bottoms. According to the
report, the choice of insulating ma
terial is of minor importance, as the
materials commonly used shavings,
sawdust, leaves, and chaff do not
differ greatly in insulating value.
On the subject of insulation, the
entomologist says, in part:
'Beekeepers have repeatedly
claimed that excessive insulation is
even more detrimental jn winter
than insufficient insulatjon, because
of the failure of the colony to warm
un on bright days. To test this the
ory, a colony was packed, in the fal
of 1915. with 16 inches of sawdust
on all sides, top, and bottom. Tern
perature records were made at fre
quent intervals every day through
out the winter and spring. The
colony remained in excellent condi
tion in every respect throughout the
winter and spring. The colony re
mained in excellent condition in every
respect throughout the winter, be
ing little affected by high winds.an
after brood rearing began it built
up with great rapidity, men, to
. 1 1 mi j
continue observations on the effect
! of insulation on the building UP 0;
, . . . . . .
tlie colony, the packing was allowed
to remain all twmmer. Except for
&e impossibility of manipulating
i the colony, it remained in excellent
condition. It stems clear, therefore
that beekeepers need not tear any
detrimental results from abundant
insulation at any season of the year.'

Do It Now, Says a Former Resi
dent Sarah M. Ilobson, M. D.,of
Chicago.
Chicago, November 30, 1916.
To The Herald:
Another oldtime resident of Island
Pond wishes to go on record on the
change of name from Island Pgjid to
Brighton. It is quite true that not
every change is progress. But cer
tainly there is no progress without
change. The name "Island Pond"
is a handjeap because it has to be ex
plained. To change to "Brighton"
would be a temporary inconvenience,
it is true. But that is the only
worthy argument against it.
Brighton identifies the village with
the township; it is short, it is famili
ar, and it has good associations.
There are natural resources enough
in Essex county to make its chief
town a prosperous community. This
is a good time to make the change.
Make it BRIGHTON, and do it now.
