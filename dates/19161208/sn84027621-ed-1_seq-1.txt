COUNCIL HAS REINSTATED
MARSHAL CARTER
The city council met last night in
special session to consider the case of
Marshal R. L. Carter, who was sus
pended by the mayor for twenty days
Wednesday. All but one of the coun-
cilmen were present. ;'..:
There were several charges against
the marshal, but no evidence was pro
duced to support any of them, and Mr.
Carter was reinstated in his office by
an unanimous vote. '
It is most necessary that the ordi
nances governing the pofcce depart
ment be amended. The present regu
lations are productive of a constant
dispute between the mayor and coun
cil. - A number of times in the past
few years, officers have been suspend
ed by the mayor, and though some
times the mayor's acts have been sus
tained by the aldermen, in a majority
of cases they have not. The result
has been to keep the police force in a
very uncertain condition of mind. No
matter how hard an officer may try
to do his duty, he never knows when
he will be suspended, and two or three
days " suspension ja.t present salaries is
no joke. The police force should be
under the direction of the chief, who
should be answerable only to the po
lice committee and it to the council.
The public as well as the force suf
fers by the present system.

ARE REGDMMEN
By the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion in Its Annual Report
. to Congress k
(Associated Iress)
Washington, Dec. 8. The Inter
state Commerce Commission in its
annual report yesterday to Congress
recommended a sweeping change in
methods of establishing freight and
passenger rates so that - shippers
would not-longer be compelled to show
a proposed rate unreasonable or see it
become effective. Carriers seeking to
alter a rate would be compelled to
show the change was reasonable.
The recommendation is "that by
statute Congress fix the interstate
rates? fares, charges, classifications,
rules and regulations existing at a
specific date, prior to that of enact
ment, as just and reasonable for the
past, and provide that no change
therein after that specified date may
be made except upon order of the
commission; with provision that such
statute shall not affect the proceed
ings pending at the time of enact
ment." i ,
The purpose of the suggestion is
said to be mainly to correct flaws in
the present method by which an in
jured shipper seeks reparation for
jayment of a higher rate than sub
sequently is approved by the commis
sion. . v
It was said, however, that the effect
of such legislation would be radical
upon, methods of rate establishment.
At present tariffs proposing rate
changes filed by the railroads be
come operative on a fixed date unless
suspended by the commission : and
shown on hearings to be unreasonable,
unjust or discriminatory. If existing
rates are declared by statute to be
just and reasonable, it was pointed
out, the burden will be on those who
wish to change them. ' ; ?

L REPORT
OF INTERIOR
Public Lands of the United States are
Rapidly Passing Into the Hands
of the People .
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 8.' Public lands
in the United States are being taken
up by homesteaders in rapidly mcres
ing quantities as shown in the annual
report of Secretary of the Interior
Lane made public yesterday. Twenty
million acres were claimed by private
owners in the year ending with June
30, as against seventeen millions for
each of the preceding two yaars and a
still smaller average for previous
years.
Of the two hundred and fifty mill
ion acres of public land still left in
the United States much is in the arid
region. The reclamation service car
ried on construction work on 24 arri
gated projects, completing ) ten and
adding 5,000 farms to territory for
which irrigation water ' is available.
Irrigation water is actually going
now to nearly 20,000 farms.
The report emphasizes the work of
the Indian bureau, whose health cam
paign, it is declared, has cut the death
rate among Indians even in one thou
sand. The bureau has conducted a
campaign to save Indian babies by
giving Indian mothers proper care.
Hospitals were constructed and addi
tional physicians were employed in
the health campaigns.
Work in the Indian schools was re-
vised to reduce the hours of academic
work and to increase the number giv-

A!ID LONG DISCUSSION
BETWEEE2 BEBLIII
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 8. A new note
to Germany on the general submarine
situation, aimed at clearing up appar
ent differences of interpretation here
and in Berlin of Germany's pledges
in the Sussex case, appeared among
the possibilities today, but Secretary
Lansing said the final course was un
decided. ,The United States asked
Great Britain for information regard
ing the status of the British steamer
Arabia, which a German submarine
commander took for an armed trans
pert. Official information to the state
department has established that the
British steamer Marina, with the loss
of six Americans, was hot a trans
port and was not entitled to immuni
ties of a peaceful merchantman. Ger
many has expressed willingness to
make amends in both of these cases
if her pledges had been broken.
en to vocational training. Indian
moneys carried on deposit in state and
national banks during the year, the
report says, amounted to $22,000,000;
new regulations were made for leas
ing oil lands of the Osage nation at
a high rate which, the report esti
mates, in the first year will pay
$700,000 in. royalties; ninety thousand
acres of Indian lands' were " sold for
$1,666,000 and sixteen thousand acres
were purchased for landless Indians.
A section of the .report dealing
with the pension office shows 709,572
names on the pension rolls at the end
of the year, a decrease of 38,575 for
twelve months.. Civil war soldiers on
the rolls numbered 362,277. Deaths
of civil war soldiers during the year
numbered 34,252. The amount paid
for pensions for theyear was $159,
155,000 against $165,518,000 for the
previous year.
A patent office report gives the
number of applications for patents
during the year as " 70,000. Forty
eight thousand were granted.
1 The Bureau of Education report
recommends the formation of a divis
ion of commercial education and a
division for the education of excep
tional children. Investigations are
urged looking to the education of the
adult illiterate, and better education
for the children in the home.
Commendation is bestowed on the
work of the Bureau of Mines in de
veloping methods of testing low grade
complex gold, silver, lead and zinc
ores which, it is claimed, promise to
rejuvenate mining in certain parts of
the country and make valuable mil
lions of tons of ore that now cannot
be treated. The bureau since its or
ganization has trained forty-one
thousand miners in mine. rescue work.
Agricultural possibilities of Alas
ka still are a matter of conjecture,
although in some parts of the terri
tory the hardier cereals and veget
ables are being grown. Completion
of the railroad now being construct
ed from Seward to Fairbanks will do
much for the development of Alaska,
the report says.
