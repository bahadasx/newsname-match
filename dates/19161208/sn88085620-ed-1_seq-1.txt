THE LARGEST IRON ORE DEPOSITS AND
HOW THE STEEL TRUST GOT THEM
By HARRISON GEORGE
It is the custom for an employer
when faced with a demand for a
wage increase, made by organized
labor, to emit loud howls of purse
stricken pain, lo cry "confiscation"
and complain that the "predatory
poor" are rendering valueless his
Immense holdings, into which he has
sunken—at great personal risk —his
life, Irs fortune and perhaps his
"sacred honor."
Let us review in brief just what
this argument is worth when applied
to the U S. Steel Corporation in its
acquirement of the largest iron ore
deposits in the world on the Mesaba
Range in Minnesota.
iron was discovered on the Mesaba
Range in 1800. As the U. S. Steel
Corporation was not formed until
1901, we must deal with those whose
acts led lo its formation. The swarm
of speculators which over-ran the
range upon the discovery of iron ore
can be roughly divided into three
groups: The Merritst and their
friends, a group of local capitalists;
Henry VY. Oliver, a wealthy Pittsburg
man, and the third group, a lot of get
rich-quick pure-or-impure speculators,
who grabbed everything in sight and
then lay on their "ores" waiting for
something to happen. Something did
happen- though not to their liking.
The first question was thai of trans
portation, and the Mcrritts, who were
real developers, built a railroad from
l ake Superior to the range. This re
quired more money than they had, so
they borrowed the necessary cash
from Rockefeller and, with childlike
simplicity, mortgaged their entire in
terestS —mines and railroad —to the
oil king.
The panic of the early '90s came on
and it. together with costly and ill
advised management, resulted in
Rockefeller taking over the whole
works of the Merrltt group. He re
fused to renew the loan and the real
developers were left with empty
hands. The hard times had also
pressed Oliver to the wall and he was
in the way of financial collapse when
approached by the Carnegie Steel
Company, and seeing a way out, he
hurried to Pitsburg.
It was time that the Steel Trust,
the most pitiless exploiter of labor the
world has witnessed, conceived itself
in the mind of Henry Clay Prick,
chairman of the Carnegie Steel Com
pany. SVick knew Oliver needed
money and ho enforced a most amaz
ing contract upon him, which Oliver,
having no alternative but bankruptcy,
accepted. The Carnegie Steel Com
pany loaned Oliver $500,000. lo he
gpi nt in development work. This loan
was secured by mortgage and, of
(nurse, was to be repaid with interest.
Vet ti condition of the loan was that
Oliver must GIVE to the Carnegie
Steel Company HALF OF HIS
PRESENT AND FUTURE HOLD
INGS. In oilier words, Oliver was
held up for half his ore properties,
worth untold millions, and the Car
negie Steel Company afterward to
become the nucleus of the v. s. steel
Corporation, came into control of half
its present vast interests on the
Mesaba Range without costing Car
negie SO MUCH AS A POSTAGE
STAMP!
However, there was further work to
be done, and Prick and Oliver, now
working together, dickered with Rock
efeller and by a contract with Greasy
John secured leases on all the mines
Xi th, feller had taken away from (he
Merrills et al., agreeing, in considera
tion of the small royalty he assented i
111 (26 cents per ton), to ship not less
than 1.200,000 tons of ore each year
over the Rockefeller roads. Rocky
caught them coming and going.
This was a great advantage to Car
negie and Oliver, as the combination
between them and Rockefeller sent
the third group into hysterics of fear
and they fought with one another to
B 0) oul from under. This was just
what Ktiek and Oliver had figured on,
and after much trouble in forcing
Carnegie to aeeept the fortune thus
to be obtained, finally won his consent
and they bought up the best remain
ing locations on the range, acquiring
let what was to be the Steel Trust
incredible riches for a song. Says
Oliver, writing to Carnegie, July 27,
n tin effort to get his assistance:
i desire to Impress upon you that if
i< had not been for our Rockefeller
deal, .\iih the consequent demoralisa
tion caused by the publication thereof,
it w ould QOt have been possible for
m to now secure the other range
properties 1 propose to acquire. Now,
lei a- take advantage of our action
, before a season of good times gives
the ore producers Strength and oppor
tunity to get together." Sure, while
he's down, kick Mm in the slats!
All perfectly legal? Certainly! Or
ganized wealth has always at its el
bow the cringing eorporatoin lawyer
to see that it stays out of jail, though
not. necessarily within the law. The
only one to be accused of lawlessness,
to be convicted on the slightest of
fenses, on the most transparent frame
ups, is always the worker who de
mands a raise, the organizer who
shows the worker the road to power!
This, then, is Hie sum of Steel Trust
control on the Mesaba Range: The
employer, whose capitalization is the
staggering sum of $1,404,000,000, ac
uired the greatest part of its ore
properties without the expenditure of
la single dollar. This gigantic em
ployer, whose dividends this year will
' exceed three hundred millions of dol
lars, refuses the right of its miners to
organize or demand any wage in
crease. This is one of those firms
'who yell "expropriation" when labor
asks for a nicel a day to be added to
its wage pittance, despite that they
hold their property rights in natural
resources by reason of no virtue, by
chicane and by trickery. This is the
firm that backs with its grimy mil
lions the persecution of brave men,
the firm who desires the conviction
on a framed-up murder charge of
Carlo Tresca, Sam Scarlett and Joe
Schmidt —organizers, who brought
their loyalty to labor into the miners'
strike and who are guilty of no other
crime.

UNITED MINE WORKERS
PLAN PENSION SYSTEM
Approximately 400,000 coal miners
in the United States and Canada will
;be relieved from the fear of pauperism
In their old age by the terms of an old
|age pension plan to be submitted to
the next biennial convention of the
United Mine Workers of America by
ja special committee of its members
appointed by President John P. While.
The committee, consisting of Wil
liam Mitchell of lowa, John Hutchison
!of Indiana, and Evan Evans of Illinois,
jis now drafting its final report after
lan investigation lasting four months.
It will advise against the establish
, ment of a home for aged miners, on
the ground that men of advanced
years should be enabled to obtain re
lief without leaving their families and
living In an institution.
A per capita tax of 25 cents per
(month to be levied on the 400,000
members of the United Mine Workers
j during the next five years and the
payment after 1923 of a monthly pen
jsion of $20 to all miners more than G5
years of age, is recommended by the
committee. Miners under 65 years of
age who are incapacitated by accident
and who have no means of support
would receive a like amount. No
miner would be eligible until he had
been continuously a member of the
organization for ten years and had
paid the pension tax for five years.
The committee was appointed by
President John P. White last spring
under authority of a resolution
adopted at the last biennial conven
tion in Indianapolis. Its report will
be acted upon at the next convention
in Indianapolis in January, 1918. It
has visited tho homes for aged union
I members maintained by the Interna
tional Typographical Union at Colo
rado Springs and by the Printing
Pressmen and Assistants Union at
Rogersville, Term., as well as several
homes maintained by fraternal socie
ties and by the government for old
soldiers,
As a resit of Its investigations, the
committee estimates that at least 7000
miners, on the basis of ths present
membership, would be eligible for
pensions tinder the proposed plan. If
a per capita tax of 25 cents a month
Is levied by the next biennial conven
tion, the committee estimates that at
the end of five years, during which no
pensions would be paid, the organiza
tion would have a pension fund of
iff..000.000 principal, the interest on
which would thereafter largely meet
the co,t of the system. Payments
could then be increased, the age limit
lowered or the per capita pension tax
reduced.

EFFECT ON BABYHOOD OF
INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS
That ch'ldrcn's welfare from baby
hood 10 adolescence is hound up with
industrial conditoins is emphasised by
tho recent work of the Federal Chil
dren's Bureau, of which the chief,
.Miss Julia ('. I.athrop, tells in her
fourth annual report made public to
day.
A study of infant mortality in Man
chester, N. H., completed this year,
adds new evidence that when the
fathers' earnings are low or the
mothers work out of the home Hie in
fant mortality rale is exceptionally
high. In Manchester it varies from
one death among every four babies
where fathers earn less than $450 to
one death among every sixteen babies
where fathers earn $1050 or more.
Miss Lathrop's report refers to the
effect of living conditions upon moth
ers and points out that the sickness
or death of the mother lessens the
baby's chances for life and health.
The bureau lias prepared a statistical
study of maternal mortality and finds
thai 15,000 mothers die year by year
in this country from largely prevent
able causes incident to maternity and
tluil the death rate from maternal
causes has not decreased since 1900.
Miss Lathrop says in commenting upon
this fact: "The means of prevention
are the instruction of the mother,
skilled supervision before the birth of
her child, and suitable care during
confinement. But she must have
jalso nourishing food and sufficient
' rest and freedom from anxiety—in
other words, decent living conditions."
Then the bureau has been concerned
with the protection of the child him
' self from premature employment. It
has published ail the child labor laws
in the United States and has com
pleted ;i report on the administration
of the employment certificate system
in New York State. In commenting
upon the new federal child labor law
las marking a distinct advance in tho
|attitude of this nation toward that
one-third of its population which is
under lil year- of age, Miss Lathrop
says:
"Merely k. > •: the breath of life
in children I •■ M ItSS to the nation
unless tin > ai brought on to adult
life trained masters of their full
powers of body and mind. The law is
a national measure and all attainable
information for a belter understand
ing of the ways in which the children
it sets free from labor may be started
it: life should be furnished by a
national study."
"It is a matter of speculation as to
v.hat proportion of children at work
are dependent upon their own earn
ings or support families in whole or
in pari. Also the number of de
pendent chidren now supported by
public and private funds is unknown.
In fact," Miss Lathrop says, "our ig
norance of the whole field of de
pendency is great." The report gives
figures about Philadelphia indicating
Unit the majority of dependent chil
dren are members of families and the
question of protecting them is a ques
tion of family structure and support, j
Preliminary work toward a study of
dependency has been done by the!
bureau, and Miss Lathrop expresses
Hie hope that congress may direct the
Children's Bureau to make a special'
inquiry into the condition of the chil
dren to be affected by the federal law.
HEADS OF INDUSTRY
ARE TO BLAME
"Industry in America is on I war j
basis. It must be put on a peace basis
if the questions agitating industry are
ever to be solved," declared Miss Ida
It Tarbell, teacher, Journalist and
lecturer, at Yottngslown, Ohio, on the
evening of November 22, in an address
under joint auspices of the City
Teachers' Association and the Youngs
town Chamber of Commerce.
"Conditions disturbing industry are
not due to the faulti of workingmen.
but of the managers of many of the
big enterprises," she said. "Too many
employers are trying to run the busi
ness in defiance of the laws of human
Justice and welfare.
"PR>PSf consideration must be
given to the health of the working
people and there must be a fair dis
position of profits, it has been dem
onstrated in some of the big plants of
this country that an equitable wage
is advantageous to all concerned.
There is no reason why this should
not be true In till lines of industry."

THE LANDLORD WE
HAVE ALWAYS WITH US
By SCOTT NEARING
Th" frontier was the economic
shock-absorber of the early American
democracy, it made a place for tlie
ventun some, aggressive discontented
spirits tluil failed lo find a place in
the more closely knit society of Ihe
|older world. The frontier, like the
ocean, was open and free.
So long a there was plenty of un
cultivated land, the men of energy
tin,', thrill could secure a piece of it
for himself, and by dint of hard work
and care he could obtain a living for
his family in fairly direct proportion
lo the amount of work which he was
willing io do. Winn all of the de
sirable pieces nt Mother Earth are
taken into individual possession, the
direct relation between effort and in
come gives place to an indirect re
lation iii which laud ownership be
comes a source of income, Irrespective
of anj effort expended upon it. Land
scarcity enables the man who owns a
piece of it (o exact a rent from th"
man who wishes to use it. Rent can
exist only where the amount of de-
Birable land is limited. If land were
as abundant as air and sunshine, the
landlord might wail lo eternity before
his land would yield him a penny.
Th frontier litis gone and the land
lord has taken ils place in American
life. The landlord is here, there 1 and
everywhere.
The Increase of land values is In
evitable in tlie United States. The
(olal amount of land is limited. Each
Increase in the population of the
country makes a greater demand for
land. Each progressive advance in
civilization which leads to new uses
for the products of the land makes a
greater demand for land, Step by
step the people of the United States
are moving forward and upward -along
the path of developing Civilization.
Step by step they are adding to the
total value of the resources upon
which that civilization depends
The inexorable character of this In
crease in land values becomes more
evident if selected areas of land are
considered. The facts are patent in
the case of an Illinois farm, which
sold in IS.SO for $25 per acre, and in
19*10 for $2."0 per acre. The farm
valued at $1,256,761,980 in 1900, and
at $2.,50|>":1 729 in 1910. The land on

York rose from $3,367,000,000 to
$4,643,000,000 —an increase of more
than one-third In ten years. The
total value of the farm lands in the

Mr, Roberi 11. .Mill-. Secretary,
You are hereby advised thai at the

in vit tv of the failure of the mill
