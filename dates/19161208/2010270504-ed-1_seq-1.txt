In concortod action "and socure prom
ises from farmors thnt they will grow
a yoarly nvoragd of not less than
8,500 acros, which is the minimum os-
s- ag '
of Commerce is concerned, It will at
once interest Itself in tho matter and
will invite tho co-operation of tho bus
iness mon of the valloy towns In th
county. '
The requlrod acreage nood not nec
essarily be all secured In Lincoln
county, as factories do not object to
paying frolght on a cortnln percentage
of the beets shipped within a radius of
fifty miles of the factory.
It seems to us that tho proper thing
to do is to invito farmors and business
men In tho a odd on betwoon tho 'oast
and wost linos of Mie county to at
tend a meeting in this city and discuss
tho factory proposition. It is only by
concortod action that tho required
acreage can bo secured.
As to the possible sito of a fad.'ory,
that Is an after consideration, and'one
that will bo dotermlnod by tho builders.
Tho factory Is needed by the county,
not by some particular town or lo
cality. Good Interest at Revival
