DEAL HEADING MILL
WILL OPERATE AGAIN
The Joseph Deal heading mill will
open again for business next season,
Mr. Deal's representative was here on
Monday to employ laborers to go into
the woods and cut the heading. He
owns a large amount of timber lands
up the river. This will be cut and
floated down the river ready for the
mill next spring and summer. It is
planned to cut enough to ran at full
capacity at least during the summer
and fall. The Deal heading mill was
at one time one of the substantial
business concerns of Paw Paw and it
is refreshing to know that it will
again commence operations. The
property was reported at one time to
have been sold to a company in Toledo
! Ohio, but we understand that Joseph
heal Sr. who owns the property and
that he will personally superintend
the operation of the mill next season.
Scarlet Fever Claims Wini
fred Warner. Nurse
at Hospital
Much sympathy is expressed for Mr
and Mrs. Willard D. Warner who are
heartbroken over the death of their
youngest daughter Winifred, who was
laid to rest in Austin cemetery la.st
Monday morning. The unfortunate
young lady was stricken with scarlet i
fever at the State Hospital in Kala- I
mazoo and was sick but a fev days.
Winifred Warner was born on June
2nd, 1897, and passed out of this life
December 3rd, 1916, at the age of
nineteen years, six months and one
day. From the time of her birth, she
had been sunshine in her home. Her j
even temper, quiet sunny disposition
and christian character won friends
for her, whereever she went. The
first of this year, she began work at
the Michigan State hospital in Kala
mazoo, where she was taking a nurses
and a large circle of devoted friend.;.
The True Northerner joins in sym
pathy to the sorrowing parents.
CARD OF THANKS

friends and neighbors who assisted u ;
during our sad bereavement. We
thank the Riverside Sunday school

GRIM REAPER ENDS
BRIGHT PROSPECTS
,
There are only seventeen more days until Christ
mas. From now until that time this newspaper
will be filled with many attractive features for the
early Christmas shopper. The merchants have
larger and better assortments than ever before and
many elegant, attractive lines have been purchased.
Bach year more and more beautiful presents are
offered the public, and every taste can be readily
supplied right here in Paw Paw if people will come
and make their purchases early. Do your shop
ing at home, trade among the people you know,
where you are assured ot a square deal, and your
conscience will be clear and you will be satisfied.
We desire to impress upon you the necessity of
making a careful and systematic study of the adver
tisements of our merchants from now until Christ
mas just as much as you do of the paper otherwise.
Many times the price of this paper can be saved if
you will make it your business to read carefully the
otters of the business firms of our little city. It is
pleasing to note the artistic window displays of the
various business houses which plainly demonstrates
the thrift and energy of our business people.
Occasionally we hear a slight complaint on account
of carrying so much advertising; but remember,
without advertising there would he no newspaper.
The Northerner is printed all at home, and is filled
with nothing but the best news of Paw Paw and sur
rounding country and the advertisements, besides
being a source of revenue to the publishers, are
mighty valuable to the reader. We will not issue
a special Christmas edition this year, but every
issue from now until Christmas will be a Christmas
edition within itself. Read every issue carefully,
and remember that Christmas seemingly comes one
week earlier this year than usual because Thanks
giving was so afcte. it is imperative that you
hustle.

O. H. P. Sheldon, has voted
in Eighteen Successive
Presidential Elections
The Free Press and Courier carried
the story some weeks ago, of our
venerable townsman, L W. Van Fos
sen who has voted in seventeen suc
cessive Presidential elections. With
out wishing to detract one iota from
the glory of our good friend Mr. Van
Fossen, The True Northerner presents
another voter of Paw Paw, who goeJ
him one better. O. H. P. Sheldon hai
voted in eighteen successive president
ial elections, and from the present in
dication's will be voting in several in
the years to come. Mr. Sheldon's
first presidential vote was for John C.
Fremont in 1848, and he has never
failed to cast a vote in every succeed
ing presidential election. Unlike Mr.
Van Fossen, however, our hero did
not stick to the "Faith" He groped
in the dark and voted the democratic
ticket until the great civil war, when
he saw the "Light" and since that
time has followed the straight and
narrow path, casting his vote each
time for the republican nominee, j
This fact will be a great comfort to
him in later years when he reaches
the autumn of life.
Mr. Sheldon is really a remarkable
man. He will be ninety-two years of
age next Monday, and is as spry to
day as many of the boys barely out
of their teens. He is clear of eye.
reads readily without glasses, is brisk
of step and carries himself as straight
as an arrow. He is well versed on the
current events of the day, and it is
really a pleasure to converse with him
, . . .
on almost any subject. His locks ar"
getting a little white, but he is still
"One of the Boys" and the writer con
fidently expects him to assist in elect
ing a republican president in 1!2..
Here's to the Grand Old Man who will
reach the ninety second milestone of
life's journey next Monday December
eleventh. May he reach the century
mark and then some.

COTERIE SELLING
RED GROSS SEALS
To Assist in the Great Fight
against White Plague.
Buy Liberally.
WAGE NATION WIDE CAMPAIGN
Every Hamlet Contributes
Its Share to Check
the Disease.
The Annual Red Cross Christmas
Seal sale has been started in Paw Paw
The Coterie takes charge of this sale
this year, and its members confident
ly expect to realize a handsome sum
to help swell the fund to continue the
national fight against tuberculosis.
This is a nation wide movement, and
rapid strides have already been made
toward the elimination of this terrible
disease. Last year the national so
ciety realized $800,000 from the sale
of Christmas seals, and this year its
members hope to exceed that sum.
Paw Paw has already done its share
towards the humanitarian project, and
will no doubt do more this year than
ever before.
When some member of the Coterie
calll on you, buy just as liberally as
you feel you can, for every cent that
is realized from the sale of these seals
is turned over to the anti-tuberculosis
(and, and you know that it is money
given in a good cause.
It is not an act of charity alone, for
the seals are pretty and attractive,
and can be used to good advantage in
the w rapping of your Christmas par
cels. There is no revenue in this for the
Coterie. It is simply an act of kind
ness to assit in this great movement.
Do your part by contributing a liberal
amount in the purchase of seals.
