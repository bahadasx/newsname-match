NEW MEXICO STATE RECORD
1.50 A YEAR.
SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8 1916.
NUMBER Ml
SHORT SESSION
' OF CONGRESS
OPENED MONDAY
THE ADMINISTRATION WILL
PUSH THROUGH PARTY
MEASURES BEFORE THE
REPUBLICANS GET CON
TROL OP THE HOUSE
Tim eivhu-fAiirhli ci'c t i fi i nf iUt na
tional congress convened last Mon
.. y for its second short session which
ends the life of that body on March
4th. There is some doubt as to the
Democrats having control of the low
er b,ouse, ami all party measures
will he pushed as rapidly as possi
ble in order to get them through be
fore the Republicans get in.
When congress adjourned last Sep
tember, the democratic, senate cau
cus agreed that the immigration bill,
with its oft-vetoed lteracy test,
would be taken up and passe d before
consideration of any other legisla
tion. It also had agreed to act on
the Owen corrupt practices bill, a
measure to limit expenditures in na
tional political campaigns and to pro
vide new penalties for election
frauds. Both measures had be'n
pressed at tbe end of the session,
to the embarrassment of both part
ies, and were abandoned by mutual
consent d'spife the urgent demands
of a few members.
Eight-hour Law.
Besides those two measures the
memorable eight-hour day fight
which marked the last days of the
last session had ended with legisla
tion suggested by President Wilson
unconsidered. It will be urged upon
th congress by the administration
above all other subjects. In fact
the joint committee created by con
gress to investigate the whole sub
ject of railroad problems- has been
in session two weeks preparing re
commendations and it is apparent
that this will be the dominating
feature of the session.
Estimates for maintaining and
strengthening the army and navy
during the fiscal year 1918, indicate
that congress will be asked this win
ter to promise about $800 000.000 for
that purpose. The total of estimates
already submitted and made public
today when congress convened is
$575,584,560 to cover the military ac
tivities of both departments. State
ments made by navy officials to the
house naval committee, now consi
dering that bill, have foreshadowed,
however, large supplementary esti
mates to be submitted later and a
similiar situation exists at the war
department. The preliminary esti
mate for the army fs $737,074,565 an
increase appropriated for 1917. The
navv total of $379,151,701 is an in
crease of $66,451,146 over 1917 fig
ures. Panama canal fortifications
will take $5,358,300, an increase of
about $300,000.
Estimates of the expense of all
branches of the government for the
fiscal vear, 1918, for which the ses
sion of congress assemb1:ng today
must appropriate funds total $1,268,
715 884. This sum is exclusive of
$.125,355,820 to be appropriated for the
postal service which is expected to
be returned to the treasury by post
al revenue and a sinking fund appro
piiation of $60,748,000 toward the
public dpbt.
The total appropriations for the
fiscal vear, 1917, ending next June,
exclusive of these two items, were
$1,184,157,317. Increases in compen
sation and in numbers of employes
are o be found in the estimatej .-
all t ranches of the government and
to meet that tendency, administra
tion officials have attempted a po
licy of paring down all propostls for
n'w projects with the exceptions of
national defense expenditures to meet
the growth of the country and many
hurdens thrust upon United States
by war.
The greatest increases are, of
course, in the estimates for carrying
out the national policy of defense.
Where the war department's appro
priation for th current year were
$.181 487.802 it estimates this year for
$421,352,447.
The navy appropriation which was
$315,613,781 for the current year,
would, acording to estimate be $382
497,5.16. An estimate of $12,230,356
for the Indian bureau represents an
increase over current appropriation
of $1,262,712. Of that sum $225,000 is
asked to complete construction of a
diversion dam and controlling works
for the Gila river irrigation project
at a sit above Florence, Ariz., and
for beginning construction on canals
and structures to carry the natural
flow of the Gila river to the Indian
lands of the Gila River Indian reser
vation and to public and private lands
in Pinal county, Arizona. Forbegin
ning construction of an irrigation
system for 1768 acres of Indian land
on the Hoop Val!ey Indian Reserva
tion in California $34200 is asked.
Included in the estimates for the
department of the interior an ap
propriation of $398,000, an increase
of $310,000 is submitted for opera
tion and construction of, 'he Un
compahgre valley reclamation pro
ject, Colorado.
Estimates for the postal service
aggregate $325,355,820, an increase of
$2,618,141 over the current year. An
estimate of $1,224,000 is submitted
for international and transportation
of mail by steamboat or other power
boat routes or by aeroplanes and it
is provided that out of this appro
priate the postmaster general
would b authorized to expend not
exceeding $100,000 for purchase, ope
ration and maintenance of aeroplanes
for an experimental aeroplane mail
service between such points as he
may determine.
PRESIDENT RIPLEY OF
A, T. 1 F, MAKES STATEMENT
Mr. E. P. Ripley, president of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe rail-
way, Comrjtny gives out the follow
ing statement in newspapers Decem
ber 5th;
"In the last two years, especially
since the influence of the European
war has been fully felt, our railway
system has enjoyed what appears to
be an abnormal prosperity. The
same factors which surely have pro
duced this prosperity have made sub
stantial increases in the cost of liv
ing, which it is hoped will be tem
porary. In recognition of this con
dition our board of directors have
authorized us to m ike in a I imp sum
the distribution of additional com
pensation equal to ten percent of a
year s pay to all employes wno nave
been in the service of the Atchi3on
Topeka & Santa Fe System for at
least two years and whose annual
condensation is not paid according
i to present or former contract sche
dules. The payments of the amount
thus authorized will be made as
soon as the necessary computation
can be completed. It is estimated
that the amount thus to be distri
buted will be approximately two mil
lions seven hundred and fifty dol
ars. It is President Kipey's inten
tions to have the d stributions made
(luring the holidays."

THE NEXT REUNION OF
SCOTTISH RITE MASONS
The Twenty-third Reunion of the
Co-Ordinate Bodies of the Rite in
this Valley will.be held Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday, February
19, 20 and 21, 1917. This seems a very
opportune time to hold a Reunion.
Those attending may use Sunday for
the going trip and Washington's
birthday for the return trip, losing
only three business days. The Leg
islature also will be in session at
this time.
The Degrees from the Fourth to
the Thirty-second will be conferred
in the usual manner and the usual
elaborate entertainment features ob
served, preceded by a Sacred con
cert and organ recital, at the Cathe
dral Sunday evening.
A large class is expected and many
visitors contemplate attending this
Reunion. The Executive Committee
is already preparing the program and
the Degree workers are ready to do
their best.
For some time past we have hoped
to exceed the Dedication Class in
numbers. This Class numbered sixty
four and was the largest Class ever
receiving the Degrees in this Val
ley. We have approched that number
several times but have not yet equal
led it. The Febraury Class of this
year reached sixty-two and the June
Class fifty-eight. If each member
would make an effort to interest
those of their friends who are wor
thy Master Masons, the coming Re
union would prove the banner Class.

NATIONAL FOREST
GRAZING FEES TO
BE INCREASED
DECISION OF ' THE CHIEF
FORESTER PROPOSES ONE
THIRD INCREASE EFFECT
IVE THE FIRST OF NEXT
MARCH
District Forester Redington has an
nounced that on a decision of the
chief forester it is proposed to make
a one-third increase in grazing fees,
effective March 1, 1917, on a'l the
national forests of Arizona and New
Mexico. Further yearly increases
.ire to be made until 1919, on and
after which donh'c the present rates
:ire to be charged. The proposed in
creases will apply all over the Unit
ed States, and have the approval of
the secretary of agriculture, who has
set February 1, 1917, as the final
date for public hearings on the new
rates.
Commenting on the proposed
changes, which will affect about 3,9(0
stockmen in the Southwest, the js.
trict forester issued the following
statement:
"One of the leading criticisms of
the national forests is that they are
not self-supporting. This change wj
make them so. It is also' often as
settled that while timber is sold at
competitive market prices, the graz
ing privileges of the forests are dis
posed of at merely nominal rates.
"It is argued that due to these low
rates forest stockmen have an undue
financial advantage over those who
must buy or lease outside lands fur
the:r stock. This advantage is re
jected in the fact that in sales of
forest stock, where the owner waives
.his grazing privilege, the buyer often
freely pays a bonus or premium over
and above the market value. Such
premiums have often been as high
as $1.50 per head for sheep ad $10
for cattle."
1 The present forest rates, based on
a 48-ccnt rate per head per year for
cattle, average, according to Mr. Red
ington, about 35 percent of the rates
paid for grazing on similar private
lands. The proposed increase will
bring them to about 66 per cent of
the rates paid on such lands.
It is pointed out that the increase
in forest receipts which will result
from higher grazing fees will re
dound to the benefit of the state
roads and schools. Arizona and New
Mexico receive yearly by congres
sional enactment 42 per cent of the
receipts from the national forest for
roads and schools. Heretofore this
fund has amounted to about $170,000.
With the higher grazing fees, it is
expected that the annual percentage
accruing to the state will be increas
ed by at least $100,000.
COLFAX COUNTY
GAME PROTECTIVE
CLUB ORGANIZED
HAS APPLIED TO BECOME
AFFILIATED WITH NEW
JKEXICO GAME PROTECT
IVE ASSOCIATION OFFI
CERS ELECTED

Officers of the Albuquerque Asso
ciation express themselves as highly
gratified to see Colfax County join

plished a great deal of active work

jrnra! tenclrrs in this country with

no professional training. There is
ore state in the Union that hns nvee
4oiH! teachers, with only a seventh-
glad' education and no-profession-al
training, in charge of its rural
schools this year. There are sev
eral states that number their rural
teachers in this class by the thou
