ship, has brought tin- Issue over sub
marine wurfap; to a tnor? serious ami
??lear-ut basis than anything that has
happened since the tlirent ?.f the Cnited
States to break diplomatic relations
after the. torpedoing of the channel
liner Sussex last April.
Such Information as thr American
i?ovi>rnmi>nt now has shows the Arabia
to have been a passenger ship of the
I *ninsular atul Oriental Dine, passing
? through the Mediterranean on a r'Rii
lar \oyage. Among the many passen
gers was an American citizen, who was
resetted.
The i ;? rman note, whic h was made
public to-day by the department, says

that the VSH.-I u?s an ordinary pas

which the German government would

The note has been referred to Presi
dent Wilson, who in considering per
sonally a review 01 recent German sub
marine activities to which the Arabia
(.-.-.ho come, ilM )t climax. There prob
ably will be no immediate action, as
the Stave Department first must clear
up beyond question the exact status
of the liner at the time of the attack.
Then It would be for the President to
decide the Course to be followed.
In official quarters the <;erm,tn ex
planation (? regarded as we-,k and un
satisfactory. no weight being attached
to the statements that the Arabia was
painted like a transport and was fol
lowing a route usually taken by trans
ports. and that the submarine rom
mander saw many Chinamen, but no
women and children aboard her. It is
realized, however tnat if official data
finally establishes the Innocent charac
ter of the vessel. In view of the Sussex
case, virtually only one action remains
open to the t'nlted States, and that
would not he taken until every possible
consideration had been given Ger
ititiny'8 position.
While Secretary Lansing himself re-'
fused nil comment to-day beyond the
mere publication of the note, It is
known authoritatively that Germany'*
admission In the Arabia case, her simi
lar admission In the Marina .-ase, when
six Americans were drowned, and the
early facts in the sinking of the Amer
ican steamer Chemung, have combined
to create much anxiety. The temporary
quietude in submarine operations which
followed the pledges in the S.tssex case
apparently has been dispelled, and offi
cials are recalling the belief then an
nounced that submarine warfare is
"utterly incompatible with the prin
ciples of humanity, the long-established
and Incontrovertible rights of neutrals,
and the sacred immunities of noncom
bntants."

of living pointed with Increasing: di

the soaring prices of certain necessi

I campaign started by Miss Chirp. A. Iiiil,

the relief of children in Belgium, is
! meeting with remarkable success.
Pledges received assure the care of
more than 500 children for one year,
the first three days' total exceeding
$4,000.
The campaign was started by Miss
Hill because the American Commission
reported that 600,000 children In Bel
gium were becoming tubercular and
contracting kindred diseases from lack
of food and clothing. The committee
said that' for $1 a month It could pro

BOYCOTT IS IN FULL EFFECT'
More Than 500 Richmond House

With extensive plans being made by
the Housewives" Lentil* of Richmond j
for a vigorous advertising campaign I
supporting the boycotts against tur- j
keys and egks f?r u period of two
weeks, and consumers of this
city pledged against the purchase of
these two commodities, there was no 1
material ehange in the foodstuff situ
ation in Richmond last night. There
were evidences, however, from rnnrket ?
reports, of unsteady conditions result- \
InR from the boycotts.
Market conditions wre reported yes- j
terday ufternoon in Cary .Street as fol
lows:
"Poultry continues dull, and market
very unsatisfactory. It is hard to tell '
what anything will bring now, as nil
buyers are ve-y much upset. by the
determined efforts on the part of con
sumers to force prices down.
"Hsu*?Receipts much heavier this
week and prices lower; outlook uncer
tain.
"Butter?All grades continue in good

In the Richmond Produce Market pre.
pared for The Times-Dispatch by <i. R.

the limitations on e^gs dropped yester
day from <0 to 4? "tnts to 3S to 40
cents, wholesale.

The Housewives' I.eague has in
creased Its membership during the past
two da> s by more than 200 consumers
In Richmond, making a total member
ship of more than 000. Kroin several
printing establishments and the Typo
graphical Union the league received i
yesterday between 6,000 and 6,000 cir
culars and folders, which will be dis
tributed in the ht.nes of Richmond by
Hoy Scouts. Cards will also be placed
in the stores and stre<*t cars.
Members of the lo-'al league are
strongly interested in the Federal in
vestigation of the high cost of living, j
and sent the following telegram to
Senatori Martin and Swanson at Wash
ington:
"We urge active participation in the
present investigation of excessive food
prices."
No fairly general quotation on eggs
could be secured in Htch&iond yester
day afternoon, the prices varying con
siderably in the wholesale trade ac- '
cording to the quantity purchased.
Fresh eggs' K'Aim quoted :it 40 cents per
dozen, wholesale, and the cold storage
commodity at from 35 to .*!? cents, ac
cording to grade, after having been
thoroughly "c nulled." i 'n nmlssinn men
guaranteed tb-se egus as entirely re
liable.
In the retail trade, cold-storage eggs
were selling at from 37 to 39 cents per
dozen, while fresh country eggs were
bringing generally from 40 to 4r> cents.
The popular price was 45 cents, with
several stores charging 48 cents and
a few 50 cents. In the last two in
stances. however, the dealers claimed
that their suppliets were direct from
the farmers, and were of extra fancy j
variety.
Tl'HKKVS CO.VTI.M K AT
A HOLT SAMK IMtlC'E
Turkeys continued at about the same
price, although less than at Thanks
giving. Choice live turkeys were
quoted wholesale at 22 cents, others at
20 to 21 cents; fancy dressed at 24 to I
25 cents; choice dressed. 23 to 24 cents, I
and small turkeys at 20 to 22 cents.
Despite the boycotts declared by the
Housewives' League, the egg market
held its high prices yesterday, espe
cially the retail trade, with fresh coun
try eggs selling at practically the
same prices that have prevailed for a
week. Cary Street reported a dull
market, with a slight tendency to de
clining prices. Varied opinions were
found in wholesale and retail circles
as to the wisdom of the drastic steps
taken by the consumers of Richmond
and to the probable benefits to be de
rived from such action.
Commission men generally were op
posed to the boycotts, asserting that
no two commodities should be singled j
out when practically every foodstuff
was equally as high, and in many in
stances selling at far greater prices
in proportion. To break the prevailing
prices, they said, so that the working
man would benefit, attention should be
given to the entire list of commodities
used by the householder daily.
While great complaint is being made '
against the prices of cold-storage eggs,)
they assert that they are selling for
less in Richmond by the single crate
than in Chicago and other ' cities by!
the carload. Several dealers became
slightly indignant, believing that the
public was holding them responsible
for the high prices, when, they said,
they could ship their supplies to other
cities and realize greater profits.

There is no attempt being made to
keep up the prices, it was said, and
the farmers are receiving the differ- j
ence between the quotations of to-day !
and last year, with the. commission
merchants receiving only their regular
commission on sales.
On the other hand many supporters
of the boycotts were found among the
business men and several retail denl
ors declared thomselves to be heartily j
In favor of the movement, asserting
that they only wished the prices of ;
all other commodities could bo forced !
down to a normal basis.
Commission m?n directed attention

STILL RETREATING

WITHOUT ANY FIGHTING

( By Associated Press. 1
The Roumanian army at last reports
was still falllnpr back all along the
line east of Bukharest from the Tran
sylvanlan Alps to the Danube. Just
where it will stop and. with its Rus
sian allies, make a stand against thes
Teutonic allies, hus not yet become ap-.
parent. On the Moldavian west fron
tier and farther north along the Ruko
wlna border the Russian attacks
against the Austro-Gertnan forces have
failed to make any impression.
An official communication from Ber
lin says Bukharest was captured with
out any fighting except by the Rou
manian infantry north and west of the
capital. This resistance was quickly
overcome. It is stated, and the Invaders
entered the town from all sides, being
received enthusiastically by the popu
lace and decorated with llowers.
On none of the fronts is a sanguinary
battle in progress. For the most part
the artillery wings of the belltiiercnt
armies are doing the greater portion of
the work. Berlin reports that the Bul
garians have forced back the British
in the Struma River lowlands near
Seres, in Macedonia, and that the Bul
garians and Germans have compelled
the evacuation by the Serbs of posi
tions they had previously captured near
Trnovo, in the, Cerna River sector.
West of Lutsk, in Volhynia. the Teu
tonic allies have captured Russian po
sitions and successfully withstood
counterattacks.
The Viennil War Office reports that
the Italians, after a vigorous bombard
ment, launchel two attacks on the
Carso front of the Austro-Italian thea
ter. but that both of them were re
pulsed.
Artillery duels and exploits, by raid
ing parlies continue on the fronts In
Belgium and France. The Germans
and French are engaged in a spirited
artillery battle In the region of hill
304, northwest of Verdun, where the
Germans Wednesday gained some
ground.
An explanation of the military ac
tivity of the Greeks has been demanded
by the. British, French, Italian and
Russian ministers at Athens, accord
ing to an unofficial dispatch.

BUKLIN, December 7 (via London>.
?The fall of Bukharest. announced
here yesterday, was observed in a man
ner reminiscent of the celebrations last
year of victories won in the great of
fensive against the Russians.
The newspapers issued extra editions
which wer? scattered among the
crowds free of charge, and read with
the greatest eagerness.
A merry mood seized the crowds in
the streets, which gave vent to pent-up
emotions with shouts of Joy. Soma
women were so overcome that they
wept. The restaurant# were tilled with
crowds uproariously singing patriotic
airs. To-day the streets are decked
lavishly with flags.
The newspapers speak of the cap
ture of Bukharest as an event of first
importance, chiefly on account of the
moral and political effects. It is re
garded as a demonstration to the en
tente allies of the hopeless outlook for
their military plans.
The newspapers are unanimous in
the opinion that Roun\ania is now vir
tualij eliminated as a factor In the
war.
The Lokul Anzeiger even doubts
whether the Roumanian state ever wilt
exist again.
