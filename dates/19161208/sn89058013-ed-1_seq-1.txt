. Raising pure 'seed or any crop
requires more than average intelli
gence andkill.1 But there is a de
mand for that skill to show, itself
on every farm in Tennessee'. Pure
bred seed is being called for, as is
seen in several letters received by
the division of extension.: Qne of
these letters was f rom Dea Mornes,
Iowa. It asked for the names of
persons in . Tennessee who could
supply sorghum seed inquantities.
J. C. Mc Amis, specialist in crops
of the Division of Extension of the
University of Tennessee, sent the
names of allthe West- Tennessee
farmers which he had at' hand as
producers of sorghum seed. There
were seven who raised Honey Sor
ghum; three raised Sugar Drop;
three, Amber one, Goose" Neck;
one, Orange. . r -Earlier
in the season there was a
big call for barley seed from' farm
ers in Tennessee, who had not been
growing the kind of barley that
they wanted to grow. As the fields
begin to look like they are ready
to grow4 more crops : and as tha
farmers anticipatejheir years work
there is a demand for good seed.
More farmers could produce seed
for the general market and etill not
meet the demand." - -

The probability, of a strike- on
the Nashville, Chattanooga and St.
Louis Railway has practically been
removed by the action of President
John Howe. Peyton in agreeing to
the suggestion of G. W W; Hanger
of the Federal Board of Mediation
that.the railroad officials meet the
joint committee of the four Broth
erhood' organizations to consider
grievances. ...
After setting out the substance
of the agreement in a statement
following his conference with Mr.
Hanger, which statement was given
to the Associated Press, President
Peyton issued the' following state.
men to the public;
Nashville, Tenn., December 3,
.". To the Public A memorandum
has just been issued to the news
paper reporters of conclusions
reached by Mr. Peyton as to the J
question upon which employes on
the I7ashvillelX!ha(tanooga and St.
Louis Railway recently took a
strike vote, i. e., the demand of the
representatives-of the four orders
of trainmen that in considering
grievances affecting a member of
any of : the orders, the general
mauager should discuss same with
a joint committee of the four orders.
Mr. Peytou wishes to say to the -public
that in reaching .this con
clusion his mind was influenced by
t?eueral conditions affecting the 1
country; the fact that the question ;
of meeting the four organizations'
jointly really is not of very material .
importance, except for its bearing
upon the general question of the
sanctity of contracts; the fact that
a strike just now would cause' a
great deal of suffering aiong the '
lines of the railroad, particularly
in towns and communities entirely
dependent ' upon tins "system for
their supply of coal, the stock of
which is at a minimum throughout
the country, and by the further f act
that the Congress assembles to
morrow and that the President of
the United States, in1 an address 7
before a joint session of the two :
houses of Congress on August 29,
1916, gave the assurance that laws
would be passed tha would in'the'
future prevent such' catastrophes -overwhelming
the country."
