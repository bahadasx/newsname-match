The Marketing
Of Potatoes
Greater Care Necessary in Dig
ging and Handling, Say Specia
lists Standardization Needed.
In order that the present large losses
of potatoes may be eliminated and that
conditions in the potato-growing indus
try may be bettered in general, grow
ers should exercise more care in dig
ging and handling the tubers, should
work toward the establishment and
strict observance of grades, and should
carefully study marketing needs and
conditions. This is the advice of spe
cialists of the Office of Markets and
Rural Organization of the department
in a recent publication, Farmer's Bulle
tin 753, Commercial Handling, Grading,
and Marketing of Potatoes.
Early and Late Potatoes
There are two definite crops of pota
toes in this country each year: The
southern early, or "new" potatoes,
which are perishable, and the northern
late potatoes, which are enly semiper
ishable. The treatment of these crops
must differ considerably. In tfce South,
digging begins in Florida, Texas, and
southern Louisiana in May and is done
v mostly by forks and plows. In some of
the hotter sections it has been found
advisable to plow up the potatoes in
the late evening and pick them early
the following morning. Picking into
rectangular, open-slatted crates, the
slats having rounded edges, has been
found most satisfactory. The potatoes
should not be hauled loose in wagons,
since such treatment may bruise them
seriously. For shipment the southern
potatoes are packed in hampers and
double-headed barrels in Florida, and
in barrels with burlap covers in other
states along the Atlantic coast, In
Texas sacks are used.
Grading for the southern potato crop
has been rather extensively adopted
with good results, the graded potatoes
bringing better prices. Mechanical
graders are used in some sections.
The marketing of the southern crop
is effected largely through cash buyers
at shipping points. Shipments are also
made through distributors and , on con
signment to agencies in distant markets
In some sections, it was found, cooper
ative associations of growers handle
the marketing, achieving successful re
sults. One of the largest of such asso
ciations operates along the eastern
shore of Virgina. This association sold
over six million dollars worth of pota
toes in 1914. This organization, like
others of its kind, grades strictly and
makes use of definite brands for the
best grades of potatoes. It insists that
the potatoes bearing its brand shall be
bright, free from second growth, dis
ease, and other defects. Scabby, worm-
eaten, or sunburnt potatoes are barred.
Associations operating on the same
general plan exist in most of the other
Southern States.
Northern Potato Crop
Northern, or 1 te potatoes, are dug in
August and September. Forks are
used to a certain extent for digging this
crop, but most of the acreage is dug by
plows and digging machines. For the
successful use of the latter, soil condi
tions must be good. Under favorable
conditions the use of such machines has
been found profitable. There is much
loss from bruising potatoes in all types
of digging. Deep plowing with plows
and machines should eliminate most of
such losses.
Picking in the North is mostly by
hand, but some combination digging
and picking machines are in use. If
the potatoes are to be graded as picked
growers should carefully instruct pick
ers in the work, since the inclusion of
a few diseased, cut, or defective pota
toes is sufficient to discount an entire
shipment, the selling value being large
ly determined Dy tne poorest tubers in
the lot rather than the best. Even the
I less perishable northern crop may be
injured by hauling from the field loose
in wagons. This practice usually in
volves subsequent handling, often with
shovels and scoops, which further
bruises the potatoes. A good practice,
say specialists of the department, is to
pick the potatoes into open-slatted
crates and haul the filled receptacles to
storage or grading houses or to cars.
Grading
. Many sizing machines are used in the
North to grade potatoes and, since they
7 give more accurate results than hand
grading, their use should be extended
In additionyto sorting, these machines
are of service in removing dirt. This
is an important fact, since there are
many complaints by buyers of the pre
sence of dirt among potatoes, and
greater allowances are being demanded
in price adjustments on this account.
The mechanical sizcr simply sorts as to
size and tne stocK musi De iurmer
graded by hand to eliminate potatoes
affected by sunburn, dry-rot, scabs,
frost or other defects.
All grading should be done preferably
on the farm. If the grower .ships un
graded stock to market, it must be
graded there where labor is more cost
ly. In addition to paying, in lower
prices received, for this labor, he also
pays freight on the rejected potatoes
and loses the culls, which he might
have utilized on the farm. Grading is
facilitated where the grower has suffi
cient storage space for a large part of
his crop. In this way potatoes which
do not show the effects of frost orother
damage when first dug may be detect
ed later and sorted out before the crop
is marketed. If the potatoes are ship
ped without sorting, the damageusual-
ly brings about rotting of the injured
potatoes before the market is reached
and reduces prices on the whole ship
ment.
Standardization
In the bulletin already mentioned,
the specialists of the department do
not make specific recommendations for
the adoption of standard grades, but,
for the assistance of those interested in
bringing about standardization, they
suggest that two regular grades and
perhaps a special grade for extra fancy
potatoes should meet market needs. It
is suggested that specifications for the
No. 1 grade should be drawn to make
it as good and attractive in appearance
as is reasonable and practicable. These
specifications should practically elimin
ate potatoes damaged by frost, sunburn
blight, common scab, dry rot, decay,
second growth, cuts, bruises, dirt and
also undersized or coarse stock. The
mimimum and maximum sizes for both
No. 1 and No. 2 grades are still a sub
ject for careful investigation, discus
sion, and demonstration. However, a
mimimum of about 2 inches is main
tained for grade No. 1 in a number of
early or 'new" potato sections, ano
the commonly discussed mimimum for
this grade is from one and seven-eights
to two inches, The minimum diameter
for a long variety should probably be a
little smaller' than for a round one.
Since it is practically impossible in
grading any perishable products com
mercially to secure a perfect grade,
reasonable tolerances should be allow
ed. The No. 2 grade should include
the better of the remaining potatoes.
The studies of the market specialists
of the department indicate that there is
an unnecessary diversity in the con
tainers for potatoes in use. These now
range from the 1-bushel hampers for
the early Florida crop to double-headed
barrels. The 2-bushel, or 120-lb,
burlap bag is suggested as perhaps the
most satisfactory container for general
use. lhe lack of proper grading and
packing, the specialists say, causes a
large part of the marketing difficulties
now experienced in the potato trade.
Marketing.
Marketing conditions in the North
differ widely from those in the South,
since about three-fourths of the crop is
stored. Local buyers, warehousemen,
and distrffiutors are the chief factors in
marketing the northern crop. The
bulletin already mentioned lists eight
methods of selling that growers may
adopt. These are: In the field, for
cash by the load at the car, to cash
traveling buyers in car lots, to local
warehousemen, through distributors,
by wire, on consignment to a broker or
merchant, or through cooperative
marketing organizations. The bulletin
also discusses the outlets for distribu
tors and methods of railway billing.
Loony Limericks
There once was a small lad named Foyt
Who thought that a gun was a toy;
When they scraped them together
They didn't know whether
There was more of the gun or the boy.
There was a young woman named Run
yons,
Who had eighty-four' corns and two
bunyons,
She limped when she walked,
And lisped when she talked,
For she'd knots on her tongue big as
onions.
A banana peel, blithsome and gay,
Crept out on the concrete highway;
Forty people slipped down,
Said the peel 'with a frown:
'Why is everyone angry to-day?'

AGRICULTURAL CON
GRESS FOR
CHARLEVOIX COUNTY
Still a Chance for this County to
Land the 1917 Meeting.
As the place of holding next year's
sessions of the Central and Northern
Michigan Agricultural Congress is still
in the hands of the executive committee
there is a good chance for Charlevoix
County to draw the meetings here.
Cadillac had the first Congress, Lud
ington the second, and some town in
this section is the logical place for the
next.
That this big conference of agricul
tural experts is- important and worth
any effort to secure is proven by a
Statement of the names of the men
whose names appeared on the program.
R. II. Ellsworth, extension specialist
in marketing, stated that- he believed
that there was a greater array of talent
in attendance at the second Northern
Michigan Agricultural Congress than
ever congregated at any like meeting
in Michigan. There were several pro
fessors from the state agricultural
college together with other experts in
the problems of present day agriculture
The names with some of the topics
discussed follow. They are:
W. 0. Hedrick, professor of econo
mics, M. A. C The Farm Loan Law.
H. J. Eustace, professor of horti
culture, M. A. C Fruit Growing and
Marketing in the West.
M. M. McCool, professor of soils, M.
A. C. Soils of Northern Michigan.
R. J. Baldwin, director of college
extension, M. A. C Agricultural Ex
tension Schools.

COUGHED FIFTEEN YEARS
Coughs that hang on and grow worse
in the night are relieved bv Folev's

with a troublesome bronchial cough
and irritation of the throat. Foley's
Honey and Tar relieved me; and after
taking one bottle the cough ceased"

AGRICULTURAL
EXTENSION
' SCHOOLS
Ironton Has Been Selected For
One In March.
One of the many means used by the
Michigan Agricultural College in bring
ing modern agricultural methods and
the results of scientific research in
farm problems to the people of the
state 4s the agricultural extension
school. These schools are promoted
by the director of college extension,
Mr. R. J. Baldwin of East Lansing. The
extension department has on its staff
the twenty -six county agents, the field
agents from the various college depart
ments, the women demonstrators from
the domestic science department, and
the state leaders of boy's and girl's
clubs. The schools are conducted by
some two'or three of the members of
the college extension staff and lasts for
five days. Several topics of local im
portance are covered by lectures and
demonstrations. All interested farmers
who enroll for the work are expected
to attend regularly and help with the
demonstrations.
The community desiring an exten
sion school makes application for the
same to the director of college exten
sion. There is no expense connected
except hall rent, fuel, etc. This is
borne by those attendtng the school.
Counties employing a county agent are
given first consideration in placing
these schools, for the county agent acts
as local manager, and experience has
shown that schools in such counties are
always most successful.
Director Baldwin has signified his in
tention of giving this county an exten
sion school to be held early in March at
Ironton. This may be considered a
recognition of the progressiveness of
Charlevoix county farmers and all are
urged to give the school in return the
very best support possible.

VAN PELTS TOURING DIARY
The Bancroft, Worcester, Mass.
Tuesday, Oct. 3, 1916.
Another beautiful day for the two
boy tourists and our journey together
is fast drawing to a close. We left
North Adams, Massachusetts, at eight
a. m. to cross the mountains on the
great National Mohawk trail, and in
order to give your readers a far better
description than I could possibly give,
I am sending the editor of this paper a
little booklet, gotten up by the pro
prietor of the Mansion House, Green
field, Massachusetts, which will tell
you more about it in ten minutes than
I could write in ten years.
By the way, I stopped at this hotel
over fifty years ago one night every
four weeks for some four or five years,
and its just the same good old hotel,
but much improved in many ways.
Now, to go back to our trip. The
day was perfect and the view, as we
crawled up tne mountainside, was
truly grand. We laid over a couple of
hours at the Greenfield Mansion House
and then drove to Worcester, Massa
chusetts, passing through Athol, Peter
sham and Barre. This hotel excels any
on the route. There are two places
we will never stop again Troy, N. Y.
and North Adams, Mass. The road
over the mountain cost about $315,000
00 to build and is about twelve miles
long. The balance of the way through
Shelburn was only fair, but from
Greenfield here it was fine. Good
night the two boys are getting tired
and are ready to be put to bed.

Chemung was sent to the bottom off
the coast of Spain and her crew left to
shift for themselves in open boats. A
number of Petoskey people will re

was wcelsman on the craft for some
time and while he has been an "on
shore's man" for many years he has
kept in touch with this ship. She was
taken to the Atlantic last summer for
the ocean service. A number of other
Petoskey men also remember her,
having aided in loading and unloading
operations at Mackinaw City docks in
her early days. Petoskey News.

"Michigan's Gone Dry!"
There is sadness in the bar-room,
And the bar-keep's shedding tears,
And he's rather lost his chuckle
As he's serving up the beers.
And tle bunch that hang about him
bympathetically sigh,
For John Barleycorn's been walloDed.
And the state is going dry.
There's rejoicing in the cottage,
And there's gladness in the house
That has known the wobbly footsteps
And the vileness of a souse.
And the patient wife and kiddies
See their troubles passing by,
For their greatest foe is dying,
Now the state is going dry.
There is weeping now where laughter,
Lewd and ribald, used to reign,
And there's laughter in the dwellings
That were ruled by want and pain.
Now the sorrow's where it should be.
And the glad smiles homeward fly,
And this life seems bright with promise
For the state is going dry.
Let the bar-flies do the wailing:
It's the children's time to smile;
It's the time for patient mothers
To be merry for a while.
Long enough the home's been gloomy;
It's the bar-keep' time to cry, . ...
And the pinch is where it should be,
Now the state is going dry.

Make the Home Bright '
The interior decorations of a man 'a
home may have much to do with his
domestic happiness or unhappiness, as
the case may be, according to the sec
retary of the International Association
of Master House Painters and Decora
tors. The depressing effect of dark
colors in wood finish and wall paper
has wrecked homes which would have
been happy had the colors Been bright,
is the opinion of this expert.
"Dark colors in home decorations are
like dark, gloomy days in their effect
on people," he said. "It is well known
that gloomy days are commonly known
to the police as 'suicide days.' There
are many more suicides, murders and
other crimes on rainy days. A man
owes it to his family to surround it with
bright rooms which will catch all the
sunshine there is and turn it into
domestic happiness.
A room done in dark colors has the
same effect on persons enterincr it as
utter darkness. One's senses cannot
be so active as in bright surroundings,
and there is a loss of buoyancy that
breeds grouches, with all their disas
trous results. Bright, clean, open
minds are the sure result of bright sur
roundings." Kansas City Star.
An authority that speaks from exper- .
ience with reference to the matter ad
vises the farmers of the section of
Michigan against the practice of cover
ing up their potatoes with potato
vines after the harvest. This is a sure
way of spreading late blight, it is stated.
The fungus apt to be present in any
field will be washed from the vine to
the seed thereby affecting many pota
toes. Don't use the old vines on any
part of your potato covering. Cadillac
