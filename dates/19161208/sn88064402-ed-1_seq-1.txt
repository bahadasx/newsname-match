MISSION BEGINS TODAY
AT CATHOLIC CHURCPi
The Catholic chu:ch is furnish ,
with new 1;ews which add a great de o
to the beauty of the edifice, and to
the comfort of those attending th:e
services. The pews were made by the
Lake Charles Planing Mill Co., aid
ai c up to the staniard of neat and
substantial workmanship of th t
concern. The design is of the ti;
Gothic periodl, like tho luildinn, a stye
very decorative without intricnte linig.
The whole makes for elegance aid
comfort,; Their management fine
comfort. Their arrangement is in
tended to use all of the available
space for seating capacity, and accom
modate the ever increasing attendan e
at the Sunday mass.
A mere suggcstion of th2 priest to
the effect was immediately responder
to by a generous subscription among
the congregation, and that substan
tial improvement became an accom
plished fact.
The new pews, together with as
many old ones as can be located with
in the church will provide seats for a
large attendance during the mission.
Rev. Father A. Hochard, the mis
sioner, will say the first Mass at 7:3t
a. m. Friday and preach at the 2nd
Mass at 10:00 a. m., The evening
services will begin at 7:30 p. m. every
d(lay from December 8th to December
17th.
Come to the Mission.

A WELSH NEGRO APPLY.
ING FOR A PARDON
We note that Belaire Kelley, who
was convicted about three years ago
from this parish is applying for a
pardon to the State Board of Pardons.
The Welsh Journal, and its Editor
sincerely hope that the Board will see
Sits way clear to recommend this pool
devil of a negro to the Governor for
a full pardon. There are few of his
I race who stand better with the white
people than he did up to the time of
his conviction, and the general opin
ion seems to be that he has suffere
sufficiently for the offense even
though he were guilty. The negrt
with whom he had the difficulty and
who immediately afterwards escaped,
bore a shady reputation. Belizaire was
.a victim of cirucmstance, and we join
with those who have signed a peti
tion being circulated in his behalf in
irging his full pardon.
M U1CH ACTIVITY IN
JEFF DAVIS PARISH
The 1916 rice harvest is over, and
much of the product has been market
ed. From the activity in all lines of
business it is evident that the year
has been a very successful one for the
farmers, and it is very apparent that
these progressive agriculturists look
forward to a greater success in 1917.
'This is evidenced by the heavy traf
fic in lands, mules, horses and other
live stock, gas tractors, farm machin.
ery and automobiles.
Anticipation of an efficient system
of good roads is, of course, responsi
ble for a great dteal of this activity,
in many ways. The construction of
th- system of roads means a great
amount of labor, the pay for which
the people of the parish hope to keep
it home, in as much as possible. This
work is beginning and will be in full
blast in a very short time, and it is
reasonable to expect that the 1917
rice crop will come to market over
gravel roads. By the time the next
Thanksgiving rolls around the good
people of Jefferson Davis parish will
have cause to rejoice over the fruits
of their progressive endeavor.
SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION.
The matter of general education in
this country has reached a point
where more and serious consideration
will have to be given the question of
consolidation of rural schools.
Of one fact there can be no ques
tios, our country has reached a per
iod in its history 'whdb its people
must be given education. Ignorance
and illiteracy are no longer compati
ble with twentieth century life.
Every person at all familiar with
-nnditions under which these condi
tions are maintained, knows that un
der these conditions it is absurd to
even hope that a child may obtain a
oompetent education therein. With a
school house to every two -or three
miles of territory, dividing up the at
tendance and multiplying the num
ber of teachers, two unavoidable con
sequences result-terms are shortened
and inferior teachers are employed.
It is a fact, patent in all intelligent
observers, that to attain to any pro
ficiency in teaching, the person must
choose this as his or her life work,
and must labor to equip themselves
for efficient service. To this end
there must be sufficient inducement.
The utter absurdity of a three or
four months term at $25 or $30 per
month furnishing that inducement, is
plain to all.
One of the greatest possible detri
ments to the proper education of a
child is an incompetent teacher, and
that.the conditions just described are
fast flooding the land with a lot of
incompetents is plain to all. And
the child is the sufferer. Where he
should be rightly and thoroughly
grounded in all the different branches,
in reality he frequently has but an
imperfect, and sometimes even a
wrong groundmark to build on,'the
results of which are seen in the woe
fully inefficinet lives of so many of
our people.
Again, it is too plain even for ar
gument, that no community can edu
cate its children on three and four
months terms of school. Practically
the entire accumulations of the short
term are forgotten during the long
vacation.
'There are, then, two indisputable
requisites to the proper education of
our rural population-competent in
structors and school terms suffic
iently long. Of course, in the densely
populated districts, schools can be
maintained of sufficient size to guar
antee the length of term, as this de
pends almost entirely on the per cap
ita, and given the term, with an ade
quate salary, the competent teacher
is easily secured and the children's
best interests conserved.·
But in the sparsely settled dis*
icts this is not the case, and here
"riss the imperative need of consoll.
dation-reduclng the number of
schools, therby increasing the funds
available of each,thus insuring the de
sire results of a l6nger term and
more competent teacher.
As tolust how eonsolidation may
best be accomplished, must be left
almost entirely to local conditions to
determine. The public conveyance
lan is working well in many see
on s deve4ppment of good roads
