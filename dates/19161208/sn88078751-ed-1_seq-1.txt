ARTISTS, PUN
FESTIVAL
famous Soloists To Be Ob
tained For (xonnoti's
Opera
REHEARSALS HAVE
ALREADY STARTED
Program Cut To Two Nights
With May 23-24 As Dates
Provisionally
The most elaborate operatio pro
ductlon yet essayed will be attempted
Oxt May by the Mt. Vernon Festival
association when Goethe's Faust,
-with the wonderful music of Gounod,
will be rendered in full, with the ex
ception of a few minor cuts.
Directors of the festival associa
tion, meeting Wednesday evening at
the office of the president, Judge
Frank O. Levering, determined that
the festival should be shortened to a
two-night program.
The first evening will be devoted 'to
a miscellaneous concert. One artist,
whether a male or a female stager
has not yet been determined, wJH sap
pear ok this occasion. A varied pro
gram will be given by the chorus,
embracing numbers calculated ito
please all tastes.
And then comes "Faust" with
seven artists!
The directors decided, in shorten
ing the program, to concentrate on
the one night and it was determined
to employ a full cast of skilled vocal
ists. Bvery single solo in the entire op
era of "Faust" will be rendered that
evening.
All past efforts in securing famous
singers will be outdone this year, is
the promise held forth. A committee
was appointed at the meeting Wed
nesday night to communicate with
singers and secure a list of those
whose services might be available for
the festival.
One tiling was emphasized. Music
lovers of the city are to be given an
opportunity to hear greater singers
than ever before. Although unsuc
cessful financially last year, the as
sociation was backed so loyally by
private subscription that there will
be no stinting this year.
The provisional dates for the fes
tival were set at May 23 and 24. This
io several weeks later than the time
of the 1916 festival. The setting of
these dates as permanent depends en
tirely upon the time when artists may
be secured.
Rehearsals have already started on
tie opera. William M. Coup.-wbosc
splendid work in the past has been
the deciding factor In the success,
from a musical standpoint, of ,the fes
tivals, is again in charge.

FOR
LOCAL BALLOT!
WILL BE SAVED
Board Of Elections Follows
Instructions
STEP IS QUESTIONED
Legality Of Obeying Orders Of Sec
retary Of State Matter of Com
ment No Evidence Of Any
Irregularities In Knox
County
The ballots cast in Knox connty at
the last election whicb, according to
law aro to be burned Friday, will be
preserved, according to Samuel H.
Peterman, chief deputy of the board
of elections.
The receipt of a telegram here
from Secretary of State Hildebrant,
mention of which is made in the news
service of The Banner today, caused
this decision.
This telegram suggests that irreg
ularities have been reported in the
last election in certain sections of the
state and advises that the ballots be
preserved. '
Clerk Allen Johnson stated Thurs
day that the secretory of state is the
recognized head of the election ma
chinery of the state and that his or
ders will bo obeyed.
Several attorneys of the city ques
tion the action of the local board of
elections in saving the ballots. They
point out that the time limit for
charging errors or demanding a re
count expires today and that nothing
of this nature has been done;
The law specifically provides that
the ballots, in event Of no contest,
shall be burned after the expiration
of 30 days. The law does not au
thorize, attorneys argue, the secre
tary of state to retard its processes
without taking the customary steps.
Frank J. Meade, a member of the
"local board of elections, was inter
Viewed Thursday. He stated that he
had not seen the telegram. When
told of Its contents, he said that he
did not know just what the local
board would do. "It has been the
custom in the pasti" he said, "to burn
the ballots aftCT SO days."
In view of the fact that there has
never been the slightest question of
the least irregularity in the last elec
tion, as far as Knox county is con
cerned, future developments will be
watched with interest.
QUESTION OF WHERE FISH WERE
CAUGHT RAISED IN ARREST
MADE NEAR NEWARK.
Newark, Dec. 7 Despite the fact
that the -whole lower end of Buckeye
Lake is ruined for fishing, John
Fickel has again been arrested.
Briefly, the history of the arrest is
that, in the court of Justice D. M.
Jones, a game warden, Joseph S:
Sackett, appeared and filed an affi
davit. The game warden in question
is a new one in this locality and is'7i
years of age, though he does -not look
the part. His Borne is in southern
Fairfield county, although a good part
of his life has been spent In Cincin
nati. He charged John with selling a
mess of "blue gills," and Fickel plead
ed not guilty and furnished a $100 ap
pearance bond. The case Is set for
hearing on Thursday, Dec. 14.
Living, as Fickel does, well south
on the lake, it will be interesting to
know where he caught the tlsh.

ASHBROOK WILL
FIGHT OMNIBUS
Expects Embarrassment On
Account Mt. Vernon Item
BTAND IS MAINTAINED
Says Pork-Barrel Raid Doesn't Look
Any Better To Him Now Than
It Did Before The Last
Election
Washington, D. C, Dec 7 The
house committee on public buildings
and grounds met yesterday with the
pork barrelers in control, and adopt
ed a motion directing the chairman
of the committee to press every ad
vantage to the utmost in an effort to
put through the house the omnibus
building bill now on the calendar.
Representative Ashbrook, a mem
ber of the committee, refused to Join
in the proposed raid and gave notice
that he will fight the bill.
"A pork-barrel raid doesn't look
any better after election than it did
before," declared Ashbrook. "It will
cause me some embarrassment to op
pose the bill, as it contains an appro
priation for Mt. Vernon, in my dis
trict, but that will not stop me. I
shall fight it with -all my power.
At the very outset of the session
the pork barrelers are extremely
busy. The house today passed its
first pork measure of the session, an
omnibus fisheries bill, after being
warned by Representative Cox of In
diana that pork doesn't smell any
better in a pofk barrel.
LAIR' S CHOICE
Football Captain-Elect Ster
ling .Athlete
IS BASKETEER HEAD
Double Responsibility Wil Be Easily
'Carried By (One Who Has Been
Bulwark Of Strength For
i Several Years
Notwithstanding the fact that How
ard Blair was elected captain of tho
Mt. Vernon high school basketball
team at the election last 'March, bo
has 'been elected captain of the Mt.
Vernon high school's football team
for 1917 through bis meritorious
playing cm the iteam of 1916, under
the careful captainship of Captain
Hadley. x
Blair exhibited his skill on tho gym
floor last winter when he showed
himself to bo instrumental In giving
the local high school basketball team
such a high standing in the tourna
ment held at the Edwards gymnas
ium, Delaware, last year. As a re
sult of his excellent playing, he was
elected captain of the basketball team
of 1917.
During tho football season, which
ended Thanksgiving Day, when the
local high school defeated Delaware
by a score of 14 to 7, Blair was again
instrumental in gaining the laurels
for Mt, Vernon high. In lact, througli
the plays of Faddls, Hadley and Blair
of (he football team, Mt. V-ernon high
gained such a great reputation that
the Delaware paper stated it as be
ing "one of the strongest teams in the
state of Ohio." Both Hadley and
Faddls graduating this year, Blair
was the logical choice to lead the
high school boys to another such high
place in the esteem of other Ohio
teams.
During his entire career in the
athletic field, Blair has shown him
self to be the man to bo elected to
the enviable position of captain of
the Mt. Vernon high school football
team of 1917 and all of those who
have upheld tho high school during
its athletic frays wish Captain-elect
Blair all the success that should be
coming to one who is so able to as
sume the responsibility that must
necessarily be placed upon the shoul.

CABINET CHANGE MADE
HILDEBRANT ORDERS
Sends Telegram to the County
Boards of Election.
Columbus, Dec 6. Secretary of
Mate Hlldobrant has advised connty
boards of elections not to obey the
mandate ot the law In destroying bal
lots at the end of thirty days, but to
preserve them until "farther advice."
The telegram of the secretary of
state to connty boards follows:
"Charges have been made to me of
mistakes, errors and irregularities In
counting and canvassing the vote of
the election of Nov. 7. It is advisable
that the ballots be not destroyed. Ton
will therefore see to it that ballots are
preserved until further advice from
me."
Democratic attorneys say only
courts aro empowered to order bal
lots preserved.
Forest F. Tipton, secretary to Gov
ernor Willis, said that Hildebrant'e
action apparently was the only meth
od available to preserve the ballots.
Re said that contests on the election
of state officials can not be filed until
after the general assembly, the first
week in January, has canvassed the
vote. That would be too late, he ex
plained, to order the ballots preserved.
Republican State Chairman Hatfield
said it had not been determined
whether the Republicans will ask for
a recount, but that affidavits as to im
proper counting are being obtained in
a number of counties.

LLOYD-GEORGE
NEW
PREMIER
Called By King George To
Handle Crisis
Undertakes the Task of Forming
British Ministry.
BONAR LAW DECLINES THE JOB
New Government Will Be Coalition,
Because Neither of the Great Par
ties Has a Majority In the Houso
of Commons Outcome of a Day of
Conferences Held at Buckingham
Palace.
London, Doc. 7. It is announced
officially that David Lloyd-George baa
ilEEolved the Asquith cabinet and will
l-ecome premier himself.
The new government will be a coali
tion, like the old one, but probably
without the same measure of harmoni
ous support which attended the forma
tion of the first coalition government,
because its birth has created addi
tional factional differences.
The king called the party leaders
to Buckingham palace and conferred
with them for more than an hour. Mr.
Asquith and Mr. Lloyd-George of the
Liberals, Mr. Bonar Law and Mr. Bal
four of the Unionists and Mr. Hender
son of the Labor party were with the
sovereign.
Whatever passed in council is held
secret, but the infeience that the kin;
tried to arrange a reconciliation ap
pears a most natural one. The five
statesmen departed separately, four in
their motor cars and the working
men's spokesman afoot. Afterwards
the king gave an audience to Mr. Bo
nar Law, who declined to undertake
tbe formation of a new ministry, and
then to Mr. Lloyd-George, who accept
ed the responsibility, as everyone ex
pected he would if the opportunity
came to him.
The official announcement that Mr.
Lloyd-George had undertaken the
task, with the co-operation of Mr.
Bonar Law, was a notification that the
new government would be coalition.
Any party government would be im
possible, because neither the Union
ists nor tbe Liberals have a majority
in the house of, commons; either one
must attach the Irish Nationalists or
the Laboritee to Itself to command a
majority. The Nationalists have re
fused to participate In the government
until home rule becomes established.
The Laborltes are sworn enemies to
Mr. Lloyd-George because they resent
fols accusations that the working men
have put their personal interests
above the national Interests at times
during the war.
FRENCH GUNBOAT SUNK
Attacked and Torpedoed by German
Submarines.
London, Dec. 7. The French gun
boat Surprise has been sunk by Ger
man submarines at Funchal, Madeira,
according to an announcement by the
Portuguese minister ot marine in a
wireless dispatch received here from
Lisbon. Thirty-four of the crew of the
pinboat perished. A few Portuguese
were alBO killed aboard the steamers
Kanguroo and Dacia, which were tor
pedoed, according to the dispatch.
A dispatch to tbe Exchange Tele
graph from Lisbon says: "News re
ceived from Madeira 'says that thirty-
four persons were killed in tbe bom
bardment of Funchal. The submarines
shelled the shore for two hours, espe
cially the English cable' station and
other ptfblic buildings, but only small
damage was done. The steamers Kan
guroo and Dncia were torpedoed."

WOODLOT8 NEED ATTENTtONI '
Farm woodlots are becoming moro
valuable, and as timber continues to
command higher prices farmers will bo
well paid if they care for their wood
lots In such a way that high-grade-products
may be marketed, writes J,
W. Calland in Bu lletin 302 of tho Ohio.
Experiment Station. Much of the tim
ber of commerco is now being pro
duced in farm woodlots, and tho
amount is steadily increasing, forest
ers say, as the principles of forestry
aro being applied. In Ohio alone moro
than 4,500,000 acres is in woodland. In,
many cases the state foresters have
made personal visits to advise farmera
regarding the planting manacement
and marketing of timber.
CORN LACKS LIME
Because of Its low content of min
eral matter, particularly lime, corn
should not be fed as the sole concesr.
trate in rations for swine. Bodily
weaknesses result from a deficiency of?
mineral elements when other feeds aro
not supplied with corn.
In experimental feeding tests con
ducted by Dr. '. B. Forbes of the Ohio
Experiment Station, hogs fed mainly
corn had weak bones often resulting in.
lameness and fractures. Such injur
ies do not occur with hogs on pasturo
or with those given feeds rich in lime
such as clover, alfalfa, rape, sklmmilk;
and tankage. Bone flour, wood ashes,,
corncob charcoal and lime are useful
supplements to rations deficient in min
erals. HOW TO CONTROL SCALE INSECTS
Spraying fruit trees with lime-sulphur
wash and with soluble oils con
troll a San Jobe scale wEen properlv
applied, while poAdeied sulphur com
pounds gave promising results in ex
perimental tests conducted by entom
ologists ot the Ohio "Experiment Sta
tion. Cure alls were unsuccessful.
Little difference in effectiveness was,
listed, between home-boiled lime-sulphur
and tbe commercial form mired:
with seven parts of water and applied
in early spring. Soluble oils, mixed
with 15 parts of water, are also recom
mended. Powder sprays, as soluble sulphur
couipound, barium sulphur and Modoc
soluble sulphur, gave variable results,
in killing tbe scale insects. The Star
tion experts do not discriminate
against such materials but say they
should be used only in an experimental
way.
Treevax and Derror's tree fluid, said"
by manufacturers to cure all ailme'nts,
of trees, had no effect in controlling
either insects or plant diseases .-

SENDING APPLES BY S 'J
PARCEL POST
After three year's trials in sending
apples in corrugated strawboard car
tons by parcel post, the Department ot
Horticulture of the Ohio Experiment
Station has found that the fruit will
carry to almost any distance with little
or no injury. The use of parcel post,.
.however, is not advised for shipments
beyond the second zone because tho
postage is much greater than the ex:
press rate.
Half peck and peck boxes were sent
to several different states, including
Colorado, Texas and Florida. One box
was sent to British Guiana. In prac
tically all cases the apples reached
their destination v.-ith no or only slight
bruises. The one-piece slotted pack
age was found the most satisfactory
type for shipments.
Sinking of the Lambert.
Washington, Dec. 7. The sinking
of the John Lambert by a. submarine
off the Isle of Wight, Nov. 22, was re
ported to the state department by the
American embassy in Paris, but as tho
vessel was described as c, French mer
chantman, en route from Montreal for
Havre, no effort has been made to se
cure further details. Records of tha
department of commerce show that
the Lambert sailed from Canada un
der French papers. An inquiry may
be made to establish her exact status.
It is said the Lambert was listed s
