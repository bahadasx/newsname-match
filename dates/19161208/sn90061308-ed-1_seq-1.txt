LLOYD GEORGE WILL ftECOMB '
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
Former War
Secretary Overthrows
Ci Devant Prime Minister-
Un-
dertakes King's Offer to Form
Coalition Cabinet.
London, Dec. 6. David Lloyd
George has overthrown the Asquith
cabinet and will become prime minis-
ter himself. The new government will
be coalition, like the old one, but prob
ably without the same measure of har-
mony which attended the formation of men's meeting next Sunday afternoon,
the first coalition cabinet, because its . This will be his first appearance bs
birth has created additional factional I fore th men and a good attendance
-.differences. .
This result has emerged from
another day of active and hurried par.
liamentary conferences, and a day of
intense suspense and interest through
out the country.
There was a prospect this afternoon
that personal offices of the king might
solve the situation, and many thought
that the Asquith regime might be
continued. The king called the par
liamentary leaders of Buckingham
place and conferred with them for
more than an hour. Mr. Asquith and
Mr. Lloyd-George of the liberals, Mr.
Bonar Law and Mr. Balfour of the
unionists and Mr. Henderson of the
labor party were with the sovereign.
It is many years since a British
ruler assembled the representatives of
the different factions face to face
when they had shown themselves ui.
able to settle their differences. But
no such serious crisis has arisen be
fore to require such action by the
king. ,
Whatever passed in council is held
in secret but the inference that the
king tried to arrange a reconciliation
appears a most natural one. The five
statesmen departed separately, four in
their motor cars and the working
men's spokesman afoot. --

FARM HOME BURNS
The home of George Storck on
Stones Prairie six miles south of Mo
nett was totally destroyed by fire
Tuesday night. ' '
A member of the household awoke
about 1 o'clock to find the house
ablaze. . The family was awakened
and escaped barely, in time to save
their lives. It is believed that the
blaze started in the wash house where
there had been a fire during the day.
The loss was partly covered with
insurance but some new furniture and
a new Victrola were a total loss. The
building was owned by Jacob Storck,
father of George Storck.

NO LECTURE LAST NIGHT
Fulton S. White,"agricultural direc
tor, of the Frisco, failed to hold a
meeting n & city last night for the
reason th'JEi he overlooked tho need of
a .meeting place and did not make ar
rangements for a hall.
Farmers came from a distance to
hear the talk but were disappointed
It seems strange that a man who has
been before the public as many years
as Mr. White has would overlook so
important a matter as a meeting
place. " . '

temptation to condemn the majority
of the voters of the United States for

BUCHAREST TAKEN BY
TEUTON FORCES
Capital City Is Taken Exactly 100
Days After Declaration of War
Now Occupying 50,0CP !.
Square Miles.
Berlin, Dec. 7. Bucharest, the cap
ital of Rumania, is in the hands jof
the forces of the central powers.
Exactly 100 days after the declara
tion of war by Ruinania finds the Teu
tonic allies in control of about 50,000
square miles of Rumanian territory,
virtually one-half of the kingdom,
running from the Transylvania Alps
northwest of the capital, to the Da
nube south of it an da large part of
Dibrudja and probably still on the
heels of the retreating Russian and
Rumanian armies which have been en
deavoring to hold them back.
Simultaneously with the announce
ment of -the fall of Bucharest came
the news of the capture of the impor
tant railroad junction of Ploetchi,
north of the captial, the' conquest of
which places in the hands of the in
vaders the last railroad in the west
and gives to them the head of the line
running northwest to Jassy, where
the capital of Rumania now is situ
ated. No details have yet come through
concerning the climax to the great
drive of the great armies of General
Von Falkenhayn and Field Marshal
Von Mackensen or whether the Ru
manians and Russianes succeeded en
tirely in making their escape behind
the Bucharest line. Previous to the
announcement of the capture of Buc
harest and of Ploetchi unofficial ad-
420 Broadway
Monett, Missouri
vices indicated that four divisions of
the defenders were in a hazardous po
sition in the region due west of Buc
harest and in danger of being en
veloped. With the fall of Bucharest the Cen
tral powers are now in possession of
four capitals of entente allied states,
the others being Brussels, Belgrade
and Cettinje.
