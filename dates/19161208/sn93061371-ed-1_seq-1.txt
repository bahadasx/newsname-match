NO HERD LAW
IN STATE OF
NEW MEXICO
Ruling of Judge AlcCiuFe
of Importance to Stock
men and Farmers
(Poi toles Valley News)
0!d supet-Etitions have been
knocked in the head by a rGCent
decision from the district court
of this county. Case number
518, is a case of4the state against
Cullen M. Johnson and others
find was argued on Friday of
tho week. Here you have the
two combinations, thirteen and
Friday, yet the Court held for
the defendant. The complaint;
was drawn under cection 49 of
the code of 1015, which provides
that it thall be unlawful for
any owner of cattle, horses, etc ,
to permit the same to run at
large during the months of
March, April, May, June, July,
August. September and October
ulilts they arB under the clis
tody of a keeper, or herder As
sistant District A)torney Hock
enhuil appeared for the state
and James A. Hall for the de
fense. The defense entered a
demurrer to the inuictment
claiming that section 49 had
Oeeu repealed. The demurrer
was argueTaTid the court took
the case under advLseni-jnt.
Monday of thU week Mr. Uall
received a copy of the dpinian
which holds that section had
beeri appealed. This opinion
does away with the' contention
l hut there is at this time a herd
law in New Mexico. Without
going into the merits of wheth
er or not a herd law is a neces
sity, it is some satisfaction to
have an authoritative ruling on
the present status of the matter.
Parties having growing crops
must provide a legal fence
against live stock or suffer the
damage done.
