Is Joint araaton today, u brlif and
to the point. Tbe prrsldfut aulil:
GrDtlrrorO of the Congrraa:
la fulDIIInc at tlila time the duly luid
opon nía by the Constitution f rom
munlcating to you from tlmv to llino
Inforuiulioa of the tnte of the L'ulon
and rccoinmemllng to your inuslili'ra
Uon luch Ipgixlullve tiieuMiri'x un may
be Judged neccxxury and I'xunllviit
hall continue the practico, whlrb 1
hopa baa been acceptublo to you, of
leaving to the reporta of the several
beads of the executive department the
elaboration of the detailed need of
the public aervlce and confine myself
to those mattera of more general pub
lic policy with which It seems neces
lary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent teuton of the congress.
I realise the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
thla seaaloo and ahall make my sug
gestiona as few as posxthle; but there
were soma things left undone at the
laat session which there will now be
time to completo aud which It seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
ta do at once.
In the flrst place. It seems to me Im
peratlvely necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded tho remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
ston to recommend to you at the close
of your last session In view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the ruilromls of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended :
First, Immediate provision for the
enlargement and ndtiilnlsiriillve rcor
gunization of the Interstate common
commission along the line cmhoillr
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now uwuitlng
action by the senate; In order that tin
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great und various duties
now devolving upon It with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which lire, wit
Its present constitution ami mentis of
uctlon, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal liusls alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who ure
actually engaged In the work of oper
ating trains In Interstate transporta
tion. Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults In experience of the adoption of
1 the eight-hour duy In railway trans
portation alike for the men aud for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the fucts dis
closed Justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
. of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, In case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should full, a full public
Investigation of the merits of every
auch dispute shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
hands of the executive of the power,
In case of military necessity, to tuke
control of such portions and such roll'
Ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft Into
the military service of the United
States auch train crews and admlnls
tratlve officials as the circumstances
require for their aafe and efficient use.
Renews Hla Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress Immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service and It nil
thorlzed the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immeuinteiy needed ;
but It postponed action upon the other
sufgeetlon until aa opportunity should
ba offered for a mora deliberate coa-
si dentina of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem It necta
ry to renew. Tbe power of tbe In
terstate Commerce commission to grant
aa Increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to Is Indisputably clear and a
recummendatlim by tbe congrí aa with
regard to such a matter mlgat asan ta
draw In question the acopa of the rom
mlnalon'a authurlty or Its larilaatVoa ta
do Justice when there la an raaaaa to
doubt either.
The other suggestion the Increase
the Interstate commerce controla-
slon's membership and la Ita facilities
for performing Its manifold duties, the
revision for full public Intwstlgatlun
and assessment of Industrial dlaputaa,
and the grant to Ue executive at the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary In time of war
or other like publtr necessity I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
Intrusted us with tbe responsibility
and duty of aenlng and safeguarding
them in such mutters would rtnrt It
hard. I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement at action
Opon them.
Not only does the Interstate com'
merca commission now find It practl
rally Impossible, with Ita present mem
bershlp and organisation, to perform
Its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but It la not unlikely that it
may presently be found advisable to
add to Ita dutlea atlll others equally
heavy and exacting. It must Brat be
perfected as an administrativa lustro
ment
Tbe country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tlon and conciliation which the con
gress ran easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to tnuke linmedlute and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nutlon wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues Its own rase in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one
of Its Items, the Increase in the effi
ciency of tbe Interstate commerce com
mission, the bouse of representatives
has alrcudy acted; Its action needs
only the concurrence of the scnute.
: ? 0?rr'.'i!..-
I would hesitate to recommend, ami
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the sugestión should I
make It. that any limn in any occupa
tion should be obliged hy law to con
tinue In an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass n law which
forbade or prevented the Individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society in do
ing so would be to adopt u new prin
ciple Into our jurisprudence which I
take It for granted we are not prepared
to Introduce. Hut the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be Mopped or Inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until u public
Investigation shall have been instituted
which shall make the whole question
at Issue plain for the Judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to promise
uny such principle. It Is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not he permitted to stop the In
dustrial processes of the nutlon, ut any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of the cuse us between em
ployee and employer, time to form Its
opinion upon an Impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing In that proposition
but the Justifiable sufegunrding by so
clety of the necessary processes of
Its very life. There Is nothing arbi
trary or unjust In It unless It be arbi
trarily aud unjustly done. It ran nnd
should be done with a full und scrupu
lous regard for the Interests und liber
ties of all concerned as well us for the
permanent Interests of society Itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three mutters of ; jiititl Importance
nwnlt the action of the senate which
have ul ready been n. inl upon hy the
house of represeiiialhts: tin bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
ngulnst monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Itlco;
and the hill proposing u more thor
ough und systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money In elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency ties In tin If est circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. Kven delay would seriously
jeopard the Interests of the country
and of the government.
linmedlute passage of the bill to reg
ulate tbe expenditure of money In elec
tions assy ama to ba lesa atetase ry
thsa tbe Immediate eaartment of the
other Bieanuree to which I refer; be-
caaae at least two years will elapse
before another election In which fed
Sat are (n Ih tilled ; but It would
grsaOy relieve the public mind If this
Important matter ere dealt mlth
While the t-irrotustaiK-r and the dan
gers to the public morals of thi ;n
eat method of obtaining ami sM'udlug
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent ot.M-natlou and tbe r-etlusls of
expenditure can be frankly studied lu
tbe light of present experience; and a
delay would have the further very Se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election as at band
and some ftpeiiul object connected with
It might be thought to he lu the mind
of those who urged It. Action can be
taken now with facts for guldunce and
without suspicion of partisan purine.
I shull not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand In the
matter of combined and concerted f
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently, will Immediately ussume,
bss Indit-d already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented In our experience.
We have not the necessury Instrumen
talities for its prosecution; It Is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be creuted uisin an adequate
acule under our present laws. Wa
should clenr away all legal obstacles
and create a busia of undoubted law
for It which will give freedom without
permitting unregulnted license. The
thing must be done now, because the
opportunity is here and may escape us
If we hesitate or delay.
Parte Rice's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the orguulc luw of I'or
to Rico la brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
Its people are not Just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended prlvl
lege which we huve not satisfied.
There Is uneasiness among the people
of the Wand und even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
tho pending meusure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do In any essentiul particular. We
ought to do It nt once.
There nre other matters already ud
vuneed to the stage of conference be
tween the two bouses of which It Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
und action taken upon them.
ImiMiitich us this Is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth conuress, 1
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure und satis
faction I have co-operated with you In
the many measures of constructive pol
Icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of (he country. It
has been a privilege to labor In such
company. I take the liberty of con
grutiilating you upon the couiplcllou of
a record of rare sei viceahleuess and
distinction.

The Years After Fifty.
When men pass the half-century
mark, they usually regard themselves
as going down hill.
A discovery which I made by talking
with those who were really living In
the hitter period, was that many of
them regarded their experience of life
In the advancing years as the best part
of the whole. It did not appear on
the surface ; It waa not any marked
success before tho world, and It was
not appeal, perhaps, to those in the
earlier life; bat many of those people
told me they felt that they were liv
ing the happiest days of all. There
seems to be a mysterious quality of
life lu these later years which. is not
found In the earlier part, soutetliliii
that Is worth while In the living of it ;
and no one bus hud ull of human life
until he bus been through these years
and found It.
Then, and not before, I came buclt
to the conviction that one who has at
tained a half-century of clean, honest
living. Is worthy of congratulation;
that he ought to pass bis fiftieth birth-
