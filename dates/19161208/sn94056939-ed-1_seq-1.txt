ed by tho Inline in jack rabbits
and cotton tails. Commissioner
of agriculture Fred W. Davis
says thoy aro quoted at a higher
prico than turkey or chicken in
some cities.
Already the department has
received orders for two carloads.
Texas rabbits generally have
been considered nuisances. As

per head is paid for their des
t"i tion. Tho nirrh-ultural de
partment thinks it will hnvo no
trouble in getting largo ship
ments to the East, but to givo
