of Guam, Capt William R. Shoemaker,
U7 S: N whom the latest navy direc
tory lists as "en route temporary duty
naval station, jpuam," is a through
passenser on the U. S. army transport
Thomas today. :
Capt Shoemaker passed- through
Honolulu September 13 on the trans
port Sheridan, bound ior jGuam to
make his investigation of the affair
for the navy department - He had no
statement , to make at that time ex
cept that he would look into every
anprle of the affair. ' V ; v
What caused the investigation was
the removal from office of Governor
Maxwell as governor of Guam by
Lleut-Comdr. William P. Cronan, com
manding the U. S. S.; Supply, station
ship; at Guam.: The' lieutenant-commander
-is Bail to have placed Gov
ernor Maxwell under arrest, put him
in the naval station hospital and later
had him sent, to Washington on the
transport "Sheridan for observation as
to his mental condition.
Cronan's action precipitated a terri
fic rumpus in the navy department
which was increased still more by the
arrival at Washington of Governor
Maxwell, who claimed the whole affair
to have been a conspiracy to discredit
him. , ' .
Officers of the Sheridan, when she
was in port laat said they believed
Governor Maxwell was perfectly nor-,
mal and In full control of all his facul
ties. They scouted any theories that
his mental condition was deficient and
said he had acted as any normal per
son would while a passenger on the
transport .
Capt Shoemaker called on Capt
George. R. Clark, commandant of the
naval station at Pearl Harbor, yester
day. ; .-V' - . ,
Silent on Resu'ta of Mission
Capt Shoemaker firmly but cour
teously declined to disclose, to the
press at least the nature of the re
port which he will make to the navy
department .
Shdemaker does state, however,
that conditions In Guam" are excellent
at the present time and that the gov
ernorship of tha present incumbent
Capt Roy Smlih, is apparently very
desirable. Smith was officially placed
In charge when Maxwell was relieved.
In Honolulu the captain got in' some
good work by fulfilling the require

WASHINGTON, D. C Dec. 8.--Of-flclal
information received " here es
tablishes the status of' the British
steamer Marina, which was sunk off
the Irish coast by a German submar

therefore entitled to the immunities
which Germany has pledged herself to
give merchant vessels. . The Marina
was sunk with the loss of six Ameri
cans, crew members, and Berlin has
already stated that the submarine com
mander reports 'that' he sank the ves
sel mistaking it for another.
A new note sent by the United
States to Germany on the general sub
marine situation appears possible.
If it Is sent, it will be for the pui
pose of clearlns up the apparent dif

Germany's pledges, after the Sussex
