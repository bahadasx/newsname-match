1 iciiil-anitual Report of Societal,v J
Wm. Porter Proven l.usi Siv
Months to Have Been High- j
ly Successful Term
In point of actual accomplish
ments the six-months term of the
chamber of commerce ended Novem
ber first was the most successful In
the history of the organization, an
exceptionally large number of im
portant projects being brought to a i
satisfactory culmination. The semi- 1
annual report of the organization has: I
been prepared by Secretary William |
M. Porter, and is a source of not a j
little gratification to the members of j
the chamber. i
The membership of the chamber
now totals 14.'1, and the average at
tendance at the weekly meetings of
the organization during the six 1
months was 41. Interest in the work
of the commercial body is keener
than at any previous time. Three
thousand pices of mail matter were
sent out from the office of the sec
retary, 2600 pieces being advertising
matter and 400 letters.
The chamber reduced its Indebted
ness on the- elegant new quarters in
the city hall from $400 to $91.66, at
the same time contributing $60 to
ward the support of the Pullman '
citizens hand.
Probably one of the greatest ac
complishments of the chamber dur
ing the term, which resulted in a
vast amount of good, was the in
auguration in the county of the boys'
and girls' club work and the holding
of the club work fair. At a time
when all hope for securing the serv
ices of a club leader and financial as
sistance from the State College and j
state department of education
seemed remote, the local chamber I
guaranteed the sum of money neces
sary to be appropriated by the county
commissioners In order to secure the
state and college appropriations and j
the club leader was secured. Later
other commercial organizations came
to the relief of the Pullman chamber
by paying a part of this guarantee,
the county commissioners finding it
Impossible to make the appropria
tion.
The chamber was largely instru
mental in bringing to l'ullman and \
the State College the big excursion
of State farmers and bankers, which
resulted in a vast amount of valuable
advertising for the college and the
town.
Especially active during the term
was the road committee and the
value to the community of the good
work accomplished by that commit
tee can not tie overestimated. The
committee was responsible' for the
sanding of a considerable stretch of
road in the Clinton district, east of
Pullman, and raised the money neces- :
sary for the purchase of an acre of
the Savage property, two miles west
of Pullman, which made possible
the elimination of a steep incline and
sharp turn in the public highway.
The committee now has under con
sideration the securing of a better
trade leading to Pullman from the
west than the steep West Main street
hill, and all indications point to an
early realization of their hopes in I
this direction.
The student employment bureau
conducted during the summer In an)
effort to place college students in ,
harvest positions, resulted in the
Placing of a large number of students
ln good summer positions, the plan
Proving highly successful; both from
the standpoint of the students and ,
the farmers who employed them.
Another important step taken by
the chamber was the invitation ex-j
tended to the legislators of the state
t0 visit Pullman and the State Col
lego,so that they may become ac
quainted with the needs of the col-1
lege. The expense of the legislators j
while in Pullman will be borne by ,
the chamber.
The semi-annual report of the
treasurer shows total receipts during,
the term of $939. Of this amount j
■ "70.25 was expended for general
expense items,

WINTER SCHOOL AT STATE COLLEGE
_
Successful crop production is
fundamental to success in practically
all lines of general farming. Poor
crops mean high priced feed for your
live stock. Poor crops mean high
cost per ton, per hundred or per
bushel, A knowledge of the princi
ples underlying the developing and
maintaining of soil fertility, the prin
ciples of plant growth and the spe
cific requirements of various farm
crops is essential to successful crop
production. You say the passing
generation of fanners were aide to
succeed without special study. Very
true. iii many cases they paid little
or nothing for their land and the in
come that kept their families and
made them prosperous would scarce
ly pay rent or interest on valuations
today. They secured their land in its
virgin fertility. More expense ami
more Intelligent management Is
necessary to secure equally good i
Crops today. Insect pests and fun- 1
ous diseases are more troublesome. J
More complex and exp«»»rlve equip-1
ment and more tV't,, ■■' ■ '!'<"' is 1

the sticker method, and proved that
th.' people of that ward have extreme
faith In the business ability of the

ure due to the inclement weather,

women supporters away from the
polls.
As soon as the counting of votes
in the various precincts . was well
under way it as evident that J, XV.
Mathews had defeated W, L. Greena

ful candidate' was given a majority
of the votes In all but the Second
ward, and in precinct 6-1 of the
Third ward, where 260 votes were
cast, his majority was overwhelming.
William Swain, after carrying both
the First and Second wards by sub
stantial majorities for councilman
; iet hit go, was a poor second In the
two College hill precincts, and W.

majority of 131 votes.

NUMBER 7
ELECTION OFFICIALS
PROTEST VIGOROUSLY
Resent Action of County Commis
sioners in Culling Down Their
Claims for Services
he election officials of precinct
j No. 94, who labored from :00
clock in the' morning of Tuesday,
j November 7, till 8:00 o'clock
| Wednesday evening, receiving and
I counting the 360 ballots cast at the
general election In that precinct,
j were highly indignant to learn that
| the county commissioners had cut
I down the claims for their services.
and have entered a vigorous protest
against such action. They were not
i the only ones dissatisfied with the ac
jtion of th» commissioners In trim
ming claims of election officials, and
many protests were filed with the
board at their meeting this week.
The commissioners have taken the
i matter under advisement and any
I that they want to treat everybody
j fairly.
in reference to (he matter Com
missioner Whitlow says:
"We were unable to reconcile Ihe
claims of some precinct officials who
j counted a hundred or so votes in
I three days' time with the claims of
larger precincts who counted twice
as many votes, yet only put in claims
for the same amount of time. There
was such a discrepancy in the total
I amount of claims in proportion to
the number of votes counted by each
set of officials that we were com
pelled tee strike an average and lease
I all claims from that standard.
"For 100 to 150 votes counted we
: allowed two days; for 200 to 260,
three days; from 250 to 360, three
and one-half days, or as nearly upon
this basis as possible, if we made
any mistakes in our computations up
on this basis we will, of course, rec
tify them. Our aim was not to cut
down, particularly, but to equalize
lin various claims as Pest we could."

PULLMAN MIA FURNISH
PROOF OF VERACITY
All question as to the veracity of
11,,. fish stories" eminatlng from
Oeorge Ritchey and Wilford Allen,
former Pullman men who are now
located at Grants Pass, Oregon,
where tie- Rogue river furnishes
abundant opportunities for the Izaak
Walton, was dispelled this week
when local friends of the pair re
ceived a box of mammoth steel-head
salmon, caught by hook and line.
The fish were beautiful specimens of
their kind, weighing as high as six
pounds dressed, and the Pullmanltes
who were fortunate enough to be re
membered by Messrs. Ritchey and Al
len will never again take their won
derful stories of struggles with the
mammoth steel-head beauties with a
grain of salt.
