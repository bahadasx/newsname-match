In a short addres to the members of
the various companies of the Hawaii
National Guard on Maui, last week,
Governor Pinkham made the formal
presentation to the regiment of the
two beautiful banners which were don

To me, as Governor and Commander
in Chief, has been assigned the honor
of presenting to you these standards

America, an dthe other the flag of the
Territory of Hawaii.
The latter indicates your position
and share in maintaining the physical
and political integrity of these islands
the former your obligation to that
Great Republic under the folds of
whose flag you are united with forty
nine sub-divisions and have sworn to
maintain free government "for the peo
ple, of the people and by the people."
Your avocations are peaceful, your
hopes and expectations are for peace,
but you know the only sure peace is
that which you can command.
In your wonderful patience, which
really is the test of men and patriot
ism, you have proven the metal of
which you are made, and it fixes your
promise for the future.
The National Guard, as organized,
depends on the high spirit of its
members and much on the support of
citizens; hence it is a pleasure to an
nounce the American flag is the gift
of The Schuman Carriage Company,
and the territorial Flag the gift of the
Arm of Wall and Dougherty, both of
Honolulu.

Maui Folk Hear
Discussion On Arts
D. Howard Hitchcock And Othes Talk
Entertainingly Arts And Crafts
Section Of Fair a Big Success
One of the most valuable' exhibits
of the Fair was the interesting collec
tlon at the Alexander House Settle
ment Gymnasium under the arts and
crafts department. The whole building
was filled with an exhibit that called
forth the highest praise from the
throng of visitors that crowded in dur
ing the three days of the Fair. By
special arrangement the exhibit was
kept open from two until five on Sun
day and all day Monday.
The finale was the Berles of three
lectures at half past three on Monday,
D. Howard Hitchcock talked for about
an hour in a fascinating way upon the
making of a painting and the worth of
the picture. He answered a large
number of questions that carried the
discussion further. He used his pic
tures to illustrate his conception of a
painting. A large number of Hign
School pupils were present and about
as many more persons interested in
art. John F. G. Stokes curator of the
British Museum followed with an in
teresting history of the Museum, and a
description of some of the implement
used by the Hawaiians and a brief
history of the development of them
He was listened to most attentively
by the audience. Paul Steel then clos
ed the afternoon of short talks by giv
ing an excellent outline of the Citizfv
ship propaganda now being carried La
by the Y. M. C. A. of Honolulu on Oahu
and Kauai and by the Maui Aid As
sociation on Maul. The Hawaiian
Board exhibit hung in another part of
the Gymnasium created a great deal
of interest among the visitors of the
Fair.
Never before were so many beautl
ful paintings and works of art col
lected on Maui. It was a delight to
the lover of the beautiful to spend as
much time as possible In that collec
tion. The committee in charge spared
no time or effort to make the affair
great success.
The complete list of prizes in this
department is published unaer another
column.
Big Fair Closes To
Tread OfMerry Feet
Closing Address By D. H. Case Voices
Well The Feeling Of Those Who
Worked For Maui To Such Good
With the Hawaiian band playing
Aloha Oe," "Hawaii Ponoi," and clos
ing wUh the "Star Spangled Banner,"
the First Annual Maui County Fair
was officially declared ended at shortly
fter eleven oclock last Saturday
ight. The closing address was made
by
D. II. Case, of the general com
mittee, on behalf of Chairman Wads
worth who at the time was doing the
honors as host in speeding the Gov
ernor on his homeward way. The
grounds were still thronged with merry-makers
who were dancing and in
other manner enjoying the last of a
most successful event.
Mr. Case, was accompanied to the
platform by Director Cameron and
other members of the general commit
tee, and he was listened to attentively
by the crowds still on the grounds.
Within twenty minutes after he had
finished speaking, the grounds were
deserted and tjbe big undertaking was
thing: of the past. Mr. Case spoke
as follows:
The First Maul County Fair is about
to close. We have had three stren
uous days and nights of both profit
and pleasure to all. In my opinion
formal address at this time would be
absolutely out of place. I am neither
prepared to give such'an address, nor
would you have the patience to listen
o it if I were. I shall therefore end
eavor to make my remarks brief.
It Is said that this Fair has been a
success, and the thought that must
come to all of us at thiB time is: Who
is responsible for this succesT We
have had a Chairman who -for months
has been untiring in his efforts and
has spared neither time nor money to
bring about success. We have had a
Secretary who has likewise given gen
erously of his time. We have had a
Manager who has worked incessantly
day and night, week in and week out
wich but one purpose in mind to win
success for Maui s first fair. All of
the committeemen, with perhaps the
exception of the speaker, have like
wise generously contributed their time
and energy toward making this a
profitable and pleasurable event. But
friends, no committee on earth could
ever have succeeded in this venture
had it not have been for the co-opera
tion given by- the citizens of Maul, and
the citizens throughout the territory.
On Thursday morning Mr. Crockett
addressed you on the spirit of Maui.
He spoke in general terms. With your
permission, I will, just for a few mo
ments, particularize on the community
spirit which has had so much to do

MauiTeachers Want
Share Of Prosperity
High Cost Of Living Hitting Pedago
gues Hard Will Ask Legislature
For Relief -
Maui's public school teachers will
probably petition the next legislature
to increase their salaries to make up,
in part at least, for the increased cost
of living.
The teachers believe they have a
very Btrong case. Their memorial
will show for the sake of comparison,
the cost or an oramary teaener s ra
tion and raiment some ten years ago,
five years since, and today. It will be
based on prices ascertained from mer
chants' books for the different peripds.
and is expected to-be incontrovert-
able. During all these years that the
cost of living has been going up by
leans and bounds, it will be shown that
the teachers' salaries have remamea
virtually stationary.
It is expected that the teachers or
all Hawaii will Jin forced with Maui
in this demand.
WANT POSTOFFICE REOPENED
A move is on foot to- have the post-
offlce at Pauwela reestablished. This
ouice was ciubi'h several iuuuuis uu
when the postmaster, Nelson Kaloa
was arrested for embezzling govern
ment funds. Since that time the mail
for the office has been diverted to Hal
ku. ' An effort is also being made to
have a free rural delivery route establ
lshed through the Kuiaha, Haiku and
Kaupakalua districts.
FUMIGATION BIN TO
REMAIN ON MAUI
The fumigation bin exhibited at the
Fair under the auspices of the Hawaii
Experiment Station, has been installed
at the Haiku Sub-Station for experi
mental and demonstration purposes.
Should the design, which was planned
by C. A. Sahr, assistant agronomist of
the experiment station, prove success
ful it is likely that the extension
division will Install fumigating bins
in both the Kula bean and corn section
and also on the Kahului wharf.
i
Fair May Show Net
Profit Of Over $2000
-
Although it is not known de
finitely Just what the closing of
the books of the Fair committee
will show, present Indications
are that a net profit of some
$2,000 will be found.
The gross receipts are in the
nelgborhood of $7,000, and ex
penses will probably not exceed
$5000. In view of the fact that
the executive committee were
only hopeful of breaking even,
the results from a financial, as
well as in other particulars, are
most gratifying.

On Howell's Bond
Supervisors Would Recover Amount
Awarded Rinehardt For Personal
Injuries Hot Fight Likely
By Instructions from the board of
supervisors, yesterday, County At
torney Bevins will forthwith institute
suit against the bond of Hugh Howell,
former county engineer, for the re
covery of the $1700 which the supreme
court has just awarded as damages to
Charles Reinhardt, of Hana, for per
sonal injuries. Reinhardt, it will be
remembered, sued the county follow
ing his falling into a washout on the
Hana road. He was awarded $2000 by
the second circuit court, and on ap
peal the supreme court approved the
verdict of the local court, but reduced
the amount by $300.
On the grounds that the accident
was due to Howell's negligence the
the supervisors are now proceeding
against him and' his bond. It Is ex
pected that the case will be vigorously
contested by the bonding company, on
ground that the ordinance creating
the county .engineer's office, and del.
egatrng full authority to him, was il
legal. Howell was bonded by the Unit
ed States Fidelity & Guarantee Com
pany represented in the Islands by

Here At Home opines Ideas In
Maui Address
Fancy frills along educational lines
for the youth of Hawaii finds no place
in the plans of Governor Pinkham for
the Territorial public school system.
In an address delivered by him last
week to the several thousand school
children gathered at the Maui County
Fair, the chief executive told some
thing of his ideas in this connection,
and was listened to respectfully, if not
entirely comprehendlngly by his young
audience. Manifestly, however, the
Governor was taking the opportunity
of making his position on the educa
tional question clear to the older heads
of the Territory. His address was as
follows:
It is a pleasure to be permitted to
address you briefly and say a few
words that may be of assistance in
the problems you must meet
I wish particularly to speak to those
who think their educational opportun
ities may be too limited as they be

You live in a most kindly climate,

May Ask Legislature
For Farm Loan Act
A meeting of the members of the
Haiku Homesteaders' Association has
been called for the next Saturday eve
ning, the principal business of which,
it is announced, will be the considera
tion of a proposed farm loan bill to be
presented to the next legislature for
passage. It has been found tnat tne
national measure, by which the gov
ernment may lend money to farmers
for permanent improvements, 1b not
applicable here In Hawaii, and it is
suggested that the territorial legisla
ture should enact a similar measure.
The national law makes it possible
for a group of twenty-five farmers to
borrow for its members at six percent
interest and on forty years time, in
terest and principle being paid in stat
ed rate throughout the period.
