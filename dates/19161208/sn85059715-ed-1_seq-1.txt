BERLIN. Dec. 8.?The German
govei*nrnent issued a statement Friday
in explanation and Justification
rif tVio tmn?fr->r of Belelan laborers to
Germany. It says the measure Is by
no means a hardship for the laborers,
but is a social necessity.
Owing chiefly to the British embargo
against Belgian oversea trade,
which before the war, supported a
large part of the industrial population,
large numbers of Belgian workers
are idle, the statement Bays, and
conditions are growing worse. Many
families, after spending all their savings,
have become objects of public
charity. This state of things is not
due, as asserted in Belgium, to Germany
requisition of raw materials, it
Is explained, for these requisitions occurred,
as a rule, only where factories
were unable to continue operations.
Of 1.200,000 employes engaged In
Belgian industries before the war,
505.000. including 158.000 women,
are now wholly without work, and
150,000, including 46,000 women, are
partly without work, making a total
of 66 5,000 persons dependent on public
aid. In addition to these there are
293,000 wives and 612.000 children)
of men without work, so that 1,560,000
persons, or one-fifth of the total
Belgian population, require assistance.

note to Germany on the general submarine
situation appears to be among
the possibilities which may come out

The day's development in the situ- |
ation were:
The United States asked Great I
Britain for information to determine |
the status of the Peninsular and Oriental
linor Arabia, which a German
submarine commander took for an
armed transport.
Official Information coming to the
state department established that the
British ship Marina, torpedoed with
a loss of six Americans, was in no
sense a transport, and was entitled to
the immunities of a peaceful merchantman.
In both cases Germany has expressed
a willingness to offer amends
If its pledges were broken. ^

MARIETTA, Dec. 8.?Unofficial returns
of the Beal law election on the
wet and dry proposition in Marietta
Thursday given out Thursday evening
showed that the wets had won In the
fight that has been waged for the last
three or four weeks by the small majority
of eighty-five.
The total vote polled In the election
was 3,439, the drys getting 1,677
and the wets 1,762, in the thirteen
precincts of the city. Of the thirteen
precincts the wets carried seven and
the drys six.
It is claimed by both sides that this
is the closest wet and dry election
of the number that have been held in
Marietta during last few years. Last
night the wets appeared to be satisfied
with the fact that they had been able
to carry the city by the small major- "
ity. There was no celebration of any
kind either on the streets or at the
headquarters which have been conducted
during the campaign by the
saloon people and their sympathizers.
While the dry element was disappointed
over the outcome of the eleotion,
they were also well pleased with ,
