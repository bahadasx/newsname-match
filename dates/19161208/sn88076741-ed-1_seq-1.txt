TME PROGRESS OF THE WAI(.
Along the lines in northern France
and in Italy there has been no change.
The Austro-German lines are moving
close toJBwchareBt the capital of Roum
ania, and are now within shelling dis
tance. The Roumanians have been
making a stoat resistance in their re
treat bat have been forced backwards
without respite. A counter operation
by the Russian to the north of Rouman
ia and intended to counteract the Aus
trian march to Bucharest, while making
minor successes, has not been sufficient
ly strong to divert the armies of Von
Mackensen and Falkenhayn from their
progress eastward. The fall of Buchar
est is expected at almost any time now.
In Serbia the Serbian army is still
moving northward and reconquering
their own land, bat without much heavy
lighting, though the fighting is more or
less continous there. The event of the
week baa been the resignation of Prem
ier Asquitb. The ministry of Great
Britain was composed of selection of re
presentatives of all the political parties
and wa9 so constituted for united effort
tor the purpose of carrying on the war.
But. natuarally, the political differences
found their way into cabinet over many
vexed questions such as liquor regula
tion, conscription, etc. as well as direct
war issues. Mr. Bonarlaw or Hon.
Lloyd George are likely to take the posi
tion of premier and the latter the most
likely Considering the leading relation
Great Britian occupies with other allies,
her relations with neutral nations and
the problems of the British peoples con
nection with the war, the premiership of
Great Britain atthis time is about the
biggest job in the world unless it be
that of the German emperor. Personal
ly this writer is not a candidate for eith
er position.
H. C. L."
Yes, this phrase has gotten BO common
that that the newspaper paragraphers
now simply write the initials. "High
Cost of Living" is the most common
talk of the day, whether it be in news*
papers, stores or at the breakfast table.
As we have noted in these columns,
there are some peculiar things connected
with these high pricee. One, notably is
that while each and every person is do
ing his best to increase the price of his
own product, he is at the same time
'kicking hard against the high prices of
the products of other people.
Just now, there are extensive move
ments in the eastern cities among
"housewives" to organize a boycott on
toodBtnffs, particularly eggs, butter and
flour. In some cities these movements
and organizations have had some slight
effects in lowering prices.
These expressions of public sentiment
have even reached political circles and
there is no doubt that a law will be in
troduced in Congress in the spring, with
the object of placing an embargo on
wheat and other foodstuffs. That is,
that the law will not permit the expor
tation of such articles on the ground
that we need all suob food for home'con
aomptlon.
There an many objections to this sort
of procedure, Boyoott may be a legiti
innte means of fighting undue specul
ation, where persons have bought up
large quantities of food and stored it
with the object of making such food
warce and then charging high prices.
An embargo however, is only excusable
when the country is actually in need of
the stuff, and is not legitimate simply to
reduce the prioe. That would be equiv
alent to passing a law fixing arbitrary
prices.
The great mistake of the present
forms of this agitation is that the fight
is made on food products only. Nobody
in these movements wants to reduce the
price of a day's work, nobody is trying

make salaries •any less, no one is boy
cotting the manufacturers -of shoes or
cloth, while the prices of the steel man
ufacturers are soaring on eagle wings.
In other words, everybody in the big
cities and manufacturing towns wants to
buy tfaeir(Jvictuals cheaply, but to pre
serve ttaejpresent aoale of wages and tbe
profits on their own goods.
Now, as a matter of fact, the fanner
2an buy no more manufactured goods to
day with hts two dollar wheat than be
could five or ten years ago with seventy
five oent wheat.
Years ago, when a -sailor boy on a rner
chant ship in the harbor of Calcutta, a
floating river merchant, who in sailor
parlance us called
.a ''bumboat man" was
rather short of Engksh words by which
to express the idea that be was ready to
buy, sell or exchange anything that the
sailors wanted. So as be sailed by'the
ship he would shout in a singsong
"Changes for cbangee blackdog for
white monkey."
Really, that is the rule of all trade.
It is.a-"black dog for a white monkey."
It isn't a question of the price oI wheat,
eggs or butter, but a question of the
comparative value of all comoditiea, one~
^ith another. Any effort that reduces
the price of one or more commodities
must necessarily affect the prices of all
other goods and products including
labor. Thus the "housewives** are try
ing to boycott bread, butter and eggs
they are also fighting for the reduction
of the salaries of their own husbands.
Of course an embargo would have aim
iliar effects. If wheat is placed -under
embargo, wheat will doubtless fall
in price? The. farmers will have
less money to buy manufactured goods,
and they won't buy, and if the farmers
don't buy then such goods will fall in
prioe. There is no getting away from
this rule, this commercial law, of supply
and demand.
Another phase of this embargo matter
is that it enters into the European war.
We do not care to add to this lengthy
editorial except just to call attention to
tfie fact that Germany would be pleased
to learn that we had concluded not to
export any of our wheat or other food
to Europe.
Logically, an embargo on wheat should
also include an embargo on steel and
other war munition. These latter are
just as high priced comparatively as is
wheat. If it is desirable to lower the
price of wheat by embargo. Why not
also lower the price of all metal products
in the same way. The Germans would
also favor an embargo on metal pro
ducts, and there are many in this coun
try.
When all things are cheap, then the
farmer is willing to sell his products
aheaply. He can afford to. But he has
the right to make his labor and capital
go as far in the markets as the capital
and labor of any other class of capitalists
or workers.
The boycott or embargo methods, if
enforced, will prove to have two edges.
THE FEDERAL FARM LOAN ACT
Loans are made to farmers only.
Land speculation is not to be encourag
ed by the Act.
These statments give the intent of the
law, but whether this intent can be car
ried out is, of course, unknown at the
present time. Persons who are owners
or about to become owners of farm land
may become borrowers. And farther, to
quote the words of the Act, "No loan
shall be made to any person who is not
at the time, or shortly to become engag
ed in the cultivation of the farm mort
gaged."
The borrowers must fill out a blank
stating the objects to
"which he means to
apply the loan. If he apply the money
to some other purpose, the Federal Land
Bank, holding the mortgage may declare
the mortgage due and payable forthwith.
To keep watch over the borrower's use
of funds, is one of the special duties pf
the secretary-treasurer of the local Na
tional Farm Loan Association. He shall
assure himself from time to time that
loans are applied to the purposes set
forth in the application blank. And he
shall forth-with report to the district
Land Bank any failure to oomply with
the terms of th« application.
A "DISTRICT JUDGE*'
SUPREMECOURT
Our grave and reverend supreme court
of this state is in rather an undignified
scramble for office this week, especially
notable as our wonderful primary law
tried to take the judiciary out of the
mud of every day politics.
The trouble lies in the fact that the
first judges by specific authority of the
constitution took office on December 4th
of that year. Since that time all sue*
cesaors have taken at the qpme time as
do alt other officials, which is the first
Monday of January. The newly elected
supreme judges claim that in their case
they should qualify on the fourth day
of December, while the present justic
es claim that they are entitled to serve
out their full terms which would end in
January.
A peculiarity of this case is that it is
a case that must be tried before the su
preme court itself, but as all the justic
es are concerned in the decision therefore
all of them are disqualified to sit on
4he case, and as a result the court for
the time being will be composed of dis
trict jndges.
It is quite possible that the decision
will have a hearing on the case of the
senatorahip in this 'First Legislative
District in which there is also a legal
tangle as to length of term of the senator.
But it is not probable that the latter
will ever become a matter of supreme
court decision oecause according to the
rules of all legislative bodies, such bodies
are the judges of the qualifications of
their own membership.
Still, if the senatorial matter should
come to the legislature, and the supfeme
court had already decided OQ certain vi
tal points, we wonder whether the senate
would pay any attention to the "prece
dents" of the supreme court, or decide
as they usually do, almost purely on a
party basis with little attention to the
actual merits of the contest.
But it looks as though the "district
judge" supreme court will have to de
cide whether the constitutional term of
four or six years goes, or whether it has
been changed.
NO NATIONAL GUARD
HEREAFTER
In along article published in Collier's
Weekly a returned militia officer scores
the government with veryjserious charg
es.
Some of his points are—that the mili
tia were deceived 'by the' government
and expected to remain on the border
but a few months at jnost. That their
places were taken by regulars j,for which
purpose the regular army was to be re
cruited to its full* strength at one. The
latter has not been done.
That the recruiting of the regular
army cannot be done at the present rate
of pay, about fifty cents a day. That
the guardsmen left positions and occupa
tions at which they were making good
wages averaging from four to seven dol
lars a day on which they supported their
families. Many of these families are
now actually suffering for #ant of means
of support.
That no resignations of officers or ap
plications for discharge are accepted by
the government based on "business mat
ters."
That a very large number of officers
tendered their resignations and that
many more would like to resign.
That the desire to return home is al
most unanimous among both officers and
men. That owing to their experiences
almost every man in this militia will
close his connection with that organiz
ation at the earliest. possible moment.
That only actual war conditions and per
sonal patriotism will ever induce them
to join the ranks again. Hence their
usefulness as a trained and organized
body as a reserve of the regulars in
"prepardness" will be lost. That their
experience will deter new recuiting to
the ranks of the national guard and
therefore there will hereafter be no
national guard.
The writer'sjremedy is to increase the
pay of the regular army and to make it
larger.
Personally except for an extraordinary
effervesence of personal patriotism
which few men posses, we hardly see
any inducement fer any man to join
either the national guard or the regular
army for fifty cents and board per day,
when a common farm hand in North
Dakota gets from thirty-five to forty
five dollars and board per month. Dig
ging dirt as a common laborer pays a
hundred per cent better than trench
digging i^ the army.
Guess Uncle Sam will also come in
under the H. C. L. as well as do
other employers.

WAS -THERE A TRADE?
The Minneapolis Tribune figures that
Wiibon got about three thousand of his
votes in Minnesota through a trade be
tween the Democrats and the Socialists.
There is no doubt that the Republican
national ticket was outrageously traded
in many quarters, but this is the first
suggestion that trading went on between
any party and the Socialists, who are
supposed to play alone hand at the polls
on election day. It has been asserted
that the Socialists, in States where the
blahket-ballot primary prevails, have
been made use of to swing the nomin
ations of one or the other of the old
parties. But there stern political moral
ity was thought to be immune against
any blandishments on the day of the
real election.
