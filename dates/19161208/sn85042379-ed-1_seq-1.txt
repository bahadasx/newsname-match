MINE CAVES IN
AND BURIES TWO
John Norstrum and Clarence
Day Badly Crushed When
Ledge Falls
NEIGHBORS DIG THEM OUT
Half Hour Spent in Finding Norstrum
Under Pile of Rock and Dirt.
Brought to Glasgow
John Norstrum and Clarence Day of
Osette miraculously escaped death
when they were buried under a slide
of coal and frozen dirt while digging
coal in a mine on the Reservation
Tuesday afternoon.
In company with three other neigh
bors, Jules Droze, Jimmy March and
Miles Irvin, Norstrum and Day had
driven over to the mine, about six
miles from the settlement at Osette,
to get a supply of lignite, which may
be mined from the surface.
According to the story as related
by C. H. Pritchard, who is in the city
today, Norstrum and Day were work
ing apart from the other three, and
had been undermining the dirt to get
at the best coal. Evidently they had
dug too far, without leavinjg neces
sary support for a big ledge of dirt,
and this tumbled and crashed down
upon them, before they had time to
get away.
Those who witnessed the accident
say that both of them started to run
when the dirt began to slide, but the
huge chunks of frozen ground and
coal caught them before they could
get out of the way.
Droze, March and Irvin immedi
ately went to the rescue and found
Day buried in dirt and coal up to his
hips. His legs were badly injured
and he suffered other injuries.
There was no sign of Norstrum un
der the slide, but one of the rescuers
found the end of a crowbar sticking
through the dirt, and they dug the
dirt away there and found him. He
had been buried under large chunks
of frozen dirt and in digging him out,
the men had to break these up into
smaller pieces before they could move
them. When they first found Nor
strum they thought he was dead, but
after working on him for five minutes
they discovered signs of .life. His
arm was badly crushed and his en
tire body severely bruised.
The wounded men were looked after
by Droze and March, while Irvin took
\ horse and rode over to Cool's ranch.
Fred Cool took his car and brought
Norstrum to Glasgow, and he is now
at the Deaconess hospital receiving
treatment. Day was taken to his
home and is receiving medical atten
tion there.
Reports from the hospital state
that Norstrum is getting along fine,
and it is not believed that it will be
necessary to amputate his arm.
PLAN BIG TIME
FOR NEW YEAR'S
Dance To Be Given at Gibson Opera
House to Raise Funds for Fire
Company
New Year's night, January first,
1917, will be the time and date of the
biggest and best dance ever given
in the city, if plans and promises of
the Glasgow Fire Department ma
terialize.
Arrangements have been made for
a big dance in the Gibson Opera
House, and a record crowd is ex
pected to attend. The proceeds will
all go into the department fund and
the fact that F. J. Gath is donating
the hall for the evening and other
contributions, should make it imper
ative that every one in Glasgow
either buy a ticket or attend the
dance, to help a good cause along.
The department is now completely
organized, and drilling has started.
Chief "Dug" Hall expects to have his
crew working like automatons within
a short time and only awaits the
chance to show the people what "His"
boys can do.
The department is now working in
conjunction with the city council to
get a fire alarm Bystem installed in
the city, so that the exact location
of the fire could be known when the
alarm is given.
WILL ANNOUNCE PRIZE WIN
NERS
The prize winners in the contest
held by the Glasgow flour mill, which
ended the first day of Docember, will
be announced in next week's issue of
the Courier, together with their an
swers to "Why 'White Cross' Flour
was the best." After considering the
answers the judges picked out the
best ones and the prizewinners will
be handsomely rewarded for their ef
forts.
AUTO TURNS OVER;
DRIVER KILLED
Del Cooper of Culbertson was
killed and his brother, William, suf
fered broken bones in both arms and
other injuries when their automobile
was wrecked near Sprole Sunday.
They were on their way to Poplar in
a Ford and were only about six miles
from their destination when the acci
dent happened.
Del Cooper was about 34 years of
age and had been in and near Cul
bertson for many years. He is a
brother in law of Pat Nacey, formerly
sheriff of this county and is well
known among the old timers of this
section.
"HELP A CHILD
FIND A HOME'
Montana Society Doing Great
Work in Helping Homeless
Children
"Help a child to find a home" is
the slogan of the Montana Children's
Home society.
The managers of this society, who
are the representative men and wom
en of the state, take the position that
every child has an inalienable right
to a good home and that which is the
most important part of a good home,
and true and honest love of devoted
parents.
Previous to the organization of this
home finding society, it was the com
mon custom of the state and some or
ganized societies to place homeless
and dependent children in some places
selected for that purpose where they
were kept and cared for in a bunch
and never knowing the beneficent and
lifting influence of a mother's love
and gentle care.
We have been a long time learn
ing some of the fundamental princi
ples of Christian love and charity.
The Great Master who taught "as
one having authority and not as the
Scribes and Pharisees" placed the
helpless innocent little child in a po
sition of first and greatest impor
tance.
There are as yet .very few people
who echo the words of those selfish
deciples, saying "Trouble not the Mas
ter or us with the children," but let
the state or some poor-house institu
tion care for them. It is certainly
very gratifying to know that there
are so many kind hearted and gener
ous people in Glasgow who are taking
an active interest in the welfare of
unfortunate children.
The children who have been placed
by this society in Valley county are
certainly a credit to the good judg
ment of its board of managers, for
such children have made good and
have brought joy and sunshine to the
hearts of their devoted foster parents.
Mr. A. L. Burton, who is the so
ciety's representative, is staying for
a few days at the Shannon hotel and
will be pleased to meet any who are
interested in either placing or adopt
ing children, or you can write the
Montana Children's Home Society of
Helena, Montana.

Judge Lindel Peter Evans died at;
the Deaconess hospital at 2:15 Tues- j
day morning after a brief but severe
illness. On Wednesday, November
29th, Judge Evans had a severe at
tack of stomach trouble, and upon
consulting Dr. M. D. Hoyt, he was
taken to the Deaconess hospital where
his case was diagnosed as appendi
citis.
Thursday morning, Thanksgiving,
he was operated on and it was found
that he had developed a very acute
case of appendicitis, that the appen
dix had burst and complications had
set in.
Everything was done at the hospi
tal to pull him through, but his case
was so far advanced, that despite the
brave fight to stave off the end, he
passed away early Tuesday morning.
His suffering had been intense the
last few days he had been alive and
death came as a relief. Hundreds of j
friends had daily anxiously awaited
news of his condition, and his death
has taken from the community a citi
zen who was everybody's friend.
The funeral was held Wednesday
afternoon from the Congregational
church, and although the weather was
stormy and cold, the church was
crowded with sorrowing friends,

BIG PRICES FOR
WOOL IN EAST
Dollar a Pound Paid for Finished
Product. Highest In
History
With copper selling for 30 cents a
pound, wool for a dollar a pound, and
wheat for $1.60 a bushel, Montana
producers of these necessary prod
ucts have no reason to complain.
Not only is wool selling on the Bos
ton market for $1 a pound now, but an
advance of 10 cents a pound is pre
dicted in the near future.
A report from Boston says there
will be a dearth of wool before the
new domestic clip can be put on the
market. Contracting in the west,
which had a good start, has stopped,
growers in Nevada having declined
to sell, even when the prices they
first asked were met.
Boston dealers are predicting a
clean cost of $1.10 a pound for good
staple territory. The bulk of the
trade has come to the conclusion that
the Australian markets are closed for
the season against American buying,
and that the announcement that bur
ry merinos could be shipped to this,
country after November 20 is of no
benefit. The small weight of wool
bought by Americans prior to that
date is not being allowed to be
shipped and few believe that any siz
able quantity of the staple will be
exported to the United States this
season.
Dealers in the Boston market are
loath to give out definite statements
about the volume of their business,
owing to the diminishing supplies and
fl'enishing stocks. Several houses
have moved large lines of territory
during the week. One has sold
800,000 pounds of various grades nt
private terms, and others smaller
amounts. Buyers have paid from .19
to cents for the best medium ter- (
ritory in the grease, which means a
s cou red value of about $1.05 for the
j^t^staple 96 to 98 cents for half
blood, 87 to 89 cents for three-eighths

»««»c prices are aoout

medium territory on a scoured basis,
but the scarcity of such wool makes

volume of territory in original bags is

cents to $1 a pound, clean, for the best !

Not to Exceed Two-Fifths of the
Appraised Value
School funds will be loaned under
the state farm loan act upon land
of an appraised value not less than
$10 an acre for a period of not less
than three nor more than ten years,
according to rules adopted by the
state board of Hand commissioners
which conform with the recent deci

These loans will be made in
amounts not exceeding two-fifths of
the appraised value. The minimum
has been set at |500 and the maxi
mum amount that can be loaned at
$5,000 by the board. The money will
be loaned at 6 per cent interest.
The initiative farm loan law pro
vided that only two-fifths of the as
sessed value could be borrowed.
The rules and regulations issued by
the board are as follows:
"Loans will be made only to actual
residents of Montana, and only upon
good improved farm lands of an ap
praised—not assessed—value of not
less than $10 an acre. No loans will
be made on more than two-fifths of
the appraised value of lands offered
as security therefor.
"Any person desiring a loan must
file with the register of state lands a
verified application, upon a form fur
nished by the state board of land
commissioners. Such application
must contain an agreement to pay
railroad fare and traveling expenses

security upon a form furnished by
the state board of land commission
ers, running to the state of Montana

"All loans shall bear interest at 6
per cent per annum, payable annually
to the register of state lands, who

loans, and account therefor to the
state treasurer.
