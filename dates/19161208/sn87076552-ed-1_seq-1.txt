PORTO U LETTER
The Smallest of Our Island Possessions and It's Princi
pal Product History of the Development and
Present Status of the Irrigation Service '
of Porto Rico
By Mrs. F. E. Kenyon.
For the facts and figures in this
letter I am indebted to a copy of "The
Jforto Rico Progress," San Juan; and
to an article prepared for the "Cor
nell Civil Engineer" by W. L. Squire
and F. H. Knapp.
Porto Rico, the smallest of our Is
land possessions, is ninety-five mile
long by thirty-hve miles wide, and is
the fourth in size in the West In
dies. The principal product of Porto Rico
is cane sugar, of which it is one of
the chief producers of the world. It
is for the benefit of this industry that
the Porto Rico Irrigation project has
been carried out.
The cultivation of cane is expen
sive .as compared with other crops'
It is a high type of intensive culture.
The Sugar Centrals employ many ex
perts and their management gener
ally is scientific. The planters appre
ciate the value of water to a crop of
cane, for frequent and prolonged
droughts that cut short or .ruined
completely the entire sugar crop
throughout the whole south side of
the Island kept the question constant
ly in mind.
The available cane land of the Island
is a - very small percentage of the
entire area and consists only of a
narrow coastal plain for the most
part in the south, east and west bor
ders. The area irrigated by the pro
' ject is located in the central southern
part; it is a strip of land about forty
milCs long by two miles wide.
Long periods of drouth are common
as many as six months have passed
without rain. The dry season ex
tends from June to September. In
general, most of the rain falls in the
months of October and May.
, During the season of prevailing
rains the rainfall is often heavy and
of short duration. The heaviest on
the entire Island was recorded at one
of the mountain stations when twenty
' three inches fell , in twenty-three
hours.
The need of the irrigation system
on the south side of the Island and !
not on the North side is explained by '
the fact that, because of the topo
graphy generally the north side has!
plenty of rain.
The interior of the Island is moun
tainous. It is traversed by a main .
divide of about 25,000 feet elevation!
running east and west a short distance '
from the southern coast throughout!
its entire length. "There are secondary

divides farther north, which are par
allel to it. Porto Rico is on the Zone
of the Trade Winds which furnish it
moisture; because of their prevailing
north east and easterly direction most
of their moisture is precipitated on
the northern slope. Thus the mean
annual rainfall in the northern part
of tne Island is in places from 10U to
inches and more; while in the
southern part it averages about 45
inches and in many places below 40
inches, and with a minimum yearly
rainfall recorded at Aquirre in 1907
of 21 inches.
Irrigation was resorted to for many
years but the supply of water was
very insufficient. The need of a
large centralized system to conserve
(he flood waters that were going to
waste was generally recognized. Dur
ing Spanish posssession several at
tempts .were made to develop such a
system, but failed. Finally in 1907
under American administration the
legislature passed an appropriation
and a study of the possibilities was
made.
The project of furnishing water to
make more fertile and certain of pro
duction 35,000 acres of tillable land
on the south side of the Island has
been accomplished by the Porto Rico
Irrigation Srvice, under the direction
of M. V. Domenceh, Commissioner of
the Interior. J. W. Beardsley class
'91 College of C. E. Cornell Univer
sity was Chief Engineer. Many of
those employed in the Irrigation Ser
vice were compelled to live in the
greatest discomfort; but they stuck to
the job and over came legions of ob
stacles. The entire work was most
efficiently and economically managed.
No public or private enterprise ever
undertaken in Porto Rico not even
the construction of the highways has
caused to be .distributed in a like per
iod of time so great a sum of money
as that spent lor wages on the irriga
tion work.
The entire system completed repre
senta an outlay of something over
$4,500,000. This money was provid
ed by the sale of 4 per cent 30-year
bonds. The entire cost of both con

Government has not supplied any
money spent in the irrigation project,
but it has guaranteed the redemption
of the bonds and this guarantee was
made in order to obtain credit for

LEMING-KENYON WEDDING
Fnenas of Frank S. Kenyon will be
interested in the following account of
the marriage of this Wauseon boy,
which occurred last Thursday evening,
taken from The Daily Republican of
Cape Girardeau, Mo., issue of Friday
December 1st:
The wedding of Miss Rose Leming
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. M. E. Lem
ing, to Mr. Frank S. Kenyon last night
at Centenary Methodist Church was
one of the most brilliant social events
of the season.
JThe ceremony was performed at
8130 o'clock by Dr. J. C. Handy.
Miss Flint sang a solo before the cer
emony, also Miss McClelland, who
sang "The Wedding Day", written by
the bridegroom for the occasion.
The bride entered on the arm of
her father. She was beautifully
gowned in ivory satin, combined with
tulle and silver lace. The long court
train was of tulle and satin. The
veil, worn Juliette fashion, was held
to the train with sprays of orange
blossoms. She carried a shower bou
quet of roses and lilies of the valley.
Mrs. Paul Leming served her sister
as matron of honor and was gowned
in white tulle over silver with silver
trimming. The train was lined with
the same shade of red as the large
bunch of Russel roses which she car
ried. The bridesmaids Misses Ruth
Glenn, Leona Cunningham and Marie
Weber, were gowned alike in white
tulle with silver trimmings, and car
ried large bunches of Russel roses.
Little Miss Frances Leming, a sis
ter of the bride, acted as flower girl.
fane was daintily gowned in white silk
and carried a large basket of the
same roses as the maid3. Master Ed
ward Rozier Leming, the bride's neph
ew, served as ring bearer and was
dressed in a white corduroy.
The sirjom' was attended by hi3
brother, Mr. Darby Kenyon, as best ,
man. Fletcher Rhodes, William
Leming and Griffen McCarthy were
the groomsmen and Liston Comer,
Paul Leming and Elmer Leming were
ushers.
The church was artistically deco
rated with ferns, southern smilax and
white chrysanthemums.
After the ceremony a small recep
tion was held at the home of the
bride's parents, to which only the
families and a few jntimate friends
were invited. The house was beauti
fully decorated in green and white.
The dining room was done in Ophelia
roses and white tulle.
While the reception was at its
height the bridal couple slipped away
and disappeared. It is said they were
driven to Illmo to take the Cotton
Belt train for somewhere.
Among those from out of town
who attended the wedding were:
Mrs. F. L. S. Darby and Mr, Frank
E. Kenyon of Wau3eon, Ohio; Mr.
Earnest Comer, Indianapolis; Mr.
Ralph Leming, Comersville, Indiana;
Mrs. A. R. Ponder, San Antonio,
Texas; Mr. and Mrs. Edward Rozier,

Pomona Grange of Fulton County
Holds Final Meeting of Year 1916
In - Wauseon Booster Club Enter
tains at Cuncheon Enjoyable Af
ternoon Session.
One of the happiest events of the
year 1916 in Wauseon was the meet
ing of Fulton County Pomona Grange
in Wauseon last Friday.
The forenoon session was private,
devoted to the ritualistic work and
Dusiness of the Grange.
There were six of the subordinate
Granges of the county represented
and seventy-hve members in attend
ance; two new members were receiv
ed. Owing to the removal of Deputy
Master, E. P. Ames to Columbus, M.
G. Aumend was elected Deputy Mas
ter. A committee consisting of O. O.
Walters, W. E, Patterson and M. G.
Aumend was appointed to prepare a
program for the meetings of the
Grange for next year. - '
A Kesolution to amend the by-laws
was passed and other business trans
acted. The next meeting of Pomona
Grange will be held at Ottokee on the
fourth Saturday in January 1917.
The Grange members were the
guests of the Wauseon Boosters Club
at luncheon which was served in Py
thian Castle Hall at noon by the ladies
of Wauseon Temple Pythian Sisters;
about 125 grangers and business peo
pie of Wauseon sat down to a sub

Mr. D. W. Williams read a most in-

ed and then went on to show that the
interests of both farmers and busi
ness men were identical; that each is
dependent upon the other and that
neither is independent. Each must
be ready to give and to receive; each
must have confidence in the other
and to insure such confidence there
must be honesty on the part of each.
Mr. Knapp illustrated the point he
wished to make by citing a case of a
farmer who took a load of first class
corn to market for which the dealer
paid him a first class price; his neigh
Dor learning what price had been paid
takes an inferior load; of corn to the
same dealer and the dealer for fear
of losing the business and good will
of the second man pays more for the
corn than it is actually worth. This
is not honesty; all should come to
gether on a plane of equality.
Mr, F. H. Reighard was the sec
ond speaker on this topic and strong
ly emphasized the modern idea of
working not so much for individual
as community interests; he also ad
vocated the practice " of merchants
and business men visiting the farm
ers in their homes, mutual active in
terest in good roads and schools and
close social association which will re
sult in mutual confidence.
Mr). Reighard also Spoke of the
mail order business and urged organi
zation; it is team work that counts;

for the interests of the whole com
munity. The speaker also strongly
advocated a Farmers Protective As

with his solos, "Mother McCree" a

"Nobody."

Monday evening's session of tha
council was a long1 and busy one; tha
urst item taken under consideration
after the routine business of the coun-f
cil had been disposed of was the mat
ter of night watchmen for the village
streets. The Boosters Club had pre
viously taken up the matter and in
view of the many daring burglaries,
which have occurred . in this vicinity
lately it was deemed wise by the busi
ness men to provide for some sort of
protection for the town. As an emer
gency measure the club had engaged,
two watchmen to patrol the town,
nights and a committee waited upon
the council Monday evening to ask;
them to co-operate in maintaining'
night watchmen. Mr. Howard Lyea
acting as spokesman for this commit
tee, presented the matter to the coun
cil and this body immediately resolved,
itself, by common consent into a com
mittee of the whole to consider how
they might meet the request; tha
question being not as to expediency
but of finance: After a canvass of
the financial affairs of the village, and
consultation with the city solicitor tha
council informed tlje committee that
they could and would furnish $50.00
per month for the next four months
for this purpose. Plans were later
perfected whereby the business men,
of the town are to contribute the bal
ance necessary to maintain a night:
