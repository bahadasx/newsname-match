pears in Court, Puts Up Bond for

Early in the morning, it looked as
if the returns were not going to show
up in spite of the earnest plea sent
.but by Osborn the day before. They
did not come in the morning mail,
and the wires were soon hot in a
northerly direction. Osborn finally
managed to get the Coconino super
visor's office, only to find but that the
clerk had gone to the Little Colorado
river. Osborn was rather disgusted,
and made up his mind that there was
no chance to get out the returns yes

showed up, and the count started
with a bang.
It took the governor, and Justice
. Ross about two hours to finish the
job.

Maricopa county by Governor Hunt
yesterday afternoon. Gov. Hunt ac
companied by his counsel, Hon Eu
gene S. Ives, Homer R. Wood and
' Attorney General Jones represented ;
themselves at the office of the clerk '
and filed a statement a petition for
an inspection of the votes and a
bond in the sum of $300. The bonds
men of the governor are Mr. Wood
and Chas. R. Howe, tax commission
er. The governor deposited the
customary fee of $10 and his at
torney had a short conference with
Judge Stanford as to the next step.
The petition brings every ballot

etrery ballot cast but not counted for

aid counted for Mr. Campbell "in
each and every precinct of each :ind
every county in the state," also that
within the same territory vots for
the contestant were not counted.
The statement further sets forth
that this action was taken after a
canvass of the returns from the vari

been counted for the contestee and

BOOZE TO FLOW IN STATE
TILL FIRST OF. YEAR
i
PHOENIX, Dec. 4. Governor
I Hunt has decided to let the
! booze flow into Arizona until the
J end of the year Senator Ives,
vised him to give the outside
liquor houses and the carriers
two weeks' notice after the vote
is canvassed by the secretary of
state, so that they may get all of
the shipments delivered. If
the governor would issue the
proclamation declaring the law
in effect just as soon as the vote
I is canvassed, as contemplated by
the constitution, the carriers
would be caught with a lot of
undelivered liquor on their
hands and, under the law, there
j would be nothing to do but de
I stroy it, as the law prohibits the
! movement of liquor in the state.
I As thn liquor houses who have
been taking orders in Arizona
have been guaranteeing the de
livery of the booze, they would
I be the losers by the transaction
By giving them plenty of notice,
j Governor Hunt will eable them
j to continue to reap a big harvest
and the carriers to profit by re-
turns from freight and express
j shipments.

HEAVY SHIPMENTS
OF PERSONAL USE
The local transfers were worked to

booze around. Clifton. About a car
load was received by freight and it
is expected that large consignments
will be brought in by express before
Governor Hunt issues his proclama
tion declaring the state "bone" dry,
whatever that may mean later on.
Bone dry states havs been awfully
wet when the underground route has
been open, but in Arizona the best
is hoped for.
Bootleggers are an awful expense
in the state. While Greenlee compel
led a few to take the count, other
counties have been less fortunate.
Even the government is put up
against the task of catching the fel
low that will take a chance . on dis
pensing "fire water" to the Indian.
On Colorado Indian reservations the
bootlegger has dispensed alcohol in
the form of Jamaica ginger and lem
on extracts better than 50 per cent.

FOREST BUSINESS
BY WIRELESS
Apache Ranger Flashes ' Message
from White Mountains to Clifton.
Albuquerque, N. M-, Nov. 28. A
message received here this morning
from District Forester Redington,
who . inspecting the Apache National
Forest in Arizona, states that a wire
less message was transmitted yester
day from the Baseline Ranger Station
to Clifton. The distance is forty
miles. This is believed to be the
first time that wireless has been used
7 nsacting National Forest busi
ne.. """
The outfit was installed by Forest
Ranger Warner and Ray Potter of
Clifton and cost $75.00. An ordinary J
telephone line between
VJLli CI 11 1
Baseline would cost at leats $100.00
per mile or $4,000.00.
The transmittal of the message
demonstrated the practicability of
overcoming the heavy "static" inci
dent to the dry climate of the South
west, and Forest officers hope that
wireless telephony will be the next
development in the National Forest
communication system . Wireless
would eliminate the cost of special
telegraph operators incident to an or
dinary wireless system and would be
of incalculable value in combatting
forest fires and transacting general

The Nogales Oasis alludes to the

The petition states that the contest

an inspection of the ballots and prays
that one inspector may be named by
him, one by the contestee and one
appointed by the court. In the con
ference with Judge Stanford, Mr.
Ives designated Homer R. Wood of

SHERIFF CASH
PAPERS FILED TUESDAY WITH
GRAVE CHARGES ARE DROUGHT AGAINST THE ELECTION
BOARDS AND VOTERS OF BLUE AND EAGLE
PRECINCTS., SHERIFF CASH CLAIMS
ELECTION BY MAJORITY OF 268
On Tuesday afternoon papers were
filed with the Clerk of the Superior
Court in which Sheriff J. G. Cash
begins contest proceedings in the
recent general election. The action
is brought on account of the close vote
forrthe office of sheriff between Cash
and Slaughter in the election and also
on account of alleged irregularities
in counting the ballots in the various
precincts of the county as charged
in the complaint.
4
The allegations as set forth
mention irregularities on
the art of officers on the vari
ous precinct election boards in
throwing out ballots not properly
marked for the contestant arid
counting them in favor, of the
contestee. Grave charges are
also brought against the elec
tion boards and voters of both
Blue and Eagle Precincts, al
leging that liquor was freely
distributed at these polling
places in order to influence the
action of the voters; also that
at these polling places suitable
booths were not arranged and
that the voters were compelled
to mark their ballots in the
presence of each other and
where they could be plainly
seen. On this account the
statement of contest claims all
votes cast at the two places
should be thrown out and disre
garded. --
In conclusion the statement of con
test claims 1031 legal votes for the
contestant and 763 votes for the
contestee, which would make a ma
jority for the contestant of 268 votes
and thus declare his election.
The full text of the statement of
contest follows:

L MEMORIAL
SOLEMNIZED
BY ELKS
Princess Theatre Well Filled With
Attentive Audience at Elks
Memorial Services on Sunday Last.
On last Sunday. December 3rd. tha
Princess Theatre was the BcenA of nnji
of the most impressive Memorial Day
exercises ever given by Clifton Lodge
No. 1174, B. P. O. Elks. In ac
cordance with a long established cm
torn the local members of the order
gatnerea on this day to do honor to
their departed brothers and eulogtae
their . memories in song and speech,
and the motto of the order, "The
Faults of Our Brothers we Write
Updn the Sands; their Virtues upon
Tablets of Love and Memory," was
exemplified to the fullest degree.
The spacious auditorium was
crowded with friends and members
of the order and promptly at 2:30 fully
one hundred Elks, who had met at
the lodge rooms, filed into the thea
tre to the strains of march music
rendered by Adams' orchestra and
took the places assigned them. The
decorations on this occasion were the
most beautiful and elaborate ever
attempted by the Clifton lodge. At
the back of the stage was draped a
large American flag, while the stage
itself was banked in a bower of cut
flowers and ferns. The front of the
stage and the orchestra pit was a
mass of beauty, carnations, ferns and
lilies of the valley being used in pro
fusion in the decorative scheme. In
the center of the proscenium arch
hung a huge wreath of ferns and
carnatioss and across the foot of the
stage was artistically draped silk
bunting in purple and white. the
colors of the order. In fact the
flattering comments pon the decora
tive effect were a decided compliment
to the committee in charge of the ar
rangements. . The program was excellently render
ed and the orchestral as well as voeal
selections were much appreciated.
The opening ceremonies were con- i
ducted by the officers of the lodge J
with Peter Riley, Exalted Ruler, in
charge. During these ceremonies a
large tablet was unveiled by Miss
Leah Abraham upon which were elec
trically flashed the names of the de
parted brothers as they were called
by Louis Bernstein, secretary of the
lodge. Those who have passed to the
Great Beyond and whose names were
thus commemorated were: Leonard
G. Scott, C. E. Deardorf, William E.
Spaw, Drue Underwood, J W. Moon,
E. C. Heck and Archibald Morrison,
At the conclusion of this impressive
part of the ceremonies, the regular
program was carried out. The mem
orial address was delivered by Hon.
Mulford ' Windsor, of Yuma, who was
at his best upon this occasion and
received the close attention of the
audience to his address of nearly p.n
hour. His address consisted chiefly
of the good the order was accomplish
ing in its unobstructive manner, its
aims and principles and the things for
which it stood. He also devoted
some time to the conduct of the offi
cers and the manner in which the du
ties of the officers. His remarks
were most interesting and the con
clusion of his speech was sincerely
regretted by the audience.
The eulogy was delivered by the '
Rev. Allan Krichbaum, of Morenci, -and
those who have often heard him
speak along different lines expressed
the sentiment that this was one of '
the most eloquent testimonials of his
capability as a payer of tribute on
such an occasion He extolled the mem
ory" of each departed brother in turn
and paid a glowing tribute to their
virtues and condoning their faults, to
which all humans are heir. His re
marks were made with deep feeling
and were received by a responsive
measure by his hearers, nearly all of
whom were intimately associated in
life with the deceased ones.
The memories brought up at -this
time, together with the Impressrt.
ness of the occasion, will long linger
in the minds of those present and the
fact that life is but a short span and
endures for but awhile, when the
great day of resurrection shall come
and brothers shall be reunited once
again, is brought forcibly to our at
tention. "For Life Leaps the Grave;
the Sleepers Shall Rise, Hope Never
Ends, and an Elk Never Dies."
The arrangement committee who
were in charge of the program 'and
decorations for this occasion and
who deserve a great deal of credit
and commendation for the manner in
which the affair was conducted con
sisted of M. E. Crawford, F. A.
Sanders, Neil Thompson, A. A Clem
ent, and J. C. Gaines.
Phillips-Graves
George Phillips and Miss Edna
Graves were married last week at the
