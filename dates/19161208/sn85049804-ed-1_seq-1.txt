Danger Signal.
If the lire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help to
put out the fire It is much the same
way with a cough. A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire bell.
You should no more try to suppress
it than to stop afire bell when it is
ringing, but should cure the disease
that causes the coughing. This can
nearly always be done hy taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. Many
have used it with the most beneficial
results. It is especially valuable for
the persistent cough that so often
follows a bad cold or an attack of the
grip. Mrs. Thomas Beeching, An
drews, Ind., writes: "During the win
ter my husband takes cold easily and
coughs and coughs. Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy is the best medicine
for breaking up these attacks and you
cannot get him to take nay other."
Obtainable everywhere.
