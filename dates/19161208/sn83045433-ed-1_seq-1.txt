for the first time since his return tc

HI might have lost more if Mrs.

Oliver, Mrs. Miller rushed over to hir

Chlc(Ago. Dec. 7-Employers were dcbi

ovwing a decision of tLe United States
7ircuit Court of Appeals holding that
>icketing is the inherent right of the Ia

on of the District Court at East St.
L ouis. which enjoined the Tri-City Trade
,ouncil from picketing the plants of the
lImerican Steel Founderies at Granite

iecision of the lower tribunal was "too
Irastic." '
The decision says the sight to strike
a too flanly established to merit discus
ion and that picketing to ascertain whom
he former employer has hired #nd to
,ersuade these persons to quit the em
cloyment is legal. The lawfulness of
ticketing is not to be tested by the inter

FORCED SERVICE
URGED BY SCOTT
Chief of Staff Also Advocates
Universal Training
for Army.
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, Chief of Staff of
the United States army. in his annual re
port to the Secretary of War, co nea out
flat-footed for compulyry service and
universal training.
"The volunteer system in this country."
the report states. "should be relegated to
the Oast. There is no reason why one
womar's son shoulli go out and defend
or be trained t defend another woman
and her son who refuses to take training
or give service. The only democratic
method is every man in his youth to
become in order that he may ren
der efficient service if called upon It
war."
While no direct critlism of the Na
tonal Gua'd is contained in the report,
Gen. Scott expresses the view that the
system is inadequate for the military de
tense of the country.
Speaking in defense of his advocacy of
universal training, Gen. Scott said: "Uni
vereal military training has been the
cornerstone upon which has been bui.
every republic in the history of the world.
and its abandonment in the signal for d
cline end obliteration. This fact was
fully recognised by the makers of our
Constitution and evidenced in our early
laws."
The report deplores the fact that the
regular army. in spite of its brilliant
reqrd on all the pages of American his
tory. was held in such low esteem by a
large element to the country that some
States found it necessary to pass la
'making it an offense to show disrespe,
to the American uniform. Gen. Scott aiso
called attention to the fact that the
right t- Vote is extended to "aliens of q,
few months' residence who have declared
their intention of becoming citizens."
'while It is denied to men in the miitary
and navai service. "put'Wtg them tn a
e1cah with the eiminal and inane."
Under the present systrm in the reru
lar army. the general's report stat., the
army goes Into the labor markrt for .ts
irecruits. If wages are high. ,-rutn.i
is at its lowest ehh. If wages are 1, w.

tonight formally accepted the 3eW
ship ad the oce of First LArd ef the
Tresury at an audience with the M.
He, ted to form a miniery.
unoement to this 6et Was
made late this evening.
Apart from this formallt the d
brought no important deveomsnt. The
House of Commons adjourned umtB Tue0
day. It is expected that the rfan list
of the cabinet will be announoed by that
day.
Lloyd George's present plea, toward the
realization of which he set to w1eebe
day at numerefs conferenes, is mid
to be a ministry of twelve member., in
cluding fye Unionists, five LJberals and
two Laborites.
Liberals to Mave Velae.
Reports of a liberal allotment t ee.
in the affairs of the government to rep
resentatives of the labor party formed
the outstanding feature of the day. The
new premier, himself of humble birth.
was generally expected to take this
course, but now that It is about to be
come a fact, the public and partieularly
the Tory element, finds it diffielt to -
custom Itself to the Idea.
Lord Northcliffe stated tonight is -
Interview that he Preferred his editeria
chair to a seat In the cabinet. His news
papers extended a cordial welcome to the
new premier. the Times remarking that
his success depended "largely on him
self and his often-tried power of rallying
rren of talent and entbudsa to his 0
side..
In addition to two seats IN the Cebast
reported to be awaiting George NIc
Barnes, Labor member of Parliassent for
the Black Friars division of Glasgow, a
privy councillor, and Arthur Henderson.
president of the board of education in
the Asquith goverrment-the Lber partY
is expected to be reproeented by one
member on the war council. Three under
secretaryships also are to go to Labor
ites, it is reported.
Laborttee to Cofew.
Labor member@ have been Invited to
a conference with the new premier at
the war office. when a full agreement
is expected to be reached.
Less easy sailing is predicted for
Lloyd George's efforts to list Liberal
representation. His feud with AsqUith
has naturally extended to all Ot the
members of the now defUaet Osali --
government. rlhe Litseral war -
mittes has, however, pledged nt o
oraration and the party wil meet un
der Asquith's chairmanship tomorrow.
The result of that meeting will hinge
on the question whether Lloyd
Georgpe' foes are prepared to 'get
even" with the man who overthrew
them i".i . they will place the
country's interest above their personal
grievance. The latter decirion is
looked for.
What the Labor party's stead will
be In the councils in which they will
now have an important voice was
foreshadowed today when the party's
representation in Parliament Passed a
resolutior expressing the, hope for the
settlement -I the Irish question and of
a vigorous and concerted prosecution
of the war.
