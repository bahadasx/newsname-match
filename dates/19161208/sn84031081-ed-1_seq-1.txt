to present to the house ot commons
his new national ministry, represent
ing all parties with, the possible ex
ception of the nationalists, and, if
common report is t0 be trusted, com
prising a strong business element.
Misgivings DisapiH'ur.
Misgivings, to a large extent, have
disappeared, mainly owing to the fact
lhat he has been ..le to ,'ain the
support of the labor party by an offer
cf two ministerial posts and three
uniit-r-secretaryships.
With the vote of the laborites, to
gether with the bulk of the unionists
and a large section of the liberals,
demanding more energetic prosecu
tion of the war, Mr. Lloyd-Genrge
will probably command a working
majority in tho hous of commons,
while a further asset will be the
liencvolent neutrality, even of the
Mipportcrs of the late cabinet in the
national Interests.
Probablv many parliamentary and
ministerial traditions will be jettl-
Hnnorl fr... Mr I.lnvd-George has a
leputation for courage and boldness,
and is not a great stickler for tradi
tion. Therefore some surprises may
nppear in the determination of the
r.ew officers. What already is ap
parent, however, Is that the new min
istry will not, as was at first assumed,
be a mere glorified war council of
only a few members, but a ministry
on the old lines, but much smaller
than the Asquith administration.
One Difficulty Ahead.
How Mr. Lloyd -George proposes to
get over the difficulty of his own
making, when lie declared that the
premier was too occupied to be able
l0 preside over the war council, is still
one of the problems unsolved.
Provincial liberal newspapers like
the Manchester Guardian and the
Liverpool Post make, a plea to the
liberals to give the government a fair
chance, as" it is generally asstimed
that it, Is embodiment of Ilritish de
termination to win the war. Accord
ing to one estimate, Mr. Lloyd-George
can rely on the support of virtually
all the unionist members and of sev
enty liberals, and hopes to obtain the
hacking of the labor members, who
1U come to a final declsian at
meeting today. It is also represented
that Mr. Lloyd-George believed he
will be able to offer concessions to
the nationalists which will bring them j
Into power. j
As far as tho cabinet is concerned,
the new premier tias a nucleus in A.
Eonar Law, Ijord Derby, Lord Cur-
on. Sir Frederick R. Smith and Sir
Edward Carson, whilo Viscount Head-

liamentary under-socrctary for muni
tions, is almost certain to have a
place in tho cabinet, and Colonel Win
ston Spencer Chin chill , former first
lord of the admiralty, is slated for a
high office.
I'ndor the circumstances it Is be

and that by Monday the new govern
ment will meet tho house of commons
to learn wnat manner of reception
will be accorded it. A '.est "f strength
can be made on the vote of credit,
which must le moved immediately.
Today's session of the house of
Commons was expected to bo a for
mal one, it being doubtful whether
any of the ministers would put in an
appearance.
Twelve MenilxTs.
It is understood Mr. Lloyd-George
is aiming nt a cabinet of twelve
! members, five of them unionists, five
I liberals and two labor representa
tives. From this number a small war
council is to be appointed. The labor
parliamentary party today adopted a
resolution expressing the hope that
"in this supreme crisis an endeavor
will be made by the new government
to settle the Irish question and bring
about the widest measure of co-operation
of all forces and energies of the
nation and the empire."
The Chronicle says Mr. Llloyd-
George Is bound to favor a more
strong labor policy, including state
control of all coal fields and other
large developments in tne direction or
administration pure an,) simple, look-
j ing to the needs of the war alone,
which the newspapers say is the prime
necessity
of the movement. There

Washington, Dec. 7. Germany's ac
ceptance of responsibility for the
sinking without warning of the Brit
ish liner Arabia, with the explanation
that her submarine coiiiinandcr took
the vessel for an auxiliary warship,
has brought the issue over submarine
Warfare to a more serious and clear
cut basis than anything that has hap
pened since the threat of the 1'nited
Slates last April to break diplomatic
relations after the torpedoing of the
channel liner Sussex.
Such Infoi ination as the American
government now lias tends to show
that the Arabia was a passenger ship
of the Peninsular and orient line,
l'iastng throiiiih Die Mediterranean on
a regular voyage. Among the passen
gers was an American citizen, who
was rescued.
Regrettiiblc Mistake,
The German note, made public to
day hy the state department, says if
official (lata is furnished showing that
the vessel was an ordinary passenger
steamer, "this then would be a regret
table mistake from which the Ger
man government would promptly
draw the appropriate conseiiicnccK."
It Is assumed here that the conse
iiuenees would be an expression of
regret and offer of reparation for any
Injury or danger buffered hy the
American on board.
The note has been referred to I'res-

While Secretary Uinsing refused all

that Germany's admission to the

the Marina case, when six Americans

the sinking of the American steamer

much anxiety. The temporary quiet

PICIAL DIIPATCH TO HORNIN JOURNAL!
Washington, Dec. 7. The fallura
the voluntary system, as embodied
i ,.f
In the Hay law, is now admitted on
all sides, the Isst testimonial to that
effect being given in the annual re
port or Maj. Gen. Hugh U Heott, chief
of staff of the tinny, which was made)
j public today. Regarding the feder
lahzed national guard, General Scott
I s.is:
"111 my judgment the country will
ver be prepared for defense until
-
we do so as other great, nations ao
I country gels In return. There is no
reason w hy one woman s son snouui
j go out. and defend or be trained to
defend another woman and her son
who refuses to take the training or
(give service. The only democratic
; method Is for every man in youth to
I become trained In order that he may
i render efficient service if called upon
' In war."
t Taking up the question of the na
jtional guard In. Its federal status,
I General Scott declares the tralnliiMT
period of seventy-five days in threo
years provided hy the new national
defense act Is wholly inadequate,
I'nfit for War.
"In my Judgment," he s.y.-, ''it pre
cludes this force, from beingt nmdo fit
for wr Hi'-vlee until it bes rui tv'i
j at least six months' additional train
I ing In timo of w ar."
The report reiterates the opinion,
that it takes a year of inlr.a-Ue train
ing to make a soldier, and auiis mat
the country and congress appear to
have a vital misconception of the
facts In this regard. Unless the fed
eralized liiiard which congress sub
stituted for the cltlnen volunteer army
advocated by the general staff can bo
given greater training, General Scott
suys, the country faces a serious sit
uation. "And it is very doubtful," lie con
tinues, "we will he able to do so and
keep the force recruited. "Tho diffi
culty that is now being experienced In
oblainltig recruits for the regular
n rmy and for the national guard in
servi on the border, raises sharply
the ipiestion of whether we will bo
able to recruit the troops authorised,
in the national defense act."
ICi'riiiling Is Mow.
In spile of the fact, that the pre
paredness agitation stimulated Inter
est while the effort now being nitidis
to bring the border forces up to war
strength, C.ehcrarScItt "Assf Its. tlfreo
months of recruiting, left many mi
tional guard nulls still below mini
mum strength. F.vcry effort wa
made to get the men, he says, a
house-to-house canvass being conduct
ed In .some sect ions.
"The .failure," say tho report,
"should make the whole people real
ize that, the volunteer system does not
and probably will not, give us eitheif
Ihe men we need for training In peaco
or for sor Ice in war."
General Scott gives at length statis
tics on the national guard mobiliza
tion available when his report whs
written September 30. Ho shows that
In all stales with 16,000 enrolled
ttiiurilMincn guardsmen ut the time of
the call, more than 10 per cent failed
to respond and 2!l per cent of Ihe re
mainder could not passed required
physical tents, making the force 43 per
(cut raw recruits when it went to tha
hoi di r. Brought up to w ar strength,
he savs. the force would have been 75
I per cent green men and useless for
war purposes for many months.
'These figures probably hold good
for ihe entire body of the national
guards," the report adds.
hat Ihe l ads show.
An aggregate force of 1 51, OH offi
cers and men of the guard were mus
ti red into the federal scrvico under
i the i all and about 1 lo.!r.7 were on tho
border a month and a half after tho
I call was issued. The general com
I mends highly the efficiency of tho
railroads in handling the mobilization.
Turning to the recruiting In the reg
ular army, the report says that tho
service was 20.1 30 short of its au
thorized strength on August, SI last.
Between March l."i, when congress au
thorized bringing the army up to
war
ami
strength by adding L'O.BOO men,
August 31, only S,4ti3 men wera
en rolled.
"( N cause
for very sober consider-
tion on the part of every citizen In the
country when the fact Is fully under
stood, ' General Scott says, and also
"lhat the units of the national guard
and regular army has not been re
cruited to war strength In the crisis
we have just passed through."
The report snows that the mobilized
national guard force not only was
more than It". 000 below war strength,
but was more than 4,000 below au
thorized minimum peace strength.
