ASK FEDERAL ROAD AID—WISH
TO REPLACE BOYALTON
BRIDGE
The county board met in regular
monthly session. Tuesday with all mem
bers present.
Bond and oath of Samuel Trebby,
coroner, was presented to the board
and approved.
Itemized statement of V. Stewart
and A. H. Larson, who had charge of
the county exhibit at state fair show
ing a total receipt of $411.25 and ex
penditures of $257.01, showing a bal
ance of $154.24. $50.00 of said balance
was turned into the county treasury.
County road in Buh, Granite arid
Pulaski, was established as a county
road. .i
(The following resolution was then
"We, the County Board of Morri
son county have examined bridge Nb.
1825 over the Mississippi river on
state road No. 1, located between Sec.
8, Twp. 127, Rge. 29, and Sec. 32, Twp.
39, Rge. 32, known as the Royalton
bridge, and find the same in very dan
gerous condition and as it serves to
carry a very large volume of traffic it
is not possible to close it, so a new
bridge must be built at once at an es
timated expense of $35,000.00. As
the entire bridge is in Morrison coun
ty, the expense cannot be divided be
tween two counties ad is generally the
case with such large bridges. Further
more, very insistent demands are be
ing made for extensive road work on
a north and south route through
Morrison county, and
Whereas, The funds available are
entirely inadequate to care for thesp
two projects,
Therefore, We hereby petition the
Minnesota Highway Commission to lay
out a federal aid highway along the
following route:
From Royalton to Little Falls oyer
state roads 1 and 2, thence to tne
county line at Lincoln, over Btate road
No. 4.
We also request that $50,000.00 be
set aside for work on this route and
we hereby agree to expend not less
than an equal amount from the county
road and bridge fund together with
funds raised by subscription or oth
erwise, and to construct and maintain
the road in accordance with require?
ments of the State Highway commis
sion and secretary of agriculture.
This will enable us to finance the
construction of the Royalton bridge
with the assistance of our state aid
appropriation.

A resolution opposing the present*,
rates ^f the Water Power company
for Current as being unsatisfactory
both as to the manner of charge and
in amount, and wherein the council
expressed itself as not being averse
to the Water Power company giving
the proposed rates a fair trial, was
unanimously passed, a number of the
councilmen stating before the vote
was taken, that as they understood
the resolution the council was not get
ting behind the proposed rates. The
resolution is as follows:
"The common Council of the City
of Little Falls, Minnesota, being in
session duly assembled on the 4th day
of December, 1916, adopted the fol
lowing resolution:
Whereas, This Council appointed a
so-called eleetric rate committee) to
investigate and report to this Council
a schedule of electric rates that would
be more satisfactory than the rates
heretofore charged by the Little
Falls Water Power company of Min
nesota, and
"Whereas, Said committee has ren
dered to this Council a majority and
a minority report now on file with the
city clerk, and
'(Whereas, This Council believes
that, the rates heretofore charged by
said company are unsatisfactory botn
as to the amount of the charge and as
to the method of making tne same,
and
"Whereas, This Council is advised
that it does not have the power to es
tablish and enforce rates for electric
service rendered by said company,
and
Whereas, This Council is not in pos
session of sufficient facts to" know
whether the amount of charges now
made by said company are in reality
excessive or not, and

"Adopted December 4, 1916"
President Hall announced that Mr.
Gordon had stated that P. J. Vasaly,
a member of the light rate committee
and who made a i!T?nority report on
this question, had made the statement
that only 13 of the commercial pa
trons of the company would receive
reductions under the proposed rate.
Mr. Vasalvy who was present at the
meeting, denied having made this
statement, saying that he had stated
at the previous meeting of the coun
cil, that five of the commercial pa
trons would take up two-thirds of the
decrease and that eight more, mak
ing a total of thirteen, vould wipe out
the decrease, all the other reductions
being offset by increases. Mr. Hall
agreed that this was what Mr. Yasaly
had said.
The letter from Mr. Gordon, stating
that the rate asked for in the peti
tions, had to be refused, was Tead

FOR ENSUING YEAR
Horse racing promises to fee a part
of the program of entertainment at
the next county fair here, a commit
tee having been appointed by the fair
society at its annual meeting Tuesday
to organize a racing association and
to build a race track.
In" the election of officers for the
ensuing year George KieVel was chos
en president, to succeed T. O. Gordon.
N. N. Bergheim was re-elected secre

previous year and W. H. Ryan was re
elected treasurer. 1'. {j. Gordon,. M.
M. Williams, Charles Sylvester, A.
Simonet, Victor Beckman, David Mo
ran, Sam Hammerbeck, A. F. Koslos
ky and John Vertin were elected as
the board of directors. Mr. Gordon
and Mr. Beckman are the new mem
bers of the board.
The action of the board to borrow
$1400 from the First' National bank
with which to pay premiums was ap
proved and the secretary was in
structed to pay this back to the bank
as soon as the state aid is received.
The question of insuring the build
ings on the grounds came up and on
account of the high rate in the city,
the secretary was instructed to com
municate with some Farmers' Mutual
Insurance company and see whether
the buildings could be insured in such
Farmers' Mutual company.
Samuel Hammerbeck was elected
delegate to the annual meeting of the
State Fair society to be held in the
month of January.
The secretary reported that in con
formity to instructions of the board
of directors the officers had purchased
the Miller lots and that they had paid
for the lots and the moving of the
buildings approximately $500.00. The
meeting approved the action of the
officers.
The question of securing two and
one-half acres more land and prepar
ing a race traek was discussed and the
following committee #as appointed to
see what assistance can be secured in
the organization of a horse race asso
ciation at Little Falls: Charles Syl
vester, Sam LaFond, Barney Burton
and J. K. Martin.
This committee was instructed to
organize such a Horse Race associa
tion as the public sentiment seemed to
•be in favor of and to raise a sufficient
amount of cash, from persons inter
ested in horse racing, to pay for the
additional land necessary to be pur
chased, the moving of fenees and
(buildings and the making of a track,
it being understood that the fair so
ciety will not itself go into horse rac
tfcaMhe -aoeiety-will furnish
the ^necessary track and buildings-and
lease the same to the Horsei Race as
sociation, and that they work togeth
er for the holding of good races at
the time of the fair. The committee
was instructed to make investigations
and report to the board of directors
as soon as possible so that a track
can be prepared for next year's fair.
In connection with this the secretary
was instructed to negotiate with Mr.
Vertin for the purchase of about two
and one-half acres south of the pres
ent fair grounds and as soon as said
land was purchased to proceed to bring
an action in court to quiet title to all
the land held by the society so that
the title may be in proper shape in
case of the placing of a loan on the
same.
Albert Johnson made application to
become a member of the society, which
application was granted and a certifi
cate of stock issued to him,
