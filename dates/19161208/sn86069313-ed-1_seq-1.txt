TION IX REPUBLICAN PARTY
CALL MEETING;.
ADVANCE IS IMPOSSIBLE
Through Democratic Party. Says
Statement Announcing (Jonfer-
enco of Progrcvdvc.
Chicago, Dec 5. Overtures to the
Republican party for nolco in the
management of the party affairs in
return for Progressive support .were
made today in a statement which fol
lowed a conference, with Chester H.
Howell, of California, QlfTord Pin
chot, Raymond Robins, James It.
Garfield, William Allen White and
Harold L. Ickcs.
Permanent progressive advance
thru the Democratic party is Impos
sible, the statement sayx, In announc
ing that a national conference of
Progressives and Progressive Repub
licans Is to be called within four
months In tho hopes of bringing
about- recognition of the Republican
party.
Tho first stop towarcj. providing
progressive representation in tho par
ty, It was suggested, could be best
brought about by giving tho present
Republican Campaign Committee the
functions of tho Executive- Cotnmlt
toe. Progressive Vote Factor.
"The result of tho election has
tdiown that tho only hope of victory
for any political party In America
Jlei in securing nnd retaining sup
port of tho Progressive voters," the
xtatcment says: "In spite of certain
Progressive achievements, the merits
of which wo do not question, it is
clear to us that permanent Progres
sive ndvanco thru the Democratic
party Is Impossible.
"Wo welcome tho enactment of
progressive measures, by any party.
Hut we are firm In tho conviction that
lu tho existing two-party system,
constructive progresslvlsm may be
best achieved thru tho Republican
party. Rut to gain cither of these
ends, the Republican party must be
thoroly progresslvlzed in organiza
tion, leadership and principles."
"Wo propose to Join with other
progressives in calling a national
eonferenco of Progressives nnd Progressive-Republicans
to bo held dur
ing the next four months. Such a
conferonco might well take steps to
ward re-formulating Progressive
principles nnd considering how to
put them Into effect.
Initial Step Proposed.
"An Immediate; practical bte'p to
ward Progressive representation
would bo to give the present cam
paign committee in the party organ
isation tho functions of tho Execu
tivo Committee of tho party. This
committee consists of ten regular Re
publicans and six former Progres
sives. This would give tho Progres
sives votes as well as voices in tho
party council. A demand from tho
proposed conference for such repre
sentation in tho Republican organiza
tion could not bo Ignored by any who
ure seriously desirous of parly suc
cess and nothing less than this could
bo accepted as n first step toward se
curing the confidence of the Progres
sive votera of tho country.
"Wo believe tho Republican party
can get the Progressive votes and
that Progressive, votes, thru tho Re
publican party, can best secure tho
measures of political reform and so
cial Justlqo to which thoy aro devot
ed. Hut to obtain this, thero inuut,
lio some guarantee that Procrceslvo
support boforo election will insure
Progressive influence in tho deter
mination of Republican policies af
ter election.
"The Progressives are not sup
pliants nor penitents. They aro
American citizens, soeklng Justice
and ready to fight for it. Tho only
harmony that la desirable or possi
ble Is the harmony of Justice"
