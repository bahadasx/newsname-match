CHICAGO, Dec. 8.—The corner in

Eggs were down today five cents

POLICY BY
Submarine Situation Remains
Exactly as it Was When
Germany Was Told to
Stop Campaign.
SUSSEX NOTE HOLDS
Orowlfig Belief That Germany Over
stepped America's Man
dates in the Marina
Case.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Deo. 8.—America's
policy -toward the German submarine
situation remains exactly what it was
when this government told Germany
she must stop her ruthlees methods
of torpedoing. This, was stated of
ficially today, but there was reason
to believe that the United States had
not unalterably put up the gates at
least to brief discussion of serious
submarine'problems now before the
administration.
Taken at its face, the statement
that the American government stands
pat on her attitude expressed in the
Sussex notes, means that she would
break diplomatic relations if Germany
transgressed. There is growing be
lief that in the Arabia case at least
and perhaps in the Marina, she far
overstepped America's mandates.
But in line with a policy of avert
ing anything that might ultimately
lead to war, the administration is
regarded as likely to steer clear of a
breakup to the last possible point.
Experts believe that the Arabia
case presents a situation in which
Germany flouts American interpreta
tion of submarine rules and Ameri
can rights in* the matter.
Briefly, Germany admits her com
mander built up a structure of pre
sumption that the Arbia was a trans
port and hence warlike and then .pro
ceeded to sink her. The other side
of the picture lies in the American
memorandum of 'March 35. While that
applied to armed merchantmen—and
armament does not enter into Arbia
consideration—It laid down the prin
ciple: The determination of warlike
character must rest in no case upon
presumption, but upon, conclusive
evidence because the responsibility
fdr the destruction of life and prop
erty depends on the actual {pets of
the case and cannot be avoided or
lessened by a "standard of evidence
which a belligerent may announce as
creating a presumption of hostile
character^

LIBERTYVTLLE, 111., Dec. 8.—The charred body of Edward Madole, farmer, near

she lay in bed last night, locked the five children in the house and set fire to the place. It

Madole in a frenxy, seised the shotgun, firing at his wife at close range, filling her body
with shot.
Madole, thinking his wife dead after he had shot her at close range, dragged her from
the building, but finding she was still alive, plunged her head into a watering trough to
drown her.. She is in a dangerous condition at a hospital in Waukegan, 111.
