Business Increasing, More
Floor Space is Needed by
Concern.
Rapidly .Increasing business in both
the domestic and foreign fields has
actuated the heads of the Locomobile
Co. . of America to consider the erec
tion of additional factory buildings in
! Bidgeport. While it ' is known that
officials have discussed the problems
floor space needed in various depart
ments, no definite plans of location
"have as yet been perfected. It is con.
fridored that about 20,000 square feet
of floor pace will be needed.
With the rush orders for trucks for
(armgruse having been fully completed
the Locomobile Co. has found itself
confronted with greatly increased bus
iness which has been fabricated under
highly systematized conditions that
tend to give greater output in the

BOA
re to
Washington, Dec. 8. A new. note
to Germany on the general submarine
situation appears to be among the
possibilities which may come out of
the latest activities of the underseas
boats.
If decided upon, such a note would
be for the purpose of clearing up
what appear to be differences of in
terpretation in Washington and Ber
lin and as to what Germany's pledges
in the Sussex case covered, especially
as to armed ships. ,
Secretary Lansing" said today no
final course of action had been agreed
upon.
Although the state department has
been going on the principle of decid
ing each case separately on . its merit,
it was said today that the number of
cases had reached such proportions
that some general action would , be
justified, although it was made clear
that nothing had been determined
upon. , The day's developments in
the situation were:
The United States asked . Great
Britain for ' information . to deter
mine the status of the P. .& O. liner
Arabia, which a German submarine
commander took for an armed trans
port. , ' .: ..:''-

GIVE SUPPORT TO LLOYfl GEORGE
London, Dec. 8 The ' Manchester
Guardian says that -the "report that
Premier Lloyd ;George "will attempt an
immediate solution of the Irish ques
tion by means of an imperial confer
ence is not unlikely.
At a . meeting of the Liberals to
day, it was stated that A. J. Balfour
would be Foreign Secretary in the
new cabinet nd that Lord Robert Ce
cil would remain parliamentary secre
tary for foreign affairs.
The Reform Club today, passed a
resolution expressing confidence in Mr.
Asquith'and also the determination of
the organization to " support the new
government in whatever steps it may
take to prosecute the war vigorous
ly. A prominent Liberal, who attended
the Reform Club meeting, said:

GIRL WHO ELOPED
AT SEVENTEEN IS
SEEKING DIVORCE
Young .Woman Who Ran
Away With Musician Said
She Was Too Young.
The romantic elopement of Albert
B. Meath of this city and 17 year old
Adeline Maiello reached a prosaic
climax today when the young bride
filed, papers in the superior court aslc
ing for an annulment of the marriage.
As she is a minor the action was
brought on her behalf by her father,
G. Constantino Maiello.
Mrs. Meath alleges that Oct. 9,
1916,; she and Meath went to Darien
and were married. The girl says she
was too young to realize the serious
ness of the step she Was taking and
that Meath prevailed upon her to con
sent. She did not know she had to
have her parents' consent to get mar
ried, she declared. The complant
states that the plaintiff acted on a
sudden impulse. '
SUSP,
SAYS: NEW NOTE
m
E SENT
British ship Marina, torpedoed with
a loss of six Americans, was in no
sense a transport and was entitled to
the immunities of a peaceful mer
chantman. On both cases Germany has ex
pressed a willingness to offer amends
if her pledges were broken.
It was reiterated again today that
the United States stands squarely on
the position it took in the Sussex
case. This combined with Germany's
statement that she, too, holds to the
pledges she gave in that case, leads
officials to declare there seems to be
some difference in interpretation.
A new note, if it should be decided,
to send one, would be intended to
clear this up and make plain beyond
question that the United States ex
pects aH merchant ships, under inter
national law, shall not be destroyed
without warning or having crews and
passengers removed to places of
safety.
Affidavits on the sinking without
warning of the Italian liner Palermo,
on which state ' department records
show there were 23 Americans, are. be
ing collected as rapidly as possible.
As yet there are no indications, that
any American lives' were lost, but
from ..information at hand, the case
seems to parallel closely, the Arabia
and 'the Marina. , . ,
Mr. Asquith, our leader, advised that."
The Evening News, one of the
strongest ) supporters of Premier
Lloyd George, publishes prominently
a protest against the suggestion that
A. J. Balfour, be appointed foreign
secretary and Lord Robert Cecil re
tained as parliamentary under secre
tary for foreign affairs. It says:
"The great enthusiasm .with which
the formation of a new government is
received everywhere is damperted for
the moment by the persistent rumor,
on apparently good authority, that
Mr. Balfour is to go to -the foreign
office with Lord Robert Cecil. Lord
Robert's record in the foreign office is
well known. It would be nothing
short ' of disastrous if the man who
persistently adopted a policy leading
to the weakening of our blockade and
the consequent feeding .of the Ger
mans should again be placed in com
mand:" .

Youths He Befriended With

Rob His Store.
IGNORES GUNS AS
HE PUNCHES FOES
Would-Be Thieves Had
Lived on Victim's Purse
for Several Weeks.
Giuseppe Agusta, of 130 Willard
street, though only an humble tailoi, is
a philanthropist of 24 karat purity.
He presses young men's suits, if he
thinks them worthy, for nothing, lends
them $5 bills and even gets theirper
sonal effects out of "hock." It's his
pleasure. But when the youths he
has befriended poke guns at his head
and attempt to disgorge what money
he- has in his pockets Agusta will
fight.
Though looking down into the bar
rels of three revolvers at 7:45 o'clock
today the tailor never quivered an eye
lash. He doubled up his fists and
proceeded to wipe the floor with the
would-be gunmen. They were far
from being game and fled the wrath
of Agusta.
A week ago three young men, of
medium build and height ranging
from 25 to 30 years of age, came into
his store to get their clothes pressed
on credit. Agusta obliged them and
gladly placed the bill of $2.75, "on
the cuff."
Monday they came in and told Agus
ta they were good fellows, that they
knew he had a big heart and they
borrowed $5 each from the tailor. Yes
terday they told him they had a pin
and watch chain in a pawn shop
which they would like to recover.
Agusta closed his shop and came to
the city's centre with the men, pay
ing $4.75 for the effects and turning
them over to his needy friends.
The young men evidently . were not
satisfied with getting Agusta's money
by asking him for it, so this morning
they visited his tailor 6hop just before
8 o'clock. Three revolvers simulta
neously were thrust in his face and he
was ordered to throw hands up. But
ingratitude, to the tailor's mind, is
the most colossal ln to, which man
kind is' heiri It peeves him.
He smashed one of the gunmen in
the eye, walloped another in the. nose,
and grabbed the gun held by a' third
with one hand, shaking him by th
collar with the other. Two of the
would-be robbers frightened, ran
away, leaving the third to extricate
himself as best he could.
The latter managed deftly to slip
out of his over and under coat, leav
ing Agusta holding them in the air.
He escaped with his companions and
Detectives Gerrity and Kane are try
ing to find them. , Incidently the tail

HEIRS OF
OF ALIASES TO
GET INSURANC
First to Benefit by Bullard
Co.'s Welfare League
Arrangement.
James Zsalapor, who recently met
death in a fall at the factory of the
Bullard. Machine Tool Co., and who
was known by and kept a bank de
posit undr a different name in every
city where he lived, is first to receive
insurance under the' Welfare league
recently established by the factory
management. Szalapor's estate will
be increased by about $500 insurance
money from the Bullard Company.
Frank Polke, undertaker and a cred
itor, applied to the probate court to
day for the appointment of an ad
ministrator. Frank Smith, of the
Bullard Company, secretary of the
Welfare league, will be named ad
ministrator. Szalapor had bank accounts at
Yonkers, Rochester, Albany New
Haven and in Bridgeport amounting
to more than $300. In other cities
he was known as James Sculpia,
Djimayam Charpor, Deminian
Scharapo and as Jim Fisher. He
boarded in Atlantic street here. His

MASS VESTMENT
New Haven, Dec. 8 While he was
assisting at the services at Sacred
Heart R. C. church today, the sur
plice of Father Anselm Mayotte, a
curate,- took fire from a lighted can
dje. As the flames shot up the con
gregation was thrown into an uproad
bordering on a panic. Meanwhile
Father Mayotte assisted by an altar
boy calmly tore the burning garments
from his shoulders and then retired
to the vestry room. The altar boy's
gown also took fire but the flames
were soon put out. After he had
donned fresh vestments Father May
otte returned and proceeded with the
services. He was unhurt.
The congregation was a large one
as today is a holy day on the church
calendar.

OFFERED PLACE AS
INSTRUCTOR IN LAW
Partner He Assailed Has
Been Teacher of Spanish
In Association.
An investigation by Detective Frank
M. Holbrook, of the business and so
cial career of William Halliday, con
tractor and real estate operator, who
it is alleged attempted to kill his
partner, Francis Romero, in their
home 103 Garfield avenue, has re
vealed the fact, the police state, that
he lead a dual existence, as startling
in nature, as the fictitious career of
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
It was learned today that both men
attained great prominence in certain
circles since coming to this city. Hal
liday is a reader in the Christian Sci
ence church of this city. He was
active in the Y. M. C. A., and con
sidered a man of great learning on le
gal questions. His knowledge of the
law had so impressed the heads of
that institution that he had made ar
rangements to accept the position of
legal instructor in the Y. M. C. A.
The position, it is understood, would
be vacant next January.
Romero, contrary to previous opin
ions held by the police, is a scholarly
Spaniard, of high education and cul
ture, and was an instructor of lan
guages in the Y. M. C. A. at Main
and Gilbert streets. Halliday , has
been attempting to gain political
prestige and demoted coi&siderable
time, to canvassing voters in his dis
trict for Hughes during the last presi
dential campaign and worked hard in
opposition- to the proposed and re
cently .defeated- city charter.
Both men were fast attaining high
social "and business influence, when
the expose of Halliday's allege em
bezzlement, and firing of the Gilbert
dwelling at 105 Garfield avenue,
which he built, led to ; his attempt
to kill Romero.

BIG ROADS POT
'STRICT BAN ON
ALL SHIPMENTS
Pennsylvania and Erie Will
Not Accept Commodities
for Eastern Cities.
Chlnasro. Dec. 8. Etobargo orders,
which practically bar the west from
shipment of commodities ror export
from Atlantic ports or for eastern
consumption, went into effect on the
Pennsylvania ' lines and the Erie rail
road -st of Chicago today. The or
ders bar virtually every commodity.
No limit is set on the duration of
tho Amhare-o. which is attributed Uo
the congestion of loaded- freight cars
in the yards on the Atlantic seaboara.
Notice of the embargo was served
on the connecting lines by x the two
roads some time ago. The Pennsylvania-order
forbids agents to accept
freight from connecting lines which
is destined for points east of Pitts
burgh. The . Erie order fixes Marlon,
O., as the farthest east "point of des
tination. ' ,
Stable foodstuffs, which do not re
quire cold storage, are forbidden by
the embargo from going east of the
Pittsburgh-Marion lines. This would
apply to potatoes, flour, beet sugar
and canned goads. Such commodities
a ; wheat, corn, building materials and
manufacturing articles, are also
brought under the ban of the embargo
orders.
Local railroad officials asserted that
frequently cars of goods for export
have been shipped- without arrange
ments being made for bottoms to carry
their loads to Europe and that is a re
sult the tangle of freight cars has
grown so great that eastern roads
have found it difficult to carry on their
necessary business. Efforts of the
roads, it was aserted, to carry out the
recent '-ders of the interstate com
merce commission to return the cars
were only partly successful.
Officials ,of other roads, operating
east from Chicago, early today would
not comment on current rumors that
other lines intended issuing similar
orders.
Lorenzo . B. Nickerson,- general
agent of the freight department of
the New York, New Haven & Hart
ford Railroad, with offices in Bridge
port, commenting today on , the re
ported embargo of freight on the
Pennsylvania and Erie railroads
said:
"This action on the part of those
roads in stopping freight as far West
as Pittsburgh, and Marion, Ohio,
would indicate serious congestion not
alone in New England where the
New Haven road has now held an
embargo for ' several weeks, but at
tide-water points along the Atlantic
coast. It is by far the most radicaj
action yet- taken by. thew roadroads
to cope with over-shipments.
"We have about cleared up our
entire system and were beginning to
take freight from terminals of other
connecting roads, without serious
complaint from factories here or
other consignees. How the present
action bf the Pensylvania and Erie
railroads will effect this section I am
not prepared to say at this time for
I have not received official .knowledge
of the embargo or its conditions."
ELECTRICIAN IS
FATALLY SHOCKED
BY R. R. CURRENT
Powerful Physique of Young
. Bridgeport Fails to
Withstand Strain.
Shocked by a powerful electric cur
rent while at work yesterday after
noon, Frederick Rock, a young rail
road electrician, widely known here,
died at the Norwalk hospital at 10
o'clock last night. How the unfortu
nate man received the shock which
caused his death is still a matter of
conjecture. Rock's parents, his broth
ers and sister who live in this city
were summoned and were at. the bed
side when he passed away. Rock was
23 years of age but despite his youth
was of more than ordinary strength
and physical development. r
The circumstances of the fatality
have not yet been determined. Rock
with other electricians was at work
on the overhead- current carrying ca
bles, above the railroad tracks east of
the Norwalk station. Suddenly his
companions who . were on the same
steel stanchion with him, noticed that
the cables were swaying with more
than the momentum caused by wind
or air currents.
Next hey saw what they took to be
an old coat fluttering to the ground.
It was Rock's body. He had fallen
many feet. Strangely, he broke no
bones and except for severe bruises
sustained no other injury in his fall.
The deadly current had done for him,
however, and he was nn conscious
when his fellow worker.! reached him.
He was hurried- to the Norwalk hos
pital where the condition of the palms
of his hands indicated that he had re
ceived, into his body the electric cur
rent used to move railroad train
through the section where he had been
it " work. ' EVery possible medical at
tention was rendered and between the
time he reached the' hospital and the
hour of hisv death .the young man
gained consciousness several times,
only to relapse into p. state of coma
each time. - - ' , t
Because of his good physical coiid-i-tion.
his unusual strength and the fact
that he had" led an abstemious life',
the hospital physicians .believed the
young man had a fair chance of re
covery. The shock, however, proved
too great for his nervous eystem.
Rock was an athlete arid had played
football and baseball. He is survived
by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Patrick
Rock of 590 William jrtreet; a sister,
Annie Rock, and three ' brothers,
James, Frank and William T. Rock.
The last is an electrical contractor.
The body was brought to the family
home today.

in Crowded Road. -
Two firemen were severely
injured this . morning at Main
and Catherine streets when
they were jounced off the rear
of a big hose truck that skid
ded as the driver sought to
avoid hitting a vehicle in his
path.
Later in the morning only the pres- i
ence of mind of a fireman and aev- I
eral policemen prevented possibly fatal
accidents when Truck No. 1, speeding
past the city hall dashed, into a traf- i
flc-crowded section.
The injured in the accident to the ;
hose truck are:
James Neary, 28, hoseman, 65
Sanford avenue, concussion of the
brain, severe bruises and shock.
Thomas Reilly, S4, lieutenant En
gine Co. No. 5, fracture right an
kle, severe bruises. " ' "
-The first occurrence, in which both j
men were Injured when thrown from
a skidding auto truck, happened at
6:3d a. m. at Main and Catherine
streets while the apparatus was on the
way to a fife in the Brandegee build
ing, in George street, : where a defec-.
tive furnace flue caused damage of
less than 925. . :"'' -.''.
Only the " presence of mind of Po
liceman Daniel -Ryan and John J.'HaK
pin, known as the "bank policeman,"
Fireman George Rutherford and .oth
ers tn charge of, the .truck, saved pe
destriana and Truck No. 1 of Johri
street fronvtamage as it attempted
to turn a' corner while under rapid
headway, shortly after.. noon at State
and Main streets. ' The firemen wen
responding to an alarm of. fire frorara
lodging house . at 781. Main street,
where damage of less than 30 was
done to bedding and furniture when
some lodger left inflammable matter
in the room. '
Jn the first accident an alarm of fire
was rung in from box 331 at 6:29.
Under commiand of . Capt. Nicholas
Horan, Driver Charles Wafers left
Middle street, and turned up Congress
to Main. The big Mack, hose truck
was let out on the long stretch to
Catherine street. When approaching
that intersection, Lieutenant Reilly
and Hoseman Neary were standing
oh the rear platform.
Waters observed a truck coming
south in Main street, the driver ap
parently unconcerned' about the sig
nals of warning being souded by Capt.
Horan. As a last precaution Waters
slowed . his machine to . 1.0 miles an
hour to obviate hitting the truckman
and in the turn about the obstruction
the machine skidded on the snjooth
pavement and the driver felt the right
hind wheels graze the curb. The
shock was not sufficient to cause con- ,
cern even though it was found later
that one of the guard .rails had been
slightly bent.
Neither Capt. Horan nor the driver
felt concern for the two men in the
rear and the fire apparatus increased
speed and reached the fire in good
time. It was not until Capt. Horan
had climbed from his seat that it
was noticed Reilly and Neary were
missing. The incident was immedi
ately reported to Chief Daniel E.'
Johnson who ordered the truck back
to pick up the men, who were found
upon the grass- plot outside of a bill
board standing at the northwest cor
ner of of Main street. Both the am
bulance and the fire truck crews at
tended to carrying the injured men
to the hospital.
The fire on the second floor of the
building corner George and Oak street
gave the department little trouble.
The latter incident in which Truck
No. 1 almost overturned in Main St..
happened the truck passed city, hall
at full speed and the operator mis
calculated the speed in relation to
density of stalled traffic at the corner.
Fireman Rutherford, forseeing the
danger, shouted . to Policemen . Ryan
and Halpin who ,were able., to force
back 'a crowd of men, women and
children into the doorway of a local
shoe store just, as the . big., truck slew
ed over towards the sidewalk, balanc
ed itself on two wheels for a fall and
was apparently only saved by quick
action-of the driver and. tillerman In
changing the course and continuing

Nolie Bigamy Charge
Against Mary Farkas
Convinced that Mary Farkas hon
sstly believed her first husband dead
when she married- a second time.
Judge Rin-pee in the criminal superior
court this morning allowed a nolle on
the bigamy charge on which the wo
man has been held.
She admitted having been the wife
of John Farkas in Passaic, N. J., but
said he deserted her nine years ago.
She heard he was dead so .when she
came to this city she married Stephen
Schestyen. Afterward her -son ; went
to Passaic on a visit and brought back
word that Farkas was alive. After
ward he asked his wife to return to
him but because of his previous cruel
treatment she replied, "I would rather.
-e the rest of my life in prison than ,
-go back to you."
