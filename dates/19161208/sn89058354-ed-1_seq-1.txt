Charles Wright Last
Monday Night.
ORIGIN OF DIFFICULTY
IS STILL UNKNOWN
Tragedy Occurred At Home
Of John Beavers In Six
teenth District.
Bob Beavers, . 40, was shot
to death last Monday night by
Charles Wright, 35. Wright
surrendered to an officer im
mediately after the shooting.
There were no eye-witnesses
to the tragedy, and the caus
es of it are not known. Wright
and Beavers both spent the
day in Paris Monday, and re
turned home together that af
ternoon. It is said that both
were drinking.
The killing occurred in the
yard of the home of John Bea
vers, nephew of the dead man,
near Friendship, in the old
Sixteenth district.
It is supposed that the men
engaged in a difficulty prior
to the shooting, Wright having
been culfyfeeverely with a knife1,
supposedly in the hands of
Beavers. The opinion express
ed by some is that Wright shot
in self defense.
Funeral services were con
ducted for Beavers Tuesday

Rev: J. A. Baucum. Inter
ment at Sulphur Well grave

The preliminary hearing for
Wright has been set for Fri

The occasion'was one of con
siderable moment to the con

and the j work of raising the
necessary funds for the under

basement will be located the
Sunday school rooms, and this
j department will be fully equip
ped, i The auditorium will be
quite commodious, and a large
balcony will increase its seat
ing capacity.
When the building is com
pleted and furnishings install
ed, with the exception of the
pipe organ, the cost will total
about $14,000. Weather con
ditions permitting, it is hoped
that the building will be com
pleted by the middle of March.

ted by Otto Hauri, a local con
tractor. G. Tandy Smith, of
Paducah, Ky., is the architect.
