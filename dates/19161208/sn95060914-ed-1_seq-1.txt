Over Six Hundred Dollars To
Be Turned Into the County
Fair Fund
In making a brief report of our
recent county fair I wish to give
credit for its success to the gen
eral support of the people the
untiring and unselfish labors of a
number of the fair commission
ers many public spirited busi
ness men of Safford and other
parts of the valley the farm ad
visor the newspapers and the
invaluable assistance given by
your honorable body If I should
commence to mention individual
names of those who deserve men
tion for their good help it would
make this report too long
We were fortunately blessed
with beautiful weather There
was also the largest attendance
given any county fair in our val
ley Childrens Day the attend
ance was over four thousand by
far the largest in the history of
our county fair
and band cost us five hundred
dollars and the horse racing nine
hundred dollars The soldiers not
only furnished splendid entertain
ment but they were an educa
tional feature which will never
be forgotten by the people Many
the fair will be remembered long
er and I believe was worth more
than twice as much money could
have furnished in the way of
popular amusements
The horse racing cost consider
able but less was paid for racing
this year than at previous fairs
Those directly in charge of this
department say that it was the
best race program ever ottered
here The track was in
condition While some ot us
may be more interested in the
agricultural department it is
argued that a county fair could
not be held here without good
horse racing
The Womans and Educational
Departments and the Girls Can
ning Club work were exception
ally good but as they were shown
in a building in Safford away
from the fair grounds I fear
that only a small percentage of
the fair attendants saw these
splendid exhibits Another year
a building on the grounds should
be provided for this work
While the agricultural exhibits
the live stock and the poultry
were better than ever before
much must be done for next
years fair to make these depart
ments the main features of the
Graham County Fair The com
mission was appointed so late
this year and we depended large
serve the worK m tnis depart
ment must be followed up thru
out the entire year and arrange
ments made for selecting and
gathering the exhibits without
waiting for the people to do
this themselves Graham county
should have the best agricultural
fair in the State
Another weak leature oi our
rucont fair was the few

some attention in this respect
and several hundred citizens of
Graham county have signed a
petition asking that Safford Com
pany B First Arizona Infantry
be relieved from further border

The petition is addressed to
President Wilson and is as fol

Safford Arizona
December 2 1916
To the Honorable Woodrow
Wilson
President of the United States
White House Washington
D C
Sir We the undersigned
citizens of the Gila Valley Gra
ham County Arizonado hereby
petition the President of these
United States asking that Com
pany B of the First Arizona In
fantry be returned to their re
spective homes for the following
reasons
1 This company reported for
duty on the international border
May 10 1916 being about the
first of the guardsmen to so re
port Since this company repor
ted many other state regiments
have been sent to the border and
and mustered out Believing
that in justice to all -first come
first served the Arizona boys
who have served faithfully
should be among the first to be
benefitted from such relief from
duty
2 Many of the members of
company B were called from
various walks of life each of
which occupied positions of re
sponsibility the giving up of
not only to these but those so
situated as holding a responsible
position by virtue of having rela
tives dependent upon them has
been a hardship upon those so
depending To several members
of this company it has been nec
essary for them to abandon their
educational pursuits an exceed
ingly great sacrifice upon the
part of the member
3 Believing that Arizona has
done her share and in justice to
all concerned we ask that the
President carefully consider this
petition believing that in so do
ing he will see his way clear to
grant the request herein asked

recommended by this years fair
commission Had nothing more
been accomplished I feel that
this years work would have been
a splendid success However
now that the grounds have been
purchased and have become the
property of the county I would
strongly recommend that they
be sold or exchanged and if
possible a permanent site for
fair grounds and a public county
play grounds be secured some
where along the main road be
tween Safford and Pima Such
grounds could be used for all
public celebrations throuout the
entire year as well as the county
fair once each year The grounds
could be parked and permanently
improved and beautified and
would become a public asset and
benefit beyond price If such
grounds could include a mile

WILL REPAIR BRIDGE

Temporary Wooden Structure
to Close Gap Caused by
Walkout
Announcement that the Gila
river bridgerori the San Carlos
reservationwhich for the past
several months has been impass
able will be repaired and in
receive shape tor frame early in the
spring was made Monday after
noon by Lieut Ernest Stecker
agent for the San Carlos reserva
tion who wij have charge of the
work Ample funds for the re
pairs have bien secured and the
first work will be done in the im
mediate future
Plans for some time have been
for the construction of three ad
ditional spans to the bridge to
overlap that part of the approach
which has been washed away
For this purpose Carl Hayden
Arizonas representative in con
gress secured an appropriation
This plan has however been
abandoned temporarily
Instead ofbuilding new spans
the agent in charge plans at this
time putting in a temporary pile
bridge to connect the concrete
structure with the mainland
bridging the gap caused when
high waters took out the ap
proach It is estimated that these
repairs can -be completed for
about 3 0001 and that the work
will be completed early in the
spring
The opening of the bridge will
again make the valley road be
tween Globe Safford Clifton
Morenci and other points south
and east of this city passable
It will also open up to the public
a branch of the transcontinental
highway passing through this
district v
Lieutenant Stecker while in
Globe Monday stated that the
historic old Broncho Canyon road
through the White Mountain res
ervation has been much improved
and is now in excellent condition
