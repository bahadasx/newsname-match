By H. P. BURTON.
Chicago, Dec. 8.—I have come to
Chicago, "hog-butcher for the world,"
and dealer, too, ip vasty manner, in
wheat and corn And oats and all the
otherfeods that go to nourish the na­
tion, to find out, if possible, who it
is who is constantly putting more and
yet moae "high" in the' already too
Alpine "high cost of living."
•tuffs Aaasmblad.
Here, where the stuffs of life are
so largely assembled for distribution
throughout the land, it seems appar^
ent that, if anywhere, a finger of dis­
covery may be placed on the sources
responsible for the abnormal cost of
necessities to the ultimate consumer
—you and me and all the rest of the
lta ,000,000 Americans who are being
pinched today aB never before.
Holds Key.
That the city of Chicago does hold
the Key to this problem of what is
making the cost of living so high
seemB evidenced by the fact that it
is here the grain brokers and the
meat packers have been "investigat­
ed" time and again (yet the price of
meat and of flour were never so high
before!) and it iB here, too, that
Frank Norris gathered material for
"The Pit," his wonderful novel, show­
ing up the way board of trade gam­
blers speculate in wheat, and it is also
here that Upton Sinclair came to get
for, "The Jungle," his book on
meat packing that stirred this nation
to the deeps.
Cold Facta.
Yet here in Chicago, the distribut­
ing center of the United States, as
matter of plain, coldv fact, there is
scarcely a single.bit of ready-to-hand
information regarding- this sublet
the greatest importance to all of us.
1 have failed to find, in other words,
any official or unofficial co-ordinated
statistics or "findings" treated con­
structively so that they .have been
made to yield, ot.fven to point to the
reasons, lawful or. unlawful, sound or
unsound, for they ^.continuous and
alarming rise ip.the curve.of living
costs in the United States!
I have discovered plenty of isolated
government reports on some certain
mere "phases" of the general subject
but absolutely no def)nlte, conscious
.tracing o'f the processes of producing
any single important article of food
from start to finish, with each item
of the process systematically held up
for analysis and inspection so the
flaws, if any, may be publicly exhibit­
ed and eliminated.
That is to say, I have found that
there is not in existence today any
up-to-the-minute informative and au­
thoritative economic treatise on any
such subject, for instance, as "meat
from the manager to the platter," of
"wheat from the seed to the bun,"
although the manner in which bread
and steak are aviating as never be­
fore in history seems to be the main
topic of interest with everyone—ex­
cept officialdom!
Credits Conference.
My discovery of this lack of accu­
rate information has struck me, in­
deed, as an amazing lack in a repub­
lic responsible for the well-being of a
hundred million souls, a republic that
so preciously sees to it that you can
mail your letter for a trifling two
cents, but which doesn't care a hang
how much you pay for your bread and
vour meat—or which apparently won't
care, if its attitude is carried to the
ultimate conclusion, whether finally"
you will be able to buy bread or meat
at all or not!
Luckily, however, for us consumers,
I find that' there is an organization
which has begun to act as sort of a
foster "paternal government"' for us
in place of our present apathetic
state. This national organization is
called "The National Conference on
Marketing and Farm Credits," and
has grown out of various co-operative
producing leagues formed in several
states.
So dire does this organization vis­
ualize our national needs that they
sent out a call for the growers and
marketers of meat cattle, for the pro­
ducers of grains and milk and other
raw foods of primary importance, to
meet in a great conclave in Chicago
this week, that the problems attend­
ant upon the making efficient of these
producing and distributing processes

El Paso, Tex., Dec. 8.—Re-opening of
telegraphic communications between
Chihuahua City and the border brings
information of massacres and outrages
upon citizens of the United States and
foreigners'in.aU parts of northern Mex­
ico, according to word reaching rela­
tives in the United States.
Spares Only Own Interests.
Indications seem, according to re
porta. l^rlitnfe het^jast ,' #fek^ that
Villa's attitude toward '''Gringos" and
foreigners is changed.and,.has proved
misleading. All information now

that the bandit chief is spairing lives
only when his) own interests are at
stake. .'
It is reported that Ynea Salazar, Vil­

Mystery At Hotel
Van Horn—Big Ben
Falls Three Stories
Something must have gone decided­
ly wrong in a room on the third floor
of the new Van Horn hotel this morn­
ing to have prompted Big Ben, an
alarm agitator against sleep, owned
by Miss Cassie Brink, a clerk in the
Lucas department' store, to try and
commit suicide.
Drops Three Flights.
'Big Ben dropped from the window
of a room on the third floor of the
hostelry early today, through the plate
glass canopy in front of ^he hotel,
and escaped without a scratch. As
for the canopy, one of the plate glass­
es was smashed. It was a narrow es­
cape for Big Fen, but he's up and
working again this afternoon and will­
ing to forgive all.
Air of Mystery About It
There's an air of mystery about the
affair, as to.what prompted Big Ben
to take the three-story leap through
space. No one seems to know. A ru­
mor. however, has it that Big Een's
owner is enthused with her bed at
the hotel and would like to have slept
all morning, but "a certain little thing
happened."
Beh Got "Shooting Off."
It is believed that Big "Ben got
"shooting off," and that his owner
jumped from her bed, seized the agi­
tator by the neck and hoisted him
out of the window. Ben's flight
through space then began. He made
quick time, struck the canopy, went
right through it and fell on the ce­
ment sidewalk.
Still Talking When Found.
Clerks and others rushed out of the
hostelry. Big Ben kept right on talk­
ing to himself. The owner evidently
had her sleep out.

Justice-Elect Derides and Defies
Provisional Body in Long
Tirade
'FOOL" AND "CROOK"
TERMS EXCHANGED
Dijgnity Thrown to Winds in
Heated Discussion—De
cision Deferred
Denunciation defiance, derision and
disdain were rained on the heads of
District Judges Pollock, Nuessle,
Crawford and Leighton, sitting as the
supreme court of North Dakota, and
retiring Justices Fisk, Burke and Goss
for the spice of an hqur yesterday af­
ternoon by Justice-elect Robinson.
The scene enacted in the house
chamber at the capitol in the presence
of a hundred or more spectators, was
one probably without parallel in the
history of civilized -government. The
spectacle was that-of three supreme
courts on trial -of a supposedly -con­
stitutionally composed chief tribunal
set at defiance and bridled by citizens
who had appeared at the. bar. In re­
sponse to the orders of this court.
Court Can do Nothing.
"The present court can do noljhing
that wil.1 not be subject to review by
the three justices who have Organized
as the supreme court," declared Jus
tice-elect Robinson, after denying any
jurisdiction upon the part of the pro
viisonal court.
"As the supreme court of this state
w'e have jurisdiction over all inferior
courts. We have warned you—if you
insist on doing what you propose to
do, let the peril be on your heads.
Judges Disqualified.
"I had thought of filing affidavits
showing why two or more of the judg­
es here present should not serve in
this matter, but my associates prefer­
red to rest everything on the question
of jurisdiction.
"I and my associates were elected
justice of the supreme court by major­
ities of 18,000 to 24,000. Our right to
h'old office'should not be subject to a
contest. If I had been in the place of
these ek-judgeB I would rtever have
served pile day after that, election. But
they am infatuated with office—they
hold on with a grip like death.
Might Glv# Advice.
"I deem it right find proper, gentle
men, that you should consider thiB
case to the extent of giving advice and
counsel, and, perhaps, extend sym­
pathy and condolences to the defeated
candidates.
Have Certificates.
"The three justices who now de­
mand their seats on the supreme
bench have certificates of election dat­
ing from the first Monday in Decern
ber, 1916. The certificates of election
of Judges Goss, Burke and Fisk read
to hold office from the first Monday in
December, 1910. If Judge Goss has
allowed someone else to draw a
month's salary for him, that is his
fault. To say that he did not take of­
fice the first Monday in December,
1910, because the secretary of state
or someone else told him not to is a
silly plea. If I were to go into a con
test in this matter and chose to recog
nize your authority, I would prove all
these facts by the secreary of state."
"Picked Their Friends."
After again taunting the retiring jus
tices with their recent defeat, Justice
elect Robinson proceeded:
"They have called on and picked
you, gentlemen, as the most likely
men to decide the case in favor of the
ex-judges: They have called you to de­
cide in their favor, as the special
friends of the three judges."
Leighton Takes Exception.
Here Judge Leighton of Minot took
strenuOus exceptions to the manner in
which Robinson was addressing the
court. The latter replied that they were
there not as members of a court but
as fellow-citizens. Judge Pollock, act­
ing as chief justice, insisted that Rob­
inson stick to his case, and the court
passed to the next respondent.
Grace States Stand.
Justice-elect Grace stated he could
not recognize the jurisdiction of the
court .for the resaon that the constitu­
tion provides the district' judges called
in should be disinterested and'should
be summoned by disinherited parties.
In.the present instance, he contended,
none of the justices ^ere disinterest­
ed, and none had any right to compose
a coiirt.
"I truly believe," concluded Grace,
"that you are without jurisdiction and
that any settlement of this question
by you will not be a final settlement
but must recur again and again."
"Do you contend that no tribunal is
provided by the constitution for a case
such as this?" asked acting Chief Jus­
tice Pollock.
"I qontend," replied Grace, "that the
justices who called you in were inter­
ested and that, therefore, you are dis
quMfied."
All Interested.
William Lemke, attorney for the jus­
tices-elect, on the question of jurisdic­
tion said:
"Judges Bruce and Christianson are
just as much interested as the retiring
judges. Whatever may be done by
any judges purporting to represent the
supreme court from this time on will
not necediarily tend to have any
weight with the incoming justices."
Retiring Justices Speak.
Retiring Justices Goss, Burke and
Fisk spoke in defense of their claim
that the terms of supreme court jus­
tices shall begin the first Monday in

STEPS FOR COST
SYSTEI Mil
BY GRAIN MEN
Chicago, Dec. 8.—'Farmers of the
great grain states of the middle west
and north, believing that less than a
fair share of the profits of their labor
is returned to them, took the first
steps .here today to establish a cost
system for their industry.
In connection with the national con­
ference on marketing and farm credits,
represetqative grain growers discus­
sed various means of detemining mar­
keting costs from the field, through
the elevators, the mills and to the
housewife's oven with the ultimate ob­
ject of lessening the cost to the con­
sumer and attracting a larger portion
of what the consumer pays, direct to
the producer.
Lynn J. Frazier, governor-elect of
North Dakota, who arrived at the head
of a delegation of North Dakotans in
two special trains from the northwest,
was the chief speaker, telling of the
handicaps that, have hindered the ship-'
pers of his state and toward the re
inoval of which the state adminstra
tion is pledged to work.

HERCULEAN TASK BEFORE
HIM TO FORM MINISTRY
London, Dec. 8.—Lloyd-George
seems to be solidifying political fac­
tions in his attempt to form a new
ministry that will give closer and
more efficient control over war plans.
At a meeting today of the liberal
party members, resolutions were
adopted expressing confidence in their
leaders and former Minister Herbert
Asquith. The members also express­
ed their determination to support the
new Lloyd-George government in the
prosecution of the war.
It is agreed everywhere that the
little Welshman is facing a herculean
task. The formation of the new min
istry must typify England's determi­
nation to wage the war to the bitter
end.
Good Material.
Lloyd-George has plenty of excel
lent material from which to draw bis
cabinet. Among th^ names which
were most prominently mentioned to­
day as possible ministers were:
L'onar i^l, unionist Lord Curzon,
rniwifst^'the Earl of Derby, Union­
ist Lord Milner, Unionist Winston
Churchill, Liberal Lord Robert Cecil,
blockade minister in the late cabinet,
Unionist Arthur -Henderson, minister
of pensions in the late cabinet, La
borite Lord Davenport. Unionist Sir
Henry Dalziel. Liberal, and Lord
Reading, Liberal.
The present complexion of the
house is: Unionist 2:J,7. Liberal 260,
Labor °7. Irish Nationalist 75, O'Bri
enites 3, Independents 2. It is believ­
ed the new cabinet maker will event­
ually be able to enlist the support of
the labor party, in view of his known
purpose more liberally to recognize
that party's claims in the new minis­
try. Only one member, Arthur Hen­
derson, member of pensions, wag on
the Asquith coalition cabinet. The
Labor party has heretofore fteen very
antagonistic to Lloyd-George.

ing of the French battleship Suf

$6,000,000 and was authorized July ,•

London, Dec. 8.—German troops
along the whole Monastir front are be*
ing strongly reinforced. Presumably
the'se forces are being diverted from
tbe Rumanian theater. It is believed
here that this Germans are preparing
for an Immense offensive against the
Frank-Serbian-Itallan-British forces in
Macedonia.
The Bulgarian forces are being
heavily re-inforced by German troops
no longer needed in the conquering of
Rumania.
Official dispatches from the Mace­
donian front declare that all enemy at­
tacks have been repulsed. In Dobrad*
ja, on the Bulgarian left front, .the, en*
emy is slowly entrenching.
Paris reports state that that Ser­
bians and allied forces repulsed three
Bulgarian attacks.
London's Report.
London dispatches state that the
Rumanian retirement before the Teu­

teritory by the defenders was at a ter­

8,000 men and 16 cannon.
Have 'Principal Cities.
Not only is Bucharest, but most of
the important Ijtumanjap commercial
towns are now junder control-of
Germany.
A United Press correspondent ac*
pompanying Falkenhayn's army draws
this graphic word picture of the re*
treat of the Rumanians:
Military Governor. ,-r'
It is to bring order out of thls chaosl
that Gen. von Tulff, former military
administrator of Poland, before War*
saw's fall, has been named German
governor-general of Rumania. He is.
now enroute here with two generate
and an entire staff.
Rumanians Plunder.
The Rumanians ordered from their
homes by their government, clogged
the roads, most of them with a few be*
longings packed on small oxen carta.
The advancing Germans overtook
these refugees. Then they turned
back toward their homes only to Had
in thousands of instances that every­
thing they had left behind had been
plundered by other Rumanians. As
we rode through Rammicu and Walk la
the wildest anarchy prevailed. The
streets were littered with household
goods, papers, window curtains, dead
horses and dogs. Meanwhile bands of
Rumanian gypsies went from house to
house apd shop to shop, smashing win­
dows and again plundering the homes
already half destroyed. These plan*
dering bands—men, women and child*
ren—piled what they could not carry
on their own backs on stolen horses
or cows. It was the same sight we
encountered in scores of other Ruman­
ian villages.
Stealing Cattle.
Meanwhile the fleeing families are
returning and enroute they are steal­
ing cattle liberated at the first word
of the German advance. Because of
deprivations and the roaming of. the
muddy, cold Rumanian roads, the mor­
tality of Children among these miser*
able refugees has been very high. In
Alexandria, the plundering reached
such a height that a few educated fam­
ilies, which. remained behind formed
a civilian force to protect their prop­
erty. These are few of the conditions
which face the new governor-general
von Tulff: Not only will he seek to
restore order, but it is also his task to
organize the forwarding to Germany
of the vast surplus stores of grain,
cattle and petroleum which have tyU*
en into the invaders' hands. Alexin*
dria alone possesses $1,000,000 worth
of stores. Other cities are almost
equally well stocked. Wallachia it*
self is a food paradise.
Bridges Destroyed.
Because the Rumanians destroyed
many of the railway bridges the entire
German campaign in Rumania was by
wagons over the ordinary highways.
One sees thousands of columns of
these with ammunition, fodf, weap­
ons and military supplies.
Although the Germans have had con­
trol of Western Rumania only a few
days laborers are already clearing the
railways and assembling freight cars,
engines and materials which the flee­
ing Rumanians left.
I saw whole stretches over which
trains were in operation and while at
Gen. von Krafft's headquarters I met
a German major assigned to take
charge of the Rumanian transporta­
tion system. One ironical incident
connected with the railway situation
was that we met two engneera in Car
acalu and Alexandria, who had been
sent to those two citics by the Bu-
