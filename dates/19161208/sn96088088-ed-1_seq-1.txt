Mr. Shipley is undecided as to what
disposition he will make of the valued
implement. He says the Smithsonian
Institute has informed him that there
are people in the United States who
would gladly travel across the conti
nent to gain possession of the spear
head. He has, accordingly, deposited
it in the vault of one of the Sheridan
banks.
The spearhead itself is pear-shaped,
measures one and a half inches in
width and is five inches long; its
shaft is about the size of a lead pen
cil and is five inches in length.
Tempered copper represents one of
the lost arts, 'hence the interest evinc
ed by scientists in the spearhead.

Four instead of two nights in the
armory each week will be used by the
Dallas Gymnasium association. This
was decided at the meeting of the
asosciation in the library building
Monday night and the request of the
asosciation for two additional nights
was granted Tuesday evening by the
members of company L. The schedule
now will be: Monday and Friday
nights, gym class; Wednesday and
Thursday nights, basketball practice.
Membership in the gymnasium as
sociation is still open to men.. Ap
plication should be made at Fuller s
Pharmacy or Stafrin 's drug store. It
is thought between 40 and 50 men
will be present Wednesday night, De
cember 13, for the first class. Lieu
tenant Compton, Physical Director
Gingrich of the Salem Y. M. C. A.,
and a pianist will be here to conduct
the class, which starts at 7:30.
Conrad Stafrin is secretary-treas
urer of the association and the dues
of $5 for the first six months should
be paid to him before six o'clock of
Wednesday, December 13. As treasur
er Captain Stafrin has no time to
solicit payment of the dues and it is
not thought members will cause any
delay in paying bills because of slow
ness to fulfill their obligations. All
money received over $150, the rent
of the armory for six months, will
be used to purchase equipment. A
committee of the business men, in
conjunction with Captain Stafrin, will
expend the money. It is proposed to
provide more showers, build more
lockers and install gymnasium equip
ment. The gymnasium association
and Company L Athletie club will
work in co-operation.

"Attention, company." The "com
pany" was Marshal Oliver Chase and
myself. Corporal Alvin Robb was in
"command." And then Robb put us
through our first real lesson. Most
of it is still hazy to me.
I ought to tell, first, about how
looked, A week ago Quartermaster
bergeant Bill Himes fitted me out.
He gave me the largest hat the gov
ernment had sent; it was too small
for me. I believe the leggings are
little too small. However, I'll see
Bill about that. Trousers fit splen
didly; the blouse, the minimum size,
is too wg. But I'll use paper or
something else to fill it out. I thought,
even with the above handicaps, that
I looked good. The former "regu
lar" laughed in my face. '-h
"Hurry, Dinneen," Cheney (I fir
get "he is Lieutenant Chenoweth in
the militia) said to me. I was go
ing just as fast as I could. But t
every step a new dilemma came. '4l
couldn't get the guns out of the rac.
Robb said, "Hurry, Dinneen," bujt
I thought he was trying to mix me a
little more. I
Quite unmilitary, I answered, "J
guess they don't want us in there,!'
I pointed to the main drill floor
where the men were being sent
through by Lieutenant Chenoweth. I
saw Chase leaning against the door
sill and I thought they weren't ready
for the rookies yet. Captain Stafnn
came to the rescue: "Corporal Robb
will take you in charge." He did.
They laughed at me as I carried my
gun to the end of the drill floor. I
knew I wasn't holding it rightly.
They, didn't have to laugh. Maybe
they were laughing at Oliver 1 who
along at my-heels I hope theyl
were.
Now Robb hasn't a very big voice;
Cheney has. The company was mak
ing a lot Of noise; Robb was doing
his best ; my mind was confused. Now
I remember something about "grasp
ing the piece at the balance." I m
sure that was said quite a few times.
Robb has patience, I do believe. But
he did lead ns a strenuous chase. It
was rort arms," "Kight arms.
'Forward March," "company, halt"
and so on. Robb (I must say Corpor
al Kobb) would give ns the same
command several times. I would de
cide that I bad it and then he would
change. I wouldn't get the change
until I saw the smile on his face. I
hit my hat an even hundred time in
throwing my gnn to and from my
shoulder. My shoulder is a little sore
now.
But it was fun. Sometimes Cor
poral Robb (I said it that time) would
'pick on" Chase for awhile. My, I
was nappy then. 1 figured out just
how much better a soldier I was than
Chase and then it would be my turn.
forgot all my "triumphs" in a
minute. I like Cheney. He didn t
come around and watch. Captain
Stafrin did. Lieutenant Piasecki did,
too, but he didn't let me see him
He told me about it afterwards.
No, I'm not going to tell you what
lieutenant Piasecki said about mv
'rookiness."

Regains Thunder But Not Light
A couple of weeks ago someone
took a revolver and electric flsb
lieht from a pocket in Walter L.
Toole's automobile. The revolver was
turned into Sheriff Orr's office and
has been returned to Walter, but the
'-'ertrie flashlight is still missing.
A good-sized crowd of Dallas peo
ple were well repaid for turning out
to the high school auditdnum on
Wednesday night when 150 colored
views of Oregon forests, forest fires
and forest protection work were
shown under the auspices of the Polk
County Fire Protective association.
The pictures, which are the property
of the state board of forestry, were
shown by State Forester F. A. Elliott
and his assistant, 0. E. Siecke, of
Salem, and a lecture in connection
with their showing was given by W.
V. Fuller, district warden, and head
of the Polk county patrol. The views
were some of the finest ever shown
in Dallas, and there was considerable
favorable comment passed on them by
an interested audience. The lecture
was given as part of the educotional
policy of the association for the pre
vention of forest fires.
Among some facts given in connec
tion with the pictures by Mr. Fuller
were the following. Oregon has twice
the timber of all New England, New
York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wis
consin and Minnesota combined.
has twice the timber of the central
hard woods region, extending from
southern Michigan to Southern Ten
nesee and as much timber as all of
the United States east of the Rocky
mountains and north of the southern
pine belt. It has one-sixth of the
stumpage of the entire United States,
or 430 billion feet, which has a stand.
ing value of $680,000,000. When man
ufactured the timber of Oregon will
be worth $6,800,000,000,
"Oregon's lumber industry is only
in its infancy," stated Mr. Fuller,
"yet it employs 18,000 men, or one
half of those engaged in manufactur-
iflg"1wdoiitries--4a--the-; statei-If Hie
timber of Oregon was all manufactur
ed at once and loaded onto cars-for
shipment it would make a train reach
ing seven times around the world.
From this industry $70,000 of outside
money comes into the state daily, for
80 per cent of all outgoing freight is
lumber. 4,000,000 acres, containing
about 150 billion feet has been de
stroyed by fire, or about one-third
the present stand."
To show the work being accom
plished by the Fire Patrol and fire
prevention associations, Mr. Fuller
said that in 1910 fire destroyed $1
640,997 worth of timber and other
property. In 1911 the present code
of forestry laws was enacted. This
code, added to in 1913, provides a
compulsory Are patrol law. Since
1911 the total fire loss in five years
has been less than $100,000, or one
sixteenth the loss in the single season,
1910. The situation is aptly describ
ed by one of the association's secre
taries, who, in his annual report, says :
"It is not alone the amount of money
expended by the association that is
responsible for the fact that we have
suffered no loss by fire, but great
credit mast be given to the state for
ester for the wise educational policy
promulgated by his office. The re
sult of this wise policy has been that,
whereas in former years people who
had occasion to go into the woods
either for business or pleasure were
generally very careless with fire, camp
fires were left burning, logging en
gines and locomotives were continual
ly setting out fires, and most people
looked upon forest fires as a necessary
evil. Now, almost without exception,
everybody is careful with fire and tbe
result is that this hazard has been
reduced to a minimum."
Mr. Fuller also explained that the
fire patrol law made it imperative for
all timber owners to either patrol or
have patrol ed their holdings. This
has brought a condition that works
out admirably. For instance in Polk
eounty tbe federal government pays
meet of the wsges of two patrolmen,
the state pays most of the salary of
tbe district warden, and the remain
der of tbe expense of tbe work is
borne by tbe Polk County Fire Pa
trol association. In tbe past season
there were in the state 27 district
wardens, who hr working under
them 333 patrolmec jd in addition
directed the work of 51 patrolmen

BY MANY ABSENCES.
Classes To Resume December 18 When
When It Is Hoped Disease Epi
demic Will Be Over.
Dallas grammar schools, up to the
8B class, were closed yesterday
morning for a period of ten days. Ab
sences of pupils because of measles,
whooping cough and colds cut attend
ance one-fourth to one-half and the
work of the classes had been greatly
hampered. The school board decided
Wednesday evening that it would be
best to close the schools for a time.
During the vacation the teachers will
visit grade schools in other places.
That the action has been consider
ed for several days was indicated yes
terday by Dr. B. H. McCallon, chair
man of the school board. Dr. McCal'
Ion said that "the directors became
unanimous Wednesday night that the
schools should be closed."
It was a jolly crowd of children
yesterday morning that was turned
away from the schools' doors. Not
any of the regret of the teachers and
board members was shown by them.

Another route for the West Side
Pacific highway between Indepen
dence and Corvallis is proposed. Field
work on the projected road has just
been completed by H. N. Hackett, as
sistant to the state engineer. Accord
ing to reports the location saves about
two miles and eliminates three xail-
iroad crossings It is to cross the
Luckiamute river in Polk county on
a proposed bridge near Parker. The
road is laid out in an approximately
straight line.
The field work for the road cost $42
per mile and im-Judcs all data ready
for letting of contracts. Computa
tions are now under way by the state
engineer's office to balance cuts and
fills, after which plans and specifica
tions will be prepared. The work is
said to be financed by the state in
connection with Benton county, al
though it is not stated as to where
funds will eome for the new bridge
across the Luckiamute. . The object
of citizens urging this route is to se
cure necessary right-of-way and be
ready with plans, so that financial aid
can be enlisted from some source for
the improvement of the highway.
According to the state engineers of
fice a new system has been used in
making this survey. It is known as
the base line method which was de
veloped by the New York state high
way department. This system of lo
cating roads will be used by the Ore
gon highway department in the future
as it is more economical than the old
railway inethod of making both a pre
liminary and a final location survey
before contracts can be let.
The state engineer has not confined '
surveys for the west side highway to
the new location, for several surveys
have been made, it is said, on the old
road which runs south from Indepen
dence to tbe east of the Espee tracks.
There is some rumor that this will be
the adopted route, after considerable
straightening out, and that pavement
of this road is to start with the open
ing of good weather in the spring.
The county commissioners have evi
dently taken for granted, however,
that the new road, west of tbe track,
is to be built for they have called for
sealed bids for fencing the state high
way south of Independence. The bids
are to state the price per rod of fenc
ing and will be opened on Thursday,
December 28th. The plans call for a
fence for a distance of 7Vi miles
south of Independence to tbe J. J.
Thurston place.. Five miles of this
stretch is along the Espee right of
way, where it is intended to build but
one fence and making use of the
railroad fence on the east side of tbe
road. The remaining 2Va miles calls
for double fencing.
Decides la Favor of Swenson.
Judge Belt yesterday decided the
case of the Southern Pacific railroad
company, appellant, vs. Swanson, re
spondent, involving liability for stock
killed on the railroad company's prop
erty, released by the railroad com
mission from compliance with tbe leg
islative providing for the fencing of
land along the right of way, in. Swan
son's favor. The judge held that the
release by tbe railroad commission
frnm esrninlvinir with the reouirements
of the law did not release the com
pany from the responsibility of pay
ment for livestock killed upon the
right of way, as provided in the legis
lative act of 1887. Inasmuch as Cir
suit Jndge Bagley of tbe state of
Washington has held to the contrary
it is believed that the ease will be ap
pealed to the supreme court
