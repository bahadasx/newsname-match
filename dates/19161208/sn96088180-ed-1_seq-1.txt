Washington, Dec. 8, After coo
aidaratlon of the flrian explana
tloM In the Arabia case, President
Wilson today Instructed Secretary
Lansing to forward an outline of the
reply to England, with the request
that any faoti the British govern
meat might have ai to the ttatni of
the nhlp when ahe waa iimk would
be welcome to this government.
On the results of Inquiries by
agents or thla government and. on
what facta England may be able to
ahow therefor, will depend thli gov
ernment'a formal opinion on the Ara
bia attack. The action taken today.
It waa explained, wilt necessarily de
lay for several daya at least, any
chance of final decision In the mat
ter. The Arabia case was to be
thoroughly discussed at thla after
oon'e cabinet mooting. America-
poller toward the Cktrmaa submar
ine situation . remain warily what
It waa when this government told
'Oermaay mrmiuK rwbire
-methods of torpedoing, This, wss
stated officially today, but there waa
reason, to believe that the United
Stated bad Dot unalterably put up
the gates at laaat to brief discussion
f aertoua eubmarlnt .problems now
Wore the administration.
Taken at Its face the American
government stands pat on ber at
titude expressed la the Sussex Bote,
which means It would break diplc--matlo
relations if Germany trans
gressed. There Is growing belief that
In the Arabia cm at least, and, per
liaps, Is the Marina, Germany bad
overstepped America's mandate.
But In line with a policy of avert
ing anything that might ultimately
lead to war, the administration Is re
garded as Mkely. to steer clear ot a
break-up to the last possible point.
Briefly, Oermany admits her com
mander built up a structure of pre
sumption that the Arabia waa a
transport, and hence warlike, and
'then proceeded to sink her. The
other aide ot the picture Ilea In the
American memorandum of March IS.
"While that applied to armed mer
chantmen and armament does not

It laid down the principle: '
"The determination or warlike
character must rest In no case upon
presumption, but upon conclusive
evidence, because the responsibility
