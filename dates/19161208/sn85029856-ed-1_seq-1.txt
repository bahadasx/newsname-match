A BAD PRAIRIE FIRE
"Fire starting near the Holland
'Bros, pasture laBt Sunday burned
over about ten thousand acres of
land, most of which was valuable
pasture. Several miles of fence was
also burned and also destroyed.- The
ftre 'began about ten o'clock in the
tornenoon and was checked about
five in the evening. Many acres of
- tried and grain in the fields would
,Tave burned had it not been for the
people In the community fighting the
- ffire as best they could.
Every one 4n the county should,
remember the dangerous fires last
spring and the great loss of property
and the almost fatal injuries received
, by several persons. This should have
been a lesson to, all people .who read
. of it in the papers. It seems that
' 'the law should 'be amended to make
it a criminal offense for any person
in' any manner to set fires los the
country except with the consent of
some legally constituted body acting
m I fire marshal and under certain
directions and restrictions. In most
. cases those setting out the fires are
not responsible financially for the
damages that are done and therefore
' the farmer who suffers the great
. losses is without any remedy.
The-wanton and willful setting out
of (fires in the country In fields and
pastures has been for several years
denounced as a crime under the laws
of this state'. This law has not been
strictly enforced in the past but the
county attorney says he intends to
1 make a thorough Investigation of all
fires In the future. He has under In
vestigation now the 'fire which was
started in the Holland pasture about
twelve miles north and two miles
west of Liberal last Sunday, He has
summoned two boys of about the age
of sixteen whose names have been
given to ' htm as being the persons
.who set the fire. In case the evidence
justifies, the county attorney asserts,
"he Intends to make- arrests of . the
guilty parties! the law. It is found,
'is not broad enough to cover all cases
of fires. ,
.It is understood that the boys who
set out the fire last Sunday were
playing with matqb.es 'and when the
'fire was started made little or no ef
fort to fight it or try to put it out.
The two boys' names for the present
- will be withheld as this is the wish of
' County Attorney Commons, for It has
not been conclusively proven as yet
under what circumstances the fire
was set. .
ROAD MEETING POSTPONED
The road meeting which was to
have been held at the Wideawake
poned until Wednesday evening, De
cember 13th. The farmers of that
vicinity have shown a considerable
'amount of interest regarding the

THE WORLD OF THE FUTURE .
IN THE last few years I have developed a religious
belief that has now become to me as real as any com
monplace fact : I think that mankind is still, as it were,
collectively dreaming and hardly more awakened to re
ality than a very young child. It has these dreams that
we express by the flags of nationalities and by strange
loyalties, and by irrational creeds and ceremonies ; and
its dreams at times become such nightmares -as this
war. But the time draws near when mankind will
awake and the dreams wilt fade away ; and then there
will be no nationality in all the world but humanity, and
no king, no emperor; no leader but the one God of man
kind. This is my faith. I am as certain of this as I was
in 1900 that men would presently fly. To me it is as it
must be so. H. G. Wells in The Saturday Evening Post.

WORKING ON THE ROADS
The work is progressing very rap
idly on the road running east from
Liberal to the Bluebell district. When
this Job is finished there will be SO
miles of good bard road in that di
rection and it Is hoped that before
spring there will be several more
miles. The Chamber of Commerce is
raising a great deal of enthusiasm in
the road work and the farmers are
responding loyally. There are about
20 wagons and teams hauling the
gyp onto the road at present and the
teams have been furnished by the
farmers and the men by the Cham
ber of Commerce. The gyp road is
nearly as hard as pavement and al
though it necessitates a certain
amount of upkeep, it 1 will last In
definitely. 'TUe men who have this

ORGANIZED A "MOOSEHEART
LEGION"
Gerald F. Gahan, national director
of the Loyal Order of Moose, was la
Liberal the last of the week In the
Interest of that order. He gave an
llustrated lecture to the members of
! the lodge at a meeting Friday nighty
which was greatly" enjoyed by all the
boys. Mr. Gahan made arrangements
while here to organize a ''Mooseheart
Legion," the highest degree obtain
able In the order of Moose. Only
thee of these Legions can be located
in this state, and Hutchinson and
Dodge City have been exerting every
effort to land it for their cities. How
ever, Mr. Gahan was so well im
pressed with Liberal and its outlook
for the .future, and so pleased with
the efforts of the local members to
build up a strong lodge that he will
recommend Liberal as the logical
place for its establishment. This
will mean a big thing for Liberal, as
every Moose wanting to take the
highest degree of the order will have
to come to Liberal or go to Topeka
to get It, Topeka 'being the only town
In the state having such an organ
ization at this time. It has been our
observation that whatever the Moose
go after they generally brlnghome.
RAISES COYOTE IMK3S
C. T. Dykes, a farmer living 10
miles northwest of town, engages in
a novel line of business in addition to
his regular farming. He makes a
specialty ot raising coyote hounds
and has no trouble getting rid of the
pups at right around the $50 mark
each. He took some of'hls dogs over
to Johnson county the last of the
week and took part in a county
wide coyote hunt with the natives
of that county. Only eight of the
brutes were captured In--the whole
drive, notwithstanding that dogs and
men were present from all parts of
the state. Mr. Dykes has. frequently
gpns.out on a coyote-hunt by him-...
self and a couple ot dogs and' brought
home three coyotes to show for his
day's work, which would seem to In
dicate the Johnson county affair a
decided frost. The county pays $1.00
per head for coyotes and the furs
bring about $3.00 each when shipped
to the city, which makes it worth
while to fool with it a fellow gets at
least one per day.
A message was received this moru
by Dr. Nichols announcing the death
ot L. F. Clark ot Manhattan, Kan
sas. Mr. Clark Is the father of
Mrs. R. T. Nichols and a brother
of J. G. Ault. He lived here a cou
ple of years ago, residing on a farm
a couple of miles west ot Liberal. Mr.
Clark was 60 years of age and leaves
a wife and two sons to mourn his
death. He was a representative cit
izen and oue whose death will be re;
gretted by all who know him and par;
tlcularly so to a number ot old ac
quaintances in Liberal and vicinity.
Funeral -services will likely be held
Saturday. Mrs. Nichols left for Man
hattan this morning and Mr. and Mrs.
J. G- Ault will leave tomorrow.
