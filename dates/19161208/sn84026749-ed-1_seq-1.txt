Up His Bill.
HUGHES RALLIES FORCES
Demands Measure Be Read,
While Hurried Call Goes Out
for Opponents.
The battlo over prohibition for tha
District off Columbia began suddenly
In tho Senate this afternoon
Senator Shepparu of Texas moved to
tako up his bill providing for prohibi
tion In tho District Immediately after
the morning business was concluded.
On a viva oce vote with only a few
scattering noes, the Senate adopted the
motion to proceed with tho considera
tion of the measure
Senator Hughes of New Jersey, an
opponent of tha bill. Insisted tliat It be
read - in full when Senator Sheppanl
asked that tho reading be dispensed
with. The bill Is a long one and read
ing of It by the clerk took up consider
able tlmo.
Opponents ItaNy.
Opponents of the bill wero thus given
an opportunity to rally their . forces.
They had been taken by surprise by
tho Sheppard motion and were not ex
pecting It at this time.
While the bill was being read. Sen
iors Stone. James. Usnkhead., and
other leaders opposed to prohibition
conferred.
After the read ng of the b 111 whlrli
consumed nearly half an hour, Sen
ator nneppard asgea tnat various
amendments he considered.
Permits Personal Use.
He explained that tha original b III
had prohibited the personal use of
liquor as well as Its manufacture and
sale. The purpose of tha amendments,
he said. Is to eliminate the personal
use feature, and to make the measure
apply only to the manufacture and
sale of lluuor. Further than this he
said the amendments were Intend!
to ntrengtnen ine inn.
wnen nrst introduced, me aatn
when the bill should b vtTsctlve was
November 1, 191. This was changed
by a
117.
n amendment to Navcmber I,
rienator Clark or Wyoming, senator
Underwood, and others Questioned
Senator Sheppard about the meaning
of various amendments.
Advocates of the bill did not wastn
any tlmo In general discussion. Such
discussion as there was related to
different amendments.
Question of Penalties.
Much talk waa stirred up over the
question of minimum penalties. Sena
tor Shafroth, of Colorado, offered an
amendment which waa accepted by
Senator Sheppard rtrlklng out the
minimum flue of $.100 In the penalty
provision relating to the sale of
liquors. He later withdrew the
amendment, but followed It up by
attempting to get various other mini
mum penalties eliminated from the
bill.
He offered an amendment striking out
the minimum penalty of Imprisonment
for thirty days for violation of the sec
tion relating to obtaining of liquors for
medicinal purposes.
This amendment would have left the
Imprisonment penalty simply the maxi
mum of six months and thus would
leave It to the discretion of the court
to fix the minimum. After this Sena
tor Shafroth attempted to eliminate
various other minimum penalties.
Vardaman Opposes Change.
Senator Vardaman of Mississippi
strqnsly urged that the minimum penal
ties be retained In the bill.
Senator Shafroth took tho position
that It was In the Interest of enforce
ment of the law to leavailt to the dis
cretion of the court as to how light a
penalty should be Imposed.
Senators Curtis and Norrln both
strongly opposed cutting out tho
minimum penalties. Senator Curtis
said that In Kansas for many year
the Imprisonment penalty had not
been less than thirty days, and It had
.not Interfered with the enforcement
of the law,
"If a man Is convicted of a crime
of this kind," said Senator Curtis,
"and let off with a light sentence, lie
repeats the offense as often an he Is
sentenced."
Senator Shafroth' proposal was
finally voted down.
The debate for today ended at 2
oTclock. when the Owen corrupt prac
tices bill, which had the right of way,
automatically came up.
Stormy Career of 1)111.
The Sheppard bill, for an abso
lutely dry District, has had a stormy
career In the present Congress. It
was Introduced by the Texas Senator
early In the last session, and many ef
forts were made to pass It, but parlia
mentarians kept It from a record vote.
The bill Is exceedingly broad In its
provisions. It prohibits the manufac
ture, sale, offering for sale, or holding
of any spirituous or alcoholic llnuorn
In the Dlsti-lct, under sevoti penalties.
The bill has been much. amended In
the Senate, and now exempts liquors
for scientific, medicinal, pharmaceuti
cal, mechanical, and sacramental pur
poses. Killed on Technicalities.
Several times It has been tacked
on the District bill In the Senato as
an amendment, but each (line It has
gone off on a point of order.
It was brought up today as a sepa
rate bill, and Is not subject to any
such parliamentary move.
Senator Sheppard and those who
favor a dry District declare that they
have the votes to pass the bill If it
can be brought to ballot.
Several times during the last ses
sion the . Sheppard measure was
brought on the Moor, as It wus today,
hut each time the regular, order of
business or other contingency Inter
rupted consideration,
