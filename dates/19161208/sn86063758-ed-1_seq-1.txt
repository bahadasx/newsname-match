member of the Daughters of the a
V- American Revolution to attend a meet- fi
ins- r>f the uarent teachers associa- v
tion of the school to be held at the r
liigh schools building on Wednesday s
afternoon. I accepted and I was> h
there. This member said they were ;i
going to discuss the plan of retain- t.
ing and Using the old court house t'
for a community building and would h
be glad for me to say something at- h
ler Mr. M. L. Spearman read a paper f
on the subject. And of course after n
Dr. Kinard finish.^ his talk 011 com tl
pulsory education. n
There was a good attendance ox ?
mother parents and a few oi' the fat'k-, *
er parents. Dr. Kinard discussed ^
compulsory education and gave the ^
statistics of the States that now have s
compulsory attendance and said that 1
now there were only six States that
did not have some sort of compulsory p
attendance law and that last year 15
Parnlino ;?rlnnt in ?* a TrvhrSfl ^

(he did not say that but I do) law 1
on the subject there were only five ^
that had no such law. He gave \
the usual arguments against sucj *
a law and then answered the ob-i
jections in the usual way. I thinK s
the South Carolina law is a reductio ^
ad absurdum, or if that is not the ^
proper Latin, is a reduction to ab- a]
surdity of the idea of local option. w
And in practical effect it is in fact
no law* .at all. I believe tlfct theue CJ
are several districts in New,berry that j ^
Tiave voted compulsory attendance andi
by this time no one m tne oisinci -
knows anything about it and there is ?
no difference in the results. I intro-! ^
duced a bill in the legislature for a jt0
State law some fourteen years ago;
and Mr. Raysor of Orangeburg haa j ^
a companion bill in the senate. The j si
bill passed the senate and wanted only! w
six votes of passing the house. I tc
fcave long been in favor of a compui-; n<
sory attendance law and a few years to
ago collected a digest of the com-; P'
pulsory laws of all the States in the i **
union. I believe, as Dr. Kinard stated.! w
that the child has rights that the e*
parents must respect, and one ot a<
ji these is to have the very best oppor- '?-*
tunity possible to make a good citl-, ^
zen and one of these opportunities is' *s
to have the best training possible. |vt
and if the parents neglect to give this j
opportunity then the State has a right
to step in and say you shall. But cs
this thing that the legislature of 1915 P1
passed is a farce of the first water.

As to the negro we need have no

$r. Kicard said that there were
three suggestions as the solution or ei
the negro problem. One to colonize
him which was impracticable, th?
other one assimilation, and the other, te
segregation. He seemed to favor thej
idea of segregation. Colonization is (
Impractical. Assimilation Is repug
nant but I saw it stated somewhere
that Cvery day in the city of New
York an average of six licenses is is
sued for the intermarriage between
k c

Is a small matter, bnt it is at least
a sympton. As to segregation I do
not know about it. I doubt if it is
practical. You know Thos. Jeffers?i
I
tfc
w
ar
said in 1822, I think it was, that noth-! R
ing was more certainly written In
.the book of fate than that these peo
ple. the negroes, would be free, and
that it was equally certainly written
in that book that bejrg free and en
joying the same privileges under the
th
ot
R
government it was impossible for tne j
two races to live under the same gov- \
ernment. The first of his prophecies J ^
J has come to pass. Of the other I
not? know. I am sure that those who | P*
did the act now realize that the crime j
of the 19th century was in making pv
them, the negroes, equal under the: D
government. The future will take J
care if iaself. j
Dr. Kinard spoke of the needs of' 1
the schools in Newberry, which is j
nnp.Rtion for us todav. He i ?
said that we needed more money That ^
no doubt is true. We need more j R
teachers and we need to pay the ones!
we have more salary. I think he is j o'
mistaken in the statement that we rr
bavp now six mills for maintenance, i R
If I am not mistaken we have only j S.
three mills. The constitution does not;
permit over S mills for maintenance ' th
as a special tax. ; D
There was one thing in the conclud
ing rpmarks of Dr. Kinard that we
could not exactly reconcile. He made ^
a strong plea for compulsory attend- -w
Tpce and commended the State local fc,
option law and yet said if he had tli
answer now on the subject for the uj
dewberry district he would say no, ru

lie position of Gov. Blcase on the
ubject of compulsory attendance,
le favors it, but would vote against
: because we are not prepared to

lie admission to be made, then we
ad better have first a compulsory
iw to make the people provide the
acilaties. Those children who are
ot in school have just as much right
liere as those w"ho are in. That, to
ly mind, is a very impotent argument j co
gainst a compulsory attendance law. j ed

To go back to the park for a mo

i same way, when all that the don

ing "which they happened to have,
a who did very little to bring about
j establishment of the park or the
action of the school- houses, and the
rjple who really did the work that
anted in the establishment of the
rk and the school were forgotten
d not even .mentioned. Well. I
^kon it is all right, or it would not
that way. It is only a symptom
the materialistic age b-> which we
e. And the tendency which is man
st to worship at the shrine of mam
?n. These things never worry me,
d if the good people of this old town
n get some one to give a few acres
dirt for a park, or if the people
a school district can rio the same,
iv 1-t them name the park after the
nor? of the land and the school
ev.ise. It is written in the good
ol:: "Cast thy bread upon the wa
s: for thou shalt find it after main
its.'' That is as true as holy \vriT
1 make it. Sometimes U mar s
,ny long days and even years, but
it is just as sure to return as the
i sun shines. Li is also written: "He
| chat observeth the wind shall not sow;
j and he that rigardeth the clouds shall
i not rea.p." it is ours to do our duty
j as we see it, and to do it now*, ana
the results will take care of them
selves. "In the morning sow thy
seed, and in the evening withhold not
thine hand; for thou kinowest not
whether shall prosper, either this or
that, or whether uiey both shall be
alike good." So 1 go on sowing in the
morning and in the evening I with
hold not mine hand. I try to do good
all the time and to help every good
cause without thought of myself, and
I only mention this here because I
want the good people who have start
ed the park to go ahead and buy the
land and make it a permanent in
stitution of tne city and call it any
thing they want to, and they will find
me helping them all the time and injj
I every way that I can. I will wear j <
out another typewriter?machine i j i

I was reading the other day tne;

morning at 6:30 o'clock and writer
foT* an hour?and she uses a type
writer?and then has breakfast at
7:30. At 8 she is back at her desK '
and she works until one o'clock and
then after lunch she is out of doors.;
and she enjoys the best o? health. She: i
was born and reared in the good old -f ?
southern town of Richmond, Virginia,' <
and had plenty, and plenty of slaves i
to do her bidding and yet slia is the I
author of "Comon Sense in the House
hold," they tell me a great book. And j
a great cook book full of the be3t j
kind of recipes. W-hpn wenr. to j
house keeping she found the need of j
common sense. Well, Mrs. Harlana l

sh" is 86 years old and her picture r
looks like a girl of 20 summers and
she has worked a Ions: time. And I'll
bet she does not retire earlier than'
11 or 12 o'clock. And she is never

)f the heirs of John Coats based or

1! Mai. Caldwell also discussed the>
r question of the negro. This being a
' county building there could be no dts

' previous condition of servitude
; I unless we made some arrangement
11 for the negro there might be trouble
| i.i tiie future. These are all matter#
. i i.'tit should Le toiisid red.
(When the returns came in from, the
i election it was found that those w.nu
i voted were very evenly divided ar.a
the majority for the retention of the
l | building was only 33 votes. The vote
> stood for removal 113*?; against re
? mnirol 1 1 C.i? T t i-2 o cironco +V?<> r
, the big majority for removal was in
. j the town and it is due to the people
of the rural districts thai the ma

' in town precincts was as follows:,

j that the town has almost always fcce*
' in passing that it is a little Strang*#

as nappy as Dr. harms said lie was
tnat tais marks tne beginning of a

the idea was not new to me as a

you ki.ju, i nave been here a long
time, and have been laboring for the

ure to join in with him and tha

ing of the parent teachers in helpln#

of this Ouilding what 1 dreamed lor
it years ago.
There has been no legislation on
