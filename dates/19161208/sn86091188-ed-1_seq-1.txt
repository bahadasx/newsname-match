The county commissioners have un
der consideration the mater of pur
chasing a pneumatic drill for their
use in opening roads through rocky
ledges that must be blasted away
Heretofore a suitable drill has been
considered too expensive to buy but
they have heard of an apparatus for
sale at Spokane that may be had at a
bargain. Chairman Ramey has been
requested by the board to visit the
Washington city to inspect the drill.
The matter came up Informally at
the meeting of the county cemmis
aloners this week in connection with
a large amount of blasting necessary
to be done to open the Shoup road
an improvement to be made jointly by
the county and the forest service if
present plans are carried out
HARMONY MINE IS BEING
WORKED AND DEVELOPED
Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Neiman. father
and mother of Earl F. Neiman of the
Harmony mine, and Tony Stagard
who is associated with the Neimans
in the ownership of the property, are
to return to Chicago on Saturday
next. Their visit has afforded op
portunity for a thorough investigation
of the mine, which is located on With
ington creek.
They are well pleased with the
property and with the extensive work
now proceeding for ita development
and working, including an eight hun
dred-foot tunnel. The Harmony car
ries splendid values in copper and
was owned by William Anderson be
fore being acquired by the present
owners.
PACKING PLANT8 FOR
BUTTE AND 8ALT LAKE.
Of more than passing interest is
the report announcing that work is
well under way on packing houses
that will represent at Butte and Salt
Lake an investment of half a million
of dollars at each city. This estab
lishment is destined to have an im
portant place in the state. It means
that a home market has been created
for livestock and that the farmers of
Montana, Utah and Idaho will be as
sured better prices and better facil
ities for marketing their stock than
they have heretofore.
The packing plants will pay espec
ial attention to the intermountain
hog, already recognized as the equal
of the corn-fed animal of the middle
west. At one time this region pro
duced more range cattle than any
other; for many years It ranked first
in me production of sheep. Now it
will become an important producer of
pork and pork products.

Ai ANNUAL (fLEBRAIION FOR
II IFNI (0FIN1 Y HERS
WOMAN'S CLUB AND SALMON
HISTORICAL SOCIETY WILL SEE
THAT OLD FOLKS ARE NOT
FORGOTTEN.
_
i
The regular annual celebration of
Pioneer Day has at once leaped into
taxor by the notable success of the
function to inauguarte the celebration
gtven last Saturday night by the !
Woman's club and the Lemhi His- !
torlcal society, both of Salmon. At*
happier gathering together of old-tim
ers and their friends never took place
anywhere. Hereafter these celebra
tions are to come off in midsummer,
according to plans agreed upon at the
meeting, when the .Roman's club and
the Lemhi Historical society will act
together to promote them and keep
them going The date fllxed is Aug
ust 12, the anniversary of the appear
ance of the explorers, Lewis and
Clark, in Lemhi county,
county
The large hall of the club was filled
to capacity for the first celebration,
among the prominent pioneers pres
ent being Mr. and Mrs. Tom Andrews,
Riley Cooper, Billy Peterson, George
Steel, Mrs. Ella Manfull. Grandma
Yearian. Henry Bird, Judge Gilea,
Thomas Pope, Mr. and Mrs Eli Min
en. Thomas Winn, Mrs. George L.
Shoup, Mrs. Jesse McCaleb, Mount
Colwell, Billy Buchanan, Baldy Mar
tin, and many others.
Thomas Pope, Pioneer.
A paper prepared by Thomas Pope
on his early experiences in what 1 b
no» Lemhi county was read by Roy
B Herndon. Mr. Pope told of enter
ing Lemhi valley in 1862 by way of
Bircn creek, in company with a party
of goldseekers, attracted hither by
the reported placer strikes at Lees
burg. The party had many of the vi
cissitudes Incident to pioneer travel
ing but managed to get through with
out serious mishap to anybody. They
»■ere informed on the way, however,
that Leesburg, then known as Flor
ence, already had been pretty well
worked out, so there was a change
in the destination of numbers of the
immigrants, part of them going down
the Snake river to Oregon and part of
them holding to their original pur
pose of coming here. Mr. Pope was
among the latter. He had Invested
all of his wealth but |2.50 in his out
fit and the little remnant of cash he
was induced to put in tobacco at 50
cents a pound to sell on the road.
This transaction yielded an enormous
profit, for he sold the tobacco at $3 a
pound. Mr. Pope told how he found
it impossible to proceed further with
a wagon than the old fort, at which
point the value of wagons went down
while the price of horse flesh went up.
It was here that he realized on his
tobacco stock. When he proceeded
down the Lemhi river the trail led
up through the foothills and he came
oui at a point below the confluence of
the Lemhi with the Salmon, river
The Indians had used this trail in all
their travels up end down the valley.
Early Social Life.
Mrs. McCaleb read a paper she had
piepared some years ago for a liter
ar> society in Salmon, in which she
recited incidents of the life of the
pioneers of the community. The sto
ry was beautifully told, how Just af
ter the war between the states of the
north and the south numbers of the
participants in that struggle had met
here to begin life anew. Though so
lately from the scenes of strife and
stirring differences at their homes in
the east and south, they brought noth
ing but charity in their hearts when
they came to Salmon to found the
town.
Such was the setting for a beauti
ful picture of the social life of the
new community which Mrs. McCaleb
described The masculine part of the
population far outnumbered the fem
inine portion. When it became
known that an incoming stage soon
to arrive would bring a lady among
its passengers, all the eligible bach
elors of the settlement would brush
up for the occasion and hope to meet
her. one such occasion was recalled
where one swain had shined bis shoes
from day to day till they reflected bis
o»n yearning aspect when his rival
got in ahead of him and met the lady
on the »'ay down the valley before •
she reached town Moreover the ri
val married the lady to boo; and they
have lived happily even to this day
The dances given in the town were
functions of importance in the social
lift when best appearances were de
manded of all the men. who If they
had not dress suits in their own ward
robes could easily borrow what was '
lat king in their apparel Everybody i
knew he was welcome to what his
neighbor had to lend if it were not
already spoken tor for these festive
occasions. Mrs McCaleb recalled an
instance where the dress coat* in the
tow n were all in use before a certain
beau, w ho had depended upon his abll
iu to borrow one at the last minute.
bethought him of his needs He j
couldn't procure the regulation coat
because ail the regulation coats were
in use, and so he had to don a j
linen duster for the ball The writer ,
told also how in early days there
were babies born without having the j
modem luxuries and convenience* of
raising babies and carrying them
about, when on one occasion the)
town s most distinguished citizen, the
late Senator Shoup. had to resort toj
the use of an improvised baby car-!
riage. Two or three of the young
Shoup:
had been taken along on an!
evening s visit when they all fell
asleep later tn the evening. The con
siderste father did not want to waken j
ithern so he tenderly plied them into
a handy wheelbarrow and rolled them
home.
When it came the turn of Mrs.
Mattie Andrews, wife of Tom An
drews and known by everybody as
Aunt Mattie, to tell some of her -x
periences as a pioneer, that lady ad
dressed herself to a narrative that
'*>*ought forth many a laugh. She
«*'<1 part
"My first view of this beautiful val
Jfy was some 46 years ago. We, that
18 Father Andrews, Tom and myself,
,a,i camping and journeying to
* ard the Leesburg country. When we
w<re w *thin a mile and a half of the
Agency we stopped to get slicked up
to meet real white people, the first
We had seen In over a month and I
tell you they looked good to me. It
Was at the Agency I met my brother,
N 1. Andrews It was while in camp
near the Agency Senator Shoup came
by in the stage. I was making biscuit
and offered him some which he ac
cepted. This was my first meeting
with Mr. Shoup
"When we reached Salmon I wish I
could paint for you the picture Just
as it looked to me. Mr and Mrs
Shoup stood In the doorway of their
cabin that held the site now occu
pied by the Citizens National bank
with Will, who was then about
yeat old, toddling out lo the gate
We spent that night at the N. I An
drew« cabin and the next day pro
ceeded to Leesburg where Haynes
and my brother Baldy were taking
cattle to go into the business of sup
plying milk to the miners or thm
c.'imp at 75 cents per gallon
''Talk about high prices; you know
nothing about them how—although
you may soon learn something--eggs
at fl.50 per dozen and almost impoM
sible to get; butter 61 per pound;
flout 615 per hundred; sugar 635 per
sack; coffee and tea 61 per pound and
quantity not quality was the only
thing regarded
"I had never ridden a horse in my
life, let alone up a mountain, so when
I reached Leesburg father called the
girl in the hotel to get me a cup of
tea After Borne time she returned
with the word that the cook was
bucking' and wouldn't get we any
thing to eat. I wondered what the
cook was doing, for that was a new
word to me. When dinner was called
i started for the dining room when
fhe girl told me I must wait for the
second table, only men were allowed
at the first. It was eight o'clock
when the call came and by that time
1 was past being hungry Next morn
lug. i tell you, I ate at the first table
and the first to greet me was Mr. Mac
Donald, the next Mr. Sharkey. Never
could a lady anywhere be treated
with more courtesy and thoughtful
ness than tn that mining camp at
Leesburg."
Indiana Paid Their Debts.
County Attorney John E. Rees read
a paper on the Indain life of Lemhi
county as he knew It from having run
a store near the Lemhi agency for
twenty years. Most of what Mr. Rees
read was first hand information, nev
er before record e<t. particularly in
respect to the running of stores like
his own for purposes of trading large
ly with the Red Men He said that
during his experiences he had found
them remarkably honest, for al
though all bis customers al one tinn
er another obtained goods on credit,
and the total sum involved during
his mercantile business with the In
dians having run into the consider
able sum of half a million dollars, his
louses from bad debts thus contract
ed were not over 650 when he wound
up the business when the Indians
were removed to Fort Hall. For
its historical value The Recorder ex
peels to be able to publish extensive
extracts from Mr Rees' paper later
on
There were many others billed to
appear before the audience with rein
iniscenses but all of these were de
ferred for another meeting except a
story or two by W. C. Smith, the
foi mer county clerk, which were
greatly enjoyed.
Music and Refreshments.

have continued to grow with the In
crease of the flocks from year to
until this year the gross re
turns were $35,000. The expenses
less than 610.000, so she was
left with at least $25,000 clear pro
fit. Meanwhile her husband has re
mained in the cattle business and has
ptospered too.
Sheep were brought into the
alley before the venture of thla far
eelng business woman but never to
lay. In fact, they were not allowed
to stay The cattle men outlawed
them, every cattleman but her hua
band, who allowed her to get a foot
hold on the home ranch and the ad
jacent ranges «here her sheep
uid not be driven out. With a por
tion of her profits she steadily ac
quired outside lands for her flocks un
til it was not muny years before she
was independent ot the priority right*
of any cattle owners on the fall and
sluing ranges, with rights well es
labllslied in the summer ranges on
I he national forests.
The Yearian sheep now number
around 10,000 bead, all iu prime con
dit ion. They have been Improved
and graded up from the very atari.
"II Is care and attention that have
brought the best returns to me."
saidMrs. Yearian tn speaking of her
flocks, "together with a constant aim
to improve the stock. 1 noticed at
he outset in my venture that a small
band af sheep ranged in a field at
home where they got plenty to eat
ind regular water did far better than
flocks somewhat neglected and rang
ing outside When put together you
could tell them apart a quarter of
a mile away. The better conditioned
.•wes produced vastly better lambs.
Thai fact determined me to have the
flocks carefully looked after.
"When 1 started in the sheep busi
ness 1 could buy all the hay I want
ed and have it fed to my flocks at |3
a tou I paid this fall 610 a ton and
tiuve to do my own feeding at that
It Is easy to see how vastly the com
«£ of the sheep by the thousands
into Lemhi comity since my venture
in the business eight years ago has
brought wealth to the growers of hay
is well as fair profits to the flock
tnnsters themselves. And it must be
observed that the fiuckmasters get
tw< crops a yeur—from their fleece*
md their iambs—while the cattle men
get only the calves."
.Mrs Yearian Is un influential mem
ber of the National Woolgrowers' u*
loctatloa She expects to attend the
coming session of that body tn Salt
Luke in January. Keenly alive to
market conditions affecting wool and
mutton prices she discusses these
uibjects us an authority with the
heads of these bodies of men when
ever tile sessions are held. Fresl
ient Hagenbarth of the national a*
tociailon was himself a Lemhi county
man before he settled in Southeast
Idaho In the sheep business. She
knows him and the secretary of the
same body. Dr. 8. W. McClure, very
well.
And yet Mrs Yearian 1» as much at
home In society and in the midst of
lier refined family as she is in look
ing after her flock* and marketing of
their Increase and their fleece*, for
which she always get* the top prices.
With her husband and a grown son
she occupies the largest dwelling
house in the county, where the Year
lun hospitality dispensed is famous in
all the countryside. The location 1*
abiui half way up the Lemhi valley, 35
miles from Salmon There are
guests in the home nearly all the
time Two daughters are married and
two other daughters are attending
■thool, one at Salmon and the other
■ii Spokane When they get home in
the summer time there Is pretty near
ly the ideal family life in the large
circle extended to include friends
Mrs. Yearian was a school teacher
and a capable one before she be
came unstress of the home over
which she now presides.
