W. O. W. ELECTION
Do you know that a fierce battle be
tween the Pale Faces and Red Skins
wus once fought within the boundaries
of what is now Grady county? Well,
it's a fact whether you havo heard of
it or not, and a movement is under
way to celebralo tho 60th anniversay
of tho conflict.
State Senator Thos.J, O'Neill has re
ceived a letter from J. B. Thohurn, of
the department of history of Oklaho
ma university, calling attention to the
proposed celebration and asking his
eo-operution in Interesting the state
legislature in tho matter. Ho also en
closed a copy of a letter which he has
written to Congressman Ferris, in
which the latter is asked to secure
federal aid for the celebration. This
letter Is as follows
December 0, 1916.
Dear Mr. Ferris:
You may recall that on the occasion
of our last meeting I nit,r.tioned the
fact that some of us are interested in
a proposition to celebrate tho COth an
nlversary of the battle between a
force of U. S. troops under tho com
mand of Maj. Earl Van Dorn and a
band of Comanche Indians -encamped
at the Wic:hita village, which was sit
uated a few miles eaBt of tho present
town of Rush Springs, in Grady coun
ty, which occurred October 1st, 1858.
It is proposed to place a monument,
or marker on the sito of tho conflict
and to have tho same unveiled with
appropriate ceremonies. Tho pro
gram should bo so arranged that its
tone would be so pacific that the In
dians can havo a part in it.
Such a celebration should be ar
ranged jointly between the state and
federal governments. I believe that if
the matter is taken up in duo time,
the war department could be Induced
to co operate to tho extent of sending
a detachment of tho old Second (now
Fifth) U. S. cavalry to participate
possibly the same four companies
which were engaged in that action
and thus add to the impressiveness ot
the occasion.
The 50th anniversary of the battle
of the Washita will occur a few weeks
later and. I am writing to Mr. McClin-
tic with tho suggestion that he might
Join with you jn whatever action may
be necessary to secure the participa
tion of the government with the local
and state interests Involved In this
matter. Of course, in the case of the
other cedebnition, the military repre
sentation should bo from tho Seventh
cavalry instead ot the from the Fifth
cavalry.
I have already written to Gen. Hugh
L. Scott, chief of the general stuff of
the army, In regard to the matter.
General Scott, as a lieutenant of the
Seventh cavalry, was stationed at Ft.
Sill for a number of years. Twenty
five years ago, he visited the site of
the Washita fight, which was In Roger
Mills county, and placed tha small
temporary markor which should now
bo replaced by a permanent monu
ment, and he ! i(ea.i.iy interested in
tho local bister of Oklahoma, so I
am sure that you may count upon bis
active co-operation.
I would respectfully suggest that
you have a conference with Mr. Mc
Clintic in regard to this matter ut
your) earliest convenience. I will try
to stir up some interest at this end of
tho line.
It may bo of Interest in this connec
tion to remark that four of the offi
cers engaged in that action were sub
sequently generals in the Confederate
urmy, namely, Karl Van Dorn, Nathan
iel Q. Evans, Jas. Major and L. S. Ross.
The latter was not an army officer
but was tho twenty-year-old captain
or leader of a band of friendly Indians
which was attached to Van Doru'g
command; ho was one ot the young
est general officers in the Confeder
ate service and, in ISSfi, was elected
governor ot Texas.
I know you will bo interested in
aiding thij movement and I feel sure
that you are In a position to do so
most effectively.
