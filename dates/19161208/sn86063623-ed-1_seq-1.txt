LEXINGTON CHAPTER NO
10, ROYAL ARCH MASONS
Entertains the Grand High
Priest and Other Digni
taries. Election of
Officers.
In response to an invitation
of Lexington Chapter No. 10
Royal Arch Masons a large num
ber of mason throughout the
county and many high digni
taries of the grand lodge assem
bled in Lexington Tuesday in
a special-regular convocation in
honor of the Grand High Priest
George T. Burnham, of Milan,
Mo., and to assist in conferring
the Mark Master's and the Past
Master's degree and to particip
ate in the ceremonies of the
completion of the Temple.
The first mentioned degree
was conferred by members of
Mt Hope Lodge No. 476, A. F.
& A. M. and members of Lexing

master overseer ; Chris Wagner,
Fenior overseer; R. L. Seafros3,
junior overseer; Sam C. Baggar
ly, senior deacon; C. P. Green,
junior deacon and H. W. Mc
Neel, marshal. The work of
these officers .was thoroughly
enjoyed and an inspiration to
all present.
Later in the. afternoon the
Tast Master's degree was con
ferred by Dr. Walter R. Eckle.
Pr. Eckle's state wide reputa
tion for excellence in masonic
work was lurcher enhanced in
this ceremony. It was thorough
im( impressive, not only i:o the
ndidates but to all companions.
At six o'clock the real artists
the occasion gave further
f of their proficiency in gas
omy. Every mason in Lafay
county already knows the
e of "the same worthy
;e, but, by chance there is
Rip Van Winkle in the or
der et to awaken, their names
are hereby mentioned : M. C. Mc
Fadin, C. L. Glasscock and F.
Lee Wallace. Their last exhibi
tion was their best. Perhaps
some one will read this who was
not present Tuesday and won
der at the possibility of the
truthfulness of that statement,
but we can assure him that no
exaggeration is possible when
those three meet with one com-j L. II, S. CLOSE SEASON
mon purpose that of feeding WITH A VICTORY
"The Salt of the Earth."
The feast was followed by a ys Play With Bull Dog Ten-
banquet or toasts, nigh rnest
II. T. Phillips introduced a few
of the visiting companions who
responses gave further proof
that "the same worthy three"
had served no misbranded foods
and that the brain will respond
to right treatment of the stom
ach. The ccrernonies of the comple
tion of the temple was a fitting
climax of the evening's enjoy
ment. Robert N- Allen as right
worshipful master was superb.
His dignity and assurance em
phasized in detail the essentials
of the constructive work of this
degree and gave those present
further enlightment in the work
that was inspiring.
'The music by a quartette com
posed of Mrs. James R. Moore-
head, Jr., Mrs. Worth Bates,
Wm. Aull, Jr., and John J.
Price, with B. M. Little at the
organ, enhanced the impressive-

BOY RUN OVER AND KILLED
acity and Reverse Former
Defeat by Oak Grove.
The Lexington High School
gridiron gladiators Thursday
met Oak Grove on the W. M. A.
ground and smeared the visitors
by a score of 13 to 7. The local
boys were defeated by the same
team about a week ago, at Oak
Grove, but this time they were
playing for their letters and
although outweighed by a good
margin they scored two touch
downs and kicked one goal in the
first half.
The' second half was a gruel
ling, smashing contest; the local
boy's fighting "to have and to
hold" what they had made and
the visitors with equal despera
tion trying to overcome that
lead and annex the game. But
there was nothin' doing in that
line, and although crowded
pretty hard,, they held to the
finish and won by shere pluck.
The star of the game was
Tommy Holleron, the local
quarterback, who played a bril
liant game against the huskies.
Other pigskin artists who shone
brightly were Gillespie, Cross,
Lundberg and Lindblad.
Son of Mr., and Mrs. Theo. Rob
inson Victim of Automobile.
Jesse Robinson, the young son
of Mr. and Mrs. Theo. Robinson,
who conduct a boarding house
near the McGrew mine, was run
over by an automobile driven by

about 11:30 o'clock and instant
ly killed. The boy's skull was
fractured and back broken, and
no doubt, died instantly. Miss
Brooks was on her way to Well
ington when the accident hap
pened. The little fellow was born
January 24, 1912, and was near
ly five years of age. The funeral
was held from the home Friday

Kemper Lacked the Punch. The

a Deciding Factor, y
Wentworth Thursday cinched
the claim to the prep-school
championship of Missouri in
football by defeating the Kem
per Military School at Boonville
by the decisive score of 17 to 7.
It is believed by many who saw
the game that Kemper had the
better team from their shoulders
down. They had the ball two
thirds of the time, and in the
first quarter, with the aid of
thirty-five yards in penalties,
made' their only points 7, on a
touchdown and a goal.
In the third quarter, began the
beginning of the end of all
things for Kemper. About the
middle of the field a Kemperito
fumbled; a Wentwoihite, Col
lins by name, grabbed said fum
ble and with a clear field before
him made record time in cross
ing the goal line. Mozely kicked
goal. Wentworth 7 ; Kemper 7.
The fourth quarter found
Kemper in possesion of the ball
on their own 45 yard line. Af
ter seesawing back and forth, a
punt was blocked by Wentworth
and the ball recovered. On the
second play Minor carried the
ball over and Mozley kicked goal.
Wentworth 11; Kemper 7. Af
ter the kickoff and with only a
few minutes to play, Cedar re
placed Mozley and made a beau
tiful drop Jdck from the 25-yd.
line. Wentworth 17; Kemper 7.
