4 STATS EDUCATORS HI' IILY
1 . ENTERTAINED AT : I ANTA FE.
w Til welcome which tt e teachera rs
- Mind at SanU Fe d ring the past
meeting of the State .Jucational Ae
aociatlon waa admi': J by all to b
the greatest in the istory of tha or
ganisation. Althc .i mora than Al
tean hundred per - .na were In atten
dance, there waa no complaint at any
tima 1 to accommodaVena received.
Oí coarte the l.utels are not Efficient
to accommodr i thla number but the
people of Santa Fe opened their
Lm to tua teachera. ' Even the
Governor! manaion waa used in thia
Wiitomobilea met each train and ao
aerfect waa tha organisation of tha
) people in charge that there waa never
any delay, in- taking ma viaitora to
their rooma. Meals were served in
all the principal buildings of the
hi at un reasonable rates.
The principal meeting place for
tha teachers was the Masonic Cathe
dral ana there is certainly no build
in r in the state better suited for
suck purpose. Ail ine otate uni
wra. Including- the rovernor and mem
fcera of the 8upreme Court were in
attendance at many or tne meet
inn. '
Considered from the standpoint of
program, thia was perhaps by lar
the moat interesting meeting the as
inflation has aver had. Mr. Sluts,
a Superintendent of 3chools, Pueblo,
"J Colorado, and Mr. Pearse, Ex-Presi-
dent of the National Educational As
sociation, were the principal speakers
from outaida the state. Those men
spoke to audiences of from one to
two thousand people and were well
received.
Tha principal topic of deliberation
and thought to tha teacnere waa edu
cational legislation. Tha teachers felt
that since the new legislatura waa
bout to convene, it was necesssry
that definite recommendations be
mate looking towards educational leg-
lslston. All these recommendations
went embodied in resolutions which
I were passed at tha lose of the as-
Tgiocietion.
v Hq satisfactory was the meeting
.at Santa Fe that a great majority of
'teachers were of the opinion that the
next meeting should also be held in
Sank Fe and when the time came to
elect tha place of meeting large
majority of the ballots expressed this
' eifSioa.
U wm gratifying to see that un
doubtedly the most powerful force
m ta state Is that making lor the
eetaatioM of the children. The Con
vention waa attended not only by
teachera but by business men. All
thia made for better understanding
between teachers and tax-payers and
will undoubtedly have its effect upon
educational finance.
When one remembera that the As-
wciation held at Santa Fe about five
rears Ago had only about four hun
dred in attendance, some idea can be
had of the progress of educational
sentiment in the past Ave years. It
nukes jne . realise that there is no
stale in the union with a more promising-
future than New Mexico.

ATTENTION FARMERS AND LIVE
STOCK MEN.
Fencing your ranch or farm Is
matter of vital Importance to yon
and doubtless your experience has
proven to you how difficult It Is- to'
keep straggling animals from getting '
in and your own uve swkx gcmngi
out. '
ay using rnvniUbba oiuu
FENCE POSTS you save time and
money. You can haul from 7 to 10
Hercules Steel Posts as compared to
a- r ... TT, .m íim?r T '
one wood post. Hercúlea Posta can
be driven Into the ground in about
80 seconds, while It takes at least
fifteen to twenty minutes to set a
wood post. .
Hercules Steel Posts will not bunt
Prairie Ares need not worry you.
This also means you can burn your
fence lines and free them from
weeds and vermin. Hercúlea Steel
Fence Posts are protection for cat
tle agamst lightning aa each post is
a lightning rod in itself.
Hercules Steal Posta are made from
rail steel rolled into 1 1-4 inch angles
with an anchor plate riveted on six
inches elowb the ground line. This
plate anchors your posta and also
prevents them from cutting through!
the ground. The post being made
from spring steel will give a little
when called upon to stand a strain
and will then spring back into place.
The Hercules Steel Post Co., Chicago,
will give a GUARANTEE BONU
against Hercules posts bending or
breaking within a period of six years
from date of sale. The Poets will
essily last twenty to thirty years,
which la four or Ave timet the Hie of
a wood post.
Hercules Posts are a combination
of all good point of the Steel post
family. Let us tell you how we can
make the price so low. These are
Ave of the biggest savings we make
for you in 'the first place there is no
middle man or dealer to pay out of
the cost of these poets. In the second
piece we have, just one warehouse
and that is In Chicago where we make
the posts. In the third place you pay
your own freight. We donl aak you
to pay part of Mr. California's freight
In the fourth place, you pay cash, and
in the fifth place there are no patent
royalties to pay.
Each aaving is small In itself, but
all of them together mean that buy
ing from us is a great big saving to
you. This saving sometimes amounts
to 11 cents a post and a saving of 7
cents a post is surely yours. Seven
cents on 100 posts is 7.00 real money
That will buy 85 more posts 85 Her
cules Spring Steel Fence Posta made
of the eetb railroad steel. Every
time you drive a line of Hercules
Posts on your farm or ranch, you
Increase' the value and the appear
ance of your land. Good permanent
fence always does that and Hercules
Poete are the best poeta for perma
nence. They stay lined up. In the
Hercules system the end Corner and
the gate poeta are set in concrete.
The only proper way.
You doubtless are familiar with
steel posts. We wish to tell yon
of the Hercules Spring Steel Post.
The poet that combines all the best
points of Steel Poet family. The width
thickness and spring are figured to
make the Hercules the touest post.
The anchor la he sise, i'aape and
place to do the most good. The holes
are near the edge that Insures a
tight and strong fence fastening.
And there is another reason why we
can give our iron clad guarantee
Hercules finish la standard. We
haven't let the war affect the qual
ity ef either ear black or gray finish.
Just smoke a pipe on that. And
while you are smoking, sit right
down and send In your order to Mr.
Henry J- Unge, Carlsbad, N. M.
You may have some doubts they are
unnecessary. Heree something to
chew on. We would have to charge
the dealer more than we are charg
ing you because we would have to
pay a salenman to go and see him,
and your kind friend, the dealer,
wanta a profit Dealers would have
to sail Hercules Posts to you at SO
cents to 85 cents apiece depending on
the freight. We have 10 years of
fencing history back of us. We
know Hercules la the best post. Yon
know lt'a the lowest price. If yon
write me for more information, my
answer will prove the Hercules Poeta
are what you want

SANTA FE MAKES '
EMPLOYES A PRESENT.
The employee of the SanU Fe sys
tem will receive a neatpresent for
Christmas. President E. P. Ripley,
announces that the directors have au
thorised a lump distribution of ten
per cent of a year's pay to all em
ployee that are paid $2,000.00 a year
or lose and whose pay la not fixed
by present or past contract schedule.
The paymenta will be made aa soon
as ths necessary computations can
be completed. It Is Mr. Ripley's in
tention to hse the distribution made
during the holidays. It may be not
ed that this additional compensation
goes to the employee who, are paid
least.
The reason assigned for thia action
is that the past two years tne Santa
Fe system has enjoyed abnormal pros
perity due to the war In Europe. Hut
the factors that have brought this
the same time added a very substan
tial increase In the cost of living.
Recognising these conditions the di
rectors decided to make this ten per
cent distribution to the employes who
have been in the service two yesre
or more and who are receiving pay
below 12,000 a year. These payments
so authorised will approximate ten
million, seven hundred and fifty thou
sand dollars.
It may be noted here the Santa
Fe System the past year operated
11.270.70 miles of track. Add to this
the second, third, and fourth tracks
snd yard tracks and sidings, there is
a track mileage of 16.34(1.24 miles.
The onerating fevenucs were $133,-
7(52,192.24 and the operating expen
ses I83,730,(M10.35. The net per cent
income on the property investment
the past year waa 6.10 per cent, the
highest in the history of the road.
Though the revenues of the Santa
Fe System have increased greatly,
the net return on the Investment is
still low.
It has taken careful business man
agement of the System to bring it to
its present efficiency and in recogni
tion of the part that the employes
have taken in the progress of the
Santa Fe, the insurance plan was
fiut into force on July 1, 1918, and
he present distribution authorized by
the board of directors.

from tha Federal Farm Loan 8ystem,

passed to his recommendationa for a
broader government for I'orlo Rien,
He whs just sliout to begin a seu
ttnee: "The present liiws governing the
island and regulating the rights snd
privileges of its people are not just,"
when over the rail of the gallery,
where sst a party of women suffrage
leaders, there fluttered down above
the heads of the amaxed assemblage
of senators snd representatives a silk
en banner of suffrage yellow, bearing
in great Mack letters the inscription:
"President Wilson, what will you
do for woman suffrage?"
Method of Protest
. The suffragists said afterward it
was their protest against the presi
dent's plea with congress for broader
suffrage for the men of Porto Rico,
while he did not mention their own
cause in his sddress.
As the banner rinplcd down, the
suffragists sat smiling and unper
turbed, watching the effect. A di
minutive pare, raised on the arms of
men directly under the gallery,
trracned the edge nf the banner and
snatched It down, rresldent Wilson,
"ttrscted by the stir, looked un from
his reading and, apparently taking in
the situation at a glance, smiled
lirnacllv snd without hesitstion or in
terruption, turned his eyes back to his
manuscript snd continued his address
to Its end without further demonstra
tions. Policemen and gallery guards scur
ried to where the women were seat
ed, hut contented themselves with
watchin the party, to prevent s fur-
ther outbrenk,
Koffrsgiats File Out.
When the joint session was over,
the suffragists filed out unmolested by
Se police who said they hsd no or
ders then to prevent any further in
fringement of the ruies of the homo.
The banner remained a trophy with
the sargeantat-arms.
As it turned out, the women had
their ' plsns laid with precision and
sprung their coup almost on th sec
ond. Kvidentlv in possession of an ad

they hod timed the document at the

riving Ine names of the militnnU and
interviews with each.
The concensus of their opinion was
summed up by Mrs. Abby Scott Raker
of the Congressional union, who de
clared the incident waa "expressive of
the Indignation that women feel at the
stupid and senseless opposition to
granting the right of self government
to one-half of the people of the
United States."
The ten women who participated in
the coup marched off, acclaimed hero-
ines.to Congressional union headquar
ters, where they hela a reception.
Miss Mabel Vernon of Nevada, nr.
Caroline Spencer of Colorado, Mrs.
Florence Bayard Utiles of Delaware,
Mrs. John Rodger of New York, Mr.
Anna Lownburg of Pennsylvania, Mr.
Bessie II. Hapandre and Miss Maud
Gilbert of California, Mrs. W. L. Colt
of New York. Miss Lucy Burns of ths
Congressional union, and Mrs. Town-
send 8cott of Maryland, composed ths
suffragist party. The first Ave held
the banner and the later five acted
aa guards, prepared to resist Interfer
ence. The women had carried on
their operations so carefully, however,
that none of the hundreds of specta
tors around them had any Inkling of
their plans.
Coup Works Well.
The coup, say ths suffragists,
worked well enough to suit them,
even if it failed to draw any ac
k no lodgement, and thsy plan some
thing more startling the next time.
Everybody around the Congressional
union who had anything to do with it
waa keen for another.
"It waa am oat excellent demon
stration," said Chairman Alice Paul,
smiling happily, "certainly we may in
the future adopt various methods not
dissimilar from the one we used to
day to keep congress reminded of our
cause.
Miss Lucy Burns declared the suf
frage question was the only one be
fore congress today when President
Wilson finished reading hie address.
"When he finished." she ssid, "the
senstors and representatives on the
floor turned toward us and muttereoT
the one word, 'Suffragists'. No one
said 'Adamson law' or 'Porto Rico'.
We feci that we did our duty today
and we never should have forgiven
ourselves had we overlooked it"
Other members smiled while Mian
Burns end Miss Paul tslked, and all
were anxious to know what impres
