Red Cross Campaign
Red Cross seals were first put
on the market in 1907 in the sin
gle state of Deieware. The
movement has since spread over
the entire country, and over
$3,000.000 has been raised from
the sale of seals while hundreds
of associations have been formed
which are fighting tuberculosis
in nearly every state and terri
tory. Facts about tuberculosis
have been published; helpful
j tuberculosis scars on our lungs or,

your own personal health, mon-!
ey atl( ] happiness, but it may
men incalculable loss to your
own family and your own associ
ates, folt- the fact that someone
has it i.s a menace to to the health
of those most dear to you. for
from one to five infections come.
In the war abroai the Red
Cross ministers to the wounded;
we wage a war in which Red
laws have been passed; hospitals
dispensaries, open air schools and
visaing nurses have been estât
lished, suffering has been relived
and lives have been saved as aj
result of the sale of Xmas Red
Cross Seals. The educational in

even if no sa e is made; every

every health talk elietied by the
seals has counted in educating
the community to guard against
tuberculosis.
None of us can afford to be in
different to tuberculosis. In the
first place, you d o not know
whether or not you may have the
disease, for statistics show that
90 per cent of us who appear to

Cross Xmas Seals bring relief to
the suffering and dying as well
as defense against the enemy it
self. This enemy, tuberculosis,
is more deadly than an armed foe,
claiming one death out of 1-3 of
all who die between the ages o
12 and 45. and costing us over
$500,000.000 a year in loss of life
and labor. Will you not enlist in
the campaign?
The Miles City Daily papers
have raised their subscription
price from $5.00 to $7.50 a year.
This raise was forced upon the
publishers through the steady in
crease in the price of print paper
A car of print paper cost the pub
iishers in Miles City $702 a year
ago and today the price stands at
$2,800 and the limit is not yet in

At The Play House
A most excellent special attrac
tion will be shown at the Play
House on Tuesday night, Decem
ber 12th. This will be the fam
ous William Fox masterpiece,
"Carmen". The celebrated act
ress Theda Bara, has the title
role in this play and no expense
has been spared t o hring the
production to the acme of perfec
tion. The story of the play is
well known, having been produc
ed on the legitimate stage and
published in novel form. Raoul
A. Walsh who produced the mo
tion picture play has far surpas
sed both the novelist and the
dramatist. 'J'heda Bara, the act
ress has won world wide reputa
tion as a film star and is suppor
ted in this pif piece by an unusu
ally mpetent company. As Car
men, the haughty and intollerant
gypsy flirt, she has earned the
title of the greatest vampire wo
mrn of the screen, "Hades Hand
Maiden" and "Satans Soul Mate"
are some of her appelations. The
costumes and scenery of old Spain
add their lustre to this production
and a Spanish bull-fight is one of
the incidents of the piece.
