Bond Election Tomorrow
Tomorrow, Saturday Dec. 9,
there will be held in the school
house in Holbrook an election for
the purpose of deciding whether
or not bonds to the amount of
$8,000 shall be issued to complete
the new school building now in
course ef construction. The polls
will be open from 10 o'clock a. m.
until 6 o'clock p. m. Every voter
in the school district who has
paid a property tax, and who is
otherwise qualified, is entitled to
vote at this election.
The first bond issue for the
new school building was $25,000.
Before the contract was let it
was found that the money voted
was not sufficient to build a
school house such as Holbrook
needed. The contract was let,
however, the plan being at that
time to call an election to vote
additional bonds. Such an elec
tion was called and was held
several weeks ago. A large ma
jority of votes was cast in favor
of the bonds, but it was after
wards learned by ihe board of
trustees that the election had not
been legally conducted the polls
had not been keep open the
length of time required by the
statute. Hence it became nec
essary to call another election
and this will be held tomorrow.
With tne original issue of $25,
000 and with the $8,000 which it
is hoped will be voted Saturday,
there will be available the total
sum of $33,000. This amount
will complete the new school
building as first planned, and
will equip it with furniture and
apparatus needed. It is though
that there will be very few votes
cast against the bonds.

Governor Hunt Starts Contest
From the Arizona Gazette of
Dec. 7, we reprint the following
anent the contest for governor
of Arizona:
"Secretary of State Sidney
Osborn has certified to Gov.
Hunt the election of Tom Camp
bell as Governor of Arizona by a
plurality of 30 votes and has also
certified the election of the other
state officials elected Nov. 7th.
With the exception of Hunt the
entire Democratic ticket is elect
ed by pluralities ranging from
19,470 to 536. Secretary Osborn
is out of town today and there
fore the issuance of the individ
ual certificates of elections, in
accordance with the usual cus
tom has been delayed. The Wil
son electors have carried the
state by 14,646.
"The anticipated contest of
election over the office of gover
nor is now on and the matter is
properly before the court for
consideration. Yesterday after
noon Secretary of State Sidney
Osborn completed his canvass of
the returns from the counties
and officially announced that
Tom Campbell had received a
plurality of thirty votes over
Gov. G. W. P. Hunt.
'Immediately following his an
nouncement, Gov. Hunt, accom
panied by his counsel, Eugene
S. Ivea, Homer Wood and Attor
ney General Wiley E. Jones, ap
peared in the office of the clerk
of the superior ccurt and filed a
petition for an inspection of all
the votes cast for governor m
the election of Nov. 7. This
petition was accompanied by the
customary fee of $10, and Gov.
Hunt gave bond in the sum of
$300, Wood and Charles R.
Howe, tax commissioner, being
his bondsmen.
"This morning shortly after
the opening of court, counsel for
both sides appeared before Judge
Stanford and what is expected
to be a long drawn out legal
battle began. The proceedings
were brief, but they are regard
ed ss merely preliminary, and
those familiar with court pro
cedure and the handling oi
election contests are freely pre
dieting that this contest will b'
drawn out for several months.''

Forest Service Notes
The resources of the National
Forests are shown to be steadily
increasing in value and use. They
returned $340,000 more in the
treasury this year than last;
more timber is being sold, and
nearly three-fourths of a million
head of stock has been added to
the carrying capacity of the for
est ranges. A very large in
crease has taken place in their
use for summer homes and other
recreational purposes.
The Secretary of Agriculture
sounds a strong warning against
the proposition to turn the Na
tional Forests over to the states,
or to disintegrate them by the
passage of general grant laws
such as the one attempted by the
last session of congress, and
wisely vetoed by the President.
He points out that the govern
ment has found it necessary to
re-purchase essentially similar
lands in the eastern mountains to
prevent the destruction of their
watershed value by private ex
ploitation, and urges that to part
title with the western forests
would be to repeat the same mis
take. The report of the Secretary
shows that 2,000.000 acres of
public lands, partly forest lands,
have been successfully cleaned
of prairie dogs at a cost of 5c per
acre, but that 22,000,00 acres are
still infested, to the serious detri
ment of their value for graz
ing purposes. Nearly 25,000
wolves and coyotes have been
destroyed by the Department
within the year, and a continu
ance of the work is strongly rec
ommended. The annual loss of
livestock caused by predatory
animals is estimated at $12,000,
000, The immediate adoption of a
clear cut .National rark policy is
urged. The tendency toward
wholesale establishment of Na
tional Parks is condemned as
useless and confusing. All areas
embracing outstanding scenic
features and natural wonders,
such as the Grand Canyon, the
Yosemite and the Yellstone,
should be made parks, and all
other areas, i. e., areas chiefly
valuable for the development and
other material resources, should
be left as National Forests. The
transfer of the National Park
Service from the Department of
the Interior to the Department
of Agriculture is suggested for
consideration, and the necessity
of the closest correlation and
co-operation between the Park
Service and the Forest Service
is clearly explained.
The passage of the Federal Aid
Road Act is characterized as
"one of the most important
and far reaching steps in Nation
al Forest development which has
been taken for a long time."
No Mixtures For Road Racers
"All but three of the sixteen
contestants in the recent Doug
las to Phoenix road race took
particular pains tb secure
straight-distilled, all - refinery
gasoline, and the winners of
first, second and third places
were among the wise thirteen",
said J. E. Balsley District Sales
Manager of the Standard Oil
Company, yesterday, while dis
cussing the ever-present subject
of pure gasoline.
"The lesson to be drawn from
this incident by motorists, is the
tact that practically all of the
contestants carefully avoided
mixtures and doped gas.
"A racing driver is out to win.
He is wise to all the tucks that
make victory more certain, and
he knows that mixtures and
doped gas are unreliable, causing
loss of power and carburetor
difficulties. They all spoke of
these points before the race, and
I know what kind of fuel they
used because they filled with
our Red Crown gasoline.
"The winner, C. L Cord,
driving a Paige, was frank
enough to give most of the credit
for his victory to the uniform
power he obtained from our
gasoline."
