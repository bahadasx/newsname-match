ON TRACT BETWEEN OLYM
PIA AND TACOMA.
Establishment of an army division
post of 15,000 men on 70,000 acres
of land on Nisqually plains neas
American lake, about half-way be
tween Olympia and Tacoma, carry
ing with it an Immediate expenditure
by the war department of $4,000,000
in preparing the site and an annual
maintenance expenditure payro-i.
food and forage bill of more than
$7,000,000, has been formally author
ized by the war department, providing
Pierce county buys and donates the
site to the government. Offlc'a! an
nouncement of the agreement was
made the fore part of this week.
Acting upon the agreement, the
Pierce county commissioners have set
January 6 next as the date when
voters of that county will be asked
to authorize a $2,000,000 bond lssut j
to carry out its part of the bargain.
The commissioners' action was based
upon a petition presented by 150 tax
payers, and it is said by those behind
the plan th-i f the amount :>sked may
not be necessary, but that sum will
cover every contingency. The North
ern Pacific owns 2,837 acres of land,
which ThoTris Cooper, of the com
pany's lan.i department, has offered
to sell ts the government for $8.30 an
acre.
Will Foil Speculators.
Assurance that speculators will not
have a shance to grab the profits is
shown by the fact that the land will
be purchased through condemnation
proceedings, and every block of acre
age will be appraised by a competent
board.
The subject has been under consid
eration for several months. It has
been engineered by Stephen Appleby,
a banker, who, with a committee, re
cently visited the secretary of v<ar in
Washington City and obtained from
him a written pledge to establish a
division post at this point if the
people will donate the land.
President Wilson has taken the
natter up as an administration policy
and a number of prominent army
officers, including Maj. Qen. J. Frank
lin Bell, of the Western department
headquarters in San Francisco, are
giving it their support. .
Hite Is Desirable.
The desirability of acquiring this
lite has been emphasized in a number
of reports to the war department
within the last dozen years.
The agreement with the secretary
of war calls for the location at this
post of an army division, or about
670 officers and 15,000 men, and it
will be the largest permanent mili
tary encampment in America. The
government is prepared at once to
expend about $4,000,000 in making
the site ready, in a temporary way,
for the troops, and then will proceed
to permanent construction. Involving
the expenditure of many millions of
dollars. The annual pay roll and
food and forage bill will be about
17,000,000.
The post is designed to become the
maneuver ground for state troops of
the Northwest as far east as the Da
kotaß, and the authorities say that
at times the total number of troops
here will be 100,000.
The area embraces the land once
held by the Hudson Bay company,
and its western boundary is only a
short distance from Fort Stellacoom,
an important early day post.
Former Local Barber Arrested.
Reports received In Olympla tell

PROPOSE PURIFYING PLANT
Council to Investigate Advisability of
improvement to Local Waterworks
The city council with the assist
ance of City Engineer J. B. Weddell
and the engineers of other cities will
conduct an investigation into the ad
visability of constructing a purifica
tion plant at tije city water works,
following a recommendation made by
Mayor Mottman.
Plans for the installation of new
mains from the springs and wells
from which the city's water supply
is drawn, to the pumping plant, were
considered by the council this wepk,
when City Engineer Weddell report
ed that the cost of new pipe lines
would practically equal the cost of
a purification works. This resulted
in the council deciding to seek ex
pert advice as to the best way of
handling the situation.
ELS HOW PRIZE
CORN WIS on
C. A. HARTSUCK EXPLAINS CUL
TIVATION OF CROP THAT
WON OVER NORTHWEST.
When announcement was made
that Charles A. Hartsuek, of this
county, had on corn grown on his
farm near Tumwater won first prize
over all entries in the Northwestern
Corn Show at Walla Walla last month
under the auspices of the 0.-W. R. R.
& N. company, not only was there
much surprise and great interest, but
there came one inquiry after another,
all of the same burden—"How did he
do it?"
Western Washington generally has
a reputation of being a very poor
corn country, albeit the campaigns
conducted in recent years by the
0.-W. and other railroads and agen
cies have done a lot to overcome the
former skepticism regarding the
adaptability of that grain to the cli
matic conditions of this section. But
now that Thurston county grown
corn has won out in a contest with
corn from tho favored sections of all
parts of the Northwest, it is held that
sufficient demonstration has been
given that corn, and gqod corn, can
be successfully matured here.
Mr. Hartsuck's prize was won on
Yellow Estacada Dent corn, and
I when asked to tell of the manner in
which it was raised, he said:
"I plowed the ground last fall, let
ting it lay in furrow over winter. In
the spring I disced and plowed it
again, then again disced It after
plowing, until the seedbed was well
fined.
"I planted it May 12th, in rows 42
inches apart and with hills 36 inches
apart, with from three to five kernels
in each hill, planting two and a half
inches deep.
"I cultivated it six times and hoed
it three times, keeping the top well
stirred and all weeds down. The soil
is a sandy loam.
"From the half acre planted five
tons were cut and fed green, and hav
ing left the best ears, I harvested 600
well developed ears, gathered from
240 hills. Of these 300 are good,
first-class seed corn. The seed was
not gathered until after the frost.
The greater part was husked and
dried in a warm room, but some was
left in the husk on the stalk and left
In shelter, out of the wet, and ripened
up in good shape."
This corn is as solid as though
grown in what is known as a corn
country. The ears are small, but the
stalk Is of a good sice and would
make fine silage.
Mr. Hartsuck is a Arm believer In
the possibilities for corn growing In
this part of Washington If acclimat
ed seed is used and proper care Is
given.
Continued favorable business con
ditions throughout the country, with
all markets extremely active, prices
going up In many lines and high lev
els of production set In others, are
noted in the federal reserve board's
monthly tabulation of reports from
reserve agents, made public this
[week. Serious car shortage was re
ported from nearly every section,
however, during the last month, and
it was said to be the chief impedi
ment to further increase of commer
cial and Industrial activity.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1916.
NORTHWEST WINS FI6HT
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION
Federal Board Knocks Out $17.50
Differentials in Round-Trip
Fares.
The fight of Northwest states
against an arbitrary charge of $17.50
to tourists wishing to visit the Pacific
coast by way of the Northwest was
won in a decision announced this
week by the interstate commerce
commission.
The case was that filed by Charles
A. Reynolds as chairman of the state
public service commission, and which
Mr. Reynolds argued before the com
mission during October last in Wash
ington. D. C., after he had retired as
chairman of the public service com
mission.
For ten years the Northwest has
been discriminated against by the
railroads in favor of the southern
routes to and from California by a
regulation which allowed a trip to
and from California for the same fare
over the Southern routes, but which
finally added an extra charge of
$17.50 to the face of those wishing
either to come or return through the
Northwest.
Complete readjustment, however,
of passenger fares between Eastern
gateways and the Pacific Coast may
be necessary in view of the decision.
Traffic officials are of the opinion that
passenger fares between all Coast
points and Chicago would be raised
sufficiently to absorb the differential.
SWI SESSION OF
GimGRESS STMITS
RAILROAD REFORMS AND FOOD
PRICES CONSTITUTE NEW
ISSUES THIS WINTER.
Congress reconvened Monday for a
three months' session, with a calendar
overcrowded with general legislation,
facing railroad reforms and the high
cost of living as new issues, and con
fronted with unprecedented estimates
aggregating $1,354,815,654 to meet
expenditures on the government for
the next fiscal year.
Estimates of the expenses of all
branches of the government for the
fiscal year 1918, upon which congress
will base its appropriations, total
$1,268,715,834. This sum is exclu
sive of $325,355,820 to be appropri
ated for the postal service, which is
expected to be returned to the treas
ury by postal revenue, and a sinking
fund appropriation of $60,748,000 to
ward the public debt.
Increase Is $84,000,000.
The total appropriations for the
fiscal year 1917 ending next June, ex
clusive of these two items, were sl,-
184,157,517. The increase of some
$84,000,000 represents the general
trend of the constantly increased cost
of government as well as the in
creased cost of living.
Increases in compensation and In
number of employes are to be found
in the estimates of all branches of the
government and to meet this tendency
administration officials have attempt
ed a policy of paring down all pro
posals for new projects with the ex
ception of national defense, expendi
tures to meet the growth of the coun
try and the many burdens thrust upon
the United States by the war.

TWO OLYMPIA CHORCRES
FORM ONE CONGREGATION
Presbyterian and Congregational Join
in Arrangements for United
Churches.
Members of the congregations of
the First Presbyterian and Congrega
tional churches of this city, both of
which have been without pastors for
some weeks, after meetings Wednes
day evening joined in the formation
of the United Churches of Olympia,
and the first services of the new or
ganization will be held next Sunday.
The United Churches will be man
aged by a board of seven trustees,
consisting of the pastor and three
members elected by each church, each
church maintaining its identity,
though a pastor will be called to su
pervise both, and only one church
building will be maintained, union
services being held.
The meeting of the Presbyterian
congregation was presided over by
Rev. Robert H. Mulligan, pastor of
: the Immanuel Presbyterian church of
Tacoma, and the Congregational by
Rev. Frank Dyer, of Tacoma, the lat
ter also presiding over the joint ses
< sion that followed.
Tenino elected the entire People's
ticket in a quiet election last Tues
day, the opposition being offered by
the Socialists. H. C. Barclay was
chosen mayor, Crikker and Axton
councilmen, Claude Vanderslice clerk
and Grace K. Gibbons treasurer.
TIM MICE
ON UUIB PROBLEMS
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
TO ASSIST DEVELOPMENT OF
LOGGED-OFF TRACTS.
Constitutional amendments will be
proposed as necessary aids in the de
velopment of the logged-off lands of
the state at the third logged-off land
conference of legislators, timber men
and others to be held at the Univer
sity of Washington today.
A study of these measures has been
made by a committee consisting of
Austin E. Griffiths, J. H. Easterday,
Judge Frederick Bausman and Dr.
Vanderveer Custis, and the report of
this committee indorses the consti
tutional amendment proposed by the
state tax commission, which provides
for the classification of property for
purposes of taxation.
If the people of the state should
adopt such a plan, It would be pos
sible to exempt from taxation logged
off land during the period of develop
ment, it is urged. In effect, this
would act, it is said, as a bonus on
the part of the state for encouraging
the development of waste land. Sim
ilar action has been taken by a num
ber of the older states, especially of
exempting factory sites for a limited
number of years for the encourage
ment of industries in those states.
Propose State Aid.
Another plan suggested is the use
of the state's credit for agricultural
development. This is expressly for
bidden by the constitution. The re
sult is that Washington alone of all
the states in the Northwest refuses to
aid in the financing of land clearing
and farming.
British Columbia. Idaho, North and
South Dakota and Oregon lend money
to farmers on long time loans at a
low rate of Interest. Oregon at the
recent election adopted an Initiative
law which provides for the use of the
state's credit in making a 12.000.000
loan for the purpose of reloaning the
money to farmers.
Dr. Henry K. Benson, director of
the university bureau of Industrial
research, points out that British
Columbia has $15,000,000 available
for farm loans: Oregon has Invested
more than $6,000,000 in farm mort
gages and at the recent election has
authorized ♦.he use of the state's
credit for borrowing $2,000,000 to
reloan to farmers; Idaho has loaned
its funds to farmers for 26 years
without the loss of a dollar and now
has nearly $3,000,000 outstanding in
farm loans.
Settlers Go Elsewhere.
It is held by many that this state

HEATING PLANT REVIVED
Eastern Concern Seeks Franchise to
Complete Foshay Enterprise.
The Foshay project to erect a cen
tral steam-heating plant here and an
additional electric power plant came
to life again this week when the
American District Steam Heating
company asked the local council to
grant it a 50-year franchise.
When the Foshay enterprises
"blew up," the big Eastern concern
from which Foshay had purchased
his material took over the partially
completed system Foshay had in
stalled, and it now proposes to turn
a dead loss into an active concern.
The proposal is looked upon favor
ably by city officials and will be con
sidered at a special council meeting
next Tuesday evening.
SPECULATE AS 10
MILES' MIMES
ELECTION OF REPUBLICAN CITY
TICKET PROMPTS GOSSIP
AS TO NEW OFFICIALS.
Election of Jesse T. Mills as mayor
and the entire Republican city ticket
except City Clerk W. A. Hoage, the
Cltlens' candidate, who was unop
posed, and J. C. Masemore, the Citi
ens* candidate for councilman in the
Fourth Ward, has produced a lot of
questioning and wondering since the
city election last Tuesday as to the
men whom the mayor-elect would ap
point as chief of police, city engineer,
fire chief and street and waterworks
superintendent, to name the more Im
portant appointive offices at his op
tion.
And so far Mayor-elect Mills hasn't
taken the public Into his confidence
as to the personnel of his appointees,
albeit some of his erstwhile friends
are talking quite freely. They say,
for instance, that W. H. Yeager,
whose term as county engineer ex
pires this month, or the present as
sistant, Ray Wood, or Ernest L.
Wolf is to be city engineer; that
Harry Cusack or Fred W. McCorkle,
whose term as sheriff expires this
month, or Ed Rogers or Jack Berk
shire or Garry Hodge or one of a half
a dozen others. Is to be chief of police.
Weddell and Caton to Go.
The chief speculation is over en
gineer and chief of police, the uni
versal and natural presumption being
that Weddell and Caton are to retire
with the Mottman administration.
Their successors, it Is expected, will
not be announced until the mayor
elect delivers his first message to the
new council at the first meeting in
January, when he is also expected to
announce the chief details of his ad
ministration policy.
The election of the Republican city
ticket followed an unusually quiet
campaign. The majorities ranged
from 288 for City Attorney Bigelow
over R. F. Sturdevant, to Mills* ma
jority of 665 over George N. Talcott,
the Citizens' nominee for mayor.
The vote was as follows: Mayor,
Mills, R., 1,252; Talcott, C., 587;
attorney, Bigelow, R., 1,048; Sturde
vant, C., 757; treasurer, Lona Smith,
R„ 1,534; clerk, Hoage, C., 1,273;
councilman-at-large, McCleary, R..
1123; Bolster, C., 659; councilman,
Second ward, Forstell, R., 87; Ru
dolph, C., 32; Fourth ward, Norrle,
R., 118, Masemore, C., 244; Sixth
ward, Knox, R., 118, Work, C„ 100.
First Under New Uw.
The mayor, attorney, clerk, treas
urer and councilman-at-large were
elected for two-year term» and the
ward councllmen for four years, the
election being the ilrst to be held un
der the biennial election law for
third-class cities, passed by the last
legislature.
The only announcement made by
the mayor-elect is that immediate
steps will be taken to Improve condi
tions on West Fourth street.
Delinquent Taxes Unusually Ix>w.
The smallest number of delinquen

Treasurer Fred W. Stocking regard

| Attend—es at tttr school has bean
good this week. Though not quite
as large as had been expected, it has
been larger than at the last course
given here, while the interest and at
tention have been particularly strong,
exciting the approval of the State
College instructors conducting the
school. A striking feature of the

the Chamber of Commerce, In fact,
has been that those who started with
the first sessions of the course last
Monday have been attending prae
tlcally every day since.
Evening Meetings Large.
The evening meetings in different
communities throughout the county
have been more largely attended.
The first was held at Grand Mound

The program for Friday afternoon
calls for a discussion of "Salads and
Desserts", while Saturday afternoon
the subject will be "Diets for School
Children."
The dally programs as announced
last week for the Agricultural Exten
sion school and the Home Economics
course have been carried out each
