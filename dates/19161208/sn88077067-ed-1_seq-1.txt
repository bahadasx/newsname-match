The wagon still stands at the litt'e
white ouk tree In the McAfee trove par
tially surrounding the house unci barn,
where last Friday' i fatal collision occur
red. The tree Is gashed where a project
ing bolt holding the tongue to the wagon
hounds struck, tearing the tough oaken
fibre as If It were soft material. Where
the tongue-chains scraped the tree the
bark is missing as If lushed by a giant
hand. The wagon-hounds are broken.
The wugonbed is forced backward on the
bolsters till the end of the bed just en

of the tree where the sudden stop threw
Harry from the load of fodder to the

McAfee, was on the scene almost In
stantly and of course did all in his power
to correct the trouble.
The fatality will always be remember
ed as among the saddest In community

TAXATION TIME

Taxing time has come again
You're culled upon to go
And pay your ux once more

So get right III the row.
They tax the man who has a

Some it little, some, some more.
They tax the men v. ho own their

Sometimes enough to cause
alarms.
They tax nan on money too,
This makes rich men feel awful

And taxes on n thresh machine

And taxes on n Ford machine
Are almost as high as OiiHollne

He can hardly keep himself and

If he has tools to earn his bread
They tax him so he can't keep

So much it eats up all the gains.

Why don't they tix some men

dence Irani Rio de Janeiro hi the New

13:
The gr.idu.il change from the export
duty to the land tax It one of the great
issues here. ..It started In the most south
erly State, Rio Grande do Sul, more or
lesu on the Henry Georee slnyletax theo
ry and extended among the most cultiva
ted caUsei of the States of Sao Paulo,
Mlnas Cer.irt, Rio de Janeiro and In the
capital of the republic bearing the same
name.
The Perfect of the metropolis lent a
miage to the Board of Aldermen .ex
plaining In its general lines how the land
t.ix could b gradually Introduced, sup
pressing at the tame time the obnoxious
onet. There are many proauctt that
could have been exported long ago were
It not for the abturd istem of taxation.
Imagine whut a sensation would be
caused In New York. Chicugo, Philadel
phia, Huston, or St. Louis, If the mayor
of any of these cities were to send to the
city council, a message us enlightened
und sensible as that sent by the perfect
of Rio de Junerlo to the local Board of
Aldermen. And imagine the hysterical
dcniincltiilon which would be showered
upon him by the big local dullies. Yet
would it not be well to consider this
'liie.stion- Can the cities of the Cnited
States afford to full behind the cities of
Brazil. In adoption of sensible taxation
methods? Whut servlca huve the landed
interests uerformed. that we should re
ject such reforms to oblige them?

Brewers helped to lick Democrats in In

lick the brewers. Horse apiece is' fair
play. Democrats will Join with drys in
making Indiana dry. urcwers usually
play with Republicans. In Ohio It has
been true. Nearly all restrictions on
Ohio saloons followed Democratic victory.
Wiills was elected Governor same day
county local option was killed Under
Willis Saloons increased. Restrictions
were taken off after republican victory.
Same game has been played in Indiana.
Democrats are mod. They propo.-e to
punish ll iuor men for dealing with repub
Means. In Ohio Willis mc.y try to climb on
dry wagon. Neither wets nor drys trust
him. He flirted with both sides and was
cntght at it He did same with bull
moose and G. O. P. Willis got nig vote
in Cincinnati where drys lost Ohio and
the wets won Home Rule amendment.
Democratic South and West are dry.
Booze is strogest today in strong republi

DIRTY DOLLAR POLITICS
Put Sandles, In Ottawa Sentir.el.l
Who got the money? G. O. P. state
committee admits using n arly $400,000
in Ohio campaign. Average per county
$4,000. What was done with the money?
Did little leaders bet it? If so. then
Democrats have the money. If the G. O.
P. had won what would these little lead
ers have done with the winnings? Either
wuv rank and tile folks get no profits.
If this money bought democratic votes,
let facts be known. Publish name of him
who bought und him wno sold. When the
G. O. P. spends big chunks of money
Democrats should vote their own ticket
straight to keep themselves above sus
picion. Safety first. Perhaps no votes
were bought. Little lenders may be hold
ing the money to spend in 1918 campaign.
The old G O. P. policy was "Favor few.
Tax many."
Whence came this barrel of coin? Is
"New York" the answer? Wall Street
and War munition plants wanted Wilson
beaten, .and Hughes elected. Let Legis
lature dig up facts. Let Ohio see. inside
of l-ntten nolitics. Wash Ohio's honor
free from taint and stain. Punish him or
them who corruut a state.
The fact that dirty dollur politics got
licked in the campaign is no excuse why
those responsible should go unpunisnea.
Hold vhem up to publio gaze.
Mayor Slmnson has found that the City
of Lima can buy all the coal it wants for
Its own use at $2.50 per ton, nut ine same
grade of fuel, to be distributed oy a muni
cipal coal yard, will cost Just $2 more.
Mayor Simnson made this discovery when
he received bids for two thousand tons of
mine-run coal for his proposed city depot.
The city Inst week purchased a thousand
tons of same grade of coal lor its own
use at ? 60. Two mnes of twelve ap
proached offered to furnish the coal at
$4.50 per ton, loaded a, the mines. The
freight to Lima in one case is $1 per ton,
and in the other $1.25. Just why supplies
or coal tor private consumption wuum ue
higher than that for municipal use. Is
something that Mayor Simpson, and most
everybody else, is unable to understand,
unless It' is for the "protection" of the
coal dealer, Wapakoneta Democrat.
