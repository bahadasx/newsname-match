GLAUS DISCOVERED
YULET1DE
The Yoletido season iawith usai-alu.
It is with us, but not .of-u, for much of the earth knows
little of joy today. -
Upon many millions of people the sun shinss a? brightly
as in the days of old, bnt its lustre is dimmed by the shedded .
blood of suffering humanity.
The benign smile of the Divine One i? as tender and as
loving as when the world wa young, bnt the Twentieth Cen
tury finds too many of the human race bent upon pleasnre,
and profit, and revenge, and forgetful of the beauties of life
as f een through eyes that are better and holier tliaa our".
It is with this knowledge that the people of our little
community approach the Yuletide time, when all should bo
sunshine, and gladpess, nn 1 joy.
But if we may not sway tho rest of the world, if our
voice be not heard beyond the couflues of our own firefiies,
we yet may look upward with a feeling of gladness and
thankfulness that the horrors that are engulflug the reft of
the world have at least passed na by.
We miy be thankfdl that we have oven nu hour of peace
and prosperity for qur country, though no one knows when
tho withering hand of the blight nf the century may be
spread over our own fair land.
- Let us be joyful today, but let us mingle that joy with
ounDtssion for the stricken ones of other lands, to whom the
Yohtide season is bnt a mookery and an agonizing delusion.

hicles and Damage thi
Roads
With the cominc of hf 3fnf-
monthswhen people, will be trans
porting agriculturial products to tfce
market, it is thoueht well , that ih
people in general be cautioned about
the weight of load that should be haul
ed over macadam and gravel roads
In order that the roads may not be
badly damaged.
For wagons havinsr tires 2 inches
and less in width not more than 40Q0
pounds including weight of wagon
should be hauled ;
For wagons havine tires 2 1-2 in
ches in width not more than 480O
pounds including weight of wagon
should be hauled;
For wagons havine tires 3 inches
in width a load of 5600 pounds may
be hauled, and
Forjwagons having 4 inch tires
7200 pounds may be hauled.
The following rule mav be used to
calculate the amount that should be
hauled on any wagon, cart, automor
bile truck or any other Vehicle. The:
load should be so limited that the
bearing of the load on each wheei,.
including the weight of the vehicle,
all of which is transmitted through
the axle, shall not exceed 500 pounds
per inch of tire for! t'rw 2. inches in
width or less and for tires in excess of
2 inches in width the limit shall not
exceed 500 pounds per inch wjdth of
tire for 2 inches of width olu 400
pounds forjeach additional inch of
width.
There is no penalty attached to the
weight of the load that may be haul
ed over the- roads, but people should
be public spirited enoueh not to want-
to damage the roads and should' not
ml
T
haul more than the limit' when it is a.
known fact that such action on their
part is rapidly tearing- up the roads. ,
The various counties have' gone to.
considerable expense to nut the rbrdss
in proper condition fof winter traffic
and all county fauthbrities will deeply
tiauic wupciauuu un uic pari ut .
the public using the roads.
