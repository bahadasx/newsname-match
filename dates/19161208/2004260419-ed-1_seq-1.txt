Mason Dlllurd, the firBt to return
from the conference, came directly to
the schoolhoiise. We certulnly were

charms for him. It might possibly
be that the charm doesn't lie in the

Somewhere between Corvallls and

CITIZENS NOMINATE

It BeomB that the selection of F.
C. Hurley at the recent primary In
Astoria Is not to the liking of many
of Astoria's cltizons, for they hold a
mass meeting several days ago and
nomlnnted Geo. Hyland to oppose the
regular nominee. The supporters of
Hylaud claim that while there are
4,000 registered voter In Astoria,
loss tbun 50 per cent of them went
to the polls, therefore they claim
thov are Justified In nominating an
other candidate. Mr. Hyland has
been a resident of ABtorla for some
time und Is a highly respected cltl
sien. The election will be held dur
ing the coming week and a hot fight
Is oxpected, with the chance that
Hylund will be elected.

ii.'islon which was participated in
by the stockholders, their families
and guests. After routine affairs hud

The officers and stockholder were
well pleased with the day' enter
tainment, and each left with the firm
conviction that the co-operative
creamery I all of the succoss which
thoy expected. While not officially
advlstd, the Mist learns from an
authoritative source that the firBt
year's earning will permit the dis
tribution of an 8 per cent dividend
to the stockholders. For the first
year's operation, this Is a remarkably
good record, and with "St. Helens
Ilest" continually gaining popularity
on account of its excellence, the rec
ord for the coming year will un
doubtedly show .a, gain over the flrBt
year's business.

PRESIDENT TARBELL
TENDERS RESIGNATION
Will .No Ijonxer Be Head of Columbia
County Fuir Association.
A. II. Tarboll, who lias so success
fully conducted the affairs of the
Columbia County Fair Association
as its president, this week tendered
his resignation to the county court.,
For tho past seven years Mr. Tarboll
has been at the head of the fair and
has seen it grow from a small grange
fair to a county fair, one which ranks
with the best in Oregon. Other busi
ness matters coming up made it
necessary for Mr. Tarbell to give up
the active management of the fair,
as he did not think he could do jus
tice to bis private business and at
the same time look after the many
details incident to the conduct of the
fair.
As yet the county court has ap
pointed no one to succeed Mr. Tar
bell, although the appointment will
bemade In the near future.
ROLLER SKATING

which no doubt will be appreciated
and patronized by the public. From

soon as they get matters fairly under
way, to offer prizes for the best skat
ers and make some one night of the
three a feature night. At present
only, a piano is used to furnish the
music, but it the patronage permits,
every night or so, an orchestra will
be engaged. The boys of the club
hope to make their hall very attract
ive and comfortable and assure the
public of good floor management.

COURT SUBMITS
EXPENSE BUDGET
Much Money Ite,uired to Run Coun
ty 10 Mill Komi Ivy rroiHised.
Elsewhere in this Issue of the
Mist is published the Columbia coun
ty budget for the ensuing year. As
set forth in the published notice, the
court has Bel December 30, at 1 p. m..
as the date and hour for a public
hearing, which will be In the circuit
court room, and many taXDavers
from all over the county will be
present. By glancing at tho general
fund for roads and highways It will
be noticed that $45,425 is set aside
for this purpose. However, $30,000
of the amount is for sinking fund
and interest on highway bonds and
9,000 Is estimated as surveying ex
penses. As compared with the
amount of road work, to be done,
viz., $127,791, of which 25 per cent,
or $31,947.73, goes Into tho general
road fund for bridges, maintenance,
etc., this amount seems a little ex
cessive. Another item of Interest Is
$5,000 for road supervisors, which,
however, is only half of what is esti
mated as necessary for the care of
the poor, that amount being $9,800.
After deducting for the bridge fund,
it will be noticed that $98,843.27 Is
left to be distributed among the vari
ous road districts. Road District No.
10 has the smallest amount, viz.,
$2,587.05, while District No. 6 gets
$16,882.80.
As we understand the budget, it
may be summarized as follows:
For general fund ex
penses $165,430.00
For road fund 127,791.00
Total to be raised $293,221.00
The court also estimates that
about $8,000 will ho raised from
clerk's fees, sheriff's fees, interest on
bank deposits, etc., so that the total
amount available, should the budget
be ndcpted, will be in excess of $300,
000. Of this amount the county will
have id tend to the state coffers
about $40,000. These are only a few
items of the budget. Read the whole
article carefully co you will be well
informed when ou come to the bud
get meeting. For the convenience of
those wanting , extra copies of tha
proposed budget expenses, the Mist
will run a few extra copies. Call at
the office if you desire any of them.
