CRACKER GUILTY
t/
Is Sentenced to Five Years
Imprisonment
James Donovan, veteran safe
cracker, was found guilty in the
federal court at Coeur d'Alene last
week of blowing the safe ift the
Kendrick postoffice and was sen
tenced to serve a term of five years
in the federal prison at McNeil's
Island. Donovan was arrested in
Spokane as the result of the circu
lation among machine shops of
photographs of the device used to
pull the knob off of the safe.
Following the robbery of the
postoffice safe here, Sheriff Camp
bell traced Donovan and his com
panions, who are now believed to
be two men convicted of safe break
ing in Montana shortly afterwards,
toward Bovill, thru Linden, Park
and Helmer.
Some stamps taken from the safe
and the device used to break into
the safe were found by Donald and
Walter McCrea and were the chief
clues that resulted in the capture
of Donovan.
The federal authorities had
photographs made of the imple
ment used by the robbers, and sent
them to machine shops in all parts
of the northwest. It was found
that the implemeut was made at
the Union Iron Works at Spokane,
and when Donovan returned to get
another, he was identified and ar
rested.
His photograph was recognized
by Mrs. Weaver, at whose house
above Kendrick he and his compan
ions stopped for breakfast, and at
the trial he was identified by Mrs.
Weaver and by Pat Malone^ who
ran Donovan and two companions
out of Bovill a week before the
Kendrick robbery.
Donovan was identified by Bertil
lon Expert Wesley Turner as an es
caped convict. He was convicted
of blowing two postoffice safes in
North Dakota, but escaped from
the county jail in that place before
he could be taken to the peniten
tiary.
Sheriff Alverson of North Dakota
was present at the trial in Coeur
d'Alene, ready to take Donovan
back should the jury find him not
guilty. Donovan will have to serve
his time in North Dakota after he
completes his sentence for blowing
the Kendrick safe.
Legislature Meets Week Late
For the first time in the history
of the state, in 1917, the legislature
will not be inaugurated on the
same day as state officials. This
À* due to the fact that the first Mon
day in January 1917, happens to be
January 1. On Monday, January 1,
state officials-elect will upon taking
their oaths ot office and filing
them with the secretary of state,
automatically come into possession
of the office to which they have
been elected and those whom they
succeed will as automatically retire
from office. The customary cere
mony of swearing in state officials
before the legislature convenes.
That body does not take office and
organize until January 8.
The constitution sets forth that
state officials shall hold office "for
two years beginning on the first
Monday in January" after their
election, while another section re
garding the convening of the legis
lature shall be held biennially
"commencing on the first Monday
after the fir6t day of Jan
uary." January 1, 1917, falling on
Monday, the legislature, therefore,
does not meet until a week later.—

The above program and enter
tainment will be given at the high
school auditorium Friday evening,
December 15, for the benefit of the
athletic and music interests of the
school. The income feature of the
evening is probably new in this
vicinity. Instead of the proverbial
"box-supper" or "pie-supper," a
"sock-feed" is instituted. The
ladies, instead of making a box and
filling it with edibles, fill a gentle- ]
man's sock with edibles. The lady
puts a card with her own name into
the other sock of the pair, and
marks both with an insignia (she
should be sure to have the insignia
the same on the two.) The gentle
man buys the filled sock, and finds
his supper partner by identifying
the mate to it. Then they eat.
The Kendrick high school basket
ball team was defeated here a few
days ago by the team of the Lewis
ton Normal, by a score of forty
nine to twenty-nine. This shows an
improvement over the score of the
former game, when the score was
forty to sixteen. The Kendrick
team is thinking of getting another
game with the Normal, and believes
that a still better showing can be
made.
Last week the skating, though of
short duration, Was much enjoyed.
Miss Long's pupils are very much
interested in preparing Christmas
gifts.
Lucile Davis has returned to
school after an abscence of several
weeks.
Miss Mellison has returned to her
work this week, much to the de
light of her pnpils.
The recess periods have been
used by the grades this week in
gymnasium exercises.
Death of Gerald Janes
Gerald Weston Janes, the little
son of Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Janes,
who live between Kendrick and
Juliaetta, died last Friday. For
some time he had been quite ill
with scarlet fever and this devel
oped into diptheria which caused
his death. He was four years old
the fifteenth of last December. Rev.
Emmel conducted the funeral ser
vice. The burial took place in the
Kendrick cemetery Saturday morn
ing. Much sympathy is felt for
the members of the family in their
bereavement.
Criterion Glee Club Pleases
The concert by the Criterion Glee
Club Tuesday night was attended
by a large audience of music lovers
who went with the expectation of
hearing a musical program of merit.
Their expectations were more than
realized in the selections rendered
by the quartet, each one of the
four having a solo voice of unusual
merit. Their voices were strong
and blended beautifully, every se
lection rendered by them giving
pleasure to the audience. Encores
were frequent and hearty applause
given every number. .
The program was varied. Solos,
duets, quartet work, readings and
instrumental music made the entire
entertainment one df unusual at
tractiveness. Classical selections,
sacred music and popular songs
were rendered in such a manner
that the different tastes of the in
dividuals in the audience were sat
isfied.
The next number of the course
will be the home talent production
by the High School, which will pro
bably be given the latter part of
January.

Emmett-Porter
Last Saturday evening the James
Emmett home was the scene of a
very pretty wedding when Miss
Mabel Emmett and Mr. Rud Porter
were united in marriage. The
ceremony was performed at six
o'clock by Rev. Emmel. Miss Em
mett, sister of the bride, played
the wedding march and during the
reading of the ceremony subdued
music was played. ' Lights furnish
ed by candles and the open fire
place cast a soft glow over the
room and added to the solemnity of
the occasion.
The bride was charmingly dressed
in a white satin messalian gown.
Beautiful bridal roses, tastefully
arranged, furnished the decoration
for the room.
After hearty congratulations a
five course dinner was served to the
following guests: Mr. and Mrs.
Glen Porter, Mr. and Mrs. Ed
Long, Mr. and Mrs. Emmel, Miss
Dammerall.

School district No. 7, known as
the Rimrock district, with Miss
Emma C. Anderson teacher, estab
lished a new record for getting
funds by conducting a social when
on last Wednesday evening $142.20
was realized from a box-social.
The money will be expended to im
prove the facilities at the school.

Latah County Spelling Match
There is to be a round-up of the
best spellers in Latah county in
Moscow in March. Miss Bryden,
superintendent of schools, has
launched the movement and no
doubt it will be carried through by
her successor, Miss Calkins.
All the schools of the county are
to be given an opportunity to enter
this contest. Preliminaries will be
held in the various schools; then
the county is to be divided into
nine district contests with Geneseç,
Moscow, Troy, Kendrick, Potlatch,
Harvard or Princeton, Deary, Bo
vill and Juliaetta as the centers.
Winners in the district contests
will enter the final contest in Mos
cow in March. Medals will be a
warded to the winners here.
It is expected that great interest
will be worked up in the schools
over these contests. The real ob
ject on the part of the educators is
to improve the spelling of the chil
dren. The spelling will be both
oral and written, 25 words in the
former and 100 in the latter.—Post

Ml HIGHWAY
BONDS TOTED
$150.000 To Be Used For
Permanent Roads
The voters of the Lapwai Valley
Highway district Monday, author
ized the issuance of bonds in the
sum of $150,000 for the permanent
improvement of the highways by
the overwhelming vote of 436 to
135.
The voting of the bonds will
mean that the Lapwai Valley 'High-
way district will be prepared to
join with the state in the matter of
locating and constructing the north
and south state highway through
the Lapwai valiey. The commis-
sioners of the Lapwai district will
soon take up the matter with the
state commissirn with a view of
having the work commenced on the
Lapwai valley link of the state
highway as early in the new year as
weather conditions will permit.
There is perhaps no sections in
the northwest where the movement
for permanent highway construc-
tion has received greater impetus
that the western portion of Nez
Peree ;onnty. The bonds voted
make a total of $500,000 provided
for permanent highway construct
ion within a radius of 15 miles.
The Lewiston Orchards was the first
highway district to build the per
manent roads and during the sum
mer of 1916 expended $100,000 in
the building of a paved highway
from the Lewiston boundary thru
the planted areas of the district.
The Waha-Tammany district voted
$100,000 to extend the highway
from Lewiston Orchads to Waha
and the Lewiston highway district
is now expending $150,000 in ex
tending the permanent from the
city limits on the north to the
Idaho-Washington state line be
tween Lewiston and Uniontown.
The Lapwai district will expend
the $150.000 voted in the construc
tion of a permanent highway from
Culdesac to Spalding and in im
proving the lateral highways of the
district. The money will be equit
ably expended throughout the dis
trict so that all sections will be
equally benefited by the improve
ments.
Another move for better high
ways in Nez Perce county was re
cently inaugurated when the Clear
water highway district was created
to construct a modern highway
from the Clearwater county line
above Peck to a point on the north
bank of the Clearwater river oppo
site Spalding. Sentiment through
out the county appears to favor a
county bond issue to construct
bridges across the Clearwater river
at points where such crossings are
needed. It is expected four or five
bridges in addition to the structure
at Lewiston will be needed to serve
the county and with these in place
practically all sections of the coun
tp will be served by modern high
ways.
Do It Now
The Gazette has just finished pay
ing for a small jag of paper to tide
over until spring. The paper houses
have to have their money but the
publisher has to wait for his until
the subscriber takes a notion to pay
up. Subscribers should realize the
difficulties under which the publisn
ers are working and should make it
a point to pay up promptly. V ith
taper prices much more than d table

tion prices the same as ever, a
