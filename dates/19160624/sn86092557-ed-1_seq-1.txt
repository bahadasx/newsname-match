Raw Weather And Lack of
Sunshine Brings on
Colds.
Although the average temperature
for June for the past twenty-five
years 1b 69.8 degrees, the present
month is likely to be recorded as the
coldest in all that period. Unless
the weather suddenly turns hot for
the remainder of the month the local
weather prophets have estimated
that June, 1916, will be remembered
as even colder than June, 1903,
which was the coldest of this period
or the Junes of 1912 and 1913
which were also unseasonably cold
months.
The lowest temperature ever re
corded In West Virginia In June oc
curred In 1912 and 1913, when a
drop during the night to 29 degrees
brought destructive and blighting
frosts that were especially damaging
to fruit and many garden cropB. The
lowest temperature for June of 19IB
was 33 degrees recorded at Bayard
on June 24.
The highest June temperature re
corded in West Virginia during the
past twenty-five years is 104 degreei
and it occurred in 1901. In 1914
the mercury reached 100. The high
est temperature recorded*" last" year
was 95 degrees registered at Romney
June 13.
In fact the extremes of tempera
tures for West Virginia In most any
month of the year are to be found
in the pan handle section of the
state. Nearly all of the frost and
hail that occured last June was ob-!
served chiefly in that section. TUo
average June sunshine :s only 68 perl
cent of the possible amount and last
year was only 51 per cent. This
year it will likely run less than 45
per cent as the month has been one
of the most cloudy ever observed.
The damp cloudy weather of the
past two weeks is almost wholly re
sponsible for the tremendous and
spread of an epidemic of colds and
nasal Infections to which hay fever
victims are peculiarly susceptible.
Physicians say that such an epidemic
always accompanies prolonged damp
and cold weather in the spring time,
but that It seems to be more wide
spread this season than for many
years heretofore.
Seven Are Anxious
To Carry Rural Mail
.Seven applicants today took exam
ination this morning for rural mall
carrier'at Hammond and vacancies
that may occur later. The examina

Seventy Five Thousand Bonus
Vote Offer Will Expire Tonight
Tonight will mark the close of the
big bonus offer In the West Virginian
Seven Thousand Club. To secure the
? Seventy-Five Thousand Bonus votes
with each club of eight subscriptions <
toi one year, you must act at once.
Delay In this case will prove costly
to all members of the club, for these
* special vote ballots will have much to
do In determining who will stand high,
est at the close of the race. And the
j major portion of tho $3,200 in prizes
will g? to these people.
Many Hustlers.
| The Seven Thousand Club boasts
| many hustlers in the territory covered
by the West Virginian. Some, of
course, are doing better than others,
tin securing more subscriptions, and
consequently, securing more votes, but
it Is within the powor of everyone
whose name now appears on the list
of workers to turn the tables com
pletely between this and July 8. The
member who stands lowest today may
bo the first member of the club tomor
row. The candidate whose efforts seem
to count for little now may carry off
Overland six cylinder car at
?the close of the race. There are two
big weeks ahead before tbe cam
closes, and' it Is still possible for
Pkinflw m&iber^to enter the contest
and win the highest pi*"* eft by
re*"1-"
Build a Reserve Vote.
Some of you may believe that the
Seven Thousand Club department has
been telling you these wonderful op
portunities simply because it will prof
it the West Virginian if you put forth
your best effort now. Such is not the
case. There are many big awards to
bo distributed and in addition all ac
tive members who fail to receive a
prize will be paid a big cash commit*
sion on all new subscriptions which
they turn in at this office. But you
should set your heart oh the automo
bile or one of the other valuable
awards. They are the kind of things
t!?at peple work hard to obtain, the
good things of life'. You can win
them if you make up your mind to
get busy now and create a big reserve
vote for use at the closo of the cam
paign. If you do this you will be
one of the happiest persons in the
world when you see your name in the
winning list on July 8.
Resolve to Succeed.
Do not feel blue whenever you run
across a snag In your efforts to se
cure votes. The very fact that you
are going to win prizes worth more
than the ordinary man can save up
for years to come, makes other peo
ple envious. And when folks are en
vious, they knock. Don't let these
folks make an impression upon you.

TRACTION CO. TO
New Plant Is In Course of
Construction on Dunkard
Creek.
Officials of the Monongahela Valley
Inaction company announced today
that work was begun this week on
their new gasoline condensing plant
which Is to be built on Dunkard Creek.
The new plant will have a capacity of
between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons ot
gasoline per day.
The plant when completed will cost
about $25,000 and etaploy about five
men.
This condensing process whereby
gasoline is made frpm gas Is the samo
that Is practiced by other gas co's
of West Virginia and produces a high
grade of gasoline. The light casing
head gasoline and the heavier gasoline
produced by compression of ordinary
West Virginia Qag are blended together
so that the proper specific gravity is
secured before the product is market

Again in Hospital
Judge W. S. Haymond, who recently
again underwent an operation for the
removal of a carbuncle is still in Cook
hospital but recovering rapidly. This
latest operation was for the removal
of a carbuncle over the right eyes.
The weak condition and low resistance
o fthe Judge caused the physicians to
fear that unlesB this carbuncle was
remove! it might spread through the
lymphatic glands in the patients face
and thus become very dangerous.
It Is probable that Judge Haymond
will not be able to leave the hopital
for a week. He had been preparing
to a trip to Battle Crfcek, Mich.,
where he hoped to rest and recover
from the effects of the long seige of
carbuncles that he has undergone,
when this last one suddenly began to
Bpread Thursday evening and made
the operation necessary.

(By Associated Pre**)
SAN ANTONIO, June 24.?In the
shadow of the Alamo where the
deaths of Davy Crockett, James
Bowie, Col. Travis and Col. Bonham
made history 70 years ago, citizens
of San Antonio today were convinced
that another Alamo was fought last
Wednesday at Carrizal by Captain
Charles L. Boyd's troopers of the
Tenth cavalry, and that the names of
Captains Boyd and Morey and Lieut.
Adair would go down into history
with those of their Illustrious prede
cessors.
Officers and southern division
headquarters still hope that a com
plete and official report from Oen.
Pershing would show that more than
the seven men who have reached the
main column have escaped death,
wounds or capture. Yet none dis
putes that the fragmentary reports
show that the plight of the little
band of Americans must have been
desperate.
According to these reports they
were lured to their death by pretense
of a parley. The Atnericanr were
nearly 80 miles from the nearest
chance of aid surrounded by a tre
mendously superior force. While en
deavoring to avoid a clash they were
swept by machine guns and rifle fire.

By Associated Press.
CHIHUAHUA, June 24.?American columns have been seen a
vancing from the American field base in the direction of San Antonio i'al
Oj Caliente, and General Jacinto Trevino has issued orders to attack &<?jrjg
if they do net immediately retreat
Gen. Trevino said the Americans would get the same treatment th
they received at Carrizal, as he is determined to carry out his orders tojtl
ie"...\ In this he said he had all his subordinates with him and they W
rcmnin with him in case of rupture.
The Mexican commander said that it seemed probable, inasmuch 1
General Pershing seems ignorant of the fate of the Boyd column, thatfoup|
side of five additional prisoners now being brough here, the Americans \
annihilated, although it was possible more had escaped.
General Pershing has wired here for names of dead and prisoners. It
was officially announced that none of the prisoners brought in will behangpll

4 here. The prisoners were assaulted by Mexican civilians as they were
being transferred from the train to the penitentiary. _
According to the authorities they are being well treated. The troopers
brought here are Privates Page, Peterson, N. Lloyd, W. Ward, Jones,'
i Sockes, Marshall, Oliver, McDonald, Williams, Givcns, Stone, Harris, Lee
and Graham of troop H and Howe and Alexander of troop C.
According to the statement said to have been signed by Spillsbiuy
made public today by Gen. Trevino, neither he nor the negroes knew whia
side began the firing. Spillsbury*s statement says that practically all the
Americans who lost their lives were killed when they advanced to ijj deep ?
ditch in which Mexicans were stationed and .when other Mexicans getting
around to a deep ditch in the rear, attacked them on the flank. ?
FORTY TROOPERS MISSING.
COLUMBUS, N. M., June 24.?All of the American force which
engaged the Mexicans at Carrizal have returned to the field'base excepting ,
Captains Boyd and Morey, Lieutenant Adair and 40 troopers, according, to 7;if
a report brought here today by arrivals from the interior.
The three officers are believed dead.
According to this report the total of American dead in battle probably
wu 26 unless some of the troops still are wandering in search of the expe
ditionary force. Seventeen prisoners have been taken to Chihuahua Cijjr.
Mexican reports that 12 American dead were found on the scene of the en
gagement would indicate, if the latest details are correct, that 14 trpopen
cither died from wounds, were killed in later fighting, or have not succeeded
in reaching the base.
