proposal to authorize the presi
dent to draft members of the na
val militia in time of emergency

Much Enthusiasm.
Today's reports that more battle
ships had been ordered to Mexican
waters found the Bemidji militia
boys preparing for a call There is
much enthusiasm among the men. A
number of the men remained at the
city hall all day and reports given
them by the Pioneer on Mexican de

To Training Camp.
Should a mobilization call be is
sued the men will go to Duluth, from
which point they will be transferred
to the Great Lakes, 111, training sta

and placed aboard a war vessel.
No Transfers.
"Not one of the men desire to
transfer their enlistment from the
naval militia to the land forces,"
said Lieut Barker this morning in
reply to the following message re
ceived this morning by Governor
Burnquist from Secretary of the Navy
Daniels:
"Department learns that there is
a desire of certain naval militia en
listed men to join the militia (land
forces I urge that you reduce such
transfers to the minimum The naval
militia is trained at a gre&t expense
to the Federal government for naval
purposes and thi= force should be
kept intact."
Several Enlist.
Several enlistments were made vol
untarily to the Bemidji naval militia
THE BEMIDJI
today. Several other men have signi
fied their intentions of joining late
today or tomorrow.
Reports were circulated yesterday
that the old Company K, Bemidji
boys, had never been mustered out
and that the men would be called for
service This-report
is unfounded as
the Bemidji Company was mustered
out and transferred to Stillwater.
A United Press representative of
the Pioneer interviewed Adj. Gen
eral Wood at the state capitol yes
terday on the matter.
"It would be impossible to call out
the Bemidji men who were members
of Company K," said General Wood.
"That company was transferred to
Stillwater and the Stillwater contin
gent is at present at Fort Snelling."

Rotterdam, May 29 (By mail)
Nobody ever has anything fried these
days in German cities and towns un
less a special feast is on and the
householder or host has had a re
markable piece of luck in securing
fat of some kind Fats of every kind
are lacking.
Travelers from Germany to Rotter
dam say butter is practically un
known. Now and then a household
er may secure a half a pound of mar
garine at a dollar a pound
Lard is as scarce as butter
Use Olive Oil.
Some months ago, when the short
age in fats became definite, a few
good cooks discovered that olive oil
might be used in frying meats and
within a short time many foresighted
civilians had laid in supplies of olive
oil. At present the olive oil supply
is exhausted.
The government experts in their
efforts to obtain fats, commandeered
all the peanuts in Germany.
"I'm very fond of peanut candy,"
said a German from Munich who had
come to Rotterdam to feed up, as he
explained, "and every afternoon I
used to drop a few pennies in a
penny-in-the-slot candy machine near
my office.
"One afternoon I ran out to the
machine and found that the peanut
candy slot had been sealed up with
a government seal.
"I couldn't break it, of course.
Later on a policeman came and col
lected all the peanut candy in the
machine. He said the government
was going to take the peanuts out pf
it and extract the oil from them."
Get French Sardine.
The one greasy food that can be
obtained in limited quantities in cer
tain districts of Germany is the little
French canned sardine. How it gets
into Germany no one seems to know.
"My grocer always had some sar
dines," explained a neutral lady, who
was going back to the United States,
"where I can eat all I want to." He
doled them out sparingly without any
government regulation, she said, but
a beefsteak fried in the fish oil was
very unlike a beefsteak.
There has never been a shortage
of lemons and oranges, according to
various persons from various parts
of Germany. The ally blockade, it
appears, has not as yet shut off the
supply of citrus fruits, which reach
Germany by devious routes from
various warm climes.
Of sugar the Germans, of course,
have an immense supply, owing to
their best root industry. Salt
abounds but pepper is scarce. Ham,
bacon or pork in farm is unknown
to civilians.
Hens Valuable.
Eggs in April were sixty cents a
dozen and laying hens were so valu
able that no chickens were killed for
food until their laying capacity de
clined.
A dressed chicken in a Cologne
shop brought two dollars and a half

AT FORT SNELLING
Indications are That All Companies
Will Be Mobilized at St. Paul
Station Monday.
FULL PEACE STRENGTH TO
BE REACHES TOMORROW
Governor Burnquist t& Review Troops
at State Capitol Tomorrow
Afternoon.
St Paul, Minn., June 24."Mobili-
zation of the Stillwater and Winona
companies does not necessarily mean
the general state mobilization of the
Minnesota National Guard," Adj
Gen B. Wood told the United Press
today. "These companies were call
ed to Fort Snelling merely to do camp
work We have absolutely no idea
as to when the remainder of the
state guard will be ordered to mobi
lize
"It is probable, however, that all
the infantry may be camped at Fort
Snelling Monday. Present indica
tions are that a full peace strength
ill be reached Sunday.
A Gala Day.
It's to be a gala day at Fort Snell
ing, for tomorrow, according to plans
today Hundreds of visitors are ex
pected to throng the fort's grounds
during the day At 5 o'clock to
morrow afternoon the governor and
his party on the steps of the state
capitol "will review the regiments
while the First Battalion band plays
martial strains.
When Brig. Gen. A. W. Wright,
Austin, arrived at Fort Snelling today
to take charge of the Minnesota Na
tional Guard, he found little but
work mobilized. Of this he found
plenty. He will help Adj. Gen. Wood
make preliminary arrangements for
getting the guard in shape, anticipa
ting, as they do, an early call to the
border.
Trouble With Horses.
Those horses, more accustomed,
perhaps, to dragging a plow than
dragging a machine gun, simply can't
be broke into martial tricks. The
boys are having a lot of trouble with
them. Battery especially cursed,
it seems, with balky horses, have been
holding three-hour conferences on
how to make a horse quit kicking.
Some law abiding soldier produced a
manual of arms to guide the horse.
Another substituted the suggestion
that a manual of legs would be bet
ter. When one of these nags starts
a bombardment with his rear legs
the soldiers always retreat in some
disorder.
No Naval Orders.
"Please tell the people of Minne
sota that a member of the national
guard is a soldier, is subject to duty
in time of war, and I have no auth
ority to let them off. Neither has
Governor Burnquist. If they know
this, maybe we'll have more time for
military duties," Adj. Gen. Wood
said today.
Orders affecting the Minnesota na
val militia had not been received up
to early today, officials insisted.

MEXICAN SNIPERS BUSY ON RIO GRANDE
GENERAL BELL THREATENS TO TAKE JUAREZ
(By United Press)
Washington, June 24.President Wilson, Secretary Lansing and Sec-
retary Baker held a long conference today. They admitted that they
were unable to fix the blame as yet for the Carrizal battle.
The question of armed intervention of Mexico rests squarely upon
the report of any of the commissioned officers of Boyd's detachment, if
any of them are living. Boyd had exclusive orders to confine his opera-
tions to scouting and not to fight. If Boyd advanced despite Gomez's or-
ders he violated orders. If he was fired upon when he stopped, Wilson's
threat of "gravest consequence" will be made good. No action will be
taken on the word of the colored troops
Troops Wiped Out.
San Antonio, June 2"4.The two
troops of the Tenth cavalry, under
Captain Charles T. Boyd, practically
were wiped out by the attack of Mex
ican forces under General Gomez at
Carrizal, June 21, according to indi
cations given in a fragmentary re
port erceived by General Funston
from General Pershing last night
General Pershing's message stated
that seven survivors, including those
who arrived last night, have reached
the main column All were enlisted
men, but the report did not say
whether there were non-commissioned
officers among them.
Caught in Flank.
According to the -stories of the
survivors, as outlined in General Per
shing's report, a mounted force of
Mexicans made a charge from the
flank at the conclusion of a parley
between Captain Boyd and General
Gomez, at the same time that a ma
chine gun opened fire from the front
as General Gomez reached his line.
Captain Boyd had ordered his men
to dismount as the machine gun op
ened fire, and a combined effect of
the Mexican charge, the machine gun
fire and the rifle fire from the Mexi
can garrison of Carrizal, which had
almost surrounded the little Amer
ican force, under cover of the parley
sought by General Gomez to discuss
whether Captain Boyd should be al
lowed to pass through the town,
Stampeded the horses. No details were
made known to General Pershing as
to whether the Mexican charge was
checked
Ringed by Fire.
With their mounts gone, caught
without means of escape, ringed about
on three sides with the fire of an over
whelming force, the fate of the little
detachment is believed by officers
here to have been sealed. It is fear
ed that only the most stupendous
luck, and that by desperate valor,
could have extricated Captain Boyd's
men from the trap.
The reports from Mexican forces
place the number killed, including
two officers, at from 12 to 40. It
is reported 17 were taken captive in
to Chihuahua City.
Officers Active.
Mexico City, June 24.Military
officers are very active here.
Refugees at Vera Cruz.
Vera Cruz, June 24.Six hundred
and fifty refugees are here awaiting
transportation to the United States.
A special train brought scores here
this morning. It is reported that
many Americans in the interior cities
are refusing to leave their homes.
Argentina Declines.
Buenos Ayres, June 24.Argentina
will positively decline Chili's sug
gestion that all the South American
governments intervene to prevent war
between Mexico and the United
States.
Resolution Fails.
Washington, June 24.Senator
Reed's introduced resolution for the
pay of militia men to be $30 per
month, started a hot debate this
morning. The resolution failed.
Washington, June 24.High offl-
"HOP
cials today stated that it would be
impossible to consider the Pope's
mediation or arbitration plans now.
Spain to Mediate.
Rome, June 24.The Pope in
lengthy conferences with ambassa
dors thought that Spanish King Al
fonso would mediate the United
Slates and Mexican situation.
Militias are Rready.
Washington, June 24.The mili
tias of Wisconsin, Kansas and Mis
souri today reported that they had
recruited sufficient strength and in
dicated in their dispatches that they
would either go south today or to
morrow.
Hopes Up to Squadron.
El Paso, June 24.All hopes to
secure exact tidings from the hun
dred troopers ambushed at Carrizal
rests with the relief squadron of the
Eleventh cavalry which General Per
shing sent immediately after the Car
rizal battle. Failure to receive word
is itself sinister.
Would Take Railways.
Columbus, June 24 War talk to
day advanced the probability of the
abandoning of the Columbus base. If
war is started it is believed that the
first step will be a great rush to seize
the railways.
May Have Been Killed*/
El Paso, June 24.The fate Q|
sixty men reported escaped from the
Carrizal ambush is unknown. It is
likely that the Mexican cavalry ran
them down on the desert and killed
them or that they died from lack of
water Officials say war is inevi
table.
Hope Vanished.
Washington, June 24.Hope has
officially vanished that over a hand
ful of Americans escaped execution
in the Carrizal ambush.
Will Release Men.

Rogers of Mexico City today wired
that Carranza had promised to re
lease the 50 Americans detained in
the Guanajata colony.
Snipers are Busy.
&

women and children to leave Juarez
anticipating fighting General BelVa
forces.
Has Million Men.
New York, June 24.The Mexican
consulate here announced yesterday
that 1,000,000 men had offered their
services against the United States.
Washington, June 24.Legislative
approval of President Wilson's use of
the national guard in Mexico in the
Mexican crisis was voted almost un
animously by the house late yester
day in adopting a resolution declar
ing the existence of an emergency
and giving the president a free hand
to draft as federal soldiers all guards
men willing to take the required oath.
The senate is expected to concur to
morrow.
A million dollars would be appro
priated by the resolutions to aid de
pendent families of the guardsmen so
drafted.

to the war department with the re
striction that no family shall receive
more than $50 a month. &!
Columbus, June 24.General Per
shing's final report of the Carrizal
incident upon which may hinge peace
or war is expected hourly. All sur
vivors of the fight and the cavalry
column sent to their relief have re
turned to the Dublan base. The miss-1?
ing men from the two troops of the
Tenth attacked at Carrizal reported
included 40 men and a majority of
the commissioned officers. The first
official Mexican statement on the af
fair said that 40 Americans were
killed.
