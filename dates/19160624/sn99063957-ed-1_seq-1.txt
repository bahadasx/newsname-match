BOYD ORDERED NOT TO

Return of Relief Expedition
May Throw Light On How
Fight Started
By Robert J. Bender.
(Tinted Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, June 24 The question
of an arnied invasion of Mexico hangs
today upon "the nature of the first re
port" of any commissioned officer who
participated in the Carrizal 'fight it any
are alive.
Following a conference with Presi
dent Wilson, lasting ono hour, Secretary
of War Baker at 11 o'clock today said:
"We are obliged to wait for further
word from General Pcrshiug before we
can determine our course of action."
"The only thing we have thus far,
nside from that coming from Mexican
cources, is the report of a few stragglers
who were considerably in tae rear 01
(he point where the Carrizal attack oc
curred." Baker said.
The men had been left to hold the
borses and act as a rear guard, while
, tlie others went forward. Apparently
when the firing started and our horses
licgan to stampede, these men scamper
ed away, so that they were, not near
the place where the parleying was
going on and probably were consider
: ably back when the shooting began.
"We are compelled to wait, there
fore," he said, "until we hear from the
' two troops of cavalry sent out to bring
back what remains of the troops en
gaged in the Carrizal fight. Until we
i;ct that report, there is absolutely no
change in policy to be considered.
"The public, will uot have to wait
five minutes for the contents of Gen
or Pershing's report when it comes
in," Baker said.
Boyd's Orders Were Strict.
The forces under Captain Boyd were
under explicit- orders from General
Pershing to confine their operations ex
clusively to scouting. They were spe
cifically commanded to engage ill no
fight, or to make no move which threat
ened to precipitate a fight, unless ac
tually attacked. If Boyd was com
manded to stop or refused permission
to pass by General Gomez and advanced
regardless, he violated his orders and
there will be no declaration of war be
cause of the Carrizal incident.
If the reports made so far by the
escaped negro troops of the T?nth cav
r.lry tli it t. Captain Boyd had stopped his
inarch at the command of Gomez and
that the Mexicans 'fired on the troopers
sifter they had halted are confirmed by
un officer, President Wilson's threat of
the "gravest consequences" will at
once be made good- Action is not to
Ue taken on the word of the colored
troopers because it is realized the en
listed men had no part in the parley be
tween Gomez and Boyd and could
narcelv have been familiar with all the
details. '
There is no minimizing of the serious
ness of the situation at either the White
Bouse or the war department. It is ad
mitted that the likelihood of a break
luis never been so great.
Moray's Story Will Decide It.
The effect has been sobering. There
in little disposition to talk at either the
White House or the war department.
Both departments are keyed for ac
It'on. At both places it is admitted

The mustenng in of militiamen pro
ceeded slowly today. After taking the
federal oath, members of Company M
of Salem were given the physical ex
amination while other companies of the
Third battalion were mustered in.
Rifles, ammunition and quartermas
ter's supplies are en route here from
California arsenals. Until they arrive
the militiamen cannot be passed by the
United States army as "reasonably fit
for field service."
It may be a week before any of the
Oregon troops can be sent forward,
said Captain Kenneth 1 Williams, mus-tering-in
officer.
Very few men of the Salem company
failed to pass any of the federal tests,
but because of the size of this com
panyabout 150 men some of them
may be assigned to other companies to
make up shortages.
About 100 militiamen whose enlist
ments expire in July have refused to
re-enlist and have been sent home.
Five Burned to Death-Mex
icans Accused of Starting
Fire-Loss $100,009
Needles, C'al., June 24 With the
business section of Needles reduced to
smouldering ruins today and five per
sons dead as a result of a fire which
swept the city before daylight todav.
officers have been rushed from neigh
boring cities to prevent a pitched bat-
tle between Americans and Mexican
residents here.
Mexicans are openly accused on all
sides of being responsible for the blaze
which broke out in the Needles hotel
at 1:15 a. m. and spread rapidly across
the business section. The loss is esti
mated at between $75,000 and $100,000.
A riot here Monday, in which three
Mexicans were wounded and which re
sulted from the killing of a Mexican
by a white peace officer, is said to
have kindled'a feeling that hu. grown
steadily during the week.
Nick Jassress, wealthy mine owner,
is only known of the five victims. The
other victims were strangers here and
their identity for the time being is a
mystery, owing to the destruction of
the hotel registers.
In all 15 large establishments, in
cluding one hotel, two meat markets.
grocery stores, a garage, office block
and two restaurants were destroyed.
When the fire broke out in the
Needles hotel 18 persons were sleeping
within. Jussress rushed to the front

Mexico City, June 24. Secretary
COMING GCINFLICT
Lansing's statement to the Latin-AmerJ the local boys, declares Mr. Putnnm
..... . X' n; . 1 1 t.l I. l
ican diplomats has caused an excellent
impression here. It is now believed in
official circles that the prospects for a
peaceful solution of the present diffi
culties between the United States and
Mexico are promising,
Mexican military officials, however,
are displaying great activity in view of
the prospects ot war with the United
States. They have been on the move
day and night since the situation be
came critical, though the city is quiet
so far as the civilion population is con
cerned. "
General Carranza was in consultation
with his ministers until a late hour last
night. The reply to President Wilson's
note was the chief topic of discussion.
All tho leading officials refused to talk
for publication, though tho general sen
timent is that the note is unduly antag
onistic and that some portions are based
on a misunderstanding of the facts.
There are no indications when Gen
eral .Carranza 'g reply will be sent t
Washington, Ofiicials declare posi
tively, however, that do intimation of
its contents 'Will be permitted to be
cabled or to be published here until aft
er it is received and published in full
in the United States. .
The American government is being
criticised because New York newsoa-
fpers printed a synopsis of President
Wilson s note a week before its receipt
here.
Little public interest is being shown
in the note, which has not been publish
ed here. It is the general belief, how
ever, that General Carranza, in his re
ply, will combat vigorously some of
President Wilson's statements, especial
ly the one alleging the presence of con
stitutionalist troops among bandit raid
ers. Telegraph wires from all parts of the
republic are bringing assurances of sup
port to General Carranza in case of
hostilities with the United States. Of
ficials believe the proclamation of amn
esty issued Thursday will unite all fac
tions of any consequence in the country
in opposition to any invading army.

cerned, tonight.
In yesterday's test Fred Thielsen and
Floyd I.. Utter failed to qualify and

Clifford Brown' and Arthur Reinhart

sence and John and Allan Carson will

The Austrinns evacuated Kuty, a

More than two thirds of thn Austrian
crown land of Bukowina is now in the
