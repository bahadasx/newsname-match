CHIHUAHUA CITY,' June 24. American columns were seen, advanc
ing from American base in the direction of San Antonio and Ojo Cajiente.
General Trevino has ordered an attack if they don't immediately retreat.
He said the Americans would get the same treatment as at Carrizal, as he '
is determined to carry out his orders to the letter.
According to a statement alleged to have been signed by Eem Spill
bury, the Mormon scout captured at Carrizal, neither he or the negroes of
the Tenth cavalry knew which side started fire first. The statement says
practically all the Americans were killed when part of the Mexican force
got in the rear and began attacking on the flank. -
ABOUT TO BREAK
WASHINGTON, June 24 Friendly relations betwen the United.
States and Mexico are close to the breaking point, as the result of well
founded belief that two troops of American cavalry were deliberately mas
sacred by Carranza troops. Secretary Lansing, Secretary Baker and Presi
dent Wilson conferred this morning. It is known that the. possibility of
, taking drastic action against the Mexicans in Chihuahua was considered
gravely. Secretary Baker and Secretary Lansing refused to talk. Mr.
Lansing said, "I cannot say a word.
Action awaits further word from General Pershing. If Carranza ac
cepts responsibility for the Carrizal affair, officials believe President Wil
'son will order the occupation of most of Northern Mexico. . " -
TWENTY-SIX AMERICANS KILLED

ribal are believed to have been killed. According to this the total of the

PARKER WILL

" (Palatka Times-Herald)
Well founded report has it that
Billy Parker, one of the Nelson Miles
lieutenants who was sent, down from
Pennsylvania to damn the Catholics
at so much per, and to spread the
germs of discord in the ranks of the
democrats, and to "bust" the party in
Florida, if possible, is to become not
only a citizen of Putnam county, but
is to reside in one of the "show
places' of this section. For 'tis stat
ed that Billy has purchased from the
Rix family their handsome home at a
consideration running into the thou
sands. Billy having solidly lined up the
"rampanters" behind friend : Catts,
thinks he can rest from his laurels,
and then as he is doubtless tired of
taking in the "easy money" from his
hard-working, gullible fellows, he de
serves a vacation. - Billy now has the
coin, and he puts some of his loose
chance fa an ideal home, proposes to
become a citizen of Florida, and gets
ready to assume his place as the pow
er behind the throne of "Governor
Sidney J. Catts."

TO SOU D GOOD
THEIR
The first defienite step toward .se
curing a bond election for the pur
pose of giving Marion county perma
nent roads was taken today, when a
committee consisting of L. W. Duval
and Jake Brown appeared before the
democratic executive committee, in
session in the office of Judge Fer
guson in the court house, and asked
that each committeeman call a meet
ing in his precinct, or take such steps
as he might deem best, -with a view
Jto sending three or more delegates to
a convention in Ocala July 12. At this
convention it is proposed "to, discuss
full ythe question of a bond issue,
and, if it appears that the sentiment
is favorable, the county commission
ers will be asked to meet in special
session and call an election."
As was brought out at the informal
meeting here Monday night, the idea
is to arrange things so that the voter
will know just how the bond money is
to be spent, where it is to be spent,
and by whom it is to be spent. It is
proposed to follow the example of
Polk county and have all , the specifi
cations prepared by a jompetent en
gineer, ids called 'for, t and the con
tracts let subject- to the vote of the
people. i Vi
The members of the executive com
mittee agreed to take the'matter up
m their respective precincts.
Mr. J. J. Gerig, who has returned
from a trip to the East Coast, said
this mornine- that he found the rnad
from the Liike 5ounty.Iine north to
Ocala in very bad condition This
road from the Lake line to Belleview
has just been rebuilt. ; Now it needs
to be repaired again, and provides an
obvious reason why this county should
have roads of a permanent and more
economical form.1

CONTESTING THE
ELECTION OF CATTS
W. V. Knott Asks for Recount of the
Votes in at Least Eight '
Counties
J acksonville, June 24. Attorneys
for State-Comptroller W. V. Knott
have petitioned the circuit courts of
Duval. Calhoun. Leon nrul TTnl
counties for a recount of the second
choice ballots cast in. the different
precincts for governor . in the demo
cratic state-wide primary of June G.
Similar petitions will be filed in four
other counties, the names of which
were not divulged.
A -recount of practically the entire
vote of Holmes county is demanded.
Nine of the pricincts in Duval are
questioned.
Mr. Knott believes a recount will
show that the second choice votes in
many cases were not correctly cred
ited through unfamiliarity of the in
spectors and clerks of the local elec
tion boards with that method of vot
ing and tallying. He is of the opin
ion that the lead of "less than 200
votes which S. J. Catts apparently
has for governor will be overcome in
a recount of just a few counties.''
WORKING ON "THE
GOOD ROADS IDEA
Savannah Engineer Here in Confer
ence with Commissioner
Cam
H. S. Jaudon, president " of the
Jaudon Engineering company of Sa
vannah, whose company prepared the
specifications for' the Polk county
roads provided for in the ?1,500,000
bond issue just voted in that county,
is here today conferring with Chair
man W. D. Cam,, of the county com
missioners, and a number of citizens.
He said he had read in the Tampa
papers of the bond issue proposed for
this county on a plan similar to that
of. Polk county, and thought that he.
would look into the matter.
Mr. Jaudon says that the Polk
county roads are to be constructed of
sheet asphalt with a mineral filler,
and not of sand-asphalt. He consid-,
ers the sheet asphalt the best, as has
been proved by its use in Washington,
New York and other large cities. He
pointed out that sheet asphalt had
been down in Savannah for 20 years.
The cost, according to the engineer, is
little more than the sand-asphalt.
If he can do so, Mr. Joudon will ar
range to attend the meeting here on
July 12, when the proposed bond issue
for the county will be discussed. -
