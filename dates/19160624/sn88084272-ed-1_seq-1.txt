Paris, France, June 24. The battle
of Verdun continued Friday night with
the utmost violence on both sides of
J the Meuae. The war office announced
today that the French have regained
a large part of the ground lost north

French drove back the Germans over
the ground which they won Friday. The
battle was particularly violent in the
vicinity of Fluery. The French did not
succeed in regaining possession of the
Thiaumont work.
More than six German divisions par

Late details show .that the fighting
near Verdun equaled in fury anything
yet experienced. The total German
forces engaged on a two mile form are
estimated at between four and five
divisions. It was only by the last
overwhelming rush, when the defend
ers were worn out and thinned by
many hours' bombardment, that the
enemy succeeded in rushing the Thlau
monts works and the adjacent advanced
trenches.

BURNS
first Intimation anyone had that hos
tilities -were determined upon, was the
outburst of machine gun fire. They cor
roborated the accounts that said It was
not until then that Capt Boyd gave the
command for his men to dismount and
return the fire. The Mexicans during
the parley had crowded forward and
had assumed such positions that when
they attacked they were in position to
sweep with killing fire the American
line standing exposed in the open.
Believe Battered Remnant Woonded.
Officers at Gen. Funs ton's headquar

Gen. Pershing's latest report that all I
or tne troops that would be found now
would be wounded and that, therefore,
the' battered remnant could not have
moved far from the scene of the flint.

100,000 NEGRO
TI0PSI0RU.S.
Government Man Suggests
Recruiting Troops in
South for Mexico
A suggestion has been sent to the
war jdepartment from a government of
ficial In El Paso that 100.0O4 negro
troops be recruited In the southern
states for use in the event that the
United States invades Mesico.
The suggestion has been telegraphed
to the secretary of war from here and
is based on the theory that the negro
troops will be hotter able to cope with
conditions In the desert country of
Mexico than will the American troops.
The splendid service rendered the col
ors by the negro troops now servlag
with Gen. Pershing's command is cited
as an example of what Ue negro
troops could do in the event or war
wltn Mexico.
Tae message states that there would
De no difficulty in securing the 100.M6
men f,. the negro commands for the
period of the campaign and that these
raen coum be drilled on the border and
in tbe camps and sent into the hot dis-
trtcts as fast as tney are seasoned.
