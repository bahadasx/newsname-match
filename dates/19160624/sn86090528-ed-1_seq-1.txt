The vheat crop will full below that

. Tjie report of 1015 showed a total of
iih.OnO acres of wheat in Grady coun

crease of fully 15 per cent. There was
marcolv as many acres seeded last
fall us was seeded during the fall of
V.iU, and the hard winter injured a
part of the acreage to such an extent
that in portions of the county it was
plowed up and the ground planted to
corn this spring. Up to within a cou
ple of weeks of harvest the wheat con
ditions did not seem to be nearly as
good as was really proved to be the
case. Rains coming just before wheat
ripened caused a material increase in
the expected yield and helped to make
the grain of a better quality. Last
year the average yield per acre for
Grady county was la bushels; this
ear's yield per acre will show a 'de
crease, it is believed. In the central

Is estimated that the yl'jld will run
well over the 13 bushel mark, but on

that mark.
Inforpiutioii given out at the offices
of gr'air dealers says the grain this
year is of a high grade and full weight.
It is also stated that up to the pres

have been done the wheat crop by the
rains, but with the crop now in the
shock, continued rains will injure the
graiu materially. Owing to the great
shortage in the wheat crop in Texas,
tho domestic demand is causing a
price of fully five cents per bushel
more than the prices set on export
