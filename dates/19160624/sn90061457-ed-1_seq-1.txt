MARSHAL
It Will Not Be Because the People of the
East Are Not Heartily for
Both of Them
And So Are the Great Papers as Witness
the Attitude of New York's
Greatest Newspaper
Some of the people of the Middle i
West and especially those in Mis-!
courl, seem to he embued with the)
idea that the East has no friends of
President Wilson. This idea can be
casil disabused If the people will
ead the great papers published in the
East for they rellect the sentiment
of the people of that section and
when once the doubters have read
these publications and thereby see
how they stand, they will readily per
ceive that there Is no possibility of
defeating President Wilson, who
stands for the people all of them
and not for special Interests or special
privilege. Just as an instance, take
this from the New York World, one
of the greatest papers of the East,
which "under the head of "Why Wilson
Should Win," sas editorially:
The Best Definition
"The best definition of Democracy
that we know was framed by EUhu
Hoot: S
"Popular government Is organized
self-control organized capacity for
the development of the race."
"In our opinion the greatest living
leader cf such a Democracy Is Wood
row Wilson.
"During the last two years Mr. Wil-
son has guided the icpuhlic through
the most critical period of its history
since the civil war. The problems
his immediate predecessors had to
solve were child's play in comparison
with those that confronted him. He
has rested under a burden of respon
sibility heavier than that of any other
president except Washington and Lin
coln. Through it all he has kept
the peace and honor cf the nation and
the true faith of Democracy.
"It Is easy enough to find fault with
the president. Mr. Hughes had hardly
thrown off the robes of his Judicial
office before he made a smashing at
tack upon Mr. Wilson, but, like assail
ants of the president. Mr. Hughes did
not venture to say what he would
have done that Mr. Wilson failed to
do or what he would have left undone
that Mr. Wilson did.
Answer Through Republicans
"For an answer to all such critcism
we shall go to another eminent repub
lican, Samuel W. McCall, now gover
nor of Massachusetts, who, in a lec
ture at Yale last ear, on 'The Lib
erty of Citizenship," said:
To rebuild history in Imagination
and to aoid in our mind the errors
hat have been made is not at all a
difficult art. It Is no more difficult
than to get rich out of yesterday's
stock market. Hut the statesman who
stands In tho front of the advancing
line and facing the, future has no con
trol over the past. His domain is the
present and he strives to influence
what Is to come. He must act before
he knows how things are going to
turn out.'
"Governor McCall has admirably
.scribed the difference between
President Wilson and Mr. Hughes in
this campaign. The president Is the
man who has been In the front of
the advancing line, and who had to
act before he knew how things were
going to turn out. Mr, Hughes has
been sheltered In tho cool and quiet
cloisters of the United States supreme
court, and now rushes out to censure
the man who has borne the heat and
Irunt of the battle."
But Wilson Could Not Walt
"When Judges liko Mr. Hughes are
perplexed by an intricate and complt-
tated case, they order the lawyers to
reargue it. The cases that have come
before the president could not be re
argued. He was compelled to decide
without delay or hesitation questions
that involved the destiny of the nation
for half a century. Tlure was nobody
with whom be could share the respon
sibility, The peaco and welfare of
100,000,000 hinged upon his word, and
LSI
L WIN THE BAnLE?
he hnb brought them safely through
en h difficulty."
on 0f tjit, complaints cf the presi-
dents's critics Is that while his atti
tude toward Germany was sound, he
deserves, unsparing censure for the
long delays that ensued before the im
nerial aov eminent conceded his de
mands. This is like attacking Mr.
Hughes for having been nominated oi
the third bnllot instead of the first
ballot. Grave Issues must be settled
when they can be settled, and between
negotiation and war there is no middle
course."
"He is a very conceited man who
dares to stand before the American
people and tell Uiem ir detail wherein
he would have been a better .presi
dent than Woodrow WJNon. None of
the president's critics Including Mr.
Hughes, has jet undertaken that task.
Nor do we think that .Mr. Hughes
,!th all the advantages that come
f oni rebuilding history In Imagination
t'nd getting lich out of yesterday's
-fork maiket, will venture to submit a
bill of particular to prove that in the
midst of the world disaster of modern
civilization he would have been a
wiser and an abler leader of Demo
cracy than Uie president has been."
Owe It to Wilson
"The American people owe their
peace and prosperity to Woodrow Wil
son and they owe to him the most lm
portant program of progressive do
mestic legislation ever enacted by a
single administration since Washing,
ton's. .He has taken plutocracy and
privilege out of popular .government
and put the republic back -on the Dem.
ocratic track. .They are further In
debted to him -for the most compre
hensive measures of national defense
ever undertaken in time cf peace
measures that bid -fair to solve the
-M-rnlffxlna oroblem of -arming a De
mocracy and still holding it fast to tne
Best traditions of Democracy." ..
"His leadership luis made the coun
rv readv to face tht new ptoblems
hat a world war hub imposed upon
mankind. He has pointed the way to
.i new peace of the nations by vvhkh
the weak can be protected against the
strong and the security of each gu:u
anteed by the stren"t:i of all. Ameri
can Democracy cannot repudiate him
without repudiating Us highest ideal-,
and aspirations."
"Wo should not dream of pacing the
president the silly compliment ot suv
.tig that he had made no mistakes.
Like all other human beings, he has
committed faults of reasoning .and
faults of judgement, but bis adminis
tration as a w hole has mov ed ever for
ward, ever in the right direction, ever
la the pathway of true Americanlsim
and true Democracy. Its impulses
have been the right impulses, its mo
tives the right motives, Its principles
the right principles."
Would Not Dream of It
.."No other, country in the world
would dream at a time like this of
driving a tried leader like Woodrow
Wilson out of office to make an ex
perlment. .No other country In the
world would hold Its peace and Its wel.
fare In such light esteem that It would
care to take chances and substitute
the unknown for the known."
.."Mr. Wilson has given to the Amerl
can people the one truly progressive
administration that they have had
since, liberty, and. union, overcame
slavery and secession, only to sink In
to the quicksands of plutocracy and
reaction."
"Whatever the outcome of me elec
tion may he. his place in history is
fixed. He will rank not only among
the great presidents of the United
States but among the great leader?
of Democracy for all time."

AN IMPORTANT RULING
Judge DivllbisB Rules That Common
Carriers May Transport Liquor
Into Local Option Territory
Judge Prank P Divllblss of the Clay
county circuit, has Just rendered a
decision which is of wide and sweep
ing Importance, as it will put a stop
to the wholtEtile injunctions now be
ing granted In counties which have
voted local option and which are now
through the process of Injunctions
secured against railroad and express
companies stopping the shipment of
liquor Into these counties. For the
past few months there has been a
tumbling over each other of dry coun
ty prosecuting attorneys in their se
curing of injunctions. Now Judge
Divllblss, who by the way Is also a
dry judge, has spilled all their fish by
his decision, which has been given
after great dciliberation, the opinion
Itself with Its numerous citations con
taining over 15,000 words and flatly
denying the writ of injunction asked
by Ernest O. Slmrall, prosecuting at
torney of Clay county, who would stop
the shipments of liquor into dry Clay
county.
In e'osing his decision Judge Divll
bes says: "Under the local option
law itself a person has the right in
this state to order liquor for his own
or family use, and no valid reason can
be Riven why a common carrier may
not be compelled to accept Intra-state
shipments which are intended for
such, or for any other lawful purpose."
In referring to the alleged shipment
of liquors into the state to parties
who ue It for unlawful purposes.
Judge Divllblss hits the nail on the
head when he specifically says.
"It is alleged that the defendants,
their agonts and emplojes are know
ingly and willfully delivering intoxi
cating liquors in the local option dis
tricts of this county to known boot
leggers and keepers of blind tigers
and other disreputable places, well
know ins the unlaw ful purposes to
which such liquors are to be put. If
such be the fart, then 1 WOULD SAY
TO THE STATE: 'STRETCH FORTH
THINE HAND, LAY HOLD OF
THESE ALLEGED BOOTLEGGERS
ON WHEELS. ARRAIGN THEM AT
THE CAR OF JUSTICE; TRY, CON
VICT AND PUNISH THEM AS ANY
OTHER VIOLATOR OF THE LAW,

JUST SUPERSTITION
And as Baseless and as Silly as
Many Other Things That Are
Without Foundation
Whcrte came the baseless sup-
erstiticn that the Republican
party is the party of business
ability and management?
We do not care, at the moment,
to prt'fnt our views of this won-
derful delusion; we desire only
to ask certain questions, and in-
vite our readers, without regard
to political faith, to answer them
for themselves.
When, the Democrats took over
the national government after
Republican domination extending
thr'"gh well-nigh half a century,
whai was the condition of
Our cue., ns tariff policy.
Our ba .king and currency sys-
tern.
Our (. i iservation rollcy.
Our Iphs for the regulation
and cor ol of great corporations
Our m chinery for encouraging

Our machinery for rural cred-
it.

it hind our army.
The provision for an auxiliary
fleft for our navj.

our
merchant marine.
There are the greatest busi-
,ne-s responsibilities that rest
tilin modern governments What
one of them had been fairly and
adequately met by the Republi-
cans? Where is the evidence

itin the field of government on
the part of the Republican party9
What history tariff, currency,
conservation, what you please
is thtre that is not a history of
incapacity, blindness and "mud
dling along?"
And now, go over the list
again What has the Democracy,
In three short years, done with
the weighty matters there cata
logued? What sort of capacity
has it displayed in dealing with
them? What are its deserts at
,tle hands of the nation, in conse-
qtience? In the answer to this
atestion is to be found the secret
of the temper of the representa-
tives of national Democracy. St.
Louis Republic.
THE LYING K. C. STAR
That Apostle of "Righteousness," and
How It Handled Its Tax

To read the Kansas City Star at

!less than one month ago, Mr. Gus
Seested, the general manager of the
Kansas City Star, testified under oath
that the Star was worth five million
I
dollars, and that he would give that
amount for it; and that its earning
capacity was $250,000 per year net.
And I find from investigation of the
tax books in Kansas City that for the
year 1908 the Kansas City Star was
assessed on a valuation of 118,800, or
less than two and tbree-nfths per cent
lot Its actual cash value; so while the

L
The Unprecedented Increase of
$2,198,000,000 Made in a
Single Year
IS A
TRIUMPH
OF DEMOCRACY
This Greatly Increased Reserve Gives
the Financial Institutions a Loaning
Power of Six Billion Dollars and as
a Result the Farmer and Wage
Earner Are Sharing Alike in the
Great Prosperity Which America Is
Now Enjoying.
Secretary McAdoo, In a speech of
unusual power and significance, deliv
ered at Raleiah, N. C, May 31, pre
sented incontrovertible evidence of
the country's prosperity and stability,
as the result of measures adopted by
the Democratic administration. When
the country was on the verge of ap
palling panic, at the outbreak of the '
European war in 1011, it wag, he said,
the decisive and adequate measures
taken by the government at Washing
ton that prevented this panic and laid
a secure foundation for the great pros
perity we now enjoy.
"What a sontrast this is," said the
secretary, "to the ineffectiveness of
the Republican administration at
Washington during the panic of 1907,
which left the country prostrate for
many years and brought immeasur
able disaster upon the American
ppople "
Reserve Act Leading Factor
A leading factor in all this has been
the federal reserve act, "which is now
generally conceded to be the most
constructive measure placed upon our
statute books in a half century." Con
tinuing, the secretary said:
"Nothing Is more Indicative of '
the amazing growth of the coun. I
try than the condition of the '
banks. The comptroller of the
currency states that In March,
1916, the resources of the na.
tional banks amounted to $13,
838,000,000, exceeding by $370,-
000,000 the greatest resources I
ever shown In the history of the
national banking system. The
resources of the national banks
were $2,271,000,000 greater in
March, 1916, than in March, 1915.
"This marvelous Increase in
one year exceeds, the comptroller
states, the entire resources of the
Reichsbank cf Germany, as re
ported in February, 1916.
"The aggregate resources of the
national banks of the United
States new exceed by approxi
mately $3,000,000,000 the com
bined resources of the Bank of
England, the Bank of France, the
Bank of Russia, the Reichsbank
of Germany, the Bank cf the Neth
erlands, the Swiss National Bank
and the Bank of Japan. The total
deposits of the national banks in
March, 1916, amounted to $10,790,.
000,000, an increase in three
months of $411,000,000, and an in.
crease over March, 1915 (one
year), of $2,1 58,000,000.
"These figures are so prodigious as
to be almost unbelievable. They re
llect Infallibly the degree of prosperity
as wide and deep as It is amazing and
gratifying. One can not speak of this
record without superlatives Even the
infallible and sanctified Republican
party could not-have done better."
All Share In Prosperity
The secretary pointed out that pros
perity is permeating every corner of
the country and every class of the
American people. Labor Is employed
throughout the land at the highest
wages ever known. The dinner pail is
overflowing. The farmers of the
United States never in their history
have enjoyed such splendid rewards
for their toll.
"The Rural Credits Bill," he said,
"which will soon be passed and ap
proved by the president, will emanci
pate the farmer from many of the
most serious ills he has so long en
dured and provide the long time cred
its, at low rates of interest, so essen
tian to the remunerative and pro
ductive development of the farming
Industry.
"The prosperity of the country
Is strikingly reflected In the sur
plus reserves of the national
banks. These reserves are now
to great that they give the nation,
al banks a further loaning power

of three to four billion dollars.
If we add to this the loaning
power of the state banks and trust
companies of the country, we
;have an aggregate approximating
the astounding total of six billion
dollars.
To Forestall "Dumping"
"An analysis of the conditions in
the United States and of the posslbli,
economic ijffects of the war in Europe
does not, in my opinion, give the
"lightest Justification for any fear foe
our prosperity. A Democratic con
gress, however, out of deference to
any honest apprbhenslon that may ex
ist in the minds of business men, wilt
enart legislation against the dumping,
of cheap European goods In our mar
kets and will prohibit by law unfair
competition by foreign competitors
with American business men and
manufacturers. While I do not believe
these measures are essential, I favor
than simply as a precaution and as an
assurance to the timid and hesitating.
"When I contrast the enormous
financial and economic strength ot the
United States and the extraordinary
skill and creative genius of its peo
ple, with the depleted resources and
the weakened economic power of the
great European nations, and the de
struction of so much of their skilled
labor and manhood, I feel somewhat
ashamed of the frixht and timidity
manifested by some people of the
United States whom we bavo been ac
customed to regard as really strong.
Europe Will Be Crippled
When peace is restored to Europe,
the belligerent nations will find them
selves burdened with an almost insup
portable load of debt. Taxation, both
oppressive and excessive, must be
borne to pay the interest on these
debts. Taxation is an important
factor in the cost of production and
adds materially and will seriously af-
feet the competitive capacity of Ger-
industrial nations of Europe. Many of
their skilled workmen have been lost,
and new ones must be created; many
of their Industries have been de
stroyed and must be reconstructed.
Their credit resources are seriously
Impaired Other serious difficulties
must be overcome if they are to re
gain their foreign markets. Against
these formidable handicaps and ter
rible conditions, is it unbelievable that
the American people, with their high
ly developed industries and skilled
labor, matchless resources, exception
al creative genius and productive ca
pacity, are unable to sustain them
selves in a fair contest for their share
of the world's markets? Can it truth
fully be said that our economic safety
and prosperity will have to face any
real peril? It is almost discreditable
to our intelligence to have to argue
such a proposition "
KIND WORDS FOR
JUDGE BURNES
He
Is Classed as One of Those on the
Eeneh Who Do
Things ,
The fifth Judicial district of Mis
souri is very fortunate in having as
its circuit judge such a man as Judge
A. D. Burnes, and it ls a fine compli
ment to his honesty, ability and gen
eral worth that he Is to be again
chosen for that -high and honorable
position without opposition. Earlier
in the year, the bar of the district,
without regard to party lines or af
filiation, joined unanimously in re
questing b m to succeed himself. His
acceptance of that call, settled the
matter so far as the people of the
district were concerned. They knew
we vvuuld have another term ot years
in which all court business that found
its way into Judge Burnes' court
would be handled promptly, fairly and
at the minimum of expense, so fax
as court costs were concerned. H?
keeps the business of his courts well
in hand, and the public is never put
to unnecessary expense. That is a
big item to the various counties of the
district, and to the people who must
go to court, and it is only one of the
many ways through which he has en
deared himself to the people whom
he' has served so long and faithfully.
