EbifMIAL COMMENT
, Jr Mr
The, local soldier1 boys arc not
' pleased with the change of program
by which thoy will be started in the
direction of Canai
Tb go to Mexico.
r Secretary Bake
4he departmental
Canada when they want
Baker yesterday ordered
Jhe departmental commanders to send
to the border all militia available lnv
mediately upon organization, without
"waiting for the rnobiUzaliqn oFsppn-
rate states.
The papers ofMexico City claimed
the clash at Carrizal , was "a battle'
won by the Mexicans. Gen. Felix
Gomez, who led the Mexicans, was
killed. Ho who was one of the
youngest and most popular leaders of
the de facto army.
The Maine law made Madeline
Force Astor adopt a policy of watch
ful waiting for five days before she
could wed, after the leap year license
was secured, and the longer she
.waited the madder she got. But she
got in a good humor Thursday.
President Wilson has denied the
request of Lieut. Robt. Fay that he
be deported to Germany rather tha,n
be taken to the federal' penitentiary
at Atlanta to serve his eight years
sentence for conspiring to destroy
steamships carrying munitions of war
to the entente allies.
The Falmouth Outlook replying
to
a paragraph in this paper says:
s"Any one of the visiting farmers
"'There on June 8th who did not get all
the information he wanted was a deaf
mute and could not ask questions.
Everybody in Falmouth and Pendle
ton county styled himself as a com
mittee of one to inform the visitors on
v any subject, and plenty of it was free
I ly done. We saw no evidence what-
ever of politicians monopolizing the
time of the farmers while in Pendle
ton county. We kept them on the
jump all the while they "were here
and covered seVenty miles of territory
in the county."
Pendleton county did her part well
and all brought back glowing ac
counts of what they saw. It was
- what they were compelled to set
aside their own speakers and listen
to that failed to please, not only at
Falmouth but elsewhere.

WILL REPEAT ATTACK.
In announcing a story of tho battle
which ho said SpiUsbury told him,
Gen. Jacinto Trevinto, commander of
tho military district of the northeast,
announceu mat any time anu at any
place the American troops move other
than toward the border, he will
comply to the letter with his superior's
orders and will attack them as Gen
Felix Gomez did at Carrizal. i
Gen. Trevino said that all diploma
tic arrangements aro outside of his
sphere.
Spillsbiiry's story, announced by
Gen. Trevino, was to the effect that
76 negroes, comprising troop H of
the Tenth, Captains Boyd and Moore,
Lieut. Adair and himself, composed
the American detachment that en
countered the Mexicans. He said that
he saw on the field the bodies of
Boyd and Adair and at least ten of
the negroes.
Spillsbury's account as given out,
follows:
"We left Casas Grandcs on Sunday
morning, arriving outside of Carrizal
early Wednesday morning.
"Capt. Boyd immediately dispatch
ed a courier to the jefe politico of tho
little village, advising him we were
on our way to Villa Ahumada."
WARNED TO TURN BACK. .
"After we had waited some time,
Lieut. Col. Rivas came out and warn
ed Capt. Boyd that lie would better
turn back. Capt. Boyd then explained
that ho was in pursuit of some bandits
which he had heard had looted Santo
Domingo, and also was bound to
catch a negro deserter who he had
heard was in Villa Ahumada.
"In reply to this Lieut. Rivas noti
fied the American that if he attempted
to advance ho would have to pass
over the dead bodies of the Mexicans.
He advised Boyd that he had better
not argue the matter.
"Rivas returned to the village to
report to his superior officer. Gen.
I Gomez, who sent out a note inviting
the Americans to enter Carrizal for a
conference. Capt. Boyd declined this
invitation.
"On, this ground Gomez went out
in person and insistently urged the
Americans to retire, pointing out that
his orders from his superiors neces
sitated his acting on them without
further parley. Gen. Gomez repeat
ed these words as he walked away.
Boyd merely answered, "all right.' "
FIRING BEGINS.
Gen. Trevino's announcement then
goes on to quote SpiUsbury as saying
that after Gomez had retired to his
troops who were outlined outside tho
town, Capt. Boyd ordered his men to ;
advance, whereupon SpiUsbury ex
postulated with him, arguing that a
fight was sure to follow. SpiUsbury
is reported as saying that Capt, Boyd
"obstinately seemed to think that tho
Mexican general was only bluffing"
and the firing quickly began.
Ho is quoted further: "Capt. Moore
and Lieut. Adair fell wounded the
latter mortally. Capt. Moor,e was
wounded in tho shoulder and immed
iately tho negroes became demoral
ized. At tho same, time (hp men
holding tho horses fled with the
mounts, leaving behind 17 negroes
and myself. Wo were forced to sur
render."

lected last night by tho War Depart
ment, as the place where the Ken
tucky National Guard will mobilize.
Following this official announcement,
made shortly before five o'clock this
evening, by Secretary of War Baker?
orders were issued directing the offi
cers and enlisted men o the" Ken
tucky militia to proceed to the concen
tration camp at the earliest possible
moment. The final selection of Fort
Thomas as the mobilization point for
the State militia, instead of Earling
ton that previously had been decided
on by the War Department, or any
other city, is in line with the original
recommendation of the Kentucky mil
itary authorities and in accord with
the plan worked out months ago by
the War College here. Up to noon
Thursday the War Department had
practically made up its mind that Ear
Iington was to be the place for the
gathering of the Kentucky troops.
Then Secretary Baker decided t6 re
consider the matter.

pitch.

Army Bill Provisions.
Following a rough passage between
the House and the Senate, the regular
army qui unauy emerged sate, tnougn
a bit seasick, landing in tho executive,
harbor with the Continental Army
plan only a memory. Tho bill pro-
vides for 606,000 men peace strength
and 73,000 additional for an emer
gency. An interesting provision of the bill is,
for vocational training of tho men in
tho regular army under tho direction .
of tho Secretary of War, and the pro-
posal to maintain government nitrate
plants, tho product of which will be i
used for fertilizer when not needed '
in war times. j
I Tho President is authorized to in-
evstigate the mobilization of tho indus-
tries of tho country In time of war, to
add effective unity of private interests
with thoso of tho nation, should tho
emergency arise. j
Enlistment in tho regular army is
now fixed at seven vears three with

only a phase of preparedness which
has been "ptimdod" into popular
favor.
It was a long and porplexing con
ferenc2, but both Senator Chamber
lain in the Senate, and Chairman Hay
in the H"ine, feel that they hnve at
last provided an army bill that will
meet the necessities of the times, as
viewed from the standpoint of a
peace-loving nation. "Affairs at

German Open Ud General
Offensive from Pripet to
Riga Results Are Few.
London, June 23. The Germans
and Austrians in Volhynia arc vigor
ously on the offensive against the
Russians and seemingly have stopped
for the time being, at least, the Rus
sian drive westward.
From north of the Pripet marshes
tp the region of Riga, the Germans
again have opened what apparently is
a general offensive, heavily bombard
ing Russian positions and throwing
violent infantry attacks against them.
HEAVY BOMBARDMENT AT VER
DUN. On both sides of the river Meuse in
the region of Verdun and to the east
of the fortress in the Wocvre at the
foot of the Meuse hills, the Germans
are heavily bombarding the French.
The Germans near Givenchy cap
tured British trenches, but later were
driven out, suffering heavy losses in
the counter attack.
ALLIED AIRMEN BUSY.'
Considerable aerial activity against
German towns has taken place,
French machines having dropped
bombs in Trevis, Karlsruhe and Mul
heim. In air battles four German
aeroplanes were brought down by the
French who in turn lost one machine
through motor trouble.
No important changes in the situa
tion on the Austro-Italian theater or in
Asiatic Turkey have been reported.
GREECE GRANTS DEMANDS.
The ultimatum of the entente pow
ers to Greece has been yielded to by
tho Hellenic kingdom. The demands
include complete demobilization of tho
Greek army, the formation of a cabi
net benevolently neutral to the entente
allies, the holding of new elections
and the reconstruction of the gendar
merie. The Greek cabinet has al
ready resigned and another is in pro
cess of formation.
