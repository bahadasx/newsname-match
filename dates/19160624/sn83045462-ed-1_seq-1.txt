Will Demand Repudiation.
It is believed the first act of the
Washington government when fuller
Information is at hand will be to demand
repudiation of the Carrizal atk
tack by the Carranza government. Preliminary
reports have convinced officials
here that the American troops
who went to Carrizal were deliberately
led into a trap. The main question remaining
to be cettled, it is indicated,
im whether the Carranza government
ordered the attack or it was the work
of a subordinate officer.
In the latter event, unqualified repudiation
of his act will be demanded, it
la indicated. Gen. Gomez. Carranza
commander at Carrizal. was killed in
action, according to Mexican reporfs.
The stipulation that the officer responsible
be adequately punished unquestionably
would accompany a demand
for repudiation, but if the Carranza
commander gave orders to open fire he
has already paid the penalty for his
act.
To Inquire About Captive Troopers.
The State Department will at once
make inquiry about the troopers held
as prisoners, and will pertinently ask
Carranza why these men are held as
they have committed to cause them tc
be held by that government, it it
learned in high sources today. In effect
the inquiry will be a demand that
the men will be released at once unless
It can be shown in unmistakable terms
that they were guilty of deliberate^
provoking a battle with the armed
forces of Mexico. No sort of quibbling
excuse will be accepted.
The Mexican government must now
be in possession of all facts from itf
viewpoint, according to the State Department.
If it has not already released
the troopers it must have par
ticularly good reasons for holding them
longer. This government wants tc
know what those reasons are and expects
prompt answer from Carranza or
the subject.
The question of release of thf
prisoners, which Secretary Lansing
arranged to make immediately upon hia

That the President himself realizes
that the apparently inevitable break is
almost here is shown by this conference,
which lasted an hour, and whicl
brought out the information that litth

more the President has invariably taker
Saturdays as rest days, seeing no visit

of the German correspondence.

return to the State Department from
the White House, will bring: out, it
was believed at noon today, the entire
story from Mexico's viewpoint. Against
this version of Mexico will be set the
version of Americans who were in the
fight and know exactly what happened,
and. with the two versions before him,
President Wilson will decide the issue
?war with Mexico or the continuance
I of the uncertain and dangerous conditions
that have existed so long.
So far as the United States is concerned,
there were indications today
that miiiutary operations, even if already
decided' upon, would be delayed
some days. It will require nearly a week,
it is understood, to complete the mobilization
of enough of the National Guard
on the border to make possible a movement
in force beyond the line. The
b*order patrol must be maintained and
I strengthened, even if occupation of all
j northern Mexico is in progress. Amerj
ican lives and property would be in
. danger, otherwise, and the first purl
pose of ami action taken will be to
; safeguard the towns and ranches along
j the international line.
.Regulars would flake Advance.
It is regarded as probable that regular
army regiments now on patrol
| duty would be promptly relieved by
National Guard regiments as they
reach the border. The regulars, already
acclimated and prepared by
months of border work for a vigorous
campaign, would be concentrated at
the points from which a general advance
would be begun.
Secretary Baker had no additional advices
from Gen. Funston when he went
to the White House. Secretary Lansing
had received a dispatch from Mexico
City announcing that the thirty
Americans in Guanajuato, held there by
i lack of transportation, had been promised
train facilities by the Carranza auI
thorities.
I The work of getting Americans out
j of Mexico has proceeded rapidly. With!
in 9 wppk n ronrrl i nir to nrARpnt inHirn
i tions, there will be very few remaining:
there. Navy ships are hastening to
i every important port to pick them up.
A cordon of ships for this purpose has
; been established on both coasts. They
would also be ready for blockade duty
i I or any other service if war comes.
sfD CARRANZA
POSITION KNOWN
t of American cavalry were virtually
g wiped out. He explained, in answer
. to questions, that apparently the only
1 men who have returned to the base of
Gen. Pershing were those far back
from the scene of the actual fighting
and not fully acquainted with precisely
what happened. The secretary pinned
much faith on soon getting news from
the two squadrons of cavalry sent to
the relief of the few men left of the
colored troopers.
Pressed closely about the imprisonment
in Ghihuahua of twenty-four men
who were in the Carrizal fight, Secretary
Baker said that the only official information
that has come to the government
on this subject was from
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican delegate
here. The War Department, he said,
had not received a word through any
of its officers concerning the taking of
these men as prisoners. No Mexican
army officers had informed American
army officers that prisoners are in their
possession. Indirectly the intimation
from the Secretary of War was that the
' State Department would handle this
part of the question for the minute.
[ Secretary Lansing Silent.
Secretary Lansing, on leaving: the
1 White .House, told the inquiring: news
paper men that he could not say a
s word. He consistently held to that
f purpose despite many questions asked
I him. He went directly to the State De9
partrnent, where he called in his stenographer
and began dictation of an
Important message, believed to be intended
immediately and directly for
Carranza.
The obvious outcome of the morning
conference. despttW the lack of official
admission, is believed to have been
the determination of the President to
hold tight pending the receipt of fuller
and more enlightening Information.
Every effort, however. Is to be made
to obtain that information as quickly
as possible, because the administration
recognizes that popular opinion
throughout this country is becoming
thoroughly aroused and drill not be
satisfied with unusual delay.

24.?Complete disorganization of

troops, and the practical annihilation

today.
One packer and eight enlisted
men of Troop C and seven men
of Troop K were picked up yesterday
morning by Lieut. Meyer

told were almost identical to ~
those told by the other stragglers
that reached the American lines
yesterday.
-SAN ANTONIO. Tex. Tune
24.?In the shadow of the Alamo,
where the deeds of Davy Crockett,
James Bowie, Col. Travis and
Col. Bonham made history seventy
years ago, citizens of San Antonio
today were convinced that
another Alamo had been fought
last Wednesday at Carrizal by
Capt. Charles T. Boyd's troopers
of the ioth Cavalry, and that the
names of Capts. Boyd and Morey
and Lieut. Adair would go down
into history alongside those of
their illustrious predecessors.
Officers at southern division headquarters,
however, still hoped that a ?
complete and official report from Gen. ~"
Pershing: would show that more than 1
the seven men who have reached the 1
main column have escaped death, |
wounds or capture.
Gen. Funston received no later report
regranlingr the Carrizal engrossment
from Gen. Pershing: early today,
and this was taken to mean that the
commander of the relief squadron had
been unable to gret a message back to
the American lines. Gen. Fynston's
earlier reports to Washington con- |i
tained nothing better than the hope
that the remnant of Capt. Boyd's little
command had escaped annihilation.
Their Plight Was Desperate.
None, however, disputes the fact that
the fragmentary reports show that the
plight of the little band of Americans
must have been desperate. Trapped,
according to these reports, by the pre- o
tense of a parley, nearly eighty miles ^
from the nearest chance for aid, surrounded
by a tremendously superior S:
force while endeavoring to avoid a ft
clash, swept hv machine gun and rifle _
Are, their horses stampeded and a wild
Mexican cavalry charge sweeping down o
on the flank, it was realized here that ^
only a desperate stand, reinforced by
extraordinary fortune, could have saved
all but a few from death or capture.
The available reports, showing that S
Capt. Boyd hoped to avoid a clash, gave r
no indication that the American troop- C.
ers occupied ground when the battle .1
opened which could be readily defended
or that would afford protection frbm

but the French advanced line still
holds good, possessing the greater part
of H1113 320 and 321. These fresh
strokes of the German battering ram
are regarded in authoritative quarters,
it is understood, with perfect calm.
They will in no way, it is pointed out
here, prevent expected developments;
on the contrary, they are likely to
hasten them.
Object of the Germans.
The object of the German commander
is to secure control of the Vaux ravine,
without which it is impossible for him to
force back the French advanced line and
begin an attack upon the main line of
forts between Souville and Tavannes. The
ravine is closely boxed in by the Caillette
woods to the north and Chapitre wood to
the south, and hill 32*), where the French
position forms its root to the west. German
attacks here met with a certain
measure of success, but at heavy cost, and
their footing is by no means sure enough
to prevent their being dislodged by counter
attacks, which it is believed the
French will not fail to make.
East of the ravine, however, the
enemy made no headway whatever.
Here the French lines which command
the approaches to Souville are under attack.
They rest on three woods, Fumin
to the left, Chenois to the right and
the wood running from Vaux fort to
the slopes of Souville on the center.
The last-named wood is the objective
of the Germans, for, since it runs out in
the salient toward Vaux fort, all their
other attacks are subjected to a flanking
Are from it. They succeeded in obtaining
a footing in this wood Wednesday
night after four costly attacks,
but lost a large part of their gain
Thursday. Further attempts made yesterday
were defeated by the curtain of
fire of the French artillery.
Official Report of Conflict.
The text of the latest French state
"On the left bank of the River Meuse
there has been continued great activity
on the part of the artillery in the Avocourt
wood, at hill 304 and at Dead Man
hill. A German attack with hand
grenades upon our positions at hill 304
has been repulsed.
"On the right bank of the river the
battle continued with ferocity all last
night on the western portion of this
front. Our counter offensive movements.
conducted with vigor, made it
possible for us to recapture in the vicinity
of hills 320 and 321 a large portion
of the ground recently lost there by us
and to drive the enemy back as far as
the outskirts of the Thiaumont work.
This the Germans still hold.
"The fighting became particularly
violent in the outskirts of the village
of Fleury.
"Between the woods of Fumin and
Chenois our counter attacks put us
again in complete possession of those
trenches which the enemy occupied
during the night of June 21-22. The
bombardment of the enemy was an
ewerea wnn energy Dy our Dattenes,
and this flre was maintained with intensity
from the River Meuse to a point
to the east of the Chenois wood.
"According: to the latest information
as to the result of the German offensive
actions yesterday evening: on the rig;ht
bank of the River Meuse, these movements
were conducted by the enemy in
superior numbers, six divisions taking:
part.

the explosion of three mines, but no
damage resulted.'* ^
