THE- PRIMARY ELECTION LAW.
'Iypiici Views of Two Promlnent
D)emocatic i'WlespelrM.
'1)h- Loui.:iana DtJeotcrat, publish
Sed at Alexaidria, and the Ruston
leader arce neWspapers whose De
nmoeiacy is antainted and unquestion
lable, hence their 'ipinions on the sub
ject of the primary election law
pending in the Louisiana general as
sembly and nidorsed by the Demo
cratic canicu of that body are at least
,,,titled to respectful considertationr
The Democrat says;
"There has been considerable dis
't.is ioun r'oing on in the press relative
to the primary election law now pend
ing before the legislature, in which
it ,oy viewpoints are expressed. We
I,, live the general assembly will err
if it enacts into law the primary mn.as
ure endorsed by the Democratic cau
cus. Democracy can not he forced
upon men who are not inclined in
that direciton, and we do not believe
a law providing that a voter who par
tIieipates in a Democratic primary
mlir t vote in the general election for
the nominee, under penalty of being
punished for failure to do so, could
eveCr lc made to work effectively.
"Meni who do not consider a moral
obili-t:tioO binding could not ,., 'frec
.d to respect a legal obligation, as
long as the secret ballot obtains,
hence such a law could never be en
forced, and we believe would have the
efcIect of driving men out of the I em
ocratic party, This we do not want
to do. but on the contrary, we want
Wht' erring irother, who will probably
see the error of his way, to come
Iback into the fold,"
Commenting upon this subject, the
Iusmon Leader says:
t" !aw that says men must or
must not do certain things without a
penalty -attached to it is just about
: o ineffectual as a hornet without a
stinger, To say that a man shall vote
in the regular election for the man
he helpl; noli(nate, with no penalty
to punish violation of the law, would
be ridiculous.
"To punish him for failing to com
ply with the law would be to deprive
him of his right of franchise, So
there you at e between two horns of a
dilemma, both of which are objection
able. Such-a law can not he enforc
ed unless the secret ballot law is
repealed, and the secret ballot is one
of the best features of our election
law.
"'The test thing the legislature
could do would he to repeal the pri
mary election law and leave the mat
ter in the hands of the political
parties, where it belongs. A law that
can not he enforced is a dead letter
-a farce. too ailburd for legislators
to ikdtl,.tg ill.
"Oui' election laws should he re
m, ,eled and simplified. The more
,;impl1.' they varle mnd the fewer elec
tions we hold the better it is for the
people. As it. is now there are al
ways two primaries, and when the
electors have voted iln two of them a
majority stop there and do not vote
ilt the eleelion. Really, the man re
ceiving the largest number of votes in
the first prinmary, if there is a primary,
should be the nominee; he nearly al
ways is anyway."

VOTES FOR• WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Confe'ence.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
How the National Parties Stand o:
Woman Suffrage.
Every national political platforn
now contains a plank for woman suf
frage. The Progressive plank de
clares for equal suffrage by state anc
national amendment.
The Republican plank reads: "The
Republican party, reaffirming its
faith in governmeiit of the people,
by the people and for the people, as
a measure of justice to one-half of
the people of this country, favors
the extension of the suffrag~e to wo
men, but recognizes the right of each
state to settle this" question for it
self."
The Democratic plank is: "'We
recommend the extension of suffrage
to women by the states upon the
same terms as to men."
The analysis of these planks is
simple. T'il Progressive :advooates
amendments to state and national
constitutions. Both:Republicans and
Democrats specify states rights meth
ods. This was the means asked by
the Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference, and is the acceptable
route for southern states, while it in
no sense conflicts with any other por
tiol: of our country.
Democratic Champions.
Like a hero, with a sublime cause
for championship, Senator Pittman
stood courageously and determinedly
before the Democratic convention
and pleaded the justice of votes for
wormen. When a few uproarious
anti-suffragists endeavored to howl
him down, Senator Pittman shouted:
'Are you men who are willing to
hear women denounced, afraid to
iear a man say anything in their be
half?" There was a shamed silence
while Senator Pittman continued:
"These gertlemen may not believe
their mothers and sisters possess their
brain power, but I also know the con
litiols in the sweat shops of New
York and Chicago, .Where girls have
no fathers or brothers to vote for
them, and if the Democratic conven
tion does not vote to give them the
right it is not the progressive con
vention the people believe it to be."
Another eloquent advocate of votes
for wormen was Senator Walsh of
Montana. He referred to the "bright,
brainy women" who had appeared be
fore the resolutions- committee, and
he pointedly rebuked the New Jersey
elation, tvl, inch ' a- , few
franchisement, by :reminding them
;hat the same element in that
rtate also opposed President Wilson
n all his measures. That put a
uietus on the obstreperous antis.
in final passage the suffrage plank
got rousing applause from the men in
;he convention.
At the Democratic .Cionavetion.
The southern members of the res
olutions committee were filled with
pardonable pride when a representa
tive of the southland appeared to
present a suffrage plank for the com
mittee's consideration. The New
York and St. Louis newspapers re
port: "A bright yellow sash bearing
the legend 'Votes for Women' flash
ed before the committee. It was
hung across the dashing figure of a
speaker introduced as Miss Kate M.
Gordon of Louisiana. She wore
black and presented a stunning ap
pearance."
"The southern women," she said,
squaring off before the Dixie repre
sentatives, "rate as the political in
feriors of the negro."
That made the delegation sit up
and take notice.
"Women are in the subject class,"
she went on. "The strongest indict
ment against our government of to
day is that women are maintained in
the subject class. The women of the
country are going to the party that
gives them the most recognition. We
all recognize the allegiance the ne
gro gives to the party that gave him
liberty. Is it reasonable to suppose
that women will be any less grateful
to the party that gives them liberty?"
-Didn't Know What He Was Talking
About.
One of the funny incidents of
the Democratic convention was hear
ing Governor Ferguson of Texas talk
about something he didn't know any
thing about, namely, woman suffrage,
Texas hasn't woman suffrage and as
Senator Stone of Missouri said of
Governor Ferguson, "He makes a man
of straw and then demolishes it."
The convention laughed its approval
of this criticism of the Texas gover
nor's wild statements. It was signifi
'ant that the states in which women
now have the bldlot voted unanimous
ly for the platform plank recom
mending woman suffrage. These
states know what they are talking
about, while Governor Ferguson was
merely theorizing.

CHAMPION HERD FOUNDED,
McCall Faxmn to Breed Blue-Blooded
Shorthorns on Big Scale
E. J. McCall, who in two years ha;
fought his way to the front among
I the swine breeders of the south, has
laid plans to gain similar supremacy
as a breeder of champion Shorthorn
beef cattle. Cattle require larger in
vestment than hogs, beside the de
velopment of the business being much
slower. Wide-awake Orleanians have
become convinced of the splendid op
portunity, and of the equipment of
the young Louisiana stockman to
carry out his plans to triumph, and
they have willingly added their means
to his own, so thlre appears nothing
now in the way of success.
A year or so ago Mr. McCall nmade
a trip to the Taft ranch in Texas, and
the personal equation rather than any
commercial consideration resulted in
his being fortunate enough to secure
Watson, one of the most promising
Shorthorn bulls in the country, The
magnificent young animal has more
than borne out expectations. He won
prizes wherever shown last fall, but
he is a much grander specimen today,
weighing 2000 pounds in ordinary
condition. While the cows to which
he was bred were of pure blood, they
were not the highest quality mates
for such a bull. Nevertheless, the
calves were snapped up with such
avidity that the breeder was con
vinced that with more and finer cows
he could establish a herd that would
command national attention. So,
with his new arrangement completed,
he is going after the best. He has
gone to Fort Worth and other points,
to look through the Scofield and other
famous herds, and his quest is the
finest carload ever brought to Louisi
ana. R. W. Kiser, the beef specialist
on the state extension staff, will ac
company him as adviser, and will at
the same time purchase a carload of
thoroughbreds and a few carloads of
grades for several other Louisiana
concerns expanding in the industry
in which the state will be the leader
when the tick is eradicated. In that
work, too, Mr. McCall has been ac
tive and influential.
In the swine industry Mr. McCall
selected the Jersey Duroc hog as his
specialty and has made a reputation
for himself and the state. He de
veloped Louisiana Defender into
what was generally conceded to be
the southern champion. Perpetuat
ing the most desirable characteristics
and breeding up new ones, he has
gone constantly forward toward the
ideal. Expert judges are of the
opinion that his McCall D., a son of
Louisiana Defender, is already su
perior tQ his sire and he has not yet :
provermetr4i They say he wii bl a
hard animal to beat by any comer at
the fairs, and Mr. McCall has been
advised to enter him for competition
in the International this year. Mr.
McCall has combined the Model
Cherry with the Defender strain, and
has evolved a breed which seems to
have met with so much favor among
the breeders and farmers that he is
unable to keep up with the demand
without bringing his foundation herd
under the limit of sufficiency and
safety. Although he still has a herd
of about 350, it does not take long to
deplete the stock when orders for
batches of twenty-five come in quick
succession. So he decided it impera
tive to increase the herd, and as soon
as possible he will make a tour of the
new herds and strains all over the
country, which have come to the front
since his own made its.beginning, and
will pick out a hundred sows of the
finest type to replenish the ranks. He
will look for qualities which he de
sires to build into the type he has
been producing, so that he may
achieve his ambition to become the
best Duroc breeder.
Still another development which
Mr. McCall has in mind is the raising
of mules, being confident that they
can be produced here as well as in
any other section and the market be
ing always attractive. He expects to
find a prize jack in Kentucky, and will
also buy a number of big grade Per
cheron mares to foal the mules.
These mares will at the same time
earn their keep by performing the
work on the farm, for the farm is as
important a part of the enterprise as
the stock. - The superiority of Louis
iana as a stock state comes through
her ability to grow forage cheaply
and in abundance. The buying of
feed takes away the profit in cattle.
Mr. McCall has grown corn, alfalfa,
clover, oats, soya beans, velvet beans,
peanuts and rape, and has fodder
enough for ' double the number of
stock he will muster this year. As ain
extra insurance policy for the winter
he is putting up a big silo. So he i
playing the game according to the
proven rules of science, putting his
brain as well as his brawn into the
work, and will set a valuable example
to the farmers who are trying out
Louisiana's possibilities.
The new concern has a capital stock
of $40,000, and the new blood is C.
B. Fox, the local grain magnate, and
Julius C. Werner, the prominent bag
manufacturer. Mr. McCall is ,the
president and manager; his brothet
Henry C(., the well known lawyer,
secretary-treasurer; Mr. Werner, the
vice-president, and Mr. Fox completes
the directory, which is more interest
ed in future expansion than immedi
ate profit, although the two years of
McCall operation have been profitable
enough to more than justify and en
courage further investment.
