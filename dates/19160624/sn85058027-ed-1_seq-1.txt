Ore Extraction
I Resumed At Big
I Pacific Mine
BIG VEIN SAID TO CONTAIN $2,500,000 ABOVE TUNNED
LEVEL.
I Supt. Carl Ferlin, Sunday completed taking up the old stool
in the Pacific mine and replacing it with lG-pound rails. The
slinrp corners have been taken out of the drifts. The track
is now so oven that the cars are pushed in with ease and the
muckers can ride coming out. The company now has four mine
cars with which to extract ore, two of which have ball bearing
wheels.
Men wore put to work break-,
ins down the high grade cop
ier dance rock, samples of
which assayed as high as 512
ninces in silver and 215 per
cut copper. There is said to
c over $100,000 of ore in this
tope and when returns from
tcome in from the smellers it
jW expected to create a mild
onsntion in mining circles.
B One authority writing for a
nit Lake paper stales that the
ig vein has been opened for a
istnnee of 500 feet north, that

Tho mill ore is said to average
$10 per ton, all of which if true
would give tho mill oro alone
exposed a value of over $2,500

of the high grade shules in tho
vein.
At any- rale from now on the
extraction of ore will proceed
rapidly and prospecting on tho
big fissure will be continued
so that more oro bodies will be
opened up. For tho present
there will be nothing done be
