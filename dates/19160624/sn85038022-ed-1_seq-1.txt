TWO AMERICAN TROOPS
PRACTICALLY WIPED OUT
Soven Survivors All That Reported Littlo Force of Pershing's Men
Almost Surrounded Under Cover of tho Parley Between Captain
Boyd and General Gomez and Aro Raked From Three Sides
LED INTO TRAP FROM WHICH
FORCE OPENED ON
None of tho Stragglers Able To Give Any Information As To the
Fato of Remnant of tho Eighty-Fivo Soldiers
Composing tho Command
San Antonio, Texas, Juno 23 The
two troops of tho Tenth Cavalry under
Captain Charles T. lloyd, practically
were wiped out by tho nttack of Mex
ican forces under General Gomez nt
Carrizal, Juno 21, according to In
formation given In fragmentary reportB
received by General Funston from
General Pershing tonight.
General Pershing's message statcu
that seven survivors in all. Including
those who arrived laBt night, had
reached 'tho main column. All were
enlisted men but the report did not say
whether thero wero non-commissioned
oflicers among them.
According to tho story of tho sur
vivors, as outlined In General Persh
ing's report, tho mounted force of Mex
icans mmlo a chargo from the llanlt
at tho conclusion of a parley between
General Gomez and Captain Itoyd, at
tbo same tlmo that a machine gun
opened flro from tho front ns General
Gomez reached his line.
Captain Uoyd had ordered his men
to dismount as tho machine gun opened
flro and tho combined effect of tho
Mexican chnrge, tho machine gun (Ire
and tho rlflo flro from tho Mexican gar
rlson of Carrizal, which had almost
surrounded tho littlo American force
under cover of tho parley sought by
General Gomez to discuss whether
Captain Doyd should bo allowed to
pass through tho town, stampeded tho
horses. No details wero made kown
to General Pershing as to whether tho
Mexican chargo was checked.
Firing On Three Sides
Without their mounts, and without
means of escape, ringed about on three
sides with tho flro of nn overwhelming
force, tho fate of tho littlo detachment
Is believed by officers here to have
been scaled, It Is feared that only
tho most stupendous luck backed by
desperate valor, could hnvo extricated
Captain Boyd's men from tho trap.
The report from Mexican forces
placed tho number of killed, Including
two officers, nt from 12 to 40. It Is
reported that 17 wero taken as prison
ers Into Chihuahua City.
Tho accepted percentage ot wounded
to thoso killed In modern warfare
would placo tho wounded at Trom 35
to 40 at tho lowest estimate. The
strength of tho two troops, G. and K,
Is not known here, but it ns estimated
that they could not have exceeded 130
men, allowing for thoso sick and on de
tached service.
With only soven survivors reported
an arriving at tho main column the
number of men accounted for, at least
speculatively, Is pitiably small.
Captain Morey Deud or a Prisoner
Field Headquarters, Colonln Dublan,
Chihuahua, via wireless to Columbus,
N. M., Juno 23 That Captain Morey Is
olthor dead or a prisoner was tho the
conclusion reached hero tonight when
no report had been received from any
of tho throo oflicers who accompanied
tho troops of tho Tenth Cavalry en
gaged nt Carrizal Wednesday. Mexi
can reports said Captain Charles T.
Uoyd nnd Lieutenant Henry Adair wore
among tho dead. Although sixty hours
nnvo elapsed slnco tho fight, tho only
word of It has been brought to General
Pershing by nlno enlisted men who
straggled Into camp yesterday.
Thcso men all Insisted that General
Gomez, tho Mexican commander, and
Captain Doyd In parley apparently
wero rcacmng an amicable conclusion
and that Immediately afterward the
Americans wero led Into n trap from
which tho Mexicans opened flro upon
them with concealed machine guns. ,
Joono of tho stragglers reaching
hero wns nblo to glvo any Information
as to tho fato of tho remnant of tho 85
men composing tho command.
Morey Probably Anion),' tho Wounded
KI Paso, Texas, Juno 23 Military
authorities In El Paso last night gen
erally reached tho conclusion that tho
officer referred to us Captain Mooro
nnd reported to hnvo been wounded In
tho action at Carrizal, wns Captain
Lowls S. Morey. of Troop K. Tenth
Cavalry.
It was pointed out that If ho was tho
only surviving officer of tho command
his wounds may have prevented his
reporting to General Porshlng immed
iately. General Pershing, according to his
report, had received no word from tho
two battalions ot the Eloventh Cavalry
which ho had sent to roscuo tho rem
nants ot Captain Uoyd's expedition. He
stated that ho had taken no measure
to support tho squadron of tho Elov
