"With the cheers of patriotic
thousands ringing: in their
ears with the sobs and good
byes of each particular moth
er, wife or sweetheart gripping
their hearts, Company L, First
Infantry, I. N. €L, left Keokuk
t.iria morning at 7 o'clock for
Camp Dodge. What may be in
the future for the boys who so
gaily marched down the street
thi« morning, and with smiles
and a cheer boarded the train,
no one knows. Whether they
go or whether they are not
needed, they showed them
selves ready, and Keokuk as
in 1861 and again in 1898,
turned out to bid them good
bye and Godspeed. The crowd
at the station was packed in
so tightly that it was almost
impossible to move. They
had to be pushed back on both
sides as the troops marched
down Mfthi street. Everyone
who could, grasped the hand
of some friend or acquaintance
as he walked up the platform
to the coaches waiting to carry
the poldiers to Des Moines.
Those who couldn't get near
enough to touch hands, cheered
and called goodbyes and all
sorts of good advice such as
not fbo let the greasers get
them, and to be sure and bring
back a flag. Then just before
the train movcfcl, the Elks, U.
C. T.'s and others carrying
Hags stepped to the side of the
train, and Company L's spe
cial moved out between the
wagl of American flags, the
crowd shouting itself hoarse,
while few sobbed unre­

strained.^, and the members of
the company leaned out of the
windows and cheered.
Whatever new fangled ap
pliances modern warfare has
employed, the saying of good
byes is not changed1 one bit.
There was the crowd on both
sides of Main street all the
way to Water street. Automo
biles were parked along the
east side of this street and
vantage points such as freight
cars and telephone poles were
eagerly snapped up. Along
the sidewalk in little groups,
their eyes red from weeping,
stood mothers, sisters, wives
and sweethearts of the boys in
irhflJri who were whistling
and smiling1 as they marched
down the street in heavy
marching order. And at the
train the scenes of '61 and '98
were gone over again. A moth
er rushed out from the crowd
for a last goodbye, and a
trooper stepped off the coach
to gather his sweetheart into
his arms for a farewell kiss and
a murmured word of endear
ment. And the crowd was
momentarily gripped with the
pathos of it all, but it's pa
triotism rose above its pathos,
and cheers broke out again.
Not all of the mothers of wives
were at the depot, either, to see the
boys depart. Some there were who,
on sick beds, too ill to be moved,
could picture in their minds eyes the
parade down Main street, and silent
tears coursed down their faces. Others
there were who, old and feeble, sup

away from the crowd lest toe grief
of parting prove too much for their

WASHINGTON. June 24.—The
question of an armed invasion of Mex
ico hangs today upon the nature of
t&e first report of any commissioned
officer who participated in the Car
rizal fight, if any are alive.
Fallowing a conference with Presi
dent Wilson, lasting on© hour, Secre
tary of War Baker at 11 o'clock said:
"We are obliged to wait for further
word from General Pershing before
we can determine our course of ac
tion."
"The only thing we have thus far,
aside from that coming from. Mexican
sources, is the report of a few strag
glers who were considerably in the
rear of the point where the-Carrizal
attack occurred," Baker said.

the others went forward. Apparently
when the firing started and our
horses began to stampede, these men
scampered away so that they were
not near the P1ace where the parley
ing was going on and' probably were
considerably back when the shooting
began.
"We are compelled to wait, there
fore," he said, "until we hear from the
two troops of cavalry sent out to
bring back what remains o" the troops
engaged in the Carrizal fight. Until
we get that report, there is absolute

EL PASO, Texas, June 24.—The
fate of sixty men, reported to have
escaped from the scene of the Car
ranzista ambush at Carrizal, was still
unknown here early today. Whether
they were pursued by the Mexican
cavalry and cut down on the desert
or perished from lack of water was
unascertalnable.
Army officers and state department
agents here, believing that the two
troops of the Tenth cavalry were vir
tually wiped out, declared today that
war probably could not be avoided.
The absence of word from the relief
column of the Eleventh cavalry in
creased fears that they also may have
been engaged by the Carranzistas, or
were combing the hilly, barren coun
try around Carrizal for survivors of
Wednesday's unequal battle.
An embargo on exports to Mexico,
particularly arms, ammunition and
food stuffs Is in force along the bor
der. Information received by army
officers indicates that the Carranzistas
plan to evacuate practically all bor
der points in case of war. Occupa
tion of Juarez is considered certain
to follow open hostilities.
Captain Lewis Morey and two lieu
tenants, names unknown, are reported
to have been among the escaped
American troopers. Moroy was des
perately wounded. Without proper
medical attention, be must have died,
it is feared.
Word from the rescue column was
anxiously awaited. They are expect
ed to report burying the dead Ameri

Only Seven Escaped.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 24.—
Army fears and hopes of exact tid
ings of the fate of approximately 100
Americans troopers ambushed at
Carrizal, rested today on the relief
squadron of the Eleventh cavalry,
dispatched by General Pershing im
mediately after word of the encount
er reached his headquarters. There
was a feeling here that the failure to
receive any word from this relief
squadron was of Itself sinister in its
