on the Carranza government that steps must be taken to get

two more companies will be picked

A crowd estimated at 1,500 peo
ple gave the boys in brown a fare
well greeting. Sandwiched tightly
in it was the Studebaker band,
which did heroic work in enliven
ing the rather sad parting. It was
rushed out on 30 minutes' notice.
Among the feminine portion of
the crowd there was hardly a dry
eye. It was a brother, sweetheart
or a father who was leaving. Few
knew how many would return. One
thing however, seems certain; Co.
I' will not leave Indianapolis before
the next ."0 days. That much time
will be needed to give the hoys

from the assembled crowd. Shortly
after, the band arrived, and struck
up patriotic airs. While orders were
being issued by Capt. Rogers and

its lusty work.
As the men beared the coaches
in readiness to , limb on. men and
women struggled desperately to get

in the crowd who could not get near
enough on the platform climbed up

JUAREZ III WEEK
Military Authorities at El Paso
Are Prepared to March
Across Border.
International New Servier
! EL PASO. Texas. June j 4 Un
less there is a decided change for the
better in the situation very shortly,
an American army of invasion will
take Juarez within a week, and very
shortly thereafter, move southward
down the railway line in Mexico to
Villa Ahumada and Chihuahua City.
This well founded report was
spread broadcast along the border
today and even crossed the Rio
Grande into Juarez itself.
There it aroused the anger and de
fiance of the Mexican leaders. This
formal defiance was issued by Andres
Garcia, Carranza consul in El Paso,
who has spent most of his time in
Juarez fdnce the situation became
acute:
"If it is the plaji to attack Juarez,
the American armv will rind us readv
We are not going to give up without,
a fight that will give a new idea uf
the ability of Mexico's soldiers.
Every ore of our citizens is ready to
take up arms."
(uns rnmasUcd.
While Garcia was thus defying the
might of the United States. Carran
zista soldiers, with rifles ready and
machine guns unmasked, took up
their position at the Mexican end of
the International bridge. They were
grim evidence that the Mexicans in
tend to tight. Indeed, there was no
doubt of this intention on the border
after the Mexican government as
sumed responsibility for the attack
on American soldiers at Carrizal.
This assumption removed the issue
from the field of diplomacy.
For a long time they have been
heartenirg their men with stories
that the Americans are "afraid" and
hundreds of Mexican troops actual
ly believe it.
The la:k of aeroplanes is causing
the greatest worry to the otticers who
are aware of the plans to move into
Mexico. It is known that sky scouts
have been requested from the gov
ernment, but for some reason or
other there has been no response.
Tills, despite the lesson learned at
Carrizal. where a single scout plane
mifiht have avoided the trapping of
the 10th cavalry soldiers or at least
carried news of the treachery back
to Pershing within a couple of hours
Army is Rlind.
If the aeroplane is the eve of the
modern army the I'nited States army
seems quite blind.
Despite CJarcia's defiant e it seem
ed quite likely that the first real
fighting -will be encountered back of
the hills of Juarez, where it is re
ported that the garrison that evacu
ated" with such ostentatious secrecy,
is taking: positions to harass tin
American advance.
Passing through this, the American
troops may expect their Jirst r-al
battle at Villa Ahumada. In that
district between 6.0 arai
",00"
Mexican troops are massed.
Acainst them from Kl Paso ar.dj
through .fuare, the armv may send
4.000 or 3, 000 men. This providing

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 24. Sixteen survivors of th
10th cavalry which was attacked by Mexicans at Carrizal, have

party also recovered 45 horses.
Gen. Pershing's report, the third received from the commander
