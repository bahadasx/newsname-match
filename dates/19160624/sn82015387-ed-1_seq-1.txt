When the restricted district was
removed from Covington by ordi
nance of the town council, there was
a general clean-up. Public senti
ment had been thoroughly aroused
against conditions that existed at
that time, and it was thought that a
pretty thorough job had been made
of it. Later it began to be rumored
that there were some places under
suspicion, being ostensibly private
residences. Recently a real estate
agency rented a house to a woman
who said she was Mrs. Ollie Smith;
that her husband worked in the
Ramsay saw mill and would be home
every night and that she might take
a few boarders. Everything seem
ed all right end the lease was closed
Saturday night, June 17, Deputy
'Ed. Lacroix arrested the woman and
her companion, charging them witl
running a house of ill-repute. They
gave the names of Ollie and Mamie
Ard. They were brought before
Mayor Lacroix and the agent who
rented them the house was called
in and asked if he did not know i
was against the law to rent houses
for such a purpose. ,He answered
that he did, but he was not aware
that the house was to be used for a
disreputable purpose, but accepted
the" woman as given above. Under
the circumstances he was exhonor
ated.
Each woman was fined $25 and
costs or thirty days in jail. The;
were not able to pay their fines and
were placed in the town tail, but
were later transferred to the parisi
jail, as the town jail was not con
sidered to be just the place in which
to keep them thirty days.
Mayor Lacroix announced that he
would not stand for a violation o'
the ordinance, and that every wo
man brought before him, with e
deuce to convict, would be punished
jury adjourn until next meeting July
5, 1914.

F. and A. M. Hold Out
ing at Jackson Park.
Last Wednesday aaternoon at a
meeting especially called for the
purpose, the town council, with May
or W. E. Davis .presiding, James
Hutchinson at his desk, Messrs. Jno.
L. Smith, James Band, A. Hartman,
A. Depre, present, and C. B. Wills
absent, assembled with rolled up
t sleeves, blood in its eyes and clench
ed fists, determined to take a strangl
er's hold on the sea wall jinx and rel
egate it to the deminifion bpw-wows.
Among the large audience present
were nmany property-holders, engin
, eers, contractors, andib.iflders,- both
local and foreign. Sea wall proposi
tions of various kinds were submit
ted and discussed from every angle
when, like a thunderbolt from a clear
sky, there came an offer, that after
being dissected and thorough4' di
gested, was admitted an ideal propo
sition, and everybody present, even
ancecompetitors, advocated. its ac
ceptance. 'Twas this: lMr. Black,
senior member of the Black-Iaird
Construction Co., in a well modulated
and Irish accentuated voice, said,
"Gentlemen, I will complete (and he
dwelled on complete) you se waHl
in from three to six months, depend
ing on weather conditions, aecording
to the original specifications, for
$20,800.00, payable in cash as the
work progresses, and I'll give you a
gift edge bond for your protection."
The deal was closed, conditioned on
the approval of the respective attor
neys, who met yesterday, and as the
reader scans this afjicle the sea wall
will again be a going concern on its
last lap to completion.
As the good news rapidly spread
through the town it.wras greeted with
expressions of hearty approval and
exultration.
In albout fifteen'days the work will
commence at the elistward, and on
the new lines, to give a much need
ed protection to,ptoperty at that end
when the entire beach asid some part
of the streets has beeni washed away
depriving the east end residents o!
a public highway.
Some of the belch. front propprty
owners have bees hemminag, hawing
and even refusing to agree to the ei
tra contribution -to the ,ea wall fund
unless given poeiltTe proof of a fin
ished sea wal, Now they can nc
longer stand back,. the props .lav

der them. They. an offer no tangible
reason for not agreeing to pay the:_
share of the assessment and thereb;
assist and enco1ar tie the oMelals
contractors and other property hold
ers, for nothing short of a miracle
and those t'mes have passed, can
prevent the early completion of tlb
sea wall.

that the company complete the joh
