COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED.
Two Troops in Carrisai Battle Widely
Scattered After Fight.
San Antoriio, June
24.—Complete
dis
organizing of the two troops that were
In the Carrizal fight Wednesday- morn
ing with Carranza troops and the an
nihilation of those in the fight was in
dicated in a report from Pershing to
Funston today.
Eight enlisted men of troop and
seven men of troop were picked up
yesterday morning by Lieutenant Mey
er near Santa Maria. The story they
told was almost the same as that told
by the other stragglers who preceded
them.
Wounded Men Captured.
General Pershing in his report today
referred to the number, of those who
had returned to the American lines as
eleven, altho in other dispatches he
fixed the number at seven. With those
who were rescued J»y Lieutenant Mey
er the total number returned was 27.
The total number of men In the two
troops was learned today to have been
eighty-four. General Pershing offer
ing a summary of his information and
explaining that his conclusions were
based on such information as he had
secured from the stragglers and from
press report?- called attention to the
indications that there were fifty-seven
missing and that press reports said
fourteen of these had been killed and
forty-three are prisoners. General
Pershing did not account in his report
for the number wounded, but appears
to assume that all wounded had been
captured.
1
He stated that hie had received a
report" ftitan the commanders of both
squadrons of. the Eleventh cavalry that
:r«*tfMh«ldsri Ratrest Early.
All those brought in by- Lieutenant
Meyer was householders, and like those
coming Into camj»- yesterday were not
in the fight. They had had difficulty,
they said, in. handling the horses when
the machine gun and rifle fire began
and retreated before the conclusion of
the engagement.
They had cared for suph horses as
they could round up after they got
beyond range of the fire, the full num
ber of mounts in their possession when
found by Lieutenant Meyer being
twenty-five.
The troopers told their storiees- today
before they had. re-entered the camp
or had an opportunity to talk with
stragglers Who had come in before
tHem. The accounts they gave were
said to have, borne out in all details
those told previously.
Verify Gomez's Treachery.
They said they saw General Gomez
and his aide ride forward to parley
with Captain Boyd and later saw him
move towards the flank of the Mexican
troops that had begun closing on the
American force. According t9 "the
story, the first intimation any «5ne had
th»t hostilities were going to come was
an outburst of machine gun fire. They
corroborate the story that said it was
not until then that Captain Boyd gave
the order for his men to dismount and
rettirn the fire. The Mexicans during
the parley had crowded forward and
assumed such positions that when they
attacked they were in position to
sweep with the killing lire the Ameri
can line stating exposed in the open.
Officers at General Funston's head
quarters seemed convinced that after
studying General Pershing's report
that all of the two troops that would
be found now would be wounded and
that therefore the battered remnant
could not have moved very far.
TROOPERS feOT WIPED OUT.

ports to indicate that the entire band

Secretary Baker For First Time Re
fuses to Discuss Situation With
Newspapers—Retaliatory Measures
May Result in Occupation of All of
Northern Mexico by American
Troops.
Washington, June 24.—Relations be
tweens the United States and the de
facto, government of Mexico are close
to the bi^asking point today as a, result
of the belief that American cavalrymen
were deliberately massacred Wednes
day at Carrizal by Carranza soldiers.
Secretaries Lansing and Baker were
at the White House early today to con
fer with theu resident. It is known
that the possibility of drafting retali
atory action against the Mexican gov
ernment forccs in Chihuahua was given
grave, consideration. On going back
Secretary Lansing, for the first time
since he became secretary of state,
canceled his morning ngagement with
newspaper men. He sent word by his
private secretary that there was noth
ing he could give'out at this time. It
the Carranza government accepts re
sponsibility Ijr the attacw it Is held
by officials that occupation of most of
northern Mexico will be ordered by
President Wilson to take place as soor.
as military force can be placed at the
disposal of General Funston.
Action must await further report
from General Pershing. His message
indicating that only a few men of the
two troops of cavalry had survived in
addition to those taken prisoners had
not been supplemented at an early
hour.
It is said the first act of the Wash
ington government when fuller infor
mation is at hand will be to demand
repudiation of the Carrizal attack by
the Carranza government.' Preflminary
reports have convinced the officials
here that the American troops were de
liberately led/Into a trap.
Unqualified repudiation cf the attack
and immediate surrender of the pris
oners probably wil be demanded.
Awaits More Details.
Secretary Baker said this morning
after his conference with the president
that no Immediate change In the pol
icy was contemplated by the UnlteJ
States and that no new military order*
were planned.
Secretary Baker in reply to a query
as to whether the United States had
requested the release of the prisoners
captured at Carrizal said:
"I can not discuss thd subject now."
Secretary Lansing emerged from the
White House about ten minutes after
Baker. He turned to the newspaper
men and said:
"I can not say a word."
Mr. Baker pointed that the only in
formation regarding the Carrizal fight
except from Mexican sources had come
from a few stragglers who were not in
the thick of the fight, being occupied
as horse holders In caring for the
troopers' mounts at the rear. The war
department held !t CSScutia! to get the
etorles of the men, especially officers,
who were on the fighting front in th»
engagement.
Nothing to Mediate.
News that some of the South and
Central American republics are pre
paring to make offers of mediation In
the crisis between the linked States
and Mexico drew* from high officials
here today a strong Intimation that
the United States is engaged only in
protecting Its own people and property
and that There is nothing to mediate,
so fsr as the policy of this government
is concerned.'
Altho Ecuador and Savador have au
thorized their ministers to confer with
their colleagues on the subject, the
state department does not expect any
overtures at once from the body of
Latin American diplomats. It is under
