Rev. C. Van deVen, bishop of Alex- I
anaria, La., clothed in his episcopal I
robes ,occupied a throne A in theb
sanctuary which was beautifully t
decoratbd by the joung' ladies of l
Grand Coteau. The mass was sung a
by the Small Boys' College choir il
and they carried themselves with 'I
glory on the oecasion, It was the I
first time they attempted anything's
of this kind. t
The ten graduates who were v
dressed in their graduation uni- 1
formafilled the first twdo iews in f
the main aisle. TPhe balance of. the .`
middle pews were, taken up by the t
alumni and edllege; students. The v

gation also attended the mass.
Bishop Van de Ven preachedi a
beautiful Baccalaureate sermon.
After thanking the Je;uits for their a
kind invitation to be presenton' this c
auspicious occasion he exhorted the
members of the graduating class to .
live up to the good. christian train- e
ing they had received from the Jes
uits. In part the bishop said: i
"Higher education without religion
is absolutely worthless for it. is '
filling up our penitenti8ies nd
Jails. What we need in the,world'
at the present day is good christian '
men." I
Immediately after maps Solemn t
Benediction of the Blessed Sacra
ment was given during which the
Te Deum was' sung. The ceremo
nies of the church were inspiring.
It was a beautiful sight to see the 1
old college boys fromn as far back
as the civil war to the present day
graduate taking a stroll beneath the
magnilleent live" oaks -planted
nearly one hundred years ago.
Here they related many instances
of their'school days and the happy
time they had at dear old St.

CITY WILL CONSIDER
TRUCK NEXT TUESDAY
Special Meeting to Be Held for
Purpose of Deciding Plan
COMMITTEE ENJOYS TRIP TO
BATON ROUGE LAST WEEK
Fire. Boys Feel Confldent That
Their Efforts Will Prove Sue
cessful With, City Council
It is very likely that Opelousas
will own' an automobile fire truck;
so inca" interest has been mani
fested in the proposition that a
special meeting of the city council
to take up the matter has been
called for Tuesday night.
A committee composed of Mayor
'Loeb, Aldermen Stelly and Hollier
and Chief Brown of the-fire de
partment journeyed over to Baton
Rouge ,J9t week, where they in
spected the new auto fire truck,
which was recently purchased by
the capital city . fire department.
The 'committee was driven all over
the city in the truck and every
member of the committee expressed
himself as being perfectly satisfied
that a flet* truck would prove of
benefit to this city.
. The Opelousas& fire boys have
been making, a noble fight 5lurihg
the past year in an endeavor to give
Opelotisas this much needed im
proved , flre-fighting apparatus;
the city council never turned a deaf
ear to the fire boys,' always assur
ing theras as soon as practicable the
matter would be taken up and fi
nally disposed of, by the purchase
of the fire truck.
It is evident that the city will
purchase the truck, as it is under
stood that the five members of the
council are satisfied that the pur
chase of an auto truck would
prove a profitable investment.

OPELOUSAS BOYS GOING TO THE
MEXICAN BO ER
At least three Opelousas boys
will go to the Mexican border, or
may even go into the depths of the
southern republic, if war is d
clared. The three Opelousad 3
to go to Alexantdria for the mobili
zitation of the Louisiana National
Guards are Hart and Eddie Littell,
who belong to Company H, at Ba
ton Rouge, and Robertson Lacombe
who readily enlisted at Crowley on
last Monday. Paul Roy, a former
Opelousas boy, who resides at
Crowley will also go to the front,
in case the Louisiana National
Guardsa are called to the' Mexican
border. George Phillipa, it is un
derstood, has also enlisted; while
not an Qpelousas boy, he is well
known here, where he has been
engaged in the rice business for a
number of years.
'Hart Littell departed on
the Wednesday morning Frisco
train fr- Baton Rouge, from whence
he went with other members of
Company H tb Alexandria for mo
bilization. The other young men
went with the Crowley company.
Eddie Littell after standing a
competetitive examination for West
Point to-day, will .eave for Alex
andria to join his company.
Opelousas is never lack in fur
nishing soldiers to Uncle Sam,
whenever called on, an'd it is very
evident that should a state of .war
be declared between the two coun
tries, this city will contribute its
mite towards thei building of a
formidable band of volunteers to
battle for supremacy with the
greesers.
. Quite a number of local young
men 'have signified their desire to
follow in the footsteps of the Lit
tell boys and Rob LaCombe, in en
listing on the border or in Mexico.

Alexandre Sylvestre, metber of
the fifth wardto the police jury,
was in Opelousas on Thursday, at
tending to preparatory plans for
the erection of the proposed Syl
vestre school, in the western por
tion of the ward.
,Willie Dejean, wio represents
the Plaquemirre section of the sixth
ward of the police jury, was here
during the week. Mr. Dejean re
ported that crops were in splendid
phape in his section and predicted
bumper crops.

AMERICANS KILL 14
IN CARRIZAL FIGHT
COMMANDERS OF OPPOSING FO RCES BOTH MEET DEATH WHILE
MANY COM RADES ARE
KILLED A ND WOUNDED
The first battle between Carran
za forces and the United States
soldiers took place on the San Do
mingo ranch, near Carrizal, in
Northern Mexico, on Wednesday.
According to Mekican official ac
count of the battle there were 12
Americans, including their coin
mander, dead, and 17 prisoners,
whileldt Mexicaus were killed and
30 wounded. General Felix Gomez
led the de facto forces, but the
name of the American commander
has not been ascertained as yet. It
is thought, however, that the
American commander was Captain
Lewis Morey, of the Tenth Cavalry.
President Wilson is firm in his
belief that war can be averted and t
does not expect the Carrizal battle
to precipitate a declaration of war. I
In the meantime all national
guards have been ordered to mobil
ize and national guards of three I
states, Missouri, KIansas and Cali
fornia have already been called to
the Mexican border. The Louis
iana national guards are mobiliz
ing at Alexandria, where they will
train for use on the border in case
the United Mtates should need.
Louisiapa, it is said, can furnish
,nearly two thousand men for Ser
vice in Mexico.

OPELOUSAS EASY WINNER
OVER THE RAYN&I TEAM
Bienvenu Pitches Superb Ball
Allowing Visitors Only' Three
Hits in Seven Innings
The Opelousas baseball club
opened the season on last Sunday
evening at Comeal's park, by de
feating the Rayne team by thew de
cisive score of 13 to 3. Except for
the first inning, when the Rayne
- boys piled up three runs, not one of
- which was earned, Opelousas play
ed r:ng around roses with the visi
tprs.
S Lionel Bienvenu, local boy who
acquired a reputation as a reliable
pitcher with the Spring Hill College
r teain, was on the mound for Ope
- lousas. At flirst, because it was his
first appearance befpre a home
crowd, young Bienvenu was a trifle
, wild, but he soon settled down. The
h best that the' visitors could do with
SBienvenu was to secure three sin
gles' and two passes. At all stages
d of the game Bienvenu had the
d Rayne players at his mercy.
While Bienvenu was pitching a
- beautiful game his teammates, led
, by Charles Dejean, Tate and Clary,
t were pounding the hide off of the
f ball; Dejean carved out one three
" bagger, a two bagger and a single
v. in four times up, while Tate in as
v. many times soaked the ball out
s twice of twobaggers. Clary ob
, tained two singles, the rest of the
. players, with the exception of Leo
r Dejean and McKinney, contented
e themselves with a single a piece.
S The batting of Dejean was the
feattire of the Sunday game. Tate

When news 01 tae Datue o0 uar
rizal reached Opelousas by special
dispatches excitement prevailed,
rmany expressing the opinion that rc
a declaration of war would follow si
as soon as details of the fight could ni
be gotten. Si
In many towns and cities of Lou
isiana, and throughout the Ubited la
States, when this startling news
flashed over the ,wires, patriotic
citizens quickly organized parades ac
and patriotic demonstrations fol- fr
lowed. Baton Rouge helh a parade, 91
which has never had its equal in ti
the capital city, since the Spanish
American war.
Since the battle of the San Do- v4
ming&' ranch the Carranza forces di
have been evacuating many Mexi- w
can bolder towns, retiring further hi
south, where they are expected to
offer, resistance to invading Amer
ican forces.
The city of. Juarez, opposite El
Paso, has been practically evacu- bi
ated by the Carranza gafrison. cI
Trainloads of . soldiers and rest- si
dents have been hurried to the cc
south, and many cities along the do
international boundary lines have w

to be one of the best and swiftestl
