'I' might add that the Jefferson Highway map was published a
fewv weeks ago without proofs being sent out for correction and
that in consequence the're are several errors in the names of towns
and cities listed as permanent points on the highway. One of these
is the listing of "Marksville" which should be "Melville," and this
matter has been brought to the attention of Mr. Wright, Manager
of Publications.
Very truly yours, LucIEN E. LYONS, JR.,
.-- Vice President for Louisiana.
He Still Oppdtie Seeel Tax.
To the Voters of Ward Six -e
I will endeavor to give you an
idea as to whether we need the
5-mills special school tax or not.
I will give it to you so you can
figure on it yourselves.
The State gives this parish
$25,000 or $30,000 for her schools.
In addition to this the State gives
$60,000 to the high schools. All
the poll taxes go to the school
fund. Ward six is paying five
mills school tax, which, accord
ing to the assessment given to
me by the assessor, brings in
$3,000 per year. The assessment
of ward six is $600,000, which at
5 mills is $3,000.00, Now, the
$30,000 that the State gives the
parish is pro rated to the wards
in the parish. There are seven
wards in the parish. We have
We have five schools in the ward.
We will give the teachers fifty
dollars per month. That will be
$2,000 per year. That leaves us
$1,000. Our ward ought to get
from the State $500, that makes
$1,500 balance this year. We
have been paying this three
years. That makes $4,500 for
three years. Ward six must help 1
pay Supt. Warner's salary, which
would be about $150 per year;
three years would be $450. We
will give him $500 for the three
years. That leaves $4,000. So
you see N. S. Roberts has made
a big mistake.
Now, I will kindly ask all the
voters in ward six to come to the
polls June 27 and let us defeat
the 5-mills tax, as I don't believe
it is needed.
I. MCMILLS.
[The figures as to the State
giving the parish high schools
sixty thousand dollars are entire
ly out of reason. The high
schools of Grant parish receive
from the State less than one
twentieth of that amount. This
leaves such a big hole in Mr. Mc
Mills' statemerlt that it is not
worth consideration.-Editor.]
Daily Thought
He who loses wealth, loses mach;
he who loses a friend, loses more;
but he that loses his courage, loses
slL-Cervates.
To the Voters of Ward Six.
In school matters ward six is
inferior to any ward in Grant
parish. She cannot boast of
even a two-room school. Her
one-room buildings are more typ
ical of storm houses or potato
bunks than of institutions of
learning. She has fewer teach
ers and pays less than any ward.
Mr. I. 'McMills' missle to the
Chsonicle is self-destructive.
Sarcasm does not convince think
ing people-- If the teachers of
the ward are "little teachers"
the cause is not remote. That is
one of the evils the people are
trying to right by voting a spe
cial school tax. I have never re
ferred to the school building at
Aloha with reference to myself.
When being considered as a
teacher for the coming school
term, I remarked that I was not
the fellow for a one-room school.
I also said that the school was
but poorly serving its mission.
My friend, Mr. I. McMills, re
ferred to the floods and other
disasters that have taken place
in ward six. He and I do not
make the same discrimination as
to relative values. Had I spoken
of the misfortunes that have be
fallen ward six, the lack of edu
cational facilities and the result
ant ignorance would have headed
the list. I say this kvith all re
spect to the people of the ward.
Fathers rnd mothers of ward
six, on the 27th of this month
show how well you can acquit
yourselves. Fulfill with honor
the high trust involved upon you,
namely, the rearing of children.
Vote the tax.
C. J. CALHOUN.

Proposed Bridge at Thompson's Ferry.
The one great hope which has
been predominant in the minds
of the people of LaSalle for many
months was the construction of
a bridge across Little river at, or
near, Thompson's Ferry.
That hope, we believe, will at
an early date be realized.,
Hon. H. E. Hardtner was in
Jena on Friday of last week and
started the bridge-building ball
to rolling. He has formulated
plans whereby this greatly need
ed structure can be built, and the
project financed, without work
ing any great hardship on the
taxpayers of either this or Grant
parish, whose citizenry are equal
ly interested, and who are fully
alive to the numeroas advantages
to be derived from the proposed
connecting link between the two
parishes. Not only are the peo
ple of Grant and LaSalle alive to
the situation, but those of Rap
ides are also deeply interested,
and will, no doubt, render ma
terial assistance.
A petition is now being circu
lated for signatures requesting
the State Board of Engineers to
send a representative to the pro
posed bridge site for the purpose
of drawing plans and obtaining
estimates of probable cost, etc.
Mr. Hardtner has the assurance
of the board that this will be
done as soon as the question is
presented in a formal manner.
A strong pull and a steady pull,
with everybody pulling together,,
will accomplish the early fruition
of this long-wished-for bridge,
so let's all get together and pull,
pull, pull.--Jena Times, June 17.
Bryan's Loyalty.
If before the convention held
at St. Louis, where President
Wilson was renominated for a
second term, there was enter
tained any doubt as to William J.
Bryan's attitude, that doubt has
been dispelled. At this conven
tion Mr. Bryan was not a dele
gate but a reporter for newspa
pers, and yet his personality was
felt throughout this gathering of
more than a thousand Democrats
and the great leaders of the par- -
ty. He was not seeking recog
nition but held himself in re
serve, and yet when called to ad- I
dress this convention his pro- l
nouncement of fealty to the par
ty and to its leader, Woodrow I
Wilson, provoked an enthusiasm
that fairly shook the building
from its roof to its foundation.
The ovation tendered Mr. Bryan
was one of the greatest he has
experienced. It was a compli
mentary recognition of a man
who has always been manly, and
who has always been true to his
convictions.
In the contest for the presi
dency Bryan's influence will be
all-powerful and he will carry
great weight in the alignment of
thousands of independent voters
who will be influenced to the sup
port of Woodrow Wilson.
We have never doubted Bryan's
party loyalty. We have always
felt conservatively assured that
when the call to duty was sound
ed he wo uld respond patriotical
ly.-Shrev 'port Caucasian.

Bowel Complaints in India.
In a lecture at one of the Des Moines,
Iowa. churches a missionary from In

Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy with
him and believed that it saved his life.
This remedy is used successfully in
India both as a preventative and core
