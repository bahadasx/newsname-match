WASHINGTON, D. 0., June 24.
— Following a conference with
the president, War Secretary
Baker Bald today that he would
be obliged to await further word
from Gen. Pershing before deter
mining his course of action.
"ITntil we get this report, we
absolutely will not consider a
change of policy," he said, "but
the public will not have to wait
five minutes for the report when
It is received.
"The only report thus far, ex
cepting Mexican statements, Is
that of a few stragglers. Ap
parently when the firing began.
the horses stampeded, and these
stragglers were not near where
the shooting began."

Captain Moray may determine
whether war will be declared. He
was second in command at Oarri

though wounded. Gen. Pershing
is awaiting his report of Boyd's
parley with Gomez before the bat
tle started.
Although unofficial, It Is Indi
cated that 84 officers and men
were either killed or captured en
route back to camp. It is feared
the American column was practi
cally annihilated.
Lem Splllsbury, a Mormon
guide with the Americans, said
he saw two officers and 12 troop

ORPET WALL
TAKE STAND
WAVKEGAN, 111., June 24. —
it is likely Will Orpet will take
the stand in his own defense next
Tuesday. Judge Donnelly this
afternoon overuled a motion lo
dismiss llie Orpet jury, and or
dered the defense lo proceed with
it case when court resumes Monl
day.
"At first I giggled because I
thought life was nothing but a
joke and felt no responsibility.
But lately it has been because 1
really wasn't happy, so I tried to
dilgulaa my feeling that way."
Thes words of Marian Lambert,
i in a letter to her Sunday School
i teacher the day before her death,
j were presented to the jury at the
•windup of the prosecution's case
against Will H. Orpet, the young
university student charged with
murdering the girl.
Thanks Him Warmly.
Tho letter said:
"Your note came yesterday and
1 want to thank you more .sincere
ly than you can iinasine for it. I
am very glad that you think tlier'.
Is a possibility of my "amounting
to much' after all. I was very
much afraid that you thought that
I was silly on account of what Is
termed my giggles.
"You may think it queer for one
to laugh when they really want
to cry, but 1 am rather Queer any
way. But now 1 feel much better
and I sincerely want to be some
one that will do a little good any
way. 1 have tried that W. G. C.
(Westminster Guild Club) plan. I
feel that it is succeeding fairly
well. It helps me in many other
things too. * * * I thank you
once more for your good wishes.
With love —Marian."
"P. S. — 1 just learned about \V.
O. C. meeting next Saturday to
day. 1 will be there and try to
bring some of the ones that don't
come very often, If possible."
Mayor Testifies.
Other Important testimony was
that of Mayor Lewis of Lake For
est, the home of Orpet and Mar-
Kress will declare specifically
that under no conditions will the
United States seek territorial
profit by an Invasion of Mexico.
The resolution will probably
state that the only object of in
vasion is the restoration of peace
in .Mexico, and the elimination of
the menace resulting from the
present banditry.
It will also slate that upon the
restoration of peace the United
States will withdraw its forces,
and will not alter the present
boundary line.
This enunciation of Wilson's
purpose is certain to precipitate
a fight in congress. Republican
leaders are preparing to block any
resolution which might tie
Hughes' hands If he Is elected.
An attempt to pay the militia
men $H0 a month failed today,
after a bitter debate. It was
charged the increase in pay would
make the men mercenaries.

Senator Reed presented the
resolution. Gore declared It was
a reflection on the militia and
was capitalizing their patriotism.
Reed bitterly assailed the Oltla
homan.
Government support for fami

border was eliminated today from
the Hay resolution by a senate
committee.
A provision excusing married
men and others with dependents
from service was coustituted.

ian. He declared Orpet had told'
him after his arrest that Marian
had threatened to commit suicide
because of the alleged condition in
which she found herself, and that
this was the reason for his visit
to Lake Forest.
Judge Donnelly was expected
today to deny the motion of the
defense to take the case from the
jury and dismiss Orpet. Orpet is
expected to take the stand in his
own defense.
The defense claimed the state
has failetl to show Orpet purchas
ed any poison, or that the stains
on Marian's coat were made by
liquid poison.
The best thing that has hap
pened for William Orpet since the
beginning of his trial was when
Judge Donnelly barred from the
eyes of the jurors the letters he
wrote to Marian Lambert, which
were found in her desk alter her
death.
Some of these letters, .showing
his pursuit of the girl, have
been printed.
Blow to Father.
But there were othor letters,
written after weak little Marian
had yielded to him, that were full
of a crude and brutal _.«'iisuality
that dishonored even more the
girl who received and treasured
them than it did the boy who
wrote them.
While these terrible letters
were being read poor Mr. Lam
bert bent over the table and cov
ered his face with his iiands. Ilia
shoulders shook with suppressepl
sobs as he mourned his 111110
daughter, who died twice to him,
for she died no less to iilm on
that dreadful day on which he
found false his fond Ideal of her
as a little Innocent, ignorant caild
than she did on the day ii which
her body perished la Helms
woods.
Without doubt the killing of
his belief in her was the crueler
blow of the two.

PLAN FOR

Greater Tacoma!
A Tacoma that should in

Ptiyallup and Sumner, the
hills east and north of the
titlcflats. Brown mid Dash
Points, Dumas Hay and Pic
nic Cove and all the rich ter
ritory between those points
and the present city!
Such was the picture
sketched at a meeting of
beach, hill and valley folk
held last night at Fife school
house, on tli<- inn iin linn
line, and such was the K<*al
toward which a permanent
organization there formed
determined to devote Its en
ergies.
The gathering met at the call
of Fran., 0. Boss, who .time to
Tacoma ;i7 years ago and who
knows every gulch and knoll in
all this section.
Boss not only itnows the
ground, but he has devoted years
of thought and years of lireaming
to the potentialities. He has been
peering into the future.
Ills work as a seer he summed
vi) last night In a paper that re
quired li minutes for "he read
ing and in an immense wall map
of the country on which he had
traced out a network of blue
lines.
I*resents Comprehensive Plan.
These lines represented a com
prehensive plan of high ..ay de
velopment for the north _ stern
side of the country.
IT WAS AN AMBITIOUS
PLAN, THAT WILL REQUIRE
YEARS FOB THK CONSUMMA
TION.
Boss did not present it with
the thought that the roads would
be built this week, or this year,
or next.
He reasoned that now much of
the country Is a wilderness.
But it is a wilderness that is
just on the eve of tremendous
development, due to the diking
and waterway projects that are
coming to completion.
Now the Crucial Time..
Tideflats that have been under
water soon are to bo ready for
the use of ti'.vir, manufacturer and
shipper.
Homes are going to be built to
care for the men in these new in
dustries.
This means there will be new
platting of lands.
While the country Is a partial
wilderness there is still a chance
to lay out the great trunk high
ways just exactly wh?re they
ought to run and to lay Miem out
broad and at the best of all pos
sible grades. A little lelay and
land promoters' greed bring a
repetiton of botched city plats.
The Immediate end of Mr. Ross
is to obtain the acceptance by the
county commissioners of his com
prehensive scheme or some modi
fication of it, so that all future
plats must conform. Thus the
Greater Tacoma of the future
shall be Insured of its heritage.
Actual ! construction of the
roads, of course, would follow
only as the demands of the com
munity warranted.
Plans Wide Arteries.
He declared that 100 and 140
--foot boulevards ought to be in
sisted on for the trunk arteries,
and that on the hillsides the
streets might well be cut to 40
feet and made to fit the contours
of the land.
Among the roads for which tits
plan called were a beach highway
from Stone's Landing to Hya.la
park, thence contoured around
the hill to Intersect -vlth 11th
street; an extension of PtiyAllup'a
Meridian street north across the
river to the bluff, and ontoured
along the hill to 11th street; a
widening and extension of W'illipa
avenue on the tideflats, so that
it should run from tidewater 140
feet wide to Fife and near thars

Now the location is desired for one of the Pantages

magnificent structure in Seattle.
Tacoma has readied the point where good buildings
are being "scrapped" to make way for better ones.
Realty men say that is a definite and an advanced mile
stone in a city's development.
The building has had its part in the city's history.
It was in 1891 that President llunison stood In a

street side, and addressed a crowd that jammed the
street beyond the sound of bis voice,

after the crash.

from the top down. The partitions and floors are pour

and the roof is gone. Part of Hie street has been fenced
off around the building, to prevent accident.
