San Antonio, June 24. Complete
disorganization of the two troops that
wfr fnaged in disastrous coraoai ;
Wednesday moraimr at Carrizal with i
Oarranza troops and the practical an- j
nihilation of those actually in the '
fight was indicated in a report from ;
General Pershing by General Funston
today.
One packer and ei-rht enlisted men
of Troop C. and sewn men of Troop
K. wer picked up yesterday mornirrg ;
by Uieutenint Meyer near Santa Maria, j
All were horse-holders. The stories ;
these lr.en told were almost identical j
to those told by the other stragglers
that reached the transmission lines j
yesterday. ....
No Word rVom Relief Troops.
General Pershing, in his report to- j
day. referred to the number of those J
who previously had returnd -to the
American lines as eleven, although in j
previous dispatches he fixed the num- j
ber at seven. With those who were !
rescued by Lieutnant Meyer the total
number of those who had returned
wau twenty-seven. The- total number
of men in the two troops was learned ;
today to have been eighty-four. Gen- :
eral Pershing, offering a summary of
his information and explaining that
his conclusions were based on such in-
formation as he had secured from the'
Htragglprs and from press reports, !
called attention to the indications that
there were fifty-seven missing and
that press reports indicated fourteen ;
of these were dead and forty-three ;
wre prisoners. General Pershing does
not account in his report for the num
ber wounded, but appeared to assume ;
that all those wounded had been cap-
tured. i
Gererjl Pershing reported that he i
mander of the two squadrons of the
Klcventh cavalry that had been sent
forward to rescue the remnant of the
Tenth. All those brought in by Lieu
tenant Meyer were horse holders and
like those who came intc camp yes
terdav were not ac.tua.Ily in the fight.
They had had difficulty, thev said, in
handling the honses when the furious
machine gun and rifle fire began, and ;
retreated before the conclusion of the
engagement
Bring Back Horses. ;
They had cared for such horses as j
thev could round up after they cot be-

when encountered by Lieutenant '
Meyer ln-ing twenty-five. j
I he troopers told their stories be- I
rore iney nad re-entered tne camp
and h id .in opportunity to talk with
those who had preceded them. The
accounts they gave Lieutenant Meyer
and that they afterwards related to
officers at General Pershing's head
quarters were said to have borne out
in au essentia
details those previously
told
Th
ley said they saw Gen. Feiix Go-' iei'ery comPanv had reported, and tnat potemkin had just preceded the Jfler

Mexican troops that had begun clos
ing in on the American force. . Accord
ing to their story the first intimation
anyone had that hostilities were de
termined upon was the outburst of
machine gun fire. They corroborated
the accounts that said it was not until
then that Captain Boyd gave the com
mand for his men to dismount and re
turn the fire. The Mexicans during

Hope to find Injured. j "
Officers at General Funston's head- i of escaping or effectively retreating,
quarters seemed convinced. after i It was recognized as indisputable that
studying General Pershing's latest re-
port that all of the two troons that
would be found now would be wound
ed. An analysis of the figures secured
indicated that the number of woun'ed
must be in excess of those that es
caped injury and that, therefore, the
battered remnant could not have
moved far from the scene of the fight
ing. Admission of these facts increased
their apprehension as to the fate of
the troopers. Their greatest hope to
day was that nothing worse had be
fallen them and that they would be
there when the relief force from the
Eleventh finally got to them.
Although no news, official or other
wise, had been received today that in
dicated the Mexicans had followed up

officers professed keen anxiety to

of the vessel which staggered ahead
for three ship's lengths and then went
down bow foremost in five minutes.

THE HANDS THAT APPLAUD AND THE HANDS THAT CHEER
We Must See That the Men Who Go Away to Fight Do Not Have to Worry About the
Ones They Leave Behind.
This Was the Sentiment so Earnestly and
of the old crowds in the party and the
final wiping out of the third party in
Kansas. Through tonight's meeting,
the state leaders hope to wipe out
factional designation and to provide a
solid party organization for the fight
for tha Republican ticket in both state
and nation. Withdrawal t iiaines of
Progressive candidates for presidential
electors and statements of party lead
ers that a third state ticket would not
be placed in the field, is cause for be
lief among Republican leacer3 that
the conservatives and radicals in the
party will work in harmony.

and Republican voters in their sup
port of Hughes and Fairbanks, the
men behind tonight's meeting hare
also kept in mind a patriotic demon
stration. Large flags will wave to
night from all sections of the big hall.
Above each flag will be the name of
some favorite Kansas soldier who is
active in the National Guard at the
present ' or won recognition in the
Spanish-American war. At a given
signal, electric fans behind the flags
will start the waving of the stars and
stripes. Incidentally, the waving of
th ; flags is expected to start a real
patriotic demonstration among the
men and women in the hall.
The Speakers.
R. R. Brewster of Kansas City a
brother of S. M. Brewster, attorney
general is expected to leave a few
sentiments tonight that will prove val
uable campaign material in the com
ing battle. Brewst
represents the
old crowd in Republican politics just
as Stubbs represents the radical crowd
that went to the third party in the
campaign of four years ago. As a
public speaker Brewster has little
close competition in this territory. He
spoke before the Kansas Iay club
three years ago and was a real factor
in the fisrht to return Kansas to Re
publican rule in 1914.
Both Stubbs and Brewster will point
the way to party harmony In the
campaign, and Governor Capper will
urge peace and charity and organiza
tion among all the faction? that desire
to beat the Democrats. The Knights
and Ladies of Security band will fur
nish music and an effort will be made
to fill the big hall with men and wo
men interested in the amalgamation
of the two parties.
Similar meetings will be held to
night in a number or towns of the
Ftate. In spite of such action. Repub
licans and Progressives from a number
of towns and counties are expected to
come to Topeka for the ratification.
JPSIES ARE HERE
Savages Begin New Series With
Missonrians Today.
One of Two Teams Must Go In
to the Cellar.
Jack Holland and his St. Joe Drum
mers came to town today to begin a
five game battle with the Savages for
the honor of holding the cellar title.
The first engagement was to begin at
the usual hour this afternoon and to
morrow's bill calls for a doubleheader.
The Drummers, like the Savages,
are pretty badly shot to pieces, but
with Jordan able to hobble around in
his old position at first base and Block
able to catch, they hope to get back
into a winning form.
The Hollanders were badly defeated
at Goodland. Kan., Friday, but they
came in with a perfectly good alibi.
"The Goodland people were too good
to us," they said. "They entertained
us in the morning with a rabbit chase
: and ran our players so hard that they
were too tired to play their usual game
i when afternoon came."

at hand that nearly the entire Ameri

soldiers may have been annihilated in
the fight at Carrizal Wednesday grave
fears were exnressed in official circles
today that not even diplomatic rep -
resentations from Mexico City can pre
vent open hostilities between the
United States and Mexico. Up to late
last night only seven survivors of the
Carrizal battle had returned to their
base in General Pershing's column and
they brought no definite word of the
others' fate.
In preparation for early develop
ments of a serious nature, technical
barriers had been removed to allow
national guard units from all over the
country to be disnatched to the bor-
! der as soon as each is ready.

Secretary Baker had issued orders

low President Wilson to draft imme

the United States all national guards
men who subscribed to the new oath.
The "ay resolution containing this
authorization, adopted by the house
yesterday was before th senate to
day with virtual assurance that it
would be approved.
President Wilson still awaited a
final report from General Pershing on
the Carrizal clash, but army officers
said it might be another day or two
before this arrived. General Persh
ing's official report probably will be
based on the accounts either of offi
cers of the troops which encountered
tho Mexicans or of the cavalry squad
ron which has been tent cut in rearch
of the combatants.
Admiral Winslow, commander of
the Pacific fleet, also has been ordere l
to make a full report scon on the Ma

able from American sources seems to
i shew that in both the Mazatlan and
; Carrizal clashes Carranza authorities
precipitated the fighting. At Carrizaj

have been no arrangements made for

The prisoners were assaulted by

According to a statement said to
have been signed by Spilisbury. which
was made public- today by General
Trevino, neither . he nor the negroes
knew which side began the firing
Spillsbury's statement says that C
troops was first to advance ai(aint
the Mexicans. It adds that practically
all of the Americans who lost (heir
lives were killed when they advanced
to a deep ditch in which Mexicajis
were stationed, and when other Mexi
cans getting around to a deep ditch in
their rear, attacked them from the
flank.
In his statement Spillabury ssvys that
he never dreamed m-hen he left Casa
Grander in company with Captain
Boyd that there would be any trouble,
feeling confident that previous friend
ly relations would continue.
Captain Morey and his men joined
them en route and the statement
quotes Spillsbury as saying during the
conference with General Gomez he
was opposed to Captain Boyd's ob
stinacy, arguing that it would be best
to retire until General Trevino at Chi
huahua had paseed on their request to
Gomez to be allowed to pass. Gomes
explained, it i7 said, that an answer
would come in three hours.
Scout Ffeared Troubles
I mem recount a supposed
.opinion by Spillsbury that Captain
Boyd was imbued with the idea, that
an action would brine him m.irk .
road. It then gives Spillsbury's story
as follows:
"The troops were about 20 yards
apart during the conference. Cap
tains Boyd and Morey and I advanced
half way to meet General Gomex. !?
was twenty minutes after we had re
turned to our respective lines and
Boyd had given numerous orders to
his men and those of Captain Morey.
who were stationed some distance
away, in line, before Boyd gave the
order to advance.
"The opposine sides nr( within
150 yards of each other when the fir
ing began. Neither the negroes nor
I knew who fired first. I remained
behind. Trrop C cot i far as a deep
ditch, where the Mexicans were
placed. Practicallv all who iot therr
lives were there, including Boyd and
Adair. The Mexicans did heavy exe
cution with a machine gun and then,
fretting around to a deep ditch in the
rear, attacked the Americans from
i thaf point.
Troop Entirely Surrounded.
"The whole of Troop C was sur
rounded and not manv seemed to ret
av.'-ay. The horse holders bolted with
a few of the mounts, but the remain
der were bottled up and cafured.
There were two American pack mules
along but they evidently rot away at
Ihe very start. H troop apparent!
fared better as it was firther away.
"A bullet took off my hat and an
other Krazd my arm. One of the ne
groes who was captured is wounded.
"In jail here the negroes are very
bitter about being led into what they
call a dead fall. They mere entirely
in the open with natural defenses ail
around them, such as brush and
ditches, which the Mexicans naturally
took advantage of.
"The Mexk-ans engaged were about
250 in number."
The statement concludes rrr credit
ing Spillsbury with saying that in the
first conference he told Lieutenant
Colonel Rivas that if he personaTrr
were able to get word to General
