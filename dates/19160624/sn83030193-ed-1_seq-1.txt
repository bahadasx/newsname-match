(Special 8taff Correipondint ef Tha Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, June 24. President Wilson summoned Secretary
Lansing and Secretary Baker to his study in the White House this morn
ing and for an hour there was a council of war over the Mexican situa
tion. At the close official announcement was made that the Government
Is still waiting for news from Gen. Pershing to clear up the confused
reports of the Carrizal massacre.
Until delinlto and complete report la mado by tho commanding officer In
the flold thcro will bo no change ol tho Administration policy and no
aggressive action.
' A demand for tha release of the
colored troopors captured In tho Car
rlial battlo Is on Its way to Carranza.
Whether It was glvon Ambaasador

Consul Kodgcrs, thenco to bo glvon
Carranza or whethor It wm jnado di

LITTLE HOPE THAT ANY E9
CAPED ALIVE.
In army circles there la llttlo hope
now that any of Capt. Uoyd's com
mand escaped nllvo, savo tho aavon
travelers who have reached camp
and the aoventeen men taken prls
onera. This would make only twonty
four aurvlvors out of approximately
120 men.
Secretary Haker said he did not
know the exact number of men In the
two troops, but If they wcro of regu
lar elzo the total would be 120 men.
Tho escape of sovoi stragglers was
explalnod by tho eccrntary as being
due to tho fact that wcro well behind
tha. main body, detailed to hold tho
noraoa of their comrades and when
the shooting hogaa they mado off
as fast aa possible. liecause of the
! , fact they know neither tho oventa be
fore the fight nor remained for the
finish, It was decided by tho Presi
dent and his advisors this morning to
alt tight on tho lid for a whllo longer.
It will roqutro nearly n week. It Is
undoratood, to complete tho mobiliza
tion of tho National Guard on tho
border, to make posslbto a movement
In forco beyond tho line. The bordor
patrol must bo maintained and
strengthened evon If occupation of
Northern Mexico la undertaken.
American lives and property would
be In danger otherwise, and the first
purpose of any action wilt bo to safe,

Gore Charges Reed's Move to
Raise Salary, Reflects on
Patriotism of Troops.
WASHINGTON, Juno 24,-An at
tempt Immediately to pay tho Na
tional Guardsmen sent to tho Mexican
front $30 a month failed to-day.
Senator Gore of Oklahoma Inter
poaod an objoctlon which prevontod
Immediate disposal of a bill carrying
tho extra pay, Introduced by Senator
Reod of Missouri.
Senator Goro said Senator Heed's
move was an Insult to tho American
Ism of tho guardsmen, and an Impu
tation on tholr patriotic motives.
Reed walked over near Goro's dosk
and angrily shouted his opinion that
"It 111 becomes a Senator to alt be
hind a mahogany dusk at $7,500 a
year and sneer at these mon who will
fight their country's battles."
"Huch favoritism novcr boforo was
heard of," shouted Gore. That
amount never was paid Civil War
votorans. yot they fought In a real
wur, nnd not against half-clad, hnlf
nnned savages. This is a reflection
on tho patriotism of these- young
heroes. Shall we assume to canl.
tallzu their devotion to thu country?
Winn wo maun them mercenaries?
Shall wo capltallzo patriotism: com
mercl.'illzo devotion to country?"
Heed, red with anr.er. bitterly as
sailed tho blind Oklahoma Senator.
"Capitalize patriotism?" ho asked.
"It's a phniso that comes naturally to
tho lips of a phrase-monger. Hut It
docs not apply truthfully to these
young men who a few days ago bado
farewell to father nnd mother, wlfo
nnd child somo of thc.m for thn lust

"Fifty years after thn Civil War

Total of Over 128,000.
NO MEDICAL TESTS.
None Mustered In, as Com
mands Are Incomplete Gen.
Wood Has No Criticism.
Two outstanding features of unpre
parcdness on thf part of State troops
In what Is known as the Department
of tho Fast became known to-day. One
showed that although President Wil
son's call for the National Guard waa
rent out last Sunday night, not a sin
gle militiaman of tho 128,690 In what
Is known ns tho Department of tho
Fast has beon medically examined.
Tho other reveals that a majority of
the Guard regiments In tho Kastorn
Department nro not even recruited up
to pcacn strength.
Out of tho 128,030 militiamen thero
aro not moro than 18,000 In camps In
tho twenty-two States comprised In
tho Department of tho Fast. Up to
noon to-day not an organization-
meaning a regiment was apparently
ready for mustering Into tho service.
This condition of affairs wni ad
mitted to-day in tho office of Major
Gen. Leonard A. Wood, U. H. A, who
Is head of tho Department of thn Fast
with quarters on Governor's Islard.
Major Gen. Wood wns questioned
about tho state of unprcparedness
among tho militia of tho various
States bordering tho Fastcrn const,
but ho would not utter a word of
criticism of tho National Guard. Tho
Major General Is convinced that all
tho units of tho various States aro
being brought together as quickly na
Is possible under tho circumstances.
Being n professional soldlor nnd tho
mon who nro mobilizing being ama
teurs at tho war game, Gen. Wood
evidently does not bellovo it would
bo In good tasto for him to utter criti
cisms oven whero they might happen
to bo deserved.
Major Ocn. Wood did not go Into
tho reasons for tho fniluro of his
mustering olllcors to mustor In any
of tho regiments of 18,000 national
guardsmen now In tho field. Hut It
Is understood that tho real, serious
reason Is that whllo many companies
may havo had sutllclent men ono or
two would bo found lacking.
Tho perioral mado It plain that
whero thero wero shortages In the
ranks of tho Guardsmen they wore
being filled very rapidly and that
delay was not duo to tho men.
A regular army nlllcer aid to-day
that It was about time tho truth
came out about tho failure of thn Na
tional Guard to bo ready unoner for
entrance to tho t'nlted States service.

SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 24. Complete dis
organization of the troops that were engaged in the
disastrous combat Wednesday morning at Carrizal
with Carranza 's troops, and the practical annihila
tion of those actually in the fight, was indicated in
a report from Gen. Pershing to Gen. Funston to
day. Pershing in his report said that one packer
and eight enlisted men of Troop C and seven en
listed men of Troop K, Tenth Cavalry, were picked
up this morning northwest of Santa Maria.
They were located by Troop M of the Tenth,
under Lieut. Henry Meyer. All of them were in
cluded in the group detailed to care for the horses
at the Carrizal fight, and their stories were sub
stantially the same as those of other stragglers.
They brought back twenty-five horses.
Gen. Pershing referred to the number of those who previously
had returned to the American lines as eleven, although in previous de
spatches he fixed the number at seven. With those who were rescued
by Lieut. Meyer, the total number of those who had returned was twenty-seven.
The total number of men in the two troops was learned to-day to
have been eighty-four. Gen. Pershing called attention u the indications
that there were fifty-seven missing and that press reports indicated four
teen of these were dead and forty-three were prisoners. Gen. Pershing
does not account in his report for the number wounded but appeared to
assume those wounded had been captured.
fOn tho basis of (Icn. Pershing's figures und thosn of tho
.Mexicans It Is more probable that tlilrty-Uvo troopers wero killed.
Of tlio clehty-fnur In tho two commands, twen'y-seven havo re
turned to camp. This leaves flfry-scvon missing. The Mexicans
first reported seventeen prisoners, but to-day mentioned dvo moro,
a total of twenty-mo. Mexican reports told of twelve killed, but It
seems likely that the entire thirty-five, Including ('apt. Murvy, not
captured or who did not return to ramp, wore killed. CJcn.
Trevino, the Mexican commander nt Chihuahua, to-day Intimated
that the whole force hud been annihilated.)
Gen. Pershing reported that he had received no report from the
commander of the two sqiu.lr of the Hleventh Cavalry that has been
sent forward to rescue the remnant of the Tenth.
