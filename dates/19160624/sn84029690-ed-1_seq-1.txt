three till five. A large number was
present and much enjoyed the occasion.
At six o'clock Mrs. Bartholomew enter
tained another party the ladies who!
assisted her, and their husbands, to
gether with several other friends. It
13 not many .women of Mrs. Bartholo
mew's advanced age, who can so suc
cessfully "pull off" two Targe social af
fairs in the same afternoon. Her hos
pitality is much appreciated by the
many who are privileged to partake of
it.
One of the floaters here a supposed
harvest hand went into the Starr res
taurant Wednesday morning and called
for breakfast. After eating a hearty
meal he tried to getaway without pay
ing. The clerk called him down then
the "hobo" told him to come out on
the street and collect, which the said
clerk proceeded to do at once, and
when he got through with the dead
beat, he had evened up in good shape.
He didn't get any cash in the transac
tion, but he did get about four dollars
worth of satisfaction.
Kerns-Moore Nuptials.
' A very pretty wedding was solemn
ized at the home of Mrs. Prudence
Shaw "on Thursday evening, June loth,
when Miss Lily I. Moore, plighted her
troth to Mr.. Albert H. Kerns, Rev. A.
S. Hale of the Methodist church read
ing the words which bound these excel
lent young people together for the re
mainder of their lives. At the auspic
ious moment, Miss Blanche Connelly,
played the wedding march and the bri
dal party came in and took their places
in front of a beautiful floral arch in a
corner of the parlor. Miss.Hazel Moore
and Leo Moore, sister and brother of
the bride, were the only attendants.
The bride wore a beautiful gown of
white crepe meteor trimmed with cas
cade flounces of embroidered silk net,
and looked very lovely indeed. About
forty guests were present. The gifts
were numerous and beautiful. After
greetings and congratulations were
over, the entire party repaired to the
church parlors a few blocks away, and
enjoyed an elaborate wedding supper
prepared by the L. A. S. of the church.
The bride is the oldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Bird Moore, and the
grand-niece of Mrs. Shaw with whom
she has lived since early childhood. She
is a graduate of the Normal School at
this place and has held a responsible
position in the office of the school for
the past two years. The groom, also
one of our Normal boys, is well and
most favorably known here. For the
past two years he has been Superin
tendent of the schools at Ashland, Wis.
He was also principal of schools at
Oakley, Kansas, for one year. He will
take post-graduate work here for the
ensuing year and the new home will be
permanently established in Hays. Many
friends will wish them a long and nappy
life together.

Children's Day at the Methodist

seats being taken and vestibules also
crowded with people standing. Space

gram given, but in ah hour and a half
a hundred or so finely trained children
gave an entire program. A stranger
present said he never saw a lot of Sun
day School children that displayed so
much talent for both speaking parts, or
that had been better trained. The
committee in charge were: Mrs. Hale,
Mrs. Wood and Miss Ethel Robinson.
Miss Robinson surely has a "gift" for
leading choruse.', and the church rarg
with beautiful strains of music under
her leading.

FIRST NATIONAL BANK
HAYS, KANSAS
loosen up and laugh and cry. First
class orchestra. First class play.
First class players. First class audi
ence. A Railroad fleeting.
W. M. Sterrett, agent for the Antho
ny r Northern Railroad, routed from a
point on the Gulf of Mexico to a termi
nal point in Nebraska, now operating as
far north as Larned, Kansas, was here
Thursday, and a meeting was called at
10:30 at the Essex Hall. About 100
of the representative men of the city
and immediate country were present.
The proposition from the railroad j
company is that the people of the town
ships through which the road passes
shall bond the township to the amount
of 52,000 per mile for road purposes and
$5,000 per mile for terminal purposes
making in all $7,000 per mile.
Taking into consideration the high
cost of railroad building material it is
thought that this amount was extreme
ly reasonable. In as much as the price
of spikes have advanced in price from
$1.40 to $3.00 per keg, and the advance
on rails and other material has ad
vanced proportionately $7,000 per mile
does not look unreasonable. Mr. Ster
rett asked also $20,C00 for terminals
from Hays City, which seemed to be
satisfactory to the citizens who were
in attendance. The bonds are to run
thirty years at five per cent interest,
with the provision that the company
can take the bonds at any time after
ten years.
The meeting adjourned to meet at
8:00 the same evening, at which a com
mittee was appointed to meet President
Boycecf the road at LaCross this Friday
afternoon. The following were the
committee: H. W. Oshant, Henry
Sch waller, Paul Dinges, P. J. Deane
and Dr. Hennerich.
This road, if the people will do their
part will certainly be built and within
the year. The county and the city of
of Hays, the Fort Hays Normal and
the Experiment Station need this road
badly. Let us all pull together and j
make this road possible. It will mean a
great and lasting good for all concerned.
