HORSEMEN ATTACK FLANK,
MACHINE GUN IN FRONT
No Chance Given to Escape ? Captain
Morey Dead or a Prisoner,
Is Belief.
San Antonio. Tex., June 23.?The two troops of the 10th
Cavalry under Captain Charles T. Royd practically were wipcd
out by the attack of Mexican forces under General Gomez at
Carrizal June 21, according to indications given in a fragment
ary report received by General Funston from General Pershing
to-night.
General Pershing's message stated that seven survivors in
all, including those who arrived last night, have reached the
main column. All were enlisted men, but the report did not say
whether there were non-eommissioned officers among them.
According to the stories of the survivors, as outlined in
General Pershing's report, a mounted force of Mexicans made a
charge from the flank at the conclusion of a parley between Cap
tain Boyd and General Gomez. at the same time that a machine
gun opened fire from the front as Geuenf (iomez reached his
lines.
Captain Boyd had ordered his men to dismount as the
machine gun opened fire. The eombined effect of tho Mexican
charge. the machine gun fire and the rifle fire from the .Mexi?
can garrison of Carrizal, which had almost surroun.lod the little
American force under cover of the parley sought by (ieneral
Gomez to discuss whether Captain Boyd should lx> allowed to
pass through the town, .stampeded the horses. No details were
made known to General Pershing as to whether the .Mexican
charge was checked.
CAUGHT BY FIRE FROM THREE SIDES.
With their mounts gone, caught without means of escape,
ringed about on three sides with the ftre of an overwhelming
force, the fate of the little detachment is believed by officers
here to have been sealed. Ii is feared that only the greatest
luck. baeked by desperate valor, could have extricated Captain
Boyd's men from the trap.
Reports from Mexican forces placed the number of killed.
including two officers, at from twelve to forty. It is reported
that seventeen were takpn captive into Chihuahua City.
The accepted percentage of wounded to those killed in mod
ern warfare would place the wounded at from thirty-five to
forty at the lowest estimate. The strength of the two troops,
(i and K. is not known here. but it is estimated that they could
not ext-eed L'50 men, allowing for those sick and on detached ser
vice. With only seven survivors reported as arriving at the
main column, the number of those accounted for, at least specu
latively, is pitifully small.
The report from General Pershing stated that the stories
of the survivors were confused and did not conform in all de?
tails with the report made by the first arrivals fn-m the bat
tlefield.
