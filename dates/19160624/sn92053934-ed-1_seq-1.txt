Bounced today that the French have '
regained a large part of the ground !
lost northeast of Verdun near Hills ;!2fl
and uCl.
Undertaking a vigorous offensive, the
Trench drove back the Germans oer
the ground which they won yesterday, j
The battle was particularly violent in 1
the vicinity of Floury. The French did ;
not succeed in regaining possession of!
Thiaumont work.
More than six German divisions par-
ticinated in the offensive, actions east;
of the Meuse yesterdav. i
Fighting is Furions. j
Late details show that yesterday's!
fighting near Verdun equalled iu fury;
anything yet experienced. The total !
German forces engaged on a two mile I
front are estimated at between four
and five divisions. It w : ; . b the j
last overwhelming rush win n the do- j
fenders were worn nut and thinned bv j
many hours of bombardment that the
enemy succeeded in rushing the Thiau !
mont work and adjacent advanced j
trenches.
The Thiaumont fortification covered I
the approaches to 1'leury and thy j
enemy hoped to continue the charge I
and sweep away the defenders of thej
latter place but the French counted a:-t
tacked with such vigor that it was able j
only to cling to the positions first I
gained. I
The Germans have captured the
Thiaumont work after three weeks of ;
effort hut the French advanced line j
still holds good, possessing the great
er part of Hills :J20 and DIM. These
fresh strokes arc regarded in author
itative quarters with perfect calm,
(.crmans I p to Standard.
Whether true or not that the Ger
mans have been obliged to withdraw
troops from the western front to send
to Russia, recent attacks in the Ver
dun cockpit have been well up to the
standard of intensity. They found effec
tives to deliver a well nourished on
blaught in the Champagne region. Kx
peetations raised by the furious 25
hour bombardment on the right bank
of the Meuse was fulfilled. From early
morning until nightfall attack after
attack was launched along the short
front from Thiaumont to Damloup.
The object is to secure control of the
Yaux ravine without which it is im
possible for them to force back the
French advanced line and begin an
attack upon the mam line of forts be
tween SouviHe and Tavannes. The ra
vine is closc-ly boxed in by the Cail
lette woods to the north and the
Chapitre wood lo the south and Hill
o20, where the French position forms
its root to the west. German attacks
here met with some success but at
heavy cost.
East of the ravine, however, the
enemy made no headway whatever.
Here the French lines which command
the approaches to Souvillc are under
attack.

LATIN-AMERICAS

San Salvador. Republic of Salva
dor. June St. The foreicrn office
received today a cablegram from
the trovernment of Ernador nrsing
all Latin-American governments to
take common action to avert war
between the I nited States and
Mexico. The government replied
immediately approving the initia
tive of Ecuador.
Washington, June 24.-Kliseo Arre
dondo. the .Mexican ambassador-designate
here, was notified today that the
government of Ecuador and Salvador
had tendered their good offices to Gen
eral Carranza to aid in averting war
between the United States and Mexico.
It is understood the dispatch did not
comment on what Carranza's attitude
would be.
News that some of the South and
Central American republics were pre-
paring to initiate offers of mediation m
the cnsi& between the rniteit ""States
and Mexico drew from high officials
here today a strong intimation that
the ("nited States, engaged only in pro
tecting its people and territory, con
sidered there was nothing to mediate,
so far as the policy of this government
was concerned.
Although Ecuador and Salvador have
authorized their ministers to confer
with their colleagues on the subject the
state department does not expect any
immediate overtures from the body of
Latin-American diplomats. It is un
derstood that Ambassador Naon of Ar
gentina, who came here from New
York yesterday seeking information,
telegraphed his government that noth
ing could be done at this time to
ward initiating mediation.
REPORT MEX SPIES
IN AMERICAN CAMP
Columbus, June 24. Investigation
of reports that Mexican spies have
been in the expeditionary base camp
here recently resulted today in the
discharge of several Mexican em
ployes of the army quartermaster's
department. They were ordered by
Captain Louis J. Van Schaack, chief
of- the intelligence department, to
leave Columbus immediately.
A motor truck train, a mile long,
carrying 30,000 pounds of military
necessities, left here today for Gen
eral Pershing's base. Reports from
the field indicate Pershing is draw
ing his command into a shorter and
more compact line.
GERMAN CHANCELLOR
AGAINST ANNEXATION
London, June 24. An Amsterdam
dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
company says the German chancellor.
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, has pub
lished an authorized statement in the
semi-oflicial North German Gazette
that he endorses the speech delivered
at Rreslau June 20 by Philip Scheide
mann, a socialist member of the reich
stag, in which Scheidemann asserted
that the chancellor was opposed to
the annexation of Belgium and to oth
er far-reaching plans for pan-German
expansion.
THE WAR TODAY
The Cermans reached Flenry,
three and one-half miles of Verdun
yesterday but Paris reports that
the French drove them back after
a intent counter attack. The
French admit, however, that the
Germans gained another step in
their progress toward Verdun by
capturing positions northeast of
the fortress,' after stubborn light
ing. The Russian advance into Buko
wina continues, but further north
the Germans under General von
Miisingen are pressing them back
over a front of M miles, according
to Berlin. From holki on the Styr
river, almost to the (.nlician fron

MEXICO CASE
AT BREAKING
POINT, CLAIM
Relations Between United
States and De Facto Gov
ernment Very Grave.
OFFICIALS CONFER
Secretaries Baker and Lans
ing in Secret Meeting at
White House.
Washimrton. June 24. Relations
between the I'nited States and
the de facto government of Jlex.
ico are close to the breaking point
today as a resnlt of the apparent
ly well founded belief that. Amer
ican cavalrymen were deliberate
ly massacred Wednesday at Carri
zal by Carranza soldiers.
Secretaries Lansing and Baker con
ferred early today at the White house
with President Wilson. It is known
that the possibility of drastic retalia
tory action against the Mexican forces
in Chihuahua was given grave consid
eration. If the Carranza government
accepts responsibility for the attack
at Carrizal, it is considered virtually
certain by officials that occupation of
most of northern Mexico will be order
ed by President Wilson, to take place
as rapidly as the necessary military
forces can be placed at the disposal
of General Funston.
Action must await further reports
from General Pershing. His mes
sage last night indicating that only
seven men of the two troops of cav
alry had survived in addition to those
taken prisoner, had not been supple
mented at an early hour.
To Demand Repudiation.
It is believed the first act of the
Washington government, when fuller
information is at hand, will be to de
mand repudiation of the Carrizal at
tack by the Carranza government
Preliminary reports have convinced
officials here that the American troops
were deliberately led into a trap. The
only question remaining to be settled
is whether the Carranza government
ordered the attack or it was the work
of a subordinate officer.
In the latter event, unqualified re
pudiation of his act and immediate
surrender of prisoners probably will
be demanded. General Gomez, Car
ranza commander at Carrizal, was
killed in action, according to Mexican
reports. So if he gave orders to open
fire he has already paid the penalty
for his act.
Fnnston Sends in Report.
General Funston reported to the war
department late today that 11 surviv
ors of the Carrizal fight had returned
to General Pershing's line. Sixteen
were reported to have been picked up
by the cavalry relief column and 17 to
have been captured by the Mexicans,
leaving unaccounted for 40 of the 84
officers and men under Captain Boyd.
A dispatch from General Pershing
transmitted by General Funston sai l
none of the rescued troopers knows
what had been the fate of their com
mander and that their stories were so
vague it was impossible to get a clear
idea of what had happened. The mes
sage referred to several troopers re
turning "by another route," but offi
cials thought it meant some of the Id
picked up by the relief column.
MOBILIZATION OF
GUARD COMPLETE
Springfield, 111., June 24. The
mobilization of the Illinois national
guard was rapidly nearing completion
today, troop trains from Chicago and
down state points arriving almost

day for Governor Dunne. The gov
ernor is in Chicago to attend the wed
ding of his son who also is a member

I'nder the direction of Lieutenant
Colonel E. M. Lewis of the United
States army, assigned to the Illinois
national guard as inspector instructor,
the preliminaries to mustering the
state troops into the federal service
were begun today both at Camp Dunne
land at Camp Lincoln where the cav
alry, artillery, engineers and signal
corps arc quartered.
Colonel Milton J. Foreman of the
First cavalry expected the arrival
here from Chicago today of about 250
new recruits who will be used to re
place those now at Camp Lincoln who
may be eliminated through the medical
examination preceding the mustering
of state troops into the federal service.
Nearlv all the men recruited in Chi-
eago during the last few days, Col
lonel Foreman said, are skilled artis
laiiR who will be highly prized by the
cavalry troops.

REPORT SAYS
GEN.TREVINO
ORDERS HALT
Mexican Commander Sends
Army Forward to Engage
American Forces.
CAVALRYMEN JAILED
Captured Members of the
Tenth Cavalry Thrown
in Chihuahua Prison. . -J
Chihuahua City, M e x.,
June 24 American columns
have been seen advancing
from the American field base
in the direction of San An
tonio and Ojo Caliente, and
General Jacinto Trevino has
issued orders to attack them
if they do not immediately
retreat.
The Mexican commander said to
day that it seemed probable, inas
much as iieneral Pershing seemed
ignorant of the fate of the Boyd
column, that outside of five addi
tional prisoners now being brought
here, the Americans were anni.
hilated, although it was possible
more had escaped.
General Pershinsr has wired here
for the names of the dead and the
prisoners.
It was officially announced to
day that none of the prisoners
brought here will be hanged that
"not being the custom in a civil
ized country."
The 17 American negroes cap
tured in the Carrizal battle have
been placed in the peuileutiary ...
here. There have been no arrange
ments made for removing them to
Juarez to be surrendered to the
American authorities.
Lem Spillsbury, the Mormon scout.,
captured at Carrizal, also is in prison.
The prisoners were assaulted by Mex
ican civilians as they were being trans
ferred from the train to the peniten
tiary but were landed safely behind the
walls of the building, and according to
the authorities, are being well treated.
The troopers brought here are Pri
vates Page, Peterson, N. Lloyd, W.
Ward, Jones, Sockes, Marshall, Oliver,
M. Donald, Williams, Givens, Stone,
Harris, Lee and Graham of Troop H
and Hove and Alexander of Troop C.
Do Not Know Who Opened Fire.
According to a statement said to have
been signed by Spillsbury, which was
made public today by General Trevino,
neither he nor the negroes knew which
side began the firing.
Spillsbury's statement says that
Troop C was first to advance against
the Mexicans. It adds that practically
all the Americans who lost their lives
were killed when they advanced to a
deep ditch in which Mexicans were
stationed and when other Mexicans,
getting around to a deep ditch in their
rear, attacked them from the flank.
General Trevino said the Americans
would get the same treatment that they
received at Carrizal as he is deter
mined to carry out his orders to the
letter.
In this, he said, he had all his sub
ordinates with him and they will stick
with him in case of a rupture.
Puts Blame on Boyd.
In his statement Spillsbury says he
never dreamed when he left Casas
Grandes in company with Captain
Boyd that there would be any trou
ble, feeling confident that previous
friendly relations would continue.
Captain Morey and his men joined
them enroute, and the statement
quotes Spillsbury as saying, during
the conference with General Gomez,
he was opposed to Captain Boyd's
"obstinacy," arguing that it would be
best to retire until General Trevino
at Chihuahua had passed on their re
quest to Gomez to be allowed to pass.
Gomez explained, it is said, that an
answer would come in three hours.
The statement recounts a supposed
opinion by Spillsbury that Captain.
Boyd was imbued with the idea that
an action would bring him quick pro
motion, and also that the Mexlcaus
would back down on a show of force.
It credits the scout with having ar
gued with Lieutenant Adair on the ev
ening before against moving into the
Carrizal territory in search of ban
dits and also says he admits having
importuned Captain Boyd at least to
try to get around by some other road.
It then gives Spillsbury's story as
follows:
Spillsbury's Story.
"The troops were about 200 yards,
apart during the conference. Cap
tains Boyd and Morcy and I advanced
half way to meet General Gomez. H
was 20 minutes after we had returned
to our respective lines and Boyd had
given numerous orders to his men and
those of Captain Morey, who wera
stationed some distance away, in line,
before Boyd gave the order to ad
