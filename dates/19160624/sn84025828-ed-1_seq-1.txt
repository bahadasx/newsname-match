Governor Edward F. Dunno will bo
renominated by tbo Democrats. In an
address to the public Just Issued, the
Governor says:
"During tha Forty-eighth general as
sembly, notwithstanding the fact that
the Democratic members of both
houseB were In a minority, I had the
satisfaction of seeing twelve of tho
eighteen measures recommended by
mo placed upon the statute books,"
the Governor declared.
Following Is the list of twelve meas
ures which the Governor says wero
placed on the statute books during his
administration:
Ratification of amendment to Fed
eral constitution providing for election
of United States Senators by direct
voto of the people.
Tho Public Utilities Commission
law.
The law empowering all cities In tho
Stato to own and operato public utili
ties. The law authorizing employment of
convicts on roads.
Tho law establishing an epileptic
colony.
Tho law providing for rotation of
names of candidates for stato offlces
on ballots.
The law creating tho legislative ref
erence bureau.
The law creating efficiency and econ
omy committee.
Tho law amending tho 2-cent rail
way faro act so as to make it apply to
children.
The law creating a state highway
commission and providing for the
building of good roads.
The law compelling corporations to
pay wages semi-monthly.
The law consolidating tho fish and
gama commissions and reforming tho
abuses of the old separate commis
sions. "In addition to tho above," the state
ment adds, "I took pleasure in further
ing the passage of and signing the bill
known as the workmen's compensa
tion act, which rovUed the law of 1911,
and which provides, without litigation,
compensation to Injured employes for
injuries sustained in tho courso of
their employment.
"Likewise during my administration
tho Forty-eighth genoral assembly
passed coal mining laws providing for
greater safoty in mining operations
and the establishment of rescue sta
tions. It also passed the electric head
light bill and other remedial legisla
tion." Stato's Attorney Maclay Hoyne Is
out with a statement announcing his
candidacy for re-election. His plat
form is to be, he assorts, the record of
his achievements during the last four
years, and on this record ho askB the
voters to assist him. His statement
follows:
''I'have decided to be a candidate
for re-election as state's attorney, and
to that end shall seek a renomlnatlon
from the Democratic party at the
September primary.

Interesting Character from the
from the advice and assurances of
support I havo received from over
1,000 citizens of different political par
ties, who aro leaders In business, la
bor, professional and civic affairs.
They inform me they wilt soon elect
officers and organlzo for an energetic
campaign.
"I regret that the existing election
laws make It necessary for candidates
for State's Attornoy and other muni
cipal offices to seek a partisan nomin
ation. National politics and policies,
and politics generally, should have not
tho slightest connection with the of
fice of State's Attornoy and such of
flces. Slnco tho election in 1012 I
havo conducted tho Stato's Attorney's
office on this theory. Upon tho rec
ord made during this period I stand.
"I ask tho aid and votes of tho vot
ers of tho Democratic party at tho
September primary upon that record,
regardless of their previous factional
connections, sympathies or activities.
"My determination to bo a candi
date is nnd will remain, unaffected by
the action, desires or wishes of any In
dividual, or group of individuals, as
suming to givo orders to the mass of
the party voters of this county or to
myself.
"I feel It' necessary to say this be
cause of silly newspaper articles to
the effect that certain Democratic
leaders were organizing a local 'Tam
many,' and that candidates for party
nominations In this county would be
compelled by a pledge to turn over the
power of appointment and other
patronage of the offices they sought to
some commltteo or group of leaders.,
"I never have nor will I over sign,
give or mako such a pledge, or any
pledge whatever othor than that I
make In publlo to the voters of Cook
County. I disclaim any Intention or
deBlre, singly or Jointly, to Tammany
Izo any official or private citizen, and
I know that I will permit no one to
familiarize mo or any offico I ever
hold or hopo to hold."
"I recognize," ho said, "under the
existing electlcm laws, the legality and
propriety of each political party choos
ing a county central commltteo, and
that committoes have certain powers
and duties to perform.
"Although tho nomination of candi
dates for State's Attorney and county
officers generally Is not ono of the
functions of tho county central com
mltteo, and although Its indorsement
or failuro to Indorse binds neither the
voters of the party nor tho candidate,
I realize tho county central commit
too, through Its reorganization, can
givo greatest old to a candidate for
nomination.
"Having this in mind, and subject to
what has been said above, I shall seek
the aid and Indorsement of my candi
dacy for nomination from the present
duly elected county central committee
of tho Democratic party, and hope,
upon my record In office, I may receive
it.
"I have referred to my record In of
fice, so in conclusion let me say that
this record 1b not one of drastic, harsh
and relentless prosecutions. No pub
lic' official or private citizen, minister,
priest or rabbi ever asked leniency or
mercy for the young, Ignorant, poor
or misguided first offender in vain. It
Is to the habitual criminal and be
trayer of public trust alone that a deaf
ear has been turned."
The Chicago Dally News of June 13,
1916, in the course of on able editorial
Men
in
headed "Preparing for a Hard Con
test," said:
"Tho chances of Wilson or Hughes
In any state may bo materially aided
or Injured by the charactor of tho
men nominated .for stato and local
offices. This is no timo to load down
either party ticket with nominees who
will be a source of weakness to It.
In short, the nomination of two strong
national tickets should servo to put
the two parties on their mettle, lead
ing them to select their best men for
Governor
the thousands of minor offices to be
filled in November."
The principal charge brought
against two of the Democratic county
officials whose terms expire next fall
is that they are swell headed.
This is a bad year for swell heads.
Party workers may be Induced
against their will to renominate them.
But the voters will not re-elect
them.
THE PUBLIC BE D-D
This Motto of Some Public Of
ficials is Gradually Waking the
People Up.
The overbearing insolence of somo
of the office holders In the City Hall
and County Building calls attention to
the fact that an Office Holding Aris
tocracy Is rapidly growing into perma
nent control of our public affairs.
Among our officials there nro somo
honorablo exceptions somo men who
feel that they aro in offico to servo
the people.
But there aro others and their
number Is Increasing who imagine
that the only thing tho avcrngo citizen
is good for Is to voto.
Party allegiance Is forgotten when
they aro sworn In and tho Jobs go
to relatives, regardless of party or fit
ness. Tho Offico Holding Aristocracy has
no use for tho voter after he has used
him.
Herbert Knufman paid his respects
to these follows when ho called atten
tion to their treatment of tho public
In theso words:
"You consider yourself ah Important
person becauso your position occasion
ally permits you to annoy people. But
so can a gnat, a rusty hinge, n rattling
window and other minor bothers.
."Impudence Is a Smart-atock's con
ception of Impresslvcness a back
stairs notion of 'big folks" behavior.
An upsturt betrays himself by the
manner he displays his authority.
"Thoso who aren't accustomed to
tho ubo of power Invariably abuse It.
"Insolence Is tho snarl of tho insig
nificant 'big head' evidence of a
small ono.
"You merely show up when you
show off. Wo all know Just nbout
what your Job pays and therefore how
much Intelligence It demands so why
bluff?
"Offico boys, boll hops and cash
girls may possibly mlstako your Im
pertinence as a manifestation of su
periority, but the public recognizes
the ass In the 111 fitting lion's skin.
"Headquarters nlways hears tho.
creak In the machine hnd soon locates
tbo source of tho trouble."
The voters of Chicago may bo fools
somo of tho time; thoy may be so
supine part of tho time that theso Pub
lic Office Aristocrats look upon them
as serfs.
EDWARD F. DUNNE,
of Illinois and Candidate for Re-election.
But tho voters of Chicago aro not
going to bo fools all of the time.
And when they wake up, some of
these swell heads will hear from them.
Tho terms of some of tho Offico
Holding Aristocrats expire next fall.
The Democratic party can make a hit
by refusing to renominate them.
It the party does renominate them
the people will make a hit that will
force some of theso stiffs to tako a
run home and stay thore.
CONNIRY A KING?

criticize tho official action of Recorder
Joseph F. Conncry In the mutter of his
booming the Torrens System, friends
of that high-blooded official aro al
leged to havo threatened to have this
paper excluded from the malls.
Friends of tho Royal Family havo
mado statements to that effect.
Slnco when did criticism of tho acts
of public officials becomo an Illegal act
in this country?
Tho press is supposed to bo free.
Publlo officials are supposed to bo
the servants of tho people.
Perhaps Connery is an exception.
The Chicago Eagle believes in com
petition in the abstract Hold as well
as In every other field.
For that reason it is opposed to
Government monopoly of any lino of
business, whether that monopoly la
owned by the National, State, County
or City Governments.
Tho Torrens system of abstract mak
ing, which is a fad imported from
a Public and Political
State and All Parties
England, now costs CO per cent of tho
old and reliable abstracts which peo
ple now use.
When It becomes a government mo
nopoly it will cost the pcoplo moro di
rectly than tho old abstracts .because
of tho tendency to raise all public fees
after they aro once saddled on the pco
plo by law.
Its adoption by tho pcoplo gener
ally, which is not at all likely, no mat
ter how much taxpayers' money may
bo blown In on advertising tho fad,
would result In Increasing the county
payrolls.
The Democratic party cannot afford
to stand for this Torrens Fad for theso
and othor reasons of vital Importance
to It.
A register of the leading and vet
eran abstract makers employed by
private capital In making abstracts In
Chicago, discloses tho names of many
lifelong Domocrats and highly respect
ed citizens of Chicago who havo de
voted their political activities to pro
moting tho Interests of tho Demo
cratic party.
Among thoso sterling Domocratla
abstract makers wo noto tho
Nearys,
Shortalls,
O'Connors,
McGIUens,
Jonesos,
Murphys,
Grahams,
Whltty's
Rlleys,
O'Mearas,

Nicholsons,
And othors, every ono of whom havo
rendered a life tlmo of Democratic
service.

not only tho Recorder's offico, but
most nil of tho othor offlcos in tho
County Building.
"Modern Evolution," as tho Tor
roiis Faddists .call It, may bo all right,
but Government should not bo used
to put honest trades and occupations
out of existence
Thoro Is an ample flold in Chicago
for both Outsiders and Recorders.
A monopoly In Government hands
Is oven moro dangorous than a
monopoly in private hands.
THE CONNERY BUILDING
Proposed New Name for the
Court House in Honor of the
Distinguished Family of Office
Holders.
How would tho people voto on the
proposition to change tho namo of tho
Court House to the Connery Building?
Many of tho enthusiastic friends of
tho family would hall tho change with
delight.
It would not be inappropriate, Judg

Four years ago, in 1012, tho fllos ot
Tho Eagle Bhow that:
-Joseph F. Connery was a candldato

His brother, Francis D. Connory, was

It would describe It better than tho
time-worn namo of Court House.
WILL CONNERY

Booming the Torrens Fad and

that He Didn't Ask County to
