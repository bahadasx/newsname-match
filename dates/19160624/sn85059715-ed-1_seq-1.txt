nf the American force which engaged
the Mexican* at Carrixitl have return

Captain* Hoyil and Morey, Lieutenant
Adair and forty troopers, according
to a report brought here today by arrival*
from the Inferior.
The three officer* are talleved i
dead. According to till* report tlie
total of American dead in the tattle
probably una twenty-six, unles* *onie

SAN ANTONIO. June 24.--In the'
shadow of the Alamo, where the
death." of Davy Crockett. James Rowio.
Colonel Travis and Colonel Bonham
made history seventy years ago,
citizens of San Antonio today were
convinced that another Alamo had
been fought last Wednesday ut Carrizal
by Captain Charles L. Boyd's
troopers of the Tenth cavalry and
that the names of Captains Boyd and
Morey and Lieutenant Adair would
go down into history with those of
their illustrious predecessors.
r, t un..<l? - ,li..;ulnn hn?.l '
quarters, however, still hop** that a
complete and ofllclal roport from General
Pershing would show that more
than seven men. who have reached
the main column, have escaped death,
wounds or capture.
Yet none despite that the fragmentary
report shows that the plight of
the little band of Americans must
have been desperate. According to
those reports they were lured to their
death by the pretense of a parley.
The Americans were nearly eighty
miles from the nearest chance of aid.
surrounded by a tremendously superior
force. While endeavoring to
avoid a clash, they were swept by
machine gun and rifle fire.
The fragmentary report showing
that Captain Hoyd hoped to avoid a
clash gave no Indication that the
American troopers occupied ground
which could be readily defended
when the battle opened or that it
would afford protection from the raking
cross fire to which they were subjected.
Unless Captain Floyd succeeded In
checking the Mexican charge and
withdrawing his men to more advantageous
position, tho stories on which
General Pershlngs report have boon
based would seem to indirato that the
Amoxican troops were forced to take
what shelter they could from the
cacti and sand dunes of an open plain
and fighting It out as did Custer's
men at the battle of the Kittle Big
Iforn.
No further news from General
Pershing arrived at General PunsIon's
headquarters early today, and
what befell the two squadrons of the
Eleventh cavalry sent as a relief expedition
to rescue the remnants of!
Captain Boyd's command Rtlll Is un-l
known. No fear was felt, however,
for the safety of this force since It
Is believed the expedition was strong
enough to deal with any situation,
which it might meet.
Colonel James Lockett is in command
of the Eleventh cavalry with
Henry T. Allen as lieutenant colonel.
Command of the expedition may have

State troops will begin movement
toward the border within the next
few days. General Funston has made
his plans for the disposal of the national
pnard mustered Into the service
of the government. Their destinations
have not been announced for
reasons of military expediency.
Complete disorganization of the
r two troops that were engaged in disastrous
combat at Carrizal with Carranza
troops and the practical annU
hllation of those actually in the
fight was Indicated in a report from
General Pershing to General Funston
today.
One packer and eight enlisted men
of C troop and seven men of K troop;
were picked up Friday morning by
Lieutenant Meyer near Aanta Maria.
All were horseholders. The stories'
these men told were almost identical
to those told by the other stragglers
that ran o host th? t t-n nnmlninn lino

CHARLESTON, June 24?Dlwawa
will be fought in West Virginia by (
means of large posters of which thousands
will be distributed over the
state by the state health department.
These posters will be sent principally
to the postofllces and general
stores In the little towns, thereby
reaching the rural population of the
state. A large proportion of the pre
ventnoie diseases are known to be
rural. This Is especially true with
consumption, trachoma ami typhoid.
The first placard to be distributed
will be upon tuberculosis, and con-!
tains the following aphorisms:
Consumption can be prevented. It
Is not Inherited.
It is spread by the cough or spit
of the consumptive.
Open bedroom windows help to '
prevent or to cure It. 1
Fresh air. good food, sunshine and
rest cure it.
The use of drinking cups and towels
after being used by others is dangerous.
The consumptive should sleep in a
room alone.
Don't spit on the floor or sidewalk.
The cough which persists should
be referred to your doctor.
Patent medicines and alcohol make
the consumptive worse.
Be sure all cases of consumption
arc reported to the health officer, as
thla will help gave Uvea,
ahe la a attest.
