Columbia, June 20.?The State
mobilisation camp at Styx, seven
miles from Columbia In Lexington
county, has already been staked out
for the encampment of ono regi?
ment of Infantry. Arrangements for
the encampment of another regiment
and a troop of cavalry were made
yesterday afternoon by MaJ. P. J.
Drew, quartermaster, and an engineer.
The first troops are expected at Styx
early Friday.
A regiment in camp will occupy a
space of 280 yards frontage and 345
yards depth. The tents for the en?
listed men are pitched In 14 rows, 12
of them being for the Infantry com?
panies comprising the regiments, one
for the headquarters' company, and
sanitary troop and one row for the
supply and machine gun company. A
row of tents and the streets on which
they face take up 60 feet.
The tents for officers are arranged in
away from the enlisted men. Sleeping
quarters and mess tents for the offi?
cers are placed in rows.
Latrines, stables, eupply tents and
quarters for the stable guards are
placed far In the rear of the tents for
the enlisted men.
The camp site comprises 1,007 acres
oh a sandy ridge, with good drainage
facllttes. Water mains have already
been laid for one regiment of Infan?
try and yesterday plans were made for
laying water mains for another regi?
ment and for a troop of cavalry.
Convicts from the State penitentiary
will very probably be used for im?
proving the road between the railway
station and the Styx camp ground. The
matter was discussed yesterday at a
conference between Gov. Manning and
D. J. Griffin superintendent of the
penitentiary. The attorney general
will very probably be asked to give an
opinion as to the right of using tho
prisoners. *
The Southern Railway company was
yesterday asked by the adjutant gen?
eral's office to make the following
improvements at Styx: Platform and
additional passenger station facilities,

j Columbia, June 21.?The encamp?
ment at Styx is being prepared |o^re
!celve the First regiment on Friday
1 and the Second regiment on Saturday.
The Charleston Light Dragoons will
reach camp Saturday.
The attention of the military de?
partment of the State was turned yes?
terday toward bettering tho conditions
at Styx, where the camping grounds
for one regiment have already been
laid out and where the grounds was
being cleared for the quarters of) the
Second regiment.
Arrangements were made yesterday
with local railroad officials at a con?
ference In the office of the adjutant
general to have a freight station built
at Styx, with a 100 foot platform and
a depot 60 by 30 feet. A spur track
for the handling of freight, cars will
also be laid as soon as possible.
Today, under the supervision of
Capt. George Warren of the. Quarter?
master corps, in charge of tho trans?
portation, instruction and repair de?
partments, a 25 foot roadway Will be
built from the site of the freight depot
to the camping grounds, about three
quarters of a mile away. The . new
road will follow approximately the
line of the present road, which will
be rolled and put into shape lor the
transportation of materials < from the
depot to the camp. The road will not
require much grading as the suaface
slope along the way is only gradual.
Capt. Warren and Capt* Cantey of
the machine gun company were at
Styx yesterday morning, the former
making arrangements for the roadway
which will pass through property
owned by N. H. Driggers of Columbia,
and '.he latter assisting in laying out
the regimental headquarters,
The camp site for the First regi?
ment faces obliquely oa the 600 yard
rifle range; the tents of the second
regiment will be run in lines parallel
to the rifle range, the nearest line be?
ing 50 yards from ths range; the
Charleston Light Dragoons will camp
on the other side of the range from
the Second regiment.
All the tents will bo pitched on
high, sandy soil, where the natural
drainage facilities are excellent. It
Is said that there will be no puddles
standing 30 minutes after a rain.
"The camp is ideally situated from
a sanitary point of view," said Maj.
A. Moultrie Brallsford of Mulllns, yes?
terday, after he had returned from an
inspection of Styx. "By the time the
troops are encamped further sanitary
measures will be completed with the
construction of a latrine and an in?
cinerator for each company. All garb?
age and scraps will be burned In the
Incinerators."
Maj. Brallsford has ordered 3,000
packages of anti-typhoid fever vac?
cine and each militiaman will be In?
oculated unless he has recently un?
dergone tho treatment.
Water for the camp will be taken
from Congarec creek, which runs at
the foot of a hill about 1,800 feet
away from the camping grounds.
Water mains have already been laid
for one regiment and will be laid to?
day and tomorrow for the other regi?
ment and the cavalry troop. The ad?
jutant general was yesterday author?
ized by the war department to expend
$2,500 for the Installation of an ade
Iquatc pumping plant.
By road Styx Is about seven miles
from Columbia. The plot of land,
containing 1,007 acres, lies between
the oouthern and Seaboard Air Line
railways, the nearest railway station
on the former being Styx and on the
latter, Dixiunna. By automobile the
route passes over the old State road
for about a mile beyond Cayce, where
the road to Kinsler branches off to the
right. Several hundred yards beyond
the station at Kinsler the road again
branches, the one to the right being
a circuitous route by way of Styx,
while tho one to the left, which Is
much the worse road, leads almost di?
rectly to the camp site.
As soon as possible work will be
done on these two roads so as to
afford an easy trip from Columbia to
the camping ground. For tho pres?
ent, however, ('apt. Warren will con
line his force largely to building the
r<?ad from the depot at Styx to the
camping grounds,
