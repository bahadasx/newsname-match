From the Stat Africultural Collate
Manhattan, Kan., June 9. An
nouncement of results of calf feeding,
pasture improvement and blackleg
serum experiments, that are expect
ed to put the cattle industry in Kan
sas on a paying basis, and incidentally
place millions of dollars in the pock
ets of Kansas farmers, was the feat
ure of the fourth annual cattlemen's
meeting at the Kansas State Agricul
tural college. The meeting was at
tended by several hundred of the
leading live stock men of the state.
Corn and kafir for beef production
compared in the tests covering a per
iod of six months and conducted un
der the direction of W. A. Cochel,
professor of animal husbandry. One
hundred high grade Hereford calves
were used, being divided into six lots,
each of which was given a different
feed combination.
The greatest profits were made in
corn combinations. Shelled corn,
cottonseed meat, alfalfa hay and sil
age proved most remunerative the
average profit per steer was $15.26,
and the total gain in weight 436.3
pounds. In the lot feed ground corn,
cottonseed meal, and alfalfa bay, a
gain in weight of 441.9 pounds was
recorded, but the higher feed values
reduced the profits to $13 25 for each
animal.
The kafir combination that brought
the best results consisted of ground
kafir, cottonseed meal, alfalfa hay
and silage. The gain in weight
shown was 424.1 pounds and the pro
fit $13.14.
Announcement was made by Prof.
F. S. Schoenleber, professor of veter
erinary medicine, that his depart
ment has perfected a practical meth
od of absolute preventing, stopping,
and controlling an outbreak of black
leg among cattle.
"A hyperimmune serum has been
perfected," said Dr. Shoenleber,
"which will immediately stop the
progress of the disease in a herd and
which when used in connection with
blackleg virus will immunize the an
imal against the disease. This serum
and virus has been used successfully
on more than 20,000 calves. "-
Experiments in pasture improve
ment were explained by Dr. W. If.
Suitatorium
Wakeeney, Kansas
Jardine, dean division of agriculture.
The work will cover a period of sev
eral years, and is expected to be of
great value to Kansas farmers. "Pas
tures are the basis of the cattle in
dustry," commented Dr. H. J, Wat
ers, president of the college, who pre
sided at the morning session. "One
of the largest and most neglected in
vestments Kansas has is her pas
tures." Dr. O. M. Franklin, assistant in
veterinary medicine, read a paper on
new blackleg serum. L. E. Call,
professor of agronomy, told of experi
mental work with crops and soils. F.
P. Hanson, president of the Stock
Yards National bank, Wichita, spoke
on "Financing the Cattleman." Dr.
C. F. Curtis, dean of agriculture at
the Iowa State college, discussed
"The Influenee of Purebred Live
Stock on the Cattle Feeding Indus
try." The visitors were taken over
the college farm in automobiles fur
nished by the Manhattan Commer
cial club.
TO CHECK AUTO THEIFTS
J. T. Botkin, secretary of state, has
written a letter to auto owners ask
ing their co-operation in giving
prompt notice of auto thefts, or sus
pected thefts. He says, in part:
"The office is now keeping a card in
dex to all cars registered by their en
gine numbers, and taking other steps
to prevent the theft of machines and
to assist the officers of the law in its
enforcement.
"You can greatly assist this depart
ment by seeing that we have your
correct engine number and descrip
tion of your car, and by notifying
this office promptly should your car
be sold or stolen; also by promptly
notifying us of any information or
suspicions you may have concerning
the theft of any car or any car thief.
Any information of this kind will be
treated as strictly confidential."

Governor Capper Files Nomination
Papers
I Topeka. June 20 Governor Capper
I today tiled his nomination papers
with the secretary of state and an
nounced that he is a candidate for a
second term. He will have no oppo
sition for the Republican nomination.
In a statement given to the newspa
pers. Governor Capper said:
"Naturally, I would like to feel the
people bad enough faith in me to vote
me a second term. I do not ask any
one to support me because it has been
the custom to give a public official 2
terms. I prefer Kansas should decide
this question strictly on the merits
of the candidates, as it always should
be decided. Doubtless I have made
mistakes, but they have been honest
mistakes, and I believe my seventeen
months of experience has greatly in
creased my official usefulness. Al
though a governor may have lived all
his life In Kansas, as I have done, his
first term should be spent in investi
gating, planning, initiating impera
tively needed reforms.
"Within little more than a year I
have personally inspected from top to
bottom, every one of the state's eigh
teen educational, charitable and re
formatory institutions. Many of
them twice. I have suggested or
made changes at every one. I have
also had searching .. investigations
made into their condition and man
agement by experts and by impartial
citizens. They have never before
been so thoroughly probed and scruti
nized. We have let daylight into
everything connected with them.
Whatever has been found, whether
good or bad, ha3 been made public
without reservation and irrespective
of whom it hurt. We have discover
ed that in the course of years some of
these institutions have fallen behind,
Judged by new and rising standards,
and must as quickly as possible be
brought to a condition of efficiency
surpassing any previous stage of their
history. This can be done extrava
gantly or sensibly. We propose to do
it well but sensibly. As far as possi
ble we are meeting needs, correcting
evils, eliminating waste. The legis
lature will be called on to do what
only a .legislature can do, and with
the carefully digested- Information
we shall be able to lay before it, no
legislature Kansas has ever had will
be so well prepared to act promptly,
intelligently and effectively.
"Many of these things are being
accomplished with great difficulty.
Kansas has a number of hold over
political boards that control the state
institutions absolutely., Heretofore
no Kansas governor has had to work
with boards not of his own choosing.
- "I have been cutting off useless in
spectors and unnessary employes. A
recent example is the State Fish
Hatchery, where a force of twenty
was reduced to nine. I have given
every state employe to understand
no person can hold a job under this
administration simply because he
"votes right." We are enforcing the
new civil service law and retaining
every first class man I find in the
state's service regardless of his poli
tics. A governor who does less vio
lates bis oath. I am trying to dis
charge my duties faithfully and con
scientiously. Trying to be just and
fair. Trying to give every one in
Kansas a square deal. Trying to be a
governor of the whole people.
"I shall continue to work for econ
omy and efficiency in state and coun
ty government, whether in or out of
office. To simplify and modernize
the entire system of public business
is the big problem of the present and
the future of Kansas. This does not
mean a cheese-paring policy, nor an
extravagant or wasteful one, but a
policy and a determination to get 100
cents of genuine service for every dol
lar that is spent and not a cent less."
MITCHELL COUNTY FOR BENTON
As the weeks roll by and the time
before the primary grows shorter, it
becomes move evident that Otis L.
Benton of Oberlin, Kansas, is going
to be nominated ' for congressman
from the Sixth district and that be
will carry Mitchell couuty the home
of his opponent by a good majority.
Mr. Benton is a business man and
farmer who has made a success of his
various enterprises and his stand on
tike big questions of interest to the
voters of the Sixth district is right.
His life in Decatur county the past
thirty years has proven him to be t
man well qualified for the job of Con
gressman and the Republicans of this
section will give him a hearty sup-
part Glen Elder Sentinel (Mitchell
County).
Pete Mathewson is employed at the
Farmer's elevator at this place.
Dictagrams
The Wa-Keeney folks never have a
public "feed" without "rolls" being
a conspicuous part of the "eats."
Now, the average "roll" is just about
the rawest, most indigestible thing
that ever distressed a -stomach, and
so, when a rare exception does show
up, Aunt Slmpy has a great curiosity
to know who made it.
Qliite a number of the finest cooks
on earth live right here in Wa-Keeney"
but Uncle Heck suspects that
some of the best of them have not
discovered the fact that stewed
chicken and biscuit do not constitute
"chlckenpie." At least, not "like
mother used to make."
Likewise, with berries and buscuits
(with plenty of trimmings) make a
passable imitation, it is a misnomer
to ball it -"shortcake." It is a libel
on both ends of the word and a reflec
tion on these real artists who make
the genuine article.
Of course no mere man could con
coct a thing fit to eat or drink, to
save Ids life, but some of them are
experts at the manger.
Qld Si recent made a trip to Gig
badk and has been talking about his
visit ever since he got home. He
say j the good women of that town
are organized into a society which
they call "The Free Will Sacrificials"
and they never turn down a job on
account of hard work and financial
loss". Even if the beneficiaries are
young and strong, able to work and
able to pay full price for what they
get, yet, upon the slightest hint
that there is something to do, these
sacxificials hop to it with might and
main, day and night, and pull it
across. And to miss such a chance
for service would cause some of these
kind-hearted old ladies to lose sleep
for a month.- . -i
Of course the folks who have been
trading dimes for dollars, year after
year, might feel disappointed if the
privilege were suddenly withdrawn,
sf-tfcere is no one else to do itV
.- " - " o '. . " '
i ,-r . . -
The cost of living has been doubled
unless you can persuade some char
itable association to provide the eats
at the prices which prevailed twenty
years ago.
Let it be said here that "Old Si,'
"Aunt Simpy," and "Uncle Heck"
are wholly fictitious characters, the
latter being the only one of the three
their creator cares to associate with.
o
We bad the pleasure of walking up
the street with a little lady one day
recently, and when we parted at the
corner she very kindly invited us to
"Come over some day." At first we
were about to accept the invitation,
but some afterthought caused her to
repeat it and say "Come over some
day and play with my papa." We
had to decline. Her papa weighs 247
and we found it advisable to cut out
the rough stuff several years ago. But
we shall never forget the invitation;
it was kind and neighborly; without
guile, or thought of serious onse
quences.
MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards. June 19.
Arrivals of cattle today were much
larger than expected and the market
had a decidedly weaker tendency ex
cept for strictly dry lot steers, and
few in that class was offered. The
day's trade added nothing new in the
general tendency in the market, as
the price movement is increasing' the
spread in quotations, by maintaining
high record levels for the dry lot
steers, and the half fat. especially
those cattle that have made weight
gains on grass, are lower. The ex
tremes in the market today were
steady to fifteen cents lower, mostly
ten cents off. The fat steers here to
day came from a wide area, Texas
sending in liberal supplies from be
low the quarantine line. A train
load of steers came from Arizona.
Oklahoma, Colorado and Nebraska
were fairly well represented and Kan
sas bad a good many winte.ed, grass
fat steers here today. The range In
prices was $6.50 to $10.75, mostly $3.25
to $10.25. The lowest priced steers
were on the quarantine side. Cows
and heifers were in limited supply
and mostly steady in prices. Demand
for stockers and feeders was active,
and prices for stockers was stronger.
Receipts were limited. Most of the
good stockers sold at $7.50 to $3, and
feeders up to $3.50.
Hog prices were down 5 to 10 cents

nave just agreed on an expenditure
of approximately $1,000,000 for im
proving the Kansas City-Denver line.
There has been much work on this
road for several years and when that
which has been authorized is finished
the line will be on a par with the
Omaha-Ogden route of the Union Pa
cific. . ..
One of the items just .authorized is
the ballasting with Sherman granite
on the line between Oakley and Ellis,
seventy-four miles. This will com
plete the ballasting of the line be
tween Kansas City and Limon, Colo,,
550 miles.. This will cost about $300,
000. The entire system from Kansas
City to . the Colorado terminals will
be relaid with SJO-pound steel. This
will cost about $200,000. There will
be new steel bridges put in costing
$125,000.
Electric block signals will be in
stalled between Salina and Ellis at
an estimtted cost of $175,000. This
will complete the electric block sig
nals between Kansas City and Ellis,'
about 303 miles. '
This is one of the biggest expend!-,
tures made by any western road this
season and the work is to be pushed
as fast as men and money can do it. .
