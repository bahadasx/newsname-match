If the newspapers will tell their

price of some inks has increased
400 per cent; that lags, the raw
material for paper making, is also
iis««l for the manufacture of high
explosives and has ascende»! in
cost on a level with the Kiffel
Tower; that French bleach, so ne
cessary for the manufacture of pa
per, can hardly be had at any
price, and that a scorn of other nc
cessary chemicals have jumped al
most out of sight, they will find
then tasks of raising raft's much
easier. I hat all newspapers will
be compelled to take such action
is certain. Many have already
done so, and the paper attempting
to adhere to its old rate basis will
soon find the sheriff locking the
front door. The big paper mills
of the country see no relief in
sight for many months, even
should the great war cease this
summer, somethin# now unexpect
ed. The newspapers of this coun
try will lie compel led to do what
the big manufacturers have al
ready done—raise their rates in
proportion to the increased cost of
production.

'•What the modern child suffers
from most seriously," says Prof
essor John Dewey of Columbia
University, "is tiiat his schooling
Is chiefly directed toward making
him absorb a great deal of Infor
mation upon a number of subjects
which are not linked in any vital
way with the praotiotb details of
the life which the child is about
to enter.
It is just such a condition as
this tiiat our agricultural and
domestic science schools are de
signed to remedy. It is only In
recent years that the boys and
girls of the farms have been
taught the fundamental and prac
tical things that apply to every
day farm life. In Louisiana there
are fifty two agricultural schools
and more than one hundred
schools with domestic science de.

10,000 young people are receiving

Mr Joe Davis has become one
of tb«' most successful organize!*
in UiiH state in tins order. Hi
has made a wondeiful record in
building memberships and msti
tuting new camps—even in cut
over territory. He demonstrated
his ability as an organizer in this
immediate territory, then branch
ed out into new territory, lit*
territory was pradualiy extended
till if. covered ten parishes. On
Monday of this week, after a
brief visit home, he left hero for
Rapides parish, where he enters
new territory. The parishes id
Evangeline and Allen have also
been added to Ins territory, msk
ing about twelve and a half par
ishes altogether. In Rapides is
located another organizer, but
there are parts of ihat parish
which may he winked ad vaut agi -
orisly fiorn points beyond the par
ish bordeis, and th«»se have been
assigned to Mr. Davis.
Next spring the state encamp
ment of tin* order will be held in
this city. It is expected tlint
there will be some people in town
for that occasion! Besides tin
delegates from over s«>ven him
dred camps, there »\tfll be in tin
neighborhood of six hundred lady
delegates r« presenting the Wood
Bien Circles of the state. A fur
ther iufiluetice which will swell the
gathering here will ire a very
large class of candidates for the
degrees of the order. These can
didates will be recruited by tin*
several camps iu Mr. Davis' dis
triet of twelve or more parishes.
This coming convention prom,
ises to be the grandest affair ever
undertaken for this place and will
set a new high water mark for at.
tendance. It is possible that ev
ery hospitable family in the town
will have ample opportunity of*
demonstrating how cordial and
kind they can tie to the stranger
