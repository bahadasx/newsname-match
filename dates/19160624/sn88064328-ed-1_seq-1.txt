Americans.
El Paso, .rune 21.— American
and ('arnviza troops fought a,
Moody battle today only a few
hours after President Wilson's
»iliOH -word rebuke to Gen. Car
rnnza had gone forward yester
day to Mexico City. With which
side victory rested is not known.'
The engagement took place on
the Santo Domingo ranch, near
the Mexican town of Carrizal,
nine miles southwest of Villa
Ahumada, the Mexican field head
quarters in northern Chihuahua,
The number of dead was not
definitely known here toii'ght, but
a score of General Perishings'
men are said to have been killed
and the Mexicans are said to have
lost more than two score.
Seventeen Americans are de
clared by Mexican officials to
have 'been captured and to have
been hurried to Chihuahua City
under adequate guard.
A machine gun use«] by the
Americans is reported to have
done heavy execution. |
The Americans engaged are
thought to have been members
of a troop from the Tenth cavalry,
a negro regiment, returning from
a scouting trip to Gusman. :
The size of the Mexican force,
whose commander, Geo. Felix Go
mez, was killed, is not known.
News of the battle was received
in Juarez early this afternoon by !
Gen. Francisco Gonzales, Car
ranza commander of the military,
zone of the border. For some
reason or other. General G0nzalel.fSrcds.
kept the story secret until late in (tfr
the afternoon, when am ^merican«
J. C. Hubbel, fetimtwg'fto the
border from the interior, brought
to El Paso the news that he had
seen numbers of Mexicans dead
along the Mexican Central tracks
at Villa 'Ahmuda and had been
told that there had been an en
counter with the "gringoes."
General Gonzales' first step
after confirming the news was to
issue a statement placing the
blame on the American comman
der. Ile charged that the Amer
ican troops fired first on the Mex
icans and that their shots were
directed at a courier, who had
just presented to them a request
that they retire.
American arinv officers declared
absolute disbelief in Gonzales' as
sertions. The opinion was ex
pressed that if the Americans
fired first, they did so because it
was necessary to insure their own
safety.
General Trcvino's recent warn
ing to General Pershing not to
send his troops east, south or
west of their positions, was re
called.
Excitement Spreads
When Extras Out.
Excitement spread in El Paso
as extras were issued and the
news became known. Quiet was
maintained, however, in view of
General Bell's frequent admoni
tion that his soldiers could take
care of any situation that might
arise. While awaiting instruc
ions from headquarters at San
Antonio, General Bell kept his
entire force in readiness for in
stant action.
In the meantime, however, word
came from Juarez that all was
miet. although the news of the
■ ... . __ .. _ j .. ..
battle \v as wide-spread there. At
an early hour to-night the only
official details of the engagement
received here came from the

Mexican side of the river. Gen
eral Gonzals said his information
was transmitted to him from Villa
Winmail» bv General Rivsn« who

Arredondo Demands U. S.
Explain 'Attack' at Carrizal.
Washington, June 22.—An offi
cial communication from the Mcx
iean foreign office, announcing the
clash between Mexican and Amer
iean troops at Carrizal and say
nig the defactor gvernment, found
it difficult to understand why the
Americans should have been so
far away from their base, was de
livered to Secretary Lansing to
day by Elisea Arredondo, the Mex-1
iean ambassador designate.
The communication telegraphed
by Gen. Aguilar .Carranza's for
jei«jn minister, follows:
''Please bring to the attention
of the department of state that an
engagement occurred today
(twenty-first) at Carrizal, near
Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua, be
tween American forces number
in g about 200 men with a force
of oi|r government during which
lengageinet Gen. Felix Gomez and
several of our troops were killed.

»"According to the statement

to understand why the American
troops that took part in the en
gagement should have been at
Carrizal, a point on the line of the
Mexican Central Railroad some
distance from Ciudad Juarez, and
rather far from the point which
is alleged to be the base of the
American troops which entered
Mexico by Columbus. Further
details will follow."
From the tone as well as the
contents of this communication of
lcials drew the impression that
Carranza desired to disclaim re
sponsibility for the affair, and
make it plain that no attempt had
been made to carry out his threat

Official Mexican dispatches

intended to take the town. Mr.

Carranza Attack May Not
Precipitate Immediate War.
Washington, June 22.—No rea
son for a change in policy toward
Mexico is seen by the Washington
government in Mexican accounts
of the clash at Carrizal yesterday
between American and Carranza
troops. Until a report comes
from Gen. Pershing there will be
nQ decision, but President Wilson
is said to view the fight as an in
cident for which subordinate com
manders probably were responsi
ble and not as an act likely to pre
cipitate general hostilities.
Reports from Mexican sources
telling of the clash were accepted
by officials as fairly authentic, al
though none would believe the
Americans made the first attack.
Te reports created a spirit of
greater tensity than has existed
over Mexican relations for many
months.
Pending receipt of General
Funston 's report, President Wil
son considered the situation ser
iously. Ile was equally anxious
to receive from Mexico City some
indication of Carranza's attitude
toward the American note sent
Tuesday.
The incident yesterday renewed
efforts of the war department to
prepare the National Guard for
immediate service at the border.
It wa ssaid some units already
mobilized might be ordered to en
train not later than tomorrow.
It would take a courier or srr
vivors of the American detach
merit many hours to make their
wav to Gen. Pershing's base.
No clear view of what happened'
coold be had from the Mexican
Statemen ttransmitted from the
border. The stories of the fight j
incuts, iuc|i;diii<r art;
conflict, but seem to indicate that
the Americans were ttapped or
ambushed and suffered their chief
losses from machine gun fire.
It is presumed Gen. Pershing
promptly dispatched reinforce.
. to aid
the cavalry detachment if it was
still engage«] with the Mexicans
1 or its lines of retirement .menaced,
No reports have come from Gen.
Funstori, however, indicating that
. , , ,
orders had gone to national
guard units. Nothing could be
.done, he declared, until a report
fro i..American sources had been

he hail knowledge of additional
troop movements or was prepar
ing to send more men to Pershing.
