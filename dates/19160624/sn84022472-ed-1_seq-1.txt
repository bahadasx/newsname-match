Hartford,'-Juno 24 Thousands of
people, presenting a. sea of faces en
gaged in almost continuous cheering
and hand clapping and the marching
of militiamen accompanied by the
First regiment band were some of the
more impressive scenes marking the
departure of the Hartford companies
of the Connecticut National Guard to
Niantic before 7 o'clock this morn
ing. The troop entrained at the
,Epruce street freight yards which was
dense with people, most of them rela
tives or sweethearts of the ' soldiers
s who were leaving to concentrate at
the Niantic rendezvous.'
Members, of the . local companies
assembled at the armory at 5:45 this
morning and prepared for departure.
Each . man carried a "blanket, roll,

military rifle. The officers carried
.45 calibre Colt automatics.
The . line of march was through
Broad 'street. Farm i n gt o n avenue to
Asylum Hill into Union Place to the
place of entrainment off Spruce street.
When the soldiers reached the corner
'of Union . Place one elderly woman
who formed a part of a solid wall of
spectators, searched the faces of the
men in line as they marched by. Final
ly she spied the one she was looking
ifor, broke through the crowd and
rushed up to one of the boys in Com
pany H. She threw hr arms around
ihis neck, -drew his face down ;to her's
and kissed , her soldier boy1 . "Good
ibye.' , '-, -
There were many other pathetic
scenes ' when the boys entered the
train. Soon after they reached the
yard the trumpet sounded and the
ilmen hurried into the waiting . train.
3?he signal to start was given and the
-long train of 15 passenger coaches
rand five baggage oars - drawn by a
imonster engine pulled slowly out of
.'the yards at 6:55.
'Then began the most prolonged, the
(most-pronounced demonstration of all.
:More cheers ; and handclapping but
augmented by a bigger crowd was
Nheard, Hats and handkerchiefs wav
ed a last farewell and the soldier boys
were off. Mothers pressed small
handkerchiefs to their eyes, fathers
experienced sudden lumps in their
throats. K -
. Col. Richard J. Goodman and the
headquarters staff occupied the last
tear. The supply company and the
band occupied another and another

National Guard of
Connecticut Now
Is Under Canvas
Camp Holcomb. Niantic. Conn..
p'une 24 The Connecticut National
(Guard ordered to mobolize under the
Presidents call, except the field ar
jtillery, is under canvas on the state
grounds here. The first infantry
Irom Hartford arrived at 10 o'clock
and the first train of the second in
fantry arrived from New Haven at
'1:20 this afternoon. The second sec
tion of th4 latter command came in
t little later.
Upon arrival both regiments were
detrained at the station and each
company moved ' away without delay
or fuss. The Torrington company of
1 the .2nd was already in camp. The
.signal corps of the first and Troop
B, cavalry, with a number of detaeh
.menu were on the field having gone
'into camp last night.
The Yale batteries will go to East
.'Haven with the other field artillery for
drill, the state range be ing a-better
place for field drill anil maneuvers
than the ground, here.
It will require naarly a week, it is
understood, to complete the mobiliza
tion of the national guard on the bor
der. This patrol must be maintain
ed and strengthened even if occupa
tion of northern Mexico is under
taken. It is regarded as probable that reg
ular army regiments now on patrol
duty will be promptly relieved by na
tional guard regiments as they reach
Che border.
The regulars, already acclimated
and prepared by months of border
- "work for a vigorous campaign, would
Ibe concentrated at the points from
which a general advance . would be
begun.

Second Regiment is Es
corted by Other Mili
tary Organizations as it
Marches to New Haven
Depot to Entrain For
Niantie on First Leg of
Its Trip to Mexican
Border.
New Haven, June 24. The Second
regiment went to the concentration
base at Niantic today as the first step
towards moving to the Mexican border
for duty. The headquarters staff and
the local companies left amid great
enthusiasm although underneath there
was the serious, vein, the tears of
those left behind and the anxiety over
what might be in store for the soldier
boys.
The second regiment band, under
Leader Fichtell, played its liveliest airs
and flags were flowing from windows
everywhere and on motor vehicles
and the windows of buildings along
the line of march to the entrain point
were filled with spectators but never
theless the occasion was not that of
holiday merrymaking. .,
Before the regiment assembled for
the street march there was singing by
groups, handshaking and more, cheer
ing. A mother shed tears as she kiss
ed her son before he fell into his place
in the ranks and there were many lit
tle incidents which touched the heart
of those who witnessed them. As a
general thing, the spectators tried to
keep the gathering in good spirits.
The regiment on its march from the
armory to - the entraining place in
Brewery street was escorted by the
Second company of Governor's Foot-
guards under Major Kennedy, the lo
cal division of the naval militia and
the Tale batteries under Major Dan
ford, U. S. A., commanding.
Troop A, Captain "Wolf, with about
100 men, left the Orange street arm
ory to ride, to Niantic. j

CITY AND STATE
OFFICIALS PROBE
EPIDEMIC HERE
Examiners Put O. K. Upon
Beaver Brook Dairy-Other
Cities Have Illness.
City and state authorities today be
gan an investigation having for its ob
ject the discovery of a means of fight
ing the epidemic of glandular disesuxj
in Bridgeport. It became known this
morning that a widespread ailment
among cows is the source of much
illness in this city. New Haven, Shel
ton and Boston.
Garget, an inflammation of the ud
ders, is blamed for the germs that
have got into the milk supply of many
places in this state as well as of Mas
sachusetts. Tubercular affections are
also suspected.
Because of the prevalence of ill
nesses believed to have resulted from
consumption of milk and two deaths,
Drs. F. L. Day and E. G. McGovern
called the attention of the board of
health to the symptoms. It was learn
ed that several had been ill, who
had consumed milk from the Beaver
Brook Dairy. This concern today in
vited state officials, city health author
ities and local physicians today to
make an examination of its cattle and
dairy in the .hope of running down the
cause of the suspected infection. Ac
cordingly, Dr. R. D. Martin, veterin
arian, and Dr. A. C. Knapp, city vet
erinarian, and the New Haven veter
inarian went to the farm today for
the purpose of conducting an examina
tion. They gave the farm a clean bill
of health and found nothing the mat
ter with the cattle or the sanitary ar
rangements. Further search will be
made among the' many farmers who
supply some of the larger dairies.
Samples of milk taken from various
dairies have been sent jto the state
bacteriologist for examination. Health
Inspector C. H. Dunbar said today that
if milk is causing infection, much of
it may 'be due to the Insanitary condi
tion of restaurants and markets.
Health Officer E. A. McLellan said
there is no means whereby private
families may guard against the re
ported disease absolutely, but that
sterilization would help.
DRIVER REPORTED
CASE TO NYQUIST
While Long Search is Made
For Motorist, Bluecoat
Knows All.
Because Policeman Charles O. Ny
quist failed to take the name and ad
dress of Max Wiener of 31 Market
street, Springfield, after the latter in
his automobile had struck and killed
Charles W. Hall of Pembroke street
late Saturday night, June 3, serious
complications have arisen. An inno
cent person was taken into custody,
the city has been put to considerable
expense, Wiener has been accused of
running away from the scene.. Had it
not been for the voluntary act of
Wiener himself in reporting the oc
currence to State Highway Commis
sioner Williams of Massachusetts, his
identity might never have been
known.
It was raining and the streets were
slippery on the night of June 3. Near
midnight, Wiener, his brother Abra
ham, the latter's little daughter,
Rachel, David, Rood, David Miller and
Samuel Baskiii were passing through
Bridgeport. -Near Hough avenue
Hall, who is a brother of Dog Warden
Charles Hall of Seaview avenue,
crossed Stratford avenue in front of
the car. Wiener claims he sounded
his horn and turned the car to pass
back of Hall. He says Hall was stag
gering about the street in a zigzag
fashion and that as the car was pass
ing at a six mile an hour speed, Hall
fell backwards striking his head on
the running board of the car. He
suffered a frctured skull nd died in
St. Vincent's hospital where he was
taken after treatment,, at the emer
gency hospital. t ,
"Would you say Hall had been
drinking?" Coroner- Phelan asked
Wiener today.
"He was drunk," replied Wiener.
"Would it surorue Ton to know
that reputable witnessed have testified
that Hall was not a drinking man?"
asked the coroner.
"No; nothing like that would sur
prise me," replied Wiener, but when
we found him he had two bottles of
beer in his pockets. He might . have
been carrying it to someone else."
From the testimony before Coroner
John J. Phelan today it appears that
Wiener, Instead of running away, did
everything possible tor Hall. He tel
ephoned for an ambulance, but his
brother, Abraham Wiener, forestalled
him by stopping a jitney car and hav
ing the injured man driven to the em
ergency hospital.! Wiener then went
with Robert Russell of 30 California
street, one of the witnesses of the oc
currence, to Stratford avenue and East

DISCHARGE MEXICAN EMPLOYES
FROM QUARTERMASTER'S STAFF
FEARING ACTIVITIES OF SPIES
El Paso, June 24 Investigation of
reports that a number of Mexican
spies have been in expeditionary base
camp here recently resulted today in
the discharge of several Mexican em
ployes of the army partermaster's de
partment. The men were ordered by
Captain Lewis J. Van Shaick, chief of
the. intelligence department, to leave
Columbus immediately.
A motor truck train a mile long,
carrying 30,000 pounds of military
supplies, left here today for General
Pershing's base. The train was es
corted by two troops of cavalry and a
battery of machine guns mounted on
motor cycles.
Reports from the' field indicate that
General Pershing is drawing his com
mand into a shorter and more com
pact line. Nothing has been heard
from the field wireless station at Na
miquipa since Thursday night and the
impression prevails here that it has
been abandoned. .
STOP SHIPMENTS
ACROSS BORDER;
WARN RAILROADS
No Specific Embargo Order
ed, But Roads Co-operate
With Army Officers.
Washington, June 24. Custom offi
cials along the Mexican border have
been ordered to hold up freight ship
ments into Mexico and to advise the
railroads to keep their rolling stock on
the American side of the line.
Treasury officials said today these
collectors were acting under general
instructions to co-operate with the
military ' authorities and that no spe
cific embargo order had been issued.
Eifforts to keep rolling stock out of
Mexico have been with the double pur
pose of protecting the railroads on
their own account and also guard
against the . loss of equipment whicli
.might be needed for the transporta
tion of American troops.

years, were missing from home when
the mother returned from work
Thursday. She did not know where
they had gone until she received a
letter yesterday from New York in

the children. The couple have been
separated about four years.

Preparations are being made here
today to enlarge the base hospital at
Fort Bliss in the event of hostilities
with Mexico. In addition, the medi
cal corps on station here was aug
mented by the arrival of a field hos
pital and a field ambulance . corps
from Fort Sill, Okla. A new hospi
tal building has just been completed
and arangements were made for ex
tra wards.
Calm prevailed on both sides of the
river, although some excitement was
caused by the sound of a single shot,
followed by bugle calls in Juarez.
Mexican military authorities explain
ed that the shooting was an accident
but that it was followed by a call to
arms which showed the tension un
der which the people are laboring.
The border still clung to the hope
that the entire command engaged at
Carrizal had not been annihilated
and that the day would bring reports
from General Pershing indicating de
finitely the American casualties.
PERSHING OFFERS
SMALL HOPE FOR
BOYDTTROOPS
Fragmentary Reports Con
tinue to Indicate Treach
ery of Gen. Gomez.
San Antonio, June 24 Complete
disorganization of the two troops that
were engaged in disastrous combat
Wednesday morning at Carrizal with
Carranza troops and then practical
annihilation of those who were in the
fight, was indicated in a report from
General 'Pershing to General Funston
today.
The stories told were almost iden
tical to those told by other stragglers
that reached the transmission lines
yesterday.
The fragamentary reports, showing
that Captain Boyd was still negotiat
ing with General Gomez when the at
tack was made, gave no indication
that the American troopers occupied
grounds which could be readily de
fended or that it would afford pro
tection from the raking cross to which
they were subjected.
No further news from General
Pershing arrived at General Fun
ston's headquarters early today and
what befell the two squadrons of the
eleventh cavalry sent as a relief ex
pedition to rescue the remnants of
Boyd's command still is unknown.
CAPITAL EXPECTS WAR
Washington, June 24 With reports
at hand that nearly the entire cavalry
command of about 100 soldiers may
have been annihilated in the fight at
Carrizal, Wednesday, grave fears were
expressed in official circles today that
not even diplomatic measures can pre
vent open hostilities between the Unit
ed States and Mexico.
Up to late last night only seven
survivors of the Carrizal battle had re
turned to their base in General Per
shing's column 'and they brought no
definite news of the others' fate.
Secretary Baker had issued orders
urging extreme haste and final ac
tion was assured by Comgress today
to allow President Wilson to draft
immediately for service either in or
out of the United States all national
guardsmen who subscribe to the new
oath. The Hay resolution contain
ing this authorization adopted by the
House yesterday, was before the Sen
ate today, with virtual assurance that
it would be approved.
President Wilsbn still awaited a
final report from General Pershing on
the Carrizal clash ar.d army officers
said it might be another day or two
before this arrived.

1 Government Still Lacks Official Report.
Chihuahua City, Mex., June 24 American columns have
been seen advancing from the American field base in the di
rection of San Antonio and Ojacaliente, and General Trevino
has issued' orders to attack them if they do not retreat.
General Trevino said the Americans would get the same
treatment that they received atCarrizal as he is determined to
carry out his orders to the letter.
In this, he said, he had all his svibordinates with him and
they will remain with him in case of a rupture.
The Mexican commander said that it seemed probable,
inasmuch as. General Pershing seemed ignorant of the fate of
the Boyd column, that outside of the additional prisoners be
ing brought here, the Americans were annihilated, although
it was possible more had escaped. ,
General Pershing has wired here for the names of the
dead and the prisoners. "
It was officially announced that none of the "prisoners5
brought here will be hanged, that "not being the custom of a .
civilized country." -
According to a statement said to have been signed by
Sam S. Spillsbury made public today by General Trevino,
neither he nor the negroes knew which side began the firing.
Spillsbury's statement says that practically all the 'Ameri
cans who lost their lives were killed when they advanced to
a deep ditch in which" Mexicans were stationed and when
other Mexicans, getting around to a deep ditch in their rear,
attacked them from the flank.
The 17 American negroes captured in the Carrizal battle
have been placed in the penitentiary here. There have been
no arrangements for removing them to Juarez to be surrend
ered to the American authorities-
The troopers brought here are Privates Page, Peterson,
N. Lloyd, W. Ward, Jones, Sykes, Hall, Oliver, M. Donald.
Williams, Givens, Stone, Harrison, Lee and Graham, of Troop
H, and Alexander, of Troop C.
Lem S. Spillsbury, the Mormon scout captured at Carri
zal, also is in prison. The prisoners were insulted by Mexi
can civilians as they were transferred from the train to the
penitentiary but, according to the authorities, they are being
well treated. ' '
PRESIDENT CONFERS

became secretary of State, cancelled
his morning engagement with the
newspapermen. He sent word by his

ing he could discuss at this time.
Secretary Lansing emerged from the
White House abdtot 10 minutes after
Secretary Baker. He turned to news
papermen and said, . "1 cannot say a

ference that no immediate change in
the Mexican policy was contemplated

Washington, June 24. News that
some of the South and Central-American
republics were preparing to in

concerned.
