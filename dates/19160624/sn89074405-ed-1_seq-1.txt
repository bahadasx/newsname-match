Nothing to Mediate.
Washington, June 24.—News that
South and Central American repub

there Is nothing to mediate, so far as
this government's policy Is concerned.

authorised their ministers to confer
with their colleagues on the subject,
the state department does not expect
any immediate overtures from the
body of Latin-American diplomats. It
is understood that Ambassador Naot

tion, telegraphed his government that
nothing could be done at this time
toward initiating mediation.

W
»v
General Trevino.,
El Paso, June 24 (Special)—In
formation obtained by the intelligence
department of the United States array
is understood to indicate that General
Obregon, Carranza's minister, of war.
and his subordinates have developed
a plan of campaign in the event of
war. against the United States, sub
stantially as follows:
1. The troops of Generals Gavira,
Cavazos, Bertani and other command
ers now hemming in General Persh
ing will make a general attack upon
the American expeditionary forces In
western Chihuahua, at the same time
cutting the line of communications
with the border and striving to over
whelm the American army under
Pershing before help can reach him.
Thirty thousand men, approximately
double Pershing's numbers, are to be
used In this operation.
2. Matamoras, Piedras Negras,
Nuevo Laredo Juarez, Agua Prieta
and Nogales, Sonora, will be almost
immediately evacuated by their rela
tively. small garrisons, after doing all
damage possible to American cities
and towns across the border by shell
and rifle Are. The troops will then
fall back to fortified positions now
being prepared, where large bodies of
troops are being held. These posi
tipns range from fifteen to one hun
dred miles from the border.
J. In the event of too great press
ure from the border the Mexican
armies will gradually fall back along
the railroads, which they will destroy,
to converge on Chihuahua City, Tor
reon, and in Sonora to HermoslIIo and
Guaymas.
4. If the seaports of Tampico,
Vera Cruz, Progreso, Guaymas,
Mazatlan and Manzanlllo are bom
barded, as is expected, they will be
evacuated, their defenders taking tip
defensive positions inland.
5. In the event of continued re
verses all forces will be able to 'con
verge on Mexico City, at the" same
time throwing out mobile columns
for rear attacks and destruction of
communication lines behind the
American advance.
6 .It is the belief of the Carransa
government that any American Inva
sion can be harried so thoroughly, If
not beaten outright,' that the United
.States In a short time will be willing
to discuss peace terms.
He commands one of the Mexican
armies operating in northern Mexico.
He is one of Carranza's right-hand
men and .Is very hostile to Americans.

San Antonio, Tex., June 24.—Com
plete disorganization of two troops
Engaged at Carrizal and the practical
annihilation of those actually in the
fight, are indicated in the report from
General Pershing to General Funston
today. One packer of eight enlisted
men of troop and seven, men of
troop were .picked up yesterday morn
ing by Lieutenant Meyer near Santa
Maria. All were horse holders. Their
stories are identical with those told
by other stragglers reaching the
trans/niaslon lines yesterday.
The total number of men In the
two troops was learned today to have
been 84.
General Pershing, in offering a sum
mary and explaining his conclusions
based on auch Information as secured
from stragglers and. from press re
ports, called attention to the indica
tions that there were 57 missing and
that his reports indicated 14 of these
are dead and 4S are prisoners.
Pershing does, not account in his
report for the number wounded, but
appeared to assume that those
wounded have been captured.
Pershing reported that he received
no report from the commander of the
two squadrons of the Eleventh cavalry
sent forward to rescue the remnant
of the Tenth.
Pershing, in his report today, re
ferred to the number of those who
previously returned to the American
lines as eleven, although In previous
dispatches he fixed the number at
seven. With those rescued by lieu

WOULD TAKE WEEK TO ENTER MEXICO WITH ANY
CONSIDERABLE fORCE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN
WILL HAVE TO BE GATHERED ON LINE AT ONCE
Washington. June 24.—Relations between the United States and the defacto gov
ernment of Mexico are close to the breaking point today as the result of the apparently
well founded belief that the American cavalry was massacred Wednesdav at Carrizal by
Carranza soldiers.
Secretaries Lansing and Baker were early at the White House, conferring todav
with President Wilson. It is known that the possibility of drastic retaliatory action
against the Mexican forces in Chihuahua was given grave consideration. If the Car
ranza government accepts the responsibility for the attack at Carrizal, it is considered
virtually certain by officials that the occupation of most of northern Mexico will be or
dered by President Wilson to take place as rapidly as the necessary military forces can
be placed at the disposal of General Funston.
It is believed that the first act of the Washington government, when full infor
mation is at hand, will be to demand repudiation of the Carrizal attack by the Carranza
government. Reports have convinced officials here that the American troops delib
erately were led into a trap. The only question remaining to be settled, it is indicated,
is whether the Carranza government ordered the attack or it was the work of subordi
nate officials.
In the latter event, unqualified repudiation of his act and the immediate surrender
of the prisoners probably will be demanded. General Gomez, the Carranza commander
at Carrizal, was killed in action, according to Mexican reports. So if he gave orders to
fen fire, he has already paid the penalty for his act.1
"Ifwill require nearly a week, itJs jiwjcratog^.cLfpmplete. the mobilizatioft^Ohe
national guard on the border to make possible a movement in forcelieyond the line. The
border patrol must be maintained and strengthened even if occupation of Northern
Mexico is undertaken.
American lives and property would be in danger otherwise and the first purpose
of any action will be to safeguard the towns and ranches along the international line.
It is regarded as probable that the regular army regiments, now on patrol duty,
will be promptly relieved by national guard regiments as they reach the border. The
regulars, already acclimated and prepared by months of border work for a vigorous
campaign, would be concentrated at points from which general advance would be begun.
Brussels Taken into Zee
brugge—400 Lose Lives
on Mercury.
London, June 24.—The British
steamship Brussels, with passengers
aboard, was captured by German de
stroyers and taken into Zeebrugge.
It is stated that no Americans were on
the Brussels. The Brussels was of
1,380 tons gross, and was built in
1902.
London, hune 24.—The announce
ment of the capture was made by the
owners, the Great Eastern Railway
company. The vessel was enroute
from Rotterdam to Tilbury.
400 Drown.
Petrograd, June 24 (via London.)
—Four hundred parsons perished, ac
cording to the latest report, when the
Russian passenger ataamar, Mercury,
was sunk in the Black Sea by a ulna.

TWELVE PAGES—PRICE FIVE CENTS
IN UNITED STATES AND THE
1ENT NEAR BREAKING POINT
PEAK NOTHING CAN PREVENT HOSTILITIES.
Washington, June 24.—With re|»orts available that nearly the en
tire American cavalry command of about 100 soldiers may have been
annihilated In the fight at Carrlzal Wednesday, grave fears were ex
pressed In official circles today that not even diplomatic representa
tions from Mexico City can prevent open hostilities. Wlien the final re
ports arrive, the Washington government expected to use tlicm as the
haais for a direct refutation of the claims of the Mexican government
that the Americans were the aggressors.
A demand probably will be made that, tlie acts be disavowed and
the responsible Mexicans punished.
It is doubted whether Carranza would consent to a disavowal.
ANOTHER ALAMO IS FOUGHT.
San Antonio, Texas, June 24.—In the shadow of the Alamo, where
the deeds of Davy Crockett, James Bov.ic. Colonel Travis and Colonel
Booham, made history "0 years ago. the citizens of San Antonio today
-are convinced that another Alamo was fought Wednesday at. Carrizal.
and that the names of Captain Boyd. Morey and Lieutenant Adair will
go down into history alongside their illustrious predecessors.
Officers of the southern division headquarters, however, still hoped
that the complete official report from General Pershing would show
that over seven men who reached the main columu cscaped death,
wounds or capture. None, however, dispute t!ie fact tliat fragmentary
reports show the plight of the little hand of Americans must have been
desperate.
According to these reports, l»y the pretense of a parley. 80 miles
from aid, the Americans were thrown off (heir guard, swept down up
on by tremendous superior forces, and raked with machine gun fire.
Thus the escape of over seven is considered unlikely.
