Bitter Debate Stirred Up by Bill
Introduced in Upper Cham
ber by Reed.
GORE DENOUNCES MEASURE
Calls It "Insult to Americanism
of Militia of the United
States."
Government support for fami
lies of national guardsmen on
the Mexican border was cut out
of the Hay militia resolution
today as it was reported to the
Senate by the Military Com
mittee. A provision that married men
or others with dependents may
be excused from service was
substituted.
An attempt immediately to pay
the national guardsmen on the
Mexican front $30 a month failed
today after a bitter debate, in
which it was charged the proposal
would make mercenaries of the
militiamen.
Senator Gore, the blind pacifist
Senator of Oklahoma, interposed
the objection which prevented im
mediate disposal of a bill intro
duced by Senator Reed of Mis
souri. Reed's move was an "insult to
the Americanism of the guards
men, and an imputation on their
patriotic motives," said Gore.
HOT DEBATE FOLLOWS.
Senator Reed's attempt brought one
of the hottest debates of the Senate
session.
"Such favorlSlkm never before was
heard of." shouted Senator Gore of
Oklahoma.
"That amount never was paid civil
war veterans, yot they fought In a
real war, and not against half-clad,
half-armed savages."
This Is a reflection on tho patriotism of
these young heroes. Shall we aaaume
to capitalize their devotion to the
country. Shall we make them mercen
aries? Shall we capitalize patriotism,
commercialize devotion to the country!
' Senutor Reed bitterly assailed tho
blind Oklahoma Senator.
Phrase Doesn't Apply.
"Capitalize patrlotlsm7" ho asked.
"It's aphrase that come naturally to
the lips of a phrase-monger. But It does
not epply truthfully to these young men
who a few days ago farewell to father
and mother, wife and children. Some
of them for the last time.

science. This I? but the thin tdgo of
an cntciini wed go of another multitude,
of p:. tbr.crs."
Carried by Sentiment.
"Now Is not tho time for any ap
propriations," said Senator Thomas of
Colorado." Wo would be carried away
by sentiment.
"I deny that soldiers must be obtained
through paying them so woll that It Is
an object for them to quit private em
ployment. God protect this republic
when It must bo defended by mer
cenaries 1
"It Is cold fact that constantly In
creasing appropriations for pensions
create a spirit of avarice and an ox-
?ectatlon for reward for doing a pa
rlolle duty."
Senator Sherman read a telegram from
Major McCormlck of an Illinois cavalry
organization telling of the difficulty of
getting horseshocrs to quit their jobs,
and urged higher pay for soldiers.

They were located by Troop

SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 24.
-Hope of exact tidings of the

can troopers, under Captain Boyd,
ambushed at Carrizal, rested today
on the relief squadron of the Elev
enth Cavalry, dispatched by Gener
al Pershing immediately after
word of the encounter reached his
headquarters.
There was a feeling here that
the failure to receive any word
from this relief squadron was. of
itself sinister in its foreboding, but
General Funston said it might be
that their progress back to the lines
was hampered by career wounded
from the Tenth Cavalry.
LITTERS WOULD RETARD.
If the Eleventh squadrons were bring
ing back wounded survivors of the
Tenth, the men would have to be car
ried on Utters. General Pershing did
not report whether or not he had sent

Eleventh or to old them.

TIE TILL
Action of Administration to De
pend on Report of Any Offi
cer Surviving.
MUST LEARN ABOUT PARLEY
War Secretary Does Not Think
Escaped Troopers Knew the
Real Facts.
This Government has demand
ed release of the colored troop
ers captured in the Carrizal
battle, and now held by Car
ranzistas at Chihuahua City.
It became known today that
the demand now is on its way to
Carranza.
There is to be no hasty action
by the Administration in Mexico;
there is to be no invasion on the
basis of the facts so far kriown of
the Carrizal fight.
If one of the United States offi
cers who participated in the battle
is alive and can giitfc a coherent
account of the parley with Gomez
and the subsequent massacre, his
report will determine the course
of this nation.
If all the officers are dead then
such additional facts as General
Pershing can gather will be await
ed before action is decided upon.
MUST AWAIT REPORT.
These are the outstanding features of
the sltiatlon to-Jay following a con
ference between President Wilson and
Secretory of War Baker. After tho
conferero Baker said:
""e are, obliged to wait for further
word from General Pershing beforo
we can determine) our course of no
tion. "The only thing we have thus far,
aside from that coming from Mexican
sources. Is the report of a few strap
glers who wore considerably In the r .
of the point where the Can1zI fl ,ht
occurred." Biker sold.
"These men had been left to hold. Mm
horses, and act as a rear guard, while
the others went forwnrd. Apparently
when the firing started snd the horses
began to stampede, these men went
after them, so they were not near the
place where tho parleying was golnj
on. and probably were considerably
back whan tho ahootlng began.
"We are compelled to wait, therefore,
until wo hear from tho two troops or
cavalry sent out to bring back what
remains of tho troops engaged In the
Carrizal flrfht Until wo get that re
port there Is absolutely no chanso in
policy to be coutldcred.
Won't Have to Wait.
"The public will ot have to wall flvs
minutes for the contents of tennral
Pershing's report when it comos In."
It la known hero that tho forcw un
der Captain Bod were under explicit
orders from Oenoral Pershing to con-
tine their operations inclusively to
scouting. Thoy wero specifically com
manded to engage In no fUht, tr to
make no move which tliroutuncd to precipitate-
a light unless actually i-.ttuok-ed.
If Boyd W.ij commanded lo ttnn, or
was refused perm'julon to piocecd. by
General Oomo, and ndvanred regard
less, he violated his ordors, .ind there
will be no declaration of war beruuts
of the Cairlxnl incident.
If tho reports mado so far by the col
ored troopers of the Tenth f.'avnlry.
that Captain j3oyd hid stopped li
march at tho command cf Gomez, and
that the Mexicann fired on the troop
era after they had ImlteJ, nie confirmed
by ah officer, the situation wll be such
as to J'istl'y Wilson's threat to Carran
za of "tho grivest consequences."
Action is not to ho liken on tho re
ports so far received, hecnuso it is re
alized that the enlisted men who es
caped had no part In the parley Le
tween Gomez nnd Boyd and could
scarcely havi beo.i familiar with all
tho details.
Seriousness NotJWnimized.
There Is no minimizing tne.serlousntss
of the situation at either the White
House or the War pepartment.
It Is admitted that the likelihood of
a break has never been so great.
The effect has been sobering and there
Is little disposition to talk.
Both the White iioute and war De
partment are keyed for action. At both
points, It Is admitted that Pershing's
next report will probably decide tho
inue.
