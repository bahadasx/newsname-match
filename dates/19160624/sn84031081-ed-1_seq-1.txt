on'n catT'on state soldiers and pro

machinery with which to hasten the
strengthening of the border guard.
The senate probably will pass the
resolution tomorrow.
Iiiplonintic Crisis I'lM-hanged.
Diplomatic aspects of the crisis vir
tually were unchanged. President
Wilson could reach no final decision
us to action resulting from the nt
tuck by Mexican troops upon Ameri
can cavalrymen at Currlzul or upon
American bluejackets at Mazutlau.
only a, preliminary report on the Car
rizal clash came from General Persh
ing during the day. It was based on
the statement of stragglers and no
word had come from the officers of
th Khcitn.m4 Hf.l!whmont. TI10 lust !
word on the Afazatlan incident will
fellow a full report from Admiral j
iMnslow, commanding the Pacini
fleet, who has been ordered to the i
S'-ene to make a personal investlga-1
tlon.
Awnlt Complete Uoport.
As the situation stands at the statu
department only preliminary reports
on each incident have been received
from war and navy officials trans
mitted as matters of information.
When the record is complete in each
department, formal accounts will bo
submitted to Secretary Lansing audi
the action of tho I'nited States then
vV;videmPnownTn hand is believed
to be sufficient to show that. Carranza
sympathizers or officials probably
will lie held responsible In both cases.
Indications are that the Washington
government will stand on the reports
of its own officers urd refute the as
wrtinns of the MeMcan government,
officially presented here that Ameri
cans were the aggressors, or that ir
responsible individuals precipitated
the clash. It was thought probable
tentglu that the president would de
mand that Carranza repudiate the acts
find punish thoee responsible.
Wllion HoIiIh Vmfereiico.
President Wilson and his cabinet
discussed the Mexican crisis fully to
day hut pending the receipt of final
sports on the occurrences at Carrl

however, (lid not say what would be

less to Columbus, N. Til.) That Capt.
Lewis S. Morey is- either (lead or a
prisoner was the assumption reached
here tonight when no reports had
been received from any of the three
officers who accompanied the troops
of the Tenth cavalry engaged at Car
rizal on Wednesday. Mexican reports
said that Capt. Charles T. fioyd und
Lieut. Henry Adair were among the
dead. Although Rlxty hours had elaps
ed since the fight the only word of U
has been brought to General Persh
ing by nine enlisted men who smug
gled into 1 amp yesterday.
These men all Insisted that Gen.
Felijc Gomez, the Mexican command
er, and Captain Iloyd parleyed, ap
parently reaching an amicable coiiclu.
i'iou and that Immediately afterward
the Americans were led into a trap
from which the Mexicans opened fire
upon them with concealed machine
guns.
None of the stragglers reaching
here were able to give any informs-
tlon as to the fate of the remnant of;
the eiKiity-fonr men composing tno
command.
Military authorities in Kl Paso List

sion that the officer referred to as

been wounded in the .shoulder In
