WASHIXOTOX, June 23. National
guard organizations throughout the
country were straining every nerve to
night to prepare for active service on I
the Mexican border. New order;
flashed over the wires tiy Secretary
linker hole a call for haste.
Roil tape was cast aside and author
ization Riven under which the slate
soldier will he rushed to reinforce the
holder guards at the earliest nossihle
moment. The entire army of 100,000
men summoned by President Wilson's
tnll was placed directly at General
l-'unston's disposal. Congress also took
vigorous and far reaching action. A
resolution adopted in the house by a
vote of 332 to 2, declares that an emer
gency (ailing for the use of troops in
addition to regulars now exists and
authorizes the president to draft im
mediately into Uie service of the I'nited
States ail members of the national
guard who subscribe to the new oath
for that service. In effect the measure
gives legislative approval of President
Wilson's call on state soldiers and pro
vides for their use in or out of the
I'nited States. It also furnishes new
machinery with which to hasten the
strengthening of the border guard. The
senate probably will pass the resolu
tion tomorrow.
Diplomatic aspects of the crisis vir
tually were unchanged, 'resident Wil
son could reach no final decision as to
action resulting from the attack by
Mexican troops upon American caval
rymen at Carrizal or upon American
bluejackets at Mazatlan. Only a pre
liminary and inclusive retlKU't on the
Carrizal clash acme from General Per
shing during the day. It was based on
the statement of stragglers and no
word had come from the officers of
the shattered detachment. The last
word on the Mazatlan incident will fol
low a full report from Admiral Win
slow, commanding the Pacific fleet,
who has been ordered to the zone, to
make a personal Investigation.
As the situation stands at the state
department, only preliminary . reports
on each incident huve been received
f'-om war and navy officials transmit
ted as matters of information. When
the record is complete in each depart
ment formal accounts will be submit
ted to Secretary Lansing and the ac
tion of the I'nited States then will be
determined.
Evidence now in hand is believed to
be sufficient to show that Carranza
sympathizers or officials probably will
be held responsible in both cases. In
dications are thit the Washington gov
ernment Will stand on the reports of
its own officers and refole the asser
tions of the Mexican government, of
ficially presented here that Americans
Were the aggressors, or that irrespon
sible individuals precipitated the clash.
It was thought probable tonight that
the president would demand that Carl-anna
repudiate the acts and punish
those responsible.
Mr. Wilson and his cabinet discussed
the Mexican crisis fully today but pend
ing the receipt of final reports of the
occurrences at Carrizal and Mazatlan,
no course could be mapped out. The
only announcement made after the
meeting was that the policy of the gov
ernment was unchanged.
Further reports from General Per
shing were expected hourly. Officers
here believe that ciHlry reinforce
ments sent out us soon as the rumor
of the fight was heard, must have
joined the survivors by this time and
should reach some point along the
American lines ir Mexico soon. Their
march will necessarily be slow as thev
are undoubtedly encumbered by their
( united.
New indications came today that
Carranza and his advisors, impressed
by the arguments of European repre
sentatives or the ominous significance
of the preparations for war ordered
bv President Wilson, were searching
for a peaceful solution of the dispute
they have raised. Kliseo Arredondn,
Mexican ambassador-designate, made

WASHINGTON. June 23. General
Pershing's report indicating that the
American cavalry command engaged at
Carrizal was the object of a treacher
ous attack bv Carranza soldiers and
virtually was wiped out, stirred Wash
ington tonight with a deeper apprehen
s'on than has been aroused by any
other development in the series which
have brought the two countries to the J
brink of war. ;
While no official would make a.:y
statement whatever .to indicate the
probable course of the I'nited States!
should the report prove true, there
were many grim evidences that teu
sio.i had been greatly .increased. Presi
dent Wilson, who had retired before
the news reached Washington, was
a'vakened and talked witli Secretary
Hiiker over the telephone. At the war
department officials apparently credit
ed tor the first time the story that the
Mexican troops had been guilty of an
act winch could lead only to the most
sennits consequences.
Late tonight the Pershing report told
of in turws dispatches had n it pithed
the w;ir depattment officially. A re
port received from the commander in
.Mexico however, said that seven negro
soldiers who had held the horses of
the others ami had become separated
from them in the fight, had straggled
into tlie field base at Colonia Dublan
and repeated the version of the inci
dent told of in messages-from General
'T 'l- l I . Z. , 7u f u I
The dispatch tonight said that at the
time it was written there had been no
definite indication of the number of
American casualties.
General Scott, chief of staff, in giving
out the dispatch emphasized that fail
ure to get in touch with survivors o
the fight could not in i'srlf be accented
as indicating that the command had
been annihilated. He pointed out that
Currizal was sixty miles from the
American base and that three or four
days would be only a reasonable time
for a trooji to travel that distance over
the broken country of Northern Mexico.
(Continued on Page Eight)
ihe number of people, especially Mex
icans, on the streets on this sitle of the
line, was noticeably diminished.
Extra passenger equipment was
brought here from Tucson ami held
in the vards, awaiting developments
in the i-ris's.
Two Mexicans, alleged to have been
'p'es for a band of 25 Mexican bandits
operating in the San. Rafael valley,
east of Nogales. were arrested by
ranchers in the San Rafael valley and
brought to tire county jail here, today.
The authorization for fight capital
ships, which was approved as part of
a. f he-year construction policy, simi
l.-ir to that drafted by the navy board,
was acceptable to the president. In
addition to providing lor a peace
strength of 74,700 the senate subeom
mittee decided on the recommendation
of Secretin y Daniels to Insert in the
bill a section under which the presi
dent could recruit the navy up to X7,
( ' in an emergency.
Other amendments agreed on are
appropriations of S6 000 for construc
tion of a floating crane at the
I .Mare Island navv yard, and $1,085,000
tite ory dock in the Charles-
iv yard, tor accommoda-
-e'raught vessels; a provi
sion under which officers or the line
above the rank of captain would be
chosen on the basis of merit instead
of seniority.

The two troops of the Tenth cav

by the attack of the Mexican
force, under General Gomez at

GUARDSMEN WHO
WILL TAKE OATH
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
"WASHINGTON", June 23 Legisla
tive approval of President Wilson's
use of the national guard in the Mex
ican crisis was voted almost unani
mously by the house today in adopt--ing
a resolution declaring the exist
ence of an emergency and giving the
president a free hand to draft as fed
eral soldiers all guardsmen willing to
take the reepiired oath. The senate is
expected to concur tomorrow.
A million dollars would be appro
priated by the resolution to aid de
pendent families of the guardsmen so
drafted. Distribution of the fund will
be left to the war department with
the restriction that no family should
receive more tharf $50 a month.
Only two representatives, a social
ist and a democrat, voted against tho
resolution. During the debate, pre
ceding its adoption, several republi
cans attacked the administration's
Mexican policy, and insisted that
President Wilson should have in
formed congress of the emergency in
stead of expecting it to act on its
own initiative. No one attempted to
deny, however, that an emergency
had arisen and Republican Leader
Mann, former Speaker Cannon and
others declared that in reality a
state of war exists.
Chairman Hay of the military com
mittee, author, told the house that it
was presented by the administration
as a measure necessary in, the pres
ent situation and not as a declaration
that a state of war exists or was to
be contemplated.
As introduced, the resolution merely
authorized the president to draft
guardsmen "whenever in his opinion
an emergency exists which demands
the use of troops in addition to the
regular army."
The amendment making it declare
that in the opinion of congress an
emergency had now arisen, was of
fered liy Representative Hay him- -self
and was adopted unanimously.
After consultation with Mr. Mann.
Mr. Hay also changed the languae
of the resolution so that the period
of service for which guardsmen could
he drafted would lie limited to three
years.
A provision for relief of guards
men's families had been prepared
by Chairman Hay as a substitute
bill. After the resolution was under
debate he decided to incorporate a
relief appropriation in it, and when
the amendment was offered it was
adopted unanimously. A proposal by
Representative Gardner to extend
similar aid to families of the regular
army men was ruled out of order.
As soon as the final vote on the
resolution had been taken it was sent
over to the senate, where it arrived
just as adjournment was being taken.
It was referred to the military com- .
mittee with, the announcement that
unanimous consent would be asked
to consider it tomorrow.
A proposal to authorize the presi
dent to draft members of the naval
militia in time of emergency also
was introduced in the house today.
The refusal of more than a hun
dred members of the ntionjl guard
of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico
to enter the federal service in re
sponse to the president's call found
an echo during the debate today. -Representative
Gardner announcing
he w-oud offer a resolution for a con
gressional investigation and Chair
man Hay announcing that he would
do everything possiblj to see that
such a proposal, if introduced, was
pr.iptly reported by the military
cobimittee. Later, 51r. Gardner did
introduce a resolution and it went to
the committee.

NEW YORK. June 23. Assistant
Secretary of the Navy Franklin D.

ner here in celebration of the 2"th
anniversary of the organization of tho
navy reserve of New York that it is
"within the bounds of possibility."
that the naval militia of the I'nited
States will be called out as a result
of, the Mexican crisis. He coupled
this statement with a declaration that
200.000 men are necessary for tho
navy. "Ever yship should be manned
to the limit." he asserted and there
should be an adequate reserve.
protection from raids, by bands from
Mexican territory.
Persistent reports that such incur- ,
sions were being planned in an effort
to run off horses and cattle have
caused alarm among the ranchers.
Several hundred Mexican troops are
located in Sonora, within a short dis
tance of the international boundary.
One report reaching here late today
was to the effect that 600 armed Mex
icans were encamped just north of
the border several miles west of Naco.
An investigation, however, proved it
unfounded.
