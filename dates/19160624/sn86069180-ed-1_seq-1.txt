SPLENDID MUSICAL PROGRAMME
Tuesday morning Louisville paid
its tribute in commemoration of
the death of the Irish martyrs re-
cently executed in, Dublin. The
services, while religious in charac
ter and aspect, were open to all
creeds, In order that all true lovers
of liberty of thought and action
might Join in the exercises.
At St. Mary Magdalen's church,
Brook and College, which was
filled possibly as never before, a
solemn requiem high mass was sung
for the repose of the souls of the
"Irish patriots of 191 G." The sanc
tuary, was draped In black, the
American and Irish flags were dis
played near the high altar, while
the pulpit was tastefully draped in
the Irish colors, green and gold, all
edged In black. Right Rev. Bishop
. O'Donaghue graced the occasion by
presiding at the mass, and occupy
ing seats reserved for them were
Rev. George M. Connor, Very Rev.
T. L. Crowley, O. P., Rev. John B.
Pfeifer and others of the clergy.
Messrs. William T. Meehan, Peter
J. Dowling, A. O'Brien and John J.
Shelley were the ushers and had
little difficulty In handling the big
congregation assembled, which
forcibly reminded one of the old
Land League days and included the
Kavanaghs, Cllnes, Rawleys, Hen
nessys, Shelleys, Noonans, Calla
hanB, Gavins, Dowllngs, Hendricks,
McCarthys, Meehans, Maloneys,
Caseys, Barretts, Llncolns, Weirs,
Laffeys, Dohertys, Dolans, and in
fact representatives of all the pio
neer Irish families of Louisville and
the Ancient Order of Hibernians and
other organizations.
Just before the mass Mrs. Fred
Harig, who presided at the organ,
-played Grelg's funeral march. Tho
Bishop and clergy upon entering the
church proceeded through the main
aisle to the high altar, when tho
mass was begun. The Rev. Father
Daniel Driscoll, the Bishop's sec
retary, was celebrant: the Rev.
Father Frank O'Connor, of the
Cathedral of the Assumption, was
deacon; the Rev. Father James
Maloney, sub-deacon, and the Rev.
Father Cletus Brady, rector of
Sacred Heart Retreat, master of
ceremonies. ,
Rev. Father William Gausepohl,
the pastor, preached the sermon,
saying the occasion was one of con
secration to duty and heartfelt sym
pathy that reaches all over the
world. Love of country was the
motive and welfare of Ireland was
the purpose of the men so cruelly
executed. Father Gausepohl said
the Irish patriots died for "God
and country." He dwelt upon the
pure motives that actuated the un
compromising young idealists, who
gladly gave their lives for the
cause. He pleaded fpr the "rest
eternal" for the men who sacrificed
life, hope and aspirations. He said
the "roll of honor" Included the
best-and bravest of the Celts poets,
sculptors, orators and lawyers. The
speaker said tho events of May of
this year might befittlngly bo
called "the revolt of the intellec
tuals." Emotion was visible when
he spoke of the love the Gael has
for his native land and kin.
The Rev. Father Gausepohl dwelt
upon tho generosity of the Irish and
their motto, "Meum et Tuum"
("What is Mine Is Thine"). Ho de-
" clared that no true Irishman could
be a tyrant; that he had the cour
age of a lion and the heart of a
child, and that only a Jong series
of cruelties had goaded the martyrs
Into revolt for the land they loved
better than life; for the land for
which they so eloquently pleaded.
The speaker expressed the hope that
God will heal the wounds and will
uplift those who are crushed by
sorrow, and said that men like
Pearse, McDonagh, Plunkett and
others will live as immortals. In
concluding he expressed tho hope
that God would bless Ireland, which
was always civilized and never bar
barian, and reward her patriots.
The impressive ceremonies ended
with prayers for peace by the
priests and the congregation. As
the Bishop and priests filed out in
slow procession, "Forget Not tho
Field Where They Perished" was
' played on the organ, followed by
the marching song of the Irish Vol
unteers, Thomas Davis' "A Nation
Once Again."
Flowers were vsent to the church
by James Thompson, of Anchorage,
as a mark of special sympathy.
These flowers grew from seeds im
ported from Ireland.
The music of the mass was fur-
nlshed by a choir of thirty voices,
under tho direction of Mrs. Fred
Harig, the organist. Mrs. E. Bu-
.sath sang Randegger's "Aye Maria."
STILTj OUR DUTY.
The Philippines yet remain a
point of intense responsibility to
the Catholics of America. Because
of the governmental action of the
United States, it has beoome the
duty of American Catholics to
maintain a friendly interest in the
future of the .church in the PhllT
y years American!
splendidly to this!
Catholics rallied sole
duty, but under the pressure of the
last few years general interest In
the Philippines seems to have
waned, and with It the immediate
Interest of American Catholics in
their special responsibility to their
brethren in the islands. For this
reason it Is most important that
the plea of tHo Philippine mission
aries for present aid be heeded. Any
donations for this cause will be re
ceived by the Catholic Church Ex
tension Society, McCormlck build
ing, Chicago, and promptly for
warded to destination.
FATHER JOSEPH NEWMAN.
Rev. Joseph Newman, who re
cently completed his theological
studies at St. Thomas Seminary,
Denver, and was ordained priest
for the Louisville diocese by the
Right Rev. Denis O'Donaghue at
St. Mary Magdalene's church, cele
brated his first solemn mass, at St.
Michael's church, Fairfield, on
Thursday. The following clergy of
ficiated: Assistant priest, Rev. Rich
ard Davis, brother to the Bishop of
Davenport; deacon, Rev. B. J.
Weight, 0. S. B., of Finley; sub-deacon,-
Rev. Dominic Downs, of
SL, Bernard's College, St. Bernard,
Ala. The Rev. Joseph Welsh, of
Hopklnsvllle, preached the sermon
for the occasion. Father Newman
was born at Taylorsville In 1889.
His classical studies, commenced at
Nazareth Academy under the Rev.
Richard Pike, were completed at
St. Bernard's College, Alabama. At
this Juncture, owing to the death
of his parents, he was forced to
provide for his brothers and sisters.
But after a few years he was again
afforded an opportunity of pursuing
his studies. He entered St. Meln
rad's Seminary in Indiana, where
he made his philosophical studies,
and in September, 1913, entered St.
Thomas Seminary, Denver. The
Denver Catholic Register says
Father Newman has Won golden
opinions among the faculty and stu
dents at St. Thomas Seminary. He
Is a very able theologian. For ap
plication to study he has a surpris
ing faculty. His future Is certainly
bright, for his intellectual abilities
are no less rare than the depth of
his sincerity and the warmth of his
friendship.
CATHOLIC ORPHAN SOCIETY.
The weekly meetings of the
Catholic Orphan Society are grow
ing larger In attendance as tho
Fourth of July grows near; and the
preparations for the picnic are as
suming large proportions. Much
routine matter of Importance was
disposed of at the meeting Monday
night, and If any encouragement
was needed it was given by the
eloquent and feeling address of
Rev. C. P. Raffo, who congratulated
the society on the great progress
being made, and stated that steps
were being taken by the society
that would probably make it pos
sible to realize tho $10,000 hoped
for at the picnic. "From the read
ing of your minutes and the re
ports," he said, "evidence Is given
that all are working steadily and
faithfully that the banner picnic of
all may be given on the coming
Fourth of July. Your earnestness
is an unfailing indication of suc
cess." He made an eloquent plea
for tho orphans, and said no one
could refuse anything for the
orphans. All tho commttttees are
enthusiastic in the reception ac
corded them and Louis G. Russell
voiced the general feeling when he
said that merchants are glad of
the opportunity to contribute to
such a worthy cause.
The following places have been
selected to which supplies or dona

INQUIRY
Into Causes of the Irish Itehelliou
Proceeds Slowly at
Dublin.
The' Correspondent Sent to Ire
land Last Slay Has .lust
Itcturned.
Vatched Carefully the Proceed
ings of the British Govern
ment Officials.
SEEKING OFFICIAL SCAPEGOATS
Irlsli I'reSs News Service.
Our correspondent, who was sent
to Ireland in early May, has Just
returned. He watched carefully the
proceedings of the British Govern
ment's official Inquiry at Dublin
and sums up the results so far of
the Investigation as follows:
"The Inquiry into the causes of
the rebellion proceeds slowly and
seems to have turned in the direc
tion of finding official scapegoats
In Dublin Castle, who- after a time
will be retired to the pension list.
Summing up the evidence so far
taken, there is no doubt but the
revolution was precipitated by the
plan of the military authorities to
imprison the leaders of the Irish
Volunteers and tho citizens' army,
the latter being trades unionists of
Dublin and other Irish cities.
"On Easter Saturday, the Govern
ment had decided to arrest leaders
of tho Irish Volunteers and Sinn
Fein leaders. On Easter Sunday
the Lord Lieutenant had decided to
raid Liberty Hall with the aid of
artillery and to blow up the build
ing ft resistance were offered.
Liberty Hall was the headquarters
of the citizens' army, composed en
tirely of labor unionists and the
Irish Volunteers. The constabulary,
with tho aid of the military,
planned to arrest all the leaders
simultaneously.
"On Easter Sunday night the
authorities decided to arrest on the
following day and to deport by
special steamer to prisons in Eng
land all of the important Irish
Volunteer and Sinn Fein leaders
in Ireland, as well as tho active
members of the Dublin transport
workers.
"Before these arrests could be
made the Republicans gathered in
force to resist and their uprising
took place at noon on Easter Mon
day, the leaders having bedn ad
vised in time of the decision of the
Government above referred to, and
they determined to get in the first
blow.
"Our corresDondent renorts that
for once in the history o'f tho Irish
rebellion the evidence shows that
there were no spies or informers
in the ranks of the leaders of the
Irish Volunteers the citizens army
or the Sinn Fein forces in Dublin
or elsewhere in Ireland. The Sec
retary for Ireland, Mr. Blrrell, and
Lord Lieutenant Wlmborne testified
that the British Government had
been unable to secure any informa
tion from tho inner circles of the
Irish Republican leaders.
"The number of rebels imprisoned
in England and Ireland as of June
4 is not less than 2,900. Tho num
ber of arrests during the past
month is larger than the number
of prisoners released. Our re
porter has returned to Dublin to
report in detail on the frightful
condition of misery and poverty
which he observed among the
civilian, population. The country is
still under martial law."
Irish Press News Service.
Dublin, June 20. Cipher dis
patches from Dublin received today

Ifefers to Brutal Slaughter of

.Maxwell's Orders.
Says Regime One of "Worst and
Blahcst In the History or
Ireland.
MAXWELL COMPLAINS OF PRIESTS
Durlng""TlTe decent Irish "rebellion'
it was reported that many priests
In Counties Clare, Cork, Limerick
and Galway aided and advised the
revolutionists to such extent that
Gen. Sir John Maxwell, who has
been made dictator in Ireland, sent
a letter to Right Rev. Edward T.
O'Dwyer, Bishop of Limerick, to
suppress the activity of the priests
and named two whom he accused of
this activity. Maxwell is known as
"liutcner Maxwell" Decause or nis
ciuel and inhuman treatment of
captured revolutionists, and Is tho
same General who was removed
from tho front In France because
of Incompetency and a series of
blunders. Ho was sent to Ireland
by the English Government because
he is a second edition of Oliver
Cromwell and could be depended
upon to carry out John Bull's dirty
work. Take note of tho scathing
reply of Bishop O'Dwyer to the
Impertinent letter of Maxwell's and
the reference to the slaughter of
unarmed men: In his first letter
to. tho Bishop Maxwell wrote:
I have the honor to request Your
Lordship's co-operation In a matter
connected with the present de
plorable situation In Ireland, the
settlement of which I am confident
you desire no less keenly than I do.
There are two priests In your
diocese, Fathor
of
and
Father . of
-, County Llm-
erlck, whose presence In that neigh
borhood I consider to be a dan
gerous menace to the peace and
safety of the realm.
Had these priests been laymen
they would have already been under
arrest.
In this case I would be glad If
Your Lordship would obviate the
necessity for such action by mov
ing these priests to sucli emplby
ment as will deny them having in
tercourse with the people, and in
form me of your decision.
To this the Bishop's Secretary re
plied, saying that the Bishop con
sidered tho action suggested a very
severe punishment, which the
Bishop had no right to inflict on
these priests except on a definite
charge, supported by evidence. If
this was forthcoming the Bishop
would, Investigate the matter.
Maxwell then wrote and gave tho
following patrlculars:
Father has been reported as
on November 14, 1915, speaking in
his church at against conscrip
tion. He Is said to have attended a
lecture by P. H. Pearso on "The
Irish Volunteers of '82," and blessed
the colors of tho Irish Volunteers
at on January 2, 1916, also
speaking at a meeting at on
March 17, 1916.
Father Is said to have been
active with a cortaln E. Blythe,
organizing Irish Volunteers. In
November, 1915, ho got printed a
large number of leaflets appealing
to young men of the Gaelic Ath
letic Association to Join the Irish
Volunteers. ,
He is said to be President of the
Irish Volunteers at and .
He is said to have been present at
the Irish Volunteer meeting at ,
when a certain John McDermott
delivered' inflammatory and sedi
tious speeches on March 17, 1916.
If these reports be true, Jt should
not be necessary for me to make.
definite charges, supported by ev
idence, against these priests, who, I
imagine, will not deny their par
ticipation in the Irish Volunteer
movement, which has led to such
deplorable events all over Ireland.
It should not be difficult for Your
Lordship, under such disciplinary
power as you possess, to prevent at
any rate priests from mixing up
with and inciting their flock to
Join an organization such as the
Irish Volunteers have proved them
selves to be.
The Bishop, so far from inves
tigating, replied as follows:
I have read carefully your allega
tions against Rev. and Rev.
, but do not see In them any
Justification for disciplinary action
on my part.
They are both excellent priests,
who hold strong views, but I do not
know that they have violated any
law, civil or ecclesiastical.
You appealed to me to help you
In the furtherance of your work as
military dictator of Ireland. Even
if action of this kind was not out
side my province, the events of the
past few weeks would mako it im
possible for me to have any part
in proceedings which I regard as
wantonly cruel and oppressive.
""YoiPremember thtr Jamesons aid;

the forces of the lawful Govern
ment. If ever men deserved the
supreme punishment It was they,
but officially and unofficially the
Influence of the British Government
was used to save them, and It suc
ceeded. ,
You took care that no plea for
mercy should interpose on behalf
0f the poor young fellows who sur
rendered to you in Dublin. The
first information which wo got of
their fate was the announcement
that they had been shot In cold
Blood.
Personally, I regard your action
with horror, and I believe that it
has outraged the conscience of the
country. The deportment by hun
dreds, and even thousands, of poor
fellows without trial of any kind
seems to me an abuse of power as
fatuous as it. is arbitrary, and alto

of the worst and blackest chapters
In the history of tho government of

WILSON'S
Proverbial Luck Being Exempli.
fled in Devclopcmcnts of
Present Campaign.
Under Normal Conditions Would
Not Have Possible Chnncc
Against Hughes.
Democratic Campaign Commit
tee Should Warn Papers of
Unwise Policy.
THE LOCAL SCHOOL ELECTION
From a political view the threat
ened war again emphasizes what
has often been said of President
Woodrow Wilson, that ho is 'a
favorite of the Goddess of Fortune
and blessed with proverbial luck.
The writer as a Democrat and view
ing the situation from an unbiased
standpoint, co-aid not see even a
slight chance for Wilson's success
In November with everything in
normal shape, and that his chance
of beating Hughes, the choice of the
united Progressive and Republican
parties, was one in a hundred. This
can be accounted for easily enough.
The warning of Americans to stay
out of Mexico while the failure to
warn Americans to stay off of ships
carrying ammunition for the Allies
was one, and this first reason
alienated tho German-American vote
and its sympathizers. Tho second
and most Injurious causo to re
election wns his conduct of Mexican
affairs, and in this he blundered
horribly, as present events now
prove. His failure to compel or
even ask his pets, Villa and Car
ranza, to stop the outrages of nuns
and persecution of priests was most
grievous, and to add to that mis
take, he classed the clergymen and
higher authorities of the Catholic
church as "liars" when they pre
sented the facts as to conditions in
Mexico, never making one effort in
behalf of religious liberty. This
Insult cost him the support of
Catholics everywhere.
Now this is where the proverbial
Wilson luck breaks in. With war
In sight and of several months'
duration at the shortest, the Ameri
can people will bo prone to follow
precedent and support the President
during tho progress of strife. Re
gardless of their feelings and griev
ances ine puunc will support hji
In a great majority. -andthat -tM
Is true Is already shown bv tlTP
attitude of the local Republican or
gan, which is but a duplicate of
Republican press sentiment else-"
where. The Herald Insinuates that
it is a game of politics the Presi-.
dent is playing by preparing for
war with Mexico and accuses him
of playing to the galleries. Despite
this wall and whether it is justified
or not Wilson's chances of re-election
are a 100 per cent, brighter
and many of the voters who do not
admire him or his policies will bo
found supporting him in November
If tho war is on. And among that
support will be found German
Americans, Irish-Americans and oth
ers of the hyphenated brand, whom
he attempted to ostracize, but who
are Americans first, as is proven
by the dally publication of the re
cruits offering their services to
their country, these lists bristling
with hyphenated names.
Now that tho State Democratic
Committee is organized and prepar
ing for tho November election the
attention of Chairman Cantrlll and
his associates should bo called to
the attitude of some of the Demo
cratic press throughout the State,
of which the Courier-Journal, Times
and Post here are examples. Hardly
a day passes but these papers con
tain matter that is serving to alien
ate tho German-American voto from
the Democratic party, not only In
the coming election but in elections
to come. This dally hammering of
Hughes being the Kaiser's candidate
and continual daring of tho Ger
mans to support him as a unit will
have this effect. In the aggregate
the German-American voto through
out tho United States is 75 or 80
per cent. Republican, but in this
section has always been loyal to
the Democratic party and candi
dates, and especially right liero in
Louisville, whore Kentucky depends
for its big majorities, the ticket is
saved in close elections, as was tho
case last year. Now if this policy
Is persisted in it will mean tho
defeat of Sherley in this district
sure and tho loss of the ticket
throughout the State.
A citizen inquires of tho Ken

the coming election of two mem
bers of tho Board of Education:
"Judging from tho tone of the
statements Issued In behalf of tho
present Board of Education the peo
ple are required to support, but are
not allowed to select." Tho corre
spondent aptly expresses the opin
ion of many just now, and as has
been stated in these columns be
fore. The people as a whole are
tired of having candidates selected
for them by a choice few, this be
ing in direct opposition to the
principles of democracy, and it is
hardly necessary to add that can
didates as selected in the past few
years will first bow to the wishes
of the few who selected them and,
obey last the people to whom they
should be responsible. Then again
there is a splendid opportunity for
me upouiiaing or a political ma
chine with truant officers, janitors',
teachers, etc., who must first of all
obey their bosses. As an Instance.
the last truant officer chosen by
I the board is an active ward poll
tlclan and one of the prime leaders
! qf the Axtoa Bull Moose faction.
