theS. J. Burch household this
week, the stately stork having
made one of his proverbial visits
early Thursday morning, June 15

of a wee bit of humanity, whcm
the proud young parents are
pleased to call "our little son."

two sturdy little men who pre
ceeded the three bright lads will
constitute a trio of lineal descen
dants which, we trust, will bring
additional joy and future honors
to the house of Burch.

Church. Rev. Father Charles

new comer was given the name
