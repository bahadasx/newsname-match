H Weapons Of War
IF the president's war-
call culminates in
r real war as is expect-
I & , ed, if not designed,
" what guns, especially
-what machine guns,
I will our soldiers be
supplied -with?
That thought Is a re
minder. In the fifties
an American Invented
the compound - marine
' engine. His claim for
f it was that it would
; save half the fuel of
t the old-fash ioned
steamboat and steam
ship engines giving
that much more space
for cargo, and great-
ljjincrease the speed of
sc-going steamers.
gThe United States
government engineers
turned it down. The
inventor took it to Eng
land. That country
adopted it, when our
Civil war came on,
fitted it to her block
ade runners and when
our war closed had sup
plied all her freight
and passenger steam
ers with it.
The first aeroplane
was invented by an
American. The great
progress made in air
craft has been made
, under war pressure
abroad. It was the
I ' same, too, with the sub-
i marine.
, Some years ago Col-
1 onel Isaac Newton Lew
is of our army invented
1 a machine gun which
our engineers thought
1 little of, but England Is
:f n o w m n n uf acturing
about one thousand per
week of them, and it is
, possible that those guns
i aio what prevented Ger-
!: many from capturing
Verdun weeks ago.
They are literally in-
fernal machines. This
i pa what is averred as
true of them: "The rate
j . of firing, including re-
nfval of the magazine,
is shots per ten sec-
a s ondB, or 438 per minute

- - ILLIAM NUGENT WILLIAMS was born in Carmarthenshire, South Wales, March 17, 1857,
Jr the son of Evan and Sarah Jeremy Williams, Mrs. Williams being a direct descendent of Sir
1 I W John Jeremy, who founded the house of Jeremy in Norfolk, England, in the year 1250. Be
MS coming converts to the Mormon church in Wales, young Williams when ten years of age
emigrated with his parents to America, crossing the ocean in a sailing vessel and going by rail from
New York to St. Joseph, Missouri, and then by steamboat up the Missouri river to Florence, Ne
braska. Subsequently they crossed the plains by ox team, young Williams walking most of the way.
He grew to manhood in this city, where he has since resided, and in his early youth was busily en
gaged in such work as was incidental to pioneer life, herding cattle, hauling wood from the moun
tains, working on the railroads and in the mines and attending school during the winter. After a com
mon school education ho went to Morgan's College and the University of Deseret, now the University
of Utah.
Learning the carpenter trade he became a contractor and builder, which vocation he followed
until 1883 when ho and others prgani"Pd the Co operative Furniture Company, of which he is now the sole
owner, the company today being one of the leading furniture establishments in the state. He has
always been actively identified with the development and growth of Utah, and besides his extensive

"while exceedingly-pow- fH
erful and effective, it is IH
comparatively simple in lH
its design." The account fH
further says 'it is used jH

The inventor, Colonel ip
Lewis, was retired on ill
the age limit about ten Vlfl
years ago, but he made IH
a record while in the H
army. Some sixteen 'H
years ago, when Elihu vfl
Root was secretary of H
Avar, in 1900, he realized H
that Europe was get- H
ting 'the jump on us" fl
in the matter of mill- H
tary preparedness, and mM
ordered the command- H
ing general of the I
army to designate some
capable officer to go -to
Europe and report on I
the situation. At that
time the late general I
Henry C. Corbin was I
adjutant general of the fl
army and he, on July I
10th, 1900, issued an or- I
der to Captain Isaac N. i I'fl
Lewis of the Sixth U. JIl
S. artillery to proceed iB
to Europe "for study ' I
and observation of sub- M
jects upon which re- " I
port is desired. Captain j
Lewis sailed July 17th , I
and in the next three I
months journeyed all "i M
over England, France M
and Germany and in- I
spected all the princi- J I
pal ordnance manufac- s
turing concerns, and as -m I
he stated later, taking w
advantage "of every jj I
available source of Jm
military information.'' MH
Returning home, he flM
made a marvelous re- W
poit. He pointed out JhI
that our country was IbI
ten years behind Eu- JKl
