HARVARD WINS IN ALL EVENTS
Cambridge Crews Victors by Good
Margins in Both Freshmen and
Second Varsity Contests
New London, June 23. Harvard's
masterful varsity crew defeated Yale
on the Thames late this afternoon by
five lengths of open water in 20:02, and
tonight Cambridge graduates are cele
brating as they never before celebrat
ed. Harvard made a clean sweep of
the river todav and a new record for
the course from Red Top to the rail'
road bridge.
The record of 20:10 has been at
tacked yearly since it was made by the
Yale crew of June 29, 1888, and on this
occasion the fiftieth between the great
rivals. Harvard was seen not only to
eclipse the mark but to smash it to
pieces.
There was no doubt concerning Har
vard's superiority. Except for the first
ten strokes, when Yale, because of a
fast start, led by twenty feet, the phe
nomenal Crimson craft was never sec
ond. It had a length at the mile, two
at the two miles, three at the three
miles and five at the four miles.
Yale was beaten decisively. Its time
was 20:17. Experts tonight attribute
the overwhelming defeat of Yale to one
thing, the English system of coaching.
Harvard university oarsmen opened
their fiftieth regatta with Yale this
forenoon by winning both minor races
in decisive fashion. The Crimson first
year crew defeated the Ell freshmen in
a two mile contest by about throe quar
ters of a lengtli with a fast spurt in
the last half mile, while the second
varsity crew set the pace for the full
two miles and won by less than a
length.
f'e ;v Tablet Will Commemorate
"tyj. on Lake Champlain.
The . y 'Society of the Sons of
the Amerfi-H .evolution will on July
4, place a bronze tablet on the shore
of Lake Champlain at a spot near the
town of I'anton, where benedict Ar
nold beached and burned the remnant
of his fleet after the famous naval bat
tle on Lake Champlain in October,
1770. In this engagement, Arnold af
ter a heroic fight with a superior Brit
ish naval force, near Yalcour island,
attempted to escape under cover of
darkness to Crown Point, X. Y., with
the remnants of his shattered fleet.
His vessels were so badly damaged
that he was forced to land in order to
make some repairs and this gave the
British time to overtake him. A run
ning fight was kept up until a small
bay, known as Arnold's bay, near I'an
ton, was reached, where Arnold ran his
ships aground and burned them.
Owing to the difficulty of reaching
the spot where the tablet will be un
veiled, the dedicatory exercises will be
held at Vergennes, after which a small
party will unveil the tablet. The prin
cipal address will be delivered by the
Rev. G. Glenn Atkins of Providence, R.
I., and there will also be speeches by
Rear Admiral William M. Folger, U. S.
N., and the Hon. ltedflcld Proctor,
president of the Vermont Society of
the Sons of the American Revolution.

Parade of 152 Knights
Thursday.
The annual field day of the trio com
manderies of Knights Templar of this
section, consisting of Berkshire Com
mandery of this city, St. Paul Com
mandery of Ncrth Adams and Taft
Commandery of Bennington, Vt., was
held in Pittsfield Thursday. The fes-
tlvltles began with a parade participat
ed in by the three commanderles and
two bands on North street in the
morning at 11.30 o'clock. In the pa
rade were exactly 152 Knights Tem
plars from the three commanderies
These were divided as follows: Berk
shire Commandery of tins city . men
St. Paul Commandery of North Adams
52 men an:l Taft Commandery of Ben
nlngton, 25 men.
The parade, which left the Masonic
temple at 11.30 o'clock was led by Slier
iff John Nicholson, Dr. George J. An
dler and David Gimlicli. These men
were mounted. Second In line was the
Berkshire Commandeiy band of 19
pieces. The men from Bennington fol
lowed and Fogg's band of 19 pieces of
North Adams was next in the line. It
was followed by St. Paul Commandery.
A slight rain was lalling as the men
marched up the street. The line of
March was from the Masonic temple
on South street to Maplewood avenue
and then back to the Masonic temple.
The North Adams and Bennington
men, who went to Pittsfield in motor
cars, were rather late in arriving and
this delayed the parade half an hour.
All the men in line wore their Knights
Templar regalia.
After the parade the knights were
taken to Hick's grove, which Is about
a mile from the Berkshire Inn on the
Berkshire park road on the way to
Cheshire, in automobiles and special
trolley cars and a dam bake was
served there at 1 o'clock.
retrograd, June 24. The Russian

Eight hundred prisoners were taken.

report from Bucharest states that the
Russians have taken possession of

The information that the Germans
and Austrlans are bringing up rein
forcements from the French and

munication from Petrograd. Accord
ing to speculations in Paris, the tor
nado of artillery fire on the Verdun

San Antonio, Tex., June 24. One

A detachment of the 10th cavalry
found the stragglers who constituted
the detail that guarded the horses at
the time of the fight. They had 25
horses with them. Their stories of the
battle did not differ from reports that
have already been recived.
BRIDGE DESTROYED
Bridge at Percey's Corner Hit by
Heavy Truck.
The old wooden bridge at Percey's
Corners sulfered two mishaps Friday,
the last one almost demolishing it.
Tho bridge was known to be weak and
material had already been collected
there to construct a new one as soon
as the West road was opened up and
the traffic became a little lighter.
Sometime in the morning Friday, a
touring car passed over the bridge and
rii ped the railing almost completely
from one side. Later in the day, the
heavy truck which was recently
In ought from Troy to convey the trans
formers from the station to the elec
tric light plant passed over the bridge.
The weight was too much for its
weakened condition and the bridge was
broken almost completely in two, the
truck escaping all injury.
For a short time, it was necessary
for traffic to pass thiough the brook,
ut the trolley bridge was soon graded
up to permit the passage of ordinary
traffic. The new bridge Is now under
construction and will be completed
I'.hin a lew days.

AMERICAN AVIATOR KILLED
San Antonio, Tex., June 23. Of the
two troops of the Tenth cavalry under
Captain Charles T. Boyd, attacked by
Mexican forces under General Gomez
at Carrizal Wednesday, only a hand
ful escaped, according to indications in
a fragmentary report received by Gen
eral Funston from General Pershing
tonight.
General Pershing's message declared
seven survivors in all, including those
who arrived last night, have reached
the main column. All were enlisted
men but the report did not say whet
her there were non-commissioned offi
cers among them.
According to the stories of the sur
vivors, as outlined in General Persh
lug's report, a mounted force of Mexi
cans made a charge from the Hank, at
the conclusion of a parley between Cap
tain Boyd and General Gomez, at the
same time that a machine gun opened
tire from the front as General Gomez
reached his lines.
Captain Boyd had ordered his men
to dismount as the machine gun open
ed lire and the combined effect of the
Mexican charge, the machine gun fire
and the rifle fire from the Mexican gar
rison of Carrizal, w hich had almost sur
rounded the little American force, un
dor cover of the parley sought by Gen
eral Gomez to discuss whether Captain
Boyd should be allowed to pass
through the town, stampeded the
horses. No details were made known
to General Pershing as to whether the
Mexican charge was checked.
With their mounts gone, caught with
out means of escape, ringed about on
three sides with the fire of an over
whelming force, the fate of the little
detachment Is believed by officers here
to have been sealed. It Is feared that
only the most stupendous luck, backed
by desperate valor, could have extri
cated Captain Boyd's men from the
trap.
Reports from Mexico sources placed
the number of killed including two
officers, at from twelve to forty. It is
repoited that seventeen were taken
captive into Chihuahua City.
The accepted percentage of wounded
to those killed in modern warfare
would plai'e tin- wounded at from thir
ty-flve to forty at the lowest estimation
The strength of the two troops, "G
and "K" is not known here, but It is
estimated that they could not exceed
130 men, allowing for those sick and
on detached service. With only seven
survivors repoited as arriving at the
main column, the number of those a
counted for. at least speculatively, is
pitifully small.
The report from General Pershing
raid the stories of the survivors were
confused nnd did not conform in all de
tails with the report made by the first
arrivals. General Pershing reported
there was a scene of wild confusion
when the Mexicans opened lire and
their cavalry charged. The stragglers
apparently were cut off in an effort of
Captain Boyd to extricate his men
from the jaws of the trap which was
dosing on his command, or (led before
the outcome ol the battle could be
learned.
Toklo, June 23. "Of course any
claim that the Japanese government
will assist Mexicans with munitions
and arms is out of tho question and ab
surd," said Baron lshii, foreign minis
ter, today, when asked for his view of
the Mexican situation.
The interview was sought on ac
count of declarations attributed to
Mexicans that Japan had given assur
ance munitions and other assistance
would be given to Mexico in the event
of war witli the United States.
As for private Japanese companies
selling arms to Mexicans," the foreign
minister continued, "I consider it ex
tremely improbable. As you know, all
available rifles and guns are being sup
plied to Japan's allies to assist in
bringing the European war to a suc
cessful issue. And 1 fancy, though I
do not know, that munitions not avail
able for our allies may have found
their way to China during the revolut
ionary troubles.
Let me say this with all the em
phasis and earnestness at my com
mand," said the minister, swinging
around in his chair: "The Japanese
nation sincerely hopes that armed con
filet between the United States and
Mexico may be avoided. Japan's Inter
est In America, north, central and
south, being essentially pacific and
commercial any event bringing dis
turbance into the American market
would be felt keenly in Japan. This
is especially true at a moment when
the whole European trade virtually is
closed to Japan, and the Chinese mar
ket is seriously upset."
Baron lshii expressed surprise when
reference was made to General Ramon
Iturbe, a representative of Gen. Car
ranza who was reported several weeks
ago to be on his way to Japan on a
secret mission. The baron declared he
never had heard of General Iturbe, nor
of his projected visit. He explained
that he regarded the Carranza govern
ment as the defacto government of
Mexico, and that the usual relet !fra
with General Carranza were being
maintained;
Santiago, Chile, June 23. The
Chilean Government has been in active
telegraphic communication with the
Governments of Argentina. Brazil,
Ecuador, and the United States regard
Ing the possibility of intervention by
all the American nations to bring about
a peaceful solution of the Mexican situ
ation.
Chilean newspapers take the view
that the United States will exact from
Mexico nothing more than a guarantee
in respect of the safeguarding of the
frontier. The view is taken by the
press that, on account of internal dis
orders and lack of stable Government.
Mexico is no longer entitled to the cus
tomary consideration accorded by na
Hons to one another. But in view of
the declared policy of the United
States toward smaller powers, the
newspapers say, it is hardly to be ex
pected that the United States will take
any unfair advantage of Mexico, en
feebled ns she is by long internal
convulsions.
Bennington To Be Represented if
There Is War With Mexico
ALL EMPLOYERS WILL ASSIST
Manufacturers Will Reserve Places for
Young Men Who Enlist With
State Troops.
Capt. J. B. Hannon today received or
ders from Adjutant General Lee S. Til
lotson to raise a machine gun company
in Bennington for service on the Mexi
can border.
The company, if recruited, will com
pose one of the units of the national
guard and will be subject to whatever
orders may be Issued for the regiment.
Machine companies have been or are
being organized by the national guards
in other states and if war is declared
between this country and Mexico it is
probable that every machine gun com
pany will be pressed into service.
A certain number of machine guns
have been In operation in Mexico dur
ing the fighting that has taken place
in that country between the different
factions since the deposition of Presi
dent. Dlai.
Considerable equipment is required
for a .machine gun company but just
how many men are necessary Is not
known. With a full company at least
40 mules are needed to transport the
guns and the large amount of ammuni
tion that would be used In action.
Capt. Hannon opened his recruiting
station in the room over the Noveck.
store last evening. His enlistment
papers had not arrived so that it was
impossible to do any actual recruiting
but a number of young men presented
themselves ready to sign up for the
service.
Rev. Thornton F. Turner this fore
noon telephoned to the officials, of the
different manufacturing concerns in
the village and was given assurance
that any young man who enlists need
not worry about his job when he re
turns. Ills place will be reserved for
him. The manufacturers were practic
ally unanimous in this declaration.

Faithful Animal Will Be Cared For By
Government.
Washington, June 22. Capt. Charles
D. Mortimer, commanding officer of
Battery D, Third Field Artillery, has
requested that authority bo granted to
stable, forage and care for an old horse
known as Rodney, wherever he may be,
for the rest of his life. This army
hoise, now 28 years old, Is at Fort
Myer, Va and Capt. Mortimer's recom
mendation has been approved by the
military authorities, Including Gen. H.
G. Sharpe, acting Quartermaster-General
of the army.
Rodney was acquired for the artil
lery service, at Fort Riley, Kan., In
1S96, when about 8 years old, and
through his entire service gained a
high reputation for Intelligence, willing
ness. strength and all around uniniy.
Literally a "wheel horse" he was never
sick and never known to refuse a task
of hauling no matter how difficult. Ho
was with Grimes' battery In Cuba and
did heavy work beyond the strength
of other horses.
Although he outlasted nil his fel
lows he finally succumbed to old age
nnd falling vitality and no longer Is
able to stand the strain of active ser
vice. When he was condemned under
the rlgli rules of the service he was
bought at auction by the members of
the battery for f 107, and since then has
been given only the lightest sort of
work at Fort Myer. In recommending
that the faithful old animal be cared
for by the Government for the remain

Ignorance, Insect Pests and Extrav
agance, Says Official.
"The real enemies of America are
not to be found in Europe, Mexico and
Japan, but within our own borders in
the form of ignorance, insect pests
and extravagance," says O. H. Bon
son of the United States department
of agriculture. "We ought to have a
standing army of 6.000,000 boys and
girls in our army of preparedness.
"In these days of modern transpor
tation. Increasing wealth, multiplicity
of entertainments, it is well that we
consider tho education that points
homeward. The hoys' and girls' gar
den movement is a back-to-the-homo
education, and helps parents in the
crystalizatlon of those sacred senti
ments that lead to a life-time value
in inspiration and production in the
homely but important arts of the do
mestic life. It Is not an uncommon
thing to find most of our children,
even of the grammar school age, away
from home all day Saturday, Sunday
and much of the night time, and even
when they are caught at home, they
are usually in cnarge or servants,
grandmothers, or broken fragments of
the domestic unit.
"The American people are the most
thriftless and wasteful on earth. We
waste as much food products In the av
erage American city In a single day
as would feed a city of equal size for
the morrow.
