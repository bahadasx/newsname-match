Mcxico City, June 23.—The note
of the American government, in
reply to the communication of
Genera! Carranza demanding the
withdrawal of the American forc­
es in Mcxico, has not yet been
published here-
High officials of the government
declared today that Mexico is not
attacking the American punitive
expedition, but 6aid that by no
means will Mexico allow these
troops to advance southward.
They added that the Mexican peo­
ple were surprised at reports com­
ing from the north, which allege
that Mexico was seeking war.
General Carranza continues to
receive telegrams from various
parts of the republic, offering the
services of the senders in case of
war.
It is estimated here that at
least 500,COO men will join the
constitutionalist army.
The governor of the State of
Mcxico has wired Minister of War
Obregon that several prominent
cltizcns of Toluca had offered to
join the army and expressed their
willingness to contribute large
sums for war expenses.
The cabinct held a meeting this
morning. Although the matter*
discussed were not made public,
it was understood the internation­
al situation was a topic dealt
with.
Wtiwhlngton, Juno 23.—General Per­
shing's rejport, indicating that the
American cavalry command, engaged
was virtually wiped out, stirred Wash-
otlier development in the series which
have brought the two countries to the
brink of war.
While no officials would make any
statement, whatever, to indicate the
•probable course of the United States,
should the report prove true, there
were many grim evidences that ten­
sion had been greatly increased. Pres­
ident Wilson, who had retired Uefore
the news reached Washington, was
•wakened and talked with Secretary
Baker over the telephone. At the
war department, officials credited for
the first time the report
Gen. Scott Issues Statement.
General Scott, chief or staff, in giv­
ing out" the dispatch, emphasized that
failure to get in touch with survivors
of the fight, could not in itself be ac­
cepted as indicating that the com­
mand had been annihilated. He point­
ed out that Carrizal was 60 miles
from the American base, and that
three or four days would be only a
reasonable time for a troop to travel
that distance over the broken country
of northern Mexico.
General Scott indicated that the
war department did not expect any
further reports from General Persh­
ing until relief troops, sent out after
the battle, had returned to camp. It
was suggested by several officials
that General Pershing's failure to for­
ward promptly all the reports brought
to him by the stragglers reaching his
camp, was due to the fact that ordin­
arily little credit is placed by army
officers in stories coming from such
sources. There still was hope that an
official version of whar happened and
how it came to happeln, would be ob­
tained soon.
Baker Confers With Wilson.
Secretary Baker did not return to
the war r'epartment tonight after the
new official end unofficial dispatches
regarding the incident had come in.
Armv officers, however, kept in con­
stant telephone communication with
his house, and kept him advised fully.

No Official Report.
Late tonight the Pershing report,
telling of it in news dispatches, had
not reached the war department offi­
cially. The report received from the
commander in Mexico, however, said
that seven negro soldiers, who had
held thj horses of the others and had
become separated from them in the
light, had struggled into the field base
at €olonia Dublan, and repeated the
versions of the battle told in messag­
es received earlier in the day. The
dispatch tonight said that at the time
it was written there had been no defi
nie indication of the number of Amer­
ican casualties.

Discuss Mexican Crisis.
Mr. Wilson and his cabinet dis
cussed the Mexican crisis today, but
pending the receipt of final reports on
the occurrences at Carrizal and Mazat.
Ian, no course could be mapped' out.
The only announcement after tha
meeting was that the government's
policy was unchanged-
New indications came today that
Carranza and his advisers, impressed
by the arguments of European repre«
sentatives of the ominous significance
of the preparations for war ordered
by President Wilson, were searchins
for a peaceful solution of the dispute
they have raised.
Elisio Arredondo, Mexican ambas­
sador-designate, made the rounds of:
he Latin-American embassies and le
gations with asurances from his gov­
ernment that the Mexican troops had
no aggressive purpose against the
American columns, and would attack
only if the Americans were on the of­
fensive. His advice, however, did not
say what would be regarded as often
sive operations.
Mr. Arredondo was assured bj tlm
diplomats, on whom he called, that
their government earnestly hoped .,
peace would be preserved between the
Unitd Stats and Mexico. If the Mexi­
can representatives purpose to initiate
some step toward an offer of media­
tion, it had not borne any fruit to*
night. Secretary Lansing aaid no su$.'
gestion that the dispute be submitted
to arbitration had come as yet.
