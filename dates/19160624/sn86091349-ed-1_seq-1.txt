Fourth of July na
tion Committees Named
Plans Being Made to Have a
Nation's
At a meeting of citizens of Pioche,
held at the court house last Satur
day evening, for the purpose of out
lining plans to appropriately cele
brate the fourth of July, much en
thusiasm was displayed and there
is every indication that the demon
station here this year will outdo
any previous effort for such an oc
casion. The meeting was called to order
by II. E. Freudenthal and who, on i
motion, was duly made the perma
nent chairman. B. L. Smith was
elected secretary.
Judge Horsey was called on by the
chair for a few remarks and the
judge voiced the sentiment, which
was shared in by all present, that
Pioche should have have a thorough
arousing of patriotism this year.
B. L. Smith made a motion which
was duly seconded and carried, to
the effect that the chairman be em
powered to appoint the various com
mittees before the adjournment of
the meeting. It developed that the,
chair had devoted considerable of
his time during the lay to prepared
ness and had a list of names be
fore him which he announced a few
minutes .ater would constitute the
committees. He endeavored to pick
persons who would take interest in
the matter of getting up a rousing
celebration. The commlttes selected
are as follows:

a message to Lieutenant-Governor
Morris J. Sullivan, adjutant-general
of the state, to come to Carson City
immediately for a conference relative
to the organization of the state

It was the hope of those who com
posed the conference that it would
be possible to take steps at this time
for the organization of a state mili

able discussion, it was decided would
reuire more time than to call for
volunteers, who would enlist with
the understanding that they wer3 to

Mexico. .
Captain Applewaite gave a. his
his opinion, based on previous ex
perience In the organization of state
troops, that there would be no troub
le at this time to raise a force of
cavalry consisting of two squadrons,
which would amount to 560 men,
and also one machine gun troop,
which would bring the total up to
630 men from this state. He stated
that there are many available men
in Nevada who know how to ride and
how to handle a gun.

o' once in recruiting and the n?.ins
f a number of piortiiuent men in ti e
various cities and towns of the state
were selected and they will be ask-
ea to lend their assistance to the
effort to enlist the volunteers. In'
addition to the signature blanks that
are to be sent to the recruiting
agents througout the state, there
will also be sent blanks for those
who are desirous of enlisting in a
state militia, the organization of
which will be commenced immedi

According to the militia laws of
the state the governor is the commander-in-chief
of the organization,
and as such shall have power to
call out the militia to execute the
laws of the state or to suppress in
surrection or to repel invasion. It
is the opinion of the governor and
the other members who were pres
ent at the meeting yesterday that
the state militia should' not be used
for internal disturbances, such as
Btrikes, etc., and that the Nevada
State Police are amply able to take
care of. all such matters. The gov
ernor, therefor, in his letter to the
various registering agents, has
stated that he is opposed to calling
the militia out for -any police ser
vice within the state.

Great Mineral
posits in Comet District
Hill at Silver-Comet Mine a
Rim Well in
If the mineral showings of the !
Ccmet mining district were some
where in White Pine county now
there would be a boom.
Everywhere you go in Comet you
will find ore gold,' silver, lead, iron
and tungsten.
The greatest drawback in the past
has been the matter of transportation
but that problem is being solved
by the auto truck. .The best evi
dence of this ,ia found at the prop
erties of the Silver-Comet Mining
company, which are being operated
under the management of E. D.
Smiley who has associated with
him a strong syndicate of Boston
capitalists. Aside from from the gold,
silver and lead, these properties car
ry tungsten, a very important fea
ture under existing market condi
tions. Mr. Smiley has worked out the
details of a proposition which looks
like a sure winner. When he first
went to Comet no work was being
done, except by an occasional pros
pector. He was not long in dis
cerning the wonderful possibilities
ottered by the Comet; so he obtain
ed possession of an attractive group
of claims and began the task of
rounding out a company to develop
tho ground. ,
It was necessary to do a lot cf pi
oneering in the way of building new
roads before supplies could be
brought in to establish a camp.
Many hardships, necessarily had to
be endured, and Mrs. Smiley bore
her share with him.' But anyone
who visits the mine today will at
once be convinced that the privations
endured were wortli while. As Mr
Smiley put it the other day, ho now
ins things in shape to do some reel
mining; from now on the property
will be a steady producer. He lias
built a splendidly equipped mill of
60 tons daily capacity and it is in
operation. The plant is excellently
arranged and the cost of operation
brought down to the minimum. On
being brought from the mine, tho
ore is placed in a double compart
ment bin, run over grizzlies and
through rolls in which it is crushed
to thre-quarters mesh. It is then el
evated to the fine ore bin; fed from
there over an automatic feeder to
14x24 rolls.' The entire product
next passes thru a trommel screen;
everything fine enough going direct
to the classifiers; the oversize pass
es through another set of rolls and
then to a Huntington mill where it
is reground to 20 mesh. From the
Huntington, the now finely crushed
ore passes to a set of hydraulic clas
sifiers, each product going over a
separate Wilfiey table. The concen
trate is then dried, elevated back
to the mill where it is dropped into
a Wetherell magnetic separator,
which separates the iron nad tung
sten from the gold, lead and silver.
The tailings from. the separator are
shipped direct to the Salt Lake
smelters. The iron and tungsten is
then run over a Wilfley table to
separate the iron from the tungsten.
The iron product contains about $19
In gold to the ton, while the tung
sten concentrate assays from 50 to
70 per cent. The tailings .from the
mill contain from $5 to $6 in gold.
It is planned to install cyanide tanks,
by which process these tailings will
be retreated and practically all of
the values saved.
The mining being carried on is
practically from the grass roots,
stoping from the 70-foot level up to
the surface. The vein is big and
strong and undoubtedly continues
to great depth, while the surface
croppings Indicates the vein goes all
the way across the claims. Besides
gold, silver, lead and iron, the ores
all carry tungsten.
A shipment of 1300 pounds of
tungsten concentrate was made
last week and the company's auto
truck has been busy this week de
livering silver-lead concentrate to
the railroad for shipment

whom Mr. Smiley has been negoti-
ating, have promised to put in a
spur at the Newman Bros, ranch
which will cut off several miles of
the auto truck haul.
The power used for operating the
mill is derived from 80, 20 and 12
horse power gasoline engines. There
is a splendid machine shop, bunk
houses and boarding house, etc. The
mine water supply conies from a
spring about a mile away.
GAMBLING INDICTMENTS
KNOCKED OCT AT VEGAS
The days of tedious work of the
grand jury was nullified in a very
few moments Tuesday morning when
attorneys representing three of the
defendants succeeded in quashing
the true bills and having the indict
tniens against their clients dismissed.
The other defendants failed to em
ploy counsel to take advantage of the
technical errors, plead not guilty to
the charge and their cases will go
to trial, being set for the Septem
ber term of court.
The first case to come up was that
of p.. D. Hicks, manager of the firm
Rot O. D. Hicks & Co., who had re
tained the firm of McNamee & Mc
nainee as counsel. Counsel moved
that the indictment be dismissed on
the ground that it did not conform
to the provisions of the statute in
that' the names of all the witnesses
tfxiiinined wore not included in th
true bill. The provisions of the law
being clear in this respect, there wi.s
no alternative for the court and t'ie
case was dismissed. Richard BusLeed.
representing Fred J. Pearce and Eu
Van made the same defense in be
half of his clients and the cases:
against these two defendants were
also dismissed. ,
It is understood that the oilier
defendants, who had stood together
upon arraignment, objected to the
fees demanded by the attorneys to
take the cases into court and decided
to take their own chances, in con
sequence of which they will be in an
uncertain frame of mind for many
months yet.
The responsibility for the faulty
indictments is not just clear. It is
stated that the district attorney used
the names of witnesses as handed to
him by the grand jury, taking it for
granted that the lists were com
plete, and that the grand jury, not
being technically versed in the law,
thought that tlie witnesses whose
testimony formed the basis of the
indictment were sufficient for the
purpose. It appears that the names
of all witnesses examined must be
stated in the true bill in order to
protect the rights of the defendant
as well as those of the state.
While the other defendant have
lost their rights to demur to the in
dictments, there is a possibility that
they may be able to escape ttlal by
some other tachnical move. In any
vent, the fact that three of tVo de
fendants have been dismissed under
the same so.'t of iu ilctments would
the same sort of indictments wjuUI
be very kne?y to have considerable
influence wi'i the jury.
So far tiiMi'o lias been no talk of
reconvening the Kra:ul jury sot n to
take further action. Clark County
Review.

ORE CARS WRECKED;
RACE DOWN PRINCE ROAD
Dan Lloyd, brakeman, and Harry
Archibald, fireman, onthe Prince
Consolidated railroad, experienced a
wild ride Thursday evening with five
runaway ore cars, all heavily load
ed, and it is only a miracle that
ore; sin,! it is only a miracle that
tho trainmen got out with their lives.
r
The train crew was in tho act of
setting the cars out of the train at
the Mendha switch, at the Pioche
Metals mine, when the control was
lost. It being down grade all the
way to Pioche the momentum of the
runaways steadily increased, notwith
standing that Lloyd and Archibald
exercised every effort possible to
slacken the speed by means of the
hand brakes two of which were
out of order.
In almost an inkling the runaway
train rounded the curve just north
of the Pioche depot, through the
yard and all, save one car, piled up
over the embankment near the oil
huses Just beyond the water tank.
Lloyd and Archibald remained
with the train until it passed the wa
ter tank, when they took the one
desperate chance of jumping. Lloyd
was fortunate enough to light on the
sand pile, but his companion was
not so fortunate in funding a soft
spot. He was severely, but not ser
iously bruised and it is expected that
he will be out of the hospital In a
day or two.
The trainmen declare that had all
the brakes been in order the accident
would not have happened.

Since the first of April last work
has been in progress and develop
ment has revealed some extenstvo
bodies of ore. Eight cars shipped
recently gave net smelter returns of
about $6,000.
A shaft has been sunk to a depth
of 125 feet, all in ore from the sur
face; a tunnel run 400 feet to inter
cept the tunnel, practically in ore
the entire distance.
Sup't James Quirk of the Prince
Con. company, who made an in
spection of the mine last week, es
timates that 100 cars of ore can be
taken out between the tunnel
and top of tiie shaft..
The vein can be traced across
the mountain and -on the opposite
side, 1200 feet away, there is a
fine showing of ore right at the
grass roots. The Hamburg looks
like a coming big producer.
NEW DISCOVERIES NEAR
THE M'GILL SMELTER
The discovery of extensive line
deposits over a field from one and a
half miles wide to three miles in
length, in what has heretofore been
considered as a lead district almost
adjoining the big smelting plant at
McjG ill-is a. mattw of great-Impart-s-ance
not only in White Pine county,
but to the entire state of Nevada as
well. The district has been worked
for its lead more or less contin
uously for the past 25 or 30 years,
but owing to the very low price of
lead, the operators were only par
tially sucessful. During these years
there has been a considerable am
ount of work done on various prop
erties and shipments of lead, carry
ing small silver values have been
made running as high as 80 per
cent.
Recently Henry Goodman of
Goodman Brothers of McGill, who
has had considerable mining ex
perience discovered that some of .
these properties carried zinc ore. Ho
then secured a lease on property
owned by Charles Holmes of Mc-
Gill, after which he induced Mr.
Buckley of Eureka, Utah to become
associated with him in the enter
prise. Mr Buckley was the first
the man to ship zinc from the mines
of Tintic, and is therefore familiar
with zinc ores and after an examin
ation of the property and district
gave it as his opinion that the dis
trict would develop into an exten
sive producer of zinc.
J. F. Brim, who was formerly the
owner of a number of propertiet
in the district and who is still large
ly interested there, was a caller at
the Record office during the week,
and showed a bunch of assay certif
icates, probably twenty in number,
which gave values in zinc ranging
rom J6 tQ 35 per cent Mr Brlm
states that he had long known zinc
was associated with his ores to some
extent but as it was always consid
ered as a detriment to lead ores, he
paid but little attention to it. The
ore occurs in an oxidized form and
was therefore not recognized by west
ern mining men who were not fam
iliar with zinc. The miners were not
lookingfi for zinc, and did not know
it when they saw it, neither did they
want to find it, as it penalized their
shipments. But all this has now
changed, for one pound of zinc is
worth almost two pounds of lead,
hence they are now searching for
zinc instead. Ely Record.
