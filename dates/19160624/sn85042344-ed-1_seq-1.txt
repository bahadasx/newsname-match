Report.
MEXICANS CHARGED
AFTER BRIEF PARLEY
Were Caught in Trap,
Almmts Stampeded, hut
Fought Valiantly.
SAN ANTONIO, Juno 23. The two
troops of Hie Tenth cavarly under
C.'apt. Charles T. Boyd practically wore
wiped out by the atack of Mexican
fori ea under lien. Felix dome at
Carrlzal, June 21. according to Indi
cations given In a fragmentary report
received liy General Kunston from
General Pershing tonight.
Ooneral Pershing's message stated
that seven survivors in all Including
those who arrived Inst night have
reached the main column. All were
enlisted men, hut the report did not
say whether there were noncommis
sioned officers among them.
According to the stories of the sur
vivors 'as outlined In General Persh
ing's report a mounted force of Mex
icans made a mounted charge from
the flank at the conclusion of a parley
between Captain Hoyd and General
Gomez at the same time that h ma
chine Kim opened fire from the front
as General Gomez reached his lines.
Men Dismounted.
Captain Ilody had ordered his men
to dismount as tho machine nun
opened fire and tho romhined effect
of the Mexican chargo. the machine
pun fire and the rifle fire from the
Mexican garrison of Carrlzal which
had almost surrounded the little
American force under cover of the
parley sought by General Gomez to
discus" whether Captain Hoyil should
be allowed to pass through the town,
stampeded the horses.
No details were made known to
Genera! Pershing as to whether the
Mexican charge was checked.
With their mounts gone. cntight
without means of escape. ringed
about on three sides with the fire of
p;i ovorivh"lming force, the fate of
the little detachment Is believed by
officers here to have been rented. It
l.i feared that only the most stupen
dous luck, backed by desperate valor,
could have extrlrntcd Captain Hnyd's
men from the trap.
Seventeen Captives.
The reports from Mexican forces
have placed the number killed, In
eluding two officers, at from 12 to
forty. It Is reported 17 wore taken
ca live into Chihuahua. The ac
cepted percentage of wounded to
those killed in modern warfaie would
place thf wounded at from 35 to
forty at the lowest estimate. The
strength of the two troops, C and K.
Is r.ot known here, but it Is estimated
that thev could not have exceeded
a hundred and thirty men, allowing
for those sick and on detached
service.
With but seven survivors reported
as arilvlng at the main column, the
numlwr of thore unaccounted for. at
leet speculatively, is pitlfrlly small.
The report from General Pershing
stated that the stories of tho survivors
was confused and did not conform In
nil details with the report made from
the first arrivals from the battle
field. General Pershing reported that
there was a scene of wild confusion
when the Mexicans opened fire nnr.
their cavalry charged The strageleii,
apparently were cut off n an effort
of Captain Hoyd to extricate his men
from the Jaws of the trap which was
f losing on his commund, or fled bo
ore the outcome of the battle could
be learned.
No Wonl From Kleventh.
flenoral Pershing, according to his
report, had received no word from the
two battalions of the Eleventh cavalry
which he had sent to rescue the rem
nants of Captain Hoyd's expedition.
He stated that he had taken no meas
ures to support the squadrons of tho
Klovonth.
General Funston said tonight that
he had received no news regarding
a report that General Bell had crossed
the border at El Paso and that no
confirmation had been received of ru
mors of reported bandit raids near
Ilachlta, N. M.. and Brownsville.

directly at General Funstun's disposal.

The senate probably will puss tho
resolution tomorrow.
No 1 I mi I Decision.
Diplomatic nspcts of tho crisis vir
tually were unchanged. President
Wilson could roach no final decision
is to action resulting fron, the attack
by Mexican troops upon American
ciivalrvmen at Cnrrlzal or upon Amer
ican blueackets at Mazatlcn. Only n
preliminary report on tho Cnrrlzal
clash came from General Pershing
during the day. It was bused on the
statements of stragglers ai;d no word
had conn; from officers ol tne stut
tered detachment. Tho last word on

incident have been recelvtd (torn war
and navy officials, transmitted as
matters of Information. V'hon the
record Is complete form-1 accounts
will bo submitted to Secretary Lan
sing and tho action of the Inlted
States then will he determined.
Kvldence now In hand Is believed
to he sufficient to show that Carranza
sympathizers or officials proh'ibly will
be bold responsible in both ivsos. In
dications are that the Washington
government will ttand on the reports
of I's own o'fliers and refute the as
sertions of tho Mexican government,
officially rHHnted here thai Ameri
cans wore tho aggressors or that Ir
responsible Indiilduals precipitated
tho clash. It was thought probable
lonUht that the president would de
mand that Carranza repudiato tho
nets and punish those responsible.
Mr. Wilson and his cabinet discussed
the Mexican crisis fully todav hut
pending the receipt of final reports on
the occurrences at Carrizal and
Mazatlan, no course could be mapped
out.

would be called upon to send her

this moritlnif stands ready to answer

The final step In making the 1(19
recruits real soldiers, subject to thei
call of the president of I he I nlted
States, sworn to defend the flag with
their lives, und their country as long
us they live, was taken last night when
every member of Tulsa's company
took the oath of alleganeo to the
United States, administered by dipt.
Alva J. Niles.
It was while taking this oath of
allegance to the country, the flag and
Its noble history that the members of
Company C, Tulsa, received their first
bit of military color. Soon after the

mi ! the roster was opened for more
recruits.
At 10 o'clock the expected signal
of three long blasts of the fire whistle
assembled those who had previously
signed tbo roster and these weio in
formed that an order from Adjutant
G neial Canton was expected to arrive
at any moment, instructing the com
mander of the local company to en
train for Chandler. In the meantime,
however, it was announced the re
cruits would bo given a course of in

command of Captain Niles the men
in company formation in column of
twos went through half an hour's ex

Then more than sixty were issued

The members of the company were
assembled shortly afler the noon hour
and another half hour was devoted to

of drill that the nun secured their

many onlookers It uppeared that near
the end of the drill the orders "at

recruits just out of this offices and
stores. Those who hud been used
to harder work went through the drill
without a deep breath and It Is doubt
ful if any hastily organized company
ever presented a better front of deep
winded, broad-chested men than those
of company c, Tulsa, when orders1
were given for company front, pre
