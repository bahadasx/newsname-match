Preparations are going ahead
at the Three R mine for the early
installation of a 100 ton oil flota
tion mill. Engineers are busy
with blue prints this week, and
within a few days actual work of
construction will begin.
The Hosey mine in the Santa
Ritas, operated by W. R. Rams
dell and associates, is now called
the Pinal, which was the old
name. It has also been called
the Augusta. Ore is now com
ing in from this property for
shipment to the smelter.
Mr. John Graham, of Webb, in
the Sulphur Springs Valley, has
been selected as the new prin
cipal of Benson Grammar School
for the coming term. He is a
graduate of Michigan Universi
ty and has had a varied ex
perience in teaching so it is said.
He comes highly recommended
both as a man and a teacher.
His family consists of a wife and
one child. Benson Signal.
A deal is pending on the Rup
ert this week, which if consum-
-mated will result fn bringing to
the Patagonia country more first
class mining men, financially able
to carry on mining development
on a big scale. The Rupert is
the property just below the old
Mansfield camp from which pret
ty specimens of high grade silver
ore have been exhibited of late,
and from which many thousands
of dollars worth of the metal has
been shipped in the past. Pata
gonian. Yavapai County roads are
equal to the best in Arizona and
California. They are, in fact,
one of the county's best assets,
as they afford access to the
county's mines over-easy--grades
and smooth roadbeds. With the
intent to supply the increasing
need for additional good roads
to the various mining sections of
Yavapai county brought about
by the growing proportions of
the mining industry, the Board
of County Supervisors has
awarded a number of road build
ing contracts.
The preparedness parade on
Flag day was a great affair,
being three hours passing a
given point. The navy and army
were represented and G. A. R.
vets from Sawtelle and various
posts. Military and civic bodies,
trades, women's organizations,
aero corps. Outside cities were
in line. It was the largest parade
and most varied in character
ever seen here. Old Glory was
in evidence everywhere; the
decorated streets are to be in
evidence for Knights Templar
week. Tucson Citizen.
Suit to obtain possession of all
the property of the Southern
Arizona Smelting Co., bankrupt,
the principal part of which is the
$500,000 smelter at Sasco, now
undei lease to the American
Smelting and Refining comuany,
was filed yesterday afternoon at
3:15 o'clock in the United States
district court, by Attorneys
Francis F. Hartman and Edwin
F. Jones, representing John H.
Martin, trustee for the creditors
of the Imperial Copper Company.
The suit is an equity action and
is directed against M. P. Free
man, trustee for the creditors of
the Arizona Smelting company,
bankrupt. Star.
The new machinery for the
Andes on Red Mountain has been
hauled to the mine by C. P.
Wilson, and is now being install
ed by Geo. C. Chase. The ma
chinery consists principally of a
15-hp. engine, an 8x10 compres
sor and accessories. It was quite
a difficult freighting job to get
the heavy pieces over the hill to
the mine but Mr. Wilson has had
long experience in this work and
met with little trouble. A road
was built part of the way from
the Flux road, and remainder of
the distance the machinery was
"snaked" over the trail. When
installed, further development
at the Andes will be made by
means of machine drills. All of
this new equipment was purchas
ed from the old reliable Santa
Cruz county firm of Roy & Tit
comb, Inc., Nogales. Pata-gonian.
"Some cooling systems are so
closely proportioned that the
stoppage of the fan, or sediment
in the water jackets or radiator
will cause the engine to overheat
and the water in the radiator to
boil," says Mechanical Bulletin.
No. 3, (entitled: "Engine Over
heating," just issued by the
Standard Oil Company.
"Care should be taken to see
that the hose used for radiator
connections has not rotted and
small particles of rubber have
not gotten into the cooling sys
tem, also that the formation of
scale and sediment in the water
jackets is not so serious as to
impair radiation.
"A very effective method of
removing sediment and particles
of foreign matter from the cool
ing system, is to till the radiator
with boiling water, in which
from three to five pounds of sal
soda has been dissolved. Allow
this solution to stand in the
radiator and water jackets
for twenty-four hours, after
which it should be drained off
and the system thoroughly
flushed out with clean water. If
this is done once a mooth, or at
least every 2,000 miles, it will
keep the radiator and water
jackets in very efficient condi
tion. "The fan should always be
kept in an efficient condition,
care being taken to see that the
belt is not slipping and that the
blades have not straightened
out, as in this case the fan will
not draw sufficient air through
the radiator to insure proper
cooling.
"Not less than seven per cent
of the power developed by the
cylinder is lost in overcoming
the friction of the piston, and it
is, therefore, necessary that the
cooling medium be kept at its
highest point of efficiency to
enable the lubricating oil to per
form its duty. Experience has
proved that oil made from West
ern asphalt-base crude maintains
lubricating efficiency at cylinder
heat better than oils made from
other crudes, thus aiding ma
terially in keeping the motor at
the proper operating tempera
ture." BIG RANCH DEAL.
One of the biggest ranch deals
closed in southern Arizona was
consummated the past few days
when Ben J. McKinney, pro
minent Cochise county ranch
man, sold his Yellowstone ranch
northwest of Willcox, to Deming
Isaacson, owner of the adjoining
ranch, for a consideration said to
be approximately $150,000.
The deal carried with it about
3500 head of cattle. The new
purchase gives Mr. Isaacson
control of most of the range
country up to the San Pedro and
makes him owner of one of the
largest holdings in southern
Arizona. Prospector.

The rapid growth of Chloride
is daily adding to the trials and
labors of the local postoffice.
Daily a long line of people stand
patiently for hours waiting their
turn at the window sometimes
long after 0 o'clock. As usual,
Uncle Sam is the last person to
take notice of crowded conditions
in his postoffice, and Chloride is
no exception to the rule. Scores
of people clamor for boxes with
the usual answer that none are
available. This works a hardship
on newly arrived business people
who, perforce, are compelled
to desert their business and
stand in line or wait until the
following morning. Miner.
Again I ask, what could the
people gain by returning the re
publican party to power?
With war disturbing commer
cial relations and affecting the
revenues of every country in the
world, do they want another job
of tariff tinkering, superintend
ed by "Boss" Penrose, of Penn
sylvania, who would be chair
man of the Senate Finance Com
mittee, and Joseph W. Fordney,
of Michigan, who would be
chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee?
Do they want to go back to
the discredited panic-breeding
banking and currency law of
unpleasant memory?.
Do they want the income tax
abolished?
Do they want to turn the Gov
ernment over in a time like this
to men who, fired by political
ambition, have viciously assail
ed Woodrow Wilson for a course
of conduct that has kept his
country out of the European
war?
Do they want "action" in Eu
rope, as many of these men have
demanded ?
Do they want to trust the des
tiny of this Republic to the men
whose utterances for a year aud
a half will bear no interpretation
but the interpretation of war.
Do they want to exchange
prosperity and peace for indus
trial uncertainty and the dang
ers of war?
In the coming election the
people will again stand by the
President. Forgetting their pol
itical differences and moved by
the patriotic sentiment, America
first and party afterwards, they
will endorse by an overwhelm
ing majority the man who, with
infinite patience, quiet courage
and masterly ability, and with
out the sacrifice of national hon
or, has successfully guided his'
country through storm and stress
and danger into the quiet harbor
of peace, safety, and prosperity.

tative Frank E. Doremus, chair

The Guggenheims have put
their stamp of approval on
Chloride by taking over the
Elkhart mine. For several
months their experts have been
on the ground making reports
and examinations with the result
afore stated. The tremendous
import of this action on the part
of the largest concern in the
world is at first glance hardly
appreciated. No amount of ad
vertising that Chloride could do
would reach the sources of
wealth that will be the result of
this transaction. The Guggen
heims are known as the most
conservative body of mining men
in the country and rarely enter
a new field w?ithout spending
large sums of money in getting
the highest paid expert advice
obtainable in the present day.
Their system of check and ro
check is of a character unequaled
and when at last they determine
to open a property it is done on
a huge scale for months and
production is undertaken.
Miner.
As was to be expected, the
jingo organs and especially
those which have heretofore
called themselves progressive
and are now under the painful
necessity of shouting for their
new masters, are filled with
criticism of the Wilson adminis
tration concerning its attitude
towards Mexico and the pos
sibility of war with that unhap
py country.
The papers that have come
back or that have been sandbag
ged back into the fold must,
perforce, demonstrate the sin
cerity of their conversion or
reversion by waving the bloody
shirt abroad and covering their
past slackness by their present
earnestness of effort.
They tell of the "awful"
negligence of the administration
in "not heeding the predictions
this journal made four year ago"
that the United States would
have to go to war with Mexico
and their one cry is for b 1 o o-d.
The people of the United
States are not to be deluded by
this noise. They remember that
neither Roosevel or Taft ever
protected an American in Mexico
or anywhere else. They should
remember that, under the ad
ministrations of both of these
fire eating patriots and Elijahs,
Americans in Mexico tound
safety in registering themselves
as Englishmen and as Germans
and in claiming the protection of
the consulates of those powers.
Under either Taft or Roosevelt
this nation would have been
largely helpless against a war
with Mexico until a reasonable
time for getting ready had elaps
ed. The army was disorganiz
ed, the navy was a joke when
Taft left the White House and'
they were in jut the same con
dition when Roosevelt handed
Lhc.n over to him.
Today, after the lapse of less
than four years, we have an ad
equate army on the Mexican
border, an army well equipped
and ready, if need shall arise,
for an immediate advance. Fif
ty thousand men wearing tho
uniform of the United States are
ready to do their duty, whatever
that duty may be, and to do it
efficiently. Under the "slack,
negligent and ineffective" ad
ministration of Woodrow Wilson,
the army and navy of the United
States are, for the first time in
decades, ready for service.

SOME CANTELOUPES.
A Tucson dispatch of recent
date says:
Trains laden with canteloupes
from the Imperial valley are
passing through Tucson at the
rate of from four to six per day.
They are bound for the big east
ern centers, where the Califor
nia melons enjoy a high reputa
tion among cafo and restaurant
caterers.
Thus far about forty trains
have passed through, each of
approximately 70 cars. As each
car contains something like 9,000
melons, a whole trainload would
contain 630,000 of the luscious
canteloupes. In forty trains
there would be approximately
25,200,000 melons.
If each meloQ measures five
inches in diameter, the melons
that have passed through would
if laid end to end reach a dis
tance of 126,000,000 inches or
105,000,000 feet, which is ap
proximately 2000 miles. If sold
for an average cf 10 cents each,
retail, the melons passing
through thus far would repre
sent a retail value of approxim
ately $2,500,000.
An examination of the quick
silver deposits of the Mazatzal
Range, Ariz., has been made by
F. L.. Ransome, of the United
States geological survey, and his
report has been published as
Bulletin 020 F. These quicksilver
deposits occur in a strip of coun
try about 6 miles long that ex
tends northestward across the
Mazatzal Range in the vicinity of
Pine Butte, 11 miles south of
North Peak. All the claims are
in the Sunflower mining district,
in which cinnabar was discover
ed in October, 1911, by E. H.
3owman, of Phoenix, while pros
pecting for gold.
