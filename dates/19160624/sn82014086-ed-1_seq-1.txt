San Antonio, Texas, June 23. The
two troopa of the Tenth Cavalry un
der Captain Charles T. Boyd, practi
cally were wiped out by the attack of
Mexican forces under General Gomez
at Carrizal June 21, according to
indications given In a fragmentary re
port received by General Funston from
General Pershing tonight. ;-. ,
Seven Survivors Return.
. General Pershing's message stated
that seven survivors in all, including
those who arrived last night, have
reached, the main column.- All were
enlisted men, but the report did not
say Whether there were non-commissioned
officers among them.
Charged at Conclusion of Parley.
According to the stories of the sur
vivors as outlined in General Persh
ing's report, a mounted force of Mexi
cans made a charge from the flank at
the conclusion of a parley between
Captain Boyd and General Gomez,' at
the same . time that a machine gun
opened fire from the front as General
Gomez reached hi lines. -

garrison of Carrizal, which had almost
surrounded the little American force
tinder cover of the parley sought by
General Gomez to discuss whether
- Captain Boyd should be allowed to
pass through the town, stampeded the
horses. No details were made known
to General Pershing as to whether the
Mexican charge was checked.
Ringed Around on Three Sides.
With their mounts gone, caught
without means of escape, ringed about
on three sides with the fire of an over
whelming force, the fate of the - little
'detachment is -believed by officers here
to have been sealed. It is feared that
only the most stupendous luck, backed
by desperate valoT, could have extri
cated Captain Boyd's , men from the
trap. .
' Reports from Mexican sources
placed the number 'of killed, includ
ing two officers, at from 12 to 40. It
Is reported that 17 were taken cap
tive into Chihuahua.
, Estimate of Casualties. "
The accepted percentage of wounded
to those killed in modern warfare
would place the wounded at from 35
to 40 at the lowest estimate. The
strength of the two troops, G and K,
Is not known here, but it is estimated
that they could not exceed 1Z0 men,
allowing for those sick and on de
tached serviced With only seven sur
vivors reiported as arriving at the
main column, the number of those ac
counted for at least speculatively is
pitifully small. ,
Stories Are Confused.
J The report from General Pershing
stated that the stories of the survi
vors were confused and did not con
form i nail details with the report
made by the first arrivals from the
battlefield. General Pershing reported
that there was a scene of wild con
fusion when the Mexicans opened fire
and their cavalry charged. The strag.
triers apparently were cut off -In an
effort of Captain Eoyd to extricate is
men from the Jaws of the trap which
was closing on his command, or fled
before the outcome of the battle could
be learned.
No Word From 11th Cavalry.
General Pershing, according to his
report, had received no word from
the two' battalions of the Eleventh
Cavalry which he had sent to rescue
the remnants of Captain Boyd's ex
pedltion. He stated that he had -taken
'no measures to support the squadrons
of the Eleventh.

HOUSE VOTES APPROVAL ?
OF PRESIDENTS ACTION
In Calling Upon the National Guard in
the Mexican Crisis. . '
Washington, June 23. Legislative
approval of President Wilson's use of
the national guard In the Mexican
crisis was voted almost unanimously
by the house today in adopting a res
olution declaring the existence of an
emergency and giving the president a
free hand to draft as federal soldiers
all guardsmen willing to take the re
quired oath. The senate is expected
to concur tomorrow; - - '
A million dollars would be appro
priated by the resolution to aid de
pendent families of the guardsmen so
drafted, distribution of the fund would
be left to the war department with
the restriction that no family .should
receive more than J50 a month.
Only two representatives, a socialist
and a democrat, voted against the
resolution. During the debate pre
ceding its adoption several republicans
attacked the administration's Mexican
policy and insisted that President Wil
son should have informed congress of
the emergency instead of expecting it
to act on its own initiative. - No one
attempted to deny, tiowever, that an
emergency had arisen nad Republican
Leader 'Mann, former Speaker Cannon
and others declared that in reality a
state of war existed.

that, on account of Internal disorders
and lack ot H-nb Kovrz-.taent, Mexico
is no longer entitled to the customary
cosnideration accorded by nations to
each other. But in view of the declar

tide was flowing at the rate of about
six miles per hour, with the crews,
while the- sky, mottled with gray
clouds, tempered the-rays of the sun
to botfi the oarsmen and the specta
tors-eyes. .
Observation Trains Were Filled,
The long observation trains which
followed the struggling: ' crews down
both sides of the Thames were filled
with the 'usual cheering and flag-waving
students, past and present, of the
two universities, ably reinforced by
hundreds of brilliantly gowned sisters,
daughters, mothers and wives, who
vied with each other in shouting en
couragement to ttoe eweep-swingers.
