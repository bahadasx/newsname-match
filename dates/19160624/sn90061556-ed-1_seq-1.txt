Wonderful Progress of a Race
What the American Negro Has Achieved in 50
Years Under the Most Trying and
Adverse Circumstances.
WILL BEBETTER FARTER ON.
The first African immigrants, twen
ty In number, landed in Virginia about
the last of August, 1619, coming over
in a Dutch man-ofwar. "They were
probably not slaves, but servants In
dentured for a term of years." (Ne
gro Year Book.)
In 1628 slavery began in New York
and New Jersey and gradually gained
ground in the other staates.
From twenty immigrants in 1619,
with the continual Importation of the
African slaves, the ' race grew in
strength and numbers until when the
emancipation proclamation was issueil
by the immortal and peerless Abra
ham Lincoln in 1963, tthe African con
tingent in this country had amassed
a population of 4,441,730. That same
race now numbers in its ranks over
11,000,000 Afrlcacn-Amerlcans.
It Is hardly necessary to recount the
African-American's deeds of heroism
and valor on the battle fields for this
country, dating from the revolution
ary war, when Cripus Attucks, an
African slave, was the first to shod
his blood for American independence.

From cards received from the "Bil

evident that scores of Colored men
"hit the trail" during his stay here.

keep apace.

Committee of Managers of the Paseo
Y. M. C. A., will make his home in
the Chicago building while in that city
this summer.
The Mexican situation, which calls
for the mobilization of the State Mi

Guard, as Is the case In Illinois. Mr.
Gaston Graham, who has made his
home temporarily in the Association
building, received this week orders
to report to his command, Company I
of the 8th Illinois regiment.
The second overnight hike of the
season was held last Saturday night
to North Kansas City. Tho site where
the boys stayed for tbo night was a
place from which we could get a long
distance view of our city that could
not bo duplicated from any other
point around Kansas City. The boys
are very anxious for their summer
camp to open. This year's camp will
be larger and even better than last
year's. We hope to accommodate 50
