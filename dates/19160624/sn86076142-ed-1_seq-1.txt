;: WASHINGTON, June 24. The United Slates and Mexico ore
on the verge of war as the result of the belief here that troops of
the Tenth Cavalry were massacred at Carrizal by Carranza soldiers,
who, under pretense of a parley, led the American soldiers into a
well laid trap.
At a conference between Secretaries Lansing and Baker and
President Wilson at the White House it was learned that the
possibility of drastic retaliatory action against the Mexican forces
in Chihuahua was given grave consideration.

If Carranza accepts the responsibility for the Carri.al attack
it is considered virtually certain by the officials that the occupation
of most of northern Mexico will be ordered by " the president as
rapidly as the necessary military forces can be placed at the
disposal of General Funston.
Action awaits further reports from General Pershing. A message
last night indicated that only seven men survived in addition to
those who are; prisoners.
It is believed the first act of the Washington government, when
fuller information is at hand, will be to demand reparation from
Carraiua.
