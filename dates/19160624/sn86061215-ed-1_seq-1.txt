STRAGGLERS TELL
OF ATTACK UPON
El
EARLY REPORT FROM PERSHING
IS THAT CARRIZAL FIGHT WAS
UNPROVOKED.
San Antonio, Tex., June 23.—Gen.
Funston awaited today further details
from Gen. Pershing of the Carrizal at
tack by a greatly superior force of
Mexicans under Gen. Felix Gomez on
Troops and of the tenth U. S.
cavalry under Capt. Charles Boyd.
Gen. Pershing's report, received at
headquarters last night, was based on
the stories of several stragglers, who
had made their way back to the main
column. They said the attack was
entirely unprovoked and was made af
ter the Mexican force had parti/
surrounded the Americans under cover
of a parley between Gen. Gomez and
Capt. Boyd. It was not until after
the Mexicans had opened fire with a
machine gun on the American troopers
that Capt. Boyd dismounted bis com
mand and returned the fire.
Conference Wanted.
The stragglers reported to Gen.
Pershing that the forces under Capt
Boyd and Capt. Lewis S. Morey Joined
at Oko, Santo Domingo, on June ^20,
and proceeded together toward Car
rizal, arriving within a mile of that
town at 7:30 a. m., on June 21. Capt.
Boyd, the senior commander, ordered
a halt at that point and sent a courier
into Carrizal, asking permission of
the Mexican commander to pass
through the town. This permission
was refused, according to the courier,
but while he was making his report a
messenger arrived from Gen. Gomez
with word that the American troops
would be allowed to pass through,
provided Capt. Boyd would stop within
the town for a parley.
Open With Machine Gun.
Before Capt Boyd had dispatched an
answer to this message, Gen. Gomez
himself rode out to meet .the Ameri
can commander, accompanied by staff
members. While they were talked, a
large number of the Mexican garrison
poured out of the town and began to
crowd toward the American forces
from all sides.
Capt. Boyd, according to the report,
protested emphatically against this
movement What reply Gen. Gomez
made Was not known by the returning
troopers but Gen. Gomez retired to
ward his own lines. The moment he
reached his men the Mexicans opeded
fire with a machine gun. Capt Boyd
Immediately dismounted his men, de
ployed them as skirmishers and re
turned the fire. There the story of
stragglers ends.

ped the Russian drive westward.
Along the Stokhod river in the region
of Sokul heavy fighting iB in progress
and the Russians claim that the Teu
tonic allies have been driven back,
while Berlin asserts that the Russians
have been forced to give wax. In Ga
licia the* Russians continue their ad
vance and have captured Radautz,
about thirty miles south of Czernowitz
taking more prisoners and guns.
Between the Pripet river marshes
and Riga the Germans have started
what seems to be a general offensive,
heavily bombarding Russian positions
or throwing infantry attacks against
them. The Russian official reports de

in this region have failed.
In the vicinity of Verdun the Ger
mans again are heavily bombarding
French positions, the attacks against
Hill 304 and Le Mort Homme, north
west of Verdun, and Thlamont, the
Vaux wood, being especially severe. In
counter attacks northeast of Verdun
the French have recaptured most of
the trenches taken by the Germans
Wednesday night.
Near Givenchy the Germans captur
ed British trenches but were later
driven out, suffering heavy losses.
In air battles recently the .Germans
have lost foyr aeroplanes and tho
French one.
No changes of importance have oc
curred on. the Austro-Italian front, or
in Asiatic Turkey.

VOLUME SIXTY-EIGHT OTTUMWA. WAPELLO COUNTY, IOWA SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1916 NUMBER
PERSHING CALLS ATTACK UNPROVOKE
CITIZENS BEGIN
ROYS IT THE FRONT
DEPENDENTS WHO ARE LEFT BE­
HIND PRESENT PROBLEM FOR
THE CITY TO SOLVE.
A movement has been launched for
the raising of a fund with which to
aid the members of Co. take care of
dependents they are leaving behind
them. The summons to duty has work
ed a hardship upon numerous members
of the company and some of them are
compelled to leave their wives and
children poorly provided for. Still
others have mothers or sisters who
are dependent to some extent. While
not begrudging service to the nation, it
is but natural that these certain mem
bers of the company are sick at heart
at the call to the colors.
Eleven members of the company—
other than the commissioned officers—
are married and fifteen members have
families or others dependent upon
them. So the call to arms is a calam
ity to more than a score of people,
many of whom are children.
Foreseeing such a state of affairs,
two Ottumwans, W. R. Daum and Sen
ator C. W. Whitmore have come for
ward to start a movement that will
take care of the dependents of those
who go to the front in the service of
the country. The one calls attention
to the i\eed and urges the people to
arise to the oocasion and stand not on
ly behind those who take up arms for
the country, but to take in a measuro
the place of the earners by providing
some help. The other inspired by the
same patriotic spirit has suggested
plan whereby the dependents on the
members of guard and band may be
aided during the absence of their
bread winners at the front.
The plan suggested by W. E. Daum
would provide a fund that will help to
make up in part for the decreased
earnings of the soldiers and music
ians, their army pay being decidedly
less than what they are able to earn in
civil life. Mr. Daum's letter including
the plan suggested for this purpose
follows:
Believing that the young men should
not be expected to make all the sacri
fices for our country, I am willing to
join with other citizens of Ottumwa
to provide a fund for the benefit of the
dependent relatives of members of
Company and of members of the
band if sent into Mexico or called upon
to defend our flag on the border, and
for this purpose, would agree to con
tribute $15 a month for one year or
"during the war."
The regular pay of a private in the
army Is but $15 a month which is a
mere pittance compared with what
these men could earn if they remained
at. home the pay of a non-commission
ed officer is but little more.
If say only one hundred and seventy
five of Ottumwa citizens would pledge
themselves to pay an average of $15 a
month each, there would be a monthly
income sufficient to pay an average of
$15 a month for each member of Com
pany (If recruited to full war
strength), and each member of the
band. In some cases it would not be
needed and more would therefore be
available in emergencies where urg
ently needed. However a much larger
sum should be pledged and many more
than 175 should join in the plan.
One of the banks could be mad*
trustee where the funds would draw
interest until required, a commission
appointed to handle the funds if any
part is left at the close of the war, let
It then be distributed among the fam
ilies of deceased soldiers and those in
capacitated by wounds or disease. If
these men risk their lives and Jiealth
and endure the hardships required, we
should be willing to relieve them and
those dependent upon them at least in
part of privations that would be due
to their decreased earnings.

With Little Change
Old Jupiter Pluvius who .often
causes rain checks to be issued for
baseball games, interfered with the
splendid arrangements that were made
by the committees of the Swedish
American league for the annual cele
bration of Midsummer day. A big
time was planned including a pleasing
program of speech, Bongs and games
at Caldwell park with a band concert
in the park this evening.
The heavy rain of early morning
made it Impossible to use the park for
the occasion and the opera house was
engaged in advance for Just such an
emergency. The failure to have the
celebration in the open is a disappoint
ment but despite the interference of
the rain, a big program has attracted
a large number of people to the Grand
this afternoon where at 3 o'clock the
festivities started.
The program at the opera house in
cluded most of the numbers that were
to be given at the park with the ex
ception of the band concert. And ad
dress by Mayor F. H. Carter opened
the speaking program and Herbert
Swanson. supply pastor at the Swedish
Lutheran church gave an address in
Swedish.' A solo by Ed Blake and
singing by a large chorus that has
been specially drilled for the celebra
tion were musical features. Twenty
four boys and girls gave a Swedish
weaving dance under the direction of
Miss Ada Linquist.
Reception for Eberhart.
Half a hundred Swedish-Americans
of Ottumwa gathered at the Ballingall
hotel this noon and tendered an In
formal reception to A. O. Eberhart of
St. Paul, former governor of Minne
sota and speaker of the day. Dinner
was served in the main dining room.
At a smaller table between two large
ones, half a dozen members of Co.
sat as special guests of the occasion.
All the guardsmen were of Swedish
American descent.
Oscar A. Anderson acted as toast
master at a short after dinner pro
gram. He extended a welcome to Gov.
Eberhart and then called upon several
of those present for short talks, pre
liminary to the governor's talk
H. G. Anderson had Ottumwa for
his subject and he briefly outlined the
progress that this city has made in
the past few years and painted its fu
ture in bright colors.
John C. Ranseen, formerly of this
city but for the past twenty-five years
a resident of Minnisota, gave a five
minute talk on Minnesota and its agri
cultural accomplishments.
R. D. MacManus paid tribute to
Swedish-Americans anjd pointed to the
guardsmen as evidence enough of loy
alty to America and its institutions.

.Gov. Eberhart was then introduced.
He expressed his pleasure at being in
Iowa and then launched into the sub
ject of hyphenated Americanism.
"The hyphen," he said, "has been
getting some very undesirable notor
iety. It seems to me that it has re
ceived needless prominence. The hy
phen can mean only one of two things
it. refers either to ancestry or to divid
ed allegiance.
"In our America the hyphen is useful
only in showing ancestry. Swedish
Americans are American citizens of
Swedish descent. There is no other
meaning to be taken from the term.
There is no divided allegiance among
the Americans of Scandinavian de
scent."
The governor then took up the re
quirements of American citizenship
and In the course of his talk defined
an American as one possessing "the
genius and patriotism of the Yankee,
the wit and humor of the Irish, the
sturdy 'man Is a man for a' that' spirit
of the Scot, the determination of the
English, the polish and bravery of the
French, the plodding spirit of the Rus
sian, the thrift of the Jew, the effi
ciency and thoroughness of the Ger
man and laBtly the honesty and indus
try of the Scandinavian."
Mr. Eberhart lauded the mid-siimmer
day of the Swedish-Americans as an
added opportunity to reaffirm allegi
ance to the United States, "that one
place where the boy has a chance in
life with the best, be he rich or poor,
regardless of where he was born or
whether he has along line of ancestry
to point to."
He closed with an appropriate .'quota
tion on the value of "a friend or two."

day was without official instructions
from Washington directing that as
aoon as 6,000 state troops had been
mustered into federal Bervice they
were to be sent to the border but was

Camp of Illinois Guardsmen Not The
Hilarious Place It Was During
Afinual Encampments.
Springfield, 111., June 23. —The trag
edies of war are already being felt and
seen here. Nowhere in or about Spring
field is the seriousness of the Mexican
situation so poignantly reflected as at
Camp Lincoln. There is no horse play,
no hilarity, no infractions of camp law
such as is'frequently observed at an
nual encampments of state militia.
Women visitors are as numerous in
this caihp as at any gathering of uni
formed soldiers, but they area serious
looking lot of women—wives, mothers
and sweethearts saying goodbye to
their boys and men. In their faces one
can see that both the men and women
realize it may be the last goodbye.
Every train from Chicago brings doz
ens of women who have come to' be
near their menfolk until the order to
move south is given.
MEXICANS TRY TO

the Mexican government that war with
the United States was inevitable on
account of the methods employed by
the American government and pointed
out that all the 'republics of Central
and South America would be affected
by a conflict.
The Peruvian government returned
a carefully worded reply, couched in
friendly terms expressing the hope
that peace would be maintained.

Des Moines looking after the troop
movements that are to be handled hy

Preparation for the removal of thS
Ottumwa guardsmen to Camp Dodge
have been underway by the Burlington
and Thursday orders were received to
have three coaches and a baggage csr
in readiness at Ottumwa for the trans
portation of Co. to Des Moines to
day. The change in the time for leav
ing is believed to be due to the taet
that two companies of the Third la*
fantry, Villisca and Winterset troops,
have not been recruited to their fidl
I peace strength. The instructions giv
en by Mr. Reno to the local officials
regarding the movement iof the local

Creston Takes Men*
The Burlington road will be hit hard
in the mobilization of troops from a
number of the places along the lino
because of the number of the road's
