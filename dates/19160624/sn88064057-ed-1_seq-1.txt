A Wholesome
Vegetable
The lima or butter bean is
a vegetable that should re
ceive more consideration and
attentior in this section than
it now gets. It is not only a
wholesome vegetable to use
in.the fresh or green state,
but can be dried and kept
through the winter and sold
in the local markEtts.
The bush type of lima beans
should receive ulore attention;
they are easily grown, and if
given proper care and atten
--ion--will continue to bear
throughout the season. They
should, however, be as liberal
ly fertilized as any other gar
den vegetable. The bash limas
c in be planted as early as the
bush or snap beans (about
March 20 to April 5), are
quite hardy, and will begin to
mature their crop by the first
of July under favorable con
ditions and good culture.
They should be grown in rows
three feet apart and the plants
left about twelve inches in the
row. Good cultivation is giv
en throughout the season, and
the dry beans picked off from
time to time, or else the vines
will cease to bear.
Do not plant large limas
from the North in the South.
They will not succeed here.--

Louisiana club boys are en
couraged to construct wooden
or concrete wallows for their
pigs, and to keep iiheim in rea
sonablv clean co<,difi+a. The
cut shows a boarded-up wal
low made by a pig-club boy.
It is very satisfactory; but a
better way is to dig a shallow
hale, big enough for the pigs
to lie in, and to use concrete
for the sides and bottom, plas.
tering right unto the earth. It
is a good plan, also, to put in
a drain so that the water may
be readily changed.
In addition to making the
hogs more comfortable these
wallows can be used as a means
of ridding them of lice and
fleas. To do this, eover the

When the pigs go into the

At the war, navy and state depart

had come to precipitate the new or

Wire service into Mexico has been
cut on the Mexican side at a number
of border points.
Within the last two weeks, however,
tension has been increasing steadily.
The crisis presented by General Car
ranza's note demanding the recall of
Brigadier General Pershing's expedi
tionary force has been followed by a
virtual ultimatum served on the Amers
lean officer by General Trevino, the
Mexican commander in Chihuahua.
To this was added the possibility that
American and Mexican troops had
clashed across the border from San
Benito, Texas.

Cotton is still
Largest Cash Crop
Since the advent of the
Mexican boll wevill in Louisi
ana, it has been quite the fash
ion to scoff at cotton and to ri
dicule its production. People
have heard so much of the des
truction of Louisiana's cotton
crop by the wevil until they
imagine that it is no longer
of commercial importance in
the state. In spite of the wevil
damage and the reduction of
the cotton acreage caused by
it, cotton is still the largest
cash crop in the state. The
average value of the sugar
cane crop of the state from
1909 to 1915(1910 excepted)
is $16,019,825,00: the aver
age value of rice for the sameL
period is $ 9,944,00o.00; and
for the cot:on crop--seed and
lint--covering the same years
which include all the years (if
heavy wevil damage, the aver
agevalue is $23,302,714.00.
While the corn crop, for this
period, had the largest farm
value of any other, yet only
a small percentage of the corn
moves tomarket as a cash crop
The average value of the corn
crop for th se same period is
$25,211,428. These figures
are taken from the report of
the United States Department
of Agriculture. The 1915 fig
ures are preliminar --c t .o
