LIEUT. SAMUEL A. MCGOWAN, HAS BEEN COMMISSIONED AS THE
REGULAR CORRESPONDENT OF THIS PUBLICATION AND ITS
MANY READERS CAN KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE MOVEMENTS
AND DOINGS OF THE EIGHTH REGIMENT ILLINOIS NATIONAL
GUARDS UNTIL THE WAR WTH MEXICO COMES TO AN END.
Many people in all parts of this
country for the past two or three years
have been engaged in severely con
demning President Woodrow Wilson,
for adhering to his "Watchful Wait
ing policy' while dealing with the
Mexican situation and without the
slightest warning last Monday morn
ing ho startled the entire world by
issuing an order through the secretary
of war calling on the governors of
many of the states to order the Na
tional Guards to mobilize at certain
well located points and as rapidly as
possible make all preparations to in
vade Mexico, in order to protect the
lines of American citizens who have
in J ho past and at the present time
aro being slain in the border warfare,
and the latest news is to the effect
that I'D to :50 members of the jlth
and loth Cavalry have been killed
by the Mexicans within the last two
or throe days, it may be that in the
past that some of the Americans who
have boon determined to control that
toimlry and rule the Mexicans with
in iron hand the same as they wan
tonly in a brazen faced manner ride
rough shod over the civil and the
political rights of the darker and the
weaker races in this country and in
other sections of the world are largely
responsible for the present disordered
state of affairs in Mexico, but brush
ing all of that aside for the present,
one thing is certain that peace and
order should at once be established in
that country and its governmental af
fairs should be in the hands of safe
and sound rulers or representatives
if the more advanced and civilized
iloxicans and the Americans who have
forgo landed interests, and are greatly
interested in other enterprises in that
country should be severely taught to
at all times to respect all the rights
f that class of the Mexicans.
The First Cavalry, the First Regi
ment, Col. J. b. Sanborn, Command
os, the Second Regiment, Col. John
J- Garrity, Commanding, the fighting
Seventh Regiment, Col. Daniel Mor
,arty, Commanding of the Illinois Na
tional Guards are all now quartered at
Camp Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois the
Seventh departing Thursday night
That same evening at 12:45 o'clock
the Eighth Regiment, Col. Franklin
A. Denison, Commanding, with its
famous band well in the lead Capt.
William Berry in charge of it wended
its way through the streets on its way
to the Illinois Central depot and de
parted over that road for Camp Dunne
at Springfield, Illinois, even at that
late hour of the night thousands and
thousands of both White and Colored
people lined the streets on both sides
to witness its departure and many of
the women were in tears at beholding
their loved marching away as though
their lives would be ended on the bat
tle fields of Mexico.
It was indeed an inspiring sight to
see Franklin A. Denison, the bright
little seven year old son of Col. and
tant; 1st Lieut Harry W. Jones, B'n
Adjutant; 1st Lieut Clement N. Hin
ton, B'n Adjutant
As further evidence that the war
spirit continues to run strong among
the great majority of the Colored peo
ple. Just as soon as it became ap
parent that the Eighth Regiment had
been ordered to Camp Dunne, the
members of the Berean Baptist Church
52nd and Dearborn streets, met and
cheerfully and willingly granted their
pastor the Rev. W. S. Braddan, six
months vacation with full pay for each
and every month as he is the eloquent
Chaplain of the Eighth Regiment,
showing that they are true blue Amer
icans and that they are more than
willing to have their pastor to nobly
perform his part in connection with
the war against the Mexicans.
For some time to come Lieut Sam

regular correspondent for this pub

COL. FRANKLIN A. DENISON, COMMANDING THE EIGHTH REGTMENT
ILLINOIS NATIONAL GUARDS.
MISS KATHRYN RUTHERF O RD
WHO WORKED VERY HARD FOR
THE ELECTION OF MAYOR WDL
LIAM HALE THOMPSON IN" 1915,
WELL ORGANIZE A VOLUNTEER
REGIMENT COMPOSED ENTIRE
LY OF SOUND ABLE BODIED
MEN.
Miss Kathryn Rutherford, 121 East
43rd St, who springs from one of the
oldest families in this city, who is a
keen student of political events, who
worked very hard for the Hon. William
Hale Thompson, for Mayor of Chicago
In 1915, delivering many speeches in
favor of his election in all parts of
this city, who lead the cheering In
the late Republican National Conven
tion in favor of the nomination of
Col. Theodore Roosevelt, she attract
ing more attention than any of his
many admirers, is at the present time
laying her plans to organize a vol
unteer regiment which will be com
posed entirely of sound able bodied
men.
Miss Rutherford will not do any
of the commanding herself and she
will permit the rank and file of her
volunteer regiment to select the vari
ous officers whom they want to lead
her forces into Mexico.
WAR FOR HEALTH.
In England, on account of the war,
it is reported that local health author
ities are finding it difficult to properly
and promptly collect and dispose of
refuse of a fly breeding nature. Un
less householders co-operate by burn
ing this stuff or burying it, flies will
greatly increase and add to their do
mestic troubles, because of the un
usual demand for men at the front
We in America, notably in big cities
have no excuse for not fighting this
greatest enemy to domestic peace and
health the fly. Some people say they
do not believe in America's taxing to
maintain a large army or navy. Some
say they do not want to prepare to
kill human" beings by fostering military
training and thought s-
But whether militarists or "pacifists,
in the ordinary sense, we must all
agree on one thing. Patriotism, love
of life, love of health, love or comfort,
all admonish us to camp on the job
of fly extermination. Drill and train
daily in the manual which covers care
ful supervision of wet rubbish, gar
bage and refuse inviting fly invasion.
Have you a good garbage can?
Has it a cover?
Does the cover fit?
Is the cover kept in place?
Does your servant put all garbage
in the can?
Does the garbage wagon call regu
larly? Does it call often enough to prevent
over-accumulation?
If not, call up the Department of
Health, or Department of Streets &
Alley Cleaning and report the matter.
Is there any accumulation of damp
vegetable or animal matter about your
place or on neighboring premises?
Do you or your neighbors keep
chickens, horses or cows? If so, is
proper disposal made of all manure,
so that no flies find a breeding place?
This is a war worth while. It is
a war which is no hell; but an in
ferno of insanitation awaits us if we
hesitate and refuse the call to volun
teer. Enlist at once! Fall in! Right dress!
Attention!
Shoulder arms!
Ready! Aim! Fire the fly!
Six states and twenty cities are an

bringing in a revenue for anti-tuberculosis
work in the United States of
$800,000.
How would you like to live in a
town or a community where the peo
ple had no public health service, no
education or instruction in matters of
sanitation and no efforts made to pre
vent needless disease and death In a
town, so unfortunately situated, you
would find people who still believo
that night air is dangerous and that
flies are needed as scavengers to eat
up neighborhood filth and thus keep
people well.
