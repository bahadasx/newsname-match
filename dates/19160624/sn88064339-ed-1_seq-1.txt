FAT ING HOGS
IN LOUISANA
With the rapidly iLll.rcreusig nIns etr
of Pgom hogs b. tug raisetd in lAnI,i4ltaia
and a btwtter applrcy'ialctil o it Io he' psl

for both the grow ing and fattening of
hogs which ,ne.-ts the needs peculiar
Th. h ohld touethewl of letting the holl s
runi wild on the openl range, eking cots
a prec'arilts existence for the nuiost
part, and fattening on acoil rns, iech
mast. eta.. has beavn very largely abanH
doneld, and a systel of lclt ivattede crops
is plannetd in such a way as to piro ide,
grazing all through the grow ing pIritod
and an abutlndane of faillnti Ing ialterial
avaliable % hen needed Noni' have
attempted to foliow lthe plan lof tPlenllintU
the hogs and carrytngltheir fooId to
them This method aytil) result in very
early maturity and large gaii, but Ilhi'
eost of both food and labor is too great
for profitable returns.
The plan res.omllmend.ed by the Stat.e
lxpelriment Station, ansd which is being
qutlite gientrally adopted, is to grazse the
growing pll oan toats and clovers dur
ing the intter and spring, changing to
Blerinud grass as the summer ad.
vasnes. I)uring this timle only a smlall
amount of grann is given, the Id.ea
being to carry the pigs along as cheap
ly as possible, while at the same time
tmaking a fair rate of growth.
The fatltening period starts with early
corn and peas, which are ready to
grase about July 15 Ioth lthe fall and f
spring litters are turned into the fields,
the young pigs picking up most of the
grain which the larger hlgs would
otherwise waste. This crop a111 carry
the pigs until about tieptembr 1, w hen
the soy beens or peanuts are ready for
grif-ing. As before, the smaller pigs
will ptok up the sceattering grain aod
make rapid gains. As both soy beans
and peanuts are low In carbobydrates
and very rich in protein, corn is fed in
connection to balance the ration. The
pigs grase this crop until about No
vember 1, when sweet potatoes are
ready. The fali pigs, those born the
previous fall, will now be nearly ready
for market, and may be penned and
anlibed oa corn and cotton-seed meal.
or may be allowed to grase on the po
tatoes with the younger hogs. The
lar-est pins per acre are always made
with sweet potatoes, but the resulting
fat is soft and oily. To offset this, as
well as to secure better returns from
the sweet potatoes, one pound each of
corn and cottonseed meal per head is
fe daily. After graling the potatoes
for about six weeks, the pigs will
usually be nearly ready for market.
and are usually penned and finished
with corn and eattontaeed meal. If any
potatoes are left in the . eld, they are
ltherend by brood mows and young pis.
It will be noted that the hogs are
made to ptiher practliclly all of their
food. This not only saves a gIreat deal
of tabor, bet by actuall experlece,
proves to be an economical pranctiCe,.
the hoga makling from one-third to one
fourth greater ganls per arre when
allowed to grase the crops than they
would make were they confitned and
the food brought to thenm. This differ
elne is due to the fact that they eat a
large amount of the stems and leaves
of the peas, soy tweans and peranuts,.
whhob mare rich in prtlein, to say
notlhing of the gralln and the rowpeas.

CmtOPS THAT MAY /E PLANTED IN
JUNE AND JULY.
tnpanlsh peanuts, soy beans. (ermnlan
millet. sorghum, and cow prea are
among the erops that may be' planted
and satisfactory returns expected,
Spanlsh peanuts may be planted up
to the lst of July and make a good
crop. They are espelally desirable
where hogs can be allowed to harvest
them.
Kay btans, preferably the Mammoth
Yellow, may be planted any time from
Jnne to the latter part of July and
ttillied for foraget or for a grain crop.
They should he planted In rows as
close together as cultivation will per
mit and cultivated two or three times.
Most soils are naturally Inoculated for
soy beWans. It may take' a little' more
if the rows are le.s than thre'e feet
apart, or a little least if the rows are
more than three feet apart. They
shaold be drtilled so that the stalks
will e ttwo to four inches apart in the
drill
Probably the eatch crop that re
qulires le'ss timne for maturity is ;e'ran
millet. Harvest may ei' made ordi
narily in sixty to sixty-fve days from
time of planting. The quality of hay
Is fairly good if cut tefore' the' seed
are fully mature, and the yield is good
on good land, but the draft on the soill
Is pretty heavy.
Almost any of the sorlthums may he'
planted up to the Iot of July. and vae
rleties such as the Kparly Amber. Early
Orange and (loleman may be planted
eonaliderably later. When planted Ln
mid-summer they will approilmately

ONEIN CT LETIl
One cent letter postage is attracting
the attention of Congress, 5o bills caill
lag for the Inauguration of a onut cent
rate on local delivery letters having
bIten introduced.
Mlany newspapers throughout the
country are warmly advoratnll the
lower rate, and the inauguratior n of a
iecalled "'one" systeml for the trasis
portation of periodical literature of all
kinds At the present time the great
bulk of smail being carried distances
under econdelass rates is furnished
by the magaItlle publishers of the large
eastern cities. Train load after train
load of magasines are sent out to all
parts of the country at a cost of one
cent a pound, although it has btwe
estimated by postal experts that it
costs over eight cents a pound to de
liver such literature
This, it is claimed, Is manifestly un
fair to the publishers of newspapers In
local territories, who are required to
pay the same rate for transportation
of their products It in proposed, and
will become part of the readjustment
of postage rates when such are made,
that a sone system be established anso
that a certain rate shall be charged for
all rlassas of publication for the rst
fifty miles. another for f0 to 160 milesn.
another for 1IO to 300 miles, and so up
to a haul which would extend across
the continent. Ia this way the pub'
lishers of big magazines would be
resuire'd to pay the government what
it actually coats to transport their
prodict
Under the present rate the United
States mails transport such magaslnes
as lasIle's an average of 1000 miles at
the same rate they would charge a
newspaper for the average haul of fifty
milel. Thla means a large subsidy for
Leslle's Weekly, amounting to about
$400,000 per annum. Some of the other
magzliae., having a much larger cir
culatlon, benefit to a much greater
degree. When It Is considered that
Leslie's Weekly charges over $1300 per
page per slnlgle lssue for its advertis
Ing space, and that onehalf or more
of the periodical is taken up with ad
vertlling, It hardly seems fair to usera
of letter postage and to newspaper
publishers that they should pay the
government a profit of t00%, when
nons of is used to defray general
expenses of the department, but groes
instead to take care of the deficit
created by the lossm Incurred in dis
tributing these magasines at one cent
a pound. a rate which is almost a
franking privilege.
Newspapers which eshould properly
represent the territory in which they
are published, and carry the advertise
ments of the nationally advertised
productsl in their terlritories are seldom
_-nsidered nowadays in the diltribes
titn of big advertisang appropriations.
The money goes rather to hupe mans
sine corporations which are growlnlg
fabllously rich. and which pay only a
fraction of the cost to the government
for the servlce, furnlshed them.
The reason one large magalane Inal
ne is paylng proflta may be noted in
the case of three trade publications
contrlled by it. The acitual value of
these phublication isn about $2,noIHI.

seco- clias rate and the resultlant In

recently sold for $1,100.,000. It is de

they paid a stock divlidend of 6t'l
When it is realised that the publish
