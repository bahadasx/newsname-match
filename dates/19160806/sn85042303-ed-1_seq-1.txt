ROBINS' STATEMENT
WILL SUPPORT HUGHES
Chicago, Aug. S. Raymond Robins,
chairman of the progressive national
convention and candidate of the Illi
nois progressives for I'nitetl States
senator In mil, announced today that
he would support Charles Kvans
Hughes, republican nominee for pru
dent, declared that it was "manifest"
that the progressive party was dead,
and asserted that "wise and sincere
progressives" fhould Join with repub
licans in the "common struggle for
social and Industrial Justice in city,
state, und nation."
In the statement which was address
ed to the progressives of the country,
Mr. Robins said:
"We progressives stand at the cross
roads, American social, industrial and
political life has broken down under
the old individualistic control. A new
national mind and conscience develop
ing sodal unity. Industrial standardi
zation, efficient political honesty;
from a self controlled democracy-this
is the rod of our cen, ration in Amcr-
ican life. I believe in the character
and courage of the nominee of the
repuliiiian party. He Is the most con
spicuous example In our hM-.ry of the
possibilities that American polities
may ln-ld for sueccsj in hbl" and un
selfish public service. For myself I
gladly enlist with the great majority

"The supreme need in American po
litical life is leadership supported by
a voting rank and file that will organ

industrial and military preparedness,
together with a comprehensive foreign
policy." the statement said.
"Can these imperative national
needs bo worked out by a states rights
democratic party that plans a state
dominated militia with its menace of
shiftless Incompetence spoils politics
and organizes snobbery In a national
defense force at a time of world peril.
"Comprehending our national neces
sities, how can progressives hesitate
long to choose between the party of
nationalism and the party of section
alism? Should not wise and sincere
progressives go en masse into the re
publican primaries, and fighting shoul

common struggle for social and indus

If this is generally dor", we can con
tinue to work together and bring back
a chastened republican party to its
ancient faith in human rights and na
tional integrity."
Reviewing the party history the
st;ifimuit said:
"In the 1914 and 1916 primaries the
progressive voters of 1912 deliberate
ly and In overwhelming numbers aban
doned the progressive party. The re
fusal of the progressive national com
mittee to favor a third ticket candi
dacy did no more than to make final
the Judgment entered by the progress
ive voters themselves. When the pro
gressive convention had adjourned nnd
the entire situation was considered
it was manifest that the end which
the voters had decreed had come that
the progressive party w-as dead."
