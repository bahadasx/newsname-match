LONDON, August 5.?Sanguinary
battles are raging tonight
at two points along the
western front in France, one in
the region of Pozieres, where the
forces under Gen. Haig have
pushed forward over a front of
several thousand yards, and the

where counter attack after
counter attack is being- launched
by the crown prince's armies, in
an effort to regain the village of
Fleury and the famous Thiaumont
work, both of which are
held by tiie French and around
which some of the fiercest fighting
of the war has been going
on during the past three or four
days.
The British advance to the north of
Posieres is the culmination of an endeavor
to straighten out their line between
this point and Thiepval. The attack,
which was made by Australians
and troops of the new Kitchener army,
reaulted also in the taking of several
hundred prisoners. German counter
attacks against the newly won positions
were repulsed with heavy losses,
London asserts.
Further than stating- that a new
battle was developing near Pozieres,
Berlin makes no mention of the latest
British advance. British attacks, however.
against the sectors from north
of Ovillers to Foureaux wood were repulsed
by the Germans. On the French
front in the Somme region, Paris says
there has been only little activity,
while Berlin claims the repulse of a
French advance south of Maurepas.
French Official Beport.
The French official communication issued
by the war office tonight reads:
"On the right bank of the Meuse the
enemy made no attempt in the sector j
o' Thiaumont. We have organized the j
positions conquered immediately west j
oI th? road from Thiaumont to Fleury j
1TI me mo cmno ovuliiciu ;

"After a violent bombardment, which
l;.s?ed the entire day, the Germans
Taunched two powerful attacks in the
Yaux-!e-Chapitre wood. One of these
a ttacks, broken by our fire, was not
; b!e to reach our lines. The enemy.

"The usual cannonade occurred on the
rest of the front.

"Aviation: The German aeroplane
which fell near Moranville. and was reported
in the communication of this
morning:, was brought down by Sergt.
Lenoir. This is the sixth enemy aeroplane
accounted for thus far by this
pilot."
Belgian communication: "Our batteries
of all calibers successful.y shelled
today the German works in the region of
Luxmude. The enemy replied feebly."
British Communication.
The British communication after
heralding the gain at Pozierea describes
fighting at other points as follows:
"Our artillery shelled La Courcelette
and Miraument, causing large explosions
In both places. Ten gun emplacements
and three ammunition stores were de
stroyed. The enemy attempted to seize
a crater near Souchez, but was repulsed
with bombs.
"There was some artillery activity
between Hooge and St. Eloi, where the
enemy exploded a small mine, but no
movement followed.
"The enemy's aircraft showed little
enterprise. Eight of their machines
scattered when engaged by three of
ours."
Check for ritish Claimed.
The text of the German statement
follows:
"According to supplementary reports,
battles north of the Somme, which we
reported yesterday, took place on an
extended front and against strong
British forces. At the end of the day
fighting was still in progress at some
points. British troops advancing in the
sectors stretching from north of Ovillers
to Foureaux were repulsed with
heavy losses at certain points after
subborn hand-to-hand fighting New
battles developed today near Pozieres.
A partial advance by the French
south of Maurepas during the afternoon
was repulsed.
"In the Aisne region th* enemy carried
out numerous patrol operations,
which were everywhere without result.
"On the right bank of the Meuse

to four different divisions, were
captured during our counter attacks

LONDON, August 5.?The Turkish attack
on the British positions in Egypt
to the east of the Suez canal comes as g
no surprise to those who are in close j
touch with the operations in that part 0
of the world. Gen. Sir Archibald Mur- s
ray, who commands the British army 0
there, has long realized that the Turks j
with the assistance of the Austrians r
and Germans might make a serious attempt
on the canal even at the the hot- r
test period of the year. ,
Austrian and German engineers for
many months have been digging for s
water, which, close to the Mediter- d
ranean coast, exists in many cases at .
no considerable depth under the sand,
although it mostly is too brackish for o
use of European troops. The Turks n
must, therefore, have made very thorough
arrangements for the storage v
and transport of water, the country r
being a pure sand desert, with small, ^
widely scattered oases of date palm
growing around ancient wells. i:
o
Long- Transport for Water.
At Romani, where fighting is in 1
progress, the Turks must bring up p
every drop of water from Aughratina,
some ten miles away. ^
It is understood that the Turks have *
with them some 1,000 to 2,000 Austror.prman
i*fantrv. as well as a large
number of Bedouin irregular horse.

Further reverses for the Russian j

in the Turkish war office etatement t
under date of August 4, which follows: ?
"Irak front: One of our volunteer de- <j
tachments inflicted losses on a weak
hostile detachment and captured horses v
and cattle. ?
"July 29, in a battle near Bukan, 11
Persia, the Russians were compelled to
retreat northward, abandoning 200 a

"Caucasus front: The situation in the

ROBINS BRINGS JOY

Express Confidence That Illinois
Will Koll Up Huge Plurality
for Their Candidate.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO. August 6.?There Is
;reat rejoicing: among: republican
eaders here over the announcement
>f Raymond Robins of his intention to
upport Hughes. Mr. Robins was one
f the guiding spirits of the recent
irogressive national convention and
aade the keynote speech.
His action today is regarded by the
epublican managers here as putting
he finishing touches to the progresive
party in Illinois, if such were, inleed,
needed, and as worth many
housands of votes to Hughes in
ither states, on account of his promilence
in the progressive party when it
vas alive and his influence with the
ank and file. The democrats made
lesperate efforts to keep him from gong
over to the republicans, but without
avail.
"The Robins statement," said a remblican
leader tonight, "will be the
nost effective welcome Chicago can
rive Mr. Hughes next week."
National Chairman Willcox is to meet
group of middle west republicans
iere for a conference Monday and
tart the campaign in this section.
Big Hughes Pluraltiy Predicted.
Illinois promises to be one of the
anner republican states in the naional
elections this fall and the reublican
leaders, entirely confident of
ictory, are now talking of trying to
un up a plurality of 300,000 for Mr.
lughes. They hope that the rising
ide of republican sentiment which
hey say has set in will sweep their
tate ticket into power and regain
everal congressional districts from
emocratic control.
These are the main grounds upon
rhich the republicans base their claims
f a substantial victory* at the polls
ti November:
First, reunion of the progressive
nd regular republicans which it is
laimed commenced two years ago
nd now is 90 per cent complete.
Second, dissatisfaction with the administration's
handling of internation1
affairs.
Third, opposition of the farmers to
he democratic tariff policies, from
rhich they suffered before the war and
rhich they apprehend will hurt again
fter the war.
The second of these considerations
3 more prominent than the others here
n Chicago, and will be treated first,
t is stated upon reliable republican
uthority that careful investigation deelops
that President Wilson's foreign
lolicies have not pleased any of the
oreign-born voters of this region.
All Criticise Mr. Wilson.
In the Chicago voting population
wenty-one foreign nationalities are
epresented and they all have newspaers.
The Star's correspondent is inorrned
upon authority whichcommands
redabillty that President Wilson is
nder criticism from all these nationlities.
The democrats have not suceeded
in pleasing any of them and
irge numbers of recruits are counted
,pon for the republican ticket from
ven the nationalities which supported
he democrats hitherto.
The'German vote is expected to be
olidly republican, and it is claimed
hat the Catholic Germans, who usually
re democrats here, as they are in Misouri,
are lining up for the republican
andidates. I am told of an incident in
his connection which occurred this
reek, and is regarded as a straw. The
emocratic managers went to a German
rho leads his district, a democrat, and
ffered him a place on the county
icket.
"Leave me off this year," he said;
this is a Hughes year."
He went on to say that a Sunday or
wo ago his church bund had a picnic
nd, upon politics being broached among
he men, a straw vote was taken, when
iwti> nut t, f Ki vtv.tu'ft r.f fho mtrnhnrB
ieclared for Hughes. Information is
hat this situation prevails extensively
hroughout the German societies.
The third' ground of satisfaction of
he republicans is found in the attiude
of the down-state farmers. Careul
inquiries have been made in the
.ast ten days among the agriculturists
.nd a number of important reports
arne in today, just in time to be utilized
n this dispatch.
Farmers' Sentiment Summarized.
Summarized, they set forth that the
arming communities are strongly
epublican. Dissatisfaction with the
idministration's forign policies is found
here as well as in Chicago. Credit is
fiven for the legislation of Congress
iesigned to aid the farmers, but it is
explained that it hasn't gone into pracical
effect to a degree to arouse universal
enthusiasm.
The farmers, it is declared, have not
orgotten that the democratic tariff legslation
was in effect long enough be'ore
the war to give them a taste of
ts operation, and it was a practical
ixample readily understandable. Foreign
raised corn and oats were on sale
n the state of Illinois, the home of
:orn, and the farmers' prices were lowered.
The tariff which permitted that
state of affairs is still on the statute
>ooks, and the men who grow the crops,
t is said, know that as soon as the war
n fiat ion subsides they will meet the
same conditions they encountered be'ore.
The republicans have discovered that
n the cities there is dissatisfaction
imong the salaried classes. They have
lot received increases in incomes and
lave been grievously disappointed over
he non-fulfillment of democratic promses
to lower the cost of living. They
rr tauui i.>e fiCUl ii?
setter* wages than ever before, and
farmers benefiting from the war-inluted
prices, while their own outgo is
increased and their income stationary;
Tieanwhile the democrats double the income
tax on such as are taxable.
Reunion Believed Complete.
Coming now to the first mentioned consideration,
the reunion of the progressives
and republicans, it is certainly a fact
accomplished in this state. As stated, it
has been in progress of accomplishment
for some time and the fruition Is here. It
was noted at the Indianapolis conference
of progressives that there was not a proA
/
il ' /
I #
AFTER SEVE
gressive In Illinois Interested enough ir
the future of the party to pay his railroad
fare on a five-hour journey to discuss
it. There are no progressive candidates
for nomination for governor oi
other state officers at next month's pri
maries. Another significant fact is thai
there are a great many more contestants
for republican nominations than for democratic
nominations, which is construec
as admission that republican chances are
brighter.
For instance, there are nine aspirant!
for the republican nomination for representative-at-large
in Congress and bui
four democratic. Much the same ratic
applies to desirable state offices.
Figures of Last Election.
The importance of the progressive-republican
reunion is appreciated by s
glance at the figures of the last nationa
election. President Wilson received 405,048
votes in Illinois, while the combinec
Taft and Roosevelt vote was 235,043 ir
excess of that figure, Roosevelt getting
386,478 and Taft 253,613.
Religion, it is cleamed, will cut a figure
in the election in the state south of Chicago,
and, it is alleged, to the detrimeni
of the democratic state ticket.

ibout this war are fully known, es

origins go back to the dimmest day
if border legend.
France Wants Saar Valley.
It must be remembered that France
lardened by Verdun, is now not onl:
nflexible for the retrocession of Alsae*
:nd Lorraine, but for the acquisitioi
>f the Saar valley Just over her presen
rontier. The Saar valley is a smal
Lrea within valuable coal districts
These added to the famous iron de

i, brilliant industrial renaissance. I
s a claim for indemnity paid otherwise
han in cash.
Against these terms on which Franc*
s bent Germany will, of course, figh
o the last gasp. But if her Austria!

Question of Time in West.
The allies in the west are on th<
ure way. It is only a question of time
Is to time, opinions differ. Optimisrr
s perhaps highest "at the front. Man}
^ the best French and English solders
are very sanguine. They believe
hat the wedge driven into the enemy's
ines in the west will widen as it adantes,
and that when it is, say, tweny
miles broad, it will thrust forward
nth cumulative power. These sailers
think that the Franco-British
orces in the present long, slow push
rill not only reach the line Bapaume'eronne,
but the line Cambrai-St
iuentin. This would compel an extenive
German retirement south of the

in terms not of acres, but of men.
he German strength is being melted

ave ever>r reason to think that their

Again, the Germans are bound
d go on counter attacking on a larger

lans.
Main Calculation Destroyed.
In this way the enemy's main calcuition

NEW YORK, August 5.?Sur*
face car traffic ceased in the
e boroughs of Manhattan, the
" Bronx and Richmond at 8 o'clock
B
- tonight. At that hour the city
* was in the grip of the most
a serious transit blockade in its
? history.
Brooklyn was the only borough
in the greater city not affected
- by the strike of motormen and
" conductors. Only a fraction of
the normal number of cars was in
t operation in the borough of
s Queens, although the railway
? company that operates the lines
f there was more fortunate than
the other public service corpora*
tions affected in retaining the
? services of a large number of
i loyal employes.
> The menace of a general
e strike that would include the
- elevated and subway lines was
growing hourly more threatening
tonight. Union organizers
? declared employes of the comh
pany were reporting constantly
y at headquarters to be enrolled.
e William B. Fitzgerald, the geng
eral organizer, declared that
s by the middle of next week
a every employe of the Intero
borough would be a member of
- the union.
S
~ Engineers Seek Conference.
^ A new element of danger, so far as
^ the traveling public is concerned, was
s injected into the situation tonight
s when William D. Mahon, president of
I* the Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric Railway Employes, dee
clared that a delegation of the Broths
erhood of Locomotive Engineers, rep- '
resenting: the men working on the
railroads running into the city, had
called upon him and asked for a conference.
They were invited to con ?
fer tomorrow afternoon with union officials.
e It was announced at headquarters
that this probably meant the members
1 of the brotherhood would walk out in
t sympathy with the carmen if it were
j found necessary and thus tie up the
steam and electric roads running into
New York. Mahon and his associates
" were much elated over the new devel1
opment.
I Discontinued for Night.
At 8 o'clock tonight orders had been
issued by every street railroad in Man1
hattan and the Bronx and on Staten
1 Island (Richmond) to discontinue serv;
ice for the night. An hour later not a
t surface car wheel was moving in the
5 three boroughs. The management of
> the Manhattan and Bronx lines said
> they would attempt to resume service
tomorrow morning, but no effort wili
r be made until Monday to operate cars
i on Staten Island.
One after another the New York
Railways Company, the 2nd Avenue
and 3rd Avenue ^Railroad companies,
the Union Railway Company, which op!
erates in the Bronx, and the Richmond
Light and Railroad Company notified
, police headquarters that they had suspended
service. The number of passengers
carried daily on these lines is
estimated at 2,5U0,0u0.
; Steady Stream of Jitneys.
Within an hour after the halting of
I traffic steady streams of "jitney" ve
nicies were nowmg inrougn broaaway,
5th avenue and other streets running
north and south, as well as through the
crosstown thoroughfares. Hundreds of
automobiles, taxicab and auto truck
owners did a thriving business. In
most instances the fares were not exorbitant.
For crosstown rides the regulation
charge was 5 cents, while longer trips
uptown cost from 5 to 20 cents. Fifth
avenue busses and sightseeing cars
were crowded to capacity.
Throngs of half-holiday excursionists,
returning from nearby beaches and
pleasure resorts, waited vainly for surface
cars and then philosophically descended
into the nearest subway station
or climbed the stairs to the elevated
platform. This traffic, added to the
usual Saturday night throngs on the
overhead and underground trains,
caused serious congestion. Extra trains
were operated and additional platform
guards and ticket sellers were requisitioned.
Strikers Work on Trucks.
On many of the large automobile
trucks fares were collected by striking
conductors, some of whom wore their
fMlway uniforms. Others were in
charge of taxi cabs and hacks. They
explained they had pooled their earnings
and bought second-hand conveyances,
determined to benefit as much as ,
