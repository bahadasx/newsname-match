INDIVIDUAL LOSSES RANGE
FROM $100 TO $20,000
Some of Crops Destroyed Were
Finest in State—Much Stock
Lost.
Anamoose, Aug. 6.—On Thursday
evening, August 3, the country north
of here was swept by a terrific wind
storm accompanied by hail which did
hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of damage to crops, besides
practically every farmer suffered
more or less loss caused by the storm.
The storm took in its path the ter­
ritory to the north of Karlsruhe and
going due east striking the heavist
in this vicinity about twelve miles due
north of here, to which point the
storm seemed to divide itself in two
sections, one going in an easterly di­
rection and the other in a southeaster­
ly direction. The small town of Or­
rin was practically missed, one wing
passing to the north and the other to
the south.
Boy Is Killed.
George Schmaltz, residing twelve
miles north of here, is one of the
heaviest losers by hail. He had in
the neighborhood of 1,600 acres in
crop and every acre of it is a total
loss. The wind was not so fierce at
this place, but three or four miles
north Qt him, Kasjtejr Laqher 4oat.aU
of his buildings Except fii& house. His
loss amounts to several thousand dol­
lars oti buildings, besides losing half
of his crop by hail. Matt Wright, a
rancher living northeast of Orrin,
lost a boy about ten years old and a
girl is now lying unconscious in the
hosiptal at Drake. Flying timbers of
wrecked buildings is the cause of
their death and injury. Mike Goetz
lost his barn and one of his best
horses. About Ave miles southeast of
Orrin a number of large barns were
totally destroyed. The entire path of
the storm took all small buildings,
haystacks, broke up machinery, wag­
ons and buggies and shattered thous­
ands of tons of hay, and other evi­
dences of damage too numerous to
mention.
Loses 'Horses.
Otto Zahnow, living five miles north
west of (Anamoose, lost three of his
best horses, worth at least $700., in
the electrical storm which visited this
section, while the hail and the hurri
can wrought havoc further north S.
Martin, living about ten miles north­
east of here, suffered a loss of about
2,000 in the destruction of his fine
farm buildings.
The wheat crop was the best in the
territory covered by hail and storm.
Many farmers from near and south of
Anamoose whose crops are seriously
injured by rust and blight, had hoped
to get their seed wheat from the far­
mers who .have lost their crops by
hail.
The e$act amount of the damages
done by this storm cannot be accur­
ately estimated, but it Is sufflicent to
say that every farmer in the path of
the storm suffered a more or less
loss ranging all the way from $100 to
as high as $20,000.
NEW PHYSICIAN WITH
Dr. George Lipp, Chicago, one of
the best known physicians of the
Northwest, is now associated with
iRoan, Fisher & Strauss. He has just
begun his duties here.

NO TRACE FOUND AS
YET OF MISSING MAN
Alex Barta, the prominent fanner
residing about 15 miles northeast of
Dickinson, who disappeared from
Gladstone recently while in that town
hiring harvest help, has not as yet
been located.
Mr. Barta had a large -sum of mon­
ey in his pocket when he disappeared,
and it was thought at the time that
he might have met with foul play.
Others advanced the opinion that he
had become temporarily deranged and
left for some outside point by train.
Every effort is being made by the
family and friends to find trace of
the missing man, but up until now no
definite news has been received.
There was a rumor for a time that
Mr. :Barta had been seen in Mandan,
but this has not been confirmed.

HEAT VICTIM HIS
TO
Bohemian Requests Deputy Sher­
iff Welch to Rid Him of All
Worldly Cares.
Deputy 'Sheriff Welch was some­
what astounded and for a moment just
the least bit suspicious that he had
an insane patient to deal with last
Thursday afterhoon, when a Bohemi­
an rushed into the sheriff's office at
the court house and requested that
he be shot immediately, if not sooner.
The request was made in all earnest­
ness and the Bohemian fell on his
knees before the astonished officer
and begged and pleaded that his re­
quest be carried out to the fullest de­
tail. With tears in his eyes he an­
nounced' that he was tired of life and
wanted to be taken from this world
of cares and burdens.
It will be remembered that Thurs­
day was one of the record hot days
for the year and the man was un­
doubtedly overcome with the heat.
Mr. Welch secured medical aid and
proceeded to administer a shot In the
arm with a hypodermic needle to the
heat victim, instead of a shot in the
head with a bullet from a deadly wea­
pon. The man was placed in a cell
and, after resting comfortably for
some hours, was released and pro­
nounced completely cured, at least for
the time being. Nothing more has
been heard of him and it is presumed
that he is again perfectly happy and
contented to spend a few more days
in this world, even though they be fill­
ed with burdens and cares.
The deputy sheriff stated yesterday
that this was the first time that he
has been requested to voluntarily take
the life of a human being, although he
has been forced on many occasions
to shoot dogs and other animals espe­
cially at this time of the year.

London, Aug. 5.—In a successful ef­
fort to straighten out their lines be­
tween Pozieres and Thiepval, north
of the Somme, British forces have cap­
tured the main German second line
system of defenses on a front of 2,000
yards, north of Pozlers. Several hun­
dred prisoners were captured.
German counter attacks were re­
pulsed with heavy losses, London as­
serts.
Further than stating that a new
battle was developing near Pozieres,
Berlin made no mention of the latest
British advance. British, however,
from iNorth of Ovillers to Foureaux
wood, were repulsed. In the Somme
region Paris says there has been
only artillery activities while Berlin
claims the repulse of the French ad­
vance south of the Maurepax.
On the right bank of the Meuse, in
the Verdun region, the fighting con­
tinues to be bitter. Paris says the
forces of the German crown prince
made unsuccessful efforts to drive
barded the- Tliiaumont. Berlin men­
tions bitter fighting near Thiaumont
works and reports-the capture of 468
prisoners.
Intense Fighting Near Brody.
Intense fighting is reported as tak­
ing place south of Brody. The Rus­
sians crossed the Strueh river, cap­
turing-positions near Tchiscopady and
repulsed counter attacks. Berlin says
Russian detachments, which crossed
the Strueh here, were forced to re­
treat. Northwest of Zalosze, in the
same district, Russian attacks were
repulsed. Petrograd admits the re­
tirement of several detachments from
mountain passes in the Caucasion
southwest of Kuty, in the face of
heavier Austrian forces.
Turkish Forces Attacking.
The British positions at Komani, 22
miles east of the Suez canal, are being
attacked by a Turkish force estimated
at 14,000 men on a front of seven to
eight miles.- The attack, London as­
serts, has made no impression, while
on the southern flank the British have
taken between 400 and 500 prisoners.
Rome reports slight progress on the
Trenino. An Italian attack east of
Monfalcone, on the Carso plateau, re­
sulted in the capture of some prison­
ers.

Minneapolis, Aug. 5.—Operations of

today of two men and three women.
Grimm was found late last Wed­

was in the grip of the nibst serious
transit blockade in its history. Lines
affected by the strike are estimated
to carry an average of 2,500,000 pas­
sengers daily.
Brooklyn was the only borough in
the greater city not affected by the
strike.
The menace of a general strike that
would include the subway lines is
growing hourly more threatening.
Union organizers declared employees
of the company were reporting con­
stantly at headquarters to be enrolled.
William B. Fitzgerald, the general or­
ganizer, declared that by the middle
of next week every employe of the
Inter-Burough would be a member of
the union..
A new element was injected into
the situation tonight when William B.
Mahon, president of the Amalgamated
Association of Street and Electric
Railway employees, declared that a
delegation of the Brotherhaad of Lo­
comotive Engineers, representing the
men working on the railroads running
into the city, had called upon him and
asked for a conference.
It was announced at union head­
quarters that this conference tomor­
row afternoon meant the members of
the brotherhood would walk out in
sympathy with the car men, if it were
found necessary, and thus tie up the
rail and electric roads running into
New York.
(Within an hour of the halting of
the traffic streams of "jitney" vehicles
were flowing through Broadway, Fifth

of automobiles, taxi-cabs and auto
truck owners did a thriving business.

of Equity, the Patrons Buying and

Jim Harris, one of the strongest
Equity men in the slope, president of
the Patrons Buying and Selling
Grange of Mercer, Dunn and Oliver

Foreign Powers Believed to Seek
Information Regarding
Fortifications.
Washington, Aug. 5.—Activities of
persons suspected of being spies em*
ployed by foreign governments to to*
quire information regarding thenatur*
and expense of the defenses of the
Panama canal, have made the admin*
istration decide to request congress
to supplement the existing lajrs
against the improper acquisition of
knowledge and naval plans and forti*
flcations.
Representatives of the war apd
navy departments are expected -to
agree upon drastic legislation to Tie
submitted to congress. It is impos­
sible that the scope of the conference
may be extended to cover general?
such attempts as have been common
since the beginning of thep resent war
to destroy munition plants uj(jon
which the United States government
must rely in time of trouble.
Several powers are believed to h§ve
undertaken to obtain information as
to -the defenses of the Panama canU.
The latest incident to excite suspicion
Is, the operation of a little Japanese
boat, »*lc^ywtt|^t A PtiUtt

thorites have been warned that this

POLITICAL
Senator Lewis of Illinois Assails
Republican Party and
Hughes.
Washington, Aug. 5.—-That Mexico
has a political issue in the national
campaign was discussed in the senate
today, Senator Lewis of Illinois as*
sailing the Republican party and Mr.
Hughes, the presidential candidate,
for attacking the administration
"without regard to facts, equity or
justice," and Senator Ball of New
Mexico replying.
Senator Lewis bitterly denounced
the Republican leaders for their "fcs*
sault of President Wilson's Mexican
policy, characterising them as "un­
reasonable," responsibility for the
deaths of American soldiers at Car
razal being placed at the door of the
.. Republican party, charging that "not
Unt
the captain of the Republican
party shot at the president of the
United States would the Mexican vat
laws shoot at the soldiers of the
American government" He referred
to opponents of the governments
cause in Mexico as "blunt, tarnished
votaries, headed now by the newly ap.
pointed chief of this political mon­
archy, the nominee for president of
the United States, Charles Evans
Hughes." "'I'"**'!
An assertion by Senator Lewis that
the United States at one time was
about to recognize General Villa as
head of t^e de facto government was
seized upon promptly by Senator
Shaw, who declared that this admis­
sion would give the Republican parti
its best weapon of the PAmpatgn,
