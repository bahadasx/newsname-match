In a powerful two days' offensive the
British have pressed back the German
lines north and west of Posteres on a
front of almost two mies for a distance
from a quarter to a third of a mile.
After three days of terrific fighting
northeast of Verdun, the French have not
only halted the German offensive. but

their counter stroke. They claim to hold
the strong Thiaumont work. the greater
part of the village of Fleury. and im

the battle.
Two powerful German attacks on the
Vaux-Chapitre front, delivered during the
afternoon, were broken up by the French
fire. The first did not even succeed in
approaching the French trenches. A
counter-attack routed the Germans after
they had gained some ground in the sec
ond assault.
The losses of both sides In these two
great battles have been enormous. accord
Ing to news from the front. Thousands
of bodies lie unhuried. while grievously
wounded men are being left to die on the
shell-swept battleground, owing to the in

Germans Applaud Elevation
of Hindenburg to Com
mand of East Front.
fBy the International News Servise.)
Berlin, Aug. 5.-Rising exultation is felt
throughout Germany over the elevation
of Field Marshal von Hindenburg to com
mand all the German and Austro-Hun
garian armies in the eastern theater of
war.
The war office has made admissions.
practically in regard to the Galicia cam
paign, that had begun to arouse anxiety
In some quarters. and for some time there
has been an insistent demand that either
Field Marshal von Hindenburg or Field
Marshal von Mackensen be placed in
supreme command on the eastern front.
Already German troops have been sent
r Into Southern Galicia to stiffen the Aus
tro-Hungarian defenses of the Carpa
thian passes where they were threatened
by the Russian army of Gen. Lechitsky,

in Volhynia and Galicia, and to break

fears In Berlin that the Russians would
break through the German defenses in
Volhynia by a direct drive against the
foices of Gen. von Unsengen. but there
has been some apprehension that the Rus
clans might be able to flank the Ger
man armies in Volhynia by driving in a
northwesterly direction through Galicia.

Indemnity for Alleged Vio
lation of Neutrality
(By the Internatienal INews Service.)
Amsterdam. July 22. - Denmark has
sen forced to pay a secret indemnity
) Germany for failure to maintain strict
eutrality.
The indemnity exacted is understood to
e as much as 80,000,000 kroner (about $22,
1,000).
The offense occurred last winter, when
1e Baltic Sea was invaded by British
ubmarines. To enter the Baltic from
he North Sea it Is necessary to pass:
irough Danish waters, strongly guarded
y forts. Germany secured evidence that
he English submarines could not have
ntered the Baltic without the permis
ion or connivance of the Danish gov
rnment.
Of all the Scandinavian countries, the
anes are the strongest sympathizers a
rith the allies and have the strongest
ntipathy to Germany.
German merchant ships plying between
wedish and East German ports with
yod. rubber, and copper. constituted the
nly German merchant traffic which the
rar had not suspended.
When the U-boat raids ceased. Ger
iany waited to see whether Denmark
rould protest to England against the
iolation of the neutrality of the Sund.
'here was no protest. A few weeks later
n E-boat, flying the British flag, came
brough the Katagatt and appeared be

The E-boat commander asked -permis
Ion to pass through. Permission was
