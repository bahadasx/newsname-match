CASEMENT MEETS HIS DEATH
SE
"1 DIE FOR MY COUNTRY" ARE
.AST WORDS UTTERED BY
IRISH PATRIOT.
London, August 5. Roger Case
ment, former British knight and
consul, was hanged at 9 o'clock
Thursday morning in Pentonville
jail for high treason. He was convict
ed ,of conspiring to cause an armed
revolt in Ireland and with having
sought German aid to that end.
Two hours before the execution a
crowd of men, women and urchins
gathered before the prison gates.
Twenty minutes before Casement
mounted the scaffold the great pris
on bell began to toll. The sound was
greeted with cheers from the crowd,
intermingled with some groans. At
9 o'clock the crowd had swollen to
such proportions that it extended
for two blocks from the prison front.
At one minute after 9, a single
stroke of the bell announced that
the trap had been sprung. It was the
signal for a mocking, jeering yell
from the crowd which suddenly melt
' ed a way into profound silence.
Casement met his death with calm
courage, according to eye witnesses.
Early in the morning two priests of
the Roman Catholic church adminis
tered the last rites in the cell of the
condemned man, and shortly after a
little procession, headed by the cler
gymen, with Casement following, a
warden on either side, proceeded to
the execution shed, only five miles
away. The priests recited the litany
of the dying, Casement responding
in a low tone:
"God have mercy on my soul."
According to one of those present
Casement's last words were:
."I die for my country."

GEORGIA LAWYER IS STABBED
ANO HOUSE DOORKEEPER HEED
B. FELDER, WELL KNOWN
POLITICIAN, IS VICTIM
OF KNIFE.
Atlanta, Ga., August 5. Thomas
B. Felder, prominent member of
the Atlanta bar and well known for
the part he took in the South Car
lina dispensary cases several years
ago, was stabbed and seriously in
jured here Monday night. G. K.
Vesson of East Point, Ga., door-
keener of the lower house of the
Georgia general assembly, was ar
rested, charged with the stabbing,
which took place in the lobby of the
Kimball house in the presence of
scores of members of the general
assembly. It is said by legislators
that the affair grew out of Felder's
recent efforts before a committee
of the House to defeat a bill by
which the city of Savannah's char
ter would be amended to permit a
vote on recall of city officials.
Felder, representing certain pro
I hibition elements, claimed the recall
of Mayor Pierpont of Savannah was
sought by those favoring the bill.
The attorney and house committee
men recently exchanged hot words
over the bill which was tabled, but
Vesson declined to explain his in
terest, if any, in the affair, merely
issuing a statement saying he was
not the aggressor in the altercation
which preceded the stabbing. Wit
