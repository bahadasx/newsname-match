WASHINGTON, Aug. 5. Charles
K. Hughes has embarked on
.Mews presented In his speech of nc
i triiiisi-iiiilini-iitiil trip which will
determine largely his chances for
;hc presidency. Not only will he
niakn addresses In expansion of the
.eptancc, but ho will seek to iron
out differences In the Republican
irganizatinn and to weld into that
organization the Progressives who
ire hanging in the balance.
That .Mr. Hughes will have his
work cut out for htm Is recognized
even by the Republican leudi-rs in
Washington. llo will speak in Dc
roit on Monday, in Chicago on
Tuesday, in Minnesota on Wednes
day and In North Dakota on Thurs
day. There are somo knotty problems
!n Michigan In connection with the
attitude of a small number of Pro
gressives, but confidence is expressed
hat this state will continue in the
Republican column. .Michigan also
will elect a I'nited States senutor,
and Senator Townsend's friends are
confident that he will be returned.
Good Feeling In Illinois.
In Illinois, oh a result of the direct
Interference of Mr. Hutches, a better
feeling prevail, as between the old
uard Republicans and the Progres
sive. Thin stats - Is rooelvlng the
especial allenlion of both parties.
The Itcpubllran leaders count It
surely for Hughes, but the Demo
crats believe they have a good fight
ing chance, and they propose to ex
liHust every effort to carry It for
Wilson. The president, during the
campaign, will make speeches in
Chicago and other Illinois cities.
There is little doubt Minnesota
will go Republican. The Progres
sives virtually have amalgamated
with the Republicans, and the Dem
ocrats do not intend to spend much
time or money on this state. Min
nesota will elect a Republican sen
ator, and the chances are described
as two to one In favor of Frank 1!.
Kellogg, the Republican primary
candidate, who has tho support of
Mr. Hughes and fromer Presidents
Roosevelt and Taft
Will SM-ak ill Xorth Dakota.
So certain were Mr. Hughes' man
agers of carrying North Dakota that
they contemplated having their can
didate Jump from Minneapolis to
Spokune, Wash. This was represented
to be inadvisable and Mr. Hughes will
speak nt Grand Forks and Fargo and
also at three points in Montana.
There are two tickets only in eacu
of these states. In North Dakota the
Nonpartisan Farmers' league indorsed
tho state ticket selected by a primary
and the candidates on that ticket as
sembled and agreed unanimously to
support the Republican ticket from
top to bottom. President Wilson got
the electoral vote of North Dakota
In 1912, but It Is declared he cannot
possibly do so In November, becauso
the Progressive party has been elimi
nated. There Is a possibility of trouble
with tho Nonpartisan league, several
of the managers of which are in
clined to support Mr. Wilson. Hut if
they should come out for the presi
dent, It Is asserted most of the mem
bers of the organization would stand
by the Republican candidates. The
Itepubllcans are confident Senator
McCumbcr will be re-elected 2 to 1.
Dixon Out for Senate,
In Montana, Joseph M. Dixon, who
was the campaign manager for
Colonel Roosevelt in 1912, will be the
Republican candidate for I'nited
States senator. Mr. Hughes will
speak, of course, In support of the
Republican ticket. Rucked as he Is
by Colonel Roosevelt, this state,
which Is Btrongly pro-Roosevelt, is
counted as safe by the Republicans.
It would seem the Pacific slope
states would be certain to vote for
Mr. Hughes. Tho Democratic tariff
struck at the Industries of those
states and they have other causes
for ill feeling against the administra
tion. Reports of dissension between the
Progressives and Republicans have
reached Mr. Hughes and unless har
mony should be established it Is ad
mitted that Washington, Oregon and
California may go Democratic. In
Washington and Oregon some former
Progressive leaders have " established
Indeitndent leagues, which are In
conference with the Democrats.
California Is Bai-geroiis.
Senator Poindexter Is a candidate
for re-election from Washington. He
hes performed able service In the up
per house of congress; has been true
to the Interest of his state and the
nation and always has voted right
tut Mr. Poindexter Joined tho Pro
jrrefsive tanks In 1912. and now has
returned to the Republican party.
There Is an exceedingly dangerous
condition for the Republicans In Cali
fornia, and Mr. Hughes must display
exceeding tact and Judgment In order
to aesure ihe electoral vote of the
tat for his candidacy. Under nor
mal conditions the Republicans would
carry the state by one hundred thous
and majority, but the conduct of the

ABOUT BAD DRIVER
Then City Court Official Plasters Fiius
on Man for Disorderly
Conduct.
Three youths, aged 5, S and 10,
filed down the uisie in municipal court
yesterday afternoon and one by one
climbed upon the witness chair to
complain ugalnst .lames Cassidy. As
a result of their stories Cassidy was
fined $25 by Judgo Cuvitt for assault
and battery.
Cassidy, who is a laundry wagon
driver, was arrested Friday when an
officer saw him reach out and savagely
lash at the three youngsters with his
buggywhip. Cassidy said that the
boys had aggravated him and had
frightened his horse by shouting
"whoa," "back" and other orders
while Cassidy was trying to back his
wagon up to the curbing. Judge
Cuvitt decided that a man with such
an evil temper should be given some
thing to take its edge off.
"Kin wo go home now, mister,"
said the youngest of the three com
plaining witnesses, as he looked into
the face of the Judge after tho cuso
was concluded.

ton during the year ended July 31
was placed at 14,171.000 bales by
Secretary II. G. Hester of tho New
Orleans cotton exchange. In his an
nual report Issued today. These
figures compare with takings of
1.1,519.000, tho prevlvous season and
14.512.000 bales two seasons ago.
Southern mill takings placed at
4,047,000 bales, broke ull former rec

"These values", the reKrt explains,
"are for cotton only and do not in
clude the value of the cotton seed
which, this year more than any past
year, constitutes a specially important
Item. The value of the 1915 crop,

The country's commercial crop for
the vear was 12.938,256 Isiles, a do
crease under tho previous year of
2.1 69.7755 bales and 1,944,237 bales
under two seasons ago.
"of the decrease in deliveries un
der last year", Mr. Hester reported,
"fifty-six and nine-tenths per cent was
in Tex:is. 27.2 per cent in the other
m If stati s and 15 9 per cent in the
Atlantic states. In grade the crop
ranked with the best during the last
five years, averaging middling and
strict middling ami it was marked by
a scarcity of low grades and irregular
cotton. The average price for
middling for the year was 11.99 cents
per pound. compared to 7.94 last
year and 13.49 cents the year before.
"A short crop and increased con
sumptive demand, especially from
American mills, offset in a measure
the influence of the Kuropean war
and the large carry-over at the end of
the previous season, resulting in
restoration of values to a more nor
mal basis. The records Indicate that
not only was every bale brought Into
sight from the fields consumed, but
that the visible and invisible supply
left over from last year was trenched
upon to the extent of almost 2,0OO,UOU
bales. In brief, the problems of war
and the enormous growth of 1914-15
have thus far been met to an extent
more satisfactory than anticipated by
the most sanguine."

WASHINGTON. Aug. R. Activities
of persons suspected of being spies

acquire information regarding the na

the world are believed to have un

excite suspicion is the operations of a
little Japanese power vessel, ostensibly

obtain a permit for pearl fishing In

"At last tho army is summoned,
the mercenary, tho concessionaire,
who pollutes the government in
power to wrest the rights from the

pean bondholder demanding of the
sovereign I'nited States that shall

may give value to vested Interests

and whose existence is being main
tained by fraud; that minining buc-
canneers of the mountains, the land
pirates of the plains, pillagers of
the peons, oppressors of liberty, de-
spoilers of homes, murderers of Jus

is found for you a house in which
you are worstuppcii as gods and
whose altars the innocents are to be
sacrificed for you to make an -lec

"We knew that tho administration
was at one time ready to recognize
the thief, assassin, murderer I'ancho
Villa, but this is the first time I
ahve heard a follower of the ad
