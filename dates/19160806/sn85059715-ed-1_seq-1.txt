NEW YORK. Aug. 5.?Surface car
"traffic ceased in the boroughs of Manhattan.
the Bronx and Richmond at
8 o'clock tonight. At that hour the
city was in the grip of the most serious
transit blockade in its history.
Brooklyn was the only borough in the
greater city not affected by strike of
motormen and conductors. Only a
fraction of the normal amount of cars
was in operation in the borough of
Queens.
The menace of a general strike that
would include the elevated and subway
lines was growing hourly more
threatening tonight. Union organizers
declared employes of the company
were reporting constantly at
headquarters to be enrolled. William
B. Fitzgerald, the genera! organizer,
declared that by the middle of
next week employes of the interborough
would be members of the union.
No attempt of danger so far
as the traveling public is concerned
was injected into the situation. William
D. Mahon, president of the
Amalgamated Association of Street
and Kleetric Railway Employes, declared
that a delegation of the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers representing
the men working on the
railroads running into the city, had
called upon him and asked for a conference
and they wore invited to confer
with union officials.
May Walk OutIt
was announcod at headquarte-s
that this probably meant the members
of the brotherhood would walk
out in sympathy with the carmen, If
it were found necessary, and thus tie
up the steam and electric roads running
into New York.
At 8 o'clock tonight orders had
been issued by every street railway
in Manhattan and the Bronx and on
Statcn Island, (Richmond) to discontinue
service fof'the night. An
hour later not a surface car wheel
was moving in the three boroughs.
The management of the Manhattan
and Bronx lines said It would attempt
to resume service tomorrow morning,
but n effort would be mado until
Monday to operate cars on Staten
Island.

One aft' r another, the New York
Railways Companies, the Sixth Avenue
and Third Avenue Railroad Companies,
the Union Railway Company,
which operates in tho Bronx, and
I Hie Richmond Light and Railroad
Company notified police headquarters
that they had suspended service.
The number of passengers carried
daily on these lines is estimated at
ii,500,000. Within one hour after
the halting of traCle, steady streams
of "jitney" vehicles wore (towing
through Broadway, Fifth avenue und
other streets running north and
