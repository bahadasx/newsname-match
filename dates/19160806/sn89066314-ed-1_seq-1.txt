NEW YORK, Aug. 5 Republican
Nominee Hughes started his stumping
tour today. It will carrv him across
the country to the Pacific Coast and
back again, with a few dajs' vaca
tion sandwiched in between times,
at some spot in Glacier National Park,
Montana.
Originally Candidate Hughes plann
ed a dignified speaking tour with set
appeals for votes in onlj a dozen or
so of the big cities en route to the
Pacific Coast. He expects to remain
a uaj or so in eacn or these large
cities conferring with local leaders,
But the moment he announced a
transcontinental tour he began being
bombarded with appeals from Repub
licans for speeches in their home
towns and today it appeared that
Hughes would do a regular "barn
storming" tour rear platform
specchts and all.
Four j ears ago Colonel Roosevelt
established a precedent for liveliness
in transcontinental tours and with
Hughes' ability as a campaigner his
friends were betting today he would
equal if not better the Rooseveltian
record for strenuositj in speaking
dates.
With the Governor travels Mrs.
Hughes. It is a brand new departure
for the wife of a candidate to be with
him on campaign tours. But Mrs.
Hughes has alwavs been one of her
husband's, most trusted advisers and
assistants in mapping political strate
gy, and besides she wanted to see that
he kept well, bo it was decided to
have her along. Governor and Mr3
Hughes, two secretaries, a messenger,
the Governor's personal press agent,
Carl D. Sheppard, formerly a Wash
ington newspaperman, and a messen
ger will occupy one private car on
the trip. Hitched on to this will be
another private car for politicians,
local committees, and newspapermen.
On Mondaj, Governor Hughes will
make the first set campaign speech
of the season at Detroit. Tuesday he
will speak In Chicago, and then he
goes to St. Paul.

With the National Association of
Master Bakers, now in session at Salt
Lake Citj, Utah, considering the rais
ing of the price of a loaf of bread
from 3 cents to 10 cents, the majori-tj-
of Columbia bakers jesterday ex
pressed themselves as being favorable
to the increase on the grounds that
with the present cost of flour so high,
thej could not make a profit by sell
ing a 14-ouncc loaf for 5 cents.
Some of the bakersthought it best
to reduce the size of the loaf and
practitallj all said that if the con
vention decides to raise the price.
thej would raise the price here.
The bakers in Columbia look upon
the probable raise in the price of
bread as the only solution to the high-cost-of-flour
conditions. At the pres
ent price thej say they are not mak
ing any profit. It is impossible, ac
cording to one grocer, to buy bread at
4 cents a loaf and deliver it at a
cost of 5 cents. After deducting the
expense in tires, gasoline and time
there is absolutely no profit and
probably a loss.
One baker suggested that a 5-cent
raise would be too much, that it would
be better to sell the bread at 8 cents
a loaf, or two for 15 cents. However
he said if the national organization
decides on a 10-cent loaf he was go
ing to stick with them.
Another solution was offered by a,
uuKi-r. ne saia inai mere were a
few- bakers that were selling their
loaves for 5 cents each and making
a 2-cent profit. The only way they
can afford to do this is by making the
bread smaller. Some of these loaves
weigh 10 ounces; the standard 5-cent
loaf weighs 14 ounces, he says.
The question of a rise in the price
of bread excited one baker, and he
blamed the whole thing on the people
of Columbia because they buy their
bread from Kansas City and St. Louis.
He said this practice will throw the
small baker out of business, and as
soon as the big bakers have a clear
field, they will charge for the ship
ment.
Columbia bakers, however, say they
will not raise the price until they
hear the results of the convention of
the national organization in Salt Lake
JAMES W. DWYER IS DED
CHICAGO, 111 , Aug. 4. The 5-cent

cry with which 400 Chicago bakers
departed tonight for Salt Lake City.
Utah, to attend the annual conven
tion ot tne National Association of
Master Bakers, and to attempt to per
suade that body that 10 cents is the
lowest price at which a fair sized loaf
of bread can be sold with profit.
In the party were scores of bakers
from Eastern cities. They will be
Joined en route by other members of
the trade. Sleepers from Kansas City
and Omaha will complete the train.
"The small loaf is costing the baker
all his profits," said J. M. Bell, sec
retary of the national organization.
"In its making is the added cost of
cutting, marketing and waste, which
does not enter into the making of a
big loaf. The big loaf will keep tho
price of bread down."i
