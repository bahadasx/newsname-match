LATER REPORT
CHANDLGIt, Aug. 4. Chandler has
spung Into sudden and much to be re-
gTetted notoriety by the publication of
a story claiming that an Infant was
found in a box In the canal near
Chandler. Constable Beckham has
made a thorough Investigation of the
facts and finds that the story Is abso
lutely without foundation. No child
was found, not even a box. In or near
the canal or any palce else, the story
evidently being the result of a too
fervid imagination on some one's part.

FIZZLE SAYS
IL
(Douglas International )
If there exists in Arizona a crisis of
) gucn gigantic proportions that It
j threatens the very foundations of hu
j man liberty, as alleged by Gov. George
J Washington Peter Hunt, there are an
( awfu j0t of people, In Douglas who
j are asjeep at the switch. As far as
: Douglas hjjconcerorjl, it seems that
le alphabetical governor will have to
ngnt tne battle single-handed and
alone.
Never in the history of political
campalgn In Douglas was there such
a complete fizzle as the "Hunt for
Governor" meeting scheduled to be
neM ia8t nt.ht ai the Moone hail. The
gran(j total attendance was three. In
addition to the faithful three there
wag an International reporter, but of
However, the reporter was almost
the first to arrive and was the last to
leave. He kept sticking around in the
hope tthat another Hunt supporter
might show up for he wanted to write
about the "faithful four" which is
more euphonious that "faithful three"
but the hunt for another Hunt supp
porter was a vain one. Not another
one of the faithful darkened the door.
The meeting was scheduled for 8
o'clock. It had been ' advertised for
two days In both local papers and in
addition the Hunt henchmen had pass-
' ed the word down the line for all the
faithful at least to lend their presence
if they couldn't lend anything more
substantial. A big time was expected.
but a big time "was not had," as Gov.
Hunt might remark.
At 8:05 a lone Hunt supporter ap
peared on the scene. The door was
locked and the hall was dark. He
went out to look for the janitor. A
minute later Mr. Hunt Supporter No.
: arrived, followed closely by the Jani
tor, who opened the door and admit
ted the crowd. The reporter arrived
it 8:08 and immediately engaged th
trowd In conversation, but out of re
spect for their feelTngs talked only
about the weather.
Promptly at 8:10 the Hon. Charley
Francis, member of the Legislature
from Cochise county and an ardent
Hunt supporter, and the man who ad
vertised the meeting, put in an ap
pearance. He looked disappointed
and refused to respond when the
crowd called upon him for a speech.
The first Hunt supporter, overcome by
heat and disgust, soon left, but the

leaves but twenty-five days more in
which the voters can register. It Is
the request of the county recorder's
office that those who have not regis
tered do so at once and not put it
off until the last moment so that there
is a rush of work during the last few

primaries by 2281. The number of
voters who registered at the primaries
two years ago was 11,755, and at the
general election 12.811. In order to
equal the registration of two years
ago It will be necessary for an aver
age of nearly a hundred a day to be
filed between now and the time the
register closes. County Recorder
Murphy asks that the matter of regis
tration bo kept before the voters so
that a full registration can be secured.
The question of the changing of the
registration of those who registered
"No Party" and "Non Partisan" Is
still In the balance. County Recorder
Murphy this morning received a tele
phone message from Attorney Wiley
Tones who is at present in Disbee ad
vising him to the effect that he could
iiake the changes If requested to do
so. He stated to Mr. Jones that he
would take no steps In the matter un-

FOR ONE
TUCSON, Aug. 4. James Whltting
ton, motorman on the Belt line street
car, was a rich man for an hour yes
terday. After making one trip around
the loop In the morning beiwon 10:20
and 11 o'clock, as he walked through
his car to switch the trolley pole he
found on one of the rear seats an
innocent looking hand satchel, and
opening it. he found the receptacle
contained five packages, each labeled
fl.000. In United States currency.
But the possession of the riches
was of short duration. le had taken
the satchel to the front of the car for
afe keeping and as he neared the
orner of Congress street and Stoue
avenue he was accosted by four highly
-tcited Mexicans, two women and two
young men, who mounted the steps
describing the satchel, asked if he
had seen IL
stered as such from voting in the
primaries. He claims that they reg
istered in good faith at the time they
registered and that it was through no
fault of their own that they were de
prived of the vote and because of the
fact that their party has now gone out
I existence that they will have to
become affiliated with some other
party, as their party will have no tick
et in the field.
Mr. Murphy was shown the above
statement of the county recorder of
.-Mma county, but said "There will be
iO change made in any of the regis
trations made on the registers of Co
nine county until I get a written
opinion from the attorney general."
He Is still of the opinion that to allow
Indescriminate changes would result
in nullifying the primary election law.
Unless there Is a written opinion given
by the attorney general claiming that
he has the ight to make the changes
there are up to date 1,096 voters who
will not have a vote In the primaries
not counting the 192 progressives.
According to information received
today from Bisbee to the effect that
an attorney named Whitman, of the
Copper City, would mandamus Coun

him change the registrations, it Is be
