LONDON, Aug. 6. (12:02 a. m.)
The British official communica
tion issued at 10 o'clock last
night says:
"Including the capture of the
German trenches reported this
morning, during the last two days
we pushed forward our line north
and west of Pozleres some 4000
to 6000 yards.
"Troops from Australia, Kent,
Surrey and Sussex participated in
this operation and consolidated
won the position, despite the shell
fire which was especially heavy
near the Pozieres-Bapaume road."
Capture Many Prisoners
LONDON, Aug. 6 In a' successful
effort to straighten their line between
Pozieres and Thieval, the British
forces have charged the main German
second line system of defenses . on
a front of 6000 yards north of Po
zieres. The attack, which was made
by Australians and troops of the new
Kitchener army, resulted also in the
taking of several hundred prisoners.
German counter-attacks were re
pulsed with heavy losses. London as
serts. Further than stating that a
new battle was developing near Po
zieres, Berlin makes no mention of
the latest British advance. British
attacks, however, against the sectors
from north of Ovillers to Foureaux
wood were repulsed by the Germans.
On the French front in the Somme
region, Paris says there has been only
artillery "activity while Berlin claims
the repulse of a French advance south
of Maurepas.
erdun Bsttle Grows
On the right bank of the Meuse in
the Verdun region the righting be
tween the French and the Germans
continues to be hitter. Paris says the
forces of the German crown prince
made successful efforts to drive the
French from the Thiaumont works,
recently captured. The Germans also
bombarded heavily the sector of Thia
umont and Fleury.
P,erlin mentions bitter fighting at
Thiaumont work and reports Jhe cap
ture of 4GS prisoners during the Ger
man counter-attacks in the Fleury sec
tor. Russians Cross River
On the Russion front the most in
tense fighting is reported as taking
place south of Brody, in Galicia. The
Russians crossed the Sereth river,
captured positions in the region of
peniaki-Tchstopady and repulsed an
Austro-German counter-attack against
them. P.erlin says Russian detach
ments which crossed the Sereth near
Patyseye were forced to retreat be
fore ' Austro-German counter-attacks.
Northwest of Zalosze, in the same dis
trict, Russiau attacks were repulsed.

The British position at Roman!, 2?
miles east of the Suez canal, are being
attacked by Turkish forces estimated
at 14.000 men on a front of seven to
eight miles. The attack, London as
serts, has made no impression on the
British positions while on the south
ern flank the British have taken be
tween 400 and 500 prisoners.
Rome reports slight progress on the

General Joffre was in his private
office at headquarters when the party
of American correspondents arrived,
the visit having been arranged for the
anniversary of the opening of the war.
It was 10 o'clock in the morning but
the general had already begun his
work at 7:30 and had gone through
reports or fighting last night and early
today, from the Somme front and at
Verdun and also along the Italian and
Russian fronts.
General Pellee. his chief of staff,

(Bv Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5. Ac
tivities of persons suspected of
eing spies employed by foreign
govern-nents to acquire informa
tion regarding the nature and ex
tent of the defenses of the Pan
ana canal, have caused the ad
ministration to decide to request
congress to supplement the exist
ing laws against the acquisition
of knowledge of military plans or
fortification.

the scope of tin? conference may be

a mere protection of the secrets of
American coast defenses to cover
generally such attempts as have been
common since the beginning of the
present war to destroy powder and
munition plants.
Many F'owers Send Sleuths
Several of the military powers of
the world are believed to have under
taken to obtain information as to the
character of the defense of the Pan
amp, canal.
Jap Spies at Panama
The latest incident to excite sus
picion is the operations of a little
Japanese power vessel, ostensibly
Na fishing launch, which sought to
obtain a permit for pearl fishing
in the waters of Panama bay and
vicinity. The canal authorities
have been warned that this craft
appeared to have been making
surveys and that these were not
confined to the water, but extend
ed to the isthmus proper. , l
While these operations may have
been Derfectly innocent in intent, and
j only such soundings were made and
! bearings taken as might he incident
) to the pursuit of pearl fishers, the
I canal zone authorities have regarded
j the matter as of suffic ient Import
I unce to warrant investigation and re
port to Washington.
Meanwhile licenses have been with-
held until some general line of policy
can be formulated to govern all such
course and everyone can clearly see
what the final outcome is going to
be. The unity on all fronts is a great
characteristic of the campaign now
going on' and the effect is now appar
ent of the constant pressure on all
sides by t.'ie allies, who now have had
time to form their clans, thanks to
the sacrifices which the French na
tion has made at Verdun. We must
also pay full homage to the splendid
part our allies are taking in the in
creasing efforts along the Somme and
on all other fronts. The Russian ef
fort has now succeeded in organizing
and putting forward larger and larger
torces of men, drawn from their ap
parently inexhaustible sources of hu
man material and at the a sine time, j
fully arming these masses. T.'ie splen
did results of their efforts are shown
in what they have accomplished in
Galicia and along the entire eastern
front.

to England to show the vast extent
