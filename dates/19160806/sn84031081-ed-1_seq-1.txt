Tames, formerly :i colonel of Ihe
Villa army, leading about l"u men,
is making his way south and west
from the border tonight in an attempt
to join Villa in the .Mapinii district,
according to reports here. Tames,
who slaried from Juarez early today
with six of the volunteer defense corps
after failing to organize a revolt of
the garrison, was joined by eighty men
on Ihe outskirts of Hie town and by a
score or more from Ihe garrison at
Sauialayuen, thirty miles south, the
reports said. Pursuing him is a col

of the revolutionists.
