Believes War's End
In Sight in 5 Months
J. L. Garvin Expresses Britain's Confidence That Present
Great Drives, East and West, Will Bring
German Foe to Terms.
By J. L. GARVIN.
(By Cable to The Tribune.)
1.0' . 5. Te* BM frankly confess that apart from tho daily
cleath roll whirh chastens us the predominant feeling in England is one
of quiet, and we hope not undue, satisfaction with ourselves. That is a
rare mood in a society which carries self-depreoation to the point of mania.
You need not fear that we shall become complacent, The cost of
victory will be ton har>h. Thrre is still too rrruch to do in the war. The
- to bc grapplod with in peace will be too gigantic. For many a year
there will be. onough to keep us from laziness or conceit. That is why
Britain ly the strenpth of her moral as well as her material reorganiza
tion will probaHy be far greater than she has ever been. Meanwhil.-, we
are proud of our country and our men. We venture to think that by
oomparison witH the (.Iermans we are going to prove ourselves after all
the stror.ger stock.
Wa are coming to our own after the most prodigious work of total
reconstruction for war purpose-- that any people ever accomplished in two
years or even drcamed of doinp in that time. The (iermans do not praise
us -t-rillingij, but they admit that we have dor.e what they thought utterly
impossible. That admission is enough. The (Iermans add that it is all
because we hold the sea. We agree. But to hold the ?ea we have had
to keep at work a million men, including our best artisans, solely employed
in maintaining and increasing the fleet. Consequently, we have had to
create with one hand, as it were, an army on the Continental scale with
the stupendous ranpe of new munition factories which are in course of
equipping that army with the mightiest artillery in the world. Also?
again thanks to our women?we have kept up our exports very nearly to
peace level. We are Btill successfully financing, and shall finance to the
end, a war which is now costing one and a quarter million of dollars
evtrv hour.
Soldiers Still Too Brave.
Our boys have shown themselves as entirely death-defying as were
ever the Japanese. Without Oriental fatalism, they have yet leaped down
into a worse than Manchurian furnace with heaven's own light in their
eyes. All that CBfl be said against our boys, officers or rankers, is that

BEACH CROWDS
HELD BY TIE-UP
Richmond Car Strike
Maroons 20,000 at
Two Resorts.
At ?":15 o'eloek last night 20,000 men,
woraen and children frolicked at South
Beach and Midland Beach, on Staten
Island, happy in the possession of a
dirna carfare, a hot dog and a sea bath
and having the time of their live*.
Fifteen minutes later the sad sea wave*
were sadder, the hf. dog had grown
cold from inattention and the purchas
ing poaatbilitiefl of the dime had dwin
dlad to minus nothing. South Beach
and Midland Beach were transformel
from palaces of pleasure into abodes
of daapaat despnir.
For in those tifteen minute* the luck
|?aa 20,000 h?ard the 400 motormen and
conductor* of the Richmond Light U
Railroad I'ompany, which operate* all
the trolley line* in the Borough of
Richmond, had joined the atriking car
men and that all streetcar traffic had
*topped at 6:15 o'eloek. The front
rank oj the crowd patiently waitinp;
for transportation heard it first, when
a startef Iooked at his watch, gathered
up hi* red flags and hi* switch bars
aml said he guessed he'd be going home,
for thero wouldn't be any sense in
staying there with nothing to do.
Thousands Walk, Thoosands Walt.
"What do you mean nothing to do?"
asked a man.
"Kverybody but me is on a strike,"
raid the starter. "There won't be any
more cars until Monday, and maybe not |
then."
From that moment the crowd at both
Midland and South beaches didn't have
any fun. It is twelve miles by a dusty
road from the former resort to the
Municipal Ferry at St. George, and
eight miles by another dusty road from
South Beach to the ferry. The Rapid
Traaait trains were running occasion
ally, but they weren't running for very
many of the South Beach and Midland
Beach pleasure seeker*. for most of
those who frequent these resorts are j
lucky, as a rule, if they get through a
day of pleasure with a dime left for
ferry and carfare. Several persons of
a commereial turn of mind attempted
to inaugurate a 'bus gervice to the ,
ferry. but this wasn't patronized to any j
great eictent, either, because all the ,
half dollars and dollar* were in the;
hands of the hot dog and bathhouse
men.
Hot I*>f Men Are Happy.
It was walk or wait. Thousand*
walked and thousand* waited. Long,
after midnight the road* from the j
beaches were thick with unamiable
plodders. Hundred* of men and boys
on the beaches, lulled into a
broken sleep by the song of the sad
sea waves, but moat of the women and
children walked. A few hardy souls !
managed to reaeh the ferry hou*e and
board' 'i the late boat* to Manhattan
and New Jersey, their best clothes '
ist and their faces be- ;
1 Nobody was happy but the hot '
dog aad sandwfch man, who eheorfully
set aijuut preparations to furnith ;
breakfaat to thousands and snare the '
.g nickel.
The cailing of the Richmond itl '
followed a three-hour conference be- '
txreen B committee of the men and
William R. Rand, vice-president and
general manager of the raiiroad com?
pany. The men demanded an la -
af Adges from 25 cents an hour to 30

. :tion of the union. Mr. Rand
told them he would grant the iaeraaaa,
but could nut agree to recognize the

STRIKE ON GREEN LINES
US UP ALL MANHATTAN
Destruction of Property and Riot
ing Mark Spread to Richmond
and Queens.
MEN IN CITY ARE OFFERED
DOUBLE PAY TO BE LOYAL
60 Per Cent of Normal Day Traffic Maintained
?Walk-Out on Subway, Elevated and
B. R. T. Is Threatening.
The most important developments in the car strike situation
yesterday were these:
Not a surface car in the entire city, except in Brook?
lyn, was operated after B o'clock last night.
Service was discontinued through no lack of men to
man the cars, but through fear of violence. When ade
quate police protection is available service will be resumed,
said President Theodore P. Shonts.
Officials of the green car lines in Manhattan threatened
not to operate to-day unless the police promi.sed to put two
uniformed policemen on each car. The police otTered to
eomply wherever it was deemed necessary.
About 500 Interborough subway guards and ticket
agents formulated demands for union recognition and
higher wages and threatened to strike Tuesday or Wednes
day.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit employes repudiated I'resident
Timothy 8. Williams's loyalty letter. A strike involving
10.300 employes on the Brooklyn surface and elevated lines
is planned for the middle or the end of next week.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Fire
men promised cooperation with the street car men here.
Service on the green cars decreased from 60 per cent
in the morning to 30 per cent in the evening.
Every streetcar line in the greater city, with the exception
of the B. R. T., il crippled by a strike that is sproading rapidly
and which grows in bitterness. Yesterday's test of strength
on the green and blue cars in Manhattan and the surface lines
in Richmond and Queens offered scant hope of averting ? strike
ciill on the B. R. T. lines, the subway and the elevated. The
situmtion reached the most menacing stage thus far.
The two most serious developments of the day, as far as
the interest of some 5,000,000 persons who travel daily on lines
in the city is concerned, were those:
About 500 subway guards and ticket agents formulated
demands upon the Interborough for union recognition, increase
in wages and abolition of the long-graded scale. which neoessi
tates eight year::' service before the maxinuim pay is ohtained.
The men plan to strike Tuesday night or Wednosday unless the
company meets their demands.
B. R. T. Men Deny Statement.
A committee of B. R. T. employes claiming to reprer-ent
90 per cent of their fellow workers in Brooklyn prepared
at a secret meeting ? denial of the company's newspaper staite
mcnta that the men were satisfied. This committee charged
that signaturos to the loyalty letter published by Colonel
Timothy S. Williams, president of the B. R. T., were obtained
hv inl imidat ion.
All the green and blue cars which
were operated in noticeably decreas
ing numbers throughout the day uere
called baek to the barns at 8 o'eloek
last night and locked up. The Staten
Island Traction Company had to sus
pend operations when its men quit at
6:15 o'eloek. No Queens cars ran'
after 8 80 p. m.
It was announeed officia'.ly at the
Fiftieth Street and Seventh Avenue
car ban.s of the N'ew York Railways
Company?the green car line-that
r.o cars would be operated to-day, to
morrow or any day until Police Com
BliaaiotTtBr Woods promised to put two
uniformed policemen or. every car
that left the barns.
Inspector Cohen, when told of th
statement that no cars would be
