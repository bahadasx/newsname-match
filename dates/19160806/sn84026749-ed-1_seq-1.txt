NEW YORK. Auk. 6. The in
futile paralysis epidemic as
sumed alarming new proportions
today when 191 new cases were
reported in the Greater City with
thirty-three deaths for the twenty

These figures show an increase
of eighteen in new cases and
while the deaths were eight fewer
the disease continues to puzzle
the health authorities.
The week ending last night was
the worst since the beginning of
the plague and it is greatly feared
that the car strike will' add to the
totals because of the difficulty in
reaching new patients.

PHILADELPHIA. Aug. & Between
700 and 800 medical Inspectors early to
day began a partial enforcement of the
quarantine which will become rigid to

Tomorrow at midnight the Bute will
be quarantined against every child from

The quarantine, at this stage at least,

NEW t YORK, Aug. 6. The
great street car strike in Manhat
tan and the Bronx made itself felt
in real earnest today.
Following a night in which not
a single one of Manhattan's 2,700
trolleys left the barns, this morn
ing saw a sad attempt to supply a
makeshift service.
Up to early afternoon there was
an absence of rioting and dis
turbances, though the police fear
ed after many disquieting inci
dents last evening that there might
be a renewal of trouble arrtong the
striking motormen and conduc
tors. Hundreds of thousands were
eager to go tb the beaches and to
nearby resorts and the infrequent
street car service crowded the
subways and packed the elevated
lines.

Such a stoppage of traffic would mean
a practical paralysis of business, as
few of the working millions live within
walking distance of their offices.

doing all they can to prevent violence.
All the cars that were run today car
