Berlin (via Amsterdam), April 23
-Germany's answer to President Wil
son's virtual ultimatum will be dis
patched to Washington at the earlies
in the middle, possibly not before thi
last of the ensuing week.
Of all the signs and hints and omen:
with regard' to the outcome of the
crisis between the two countries. thi:
very delay of Germany's answer is thi
most significant; it points clearly to a
backdown on the part of the Germar
government, a dignified and gradual
but none the less complete, accessior
to America's demand that the live
of American citizens must be safe
guarded.

Germany wants war with America, of
that she is about to defy America by
nyins. "We can go no further, if yet
want a Fri k, you take the conse
quences," he Is sorely unfamiliar with
the aims tnd the ways and methods of
the German goternment in international
ioilien.

EASTER BATTLE DECLARED
PROOF OF TEUTON FAILURE
By C. F. BF.RTF.LLI,
Stal Corer edent of the lnteeatinnal Nres
Paris. April 2i.-Nothing in this war so
far Is comparable to the stupendous fury
of the Mort Homme battle which has
been raging fiercely for the past thirty
hours. The German crown prince Is pil
ing up regiment after regiment on the
slopes of that hill which is likely to
prove the graveyard of the Germans.
Today a clearer account of the course
of the battle during the past week
reached me. At the beginning of the
week the F'retch held the crest of Dead
man, but the crown prince's batteries
swept it with such a hellish fire that
Gen. Petain withdrew his front line to
the southwest, south and southeast
slopes.
On Thursday, however, Gen. Petain
sprung a surprise attack which gave him
the German trenches, his troops holding
them against several sharp attacks.
The lesson of all the fighting in the lat
ter part of the week is that the Germans
are now powerless to quell the French
lire and probably ik is exaggerat~ion to
say that Gjen. Petain sow has a decisive
superiority in this vital respect.
In other words the Easter battle has
shown once for all that the crown prince
cannot take Verdun.

A STRAN
Troops to Stay
U. S. Prep
It became evident yesterday that the
administmation has no present Intention
of withdrawing the troops from Mexico,
and that it Is preparing for possible con
flict with Carranza.
Presi'dent Wilson ani Secretary of War
Baker discussed a lengthy report from
Maj. Gen. Hugh I,. Scott, Chief of Staff,
who went to San Antonio to confer with
Gen. Funston.
After the conference Secretary Baker
announced that it had been decided to
grant Gen. Funston's : equest for a re
disposition of the forces In Mexico.
This was interpreted to mean that the
advanced troops will be withdrawn from
the so-called friction zone, in order to
stave off clashes with Carranza soldiers
and at the same time all American forces
will be rearranged so that they will pre
sent the strongest possible front to the
gathering Carranzistas.
Carransa Insists on Answer.
It was learned also on good authority
that Carranza is insisting that the State
Department reply to his demand for a
discussion of the withdrawal of the Amer
ican troops before he will consider the
subject of affording them protection from
his own armed forces.
The following statement was issued by
Secretary Baker:
"Gen. Funston recommends a redipo
sition of the forces in Mexico for the

the force of the defacto government of
Mexico. His recommendation has been
approved and Its execution left to his
discretion."
Late last evening Secretary Baker Is
sued a second statement. which follows:
"The statement made indicates nothing
whatever as to the time of the withdraw
al of the American troops. The whole
subject of their presence in Mexico is
under arrangements and negotiations con
ducted by the State Department."
VIlin Chase Halted.
The Secretary indicated definitely, how
ever, that the chase of Villa has been
temporarily halted pending the rediapos
tion of the American forces. The redis
position, the Secretary pointed out, is in
dependent of the subject of withdrawal
or the Parral incident.
Secretary Baker said also that nothing
has been decided about sending more
troops to the border or more troops from
the border into Mexico.
It was apparent last night that some
uneasiness has been caused at the State
Department by Carranza's latest notice
that he sill not discuss the status of the
American troops in Mexico umtil Secre
tary Lansing has replied to his note. A
State t>epartment official said:
"What Consul Gen. John H. Rodgers
has conveyed to the State Department as
to Carranza's refusal to treat further on
the subject In nst an ulmnatum, hut it is
more like it than anythIng else."

Special to the New York Sow and The
Wemhlagten Herald.
Oyster hay. April "3.-If the United
States goes to war with Germany. the
Roosevelts will go-all of them. The Col
onel said so today in a statement called
forth by the recent utterances: "Stand
by the President." but he spoke for the
men who would have to do the fighting
and who would die in thousands because
of the country's unpreparedness. Col.
Roosevelt said:
'Men are saying that they stand be
hind the President. or by the President.
I wish to speak for the men who, in the
event of war. v ill stand in front of the
Prestdent and between him and the for
eign enemy; and who, therefore, will
stand between danger and the men who
are behind or beside the President,
"These are the men who will go to the
war at once, if there is war with Ger
many, or with any other great power,
and who feel as I do, that we would far
rather go to war unprepared than see our
women and children murdered with in
punity, and the honor of the flag stained.
"But it is a wicked thing that the folly
of our ruters in obeying the behests of
the peace-at-any-price people and of the
asposttes, of anti-Preparedness should
maoke the sacrifice either* Useless, or else
neediessty and appallingly wasteful.
"In the event of much a way my four
sons wilt go, and oe and perhaps both of
my sons-In-law; I will go myself; the
young kinsfolk and friends of my eons
wtll go; so my words are spoken with
my eyes open."
