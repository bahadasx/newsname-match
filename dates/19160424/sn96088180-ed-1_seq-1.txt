In a quandary aa to bow almultane

undersea warfare at this time.
The United Press learned these
facts today from a high official. Ad

many could not make further con
cessions to America, but positively

Gerard will be advised to reject
anything short of compliance with
the American demand that the sub
marine of merchant ships cease until
new methods for conducting auch a
warfare are devised and ratified by
the United States. The significance
of President Wilson's auggestloa that
submarines naturally can notmiet

Is, not lessened. Germany must un
derstand that unless It demonstrates
Iti ability to operate submarines
legally against ahlpplng, auch opera
