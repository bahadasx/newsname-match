Refuses to Discharge Chief
Deputy Upon Recommenda
tion of Lewis
The state highway advisory board to
day decided to retain the services id
Chief Deputy F. I. Cantine at his reg
ular salary of 3.000 per year. StaU
Kngineer John H. Lewis reeommeuded
the discharge of Cantine since he had
no further work for his chief deputy
but the board voted to keep him on
the payroll and Mr. Lewis will be
obliged to skirmish about until he finds
something for Cantine to do.
This is the last step in the long con
troversy that started over a year ago.
shortly after the session of the legis
lnture. The legislature passed a law
abolishing the office of state highway
engineer and gave the work to the state
engineer. Mr. Lewis attempted to hike
charge and the board nbolished Henry
L. Bowlby and put F, I. Cantine in
charge of the highway department.
Then Cantine said he would take his
orders from the board alone and tbci.
a suit was brought in the supreme
court to establish the answer to the
question as to who was who in the eng
ineering department of the -state. The
supreme court decided that the legis
lators knew what they were doing: when
they consolidated commission and
held that Lewis was head ot the high
way department. Lewis used Cantine
until the work then pending was com
pleted and recommended the dismiss-ii
of Cantine in the interests of economy
since he had no further work for a
$3,000 man.
Today the board decided that Cantine
should be kept regardless of Lewis'
recommendation of dismissal and Can
tine remains on the state payroll.
Land batteries, said the statement,
drove away the flyer before he con.
drop bombs.

Diplomatic Rupture
Berlin, April 24. Emerging from
05 minute conference with Imperial
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg, Am
bassador (iernrd was besieged by
crowds of German and American corres
pondents today. He refused to discuts
the conference.
"Are you preparing to leave Ber
lin?" ono German nowspaper nrm
asked.
"I can say nothing," replied Gerard
"It will be impossible for me to speak
for perhaps two or three days."
Gerard carried no papers. This led to
an inference that he had not yet re
ceived the German reply. He immedi
ately went back to the American em
bassy and began writing a confident iul
cablegram to President Wilson. As fust
as he finished a -sheet it was coded and
prepared for the cable.
Americans are constantly calling at
the embassy asking for passports. Many
are leaving, believing that a brea:c be
tween tho United States nnd Germain
is -imminent.
Many Americans are sending their
families to Copenhagen to await the
outcome of the crisis. A large number
appealed to the embassy for fundi ai:d
advice. President Wolf of the Amer
ican chamber of commerce railed a
meeting for Tuesday to decide what
course should be followed in the event
of a diplomatic rupture.

Imperial Chancellor Yon Bcthinanu
Hoilweg returned from the kaiser's
headquarters at the front Sunday, bir
he has held no conference so 'far with
officinls. He has given no intimation
of the result of liis talk with the em

among officinls that the situation was
hopeful and a solution of it pr.ssiblc
without a break.
Neither Foreign Sen . .. Jn

were present nt the nendipiarters con
ference. Apparently the kaiser, Chan
cellor Hoilweg and 'Chief of Staff Von
Valkenhave made the decision. Gorerd's
early return coupled with newspaper
statements favoring a peaceful settle
ment were interpreted as meaning that
Germany had found a way to meet the
demands without suffering a loss of
honor.

Narrowly Avoided Clash With

Xamiquipa, Max., by wireiess to Col

z.e's Eleventh cavalry detchinent ar
rived here today after 30 days of cam
paigning. They brought the first ink
ling of the fact that a clash with Car
ranzistas under General ('arias had
bcon narrowly averted at San Borja.
The garrison was drawn up for a chargo
and the Americans were formed to ro
pe them when Major Howze rode be
tween the lines, waving his hat. The
expeditions mission was explained and
trouble avoided, Howze withdrawing
his troops. This occurred ten days ago.
Howze at one time was only 38 hours
behind Francisco Villa. He found an
abandoned cart, supposedly Villa's lit
ter. It contained a number of bloody
bandages. The column heard contradic
tory stories that Villa was only slight
ly wounded in the calf of the leg nnd
that ho had been jseri iiisly wounded in
the head. Howze believes that Villa is
still in Chihuahua state.
Howzc's detachment is in rags. They
claimed they went 20 miles farther
south than any of the other detach
ments. Stock Market Recovers

Tho markets uctions went fir toward

Professionals oversold the market and
sharp recovery was apparent in initial

Administration Not Willing to

By Carl D. Groat
(lTniM Press Staff Correspondent)
Washington, April 21. The question
of withdrawing American forces from
Mexico is far from settled toduy. That
announcement that the Americans will
be redistributed for the purpose of re
cuperation, pending an opportunity for
further cooperation with vie facto gov
ernment troops, means that the expe
dition widd remain south of tho border
longer than army men believed.
Withdrawal questions apparently rest
u)on the negotiations between Secreta
ry Lansing and Ambassador Arreden.lo,
which are likely to begin soon, 'fan
administration is not disposed to order
a retirement solely ou Currauza's sug
gestion. Tho redistribution of American
forces is interpreted to mean that while
the administration wishes to avoid an
othor l'urral incident, it likewise de
sires to bo ready to meet any activo
opposition.
Ambassador Arrcdendo has been
granted an interview with Secretary
Lansing at four p. in. today.
The redistribution of United Rtntes
troops at present contemplated consists
largely of recalling scattered bodies
from the arid, pasturclcss and foodlrss
regions of Mexico.
