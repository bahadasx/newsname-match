--
United States Ambassador Sends Con
fidential Reports to State Depart
ment Following Conferences With
Hollweg, von Jagow and Others.
GERMAN PUBLIC OPINION
SHIFTING IN OUR FAVOR
WASHINGTON, April 24. Confidential despatches from
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin indicate that Germany will
make certain concessions to the United States in response
to the note demanding the immediate abandonment of
present methods of submarine warfare.
Whether the concessions will be sufficiently broad to
meet the American demands appears uncertain. Officials
reflected an air of hopelessness for an amicable settlement
of the issue. '
It is understood Ambassador Gerard has received broad
intimations that the German Government will co to great
lengths (o presene friendly relations with the Inked States,
is understood to lime gained his impressions from officials
of the Itcrlin Toreign Office, including Porcign Minister Von
Jagow.
The Berlin Government is confronted with finding a
way to satisfy the United Slates without, arousing the ele
ment which insists upon a relentless submarine campaign.
Mr. Gerard's despatches are of a highly confidential
nature and were received during the night.
