ARGUE UJ. RIGHT
Kansas Natural In Federal
Court at K. C. Today.
Contest State Commission Rul
ing on Interstate Business-
Kansas City, April 24. The right of
a state public utilities commission to
establish rates for a corporation doing
interstate business was the question at
issue in the petition for a temporary
Injunction set for argument today in
federal court in Kansas City, Kansas,
which the receivers for the Kansas
Natural Gas company asked against
the Kansas public utilities commis
sion. The petition was the outcome
of two years' litigation, in which many
cities of three states Missouri, Kan
sas and Oklahoma have a vital in
terest as affecting their fuel supply
and the rates to be charged by the
distributing gas companies. Many of
these cities are among the eighty de
fendants in the case.
Permission to increase rates charged
distributing companies was granted
two years ago to the Kasas Natural
by a state court. The Kansas commis
sion took a hand when the distributing
companies threatened to raise the
price to consumers, and set aside the
court order by establishing a rate to
conform with contractual obligations
alleged to exist between tne distrib
uting companies and the municipali
ties. Then the producing company
went into federal court seeking an in
junction which was the case of chief
interest on the docket today. Appli
cations for a continuance of the hear
ing were predicted before court con
vened. UNE AT U. S. RECEPTION

Nation's Executive Replies Cor

Washington. April 24. William P.
j Mctomoe, cnairman oi me ueinucraui;
I national committee, today notified
j President Wilson that he will be un
; able to continue in his present position
after the Democratic national conven
j Uon in St. Louis and will be unable to
I direct Mr. Wilson's campaign for re
election.
Replying to Mr. McCombs's letter
the president expressed regret. Fred
B. Lvnch, national committeeman
i from Minnesota, is expected to suc
ceed Mr. McCombs and conduct the
campaign.
Mr. McCombs wrote this letter to
the president:
"I have just formed a new partner
ship for the practice of law which will
become effective on the first of May.
The change will necessitate my devot
ing substantially all my time to my
profession. My political activities must
be largely curtailed. My arrangement,
however, will justify my proceeding
through to the end of the convention
at St. Louis.
In Party Service 5 Years.
"In view of the party precedent that
the nominee for president is requested
to indicate his preference for the
chairmanship of the national commit
tee and in view of the unanimity of
I sentiment for your renomination, I am
1 writing you at the earliest moment to
let you know I could not under any
j circumstances assume the leadership
' of the coming Democrat campaign.
! "I am hapy in the thought, however,
that there are hosts of able and true
men who can very readily take my
; place. The Democratic organization is
' loyal to your policies and purposes,
i We all feel assured of a triumphant
i result for you and for the party nomi

I yerober. .r
r 'TI:-or' five years now' t have been in
the active service of the party and It
is with a keen feeling of regret, that I
forced to conclude that my activities
are of necessity to bs, more limited. If
within the limit of my time I can be
of assistance, be assured that I am al
ways available."
Wilson Writes Reply.
The president replied as follows:
"Have your letter of April 20, ap
prising me of your inability to retain
the chairmanship of the Democratic
national committee for the approach
ing campaign. I fully appreciate the
necessity you feel yourself to be under
to resign after the convention shall
have been held in June, I know that
you would not have reached such a
decision had not your new business
relation made it unavoidable. I do
not feel at liberty therefore to urge
you to make the sacrifice that a re
tention of the chairmanship would in
volve. You have made many great
sacrifices already for the party and I
know that I am speaking the senti
ments of all loyal Democrats when
I express the very deep appreciation
I have felt for the great services you
have rendered.
"I am sure that the greatest regret
will be felt at your retirement and
that a host of friends will join me in
the hope that your new business con
nection will bring you continued
abundant success."

SEES HOPE FOR PEACE IN CHINA
New Premier Believes Cabinet Will Be
Able to Meet Demands.
Peking, April 24. Confidence in thS
ability of the new Chinese cabinet to
restore peace was expressed today by !
Tuan Chi Jui who on Saturday accept-
eu the premiership, in an interview
granted the correspondent of the As

cabinet he says would be to restore
tranquillity.
"Yunnan (in which the uprising
started) and Kwei-Chow, provinces
undoubtedly will fall in line with the
reorganized government." Tuan Chi
Jui continued. "Tsai Ao (the rebel
leader) is very reasonable.
"Feng Wwo Chang (commander of
the imperial forces in Yang Tz Kiang
region) Is now settling the difficulties
in the Yang Tze Kiang province and
doubtless will succeed in his effort.
Kwang Tung is the only province in
which fighting is now going on. i

"Some of the demands made in the
southern provinces are unreasonable
but. I believe everything soon will be
adjusted
In reply to a question regarding tbjai
respective poeiR of the president a
now
the new cabinet the premier said:
"China now has a responsible cab
inet and premier. Full power dies in
their hands, not in the hands of the
president. The cabinet will move out
side the palace grounds and only mat
ter: of the greatest importance will be
referred to the president. The mili
tary hereafter will be under the minis
ter of war. It has been found it was
net good for the country to have the
ai my solely under the president. In
event of a declaration of war the pres
ident will act on the advice of the
cabinet.
"The state council has been dissolv
ed and the cabinet will direct a par
liamentary election to be held within
three months. The new parliament
will promulgate a constitution."
The first formal meeting of the new
cabinet with President Yuan Shi Kai
will be held tomorrow.

At Chancellor's Palace
Ambassador Gerard conferred with
the chancellor at the chancellor's pal-
ace this morning.
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Holwcgg,
j who returned from the kaiser's head
quarters early Sunday, has held no
conference thus far with foreign of-
if fice officials and has given no intima
tion of the result of his talk with the
emperor. But the general feeling
among officials today is that the sit
uation is still hopeful and that a so
lution is possible without a break.

Neither Foreign Secretary Von Ja

staff.

Otspatcti Roaches Washington.
Washington, April 34. There were
indications in official quarters today
that the tenor of Germany's forth
coming reply to the I'nited States de
mands concerning submarine war
fare, is known. A long message from
Ambassador Gerard i believed to have
conveyed the information.
Whether Gerard's advices support
unofficial reports that show likelihood
of Germany's concessions to the Amer
ican view, could not be told. No word
of the actual contents of his report
was available.
Official Reply Later.
This week, it is expected, will see
the arrival of the German reply Itself.
It is considered possible that Gerard
has forwarded tentative suggestions of
the German government. the latter
seeking light on the reception such
suggestions would receive if embodied
in the formal reply. Gerard, it is said,
is certain to be advised that anythinej
short of compliance with the i'nited
States demands that submarine war
fare against merchantmen cease until
new methods are devised and ratified,
will be rejected by this government.
Must Operate t"-Boats Legally.
In thir connection, it is understood
Gerard has been forced to make clean
to Germany if there is any doubt. aM
unofficial advices indicate there may
be that the United States doe not
ask abandonment of all submarine

nature meet the requirements of crul-
er warfare, is not lessened.
Germany is expected to understand
that, unless she can make an unex
pected demonstration of ability to ep
erate submarines legally against ship
pin;, such operations must cease en
tirely.
