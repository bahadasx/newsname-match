Wouldn't Let City
Water Be Used to
Scrub "Front Steps"
Recause George Cobaugh, general
utility foreman of the city water de
partment, Saturday refused to permit
City Commissioner K. 7.. Gross, su
perintendent of parks, to use water
from a fireplug along the park to
scrub Harrisburg's "Front Steps" just
north of the pumping station, the
commissioner had to order up the
Hope engine and pump the necessary
water from the river.
Neither Mr. Gross nor Assistant Su
perintendent Forrer would discuss the
matter at all and Harry F. Bowman,
superintendent of public safety, was in
Philadelphia on Saturday. He de
clared to-day to-day, however, that
Mr. Cobaugh had followed his in
structions to the effect that the water
from the fireplugs must be used only
in the city's fire service.
"Don't you use the plugs at times
to flood the streets or to open up
sewers?" was asked.
"Oh, well, yes," admitted Mr. Bow
man. "Of course, when we've got to
open up a sewer for the highway de
partment or some emergency like that,
why we've got to do the best we can."
"Why wasn't the park department
[ permitted to use the plug stream?"
| "Why should the park folks use the
water at all? Why should they want
jto wash off the steps and wall? Why
' not throw that dirt which had been
■ washed down from the slopes, back
upon the slopes again?" answered Mr.
Bowman.
