Washington, April 24. General Car-

j to his note of April 12 suggesting
1 llmt the American troops be recalled
from Mexico. This was learned offi-
ij cially today In connection with the
i fact that Elizeo Arredon, Mexican am-
; bassador designate, sought an inter-
. view with Secretary Lansing. State
'! department officials declined to dis-
) cuss the matter.
? Tlie Mexican embassy stated that
the request had not been transmitted

i known. This is understood to be made
ji dircctlj by General Carranza, through
I Special Agent Rogers at Mexico City.
A reply also would be sent through

Little difficulty now Is being experi

The troops that have been moving
for the last few days towards Colum

soon as they arrive at the border
base, and it Is expected that the en
tire 2300 will be along the line of
communications within a day or two.
General Scott said today ho had
not determined when he would leave
San Antonio. A rumor that he would
not confirm was that he was planning
to meet General Obregon at Eagle
Pass for a conference.
Pershing Carry ing Out Instructions.
San Antonio, Texas. April 24.
Moves in General Frederick Funston's
plan for a redistribution of troops in
Mexico are being made today by Gen
eral J J. Pershing
Details of the new plans have been
carefully guarded by General Funston
and General Hugh L. Scott, but it was
indicated that it does not provide for
the running of a new lino of communi
cation, or of the establishment of a
new border base. It is understood
that General Pershing will be instruct
ed to call in all mobile detachments
except those doing scout duty and
cuter on a period of recuperation.
Satevo Fighting Not Confirmed.
Overnight and early morning reports
from General Pershing made no men
tion of fighting at Satevo. Colonel
C. W. Brown, Major E. L. House and
Major Frank Tompkins are in the vi
cinity of Satevo, however, and it was
regarded as not unlikely that the re
ports from El Paso that they had been
attacked there were untrue.
