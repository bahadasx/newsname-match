Ulential despatches from Ambassador j
'Gerard at Berlin indicate that Ger- !
I I many will make certain concessions
to the United States in response to
the note demanding the immediate ;
abandonment of its present methods
of submarine warfare.
Whether the concession will be suf
ficiently broad to meet the American
demand appears uncertain. However
officials reflected an air of hopefulness
for an amicable settlement of
the issue.
It Is understood Ambassador Cernrd
has received broa 1 intimations
Ithat the German government will'go
jto great length to preserve friendly
| irolations with the United States. He
I lis understood to have gained his imipressions
from ofllcials of the Ber- ;
jlin foreign office, including Foreign
'Minister von Jagow.
The Berlin government is conifronted
with finding a way to satisfy
It.he United States without arousing
It-he element which insists upon a re- ;
Uentless submarine campaign.
Mr. Gerard's despatches arc of a
liighly confidential nature.

PITTSBURG. April 24.?Deputy
sheriffs guarding the plant of the
Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing
Company at East Pittsburg,
whore 13,000 men are on strike, used
their clubs Monday morning to force
a way through crowds of pickets for
workmen trying to enter the shop.
The principal fighting was at the Talbot
street bridge, where the pickets
linked hands across the street ulong
which the workmen passed. There
was much disorder before the deputies
were called, but it was said that
between 2,000 and 3,000 men succeeded
in getting inside the works.
One of the principal entrances is by
a bridge owned jointly by the electric
company aud the Peuns.vh^nia rallload.
Threats to dynamite it were
heard on the streets and a strong
force of railroad detectives was at.
once scattered over the structure.
All saloons in the village were
closed as a result of a conference between
Burgess A. H. Snyder and the
saloon men. who agreed to keep their
places closed until Monday evening.
This precaution was taken as this is
pay day and some $700,000 was to
be distributed among the workmen.
Seventy-six metal manufacturing
companies, whose plants are located
in Pittsburg and the surrounding boroughs,
announced through a signed
statement Monday that "after due
consideration" they would not reduce
the working hours in their respective
shops. The
companies, said to employ almost
100,000 men. considered the
eight-hour question at a series of
meetings held here last week, after
the employes of a number of shops
had demanded an eight-hour day, and
it had become known that other demands
were in preparation. Included
In the list are the Weatlnghouse
"Electric antTMahufacturing Company,
where approximately 13,000 men are
already on strike and the Union
