EL PASO, Texas, April 24.—While
the careers of Pablo Lopez and
Manuel Baca, two of Mexico's arch
bandits, were said to be ended today,
renewed activity by Canute Reyes
was reported In an attack on a
Mexico Central train with a total of
twenty-four passengers killed. Four
ot these were killed by shots from
the bandits and twenty were said to
have been killed when the Reyistas
finally wrecked the train between Tor
reon and Jiminez.
Lopez, who directed the massacre
of seventeen Americans at Santa
Ysabel last January is reported under
arrest at Chihuahua City. Carranza
Consul Garcia stated that Lopez was
undergoing the "third degree" to
force him to tell of Villa's where
"tbouts.
Baca, a noted Villista lieutenant,
*as reported to have been killed in
an attack on Santa Tomas yesterday.
The citizens or American troops, ac
cording to differing reports, repulsed
the attack.
Both Lopez and Baca have been re
ported killed several times and Amer
ican officials here awaited confirma
tion.
At the time reports arrived from
General Funston's headquarters yes
terday that immedf&te withdrawal
waa not planned, a mile long column
of Infantry was moving into Mexico
from the Columbus base. It was the
second detachment of reinforcements
to go forward.
The unofficial border view of the
Mexican situation is that the United
States troops will continue marking
time until the admittedly critical con
ditions facing the Carranza govern
ment are overcome by it.
Army officials frankly opposed to a
further advance south that might in
crease Carranza's difficulties, ft the
same time hesitated to withdraw and
leave Mexico to the mercy of anar-

Ixpez was brought to EJ1 Paso today

Ambassador Gerard dispatched a
long message to Washington last
night, following a Sunday afternoon
conference with Secretary Vua
Stumm, of the foreign office, and Dr.
Hecksher of the foreign relations com
mittee of the reichstag. This dispatch
should reach Washington today. Its
contents are a secret, but it was free
ly rumored that it contains at least
an outline of the stand Germany will
take in her former reply.
Chancellor Von Bethmann-HoUweg,
who returned from the kaiser's head
quarters early Sunday. morning, has
held no conference thus far with
foreign ofllce officials and has given
no Intimation of the result of his
talk with the emperor. But the gen
eral feeling among officials today is
that the situation is still hopeful and
that a solution is possible without a
break.
Neither Foreign Secretary Von
Jagow, Under Foreign Secretary Zim
merman nor Admiral Von Holtzen
dorff, chief of the admiralty staff, was
present at the army headquarters con
ference. The decision apparently was
reached by the kaiser, the chancellor
and General Falkenhayn, chief of
staff.
In many quarters the chancellor's
early return from the visit to the
kaiser, coupled with the unmistakable
attitude of the majority of the Ger
man press in favor of a peaceful
settlement, was taken to mean that
Germany has found a way to meet
the American demands without suf
fering any loss in honor. Though
this was a quite common interpreta­|but
tion, it was supported ln no way, ex
cept perhaps by the statement of offi
cials that they still hoped to avert
a break. Many leading Germans who
had previously favored an unyielding
policy ln the submarine controversies
with the United States, have taken
a new track since the arrival of the
latest American note. They now argue
