Reports 8 Ncn Members.
V. II. Xowell, Jr., chairman of
Committee Xo. 2 of the special mem
bership campaign of the Commercial
Club, reported thirteen new members
today, the most that have been re
ported for the first day of 'the cam
paign. Only three of the nine com
mittees were out today. K. M. Wat
son secured ten members and D. W. H.
Kurtz, Jr., reported three.
Tomorrow the campaign begins in
earnest. All nine of the committees
will be out and will report to C. O.
1 lanes, secretary of the club, at 9
o'clock sharp. Four of the nine com
mittees will have the University dis
trict and districts south of Uroad-
way.
Uoth classes of prospects were met
this morning, the knocker and the
booster, but the campaigners say that
the outlook is very encouraging. Most
of those who signed the membership
cards did so for three years. This
is done so that the secretary can es
timate the future income of the or
ganization. The canvass of the town is to be as
thorough as possible but should the
committees overlook anyone who
wants to become a member of the
club, he is urged to send his name in
by mail or see the committee in charge
of his district.

COLUMBIA, MISSOURI,
WILL HELP
HAVE BETTER ROADS
M.U. Extension Division to
Issue Information With
out Charge.
TO AID 3,700 MEN
Department Will Send Bulle
tin on Drainage to all
Highway Overseers.
.More than 3,000 Missourians will
be reached by a new plan of the Uni
versity, which is to help bring good
and better roads to .Missouri.
The plan has been worked out by
Charles II. Williams, secretary of the
Extension Division, in co-operation
with the faculty of the School of
Engineering.
"It has been my desire ever since
I took charge of the Extension Divis
ion to do something to assist in im
proving the roads in Missouri," says
Mr. Williams. "1 have been trying
to make my department reach out to
the people of every county of the
state and I know of no better way of
doing this than by helping with the
roads."
According to the plan, the Exten
sion Division will write to every road
commissioner, supervisor and overseer
in Missouri and send material on good
roads without charge. Dean E. J.
McCaustland was asked to prepare the
material, and one bulletin has already
been printed. Others will follow at
intervals of about one month. Ques
tions are encouraged and will be an
swered by the men of the School of
Engineering who are experts on the
subject of good roads.
The first bulletin was sent to more
than 2,000 road commissioners, super
visors and overseers. It is estimated
that there are ::,700 in the state, and
this material will be sent to all as
soon as their names and addresses are
obtained.
The first bulletin is on
Uoads" and takes up the
problems met in building
dirt roads. It was written
"Con ii try
drainage ordinary
by F. P.
Spalding, professor of civil engineer
ing, and edited by .Mr. Williams. An
other bulletin will be devoted to other
phases of road structure. Each bul
letin is prepared, printed and mailed
at the expense of the Extension Di
vision. The object of it all is to make
this department a center for the
spread of information on good roads
and to build up a stronger sentiment
for good roads throughout .Missouri.
