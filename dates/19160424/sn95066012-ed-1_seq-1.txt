A YEAR TO RAISE AN ARMY
Twelva Monty Required to Make
Soldier, Says Col. Church.
"The notion that Germany -bo
exhausted after the European '
thai ehe would be unable to attack i.
'V
United States In case of war between
the two countries 13 absurd," said Col.
W. C. Church,' editor it the Army and
Navy Joornal ln a recnt interview.
"Germany would never be better pre
pared for an attack. She would
have a country full of trained and
hardened soldiers and theoretically she
could come over here and take enough
out of the United States to pay off all
her war debts.
"As I say, that Is theoretical. The
fact Is, nobody can tell what would
happen. I dare say Great Britain and
France wouldn't care to have the Ger
mans seizing any territory in America
and would step in with their fleets to
prevent it And of course our own
fleet could make a good deal of trouble,
although our army under present con
ditions couldn't do much. However, 1
don't believe we are going to get into
any war with Germany, for 1 think
Germany will yield."
In Col. Church's opinion it would
take a year after war. was declared
for the United States to become a mili
tary factor in Europe. There would be
no danger of the Entente Allies calling
upon us for troops right away, for the
reason that we would have only raw
men to send them.
"The Army War College," ho said,
"has estimated that it requires 150
hours of military training a month feT
twelve months to prepare a soldier. If
we started to recruit now it would be
at least a year before an adequate
army could take ' the field. There
would be no trouble about getting vol
unteers. Remember, the civil war was
fought by men under 25 years of age.
Young men are really eager to fight.
The adventure appeals to them, their
patriotism is unsullied by selfish mo
tives and they haven't established
themselves In business and given hos
tages to fortune like the older men.
"But no matter how eager he is, a
eoldler has to be trained so that he
will obey commands automatically un
der the most trying circumstances.
You have read of a machine gun jam
ming at Columbus. I don't believe the
fault was with the gun. More likely
the reason was that we have no spec
ial force trained to handle this deli
cate mechanism, as every army man
knows we ought to have. In Europe
companies are specially schooled in
the handling of machine guns. These
weapons are handled by machine gun
companies who do nothing else. In
the United States we merely detail an
ordinary soldier to machine gun work.
Both the Hay and the Chamberlain
bills now before Congress provide for
rnachlnejrun companies and I guess
we'll get them sooner or later.
"If war were declared our fleet
would give vigorous and valuable help.
I. believe we would not attempt any ag'
gressive war, but would lay an embar
go on all German commerce, help the
Entente Allies with ammunition and
money and assign our fleet to relieve
Great Britain and France of their pat
rol duty in the Atlantic.
"There might be riots In the United
States, but they wouldn't last long if
the Administration adopted strong
measures at the start. Remember that
no sovereign possesses such despotic
powers aa tho President of the United
States possesses In case of war. He
can order wholesale arrests, and no
prisoner In the hands of the military
can tret away on a writ of habeas cor
pus from State courts.
"Secretary Stanton had 280,000 per
sons arrested in the course of tho civil
war. All his agents had to do wa3
to ring a bell and have a man arrested
and the arrested man couldn't get out
on bail or anything else. Rioters or
plotters would make little headway
after a declaration of war if thoy were
dealt with with prompt firmness, just
as in case of mutiny at sea ' or In an
army camp."
Col. Church said he believed tho
United States ought to have an army
of 1,000,000 men. He went on
"The fact that the little Mexican ex
peaiuon nas tanon about ail our nio
bile resources Indicates how limited
those resources are how unready we
are to tackle a nigger job. One re
fipocts a poor man for living In modest
quarters in keeping with his income.
Hut if the Vanderbllts and tho Astors
were to live in shacks wo should say
they were stingy and mean. Congress
has been stingy and mean. Congress

rich."

BERLIN ASSUMES
HERIMIIY HAS
Chancellor Von Hollweg Has Re
turned from the front
HAS CONFERRED WITH LEADERS
Nothing Known of
Conclusions
Official
Reached Outside of
Circles:.
Berlin, April 2.1. (via Copenhagen to
London). The return of the Imperial
Chancellor, Br. von Bethmann Holl
weg, to Berlin this afternoon, would
soem to justify the assumption that the
empire's responsible leaders at Great
Headquarters have finished considera
tion of the American note and reached
a decision concerning Germany's reply
What this reply will be is naturally
unknown to any but the highest offi
cial.
The Chancellor's return, it is under
tood, was not expected until Tuesday.
hence a general decision appears to
have been reached earlier than looked
for. There is no intimation of when
the reply will be formulated, but there
seems to be much significance in the
fact that the Lokal Auzoiger, which is
consistently well informed, says that
Germany's strength and prestige have
so increased In the last twenty months
in the eyes of the whole world that the
German Government has, indeed, only
to follow the. commandments of wis
dom."
The obvious deduction, according to
the view here, is that there is nothing
to prevent Germany's making certain
concessions if the leaders feel that
they can properly do so. Whether they
do teel that they can go thus far is, of
course, another question.

M was captured Saturday by Carranza
forces near the scene of his crime, ac
cording to information received yester
day here by Gen. Gabriel Gavira, com
mandant at Juarez. This news was
contained in messages from the Mexi
can government operator at Santa
Ysabol. who said that he had himself
seen Lopez. It was hoped information
regarding Villa might be obtained from
ope,:.
Three of Iopez's followers were cap
tured with him, the four being
taken in a mountain cave where they
had been hiding In a starving condi
tion. All are being taken to Chihua
hua City.
Residents of Santa Tomas also noti
fied Gen. Gavira yesterday that their
town was attacked yesterday morning
iv .Manuel Baca. recently reported
killed in an engagement with American
soldiers and 15 other Villa bandits.
They said that they defeated and scat
tered the bandits, after killing Haca
and several others.
Accompanying the message was a
request from the residents for infor
mation as to whether they could
claim a reward whh h they under
stood had been offered for the body
cf Baca. Gen. Gavira wired instruc
tions to have the body sent to Juarez.
Information regarding the capture of
,opcz and killing of Baca was for
warded to Mexican Minister Arredon-
do at Washington by Consul Garcia.
The news from Washington that
there was not present Intention to
withdraw the troops from Mexico was
received with satisiaction by army
officers at El l'aso, although they
frankly admitted that they wire puz
zled by the wording of Secretary
Baker's announcement. The words
pending an opportunity for further
co-operation with the forces of the de
facto government" were particularly
tho subject of discussion. The only
cooperation which will prove really
effective, in the opinion of officials, is
the use of the railroads, and they as
sume that secretary liaKers state
ment means a halt in the Villa pur
suit until the railroad question Is set
tied.
:t is not believed that Gen. Funs-
ton is considering the establishment
of a new line of communication which
would involve ihe abandonment of the
Columbus-Casas Grandes motor trail
The general' action in ordering 2:100
additional troops to Columbus and tht
detailing of additional forces to guard
the line south of Columbus indicated
that this route will be continued.

EMPLOYING HOME LABOR
Comrrent On Several Matters of

Editor of the Banner: You have
lately printed a good deal in regard to
trading at home nnd boosting Penning
ton, one and all, I think It is right to do
this, and every one who has a dollar
to spend should help our beautiful vil
lage in every way we can.
1 believe it our duty as citizens to do
this and never do any knocking except
to knock those who try to knock Ben
nington or tax payers of Pennington
therefore 1 phculd like to ask you how
mucii money tne firm who limit our
high school building left in Bennin

or town? How much monev will the
firm from Hudson Falls, who nre do
ing tho job for the E. . "Waist com
pany leave in this place for the same
impose? And when our new hospital
contract is lot, who gets that, some out
of town concern, I dare say?
Now I don't believe In such boosting
ns this. Most especially when we have
just as good men and mateal right
home ns can be found abroad, I say
give these jobs to men at home who
have a pride in our home town and who
have interest enough to do us a good
Job, and one that will stand inspection.
men who will not be looking for graft
and a chance to beat any one or slight
tho job.
Our own mechanics at home could
have given us a better job than we got
on our high school building if ull re
ports I hear r.re true. We exempted
the E. 'A. Company from taxes for n
term of years. How do they pay us
for it? Simply by letting their eon
tract to out of town parties who have
no ink rest here except to get all they
can out of us und leave Just ns tilth
here as they can . we better see at the
next March meeting that they pay
taxes on their new addition.
Again as to our merchants looking

produce as cheap as It citn be bought
In Troy nnd other nearby places? l.

III ONE FAMILY
149 YEARS
First Settled by Samuel Scott in
1767
AN ORIGINAL TCWN GRANT
House in Which Miss Ellen C. Scott
Died Last Week Was
Built in 1769.
By the death of Miss Ellen C. Scott,
whoso funeral was held Sunday from
her late home at West Bennington, the
continuous ownership o the farm by
the Scott family came to an end. By
an arrangement made some years ago
the property will now pass into the pos
session of James C. Colgate of New
York and become a part of the estate
surrounding his summer home at Old
Bennington.
The farm was one of the original 64
quarter rights included in the grant
from Governor Benning Wentworth of
New Hampshire in 174'J by persons,
many of whom resided at Portsmouth,
N. H. The land remained unsettled for
13 years until after the visit ol Capt.
Samuel Robinson who passed through
this section while returning to his
home in Massachusetts from one of the
campaigns of the French and Indian
war. Pleased with the country he
oragnized a party of friends and pur
chased the rights of the original gran-
teess.
The farm was first settled by Samuel
Scott, a native of Sunderland, who in
1707 built a log cabin near a spring on
the opposite side of the highway from
the present house. He was a man well
along in years when he came to Ben
nington and had been here less than
two years when he returned to Sunder
land on a business trip, was taken ill
and died.
Phlneas Scott inherited the property
from his father and In 170ft built the
bouse which lias since been occupied
continuously by members of the fami-
):'.
I' pen the death of Phineus Scott the
farm descended to Henry Scott who oc
cupied the property up to tho time of
his death at the age of S3 ill 1881. Of
his two sons and two daughters, three
passed their entire lives on the farm.
only one of them having mnrried. Of
the four the only survivor Is John Scott
the janitor of the graded school.

EASTER CONCERT
Musical Treat at Methodist
Church
Sunday Night.
Rarely since the days of the Choral
Union under the direction of Prof. Van
Olinda have the local singers given
such a musical feast as was enjoyed
Sunday evening by those who attended
the service at the Methodist church.
Ira Bishop Wilsou's "The Resurrection
and the Life" was presented by the
church choir, assisted by talent from
several sister churches, to an appreci
ative audience that taxed the capacity
of the large auditorium, many of our
most prominent music lovers being
present. The prelude by the string
quartette, pipe organ and piano held
the rapt attention of the audience
from beginning to end with its exquis
ite harmony.
The leader, Prof. E. E. Long, had
