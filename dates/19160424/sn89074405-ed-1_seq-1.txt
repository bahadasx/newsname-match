CITY OfJROOPS
Over 15,000 There Says S. S.
McDonald—Saw Parade
for Returned Soldiers.
6. S. McDonald, machinist for The
Herald, returned this noon from Win
nipeg, to which city he accompanied
his mother, Mrs. A. McDonald, who
was enroute home to Sherbrooke,
Quebec, after a visit here.
Mr. McDonald declared today that
Winnlpeg is a "city of soldiers?
"There are between 16,000 and 20.
000 soldiers there," he said, "and they
are sending them away day after day.
A regiment is sent to the front at a
very few hours' notice."
While in Winnipeg yesterday, Mr.
McDonald witnessed one of the war's
most tragic sights—a parade for the
returned soldiers. The parade yes
terday was conducted by the churches
and in the procession, riding in auto
mobllss, were men who had served
their ussfulnsss at ths front—men
who now will have to be cared for
during the remainder of their lives.
Some of them had had lege and arms
amputated, while others wore big
bandages on their heads.
Winnipeg is becoming used to this
sight Mr. McDonald said. Soldiers,
'maimed and battle-scarred, are re
turning every day and each arrival oo
casions its pathetic scene.
Despite the awful toll of war,
business conditions are exoellent, Mr,
McDonald said. Business men are
more optimistic than they have been
for some time and everywhere there
are indications of renewed prosperity.

Washington, April 24.—Confi
dential dlspatiches from Ambassa
dor Gerard at Berlin indicate that
Germany will make certain con
cessions to the United States
Whether the concessions will be
sufficiently broad to meet the
American demand appears uncer
tain. however, but officials reflect
ed an air of hopefulness for an
amicable settlement of the issue.
DESIRE FRIENDLY SETTLEMENT)
It Is understood that Ambassa
dor Gerard has readied brood ta-"
timattons that the German govern
ment will go to great lengths to
preserve friendly relations with the
United Btates. He is understood to
have gsined his Impressions from'
officials of the Berlin foreign of
fice. Including Foreign Minister
von ,1agow.
In view of the status of the subma
rine situation, it is unlikely that he
will mention that subject unless in
structed to do so by his government
between now and the time of his call.
No More Information.
It is stated authoritatively that the
German embassy has no more infor
mation regarding the intentions of the
Berlin government than has the state
department. In some diplomatic quar
ters the statement made in despatches
of the semi-official Overseas News
agency that Germany will act "along
the lines- of national dignity and re
spect for neutral' rights and interna
tional law, as well as for vital German
interests" is regarded as being a hope
ful Indication.
It is pointed out that if neutral
rights and international law were
strictly observed by the German gov
ernment. all sources of possible differ
ences with the United' States Immedi
ately would be removed. If Germany
should refuse to comply with the de
mands of the United States and diplo
matic relations between the two gov
ernments were severed, the moral ef
fect upon the other neutral, nations
of the world, diplomats consider,
would be, far-reaching.
Heretofore, tt. is known here, the
German government haa considered
the effect of contemplated actions up
on neutral nations, the United States,

probably will be before President Wil
son by Saturday. In the meantime
perhaps within forty-eight hours, Am

to be In a position accurately to fore
cast the contents of the document.
It is. confidently believed that the
German reply will be handed to Am
bassador Gerard on Wednesday or
Thursday and then about tw days
will be required for the work of cod
ing, cable transmission, and decoding.
From Mr. Gerard's informal conver
sations with officials of the Berlin for
eign office, is expected to come the
advance word of what is to be expect
ed.
The most recent despatch received
from the ambassador was RsiO to con
tain on!}• quotations from editorials
in German newspapers. These were
described as beinR virtually identical
with the editorial opininos in press
despatches. The general tone of calm
ness displayed by the German press
was noted with satisfaction. However,
the editorial expressions seemed not
to alter anxiety over the ultimate out
come. The Germ'aii embassy was with
out despatches from Berlin. Count
von BernStorff, the German ambassa
dor. was out of town. He returned
today, however, and during the day
may call at the state department in
connection with the return of papers
seized in New Tork by agents of the
department of justice from Wolf von
