Equipped witl a- set of" burglars'
tools such as are used by the notorious
"Gopher gang" of New Tork, two men
ntered the shoe store of S. B. Thing
& Co. at Main and Elm istreets early
yesterday morning and after breaking
open the safe stole $1,509.53 as well
as a number of velvet watch chains
trimmed with gold. The robbery was
committed sometime between" 11
o'clock Saturday night and 7:30 this
morning. , ' -
" Eight policemen are posted on the
beat that includes this store. They
dbdn't know of the robbery until the
manager of the Thing store reported
the matter this morning.
It is evident that two men pulled
the Job and that they gained 'entrance
by way of the alley in, the rear of the
store and east of the Salvation Army
headquarters in Elm street..- A wire
screen on the window of the lavatory
was torn from its fastenings. The
bplt on the rear door was broken with
a blow from the four-foot "can-opener."
--. ... ,
The safe is an old fashioned one and
is stationed, in the center of the store.
Jt is almost hidden from view from
the street owing to & projection in the
wall. It was "at the rear ot the safe
that -the burglars performed their
work.
The -money box was on the right
hand side of the safe. With, a brace and
drill a hole was cut directly back of
the money box. A fotir-f oot sectional
tool with 'a sharp point was then in
serted into the hole and worked back
and forth until 4he steel back of , the
safe was bent sufficiently to allow a
hand' to be thrust through the aper
ture.. , . " .
" The safe was lined' with asbestos
and plaster of parts. This was cut
outl. .nd one of the burfirlars was en
abled to draw he money box through
the hole cut in the rear of the safe.
The box was opened with a. two-foot
section tool in a manner similar to
that used In opening, the rear of the
vault; i - . ' ' S
In- the money box was $1,509.53. There
was also $2 in ' dimes Inside the safe,
which was overlooked by tlVe burglars.
A dozen pair of aluminum rings, used
as gifts to patrons 'of the store, were
taken by the robbers. "Velvet watch
fobs 'with gold, trimmings are also
missing.' ,A $10 bill was found on the
toor near the safe; th: j morning. ,
After perf orminthe ob without' in
terruption the burglars deposited their
tool kit on the floor-near the safe and
vacated the store by the rear entrance.
No stock is missing from the store."
When the clerk entered the place at
7:30 this morning he was astonished.
A gaping cutin the rear ; of , the, safe
was visible and a set of burglars' tools
consisting of a fou.r-f ooi and a two
foot can-opener, a brace and six drills
was lying on the' floor. '-.)
There are. no marks on. the "tools
which might lead to an arrest. The
sectional tools are bolted together in

Simon, Lake has again taken a pro
gressive step in submarine boat con
struction. Patents for new buoyancy
and collision protectors were granted
to him under date of April 6 by the
United States government. '
In patent, serial number 1,180,263,
application for which was made in
August, 1914, Mr. Lake, through his
patent attorney. Mercer D. BH5ndel,
Of this city, set forth many -new and
novel claims, chief among which are
the features of srreater freeboard.
greater metrocetric stability .-and ex
taordinary increased buoyanoy.
To give an idea of the improve
ments that ' are technically .called
"sponsons," one must 'first understand
that a submarine boat is constructed
on the form of a huge cigar, the inter
ior of which is hollow and filled with
machinery and air. This weight, even
with the air included, when submerg
ed, would sink like a bottle over-filled
with Water. The air would be con
centrated in one end and ;the boat
would sink by the, other. 'Tp over
come this principle, the cdnning tow
er was conceived by original subma
rine'. builders and later utilized as.'Sa
vantage point for observation. Prac
tically the only lateral stablity of .' a
submarine--today Is In the conning
tower where the air is confined in an
effort to seek a level when the boat is
submerged. The stability heretofore
is known to have been slight, meas
ured in pounds between 300 and 400.
The danger from . collision with
some ; underwater object or surface-"
vessel has always been the horror
of under-sea navigators.
Within the last two years the lateral
stability has been further decreased
be the necessity of imposing, a. super
structure upon the : cigar-shaped hull
for the purpose of mounting lateral
torpedo tubes and disappearing rapid
fire guns. While air chambers have
been provided they w,ere of such bulk
and the locations fore and aft were in
such -position, it is said, as to cause
submergence at too gi'eat angles for
practical safety. . It is because of this
lack of buoyance that - many of, the
German "subs" . are believed to have
been lost in the present war and Eng-
lish boats -of the oid diving type are
known to. have been lost. ' ,
Mi. Lake has arranged on each side
of the boat above -the cigar-shaped
hull and between the superstructure
casing two or more sponsons, or( hol
low cylindrical tubes, also cigar
shaped, which- are filled with air or
any buoyant substance such as cellu
lose or the other compounds known
to navy officials.' These sponsons on
the upper sides of the vessel,- taper
ing at both bpw and stern n no way
interfere with fjxe speed or navigation
of the boat and at all " times, on the
surface or-below act as additional sta
bilizers. Their bujyancy brings the
craft higher to the surface hen rid
ing the waves and permit of longer
rifle shots at an enemy. They also
act as protection against damage by
ramming and: cause the upper surface
of a submarine to became flat instead
of round, thereby greatly aiding in the
loading andunloading of cargoes and
the comfort of the crews when not in
active service. ,
It is likely that through the adop
tion of thsnewest of inventions the
conning towers,, which heretofore have
been the cause . of much resistance
when speeding beneath the waves, will
be displaced to a great extent. The
sightig above surface may be done
through a periscope, which will fold
back when the- vessel is submerged.

DISPROVES "ALIBI"
OF THE NEW HAVEN
Excuse That x Consignees
Won't Unload Cars Found
Flimsy One.
After an investigation that has last
ed more than a month the Chamber
of Commerce of Bridgeport has made
a repo-rt of freight congestion here.
The report exposes the excuse of the
railroad officials in which the .con
signees were blamed for delays, and
publishes figures to prove that this
explanation will not suffice.
' By collecting daily records from
consignees and keeping tabs on what
occurred in " the Bridgeport freight
yards, the Chamber of Commerce
claim to have learned that the case
has been misrepresented by the rail
road. The following statement, issued to
day by the CharViber Of of Commerce,
after an unbiased study of conditions,
is enlightening:
"The transportation committee has
been represented, at every important
conference , on New England freight
congestion that has been held this
winter. At a New Haven meeting
representatives of the railroad con
tended that much of the congestion
was due to the negligence of con
signees and their failure to unload and
free cars within the period of Tree
time allowance. Acting in conjunc
tion with fcther" associations, the com
mittee agreed to notify consignees of
all delays reported by th& railroad, and
to request an explanation in each
case. The report of the replies to
this notice during the -first 10 days af
ter notifications were sent out Is as
follows: '
Number of cars unloaded in free
time though reported" as iiot 7 "'"

The Berlin government is confront-
ed with finding a way to satisfy the
United States without arousing the
element which insists on a. relenUesa

Mr. Gerard's despatches are of a
highly confidential nature and were
received during the night.
An accurate forecast of Germany's
response, to America's "demands in the
subnaxine controversy is expected
from Ambassador Gerard within the
next 36 hours as the result of informal
conferences he has had with the Ber
lin foreign office officials.
The reply itself, it is believed, will

Wednesday or 'i'hursday, at tlm latest,
and will be laid before President Wili

Count Von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, who has been away on a

unlikely that it would ', be in connec

view of Its status, unless he had In

so. ...'"."
It was elleved that his call would
