As the officers were walking

It was the liquor hug.

It is very hard to see the willow,
weeping on h nlaiy day.
A stril<ln X peculiarity ahout th«
weeping willow In that it uevef
has to be watered. It's a selN
sprinkler.
Where one ran see and hear
the willows walling and wet-plug
I* In Washington, Oregon uid
Idaho since they went dry.
Nobody lian ever tried to find
the big cause for Hie willow to
weej), no we've got a hunch that
the babbling brook told the we#p
lng willow about how atrong ou»>
army aud navy is compared iq
other countries."
