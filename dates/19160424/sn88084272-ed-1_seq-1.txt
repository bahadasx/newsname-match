FIELD HEDQUARTERS. MEX . April

bus, N. M.. April 21.) There are
Indications in tho Villa territory in
Mexico that the work 01 the punitive
expedition under Gen. J. J. Pershing,
has been accomplished.
This work, according to press reports
received here from Washington, did not
include the death or the capture of
"Pancho" Villa.
VHllstas Are Dispersed.
The announced purpose was the dis
persal of VHllstas. and the establish
ment of safety for the American border.
The VHllstas have been dispersed for
several weeks, or else driven almost
completely out of the state of Chihua
hua, to a distance of nearly 600 miles
south of the American boundars'.
Americans fehoot to Kill.
Throughout this territory the people
have been impressed with two facts
which have inspired respect for Ameri
can soldiers.
These are that when Americans shoot,
they kill and that a handful of Ameri
cans cannot be successfully attacked
by even superior numbers.

Towspeople of Santo To-

in T3aster Battle.
Manuel Baca, a Villista general, with
a band of 15 men, rode into the village of
Santo Tonus, Sunday, and in an en
gagement with the townspeople, Baca
was killed and the majority of his fol

This news was brought to Juarez
Sunday evening in an official message
to Gen Gabriel Gavlra, the Carranza
commander.
The townspeople. It waB stated, were
weary of exploitation and depredations
and when Baca attempted a program of
loot, they turned the tables upon him.
The body of the Villista leader has been
requested by Gen. Gavlra to be sent to
Juarez. The people of Santo Tomas are
under the impression that a reward
has been offered for the apprehension

Little difficulty now Is being ex

Funston and Gen Obregon. Carranza's

Carranclsta officers, before this ex

holds, warned some of the American of
ficers that they would never be able
to cut loose from their bases and forge
ahead with such small bodies of troops.
In no instance has one of these small
detachments failed, nor have the Ameri

been oven threatened -with attack from
the superior forces of Villistas whom
they sometimes followed.
Thr 1.' -Mile lletrrnt.
In the Parral fight there was a 15
mile retreat by the Americans, but this
was due to the American commander's
desire not to hit civilians, which led
him to permit only a few of his men
the best shots, to return the fire of the
Carranza troops.
After their experience with Ameri
can columns, the Vilistas, It is believed
here, will be very slow to approach the
border of the United States. It Is
thought that they will hardly approach
this line at all, if they think that the
Americans can launch an immediate
pursuit of them across the international
line.

Cisco Villa, slightly wounded, but not

Details of the new plan have been care

principles of internation law, and
not unfavorable to the vital interests
of Germany.

the German government had decided
upon its reply to the American note. It
was added, however, that the nature of
the forth coming communication was
known only to the highest officials.
Germany Has Itenched Ueclslon.
Berlin, Germany. April 2S (via Co
penhagan to London. April 24.) The
imperial chancellor. Dr. von Bethmann
Hollweg. returned to Berlin this after
noon, which would seem to Justify the
assumption that the empire's responsi

ished consideration of the Americas
note and reached the decision concern
ing Germany's reply. What this reply
will be is naturally unknown to an
but the highest officials.
Germany Won't Weaken Campaign.
Germans of all parties, even those to
whom the idea of a rupture between
Germany and the United States Is most
distasteful, agree In feeling that the
governnient must refuse to weaken Its
