,KU CORRtRROHONCI TO MORHINS JOURNAL
Washington, April 23. Despite tho
solemnity of the president's message
the capital has already shaken off Us
depression and on Faster day nobody
anticipates an immediate break with
Germany. War between the two
countries is not yet thought probable.
The cause of this hope which
amounts almost to a confidence is the
distaste of America for uny part in
the scourge now blistering Europe. It
is a war which is abhorrent to the el
evated sentiments of peace held 'by
nine Americans out of ten and there
fore they can picture their country
plunging into it only as a last re
isnrt. Germany Has Much to Ijoso.
On the other hand there la Ger
many with an immense stake in keep
ing the peace with the United States.
It is freely predicted that she will
find means to satisfy the president
without loss of time. Those who ar
gue this way fay that Germany can
not afford a break with the United
States, not because of the damage we
might do her in a military way, be
cause this is at present, neglible, but
because of the effect of American
hostility on the other American neu
trals and for another and apparently
minor reason, but which has a great
Wfeet In fiC'i'mttiiy tlip ntnic of her
business affairs. They are In the
hands of American diplomats and
consuls all over the world, -
The counsellor of the German em
bassy, when asked about the effect of
tho withdrawal of these officials, us
would be the case if war broke out,
said without heltation. "It would be
disastrous to Germany."
GUul "Notes" At Over.
Thus while congress and the public
has already gotten rid of the war de
pression there is a feeling of elation
that America has at last freed her
mind, has put the whole tortuous
course of polite notes and polite re
joinders to polite evasions behind her
and has asserted her self-respect. She
will no longer be fooled or - fooled
with. This Is thoroughly determined.
The president has aald it and the
common voice of America reiter
ates it.
"Too many notes already," says
one.
"The last 'one should have gone
first," says another.
Deluy Is Criticized.
There Is no disposition to curse the
president though there is everywhere
a coolness toward him as toward a
man who has tried the scriptural
method of earning his penny at the
'Icventh hour.
He did this on preparedness. Oth
wg had sweated in the field for years.
Still others for months before Wood
row Wilson gave them encouragement
or countenance.
There are not wanting congressmen,
the leader of the house republicans,
among them, who attribute his mes
sage now to politics and denounce It
s hypocritical. in this Mr. Mann
undoubtedly goes too far, but many
riirtlicans feel that the president
was opportunist.
Those members of congress who
o not take this extreme partizan
jew, were not slow to manifest their
"satisfaction ,hat the. president con

at present. The president certainly
does not want congress to bring out
another squinting resolution and hold
an animated debate upon It, which
will exhibit America before the cen
tral powers divided and discordant.
There will bo nothing of this kind.
The Gores and McLemores cannot re
peal, What Is expected Is that con
gress, now conversant with tho steps
taken by the president, will await, as
ho does, the next move from Ger
many. If Germany fully complies
with the demands of the president,
diplomatic relations will continue und
there will be nothing left hut to asses
damages for the depredntlons already
committed. :
Walt on Germany's Decision.
But if Germany continues her pres
ent method of submarine warfare, if
another vessel unwarned is sent to
the bottom and another American
Is killed or put In jeopardy, tho presi
dent will hand von Bernstorff his
passports. There would be a period
of waiting until another overt act of
the same kind sent the president to
congress to lay the situation before
them finally. When he had severed
diplomatic relations the president
would be done. He would have to
leave the rcRt to congress. The mem

Accompanying the message was a
request from the residents for infor

claim a reward which they under

Information regarding the capture
of Ipez and the killing of Baca was
forwarded to Mexican Minister Arre

cia. Xo Immediate FvacuiM Ion,
The news from Washington that
there was no present Intention to
withdraw tho troops from Mexico was
received with satisfaction by army of
ficers, although they frankly admit
ted that thev were puzzled by the
wording of Secretary Baker's . an
nouncement. The words "pending an
opportunity for further co-operation
with the forces of the de facto gov
ernment" were particularly the sub
ject of discussion.
The only co-operation which will
prove really effective. In the opinion
of local officers, is the use of the rail
roads and they assume that Secretary
Baker's statement means a halt In the
Villa pursuit until the railroad ques
tion Is adjusted.
It Is not believed here that General
Funston is considering tho establish
ment of a new line of communication
which would Involve the abandonment
of the Columbus-Casns Grande mo
tor trail. The general's action In or
dering 2,30 additional troops to Co

forces to guard tho line south of Co

be continued.

Lopez- It waa reported, would not
give his captors any information
about Villa further, than to say that
he was "over yonder" In the distant,
mountains. But he did state that

General Gavira ulso received a
message from Chihuahua City to the
effect that Martin Lope, brother of

Further efforts by the British to ad

been systematically bombarded on the,

"'The lending troops of this bri
