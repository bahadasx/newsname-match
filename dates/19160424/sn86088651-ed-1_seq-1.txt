of this pasturage we must prepare
for It. While the pasture that Tom
ranged over was not a specially pte
pared pasture, yet It was a little wore
than just a piece of ground with a
fence around 1L It 'contvr.e 1 a lot
of native grasses and he didu't have
to go very far to gnt all !l:o'gras3 he
wanted. So if Just ordinary grasses
will make this difference, think what
the gain would have been bad this
pasture consisted of good hog-feeding
crops. Suppose it had been peanuts.
or cowpeas, or sorghum, or for that
matter, rape. Don't you know Tom
would have paid even more liberally
for It?
The moral Is that if we want these
good results from raising and feeding
our pigs this year we must commence
right now preparing good pastures
for them by planting suqh crops as
we know will give the best results.
The list at our disposal Is almost un
limited. There are sorghum and the
grain sorghums and cowpeas and pea
nuts and sweet potatoes and rape.
Properly planned and planted In sep
arately fenced lots, such crops should
raise our pigs without any grain feed
ing except just enough to Insure hard
fat. But they must be planned for
and planted now If we hope to get the
greatest benefits from them. It won't
do to depend upon native grasses, be
cause you remember that In July and
August most of these become pretty
brown and dry from the drouth; hut
a cultivated crop Is at its best Jus'
about this time, and If we have it tr
turn our pigs upon 'they will continue
growing and getting fitter Instead of
standing still and requiring mor
grain. Don't overlook this this
spring. Be sure to plant some hog
pasture crops. Progressive Farmer.
