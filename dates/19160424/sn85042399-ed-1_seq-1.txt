Is Hard at Work
Ashland Mine
Soon to Operate
The Ashland mine will be ready
foj operation within the next few
weeks after several years of Idleness.
A crew of men Is at work getting the
buildings into shape, hauling in tim
ber, lumber and supplies, and this
week will commence putting the ma
chinery Into shape. W. A. Bartlett,
who has leased the property for a
two-year period, went to Portland
the last of the week to make arrange
ments for such of the machinery
needed as could not be obtained in
Ashland. Dave Good's teamsters are
hauling in lumber and pipe which
will be used in constructing a pipe
line to bring water from a spring in
near Gulch.
There Is a ten-stamp mill at the
mine, and should this be put into
operation to its full capacity a crew
of at least thirty men will be needed
at the mine. The mill will be oper
ated by steam for the present, al
though later electricity may be used.
The Ashland mine is considered to
be one of the big mines of southern
Oregon and for years turned out big
money for its owners despite the fact
that nothing less valuable than fifteen-dollar
ore was taken out be
cause of the fact that It had to be
hauled to Ashland to the stamp mill
which was operated here. Mr. Bart
lett is very optimistic over prospects
at the mine.
Concerted Warfare
Is Necessary
About this season of the year dan
delions, which cause the owner of a
well-kept lawn more agony than any
other thing except the, neighbors
chickens, begin to appear. To suc
cessfully combat the dandelions, con
certed action everywhere in the city
is needed. Should one land owner
eradicate the pest from his yard and
his next door neighbor let the yellow
pest flourish, the efforts of the first
will have been in vain. Nature pro
vldes the dandelions with a very ef
fective method for reproducing them
selves. When they "go to seed" the
breezes carry the little tufted seeds,
and. lo and behold! today there Is an
army of dandelions where yesterday
there was but one.
The time-honored method of dig
ging up the weeds by the roots is ef
fective but requires unlimited time
and patience. A quicker method is
well worth a trial.
Experiments made by the Colorado
Agricultural College In the destruc
tion of the dandelions prove that they
can be quickly and permanently
killed with very little trouble or ex
pense. It was found that with three
applications at short Intervals of a
20 per cent solution of Iron sulphite
the yellow pests were completely
eradicated. After the first applica
tion the dandelions turn black , and
apparently die, but It was found nec
essary to repeat the dose to complete
their destruction. In the college
campus, which had practically been
taken by the dandelions, not a curvl
val was left after the third applica
tion. It is suggested that the iron
sulphite be put on witch a force spray.
The solution does not Injure the grass
in any manner.
Staples and Rouse
Face Grave Charge
Ed Staples and Ranse Rouse were
arrested yesterday by city and county
officials on a charge of soiling liquor.
Two men whose names are being
kept quiet, but who have been staying
at the Park Hotel, are held as wit
nesses. Prosecuting Attorney Keliy
is taking charge of the case for the
county. But little has been learned
of the details of the charges made
against the Ashlanders. ' The case is
being tried this afternoon in the Ash
land city hall. Both of the men were
released on bail.
According to reports, sixteen boot
leggers were arrested yesterday in
Medford in a wholesale haul. They
are said to have been actively en
gaged In disposing of a number of
barrels of liquor which were secreted
previous to January 1.
The Civic Improvement Club "will
meet on Tuesday evening and hold
their business session previous to the
lecture. The Civic Club's! meetings
are usually held in the afternoon; -the
change being made so that the meet
ing and the lecture may e attended
together. r . " o''-'
The dedication celebration commit
tee Is digging away steadily at the
plans for the big ehow on July 4, 5
and 6. A meeting of the full com
mittee was held last Friday and an
other will be helj Tuesday. The sub
committees are working on the Indi
vidual phases of the plans and things
are beginning to shape up and prom
ise some lively three days.
The first half of the subscription
payments are now due and subscribers
will confer a favor upon the hard
working committee by making the
payment immediately to Treasurer E.
V. Carter at the First National Bank.
Collection of the payments would re

Billie Burke Wins
Ashland Hearts
The biggest crowd which has at
tended the Vining Theatre since "The
Spoilers" visited Ashland filled the
theatre completely last Thursday
evening to see Billie Burke , In
"Peggy." And the picture pleased
every one who saw It. Billie was per
fectly irresistible and won her way
Into the hearts of the audience in the
very first scene. The plot was clean
and easily followed, the characters se
lected showed the genius of the great
est director, and the settings were
perfect, but it was the charm of
Peggy which makes the picture really
great. The music which was written
for the play and played by the Vin
ing orchestra added greatly to its ef
fectiveness. Lloyd Stratton sang
"Peggy," the song which was dedicat
ed to Miss Burke, in a most pleasing
manner, which won him a hearty en
core. It is such attractions as
"Peggy" which have built up the rep
utation for the best in photoplays for
the Vining Theatre.

Oak Grove Spellers
Win Class B Match
A big spelling match was held at
the Wagner Creek school Friday be
fore last. The two best spellers from
each o( the following schools were
present: Tolo, Agate, Howard, Oak
Grove, Griffin Creek, Applegate and
Wagner Creek. The schools of the
county have been studying two special
lists ot words this year, one ot 1,000
words and the other 500. These
words were used at first, and when
they were finished the review lessons
in the Champion Spelling Book were
used. The match lasted from 2.30 to
5 p. m. The winners were Elizabeth
Meyer and Wilbur Godlove of the Oak
Grove school. They spelled all after
noon without a miss. The two last to'
be spelled down were Pearl Tlmmons
of Agate and Arthur Moore of How
ard. The winners of this match are
to spell in Medford at the county fair.
The last two are to act as alternatives.
The schools of the county are di
vided into three classes, those of one
teacher, those of from two to five,
and those of from five up. The bet
ter teams from all the schools are to
meet at Medford during the fair and
spell all .day. This is something new
sending out spelling teams. The
pupils are enthusiastic over It and
in consequence are doing the best of
woTk. The Oak Grove school had the
highest percentage of any school in
the county with less than five teach
ers; in fact, every one in the school
got 100 per cent.

gate tho matter of erecting a huge
electric sign at the Southern Pacific

novel and effective lighting system j of tno remaining six. Further, Bnd
whleh makes the water appear phos- for(1 Bt(ltCg that tho elimination ot

comment from travelers. The chango
in the train schedule which brings

drink of the lithia as this train, which
Is popular, formerly went through in
the early morning hours.

"Safety First" on
Pacific Highway
Division Engineer T. A. Bedford
of the California Highway Commis
sion, with headquarters at Dunsmulr,
In a report to the commission says
that with the completion of the stato
hlchwav between Chiro and A:;h!and,
these crossings was not accomplished
by bridging over or digging under
the railrond, but tho manner in which
the highway was routed made it possi
ble to avoid the crossings. It is true,
he said, that in some instances the
locating cost a great deal of money,
but considering that it shortens the
total distance eislit nil'cs, eliminates
the crossings and lessens the danger
to human life, the outlay seems
dou!:ly justified.
He concluded his report with the
following:
"It will, therefore, be safe when
the highway is finished, for the mo
torist to drive from Chico to Orland,
In the sacramento valley, to Ashland,
lOre., without thought of grade cross
ings and fast moving trains, and if
everyone would stay on his own sldo
of the road and drive at decent speed
around the sharp curves, accidents
should be extremely rare and motor
ing In the mountains should be a9
safe as In the valleys, and a thousand
t'mes more enjoyable.
Valley Pleases
Cannery Men
Medford Tribune: Philip Larmon,
general manager of Llbby, McNeil &
Libby, cannery operatives, Mr. Mor
row, superintendent of their Califor
nia cannery plants, and H. S. Mathl
son, their expert, who have been In
the valley looking over the situation
for a large cannery, left Wednesday
evening after having made a thorough
Inspection under the guidance of;
County Commissioner F. H. Madden,
who interested them in the valley.
"They were very favorably im-.
pressed," said Mr. Madden after their
departure "and have left for Chicago.
where the proposed Medford cannery
will be put up to the directors ot
Llbby, McNeil & Llbby with a favor
able report, and with every Indication
of favorable action.
"It Is too late to figure on a can
nery for this year, as contracts for
the required produce must be made
in. advance, but they expect to have
preliminaries concluded, with a view
to having everything In readiness for
the next season.
"The pears alone will not Justify
a large cannery, as they furnish only
six weeks of operation, and in order
to fill out the season they will con
tract for a large acreage of spinach,
beans, tomatoes, beets, berries anil
other produce.
"Mr. Larmon stated taht he was
charmed with the valley and from his
examination of products was con
vinced that Rogue River valley pro
duced not only superior pears and
peaches, but many other products,
and that a high grade of goods can
bo marketed at a price making tholr
growing profitable to the producer."
