"Washington. April 24.—General Car
-f ranza baa asked for en early reply to
bis note of April 12, suggesting that the
ftp' American troops be recalled from Mex
lea. This was learned officially today
in connection with the fact that Elizeo
life Arrendondo, Mexican ambassador des
lgnate, sought an interview with Sec
retary Lansing. State department offi
cials declined to discuss the matter.
The Mexican embassy stated that the
request had hot been transmitted thru
the ambassador so far as known there.
''It is understood to have been made di
rectly by General Car
ranza thru Spe
cial Agent Rodgers at Mexico City.
Administration, officials today looked
to General Funston to carry out plans
for the redisposition of American
troops in Mexico. The plans approved
by President Wilson and Secretary
Qaker were the outgrowth of confer
'ences between General Funston and
General Scott.
The plans were Interpreted that the
United States will maintain a military
status quo beyond the international
line until the Carranza government has
demonstrated Its ability to exterminate
Villa and bis outlaws. Meanwhile the
American taw* will be so placed as to
guard the American border.
Capture of Lopes Confirmed.
Confirmation of the capture by Car­
(ton troops of Pablo Lopez, Villa's
ehiaf lieutenant, reached the state de

Withdrawal of advanced forces, in
Mexico to the Casas Grandes region is
xegarded by war department officials as
the possible purpose of the redisposition
of tbe troops General Funston has been
authorised to make.
Secretary Baker made it clear that
General Funston bad been given full
discretion and that he was not advised
specifically of the steps to be taken.
Short and Safe Lin*.
Army officers pointed out that the re
tirement suggested would cut the com
munication lines to 100 miles from the
present border base. The shorten line
eould be maintained with ease, they
said, regardless of the use of railroads
or the attitude ot Carranza military
commanders

The American forces would then be
able to tnita care of themselves without
undue risk. They would also be able
to defend border towns.

point is near Parrai 400 miles south of

demonstrate his ability to obtain full
control, to stamp out brlgahdage and if
possible to capture or kill Villa before
a complete withdrawal from Mexico
would be ordered. The presence of the
troops In Mexico probably will have an

Carranza.
Carranza Would G*t Busy.
Some officials believe that if a con

trolled by the American forces is turned

tivity will be taken by the de facto
roVemment.
Mr. Arredondo sought an interview

It is believed Mr. .Arredondo will toe

Garoia Not Satisfied.
The redisposition of American forces
In Mexico With retirement from the
more southern point Is acceptable to
the Mexican people only as a move tow
ard complete wlthdiawa1, according to
Mexican Consul Garcia In El Paac.
"Personally I think the United States
soldiers could do more effective work
by simply patroling their own border."
said Mr. Garcia. "The attack yester
day by Manuel Baca on Santa Tonias
to the rear lines .'Of. the Americans
shows the difficulty of policing this
country."
To Execute Lopez.
Public execution In the plaza at Chi
huahua City Is to end the career of
Pablo Lopez, ,the Villa bandit captured
Saturday near Santa Ysabel, according:
to passengers arriving here from Chi
huahua. A similar fate will be meted
out to the three men taken with Lopez.
The four executions' were set either
for today or tomorrow, the travelers
said. They departed "from Chihuahua
Sunday shortly1 after a special train
left for -Santa Ysabel to bring back the
four prisoners.
Thousands were expected to witness
the executions.
A telegram- received today 'by Gen
eral Gavira, commander of the Juarez
garrison, from General Gutierrez, stated
Lopez had .been absolutely Identified.
Lopez's initials had been found on the
saddle and bridle of his horse, and after
being brought. Into-Chihuahua he was
quickly identified.
Lopez was suffering from hunger. In
the cave where he was found were two

Funston Plan Approved.
"General Funston recommends a re
disposition oif the forces in Mexico for
the purpose of recuperation and pend
ing opportunity for further co-opera
tion with the forces of the de, facto
government at Mexico. His, recom
mendation has- been approved and its
execution left to his discretion."
This was the announcement by
Secretary of War Baker following an
Easter morning conference with the
president on tbe Mexican situation.
Evacuation Is Off.
Before these military recommenda
tions and the recommendations of po
litical advisers who know the coun
try's Idea on the. Mexican situation,
the program of evacuation as ordered
by First Chief carranza has wabfeled
and seems to be abandoned tempo
rarily. Army men are hopeful it will
not be revived before the army men
have had jui opportunity to carry out
the campaign on lines proposed at the
start, but abandoned at the order of
the administration.

No New Troops?
No announcement Is yet made, how
ever, about the prospect of furnish
ing Funston With the additional troops
he requires. In addition to the 14,000
men now over the border there are
some 1-8,000 doing patrol duty. Many
of these Pershing could use to advan
tage, but to do so would have to
be assured that the border was other
wise guarded.
The sudden encouragement given by
the administration to the war depart
ment has enabled the army officers to
regain optimism and resume the cam

"No Withdrawal''—Scott.
San Antonio, Tex., April 24.—Among
the few known facts of the adminis
tration's plana for dealing with the
Mexican situation was the admission
today by Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of
"staff, that he saw "no prospect of the
withdrawal" of American troops.
Altho he h«d intended to leave here
Sunday for Washington, General Soott,
still here last. night, said he did
not know when he would leave. He
added that he had made his report to
Secretary Baker and had received
messages from the war department,
but he gave no Indication of the char
acter either ot We report or of the
communications he had received.
It is not- hl£ intention, he saJd, to go

WILSON DEMANDS
Ambassador Gerard. Cablee Intimation*
That German ^Government Will Go
to Gr*at Lengths to Pre**rv* Friend
ly Relations With United States-
Has Difficult Task in Satisfying
Washington and Radical El*m*nt.
"Washington, April 24.—Confidential
dispatches from Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin indicate that Germany will
make certain concessions to the Unit
ed States in response to the note de
manding the abandonment of present
methods of submarine warfare.
Whether the concessions will be suf
ficiently broad to meet American de
mands was uncertain.
It is understood Ambassador Gerard
has received broad intimations that
the German government will go to
great- lengths to preserve friendly re
lations with the United States. It is!
understood he has gained his lmpres-!
slons from officials of the German for-!
elgn office. Including Foreign Minister
van Jagorw.
The Berlin government is confront
ed with finding a way to sartisfy the
United States without arousing the
element which insists on a relentless
submarine campaign.
(Mr. Gerard's dispatches were highly
confidential.
Seek U. S. Exact Demands.
Before making a formal reply to the
American communication Germany de
sires to know precisely what the Unit
ed States desires. Then, so informed,
she will determine what attitude to
adopt.
The president's demands were
couched in general terms and require
the Imperial government "immediate
ly to declare and effect an abandon
ment of its present submarine war
fare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels."
Germany Insists that she has
warned,"'that she has given passen
gers and crews_ opportunity tq 1qpcape^
before destroying"" ships and that 'ves
sels have-been attacked only when
they have resisted or attempted to es
cape.
Ask End of All Boat WarT
Is It the purpose of the United
States to deprive Germany entirely of
the rig"ht to overhaul vessels and sink
them without reference to the rules of
International law which under speci
fied conditions permit such action? Tf
this be not the purpose of the United
^States, then is it not desirable. In order
that no further misunderstanding may
develop, for President Wilson to state
exactly what rules shall be observed?
In the case of the Sussex, denounced
by the president "as one of the .most
terrible examples of the inhumanity of
submarine warfare," only the facts
were transmitted. What reparation
would be acceptable to the United
States?
Perilous But Hopeful.
'While it is Impossible to learn the
exaot contents of the telegrams which
Ambassador Gerard has sent to the
state department in regard to the
conference he has had with Former
Minister von Jagow, sufficient Is
known to justify the statement that
a frank exchange of views occurred.
The situation Is described as per
ilous, but not hopeless. Anything may
come out of it—a break of relations—
war. But the faot there is discussion
is a sign the significance of which can
not be overestimated.
This discussion is to he conducted
not only in Berlin hut in Washington
as well. Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, has received a
number of code messages. He will call
today upon Secretary Lansing.
Part of the conversation will relate to
the von Igel case: the balance to the
submarine question.
It was learned today that the pro
posed border conference between Gen
eral Scott and General Obregon, Car
ranza's war minister, regarding co-op
