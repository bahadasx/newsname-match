Heady to meet any eventuality,
the American expedition will now
maintain a military status quo
while diplomatic negotiations go
forward at Washington for the
withdrawal of the troops. This

weeks. The pursuit of Francisco
Tilia Is OTer. Thnt Is the belief

eneaee the small wandering bands
of Villa bandits that mam through
northern Chihuahua. These bandi
are widely scattered and operate
in proups of two or three.

tase it will recuperate from the rigors

tion officials todav looked to General

MISSISSIPPI ON A
SECOND RAMPAGE
RlTer Breaks Through Dike at La
Crosse Railroad Tracks Are Wash
ed Away and Land Flooded.
La Crosse, Wis., April 24. Three
hundred feet of the Chicago, Burling
ton & Quincy railroad at East Winona
was carried away by the rise of the
Mississippi river Sunday and a great
sea was hurled upon thousands of
acres of land and farm homes on the
Wisconsin side of the river.
The Burlington embankment has
been the only protection for a large
area since the rise of the river nearly
a month ago. The constant beating of
the river finally wore it away and
Sunday a gap of 60 feet was washed
in the levee and the river fell upon
the lowlands.
At the point of the break the river
was 12 feet above the level of the
land beyond, and the flood poured
through with tremendous force. The
gap was steadily widened today until
It was fully 300 feet across.
Pile drivers were rushed to the
scene as rapidly as possible from the
Burlington and Great Northern roads
and an army of men is at work today
trying to prevent the spread of the
break and to bridge the gap. The
main line of the Burlington system
between Chicago and Minneapolis will
be out of service for three days at
least and perhaps longer. The drain
age district near Trempealeau is un
der water. It was said by Captain W.
A. Thompson of La Crosse, head of the
drainage company, today, however,
that Its damage would not be great.
At La Crosse the river is 12.7 feet
today and is rising slowly. It has
done no great damage here.

Ambassador Cables Presi
dent, Giving Nature of
Berlin Answer.
REPLY IS OUTLINED
Note to Washington Already
Formulated Expected
Middle of Week.
Washington, April 21 Confl.
dentlal dispatches from Ambassa
dor Gerard at Berlin indicate that
Germany may make certain con.
cessions to the United States In
response to the note demanding
the immediate abandonment of
present , methods of submarine
warfare.
Whether the concessions will be
sufficiently broad to meet the
American demands appears uncer
tain. However, officials reflected
an air of hopefulness for an amic
able settlement of the Issue,
The reply itself, it Is believed, will
be presented to the ambassador by
Wednesday or Thursday at the latest
and be laid before President Wilson
by Saturday. This belief was fur
ther strengthened by the receipt of
unofficial advices from Berlin indi
cating that the German government
has decided upon Its reply to the
American note. It was added, how
ever, that the nature of the forth
coming communication was known,
onry to the Highest' officials.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, who has been away on a
week-end trip, was expected to re
turn today. He may call at the stats
department regarding the return of
the papers seized in New York by the
federal authorities from Wolfe von
Igel, former secretary to Captain,
Franz von Papen, former military at
tache of the German embassy.
It is understood Ambassador Gerard
has received broad intimations that
the German government will go to
great lengths to preserve friendly re
lations with the United States. He la
understood to have gained his Impres-,
sions from officials of the Berlin for
eign office, including Foreign Minister
Von Jagow.
The Berlin government is confront
ed with finding a way to satisfy the
United States without arousing the
element which insists upon a relent
less submarine campaign.
Mr. Gerard's dispatches, highly con
fidential in nature, were received dur
ing the night. t
Believe Wilson Will t Budge.
Paris, April 24. The American sit
uation absorbs the press to the exclu
sion of other topics and Secretary
Lansing's note cither tcxtually or in
copious extracts appears in the most
prominent place. All the morning pa
pers in their comments on the note
generally express the belief that Ger
many will try again to play for time,
but that President Wilson, being pro
verbially a man slow in anger, will
not budge an inch from the position
he has taken.
"The German government has cir
culated among neutral nations a semi
official note which commits it to noth
ing," says the Matin. "We learn 'that
the Berlin press Insists on the serious
ness of the situation and that it Is
hoped a solution will be reached com
patible at once with national dignity,
with the rights ot neutrals and the
principles of International law and
not unfavorable to the vital interests
of Germany.'
"That is the wholo program, and
we are curious to see the literary pro
duction which will answer to such
varied requirements."
Says Rupture Is Inevitable.
' A. Fitzmauricc, foreign editor t the
Figaro, writes:
"It only remains for Germany, If
she desires to avoid a rupture, to give
in and humiliate herself. She cannot
do this even did she wish w ithout dan
ger of definitely ruining what little
prestige she still possesses in neu
tral countries and without publicly
admitting she is afraid of the United
States. This would be worse than hu
miliation. It would be defeat for
which Germans would demand a strict
accountability from Dr. Bethmann
Hollweg and the kaiser himself. A
rupture Is inevitable."
