formal announcement ' today that
President Wilson had approved a

its ability to capture or crush Villa

In the interim it is understood the

FLOODS W THE TIGRI8
ARE OBSTRUCTING BRITISH
Last Week's Fighting Was Sorio-is
and of Varying Fortune.
London. April 23. 8.30 p. m. Floods
in the Tigris region are proving a
formidable obstacle to the advance
of the British relief force. General
Gorringe, in another attack this morn
ing on the strong Sannai Tat position
on the north bank of the river, met
the same fate as In a similar attack
on April 9. The British succeeded
in penetrating the second line Turkish
trenches but 'were unable to maintain
the positions gained in the face of a
Turkish counter-attack. Nothing is
said in the Turkish official statement
about the losses but it is feared these
were serious.
Last week's fighting on the south
bank of the river, which also was se
rious and of varying fortune, had
given General Keary's forces an ad
vantage of about two miles and it
had been hoped that this success
would held General Gorringe to break
through on the vlorth bank. Accord
ing to the official despatch General
Keary's forces were una'ole to make
much progress in today's battle.

eastern side of the table land was a
fringe of low bushes, several mil's
long, apparently bordering on the foot
of the eastern mountains. The cav

search and at their further edge came
abruptly upon a canyon, fully a thou
sand feet deep, which shut them off
from the mountains. The mesa and
the surrounding mountains were yol
low with dead grass, awaiting the
coming of spring in the high altitude,
but at the bottom of the canyon lay
a, long valley, brilliant-in the green
of new crops, grrjs and trees in leaf.
A stream ran the length of this val

ting its banks at intervals for miles.
Most cf the canyon sides were lnac

slope every five or ten miles.

Democratic Leaders Face Problem.
I&sldes having a discontented minor.
Iry, democratic leaders face a problem
within their own ranks on the Philip
pine toilL The White House, it is un
derstood, favors the measure as
amended by the senate, to rlv the
Filipinos freedom in four years, but
this does not meet with the united ap
proval of the house democrats. Hence
the plan to make the bill a party meas
ure, which has been seriously discussed,
now seems likely to b aVsindoned.
-Many members smuld like to see the
shipping bill brourr.t in before the
Philippine -measure, -but the leade rs are
not certain that this would be possible.
Another week will be required to finish,

lasts throughout this week, the Philip
pine measure probably will be consid
ered next.
Contest Over Shipping Bill.
Whenever the shipping bill does rornn
Jn, it is certain to precipitate a pro
longed and heated argument. Only a
fw minor changes -will be made in ttie
measure as drawn, it understood,
and Teasel owners are determined to
train their heaviest guns on several
provisions which will be retained, espe
cially those giving the shipping board
power to fix rates snd to permit the
government to purchase ships.

weeks ago. were promised a clear track,
are not moving rapidly to completion.

to conference on the ground that he
had not read it. Chairman Hay of the
military committee expects to see a
rule reported early this week which
will send the measure to conference
promptly.
