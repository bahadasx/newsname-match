FIRST WORD
FROM BERLIN
Ambassador Gerard Re
ports; Kaiser Believed to
Be Seeking a Dignified
Way Out.
By Robert J. Bender
Unite* Pr»u Rtftff C®rre«t>©n4e*t
WASHINGTON. April 24 -Official information today
indicate* German official* do want a break with the
United States. But they are in a quandary a* to how simul
taneously to meet the American submarine demands and
the popular German desire for continr nee oi the undersea
warfare at this time.
The United Press learned these facts today from a high
official. Advices from Berlin described the situation as sim
ilar to that indicated by the United Pres* intervhrew with
Admiral Von Holtzendorff, who said Germany could not
>4Sake further concessions to America, but positively did not
want a diplomatic break. (
Aothorities here think Germany will find a way to make
the concessions.
There has been no report from Ambassador Gerard as
to when the German reply may be expected. The authori
ties promised it "as early as possible."
President Wilson notified Sen. Stone to confer with him
ea developments in the German situation Wednesday
evening:.
A message from Ambassador Gerard was received dur
ing the night.
It is thought possible Gerard may have forwarded Ger
many's tentative proposals seeking light as to how they
would be received if embodied in a formal communication
Gerard will be advised to reject anything short of com
pliance with the American demand that the submarining of
merchantmen cease until new methods for conducting such
a warfare are devised and ratified by the United States.
