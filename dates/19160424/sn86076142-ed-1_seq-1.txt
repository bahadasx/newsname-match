PEKING, Apr. 24 Dr. Nagao Ariga.
the Japanese constitutional adviser to
the Chinese government, is practical
s man without a country.
Since Dr. Ariga addressed Yuan Shi
Kal as "Your Majesty" in a document
l,dely printed in the Chinese press
supporting the monarchical movement,
.lr. Ariga has been ostracized by his
iellow-rountrymun residing In China,
and mercilessly attacked by the press
In Japan. This action of Dr. Ariga.
at a time when bis country was op
posing the Chinese monarchy, has
been regarded as little short of trea
son by his fellow-countrymen. He was
forced to resign from the Japanese
club In Peking, and is no longer wel-i
come in the homes of the leading
Japanese In this city. It has been fre
quently suggested to him through the
press that he should surrender his
Japanese citizenship and become a
Chinese subject.
, Dr. Ariga Is one of the favorite ad
visers of Yuan Shi Kai, and in both
China and Japan he Is regarded as the
foremost authority on constitutional
law in the Orient. He Is now busily
engaged in assisting with the new
Chinese officials connected with the
constitution drafting committee. Dr.
Ariga Is a graduate of Toklo Univer
sity, and was In charge of affairs relat
ing to International law during Ihe
China Japanese war. He was formerly
a professor at Waseda University, but
has been forced out of that Institution
because of his work In China..

Albion Bradbury Millett, pioneer of!
Smoky Valley and one of the best
known nu n In Nevada died in Los
Angeles Sunday morning from the ef
lects of injuries received in a trol
ley car accident two days before. In
terment will be at Oakland. He was
C! years of age, leaves a widow, an
adopted daughter, Miss Lottie Dan
iels, and a niece, twelve years of age
living at Pablo Canyon, in Smoky
Valley.
The deceased was known as one
of the wealthiest men of the southern
country and one who never refused a
favor to any applicant. He was ener
getic and progressive and through
thrift and industry established one of
the largest and most lucrative ranches
In Smoky Valley, Although not as well
known as others of the earlv comers
to the state those who knew him knew
him as a friend who could be relied
upon, as staunch and true as ever
was moulded in the form of man. His
business consisted of one of the lars
est stork ranches, a mercantile estal)
lishment that supplied the entire
northern end of the county and min
ing interests that added materially to
a sunriantial fortune.
Mr. Millett was born In Maine and
came to Nevada in 1876 when he set
tled In the section made famous by
his development and established the
town bearing his name. Soon after
he married Mrs. Christina Shields. He
always took an active part In public
matters and was elected from Nye
state senate. At both sessions, Mr.
Millett was prominent in committer
work and on the floor made his in
flueufe felt to a remaiKable degree.
During t'.ie famous rush to the
northern section of the county the
town of Millett was founded and a
mill built and at present great develop
ments are in progress.
As soon as the first news of the
accident In Los Angeles was received
word was conveyed to Mrs. Millett at
the home ranch and the wife and brother-in-law
. immediately started for
the bedside arriving there yesterday
morning. Miss Mue McLeod a daugh
ter of Mrs. Annie McLeod, a sister of
the widow arrived from Millett yes
terday and took the first train for
Oakland where the funeral will be
held. Mrs. Millett has another sister,
Mrs. Phillip Meyer, living in Elko. She
Is well known here having formerly
lived in Manhattan.
One of the chief mourners will be
Miss Lottie Daniels, daughter of the
late Jesse Daniels of Kingston Can
yon and the only daughter of the fam
Ily who was taken into the Millett
home on the death of her mother who.
while on her deathbed, sent an Indian
messenger to t he Millett ranch with
a request for Mr. and Mrs. Millett to
come and see here before she passed
away. The invalid was perturbed by
the face that her only daughter would
be left without a home and she-asked
Ihe Milletts to look after the orphaned
child. Since that date Miss Daniels
has been recognized and treated as
