RISEN CHRIST
EASTER TOPIC
CRUSH
Dr. WILLIAMS PREACHED MOST
POWERFUL SERMON OF THE
SERIES YESTERDAY TO LARGE
CROWD.
The big tabernacle at the corner
of C and Broadway, N. W., was filled
with people at 11 o'clock yesterday
morning to hear Dr. Williams' Easter
sermon on the subject of "The Fact
of Christ, and Is He Risen?" The
special Easter music was very ap
propriate, and was rendered by a
chorus of about three hundred.
Although the storm arose at church
time last night, about 1,500 people
attended the meeting and Dr. Wil
liams preached a sermon to back
sliders. The evangelist announced
last night that during this week dif
ferent delegations would attend the
services at different times. Tomor
row night is to be Methodist night,
and all Methodists of the city are
expected to meet at the Broadway
M. E. church and march to the taber
nacle in a body, where they will find
pew reservations for their use. Wed
nesday night is Baptist night, and ail
the Baptists of the city will meet at
the Broadway Baptist church and in
a body will proceed to the taber
nacle, whore a section will be reserv
ed for Baptists. Thursday night all
members of the Christian church in
the city will meet at the First Chris
tian church and go to the tabarnacle
in a body, where they will find a sec
tion of seats reserved for them.
These church delegations Pill foira
at the respective places, not later
than 7:30 of the evening the aro to
meet, so that no delay will be had
at the tabernacle. Dr. C. C. Weith,
of the First Presbyterian church, is
compelled to be out of the city a
great part of the time this week,
therefore the Presbyterian delegation
will observe their time at the taber
nacle Tuesday night of next week,
when all Presbyterians of the city
will meet at the First Presbyterian
church and go to the tabernacle in
a body.
Next Saturday night the Boy
Scouts and Campfire Girls of the
city are invited to meet and come to
the tabernacle in a body and occupy
a reserved section at the tabernacle.
In his Easter morning sermon Dr.
Williams made a strong argument on
the proof of the facts of Jesus Christ
and the fact that He was risen from
the dead. Space will permit us to
give only excerpts from his wonderful
address, and following is a part of
what. he said:
"There never was a greater pro
pbery or a greater miracle than the
prophecy of rhri ;. and its fulfillment
to date when He said: 'Heaven and
earth shall pa?3 away, hut my word
shall not pass away.' How is it to b?
preserved? In His day speeches were
neither iri&tcd nor reported. Was
ever such audacity seen or heard of?
What did He mean by that saying?
He stood on the hillside of Judea and
looked - out upon the plains below,
dotted with cities and towns. He
stood between two of the mightiest

CONCESSIONS
FROM GERMANY
AMBASSADOR GERARD ADVISES
STATE DEPARTMENT TO THAT
EFFECT.
Announcement from Gerard Gives Of
ficials at Washington More Hope for
Amicable Settlement of Differences
with Germany.
Washington, D. C, April 24. Confi
dential advices from Ambassador Ge
rard at Berlin today" indicate that
Germany is willing to make certain
concessions to the United States note.
Whether these concessions will be
sufficiently broad to meet the Ameri
can demands appears uncertain. How
ever, Washington officials reflected
an air of hopefulness for amicable set
tlement. German Position Agreed Upon.
Berlin, April 24. The imperial chan
cellor, Dr. von Bethmann-HoUweg, re
turned to Berlin Sunday afternoon,
which would seem to justify the as
sumption that the empire's responsi
ble leaders at German headquarters
have finished consideration of the
American note and reached a decision
concerning Germany's reply.
What this reply will be is naturally
unknown to any but the highest of
ficials. The chancellor's return, it is under
stood, was not expected until Tues
day, hence a general decision appears
to have been reached earlier than
looked for. There is no intimation of
when the reply will be formulated, hut
there seems to be much significance in
the fact that the Lokal Anzeiger which
is consistently well informed, says that
German's strength and prestige have
so increased in the last twenty months
in the eyes of the whole world, that
the German government has indeed
only to follow the commands of wis
dom. The obvious deduction, according to
the view here, is that there is nothing
to prevent Germany from making cer
tain concessions, if the leaders feel
that they can properly do so. Wheth
er they do feel that they can go thus
far is, of course, another question.
There is unquestionably a consider
able peace party in Germany, which
includes powerful financial interests
represented by the Borse organ and
the Frankfurter Zeitung and including
also the Berlin Tageblatt and socialist
organs. High officials also would con
sent to a breach or war with the Unit
ed States only most. reluctantly and
under pressure of what seems to them
an unavoidable necessity.
It may be not without significance
that Maximilian Harden was permitted
to print a remarkable article in his
paper, Zukunft, defending President
Wilson's standpoint in plain words. .

BORDER OFFICIALS, HOWEVER,

NEGROES ARE KILLED
Report of Battle, Reaching El Paso,
Says Several Negro Soldiers Were
Killed in the Fight El Paso Polico
Do Not Believe It.
El I'aso, Tex., April 21. Early to
day the police had a report that fight
ing had begun between the United
States soldiers and the Carrancistas
at Satevo. The police believe the
report is untrue. It included the in
formation that several negro soldiers
had been killed.
The report that the Americans and
Carrancistas had been engaged in
battle at Satevo and that several ne
gro soldiers had been killed, is not
credited by army officers hero.
SO
F0R0NEDOLLAR
TH I RTY-FIVE
BUT JURY THOUGHT DIFFERENT
LY FROM PLAINTIFF AND RE
URNS VERDICT IN FAVOR OF
RAILROAD.
Rather a peculiar case was tried in
Justice Cannon's court Saturday,
which shows that the sentiment in
regard to railroads has undergone a
marked change in this locality within
the past year, and that a jury sitting
on a case henceforth will be devoid
of prejudice against transportation
companies simply because they are
railroads.
The case was that of the Tauls
Valley Milling company vs. the Santa
Fe Railroad company. The milling
company filed suit for $1.35, an al
leged overcharge on freight. The
milling company, through the local
freight adjusters, Phelan & company,
was represented by O. C. Lasher as
attorney, while W. D. Potter, local
attorney for the Santa Fe, represent
ed the railroad.
The railway demanded a Jury,
which was empanelled and the case
tried. In arguing the case, Attorney
Potter cited the fact that the Santa
Fe had paid over one million dollars
to citizens of this city for damages
caused by the rceent explosion and
asked the jury if in its opinion the
company owed $1.35 they would re
fuse to pay it. The jury evidently
thought that the Santa Fe would pay
any just claim without litigation, as
they were out about two minutes
when they returned with a verdict
in favor of the railroad company. The
case is ended, as it is not appealable.
