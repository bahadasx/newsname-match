WHISKERS
Jim Robinson, commissioner from
the Chickasha district, has taiieu a
victim to the wiles of the barber.
Jim has always argued that he could
out-talk any kind of talking machin
ery, human or graplionelic, bit,
like the pitcher that went once too of
ten to the well and wa broken, Jim
tinkled the conversation game once
too often and lost out. He tried swap
ping conversation with a barber Sat
urday and when the knight of the
scissors and lather pot finished with
him, he had lost by the adverse score
of K.o to 3, with his whiskers thrown
In.
The distinguished commissioner, of
tho former distinguished whiskers,
steadfastly refuses to be interviewed
on the "whiskers" subject. He will
neither deny or affirm the allegation
that armed with his whiskers he so
closely resembled Carranza that he
was afraid to leave home; he will
neither affinn nor deny the rumor
that fond admirers, of both sex fac
tions, urged upon him that he would
be better looking bereft of all his hir
sute adornment except the Buffalo-
Bill moustache which the bartier inad
vertently overlooked; he will neither
affirm nor deny the report circulated
generally that he cut his whiskers off
because a family of trained bumble
bees, residing on the Robinson farm,
insisted upon taking up, therein, sum
mer quarters; he will neither deny or
affirm the libelous report which has
gained currency that when the barber
invaded and explored the recesses of
the whisker wilderness he unearthed
and brought to light Jim's favorite
whetstone which was misplaced three
years ago last July, right in the midst
of the haying season.
But, even though the gentleman
may refuse to be interviewed upon the
subject until he turns black In the
face, the fact remains that one of the
best single-handed talkers in the tou-
sorial profession, out-debated Jim and
gnt his whiskers.
No mattress factories making bids
for them, the amputated whiskers
were turned over to a squadron of
English sparrows, and will be used by
thptu In upholstering the several mil
lion nests which thew are at present
erecting in and about Chickasha.

forces in the state of Sonora and re
sultant border raids.

of troops as now proposed contetu-
:'ates this angle and is calculated to
ih v, art such attempts.

leave here for Eagle l'ass to hold a
conference there with Mexican War
Minister Obregon, according to reports
In military circles, which are partly
confirmed by Funston. Gen. Scott re

tration and redistribution of American
troops would, continue, pending the re
sult of the meeting. Funston received
a detailed report, giving Villa's loca
tion and stating that Villa was slight
ly wounded.

By United Press. '
Berlin, April 24. Tho German reply!
to the last American note regarding
submarine operations is reported to
have been outlined In a dispatch)
which Ambassador Gerard sent to.
President Wilson, following a confer
ence with Secretary von Stumtn of tha
foreign office and Doctor Hccksger o '
the reichstag foreign relations, com
uiittee.
No intimation as to the text of thqj
reply are given but officials here gen
erally are hopeful that there will b
no breach in tho relations between
Germany nd the United States gov
ernment.
Silence is also maintained regard
ing the conference of. Chancellor Beth
maun von Hollweg with the kaiser but
they evidently reached a decision as)
to the course that Germany will fol
low. The conference was also attend
ed by Chief of Staff Falkenhayn.
The peaceful sentiment of the press
and the fact that many Germans for
merly favoring an unyielding policy,
now counsel concessions are taken to
Indicate that a way will be found for
compliance with the demands made
in President Wilson's note, without;
loss ot honor.
Ambassador Gerard held a confer
ence with Chancellor von Hollweg this
morning but neither had anything to
give out concerning what was said.
There is unquestionably a consider
able peace party in Germany which in
cludes powerful financial interests
represented by the Bourse organs and
the Frankfurter Zeitung and including
also the Berlin Tageblatt and social
ist organs. Certain high officials also
woulcf consent to a breach or war with,
the United States only most reluctant
ly and under pressure of what seems
to them an unavoidable situation. It
may not bo without significance that
Maximillian Harden was permitted to
print a remarkable article in, his pa-,
per, Zukunft, defending President Wil
son's standpoint in plain words. '.
With the possible exception of al
handful of extremists there appears;
to be nobody in Germany desirous ot
a breach or war with tha United
States. It is evident bevond d
however, that if the government
should reject the demands of thai
American note it would find the unit
j ed support of Germans of all parties.
J Even those to whom the idea of 4
rupture between Germany and the
United States is most distasteful agreci
in feeling that the government muse
refuse to weaken its means of warring?
against Great Britain even though)
this should mean a breach with thi
United States.
A faint note of optimism Is soundej
by the Vorwaerts, the organ of the so
eal democrat party, but other paper
speak openly of an unavoirabl,
'jreach. A striking feature in connec
tion with the whole matter Is the fact
thai the press almost unanimously
speaks of "Wilson's note" and only li
exceptional cases as the "American
note." Most papers disregard report
showing that congress is supporting
