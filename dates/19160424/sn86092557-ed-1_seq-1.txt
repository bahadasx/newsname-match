- Details or the plans and specifica
tions for the construction of the new j
Arcade professional building to be
built by the Fairmont Building and In- j
vestment company are rapidly being
completed by Architect A. C. Lyons j
and,it is thought that the proposition |
will be ready for construction bids in
about two weeks. With the develop
ment of the plans many new and in
teresting features of the buildiug have
come to light and the completion of
thistproject will give Fairmont one 01
ilfejmdst complete and desirable build
ings" for the offices of professional
menfln West Virginia..
; The plans call tor a five-story build-1
Jng?;''constructed of pressed brick,
fronting on Cleveland avenue, on the
a it el of what is now known as the Man-1
ley^property und adjoining the Arnett |
property which is next to South Siue !
bridge. From the front the building
Jwlll be a handsome appearing struc
ture with the main entrance in the
center. Two other entrances will lead
from the sidewalk into two long store
rooms at either side of the building.
These will be well lighted from the j
side, front and rear and will De 20 feet j
wide aim 72 feet in length.
Unon entering the main entrance lo i
g the Arcade six smaiier auop ruums,
bjthree oh either side, will be seon. ISach
po? these will have entrances from the
^arcade and the entire front of each
will l>e plate glass display windows.
The arcade itself will be lighted from
the- skylights overhead and will pro
vider easy access to the elevator, which
isjpto be on the right-hand side com
ihgk-from tho street entrance. This
arcade will be paved with tile as
areVthe other first floor rooms. The
stairway will ascend around the cle
avtoir shaft to the roof.
fo r of the upper stories will
have'S similar construction, anil will
have twenty-five ofllce rooms each,
with ' a wide airshaft extending from
theTskylights over the first floor arcade
toTthe roof. Thus each of tho two rows
ofofficea on either side of tho airshaft
will-be outside rooms with sunlight
and; plenty of outsido ventilation. A
liallway will oxtend between the two
rows of offices making each of them of
access and but a short distance from
"the elevator and stairway. All of
the.iconstruction in the building will
ibe-fireproof and modern.
J A feature of the office room con
struction will be the partitions which
iare to be of hollow tile making oach
room soundproof. Each room will
have both hot and cold water in addi
ction to four tollot rooms on each floor,
ftll of the floors in the four upper stor
ics will be of concrete and steel con
struction with a noiseproof surface.
.The {elevator, operated by electricity,
iwill.iin conformation to the latest Ideas
'of engineering science, have the motor
that? runs tho apparatus located over
head at the top or the shaft.
fijrCJrider the entire building a com
modlus basement will be built with
separate compartments for oach of the
store and shop rooms on the arcade
floor. Tn tho basement will also be lo
cated the vacuum steam-heating ar
rangements with which the entire
building will bo heated. In tho rear
ofijthe basement and easily reached
from tho wido stairway opening on
tojthVdriveway and parking space for
automobiles, which is in the rear of
thejhuildlng. will be a largo and well
lighjed packing room for the opening
otjbokos and shipments of goods deliv
ered to the shops.
J*?A's all of the offices in the building
arejto bo so constructed that two or
Scire can he Joined with connecting
doors, suites of as many rooms bb
theJtennants may desire can bo pro
vided. Already a great many of tho
100; office rooms have been asked for
by, Physicians and dentists about the
pity, and it is likely that the majority
of; the entire building will be engaged
by,.Prospective tenants before the con
struction Is completed. Located in
the most desirable section of the town
and near the heart of the business dls
trlct-the building will yet be nniet and
most suitable for professional pur
poses
?J[The residence which is now upon
pieif'site of tho new Arcade building
will be moved to tho lot in the rear and
jpllllhe turned so that it fronts toward
tlie.South Side bridge. The new bulld
Swlll be comploted and ready for

168 CONVERTS II
TAYLOR MEETINGS
Revival Services at Central
Christian Church Brought
to a Close.
The great revival at the Christian
church came to a close Sunday night.
Twenty converts were niude at last
Sunday's meeting; 40 during ilie week
and 168 during the meetings. The clos
ing week was the greatest in additions
of any week during the entire cam
paign and in interest ami number of
conversions, warranted the meeting
going on indefinitely but. future plans
both of the church and the evangelist
made continuing the meeting impossi
ble.
The attendunue Sunday niglu taxed j
all the auditorium unci galleries of the
new church. The unceasing record
breaking crowds during the entire live..
weeks of the revival campaign has
been phenomenal.
Dr. Taylor who has-been assisting;
Dr. Mitchell, the pastor of the church, j
has proved himself one of the most, j
successful evangelists who has ever J
visited Fairmont. His preaching has ;
been kind, scholary and absolutely J
free from sensationalism, lie has1
proved that a sensation can he pro- j
duced without restoring to sensational i
methods, lie was supported by Prof, j
Leigh and Prof. Adams as musical di- \
roctors, whose services added great- j
ly to the results secured. Hack of the
evangelists was a united church thor
oughly organized by Dr. Mitchell who
himself has had wide experience in
evangelistic work. Dr. Mitchell in
two years' time,, has led a church out
of discouragement and without a suit
able church home, to a glorious victory
housing them in one of the finest and
most up-to-date church properties with
new parsonage, in our city.
At the services last night communi
cations and congratulations were ex
changed between pastor and church
and the evangelistic party,.as mutual
tributes of respect for tho good fel
lowship on joyed and the great, results
achieved. Tho farewell prayers were
offored by Dr. Taylor and Dr. Mitchell.
Dr. Taylor's sermon last night was
a parting message, his theme that of
"The Christian Race." It was a fine
discourse enjoining: upon all to re
main faithful in the Christian life un
til the "day is done and the crown
won." In a moat fitting manner the
greatest meeting ever held by a sin
gle church in Fairmont camo to its
close.

It Provides Penalties And
Conforms With State
Law.
Xot fearing that West Virginia will
ever fro wci again, but taking; all ne
cessary precautions, Mayor Ant.iony
iiowcti lias introduced a liquor prohi
bition ordinance affecting conditions
peculiar to Fairmont.
This ordinance which it took City
Clerk Albert Kern several minutes
to read to the Board of A flairs this
morning, is patterned after the statu
law and is approximately the same
as ordinances lately introduced in
other cities in West Virginia. The or
dinance was read to the Board of
Affairs in session this morning in the ;
board meeting room and was passed '
over for itn second reading which will \
be next Monday.
The license tax ordinance, which \
was also introduced to Hie board at j
the meeting this morning, was passed
to its socond reading, hut not until af- ,
t.er ?ho tax on automobiles was
brought down from $5 to $1. This was !
done when a very forcible argument!
was made by representatives of the!
Fairmont Automobile'club, who np-i
pea red for the purpose of voicing their !
claims. The club was represented by j
W. A. Ucdebuseh, Sam 13. Iseman.j
Wilbur IJriiTius and Basil Layman. I
The board, upon hearing the condi-j
tions under which automobilists must
run their cars in this city and coun
try, were very willing to reduce the
proposed tax from $5. to the rate
which it is at present, or $1.
The report that there will;he 500
cars in Fairmont by the first day of
July will be watched from day to day
and should such great gains be made,
it is very likely that the price will
be further reduced. With 500 cars in
Fairmont, the city would be netted
$2,000 yearly for license plates and
for a traffic cop at Jefferson street
corner.
J. W. Snowden appeared before the
board and asked that water and sewer
linos be extended to several houses
belonging to him. on Pittsburgh ave
nue. This was referred to Water Com
missioner Ira Smith.
.Commissioner Albert Lehman was
ordered to purchase red and green
lights to be placed under the Madison
street bridge. This War Department
order, which was put into effect many
years ago had gradually passed into
disuse. A complaint was made to the
War department at Washington about
it and the War department acted with
the foregoing result.
The same commissioner was also in
structed to purchaso an iron grating
for the floor of the new city jail.
Water Commissioner Ira L. Smith
was asked to prepare a plan for the
care of seepage from the filter teds
at the reservoir. He will report on the
work next Monday.
James A. Knight, recently elected
electrical inspector of the city,' tool*
oath of office last week. The necessary
report was made to the board today.
Lawronce J. Horan, elected city as
sessor, also took his oath of office last
wonts wWfl in the city for a few days.
DR.C.A.SINSEL
NBHf
Taylor County Men Entitled
to the Nomination This
Year.
[ Dr. Charles A.'Sinsel, of Grafton, is
a candidate for the nomination of
state Senator on the Republican ticket
from the Eleventh Senatorial district
of West Virginia, comprising Marion,
Monongalia and Taylor counties. It
was announced from the Taylor county
metropolis a few days ago that I Jr.
Sinsel would be in the race. The three
counties have as a rule taken turns
in getting the nominataion for Stale
! Senator. Marion conuty had the nomi
nation at the last election, and Mon
ongalia had the call on the two prevl
I oils compaigns. so Hint there is no
I disputing the claim of Taylor county
to the right for the candidate at the
coming campaign. .
! Dr. Charles A. Sinsel is a son of
Arthur Sinsel. one of the best known
Republicans of Taylor county in liis
day. He is about 45 years of age and
li?s had a wide range of experience
in public; life. He graduated from the
llrnfton public schools. Granville col
Ickc and Jefferson Medical college. He
lias always been n great supporter of
public schools and was a member of
the Board of lOducation of Grafton for
many years. He-is a member of thu
Oaptist church and a Free. Mason.
That Dr. Sinsel is a strong candi
date is shown by the fact that he was
tho only Republican elected ii* Taylor
county two years ago, when he was
darted to the House of Delegates by a
majority of nearly. 200. Dr. Sinsel is
wel known and well liked in the Mar
ion and Monongalia counties aB woll
as in Taylor county. Captain Hatfield
will likely be the Democrat to run
against Dr. Sinsod. and the friends of
the Taylor county man are confident
that he will make'tho sage of Mor
gantown step lively to stay ia the race.
New Front For

An entire new story ls to. be added
to the structure and at least six now
office rooms wll- thus be built. Tho
front construction of the building will
be changed from the beginning, ot, the
second story and tho appearance of
,tlia entire structure will thus bo mod
cfrhlftedtfttid. beantiflod-to conform <
the latest ideas of office buildings. I
A space will be left in the rear of j
the present stairway that can be ui i-!
lized in tbe future for an elevator if j

morning at 7 o'clock and continued j
throughout the evening until the last !
pedestrian had left the streets. De- i
spite the cold they kept at it nnd
