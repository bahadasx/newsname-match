Wilsonfs Policy
Flayed by Burton
in Address Here
CANDIDATE FOR ' O. P. NOMI
NATION FOR PRESIDENT
MAKES ATTACK.
In an open air address to several
hundred people at the Happy Canyon
pavilion Saturday afternoon, Theodore
E. Burton of Ohio, candidate for the
republican noEssnstlon for president,
devoted hi ore attention to the
foreign policy -of President Wilon,
condemning the president's attitude
with reference to Mexico and Ger
many. The speaker often dwelt In sarcas
tic or sneering; manner upon the ac
tions of the administration. He In
sisted a mistake was made when rec
ognition was refused to Huerta who
was classed as having maintained the
most responsible government in Mexi
co in recent years. Senator Burton
declared the taking of Vera Crux by
the United States had accomplished
nothing.
Upon the European situation the
senator emphatically condemned the
administration's policy toward Ger
many. Though holding that the re
cent ultimatum to Germany was right
In tone he Insisted such action should
have been taken sooner.
In hi talk the senator refrained en
tirely from any discussion of economic
subject and did not dwell on the fil
ibuster that brought about the de
feat of the administration's shipping
bill a year ago.
Following the talk by Senator Bur.
ton, a 15 minute address was made by
ex-rCongressman Cole of Ohio, who is
accompanying Senator Burton. Mr
Cole also condemned the Wilson for
eign policy, classing the president as
the Buchanan of the present day,
rather than the modern day Lincoln.
Both speakers were introduced to
the audience by Captain C. A. Mur
phy of the local Young Men's and
Young Women's Republican Club.
Senator Burton was frequently ap
plauded but the enthusiasm shown
was not vociferous.

I According to a statement of the
mayor this mornuing, he caused the
arrest of Gibson because the latter
practically dared him to do so. The

dancers, the managers of the dance
had posted up signs stating that "rag

that In the one-step or walk-dance nor
more than eight steps may be taken
without a pivot.
Mayor Best charges that Gibson
guided his partner entirely around
the hall without turning, despite
warnings given him. He states that
when he and Officer Nash cautioned

arrest him if he was violating the
law. "I told Nash to take him to the
