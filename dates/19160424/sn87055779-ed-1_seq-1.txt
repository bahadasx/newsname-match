Numerous clashes occurred today
when 40 deputies fuardin the Käst
Pittsburgh plant of the Westing
house Electric and Mfg. Co.. where
16.000 men and women are on strike.
Attempted to disperse great crowds
that gathered around the entrances.
The deputies were roughly handled
and many were fjioed to use their
clubs to protect themselves.
When the doors to th plunt were
opened today tbe strii ei-s again
linked h.nds. forming a human
chain about the entrances. Th
chain the deputies once succeeded in
breaking, but it was re-formed and
further attempts to sever it up to
the time the doors were closed were
futile.
All saloons in En.st Pittsburgh are
closed today at the request of the
authorities and the strike leaders.
An effort is being made to prevent
the shipment of liquor into the
borough.
Fred H. Merrick, one of the, strike
leaders, in an address to the strikers
today advised them to arm them
selves. He safd he had learned the
company intended bringing the state
constabulary "the cossacks," he
called them. Blue steel revolvers, he
said, would not flash so much and
would ' harder to detect. "And get

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY
DOESN'T COVER CRIMES
Atty. Gen. Gregory Rules Em
bassy Officials Cannot Es

1 o
Criminal Activity.
IntcrnatloniM News Servke:
WASHINGTON. April 2 4.
Atty. Gen. Gregory today ruled
that diplomatic immunity from
arrest does not extend to cases
in which a diplomat is guilty of
criminal offenses against the
government of the United States.
The ruling was made at the re
quest of department of justice
officials who are handling the
case of Wolf von Igel, arrested
on charges of being involved in
the plot to destroy th Welland
canal.
International News Service:
WASI II N TON. April 24. The
United States is taking no chances on
being cauirht napping either in in
ternational affairs or in Mexico.
While officials are hoping that Ger
many will decid to accept the
American viewpoint regarding her
conduct of submarine warfare
against mere1" ships and that the
new eomplka. a in Mexico may be
adjusted without further recourse to
arms, the activity in army and navy
circles is growing increasingly fever
ish. Today leaves of absence of 4 3
naval officers were cancelled hy di
rect orders of Sec'y Daniel. At the
same time instructions were issued
that no additional applications for
leaves will be considered at this
time. Leaves to army officers were
cancelled last week and all the
commissioned personnel of both tlie
army and the navy are under orders
to report to regiments or ships. In
addition the two departments are in
touch with all retired officer so
that in case of need they can he
called to ac tive service immediately.
No Definite Information.
There is no definite information
obtainable regarding the German
submarine situation. Ambassador
Gerard has communicated to Sec'y
Lansing all of the information i.e
has been able to secure, but it is ad
mitted that it is still far from defin
ite. Messages received here today
are understood to refer to confer
ences which the ambassador held on
Sunday with attaches of the foreign
office, but ho far he has failed to
send any information regarding his
conference with the imperial chan
cellor. Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg.
The feeling In official circles natur
ally is hepeful because of the belief
that If she so desires, Germany can
extend her regulations governing
her Mediterranean warfare to the
Anglo-French naval war zone and
thus met the views of the United
States.
It is authoritatively m de plain
that If Germany will meet the vi.vs
of the United States relative to
curbing the actions of her submarine
commanders she will find that the
United States will meet her half way
In negotiations that must follow for
the purpose of determining Just
what is and what is not legal In sub
marine warfare.
Orders Iaiers HctiirneI.
In addition it is Intimated in of
ficial circles that there will be no at
tempt made to inject any foreign
matter into the situation by this
government. Confirmation of this
fact was seen today in the orders
sent by f'ec'y Lansing to Atty. Cen.
Gregory that "all official papers"
seized in the arrest of Wolf von Iirel
in New York are to be turned back
to Ambassador von Bernstorff. While t
this raises the question of what are!
official papers, which must he set- j
tied when the ambassador returns j
here tonight, the admission that of- .
f.cial papers cannot be seize.-j js ex-
pected to make the incidents in con-
nectlon with von Igel s arrest much
less serlcus than they have hereto
fore appeared.
All the von Ierel papers were snt
to Sec'y Lansing, who Is personally
said to have charge of the delivery
to Ambafisador von Bernstorff.
The ambassador lias said inform
ally that he would not mak? eW
tlon fr"m the papers, but would ex
pect the return of all of thm as
being "embassy property."
