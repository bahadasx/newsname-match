'Uncertain, it is understood, whether they go Tar enough to. meet the

of the note was received by the German press precluded extended

immediately announced the German intention hot to agree to the
American terms. 4
"The German nation is thoroughly united in a firm resolve not
to let the submarines, the weapons of necessity, be wrenched from
our hands," says this paper. "We will continue to use them as we
have, according to the principle of justice and of humanity. "Wo
will continue to use them h the, future as in the past, because tho
yeryexistence of the state and the future of our wives and children
are at stake and compel us to strike where we are able."
