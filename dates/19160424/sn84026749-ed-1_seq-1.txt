A giant merger of the street car
and interurban electric railway!,
centering in Washington is in proc
ess of negotiation, it developed to
day. ' The merger, which in the present.
instance is being sought by the
Fidelity trust Company, of Balti
more, is understood to be a revival
of the plans under which the Wash
ington Utilities Company originally
vts formed.
It would embrace a consolidation
of the Washington Railway and
Electric Company, the Potomac
Electric Power Company, the Capi
tal Traction Company, the Wash
ington and Old Dominion Railway,
the Washington Utilities Company
line, the Georgetown and Tenley
town, the Washington and Rock
vijle and other subsidiaries of the
Washington Railway and Electric.
MAY INCliUDE W. B. AND A.
TheTctlra participation In the nego
tiation" of George T. Bishop, tbe Cleve
land street railway magnate, has led to
the understanding that the Washington,
IUItlrriore and Annapolis railway, which
already la In process oC mercer with the
Annapolis Short Line, may be Involved.
The Annapolis Short Line la controlled
by Alexander Brown & Sons, the Balti
more bankers.
Unwillingness on the part of the
stockholders of the other lines proposed
In the consolidation to accept the stock
of the Washington nallway and Elec
tric into the merger at the price de
manded Is said to have caused a hitch
Which has temporarily at least brought
the negotiations to a standstill. More
than 1100,000.000 Is the figure at which
the capitalization of the proposed merger
Is said to have been placed.
How Negotiations Started.
The negotiations. It was learned today,
Brew out of arrangements which were
undertaken to provide for the retire
ment or refunding of an Issue of Jl, 600.000
one-year 5 per cent collateral trust notes
of the Washington Utilities Company,
which were purchased by the Fidelity
Trust Company of Baltimore and ma
ture on May 1 of this year.
These notes are amply secured, and
tho negotiations were In no sense In
spired by any apprehension on that
core. On the contrary the surplus In

PITTSBURGH. Pa.. April Ci.-Elghty-slx
manufacturers of munitions for na
tions at war In Europe threw down the
gauntlet to their employes today. In
Dig half-page advertisements In the
Pittsburgh newspapers, they stated flat
ly that no reduction in hours will be
i granted.
' Among the signers were three West
inchouio concerns, one of which, the
tVoatliirrhnu.n Klrfrln and Mauufaclur-
Ing Compahy, at East Pittsburgh, li
nariy tied oy a siriKO or jj.w; or its
18,000 workers. Other subscribers to
the statement were the Union Switch
and Signal Company the Mesta Match
Company, and the Braddock Machine
Company.
This was the first Intimation from
the employers that they recognized ef
forts to brlnsr about a big general strike
for union recognition and the eight-hour
day in the unorganized steel nnd allied
plants.
Rumors that such a movement was
on foot were rife Saturday, and were
credited to union leaders. They could
not be confirmed from any reliable
source, though generally given cre
dence. Armies of pickets were thrown about
, the East Pittsburgh, Wllmerdlng and
Turt Creek plants of the Westing
house concerns when the llrst shifts be
gan to report today,

the 15.000 workors to ally themselves

Clubs were freelv used by' a force of
forty deputies during tho morning In a

The strikers were out In force. Fully

RUING

U-BOATS ABANDON "EYES"
RELY ON SOUND IN FIRING
BERNE, April 22 (dclaycd). German submarines have aban
doned the periscope in most", instances and are now shooting
without looking,-according to reports current in Berne. Tho
torpedoes are now fired by sound alone.
During the past twenty sinkings in British .waters, no one has seen
a submarine, and in but few cases has the w"hite wake of the
torpedo been observed. Only the discovery of bronze bits of
torpedoes or tho nature of the explosion has offered proof that
the ships were submarine victims. If the pcriscopcless sub
marine is a success, survivors of torpedoed ships never again
will be able to say: "We saw the trail of the periscope in the
water.' '
The new perlscopeless submarine, as it Is described in Switzerland,'
has a great steel disk for an ear, on either side of the boat.
Telephone receivers, connected wl '1 these disks, lead to the ears of
an officer, and the approach of a ship Is heard with unmistak-
able definitcness.
As the ship, approaches the noise becomes louder in one car or the
other. When the submarine commander hears an equally loud .
noise In each ear, he knows that the ship is straight ahead.
"Fire," he orders and the torpedo shoots toward the surface
at a carefully calculated angle, hitting tho ship well below the
water-line.
Th,e sinking of Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish ships would be
readily explained, if the Swiss reports are true. The submarine
commander, guided to his prey by sound alone would have.no
way of fixing the nationality of the ship attacked.

INSANITY WILL BE
Trial of Woman Who Poisoned
Children Promises Hard
Fought Legal Battle.
NEW YORK, April 24. Temporary
Insanity will be the defense of Mrs.
Ida Snlffen Walters Rogers, on trial
before Justice Tompklna on the charge
of murdering her two children, John
and Lorlda. She poisoned them so
they would not grow up and face the
shame of being nameless.
With face palt, set, and betraying
little emotion, Mrs. Rogers sat In
court today while tho Jury, completed
Just before noon, was being selected
Once only did she show emotion. It
was when Prosecutor Martin twisted
a polite question, her counsel asked
and emphasised the word "mistress"
as describing the defendant. She stlf
fened perceptibly, her eyes flashed
and the corner of her mouth trembled.
Whispers To Husband.
Frequently through the session rJie
turned and talked in whispers to her
husband, Lorlys .Elton Rogers, the
father Of the poisoned children, but
at the time of- their birth, married to
another wpma,n.
Attorney Martin showed by his ouea
tlons to the veniremen that the prosecu
tion wil be remorseless in its fight to
provrt the defendant sane at the time of
the poisoning, and that she should pay
the full penalty of the law.
That mother1 love, the emotions of a
woman scorned and the sympathy usu
ally borne a woman in distress will be
made to play large parts In tho trial
was opparont. The defense was pleased
when It found a venireman who, In ad

UPHELD BY COURT
Justice Robb 'Dismisses Injunc

Continuance of Schedule. '
CITIZENS LOSE APPEAL
"Flat Rate" Contract Declared
Prohibited By Public Utilities
Act.
The present rates tpr telephone serv
ice were upheld by the Court of Ap
peals today. The court sustained the
dismissal of an Injunction suit brought
by Jesse L. Helskell against the Chesa
peako and Potomac Telephone Com
pany. The opinion of the upper court, writ
ten by Associate Justlco Robb, confirms
the Judgment of the trial Justice, who
accepted the view presented by the
telephone company that "the contract
with Hclsrell was special and discrimi
natory In character, and hence express
ly prohibited by the public utilities
act"
Mr. Helskell, In bringing tho Injunc
tion proceedings, represented a num
ber of Washington business men who
had service known as "flat rate," un
limited buslncs service. He sought to
restrain the company from Invoking the
Public Utilities Commission net. which
approved a measured or mesraee rate
for business service.
The appellant signed a "flat rate" con
tract In 1903. The act of Congress cre
ating tho Public Utilities Commission
trn year; ttrercafa?r provided that
utllltes file schedules of rates. The tele
phone company In tho mcantlmo had
changed Ita schedules as tho service
expanded.
Tho new rates of the company fur
nished thu UtllltleH Commission did not
Includo the "flat tate," which then was
donomlnaled by the company as "ob
solete." This schidule whs satisfac
tory to the commission, which adopted
the view of th Coipomtlon Counsel
that the flat rate businesn service Is
iliHcrlminatory in the meaning of the
law."
Mr. Helskdl appealed to the District
Hunreino Court tn rrstr.iln the corrrwnv
frorr. refusing irt wcept Jiu flat tate
and the trial Justice agreed 'vlttr-the
company tnnt it contract tuin Hcisxeii
waa discriminatory In. .trmfJI pro
lslons were no lcnger charged gener

The Court of AprwnM holds that "as
the innln purpose of the public utilities
aot was tc prevent discrimination It is
apparent thut twr. fundimentally dif
ferent schedules of charges for ihe
samo sen U'n may not exist under It,"
and otflrnn the jiidrmnt of the lower

Frank T. Ippolito, the crossing police
man who risked his life for a child,
sttll lies semi-conscious at the Emerg
ency Hospital today.
There Is a chance that he wltl live,
but the odds arc against lt.
Policeman Ippolito knows nothing ot
the fund that Is being raised by Wash
ington business men because of his
heroism, and for tho relief of his
family.
Ho is unaware of tho scores who call
to know if there is a ray of hope tor
hlro: nor does ho knows that throughout
tho National Capital today there sounds
the praise of an officer who risked all
In the line or duty.
Knows Nothing.
In fact, Ippolito knows little except
that his head feels as though It wero
bursting and that things about him
appear blurred and of another land.
Occasionally, It seems, he recognises
his wife, Vincenza, who comes moist
eyed to the bedside and wonders If
her children are to Ue fatherless be
cause another little girl ran across
the path of a fire engine.
The contribution fund for the Ip
polito family continues to grow to
day. It Is the one substantial way
that men and women who admire
bravery may shpw their appreciation
of the heroism ofitthe crowing police
men, who, seeing a child irf the path

little one back only to be struck him

If anything la done for the wounded
policeman and his family, therefore, lt
must be by public subscription. Several
business men suggested to The Times
yesterdav that bravery such as that
exhibited by Ippolito should not go un
rewarded that his family should not
be left' dependent were Ippolito to go
to the final roll call. The Times started
the fund and a committee of business
