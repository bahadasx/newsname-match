'J here was almost unanimity of opin
ir?r. in official and diplomatic circles to
day that the German government will
make a reply of such character that the
.State Department will feej obliged to
enter a discussion before fakiry final
action.
There was added belief that the re
pl> trom Berlin will contain assur
rancea that Germany will conform to
rules of visit ant! search if enemy inor
? h.intmen *-ili submit 10 visit ana
*ear?*h without offensive use of gins.
It definitely pointed out hy offi
cials to-day that, while Germany id
jUF'iflcd In making this or any other
rountei proposal I11 replying to the nolo,
there must first rome a declaration
of abandonment of present submarine
warfare.
This Ik declared to be a condition ,
precedent to any discussion whatever.!
On this point of thr President's note i
and message the State Department |
is prepared to stand firm.
German embassy officials refused to- \
day to discuss the likelihood of such
declaration from the Berlin govern
ment. They said with the greatest em
phasis, howevor, that Germany deslrc3
peace with the United States, and that
the German government will not force
a break in relations.
EMBASSY I.V COMMUNICATION

Significance was given to these offi
cial embassy views, since the embassy
has been in constant communication
with the home government since the
American note was dispatched. The
inference drawn from the statement of
German diplomatic officials is that Ger
many will not hesitate to assure the
1'nitc'/ States of its intention to sus- j
pesnd submarine operations until either
an understanding is reached with the
United States, or it is shown that noth
ing can be accomplished in that di
rection.
Tt was pointed out by a diplomatic
official to-day that there have been no
reported cases ol' submarine attack
since the new crisis arose between the
two governments over destruction of

UKFILIN". April 23 (via Copenhagen;
to London, April 21).?The Imperial
Chancellor, Dr. von Doth ir.arnv-Holl- ?
wcg, returned to Berlin this afternoon,
which would seem to justify the as-,
sumption that tho empire's responsible
loaders at groat headquarters have tin-,
ished consideration of tho American
note and readied a decision regarding
Germany's reply. What this reply willj
be is naturally unknown to any but'
tho highest officials.
The Chancellor's return, it is under
stood, was not expected until Tuesday;;
hence a general decision appears toj
have been reached earlier than looked j
for. There is no intimation of when i
tho reply will be formulated, but there
seems to bo much significance in the
act that the Ivokal Anzeiger, which is
consistently well informed, says that
"Germany's strength and prestige have
so increased in the last twenty months
in the. eyes of the whole world that the
German government has, indeed, only
to follow the commandments of wis-i
dom."
The obvious deduction, according to
the view here, is that there is noth
ing to prevent Germany from mak
ing certain concessions if the lenders
feel that they can properly do so.
Whether they do feel that they can
go thus far Is, of course, another'
question.

Xews from Washington that there j

received with satisfaction by army of-j

by the wording of Secretary linker's

The only co-operation which will 1

for redisposition of the American troops
in Mexico. thorp was it plain intima

ernment liad determined to maintain a
military status quo beyond the bonier
until the Mexican do ftic.to govern
ment has demonstrated it" ability to

In the interim it is understood the
American troops will l>e so placed as to
safeguard the. border towns by vir
tually policing the area south of the
line where General Carranza has been
heretofore unable to check bandit
operations.
Secretary Raker announced his ap
proval of the redisposition plan, after
consulting with the President to-day
over a Joint report submitted by Major
Oenernl Kunston and Major -Gonoral
Scott, chief of staff, in conference on
the border. Tho plan was proposed by
General Fnnston and concurred in by
General Scott. The secretary announc
ed the administration's decision as
follows:
"General Funston has recomn.ended
a redisposition of the forces in Mexico
for the purpose of recuperating and
pending ' opportunities for further co
operation with the forces of the Je
facto government of Mexico. Tho
recommendation has be.cn approved and
its execution left to his discretion."
SL MJKCT OI?' WITHDRAWAL
is i;.\ni;it xkgotiatio.vs
Later iho secretary dictated the fol
lowing:
"The statement I have made indi
cates nothing whatever on the
question of whether the American
troops will be withdrawn from Mexico.
Tho whole subject of withdrawal of
the torces is under negotiations by tho
State Department."
Mr. Baker declined to say whether
General Kunston's report included his
previous suggestions that the border
base be shifted from Columbus, X. M.,
to Presidio, Texas, or some other point
to the east of Columbus in order to
shorten the line of communication. He
stated positively, however, that no ad
ditional regiments hail been ordered to
tho border, and that no such order was
in contemplation. The secretary made
it clear also tluit the question of with
drawal front Mexico was wholly in the
hands of the State Department.
It was announced to-night that Gen
eral Sco'.t had completed his mission to
the border, and lie would roturn to
Washington in a few days.
The new military plan leaves the pur
suit of Villj at a standstill, but frees
General Kunston's hands to make the
position of the forces in Mexico securo
by grouping the posts of such strength
as to prevent attacks by irresponsible
forces. It will also serve as a plain
warning to General Carranza that ho
must bend every effort towards gaining
control of tho territory in proximity
to the American border if he hopes
to have the troops recalled.
