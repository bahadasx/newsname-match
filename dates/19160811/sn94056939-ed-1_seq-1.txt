THE SHEEP INDUSTRY
OF NEW MEXICO
What Frnnk A. llubbcll,
Deim of Now Mexico's
Sheep Feeders, Accomplish
ed by Feeding for 120 Days
A BRIEF SKETCH OF MR.
HUBBELL'S SUCCESS
Mr. llubbcll started in the
sheep business in 1885, with 5,-
100 head of common sheep.
He now runs from 75,000 to
80,000 head of improved sheep;
Merinos, Rambouilettsnnd Shrop
shires. His breeding ewes pro
duced 2,000 lambs in 1010. He
sold 22,000 at 8 cents f. o. b
Magdalena, N. M., to average 70
pounds, and retains 10,000 to feed
on his immense feeding farm five
miles south of Albuquerque.
He owns 80 ranches, patented
and deeded land.
He owns, leases nnd controls
more than 300,000 acres of graz
ing lands.
His watering places control
about 140 miles of range, going
in one direction.
He has recently gone into the
cattle business as a side line to
sheep, and has upwards of 6,000
high-grade cattle on his range
Last winter he fed 3,000 lambs
insisting upon conditions easily
duplicated on any farm in the
state. He built pens outside and
fed alfalfa and corn, not making
use of silos. He is enhusinstic
about the possibilities of feeding
for the market in Now Mexico
and wished to demonstrate to the
small farmer that it was a pro
fitable way to market the feed
crops of the state. He fed for
120 days and made a profit above
allowances for feed, labor, etc.,
of 27. 2 per cent in that time.
He is noworectlngsilosof from
300 to 000 tons capacity and will
prepare to feed as many as 15,000
Iambs nnd from 300 to 500 head
of cattle the coming season.
His feeding pens are located
near the heart of his valley farm
five miles south of Albuquerque,
of 2,200 acres, and adjoins his
grant of 35,000 acres, pastures in
connection with his feeding
enterprise.
The farm is equipped with
comfortable headquarters living
house for his farm manager, deep
wells of great capacity, an ade
quate system of pipos through
the feeding pens, large burns,
storehouses, tractors, and all
kinds of modorn machinery.
In the management of his
business he is assisted by his
sons, James L. and Prank A. Jr.
tho former having charge of the
ranches and live stock nnd the
latter of the feeding fnrm and
other interests. Mr. llubbcll has
other sons almost ready to join
him in business. Of the three
other boys, John is assisting at
the ranches, Ramon is attending
the University of Pennsylvania
and Lawrenco is at the border
with the Now Mexico troops.
Mr. llubbcll is the dean of
New Mexico's feeding industry.
A few 'years ago New Mexico
was not considered seriously ns
a feeder state. But Mr. llubbcll
has demonstrated beyond a doubt
just what can he done nnd has
placed his state on the sheep
feeding map. Ho is a typical ex
ample of the man who stakes his
all on a little flock of sheep to
begin with and who, like the
majority, emerge in a few short
years as barons of the industry.
Mr. llubbcll had a distinct lik
ing for the shepherd's calling,
nnd to that he attributes much
of his success. No mnn can suc
ceed in this business unless he
likes it, nnd that is not a very
difficult thing for the average
man to do in the case f tho pas
toral, for somewhere in our make
up there is a streak that calls us
to the open and to the tasks as
sociated with it.
Mr. Hubbell has not only help
ed himself to opportunities nnd
made them count for something,
but he has placed opportunities
in the paths of others. He has
the common touch, and he makes
it felt amongst his fellows. He
may well be considered one of
the best champions of agriculture
in general and the sheep business
in particular, in tho grent south
west. American Sheep Breeder.

NEW MEXICO'S CHOICE

the United States Senate. Mr.
Hubbell has a strong following
throughout the entire state nnd
Is a strong, old-time republican,
highly respected by his consti

A selection less gratifying could
easily be made for the United
Strtes Senate than Mr. Hubbell.

COMMENT OF THE
STATE PRESS
Some Views of (lie Politind
Situation in Now Mexico ns
Expressed by the Nows
pupers HUBBELL AND BURSUM ARE
TAKING THE LEAD
As wo said last week, and de
sire to repeat, tho Hon. Frank A.
Hubbell is gaining strength in
every county of the state, and
it is because of his close identifi
cation with the great industril
interests of the state. Business
interests desire a certain and
effective representation in the
United State3 senate and through
out tho nation the sentiment
favoring effective and successful
business men is growing, us they
nre more practical than men with
out experience and many theories.
Mr. Hubbell is veceiveing tho
benefits of this growing senti
ment nnd will go into the next
Republican state convention back
ed by the business interests of
the state, not just becnuso 'he is
Frank A. Hubbell, a Republican,
but because lie is a man close to
the people of the state and their
interests nre his interests: one
nnd inseparable,, nnd his every
effort must act for the benefit of
the people. Those who nro
spending some of their time
wondering where his accumulat
ing strength is coming from
should think over the facts for
a few minutes and satisfy their
minds. - Las Cruces Citizen.
HAVE STOPPED TALKING MCD0MAD
The democrats hove stopped
talking McDonald, and it is said
to be because the friends of the
executive have convinced him
he can not bo reelected, and that
the less said about the issues
raised by his administration the
more votes the next democratic
candidate will get. This convic
tion is believed to havo come to
tho democratic boss after a num
ber of trips through tho state.
It is admitted by several thousand
democrats of the state that the
voters made a serious mistake at
e-.e Muni
the first election in selecting a
governor nnd it is believed they
have made this so plain to Mc.
Donald that he has decided to
retire from politics, for the pros
ent, at least. -Clayton Citizen
HIE WAY IT LOOKS
Rcpo-: from reliable sources
nnd covering practically the en
tire state of Now Mexico, indi
cate that Holm O. Btirsum, for
governor, Frank A. Hubbell, for
United States senate to succeed
Tilomas B. Catron, are steadily
gaining ground in their campaigns
for tho Republican nominations
for the offices they seek.
There is a growing belief that
Chas. A. Spiess, of Las Vegas,
and Charley Springer, of Raton,
do not look upon the asnirations
'of Bursum and Hubbell, and will
go to oxtrenie lengths to prevent
their nomination by the conven
tion on August 23. It was said
,in May that the RpioBs-Springor
I forces did not want Bursum nnd
Hubbell; that thoy merely pro
tend to supiort Secundiuo Ro
mero, of Las Vegas, for gov
! ernor, and were no more than
lukewarm in bolstering up sunn
tor Catron's fences. What was
: said to be true in May appears to
bo true in tho first pari of August
and more so." State Record.
