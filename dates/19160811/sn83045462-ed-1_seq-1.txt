Employers and Employes Equally 1

Problem Difficult.
(NEW YORK, August 11.?
| After deliberating the greater
part of the night, Commissioners
William A. Chambers, Martin A.
Knapp and (j. W. W. Hanger of
the United States board of medi- f'
ation and conciliation were to- *
day no nearer a solution of the "
"deadlock'' in the dispute between ?
the four railroad brotherhoods *
n
of the country and their em- r
ployers than they were yester- ?
day.
The efforts of the mediators to avert ^
a nation-wide strike were virtually at tl
a halt, due to the fact, it was reported, o
that the railroads refuse to arant anj- a
concession other than arbitration, while c
tne men persist in their stand for the h
unequivocal granting of their demands t
for an eight-hour day and time and a
half overtime. o
Both sides had stated their ?case to I
the mediators and the situation was de- d
scribed by Martin A. Knapp. one of the ?
mediators, as a "deadlock on the face of r
it." Mr. Knapp /Inclined to prophesy f,
as to whether a solution of the problem s
could be discovered. He said that the P
mediators were not in communication v
with President Wijson. and when asked o
if they would consult him later, replied
that it was impossible to say. b
ti
?^ Bequest for Delay. "
e'
A formal request for a twenty-four. I
hour delay in the negotiations was n
made by the federal board to the union ?
men today when they assembled to re- t,
ceive the mediators, and it was reported A
that the board, unless there was an un- *
expected change in the situation in that : *
time, was prepared to suggest to Presi-* a
dent Wilson that he intervene. ?<
Mr. Hanger, who asked for the delay, **
took pains to point out, however, that j*
no particular significance should he
attached to the sudden change in their ?:
plane. "
"It must* be remembered," he said, JJj
"that the question at issue involves z*
hundreds of railroads and thousands of
men and the mediators cannot arrive
at a judicious conclusion as to the A
merits in the case until they have *
thoroughly assimilated the situation."
Mr. Hanger added that the board expected
to continue its deliberations to- ?
day and might reach a decision by ?
evening as to the time of the next ..
meeting with one or the other side in *
the dispute.
Un willing to Wait Long. ?
"We do not intend," said W. S. Stone,
chief of the Brotherhood of Railroad ^
Engineers, "to wait very long on the u
mediators. The temperament of the
men is such that they would not have J
waited a minute if we had not per- e
suaded them to give the mediators c
| a chance. Personally, I do not care to J]
carry the strike vote around in my t
pocket for any extended period. It is h
like a stick of dynamite." r
Since its organization in 1913, through 0
an act of Congress, and up to Sep- "V
tember 20, 191G, the board has sat on ^
. c
forty-seven controversies between rail- w
roads and their employes. In every r
instance the board has succeeded in r
securing an ultimate adjustment of the e
differences, thirty-nine cases having i,,
been settled by mediation alone, and n
eight by arbitration. t
Alleged Plan of Hallway Men. h
One report current today was that ?
the railroad managers were ready to e
propose a different form of arbitation *
than that provided for under the Newlands
act, which the brotherhoods ob- n
Ject to. This was that instead of six
arbitrators?two appointed by each side T
and two neutral?the board consist of (
four appointed by each side and four i
or six neutral, making a total membership
of twelve or fourteen. This
would make It podftible also for each .
of the four brotherhoods to have an h
arbitrator on the board. ,

The unorganized men would like to n
see legislation that will protect their

question of the welfare of railroad
workers is under consideration. He 8

Charge of Using Unreliable Tax

No. II.
Editorial Correspondence of The Star.
BY THEODORE W. NOYES.
Representative Johnson arcane* Wa?hnsrton
of having used in the pant the
alae standard of measuring rompara- j
Ive tax burdens which he employs now, I
nd of having: claimed that it* results
rere favorable to Washington, until
he falsity of this claim was shown, and
hen of abandoning; this standard of
measuring comparative tax burdens and
esortlng to another. The charge Is not
f primary or vital importance. But
t Is apparently unfounded.
"The Washington papers and the
Vadliington lobbies at first insisted
hat the rate of taxation in the District
f Columbia was as much as that in
ny other city in the United States of
omparable size to Washington. They
ave been driven from that false posiion
by an exposure of the facts. *
The newspapers and advocates
if the half-and-half pian in the
Mstrict of Columbia formerly unlertook
to establish it as a fact
hat Washington paid a higher tax
ate than most of them. .But, failig
in that, they have abandoned that
tatement and now come and assert the.
roposition that the per capita tax in
i'ashington is greater than in the
ther cities of the United States." So
ays Representative Johnson. I have
een unable to find any evidence to susiin
this charge of a claim for Washigton
that its tax rate is or has been
xcessively high. As far back as 1898
nrinted in a pamphlet and in the
ewspapers, as president of the isoara
f"?Trade, an analysis of the census figres
of 1890, showing the comparative
ix burdens of Washington and other
merican cities, in which I said: "It is
urther showy that Washington's tax
N^HNmrnt was much higher in 1890
han that of most other municipalities
pproximating it in size and that con- \
eqifcently its apparent low rate ($1.50 i
er hundred) gives a false idea conerning
its actual tax burden. *
udging by the rat* of taxation, the
ilisen of Omaha was taxed more than
free times as heavily as the resident
^Washington, and the citizen of Chitgo
more than four times as heavily:
ut owin* to the low assessment of
lese two cities, the Omahaite paid
sss in actual cash into the treasury
ian the Washingtonian and the ChiBgoite
only a trifle more."
The same conclusions have 4)een
eached in the analysis of successive
ensus bulletins since that of 1890. For
istance, my conclusions in respect to
he Washington taxpayer, based on the
ensus bulletins for 1907, were:
"His tax assessment is excessively
igh. His tax rate in comparatively
m. His resultant per capita tax levy
mposes a reasonably heavy tax burden,
eavier than in the great majority of
American municipalities, and heavier
nder the surrounding conditions than
n the other American municipalities
pproxfmating Washington in size. His
eal estate bears the bulk of his proprty
tax burden. Owing to the peculiar
onditions of the National Capital, its
ick of industries, property and moneylaking
resources, the tax burden of ;
he Washington taxpayer is especially
ard to be borne."
The same note that was sounded in
espect to the Washington of 1890 and
f 1907 is duplicated in respect to the
Vashington of 1913 in the citizens'
rief. argument and evidence before the
ongressional Joint fiscal committee,
.herein it is declared: "Washington's
ealty tax burden is very heavy. It's tax
ate la moderate, but its assessment Is '
xcessively high. Washington's
ersonalty tax burden is comparatively
Igni. HaomiiKiun n iiiuj^i
ax burden, combining its heavy realty
ax and its light personalty tax. is
eavier than that of most American
ities, and averages up with that of
ities approximating it in size and genral
conditions. The burden
mposed by Congress upon the local
axpayers is fully as heavy as that
rhich the average self-governing
nunicipality imposes upon itself, and
n view of the capital's lack of taxable
esources and other peculiar disbilities
under which the District of
Columbia labors, its tax is harder to
ear than that of the average Amerian
community."
I cannot find that within the last
wenty-flve years at least Washington
as been guilty (1) of the blunder of
hinking that the tax rate alone is
ny measure of comparative tax
urdens, and (2) of the falsehood of
sserting that its own tax rate is exessively
high compared with those of
ther cities. Apparently it has during
his whole period appreciated inteligontly
the real measure of com arative
tax burdens, and has conistently
conceded that while its assessment
was excessively high its tax
ate was moderate.
If. Washington Hum never assumed the
tupldly false position attributed to It.
f course It has never been driven from
bat position by deteetlon and exposure,
'be assumption, however. Is sound tbat
r Washington had become convinced
bat Its tax contentions were rooted In
alsehood It would pcopiptly abandon
hem. eoufesnlng Its unintentional error.

NEW YORK, August 11.?The epidemic
of Infantile paralysis showed another
slight decline today and health experts
who are fighting the scourge here were
more hopeful that the cool weather which
relieved the city yesterday would materially
check the spread of the plague.
The dally bulletin of the health department
shows that during the twenty-fourhodr
period which ended at 10 a.m., thirty-one
children died of the disease a*nd
165 new cases were reported in the five
boroughs of New York city. These figures
compare hopefully with yesterday's when
thirty-eight children were killed by the
plague and 175 stricken.
Serious in Philadelphia.
PHILADELPHIA. August 11.?With
sixteen new cases of infantile paralysis
and four deaths reported in this city for
the twenty-four hours ending this morning
at 9 o'clock, and a total of fifty-eight
cases in the city since Monday morning
alone, the disease is beginning to assume
serious proportions in the eyes of
the medical authorities and renewed efforts
are being made to check its growth
and stamp it out. Since the 1st of July
there have been 148 cases, with twentyeight
deaths.
Every employe of the department of
health and charities whose work is in
any way connected with the health service
in the city, has been recalled from
hio vji? ?Hnn and nut to work. Meetings
of physicians have been called and the
co-operation of the whole city is asked
in the light.
Pennsylvania Quarantine Extended.
HA^tRISBURG. Pa., August 11.?Pennsylvania's
quarantine for infantile paralysis
was today extended to all borders of
the state. Medical officers and inspectors
began du^y at points where railroads
cross the state from all parts of New
York, Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland.
If Conditions demand the quarantine
will oe made more stringent and
highways will be patrolled.
^Reports were' 4ceived at the department
of health today that a band of thirty
gypsies from Rochester, half of them under
sixteen years of age, had been turned
back at the New York state line, having
endeavored to enter the state in Erie
county. Another band which tried to
enter the state near Belvedere were
turned back into New Jersey. The latter
band traveled in automobiles with
Massachusetts licenses.

CHICAGO, August 11.?Chicago physicians
who fail promptly to report cases
of Infantile paralysis are likely to Hnd
themselves defendants in aamage suits
as a part of the plan of Dr. John Dill
Robertson, health commissioner, to keep
the disease under control. The commissioner
announced today that he would
take prompt steps against one phystCfan,
who. he claims, failed to r?f>ort a case
which has been developing since August
1. Four new cases of the disease were

Dr. William C. Woodward, health officer,
and Dr. J. J. Kinyoun, bacteriologist
or the health department, are in
New York today, studying the methods
employed there against the spread of
the disease.
They expect to return to Washington i

PARIS, August 11,1:50 p.m.?
An attack b\r Anglo-French
forces on the Bulgarians at
Doiran. forty miles northwest of
Saloniki, is reported in a Havas
dispatch from Saloniki. Thg allies
occupied the Doiran railway
station and a neighboring hill.
In front of the captured positions,
the dispatch says, the
bodies of numerous Bulgarians
were found. The attack was preceded
by a vigorous bombardment.
At other points along the
front artillery fighting continues,
with patrol engagements along
the Serbian border. '

station lies five miles east of
the town.
There have been several small
engagements recently along this
front, as well as frequent heavy
artillery battles. A general offensive
movement on the part of
the army of French. British and
Serbians has been expected some
time.
NO D. C. COMMITTEE QUORUM.
Body Was Expected to Act on Henry
S. Baker's Nomination.
The Senate District committee failed
to get a quorum at a meeting called
today by Chairman John Walter Smith.
It had been expected that the nomination
of Henry S. Baker to succeed himself as
excise commissioner of the District
would be up for consideration. Mr.
Baker's confirmation is strongly opposed
by the senators who brought about the
rejection of the nomination of Gen. Robert
G. Smith as a member of the excise
board.
The fact that Mr. Baker is an uncle of
the Dresent Secretary of War outs c
democratic senators in an awkward posi- b
tlon regarding the nomination, it was }
said today. A considerable number of
the democrats opposed the confirmation v
of Gen. Smith and are expected to op- p
pose that of Mr. Baker. ^

PRESIDENT DECIDES
TO SPEAKIN WEST
Will Swing Across Continent
on Speech-Making Tour
During Campaign.
FIRST CHANCE TO VISIT
THE PACIFIC COAST
nr:ii
fiuuamy win xuuuw iuc Mvnuviu
Route and Come Home Along
Mexican Border.
President Wilson, it was learned
today, will swing across the
continent and back on a speaking
tour before the presidential
campaign closes. No date has
been set for the trip, but it will
probably be in September, some
time after his notification and acceptance
at Shadow Lawn, now
planned to take place the last of
August or the first part of September.
The President Is expected to go across
the west by the northern route, somewhat
over the same section Presidential Candate
Hughes is following, and return by
the southern, route, probably stopping
along the Mexican border to review the
troops there
The review of the regulars and volunteers
on the border w'si be one of the
most interesting features of the trip.
Many requests have reached the President
to visit the troops and personally inspect
their equipment, general condition
and readiness for actual war service if
called upon to go into conflict.
s
Settles Question of Speeches.
The President's purpose to go west
definitely determines the question as to
his making speeches during the campaign.
Two ideas were advanced by his advisers
as to his making campaign speeches. One
was that he should remain at Shadow
Lawn, receive delegations of democrats
and do his speaking there, as McKinley
did in the campaign of 1896, from hiB
home at Canton; The other was that
he should throw objections aside and go
straight among the people with his appeal
for re-election.
A? nnw inriiratsd the President will
have little or no vacation this yeag. He
is to remain here until Congress adjourns
and then go to Shadow Lawn.
His time there will be taken up in conferences
with democratic visitors and
with masses of correspondence pouring
In on him.
The proposed trip across the continent
would take about twenty days,
and upon his return the President
would be expected to make a few
speeches at eastern points.
Trip to Fulfill Promise. ,
The western trip Is to fill promises
long made to westerners to go among
them. The President has visited nearly
all portions of the country but the far
west and Pacific coast since he has been
in the White House.
He accepted invitations to visit the
Panama-Pacific expedition and his
itinerary had been made up. The serious
questions arising out of the European
war kept him here. Every time
he has planned to go to the far west
something lias turned up to prevent.
Among the western people the President
would personally come in contact
with the bulk of the woman voters of
the country, presumably arrayed against
him because of his attitude in favor of
state settlement of the question.
The democratic national committee has
announced that the party will do all it
?an to obtain- female votes, and- politicians
consider that about the best way
to get the support of the women of the
Car west will be* to go among them and
talk to them.

Mayor Dahlman of Omaha and Representative
Lobeek of Nebraska urged the
President today to visit Omaha, preferibly
late in September or early in Octo>e?,
during the celebration of the fif;ie:h
anniversary of the admission of
Mebraska to statehood. ,

AUSTRIANS STRIVE
TO REFORM FRONT
AS ITALIANS GAIN
Continue Retreat in Direction
of Dornberg and
Schon Pass.
ATTEMPT OFFENSIVE
IN MONTE NERO REGION
Every Foot of Ground Around
Gorizia Sees Bitter
Fighting.
/
ALL IT ALT IS REJOICING
Flood of Congratulations Come From
All Parts of World, King Being
Pleased by Those
From U. S.
ROME, August 11.?The importance,
of the Italian successes
around Gorizia is ' becoming
more evident hourly. The battle
is continuing behind the city over
a front about twelve'miles long.
The Austrians have retreated
along the railroad in the direction
oi uornDerg, eight miles southeast
of Gorizia, and over the national
highway to Schon pass, six
miles to the east, and are now attempting
to reform their front on
a line extending from Vipacco to
Tarnova.
Meanwhile the Austrians are attempting
to take the offensive at
Monte Nero and various other
points of the Italian front, but
thus far have been unable to
divert the Italians from their
operations behind Gorizia.
The number of prisoners taken
by the Italians since the fall oi
Gorizia now erfCeeds 15,000, according
to the corrfspondent of
the Tribuna on the Isonzo
front. Italian cavalry and cyclists
are clearing the valleys of the retreating
Austrians and, according
to the correspondent, the battle
continues in favor of the
Italians on both wings.
Fighting Has Been Severe.
The belief prevails tfcat the victory of
the Italions was not due to the demoralN
zation of the Austrians, as the fighting
was the severest seen on this front. The
Austrians contested every foot of the
ground about Gorisia even after the loss
of tl^e strategic points of Monte Sabotino
and Monte San Michele.
While the success of the Italians undoubtedly
was due largely to the new
heavy artillery which matched at last,
after a year of wgiting for their manufacture,
the hea^y 305-millimeters Austrian
gun. yet the hand-to-hand fighting
was appalling tin fierceness, bayonets,
knives, bomba, cavalry, swords, pistols
and arms of every description being used.
Personal deeds of heroism were plentiful.
especially in connection with the
Italian use of a new method for destroying
barbed wire entanglements, involving
the almost certain death of the soldier
who plants .the bomb for this purifbse.
Austrians Prepared.
The victory of the Italians is considered
all the t more creditable since
the Austrians on the lower Isonzo frodt
had long prepared for an attack on a
large scale, having successfully resist
ed many previous ones on small sectors.
The .taking of Alonte Sabot inc. the keja
to Gorizia. and/* the vast section surrounding
it. is regarded as the biggest
feat in all the fighting in the lower
Isonzo region. While the Italians previously
took and lost Michele many
times they never before were able to
approach Sabotino.
Counter Attacks Hourly.
The Auotrians fought for the possession
of San Michele to the very las!,
counter attacking hourly. The defense,
and capture of the bridge over the
Isonzo connecting Podgora and Gorizia
was the outstanding feature "bf the latrt
twenty-four hours of fighting: before
the king led the first cavalry and
cyclists into the city. The Austrian?
were unable to hold the bridge against
the Italian artillery and blew up one
half to prevent the Italians crossing.
The cavalry and cyclists swam the
river at night under a blaze of searchlights
from the Austrian positions and
under fire from machine guns, that
played on the swimmers like garden
hose.
Enthusiasm at High Pitch.
Popular enthusiasm is at high pitch
:hroughout Italy. Congratulations are
pouring in from all parts of the world
:o King Victor Emmanuel and Gen.
2adorna. The king and Vommander-inihief
have been particularly pleased by
nessages from Italians in New York
tnd other parts of the United States.
The third army, under command of the
Duke of Aosta, which is still bearing
he brunt of the fighting, has won high
>raise as well as much sympathy on
iccount of its losses. The duke before
he battle began called on his army to
Ight and "win in the name of your
nothers. your wives, your sisters and
rour country."
