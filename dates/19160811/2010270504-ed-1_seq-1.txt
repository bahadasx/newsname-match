Tha Silver Fox.
The silver fox Is really a black fox,
Instead, as some persons suppose, of be.
ing nlnipst whito or a silver gray. Th
name Is given on account of tho pres
ence of glistening white imd grayish
hairs, which appear among tho black.
In tho better grades the loug, silky
brush has a tip of pure white. About
u quarter of a century ago tho little
animal, which weighs when full-grown
only about twelve pounds, became al
most extinct Because of tho beauty
of Its fur the species was trapped un
til almost the lust of them had disap
peared. For u long tlmo tho standard
price offered by tho Hudson Bay com
pany for silver fox pelU was around
$1,000, aud the efforts of tho French
Cauadinns, half breeds and Indian
trnppers to obtain Mils sum, to thorn a
fortune, can bo In tcr Imagined than
described. St Lout Post-Dispatch.
