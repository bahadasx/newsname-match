COTTONWOOD, IDAHO, FRIDAY, AUGUST 11, 1916.
$1.50 A YEAR.
WILL HOLD A
BIG FALL FAIR
Plans Now Uuder Way for a
Big Agricultural Fair and
Livestock Show in October
—Committees Are Named.
Cottonwood is to have an an
nual agriculture fair and live
stock show.
This matter was decided in the
affirmative some time ago and
Wednesday afternoon at a meet
ing of the governing board of the
commercial club plans were out
lined and committees appointed
to have charge of the arrange
ments. The fair this year will
cover three days, Otober4, 5 and
6, and if the present plans are
successfully carried out it will
prove to be one of the largest
projects ever attempted in a
town of this size in the Inland
Empire.
According to present plans
buildings are to be provided for
the agricultural and horticultural
displays, which will be in charge
of some of the most capable far
mers of this section, whi'e
another building will be turned
over to the ladies to be fil.ed with
exhibits in the fine arts and do
mestic science lines.
A strong feature of the fair,
and one that will appeal particu
larly to the farmers of this sec
tion, will be the live stock de
partments. These are divided in
to four divisions, one each being
given over to beef cattle, dairy
cattle, horses and swine. Men
particularly adapted to these di
visions will be in charge of the
same and some exceptionally fine
exhibits are looked for in the
livestock department. Sheds will
be provided for the livestock and
it is possible certain streets will be
closed for these exhibits, while
the town generally will be turned
over to the fair committees to
arrange matters as they see fit.
Carnival attractions and
amusement features of various
kinds will be provided and the
aim is to have "something doing"
every minute during the entire
three days. Small sports will be
pulled off in the streets for the
benefit of the young folks, while
lectures from prominent men
from the state university will be
held daily on agricultural and
livestock topics.
On the evening of October 6th
a closing feature of the big fair
will be a lecture by Nels Darling,
the noted lecturer, who will open
the fall and winter Redpath ly
ceum course on that date in our
city. This will be a special at
traciion for the fair and should
prove of much interest to the
fair visitors.
While the various committees
have not yet had an opportunity
of arranging the details of their
work and the premium list has
not been prepared it is hoped to
have these matters in shape soon
for publication and in the mean
time it will be well for those de
siring to place exhibits at the
fair to begin collecting their
grain, fruit and vegtable samples
and get their livestock in shape
to draw down premiums.
The following committees were
named yesterday to have charge
of the various departments of
the fair and it may be well for
them to get together at an early
date to arrange the details of
their work:

Had Bad Auto Accident
Quite a serious accident oc
curred near the Joseph Herzog
farm east of Ferdinand Sunday
afternoon when a car driven by
Dixon Brown ran off the grade*
and turned over, seriously injur
ing the occupants of the car. Mr.
and Mrs. Brown and daughter
and Bert and Andy Oliver had
started for Lewiston and, on
reaching the grade north of the
Herzog home, the car started to
slip off one side of the grade.
Mr. Brown, who was driving,
started to turn the car back onto
the grade and in some manner
the throttle was thrown open and
the car shot across the road and
off the grade on the other side,
catching the passengers beneath
it and injuring them severely.
Aid was soon at hand and a mes
sage was sent to this place for
Dr. Shinnick who was on the
scene by the time the car was
righted and the injured picked
up. After returning-to the Brown
home the doctor began dressing
the wounds and found that Bert
Oliver had sustained a complete
fracture of the left leg below the
knee; Andy Oliver had a disloca
tion of the shoulder and an injury
to the spine that may prove se
rious; Mr. Brown had three ribs
broken and his back injured;
Mrs. Brown had a broken nose
and a bad cut from the base of
the nose across the cheek, and
their daughter had a small wound
in the back. Besides the injuries
mentioned all were badly bruised
and shaken up and their escape
from death was little short of
miraculous.
The grade where the accident
occurred is rather narrow but not
at all steep and the fill is not
more than eight or ten feet high.
It is thought the accident result
ed from the brakes not holding
properly and inexperience on the
part of the driver, who has only
driven his car for a few weeks.
The patients are said to be rest
ing easy at this time and will
soon be themselves again. They
lire fortunate in escaping from
the accident as luckily as they
did.
Will Handle Trucks
L. L. Schwartz, factory repre
sentative, and L. H. Briggs, gen
eral agent at Lewiston, Idaho,
for the Truck Attachment Com
pany of Seattle, spent yesterday
in town with C. W. Thompson of
the Cottonwood Garage, who has
taken the Idaho county agency
for the Wright Truck Attach
ment for Ford or other small
cars.
SThis attachment which con
verts the touring car or roadster
into a ton truck with 1000 lbs.
overload, differs materially from
other similar devices in that it
provides four speeds ahead and
two reverse for Ford cars, doing
away with much of the low gear
work and eliminating the over
heating.
One of these trucks will be
seen on the streets of Cottonwood
1 next week.

CANDIDATES
GOT BUSY
Last Day Saw Many File For
Positions on Both Tickets—
Be Some Hot Contests at
Primary Election.
The politicians got right busy
over at Grangeville Saturday and
before the curtain rang down on
the day's work at the auditor's
office all of the places on both
county tickets were filled and
some left over for good measure.
In fact, several offices will be
strongly contested for on both
tickets at the primary election
and the race between the différ
ant candidates promises consider
able amusement for the casual
onlooker.
The office of probate judge
proves to be the attractive plum
on the republican ticket and four
men are grooming themselves to
see how far they can leave the
other fellows behind at the pri
mary. On the democratic ticket
the boys seem to want the job of
sticking the tax onto the other
fellow and three are out for the
office of assessor, while the re
publicans have only two who as
pire for this office. Down in the
third district every other fellow
wants to be county commissioner
and the republicans have three
aspirants for the job to two for
the democrats. Just what the
final result will be no one can tell
but the sifting will be done on
September 5th and after that
date it will be up to the candi
dates nominated to get in and
collar more votes than the other
fellow can round up by the gen
eral election in November or go
back to the old job.
Following is a list of the nom
inations on both tickets:
Senate—E. S. Sweet, r; N. B.
Pettibone, d.

Finish Orofino Street Paving
Orofino, August 5.—The paving
of the streets in Orofino will be
practically completed today
There will be some clean-up work
to do next week, but by the mid
die of the week all the work
should be finished by the con
tractors. This work is the most
forward step made by the town
since its incorporation; and those
who at first opposed the paving
of the streets are now loudest in
praise of the work.
Remedy for Clover Bloat.
T. J. Preston, the well known
secretary of the Nezperce Live
Stock Association and a rancher
and stockman of much practical
experience, has a simple remedy
for clover and alfalfa bloat which
he says has never failed for him.
It is merely to pour cold water
on the affected animal's back
over the kidneys until it is re
lieved which is generally very
quickly.
Mr. Preston had read in The
Herald last week of the death of
N. H. Jacobs' fine registered bull
from alfalfa bloat, and this sug
gested giving publicity to the
remedy that he has so well prov
en to his own satisfaction, that
he has no fear of animal bloat,
and keep much of his stock in the
alfalfa field through the season.
He stated that the remedy was
accidentally discovered some time
ago in south Idaho while parties
were working with a bloated cow.
While others went for remedies,
etc., she was left in charge of a
man on a water wagon. He had
occasion to drive her to the oppo
site side of the wagon and resort
ed to a bucket of water to urge
her along. The water was dashed
on her back; she belched and was
relieved at once. This man, in
his next experience with bloated
stock, remembered what that
bucket of water had done and
tried it again, with the desired
result, and he has continued to
use the remedy effectively ever
since. Mr. Preston was told of
this by a party who had wit
nessed it, and though skeptical
when he first tried it, Preèton
has found it infallible in many
tests and heartily recommends
the treatment to his brother
tttockmen.—Herald.
Auto Club Meet Tuesday
The second meeting of the Ida
ho County Automobile Associa
tion will be held at Grangeville
on Tuesday evening of next week
at 7 o'clock, at which time many
matters of importance to the club
and its membership will be taken
up for consideration and disposal.
It is desired tnat all west side
members who intend attending
the meeting gather at this place
at 5 p. m. on the above date and
drive in a body to the county
seat. If you intend going kindly
leave your name with the presi
dent, F. A. Kelsey.
New Creamery A Big Success
The local creamery turned out
two thousand pounds of butter
last week—the third week of its
existence—and churned an even
one thousand pounds on Monday
of this week, which will make
the present week's output reach
well above the record of last
week. The creamery produced
4450 pounds of butter during the
first fifteen days of its operation,
which is a mighty nice record for
an infant industry that was con
demned to failure before it was
started. Besides supplying the
local trade and that of nearby
towns, the creamery now has a
standing order of 600 pounds of
butter per week from the new
creamery at Coeurd'Alene and is
rapidly invading other territory.
The creamery under the manage
ment of Herbert Kleeman is turn
ing out a first class article in the
butter line and will have no
trouble in disposing of its entire
output as soon as the brand be
comes known to the public.
Besides manufacturing quite a
quantity of ice cream for the
prairie trade, the creamery is
also receiving a nice income from
the sale of buttermilk to local
hog men who find this by-pro
duct a fine feed for growing pigs.

which speaks highly for the
Troy product.
H. N. Johnson was arrested at
Lewiston the first of the week on
a charge of selling intoxicants to
Indians and was later bound over
to the Federal court uuder $250
bonds. It is said Johnson fur

show the contents to carry as
much as 93 per cent of alcohol.
A suit for $6,000 damages was
filed at Grangeville late last week
by John H. Forsmann against
Steve Trautman. The complaint
alleges that the plaintiff was as
saulted by the defendant in Cot
tonwood in September, 1915, and
sustained two broken ribs, some
teeth knocked out and other in
juries that have made an opera
tion necessary.
Elmer Lentz, of the Vollmer
section, was quite badly kicked
by a horse last week. While
working in the barn one of the
horses kicked him in the head,
rendering him unconscious. The
horse kicked him in the face sev
eral times as he lay senseless and
damaged his features badly. He
was found later by children and
pulled out of danger until he re
vived.
Perhaps a second Senator Gore

98 cents to $1.01. Barley has
kept pace with wheat during the
past few days and yesterday $1.30

Demonstrate Thresher Fire
Extinguisher.
A. E. Wade, county agricultur
ist of Lewis county, announces
that a demonstration of a thresh

will be held at Vollmer on Tues
day, August 15th, at 2 p. m„ un
der the auspices of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture and
the Extention Department of the
University of Idaho. All thresh

demonstration, which will be of
particular interest to them in pre
venting the loss of their ma
chines by explosions and fire.
Grain Prices Are Booming
Grain prices have been going
skyward with leaps and bounds
during the past week and the
quotations are now higher than
they have been for several years.
A big shortage in the wheat and
corn crops throughout the coun
try and the poor quality of the
grain being harvested in some
sections are responsible for the
high prices and it is hard to say
just where the market will stop.
Local buyers are now offering to
contract for good wheat at a dol
lar a bushel and $1.30 per hund
red is being offered for good bar
ley on contracts, while an open
price of $1.12 is quoted for oats.
Some of the last year's crop is
being sold at these prices and a
few farmers have contracted
part of the new crop still in the
field, but most of them are hold
ing their grain in hopes that the
market will go considerably
higher within the next few
weeks.
Miss Bertha Ries is spending a
few days in the city from Ferdi
nand.
W. L. Williams, district agent
for the Overland auto, spent sev
eral days in the city this week
from Lewiston and received an
order before leaving from C. W.
Thompson, the local dealer, for
twenty of the new 1917 model
cars as soon as the same can be
delivered. Mr. Williams was
driving one of the new cars
which is very attractive looking.
The new car has as special fea
tures cantilever springs, gas tank
in rear and extra long wheel
base. It is a 5-passenger, 4
cylinder car of 35 horse power
and is priced at $910, delivered.
We predict many sales of the new
car m this territory.
