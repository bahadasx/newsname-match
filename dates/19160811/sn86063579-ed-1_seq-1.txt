Tor Cm eeo.4 tinw in one week
tt JL-ommu) National Quad has re-
ee!.'4 o. to entrain and to re
port tt te-2, N. U. CoL Henry
Ktror. camp eoamander, received
the w-r at no.a ' yeaterdy. The
oredr came from the aoatbern depart
meat of the army.
The telegram ordered the two reg
imenta to move an aoon poaaible.
OOers aay that the morecent will
be started Thuraday. ' Creaking
earn will start Tuesday and contin
ue Wednesday. The First Regiment
troops will move Thursday morning
over the Rook Inland. The Second
Regiment trill move in the afternoon
over the Missouri Pacific lines. On
an average schedule of tweuty miles
an hour, of fleers hope to arrive in
Demrng in 00 bourn. The distance
is 1,060 miles.
The troops will travel in two sec
tions over each road. Enlisted men
will travel in tourist sleepers. Offic
er will travel in standard sleepers.
Each car will carry a stove for cook
ing. Five days rations will be issued
to each man before leavm, and 10
days' extra rations will be carried.
Each regiment will carry lis own
e,-'"tnent. Heavy supplies, such as
-.-. z jnesH, and eitra equip?
hunt, will be carried with the troop
. Fifteen freight cars will be required
to carry this equipment. One carload
of horses for menAers of the staff
' will be carried. The railroads were
yesterday given uotiee to bring in
their equipment in the required 72
hours time. '
Troops from Delaware have been
stationed at Deming. Colorado, West
Virginia and Wyoming troops have
alNO been ordered there. -
The present camp is in excellent
condition, according to Capt. B. F.
Jungkind, Medical Cors. No men
are in the hospital. All vaccinations
, and injections of anti-typhoid ser
um have been completed. The high
altitude of Deming, and the pure wat
er and cool nights will better their
condition, Catain Jungkiiid says.
"The main objection of men eligible
to join the guard and who luive not
done so, is now overcome, Captain
Jungkind said. "They have argued
mil iur i.nij ramm mri uita is.., jviiu
was because they did not want to
k . U. I V.... AlA M ... ....M
stay in camp all summer. We want
. now to recruit the guard to its full
strength, and think the order . re
ceived today will be a great stimu
lus. Dealing's climate is of the best
and the duties there will be to tome
extent a vacation. Cool nights i.
Arkansans is a vacation itself."
For the first time since mohilixntioh
the men received their pay yesterday.
Forty-eight thonssnd dollars was
paid out by Mnj. K. R. Jett, Unit!
States disbursing agent at the camp.
All day long compnies lined up fee
' fore the camp quartermaster's of
fice, awaiting their turn to be pais.
As resnlt old eeonnts were settled
and the post exchange d'd a record
business. An extra force of men
cared for the added patronage.
To prevent any disturbances
which might result from pay day,and
also to return men without passes
officers at camp deailed a heavy pro
vost gnard. to cover Little Rook
and Arjenta streets lost night. The
presence of soldiers on the streets
armed with rifles and side arms, oc
casioned no little comment. The
guard was not kept very bnsy. a
there' were no disturbances. Little

o know if the editor would do a
little "cussing" for him. .Being in
formed that that was not a part of
the editors indoor sports, be pro
ceeded to suggest that enough at
tention was not given tat keeping
the Luna county roads in repair.
The construction work, he main
tains, was not nearly as imprtant as
it is to keep repairs up whenever it
becomes necessary. John said it
was not his custom ' to find fault.
but he felt ,that attention might be
properly directed along this line.

Dcmiug was saddened Monday
morning by the telegraphic an
nnuneement that Mrs. Mattie E. Wat-
kiiiH, who but a day or two previous
left here for Long Beach, Cel., had
passed suddenly away of heart fail
lire. The news was later confirmed
that she Jiud gone out for an curly
morning plunge in 'the snrf with ber
daughter, Mrs. Ray Walker, and had
advanced only a few feet in the wat
er, following her daughter, when s
was stricken with heart failure, and
though help was summoned immedi
ately ii nd she was taken to a nearby
hotel, and medical aid was immedi
ately summoned, there was no earthly
power that could restore ber to con
sciousness.
The remains were brought to Dem
ing by Mrs. Walker, Miss Edna Wat-
kin, and brother, Latimer, arriving
Wednesday afternoon. They were
eouveyed by loving hands to the old
home, immediately south of the city,
where the funeral was conducted
yesterday morning at ten o'clock,
Rev. W. K. Foulks, assisted bv Rev.
Theodore I'lutt, officiating as clergy
men.
It is safe to say that a more beaut
iful life was never paid a more beaut
iful tribute tbnn was the life of the
Jcceased on this occasion. The flor
al offerings occupied two sides of the
large front parlor and completely en
veloped the casket. From the. tiny
bouquet to the large floral piece, all
paying their tribute of love.
Appropriate music was furnished
by the Baptist choir, the closing
selection "Mother Mnehree" being
rendered by Rev. Theodore Piatt.
The five stalwart sons, Reed, Clem,
Sinn, George, and I ji timer, and one
son-in-lnw, acting as pall-hearers,
paying the Inst tribute of respect to
their deNtrted mother. The eldest
daughter, Mrs. Maud Campbell, of
Quitaque, Texas, was unable to make
connections to attend the funeral.
The dirc-ased, whose maiden nume
was Miss Mattio Gray, was born
at Fayettcsville, Ark., Ang. 27, 18."8,
and was married to Mr. J. A. Wat
kns in Fanning county, Texas, Dec.
4, 1877, coming to New Mexico about
two decade ago. - There were six
boys and five girls born to this union,

II. H. Jacobs recently returned
from a trip through the irrigated
states of the west, making careful
observation of conditions and is firm
in his belief that the Miinbres Valley
is the best of all, taking all things
into .consideration. r
Telieving this' he has purchased a
half interest of Fred Sherman in
the east farm paying $6000 for it
He has just installed an electric
pumping plant, with a Layne Bo
ler pump, delivering 1000 gallons per
minute. He has also installed a
Layne & Bowler pump on the west
farm. The new well is 127 feet deep,
with 28 feet of fine water-bearing
gravel
Mr. Jacobs has 66 acres of fine al
falfa and (12 acres of feed crops,
com, just coming into roasting cars.
Mr. Jacobs would be glad to hav
any of Demiug's honored guests visit
his fine farms and pumping plants
