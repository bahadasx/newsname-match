ALFALFA WEEVIL IS NOW
SPREADING FAST IN
THE WEST
Washington, D. C., Aug. 8—The al
falfa weevil is spreading away which
n aKes it possible that sooner or later
every section of the country wiM have
to consider the problem ol guarding
against this pest. During the twelve
years since the weevil was introduced
into America it has been confined to
the Great Basin of the West, but it
has been lound this year by the bu
reau of Entomology at Malta, Mc
Cammon, Pocatello and Blackfoot,
Idaho, all well within the Snake river
drainage system, and at Duchesne,
Utah, in the Colorado River system,
which like that of the Snake slopes
to the Pacific. Within the Great Ba
sin the weevil has sprad so far south
as Richfield into the alfalfa fields of
central Utah. The insect, in spreading
across the continental divide, Depart
ment entomologists say, is to be re
garded merely as passing a convenient
landmark rather than as surmounting
a barrier, for experience has not
shown that it spreads faster along
rivers than across mountain ranges.
Nevertheless, it is now many miles
nearer to important alfalfa-growing
districts which have hitherto felt safe
from its attack.
Description of Weevil
A description of the alfalfa weevil
and methods of combating its ravages
are contained in a new publication of
the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
Farmer's Bulletin 741. The spread
of the pest has, as a matter ot fact
been slower than was at one time
feared; its progress has been steady.
In Utah and in small portions of Ida
ho and Wyoming, where it now exists,
it has caused at times a loss of 50
per cent of the first cutting of alfalfa
and a total loss of the second cutting.
In order that farmers in those sec.
tions in which the weevil has not yet
appeared may be able to recognize the
pest and to protect their crops from
it, the bulletin already mentioned con
tains details of its habits and of its
appearance in the various life stages.
The weevil is most easily discovered
in the form of the full grown larva.
It is then a green Worm-like crea
ture one-fourth of an inch long with a
black head and a faint white stripe
down the middle of the back. It feeds
upon the leaves of alfalfa mainly dur
ing late May, June and early July and
may be found by sweeping the tops
of the plants with an insect net or by
looking for the notches in the leaves
where it has fed. When the larvae
are numerous they destroy most of the
tender growth and cause the tops to
appear white, making the field look as
if frostbitten when,yiewed from a dis
tance.
The adult insect is an oval, brown
beetle three-sixteenths of an inch long
with prominent snout. Its color fre
quently is nearly black. This beetle
is harder to discover than the larva,
but. on the other hand, it is present
in the field the whole year around.
In winter it can be found by digging
about the crowns and roots of al
falfa plants.
The alfalfa weevil does not hiber
nate definitely. When the weather is
cool the adults are quiet, but with
warmer temperatures they quickly' re
sume their activities. Egg laying be
gins in early spring and is usually end
ed by June 10. One efficacious method
of controlling the pest, therefore, is
to destroy the eggs by pasturing the
first crop up to that time.
A similar result may be obtained by
cutting the alfalfa green ..nd feeding it
as a soiling crop.
If this is not done the larvae hatch
in large numbers about the last week
of May or earlier and eat the alfalfa
leaves so rapidly that the plant Is un
able to outgrow the injury. After the
field is cut the larvae which have been
feeding upon the first crop gather
upon thhe buds of the stubble and fre
nuently consume all the second crop.
Bv that time most of the insects have
completed their growing period and
have gone into the pupal or resting
stage. The later growth of the crop,
therefore, does not suffer from them.
To protect the crop pasturing, as has
been said, is effective in the earlv part
of the season. The held should be
divided into two or three lots and each
lot should be pastured alternately, the
animals being left in it until the al
falfa has been eaten down close to
the ground. The number and size of
the lots should be proportioned to the
producing power of the field and the
number of animals to be pastured so
that each lot may be grazed al" 1 * 1 '
once in two weeks. Pasturing should
be practiced until most of the weevil
eggs have been laid, which, in prac
tice. means a little later than the
usual cutting time of the first cr °P
This'" method has the additional ad
vantage of providinc an economical
method of fattening live stock Com
bined with the proper feed of gram,
alfalfa pasture is excellent for putting
on weight and it is said that many
farms would probably be more profit
able if their management centered
about the pasturing of stock on alfalfa
with the growing of enough other
crops to provide grain and forage
throughout the year.
Tf the weevils are not killed earlv
?n the year they may be destroyed af
ter the first crop has been removed
by getting rid of all the vegetation in
field, crushing the clods, and tilling
the cracks so as to expose the entire
surface to the sun. This is best done
by covering the field with a dust
much, the dust being an additional
means of killing weevils; Success
obviously depends upon doing the
work when .the ground is dry and the
weather warm and bright.
The second crop may also be pro
tected by spraying the stubble. Spray
ing may also be resorted to in the
spring. From SO to 100 gallons per
acre of a mixture of arsenite of zinc
and water in the proportion of four
pounds of powder in 100 gallons are
used for this purpose. The appara
tus best suited for alfalfa spraying is
described in detail in the .bulletin
already mentioned. Still another rec
ommendation made in this bulletin is
the stimulation of the growth of the
alfalfa by cultivating the field in the
spring. This does not destroy the
weevils but it serves to produce a
larger and earlier yield when their at
tacks make early cutting necessary.
Up to the present, however, more
farmers are concerned with prevent
ing the alfalfa weevil reaching their
fields than they are with controlling
it in them. No one knows exactly
how the weevils spread. It is known,
for example, that the insects are often
found in green alfalfa fresh from the
field and in second-crop hay and
among potatoes which have been in
contact with it. They are found also
in cured alfalfa hay, especially that of
the second cutting. Potatoes aften are
hauled in cars upon a bedding of
green alfalfa hay and there is danger
that the weevil may be transported in
this way. On the other hand, how
ever, there is no evidence to show
that the weevil spreads more rapidly
along railroads than elsewhere.

HOLT NAMED FDR POSI
TION ON REPI1BL
STATE TICKET
The nomination papers of B. M.
Holt were filed with the secretary of
state Friday for the Republican nomi
ation fo r lieu'er ant governor. The
papers were filed by Mr. M. H. Gib
bons, and as a result of the demand
of many Republican voters of Canyon
county. The step was taken without
the knowledge of Mr. Holt, who at the
time was at the Payette lakes with
his family.
Upon his return home Mr. Holt
was presented with petitions signed
by the leading Republicans of the
county asking him to become a can
didate and file his acceptance of the
nomination.
Prominent Man
Mr. B.M . Holt of Caldwell is one
of the most prominent and well known
business men of the state. He is the
head of the Caldwell Milling & Ele
vator Co. and associate companies; of
Pacific Seed company, and associate
companies. He is also Interested in
other business enterprises in Caldwell
and other parts of the state.
Mr. Holt is known as one of the
really big men engaged in business in
this state. He is well known and
highly respected throughout southern
Idaho. Mr. Holt is big enough in
every respect to fill with credit to the
täte any position in the state. He is
unquestionably the biggest man who
has ever been nominated for lieuten
ant governor of this state. »
T^o From Canyon County
There are only two candidates for
he Republican nomination for lieu
enant governor. They are Mr. B. M.
Holt of Caldwell and Mr. L. V. Patch
of Payette. One safe guess is that Can
yon county will furnish the next lieu
tenant governor of Idaho.
Both men are well qualified for the
position but of the two Mr. Holt
will undoubtedly be the stronger can
didate.

EFFERVESCENT FRANCISCO
(From the Cleveland Pain Dealer)
Francisco Villa is such a playful fel
low that one may almost regret mo
mentarily that the "dead or alive" edict
was issued against him. It might seem
coldly unemotional to cut him down in
the midst of his bubbling playfulness
One may imagine his cute rhetorical
flings at Carranza a fid others as he
its with his admiring followers after
i day of strenuous murder, loot and
irson. He is remarkably clever with
Iiis persiflage and his repartee, it is
claimed.
A new evidence of Villa's abounding
good humor is recorded in recent des
patches from Chihuahua. The bandit
it is declared, has put on exhibition
diversified collection of ears cut
from the heads of Villa victoms and
plaintakingly pickled, for the benefit
of posterity. This incident shows
how much more of a humorist this
roving cut-throat is than has been
commonly recognized. We have been
thinking of him as merely a clever,
personally likable murderer, highway
man and general pug-ugly. He
more.
Wariors of carier days put the heads
of their victims on poles as a warning
to others who might contcmplte chal
lenging their authority. To another
school dangling scalps best bespoke
military prowess. Human teeth have
sometimes been esteemed trinkets by
those who extracted them from an
enemy without the formality of an in
vitation. Villa, student of history and
psychology, if not of othography, re
vives the best traditions of medieval
blood thirstiness. But his special de
light is cars.
A person is supposed to express
himself freely in play. The effervescent
Villa uses the severed pickled ears of
his defeated enemies to express his
philosophy of life.
Frank Cupples returned Wednes
day from southern California. Mr.
Cupples visited Los Angeles, San Die
go and other points. He traveled
both ways by automobile and had a
splendid trip.
W. E. Woodcock and family left
Tuesday for Baker City where Mr.
Woodcock has accepted a position in
the Mutual Creamery plant of that
city. He was employed at the Co
operative Creamery here.
Swain Beaty returned Wednesday
night from Billings, Mont., where he
had been with a shipment of horses.
Mr. and Mrs. P. O'Conner and
children visited at Smith's Ferry Sun
day.
MISS BRYDEN MAKES A
CALDWELLPEOPLE
Miss Catherine T. Bryden, candidate
or the Republican nomination for
state superintendent of schools, was in
the city Tuesday for a few hours.
Miss Bryden is the county superinten
dent of schools of Latah county and
' as been for five terms. She is very
popular in her home county as is
apparent by her record.
Miss Bryden met a great many peo
ple in Caldwell and made a good im
pression with the earnest common
sense and practical manner in which
he discussed school and educational
natters.
Miss Bryden is not the candidate of
any other person, or of any clique
in or out of the state house. She is
before the people on lier merits and
upon her own responsibility.
She assflres the people that if elect
ed she will administer her office care
fully and efficiently, as she has the
superintendent's office of Latah
county.
Opinion of Neighbors
The citizens of Moscow have paid
Miss Bryden a splendid compliment
and one which can be taken at is face
value by the people of the state. The
folowing resolutions were adopted by
the Bryden Club of Moscow which
now has about 1,000 members.
"Whereas Miss Catherine T. Bry
den has announced herself as a can
didate for state superintendent of pub
lic instruction;
"We, the citizens of Moscow and
Latah county, her neighbors, associ
ates and co-workers, independent of
party affiliations, in mass-convention
assembled knowing best her qualifi
cation, worth and ability, and valuable
and devoted services to the city, coun
ty and state in her educational work,
do hereby
"Resolved, That we recommend Mis s
Bryden to the voters of the state of
Idaho as a lady of superior intellect
ual and educational attainments, hav
ing had long varied and succcssful ex
perience in educational work, possess
ed of rare executive ability; original,
zealous and forceful in her methods
and in every way qualified to discharge
the duties of the high office to which
she aspires with credit to herself and
the state."
CAPTAIN DAVIS WILL SPEAK
IN CALDWELL SATURDAY
Open Air Meeting Will be Addressed
Republican Candidate
Captain E. G. Davis will be in Cald
well Saturday. He will speak from
his car on the street Saturday evening
at 8 o'clock. This address will be in
line with the discussion of state af
fairs which the Captain has been mak
ing over the state.
Captain Davis writes that he will
try to make two talks In case there
are many people in town Saturday.
One address will be in the afternoon
about 4 o'clock and the second in the
evening.
The people of Caldwell are urged
to hear Captain Davis. He will have
something to say which will be of
interest to the voters of Caldwell.
MAINSPRING AND MAINSTAY
You probably pride yourself on be.
ing the mainspring and mainstay of
your family. And rightfully so! But
when the mainspring stops, the stay

Your energy, brains and industry make
the wheels go around, producing an
income for the family with regularity
and precision. Some day you. as the
mainspring, will come to a dead stop
But the family income need not then
stop if you will take precaution and
invest in an Equitable Income Policy
which will continue an income to you r
loved ones for life. The Equitable
will then bfcome the mainspring and
the mainstay of your family. Apply

RELIEF ABANDONED
Legislation recently enacted by
Congress providing a permanent fund
fo r the relief of dependents of mem
bers of the national guard now on the
border has caused the committee in
charge of rainsing the fund for Com
pany G to abandon the plan for the
time being. Those who subscribed
will be under no further obligation
and cash paid in will be refunded or
applied as the donor desires.
The committee point out that the
members of the company are in need
of money for the purchase or neces
sities not provided by the government
and anyone wishing to subscribe may
forward their contribution to the lad

IRRIGATED PASTURES FOR
RECLAMATION PROJECT
Washington, D. C., Aug. 8.—The
best agricultural development of the
northern reclamation projects depends
upon the establishment of live stock
industries, according to a circular on
of irrigated pasturi
I'litly
issued by the Bureau of Plant Indus
try of the U. S. Department of Ag
riculture to meet a demand for infor
mation on this subject. The use of
irrigated pastures as summer feed, par
ticularly for dairy cattle and sheep,
is almost imperative on these projects
because of the scarcity and high cost
of labor during the summer. This
need becomes increasingly acute as the
number of stock increases and the
area of unfilled land on and near the
farm decreases.
The information in the circular is
based 011 experiments conducted dur
ing several years by Federal and State 1
agencies at the Huntley, Mont., Scot
stbluff, Neb., and Belle Fourche, S. D.,
field stations, and at the Gooding,
Idaho, Experiment Station, by îhe
University of Idaho; and on ob
servations made during the past four
years 011 eleven northern reclamation
projects.
There is reason to believe that,
while the carrying capacity and meth
ods followed vary on the different
farms under observation, with good
management an acre of pasture will
support two cows on their equiva
lent in other live stock for from four
tp six months'each year,, depending
on the location of the project. It also
appears that under favorable local
conditions and proper care, the stock
carrying capacity of these pastures
could be increased somewhat from
year to year.
Farmers in the Salt Lake Valley
of Utah have found that irrigated
pastures are profitab^ on land which
is valued at $200 an acre. A dairy
farmer in the Snake River Valley of
Idaho reports that his irrigated pas
ture carries three cows per acre.
The value of such pasturage can be
stated in terms of hay replacement.
Two cows will consume approximately
a ton of alfalfa hay each month. Ii
this hay is valued at $5 a ton, the
hay replacement value of an acre of
irrigated pasture would be $5 a month
The length of the pasture seasion
varies from four to six months, de
pending on the climatic conditions on
the different projects. Hence the hay
replacement value of an acre of good
pasture can be estimated at from $20
to $30 a year. These hay-replacement
values would, of course, be greater
when the price of hay exceeded $5
a ton. In connection with this, it is
important to consider the fact that
the use of pastures requires much less
labor that the feeding of hay and that
good pasture is at least equal to, if
not better than, hay as feed for cows.
Such returns as these fully justify the
use of some of the best land on the
farm for irrigated pasture
Not all farmers who have tried
irrigated pastues have obtained satis
factory results, but in most cases the
failures have been due to the causes
which might have been prevented. One
common error is the belief that the
pasture should occupy that part of the
farm which does not produce satis
factory yields of farm crops. Many
have attempted to produce pasture on
shallow soil or land that is rocky
and unsuited for pasturage. Careless
preparation of soil and poor seed are
also common causes of failure. Low
carrying capacity frequently is due to
the fact that only grasses are used,
whereas it is desirable to include one
of two clovers. Overstocking par
ticularly during the first year, graz
ing when the soil is too wet, and in
adequate or improper irrigation are
other explanations of lack of success,
The circular devotes considerable
attention to selection of locations for
pastures, preparation of the land, the
importance of using fertile and pro
ductive soil, making provision for
proper preparation of seed bed. Under
the subject of the seed bed, the au
tlior writes:
"The seed bed should be carefully
prepared and made firm and smooth,
so that a satisfactory stand can be
secured. It is ordinarily better to
provide plenty of moisture in the soil
before seeding time than to seed in
a dry soil and irrigate immediately
afterwards. This is true particularly
of heavy soil on which a tough crust
is likely to form after irrigation and
interfere with the emergency of the
young plants. On light soils, how
ever, where the upper 3 to 4 inches
dries out very rapidly, it frequently
is necessary to seed in dry soil and
to irrigate immediately after seeding.
In such instances the use of the cor
rugation method of irrigation during
the first year is particularly desirable,
and the land should be prepared ac
cordingly."
Regarding pasture crops the publi
cation says:
"There are in use in irrigated pas
tures a variety of crops in almost in
numerable combinations. In the great
majority of cases, however, the best
results are secured with a mixture of
clover. Sweet clover alone is used to
some extent on a number of the pro
jeets, but no information lias been
secured which appears to warrant any
grasses for irigated pastures. Some
cases of sweet-clover bloat have been
reported and it has not been possible
to secure any reliable data showing
that sweet clover has a, high carrying

NEWELL STATED WATER
NOT EXCEED $25
PER ACRE
A very interesting meeting of the
board of directors of the Boise Water
L sers association was held Tuesday
At this meeting the committee ap
pointed to secure legal counsel re
ported that progress was being made.
During the progress of the discus
sion Secretary W. L. Girard pointed
out that former Director F. H. New
ell of the Reclamation Service had
'publicly syited that water for the
Boise project would not cost to ex
ceed $25.00 per acre.
Mr. Newell visited Boise in 1904 and
at that time made the statement. Lat
er in the year Mr. Neweli reported
he results of his visit to the govern
ment projects to congress. This re
port was published as Circular No.
247 and copies of the report are ltv
the hands of settlers.
Important Document
The directors consider tile Newell
report a most important document as
xes beyond question the fact that
•.bout $25.00 was the estimate of the
Reclamation Service of the cost or
water on this project. The board of
lirectors of the Water Users' associ
ation is gathering data and evidence
which will be presented at a later date
when formal action is started to have
the price of water fixed at approxi
mately the early estimates.
Othe r Project# Interested
Other government projects find
themselves in the same condition as
the Boise project. The final cost is
thre and four time as great as at
first estimated. These projects are
laying thci r complaints before the De
partment of the Interior and will
probably lay them before Congress.
The other projects have notified
the Secretary of the Boise associa
tion of their determination to fight
for the early estimates and offer to
;o.operate in whatever manner they
can.
There are government projects In
17 western states. All of these pro
jects fighting for the same end are go
ing to make their efforts felt in Con
gress and elsewhere.
Routine Business Transacted
After the more, or less Interesting
discussion of the employment ot
ounscl and the Newell report the
board of directors transacted the rou
tine business and adjourned.
ture crop for cattle or sheep can not
be recommended for the northern pro
jects, because alfalfa so frequently
causes loss from bloat. On one of
the projects, 55 per cent of the cattle
lost during the year 1915 are known
to have died from alfalfa bloat. Losses
sustained by farmers and in experi.
ments of the Office of Western Irri
gation Agriculture of the Bureau of
Plant Industry indicate that it is not
safe to use even a small quantity of
alfalfa seed in pasture mixtures. From
the information at present available
there seems to be no doubt that its ad
visable to confine the selection of
pasture crops to the grasses and
clovers.
'There is little uniformity at pre
sent as to the kinds of grasses and
lovers used. Some pastures contain
only a single grass and no clover,
while others have as many as seven
or eight grasses and two or three
clovers. The use of single grass or of
several grasses without clover is con
sidered inadvisable, largely because of
low carrying capacity. The use of
several grasses which have different
habits of growth and different tem
perature requirements assures more
nearly continuous growth throughout
the season. For example, some gras
ses will grow better during the cool
weather or in times of water shortage
than other grasses which, on the other
hand, may make rapid growth when
the temperature is high or when wa
ter is abundant.
"The two clovers most commonly
used with the grasses are white and
alsike. sometimes one and sometimes
both being used. Difficulty occasion
ally results from clover bloat where
the clover has ben seeded too heavily
or where the conditions are especially
favorable to its growth, as they are 011
some of the projects. Where the pas
ture crops include several grasses and
where not to exceed two pounds per
acre of either clover seed is used, the
danger of bloat is not likely to be ser
ious. In the selection of crops for
irigated pastures, provisions should al
ways be made for variety and high
carrying capacity, md this necessi
tates the use of at least one clover
and preferably more than oik grass."
The bulletin then devotes several
pages to pastures and mixtures for
various soils, method of seeding, irri
gation, and management.
