VOLUME XXVIII
LAST KNOWN SURVIVOR
OF INDIAN WAR DEAD
» W. Martin, Uncle of T. O. Martin,
pied Here Tuesday—Member of
Oregon Volunteers and Par
' * ticipated in Famous • Battle
of the Walla Walla !
The last survivor of the Indian
war of the fifties, so far as can be I
ascertained, passed away in Pullman
last Tuesday when T. XV. Martin, |
uncle of T. C. Martin, tho implement
man, died at the home of his nephew j
from old age, after having lived a j
useful and patriotic life of 83 years, |
two months and 19 days. The body,
was taken overland to Washtucna,'
the former home of Mr. Martin, j
Wednesday, and buried there after ]
a funeral service In which old friends i
for miles about participated. Mr. |
Martin had resided in Pullman for i
the past six years, but had become |
so enfeebled by his heavy burden of i
years that he remained constantly at'
home, the big majority of Pullman I
people thus being denied the privi- !
lege of cultivating the acquaintance
and friendship of a man who en- j
dured untold hardships smd faced the j
deadly fire of the Indians that his '
fellow countrymen might make use;
of the hundreds of thousands of acres ,
of rich farming land which the red- :
.kins defended with their lives.
At the age of 19 years Mr. Martin
left Illinois and came west, engaging
In mining in California and later go
ing to Oregon. Three years later Mr.
Martin answered the call of Governor
Curry of Oregon for volunteers to as
sist in quieting the Indians in var
ious parts of Washington and was a
member of a command of 500 men J
under Lieutenant Colonel J. K. j
Kelly, known as the Oregon Volun
teers. Forces of regular soldiers had
been in the field for some time, but
their operations were at best half
hearted and the task assigned to the j
Oregon patriots was a hard one in- j
deed. The command left The Dalles,
Oregon, late in November, 1855,1
reaching Wallula on December 2,
where they found the fort destroyed
and the Indians scattered.
The command proceeded up the
Walla Walla river to the Touchet, I
and on December's was met by Peu- j
Peumoxmox, the traitorous alia !
Walla chieftain, himself. The Indian
chief carried a flag of truce and
claimed that his followers desired
Peace, stating that he would return
to the white soldiers the following 1
day with a proposal for a treaty. '
Questioning the sincerity of the fa-1
mous chief, who was known as the
"Yellow Serpent," he was required to 1
remain with the white command. j
Under pretext that he desired to com
municate with his command to pre
pare for peace, the Indian chieftain
really sent word to clear the camp,
»Wch was located in a deep revine,
of women and children, and prepare
to do battle with the white soldiers.
After a parley which lasted two days,:
the Oregon Volunteers moved toward |
"hitman mission, where they expect
•J to make winter camp.
Soon after crossing " the Touchet'
«r, however, the battle of the.
Walla Walla, which has gone down j
in history as one of the fiercest of
toe Indian encounters, commenced,
ttg'ng all the way up the Walla
Walla valley until December 10,
»hen the Indians were dispersed,
during the four days' battle Chief
"upeumoxmox, who had been kept a
Prisoner under guard, was massacred
9 the volunteers, removing one of
°c most traitorous and cunning
Weftains of that day. The volun- ;
teers had secured an old howitzer j
"■om the abandoned and Wrecked j
jort at Wallula, and the fourth time j
"> Piece was discharged it explod
*••,killing Mr. Martin's captain, A.
• Wilson, and several others. The
regon Volunteers were greatly out
numbered in the long running fight,
■M their bravery is still made the
9l).ect of commendation.
The winter of 1855 was a hard j
one and Mr. Martin told tales al-j
™°»t unbelievable of hardship and
Offering while the volunteers were
*m »ed on Snake river, with scant
£T er,n S to protect them from the
r vlQ 8 snows and 20-below-zero
y*». and nothing but wild on
-0 &nd horse flesh for food at
times.
The Pullman Herald
Devoted to the best interests of Pullman and the beat farming community in the Northwest surrounding it.
With the breaking of spring the
command moved to the Yakima val
ley, where several stubborn bands of
red skins were dispersed, and re
turned to The Dalles in April, after
accomplishing far greater results
than had the regular soldiers.
Mr. Martin returned east after his
Indian campaign and was married
there, but no children were born to
the union. With T. W. Martin in
the Indian campaign was also his
brother, the father of T. C. Martin,
and upon the latter's death later the
son, T. 0., then only two years old,
was taken by his uncle and raised
to manhood. He came to Washing
ton state 33 years ago, locating at
Washtucna and remaining there un
til six years ago, when he came to
Pullman with his nephew.
Deceased was a close friend of tin
late William Painter of Walla Walla,
also a veteran of the Indian war, and
harrowing tales of the fierce strug
gles flew thick and fast when the
two gentlemen came in contact.
The last survivor, so far as known,
of the famous battle of the Walla
Walla is dead; the man who placed
his life in 'jeopardy and endured
hardships, the relating of which al
most turn the blood cold, has passed
to his just reward, but it can be
truthfully said (that the world "is
vastly better off for his having lived.
What better tribute could be desired?
STATIC ELECTRICITY
LARGELYRESPONSIBLE
Experiment Station Head Tells the
Chamber of Commerce of Station
Investigations of Separator
Explosions
t
"Static electricity is very largely,
if not wholly, responsible for the
ignition of the dust and air mixture
which causes explosions and fires in
threshing machines," said Dr. Ira D.
Cardiff, director of the state experi
ment station, in an address concern
ing the station investigations of sep
arator fires before the Chamber of
Commerce last Tuesday. The speak
er scouted the incendiarism theory,
which is still advanced by some farm
ers, and stated that in the station's
investigations they had never been
able to cause an explosion or igni
tion by throwing matches into the
machine. Two years ago, he said,
when the theory of Incendiarism was
quite generally popular, the station
hired expert detectives to make a
comprehensive investigation. But
one arrest resulted and that man was
sent to the Idaho penitentiary at
Boise. Later Investigations and evi
dence tended to prove the innocence
of the man, and Dr. Cardiff stated
that he is now reasonably satisfied
that the man is not guilty and that
steps to secure his release will be
taken if further investigations of the
case warrant.
"Sparks from rocks or sand," said
Dr. Cardiff, "are not hot enough to
cause a separator fire. A hotter In
candescent spark than those caused
by rocks or sand striking the cylin
ders is required to cause a fire."
Dr. Cardiff told of a critical test
to which the station's fire extinguish
er system was recently put when a
quantity of straw inside of an impro
vised separator was saturated with
gasoline, which is much more com
bustible than smut or dust. After
the fire had gained considerable
headway the system was brought into
play and the fire was totally extin
guished in less than two minutes.
The speaker branded as "criminal
negligence" the running of a separ
ator without adequate fire protection
and stated that the installation of a
fan above or behind the cylinder to
prevent the smut from spreading
through the separator and coming in
contact with the grain is even more
imperative than installing an extin
guisher system. The prevention of
the spread of the smut alleviates to
a great extent the danger of explo
sions or fires in the separator, results
in a better grade of grain and pre
vents the spread of the smut spores
to other fields.
Sixty requests for the free plans
and specifications for the college ex
tinguisher system have already been
received by the station staff and the
farmers as a general rule are show
ing an Inclination to provide ade
quate protection for their machines.

SHERIFFS FORGE DEPLETES
PULLMAN'S BAY RUM GANG
Seven Arrested for Drunkeness and Taken^to
Colfax to Serve Sentences—Many Empty
Bottles Were Found in Searches
Pullman's notorious "bay rum
gang" was depleted yesterday after
noon when Sheriff Cole and Deputy
Sheriff Williams, assisted by local of
ficers, rounded up a bunch of seven
men, who were given sentences on
the county rock pile»when taken be
fore Justice George Henry and were
'taken to Colfax by. .automobile last
[night to begin serving the sentences.
The men were charged with drunk
eness, some of them having created
[ disturbances Wednesday evening at
| the revival meetings and elsewhere.
The seven men appeared in court late
yesterday afternoon in various de
grees of drunkeness, and each was
perfectly willing to admit that he had
imbibed too freely. The four men
who were picked up Wednesday
evening by local officers after creat
ing disturbances were James McDon
ald, Carl Hansen, Martin Johnson
and L. N. Cody, and a sentence of 30
days.was handed out to each member
of the quartet. Harry Smith, Walt
Berry and Tom Durgan, who were
arrested yesterday, each drew a 15-
I day term.
Bay rum drunks have become a
: public nuisance during the past few
weeks, and a number of ladies have
been made the objects of insulting re
marks. The cleanup by the peace of
ficers was a thorough one, and will
probably mean the disorganization of
the gang. .
Sheriff Cole searched the J. C.
O'Kelly blacksmith shop, the Alton
hotel and the Pullman lodging house
for evidence of illicit sales of intoxi
cants, and at each place found large
quantities of empty bottles, the
greater part of them bearing bay
rum labels, although some bore pre
scription labels, written by Pullman ,
physicians. One label, attached to
a pint bottle which had apparently
contained a mixture of intoxicants,
was evidently written by the physi
cian himself and probably had never
gone through a drug store.
At the O'Kelly blacksmith shop at
least two dozen empty bottles were
found under a loose board in the
floor of the office, most of the con
tainers bearing bay rum labels. At
the Alton hotel a dozen "empties"
were found, one of them bearing the
label of a loial physician, with the
directions, "To be taken three times
a day before meals." Another bot
tle bore this direction: "Rub on
limbs after violent exercise." The j
search at the Pullman lodging house
resulted in the confiscation ot an
other batch of "empties," but no bot
tles containing liquor were found at
any of the three places.
Prosecuting Attorney Burgunder,
Sheriff Cole and Deputy Sheriff
Williams were non-committal as to
the possibilities of other charges
growing out of the evidence gathered
in the three raids.
1 Pt I.I.MAN HOY TENOR
TO APPI.AU IN CONCERT
Theodore Karle Johnson Will Give
k. 1 it.ii Under Auspices Pullman
Hand —Mas Gained World
I.en own
Theodore Karle Johnson, a former
Pullman boy, now one of the best
tenor soloists in the country, will
probably appear in concert here some
time before September 15, if plans of !
the Pullman band materialize. The
noted tenor, who is a son of Mrs. A.
B. Ford of Pullman, will visit the
Northwest in the early fall and will j
give two or three recitals before re-
I turning to New York, where he will
join one of the most widely known' [
opera companies. The cost of stag- l
ing one Of these recitals here would
I be in the neighborhood of $165, and
the chamber of commerce has
pledged Its support to the band in
making the attraction a financial
success. j
The famous tenor recently made
several records for the Vlctrola com
-1 puny, which aroused unusual Inter
est in Pullman and may be heard at
Watts Pharmacy. The fact that
Johnson is well known here, having
I been a student in the grade schools, I
and Is recognized as a tenor with few
peers, should assure a big attendance
!at the recital and result in a sub- ]
stantial profit for the band.
PULLMAN IS AFTER
BANKERS MEETING
Efforts Will Be Made to Bring Meet
ing of State' Bankers' Association
Here Next Year— Would
.Mean Seven Hundred
Visitors
______ ,
Seven hundred bankers of the
state of Washington, comprising the
State Bankers' association, may come
to Pullman next June for the annual
ithree-days session as a result of the I
the activity of the local chamber of
I commerce, which was prompted by a
suggestion dropped by XV. EC. Han-
Ison, state bank examiner, and form
erly a prominent Pullman citizen.
"The slate bankers are becoming
| deeply Interested In agriculture,"
said Mr. Hanson, "and the holding
!of the next annual convention here '
: would result in great good to all con- '
corned. The visitors would have an
opportunity of visiting the state's '
1 great agricultural school, coming in •■ I
j touch with its work and its scope,
and listening to valuable agricultural I
I discourses by the college experts. On I'
I the other hand the city of Pullman 1
and the college would profit in a ■
great degree through the publicity '
j given to the town and institution, re
sulting in added students and at the '
; same time added revenue for the
city."
Upon motion, which carried unani-
I mously, the president of the chamber ]
was authorized to appoint a commit
] tee to have the matter in charge and '
every effort will be made to secure |
I the big meeting for Pullman. The
: executive committee of the associa
: tion meets in Spokane in December,
'at which time a selection of the 1917
I meeting place will be made. In case
[ Pullman fails in Its efforts to secure I
the convention, attempts to secure a ' I
one-day excursiop of the bankers to j i
Pullman and the college on one day j ]
of the meeting will be made. M
Mr. . Hanson expressed surprise,
but keen gratification at the great
amount of improvement work which
has been done In Pullman since his
residence here, and stated that Pull
man's improvements during the last j'
two years have been greater than '
those of any other town its size in I'
the state. '
HOI-LAX WILL SPEAK <
President E. O. Holland will speak I
at the chamber of commerce lunch- ,'
j eon next Tuesday. A large attend-' 1
I ance is desired as matters of great j '
importance to Pullman will be dis- <
cussed. ' '

Red Russian wheat $1.02
I'lub wheat 1,01
Potty fold wheat 1.00
Oats, per cwt- 1.24
Barley, |>er cwt- .. .; 1.32
The Pullman grain markets re
sembled the big eastern exchanges in
l>oint of interest and excitement
Wednesday afternoon after reports
if sensational advances in the Chi
•ago markets, due to the govern
ment's official report of short crops
md rumors of the spread of black
rust through Canada and the Da
kotas, had been received here.
Prices at once climbed skyward by
caps and bounds until the cheapest
trade of wheat was over the dollar
mark, and several grain buyers hied
hemselves to the country in an ef
fort to arouse a selling interest
nnong the farmers. The total sales
for the day, all for one dollar or bet
er, were probably about HO,OOO
bushels, although no sales larger
ban 11,000 bushels were reported.
Despite the sensational ■ advances
some farmers refuse to consider of
fers, believing that the advance will
•ontlnue.
Local grain men estimate that at
east 300,000 bushels o! the new
a beat crop In the immediate vicln
ty of Pullman, or over one-half the
ixpected crop in this vicinity, is al*
■eady under contract, many largo
tales having been made the latter
>art of last week at between 90 and
15 cents.
Yesterday's quotations were the
tame as those of Wednesday, al
hough offers of as high as $1.05
ire claimed to have been made for
lew club wheat, but the market had
luieted clown considerably and there
vas evidence of loss anxiety to buy
iii the part of the dealers and less
nclinatlon to sell on the part of the
emalnlng holders.
The following sales are reported
o have been made Wednesday after
ioon and evening:
' M. W. Whitlow-— I 1,000 bushels
