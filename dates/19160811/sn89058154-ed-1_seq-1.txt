KANSAS AND THE MILK COW
Almost I Million Dairy Cows in
v the State Now
i
2 LETTER S

k'm'mm'm'msvwm'.'s.'ww
Kansas has almost 1 million dairy
cows. ' Four years ago the'' KanBas
Agricultural College sent out a spe
cial dairy train over same of the Kan
Bas railroads, in which lecturers told
the farmers that a silo and a few old
cows would produce real money every
day of the year and would be found
to be the most regular and profitable
business on any farm. , That was
something new to Kansas.
Just at that time the farmers were
ready to try the advice of these ex
perts. The dairy train came just
when Kansas was experiencing the
worst drought in thirty years. The
corn had been burned np and only the
sorghums made crops.
' In the last five years the number of
milch cowa in Kansas bas increased
almost 50 per cent. According to the
returns of the assessors to the state
board of agriculture there were 641,
570 milch cows in the state last year.,
In 1915 there were 9G1.281, an in
crease of more than three hundred
thousand. '
No statistics were available until
1915 on the number of cream sepa
rators in the state. In that year the
assessors were required to learn the
number. They found a little more
than seventy thousand. The . returns
already reported indicate that there
will be more than eighty thousand
cream separators this year.
"Dairying is only in its infancy in
Kansas now," said S. C. Mohler, secre
tary of the state board of agriculture.
"It is only in the last few years the
farmers have learned of the never
ending income from a few cows. In
quiries as to where to obtain good
dairy cattle have increased so much
in the last ten months we have di
rected the county assessors in every
Kansas county to report to this de
partment a list of farmers with pure
bred dairy cattle for sale. We made
the same inquiry in regard to beef
cattle, but there has not been the
same demand for information on beef
cattle as there has been for, milk
breeds."
The above, from the Kansas City
Star, ought to be an eye opener for
pur people. If Kansas can make
money, out of milch and beef cattle,
McNairy county can. We are glad to
note a few of the live fanners are
going into the business. Why not a
great number? The more engaged
in such an industry, the better for all

The theatrical element in New York
is a small world within itself, embrac-
ng numberless places of amusement,
ranging from the nickel-movie to the
great Metropolitan Grand Opera
House, where last winter they wanted,
at the lowest price, six dollars a seat
to hear the real big things that were
given; such as Wagner's operas.
This is the place where the big at
tractions come first, 'and a reputation
made here means a national reputa
tion. To say that a play ran 100
nights in New York is enough to
stamp it as something extraordinary,
but not necessarily very good, from a
moral standpoint. New York loves
to laugh, and can stand some pretty
tough performances, if they are only
funny, but there is such a thing as
police censorship here, and a play or
picture that is too much off color
will be put down pretty quick. To
know just how far to go in that re
spect is a science of itself.
I have seen and heard two of the
greatest stage stars that ever played
this country: The American, Joe
Jefferson, and the Frenchwoman,
Sarah Bernhardt. I saw Jefferson in
his favorite play of "Rip Van Winkle,"
Washington city, a good many
years ago, but the impression he made
upon me is fresh to-day. My father,
mother and I went to see him. They
both said the same thing of him, and
thought it was the best criticism I
ever heard of an actor: You forgot
that he was acting, and it seemed as
though Old Rip himself were there,
and that what you saw before you
was an actual bit of life. ,You forgot
the stage and the curtain, and the
theater itself, and , saw only the
drowsy little town, or the mountain
ook up in the Catskills, where Rip
slept for twenty years. It took a lot
of science to dress Rip in such flimsy
rags in a way to keep them from fall
ing on mm. in spite oi tne rags
and the decrepit age that came over
Rip during his two decades of slum
ber, you could recognize the same old
easy-going, happy-go-lucky loafer
that his wife had driven away so long
ago. ma voice seemed to come from
a toothless mouth (these great actors
do not forget anything that goes to
make their art perfect), but you
could tell it was Rip' speaking. Jef
ferson was the son and grandson of
abactor, and was practically raised
on the stage. That, and his great
native talent for the stage, made him
perhaps the greatest American actor
since the days of Edwin Booth.
It will be remembered tha't John
Wilkes Booth, who killed Abraham
Lincoln, was a brother of the cele
brated Edwin, and that their father,
Junius Brutus Booth, was one of the
early glories of the American, stage
The miserable assassin did the deed in
ord's Theater, on Tenth street, in
Washington, a. building I have often
seen. Ihe shot. was hred on April 14,
805, and from that date, the great
actor Edwin Booth never appeared in
Washington. He held his superb
place on the stage for many years,
and his acting of Shakespeare's II am-
et is said never to have been sur
passed. Mo doubt the deep sorrow
of his brother's infamy made the role
of the melancholy Dane peculiarly
appropriate to him.
it was with a good deal of curios-
ty that I awaited an opportunity to
see barah Hernhardt, the Greatest
living actress. I saw her at a Balti
more theater five years ago, in her
favorite play of "Camille." It is not
a nice story: A' fallen woman, who
had lost all heart, apparently, for
everything that was good and holy.
fell in love with a man named Ar
mand, one of her chance acquaintanc
es family disowned him when
they found out the romance, but he j
returned her love, however, which was
cut short by her early death from
consumption. The play, which was
written by Alexander Dumas the
Younger, throws a glamor of poetry
and nobility over a very sordid life,
and is decidedly and peculiarly
French, but when played by Sarah
Bernhardt it became a work of the
highest art, and one could see only
the better spirit of the poor lost girl
who died giving at lost a pure love to
the man she could not marry..
Whea I saw her, Sarah Bernhardt
was over Bixty-five years old, and I
had always read that she was thin and
skinny in appearance. You can
imagine mv surprise when she stepped
on the stage looking like a girl of
twlnty, not only young and fresh and
spry, but plump and even rather fat.
was near enough to the stage to
catch every word she said. The play
was in French from beginning to end,
but so crystal-clear was the pronunc
iation of the great actress and her
talented players that even a moderate
knowledge of the language would en
able one to follow the play. It was
with great interest that I noticed the
manner in which this supreme artist
handled her native language, and to
see just how she acted. She had ap
peared in this one play perhaps a
thousand times, and her acting wal
very much like that of Jefferson, so
unstudied and matter-of-fact that it
seemed as though it had always been
just that way, and could be no other
way.
Sarah's eyes struck me with won
derment. They were shaded under
the lower lids in a way to make them
ook much larger than ordinary eyes;
I never saw eyes like that before or
since. It . looked ( uncanny at first.
Occasionally there was that little
hacking cough of consumption, and
an increasing languor of manner and
movement in the suffering woman.
who, however, still kept up herjspirits
and only at the very last gave up
hope. Sarah would be talking in an
ordinary tone, lounging in a lovely
evening gown in her garden; sudden
ly, she would spit out some word in a
manner that reminded one of a tiger
or of a great, spiteful cat; so unex
pected and unlikely that it was start
ling; then it was all playful smiles
and sweet words again. I loved to
hear Sarah say the word "maintenant"
meaning "now" in French, the last
syllable ending in a sound of very
nasal character, totally nnlike En
glish): the first syllable came out
slowly as usual Jbut the end of the
word came as quick as the crack of a
whip; and to hear her pronounce the
name of St. Gaudens, one of the char
acters, was a study in itself. French
is a beautiful, musical language, but
after thirty years' practice in France,
many Americans have been unable to
master all the intricacies of the ac
cent and pronunciation. It is far
more perfect than English in its
capacity for expressing human
thought, but hardly has the vigor of
English. ' The editor of the New York
Telegram told me recently that when
he was in Paris pome months ago he
was'startled by hearing some one in
the office of the War Department
swearing in English. Then he discov
ered that it was the French War
Minister himself, who appologized and
said that no language under the sun
was so well adapted to swearing as the
English; and he had enough to make"
him "cuss" every hour of the day.
Sarah Bernhardt had a clear, musical
voice, and exactly .the manners and
movements of a fcirl of twenty or a
little over, although she had a grand
son nearly grown.
' I saw pictures of Sarah Bernhardt
taken last year, after she had lost a
leg from blood-poisoning. She acted
for a moving picture, and it was so
arranged that she never had to stand
alone, but was mostly shown sitting
down. Just why a woman who has
made millions of dollars should still,
in her old and suffering age, want to
act for money, is hard to understand,
except for the passion, which is strong
nntil death with some people, to be
gathering in gold.
The stage, like everything else in
the fine arts, seems to have degener
ated to a dead level of mediocrity.
Nobody ever plays any more for the
sake of art; the dollar is the only
inspiring spirit, and that of course
means that the heart is not touched
nor the mind illumined, as in the days
of Garrick, Siddons, Booth and Jeffer
son. It is the same with poets, musi
cians and writers of books. Possibly
the great war in Europe will reveal
great minds and great artists. The
world needs them as never before in
history.

Tells of Old-Time Music and Dancing
Say, Tobe, don't you remember the tunes they used to play?
I shore haint heard sich music fer many and many a day.
Have you forgot them frolics, when all the gals and boys
Was dancin by the board-light and makin sich a noise
till the old folks couldnt sleep none, and we went out to the batn?
Fer this here modern music, I wouldnt give a darn.
We had a blind old nigger that died before the war.
The folks, to hear him fiddle would, come from near and far.
I would go without my supper ruther than miss his playin;
As plain as any talkin, that fiddle was a-sayin:
"First upon the heel-tap and then upon the toe,
Every time I turn around I jump Jim Crow".
Then come the Arkansas Traveler, a-rumblin'on the bass:
"Big Butch, Little Butch, Stump and Old Case."
Then a tune of the plantation would fetch me every time; .
It shore was purty music, though it wasnt much fer rime:
"Old Sicky Blueskin, what ye got fer supper?
Chicken foot, sparrow grass, hominy and butter."
Another was my favorite, a, regular nigger tune;
They danced it in the medder, under the summer moon:
"0 come along. Jim along Josie,v
0 Jim along, come along Joe.
Ole Massa Joe fc
Aint wuffah cent;
Drudder be a niggah dan a po white man."
I was fond of still another, the old Virginia reel;
When that was started up, it put fever in my heel:
"Who's been here since I been gone? "
Purty little gal with a red dress on.
Look to the east and look to the west; '
Choose the one that you love best."
There was one about Dan Tucker; now, how did that oue go?
Now I hunt heard that fiddled for forty years or bo.
"Old Dan Tucker come to town .
With one leg up and tother down."
Our dancin days are over; our joints are stiff and sore;
They dont have no sich dancin and sich fiddlin any more.
If I had that blind old nigger to give us a tune or two,
I'd crack my heels together and show you what I could dol
X
I hant much hope of heaven, fer I've been purty bad :
(I've cussed and drunk hard cider!) but if I only had
The hope that when I'm laid out, my soul will come once more
Back to the town of Purdy, as it was in fifty-four!
Jist let me hear that fiddlin; see the gals in calico
And the boys in homespun, dancin, jist like the long ago!
The harps of gold and angels would be mighty nice to see (
Jist give me back old Purdy that would be heaven for me!
