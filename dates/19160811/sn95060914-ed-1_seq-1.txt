are supporting him becaugfe of
past record of fair play and
justice to all the people They
are supporting him because they
know he will not override the
laws to serve his own purposes
John F Weber as the first
speaker brought out the record
of Mr Olney s long and success
ful fight to make the mining
companies and railroads pay their
just share of taxes This refutes
and disproves the statements
now being peddled around that
Mr Olney is a corporation man
There is not a man in the State
of Arizona today who has fought
the corporations as hard as Mr
Olney After their long fight
they found that his sense of fair
ness and justice was the same in
public affairs as it was in his
private affairs This spirit of
true Americanism enables him to
represent all the people of the
State
He is a successful business man
a successful cattleman and a
successful fanner He knows
from experience the true relation
between capital and labor His
worst enemies do riot claim that
it will be necessary for the legis
lature to abridge any of his
powers to prevent him from plac
ing himself above the laws of the
State It is a serious thing for
the democratic party of the State
to have a governor representing
but one class of people so that a
recall petition became necessary
Andrew Peterson has long been
interested in legislative affairs
The freak measures have pro
duced a condition of affairs that
is not conducive to a stable and
conservative government Above
all things Arizona needs a gov
ernment which will invite capital
into the State with the assurance
of fair play We have had a gov
ernment which expells capital
rather than one which welcomes
the development of our resources
That is why a change in the ex
ecutive department is imperative
The citizens of Arizona realize
the real danger in having a gov
ernor who has not paid a cent of
taxes for year3 They know that
the more taxes a man pays the
more business like he is in spend
ing the tax receipts They know
that if he is not a taxpayer at all
he is les3 liable to be very thought
ful of other peoples money
Mrs Richard Layton was given
a rousing approval when she
stated that the men and women
could do no better than to vote
for Mr Olney The women will
acquire merit as well as honor
and credit by having a man from
Graham county as governor Mr

The Amusement Hall at Eden
was filled with ardent supporters
of Mr Olney last Sunday eve
ning at a meeting of the Graham
County Olney Club
As usual a large number of
women were present The sin
cerity of the women in their
determination to cast their ballots
intelligently was shown by the
different women speakers
As point after point was brought
out the enthusiasm increased
and when it was reported that
canvasses of the voters revealed
the fact that 90 per cent of the
democrats would support Mr
Olney the audience realized that
there must be very good reasons
wny sucn a majority oi me peo
ple prefer Mr Olney
For twenty five years the citi
zens of the valley have known
Mr Olney and in all that time
there is none who could say that
they had found him dishonest in
tiy transaction On the other
hand they had found that he had
given the same painstaking at
tention to county affairs that
hegave to his own business
The men who lire supporting

interest of the State fair and is
particularly enthusiastic over the
way the Aizrona horsemen are
responding He stated that al
ready entries had been received
from a number of local horsemen
and that others have declared
their intention of entering soon
Some of the horses entered are
Irene Strathmore Miss Axworthy
Dillon Maydella and the colts
Mona Hall Pineknot and Bellze
bola owned by T E Pollock of
Flagstaff Lillian Van Mabel
Van and Gay Tommy owned by
J R Lambert of phoenix and
Zombrino and Kildare owned by
Dr J G Belt ofFhoenix
Mr Lamberts strincr are rac
ing at the present time through
the middle west and according to
the reports of Horse Journals
are rounding into excellent shape
Dr Belts pacer Zombrino
and his trotter Kildare have
been winning numerous races the
past six weeks throughout south
western Canada
In connection with the Arizona
horse program attention is called
to the fact that this years entries
for the colt races will close Sep
tember 1st a month earlier than
the other events The reason
for this is that in the event the
colt races fail to fill other races
will be substituted and adver
tised immediately
Four races are offered this year
for Arizona colts as follows
Two-year-old trot two-year-old
pace three-year-old trot three-
year old pace with a purse oi
50000 for each
It has been the policy of the
State Fair Commission in the
past to encourage the horsemen
in the State and six races are
set apart this year for Arizona

The most optimistic and
couraging reports are being
ceived from all portions of
State of the growing popularity
of George A Olney candidate
for the democratic nomination
for governor of Arizona
While this encouraging condi
tion exists as to Mr Olney there
are evidences of dissatisfaction
in the camps of the enemy
When the board of governors of
the Hunt Labor Unions Club of
Phoenix met as an auditing com
mittee recently a mighty dissen
sion arose as to who is to pay the
bills incurred under the name of
the club A professional organ
izer of clubs had been engaged
to obtain names to swell the list
of membership and he succeeded
most admirably getting it is
claimed 2000 names
If proper inducements are of
fered it does not seem to be any
trouble for him to get names to
place on the list of a club no
matter what its purpose and he
was charged with enrolling every
body he met with
From a statement of the
amount of money paid for obtain
ing these signatures the market
price seems to have been twenty
cents per the total amount ag
gregating 400 an amount which
the union men objected to paying
Primarily a labor union organ
ization many not connected with
the unions it was charged were
enrolled on the membership list
and hence the objection of the
club becoming responsible for
the expense The failure of the
professional organizer to hold a
card in any union was another
cause for complaint
With the machinery of this
club not running smoothly an
other Hunt club has been organ
ized which gives promise for
greater harmony It is called
the Economic League and its
membership consists of Leroy
Ladd secretary UTGov Hunt
and O McZandpn member of
the lax Commission and profes
sional political machine builder
In order to make it non-partisan
they took a republican mem
ber in as secretary and have en
gaged space in a local publica
tion to disseminate their political
information through
Even with the organization of
three clubs in an endeavor to se
cure the united support of or
ganized labor they have failed
to accomplish this object both in
Phoenix and Tucson where some
of the most enthusiastic workers
for the nomination of George A
Olney are found in the ranks of
the unions They are not onlv
contributing of their time but
entirely unsolicited are contrib
uting to the campaign in other
ways and those who are presum
ing on the present governor re
ceiving the solid vote of organ
ized labor are counting without
their host
With the complete refutation
of the charge that Mr Olney had
advocated the passing of the
mine tax bill and with the ex
posure of the official record of
Governor Hunt urging upon the
first State legislature the passage
of a bill identical in its provis
ions for basing the valuation of
mines for taxable purposes they
are now casting about for some
new issue to go before the peo
ple with coupled with an appeal
for votes to continue the incum
bent in office for another term
