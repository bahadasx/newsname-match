THE FEDERAL
FARM LOAN ACT
The Federal farm loan act,, pop
ularly called the "Rural credits
law," was signed by the President
and became a law on July 17; 191G.
The primary purpose of this act
is to promote agricultural prosper
ity by enabling farmers to borrow
money on farm-mortgage security
at a reasonable rate of interest and
for relatively long periods of time.
To attain this object, two- farm
mortgage systems are provided :
, (1), A system operating through
regional land banks, and (2) a sys
tem operating through joint-Btock
land banks.
To attract money to the farm
loan field the act provides a method
whereby those who have money to
. nd can find safe investment in
the form, of debentures or. bonds,
of small and large denominations,
issued by the banks and based on
the security of : mortgages on farm
lands. .
These two systems are to be un
der the general supervision a Fed
eral Farm Loan Board in the
Treasury Department, composed of
the Secretary of the Treasury, as
chairman ex. officio, and four mem
bers appointed by the President.
This board has authority to eppoint
appraisers, examiners and regis
trars, who will be public officials.
FEDERAL LAND-BANK SYSTEM.
Under the Federal land-bank
system the act provides for Feder
al land banks wtiich-make loans,
for the first 12.' months, exclusively
through local national farm-loan
association composed of borrow
ers. These associations shall be
shareholders in the banks, and in
that way the members who are the
borrowers will share in the profits
of the bank. The money for the
loans is to come partly from the
capital of the banks, and partly
from the sale by the banks of bonds
secured by first mortgages on farm
lauds. The act defines strictly the
purposes for and the oonditions
tinder which loans are to be made,
aud requires that the rate of inter
est charged on farm loans shall not
exceed 6 cent per annum.
TWELVE FEDERAL LAND DANES!
The United States shall be di
vided into 12 farm-loan districts,
and and a Federal land bank with
a subscribed capital stock of not
188 than $750,000, each -share $5,
1 shall be established in each district.
Each Federal land bank may estab
lish branches in its district. With
in 30 days after the capital stock
is offered for sale it may be pur
chased at par by anyone. There
after, the stock remaining unsold
shall be bought by the Secretary of
the Treasury for the United States.
It is provided, however, that the
Government shall not receive any
i dividends on its-stock. Ultimate
ly, it is intended that all the stock
? in the banks shall be owned by the
BBBOciations of borrowers, and pro
vision therefore is made in the law
fvr the original stock at par to
these associations. . '
FARM LOAN ASSOCIATIONS.
The act provides for the creation
of local national farm-loan associa
tions through which it is contem
plated that the Federal land banks
shall' make their loaUs. In the
event that a local loan association
" is not formed in any locality with
:u auy locality withjn a year, "the
Federal Farm Loan Board niay
a uthorize a Federal "land bank to
make loans on farm. laud through
approved. ngpnts. Tea or mose
persons who own and cultivate farm
land qualified as security for a
mortgage loan under the act, or
,who are about to own and cultivate
such land, may form such an asso'
ciatiop,-provided the aggregate of
the loans desired by the member
ship is not less than $20,000. Each
member must take stock in his as
sociation to an amouut equivalent
to 5 per cent of the amount he
wishes to borrow. This stock the
association holds in trust as secur
ity for the member's individual
loan. ' The association, in turn,
when applying for money from the
bank, must subscribe for stock in
the bank to an amount equivalent
to 5 per cent of the sum it wants to
obtain for its members. This stock
is held in trust by the bank as se
curity for the loans it makes
through .the association. . If a
prospective borrower has no money
with which to pay for his associa
tion stock,, he may borrow the
price of- that stock as a part of the
loan on his farm land, i
Under this plan; then, every
borrower must be a stockholder in
his local association, and every as
sociation a stockholder in its dis
trict bank. Each stockholder in an
association is liable for the acts of
that association up to twice the
amounts of his stock.
HOW LOANS ARE OBTAINED.
A member of the national farm
loan association, before obtaining a
loan, must first fill out an applica
tion blank supplied to the loan as
sociation by the Federal Farm
Loan Board. This application
blank and other necessary papers
will then be referred to a loan com
mittee of the association which
must appraise the property offered
as security. Such application as is
approved by the loan committee is
then forwarded to the Federal land
bank and must be investigated and
reported on by a salaried appraiser
of the bank before the loan is
granted. This appraiser is re
quired to investigate the solvency
and character of the prospective
borrower as well as the value of his
land. When a loan is granted the
amount is forwarded to the borrow
er through the loan association.
CONTINUED NEXT WEEK.

TO HECLAm 'IiA'KD
Paris, Tenu., August 3. Possi
bly one of the greatest events in
Henry County agriculture is the
proposed drainage along the east
ern border of the county . which is
determined by the Big Sandy River
and which, when completed, will
reclaim 100,000 acres of fertile
farm lands. A petition has been
filed with the Cbuuty Court for for
mal legal verification.
mence at the point in Henry Coun
ty where the Big Sandy River
flows into the Tennessee River and
extend) southward along with the
Big Sandy River through Benton
County, running out near Hollow
Rock in Carroll County. "
The proposed drainage canal
will be about 60 miles long. The
expense will be borne by the own
ers of adjacent property, 50 having
already signified their .,; willingness
to go into the proposition. It i
understood when the district or
ganization, which will probably be
styled "Bijz Sandv Drainaere Dis-

approved by the Legislature, and

Editor The Chronicle I desire
through the columns of your paper
to express my thanks to my friends
who bo loyally supported me in my
race for Trustee. , I have nothing'
but the kindest feelinc for tlmso
- o v
who opposed me. A number - of
Democratic, friends would have
supported me" but thought they
were obligated to support the nom
inee, as they voted in the primary
Some of these Democrats are very
dear to me and I have, the highest
regard for them.
Some say that my Brother Will
was a great factor in my defeat. It
might as well be said that Bob's
brother, Oscar, was the cause of
his election. Its all nonsense to
think that my brother would op
pose me,, or that Bob's brother
would oppose him. . ;
I have always thought that Mr.
Smith was a high-toned, Christian
gentlemen, and think he wilj make
an excellent Trustee. My brother
told mein our first conversation in
regard to Mr. Smith that he was a
gentleman- in every respect. I
endeavored to make a clean race
and have nothing to regret and de
sire the friendship of every Demo
crat and Republican in the county,
Yours truly,
z Virgil Morris.
