Newton declared that coast guard
cutters are too slow, most of them

should be provided, he believes. He

The coast guard saves $4.."n worth
of property for every $1 expended

Mr. Newton says the primary need
for faster cuttes is to enable the

a heavy projectile. charged with
gelatine, but has a range of only

WOT TO OPPOSE
General Manager Hardy Says
His Company Agrees to
Safety Measure.
The Chicago, Sou.h Bend and
Northern Indiana Railway Co. will
not attempt to have the Indiana pub
lic service commission revoke its
crder requiring the elevation of
tracks over the Lincoln highway near
New Carlisle, according te a state
ment issued Friday morning by V. I.
Hardy, general manager of the com
pany, A suit showing why the order
either should be withdrawn or re
voked was tiled by the Chicago, Lake
Shore and South Bend 1 tail way Co.
In circuit court early this week and
it is sali that the New York Central
Railroad Co. is preparing to lile a
similar sait.
In his statement Mr. Harely points
cut that the cost of putting in the
subway will be a heavy burden to
the Northern Indiana lines, but that
the company is willing to help pro
mote public safety. In return he
asks that the public use all care to
prevent accidents at grade crossings.
Following is the statement given
out by Mr. Hardy:
"It has been decided that the Chi
cago. S'outh Rend and Northern In
diana Railway Co. will not (bring
suit to avoid the building of the New
Carlisle overway. The commission
has intimated it? willingness to agree
en a type of construction that will
be satisfactory to the general pub
lic, and as low in cost as possible for
the railroae!. Although the cost to
the railroad will be a heavy burden,
in line with iLs general policy, it
has agreed ta the elevation in eirder
to promote public safety and to tend
to lessen accidents.
I "All of the railroads and traction
l line ar-- having to spend a great deal
cf money to abolish grade crossings,
but it will be a long time before the
majority of the grade crossings can
be eliminated.
The general public
shuuhjl take all precautions possible
in approaching all grade crossings
to avoid accidents. The public should
bear in mind tha: it is much easier
for a lieht car or vehicle to he stop
ped than for a heavy electric car,
weigl.ing 0 or 60 tons, to make a
stem and avoid an accident.
"In taking this step we feel that
we are loine everything within our
power to avoid accidents, and in re
turn will ask the cooperation of the
traveling public in avoiding grade
crusting accidciitfc."

Though Woman's Party
Condemn Him. .
EXPECTS TO JUSTIFY
HIMSELF ON STUMP
Changes Portions of Accept
ance Speech to Meet Ac
cusations of Republican
Candidate Hughes.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Aug. 11. Pres't
Wilson "will stand pat" on his decla
ration that the states, and not the
nation should decide the epuestion of
suffrage. He will not declare in
favor of the proposed constitutional
amendment, the white house said to
day, even though the woman's party
national conference, now in session
in Colorado Springs, adopts resolu
tions condemning his candidacy. On
behalf of the president, the state
ment was made at the white house
today that he espoused eejual suf
frage as a state issue long before he
had even decided to become a candi
date for reelection and that he can
not change his position now to suit
the leaders of the suffrage movement
in the states here the women have
the vote.
The president's political managers
will not be surprised should the Col
erado Springs conference endorse
the candidacy of Justice Hughes, but
they insisted today that this will aid
the president in many of the big
eastern states, while he will by no
means abandon the hope that when
he again publicly explains his posi
tion he will get a goodly percentage
of the suffrage votes in the Pacific
slope states.
Changes His S pooch.
Meanwhile as Justice Hughes con
tinues his western trip, directly
charging the administration with
"political log-rolling." "violation of
the civil service," "extravagance in
ollice." and "incapacity in adminis
tering the affairs of the country,"
the bitterness in administration
circles continues. It is understood
that the president, at the suggestion
of his advisers, has made radical
changes in certain portions of his
speech of acceptance, and will prob
ably make more before the message
is delivered. The close friends of
the president declare; that he will
answer every charge made on the
stump by the republican candidates,
especially those charges which di
rectly affect his administration.
It already has been decided that
all of the cabinet officers will take
the stump as senm as the democratic
campaign is opened. They are to be
assisted by an enormous battery of
lesser fame, but it is known that the
democratic leaders- intend placing
great hopes in the stumping tour
which is to be arranged for Col. Wil
liam Jennings Rryan. This latter
trip will begin early next month and
will last until just prior to the elec
tion. Talks Politics.
The president again talked politics
with his cabinet members today. The
general issues of the campaign were
discussed and each department has
been directed to furnish materials
for carrying on an aggressive fight
rieht up to election day. Great stress
is to be put on the claim that the
present prosperity of the country is
not due to war orders. In this con
nection, the; orators of the adminis
tration will dwell on the great in
crease in the trade to South and
Central America and to Canada, and
also will call attention that already
a serious car shortage confronts the
business interests of the country due?
to the great increase in general busi
ness everywhere.
