Falling in their purpose to black- rc
mail Samuel Navarro out of $500, un
know members of a Black Hand gang
set fire to his store and residence.
The blaze was seen from the railroad re
yards by the Southern Pacific night
switching crew, and Navarro was
awakened by a waning shriek from
the locomotive whistle. The fire was be
extinguished just before it reached a SI
bucket of coal oil under the edge of th
the house. lo,
Navarro received five Black Hand TI
letters recently. The last one, writ- or
ten a week ago, demanded $500 by ce
August 1, or "something would hap- tic
pen," it sajd. Navarro paid no atten- an
tion to the letters, and does not in- ex
tend to be frightened out of the city. Ie:
"I am an American citizen," he de- fo
clared, "and I'll live in Lake Charles
till I die."
Practically every Italian merchant
in the city has received threatening
letter in the past several months and
in many cases they have been fright
ened out of the city.
Two merchants left recently after
sacrificing their business, one of them
being a man whose home and store
were destroyed by an incendiary fire
stn
last summer. Not many weeks ago
also an attempt was made to blow
up Frank Bjsaacs store 4 lyaroad w

STATE PARAGRAPHS.
The refusal of the Shreveport Rail- Re
ways Company to pay the inspection let
fee levied on all poles owned by pub- po
lic utility corporations in Shreveport, GC
by an ordinance adopted by the city bi(
council in June, precipitates a test of st,
the ordinance in the courts. The com- ,
pany's refusal to pay a claim of $16.87 an
presented by the city for the first quar- in
terly inspection of its poles was made
known in a communication turned
over to the council at the meeting
Tuesday morning by Commissioner
Leon I. Kahn. Instructions were is- an
sued to the city attorney to bring suit
to collect the fees.

Henry L. Fuqua, of Baton Rouge, re
has been appointed manager of the dr
state penitentiary by Governor Pleas- I
ant, the act of the last Legislature
which abolishes the Board of Control
and changes the management of the
penitentiary having become effective.
Mr. Fuqua was appointed president of
the Board of Control July 7, to suc
ceed WV. H. Reynaud, a Hall appointee, u
and has been serving in that capacity.
He will have absolute control of the
penitentiary system and the manage
ment of its valuable properties.
Gov. R. G. Pleasant issued a procla
mation extending the provisions of the
law on the subject of juvenile courts tl
to the parish of Grant. This procla
mation was issued in accordance with
a resolution adopted by the Grant par- T
ish police jury on June 5, 1916, in reg
ular session, making application and
requesting that the eff-ct and opera
tion of said provisions of law be ex l
tended this parish.
As a result of the construction of
Ca!casieu's model road system North
ern and Eastern capitalists have turn
ed favorable eyes toward this section.
Recently there has been a demand in
the Iast for Calcasieu parish public
securties, which hitherto have been tl
sold thlrough Chicago. Many thousands tl
of dollars of Eastern money are also b
being invested in the parish in farnm
mortgages.
Adjutant General McCrory was ad- F
vised by Major Miller at Camp Staf- L

The Ziglar Dredge Company of s5
Etherwood will finish its contract for
the Fifth ward drainage district early
in August. They have gone through i
the Hoyt ranch and are ready to a
pierce the railroad risht of wary, I
Because no appropriation for that
purpose was made by the Legislature
at the last session, near beer dealers
who have had to close up shops un
der the law barring the.ir lbuir n in
prohibition sections, v.ill lhav to wait
until after the next sessioin of the
General Asseeombly to receive their
refunds on state licenses. This is in
dicated in advic,s from Slate Aditor
('apdeville to Sheriff T. 11. lughl's,
who states:
"As you will notice In the above
(the act) no amount of money is ap
propriated or set aside to pay the
states portion of license sotughlt to t,
refunded, and no one is nut i,rized in
the said act to pay this rtfund with
out having an amount set aside for
t hl said purspose, sper-ific appropria
tion being necessary under the law."
This brings disappointment to per
sons in ('addo who were forced out of
business by the anti-near beer law.
They expected to have half of the li
cense money refunded b)y the state
right away as well as by the city.o
which already has refunded more than a
$1,000, being $25 on each license. All d
but four of the forty-six dealers have i
received the city's refund, and those
four will get same when they return xi
their license receipts. Ip
The receipts for state license will 0
be kept on record by ('hief Deputy E
Sheriff John McCullough., and when t'
the Legislature makes the required al- a
lowance, the refunds will be made.
The reason an appropriation was not - e
ordered by the lawmakers at their re- C
cent session is because the appropria- E
tion measure was prepared lrWfore the '
anti-near beer law was enacted, it is r
explained. At the next session doubt. o
less the Legislature will take action n
for relief for the forlmer near beer
men. - b

On account of the use of tested seed
modern methods of planting and cul- i
tivating and an extremely favorable t
season, the Calcasieu parish corn
crop promises an average yield of
thirty-five bushels to the acre, accord
ing to agricultural experts. This Is
above the acre yield of the corn belt a
state. The total crop at this rate P
would be worth $400,000, as compared a
with $10,000 for all four parishee flv*
years ago. The corn crop is noti
most equal In value to the cattle rais- P
ing industry. a

DEBLA IS BORDER (
NEWS EXAGGERATED
WOULD RID CAMPS OF NEWSPA
PER CORRESPONDENTS WHO
SEND OUT FALSE ACCOUNTS.
ban Antonio, Texas.-Gen. Funston
sent to the War Department at Wash
Ington a telegram announcing his in
tention to rid the various guardsmen
camps of newspaper correspondents
who send out false accounts of condi
tions in the camps.
He referred to such correspondents
as "pests" and said lie had endured
them as long as he purposed to.
An order has been sent to all dis
trict commanders along the border
" vt0"ng future' action against news
out . dispatches
as Untruthful.
iIn eai ostance the offender will be
tried by a special court of militia
officers from his state. If found guilty
he will be ordered from the camp.
"The great mass of the guardsmen
are stagding the hardships of camp
life well," said Gen. Funston, "and
have no cause for complaint. It is on
ly mollycoddles and sissies who kick.
These are the ones that tell tales to
Lj special correspondents."
'The general's telegram, which was
sent to the adjutant-general, said:
"I wish to call attefition of the War
Department to the carnival of lying
being indulged in by many of the cor
respondents who accompanied the
state troops to the border. I have
never seen or heard of anything that a
approaches it for shFer maliciousness
and shamelessness.
"While there are honorable excep
tions, many of these correspondents
are men of no judgment or balance
t and have had so little experience of
the world that they seem to have no
sense of balance or proportion. Ordi
nary inconveniences or deprivations
that to a man of real soldierly in
stincts are merely subjects for jokes
are magnified by them into the most
distressing distortures 1
"They persistently neglect to say
anything about the excellent and cred
itable things that they see, and if they
can see nothing to find fault with,
manufacture lies out of whole cloth.
The effect is to distress needlessly the
families and friends of the members
of the state organizations and to make
people of other nations think we are 8
a degenerated race of sissies and mol
lycoddles, incapable of being made in- t
to soldiers. I have endured these pests
as long as I propose to, and shall
hereafter bar offenders from camps
and prohibit them from accompanying
troops on the march."

CASEMENT GOES TO
HIS DEATH CALMLY
IRISH LEADER CONVICTED OF
CONSPIRING TO CAUSE ARMED
REVOLT IN IRELAND.
London.-Roger Casement, former
British knight and consul, was hanged
in Pentonville jail for high treason.
He was convicted of conspiring to
cause an armed revolt in Ireland and
with having sought German aid to
that end.
Two hours before the execution a
crowd of men, women and children
gathered before the prison gates.
r Twenty minutes before Casement
mounted the scaffold the great prison
bell commenced to toll. The sound
was greeted with cheers from the
e crowd, mingled with some groans. At
a 9 o'clock the crowd had swollen to
such proportions that it extended for
two blocks from the prison front. At
one minute after 9 a single stroke of
the big bell announced that the trap
had been sprung. It was the signal
for a mocking, jeering yell from the
crowd, which suddenly died away into
dead silence.
Casement met his death with calm
courage, according to eye-witnesses.
Early in the morning two priests of
the Roman Catholic Church adminis
tered the last rites in the cell of the
condemned man and shortly afterward
a little procession headed by the cler
gymen with Casement following, a
warden on either side, proceeded to
the execution shed, only five yards
away. The priests recited the litany
of the dying, Casement responding in
low tones:
"Lord have mercy on my soul."
According to one of those present
Casement's last words were 'I die for
my country."
As the party reached the shed where
the gallows was erected the special
executioner, a hair dressed named El
t lis, approached Casement and quickly
pinioned him. The two chaplains,
the under sheriff of London and the
Sunder sheriff of Middlesex then took
r up their positions in front of the scaf
fold. Casement mounted the gallows
firmly and commended his spirit to
God as he stepped on the trap. A
moment later the lever was pulled.
Immediately after the trap was
sprung the prison engineer and physi
cian descended into the pit where, af
ter the aplication of the usual tests,
Casement was pronounced dead at
nine minutes after 9. According to
a the custom in the case of prisoners
Z hanged for crimes similar to that of
Casement, his body will be buried in
quick lime in the prison yard, but pro
bably no decision as to the burial will
t be made until after the inquest.
Mexican Hero Honored.
1 Laredo, Tex.-Flags were at half
mast throughout the Mexican republic
in commemoration of Padre Miguel
Hidalgo, who was executed in 1811, a
- martyr to the cause of Mexican free
dom. Hidalgo declared a revolution
on September 16, 1810, to free Mexl
co from the yoke of Spain, but was
captured and executed a year later.

Vessels Arouse Suspicion.
WVashington.-Activities of persons
suspected of being spies employed by
foreign governments to acquire infor
mation regarding the nature and ex
tent of the defenses of the Panama
('anal decided the administration to
request Congress to supplement the
existing laws against the improper ac
quisition of knowledge of military and
naval plans and fortifications.
Representatives of the Department
of Justice and the War and Navy De
partments have been in conference on
the subject, and it is explained that
they will agree upon some very dras
F tic legislation to be submitted to Con
gress. It is possible that the scope
of the conference may be extended
beyond the original idea of a mere
protection of the secrets of American
coast defenses to cover generally such
r attempts as have been common since
d the beginning of the present war to
1" destroy powder and munition plants,
o upon which the United States govern
d ment must rely in time of trouble.
0 Several of the military powers of
the world are believed to have under
a taken to obtain information as to the
n character of the defenses of the Pan
S. ama Canal. The latest incident to
it excite suspicion is the operations o4
n a little Japanese power vessel, which
id sought to obtain a permit for pearl
ie fishing in the waters of Panama and
1t vicinity. The canal authorities have
to been warned that this craft appeared
)r to have been making surveys, and
Lt that these were not confined to the
Df rater, but extended to the isthmus
P proper.
ii While these operations may have
1e been perfectly innocent in intent, and
;o only such soundings were made and
bearings taken as might be incident
n to the pursuit of pearl fisheries, the
5* canal zone authorities have regarded
f the matter as of sufficient importance
l 'o warrant investigation and report
e to Washington. Meanwhile licenses
d have been withheld until some gen
r- eral line of policy can be formulated
a to govern all such cases.
