Not See Service on Mexican
Border.
Captain J. O. Parker of Co. H and
Major M. J. Phillips, Inspector of small
arms practice of tbe First Brigade of

signed after having spent many weary
weeks at Grayling with no prospect of
seeing or being needed for service In
Mexico or on the border, and Major
Phillips being discharged as the gov

inspector of small arms practice.
Dr. Parker was prepared to continne
his service if needed or if there was
any liklihood of real trouble in tne near
future, but he realized as do most other
citizens of tbe country that the war
with Mexico was a fake and fizzle from
the start and did not want to lose his
practice hanging around at camp while
the political ends of he game were
being worked out. He has been a good
officer and the community is indebted
to him in many ways in keeping the
company together and in good condition.

FORDNEY SEES SOUTH
BEHIND TARIFF SHIFTS
SURE MANY DEMOCRATS WILL
BACK BILL TO SAFE
GUARD PROPERTY.
If Next House is Republican New Law
Will be Ready July 4, 1917.
From the Washington Bureau
of The Detroit Free Press,
404 Metropolitan bank Bldg.
Washington, Ang. 4. (I) The great
est problem now before the United
States is safeguarding tbe prosperity of
the nation against the period immedi
ately following the close of the Euro
pean war.
(2) In the English house of commons
Premier Asquith has frankly acknowl
edged the dangers of free trade follow
ing the war and has announced that
Great Britain's policy is to be one of
"taking care of the British." This is a
frank adoption of the American protec
tive system inaugurated and carried out
by Republican congresses in years past.
(3) Tbe present administration has
failed utterly to take into account the
inevitable conditions which will follow
the war's end They bravely proclaim,
that the United States is enjoying ex:
traordinary prosperity and they credit
it to the Democratic tariff law.
(4) But the cold-blooded fact is thla
country is importing more goods than
It ever did before, exeludfag war sup
plies, Is experiencing a falling off in
exports.
(5) In a computation recently made
by Chairman Fitzgerald of the appro
priation committee of the bouse of rep
resentatives, it is shown that .the gov
ernment's expenses ifor the next year
will be approximately $1,857,000,000,
although the federal income, as things
now stand, will be only 11,100,000,000.
To prevent a deficit additional revenue
must be raised to the extent of three
quarters of a billion dollars'.
PROSPERITY NOT SAFEGUARDED.
(0) In the face of all this no leglsla-'
tion has been carried out to preserve
the United States in a state of prosper
ity although there loomsj close ahead",
the time when the world powers will
turn from 'their military fight for life
to au even fiercer commercial fight fcr
life.
(7) Indications are that the present
administration will be turned out at the
November election, that a Republican
president will be elected, a Republican
house of representatives established,
and perhaps a Republican senate. With
the house Republican, Congressman
Joseph W. Fordney, of Saginaw, Mich.,
will become chairman of the ways and
means committee invested with the
duty of originating legislation having
to do with the situation.
(8) Therefore, Mr. Fordnsy's views
become of paramount importance and
The Free Press has asked him to out
line what legislation will be presented
at the next congress to preserve United
States prosperity, guard against foreign
commercial invasion, safeguard Ameri
can industry, insure continuity of the
prosperous activities of capital and
labor and provide adequate federal
revenue for all forms of preparedness
without haying to impose galling inter
nal taxes on the people of the country.
Mr. Fordney's reply shows there will
on automobiles, or on gasoline, or cn
any other form of American activity;
no occasion for penalizing American
success nor for compelling any national
industry to shoulder tbe burden of
making up a federal deficit.
Five lines of action are indicated by
Mr. Fordney, all of which may be
embodied in one bill to be introduced
at a special session of congress imme
diately after the fourth of March next.
The five lines are:
(1) Repeal the existing tariff law
which has resulted in unprecedented
increase of imports though entailing a
tremendous falling of in revenue (70
per cent of Imports now comu in free of
duty.)
(2) Repeal of obnoxious stamp tax
imposed under guise of "war revenue,"
to make up for decrease in customs.
(3) Creation of a tariff commission,
whose duty it shall be to learn the
difference between cost of production
(raw materials and labor) of competi
tive goods in this country and abroad.
(4) Enactment of an anti-dumping
law to prevent foreign goods being
dumped in this country at lower prices
than they bring at home.
(5) Enactment of a tariff law which
will lay on competitive goodaa duty
equal to the difference in cost (raw
material and labor) of production -at
home and abroad.

The Free Press Inquired whether it
