OF R. R. TROUBLE
Dispute Deadlocked; Brother

Want Arbitration
LOOK TO PRESIDENT
Board Will Ask Wilson to In
tervene; Delay in Negotia
tions Asked
By Associated Press
New York, Aug. 11. After de
liberating the greater part of the night
Commissioners William A. Chambers,
Martin A. Knapp and G. W. Hanger,
of the United States Board of Me
diation and Conciliation, were to-day
no nearer a solution of the deadlock
in the dispute between the four rail
road brotherhoods of the country and
their employers than they were yester
day. The efforts of the mediators to
avert a nation-wide strike were vir
tually at a halt, due to the fact. It was
reported, that the railroads refuse to
grant any concsrsion other than arbi
tration, while the men persist In their
tlrm stand for the unequivocal grant
ing of their demands for an eight-hour
day and time ami a half overtime.
Look to President
A formal request for a twenty-four
hour delay in the negotiations was
made by the Federal board to the
union men to-day when they as
sembled to receive the mediators and
it was reported that the board, unless
there was an unexpected change In the
situation in that time, was prepared to
suggest to President Wilson that he
intervene.
Mr. Hanger, who asked for the de
lay, took pains to point out, however,
that no particular significance should
Vie attached to the sudden change in
their plans.
"It must be remembered," he said,
"that the question at issue involves
hundreds of railroads p.nd thousands
of men and th 3 mediators cannot ar
rive at a judicious conclusion as to the
merits in the case until they have thor
oughly assimilated the situation.
• Like Dynamite
Mr. Hanger added that the board
expected to continue its deliberations
to-day and might reach a decision by
evening as to tbe time of the next
meeting with one or the other side in
the dispute.
''We do not intend," said W. S.
Stone, chief of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, "to wait very
long on the mediators. The tempera
ment of the men is such that they
would not have waited a minute if we
had not persuaded them to give the
mediators a chance. Personally, I do
not care to carry the strike vote around
in my pocket for any extended period.
It is like a stick of dynamite."
Since its organization in 1913,
through an act of Congress, and up to
September 20, 1915, the board has sat
in forty-seven controversies between
railroads and their employes. In every
instance the" board has succeeded in
securing an ultimate adjustment of
the differences, thirty-nine cases hav
ing been setled by mediation alone and
eight, by arbitration.
One report current to-day was that
the railroad managers were ready to
propose a different form of arbitration
than that provided for under the
New-lands act which the brotherhoods
object to. This was that instead of
six arbitrators —two appointed by
each side and four or six neutral,
making a total membership of twelve
or fourteen. This would make it pos
sible also for each of the four brother
hoods to have an arbitrator on the
board.

Rescue Parties Carry
Relief to Thousands Made
Homeless by Cloudburst
By Associated Press
Huntington, W. V., Aug. 11.—Res
cue parties proceeded far into the i
mountain districts to-day carrying re- |
lief to thousands of homeless people i
in Cabin creek valley which was j
swept by a flood Wednesday, causing |
a loss of more than sixty lives and i
property damage reaching into the |
millions. Progress was slow as many
bridges have been washed out and the
roads are blocked by slides.
Score sof men have begun cleaning
up the debrie to prevent an epidemic
and to open the roads through the
valley so that supplies can be trans
ported to stricken towns.
J. W. Hartless, of this city, who was
at Eskdale Wednesday morning when
the cloudburst swept Cabin creek val
ley, is the first eye witness to reach
Huntington from the flooded district.
According to his story at 8:30 o'clock
in the morning Cabin creek started
rising at the rate of eight feet an
hour and continued until the creek
reached from mountain to mountain.
Houses floated down stream at the
rate of one a minute. He watched al
most all of Eskdale swept away.
Whole families rushed for the hillside,
but some never reached safety. One
could hear women praying on all
sides. Scores are missing and are be
lieved to be dead.
j Another battalion of the Second
; West Virginia infantry, was to-day or
dered from Camp Kanawha to the
i Cabin creek country to help the bat
'talion sent yesterday in relief work.
! Thirty-five identified bodies have
been recovered in the valley and the
; search is being pushed in the upper
i reaches where is wds believed for a
I time there had been no loss of life.
Food and clothing is being hurried
j from supply bases established by the
i military. Volunteers from Charleston
I and other cities are aiding in the
I work.
Flood Damage in Southern
Floods Is $4,500,000
By Associated Press
Charleston. S. C.. Aug. 11.—Flood
damage to railroads, bridges, roads,
crops and other property throughout
the Santee and Pee Dee river systems,
has been conservatively estimated at
$4,500,000 by Richard H. Sullivan,
section director of the Weather
Bureau at Columbia.
Mr. Sullivan, who issued a lengthy
report of the floods which early in July
extended through five States said the
total property damage in South Caro
lina alone amounted to $2,000,000.
Movable property valued at $400,-
000 was saved through Weather
Bureau warnings. The floods in South
Carolina affected 350,000 acres of
crops, the total damage to which prob-:
ably never will be known.
Failure of Publishers to
Send Answers Delaying
News Print Paper Probe
By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. 11.—The Federal
Trade Commission to-day announced
that its investigation into the price of
news print paper is being delayed to
some extent by failure of newspaper
publishers to send in answers to the
commission's questions as promptly as
it expected.
"Reports have been received," said
the commission in a statement, "to
the effect that some publishers are
hesitating to answer the commission's
inquiries fearing that their complaints
will reach the paper manufacturers
and they will have their supplies cut
off. The commission has assured all
such publishers that the communica
tions' would be treated as confidential
when requested and therefore they
need not have the least hesitation in
furnishing the commission with all
the information in their possession."
A large force of agents is now in
vestigating the records of news print
manufacturers, jobbers and others and
Information collected is being com
piled in Washington as fast as it is re
ceived."

Turkey Refuses Permission

Condition of Syrians
By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. 11. —Turkey has
refused to grant the request of the
United States that a neutral committee
be permitted to undertake relief work

Christians are reported to be starving.
Charge Miller, of Constantinople, in
a cablegram received at the State De- 1

told the decision was final he had not
dropped the subject but would con
tinue to press for favorable action.
On July 5 the department instructed
Charge Miller to call attention to the
fact that there had been no action
in this matter and to say to the Turk
ish Foreign Office that continued fail
ure to heed the request would put se
vere strain on the relations between

By Associated Press
New York, Aug. 11.—Wireless ob
servers at shore stations near New-
York were puzzled early to-day by
signals received from an unidentified
vessel apparently somwhere off Sandy

fact that the stranger refused to dis
close the identity of the vessel led
some of the wireless operators to be

Contributions of clothing, food and

those who have clothing for children,
from babies up to fourteen years, are

"We have been making daily in

tions In the homes of some of the men
at the front are pitiable in the ex

a gallant eftort to get along without

A Derry street woman, herself in

of the Division, asking aid for her
daughter and little children, who have
been forced from their home by in
ability to pay rent, while a physician's

soldier is not sufficient even to keep
them in food, "it seems hard," she
writes, "that they had to give up all
their furniture ior which they had
paid almost the full amount due, and
were getting along so nicely."
In another case ejectment proceed

not cared for.
"We simply must have some money
