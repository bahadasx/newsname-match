Although M. Kawakatsu of the Su

Ing by inability to secure a territorial

article 7 of : the. treaty with Japan

in this country he cannot exercise
them. The territorial treasurer says
that he can open his bank and obtain

yocTinform me that you read In the

per, that, a Japanese banking corpor
ation found it impossible to establish
its branch in thiscity under existing
laws of the territory.
To a certain extent this is' correct,
as; the only way. they could do busi
ness here is either as an individual, a
copartnership, or 1 as a domestic cor
poratian. Sect it n 5379, Revised Laws
of Hawaii, reads in - part as follows ;
"Provided, f ui ther, that nothing
herein contained shall be construed tt
give any such corporation or company
any of the special "iowers conferred "
by law Upon railroad or banking cor-roratlo-is
constituted Under the laws
of this territory." ? ; , I
The law refers not only' to corpora
tions of foreign countries but to cor- !
poratlons established under the laws
of any state of the United States.
I have talked over the matter with
; the attorney-general, who advises me,
that according to our law no iorein
corporation can do -fa' banking busi
ness in the territory The use of the
word "foreign is simply to designate
that the corporation' is one organized
outside of . the territory of Hawaii. 1
As this law has never been taken
to the supreme Court for interpreta
tion, it i8 suggested that a friendly
case be prepared and. brought before
that body so that we ma.y have an au
thoritative decision covering ' the
matter. .

Denver. Colo., Petrified remains of
a great forest that once stood on the
present site of Denver have been dis
covered by workmen who are exio'at
ing for the new building on the
Scholtz corner at Sixteenth ami Curtis
stTets. The pieces of petrified trees
were dug up about twelve feet beloK,
the street level. They were in a per
fect state of preservation.
Science only can estimate how .long
ago this vanished forest- flourished
where Denver how stands. It was
many thousands. of years ago, at any
rate, and more likely hundreds of
thcusands-r even millions. A com
plete change in the cllmats of this
region and sweeping alterations, in the
surface conditions caused the once
mighty trees to perish and become
covered with the materials that turn
ed the ood to solid stone.

From Maui Japanese comes the
complaint that missing money orders
amount to'about $2000. At the Hono

formed today that a number of tire
complaints were not accompanied by
receipts,' bo that the investigators do
not know how much money ts thought
to be missing. Tracing the money or
ders has been trade difficult and the
absence of the postmaster has delayed
a first-hand Investigation at Pala.
Inspector, Flavin says that some of
the orders were Issued, at Pala many
monthsrago. One case Is said to go
back to July, 1915. Tracing the paper
through Washington as well as J apa
