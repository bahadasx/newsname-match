FORNFELT FIRE
BURNS 5 HOMES;
LOSS IS $20,000
Haze Starts In Defective
"lue of Hughes Home and
Spreads Fast.
SCORES OF MEN FORM
WATER BUCKET LINES
Water Supply Fails and Tank
Wagons Come to Rescue
None Injured.
Fire wiped out almost an entire
block of dwelling houses in Fornfelt
yesterday afternoon and resulted in
damage estimated at between $15,000
and ?20,000.
Five homes were burned to the
ground and their occupants last night
were taken into the homes of their
neighbors. The flames swept from
one house to another for nearly two
hours in spite of the valiant efforts of
approximately 500 men to stop the fire
with bucket brigades and bucket lines.
In the midst of the hand-to-hand en
counter with the flames, the water sup
ply weakened upon the men and they
were forced to virtually stand aside
and watch the fire burn itself out
against the walls of the sixth home
that it reached.
The blaze was started about 4:30
o'clock, it is believed in a defective
flue in the home of R. L. Hughes, who
occupies what is known as the Forn
felt Fuilding. The Hughes home is a
six-room frame, a block south of the
Cotton Belt railroad tracks.
The flames got a good headway be
fore the fight against them was start
ed, for the fire was not seen until it
was noticed by a group of railroad
men who were working nearby. They
sounded a fire alarm by means of the
engine whistle and ran to all parts
of the town arousing men to fight the
flames.
Men dropped their work in virtually
every section of the town to fight the
flamos. Fornfelt is without any or
ganized fire fighting department and
the men realized that the city was
endangered through any flames that
got from their control.
Bucket brigades were formed at
onre, but they were too late to keep
the fire from eating its way into the
home of William Miller, bartender for
James Gill, who lives in the house
owned by Mrs. Mable Ringo, just next
door to the Hughes place.
Men aided the members of the fam
ilies in carrying out and salvaging
household furnishings and as it be
came apparent that the flames were
not going to stop at the Miller home,
they entered other homes in the line
and carried out'the furnishings.
There are six members of the Hugh
es family, all of whom escaped with
out injury. Mr. Miller has a wife, a
son and daughter, who also escaped
uninjured.
The next home in the line was a ls
room house owned by Arthur Keller
ami occupied by Frank and family. Mr.
Farmer is an engineer on the Cotton
Belt. Another 10-room home next to
the Farmer place, that of W. McMut
lin, was destroyed and the house own
ed by J. H. Bryant and occupied by
Oscar Bays and family, a 6-room
structure, also was wiped out.
The flames were scorching the side
of the home of P. J. Devine when they
finally were controlled by the scores
of volunteer firemen. After the city
water supply had failed in the emer
gency, tank wagons were driven to the
scene of the fire, loaded and buckets
were filled from them.
The McMullin home was the only
one that is known to have been in
sured. In all the places that were
burned, there was time to save vir
tually al lthe household furnishings.
Simultaneous with the fire, a switch
ing crew on the Cotton Belt, nearby,
had a wreck when the car jumped the
track and rolled over on its side. Nona
was injured in the wreck.
I GIVES BLUE HERRON
TO CITY PARK ZOO
Frank Wofford Catches Bird on
Island Has a Neck a
Yard Long.
While hunting and fishing on Big
Island in the Mississippi River below
the Cape yesterday afternoon, Frank
W. Wofford captured a blue heron, a I
large bird of the same family as the j
crane.
Te took the bird to his home in
Haarig and after showing it to sev
eral friends made arrangements
through Charles Hitt and Mayor Kage
to turn it over to the Fairgrounds Park
Zoo.
TIi3 bird had been shot by some
huntsman when Mr. Wofford came up
on it. The bird endeavored to escape
but could not run fast enough to get
away from the agile Cape lad. It is
believed that the one wounded wing
which prevented the bird from navi
gating properly, will be healed and the
bird will make a valuable addition to
the collection at the park.
The heron stands about three feet
high, when in a normal meditative at
titude, and has a pair of legs that com
pare favorably with pipe-stems. The
bird'o face is attached to the end of a
neck about a yard in length.
The heron was toted out to the
Fairgrounds yesterday afternoon and
presented to Frank Prescott, the offi
cial keeper of the City Zoo.
The bird had been wounded in the
left wing, and to make its stay at the
Fairgrounds permanent, Trainer Pres-
cott clipped off the crippled wing at i
the first joint. He then escorted the
stork down to the lake and introduced
it to the two wild geese. The geese j
proceeded to duck Mr. Heron, Mr.
Prescott announced, but the stork j
threatened to shut off further ship
ments of babies to this city, if the
geese carried out their threats, and
they were forced to desist. ....
The City Zoo now consists of the
geese, the heron, an owl, several rab
bits and some doves. While white
washing a tree in the Fairgrounds re
cently, Prescott frightened a rabbit out
of the grass and overtook it. Bunny
was installed in the zoo.
BORGLUM STARTS STONE MT.
CONFEDERATE MEMORIAL
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 10. Work on the
Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial
which will cost $5,000,000 and be carv
ed out of the living rock of a great
eminence, began today. Gutzon Borg-
lum, the noted sculptor, is in charge.
It will take a large force of men about
eight years to complete the gigantic
task. Special machinery had to be de
vised for the work, which is said to be
the biggest undertaking of its kind
ever attempted.
The principal part of the memorial
will represent a Confederate army
wending its way around the mountain.
Infantry, cavalry,, artillery, wago.
trains and all other sections of an ar
my will be hewn out of the solid rock
and they will be so large that they
will appear life-size to passengers on
the railway a mile off. Heroic figures
of Lee, Jackson and other Confederate
leaders will be carved, and at the base
of the mountain a commodious hall, in
which the Daughters of the Confedera
cy will keep historical records and rel
ics, will be hewn out.
The first work today was the start
ing of scaffolding and suspensions to
be used by the workers and the setting
up of machinery.
The mountain is approximately eight
hundred feet high a solid rock of
granite and the sides are so steep it
will te necessary for the workers to
be swung ove rit. Mr. Borglum, when
actual work has begun, will direct the
work from a specially built cottage
half a mile from the scene of activity.
The cottage commands a view of the
whole mountainside and Mr. Borglum
directs the workers by means of sig
nals. YELLOW FEVER AT

DR. LEBER LOSES
STEIN TANK SUIT
Major Kage Decides Junk Dealer
Can Retrieve $50 Paid on
Bogus Deal.
In an opinion handed down last night
Mayor Kage, acting as justice of the
peace, ruled that Dr. J. S. Lehr wift
have to pay back $50 which he re
ceived from Peter Stein, a junk dealer
from St. Louis, in the transaction
known as the Stein-Lehr tank deal.
The case traces its history back to
January when Dr. Lehr first contract
ed to sell Mr. Stein the huge steel tank
that formerly stood upon Broadway,
west of the Himmelberger-Harrison
building. The tank was a part of the
former Stein & Lance mill.
The tank was the property of Lours
Stein of California, and Mrs. H. Lance
of North Middle street. Without sub
sequently being able to show that he
had obtained ownership of the tank,
Dr. Lehr proceeded to sell the steel
to the junk dealer, drawing up a writ
ten contrac t January 22, Ia.st, in whicc.
the terms were $550 for the tank on
the cars in the Cape.
Peter Stein, who is not related to
the Louis Stein, paid Dr. Lehr $5e
earnest money on the deal, and before
he got possession of the tank, another
independent deal was closed by Mrs.
Lance and Mr. Huters, agent for Louts
Stein, whereby the tank was sold to
the County Milling Company.
Peter Stein then found out that he j
had purchased something from a man
who did not own it. He sued for the
return of his earnest money.
Dr. Lehr, through his attorneys,
made the counter claim that Stein hac?
altered the contract verbally and hart
promised Dr. Lehr his profit in the
deal. They asked for a judgment of
$250 against Mr. Stein.
Mayor Kage threw this out and held
that Lehr owed Stein $50. The mayor
said Dr. Lehr and Stein could not
change their written contract with a
verbal agreement and he said that
anyway Lehr had no right to accept
earnest money on a sale unless he had
something to sell and was making
good that part of the bargain.
BARBERS UNITE TO RAISE
COST OF RESPECTABILITY
Coming, N. Y., Aug. 10. If you
would have your locks nicely trim
med it will cost you after August 14,
5 cents instead of the long-prevailing
price of 25 cents. Corning bar

decided, and unanimously. And to beat
the man who shaves himself, unless he
uses a safety, the barbers have lifted
the price to 50 cents for honing your
razor. This jump in price follows sim
ilar action taken by barber associa
tions in several other cities in upper
New York State.

HUGHES HANKERS
TO INVESTIGATE
ADMINISTRATION
Republican Nominee Says
He Would Like to Look
Into Records.
ASSERTS WILSON IS
PLAYING POLITICES
Declares President Uses Jobs to
Pay Debts toward
Heelers.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Fargo, N. D., Aug. 10. Charles E.
Hughes in a speech here tonight re
newed the charge that the Wils.m ad
ministration has used public office to
pay political debts. He repeated the
charge that President Wilson had ap
proved tiic methods of the members of
his cabinet in forcing competent offi
cials to resign in order to provide jobs
for Democratic ward heelers.
The Republican leader said he would
'ike to have the authority to investi
gate the Wilson administration for
about six months. His speech dealt
with the foreign policy of the Wasn
ing'o.'i administration, with the burden
of ills talk on Mexico. He i-hartr-ed
President Wi'.on with elevating one
bandit in order to retire another, and
declared that by entering and with
drawing from Mexico had humiliate
the nation among the nations of the
world.
lie asserted that the wishy-wihy
policy that this nation had assumed to
ward the Europe;; belligerents had
been largely responsible for the com
plications on this side ()f the At'antic.
Had the United States taken a stand
and maintained it. he asserted, the
country would not have been brought
to the verge of the war.
At Grand Forks, N. 1)., Mr. Hughes
told an audience of farmers that he
believed in a protective tariff that
won id protect them as w ell as the men
in the factories.
"I believe in protection without
abu v.'." he said. "1 think that is mis-
ible.
"Our opponents, who for generations
have told us it was contrary to tlie
Constitution of the United States to
have duties except for the purpose of
revenue, are now telling us that there
i. an economic revolution and that
perhaps we can have a duty on dye-stuff.-;
and a nonpartisan commission.
But 1 believe in trusting those wno
really accept the doctrine of protection
with its enforcement, and 1 beMeve in
protection for the farmers, just as I
believe in protection for the men in
the factories."
Hughes repeated his views on pre
paredness, saying that lie stood for
"reasonable" preparedness.
"Weakness breeds insults and in
sults breed war," he said. "I stand
for the protection of American rights.
Firm insistence on American rights
backed by reasonable preparedness
meaas peace and security."
Crisp weather, so cold that overcoats
were nece.-sary, greeted the nominee.
