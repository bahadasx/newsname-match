From Boise, Our Capitol City
No Town More Charmingly Beautiful In That Quiet, Set
tled Fashion That Spells Home
There are towns in Idaho, espec
ially in the north, with a wilder,
more romantic appeal than Boise,
but none more charmingly beautiful
in that quiet, settled fashion that
spells home. The arts of the real
estate booster and the restlessness
of tourist .travel do not mar the
staid loveliness of this town, which
has its own business and goes about
it, and its own considerable and
unswerving population of 25,000
souls,
Boise is a city of homes, long,
level streets, where walnut and
maple trees nearly meet overhead,
extend for miles, and everywhere
are homes — no weary stretches of
vacant lots, but everywhere green
lawns and shaded porches where
people sit and enjoy life in a priv
acy wrought by the trees, that
reminds one of life in the old Span
ish patios. .
But Boise is more than a city of
homes. It is the center of the life
of the state. Situated in southern
Idaho, and connected with the north
by a railroad service which rambles
through two other states by the
a
way, and by a wagon road over the '
mountains that daunts any driver
unless of an ox-team, it is yet
closely related to the north as its
j capitol city. Here are situated the
| State House with its legislative
chambers, Penitentiary, Roman
Catholic and Episcopal Cathedrals,
Soldiers' Home and state charitable
institutions, not to mention .such
definite contacts with the national
government as the U. S.
Office and Army Barracks. Boise
seems, on reflection, to be a city of
institutions, where the beautiful
Capitol dome, rising high above the
trees, * dominates the pulsing life
going on beneath. One pictures in
fancy a city of crowded streets
where hurrying legislators with
black books and top hats, soldiers
in khaki, an occasional chain-gang
in stripes and priests in shovel hats,
mingle with thronging citizens on
Assay ]
business intent, and make varied
and picturesque the ordinary life of
the city. Such, however, is not the
case. Our soldiers have gone to
the border, and the barracks — old
stone and wood buildings covered
with vines, and handsome modern
brick structures alike — stand sil
ent and empty around the deserted,
grass-grown parade grounds; no
chain-gang is apparent; no legis
j l^tive session has occurred for more
^ than a year, and during sessions
I top hats are rare. A vacation hu
! mor, moreover, seems to possess
the town : sl.irtwaisted men talk
politics over counters or office desks,
! women crochet on shady piazzas,
National pay-up week will occur
October 2 to 7. This will be a time
j w ^ en everyone is expected to make
a special effort to get square with
the world. .

Attention is called to an article
j n another column descriptive of
: our capital city. A considerable
degree of ignorance prevails among
untraveled northerners regarding
the south—largely on account of the
inadequate means of communication
between the northern and southern
sections. Under the circumstances,
such accounts as the Gazette is
[ printing seem desirable.
of
i
i
pretty girls in dainty dresses and
small boys in home-made auto
mobiles go up and down the pleas
ant streets, and these make up the
summer life of Boise as seen bv the
casual observer.
Boise is an old town, but it does
not look old. One Hays street is a
picturesque little log structure,
with beautiful kept grounds i a
round it, cherished and preserved
by the local chapter of D. A. R's
as the first house in Boise to shelter
a woman. This is old, as, indeed
are the houses in many streets, but j
almost everything is tended and
kept in repair by a prosperous com
munity. Boise is of the present
and the future, not of the past.
One criticism is made especially
in the summer, by visitors from
other progressive towns, and that
is with reference to the park
system. An answer may be made
that walking down any street of
Botee, with its spreading trees and
well kept lawns, is like walking in
a park. The fact remains, how
ever, that there is no beautiful, ex
tensive, well-kept out-of-door
' gathering place for the people of
Boise. One down-town square,
with seats, band-stand, drinking t
fountain and small play ground is
inadequate for that kind of thing.
The Natatorium Park is small and
crowded with concessions and pic
nic tables, to the detriment of
what natural beauty it might have.
The Julia Davis Park is a small but
beautiful improvement along the
river, with green lawn, young trees,
honey-suckles and roses growing
along the stone embankment, but
here the lack of shade and seats,
and the fumes from the gas tanks,
which a westerly breese brings, are
drawbacks. The Pierce Park is a
beautiful grove but too far from
the citv. Here, however, the hand
of man has interfered wisely in
placing such necessaries and adorn
ments only as ducks and swans on
the pond, boats on the tiny lake, a
picturesque swing foot-bridge over
the river, not too many tables,
seats, swings and an inconspicious
enough dance pavilion. By turn
ing one's back on these, it is pos
sible to feast the eyes on lovely
groves of slender-stemmed trees,
with brown hills and blue moun
tains in the distance and no re
minder of the works of man to in
w Rh
terfere with one's communion
nature.
Boise, in short, is such a
beautiful gem that it is hard to un
derstand how its people can remain
content until every line and facet
is polished and made perfect.

Good Yields Reported
Lapwai, Aug. 7.—Threshing was
commenced a few days ago on the
John Maynard place on the middle
fork of the Tom Beall creek and the
report received today from 75 acres
of barlev and 100 acres of wheat is
that the barley averaged 60 bushels,
while the wheat average is 40 bush
els to the acre.
The weather for the past few
weeks has been especially favorable
for maturing the grain, the heads
being well filled and the kernels
plump and heavy. Spring grain
seeded on summer fallow land used
last year for growing corn or beans
will retnrn about the same yield as
the fall sown crops.
The f a i r committee met Wednes
day and definitely fixed the dates
