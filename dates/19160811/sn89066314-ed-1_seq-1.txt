That the W'jmeii's party now in con
ference at Colorado Springs, will
not be successful in forcing the adop
tion of a federal amendment enfran
chising the women voters of the coun
try by way of Anti-1'arty method", and
that the claim of this party that t li-
control 1,000,00(1 votes of Western wo
men, is a vague possibility, was the
statement made today by .Mrs. Walter
McNabb .Miller, a member of the Xa
tional American Suffrage Association,
and who represents Missouri on this
party board.
In Mrs. Miller's opinion it is tln
height of folly for the new Woman's
party to attempt to secure suffrage
for the women of the country by a
bi'tcr aggression on the Democrats,
republican or any other party of pow
er for the reTson that no one party
of the country is aide to put tlirousu
an amendment -giving the ballot to
the women by their individual vote.
N Interested in Xevt Part.
"I am very much Interested in the
movements of the new Woman's party
and in the publicity that it is getting."
said Mrs. Miller this evening, "but 1
think it is laughable that they should
be so foolish as to attempt to force
tlie passage of the Susan 15. An
thony amendment upon any one party.
"The Woman's party is not composed
of the bulk of the suffragists of the
country, it must be remembered. It
is the outgrowth of the Congressional
I'nion. a new National organization
of eastern women that asked admis
sion to the National Suffrage Associa
tion but which was refused admission
on accout of their anti-party prieiples
The Congressianal I'nion from which
this party sprung was organized two
years ago en EngPsh militnit suffrage

suffrage. Such a palicy. while per
fectly logical, with a government like
England or Canada, has no place in a
government like the ITtjited Ptites
where any measure, to be successful,
has not only to have a two-thirds

a condition which has never obtained

think that there were such a thing at

to give tlie amendment a two-thirds
majority would assist the Democrats
in this way.
"The claim that the Woman's party
makes that it has control cf 4.000.000

Two weeks ago I returned from Chey

"A second resolution was passed de
ploring the action of the Kastern wo

France, when I heard a low rumble.
For a moment I strained my ears to
find out what it was. Then came a
terrific detonation. The whole city
shook. I was thrown off the stool
on to my back, nearly stunned. I could
hear panes of glass falling every
where. The house shook and for the
moment I thought the roof was cav
ing in; nearly all the pictures had
fallen off the wall.
The crash lasted for about ten sec
onds. Then there was a terrible roar
like the sound of thousands of great
guns. I dashed out on the fire es
cape, and God! I have never seen
and don't suppose I will ever sec a
sight like it again. Off in the direc
tion of lower New York, a sheet of
flame arose, it spread and grew
brighter. In a minute the entire city
was lit up by a bright red glare, it
was as light as day for a while, but
then great puffs of smoke, black as
jet. dotted the sky. It looked as if a
fleet of airships had fired the city.
Meanwhile all the windows in the
street had fallen, everybody was panic
stricken, the street was filled with
half dressed people, fire engines were
running about, the sounds of police
whistles blowing and police clubs
beating on the pavement, were
mingled with the calls of the people.
From the roof of our house, as far
as the eye could see, the street was
filled with people, all running pell
mcll shouting at the top of their
voices. To be trite I must say pande
monium reigned, and rumors rained.
Just to give you an idea: the Wool
worth Ruilding has fallen, a gas tank
around the corner, a German bom
bardment, a naval battle, the navy

WASHINGTON, Aug. 11. Declaring
that unless Congress acts, the price
of bread surely will advance beyond
the reach of the average consumer,
the National Association of the Master
Bakers today petitioned the House
and Senate to impose an embargo on
wheat.
At the same time it was announced

mediately said that it was the Stand
ard Oil tanks at Bayonne gone up in
smoke. He seemed to have control of
the situation because he assured the
people that the explosion could not
have been nearer than Jersey. That
satisfied some of the people but others
were sure that it was right near us.
Some religious Catholics living down
stairs were sure that the end of the
world had come and proceeded to say
their prayers.
Every few minutes we would hear
another dull explosion and the sky
would light up, but not brightly; now
it was blood red. At about 2:45 a. m.
a great pall of black smoke began
to rush toward us (so it seemed). Be
hind this you could still see the flames
playing fantastically.
At about three o'clock, I heard that
ominous rumble again, and shouted to
the people below to look out. I hung
on to a pole on the roof and waited.
Sure enough, another explosion shook
the air. On the roof the rush
of air was so strong that it tore the
clothes off the clothes lines. More
panes of glass fell, more people
screamed, and the joke of if was that
the fire engines were running about
lookitiR for something to do and no
one knew anything about the cause
of the trouble yet.
Well, to cut this rambling story
short, I was up until 5 a. m. and at
that time I could hear intermittent
shots. At six, I went down town and
got a paper. The people in the house
were in agonies of suspense until I
got home with it. When they found
that a few hundred tons of dynamite
and a couple of hundred car loads

Hamilton-llronn Plans to Increase
Output of Shoes.
"There will be no immediate change
in the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Fac

new superintendent this morning.
"We intend to enlarge in the future.
but at present we will try only to
increase the output with the present
equipment. I intend to run the fac
tory at top speed all the time, and
the present condition of the factory
looks very promising to me."
Mr. Braselton. formerly general
manager of the Barker-Brown Shoe
Company, at Huntington, Ind., is the
newly appointed superintendent of the
local branch of the Hamilton-Brown
Company, and succeeds Paul Hogan,
who resigned. He Is forty years old,
and was with the Barker-Brown Com
pany for 18 years. He received his
training in the business in Cincinnati
Ohio, determined to learn the shoe
making game from the foundation up.
The fact that the University is lo
cated in Columbia was one of the big
factors that brought Mr. Braselton to
Columbia. He will move his family
here as soon as arrangements can be
made.
Mr. Braselton is a member of the
Christian Church, the Knights of
Pythias lodge, and is a thirty-second
degree Mason, and a member of the
Mystic Shrine.

latter candidates are seeking re-election.
Two Members From This District.
The two members of the state com
mittee that are to be elected from
this district are chosen by the chair
men of the different county commit
tees within the district. Mr. Boggs
says that he would not be surprised
if the election meeting results in a
deadlock, since four of the counties
in the circuit have pledged their votes
to Doctor Gray and himself. Grant

of the vote being tied up. Mr. Boggs
says, however, that there will likely
be some shifting in the voting after
three or four ballots have been cast.
It is not certain just how the Demo
crats from Columbia will go to the
meeting. The trip had been planned by
automobile but if the convention dead
locks and throws the meeting into the
night the motorists could not return
here until the next day on account of
the fact that the ferry on the Mis
souri River does not run after night.
Mr. Boggs says that the trip will, for
this reason, probably be made by

STREET SWEEPER IS SEST BACK
Failed to fJire Satisfactory Senice
City Saves $150.
The new street sweeper, purchased
by the city council three weeks ago,
and subject to one month's trial, was
returned today after being used for
three weeks. The old sweeper, which
has been In use for over a year, has
been repaired and will do the work
until a better one Is found.
"The chief objection to the new
sweeper," said Mayor Battcrton this
morning, "is the fact that It takes
three horses to pull It, and three
horses are unhandy on a sweeper.
When the machine wa3 filled with
water, a load of 3,000 pounds was put
on the horses, and with the low
wheels, this was a hard pull on the
grades.
"The city will save $450 by the use
of the old one. as the price of the
new sweeper was $500 and It required
only $30 to bay a new brush and put
the old machine In good repair."
