AUTO ACCIDENT
ON THE VIADUCT
Backs Through Railing, Falling Nine
Feet to the Ground.
An accident that might have been
fatal occurred on the viaduct Mon
day evening when a Dodge car oc
cupier? by six persons backed down
through the railing, falling about nine
feet to the ground below. Fortunate
ly the occupants escaped with nothing
more than a few bruises.
Dr. F. W. Richardson of Malta own
ed the car and it was occupied by
himself, Jack Mullins, and four young
ladies who were stopping at the Shan
non Hotel. They were waiting for
No. 3 to come in and deciding to ride
around the city started over the via
duct. Just as the car reached the
top of the viaduct, the engine stalled,
the car started to back down the grade
and the emergency brake failed to op-;
erate.
When the car reached the lower por
tion of the grade, it swerved and be
fore anything could be done to pre
vent, it went over the side of the via
duct landing on the top and pinning
tho occupants underneath. Witnesses
of the accident came to their assist
ance and soon had the car right side
up and were surprised to find that
no one was seriously injured. m Dr.
Richardson received a cut upon the
right forearm, and a slight cut upon
the head, while the balance of the
party suffered nothing more than a
severe shaking up. The car was tak
en to a local garage for repairs.

Hail and rain in the vicinity of

many years. The total loss will
amount to several hundreds of dol

Following three days of intense hu

storm came up from the west, rain
falling in torrents and the hail being
' driven by a severe wihd that caused
! to cut down standing grain almost
as com Pl e tely as could have been done
w 'th a reaper. The storm traveled in
an almost easterly direction, varying
a trifle after passing over the city to
directly east. West of the city
few stands of grain struck by
the hail doing a great amount of dam-1

WONDER PHONE
IN LOCAL CAFE
Model Hakerv to Install Latest
Music Marvel.
FIRST ONE IN MONTANA
ton Will Place Latest Entertain
ment Wonder in Local Cafe.
Hubbert & Buffton, proprietors of
>f 0 del Bakery and Cafe are show
ing their thorough progressiveness
and that they are right up to the
minute in everything pertaining to
their business by installing a Won
der Phone for the entertainment of
their patrons. The Wonder Phone
I is a new invention by which music,
either vocal or instrumental may be
transmitted to any number of places
at one time or all at once.
The Wonder Phone will be installed
in the Model Bakery and Cafe within
the next few days. It has been or
dered and shipped and is expected to
arrive at any time. Mr. R. G. Shra
der of Seattle, Vice-President of the
Universal High Power Telephone Co.
of that city is in Glasgow and will
sary equipmen/ When completed
music can be had at the tables in the
booths or in the large dining room
by the patrons as they desire.
The method of distributing the ser
vice consists of carrying it to the
desired location on wires which are
connected with the Wonder Phone
transmitter. This can be connected
with a phonograph or attached to
piano or can be so arranged that
can be spoken or sung into and the
sound will be carried to any of the
distributing points. The Model Bak
ery and Cafe will have connections
made with all booths, where switches
will be placed at the tables so that
diners may turn on or off the music
at will. In the main dining room
there will be placed a large lighting
chandelier and to this will be attach
ed the distributing horn from which
music will be distributed. This will
be under control of a switch at the
cashier's desk.
This new invention has l^een in use
a little more than two years and
whorev- r installed has given most ex
cellent service. It was used a' T.i
conia in 1915 during the bit;- automo
bile races, by which all announcements
to 'he grand stand were, made with
better results than had formally been
derived through 'te use of rtunounccrs
with megaphones. It has been in
stalled in most of the better hotels
and cafes of the wpstern coast and all
who have used it declare that it has
been a means of not only increasing
business but has been a source of ad
ditional pleasure to the patrons.
It speaks well for the firm of Hub
bert & Buffton, and demonstrates that!
they are not overlooking anything
that will be additional service to their
patrons, in placing the Wonder Phone
in the Motlel Bakery and Cafe. They
are n f aggressive, live wire, hustl
ing kind of business men that make
city grow and Glasgow is fortunate In
having them here.
The Model Bakery and Cafe have
also installed a telephone service to
each booth as an additional conveni
ence to the patrons. Anyone desiring
to call up from the booth has only to
ask a waiter for the phone and
be in without

NEW POOL HALL OPENS
Sierts and Hall opened up their
new pocket billiard hall in the Ulrich
building last Saturday and the pat
ronage was most pleasing to them
from the moment the doors were op
ened. The fixtures of the place are
of the very latest design combining
convenience and sanitation with per
feet service. The tables are the lat
est design and are of the best ma
terial with a lighting system which
gives perfectly dear vision from ev
ery point. The boys are well known
and are assured of a very fine busi
ness.
HAIL AT OPHEIM
A young hail storm hit Opheim and
vicinity yesterday morning and for a
time it looked like there would be
great damage to the crops. The
storm lasted only a few minutes, how
ever, and little damage was done.
The storm struck about a mile west
of Opheim and traveled east and
slightly north. It is probable that
the rain which accompanied the hail
was of more benefit to the crops than
the hail was detrimental.—Optimist.
NO SUNDAY TRAINS
A decision rendered by R. Lee Word
enjoins the Montana Railway Com
missioners from enforcing an order
made by them some months ago
whereby the Great Northern Railway
was instructed to furnish Sunday pass
enger service on all their lines.
The ruling of the court is to the
effect that the temporary injunction
obtained some time ago by the Great
Northern against the enforcement of
the order of the Commissioners will,
be continued until the case is finnally
determined.

AIRMAN SIGNED
BY FAIR BOARD
Loop the Loop Every Day at
the Fair Grounds.
Another thriller has been added to
the attractions to be furnished visit
ors at the Valley County Fair Sep
tember 7-8-9. The Directors have
completed arrangements with one of
the greatest airmen • in the United
States to appear on each day of the
fair, giving the very latest stunts in
up side down flights as well as loop
ing the loop, the spiral glide, banking
and the death drop.
The Board of Directors have been
planning all the year for this addi
tion to the fair and were only wait
ing to be sure the harvest season
would be far enough advanced to give
the farmers an opportunity to attend
the fair. As everything now points
to the harvest being well out of the
way by the time the fair dates arrive
the aeroplane contract has been sign
ed up and this great attraction is
now assured.
Timms, the aviator, who will ap
pear each day at the fair has made
a great reputation for himself in the
east during the past two years where
he has made successful flights in all
kinds of weather and under every ad
verse condition. He is a man who
makes a contract to positively fly or
else forfeit all claim to any fee. It
is a case of no flight, no pay and it
lose time and money. Under such a
contract the fair board feels safe in
stating that a real aeroplane flight
will be staged at the fair grounds
each day.

FRANCE MAY PAY MOTHERS
A bill is before the French cham
bers to establish a system of birth
bounties after January the first. The
state is to pay, under this proposed
scheme, $100 for each of the first
t.vo children, $200 for the third, $400
for the fourth and $200 for each one
thereafter. This bounty goes to the
mother. Fathers who support four
living children are entitled to a boun
ty of $400. The funds for these
bounties are to be obtained by taxing
those of either sex who for any rea
son are childless or > have only one
child.
