the charges of Charles K. Hughes that

mid Oliver, republicans, and other
senators on both sides continued the
political ib-bate for several hours.
.Senator Jones said democratic sen
ators, in first dcterinininv to postpone
udl'iii nil the child labor bill had set
t lie- stage for President Wilson to
make a s-nsatioiial visit to the capitol
ami "in a theatrical anneal to sena-

Senator Lewis, the democratic whip.
rclying to Mr. Hughes' recent refer
ence to President Wilson's "too proud
to fight" speech said "Judge Hughes
might lie saved from the exhibition of

lint aiiious ussailants of that which

to sometimes enter into explanations,
that he might demonstrate to Un

how, prompted by malevolence in I
some instances and by lack of Intel-1

assaults upon him."
The shipping bill finally was taken
up again just before adjournment,
when senator Jones began a speech
on it with the announcement, that he
would not be offended at senators
whose business call them from the

him at his word and left.

Lord Kohcrt Cecil, minister of war
