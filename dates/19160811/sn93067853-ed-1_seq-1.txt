duty if elected on August 29th. e
Sheriff's Race. i
J. Hay Fant, candidate for sheriff, ?
first intrnHin???H I nm honV ooVInn I
for another term. Could bring a rec- c
ord, but I have tried to do my duty. ^
If elected, three things I promise: I 4
wilP be sober, honest and ready to go
when called on. I promised this be- ^
fore and promise it again. It is for c
the people to say whether I have made fl
good. Thank you for your attention. *
Norris Leonard next introduced. I '
come asking the good people of my '
native county to give me a chance in *
life. I am talking to the people of the c
various walks in life. I was born in c
Jonesville. It is the height of my ^
ambition to lift myself.* I challenge ^
any and all to say that I ever drank '
any liquor. I will also be faithful and d
will go and handle the situation when *
get there. It is your duty to give c
. u: ? ?tk. ik.i j '
tmo unite tu me uue mat ucscrvcs it. *
I will live in the jail. I will keep ?
he rural police in the county. You 2
have to phone to the sheriff's office '
when you need protection. I am a
poor man. I ask the poor man to be d
my friend. There are numerous things c
that I might say. But you know my '
father was a follower of I^ee and v
Jackson. But I ask not your vote be- *
cause of my father's record as sol- c
dier, red shirt democrat and all else; d
but I ask for the office because I want a
a chance to make good. I place my- '
self in your hands. Norris Leonard I
will not be a bit surprised if Norri3 v
Leonard should be elected on the first v
ballot. I can tell from your faces that
Norris Leeonard will be your next 11
sheriff. 1
Jno. W. Sanders, candidate for sher- 0
iff, next introduced. I want to pay 8
my respects to the good ladies and
the good people of West Springs. I
lived in your community. I am here e
to announce myself for election to t
the sheriff's office again. My record t
for the eight years as sheriff was one t
of which I am not ashamed. I am n h
farmer. I expect if I had Mr. Fant h
and Mr. leeonard out in the field I c
believe I could lay them in the shade, h

f I am elected I will not give any

f my family. You know all our records.
Mr. Leonard will find it a hardr
job than he thinks to take up the |
ob of sheriff. If a great many of ,
ny friends had not urged me to run
would not be here today. I am the ,
ldest man in the race, but I am fully
ible to fill the office. On the 29th

will have this right arm pulled out
>y the roots before I would disgrace
ny family by not doing my duty. Come

vill live there.
Candidates for Clerk of Court.
Godshall, candidate for clerk of
:ourt. I come the second time asking
'or a public office. You elected me
joroner. I come now asking for eleciion
to the office of clerk of court. I
im as competent as any 6f my opponsnts
to All the office. It does not 1
-equire any great training, but it retires
common sense. There are four
:andidates. There is but one di'ffersnce
between us?each of us wants the 1
ob. Mr. Williams is your master.
Je makes a good one. Let him stay
here. Mr. Peake has had the office
i long time. Mr. Long is a good man. I
3ut I want you to remember me on
,he 29th of August. I will do my 1
luty. 1
Jas. G. Long, Jr., candidate for <
lerk of court, next introduced. I am .
isking your suffrage to the most im>ortant
office in the great scheme of :
iur government. You should inquire
vhether a man is honest and will do
lis duty. If the office is badly kept
ind should be destroyed it would cost
rou more than the loss of any and
ivery office. I was brought up in
he court house for my father was for
'ears sheriff. My record is before
rou. I have made good. I had charge
if the affairs of the county dispenin
A ?-?/I f nrlnvt 4- V* ?-? T Tn,

lispensary is the only one in the State
hac not a breath of scandal was foun*igainst
it. If elected I will prompty
record all papers. I will take pa>ers
one day and record them at once.
)f my opponents I can say: Mr.
3eake has made as good a clerk as
/ou have ever had. But he has had
he office long enough. And when yoa
?ave a man who is as good a master
is my friend Williams is, keep him
n that office. Godshall has made a
rood coroner. He should have sought
t again. We live in a democracy. I
im satisfied that if you give me the
>lace I think you will say at the end
>f my four years, "Jim Long, you
lave made as good a clerk as Union
;ounty ever had."
R. C. Williams was next introluced,
the last speaker for clerk of
ovirt. I saw the light just three and
i half miles from where I stand. I
im making no kick against the man
vho has held the office for 16 years,
"ive years ago I asked for election
o the office of master. I was your
-hoi'ce. I have made good in that
>ffice. I have never been reversed
>y a case that I have tried as master.
The clerk's office is merely a recordng
office. He should know how to conluct
the court. My experience as maser
has fitted me for the work in tne
ierk's office. If elected on 29th of 1
tugust i promise to nil the office well
ind to treat you courteously. On the
!9th of August I hope to receive a
early support from my people.
I. Frank Peake was next int?*oluced.
I am a candidate for clerk of
ourt. I appreciate your past suf- !
rage. I do not hope to get all ihe
'otes of West Springs. Mr. Williams ,
vill get some; he is a native of this
ommunity, as am I. The other candi- ,
lates will get some. I give all men
n equal and just treatment. Vote .
or the man of your choice. I hope
will be tflat choice; but, if not, I
vill step down and out and feel no ill
vill to any man.
At this point there was an inter- |
nission of one hour for dinner. At ]

For Superintendent of Education. ]
Thos. H. <Iore was the first spenk- !
r. He said: I am at a disadvan- i
age. There is too much stirring ovei <
here. A friend told me that I wrs 1
he best stump speaker Union ever i
ad. If so, that's all I have ever <
lad except a wife and a number of i
hildren. I have a good record. I i
lave done more for the schools than 1
He handled no money. He did not S(
steal. I don't believe he would if he
had the chance. In one year we have
17 school houses to my credit. There P1
is not a county in the State that can j*
beat my record. Every school house .
has been built and paid for. When 11
I came in, the term was short and uncertain;
and there was a deficit unpaid
claims. The school terms were tl
lengthened. There was $5,000 lying c?
in the bank, drawing no interest. I y<
got it turned over to the savings de- y<
partment. Why did not my friend do ft
this ? It was just a bit of headwork. v<
Will be glad to show you my books, hi
Iiast year I bought hundreds of feet ?]
of blackboard, and have contracted li
for 800 feet more. I taught school tc
for 19 years, and I know something dl
about schools. If we had the one- ui
room school all over the county in st
the name of common sense how would al
the 90% of our boys and girls get any ti
show? I stand on my record. I would tl
rather be defeated 5 to 1 than win bi
by unfair means. I claim to be a hi
clean man. la

I was defeated. Slander did it. I )t>e- si

at Buffalo for nine years. I taught
school in the city school of Union P
for three years. What little money
I've made in Union county I've in- s.'
vested in Union county dirt. Let our
records decide. It was not slander
that defeated my friend. The trouble
was in forgetting to charge off
his books the special taxes which -<^1

ie management of the tax fund is
e important question. It is not a
lestion of where a man was bom

st is: Our representatives must be

*acticed law in Union 14 years,
lere are some things that should be
odified. No pood roads bonds issue
ill be put throuph by me; the peoe
have already spoken on this. There
ill be no peddlers' bill, if I am to
ive what I shall stand for. The
ime law is too strict, and should be
odified. I believe a remedy should
j found for the endless appeal left a
lan in our courts. The court should
: required to give a certificate showit
mtfrit was in the appeal; that
I injustice had been done. The boll
eevil is rapidly approaching us. Misry
and ruin comes with it. I believe
)mc steps should be taken to meet
us pest that is coming. I will suport
any movement that will help us
> meet this monster. I believe in
iipporting, helping our old soldiers
berally. Also would help support our
ounger army. Yet, I saw another
rmy, our army of school children,
he rural schools should have the
une help that our city schools have,
he tax on fertilizer should be divided
etween Clemson and the rural
rhools. This would give equality of
pportunity. I think a student should
s helped, but not have all his course
adi for. The child should oe taught

gislature and I will strive to make
fe for our boys and girls a long,

PALMETTO TRO
OFF FOF
LANCASTER'S BODY f
FOUND SATURDAY
Was in Abandoned Shaft of Gold Min<?
Young Man liOst More Than Two 1
Weeks?Burial at Sulphur <
Springs Saturday Afternoon.
C
The body of Pettus Lancaster, son M
of Mr. and Mrs, M. W. Lancaster, of m
near West Springs, was found in an tr
abandoned shaft of a gold mine early m
Saturday morning. The young man tl
disappeared the evening of the storm
which swept over the county more T
than two weeks ago, and despite the C
concerted and persistent efforts of the G
entire neighborhood, no traee of him E
could be found except that his hat was R
found soon after the search was begun. d<
Many came to suspect foul play, but ni
the body, when found, did not bear G
out this belief. His money, watch and ni
other articles were found to be just le
as when he disappeared. The sup- or
position is that he left Glenn Springs es
late that afternoon, got within a mile
by the heavy downpour of rain and S<
of his parents' home, was overtaken O
the heavy wind storm and, becoming F
confused, lost his way. He must have Ji
taken the very opposite way home, Si
for it was some distance off the road, H
and in a thick wooded place that he dt
met the tragic end. The pit into si
which he fell was about thirty-five M
feet deep, had about ten feet of water a.
in it, and w?s almost a solid rock
basin. This shaft was examined by
the searching party, but was not
fumped dry as were several others. ar
t is supposed that the hooks failed to Ci
touch the body and that the darkness tr
prevented the finding of the body at ft
that time. ?
Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster have a wide c(
circle of friends who deeply sympa- n<
thize with them in the bereavement c(
that har overtaken them. They ex- tl
pressed deep aopi eciaiior. for the as- m
sistance rendered them by the people T
of the community, and said: "No one
can know how grateful we are for the to
unceasing kindness of our friends." ca
The body of the young man was
laid to rest in Sulphur Springs church y
graveyard late Saturday afternoon,
the*" burial being conducted by Rev.
Lewis M. Rice.
