Fred Merkle sizes up as one of the
most remarkable men In baseball.
Seven years or so ago he pulls a
"boner." It was a sllD of menial enhle
that would have been excused 99 times
out of 100. But that was the hundredth
time. Merkle's mlsnlnv cost th Npw
tork Giants the championship of the
national lengue and deprived them of
a split of the world series gold.
And from that day to this he has
oeen tne target for sarcasm. For two
or three years after that Incident his
every appearance on the ball field was
greeted with hoots. He was jeered at,
scoffed at and spoofed wherever he
went. He was ridiculed and his name
became a synonym for "bonehead."
The treatment accorded Merkle
would have broken the spirit of any
other man. It would have affected his
work to such an extent that not only
would he have skidded out of the ma
jors, but would have lnnded eventually
In the baseball scrap heap. It was the
sort of treatment that only a man with
Iron will a man filled with the do-or-dle
spirit could have submitted to
and lived through. And Merkle Is that
man.
Despite Jeers Becomes Star.
For seven years he has remained In
to same uniform that he "discredited-"
For seven years he has played a
brand of baseball that marks him rs
one of the most valuable cogs In the
Giant machine; one of the best first
basemen la the land. He has played
J'ways to hostile crowds; always be
fore people who were "gunning" for
Nm. He knew that every second he
was being watched ; that the slightest
flip would bring renewed hoots and
Hisses and Jeers.
It has been seven years and a bit
'onger since Merkle pulled his "boner"

However, the crowd already had

of the spectators and was deflected.
By this time Joe McGinnlty, the Giant
pitcher, sensed that something was
wrong. He rushed onto tho crowded

he started racing with It toward the
clubhouse in the hope of reaching Mer

George Cutshaw of thft Dnrlcprft
exuded a circuit clout against the
Phillies a week or so ago, which will
romp down through the vales of his
tory as the most remarkable since the
game was born.
The score was tied in the eleventh
when Cutshaw went to bat, facing
Mayer. The Phlllie pitcher heaved a
slow one at the Dodger second sacker.
Cutshaw started a swing, went half
way down and then "tumbled" to the
fact that the ball was a floater. Ho
"pulled" his stroke but iust na h
stopped, he noticed that the ball was
curving in, whereupon he made an-othe-

freak caught it on the end of the

But, ln the meantime. Cutshaw wns
performing antics that almost were as
stranee as those of the bnll. When
he rounded first, the Dodger second
baseman saw that the ball was headed
for the bottom of the fence a nor
mal two-base hit, If a player hustles.
And Cutshaw hustled. He turned
first under full head of steam and slid
Into second ln whirlwind fashion. He
lumped to his feet a second later and
began looking around for orders from
tne coaencs.
Wllbert Robinson, mannzer of tho
Dodgers was signaling something ln n
rranuc way. cutsnaw ngured that
Robinson wns ordering him to try for
third. Cutshaw started, but when he
got no sign from the other coacher,
who, by the way, was too busy watch
ing the climbing ball, he figured re
had misinterpreted Robinson's sig
nals. So Cutshaw whirled around,
ran back toward second nnd swent

Then Cutshaw iumned to hla fppt
amain and while he brushed his toes
he began looking for orders and also
for the ball.
Rut did "Robby" mean that Cutshaw
should stay at second or go to third?
Cutshaw pondered and at last decided
to try the advance. Cutshaw raced for
It. Halfwav alone on his lonrnnv tho
third bnse coacher, taking advantage
of the temporary lull In the cheering,
shouted :
"You hit i homer, George a homer:

Another one was: "An automobile
wheel is 30 inches in diameter. How
many revolutions will this wheel make
in traveling the 100 miles to Chicago?"
Strong came back with this auswer:
"104,476 revolutions."
A nail problem came next. He wns
told that 32 nails were to be driven.
One cent would be paid for the first,
2 cents for the second and double the
sum for each succeeding nnll. He was
asked how much he would be paid for
tho thirty-second nail. Aimnst in.

"1,267,200,000."

.Strong hesltuted for a few moments
and then gave the answer: "183.997.-

with this railroad problem: "There
are 750,000 miles of steam railroads
in the world. There are 352 rails to
every mile. To every pair of rails
there are 18 ties with 4 spikes per
tie. There are 5 bolts to every rail
and 2 steel plates per tie. How many
rails, ties, snlkes. etc." Within a few
moments Stong told his audience to
put down the following nnswer:
"There are 264,000,000 rails, 2,367,000,
000 ties, 528,000,000 flanges, 950,504,
000,000 spikes, 1,302,000,000 bolts and

pounds of steel ln the rails. At 50

2,244,000 cars or 44,880 trains of 50
cars per train."

He was asked to give the total of
all the numbers from one up to 9,600,
adding them together. His nnswer
was 46,084,800. The total of the num
bers from one up to 78,000 was 3,042,
939,000. Stong was asked how many bricks
would be required to lay a pavement
from New York to San Francisco,
3,578 miles, the pavement to be 60
feet wide and the blck 8 inches long
and 2 inches wide. He figured that
it would require Just 10,201,377,600
bricks.
