CHARGES AGAINST PROFESSOR
FAULKNER
Member Normal Faculty, Formerly
Acting President, Charged With
Activity in Rohalf of Cor-
ley P. McRnrment.
n An echo of the bamous McDarmont
murder trial was heard this week
when Jesse G. Watts of Wagoner,
father of the slain boy, preferred
charges against former Actlng-Prca-ldent
Faulkner of the local Normal
to the effect that Faulknor had been
unduly active In soliciting funds to
assist In tho defense of McDarmont.
State Suporintenednt Wilson hns set
August 24th as tho date when tho
Stato Board of Education will hoar
tho charges.
Watts was In Durunt for a fow
days several woeks ago, and at that
time expressed resentment at the
fact that McDarment's former asso
ciates Bhould havo subscribed to his
dofense. Whllo in intorviows In tho
public preos he ostensibly wanted
young McDarmont to havo a fair
trial, he Is nevertholoss bollevod to
havo desired that McDarmont bo pre
vented from securing able counsel if
possible, although this much is hear'
say, so far as tho News Is concerned.
Many school men and women, as J
well as several hundred othor citi
zens of Durant, subscribed liberally
to McDarment's dofense, a local bus
iness man having beon trustee of the
funds thus derived.
Tho charges ogainst Faulknor
come as a ourprlso locally, and as Mr.
Faulkner hnB not been here slnco
tholr filing, ho has not an yot beon
given an opportunity to speak for
lilmself.

ing. Electric Thresher The newest
thing in tho harvest fields of Kansas

farmers in Central Kansas. A doz
en farmers of tho Fnrmington neigh
borhood formed a co-operative asso

motor and set It on a low truck. This
was conlerted by a one-thousand foot
cable with tho nearest electric wire
along tho read. The motor turned

REFORM IN THE
CITY'S AFFAIRS
No Provision Mndo in Estimate for!
Publication of Ordinances. Ev
peeled that Snch Publication Will J
Ro Made by Those Most Interested.
One among tho several reforms in
stituted in the city's affairs Is tho
fact that no provision haB been made
in tho estimate for current expenses
for the publication of ordinances,
which horotoforo has taken qulto a
little sum of money each year. Under i
tho law an ordinance, oven though
It boar tho emergency clause, is not
offoctlvo untl it has been given pub
licity in at least ono Ibsuo of somoj
newspaper circulated In tho city
wheer tho ordinance Is pussed. Here
tofore, city councils havo been long
on tho passage of ordinances cover
ing ovory concolvnble sort of thing,
many of thom not worth to the city
what It coBt to havo them published.
The council now contemplates that
persons Interested In the passage of
any ordinance will thomselvcs defray
tho expenses of publicity.
This is only ono reform. Largo
sums have ben lopped off of many
of tho eBtlmutcd sums needed, and
otho rltems have been cut off entlro-i
ly. Tho salary of one class of city
omploycB has beon cut, and othor
embracing other departments are not
improbable. The whole business Is
th oresult of the determination of
tho council to reduce the tax lovy,
and tho effect of tho economios prac
ticed are already seen in a marked,
degree in a lower levy for current
city purposes this year.

GUY TAX LEVY
MUCH LOWER
Total Lovy $1.81 Per 81 OO Valuation
Ah Against SU.110 Last Year. Tho
(Jounty Levy Also Mndo Ry the
EycImo Hoard.
Tho county excise board in session
last wcok fixed Durant's total city
tax levy for the current year at $1.81
por $100 of assessed valuation, as
against a levy of '$2.30 last year,
thereby saving to the taxpayers 49c
on each one hundred dollars of as-
;so8servaluatlon. Tho reduction has
been made possible only by the prac
tice of tho mo3t rigid and exacting
economy in municipal matters, and
after denying to soma of the city de
partment heads things that wore al
most necessary.
Tho county levy for all purposos
is 60c por $100 valuation, which 1b
clightly higher than last year. The
reason for tho increase Is very easily
scon, i Ono reason is a reduction of
halfa million dollars In tho assessed
valuation of the county, and another
reason is tho levy of 1.4 .mills for
county road purposes, as against only
one'-fourth of a mill for tho same pur
pone last year.
Aa to valuations of tho county,
personal property shows a decrease
of $750,000 from last year, while
reah estate shows an Increase of
$250,000, in round numbers. The
increase in real estate is due, for the
most part, to tho increased number
of Indian allotments sold, thus mak
ing them taxable.

MURRAY CONTESTS ELECTION
Congressman W. H. Murray has
filed with the county election boards
of six counties in the Fourth Con
gressional District, formal demand
for a recount of the ballots cast for
Democratic nomination for Congress
in the recent primary election whero
tho returns show T. D. McKeown of
Ada to luive been nominated with a
plurality of 259 votes. The date for
recount has beon set for August 9th
In Pontotoc County. The other coun
ties will be counted at early dates.
The counties contested are Pontotoc,
Seminole, Hughes, Okfuskee, Creek,
and Coal.
Mr. Murray has given formal no
tice to the State election board of his
demand for recount and forbade is
suance of a certificate of election to
McKeown. The board, In tho ab
sence of logal process from a court,
will probably issue tho certificate
on the faco of the returns.
In the course of a statement re
garding the matter, Mr. Murray said.
"I do not wish to bo understood as
charging tho election officers gener
ally with bolng unfair. Tho work
was done by the counters, and the
other election officers wero either
obliged to accept their statements or
recount tho ballots.
"In Pontotoc county. Judge Mc
Koown's home county, my informa
tion is that 125 votes actually cast
for Smith wore counted for Mc
Keown, and more than 200 votes cast
for me wore also counted for him,
and that many other votes wor
markod mutilated which properly
should have been counted for me.
In the Francis box alone sixteen bal
lots of this diameter wore thrown
out aololy because thoy woro marked
with a pencil, instead of a stencil.
This, thoy had no right to do, for the
courts havo rightly hold that a bal
lot cast by a legal voter whoso Inten
tions can fairly be ascertained should
bo counted, whether ho marks it
with a stencil or pencil.
"In Okfuskee County one ontlro
box was not counted for tho alleged
reason that the returns had not beon
cortlfled to, whon it was the duty of
the coutny elootion board to havo
Bent for the election officers to make
tho returns. In this samo box two
yoars ago tho returns woro nndo giv
ing one of my opponents forty-eight
votes and mo two yoes, whon the
ballots cast shower forty-eight for
me and two for him,"
