SHEED COTTAGE BURNED
Mysterious Fire Baffles Fighters.
Oldest House in Ashes.
Wind Favorable.
Edgar Tisdale and an assistant
had completed packing house
hold goods but a short time for
storing until they could be mov
ed to whatever point desired and
Tisdale then went for a rig in the
barn at the rear of the premises
in which he and Judge J. E.
Montgomery went to the Chari
ton river for fish. Jimmy Tay
lor assisted- in getting the rig
ready and rode with Tisdale to
the front of the premises where
he got out and Tisdale proceeded
to the home of Judge Montgom
ery and they at once left on
their fishing jaunt.
Jimmy Taylor discovered the
rear of the cottage to be burning
perhaps before Tisdale was five
blocks distant, and sounded an
alarm, at once. Those who were
within a few feet of the build
ing saw that the entire upper
part of the kitchen was blazing
and so rapidly did the fire gain
headway that but few articles
were rescued from the front
rooms. The wind was from the
southwest and carried the flames
and embers directly across the
street to the W. D. Vaughan
cottages and the Methodist
church, and the saving of these
buildings was the best kind of
work. Had the wind been from
any other direction especially
from the north, - there is no
guessing the destruction which
would have followed.
The Mrs. A. L. Sneed cottage
was partly of the oldest house in
town, having been built by01d
Master Redding some time dur
ing the 40s and formerly stood
on the corner now occupied by
the Vaughan hardware store.
Chief Tisdale and his mother and
sister had occupied the cottage
until the death of his mother
and the departure of his sister
for St Louip, and the household
goods were packed and ready for
removal.
James W. Bently
One of the land marks of the
county died at his home in Dal
ton Mo. Jul y 25 and was interred
in the cemetery at that city,
July 27.

Mary E. Blankenship, Minnie
Sparks. A son, Charles born
April 4 1871 died, and the wife
who was the daughter of Joel
and Polly Bowling, died March 9
1910. The clergyman officiating
at the marriage of James Bently
was Rev. Heny S. Covil, known
to many of the older citizens.
James Bently was a confederate
veteran, and took much interest
in the Sterling Price Post of
this city and was always jn hand
when any demonstration was in
progress, He was a handy man
at any thing he . undertook, con
ducting several sawmills during
his life after he quit farmwork
and during his later years devot
" ed his attention more particular
ly to the manufacture 'and sale
of a salve, the formular which
he got from an Indian years ago.
' Had his health and means per
mitted he would have realized a
compentence from the article of
medicine.
. There was a large number of
the well known old citizins and
friends of the family present to
pay their last respects to the man
who had seen so much of lifes
variable ways.

Well another Primary Elec
tion has come and gone. Some
good men won, some lost now
there is but, one thing left tor
us to do and that is to close up
our ranks and stand firm for the
right by the .election of Wood
row Wilson and Marshall who
have already done so much for
u. No general ever took a
victory over an enemy with bro
ken ranks or with a stragling
army. But we must close the
ranks and present a solid front
if we expect to win a victory
over all opposing foes. Respect
fully a true , Jeffersonian Demo
crat' R. P. Cterkson.
Please Notice the Blue
X Markjon Your
Paper. It Means
You owe us for
we would like very much to have
without delay. W on 'tyou favor us?
Toured In Ford Car
Mr. and Mrs. Theo. Wood re
turned the latter part of last
week from the west where they
went for a general inspection of
the country between here and,
Oregon. The objective territory
was Wyoming and from what
they saw of that section, they
were well pleased. They say
that as good crops as they ever
saw was growning in Nebraska
and Wyoming in parts, the crop
of all kinds presented a fine ap
pearance, but neither of them
fancied what they observed in
Kansas.
Mr. and Mrs. Wood returned
via Cheyenne and Colorado, mak
ing the journey of se?ersl thous
and miles in their Ford touring
car which was thot to be nearly
worn out when they left but
which, after traversing sand des
serts, rocky causeways, Up hill
and down mountainous inclines,
is performing about as well as
ever. No trouble, tire or other
kind, was experienced worth
noting, and the roads every
where are reported to be good.
Mr. and Mrs. Wood camped
out a good portion of the time
but got their meals at hotelries
and both returned much pleased
with the trip of several weeks.
Whether they locate in Wyoming
or not has not been determined
by them.
Republican County Committee
The Republican County Cen
tral Committee met here Tues
day and reorganized by electing
F. Bion McCurry chairman, Otto
Benecke secretary and Orbrey
Sterner treasurer. There was a
spirited contest over the chair
manship, the final vote being one
majority for McCurry over El
mer Lewis.
There were 13 of the 16 town
ship committeemen represented.
The only resolution audibly ex
pressed was one favoring Will
Sweeney of Salisbury for a place
on the Republican State commit
tee. '
Proxies in this meeting cut a
big figure as they always do, but
harmony is the watchword of
the g. o. p. adherents this year,
especially in connection with
anything which might sprout
antlers. v
Westville Progressive
The bond election held at
Westville carried two to one in
favor of issuing $2000 bonds to
build a new school This amount
with what can be realized from
the old building will give the
district sufficient funds to build
a modern two room, house and
equip it properly. The Westville
School District will see a favora
ble change from the very start
and will keep pace with other
first class country schools from
now on, an impossibility with a
ramshakle house and ' insuffi
cient equipment. '
Mrs. Anna Lbngwell and Mrs.
Lillian Westlake have purchased
the Tisdale-Hurt millinery stock
and opened up for business in
that line at the old stand. These
young women of splendid crea
tive taste in matters of dress
should succeed admirably, "and
we believe will merit a fair share
of the trade. ,

Williams-Talbert
August 9 th, at the home of
of Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Williams
Mr. Thomas J. Talbert of Colum
bia was united in Wedlock to
Miss Mary E. Williams, a daugh
ter of John P. Williams, former
residtnt of this county, but now

Rev. W, L. Meyers performing

mony at which few others than
relatives were present and con
gratulations, a wedding dinner
was served and the happy
couple departed for southern Mo.
to spend a portion of the wedding

short time on Lake Taneycomo.

and graceful young woman, her
husband is to be highiy congrat
ulated on winning her, and Mrs.
Talbert congratulated on secur
ing for her life partner a young
man of exceptional attainments.
We failed to secure informa
tion concerning the event last
week In time for publication.
Hundredth Anniversary
Howard County will hold a
"Home Coming" celebration of
her hundredth anniversary Aug-16-17.
Her anniversary was on
Aug. 13 1916, but the weather
during winter time was not to be
considered for such an occasion
as the sons and daughters of the
county wished to make this one,
hence the date was fixed as
above.
When it is considered that at
the organization of the county
Jan. 13 1816 the territory com
prised included Boone, Cole, Hen
ry, Johnson, north parts of Mil
ler, Cedar, and St. Claire, Mor
gan, Lafayette, Pettis, Cooper,
Moniteau, Saline, Clay, Clinton,
DeKalb, Putman, Sullivan,
Linn, Ray, Caldwell, Carroll,
Livingston, Mercer, Gentry,
Worth, Harrison, Daviess, Shel
by, Monroe, Adair, Chariton,
Randolph, Macon, and Audrain,
counties in in Missouri and Union
Ridgold, Clarke, Decatur and
Wayne and parts of Taylor
Adams, Lucus, Monroe, and Ap
panoose counties in Iowa, it will
be seen that old Howard county
was atone time larger than many
of the states of the Union, and
if patriots from each of the coun
ties formerly comprising Howard
are present in any number, the
Home Coming will be an event
of pronortions. The program
for the occasion is varied and all
who can should attend both or at
least one day.
Tom Oldham of Mud Creek
but more recently of Larmar,
Colo, writes and says that he
wishes the Courier was twice its
present size and filled according
ly, v Tom tries to make it appear
that it is not worth $1.50 a year
but he wont do without it if
we have to raises to two plunks
for. 12 months.
Tom is thinking of coming to
eastern Kansas in the near fu
ture and if so he .will be close
enough to run in occassionlly as
he has a flivver.
