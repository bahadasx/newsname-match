The Farmers' Paper
VOLUME XII
A very short while elapsed'
before the fire whistle sent out
ils call of warning and almost im
mediately after that the fire boys
were on hand and had several
streams of water playing on the
Schweitzer building, which at
that time had every appearance
of a seething furnace. Several
times the Hoffman store, adjoin
ing to the north, caught and only
the prompt and efficient work of
Ihe department saved it from be
ing almost the total loss the Em
porium is. Hoffman Bros, with
the assistance of willing witness
es packed up the larger share of
their stock and moved a consid
erable amount of it across the
street. Their loss was brought
about largely through smoke and
water. At several times the Gil
"beilson store to the south was in
imminent danger and although
Ihe roof suffered damage and the
flumes at one time leaped through
a rear window and slightly burn
ed the wall the heaviest damage
is by virtue of smoke and water.
The stock in the Emporium
appears to the writer to be prac
tically a total loss and the build
ing is injured to a large extent.
In an interview with Mr. Schweitz
er this (Saturday) morning he
aid that he had insurance but
'that he did not think it would
much more than half cover the
loss as he had cancelled some of
the insurance he carried not long
II^O.
Various opinions are being ex
pressed as to the origin of the fire.
Some contend that it is the work
of an incendiary, while others are
of the opinion that it was caused
by a lighted match, cigarete or
cigar thrown in refuse to the rear
of the buildings by some prowler,
presumable a transient. It is gen
erally believed and every evidence
goes to prove, howrever, that the
buildings caught from the out
side.
The Beach Fire Department is
worthy of commendation for their
work this morning, as well as
that which they have done in
!he past, and they should be an
preeiated by every property
owner in Beach as they are ever
-willing and ready to do their ut
termost to save property loss.
George F. Noble formerly em
ployed at the Parson's Machine
Shop made a deal the first of the
•week whereby he takes over the
Kinney blacksimth shop. It is his
intention to transform it into a
first class garage although he will
do blacksmithing and general re
pair work of all kinds. His
tcbarges for completely overhaul
ing a Ford car will be but $12 and
he guarantees his work to be sat
isfactory or no charge will be
rinade. "Good service and reason
able prices" will be his slogan
and we predict for him a very
jgood business.
Fire Practically Destroys Ladies'
Emporium This Saturday Morning
€ilbertson and Hoffman Bros. Also Suffer Loss. The
Cause of the Conflagation is Still Unknown.
At between 3:15 and 3:30 this morning (Saturday) Beach people were aroused by the siren call
of Ihe fire whistle and those who vent to the trouble of getting up witnessed the putting out of a
fire that might have gained more ciisasterous proportions than any ever having occurred here.
As we understand it, the fire was discovered by men who were eating at Wall's Eat Shop after
having returned from a dance, and at the time of its discovery the whole rear of the Ladies' Empor
ium, owned by Theo. Schweitzer, and a portion of the rear of Hoffman Brothers' Confectionery and
Ice Cream parlors were on fire. The flames leaped high, into the a*r and those who went to their
windows could easily see them, or the reflection they cast.
Wm. Gilbert
Loses His Life
Meets With Fatal Accident in N.
P. Yard Here Last Monday.
An accident so terrible that the
entire city was shocked as it has
not been in years before, occur
red here last Monday noon when
William Gilbert lost his life in
ihe railroad yards near the J. R.
Smith elevator, as the result of an
accident. Judging by the best
information we were able to se
cure the accident occurred when
the south branch train was
switching in the yards prepara
tory to making its usual run
down the south branch. Mr.
Gilbert being employed as a
l-inkeman was in the act of ad
justing a brake and as it was
much easier to turn than he had
expected.he lost his balance and
fell, the car passing completely
o\er his body and severing it in
twain. Death was instantaneous
and the body was mangled hor
ribly.
Those who found the remains
and saw a portion of the accident
notified the proper authorities at
once, who arrived immediately
and upon an examination of eye
witnesses found that his death
was purely accidental and that no
blame could in any way be laid
on the train crew.
Funeral services were held
Tuesday afternoon at Sentinel
Butte, Rev. Kessinger of this city
officiating, and interment was
made in the cemetery there. A
large number from here were in
attendance to pay their last tri
bute to one whom was rjespected
and whose acquaintance was
treasured by all who knew him.
The deceased was born August
23, 1875 at London, Ontario, Can
ada and came to Sentinel Butte
with the rest of the family in
1S82. He took up railroading as
his life's work and for a long
time worked in the capacty of
hrakeman on the main line, work
ing between Dickinson and Glen
dive Upon the completion of the
south branch he took a like posi
tion on it in order that he might
remain at home with relatives a
greater part of the time. He was
a man of quiet disposition and
was held in the highest esteem not
oily by friends in this city and
community but by all the rail
road men with whom he had ever
worked or came in contact.
The following relatives are left
to mourn his untimely death: an
aged mother, Mrs. Henry Gilbert
of this city four brothers, Ed
ward Gilbert of Beach, Charley,
Albert, Fred and Harry of Senti
nel Butte, and two sisters, Mrs.
Christie Howard of Dickinson and
Mrs. Otto Stensrud of Beach.
It is useless for the writer to
try and express in words the sym
pathy that is extended by all who
knew the deceased to the sorrow
ing family, as words are to feeble
to describe it. His many friends
grieve with them and his valued
acquaintance will be missed by
far more than is ordinarily im
agined.
VETE KERRIGAN DIED
LAST SATURDAY.
Friends and relatives here were
grieved last Saturday upon hearing
of Ihe death of Pete Kerrigan at
t'iie hospital in Dickinson, the
morning of the same day. Mr.
Kerrigan was taken to the hospit
al there several weeks ago, suffer
ing at the time with an attack of
typhoid fever. Complications set
in and although everything in the
way of medical aid was done for
him it was of no avail and he
passed to the great beyond.
The remains were brought' to
this city and funeral services
were held in the Catholic church
Wednesday /morning, interment
being made in the Catholic cemet
ery.
There are left to mourn their
loss, five brothers and two sisters,
Ed, George and Pat of this city,
two brothers and a sister residing
in St. Paul and Mrs. R. S. Sher
man of Miles City.
To the sorrowing relatives is
extended the sympathy of this
entire community, in which Pete
had a large number of friends.
Jesse Bates, a land man from
Baraboo, Wisconsin visited over
Sunday here at the Judge Stod
dard home. He spent several days
in the vicinity of Wibaux, near
where he intends buying a large
ranch.

McCUMBER S CLERK IN
ERROR REGARDING 640
ACRE HOMESTEAD BILL
Washington, July 30, 101(.
My dear Mr. Waters:
I have an apology to offer you.
On July 19th I was in the Senate
Chamber when the 040 acre home
stead bill came up. There were
certain amendments made and
these amendments were agreed to
and the bill had really passed the
Senate, Senator Sterling and
Senator Borah had withdrawn the
objections they had made and the
call for regular order was made.
I left the Senate Chamber then
with the firm conviction that the
bill passed. The next day I
looked at the record and saw the
amendments that had been agreed
to and did not pursue the matter
any further but telegraphed you
to the effect that the 640 acre
homestead bill had passed. I
sent that telegram in Senator
McCumber's name which is cus
tomary for the clerks to do. Later
on in talking with the Senator he
staled that Smoot had objected to
the bill and that it had not passed.
I insisted that it had, and we
looked up the record and found
that he was correct and that
although the bill had really
passed, inasmuch as the Senate
was working under the unani
mous consent agreement, the bill
went back to the Senate Calendar.
It has not yet passed the Senate.

A number of newspaper corres
pondents made the same mistake
as I did and telegraphed out that
the bill had passed. Both Senator
MeCumber and Gronna are work
ing for the passage of the bill and
1 think they will he successful
and that we will get the bill
passed before the adjournment,
of this Congress. It certainly
puts me into a hole, or rather I
put Senator MeCumber into a hole
in telegraphing you that the bill
had passed and signing his name
to the telegram. I think the bill
will pass within the next few
clays. This is the first time in my
fifteen or sixteen years in Wash
ington that I ever sent out any
information that was not correct
and I trust the you will excuse it
as it was a mistake made not only
by myself but by the newspaper
men in the City.
Very truly yours,

Multitude of Beach
People Greeted Hughes Today
Amid Waving of Flags He Tells Crowd What to Expect
If He is Elected President.
Conservative judges estimate tfie crowd at considerable over 1000 assembled at the rail
road crossing on Blanche Street today (Friday) at 1:05 p. in. to hear Charles E. Hughes deliver
the five minute address he made concerning his candidacy as the Republican candidate for President.
The speech, short as it was, by the Republican candidate, was a keynote speech, indeed. Not one
person in the large audience asse nhled was in doubt for a moment as to just what he meant by
what he said. It was comprehensive, logical, clear and as sufficient as was possible considering the
amount ot time he had to deliver it in. Those who heard him, agree as to this. Plainly Mr. Hughes
is a man "who knows what he wants when lie wants it," and it isgenerally conceded that he knows
how to get it.

Autoist Was Filling Car With
Gasoline When Oil Exploded

Serious Arccident.
Dickinson, N. D. Aug. 7.—Ex
ploding gasoline nearly killed
Robert Kastien, of this city, but
he prevented the explosion of a
big tank of gasoline by his Jjrav
erv.
Engaged in filling an automo
bile with gas, the fluid took fire,
and Kastien was caught in the
fiiunes. The fire beginning runn
ing up the hose to the main lank,
and in preventing its spread he
himself was badly burned.
N. B. —Robert Kastien is the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Kastien of
Beach, and has many friends
here who arc grieved to learn of
his serious accident.
Tt is with pleasure lhat we are
able to inform our readers that
Mrs. Pete Palmer is now improv
ing nicely from the two opera
tions she underwent at the Dick
inson hospital about three weeks
aj?.o. For some time after the op
erations her condition was very
critical and her friends here have
been anxiously hoping for news
of her improvement.

NUMBER 43
As we have said before, it was
iiicumbent upon Mr. Hughes to
confine the limitations of his re
|marks to the limit of time he had
to deliver them in, but his crush
ing analysis of the shortcomings
of the present adminstration of
the government is merely a syn
iojisis of what he will have to say
where he has the opportunity of
making a longer slay.
In saying that he believed in
"preparedness not for aggression,
hut for protection" and the de«
manding of the respect in the
world of nations that this country
is entitled to, he made a decided
hit with his audience. Again, in
promising that in case of his
election the so-called "pork bar
rel" would be a thing of the past,
much applause prevailed.
In closing Mr. Hughes wished
the people of Golden Valley pros
perity supreme, and amid hand
clapping and waving of flags
made his departure westward, the
next stop being Glcndive.
The Beach band, in full uni
form, played a national air as the
special train arrived and also as
it left, and the editor of this paper
as a member of the press gang on
the way up from Dickinson, can
vouch for the fact that everyone
connected with the party was
truly appreciative of their pre
sence, as well as of the crowd
that had turned out to hear our
next president, Mr. Hughes.
It might be well to add that
when the coast to coast tour was
scheduled from New York, Beach
was left out, hut that through an
arrangement made by J. R.
Waters through Senator P. J.
MeCumber, Golden Valley people
were given an opportunity of
hearing the Republican standard
hearer. J. P. Reeves, as chairman
of the Republican County Com
mittee lent every effort possible
toward making a surely of the
snecial train stopping here and
those who heard Mr. Hughes
should give these gentlemen cred
it tor the opportunity they had
and of which they look advan
tage.
