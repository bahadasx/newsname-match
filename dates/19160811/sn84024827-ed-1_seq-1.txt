Charges Preferred.
With her spirits unbroken. In spite
of bruises on her back, due to a strap

punishment, and also in spite of being
tied in a larec morris chair for two
hours, hungry and thirsty. Laura Mc
C'loskey, the five year adopted daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Alva McCIos-.
key. was found last evening by Night
Chief of Police A. E. Kempton when
he entered the house in response to
information brought to him by one of
the neighbors.
The McClo'skey'g live in the Cunard
Flats, located on School ' Hill. Last
evening Officer Kempton was fold
that the little daughter, Laura, was in
the house and calling to the neighbor
children who were playing outside, for
water and something to e3t. The of
ficer was also told the mother of the
child had left about an hour and a
l half before.
Kempton went to the house and
managed to get Inside without forc
ing any door. He found the little
girl, who is fair haired, beautiful as
e picture, and spirited, as could be
imagined in a five year old child, tied
with ropes in a large morris chair.
When the officer released the young
ster she attempted to eat a dry piece
of bread, which was - upon the table
near at hand. She also asked for
water, declaring she was thirsty.

brought her water and told her he
would see that she got plenty to eat
The surroundings Indicated that the
mother had left the esUblishment

dishes and without clearing the table.
The child told the officer that her
father was working in the mines.

said Laura. "Sometime they gives
me a bath on Sunday." This and
many other expressions came from
her lips. She told of being whipped
yesterday by her father,' who used a
belt The child's little back was black
and blue and several bruises were
more than noticeable upon the arms.
Several of the neighbors declare last
evening's occurance was not the first
ot the same character. They add that
the child is often left alone.
Little Laura was taken to the Y.
W. C. A. last evening and put in
charge of the Probation Officer, who
saw that she was well fed and happy
for the night and who also said the
child had more nerve, was spoiled;
more than most youngsters. Officer
Kempton signed a complaint charging
both mother and father of the child
with cruelty to children. Neither had
been found up to a late hour.

COPENHAGEN, Aug 10. The first
reading of the bill providing for the
sale of the Danish West Indies to the
United States was taken in the Folke
thing. the lower house of Rigsdag to
day and will be continued tonight.
It Is believed that the Tolkething will
adopt the measure owing to the fact
that the radical and socialistic par
ties, which have a majority, favor the
sale.
Upper House Feared.
On tae other hand, the Lansdthing,
or upper house, it is thought Is op
posed to the measure, the Left party
having joined the conservatives who
desire to postpone consideration of
the matter. Considering the matter
today there was no action in the house
and some women among the specta
tors shouted "we will not sell."
Cabinet Jo See It Through.
The foreign minister Eric de Scha
nenius in opening the debate recom
mended ratification of the sale. It
was for the rigsdag now to make a
final decision.
Say U. S. May Grab It
The minister of finance emphasized
the necessity for the sale. Those who
opposed the sale he continued, had an
easy task but the government was un
able to divulge its chief arguments in
favor of the sale, for instance, if the
United States took possession of the
islands, should Denmark declare war
against the United Slates or appeal
to Europ". The fn-i-nintont felt
bound to submit to the desire of a
great state; the government regretted
that the colors had to be lowered,
but when a hurricane was blowing one
had to run before it.

Lewis Explanation.
The expression "too proud to fight"
used at Philadelphia by the President
to an audience of courageous. Chris

an old question from the classics
antient as the scriptures. Its mean
ing is known to be that a brave peo

fight whence a concession of what
was risht would bring justice to all.
The president presumed on the Intel
