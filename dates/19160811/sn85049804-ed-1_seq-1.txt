THE STATE INDUSTRIAL AND
AGRICULTURAL FAIR.
This is a new organization among
the colored people, having held the
seventh annual session at the Cen
tral Baptist church, North Topeka,
Kans., last September. The founder
is Rev. H. W. White, D. D., of To
peka, Kans. The object is to en
courage our people along industrial
and agricultural lines. One of the
prime objects is to organize a so
ciety in each community and let that
society rent the vacant lots and plot
of ground in their city and have
their boys and girls to put it into
small crops and offer prizes for the
best crop raised in the city, selling
the products for the support of the
society. Rev. White would be glad to
come and lecture and explain his
plan in full if you would write him.
Write him at No. 206 Curtis street,
North Topeka, Kans. They will hold
several fairs this year in Kansas.
EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
In our last week's letter we used
the name of Rev. B. F. Hubbard as
being the pastor of the A. M. E.
church at Burlington. It was wrong.
Wo meant to say Rev. B. N. Penn, as
he is the pastor in charge in Burl
ington and he is doing well. He is
an active young man. Keokuk we
next made our abode for three days.
We found Father Orange Fields, one
of the best known and oldest citizens
here, still sick. He was stricken down
when we was there last August and
has been confined more or less to his
bed ever since. Mr. Fields is that
type of a real race man whose pow
erful influence has been for fifty odd
years for the highest and best in this
community. His only single daugh
ter is Miss Artisha, an accomplished
sensible young lady. His good wife
makes lifepleasant for him. Messrs.
W. W. Gross, Alonzo A. Draine,
Fielding Johnson are all still on the
U. S. mail service as carriers. They
are fine specimens of the younger
Afro-Americans in this country, upon
whom the destinies of our race rest.
The former is our grand secretary of
the Masonic grand lodge. All of these
men are active Masons. Mr. Fields
is the present master of Old Union,
No. 1. Mr. Gross's only daughter is
now a student in the State University
at Iowa City. Selby Johnson, a well
to-do citizen, is still on the single list.
He lives in his beautiful home on
High street. He was preparing to
make a visit to the south, also to Chi
cago, and perhaps Des Moines, be
fore returning home. He is a race
man and a good citizen. A1 J. Fields
is still running his grocery store. His
lovable wife ably assists him. They
are doing well, having been in busi
ness about ten years. Rev. J. H.
Helm is pastor of Pilgrim Rest church
and is still hammering the gospel in
to his hearers. He has been here
longer than any other colored min
ister and has the largest membership
and attendance of any church in the
city, mostly all due to his labor, as
sisted by Dr. J. H. Phillips. The lat
ter owns and conducts a large sani
tarium on Eighteenth and Palean
streets, where he treats all kinds of
diseases. Nearly all of his patients
are white people. He owns valuable
property. John D. Bland is back in
his large blacksmith shop with a
large fyisiness as usual. French
Bland is still working at the same
place. He owns a beautiful home on
High street. Austin A. Bland Is still
operating his hotel, doing well. He
is well fixed financially and is enjoy
ing life nicely at 81 years old. His
highly cultured wife will accompany
him to Chicago on August 21 to at
tend the' grand Masonic conclave.
Mrs. J. C. Craig owns a nice home.
Mrs. E. A. Summers has a nice home.
She has a fiye-passenger automobile,
just purchased it. Samuel Johnson is
doing well. Mr. and Mrs. Tebeau own
a beautiful home. Their only son is
now home on his vacation ,from How
ard university. Mrs. Tebeau has
charge of .the Keokuk Golf club house
v* jyv ^,-V "«M W
this summer. Mrs. G. W. Smith on
1609 Timea street .entertained ye edi
tor at a 6 o'clock dinner. They are
doing well. The Peerless Ice Cream
Co. has opened up an ice cream par
lor and confectionery store at 1126
Fulton and these young men are hav
ing a lafge trade. They are hustlers.
The Widow Clemmens is still living
and having good health for a lady of
her age. Mr. and Mrs. Freeman are
still running a restaurant. They
seem to have a good trade, also Mrs.
Mitchell has an ice cream parlor and
restaurant, doing well. W. H. Jones
is still in the tonsorial business, the
oldest barber in business in Keokuk.
His two sons .help him. They own a
beautiful and valuable home. Mr.
and Mrs. Geo. Snoddy at 1326 Orleans
street own a valuable property. They
are doing well. Mr. F. D. Holmes is
still in the ice business, doing well,
especially this hot summer. Mrs. H.
Dade is running a confectionery store
at her home, doing a nice little busi
ness. Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Kellis are
working at the same place. Dr.
Flomanry is still practicing here. W.
B. Taylor, with some others, has^
opened a pool hall and soft drink'
store on Main street. They are do
ing a fine business. Mr. Frank Fields
is still operating his barber shop on
Main street, with good results.
From here we drove over to near
Farmington, where we spent the
night at the home of Mr. Ross, a
well-to-do farmer, who has lived in
this county for nearly fifty years. He
has just sold his farm of 107 acres.
He has only one child staying with
him now, Miss Lizzie, a very bright
and conservative young woman. Ye
editor being once a farmer could all
the more appreciate the generous
hospitality of this successful farmer.
A Miss Bailey, who spent last winter
in Des Moines with Mrs. Buckner,
died and was buried in this neighbor
hood this Sunday morning. A large
crowd of farmers, both white and col
ored, were in attendance at the funer
al. Her sister, Miss Lillian, recently
married Dr. Phillips. The Baileys
are old settlers out here. Mr. Holt
is another old settler, as is also the
two Mr. Buckners, who are brothers,
and each owns valuable farms here.
The Mr. Youngs also own a nice
farm. Also Mr. Ashbys own a fine
farm. From Mr. Russ's country home
I started for Keosauqua. On arriv
ing within eight miles of this town
the axle gear rod of my auto broj^e
going down a steep hill and my steer
ing wheel became helpless ,and we all
ran into a bridge. If the machine
had not struck the post that held the
bridge we would have fallen over an
embankment of twenty feet deep. It
took three men to pry us out and six
hours to repair the wreck. ^.We final
ly reached Keosauqua. Here we found
about 100 colored people and the only
county seat town in Iowa that we did
not find any paved streets. Mr. and
Mrs. John Johnson own a nice home.
Mr. Wm. Green is a real race man.
He is a hustler. M. J. Bradford, Ben
Dickson and Oce Howard are doing
well. John H. Buckner is a success
ful contractor. Mr. Garrett and
Crawford folks are doing well.

above unique picture shows Miss Ruth Law and the trail of brlW
liance snapped by the camera man during one of her sensational night
rides In her aeroplane. Miss Law Is what might be called a high
flyer, literally, for she holds the altitude record for women. At a
recent aviation meet at the famous old Sheepshead Bay Park she beat all pre*
vlous records for women by flying to a height of 11,500 feet, more than two
miles. As the picture Indicates, Miss Law does ail the thrilling stunts prac
ticed by her brother aviators, who, though of the sterner sex, have nothing
whatever on Miss Law when It comes to stern stuff and stunts. She will be
daily attraction at the Iowa State Fair, her contract calling for three flights
every day—two in the afternoon and one in the evening. The contract also
specifies not less than three loops to be executed during each Bight Miss Law
will prove the sensation of the coming fair.'

and pray with him. He also had
family prayers daily during his last
illness. Twenty years ago he became'
a member of the African Methodist
Episcopal church.
