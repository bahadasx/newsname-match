Without Help of OUicr
I'arty Leaders.
WAHHINGTi IN, Aug. 10. Their of
fer of a compromise legislative pro
gram which might lead to an arly ad
journment of congress, rejected by the
Republicans, Democratic senate lead
ers decided tonight to drive along
wunoui itopunncun co-operation in an
enort to dispose of pending legisla
tion by September 1.
Republican leaders who had given
the democrats hope that their ad
journment proposal might be accepted
were unable to control the party con
ference which took un the matter to
day for ratification.
Progressive Republicans, led bv
Senators horah, Morris and I-i Jul
iette, refused to le bound by any pro
gram which would prevent ac tion on
the corrupt practices, willows nension
civil war veterans' retirement and im
migration bills.
The result was that resolution was
adopted rejecting the Di moc ratio
adjournment.
It was the first time in several
years that Senator Im Folletto had
ati ended a party conference.
I 'emocratio senators said tnn-i-iii
that no change in the legislative uro
gram drafted recently by the party
caucus now was contemplated. They
were hopeful that the .shipping and
revenue bills and conference n.nnriu
could be disrosed of und adjourn
