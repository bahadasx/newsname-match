Commissioner Watson Tells .of the
Damage to the Public Roads?
Spartanburg- Moving to Rebuild
Mountain Highway.
Suecial to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Aug. 9.?'Reports from
various sections of the State are being
received by Commissioner E.y J.
Watson in regard to the damage to
bridges and highways by the recent
floods. All bridges over the Oatawba-Wateree
course were destroyed,
which has practically cut off the
lower section of the State from the
Piedmont, in the matter of public
highway travel.
The Commissioner announced this
morning that information received in
hi's office was to the effect that the
Piedmont highway from Greenville
and Poinsett Springs to Asheville and
Andersonville lias been opened up,
and is in good condition. Considerable
damage was wrought between Melrose
and Saluda, on the Appalachian
highway between Spartaburg, Hendersonville
and Asheville, and work is
being -pushed to put the road in con
dition.
Mr. Paul V. Moore, of the Spartanburg
Chamber of Commerce, thus
writes Commissioner Watson with
reference to the roads through
Spartanburg to the mountains:
"Of course our up country roads
were badly washed, and traffic on the
Appalachian highway has been temTwirarilv'
suspended. The Spartan
burg Chamber of Commerce, however,
has taken this roiad in hand and has
raised a sum of $1,200, which is to be
expended between Tryon and Saluda.
Advice -by phone today states that this i
road will be open for travel by Friday
of this week. Green River bridge,
beyond "Saluda, is being rebuilt, and
we hope to reach Hendersonville by
Saturday night.'*
Commissioner fW&tson announced j
that the road between Columbia and
Spartanburg is in good condition except
just this side of 'Spartanburg,

Florence, Aug. 8.?Farm lands of
the Pee Dee are as soggy as river
swamps and as plows must stand idly
gy voters of Florence county turned
aside to the diversion of hearing the
candidates of tlie State campaign party.
As" many as 1,000 voters attended
the meeting with little show of en- j
thusiasm and slight inclination to play |
favorites. Gov. Manning. R. A. Coop-1

'Mr. Blease was the first speaker and j

upon Gov. Manning, charging
that his farewell speech as commander-in-chief

about to start for; the border was

patriotism or duty. The governor

! R. A. Cooper made his usual speech,
' pledging impartial enforcement of all
i laws and promising to be the governbr
of all the people. "Any man who goes
| into office to be the governor of his
j friends only and to punish his enemies
is not fit to hold office," tlie Laurens
cqunty candidate told the peo
| pie. Criminals, lie declared, would
j serve their sentences. He could not
t promise tax reduction, but would attempt
to give 100 cents for the ^ollar.
The only inspiring element J. M.
jjesunainps nas aiscoverea in tiie campaing
is the "rag cheering'' feature, he
said. He has contemplated the establishment
of af puper manufacturing
plant, and he would engage the candidate
for the fine art of munching
the rags for paper tissue. "If you
don't believe South Carolina has bee'i
held up to ridicule, sneered at, cussed
and scoffed at, go 1,000 miles beyond
?
your border and find out what the
other fellow says." Enough seeds of
anarchy, he said, had been sown in
South Carolina to require 50 years of
statesmanship to eliminate.
John T. Duncan spoke next.
Gov. (Manning was the last speaker,
but the crowd had waited patiently in
a sweltering sun to hear him, and
many crowded into the court bouse
entrance to speake to him when he
had finished.
He had kept his promises of two
years ago, he told the people. He reviewed
the acts of his administration
relative to the enforcemen of la^,
the passcisre of progressive legislation

economical administration. The overj
shadowing issue in this campaign was

made in this direction and he reviewed

a state of bnazen violation o? law a
strong sentiment for enforcement has
crystalized. No true bills were re
