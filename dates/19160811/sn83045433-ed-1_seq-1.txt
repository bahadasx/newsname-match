AIM AT TRIESTE
Armies of Duke of Aosta At
tack Enemy on Thirty-Mile
Front-Hold San Michele.
(my the Internatlemal News servie.)
London, Aug. 10.-With Gorisia firmly
tn their hands, the Italian armies of the
Dnke of Acosta are attacking the Aus
trian lines on a front of thirty miles in
their drive on Trieste.
Torriffic fighting is being waged on the
lofty Alpine summits which rise up out
of the Isonzo Valley. The Italians are
now in complete control of the four crests
of Monte San Michele, and hold a firm
foothold on the Doberdo Plateau, a part
of the vast Carso Plateau, across which
their advance to Trieste must be made.
Amid the cheers of his soldiers, King
Victor rmmanuel has himself entered
Gorista. over which the royal flag again
fies after a lapse of many years.
The Austrians. in a desperate effort to
halt the successful Italian operation.s on
the lower Isonzo. are delivering furious
attacks at many other points along the
front. According to a statement received
tonight from Romp. th-ese have been uni
formly repulsed.
More than 12X"0 Austrian prisoners have
been brought In, Rome officially announc
es. while the Austrian dead choke the
mountain gullies and fill the caves and
caverns which they had converted Into
artillery positions.
The last peak of Monte San Michele
was captured after a flotilla of Italian
dirigibles had dropped tons of high ex
p.osives upon the Austrian gun emplace
ments
Vienna claims to have halted the Ital
lan advance across the Doberdo Plateau
and to have captured more than yoA pri
soners
The Austrian lines have now heen
straightened, it is announced, the Italians
offering no opposition, following the re
pulse of their efforts to advance.

London, Aug. In-A midsummer storm

on both the British and French fronts
in Picardy. At Verdun another luil has

tiu-ing the last -: hours.
In the operations north of the
Somme the allies were the ag
gressors and registered fresh gains it
both the principal sectors of their present
attacks. The French pressed further for
ward in the district north of the Hem
Wonoi, whie the British 1lared further
positions northwest of Pozieres.
The German resistance to the French
attacks is notlcably stiffening. Eight sepa
rate assaults were repulsed last night on
the Maurepas-Siomme sector of which the
Hem Wood is a part, according to an of
tal statement received from Berlin. The
statement adds that British attacks near
Bazentin Leepit failed before the German

Intense aerial activity at many points
of the front, despite the unfavorable at
mospheric conditions. More than eight
aeroplanes have been shot to earth.
Five were either French or British.
Three German machines are known In

J. B. FABER'S NAME USED
ERRONEOUSLY IN STORY
The article in The Washington Herald
of August 4 concerning J. B. FLaber, an
attorney, of Tacoma Park. was Incorrect.
The article said in part that Mr. Faber
"got Dr. Benjamin R. Logie, superin
tendent of the Chevy Chase Sanitarium.
and two of his assistants into a lot of
trouble when he started to take 'French
leave' while being escorted to the sani
tarium for treatmnent."
Mr. Faber was not a patient at the
sanitarium and was not being escorted
there for treatment. Mr. Faber saw Dr.
Logie and a sanitarium nurse trying to
control a patient who had just left the
irstittion to come to this hity. Mr.
Faber offered his assistance to Dr. Logie
and later induced an autoist to lend his
machine to Dr. Logie for the conveyance
of the patient to the sanitarium.
The error was due to the use of Mr.
Fabers name instead of the name of the
sanitarium patient.
