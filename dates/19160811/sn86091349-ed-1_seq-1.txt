CLOUDBURSTS CAUSE
WASHOUT OX RAILROAD
Cloudbursts last Saturday after
noon caused serious washouts on the
Caliente & Pioche railroad, the result
of which -Pioche has been cut off
from railroad communication this
week. The flat below town, from a
point Just to the north of Four Mile
and down the valley was covered
with several feet of water and wash
ed the road bed out along the rail
road for a distance of about 1 100
feet. The water came pouring down
the gulches from both sides of the
valley for several hours and the old
est inhabitant declares that never in
the history of this country has there
ever been such a volume of water on
the fiat at one time before. But the
worst havoc was played to the rail
road in Condor canyon where several
bridges are washed away, and in a
few places nothing was left except
the ties and bent rails to show that
there ever had been a railroad in the
canyon. In the vicinity of Bullion-
ville, the water spread out over the
valley, but not until the track had
been, covered here and there with
sodden debris.
The railroad company set at work
immediately, however., to make re
pairs so as to restore traffic at the
earliest ; possible moment..' Mean
while the Prince Consolidated com
pany was obliged to stop operations
Sunday morning and the mine re
mained out of commission until Wed
nesday.
The Amalgamated Pioche mine
was not affected by the flood, as the
company had plenty of fuel on hand
to keep things going. The mill has
been grinding away steadily and pil
lng up concentrate tor shipment as
soon as normal traffic conditions
again prevail.
Train Service Again
The washout between Pioche and
Caliente was repaired yesterday when
the first train since last Saturday
arrived.

WYOMING SENATOR'S BILL
TO IMPROVE HIGHWAY
A good roads bill has been report
ed to the senate by the senate com
mittee on public lands, which, If It
becomes a law, will give the public
land states of the west an oppor
tunity not only to Improve public
roads in these states but to utilize
to advantage large areas of public
land now comparatively unproduc
tive, v
i ne Dili in question propses to
grant to each of the states of Neva
da, Colorado, Idaho, , Montana, New
Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, North Da
kota, California, Oregon, and Wash
ington, 500,000 acres of unreserved
non-mineral, surveyed public lands,
the proceeds of the sales of which
are to be used solely for the pur
pose of constructing, repairing and
maintaining public wagon roads.
The original proposition to cede
public lands to the western states
for the benefit of public roads was
embraced in a bill introduced by Sen
ator Warren of Wyoming. In the
sexty-second congress, proposing to
grant lands to the statelet Wyoming
for road purposes.
This bill was not favored by the
interior department, but the senator
reintroduced it in the sixty-third con
gress when he also Introduced a bill
granting public lands to each of the
various western public land states
for the construction and improve
ment of public roads.
PROSPECTING IN
GROOME DISTRICT
Just at this moment no part of
southern Nevada has the opportuni
ties for prospecting as the section
lying adjacent to Groome in Lincoln
county. In the early days .there was
considerable work done in and about
Irish mountain; Tern Piute and other
camps were started and produced a
large tonnage ot rich silver ore which
the "Crime of 73" put out of bus!
ness.
The wrecks of thes old camps are
yet vlsable and it would seem now
with silver at 65 and with auto
truck for transportation facilities
and the new methods ot milling, of
which nothing was known by those
old pioneers, there should be some
good things picked up and worked
to a successful outcome In the sec
tion named.
From Hiko to Groome is a most
inviting section for the gay and fes
tive prospector, who has the time
and patience to follow "The Call
of the Wild," and there with his
compaions, the John rabbit and the
coyote, with ever and anon a yellow
hammer or two, diligently seek out
the metal that in the ground has no
value and is of no value until turn
ed Into real money.
There is little doubt but the sec
tion also between, Irish mountain
and Freiberg would make good, at
any rate that whole district for 50
miles square Is well worthy of con
sideration with every likelihood ot
the values in paying quantities being
found and producing another bunch
of millionaires. Little does the pros
pector know what is In store for
him and as a matter of fact the man
with "Never-rlpa" on today may have
a real serge from Kahn's on tomor
row and money to back up the
change. He also has In Bight no
doubt ever in his dreams one of
those little tin machines retailed all
over the country for $399 and it's
astonishing how quickly money seeks
Its own level, like water, in a Hank
Ford.
PIOCHE ASSAY OFFICE
vrv iv vww uivnu
A business change was announced
ye&terday when E. C. D. Marriage
took over the management of the
Pioche Assay Office, which had been
conducted for several years past by
C H. Snyder. The business was es
tablished some years ago by Mr. Mar
riage who conducted the nlace
successfully for a period of five
years, when he disposed of the prop
erty to Mr. Snyder that he might
give his attention to other Interests.
Now he is taking back the same bus
iness and It is needless to say that
he will make a success of it. Mr.
Marriage understands assaying and
everything which pertains to that
line of work and with the assistance
of Mr. Carl Austerman. who has had
many years' experience as an assayer
and chemist, the Pioche Assay Office
will be prepared to meet all local de
mands.
GOVERNMENT EMPIjOYMEXT
OFFICE OPENED AT RENO
1One of the government free em
ployment offices, which were lately
recommended by congress, will be

Neil McGee who will have charge of
the office and Mr. McGee 'expects to
have the place open for business in

resident of the state for several
yeras and is well acquainted with
conditions, lie was formerly a mem
ber of the Nevada industrial com-
.mission. -Lovelock Review-Miner.
GOODSPRINGH STORM i
y.. WORSE THAN REPORTED
The magnitude of the storm of last
Thursday can only be appreciated by
those who actually saw the great
mass of floodwaters as It tore Its de
vastating path through the south
draw of Spring Mountain range.. The
storm itself proved to be a freak. It
traveled In the form 'of a horseshoe
from north of Potosl mountain thence
south until It struck Goodsnrlnea.
then turning north again, crossed the
railroad tracks above Arden, working
much havoc among the ranches to the
south of Las 'Vegas and continued
on the Eldorado canyon. Its path
was not more than a mile in width.
It was a surprising fact that it avoid
ed all the high altitudes. It passed
close to both 'Potosl and Charleston
mountains, but only a slight sprinkle
reached these high ' elevations.

Arcane Company To
Start Mr CiijE S
According to information impart
ed to the Record by H. W. Rand, who
was in the city this week on mining
business, the financing of the proper
ties taken over some time ago by the
Arcane Mining company has been ac
complished and It Is expected that an
active campaign of mining will be
inaugurated about the first of the
coming month. .
It Is understood that prominent
Chicago capitalists have become in
terested in the company after having
received the report of Col. W. A. Far-
ish, the veteran mining engineer, who
was sent here several months ago for
the purpose ot conducting an exam
ination of the ground. The report
submitted by Col. Farlsh was highly
satisfactory who is reported to have
said that there is little ot doubt the
MARRIAGE ANNOUNCES
CANDIDACY FOR COMMISSIONER
In his issue appears the announce
ment of E. C. D. Marriage who as
pires to fill the position of county
commissioner. He will be a candi
date before the Democratic county
convention and will seek the nomi
nation for the long term commis
sionershlp. ,
Mr. Marriage needs no introduc
tion to the people of Lincoln county
as he Is well known to all, particu
larly in Pioche and the northern pre
cincts where his business has brought
him in contact with the residents.
Mr. Marriage has been a close stu
dent of county affairs and believes
himself to be well qualified to know
the needs of the county and it will
be his purpose, in case of his nomi
nation : and election, to endeavor to
conduct the business of the county us
far as it would lie within his power
along strictly business lines. , lie Is
t property owner and taxpajer. his
Interests being In real estao an-!

ger of the Pioche Assay offlc Mi.
Mai rlage has , i o axes to grind, no
p.'vate Interests that ,v;i'l be pre
Jr.dinial to the count welfare in
any way. In other words, if chosen
as a member of the board ot ountv
commissioners he would endeavor t.
do his plain duty as he sees it. He
bus been a resident of the county for
irore than ten years, has held a posi
tion of responsibility with the Amal
gamated Pioche company anl has
been successful In conducting his
own business affairs.
CHRISTENSEN TO RUN
INDEPENDENT FOR SHERIFF
In this issue appears the announce
ment of C. P. Christensen, who has
decided to come before the voters ot
the county as an independent candi
date for the office of sheriff. Mr.
Christensen has served as deputy un
der Sheriff Dan J. Ronnow, ever
since the latter has occupied the high
and important office of sheriff; first
as deputy at Caliente and at the pre
sent time deputy and Jailer at Pioche
which place he has filled since the
death of that old-time and highly
respected peace officer Jacob John
son.
As a consequence of his long ser
vices as a public officer, Mr. Chris
tensen has become well known to
practically every resident of the
county, experience is sometimes a
big asset in one's career and the fact
that Mr. Christensen has been in of
fice, having been a, faithful lieuten
ant of Sheriff Ronnow, and knows
all of the Ins and outs ot the duties
of that office, his friends declare,
makes him a logical candidate to suc
ceed his present chief. Mr. Chris
tensen will have his petitions cir
culated to gain the required number
ot signatures; they will be sont out
during the next few days and filed
before the 5th of the coming month.
which will entitle him to a place on
the ballot to be voted in November.
. Examining the Habmurg
H. M. Johnson, maanger ot the
Uvada Copper company, arrived In
the city last Monday for the purpose
of making an examination of the
Hamburg mine in the Highland dis
development of immense bodies of
ore in the Arcane claims which lie
adjacent to those of the Amalgamat
ed Pioche from which , the latter to
supplying its mill. So well pleased
with the property was Col. Parish
that he declared he would like to
become one ot the directors of the
company and to have a say la the '
manner in which the dtvelopmeat
campaign shall be conducted.
The management of the Arcane
company expects to let the laltial
work out by contract and recommen
dations noted in the report of Col.
Farlsh will be followed.
The starting of an active cam
paign at the Arcane mine Is good
news and no doubt under proper di
rection it will become a producer of
considerable consequence in a short
time.
WAR TO LEAVE SILVER
WITH GREATER VALUES
In a letter to a friend in Gilpin
county, Colorado, U. 8. Senator
Charles S. Thomas discusses the fu
ture of silver. He ventured the pre
diction, at the time of the breaking
out of the European war, that one
of its ultimate and necessary results
would be the re-establishment of sil
ver as a money metal upon some
general and fixed ratio with gold.
"I did this because I believed and
still believe, first, that the effect of
the war upon exchange la gold nsiag
nations would be magnified by a cor
responding but more desirable fluctu
ation between gold and silver than it
ever had. . . Second, because gold ,
would disappear. from the esxreat
of trado In all the warring' countries
and silver would very naturally tU
Into the vacuum thus created, being
preferable to and perhaps an equally
good basis for paper currency. Third
and lastly, because the enormous cost :
of the war represented by debt of
striking proportions would necessi
tate resort to silver as the only .
means ot broadening the metallic
basis for money and credit. If I ami
correct in this forecast; the intrigues
of the money Interests can only re- "
tard their operation; the movement
cannot be avoided.
"I do not think the moneyed In
terests have had anything to do with,
the recent rise in sliver or its more N
recent fall to 62 cents. This la
one ot the spasmodic fluctuations in
the value of the commodity, which
are caused by sudden and temporary
demand. I think these are liable to
occur from time to time, resulting
in a permanent rise of the level of
market quotations. It Is too early to
predict a close of the war, and until
that arrives, little it anything will
be done for silver.
'When the war ends the total
debt of the belligerent and neu
tral European nations (who have
been obliged to be at all times on a
military basis at great expense), will
be far In excess of $100,000,000,009.
The annual Interest upon this sum
at five per cent represents $5,000,-
000,000, which added to the cost of
government operations, will mean an
annual tax upon their producing
masses of not less than $7,500,000,
000. This is much more than the to
tal productive wealth ot the coun
tries concerned, and means repudia
tion, unless silver comes to the res
cue ot gold. Even then, the nations
will have to stagger along under an
awful load for many years. If they
are ever to get out from under It.
Between repudiation and payment In
silver, the holders ot these national
soacritles will prefer the latter. I
therefore conclude that the interests
heretofore responsible for silver's
demonizatlon will be tfound amone
the champions ot that metal through
fie Mimulus of self interest." :
To'Caavass Rets
The county commissioners are re
quired to meet today for the purpose
ot canvassing the primary election
returns; but as there is little proba
bility of all the returns being la, U
commissioners will probably meet
again next Monday.
