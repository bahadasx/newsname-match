MEXICAN LOOTERS
BACKING HUGHES
INTERESTS SEEKING INTERVEN
TION FINANCE REPUBLICAN
NOMINEE'S CAMPAIGN.
"Hughes and intervention" is the
slogan of organized interests in .Mex
ico, composed, in the main, or Amer
ican interventionists, Huerta sympa-
thizers, big business with investments
in Mexico, friends of former Ambas
sador Henry Lane Wilson and others,
who are grooming themselves to do
yeoman service for the Republican
national committee in the coming
presidential campaign in the United
States, according to an article writ
ten by Robert H. Murray, Mexico
City correspondent of the New York
World.
Inspired by the hope which pos
sibly a Republican triumph in No
vember may bring them for armed
intervention in Mexico, and in which
American interventionists who are
either residents of Mexico or have
capital at stake in the republic, think
they see their only remaining chance
of bringing about the occupation of
Mexico by United States armies, these
persons already have placed them
selves in alliance with the Republic
an national committee.
For Hughes an<l Intervention.
There is every indication that they
have been received with open arms.
By the time the campaign is in full
swing, they expect to have their or
ganization ready to accomplish effi
cient work for Hughes and interven
tion. If the associated Mexican-
American interventionists are lis
tened to by Candidate Hugheß and
Chairman Wilcox, the major portion
Of the task of handling the Mexican
end of the campaign for the Repub
licans will be turned over to an or
ganization which now is being
formed, although theoretically, at
least, general supervision will be ex
ercised by the national committee.
One of the arguments calculated
to appeal to the committee will be an
undertaking by the associated Mexi
can-American interventionists to re
lieve the committee of all expense In
connection with the Mexican cam
paign bureau.
The hyphenated volunteers can
well afford to and will pay freight.
This movement, to throw (he Ameri
can investment interests in Mexico
solidly behind the Republican presi
dential candidate, has been under
way for months.
The Interventlon-at-any-price men
prayed that Roosevelt would be the
Republican candidate, but, despite
their disappointment at the Colonel's
defeat in the Chicago convention,
they have rallied unitedly to the sup
port of Hugheß, and will give In his
behalf ever shot in their capacious
financial locker, which is being
stocked with the object of paving the
way, if Hughes is elected, for carry
ing the flag into Mexico.
H. IJ. Wilson Aids Plan.
Some of the adroit guides of the
movement are such avowed interven
tionists as:
Henry Lane Wilson, whose con
duct as American ambassador, when
Huerta turned traitor and Madero
was murdered, earned for him inter
national notoriety.
Paul Hudson, editor of the Mexican
Herald, who is now exiled from Mex
ico. under a ban by the Carranzista
government, for advocating interven
tion in his paper.
George W. Cook, who amassed mil
lions through his monopoly as pur
veyor of supplies to the Diaz govern
ment.
Lebbeus Redman Whitley, who.
through the potency of a personal
letter of Introduction to Diaz, given
to him by William H. Taft, when
Taft was president, obtained orders
from Diat to Mexican courts, to award
blm the Bonanza mine in the state of
Oaxaca, which was In litigation.
Charles L. Seger, automobile deal
er. who was one of ex-Ambassador
Wilson's Mexico City Intimates.
James Brown Potter, who is man
ager of the British Cotton company
near Torreon, and also a close per
sonal friend of H. L. Wilson.
To TMrwt the Campaign.
The general oversight of the Mexi
can bureau of the Republican na
tional committee will be intrusted to
Cook and Hudson. Cook's energies
will be valuable chiefly In obtaining
contributions from individuals and

COAST CITIES PROTEST
FREIGHT RATE ADVANCE
New Tariffs, Based on Spokane Rate
Derision, Show Big Increases
ob All Commodities.
Increases of from 50 to 75 per cent
in rates on all freight shipments from
the East to Olympia and all Coast
points are noted in the new tariffs
just filed with the interstate com
merce commission as the result of the
decision in the Spokane rate cases, by
which the former "I. c. 1." commodity
rates are abolished, the theory of
water competition is abandoned and
coast terminals, heretofore receiving
lower rates than interior points, are
subjected to Important rate advances.
Merchants, jobbers and shippers of
all Coast cities are preparing to pro
test vigorously to the interstate com
merce commission against the new
tariffs, claiming they are not war
ranted by the decision, and reports
from Washington, D. C.. indicate the
new rates will be suspended pending
an investigation by the commission.
All commodities, such as hardware,
clothing, shoes, rubber goods, dry
goods, furniture, stationery, paper,
silks, china, paints and varnishes, and
other staple articles, are subjected to
the advance, which runs from $1 to
$1.50 per 100 pounds and in a few
cases as high as $2. Corresponding
increases are made in the rates on
shipments East from Coast points, se
riously affecting local industries.
FEW VOTERS REGISTER.
Enrollment Light in City and Country
Precincts—Books Still Open.
Light registration in all of the 23
precincts of the county as well as in
the city, where it is about half the
vote cast at the last city election, is
shown by the registration lists filed
with the secretary of state last Mon
day.
Only those whose names were In
cluded in these lists will receive
copies of the initiative pamphlet, to
be mailed out soon. The registration
books in each precinct, however, will
remain open until September 1, when
they will be closed for the primaries,
and re-opened again September 13.
They will be open then for about a
month, until finally closed October
17, 20 days before the general elec
tion.
Persons not registered by that time
cannot vote in November, but failure
to vote at the primary does not void
registration.

SLACK NOT CANDIDATE
Everett Democrat Announces He Will
Not Run for Governor.
Judge W W. Black of Everett, who
has been mentioned as a possible
candidate for the Democratic nomi
nation for governor, announced this
week that he would not be a candi
date for any office. Judge Black says
he will be ready to assist in the cam
paign in this state, not only for
Woodrow Wilson, but for the entire
state ticket.
"Although not pretending to know
the political sentiment of this state
since the national conventions,"
Judge Black said, "it seems to me,
in view of the sentiment in other
parts of the United States, that with
a vigorous and enthusiastic campaign
this state can be carried for Wilson
and at the same time we certainly
ought to elect a United States sena
tor and a majority of the congres
sional delegation as well as the en
tire state ticket.
"It is needless for me to assure
the Democrats of this state that I
will be ready to assist with all the
energy I have in the election not only
of Woodrow Wilson, but also of the
entire state and congressional ticket,
and sincerely believe that I can do
more good for my party in the ranks
than as a candidate for office."

mer resident of this city but now a
leading lumberman of the Willapa

itor this week.

local county jail in company with

Fla., two weeks ago, is due to arrive
at the Walla Walla penitentiary to

two traveling guards from that insti
tution who started with him from

Doubts cast around the identity of
the prisoner taken at Key West, by a
telegram from the authorities at
Jacksonville, Fla., saying Gillies had
escaped to South America, were re-,
moved Wednesday by a telegram from
the Key West authorities in response
to an inquiry from here, saying Gil
lies had not only been positively iden
tified but had admitted his identity,
and by a statement made to Sheriff
McCorkle by Mrs. GHlies, who said
she had received a letter from herj
husband informing her of his arrest.
The commitment papers for Gillies
were sent to Warden Drum of the

HALF MILLION DROP
IN LOCAL VALUES
BIG REDUCTION IX ASSESSMENTS
OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROP
ERTY IN COUNTY.
Reduction of more than half a mil
lion dollars in the assessed valuation
of real and personal property in
Thurston county, practically all of It
in the country districts, is reported
by Assessor J. C. Sams in the assess
ment rolls completed by him Tues
day. The decrease in real estate val
uations is $349,755 and in personal
property $174,876, a total of $524,-
631.
The total assessed valuation of the
county, exclusive of railroads, tele
graph and telephone lines, sleeping
| car companies and the Olympia Light
& Power company, which are valued
by the state tax commission, is $lO,-
474,864 this year as compared with
$10,999,495 last year, Mr. Samß says.
The reduction means a loss of ap
proximately SI,OOO in the county's
tax receipts and a corresponding re
duction in the city's revenues.
The assessment of real property in
the county, as made by Mr. Sams, to
tals $8,914,257 this year compared
with $9,264,112 last year, both made
on a 50 per cent basis. Personal
property, valued at $1,735,483 last
year, shrunk to $1,560,607 in this
year's valuation. Only about $1,300
of the reduction in real estate valua
tions occurred in Olympia, though
personal property in the city fell off
about SIIO,OOO.
Olympia's real estate is valued at
$2,400,273 in 1916 as against $2,-
401,580 in 1915, and personal prop
erty at $621,149 as against $731,044
last year; while Turn water's real
property valuation rose from $185,-
934 last year to $186,381, though
personal property fell from $76,527
to $39,875. Tenino's real estate as
sessment also increased from $134,-
156 to $138,061, personal property
values decreasing from $48,273 to
$42,102, while the valuation of real
property in Bucoda was practically
the same, $32,058 this year com
pared with $32,158 in 1915, and the
personal property assessment gained,
from $3,279 to $3,967.
1 The big portion of the reduction
ocurred, however, In the districts out
side of these municipalities, where the
' real property valuation dropped from
$6,510,184 in 1915 to $6,157,484 this
year, and personal property from sl,-
735,483 to $1,560,607.
: The principal portion of this re
duction, occurring as It does in the
districts outside the incorporated
' towns, is due to the amount of tim
ber cut from Thurston county lands.
Assessor Sams says. The SIIO,OOO
drop In personal property values in
i Olympla is due principally to the
closing of the saloons, he says, and
the depreciation in the valuation of
the Olympla Brewing company's
plant as the result of the dry law.
Assessor Sams says that Thurston
county may expect to lose in valua
tion steadily from now on, as the
result of its timber being cut off, un
less new resources are developed.
Capitol building warrants amount
ing to $30,000 were paid this week
by the state treasurer.
WHOLE NUMBER 2920
SNNN IS LASI
DAY FOR HLWGS
TWELVE COUNTY OFFICES AT
TRACT 39 CANDIDATES—WORK
ON NON-PARTISAN TICKET.
Saturday is the last day candidates
for federal, state and county posi
tions in the September primaries can
file with the secretary of state or
county auditor, and inasmuch as
there are several Republican candi
dates for governor. Democratic can
didates for various state offices, and
a Non-Partisan ticket to get into the
race, the secretary of state and
auditor will probably be quite busy
today and tomorrow. Governor Lis
ter filed for re-nomination Thursday.
Thirty-nine candidates are now on
record at the county auditor's office
as desiring nomination for some one
of the 12 county offices and all but
two of these are Republicans. Sev
eral filings during the past week have
occasioned surprise in various
circles, leading to the generally ex
pressed opinion that there is a deter
mined move in anti-organization cir
cles of the Republican ranks to test
the organization's strength in the pri
maries.
Commissioners' Jobs Popular.
Two new candidates appeared this
week for commissioner in the Second
district, making six altogether. The
new ones are Thomas C. Sleater of
Pleasant Glade, present road super
visor, and Henry Mallory of Olympia.
J. C. Sams, too, has opposition for
the nomination aB commissioner In
the First district. In the person of
John C. Ellis, a local real estate man.
The only Republican candidates
who have no primary opposition to
! date are County Auditor Annie Gas
ton, Clerk I. N. Holmes, Treasurer
Fred W. Stocking, County Superin
tendent O. C. Goss and Senator P. H.
Carlyon, and the chwew that any of
these will have opposition for the
nomination are said to be remote.
Non-Partisan Committee Busy.
County Commissioner B. F. Little-
John filed Wednesday for re-nomina
tion on the Non-Partisan ticket and
Prosecuting Attorney Geo. F. Yantls
Is expected to file today. The Non
partisan campaign committee has
been busy this week, urging various
persons to file, and has not only re
ceived encouraging reports from all
parts of the county, but expects to
have a candidate on record Saturday
for each of the county offices.
The other Republican candidates
who have filed during the past week
are J. R. Johnson of Mud Bay, a new
aspirant for assessor; Mrs. Kate L.
Young of this city for representative;
Milton Giles for Justice of the peace,
Olympia; Ray F. Wood for engineer,
and Joe Forstell for assessor.
FORECAST BIG DROP IN
1910 CROP PRODUCTION
Prospects Slump for Wheat, Oats,
Corn and Barley, August
Report Says.
Falling off In crop prospects
amounting to many millions of dol
lars' loss to farmers of the country
are indicated in the department of
agriculture's August report, which
forecasts declines in indicated produc
tion in almost every important crop
from the forecasts reported in July.
Wheat showed a loss of 105,000,-
000 bushels; corn 89,000,000 bush
els; oats 43,000,000 bushels; barley
11,000,000 bushels, and there were
decreases In rye, white and sweet po
tatoes, flax, apples and peaches.
Corn, the nation's greatest crop, is
in a serious condition from drought,
and if rain does not come soon the
yield will be smaller than the latest
forecast, which was 2,777,000,000
bushels. But the corn crop, while
89,000.000 bushels less than forecast
last month, is 45,000,000 bushels
more than the average of the preced
ing Ave years.
A wheat crop of 654,000,000 bush
els would amply meet the country's
requirements for home consumption,
which department of agriculture ex
perts estimate will be about 620,000,-
000 bushels.
