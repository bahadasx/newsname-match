fle made a dozen speeches on the
trip. Everywiiere ne stopped men
an women came out in large num
bers to hear him. It was remarked
tiiat as a public speaker he has
greatly improved since his appear
ance in Salmon two years ago, being
now indeed most forceful in all he
says before an audience. Bespeaks
in an ordinary conversational man
ner. It had been arranged that he
should appear out in the open in this
city at the'band stand, but the Govern
or found his voice was somewhat out
of condition when he arrived, so that
a change of places placed him on the !
stage :,f the opera nouse Here he
u „ , . , ,, ,
faced a good sized friendly audience. ,
The Governor was quick to otloe
the absence of the flag fro the
stage decoration and icmarked about
it, because what he had to say was
more about patriotism than politics.
Possibly half of ids hearers were not
of his own household of political
failli, for there were republicans,
progressives and socialists besides
democrats in the audience of men
and women.
Erle H. Casterlin introduced the
Governor in a ringing dozen or twen
ty words after doing the same for an
other speaker, the Rev. Mr Johns,
who had been a traveling companion
of the Governor from Mackay.
Tiie chief speaker of the evening
seldom mentioned by name the pres
ent head of tiie national government
but repeatedly typified him as carry
ing forward in achievement what
makes for the enduring glory of the
eonntry. In this connection bespoke
of tiie hanking law enacted early in
tiie days of the present national ad
ministration which not only prevents
financial panics and disturbances hut
successfully withstood the shock of
eighty-tivc millions of dollars are set
apart for building highways, which
will give to Idaho $65 non right away
for its highways, and said that very
soon under tiie operations of that law
witli the application of tiie principle
that we must first help ourselves to
better roads, there will stretch a real
highway along the Salmon rivur
through a route of matchless scenic
beauty and grandeur. There will he
other ueeded vehicle roads built, too,
under the inspiring Influence of this
law,—roads e*iy where they are so
badly needed, and they will serve a
good deal better to develop the coun
try than the piesent jerkwater rail
road you hav* here in this part of the
country, with the possibility of get
ting over tiie roads witii daily auto
mobile mail stages, too. The great
national government is behind the
good roads movement.
A few years ago It was the practice
for a community wanting the benefits
a railroad to send a delegation to
some railroad king beseeching him to
build it. You might do tbe be«eech
iug on you r knees and tlien not get
il tiie laiJrnad if the railroad kings
thought It would interrupt some
deals of their own. They locked up
the undevelcped resources of Alsaka
this way until tiie government not
long ago appropriated your money to
the amount of #36. 060,00» to constuct
Hf)( | e , iu jp y„ U r own railroad up there
The Governor had not much to s»y
about tbe achievments of his own ad
ministration further than to point
out the saving* he had la-eii enabled
make, amounting fully to what he
had claimed he would accomplish two
years ago. He said lie had vetoed a

lie had nut done more vetoing. In

As an experiment tills year a small
acreage of dry land rye was tried

early and late pasture for ihree sue

Tiiis information was ready for use
