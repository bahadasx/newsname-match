Pioneering among corporations of
11s class, the Santa Fe has launched
the bipgest agricultural development
project in the history of the west, with
Topeka as the center of operations in
Kansas and adjacent states, it was of
ficially announced today. The project
surrounds the creation of a new de
partment of agricultural demonstra
tion and development with C. L. Sea
graves, titled as industrial commis
sioner, in direct charge, under the di
rection of Edward Chambers, vice
president. While Mr. Seagravess
headquarters will be in Chicago much
of hid time will be spent in the west.
The real work, so far as Kansas and
many surrounding states are con
cerned, will be under the direction of
H M. Bainer. chief agricultural dem
onstrator, who will have offices here
In the general office building. That
was announced today by J- St. Koontz,
general freight agent.
The entire machinery of the Santa
Fe system, it is announced, will be be
hind Mr. Bainer in his work in Kan
sas, to which he will give his personal
attention. Work in other states will
probably be done by assistants under
his supervision.
Topeka the Hub.
Besides making tihs city a center of
agricultural development, the new de
partment Is expected to open the way
to make the long talked of museum
of western agricultural products, a
national attraction, in Topeka a real
ity. It is known that the officials of
the department, backed by other of
ficials of the board, will work for th
establishment of such a museum. It
is estimated such a project as has been
talked of here would cost anywhere
from $100,000 to 2500.000.
Mr. Bainer's offices here will be
closely connected with those of Frank
Jarrell, publicity agent, and will con
sist of such an office force as is need
ed. It is believed by Santa Fe offi
cials that the department will grow
into large proportions.
Mr. Bainer, whose personal attention
Kansas will receive in agricultural de
velopment and betterment, will move to
Topeka September 10 and establish
headquarters here. The work under
Mr. Bainer will be in co-operation
with the Kansas state agricultural
authorities and county farm demon
strators. Mr. Bainer plans to give the policy
of running demonstration trains a new
impetus with the inauguration of the
new department.
Will Interest Women.
Those trains will demonstrate and
advocate development in the aeiry
business, poultry business, improved
seeds and eventually, through the co
operation of farm wives, the running
of demonstration trains showing ivhat
could be accomplished in the direction
of Improved farm life and conditions.
"This latter work holds out many
possibilities." Mr. Koontz said today,
"and a Santa Fe train thru Kansas,
showing miniature farm houses with
all the facilities and improvements en
Joyed i.i modern city residences will
unquestionably be the order of the
day. That will not only arouse en
thusiasm for rural development but it
will arouse competition for the bet
terment of rural districts.
"Mr. Bainer has a national reputa
tion as an agricultural demonstrator,
and his well organized forces or-? un
doubtedly going to attract national at
tention to Kansas and the west. The
Santa Fe is going to back up Mr.
Bainer In every plan that he may
launch that has for its purpose an
increased industrial and farm aevel
opment in Kansas."
President Ripley, who is the father
of the idea, in a recent interview in
Chicago, stated that there li every
1vJi;f!cation for the belief that with
co-operation assured, there will be.
thru the medium of improved se?ds,
and the help of the agricultural col
lege authorities, in the matter of in
tensified farming, a materially in
creased yield per acre in the products
of Kansas.
Ask Help of I. C. C.
Steps of sweeping importance are
planned by the road in Kansas under
the developmental department. The
Santa Fe. with several other roads, is
negotiating with the interstate com
merce commission, to place into effect
low rates on ground limestone for use
in fertilization and thereby encourage
its importation into this state and
other states. .
"Efforts," said Mr. Koontz, "will b
mid to improve farm methods and
farm seeds. The department, it is
planned, will take immediate steps to
improve ine quality of seeds. Our Red
Turkey wheat, for instance, needs new
lire injected into It. fhe dpartment

TOO MANY WOMEN, GIRLS
BOOZING SAYS RESOLUTION
Washington, Aug. 11. The Cath
olic Total Abstinence Union of
America waa on record today In
opposition to the growing use of
intoxicants by women and girls.
Resolutions to that effect were
adopted and officers were elected,
headed by the Rev. John G. Bean
of Pittsburg, at the closing session
of the union last night.
to Canada and then return it after It
has been given a stronger and renewed
life by the transfer."
It is planned by the road to make
the campaign reach every needed
place in Kansas.
"Mr. Bainer." Mr. Koontz said, "Is
a man of unusual ability as he has
proven himself. He is a man who puts
practical methods to work in a prac
tical way and he expounds no theories
without having proven them."
To Co-operate With State.
The Santa Fe department will also
be in close co-operation with the state
department of agriculture. In fact,
Santa Fe officials announce, the heads
of the department will co-operate with
all worthy movements and institutions
making an effort to build up the state
agriculturally and industrially.
Among the features of Mr. Bainer's
campaign in Kansas will be special
improvement trains of instruction
where needed. Practical men will be
engaged by him to aid in the move
ment. No effort will be spared to
drive home the campaign in a ma
terial way.
The Santa Fe's new plan is the first
project of its kind that has ever been
launched by a railroad or corporation,
as far as its widesweeping effect upon
the development of so large a territory
is concerned. Its progress will be
watched closely by other lines which
have been attempting to start some
thing of the kind on a smaller scale.
Efforts will be put forth by the men
behind the affair to bring conventions
from all over the west to this city.
Modern machinery in agricultural op
erations will be advocated. Men be
hird the project say no particular
make of machinery or modern farm
improvements will be advocated, but
the idea will be to place power and
enthusiasm behind a blanket campaign
of progress.

Successful attacks by German air

Sends Wireless But Keeps Secret
Identity May Be Bremen.
New York, Aug. 11. Wireless ob
servers at shore stations near New
York were puzzled early today by
signals received from an unidentified
vessel somewhere off Sandy Hook
which was calling the Tellefunken
wireless station in this city. The fact
that the stranger refused to disclose
the identity of the vessel led some of
the wireless operators to believe they
were at last in communication with
long expected German submarine Bre
men. While in communication with the
shore stations a few hours earlier the
strange vessel reported herself only as
a collier and the operator on board
signed his calls "D. B. U.," which is
the private wireless signal of the
North German Lloyd steamer Breslau,

NO MORE "A LA"
ON MENU CARDS
IN GOOD OLD U. S.
New York. Aug. 11. Winding up
their three-day convention here with a
dinner at the Waldorf, members of
the International Stewards' association
declared their independence of "a la"
and other foreign tyrants of th menu
card.
"Let us shake off this foreign yoke
that sa demeans us." demanded E. H.
Nies, "creating instead an American
system. Let our hotel press show the
world that we are able to run our ho
tels without foreign help or language."
With one accord and a French-German-Swiss
accent, the 300 stewards
cheered the idea and voted for sim
plicity in menus.
GIVE MEDIATORS
24 HOURS MORE
TO STOP STRIKE
Brotherhoods Serve Notice on
Board Today.
After Day's Deliberation, No
Progress Is Apparent.
WILL PRESIDENT WILSON ACT?
Question Whether Anything
Farther Can Be Done.
Washington Gets Tip That ISo
Strike Will Be Called.
New York, Aug. 11. The federal
board of mediation and conciliation
has only until tomorrow to present its
final proposition intended to avert &
strike of 400,000 railroad men on 326
railroads of the United States. The
big four brotherhoods served this no
tice on the board this afternoon.
New York, Aug. 11. After deliber
ating the greater part of the' night the
United States board of mediation and
conciliation was today no nearer a so
lution of the deadlock In the dispute
between the four railroad brother
hoods of the country and their em
ployes. The efforts of the mediators to avert
a strike was virtually at a halt, due to
the fact, it was reported, that the rail
roads refuse to grant any concession
than arbitration while the men persist
in their stand for the unequivocal
granting of their demands for an
eight-hour day and time and a half for
overtime. A formal request for a
twenty-four hour delay in the nego
tiations was made by the board to the
union men today when they assembled
to receive the mediators, and it was
reported that the boaxd, unless there
was an unexpected change in the sit
uation in that time, would suggest to
President Wilson that he intervene,
like Stick of Dynamite.
Commissioner Hanger said the
board expected to continue delibera
tions today and might reach a "deci
sion by evening as to the time of the
next meeting with one or the other
side.
"We do not intend," said W. E. Stone,
Chief of the Brotherhood of Engineers,
"to wait very long on the- mediators.
The temperament of the men Is such
that they would not have waited a
j minute if we had not persuaded them
to give the mediators a chance. Per
sonally I do not care to' carry the
strike vote around in my pocket for
any extended period. It is like a stick
of dynamite.
"Since its organization in 1913,
thru an act of congress and up to
September 20, 1915, the board has sat
on forty-seven controversies between
railroads and their employes. In ev
ery instance the board has succeeded
in securing an ultimate adjustment of
the differences, thirty-nine cases hav
ing been settled by mediation alone
and eight by arbitration."
When asked whether he thought an
attempt would be made to arbitrate
the difficulties, Stone shook his head
and said:
Can It Be Taken Further?
"The members of the United .States
Board of Mediation and Conciliation
are the personal representatives of
President Wilson and that fact car-
j ries with it considerable weight; just
now mucn remains to oe seen, xx cms
board is unable to reach some settle
ment. It is doubtful whether any other
board or commission can do so."
G. W. W. Hangar, one of the mem
bers of the federal board, presented
some proposition of a secret character
to the employes today. He returned
later to a meeting of the mediators.
When asked what the program was
now he replied he did not know.
"We are now making our plans
hour by hour." he said. "We are
hopeful but I can't predict what is go
ing to happen. I can't say anything
more."
While the mediators were meeting
during the morning the employes held
another secret session.
Arbitration Next Step.
Washington, Aug. 11. In adminis
tration circles here the greatest con-
t fldence was expressed that there will
j be no national strike of railroad era-
ployes and that if mediation falls, the
I four great brotherhoods and the com
! mittee of railroad managers will agree
i to arbitration.
i President Wilson is being kept fully
! informed by Commissioner W. L.
Chambers, of the federal board of me
i diation and conciliation, of all devel-
opments in the situation and is ready
j to act personally if the situation
i should warrant executive intervention
j to prevent a strike.
An appeal to prevent a strike will be
presented to the president tomorrow
by Robert T. Frazier, an employe of
the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis
railway, who claims to represent 80
per cent of the railroad employes of
f e United States and who, he says,
are not affiliated with the four broth
erhoods and are opposed to a 3trike.
Mr. Frazier brought with him to
WfiHhlnfrtnn n. netiiion to pnncmiaa a air
ling legislative action to prevent the
1 threatened strike.
OUTLINE NEW DEMANDS
Revised Schedules, Shorter Hours,
More Pay, Sought by Carmen.
New York, Aug. 11. A draft of de
mands to be made upon the New York
Railways company by its conductors
i and motormen has been drawn up and
! will be submitted probably within a
! few days. It calls a sweeping revision
of operating schedules, shorter and
: more uniform working hours and a
wage scale of 30 to S3 cents an hour.
The men now are paid 26 to 30 cents
, an hour.
Schedules in force in Boston, Chi
cago, Pittsburg and other cities where
working conditions are said to be bet-
i ter than in New York, furnished the
I basis for the demands.

Wall Street Candidate.
Answers Charges Made in
Hughes' Recent Speeches.
CITES RECORD AS GOVERNOR
Alleges He Catered to Plutocrat
and "Piunder-hund."
Defends Handling of "Plums'
to Democrat Workers.
Kansas City. Aug. 11. William
Jennings Bryan, former secretary of
state, in a written statement given out
here today replying to attacks made
upon' him and the Democratic party
by Charles E. Hughes charged the
Republican presidential nominee with
being supported by "trust magnates.
Wall street and the railroads" who
are "seeking to put him in a position
to safeguard plutocracy from further
attacks." Mr. Bryan's arraignment
came as an answer to Mr. Hughes's
recent speeches concerning the ex
secretary's attitude toward the civil
service.
He said he "had enforced the civil
service law to the lettter." Mr. Bryan
challenged the Republican nominee to
state whether he- had given appoint
ments to "deserving Republicans"
while governor of New York.
The statement was made in answer
to recent speeches of Mr.- .-Hughes
which quoted a letter Bryan had writ
ten to Receiver of Customs Vick in
Santo Domingo inquiring as to what
positions could be obtained to "reward
deserving Democrats." Mr. Bryan ad
mitted the letter as it had been quoted.
Not Ashamed of Record.
"I am not ashamed of it," the state
ment read. "The letter was written to
an appointive officer, whose office was
not under the civil service and the in
quiry was made in regard to offices
which were not under the civil service.
"There was nothing to the letter to
indicate a desire or intention to select
men who are incompetent. On the
contrary inquiry is made as to 'what
is requisite.' "
The statement after declaring Mr.
Hushes to have "shown himself quite
prompt in discharging obligation!
"As an official. I enforced the civil
service law to the letter and upon my
resignation received from the em
ployes in the state department more
than 90 per cent of whom were under
the civil service, a watch which I
prize as a pricele treasure. But,
while I observed the civil service law,
wherever it was in force, I felt myself
free to aid in rewarding deserving
Democrats whereve it could be done
without detriment to the service. My
regret is that I was able to reward
so few of the multitude who are de
serving, measured by their political
service, by their capacity and by their
fitness for the work to be done.
As Good as Deserving Republican.
"The 'deserving Democrat' is not to
be despised he is as much entitled to
recognition as a 'deserving Republi
can.' "When he was a candidate for gov
ernor, Mr. Hughes received the sup-
j port of the railroads of New York and
he generously repaid the debt by veto
ing the two-cent passenger rate bill.
He did not describe that as shameful.
When a candidate for governor he re
ceived the support of the New York
tax dodgers, the owners of 'swollen
fortunes' and he paid his debt by
sending a message to the legislature
protesting against the income tax
amendment to the federal constitution.
He does not describe that as shame
ful. "He is now being supported by the
ra.llrna.fiH of the TTniteH Rtnt.. unH h
I expects to pay them back by aiding
! them to escape state legislation and
j find a haven of security in 'exclusive
j federal control' over the railroads. He
I is being supported by the shipping
trust and expects to pay them back
j by helping them to prevent govern-
ment competition. He is supported by
the trust magnates and expects to pay
I them back by shielding them from
j punishment for the extortion which
which they desire to practice; he is
supported by Wall street and expects
I to pay them back by spending Ameri
J can blood and squandering money
j raised by taxation in order to euaran
jtee profits on speculative investments.
!And yet, with the record which he has
! made in paying his political obliga
tions at the expense of the public and
with the pledges his speeches contain
to those who are now aiding his am
bitions, he has the impudence to hold
up for criticism a legitimate effort to
reward competent men for the service
which they have rendered to the cause
of reform.
A Twenty Year Struggle.
"For twenty years the people have
been engaged in a life and death
struggle to save the nation from the
big exploiters, the big grafters and the
big 'pork' hunters from the plunder
bund to which Mr. Hughes is inuebted
for all the political honors he has en
joyed and which is now seeking to put
him in a position to safeguard pultoc
racy from further attacks. Mr. Hughes
! is perfectly familiar with the contest
! because he has been conspicuous
' among the diampions of the plunder
- bund.
I "In the campaign of 1908 he was
put forth as the chief representative
of the trusts and his eloquent advocacy
of their cause won him a place on the
supreme bench where he had been
quick to show his bias in their favor.
"But while he has been winning
valuable rewards as Republican who
is 'deserving' from the standpoint of
the predatory intersts, the plain, com
mon people have been waging a brave
and continuous struggle for the rescue
i of their government from the hands
' of Mr. Hughes's political friends and
supporters. They have won battle
after battle.
"They have secured, without Mr.
Hughes's aid the election of senators

Minimum Charge For Gas Has
v Been Reduced.
Kansas Natural Represent
atives Meet at St. Joe
Minimum charges for natural gas
will be reduced to 50 cents, according
to announcement made by Kansas
Natural Gas company representatives
at a meeting In St. Joseph, Mo. - Dis
pute concerning a 85. cent or 32 cent
flat rate will be discussed at a meet
ing to be held next Tuesday In Pitts
burg, Pa.
Concessions were made by the gas
company in the matter of a minimum
rate when S. M. Brewster, attorney
general, declared the burden of the
gas rate increase would fall most heav
ily on the persons least able to meet
the advance. The gas company, how
ever, refused to reduce the flat Tate
and unless their decision is overruled
next week, the flat rate will stand at
85 cents. Only court action can
change the rate if the gas company
refuse to make further reductions.
Favor Poorer Classes.
Representatives of the gas company
stated that the minimum charge was
reduced in order to take the burden
of expense from the poorer classes.
Operating expenses and the high cost
of gas compel the 35 cent flat rate,
they declared. It is because of the

"They have won, in spite of Mr.
Hughes's opposition the income tax

has made it possible to transfer a con
siderable part of the burden of taxa

They have secured a reduction of the
tariff and a measure of relief from
the exactions of the trusts. They have
secured currency reform, a rural
credit law, a child labor law and other
measures of justice at great sacrifice

timidation, coercion and ostracism.
They have shown a moral courage and
a devotion worthy of the great cause
in which they have enlisted.
"I receled the support of nearly six

GET 15,000 OF GARRISON
36,000 Prisoners Include Those
Taken Before City Fell.
Austrian Reserves Were Rush
ed to Goritz Too Late.
Rome, Aug. 11. The Austrians lost
more than 60,000 in killed, wounded
and prisoners In the two days of
fighting that preceded the fall of Gor
itz according to dispatches received
here today. This number was equally
divided between prisoners and casual
ties on the field. East of Goritz, Ital
ian cavalry continues to press the pur
suit of the retreating Austrians and
is now reported to have reached the
Lubiana plains. -
The Italian force that turned south
from Goritz to drive the enemy out of
the bend of the Isonzo has encoun
tered most stubborn resistance on the
Carso Plateau, where severe fighting
is going on- Th main bwly of Ital
ians that crossed the Isonzo appar
ently has not yet Joined in the pur
suit. All dispatches from the Goritz
front declare that only a part of
General Cadorna's troops on that sec
tor are now engaged with the retreat
ing Austrians.
Austrian prisoners report that the
Italian blow at Goritz came as a com
plete surprise. Their commanders be
lieved that the Italian Isonzo front
had been stripped of both men and
munition supplies to repel the Aus
trians In the Trentino and anticipated
no attack against Goritz for at least
two months
Reserves were rushed up to the
Goritz positions Sunday night after
the Italian attack began. They found
the advanced Austrian positions blown
to pieces and the Italians pouring
through numerous breaches in the
Austrian line.
Clear Valley of Fleeing Enemy.
Rome. Aug. 11. The number of
nrisonera taken by the Italians since
the fall of Goritz now exceeds 15,00
according to the correspondent of the
Trlbuna. On the Isonzo front ItaliRn
cavalry -and cyclists are clearing the
valleys of the retreating Austrians
and according to the . correspondent
the battle continues In favor of the
Italians on both wings. - Including the
21,000 captured before city fell, the
Italians now hold S6.000 prisoners.
Austrians Re-forming Front.
Rome, Aug. 11. The importance of
the Italian successes-around Goritz
(Gorizla) is becoming more evident
hourly. The battle is continuing be
hind the city over a front about
twelve miles long. The Austrians
have retreated along the railroad In
the direction of Dornberg, eight miles
southeast of Goritz and over the na
tional highway to Schon pass six miles
to the east and are now attempting to
reform their front on a line extending
from Vipacco to Tamova.
Meanwhile the Austrians are at
tempting to take the offensive st
Monte Nero and various other points
of the Italian front but thus far have
been unable to divert the Italians
from their operations behind Goritz.
King Gets Congratulations.
Popular enthusiasm is at high pitch
thruout Italy. Congratulations are
pouring in from all parts of the world
to King Victor Emmanuel and Gen
eral Cadorna.
The third army under command of
the Duke of Aosta. which is still bear
ing the brunt of the fighting has
won high praise as well as much sym
pathy on account of Its losses. The
duke, before the battle began, called
on his army to fight and win, "In the
name of your mothers, your wives,
your sisters and your country."

HUGHES HOARSE
BUT MAKES NINE v
SPEECHES TODAY
Under Constant Treatment by
Campaign Physician.
Winds Up Strenuous Day With
Billings Speech Tonight.
MRS. HUGHES SHUNS STAGE
Declares Hereafter Shell Sit in
Audience to Hear Better. '
Has So Maid So Presidential
Candidate Buttons Dresses.
Bismarck, N. D.. Aug. 11. With his
voice pretty well frazzled out Presi
dential Candidate Hughes today faced
what was probably the busiest day
scheduled on his whole transconti
nental trip.
He had eight "end of the train"
speeches in North Dakota and Mon
tana, before arriving In Billings to
night for one of his "big speecheo."
Talks were here. Mandan, Dickinson,
Medora. Beach, Glendive, Forsyth and
Miles City.
Because of the strenuoslty of this
program the Republican candidate
went on training schedule today. Hl
voice, accustomed for the past few
years to the conversational tone of the
supreme court, will have to be coddled
along very carefully from now on if he
is to finish the speaking schedule
ahead of him during the next four
weeks.
Sprays to Strengthen Throat.
Dr. T. E. Ditman, his physician and
physical adviser on this tour, is assid
uously spraying the candidate's strained
vocal chords several times each day.
Hughes is following a suggestion
which former Senator Chauncey M.
Depew made to him at the time ha
stumped New York on the anti-race
track bills, not to talk on the train,
saving even conversation, as far as
possible, since It always strains the
voice to try to talk loud enough to be
heard on a moving train.
Hughes Is also taking care with his
diet and is particularly strong on fruit.
His favorite breakfast fruit is orange
and always before he retires, he drinks
the Juice of one or two oranges. The
nominee's voice was yery hflftroft trAfr
and it is an apparent ifort for him to
talk.
.-, Mrs. Bnghes Starts Reto-nton. '
Mrs. Hughes led a gentle rebellion
today. Heretofore local committees
have been anxious to have her sit on
the platform beside her campaigning
husband but from now on the gov
ernor's helpmate will sit in the audi
ence. .
"I want to be where I can hear my
husband and see him when he speaks,"
she told Laurence H. Green, the gov
ernor's secretary, who is looking out
for her comfort on the trip. - Mrs.
Hughes Is taking no maid so her hus
band, the Republican presidential can
didate. Is buttoning dresses up the
back.
Mrs. Hughes seems to be standing
the fatigue of the trip splendidly al
tho she misses no opportunity to take
a walk. Hughes sprang a new hat to
day. Half an hour after he had donned
it there waa a gaping hole in the
crown. The governor purchased tho
new "kelly," which la a brown fedora
with a slightly curled up brim. In
Chicago and some Jealous local com
mitteeman yanked It down too hard
on the hook today, causing the hole.
Hughes's Fargo Speech.
Fargo, N. D., Aug. 11. "I'd like to
have the authority to investigate for
about six montha."
Charlea E. Hughes, whoae political
career is founded upon hla investiga
tion of the Ineurance companlea of
New York, last night fervently ex
pressed this desire In winding up a
renewed charge that the Wilson ad
ministration has used public office for
political purposes.
"It is scandalous," the Republican
nominee shouted, huskily, while 2,006
people in the Auditorium here accord
ed him a round of applause.
Winding up the first day of his en
try Into the agricultural northwest.
Hughes resumed his pounding of Mr.
Wilson and his administration for al
leged incompetency. Earlier in the
day at Grand Forks he addressed an
other meeting composed largely of
farmers, at which he discussed agri
culture, tariff and prcparednuess.
A significant feature of the day's
events was the presence of Lynn J.
Frazier. gubernatorial candidate of the
Farmers Non-partisan league of
North Dakota, on the platform as pre
siding officer of the Grand Forks
meeting.
The Farmers" Non-partisan league
has Indisputably political control of
the state. Its endorsement is tanta
mount to carrying the state. No of
ficial action has yet been taken by
the league, but It Is recognized here
the league's vote will go solidly to
Hughea.
Frazier said:
Carry Dakota by 2,X.H) .
"I don't think there Is any doubt but
that Hughes will carry North Dakota,
by at least 2,000 plurality. Out hero
