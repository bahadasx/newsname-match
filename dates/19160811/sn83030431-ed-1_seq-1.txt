The conference scheduled for to-morrow
is alrrody being derided as a Joke.
The delegates arc not In any doubt as to
tho small figure It will cut In tho selec

Kverybody is wondering why he
should want the nomination, for If
Samuel Untermyer wouldn't take It, they
say It Is pretty good evidence that
Wilson will run so poorly In this
Htate as to make a Henate nomination
worthless. The disposition among the
Tammany leaders Is to assume that
Untermyer knew when to quit.
There Is some talk of naming William
F, McCombs, formerly national chair

WICKS MORE OPTIMISTIC
Dnir.vmen Arrange to Take
Lesson in Method of Con
ducting Strike,
Senulor Charlts W. WlcUa expressed
the opinion Inst night that a way would
be found to avert the threatened strike
of milk producers with Its attendant
train of hardships and dangers to the
children of New York city. N. Ilallock
vice-president of the IJorden Milk Com-
pany, also predicted that there would
be no strike and Intimated strongly that
his company would pay the farmers
more, beginning In September.
Hut the dairymen who appeared as
wltnesaea before Senator Wlcka'a com
mittee In Syracuse yesterday adhered to
the belief that they must have more
money or quit the business, and the
State Dairymen's League has arranged
to hear an address from the man who
conducted the successful milk strike In
Chicago, when the gutter- of that city

the New York State dairymen hope to
get useful hints on how to proceed.
Wlrka Optimistic.
Senator Wicks was In Albany last
night, after the day's work at Syracuse,
and was in n cheerful frume of mind.
He believes the revelations his com
mittee has obtained from witnesses will
bring about an Improvement In condi
tions which will make tho strike un
I necessary. The hearings to-day will be
held In Oswego.
Mr. Ilallock discussed the situation
i from the point of view of the dlstrlbu

HARDEN'S ATTACK ON RULERS
STOPPED THE
Outspoken Allele Charged That the German Govern
ment Had No Excuse for Beginning
the War.
.Saiui. little Iteipaick lo ThsSc.
London, Aus. 10. Word has been re
ceived here that what caused the sup
pression of the Berlin Tapebfall on
August l was an article by Maximilian
Harden, editor of Ule Zukunft, who has
written muoh frank criticism of Ger
many's conduct of the war.
All the copies of the objectionable Is
suo of the rapefclatf that were mailed
abroad have been stopped by the der
man Government, but the correspondent
of Tmt-Hl'.v haa been able to get a copy.
Harilcn'a article rays that the German
Government never should have declared
war without consulting the Reichstag.
A translation of part of Harden' article
follows :
"Declarations that this wur waa an
Inevitable war, that Ocrmnny was forced
Into it all unprepared and nKnlnst her
will cannot be supported except by ex
tremist partisans. Undoubtedly the
conflict could have been avoided had the
Government desired to avoid It.
"Undoubtedly too it would have been
avoided had the Kelohstag been tuken
Into the confidence of our rulers Instead
of being presented merely with a recital
of actions taken Independently of It.
