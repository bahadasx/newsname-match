The Interest Rate Paid by the
Borrower.
. No Federal land bank is per
mitted to charge more than 6
percent per annum on its farm
mor(fffJe loans, and in no case
shall tlio interest charged on
farm mortgages exceed by flloi e
than 1 per cent the rate paid on
the last issue of bonds.
For example, if the bank pays
only 4 per cent on an issue of
ttondyjt can not charge more
than 6 pe? en4 for the next
farm loans it makes.
Out of this margin of not to
exceed 1 par cent, togetder with
such amounts as it can earn on
its paid-in cash capital, the bank
must bet aside certain reserves
and meet all is expenses. Any
balah'f'e or net profits can be
distributed as dividoads to the
loan associations or othef stock
holders. Thtj loan associations,
from .their bank dividends, aft
er Setting aside the required re
serves and nie'e'titig expenses,
can declare association dividends
t their members. In this way
the profits, if any, will lie dis
tributed among the borrowers
knd will, to that extent, reduce
the anfiount of interest actually
paid by thYrt.

semi-annual paym-mta, which
include not only all interest and
charges due the bank, but the'
principal as well. These pay
ments are so calculated as to
extinguish the debt in a givei
number of years. After fiv
years the borrower has the
fight on any interest date to
make additional payments on
the principal in sums of 25 or
any multiple hereof, thus dis
charging the debt more quickly.
The table given below ilnis-
trates how a loan of $l',00flr,
bearing interest at 5 per cent,
would be retired in 20 years Jby
an annual payment of $S').2-1.
A study of the columns shows
how from year to year thd int

tion of the payment which
goes to discharge tht? principal
steadily increases. Tin final

After a Federal land bank has
loaned on first mortgage $50,-
000. it can obtain n-irmission
from the Farm Loan Board to
issue .50,000 in farm loan bonds
based on these mortgages, sell
such bonds in the open" market,
and use the money thus obtain
ed t' lend on other mortgages'.
This process of lending on
moitgagea and selling bonds in
issues of $;50,000 ma' be repeat
ed until bonds to the amount of
twenty times the bank's paid
up capital are outstanding. If
each bank should have only its'
required minimum paid-up cap
ital of $750,000, this plan will
provide eventually, if all Dm
authorized bonds of the 12 banks
are sold, over ?180,000,(XK) to
lend on first mortgages on farm
land. The banks' however, can
increase their capital stock
the required minimum and so
increase the amount of bonds
they can sell, and thus increase
the total amount of money avail
able for loans on faim mortg
ages. To make these bonds attract
ive to investors, the bonds, to
gether with the mortgages up
on which they are based, ave ex
empted from federal, State, mu
nicipal, and local taxation and
are made legal investments for
fiduciary and trust funds. The
capital stock of the Federal land
banks is also exempt from tax
ation. Federal resurve hanks
and member banks of that sys
tem are en powered to buy and
selt these bonds. They are to
bo issued in denominations of
$20, $50, 100, and $1000.
