WASHINGTON,- Aug. 11.—There
wil] be no serious shortage in the
wheat crop.—Department of Agricul
ture.
If there is any unwarranted rise in
the price of flour, we will get busy.—
Federal Trade Commission.
Experts of government departments
thus united today in saying that there
is no need to fear because of the small
wheat cr6p expected this year. Bven
if there were a serious shortage—if
not a bushel of wheat* were harvested
—this nation would live, as one offi
cial said, "on the fat of the land."
Two government departments said
they are ready to meet any manipula
tion-of wheat or flour—the department
of justice and the federal trade com
mission. Congress probably also
would be involved—as in the present
gasoline investigation. "If we find
evidence of unfair methods and price
boosting, either by complaint to us
or by our own commission, we shall
get busy," said Commissioner Davids
of the federal trade commission.
The wheat crop this year is expect
ed to be C54.000.000 bushels. On this
bisls of 5.3 bushels per capita a year
—the average consumption—with 75,
000,000 bushels required for seed, the
requirement would be about 620,000,
000 bushels. This would leave thirty
four million bushels for export.
012,000,000 bushels. About
250,OQO,000 bushels were exported
l*he year before 333,000,000 bushels
went abroad, but the "ve year average
is only 125,000,000 bushels. Experts
predict that as Europe accustoms her
self to the war, the demand upon this
country will be less pressing..
The 34,000,000 export margin this
year has excited speculators, the de
partment men said, pausing them to
forget that 75,000,000 bushels of last
year's crop are left in the hands of
farmers who were unable to dispose
of it and 75,000,000 bushels more are
in elevators and warehouses.
Ask Embargo on Wheat.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.—Declar
ing that unless congress acts, the
price of bread surely will advance
beyond the reach of the average
consumer, the National Association
of Master Bakers today petitioned
the house and senate to impose an
embargo on wheat.
At the same time it was announced
at the office of the federal trade
commission that Vice Chairman Hur
ley who left for Chicago last night,
had gone armed with authority to in
vestigate the proposed increase in
bread prices, agreed to by the Mast
er Bakers' association.
"The advance in the" price of wheat
fifty per cent within thirty days, is
largely due to the war in Europe,"
said the master bakers' petition.
"It certainly Is the part of wis
dom to conserve such wheat supplies
as we have. If no relief is afforded
by the proper authorities, there will
inevitably be a considerable increase
in the coet of bread.
"In the name of 40,000,000 users of
bakers' bread, we ask an embargo
thrown about the present supply so
effective as to prevent any further
advance."
The petitions were referred to com
mittees without actionn.

BISMARK, N. D., Aug. 11.—With
his voice pretty frazzled out, Presi
dential Candidate Hughes today faced
what was probably the busiest day
scheduled on his whole trans-contin
ental trip.
He had eight "end of the train"
speeches in North (Dakota and Mon
I tana towns before arriving in Bill
I ings tonight for one of his "big
speeches." Talks were here, Mandan,
Dickinson, Medora, Beach, Glendive,
Forsyth, and Miles City.
Because of the strenuosity of this
program the republican candidate
went on training schedule today.
His voice accustomed for the past
few years to the conversational tone
of the supreme bench, will have to be
coddled along very carefully from
now on if he is to finish the speak
ing schedule ahead of him during the
next four weeks.
Dr. D. E. Ditman, his physician
and physloal advisor on this tour, is
assidously spraying the candidate's
strained vocal chords several times
each. day. Governor {Hughes is fol
lowing a suggestion which former
Senator Chauncey M. Depew made to
him at the time he stumped New
York on the anti-track bills, not to
talk on the train, saving even in con
versation, as far as poss£ble, since it
always strains the voice to try to
talk loud enough to be heard on a
moving train.
Hughes is also taking exceeding
care with his diet and is particularly
strong on fruit. His favorite break
fast fruit is orange and always be
fore he retires, he drinks the Juice
of one or two oranges. The nom
inee's voice was very hoarse today
and it Is an apparent effort for him
to talk.
Mrs. 'Hughes led a gentle rebellion
today. Heretofore local committees
have been anxious to have her sit on
the platform beside her campaigning
husband, but from now on the gov
ernor's helpmate will sit in the aud
ience.
"I want to be where I can hear my
husband and see him when he
speaks," she told Laurence H. Green,
the governor's secretary, who is look
ing out for her comfort on the trip.
Mrs. Hughes is taking no maid, so
her husband, the republican presi
dential candidate, is buttoning dresses
,up the back.
Mrs. Hughes seems to be standing
the fatigue of the trip splendidly, al
though she misses no opportunity to
take a walk. Hughes sprang a new
hat today. Half an hour after he had
donned it there was a gaping hole in
the crown. The governor purchased
the new Kelly which is a ibrown
fedora with a slightly curled up brim,
in Chicago, and some Jealous local
committeeman yanked it down too
hard on the hook today, causing the
hole.
The candidate and Mrs. Hughes
ate real home cooked bread today.
Mrs. Rose E. Upton Bascom of Fargo
baked it of original Dakota wheat
and sent it to Mrs. Hughes last night.

'ROME, Aug. 11.—The Austrlans lost
more than fifty thousand in killed,

Their commanders believed that
the Italian Isonzo front had been

Terntino and anticipated no attack
against Goritz for at least two
months.
Reserves were rushed up to the

TOPEKA, Kans., Aug. 11.—This
state's "fighting woman," Dr. Efva

in her race for the democratic con

"I believe Corwine has been nomi

I am not ready to admit my defeat,
until the official count is made Tues
day. The vote is too close for me to
be beaten unofficially. Corwine claims
the nomination by 192 votes."
The Kansas sufragettes believes
if she has failed to get the nomina

of the male voters.
If Rev. H. J. Corwine, Dr. Harding's
opponent, has won, she will support

Although Matter la In Process of Ar

Strike is Not
Pasaed.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.—The possi
bilities of a nation-wide railroad strike
affecting 400,000 employes and tieing
up more than 230,000 miles of rail
ways, loomed nearer today unless a
settlement is quirkly reached, when
Warren S. Stone, grand chief of the
(Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
declared the men are growing more
and more restless.
"We must have immediate action,"
said Stone. "Carrying
a
strike vote
around in your pocket is like carrying
a stick of dynamite. You can never
tell what is going to happen. This
controversy has dragged along so that
our men are grwing impatient. If It
had not been for the earnest plea of
the brotherhood presidents, this con
troversy would not have been submit
ted to the mediators. But our plea to
give the government officers a chance
to see what they could do, finally pre
vailed."
When asked whether he thought an
attempt would be made to arbitrate
the difficulties, Stone shook his head
and said:
"The members of the United States
board of mediation and conciliation
are the personal representatives of
President Wilson and that fact carries
with it considerable weight Just how
much, remains to be seen. If this
board is unable to reach some settle
ment It is doubtfull whether any oth
er board or commission could do so."
G. W. W. Hangar, one of the mem
bers of the federal board, presented
some proposition of a secret character
to the employes today. He returned
later to a meeting of the mediators.
When asked what the program was
now, he replied he did not know.
"We are maKlng our plans hour by
hour," he said. "We are hopeful but
I can't predict what is going to hap
pen. I can't say anything more."
While the mediators were meeting
during the morning, the employes held
another secret session. They will
await further word from the federal
board.
Report Tomorrow.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.—The federal
board of mediation and conciliation
and representatives of trainmen's bro
therhoods, including 400,000 railroad
men of the country, today agreed to
delay submitting any final proposi
tion looking toward a settlement of
demands made by the men until Sat
urday morning at 10 o'clock.
Following several conferences held
during the morning, President Stone
of the engineers brotherhood indi
cated strongly that prompt action
must be taken by the board, but mem
bers of the board declared they were
not ready to report at present.
Mediator G. W. W. Hangar then an
nounced that postponement of submis
sion of any immediate proposition he
granted.
We ask that we be given until 10
o'clock tomorrow morning to make our
report, Hangar said.
Upon the brotherhood representa
tives agreeing to this, President Gar
retson of the conductors declared
there was nothing to do now but wait
for the decision tomorrow.
