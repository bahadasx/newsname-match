WOODLAND WINS
IN CLOSE GAME
By the close score of 7 to 6, Wood
land defeated the St. Helens base
ball club Sunday. The game was
played on the Woodland grounds,
and there was a large attendance.
Virgil Stevens pitched for St. Helens
and gave a good account of himself
as a moundsman, striking out 12 of
the Woodlandites and issuing trans
portation to only one man. Kees
Hall did tlio receiving, and lived up
to his reputation as a catcher. All of
tho St. Helens players charge their
defeat to a wrong decision of the
umpire. In the eighth' Inning, when
St. Helens was leading, two Wood
land players were on the bags and
two down when the batsman poled
out a long foul over first base. The
umpire called It a fair ball and two
men scored. St. Helens was in the
lead in the ninth but Woodland an
nexed one tally, Just enough to tie
the score, so the game had to go ten
Innings. St. Helens could do noth
ing in their half of this frame, but
Woodland" was more fortunate and
one of her players knocked a long
single into the tall grass In right
fiold, where the little pellet became
lost Just long enough to allow the
fleet footed Woodlandito to scamper
home with the winning run.
Tho St. Helens team was composed
entirely of home boys, and they
played good ball. Manager Stevens
has not as yet arranged for a game
for the coming Sunday, but In all
probability there will be a game .
on the Sunday following. Stevens
says his policy will ho to play Just
home boys and thinks this will be
more Interesting to the fans.

LIKELIHOOD OF
SOME PAVEMENT
The property owners on that por
tion of Columbia street between St.
Helens and Cowlitz streets are un
derstood to be In favor of some kind
of hard surface pavement. The "RJch-
mondite," which is to be used on
the rond between Scuppooso and the
Multnomah county lino is being
given consideration and It Is likely
that this will be used. Another plun
proposed to improve this street,
it is estimated that the street can be
scarified and rolled and then a dress
ing of screening placed on It before
a coat of oil is placed. Somo argue
that this would maxe nn oil bound
macadam which would serve the pur
pose temporarily. Work on one of
these projects will bo started during
tho coming week.
MURRAYMEAD

Hurley Turner and Miss Addle
Adams played in the state tennis
tournament in " Portland Tuesday,
and played against two California
players and made a most excellent
showing. Murraymead wns scTied
uled for Wednesday, but on account
of rain it was postponed to Friday.
A number of trophies and cups are
hung up for both singles and dou
bles. Hurley Turner and Reuben Sten
will piny in the doubles nnd Turner
and Miss Adams ulso in doubles.
Miss Ella Huttan will play In ladies'
doubles.- Rutherford, Turner and
Sten will play in singles.
This promises to be a very inter
esting play and it is to be hoped that
St. Helens will mako the usual good
diowing.
ROAD TO BE REPAIRED
Screenings aro being placed along
Willamette street nnd the county
road leading from St. Helens to tho
depot. Tho evident object is to make
temporary repairs to this section of
the road. The repairs will be hailed
with delight by those who have to
travel the roud, but the Mist thinks
in view of the fact that thousands
of dollars have been spent during the
past few years on this samo stretch
of road and nothing permanent has
yet been accomplished, that It would
be far wiser to save tho money now
about to be spent towards making a
hard surface pavement, something
that we will have to come to before
many years. In the meantime, the
repairs to bo mado will make travel
a little more comfortable
