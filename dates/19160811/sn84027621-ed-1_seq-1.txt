'Railroads and Employes
(Associated Press) , ,
New, York, Aug. 11 After delib
erating the greater part of the night,
the federal mediation board was no
nearer a solution of the deadlock in
the dispute between the four railroad
brotherhoods and the . employers. The
efforts of the mediators are virtually
at a halt, due, it is said, to the fact
hat the railroads refuse to grant any
concession other than arbitration, and
the men persist in their demands. It
is reported that unless there is an un
expected change within twenty-four
hours the board wilL suggest to Pres
ident Wilson that he intervene.

24. at 10:30 o'clock. The meeting Is
scheduled for the Seminole hotel.

Raney desired to hold it earlier, but
was delayed owing to the difficulty he
had in obtaining the names of the
newly-elected members of the commit

Probablv the most important mat
ter to come before the meeting will be
the untangling ' of the complications
caused by three of the candidates for
presidential electors failing to qualify
with the provisions of :the Bryan pri
mary law. Chairman Raney says tnat
this is a matter that can be easily
remedied. He wrote the "following
statement yesterday: . : -
"Three "democratic candidates for
presidential electors were nominated
in the recent primary rlorida is en
titled to six votes in the electoral col
lege. The state democratic executive
committee can select three additional
candidates and get up a petition sign
ed by 500 qualified voters and thereby
insure the placing of six democratic
candidates for presidential elctors on
the Official ballot in the general elec
tion of November next. There is no
danger whatever of Florida not hav

Girard, Ala., Aug. 11. The de
struction of liquor seized in the recent

poured into gutters leading to the
river wore off and the procedure be
came monotonous. It is estimated

rels of whisky, belonging to six resi
dents who recently left the state to
escape prosecution.
; A great crowd, including thousands
of persons from Columbus, Ga., across
the river from here, watched the
procedure, some even taking a hand
in the destruction. A bystander set
fire to a quantity of whisky, , which
trickled down the gutters, of the street
and th fire department was called
out when it seemed for a time that
the blue flames would reach the ware
house in which liquor had been stored.

SOLD EIVE MAXWELLS
FIVE DAYS
Ocala Agency Has Plenty of Cars in
; Stock and is Prepared to Fill
. . Orders Now '
The Ocala Maxwell agency, R. R.
Carroll proprietor, sold five new Max
well cars the first five days of this
week, a car a day, and delivered them
all. : "r . .--
Mr. Carroll sold a car to Mr. E. B
Duncan if Ocala, Mr. Peyton, one of
his salesmen, sold a car to Dr. W. B
Livingston of Kendrick, another to
Mr. W. O. iMcGowin of Lacota and
one to Mr. Nathan, Mayo of Summer
field, and Mr. Carroll one to Jessie
McDuffy, the well known colored
chauffeur in Ocala, who has been for
many years in the hack and later in
the automobile for hire business.
The Maxwell is the car that will
lead the sales in Florida this year.
The factory in Detroit, which was
doubled, in size and capacity a few
months ago, is now turning, out 500
cars per day and the live Florida
dealers are going to handle their full
share of them.
.With the substantial cut in price,
announced at the first of July,, and
the more important feature of the
continued delivery of wide or sixty
inch treads, the Maxwell will make a
clean-up" in Florida. This car had
'em going before, with its many sell
ing points of low- gasolene and oil
consumption, its great tire mileage
and remarkably low general upkeep,
with every modern convenience, but
with the new price and the wide
reads, in face of many other cars
shipping narrow or 56-inch treads to
the deep sandy roads of Florida, peo
pie are just naturally turning tothe
Maxwell. . . .
Another feature that is helping the
Maxwell is the fact that the models
will remain unchanged. .All parts for
the repair of the car are carried . in
Ocala by the agency, so that a cus
tomer, in case of an accident, does
not have to wait a long time, while
his car is out of use, on the ordering
of parts from uncertain sources.
These parts, by the way, are . the
lowest priced made for any car of the
size, weight and cost, and the factory
and dealer's replacement policy is the
mjost liberal of them all.
The Maxwell agency has one car in
the display room,feix on the railroad
siding in Ocala and six more that
have just left the factory, so that de-
iveries can be made RIGHT NOW.

APPROPRIATI HAS
GIVEU OUT
The Farmers of Florida Must Care
for the Health of their Pigs
Themselves
The -state board of health has no
tified R. W. Blacklock, county demon
stration agent, that the appropriation
for the free distribution of hog chol
era serum has given out, and that it
will, be impossible to furnish the
serum as . in the past.
"This means," Mr. Blacklock said
this morning, "that the farmers must
use the greater care in watching the
health of their pigs. Preventive
measures well carried out will help
materially to control the spread of
the disease."
Mr. Blacklock made the following
statement about the matter:
"The serum can be purchased at a '
cost of lx4c a cubic centimeter which
makes the cost of treating a 100
pound hog about 25c. Of course, when
the cholera does. appear it is cheaper
to buy the serum as it is always pos
sible to save more than enough ho?s f
to pay for the serum used, if the case
is taken in time. But the proper pre
cautions will many times prevent the
disease from showing up at all.
"Sanitation is the best preventive
for hog. cholera. Hogs kept free .
from lice and worms, in good clean
quarters, and given plenty of fresh
water, seldom have the cholera unless
the disease is brought to them thru
carelessness. Drain or fence off the v
bid mud wallow, cover the ground
where it was with plenty - of quick
lime, then give the hogs a wooden or
cement wallow and keep the surface
of the water covered with crude oil.
Disinfect all the feeding troughs by
cleaning them as well as possible and
then put them in good strong sunlight
for a day or so. Give the hogs good
clean water, a barrel with one of the
automatic drinking . cups attached
does exceptionally well.
f So much for preventive measures.
Now when cholera does appear in a
community, a sort of quarantine is
the only thing. If you- have1 cholera-
on 'your ' faM tell your neighbors,
then keep away from their hogs and
tell them to , keep away from yours.
Stop all unnecessary passing between
your farm .and others. If necessary
to go from one farm to another disin
fect your shoes by using any good
dipping solution or by rubbing the
soles well in caustic lime.
'These measures if well carried out
will help materially to control the
spreading of the disease from one
farm to another. To keep the cholera
from killing at least 80 per cent of
the hogs .where the cholera appears,
it will be necessary to innoculate the
entire herd with serum and do it at
once. -
