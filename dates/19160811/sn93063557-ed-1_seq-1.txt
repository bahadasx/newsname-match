POTATO CROP A FAILURE,
On account of tho extremely wet
wenther that obtained at tho time of
the plnnting seuson and nfterward,
the onrly potnto crop in Vergennes nnd
that soctiun is uhnost a fnilure. In
many cnses the seed was washed out
aftcr plnnting nnd in some cnses the
seed rotted in the ground even after
the third plnnting.
Reports from Lincoln and Starks
boro, which are centers of the potnto
mising in that part of the State, show
n similar condition, but in a lesser
degroe.
The statement is mnde by men who
are well informed that potatoes in that
section will coinmand a price of ?1 n
bushel nnd n few prophecy that they
will bring as high ns $1.50 a bushel be-
fore winter.

JANE GREY IN " WAIFS."
Jane Grey and William Desmond,
both popular favorites of the speaking
stage, will be presented by Thomas H.
Ince as co-stars in an original human in
terest drnma from the pen of J. C.
Hawks, at the opera house Tuesday,
August 15.
"Waifs" is a pathetic story of a
young clergyman's decline because of
his inadvertent use of hquor. Begin
ning with the incident ot his dismissal
from the church, the story is replete
with stirring situations, until through
his contrition, and the influence exerted
over him by a whole-hearted child of
the underworld, he is restored to the
ministry.
Miss Grey in "Waifs" plays the part
of "Rags," a Bowery maid, whose love
for the dejected clergyman results in
his regeneration.
