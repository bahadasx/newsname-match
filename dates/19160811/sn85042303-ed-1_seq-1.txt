BRITISH, DEFENDED BY GAS MASKS,
USE MACHINE GUNS AGAINST FOES
' BRITISH SOLDIERS WITH GHS A W5hJ5
Many observers, both liritish an .1 enemy, nt the western be.ttlefront bear testimony to the efllelent manner in wliieli
the I'.ritish soldiers have learned to inaiiii.ne inaelrine puns in prnetiee. On all Hides it is asserted that the
machine pun, with its accuracy and rapidity of lire, is the deadliest weapon known to modern warfare and
charging against batteries of machine guns in action is a (ask for the bravest soldiers. In defending their
lines against the present liritish and French offensives, the (icrmans ljave made effective use of machine guns
even after their positions had been "searched out," by the terrille fire of artillery, l'icture shows two Brit

SHARP HOTEL
LIKELY GONE
COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE "STAND
ING PAT," AND IT LOOKS AS IF
THERE WILL BE NOTHING
DOING WITH PROPOSITION.
"It's a matter of the slightest in
difference to me whether Mr. Sharp
builds a hotel in Ardmore or not," de
clared John Yell, county treasurer,
this morning, "but one thing you can
say for me is that the taxes and
penalty on his property will be col
lected just the same as it would be
on the property of some poor man in
the city.
"I want to see a hotel built, hrt
not at the price they are asking me
to stand for, and I do not propose to
do so. Mr. Sharp Is better able to
pay than many who have to, and as
far as I am concerned, he is going to
have to come across."
Continuing, Mr. Yell stated that this
matter had given him considerable
worry, and that he was going to dis
pose of it once for all.
As matters stand, the hotel ques
tion Is In a precarious condition, and
whether Sharp will build at all is
problematic, but if he fails to do so,
someone else will, and Ardmore will
have a modern hotel at last.
Pressure has been brought to bear
on the county commissioners and the
countyt attorney's office to have these
taxes and penalties remitted, but
there seems to be nothing doing, and
it looks as If Mr. Sharp will have to
"come across."
Taxes Guaranteed.
Later today It was reported that
'ome prominent oil men of thN i:tv
had guaranteed the taxes and penal
ties against this property, and they
hope to see work on the hotel 'Jogin
nt once.

EXISTS FOR A

COMMISSIONERS WILL GO ON
RECORD AT PRESENT SESSION
PERMANENT ROADS ARE NE
CESSITY NOW.
If the Hoard of County Commis
sioners contemplate calling for a bond
election for the construction of per
manent roads in the county, they rive
net Intimated it to anyone outside of
tlxir particular circle, and .iHiioiisu
there is a general feeling that they
should do so, they are as yet non
committal, and will probably not take
up ibis matter until just before the
close of this session. The commis
sioners went to Dallas yesterday on
business for the county, and will re
turn today to resume their delibera
tions. The road bond question is one of
vital importance to the county at
present. Carter count; already has
the reputation of having the worst
roads of any county in the southern
part of the state, and it is up to the
taxpayers to see that this matter is
rectified. Permanent rotids will mean
much to every citizen of the county,
but the only way they can be secured
is through a bond issue. The com
missioners will make their anot,unte-
nient before the end of the present
session.
