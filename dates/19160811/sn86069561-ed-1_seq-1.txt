Prince Albert gives

it's made by a patented
process that cuts out
bite and parch! Prince Albert has always

Bryant came for us with his auto
and we traveled over a portion of
the city and saw the new pike,
which is something that Rockcas

we wish to say that Mt Vernon far'
surpasses our expectations in

Oklahoma. Whim Adams and his
two sons who have made their
home in Indiana for the past two
years are with relatives here for
a few days. We often wonder if
the property owners m our little
town ever stop to think when
they are cleaning their yards,
and dumping all kinds of trash
out in the streets in front of their
property, that they are injuring
the looks ot their property,not im
proving it. We also wonder why
it is that the Board of Trustees
do not .see that these property
owners, or those who violate
these laws, are not prosecuted?
We are a shamed to have to call
the attention of the public to
these things, but when folks
wdl clean out their back yard
and carry all kinds of trash, chips
rocks, weeds and old cans and
carefully place them on the
streets it is time that they know
other folks are looking at such
cusseduess. Mr. and Mrs A. M.
