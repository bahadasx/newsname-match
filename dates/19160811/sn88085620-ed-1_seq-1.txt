ST. LOUIS UNIONS PLAN
TO FOLLOW UP VICTORY
St. Louis. —With the successful ter
mination recently of the strike of the
municipal garbage drivers, organized
labor is planning to renew its fight
here to compel the administration to
live up to its promise to pay the pre
vailing union rates of wages on all
city jobs.
The garbage drivers were out ex-
actly five days, demanding $65 a
Tl month, the prevailing wage. The city
■i \ refused to give in until the health
board advised the mayor that the un
collected offal in the residence sec
tion in hot weather was liable to
cause an outbreak of disease. Theu
the authorities got busy, and agreed
to pay the rates demanded by the
drivers.
A conference was held by union
representatives this week and an
other delegation will wait on the
mayor in an effort to make him live
up to the promises made. It is de
clared that the city administration Is
dodging the issue by declaring that
as many city employes are unorgan
ized, the prevailing rate of wageß re-

union asserts that as no union work

THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE .
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST
WALSH WRITES
TO ROCKEFELLER
Mine Official Responsible for
"Prostitution of the Ballot,"
Says Walsh
Washington, D. C, Aug. 10.—An
swering the telegram of John D.
Rockefeller, jr., in reply to his own
letter concerning the Colorado Su
preme Court's condemnation of the
Rockefeller methods in Colorado,
Frank P. Walsh, chairman of the
committee on industrial relations, de
clares in a letter just sent to Mr.
Rockefeller that "the total ignorance
and misunderstanding which you
plead, taken in connection with the
abhorrent facts which the highest
court in Colorado has now condemned
in public to the world, are convincing
proof that you should abdicate that
'imperial control,' as the court has
characterized it, and give the workers
who produce your wealth their right
ful opportunities of citizenship and of
self-expression."
Mr. Walsh's reply leter, in full, is
as follows:
Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
No. 26 Broadway,
New York City.
My Dear Sir: I have received your
telegram of July 14th, in reply to my
letter to you of July 11th, your tele
gram being as follows:
"Your letter of July 11 has just
been forwarded to me here, where
I am spending my summer vaca
tion, and is the first word which
has recahed me in regard to the
decision of the Supreme Court of
Colorado, referred to in your let
ter. My office informs me that
as yet they have seen only news
paper accounts of the decision,
and at once took steps to ascer
tain the facts. Pending the re
ceipt of this information, I can
only say that any offenses, no
matter by whom committed, which
could have been justly charac
terized in such language as you
have quoted, would be quite as
abhorrent to me as to you, and I
am confident that no such condi
tions as you describe coudl exist
in the camps of the Colorado Fuel
& Iron Company under the plan
of representation which was
adopted by joint action of the
company and its employes at the
time of my visit to Colorado last
fall."
In view of your assertion of entire
lack of knowledge of the decision of
the Supreme Cmirt of Colorado in the
contested election cases, involving
the conduct of yourself and associates
in the political and industrial control
of Colorado, I am taking the liberty i
of enclosing to you, herewith, a copy
of the opinion and judgment of the
court.
You will note from this opinion
that the appalling arraignment of
what your organization has accom
plished in Colorado is taken entirely
from the testimony of the general
manager of your own company. What
standing, therefore, ought your so
called "industrial plan" for the opera
tion of your mines and the control of
your workers' lives have in the esti
mation of the people of our country?
Your expression of horror and de
testation at what the Supreme Court
of Colorado has condemned, are, of
course, natural and commendable
upon the part of any man. However,
this does not alter the fact that What
the supreme judges of Colorado have
so vigorously condemned are the acts
of the organization which you dom
inate and direct,
Declaring that your company had
conspired with county officials to
commit these crimes against citizen
ship and against the law, you will note
that the court says: "We find no
such example of fraud within the
books."
It is declared that, to keep your
control of your workers by controlling
the public forces for law and order,
your organization had prostituted the
ballot and prohibited free public dis
cussion of public questions, had vio
lated the law for registration and
I elect ions, had coerced and intimidated
your employees, and had used your
| arbitrary power of discharge over the

Your avowal of ignorance of the
fraudulent and criminal results of
your mastery in Colorado does not

organization will bring about better
conditions in Colorado.
On the contrary, the total ignorance
and misunderstanding which you
plead, taken in connection with the

OP ORGANIZED LABOR.
WHAT TRAINMEN
DEMAND OF R. R.
Sioux City, lowa, Tribune Gives
a Few Facts About Rail
road Men
The railway managers are flooding
the country with publicity regarding
the "increase in wages" that is being
demanded by the members of the four
railway brotherhoods who are en
gaged in actual handling of trains.
It seems the railroad managers can
not make an honest presentation of
this issue any more than they can of
the rate question, the question of
their valuation, or their inside
financing.
The railway employees are not ask
ing for an advance of wages. In fact,
they are asking for the adoption of a
plan that will decrease the income of
many of them. They are asking for
an eight-hour day, instead of being
compelled to stay out on the road
from 12 to 16 hours.
Their argument in favor of this
change is reasonable. They say that
passenger trainmen and fast freight
trainmen would not be materially af
fected by such a rule as few of them
are now on the road more than eight
hours. The men who would be af
fected are the trainmen who handle
"dead" freight trains. These men are
on the road usually the limit permit
ted by the federal laws —16 hours —■
and often longer than that before
they get back to their homes. Their
expenses on the road must come out
of their own wages.
The greatest evil, however, is the
physical and mental effect upon men
working that length of time. It needs
no argument to prove that after eight
or ten hours' continuous strain, one's
physical and mental activities get
sluggish. It is during these periods,
say trainmen, that wrecks most fre
quently occur; and then the railroad
managements blame it on to the
"carelessness" of the railroad cm-
Even the traveler in the Pullman
gets tired after a 10-hour ride during
the day. But the man in the engine
cab must keep fresh; he must keep
his mental activities keen for he must
see every signal, keep in mind every
order, and when he enters a railroad
yard must know just what every one
of all the way from 50 to 300 switch,
signal and block lights mean, and if
they are as they should be to guaran
tee him a clear track. Yet eye fatigue
is one of the first symptoms and re
sults of long hours of work, and men
tal dullness comes a close second.
"Safety first" for the traveling public
demands that men on railroads be not
overworked.
There is yet another side —one
which affects the commercial side of
railroading Why are some freight
trains handled with such speed that
men who handle them are not on their
runs over eight hours, while other
freight trains hauled with the same
class of motive power and over the
same right-of-way, are 14 to 20 hours
clearing one division? Why is a car
load of fruit from 60 to 72 hours
coming from New Orleans to Sioux
City, while a carload of other freight
is three to four weeks?
Trainmen say the railroads so over
load "dead" freight trains that they
cannot make their time. This is done
in order to increase the railroad's
profit. This is why the trainmen who
bandit these trains must "lay out" on
sidings and at way stations, and be
on their run 14 to 16 hours.
Trainmen also offer the hint to the
shipper that if the eight-hour law
goes into efect, it will solve the
freight car famine to a great extent.
Railroads will then speed up their
freight schedule, in order to avoid
overtime wages, and freight cars will
be rushed to their destination and un
loaded instead of ding-donging along
on the road for weeks. —Sioux City,

FEDERATION ADHERES TO THE
PRINCIPLE OF DIRECT LEGISLATION
Tacoma, Wash.—To Organized La
bor in the State of Washington, Greet
ing: The executive committee of the
Washington State Federation of Labor
in its meeting July 16 spent several
hours discussing the initiative and
referendum campaigns which we have
conducted, trying to put our finger on
mistakes, if any occurred, and find
where more effectiveness could be
brought about. While the committee
has no power to determine legislative
policy, that power being vested in the
membership expressed in convention,
yet the committee wishes to lay be
fore the membership facts and deduc
tions arrived at In its discussion.
In the first place the committee
believes the legislative principle em
bodied in the initiative and referen
dum to be fundamentally sound. The
people ought to have the right to a
direct voice in the passage of laws
affecting their welfare. Our system
of a state legislature gives the peo
ple that right in theory only. The
people ought to have the right to re
view the acts of their hired men in
the legislature, and, if they have been
false to their trust, have some method
of setting their action aside. No, we
are decidedly not ready to abandon
the initiative and referendum or see
its machinery crippled.
Nor are we by any means tdesirous
of abandoning our legislative coalition
with the organized farmers. They
have kept faith with us and in no
campaign did they sacrifice our meas
ures for their own. You may term
them employers, but they a.*e just
as much victims of legislative chi
canery, of our whole political, indus
trial and financial system of robbery,
as are the city workers. Nor has any
movement in twenty years got under
the hides of the exploiting classes in
this state as has the trade unionists
sailing under the banner of the joint
legislative committee. Every member
of that committee is as cordially hated
by the powers that prey as were the
snakes of Erin's isle by the good St.
Patrick.
In 1911 we circulated seven initia
tive bills, known as the Seven Sisters.
The machinery of initiation was un
tried and we did not realize just how
hard a task we had set ourselves.
We succeeded in getting enough sig
natures to place them upon the bal
lot, but only after the hardest kind
of work and a campaign of misrepre
sentation and bitter opposition which
aroused the fighting blood in our
people. In that campaign an average
of 32,896 signatures were secured on
each bill. The farmers furnished 62
per cent of that number, or an aver
age of 20,110; the union forces fur
nished 3S per cent, or an average of
12,786 signatures.
In 1915 we referred to the people
seven bills passed by the legislature
This campaign was necessarily short,
but it was decisive, public sentiment
being enraged at the reactionary leg
islature. In that campaign the farm
ers furnished 4S per cent of the sig
natures and the cities 52 per cent. In
a short campaign of a negative na
ture, it was to be expected that the
cities would furnish the major por
tion of the signatures. The bulk of
population centered In the cities and
the machinery could be and was more
quickly set in motion.
This year the joint legislative com
mittee selected four measures and
they were endorsed by the State Fed
eration of Labor in annual session at
North Yakima. In this campaign we
found the cards stacked against us.
The universal registration law passed
by the last legislature placed nearly
insurmountable obstacles in rural
precincts. Registration in country
districts was a new and unfamiliar
process to rural residents. Kvery
trick and device was used by our op
ponents to make rural registration
difficult. In the cities intimidation!
was practiced in some instances to
scare working people. Outside of
our labor papers we were unable to
get publicity for our bills. We fell
on an average about ten thousand
short of enough signatures to place
our bills upon the ballot. The aver
age number of signatures received
was 22.796. Of this number the farm
ers furnished 38 per cent, or 8,620
names, the cities 62 per cent, or 14,
In Organization
Lies the Hope
of Labor
176 names. The three large cities
showed an actual increase in signa
tures received over the campaign of
1914. In 1914 Seattle secured 7,000
names, this year. 9,818. Tacoma in
1914 secured 497 names, in 1916,
1,045. Spokane in 1914 furnished
1,500 names, in 1916, 2,000 names.
Despite the handicap placed on the
rural districts, the trade unionists
might have secured enough signatures
alone and unaided to put the bills
upon the ballot. It appears to the
members of the executive committee
that in future campaigns it will be
wise policy to further restrict the
number of measures desired to initiate
and to select measures which par
ticularly affect the organizations rep
resented in this coalition and which
are well understood by our members.
We must bear in mind that the
work of procuring signatures must be
purely voluntary under the law and
in the very nature of things must be
done by people who work for a live
lihood and must do this work in their
spare moments. The men and women
who give of their time to this work,
do so because they want badly the
particular measures enacted into law
and the practical method seems to be
to select measures, the subject mat
ter of which our workers are familiar
with and which constitute a direct
benefit to our organizations. We say
this with no thought of censure or
criticism of bills we have selected in
the past, but with a realization that
people work hardest for the things
they want most.
Let us not be discouraged, nor
downhearted at the failure of this
initiative campaign. Had we in our
industrial movement quit at the first
rebuff we received on the industrial
field, abandoned all organization ef
fort at the first lost strike, we would
never have built up the splendid la
bor movement we have in this coun
try today. '4|J
Let us not for one moment forget
that we have a campaign of educa
tion to conduct in connection with
the seven referred measures which
will tax every bit of energy we pos
sess. It ought to be evident to every
thinking man and woman within our
ranks that our enemies have engaged
in a campaign of extermination of our
movement. The open shop cry which
is being waged in every part of the
country with renewed vigor can have
no other meaning. Whether we aspire
to better the conditions of the work
ing people by legislative means or
united industrial action, the forces of
greed are alert and powerful and are
bringing powerful pressure to create
an adverse public sentiment to the
whole organized labor program.
Of the referendum measures to be
voted upon, the bills requiring that
petitions may be signed only at reg
istration offices and in the presence
of registration officials, and the anti
picket.ing measure, are of the most
vital importance to labor The former
make it practically impossible to ever
initiate or refer legislation. The lat
ter strikes at a fundamental prin
ciple of trade unionism, the passage
of whcih means a serious blow to
union effectiveness. How many of us
realize, for instance, that to publish
an unfair list in your own labor pub
lication, or to manitain an unfair list
upon a blackboard in your own meet
ing hall, constitute a law violation
under a strict interpretation of this
act? In educating the voters of these
measures, organized labor faces the
most stupendous educational cam
paign it has ever undertaken in this
state. Our forces must be organized
for this campaign as never before.
It will be vain to spend our time be
wailing mistakes or losses in the
past. Ours is the constructive task
to build an organization capable of
rendering effective work in the bet
terment of our people
