TWO 8ERM0N8 THAT
ARE W0TH REPORTING.
On Sunday July 30 In tha court
house there were delivered twn a.
! mona much above the ordinary in abil
ity and delivery and which would bave
attracted attention anywhere. The
first of these waa preached by Rer.
L. E. McEldowney, pastor of M. E.
Church, South, who read aa the morn
ing; lesson the last chapter of Malawi
in the second vra of which there is
a bint of the subject which be selected
for one of his best efforts. The read-
era of the Newa will find those words
in that last chapter of the Old Teat
ament- Hla text proper waa from the
th to 14th verses of the 7th chapter
of Revelation. Following a custom of
Mr. McEldowney's when be has more
than one or two verses in bis text, he
reads but one verse, tha 14th, inform
ing his congregation that it would be
well for them if they wanted to pre
serve the continuity of thought con
tained In all these verses, if they would
when they went home read the re
maining five. Following- Mr. McEl
downeys habit the Newa will give but
one verse which is aa follows: "And
I said unto him. Sir, thou kooweat.
And he aald unto me. These are they
which came out of great tribulation,
and have waabed their robes and made
them white In the blood of the Lamb."
Then followed a aermon characteria
tically Mr. McEldowney a. It bristled
with southern and fairly sparkled with
epigrammatic sentences. These make
a review of the aermon quite difficult
for while listening; to It one is apt to
think so much of that which he gave
them to think about that it becomes a
difficult matter to do the subject Jus
tice. The minister's subject . might
well be said to bave been aa we think
Mr. McEldowney himself might have
said It. Rags versus Righteousness.
The filthiest rags humanity can wear
become, when washed in the blood of
the Lamb, nut rags any longer, but
robes robes of righteousness and this
was the keynote, the dominant idea.
aa it were, of hla entire discourse. He
also spoke in this connection of the
healing power of the divine MasterTs
hand. For Instance, when the woman
who had suffered so long- before she
had touched hem. of his garment, and
upon whose flesh the fiery fingers of
pain had made their cruel impressions.
became healed at the touch of the Mas
ter's robe. Even should the New at
tempt to give a verbatim report of this.
as well as of any other of the reverend
gentleman's efforts. It would utterly
fail should It attempt to give the Into
nations of bis voice, and when he uses
his tenderest tones In repeating what
the Master said, it matter but little
whether he uses some of the Inimitable

late simple narrative of some of thei' 7 1 " , . j "
incidents of the life of Jesus Christ aa
recorded by the evangelists or If he
choose to tell us about the admonitions
and advice of Paul in his letters to va
rious churches, or when St. John on
the isle of Iatmos gave his wonderful
visions to the world, it Is all one and
the same, there runs through them all
the great idea of tho salvation of man
through a crucified Christ.- It matters
but little what the idea may be that he
seeks to elaborate, someway, somehow.
the Idea of the salvation of man pre
vails no matter how filthy his rags
might have been, the "blood" changes
them to robes of righteousness.
And the News is lead to speak of
another characteristic of Mr. McEldow
ney's pulpit efforts, and that Is the
nmaxlng facility with which he can ap
ply his exceedliiRly descriptive des
criptive to anything that ho wi.-hea

to that upon which h la talking. '
Tha other of tho two notahla ser
nwin rxfenxd to In lha furegoing was
thn excellent discourse delivered on
Sunday nuthl by Rev. F, K. Shannon.
I In read fr hi scriptural leaaon a
part nf tha ltd charptnr uf Humans,
betitnnnlua with tha liih Versa and
concluding with the last Consdously
or unconsciously when be read this
lesson, Mr. Shannon put enough em
phasis, or feeling, if you prefer that
word, to betray to the attentive bear
er the fact that ha had chosen tha
last two verses of tha chapter for tha
base of his sermon. Pos I am per
suaded that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor pnndpaiitiea. nor now-
era nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall ba able to aepav
rata us from the love of God, which
is In Jesus Christ, our Lord."
Almost at the outset of this discourse
Mr. Shannon said that ona to fully
comprehend the progressiva beauty
and grandeur of this chapter should
read the 7th chapter and coming upon
the lift chapter, It was like emerging
from tha Jungle upon tha high, broad
table land, upon which by the "'nct
gradations, yon reach tha summit, you
could turn your gaze backward and
comprehend tha rich beauty of It aiL
And Indeed more than one who beard
Sunday night's sermon baa tried tha
experiment of re-reading. If they had
once before read It, and then peroains;

new beauty and fuller and deeper
truths than they bad thouaht that the
grand old chapter contained. It fat
well to notice some of the things wtOcfa

Death, life, angela. principalities.

come, and then he continues until
the climax ta reached: "Nor height nor
depth. nor any other creature." No
tice the word creature. Mr. Shannon
gave It a reading; or meaning wnicn
probably half of hia bearers had never
beard before. He said the Greek ren
dering; is creation, not creature, which

the universe should, la his wisdom,
hereafter create something in the liv

created, that even these, whatever
they might be, should not be agio to
eperate us from the love of Christ.
This Mr. Shannon considered the great
climax of the apostle's subline declara
tion. Mr. Shannon then took np and
considered a few of these which the
apostle declares were not able to sepa
rate from the love of God. For in
stance, death. Death had no terrors to
the man who knew that very soon it
must come to him by the behest of the
Emperior. Who knew that daily, yea
hourly, the trumpet of the executioner
was called Its victims to the heads

the mighty and willing; Savior. Not
only did death have no terrors, bat
there was no life that be could live that
would be able to separate him from
God or Christ. . The allurements of the
world, such as powers, principalities,
dominions, had no temptation for him
and could not separate him. In ad
dition to its intellectual flavor and
charm Mr. Shannon's aermon bad the
added merit of being delivered by a
man whose Iear cut pronunciation
and enunciation made it pleasant to
listen tot- His voice far carrying; and
farreaching makes it distinctly beard
in almost any building; despite miser
able aceoustlcs. Mr. Shannon baa a
custom which adda not a little to the
attractiveness of his sermons. He fa

appreciative reader. When he finds

discussion he quotes it at the proper
time and does It very effectively.
