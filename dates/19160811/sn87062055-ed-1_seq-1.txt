BIGGER, BETTER FLAGSTAFFilDEA.PREVAILS
It is practically settled that there
will he several more blocks of street
vpaving put .down in Flagstaff this
summer, than were originally con-
tracted for.
The street along west of the court
house grounds is now being torn up
and being prepared for paving dope,
while the contractors are waiting for
' new parts of machinery for handling
the bitullthlc mixture. While there
has been little complaint from the
people at the delays, the contractors
have not had all fair weather in their
work. Had it not been for the break
down thev exnected to finish all the
work under way by August 3rd, but
accidents will happen.
Mr. Morton, who is m charge or
the work says that there arc but few
signatures standing in the way of
paving Leroux street to the city lim
its and he believes that all will be
secured by the time the work on that
street commences again. It is almost
certain that another block east and
another block west on Aspen avenue
will be paved this summer, as most
of the property owners have signed
up for thd work.
The people have not as yet hndn
fair chance to use and appreciate the
streets already laid owing to the
numerous blockades where connecting

years and was prominently mentioned
two years ago by' republicans as a
candidate for thc office.- He has had
good experience in political and legis
lative matters in years past and is
well posted on thc needs -and re
quirements of Northern Arizona as to
laws and government
He has made good from boyhood
up by his own unaided "efforts and
ability. While he is much. better ac
quainted in the west enil of the coun

thc past few' years, he has many en
thusiastic friends in this end of thc
county who are boosting his clindi
dacy for the place on, the ticket this

Ho is" the kind of timber that would
undoubtedly make good in the legis

BOARD OF TRADE HOLDS
INTERESTING SESSION
There was a good attendance at the
regular monthly meeting of the Flag
staff Board of Trade at the town hall
Wednesday evening and several im
portant measures came up during the
session.
A communication from representa
tives in Congress brought out the fact
that the building site appropriation
for the new postofficc has been trim
med by the committee on site appro
priation from $10,000 to $7,500. It
was the unanimous opinion of those
present that the appropriation, if
passed, would be too small to -secure
a desirable site for the new govern
ment building in Flagstaff. It is pos
sible, however, to meet a .deficit in
ing appropriation, thereby still leav
ing the purchase of a 'site an open
issue.
The board was also informed that
the fish hatchery bill would be passed
at this session, but that the location
of the hatchery would be up to the
department, which would send a rep
resentative from Washington to look
over the available locations. It seems
likely that Oak Creek will receive this
industry owing to its suitability and
location.
Through the efforts of the board
stopovers" havo bceh granted on No.
3, to passengers east of Trinidad
holding tickets for points south and
west of Barstow. While this is quite
a concession for Flagstaff it is the
intention of the board to obtain the
use of No. 3 for passengers from
New Mexico w'ishing to come tot Flag
staff. The fountain committee reported
that the new drinking fountain, do
nated by the board at the depot, will
soon be in operation, the delay in the
work being caused by sewer condi
tions and the slow arrival of the fix
tures. As yet only the inscription
.for the plate has been submitted, but
Secrctary.Bcrg will be glad to receive
suggestions on this line for the next
few days.
Aftpr n (lisrns.ttinn rppnrilinc a new
city hall," library and the sewer sys
tem, a committee was appointed to
draft resolutions to the town council

h.c,d .f?r thc P01?081; of. P"dnB
I tnC oltl wwer and en.argngtnc pres
cm sys".
It is understood that thc
sewer owners will be glad to sell thc
system to thc city for just- what ,it
cost, and itis the belief of the board
that a majority of thc tax payersjn
Flagstaff are in favor of thq, city
owning and operating the sewer sys
tem. The unsatisfactory conditions
existing in some parts of town would
be eliminated by such a purchase and
extension, while the cost now would
be comparatively small.
Numerous communications were
read apd disposed of and thc board
adjourned to meet on the second
Tuesday of the month hereafter as
thc h.all will be vacant on that date.
P. J. Miller is Campaigning
Mr. P. J. Miller, democratic candi
date for thc nomination for Corpora
tion Commissioner, has been doing
the north the past week in the inter
est of his candidacy and was in Flag
staff for a few days. Mr. Miller is
confident that he will land his. name
on the ticket this fall in spite of all
the contentions against him. If, as
it'would appear at the 'present writ
ing, Gov Hunt has pulled off his
friend Proctor in favor of Betts, thc
bets would appear to bein favor of
Betts to the discomfiture of Miller.
Boy Tagged for a Long Trip
Russel Turner is expected to arrive
tonight from Imia, Alberta, Canada.
Russel is but eight years of age and
is making the trip along with a tag
nttached to him giving his destina
tion, with the railroad companies
guaranteeing the safe delivery of the
little fellow to R. B. Reynolds, the
packing house expert for Babbitt
Brothers.
Mr. Reynolds and the . father .of
Russel are friends of long standing.
Recently his mother died and his
father turned to his friend Reynolds
for help in his extremity. Thc little
fellow was hardly old enough to make
the different changes necessary on
the long trip, so a tag of. instructions
was resorted to.

NATIONAL 0L0 TRAILS "
ASSOCIATION TO MEET
The first annual convention of the
National Old Trails Road Association
will be held at Her'ington, Kansas,
September 14th and 15th, 1910, which
meeting will be the most important
event in the history of the association.
We have ceased talking about it
and are now actively engaged in
hard-surfacing the road from Ocean
to Ocean, says President J. M. Lowe.
Every wide-awake, progressive citizen
who doesn't .believe, that the roads'
which grandpa used are good enough
are invited to come out and devote a
little time to the effort to inaugurate
real constructive measures.
Every town and city along the line
of the National Old Trails Road is
entitled to a voice in the affairs of
this Association and a live, enthusias
tic delegation from each community is
expected. .
ProgVam and details of the conven
tion wll be announced later.
Officers and members of any other
road organization, local, state or. na

GEORGE T. nERRINGTON
IS OUT FOR SUPERVISOR
.George T. Herrington has consent
ed to make the race for the. office of
Supervisor at the request of friends.
So f&r he is the only republican can
didate who has announced his intcn-1
tions of making thc race from the
Flatrstaff end of the countv.
Mr. Herrington has been a resident
of Flagstaff for the past fifteen years,
all )f which time he has had the
management of the Flagstaff Electric
Light Co., an institution which he has
build up from a meagre beginning to
one pf the best institutions of the kind
and Isize in the state. He is a gradu
ate pf thc engineering department of
the University of Kansas, and a
painstaking, conservative man, who
believes in a real progressive prog
ress! veness in other words not mere
ly for the sake of'a change, but a
chaiCjjfor the betterment of condi-
uuns as lie iuuhu uiem.
Another sample of his good effi
cinccy can be found in connection
with his work as ,schobl trustee for
the Flagstaff district during thc past
five years, where services are gratui
tous, but thc consciousness of a public
duty to perform was uppermost. The
big new building was built without
the" aid of bonds; thc retaining walls,
graded grounds and a complete equip
ment to go with each department of
the school is a result of his efficiency
in that line.
In the most exacting duties of both
the lighting and big power plant;
school or any other work be has un
dertaken, he has shown that ability
which is most essential to the right-i
ful conduct of public work where the
people entrust him with their affairs,
both large and small. No clique,
crowd or interest could influence him
in his work of conducting thc affairs
of the county on other than a strictly
business basis and in thc interest of
those who have the taxes to pay.

LIVE REPUBLICAN CLUB ORGANIZED .
IN FLAGSTAFF LAST MONDAY EVENING
A real live (Republican ciub
was
organized in Flagstaff last Monday
evening over the city hall, at an in
itial meeting in which nearly 100
members signed up for the coming
campaign.
There' was plenty of good enthus-.
iasm, with a spirit which shows con
clusively that the republicans of this
city arc nlive to existing conditions
and are going to have iheir say as to
what shall be done in Coconino coun
ty this year:
Dr. M. G. Fronske was elected
president of the club by acclamation,
with John Zalaha as secretary and
treasurer without a dissenting vote.
The organization started out with
an organized purpose, not of a per
sonal nature, but with the idea of re
deeming the original republican coun
ty from democracy, along strictly
political lines.
Coconino county,' has been accused
of being a republican county which
the democrats have carried more ori
less every election year; for that rea--son
the hundred members so far col
lected promised that the next election
would' make a republican county out
of a republican county, let the chips,
fall where they may.
The question of registration under
the present restrictions of a dem
0Cratic recorder were discussed, with
a decision that all voters, women in
cluded should have a fair ehance to
get their names on the great register,
whether the present democratic rec-

Tqesday afternoon by auto -via the ,
Grand Canyon, leaving the next day
for the south. Of course, uhile they
all agree that it is impot Bible for
vthcm to keep pace with The Sun, we
are magnanimous enough to admit
they run a close race for first honors.
Abbott volunteered thc information
that during the trip to the canyon he
had noticed considerable scenery ly
ing around loose in. out of thc way
places, but concluded it had been
dropped down too far away from
places where people arc more nume
rous, a careless extravagance of na
ture's which he proposed to call at
tention- to later.
Editor Milnes was somewhat sur
prised that there were not more
potato ranches in the country visited,
especially since there was so much
scenery for eyes to see. '
Senator Sims President of
State Senate Visits Flagstaff
Dr. W. P. Sims, president of the
state senate, accompanied by Mrs.
Sims Jnd'son, arrived in Flagstaff
Wednesday from Bisbqe by auto.
They.remained over a day here visit
ing friends leaving yesterday for
Grand Canyon. Senator Sims is wear
ing a great big Olney button and is
not the least diffident about telling
who he is for in the , governorship
fight. He is confident that Olney will
land the nomination and claims the
southern part of the state will give.
hima good majority.
Judge Milligan for Justice
J. Q. Milligan is asking the support
of his friends for the "nomination on
the democratic ticket for the office of
Justice of the .Peace f6r the Flagstaff
precinct.
Judge Milliganheld the office for a
mimber of years previous to the elec
tion of Judge Harrington and Svas a
good, peace Officer who maintained the
respect and confidence of the people
and offenders alike.
He has been a resident pf Flagstaff
for the past twenty-seven years con
sequently is full conversant with the
wishes and needs of the people in this
justice precinct, and he is the char
acter of many who believe in justice!
to friend and foe alike.
The justice court, though a smaller
division of judicial .affairs, is of equal
importance to the higher courts in .the
every day life of the citizen, and a
position which requires good judg
ment aside from a mere knowledge of
law as it is written. Judge Milligan
has the advantage of experience ini
the work of helping to settle the dif
ferencerand troubles of neighbors
and hisfriends are confident that he
would utilize this knowledge to the
advantage if elected
again to that

office.!

order saw fit to make it hard or easy
lor them to do so. That thc autocrat
of the recorder's office, Mr. Cronin,
had stirred up a hornet's nest by his
arbitrary action in refusing sto allow
any one to take registrations but him
self and deputy, and then Sy coming
to his office to do so, was plainly
manifested by the number present
Steps were taken at this meeting to
see that every one was registered who ,
wished to be registered, regardless of
the "extra" expense to the county, or
the "extra" work it might make the
recorder.
Different committees were appoint
ed to carry on the different depart
ments of the work and there was a
bunch of harmony present that
argued ill for the opposing party
from now on. '
The younger element seemed to
prevail during the meeting and it
promises to be one of thc first real
republican clubs ever organized in
Flagstaff.
Special arangements are v being
made for a meeting which will in
clude all ladies who wish to belong to
the cluti, when special refreshments'
will be provided. Notice of this will
be given as soon as the organization
has been perfected.
All republicans are requested to get
together; there are no fees and dues.
All that is required is for one to an
nounce his or her intentions to aid
and assist the republican party and
its principles.
