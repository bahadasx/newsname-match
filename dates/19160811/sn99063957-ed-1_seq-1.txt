GREAT DRIVE OF ALLIES

French Strike First Blow, Capturing Railway Station of
Doiran '38. Miles 'North cr Salonika-Athens- Reports
I Great Battle Raging Attempt to Drive Teutons and
r Bulgarians Out of Serbia Bns Russians Still Sweep
Forward
By Ed L,
(United Press Staff
London, Aug. 11. Indications that the long expected
offensive of the allies in the Balkans may have begun
were contained in dispatches received here this afternoon.
By a sudden blow on the Doiran front, 38 miles north
of Salonika, French troops have captured the railway
station at Doiran, evacuated by the allies when they re
treated from Serbia last fall. A statement from the
French war office carried this, announcement.
An Athens dispatch to the Central News about the
same hour reported a great battle raging on the Balkan
front. The allies have occupied not only the Doiran
station but high ground adjacent, the dispatch said.
The British war office thus far has made no announce
ment of the beginning of the great drive expected to
sweep the armies of the central empires out of Serbia.
For several days advices from
have reported increasing anxiety at Berlin over rumors
that the allies Balkan offensive was about to begin while
the great triple offensive on the western, eastern and
' Italian fronts was under way.
The allies, Berlin reported, planned to squeeze the
Austro-Gemians and Bulgars by pressure on four fronts
simultaneously, hoping at the same time to draw Rumania
into the war against the Austro-Germans.
The news of the allied success in the Balkans followed
announcement of new and sweeping successes by the Rus
sians in their advance against Lemberg from the south
west. " ' '
The Slavs are crpssisng the Bistritza river three miles
east of Stanislau and have made a rapid advance against
the important city of Halitz, at the same time continuing
their advance on the Sereth river further north with
large captures in prisoners.
The western front has been compnra-
.tively quiet for the past 24 hours, I
though the British war office this after-
noon announced slight additional gains ,
northwest of I'ozieres and near Hazen-
tin-Le-Petit. Rome dispatches also an
nounced further progress in the fight
nig nround Uoritz.
No important fighting has occurred
on the Balkan front since last Decem
ber, when the Anglo-French expedition
ary forces under General Snrrail, retired
from southern Serbia under heavy pres
sure by superior forces of Austro-Ger-jiinns
and Bulgars.
The fighting at Doiran officially an
nounced today is the most important
Balkan engagement since the allied re
treat. Whether it marks the actual be
uiiuiing of the offensive by the British,
French and the reequipped Serbian
army is not yet definitely known.
Keeent reports trom Athens stated
that, a very large part of the Austro-jnn
iermnn troops tnnt uetenuea tne eai-1
knn line had been withdrawn because
o'f the pressure of allied troops on other
fronts.

Petrograd, Aug. 11. Striking west
ward with amazing rapidity, the right
wing of Genernl I.ctchitsky's army has
reached the Dniester river Bouth of Ma
rinnipol, which is only 10 miles from
the important tpwn of Halitz, it was
officially announced today.
News of this important success tem
porarily overshadowed the advance
against the city of Stanislau, south ot
Hulitz whose fall is now regarded as a
matter of but a few hours. The war
office announced that bridges are being
thrown across the Bistritza river, three

I 1 he Austrmns were prepared for a most
stubborn resistance nt the Hulitz
bridgehead, where they expected to
block the crossing of the Dniester nad
a further advance by the czar's troops
against Lemberg.

Letchitsky evidently took the enemy
by complete surprise, throwing n force
across the Zlota Lipa river, northeast
of StaniHlnu, he began a swift advance
agninst Halitz on the north bank of the
Dniestor. The official statement is
sued yesterday placed the advance

official statement, reported the Dniester
reported south of Mnrinmpol, which is
directly north of Stanislau and only 10
miles from Halitz.
This unexpected maneuver not only is
expected to force the immediate evacua
tion of Stanislau but it also endangers
the position of a large Austro-German
force south of the Dniester.

advance yesterday. Besides capturing
several villnges and woods, the Russians

Does Not Concede Defeat But
Thinks It Probable, Will
Back Rival
Topeka, Kan., Aug. 11. This state's
"fighting woman", Dr. Eva Harding,
probably has been defeated in her race
for the democratic congressional nomi
nation, o
"I believe Corwine has been nominat
ed," Dr. Harding said today, "but I am
not ready to admit my defeat until the
official count is made Tuesday. The
vote is too close for me to be beaten un
oificially. Corwine claims the nomina
tion by'l92 votes."
The Kansas suffragette believes that
if she has foiled to get the nomination
is to due to the "short slghteduess of
the male voters.
If Fev. H. J. Corwine, Dr. Harding's
opponent has won, she will support him.
according to her stntement today.
Dr. Harding has received telegrams
and letters by the hundreds congratu
lating her on what her writers believed
was her nomination.
The Woman's National Suffrage as
sociation wanted to know if she believ
led in woman suffrage and prohibition,
lDr. Harding has belonged to the league
since childhood.
"I wanted to write 'rats' across the
I slip of questions and Bend it back to
1 the association," she said, " they might
fust as well have asked fiusnn B. An-
Ithony if she believed in suffrage for
women."

National Housewives League
Warn Bakers "Something
Will Drop"
Washington, Aug. 11 Declaring that
unless congress acts the price if bread
will advance beyond the reach of the
average consumer, the National Assoc
ation of the Master BuUers today peti
tioned the house and senate to impose
an embargo on wheat.
At the same time it was announced
at the office of the Federal Trade com
mission that Vice Chairman Hurley
who left for Chicago last night, had
Bone armed with outhorilv to investi-
cate the proposed increase in bread
prices, agreed to by the Master Bak
ers association.
"The advance in the price of wheat
50 per cent within 30 days, is largely
due to the war in Europe," said the
master bakers' petition.
"It certainly is the part of wisdom
to conserve such wheat supplies as we
have. If no relief is afforded by the
proper authorities, there will Inevitan
lv.be a considerable increase in the cost
of bread. ! i !
"In the name of 40,000,000 users of
bakers bread, we ask an embargo
thrown about the present supply bo ef
fective as to prevent any further ad
vance." .
The petitions -were referred to com
mittees without action. '
Hurley's Chicago trip was not primar
ily to investigate the bread price ques
tion, it was said at the commission of
ficesut he has the authority to take
it up while in Chicago, i'f the action
of the master bakers materializes in
double bread prices.
tiave Great Supplies.
Two government departments today
said they are ready to meet any manip
ulation of wheat or flour the depart
ment of justice and the federal trade
commission. Congress probably' also
would be involved as in the present
gasoline investigation.
"If we find evidence of unfair meth
ods aud price boosting, either by com
nlaint to us. or by our own informa
tion we shall get busy," said Commis
sioner Davies of the federal trade com
mission.
The wheat crop this year is expected
to be 654.000,000 bushels. On the basis
,'of 5.3 bushelB per capita a year the av-
lerage consumption with 7a,uoo,uou
bushels required for seed, the require
1 ment would be about 020,000,000 bush
els. This would leave 34,000,000 bushels
for export.
Last year the crop was a record one
1,012,000,0UU busuels. About zau.uuu,
000 bushels were exported. The year be
fore 3113.000.000 bushels went abroad
but the five year average is only 125-,
000,000 bushels. Experts predict that as
Europe accustoms herself to the war,
the demand upon this country will be
less pressing.
The 34,000,000 export margin this
year has excited speculators, the depart
ment men said, causing them to 'forget
that 75,000,000 bushels of lust year's
crop are left in the hunds of farmers
who were unable to dispose of it and
75,000,000 bushels more are in elevators
and warehouses.
Women Give Warning
New York, Aug. 11 First steps in
a nation wide protest nguiust the pro
posal of the bukers ef the country to
raise the price of bread, were made
here today by the National House
wives' League when instructions were
sent to the league officers in every
state in the union to investigate local
conditions and arouse public sentiment
against fie proposed action. -
"Bread is the rood of tne run ana
poor alike and any increase in price is
going to resultin hardships which we
will .not permit wirnoui a protest,
said Mrs. Julian Heath, president of
the league which includes 700,000 mem
bers. "Preparations for our eampaign are
bein? rushed and if the bakers persist
in carrying ut their threat they will
hear from us."

"We must have immediate action,"
said Stone. "Carrying a strike vote
