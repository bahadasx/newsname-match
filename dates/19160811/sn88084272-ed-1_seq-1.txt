New York, Aug. 11. After deliberat

missioners TVm. A. Chambers, Martin
A. Knapp and G. W. W. Hanger, of the
United States board of mediation and
conclliation, were today no nearer t
solution of the "deadlock" in the dis
pute between the four railroad broth
erhoods of the country and "their em
ployer! than they were Thursday. The
efforts of the mediators to avert a
nation wide strike were virtually at a
halt, due to the fact, it was reported,
that the railroads refuse to grant anv
concessions other than arbitration,
while the men persist in their firm
stand for the unequivocal granting of
their demands for an eight hour day
and time and a half for overtime.
A formal request for a 24 hour de
lay in the negotiations was made by
the federal board to the union men
toda when they assembled to receive
the mediators, and it was reported tha
the board, unless there was an unex

Sharp differences regarding the man

developed at the first formal session
of the national conference here todaj
A substitute motion that the committee
consist of IS members instead of five,
as first proposed, and that the mem
bers be selected by each state instead
of the national chairman, was lost by a
vote or Ai to A9.
An amendment intended as a com
promise was passed, increasing the per-
sonnel of the committee to 11 one
from each suffrage state represented,
and the original motion was then
passed unanimously. Miss Anne Mar
tin, national chairman, announced the
selection of Mrs Wm. Kent of Cali
fornia, as chairman, and taid the
names of the others would be selected
later.
Decide on Hovr to Vote.
A flurry of excitement ran through
the conference hall when Mrs. Dora
Phelps Buell. of Colorado, known as
a supporter or the movement to endorse

motion. Mrs. Margaret Kessler. " also
or Colorado, seconded the motion.
A long delay and considerable con
fusion ensned while a plan for taking
a vote was reached. Efforts to decide
by a standing vote failed because many
spectators had been unable to find
eeats. After several women who un
der the rules of the conference were
not entitled to vote, had been so ad
vised by the chair, the suggestion or
Mrs. Robert Kerr, or Colorado, that
onlv those with badges labeled "Voter"
should decide, the motion was acted
upon by a count or raised hands.
She Forgot to Vote.
"The vote is 40 for and 41 against."
Miss Mabel Vernon, national secretary,
first announced. "Oh. I forgot to vote.
myself." she added hastily. 'The vote
Is 40 for and 4: against " A motion
to reconsider was overruled. Mrs. Kerr,
in the role of peacemaker, then sub
