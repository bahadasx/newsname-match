Candler Misrepresented
Washington, Aug. 7. Hon. E.
S. Candler, member of Congress,
First Mississippi District, and
candidate for re election, issued
the following signed statemeut
here today:
"Washington, D. C. Aue. 7, 1916.
"iMr. G. Odie Daniel, Starkville,
Miss.
"Postoffice at Muldrow, Miss., ,
fourth-class office and under civil
service. Present postmaster was
appointed Jan. 28, 1905, by republi
cans. Mr. Candler had nothing to
do with his appointment or reten
tion in office. It is impossible for
Candler to have postmaster re
moved nor under the rules of civil
Bervice can I remove him except on
charges of incompetency, neglect
ef duty or misconduct duly proved.
Such charges must be made by
patrons of office. No such charges
were made until very recently and
are being investigated. Repre
sentative Candler deserves well of
his constituents and is no wise re
sponsible for this appointment or
the postmaster's retention.
(Signed) "A. S. Burleson.
"Postmaster-General."
"I am for white supremacy.
This is a white man's country
and ought be managed and con
trolled and all the offices should
be filled by white men, and if left
to me all negro officeholders
would be discharged and no
more appointed.
(I am informed It is also being
circulated that my campaign
manager paid Hon. James A.
Cunningham $10,000 (tn thou
sand dollars) or some, amount,' or
promised him I would not run
again, to get him to withdraw
from the race. I have no cam
paign manager and this charge is
false. Nothing was paid Mr.
Cunningham and no promises
made him. Everybody who
knows him knows he is an honor
able man of the highest integrity
and unblemished character and
could not be bought with money
or promises.
"All of above charges are false

hope the splendid citizenship of
the First Congressional District
of Mississippi will go to the pri
mary election on Tuesday, Aug.
15, 1916, and by their ballots re
buke such miserable and unfair
political'methods. Nobody ever
heard me say an unkind word
about my opponents and I never
misrepresented them or resorted
to unfair tactics. If I cannot be
elected by fair methods and by
telling the truth I do not want
the ollice.
(Signed) "E. S. Candle..."
Cunningham Denies
Booneville, Miss., Aug. 8. To
My Friends The charges circu
lated in the district for political
purposes that Mr. Candler or Mr.
Sweat paid or oll'ered to pay or
promised me anything to ellect
my withdrawal from the race for
Cougrcss in this district is utterly
false.
After my withdrawal had been
fully determined by myself and
friends, Mr. Kankin's brother
from Tupelo, and Mr. Sweat,
Hon. E. S. Candler's friend, of
Corinth, were called to Jtooneville
and notified in a similar way of
my withdrawal, aud both ap
peared to appreciate the cour
tesy. Such a silly falsehood is not on
lv an iniustice to myself but the
gravest injustice to Mr. Candler
as a candidate for Congress.
If such methods are to be toler-
a.tP( slander will be put at a
premium and falsehood given an
impetus of thrift aud encourage
ment. This report, industriously cir
culated, is known to be false by
its instigator, and deserves noth
ine but the utter content of all
fair minded peoole.

Cultivate Cotton Late
James A. Wade. CommiJjIorwr of Auric-lture. in
l'rvs:ress:ve Farmer. ',
Late cultivation for cotton is
the most profitable thing you can
do, if done shallow and regularly.
Plow to conserve moisture; to ad
mit air aud sunshine to come into
contact with the soil; to destroy
and prevent the germination of
grass and weeds; to kill insects
and to keep the plauts in normal
health, growing and Iruitiug.
There are live good reasous fol
iate cultivation, any of which
will pay the expense of cultiva
ting aud all of which wijl pay for
the cultivation live times.
1. 'Plowing to conserve moisture
is cutting the pores of the soil to
stop evaporation and keep moist
ure in the soil for the plants dur
ing the hot dry days which are
sure to come some time in the
life of a crop.
2. Plowiug admits air and sun
shine into the soil, feeds nitro
gen to the bacteria that help to
make plaut food available. Sun
shine gives heat and purifies the
soil by driving out insects aud
is otherwise advantageous.
3. Plowing kills grass and
weeds and prevents seed of the
same from germinating. It is
just as necessary to plow to
prevent vegetation as to destroy
4. Plowing kills insects, such
as boll weevils. To kill boll
weevils plow shallow and two or
three times between rains when
weather will permit. Agitate
the plants with a brush or some
thing attached to the plow that
will not break or bruise the
plants. When rain is falling
every day you cannot do much
but think, pick infested squares
and plan.
5. Cultivation keeps the plants
healthy, growing and lruitrng.
To make the largest crop this
must De kept up. It will not
keep up any longer than the next
cultivation is due if you stop.
Be sure to plow shallow and
avoid cutting off the little feed

the food which you make avail
able for the plants by fertilizing
and cultivating. Cutting the
roots seriously is sure to cause
shedding.
Sportsmen Warned
Jackson, Miss., Aug. 1. In or
der to acquaint the people of
Mississippi of his official course
relative to enforcement of the
State Game and Fish Law of 1910,
., A. Jirantley, elate lommis-
siouer. who has resumed duty at
the State Capitol Headquarters,
today issues the following, for
which he asks attention aud con
sideration so as to save trouble all
round:
Jackson. Miss., Aug. 1, 1D1G.
To the People of Mississippi:
Siuce the initiative and liefer-
enduni has been declared uncon
stitutional by Chancellor (). P.
Taylor I have returned . to Jack
son and again opened the ollice of
Game and Fish Commissioner,
and from this date on will see
that the provisions of the law are
enforced, and all violators duly
prosecuted who may violate the
law since this decision of Chancel
lor Taylor.
I hope that since the law is not
in abeyance tnat an persons who
desire to hunt in this state will
provide themselves with a hun
ter's license as required under
Section 18 of the Game and Fish
Law and save me the necessity of
J I At A
naving to can upon tne eounty
wardens of their respective coun
ties to make affidavits against
those who violate the law. .
You can supply yourselves
with the proper license bv calling
upon the sheriff of your coilnty.
All persons liviug within the
state will be permitted to hunt
upon their own lands without a
license during open seasons.
There seems to be considerable
misunderstanding as to the pur
pose and operation of the game
law, aud since this is true I have
decided to spend the next two
months trayeling over the state
making speeches in explanation
of the law, and will be glad to
visit any county in the state and
make a speech explaining the pur
pose and operation of the law to
tnose who are interested.
The office will be in charge of
my ollice ciert, 3lr. Paul Decs,
during my absence, who is author
ized to look after any and all
business pertaining to the ollice,
Very respectfully,

A Believer in Tile Drainage
Decidedly one of the largest
aud most up-to-date plantations
in all of the Yazoo Mississippi
Delta territory is that of Hon. S.
F. Jones known as the Race
Track plantation, six miles north
cast of Greenwood on the Talla
hatchie river.
The Pace Track plantation is
now composed of 3400 acres, most
of which is very tine buckshot
snil. and all but about 300
acres being in a high state of cul
tivation.
This magnificent property has
been mostly opened up and im
proved by Mr. Jones since he
acquired several adjacent tracts
to Pace Track. More than half
of his holdings consist of very low
lands, part of same being a Big
cypress brake and lake near his
present lovely plantation home.
Mr. Jtones believed that he

the most valuable plantation
nropcrties in Leflore county. He
got busy and proceeded with the
work of having tnese lands tnor-
oughly tiled at an average ex j
pense of f 25 per acre, ine great
expense attending the vast under
taking didn't in the least deter
him in his determination to make
Kace Track in reality a model
plantation, and he gave his cupa
ble and progiessivc manager, Mr.
J. T. Kerr, instructions to go
ahead with the work of tiling un
til the job was complete which
aggregated a total cost of $100,
000, and which Mr. Jones consid
ers one of the very best invest
ivents he has made since he begun
fanning as a barefooted boy in the
vicinity of the old county site at
McXutt (now Schlater).
It is well worth a visit to Pace
Track plantation and take a look
at the wonderful developments
made there by Mr. Jones during
the past fifteen or twenty years;
to inspect his tile drainage sys
tem and see its remarkable effects
in reclaiming lands that were
commonly considered worthless or
useless, before being cleared
up and tile-drained; to see cotton
and com growing there now as
fine as were ever grown anywhere
in the world; to view the modern
ginnery and milling plants; to
note the splendid homes for the
owner and for his managers, and
the comfortable cabins lor nis
multitude of negro tenants; and
to observe the superb system
whieh Mr. Jones has inaugurated
in the operating of the vast busi-
ness of this magnincent planta
tion which produces from 1,400
tn 1.S00 bie bales of fine cotton
every year and from present indi-
n.at inns, we believe, win easny

FROM THE PEOPLE
To the Christian People of Macon and
surrounding country:
We have just closed what proved to
be, in ;he judgment of many, thi
greatest revival ever held in our town.
The victory was because of the earnest
co operation of all the people, of all
the churches and of their preachers,
the Ixml helping us, and for this co
operative service I desire to express
my heartfelt thanks.
Dr. .'ones and his people were faith
ful and earnest. Our Baptist friend
joined us in the true spirit of the
Master, bo did our Episcopal triends.
Bro. Holland and his people of the cir
cuit were always with us, serving the
Lord most faithfully. ' It is with the
greatest appreciation that I labor
with Bro. Holland for I regard him as
one of the most promising young men
of the North Mississippi Conference.
His spirit is that of meekness. Hie
zeal surpasses his strength. His
capacity will yield the finest results.
Our people of the circuit are indeed
fortunate in having him for their
pastor and my prayer is that they will
be loyal to him in their sapport and co
operation. Bro. Lagrone is a great preacher
and Bro. Robinson a fine director cf
song, and we shall long remember
them with a sense of the deepest
gratitude.
The Beacon has been kind to us, for
its editor has given us all the space we
asked in a spirit deserving of the
greatest appreciation.
Again thanking everybody for their
most earnest co-operative services for
the Lord, I am,
MoBt sincerely,
E. Nash Broyles,
Pastor.
