WHWI I In
PECULIAR FEATURE
OF PRIMARY LAW
The attention of the voters is
called to a provision of the primary
election law which provides that a
voter may vote for any person whose
name is not printed on the ballot
provided that the name so substi
tuted is not printed on any other
party ballot. Thus a vote for a dem
ocratic candidate written in on a re
publican ballot, or a vote for a re
publican candidate written in on a
dei .ocratic bai'oi wou J be absolutely
void, and the same is true with re
spect to all political parties. There
Be nis to be m J mg in 'ne U-v, how
ever, to prevent a republican from
calling for a democratic ballot if he
desires to vote any part of it, or a
democrat calling for a republican bal
lot if he desires to vote for any of the
candidates thereon.
