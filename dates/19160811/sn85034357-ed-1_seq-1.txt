A SOLDIER'S LIFE
ON THEBORDER
Private Montague Says It is
More Like Picnic Than War?
Food Is Good and Surround?
ings Pleasant.
Brownsville, Tex., Aug. 4.
Dear Editor?Your much appre?
ciated letter of July 27th. received,
and 1 am glad to have the opportunity
to write you about the soldiers' life
here on the Mexican border.
Perhaps you have read many and
various articles concerning what we
have had to undergo. Captain Figgut,
of the Koanoke company, wrote a let?
ter for his home paper which is one
of the truest articles I have seen. To
me, this is just like a big camping
purty, and the military discipline is
only a useful physical exercise.
For the first two or three days af?
ter our arrival in Brownsville, there
was considerable grumbling among the
soldiers because they had to fix up the
camp instead of using their bayonets
on the Villa bandit:;. That feeling has
disappeared now ,and the men are
faithfully and chcrfully carrying oil!
their duties. We have reverie at ?.."?
a. m., followed by breakfast The iore
noon is utilized in drilling and taking
hikes. In the afternoon we have one
hour of skirmit.h practice. Our supper
time is 5:30 p. m., immediate!;/ fol?
lowed by retreat and someli-ne? a pa?
rade. It is always interesting to see
the regiments on parade.
There is very little activity between
the hours of noon and -1:20 p. m. This
is "the heat of the day," though it is
quite comfortable in the shade and in
the tents. It is a treat to see the boys
amusing themselves affer supper
when the day's routine is over. They
play leap-frog and baseball, write let?
ters, have boxing and wrestling mat?
ches, and build pyramids. There arc
several favorite quartets in the regi?
ment, but since the coming of our Y.
M. C. A. these rivals of the nightin?
gale go there to sing.
Our religious services are held in
the Y. M. C. A. building and it is
also used as a place for reading, writ?
ing, and playing checkers.
Our camp is in an excelienc loca?
tion. We have shower baths, and in
our tents are cots, blanket, mosquito
nets and personal articles. It may
sound a bit strange, but we have more
use for the blanket than for the mos?
quito net. The food is all one could
wish for and is well prepared. Our
Captain went down to the Gulf last
Sunday and brough back five large
lish ami two small ones. The five made
a mess for the whole company. One
of them weighed 43 lbs. The two small
ones, being trout, were- presented to
the colonel.
There are approximately 15,000 sol?
diers in the vicinity of Brownsville.
A new regiment comes in nearly every
week. One of the local bankers re?
marked this afternoon that the Vir?
ginia troops had given iess trouble
to the town than any of the others,
and that they seemed to be the most
contented. The native population is
mostly "greasers" nnd a few Mexi?
cans. They arc very peaceful. The
Illinois Cavalry are the only troops
that have had any bandit skirmishes
since we have been here. One man
Was wounded
No one knows when the militia will
return, but I do know that the govern?
ment its still preparing us. This con?
sists of pontoon bridges, additional
supply depots, auto trucks, and the
location of new camp sites. Several
shipments of horses have also been
sent in. ,
Now I am sure the good editor is
anxious to know if I have seen any
alfalfa down here as good as his. Sail
to say, I have not. This looks like it
was a tine country until old Satan
came along and put thorns on all the
bushes and cacti. He likewise caused
horns to grow on the toads, and popu?
lated the land with scorpions and ta?
rantulas. One old timer told us the
people down here were so moan the
Lord wouldn't let it rain until us good
Virginians came along. This rain hns
been a great thing for the stock
raisers in central Texas I am sure
that if we had a company here from
good old Tazewell, there would have
been a flood. But whatever the con?
ditions are here, I hope you nnd your
people will continue to grow alfalfa,
and more alfalfa, to make more cat?
tle and better cattle.
With kindest regards, I remain,
Sincerely yours,
JAMES L. MONTAGUE,

Cm
Lewis' Able Defense of Wilson.
(The Richmond Virginian.)
President Wilson's Mexican policy
was ably defended in the very strong
speech made in the United States
Senate on Saturday by .1. Hamilton
Lewis, the Democratic leader. And
Mr. Lewis arraigned the course of the
Republicans in encouraging strife in
Mexico as severely as he grew elo?
quent in telling of the high and pa?
triotic motives whic hhad governed
the Wilson administration in dealing
with our Southern neighbor.
Republicans strictures upon the ad?
ministration's Mexican policy, Sen?
ator Lewis denounced as "treason?
able." He charged that the clause of
the Republican platform repudiating
interference in the internal acairs of j
Mexico was responsible for the mas- >
sacre of troops at Carrizal.
"Not until the captains of the Re?
publican party shot at the President
of the United States did the Mexican
outlaws shoot at the soldiers of the
American President," he said. The
platform declaration Senator Lewis
characterized as a ?'summons to Car
runzu and Villa to revenge the ent?
rance of American soldiers into Mex?
ico and the interference of America
in her internal nffairs."
The speech of Senator Lewis was
a long one for such a hot summer
day, but it was well worth hearing.
It consumed much spaee in the
crowded Sunday Virginian, but every
American should read it. After re?
viewing the trying Mexican situa?
tion, exposing the selfish policies of
the Republicans, and ably defending
the course of Mr. Wilson, Senator
Lewis concluded:
"This is America. Our countrymen
know to what depths the spirit of j
Americanism had fallen, to whnti
depth it had been plunged to serve
the diplomacy of the dollar and the
statesmanship of the financial strate?
gist. They know that it was Demo?
cracy that rescued Americanism to
this Republic.
When it came to power, Demo?
cracy found Americanism famished,
its body corupted with selfishness,
and prostrate on the earth, it cowed
before mankind. Democracy lifted her
up, placed her upon her feel, breath?
ed new life in her body, revived bei'
spirit, and set the star of hope in
her brow. Democracy buckled the ar?
mor of right about her form, put
the sword of justice in her hand,
and sent her forth to enforce the
right of America as again, t the
world, the model of republics and the
glory of the earth.
Sir, there, too, stands Mexico. As
she has been, so shall she remain,
the stepdaughter of our republic.
Though prostrate by oppression,
stripped by her despoilcrs, and pro?
faned by her ravishers, she shall still
be the charge and the care of this
her protecting mother. We take her
by the hand, we bring her to her
feet, bid her take new hope to the |
days when through our aid, through :
peace, through the encouragement of i
civilization, by the agency of hu?
manity, and through the sanctity of
religion, she shall inherit freedom as
her estate, liberty as her justice, and
to her children transmit the blessing
of a free country, living under n con?
stitution guaranteeing the freedom of
press, the freedom of man, the free?
dom of worship. Upon these she will
build anew to the splendor of her
future, and be welcomed to the family
of nations as a republic purified
through sacrifice, and through the
aid and friendship of the United
States to be at peace with her chil?
dren and sovereign to her nation.
This is the blessing for Mexico to
be enjoyed by all mankind, trans?
mitted through America's decree, now
administered in the dispensation of
justice and liberty by the people's
great Democrat, America's Christian
gentleman, Woodrow Wilson.

SERIOUSLY INJURED BY HORSE.
John Alexnnder, the young son of
Mr. and Mrs. J. Frank Alexander,
met with n painful and quite serious
accident Tuesday, by being kicked by
a horse. His collar bone was broken,
and his shoulder considerably injur?
ed. He was promptly treated, and is
now resting easy and will soon be
well. The littio fellow was helping
drive a flock of sheep on their way to
the depot, and going around behind
a horse one of the drivers was riding,
the animal kicked him with above re?
sult. Little John is game to the core,
and will soon be himself again.
CAPT. I). B. BALDWIN DEAD.
Capt. D. B. Baldwin, one of Blue
field's oldest and most highly res?
pected citizens, died at his home Tues-1
day morning, aged 8-1 years, wanting
only a few days. The burial was had
on Wednesday afternoon, conducted
by Rev. Mr. Trapnell, formerly Rec?
tor of the Episcopal church, in Blue
field.
Capt. Baldwin's wife was Miss Sal
lie Burns, of Tazewell, through whom
his family became connected with
the lnrge family of that name in this
county.
Captain Baldwin was horn in Chris?
tiansburg. He fought through the
war, and after the war was in busi?
ness here with Mr. Gibboncy as a
partner, was treasurer of the county,
a number of years, and in the early
days of Blucfield moved to that town,
and became actively and intimately
associated with the history and grow?
th of that city. He had been active
up to within a short time of his last
illness. Few men in this entire sec
Ition were better known, and his fam?
iliar face and cordial greetings will
be missed.

the Wilson prosperity that has swept
every nook ami corner of the country,
and has placed the Tar.ewell county
graziers and farmers, and the work
ingmnn and business men upon a firm
financial basis to an extent never be?
fore experienced in Ibis country.

We commend to the thoughtful
voters of the country the platform
of principles adopted in its National
convention recently held at St. Louis:
Its record of achievement is con?
structive legislation, enacted under
the leadership of Woodrow Wilson,
is without a parallel; and while the
great nations of the European world

unstained and with every essential

ton, upon appeal from the Police Court
of PocuhouUis, to the Circuit Court
of Tnzowoll, was heard Tuesday by
Judge Kcgley, at. a special term of
the Tazcwell Circuit Court;
The four men did not deem it wise
to go trial here, hut confessed to the
numerous sales of whiskey charged
against them, and threw themselves
upon the mercy of the court. After
lengthy nrgumenls by counsel for the
Stale ami for the prisoners, Judge
Kcgley upheld the Judgment of Police
Judge Owens, of Pocahonlns, to the
extent of lining Adams $25.00 on
each of the Hi Pocnhontns town war?
rants, ami $00.00 on each of the com
monwealth warrants, which were also
sixteen in number. In addition a jail
Sentence of forty-live days was given
Adams.
The lines against Will Smith and
Jack Thompson were assessed at
$li()0.00 each and 110 days in jail each.
Chalmers Ellington was lined a total
of (126 and given sixty days in jail.
The jail sentences upon Adams and
Smith were suspended for thirty days,
in order that they might gel. their
alfairs in l'ocahontas in shape.
It is slated that Adams will have lo
pay the entire amount of lines and
costs of the others convicted in ad?
dition to his own, which will amount
lo about (3,000, exclusive of lawyers'
fees and other expenses.
The court, nlso entered an order
condemning the 2S0 gallons of whis?
key seized in the town of l'ocahontas
from the "saloon" of Adams. The

plicated have agreed lo close up shop,
and discontinue the illegal sale of

During the progress of (he hearing
before Judge Kcgley admissions were
made on I he part of counsel for Ad?
ams of the flagrant, notorious ami
open violation of the prohibition laws
in (he town of I'ocahonlns. Iiis pool?
room was nothing more than a wide
open saloon, where all who desired

The person largely responsible for
the bringing of these guilty saloon
isls of Pocahonlns lo justice is the
Rev. W. It. Ricknutn, pastor of the
Pocahonlns ?nptisl church, who with
a very few others, had labored un?
tiringly for tin1 suppression of Ihe
evil and the conviction of Ihe cul?
prits.
There are a number of other cases
yet to be fried in l'ocahontas, ac?
cording to report, which may he taken

KKV. RICHARD RUSTAVUS MC
LEES.
Mr. McLcos closed his revival ser?
vices here on Wednesday evening, af?
ter ten days continuous service?two
services a day, 10:30 in the morning
and K at night. All these services were
well attended. The business houses
of the town wore closed for the mor?
ning services, and at. night the at?
tendance was large, taxing the cap?
acity of the large audience room of
the Presbyterian church at every ser?
vice, notwithstanding that, the atmos?
phere was humid and exceedingly hot
ami oppressive. ^Jo series of sermons
ever delivered here were perhaps
heard with such rapt attention thr?
oughout, as was this series. The ser?
vices were in charge of Rev. Mr. Ar
rowood, the pastor of ihe Presbyter
inn church, bill all the ministers and
churches of the (own cooperated
heartily, so far as they had opportu?
nity, and were requested by the lend?
ers. As to the results, of course no
one can say. Visibly, so far as there
were any outward manifestations,
the results, so for, have been monger.
That good resulted cannot be ques?
tioned, even though visible results
were not large.
In many respects Mr. McLccs is n
wonderful preacher. Handicapped, as
he is and has been for years, by
blindness, hi? lias accumulated a mass
of information and knowledge of the
Bible, history and countries which is
amazing. He has seen through the
eyes of others, chiefly those of his
pious and devoted wife. Blest with
a retentive memory and a glowing,
fervid imagination, lie is able to speak
with an exactness which is astonish?
ing, and to describe places, cities,
and scenes with a vividness which sug?
gests to the listeners that he surely
must have seen the things which he
describes. And yet, he does not mere
I" memorize other men's words and
paint over again other men's pic?
tures. He is original in thought, and
inimitable in expression. Iti listening
to his discourses one- forgets, and al?
most, refuses lo believe, that he is
blind.
Mr. McLccs was horn and reared in
South Carolina, and one of a family
of seven children. His father was a
Presbyterian minister. His mother, a
Miss Anderson, of South Carolina,
but her people came from Augusta
county. Virginia. He became blind
through an accident when he was 14
years of age, and was educated at
the Institute for the Blind, in Macon,
Georgia. Ho received no special theo?

THE NEWSPAPER MEN OF THE
NIGHT.
lit every large city of the old and
now world there are branches of a pc
cllliar society of specially trained
workers who labor through the long,
dark hours of night that the people
of the world may know.
These workers enjoy but litll? of
the ordinary pleasures of life and
seldom take an active part in the
everyday social affairs of the big cit?
ies, and yet the members of this uni?
versal society are always several
hours ahead of the other folks of the
world in their general knowledge of
current as well as international events
Several hours before the public
reads in the morning papers the in?
telligence of some great, sea disas?
ter, such as the lib fa tod Titanic, these
active workers?the newspaper men
of the night?through the miracle of
the wireless have been in full pos?
session of the facts. When a terrible
conflagration is wiping out a great
portion of a city during the parly
hours of morning, ami whim the pub?
lic is sound in slumber, the newspaper
mull ati' preparing copy and pulling
lie full details of the horror in type,
aid as the average person approaches
the breakfast table each morning nnd
leisurely glances over his favorite
morning paper, scarcely a thought, is
given to the wondrous work which
has been necessary to produce that,
cleanly, neatly-folded sheet of printed
paper. To make possible the produc?
tion of the average morning paper,
foreign newspnper correspondents I
have braved the dangers of the jungle
for a brief news item; war journal?
ists have approached the very firing
line of conflicting armies for a para?
graph of war intelligence; regular
city reporters have hurried night and
day through the streets and various
public buildings of the town for spe?
cial local notes; and, to complete Ibis
splendid work, the night editors, jour?
nalists, and last, but not least, the
printers, have labored at. the cost of
(heir health and strength. Result: a
morning paper containing a record of
lite previous day's strife and strug?
gles of the entire world, und for this
the reader pays one little penny!
At the twilight hour of evening
when even the sun has gone to rest
and when (he workers of mosl other
crafts and callings have ceased I heir
labors for the day and are strolling
homeward in great, multitudes', or
(axing tile capacity of the trains and
street railways of the city, the news?
paper men of the night come out from
their homes und dwellings and go
quietly on their way through the now
restful streels to the great newspaper
plants for beginning their long night's
work. On every side are signs of the
early evening's olfering of recreation
and pleasure und the are and incan?
descent lights along (be streets ami
avenues twinkle invitingly as the
night, workers pass along, but this
pleasant scene is not. for them. They
nave had their recreation and "even?
ing"?or rather they have tried to
turn the hot day into their evening,
and now must return to that restless
toil in the night, in order that, the
world may know.

Sees No Reason Why Chief Ex?
ecutive's Election is Not as
Sure as in 1912?Crops
Good in Russell.
Governor Henry C. Stuart, and his
nephew, Mr. Harry Stuart, wore hero
yesterday to attend a business meet?
ing of the Buckhoril Coal it Iron Co.,
anil spent the day, dining with the
Governor's life-long friend, Cnpt.
lteese Itowen.
The Governor has been at his farm
in Hussell for two weeks, rusticating
and rejuvenating, and seemed in tine
(rim and spirits, lie returned to Hus?
sell in (he afternoon, and will attend
the convention at Uristol tomorrow.
Asked about, crop conditions in Hus?
sell Ihe Governor said (hat the grass,
is the IhlOSl ever, rattle fat and get?
ting falter every day, and everything
is all right. As to the corn crop pros?
pects, he said it is the best Russell
nas had for years. Kveu on ridge anil
upland, Ihe corn is line, a larger per?
centage of stalks have two ears each
than he had ever seen before, and if
no accident, such as high winds to
blow the com down, the yield will he
heavy Ibis year. "How much corn will
be made on your lauds in Russell
this year, do you think?" the report?
er asked him. Of course, he didn't
know, couldn't "give even a rough
guess." The Governor has more acres
of fine laud in Russell than you could
shake a stick at in a month, if you
shook Ihe slick day ami night, per?
haps. At least, he said: "I will have
enough lo do me, as the boys say."
Asked about, the political situation,
etc., he said he grows more and more
confident every day of President Wil?
son's re-election, particularly since Mr.
Illlghes's letter ami several speeches
delivered. "Mr. Hughes' letter of ac?
ceptance and his speeches since have
been without force and entirely dis?
appointing, There is no mere reason
now why Lho Republicans should win
in Ibis campaign than there was that
they should have won in 11)12. What
have Lhey done during the last, four
years that the party should be return?
ed to power?"
"Who will be (he nominee ut. Bris?
tol, do you (hink, to oppose Mr.
Slump?" The Governor replied, that,
he was not informed on the situation,
and had no idea who the nominee
would be.
The Governor is popular here with
everybody, as he is wherever known,
nild his visit:; here are always plea?
sant. Irrespective of political allllia
tion the people say, "lie is Ihe best.
Governor lho Stale has ever had, and
Southwest Virginia bred him, horned
him and raised him, and so far as wu
are concerned he CUD hold his job for
life."
TO SUCCHElTTllS FATHER.
(Graham Daily News.)
If is understood that Clarence
Greevcr is to succeed bis father as
postmaster of Graham. Mr. Groover
lias only served out about, one half of
the four-year term and sentiment hern
seems unanimous that the office should
remain in the Groover family during
(he balance of the term, 'file bonds?
men of the deceased poslmaster, un?
der Ihe postal laws, are required to
lake charge of the office and it is
their duty to name the successor to
Mr. Creever and (ill the vacancy. W.
,1. Kink, Mr. Creever's son-in-law, will
also remain in the office as assistant
postmaster.
Clarence Groover has worked in the
office Since his father received the ap?
pointment, and is therefore well qunl
ifled to assume the responsibility of
being postmaster. He is a model young
man and is universally popular as
well as entirely reliable.
As the department requires that the
postmaster shall devote at least a part
of his time to the duties of the office,
it. appears lo bo the general senti?
ment, among Ihe patrons that Clar?
ence would ho the proper parly lo
succeed his father as postmaster, and
we presume ibis will be arranged for
between the bondsmen and patrons of
the office and others who may be in
authority The responsibility of sup?
porting his mother and sisters will
now largely fall upon Clarence and
he now becomes the head of the
household, since his two brothers live
away from home.
AN IMPORTANT NOTICE.
"The Red Book."
A branch of the National Rating
League baa been organized in this
town by Mr. Allison, as stated in
last week's paper. The object of this
League is to gather from the business
men of the country the names of the
parties who do and who do not meet
their financial obligations, and thus
secure a rating, something on the
order of Dun and Bradstreet. A "Red
Book," containing the names of par?
ties who do not pay and are not re?
liable, in each county, will be pub?
lished. Nobody should object to this.
Due notice and effort will be made to
keep your name out of this "Red
Guide. Do not be surprised or get
mad if your name appears in this
"Guide," for it will not nppear if
you respond to notices to pay what
you owe. A number of the business
men and newspapers of this section
are members of this League.
