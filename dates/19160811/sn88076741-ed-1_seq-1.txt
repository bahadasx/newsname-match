THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Notwithstanding desperate resistance
and many counter-asgaulte bhe entente
allies appear to bo gradually tightening
-.the band about the Teutons,
On the Boiume the British and ^French
»both report successful adv&naes for
•short distances along a wide front. The
^Russians claica very considerable suc
cess all along that long battle front and
the capture of many prisoners. The
Italians are celebrating a great victory
having taken a bridgehead for which
they had been fighing for a year anil
which they claim means much strategi
cally. In Egypt the British scattered
.and defeated a force of Turks which had
designs xn the Suez canal.
The submarine "Deutchland" ap
parently went to sea ithout being in
tercepted by the British ships that were
watching lor her. The other submarine
"Bremen" has not arrived or been heard
from.
There are rumors substantiated by
appearances that the entente allies are
working together to press the German
and Austrian troops on all sides in con
certed action. This if true will doubt
less bring on some very heavy lighting
in the near future. Critics recall
Grant's tactics that crushed the rebel
lion in 1664-5. The .military question
appears to be whether Germany still has
sufficient reserve power to "cotne back."
There has been some very heavy fight
ing about Verdun again this week. Fort
Thiamont has apparently changed hands
at least three times and reports disagree
as to which army now holds. At Fleury
also near Vernun, strong assaults by tbe
Germans were repulsed.

and organization all help to increase
production, but as these things are com
mon and available to all, the gtaeral
average of daily production at -any ptr
Xicular time or epoch will be about *the
same.
Just mow, measured by dollars, human
ilabor ie considerably-above what it .was
a few years ago. But measured by ax
oba«ige.ofiproduct8, the wen in the'ttelds,
ithe men in tbe factories, the men in
•stores and-offiors are trading on theaame
•even terms as they were two or three
^•eara ago. fEaoh classigets more dollars
thas before but each .must -spend more
Jollats oow„
Ht is one of the questions of these
times as to how much longer this infla
tion of dollar values can igo oq, lEvery
day the -dollar .prices of-all commodities
geow higher. lEvery day the workmani
is deuanding and reoeiviog more wages,
notffi9ithstandiQg.it takes namore human
effort toiraise .a bushel .of potatoes.or
weave a yard .of cloth than it did a few
years .ago.
While -the «war certainly has some
effect -yetthat-caanot be the-whole cause.
Soldiers -eat mo more and wear no more
than when they .were civilian^. While
many .producers have through the war,
been ehanged from .producers to destroy
ers yet in this.country at .least, so far,
we have inot seen any real ahortage of
products because we -were short of labor.
We rawed a bum^per crop of form pro
ducts last year and All sorts of manu
factures wefe prosperous.
The great reason of the .present high
priceb is that dollars themselves are
cheapjmu)cheap because they are,plenty.
For this the war is largely responsible.
There are two ways in which war cheap
ens money. First, all the money $pent
by nations at war is borrowed. That is,
it is not actual cash but is "fiat" money
in that its value depends largely t^pen
the results of the wax. The .English
found sterling is worth several cents
less in American gold dollars than when
the war began. When a trader sells a
cargo of wheat to the British he wants
tbe English buyer to give him a little
higher price because English money is
below par. This of course increases the
volume of money paid for days works
for wheat is largely a product of days'
works.
Secood, the war circulates large
amounts of money that otherwise would
be locked up in banks, and private
hands. l.t is like setting one's house on
fire to get warm. For the time being
there will be not only plenty but a sur
plus of heat. Just now, in this way
there is a surplus of money—but it ia
cheap money—and it takes a lot of it to
buy day's works.
But there is a lot of this inflation that
is just wind. After tbe war thingB aie
bound to drop, .Let us hope they will
not drop too suddenly. Some of us who
remember the years succeeding the Civil
War fear a repetition of the same results.
WHY WILSON WILL
NOT BE RE-ELECTED.
Because his Mexican policy, or lack of
any definite policy, has alienated many
votes both north and south, particularly
in the border states.
Because of the weakness shown by his
cabinet officers. For example, the resig
nations of Bryan and Garrison and the
fads of Secretary of tbe Navy Daniels.
Because he has a bitter quarrel with
southern congressmen over the child
labor bill.
Because in his foreign diplomacy of
alternate bluff and retreat he has suc
ceeded in alienating very many voters of
foreign extraction. He has pleased none
His ideas of increase in army
.f
and navy have been changed
politioal exegenoies. '-f*
Because fae favora the free entry
cereals, Jruits, lire stock, eggs, bunar
and all farm products which oome into
competition with farmers, because of tha
high coat «f living.
Because Mr. Wilson is a •ohoolmaster
and nota-statesman.
Because "a good man" needs more
than goodness to make a good president.
£ecause, to say it at onoe andin brief,'1
Wilson is weak, and Hughes is strong,
ana we need a strong man at this time.
WEATHER AND
CRAPS
Two quite.heavy rains in this locality
the past week with cooler weather.
Some:grain has been cut during the
week and'harvest will be in full blast by
Monday nest.
Reports from the fields are
irather pes
simistic. Slack rust and hot weather
blight have damaged the crops very
seriously. Some farmers claim that
their wheat is not worth cutting. We
have seen-eamples.that showed no tilled
kernels whatever in the heads. Oats
and flax seen to be a fair orop. Tbe
grain markets are responding vapidly to
the expected-shortage. The government
report given-out this week shows a loss
of 100,000,000 bushels of wheat-since the
report of a month ago.
The Canadian northwest which has
persistently sported no damage from
blight and rust is now changing.its talk
and admits 'that tbe crop hurt
very badly in.-some sections. But black
rust and hot weather blight are net «eo*
tional or localvtroubles. Both spread all
over large territories when presentat all.
If the war demand keeps up and the
shortage is as bad as it appears at. this
writing, wheat is likely to join the aviator
eorps this fall.
A.BULLETIN*QF THE
SOW THISF.LE.
The sow thistle is doing hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of damageiin
some sections of ."North Dakota. Xhis
weed will permit notning else to live .in
its ivicinity and it is spreading steadily
and constantly in new ilelds. In one
county in this state the loss in land
values alone, because of sow thistle is
conservatively estimated at oyer $9,000^
000.00. Many of our ipeople know noth
ing of this weed and therefore do not
recognise it when it appears.
The Agricultural Committee of the
Grand Forks Commercial Club has is
sued a bulletin describing the sow this
tle and telling how to destroy it. Inter
ested farmers may receive a copy of this
bulletin free, by addressing the North
Dakota Development League Press
fiureau at Grand Forks, asking for same.
ANOTHER ASSESSMENT,
President Townley of the Nonpartisen
League wants more money. Tbe nine
dollars admission fee to membership
don't seem to fill the bill and now he is
traveling the country in an automobile
having meetings with trusted ones.
What has become of tbe 8250,000 already
collected only Mr. Townley and some of
his closest friends can say. Tbe follow
ing is an article that appeared ia the
Cavalier Chronicle last week.
President Townley of the Nonpartisan
League, paid Cavalier a visit last Thurs
day, coming here by auto from one of
the neighboring counties, and addres
sing an audience of fifty or more at the
court house. No general notice of the
meeting had been given, but many of
the league members bad been notified
to be present. The main object of the
meeting was to start a subscription for a
reserve fund, which, according to Mr.
Townley, is to be used if necessary in
cooibiting the 'old gang."
•HUGHES SAYS.
"We are entitled to a standing army,
without taking men out of civil life, as
in the Mexican mobilization, just as
much as a city is entitled to proper
police protection."
That
is
the way the Republican candi­
date for the presidency puts the Mexi
can situation. It is the whole truth in
a nutshell. Why should we call men
from civil life and occupations to do
police duty?
Automobile for Sale.
I have a Maxwell, two cylinder, two
passenger car for sale at a bargain. It
is as good as new, and is a bargain at the
price asked for it. A motor cycle-will
cost considerably more than the price
asked for this automobile, which is
equipped with magneto, gas lights and
runs like a sewing machine. Apply to

ARTS AND CRAFTS
Large Attendance and Suc
cessful Showing. Credit
diie the Civic League.
The Arts and Crafts Exhibition, which
was held Wednesday and Thursday of
last week, was a success in attendance
as well as to the quality, quantity and
variety ©f the exhibits displayed. Tte
old court house was used as an exhibit
tion building, the court room making an
excellent place in which to display the
exhibition of beautiful fancy work of all
kinds. -Show oases filled with heirlooms,
many of great value and many years old,"
were arranged about the room. A cen
tral booth where Icelandic women were
carding-and spinning was a great attrac
tion.
One of the most interesting individual'
exhibits was that of Mrs. W. Magford
consisting of rare old china, stiver and
jewelery brought from Scotland many
years ago. An Icelandic wedding dresa,
handed down through three generations,
embroidered in colored wool and spun:
gold was-on exhibition as was also a silk
costume of 1865 with beautifully em
broidered collar and sleeves of white
mull. Exhibits of unusual interest from
England,Scotland, Iceland, China, Jap
an and Norway were displayed, so that
seperate mention would be impossible.
A room was devoted to the display
|i
il
of
relics and ourios, many of them brought
by the old .Selkirk settlers Comfort-,
able rest and tea rooms were fitted up
for the pleasure of the visitors.
The exhibit from the Feeble Minded
'Institute of -Grafton was of great inter
est, consisting of a splendid display of
industrial work. Mrs. Wiley spoke of
the necessity, of segregation in the work.
Qbarts were used showing hereditary
mental aberration in families for several
generations. A. great work is being done
for these unfortunate children under the
able management of Dr. and Mrs. Wiley.
Miss Julia Newton of the North Dak
ota Agricultural'Colle&e gave demonstra
tions Thursday afternoon on meat
substitutes and .gave recipes for samp.
"She also spoke
of saving labor and time
in the kitchen by easily made conveni
ences for the housewife. Miss Newton
is a very interesting speaker with a win
ning personality.
.-Superintendent Chapell of the School
for the Blind of Bathgate gave a most
interesting and instructive address on
Thursday afternoon, relative to tbe work
which is being done in the school. He
spoke of the need of more universal edu
cation as to the causes and prevention
of bldndness in infanta. The industrial
exhibit was quite marvelous, brooms,
brushes, needlework, hammocks and
perhaps the most beautiful, basketry
made by the students, speaks highly of
the efficiency of the institution, and re
flects much credit upon Superintendent
Chapell and his instructors.
Tbe conoert given Thursday evening
was well attended and the proceeds will
be added to the cemetery fund. Those
from out of town who so kindly assisted
in the program were Miss Nora Forester
of Winnipeg, who gave two beautiful
violin selections Mr. Vierling of Grand
Forks, a baritone singer of wonderful
power and ability, gave a solo Mr. Clar
ence O'Connor of Sjt. ThomaSf who has
an excellent tenorN voice, sang several
selections Miss Ruth Mabon of Laug
don, in a rich contralto voice, sang and
responded to the encore Miss Eva Mur
phy of Neche, favored the audience with
several well rendered readings, which
were much enioyed. The other num
bers on the program were given by our
own home talent of which we are very
proud.
