Federal Mediators Fail to
Bring Managers and Em
ployes Into Agreement.
NEITHER SIDE
YIELDS A POINT
Railway Managers Stand firm for
Submission of Dispute to Arbitra
tion Board and Brotherhoods Re­
fuse to Give up Demands—Men
Growing Impatient and President
Wlson May Intervene
New York, Aug. 11.—After deliber
ating the greater part of the night,
Commissioners William L. Chambers,
Martin A. Knapp and G. W. Hanger,
of the United States board of media
tion and conciliation, were today no
nearer a solution of the "deadlock" in
the dispute between the four railroad
brotherhoods and their employers than
they were yesterday.
The efforts of the mediators to avert
a nation-wide strike were at a halt,
due to the fact, it was reported, that
the railroads refused to grant any con
cession other than arbitration, while
the demands of the men were not
changed.
Wilson May Intervene.
A formal request for a twenty-four
hour delay in the negptiatlons was
made by the federal board to the union
men today when they assembled' to re
ceive the mediators, and it was re
ported that the board, unless there was
an unexpected change in the situation
In that time, was prepared to suggest
to President Wilson that he intervene.
Mr. Hanger, who asked for the de
lay, took pains to point out, however,
that no particular significance should
be attached to the' sudden change in
their plans.
"It must be remembered," he said,
"that the question at issue involves
hundreds of railroads and,thousands of
men and mediators can not arrive at
a judicious conclusion as to the merits
in the case until they have thoroughly
assimilated the situation."
Have Not Abandoned Hope.
He added that the board expected to
continue its deliberations today and
might reach a decision by evening as
to the time of the next meeting withf
one side or other to the dispute.
"We do not intend," said W. §,
&toneu .chief of the Brotherhood of
Railroad Engineers." to wait very long
on the mediators. The temperament
of the men Is suci» that they woulif
not have waited a minute If wis had
not persuaded them to give th^ me
diators a chance. Personally I do not
like to carry the strike vote around in
my pocket."
Since Its organization in 1913 thru
an act of congress and to' September,
1915, the board has considered forty
seven controversies between railroads
and their employes. In every Instance
the board has succeeded in securing
an ultimate adjustment of the differ
ences, thirty-nine cases having been
settled by mediation alone and eight
by arbitration.
A report was current that the rail
road managers were ready to propose
a form of arbitration different from
that provided under the Newlands act.
This was that instead of six arbitrat
ors, two appointed from each side and
two neutrals, the board would consist
of two from each side and two from
each brotherhood.
Ask Congress Bar Strike.
Washington, Aug. 11.—An appeal
to congress to protect the majority
of railroad empleyes and the country
at large from the threatened strike
of the 300,000 trainmen came from
6,000 signatories.
The bearer, Robert T. Frazler, Jr.,
an employe of the Nashville, Chatta
nooga & St. Louis railroad, declares
there are more than 1,400,000 other
railroad empleyes who are opposed to
any strike. They are mainly the shop
and office employes, who are not con
cerned In the trainmen's wage dispute
and yet who, he says, are paid less
than half as much as a rule. He ex
pected to place the case before Pres
ident Wilson In the morning.
Frazier says there is now In prep
aration a" vastly larger petition com
ing from the empleyes of many other
roads. Of the 8.000 empleyes of his
road, he says 6,000 signed the peti
tion
Street 6ar Men Draft Demands.
New York, Aug. 11.—A draft of de
mands to be made upon the New York
Railways Company for Its organized
motormen and conductors has been
drawn up and will be submitted soon.
It calls for a sweeping revision of op
erating schedules, shorter and more
uniform hours and a wage scale of
from 32 to 40 cents an hour.
Schedules in force In Boston, Chica
go, Pittsburgh and other cities, where
working conditions are said to be bet
ter than in New York, furnished the
basis for the demands. The employes
of other lines here are preparing simi
lar demands.

Republicans to Permit Measure to Soon
Come to Final Test.

would permit a vote to be reached on
the administration shipping bill late

Senator Jones, resuming his speech
against the shipping bill argued that
it would meet one purpose for which It
was proposed, and reduce freight rates
foreign shippers rather than Amer
icans would be the beneficiaries.

No details of the tour have been ar
ranged but it was understood today

Flank Attaok On Hughes.
A new attack In flank la to be mads
by the administration upon Charles Z2.
Hughes.
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing have determined to adopt as tha
democratic slogan: "Politics should
stop at the water's edge." In aseord
anoe wlth this decision, neither Xar
Lansing nor any of his aids Will |aks
the stump during the campaign.
They have the view, And will Insist
that It Is the duty of all oltiseiiil in times
of great world strops to sink partisan
ship and uphold the hands oX the offi
cials who are trying to solve difficult
International questions In the Interest
of the people as a whole.
Will Answer Critiolsms.
It Is to be expected the president will
respond to the criticisms made by Mr,
Hughes and that he will defend hla
Mexican policy and his European policy
and recite the achievements of his dip
lomacy. But he will not, according ta
reliable Information obtained, reveal
anything that may be damaging to the
country's plan In the future.
The negotiations with foreign gov
ernments will take their orderly course.
The administration fears they may be
embarrassed by what Mr. Hughes is
saying: that questions approaching set
tlement may remain undisposed of be
cause of the expectation 'of foreign gov
ernments that Mr. Wilson may be de
feated and that other terms, perhaps
more advantageous to those govern
ments, will be obtained thru delay. But
the responsibility for such a delay will
he laid at the doors of the republican
candidate and the administration will
make it plain tha^ It must not be at
tributed by the people to the president's
procedure.
Lansing to Remain Silent.
If Secretary Lansing were to take
the stump It is pointed out that the
whole delicate fabric of international
relations would have to be exposed.
Reasons for this or that step would be
demanded by the opposition, and the
secretary would be forced to reply.

Hughes told an audience here today,
can be summed up In two words,
"dominant Americanism."
The republican nominee defines this
phrase as follows:
"America making Its institutions
work as they are intended to work,
for the benefit of the people of this
country, and to the honor of the Amer
ican name."
Mr. Hughes made a rear platform
speech here. Short addresses from
the platform were also made at Bis
marck and Mandan, S. D. The strain
of campaigning has seriously affected
the nominee's voice. During his
speech he had to stop frequently for
a few seconds at a time.
The party is due at Billings, Mont.,
at 7:30 tonight.
