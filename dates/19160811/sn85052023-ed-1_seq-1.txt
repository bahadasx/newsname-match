BEST CATALOGUE
OF ALL THE FAIRS
Outside Lexington and Louisville Is
sued By Stanford Fair Every
body Boosting Big Event.
Perryville, Mt. Vernon and the
Blue Grass fair at Lexington, drew
boosters for the big Stanford fair
this week. A committee from the lo
fcal K. P. lodge went to Lexington
in autoes and received assurances
that a large delegation will come here
from there, while the west end of
Boyle county and Rockcastle county
will both send many people. Next
week the 'Lincoln county boosters
will make things hum at Brodhead.
All evidence points to the most suc
cessful exhibition ever held in Stan
ford or Lincoln county. Requests
for catalogues and premiums lists
come each day from all points of the
compass. The Interior Journal 3ob
printing department has just com
pleted the handsome catalogue of
this year's fair. Outside of the btate
Fair at Louisville and the Blue Grass
at Lexington, it is probally the larg
est catalogue issued by any; fair in
Kentucky this season. It is hand
somely printed with a blue cover, and
occupies 108 pages. It is indeed the
handsomest thing in the catalogue
line seen here in a long time and is
a credit both to its printers and the
fair. A meeting of the directors has
been called for Saturday at 2:30.
Robert Woods got back late last
week from the Springefield fair
, where he campaigned the Harris &
WnnrJs sfrino- nf snlpnHid trmlps with
t. I such success. He lost no opportuni
sm ties either to boost the Stanford
A fair. The local mules won six blue
$ ties and several reds at the Wash
v ington county fair.
Lincoln county exhibitors took
their share of the premiums offered
at Danville last week. Everyone in
the Danville Fair was a success, and
it is expected that a small dividend
will be paid the stockholders, of
whom there are several in Lincoln.
The floral hall awards and the ring

Too Dry in Wayne
For Citizen There Who Wants Stage
Lines Forced To Bring In Booze.
Monticello, Wayne county, twenty
five miles from a railroad, is suffering
from "an order in council," laying
an embargo on wines, spirits and mal
ted liquors, and B. O. Shearer, of
that city, in a complaint filed at
Frankfort has petitioned the State
Railroad Commission to exercise its
power to break the drouth, says a
dispatch from the- state capital. He
said in his letter that four express
and four freight lines are operated
between the county seat of Wayne,
and Burnside, the nearest railroad
point; but "thru the interference of
a very few of temperance advocates
they have refused to carry liquors
even for family and personal use,"
he adds that "we "desire liquor for
our personal use strictly," and writes
to "know it there is any way to
reach the express operators and com
pel them to make delivery of intoxi
cants for personal use." Inquiry de
veloped the fact that one of them is
a mail carrier and can't deliver and
the other three have agreed not to
handle such shipments. They are
privately owned stage lines and the
commission is powerless to act.
Good Man Game Warden
Q R. Jones Accepts Appointment
In Casey County.
While in Casey county last week,
making investigation regarding vio
lations of the fish and game laws of
the state. District Game Warden, S.
J. Embry secured a County Game
Warden for Casey county, something
no district warden has been able to
do before. Contempt for the game
laws in that section and threats of
"bushwhacking" the game warden,
are said to have deterred anyone
from taking the office. Mr. Embry
took up the matter with Q. R. Jones,
one of the most prominent farmers
of the Yosemite section of the coun
try and Mr. Jones agreed to accept
the place. Mr. Embry has agreed to
co-operate with him in every way,
and as Mr. Jones is absolutely fear
less as well as splendidly qualified
for the place in every way, violators
of the game laws in Casey county
had better look out in the future.
Mr. Embry went to Boyle County,,
where he is spending the week. He
has appointed George R. Sandidge
Warden for Boyle county who is said
to be splendidly qualified for the
place and will make a good man.

time. "Besides his parents, he is sur
vived by his sister, Miss Lucile Crowe
and they all have the heartfelt sym
pathy of a host of friends in their
dark hour of bereavement. The fun
eral took place in Danville Thursday
afternoon.
Sunstroke Proves Fatal
John Seever, son of Mr. and Mrs.
J. J. Seever, one of the most respect
ed families in the Gruenheim section
south of Stanford, died at his home
in Louisville Tuesday as the result of
a sunstroke which he sustained Sun

in the Gruenheim cemetery after re
ligious services. His parents and

TUCKER SCHOOL HONOR ROLL.
The Tucker school, near Maywood
closed its first month of school last
Friday. Seventy-one per cent of the

must make an average of 90 in
scholarship, deportment and attend
ance. The parents are kindly urged

to school every day. They will
jplease remember that all children

er is required by law to report them.

do that during this school. In re
