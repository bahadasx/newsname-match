His Taxes
AVOIDS THE MAIN ISSUE
Brags About His Bank and Says That
All His Money Is Invested in
Vermont,
"TO THIS PEOPLE OP VERMONT:
"1 have read with keen interest the
arraignment ol Commissioner Wil
Hams and feel constrained to enter my
plea of 'not guilty.' There is no bet
ter way to answer the Charge than by
telling the simple story of the founda
tion and growth of an institution to
which I have devoted the best efforts
of my life The Lamoille County Sav
ings Hank and Trust company.
Organized In 1889.
"This institution was organized
Jan. 21, 188!). From the beginning the
one Inflexible purpose Of my mind was
that its funds must all bo invested
within the state of Vermont. For 20
years, and up to the time that I was
elected to the United States Senate,
every dollar of its assets, according to
my best knowledge and belief, was
loaned In Vermont. All importunities
to swerve me from this line of action
were denied without hesitation, and I
confldentally challenge any living man
to show where one single dollar was
ever loaned outside the state during
this period of 20 years.
Heavy Deposits.
"That the people honored me be
cause of my devotion to this principle
is shown by the fact that for the three
and a half years, covering the liscal
years ending June 10, 1908, Juno :t0,
l'J0!, June 150, 1'JlO, and the half year
ending January 1, 1911, approximately
$1,000 per day was deposited in the
bank in excess of tho withdrawals.
Williams' Approval.
"These phenomenal deposits
coupled with my necessary aS.M-ie-.-from
the state, brought about a con
dition which 1 could not well tak, are
oft and acting upon what I Understood
to be the approval of Commissioner
Williams, 1 consented that first (lass
out-of-state loans, if guaranteed by a
strictly strong, high-class Vermont
guarantor, might be accepted.
"When this decision was reached
the advertising 'all assets Invested In
Vermont' was discontinued. I chal
lenge any one to show where, in any
advertisement, the words, 'all in Ver
mont' w ere used in one single instance
alter this new policy was adopted.
"Every advertisement Issued by the
bank was first published in the La
moille News and Citizen and the files
of that paper are open to anyone who
desires to examine them.
Followed Williams' Suggestion.
"Later Commissioner Williams
thought this practice of taking paper
with a Vermont guarantor should
cease, and without hesitation or delay,
his suggestions were adopted
' For several years, as Mr. Williams
states. 1 personally paid out of my own
private pocket from $l.mii to $", a
year rather than have in our bank a
dollar of paper that was not predicat
ed either upon a Vermont security or
a lirst class Vermont name.
"I am glad Mr. Williams has mndi
clear this fact because it might have
been difficult to make I he public b(
neve that I would make so large a
sacrifice to maintain my personal
views with reference to out-of stale
loans.
Out-of-Statc Loans.
'Hut tin- time arrived in October
1!I4 when the board of directors, fol
lowing Mr. Williams' advice, decided
to open the bank's doors to out of stute
loans. I reluctantly yielded to this on
tho condition thai the bank should
complete a quarter of a century with
out loaning a dollar of paper that was
not Ixised either on a Vermont sceur
lly or first class Vermont name.
"Touching the charge of avoidance
of taxation very little need be said
"I Paid My Debts.''
"At the time the law abolishing off
sets went liito effect I owed large
aunts of money. I felt that It was
right that I should sell as much of my
property as 1 could and pay my debts
Among gtiier properties so sopi were
some of my bank stocks. I took what
I believed to bo good legal counsel in
regard to this matter and was advised
that to sell any property I owned and
pay my debts was neither morally nor
legally wrong, and acting upon this
legal advice. I made the sales to which
Commissioner Williams refers.
I have not seen, nor do I now se,.
anything that Is dishonorable In I his.
ir It did not (and It certainly did not)
result In avoidance of payment of my
honest debt.
Money Invested In State.

PAGE S BANKING METHODS
Letters From the Bank Commissioner
to the Senator.
In addition to the statement of Hank
Commissioner Frank C. Williams al
ready printed in The Banner the com
missioner also makes public copies of
letters he wrote Senator Page and
other Officials of the Hyde l'ark bank
in his efforts to get them to obey the
laws of the state. Mr. Williams says:
"In order that the people ol the
state may understand what my posi
tion was long before any political con
troversy arose, i make quotations
from letters which I wrote to the bank
and to Senator Page.
"In a letter dated July 13, 1912, to
the vice-president of the bank, l sta
ted. 'I might say In this connection,
us I have said before, that the policy
of your bank of requiring some of its
dire, tors to guarantee or indorse pa
per discounted is not a proper ono,
and I have expected that you have
discontinued that practice. So far as
indorsements and guarantees Which
have been given for paper now held
by the bank. 1 have taken the position,
which you know, that such guaran
tees and indorsers should not be re
leased upon any of the paper held by
tho bank, but that the practice should
be discontinued.'
"In a letter to the vice-president
dated November lit), lit 1 . 1 said, '1
have just read the latest advertise
incut of the above bank in the Express
and Standard ami am somewhat sur
prised at some of the statements
therein made, lor although perhaps
technically, these statements are cor
rect. yet they are. 1 think, very mis
leading. I understand this line of ad
vertising was abandoned after my talk
with yourself and Senator Cage a year
ago last summer. You will remember
that you very frankly told me that you
had overstepped the law In the mat
ter of indorsements and guarantees of
out of state loans and while you did
not. 1 think, fully admit it. the result
of your statement Induce I tie- to think
that ollicers of the bank had been re-
eivlng what in law would amount to
a commission for placing loans, al
though your method was such as pos
slbly to avoid that charge. My un
ihrstandlng of the result of our con
vcrsution was that the Indorsements
and gnarantci ; of loans by ollicers of
the bank should stand as I hey were
until they were either paid, or so ad-
Justed that the commissioner and the
bank were satisfied to have the In
dorsers and guaiantors released; that
no more business of that character
should be done by tho bank; that the
ollicers of the bank should reduce
tneir obligations to the legal limit as
soon as It could be done without dls
tUrban ce to the affairs of the bank
and that the hank should abandon ad
veitlslng that they made no loans out
side the state.'

WAS SPLENDID EFFORT
The Production of Julius Caesar Was
Credit to Town.
The last presentation of "Julius
Caesar", given Tuesday evening iu
Clark's Woods, brought the theatrical
production of the Public Welfare As
sociation to a triumphant close.
The success or tne previous per
form an CSS had been so marked and
the enthusiasm of the audiences so
great that the Public Welfare As
sociation felt that the extra perform
auce given as an honorarium to Mr,
and Mrs. Klliot should be open to the
public. Certainly it was Iu keeping
with the spirit and aspirations of the
association that the town should be
given, free of charge, an opportunity
to see a play of the highest type.
We may well be proud of the gen
erous community-spirit of the citizens
who made the town their guests, but
we must also be proud of the way in
which the town responded to the invi
tatiun. Some of the very few skepti

DURAND FORCED OUT
Census Director SaYs Resignation Was
Compulsory.
Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 10. Chas.
E. Hughes, replying to Secretary
Redfield's telegram denying that E.
Dana Duratid was forced out ot office
as director of the census yesterday
read to a large audience here, a letter
from Mr. Durand In which Mr. Durand
said that he had told Redfleld he
would resign, but wanted to remain,
and that Redfleld replied that the ad
ministration had derided on a change.
In his speech at Minneapolis Mr.
Hughes said in part:
In my speech in Detroit 1 took occa
sion to refer to the fact that In a
ve.y important bureau, the bureau of
census, an eminent statistician, a man
of conspicuous expertness and fitness
for tho place, had been retired and a
man bail been appointed iu his place
without qualifications for that im
portant technical work. Y'ou must
know how important that census bu
reau is. In the proper collation of
those statistics is furnished the oppor
tunity for many investigators to de
tect important tendencies in our life.
It Is work that must be done expertly.
Now, my statement that E. Dang
Durand was retired as I said In ef-
feet and his place given to a politi-
elan has been challenged by Secretary
Keutteiu. Secretary iiedneiu tele
graphs me that I was greatly misin
lormed. He says: Durand was not
removed or retired, but resigned vol
untarily unasked. 1 was glad to in
dorse him for his present employ
ment." t.. nana uuranci Happens to tie a
professor in the university of Minne

ter which he has written me today in
respect to this matter. He says: "In
asmuch as the truth of your statement
wltli regard to Change in the director
ship of the census has been challeng
ed I think it is only fair to you that I
should make this statement: My
re lunation as director was distinctly
a forced resignation. At the first con
venation I had with Secretary Red
field on the subject I told him that I
would of course resign whenever ho
desired, but that 1 hoped I might be
peinntted to remain as I was much

myself reasonably qualified especially
