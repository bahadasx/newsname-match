WILSON WILL COME TO COAST
THE BIG SQUEEZE
Greetings, Have You Noticed the
- New Lift In Central's Voice?
By Mabel Abbott
Have you noticed that
nice, new little lift In Cen
tral's voire when she repeats
the telephone number you
have given her?
And have you noticed that,
you jnst naturally say "Yes,"
or "That's right?"
And have you noticed, fur
ther, that if you don't, you
hear the number repeated
again, with a little extra pull
on the lift, until you do?
"There's a reason."
It's a new order of the tele
phone company.
This morning I sat at the desk
of Miss Cora J. Nelson, chief
operator of the Sunset Telephone
Co., In the geographical and storm
center of the big switchboard
room in the telephone building at
11th and 10.
"I'll connect you wß,h the
switchboard," said Miss Nelson,
"and you can listen and see how
the new order works."
I took up the receiver and lis
tened, with some trepidation.
"Chief operator," you know, is
the person whom you demand in
an exasperated tone when you
get cross at Central.
I WISHED I HAD EQUIPPED
MYSELF WITH A SHOCK-AB
SORBER.
You don't know how interesting
you Bound, as your collective voice
—the voice of a whole city—
comes sifting In to the telephone
switchboard.
You all ask for the same thing
—a. simple combination of fig
ures, with variations —but you
ask for It with so many person
alities and histories and philoso
phies vibrating through your vo
cal chords.

you comn.anded, briskly.
From s imewhere in the long
line of buqy backs before me,
Central's response come over the
wire to my desk, with the latest
style rising Inflection. "Main slx
three-oh-on-four?"
And "yes, please," you answer
ed, probably without knowing
that you did so.
I felt relieved. The operator
knew she had heard the number
right, you knew she had heard it
right, she knew you knew it, you
knew she knew It, she knew you
knew she knew it, etc., etc. There
was no danger of any complaint
on that call.
But you, that is, you people of
Tacoma, were going right on tel
ephoning.
"Helf6! Central! Hoek-blum
blum-blum!" you demanded, rap
idly.
"Proctor one-one-nine-one-sev
en?" inquired the operator, mir
aculously divining your intention
"Umph!" you replied In a satis
fled grunt.
That call was safe, too.
Next instant you spoke in soft
feminine tones, that trailed off
Into ladylike obscurity:
"Madison one-um-uh-l-i-i-" •
Central had lo give it up.
"What number, please," she
asked anxiously,
"Madison bne-nine-nine-five
flve," you responded crisply, witTi
accented Intervals between the
figures,
"Madison one nine-nine five
five?" repeated the voice from
the switchboard, slsnting per
suasively upward.
"Yes!" you retorted in a tone
that implied you were glad she
had got it at last.
I breathed again. I tblnk I had
a narrow escape from having to
act as court of appeals.

"Hellohellomainthreefourflve

livered all in one chunk.
"Main three-four-five-six-one?"
echoed the operator.
Dead silence.
"Main three-four-flve-slx-one?"
she Insinuated, her tone curling
up at the end like a toboggan.
"Yes," you replied wearily.
I surrendered the desk to Miss
Nelson with reluctance. It had
been an Interesting experience.
"The order," she explained, "Is
Intended to prevent mistakes
from misunderstanding of num
bers. It is working very well.
"But if you write a story
about it, please, pltin.se, don't
call us 'Hello Girls!' We are
not. It Is the public who says
'Hello,' not we."
And come to think of It,
that's so.

It is that says 'hello'—the
telephone operator, or you!

NEW YORK, Aug. 11. —The

the railroad trainmen until 10 a.

Representatives of the train
men reluctantly agreed to the
delay.
Several conferences were held
this morning.
President Stone of the engi

mediators must act quickly.
He declared today that the
trainmen are becoming restless.
"We must have immediate ac
tion, "' he said. "The controversy
with the employers has dragged
for so long that the men are Im
patient."
He predicted that if the gov

the trouble, a strike on the rail
roads of the country probably will
be inevitable.
While the mediators met, the
trainmen conducted a secret ses
sion. They intimated they are
awaiting further word from the
mediators.
The trainmen have declared
they will not recede from their
demands for an eight-hour day.

There arc Da vises and Da vises.
For instance, in Pierce county polities, there is Jinimie Davis,
slick lower-bouse legislator, and Ihcn again there is Walter S. Davis,
senator from the 271 h district.
Jimmie Davis, so far as our memory runneth, voted diametrically
against the best interests of the average Pierce county citizen every
time he opened his mouth in response to a roll call last session.
lie peeped an "aye" for every one of the vicious hills which an
amused state immediately referended at the close of the legislature's
work.
He was part and parcel of the narrow - between - the-eyes, shifty,
reactionary machine that dominated the 1914-15 session.
Walter S., in the upper house, meanwhile was making one of the
few good records established by members of that Pierce county dele
gation. *
HE VOTED RIGHT.
He worked faithfully for the needs of this county—keeping al
ways the interests of the whole state in mind, too.
He is an intelligent man.
His point of view is right. He conceives it to be the legislator's
duty really to represent the whole public that elected him, instead of
the franchise-corporation, booze, machine gang that too many of our
legislators represent.
The Times suggests that you take due notice of the Davises. Both
are up for re-election. There is one of them you'll wish to swat next
month. And one you'll wish to reguerdon.;
