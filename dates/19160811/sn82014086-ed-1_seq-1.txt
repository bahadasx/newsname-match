HUGHES TELLS OF
DEMOCRATIC EXTRAVAGANCE
Says Wilson Administration Has Been
Recklessly Wasteful.
Fargo, N. P.. Aug. 10. Charles E.
Hughes, speaking here tonight, assail
ed the present administration for in
efficiency, waste and extravagance,
particularly with reference to the river
and harbor bill, recently passed by
congress.
"I think I may say without fear,"
Mr. Hughes told his audience, "that
the government of the United States
is recklessly wasteful, shamefully in
efficient and extravagant, a reproach
to the intelligence of people because
of its inefficiency.
"I would like to have the authority
to investigate this administration for
about six months." the nominee con
tinued. "The rivers and harbors bill,
known to the people as the pork bar
rel bill," Mr. Hughes sail, "is largely
monies wasted, as there is no expert
examination to determine what ex
penditures are needed.
"On the contrary it virtually depend
ed upon who influential men repre
senting particular districts and what
appropriations are obtained in this
district and that district for this man
and that man.
"That is a matter of log-rolling. It
brings the blush of shame to the
cheeks of every American. It ought
to be stopped. If I am elected (pres
ident, to the best of my ability, I pro
pose to stop it."
Mr. Hughes declared that the pork
barrel bill of 1914 was "talked to
death by Senator Burton, a republi
can" and that the 1913 bill was re
duced materially because of the oppo
sition of the republicans and some
conscientious democra as."

Other Paper, and Its
Politics Crowds
Out Legislation
PARTISAN ORATORY MARKED
SESSION OF SENATE
SPEECH FOR HUGHES
Political Debate Continued for Several
Hours Republicans Assaults Called
Forth Democratic Defense.
Washington, Aug. 10. Issues of the
national campaign crowded legislation
into the background today in the sen
ate, and virtually the only progress
made with the pending shipping bill
was the reading of the amended meas
ure, sandwiched 'between republican
assaults on the democratic adminis
tration and democratic defense of par
ty achievements.
Speech in Support of Hughes.
The Rood of partisan oratory was
started by Senator Townsend (repub
lican), who made a speech supporting
the charge of Charles E. Hughes that
IE. Dana Durand was retired as di
rector of the census at the beginning
of the present administration for polit
ical reasons. Senator Townsend as
serted that Secretary Redfield of the
commerce department was mistaken in
stating that Mr. Durand voluntarily
resigned.
Congratulated by Democrats.
Several democrats, including Sena
tors Stone, Hardwick and Hoke Smith,
extended their congratulations to the
republicans for "having at last found
an issue" in the Durand incident. Sen
ator Smith added that his only critic
ism for the president and secretary of
commerce was that they did not open
ly remove Durand, because he was a
man "utterly without executive ca
pacity." Civil Service Violations.
Senator Penrose (republican) joined
in the discussion with an attack on
civil service of the administration and
the hypocrisy" of the administration
heads in the Durand case. Ignoring
entirely the shipping bill, Senators
Oliver and Jones (republicans) and
other senators on both sides contin
ued the political debate for several
hours. Senator Jones said democratic
senators in first determining to post
pone action on the child labor bill had
set the .stage for President Wilson to
make a sensational visit to the capitol
and "in a theatrical appeal to senators
have it go out to the country that his
insistence brought about passage of
the bill."
Replies to Hughes' Utterances.
Senator Lewis, the democratic whip,
replying to Mr. Hughes' recent refer
ence to President Wilson's "too proud
to light" speech, said that those who
admired the independent intelligence
of the republican nominee deplored
that he had "surrendered to the yelp
and bark of Blanche, Sweetheart and
Tray in the refrain of 'Too Proud to
Fight,' charging use of the expression
as a confession of weakness or cow
ardice on the part of the president."
''Too Proud to Fight."
"I had hoped," said the Illinois sen
ator, "that Judge Hughes might be
saved from the exhibition of ignorance
displayed by so many lesser but anx
ious assailants of that which they did
not. understand. The expression 'too
proud to fight,' used at Philadelphia
by the president toan audience of
courageous, Christian people, was the
adaptation of an old quotation from
the classics ancient as the scriptures.
Its meaning is known to be that a brave
people, filled with the consciousness of
their right and conscious of their su
perior strength, were too proud to
fight where a concession of what was
right would bring justice to all. The
president presumed on the intelligence
of his audience to understand that.
"I often regret that President Wilson
cannot find it compatible with his
sense of the dignity of his position to
sometimes enter into explanations that
he might demonstrate to the great
mass of his fellow mankind how
prompted by malevolence in some in
stances, and by ignorance in others,
are the series of assaults upon him."
Shipping Bill Finally Taken Up.
The shipping bill finally was taken
up again just before adjournment,
when Senator Jones 'began a speech
on it with the announcement that he
would not be offended at senators
whose business drew them from the
chamber. Most of the members took
him at his word and left.
Senator Jones charged that the bill,
with its $50,000,000 appropriation, was
a violation of the economic promise of
the democratic platform of 1912. He
estimated that more than $750,000,000
in all would be needed to create the
tonnage necessary to care for American
shipping.
ADRIFT THREE DAYS
IN SMALL BOATS
Captain and Crew of Schooner R.
Bowers Picked Up.
Boston, Aug. 10. After being adrift
three days in small boats, Captain
Thomas Kyffin and the seven members
of the crew of the schooner R. Bow
ers, abanded last week in a gale off
the Grand Banks, were brought here

the British steamer Homer City in
great distress and transferred yester
day to the Cape Finisteere, inward
bound from Glasgow.
Captain Kyffin reported that the
Bowers, bound from Halifax for a
British port with a- cargo of pulp,
sprung a leak during a storm and was
battered about by heavy seas for
some hours before he and his crew
took to the boats. They had drifted
far toward mid-ocean, he said, when
the Homer City rescued them.
The Bowers, a vessel of 373 tons,
probably went to the bottom, Captain
Kyffin said.

DEADLOCK IS RAILROAD SITUATION:
United States Board of Mediation and Conciliation Has Heard
Stories of Both Parties, but Were Unable to Effect an
Adjustment of the Trouble What Concessions, if Any,
the Railroad Managers Offered to Make to the Men;
Could Not be Ascertained A Meeting of the Brother
hoods' Representatives Will Take Place This Morning.
President Wilson to be Called Upon to Take a Hand inj
Settlement of the Differences
BOTH MANAGERS AND
New York, Aug. 10. President Wil
son will be called upon to take a hand
in the settlement of the differences
between the four railroad brother
hoods and their employers unless an
apparent deadlock in the negotiations
Which developed today can be broken,
it was indicated here tonight by rep
resentatives of both factions.
After it had heard the contentions
of the workers, and later those of the
railroad managers, the United States
board of mediation and conciliation
was undecided tonight as to when it
would again meet the representatives
of either side. Martin A. Knapp, one
of the federal mediators, when asked
whether there had been any change
in the situation since the board began
its work, replied:
"There is a deadlock on the face of
it. Whether we can change it lies in
the bosom of the future."
Mr. Knapp said the board had not
been in communication with President

THIS YEAR'S WHEAT
CROP WILL BE SUFFICIENT
For Home Consumption and to Meet
Normal Export Requirements.
Washington, August 10. This year's
wheat crops will be sufficient for the
needs of home consumption and there
will be enough left to meet normal ex
port requirements. That is the view
of government officials, who said to
dav the sensational rise in wheat
prices and a correspdonoing increase
in the price of flour,, following the
government's last report indicating a
qrop about two-thirds the size of last
year's, was the result of the market
adjusting itself from a crop of ab
normal proportions to one of much
smaller size.
Experts of the deportment of agri
culture calculate 620,000.000 bushels of
wheat will be required for home con
sumption this year. A crop of 654,
000,000 bushels, as forecast from Au
gust 1, conditions, would leave 34,000,
000 bushels of this year's crop avail
able for export. In addition there was
an unusually large carry-over of old
wheat from last year's crop, amount
ing to approximately 160,000,000 bush
els. With the carry-over of old wheat
and the surplus of this year's esti
mated crop, officials believe the fnit
ed States will have at least 150,000,000
bushels available for export purposes.
