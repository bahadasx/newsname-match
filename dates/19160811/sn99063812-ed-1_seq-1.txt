Vavricka Tells ot Malin
Railroad Boost Meeting
By KAREL VAVRICKA

Kiel Vavricka, Anvjr. Potrasn! uid
M, V Stiistny, from Mulin, made a spe
cial trip to Klamath Falls to interview
Mr. Strahorn, tho railroad builder. Up
on the strength of that conference, a
meeting was cnlled at Malin Monday
afternoon.
After tho Wnter Users Association
meeting was over, tho iallroad meeting
took place. ICarel Vavricka was elect
ed president of the Malin Railroad
Club and M. M. Stastny was elected
Hocietary. Tho conurltteo explained
to nil piesent the main points of the
conference with Mr. Strahorn. These
points were as follews:
That the railroad, if built, will fol
low the west side of Lost Rivor until
Merrill is i cached, and thence over
the government land near Tule Lalto
to Malin; that the road will bo bu h'
only tlirougn mu i-u-upuruuuu ui um
people affected by It; that the people
of Merrill, Malin and south of Klam
ath Falls are to construct the roadbed
for stock In the company; that the
road will be completed and service
effected within six months from the
date when the plan Is ndopted.
Several other points were brought
out at the meeting, such as the cost of
tho undertaking and tha real need of a
railroad to this community. No one
present was scared by the cost, and nil
present felt a keen need of nuch a de
velopment as a railroad,
At a meeting a voto was taken to
see how many were willing to con
struct a part of the road bed, and four
fifths were willing to do their share,
Some were willing to take even a mtlo
of such construction.
The Malin Railroad Club is certain
that the Maun community will be able

This road will not conflict with the
Southern Pacific only that it will run
through tho same alley. The reason
for this new rnlliond is self-evident:
tho people want n market for their
products nnd a quicker means of out
