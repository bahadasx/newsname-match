Tin work dune on the crude

v-ry doubtful whether any of
the road will be put into condi

At the nicotine of the Hoard
held in Deminu about the 1st of
May, Entginoer A liny stated that
the work on thu north road, he
believed could be completed
within thirty days. At the

TRUE INWARDNESS OP THE
VERA CRUZ INCIDENT.
In ths Spring of 1914, occur
rod the capture of Vera Cruz.
Men from one of our iblpi bad
been arrosted at Tamplco and
had been discharged nhh au
apology. Uut our Admiral de
manded a salute, which was re
ruiod. Thereupon the I'roildent
wont to Congress, asking au
thorky to use the armed forces
of the United States Without
waiting for the passage of the
resolution. Vera Cruz was seiz
ed. It appeared that a shipload
of ammunition for lluerta was
about to enter that port. There
was a natural opposition to this
Invasion and a batllo occurred
In which nineteen Americans
and over a hundred Mexicans
wore killed. This, of course,
was war. Our dead soldiers
were praised for dylrg tike
heroes In a war of tervlce.
Later, we retired from Vera
Cruz, giving up this noble war
faro. Wo had not obtained the
saluto which was demanded.
We had not obtained -epara-tlon
for affronts The ship with
ammunition which could not
land at Vera Cruz had soon
landed at another port, and Its
cargo was delivered to lluerta
without Interference. Recently
the naked truth was admitted
by a Cabinet officer We are
now In.'ormcd thai "we did not
go to Vera Cruz to force lluerta
to salute the flag." We nre
told that we went there "to
show Mexico that we were In
earnest In our demand that
Muorta must gc " That Is. we
seized Vera Cruz to depose
lluerta. The question of the
salute was n mere tirctext.

business whatsoever, this funds
practically exhausted, it seems
very doubtful to the Courier
whether we get a road at any
time soon.
There seems to be some dis
sension between some of the em
ployes of the board, and Engineer
Almy stated that the road was
not being built according to spe
citlcations. Where the blame
rests we are unable to say, but
tlii! indications are that some
one is exceeding their authority.
The interest on the bonds
which were voted last Septum
ber fell due recently. The
county funds were not of sufli
cient amount to pass them at that
time, and apparently the only
money available' was" the road
money, which had been realized
from the sale of the bonds. This
year's appropriation of $'2,i.000
had all been spent except
$lS,3lti.S3. Deputy County Trea
surer llepp proceeded to take
the sum tif $2,100 l'i to pay the
coupons presented for the first
six months' interest on the
bonds, leaving a balance of
4,152.-18 to the credit road fund.
hVom whom the authority came
for using the road money to pay
the interest on the bonds Is
something we are unable to
learn.
It seems that the idea was to

GIRLS, CULTIVATE A SMILE
Pleasant Expression Will Bring Young
Women From Ranks of Plalrness
to Heights of Beauty.
Cultivate your smiles unc-ensingly,
trirls. this does not im-nn tlint you
juust sit in utn-et cars wearing nn
insipid jirin. Nut nt nil! It does
not oven menu Unit you must actu
ally miiiIc in the literal sense of the
word. Hut your expression can lie
smiling without your lips being part
ed ut all. If you are thinking about
pleasant occurrences your mouth will
turn up at the comers mid your eyes
will sparkle, quite naturally ami
without nny effort.
This will keep your fnee attractive
and youthful, even when you have
pns.-id the borders of youth iteelf. If
you wish to retain your beauty nq
long as possible, don't form the habit
of letting your lips droop anil nil
your fnee muscles sng downward
wlien ypur fnee is in repose.
Just stand before the mirror and
pull your lines down to get Ihu ef
fect. Draw your mouth down nnd
scowl n bit nnd you will see just how
ugly those drooping lines enn make
you look. Then smile, not artificially
hut naturally, just a little around the
lips, hut n grout deal in the eyes, ami
you will sec how pretty you can ajv
pear. If every woman realized how much
hnrin she is doing to herself when she
sits with her fnee muscles all relaxed
uml drooping slio would try the smile
cure for ugly lines. The smile enn
bring about mugicul results in lift
ing a girl from the ranks of plain
ness to the heights of actual beauty.

IN PREPAREDNE88 THE AD
MINISTRATION HAS FOL
LOWED, NOT LED.
In the demand for reasonable
preparedness the Administra
tion has followed, not led. Those
-who demanded more adequate
forces were first described as
"norvous and excited." Only
about a year and a half ago we
were told that tho question or
preparedness was not a press
ing one; that the country had
been misinformed. Later, under
the pressure of other leader
ship, this attitude was changed.
The Administration. It was
said, had "learned something,"
and It made a bela-ed demand
for an Increased army. Kven
then, the demand was not prose
cuted consistently and the pres
sure exerted on Congress with
respect to other Administrative
measures was notably absent.
We are told that the defects
revealed by the present mobili
sation are due to the "system."
Uut It was precisely such plain
defects that under the constant
warnings of recent years, with
the whole world Intent on mili
tary concerns, should have been
studied and rectified. The Ad
ministration has failed to dis
charge Its responsibilities Ap
parently, It Is now seeking to
meet political exigencies by Its
naval program. But It lias Im
posed upon the country an In
competent naval administration.

acceptance.

Hughes Points the Way
The speech of the Republican can
didate for President was a keynote
speech, Indeed. Not one person in
the great audience at the Carnegie
Hall meeting was In doubt tor one
moment as to just what he meant by
Yorythlng he said.
Ills address was comprehensive, log
leal, clear and all sufficient for the
occasion. There can be no dispute
as to this. Plainly Mr. Hughes Is a
man who "knows what be wants when
be wants It," and It Is the opinion
of political authorities who heard him
and who have since read his remarks
that he knows, also, how to get It.
It was Incumbent upon the Repub
lican candidate to confine the scope
of his remarks to the limitations of
the occasion, but his crushing analy
sis of the shortcomings of the pres
ent administration of the government
Is merely an earnest of what the tone
and the contonta of his speeches will
be when be gets on the stump.
At Carnegie Hall Mr. Hughes ad
verted to every general question that
Is apt to be a serious issue In the
campaign and In language that will
be absolutely clear to every man or
woman able to read be stated his
opinions, his convictions and his pur
poses. On the stump he will argue
those points In detail. As an orator
be Is eloquent, his personality attrac
tive and his marshalling of- facts so
cohesive that hs holds his audience
to the end. Hs makes It easy for
them to follow htm and his points
are not lost.
Thre was nothing equivocal, noth
ing apologetic In the Republican can
didate's speech of acceptance. ' He
called a spade a spade, and the unani
mous opinion of those who hoard him
was that he shot to the center and
rang the bell. The Re b'.lcan cam
paign Is now open, and those who
will speak and write and work for
the success of the Republican ticket
can wish for no more adequato cam
paign document, no more satisfactory
statement of Issues than are found In
the candidate's salutatory.
Preparations to
I Move To The New
i Army Camp Site
i
Several Hundred Men Are Busy
Cleaning Brush Away and Lay
1 ing Pipe for Water. Taylor
Well Showing Stronger.
The new camp site Is beii)(g
made ready as fast as possible
and it will now be but a short
until a lartre part of tho soldiers
now encamped south of the track
will be moved to higher and dr
er ground. The water pipes are
beinc laid to supply the new
camp 'from the old Iloe well for
the present until other wells are
brought in.
The Taylor well seems to be
stronger every time that it is
pumped and will now supply
plenty of (good water for a lar(ge
body of men. The well on the
tract leased by T. A. Hulsey is
down to a depth of about 250 feet
and some water has been do
veloped but it will be sunk deeper
with the hopes of developing a
stronger water supply.
This well is only a short dis
tance from A. G. Deck's well and
it is thought that this well, if dril
led to the same depth, will be us
good as the Beck well. The
(government has the use of the
Roe, Engendorf and Taylor well
at the site at present, and expect
to complete tho Hulsey well and
also drill on the W. C. Miller
tract and Cox tract.
