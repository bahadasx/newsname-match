' Along both gutters for a distance or,. tnree reet or more
toward the center of the street and extending both sides for
the . two steep blocks over which the pavement was laid the
pavement is in a 'condition absolutely dangerous to traffic. It
has waved, buckled, twisted, curved and turned from the curb

IIARTIGAN WILL
CLOSE 2 STORES
PART OF SUNDAY
ominent Druggist Leads
Move to Better Clerks'
, Working Conditions
Joseph D. Hartlgan, proprietor of
two centrally located pharmacies, and
one of the best known druggists in
the state, made announcement today
that beginning next Sunday, he will
close both his drug stores from 1 to 6
m., every Sunday of the year. .
Mr. Hartlgan 's .announcement is
along the . lines of the trend towards
shorter hours and better working con
ditions that has marked almost every
craft In Bridgeport of late. As he
himself takes an active part in the
work of .his two stores, he will share
with his employes in the rest and
recreation that the new (arrangement
will make' possible. .
- "No emergency cases will suffer,"
said Mr. Hartigan. "It there is a
hurry call for drugs and these nowa
days are very unusual the; . patron
will be able to find a pharmacist for
one of pur stores, by use of the tele
phone, the- drug patrons will not be
inconvienced by the , closing Sunday
afternoons. n .
I . believe,", added Mr. Hartigan,
that this Is a move that soon will
sweep over the country. But' I have'
taken the step on my own initiative,
Without consultation with other phar
macists. - I believe' our . clerks ought
to have an 6pportunity for rest and
recreation. The hours I have selected
are those that will offer the least In
convenience to the public" ;
Mr. Hartigan's two pharmacies, one
at Main and Congress street, the other
at 81 Fairfield avenue, are among the
busiest in town. . ' The proprietor ' has
been in the drug trade for 28 years,
starting with the Jennie Hamilton
pharmacy when it was managed by
Henry Powers. Later he worked In
the pharmacy of Clarence Goodel, In
State street, near Broad sreet, then
with W. H. Gardner, whom, he ieft to
become the city pharmacist, In 1894-
Then he came a clerk in the store
of H. A. Dupee, 81 Fairfield avenue,
which now he -owns. He remained
there for five years .then In the fall of
900 bought the Congress pharmacy.
Main and Congress streets, which he
has conducted ever since then. : In

issued the tickets for $1 a chance. The
drawings were to be heldon the 28th
of each ' month at Puerto Cortez In
Honduras and 9,099 prizes aggregat
ing a total sum of $545,300 were to
be distributed each month. The capi
tal prize was $100,000 while the low
est was $20.
Agents of Bove were stationed in
each city and because of the great
number of working people in Bridge
port caused by the munitions boom
this city was selected 'as one of the
most promising station for the game.
According to the police, McNamara
made a frank statement of his con
nection with the game. He came
here from Danbury something ' more
than a year ago, to work as an in
spector in the Remington plant. About
three ' months ago he became inter
ested in the lottery, and finally be
came the local agent of Bove. '
The police assert that he admits
having employed several runners' to
dispose of the lottery slips through
the big . plant. Business prospered
for the lottery here ,and elsewhere,
the secret service men say, to such
an extent that Bove has been cleaning
up nearly $10,000 a month. " - ' '
" For the past 40 days the .two agents
of the Department .of Justice have
been in this city, -and local detectives,
who have been aiding them, arrested

brotherhoods of the country,
and their employers than they
were yesterday. .
The - efforts of the mediators toi

- "It must he remembered," he said,
"that the question at issue involves
hundreds of railroads and thousands -

the merits in the case until they have

throughouttthe day and that by night

as to the time of the next meeting
with one or the other side in the dis
