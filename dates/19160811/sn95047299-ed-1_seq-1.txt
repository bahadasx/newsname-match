It Southern Baptist Theological Col-
re at Louisville, Ky. He came to
iorida some two years ago. He is
preacher of much power and of
."angeiical tendencies. He is not
Jy a good preacher, but he is a
radical man of affairs who will
w how to work in building up a
arch. He is a practical man, and
methiiiff of a mixer, without any

Someone on Monday night during
the meeting of the board of trade
think it was J. L. Burt suggested
that Henry Hutchinson Sr., would
make an ideal secretary of the board.
On Tuesday it was being talked all
along Lemon street in the business
district, and was meeting with gen
eral approval.
The selection of a secretary will be
a matter for the board of governors.
That is the only office filled by the
governors. It is the only salaried of
fice. The president, vice presidents,
and the governors themselves are
elected in open meeting by members
of the board of trade.
Next Monday night the board of
trade will hold a special session for
the purpose -of making nominations
for the various offices. Three out
going members of the board of gov
ernors are to have their places filled.
Under the constitution they are ineli
gible to re-election. Messrs. Burt,
Fred Merrill and R. E. L. Mann are
holdovers.
At the next regular meeting the
election will take place. That will be
on Monday evening the 21st inst.
Mr. H. F. Leeks has only been
president of the board a short time,
to fill a vacancy. He has made a
splendid presiding officer and would
not have opposition to re-election pro
vided he can be prevailed on to take
the place. Usually business men of
Mr. Leeks' calibre don't have the time
to devote to the work; it requires too
much sacrifice. But the board of
trade needs revivification, and Mr.
Leeks, more than any man we can
bring to mind, is the one to do the
trick he and a wise selection of men
to fill out the expirations on the board
of governors and then the wise se
lection by the governors of a secre
tary. Mr. Hutchinson has many qualities
to commend him for the position of
secretary.
He is a Putnam county man, and a
Floridian by birth. He has lived in
Putnam county for 50 years. He has
been a successful orange grower and
farmer. He has a broad acquaintance
throughout the State and he knows
the county, its soils anil its men, as
well as the possibilities for advanced
methods in soil cultivation. He is a
cultured gentleman and if there is a
better mixer, or a man who can beat
him in impregnating his own ideas
and enthusiasm regarding the future
of Putnam county and Palatka into
the strangers who are coming
amongst us always, we don't know
who that man can be. Hutchinson is
for a Florida advance along all ap
proved lines. He would never be
satisfied to let well enough alone; he
wants to do better.
The Palatka News can endorse the
proposition to make Henry Hutchin
son secretary of the board of trade
with enthusiasm.
Registration Books Open.
The registration books for the gen
eral election will be open each Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday until
the second Saturday in October, at the
Court House in Palatka. The pre
.t lmnks will tro out the first Mon
day in September and will be open
by precinct registration oineers uiun
the second Saturday in October. Su
pervisor of Registration Tetermann
urges all voters to remember that
registration for a general election is
ouite a different thing than that for
the primarv. That was a party af
fair, this is for an election, and if not
alreadv registered for a general elec
tion, you must do so while the books
are open.
Miss Lilian Honored.
Miss Kate Lucas who left Palatka
on Wednesday will go first to Rich-
I niond, Va., tor a lew ciays.
ifore leaving Miss Lucas received a
letter from the secretary of the
I Southern Progressive Millinery Crowd
"You have been chosen by the b.
P M C. which meets in Richmond,
August 10th to l.'.th to represent your
ti, stnti.. This is a live-
! wire meet which will include domon
! strations of every new fad and fan
I cv in the millinery field. Expert
designers of the highest character
i with actual Parisian training will be
; in attendance." Miss Lucas accept
! ed the invitation.
I On leaving Richmond, Miss Lucas
! will go to New York to study the

I panied by Miss Louise Boyd.
At the meeting of the county com
missioners on Tuesday, the bid of W.
L. Slaton & Co., of Toledo, Ohio, who
offered $81,011.49 for bonds of the
Rodman, Orange Springs road tax dis
trict having a par value of
$80,;i50, was accepted and the bonds
were all regularly signed up and
turned over to the bank here for de
livery. Late Wednesday afternoon the fol
lowing telegram was received from
Slayton & Co.:
"Chairman Board of County Com
missioners, Palatka, Fla. Telegram
received. On return to the city Mr.
Slayton discovered that the premium
bid should have been a discount.
Sorry, but under circumstances can
not use bonds unless premium bid is
converted into discount bid of same
amount. It will be satisfactory to
us if you award bonds to next higher
bidder.
"W. L. SLAYTON & CO."
This telegram placed a sort 'o
damp rag on those who had been re
loicing over the sale of these bonds.
The price was considered fair.
President R. F. Adams of the East
Florida Savings & Trust Co., when
asked if the premium price bid for
the bonds was not excxellent, said;
"Well, it's a fair price." And it
was a fair price, but
The telegram was turned over to
Attorney A. H. Odom of the board
who asked telegraphic advice of the
New York bond experts.
Slavton & Co. sent with their bid
a certified check for $2,000, which
the board will probably keep as pro
vided in the advertisement for bids.
The bid of Slayton & Co. was regu
larly made and accepted, and the
bonds signed and delivered to the
bank as requested.
The board spent some time on
Thursday afternoon considering this
matter, then finally decided to hold
Saavton & Co., to their original bid.
The" $2,000 will be declared forfeited
to the county unless the purchase is
consummated.

The steamer Crescent will carry

Delinquent Tax Sale.
On Monday Tax Collector Hancock
sold the various delinquent tax lands
of the county which had been legally
nili.-ort-wpfl tile nvevious thirty (lavs in
the Palatka News. There was quite
a crowd present at tne sale, nut iew
buyers. Mr. Hancock states that 80
nor cent of the lands advertised were
turned over to the State.
May Try it in Palatka.
"A band of determined citizens"
served notice to leave the county on
some persons up around Tallahassee,
who were recruiting laborers for
northern industries. There is a law
on the statute books of Florida cov
ering the matter of enticing labor,
and it seems that this might have
been successfully invoked instead of
the anarchistic movement hinted at,
However, when a candidate for Gov
ernor boldly proclaims from the
stump that should he be not declared
elected in November, he will raise a
l.i rd of 10.1)00 men and march to the
capital and take possession of the Gov
c.Tior's mansion, it is not to be won
dered at thi-.t disrespect for the law

Mr. Chesser Addresses Meeting.
Hon. James M. Chesser of Hollis
ter who was in the city Monday at
tended the board of trade meeting
that evening and was an ini.eresi.eii
listener to the business of the meet
ing. I But he was something else. Ho
made an interesting address. Be
fore the meeting closed Mr. Chesser
was called on and responded with a
nice, entertaining little talk on the
importance of co-operation among
farmers. His address was listened
' o with interest and the speaker was
heartily applauded at its conclusion.
Mr. Chesser is one of the oldest
farmers in the county, a Confeder
ate veteran and has alroady beaten
' the four score mark by several years.
Henis Gets Deserved Compliment.
ttorncv Williams of Gainesville
' wa-, in the city on Monday represent
i ing the Reverend Sidney J. Catts, gu
bernatorial candidate. Mr. W illiams
i was simply getting the accurate pre
cinct returns on governor from the
i fillv sheets, and in the getting of
I which ho complimented Registration
i Officer Petermann very highly for
I the orderly manner in which the rec-
I l . 'lnnt nrwl the fact that tllC".'
orus nvi 4
were all under lock and key. And
it's a fact, too, Petermann does keep
his records in an orderly manner, and
can furnish the desired information
in a instant of time.
Mr. Williams expressed himselt
ouite satisfied with the recount in this
county. There were no hooks upon
which he could hang a charge of
fraud. 1
Col. G. Loper Bailey, who is some
times refened to as "The Sick Man
of Palatka," but who is in reality one
of the city's most far-seeing and ven
tursome business men, on Tuesday
asked for and received from the board
of county commissioners a franchise
which has startled some of the
Whittlers of Sleepy Hollow.
Mr. Bailey owns Georges Lake, a
magnificent sheet of clear spring wa
ter on the border of Clay county
north of Baywood. He has long sug
gested that the city of Palatka ought
to buy this lake and pipe its waters
to this city for beverage and other
domestic purposes, but the city would
not.
The lake is in the hills, and there
is a fall of considerable dimensions
toward Etoniah creek. It has there
fore occurred to this far-sighted gen
tleman that this fall could be utilized
for purposes of generating an electric
current which, had he the franchise,
he could distribute for lighting and
power purposes to all the people of
the county.
Now Mr. Bailey is in position to do
this.
On Tuesday Mr. Bailey addressed
the following letter of application to
the board of county commissioners:
"The Honorable Board of County
Commissioners, Palatka, Florida,
Gentlemen:
"Will you kindly grant to me, my
successors and assigns, the right and
privilege to erect poles along the pub
lic roads in Putnam County, Florida
and to string thereon wires and other
necessary construction to transmit
electricity or electric current from one
point to another within the said Coun
ty. It being understood that same
shall not be so set as to obstruct or
interfere with the common use of said
roads or highways.
"Your attention is called to Section
2820, Florida Compiled Laws, 1914,
wherein authority is granted to tele
graph or telephone companys to erect
poles, wires and other fixtures for
telegraph and telephone purposes, in
dependent of the action of the Coun
ty Commissioners. No such right is
conferred on companies or individuals
to eriVt poles, wries, etc., for the
transmission of electricity, and there
fore the right to grant such privilege
rests entirely with the County Com
misioners. "Yours faithfully,
"G. LOPER BAILEY."
G. Loper Bailey will more than like
ly, with this franchise in his inside
pocket, proceed to organize a compa
ny that will soon distribute the elec
tric fluid into the "by ways and
hedges" and small hamlets of the
county, and the citizens thereof will
rise up and call him blessed.
The News isn't doing that now; jt
is simply saying that Mr. Bailey is
wise and fars'ighted in his generation,
and that his successors and assigns,
whoever they may be, will rise up and
say he was shrewd and far-seeing
snd enterprising, and that when he
had a thing, be it a lake or a tax cir
tificate, he generally looked it over
from all angles before discarding it.
If the thing had any present or pros
pective good points, he saw them, and
either pressed them into instant use
or laid them aside for future exploitation.
Republican Bosses to Meet.
Oil. George E. Gay of this city,
who is one of them, is authority for
the information that the Republican
Stan; Executive Committee of Florida
will meet in this city on Friday, Au-eu.-t
18th, at 11 o'clock in the morn
ing. The republicans are preparing'
for an agressive campaign in Florida
tlii-; year. They have nominated a
strong man for governor, Banker Al
len of Key West.
Mrs. Pedrick Dies.
Mrs. W. J. Pedrick, Jr., wife of
the secretary of the Florida Farms &
j Hon ec, Inc., of this city, died in New
j Yoi k last Tuesday night, following
! an peration at one of the city hos
' minis.
j' Mrs. Pedrick was a young and
: most charming woman, who, during
the few months of her residence in
Vii' -itka, had greatly endeared her
self to a large number of friends.
She left Palatka last spring to spend
the summer north, and few here
knew of her illness. Her premature
iii :'t!i has cast a shadow over the so
! ci i! circle in which she moved here,
; and great sympathy is felt for the
bereaved husband.

OFFICE OF J. SLAlxiK SMITH.
Green Cove Springs, July 31st, 1916.
Hon J. M. Gornto, Mayo, Fla.
Dear Sir: Owing to the unusual
political conditions now existing in
our great State the question natural-
lyy arises: Are we going to permit
the Democratic party to be split up
and torn asunder and allow the Re
publican or an Independent candidate
to be elected Goveror of b lorida .'
We must not be too sanguine and sit
idly until it is too late. The Repub
lican party, observing present condi
tions, is beginning the most deter
mined effort it has made in a great
many years to elect Mr. Allen and
an Independent named Mitchell, who
is amply supplied with finances, is
taking advantage of the opportunity
and launching a most aggressive cam
paign. The situation is further ag
gravated by the undemocratic action
of Mr. Knott who was defeated in the
primary and is now trying to get into
the fight as a candidate, which he
hopes to do by the questionable and
irregular methods now so well known.
Therefore, it behooves us, as true
and loyal Democrats, to arouse to the
dangers that confront our party and
rally to the support of the Democrat
ic nominee, Hon. Sidney J. Catts, and
by organized and concentrated effort,
elect him Governor on Nov. 7, by a
record-breaking majority. At the
same time we should condemn with
our voices and crush by our activities
all questionable and improper meth
ods that are being used to split the
party and destroy the integrity of
the ballot.
In view of the foregoing and for
the purpose of more effectively meet
ing the demands of the situation, I
am, with the approval of Mr. Catts,
calling upon you as a loyal Democrat,
to undertake at once the organization
of a Catts Democratic Campaign
Club in your community so that the
voters may be organized for action
and enabled by this means to carry
forward the work of the campaign
and meet the unfortunate conditions
that now exist, or may develop, and
as the time approaches arrange for a
fair election and a correct count. Wa
want to get the State organized as
rapidly as possible so I would be glad
if you would enlist the aid of others
of your fellow citizens and form a
club at once.
I will be pleased to hear from you
promptly.
Y'ours faithfully,
(Signed) J. S. SMITH.
To this letter Mr. Gornto replied
as follows:
Mavo, Fla., Aug. 4, 1916.
Mr. J. S. Smith,
Green Cove Springs, Fla.
Dear Sir: Y'our circular letter,
dated July 31st, is before me, and in
reply to same will say, that while I
joined with you and others in the
fight against what is known as the
Sturkie Resolutions, I cannot join in
the organisation of Catts club, neith
er do I concur with the expressed
views of your letter. In fact, to be
perfectly frank with you, I cannot
agree with your statement that the
methods now being used by Mr.
Knott are "questionable and irregu
lar;'' on the contrary, I consider them
legal and legitimate and that he is
acting entirely within his legal
rights and privileges.
I do not, personally, consider Mr.
Catts or anyone else, as being the
kind of man we need for Governor
I who, in view of the absolutely proven
' irregularities in the count of the sec
ond choice votes in the recent pri
mary, would be willing to accept the
nomination without an honest recount
of those votes. His declaration that
he intends to run in the general elec
tion, regardless of the result of the
proceedings now in progress, puts
him out of the Democratic party, and
stamps him as unreliable in any way.
In meeting the requirements of the
primary law, he made oath that he
would support the nominee of the par
ty: by declaring that he will run re
gardless of results, stamps him as a
man who has no regard for his oath,
or his word, for that matter. I can
j not support such a man; it will be
' a very bitter pill for me to vote for
him even if, at the end of these pro
ceedings, he is declared the Democrat
ic nominee.
The only questionable methods that
I know of being used jn the entire
i campaign were used by Mr. Catts
I himself; I am of the opinion that
! even Mr. Allen is a better Democrat
i than is Mr. Catts; I certainly have
more respect for him and his hon
i esty.
! I would suggest that, as a "loyal
I Democrat," you wait until the result
of the recount is compiled and de
I dared before organizing any kind of
a cluh. it Mr. I atts in the lecral
nominee, there will be no need of
Catts Club, as he will have the sup
port of all "Loral Democrats," even
including Mr. Knott, the truest of
Democrats, for Mr. Knott, unlike Mr.
Catts, will not be in the race unless
Chairman George P. Raney of Tam
pa of the State Democratic Executive
Committee has issued the following
call for a meeting of the committee
on the 24th inst, at Jacksonville:
"A meeting of the State Democratic
Executive Committee of Florida is

ville, Florida, in the Seminole Hotel,
at 10:30 in the forenoon on Thurs
day, the 24th day of August, A. D.,

Wm. Miller Dies Suddenly.
Most of you knew William Miller
of Keuka. Ho was a big, genial
gentleman who made frequent busi
ness visits to this city from his
home at Keuka, near where he was
engaged in getting out ties for the
A. C. L. Mr. Miller was in Palatka
on Monday, leaving for home on the
evening train.
Next morning report came that he
was dead. Mr. Miller and a Mr.
Gornto were on their way to the tie

out with Sheriff Kennerly and on
viewing the body said that he had
died of natural , causes, probably
heart failure.
Mr. Miller was 53 years of age
and leaves a wife and four children,
besides a large circle of friends in
Palatka and other points in West
Putnam.
Welaka Lady Dies in Jacksonville.
Mrs. Louis I. Stephens, of Welaka,
for years a highly esteemed resident
of Jacksonville, died in a hospital in
that city Sunday morning following
an operation. The deceased was
stricken seriously ill two weeks ago
and was taken there for treatment,
accompanied by her son, P. V. Steph
ens, of New Y'ork.
Louis I. Stephens, husband of the
deceased, died about eighteen months
ago. He was for many years a prom
inent jeweler of Jacksonville. Grief
over the death of her husband hasten
ed the death of his widow.
Mrs. Stephen was originally from
New England. She married Mr.
Stephens thirty-eight years ago and
had been a most devoted wife and
mother. Besides her son, she is sur
vived by a brother, L. P. Varnum, of
Portland, Me.
Mrs. Stephens, before her marriage,
studied medicine at Vassal1, but upon
her marriage, she abandoned the idea
of a professional career. She gave
much of her time to the task of as
sisting her husband in his business.
All her life she was a devoted Chris
tirn church worker.
The interment was made in Welaka.
Pretty Wedding Ceremony.
The marriage of Miss Bessie Le
Hardy, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.
A. Lellardy of this city, to Mr. Benj.
B. Dancy was a most charmingly
beautiful ceremony of Wednesday af
ternoon at St. Marks church. The
ceremony was at 5 o'clock. There
was a beautiful floral bell hanging
just in front of the altar, and in other
ways the church was most artisti
caliy decorated. Rev. William Wyl
lie, archdeacon of the diocese of Flor
ida, and the bride's former pastor,
performed the ceremony which made
this popular young couple one. Mrs.
D. J. Caughlan presided at the organ
and the bridal party entered during
the rendition of the Brial Chorus
from Lohengren. Miss Grace Urie
renered two beautiful solos.
The bride entered on the arm of
her father and was met at the altar
by the groom. The church was
crowded with the friends and rela
tives of the happy couple.
The bride wore a charming going
away coat suit of navy blue taffeta
trimmed in gray and wore gray shoes.
Immediately after the ceremony the
happy couple left with the groom's
cousin, Mr. Edward Dancy of Jack
sonville in a motor car for that city,
from where they will take a short
bridal trip.
These young people are well-known
and greatly admired by a host of
friends in this city and all will wish
them a long and happy wedded life.
