H Till-, CONVENTIONS.
A ,u,w t'lc cPi,')''ca,,s 'iavo
fl held their State and Congrcss-
H innal conventions, and have select-
H ed their standard hearers for the
H coming election, The results are
H not without .surprises, hut on the
H whole we feel to congratulate the
H party upon its choice. Senator
H Sutherland was nominated to sue-
H cecd himself as United States Sen-
H a tor, which will meet with popular
H favor from the members of the par-
H ty. Judge Straup is also nominated
H to succeed himself on the supreme
H bench, where he has made an en-
H viable record. The choice for gu-
H bernatorial honors fell upon Nephi
H I,. Morris, after all, and as the plat-
H form adopted must be understood
H to reflect the temper of the conven-
H tion on the question of prohibition
Hj and other progressive legislation, it
H can be taken for granted that the
H reports that have been circulated to
H the effect that Mr. Morris was the
H second choice of the liquor element,
H were without foundation in fact.
H It is apparent from the way Go-
H ernor Spry's supporters remained
H with him to the last that they en-
H tertaincd no such opinion of Mor-
H Mr. Morris has the reputation of
H being a progressive, clear-headed
H business man, and the only criticism
H we hear of him is that lie has been
H rather changeable in his political
H affiliations. To this his friends
i answer that his politics arc founded
H iupon certain progressive ideas and
H principles and that when he saw no
H chance for such principles to pre-
H vail in the old party, he affiliated
H with such parties as seemed to
H promise support for such princi-
H pics.
H And it must be admitted that
H there is a vast difference between
H changing one's politics merely to
H obtain office, and affiliating with
H another party for the sake of ob-
H taining relief from a benighted and
H corporation ridden state of affairs.
H One thing seems certain: a new
H era has been ushered in for Utah
H in a political sense, and the old
H Spry and Whisky regicme that has
H held Utah fettered and enthralled
H for the past six or eight years, is
H at an end. The rank and file of the
H Republican party have arisen in
H their power and majesty and have
H served notice that the people and
H" not money and whisky, arc supreme
H in this state. Let future politicians
H profit from the experience of Gov-
H ernor Spry in this regard. Spry
H made his choice between thepco-
H pic and the wealth and evil iuflu-
H ence of alcohol, when he chose to
H' annul the will of the masses and the
H ' action of the Legislature, and he
' lost. The so called "Greater Bus-
H mess" alliance were unable to de-
H . liver the goods, and Spry goes
H down into history as a defeated
rhnmninti nf vim.
H And yet Spry was not such a
H( bad governor, lie gave more at-
H tention to the outlying districts
H than any governor has done since
H the days of Brigham Young, and he
H was a good booster for good roads
H and other things essential to the
H well-being of the people. Rut he
H overshadowed all these good deeds
H when he took the dispicablc means
H he did of thwarting the dearest
H wish of his people, and with a Ju-
H das kiss betrayed them into the
H hands of their enemies.
H So much for the governor.
H We regret sincerely the defeat of
H our friend Jesse D. Jewkes for the
H office of Secretary of State. Jukes
Hj is one of our most competent and
H conscientious public officials, and
H was deserving of another term.
H?, Not that we have the slightest rea-
H son to doubt that Lincoln G. Kel-
H ; ley will ably administer the affairs
WB of the office, but we cannot help
H ' feeling that Mr. Jukes was descr-
H ing of the place.
H In Harold Fabian, from all ac-
H counts, the party has secured an
H exceptionally strong candidate for
iQ the office of Attorney General. Mr.
KB Fabian is receiving the endorsement
tB l of many influential Democrats as
3H well as the members of his own par
IB V ' Most heartily and sincerely we
H congratulate Mr. T. C. lloyt upon
H his successful race for the nomina-
H tion as Congressman from this dis-
H trict. Mr. Hoyt is a southern Utah
H product, who has made good in the
H Forest Service and other lines and
WjL".- ;
1 1
is well qualified for the position,
Joseph How :ll lias made a good
Congressman, but lie' has held the
office a good many terms now, and
klu ir.j'tv'n of a little new blood,
with new ideas and understand
ings should be attended with good
results,
Likewise we wish to congratu
late the Republicans of the Second
district upon their nomination of
Charles R. Mabey, of Hountiful, as
their standard bearer in the coming
election. Mabey is a tip-tup fel
low, clean as a new pin, and an
able speaker and advanced thinker.
1 f elected he will be heard from in
the halls of Congress. For several
years he was a teacher in the B. N.
S. at this place, and he has many
acquaintances and friends in south
ern Utah.
Taken as a whole, we believe that
the Republican party of Utah has
little need to apologize for the per
sonnel of their ticket.
The convention was animated, to
say the least, but not more so than
it was expected to be.
The Democrats will meet at Og
den next week to name their stand
ard bearers.
C INCF the agitation of the sugar
- question, which so far as we
know originated with Tin-: Rkcoud,
has waxed somewhat warm, there
has been an increase authorized in
the price to be paid farmers for
their beets, and now comes the an
nouncement of a drop of 30c. per
sack in sugar. This in the face
of the fact that a large warehouse
full of sugar in the east took fire
and burned up last week, and the
additional fact that the fruit sea
son, during which period the price
of sugar usually reaches its highest
mark, is here.
This much has been accomp
lished by an aroused public senti
ment, fostered and supported by
one daily paper and two or three
weekly papers, which have had the
courage and independence to take
up the cudgel in behalf of the peo
ple. The reduction in price is not
much, but the fact that the price
has not advanced despite all the
conditions which would ordinarily
have effected such increase, is con
siderably more.
Yet the fight has oily com
menced, and so far as this paper is
concerned, will not be abandoned
until the people of Utah, where
the sugar is produced, obtain at
least as good a price as they do m
the east.
The retail price of sugar in Chi
cago for July and August, as pub
lished in the grocery catalog of
Sears, Roebuck & Company, was
$7.44, or $2.56 per hundred less
than it was in Cedar City. This is
for beet sugar, which is produced
within 200 to 300 miles of us, and
must be freighted 3,000, or there
abouts, to Chicago. If the recent
drop of 30 cents per bag was gen
eral throughout the country, the
price of the Chicago firm above
mentioned, will go down with the
rest.
Our object in quoting the mail
order house's price on sugar is not
to induce people to send cast for
their sugar and other groceries,
which we strongly advise against
doing, but to let the people see how
they arc being discriminated a
gainst by the Utah Sugar crowd ;
with a view to arousing public sen
timent for still further reforms,
which we can certainly get if we
timply insits upon them and keep
after them.
One ot the leading sugar jobbers
of this county last week was of
fering to bet that the price of sug
;.r would advance within a day or
two as a result of the fire which
had just destroyed a large quantity
of sugar in the east. He would
have lost, for within about the per
iod of time mentioned a drop came.
And now we have a little more
good news for our readers. Two
weeks ago we made mention of the
fact that we were in communication
with the Federal Trade Commis
sion, of Washington, in relation to
the discrimination against local
people in the matter of the price of
sugar. Below we print a letter
which we have received in relation
to this matter. It speaks for itself,
and it is plain to see that unless the
Sugar crowd sees the handwriting
and voluntarily relieves the situa
tion, by giving the people of the
Western States a fair deal, their
affairs will come under Federal in
spection and adjustments will be
made not at all to their liking.
Here is the letter :
Washington, D. C, August 5, 1910.
Mr. Chus. S. Wilkinson, Publisher,
Iron County Record, Cedar City, Utah,
Dear Sir. Your letter of July 27,
1910, calling attention to inequalities
in the price of sugar as between Chic
ago und points in Utah, has been re
ceived. The clippings mentioned in
your letter were also received, but
tho pamphlet referred to was not.
We nro sending another.
The Commission is now engaged in
I investigating conditions in the news
print paper industry, and other mnt
, ters under tho specific direction of
I J
Congress. Its present work is re
quiring nil of its facilities.
The suggestions you make with re
spect to conditions In the sugar trnde
nro very interesting, nnd tho Com
mission will bo glad to have any defi
nite information you may be nblc to
supply in connection therewith.
While the present work of the com
mission is taxing its facilities at this
time, if the situation you describe con
tinues, it may bo desirable to investi
gate it at the first opportunity.
Very respectfully,
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION,
By L. L. BRACKEN, Secretary.
The people of Utah, or at least
those who view the sugar situation
from the consumers' standpoint,
could aid materially and effectually
by the circulation and signing of
good vigorous petitions to the a
bove commission for a correction
of the discrimination that is being
made against us by "our own peo
ple." It is the heighth of folly for peo
ple to sit down and' submit to this
kind of treatment. Of course, they
will exploit you if you do not ob
ject, but if you rise up and assert
your rights as American citizens,
and insist upon the square deal, you
will surely get it.
THE SEARCHLIGHT.
THE latest journalistic birth re
corded in Utah is that of The
Searchlight, the first number of
which issued from Zion last Friday,
jack Borlase,the erstwhile editor of
the Kane County News, is its cdi
inr. rinil the name of the business
manager is given as C. S. Merrill.
The Searchlight's object and
mission will be to shed the light of
publicity upon such things within
the State of Utah as do not receive
its approval. Such legends -as the
following are given a conspicuous
place in the magazine, which is to
be published weekly at Salt Lake
City:
"If there nrc any in the nudi
ence who enn't stand tho light
vamoose 1 For it's sure goln' to
be shed."
"Consistency may, or may not,
be a jewel it depends on the
nature of the beast; nnd con
science is beginning to look like
a cross between a wish-bone and
a jelly fish."
"Our interest in Big Business
is so great that wo wish, always,
to see it as clonn ns a peeled ba
nann und ns wholesome ns n
bowl of bread and milk."
"Grateful are we "for blessings man
ifold, And happy e'er, to heed the right
eous law:
But, God bo thnnked, we're human
and we hold
Mankind more snered than the gold
en claw.
JUDGE HUGHES is not pleas
ing the majority of the people of
the United States by bis severe ar
raignment of the Democratic ad
ministration. Acrimony, particu
larly on the part of one's opponent,
seldom wins favor. And Justice
Hughes above all other people,
should be temperate and reasona
ble in his criticisms, and above all
else, should be truthful. Thus far
his campaign speeches have savored
too much of Theodore Roosevelt
to win public favor, and we sus
pect that he has been guided more
by the suggestions of that individ
ual than he has by his own good
sense as a jurist, in his utterances.
This, no doubt, with the idea of
pleasing the Progressive element of
the party and solidifying the two
factions; but in so doing he is of
fending many sensative and honest
people both in the Republican and
Democratic parties, and is stirring
up needlessly animosity and oppo
sition to his candidacy. Our ad
vice to him is to desist and take a
different tack with bis campaign
orator. It is possible for him to
voice his disapproval of democratic
theories of government without be
coming personal and offensive.
THERE are now a number of
subscribers on our list whose ac
counts have expired some are a
little in arrears. It would help us
wonderfully if they would mail in
their remittances without waiting
for the formality of a statement or
an invitation to renew. There is,
somehow, always an awful void in
the treasury of a country newspa
per and money on subscription
looks mighty good. We are doing
all we can to help our subscribers,
it is only fair that they should do
a little "to help us in return, and
thus keep the wheels of progress
turning.
