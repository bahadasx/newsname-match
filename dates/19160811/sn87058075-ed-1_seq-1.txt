Henry W. Meyer died at his home
near Ridge way, July 23rd following
a brjef illness from heart trouble with
which he had been stricken the Friday
previous. He was born in Garnavillo,
Clayton County, Iowa, Jan. 26, 1853,
and at the time of his death was aged
within a few days of 63 years and six
months. A singular coincidence in con
nection with his demise is that his death
occurred on the exact date of the thir
tieth anniversary of his marriage.
Years ago Mr. Meyer conducted a
harness shop in Postville, which he dis
posed of and engaged in farming near
Ridgeway, where by thrift and industry
he had prospered and gained a full com
petence of this world's goods. He was
an honorable and upright man in all his
dealings, quiet and unassuming, and by
his sterling manliness and cordial good
nature formed a firm and lasting friend
ship with those in whom he came in
contact.
Of his immediate family he is survived
by his wife, four daughters and three
sons Mrs. Ed Hanneman, Mrs. Otto
Helwig, John H. Meyer and Mrs. Fred
Bigalk, of Cresco, Will, Anna and Louie
at home, who have the sympathy of
many friends in their bereavement.
The funeral was held from the Ger
man Lutheran Church at Cresco of
which he had been a member for many
years. Interment in the Cresco ceme
tery.
The following relatives from Post
ville were present: Mr. and Mrs. A. D.
Meyer and son Alfred Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Sebastian, son George and daugh
ter Caroline Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Thoma
and son Fred and daughter, Mrs. Wm.
Klingbeil Mrs. W. C. Meyer and sons
Arno and Victor David Meyer and son

Also Mr. and Mrs. Herman Meyer and
son Wallace, of Beloit, Wi9., and Mr.

and for the flowers furnished.

BEACH.
Fred Walker Beach was born on a
farm in New Oregon twp. Nov. 27,
1856, and passed from this life Aug. 5,
1915, at his home in Cresco in his six
ieth year. He has been in poor health
for a number of years and for nearly a
year past had been confined to hia bed
most of the time.
His parents, now gone to their re
ward, were among the first settlers of
Howard county, Fred being born a few
months after they settled on the farm,
which was the* family home for forty
years. Raised amid the surroundings
of pioneer life he acquired the traits of
those rugged characters who always
displayed the keenest interest in the
welfare of their neighbors, and his
own affairs were never so pressing that
he would not leave them to help those
in need, thus exemplifying something
of the life of Him who taught that
service to his fellow mian is one of the
highest principles of Christianity, and
in whom Fred professed faith in his
early manhood.
June 90th, 1892, he was united in
marriage with Alice Mitchell, who
with one daughter, Alice, are left to
mourn. He is also survived by three
brothers and two sisters—J. H. Beach
of Valley, Neb., H. E. Beach of Port
land, Ore., E. W. Beach, Mrs. W. R.
Mitchell and Mrs. L. P. Barth of Cres
co.
Funeral services conducted by Rev.
W. S. Kirwin assisted by Rev. J. A.
Pettit were held at the (home Monday
afternoon and burial was at New Ore
gon.
DESPARD.
Joftn G. Despard was horn in Alla
makee county, near Warikon, March

1916. When a child he came to Cresco
with his parents where he has lived
ever since excepting a few years he
lived in Minneapolis. He leaves to
mourn hi9 departure two brothers,
Robert of LeRoy and Richard W. of
Cresco, and two sisters. Mrs. Frank

Gollmar Bros. Big Circus Soon Here.
Wait for the Show You Know.
There is one day in the year when
everyone feels young. That day is no
other than circus day and the annual
affair comes this year on Monday, Aug.
21, and on which occasion Gollmar Bros,
bring their big circus and menagerie
and trained wild animal exhibition to
Cresco. This year as in all others,
they will bring many new and sensa
tional features, and Gollmar Bros. Cii
cus, so different than other shows
bring and exhibit everything that they
purport to have. The Gollmar Bros,
are always welcome to our city. They
are regular visitors and have a big
honest show and are all that they claim
to be. Never in any of their visits to
our city have they brought one object
ional feature. Their methods are clean
and their performances always high
class and refined. The lack of boister
ous rowdyism with the Gollmar Bros.,
Shows is noticeable at all times and
this mammoth tented city comes and
goes in their usual quiet and gentle
manly manner and makes for our city
one of the biggest and most entertain
ing long to be remembered days of the
year and adding to their already large
hosts of friends. They give their usual
long street parade with the beautiful
exhibit of horses, elephants, camels,
floats, bands, chariots, caliopes and
beautifully trapped mounted section,
etc. The largest Hippopotamus in cap
tivity, bands of Trtuaic, two caliopes,
funny clowns and endless numbers of
beautiful gilded open dens of rare and
expensive wild beasts. Remember the
date. Mark your calendar. Bring
your whole family and make this the
one big instructive holiday of the year.
BASE BALL
on Sunday, August 13th, at Flood's
Park—Farmersbjrg vs. Cresco. Far
mersburg has not lost a game this sea
son, and it is up to everybody to help
us out in this attraction, as it costs us
extra money to get this team here.
We are doing our best to furnish good
teams and we need the support of the
people to meet the expenses. Don't
fail to attend this game. Game will be
called between 2:30 and 3:00 o'clock.
Make a special effort to attend, Sun
day, as there will not be a game here

here on that date. Come one and all
who enjoy base ball. The Cresco boys
will do their best to hold Farmersburg
down to a close score.
Farmersburg at Cresco, Sunday,
August 13th.
A Ten Inning Game.
On Sunday last, Cresco defeated
Lawler in an interesting and fast game
which took ten innings to decide. The
Cresco boys played a good game all the
way, and some players are being devel
oped that can give a good account of
themselves in any game. Jack Mul
laney and Alvin Natvig pitched for
Cresco, the former retiring after pitch
ing three runless innings, on account
of an injury to his hand. Jack Mc
Cabe, as usual, did good work behind
the bat Following is the score:

Father Fitzgerald Celebrates Mass.
Rev. Father Edward A. Fitzgerald,
who was ordained at St. Raphael's Ca
thedral, Dubuque, a week ago Tues
day, celebrated his first high Mass Sun
day morning at 10:30 o'clock at Holy
Name church in this city, in the pres
ence of a large congregation which
completely filled the church and every
available space that could be utilized.
The sermon following the Mass was de
livered by Rev. Father Gorman, presi
dant oi Dubuque college, an old iriend
of the Fitzgerald family, who had
known the newly ordained priest since
infancy, and delighted in the consuma
tion of the desire of his one time pupil.
Father Edward Fitzgerald graduated
from the Cresco high school at the age
of fifteen, 'and after spending one year
at his home there, went to Dubuque to
continue his studies at Dubuque college
and from there went to Montreal where
he finished the prescribed course this
spring. At an early age he decided
upon the holy priesthood as his life's
work and bent every energy to the cul
mination of that desire, and no finer
appearing young man ever dedicated
himself to the ministry and a life of
celibacy than Father Fitzgerald.
Fifty-seven guests were entertained
by the family at dinner Sunday at
Hotel Commercial and many friends
called at the home during the day to
offer congratulations and wisk the new
ly ordained Father, "Godspeed." The
Cresco friends sent a purse of over six
ty-five dollars as a mark of their es
teem.
Cresco people who attended the ser
vice were Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Cark,
Mrs. D. A. Lyon, Gerald and Leonard
Lyons, Mr. and Mrs. C. B. Laub, Con
seulo, Cecelia and George Laub, Mr.
and Mrs. O. J. McHugb, Katherine and
Margaret McHugh, also Mr. and Mrs.
J. E. Fitzgerald, Emily, John and Lu
cien Fitzgerald, of Lanesboro, Minn.
Father Fitzgerald enters the priest
hood fully equipped with a common and
high school education followed by seven
years of college training. He goes the
latter part of September to a theolog
ical school at Washington, D. C., to
take a post graduate course and to
specialize in Psychology, after which he
returns to Iowa to take a position as
one of the instructors at Dubuque col
lege.—West Union Union.
Great Swnaer Show Costing.'
She is coming—dear little Miss "Sep
tember Morn" clothed in the form of
a three act musical comedy with songs,
jokes, scenery and girls—lots of them.
Wm. Moore, the original joy bug, is
the bright particular star of this
musical fun carnival, which will be
presented by LeComte and Flesher's
specially selected company of 32 at
"The Cresco," August 22nd.
"September Morn" is the joint work
of Arthur Gillespie and Audbrey Stauf
fer. That they succeeded in their
efforts is attested by the remarkable
Juts scored by this brilliant musical
comedy during its long Chicago run at
the La Salle Opera House. Comedy
predominates "September Morn" but
the delicious foolishness is interspersed
with charming musical numbersjintro
duced by a remarkable chorus of sing
ing and dancing experts who trip
through the Hesitation, Fox Trots and
other modern dances fetchingly. The
scenery and costuming are brilliant. A
great cast—which includes sparkling

Promotion of Fonner Cresco Bojr.
Tuesday, Aug. 1, an important
change was made in the official man
agement of the First National Bank of
Le Roy. W. M. Frank who has been
its cashier since its organization and
the moving spirit in all its affairs, re*
signed his position and was succeeded
by Merrill Bowers, who for the past
twelve years has been assistant cash*
ier. Mr. Frank's retirement has been
known for several months and he has
not been in the bank steadily for some
time. His retirement is caused somen
what by impaired health, but chiefly
through a desire to be free to look af
ter his large farming and other busi
ness interests and to get more recre*
ation for himself. He still retains an
interest in the bank and remains on the
board of directors.
Merrill Bowers, who succeeds Mr,.
Frank la a gfluKtate of ValderBuu&SM^
CoUegp, jQiworaJifc^d learned pracli*
cal banking underKofcert Thompson of
Cresco. He came to thie First Nation*
alas assistant cashier July 15, 1904, a
few months after it was nationalized
and has retained this position since. He
has been an efficient assistant and his
promotion is well merited as well as a
popular one among the patrons of the
hank.
There will be two assistant cashiers
—Harold G. Clappar and Leon K. Lara*
bert, both of whom have had good ex-"
perience in the business.—LeRoy Inde
