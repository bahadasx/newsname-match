Eighteen Voto to Continue Strike
While Tncnt)-one Favor Plan of
Arbitration.
Central City, Ky., Aug. 9. Phono
graphs aro playing and lights aro
burning brightly tonight In the hum
blo homes of Western Kentucky
miners, because the strike which has
emptied larders and closed com
missaries for the past four months
has come to an end. Six thousand
men will return to work.sobered by
suffering, but proud that their union
has been maintained.
In a convention held at Centrat
City today duly accredited dele
gates from thirty-nine local unions
in District 23, United Mine Workers
ot America, voted to end the strike.
The majority was 21 to 18. Tho
majority voted to return to work
on a warrant compromise proposition
submitted by Western Kentucky
coal operators. The proposition
grants the old wage scale and work
ing conditions, with certain excep
tions, which are to be arbitrated
within thirty days. The operators
will appoint two arbitrators and tho
miners two. If these four men can
not agree they will select a fifth
man, whose decision will be final.
Tlte points to be arbitrated are tho
price for a short wall machine and
the pay for dead work about tho
mine. The men agree to work as
buddies in three roomr, selecting
their own partners. Tho operators'
agree not to crowd the mines M
orders to enlarge store business and
rent receipts.
Both operators and miners aro
relieved that the strike Is over, and
some whistles are expected to sound
the glad tidings of work tomorrow
morning. Many fall orders havo been
received and the mines will run full
capacity for somo time. This will
bring prosperity to a district which
has suffered the pangs ot depression
for soveral months.
Fato has turned tho tables on tho
miners of Central City, who havo
been enjoying six-day runs, while
their comrades In adjoining towns
havo done notning. ' The Central
City tipple is in ruins and cannot be-
rebuilt for sixty days. In the mean
time outside mines will be resumed
and enjoy full time.
