offices "handed" to them.
The Pennsylvania Senator ac
cused the Democrats of making
"a gigantic drive" on the Treas
ury to give places to Democrats.
Republican offenses in this re
spect, he said, were trivial com
pared to those of the present Ad
ministration. Senator Penrose, who has en
gaged in several wordy wars- with
Democrats over the "spoils" of
office, delivered a brief speech
late yesterday, assailing the Ad
ministration. PRINTS LIST.
He obtained consent to print In the
Record a list of Democratic campaign
contributors and officeholders.

nomtnatlon donations and contributions
to the post-nomination fund. Here la the
list aa supplied by Senator Penrose:
Amounts contributed to Wilson cam
paign fund as reported by Democratic
national tommlttee: amounts contrib

"separate vote," and not absorption, of
the Progressive party will be tlte line

cratlc committee and associated cam
palngn committee of Progressives will
fight to rc-oleot Woodrow Wilson.
This plan was made plain today in the
announcement rrom national neaaquar
ters giving personnel of tho two com
xnlttees.
Absence of a single Tammany Demo
crat in the membership came as a
shock to Old Guard men. Henry Morgen

committee.
Usually the Democratic committee has
comprised fifteen members. The one
chosen by Chairman Vance McCormlck
has twenty, and there are seven Progres
sives on the associate progressive com
mittee. The Republican national com'
mlttee Includes only five Progressives.
The two committees will confer with
President Wilson In Washington August

Bandy Hook wireless stations were
startled from a doie tarly today by a
Coll for "Telefunken station, New

About 3 a. m., an hour and a half

the message wa signed "DBU," which

tied up at New Orleans. '
"Tho spark came from a German ap

"IfwaB unmistakable, and camo from

This gave rise to tho belief that tho
