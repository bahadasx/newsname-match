SOCIALIST
FOR A CO
t
Here Next Sunday to Nominate!
State Judges and Presi.
dential Electors.
Since the declaration has been made |
by Secretary of State Iteed that the j
Socialist party is a "political party"!
under the construction of the primaryj
election law, anil which decision per
nits of that party to name presidential |
electors and Judges or tnc supreme
cour of appeals, whoso names will j
ippcar on the'general election ballot, ]
the state committee has selected this
city for holding a state convention,
which will he held as a mass meeting
in the court house Sunday after-1
noon at 2 o'clock, to which every So-1
eialist party member, voter and j
sympathiser are Invited to attend.
Some time ago the state, offlcc of the
Socialist party at Huntington sent a,
call to all ehe local organizations,
of that parly lo make nominations for
the places on the state ticket that
might be selected hy the convention
method. Tills permitted every parly
member in the various local organizations
to propose the name of their
choice, and if the local nominated that
person or any other person the names
tppcared on a referendum ballot which
was later submitted to the local organization,
thus again allowing each
party member to vote upon the names
proposed. In this manner of conducting
party affairs the Socialist party
claims to he unique and ultra-democratic.
It is now proponed that the persons
who were eiccted In he the presidential
electors and the judges of the supreme
court of appeals on the Socialist
ticket shall have their names ratified
In a convention properly called and
conducted dccordlng to law.
Many prominent Socialists from all
over the state arc eipectcd to he In,
attendance at the convention, to which
the local committee on arrangements
requests the attendance of all Socialists
in the county and close hy. An
effort is being made to have a noted
woman suffrage speaker to address the
convention and to apeak frony in front
of the court house on the evening of
the convention, Sunday, August 13.
