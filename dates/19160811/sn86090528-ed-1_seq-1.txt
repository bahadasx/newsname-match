INDUSTRY
IN BROOM
CORN BIG:
Estimated that 300 Cars Will Be Shipped
from Lindsay Alone This
Season
BROOM CORN HANDS
NOW IN BIG DEMAND
Are Being Sent Out of Chickasha at Rate
of 100 Per Day; Corn Brings $120
to $150 Per Ton
Brooincoril "Johnnies" or harvest
hands leave Chickasha at the rate of
near a hundred ii day for Lindsay,
Bradley and Alex where the broom
corn is now being pulled as rapidly as
possible.
Six cars of broomcorn were shipped
out of Lindsay yesterday and it has
been estimated that no less than 1100
cars will ho (shipped from that, point
alone this season. There is also heavy
shipping of the broomcorn from Law
ton and Marlow. The destination of
tho cars going out from Lindsay yes
terday show the broad area of demand
for that product ,two cars going to
Amsterdam, N. Y., two to drove City,
Pa., and two to Ontario, Canada. The
shippers are, receiving good prices
from $120 to $150 a ton.
There is a shortage of freight cars
for the broomcorn as 40 ft. high cars
are needed to transport it. in good con
dition, but, they are being assembled
as fast as possible.
A big warehouse is under construc
tion at Marlow, being built especially
for the storage of broomcorn.
After a long session .of broomcorn
cutting in the vicinity' &t Alex, Brad
ley rani Lindsay, about fifty farm
hands came in last night to spend
their money and to rest up for another
siege. The broomcorn crop has been
large this season but. ripening slowly
does not add to the convenience of
cutting. This is done in gangs of fif
teen and twenty men usually, with a
leader to each gang. One man near
Alex has S00 acres in that, commodity.
The demand for hands for this pur
pose was so great, several weeks ago
that $1 per head was paid to local em
ployment agents to get them.

ho believed the time had come when
such action should be taken. He re
ferred to the recent serious accident
which resulted from speeding and as
serted that other similar occurrences
mlsht be expected in tho absence of
proper pollen regulations. He moved
that a motorcycle policeman be em
ployed by the city who should pay par

NEGRO LAD
WHIPPED
IN JAIL
Enraged Mother of Twelve-Year-Old Melon
Thief Gives Her Heir Something
to Remember ,
The piercing screams of a twelve-
year-old negro lad aroused the resi
dents of the city In the vicinity of the
county jail this morning when, cele
brating his release on the charge of
stealing watermelons, the "strap
cure" was given to little D. Stephens.
"I)." had been convicted of stealing
melons on the place of Bob Douglas.
j His brother was given a jail sentence
but on account of his tender age the
: boy was ordered released. His moth
'er came to the jail to superintend his
delivery md to give him safe conduct
home.
"Is yo' got a good sized strap?" she
inquired of Deputy Sheriff Bob Cas
tlcnian as the iron door of the jai!
clanged upon tho freed boy. Bob said
he bad and went upstairs after a razor
strop.
"Take off yo' coat, honey,' 'said the
mother in cooing tones, which, bow
ever, did not deceive the youngster
who bad doubtless heard those tones
before.
"Is yo' fioin' to stay out ob dat mel
on patoh, honey?" she asked.
"Yetti'm," was the reply, but it
availed noL "No yo' e'.a't neither,"
she shouted as the first resounding
thwack told that something was a
tloin'.
The boy, on bended knee, screamed
for me:cy and offered every kind of
a promise that occurred to him be
tween lashes until Castleman could
stand it no longer and forced the en
raged mother to desist.
The boy was still suffering when
they walked out of the front entrance.
"Ain't done snuffin' yet?" idle asked
as she again reached for the strop.
But the boy was done "snuffin" anil
wp.lked mournfully to the sidewalk.
