G. N. WRECK IN YARD
MONDAY-MAN KILLED
Passenger Engine Takes Siding—Tender
and Coaches Remain on Main Line
—Engine Derailed.
A wreck, the cause of which has not
been determined, occurred at the east
end of the yard, within the town limits,
Monday afternoon about 5:15, in which
one man who was riding on the plat
form next to the engine had his neck
broken and died in fifteen minutes
after being taken out of the wreck.
No. 43, west bound, due here at
4:35, runneng 30 minutes late, weni
into the ditch, as railroad men say.
An examination showed that the wheels
of the engine took the siding rail while
the tender and the balance of the train
remained on main line rail, the engine
pulled one way and the balance of the
train pulled in an opposite direction,
resulting in derailing the engine, tender
and first baggage car and the front
wheels of the second baggage car.
The engine plowed into the earth and
was left standing about half upright,
but slightly injured. The tender turn
ed on its side crosswise of the track.
and the first baggage car turned over
on its side. By 8 o'clock the track
had been sufficiently cleared to allow
trains to pass by taking a siding around
the wreck, and No. 43 was sent west
shirtly after. The wreckage was all
cleared up by Tuesday evening and
railroading proceded under normal
conditions.
Three tramps were riding on the
platform next to the engine, two of
these made their escape without injury,
but the third, C. W. Patterson, died in
fifteen minutes from his injuries. Other
than this theie were no casualties and
only the slightest kind of injuries.
An examination of the switch showed
everything in correct position. To
Engineer Ed. Jones the switch standard
showed the right side. Just what
caused the engine to take the wrong
rail may be determined later but up to
this time no explanation has been sug
gested.
The body of Patterson was turned
over to Magistrate Graham who found
on his person $1.78 in coin, a knife,
razor and tooth brush and memorandum
book in which was written: "C. W.
Patterson, 505 Cottage St., Portland,
Maine. In case of accident notify
Mrs. H. A. Ash, same street No. and
city." Memorandums also showed
that Patterson had been in San Fran
cisco, Portland, Oregon, and other
western towns. Patterson appeared to
be about 26 years old and was fairly
well dressed, showing no signs of rough
work or dissipation.. His relatives
were notified.
Wreck Victim Buried at Cashmere
C. W. Patterson, the man who lost
his life in the railroad wreck last Mon
day was buried at Cashmere Wednes
day. Rev. Moore conducted funeral
services in the Methodist church at
3:30, Mrs. H. A. Ash, of Portland,

BY-PRODUCTS PIANT
FOR LOWER GRADES
Plan for Establishment of Plant to Be
Put Before the Fruit Growers of
the Wenatchee Valley
Gordon C. Corbaly, secretary of the
Spokane Chamber of Commerce drove
up from Wenatchee yesterday in com
pany with Barney Segru and took. No. 1
here for Seattle. Mr. Corbaly is the
most persistent and effective booster in
the Falls city. In conference here
with Mr. Adams the two first named
gentlemen discussed a scheme to
establish a fruit by-products plant in
the Wenatchee valley, to take care ol
and turn to profit the lower and less
desirable grades of apples and other
fruits of the Wenatchee valley. There
is a large amount of excellent fruit that
for one reason or another will not grade
first, and therefore can not stand the
high freight charge across the conti
njnt and leave a profit to the grower,
that should, and it is believed can be,
converted into some useful by-product,
by evaporation Qr conversion into vine
gar and jellies.
For some time Mr. Corbaly has had
this question under consideration with
men who have mode a study of the
question and he believes he has arrived
at a solution and was here to give Mr.
Segru, one of the tireless boosters of
the fruit industry in this valley the
benefit of his investigation. Mr. Segru
and Mr. Adams have themselves
had under consideration the establish
ment of a plant in this valley and will
shortly have something definite to lay
before the men who are most deeply
interested in the proposition.

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, August 11, 1916
POINDEXTER'S TARIFF VOTE
IN LINE WITH PLATFORM
The Payne-Aldrich Bill Was Responsible
For Party Split in 1912.
Mr. Stephen B. Packard, 421 Maiden
Aye., Seattle. Dear Mr. Packard: I
have yours of 15th instant, just receiv
ed today, and appreciate very much
indeed your friendly frankness in writ
ing me your views.
I agree with you in everything you
say, including the tariff, except that,
when you say you are "an extreme
tariff kind o( a republican," if you
mean that there ought not to be any
limit to the heighth to which tariffs
should be raised and that there cannot
be too high a rate, I do not agree with
you and I do not think the republican
party takes that attitude. Certainly it
never has in any of its platforms, be
cause in 1908, the year I was elected
to congress, as well as in various other
years, it fixed a more or less specific
measure of rates. In 1908, the meas
ure was "the difference in the cost of
production in this country and in for
eign countries.
In some platforms, it has been stated
in somewhat different form to be the
difference in wages paid in this country
and in foreign countries, The great
republican campaign of 1908 was
fought very largely on the proposal of
the party in its national platform to re
vise ,he tariff and to make it conform
to the rule indicated. The leaders
repudiated the party promises and
pledges when it came to the making of
the Payne-Aldrich bill, and I voted
against the latter bill not because I do
not believe in protection, which I do
believe in firmly, but because the bill
was extortionate and furthermore, was
a repudiation of the republican party
principles and pledges. My vote
against that bill was perhaps the prin
cipal issue in the campaign of 1910,
which you speak of, for my reelection
to congress. I certainly appreciate
the fact that I received your vote at
that time.
In so far as the tariff bill is an issue
in the pending primary campaign at
which I will be a candidate for reelec
tion, very largely the same identical
issues will be involved.
At various times after my election to
the senate upon efforts made there to
pass a new tariff bill to take the place
of the Payne-Aldrich bill, I voted
against the democratic proposals and
for progressive republican substitutes.
When finally, through the recklessness
and repudiation of pledges of the organ
ization then in charge of the republi
can party, they brought about the in
evitable result of putting the democrats
in power, and the democrats proceeded
to frame a tariff bill, I voted not once,
but dozens of times, against its various
features where they failed to conform
to the republican doctrine of a reason
able and well considered measure of
protection. In the Spokane Chronicle
of July 4th, which you will find in your
library, and of which I would send you
a copy if I had it, you will find an
article giving a partial review of my
votes on the various features of this
bill. I vcted against placing cattle on
the free list; against Dlacing horses and
mules on the free list; against placing
sheep on the free list; against placing
wool on the free list; for a duty on lead
ores; for a tarfff on butter; introduced
an amendment raising the tariff on hay,
proposed by the democratic bill, from
two dollars to three dollars; vot:d for a
duty on potatoes; for a duty of forty
cents a thousand on shingles; for
another amendment proposed by Sen
ator Jones placing a duty of twenty-five
cents a thousand on shingles; intro
duced myself an amendment placing
a duty on shingles exported from any
country which places an export duty
upon logs and shingle bolts. This
would have covered Canada and pro
tected us from the only source from
which we have any competition in
shingles. I urged this strongly and
urged it at some length, being sup
ported in it by Senator Lodge. The

He Issued Bad Checks
W. S. Hembling, until six weeks
ago manager of the Weflatchee Inn at
Lake Wenatchee, was arrested Saturday
in Seattle by Sheriff Kenyon on the
charge of issuing a bad check He
was brought to Wenatchee last week,
and is in the county jail awaiting trial.
Hembling, the day before he quit the
Inn he paid the Chelan County Game
Commission for licenses which he had
issued, amounting to 810. The check
was returned by the bank marked "no
funds." He admits the issuance of
the check but asserts that there was
no intention of fraud.
The accused is a former inmate of
the Monroe reformatory and was re
leased three years ago. —Wenatchee

TWO HUNDRED MEN STRIKE
AT W. J. HOY & CO. CAMPS
Last Week the Carpenters Employed on
G. N. Snow Shed Work Up the
Canyon Quit Work.
About two hundred men. carpenters
and muckers, some say more and others
less, went on a strike last Fri
day. First the bridge carpenters struck
for $4 per day. They were getting
$3.50. By Saturday the muckers, bet
ter known to the non-initiated as
shovel men, joined the strike. Shovel
men were paid 25 cents per hour.
They struck for 30. All want time
and a half for time put in over ten
hours, which is called a day on snow
shed work. Friday and Saturday a
hundred or more of the men employed
by Hoy & Co., the contracting firm,
left for the Coast. Since the strike the
work has progressed rather slowly. Only
about one hundred men being left on
the work. Orders for more men have
been sent out to employment agencies
and the contractors hope to have a full
compliment by the last of this week.
Because there was some complaint
from the men about the board, which
costs $6.00 per week, a representative
of this paper went up the line the first
of this week for the double purpose of
noting the progress of the work and
also for the purpose of investigating
the report about the food furnished to
the men. On this score there is no
cause for a kick. The food supplied
to the men is excellent. It is well
cooked and supplied in abundance.
At least our reporter fouDd it so, and
he went to the camps unannounced
and sat right by the side of the men
employed on the work. Also there is
no cause for complaint on account of
variety. There was good bread, butter,
two kinds of meat, four of vegetables,
coffee, cold tea and milk, with one
desert course. On this occasion it was
pumpkin pie.
Tnere are four camps this side of
Chiwaukum, ten miles from Leaven
worth. Some four thousand feet of
sheds are well along toward completion.
The work is well under way and the
contractors hope to have the work com
pleted by the first of November. Just
how much the strike will interfere with
the work cannot be told at this time.
Of course the strikers have passed the
word along the line and may embar
rass the contracting firm in getting
more men to lake the place of the
strikers.
While investigating the strike situa
tion we learned that the railroad com
pany is building a siding about three
thousand feet long about five miles up
the canyon from Leavenworth, where a
telephone station will be installed, to
be called Tumwater.
Interest in Mining Increasing
Several men from Chicago and other
eastern points interested in the discov
eries made in the Red Mountain re
gion arrived here this week and took
to the hills. The Amalgamated Mm- |
ing Co., whatever that may mean.,
loaded up a big auto truck with sup
plies of all kinds here last Saturday and
left for Blewett, that venerable raining
camp that has kept alive the faith of
more than one miner.
LID ON WET GOODS
IS CLAMPED TIGHTER
Ordinance Introduced Making Buyer as
Well as Seller of Liquor Liable
to a Fine
At the regular meeting of the city
council held Tuesday evening four
members answered the roll call and
Mayor Day occupied the chair. City
Attorney Nelson was also on hand.
The legal fraternity was well repre
sented —Col. Fox, of this city, and
W. F. Whitney, of Wenatchse, were
present and took part in the proceed
ings.
The minutes of the previous meet
ing were read and approved and bills
to the amount of 8514.85 were al
lowed. This included the 8250 re
ward paid in the bootlegging cases.
The claim of Joe Teshera was paid
without question, but when that of S.
Kul, the Austrian, was presented there
was a hitch. Col. Fox presented a
counter claim for Nick Mike, the
Greek. After some discussion it was
finally decided to divide the money
equally between the two.
Here Mr. Pratt, who helped make
the Violette raid, rose and on the
ground that he "held the dog back
while Teshera stole the pups." pro
tested that he was entitled to some
of the reward paid to Teshera. His
plea fell on deaf ears apparently as the
matter was dropped without discussion.
Mr. Barnum's bill for 840 for ser
vices rendered on District No. 4, was
ordered paid.
An ordinance fixing the salary of po
lice officers was given its first reading.
A mottion carried instructing the
city attorney to prepare an ordinance
making the illegal buying of liquor an
offense punishable by a fine.
W. F. Whitney, the attorney in the
case of the city against Seaman &
Quigg, was consulted with regard to
certain warrants issued to the State
Bank. He suggested that they be
taken up, as they had no bearing on
the case. Action was then taken to
carry out the suggestion. He stated
that the city's suit will probably come
up for trial in October.
On recommendation of the mayor a
ten day's vacation was given to the
clerk and water commissioner.
The clerk was instructed to ask the
G. N. Ry for permission to tap their
new water mains, in Tumwater canyon,
in cases of emergency. He was also
instructed to get information in regard
to pumps. Council is considering the
advisability of putting in a pumping
plant as an auxiliary to the regular
system. This would minimize consid
erably the danger of water shortage.
The clerk was ordered to buy 5
blankets for the jail, also 6 garbage
cans. Two or three of these will be
placed along the park fence and Mar
shal Teshera says he will see that the
litter which is now scattered on the
street is put into the cans.
Auto Owners Take Notice
Hereafter Ordinance No. 161 as re
gards traffic on the streets of Leaven
worth, will be strictly enforced. Sec
tion 21 provides that no muffler shall
be cut out or disconnected inside the
city limits. If you are not already ac
quainted with the above ordinance a

from either the City Clerk or the Chief
of Police, Joe Teshera,
