Britain Doles $1.50 a Week
To Wives of Her Soldiers
Payments Authorized by Tribunals to Keep Up Homes
of Men at Front Average Only $80.50 a
Year for Each Family.
(By Cable to The Tribune.)
London. Aug. 10. -When every Eng
lishman under the age of forty-one
was deelared a aoldier, a paternal gov?
ernment decreed that grants not ex
ceeding $620 per annum might be paid
to the families of married men. The
grants were to meet nouse rent, ln- ;
surance premiums, hire purchase pay
ment*, cost of children's education, j
and generally to keep homes going
an.l prevent their break-up. Special
tribunals were appointed to inquire
into the circumstances of each case.
Ten dollars a week is not an exces
nve sum to pay for the outgoings of
even a poor home. Still, in many
cases it might barely suffice, and,
added to a separation allowance that
would just keep the family from atar
vation, thousands of married men
joined the colors with the thought
that their wivea and children would
be kept alive with a roof above their
heads. If no money were coming in,
they thought, the ordinary demands
of life would be met.
But now, the tribunals have done
a great part of their work, and inci?
dentally they have given England a
shock. There is no doubt about the
earnestness of these tribunals. Who
ever might waste the nation's money,
they would not. And they have not.
Allow $1.50 a Week.

AT STANISLAU
Russians Four Miles
from City?Gain
North of Dniester.
London, Aug. 10. The Russians!
swept forward to-day to within four I
miles of Stanislau and brought their !
heavy guns up for the bombardment
of the southern Oalician fortress city.
Swinging southwcst from Tysmien
-,ca, Letcaitaky'a troops captured the
town of Chryplin, at the junction of
the Stanislau-Kolomca and Stanislau
Xadvorna railroads, and presied be?
yond that point to the river t'zarna
Uistritza. Another detachment pene
trated due Wflflt along the wagon road
irom Tysmienica and took up posi
tions the same distance from Stan;*
lau.
To-night the Russian guns are pour
ing a deluge of shells into the city,
while engineers are rapidly replacing
the bridges over the stream which
were destroyed by the retreatmg
inemy two dav* ago.
Important I)nie*ter Move.
Meanwhile Letchitsky'* right wing
has carried out an even more impor?
tant operation north of *.he Dniester.
After forcing the Koropiec River yes
terday theaa forcofl movod westward
along the Mon.-.ftcrzyska-Niznioff rail?
way line, reached the Zlota-Lipa
RiTflr, north of its confluence with the
Dniester, and to-day forded it at sev?
eral points.
This move is highly signiticant. The
Dniester, particularly since the rains
of early summer brought it to flood
heights, has constituted the greatest
protection to the right flank of von
Hothmer's army along the west bank
of the Stripa.
Bothmer's New Peril.
The Russians have partly overcome
this difficulty by sxtending their of?
fensive south of Buczacz along the
northern bank of the Dniester. Mon
asterzyska has already been flanked
bv the Russian successe* of yester?
day and to-day, and if Letchitsky is
able to continue his advance north
and nortnwe?t of the line he now
occupies von Hothmer will find the
RaflfliflBfl within striking distance of
hi* southern flank and rear. This will
necessitate the further contraction of
his lines and double the peril to which
he is exposed by the north and south
squeeze of the Russians.
It is believed that Letchitsky will
fnllow up the capture of Stanislau
with quick drive* on Halitz and
StryJ. Both are important points be?
tween the present Russian lines and
Lemberg. From Halitz railroad* con

Aosta's Troops Move
Toward Trieste in
Two Columns.

ON THE CARSO
Invaders Break Strong
Trench Line Near
San Martino.
[Br r*M* ta Tt? TrtTajna.)
London, Aug. 10.?The Italians,
sweeping through the breachea thej
have cut in the Isonzo line, *re clear
ing the way for an advance on
Trieste.
The troopa of *he Duke of Aosta
are moving forward in two columns.
While one is pushing along the rail?
road running east from Gorizia,
striving to control the whole of the
Gorizian plain, the other is driving
tho Austrians from the Carso pla?
teau.
In both movements the Italian?
made progress to-day, bringing their
total of prisoners to more than 22,
000. The cavalry continues the pur?
suit of the Teutons in the plain, and
is bringing in many captives. On
the Carso, the invader broke through
a strong trench line near San Mar?
tino, and occupied the village of
Boschini.
The newii from the Italian front
that reached London to-day intensi
fied the impression that the vietory
was being pressed in the fullest
measure. Italy has struck as stag
goring a blow at Austria as has Rus.
sia. Aisailed by two enemies.
Francis Joseph's armies are hard
prc-ssed.
Austrians Retreat In Disorder.
"Hordes of the devi!," is tbe way
one narrator describes the Italian
infantry. The artil'ery rained <"e
struction on the enem* lines while
the troops advanced to the charge.
The Austrians now are in disorderly
retreat, pursued by the horsemen and
the bersaglieri.
Vienna, admitting to-night the loss
of Gorizia, declares that the Italians
did not himler the withdrawal. All
accounts from the front agree in re
futing this statement, fnr the cav?
alry moved forward so swiftly that
many Au.strians were trapped before
they eould retreat far from the
fortross citv. The Austrians claim,
moreover, to have captured 4,000
prisoners. The Italian accounts con
eede that the capture of the city was
attended with heavy loss.
Austria Open to Invaalon.
The fail of (iorizia open, th, way
for an invaaion of Austria on a wide
front, beside* r.tting railroad com
municationa to Trieste. East of the
city the Italian, are pushing forward,
moving along the railway that runs
east to Bt I'aniel and then eurves
southward to Trieste. The cavalry,
scouring the plain in advance of the
infantry, is moving on rapidly.
Meanwhile BBQtlsBt movement ia un?
der preparation for a direct advance
on Trieste along the Adriatic eoaat
Thii will follow the line of the rail?
way through Monfalcone. The drive
on the Carso plateau, in which prog?
ress waa made to-day, is paving th*
way for thia advance.
For more than six months the Ital?
ians have held strong poaitiona at
Monfalcone, and were awaiting th*
fail of Gorizia before beginning the
advnnce along the coast. I'nleaa their
flank and rear were proteeted, auch a
move would be attended with grave
peril. The fail of Gorizia removid
that menace, and London cxpeet*
within a v*ry ahort tim, th, begin?
ning of the coastal advance along th*
railway running directly to T'teite.
