ITB TOM MEETINGS
TONIGHT U. S. Senator Miles Poindexter will de
liver a message to YOU at Dreamland rink at
8 o'clock. He arrives at the King St. depot at 7:45.
He will not go into any "pussy foot" caucus with the political
bosses. He is going direct to the Dreamland. What he has to say
will be said to YOU—and it will be mighty interesting.
At Spokane he was welcomed on hi# return from Washington as
the senator who "did that almost unheard-of thing, representing
the people/'
And that it why the political ringsters of the state don't like him. They do not
want him re-elected. They cannot control him. He is too big, and broad, and
independent, rising above partisan narrowness to the greater vision of truer
Americanism. That is why the "Hinky Dinks" and "Bath-house Johns of Bel
lingham, who run a so-called Young Men's Republican club, only yesterday re
solved not to let Sen. Poindexter address any meeting of theirs.
A real man —is Sen. Poindextcr—and a free man; a republican big enough
to vote for a Wilton appointee if he be of the calibre of Justice Louis D. Bran
deis; big enough to consider legislation on merit, not on blind partisanship; big
enough to play square and fair with the people.
LET'S TURN OUT AND GIVE THE SENATOR SUCH A RECEPTION
THAT THERE WILL BE NO DOUBT THAT SEATTLE, IN COMMON WITH
THE REST OF THE STATE, APPRECIATES LOYALTY AND HONESTY
AND PATRIOTISM IN PUBLIC SERVICE.
