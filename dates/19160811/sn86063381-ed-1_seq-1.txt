Looal Old Time Baseball Players
"Come Back" and Play Fast
Ball.
NoteThe following artiole
on the Business MenChautau
qua Men baseball game this
morning was written special for
the Pioneer by Ralph Bingham,
noted fun maker, who will ap
pear on the Chautauqua program
tonight.Editor.
Oh joy!!
Oh boy!!
Those business men
They walloped the pill,
They drove old Hedges off the hill,
They went out for blood
And out to kill
And Gee!!
Whoopee!! The way we batted was immense,
We jolted the spheroid over the fence,
We piled the runs up in a heap,
We put the "talkqua" bunch to sleep,
We slugged and slew
And then did sting um
And put a crimp in Ralpie Bingham.
Old Brown and his bat
Were very much there,
And bent the heart of "Stopper" Bear
We ran those bases like we oughter
And put the gypsy sign on Vawter.
Old "Eric" put it out of the lot,
And most of us hit where "they were
not.
Some catcher kid is Roskawick,
There with the mit and also the stick,
And the lad who looks like a kan
garoo
Is some first bag man, Kid Denu.
The Chautauqua folk put up some
/"""'''ball .r'.-""'-:
But some one said, "Go.hire a hall,"
For each one tried to make a speech,
While Umpire Warford wanted to
preaeh.n
For five whole innings the "cutups"
lead,
And then we got old Hedges "dead,"
And gathered fourteen tallies sweet
As they had ten it "fixed their feet."
At twelve bells, noon,
The ambulance
Found nine chautauquas in a trance.
They rode back to the big brown tent
With hearts not "broke" but badly
bent.
Following is each honored name
That had a hand in "that old ball
game.

J. J. Opsahl Makes Offer to Boys and
Girls on Saloon and Dairy
Cow Question.
SIX ESSAYS ON EACH
SUBJECT BEFORE SEPT. 1
Opsahl Answers Beltrami County
Farmers and Merchants Taxpayers
League's Arguments.
J. J. Opsahl today made an offer of
$60 in prizes for the six best essays
written by boys and girls on the
subject, "Beltrami County Saloons vs.
Beltrami County Dairy Cows as Farm
and Home Developers." Each essay
is not to exceed 300 words and it is to
be sent to the Pioneer office befojre
September first.
Letter to Editor.
Mr. Opsahl outlines his concernv
in a letter to the editor of the Pio
neer, which is as follows:
Editor of the Pioneer: Sixty dol
lars will be given to boys and girls
between the age of 14 and 21 years,
for the six best essays on this sub
ject, delivered at the Pioneer office
before the first day of September.
Each essay not to exceed 300 words.
A first prize of $10.00 in cash will
be paid for the best essay to a boy on
the saloon side, and a first prize of
$10.00 in cash will be paid for the
best essay by a girl, and also a boy
on the dairy cow side.
A second prize of $10.00 will be
paid on each three subjects as a cou
pon, good to apply on a down pay
ment for a piece of farm land or city
lot in any of the holdings of the Red
River Lumber company, or the C.
F. Ruggles properties, that are on
the market.
Money for Cows.
The Beltrami County Farmers and
Merchants Taxpayers' League puts
out the claim that if the county op
tion election carries, and the saloons
are prohibited in Beltrami county,
the same will work a great hardship
upon the farmers and merchants and
the taxpayers. If the county option
election fails and the Indian treaty
would eventually be repealed, it is
the hope of the liquor dealers, who
are no doubt behind this so-called
taxpayers' league, that at least 50
saloons can be operated in Beltrami
county. We would like to have Mr.
Ericson, Mr. Johnson or other mem
bers of the executive board of the
league explain to the satisfaction of
the people that money invested in
the merchandise, offered by. these 50
proposed saloons, will be of more
benefit to the farmers and taxpayers
as well as the -merchants, than if
the same amount of money for the
next ten years was invested in dairy
cows.
Contest is Outlined.
In answers in this contest the par
ties will assume that the buildings
and fixtures are already in existence
for to take care of the saloon busi
ness. And on the dairy cow question
that the farms necessary to take care
of the cows are already in existence,
and therefore, not to take into ac
count the expense of buildings and
fixtures for the saloons or of farms
and buildings for the cows. The
question to determine from an econ
omic standpoint is in which of the
two industries will the same amount
of money invested by the public, dur
ing a period of 10 years, return the
most hew wealth, and do the most
good. Or if either one of the two
was absolutely prohibited by law
from being used within the county,
which commodity would work the
most hardship in the farm or city
home, or hotels and lumber camps,
the prohibition of the use of alco
holic beverages or the prohibition of
the use of milk, cream, dairy and

Form of County Option Ballot
How to Vote for a *?Dry" County
Shall the sale of liquer be prohibited?
COUNTY OPTION ELECTION.
Monday, Beltrami county wilH
hold a county option election.
Monday, the voters of Bel
trami county will decide whether
or not this county should have
saloons. i'
You are the sole judge, Mr.
Voter, and we ask that you give
the matter your earnest consid
eration. Ask yourself whether^
the county would be better off
with saloons or without saloons.
The Pioneer stands: with the
people at every stage of the
game. Our honest endeavor is to
stand sponsor for the people and
we hope that OUT efforts now
are meeting with the approval
of the majority of the citizens
of Beltrami county.
The Pioneer is for a "dry"
county. The Pioneer believes
that Beltrami county is better off
without saloons. ''f.
Cold figures and facts show
that in every state, county and
city where prohibition has gone
into effect, financial, economical
and social conditions were great
ly bettered. Saloon men are un
able to successfully dispute this.
The "wets" in Beltrami coun
ty have seen the handwriting on
the wall and they are flooding
the country with literature.
Their greatest strength, perhaps,
lies in the fact that they appre
ciate their own weakness and the
precarious condition they are
now in. They see $tat in or
der to carry out theft' nefarious
trade they must get ojut and
fight and they are employing
every means to win. They will
see that everyone-who wants sa
loons in Beltrami county will get
out and vote to that effect next
Monday.
The weakness of the "dry"
cause is that a great many people
think that the question does not
affect them so vitally after all
they do not drink and. no harm
will befall them even if the
county-should remain "wet." A
great many people think that if
some poor drunken fool doesn't
know enough to stay sober and
save his money, it is his lookout,
not theirs.
But is it?
Every resident of Beltrami
county is as vitally interested in
the saloon question as the sa
loon men.
Every cent the liquor inter
ests lose is directly your gain.
The money that would have been
squandered in a saloon will,
when the saloons are abolished,
be distributed to the products
wliich you have to sell, be it
farm products, merchandise or
labor.
Can't you see, Mr. Voter of
Beltrami county, that by not
voting next Monday you are.
practically voting for saloons?
Get out to the polls next
Monday, leave your work for a
short time and vote one way or
the. other, but vote. Express
your: convictions and don't let
someone else run your govern
ment for you. You can do your
self more good on that day by
voting than you could^earn in a
full week of hard work.
Mr. Voter, the entire ques
tion of a "wet" or "dry" county
is up to you next Monday. Have
in mind the interest of the coun
ty when you go to the polls.
