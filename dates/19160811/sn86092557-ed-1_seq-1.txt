Revealer of Insurance Scan
dal Thinks He Could
Uncover Waste.
(By Associated Tress.)
FARGO, N. D.t Aug. 11.?Charles E.
Hughes speaking here last uight, as
sailed the present administration for
inefficiency, waste and extravaganco,
particularly with reference to the riv
er and lmrbor bill, recently passed by
congress.
'I think I may say without rash
ness," Mr. Hughes told his audience
'thai the government of the United
States is recklessly wasteful, shame
fully incompetent and extravagant, a
reproach to the injustice of the people
because of its inefficiency.
'1 would like to have the authority
to investigate this administration for
aobut six months," t .0 nominee con
tinued.
'The rivers and harbors bill known
to the people as the pork barrel bill,"
Mr.. Hugbess aid, "is largely money
wasted, as there is no expert examin
ation to determine what expenditures
are needed.
?On the contrary it very largely de
pend3 on who are the influential men
representing? particular districts ana
what appropriations are obtained in
this district and that district for that
man and tills man.
"That is a matter of log rolling. It
brings th blush of shctno to the
cheeks of every American. It ougnt
to be stopped. If 1 am elected Presi
dent, to tlio best of my ability, 1 pro
pose to stop it."
Mr. Hughes declared the pork bar
rel bill in 1914 was "talked to death
by Senrtor Burton, a fine Republican," ,
and that the 1915 bill was reduced j
materialy because of he opposition of j
Republicans and some conscientious j
Democrats. |
'This year, just the other day," the
nominee continued, "Congress passed!
a rivers and harbors bill of sonio $42,-!
000,000. 1 ? mt'ess I don't know why |
such a measure should receive ap-!
proval. We have heard a great deal j
lately ol the power of executive lead-1
ership. It has been powerfully exert
ed. Why caunot It bo exerted to
save the public purse from being loot
ed in the interest of t'-ese ridiculous
appropriations?"
Four years pgo our opponents ar
raigned tue Republican party for ex
travagance, and it was reckless ex
penditure. Then lliey proceeded to be J
j more lavish In appropriations than
j the Reiublican party had been. They
j arraigned the Republican party for j
; lack of business like administration;!
! then they proceeded to be absolutely
j profligate in their appropriation's. 1
I "Now, 1 have 110 apologies for Re-1
I publicau extravagance. 1 am just as |
! quickly to condemn that which is j
j wrong in my own party as I am any
1 where else. 1 don't stand for what 1
don't believe to be right simply be
cause it is under the banner of a par
ticular party."
Reverting to the rivers and harbors
appropriations of 1916, Mr. Hughes
said:
"Take for example the Arkansas
River. That is an illustration, as 1
understand it, of a case where there
has beon an expert report against the
appropriation. That oxpert repon.
was as I understand it to the effect
that $35,000 should be the appropria
tion. Two hundred thousand dollars
and over were appropriated right in
the tooth of the report on the exami
nation of the project.
Mr. Hughes repeated his views, as
sailii.g the administration for the ap
pointment of inexperienced men to the
diplomatic servico.
"The paying of political debts with
public office is houey combining our
administrative life." he said. "I am
opposed to it. If I am elected, that
Bort of thing will have no place in my
appointments."

the fall of Gorizia now exceeds 15,000.
Italian cavalry are clearing tlio val

tempting to take the offensive at va
rious points along the Italian front
but thus far have been unablo to pre
vent the Italians from operatoing be
hind Gorizia.
Popular enthusiasm is at a high
pitch throughout Italy. Congratula
tions are pouring in from all parts of
the world to the King and General
Cadora. The King and commander in

Holldus in the Unked Slate.
The third army under the command
of the duke of Aosta which is still

to fight and win "in tho name of your
mothers, your wives, your sisters and
your country."

of the United States. Board of Medi
ation and Conciliation were today no
nearer a solution of the deadlock in
the dispute between the four railroad
brotherhoods and the companies than
yesterday.
The efforts of mediators to avert a
nation wide strike were virtually at
a standstill duo to the fact, It was re
, ported, that the railroads refuse to
grant any concession other than ar
bitration while the men persist in a
firm stand for the granting of their
demands for an eight hour day and a
time and a half for overtimo.
A formal request for a 24 hour de
lay in the negotiations was made by
the federal board to the union men!
When they assembled today to re
ceive mediators and it was said the
board, unless there was ah unexpect-;
ed change in the situation was pre-:
pared to suggest to President Wilson !
that he intervene.
"We do not intend, said W. S.
Stone, chief of the brotherhood of

Scare at Grafton Leads to
Extra Precautions
Here.
Fairmont's Health department 1b do
ing everything possible to prevent the
Occurrence in this city of a typhoid
epidemic such as is now extant in
Grafton where more than a dozen
cases have been reported and both
Cratton's health department and the
Baltimore and Ohio physicians have
called In the aid of the West Virginia
state health department to aid in trac
ing tho source and preventing the
spread of the disease.
Dr. C. 11. Itamage, the local Health
department head, yesterday evening
sent samples of the city water to Mor
gantown for analysis, and a report is
expected not later than tomorrow. The
supply of chlorino at the wator station
is ample and tho apparatus is now
feeding 20 ounces ot the liquid into
the reservior daily. This is almost
three times as much chlorine as is
ordinarily used but will but slightly
affect the taste of the water. No ty
phoid lias as yet been reported here al
though tho investigation yjW in nro*
ress in Grafton hna discovered several
sources of possible infectiou that drain
into the Tygarts Va^y river from
which the local water supply j8 tak
en.
Tho epidemic in Grafton has as
sumed such serious proportions thai
the city authorities of that town have
ordered a chlorine apparatus such as
is now in use here. The results here
from tho use of this means of purify,
ins the water have been successful
that another chlorine unit is contem
plated by the Health department since
the present one has proven to be hard
ly adequate.
Tho Grafton epidemic was first dis
covered several days ago when mem
bers of the railroad baseball team
from naltlmore after ploying at Graf,

typhoid. The investigation In that
town has shown that practically all

flUSH 10 SAFETY
Whole Family That Started
for the Hills Failed
to Arrive.
(By Associated Prei?,>
HUNTINGTON, W. Va., Aug. 11.?
G. W. Harless, an insurance man of
this city, who was at Eckdale, W. Va.,
Wednesday morning when Cabin
Creek was swept by tho disastrous
coludburst. was the first refugoe to
reach Huntington. He gave a graphic
description of the conditions as pro
vailing when the water surged dowii
the mountains and swelled the creek
Into a ragging torrent. Mr. Harless'
story was as follows:
"At 8:30 o'clock, aftor a hard beat
ing rain Cabin Creek started rising at
the rate of eight feet an hour. Tho
waters kept coming up until the creek,
reached from mountain to mountain.
Houses were coming down at the rate
of one a minute.
"We watched houses washed from
their moorings In Eckdalo until the
village was almost swept away. At
all points above Eckdale, the same
conditions must have prevailed, as
nothing made of wood could resist
that torrent.
"When It was seen that lives were
at a premium whero we were, whole
families rushed to the hillsides. Some
never reached there. One could hoar
women praying on all sides.
"The destruction of property will
amount to millions. 1 do not believe
it will ever be known how many lives
really were lost. People are in a de
plorable condition. I believe 250
houses, including business structures
were washed away in addition to five
miles of the Chesapeake & Ohio
branch line which was destroyed. In
many places the railroad bed had been
entirely washed away. There is only
one bridge left, and this a badly dam
aged.
"The sufferers need food. Anything
to eat can be used. Some have no
clothing. If warm weather does not
cease soon the sediment will cause a
fever epidemic. When the waters re
ceded a layer six Inches thick was left.
"Towns that were once flourishing
communities are now nothing but
sand bars."
