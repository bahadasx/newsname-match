Davis Says Our Ben Cap Was in
Prospect is Best Fine Form Sunday
Agriculturist Davis was a
visitor in Cut Bank Saturday
and before returning to Choteau
made a trip through the com
munity to examine the growing
crops. "I recently returned
from a trip to Moccasin, in the
Judith, and visited other points
in that famed grain region, but
must say that the outlook this
year is not the best in that part,
of the state. My son recently
returned from Bozeman and re
ports that the southern part of
the state is not showing up very
well, either. The grain crops
of the northern portion of the
state are far better than in any
other part, as far as I have ob
served and my private opinion
is that the northern section will
prov e to be the best grain zone
in the state. I have seen no
better stand of flax anywhere
than here in the Cut Bank
section and I consider the flax
here practically out of danger."
Mr. Davis stated that it was
his plan to hold a two-day
farmers' short course at Cut
Bank early in the coming win
ter. He also suggested an
agricultural street fair for Cut
Bank this autumn, declaring
that the idea had worked out
very successfully in other
Montana towns last year. The
idea is worth the consideration
of Cut Bank farmers and
business men.
At The Front
A letter from Theo. Ruetten,
from the front, near Doaglas,
Ariz., gives some interesting
items concerning doings in the
zone of hostilities. The other
day the Montana bovs were m
ccuiated for prevention of
typhoid and the after effects
were not pleasant. There is
little to break the monotony
but the occasional shooting of
a rash Mexican who tries to
sneak ammunition over the line.
Villa's bandits are hovering not
far from American army head
quarters and the boys are rather
hoping that he will get gay
some day and start a fight.
The Catholic ladies will give
the first of a series of four
progressive card parties in the
Teton cafe rooms this evening.
The public is invited.

Ben Cap's pitching was the
feature of the one-sided session
between Cut Bank and Brown
ing last Sunday afternoon. Ben
came in from the north country
with the scent of new-mown
hay on his clothes and shut out
the Reservation artists, 8 to 0.
Ben mowed the bewildered
batters down with the same
nonchalance that he would em
ploy in cutting down a field of
Russian thistles and his support
was splendid. The local players
are developing great team work
and the backing given the
battery Sunday was as smooth
ly as a sewing machine. The
result was more than a little
suprise party to the Browning
players and fans. They spent
the remainder of the afternoon
figuring out just how it happen
ed.
After the first contest was
concluded a hyphenated team,
composed of players of Brow
ning and Cut Bank defeated
the Williams team is a listless
and one-way contest. Four of
Williams' best players were not
with the team and its crippled
condition was quite apparent at
all times. The Hyphenates
clubbed the heart out of the
Williams heaver and ran bases
at their sweet will. Williams
has challenged Cut Bank to
meet its "regular" team for a
game at Williams at a date in
the near future. Sunday's
games were witnessed by a
rather small delegation and the
raanagement of the local team
hopes that next Sunday's tour
nament will draw out a larger
attendance.
Win. Humble, of Bynum,
passed through Choteau last
Friday evening on his way
home from Alhambra Hot
Springs, where he has been for
the past month taking treat
ment for rheumatic troubles.
He was accompanied by his
wife. We are sorry to learn
that he was not greatly im
proved by the baths at that
place.—Montanan

-ympathy to Mr. and Mrs. F. F.
VanOrmer on account of their
recent bereavement.

Worst Smashup of Years Occurs This Morning Near
Boru When Big Double-Header Runs Into an Open
Switch. Passengers Escape With Slight Injuries
Passenger train No. 44 was
derailed by running into an
open switch a mile west of
Boru at eight o'clock this
morning. Engineer Al Ba
ker was instantly killed. En
gineer Davis of the second
engine of the double-header
was cut and burned but not
seriously hurt. The firemen
on both engines escaped
with few injuries. Several
passengers were bruised and
shaken up but there were no
serious injuries among them,
When news of the wreck
reached Cut Bank a number
of autos loaded with people
went to the scene in a desire
to render aid. The wreck is
one of the worst that ever
occurred on this section of
the Great Northern.
The big double-header
train was running over two
hours late and was wheeling
down grade at a speed of
:r fifty miles an hour,
trying to make the Ethridge

A "Whopper"
A heavy downpour* Tuesday
evening, continuing until Wed
esday noon, was hailed with
great joy by graingrowers, as
the excessive heat was having
a bad effect on maturing crops.
The recent rain will greatly aid
late grain and aid the earlier
grain in maturing. Crop con
ditions could hardly be better
at this time and it favorable
conditions continue for four
more weeks our harvest will be
"whopper."
600 Voters in the
Cut Bank Unit
The registration lists for the
coming primary have been
completed and Cut Bank is Ahe
third largest precinct in the
county, with an even six hun
dred votes. Conrad has the
largest vote in the county, with
690 votes, and Choteau has 672
votes, so it can be seen that
neither of the larger precincts
leads Cut Bank by many votes,
of the 600 Cut Bank voters re
gistered, 210 are woman voters
and the proportion is about the
same all over the county.
Not nearly all the qualified
voters in the Cut Bank political
division have registered. It
is probable that-there will be
much larger registration for the
general election, as there will
be a great deal more interest in
the outcome of the general
election.
Tomorrow is the final day for
candidates to file for office be
fore the primary election, the
list of county aspirants already
is large but it is quite probable
that a number of others will
file at the eleventh hour.
ed that station. The switch
on this side of Boru was
open and when the track
laborers heard the approach
of 44 they scurried to get
their car off the track and
close it, but tailed to do so.
No sooner had the heavy
train struck the switch than
the track on the washed-out
grade began to slide. The
first engine went over on its
side, the second engine
smashed its way over it and
was battered almost out of
shape. The baggage car
rolled up onto the trucks of
one of the engines and stood
with front end high in the
air. The day coach nosed
into the embankment and
remained upright. The
other coaches remained on
track. The track was torn
and twisted. Rails were
broken cleanly in two, huge
castiogs on the trucks were
twisted like straws.
An engine was dispatched

Speedbugs Pay a
Fine for Their Fun
A cloud of dust, several
pedestrians beating it for the
sidewalks, a dead dog, a col
lision with another car and the
narrow escape of the occupant
thereof. These were the ex
citing settings in the wake of
an amateur Barney Oldfield
and three pals, all lit up with
the nectar of Lower Broadway,
Tuesday afternoon. The driv
er of the racing car was Ray
Rruger, his companions were A,
R. Davenport and Harry
Behringer and the speedway
was Main street. The car
raced past the First National at
a sixty-an-hour gait, gained
time opposite the Teton and at
this point hit a valuable cattle
dog belonging to Jake William
son and laid it low. Jake
narrowly escaped being run
down. Near the Cut Bank
hotel the Rruger car hit the
front end of Austin Miller's
Overland putting several bad
dents in it and nearly tipping it
on its side. The badly battered
racing car stopped in front of
the Cut Bank, the occupants
were taken therefrom and
lodged in the town bastile.
Next morning the speedbugs
were escorted to the chambers
of Judge Thomas, who taxed
them $50 each for their merri
ment. Jake Williamson has
begun suit for the loss of his
dog and Austin Miller has a
repair bill to present to Rruger.
A Double-Header
Manager Carl Hawkins of
the local baseball champs has
scheduled two more games for
next Sunday—at 10:30 forenoon
and 2:30 afternoon, with the
crack Devon team. The Devon
artists played in the Highline
League this season and came
within one of winning the
pennant. The home boys will
be out in good form to meet the
Devonites and the fans are in
high glee in anticipation of a
furious "go." By the way,
local lovers of baseball should
accord the home team proper
support, since it has been
proven that they can go in and
win. The receipts last Sunday
were not nearlys ufiicient to pay
expenses. Here's hoping that
the attendance next Sunday
will be such as to encourage
the boys to keep up the or
ganization.
