IDA'IO NATIONAL PARK, "the 1
Switzerland of America," is short- I.
ly to take its place as one of the
greatest natural show places on I
the western half of the continent. This
wonderland of mountains, lakes, i
streams and forests in the heart of s
Idaho is to be set apart and dedicated
for all time as a pleasure ground for
the people of the whole country. It
is to be added as an additional jewel
to that strand that reaches from Colo-I
rado to the Pacific coast, writes M. F. 1
Cunningham in the Utica Globe.
All America is interested in this for
ithe reason that all the great parks of 1
the West, including the Rocky moun
tain in Colorado, the Yellowstone in
Wyoming and Idaho. the Idaho in the
Sawtooth mountains in Idaho, the Gla
cier in Montana, the Yosemite in Call
fornia, the Grand Canyon in Arizona
and others of lesser note are to be
connected by a system of fine autofmo
bile highways. Good roads and trails
are to be constructed in the parks and
good hotel and camping facilities are
to be provided for all tourists.
There are no large glaciers in the
Sawtooth mountains, but aside from
this there is no scenery in America
more beautiful, wild and varied. It
beggars description. Senator Borah,
after a hurried tour of the park last
summer while home on his vacation,
said:
"Force seems to sit incarnate here
and, one feels, somehow or other, that
he is not far from the breeding ground
of hurricane and storm."
Geographer Marshall's Tribute.
Mr. Marshall, the chief geographer,
was equally impressed after making
his tour of inspection in October. In
the course of his report he said:
"This section of the Sawtooth range
is unusually striking in mountain
sculpture and is a brilliant composite
example of the characteristics of three
of the main mountain ranges in the
United States. The southern portion
strongly resembles the Rocky moun
tains in Colorado; the middle section is
a counterpart of the Sierras in Califor
nia, and the northern end is a rugged
brother of the Cascade range in Wash
ington. The lakes are rare in their
brilliant transparency, reflecting the
mountains and the black pine fringing
their edges, making most inviting
places for campers and tourists to rest
and enjoy nature in all her glory."
The mountains in this section are
bold, Jagged and precipitous. From a
distance the range gives the impres
sion of a great inverted crosscut saw,
hence the name. Mount Hyndman, the
highest peak in Idaho, 12,078 feet, is
found here within easy reach of the
end of the railroad at Ketchum. The
wild and grotesque mountain scenery
on all sides leads all travelers to com
pare the country with the Alps in
Switzerland.
Three rivers of inestimable value for
irrigation in the valleys far below have
their common source in the mountains
of the proposed park. They are the
Salmon, the Boise and the Payette.
These streams, together with a num
ber of smaller ones, swarm with trout
and other game fish. This is equally
true of the lakes, some sixty in num
ber. The redfish, found in but few
places on the continent, is common
here. It has given its name to the
largest of the lakes.
Streams Full of Salmon.
David Starr Jordan. speaking for the
UInited States fish commission in a re
cent report, tells how the Chinook and
C(olorado river salmon ascend the
streams. shooting the rapids and leap
ing the fails, until-they reach their fa
vorite spawning beds in the headwa
ters of the Salmon river in the Saw
tooth mountains of Idaho, more than
1,000 miles from the sea. Professor
Jordan layp special stress on the value
of these ice-cold muountain streams to
the salmon industry of the nation.
Among the wild animals to be found
in this section are the mountain sheep
and goat, elk, moose, antelope, deer
and bear, including the silvertip, the
cinnamon, the brown and the grizzly.
The preservation of the fish, birds and
animals is one of the considerations
leading to the creation of Idaho na
tional park.
Much of the land to be included in
this new national park is now included
in forest reserves. Forest rangers have
already done much in the way of con
structing roads and trails. They have
their stations well scattered through
out the territory with telephones here
and there, so that the tourist, even
when completely swallowed up in this
wilderness, is never far out of reach of
civilization.
All western states are Just now put
ting forth tremendous exertions in the
way of building good roads. The auto
mobile tourist has come to be an im
portant factor in the development of
the country. Idaho is not behind her
sister states of the West in this mat
ter. Good work has already been done
on an automobile road to connect Yel
lowstone park with Idaho national
park, and on another scenic highway
leading from the Idaho national park
into Boise, the capital of the state.
This last link is to be 75 miles in
length, much of the way along the
Boise river. Another road is under
construction from the park down the
Payette river and through the Boise
basin, from which it is claimed $300,
000,000 in placer gold was taken in the
early '60s when the nation was in the
throes of Civil war.
In the construction of these roads in
Idaho the federal government, the
state through its highway commission,
the counties and numerous highway
districts are co-operating. The state is
also working its convicts on state
highways with excellent results.
FINGERNAILS DENOTE HABITS
Owner Either Is a Sloven or Is a
Very Hard Worker.
Although the eyes may be the win
dows of the soul, the fingernails con
stitute the front porch, and when one
enters a neighbor's home he gener
ally pays more attention to the porch
than he does to the windows, during
his brief wait upon the threshold,
says. the Omaha World-Herald.
Dirty fingernails indicate one of
two conditions-that the wearer is a
sloven or a mighty hard-working per
son.
There should be sympathy for the
laborer who has to work around
with a lot of dirt and grease and oth
er disagreeable stuff that gets be
neath his fingernails and pretty near
ly baffles eradication, but the ordi
nary business man or housewife
whose nails are not clean is likely
to suffer a reverse in estimation at
the hands of his or her acquaintances.
As breeding places for germs the
fingernails are delightfully equipped.
Hence it is well that in the public
schools the teachers see to it that
the youngsters are compelled to
keep themselves clean in this respect.,
if their parents have been negligent
therein.

THE AMERICAN ARAM.
The fame of Eugene Aram, such as
it is. promises to be imperishable.
Edward H. Ruloff was a far greater
criminal than Aram., and quite as
great a scholar, and his ignominious
death was a comparatively recent mat
ter, yet he is all but forgotten. With
in the recollection of men now living
his name was a household word
throughout the country. But there
was no tHood to embalm hin in song,
and no Bulwer to make him the cen
tral character of a novel; other mur
derers came forward arnd did their de
voir. and Ruloff's'memory died the
death.
This remarkable man was born in
New Brunswick in 1819 and was a
bookworm from earliest <hildlhood.
Hlis thirst for knowledge amounted to
a passion. He lapped up information
as eagerly as a warm dog laps up wa
ter. He was an omnivorous reader.
Anything in the ghape of a book at
tracted him, and he had the faculty of
absorbing everything that was worth
3 knowing in a volume. and then remem
bering it. His memory was abnor
mal. In his advanced years he could
quote books he read when a child, and
r hadn't seen since.
e The study of languages was his fa
vorite pursuit, and he knew nearly all
the tongues of the earth. His knowl
s edge was profound, and it was all ac
quired without the aid of teachers.
Had he been blessed with a moral
character he surely would have been
d ;numbered among the great men of
e1
"On. of the Robbrs Drew a un and Fired."
this country, but he had nothing of the 1
kind. He was born without a con
science, and crime was to him at once
a vocation and a recr&tlon.
As a boy he worked in a New Bruns
wick drug store and stole things as he
needed them. Later he studied law
and refreshed himself by various
small crimes during his leisure hours.
For one of these he was sent to prison
for two years, and while locked up he
read everything in the prison library.
After his release he went to New York
state, and located in the small town of
Dryden. There he became a teacher
in a school for girls, and married one
of his pupils, a girl of sixteen years.
W. H. Schutt, a relative of the girl,
made a fuss over it, and this annoyed
Ruloff greatly, so, to be revenged, he
poisoned Schutt's wife and child. This
crime was not suspected at the time,
and it was only after several years
that the facts were known. In his
home he was a tyrant and bully, and
made life a burden for his unfortunate
young wife. His conduct at last be
came so outrageous that the neighbors
rose as one man and talked with some
enthusiasm of tar and feathers, so Ru
loff removed to the village of Lansing,
near Ithaca, where he began the prac
tice of medicine.
Meanwhile he began work upon a
book that was to be his masterpiece,
and make his name immortal. It was
a treatise on philology, and scholars
who examined fragments of his manu
scripts long afterward, declared that
the erudition of the author was simply
astonishing. His wife wasn't in sym
pathy with his work. She couldn't
find it possible to love and admire a
man who wrote profound essays dur
ing the daytime and then burglarized
henhouses at night. Perhaps this is
why he murdered her. No better rea
son for it has ever been discovered.
On June 24. 1845, Ruloff went to a
neighbor and borrowed a horse and
wagon. The neighbor helped him to lift
a large box into the wagon, and he
drove away. lie journeyed to Ithaca,
which town he reached at sundown.
and spent several hours in a tavern
holding wassail with sundry loafers.
lie seemed boisterously happy, and the
loafers declared him a prince of en
tertainers. After a while he paid his
score, hitched up his horse again, and
drove to Lake Cayuga. There he se
cured a boat, and rowed away with
the long box aboard.
The next morning he drove cheerily
back to his home, and when the neigh
bors asked where his wife was, he told
them she had gone to Ohio on a visit.
This satisfied the neighbors, but it
didn't satisfy Ruloff's brother-in-law.
who began an investigation, with the
result that Ruloff was arrested,
charged with the murder of his wife.
The body of the victim could not be
found, so he was tried and convicted
on a charge of abduction, and sen
tenced to ten years in the penitentiary.
He was a good prisoner, and all his
spare time was gven to study.
Immediately upon his release he was
rearrested. charged with murder, but
he made such an eloquent speech in
his own defense that he was acquitted.
But the people didn't want this man at
large. They considered him a monster,
and as dangerous as a rattlesnake. So
ie was again arrested, charged with
the murder of his own child. He was
convicted and sentenced to be hanged.
After his conviction be made a suc
cessful effort to gain the admiration
and confidence of the jailer's son, a
youth named Jarvis. He told great
stories of buried treasures to such
good effect that young Jarvis helped
him to escape, and the two reached the
mountains of Pennsylvania, where
they led a vagabond life for a year.
Then. Ruloff, tired of being a fugitive,
away from books and libraries, surren
dered to the'authorities, and, by means
of some legal twists, managed to re
gain his liberty after a while. This
made the people so peevish that a
lynch!ng party called at the jail, but
RIuloff had disappeared.
IHis subsequent career for several
years was a compound of study and vil
lainy. Sometimes be worked at his
great treatise, and at other times he
I indulged in grand and petty larceny.
On a hot August night in 1870 a
burglary was committed in Bingham
ton. Three robbers entered a store,
I and, having removed their shoes so
they could work quietly, they began
- ransacking the place. Two clerks who
were sleeping in the store were awak
1 ened by some slight noise, and they
i put up a brave fight to save their mas
f ter's property. They were getting the
best of it when one of the robbers
drew a gun and fired, and one of the
clerks fell, mortally wounded. The
robbers escaped for the time, but a
day or two later a stranger was found
limping along the road, and was gath
ered In. He Was soon identified as Ru
loff, whose fame was everywhere ins
those days. Ruloff felt reasonably safe,
for his comrades couldn't turn state's
evidence. He had seen to that. A few
days later their bodies were found in
the river. One of them was Jarvis.
Ruloff had a deformed foot, and one
of the shoes found in the store was
made to fit that foot, so his connection
with the crime was established well
enough. He was his own attorney at
his trial, and the speech he made was
a wonderful effort. It was much like
that of Eugene Aram; in fact, he
quoted Aram to some extent, saying
that his days were given to honest toil
and his nights to arduous study. His
argument was along the line that so
ciety couldn't spare him. His great
work on philology was approaching
completion, and if the world was
robbed of that monumental volume, it
would be the greatest catastrophe of
modern times.
The jury decided, however, that so
ciety would be able to struggle along
without it, and found RuloR guilty. He
was sentenced to death, and went to
the scaffold protesting that civilisation
was doing itself an irretpsrable injury.
An eminent scientist examined his
brain, and announced that Ruloi was
by nature a thief and murderer, no
more responsible for his acts than a
tiger, and no more deserving of pity.
Only the high places in his criminal
career have been touehed in this ac
count. A complete story would make
a book as large as his own volume on
