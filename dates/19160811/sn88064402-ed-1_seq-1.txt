ALEXANDER NAMED,
DOWLING NEXT?
Forecast for many weeks, Governor
Pleasant's reappointment of M. L.
Alexander as head of the Conserva.
tion commission nevertheless was a
relief to many who know Alexander
and the worth of his work in the con
servation exploitation of the neutral
i- resources of Lousiana. Alexander
f has powerful friends In both political
camps, but his big strength is with the
land men and the big owners of Lou
r isiana, who have experienced the ben
t- efit of progressive methods as applied
jt to the job. This, probably, is the
it most generally popular appointment
the Governor has yet made.
The most conspicuoua and out
ic standing appointment yet to follow
11 is that of the Presidency of the State
it Board of Health. The State is di
. vided into two camps-those for
Dowling and those for anybody to beat
0 Dowling. The suggestion that Mer
o rick Swords be made first assistant
i. ant House Surgeon at the Charity
11 Hospital at a salary of $3600, would
st seem to clear the atmosphere a bit,
should it be /the intention of the
1 Governor to reappoint Dr. Dowling.
Swords has been a most grimly deter
e mined candidate and his friends are
loyal and energetic. The candidacy,
however, did not seem to make the
a headway expected against Dowling
e sentiment, and by some it is predicted
that the governor will lend a kindly
rear to those who assure him that the I
r reappointment of Dowling, while dis
t tasteful to a distinct number of loy
e al organization men, is, nevertheless,
- the thing to do as a matter of public
policy combined with political expe
diency. In other words, while hold
rling to a good executive, the regular
organization at the same time would
gain a great deal of strength from
the other Democratic faction.
Warehouse Changes Ownership.
- Mr. A. G. Fontenot has purchased
- the warehouse at Rice from Mr. Mur.
phy and is having same repaired and
1 put in condition to receive this year's
t rice crop, which is already being
e harvested.
Mr. Fontenot will handle feeds and
fertilizers and conduct a general ware
house business.
He will move with his family to Rice
as soon as he can have a house ereeted
there.

AUTOMOBILE GIVEN AWAY
IN BIG TRADE CAMPAIG N
he Interest is already aroused in the
)u
!n- great Trade Boosting Campaign which
ied is being inaugurated by the Welsh
;he
nt Printing Company and Greer Bros.,
Jewelers, the object of which is to
Ut- build up and develop the business of
' these institutions, and to broaden their
di- field of patronage.
or It is the biggest thing that has ev
,at er been pulled off in the way of an
advertising campaign here yin Welsh,
qty but the promoters are fully confident
ild that the increased trade during the
it, time to come will justify the heavy
he expenditure for prizes and advertis
ig. ing.
!r
re The prizes in this contest include,
y, first, a 2-passenger automobile of ei
he ther of the following popular makes:
°g Partin-Palmer, Monroe, Grant, Saxon,
ly Dort, Metz, or Ford.
le Second Prize-Ladies' Bracelet
s- Watch, 15 Jewel Elgin and 20-year
y- case.
IS, Third Prize-Three piece French
Ivory Toilet Set.
d- Fourth Prize---Ladies' Fancy Laval
ar liere and Chain.
Id Fifth Prize-Ladies' Fancy Locket
m and Chain.
In addition to these prizes ten 42
piece dinner sets will be given away,
one of the first and one of the fif
:d teenth of each month during the cam
Lr* paign.
Id The contest is open to everyone, old
's or young, and the prizes are well
'1 worth the effort that will be expended
in securing them.
Votes will be given at the rate of
- 100 to the dollar on all regular cash I
purchases, 1000 votes to the dollar on
I the sale of due bills, 2000 votes to the 4
dollar on special sales days, 1000 -
before the beginning of the campaign,
1000 votes on each dollars worth of
job printing, advertising or subscrip
tion to the Journal.
Any friend whom you nominate
will be credited with 5000 votes to
start with; and your little boost in
placing them tn the.contest at an ear
ly date may be the means of securing
for them the free automobile, a gift of
which any young lady or gentleman
would justly feel proud.
The promoters of the campaign
guarantee that it will be absolutely
fair and square in every particular and
that no advantage will be given to any
candidate at any time, and that the'
voting strength of a dollar will re
main the same throughout the entire
campaign. The necessity for fairness
in this respect can be readily under
stood when you consider that these
firms are spending a large sum of
money to broaden their patronage per
manently, and their only hope of suc
cess, and the ultimate return of the in
vestment, lies in their ability to keep
in the good graces of the entire com
munity while reaching out for more
business.
The campaign is not limited to res
idents of Welsh, but is in fact just as
appealing to candidates anywhere in
the parish. A young lady from Ro
anoke, Jennings, Elton, Lake Arthur
or any district in the parish would
have just as good an opportunity as
one living in Welsh.
Miss Collins, an experienced contest
manager from Memphis, Tenn., has
been engaged for the opening of the
campaign, and she Will be pleased to
call on you and explain the workings
of this campaign which is open to all.

NEW YORK NEWSPAPERS
TO HAVE FEWER PAGES
Publishers of newspapers in the
city of New York have taken con
certed action to cut down their losses
caused by the extremely big increase
in the cost of white paper. The prin
cipal step to be taken is an agree
ment to cut down the number of pag
es in both the daily and Sunday issues.
The combined cut will amount to 121
pages, which it is estimated will
amount to 204 tons of white paper a
week.
Most of the newspapers have also
planned a reduction in the amount of
returned papers allowed, which, it is
estimated will cause t reduction in the
use of white paper of at least eighty
tons, thus cutting down the supply of
paper used each week by nearly 300
tons.
The increased cost of white paper,
which, in some instances, has increas
ed more than $7 a ton over what was
regarded as an unusual high price a
few months ago, furnishes a vital
question for newspaper publishers.
The American Newspaper Publishers
Association is urging newspaper pub
lishers to reduce their consumption of
white paper, aul the action of New
York newspapers has been followed
by others throughout the United
States.
