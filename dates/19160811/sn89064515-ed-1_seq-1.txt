WOMAN HIT BY AUTOMOBILE VICTOR THEATRE TO OPEN TRANSACTIONS OF CITY DADS FORCED TO INCREASE PRICE CHILDREN TO HAVE FIELD DAY
APPROPRIATION .MADE FOR PIKE
CREEK ROAD—ALDEBMEN MUST
COME TO MEETINGS
The city council held a regular
monthly meeting at the city hall Mon
day evening, Aldermen Hall, Moeglein,
Blake, Brown, LaFond and Farrow^ be
ing present.
The matter of repairing the Aell
tower at House HoUBe No. 3 jffas
brought up but j^thing&Rg|. done as
Alderman Brown reported um he had
been informed that it had been repair
ed'.
D. K. Harting was granted a permit
to put a new fire-proof roof on the. barn
and carriage house and on the trim
ming house roof.
Mrs. Mathilda Huff was granted a
permit to construct a cemeBt walk in
front of hwr property on Second street
southeast.
Mayor Fortier's request that the po
lice be given a vacation of two weeks
each, was granted.
A report from the board of public
works on the construction of the ee?
ment walk on Fourth street southeast,
was read. All of the walk except
about 500 feet has been completed and
the s^eet commissioner was instructed
to have the remainder of the walk con
structed, the cost to be assessed up
against the property.
The city clerk was instructed to pur
chase five thousand tickets for the
city scales, Weighmaster Batters re
porting that the supply was getting
low.
An appropriation of $250 was made
for the county fair this fall. This is
the same amount as was appropriated
last year and the council felt that it
was well expended.
A communication from Mayor For
tier stating that he had appointed Mes
dames N. N. Bergheim and J. B. Hoist
and G. F. Kirscher to the library board
for the ensuing year, was read, and
the appointments were confirmed.
The report of Municipal Judge Lyon
with receipts for $60 for fines collected,
was accepted and ordered filed.
An ordinance prohibiting obscenity
in public places and in taverns and ho
tels, was unanimously passed^ The
minimum fine was made $25 and the
minimum jail sentence 30 days. The
ordinance was introduced by Alderman
Blake.
Street Commissioner LaFond was in
structed to fix up Third avenue north
east between Fifth and Seventh streets.
N. N. Bergheim, chairman of the
electric light rate committee, asked the
council whether they desired the com
mittee to report what they have 4ne
or if the council wanted the committee
to get some expert to make a scientific
investigation of the rate matter. He
said that at the first meeting of the
committee^gl^out of.-te,nwere preai
ent, at th*e second three out of ten and
at the third five out of ten. The com
mittee has made some investigation of
rates in other cities, he said, and is
almost Teady to Teport, but that only
a comparative rate can be submitted
unless the council wishes to spend
some money to get expert advice in
the matter. The rates which the com
mittee have loSked over and the com
parative rate which they would submit
to the council would not be based on a
scientific investigation and would not
be based on the company's earning's or
investment. In order to make such an
investigation, he said, an appropria
tion from the council is necessary, and
it would be a long time before the com
mittee would be ready to report. Af
ter a short discussion the council, upon
motion of Alderman LaFond, asked the
committee to make a report at the ad:
journed meeting on the 15th of Au
gust.
Upon a motion by Alderman LaFond
the city clerk and city attorney were
instructed to look up all contracts,
franchises, ordinances, etc., with the
Water Power company, and make a re
port on their findings to the council.
This action was the result of the city
clerk's saying that he was unable to
find some of the contracts. It is ab
solutely necessary to have these papers
before anything is done in regard to
any franchise.
Upon being questioned as to when
the water franchise expires Mr. Gordon
said that he believed it had -two years
more to run. The electric franchise,
he said, does not expire for fifteen
years. As to the assignment of the
franchise of the Morrison County -Elec
tric Light, Heat & Power company to
the Water Power company, he said
thai the papers are ready and will be
filed with the city clerk in the near fu
ture.
The sum of $200 was appropriated
to be expended on the road leading
into the city from Pike Creek. An ap
propriation was made for this purpose
by the old council but it was never
used.
Alderman Hall suggested that some
steps be taken to get the aldermen to
attend meetings more regularly. Mr.
Murphy, he said, has not been to a
single meeting of this council, not even
coming when they organized. Johnson
has been to one or two meetings. Con
siderable trouble has been experienced
this year in getting quorum on this
account. The council instructed the
city clerk to -write to Aldermen Mur
phy and Johnson, asking them to at
tend council more regularly or to re
sign so that men could be appointed
who will attend.
Street Commissioner LaFond was au
thorized to install two catch basins,
one1 at the corner of Broadway and
First street, near the First National
bank and the other at the corner of
Broadway and Second street, near the
Little Falls House. He was also au
thorized to get two connections ®or
catch basins.

COUNTY* MINNESOTA
KANSAS UNIVERSITY BULLETIN
DECLARES NEWSPAPER SIT
UATION IS UNPARALLELED
Lawrence, Kan., Aug. 10.—After a
thorough investigation and canvas of
the newspaper situation the department
of journalism of the Kansas university
has issued the following bulletin:
'••The newspapers of the United
States today face a situation unparal
leled in the history of the press of this
country. The public hasjfelt the effect
of Jfae European war in purchasing
cowfcodities and it is about to feel its
eff&t upon the price of newspapers.
It $ now up to the newspapers to tell
their readers and advertisers why an
increase. in price is necessary. In
oth^r words the press faces an educa
tion, campaign for its own salvation.
v^hen the average man purchases
staple article today and finds the
price has increased from 25 to 50 per
cent, he already knows or is told that
the war has brought about such a con
dition. The manufacturer of that ar
ticle has already perhaps advertised
the fact that he is compelled to in
crease, his prices. No industry is more
seriously affected by the war than the
newspapers of this country, and yet
an,.increase in advertising or circula
tioA|rates is immediately frowned upon
because the newspapers have failed to
infohn the public to what a great ex
tent they are affected by the war."
DON'T FORGET THE PRINTER
MAN
The Herald ha& not been in the habit
of 'Sdunning" subscribers through the
columns of the paper, but it is said
that: "circumstances alter cases," and
accordingly we again ask any of our
subscribers who are indebted to us to
kindly hand in the amount of their
subscription. With print paper at $120
per ton, as against $48 a few months
ago, the newspapers are up against a
proposition that demands they receive
whatsis coming to them. Most daily
pape# have raised their price, or are
about to do sor and while we are not
going to do that we must ask that sub
scribers keep their accounts paid up.
$1.50 is not much to you, but with sev
eral hundred owing us little amounts
like that, it means considerable to us.
So kindly take notice and send in your
check.
The annual retreat is being held at
the Franciscan convent here. Bishop
Busch from St. Cloud is in attendance.
The retreat ends tomorrow.
M. Malerich of Eden Valley has pur
chased the P. Belanger home just east
of this city, on the Rerz road. He will
mQve.Jthere the first of next month.
The Elks lodge of St. Cloud has
shown that it is interested in the Jef
ferson highway and last week the club
voted to take out a $1,000 membership
in the association.

INFANTILE PARALYSIS
What Anxious Mothers should Know
.About It
(By Dr. James J. Walsh)
Infantile paralysis spreads through
the mouth and nose secretions. Infec
tion for the disease probably takes
place through the nose and throat and
some of the infectious material stays
in these parts during the course of the
disease.
There is danger of contagion from
affected patients for some eight weeks,
and quarantine must be observed for
that length of time.
Children at play in crowds from
their habits of touching things and per
sons and frequently applying their
hands to their mouth and nose are par
ticularly likely to catch the disease.
It may affect growing youths or even
adults.
Flies undoubtedly transmit the dis
ease and at one time were thought
be the principal carriers and dissemin
ators of the contagion.
The germ of the disease is not
known, but it is so small that it is be
yond the power of the microscope and
passes through the pores of an unglazed
porcelain filter.
Cleanliness is an all-important feat
ure of precaution, but an extreme
minuteness of the micro-organs shows
how careful must be the cleansing to
be effective as a safeguard.
The first symptom of the disease is
usually lassitude and unwillingness of
the ehild to play. A slight fever is
present, the appetite is impaired and'
there may be vomiting. AU these symp
toms, however, occur at the beginning
of nearly every one of the children's
diseases.
The specific symptom of the afflic
tion is some inability to use a. limb or
limbs, not due to any injury.
-The most important immediate treat*
ftient is rest, for this prevents the
spread of the infection through the
spinal cord, in the .delicate tissues of
Which* it can ao so much Harm.
Sometimes the fever makes the child
so restless that careful, judicious medi
cine treatment is required to obtain as
much rest as possible.
The presence of paralysis does nofr
mean that the affected1 limbs are to be
lamed. In most cases complete or
nearly complete recovery takes place,
although prolonged convalescence may
ensue.
