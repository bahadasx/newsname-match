TIME TO BUY CATTLE.
Commissioner Andrew J. FclUer of
the New Hampshire department of
I'Hrieulture is making an clVort to in
terest tho farmers of that state in buy
"i youuj; livestock. Ho believes that
the heavy liny prop of the present sea
son makes this n peculiarly Kood time
to enter the etittle rnisini; business, anil
sugKests that the farnu-rs club together
and semi men into the cnttle eouiitries
nutsiile of eW Kuf-land for the pur
ehase of stock for ilistrilmtion among
Xow Hampsliire farmi. His advice is
equally applicable to Vermont, which
lias .just as yooil n )tay or0j, us ,cr
sister state and whose farms aro just
as well adapted to cattle raisin".
'Tn.ler present eouilitions," says
Cnmniissioiier l-VlUer. "why do not the
fanners in a community co-operate ami
send one of their number who U recojr
iiiyed ns n good cattle buver. hito :i
section where good cnttlo are raised in
large numbers and purchase a suflicient
number to meet their needs.
"A good opportunity is open here
for k party to go into the market and
buy a few carloads of healthy young
stock and ship it i,,, selling it at pub
lic auction. Dealers in horses are do
ing this eoalinmilly. Why not with
fflttfe nnd sheep.' A plnu ofhii. kind
worked out and put into effect' would
solvo a very serious problem that the
fanners will be obliged tO''s0lvo the
coming winter. Thoro can be no need
on the pnrt of the farmer fearing that
the price of cattle will drop, either of
tho beef or dairy breeds, for it is a rec
ognized fact that not only this country
but the world is sufl'efing from a short
age of cattle.
"In European countries there nro too
many consuming meat, and too few pro
ducing it. From these war stricken
countries a heavy demnnd for foreign
cattle will continue for years to come,
while iu our own country everv house
keeper is familiar with the prices
charged for meat and milk.
"Our people are recognizing as never
before, the value of milk and cream as
compared with the value of meat, and
the demand for it, even witli the in
creasing prices, is growing. Ibis is
creating a big demand for good dairy
cows, nnd the farmers can make no
mistake if they stock up with young,
healthy, well bred heifers to meet the
constantly increasing demand for good
cows.
"My advice to the farmers is to keei
from tho butcher's block every good,
well-bred calf he can rnlse, even if tho
price for venls aro tempting him ns
never before."
KITTREDGE HASKINS.
In the death of Col. Klttredgo Has
ins Hrnttleboro has lost one of her fore
most citizens and tho stnto of Vermont
one of her most loyal sons. Col. Has
kins's life was a well-rounded life,
reaching the four score mnrk, and be-
inu active and useful to the end. Tho
record of his activities in public af
fairs for a period of nearly 00 years is
told in another column. Ho served as
a soldier in the Civil war, was a Xld
degree Free Mason, had filled near
ly all of the highest ollices in tho gift
of that fraternity, and had served as
town representative, state senntor,
speaker of the legislature, United Stntcs
district attorney and various other en
pacifies, but it was as representative
in eniurress for pillllt VCarS that 10
reached his highest and most million
tint position.
Col. Hnskins worthily uphold thO
triiditions and standing of Vermont in
the nntinnnl house of representatives.
Ho secured u recognition and standing
and had an inlluenco in Washington
far beyond that of the ordinary con
gressman. IUh work thoro is his best
and most enduring monument, and ho
will go down iu history ns ouo of tho
reallv -notable men of Vermont.
His lifo work, aside from his public
ollices, was in tho practice of n law
yer, and hero he won a commanding po
sition, and tho respect of nil with whom
ho Mas associated.
Col. Hnskins 's interests touched va
ried relations of life. Ho was ouo of
thu must prominent lnymon of tho
Episcopal church, mid as a local histo
rian and a public speaker his services
wcro often summoned. He was n lover
of good literature, and his mind was a
storehouse of historical facts and in
cidents nnd of the finest thoughts of
many grent authors.
PAGE'S BANKING METHODS.
In answer to oft-repeated newspaper
questions State Hank Commissioner
Frank C. Williams has this week issued
n detailed statement concerning the
banking methods of Senator Carroll H.
Page. In brief, the questions put to the
bank commissioner were: (1) Whether
he had ever had occasion to criticise
Senntor Page's efforts to nvoid paying
local tnxes on his bank stock; (2;
whether misleading statements had ap
peared in the advertisements of Senator
Page's bank concerning investments in
Vermont; (3) whether directors of
Senator Page's bank had violated tho
state bonking laws by guaranteeing a
larger amount of out-of-the-state loons
than they hnd a right to.
To nil of these questions Commission
er Williams answers in the aflirmntive.
And then he gives in detail the history
of his effoits to put nn end to the mat
ter. In explanation of the long period
required to accomplish the necessary re
forms in the Page bank Commissioner
Williams makes this significant state
ment: "The only reason it took so long
to accomplish it is the attitude of
Senator Page and his persistent ef
fort to devise some way in which
the bank might purchase' out-of-the-state
loans and still advertise iu
such n way as to lend the people to
think that all the bank's deposits
were invested in Vermont ,or on
Vermont securities."
In fairness to Senator Page it should
be said that his bank is fully solvent,
that the interests of its depositors have
been fully protected and that the ob
.jectional practices have been aban
doned. Hut where does the exposure lenvo
Senntor Pago himself ns a candidate
for re-election to the United States sen
ate? Perhaps it does not constitute u
reason why ho nliiiul be ,rotlrot to
prlvntc UfPJ ' yef o"iV the other hand it
cannot bo said to add in any degreo to
tho p'ublfcV confidence in 1M In'tSgTltyT
ALLIES PUSHING FORWARD.
Italians Capture Gorizla and Take 20,
000 Prisoners Russians Continue
To Gain.
The vigorous offensive of the entcnto
allies on the l'rench, (Jalicinn nnd Ital
ian fronts is still being rewarded with
important successes. In Austria the
Itnlinns have captured the city of
(lorizin, 22 miles northwest of Trieste;
in Galicin the Hussinns in quest of Lem
berg have further carried out their en
deavors toward the capture of Stanis-
inu lrom tho Austro-liermans, while m
France the French and British forces in
tho Somine legion have attacked and
won additional points of vantogo from
the liermans.
The capture of (iorizin bv the ltalinns
seemingly is as important a gain by the
entente allies as has yet been attained
iu their present synchronous offensive,
the city being the door through which
the Italians mnv now pass iu an en
deavor to carry out their lotig-eherished
idea ot capturing Trieste, Austria s big"
seaport at the head ot the Adriatic.
Jn the iall of Cionzia, in which Home
says the Austrians were completely
routed, the Italians inllicted heavy
casualties on its defenders, took over
20,000 prisoners and captured consid
erable quantities of war requisites.

cultural nssocintlon will co-operate and
hold a basket picnic and field day on
tho Valley fair grounds. For scvcrnl
seasons a meeting has been held nt

decided to hold it in the other end of
tho county and invited the county
farmers' association to co-operoto in
arranging and carrying but tho pro
gram. The Valley fair grounds nre woll
adapted for such a meeting. The pine
grove makes an excellent plnce for the
basket tiieiiic mill fur tl ill uitnnbliir If
the dny is hot. If the wenther should
puno rainy, tno grnndstnnd mnv be
used. For those who are interested in
alfalfa, the demonstration plot is nenr,
and during the afternoon, except when
tho speaking is going on, thero will bo
someone in attendance.
At 10 a. m., those who aro interested
in sports will meet at the fair grounds
and take up such sports as tho commit
tee may have arranged. At tho same
tune these who wish to visit some of
the near-by fnrms will meet nt the town
hnll and the party will go to W. S.

Mr. Swccton.
At noon, the bosket picnic nnd social
hour will take place in Hie pine grove
on the fair grounds. This will be a

that everyone will make a special effort
to shake hands with all old acquaint
ances and meet some new ones. Ico
cieam will be for sale by Frotectivo
Grange.
The progrum of the afternoon will
consist of addresses bv W. X. Cady,
