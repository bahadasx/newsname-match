LuBt Tuesday brought forth one of
the closest contest prlmur yelectious
held In thin county for many years
The fact thut almoHt very suction of
the county was repreyeuted by a cun
didute brought forth a good sized
primary vole and mude all the coun
ty lights exciting. The vote was .pret
ty evenly split up and each und every
candidate received a good sized com
pliinentary vote.
To the surprise of niuny, Put San
dies, of Ottawa, carried the county
over former governor Cox by some
thing over a hundred votes, while
John J. Lentz, of ColunibtiH, secured
a hkn majority over Senator I'omer
ene. B. F. Welly cleaned up on N. W.
Cunnlnghum lor congress, securing
a majority of over Out) votes, which
alHo secuerd for him the nomination
in the district.
Fred Uuber, of Franklin township,
secured a majority of almost 300 ov
er his next opponent, Judge Scranton
In the light fcr representative.
Probably the bigg st surprise of
the election was the nomination of
Bert Morrison for surveyor, who de
feated Noah Hinton, out for a second
term, by a clean margin of 192 votes.
A hotly contested prosecutor's
fight was waged between Myers and
Kramer, with the result that C. A.
Stubbs, a young attorney of this city,
secure dthe cream of the vole and
crossed the wire ten votes ahead of
Myers, according to the otlicial tabu
lated figures by the Board last night.
Kd U. lingerer, a third time candi
date, secured the nomination tor
auditor, defeating bin next opponent,
Jim Carlin, by 169 votes.
Leo Si nunc k fell short In his fight
against Sheriff Pumphrey, up for re
nomination, losing out by over 600
votes.
Druggist Perry Baker, of this city,
secured a majority of 200 votes over
Henry Schroer, of Coldwater, while
James Hart, of Gibson, was ushered
in by a 400 majority over Clyde
Tbomas
Another last minute surprise was
sprung by the selection of John Now,
of Hopewell township, for a place on
the Board of Commissioners, Hill and
Steinbrunner, as generally picked, se
curing the largest vote. The third
place, however, was generally con
ceded to go to John Stammen, of
Marion, John Dues or John Hein, of
this city. AH three ran even below
Jacob Tingley, of Union.
The ticket as nominated in its en
tirety is a good one and should have
the united suport of all Democratic
voter, at the November election.
The Board of) Elections had" not
finished tabulatin glhe results up to
a late hour last night, and we are
therefore unable to give the official
count. W(te will, however, publish a
tabulated official count by precincts
next week. The unofficial from all

GENEROUSLY ACKNOWLEDGING THE
CORN
si. Marys Argus.l
We can now turn from things political
and look forward to some of the things
which afford relaxation, as well as di
version. For example, we are almost in
the midst of the county fair season and
of course everybody Is interested in that
annual event. St. Marys happens to be
situated midway between two county
fairs Mercer on the west and Auglaize
on the east und thousands of our people
will avail themselve of the privileges and
pleasures of both. While our sympathies
and preferences are naturally with our
own annual exhibition, we would not de
tract one iota from the Celina attraction
which always draws tremendously from
our city and community. But speaking of
fairs in general, that event surely does
give the people an opportunity to renew
and cement friendships and associations
which no other public gathering affords.
Many citizens of the county depend on
that one annual event to meet and greet
their friends, and while other things may
come and go by virtue of changing pro
cesses in human affails, the county fair
goes on forever, it Is like the circus In
its hold on human sympathies, and It will
be many generations hence before the
county fair shall pass out of existence.
They may make all the fun of the bull
and the punkln that they are a-mlnd to,
but they all want to see the attractions
when the time comes, just the same.
Hurrah for the county fair the Auglaize
County Fair, if you pleasel
DRY FINDLAY BREAKS
KEOOKDS
MOB 10
Somebody .will have to head off
that dry city of Findlay. It goes on
disproving every claim made by the
wets and its people are so busy and
prosperous that they have no thought
for the old booze element which is
now about weeded out.
Not content with smahsing bank
deposit records, Findlay is now to the
front with street paving. Last year
it was thought that this Improvement
had reached the limit, but this year
18 more streets are being paved at a
cost approximating $135,760.
What we ttown in the state the
size of Findlay can equal it? And
with it all Findlay has the lowest tax
ratee of any.city in Ohio, i There is
no balm in Findlay for the bruised
carcass of John Barleycorn.
RAILROAD STRIKE
May Make U. S. Owner of Ureut Nys
(cms onuieHh Tli'.nkM Walkout
Melius Ownership
NF.W YOliK, Aug. 8. Olllclals of the
organization of railway employes known
as the "Ulg Four" announced today that
the men have voted ill favor of a strike
unless the demands for an eight hour day
and llinu and one half for overtime are
granted. Approximately lUO.UOU woikmc.ii
are ulfected by tho vote, Hie counting of
which was completed last night.
The organizations which voted on the
strike question are Brotherhood of Loco
motive Kiigineers, the Brothel hood of
itnilway Trainmen, the Order of Hallway
Conductors, ami the Order of Firemen and
Khgincincn.
WASHINGTON, August 7. That there
will be a strong demand for government
ownership of railroads If the iiircateiied
trike of 40U.0OII railway employes mater
ializes, was the staten -cut made by sev
eral senators representing states of the
middle west.
Hope of settling the threatened lailway
strike through the I 'lilted States Board of
meditation and conciliation before it
realties the walkout stage, increased to
day after consideration of (lie national re
ceivership plan which the labor leaders
have in mind.
The possibility of such a plan being
carried into effect was of greatest inter
est to government ownership advocates
in congress, several of whom again ex
pressed their hop that the present situa
tion will lead to government ownership of
part of the railroad systems in the
country.
I am informed that this plan for
throwing the railroads into, rereivership
as the only way of avoiding a long and
costly tie-up has been considered not only
by the men but by the railroads," said
Senator Kenyon, of Iowa. "The strike
would be a bad tiling lor the roads be-
ause.it would mean a teriltlc legal battle.
and a definite arraying of capital against
labor."
The opiumism over the possibility of
an amicable settlemenr is based on two
conclusions. The railroads, it is believ
ed, do not want a receivership because
it would lend inevitably to a general ex
posure or existing conditions, of inuaieu
stock issues and the like, under which
many of the roads are staggering.
It would also be reasonably certain to
establish somewhere a model of govern
ment ownership, dcvi.it: to supply the best
possible service to the public with the
highest possible wages to the employ
and without regard to paying divi
dends on the Investment or even paving
xpenses.
On the oilier hand the labor leaders
and their advocates In Congress are fear
ful of compulsory arbitration, which
would sweep 1 1 . 1 1 their hands their must
powerful weapon, the strike and the walk
out. To avert legislation compelling ar
bitration the labor men are willing to
make sacrillces.
They already feel they have won a big
victory by throttling in the senate com
mitted yesterday the plan for inqnfry and
irbitration by the intei stale commerce
ommisslon.
Senator Nurris of Nebraska said today
that the threatened paralysis of tratilc
is the strongest argument ever presented
for t he government invnership of rail
ways.
Should the impending disaster fall,' he
announced, he will sieze the opportunity
lo advance the doctrine that private ow-
rslup of a public utility necessarily Is
opposed to the public interest.
He will Introduce a bill calling for the
construction or purchase of a nation-wide
system a line from the Atlantic to the
acill and fiom the Gulf to the Lakes.
This lie will propose to operate as a model
utility, both as to treatment of the pub
lic in rates and employes in pay.
"Watered stock is the greatest evil of
railways," said Senator Nnrris. "Many of
them must earn interest and dividends on
oin two to live limes their actual value.
"Nothing, therefor, is more unlair and
unintelligent to cuss railroad managers.
Simply hired men. they must tiperate w ith
such economy toward their employes and
ith such a make-it-pay regardless atti
tude toward tile public that the surprise
that the lug blow-up liav nol came
sooner.
"The strike Is as inevitable as sum
mer or winter. I'ossibly the situation
may be patched up. But as long as rail
toad managers must devote their genius
and their every atom of labor toward
earning dividends and interest on values
that do not exist, there is hanging over
the traffic of this country over ts bus
iness life. Its food supply, Its milk trains
that carry food for its babies a IJamo
clean sword.
"1 lieleve that these two lines one east
and west, from ocean to ocean, and the
other north and south, from lakes to the
gulf would have so tremendous influence
in moulding rates and treatment of em
ployes that further exlension of govern
ment ownership might not be necessary."
INFANTILE SCOURGE DEATHS IN
CREASING NF.W YORK, Aug. !). Infantile paraly
sis deaths again broke all records during
the 2t hours ending at 10 a.m. today. In
that period 07 died of the disease. The
highest previous toll in ono day was 55.
The number of new cases reported today
was 183.
The total of deaths and cases mils far
reported are 12.11 and G.M'.l respectively.
(JFNTIUTV
In the midst of Uie conflict of opin
ion on policies and whom to vote for
let us take to heart the wholesome
doctrine of the Benztown Bard, who
thus sings In the Baltimore Sun:
We want less hate, we want less
strife,
We need more sweetness of life;
Wr want less care, we want less
pain,
We need the sunshine as well as
rain;
We want less scorn, we want less
greed,
We want more loving In our creed;
We want more joy and more con
tent Less bitterness and argument.
No victory for truth and virtue is
ever won by ill will and hate. If one
wins by mere spite, he wins defeat
only. There Is an old motto, "Keep
sweet and go ahead," and one Is
more apt to go aheirti if he keeps
sweet. As soon as he becomes sour
he strays and stumbles. There Is an
other motto, "Shake hands aud
agree" which contains more wisdom
than we would hastilly admit.

INFORMATION
To Tux 1'uyer Itelittlve lo liicreuw
By Boards of Kevhdon ttntl ( 'nu
iliilntN Sent Out Monday
For the purpose of removing win
understandings and for the informa
tion of taxpayers who foil aggrieved
over Increases of valuations aud who
desire to know how to conserve their
rights, the State Tux Commission Is
sues the following statement:
The Stute Tax Commission has en
deavored to ,see to It thut tux payers
should be advised of Increases of re
turns aud to afford every opportunity
for redress of wrongful Increases. It
has gone further in this tUtectlou
Ibis year than has ever before been
the ease, either under the W'arnea
law in 1915 and 1914 or the preced
ing period. This year notes the In
crease In returns of personal prop-
ty have been given by the local
tax authorities under special orders
from the State Commission, whereas
formerly the practice was not to give
any such nol ice.
On May 2lh, 191C. the State Tax
Commission issued a circular to coun
ly boards of revision, this circular
having been approved by the attor
ney General. In substance the cir
cular was as follows:
At the June session valuations of
real estate should not he increased
or decreased, unless there- has been
an appraisal this year. Boards of re
vision are required, under the law, to
give individual notice in cases of ln-
:tea.se of valuations of personal prop-
rty, the only notice required, un
der the law, being the newspaper
publication of the completion of the
ax list by the county auditor when
the June session of the board Is com
pleted, and the issuance of pamphlets
by the county auditor as to changes
in the valuation of real estate.
On June 1st, 1916, another circu
;ir was sent to the Boards of Revis
ion in which was the following:
l ou are advised that whenever
practicable you should give to per
sons or corporations whose returns
you propose to Increase an opportun
ity to oe beard, although it is not ob
ligatory at this state of the adminis
tration of the law, as a remedy for
excessive or improper valuation by
tne assessors or your board is pro
vided by subsequent proceedings be
fore you as a board of complaints and
by a final appeal to this commis
sion."
On June 12 the Commission issued
still further instructions to the board
or revision, going into details as to
the duties and powers of the board in
regard to valuations. The following
were among the instructions:
"The board at its June session Is
required to exatuine all returns turn
ed over to it by the county auditor
and may increase or decrease the val
uation of any item In any such re
turn, or add thereto any property
which has been omitted and fix the
value thereof. For this purpose the
board may call persons before it and
quire them to testify as to their own
property or that of others."
"At its June session no notice to
property owners is required other
than that which the auditor is re
quired to give by publication under
section 5606. The Commission sug
gests however, that property owners
be advised by mail of any increase in
value so as to avoid dissatisfaction."
In addition to the formal and gen
eral instructions indicated above, the
state commission has invariably ad
vised county boards of revision, when
specific inquiries have been made of
these bodies to use every endeavor
to notify tax payers of proposed in
creases, not withstandig that the only
legal notice required is that given by
the county auditor in the newspaper
advertisement and in the issuance of
pamphlets giving changes in valua
tions of real estate.
The State Commission realizes that
as a rule, It has been quite imprac
ticable for boards of revision at the
June session to cite tax payers before
them; but it should be remembered
that there is no requirement under
the law that this be done. It should
also be remembered that It is the
bounden duty of boards of revision,
at its June session to list all omited
property and to add on listed prop
erty any increases which, In their
judgment are proper, so that the as
sessments or appraisals shall repre
sent the true value in money. The
theory of the law is and it always
has, been so that the owners of per
sonal property should go to the aud
itor's ollice to examine the tax lists
and not depend on individual noti
fication of the increases, the only not
ice required under the law being the
newspaper publication of the comple
tion of the tax lists. So far as the
tax commission is advised, boards or
revision have conformed to the in
structions of the State Tax Commis
sion. Tax payers who desire to file com
plaints as to values set either on per
sonal or real property should apply
to the county auditor for blanks.
Complaints must be filed on or before
September Uth, 1916. Complaints
must be confined to valuations this
year.
Keports from Ft. Recover ylndicate
that their annual harvest festival is a
great success and attended by big crowds.
