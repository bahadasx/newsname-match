Washington, D. C. Activities of
persons suspected of being spies em
ployed by foreign government to ac
quire Information regarding the nature
and extent of the defense of the Pan
ama canal have made th administra
tion decide to request congress to sup
plant th sxlsting law against im

tion.
Representative of th department
of Justice and ta War and Navy de
partment bav been in conference on
the subject nd it is expected that they
will agree on some draatle legislation
to be submitted to congress.
It is possible that tb acop of th
conference may be extended beyond
the original idea of a mere protection
of the secrets of th American eoaat
defense to cover generally such at
tempts aa have been common since tb
beginning of the present war to de-
atroy powder and ammunition plants,
on which the United States govern
ment must rely in time of trouble.
Several of the military power of
the world are believed to have under
taken to obtain information aa to the
character of the defense of th Pana
ma canal. Th latest incident to ex
cite uapicion is the operations of I
little Japan power vessel, ostensi
bly fishing launch, which sought to
obtain permit for pearl fishing in the
waters of Panama bay ana vicinity.
Th eanal authorities have been
warned that this craft appeared to
have been making, surveys and that
these were not confined to the water
but extended to the isthmus proper.
While these operatioua may have
been perfectly innocent in intent and
only such soundings were mad and
bearings taken as might be incident to
the pursuit of pearl fisheries, the canal
tone authorities have regarded the
matter as of sufficient importance to
warrant investigation and report to
Washington. Meanwhile, license have
been withheld until some general line
