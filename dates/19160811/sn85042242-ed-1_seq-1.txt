President Wilson will be called up­

In the negotiations which developed
today can be broken, it was indicated
here tonight by representatives of
both factions.
After it had heard the contention of
the workers and later those of the
railroad managers the United States
board of mediation and conciliation
was undecided tonight as to when it
would again meet with representa­
tives of either side.
Martin A. Knapp, one of the federal
mediators when asked if the situa­
tion had changed since the board be­

deadlock on the face of it. Whether
we can change it lies in the bosom
of the future."

Following ip the report of the con­

York yesterday regarding the wage
dispute. The service of the United
States board of mediation and concil­
iation for the purpose of bringing
about an amicable settlement of the
wage controversy, was invoked by
the national committee of railways to­
day after officers of the four brother­
hoods had refused to join the roads
in making the request. Members of
the board, W. I. Chamber's, Martin A.
Knapp and G. W. Whanger already
are in the city. At the opening of the
conference, Chairman Lee of the con­
ference committee presented a letter
to the brotherhoods proposing that
they Join in application to the board.
When each of the brotherhood officers
had declined, Mr. Lee said the roads
would make application themselves.
The board would not confer with both
sides. Later, the brptherhoods ac­

federal board of mediation and concil­
iation. Members of the board will at
once begin conference with the two
parties, in an effort to bring about a
settlement. This letter of the confer­
ence 1b as follows:
"The national conference commit­
tee of railways again have given most
careful consideration to matters in
controversy between us and to all
that has been said in our various con
ferences which began June 1, we have
also carefully considered the serious
situation presented as the result of the
strike vote of employees and the
grave responsibility and means to
avoid public injury, which must Inevit­
ably result should you decide to exer­
cise the power which a strike vote
has placed in our hands. After Buctt
consideration, it is our judgment that
proposals which the men have sup­
ported by their vote, involve such ex­
traordinary changes in operating
methods and such radical revisions in
established basis of compensation as
to make it apparent that there is lit­
tle probability of our being-able to
harmonize our differences of opinion,
anless this result can be brought

The national conference committee of

Two more men escaped yesterday
from the state penitentiary and one
of the men who escaped Tuesday was
recaptured at Glencoe.
Mike Cherinshow, serving a three
year term for grand larceny, was
caught after an exciting chase by
Jack Girling, the man who recap­
tured three of the men who escaped
on July 22, when eight got out, Girl­
ing found him hiding in a grove. The
prisoner ran, the officer fired in the
air, but Cherinshow still didn't stop.
Girling threatened to shoot to kill
and this was effective.
The two men who escaped yester­
day were members of the crew in
charge of the dairy barn. The guard
permitted them to go to the stock
barn alone. The guard reported at
2:30 p. m. that the men were missing.
It is not known how much advantage
the men had on the officers.

Crowd Legislation Out of
Senate Discussion
Washington, Aug. 10.—Issues of the
national campaign crowded legisla­
tion into the background in the sen­
ate today and virtually the only prog­
ress made with the pending shipping
bill was the reading of the measure.
A flood of partisan oratory -was
started by Senator Townsend (Repub­
lican) who made a speech supporting
the charge of Chas. B. Hughes that
E. Dana Dui'and was retired as direct­
or of the census at the beginning of
the present administration for politi­
cal reasons.
Several Democrats, including Sena­
tors Stone, Hardwick and Hoke, ex­
tended their congratulations to the
Republicans for 'having at last found
an issue" in the Durand incident.
Senator Penrose (Republican) at­
tacked the civil service administra­
tion and the "hypocrisy" of adminis­
tration heads in the Durand incident.
Senators Oliver and Jones (Republi­
cans) and other senators on both
sides continued the political debate
for several hours. Senator Jones said
Democratic senators, in first deter­
mining to postpone action on the child
labor bill, had set the stage for Pres­
ident Wilson to make a sensational
visit to the capital and "in a theatri­
cal appeal to senators have it go out
to the country that his insistence

Reports
London, August 10. Although bad
weather is hampering the British and
French maneuvers in the west both
the Italians and the Russians are keep­
ing up their strong offensive against
the Teutonic Allies respectively in
Austria and Galicia, and at last re­
ports both had made additional im­
portant gains.
On the Izonzo front the Italians
have continued to throw their forces
across the river and have fought their
way to the east of the captured city of
Gorizia. Southwest of Gorizia they
have takeen Austrian entrenchments
near Monte San Michele and Monte
Lonte San Martino and also occupy
the town of Boschini, securing a freer
hand for their operations in the re­
gion of the Bobeerdo Plateau and
southward toward the Montfalcone
sector. Many prisoners were cap­
tured.
The evacuation of Gorizia followeed
the repulse of new Italian- attacks. Qh
the uoberdo Plateau and the straight­
ening of the Austrian lines, made nec­
essary by the operation, was carried
but without molestation from the Ital­
ians. Vienna says 4,100 Italians have
beeen captured recently in this region.
In Galicia, in the sectors of Stani
slau and Halich, the Russians have
driven farther westward in their en­
deavor to capture the central portion
of the railroad running from Kolomea
to Lemberg. Passing across the Mon
asterzyska-Nlznioff railway they have
forded the Zlota Lipa river southeast
of Halich and south of Stanislau have
captured the town of Kryplin on the
Stanislau, iNadorni railroad.
New Positions Occupied.
The Berlin official communication
says that along the front of Arch
Duke Charles Francis forces in Gal­
icia, southwest of Wellnios and south
of the Dniesteer, new positions have
•been occupied by the Teutonic Allies
in acordance with previously ar­
ranged plans. Russians attacks along
the Strumen and Stokhod rivers were
repulsed. Another big battle has
starteed near Brody in northern Gali­
cia.
Owing to the inclement weather in
France military activities has been
confined principally to bombard­
ments, which were somewhat heavy
north of the Somme and in the Thia
mont Work sector near Verdun. A
German attack south of Marcinpuch
was repulsed, according to London.
Fierce fighting is still going on be­
tween the Turks and Russians in the
Mush-Britlis front in Turkish Armenia.
A squadron of 21 Austrian aero­
planes has dropped a large number of
bombs on Venice, causing numereous
fires in the historic city.
KB PARTY
Colorado Springs, Colo., Aug. 10.—
Women party leaders, at the opening
Bession of a three-day national con­
ference here today, considered infor­
mally the election policies of the
party during the forthcoming cam­
paign and outlined a program of ac­
tivity to be pursued in the twelve
equal suffrage states.
Leaders tonight were uncertain as
to the form in which the woman party
announcement of policy would be offi­
cially made. Some favored resolutions
definitely withdrawiftg support from
the Democratic administration with­
out fbrmal endorsement of other pres­
idential candidates or parties.
Other leaders suggested formal en­
dorsement of the party which had en­
dorsed the equal suffrage movement
while another element urged the en­
dorsement of Chas. E. Hughes, the
Republican nominee, as the best
means of obtaining the enactment of
the federal suffrage amendment.
National officers declared that the
party would await action by President
Wilson or congress with "an open
mind" until late tomorrow when for­
mal action would be taken.

The participation of Lynn J. Fra­
zier in the reception of Mr. Hughes is
regarded as specially significant, and
that his participation will have a
tremendous influence upon the rural
vote of the state in the presidential
situation,, is generally understood.
"The candidate certainly made a
splendid impression at Grand Forks,
and everywhere he spoke," said Mr.
Frazier. "He has a manner of ex­
pressing his facts and his convictions
that is entirely convincing—and his
earnestness lends strength to his ap­
peal."
Because of weather conditions,
Mr. Hughes asked that arrangements
for this evening's meeting be made
such that the session would be held
indoors, instead of in the open air, as
originally planned. As a result, the
evening address was delivered at the
auditorium.
Failure of the Progressive party
leaders of North Dakota to endorse
Mr. Hughes here today for the presi­
dency, arose from the desire of the
leaders to reetain their party organ­
ization intact, according to the explan­
ation made by those participating in
the conference. They contend that if
they had indorsed Mr. Hughes, they
would have surrendered their ident­
ity as an individual party—and they
are not yet ready to do that.
Practically every one of the Pro­
gressive party men who attended the
session here, however, dclarcl him­
self in favor of Hughes for the presi­
dency.

today as a result of the Hughes' visit.
One feature was a meeting of the
three leading candidates for the Unit­
ed States senatorial nomination in the
Republican party—Governor Hanna,
R.

Nestos and the successful can­
didate—Porter J. McCumber. If any
of the defeated candidates bears any
resentment toward the successful can­
didate, there was nothing to show
that fact.
Congressman P. D. Norton, of the
Third district William Langar, of
'Mandan W. R. Bond, of Minot John
E. Paulson, of Hillsboro, were among
othT prominent politicians here.

QUEST OR BISMARCK TODAY

Presidential Nominee to

City This Morning
Change in Time of Arrival Upsets Plans of Committee on Arrange­
ments—Siren at Power Plant to Notify Citizens
Charles Evans Hughes will deliver
a "Good Morning Speech" in Bismarck
Instead of arriving shortly after
11:30 as planned, the presidential can­
didate will reach Bismarck on a spe­
cial train from Fargo, arriving in tho
Capital City at 8:20 a. m. for a stay
of ten minutes,
W. J. Prater, chairman of the Re­
publican county committee, received
this information early last evening
from Charles W. Farnham, conductor
of the tour.
Prater on Job.
It knocked all plans skyward, but
Mr. Prater jumped into the breach
and after two hours, hard work, he
and his assistants had so revamped
their plans that Hughes should re­
ceive a rousing reception here this
morning.
Dodgers were printed and distribut­
ed last evening. All the movie theat­
ers kindly co-operated and announced
the change of hours. Long distance
telephone girls notified all surround­
ing towns and at dawn today autqmo
biles will start for Bismarck, Linton,
Wilton, Washburn and many more
notified the committee that parties
would motor to Bismarck in time for
the meeting.
Special Necessary.
At the last minute it was impos­
sible to utilize the second section of
No. 3 as a special for Hughes. This
necessitated running a special from
Fargo to Helena. Montana is anxious
to secure more of Hughes' time and
in order to equalize matters, it was
decided at the eleventh hour to cut
the trip from Fargo through North Da­
kota a little short.
This means the elimination of the
stops at Valley City and Jamestown,
making Bismarck the first appearance
of Hughes on the Slope.
Left At 1:00 A. M.
The Hughes special left Fargo at
1 o'clock this morning and will arrive
at Bismarck at 8:20. It leaves the
.Capital City at 8:30 arriving at Man
dan at 8:45. The special pulls out at
7:55 Mandan time, arriving in Dickin­
son at 11 a. m. for a ten minute stop.
Short stops will be made also at
Medora and Beach. In Montana stops
will be made at Miles City and For
sythe. An evening meeting will be
held at Billings.
No Formalities.
Bismarck will give Hughes as good
a reception as possible under the
changed conditions. The reception
committee headed by Mr. Prater will
be on hand. All formalities will have
to be dispensed with so that Hughes
can be given as much time as pos­
sible.
One long blast of the whistle from
the Hughes Electric Light plant at 8
a. m. will signa\ the people of Bis­
marck. This will give them plenty
of time to arrive at the Northern Pa­
cific depot where Mr. Hughes will
deliver his address from the end of
the observation car.
The citizens of Bismarck are urged
to turn out and give the presidential
nominee a rousing reception. It prob­
ably will be the only opportunity giv­
en this city during the presidential
campaign to hear Mr. Hughes.
Dickinson Represented.
J. G. Quinlivan, H. J. Blanchard and
J. F. Moes of Dickinson arrived in
Bismarck last evening to meet the
special. They will return on the
Hughes train to Dickinson today.
In the party will be Mr. and Mrs.
Hughes, Senator McCumber, Gunder
Olson. Burt M. Devenport of New
York, former senator, besides thirty
or forty press representatives and
number of stenographers. Mr. Hughes
furnishes no advance copies of his
addresses. He speaks extemporane­
ously and copies of his speech for dis­
