CHAUTAUQUA WELL. ATTENDED
The Chautauqua came to a close
Tuesday night with a program from
the Hawaiian, under the manage
ment of the famous "BUI" Ellis
From the first number to the last the
big tent was crowded at each num
ber, and we believe the management
of the Redpath-Horner company is
willing to swear that Liberal is the
best Chautauqua town of its size on
earth. The first number was Inter
rupted when about half through by
the blowing of the fire whistle, which
claimed the attention of nearly the
entire audience, but the others went
through without a hitch and were
seemingly enjoyed by everyone who
heard them. The train' Monday af
ternoon was several hours late, ne
cessitating the "doubling up" of the
afternoon and evening programs. We
were unable to attend that number
biit understand from those who did
that It was the best three and a half
hours' entertainment ever given in
the town. That was the evening of
the lecture of Dr. Gordon on"Slx-Cyl
inder Living," and we have heard it
spoken of as the leading number of
the entire Chautauqua. In another
column you will find a special write-
up of Dr. Gordon and his lecture.
That the Chautauqua as a whole
seemed to give satisfaction Is wit
nessed by the tact that a meeting
was held after the last number was
completed, supplemented by another
meeting by the Chautauqua commit
tee of the Chamber of Commerce a
day or two later, at which It was de
cided to buy a seven-day course for
next year. This was done in order
to get the superior talent that goes
with the seven-day contract, and you
can bank on something out of the
ordinary for next year. The price
paid for this season's course was fir
000 flat, and the larger contract calls
for $2,000, but will be well worth
the difference in the talent that goes
with it. Over $800 worth of tickets
were sold by the business men this
year which, together with the gate
receipts, brought, the total to about
$1,600, leaving a balance of ..about
w apply" on next year's' contract,
and raising the balance by selling
tickets and cash gate -receipts is fig
ured as being an easy Job.
A SMALL BLAZE ,
The fire alarm sounded Friday af
ternoon and a hurry-up run was
made by the fire apparatus to the
home of Mr. and Mrs. H. W. Lane, in
the east part of town, where one of
the. outbuildings was found to be on
fire. The fire was caused by children
playing with matches. The fire was
confined to the one building and was
soon put out, but had it not been for
the prompt response of the fire wa
gon and crew it could have spread
rapidly to adjoining buildings.

Q.J. WILKINS, Jeweler (At Taylor's)
' A SPLENDID LECTURE .
p (By Ray Jl (l lman). w.' ' .
. -The best lecture given at the Chau
tauqua just closed at Liberal was
that given by Dr. P. E. Gordon, who
in his "Six-Cylinder Living" gave a
wholesome, instructive message to
the young and a thought of encour
agement and sympathy to the older
ones. He presented his subject in a
manner that was delightfully differ
ent in that he employed no slang, old
truths spoken appeared new, refresh
ing. He avoided piffle, which is too
often perpetrated on a suffering pub
lic, and another feature which does
not occur with other speakers there
was a human Interest that attended
the entire lecture. That Is the rea
son that the young people as well as
the older ones gave him their undi
vided attention. Dr. Gordon has been
with the Chautauqua a few years, on
ly, having been occupying a pulpit
in the Methodist church at Fort
Worth, Texas, and several points in
this state and Oklahoma. The man
agers of the Chautauqua have dis
covered his ability and after this year
he will be given a better salary for
the time that he may care to devote
to work on the platform. From the
many comments of the Liberal peo
ple, the Chautauqua managers are
not the only ones who have made a
discovery.
' Mllo C. Phelps of Pratt, Kansas,
who is one of the efficient congenial
mall clerks on Rock Island trains 8
and 4, dropped off on Thursday, and
while here purchased a quarter of
land from Griffith Baughman. Mr.
Phelps bought one of the quarters
owned and for sale by the Santa Fe
Land and Improvement Co. on very
easy terms. This is a proposition
which other salaried men should be
Interested In, as Seward county land
Is always a good Investment, and get
ting better.
Quite a few people of the neigh
boring towns have been in Liberal
during the past week to attend the
Chautauqua, Forgan, Hooker and
Hugoton furnishing the biggest
crowds. Liberal should remember
these towns whenever any event hap
pens In any of them and reciprocate
by showing up at the same in good
numbers. '
R. W. Long, a representative of a
Kansas City wholesale paper house,
was In town yesterday and made this
office a call. It's stilt the same old
story with the' paper salesman go
ing np! Our bunch of print paper
we now have on hand looks more like
a stack of currency every day.
MRS. HEN LINE INJURED ,
f in -feaB-Mnafnasa . to meet" Irer
daughter, who was on the train, Mrs!
W. R. Henline attempted to cross
the track and reach the depot plat
form at Arkalon Just ahead of the
engine .on train No. 1, but she was
too late. The engine struck her.. The
Impact knocked her down, breaking
her left leg below the knee and she
suffers some bruises on the face and
head. The engine was stopped ' Im
mediately. The train crew tenderly
lifted the lady to the train and
brought her to Liberal and she Is now
under the care of the Rock 'Island
surgeon. She is getting along as wen
as could be expected.
Miss Lottie Henline had been away
at school for several months and was
on the train that struck her mother.
The -accident is much lamented by the
train crew and particularly the con
ductor who has known Mrs. Henline
for many years. He affectionately
refers to her as mother. Tears ago,
he and other railroad men, when Ar
kalon was the terminus of the Rock
Island, boarded at the home of Mi1.
and Mrs. Henline. 1
BAND NOTES
Well, the chautauqua has come and
gone. They had some very good tal
ent and some of it seemed to be en
joyed immensely, but to our notion
of thinking a Chautauqua Is not com
plete without a band. The Redpath
& Horner people have Thavlus' band
under contract for this season. This
is one of the best bands in the coun
try but Liberal didn't get It, nor did
we have a band last year. Well, here's
hoping for next year anyhow.
Bob Record has returned from a
two weeks' vacation spent In Okla.
Any of you parents who want your
youngsters to start In the new class
of band men had better get busy.
Anyone wanting any information In
regards to this call up Mr. Reasoner
at the Keystone hotel.
Harold Sutton is going to take les
sons on the cornet.
The band will give weekly concerts
Wednesday nights on all the promi
nent corners. The band has bought
a lot of new music to be used in the
near future.
Ed Fowler was up from Hooker to
heir the Hawallans.

meeting Mr. and Mrs.. Ellis of the

them last year. They miss him very
much. D. M.

. . . STOLE A FORD -
Tuesday lght While- Chirtey SnilUi
was attending the chautauqua some
color blind individual who couldn't
distinguish between his and other
people's property, stole Smith's 4rd
and after using the machine as long
as deBlred left it north' of Mrs. Walk
er's home', a few blocks from where
they took it. When the Ford was
taken the top was up and curtains
On, but when found the top bad been
lowered probably to prevent detection-.
The car had evidently been run
some distance for It was covered with
mud and water. "This is an exceed
ing reckless and dangerous pastime
and when a few fellows have paid the
penalty for such work It may serve
to break up the habit. Other Liberal
men have had their machines ap
propriated for a short time and the
habit may prove to get too deep root
ed for the joy riders to handle. A
good, healthy fine mighty help mat,
ters wonderfully.
