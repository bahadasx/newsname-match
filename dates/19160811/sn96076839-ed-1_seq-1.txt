Arral demerits Being Completed
For
(he Sixth Annual
Banquet
The Sixth Annual Banquet of the
Charlevoix Countv Republican Club
will be held at the Armory in East Jor
dan on next Tuesday evening, Aug.
15th.
Secretary of the Club, Att'y D. H.
Fitch, as well as the other officers and
committees are hard to work on the
various details. Several important
features particularly that of speakers
have not yet been fully decided up
on at this writing but it is safe to say
that the committee selected to secure
speakers is leaving no stone unturned
to obtain the best possible talent for
the occasion.
" This is a "presidential" year, and
with the state primary only a few days
away, interest in things political is
keen among the electors. That the
s-th annual banquet will be the best
one ever held is a foregone conclusion.
The Banquet will commence at 8:00
p. m. at the Armory. Metropole Or
chestra, whose delightful music is a
celebrated feature throughout this
region have been engaged for this part
of the program. The menu will be
catered by Giles & Hawkins, which is a
sufficient guarantee of plenty to eat
and worth eating.
Officers of the Club, and the various
committees appointed, are as follows:
President, A. O. Urquhart of Boyne
City; Secretary, D. H. Fitch of East
Jordan; Treasurer, R. L. Lewis of
Charlevuix.

YOU'RE WELCOME!
THE STATE FORESTERS.
The Grand Rapids Herald pays the
following well-deserved compliment to
Chief Forester W. J. Pearson, of Boyne
Falls. Two years ago, under the direc
tion of Forester Pearson, the Epsilon
settlement in Springvale township, was
saved from a threatening fire:
"Within the last few days Michigan
has come to realize the value of the
forestry division of the state public
domain commission. '
"For a week or more Chief Forester
W. J. Pearson and his assistant have
been fighting forest fires in Northern
Michigan. The most serious conditions
which Northern Michigan has been
forced to combat in many years have
aided the flames. Underbrush and
even the larger trees have been dried
almost to the tinder stage by weeks of
hot weather. The rain which was
needed Jj safeguard the forests has
failed to come, and thousands of acres
of valuable timber have proved ap
petizing food for the fires. Sparks
from locomotives and carlessness of
persons in the forests have started the
flames which, once ablaze, have been
.driven before the wind at fearful speed,
fnder ordinary conditions a forest fire
Is difficult to fight, but this dry season
the task has been even more trying and
dangerous than usual.
"It is this condition that has given
the Michigan forestry division an op
portunity to demonstrate its worth.
The forestry division is a valuable de
partment of the state government even
without the flames to fight. It does
much to prevent fires in the forest and
is constantly engaged in searching for
dangerous tree diseases, but these
activities are less spectacular than the
present work.
"Without the state forestry wardens
the fight against the flames would have
been a disorganized, haphazard effort.
Under directions of Chief Forester
Pearson it has been systematized, and
hundreds of special deputies have been
called to his aid.
"Although the fires are the most
serious in many years, no lives nave
been lost due largely to the alert activi
ty of the forest wardens, and without
them there can be no question but that
the property damage would have been
even larger than the present figures."
MILLIONS
FOR
GOOD ROADS
"By the passage of the Federal Aid
Road Bill this month, the Government
of the United States has put itself in
the way to reap great benefits. Ac
cording to the new law, the sum of
$S5,000,000.00 of federal funds is made
available for the construction of coun
try roads. Of this amount, $75,000,000
is to be expended for the construction
of rural post roads under co-operative
arrangements with the highway de
partments of the various states and
110,000,000 is to be used in developing
roads and trails within or partly within
the national forests.
This law is proof of the national
awakening to the fact that our country
is lamentably deficient in well con
structed highways. The main lines of
travel in the early days were the shores
of great waters and the rivers and
canals. The railroad building era fol
lowed close upon the period of the
river steamboat and for these and
other reasons the highways of the land
were neglected.
One of the most powerful of the
agencies now at work for better roads
is the automobile. The country owes
a debt to the motor driven car for mak
ing insistent demand for adequate high
ways over which to travel.
The expenditure of these many mil
lions of dollars will benefit the people
very greatly by helping to convey
farm products to market and thus to
some extent it will make living cheaper
and more comfortable. Moreover, the
country with an abundance of good
roads within its boundaries is more
easily defended when threatened from
without. The best result of all, how
ever, will be the quickening of inter
course and intelligence and the unify
ing of this great nation, which as yet is
too much given to sprawling physically
and otherwise." Exchange.
The representative of the Govern
ment, Mr. Fauntelrpy, on the trip of
the West Michigan Pike and the Dixie
Highway Association, to Mackinaw City
on the 13th ult. stated that our share
(the State of Michigan's share) would
be $2,559,750.00. This, of itself, is suf
ficient to spur Charlevoix County to be
up and doing. We need the roads in
order to induce the tourists to come
here. We have the climate, the beauti
ful spots and the fruit with a flavor,
good flavor the best flavor in fact.

OF
THE
SEPT.
COUNTY FAIR,
5-6-7-8, 1916
With Abundance of Crops, Ex
hibits will Overflow.
The Thirty-second annual Fair of the
Charlevoix County Agricultural Society
will be held on the Society's Fair
Grounds at East Jordan, Michigan, on
September 5, 6, 7 and 8.
As in the past, the officers are mak
ing an especial effort to make this Fair
a better and more successful one than
any previous Fair. This year Charle
voix County is blessed with an abun
dance of crops of all kinds. The Agri
cultural Society offers premiums for
the various exhibits which compare
more than favorably with the Premium
Lists of the surrounding Counties and
the Association expects that the De
partments will be filled to the limit
with exhibits.
Each year the Society has been im
proving its grounds as its means would
permit and now has grounds which are
unexcelled by the Fair Associations of
any County in the State. This year a
road is being built which will separate
automobiles and horse driven vehicles
from the pedestrians. The race track
is being kept in condition and excellent
races assured.
The Association offers as free t-
tractions, the following:
1. Two aeroplane flights daily by O.
E. Williams of the Williams Aeroplane
Company. Flights are assured as this
Company signed a "No flight no pay"
contract.
2. Copeland & Wenzell, premier
horizontal Bar Comedians.
3. Paul Wenzell in an impersonation
of the African monkey. A very clever
aerial act.
4. Bessie Mack, Aerial flying trapeze.
5. Bessie Mack, Aerial swinging
ladder.
G. Sandy Copeland, Flying muscular
ring Act.
7. Races.
8. Band music.
A series of ball games for the cham
pionship of the County is being arrang
ed between the East Jordan, Boyne
City and Charlevoix business and pro
fessional men.
Company I, 33rd. Inf. M. N. G. will
put on an exhibition ending with sham
battle with aeroplane "one day of the
Fair, if they are released from United
States service by that time.
The officers of the Society realize
that they have undoubtedly made some
mistakes in the past and, being human
beings, presume that it is likely they
will make mistakes in the future. In
asmuch, however, as the Agricultural
Society is an institution of the people
of Charlevoix County, they expect the
people to stand back of it, to push the
Fair, not knock it, and do everything in
their power to make it a brilliant suc
cess, and suggest that if anyone has a
legitimate grievance or does not like
the manner in which the Fair has been
run in the past, that instead of sulking
and refusing to help, this person buy a
membership ticket and see to it that
officers are selected for the Society
who will be capable, in his judgment,
of properly conducting the affairs of
the Society.
Bring in your exhibits, Talk the Fair
Be there yourself and see to it that
your friends come, Make this Fair one
to be remembered as a brilliantly suc
cessful one.

THE NATION IS SHOCKING
LY UNPREPARED.
It la apparent that we are
shockingly unprepared. There
Is no room for controversy on
this point since the object les
son on the Mexican border. All
our available regular troops
(less, I believe, than 40,000) are
there or In Mexico, and as these
have been deemed Insufficient
the entire National Guard has
been ordered out; that la, we
are summoning practically all
our movable military forces In
order to present bandit incur
sions. In view of the warnings
of the past three years, it 'is
Inexcusable that we should find
ourselves In this plight. For
our faithful guardsmen, who
with a fine patriotism responded
to this call and are bearing this
burden, I have nothing but
praise. But I think It little
short of absurd that we should
be compelled to call men from
their shops, their factories, their
offices and their professions for
such a purpose. This, however,
la npt all. The units of the Na
tional Guard were at peace
strength, which was only about
one-half the required strength.
It was necessary to bring In
recruits, for the most part raw
and untrained. Only a small
percentage of the regiments re
cruited up to war strength will
have had even a year's training
In the National Guard, which at
the maximum means one hun
dred hours of military drill, and,
on the average, means much
less. Men fresh from their
peaceful employments and phy
sically unprepared have been
hurried to the border for actual
service. They were without
proper equipment ; without
necessary supplies ; suitable
conditions of transportation
were not provided. Men with
dependent families were sent;
and conditions which should
have been well known were dis
covered after the event. And
yet the exigency, comparatively
speaking, was not a very grave
one. It Involved nothing that
could not readily havelbeen fore
seen during the past three years
of disturbance, and required
only a modest talent for organ
ization. That thla Administra
tion while pursuing its course
In Mexico should have permitted
such conditions to exist Is al
most Incredible. From Mr.
Hughes ppeech of acceptance.
PREVENTION OF
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
To control the present epidemic of
infantile paralysis, according to a state
ment issued by the United States
Public Health Service to-day, the chain
of infection between persons harboring
germs of the disease and the well mem
bers of the community should be
broken. Infantile paralysis is probably
caused by a very minute organism
found in the nasal, mouth and bowel
discharges of those who . have the
disease or who are carriers of the germ
without themselves suffering from the
ailment. All of the steps in the spread
of the infection are not known but if
this germ can be prevented from pass
ing from the infected to the well person
the disease will cease.
Infantile paralysis is not a disease of
recent origin. Sporadic or scattered
cases have occurred throughout the
country for many years but it is only
during the last decade that the infec
tion has assumed epidemic proportions
in the United States. The present epi-'
demic in New York City, on account of
its magnitude and virulence, has awak
ened the residents of many communi
ties to the danger of the importation of
the disease into their own midst. This
danger is real, but if due precautions
are exercised it is believed that the
epidemic will subside.
The actual control of the present
epidemic must be left to the city, State
and Federal health authorities. These j
organizations will properly quarantine
and care for affected persons, pre
scribe sanitary measures and limit as
may be necessary the travel of indi
viduals in order to protect neighboring
districts from the infection. Individu
als and communities, however, can do
much toward their own protection.
Poliomyelitis is probably spread di
rectly or indirectly, through the medium
of infective secretions. Account must
therefore be taken by communities . of
every means by which such secretions
are disseminated. Promiscuous expec
toration should be controlled. The
common drinking cup affords a method
for the interchange of material of this
nature and should therefore be abolish
ed. Rigid cleanliness of glasses and
utensils at soda fountains, in saloons
and other public places should be en
forced. Flies, roaches and other
vermin, by coming in contact with in
fective secretions, may possibly convey
them to our food and thus directly
bring about the development of disease.
Therefore eliminate insects. Street
and house dust bear a definite relation
to the spread of many infections and it
is not unreasonable to presume that
they may be a factor in the dissemina
tion of infantile paralysis. Maintain
strict cleanliness of streets, yards and'
alleys in order to prevent the breeding
of insects and other vermin. See that
all garbage and waste are properly
cared for and collected at regular and
frequent intervals. Guard all food
supplies, especially milk and other
perishable products, Digestive troubles
of children arising from the ingestion
of food of questionable quality may
lower resistance. Assemblies of chil
dren in infected localities are to be
discouraged, if not actually forbidden.
While the above measures are in a
sense general, and applicable to many
epidemic diseases, their importance
should not be overlooked.
Individual preventive measures may
be thus summarized:
Summon a physician at once and im
mediately notify the health officer of
the presence of the disease. If the
disease is present in the community,
medical aid should be sought when
ever a child is sick no matter how light
the illness; many cases of infantile
paralysis begin with a slight indisposi
tion. Should the illness - prove to be
infantile paralysis isolate the patient,
place a competent person in charge,
and reduce all communication with the
sick room to a minimum. Hospital care
is preferable, not only for the child but
in order to better safeguard against the
spread of the disease. The sick room
should be well ventilated and screened.
Nasal and mouth secretions should be
received in cloths, placed in a paper
bag, and burned. The clothing of the
child, the bed linen, and the excretions
should be disinfected in the same
manner as for typhoid fever, that is by
boiling, the long continued application
of 5 per cent carbolic, or other well
recognized disinfectant. The same is
true for dishes and drinking vessels.
Nurses should exercise the same pre
cautions as regards cleanliness of hands
in caring for infantile paralysis patients
as for those afflicted with other t infec
tious diseases.
A child may convey the disease to
otheri even after a lapse of several
weeks. For this reason quarantine
should be maintained for a considerable
period, usually from six to eight weeks
and the above precautions should be
adhered to during this time. Disinfec
tion of the room following 'recovery is
advisable.
. ALONG THE FIRING LINE
Announcing his decision not to run
as Democratic candidate for Governor
of Massachusetts the Hon. Andrew J.
Peters, now Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury, uses a fine restraint of lan
guage "Democracy under the leader
ship of our honored President," he
says, "should achieve another victory
this fall." The choice of verbs is
significant. It expresses the element
of doubt which has so largely contri
buted to Mr. Peters's decision not to
run.
A Washington correspondent dis
cussing the President's chances in the
election thinks it is "almost certain
that he will poll not only a larger vote
than he did in 1912, but a larger vote
than has any of the Democratic candi
dates before him." He will have to,
let us add, if he is to be elected. In
1912 Wilson received 6,293,019 votes,
the combined vote against him was
8,743,523, of which the combined Taft
and Roosevelt vote was 7,604,463. Wil
son received fewer votes in 1912 than
any Democratic candidate for the
Presidency in twenty years save only
Alton B. Parker, who enjoyed in 1914
the support of Mr. Bryan-which Wil
son is to have this year and which suc
ceeded in netting to Parker only 5,077,-
911 votes. Bryan three times got more
votes than Wilson did, while united
Republicanism three times snowed Mr.
Bryan under. United Republicanism
will do the same for Mr. Wilson. .
"Boston Transcript Mr. Redfield re
ports that the high cost of living in 1915
was reduced "1 per cent, net," but
didn't he mean "1 per cent, nit?"
Racine (Wis.) Journal-News The
Democratic Congress appropriate! mil
lions without a thought, while the post
office Department saves a few hundred
by crippling the service.
Washington (Pa) News Calling out
the militia may have been a political
move, but it will not stuff the ballot
box with votes for the Democratic
ticket.
The Democratic policy is "Buy where
you can buy the cheapest." The Re
publican policy is "Buy it Made-in-America."
vThe New York Sun believes that fu
ture historians will classify the diplo
matic notes of the Wilson administra
tion under tne heads, Vinegar, Pepper,
Sugar and Molasses, but never as Aqua
Fortis. ,Why not add Milk and Water
to the list?
Senator Reed of Missouri believes
and has told his colleagues in bebate
that if our troops are withdrawn from
the border the Mexicans will at once
begin to ravish American women, to
destroy American property and to mur
der American citizens. Yet the ad
ministration which Senator Reed up
holds has recognized a de facto gov
ernment in Mexico because of the be
lief that government was stable and
capable of maintaining order.
It is said that the only definite
speaking engagement which the Presi
dent has made is for Kentucky in Sept.
Last year the President wrote letters
into Kentucky and succeeded in re
ducing the Democratic plurality for
Governor from 31,331, as it was in 1911,
to 471. By going there in person this
year he ought to produce a Republi
can margin of about 25,000.
The recent hot wave seriously affect
ed the normal operations of Chairman
Vance McCormick's mind. In the midst
of unequalled meteorological torridity
he arose to exclaim that anyone who
sought to find a political motive in the
President's plan to hold the Guardsmen
on the border is "traitorous." Why so
hot, little man? Everyone knows that
the President has done nothing for
months and that he will do nothing for
months to come except as he has
weighed all the elements of political
probability and determined a course
calculated to end in his political ad
vantage. The President himself, if he
were to make use of that analytica
power which he has so freely applied
' in his study of the various bandits in
Mexico who have from time to time re
ceived his favor, would doubtless be
among the first to admit this. Mr.
Wilson is out to get re-elected if possi
ble -and to this end he "will omit no
word or act."
