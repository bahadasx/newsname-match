Detectives, police officers, the deputy city and county attorney, in fact

; As the Star-Bulletin goes to press Deputy Asch gave the ' Information
that an entirely new clue, involving the same suspect, had been discovered
and- was being developed. : '
Although excitement over the fate-of their countryman is running high
.among the Japanese residents and many have visited the jail to inquire for
the latest details, no friends or relatives have come to see Fujimoto. Mot
even his wife has called on him, the police say.
r Moto, "a Japanese chauffeur, ; was hacked to death, probably with a
; hatchet, and Tome,' his bride of a fe w weeks, fatally wounded at the J. B.
Castle premises In "Va1klkl early this morning. Both were employes at
; the Castle residence. W.; Fujimoto, brcther-In-law and guardian of the wo

they found the servants' room a veritable slaughter-house.

evidence of a terrific struggle.

MONEY-ORDERS OFI
Japanese Complain for Months;
Ask: Consul-General to
- Take Up Their Case :
MORRIS KE0H0KAL0LE, !
POSTMASTER, IS AWAY
Return Awaited of Weil-Known
Maui. Democrat, Delegate
to St. Louis oCnvention
-Complaints that money orders sent
to Jajjan through the postoffice at
Pala, Maul, have gone astray have
Lbeen under investigation for months
by the local postoffice authorities, u
was learned today. Up to the present
time no explanatioa' ot the reported
ld1sappearance of the money orders
has. befn reached by the investiga
tors, and both Postoffice Inspector T.
J. Flavin and Frank W. Vaille. chief
clerk of the railway mail service, said
today trat so far the probe has not
fixed - either responsibility or guilt. '
Morris Keohokalole,"' prominent
Democrat of Maui, and a delegate to
the recent Democratic national con
vention at St Louis, is the postmast
er at. Pala. and the 'postal authorities
are awaiting his return from - the
mainland to take, up with him the al
legations that 'money orders entered
at his office have not reached their
destination. . ' The . majority- of the
Democratic delegates .returned from
the mainland weeks ago but Keoho
kalole did not return wijh Ihem. "Na
tional Committeeman- J. H. WIlson
l said today that he does not know, the
i No definite statement . as- to the
amount of money involved was avail
able today. A' petition from Japanese
of Paia arrived yesterday, directed to
Consul-General MoroU asking that the
consul take the case up with Jthe post-
office people. - Six , petitioners sent
down their receipts from the Pala of
fice and declared that the money had
never beerf received in Japan.
'. From Maui Japanese comes the
complaint that missing 'money orders
amount to about jzuuu.; At xne nonu
lulu office the Star-Bulletin . was
formed today that a number of the
complaints were-not. accompanied by
receipts, so that' the investigatora do
not Ttnow how much money is thought
to be' missing. Tracing the money or
ders has been nr. ade difficult and the
absence of the postmaster has delayed
firar-hftnri in vstization at Pala.
' Inspector Fla1n says that some qf
tlie orders were issued at Pala . many
months ago. One case Is said to go
back to July, 4913, Tracing the paper
throush Washington as well as japa
nese postal officials has proved a slow

Dr. Doremu8 Scudder, pastor of Cen

to the pastorate of the Foreign church
in Tokio, Japan, tendered him Borne
weeks ago, according to intimations
which have reached the Star-Bulletin
from persons in close touch with the
affairs of the local church.
A communication from Dr. Scudder,
who is spending his vacation in the
Maine woods, was received In the last

to the congregation of Central Union
next Sunday morning, is believed to

well as the notification that he has
accepted the Japanese call.

cepted the call, to Japan could not be
officially confirmed today, although
Intimations from several sources
point strongly to the affirmative.
Dr. Scudder.is expected to return tc
Honolulu the latter part of this month.
