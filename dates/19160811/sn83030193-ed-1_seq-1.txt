wireless call for "Tclefunkcn Station,
New York," the mysterious call also
picked up by tho Sea Gate and Sandy
Hook wireless stations, and that, an
In the caso of tho latter stations, 'he
sender of the call had refused lo dls
close his Identity.
Officials at Qttnranttno had every
thing In readiness for tho reception
of tho Bremen In caso the report
was verified. Two United States tor
pedo boat destroyers, the Paterson

The destroyers have been on guard
Just outside the harbor since German

At the offices of the Atlantic Com

that without a previous knowledge of

"O'Connell ransacked tho bureaus
