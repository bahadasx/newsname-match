HOLBROOK, NAVAJO COUNTY, ARIZONA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 11, 1916.
G. M. BRAXTON, Proprietor.
EPOCHAL DAY FOR MASONS
Chalcedony Lodge Will Lay the
Corner-Stone of New Temple
in Holbrook Saturday, August
19 Ceremonies Will be Con
ducted by Grand Master of
Grand Lodge of Arizona.
Saturday, August 19. 1916, will
mark an important epoch in the
growth of Chalcedony Lodge,
Free and Accepted Masons. On
that day the cornerstone of the
new temple in Holbrook will be
laid by F. W. Perkins, grand
master of the grand lodge of Ari
zona. The ceremonies will be
held in the afternoon and may be
witnessed by the public. They
will be interesting and impres
sive and will be taken part in by
the officers of Chalcedony Lodge
and other members of the fra
ternity. The history of Chalcedony
Lodge No. 6, Free and Accepted
Masons, was written in 1913 by
Lloyd C. Henning, at present
serving his second term as mas
ter of the lodge. This history is
an exhaustive one and furnishes
very interesting reading. It
covers the years from 1887, when
the lodge received its charter
from the grand lodge, down to
the time the history was com
piled by Mr. Henning. From
this history it is learned that
Chalcedony was the first lodge
in Arizona to receive a charter
from the grand lodge. Prior to
the time this charter was issued
there were five Masonic lodges
in Arizona, all of which were
working under authority from
the grand lodges of other states.
These were the lodges in Pres
cott. Phoenix, Tucson, Globe and
Tombstone.
The charter members of Chal
cedony Lodge, which held its
first meeting on the evening oi I
February 1, 1887, under its new
charter, were: W. P. Vandevert,
T. S. Bunch. W. H. Burbage,
Glenn Reynolds, Wm. Adams,
Jr., C. F. Putnam, G. E. Kent
ner, Hugh Lynch, F. M. Zuck.
From the time it was founded
to the present time the growth
of the lodge has been steady, al
though in the early years, it was
Blow. Today there is an active
membership of 50; besides there
are a number of members from
other lodges who attend the
local lodge regularly.
The officers of the lodge are:
Lloyd C. Henning, W. M. ; W.
B, Woods. S. W,; J. H. Scorse,
J. W. ; Alfonse Blum, secretary;
Wm. R. Scorse, treasurer; Sidnev
SapD, S. D.; Geo. W. Hennessey,
J. D. ; J. C. Paulsell, tyler; James
Donohoe and F. A. Zuck,
stewards; L. D. Divelbess, mar
shal; Henry Warren, chaplain.
A few months ago plans for
the erection of a temple in Hol
brook were formed, and three
trustees were appointed to make
the necessary financial arrange
ments. These trustees are Wm.
R. Scorse, J. C. Paulsell and
Geo. W. Hennessey. Through
their efforts funds have been
secured wherewith the temple,
the cornerstone of which will be
laid on August 19, will be built.
The temple will be constructed
of pressed brick manufactured
in Gallup, N. M. Its cost will
be approximately $7,000, ex
clusive of the furnishings; for
the furnishings a sufficient
amount is now in the treasury.
M. T. Henderson, the contrac
tor, started work on the build
ing less than three weeks ago,
and the fact that it will be ready
for the cornerstone on the 19th
of this month is evidence that he
expects to push the work as
rapidly as possible to completion.

Contracts for Bridges Awarded
At the regular monthly meet
ing of the board of supervisors,
which began Monday and ad
journed Wednesday evening, con
siderable time was used in de
termining what bidders were en
titled to contracts for the nine
new bridges which will be con
structed in this county.
At the July meeting of the
board nine different firms had
submitted bids for the work;
some of these firms had filed
several different bids on each
bridge, and in all there were 1543
propositions submitted by the
nine firms. The work of figuring
out the different propositions was
passed up to the county engineer
by the board. The report of the
county engineer was ready for
the supervisors when they met
Monday, and upon this report the
supervisors awarded contracts for
the various bridges as follows:
The contract for the bridge
over the Little Colorado river at
Winslow was awarded to Mesmer
& Rice, of Los Angeles, Cal,, at
the approximate price of $30,000.
For this bridge the U. S. govern
ment has appropriated $15,000,
so that only $15,000 will be drawn
from the county funds for this
bridge.
Contracts for the other eight
bridges were awarded to the
Omaha Structural Steel Works,
of Omaha, Neb. The price is
approximately $40,000, which is
exclusive of certain approaches,
the contracts specifying that the
complete work must come within
the amount of money voted for
the purpose of constructing the
bridges. The locations of these
eight bridges are as follows:
Cottonwood Wash east of Win-
slow, Little Colorado at St. Joe,
La Roux Wash west of Hol
brook, La Roux Wash north of
Holbrook, Cotton wood Creek on
Keams Canyon road, Cottonwood
Wash near Snowflake, Little
Colorado river south of Wood
ruff. Outside of awarding contracts
for the bridges only routine
business'was transacted by the
board. The adjournment Wed
nesday evening being made to
Monday, Aug. 14, when the
board will meet to hear protests,
if any, against the proposed tax
budget.
Railway Strike Danger Passed
The threatened strike of the
400,000 railway employes of the
United States was averted Wed
nesday when the railroad bro
therhoods accepted a proffer of
the United States board of me
diation and conciliation to me
diate their differences with the
railroads.
Last week the members of the
four trainmen's unions finished
voting on the proposition of call
ing a strike. This vote was
practically unanimous in favor
of authorizing the heads of the
unions to call a strike. Nearly
all the railroads in the United
States were involved, and about
400,000 employees in the opera
ing departments.
Wednesday the representatives
of the railroad managers and the
presidents of the trainmen's
unions held a conference. The
latter, having had the power to
call a strike delegated to them
by the members of their unions,
were in a position to control the
situation. Realizing the gravity
of the situation the railway
managers suggested that the
national board of mediation be
asked to settle the controversy.
This the union managers finally
agreed to, and each side is now
i preparing to submit its demands
to this board.
Liver Trouble
"I am bothered with liver
trouble about twice a year,"
writes Joe Dingman, Webster
City, Iowa. "I have pains in my
side and back and an awful sore
ness in my stomach. I heard of
Chamberlain's tablets and tried
them. By the time I had used
half a bottle of them I was feel
ing fine and had no signs of
pain." Obtainable everywhere.

Kansas City Livestock Prices
Kansas City Stock Yards, 8-7-16.
Cattle closed last week 25 to
40 higher than Monday, due to
strong demand from both killers
and feeder buyers, and reduced
receipts. The good gain failed
to dislodge a big run to-day,
19,000 arriving, and prices are
strong to 10 higher. Pasture
men realize that they must de
pend on feeder buyers for com
petition on a great many of their
cattle, the same not having got
ten fat yet, and they are waiting
till the feeder demand becomes
more active.
Beef Cattle Proportion of
killing grades was rather light
today, and killer buyers had
good orders. Sales agreeably
surprised shippers who had cat
tle here last Monday and none
since then. Top fed steers
brought $10, fair to good fed
steers $8.50 to $9.50, Kansas
pasture steers $7 to $8.80, the
good ones $8 and upwards, light
weight Kansas and Oklahoma
steers $6.25 to $7. 25, fed Texas
steers in the quarantine division
$8 to $8.50, Oklahoma grass
quarantine division $6.25 to $7. 80
Cow stuff sold steady, best
natives $6.75 to $7. 50. grass cows
$5.50 to $6. 50, bulls $5. 50 to $6.50,
veals $9.50 to $11.
Stockers and feeders More
buyers came in after the middle
of last week, and not enough
cattle were here to go around
Wednesday and Thursday, though
the market closed with the usual
Friday weakness. Receipts to
day are more liberal, and there
are enough buyers present to
hold prices at 3teady. Most of
the stock cattle sell under $7,
and feeders at $6.75 to $7.50, a
few choice cattle around $8, stock
cows and heifers $5 to $6.75.
Hogs Last week closed with
a big advance, "and thfc-market is
5 to 10 higher to-day. Light
hogs have rushed to the front
topping the market today at
$9.85, medium weight $9.80.
heavy hogs $9.75 bulk $9.60 to
$9.80. Order buyers have good
orders for light weight hogs, and
local packers are also after them.
Receipts were 12000 today, four
thousand more than the early
morning estimate. The hog sup
ply has a way of overrunning the
estimate frequently, which sug
gests plentitude in the country.
However, recent competition has
been so strong that packers have
temporarily abandoned their ef
forts to work prices lower.
Sheep and Lambs Lambs ad
vanced 50 to 75 cents last week,
and sold strong to higher today,
receipts only 4000 head. Local
killers are in an extremity of
need for supplies, because of con
tinued light runs, and one packer
had to fill his orders with feed
ing lambs today, paying $9.50
for them, against a bid of $9.25
and $9.35 from a feeder buyer.
Utah lambs brought $11 and
$11.15 today, light weights and
15 to 25 cents under the limit of
the market for choice lambs, no
Arizonas here today, natives
$10.25 to $10.75, ewes $7 to $7.60,
breeding ewes $7.50 to $9.25.
