DEADLOCK IN
STRIKE DISPUTE
Railroads Demand Arbitration
Men Stand Firm for Eight
hour Day and Overtime
New York, Aug. 11. After deliber
ating the greater part of the night,
Commissioners William A. Chambers,
Martin A. Knapp and G. W. "W. Hang
er, of the United States board of
mediation and conciliation, were to
day no nearer a solution of the
"deadlock" in the dispute between
the four railroad brotherhoods of
the country and their employes than
they were yesterday. The efforts of
the mediators to avort a natlorf-wlde
strike were virtually at a halt, due to
the fact, it was reported, that the
railroads refuse to grant any conces
sion other than arbitration, while the
niPTt nprsisf- In tliplr firm Kfnnri fnr
the unequivocal granting of their de
mands for an eight-hour day and time
and a half pay for overtime.
A formal request for a twenty-four
hour delay In the negotiations wa
made by the federal board to the
union men today when they assembled
to receive the mediators, and it was
reported that the mediators, unless
there was an unexpected change In
the situation in that time, was pre
pared to suggest to President Wilson
that he intervene.
Mr. Hanger, who asked for the da
lay, took pains to point out, how
ever, that particular significance
should be attached to the sudden
change in their plana.
Question Involves Thousands.
"It must 'be remembered," he said,
"that the question involves ..thous
ands of railroads and thousands of
men and the mediators cannot arrive
at a pudlclous conclusion as to the
merits in the case until they have
thoroughly assimilated the situation."
Mr. Hanger added that the board
expected to continue Its deliberations
today and might reach a decision by
nightfall as to the time of the next
meeting with one or the other side
in tho dispute.
Men Refuse to Dally Long.
"We do not Intend," said W. S.
Stone, chief of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, "to wait very
long on the mediators. The tempera
ment of the men is such that they
would not have waited a minute if
we had not persuaded them to give
the mediators a chance. Personally,
I do not care to carry the strike vote
around in my pocket for any extended
period. It Is like a stick of dyna
mite." Since Its organization In 1913,
through an act of congress, and up to
September 20, 1915, the board has sat
on forty-seven cases between rail
roads and their employes.' In every
instance the board has succeeded In
securing an ultimate adjustment of
tho dlfllcultles, thirty-nine cases hav
ing been settled by mediation alone,
and eight by arbitration.
One report curront today was that
the railroad managers were ready to
propose a different form of abltra.
tion than that provided for under tho
Newlands' act, which the brother
hoods objected to. This was that in
stead of six arbitrators two ap
pointed by each side and two neutral
the board consist of four appointed
by each side and four or six neutral,
making a total membership of 12 or
14. This would make It possible
also for each of tho four brotherhoods
to havo an arbitrator on the board.

WILSON TO MAKE
SPEAKING TRIP
Washington, Aug. 11. President
Wilson practically has decided to
make a speaking trip across tho con
tinent. No details of the tour have
been arranged, but it was understood
today that his Itinerary will be
worked out within the next few weeks.
The president's advisers have been
urging him to make n number of
speecnes, out he has been witn-noiu-ing
a decision until the work of con
gress had progressed further. It was
known definltoly today, 'however, that
If present plans were carried out the
president would go to the Pacific
coast..
Senator Pholan today invited the
president to speak In California some
time during the campaign, but was
told no definite plans could be taken
up for at least two weeks.
One of the suggestions tor tho pro
posed trip is for tho president to
review some of the troops on he bor
der, but no decision on that has been
reached.
Invitations From Many Cities.
invitations from cities in all parts
of tho country are beforo the presi
dent, but none will be accepted until
they havo been gone over carefully
by Vance McCormick, chairman of the
i
Democratic national committee and
other Democratic leaders. The possi
bility that congress may remain in
session after September 1 is prevent
ing the president from making any
definite campaign plans. He wants
to make.no long trips from Washing
ton until after adjournment although
he has accepted 'an Invitation for a
brief visit to St. Louis September 20
The president will do much cam
palgnlng at his summer home at Long

DELAYING PRINT
PAPER INQUIRY
Washington, Aug. 11. The federal
trade commission today announced
that its Investigation into tho price
of news print paper is being delayed
to some extent by failure of news
paper publishers to send in answers
to the commission's questions as
promptly as It expected.
"Reports have ben received," said
the commission In a sia.tement, "to
the effect that some publishers are
hesitating to answer the commis
sion's Inquiries fearing that their com
plains will reach the paper manufac
turers and they will have their sup
plies cut off. The commission has
assured all such publishers that their
communications will be treated as
confident! al when requested and there
fore they need not have the least hesi
tation in furnishing the commission
with all the information in their pos
session." c
A large force of agents is now in

manufacturers, jobbers and others
and information gathered is being com

the steamship replying to tho fire
without hitting the vessel which had
shown no flag.
"Later boats wero lowered from the
steamer. After ascertaining that no
one remained on board the steamship
was sunk by tho submarine.
"Approaching the boats, the submar
