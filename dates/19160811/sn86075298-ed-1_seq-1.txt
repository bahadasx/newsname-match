HUGHES SCORES
PRESENT REGIME
Rep'!blican Nominee Flays Dem
ocratic Rule.
Detroit, Aug. 8.-Charles E. Hughes,
in the first set speech of his trans
continental trip, assailed the adminis
tration vigorously for its foreign pol
icy, for its Mexican policy, for ap
pointing men whom he termed inex
perienced in diplomatic posts and for
what lie characterized as "a raid upon
the civil service of the United States."
"He kept us out of war," Mr. Hughes
said. referring to the president, and
a I emocratic campaign slogan.
Tilt lie seized Vera Cruz. That was
war--very ignoble war. And it was
can o war over the bodies of thorn
li-ad soldiers; it was called a war of
"Talk about 'whiat is your policy:'
What is the president's policy-doas
any one know?
"Has the executive ever had a policy
for more than six months on the Alex
ican question? I repeat. Who knows
today what the policy of the adnilnis
tration will be three months hence?
"My friends, the trouble is that
this administration has written such
a record that, no matter what it says,
you do not know whether it will stick
to it.
Will Protect Our Rights.
"We have had an exhibition during
the past three years which, I confess,
fills me with a deep sense of shame. I
have not a particle of militaristic
spirit in my system, but if I am elect
ed president I will see to it that
American rights in Mexico are re
spected."
Mr. Hughes assailed the administra
tion's course toward upholding Amer
ican rights abroad during the Euro
pean war.
"When I say that I am an American
citizen," the nominee said, "I ought
to say the proudest thing that any
man can say in this world. But you
can't have that pride if American cit
izenry is a cheap thing, if it is not
worthy of protection this wide world
over.
"There is no man who could sue.
cessfully present to an American com
munity the platform that an American
citisen's rights stop at the coast line
and that beyond that American life is
to be the prey of any marauder that
chooses to take it."
The nominee cited the Republican
platform's declaration that 30,000 gov
ernment positions had been taken
from the operation of the civil service
law during the present administra
tion and declared that "that sort of
thing has got to stop."
Scores Trade Commission.
The federal trade commission, Mr.
Hughes charged, "was fairly emascii
lated with the law by the men, for
the most part, who were appointed to
places upon it."
Mr. Hughes also laid stress on what
he termed the need for industrial
brotherhood and closer co-operation
between employers and employes.
There was no capitalistic class, no
laboring class in prosperity, he said,
but the prosperity of the country or
its lack affected all citizens.
It behooves the men responsible for
the policies of the country, he said,
to look forward to the day when Eu
rope, at peace, would wage fierce com
nTercial competition with America
and to guard American workingmen
against that time.
Mr. Jllicges spent an extremely
busy day in the stifling heat of De
troit. Ilo made six speeches.
After lunch the nominee went to the
ball game. He shook hands with the
meribers of the Detroit and Philadel
phia American league teams and
watched part of the game.
Then he went to two big automobile
factories and spoke at each.
Between speeches he held many
conferences with political leaders,
shook hands with 2,000 persons and
found time for two short naps.
SLAYS FARMER WITH ROCK
Mott, N. D., Aug. 8.-Frank Luchow
ski, alias Frank Lang, an Industrial
Worker of the World, confessed, ac.
cording to the authorities, he killed
Louis H. Larson, a farmer whose body
was found concealed in a clump of
weeds. Lang, who is being closely
guarded In the local jail to prevent s
possible attempt by Industrial Work
ers to rescue him, declared that he
crushed Larson's head with a rock in
a quarrel. Farmers in the district
around Regent, hearing of Lang's al
leged confession, prepared to take the
prisoner from the jail and lynch him,
but abandoned the plan after assur
pnces from Mott authorities.
HON. E. H. COONEY AT
ROUND BUTTE MEETING
Hon. E. H. Cooney, editor of the
Great Falls Leader and one of the can
didates for the republican nomination
for governor of Montana. was in Ronan
last Saturday afternoon getting ac
quainted with republican voters, and
went out to the Round Butte school
that evening where he spoke before a
good sized crowd of the people of that
section. He was accompanied to Round
Butte by H. M. Rawn of Missoula, a
candidate for the nomination for clerk
of the district court, Mr. and Mrs. A.
J. Brower and Mr. and Mrs. C. F.
Rathbone.
B. F. Johnson presided at the meet
ing and C. F. Rathbone, Mr. Rawn,
Senator Brower and Mr. Cooney all
spoke, the latter being the principal
speaker and he devoted his time to a
discussion of questions now of interest
politically.
Senator Brower discussed state is
sues entirely and quoted from recent
reports of state oflicers showing the
cost of running their departments, all
of which the senator contends is (lone
extravagantly.
Mr. Cooney told his hearers "that he
expected to be nominated and elected
and promised an economical, business
administration in the event his ex
pectations were realized.
A number of Round Butte republi
cans signed membership cards to the
Ronan republican club and are awake
to the interests of the party in their
s:ction.
Mr. and Mrs. Joe Cernik entertained
the party of speakers and ladies at
dinner and those who partook of the
elegant spread all vote Mrs. Cernik an
excellent hostess and the manner in
which fried chicken disappeared vouched
for her ability as a cook.
WHEAT PRICES
SOAR VIOHER
Wheat prices have advanced this
week until at the present time the Ro
nan buyers are paying as high as $1.22
for No. 1, with other grades in propor
tion. There has been the wildest of
excitement on all boards of trade
during the week, with slight fluctua
tions but a steady advance in price one
day with another.
The principal reason for this rapid
and unexpected advance in price has
been the reports of damage to wheat
in many of the wheat producing states,
with rumors of a short yield in Canada,
owing to the lateness of the season.
The government report dated August
8, says there is a shortage this year of
200,000,000 bushels under the final fore
cast for last year of winter wheat, and
157,000,000 of a shortage in spring
wheat, a total shortage of 357,000,000
bushels.
All other grains show about the same
percentage of shortage and all grain
will be higher as aconsequence. Many
predictions are that wheat will go
higher this year than in any previous
year in 40 years.
The governmenh crop report above
alluded to gives the average prices for
Montana and the United States on Au
gust 1, this year and last, the first
figures being for this year and the sec
ond for last year, as follows:
Montana-Wheat, 100 and 101 cents
per bushel. Corn, 105 and 93. Oats,
40 and 48. Potatoes, 85 and 84. Hay,
$9.30 and $7.50 per ton. Eggs, 25 and
23 cents per dozen.
United States-Wheat 107 and 106.5
cents per bushel. Corn, 79.4 and 78.9
cents. Oats, 40.1 and 45.4 cents. Po
tatoes, 95.4 and 56.3 cents. Hay,
$10.70 and $11.02 per ton. Cotton, 12.6
and 8.1 cents per pound. Eggs, 20.7
and 17 cents per dozen.
STATE BAN IS EXTENDED
Pennsylvania Acts to Check Infantile
Paralysis.
Philadelphia, Aug. 8.-The state ban
against children under sixteen without
health certificates entering from New
York and New Jersey was extended
to Delaware and Maryland following
a conference here of State Health
Commissioner Dixon and Director
Krusn of the local department of pub
lic health and charities. The scope
of the quarantine was broadened in
order to prevent children from New
York and New Jersey entering the
state through Delaware and Maryland.
Four deaths and three new cases of
infantile paralysis were reported,
making a total of twenty deaths and
ninety cases in the city since July 1.

army apprcpriation bill submitted a
complete agreement.

The house provided on!y for five
capital ships.
Agreement was reached by the con

BLOOMER GIRLS4
RONAN ALL-SIARS 5
The game of base ball last Sunday
irom the small score would seem to be
the best game played here this season,
but such is not the case. There was
some good playing done but too much
grand stand stuff was pulled and too
many bonehead plays indulged in to
make the contest interesting.
Among the Bloomer Girls' lineup
were men players whom it would be a
pleasure to sign up to play with Ronan
another season-they were ball players
--but the girls were either afraid of the
ball or were too tired to try to play the
game. It was really four good ball
players against nine-some ball play
ers, some not.
Wood pitched for Ronan and when
the men were up to bat he smoked
them through and when a girl was up
he simply tossed the ball over, and at
that one home run was made by the
pitcher for the Bloomers, it being one
of the longest hits ever seen on the
Ronan diamond. For several innings
it looked like Ronan was in for a trim
ming but a series of hits and errors
placed them in the lead two runs and
this result was never changed. The
final score was 4 to 5.
GRAIN BUYERS ARE CON
TRACTING MUCH WHEAT
The Reservation Farmers' Grain Co.,
Beckwith Mercantile Co. and Stanley
Scearce, grain buyers, have been very
busy during the past ten days con
tracting with our farmers for their
1916 grain crop. So energetically have
they all been on the job that it is
stated much of the wheat to be threshed
here this season has already been sold,
at a price ranging from $1.00 to $1.15
per bushel.
Stanley Scearce started out one even
ing last week and' before he returned
home that night had bought over 40.
000 bushels, but much of this wheat
was last year's grain. atill held by the
farmers. Since that day he has con
tinued to buy until at present he has in
excess of 200,000 bushels contracted
for. One man sold him 18,000 bushels.
The Farmers' Grain Co. has pus
chased a good many thousand bushels
and are in the market for all the grain
they can get.
The Beckwith Co. also has contracted
much wheat and oats and are- scouring
the country for more. Farmers seem
to be pretty well satisfied with the
price, thinking over a dollar to be bet
ter than taking chances on a lower
market. Rumors that wheat would
reach $1.50 before Jan. 1, has not pre
vented a great many selling, although
a few still hold for the big price--or
less, if the market slumps.
HEADED FOR KAL
ISPELL ROUND-UP
Doubtless the fastest relay race ever
pulled off in the northwest will be wit
nessed on the Kalispell fair grounds at
the Kalispell Round-up for three days,
August 16-17-18, 1916. Jim Parsons
will be here with his famous relay
string that lowered the world's record
at Missoula, and "Sleepy" Armstrong
is on the way from Missoula. Charles
Allard and Dell Blancett will have re
lay strings in the big race as well as
one Cheyenne party. Five or six relay
strings will start for a big purse, mak
ing this one of the fastest races ever
run.
Charles Allard has just returned
from Cheyenne where he attended the
big Stampede. lie states that a lot of
the best performers in the arena will
be here from Cheyenne.
l)ell lIancett returned Sunday night
from Havre, Montana, where he con
tracted for the herd of long horned
Mexican steers that will be shipped to
Kalispell to be used in the Roundup.
Charlie Allard will have his herd of
buffalo in the fair grounds and part of
the herd will be used in the arena.
The night show will be one of the
main features of the Roundup. The
arena will seat three thousand people
and the dance pavillion will accommo
date three hundred dancing parties.
The Glacier Park Juvenile band of
130 pieces, boys from six to thirteen,
will be a big feature for three days.
The Glacier Park band of 30 pieces,
adults, will be in attendance also.
This will be the biggest show ever
pulled off in the state for 50 cents. The
night show will be 25 cents.
RONAN HIGH SCHOOL
TO BE REORGANIlED
The high school at Ronan is to be
re-organized this year on the six year
plan, which has been approved by the
state authorities. This means that the
seventh and eighth grades are dropped
from the elementary school and pupils
will step directly from the sixth grade
into the high school. Correspondingly
the high school period is lengthened to
six years. This is the six and six plan
so highly recommended by Dr. Clax
ton, U. S. Commissioner of Education.
This new method of organization was
kept in mind in planning the new
school house, which has been arranged
especially for a six year high school.
The large assembly room and study
hall 48x24 feet will have desks and
seats for all the pupils, but there will
be no recitations held in this room.
Three smaller rooms equipped with
seats alone will be used for the reci
tations. Besides, there is a large room
to be used as a sciencg labratory, a
library room and an office for the prin
cipal. The two school rooms to be
used for the fourth, fifth and six grades
are located in the west wing with a
separate entrance and cloak rooms, so
as to be in no way disturbing to the
high school.
The advantages of the new plan are
manifest. It makes possible the de
partment method among the teachers,
and so a larger faculty for the high
school. This year there will be four
high school teachers, instead of three
as last year, and corresponding greater
specilization by each teacher. For the
pupils the advantages are even greater,
Many of the pnpils in the seventh and
eighth grades are really of high school
age. They need the kind of treatment
and discipline that a high school pupil
gets, and not the routine discipline of
the ordinary grade room. They need
the opportunity of taking vocational
work such as domestic science and
manual training, which will now be
open to them two years earlier. They
are not so likely to be held back and
perhaps dropp' out of school because of
failure in one or two studies. There
will be no disturbing recitations going
on during their study periods.
The change means a bigger and bet
ter high school for Ronan. We expect
an enrollment of fifty; we ought to
have seventy-five. The material is here
for a large high school and for a first
class athletic teams.

TEUTONS SUFFER
FURTHER LOSSES
French Gain in Hem Wood and
on River So0mme
London, Aug. 8.-The Germans
have suffered further losses at the
hands of the French between the Hem
wood and the river Somme, losing, a
line of trenches and 120 prisoners and
ten machine guns, and also in the Ver
dun sector, where the French advanc
ed south of the Thiaumont work and
captured five machine guns and took
some houses in the western part of
the vila; e of Fleury.

Amid continuous heavy rains which
have turned the country into a quag

their strong offensive in Northern
Galicia and have advanced farther
forward their lines against them in
the Sereth and Graberki river region.
Russians Gain In Volhynia.
Also, along the Stokhod river, in
Volhynla, near the town of Zareoze,
the Russians have occupied Teuton
trenches, taking twelve officers and
200 men prisoners and capturing one
machine gun. In the Carpathians the
Germans report the capture of two
peaks from the Russians.
Constantinople reports gains for
the Turks against the Russians and
Petrograd admits at least one of the
claims-that the Russians have been
forced to retire under pressure to the
region east of Karmanshah, Persia.
A Russian attack north of Bukan,
on the Persian front, was put down
with heavy losses, according to Con
stantinople, and in Turkish Armenia
near Bitils and Mush the Russians
have been put to flight.
Violent fighting is in progress be
tween the Austrians and Italians,
especially around the Gorizia bridge
head, on the Doberdo plateau and on
the Lower Isonzo river.
MORGAN DOUBLES
HIS INHERITANCE
New York, Aug. 8.-According to the
completed appraisal just made the es
tate of the late J. P. Morgan was
worth $73,149,000, of which $53,684,
918 went to the present J. P. Morgan.
From what was learned the present
Morgan firm has made as tmuch money
during the past two years as the old
head of the house made during his
whole career as the recognized finan
cial and industrial leader of the Unit
ed States.
In the first place, under its contract
with the British government the Mor
gan firm has reeeived a commission
of 26 per cent on all munitions and
supplies purchased. Those purchases
during 1915 and 1916 will foot up not
less than $2,000,000,000.
Then the Morgan firm has received
a banking commission on all loans
placed. The loans now aggregate $1,
500,000,000.
