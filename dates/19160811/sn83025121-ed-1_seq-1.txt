Such, in brief, ll the summing up of
the result's of yesterday' fighting in
the keetern and western theater - of
the great wa,1,JUUt .witi: froat
the struggle ha died down to aa ex
change of tninor Jnfaatry attacks and
the i eonstant bombardment of tha
heaty guns on both tides of the long
trench line.
Make Minor Gains Only
Only in the neighborhood of tbo
bloody angle at Hem Wood have the
French to report gains. The fighting
in this neighborhood it reported in the
official communique last night as hav
ing been extremely heavy and bloody.
.I'jftt across the Homme, to the south,
tne Germans attacked during the day;
making use of the liquid fire gas.
They followed this assault with a
series of infantry attacks, whieh, ac
cording to the French aooountt of the
struggle, failed to effect their object,
and the Teutons were finally compelled
to fall back to their own trenches,
leaving the field strewn with their dead
end wounded.
At heretofore, the French machine
guns and superior artillery won the
day. The charging masses of the Ger
man troops were unable to come near
to the first line of French trenches,
owing to the perfect hail of shells from
the seventy-fives, and the bullets froin
the embrasured machine guns.
Attackers Buffer Heavily
In the official Berlin accounts of this
fighting and the struggle on the Homme
iu other sectors, the German general
staff declares that all of the allied at
tacks were repulsed with heavy loss
to the attackers.
Rut the real sensation of the day 's
warfare came from the Isonzo front.
There for months the Italians and
Austrians have been deadlocked.
Following their victory., in the cap
ture of all the defenses of Goriisia and
the occupation of the city, the Ital
ians are now threatening Trieste, the
main objective of all the campaign on
this front and the principal city of
Austria's Adriatic littoral.
Cavalry Chases Austrians
The army of the Duke of Aosta,
which has done signal work in prepar
ing the way for the present victory, is
now pursuing the fleeing Austrians on
the left bank ef tb Isonzo river. Cav
alry is being1 thrown out to drive in
the Austrian advance posts and heavy
masses of Italian infantry are follow
ing at a rapid rate.
This advance down the Isousui
threatens Trieste, which is reported te
be preparing for an offensive near the
city.
Gorizia, is virtually undamaged by
the bomburdment to which it was sub
iected. The Italians did not use their
heavy artillery to batter down de
fenses but employed strategy to take
the city.
Military Stores Taken
Before leaving the Austrians made
an attempt to destroy their large mili
tary stores and many buildings, setting
fire to the storehouses, but the Italians
made such quick work of occupying the
city that the fires were put out and
most of the stores saved.
It is also reported from this front
that the Italians have pierced the
Austrian entrenchments northeast of
Monte Han Miuhele and have occupied
Roachini.
A total of 12,000 Austrian prisoners

Labor Trouble
(Associated Press by Fsdsral Wireless)
NEW YORK, August 11. The Presi
dent will be called upon to participate
In the settlement f the differences be
tween the four great nation-wide
brotherhoods of railroad employes and
their employers unless the apparent
deadlock soon shows signs of breaking.
Federal mediators are at present un
decided when they will meet again,
Just what the next move will be is the
tubject of much anxious speculation.
. Nearly half million railroad em
ployes of all classes throughout the
country are endeavoring to enforce a
demand for em eight hour day with
time and a half for overtime. Rail
road officials have declared that the
granting of any such demand would
cost the railroads of the United Htates
more than one hundred million dollars
a year, besides revolutionizing the
present service system.
The gravity of the present situation
cannot be exaggerated. It does not ap
pear probable that the railroa Is would
concede anything like the domand;
made by their employes, many of the
lines claiming to have been forced near
bankruptcy by eeagreesienal legislation,
Government ofHelals do not Intend that
the dispute shall. resolye ltaclt into a
ttruggle of .' endurance between the
roads and the, met), with the- public
subjected to lost tad inconvenience.
It is s greed that the best solution is
to avert the strike itself and to that
end the government is bending all its
powers. It is generally conceded thar
brute force cannot solve the present
difficulty.

Damage Total Grows
The damage to property is consider
ably more than was origlnallyesti mat
ed and will amount to at least five
million dollars. Ten thousand persona
liuve been rendered homeless.
Flying to the bills for safety, able
to save scarcely anything except the
clothes on their backs, to abrupt was
their flight of necessity, thousands are
ramped on the hillsides and hilltops,
some in rudely exteLiporixed shelters,
others in tents provided by the state

any kind save what nature affords be
neath the trees of the slopes.

Constantly they inquire of those in

concerning missing relatives and
friends, and pitiful indeed are the
st cues enacted when newt eomes of this

Most of the refugees have been strip

For a distance of sixteen miles the

demolished homes, stores and other
structures, the havoc' wrought by the

to i ma gi ne how the ruin could have
been more complete.
It will take some time to examine
the mass of debris for the missing, but
w hen the sad work hat been brought to
