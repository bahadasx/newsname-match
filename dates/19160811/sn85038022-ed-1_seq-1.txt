The local rlvermen are expecting a
big river within the next few daya.
Thuy say that the river will go to
tweuty-flve feet probably. This will
shut down all work at the dam for two
weeks or more and will set back the
work a great deal. The cofferdam ia
flooded at a stage of about seventeen
feet. Preparations will probably be
made today for the high water. Tae
Kanawha River in West Virginia lias
reached a stage of fifty feet caused by
the heavy ralna. However these re
ports are unofficial and nothing defi
nite can be learned until the Federal
Government Issues a warning.
