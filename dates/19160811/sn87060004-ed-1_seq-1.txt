HOW TO KEEP WELL
DON'T DRINK
Dr.
W. A. Evans, Medical
Editor of the Chicago
Tribune, Says that Tem
perance is a Health
Matter
Heading his article 'Alcohol Versus
Health." Dr. W. A. Evans, in the
Chicago Tribune of August 1st. says:
"No health authority anywhere
advocates the use of alcohol as a
medicine, food, or beverage. Until
a few years ago health departments
were silent on the subject. At the
present time a considerable minority
of the health departments are actively
campaigning against drinking. Among
this minority are some of the best in
the country."
The contents of the - May Bulletin
of the New York City Health De
partment in opposition to the bever
age use of alcohol, Dr. Evans de
dares, "proves that it is bad from
every standpoint." He cites the re
search work of Insurance men as
proof that "moderate" drinking has
a distinctly bad effect upon life ex

TRAINMEN HURT
IN L&J. WRECK
Engineer Riordan and Fire
man Barnett Severely
Hurt When Train
S3 Ditched at
Slaughters
Several trainmen were injured, one
probably serious; four cars were de
molished and many passengers w6re
slightly bruised and shaken when L
& N. southbound train, No. G3, due
in Earlington at 4:30 a. m left the
rails at Slaughters early Wednesday
morning and plunged into the em
bankment. The accident was caused
by a broken guard on a switch just
north of the station.
The locomotive, after leaving the
track, plowed along the track tor a
distance of about 200 feet, tearing
down several telephone poles and
plunging into the concrete walk and
turning over. The next car to the
engine, a supply through mail coach,
telescoped into the rear of the engine
crosswise, while the second car jump
ed over the car and engine and piled
up about 200 feet in front. Four mail
clerks were in the car that jumped
anu it is a miracle their lives were
saved. The next two cars, an ex
press and a baggage car, crashed into
the first mail' car and engine and were
partially destroyed.
The most seriously injured train
man was-Fireman Chas. Barnett, of
Nashville, who was severely scalded
and suffered internal injuries. It is
thoutrht Harnett will die. The others
injured were: Engineer Riordan, Bag
gageman James Warren, Mail Clerk
Waldman, Loster, AldmonandLee
Harris, the last named living in Mad-
isonville. Of the latter, Warren suf
fered the most with a broken leg.
Arthur Hargrove, negro of Madison-
ville, a driver for John Long's Bak-
ery, was injured as was Oscar Reed,
negro, both passengers.
The negro passenger coach left the
track and bruised several occupants,
the white passenger coach directly
behind, also left the track. Only
slieht lars were experienced by the
occupants of the latter coach. Engin
eer Riordan was at first thought kill
ed, but was found on top of the en
gine where he had crawled through
after the accident. Barnett, the fire
man, was pinioned under the engine
for at least half an hour before being
released.
Lee Harris, of Madisonville, suf
fered a badly bruised leg and other
injuries and returned to his home im
mediately after the accident in an
automobile. The other badly in
jured persons were taken to the hospl
tal in Evansville.-
Two wreckers, one trom this city,
the other from Howell, arrived on the
scene about six o'clock. The only two
trains delayed were the Dixie Flyer.
No. 05 and No. 92. No, 05 arrived in
the city about 12 o'clock, carrying
part of 53's sleepers.
Dr. Frank Bassett, former presi
dent of the Kitty League, was a pas
senger on the train and assisted in
the rescue work. E. L. Wise, train
master, arrived on the scene early
and stated that in his 3 1 years' ex
perience with the L. & N. Railroad
on this division no passenger had ev
er been killed. This is quite a re
markable record.

SOME OF THE
MANY INTER
ESTING THINGS
To be Seen on the Bee's
All
River Trip to the
Mammoth
Cave
LEAVING SATURDAY AUGUST, ,26
When the Bee's party about foriy
strong, leave Evansville on Saturday,
Aug. 26th, on the steamer Evansviil;
they will stare on one of the most in
teresting 412 mile river trips in this
country. Among other things they
will pass through six locks as follows:
Lock No. 1 at Spottsville, Lock No.
2 at Rurmey, Lock No. 3 at Roches
ter, Lock No. i at Woodbury, Lock
No. 5 at Massye Springs. Lock No.
6 at Brownsville. In addition to the
novelty of passing through these
locks the party will have the oppor
tunity of viewing some of the most
magnificent scenery on upper green
river there is to be seen anywhere,
the huge masses of rocks are piled
up 20O feet bigh along the banks of
.the river reminding one of some of
the old castles in England and Scott
land described by Sir Walter Scott
in Waverly Novels. The delightful
scenery is not all, one of the chief
pleasures of a river trip is to gather
on the upper deck after supper and
watch the passing scenery by moon
light while enjoying tlie cool river
breeze and listening to sweet strains
of music from the band below.
On these river trips everyone is al
lowed to do as they please as long as
they please to do right. Everything
possible is done for the comfort and
enjoyment of all and it is just like a
bis house party. If you wish to
shoot turtles off the logs, alright;
you wish to dance, music is furnished;
if vou wish to play "500"' eo to it
if you wish to read, take kodak pic
tures, go in the engine room or up in
the pilot house, watch the deck hands
ride calves and pies down the bank
into the river, you are free to do so,
and nothing is said or thought about
it, as the boat crew from Capt Wil
liams down, want you tohave a good
time. When you get to the cave
your baggage is looked after and you
have nothing to do but eat breakfast
and get on your cave suit preparatory
to taking one of the routes.
If you have ever been in
Mam
moth Cave you will never forget it
If you have never .been you will al
ways regret it. It is one of the great
eit of nature's many great wonders

TRY IT! SUBSTITUTE-
FOR NASTY CALOMEL, , j
Starts your liver without mik
ing you sick and can not
salivate
Every druggist in town you
druggist and everybodys drnegis
has noticed a great falling-off in
the sale of calomel.
They all give the same reason.
Dodson's Liver Tone is taking
its place.
''Calomel is dangerous an
people know it, while Dodson
Lwer Tone is perfectly safe and
gives better result?," said a prom
inient local druggist. Dodson'ar
Liver Tone is personallp guar
anteed by every druggist wh
soils it. A large bottle costs G
cent, and if it fails to give easy
relief in every case of liver slug
gishness and constipation, yon
have only to ask for your money
back.
Dodson'i Liver Tone is a pleas
ant-tasting, purely vegetable-
remedy, harmless to both child
ren and adults. Take a spoon-1
ful at night and wake up feeling
fine; no biliousness, sick head
ache, acid siomacli or constipated
bowels. It boesn't gripe or causo
inconvenience all the'next day
like violent -calomel. Take a dnao
of calomel today and tomorrow
you will feel we&k, sick and nau
seated.
Dou't lose a day'd work! Taket
Dndson's Liver Tone instead and
feel fine, full of vigor aud am
bition.
