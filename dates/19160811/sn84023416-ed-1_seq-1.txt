ON THE MEXICAN BORDER
Former Island Pond Boy With
the Vermont National Guard
Writes of Army Life Pat
rolling the Interna
tional Boundary
Indio Camp, Eagle Pass, Texas.
Editor Herald:
Dear Sir: As a former Island Pond
boy I have been trying to find time
to write to a great many of my
friends living in Island Pond, but
not thru intentional neglect I have
been obliged to omit a large number
from my correspondence. Since I
entered the University of Vermont
two years ago, I have been a member
of Co. C, 1st Vt. Infantry, and with
the rest of the National Guard was
called into Federal service by the
President on June 18. In view of
the interesting events following that
date I have decided that the best
way to reach the people back home
is thru the columns of the Herald.
For the purpose of enlightening the
people of Island Pond as to the real
work of a "tin soldier," I will give a
brief account of our experiences
since "joining the army."
After a stay of a week at the mo
bilization camp at Fort Ethan Allen,
we were ordered to entrain for serv
ice on the border. Considering our
lack of training and general green
ness, the work of breaking camp
and entraining went forward very
rapidly so that June 21st saw the
entire regiment in day coaches, bound
forEagle Pass, Texas.
On our way down we received a
hearty welcome from the people in
every town thru which we passed.
At Binghamton, N. Y., Salamanca,
N. Y., Oelwein, la., and Denison,
Tex., we were given particularly
enthusiastic receptions, with bands,
lemonade, fruit, etc, So far as we
can learn we were the only National
Guard regiment so far to be trans
ported to the border in day coaches,
with no provision made for sleeping.
We were crowded three men to two
seats, and our food consisted of one
cup of coffee and one corned beef
sandwich three times a day. All
other National Guard regiments
which have arrived in Eagle Pass
have come in Pullmans.
Eagle Pass is a city of about six
thousand population, located on the
Rio Grande. It is a port of entry,
and railroad centre for a large agri
cultural section to the north. About
ten thousand soldiers are stationed
here now with more troops arriving
daily. Near the camp of the 1st
Vermont is the camp of one Kansas
and two Maryland regiments, besides
the camps of several regiments of
U. S. infantry, cavalry, and artillery.
Immediately after our arrival we
were issued two hundred and ten
rounds of ammunition and told to
sleep with our clothes, rifles, and
equipment within easy reach. We
slept for three weeks on the ground,
but now cots have arrived so we are
more comfortable.
, The country is a semi-desert, the
only vegetation being cactus.chapar
ral, sage-brush, and mesquite. None
of these shrubs grow to more than
a few feet high. There is no grass
or trees in this vicinity. All agricul
tural operations are carried on on
irrigated land; Oil wells and coal
mines are in operation to the north
and west of Eagle Pass.while several
large ranches are located nearby.
During eleven months of the year
rain is almost unknown, the rainy
month being July. The "sandstorms
which occur every day or two are
the most disagreeable part of our
life here. Every time atmospheric
conditions are just right we get a
strong wind up the river from the
Gulf of Mexico which kicks up a
great deal of sand and fills our tents
and bedding full. Eagle Pass has
stores and theatres which are as
good as one would expect to rind in
a New England town of its size.
About three-fourths of the people
are negroes and Mexicans. It boasts
one newspaper.the "Eagle Pass Her
ald" which is issued bi-weekly. The
river on each side of Eagle Pass, is
patrolled by U. S. soldiers and the
international bridge, which connects
the town with Piedras Negras, the
Mexican city just across the Rio
Grande, is closely cuarded. No acts
of violence have been committed in
this section by bandits, yet owing to
the concentration of Carranza troops
in Piedras Negras, Eagle Pass is one
of the most closely guarded points
along the border.
The Vermont troops had been in
Eagle Pass two weeks when Col.
Reeves was ordered to prepare to
relieve regulars on outpost duty
down the river. In leaving our
camp we were leaving many of the
little comforts which had been pro
vided for us by the company funds
raised by the friends back in Ver
mont, such as shower baths, electric
lights, etc., yet when we learned
that the 1st Vt. was the first Nation
al Guard regiment to relieve regulars
on outpost duty, and that this honor
was conferred upon us because we
were considered the most efficient
militia regiment on the border.there
was not a man who was. not glad to
go. The first battalion consisting
of companies A, B, C, and D, was
the first to move. Co. C, the com
pany to which I belong, struck tents
and loaded its auto trucks in exactly
two hours. Each company was
divided into garrisons for two or
more ranches, Co. C being divided
between Indio Ranch and Windmill
Ranch. We have about thirty men
at each of these posts and a few
recruits which are left at Camp
Shafter.
Indio Ranch, where I am stationed,
contains 2130,000 acres, or to make
its area more striking it is nearly
one-fourth as large as the state of
Vermont. It has a frontage of
forty-five miles on the Rio Grande
and the river is about one mile dis
tant from our camp. One thousand
acres are under cultivation, most of
it being in Kaffir corn, which is used
to fill sixteen concrete silos, each
holding about five hundred tons.
ThS' s'iIjs, I am told.coat one thous
and dollars each. Eighteen thousand
head of cattle, eleven hundred mules
and five hundred horses are kept on
the ranch. The ranch is owned by
the Indio Ranch Corporation which
is made up of three Jews, one living
in San Antonio, one in St. Louis, and
one in New York, and its appraised
valuation is three million dollars.
In closing I would say that the
boys are very comfortable and are in
good spirits. Our work consists of
twenty-four hours guard and fortv-
eight hours off. Every letter that
we get from home is a bright spot
in our lives which helps us forget
our little troubles, such as bad
water, mosquitoes, snakes, horned
toads, centipedes, and other creep
ing and crawling reptiles too numer
ous to mention, besides, last but not
least, the heat which keeps the
thermometer between 110o and 120o
in the shade.
I would like to hear' from all of
my friends in Island Pond, and
though I may not be able to answer
all of them, Jheir letters will be
greatly appreciated. We all hope
to be back in time for college next
fall but the chances are that 1917
will still see us on Texas soil if not
in Mexico.
Yours truly,
Corporal John T. R. Andrews,
Co. C, IstVt. Infantry,
Eagle Pass, Texas.
In camp at Indio Ranch.
P. S. Earl Lang and Raymond
Pease, both former Island Pond boys
are in Co. D, of St. Johnsbury. I
am sure .that both of them would
like to be remembered to the people
of Island Pond,
July 27, 1916.
