MAKE A TOUR
OVER NA
President Practically De
cided Upon Cross coun
try Speaking Trip.
URGED BY ADVISORS
Has Been Withholding De
cision Awaiting More Pro
gress in Congress.
"Washington, Aug. 11. President
Wiison practically has decided to make
a speaking Trip across the continent.
Xo details of the tour have been ar
ranged but it is understood today that
his itinerary wiil be worked out with
in the next few weeks.
The president's advisers Lave been
urging him to make a number of
speeches but he has been withholding a
decision until the work of congress had
progressed further. If present plans
are carried out the president will go
to the Pacific coast.
Senator Phelan today invited the
president to speak in California some
time during the campaign but was told
no definite plans could be taken up for
at least two weeks.
One of the suggestions for the pro
posed trip is for the president to re
view s';iqo of the troops on the border,
but no decision on that has been
reached.
Invitations from cities in all parts
of the country are before the president
but none will be accepted until they
have been gone over carefully by
Vance McCormick, chairman of the
democratic national committee and
other democratic leaders. The possi
bility that fongreinuwMw'!'Afn in ses
sion arter Sept. 1. is preventing the
president from making any definite
campaign pljns. He wants to make no
long trips from Washington until aft
er adjournment, although he has ac
cepted an invitation for a brief visit
to St. Louis, Sept. 20.
The president will do much cam
paigning at his summer home at Long
Branch, X. J., where ho will receive
delegations.

Berlin, Aug. 1J, (via London,
.::. p. m.) Austro-Gcrman troops
in the region of .Monaster ska, tit
points on the Dniester and in the
Bystritza river reirions of Galicia
have been compelled to give way
because of the superiority of hos
tile forces at some places, says
today's war office statement, Coun
ter attacks brought the engage
ments to a standstill and a regrouping-
of the- Teutonic forces is
now taking place.
Tetrngrad, Aug. 11, (via London, 5:25
p. m.) -The Russians are advancing
on the Sereth river in Galicia, the war
office announced today. They have
also entered the town of Monasterzys
ka, northwest of Stanislau.
The Russians have reached the

the right hank of the Bystritza river, a
branch of the. Dniester, which joins
that river near Mariampol.
Imjiortanee of Victory Grows.
Home, Thursday, Aug. 11. The im
portance of the Italian successes
around Gorizia is becoming more evi
dent hourly. The battle is continuing
behind the city over a front of about
12 miles long. The Austrians have
retreated along the railroad in- the
direction of Dornberg, eight miles
southeast of Gorizia, and over the na
tional highway to Schon pass, six
miles east, and are now attempting to
reform their front on a line from Yi
pacco to Tarnova,
Meanwhile the Austrians are at
tempting to take the offensive at
Monte Nero and other points on the
Italian front, but thus far have been
unable to divert the Italians from
their operations behind Gorizia.
Popular enthusiasm is at high pitch
throughout Italy. Congratulations are
pouring in from all parts of the world
to King Victor Emmanuel and General
Cadorna. The king and the commander-in-chief
have been particularly
pleased by messages from Italians in
the I'nited States.
The third army under command of
the duke of Aosta has won high praise
as well a3 much sympathy on account
of its losses. The duke, before the
battle began, called on his army to
right and win "in the naDiaaL.your
mothers, your wives, your sisters and
your country."
Writers Describe Battle.
Paris, Aug. 11. "Entering Gorizia
by the Leone, the sight that meets
the eye is most striking," telegraphs
the Petit Parisen's correspondent on
the Isonzo front. "It was here that a
furious battle was fought for posses
sion of the city. The houses are half
destroyed by shells or riddled with
bullets.
"The ground is strewn with bodies,
uniforms, helmets and rifles. The ar
tillery duel continued above our heads
and enemy aeroplanes whirled across
the sky, shot at by our gunners, while
in the distance could be heard the
furious clacking of machine guns.
"The spectacle before us was su
perb. Over an iron bridge our bat
teries passed at a trot. The Austrian
artillery sent towards them whirl
winds of shells, the smoke from which
completely blotted out our columns
from time to time. When the smoke
blew away one could see the batteries
still proceeding on their triumphant
way. The men of the line regimont3
veiled, wept and clapped their hands
in their enthusiasm. Some of the gun
ners fell wounded, but the bridge was
passed ami our guns began to get near
the enemy.
City Life is Aormal.
"As soon as one passed the first
houses and got into the city the as
pect of things changed completely,
normal life was resumed, and if it
had not been for the echoes of the
struggle, one would not have known
that a battle was in progress nearby.
"In the f'arso, one of the principal
streets, a big cafe was open, filled
v.i'h officers, soldiers and civilians,
the troops and citizens fraternizing
freely in their joy. Our flags floated
from the windows of all the houses.
"The population has almost all re
turned. The Austrians forced the in
habitants to leave the city itself, but
they remained scattered throughout
the environs of the place awaiting the
retreat of the enemy to make their
wav back."
Wants to Keep First Submarine.
cv York, Aug. 11. Dr. Peter J.
Gibbons, who has purchased the first
.submarine built from the plans of
James Holland, offered to give the an
cient craft to the city, historical so
ciety or museum that could show the
best right to It and that would guaran
tee to preserve it.
"We bought it because we did not
want to see it lost as was Wright's
first aeroplane, Fulton's steamboat and
the steamboat built by Gibbons in
Philadelphia SI years before Fulton
built his," said Dr. Gibbons.

Message From Vessel Believed Off
Sandy Hook Refuses to Divulge
Identity Is Sub Belief.
New York, Aug. 11. Wireless ob
servers were puzzled early today by
signals received from an unidentified
vessel apparently somewhere off San

The fact that the stranger refused to
disclose the identity of the vessel led
some of the wireless operators to be
lieve they were at last in communica

their marine glasses seaward at day
break but no submarine was in sight
The mysterious signals had ceased.
While in communication with shore
stations a few hours eariier the ves

North German Lloyd steamer Breslau,

GREAT ADVANCE
English Get
Protests on
U. S. Shipping
London, Thursday, Aug. 11. Amer
ican shippers to Holland are bombard
ing the British government with pro
tests aa a result of detentions of car
goes consigned ta the Netherlands
Overseas trust. It Is understood here
their protests may he backed by dip
lomatic action at Washington.
In April, last year, replying to a
protest from Washington over the de
tention of the American steamship
Seguranca, the foreign office made the
following promise:
"While his majesty's government
does not require cargoes to be con
signed to the Netherlands Overseas
trust, they do accept a consignment
in that form as proof that the cargo
is intended for a bona fide consump
tion in Holland." This was widely
circulated in the United States.
In the last two months between 35
and 40 consignments to the Nether
lands Overseas trust have been held
up, some in bonded warehouses in
Holland, awaiting action, while others
have actually been placed in prize
courts. American shippers complain
that the British government has not
adhered to its pledge and it is expect
ed they will seek the assistance of the
state department.
DECREE REVIVES
COAL INDUSTRY
Final Action of Commission On Rate
to Kansas City Sets Illinois Min
ing Camps Buzzing.
Springfield, 111., Aug. 11. With the
announcement that the interstate com
merce commission has refused to sus
pend a new low rate for coal ship
ments from central Illinois to Kan
sas City, Mo., recently published by the
Chicago and Alton railroad, coal op
erators of Sangamon and adjoining
counties are preparing for a revival of
the coal industry which has been at
low ebb for more than a year in this
locality.
When the Alton on July announced
a rate of $1.25 a ton on coal from cen
tral Illinois points to Kansas City, op
erators of the latter city immediately
filed a protest with the interstate com
merce commission. After a four day's
hearing, attended by operators from
Springfield and Kansas City, and after
Senator Stone and Governor Major of
Missouri had exerted their influence
to have the rate suspended, the com
mission declined to take any action.
Springfield operators, returning today
from the hearing, declared the rate
would become effective Aug. 24 with
out further opposition.
The rate formerly was $1.90 a ton on
fine coal, but there was no traffic, the
rate being too high to make shipments
to Kansas City profitable.
At the same time the James S. Pea
body coal interests, which own many
mines in central Illinois, announce tlvj
reopening of many of their properties
which have been closed for rnonth.i.
Mining towns depopulated during the
shutdown, are buzzing with prepara
tions for the return of their popula
tions and consequent new business.

the United States board of mediation

er a solution of the "deadlock" in
the dispute bteween the four railroad
brotherhoods of the country and their
employers than they were yesterday.
Efforts of the mediators to avert a
nation wide strike were virtually at a
halt because, it was reported, the rail
roads refuse to grant any concessions
than arbitration, while the men insist
upon the unequivocal granting of an
eight hour day and time and a half
overtime.
A formal request for a 24 hour delay
in the negotiations was made by the
federal board to the union men today
when they assembled to receive the
mediators. It was reported that the
board, unless there was an unexpect
ed change in the situation in that
time, was prepared to suggest to
President Wilson that he intervene.
