Charges Made That England

Petrograd, Aug. U.- For the pur
Vow of bringing about closer rela
tions between Ruula and the United
fitatee, American Ambaaasdor Francis
baa approached the Ruulan govern
ment with the auggeatlon that a di
rect cable be laid between Ruula and
America. The proposal waa made In
an Informal way. Prancla suggested

ligation by the state department. It
was learned today following United
Presa Correspondent 81m ma' despatch
from Petrograd. Every cue haa been
carefully probed, but thu far the
department has been unable to prove
the charges are true.
The protests came from American
firms. They claimed that orders
cabled from Russia have been held
up by British authorities, and some
times even turned over to British
firms, who, In turn, submitted bids
o the Russian concerns.
State department officials argued
' the situation If proved aa perhapa
the most flagrant Interference In Am
erican rights thus far.
In case the atate department ran
, prove England guilty of the offense
v charged, the strongest protest thus
far made against English trade
practices will be eent to the English
. government, for, officials say, such
a situation would be Intolerable.
In this connection, It waa confirmed
today, that Ambassador Francis has
been negotiating for better cable
facilities between Russia and the
United States. Thus far the depart
ment haa taken no official hand In
' the cable situation, though officials
' say they are watching the matter
with Intercut.

London, Aug. 11. Indications that
the long expected offensive of the

here this afternoon.

The town of Hallts, lying at the

has been described as the key to any
operation against the Oaliclan cap
ital from the southwest
It was expected that Letchitsky
would first take Stanlslau and then
move northward against Hallts. The
Austrian were prepared for a most
stubborn resistance at the Hallts
bridgehead, where they expected to
blow the crossing or the Dnelster and
check the advance by the czar's troops
against Lemberg.
Letchitsky evidently took the ene
my by complete surprise. Thowlng a
force across the Zlota Lipa river,
northeast of Stanlslau, be began a
swift advance against Hallts on the
north bank of the Dniester. The of
ficial statement lasued yesterday
placed the advance guards 'thirty
miles from Halttz. Today's official
statement reported the Dniester

is directly north of Stanlslau, and
only 10 miles from HaHts.
