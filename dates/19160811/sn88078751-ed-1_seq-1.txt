Capture of Gorltz by the Italians
Opens the Door For an Attack On

Pressing Forward In Eastern Gall
cla French and British Gain In the
Bomme Region.
London, Aug. 10. Important suc
cesses continue to mark the vlgordus
drives of the allies on the French,
Italian and Galician fronts.
In Austria the Italians havo captured
Hie ty of Gorltz, twenty-two miles
northwest of Triest; In Galicia, the
Russians in quest of Lemberg have
further carried out their endeavors to
ward the capture of Stanislau from
the Austro-Germans, while In France
the French and British forces in the
Somme region have attacked and won
additional points of vantage from the
Germans.
The capture of Gorltz by the Ital
ians seemingly is as Important a gain
by the entente allies as has yet been
attained in their present offensive,
the city being the door through -which
the Italians may now pass in an en
deavor to carry out their long cher
ished idea of capturing Triest, Aus
tria's big seaport at the head of the
Adriatic sea.
In the fall of Gorltz, where Rome
says the Austrlans were completely
routed, the Italians inflicted heavy
casualties on Its defenders, took more
than 10,000 men prisoners and cap
tured considerable quantities of war
requisites.
The city of Gorltz has a population
of about 30,000 and Is the capital of a
province. It lies on the east bank of
the Isonzo, surrounded on three sides
by mountain ridges and peaks, which
constitute a natural fortress. It Is the
point of convergence of important
railways, and the key of the whole
plain opening up to the Invasion of
Austria from the west
In earlier attacks upon the great
Austrian stronghold the Italians had
sacrificed- thousands of lives. The
Austrlans, too, have suffered enorm
ously In repelling Italian attacks.
Russia Makes Gain..
The Russian General Lechltzky has
driven his wedge further Into the Aus-tro-German
line near Stanislau. cap
turing positions east of that Import
ant city through which the railroad
leads to Lemberg and the town of
Tysmlenltsa. Northeast of Tysmlen
Itsa the Russians have crossed the
right bank of the Koropice river and
captured a number of Important posi
tions west of viesnoup and southward
along tho Niznioff-Monasterzyka rail
road, making the Russian meuace
against Hallcz greater. To the soulh
of Tysmlenltsa the Russian advance
has reached to Stokovohela.
Berlin admits the retirement of the
Austro-Germans behind the NlsInofC-Tysmienlts-Ottynia
line, but says that
in the Carpathian region heights held
by the Russians near Jablonltsa and
Vorocht and west of Tararov were
captured by the Germans and that
strong Russians attacks, In the Dela
tyn district were repulsed.
North of the Somme river In France
the Australians have pushed back tho
Germans near Pozleres 200 yards o-ver
a front of COO yards, while the French
have driven out the Germans from a
trench recently captured from them
north of the Hem wood and reoccu
