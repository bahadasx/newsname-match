LORDSBURG WILL RECEIVE CON
SIDERATION IN TROOP MOVEMENT
COMMITTEE INTERVIEWS GENERAL BELL IN EL PASO SAT
URDAY. TELL OF LORDSBURG AS TRAINING CAMP
Lordsburg has been personally
represented before General George
Bell, Jr-, at his headquarters in the
Mills Building in El Paso. Sat
urday afternoon Joseph A. Leahy
and Faris V. Bush were received
by the general and arguments
heard in favor of this city as a
military training camp.
General Bell recalled the cor
respondence in regard to sending
militia troops here and seemed fa
vorably impressed with the advan
tages Lordsburg had to oiler.
However, it was his opinion that
in the future the troops would be
consolidated at a certain point
and not be distributed at places
along the border. He stated that
never since the Civil War had
there been a general troop move
ment and that it would now bo the
object of the war department to
give the militiamen assembled on
the border, this training.
Although deeply submerged in
the affairs of his department, Gen
eral Bell was considerate in re
ceiving the Lordsburg representa
tives and hearing their requests.
He stated that this city would cer
tainly be remembered in case
there were any further troop move
ments in tho way of establishing
training camps.
The aides of General Bell's of
fice were very courteous in dis
patching the committee to the of
fice of the commanding officer.
The attaches as well as the gen
eral himself were as democratic
gentlemen as one would care to
meet.
A general outline of camping
conditions at Lordsburg has been
prepared and is on file for the
government at any time they care
to make investigations of this city
as a training camp.
Camping grounds have been
located on tho Crocker addition
south of town within easy access
to both the Southern Pacific and
A. & N. M. Railroads. Water an
alysis has been furnished by the
Lordsburg Power Company, whose
mains run to the proposed camp
site. The Southern Pacific Com
pany has offered tho use of their
hospital and have also solicited
the furnishing of water to tho
troops in case there should be a
shortage in the city supply-
Every indication points to Lords
burg as a future militia training
camp should the government estab
lish any more in the southwest.

a glorious reward is the culmina
tion of their efforts.

MILL FOR 85
CERTAINTY
Company Making Tests. Plan for
Treatment Plant
That the 85 Mining Comnanv
will soon begin the erection of
an ore treatment plant at their
camp three miles south of Lords
burg is the belief of those close
ly associated with the company.
A test mill has been established
by the 85 Company at the Texas
School of Mines Building at Fort
Bliss, Texas. J. W. Crowdus is in
charge of the plant and is making
complete tests of flotation and wet
method of treating tho 85 mine
ores. Representatives of several
of the largst flotation unit manu
facturers and patentees have visit
ed the mine and have gone into the
problem of concentrating the pre.
A number of shipments of ore
have been made to various test
plants, and it is belioved that the
correct method of treatment will
soon be solved.
The company is at present cbn-
necting the main shaft of the mine
with the newly cut 500 foot level.
An upraise is being made from
the winze sunk some time ago. A
sump has been excavated and ev
erything is ready for work on the
new level.
KVith this development of ore
reserve and the erection of a treat
ment plant the 85 mine is destin
ed to become one of the largest
producers of copper in the state.

"POLITICAL
SPEEKINGS AS
IT IS SPOKE"
HARDIN MAKES A
SPEECH ON BORDER
Follwing is a piece of fertility
from the brain of Walter Chesser,
well known Lordsburg humorist.
Walter says that when B. B. Own
by and E. B. Venable went on
their campaign tour in the south
ern part of the county, they took
along Postmaster Mart Hardin to
address an assemblage of Mexi
cans gathered at tho XT ranch.
By mistake Mr. Hardin got across
the line and made this speech to a
gang of Carranza soldiers:
(Walter says this is a verbatim
copy of the speech as read olT by
the orator in mention.)
L ccaros and Caballeros: I pi
ence you all sabe tio Sam El
