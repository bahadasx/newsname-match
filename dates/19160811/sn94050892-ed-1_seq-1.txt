A
GLOBE. Ariz.. Aug. 8. On condi-
, tton he marries before January 29.
1917. Theodore E. Miller, prominent
welterweight wrestler, known to sport
fans all over the southwest as "Foxy"
Miller, will receive a bequest of $150,-;
000. Notice of the rich legacy, which1
is to be his own on one condition was
received by Miller on July 29, in a let
ter from a New York law firm, inform
ing him of the death recently at
Frankfort, Germany, of Matt Dorschid,
a wealthy uncle. The uncle's will pro
vides that. Miller is to receive the leg
cay only upon condition that he is
married within six months of the day
he receives notice of the bequest.
Miller, who has not seen his uncle
since 1886, remembers only vaguely
the trip to Europe and the visit to his
uncle's house at Frankfort. He does
remember, however, that he was the
decided favorite of nls uncle, who of
ten expressed the desire to see him
grow to manhood and be happily mar
ried. Miller, who is now managing
a crew of salesmen in Arizona repre
senting an eastern pillow top and pho
nograph company, declares that he
will lose no time in finding a suitable
wife in the time allotted him to make
his choice. Unknown to his uncle he
, was married several years ago, but
was freed of matrimonial entangle
ments some time ago. He is there
fore, free to carry out the provisions
of his uncle's will. With the legacy,
which he is confident of securing.
Miller declares he will quit the wrest
ling game, and settle down to more
serious business. The present job of
salesman, he says, is a profitable one,
' andhe expects to "use his fortune to
develop the business in which he Is
now engaged.

Deputy Sheriff Wilson is expected
to return from Clifton to Globe to
night with C. Sciawaia, a Greek mer
chant of lower Miami who is wanted
here on a charge of passing a bad
check upon William A. Sprague, the
Globe restaurant man. The Greek's
friends say that upon his 'arrivel
from Clifton it will be found that

the reason that Sciawaia is not only
possessed of a store in Lower Miami

BABBITT ELECTED PRESIDENT
OF COCONINO CATTLE GROWERS
Flagstaff, Aug. 9. At the sixth
annual session of the Coconino Cat
tle Growers' association, Wm. Babbitt
was elected president and H. B. Em
bach secretary. Among the big works
of the association has been the erec
tion of a 58 mile wire drift fence,
which has been turned over to the
forest service. The association pas
sed resolutions of protest ' against
higher taxation and against a raise in
shipping rates proposed by the
southwestern railroads .
LEGISLATORS ARE POORLY PAID
From statements of members of the
last State legislature it is evident that
there are quite a number who do not
wish to be returned and therefore
are not entering the race at the pri
maries. It seems to be the common
wail that $7 a day is not enough pay
for law-making. Some who served
the 123 days of last session had to
borrow money to return home on.
Others had only a new suit and a few
dollars to show for their time, while
the majority just broke even.
Where-the legislators' pay goes to
la not known, but-it goes some way
according to those who are experl
, enced. There are no cabarets in
Phoenix and very few high priced
amusements. The hotels give the
law-makers special rates and meals
are cheap. Notwithstanding all of
these facts, the legislative member
usually returns to his home poorer
than when he left.

DOUGLAS INVITES
PRES. WILSON
Effort Being Made to Have Him Come
Here After Speech at El Paso.
DOUGLAS, Aug. 8. On behalf of
the citizens of Douglas, the chamber
of commerce, through Secretary Os
car K. Goll, have extended an invita
tion to President Woodrow Wilson to
visit this city and deliver a speech.
Secretary Goll this morning sent the
letter of invitation to Joseph P. Tu
multy, private secretary to the presi
dent. President Wilson will speak in El
Paso October 14, the opening day of
the annual meeting of the Interna
tional Irrigation congress, and the
day on which the new Elephant Butte
dam will be formally opened. It is
understood that the president will go
from El Paso to San Diego, though
just what route he will take has not
been ascertained. It is hoped that he
can be persuaded to come to Douglas
and remain for several hours, or at
least long enough to deliver a speech.
Douglas has never yet had the pleas
ure of entertaining a presdient of the
United States, though it has been
favored with the presence of one or
two near-presidents of the United
States and several prseidents of Mex
ico. CLAIM 'REPUBLICANS ARE
REGISTERING AS DEMOCRATS
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 7. From all
parts of Arizona Democratic com
plaints have come that Republicans
have been registering as Democrats,
merely to vote at the primaries, sup
posedly for George Olney as against
governor Hunt. This practice is
frowned upon by the Republican cen
tral committee, as taking from' the ap
parent strength of the party. In re
sponse to a number of requests to
change the political rating of regis
tered voters, county recorder Vinson
has declared in the negative, with the
exception made of Progressives, who
now are without a party.

TO JOIN CROSS AT FRONT
PHOENIX: Leaving friends and
sweeheart behind, and moved by a
strange psychic power which she is
unable to resist, Miss Erma Deane, a
beautiful young woman who for the
past several months has made Phoe
nix her home, departed for Portland,
Ore., where she is to take boat for
Vladivostock, journeying from there
across the Siberian plains to the Rus
sian front, where she will enlist as a
Red Cross nurse under the colors of
the czar.
Father Die In England-
Ted Goode, who left Clifton two
weeks ago for New York City from
where he was to have taken boat for
England, is expected home the latter
part of the week. Before embarking
he received a cable from England to
the effect that his father, who had
been ill for some time, had passed
away, and on account of being unable
to reach England in time for the
funeral he decided to abandon the
trip.

ARIZONA LABOR MEN MEET
IN TUCSON; 100 PRESENT
TUCSON, Aug. 7. The Arizona
State Federation of Labor is meeting
in Tucson this week, with about 100
delegates present. The past year is

circles, with great gains in member -
ship in Bisbee, Clifton, Morencl, Globe J'.
"Miami and Oatman. Several camps

paralyzed, rendering him unfit for
further duty. This happened at Dun

ABORT FINISHED
County Recorder Ellis has submit
ted the following figures of registra
tion for the county up to date. The
registration as it now stands is prac
tically complete for the primaries,
only a few stragglers yet to be heard
from in the different precincts. Re
corder Ellis expects to go to York
next week and complete the registra
tion at that place and with what few
may drop in from time to time it is
thought that the list will be changed
but little.
Clifton has registered the largest
number and a glance at the table
will show that the democrats outnumber-the
republicans 10 to 1, this
being accounted for from the fact
ti:!t a great many of hepublica-i f.iir'.
have registered as democrats and
thus cut down their ratio consider
ably. Morencl comes next with the
democrats naturally predominating,
while in all the precincts those of
other faiths are in the minority.

APACHE HIGHWAY
IS CONSIDERED
BY FORESTER
Favorable Replies Received by Board
of Supervisors of this County Re
garding Co-operative Plan For Clif-ton-SpringerviJIe
Road. .
That the Board of Supervisors of
this county is taking a lively interest
In securing from the Department of
Agriculture an appropriation for the
construction of the highway between
Clifton and Springerville, traversing
the . Apache National Forest, money
for which purpose was made avail
able. by Section 8 of the Federal Aid
Road -Act, is evidenced by the cor
respondence which recently passed
between A. L. Terry, Clerk of the
Board and the Forestry Department
and also with "" our representatives
and the Department of Agriculture.
Immediately following the passage
of the bill by Congress appropriating
money for building Forest Highways
on Forest Reserves in conjunction
with adjoining counties, the Board of
Supervisors instructed the Clerk to
again notify the Department of Agri
culture, the Forestry Department and
our Representatives at Washington,
that Greenlee county was ready and
willing to cooperate with the Forestry
Department in the construction of the
Clifton-Springerville highway. The
first action along this line was
taken by our Board of Supervisors
more than a year ago when the ap
propriation hill was pending before
Congress . .
The Board of Supervisors has re
ceived replies from these communi
cations from which we take the fol
lowing extracts: -
Senator Marcus A. Smith writes:
"I beg to assure you that I am in deep
sympathy with the proposition, and
will lend any possible assistance to
the cause. We have succeeded in
getting an appropriation which will
ultimately amount to several million
dollars to the State of Arizona, under
what is known as the "Good Roads
Bill." There ".are . also in the Post
Office Bill some appropriations from
hich -Arizona -will - --retjeive- certain -funds.
" ' I have " also jjist reported
from the Committee on public Lands
a Bill giving to each of the States
500,000 acres of non-mineral, unpat
ented lands to aid in the construc
tion of roads. I hope to be able to
pass this bill through the Senate at
this session." .
Representative Hay den writes: "I
enclose herewith a copy of a letter
that I just received from the Forest
Service which contains an opinion of
the Solicitor of the Departmetlt of
Agriculture on Sec. 8 of the Federal
Aid Road Act. I trust that the in
formation contained therein will be
of value to your Board of Supervis
ors in applying for a share of the
appropriation that has just been
made for national forests roads. I
am aovised that the Forest Service
is preparing the regulations under
which Section 8 of this Act will, be
administered. The office of Public
Roads is also at work on the regula
tions that will govern the adminis
tration of the other parts of this
law. I shall be glad to send you
copies of these regulations as soon
as they are obtainable."
Senator Ashurst replies as follows:
"During my various visits to Greenlee
county you and many other represen
tative citizens called my attention to
the necessity for the construction of
roads leading from the Clifton-Mc-renci
district to the north, through
the large, unbroken pine forests
and other regions of the north. In-
j deed the necessity and suitability of
such iouJs impressea !rseii npon my
nncd w tn such" Intensity that during
this hist session of the b4th Congress
I have devoted a large amount or
time and attention to the Good
P.oads bill: and tus Western Sena
tors by frequent coi'ere'iee and d:?i
gnt work were ab'o to secure an ap-pr'njiiai'-on
of $l,0JO.t"J0 each year
for the next ten years for the jur-
pese ot constructing roads and trails
in fcat'cnal Forests. It is indeed
with n uch pleasare that 1 am able
to fdvise you that the Good Roads
Bill has been signed by the President
and that there will be available for
the fiscal year beginning July 1,
1916. $71,500.00 for building roads
that are not on National Forests and
there will be-available for this fiscal
year about $100,000 additional for
building roads and trails in National
Forests. I am glad that you are
manifesting the intention of taking
this matter up with the Department of
Agriculture at once.
A. F. Potter, Acting National for
ester at Washington, writes: "No
definite action has yet been taken
towards selecting projects that will
be constructed from the money made
available by Sec. 8 of the Federal
Aid Road Act. The Forest Service
however is engaged in preparing rules
and regulations for carrying out the
rjumoses of this section. it is tne
intention to submit these to the Sec
retary at as early a date as possible
in order that action may be taken
under the provisions of the bill. In
the meantime the District Foresters
have been instructed to prepare ten
tative lists of projects and recom
mendations for construction under
the terms of the Bill."
C. F. Martin, Acting Secretary of
Agriculture at Washington, replied to
the letter from tne Boara as iohows
The Forest Service Is now engaged
in the preparation of rules and regu
DEATH OF ARIZONA
JUSTICE IS
1URNED
Every City Honors Memory of Late
Judge Edward Kent, Who Died In
Chicago.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 8. Every
city in Arizona practically joined with
this city in mourning the death, early
this week, of Judge Edward Kent, .
in Chicago, where he succumbed to
the harships of an eastern journey.
Hemorrhage was the direct cause of
his death. Yesterday every city In
Arizona paid the former chief justice
of the state supreme bench farewell
tribute when his body was laid to rest
in his old home in Maine.
In Phoenix every office in the state
house was closed during the" after;
noon out of respect to the deceased.
Several stores closed their doors for
one hour during the funeral services .
in the Maine home. The flags on
the state house, the city hall, the fed
eral building, the county courthouse,
several clubs and lodges and the down
town business houses were at half
mast throughout the day. i
At Tucson, according to word re
ceived here, court adjourned for two
hours during the afternoon. The
offices of the University of Arizona
were closed for the hour of funeral
service, and the flags of the city and
county public buildings were lowered
half way. )
Similar tribute was paid in Bisbee,
Douglas,' Globe, Prescott, Yuma, Flor
ence, Jerome and other smaller cities
where Judge Kent was known. Every
paper in the state commented liberally
on the death and many gave over
their editorial columns to expressions
of grief at the loss the state has sus
tained. . ,.
Morencl at Last Breaks Jinx
In last Sunday's ball game on the
local diamond the Morencl boys turn
ed the tables and gave Clifton the
beating of their young lives. 'It's a
sad tale, mates, and the dtb!ng was
so thoroughly and artistically done
that to chronicle the steps which led '
up to thf final eJaaehter.-jrcnli'only
prolong the agony of the defeat. Mo
rencl was an easy winner with a
score of 15 to 4 at the end of the .
game and she has vindicated herself
in the eyes of the Hill City fans and
In the flush of this great victory
they have forgotten the many pre
vious defeats administered. The
Clifton boys 'claim they had become
groggy from the intense heat and.
completely lost their heads, but rum
ors are to the effect that they just
naturally suffered from cold feet
and could feel the chastisement com
ing. ,
The truth of the matter is that the
local team labored at a disada vantage'
that but a small number of the
regular team played, and the places
of the regular men were filled by
old players who had been inactive
for so long that they could not find
their base ball legs. The Morencl
boys claim that the Clifton aggreg
ation see the hand writing on the...
wall in the form of complete anni
hilation in the future , at their hands
and that they have consequently laid
down. Morenci has her second wind
and was after Clifton with blood in
her eyes, intending to more than even
up matters before the end of the sea
son. However, her plans have been
frustrated according to reports that
the regular Clifton team will play
no more this season. The majority
of the regular players have good
jobs and work seven days in the
week and when they lay- off to play
ball on Sundays they lose the day's
pay. Therefore, when it comes to a
showdown between bread and butter
and base ball, the former comes under
the wire a good winner and from
present indications it would seem that
the team has disbanded for the re-
malnder of the season. A few!
games may, however, be played with
a pick-up nine, but if so the pep and
ginger will be lacking and the sport
will have lost its interest for the
fans.

these completed at an early date. In
the meantime the District Forester at
Albuquerque, New Mexico, is prepar
ing a list of projects and preliminary
reports to be pjeaented for conmde.-
ation. A copy of your letter has
been sent to him and he will take
the Apache road into consideration
in preparing his list of projects.
Owing to - thj importance of tne
Clifton-Springerville road to this sec
tion The Era would suggest to the
Board of Supervisors and Greenlee
County Chamber of Commerce the ad
visability ot sending a representative
from this county to the office ot the
District Forester at Albuquerque to
urge his recommendation ot this pro

sruction be started out of the first
- funds available.
