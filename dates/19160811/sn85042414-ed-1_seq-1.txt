DEMOCRATS AGREE.
Washington, Aug. 11.—A ten per
cent net profit tax on the manufac

•greed upon by democrats of the

posed In the house revenue Bill.
Washington, Aug. 11.—A net profit
excise tax on all manufacturers sell
ing goods to foreign governments as
a substitute for the munitions tax in
the pending revenue bill is being seri
ously considered by Democrats of the
Senate Finance committee. It prob
ably will be agreed on for submission
to the Decomrattc caucus.
The tax on munitions of war in
cluding copper products, as proposed
In the House bill, has been giving
Democratic Senate leaders consider
able trouble. They have been told
by experts, however, that the sub
stitute virtually agreed on would not
constitute an export tax and would
be constitutional. It is expected that
the proposed plan would apply parti
cularly to manufacturers who have
mad* large fortunes out of the Euro
pean war and would add many mil
lions to the revenue of the govern
ment.
The committee agreed to an
amendment which would authorise
the president to take retaliatory ac
tion against nations which prohibit
tfcfc Importation of any article, "the
product of the soli or Industry pt the

health or morals." The president

To Speak at
Billings Tonight.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D., Aug. 11—Although

the approach of the special.
Mr. Hughes said In part:
"I enter upon this campaign with
a deep sense of responsibility, with
a profound desire to be of the great
est possible servloe to the American
people.
"We stand for the protection of
American interests. Our opponents
have derided the principle. They have
again and again voiced their derision,
Now as they confront the crisis that
is sure to be upon us at the close of
the European war they are not very
sure. They are prepared to admit
that you cannot say that in this coun
try we can get along without some
measure of protection.
Not the Party.
"But they are not the party to giv°
any sound application of the protec
tive prinoiple. They do not believe
in it. They are opposed to It on every
hand. With regard to a tariff they
are a party without principle, for you
could not exactly call them still what
they were
year or so ago, advocates
for a tariff for revenue only and I
am afraid- they would not be for pro
tection now. Nobody knows Just what
they are."
Mandan raye the presidential-ca$
dldate another, ovation.
."I desire to see" said the former
Justice, "the business of the American
government conducted in a business
like manner, not for partisanship, not
for favor, not in an incompetent way,
but conducted impartially and com
petently under the most approved
leadership. I propose that the men
appointed for office, shall be fit for
the office to which they are appointed.
I propose that the government shall
be economically, not wastefully ad
ministered, and I propose that the
American name shall be honored
throughout the world, because we
stand firmly for the maintenance of
American rights-"

M'KENNA SCORED
IN LOWER HOUSE
London, Aug. 11.—Reginald Mc
Kenna, chancellor of the exchequer,
was subjected to criticism in the
house of commons yesterday on the
ground of over reliance upon treasury
bills, his critics arguing that the
large amount of ship bills outstand
ing constituted a danger and that the
government ought to have issued an
other war loan.
In the course of his reply the
chancellor claimed that Great Brit
ain was able to borrow abroad at
much lower terms than any other
belligerent power. He estimated the
nation's total indebtedness at the end
of the present fiscal year to be £8,
440,000,000. From that amount, said
the chancellor, the nation was en
titled to deduct £800,000,000, lent to
allies and dominions of the empire,
the sum left being a burden It could
well sustain as it was virtually bal
anced by the present national Income.
In fact, he declared. Great Britain
was In the position of a man whose
income was £5,000 and whose debts
amounted to £5.000, which was not
an alarming position.

STANISLAUS
WITHIN RANGE
OEJtUSSIANS
General Letchitzky's Forces
by Rapid Movement are
Near City.
Petrograd, Aug. 11.—The town of
Stanislau, in Galicia, is already with
in the range of the Russian guna. The
Russian general, Lietchitilcy, losing no
time to follow up his victory at Tys
mienitsa, has pushed westward along
the railroad and westward along the
wagon road, and in the latter direc
tion has approached to within six
miles of Stanislau. Simultaneously he
has commenced a drive across the
Koropice river and the formation of
a- new line of advance north of the
Dniester.
Hitherto Gen. Count von Bothmer
had enjoyed more or less protection
for his right on the Tarnopol posi
tion from the flooded. Dniester. The
appearance of .an offensive north of
the Dniester, which has already car
ried the Russians as far west as the
crossing of the railroad at Niznloff,
20 miles east of Stanislau, injects an
entirely new element into the situa
tion. With Monasterzyski seriously
flanked, Gen. von Bothmer finds him
self with 5en. Letchitzky in the rear
of his advanced position along the
Strlpa and in close touch. The Aus
trians are vainly striving to stem this
new advance by desperate counter
attacks, in which troops engage in
hand-to-hand encounters, but appar
ently with the net result always fav
oring the Russians.
The totalling of Gen. Letchftiky's
prisoners during the ten days' opera
tions shows that he has taken up
wards of 15.000. and it is estimated
that 10,000 more men were put out
of commission. This would bring the
grand total of prisoners to Gen. Brus
siloff's credit since early in June to
402,000.
FEWER CARS AND
ENGINES IN USE
Chicago, Aug. 11.—There were 7,
342 fewer freight cars and 815 fewer
locomotives in service in the United
States at the close of the fiscal year
1915 than at the close of 1914, says
the current number of the Railway
Age Gazette, "notwithstanding the
natural growth in the demand for
railway equipment from year to
year."
These figures, the publication says,
are shown in the annual statistical
statement of the interstate commerce
commission.
"In only one other year since 1890
has the number of locomotives shown
a falling off from the previous year
and in only three years during the
last twenty-six has the number of
freight cars in service shown a re
duction from the number of the pre
