"On the .next: day, the 9th,- the bom

which were sent out to reconnolter. re
ported splendid results, particularly be
tween Oppaochiasella and hill 77, east
ofMo/ifalcone. Here the Austrian line
".was the strangest sight. They used the
t, walls of gardens, copings of wells and
natural caverns of rocks. The line de
aoended from hill 208 to the north, as
far as a mile east of Oppacchlasella, to
Jamiano. The enemy had made *ev
era! series of trenches facing in every
i~ direction which made the defense of
position easy. Two of the most lm
... portant positions were the triangular
redoubt and another position called
Fortlno, which were furnished with
waohine guns. It was against this part
.*.• of the front that the Italian artillery
was directed yesterday with good re
sults.
Austrian Defences Demolished.
'X followed the battle yesterday
jl- from a point between Novavas and
Vllianova. It was a fantastic sight.
The Austrian trenches were converted
into heaps of rubble by the big shells,
which shot columns of smoke and dust
jt -'SOO feet In the air. At 10:30 reports
ff came that tho the trenches and barbed
vlrs entanglements had been wiped
out, the enemy were hidden in caves
j, awaiting the Infantry attack. The
artillery opened afresh on the second
and third Austrian lines. A colleague,
who was present in several wars, de
clared he had never seen such a spec
tacle of destruction.
"The Infantry attacked at 2:S0 with
splendid
a
I
dash and the triangular re­
doubt ujd Fortlno fell after a des
perate struggle. The enemy went
down everywhere,' notwithstanding a
stubborn resistance. After a few hours
ijftghting at, Novavas a thousand prison
ers were taken, among whom all Aus
trian nationalities were represented.
We obtained proof that instead of
withdrawing troops, the Austrlans had
sent reinforcements to defend the
Carso."

Boston, Oct. 12. The Boston

the fifth game of the series and
therefore the world's championship,
having defeated the Brooklyn Na
tional Leaguers four out of five
games played. Shore,'who defeated
Brooklyn once in the serie*, came
back today and repeated the trick,
holding the opposing team to three
hits. The scors: R. H. E.
Brooklyn 1 3 2
Boston 4 7 2
Boston, Oct. 12.—The aniversary of
the discovery of America by Columbus,
observed as a holiday here, coincided
with the fifth game of the world's
series between the Brooklyn Nationals
and Boston Americans. Thousands of
persons? freed from their labor, started
early for the. Braves' field. The great
est crowd in the history of baseball
was expected.
It was a last trench fight Brooklyn
prepared to make against the Red Sox.
While the thoughts of the players
turned in part to the money of the
series, which will exceed that of any
previous year, the thought of the pros
pective spectators remained fixed on
the players and play. Batteries came
in for first consideration.. Today the
element of uncertainty in this connec
tion was largely removed In the minds
of the fans.
"It will be Smith for Brooklyn and
Shore for Boston," nearly all agreed. As
they exchanged opinions about the fires
lighted outside the Braves field, the
fans could figure on no other pitcher.
Smith was held to be Robinson's "best
card." Shore was still held worthy of
Carrlgan's faith, while Ruth was ex
pected to be held In reserve-for possi
ble use tomorrow.
Shore at Disadvantage,
In the event that Shore slipped and
Ruth' tatled. Manager Carrigan.. still
held Leonard against the possibility, of
a last.game flsbt.
In the forenoon'the day was not en
tirely suitable, for Shore's best efforts,
a frosty morning putting the North
Carolina school master at a disadvan
tage. But It was prophesied that
southerly winds would prevail this aft*
eraoonv The lineup for today follows:
Boston—Hooper, right field Jlnvrln,
second base Shorten, center field
Hoblttsel, first base Lewis, left field
Gardner, thrld base Scott, shortstop
Cady, oatoher Shore, pitcher.
Brooklyn—'Myers, oenter field Dau
bert, first base Stengel, right field
Wheat, left field Cutshaw, second
base Mowrey, third base Olson,
shortstop Meyers, catcher Pfeffer,
pltoher.
Immense Crowd Present.
Columbus day brought. some 40,000
or more persons out this afternoon to
see what Boston hopes will be tjxe
game which will return the Red Sox
a winner over, the Brooklyn Nationals
!n the fifth contest of the world's
series.
All Boston turned out today. Hun
dreds made their way to the Braves
field to obtain the best points of vant
age in the unreserved stands.
The sun shone brightly and helped
temper the chilly wind. The two
teams came early today to the ground
and had a long batting practice.
Larry Gardner, the home run hero
of the series, whose four base drive
broke Brooklyn's back yesterday, came
in for a lot of applause when he came
upon the field.
Manager Carrigan l^ad Pennock and
Wyckoff out on the mound pitching to
the Boston batters, while Mails and
Agpleton tossed them up to the Brook
lyn batters. Both Shore aiid Ruth took
part in the Boston battlhg practice,
while Pfeffer and Smith, the two
Erooklyn pitchers, participated in the
batting practice for Brooklyn.
The fielding of both teams In prac
tice was lively and Brisk. Shore
warmed up for Boston while Smith
and Pfeffer'got into condition .for
Brooklyn. The crowd looked like a
record breaker.
The batteries for Boston_ were an
nounced as Shore and Cady for
Brooklyn Pfeffer and Meyers.
First Inning.
Brooklyn—Myers fanned on three
pitched balls. Cady threw out Daubert
at first taking his easy roller in front

New York, Oct. 18.—It was figured
out today that 1126,92«7, the players'
snare of the present world's series, Is
the largest sum ever divided in any
world's series. Sixty per cent goes to
the winner. If Boa ton wins the series
each of the twenty-six members of
that club will -receive' 83,332.94 and
each qf the Brooklyn club $2,715.41. If
Brooklyn should win each of the twen
ty-four players would pocket 4,073.01,
which would set, a new record for the
amount won bjr individual players In
any one world's- series.

games this year, has been nearly 3.000
less than last year, the receipts in 1916

New York, Oct. 12.—Indication
that an American naval patrol has
been placed on duty on the north
Atlantic coast was given today
when Captain Macdonald, of the
steamer Numamar ,In from Cuban
ports .reported that oft the Jersey,
coast, about 6 o'clock this morning,
an American destroyer dashed up
thru the mist and circled his ship
several times. The captain said he
broke out the national colors and
the destroyer withdrew.
Washington, Oct. 12.—While no im
mediate steps are In contemplation for
the actual establishment of a naval
neutrality patrol along the Atlantic
coast as a result of the German sub
marine raid, the navy department has
completed a plan to put It in operation
if the campaign continues.
The entire destroyer force assisted
by light cruisers, navy tugs and other
auxiliary craft, will be employed to
protect American territorial waters and
to prevent the establishment of any
bases ashore.
Tho possibility of 'mobilizing the
force of privately owned motor boats
along the coast, which have been en
rolled with their orews as a part of
the naval reserve, was first considered,
but various obstacles were encountered.
Naval officers and men have been as
signed to reserve ships If necessary.
Situation Clears Up.
The whole submarine situation, both
as to the recent raid on the 'New Eng
land coast and the broader question of
agitation In Germany for a ruthless
resumption of the warfare, shows Bigns
in official quarters of having practically
cleared up, No new developments are
reported agd no new disturbing Infor
mation Hals come to the state depart
mejdt, according, to official*..
The navy department today received
a report from Rear Admiral Knight at
Newport giving detailed -accounts of
the commanders of four steamers sunk
by a German submarine offv-the At
lantic coast
No Trace of Kingston,.
Rear Admiral 'Gleaves, commanding
the Atlantic destroyer flotilla, reported
Uday his personal belief that no
evidence has been found that a shjp' of
that name was in the vicinity.- The
admiral's report follows:
"Destroyers continued search from
midnight Tuesday. It Is my personal
belief that there was no steamer King
ston or Klnstonlan, the steamer Knudt
son having been understood to be
Kingston.'"
The captain of one of the sunken
chips said he had hailed a passing
vessel later destroyed and understood
lier name to have been Kingston. The
Knudtson was destroyed by the sub
marine in that vicinity.

in Sentiment.
Chicago, Oct. 12.—"Germany believes
the United States is pro-Engllsht jind
'wouldn't give a continental' If diplo
matic relations between Germany and
this oountry were sovered. Moreover,
a majority of the German people favor
a virulent submarine. warfare against
England, regardless of what the United
States might do."
This was the message that Fritz
Glogauer, American oltlzen, former
editor of the Chicago Abendpost, and
more recently a resident of Munloh,
Germany, brought to Chicago yester
day.
The German iFeeling.
"The feeling In Germany is very bit
ter against the United States," be
"If-the submarine question had
left to a vote of thtpeople of Germ
they-would have vdted to continue the
enmpaign, regardless of the United
States."
Dr. Glougauer had no criticism to
make of the admlnistbitlon of affairs
by Ambassador Gerard at Berlin.
"Some papers In Berlin and other
parts of Germany charged Ambassador
Gerard with unfairness," he said, "but
none of these papers ever substan
tiated Its charges, and a majority of
the papers—and the German people
have no complaint to make against the
ambassador.
No Eyes on Election.
"Germany Is not interested tn the
result of the American election," he
continued. "The German people feel
America as pro-English. They believe
the war would have ended long ago
but for the American aid to the allies.
"The German people generally, how
ever, credit the president of the United
States with more power than he really
possesses. They believe the president
Is a 'king In a frock coat'. But they
are in no way Interested In American
politics."
Inability to secure business commu
nications because of the English cen
sorship of malls necessitated his re
turn to this country at this time, Mr.
Glogauer said.
No Msll for Months.
'1 have been unable to obtain any
business TTS3«i for Hicnths/' hs ff&id. "I
would receive the Art Institute bulletin
and catalogue, but never any business
mall. .My bank here (the Union Trust
Company) has tried for months to get
Into communication with me, but could
not do so—and I am an American clt
izen.
"Didn't see with my own eyes how
they are doing? They stopped the
Frederick V. at Kirkwall, searched ev
erything. and took off all mall, even
Ambassador Gerard's personal re
ports."
