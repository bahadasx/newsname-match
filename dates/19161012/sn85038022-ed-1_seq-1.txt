JYeurs of interest to Svertone
Nowadajn we read a great deal in the papen about the high eoat t' woolen, the scarcity of
elye-sl nil's, ami the rise in Iii'mm- which is all true. ntl must necessarily affect the price of
clothes.
But we were one of the few houses in the Ohio Valley who were fortunate enough to have
made the bulk of our fall purchase during the early part of 1916, which enables us to sell you
goods at the same old price as you paid last year. Many houses are obliged to raise their
prices, but we are not, and are going to give you the benefit of our early purchase.
All of our new Suils. Overcoats, Shoes. Mitts and Furnishings are now in all dependable,
merchandise, op to onr high standard ol' quality aad the prices are no higher than last year.

Suits That Look Double Their Price
A little discovery that all the essential "smartness" of tailoring depends upon
the line brings suits of rare attractiveness at very moderate prices. It is astonish
ing to find suits so smart as these in this low range of price. It is only because
domestic talent copies so well the essentials of imported models that it can be done.
