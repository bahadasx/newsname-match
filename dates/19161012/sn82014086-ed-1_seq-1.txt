NO NEWS RECEIVED OF,
GERMAN SUBMARINE U-53.
British Vessels Are Being Detained
Ports as Matter of Precaution.
New York, Oct. 11. Although there
was no news today to indicate that
the German submarine U-53 was still
lurking in the Atlantic sea lanes, and
while some shipping interests believed
she has headed for Helgoland, there
was evidence that the British admiral
ty will proceed withecaution in allow
ing British ships to depart from At
lantic coast ports. Two British ves
sels due to sail today did not leave,
and It was reported that others which
have cleared, both French and British,
will riot sail at present.
Shipping circles heard today that
Admiral Montague Browning, in com
mand of the British fleet at Halifax,
had issued orders detaining the British
merchant vessels now in American
ports until such time as it was deem
ed safe for them to depart. Verifica
tion of this report could not be ob
tained at the British consulate, which
issues the final sailing orders, but it
was admitted that such orders for the
Cunard freighters Pannonia and St.
George, due to sail today, had been
withheld.
A dozen other British ships, includ
ing the big White Star passenger liner
Adriatic, got their clearance papers
today, but it was said that with the
exception of the Adriatic the dates of
their departure would depend upon the
developments in the efforts which, it
Is taken for granted, the British ad
miralty is making to rid American
waters of the submarine danger.
The Adriatic, White Star line of
fices said, would sail at noon tomor
row, and prospective passengers had
been so notified.
USE OF TRACTION SYSTEMS
FOR MILITARY PURPOSES.
Co-ordination is Advocated by Colonel
Chauncey Baker.
Atlantic City, N. J., Oct. 11. Co
ordination of the traction systems of
the country with the military districts
so that they shall be immediately
available for military purposes in the
event of war was advocated by Col
onel Chauncey Baker of the quarter
master's department, U. S. A., speak
ing in place of Major General Wood
before the American Electric Railway
association here yesterday.
"The preparedness program should
not only include provisions for the
handling of troops, but for munitions
told general equipment as well," he de
clared. "The electric systems should
play an important part in the program
Df military transportation, acting JVi
reeaers ior me steam systems or for
quick runs between military bases."
Cokmel Baker said that nobody
could say with any positiveness that
we would not become involved In the
European war.

WOMEN'S CAMPAIGN TRAIN
PROVING A GREAT SUCCESS.
Have Frustrated Plans of Democratic
National Committee.
New York, Oct. 11. "The women's
campaign special train is proving a
great success." said Miss Frances A.
Kellor at the Hughes alliance head
quarters today. Miss Kellor, who is
chairman of the women's committee of
the national Hughes alliance, has had
change of the entire work of financing
and equipping the train and of or
ganizing both the speakers that go
with the train and the state and local
committees that receive it. Miss Kel
lor was obliged to leave the train at
Minneapolis Saturday night for a
business trip to New York, but will
rejoin it at once.
"The thing that pleases us most is
the activity of the democratic nation
al committee," Miss Kellor said. "They
have organized from the Atlantic to
the Pacific to defeat the train- The
honor of drawing the full batteries of
the opposition has remained for the
women. The stories sent out about
the wealth of luxury represented by
the train were enough to make, every
bandit left in the west hurry down to
the railroad track to s'op us.
"Those stories are beginning to do
us good now. In several places where
people have come to meet the train,
expecting to find all sorts of curiosi
ties in it, they have been all the more
impressed by the serious, earnest, ram
peten: women that they really did find
there."

CYCLONE SWEPT OVER
ISLAND OF ST. THOMAS
No Known Loss of Life, But Many Per
sons Were .Injured.
St. Thomas, D. W. I., Oct. 11. A cy
clone swept over St. Thomas Monday
night and yesterday morning, with dis
astrous results. Almost every build
ing in the citywas damaged and some
were destroyed. There were many per
sons injured and it is probably some
form of public relief will be neces
sary. The damage thus far reported runs
Into the hundreds of thousands of dol
lars. So far as is known there was
r.o lossi- of life.
The storm began Monday night and
on Tuesday morning, after an interval
of calm, re-commenced with increased
force. For four hours it continued to
work havoc. Trees were uprooted and
much damage was done to shipping,
the Hamburg-American Line steam
ships Calabria and Wasgenwald and
the Danish dredge St. Hildas were
blown ashore. The Calabria probably
Is a total loss. The Danish motor
steamship Anholt and the Danish
barkentine Thor were wrecked and
the entire local fleet of small craft, as
well as the recently completed harbor j
works, suffered heavy damages. The j
electrical coal conveyors on the har
bor front were destroyed.
FIVE SHIP'S BOATS
FOUND ABANDONED
Believed to be Those of the Torpe
died Steamship Kir.gstonian.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 11. The find
ing of five abandoned ship's boats by
the Spanish steamer Antonio LopeZj
reported in a radio message relayed to
the naval station here today by the
Nantucket Shoals lightship, was con
sidered by officials as- the first' possi
ble trace of the crew of the steam
ship Kingstonian, reported torpedoed
by a German submarine on Sunday.
Search for the crew had been sus
pended by the naval authorities, who
doubted whether the submarine's vic
tims included any vessel other than
those whose crews had been brought
to land. By some, the message was
held to be far from conclusive evi
dence that a six vessel was sunk, the
suggestion being made that the boats

the message said. The rest of the ra

intelligible by errors in transmission.
As received, it read: "They had on
board HIS apparel only. It. is im
possible to read HIS names. One of
them had painted word 'Liverpool.'

BERLIN PAPERS COMMENT
ON LATE SHIPPING RAID
Morgen Post Says It is in Accordance
. With "Humane" Methods Promised
Berlin, Oct. 11, Noon, vit London,
9.09 p. m. The newspapers conlinue
to show great interest in tha German
submarine activoties off the American
coast. The news of the submarine raid
is prominently .printed, but there is a
singular indisposition to comment on
it. The possibility that it will lead
to political complications with the
Washington government is generally
dismissed, when it is dismussed at
all.
The Morgen Post declares that the
submarines are acting in accordance
with the "humane" methods 'which
Germany promised President Wilson
would be carried out. The Cologne
Gazette says the appearance of sub
marines in the Atlantic merely de
notes a lengthening of their dadius of
action, rendering it possible "to strike
the enemy hard and effectively, but in
such form as not to expose us to
hampering complaints from any quar
ter which might believe itself enti
tled to complain."
AMERICAN NAVY IS
TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION
Against Use of Coast as Base of Sup
plies for Foreign Submarines.
Newport, R. I.. Oct. 11. The Amer
ican navy is taking every precaution
against the use of the American coast
as a base of supplies for foreign sub
marines. All day today there was a
great activity among the destroyer flo
tilla at the naval base here and when
the destroyers McCall. Porter and
Cummings went out on a mysterious
mission this afternoon. Rear Admiral
Knight, in command of this district,
was asked if the boats were search
ing for a submarine base or looking
up some foreign submarine tender.
"I cannot answer that," the admiral
stated, "but we are leaving no report
of submarine bases or tenders pass by
without an investigation."
Shore leave among the men of the
fleet has been greatly curtailed and
each ship in active commission has
virtually a full complement always on
hand.
IN
DEFENSE OF NEW
SUBMARINE WARFARE
Overseas News Agency Says It is in
Accord With International Law.
Berlin, Oct. 11. (By Wireless to
Sayville.) ("Concerning recent develop
ments In submarine warfare, it is stat
ed by a competent authority," says the
Overseas News Agency, "that subma
rine activity along the lines of so
called cruiser war is in accord with in
ternational law and admitted by all le
gal authorities and responsible states
men. Further, the practice of Ger
man submarines in no way violates the
promises and interpretations given by
German authorities and accepted by
other nations.
"German submarines act only after
giving due warning and after allowing
ample time for the crew and passeng
ers to leave the ship In boats. It is
pointed out that even the Reuter tele
grams are unable to give any detail
Indicating illegal act on the part of
submarines."
Gummings Wants
Series of Debates
AT HARTFORD, NEW HAVEN.
WATERBURY, BRIDGEPORT
CHALLENGE IS REPEATED
Would Debate With Senator MLean
the Issues of the Campaign at Four
Public Meeting Asks for a Definite
Reply.
New Haven, Conn., Oct. 11. Before
(Considering Senator George P. Mc
Lean's proposition to debato the issues
of the campaign with Homer S. Cum
mings at Stamford on Oct. 25, Chair
man David E. Fitzgerald of the demo
cratic state central committee wants
to know whether Air. McLean accepts
or rejects the original challenge to de.
bate at Hartford, New Haven, Water
bury and Bridgeport.
In a letter today to J. Henry Rora
back, chairman of the republican state
central committee, Mr. Fitzgerald
says: '
Fitzgerald's Letter.
"In further reply to your letter of
Oct. 9th, in which you suggest that
Senator McLean Is willing to partici
pate in a. debate with Mr. Cummijigs
at Stamford on Oct 25th, I wish to
say that you have apparently over
looked the purpose and intent of my
letter to you on Oct. 6th, in which I
suggested that Senator McLean and
Mr. Cummings debate the issues of the
campaign at a series of four public
meetings to be held at Hartford. New
Haven, Waterbury and Bridge-port. I
trust that Senator McLean does not
wish to be understood as declining to
meet Mr. Cummings in public debate
in the four loading cities in the state,
where large assemblages may conven
iently gather and where the newspaper
facilities are the most complete.
"Before, therefore, considering your
counter-proposition, kindly let me
know definitely whether Senator Mc
Lean accepts er rejects tha offer as I
made it and if he rejects the offer,
what'reason. lifi has for so doing.
"If debates of this character were
not beneath the dignity of Lincoln, I
trust that Senator McLean will look
upon the idea with favor."
Mr. Fitzgerald requests a prompt
reply and adds this postscript: "Fot
fear you have mislaid my letter con
taining the challenge, I herewith en
close a copy of it."
RORABACK SURPRISED
AT TONE OF LETTER.
Felt Certain That Date at Stamford
"WdtiWBe Acceptable! "
Hartford, Conn., Oct- 11. Chairman
J. Henry Roraback of the republican
state central committee said tonight
that he had not yet received the letter
from David E. Fitzgerald concerning
the pro-posed debate between Senator
McLean and Homer S. Cummings. Mr.
Fitzgerald's letter was- then read to
him and Mr. Koraback expressed sur
prise at its tone.
He said that the reply to Mr. Fitz
gerald's previous letter accepted the
challenge for the debate and suggest
ed as a time for the meeting the first
opportunity Senator McLean's engage
ments allowed. A previous speaking
engagement of Senator McLean has
been set for New Haven, when ex
President Taft is also to appear. It
would be impossible to have the de
bate then, Mr. Roraback said. The
next speaking date which Senator Mc
Lean has is in Stamford on Oct. 25,
which time and place were suggested
by Mr. Roraback-
The state chairman said he had
been certain that the date at Stam
ford would be acceptable to both Mr.
Cummings and Mr. Fitzeerald. Wo
declined to comment further until he
had received Mr. Fitzgerald's letter.

DEMANDS ENTIRE FLEET
Greece is Given Until 1 P. P. Wednes
' day to Surrender Her Navy Con
trol of Piraeus- Larissa Railway Also
Demanded.

miral Fournet's demands Till be com
plied with and that the fleet wi;i be
handtd over before the prescribed
time.
A Precautionary Measure.
"The demands were made as a pre
cautionary measure to ensure the safe
ty of the allies' fleet,"
It is explained that the despatch of
jn-tl'lP'-y and ammunition to the inte
rior, the movements of Greek ships and
:,.e c'jViinued activity of the reservist

turbance of order at points where the

ASSISTANCE TO GREECE
In Case She Enters the War No New
Concessions Have Been Made.
Athens, Monday, Oct. 9, via Lon
don, Oct. Al, 10.20 p. m. The entente
y aJliesB.havwagaiw-fifiM5d to assist
Greece In case she enters the war. but
have been made. It is learned that
entente diplomatic circles of Athens
.yesterday adviced the French and the
British chancelleries, which are
charged by the other allied govern
ments with the negotiations with
Greece, to reply to King Constantine's
informal proposals to depart from neu
trality, made to the Greek ministers in
London and Paris on September 18 in
the following sense:
"While the form in which the pro
posals were made is unacceptable and
the question of Bulgarian occupation of
Greek soil is considered purely a Greek
matter in which the entente is not con
cerned, nevertheless should Greece vol
untarily abandon neutrality, declare
war on Bulgaria and decree a gener
al mobilization, the entente will be dis
posed to furnish every assistance in
the campaign and to give other mate
rial proofs of benevolent interest in the
welfare of Greece."
It is understood, however, that these
diplomatic assurances are not to in
terfere in any way with the instruc
tions already given the admiral of the
allied fleets to assure by all necessary
measures the safety of the allied
armies In the east.

PARIS NEWSPAPERS DISCUSS
GERMAN UNDERSEA CRUISERS
Temps "Doubts if America Will Allow
Her Coast to Be Blockaded.
Paris, Oct. 11. 5.15 p. m. The news
papers continue to discuss animatedly
the situation created by the operations
of German undersea craft in American
waters. All of them evince lively in
terest in what the Washington govern
ment is likely to do in the matter. The
Temps today concludes a leading arti
cle on the subject as follows:
"It is doubtful if American export
ers are disposed to allow the organ
ization of a blockade of their coast and
ization of a blockade of their coast
that the country will allow the Ger
mans to trifle with American neutral
ity. As to the Germans, one would
have a wrong idea of them t othink
that they will confine themselves to
these first exploits, even if there is an
interval before the renewal of them."
