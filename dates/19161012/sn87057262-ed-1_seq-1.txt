ON BOARD PRESIDENT WIS
LON'S TRAIN, COLUMBUS. Ohio,
Oct, 12.—President Wilson passed
through, here early today enroute to
Indianapolis, where a busy program
awaits him. He js expected to make
three addresses, review a parade, at
tend a luncheon and participate In a
good roads celebration at the Hoosier
capital before night. He will greet
and speak to politicians, business
men and farmers assembled in Indian
apolis during the day and the demo
crats are looking for some good cam
paign material in the president's vis
It.
Before leaving the summer white
house at Long Branch, N. J., the presi
dent disposed of all immediate ques
tions arising out of the spectacular
appearance and activity of the Ger
man submarine 53 off the eastern
coast. -Alt is learned careful inquiry
will be made toy this government
through regular dlplpmaticchannels
to ascerttain whether Germany in
tends to continue on this side of the
Atlantic such raids as were inaugurat
ed by the 53 just outside American
ports. Such continued action would
be regarded as intolerable by this
government, it may oe stated on good
authority. Reports that more than
one submarine may be operating
along the coast aroused deep interest
in the executive party, hut nothing
official has been received by the pres
ident.
The president also appointed the
advisory commission to be associated
with the council of national defense
for working out plans of rapid mob
ilization of the country's resources.
The commission includes Daniel Wil
lard, Baltimore Samuel Gomuers,

[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent:]
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 12.—The
Hoosier capital today gave President
Wilson a rip roaring welcome when
he arrived at 11.35 o'clock to spend
the day.
There was an absence of brass
bands and red1 fire such as heralded
the visit of Charles E. Hughes some
nights ago but in the demonstrations
accorded the president, the line hand
of the democratic "home guard" was
observed to have done a finished
piece of work. They did not intend
to let their republican adversaries
beat them to it on the crowds and
noise and they were successful.
A throng was at the station when
the president's train pulled in and
thousands of people lined the streets
to the Claypool hotel where the presi
dent went for a brief rest and lun
cheon with Governor and Mrs. Rals
ton before the day's activities began.
At one this afternoon the president
was tov lead a "prosperity parade'* of
automolbiles through the business sec
tion of the city, reviewing the parade
after reaching his stand. The line of
travel was packed with people carry
ing Wilson banners and all forms of
noise producing instruments to give
the executive a royal reception.
The first address of the day is
scheduled in the fair grounds at 2:30
this afternoon—a good roads speech.

THE TIMELY INTERVIEW
Richard Holt Criticized Recent Ut
terance in Which, Ktoockout
Expression Was
Used,
[By Ed L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, Oct. 12.—Lloyd George's
crushing rejoiner to Richard Holt,
one of his critics in commons yester
day, received equal attention from
the newspapers today^ with Premier
Asquith's statement that there must
be no "precarious and dishonoring
compromise, masquerading under the
name of peace."
Holt criticized the war secretary's
recent statement on peace to the
United Press. He complained that
Lloyd George used sporting terms
like the now famous "knockout"' ex
pression that his statements were
uncompromising and that the war
minister was not the proper person
to express the government's views on
foreign policies.
Turning directly toward Holt,
Lloyd George said:.
"What you really object to is not
the manner, btit the pith and purport
of this interview."
Lloyd George added that he was
simply elaborating what the British
and French prime ministers h"ad said
and what the cabinet and military ad
visers believed. He spoke with im
pressive emphasis when he said he
wished he were at librty to "tell the
honorable member how timely the In
terview was on its appearance."
The London papers particularly
emphasize Lloyd-George's declara
tion that the interview was timely
and essential and not merely a per
sonal expression, but the opinion of
the cabinet and war committee and
also of England's allies.
"Between these words," said the
Daily Telegraph, referring to the ref
erence to the timeliness of the inter
view, "even the dullest imagination
can read. Plainly the interview was
expressly timed to kill an intended at
tempt at intervention and it suc
ceeded—there's no need to say
where.
The general impression^ was^ today
that in making this quick retort to
his critics, Lloyd George effectively
scotched a hostile clique, which
though small, is somewhat mischiev
ous. At the same time he-thoroughly
justified the propriety of cabinet

OO-PEIN'HIAGEN, Oct. 12—King Ot
to, of Bavaria, EJurope's "mad king,"
died suddenly at the castle of Fuer
stenried, where he has been confined,
insane, for several years.
The "mad king" of Bavaria, about
seventy years old at the time of his
death, startled Europe by his eccen
tricities Before he was declared in
capable of ruling on November 5,
1913. and was succeeded by his cous
in, King Cudwig III.
He had nominally succeeded his
brother, King Ludwig II, in 1886 when
Ludwig committed suicide by throw
ing himself into a lake during a fit
of insanity. His uncle, the regent
Luitpold, was however the real .ruler
of Bavaria.
During the Franco-Prussian war,
Otto first showed symptoms of insan
ity when he called out a squad of
cayalry to charge straight at a stone
wall. The stone wall, he said, was a
body of French infantry. Later he
was summoned by the kaiser to head
quarters and it was reported papers
were found in his possession Offering
to make peace with (France. He was
then put under medical escort.
Several years ago the "mad king"
was imprisoned in the Fuerstenried
castle. Though in the midst of rich
furnishings, he is reported to have
lived like a savage, refusing to have
his hair or nails, cut and avoiding wat
er and soap. For day he would re
fuse food, imagining it to be poison
ed. His attendants finally persuad
ed him to eat by pretending to hide
food about the palace. The "mad
king" then "discovered" the food and
believing it had been hidden by the
servants to satisfy their own appe
tites, ate it with the greatest relish.
He was passionately fond of grand
opera, summoned well known singers
to his castle prison and often Spent
days listening to operas.
On April 27 of each year, King
Otto was examined by a government
commission, charged with the duty of
reporting on his sanity. A few years
ago he became seriously iU from a
carbuncle on his neok and waB be
lieved to be dying.

WITH THE3 FRENCH ARMIES
SOUTH OF THE SOMME, Oct. 12.—
Drawing their encircling noose in
from the west, north and southwest,
the Frencn have advanced their lines
at several points to within a few
hundred yards of the Important town
of Chaulnes.
The town was already seriously
menaced by the French advance on
Tuesday, wnen German positions
were taken on a three mile front.
The French are pocketing it in the
same manner in which the allies
drove the Germans out of Combles.
[Chaulnes, tc a certain extent,
holds the same important relation to
the German l:.ne south of the Somme
as did Combles north of the river.
It is-a point of support, the junction
of several important highways and
its capture will enable the French to
dominate the surrounding country for
several miles.]
Aerial torpedoes and secretly dug
trenches gave wonderful aid to the
French in their movement to encircle
Chaulnes.
On Monday I visited the first line
trenches near Denicourt three miles
northeast of Chaulnes to watch prep
arations for the great attack launch
ed on Tuesday.
The French were secretly digging
a new trench, running parallel to the
German positions. It was from this
trench that French infantry was de
stined to mane the attack, thus re
ducing the width of the fire zone it
was necessary for the soldiers to
cross before reaching the German
trenches.
While the usual terrific artillery
preparation wa3 going on, the Fr vnch
were systematically destroying the
German wire entanglements with
their new perial torpedoes. These
they launched from little trench mor
tars.

the shells, the passage of these tor-

Republican Candidate Hughes
Does Not Intend to Walk
into a Trap Which
Might Commit
Him.
HAS NO AGREEMENTS
Allegation That He Represents the
German-American Vote, Is
to be Ignored
Entirely.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
PIKES
Vims, Ky., Oct. 12.—Repub­
lican Candidate Hughes is determined
not to make any answer to the charge
that he represents the German-Ameri
can vote. He regards himself as po
tentially a president.
He holds it his duty neither by word
or deed to walk into any trap which
shall seem to commit him, a man who
may be chosen in November to dic
tate America's position toward the
world, to any, specific course of ac
tion with regard to European policies.
The United Press presents this ex
planation of the candidate's attitude
by permission today.
When Hughes discusses and con
demns the British blacklist, It is fur
their explained it is not with the idea
of an animus against Great Britain.
When he hits at the submarine war
tore and the Wilson administration
handling of that Issue, be does not
speak with a mind biagpd against
Germany. He speaks alTone who re
gards America's opportunity, as the
greatest of neutral nations, the most
momentous to America herself and to
the other nations of the world in es
tablishing firmly the principles of neu
trality.
To those with whom he talkeg on
the subject. Governor Hughes has
added to this statement of position,
the following:
"America must leave no stone un
turned to enforce against stay natioi
her rights as a world power. By sfc
doing, the United States not only
maintains her own dignity' as a na
tion, but she establishes more firmly
the principles of justice contained in
international law. International law,
the goveror holds, is not a fixed code.
It is a collection of principles to which
nations subscribe. Those principles
•become fixed only when some great
nation establishes their justice and
fairness by demand, unflinchingly
maintained for their fullest observ
ance. If the United States can ac-
compil8h
•X

,bw
holdi„e an na.
of* law 'by holding all na
tions strictly accountable to the spirit
of the now only nebulous principles
of international law, America will
have her opportunity to become fore
most among world powers."
The republican candidate, it is said,
for him, feels very strongly the deli
cacy of his position as a presidential
oandidate in this time when interna
tional law is In the making. He is
extremely resentful of any jockeying
by either his friends or his political
foes, which atempts to align him with
either the allies or the entente pow
ers. He does not desire in any ut
terance to mention the name of a
single one of the warring ppwers, lest
some incorrect deduction be made
from that mention. But in every
speech from now on he expects to re
iterate in emphatic language his dis
avowal that he has any understanding
or agreement or intrigues with any
body.
Here at PIkesville, Ky., early today
the governor made this disavowal,
although the major part of his speech
was devoted to a discussion of labor
problems and prosperity.
Today the nominee was almost in
the fued belt of Kentucky. He was
scheduled for si? speeches during the
day, winding up with a mass meeting
