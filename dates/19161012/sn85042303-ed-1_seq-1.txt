The crew of engineers is employed

Railway company. The Atchison owm.

Valley to Lindsay.
What It Means.
What this railroad activity means Is1
for each man to (wire out for himself. '
The Santa Ke owns a line branching
from Pauls Valley by way of Shawnee
and connects up with the lino out of
Kansas City near the Kansas and
Oklahoma line. That Hue of roa 1
gives tho company douhlo tracks
through the northern part of the state.
The company might, want to do the
same thing in the southern portion of
the state. It might want a differem
line south out of Pauls Valley to evade
the Washita canyon in times of high
water.
Santa Fe Wildcatting.
The Santa Ko I also drilling a wild
cat well south of Lindsay on acreage
secured from John L. Ahernathy oi'
Purc.ll. The company hopes, of
course, to be able to develop an oil
field of its own in the Reneral direo
tion of north from llealdton and Fox.
Its line of survey will run near the
prospective new field. It looks prob
able now that In the course of a few
years there will be a line of derricks
running from Red river to Washita
river near Lindsay. It is predicted
that the next field developed will he
north or northwest of Fox anil a line
of road coming down through there
would be able to touch all these fields,
whether It could serve them or not.
Big Tonnage required.

ARDMORE'S OPPORTUNITY
A railroad must be built from
Ardmore to the Fox Held. There
no project which can au-
lil lo tniri cuy Willi greater
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
force, nor is there a greater
drawback possible to the city
than to see this field and its
business stretched in another
direction.
Now is the time for action.
The whole country knows what
Ardmore got from the Healdton
field. They know that the
Rinpllng railroad paid for itself
in less than one year. They
low inis neia pourea minions
into Ardmore.
Can anyone be blamed If they
covet this new field and go
after II? The citizens of Ard
more must Immediately go
after this railroad. They must,
if necessary, finance It them
selves. If not, the railroad map of
the state will soon be changed
and another line from the north
U will penetrate tiTTitory which
a is ours if we will secure it.
The Importance of this to
Ardmore is emphasized by the
fact that Santa Fe surveyors
are already at woric north of
the Fox field and that an an
nouncement has been made
that a railroad would be built
from the south in the same
territory.
It is not a matter of stop
Ding other projects. Let them
build If they will, but Ardmore a aid has occupied it. The place has

Local Man Will Build
Tint there comes from another
source the positive statement from
a local oil man who has wealth suf
ficient to build a lino of road from
Ardmore to Fox that he will have a
line built from Ardmore before any
one else Is started, lie also states
that he will not ask for nor accept
one penny of bonus money from Ard-
more, that he will not ask for nor
accept one milo of free right or way
from any source and that the line of
road will bo constructed.
As wo seo the situation, the Ard
more Chamber of Commerce has pre
sented to It an excellent opportunity
to do a big service for this city. The
question of the Santa Fe's plans
should be taken up directly either with
President Ripley or with the offices
of the company in Oklahoma City.
Ardmore. Pauls Valley. Puncan and
other towns along the Santa Fe and
Rock Island do not want a line of road
built running north and south through
the strip of country between the San
ta Fe and the Rock Island. That
a(area of country Is entitled to railway
facilities, but those facilities should
reach toward this city. The people
of the western portion of the county
eomo here as their court town, they
come hero for their trading, they
como here for the sale of their pro
ducts. They would many times rather
have direct connection with Ardmore.
A line south would not be used by
them. Those people would rather co
operate with a road built into this city
than with a road running north and
street railway In Ardmore to build a
south.
Every feature of railroading favors
this city. Ardmore must reach out
and add this proposed new line. A
meeting to determine the proper steps
to be taken should be held at once.
Hall Purchases Home.
C. P. Hall has purchased the Miles
H. Williams home located at the cor-
n'ner of Tenth and G street, northwest,
tract closer in.

awarded the first, Miss Clotee Godfrey
second, and Mrs. Maud Tanner third.
