Menominee Indians Worse
Than Slaves.
It is doubtful whether there are
any Indians in this country whose
treatment has been as bad as that
of the Menominee Indiana at the
hands of government officials.
These Indians have a reservation
in "Wisconsin, and it was and still
is rich with pine forests, from
which the Indians, had they been
allowed to carry on their timber
operations unmolested, would now
je the wealthiest Indians in the
country. But while they were
inaking good progress in their
I logging operations and accumula
ting a large tribal fund, the gov
ernment stepped in and established
a saw-mill upon the reservation,
and took exclusive charge of its
operation without regard to the
wishes of the Indians, and coin
meuced to create many positions,
many of which were sinecures,
and to pay out and expend "with a
lavish hand the Menominee tribal
fund until it has become greatly
diminished.
Added to the misfortunes of the
Menominee Indians, they have a
superintendent whom they charge
with being a tyrant, and as stated
by President Wilson regarding the
leaders of a certain political party
S'm a speech recently, "when they
Vjr intervene in their affairs, are re
garded as guilty of an impertin
I ence." Not only are the Menom
inees regarded by their superin
teodent as being guilty of an im
pertinence but he immediately
marks them, and upon the slight
est provocation has his Indian po
lice throw them into the agency
jail without the formality of a
hearing. In fact the superintend
ent is the judge, jury and proe
cuting attorney, or "high poh
bah"of the reservation.
For acting in the capacity of a
tyrant the superintendent over the
Menominee Indians receives a sal
ary from the tribal funds of the
Indians of $3,500 per year, a sum
for which, it is charged, he does
Jp^not give value received.
The Menominee Indians are
practically helpless to protect
themselves, principally because a
large majority of them lack the
necessary education to know how
to proceed to try and ha\e the
conditions among them corrected.
But they have one great advant
age over a large majority of the
Indian tribes of this country, one
of their mixed-bloods is a United
States senator with strong senti
ments favorable to Indians.
One of the complaints of the
Menominee Indians is that a large
quantity of Menominee Indian
lumber is allowed to go to waste
on account of the dilatory meth
ods used in disposing of it that
those who have charge of its dn
posal first have to obtain authority
from Washington to do so, and
that this delay often causes an
'f order for lumber to be counter
manded by a proposed purchaser.
It is also claimed that this would
not occur if a competent superin-
ts) & l&^CA^"-"/i" *'j
tendent had charge of all the Me
nominee lumbering operations.
It has been learned upon good
authority that Supt. O'Neil, who
it cannot be,denied is a competent
judge, recently represented to the
Secretary of the Interior tha^t the
superintendent of the Menominee
reservation is incompetent to fill
the position he holds, or to con
duct a proper supervision over the
lumbering operations of the In
dians over which he is in charge.
It is also charged that notwith
standing the proof that has been
furnished the authorities at Wash
ington, the New York influences
of the superintendent are too
strong, and this prevents his re
moval that in addition to the New
York influences, a member of the
Board of Indian Commissioners,
who is a lumberman and resides at
Chicago, upholds the Menominee
superintendent.
It is also stated that while he
was at the Menominee reservation,
Supt. Hinton, then a special agent
of the Indian office, did not besi
tate to criticise the manner in
which the affairs of the Menomin
ees were being conducted, and that
Special Indian Agent Pears callpd
him to task 'about this.
In order"to have conditions cor
rected upon the Menominee reser
vation, the Menominee Indians
should appeal to their kinsman,
Senator Husting, of Wisconsin, to
bring the matter directly to the
attention of President Wilson, for
the experience of some of the
members of this reservation who
made personal appeals to the presi
dent to correct, certain *-evils
brought quick results.
It is suggested that our inform
ants should advise the Menominee
Indians to cause the arrest of their
superintendent upon a false im
prisonment charge every time he
causes the arrest of an Indian
without due process of law, and
this would no doubt cause him to
be a little more careful, and pre
vent him from causing indiscrim
inate arrests without submitting
his charge, if any, before a proper
magistrate.
The Menominee outrages should
receive the attention of the Society
of American Indians if its object
is really for the purpose of pro
tecting Indians from any acts of
injustice. The society should at
least investigate the conditions
upon the Menominee reservation
with the view to bringing the mat
ter to the attention of Congress at
its next session if not to the presi
dent.

The Society Of American
Indians.
At the meeting of the Society
of American Indians at Cedar
Rapids, la the following officers
were elected for the ensuing year:
A. C. Parker, of Albany, N. Y.,
president vice-president, John
Oskison, New York City secre
tary, Mrs. Gertrude Bonnin, Zit
kalasa, Ft. Duschene, Utah treas
urer, Mrs. Marie L. Baldwin,
Washington, D. vice presidents
of education, Hon. Gabe E. Park
er and Hon. Chas. 1). Carter, both
of Oklahoma vice president on
membership, Margaret Fraser of
Santee, Neb. chairman of advisory
board, Rev. Phillip Gordon, Wash
ington, D. honorary vice-presi
dent, Rev. Sherman Coolidge,
Faribault, Minn.
The meeting adopted a new
platform for the society which is
as follows:
"Platform of the sixth annual
conference of the Society of Ameri
can Indians, adopted at Cedar
Rapids, la., Sept. 29, 1916
The Society of American In
dians assembled in sixth annual
conference in the city of Cedar
Rapids, la., more conscious than
ever of the complex situation in
which a kindly and benevolent
government h:is placed the appeal
ing to the people, the congress and
the executive officers of the^ nation
for such si mpathetic couusel and
assistance as muy be necessary in
working out a plan for a- legJ
educational and administrative
policy which, when adopted, shall
contemplate the speedy and just
settlement of all causes of Indian
discontent, by placing them on an
equal footing with other Ameri
cans, do adopt the following plat
form:
1. We believe that the time has
come when we ought to call upon
the country and upon congress to
look to the closing of the Indian
bureau as soon as trust funds,
treaty rights and oth*r just obli
gations can be individualized, paid
or fulfilled. It should be seen
that the Indian bureau was never
intended as a permanent part of
the inten'or department, but mere=
ly a temporary function. With the
progress and education of Indians
they should be invested with the
full privileges of citizens, without
burdensome restrictions. As its
jurisdiction is removed the books
of the bureau should be closed un
til there is a final elimination. As
citizens and taxpayers, struggling
side by side with other Americans
we are willing to trust our liberties
and fortunes to the several com
munities of which we form a part.
2. It is believed that the prepara
tion and introduction in Indian
schools of the new vocational
courses of study, marks an epoch
in Indian education. Furthermore
we cannot urge too strongly upon
the congress that provision should
bemude, and the Indian pupils en
couraged, to make use of the fed
eral schools merely as the stepping
stones to attendance in white
school*, where contact with other
American youth makes for patriot
ic, competent citizenship and all
Indian pupils over (21) twenty-one
years of age having completed a
prescribed course of study should
be deemed fully competent, given
control of their own property and
thrown upon their own resources.
3. We commend the efforts of
the officials of the bureau for the
suppression of the liquor traffic
among Indians, and we urge upon
our own people the adoption of
habits of total abstinence, which
we are convinced are conducive to
happiness and prosperity. We urge

unequivocally upon the congress
the passage of the Gandy bill to
prohibit the commerce in and use
of peyote among our people, be
cause of its known baneful effects
upon the users in mind and mor
als.
4. We commend all efforts to
improve sanitary and health con
ditions on reservations, and to
save the lives of the Indian babies
which efforts have already result
ed in greatly reducing the death
rate. We trust that the health
campaign will continue unabated
until the baneful effects of reser
vation life and ignorance shall
have been wiped out for both in
fants and adults.
jjWe again call upon our own
people to the exercise of all manly
and womanly virtues, fighting with
courage the battles of life,
thoroughly imoued with the spirit
of progress so essential to the ul
timate salvation of our race.

of the white members of the so
ciety, met Friday evening and

5. We re-affirm the principles
so ardently and justly urged by
former conferences of the society.
We reiterate our pleas made in our
Denver and Lawrence platform?,
calling for a definition of the legal
status of the Indian, for the in
dividualization of trust funds and
the early adjudication of all tribal
claims. We renew our appeal as
made in our memorial to the presi
dent of the United States Dec.

Indian society by these co opera
ting white members."
According to the report of THE
TOMAHAWK'S correspondent the
attendance at the meeting was
very light, there being only fifteen
or twenty Indians present.
There is no doubt that the fail
ure of the society to obtain at least
one representative from each In
dian reservation is because the
ofltbers of the society have invari
ably selected places too far away
from Indian reservations to have
any representation from Indian
reservations at its meetings.
WILSOH-CSL
SERVICE-HUGHES.
Under the above caption the
Minneapolis Tribune contains a
leng article regarding the relative
positions of President Wilson and
candidate Hughes toward the civil
set vice system, and it states that
Hughes is a very much
strouger advocate of the system
than President Wilson.
It also says in regard to Nelson
S. Spencer, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee of the civil ser
vice reform association, that "In
favor of Mr. Hughes, this record
is invoked by Mr. Spencer: 'When
he was governor of New York not
a single bill which imparled the
civil service law or the efficiency
of the service became a law- with
his consent."

'For the first time in New York
a scheme of high class competitive

'His veto messages in various
instances disclose his devotion to
the civil service principle.'
The report of the Civil Service
Reform association in 1908 com
mended him for his attitude, say
ing: 'Such unqualified indorse
ment of the system, coming from
the chief executive of a state, hai
given added impetus to the move
ment for its exteution."
It is Mr. Hughes' position which
is so strongly in favor of civil ser
vice law which will cause him to
lose many votes, a great many
more than ho will gain by it.
Everyone who has been thrown
intimately into contact with civil

An experience of more than
eighteen years in the government
