ISECOND YEARS
I WIN PUSH BALL
GAMEATB.Y.C.
Judging from the enthusiasm
manifesting Itself over the athletic
activities at the B. Y. C. ono might
bo justified In expecting nn active
and successful year of sport. Tho
first and second year classes began
It. The first years on tho day fol
lowing the announcement of the
Rush, appeared in chapel and In
classes wearing blue and white; and
while thus decked out kicked up all
the fuss necessary to a well discip
lined school. Tho second years, of
course, resented theso antics with
many a friendly tussel before tho
real rush commenced. .It was a
rather unique rush. Tho victor was
tho class which carrlod moro of Its
opponents across its goal. Tho sec
ond year boys wcro larger by a
year's growth and a year moro sys
tematic In the planning of tho do
talls keeping light weights In tho
back ground under cover and rush
ing the heavy weights. This advan
tage made tho older class victors by
quite a large score.
Before tho rush was even com
menced, tho fourth year class (wise
ly or otherwise) challenged tho vln
tors for a tug of war across tho ca
nal. The cold dip will bo taken In
. a few days, probably Friday after
noon. Tho autumn basketball series be
gan last evening. Partly at least, tho
size of tho crowd and tho loudness
of the cheering was duo to the vig
orous speeches in chapel of the rep
resentatives of tho two classes.
Eunlco Palmer played two piano
selections In dovotlonal on Tuesday.
President Johnson of tho Portnuff
stake, nnd Joseph E. Cardon of Lo
gan, were tho speakers In devotion
al on Wednesday.
In tho collego class election he'd
somo days ago tho following stud
ents were given offices:
LaRuo Merrill, president; N. J.
Barlow, vlco president; Myrtlo Law,
secrotary; Aaron Home, athletic
managor; Rulon Kemp, debating
manager; Rees Maughan, eheerimis

JUNIOR HIGH
Wellsvlllo, Oct. 11. Election day,
tho most oxcltlng nnd looked for
ward to erlol of tho entlro year,
was held nt tho local Junior high
school last Friday.
From tho time school opened n
swelling of tho suppressed excite
ment grew until 10:30, and bursted
In the halls In a deafening clamor
of class yells and verbal support for
favorlto candidates. An assembly
was called at 11:00. Second year
girls wero tho first to file In, decked
In attractive dresses, and hair rib
bon of pink nnd green. They wero
closely followed by tho third year
students tastefully decorated with
Yn Ma, Ya Ma, hats ami boas of
bluo and yellow. First nnd second
year boys wero organized into a
Dutch and clown band respectively.
After 20 minutes of spirited sing
ing, the meeting was called to or
der and nominating began.
Evidences of a cleverly conducted
"political" campaign, suddenly em
erged when tho president of tho
third year class nominated n favor
ite of tho first years for secretary,
and treasurer. Balottlng continued
until 2 p. in. Pictures wero taken
of tho different classes for tho
"Embor." Votes wero counted at
2:30, aand nmld tumultous applause
the winning candidates wero an
nounced. After tho results had been
made known, the teachers were
stripped of all tho authority by tho
teeming excitement and anger over
the election.
Tho different classes lnststod that
the teachers should .wear their col
ors. This was disputed by the rlvnl
students and a near fiasco resultel
In which certain ones of tho facul
ty received "roughing."
Second years were blanked, tho
first years winning yell master nnd
secretary and treasurer and the
third duo to tho same shrewd man
ipulating won tho remaining eight
candidates. Tho victorious candi
dates and their closest competitors

feated Luther Murray for athletic
manager, by a voto of 58. Julia Ah

FIRST CONFERENCE
FOOTBALL GAME
ON SATURDAY
With n team somewhat reorganiz
ed slnco last Saturday's game tho
Utah Aggies aro going to play whnt
will doubtless bo tholr hnrdest game
this season when they meet tho Col
orado Aggies this coming Saturday.
Tho Colorado team carried off tho
Rocky Mountain championship lait
year. They have a fast, heavy team
again and aro already working in
mid season form. They recently
defeated tho Wyoming University
aggregation, 40-0. On tho othor
hand, tho Utah Aggies are showing
exceptional form. Tho weak spots
made apparent by tho ganio with
tho Salt Lako High School nro be
ing rapidly strengthened. A reorgan
ization of tho lino has resulted in
better defenso and punting practice
has materially helped that phase of
tho game. Coach Watson Is not
forecasting results, but he promis
es that the U. A. C. team will put
up a good, consistent fight.
Last Monday nnd Tuesdny fa3t
scrlmmnges were held between the
regulars and tho freshmen. W"dnes
day, Adams Field was tho scne of
a secret practice.
Watson Is not ready to nnnounco
tho lino up for Saturday as yet. That
ho will start Kapplo at quarter Is
assured, whllo It Is expected that
Twltcholl will go In at full back,
Jolinson-at right half, nnd C. Peter
son nt left half.
Somo llttlo dllllculty Is beli'g ex
perienced In getting oillclnls for the
game, but it is expected that thin
will soon bo straightened out.
