TERASSASSIN
Although Byrd Trego several times
promised to try and be decent with his
publication he has failed to do so, and
we have come to the conclusion that he
is unable to be as honorable as all
men should try to be. For this reason
we have refrained to notice his weekly
attacks upon us and other reputable
men and women who have not the abili
ty to defend themselves against his
vile attacks. But, in last week's issue
he made the insinuation that the Hon.
L. R. Thomas had a monetary interest
or some other interest in this paper,
which he accuses of possessing the rep
utation of "defending all grafters.''
Both of these accusations are cowardly,
malicious and a wilful misrepresenta
tion, and we challenge their proof.
People not acquainted very intimately
with their author, 3iav not doubt their
entire falseness, but his acquaintances
who know that his veracity is on a
par with his virtue, look upon his
weekly personal attacks not worthy of
notice, much less denial. If as he says,
the public are looking to him to ex
pose the rascality of this community,
let him publish the name of the thief
who stole the evidence out of the court
house during the recent Democratic ad
ministration that was necessary to con
vict two well known bank embezzlers.
And if he is looking Tor something of
a sensational and salaeious character,
why not publish the evidence in the case
of the State vs. Byrd Trego, Who was
tried, convicted and sentenced to the
penitentiary for the rape of an innocent
little orphan girl, to whom he promised
the state that he would be a father.
To have a man with the reputation of
the aforesaid would-be reforhier week
ly maligning the reputation of honora
ble men and women will soon be an in
tolerable calamity that will need some
severe remedy. If this false reformer
was honest in his efforts to better this
community we would give him credit,
but everybody knows that his sole ob
ject is to better himself financially
and injure his fellow men, all of whom
are his supdrioriueverysensooftheETA
are his superior in every sense of the
word. Of the two assassins, the gun
man and the penman, Wie latter is far
more despicable as he hides behind the
cloak of respectability and is generally
a moral outlaw by choice and not of
necessity, and always a coward in not
facing his victims that they might have
some redress.
SCHOOL NOTES
At a meeting of the Board of Educa
tion on Monday evening it was decided
to equip the second room of the old
gymnasium on the grounds at the rear
of the Central School and instal a sec
ond grade therein at the earliest possi.
ble date. The two second grades now
have an enrollment of one hundred and
twenty pupils which when divided up
will make three rooms of about forty
each. Several other grades have over
fifty pupils, but there seems no way
to divide them, for this will take every
available room in the present build
ing. Blnckfoot is soon to need a new
school house.
A challenge from the Albion Normal
School for a game of football has been
received anil is going to be considered.
The boys go to Idaho Falls for a game
on Friday of this week. The Sunny
Siders have won three games this sea
son in easy fashion, so Blaekfoot is
expecting a real contest.
The Parent-Teachers' Association met
on Friday afternoon and listened to
two very valuable discussions by Mrs.
E. Pearson and Miss Doyle. The paper
presented by the latter was along the
line of difficulties met by teachers in
their work and ways in which par
ents could co-operate, while Airs.
Pearson looked at the subject
from the parents' standpoint. Many
interesting and helpful facts were
brought out. Miss Turner favor
ed the Association with two beau
tifully executed piano solos, and Mrs.
Dygert sang with unusual graciousness
two well chosen selections.
The County Teachers' Association
will meet on Friday of this week in the
High School Auditorium. The morn
ing session will be taken up with visits
to the various rooms of the Blaekfoot
schools. In the afternoon a program
and discussion will be the order of the
day. Every teacher in the county is
expected to attend these meetings.
Superintendent Vincent has charge
of the superintendent ana principal's
section at the Pocatello Institute this
year and will present the methods of
applying the standard tests in all
branches of the common schools as well
as other standardizing conditions. At
the conclusion of the week 's work an
attempt will be made to organize a
"Testing Club'' for the schools of
South Eastern Idaho.
The High School in presenting
"Zwangill's Melting Pot" offers an
other of the highest class of attraction
that is on the road. A canceled date in
western Idaho made it possible to se
cure this attraction, as they do not
make towns the size of Blaekfoot or
dinarily. It is the aim of the High
School management to give only the
very best, and with Lucy Gates" as a
starter this year, "The Melting Pot"
as the second attraction, a record for
high class stuff has been made that is
hard to equal.
Wise buyers read the ads before they
go to the store to spend their money.
If the ad isn't there they don't read
it. The wise merchant will take the
bint.

Mr. John Teeples appeared before the
Board and offered to construct the
fence, 160 rods, at 40 cents per rod
and furnish the material, also that he
would move a certain ditch that now
crosses the road and thereby eliminate
the necessity of a culvert. After due
consideration the Board ordered Mr.
Teeples to construct the said fence
for 4 0 cents per rod and be allowed
$15.000 for the changing of the ditch,
and Mr. Teeples agrees to pay for the
material used in the construction of
this fence, and carry the account until
such lime as there are funds in the
Hoad and Bridge Fund to pay for the
same.

Tribute to Life of
Neil F. Boyle Jr.
"Our lives are songs—God writes the
words,
And we set them to music at pleas
ure,
And the music grows sad or sweet or
glad
As we choose to fashion the meas
In the "Orchestm of Life" our Neil,
Jr., had sung his pari Joyously and
harmoniously if we would judge by the
loving telegrams and the garlands of
beautiful flowers that were sent to
his dear ones as an appreeiation of his
life and influence.
There has not been as much sunshine
in our little city since the word came
that this loving boy only had a fight
ing chance for his life. Everyone knew
they would miss the bright smile and
cheery word he always had ready. He
was never in too much of a hurry to
give the children a ride; to take part
in any worthy cause, or to take time to
! adjust any difficulty.
j He had early learned the lesson of
self denial; when the question came of
■his choosing a career and profession
he manfully gave up his own desire to
be with the dear father who was more
like an older brother to him. He show
ed keen business ability and his three
years of earnest application soon prov
ed that he was trustworthy. The beau
tiful floral piece, "The Broken Wheel,"
sent by the employes under him attest
ed more feelingly of their apprecition
of liis character than words can de
scribe.
Our Neil, Jr., is not dead, he has just
journeyed into "The Far Country."
The influence of the beautiful song
he sang will live forever in the hearts
of this community. The little sister
COMMUNITY LOYALTY
Every community has him, every
community cusses him, and every com
munity tolerates him.
He is usually an unsuccessful business
man whose objectionable ways have
been the direct cause of his losing in
the game of life. He must needs vent
his spleen on some one or some tiling.
Admitting no fault in himself, ergo,
the fault must be in his environment—
hence he knocks.
He is a pestiferous cuss, and as little
as we may believe it, he really does
harm.
He is sure to get the ear of many
new men in town and pours into their
ears' his abuse of the place. Accord
ing to him conditions are all cross
wise. The business men are cheats and
swindlers. To his way of thinking
there isn't a decent merchant or me
hanic, in the place. Even the laborers
are lazy and trifling. The town is dead
and is no place for a live man to tarry.
His soured soul fairly writhes and
squirms with sardonic joy when lie
sees that his miasmatic mouthiiigs are
having their intended effect upon the
victim. That is the knocker—that is
his story, his way.
If there is a public enterprise plan
ned that needs eo-operation and united
effort he is immediately possessed of
a superior wisdom and begins with glee
to point out all of the weak spots.
No calculations can by any possibility
work out as intended. Men upon whom
the enterprise depends will prove weak
or traitors. The plans are all wrong.
The whole thing is a piece of stupend
ous folly, and he for one will have noth
ing to do with it.
But what a pity he will not! That
would be all the community would ask
of him and his mouth.
And thus it goes on year after year.
Does it have any effect, you askt
It certainly does. The business life of
a community, contrary to the opinions
of many, is susceptible to the influence
from adverse critics. Perhaps not half
of his hearers know the real cause of
his pessimistic knocking«, and in many
minds a doubt lingers and things that
should go with a rush are unacountably
slow and lagging.
But what, say you, can we do with
him?
May we make a suggestion? Every
time this insect opens his mouth to
knock tell him plainly that there are
quite a number of roads leading away
from the town, and cordially invite him
to take one of them and follow it to its
end.
And let every loyal citizen of the town
give him the same advice.

who is mourning so bitterly for his
merry chum will endeavor to fill the

loved, a greater peace will fall oil all
communicants and while the dear par
ents are today in their Gethsemane of
Life, mourning as -those who cannot
be comforted, they will some day know
they gave to the world a beautiful
singer whose influence cannot die.
Neil would not have us weep for
long, the merry whistle with which he
greeted you oil his way to his morn
ing's work and his evening song betok
ened the spirit in which he would take
such sorrow. There must not be the
sadness of fnrewelll—rather the illum
ined thought, "I Know that My Re
deemer Liveth, und I shall live with
him."
' Sunset and evening star
And one clear call for me,
Ami may there be no moaning of the
bar
When I*put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems
asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the
deep
Turns again home.
Twilight ami evening bell,
And after that the dark,
And may there be no sadness of fare

When I embark.
For tho' from out our bourne of time
and place,
The flood may bear me far;
I hope to meet my pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.
THE KNOCKER
Have you ever stopped to consider
the fact that loyalty to community in
terests iH the highest type of patriot
ism ! Show us the man who is loynl
and true to every interest of his own
community and we will show you in
that same individual a man in whom
his country can repose absolute confi
dence in any emergency that calls for
his allegiance.
On the other hand, the man who is
careless and unconcerned for the inter
ests of his community is more than apt
to display the same spirit of indiffer
ence toward his government or his
state should any serious danger threat
en either.
One of the most commendable traits
of the old Scotch highlanders was their
loyalty to their own clan. Good or bad,
right or wrong, the clan had their first
allegiance. The life and services of
each member were always cheerfully
placed at the disposal of the clan.
Try to imagine an entire state com
posed of innumerable communities weld
ed and eemented into a symmetrical
whole, each striving to excel the other,
but each, from its own local loyalty,
developing a broader and deeper loyal
ty that reaches out and embraces the
whole.
Utopia, you say? By no means.
Merely what could and would be the
result if we could only be brought to
see that we owe allegiance to our own
people, but^ that the prosperity of
others is in no wise a detriment to us,
but,rather a help; that if each com
munity would develop itself to the ut
most—physically, mentally and moral
ly—none would need be envious of
aught to detract from another's inter
ests.
Let us develop community loyalty
to the full—the highest possible form
of patriotism.

N. F. BOYLE JR.
Sunday afternoon all that was mor
tal of Neil F. Boyle, Jr., passed from
among us forever. His funeral service«
took place at the Catholic church, which
was inadequate to accommodate half
the deceased's friends and admirers,
who represented all classes, races and
religion, as he was a respector and idol
of them all. The floral offerings were
both bountiful and beautiful. The
choir rendered appropriate and touch
ing music. Mrs. John Dygert of Arco
sung "The Holy City,"" and Mrs. S.
W. Wilson snug "Lead Kindly Light."
Father Gresl rendered a short but im
presssive sermon on the inevitability of
death that was a solace to the grief
stricken bereaved, and a warning to all
to be prepared for the death that none
can escape. Almost a hundred auto
loads of mourners for the dead and
sympathizers for the living bereaved
followed the remains to the cemetery
and saw them deposited in their eternal
resting place of mother earth, that was
