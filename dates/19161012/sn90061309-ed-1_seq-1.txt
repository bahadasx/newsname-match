Bloodhounds Kept Busy. Out Three
Times Within a Week.
Hunter Anderson and his
blood
hounds have had a busy week,
Thursday night three boys living
southwest of town borrowed Warren
Fuqua's roadster without his per
mission and spent the night in
Hannibal. They pushed the car
out of the lot and down the road
some distance before they started
the engine and when they returned
they left the car standing in the
road some distance from the house.
When Mr. Fuqua discovered what
had been done he called Hunter
Anderson to bring his dogs and
they were at the car about 9:30
Friday morning The dugs went
right to the home of one of the
boys aud be confessed and told who
was with him. The boys were
compelled to pay $60.00 for dam
age to the car and services of the
dogs. This was the first run the
dogs had made for four months and
they made it like they had been in
constant training. Sunday after
noon about 4.30 o'clock Jim Jones
who lives 14 miles south of Mon
roe phoned to Mr. Anderson to
bring the dogs out. Some'one had
been io bis watermelon patch and
maliciously destroyed 200 melons.
The misdemeanor was not discov
ered until Sunday tho it had been
dune some time before. The dogs
followed the trail fur about seven
miles, crossing the river a number
of times. They worked all night
much of the time wading in water
but the guilty party escaped. The
dogs were badly cut and bruised
on this trip. Monday evening about
7 o'clock Mr. Anderson was notified
that two suits of clothing and a side
of bacon had been taken from a
caboose while in Monroe. The loss
was discovered about the time the
train reached Palmyra but as the
car was gone there was nothing
to worn irom wnen given a
chance the dogs will find the guilty
party. The old dogs and their 10
pups held quite a reception at An
derson's store Friday afternoon.
The pups are now a month old.
Some of them have been sold and
will be delivered when old enough
to be taken from the niothet.

joined the procession, and as the
clergy took their places in the
sanctuary the Veni Creator was im
pressively sung by the choir, while
the Bisnop was being vested. In
the course of the exercises bis
Lordship took occasion to bring
home to the assembled congrega
tion the important meaning of the
edifying spectacle it was their
privilege to witness. "Such a scene"
his Grace said "is always a source
of a very special joy to the church
beeause it helps to make firm in
the hearts of so many of her
cmidren tne tender plant ot virtue
It brings one back" he con
tinued "in spirit to the day of
Penticost when in the upper cham
ber in Jerusalem, the Holy Ghost
came down on the apostles for the
inauguration of the New Law and
to effect in their lives a wonderful
change, completing that which be
fore was imperfect, and filling men
who had till then been so timid
and hesitating, with light and
strength, made them go forth like
giants, rejoicing to run the career
now opened before them" "Since
then" his Lordship contended "the
Holy Ghost is the inward soul and
spirit of the church, infusing nod
preserving life within her, guiding
her in her teaching, animating her
n her trial's, and leading her con
.1 ant I y forward in the steady ami
successful career which, notwith-
stanuing many tribulations, is to
sue in her triumph." Passing from
this general consideration of the
work of the Holy Ghost in the
church the Bishop said that in our
ownlivts. in each in livi lual soul, the
Holy Ghost has a work to do, ami
it behoves us to remember and to
ippreciate that work, for us the
hurch was perfected when He
came down upon His mission and
began his work in that upper
hainber in Jerusalem, so do we
become perfect bv His operation
Each one has a perfection to which
he must aspire and it is through
the work of the Holy Spirit that he
is to attain to it, for it is the
presence and working of the Hol
Spirit in the individual soul that
effects its sanctity, The wonder
ful influence which this presense
exercised over the soul of each of
the Apostles is that which will be
exercised over our soul also if we
cherish the presence within us. In
the glorious day of Penticost the
timid and vacillating apostles were
strengthened and fitted for their
arduous work, and in every sub
sequent age of the church it has j

About sixty people from Monroe
and vicinity attended the Dairy
Meeting at Hannibal Tuesday This
indicates that our people are get
ting greatly interested in this branch
id industry which means more pro
fits for the fanner and more pros
perity for the community. A Dem
ocrat representative had the pleas
ure of going to Hannibal in A. Jae
ger's splendid car and greatly en
joyed the trip. The owners of curs
kindly look ninny who desired to
attend this meeting which will act
as a great incentive to a greater
dairy industry.
Twenty-live i ounties were repre
sented. Splendid practical men
were the speakers and the tlmr
uiighly under.-tand the business and
know that it is profitable whenever
intelligently followed The North
east Missouri Bankers are to re
asked to aid in the dairy farm pro
ject such as has been successfully
practiced in many places nnd has
proven beneficial alike to farmers
and business men. The Democrat

time on this subject of such vital
interest to our community. Talk to
any of our successful dairymen and
see what they will tell you then
arrange to give the business a trial,
,and we thi,,k you wi find profit.
