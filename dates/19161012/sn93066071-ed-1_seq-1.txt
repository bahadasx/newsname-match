A young man's bank book is an indication that he is under
real headway.
The young man with a bank accountMs already "getting on"
Jn the world. It indicates prosperity and habits of industry and
business that augur well for his future.
And it is a testimony not only to tangible possessions but to
personal qualities that have much to do with winning the admira

NARROWLY AVOIDED CRASH.
Wlille returning to the ofllce about
the noon hour .Saturday, when a Inrrti
crowd of people were In town and the
ftreets were lined with automobiles
and teams, we witnessed what was a
mighty narrow escape from a Miiash-up
between two cars, and had the acci
dent occured it would have been the
fault of no one except the two drtrers
of tho machines who were violating
the city ordinance by speeding and
who were not using ordinary precau
tion when approaching an intersection
of streets. One car was going up
Douglas avenue at a speed far ex
ceeding the limit of twelve miles
per hour. The other car was coming
down a tide street at an equally fast
rate. Neither driver seemed to hare
any idea that another car, vehicle or
pedeitrian might be on the face of the
earth. They drove as if they thought
the whole highway had been dedicated
to their own use. When they reached
the corner the chance for a smash-up
was never better and was only nar
rowly averted. On car swerved to
the left, the other shot by barely
missing it. Suppose either driver had
lost bis head, which might easily have
happened to at least one of the driven
for one car was loaded with girls, who
let forth a Comanche war whoop
when they shw their danger. Or sup
pose a little child had been passing the
corner just at that time. What the
result might have, been is horrible to
contemplate. A speed ordinance has
been adopted and the principal streets
have been adequately posted. We see
no reason why speeders should not be
''pulled" and put an end to the danger
which Is lurking in the- pathway of
car drivers who wish to use care, as
well as to pedestrians, vehicles and
little children. We lmve even seen
eome'-drivers go so far as to put on ex
tra "juice" and speed past the speed
limit sign posted in the middle of
Douglas avenue. The arrest and as
sessing of a good stiff line might have &
tendency to bring some of theso smart
alecks to time Such contempt for
law and order should not be allowed
to go unpunished. We care not who
the. vlolater'of the' spued ordinance
may be. Let him abide by the city
ordinances or suffer the penalty.
A CORRECTION.
In the article which we published
laBt week concerning the first prize
wheat from Heaver county and in Which
we stated the same was exhibited by
J, W. Gambs, of Knowles. it is evident
that we were misinformed an the fol
lowing communication will explain:
Knowles, Oklahoma, Oct. Oth, 1010.
Editor Beaver Herald :
Your informant was certainly mis
taken in regard to the Heaver county
wheat which.took first premium at the
State Fair. This wheat was raised
by Karl Alkire,on his farm east of
Knowles and was sent by Mr. Alkire
to the State fair, he paying all expenses
and being awarded the premium on
the same, having received a check from
the Secretary of the State Fair and Ex
position. Mr. Gambs was not the exhi
bitor or price winner and had nothlnu
to do with th wheat except to assist
in the grading of the same.
A Reaped.
Along with the same letter calling
our attention to the error, was a.letter
from F M, Gault, president of the
State Board of Agriculture, to Mr.
Alkire, asking permission to exhibit
the wheat at the International Dry
Farming CongresB, at El Paso, Texas.
We are glad to make the correction
and give Mr. Alkire credit. Mistakes
will creep in but no one is more wil
ling than the Herald to right an error
and we do so cheerfully in this case
and thank our reader for calling the
matter to our attention. All that we
said in praise of Mr. Gambs for the
work which we Jiad been informed he
had done, we cheerfully pass on to Mr.
Alkire and moro for, lie was not only
the exhibitor but the producer and i
certainly tntitled to a great deal of
credit for his energy.
' CUPID RUNS RIOT.
In our iFsue last week the Herald
predicted nt least two nuptials at an
early date but Cupid went us one bet
ter and stayed ttvo more victims so that
