ON BOARD PRESIDENT WIL
SON'S SPECIAL, Harrisburg, Pa.,
Oct. 11 As a result of the confer
ence last night and early today
between President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing at Long Branch
X. J., it was stated authoritative
ly tonight that no evidence of the
breaking of Gorman promises to
the United States had been dis
covered so far in connection with
the submarine activities off the
American coast last Sunday, but
that the American government
will continue its Investigations
and will watch closely for any
repitition of the attacks.
The only direct comment on the
discussion between the President and
Secretary Lansing obtainable' from
official sources tonight was that every
angle of the submarine situation had
been discussed during the conference.
Reaction Net- Welcomed

Gerard Stops Rumors c
NEW YORK. Oct. 11. James W.
Gerard, ambassador to Germany, who
returned yesterday on his first vaca
tion in nearly three years, issued a
formal statement late today in which
he denied that his home coming had
been caused by the need of warning
the administration at Washington of
Germany's intention to resume indis
criminate submarine warfare against
neutral as well as hostile shipping.
The ambassador's statement follows:
Germany Keeps Faith
"You may say that it Is not true
that I came home at this time to serve
notice on the President of Germany's
intention to repudiate her pledges re
garding the conduct of submarine
warfare, or that Germany was contem
plating the resumption of submarine
attacks fpon all kinds of shipping.
Relations Friendliest
"I sav to you what I said to a re
porter for the Berliner Tageblatt at
Copenhagen before I sailed: 'I should j
not thinly of leaving my post at this j
time if I wore not confident that re- j
lations between my country and Ger-i

shouted re-rarks at the speakers.
"What are you going to do for rev
