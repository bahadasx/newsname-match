Q. A. BANGS'W AE
HOT Flv -CONGRESS
The progressive, element of all
parties in the First Gongressianal
District will be glad to know that
Hon. George A. Bangs of Graid
Forks* will make ai active camp
aign for election on the demo
ctratic ticket.
George Bangs should be elected
There are a hundred good rea
sons why he should be elected and
not one why he should not be.
North Dakota is one of the best
states in the union. We who live
here believe it is the BEST state
in the union. We have the great
est per capita of wealth, the
highest ratiig for intelligence,
the largest number of schools a.id
churches, the most modern, the
best stock and the best grain.
The towns and cities are the best
and (acording to population') we
lead nearly every state in the
union in everything worth while,
except statesmanship at Washing
ton. Instead of sending our
strongest men ip Washington,
men who by virtue of their,ability
could do much for the state, we
have been sending weak men.
Particularly is this true in the
First District. The First District
is .not fairly represented at Wash
ington—it is not represented at
all. It is time to make a change,
to send a man to the national
capital in whom every citizen
will take pridte a man who has
the ability to do things for the
district and the state a man who
will measure up to the best a
mai who will be an honor and
credit to North Dakota. Thous
ands of republicans realize the
necessity of making a change, a
fact that was emphasized in the
primary campaign when a protest
vote was registered by republic
ans for a .new man who made such
a short campaign that less than
a fourth of the voters had opport
unity to meet him, and who would
easily have been nominated had
he soonor decided to be come a
candidate.
COLE AND POLLOCK
Down in the Third Judicial Dis
trict people are looking forward
to a rather unusual race for the
district judgeship between At
torney A. T. Cole and Judge Pol
lock. In the primaries, con
trary to the predicltion of the pol
iticians, Cole ran very strong, pol
ling a vote that almost equalled
that of Polock. Up to that time
it was thought possible to dis
lodge Jud£e Polock or to seriou
sly endanger his re-election. Cole
strength was surprising and
heartened his friends to make a
tremendous effort to bring about
his election in the final round
this fall.
The people of the state general
ly will watch with great interest
the result of this race, not only
because of the importance of the
judgeship in the Third judttcia
district where much of the im
portant litigation of the state is
threshed out, but because Cole
and Pollock so clearly represent
two widely differing ideas of our
political life-
Pollock has been judge for a
considerable time. He is of tin?
suave, polished, culture, type of
lawyer, a strong believer in
pro.
perty rights. All his time on the
bench in this state Pollock has
been on better terms with the oI.I
standpat McKenzie machine t'han
with the progressive forces. Two
years ago he went out of his way
to publish an endorsement of Han
.na/for governor, which helped de
feat Burdick and saddled the Hasi
na machine on North Dakota long
to make North Dak'otans complete
ly lose confidence in their state
government. Pollock's long time
friendship with the state politi
cal-business machine has not
been unrewarded and today every
particle of strength of the old
machine djown in that district is
being quietly thrown behind him
to defeat Cole.
11 contrast with Pollock's ideals
and charteristics Cole's per
sonality and record stand out
Sharply. Where Polock is
handsome and debonair in ap
pearnace. Cole is homely, plain,
rugged. While Pollock has been
spending his years currying the
favor of the reactionaries. Cole
has been leading the progressive
fight in that section of the state
with a persistence and force that
have helped bring about many
progressive victories. Pollock is
.today likely better off in the
goods of the world than is Cole.
Cole undoubtedly in an unusual
degree is known and admired for
his sincerity, his rugged honesty.
Thus each man has achieved
something of Hip reward for
which he has worked.
If we were down in the Third
district we do not think it wouM
be hard for us to make our choice
for judge on November 7th.
Either man has had enough ex­
perience in law to qualify him for
the position on that score- Pol
lock, while on the bench for a con
siderable time a id naturally pro
fiting by such experience, is not
possessed of more legal ability
than Cole is. In fact Pollock is
reversed by the supreme court
rather more than most judges of
the state. On the other ha ad
Cole has a clean cut, common
sense mind and honest heart that
go to make the highest type of
judge. If we had a lot at stake
and were the under dog in a law
suit we would rather see Cole try
our case than Pollock for we be
lieve Cole would stand like a rock
for justice though all the poli
tical and business power of a
community were thrown into the
scaes to change his decision. It
is for that reason that we would
vote for him if we lived in the
Third district.
PIONEER MERCHANT GOING
OUT OF BUSINE88
Mr- John Bjornson of the Bos
ton Store has decided to retire
from buisness because of poor
health. Mr. Bjornson came to
Wahpeton in 1885 and was first
employed as salesman for E. E.
Howry.. He later went into the
dry goods buisness for himself'
one door west of the present loca
tion. In 1898 he moved into the
new building, where he- has
since, conducted a first class dry
goods store. Although Mr. Bjorn
son has disposed of much of his
property here he is still heavily
interested in Richland County
real estate and expects to make
Wahpeton his home.
MILLIONS FOR PEACE.
NO 'JIT* FOR WILSON
Ford Will Give President Good
Wishes and Moral Aid, But
Not Coin
Long Branch, N. J.,—Henry
Ford, philanthropist, automobile
manufacturer and millionaire,
was asked, after he had talked for
four hours with President Wilson
at Shadow Lawn, the summer
White House, Monday if he in
tends to m8ke a contributio ntw
the Wilson campaign fujid.
"Contribution!" re-echoed the
Detroit wizard. 'I should say not
"Why not?" was the next ques
tion.
'Because." answered Mr. Ford
after a pause. "I believe the
office should seek the man and
not the man the office,"
"Then you will not contribute
1,000,000 or more to the Wilson
campaign fund, as has been re
ported you will?"
"Most certainly not," replied
the Detroit, manufacturer. "In
the case of Mr. Wilson the office
just now is seeking the man and
there is no reason why 1 cent
should be expended to change the
situation and make it appear that
the man is seeking the office."
"What do you believe are the
possibilities of the re-election of
Mr. Wilson?" was asked.
"If the American people are
sane—and I believe they are—Mr.
Wilson will be re-elected
and
by a
large majority ip the eliectorial
college."
PEACE OR WAR
Two significant campaign
speeches were made last Satur
day.
Their significance lay in the
fact that the issue, as to the at
titude of this nation toward the
European war, was clearly joined
between President Wilson and
opponents.
The President spoke at Shadow
Lawn for himself and the Demo
cratic party.
Col. Roosevelt spoke at Battle
Creek for candidate Hughes a li
the Republican party-
President Wilson said: "The
certain prospect of the success of
the Republican party is that we
shall be drawn into the embroil
ments of the European war."
Former President Roosevelt
said. "Wilson keeps us out of
war! Neither Washington .nor
Lincoln kept us out of war. They
put righteousness before peace.
President. Wilson by his policy of
tame submission to insult and in
jury from all whom he feared lias
invited the murder of our men,
women and children."
President Wilson has kept, ihis
country out of the European war
and declares (hat the Republicans
will get us into it.
Roosevelt, speaking for Hughes
and the Republican, verifies the
president's statements. More
than that, for a starter, he points
to Germany and Mexico as the
powers first to be fought.
Judge Hughes has not repud
iated the Roosevelt statement and
he will not.

WAHPETON, RICHLAND COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY OCTOBER 12th. 1916
SOME REASONS WHY WOMEN
SHOULD BE FOR WILSON
Extract from a speech at Butte
Montana, October 12th, by Hon. C.
A. Towne of New York, who, under
the auspices of the Democtratic
National Committee, is making a
transcontinental speaking tour
for the re-election of Pres. Wil
son:
"It was in the audience hall of
.the Palatial Hotel, Baltimore, New
York. Four hundred women had
assembled, pursuant to a call by
Chairman McCormick of the De
moctratic National Committee, to
organize a nation-wide movement
among women for the re-election
of the President. The hall was
crowded. I was the only man
tltere. I felt somewhat like a
new Claudius at a revival of the
Elusinian mysteries. I was im
pressed, overawed- Something
pervasive but elusive, subtle but
dominant, held me in a mood of
sympathetic anticipation. Here
were women from every uarter
of the great city, from every
walk of its multifarious life, ev
ery phase of its diversified pur
suits. Fifth Avenue was here
Riverside Drive Forty-second
Street the East Side. Socieiy
women there were artists, auth
ors, newspaper and magazine
,writers telephone operators wo
men and girls from the factories
stenographers. Silk gowns rust
led against neat but inexpensive
.suits of woolen stuff. The cost
ly millinery fashion was in coun
sel with the modest finery of
homely self-respect. It was a
Democracy of womanshood.
Almost. Something was yet
wanting. Convention had' not
utterly relaxed. In some eyes
still lingered the vague sugges
tion of difference, the accustom
ed consciousness of class-
But only for a little. The chair
woman, a venerable lady from
Boston, of a long and honorable
history in good works, after a few
earnest and informing words, in
troduced a little, slender, modest
woman in a plain browi suit and
simple hat of black, with a
thoughtful face and large, dark,
luminous eyes. Slowly, but un
hesitatingly, she came to the front
of the platform. Her features
[lighted up with just the sugges
tion of a smile and her deep
glance swept the faces before
her. She waited for perhaps a
minute. Every movement in the
room ceased. Every noise was
stilled. Every eye was focused
on the litle figure in the fore
ground. Reaching out her hands
in a graceful gesture, too gentle
to seem like command, too res
trained to seem like appeal, yet
which was both, she spoke. Her
voice was Ibw but resonant un
forced and natural, but audible
throughout the assemblage.
"Sisters," she said- A single
word, and paused. The voice had
no accent of assertiveness. It
carried no challenge. It was
just an unpremeditated and ir
resistible call from the soul of a
workingwoman, wife and motlier
to that undercurrent of woman
hood which rolls through all hu
man history and enlaps the
world.
"Sisters!" The spell sad hem
cast. Before it every remnant
of reserve fell from every glance.
When next she spoke it was thru
no modifying medium but heart
to-heart, one woman to all wo
men.
"Why ain I for the re-election
of Woodrow Wilson?" I will tell
you why. It is because my
husband is a workingman. and
Woodrow Wilson has done more
for workiiiginen than any other
President we ever hadl It. is be
cause I am a workingwoman, and
Woodrow Wilson has done mon
for workingwomen than any
other
President. It is because my
husband and I have children, and
Wootfrow Wilson has done more
for the children of the workers ot^
America than any other President,
It is because we want our children
to grow up to a better condil-iou
than our own because we wish
them to profit by the splendid
school system that the spirit
of
American institutions has opened
to every child: and because we
cannot hope that they may df» this
if they
are to face tho
drudgery of premature toil in
mine and factory belVire their
their bodies are grown and their
fibre knit. The Child-Labor Law
is Woodrow Wilson's proclama
tion of Emancipation to the
children slaves of America. It is
because, again, I want more of
the humanities and refinements
of the home, more hours to culti
vate the grace of domestic as
sociation- more opportunities to
know books and pictures and
music: a chance for my husband
when he goes to work, to look in
to the eyes of his wife and his
little boy and girl, and to kiss us
good-bye, by daylight. Woodrow
Wilson's championship of the 8-
hoiur working-day is the pro
phecy of an era in which shall be
approximately realized the dreams
of the founders of this Republic
when they had visions of the
brotherhood of man.
And, finally, I am for Woodrow
Wilson because he bears aloft the
torch of true Americanism, of the
gos'pel of the equal rights of all
states, large and small, in the
famiy of nations, a.id of equal op
portunity to all citizens, rich and
poor, powerful and weak* within
the Republic principles writen in
to the Declaration of Indepen
dence and into the orginal charter
of Democracy by Thomas Jeffer
son, and whose championship
and defense his great successor
has worthily inherited and .lobly
exercised."
Need I say that thenceforward
the meeting was a consecration?
Not one of us left that room with
out''the consciouness of a Pente
costal blessing."
FORTNIGHTLY CLUB MEETS
Last Monday evening the Fort
nightly Club met at the home of
Mrs. E. P. Cox on ninth street N
The president Miss Mirick presid
ed. After a short buisness ses
sion, Mrs. Duden and Mrs. Frazer
gave an interesting book review
of "The "Inside of the Cup." It
was followed by a paper on Cur
rent Events, ably handled by Miss
Mirick. At the close of the pro
gram the hostess served dainty
refreshments.
Besides the Club members there
were three vistors present.
THINKS BURKE WILL WIN
Senator E- J. Johnson has just
returned from a trip through the
.northwest part of the state and
when seen today by a Hearald
reporter was very optomistic con
cerning democtratic chances.
When his atention was called' to
thd fight John Burke is making
for the se.natorship in North Dak
alQ the senator said:
"I have been watching the "Sen
atorial fight in North Dakota be
tween Senator Mc Cumber, repub
licnn, and John Burke, democtrat'
w0s"neen interest, and it lpoks'lo
me as though Mr. Burke will win
out.
"There is no doubt in my mind
but that President Wilson will be
re-elected. From every indica.
tion, he will carry South Dakota.
In view of what the last session of
Congress did in the way of pass
i.ig legislation helpful to the
farmer and buisness man, and the
great prosperity of North Dakota
is now enjoying, her electoral
voles will doubtless go to Mr.
Wilson.
"It seems to me that every
voter in North Dakota would
pause and think what it really
means to his state to have a re
presentative -the Senate in har
mony with the administration.
Burke is thoroughly acquainted
with its need and his candidacy
shold strongly appeal to the pride
of every North Dakotan. He has
filled the office of Treasurer of
the United Slate- with great credit
to himself, his state and the
countiy.
I -The fact that Mr. Burke hell
I the office of Governor of North
Dakota for three successive terms
in spite of the fiercest republi
can opposition, should go a long
way in conclusively settling the
question of his fitness for the of
fice of Senator

0 WHY I AM FOR PRES. WILSON
By Irving Fisher
Professor of Political Economy,
Yale University and Memeber of
.President Roosevelt's National
Conservation Commission:
1 attended the three conven
tions in Chicago and St. Louis,
also some meetings of their plat
form committees, was present at
Mr. Hughes' ceremony of accept
ance and have read carefully the
important documents and speech
es of the campaign. After care
ful consideration, have joined
the Wilson Independent League
I thoroughly believe that the best
interest of the couutry requires
M. Wilson's re-election.
My chief reasons for voting
for President Wilson follow:
1. The so-called issues oi
"Americanism,"pi'tfparedness, the
Lustitania incident, the Mexican
situation, and ah others that
have grown out of foreign affairs,
appear to me to be merely "red
herrings across the trail" intend
ed to put the public off the scent.
I have little doubt that by divert
ing attention from themselves to
these trumped up issues, the Re
publican "old guard" hope to "put
over" on the oublic another "Pay
ne-Aldrich" tariff. They ex
pect to work the war and Mexico
for all they are worth to both
hide and' guide their won private
intersts after the election.
2. Moreover, quite irrespec
tive of the moral issue in "protec
tion" it seems to me bad national
policy to keep the tariff longer in
politics. The election of Mr.
Hughes would surely do this. That
,of Mr. Wilson would at least go
far toward dropping the ha riff
out of politics and toward taking
worth noting that if such a re
sult can be accomplished through
a tariff commission- it will cer
tainly .lot be through a tariff
commission appoi ted by protec
tionists.
3. I believe at heart, Mr. Wil
son's Mexican policy is sounder
than that which MV. Hughes seems
to endorse. Few of the Ameri
can people realize, as Mr. Wil
son realizes, that here, too. is a

If Mr. Hughes is elected, the Sen
