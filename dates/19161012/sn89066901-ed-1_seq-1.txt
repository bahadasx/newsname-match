THEY WERE ALL HERE
Large Crowds, Fine Exhib
its, Good. Attractions
. Fair" Features
Favorable weather conditions
and good crowds of merry muk
eis- inaiked every one of the
three days of Manrdield's Fifth
Annual Agricultural and Stock
Show, held Oct. 5, ti and 7 in the
Gem City of the O.u ks. The
siiow lived up to its name of the
World's Fair of the ftearks. Ex
hibits were good in evt ry de
partments there was p'enty of
au usement for ail, and refresh
aient stands provided food and
drink for the hungry and thirs
ty. With; the exception of a few
disturbances, good order. pre
vailed throughout t lie fair. The
handling of iui h lurge crowds
was no small job, and our officers
ure to be coin mended tor ine
zeal witli which they kept down
trouble and quelled disturbances
when they arose. Friday was
Ih- big day, the crowd that day
being the largest of any of the
three days. There was also an
enormous crowd Saturday, ami
big crowd Thursday; in fact,
.there were lotsfif people. here all
week.
From Thursday morning, bri
ght and early, to Saturday mid
night was one continuous round
of music, fun and frolic, the car
nival spirit being manifested ev
erywhere. The fair this year
was one of the best ever held
here, the people being determin
ed to have a good time in a good
way; that is. most of them.
Some few seemed determined to
have what they considered a
good time, hut in a wrong way,
hut they were in the minority.
Most of our people and visitors
had the right spirit'and we were
gliid to have them here, but there
are some we wish" had stayed
away, or if they must come, we
wish they hud gone way back
and sat down and behaved them
selves. All in all, it was a satis
factory affair and a worthy dem
onstration of the fact that we al
ways taise good things in the
Ozarks, that our women folk are
skilled in the domestic sciences
and the tine "art of needle work,
and that our school children are
there with the goods . in their
school work.
The public school was dismis
sed Thursday at noon for the
week and the school children
and .teachers, together with the
janitor, paraded from the school
house to the park, headed by the
Mansfield Concert Band, whose
music livened up the march
The children sang and gave their
yells in the park, and this fea
ture proved one of the enjoyable
incidents oJ the fair. '
Friday seemed to be Seymour
day, as on that day our city was
invaded by ahostof Seymourites
headed by; their splendid band,
and Col. Carl Garner of the Sey
mour Citizen; secretary of the
Ozark Press Association and one
of the. best boosters of the Oz
arks. The Seymour people took
Vis by storm; and we are proud
of the large delegation they sent.
They never do things by halves;
they were all here. Their band
lis in excellent condition, and the
line music they gave U9 during
their stay here added much to
the day's exercises and was
highly appreciated, being highly
complimented by all. . Large del
egations from all the other sur
rounding cities and villages were
also present that day, and every
"other day. The Hartyille schools
were dismissed Friday in order
that the HartviHe school children
might, visit the fair that day, in
company with Cal Huntsinger's
fatuous. Kid Band, whose "music,
notwithstanding the youth of the
band, is of a high order. Their
coming was timely and appreci
ated, and their musical selections
were given a hearty reception.
The county seat was practically
deserted Friday and Saturday,
while' their citizens visited the
wir. some or tne oeymour
crowd were alau hare Saturday.
The stores and banks at Hart
vi:le closed Friday in order that
all might atnd the Mansfield
fair.. We appreciate this cour
tesy on the part of our county
seat friends. .

This was the logical place to be,
and they' were. M the logical
place.' "We have never failed to
please." Tbf people know that
Mansfield always has all sliead
veriises, and more, too. 1'rors

success.

ant the fair management wouui
have been . up" against it for a
poultry judge. Mi Andrews
a judxe oi.au kiiios oi puuivry,
ami we understand there is only
one other judge of all Varieties in
the state. He was urged by the
St. Louis fair ptspt''Urt,ou&ad
judge the Hullry tliere at a good
salary, but instead he came U
Manstield and donated his ser
vices. Men like that are few
and far between, but then Mr.
Andrew sis an exceptionally good
all around man. The Springfield
papers contained the statement
that he was to judge the poultry
at their fair" awl finally, said He
was unable to attend to the same
on account of sickness. Mr.
Andrews was not asked to judge
there, so there is a mistake
somewhere. Was someone just
trying to make use of his reputa
tion?
A new feature of this year's
display was a 1niner.il depart
ment, in which A; T. Friend
made a fine exhibit, showing
that the mineral deposits here
are well worth looking after.
Tne award for the finest d is
play of poultry was-won by the
junior editor of theVMirror, who
we believe, has more varieties of
pure bred poultry than anyone
in thlscommunity. This item is
written by the senior-editor with
out the junior editor's knowledge
or consent, so please do not say
anything to her about it.
H. M. Norcross' 800 pound Po

Saturday was Republican day,
for which occasion music was
also furnished by the Mansfield
Concert Band. The speakers or
the day were Hon. Ashley H.
Harrison of Steelville, Republ
can nominee for congress from
the 16th district, and Hon. R. L
Johnston of Pulaski county, who
spoke to a large audience in the
big "tent at 11 a.m. Preceding

Mrs. Gorman, and Joe H. Den-

erous banners wun appropriate
wording made a pleasing feature
of the parade, and while there
was an enthusiastic crowd of Re
publicans ah ng the line of march.
The Democrats, too, of course,
viewed the parade, and it was
they who yelled for Wilson and
Gardner, ond not occupants of
the.autoa in the parade, as the
Springfield Leader reported.
The Leader also says there were
only five cars in the parade but
they were evidently unable to
count, as there were twice five,
and then some. The day was
marked by genuine old-time Re
publican enthusiasm, and the
sneakers wer i accorded a close
hearing and frequently applaud
ed. The meeting was presided
over by Joe H Dennis, the intro
ductions being appropriately
made by Col. L. O. Nieder, who
is himself an orator of no mean
ability; Mr. Harrison ably dis
cussed the current issues and
made a good impression on his
hearers by his earnestness and
straightforward talk. He' stated
wliat he would stand for if elect
ed to congress bv the voters of
this district at the November
election. Mr Johnston gave an
interesting talk, with many hu
inorous anecdotes to enliven the
occasion, several prominent tie
publicans occupied seats on the
platform. ' The management of
Crawford's Comedians are. to be
commended for their kindness in
giving the use of their tent for
the Democratic and Republican
speaking.'
' The "Democrats had a banner
across Commercial Street: "Vote
for Wood row Wilson and save the
country," The Republicans put
up one reading "Vote for Hughes
and Fairbanks and restore Pros
Deritv:" also one reading "Hu
ghes Lamm Club."
The Zat Zams, in their knife
thiowing and balancing illusion
acts, drew tremendous ciowds,
and elicited well merited ap
plause on every These free at
tractions were secured by, the
management after theadvertis
ing matter for the fair had been
issued, but when tlie opportuni
ty came to secure the famous Zat
Earn?, tb contract was signed,
the interest their acts attracted
daily was evidence enough that
it was a feature that took with
the people.
'Just to show folks that Mans
field is in the front rank from
an athletic viewpoint, the local
High School basketball t ain de

ic throughout the fair was of an
unusually high order and much
enjoyed by the immense throng
of stock show visitors. They put
in good time and were always
ready to furnish music Mans
field is certainly proud of her
band.
The fair management worked
bard and early and late to make
the fair a success, and all without
one cent of pay. As one farmer
remarked: ''This is the first time
I have worked for the fair, but
now I appreciate what you Mans
field people are doing. I had no
idea there- was so much work
connected witlva fair." And no
one else does,' either, until he is

AN ARMY MAN HERE
Corporal E. W. Jones of
Springfield, Publicity
' Man, a Live Wire
Corporal Edward W. Jo-ies, U.
S. Army, is the name of the
clean cut young man who repre
sented the Army during the fair
last week. He brought there
life to show oeopie that Uncle
Sam's soldier outfit is every whit
as fine ns it, is purported to be.
And if results are proof, he con
vinced His success was two re
cruits and a-number of pros
ixscts. The recruits were U. H.
Grantham of Mansfield, and Joye
Dugau of Manrdieid.
"M r. Jones has enjoyed eleven
years of continuous s-ervice in.
the army and is one of the few
men who have been fortunate
enough to experience duty in
piacti-u)ly all of the important
undertakings of the army during
his career. He served in Cuba
with the Army of Pacification in.
1906 7; was detailed on the Mexi
can border for a time; served in
the Phiiipines from 1911 to 1914;
and in his time has been station
ed at practically all of tlie im
portttnt posts in ihe continental
United States.
Like most all army men, Cor
poral Jones talks, eats and sleeps
sriny. fn the service he is
known as "Pug." He holds a
sharp shooter's medal, and is an
expert on seM-iny; up ex-i cUes
and the rillle butts manual.
Just ut present he is publicity
man for the army recruiting ser
vice in this part of Missoui i,. be

jirig Station, 5i07 College St,
Springfield. It is his intention
to send literature to all eligibles

Thte'rest-yotthg' men in tlie ariujr. ;
Eligible means that young men .
must be sound physically, nor
mal mentally, and have a charac
ter that will piss a thorough
scrutiny. ,
, Mr. Joiies is a native of Da.de- .
ville, Dade. C-.unty, Mo , and is
known by. and acquainted .with
some or the most prominent
people of this vicinity.
The Springfield Leader says:
Cerporal E. V. Joues returned
Saturday night from Manstield
where, he has been .conducting a
campaign at the Mansfield fair
for recruits. The Manstield fair,
Corporal Jones said, was a great
success and several recruits were
secured there.
The Springfield ' papers say
that the Manstield recruits have
been assigned to the Coast Artil
lery Corps and have been sent to
Jefferson B.irracks. We expect
good reMrts from them.
When II. G Cunningham don
ated $1 to the show, he remark
ed that he would get it back as a
premium. He did aud another
$1 with it; he won the $2 premi
um for the best suckling colt.
