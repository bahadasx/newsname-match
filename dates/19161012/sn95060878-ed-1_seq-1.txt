The Festal Savings Bank.
WASHINGTON, D. C.
Oct. 13. Things bumped
along pretty slowly with the
savings banks during the first
year or more, and as a result
the postoffice department
withdrew the system from
many small towns. Its first
success was attained in the
large centers, whose foreign
population had been educated
to its use in their own coun
tries. Residents of interior
places find a good deal of dif
ficulty in reconciling the
placing of their money in the
local postoffice, when they
have full knowledge that it is
to be carried direct to the
home bank and placed on de
posit by the government.
They have argued that if the gov
ernment has such faith in the local
banks, then why should the individual
be so charry about depositing direct
ly with them. The postoffice depart
ment reports an increase of $5,000,
000 in deposits last month. At the
department it was said that the gain
is due to the removal of restrictions
on the amount that may be accepted,
and is also one of the results of na
tion-wide prosperity. The New York
postoffice has more than $20,000,000
on deposit; Brooklyn $6,4G7,000; Chi
cago $4,239,000; Boston $2,300,000;
Detroit $2,127,000.
Work on new coins is being delayed
at the mint because of difficulty with

just as well as the latest models.

"The president says :
I am against a statewide
prohibition unit.
I believe in a smaller local
option unit.
x I believe in home rule.
I shall vote for home rule."
The Detroit Times calls attention
to the above as a sample of the trickily
worded, trickily displayed, dishonest
advertising used by the" liquor inter
est in various states.
The Times says:
"The president of the United States
'says' none of the things the league
has printed 'in bold type in its ad
vertising. "The president of the Home Rule
League says them, as the reader as
certains after he has read far down, in
the smaller type.
"The trick in the ad. makes it a lie
to the people of Michigan and a sland
er upon the president of the United
States."
So unscrupulous has been the
"Home Rule League" of Michigan in
its advertising, that the Port Huron
Times-Herald, which accepts the ad
vertising, has warned its readers in
detail as follows:
"If the Michigan Home Rule League,
which is doing considerable publicity

the roads with running streams, and

a radical change in its advertising. In
a few words it should be honest. It
should not attempt to deceive the pub
lic. And unless it does change it will
not only be barred from the decent
newspapers of the state, but it will
defeat-the very purpose for Av.hich it is
intended.".
In California the wets are printing
advertisements to the effect that
president Wilson is opposed to state
wide prohibition. The president has
issued only one statement in regard
to state-wide prohibition and in this
he favored prohibition for the ' state
of Texas. Many Democrats have felt
that the president should openly re
sent the falsehoods of the liquor inter
ests in various states, but some of his
friends have contended that he should
absolutely keep "hands off" of the pro
hibition question and that it would be
impossible for him to say anything
without having to follow it up.
Reports are also beginning to come
in that Mr. Hughes' name is being
misused in certain sections. Friends
of the 'president and of ?.ir. Hughes
should not be deceived. Neither man
has ever said anything that could be
honestly interpreted as opposition to
the present national and state-wide
prohibition campaigns nor has 'ever
said anything in favor of them.

planned to come in from the country
were prevented. On Friday a day meet

there will be a great many people

Tom Campbell will be the speaker

night.
