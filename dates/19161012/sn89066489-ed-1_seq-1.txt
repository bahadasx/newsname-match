Scores Evading of
Issues.
New York. Oct. 8. The pres
idential campaign lias progressed
to that point where it is now pos
sible to formulate a definite judg
ment as to the trend of sentiment.
The issues have been clearly de
fined, despite the steady attempts
of Mr. Hughes to straddle every
liiestion that concerns patriotic
A in erica us.
Sentiment all over the United
States is crystallizing in favor of
the retention in office of" the.
President who has maintained
peace with honor and whose ad
ministration lias been' marked by
plentitude and contentment.
The alternative for peace with
honor is war. There is no middle
ground. Mr. Hughes attempts to,
straddle the issue, but his chief
spokesman, Col. Roosevelt, boldly
asserts the I'nited States should
have pursued a course in its for
eign relations that would have
plunged us into war with Ger
many.

the issue. It is Wilson, with hon
orable peace and bounteous plen
tittide, vs. Hiifrlies with war and
its aeeouipanyin; desolation.
1 here is an issue-of transcend-
iiif; importance, and it is loyalty
to the Stars and Stripes. Mr.
IIuKbos' mIimu'o can be construed
only as a bid for the support of
the disloyalists, the men who hope
to punish the President of the
I nited States for his course of
strict neutrality in our foreign re
lations by ambiguous utterances.
Mr. Hughes has sought riot to of
fend the disloyalists and at the
same time please the patriotic.
American whose support he needs.
But he cannot esi-apc'the issue of
the consequence of his attitude.
He must tell the American people
under whose flag he is running
for President.
And there is still another reason
why torwanl-lookni" patriotic
Vmericans arc rallying to the
President. And that is the reali
zation that Mr. Hughes - election
means the restoration to power of
Penrose, Crane, Harries, Smoot,
Warren and the other old guard
Republicans.
It is strange that the Republi
cans in their confidence, should
use their biggest oratorical gun
(Roosevelt) in a State (Michigan)
which they claim will give Mr.
Hughes the normal Republican
majority of 2110,000. It looks like
a. wast of ammunition. Rut it
isn't, for the Republicans know,
as reports show, that Michigan to
day is lost to them. New York,
Ohio, Indiana. California, Wash
ington and ather States give ev
ery indication of rolling up splen
did pluralities for the President.
A Day in the Country.
Last Saturday morning Misses
Xadine Holloway, Grace Erwin,
Kthel Major and Ola. Ayres, ac
companied by Miss Hurney Rice
and Miss Rosamond Scroggs as
chaperons, went to the country
on n hike and paw paw hunt.
They arrived at Mr. Wayland 's
3 1-2 miles from town, where they
were joined by Misses Kathleen
Wayland, Helen and Dorothy
Clark. From there they went to
Mr. Wayland 8 timber, where, af
ter they filled their baskets with
paw paws, they enjoyed a lunch.
After spending a pleasant fore
noon in the woods and at Mr.
Wayland 8 they were accom
panied back to town by Ashby
Wayland and Misses Kathleen
Wayland, Helen Clark, and Ruth
Jones on a hay rack. All enjoyed
the day very much.
