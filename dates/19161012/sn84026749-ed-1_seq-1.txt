By H. C. HAMILTON.
BOSTON, Oct. 12. The Bos
ton Red Sox are on the verge of
their fourth world's championship
today. The Brooklyn Dodgers are
on the brink of a baseball eclipse
One more smash at the Dodge,
and they will go down for the
count. They are hanging on th;
ropes now. Just one little shove
will complete the tragedy of "who
put the bush in Flatbush."
Squaring away for today's guire
the fifth of the present series- -the
Red Sox will go tearing in de
termined to clinch the title without
further delay and stow it away for
the second time in as many years.
This being Columbus Day, one
of the biggest crowds of the. title
tussle is expected to be on hand at
Braves' Field, as Boston takes the
accomplishments of Columbus with
much seriousness, and nobody goes
to work.
RED SOX PROVES CLASS.
Tottering on the verge of a crack In
the superb Infield, which has tightened
at every moment In the American
League race, threatened' by the menac

their class.

Police Head, In Annual Report,
Says Restricted Sale Would
Aid Crime Prevention.
Legislation restricting the sale of fire
arms In the District Is urged by Major
Raymond V. Pullman, Superintendent
of Police, In his report for the fiscal
year ended June 30, submitted to the
Commissioners today. In the work ot
crime prevention, he declares, nothing
will help the police department more
than tho enactment of such n law.
"Suggestion is made." says the re
pot t. "thut a law be enacted which
would make It necessary for every per
son to make written application to a
dealer for the purchase of a firearm,
and that delivery not bo made lor ten
days to thirty days, giving the police
drpattineut time to Inquire Into ihc
character of the prospective purchaser
and giving time for tho puichuHer to
lose his lit of passion If he wishes lo
obtain the revolver to harm anyone. In
stead of for the protection of his liome.
"A icccnt picture of every person pur
chasing a firearm or other Weapon
should be furnished the nollce ilemirl-
ment, and legitimate owners of revolv
ers would not bo harmed If a step fur
ther In the law weie taken and ue
name of ever person owning a (Iro.irm
in the District of Columbia weie regis
tered, along with the name and number
of the weapon. Kven such a law would
be for less drastic than the Sulllv.iti
law, which Is operative In New York."
Recommendation Is made that legis
lation be obtained providing for the
annual registration of nulmnoullck.
The members of the department, the
report states, continued to give strict
attention to the enforcement of oil laws
regarding vlue. The work done by tho
vice squad, the major says, has been
broadened and put In charge of a lieu
tenant. The number of arrests made
during the jcar In 'ho enforcement of
the vice laws was SfiS.

PIKEBVILLE, Ky Oct. 12.-ltt.pub-llcan
Candidate Hughes Is dctennlncd
not to make any answer to the charge
that he represents the German-American
vote. We regards himself as poten
tially a President. Ho' holds It his duty
neither by word nor deed to wo Ik Into
uny trap which shall seem to commit
hm, a man who may be chosen In No
vember to dictate America's position to
ward tho world, to any specific course
of action with tegard to Europeun poli
cies. The United Pres presents this expla
nation of the candidate's attitude by
permission today.
When Hughes discusses and condemns
the British blacklist. It Is further ex
plained, It is not with the Idea oT an
animus against Great Uiltain. When
he hits at the submarine warfato and
the Wilson Administration handling of
that Issue lie dors not speak with u
mind biased ngulnst Crummy. He
speaks as one who regards America's
opportunity, as the greatest of neutral
nations, the most momentous to Amer
ica heiself, and to the other nations
of the world In establishing Hi mly the
principles of neutrality.
Must Uphold Dignity.
To those with whom he talked on the
subject, Mr. Hughes lms added to this
statement of position, the following:
America must leave no stone un
turned to enforce against any nation
her rights as a world power. By so
doing, the 1'nlted States not only main
tains her own dignity ns n nation, but
she establishes more firmly the prin
ciples of Justice contained In Interna-

Clarence F. King, piesldent of tho

take up with counsel for tho company
the question of entering court piooved
Ings to test the validity of the onlui.
Notice was given the commission that
In the event the lequest was declined,
the company "would feel obliged io
take steps to appeal,"
The rules were characterized by the
company as "impracticable, unreason
able, uncertain, vague. Indefinite and
incapable of enforcement."
Although piotest ngninst the order
was made t the public hearings by the
Capital Ti action Company, no oppcu
has been filed with the Public I'tlllties
Commission by that company.
It Is understood the company may
take action, but nothing detlnlte coma

The regulations require the street rail

CRITICS OF SPEECH
London Press Declares War
Secretary Voiced Feeling of
Nation In Interview.
Uy ED. L. KEEN.
LONDON. Oct. ll-Llyod-George's
crushing rejoinder to Richard Holt, one
of his critics. In Commons yesterday,
received equal attention from the news
papers today with Premier Asqulth's
statement that there must be no ''pre
ciu'.ous nnd dlshonoilng compromise
masquerading under the name of
peace."
Holt criticized the war secretary's re
cent statement on peace to the United
I'less.
He complained that l.loyd-Georgc
used sporting tonus like the now fam
ous "knockout" expression, that his
statements were1 uncompromising and
that the war minister wus not the
proper person to express the govern
ment's views on foreign policies.
Nation BackH Interview.
Turning directly to Holt, Lloyd
George said.
"What you really object to, Is not tits
manner but the pith and purport ot
this Interview."
Lloyd-George added that he was
simply elaborating what the llrittsh und
French prime mlnlsteis had said and
whsl the cabinet and military advliers
1h'II-vm1. He spoke with linpi cwdve
(iiiphiisls when lie said he wished he
weie at liberty to "tell the honorable
membci how timely the Intci't'low wus
on us appearance."
Tho London pai' purtlcii nrl" em
phasized Lloyd-George's doclcratl n
that th Interview was timely and
seutlal and not meiely a oersonal ex
pression but the opinion of the cabinet,
and war committee, and also of Dug
laud's allies.
Aimed at Intervention.
"IJetwcen these words," said the Dally
Telegraph, icfi-rrlng to the leferunce
to the timeliness of the Interview, "even
the dullest imagination can read. Plain
ly the Interview was expressly timed to
kill an Intended attempt at Intervention,
and It succeeded there' no need to say
whei e."
The goneial Impiesslon was today
that In making this quick retort to his
critics, Lloyd-Geoige effectively scotch
ed a hostile clique, which, though small.
Is somewhat mischievous. At the same
ttmo he thoroughly Justified the pro
priety of cabinet ministers giving In
terviews when tho occasion demands.
Lloyd-George's Raoscveltlan epigram
that an Interview Is "a public report of
n pilvuto conversation" was considered
especially happy.

ENTER CAPITAL
Plans Disclosed At Hearing, of
Alexandrians on Armor
Plate Plant Site.
PRELIMINARY SURVEY MADE
Link to Connect Road With OH
Dominion Railway Would B
Built.
Interests behind the Old Do
minion Railway and the Western
Maryland Railroad have completed
tentative arrangements for con
struction of a connection between
the two roads that will give the
Western Maryland an entry into
Washington.
This fact developed today at a
hearing granted by Secretary of the
Navy Daniels to citizens of Alex
andria, Va., who appeared before
him in behalf of Alexandria as a
site for the proposed Government
armor plate factory.
It was stated at the hearing by
Congressman Carlin of Virginia,
that preliminary surveys for the
connection between the two roads
have been completed. They pro
vide for construction of about
thirty or forty miles of track be
tween the terminus of the- Old, Do
minion at Alexandria and a point
on the Western Maryland north
west of Washington.
CHEAPER COAL PROMISED,
Congressman Carlin disclosed the In
formation for the purpose of showlnt
the advantages which Alexandria n
jo)s from the standpoint of accessi
bility to the coal fields of West Vir
ginia and Pennsylvania.
He declared that the competition of
the connection between the two roads
would make It possible to lay COl
down in Alexandria at from I to 10
cents a ton cheaper than the price at
Philadelphia, which Is being favorably
considered as a site for the proposed
Government plant.
It la understood that If the connec
tion were completed the Western
Maryland would be able to. obtain
privileges under which It would be
possible to operate a passenger serv
ice from Union Station in this city,
uslntf the tracks which now carry
the trains ot the Southern, the
Chesapeake ' & Ohio, Norfolk and
Western and Richmond-Washington
line across into Alexandria from
Washington.
Congressman Carlin went so far a
to declare that If the Government
would agree to locate the armor
plant factory at Alexandria, the cltl
zeni and municipal authorities of that
city would be In position to guaran
tee the construction of the physical
connection between the two roads.
Tho Old Dominion railway Is con
trolled largely by the McLean Inter
ests In this city, while the Wetter.
Maryland in under the domination pi
the Rockefellers. It Is stated that a
tentative agreement looking to th
Joining ot the two roads was reached
some time ago.
Offers Site Free.
In addition to this Inducement.
Congresmnn Carlin offered on behalf
of tho city of Alexandria to present
tho Government, free of all costs, with
a site of between eighty and 100
iicros on the water front for the pro
posed plant.
With Mr. Carlin were officials nf
tho city of Alexandria, of tho Cham
ber of Commerce and Hoard of Trade
and of tho Retail .Merchants' Associa
tion o fthat city. An eight-page brief
presenting torse and convincing ar-u-

ton, of Alexandria, made a brief "d

of this committee: It. E. Knight, J.
T. Preston, C. II, Livingstone, W. D.
Bmineit, and J. V. Davis. Mayor
Thomas A. Fisher was unable to be
prosent.
From the standpoint of military
safc. Mi. Curlln called attention to
tho fuct that Alexandria la located
oighty miles from the mouth of tht
Potomao river, which Is guarded by
two forts and which, by reason of Its
narrow channel could be protected easily
by mines.
The proximity of the Indian Head
proving grounds. Immediately across
tho river, he said, would enable the
Government to save 75 per cent of the
present cost of transporting armor from
tho private plants to the testing
grounds.
Iubor, he contended, could be ob
tained easily, and with the cost of liv
ing cheaper at Alexandria than else
where, the labor obtained would ba
cheaper than elsewhere. .
