1 Fierce Fighting Keeps
tip in Italian Drive
Toward City of Triest
General Cadorna's reported success
in the breaking of the Austrian line
at several points southeast of Gori
zla in the sudden renewal of the
Italian drive toward Triest, is de
clared by entente correspondents at
the front to have been effected In the
face of strengthened Austrian lines, to
which fresh troops recently were sent.
Vienna, in its latest statement,
claims that the Italians havo been
driven out of many trenches they
had penetrated and that fighting is
being continued for possession of
others. The Austrians took 1400 men
of the attacking forces. Rome has re
ported the capture of nioro than 5000
prisoners in the course of the ad
vance. Greek Yields to Entente.
Latest reports on the situation in
Greece are that the Greek authorities
have yielded to the entente demands
for the turning over of virtually the
entire Greek navy and the dismantl
ing, or surrender of forts on the sea
coast. Control by the entente of all
material of all railroads, all mails
) and telegraph sen-ice, so as to render
impossible its use to the detriment of
the entente forces, is reported to have
been included in tho demands.
A lull again seems to 'have set in
' along the Somme front in northern
France following the heavy fighting
of the last day or two. London re
ports that no Incidents of moment oc
curred last night.
London, October 12. An uneventful
night along tho British lines In the
Sorame region is reported in today's
official Avar statement It follows:
"South of tho Ancre there is noth
i ing to report During tho night five
raids were undertaken by us in the
i Mcssines, Bois Grenicr and Haisnes
i areas in the course of which we took
prisoners and inflicted casualties on
tho enemy."

ITALIAN BATTLE
I fM IE
All Calibers of Guns Engage in
Grand Concert Against
j Austrians
FIRE GROWS INTENSE
Enemy Goes Down Every-
where Thousand Prisoners
Taken Defenders
j Reinforced.
Paris, Oct. 12. 1C a. m The follow
ing description of the recent Italian
success on the Carson has been tele
graphed to the Petit Parlsien by Its
war correspondent on tho Italian
front as follows:
! Our artillery began to concontrato its
fore on the morning of the eighth
I on the zone between Vertolba and the
i sea, favored intermittently by the
sun. All calibers engaged in a grand
r concert and their tiro swept the Aus-
Wan position yard by yard, growing
I gradually more Intense.
"On the next day, the ninth, the
' bombardment continued unabated. Pa
: trols which were sent out to recon
noltcr reported splendid results, par
! Hcularly where the Austrians were
most strongly established In tho
space between Oppacchiasella and
jfc Hill 77, cast of Monfalcone. Hero the
l Austrian line was tho strongest, Thoy
used tho walls of gardens, copings of
wells of gardens, copings of wells and
! natural caverns of rock. The line do
t scends from Hill 20S to the north as
far as a mile east of tho road from
Oppacchiasella to Jamlano. Tho ene
my had made several series of
trenches facing In every direction
which made tho defense of the posi
tion easy. Two of the most impor
tant positions were tho triangular re
doubt and. another position called
Fortlno which were furnished with
machine guns and protected by form
idable artillery. It was against this
Part of tho front that the Italian ar-
tlllery was directed yesterday with
magnificent results.
Fantastic Scene.
f Tho correspondent adds: "I fol
f lowed tho battle yesterday morning
from a central point between No
vavas and Villanova. It was a iantas
tic sight. Tho Austrian trenches
were converted into a heap of rub
blo by tho big guns which shot col-
r
umns of' smoke and dust 300 feet in
the air.
"At 1:30 p. m. reports came that
though tho trenches and barbed wire
entanglements had been wiped out
the enemy wore hidden in caves
awaiting the infantry attack. The ar
tillery opened afresh on the Austrian
second and third lylnes the bombard
ment reached -its climax at 1:30. A
colleague, who was present in sever
al wars, declared he had never seen
such a spectacle of destruction.
"The infantry attacked at 2:50 p.m.
with splendid dash and the triangular
redoubt and Fortino fell after a des
perato struggle. The enemy went
down everywhere before the Italians,
nothstanding a stubborn resistance.
After a few hours fighting at No
vavas a thousand prisoners were tak
en among whom 17 Austrian nation
alities were represented We ob
tained proof that far from withdraw
ing troops the Austrians had several
fresh battalions to reinforce the de
fenders of the Carso."
