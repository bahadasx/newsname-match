Some Inside History of Shady
Character About
the Campaign.
NEW YORK, N. Y. Oct. 12.?In a
signed statement today Victor Ridder
of the Now York Staatz Zeiting denied
absolutely the story made public by
Norman Hapgood, of the Wilson Independent
League, to the effect that
Mr. llidder had told State Senator Kellor
of Illinois that be had written a
campaign speech ' for Mr. Hughes In
which Mr. Hughes would attack England
in order to hold the German vote.
Mr. Ridder says there was a meeting
between himself and Senator Kellor.
but that knowing Mr. Kellor, he had
witnesses present and he has the written
statement of one of these witnesses,
Henry Abeles of New York that no
such remarks as are credited Jo him
by Kellor and Hapgood were ever
made.
Instead Kellor was endeavoring to
persuade Mr. Ridder to call on Presi
dent Wilson at tlie White House, and
assured Mr. Ridder that Mr. Wilson
"can convince you In the course of an
hour or two, that he is friendly to Germany."
Mr. Fthlder declares that Mr.
Kellor "for his own purposes wilfully
placed words in my mouth which were
never spoken."
Having disposed of this canard Mr.
Ridder goes 06 to make some extremely
interesting disclosures concerning
tho efforts of the Wilson administration
to Curry favor secretly with the
German American voters whom Mr.
Wilson publicly brands as dlBloyal. He
says that "Mr. Abeles happened to be
present at the meeting with Mr. Kellor,
having called as the bearer of an
invitation from Senator Stone, chairman
of the foreign relations committee
of the Senate, to discuss the questions
of the campaign at a gathering
of Influential German Apirelcans to be
arranged at Terrace Garden that very
evening.
"I declined the invitation, Mr. Abeles
immediately called up Senator
Stone from the Staatz Zeltung office
and told him tbat I had declined Senator
Stone then spoke to me saying
that he would regard it as a personal
favor not only to come myself but also
to oring innuentiai Herman Americans
with me. Under the circumstances
I feel that we should at least hear
what Senator Stone had to say and so
a number of us gathered at Terrace
Garden for dinner at 8 o'clock on September
16 as the guest of Mr. Abeles.
Senator Stone used all his well known
powers of persuasion, and I am ready
to concede him the palm as an able
advocate of the administration, to
convince us that the apparent anti
German-American policies of the Wilson
administration were only for public
consumption and that privately
they were ready to work hand In glove
with the ' German-American leaders.
The whole object of this conference bo
far as Senator Stone was concerned
was to And out what action was necessary
on the part of the administration
In order to secure the support of German-Americans
at the coming erection.
Can anything be more humiliating
than the spectacle of-the chairman ot
the Foreign Relations Committee of
the senate gumshoeing in a small room
of a third avenue beer garden and bar

TYPE HOME IN

Plans for what will be one of the
most attractive residences In the Fairmont
suburbs were submitted to pros- :
poctlve bidders today. These are for
the new home to be built on Peacock |

The house will be the first example

England type of colonial country home.
The young firm of Jones and Nuzum,
who have also designed many of the
popular English rural type cottages
In that section of the city; one of the
most striking of which Is the new
residence of John Gordon Smythe in
the West End addition, are the archltects
of this home. The architects ,
have also planned a beautiful landscape

harmonize with the house. ;
The two-story and attic house paint- ,
ed colonial white with a green slate i
roof and green shutters; containing ,
six rooms, service quarters and ser- ]
vice kitchen wing; will when complet- ;
ed occupy the site where the Vender- ,
vort house formerly stood, across the
farm driveway, opposite the Sands t
home. Back of the new residence is
to be a formal garden while on either
side wide lawns fringed with shrub- ,
