. Capper Didn't Veto These ""
Arthur Capper hasn't been a
success as governor of Kansas, j
He just hasn't made good his
promises, and has begun to real-
' ize it. Realizing he hasn't kept
. faith with the men and women
of the state, he is looking for an
alibi and is trying to blame his
' failures on a Democrat or two
who happen to be in office.
However in the -approving of
salaries Capper forgot about his
veto, and preferred to let the or
phans at Atchison go without
proper facilities and to make the
insane sleep on the floor or put
' them into over-crowded dormi
tories rather than let a few Re-
publican office holders go with
out a raise in salary. Here are
some of the raises in salary that
Cappen could have vetoed but he
- didn't. He approved them all:
The State Superintendent's sal
ary was raised from $2,500 to
$3,000. The assistant from $1,
600 to $2,400.
In the Secretary of State's of
fice, the filing clerk was raised
from $900 to $1,200.
.In the Treasurer's office the
bookkeeper was raised from $1,
200 to $1,400. ,
In the Attorney General's of
fice, the filing clerk was raised
from $900 to $1,000.
In the Adjutant General's of
fice, the Adjutant General was
raised from $2,000 to $2,500. The

on bis. way to his work on a
school house south of Meade,
but his progress was retarded
somewhere near Geo Borgcr s
place, where the car was over
turned, and Mr. Byrn was
caught beneath it. Here be
was compelled to, remain for
nearly an hour, when he was re
leased by the occupants of a
passing car., Hisvstay beneath
the Ford was made more un
pleasant by a thorough soaking
with the entire contents of the
gasoline tank. No bones were
broken, and aside from being a
little stiff, he is able to be abou-t,
and we are triad to relate, as
lively as ever.

I Am An American
SON OK CIVIL WAR VETKKAN, IN VIVID PKOSE
POEM, SUMMONS ALL WHO 1X)VK AMERICA
TO VOTE FOH WILSON
I am an American. J hate war and I love peace
and honor. My father fought in in the Civil war
for the cause he thought was right.
He died fin the battlefield of Gettysburg.
, - He left a widow and five small childron.
As- a child at my mother's knee, I have heard
her, as the tears stole down her checks, describe
the horrors and the miseries of the days of '61.
I have read the words of Sherman who said
"War is hell." '
I try to picture the Borrow and woe of those
'stirring times and Iisee destruction and death in
every city and state. ,
I hear the shrieks ot mothers, the walls of sor
rowing wives whom relentless Death made widows; j
the cries of children waiting in vain the return of
"Daddy." - '
J see. a land once rich in grain become more
devastated than it it were visited by the seven
plagues of Egypt; a land once peaceful and pros
perous, the most misterable country that the sun
ever shone upon. I HAVE EVERY REASON TO
HATE WAR.
.-', '
My mind' eye sees the terrific struggle now be
ing waged in Europe For what, Who Can Answer?
I tremble like all true Americans at the
thought of our land being engulfed in this madden
ing sea of slaughter.
I know our President has kept us out of this
awful war and I lift my voice both day and night In -grateful
accents to Heaven for having raised up at.
this crucial period Woodrow Wilson who, like
Washington and Lincoln, has been the savior of
America. -- " ' x '
I know that Wilson has preserved unsullied the
glory of Columbia that he has maintained peace
without sacrificing honor.
No stain of shame has ever yet besmirched the
pages of our history, nor has our flag ever trailed ,
oeuiud the war chariot of king or emperor; and I
know that while Woodrow Wilson rules the coun
try, this boast will probably ring o'er hill and vale
with no fear of a discordant echo.
I know thatWilson has endeavored , in every
honorable way to preserve neutrality with foreign
ppwers, and tnat his policies and actions have been,
criticised by men who, like Caesar,, would sacrifice
country for ambition.
I know men. 1 know that Christ himself was
cruciiied by his own ciioscn people because he tried
to save them. - " '
1 know that Wilson is sorely pressed and in thi
hour of dire neea asks true Americans, to help him
tight the taoial battles of Amwioa. ..AND THIS 1
NHAiJi DO.
My country's flag waves from no loiuly castle
' but nines its folds to the breeze of freeiioui the
proud emblem of the greatest nation the world haa
ever known.
THEREFORE '
I want no change of administration at this hour
of terrible uncertainty. 1 care not whether Wilson
is a Republican or a Democratic leader.
He iias gone through the crucible of criticism
and slander and ha3 come forth ladluut like a mass
' of molten gold.
1 know that on his shoulders rests a govern
ment dearer to him than life itself. .
I know that at its integrity thousands of peo
ple at home are striking, while at it foreign eyes.are
glaring, ad 1 know that Wilson has never faltered.
This ordeal with its attending sorrow and Sad
ness occasioned by the ingratitude of some may
have aged him, but it has added beauty and sublimi
ty to his" character and has not only Humanized ev
ery instinct but has expanded and elevated him to
the heights. where the venomed darts of slander
can not wound him.
I believe in the words of tlienbct: "Great men
grow greater by the lapse of time; we know those
least whom we have Sisen Jhe latest; and they
'mongst those who have grown sublime who
fought for Human Liberty are Greatest."
The man who has stood at the helm of state
and has piloted ua through the channel of danger
out Into the calm waters of peace, contentment and
prosperity THAT MAN 1 SHALL STAND ISY.
That man is Woodrow Wilson.
1 shall vote for him because 1 AM AN AMERICAN.

Allen to Lansing
On Saturday, October, 7tb,
the Supreme Court affirmed the
decision of the lower Court in
the Allen case, and as soon as
county attorney Sullivan was ad
vised of this fact by wire, he
caused a committment to be is
sued and Allen was taken into
custody. His attorneys made
strenuous efforts to secure his
release, arguing that the com
mittment was prematurely is
sued, but without avail. The of
ficial Mandate was received from
the Suprerce Court to day, and
Sheriff Krisle will leave with
Allen for the penitentiary at
Lansing,' this evening, (Thurs
day.)
Thus closes the chapter, and
those who predicted that Allen
would never be convicted, or, be
ing convicted, would never go to
the pen, are entitled to another
guess.

Cities Gain, Country Loses
The figures of ' the . Kansas
State Tax Commission for 1915
show that while during the pre
vious 12-month period real es
tate values in the cities of Kan
nna inrrpaRpA nearlv six million
dollars, farm land-values in the
state of Kansas during the same
period decreased a little more
than six hundred and thirty
thousand dollars. City values in
creasing farm values decreas
ing. A survey made recently by
the Missouri State University,
covering 650 farms, showed
farm land in two miles of a good
town, worth $78 an acre; in four
miles, $70; in six miles, $60; in
eight miles, $58; and farms a
greater distance from a good
tnwn ran down to $55 an acre.
.These figures show that location
has something to do with larm
land values. A farm near a good
town has greater value; farther
away, less value. A farm near
a dead town may possess no
greater value than a farm a long'
way from a good town. Move a
farm away from a good town, its
value shrinks. Kill the town, the
same thing happens to the farm
its value ahVinks. The farm
has been removed. It is not near
a good town. -The people of Kan
sas are sending out of the state
20 million dollars a year to buv
at retail goods which could be
bought at a fair price in the
state. Loss of business will kill
a town. When a town dies, it
loses in population. Two hundred
and ninety-four Kansas towns
and villages lost in population
during a 12 month period ending
1915. When a town loses businss
and population the farms around
that town are pretty likely to
shrink a little in value. The de-'
mand for these farms is not so
great. Men like to buy land near
a. good town not near a dead
one. Real estate in the larger
cities of Kansas is increasing in
value because these cities are in
creasing in population and they
are increasing in population be
cause they are doing more busi
ness. Many Kansas country
towns are losing in population
because they are doing less busi
ness. ' Business they should be
doing is going to large cities out
side our own state. And the
Kansas community builder
should not forget that location
has something to do with land
values. .
