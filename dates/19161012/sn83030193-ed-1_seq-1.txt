Then the law Intervened. Hoard of

"So I understand," replied the
Judge. "I have had your case thor

Probation Officer Irving Halperln
reported that since Schnur was forced
to discontinue his work thruo more
children hod been born to tho couple.
The youngest Is ten months old, the
eldest eleven years. Charity of tho

forbidding clergymen to solomnlze a

recommended In tho report of tho
Joint Commission on Legislation on

Tho commission recommended,
however, that where It Is shown a

arising before marriage, such a de
cree, "being In fact a decree of an
nulment," Is no bar to marriage.
A minister Is now permitted to per
form the ceremony In the case of
the marriage of tho Innocent party to
a divorce, providing tho clergyman
has received thu consent of his

The committee pointed out that the
whole subject of marriage, ''with Its
responsibilities and obligations, should
be muds a matter for careful Inves
ligation by the clergy much more
frequently than Is now common.
