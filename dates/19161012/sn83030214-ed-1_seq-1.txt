BURGLAR IN HOME
AWAITS WOMAN
Holds Gun on Visitors for Hours
?Flees with Loot.
When Mrs. Kugene Sennett, of W71
Ieland Avenue, The Bronx, returned
from the theatre rarly yesterday
morning with her mother, Mrs. F. J,
Bwaoaoy, she found a well dressed
burglar wearing a silk handkerchief
ma.-k waiting for her.
For three hours he had sat in a
chair alternately drinking some of
I Mr. Sennett's liquor and smoking his
! cigarettes, while he kept Mr. and
I Mrs. Thomas Hoffmire, who were
j suying with the young Sennett chil
cr<n, covered with a revolver.
The intruder compelled Mrs. Sen
nrtt to turn over $2,000 worth of jew
! elrv and $20 in money and accom
; plishea the theft so quietly Mrs.
I Sweeney did not know of his pres
i enre in the house until after he had
1 a anished.
MYSTERY WOMAN
ENDS LIFE BY GAS
"Coroner, Don't Fuss," She
Writes ? Monogram
Identity Clew.
She received no mail. entertained no
viiitors, made no acquaintances and
never used the telephone. She asked
no questions and answered none. She
was past fifty and lived alone. In her
little three-room furnished apartment
I on the fifth and top floor at 74 West
101st Street Mrs. Holmes -first name
Minerva, it was learned after her death
?bore the neighborhood name of the
"woman of mystery."
She did not work, yet always was lib
erally supplied with money. Her
j clothes were the finest. She made her
purchases on Fifth Avenue and carried
her packages home. No one save the
occupant set foot over thc threshold of
her three small rooms during the year
1 she lived there until last night.
Agent Discovers Traged*.
About 8 o'clock Urias rVittera, agent
! for the building, who lives on the first
floor, ventured in with his pass key.
He found Mrs. Holmes srated [fl a roek
ing chair in the tiny kitchen. Her gold
rimmed readiag spectacles were on her
nose. Oac hand, dropped to her side,
? held a newspaper. She had not moved
? since she had taken her position beside
the gas stove on Saturday last. She
did not appear to bc dead but she was.
The quarter ifl the ga BB81 r had
done exartly what wns expected of it.
Witters calied Policeman Pryor. The
' patrolman summoned dctec lves and a
' physician. TTie latter aaid Mrs. Holmes
, had been dead severai days, and the
! forrner commenced askin? Wi'ters
j questions of the dead woniin.

The landlord's agent r-peated the
' neighborhood goaaip, coupled with his
1 otMi observations.
"She w?j a woman of education and
, refinement." he said, "and e-uhrr out of
place in the*e little rooms."
The detectives waved the _gen? aside
i and began an -tispect ion of the apart
j ment. But Mra. Holmes appears to
have antieipated them. \fer costly
i clothes had been carefully packed ifl
litcaae. anrl two poflteboardhoaas.
These were found ifl the dming room.
On the diaing*rOOBI table wire two

Faris, Oct 11. Dr. Menard, of the

the Legion of Honor to-day as a reconi

cxposure to the X-ray in hospital work.
Dr. Menard, who has lo t a finger
from each hand, has accomplished ad
mirable results in the location of pro

diers. The loss of his tirst finger did
not deter him from following up his

room. In the loss of hi-' finger he
learned that tissue cells exposed to the
action of the X-ray are sibjected to a
localized disease of nutntion, and, in
consequence,harden and rapidly dead.n.

GERARDBEARS
NO WARNINGS,
HE DECLARES
Denies He Comes to
Report U-Boat
Danger.
The purpose of Ambassador Jamea
W. Cerard's visit to the United States
became more obscure yesterday when
he stated that he had not come from
Berlin to warn rresident Wilson of
? (jermany's intention to resume illcgal
labaiariaa attacks.
The Ambsssador's statement -the
! first he had made for quotation since
he touched American soil is opposed,
, in spirit at least, to a dispatch Mon?
day night from one of Mr. (ierard's
fellow passengers on the Freder.k VIII.
He had evidently talked with Mr. Gerard
and stated that the Ambassador's mis- j
sion was to present information of
Germany's plan to resume U-boat prac
tices objected to by this country.
Ilvades Direct (jucstlon.
"Is your statement this afternoon a
repudiation of the Monday dispatch?"
Mr. Gerard wa.s asked.
"Vou will notice I was not quoted
in that report," he returned.
"Were the statements made in the
Monday dispatch correct or incorrect?"
"I cannot bfl held responsible for in
ferences drawn by a correspondent
during hia visit in Germany."
This is the Ambassador's statement:
"You say it is not true that I came
home at this time to serve notice on
the President of Germany's intention
to repudiate her pledges regsrding the
cor.duct of submarine warfare. Nor
have I returned to report that Germany
j is contemplating the resumption of
submarine attacks upon all neutral
shipping.
"1 .-ay again what I said to a report
j er from the 'Berliner Tageblatt' at
Copenhagen before I aaiied: I should
not think of leaving my post at Ber?
lin at this time if I were not eonvinced
that thc relations between my country
and Germany were as friendly as they
could be, and gave every promise of
; continuing so indetinitcly."
Will See Wilson Soon.
Mr. Gerard will see President Wli
aon early ne\t wtiek. He asserted he
; hi>d no idea when he would return to
Berlin. and, whefl asked to reconcile
lUtement* that he would atart baek
: in a fortnight and that he would re
; mi.in at lealt three months, hc re
plii d:
"I believe my personal business
' will keep me here longer than I at
! tirst expecti-ii."
The ambassador spent a busy dav
reaterday. In the morning he called
en Count von BernstorfT. the German
Ambassador tfl America, but both he
and tba eoonl deaied tbat the call had
any political -igniticancc. They are
old friends, the rount stated, and
thiv talked o-nly of nuitual frienda.

WILSON'S MEN
WOOGERMANS,
RIDDER SAYS
Stone Worked in Beer
Garden?Burleson
Here, Too.
Charges that authorized agents of
President Wilson had tried to conciliatc
German-Americans by asauring them
that the President "is friendly to the
Germans" were made yesterday by Vic?
tor Kidder.
The assertions were made in reply ta
Norman Hapgood's charges, which were
given wide publicity through Demo?
cratic National Headquarter = , that
Charlea E. Hughes had a tacit under
standing with German propagandists.
Mr. Hapgood hasci h:s charges on an
alleged conversation between Ridder,
who is editor of the ".Staats-Zeitung,"
and State Senator Kent V. Keller, of
Ava. 111., which Keller wrote out for
Mr. Hapgood and the latter gave to the
newspaper?.
Mr. Ridder issued his statement
through Republican National Headquar?
ters, not on'y denying the Hapgood
story, but also telling in detail of re
peated efforts by Senator William J.
Stone, of Missouri, chairman of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,
and Postmaster General Burleson to
placate the German-Americans. Mr.
Ridder told of an invitation from Mr.
Keller to visit the White House, "so
that the President can convince you in
an hour or two that he is friendly to
the Germans."
All-N'ight L'ffort by Stone.
The German editor descnbed an all
night conference at the invitation of
Senator Stone at Terrace Garden on
September 16, which was attended by
severai prominent German-Americans,
including Otto Van Schenck, Henry
Abelcs, Jaaeph Frey, presiJent of the
German-Amencan Catholic Societies,
and President Collmeyer of the United
German Turt.ers.
"This conference lasted from I o'clock
at night until 3 on Sunday morning,"
.-aid Mr. Ridder. "Senator Stone used
all his well known powers of persuasion
to convince us that the apparent anti
German-American policies of the Wil?
son administration were only for public
consumption, and that privately they
were ready to work with the German
American leaders. Thc whdle object of
this conference, so far as Senator Stone
was concerned, was to find cut what
action was necessary on the part of thc '
Administration to secure the support
of the German-Americans at the com?
ing election.
"Can anything be more humiliating
than the spectacle of the chairman of
tiie Foreign Relatiofla Committee of
the Senate gumshoeing in a small p.om
of a Third Avenue beer garden Bfld I'ar
fering for the rotfl. whieh the Presi?
dent from the platform of Shadow
LaWB and in his speech of aeccptflflce
had repudiated ?"
Refuse lo See Burleson.
Matters were left ifl a itatfl af
"watehful waiting" at the Terrace
Garden conference, Mr. Ridder aaid,
and hardly ten days pa.-sed before the
Second rmissary of President Wilson,
Postmaster C'-neral Burleson, ap?
peared. Invitations were sent to the
same greup hy Cr*orge Syln
Viereck, editor of "Tiie l-'a' herland."
to meet Mr. Burleaoa ia tha oflice af
Rudolph Pagaaatechar, in the Fortv*
leCOfld Street Building, convenient to
the headquarters of the Democratic
Nr.tional Committee, tn the same
building. Mr. Ridder said all the
other German Americans declined, and
Mr. Viereck met the Postmaster Gen
eral alone.
Bernard H. Ridder, brother of Vio>
tor, calied on Chairman William R.
Willcox, of the Republican National
Committee, with his brother's signed
? itement The chairman turned la
Mr. Ridder iti the presence of the
newspaper men and aahad him:
"Hara I. Bl any representativc of
thc national committee, or has the
candidate, marie any promise or re
quest of you or your brother regard?
ing this campaign?"
Mr. Ridder answered positively in
the negative.
Made Xo Request..
"Have you or your brother con
veyed to Mr. Hughes, dirertly or in
directljr, any ..lea as to what you
woold like to have him say la this
gn V
"U'e poaithrelf hara not."
Mr. Hapgood, in his statement charg
ing Mr. Hughes with an agreement
with the German propairandists, de?
clared that Victor Ridder had told Kel
ler that he, Kidder, had assisted ln
writing a speech in which Mr. Hughes
would clearly announce his attitude
toward the German-Americans. Mr.
Hapgood pointed to the speech Ifl

he would not permit improper later

[From i SuS ConrtlMndtnt of Tht Trlburi* 1
Charleston, W. Va., Oct 11.?Persist.
ent efforta hav* been made since the
nomination of Charlea E. Hughes to
jockey him into an embarrassing posi?
tion on the violation of American righta'
in the course of the European war. His
policy on this important issue can be
stated with authority by The Tribune
correspondent in exposition of the fol?
lowing declaration by Mr. Hughee in
his speech to-day at Parkersburg:
"I stand for the development of the
American nation aceording to th*
genius of its institutions, for the honor
of our country in ihe protection of
AtBerieaa citizens, and, with respect to
every American right on land and sea,
for its firm enforcement.
"We are before the world a great
neutral nation, to vindicate the integ
rity of international law and the r-ghts
of neutrals. And I stand unflinchingly
for the maintenance of the rights of
American citi/.ens 4vith respect to life,
property and commerce.'
Answers All Arguments.
This broad, general statement can
bfl applied ifl reply to all the argu
ments with 44hich Democratic cam
paigaarfl have ffooded the country :n i
the last two months. It contains Mr.
Hflghflfl. own attitude toward the bel- |

He has in mind every violation of
neutral rights by any of the Europerin
belligerent*. Ho has not made and
arill not make in this campaign anv
denunciations of Germany, Lnglmd,

He ha-- not and will not lend himself
to any attempt to draw the ments of

Presidentifll eamaaigfl. He will not

effort I- tight out the war in the
(Jnited State.
This is an American campaign.
There are groat national problems to
be solved. American issues ara at
stake m the Inited States and not war
sympatnies. Mr. Hughes refuses to be
drawn into any alignment of European
sympathies.
Would Ald All Neutrals.
He. speaks exelusively of "American
righ's" and their maintenance because
he believes tha' by a tirm protection
of Vri.-rican rights with respect to
lis/es, property and commerce the
United States can best vindicate the
integnty of interr ational law and
thcreby aafegaard tne similar nght.s of
other neutrals.
Mr. Hughes believe* bll policy is
elear before tho American people,
whatever their Bympathies may ba

Those facts can be regarded as an

"The council's chief functions are:
"1. The coordination of all forms of
transportation and the development of
means of transportation to meet the
military, industrial and commercial
needs of the nation.
"2. The exten.ion of the industrial
mobilization work of the Committee on
Industrial Preparedness of the Naval
Consulting Board. Complete informa?

and producing facilitiea adaptable to
many sided use. of modern warfare
will be procured, analyzed and made

Object of the Council.
"One of the object. of the council
will be to inform Ameriean manufact?
urers as to the part which they can
and must play in national emergency.
"The personnel of the council's ad?
visory members, appointed without re?
gard to party, marks the entrance of
the non-partisan engineer and profes
sional man into Ameriean governmental
affairs on a wider scale tnan ever be?
fore. It is responsive to the increased
demand for and need of business or?
ganization in public matters, and for
the presence there of the best special
lsts in their respective fields."
ASQUITH OPPOSES
'PATCHED PEACE'
Allies Not Selfish, but Will
Require Security for
Future, He Says.
London, Oct 11.?"This war cannot
be allowed to end in aome patched-up,
precariou. and dishonoring compromise,
: maiquerading under the name of peaee."
Premier Asquith made this declara
' tion in the Hou.e of Common. to-night
at the conclusion of a long review ot
the military, financial and economic
situation of Great Britain. It wa. the
Premier'. fir.t public appearance .inc.
the death of his eldest son at the front.
In everything he ?.id he hit straight
from the shoulder, with no quibbling,
and hi. brilliant peroration won for
him th. heartfelt applau.e of every
member of the House, regardless of
party. Undoubtedly he voiced the fecl
ings of a great majority of hi. country
men regarding peaee.
"The Allies are not .elfish, they are
not rindictive," the Premier declared,
"but they require adequat. reparation
for the pas*. and adequnte security for
the future. We owe it to those who
have given their lives that their su
preme sacrilices shall not have been un
uvailing."
Lloyd George Crltlclsed.
Lloyd George's recent assertion. that
Great Britain would tolerate no outside
interference in the direction of peaee
were severely criticised in the course
of a discussion following the Premier'.
speech.
"If the government block. mediation,
how are the Allies to dkcover tier
many'i terms of peaee?" dimandfld
Charles P. Trevelyan. forrner Parlia
mentary Secretary for Kducation. "We
are ignor.nt of the rommitments of the
Allies on the question of annexation of
territory. Must we continue the war
1 until Russia is in possession of Con
stantinople?"
Mr. Trevelyan also eomplained that
the government had ignored the lm
' portant speech of President Wilson on
international mediation. Replying to
this, Lloyd George said that Viscount
Grap had anticipated President Wil?
son's statement.
To the other criticisms the War Min?
ister rep'r.cd that the question of medi?
ation was military rather than diplo
! matic. Intervention now, he poin'.-d
out. would be a military triumph for
Germany and a military disastcr for
Britain. This opinion was held, he de?
clared, by the Cabinet, the war com?
mittee and the military advuers of
I every ally.
War Review by Premier.
Premier Asquith referred to the
complete coordination of the general
staffs of the four great power*. and to
vmpathy and interest with which
Great Britain is abeerriaf the courage,
tenacity and strateg'.cal .kill displayed
by Italy and Kuss.a in the more dis
tant fields. He syoke appreciatively of
the part played by Serbia and Belgium
and "la.tly "by Rumania. whoge people
and King, ln dertanco of a thou.and
call. to neutrality, joined our cause.
"I wi.h I could ?dd Graece, with her
imperishable record of resistance
against the onrush of barbansm and
tyranny," he eontinued. "Kven now
? ireece, t isely guided and wisely gov
? rned, might take a worthy part on the
side t,i .vhich she is committed by
great .nd glorious traditions."
Surreripg the progreis of the war

Premier said hot weather had hampen J
