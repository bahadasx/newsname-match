CAMPAIGN ON FOR
LARGER HOSPITAL
FORCES ORGANIZING FOR SYS
TEMATIC EFFORT TO MEET
GREAT LOCAL NEED
Williston has excellent prospects
for Meoring a modern hospital suit
able to meet its great ana growing
need of such an institution.
Preliminary work is now being done
for a short term campaign under the
leadership of an eminently success
fid director Elizabeth Rudyerd Cur
rier, who recently completed a cam
paign for Marquette University, Mil
waukee, where she raised over
$500,000. The publicity is in charge
of Everett R. Currier, for many
years manager of The Publicity
Printing Department for the Ladies
Home Journal and the Saturday
Evening Post. Joseph W. Jackson,
President of the Williston Commercial
Club, has accepted the post of Chair
man of the campaign.
Offices have been opened at 13 2d
Street West, first door west of the
First National Bank, Telephone 33.
Miss Constance S. Patton of New
York, who has been closely associated
with Mrs. Currier for years in her
fund raising work, is directing the
campaign orior to the arrival of Mr.
and Mrs. Currier.
A Case of Great Need
In speaking of the local situation
Miss Patton makes a strong argu
ment preliminary to the campaign.
"Five years ago there was opened
at the corner of 4th Street and 1st
Ave. West in Williston, a small hos
pital known as "Wittenberg Hospi
tal." The building was a residence
house, not built for hospital purposes.
For this reason it was serviceable but
not up-to-date in every particular as
a "modern hospital. However, the doc
tors and general public welcomed the
opening of this hospital because it of
fered the only place where patients
could be taken in au& given surgical
treatment and medical care.
"During these five years the people
of Williston and the surrounding dis
tricts have continuously benefitted
from the Wittenberg Hospital. So
that now at the point where its use
fulness has crowded it so that suffer
ers have actually to be turned away,
it comes to you, citizens of Williston
and surrounding towns, and asks you
to provide the funds for a new up-to
date building with modern equipment
a building which will be a decoration
to your city, a monument to your gen
erosity and a blessing to suffering
humanity.
"Why should the people of Willis
ton send their sufferers to Minne
apolis? Why should a man, tortured
with pain, nave to endure a seven
hundred mile trip on a jarring train
Why should he take the risk of de
ferring an operation eighteen hours,
when often a wait of much fewer
hours than that spells death Why
When Williston has skilled surgeons
and public spirited citizens right here
at home? Ask yourself that question
and you will wonder why Williston
has not long ago had a hospital on
a par with its imposing school, its
post office, its Library, its Elks Home
and its Armory.
"A good hospital i£ a blessing to its
community. It is a life saving insti
tution. Sooner or later it touches
every family. No home is exempt
from its need at some time or other.
So that no individual can escape the
normal responsibility for its support.
That you have no immediate need for
a hospital, that your wife and children
are blessed with abounding health
to-day, does not mean that they are
sure to be so fortunate tomorrow.
"The Wittenberg Hospital has
struggled bravely along doing the
best it could under conditions so far
from ideal that it has seemed almost
a miracle that the fine results have
been produced which stand to its
credit. It has, up to the present time,
been directed by a board composed
entirely of members of the Lutheran
Church although it has always open
ed its doors to sufferers of every
creed. The present Board of Direc
tors, composed of L. C. Wingate,
Simon Westby, Rev. M. J. Evensen,
Rev. C. Sumstad and Rev. A. Johan
sen, in bringing the hospital before
the public at this time propose to en
large the board to include representa
tives of other denominations, so mak
ing the new hospital the natural pride
of every citizen of Williston."
Good Support
For Athletics
The student body of the schools
have responded with enthusiasm to
the financial support of football for
the year. They have subscribed for
season tickets to the extent of $105.25,
by far the most liberal suoport the
high school has ever given its team.
To make the needed $225. for the sea
son's expense, it was hoped that one
hundred season tickets at a dollar and
a quarter each could be sold about
town to business men and others. But
the fact that the games are scheduled
on Saturdays, the busiest day of the
week, prevented more than a meager
sale. The students will themselves
undertake other means of meeting
the approaching deficit.

George Didn't Do It
Hence These Tears
What is the most expensive
mistake you ever made? The
prize for the best answer will be
announced after the editor sees
how good your story is.
"The biggest mistake I ever
made," said Geo. W. New
ton, "was when I passed up an
offer of 160 acres of land in the
heart of the present Williston,
from Fourth street north, for a
•eaaelly $700. and I had the
money, too."
"A man named Aderson filed
on the quarter section," contin
ued Mr. Newton "and afterward
lost his life in a well. A fellow
named Landahl was the sole heir.
When the Klondyke gold fever
swept over the country Landahl
was crazy to join a party and
go. He begged me to give him
the seven hundred he needed.
Would I do it? Not me—we
wanted a new house."
"How much is the land worth
now? Somewhere about a half
million." And George left the
drug store whistling. Certainly,
George, not the drug store.
ARTESIAN FLOW
VALUABLE FIND
FLOWING WELLS OF GREAT AD
VANTAGE TO RIVER RANCH
ERS—BURDICK GUSHER
Because of the faith of two men,
both typical of those who. are devel
oping tne wealth of western North
Dakota, a Williams county asset of
great value was discovered, when a
fine flow of water was tapped on U.
L. Burdick's farm two miles east of
Williston, October 5th.
J. W. Barrett, who has followed
with great success the business of
drilling artesian wells in the south
western part of the state had faith
that flowing wells could be secored.in
this part of the state along the Mis
souri river. U. L. Burdick. with
characteristic courage, was willing to
take a chance on such a venture so
Mr. Barret shipped a drilling outfit
here and left it in charge of his son.
In remarkably short time a four inch
hole was sunk to a depth of 655 feet
and a flow was found of sufficient
pressure to lift the water 30 feet
above the surface of the ground.
Value of Warm Water
The water is of good quality and
comes out of the ground at a tem
perature that is ideal for stock, es
pecially in cold weather. Mr. Bar
rett states that water from such a
well, allowed to flow through an open
tank, will not freeze in any weather.
According to live stock authorties the
value of comparatively warm water
for stock in winter can scarcely be
estimated. Stock will drink more
than they would of icy water and less
of the energy derived from their food
is required to bring the water drunk
to the temperature of their bodies.
Besides the advantage in temperature
the water is always ready and pump
ing and ice chopping is done away
with.
Mr. Barrett ,is confident that flow
ing wells can be had at almost any
point in the river valley where the
altitude is not too great. If he is
correct it is another important ad
vantage added to the natural features
that make this one of best of the best,
as a stock raising district.
Other stock men will have Mr.
Barrett try for wells on their river
ranches.

For Our Readers
In this issue The Graphic in
troduces for the approval of its
readers a new department devoted
to the news and interests of the
schools of Williams county, under
the heading, "With the County
Schools."
The Graphic believes there is
no more vital force in the social
and industrial growth of the
county and state than the public
schools that a newspaper can
perform no higher service than
to cooperate with those working
in and for the schools.
Williams county is making re
markable educational progress.
The reports of state school offi
cials leave no room for doubt
that our schools, both rural and
city, stand in the front rank.
In the new department in this
issue will be found an approxi

teachers of the county, also a list

UNDERWOOD TARIFF
CUMMINS' TAR6ET
IOWA SOLON ATTACKS DEMO
CRATIC POLICIES AND AD
VOCATES PROTECTION
Albert B. Cummins, United Statess
senator from Iowa, and a statesman
of such national repute as to have
been seriously considered for the pres
idency, speaking to an audience at the
court house last evening, poured ar
gumentative hot shot into the Wilson
administration, his favorite mark be
ing the Underwood tariff law which
he termed the most remarkable com
bination of ignorance and indifference
ever placed on the legislative records.
The figure of the spare, white hair
ed veteran of many political battles,
drawing near to his hearers, some
times ev6n advancing into an isle,
speaking Mowly, calmly, dispassion
ately and with persuasive logic, was
one of the most interesting an au
dience could ask for. His earnestness
of ^manner and fairness of argument
were calculated to carry conviction to
those before him. He indulged is none
of the devices of ridicule or sarcasm
and had nothing to ask, for himself,
but devoted his effort to his mission
of bringing home to his hearers the
necessity for republican victory in
this election.
Senator Cummins made but slight
.reference to Mr. Hughes but argued
the soundness and expediency of the
policy of high protective tariff against
the folly and inefficiency of tariff for
revenue only. He believed there was
such a thing as a tariff that was too
high and believed we had experienced
tariff schedules unnecessarily high.
He explained that the close of thu
European war was certain to bring
conditions that would make protection
of American interests and home mar
kets essential to commercial welfare.
All the nations of Europe, he said,
expect Great Britain, had long fol
lowed the protection policy, as a
means to commercial preparedness.
In the early part of his speech the
senator dealt with the need of mili
tary preparedness. In conclusion he
dwelt qn foreign affairs, finding much
to criticise in the course pursued by
the president, especially as to Mex
ico. He believed that in the last three
or four years the United States had
lost prestige in the estimation of oth
er leading nations—a fact that should
wound our pride. "And we must have
pride," said the senator, "for without
pride there can be no progress."

In a year of widespread disaster to

the careful consideration of grain
farmers. The yields on the variety
test plots or separated strips average
so far above those on the large fields
of the ordinary farm that it is diffi
cult to understand where the differ
ence lies. It has been suggested that
the extra sunshine and moisture re
ceived because of the open spaces be
tween the strips may be one of the
answers.
It is said that in some portions of
the semi-arid Southwest farmers'
practice inter-tillage—planting their
small grain in narrow fields with open
strips between, wide enough to cul
tivate. There may be great value in*
the idea for the man farming a smalt
acreage and willing to devote fill
self to intensive methods.

It should be said that just ordinary
good farming, including thorough till

seed, is used at the farm and there

of the farm for over two years. The

Hughes Elected
Last Saturday
While the crowd of ball fans were
receiving the news of the world series.
some one proposed a straw vote on
president. Nearly half the crowd
was composed of democrats, apparent
ly, and Charlie Mansfield fell for the
idea instantly.
So they made him one of the tellers
and he was asked to read the ballots.
He read: "Hughes—Hughes—Hughes
Hughes— Hughes Hughes," etc,
etc., about 17 of them. C. A. stopped
to adjust his glasses, and again it
was "Hughes, Hughes, Hughes," and
then some.
By the time the land officg receiver's
own ballot showed up he smelled
something—and tryed to do an awful
thing—a disgraceful act, towit: change
his vote to HUGHES.
But they nabbed him in the act, and
made him stand pat. Result: Hughes
27 Wilson 1.
Charlie says he thinks the straw
was rusted. And that straw votes are
like dreams—go by contraries.
