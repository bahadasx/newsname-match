STATE Fi RIBBONS
The state fair this year did not
pay cash premiums on individual
exhibits, but awarded premium
ribbons. We now have a list of
the ribbons awarded on individ
ual exhibits contained in the Tor
rance county exhibit at the state
fair, which is as follows:
Squaw corn, B. L. Stevens
first.
White dent corn, A. W. Lyttle
first.
Yellow dent corn. W. E. Cawl-
field second.

Display forage crops, first.

tatoes, first.

toes, second.

tatoes, S. J. Hubbard first.

(The three preceding articles
came from Willard and we have
been unable to learn the name of
the producer.)

tained) first.

It will be some time before the
winners in the boys' and girls'
clubs will be known. Somebody
watched the scoring and report
ed that the two Mountainair
boys got the highest score on the
quality of their beans. This is
good, of course, bur it doesn't by
any means decide who will get
the premium. The beans must
be threshed and the exact yield
reported. The quality, the quan
tity, the story, and the cost, all
enter into the competition. We
will watch for the announcement
of the winnt-rs and give our read
ers the names as enrly as possi
ble. SCHOOL NOTES
School is progressing with a
zeal upon the part of all con
cerned which is manifestly satis
factory to everyone. Our en
rollment has reached the 100
mark exactly with more expect
ed. Several of our students attend
ed the fair at Willard on Thurs
day. Among them were Pauline
Hues, Ralph Epler and Guy
M anker.
The board of education, realiz
ing the value of "everybody"
boosting for the county, voted a
half holiday on Friday so that
the school might attend the Es
tancia fair. Prof. Park's room
was even more fortunate as the
teachers' examinations were held
in his room all day Friday.
Prof. B. G. Woodward, super
intendent of Mountainair schools,
spent the week end with Prof.
Park and his mother. Prof.
Woodward reports the building
at. Mountainair complete and
pvervbodv boosting. Let's fol
low their example.
Prof. Ferguson of Willard was
also'a visitor to the Estancia fair
nn Saturday.
The board reports that work
nn the new building will be be
pun in the very near future. The
monev from the sale of bonds is
on hand and nothing should
cause any further delay but the
time reauired by the contractor
to begin work.

at Grangeville, Idaho, came in

will remain in Idaho during the
winter on account of school, but
will ioin him here in the spring.
Mr. Baker found the Idaho cli
mate quite trying on his rheuma
tism and thought he would be
better here, which was his rea
son for coming in advance of the
family. We welcome him back,
and hope they will keep coming.
Joe Fehmer came in about a
week ago to see how things are
stacking up in the valley. He
has been going to school at Val

Eleventh St., Albuquerque, N. Méx.,
says: "I don't hesitate to recommend
Doan'a Kidney Pills for backache and
other kidney trouble. In my case,
they brought immediate relief from
backache. I know of another case
where Doan's Kidney Pills brought
positive relief from backache, due to
weak kidneys."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. Vickrey had. Foster-Milburn Co.,

WHAT CATARRH IS
It has been said that every third
person has catarrh in some form.
Science has shown that nasal catarrh
often indicates a general weakness
of the body; and local treatments in
the form of snuffs and vapors do little,
if any good.
To correct catarrh you should treat its
cause by enriching your blood with the
oil-food in Scott's Emulsion which is a
medicinal food and a building-tonic, free
fronialcohol or any harmful drugs. Try it.
Scott & Bowne, Bloomfield. N. J. C
T. L. CAPT
'As will be seen by announce
ment elsewhere in this paper, T.
L. Capt. a well known cattle
man of Mountainair, is a candi
date for the nomination for sher
iff, subject to the consideration
of the Democratic county con
vention. Wherever he has lived
Mr. Capt has established a rep
utation as a square man by his
uprightness and fair dealing in
business matters. He served tor
a number of years as an officer
of the Live Stock Sanitary Board,
and while a member of that force
proved himself to be fearless and
of good judgment in the dis
charge of his duties, impartial as
to individuals, faithful in tulhll-
ing his obligations as a member
of that force. Should the Demo
cratic convention see fit to select
him as its nominee, they would
have as a candidate, a man with
whom the voters could find no
fault. He possesses all the re
quired qualifications for the posi
tion of sheriff, and is entirely
free from rings and cliques, adv
