In the earlier days of the Govern
ment, it was found that a bookkeeping
"division was required and the office of
treasurer was created. In the first
instance, men familiar with bank
keeping w«re appointed treasurer be
cause it was thought they would be
better able to devise systems of book
keeping for the Treasury accounts.
-Soon Afterward, expert accountants
came into general use but the office
of Treasurer was never abolished.
For thirty years neither Mr. Buike
nor any other treasurer has in fact
''been xequired^tp have special know
ledge of' ft$"fc|eipihg of accounts.
More than ififty years ago a system
was devised whereby every account
was a check on every other account
and the office of treasurer was simply
a devise through which the funds of
the country go. The treasurer re
ceipts for all funds received and signs
all vouchers for disbursements for
anoney. For every penny the treas
urer puts into the treasury he pre
sents a voucher from some other offi
•ciai. He does not necessarily know
4Uid is not expected to know where the
money comes from or where it goes,
-except by a voucher from some other
offtei&l. He is a bookkeeper pure and
simple, without any authority to dic
tate to aity'bank, corporation or per
son. He 'ddes not have anything like
the authority that is exercised by a
•county treasurer in .North Dakota and
any stafatttat as to what he proposes
to do wittf-'Ae Government funds or
"the banks of the country would have
no importance.

Washington, Oct. 7r—(Special)—
Statements coming from North Da

Burke, now Treasurer of the United
.States and a candidate for the United
States Senatorship, is being repre
sented ad one who is influential in the
management of the fiscal affairs of
the Government, because .of his offi
•cial position, are causing amusement
liere as do many unfounded notions
that gain currency throughout the
•country in respect to^ conditions in
Washington.
The fact is, neither Mr. Burke nor
•any -other Treasurer of ,t|ie United
States has hdd anything to do with
the ftieal affairs of^ Ae GoteariimMi*
far as ^aocerns directing policies
,. by virtue j^ihat position. Ilie-treasr
tner of ttieiJniM States acts as head
bookkeeper in an establishment where
1y long useage a fixed system of
tiookkeeping lias been so fully crystal
zed that there is no need for directive
powers. The Treasurer of the United
•States has nothing whatever to do
with the biuiks of the country nor
with, the issuance of currency. Such
matters are controlled by the Secre
tary of the Treasury through the com
ptrollers of the Treasury and the Cur

CORN, OATS, WHEAT FOR SEED
In an experiment at the Wisconsin
Experiment Station 3, lots of heife.s
weighing about 350 pounds were fed
equal amounts of nutrients For one
lot the nutrients were wholly from
wheat plant, another from oats and
the third from corn. All lots grew
at about a normal rate, but after a
few months it became easily observa
ble that the wheat lot was not so well
nourished as the others. This was ev
ident from the appearance of the coat.
The corn and oat fed lots bred earlier
than the wheat fed one, showing that
the latter were depressed in some de
gree. The corn fed lot produced
calves which were of normal size and
full of vigor. The oat lot produced
calves, which were of about normal
mze but with veiy low vigor, while
those from the wheat lot were about
half as large as the normal .calf at
birth an dwere dead or ready to die
when born. When half of the rough
age of the wheat lot was replaced with
alfalfa hay the calves were normal.
No reasons have been worked out as
to why these foods should act so dif
ferently but it is important to know
how they affect animals.—N. D. Ex

One of the ablest political addresses
ever given in our city was the one
which was given by Senator A. B.
Cummins, of Iowa, in the Court house
Tuesday evening. Long before the
time came to introduce the speaker
the house was'packed and many peo
ple turned away for the'Iack of even
standing room.. The-'speaker held the
closest attention of his audience for
nearly an, hour and a half, and his ar
guments were positive and convinc
ing. In his opening remarks he
touched upon the matter of North Da
kota's representation in the U. S sen
ate, and showed just why Porter J.
McCumber should be re-elected. He
stated to his listeners that North Da
kota would make a serious mistake if
they failed to return Mr. McCumber
to the senate, as he is one of the ablest
men that there is in the U. S. Senate
today. Cummins is recognized as one
of the big men of this nation today,
and has the reputation of being emi
nently fair in all matters, and his
statements carry much weight, and
any. statement he makes he has the
proof to back it up, and in some of his
arguments he surprised his listeners.
He touched upon the tariff law, the
Federal Reserve bank law, the Adam
son law, better known as the eight
hour law, the Federal Farm Loan
law, and showed where they were all
weak, and many of them impossible
to put into operation.
After his address a reception was
tendered him at the Commercial club
rooms.
MISS JOSEPHINE KlRKENHEF
NER, FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT.
A terrible, shooting accident occur

ing only about three feet from the
Mr. Swartzenberger, who lives on
the west side, was about to leave his
home to go plowing on a farm which
he rents near the city, and thought he
would carry his gun along. He pick
ed up the gun and started to leave the
house when it went off, the entire
charge striking the young woman in
the lower port of the back tearing its
way entirely through her body. She
was rushed to the hospital and every
thing possible is being done to save
her life and while the chances are
somewhat against her, there is a bare
possibility that she may recover. Mr.
Swartzenberger did not know that the
gun was loaded when he picked it up,
and he is grief stricken over the af
fair. The young lady is. his sister-in
law and was making her home at his
place.
