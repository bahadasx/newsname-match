I Harp, on Quality and Service.
USE GAS for heating. It is cheap
er and much nicer than coal. No
trouble either, if you haye one of our
ronton ESSunsen Heaters
Not like any other Gas Heater. Gives
more heat on much less fuel and will
burn when the pressure is too low
for ordinary stoves. Try one for 10
days at our risk. Money back if not
satisfied. Call and see, one before
you buy a heating stove.

ELECTION DAY,
DI1A17S HEAR
ii -
If You Want to Vote Make Sure
Your Name la on The
.Registration Book
It is time that the city voters
were thinking; about their regis
tration!
Election day will come three
weeks from next Tuesday, on
November 7, and the registra
tion books will close ten days
before that time or on October
27, at 10 o'clock at night.
Because of the fact that it is a
presidential election and more
interest is being shown, Baxter
ahould hrve a record breaking
registration when the books close
two weeks from next Friday
night
All persons who voted at the
last general election or when
state officers were chosen, and
have not changed their street
address since, seed not register
for the coming election.
All persons who failed to vote
at the last general election, or,
have moved since that time or
since they registered and all new
voters, must register' with the
city clerk before they can vote
next month.
In any event the better plan is
to call on the city clerk and make
sure of the matter. It is better
to make the call and find that
yon are already registered than
to be denied a ballot on election
day.
The registration books are open
at the city clerk's ofice any time
daring the day with the excep
tion of the noon hour, and during
the last few daya before dosing
will be open all day long and up
Tnntil 10 o'clock at night.
Avoid the rush and attend to
the matter now!

LIKES THE OLD TOWN
Former Baxterite After a Visit
Here Writes Back to
Old Friends.
Fort Dodgp, Kans., Sept. 9, 1916.
Editor Baxter Springs News:
We are taking advantage of your
generous offer of your newsy little
paper of one dollar before the 15th
of the month, for I guess we want
to know what is going on in the
old town, if we are away out here.
We regretted having to make so
Short a stay there, for we think
it a delightful place to live but
we had to move on.
We left here the last of August,
took the Santa Fe train at Dodge
City, went to Kansas City, saw
the old soldiers gathering for
their great national meet, then
on the Frisco down to Fulton,
our old home, for a few days then
on to Baxter, Quapaw and Joplin.
How we did enjoy meeting old
faces and friends and the Chau
tauqua and Brother Hoopingar
ner's sermon and everything, for
after all, its the simple friend
ships of life that give it its real
sweetness.
We came back on the Frisco to
Burrton, then on the Santa Fe to
Dodge City in time for the reun
ion of the old soldiers of the
west We heard some good
speeches of both the governor of
Kansas and Colorado, also heard
the three congressman from the
short grass country, who are
running in the tickets, namely,
Mr. Howard Kershner, prohibi
tion; Mr. Joint Sharee, democrat;
Mr. Simmons, republican. Now
its wonderful what will be done
if either are elected. The plot
thickens, Hot air is freely dis
tributed here as elsewhere .and
everybody knowa all about the
European war and how to atop it
and all about the Mexican
troubles and a remedy. Its truly
wonderful how well we are in
formed and how little we know.
It is written that destiny has two
ways of heading us off, one by
granting, the other by denying
us our desires. It is not possible
to know where the rain will fall
so here's hoping the best for all
and the best for the future of
Baxter, that can come to any old
town. Yours truly.
Mas. R. C BoacHAM. '

THOUSANDS ARE
BAXTERJSUESTS
Two Days Celebration Attracts
Crowds Here and All Have
Time of Their Lives.
Anti Days were the best erer
The Most successful celebration
Baxter Springs has had in many
years.
Such was the universal verdict
of the many thousands who spent
Friday and Saturday here taking
in the excellent programs o
parades, races and contests,
mingling with friends and having
a general good time.
The weather was fine and the
program was carried out without
a hitch.
The Friday parade brought
out much admiration and com
ment. O'er 700 school children
were in line, and this exhibit of
young America removed all fears
of Baxter becoming depopulated
on account of race auicide. The
city schools had about 400 in
line, a very strong argument
indeed for the erection of another
school house to take care of the
rapidly increasing enrollment.
The schools this year are so
crowded that it is impossible to
do the work as it should be done.
The mask or Calithumpian
parade waa an amusing part of
the program. The maskers also
had a big time. For the most
comical costumes the Misses
Clara May Noble and Grace
Thomas, dressed as an old man
and old woman, won first prise,
and Jim Smith and Irvin Hocker,
dressed as a coon couple in high
society won second prise.
The school prises were distri
buted as follows:
For the District-school -room
having the largest number in,
line $10 was divided between the
Star school and the advanced
room of the Mitchell school, both
having the same number.
Mrs. J. E. Simmons of Grace
school won the prize of $5.00 for
having the largest percentage of
total enrollment in the parade.
In the Anti parade on Satur
day, the Southeast Kansas lodge
won the prize offered for the
greatest number on horseback in
line.
Ottawa lodge came the longest
distance, had 16 in line and won
that prise.
S. L. Winters of Willow Creek
lodge was the oldest Anti in line.
W. H. Estes of Ottawa lodge
was the fattest Anti.
The Pittsburg Shriners band
made a big hit with the people.
The music was about the best
ever heard in Baxter, they all say.
P. M. Hefiey, Willow Creek
lodge, had the beat team in the
parade.
Golden Rule lodge won from
Southeast Kansas in the tug of
war.
The children Vraces were hotly
contested and the prise money
mostly was used during the day
in filling up with bon bons and
ice cream the stomachs made
empty by the lively exercise.
The Presbyterian ladiea have
requested the News to thank the
public for the nice patronage
given at the dinner served Satur
day. The lucky patrons are
grateful . to the ladies, also for
providing .such a good dinner.
The ladies also extend public
thanks to the Pearl Grocery for
pnmding a 4 sufficient suppy of
their Beable'a Butter Bread,
which by the way, melted away
before the hungry diners like
snow in a July sun. The coffee,
about which so many enthused,
was the Red Wolf brand donated
byEthe White House grocery.
The Willard Co. donated the
float.
