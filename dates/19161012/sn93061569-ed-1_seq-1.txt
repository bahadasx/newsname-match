So Delinquent Taxpayers May Know
Raton, N. M., October 5, 1916.
The Hon. Thos. S. Snyder, Clayton,
. New Mexico.
Dear Captain:
I am sending you, today, a copy of
an estimate just received of the delin
quent tax list printed in the Clayton
News for the delinquent taxes of 1914,
Union County.
Trusting that you will make such
settlement as will fully protect the
county's interest, I beg to remain,
Yours very truly,
O. L. Phillips.
P. S. This covers four pages. I assume
it is the entire publication. If there
was more advise me.".
Now, Mr. Delinquent Taxpayer, you
can see that the "FACTS" which the
r.itizen has been so "carefully sup
pressing" are beginning to bear fruit
can't you?
The above from the district attor
ney's office is due notice to the board
nf ponntv commissioners of Union
county that the people's treasury will
not be invaded in the payment of fla
grantly illegal amounts for the publi
cation of at least one delinquent tax
list that does not conform to law. Last
year the Citizen complained that the
law was not being complied with in
the matter of publishing delinquent
tax lists since the law of 1915 respect
ing such publications was passed; and
it has been pounding away on this
line at various times ever since. Now
it has come to a "show down" so far
as your county treasury is concerned,
but how is it going to work in your in
dividual case.
yourself to a post and invite your
wife and children to wear it out on
you for not having sense enough to
protect the interests of the family to
which you are a gleaming disgrace.
And what is true of the tax list pub
lished this year is also true of the tax
list published last year. Prior to that
time the laws of 1915, respecting such
publications, were not in effect. If
you have already paid this unlawful
amount demand its return to you.
Now the Citteen has been telling
you the truth about this matter as
well as other matters of vast concern
to you. It has told you the truth about
tax sale certificates and we are going
to show you that we have the same au
thority to bear us out. This we shall
do next week.
A pretty mess, indeed, this Oklahoma-bossed
jimmyocracy has vom
ited upon Union county, isn't it- The
Citizen has also told you the truth
about the Droflitrate nrodigality of
the jimmycratic board of county com-'
missioners in reckless expenditures -of
the people's money; the expenditures
of your road money; "executive" ses
sions for the purpose of evading plain
provisions of the law; failures to com
ply with the election laws thereby pur
posely disfranchising voters in this
county; and that is why the Citizen is
not loved by the Oklahoma-New Mex
ico miscegenation of jimmycrats.
These are its only enemies and we are
proud of them. Wc have never lost
a friend we needed nor gained one we
did not need and the Citizen will con
tinue to tell you the truth. Here is
another fact you may digest. Had the

"Here's to the man that invented
the Ingersoll watch; he had brains.
And here's to the nameless quill push
er of the Clayton Citizen; may he live
a thousand years so that after dissolu
tion his cranial vacuum may reveal
something more than bray and bellyache.
After the Rocky Mountain canary
that pushes a quill for the Clayton
Citizen had finished braying last week
he was no nearer telling the truth
about the county printing than in
previous articles. The Swastika ob
jected to the bald statement that the
commissioners had allowed the News
something over $5,000 for publishing
the commissioner's proceedings and
delinquent tax list. The Citizen calls
attention to the fact that the job
prining for the county superintendent
is itemized separately. We give the
quill driver of the Citizen credit for
enough brains to distingush the fact
that each any every other office in the
court house has used some printing
and evidently this printing is includ-
ed in the sum charged as paid for pro
ceedings and tax list. Even a genus
homo of the common garden variety
of fool can search out the animus back
of the Citizen's article. Being hungry
he naturally brays for a stall at the
public crib. AH Rock Mountain can
aries are alike in this particular. "So
the people may know!" Don't make
us laugh, Oswald; we have a cracked
lip. During the past few months the
i Citizen has suppressed news concern
ing all the crimes in the category be'
cause of reasons best known to them
selves. "So the people may know!"
Shade of Diogones! Judas Iscariot
betrayed his Lord for 30 pieces of sil
ver and so has. the Citizen betrayed
the cause of the people it is so inter
"stei in by suppressing facts every
issue since the campaign started; in
fact a perusal of any issue of the Cit
izen will reveal the tact that every
Democrat is a potential criminal and
all Republicans have rprouted wings,
"So the people may know!" Lay on
Macduff! With the Citizen anything is
legitimate if it leads back to the pork
barrel." Des Moines Swastika.
Ordinarily we would not permit the
columns of the Citizen to trespass up
on the attention of our readers by
brine'ng to notice such insipient va
powerful official criticism. He did not
leave the so-called democratic admin
istration any standing room on the
stage of criticism. His arguments
and statement of facts are 'absolutely
unanswerable and it is quite certain
that jimmyocracy will not attempt to
answer them. There was not a par
agraph in his speech that was not un-
animously applauded.
Mr.. Lindsey followed with a few
rous'ng, well-rounded, trenchant, re-
marks that were punctuated by hearty
applause. He very clearly demon
strated in the short time he occupied
the floor, that in case the mantle of
governor should fall upon him it
.vould be worn with honor and ability.
vMr. Wagner followed Mr. Lindsey.
He fairly electrified the audience with
his eloquence. Like a Bryan or a
Bailey he held his audience spell-bound
until every climax was reached, which
vns the end of every sentence, when
it would break loose in unsubdued ap
plause. Although he did not occupy
the floor ton ril; utes, there was not
a man in the audience who did not feel
that the interests of the school child
ren in this state would be perfectly
safe in his hands. He left; the floor

in its columns? No, you have not
and you will not. Why does not this
Oklahoma jimmycrat give you the fig
ures ? Why does he not explain to you
why it was that in the year 1914, when
the Citizen forced a show down on
bids for county printing, even though
it had to do so in spite of secret ses
sions of the boaVd of county commis
sioners, that the English, so-called
"official organ got $464.42, while in
the year 1912 it got $1160.13; in the
year 1913, $818.79; and in the years
1915 and 1916 up to July 7, $885.29?
Nor is there a single penny for pub
lishing delinquent tax lists included
in the above amounts. These amounts
foot up $3334.63 and of this amount
$1,038.45 is marked under the column
of "For What Service" "Publishing.
Com. Min. etc." while $2,014.78 is
marked in the same column, "Pub.
Com. Min." alone and one amount,
namely, $281.40 is marked "Printing"'
alone. Why doesn't the Oklahoma
jimmycrat tell the people how much -of
this money is for this or that in
stead of vomiting Insipient vapidty
upon its limited readers. Nor have
we given all the English so-called "of
ficial organ" got. There are other
amounts marked "job work" that are
not included in the above and it is pure
assumption to say that "etc" in the
above is for job work. It may mean
something else just as well and who,
but the Oklahoma jimmycrat, the jim
myocracy of whose like is being sent
to its everlasting oblivion in Oklaho
ma by republicans and socialists, is
going to assume this or that just for
the benefit of the jimmycratic gang
of Oklahoma-bossed jimmyocracy in
Union county? No wonder "So the
people may know!" is a wasp, under
the shirt of jimmyocracy, that stings
without losing its 3t:;-.go:'! It is not
the record of the republican party, nor
the socialist party, nor any other
party but the jimmycratic party, en
gineered, manned, bossed and ruled
over by a miscegenation of Oklaho
ma and New Mexico jimmycrats. Nor
yet is it the record of the Clayton Cit
izen. Nor yet is it the record of dem
ocracy. There is a vast difference be.
tween democracy and jimmyocracy,
but jimmyocracy is in the saddle at,
present and must stand upon its own
record. If our mild tempered little
