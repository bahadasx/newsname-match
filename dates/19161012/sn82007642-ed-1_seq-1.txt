Tasks" Fornidabli Weapons in Modern
Warfare. -
Dispatches from the war zone
during the past few days have
given cosiderable attention to
I'tanks", a kind of war machine
in the hands of the British army.
The "tanks" have done effective
work in smashing the German
lines in northern France.
The "tanks" are armored mo
. tor cars. They were built for the
most part in Peoria, 111., as cat
erpillar tractors, designed many
years before the war began, to
meet some of the difficult prob
lem of modern farming. Except
for the armor, their machine
guns'and their crews, thousands
are in use today in the United
States in plowing, digging ditch
es and other labors less heroic
than war.
M. M. Baker, vice president of
the Holt Manufacturing Compa
ny, says it was machines made
by his company at its Peoria
plant that hurdled German tren
ches, walked through forests and
crawled over shell craters in the
face of intense rifle and machine
gun fires.
"It is true," said Mr. .Baker,
"thatthese tractors can go a
head over almost anything.
They can straddle a trench, go
through a swamp, roll over logs,
or climb through shell craters
like a car or a juggernaut. It
looks uncanny to see them crawl
along the ground, just like a
huge caterpillar. In a thick for
est, if they encountered trues
they could not brush out of their
way, they could easily be used
to uproot them and dear their
own paths."
Mr. Baker said the .tractors
sent to England weigh about 18,
000 pounds each, develop 120
horse power and are built of
steel. The caterpillar feature, he
explained, is of the utmost impor
tance. Speaking broadly, the
tractor crawls on two belts, with
corrugated surfaces, on either
side of the body. The corrugat
ed surface is on the ground. Or
the inside of the belts, on each
side of the body, are two lines of
steel rails, making four lines in
all. These rails are in short
. sections, jointed and operate
over a cogged mechanism that
actually lay them down with
their belt attachment as the trac
1 tor moves ahead and picks them
up again, so the car runs on its
own self-made track conuniousiy
The short joints in the rails make
it easy to turn to the right or
left.
The body is supported by
trucks with five wheels, some
thing like small railroad trucks.
Thw wheels never touch the
ground but run upon the steel
: rails. In the ordinary tractor
about seven feet of belt and rails
is on the ground at one time.
Mr. Baker Baid that the machiue
would bridge any trench that
. was not wider than the length of
. track it llaid ou the ground at
one time. The "bow"' might hit
the far side of the trench far be
low the top, and the "stern"
' would undoubly sink a little, but
the tenacity of the tractor, he de
clared would enable it to go a
head an! climb out.
It was reported that the Uni
ted State3 government would
provide these 'tanks' for our ar
my, but this Is denied. It is ex
plainedjat'the War Department
that 27 caterpillar motoa ; re
cently ordered by tb-jpart-
ment are for the orary purpo-
ooa rniph as towiiwoicr suns, for
MVVJ SJ WW
which similar cars buve been us
' , ed In the army for years.

FOR 'FLETCHER'S
CAS.T.ORI A
We Forgtt.
We resolve at the beginning of
each political campaign that we
will not be swept away by the
fierce assalts that the leaders of
each party make against the
other, but as the fight waxes hot
ter we find ourselves borne along
on the turbulent tide and joining
in the general clamor of denunci
ation and detraction. We forget
-our good.resolutionandcry "cru
cify him" with the rest. Perhaps
it may not be amies to stop with
in five weeks of the election, and
recall our determination to be
calm and serene in the midst of
the storm. The other man is not
half as bad as he is painted. The
caniddates of both sides are
honest as politicians go, and sin
cerely desire to see our country
prosperous and progressive. We
are all in the same boat, and
what affects one affects all. We
must live or die, survive or per
ish together. We all love the flag
and the last one o us st ands rea
dy to defend it. Then why in the
name of common sense do we a
buscfeach other and Bay all man
ner of evil against one another
during the three or four months
preceding the election. After the
election we are good friends a-
gain and the old relations are re
newed. The curious thing about
it all is, the candidates them
selves never get offended at each
other. They ride, sleep, eat and
dwell together in unity. When
they get before the public they
make the fur fly and pretend to
be furious, but. as soon as tne
back of the public is turned they
are as chummy as brothers, and
augh at the way the boys laugh
other. We are ' the ones who
make fools of ourselves and not
the honorable gentlemen who are
running for office. They make a
pretense of being greatly offend
ed and cut up all sorts of shines
or pay! We snarl at each other
and say ugly words fob noth
ing. No wonder they laugh at
us. Brethren, lets turn the joke
on tuem tins ura. ueis Keep
sweet and refuse to get mad and
give the men on the other Bide
credit for the same honesty and
sincerity we claim for ourselves.
You know we determined to do
this last summer before the pot
began to boil. If we have forgot
ten and said some fool tning let
us put on the lid and sit on it.

Young Man Kills Sweetheart
Lenoir Topic, 4th.
Intense excitement prevailed in
Lenoir and surrounding county
last Sunday evening when it was
learned that Miss Florence Sut
phin, a young woman about 17
years of age, was shot and killed
by Charles Walker on a road
near town.
It appears that Walker, aged
about 19 years, son of James
Walker, of near Draco, Little
River township, had been for
sometime paying attention to
Miss Sutphin, who lived with her
mother and step-father, Mr. and
Mrs. Whitener, in the eastern
part of Lenoir. On Saturday eve
ning he came to see her, but she
told him that she had decided
not togo with bim any longer.
After making some threats Walk
er left the house. Sunday morn
ing, he came back to see her, but
went away when he was told a
gain that his attentions were not
acceptable. Expressing fears
about going alone, Miss Sutphin
went to Sunday school at the
Baptist church here in company
with other young women. On
Sunday afternoon, accompanied
by two small Martin girls, she
was walking out to Mr. James
Haigler's on the Taylorsville
road about three miles from
town when Walker appeared on
the scene and demanded, "Flor
ence, ain t you going wren me
any more?" According to evi
dence as given by the two little
girls, she promptly replied, 'No.'
Walker's reply was, 'You know
what I have told you, then', the
reference being to a former threat
to kill her in case she turned him
down. The girls started off to
gether, when Walker 'fired three
times at his sweetheart with a
38 caliber pistol, one bullet ta
king effect in the back of her
head. Walker then ran into the
woods and the two little girls
went hastily Mr. Haigler's to
give the alarm. On their return
they found that the young wo
man was dead, the belief being
that death was almost instanta
neous. On account of the illness
of the dead girl's mother, her re
mains were brought to the home
of Mr. W. L. Ernest and prepar
ed for burial, which took place
at King's Creek Monday.
Immediately after being notifi
ed, Sheriff Triplett and his depu
ties left by automobile in search
of the perpetrator of the crime
Getting on his trail, the officers
located him at the home of hi
brother, S. M. Walker, in ' Little
River township in whose home the
arrest was made without resist
ance, though Walker is reported
to have said that he would die
before he would'allow the officers
to bring him to Lenoir. The fa
tal shot was fired late in the af
ternoon, and before 10 o'clock
at night the guilty party was be
hind the iron bars of the county
jail. ,
Walker claims that the killing
was accidental T that in changing
the pistol from 6ne pocket to an
other the weapon discharged
without evil intentions on his
part.

CANDIDATE HUGHES. .
The followin from tho Mount
Vernon, (Ky.) Signal, was hand
ed The Democrat by W. L. Bry
an, Esq., and is well worth read
ing twice:
Mr. Hughes' policy as a candi
date for the high office of Presi
dent does not have a tendency to
aise him in the estimation of
the voters, even of his own party.
Ie seeras to adopt the easy job
of picking flaws and criticising
the present administration. In
no important respect does he
suggest constructive legislation.
le has been asked many ques
tions as to what he should have
done under conditions confront
ing our President, but never has
he answered. Many of the great
authors aud writers of the coun
try joined in asking him nine
teen questions, but up to this
time he has failed to answer any
one of them. Why? Because, as
lalph Cole, Chairman of the
Speakers' Bureau of tho Republi
can Party, says Hughes has not
the inside information. W h y
should he criticise if he cannot
give us something better? Under
the Wilson Administration the
country has been given the Fed
eral Bank Reserve Act. Panic
among one hundred million peo
ple, in command of a mighty few
gamblers, is no longer possible.
t is constructive and for thf peo
ple. The Clayton legislation takes
human labor and lives from the
ist of market commodities and
articles of commerce. It is con
structive and for the people. The
Child-labor legislation saves the
most precious possessions of this
nation, frees children. It is con
structive and for the people of
this and future generations.
The Farm Loan Act is freedom
and opportunity for tho sinew,
bone and soul of thd country. It
is constructive and for the whole
people in its financial effort.
The Seaman's Act, the Armour
Plate plant, the Nitrate plant,
the Preparedness and other mea
sures enacted under the guiding
hand of President Wilson means
freedom, safety and advance
ment of all true American ideas,
They are constructive and for
the people. Right here in Ameri
ca, in our business, in our homes,
in tne lives oi our cnuuren. we
are having and are to have the
splendid effects of rWoodrow Wil
son's engineering of constructive
law that mean letter liven, bel
ter people and a much better na
tion.
In view of such splendid work
and tho enactment of such whole
some laws, it is the best interest
of the whole people to continue
such a man in office and that
man is Woodrow Wilson.
Just the Thing for Diarehoen.
"About two years ngo I hnd a
severe attack of dinrrhoea which
lusted over a we," writes W C
Joni'S, Budford, N. D. "I beenme
so weak that I could not stand
upriirht. A druggist recommend-
ed Chamberlain' Colic, Cholera
and Diarrhoea Remedy. The Hint
dose relieve ! me mid within two
days I wa as well as ever." Ma
ny druggists recommend this
remedy because tuey know that-
it is reliable. Obtainable every
where.

Carlyle on War.
Herald-Courier.
Thomas Carlyle's ideas regard
ing war as set forth in "Sartor
Resartus," doubtless will appear
a trifle old-fashioned to some
people ot this day and time. Nev
ertheless, they are and always
will be worth recalling and con
sidering. Many will find them es
pecially interesting , just now,
when Europe is bathed iu the
blood of men, and sorrow and
suffering stalk through tbe con
tinent when American swashbuck
lers are rattling their rusty sa
bres, and jingoes are raising their
raucous voices in bellicose blus
ter, all seeking to force the only
great nation at peace to take up
tho sword. Here is what Carlyle
said of war;
"What, speaking in quite un
official language, is the pur
port an I upshot of war? To my
knowledge, for example, there

ertheless, amid such weeping and
swearing, they are selected; all

at tho public charges, some 2,-

south of Spain, and fed there un

"And now, to that same spot,
