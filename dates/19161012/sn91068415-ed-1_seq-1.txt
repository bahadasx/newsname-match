in Evening with i Nature
Beautiful Picture Pained
By an October Sunset
: Did you; see that beautiful sun
set Sunday evening? If not you
missed a treat; no master artist
could half-ways do it j ustice. There
may have been many just as pretty
settings before but we have never
seen them. Colors! ah, my, what
a beautiful assortment so harmoni
ously blending themselves together.
Settiogs! - magnificent, glorious.
grand! No human hand helped to
fashion the wonderous beauties un
folded to the ee it Was the work
of the great master painter aided
by the angelic hosts a picture as
it were of paradise-of the great
and eternal beyond we call heaven.
Here was a great city laid off.
stretching across the western hori
zon with its streets of gold, inlaid
with pearl, the buildiogs of sapphires
and rubies, the lakes- and , rivers of
indescribable blue, the parks and
boulevards with their beautiful
foliage dyed in heaven's prettiest
green while the Walk ways were
studded with precious stones. Here
and there could be seen the white
robed hopts of the redeemed, their
harps of gold, their crowns the col
ors" of the rainbow and their wings
dipped in the lakes of gold and sil-
ver. vnoes were gliding here and
there along the placid streams of
golden waters, made so by the re
flection of the mighty October sun
ere it took the evening's departure
to the other side of the world per
haps it was the true and faithful
landing their frail barks in the ha
ven of refuge and rest or to the red
man's happy hunting grounds. Never
such colors displayed in anything,
earthly, the various shades of red.blue
green, yellow ah, what a picture
for the lover of nature to gaze upon!
srpiv this was a reflection of the
eternal home where our loved ones
dwell!
The same evening as the moon
came from among the erstwhile gol-
dea clouds and- oast a ailveryv beam
over1 myriads of smaller clouds
another beautiful scene greeted the
eye and caused" one to linger long
over the wonderful nature paintmg,
enacted on this beautiful October
evening.
"Where Are fly Children"?
This is the subject of the greatest
five-reel motion picture of its kind
the editor ever saw, and it's coming
to The Broadway Theatre Thursday
and Friday, Oct. 26 and 27th. We
hone everv husband and wife es-
pecially will see it and to those who
are inclined to abhor motherhood it
i narticularly suited, tven cur
children should know of the bless
hns of lawful motherhood at the
nrooer age. lest some of them grow
up in ignorance and be swept off of
their feet by the devil in sneep's
clothes. Too often has our seeming
jy modesty kept us from revealing
the great nature truth in a way our
children should understand it and
too often have we paid the price of
a false modestv. We need more
such pictures so the present and
r.nmmg generations can see tnem.
Manager Wagner of the Broadway
wanted the picture passed upon oy
citizens of High Point before book
ing it and be selected as a Board. of
Censorship Messers. J. 1. currus,
Geo. A. Matton, W. N. Keener aud
J. P. Rawley of the Enterprise and
W. L Stamey of The Review and

And this expresses tne sentiment
exactly of all present ' Saturday to

WANT OIL ASPHALT
Citizens of East Washington
street signed a petition requesting
that oil asphalt be used instead of
lake like designated on other streets
of the city as they could see no rea
son why they should pay 10c a yard
more for something considered no
better than the cheaper m price
kind.
In fact we think it would be a
good idea for the city to decide on
oil asphalt altogether and cut out
the worry of trying to use two kinds,
alike will save by it. . . ,
