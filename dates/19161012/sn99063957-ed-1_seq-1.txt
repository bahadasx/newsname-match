With the French Armies South of the
.Sommf, Oct. 12. Drawing their encircl
ing noose in from the west, north and
southwest, the. French have advanced
their lines at several points to within a
few hundred yards of the important
town of Chaulues.
The town was nlrendy seriously men
aced by the French advance ou Tues
day where German positions were taken
on a three mile tront. The rreucli are
pocketing it in the. same niffDiicr in
which the allies drove the Germans out
of Combles.
(Chaulues, to a certain extent, holds
the same important relation to the Ger
man lino south of tho bouiuae as did
Combles north of the river. It is a point
of support, the junction of several im
portant highways, and its capture will
enable the French to dominate the sur
rounding country for several miles.)
Aeriul torpedoes and secretly dug
trenches gave wonderful aid to the
French iu their movement to encircle
Chaulues. On Monday I visited the first
line trenches near Denic.ourt (three
miles northeast of Chaulues) to watch
preparations for tho great attack

Braves Field, Boston, Muss., Oct. 12.
Heforo the greatest crowd that over
witnessed a professional bull gamo, tho
Boston lied Sox annexed their fourth,
world's chnmpiunship this afternoon. A
vast throng, numbering 42,6-0 wild
oyed funs saw the Sox down tho Brook
lyn Dodgers, four to one, in the' fifth
game, of the 19111 titlo tussle.
It registered tho Sox' fourth victory
and clinched the titlo for them. T
Krnie Shore,, elongated right hamlet of
the Sox, wen t the honor of stowing a
way the championship. He is tho only
pitcher to be credited with two victor
ies in tho series. -.
The titlo clash, iu addition to furn
ishing the longest world's champion
ship game on record in tho 14 inning
tussle here Monday, was also one of
the richest in history. The receipts for
today's gamo alone were N3,H73, and
the total receipts for the five games
were 38.r,.r!K).f)0. Of this amount each
club received 92,0")2.20, as its share.
The nntional commission reaped a to
tal of :is,551).05. The players share wa
$1(12,1)27,451. Sixty per cent of this
goes to Boston and forty per cent to
Brooklyn to bo divided among the p!ay
crs eligible for tho series in such man
ner as the players themselves see fit.
Today 's game did not measure up to
the crowd. At best it was only ordinary
and in some plnces it was weird. Tho
great crowd really diun't turn-itself
looso until the gamo was over. Thous
ands thcu flooded down on the diamond
in the wako of a band which loudly
tooted "TcBsio" and after marching
around the field, massed in front of
the players bench to shout itself out.

dreds stood, pushing and jostling u

not a vacant sent in the imnicnso grand

was in the air passed somewhat during
the afternoon, but overcoats for tho
male funs and furs for the womou woro
in order. ...
To win hU game Shore turned in one
of .tho best games lie has pitched all

Battling on the brink of another

oozing with confidence.
The Red Box have proved themselves
