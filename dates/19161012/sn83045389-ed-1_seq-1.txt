after his return from bis conference orj

Although the secretary declined to
elaborate on bis statement, other offi

1 <i'Jestions, will be consulted. The
j board was called into session Imme
diately after the U-boat appeared on

( "-ies Again to-day it was stated posi
tively at the State Department that no
repi esentations of any sort had been
received from tin- allies as a result of
the | -.,rs visit to Newport, or her
I depredations off the American coast.
Kvlderice is accumulating to indicate
that, in case the actual operations ??f
| submarines in the Western Atlantic is
unified by the principles . >f Interia
"f>nal law. their prcscnee off the co.,st
will not be considered offensive, as u as
the case of the allied cruisers whi.-h
the United States asked to have wlth
drawn earlier in the war. Olliclals
! polntefl out to-day that the allied ves
| sels were only a few miles off land,
j while the U-boat operations were at
least fifty miles off the nearest land
and seventy miles from the mainland,
j It is realized, however, that should a
i practical blockade of American ports
| develop the covernment would con*
| sider it had grounds for action.
The character and rights of Ameri
j can cargo on hoard the ships already
sunk also is a subject that is being
considered by the State Department.
If it is decided that the ships were
sunk legally, there is considerable
doubt as to how far American shippers
can go in pressing for damages from
Germany. if iite ships were sunk
illegally, lulls for indemnity can be
I entered.
Naval experts are perplexed at the
absolute silence surrounding the U-53
since her foray ..ff Nantucket. Many
j ollicers believe now that she was sent
over 011 an experimental raid, to try
out her cruising capacities, to test her
i powers of destruction here and to de
velop the attitude of the United Stat.*
in a diplomatic sense.

NIOW VOI1K, October 11.?James w.
Gerard. United States ambassador to
Germany, who returned here yesterday
on his first vacation in nearly three
years, issued a formal statement late
to-day in which he denied that his
home coming had been caused by the
need of warning the administration at
Washington of Germany's intention to
resume indiscriminate submarine war
fare against neutral, as well as hostile
shipping. The amhassador's statement
follows:
"You may say that it Is not true that
I came home at I his time to serve no
tice on the President of the intention
of Germany to repudiate her pledge
regarding the conduct of submarine
warfare, or that Germany was contem
plating the resumption of submarine
attacks upon all kinds of shipping.
"I say to you. what I said to a re
porter for the Herliner Tageblatt. at
Copenhagen before I sailed: I should
not think of leaving my post at this
rime if I were not convinced that the
relations between my country.and Ger
many wore as frlc.nily as they could
he. and gave every promise of continu
ing so indefinitely."

Xl-:w YOlMv, October 11.?Although
j there was no news to-day to indicate
j that the German submarine f-MS was
still lurking in the Atlantic lanes, and
while some shippers believe she has
| headed for home, there was evidence
that the Jititish Admiralty will pro
ceed with caution in allowing ISritlsh
ships to depart from Atlantic coasi
ports.
Two vessels due t:> .-ail to-da> did
not leave, and it was reported that
"thers who have cleared, both French
and ISritish. will not sail at present,
j The passenger liner Adriatic. White

on \\ cdnesdt y. Kates were quoted at
" 1 *- Prr ct?t ?'< drop of .".ft per cent
from the general flotations earlier in

There was a strong tendency in naval

unless that craft has received fresh
fuel supplies on this side of the Atlan

for her base ;>i Helgoland. This belief
is f-ojii led oil the knowledge that the

liONOOX, Oclohcr 11. ? Vico-Admiral
P.irtlge du Fourtiet. commander <>f tlic i
Anglo-French fleet in the Mediter
ranean. lias presented an ultimatum to
Greece. demanding that tit-eece band
over the entire Greek fleet, except the
I armored cruiser Avoroff and the bat-!
tleshlps I.emnos and K ilkls. to the
entente allies by I o'clock Wednes
day afternoon, according to (tenter's
: Athens correspondent.
i Demand is also made for the control
of the Piraeus-!.arissa railway.
"The Minister of Marine." the corre
spondent continues, "says Vice-Admiral
j tin Fournct's demands will he complied
j with, and thai the feet will he handed
.over before the proscribed time.
I "The demands wore ntariis as a pre
I cautionary measure to insure the safety
' of the allies' fleet."
It is explained that the dispatch of
i artillery and ammunition to the in
! terlor, the movements of CSrcek ships
j and the continued activity of the re
servist leagues have aroused fears of
| a disturbance of order at points where
allies' war vessels are anchored, and
also endanger the security of the allied
, troops on the Balkan front.
Vice-Admiral do Fournet demands
! iho disarming of the Kilkis. I.emnos
land AverolT and the dlsninntling of the
' forts on the soacoast. while the two
forts commanding the fleet's moorings
are to he made over to the- admiral
I'ontrol of certain points must also
he placed In the hands of the Anglo
French authorities.
In addition to the disarming of the
| warships named, their crews are to he
reduced to one-third the regular com
' plement.
The Ciriiok navy consists of live bat
tleships. i lie Is ilkls. I.emnos. l'sara.
Spelsai and Hydra: one armored
cruiser, the Avoroff: the coast-defense
ship Itasileus Goorgios: the cruisers
llelli and Xnuarclios Miaulis: ten gun
boats. seventeen torpedo-boat de
stroyers, nine torpedo-boats, three siih
' marines and several transports and
other craft. The (5reek nc val force
has been estimated at 1. bin ofllcers and
men.
Itecently there have been reports that
Greek warships bad deserted the navy
and joined the revolutionary f-?rce?.
I Among these were the battleship llvdra
? and two torpedo boats, which It was
declared had left their anchorages and
joined the allied fleet In Salamis Hay.
The Kilkis also was reported to have
deserted. I>111 this was denied.
The best ships In the t'Sroek navy
are the Kilkis ami I.emnos. which re
spectively are the former American
battleships Itlaho and Mississippi.
These vessels wore sold to 15recce in
It'll, Greece paying % 12,riS.">,2T?? for
them. The llelli also is an American
built ship, having been constructed by
the New York Shipbuilding Company
as the Fei Hung for China, and pur
chased by Greece in HUI.
Some of the smaller craft was cap
tured from Turkey in I *>!'?.
At the outbreak of the war. '.recce
had two Iireadnoimhl - under construc
tion. tine in France and the other in
? Germany, and a protected cruiser build
ing in ICnglaud.
! It is probable tliat the dispatch to
lteuter's correspondent was delayed in
j transmission from Athens to l.ondon.
