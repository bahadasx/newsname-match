And we must say that we do not know of any man with higher :
ideals or more pure motives than Hon Argus Cox. We
have known hltn as a Lawyer, and, of his judgeship for
many years. And as a Minister of the Gospel, wo
iry to observe the principles set forth by men
onthebench, inorder to meet out justice to
those whom justice belongs to. And for
this reason we believe whoever casu
their vote for Hon. Argus Cox. will
oast their vote for a man worthy
of their support.
