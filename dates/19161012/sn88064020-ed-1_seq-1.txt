ARRESTS NEAR IN THEFIT
OF $13,600
Following several important clues
Monday morning, the police expect
soon to make arrests in connection
with the theft of $13,600 from a
safe in the residence of Frank Daly.
aged 54, of 231 Atlantic avenue, 3
some time during Saturday night or
early Sunday morning. a
Daly. retired from active business c
life. inherited the money on the
death of his mother some time ago.
and according to his own admission, r
had the money in an old iron safe in I
a room adjoining his bedroom where- a
he lived alone, and that the safe
door was never locked because he f
did not know the combination. The
thief therefore found no difficulty r
in getting the money once he had
forced an entrance.
What the police are puzzled over,
however, is the fact that in gaining v
an entrance, the burglar was com
pelled to force open two doors. That e
Daly was not aroused from his slum- a
bers is considered remarkable, since a
in forcing the two doors, the robber n
had to throw his weight against each n
with sufficient force to bend the h
bolts. d
Daly insists, however, that the v
money was in the safe when he re
tired Saturday night at 10 o'clock, a
and that it was gone when he looked d
for it Sunday morning. ti
Daly said the money was in de
nominations of $10 and $20 bills.

ry his car Sunday night when trouble in
at the shape of Jack Smith, negro,
og bounded on to the car platform be
[0- side him.
er The negro, Conductor Boyer says,
did not offer to pay a nickel. In
of stead, the black man grabbed the tt
it register cord and rang up half a
lrl dozen fares. di
"I'm doin' this to save you trou
ce ble," the negro is quoted as explain- V
rluing to the conductor.
' Then, he gave the motorman one s

t0 bowed himself away into the dark
