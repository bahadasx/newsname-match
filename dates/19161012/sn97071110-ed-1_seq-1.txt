LOCAL WOMAN IS
PIONEER OF '52
MRS. McGUIRE TELLS EXPERIENCES
Aged Woman Now Busy With Needle Pre
paring Christmas Presents For
Her Friends
' Friends of Mrs. Maria McGuire.aged
84 and a pioneer of 1852, tbe year of
the largest immigration to Oregon.will
find ber busy making Cbristmss pres
ents. And the gifts, you msy be sure,
arV always prised by those who receive
thsm. Following the eustom of years,
Mrs. MeGuire begins months before
the Yuletide season to prepsre dainty
treasures for ber favored friends and
relatives. She uses tbe sheerest of
materials and the finest of needles.
Mrs.McGuire learned those nest stitch
es; such as cannot be equaled by any
machine, when a child in an early day
private school. Her needlework is tbe
wonder of all who know her.
Twenty-live yean ago Mrs. Mcuuire
and her husband, the late Joseph Me
Guire, who passed away on Match 24,
1900, retired from the hotel business
st McMinnvjlle, where for many years
they bad been located, and oame here
seeking health for tbe latter. They
built a borne on Cascade avenue, then
not much more than trail. Mrs. Me
Guire has seen Hood River grow from
a population of a few hundred souls to
progressive city, and today a pavea
street, tbe Hood River extension of
the Higbwsy, passes her door. And
last year, when the great scenic high
way was, officially opened, no Hood
Kiver man or woman was more enthus
iastic than Mrs. MeGuire. as ahe sat
on her front porch ana waved at tne
party of prominent men of the state
who formed the first party touring up
the Columbia s gorge. Among tne men
coming over the Highway was State
treasurer 1 nomas is. Kay, an old time
friend and former neighbor of the Ore
gon pioneer woman.
'While 1 have lived to see much.
says Mrs. MeGuire. "having witnessed
the transformation of . methods of
transportation, having watched tbe in
stallation of everything that brings
modern convenience to my home, 1 be
lieve I have lived 60 years too soon.
My first journey down the Columbia.
just 64 years ago, required more time
thao a transcontinental trip takes to
day. But it is a journey I will never
forget. Uften i recall tbe site or Mood
River. In 1852 it waa an unbroken ex
panse of oak trees covering the eloping
canyonside. Hood river was called
uog river, utile aid i realize, as wun
my family 1 made my way slowly
down the great stream on a natboat.
that some day 1 would ait here watch
ing the rushing limited trains of two
transcontinental lines and the magnifi
cent steamboats that have supplanted
the old flatboat. As for tbe Columbia
River Highway, it must have been a
vision of every pioneer who traveled
down the Columbia in tbe early days.
The journey was made extremely dim
cult by the portage at the cascades and
the negotiation of the treacherous rap
ids below. I remember at this point
we lost our chest of silver, containing
the family crest,
Mrs. MeGuire. whose maiden name
was Maria Moore, was born at Toronto,
Canada, January 24, 1832. The family
set out for Oregon, after reading stor
ies of the great land of opportunity, in
1852. crossing Lake Ontario to uuttaio,
N. Y. Across Lake Michigan tney
traveled by boat to Milwaukee. Mrs,
Mcuuire was of a family of eight cmi-
dren, four boys and four girls. The
day before the journey was begun her
oldest hrotber, urawfora Moore, was
married, and the ox-cart journey across
the plains was his honeymoon trip.
This brother while en route gave up
the nlans of soma to Oregon and leav
ine the family of his fsther. proceeded
to Salt Lake. Utah. Later he settled
in Kansas.
The journey across the continent con
sumed six months, the party arriving in
Portland November 6, 1852. roruana
was then but little more than a village
'The stumps of big trees could be
seen in the streets." says Mrs. Mc
Guire. "All buildings were little one
story frame structures. The sign of
the Oregomsn was seen attached to one
of these little buildings. My fsther
immediately subscribed for the paper
From that time to this i nave oeen a
resular reader of the Oregoman. To
day 1 would rather go on two meals a
dsv than to forego my morning paper."
The long trip was a nara ana teaious
one, according to tee sioiy or tne agea
pioneer. But 14 miles of railway naa
been constructed in the state of Wis
consin, and none in lowa. ine party
passed through Lies Moines ana L-eoar
Kaoids. Ia.. then mere villages, and
the greater portion of the fertile area
of western Iowa was vacant, wun oniy
an occasional building or small settle
ment. A short distance before - the
Missouri river was reached the party
passed through the Mormon settlement
of Kanesvine.
"At that time." says Mrs. MeGuire.
tbe Mormons were abandoning this
point and leaving for Utah. We did
not see a single building where today
Omaha is located. From that point
until we reached Fort Laramie on the
North Platte we did not see a building,
The entire country was occupied by
Pawnee and Sioux Indians and at all
times we had to guard our horses
closely. At one place we were detained
for an entire day. while a herd con
taining thousands and thousands of
buffalo crossed our path, rrom fort
Laramie we proceeded to Fort Hall,
then a trading post located on what
now tbe rort nan inoian reservation
not far from Pocatello. Tbe trail then
lay along the south side of the Snake
river. Following this trail for about
40 miles without food or water for our
stock, we finally reached a point where
the bank was low enough for us to
descend and give the famished animals
drink. The sound of tbe water rushing
over Shoeshone falls some distance be
low could be plainly heard,
"Here occurred our first tragedy,
There was no feed for the stock on tbe
south side of the river, but wild grass
waa growing luxuriantly on the op
posite side. My brother, C. W. Moore,
snd another boy were instructed to
drive the animals across the river. In
carrying out their task they reached
deep water. My brother managed to
get across, but his companion was
caught in the whirlpool and drowned
Mv brother was left alone on the op
oosite side of the river with about 300
head of stock. It would have been ira
possible for him alone to have herded
them together "and have driven them
back across tbe stresm. One of the
older men of the party gathered a
cumber of pieeea of drift wood and
fashioned a rude skiff, thus crossing
tbe river to help bim.
"I shsll never forget that tragedy.
The mother of the dead lad was lying
in a wagon at our side of the stream
nursing a week old infant boy. A
search was made for the body of tbe
victim, but we could not find it, and
yet it waa necessary for us to push on.
We learned later that a train follow
ing oura about three days saw the re
mains of the poor boy lodged on rocks,
at Salmon falls.
At Salmon falls we found another
party that had preceded us. They
were very much excited over the mur
der of one of their men by the Indisna,
as they thought, ihey asked us to
assist in a aearcb for the guilty per
son. In the pursuit it was soon found
the tracks of but a single man were in
the wet sand. The shoes had nails in
tbe soles of them, and it waa decided
that the murderer must have been a
white man. A man, who bad formerly
been a member of the train we Ihad
overtaken but had left early on the
morning following the tragedy, waa
shortly .overtaken. Found guilty, the
man wss sentenced to oe snot. A cap
was placed over his bead, and men,
some armed with loaded rifles and
others with guns containing blanks.
were ordered to execute bim. When
tbe prisoner waa ordered to stand up
be did so, but began to run. Then
turning, he cried, '1 will not die run
ning.' He fell as he uttered tbe cry.
The bodies of the murderer and bis
victim were placed in the same grave.
1 might add that tbe murderer was
given a fair trial by jury.
we reached 1 he Dalles during the
last days of October. We had run out
of flour three days before our arrival,
my father bavins used up much of our
supply in feeding our oxen on huge
slices of bread with chunks of salt
pork in between. The food was given
as a remedy for some kind of poisoning
that had attacked the animals wbile
they were crossing the plains. Before
we arrived at Tbe Dalles my mother
walked three miles ahead of the train
to secure some of the precious food
material. Before returning she had
baked some buttermilk breed, and it
was well, for my youngest brother,
tormented by tbe pangs of hunger, was
crying for food when she arrived again
in camp.
"The snows had already closed the
trail to the Willamette valley to the
south of Mount Hood. Wo left all of
our stock at Tbe Dalles to be wintered.
Because of tbe severe weather every
last one of them perished.
A portage railroad, the cars drawn
by mules. w.s in operation at tbe cas
cades. The road, 1 think, was built
snd operated by Putnam and Daniel
Bradford, who with Capt. Ainsworth
ami others built and operated the first
steamboats on the Upper Columbia. "
The Moore family crossed to Oregon
City, where they remsined for a short
time, tha father later filing on a dona
tion land claim seven miles from Sa
lem. The wedding of Mr. aDd Mrs.
MeGuire occurred in 1853.
Rev. Boone, a pioneer Methodist
minister, whose home was on Boone
Island at Salem, officiated," says Mrs,
MeGuire. "The Oregon legislature was
in session in a nine nouse next aoor,
and at Rev. Boone's request, all of
the legislators were invited in to wit
ness the ceremony.
1 have a book telling of tbe pioneer
history of the Methodist church and
giving biographical sketches of many
of the pioneer ministers. When I grow
lonesome 1 take the book and read it
over, nearly all of the men at one
time or another preached at the little
log cabin home of my father."
Mr. and Mrs. Mcuuire resided first
st Oregon City, where Mr. MeGuire, a
miller by profession, could follow his
trade. Because of his poor health they
took up a donation claim three miles
east of Amity. For 25 years they lived
there, developing their fertile tract.
Then renting the farm to their oldest
son, they went to McMinnville to take
up the botel business.
rs. Mcuuire is known tar ana wiue
for her hospitality as a hostessand for
her famous cooking. The hotel at Mc
Minnville became the center of social
life there, and many were the balls, the
banquets and the dinners that were
given. Mrs. MeGuire, wbile she spends
the summers at her home here, goes
each winter either to California or tbe
Willamette valley. During every sea
son spent at the latter point she is fre
quently encountering some old time
friend of tbe days when she keptftne
hotel. Last winter with her daughter,
Mrs. Laura Baldwin, who lives with
her mother. Mrs. MeGuire was spend
ing the winter in Salem. They spent
one day at tne nooie of Hon. wiinam
Galloway.
"The taste of those delicious wild
blackberry pies and other Igood things
you used to cook, Mrs. Mcuuire, will
never cease from my memory," de
clared Mr. Galloway during the day of
the visit.
On a lot adjoining the home place of
his mother here H. C. MeGuire several
years ago built a home. He has aince
moved to Portland.
While the family of W. B. Mc
Guire, another of my sons, still lives
here," says Mrs. MeGuire, "I miss my
other boy and bis son, Leslie, whose
antica and songs on the lot next door
always held an interest for me. He
used to come ana sing for me. tie
was known while here, you know, as
the mehtiniale of Hood River.
to Mr. and Mrs. MeGuire were born
11 children, all of whom survive with
the exception of Mrs. Frances Ward,
who passed away in 1902 in California,
The other children are: Walter B,
MeGuire and Mrs. Laura Baldwin, of
Hood River: Huner C. MeGuire, Ches

Portland; George H. MeGuire, of Col

of Lsurel, and Mrs. Anna B. Lewis,
of Zion City. III.
"1 do not believe that a woman sur
vives in the Northwest," says Mrs,
MeGuire. "who has done more work
than I have done. I believe, when we
crossed the continent, that 1 with
other young members of .the party,
walked at least two tbirda of the die
tance. The oxen were too slow for us
and we would congregate and walk
ahead of the main party. Yet I feel
that I am happier, atronger and sturdi
er for the experience. Now, after
crossing tbe four score mark, tbe one
thing that worries me most is that I
cannot find enough work todo."

FRAUD ALLEGED
IN COMPLAINT
JUDGE STANTON IS A DEFENDANT
Judge Derby Proceeds Against Associated
Fruit Growers to Protect Mi
nority Stockholders
Operating under the provisions ef tha
Blue Sky law on behalf of minority
stockholders District Attorney Derby
Saturday afternoon filed a complaint
tbe circuit court asking that a re
ceiver be appointed for tbe Associated
rruit urowers. a corporation, accord-
ng to the allegations, fraudulently
formed in the fall of 1914 :bv County
Judge Stanton and R. F. Marquis for
the alleged purpose of defrauding in
nocent purchaneis of stock.
Judge btanton and wife. Laura E.
Stanton, and Mr. Marquis and wife,
Kate. Marquis, as directors of tbe
company, and Ralph J. Jarvis, are in
cluded as defendants. A decree of
foreclosure of a purchase price mort
gage for $5,500 against a 10 acre tract
was granted Mr. Jarvis last week by
Judge Bradshaw holding a session of
circuit court here. The complaint asks
that Mr. Jarvis, who now has posses
sion of the property and who is adver
tising for its sale, be required to give
an accounting of tbe 1916 apple crop.
It is further alleged that he has come
into possession of farming tools and
implements which were not includedin
the mortgage held by him.
According to the recitals of tbe com
plaint the defendants. Judge Stanton
and Mr. Marqus and their wives, con
ceived the idea of forming the corpora
tion on October at), 1914. The capital
stock was placed at 70.000 ; 7,000
shares of $10 each. Mr. Marquis, as
secretary.opened books for subscription
of stock, and shares were subscribed as
follows: Judge Stanton and Mr. Mar
quis a total of 4,640; Mrs. Stanton, one
share and Mrs. Marquis one share. The
four then elected themselves directors.
choosing officers as follows: Judge
Stanton, pres. ; Mrs. Stanton.vice pres. ;
Mr. Marquis, sec.-treas.
During the month of November, 1914,
according to tbe allegations, Judge
Stanton and Mr. Marquis caused to be
conveyed te the corporation three par
cels of land ownd by them and their
wives, receiving in payment the fully
paid up 4,640 shares of capital stock.
n addition to the tract, against which
the Jarvis mortgage was outstanding,
Judge and Mrs. Stanton transferred a
sceond 10 acres, against which C A.
Merriam and wife, of Eugene, held
a mortgage for $6,100. The holders of
this mortgage have already field fore
closure proceedings. Mr. and Mrs.
Marquis transferred a 30 acre tract,
against which a mortgage for $4,000 in
favor of the American-Scandinavian
Bank, of Astoria, waa outstanding. An
anticipation of foreclosure proceedings
in the case of the last mortgage is ex
pressed in the complaint.
According to the complaint the total
value of the real estate transferred by
tbe incorporators and officers of the
Associated Fruit Growers did not ex
ceed $20,000 at the time of the trans
fer.
The complaint further alleges that
the ownership of a single share of stock
each by Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Marquis
was colorable only for tbe furtherance
of the fraudulent enterprise, and the
court is asked to decree the husbands
in fact as owners of the two shares of
stock.
The court is asked to enjoin Judge
Stanton and Mr. Marquis from a fur
ther disposal of or placing of incum
brances on tbe stock unsold. For the
protection of the minority stockholders,
to whom, according to an exhibit at
tached to the complaint, 1,047 shares
have been sold, the court is asked to
require that Defendants Stanton and
Marquis be required to pay to tbe cor
poration thedifference between the ac
tual cash value of the real estate, less
incumberanceB, and par value of the
stock. If it is found that this cannot
be done or does not seem equitable to
the court, it is asked that all unsold
stock be cancelled and returned to the
court and that a judgment be entered
against Judge btanton ana Mr. Marquis
for the difference between the actual
value of the land less incumbrances
and tbe par value of stock disposed of.
It is stated in the complaint that Mr.
Marquis has removed from the jurisdic
tion of the court and that despite the
fact .that he has been notified of the
financial embarrassment of the corpor
ation, he pays no heed to such commun
ications. Mr. Marquis' residence at
the present time is said to be Bismark,
N. D.
It ia stated in the complaint that the
corporation has no lunds or credit with
which to purchase supplies for tne har
vest of apples and that a receiver be
empowered to take charge of these
matters for the interest of minority
stockholders.
Circuit Judge Bradshaw here from
The Dalles Monday especially to bear
the case, appointed E. N. Benson, a
West Side orcbardist, receiver for the
Associated Fruit Urowers. Geo. K.
Wilbur, attorney for Mr.Jarvis, agreed
to this prayer and stated to the court
that the crop would be severed from
tbe land and kept segreaggted.
County Judge Stanton was present.
He denied the allegation of the com
plaint to the effect that the Associated
Fruit Growers would not hsve been
able to harvest their crop.
We would have been able to have
nnanced the harvest of the crop had it
not been foi recent newspaper reports
telling of the probability of appoint
ment of a receiver," be declared.
Car Shortage Affects Box Deliveries
The csr shortage is affecting the har
vest of Hood River apples, in that it is
impossible to secure delivery of suffi
cient boxes on many orchard places to
care for the crop.
"We need 4,000 boxes at the Max
welton orchards on the East Side."
says E. N. Benson, msnager of tbe
place, "and I know of numerous other
ranchers who are not able to get their
orders on containers."
The Apple Growers Associstion states
that sufficient boxes have been ordered
but that tbe car shortsge mskes it diffi
cult to get them delivered here on time.
Growers, too, have underestimated
their crops, and the 1916 apple crop will
probably reach tbe million box mark.
Several weeks ago the tonnage was
placed at 900,000 boxes.
