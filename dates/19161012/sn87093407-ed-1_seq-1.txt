RUG LEADERS M
BITTER STRUGGLE
FOR SUPREMACY
Unafraid of police interference since being allowed
to operate in a wholesale manner, members of boot
legging syndicates have carried their feuds to the point
where gun play is expected hourly.
Thursday, following allegations of wholesale
thefts of each other's supplies and charges of tipping the
police, which came to light after ex-Patrolman E. J. Mar
gett's arrest and charges of police graft by Dry Squad
Leader Putnam, feeling was bitter.
Dozens of armed and well-paid confederates have
been working under the direction of four leaders, who
are conducting the four competing bootlegging syndi
cates.
Weeks ago, the leader of one gang, who is a widely
known sporting character, told Chief Beckingham that
they were "stealing each other's booze."
"I'm going to get the Margett plant across Lake
Washington if I can find it," he said. "I've got men
searching for it."
Rivalry between the Billlnicileya,
who, Sergt- Putnam »»>•, have nev
er atopped operating on a big acale
here. an<l Marwett, who vii atip
plled with all the working capital
he deaired by invisible Inventor*,
and who s waa auppoaed to know the
rope*, has been feethlng for week*
Blliingaley Stii Margett'* Attorney
Recause Margett and his hire
lings believe the Bllllngsleys laid
the trap for his arrest thru the.
"tips" given the police by two
truck drivers Tuesday night, threats
of Impending gunwork have b«en
current.
Ix>gan Rillingsley was seen to
visit Margett's lawyer. Jack Sulli
van. Wednesday afternoon.
Sullivan refused to admit the
visit.
The pair were closeted some
time, and in underworld circles It
la believed Rillingsley tried to con
vince Sullivan that he did not
"frame up" Margett's arrest.
Much Booxe Shipped In
Most of the booze has been sup
plied by the Jesse Moore Hunt Co .
of San Francisco, which has played
the game by helping evade the au
thorities. Papers seized by the po
lice have revealed the "understand
ing" between the wholesalers and
the bootleggers here, and Implicat
ed railway companies.
Carload lots have been rolling in
to Seattle steadily.
Fleets of 15 or 20 auto trucks,
with drivers and helpers trained to
work fast and evade dry squad of
ficers. carry the shipments from
cars, conveniently spotted, to se
cret warehouses or caches outside
the city.
Armed guards, said to be gun
men. are known to be on duty
guarding the bases of supply.
Solicitors make the rounds of
small bootlegging Joints, selling
wlilskv at fat prices. Dozens of
individual bootleggers peddle the
booze at from 12.50 to $.1 a quart,
retail. The same brands sold for
$1.25 or less before the state went
dry.
Eye witnesses say a sunlight be
tween rival factions nearly broke
out at Georgetown Tuesday morn
ing. whe« a carload of liquor arriv
ed there.
Two cars were due to arrive. One
was on the tracks. Both factions
claimed it. Margett's agents and
a rival Rang mixed verbally. Each
mln'ute there was danper of dry
squad officers arriving on the
ground.
The discussion suddenly ended
when one of the Rang drew a re
volver. and in an instant members
of both factions had whisked out
guns and were ready to settle the
argument.
Then one of the leader.! urged
arbitration, and the contents of the
car were divided equally.
