THE IMPORTANCE
OF PROPER SANI
TARY ENGINEERING
Given Consideration by the State
Board of Health
ADDS TO ITS EQUIPMENT
Department Under the Manage
ment of an Experienced Scien
tific Man Advisory Service
Free to Citizens of Florida
When the erection of a great
bridge spanning deep waters or
building of a sky scraper for the
housing of millions of dollars of
business interests is contemplated,
the first thing is to prepare plans
to the minutest details. The
character of the foundations, the
strength of the materials and
number-less other minutiae are
considered, and the work of the
engineer is the first and most im
portant of all.
It hasn't occurred to business
men, until within very recent
years, that the services of the en
gineer are quite as necessary in
the even more important work of
building up and conserving health
Uie physical welfare, the per
manent well-being of the commun
ity which is the foundation of all
its chances for prosperity.
Taking the lead and establish
ing precedents in its work for the
lasting betterment of the public
health in Florida, the State Board
of Health has quite recently added
to its equipment a Department of
Sanitary Engineering. Hardly
1hree months go this work was
inaugurated, under the manage
ment of an experienced scientific
man who has made special study
for years of the problems that af
fect the purity of the water sup-
i ply and the disposal of sewage in
Florida communities, whether
they be cities or rural districts.
Usually the body of citizens
who award contracts for the con
struction of municipal waterworks
and sewers know as much about
the elements of the problems, a-
, bout the dangers of improper
construction and maintainance as
they know about their abiding
place in the hereafter. Thel call
for advice from engineers who are
quite competent to estimate the
flow of water from given sources,
the cost of laying pipe and other
generalities, but they don't know,
or are indifferent as to whether
that water is fit to drink or wheth
er it may be contamiuated now or
hereafter from known or suspect
ed sources.
Too often, unscrupulous engin
l eis-and contractors will persuade
gullible municipal authorities into
unwise investments of public mon
ey in public improvements. Tak
ing advantage of incompetent in
spection of construction and ma
terials, a city may be rebbed of
large sums by imperfect and un
scientific workmanship and low
grade materials.
It is to remedy such possibilities
in Florida citios and sections, that
this new department has been cre
ated: it is for the benefit of cities
and towns and individuals. Like
a large share of the work of the
State Board of Health, the func
tions of the department are advi
sory and free to the citizense of
Florida.
The water supply of the eom
munit yis like the blood of the in
dividual if it isn't pure and
wholesome it becomes a poison.
The problem in each city and town
is a subject for special study for
it is not exactly alike in any two
places. The natural suorce of
water supply, whether that water
is wholesome chemically and pure
bacteriologieally,, whether and
how it may be contaminated and
how it may be kept perpetually
uncontaminated , are some of the
dements to be settled by scientific
investigation before construction
may be begun wisely or nafely.
The artesian water supply thru
the state is much the same as to
chemical content. Yet although
it comes from varying depths in
different sections, there is the pos
sibility in numerous places that
it may be polluted by drainage
from inhabited territory, to insure
clean water and keep it clean is
the province of the sanitary ex
pert. The construction and loca
tion of sewers and drains and the
disposal of garbage , and refuse
are subjects that call for most ser
ious study by scientific engineers,
and through this department the
State Board of Health offers ex
pert advice on these matters af
fecting public health. - '
Already the engineer in charge
is having made chemical examina
tions of water supplies. With the
establishment of its own labora
tory the department will soon be
prepared to make- bacteriological
examinations also.
While the services of this de
partment are advisory, it has al
ready surveyed without being
called especially into consultation,
the water supply and drainage of
several cities and reports are be
ing prepared on these investiga
tions. The department has and
will exercise the function of
independent sleuthing, and some
Florida communities may be sur
prised and shocked when they are
informed that they are drinking
and bathing in water that far be
low the surface is mixed in the
same cesspool with their sewage,
or that of some neighboring town,
miles away. State Board of

Program for Citrus Seminar
About Completed
The Seventh Annual Citrus
Seminar which will be held at the
Universiry of Florida, Octtober 17
to 20, promises to be the largest
meeting that has been held. The
program is about completed and it
is more comprehensive and con
tains a greater number of authori
ties find exhibits than that of any
previous meeting. Fertilizers,
standardizations of varieties and
nursery problems will be discuss
ed the first day. An attempt is be
ing made to obtain a noted speak
er to address the meeting on stan
dardization that day.
. The following morning, Wed
nesday, has been given over to the
discussion of marketing of citrus
fruits. Senator Duncan U. Fletch
er will address the growers that
morning on how citrus growers
can maks use of the Federal Farm
Loan Act. Citrus canker and e-
radication work will receive con
siderable attention during the af
ternoon and evening. Lvery grow
er should attend the session Wed
nesday since it will be one of
great importance to the industry.
Thursday and Friday will be
devoted to diseases and pests and
methods of control, especially by
spraying. M. B. Waite of the Bu
reau of Plant Industry will dis
cuss spraying machinery and e-
quipment Thursday afternoon
During his lecture-and following
it demonstrations will be made.
J. II. Watson, entomologist 'fo

Talking of Town Politics
The near.aproach of the town
election has set some citizens to
talking about the offices soon to
become vacant. The officials to
be chosen are a mayor, three coun
cilmen, marshal, treasurer, clerk
and assessor.. -
Thus far the street talk favors
the reelection of Ed. Smith for
mayor, J. II. Lipscomb for mar
shal, L. E. Robinson for clerk and
E. W. Rountree for treasurer.
The terms of Aldermen Silcox,
Trabuo. and Fries are expiring.
Walt mire and Whitten hold over.
As successors to the three men
who retire, the following are
spoken of: R. C. Blount, T. C.
Crosland, Harry Botts and R. E.
Doty. ,
The colunms of The Horald are
open for announcements at .t'2.50
each.
The President's simple porch
campaign and Mr. Hughes elabor
ate itineraries throughout the
country appear to form a combi
nation that will prove the undoing
of the Republicans.
Austrian arch-dukes are being
rapidly separated from their high

SUPREME COURT
DECISION WAS END
OF THE CONTEST
For Democratic Nomination as
as Governor of Florida
KNOTTISPEOPLES NOMINEE
Is Endorsed by the State Execu
tive Committee in Resolutions
- Adopted at the Late Meeting
Held in Jacksonville
The long, bitter "contest to de
cide who was nominated for gov
ernor in the June primary was fi
nally decided on Saturday last in
favor of Win. V. Knott. In fact,
it was decided by the Democratic
voters on June 6th; but owing to
many errors in counting and tabu
latig the votes in the various coun
ties, it took a long, acrimonious
and expensive contest to deter
mine definitely who had received a
majority of both first and second
choice votes.
The final hearing in the supreme
court last Saturday resulted in
that" tribunal refusing to order
the state canvasing board to make
a third canvass that would include
the sixty-nine votes cast for Mr.
Catts in precinct No. 3 of Alachua
county and the corrected returns
from Hilsborough and other coun
ties, these returns being in favor
of Mr. Knott. Thus the renuest
of the attorneys for each contes
tant was denied; otherwise, if
both had been granted, Mr, Knott
would have been shown to be the
nominee by thirty-six to forty
eight majority. As it was and is,
the second re-canvass by the state
ty-op" majority and the certificate
board which gave Mr. Knott twen
of nomination, holds good, and he
is the de jure as well as the de fac
to nominee of the Democratic par
ty, for governor of Florida.
At the same time that the su
preme court was delivering its
final decision, the Democratic
state executive committee in ses
sion at Jacksonville, by a vote of
31 to 10, adopted the following
resolutions:
"Whereas, the rule and provi
sions of the primary election law
particularly with respect to the
counting of the second choice
votes were not generally under
stood by the inspectors of elec
tions in the recent .primary in
which candidates of the Democra
tic party were nominated; and
"Whereas, many errors were
unintentionally made by the in
spectors in several of the counties
of this.State in tabulating and tal
lying such votes; and
"'Whereas, it has been judicial
ly determined by the courts of this
State, after full and impartial in
vestigation of the contest for the
Democratic nomination lor gov
ernor that the Honorable V. V.
Knott is justly entitled to such
nomination; and
"Whereas, the high character
and ability and integrity of the
judges of the Supreme Court and
the other courts of the State of
Florida is such as to commend the
confidence and respect of every
fair minded citizen of this state,
"Now, therefore, be it
"Resolved, by the Democratic
Executive Committee of the State
of Florida, that the action of the
Honorable W. V. Knott in insti
tuting and carrying to a conclu
sion the recount contest in the
courts for the purpose of judicial
ly determining the true Democrat
ic nominee for governor, was nec
esary in order to properly protect
and secure the rights of the indi
vidual Democratic voters of Flor
ida. Be it further
"Resolved, that the State Dem
ocratic Executive Committee
heartily endorses all of the' Dem
ocratic nominees, national, State
and county, and does hereby
nledtre to lovally support the
said nominees in the ensuing elec
tion. "Be it further resolved, that all
Dpmnri-ats in the State of Florida
should irivn their active aid and
support towards the election of all
said Democratic nominees and
thereby continue the supremacy
of the Democratic party. ie u
further
Resolved, that all nominees of
the Democratic party in the recent
primary election are particularly
called upon to lend their aid and

But No Gains Reported
Newport, R. I. Eyewitness
stories of the torpoeding of pas
senger and freight steamers by
German submarines off Nantucket
were told here Monday.
According to a report brought
by officers of a flotilla of United
States destroyers , which picked
up passengers and crews of sever
al of the vessels destroyed, nine
merchant sips were sunk.
One of the submarines is sup
posed to have been the U-53
which visited this harbor Satur
day and another was declared to
be the U-61. "
Six vissels are known to have
been sunk and the report that the
total was nine was based on
statement of the captain of the
Nantucket Shoals lightship. The
captain said three . submarines
were engaged. The list of subma
rine victims included four Brit
ish, one Norwegian and one Dutch
vessel. The identity of the other
three reported to have been lost,
had not been learned early today
The crews of all the vessels with
the exception of one were brought
hero together with the eighty-
passengers, and were cared for by
the officers of the Narragansett
Bay Naval Station and prominent
members of the Newport summer
colony.
It was believed that no lives had
been lost and although the men of
one freighter were reported adrift
m open boats the fact that the
weainer was mua and the sea
calm, made it seem probable that
they would bo rescued.
Of the passengers, thirty were
American tourists returning from
A'cwloundland and the Canadian
maritime provinces.
Lieutenant Commander Miller
of the Ericsson, jvhich picked up
some of the boats, said that no at
tack was made on the vessels un
til all on board had left.
active support and assist in the
candidacy of Woodrow Wilson for
president, W. V. Knott for trover
nor and R. F. Taylor for justice of
the Supreme Court, and Hon.
Frank Clark for Congress, for the
reason that the Democratic candi
dates last above named are being
subjected to violent attacks by in
dependents, Republicans, Social
lists and other enemies, of the
Democratic party, and it is the
sense of this committee, speaking
for the organized Democracy for
the State of Florida, that alf such
nominees should properly respond
to all requests hereafter made up
on them by the Campaign Com
mittee, to give active aid and, sup
port in the present campaign."
It may safely be claimed that,
if there had.becn a correct recount
of the vote of the entire state, it
would have shown Mr. Knott to
be several hundred votes in the
lead. It should be remembered
in his favor that, when evidence
presented caused him to doubt
the integrity of the recount in
Madison county, he declined to re
ceive a large number of votes to
which that recount showed him t
be entitled. . j
It now behooves cverj' resil
Democrat to fall in line and do all
that he can to carry out the will
of a majority of Hie people by c
iecting Mr. Knott governor of
Florida.
Moan time. Mr. CatH k running
as an independent and a prohibi
tionist, thus having bolted the
Democratic party.
Newspapers to Advanse Rates
t ""
A special meting of the State
Press Association was held in
Jacksonville last Saturday and
Friday to consider the problem of
mectin the increased cost of pub
lication caused by the great ad
vance in the price of print paner
and all other printing material.
After considerable discussion, it
was decidely that is was absolute
ly necessary for all standard
weekly papers (such as The Her
ald 8 pages, 6 columns; to, ad
vance their subscription rates to
$2.00 a year, all others of smaller
size to $1.50 a ,year the increased
rate to go into effect ,Jany. 1st,
1917.
The minimum price of adver
tising space in all weeklies,, re
gardless of size or circulation was
fixed at 20c. per single-coumn
inch . no reduction to be made in
favor of plate or stereotyped mat
ter.
No rates were prescribed for
dailies, which was a serious over
sight, and nothing was said or
done about the establishment of a
paper mill in Jacksonville. The
.inevitable banquet and the meet
ing on Saturday of the Democratic
state eommittee appears to have
caused the association' to neglect
these matters, but the Souths Flor
ida Association, which is a real
business concern can be depended
on to give them some attention at
the semi-annual meeting in Lake-
and in January.
The DeSoto Couty Association
will take action at an early date.
Burning Trash From Fields Makes
Poor Land
The" easiest way to get rid of
trash and crop remains is by fire.
This is also the easiest means of
destroying the fertility of the
and. Florida soils need the or
ganic matter wrucn tins ruDDisn
will supply. In most cases this
material will not increase the fer
tility when it is returned to the
soil on which it grew. ' It will
merely tend to maintain that fer
tility. If it is burned, most of the
plant food will be lost and the
farmer will have nothing but poor
and to show for the crop which
produced tho material.
S. S. Walker, associate chemist
to the University of Florida Ex
periment Station, cites another
important office of - the organic
matter. This material furnishes
food upon which the beneficial
organisms live. Ihey not only
break down the organic matter in
their feeding processes, but they
aid materially in liberating other
plant foods from the mineral con
stituents of the soil. Organic mat-
tor is necessary to these reducing
processes.

Editor The Punta Gorda Her
ald : Much has been said and
written of the Catts-Knott contro
versy for the Democratic nomina
tion for governor of Florida. The
aws of Florida provide for the
settlement of elections and for the
settlement of nominations. In
the case of elections, every one
must, of necessity abide the result.
n the settlement of nominations,
every one should, of necessity,
abide the result. Whether Catts
or Knott is the nominee,I will, not
of necessity, but gladly support
tho nominee.
It seems to me that all Demo
crats, who do not do so gladly.
must, of necesity, abide the result
by supporting the nominee. I am

Confederate Veterans' Re-Union
Tampa, Oct. 9. Tampans are
making elaborate preparations for
the entertainment of Confederate
veterans of Florida, who will hold
heir annual re-union in the citv
Octoberl7 to 19, inclusive, and a
arge attendance of veterans and
isitors generally is expected.
The railroad rate offered for the
round trip from all sections of the
state is one fare plus 25 cents,
with a liberal time limit.
This will be one of the last re
unions held by the veterans, many
of whom have grown too old to
attend, by reason of which Tampa
invites all lovers of the "old
cause" to join in paying them tri
bute. Union veterans also will
participate in the re-union, a fea-

London, Eng. On the battle-
fronts in Europe.Transylvania and
Macedonia continue for the mo
ment the centers of the greatest
interest. According to Berlin,
the Rumanians in Transylvania,
are retreating along the whole
line. The Teutonic Allies have
recaptured the town of Torezburg,
fifteen miles southeast of Kron
stadt, and within seven miles of
the Rumanian border. In the
Danube, north of- Sistova, the
Germans have occupied an island,
taking six guns and making pris

there. 1 ,
Serbians in considerable force
have crossed the Cerna River in
Serbia and captured the town of
Skochivir, southeast of Monastir,
and also have occupied positions
along the north bank of the river.
Considerable hard fighting has
again taken place in the region
west of Lutsk and farther south
in Galicia, but the results are
somewhat beclouded by reason of
the contradictory reports of the
Petrograd and Berlin war office
statements. Petrograd says the
Russians at some points in the
Volhynia succeeded in entering
Austro-German posit ions east of
Vladmir-Volynski, but Berlin re
