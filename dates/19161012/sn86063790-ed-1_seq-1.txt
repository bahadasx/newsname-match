l order that it may meet the competi,
tion of the world after the Europear
- war and cited legislation of his adt
ministration as going far in this dii
rection.
It was the president's first trip inl

J KILLS TWO; WOUNDS ONE.

Then Sends Fatal Bullet Into His
5 Own Head Near Greenwood.
Greenwood, Oct. 8.?Using three
bullets from a 32-calibre pistol, Charc
ley Luquire, a chain gang guard, last
night killed three men, including
himself, and with two shots probably
fatally wounded a fourth. This quadruple
tragedy occurred at the county
- farm about four miles east-of town.
The dead are Milton Townsend,
3 manager of the county farm and alms
house; Pomp Davis, his father-in;
law, and Charley Luquire, the guard
i who killed these two and then killed
r himself.
Tom McCombs, captain of the counr
ty gangs, and a brother to Supervisor
. J. B. McCombs, was shot twice
.. through the right lung, and though
1 still alive this evening, his condition
. is regarded as highly precarious and
his chances of recovery are very
j slight.
r Charley Luquire, the guard who
? ran amuck, came to town yesterday
to attend the circus. He was told by
McCombs be back at the farm by
5 o'clock. Luquire, it is said, began
drinking when he reached town, and
was in an ugly mood all the after1
.noon. He started a row in a pool
1 room and once or twice pulled out his
pistol and threatened to "shoot up"
_ m
somebody, it is stated. He did not
leave town until late, reaching the
farm a little after 7.
Begins Shooting.
Tom McCombs was sitting in a
1 buggy out in front of the residence
! occupied by Manager Townsend. He
1 was expecting to come into town himself,
and was waiting for Luquire
to return. He says he remarked to
Luquire that he was late and was
_ about to keep the others from going
to the night performance of the show.
Without a word in reply, but with an
[ oath, he says, Luquire pulled his pis'
tol and fired twice at McCombs, botn
shots taking effect in the right lung.
As McCombs crumpled up on the
buggy seat, old Mr. Davis, who lived
with Mr. Townsend, his son-in-law,
t and who was standing near, remarked,
involuntarily, "Why Charlie, you
have drilled Mr. Tom," and without
7 a word, Luquire fired at him, one
^ shot piercing him in the abdomen.
1 Just as Mr. Davis fell, Townsend,
3 who was eating supper, rushed out of
3 his house, and started down the front
3 path calling out to know what was
3 the matter. Luquire fired once at
* him, thirty yards away in the dusk as
r it was, and he, too, fell with a wound
3 through his body.
Ends own Existence.
Luquire then walked into the
3 house, where Mrs. Townsend and
" children were, went into the room
1 he occupied, remained about a minute
7 and walked back down the front
3 path. McCombs saw him returning
and is said to have said to him,
3 "Well, Charley, you have killed three
3 of us." Answering, it is said, that
V . . . . _ ...
A that was what he started out to do,
3 Luquire placed the pistol against his
own temple and fired, and with that
fifth bullet ended his own life.
Townsend, Davis and McCombs
were rushed to the Greenwood hospital.
Davis and ToWnsend lived only
- two hours. McCombs is still living
*
j but his chances are very slight. McCombs
is a brother of Supervisor Jim
McCombs. He has a wife and two
5 small children. Townsend leaves a
' wife and three small children. His
father-in-law, Davis, had been living
with him for the past few years. His
wife is dead. Luquire, who did the
shooting, leaves a wife and two children.
All are natives,of this county.
Luquire was reared at Callison.
Townsend and Davis were from the
Cokesbury section of the county, and
MfPnmhs has livpd near town most
of his life.
Feared Loss of Job.
It is believed that Luquire had a
grudge against McCombs, fearing
that he was about to lose his job. It
was reported that, Luquire had been
. very active in behalf of another candidate
for supervisor against McCombs'
brother, and as McCombs was
elected Luquire thought he might
1 lose his job. He was regarded as a
dangerous man when drunk, and hav,
i ing become crazed with whiskey yesterday
it seems he simply went wild
and in the last hours of the day
L
placed on the county the greatest
tragedy in its history for which one
man can be held accountable.

A submarine held up the Ameri- a]

The hostile submarine is believed r<
to be the U-53, which paid a call to

when the U-53 quietly slipped into a

irough which' the stranger had

To Mail Letter, Says Captain.
Lieut. Capt. Hans Rose, who hung
p a new world's record in bringing
a armed submarine in battle array
dross the Atlantic, said he had calli
at Newport simply to mail a letter
> Count Bernstorff. He requested
either provisions nor fuel and would

scpiration of the twenty-four hours
uring which a belligerent ship may
jmain within a neutral harbor.
The submarine was in American
mters a little more than three hours,
ssuming that she continued to sea
fter submerging. Within that time
le German commander paid official
isits \o Rear Admiral Austin * M.
might, commandant of the second
istrict, and Rear Admiral Gleaves, ' * .
jmmander of the destroyer force of
le Atlantic fleet, who was on board
le flagship, the scout cruiser BirLingham.
Both American officers
^turned the brief call promptly.
Allied Vessels Warned.
While these formalities were being

arning that a hostile submarine had

There were rumors, without appar- .
at basis, that the German merchant

the opinion that the fighter ^

marching for the merchant ship.
