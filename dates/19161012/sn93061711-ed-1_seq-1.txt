ROUND-UP PROGRAN
FINISHED FRIDAY
FINAL RESULTS
Thu Cowboys' General Roundup in
Tucumcari, last week was pronounced
ly almost everybody iih n grand suc
cess. Of course some of tho more
modest thought it was n little wild.
Imt as far iih the cowboys part of the
program was concerned, it wax noth
ing out of thu way. The hoys tool; a
few days off and these who remained
Holier took down the prize money. It
was a noticahlo fact that the cowboy
of today is jut as good as the cowboy
of yesterday, anil Home of them were
total abstainer from strong drink.
This was commendalile. Contests and
athletics of all kinds today call for
young men with clean habits and this
was proven in the roundup here.
The city was practically thrown wide
open and it was expected that the
roundup would end in a free for all.
The cowboys rode their horse. into
some of tho saloons and put on spec
tacular exhibitions for the moving
picture man. Many daring feats wore
performed and in order to secure a
wild-west picture different from any
thing yet thrown upon the screen il
seemed that some of the large crowd
would be crippled, but not so. After
the movie man had finished it was
mote calm and the would-be touch
was the only "drunk" to he seen. There
wcru plenty of those who took advan
tage of the opportunity. The carnival
company had a fuw attractions thai
were worthy of patronage, but the 111
show was a disgrace. It might have
boon better to have staged that show
over across the track in the "red light'
district.
There were two moving piclirv
shows in operation and they were of
the URual high merit. The hoxin-c ex
hibition by Livingston and I.ubb win
worth the money. They are both good
clean men, what I.ubb lnek in suico
he makes up in being able to covi r up
at the right moment and wi.-rv his
opponent as well as punish him se
verely Livingston is a credit to the
boxing profession and believes in giv
ing his audience its money's worth.
The restaurants and eating houses
were ti;uo to their promise and well
provided for their guests t the reg
ular prices charged month in and
month out. The wagon yards were
forced to charge for bed which neces
sarily was a little above the usual, but
at that, the charges were reasonable
considering thu responsibility attached
to caring for bo many teams and rigs
which also called for extra help.
The jitney service to tho grounds
seemed a little bit high but those who
cared to save that twenty-live cent
piece could do so. Some of the boys
had so much bad luck with punctured
tires and other diflkultios that their
net earning was not nearly so much
as they had figured.
The mistakes of the first roundup
will be remembered and remedied next
year. The roundup drew a much larg
er crowd and was far moro successful
financially or otherwise than wuh ex
pected by those who really had faith
in it and spent their time and money
furthering every phase on the enter
tainment program.
Next year the grand stand will bo
extended and bleachers built out both
ways. This will give every person
a chance to sec thu performers and
therefore get their money's worth. As
il was last week the grand stand was
not near largo enough and was jam
med each day.
Slim Allen, Hugger Red and Prairie
Lilly Allen were here, coming nearly
directly from New York where they
won hundreds of dollars in the big
million dollar stampede They are ex
perts in their line, but were up against
bard competition. Texas Jack, li. Gil
lespie, Tom Kckard, Fred Atkinson,
Allen Brassfiold, Itiul Clayton, and Hud
Hill in thu more daring events; Kill
Davis, Kh Gholson, Royal Lackey, Wy
att Nations, Rufo Culhcrtson, Saiulv
Fluitt, (ienc Gnllcgos, F. Taggart, Mill
Humes, .1. Hryant and many others of
this section, carried away many hon
ors in roping, riding etc.

The roundup ended with the wild
mule race. Four started in this race
but none of them completed tho half
mile circuit. One of the mules jumped
the fence and came up town. Thu rid
er coaxed and plead with him but ho
could not get tho mule further than
the corral. The other mules visited
diirereiit sections of the city and Mr.
Hagley finally convinced tho riders
that it was be.- to call the game on
account of darkness, and split thu mon
ey lour ways. All the riders agreed
and the 1st Annual Cowboys Roundup
ended with a satisfied bunch of boost-
rs for next year's roundup.
The donations by the murchants,
cattlemen, and other progressive cit
izens, together with the entrance fees
for contestants amounted to more than
$.",(1011. The gate receipts wore more
than $2,000. This guarantees tho pay
ment in full of all the cash premiums
and all other indebtedness incurred by
the Roundup committees. The boxing
exhibition was the only losing event
handled by the Roundup Association.
Messrs. Hagley, Hoyer, Dovor, Street,
and others who so faithfully assisted,
deserve great credit for their untir
ing efforts to make the first roundup
a grand success.
The contestants were . atislled and
the large crowds which attended each
lay were loud in their prai?e and wore
well entertained up to.n ly tho nice
music of the Amarillc band, the jitne
dnnco, moving picture shows, etc Tu
cumcari proved herself equal to thu
occasion and while some mistakes were
made, she will bid for a bigger and
butler show next year, and prepare to
take care of the crowds in better shape
a- well is hang up larger purses.

DWELLING HOUSES
IN DEMAND-A FEW
ARE BEING ERECTED
Tucumcari needs moro residences of
modern build. There are several cit
izens iguring on building homo.- and
omu have already let contracts for
.' a me.
Dr. Catterson has purchased lots
from A. H. Simpson, and excavation
bus already commenced. This resi
lience will contain about seven rooms
and be modern throughout, and will
make t valuable addition to tho nice
residences already located on First
street.
Kugene Jacobs' now home is being
pushed as rapidly as possible and this
will add another modern homo to Tu
cumcari's Second street. It will bo
constructed of wood and pebblo-dashod
and will be strong as well as beautiful
in appearance.
Freeman Allen has just completed
remodeling his adobe residence, 10
cently purchased from Mr. Cobb. He
had a front room added and other
changes made, making it modern and
convenient.
Judge Cutlip is having a house re
modeled and will have it made modern
throughout, thus providing another
rood "for rent" house.
W. .1. Kiten has purchased lots in
(lie south part of town and proposed
t.i erect a large two-story modern
home thereon. It will contain about
uvehe rooms and will cost in the

been drawn but as yet Mr. Kitzen is
i bttle undecided what he want.-.
This building fever is catching and
it- one epidemic the health officers
do not care to stop. The more tho
'lieriier. If some man would build
wenty-live new houses with bath and
-it her modern conveniences, they would
: 1 1 1 be taken before completed. There
are families living in other towns that
' desirous of coming here if a suit
ible place can be found. Some small
house.- are occupied by as many as
four families. Tucumcari needs a few
more houses at once.

of a revival meeting now in progress
at the First Haptist church in Tucum
cari. Pastor A. L. Maddox is doing
the preaching in an acceptable manner
on such vital themes as "Sin," "Satan"
"Hades" and "Hell." His preaching
is characteristic of the preaching of
Moody, Whitfield and Spurgeon on
doctrinal themes. Up to Wednesday
night there had been six conversions,
most of whom were grown people, and
six additions to the church. Mrs. Mc
GrilT of Albuquerque joined the forces
Tuesday night to lead tho choir and to
bring the gospel message in solos.
Mrs. McGriff adds much to tho forces,
and every lover of sweet vocal solos
will find in some respects an incom
parable message in song.
The meeting continues throughout
next week at 10:00 o'clock each morn
ing and 7:.'I0 nt night.
People from the town or country
are welcomed.
MISS HAGLEY DIES FROM
SEPTIC POISONING
The 12-year-old daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. A. II. Hagley. died in this city
Saturday after an illnes- of only a
few days duration.
It is understood that site was suf
fering from tonsilitis which suddenly
took hold something on the order of
the disease which ended Charles Kohn
so suddenly a few months ago. of sep
tic poisoning.
Miss Hagley was a strong young
girl and had been enjoying the round
up together with the other young peo
ple and attended the dance at night.
It is thought that she became over
exerted as she enjjoyed dancing.
Mrs. Hagley and her daughter had
made many warm friends during their
short stay in Tucumcari. where Mr.
Hagley was engaged as arena director
for the Roundup contests, and tho re
port of the sudden death of Miss Bag-
ley came as a severe shock to every
one.
The body was prepared for burial
and shipped to Tulia Texas where in
terment was made. 1 ho many friends
here join the News in extending sym
pathy to the broken-hearted parents.

TOWNDRQW MURDER
CASE ON TRIAL - TWO
OTHERS TO COME UP
District court is grinding along alow
ly on account of the murder uaiu.
The Towndrow cao is up for houring
and a special venire of petit jurors
was necessary. The lawyers from both
sides are caieful in the selection of
this jury. Some of the strongest le
gal talent 'in the west is hero to ap
pear on one side or the other. Mr.
Towndrow is charged with having kill
ed his wife with a stove poKer. Lit
tle is known of the case as it in from
Colfax and was brought hore on n
change of venue.
The Anderson murder cany, in whish
R. L. Anderson is charged with hav
ing killed his brother-in-law a few
weeks ago. by shooting him in tho
back of the head while ho slent. An
derson confessed to the killing and
was put in jail without being allowed
bail It is understood he afterward
denied any knowledge whatever and
this case will be commenced us soon
as the Towndrow case is finished. It
is set for next Monday, hut there is
little liklihood of it being brought to
trial on that day.
Immediately following that wise is
another murder trial, that of Paul
Huebler, who is charged with tho mur
der of .loir Woodnrd, former deputy
sheriff of Logan. The killing took
place on the Woodnrd farm whore
both men were stnying as friends,
and Huebler claims he shot Woodard
in self-defense. It is understood thnt
Huebler will also make a plea of un
written law. There aru numerous
witnesses for both sides und this cane
will perhaps he the most interonting
of anything on tho docket, owing to
the nature and circumstances.
In the case of Sands-Dorsey vs. tho
City of Tucumcari the jury decided in
favor of tho drug company and as
sessed the damages at something over
SHOO together with costs of suit. This
suit was caused by the water breaking
under the sidewalk from the street
and damaging a large amount of sta
tionery, drugs, etc., which were leapt
in the basement under the store.
