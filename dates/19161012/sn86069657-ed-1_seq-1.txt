Hauling Freight.
it is an every day occurrence
that wagon loads of goods and
other freight goes from the de
oot here to the oil fields. Dress
od lumber is another very nn
portaut article that goes front
here. The field may be know
as the "Irvine field" but Olay
City figures quite prominently in
its behalf. All we need is
year 'round passable road np
Hardwick's creek so freight and
passengers can get from hero
there and the business will come
this way. The Times believes
that if we had a road from here
to the oil fields such as can be
traveled every day in the year
one-half the business now going
to Irvine on account.of the oi
developments about the Cottage
and Old Furnace, would come to
Clay Oity.
