iSTMASTER JACKSON
"ACTS ACCORDINGLY
JNDER date of March 27, 1916,
rtmaster W. R. Jackson, President
the Mexico Intelligencer Company,
ei a letter which we have on file,
Jressod to Shirley Thompson, man
ijr of the Orpheum Theatre, Mexico,
larding an advertising proposition,
follows:
f; " I have always been a good
griend toward your interests,
Save used you in every proper
way; but if you have no appreci
ation for these many favors
done you, I want to know it that
I may act accordingly. I would
be glad to hear from you in the
matter." .
On October "8t WIG, the Intelli
sncer contained the following edi
rinl: WORK FOR THE D. A. R's.
"While the Daughters of the Amer-
an Revolution are investigating the
picturea shown at the Orpheum Thea
tre here from a moral standpoint, it
might be well for them to extend the
scope of their investigation to include
the physical safety of the Orpheum's
matrons.
"From time to time the Intelligencer
1 as heard complaints of the construc
ion of the building with reference to
.re hazard. Two red lights, marked
exit" near the stage, really mark
flights of steps. In case of an
'arm, imagine a panic - stricken au
clambering up these steps,
hich do not lead out of doors, but
the stage. The real exits are
.., at. the back of the stage.
;"This newspaper knows nothing of
,e character ot tne pictures snown
-iseently beyond the fact a local con
emporary says editorially they are
lie best to be obtained, while certain
"nembers of the D. A. H. Punce
aictures that have been exhibited to
be unfit. The Intelligencer does not
set itself up as a censor of public
morals, but we may suggest with per
fect propriety tnai me pnysicui ua
zard should be investigated."
In addition to a column of inter
views regarding the Orpheum Theatre
the Postmaster's Daily Intelligencer
Jof October 9th, contains the following
1 .ini.i.
"The intent of the publicity given to
il,o Ornheum's firo hazard, in so far
. iJie Intollieenccr is concerned, is in
the interest or public saicty. ine
Daughters of the American kcvoiu
tion and the Women's Federation of
vinv mi have protested against me
moral tone of the pictures in perfect
sincerity anil with no desire to perse
cute. We are assured by women, in
whose judgment we have utmost con
fidence, pictures hnva been shown at
the Orpheum that were unfit for
women and children. We will grant
tot it probably is difficult in this day
obtain popular pictures entirely
moid of the objectionable Buggcstive
, awil to let mis maucr renv wim wo
wiien'a organizations, believing they
n capable of determining what
should be shown and what should not
be exhibited. In so far as the phy
sical safety of the theatre is concern
Hi, the proper authorities should in

Great Benefit to Citizens.
In spite of the seeming magnitude

Traffic Over Chicago & Alton Held

Tuesday Morning.
Monday evening the "Plug," other
wise known as No. 37, which is due
into Mexico from the east at 8:15 in
the evening, was derailed at the west
switch at Booth. The plug is due at
Booth at seven o'clock. None of the
train crew or passengers were in
jured. A defective switch frog is
thought to have been the cause of the
derailmnt. !
The derailment occurred just as the
train entered the switch at Booth.
John E. Fish, Division Freight and
Passenger Agent of the Chicago &
Alton, was on the train at the time,
and says it must have been caused by
a defect in the frog at the switch.
The tender left the track first and the
entire train was derailed, but none of
the coaches or the engine turned over.
Mr. Fish stated, that the only thing,
in his opinion, which prevented the
cars from turning over was that the
couplings held and each car served to
hold the others up.
All west bound trains over the
Chicago & Alton Monday night were
detoured by way of Hannibal to Mo
berly. No west bound trains passed
through Mexico Monday night on
Chicago & Alton, but the track was
cleared and traffic over it resumed
Tuesday.

FIRE TUESDAY NIGHT
Tuesday niiht about 9:30 o'clock fire
was discovered in the barn at the home
of High Piper, on South Western av
enue. An alarm was turned in, but,
although the fire department made a
record run, the fore was so well under
way when they reached the scene
that the barn and most of its con
tents were destroyed.
A buggy and two sets of harness in
the barn were destroyed. The loft
was filled with hay, which caused the
fire to spread rapidly and a small
stack of hay and millet near the barn
was also destroyed.
Mr. Piper had insurance of $400 on
the barn, but the loss is estimated at
almost $1,000.
The cause of the fire is not known.
Albert Harrison, from Audrain coun
ty, one of the season's heaviest contri
butors to the St. Louis trade from that
section of Missouri which produces
so many of the fat cattle disposed of
here, scored his fourth top of the sea
son here today, when a drove of year
ling steers of his own handling brought
the day's highest price paid for that
class of stock. He is one of the top
notch feeders coming this way and
deals exclusively at this point, buy
ing his feeders here and later turning
them out as finished product and
at prices too, which leave little doubt
as to his thorough acquaintance with
all the fine points of the industry. His
price was $10.40 per cwt. paid for 23
head of 880-pounders.
This drove is the last of five loads,
which Mr. Harrison bought on this
market at $8.25 per cwt. last fall. His
previous marketings brought him
$10.25 on two loads and $10.35 on two
others. On a fifth, which he had here
last week he secured $10.40 per cwt.
The excellent manner in which he
conducts his operations coupled with
the class of stock he turns out and his
ability to strike the market always at
the right time is truly commendable.
He uses a ration of corn, hay and lin
seed oil meal. Live Stock Reporter.

LIKES OUR HIGHWAY
W. A. Lippman, writing of motor
tours in Saturday's St. Louis Times,
and in speaking of touring Missouri,
says:
"I would be untrue to the spirit
in which this has been written if
I failed to comment on the differ
ent work that has been done along
the National Old Trail or Boone's
Lick road, between High Hill and
St. Charies. For that matter,
much praise is due the commis
sioners who have so well improved
the Mexico section to High Hill
where the national road is taken
up. "
"As related elsewhere, this Me
ico turn - out is worth taking
when going west and until
the Minneola Hills are im
proved, no one, except in fairest
of fair weather, should attempt
the southern route."
