CORKING HOfi SALE
•Manchester Bret. Slid 66 Head far
^$3465, aa Average off $52.50.
^^Two Broaght $200 Each.
^Manchester Bros., the well known
breeders of Poland China hogs, had
-a corking good sale last Thursday
when they sold 83 head. The entire
offering of 66 head of catalogued
.stuff was snapped up in short order,
:Mjp and still there were buyers who want
ed some of their stock and 17 head
of young pigs which they had not
prepared for sale were put up and
sold at fancy prices. For the 66 head
4T$ catalogued the total amounted to
*VP 13465, an average of $52.50, which
iif is a high average considering that
many of them were young hogs. The
tops of the sale were the herd boar
Jumbo Boy, bought by J. G. William
Jick, of Oxford Junction, Iowa, at
$200, and the sow Manchester Maid,
&V" for which E. Cook, a well known
j»j $200, and E. Massey, of Woodland
"tiff' *C township, paid $195 for the sow Miss
Long Wonder. Buyers who had at
3 tended all the big hog sales in south
«rn Iowa and northern Missouri this
fall, said that Manchester Bros, had
the best of ail the sales they had
attended. They had a splendid line
A
J! of animals and were well pleased
with the prices realized. There was
& very large crowd in attendance,
and we are mighty glad that so many
of these good hogs were purchased
by Decatur county breeders. They
will add materially to the breeding
of Decatur county liogs, and will sure
make money for their owners.

Book Agents Worked School
Teachers.
breeder of Pattonsburg, Mo., paid Kansas City, worked a graft on sev- which there were 22 entries. The
eral Decatur county school teachers judges were Dr.
the past week, as a result of which
they were arrested Friday evening,
but made their escape Monday morn
ing. Upon coming to Leon the fel
lows visited the county superintend
ent's office and secured a list of
teachers, making inquiries as to
which were new teachers. They then
visited about forty of these teachers,
and informed them that the set of
books which they were selling were
ordered placed in their school by the
county superintendent, in order to
make their school accredited. In
some instances when the teacher re
fused to order them without an order
from the director they went away for
a short time and came back telling
the teacher the director had ordered
the books bought. Then they woyld
take the order and the teacher's
note for $24.76, in payment. Friday
evening the matter was brought to
the attention of the county attorney's
office, and the men were arrested at
their hotel by deputy sheriff Bob
Craig, an information being filed
against them before Justice Wood
mansee, and they plead not guilty.
They did not want to go to jail, while
waiting for a member of the Kansas
City firm to come to their-relief, so
they were placed in the custody of
mal-shal Marion Osborn, and he
guarded them Saturday and Sunday,
but they managed to put him off his
guard, and while he had gone home
for a few minutes early Monday
morning, they quietly werit to the
dejot and bought tickets for Albany,
Mo. Sheriff Lorey wired to Albany
and Kansas City, but- they evidently
made their getaway, and.-have,not
since been heard of. The fellows1
were pretty smooth grafters for they,
did not try to work any of the ex
perienced teachers, confining their
operations to teachers who had just
commenced teaching, and about for
ty of them signed the notes for the
books, and the agents secured about
$
1,0 00 worth of. notes.
A Great Religious Movement.
All of the churches of Leon are
uniting in a simultaneous campaign
for the salvation of souls. These
meetings will begin on next Monday
night with each pastor in his respec
itive church. The closing service will
jbe Nov. 13, which will be a union
service. The place where it is to be
[held, to be announced later. A word
to all church people, who may be in
terested in other things: It is not our
I purpose to fight lodges or clubs, for
we believe in them, our only thought
lis to help you along this particular
line, to be of larger service. So we
will ask people directly interested in
this work to lay asfde for these meet
ings as much as possible for one
'month. After we have put forth'a
strenuous revival effort then we may
turn our attention in part to social
and fraternal things. Don't forget!
Everybody goes to church next Mon
day night. There will be meetings
on the street, also prayer meetings
in the homes.
Will Spend $100,000 Improving De
catur County Farms.
S. C.- Bradford, who has invested
very heavily in Decatur county farm
lands the past year, expects to spend
$100,000 in the next year in improv
ing these farms if he can secure
men to do the work on them. The

fences, and he has nineteen
miles of hedge to pull. He is also
tiling wherever tiling can be used to
advantage, for he believes that tiling
will pay big returns. He has a large
amount of Decatur county farm land,
and he ic not going to have any of
the land wasted, but will make it all
productive. He is setting an example
which others can follow with profit.
Pat Griffin Will Locate in Leon.
We told you several weeks ago
that fat Griffin, of Creston, had a
hankering to get back to good old
Decatur county, and sure enough he
is coming. Mr. Griffin last week
bought the old Warner homestead
and acreage property on north
Church street ^and will erect a com
modious new residence on the prop
erty next spring. We .are mighty
glad to see the Griffin family become
residents of Leon. They havevmany
friends here who will welcome them
as residents of Leon. Mr. Griffin
moved to Creston from Grand River
last spring, after being a resident of
that town, for more than twenty-five
years.. _r,

Very Important.
Indeed are our eyes, so delicate in
their structure and so indispensible,
yet entirely automatic in their action.
Long strain of the eyes especially
of children, results in an unnatural
condition of the eyes. The trial cases
do not always reveal the nature of
the defect. In recent years other
methods of determining these defects
have been discovered and whep used
in connection with the trial case in
sure the best possible results. But
ler, the jeweler and optometrist, has
his fitting room fully equipped with
the most up-to-date of these instru
ments, and uses them in every case
that he examines.

GIVE US MORE LIGHT.
feme Figures in Regard to Street
Lighting Service in Leon.
We stated last week that an order
had been made for the street lights
to burn until 1 o'clock at night in
stead of being turned off at midnight,
but the council rescinded the order
on Thursday. They seem to think
that they must economize on street
{ighting so as not to overrun their
contract with the electric light com
pany.
When the new franchise was
granted to the Leon Electric Co., last
spring it provided that all the street
lights including any which may here
after be installed were to be burned
on 2,000 hours per annum under the
direction of the city council. The
franchise also provides that in case
ss than 1,800 hours of streets light-
4.
in the seven months, an average of
only 103 hours per month. That
would leave 1,279 hours to be burn
ed in the next five months to use up
the 2,000 hours per month. We can
not see how" they are going to use
it, for according to the Philadelphia
schedule providing for all night ser
vice, and running as high as 13 hours
and 20 minutes per day during the
short days of December, it only re
quires a total of 1035 hours, allow
ing for 200.4 hours in October, 216.2
in, November, 229.4 in December,
2-10.1 in January and 179.1 in Feb
ruary, leaving a balance of 352 hours
to be burned on exceptionally dark
uays, or else the lights will have to
be burned in broad day light.
We fail to see how they are going
tp use up the number of hours which
the franchise calls for, and which the
council has no authority to change.
As long as the city has to pay for the
lights wby not turn them on, and
give the people what they are prying
for?
Will You See the Balloons Sunday?
Many people in Decatur county
saw three big balloons which pass
ed Leon about 8 o'clock Sunday morn
ing. They started from,, Muskogee,
Oklahoma, Saturday evening at 5
o'clock in the national endurance
race, there being six starters. One
balloon came down near Muskogee
that evening, St. Louis No. 1 landed
near Macon, Mo., the "White" landed
near Sheldon, lotfa, Sunday fore
noon, the "Uncle Sam" landed at
Cascade, Iowa, near Dubuque Sun
day afternoon at 1:30, having travel
ed 510 miles as the crow flies, when
their gas gave out. One balloon, the
"St. Louis," has never been sighted
since it left Muskogee, and fears are
entertained for Capt. John Henry, of
St. Louis.
The three balloons were not very
high up when they passed over Leon,
and the occupants tried to talk to
various parties but they could not
be understood. A few years ago two
balloons which started from Kansas
City passed over this county, and
there must be some attraction for
them up this way.
Sold a Farm With $9,000 Profit.
S. C. Bradford, the Des Moines
man who has bought a number of
Decatur county farms in the past
year, on Monday sold one of them,
the 400 acre farm near Garden Grove
which he bought of Thomas and
Bert Teale, about four months ago,
to Clarence Hedges, of Anita,
Towa,
who owned a large farm adjoining
it, at a profit of $9,000 over what
he paid for it. He bought this farm
at $82.50 per* acre, and sold it for
$10o.00 an acre. The deal was ne
gotiated by A. M. Pryor''of Leon, and
Will Barbour, of Garden Grove.
W. H, Snyder to Retire from

Kensett Won Prize for Most Autos in

Kensett, a little town of 300. in
habitants in Worth county, Iowa, has
been declared to be the winner of
first choice of the prizes offered for
the town having the largest number

In the title role of "The Pretty Sis
ter of Jose," Frances Hodgson Bur
nett's charmfng romance of old Spain
and Maud Adams' former starring ve-»
hide, the dainty star, Marguerite^.
Clark, attains one of her greatest'.
serene triumphs. The role is one in»
which every resource and power of
the magnetic little star is brought
into effective play, and she takes the
fullest advantage of her many emo-."
tional opportunities. As the tiny, ex
quisite Spanish girl of a thousand
moods and whims, who has vowed
never to lose her heart, but who,!
when finally conquered by the hand
some Sebastiano, loves truly and de-^

parable, and denotes exceedingly well
the struggle in the girl's heart 'to
maintain a haughty demeanor toward
the man she has learned to adore,
while longing to yield to the impulses
of her love. With her fascinating^,
dark beauty and charming grace of^g
form and motion, Miss Clark is excep
tionally adapted to the role of the 7
dainty little dark eyed belle of Ma
drid: The scenic environment of
California, where the subject was
produced, lends itself faithfully to
the atmosphere of the story, and its
rapidly changing development, with'
its wealth of color and romance, has
resulted in a thoroughly unusual and
picturesque photo play.

Don't Violate the Postal Laws.
It has come to my notice and to
other postmasters that the people^
who are going to have a sale are
themselves and having other people .:
distribute the sale bills over the«
*c,ountry tnese parts upon coming
a mail box will deposit a sale
the box for the party who owns
a it a
postage. This is probaby done
tentionally but does not excuse the
party from a heavy fine, not over*.,
$500. I do not wish to cause anyone"^
trouble, but a strict watch is beingL^
kept ana some one may be called^
upon to contribute to Uncle Sam.
The county paper is the best placed
to advise the people as to such mat-^43
ters and I would appreciate it if you^.^r
would call their attention to this mat-« 1^,
ter through your columns this week.-
