A PASSDKER
LIST Of 250
Will Call at Halifax
5,000 Canadians For
the Army.
New Tork, Oct. 12.—After being
held in port for four days in fear that
the German submarine U-53, and pos
sibly others of the undersea raiders
were lying in wait for her as a rich
prize, the White Star liner Adriatic
Is to sail today with about 250 pas
sengers and nearly 18,000 tons of
cargo, mostly war munitions. It is
expected she will stop at Halifax to
take aboard some 6,000 Canadian
troops.
A dozen British ships, including the
Adriatic grot their clearance papers
yesterday but It was said that with
the exception of the Adriatic the dates
of their departure would depend upon
the developments in the efforts which,
it is taken for granted, the British
admiralty Is making to rid American
waters of the submarine danger. The
White Star officials said the Adriatic
would sail today and prospective pas
sengers had been so notified..
The continued advices of additional
submarine activities along the Atlan
tic lanes resulted today in a reduction
in marine insurance rates from the
high mark struck Monday. Rates
were quoted at 2 1-2 per cent, a drop
of 50 per cent from the general quota
tions earlier in the week-
Raider May Need Supplies.
There was a strong tendency in
naval circles today to believe that the
U-63, unless that craft has received
fresh fuel supplies on this side of the
Atlantic, has hauled off shore and is
headed for her base at Helgoland.
The belief Is founded on the knowl
edge. that. the cruising "radius- of- t)ie
U-5& class boats does not exceed 7,000
miles or just sufficient to permit mak
ng a voyage "out from" Helgoland via'
the north of Scotland to Newport and
return.' It is considered possible, how-,
eve*, that sufficient extra fuel Tfrais
parried to permit of a couple of days'
stay on the operating ground.
By every precedent in commerce
destroying work, experts said, the
rr-53 might be expected to abandon
'he Nantucket shoals locality after
Sunday. Merchant ships. It was point
°d out, would give the Nantucket
lisrbtshlp a wide berth as soon as ap
praised of the presence of a sub
marine.
On the Way to the "Comer,"
One report which has not been veri
fied. which was to the effect that the
U-53 took on board crude oil from
the Christian Kudsen before sinking
'hat craft. In the event that the
!J-53 has not been able to replenish
her fuel tanks, the view was ex
pressed that the logical course for her
to take would be to follow the line of
the gulf stream to the "Corner," as
It Is known to navigators. The "Cor
ner" is the turning point in the North
Atlantic where traffic between the
United Kingdom and the United States
either heads up for the English chan
nel or shapes away for various ports
on the American seaboard.
From New York to the "Corner" 's
a distance of about 1,060 miles and
from the "Corner" to Helgoland via
the north coast of Scotland Is a dis
tance of about 2,400 miles.
In heading for the "Corner" the
U-53 would be reaching: along to
wards her base, and would be In a
oosltion even more advantageous
than off Nantucket to strike a blow
at munitions ships, It was pointed out.

Washington, Oct. 12.—While no im
mediate steps are in contemplation
for the actual establishment of a
naval neutrality patrol along the At
lantic coast as a result of the German
submarine raid, the n'avy department
completed a definite plan to be put in
to operation if the campaign con

The entire destroyer force, active
and reserve, assisted by light cruisers,
navy tugs, and other auxiliary craft
will be employed to protect American
territorial waters, and also to prevent
the establishment of any secret bases
ashort or communication between
shore radio stations and belligerent
craft.
The whole submarine situation,
both as to the recent raid on the New
England coast, and the broader ques
tion of agitation in Germany for ruth
less resumption of the warfare, shows
signs in official quarters of having
practically cleared up.
Also, Rear Admiral Gleaves, com

or Kingstonian was sunk by the Ger
man submarine. After a long search,
the destroyer force found no trace of

London, Oct. 12.—Vice Admiral
Dartige Uu Fournet, commander of

to Greece, demanding that Greece
hand over the entire Greek fleet, ex
cept the armored cruiser Averoff and
the battleships Lemnos and Kilkis, to
the entente allies, according to Reu
ter's Athens correspondent. Demand
is also made for the control of the
Piraeus-Larlssa railway.
The minister of marine, the corre
spondent continues, says Vice Admiral
Fournet's demands were complied
with and that the fleet was handed
over before the prescribed time.
The demands were made as a pre
cautionary measure to insure the
safety of the allies' fleet.
The Greek authorities yielded to the
entente demands for turning over
virtually the entire Greek navy and
dismantling or surrender of forts on
the seacoast.
The control by entente of all mate

order to render impossible their use
to the detriment of the entente force,
is reported included in the demands.
