DEMOCRATIC SPEAKING.
Hon. C. II. Drough, Democratic
nominee for Governor of Arkansas, will
speak in the Court House here next
Monday evening, beginning promptly
at 7:30 o'clock. Mr. Urough is one of
the finest campaigners on the stump
this year, the National Committee
having assigned him to make thirty
speeches in the state of Maine during
the recent campaign. We are indeed
fortunate in securing this highly edu
cated orator for Lancaster. Every
voter in the county should come out
and give him a hearty welcome. Ladies
especially invited.
"DAKOTA JACK" HERE.
Friends of Dr. J. J. Pursley and wife
were glad to welcome them at their old
home last week, where they have been
making some sale contracts with the
different drug stores throughout the
blue grass. Dr. I'ursley is a firm be
liever in advertising and he tells of
some wonderful results that a few in
ches of advertising have recently
brought him through the medium of the
press. He has contracted with Stormes
Drug Store to handle his goods in this
territory and his advertisement will
appear in every issue of the Record for
several months. Read them.
"BILLY" IS ALRIGHT.
That "Hilly" Swope, a former Lan
caster boy, but now located at Lex

lose his vote at the coming November
election, the I-exington Herald has the
following to tuy;
"J. W. Swope, of the Fayette Cigar
Company, went to Lancaster yesterday
to register so he could cast his first
vote at the November election for
Woodrnw Wilson. He had changed
precincts here September 12 and could
not vote in Lexington, tho sixty-day
precinct regulation preventing. He
made the seventy. five mile trip
only to find after his arrival there that
regUtration was not required in Lan
caster, the town being ef the fifth class.
Swope is one of the few persons of
the Swope name in this section who is
a full-fledged democrat."
FISHING PARTY RETURNS.
After a week's angling on the waters
of Rockcastle river and full to over
flowing with experiences of recent
catches, squirrel pies, fried chicken, a
la Charity, and Poplar Root sweet
potatoes, the fishermen reported In our
last week's issue, drove into Lancaster
Tuesday night and have been enter
taining their left-over friends with
their many catches and happy hours
spent at the home of Mrs. Charity
Poynter, near the brinks of the famous
Rockcastle. Sad to relate however,
they found the Cumberland river mud
dy and their entire time was spent on
the Rockcastle. They all admit "we
had fairly good luck" and give Judge
Fred Friable credit for landing the
largest catch, which was a seven pound
salmon and measured twenty-nine in
ches. They report a total of about 76
fish (not pounds) caught during the
weak.
96 ADDITIONS

conduct a two weeks meeting.
COBURN'S MINSTRELS
At Opera House Saturday Night.
The mere mention of the name
"Cohurn" send thrill of joy through
ones body, and the fact that he is to
bring his greater minstrel to the Lan
caster Opera House next Saturday
night, is indeed a joy that knows no
bounds. Thoye who have seen this
wonderful minstrel could not conceive
that it could be improved upon, but we
are assured that this years shows have
reached the height of minstreldom.
The ensemble opening is a departure
from oldtimo stereotype groupings and
ideas, introducing the entire company
in Charlie Gano's latest minstrel con
ception "Ameiica's Millionaire Hunt
Cluti" that has been royally received
before Kings and Queens of many
countries,

GOOD DEMAND
For Kentucky Red Berkshire.
The demand that has been created
for the Kentucky Red Uerkshires in
the past few weeks has surpassed all
records and the breeders of this class
are making daily shipments to various
tates to fill their increased oiders. W.
O. Walker, of Stanford sold two boar
pigs to James Sharpe of Georgia, for
which he received fiO and a pair to R.
H. Sharp, of Texas, for $20. Robert
T. Hruce sold a number to Woodford
county people ot fancy prices, they go
ing to a territory where the Duroc has
had full sway for a number of years.
James Iiurnside of this county sold five
nice shoats to Ernest Hoover, of Jes
samine, for which he received $100.
All breeders of this class report unpre
cedented sales and think the reputation
that this breed has already established
will make them the coming hog in the
state.

after round of applause, when telling
points were made in favor of the re
election of President Wilson. Dem
ocrats are becoming aroused and will
get out a full vote on November 7th.
Many request were made that Chair
man Elkin bring his team of speaker
to the various school houses in the
county before election day, which he
has agreed to do.

RAISE ADVERTISING RATES
TO MEET COST OF PAPER
Paducah.Ky., Oct, llth -Uniform
rates for advertising and job work
were adopted at the meeting of the
First District Press Association in Pa
ducah, and the high cost of print paper
was discussed, but no remedy was with
in the power of the newspaper owner.
However, they agreed that expenses to
meet the embarrassing condition could
be reduced and higher rates on ad
vertising, job work and subscriptions
were suggested as the only alternative.
A minimum rate of ten cents an inch
for foreign advertising in plate was
fixed, with five cenU an inch additional
if the type had to be set. A rate of
not less than $2.60 for cards, legal ad
vertising and stray notices was agreed
upon, as was a schedule of price for
job work. The next meeting will be
held the last Friday In December.
