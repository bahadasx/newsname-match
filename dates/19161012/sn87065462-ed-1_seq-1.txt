"equipment" being defined by
the Federal Land Board.
c. To provide buildings and

lands; the term "improvements"
to be defined by the Federal
Land Board.
d. To liquidate .an indebted
ness already on the land or an
indebtedness subsequently incur
red for one of the purposes men
tioned above.
All loans are to be limited to
fifty percent of the appraised
value of the land.
Each borrower is to take stock
in the farm bank to five percent
of the amount of his loan. This
gradually elimates the govern
ment as a stockholder.
The shares in both loan asso
ciations and the land . banks are
five dollars each. When ap
plication for loans are made by
a loan association for its mem
bers it must be accompanied by
the statement that the applicants
are owners or about to be the
owners of land; that the loan
desired by each person is not
more than $10,000 nor less than
$100, and that the aggregate
sum desired on mortgage loans
is not less than $20,000. A
subscription to stock in the
Federal land bank equal to five
percent of the aggregate, sum
desired on mortgage loans is re
quired. The shareholders of the ' asso-
racaoiy, out not one Tor another,

tion to the extent of the amount
of the stock owned by each at

paid in and represented by the
shares.
Ihe association may retain

to exceed one eighth of one per
cent, to be deducted from divi
dends payable to farm loan
associations by the land bank.
The land bank is t) charge one
percent above the rate it pays on
bonds, which must cover admin
istration expenses and profits
The expenses incurred by. the
owner of the land to get the
title established to the satisfac
tion of the land bank come3 as
extra cost to the borrower.
Loans Through Agents
When a locality does not form
a loan association provision is
made for the Federal Farm Loan
Board to appoint as agent a
bank, trust company, mortgage
company or savings institution.
This agent acts in the stead of
the loan association and the
same regulations hold good as in
the case of the loan being ne
gotiated by the loan association
The borrower is subject, to the
same requirements and restric
tions and the agent is responsi
ble as an endorser. The agent
receives one half of one percent
on the loan, and whatever ex
penses that must be incurred in
appraising and abstracting and
recording the deed must be paid
by the borrower as is the case
with the association, and is
collectible from' the. dividends
payable to the borrower on his
stock in the land bank.
Loans Made Through Joint
Stock Banks
The joint stock land mortgage
bank is organized just as any
other incorporated bank but
comes under the supervision of
the Federal Land Bank Board.
The government takes no stock
in- it Its profits are the same
as the profits allowed "the Farm
Land Banks one percent over
the rate paid by it on the bonds
which it sells, based on the
mortgages it receives. Its pow
ers" and restrictions are in the
main the same as those of the '
Farm Land Banks. It takes the
place of ' the Farm Land Bank
and the Loan Association, or the
agent which the Land Bank may
have appointed. All of the
agencies mentioned, Loan Asso
ciations, agents, and the joint
stock land banks, may operate
in the same territory. This
might happen where the agent
was appointed before an associa
tion was formed. The capital
stock of the joint stock land
bank must be at least $250,000.
It must not sell - bonds in excess
of fifteen times its capital and
surplus. It can make loans for
any purpose to anybody, in any
amounts, neither of which is
allowed by the other methods.
Adjustment to State Laws
In case of default of payment
of an installment by the borrow
er the loan association, or agent,
must pay in cash or bonds with
in thirty days. It is then up to
the ' association to" collect from
the individual whose mortgage
was turned over to the associa
tion. Should the association de
fault it is declared insolvent and
a receiver is appointed and pro
ceedings are then under orders
from the Farm'Loan Board. '
The Farm Loan Commissioner,
the executive officer of the Fed
eral 'Farm Loan Board, is to
make examination of the state
laws relating totha
and recording ot land titles, and
the foreclosures of mortgages or
other instruments securing loans
and relative points. A report
will be compiled for use in the
various states. A great deal of
confusion will result from the
multiplicity of state regulations
on those points which could be
avoided by the general adoption
of the Torrens system of land
registration. This law is now in
force in quite a number of
states, including Mississippi, but
it is virtually a dead letter be
cause of the expense and time
required to comply the law.
However when once a piece of
land is thus registered the
pledging of a farm under the
rural credit law . would be so
simple that none would worry
oyer the requirements. The ex
pense in registering under the
Torren law is but little more if
any than the expenses which
would have to be paid in meet
ing the requirements of the rural
credit law, and in the Torrens
registration the state forever
guarantees the title,
All debts under . the rural
credits law are to be paid by the
amortization plan. This plan is
in vogue wherever rural credits
are in operation. It is a system
of paying off debts by install
ments of equal amount; each
payment including the accured
interest and a part of the princi
pal. The extension of the time,
and the lowering of the interest
through the sale of bonds offers
the land-owning farmers that
which should make for rural
betterment

Suffered For
Twenty Years
"Smothering Spells Almost Set
Me Wild," He Says -Takes
Tanlac and Says He Is Now
Well and Strong.
"For twenty years I have
suffered with catarrh in my head
and . throat. Everybody who
knows me, and I know a great
many of people, know this to be
a fact," said C. P. Cartwright,
who lives in Alton Park, Chatta
nooga, Tenn.
"Every night my head would
be so stopped up I could hardly
breathe, and I would have a
choking feeling and shortness of
breath that nearly drove me
wild. I guess I had catarrh of
the stomach, too, because I had
indigestion most of the time. In
fact, I have not had a well day
for years, and have been so
nervous and restless I simply
dreaded to see night come, be
cause I could not steep, and to
tell the truth, I was so weak and
run-down I have nQt been able
to do any work for I don't know
how long. No kind of medicine,
and I took nearly everything,
seemed to help me a particle
until I heard of this Tanlac. My
son-in-law induced me to try it,
and he had been hearing lots
about it.
"I have used two bottles of
this medicine, and am proud to
say I believe I am as well and
wr-w 1 was. " Mfap
petite and . digestion have im
proved and I am gaining right
along. I sleep good at night
and can breathe fine. I no long
er have those choking, smother
ing sensations like I used to
have.
"Everybody certainly ought to
know about this medicine, for it
surely has done wonder 3 for me.
The only thing I hate is that I
did not hear about it years ago,
as I believe it would have saved
me lots of suffering."
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in Houlka exclusively by J.
W. HOWARD & SON.
Convenient.
Estate Agent (exhibiting property
to prospective tenants) And then this

the slightest need of equipping It with
expensive clocks to tell the time a

ALL WRONG
The Mistake Is Made by Many Oko
lona Citizens.
Look for the cause of backache.
To be cured you must know the
cause. -
If it's weak kidneys you must set
the kidneys working right.
An Okolona resident tells you how.
J. W. Sanders, carpenter, Washing
ton School Sts., Okolona, says: 'I
was bothered by backache and sharp
pains across my kidneys. My back
was so weak and lame, it hurt me to
lift anything. I finally used Doan's
Kidney Pills and a couple of boxes
cured me. From that day to this, a
lapse of five years, I have worked
hard and have never felt the least,
trouble with my back and kidneys."
- Price 50c. at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
cured Mr. Sanders. Foster-Milburn

Great Discovery Despised.
Harvey's theory of the circulation
ot the blood was considered so ridicu
lous, at the time of the discovery, that
for ten years not a single patient con
sulted him.
