Senator Chamberlain ran the gamut
of legislation that baa hern enacted

CLEAR OF TRAP
SET BY ENEMIES
IMkesvllie, ,V. J., Oct. 12 . -Kepuli-llcnn
Candidate Hughe I determined
not to uiake any anewer to the charge
that he repreaenta the German-
Amerlran vote. lie regard hlmielf
a potentially a prealdent. He hold
it hi duty nekher by word or deed
to walk Into any trap which hall
aeem tocommlt hlin, a man who may
be choaen In November to dictate
America' poeltlon toward the world,
to any apeetnc eoiirae of action with
regard to European pollcle.
The f'nlted Hrnea presenta thl ex
planation of 11 iir he' attitude, by per
mission, today:
When Hughe dlacuaae and con
demn the British blockade, It I not
with the Idea of any anlmu a mil nut
England. When he hit at the sub
marlne warfare and the Wllaon ad
mlnUtrstlon' handling of that Issue,
he doea not apeak with a mind binned
against Germany. He ipeaka a one
who regarda America' opportunity,
a the grealeat of neutral nation, the
moat momentous to America herself
and to the other nation of the world.
In establishing firmly the principle of
neutrality."
To thoae with whom he talked on
the atibject Hughe ha added to thl
statement of hi poult Ion the follow
ing: "America umsl leave no atone un
turned to enforce agalnat any nation
her right a a world power. By ao
doing, the United Statea not only
maintain her own dignity a a na
tion, but she eatabliihe more firmly
the principle of Justice contained In
International law. International law,
the governor hold, I not a fixed unit
It I a collection of principle to which
nation subscribe. Tboite principle
become fixed only when wine great
nation establishes their J nut Ire and
falrnew by demand, unflinchingly
maintained, for their fullest obser
vance. If the United State can ac
cept thl fixation of principle of In
ternational law by holding all nation
strictly accountable to the spirit of
the now only nebulou principle of
International law, America will have
her opportunity to become foremost
among the world power."
The republican candidate, It Is aald
for him. feela very atrongly the de
licacy of hie poeltlon a presidential
candidate In this time when Interna
tional law Is in the making. He I
extremely resentful of any Jockeying
by either his friends or his political
foe which attempt to align him with
either the central allle or the entente
powers. He doe not desire In any
utterance to mention the name of a
slngle'one of the warring powers lest
om Incorrect deduction be made
from that mention.' But In every
speech from now on he expect to re
iterate In emphatic language .hla dis
avowal that he has any understanding
or agreements or Intrigues with any
body. INKKCTKD BWKOT8 ARK

World's Championship Title
Annexed for the Fourth

Brave', Field, Boston, Oct. 12.
Before th greateet crowd that ever
witnessed a professional baseball
game, th Boston Red Sox annexed
their fourth world' championship
this afternoon. A vaat throng, num
bering 42,20 wlld-yed fane, saw the
Sox down the Brooklyn Dodgers, four
to one, in th fifth gam of the 1116
title struggle. It registered the Sox-
fourth victory and clinched the title
for them.
To Ernie Shore, elongated right
hander or the Sox. went the honor of
stowing away the championship. He
is tne only pitcher to be credited with
two victories In the aeries.
The title chub. In addition to furn
ishing the longest world's champion
ship gsme on record in the 14-innlng
contest her Monday, was also one
Of the richest In history. The receipts
for today'a game alone were 183,872.
and th total receipt for the flv
game were 2385.5S0.50. Of this
amount each club received 192,052.02
as It shsre. The national commis
sion reaped a total or $S8,55.05. The
players' share was $162,927.45. Sixty
per cent of this goes to Boston and
40 per cent to Brooklyn, to be divided
among the player eligible for the

themselves ee fit.
Today's game did not measure no
to the crowd. At best It waa only
ordinary, and in some places It was
weird.- The great crowd really did
not turn Itself loose until the gam
was over. Thousands then flooded
down on the diamond In the wake of
a band which loudly tooted "Teade,"
and after marching around the field
massed tn front of the players bench

LLOYD-GEORGE IN
ANSWER TO CRITICS
London, Oct 12. Lloyd-George's
crushing rejoinder to. Richard HoH.
one of hi critics, In the house of com
mons yesterday received equal atten
tion from the newspapers today with
Premier Asqulths statement that
there must be no "precarlou and
dishonoring compromise msde under
tne name or peace."
Holt criticised the war secretary'
recent statement on peace to the
United Press. He complained that
Lloyd-George need sporting term.
Ilk the now famon 'knockout." giv
ing th Impression that tils statements
were compromising, and that the
minister was not the proper person
to express the government's attitude
on foreign policies.
Turning directly toward Holt,
Lloyd-George said:
"Wbat you really object to Is not
really the, manner, but the pith and
purport of this Interview."
Lloyd-George added that he waa
Imply elaborating what the British
and French prim ministers had said
and what the cabinet and military ad
viaera believed. He spoke with Im
Ipresslv emphasis when he said he
wnned he were at liberty to "tell the
honorable member bow timely the
Interview was on It appearance."
Th London paper particularly
emphaaii Lloyd -George' declaration
that th interview waa timely and es
sential, and not merely a personal ex
pression, but the opinion of the cab
inet and war committee and also of
England' allies.
"Between these words," said th
Dally Telegraph, referring to the ref
erence to th timelines of th Inter
view, "even the dullest Imagination
can read. Plainly th Interview wa
expressly timed to kill an Intended
attempt at Intervention, and It suc
ceeded there's no need to say
whr." . .
The general Impression wa today
that In making this quick retort to his
critic Lloyd -George affectively
scotched a boatile clique which,
though small. Is somewhat mischie
vous. At the same time he thoroughly
justified th propriety of cabinet min
isters giving interviews when the oo
caslon demands. Lloyd-George's
Rooeeveltlan epigram that an Inter
view ta "a public report of a private
conversation," was considered espe
cially happy.

Copenhagen, Oct 12. King Otto
of Bavaria, Europe' "mad king,''
died suddenly at the castle of Fuer
tenrled. where he has been oonfiaed.
insane, for several year.
The "mad king of Bavaria," about '
70 years old at th time of his death, 1
startled Europe by bis eccentricities
before he waa declared Incapable of
ruling on November S, 1212, and was
succeeded by bl cousin. King Lud
wig III. He bad nominally succeeded
his brother. King Ludwlg II, in K
when Lud wis committed suicide by
throwing himself into a lake daring
a fit of Insanity. His uncle, the re
gent, Lultpold, was, however, the real
ruler of Bavaria.. During the Franco
Prussian war, Otto first showed anno
toms of insanity when he called out
a squad of cavalry to charge straight
at atone wall. The wall, be said,
was a body of French Infantry. Then
he wa eommonedi- by th epar t -headquarter
and it was reported let
ters were ' found in his possession
offering to make peace with France. ,
He wa then put under a medical es
cort. Several year ago the "mad
king" was imprisoned In the Faer
stenrled castle. Though tn the midst
of rich furnishing, he Is reported to
have lived like a savage, refusing to ,
have his hair or nails cut, and avoid
ing water and aoap. For days fee
would refuse food, imagining it to be
poisoned. His attendants finally per
suaded him to eat by pretending; to
hide food about the palac. The "mad
king" then "discovered" the food,
and, believing it had been bidden by
the servants to satisfy their own ap
petites, ate It with the greatest relish.
He waa passionately fond of grand
opera, summoned well known singers
to his castle prison, and often spent
daya listening to operas. : On April '
27 of each year Otto was examined ,.
by a government commission, charged
wHh the duty ot reporting on his
sanity. A few years ago he became
seriously ill from a carbuncl on bjs
neck, and was believed to be dying.
