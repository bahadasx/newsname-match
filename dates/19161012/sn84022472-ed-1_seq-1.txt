ADAMS EXPRESS
TRUNKS LOOTED
BY CLEVER THIEF
$2,000 Worth of Stolen
Goods Recovered For
tune in Property Stolen
WHOLESALE ROBBERY
COVERS YEAR PERIOD
Trace Missing Merchandise
To Boston, New York
and Pennsylvania.
The baffling and1 mysterious thefts
of Jewels and goods, totaling in value
thousands offlollars, from trunks and
travelling bags, shipped from the main
offices of the Adams Express Co. in
this city, Boston New York and Phil
adelphia, has - been .solved by the
Bridgeport police.
It was learned today that as a result
of the arrest of Leo Gallagher of Bos
ton, in this city, a few days ago by
Detectives Dooley "and Bray, over 12,
00O worth; of 'property belonging to
patrons of the express company has
already been recovered, and the au
thorities have information which they
believe will lead to the restoration of
valuables and immense quantities of
other properties to the owners.
For more than a year trunks ship
ped by the Adams Express Co., have
been Indiscriminately looted,, travel
ing bags' have been opened and rifled
and trunks containing merchandise
and jewelry of great value have mys
teriously disappeared. .
, All efforts to solve the thefts failed,
until last week, when a black trunk
containing articles valued at $400, was
redirected from its owner in Boston,
to Leo Gallagher, a roomer In Fast
Main street. The local office of the
express company; had complained to
Lieut. S. Q. Cronan, of losses sustain
ed, shortly after Gallagher had enter
ed, their employ. . j .
Getting on the trail of the black
trunk. Detectives Bray and Dooley ar
rested' Gallagher, - a fine appearing
young man, of good education. .Inves
tigation showed the trunk had been
stolen froib Boston, and that Gallag
her had -worked for the Adams Bx
press company in the latter city. New
York and Philadelphia.
Tien came to light the extensive
thefts from, the company covering a
period bf more than a year and. the
subsequent loss of goods worth a for
tune. Gallagher was turned over to
the Boston police for trial. Informa
tion wormed from him by the detec
tives leading to the recovery of mer
chandise. In New 'York, Boston and
other cities, where Gallagher is believ
ed to have shipped trunks, and valu
ables to pals. f
Dozens of finely manufactured
skeleton keys of every size and vari
ety, which would open any style trunk
loci or traveling bag, were found in
Gallaghers room by "Detective, Bray
and Dooley.
Gallagher would apply to' the ex
press company for a Job as porter, al
ways obtaining the postion. He would
scan the" various v trunks and picking
one he believed to contain the most
valuable merchandise or Jewelry he
would wheel it behind a -load of other
baggage, open it with his skeleton keys
and help himself to the contents, pur
suing the same method in rifling' trav
elling bags. J .
If Jthe contents of a trunk were ex
ceedingly bulky, he would attach a
new tag containing the address W a
pal after ripping off the rightful own
ers name, and have the trunk ship
ped to his accomplices. It is expect
ed that the trail of Gallaghers opera
tians will lead the police to cities as
far south as Philadelphia. .

How to build a six family house on
a 35 foot lot was explained this morn
ing by ' Jacob Levy, who told three
commissioners In the superior court
how the tenement problem is handled
in the West End. Levy, who is a
West End real estate dealer and owns

it was the eustom to arrange three
room llats. The houses were extend

a year, - '
He was called as a witness in the

IS KEPT BY MANY
Affecting Scenes as Soldiers
Greet Relatives on
Detraining. v
Hartford, Oct. 12 Thousands of
persons, jamming every inch of
ground in and around the Union sta
tionhere, gave a mighty welcome this
noon to the First Connecticut infantry,
returning from fgfir months' duty at
the Mexican border.
Business in the city was at a stand
still while the big demonstration was
on. The khaki-clad soldiers were
pounced upon by watting Telatives"and
friends as they detrained at tha sta
tion, and it was only after many min
utes' delay they were formed - into
marching" columns in the streets. '
, Mayor Frank A.' Hagerty and the
civic reception committee were wait
ing at the station when the train ar
rived. So was the; Firs Company,
Governor's Foot Guards :the official
escortf or the . home-coming troops
and 'so were several thousands- of
others. Hundreds of folks had stayed
up all night to await the soldiers' re
turn. " ' . :
When the lines' were finally "formed,
the soldiers marched to, the armory,
where a luncheon was v served. An
army of workers had labored all night
getting things ready for the soldiers.
There . were . hundreds , of pounds of
roast leef and salads, thousands of
sandwiches and almost unending
quantities of ice cream and coffee.
Those . who had'' kept an all-night
vigil and he thousands wfi joined
them in the early morning were get
ting a bit discouraged . this forenoon.
There, had been many false alarms
announcing the "immediate, arrival"
of the troops. Finally. v the. signal
came at 10:38' o'clock. . ' ' ; - -
, The throng at the south end of the
platform saw the colors being waved
from the wihdow of a car- rounding
the bend. In another instant hun
dreds of flags answered from the plat
form Snd thousands from the street
below as the troops were recognized.
The troops detrained on the platform,
A readjustment of the waiting rela
tives and friends followed, and the
Union Statiqn, already packed, was
almost swallowed up by the' rush.
The First Company, Governor's
Footguard, with its band, waiting only
for the signal left its resting place
at the corner of Spruce and Asylum
street and moved opposite Bushnell
Park, Mayor Frank A. Hagerty and
the reception committee, stepping In
to line, - "
The' troops, almost pushed off the
platform by eager friends, fell In, with
difficulty, and marched down the plat
form to Asylum street.
. It was no easy task to form parade
ranks. Mothers and sisters and sweet
hearts came before orders. - And if
some1 mothers and wives and sweet
hearts did not, break Into the ranks
to greet their1 own, restrained perhaps
by timidity, the boys who had. been
breathing Arizona sand for weeks,
took matters in their own hands. They
went right into the crowd for their
greetings. Sone climbed Into automo
biles and kissed the whole family.
The men marched through- Ford
and Trinity streets and , Capitol ave
nue to the- state armory where, they
will he quartered until mustered out.
The second and third section' of the
regiment are expected this afternoon.

Bayonne, N. J.. Oct. 12 The streets
approaching the Constable Hook sec

armed famp. Thousands of strikers
from the plants of the Standard Oil
Co., Tidewater Oil Co., , Vacuum Oil
Co., PaciBc Coast 1 Borax Co. and the
General Chemical had established a
"dead line" across the approaches to
those plants. , ,
Inside this line between the strikers
and the oil plaYits, nearly 100 police
men were stationed in a Are engine
house' guarding the plants from at
tack while a few other policemen and
75 deputy sheriffs held possession of
headquarters.
There were no signs of cessation of
the labor war which caused the clash
yesterday of polica and strikers in
which one woman spectator Was kill
ed and 15 or 20 strikers were wound
ed. This fight took place, according
to the police, when the strikers inter
fered with the firemen attempting to
fight a blaze and cut the hose.
About 12.000 men have quit work
in various plants at Constable Hook
and virtually have besieged the police
headquarters and fire .station. The
police were able to move about the

NAVY DEPT;READY,
TO KEEP NEUTRAL
WATERS GUARDED
Washington, Oct. 12. While no im
mediate steps are in contemplation for
the ' afetual establishment of a naval
neutrality patrol along the Atlantic .
coast as a result of the German sub
marine raid, the navy department naa
completed a definite plan to put Into '
operation if the campaign continues,
vjjhe entire destroyer force.active and
reserve, assisted by light cruisers, navyi
tugs and other auxiliary craft, would
be employed Jo protect American ter
ritorial waters and prevent establish
ment of any secret bases ashore or
communication between' snore 'radio
station and belligerent craft. '
The possibility of mobilizing the.
force of trfvately owned motor boats
along the coast, which have been en
rolled with their crews as a part "of
the naval reserve, was first considered,
but various obstacles were encoun
tered. Naval militia officers and men '
already have, been assigned to reserve
ships for service if necessary. , ' ;
SUBMARINE RAID ;
OFFERS PROBLEM
FOR
sta
E DEPT.
Washington; Oct. 12. State depart
ment officials today were pandering
the question of whether the United
States shall acknowledge the raid of "
the Gbrtnan war submarine U-Si on.
allied shipping off Nantucket last Bun
day, as legal. The problem was con- '
sldered of great importance not only
in Its relation-to that particular raid,
but because of the probability that it
will . establish a precedent affecting
possible future submarine forays of
similar nature; . , - 1
,Much forethought was being given to
potential developments, such as that
German undersea boats might be able:
to extend their operations to. such an'
extent as to effect practically a block-j
ade of American ports or that the al-j
lied powers might decide tq press
harder their demand that entry. Into.
American ports be denied ail Minder
water craft of belligerents." Resting,
on determination of this nation's atti
tude toward the work of the U-5S Is
the matter" of soliciting indemnity or
American cargoes lost with the sunken1,
ships. Only If the ships were sunk 11-'
legally may Qlalms . be entered. ' '
The navy department today received;
a report from Rear Admiral Knight at;
Newport, giving detailed accounts from
the commanders of four of the steam
ers sunk by a German: submarine off.
the New England coast Naval of
ficials refused to- comment v upon Its
contents and it will be transmitted to
Secretary Lansing f or'study in connec
tion, with the determination of tha
policy of the United States. The re.
dort was written by Admiral Knight's
aide, who took statements from the
commanders of the. sunken vessels. ;
Rear Admiral Gleaves, commandlag !
the Atlantio destroyer flotilla, repct-;
ed today his personal belief that no,
steamer Kingston or Klngstonian was;
seen by the German submarine during
its . operations off Nantucket light-;
ship. After several days of search,;
the destroyer force has found no. evl-!
dence that a ship of that name wasj
in the vicinity and if Admiral Gleaves' j
theory is correct, only five ships were,
sunk. Admiral Gleaves" report fol-'
lows: 1
I "Destroyers continued the search,
until midnight, Tuesday, from Mon-;
tauk Point to the Nantucket Upht-,
ship. lt is ' my - personal belief that
all survivors have been accounted for
and that there was no steamer Kings

be Kingston. Destroyers havereturn

The captain 'of one of the sunken
ships said he had hailed a passing
vessel which, later destroyed, and un

as Kingstoon. The Knudsen was de
