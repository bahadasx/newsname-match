Mr Maxwell Writes The News
Concerning the article in last weeks
paper entitled Doesnt play the
Sucker 1 wish to state a few facts
Mr Lilly and a young man working
for me as a farm hand were on a deal
for a car on Saturday night On Sun
day morning Mr Lilly came out to
further demonstrate the car as the
young man haid he would probably
buy it While the young man was
examining the car Mr Stark called
Mr Lilly aside and told him that
judging from the young mans talk
and actions he didnt think there was
anything to him and probably he was
a criminal working on a farm awhile
to hide from justice Mr Lilly then
came to mo and asked what I knew of
the young man I told him that be
had come to my farm about three
weeks before inquiring for work and
since that time had been In my em
ploy further than that I knew nothing
of him I also wish to say that I at
no time agreed to stand for the car as
I had nothing to do with the trans
action E L Maxwell

Gone From Ds
Perhaps some day we will meet
again but more than likely we will
never look upon that face again One
has gone from our community who has
oftentimes stood bctweetf our people
and poverty helped to build our
churches our schools brought joy to
our old and young alike has never
shrunk from the duties she had to
perform It was no act of hers that
caused her to roam to other parts she
belonged here and should have re
mained with us but the blame is all
our own we should never have sent her
to the mail order houpe The face up
on that dollar lingers in our memory
still but her cold form lies in the vault
of the mail order house from whence
none return Rockville Booster
