The Increased cost of milk would
be a good thing for the county if It
should lead people to keep goats.
For some reason goat's milk has nev
er been popular in America, altho In
Europe, especially In France, Italy
and Switzerland, it is much esteem
ed, particularly for babies. A goat
can be kept at small expense where
it would be impossible to keep a cow.
Garden waste and roadside browse
will support it. A small shed affords
sufficient shelter. A goat is far
cleaner than a cow, and requires on
ly such care as a child can give it.
Who will get a goat?

The leaves on the big sycamore
had fallen and covered the ground
with a brown carpet, like the one
Johnnie Watklns mother had
bought with her chicken and turkey
money. Johnnie was as proud of the
carpet as was his mother. For
hadn't he stood guard to see where
Mother Turkey had hidden her nest,
while MotherTurkeyactedas tho she
was In no hurry and had the whole
morning before her?
But any boy is proud when he
helps his mother.
When Father and Mother Quail
decided to go to housekeeping, and
raise a great big family of children,
each one no larger at first than Tom
mie Tomkins' thumb, they selected
a nice place in the orchard close to
Johnnie's house. Johnnie could hear
Father Quail as he sat on the fence-
post whistle, "Bob-White," Bob
White." But now his song has
changed, for you know the quail has
a spring as well as a winter song. He
is a different sort of. a fellow In the
winter from what he is in the
spring. He knows that the sports
man with his dog that can smell a
quail from one end of the orchard to
the other will soon be around. His
call changes from "Bob-White" to
very careful and anxious call, like
mother has when little sister goes
too near the open well or cistern
The quail has lots of trouble keeping
the little fellows from harm.
First, it is Brother Hawk that
1
swoops down, and when Mother
Quail calls the roll that night there
is one little chirp that fails to an
swer.
Brother Fox is always meddling
around, too, for he likes young
quail as well as Johnnie likes pie.
Right here is a chance for any lit
tle boy to learn a lesson from the
quail. They are regular in their hab
its as the old clock that stands in
the corner, which grandfather
brought with him when he settled
on the farm years ago. At six in
the morning, while Johnnie sits be
hind the stove on the woodbox In
the kitchen watching mother get
breakfast, the quail family 'is Just
starting to breakfast '.o the nearby
corn field. At 8:30, as Johnnie is
carrying giater's books and basket to
school for every good boy is
thoughtful of sister Mother Quail
is giving her Hoik a dust-bath. And
they don't fuss and kick, like th3
little boy that visited Johnnie, when
they take a bath. At 12 o'clock as
Johnnie sits on the stlleblocks, eat
ing bis dinner and dividing his pie
with the little boy that hardly ever
has pie, the quail family has reached
the old tree-lap and are taking
their noon-day nap whlle like
grandmother as she sits in the cor
ner and nods with a half-finished
yarn mitten for Johnnie .only you
can't slip up on the quail family, for
some little fellow always has an eye
open and gives the alarm, and the
whirring of wings sounds so loudly
It almost scares a fellow.
I wonder where the quail family
roost at night?" asks Brother Red
Fox of his wife as they lay out on
their front porch, which was nothing
more than the old pond-dam. v "I
don't know, honey," replies Mother
Fox, "but I have a scheme. We will
trail them .to their roost."
So that evening just as Johunle's
father was milking old Bossy Cow,
Father and Mother Red Fox ' left
their three little babies, after telling
them not to go over to the naughty
