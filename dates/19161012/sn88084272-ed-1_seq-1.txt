American league team this afternoon when the Bostons defeated the
Brooklyn National leaguers in the fifth game of the series by a score of 4 to I.
It was the fourth victory of the Red Sox, who won the first, second, fourth
and fifth games. The Brooklyns won the third.
I The Dodgers of Brooklyn were powerless today before the superb pitch
ing of Shore, who was responsible for a string of outs. He was brilliantly
supported by his team mates and the Red Sox batsmen came up to the emer

Pfeffer was in the box for Brooklyn when the game opened, but the Boston
men got to him early, scoring three runs in the first three innings of play.
The total attendance today was 42,620. The crowd was the largest
that ever witnessed a world's series game.
The sun shone brightly and helped
temper the chilling wind which blew
over the Charles river. The two teams
came early to the grounds and had a
long batting practice. Larry Gardner,
