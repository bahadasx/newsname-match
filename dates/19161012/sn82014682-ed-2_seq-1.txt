' HOSTON, MaBB., Oct. 12. The
Urooklyn Ship of State sailed into
the . Boston Shore this afternoon
wrecked, with four big holes In her
tide. Another ahlp reached America
exactly 42 years ago today, and Boa
ton la celebrating the arrital of Co
lumlntR this afternoon. The - Boston
Tana- are also celebrating the wreck
ing of the Brooklyn ship on a rok
lonnd ahore.
For the fourth time In the history
of tho came .tno Boston Americans
are -World . Cbjuaplona." They defeaE
pd the Brooklyn team this afternoon
by la score of 4 to 1, giving Boston
four victories out of five Boston has
now won more world championships
than any other Amerimn League
team.
Shore Is the Hero , -
It was the -work of a tall youth from
South Carolina who was responsible
for the swan-song -of. the Robins in
Boston town today. This tall youth,
w ho extends "up Into the ethereal
waves a distance of 6 feet G inches,
toyed with the Brooklyn batters this
arternoon. Throughout the nine in
nings he was using-hls fast ball, which
bad a noticeable break to It. and only
three singles were made off hi3 de
livery. These singles were as scat
tered as Icebergs In the middle of the
Atlantic, and Brooklyn never had a
chance from the time .that the umpire
handed Shore a new 'ball and Harry
Myers, another Southerner, walked
out to the plate before more than 40.
ooo fans seated In leaves' field. Shore
was as cool as the proverbial cucum
ber and when Cady let a ball go by
him which meant a run, and Scott
booted the ball, the tall youth from
'-Hast Bend did not weaken.
Brooklyn Jpst because it could not
hit the tall hurler Pfeffer pitched a
great game as world's series games
go. but the Dodgers did not have a
chance with the ball coming, down at
them from such a. height and curved
In every .possible direction. Jake Dath
bert and Zack "Wheat, who have ham
mered the National League pitchers
for an average of more than .300, were
as babes before -the towering heaver
ttt the home team.
In four times to bat Daubert did not
once bit the ball out of the infield,
wliile Shore fanned Wheat on two oc
casions. The Boston pitcher deserved
a shutout It was one of his shoots
that, got away from Cady which gave
Brooklyn the solitary run, without a
hit being made in that Inning.
Stengel, Mowrey and Meyers were
the only Brooklyn Matters to hit. safe
ly, and the trio of bingles did not fig-
- ure in run making. Big Ed Pfeffer
pitched good ball, but his hurling was
- of no avail. Boston bit when runs
were needed, and the six hits off the
big pitcher gave the home folks four
runs, which was more than enough
to win. ' "
Both shortstops ; played far below
their standard this afternoon. Ever
ett Scott made his first error of the
series when he threw Stengel's
grounder away. Olson's two slips in
the third Inning were responsible for
one of the .two runs made. Larry
Gardner was in his element The
.Brooklyn batters kept, bitting drives
down toward the difficult corner, and
the Vermont boy. continued to pick
them up and hurl them to first He
handled six chances without the semb-
lance of an error.
. ' Hooper, and Lewis, the World Scries
Tw ins, were in the limelight ' today.
These two players go along throueh
out the season hitting around .270,
and when the world's series comes
around they are. the men . who come
through in a pinch. With the help of
Janvrin and Shorten today these boys
from Sunny California figured in the
Boston offense. ;

DEADLOCK STILL
Strikebreaking Camp Reopens;
Hawaiians Walk Out After
Getting Fine Breakfast
With 300 more union men'" walking
out at 6:30 this morning, and the
strike-brealclng camp on Pier 16 in
full operation again after having been
discontinued only 24 hours,- striking
union stevedores and employers are
deadlocked today. There seems no
prospect of any settlement at this
time.
. All the trouble is over the question
of the employment of union Japanese
stevedores by McCabe, Hamilton &
Renny. The stevedoring firm is stand
ing pat, holding that it will' employ
whoever it sees fit regardless of the
union and will not be dictated to by
the union strikers. The union men
are also marking time, claiming they
have plenty of money in their relief
fund to buy fish and poi, and are able
to hold out indefinitely until their de
mand that the stevedoring firm cease
discriminating against union Japanese
is granted. .
Strike-Breakers' Camp Reopens
At 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Jack Belser was instructed by the
committee of shippers to reopen the
strike-breaking ramp on Pier 16 and
prepare to care for hundreds .of strike
breakers. By 6 o'clock this morning
there were several hundred Filipinos
and Japanese strike-breakers in the
enclosure ready to go to work.
Hawaiian Quit After Breakfast .
At about this hour between 200 and-
S00 stevedores, mostly union Hawaii

Pier 16 . for a chance to go to work.
Most of them were admitted to the
camp and given a hearty breakfast
While .they were eating someone in
the crowd spread the news that all
