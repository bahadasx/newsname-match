DREW BIG CROWD
HOW TO GET GOOD
WATER FOR WILLIAMS
The quality of William's water
is responsible, no doubt, for the
fact that a petition has been
signed by a large number of
Williams citizens asking that an
election be called to vote on a
franchise for a company which
proposes to bring water from
the San Francisco mountains
and sell it to Williams. This
company might better the water
which Williams is now obliged
to use, but the News doubts if it
will, even if it gets the franchise.
. Granting that the company can
- tret water of the quality promis
ed, the expense of delivering it
to Williams will be enormous
and the hope of deriving an in
come from the sale of water to
justify the expense of installing
the supply system is so poorly
founded that the News believes
Williams would better not be
come interested m the proposi
tion. To the News it looks like
a proposition to involve our Town
in a scheme to float securities
that promoters may make a
killing.
A Better Way
Go up Cataract Canyon to a
point 300 feet above the Water
and Electric Co's. dam and at
this particular time you will find
a small stream of clear, cold
spring water flowing down the
canyon quite different from the
water one sees in the mudhole3
from which all Williams water
is drawn. The News says. . mud-
holes not as a reflection on any
one, but because mudholes - the
tanks must all be with mud
bottoms and sides. The appeal
ance of the water is evidence
that mud is carried in suspen
sion. Compare these reservoirs
with those which hold the water
supplied to Flagstaff and you
will agree that the News is not
in error in referring to Williams
water as coming from mudholes.
Flagstaff water as seen in the
reservoirs is clear. One can see
to the bottom tho the .water is
many feet deep.
But to return to Cataract Can
yon: The stream which one sees
at this time will not be running
during dry weather but there is
good reason to believe that there
. is an under-flow percolating thru
the bed of the canyon which
might be intercepted and piped
to a reservoir below and which
would compare favorably with
the water which make3 Flagstaff
famous. To this constant under
flow could be added such part of
the annnal surface fllow provid
ed by snow and rain as might be
desirable. Altogether, the a
mount of water furnished would
be all that Williams would need
for year3 to come and probably
for all time.
The Question of Storage
: The News has referred to the
bodies of water stored in the
canyon above the Town as mud
holes. . The News proposes that
. Williams;, water shall not come
. from mudholes, but on the con
trary from a reservoir with ;
concrete bottom and walls, water
tieht. so that the water stor ed
therein would be as (clear as the
spring water which is now. runn
ing down the canyon and with
which together with outside
snow and rain water, the reser
voir might be filled. This reser
voir, located preferably higher
ud the canyon than the tank of
the Williams Water Co. for the
purpose of netting greater head,
should be large enough to holcL.

of water. Then with a concrete
Babbitts Entertain Employes
.Tudee Holub, F. O. Udine,
Adolph Boenitsch, C. H. Apple-
ton, Dick Connors and M. H.
Mansfield attended the Depart
ment Managers' meeting of the
Babbitts stores at Flagstaff Sun
day. A delegation of Babbitt
employes was up from Winslow
and the occasion was made one
of great interest. The Flagstaff
Babbitt establishment was visit
ed thruout by the visiting dele
gations and then they were tak
en in automobiles to various
points of interest in the Town.
All had dinner at the Commercial
hotel after which toasts were
drunk, Mr. Quinlan, general
manager of the Winslow store,
acting as toast master. Ad
dresses were made by Mr. Chas.
Fairfield, office manager at Win-
slow, and Mr. Daze, postmaster
of Winslow.
The meeting was for the pur
pose of calling Babbitt employes
together for mutual acquaint
ance in the interest of the Bab
bitt business. The Williams
delegates report a fine time and
each returned to his post enthusi
astically determined to make the
Williams business still better. .

Fred Holden has lived in
Northern Arizona more than 30
vears and he has lived in Coco
nino county since its organiza
tion. He knows what the
county needs and he knows what
the west side needs. He can be
depended upon to do what is
ris-ht intelligently and well. Be
iner the only west side candidate
he should have west side support
regardless of politics and should
have east side support because
the west side is entitled to a
Supervisor.
Sneak Thieves Busy
The democratic rally last .Friday
night drew a big and enthusiastic
crowd. The Sultana theatre was
well filled with people who seemed
to get great enjoyment out of these
speeches. The points made were
well received and enthusiastically
applauded. Governor Hunt as rirBt
speaker made a good showing of
accomplishments of his adminis
tration. The expense of govern
ment in Arizona will compare
favorably with that -of government
in other states. The state govern
ment is doing more for the people
than the territoral government was
able to do but the per capita ex
pense is no more. Governor Hunt
and his colaborers are holding Ari
zona m the forefront with respect ,
to progressiveness and his account
ing was accepted as reliable and
satisfactory.
Other state officers made brief
speeches. The talk of Jesse Boyce,
Williams own particular candidate
was very well received, indeed.
Jesse has a warm place in the
hearts of Williams people as will
appear when the November count
is made.
Carl Hayden, Arizona's congress
man, spoke briefly but quite to the ,
point. He remarked the difference
between the non partisan attitude
of the national equal suffrage '- asso
ciation and the very partisan " pro
republican attitude of the so-called
woman's qarty.
The speech of the evening, how
ever, was made by Senator Henry
Asburst. Dunbar claims that
Ashurst will be one of the big
senators . in his nexuterm. ; His ;
speech Friday night would; make .,;
it appeir very probable. One Wil-.
liams man claims that Ashurst is a
better speaker than-the peerless
Bryan. He is certainly in the
same class. Arizona nas reason
to' feel proud of her junior senator
and she will show her pride in him ;
by returning him to th6 senate. -
The last speaker was Hon.. Wiley,
Jones. Arizona's attorney general.-
Tho suffering from a cold and quite
under the weather. Mr. Jones made
a rattling good speech and brought
the house down repeatedly. His
reelection will scarcely be contested..
The meeting wa3 called together
by the Barnes Boys band which
played several selections in front ,
of the theatre. ;
The chirman of the meeting,
was Col. W. M. Hughes who pre
sided with dignity and - introduced
the speakersvery appropriately.
Sneak thieves have been show
ing unusual activity the last few
weeks. Miss Anderson on her home
stead west of town was one of the
first to suffer, losing a number of
fine turkeys which she had raised at
the cost of much labor and expense.
The thieves left one turkey so bad
ly imuredJ that it died. Mies An
derson pays they are welcome to it
too if they will "call for It.
Last week the-'Owetta ranch south
of town, was visited and automo
bile tires, some harness and tools
were taken. The officers were can
ed . after the loss was discovered,
but were unable to find any good
clue to the identity of the tfeieves.i
The last depredation- Teportea
was at the Geo. RounsevHle ranch.
Small articles amounting to a con
siderable valuation were taken.
All of tfc.6 thefts hare been com
mitted while the proprietors have
been absent from the premises.
. These thefts shoald serve as a
warning to ranchers not to leave
anything of valoe in their ranch
houses while vacant, until .these
I thieves are caught.
Mrs. M. C. Smith and three
children surprised Bony and Will
iams friends Monday morning, by
an unannounced appearance in
Williams. Phoenix is, doubtless,
a good place to live in but one who
has had the pleasure of residing in
Williams can hardly become re
conciled vo the change. Mrs.
Smith is now looking for a house.
