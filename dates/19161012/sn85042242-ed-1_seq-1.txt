Fine Building
STRUCTURE OF HANDSOME
COLONIAL TYPE PLANNED
Design Will be Unique and Dis­
tinctive—Construction to Be-
gin in Spring
Plans for a public library of attrac­
tive colonial design, unique and dis­
tinctive in architecture of this type,
have been accepted by the Public Li­
brary commission for Bismarck's
$25,000 Carnegie library, work upon
which is expected to begin early in
the spring. Frederick W. Keith of
the Webb block is the successful ar­
chitect, and his plans have met with
approval from prominent library
authorities at the University and else­
where, as well as the favor of the lo­
cal commission.
Description of Building.
Of pure colonial type, appropriately
preserving the early traditions in
American architecture, the building
which will grace the corner of Thayer
and Sixth streets will present a com­
manding front elevation, with high
pitched roof, massive chimneys at
either end, and entrance and windows
carrying out the colonial scheme. The
building will be faced with red brick,
trimmed with gray Bedford stone.
The main floor will be elevated about
six feet above the lot level, and will
be approached by a broad flight of
steps. The basement will be well
lighted on all sides, giving the ad­
vantage of two floors almost equally
desirable in all respects.
The Interior.
The main doors open upon a hall­
way, with stairs descending to the
basement on the right and a cloak
room on the left. This in turn gives
way into a central delivery rooms,
with librarian's desk commanding an
unobscured view of a large reading
room, 20 by 29 feet, oto the-left, and
a children's room of equal size, on
the right. The desk is flanked on the
left by a reference room, 13 by 18,
and on the left by the librarian's of­
fice, 12 by 13. At the rear are the
book stacks, which may be extended
at the back without interfering with
the remainder of the building. The
walls will be finished in plaster, in
light tints, and there will be white
woodwork, carrying out the colonial
idea. The floors will be of hardwood,
with cork carpets where necessary.
Real Community Center.
With a view to making the library
a real community center, one-half the
basement is devoted to a lecture
room, 20 by 43 feet, with an elevated
rostrum and seats for 210, from which
there opens a kitchenette which may
be used in serving refreshments. A
large central hall occupies the center
of the basement, and to the right of
this are a study room, 14 by 15, for
the use of students, the library staff's
work room, a fuel room and a boiler
room, 13.6 by 17.
Conforms With Requirements.
The plans conform with the require­
ments of the Carnegie Library bureau
and at the same time get away from
the stereotyped classical design,
which in a building of this size is in­
clined to give a "squatty" appearance.
There are to be two entrances to the
lecture room, one on Sixth street in
addition to the general entrance, eith­
er of which may be used without in­
terference with the library proper.
The library building will face north
on Thayer street and will be sur­
rounded by a small grass plot.
To Include Everything.
Architect Keith's estimates are de­
signed to deliver the building, com­
pletely equipped and with all furni­
ture, at not to exceed the amount ap­
propriated by the Carnegie Library
commission, i. e., $25,000.
To Begin Work in Spring.
Owing to the lateness of the season
and the further fact that local con­
tractors have so much work that they
cannot be induced to even glance at
a set of plans, work on the new li­
brary is not expected to begin until
early spring.

Washington, Oct. 11.—The reply of
the French government to the protest
of the United States government
against intereference with the mails
has reached Washington and prob­
ably will soon be laid before the
state department. Its delivery to Sec­
retary Lansing probably will be de­
layed until it and the British reply
can be presented simultaneously.
OPENS BIJOU LUNCH ROOM.
A bijou lunch room has been open­
ed by B. B. Ferguson in the little
room on west Main street formerly
occupied by the Caragus Mfg. com­
pany offices. Mr. Ferguson is an ex­
perience restaurateur, and he has
transformed the place into a very
cosy little eating house.

FIRST PHOTO OF THE U-S3!
The first photo of the German submarine, the U-53, which, with other submarines, has brought the war ro the coast of the United States. The U-53 is here shown as she looked
in the harbor of Newport, R. I., flying the German flag and with officers and crew on deck. Officers said the U-boat is one of the largest of the German war submersibles. It was
a monster compared to the United States submarine, D-2, which was nearby. The 17-53, entirely unheralded, bobbed up at Newport Saturday, dispatched a message to the German
embassy at Washington and departed, without asking for repairs or taking on a pound of supplies. Shortly afterward reports were received of the sinking of ships and other
reports that followed quickly showed a raid was on that probably would be the most extensive and destructive of the entire war..

INVESTIGATING ALL
SUBMARINE RUMORS
Newport, R. I., Oct. 11.—The Amer­
ican navy is taking every precaution
against the use of the American
coast as a ta.se of supplies for foreign
submarines. All day today there was
great activity among the destroyer
flotilla at the naval base here and
when the destroyers McCall, Porter
and Cummings, went out on a myster­
ious mission this afternoon, Rear Ad­
miral Knight, in command of this dis­
trict, was asked if the boats were
searching for a submarine base or
looking up some foreign submarine
tender.
"I cannot answer that," the admiral
stated, "but we are letting no re­
ports of submarine bases or tenders
pass by without investigation."
In an effort to clear up the mystery
concerning the British steamer Kings

the lightship, was asked to forward
what information he had on the mat­

night said:
"Report of sinking was received
when Captain Wilson and crew of
the Strathdene boarded this vessel.
