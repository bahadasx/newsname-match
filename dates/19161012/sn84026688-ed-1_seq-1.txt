An audience of fifteen hundred persons
including many ladies crowded the big
drill shed of the armory at the opening

day night at Frederick under the auspi

Mr. Kendall stated that he did not
come to Frederick to repeat what he had
heard or read but that he came here to
tell of his actual experience under a wet
and dry administration in his native State
He branded as absolutely
untrue advertisements

On the contrary he said every city in
the state had increased its volume of
business from 20 to 25 per cent, since
prohibition went into effect. He told of
the enormous increase in bank deposits
during the past eighteen months that the
State has been dry and he backed up his
assertions with figures obtained after in
terviews with officials of the State and
what he had observed in the bank in
which he is cashier and the other institu
tions with which he is connected.
He said he had read in newspapers that
a man could get all the whiskey he want

a drop.” He said he spent six weeks in
Kansas and did not see a drunken man.
or a man who looked like he ever had ta
ken a drink.
He then took up the situation in West
Virginia and dealt with it from a business,
labor and taxation viewpoint. He said
3,000,000 more tons of coal were mined
in that State during the first dry year
than the previous wet year. Miners, he
declared, were now carrying home food,
clothing and even luxuries, where form
erly they went home drunk. Sixteen
thousand more arrests were made during
the last year liquor was sold than the
first twelve months under prohibition.
In a trip through the State during
the last wet year he counted and
took note of eight hundred and
eighteen men that were drunk. He
went over the same territory during
the first dry year and saw but one
intoxicated man. Criminal expenses
have been reduced sixty per cent,
he said under prohibition. In Graft
on, his home town, twelve regular
policemen assisted at times by extra
policemen were regularly employed
to keep the peace. Since the State
has gone dry but two policemen are
employed.
Question of Taxes.
He dwelt to considerable length
upon the question of taxes. The
$650,000 of liquor revenue was
soon made up from other sources
he said and the State tax rate was
reduced to 14 cents on the SIOO.
He has been informed he said that
next year the rate will be reduced

to 9 cents and that a large surplus
will remain over from all expenses.
He pointed out that the criminal
expenses of the State for the last
wet year was $1,600,000 and he
quoted figures showing enormous
gains in bank deposits during the
first year of prohibition. He said
the tax rate in nearly every county
in the State had been reduced un
der a dry administration. —News
Item.
What Judge Dayton Says:
The Hon. Alston G. Dayton, judge of
the United States District Court for the
Northern District of West Virginia says:
“That prohibition of the liquor traffic
in West Virginia is being effectively en
forced cannot be questioned. That it has
reduced the State’s liquor bill from an
annual sum of more than $15,000,000.00
to less than $500,000.00 is clear. That it
has reduced criminal charges generally
at least 15 per cent, and arrests and fines
for drunkenness and disorderly conduct
fully 75 per cent in the two years it has
been in force in the State cannot be
questioned. ”
Ask Kansas.
From the Central Christian Advocate:
The paid liar of the American Liquor
Dealers’ Association declares that prohi
bition in Kansas is a failure. That must
make it so. But before swollowing his
bunk, it might be well to ask Kansas if
she finds prohibition a failure. For ex
ample, ask the 166 bankers, the 7,000
school teachers, the 700 editors. Ask the
president of the Retail Dealers’ Associa
tion, the president of the State Medical

Read This From Georgia.
Mr. Richard 11. Edmonds, editor of the
Manufactures Record of Baltimore, re
ceived the following telegram, dated Oct.
5,1916, from the same well-thought-of
Mr. White quoted so conspicuously in the
liquor crowd adv. appearing recently:
“My attention has just been called
to certain telegrams received by prom
inent Atlanta citizens apprising them
of the fact that 'whisky interests’
in Baltimore are using as advertising
matter an excerpt from an article
entitled 'A Remarkable Municipal
Fight In Georgia’ appearing in Les
lie’s of September 21st, as an argu
ment against prohibition.
“As author of the article in question
I desire to emphatically protest a
gainst any such misuseof it, any such
distortion of its contents and miscon
struction of my motives. For any in
terest seeking argument for an in
stitution for which there is no argu
ment to lift out only a sentence of an
article such as this is not fair.
“Personally 1 am from sole to crown
a Prohibitionist and I have observed
that in Atlanta and Georgie Prohibi
tion has worked wonders for the pub
lic good. Conditions in Atlanta de
scribed in this article are due solely,
to the best of my light, to political
machinations and official mismanage
ment, and existed to as great extent
as now before Georgie went “dry”
last May. In no wise are they due
to prohibition law enforcement, and
my article did not say nor infer so.

Losing 3,800 A Day.
Brisish losses in September were
at the rate of more than 3,800 a day.
The casualties on all fronts reported
in this month were: Officers 5,439;
men, 114,110.
Heavy as were the British losses
in September, they were lighter than
those of August, which were 127,-

Announcement of the definite date

Amazing War Feature.
The prodical expenditure of shells
is one of the amazing features of the
European war.
The first three weeks of the battle
of the Somme, British gunners min
ed upon the enemy 500,000 shells a
day, or 10,000,000 projectiles in 20
days. Drill Chips, magazine of the
Cleveland Twist Drill Company,
gives 200,000 as the number of shells
daily required hy a respectable ar
tillery force in action.
We talk about 1,000,(XX) men
springing to the country’s defense
between sunrise and sunset. Vision
ary as this is, we overlook the fact
that every million soldiers in the
field, as the American Machinist
points out, calls for 3,000,000 train
ed workers, sweating in the factories
for the support of the army.
Waste Tanbark Now Used To
Make Roofing.
Washington, Get. 11: —A method
for using waste hemlock to partially
replace expensive rag stock in the
manufacture of felt roofing has been
developed at the Forest Products Lab
oratory and is now being used com
mercially hy co-operating mills, ac
cording to an announcement made
hy the Forest Service. It is stated
that, in these mills, from 20 to 30
per cent of the rags is replaced by
waste bark and that the quality of
the finished product is equal to that
manufactured solely from rags.
Members of the Forest Service who
have been conducting the experiments
say that the utilization of the bark
will make it possible to effect a con
siderable saving in the manufacture
of felt roofing.
According to the census of 1909,
over 698,000 tons of hemlock hark
were produced each year in the Unit
ed States. After the tannin is ex
tracted this bark is used for fuel pur
poses, for which it is said to have a
value of 60 cents per ton.
The extent of the savings rendered
possible hy the methods is pointed
out by the fact that the roofing mills
of the United States have a total esti
mated annual production of 237,000
tons of finished roofing of all kinds,
equal to about 11,300,000 squares.
By a square of roofing is meant 100
square feet. The utilization of the
waste bark in this industry should,
it is said, enable the mills to reduce
their manufacturing costs.
In addition to the use of the hark
for roofing, papers made at the For
est Products Laboratory on the basis
of 80 per cent of waste tanbark, have
been successfully printed on a com
mercial twelve-color wall-paper print
ing machine, and give promise of be
ing entirely satisfactory. Other paper
of the same make-up has been made
into fiber conduits by a commercial
manufacturer.
Other possible uses of waste hark
which suggest themselves, say the
Forest Service paper experts, are the
use of hark mixed with ground wood
for the production of wall hoard, or
with sulphite screenings in the man
ufacture of car liners. Studies already
made at the Forest Products Labora
tory indicate that it may be possible
to use waste hemlock and oak tan
hark in making sheathing paper, car
pet liners, bottle wrappers, deaden
ing felt, and the like.

Wall street Is too busy harvesting
Democratic prosperity to go campaign
ing—but it Is sending Us womenfolk.
The greatest aggregation of wealth and
social distinction ever represented by
fuss, feathers and femininity left New
York on Monday, Oct. 2, by special
train de luxe, to tell their sisters
of the West how to vote. Many
of these women, claiming to be equal
suffrage workers, are repudiated by
leaders of that movement.
Stopping at Albany, Utica and Syra
cuse on their flrst day, the Itinerary
takes the women’s campaign train
through the principal cities of the
north route across the continent and’
brings them back through Colorado,j|
Nebraska, Missouri and Kentucky, aj

Committee are Mrs. Robert Bacon/
whose husband was translated from 1
the House of Morgan to be Roosevelt’s
Assistant Secretary of Stale, and later
Ambassador to France; Mrs. Ber

proprietors of the New York Stunts

ganda against President Wilson; Mrs.

On the Train Fund Committee are

Many of the Junketers who are go
ing along to do the speaking are pro
fessional women, who could not afford
the luxury of special trains nor the
diversion of campaigning without pay.
But back of them, with their money
and the glamour that attaches to their
gilded names, are the women standing
as financial sponsors for this greatest
society show that ever was put on
wheels.
Some of these wives and daughters
of the super-rich will go along on this
mission and with their presence, if
not with their oratory, will warn the
women of the west —who are already
voters —that their country cannot be
"saved" unless the women cast their
vote for the candidate of plutocracy.
The letterhead from Republican
campaign headquarters gives only the
names of the Train Fund Committee
as above, but besides them there Is an
additional committee In charge of this
feature of the Hughes campaign.
Others In on the Junket.
On this committee appear In ad
dition to the foregoing members, the
following:
Mrs. E. T. Stotesbury, whose hus
band Is a Philadelphia partner of J. P.
Morgan & Co.; Mrs. LI. O. Havemeyer,
wife of the Sugar Trust and Standard
Oil magnate; Mrs. Phoebe Hearst,
mother of William Randolph Hearst,
owner of millions In American mines
and Mexican plantations; Mrs. O. H.
P. Belmont, who has undertaken to
raise half a million dollars to defeat
President Wilson; Mrs. John Hays
Hammond, wife of the multimillion
aire mining man; Mrs. Mary Dreler,
New York society leader, of a wealthy
German family with strong antipathy
to President Wilson.
A leading attorney of Pocatello,
Idaho, writing to the Democratic Na
tional Committee, says:
"1 read with deep Interest of the
preparations of the Silk Stocking,
Poodle Dog, Feminine Brigade that Is
soon to start on Its million dollar spe

the enthusiasm of the mothers and
women who carry the burden of our
national greatness on their shoulders,
to vote for their Idol, Hughes.
"It will not he ditlicult for the rank
and tile of the common people to see
Uw hypocrisy of this movement.”
