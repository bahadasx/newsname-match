Death of a Pioneer
George H. Crosby, pioneer,
canal-builder and bishop died at
his home in St. George at one
o'clock last Tuesday. His death
came following a series of sick
spells that have covered the last
nine months ahd were the results
of dropsy accompanied by hearts
failure. The; funeral will be
held in Stt George at the St.
George tabernacle next Sunday
afternoon and memorial services
will be held in Eagar on the same
day.
Mr. Crosby was one of the
strongest leaders in the develop
ment of Apache County. He
moved to this County thirty years
ago last April and two months
after he reached here he was
made Bishop at Springerville by
the union of the Omer and Amity
wards of the Mormon chuch.
He early saw the desirability of
the present townsite of Eagar as
a location for a town and that
town was built under his leader
ship. He was the principal lead
er in the building of the two
canals that now belong to the
Eagar Irrigation system and
after their completion he dis
covered the necessity of reser
voirs and was the leader in con
structing the three that now be
long to that Irrigation company.
The canals and reservoirs that he
planned and was the leader in
building now constitute the best
co-operative irrigation system of
northern Arizona.
Mr. Crosby was celebrated as
a road builder and during'most of
the time that he lived in Apache
County he was superintendent of
roads in the south end of the
county. Up to the time of the
good road movement all of the
better roads of southern Apache
County were the result of his
labor.
In 1895 he was representing
Apache County in the 18th legis
lature. The question of dividing
Apache County came up and Mr.
Crosby gained territorial-wide
reputation by the fervent and
earnestness with which he fought
in opposition to the measure and
became celebrated over all the
territory as the "Gentlemen from
Apache". He actually held the
floor of the legislature and spoke
for seven hours in opposition to
the measure.
Mr. Crosby enjoyed the dis
tinction of having been bishop of
more wards of the Mormon
Church than any other person.
He served as bishop of Hebron,
Utah, of Leeds, Utah, then of
Eagar, Arizona, and finally of
Torrey, Utah. After moving
from Torrey he went to Wyoming
where he resided fourteen years
and he recently returned to his
old home in St. George. Utah, to
spend the last part of his life in
temple labor. He leaves in this
vicinity a family composed of, B.
B. Crosby, the well known rail
road contractor, George H. Cros
by, Jr., Judge of the Superior
Court, Jesse E. Crosby, the Hol
brook Attorney, Mrs. Mema Wilt
bank, wife of William E; Wilt
bank, now candidate for the legis
lature, John A. Crosby of Ramah,
N. M., and Charles W. and
Albert W. Crosby of Eagar, Ari
zona. Bishop Crosby's ability to con
centrate the efforts of a commun
ity in building canals, reservoirs
and roads and in opening landt
and in building homes was phe
nomenal. He is everwhere rec
ognized as a founder of Eagar,
and of its excellent system o:
canals and reservoirs stands ur
as a monument to his leadership
and ability as a developer. Hit
loss is sincerely mourned in Apa
che County.
St. Johns, October 9, 1916.
Editor SfT Johns Herald,
Dear Sir: Will you please pub
lish the following:
To the Peace Officers of Apa
che County.
Gentlemen. The article writ
ten by E. W. Grimes, democrath
nominee for sheriff entitled "Wh.
Is It?" has led many of the vol
ers of the county to ask the sam
question.
It is stated in the article mei
tioned ''th'ere is some agitation as
to whether or not our peace offi
cers believe in jrohibition."
Is there any justification for
the agitation ?
All agree that since the bars'
were thrown down for 'personal
use' it is more difficult to get a
case bu: what about it before
when we all b lieved we had a
good prohibition law. Was there
any more don han now?
Why under the present law are
bootleggers being caught and
punished in other parts of the
state and nothing whatever done
here? Liquoi is certainly plenti-1.
ful enough tnd is being given to
and sold to boy under 16 years
of Ege. Is there an effort being
made to find who the guilty par
ties are? Why are drunken men
allowed to disturb the peace of
our neighborhood. Lo ue citi
zens need to inform the officers
that such is the, case? We pay
more than S6000 per year for the
enforcement of our laws. Do
you not think we have the right
as taxpayers to demand bettei
service than we have had hereto
fore? Gentlemen these are very im
portant questions to the fathers
and mothers of this county before
the coming election. Please let
us hear from you.
Yours truly j
L. N. Gibbons.

How Catarrh is .ontractcd
Mothers are sometimes so
thoughtless as to n ?glect the colds
which their children contract.
The inflammation of the mucus
membrane, at fi st acute, be
anies chronic and the child has
:hronic catarrh, a disease that is
eldom cured and that may prove
a life's burden. Many persons
who have this loathsome disease
will remember having had fre
quent colds at the time it was
contracted. A little forethought
a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy judiciously used, land all
chis trouble might have been
avoided. Obtainable every
where. Adv.
