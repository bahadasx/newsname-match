Pray and Edwards
Enlighten Voters
Large Crowd Hear Republican Speakers
At I. 0. 0. F. Hall Saturday Night
Camping close on the itinerary of
Gov. Sam V. Stewart in his political
tour of the state, Frank J. Edwards,
republican candidate for governor
and Charles N. Pray, republican can
didate for the senate, from Montana,
made their appearance ni Malta,
Saturday evening, after Gov. Stew
art and Harry Mitchell held a demo
cratic meeting.
The large Odd Fellows' hall was
well filled with an appreciative and
attentive audience and from their
remarks it is very evident that the
two gentlement believe in camping
hot on the trails of their opponents.
It is to be regretted that the open
ing address of Charles N. Pray could
not have been heard by every voter
and taxpayer in Phillips county. It
was a powerful argument, backed
up by undisputable facts and deliv
ered in an oritorical and forceful
manner.
Commencing with the initial acts
of the Wilson administration and
following them down to date, he con
vinced his audience that in all ques
tions of national or international
importance the administration's
method of coping with them had been
weak-kneed and vaccilating and
plainly showed evidence of coward
ice, discrimination and favoritism.
He left no doubt in the minds of his
hearers that the Underwood tariff
bill was responsible for the heavy
war tax now imposed and the money
thus derived is being used as a cloak
by the administration forces and a
subsidized democratic press in be
guiling the public into believing that
it is prosperity.
The President's Mexican policy
was vigorously assailed and the high
*cost of living, with prices on the nec
essities of life still soaring, was haln
(died without gloves, a reduction of
the cost of living being one of the
first, yet unfulfilled pledges of the ad
ministration. As a public speaker
Senator Pray attracts by his person
ality, and his dignified bearing and'
ma.:nly way inpresentliung facts.
The people of Montana need an
atdie exponent of their rights and
Iliclds in the senate chambers of the
governlment a lman like Senlator Pray
nld to return him to his seat in that
ibody would show an aplpreciationll oft
his past achievements for the good
i, the state and serve as an incentive
towards further efforts in our behalf.
Senator Pray was followed by thi
next governor of Montana, Frank J.
Edwards, who conclusively proved
the need of a reform in the handling
of the state affairs, especially in mat
ters closely related to the business
management of the capitol building.
Mr. Edwards is a native of Mon
tana and has been a business man at
Helena for the past twenty-five years
and was mayor of that city for a
number of terms, and has always
taken an active part in matters per
taining to the welfare of the state
and it was through his personal ef
forts that a reduction of grain rates
on the Great Northern was made for
shippers for his part of the state.
By electing Mr. Edwards as gov
ernor of Montana, the interests of
all classes will be served and that he

A COWARDLY APPEAL
FOR VOTES.
Mr. Wilson is telling his audiences
that if Mr. Hughes is elected this
country will surely be involved in
war. Is not that a direct appeal to
the cowardice of the American peo
ple. The Eentiment of the men of
this country is that there should nev
er be any war except for two reasons.
One is that the honor of the country
must be maintained, the other is that
the situation must be intolerable be
fore war is justified. Mr. Wilson
sent the fleet to Vera Cruz. He said
it was to vindicate the honor of the
country and its flag, though it was
difficult at the time to comprehend
why the circumstances justified his
position. He refused to even serve
notice on Mexico that unless murder
and looting of American citizens on
the border ceased, he would stop
them.
After that record it must require a
strange order of mind on his part to
imagine if another president were
to take his place there surely would
be war. There has been no danger
of war with any European state since
the war began.
There is liable to be danger when
the war ceases.
Imagine Russia, and Japan in close
alliance, and determined to partition
China between them even as they
have already absorbed Manchura and
Mongolia; there really would be dan
ger. Imagine western Europe and
Great Britain in close alliance, drawn

and factories closed and nlo mer

the war closed, the hordes of Europe
begin to pour in and to enter into

Has Mr. Wilson ever thought of
that? If he ever has he has never
given any sign of it, or what he,
would do were that situation to ma
terialize, though that it is coming is
far more probable. than any foreign I
war.

I)MMUNITY SPIRIT AND
IPERSONAIL OPPOSITION.
(With apologies to George Ade.)
Once upon a time in a small com
munity in the U. S. the growth of the
town and an nufit school building
made necessary the erection of a new
school building. So there was a
special election, the district was
nonded and a new school house was
built out in the corner of the town.
In fact the new building was so far
out in the corner of thehous-e fluit
out that the peoplee who lived in
that vicinity had not got around to
put in walks.
Now there was in this town a city
council, presided over by a mayor.
There was at the time of the election
a newspaper in that town. There was
a school board and a principal of
schools. All of these people saw the
need of a fit walk, but as the school
house was completed in the fall it
was deemed too late to put them in
then.
Another summer came. The school
children had waded, through mud
and snow for six months. Many had
missed school on account of sickness
due to exposure. Everybody expect
ed something would be done. But
when the school opened in the fall
there was still the same old stretch
of mud and water between down
town and school. The attention of
the public was called to the condi
tions through the columns of the
the enwspaper that had been in ex
istance at the time of building the
ed. Again for the sake of children
an appeal was made through the
school notes, which was seconded by
the editor of the before mentioned
paper. This editor lived near the
school house, but having an auto
the missing link in the sidewalk did
not seriously annoy him. He merely
wished ,to call attention to that
which was obviously the duty of the
city dads.
Now in the period between the
bond election and the completion of
the school house, a new editor
breezed into town and began to edit
a paper, and when the first editor
took up the sidewalk question for the
good of the community, the second
editor accused him of using the ham
mer, and airing local affairs around
lhe state. He said that the matter
should he taken up quietly with the
city council, as much as to say, that
these gentlement were ignorant of
the children's needs. Thus, what
was started through public spirit was
r(-ceived and answered as a person

the lecture Sunday evening at the
'old Fellow's hall listened attentive
'v for nearly two hours to Mrs.
.Minona Jones of Chicago, who spoke
on tenpl)rance and against proli-
bition. Whether one is for the wet
or dry side of the question they can
not help hut admire the lady for she
handled the subject in a very force
:able manner and gave the audience
much food for thought. She opened
her address by stating she did not
apologize for being on the side of the
the question she was on, and that
the was an American and thoroughly
americanized, a woman whose an
cestors came to New England in
1835, and that she held true to the
American ideals for which her an
cestors had fought. She said "where
prohibition had been fastened upon a
state it had been a farce and failure
and that according to Hobson the
consumption of liquor had been
steadily on the increase for the past
twenty years. That proof was ample
to show that prohibition does not
prohibit and in her opinion we
should quit passing prohibition laws
and start a temperance crusade, as
temperance means self control and
prohibition means some one else has
control over you."
This was the opening talk for
those who contend the state should
remain in the wet column and will
be followed by others from time to
time.

JE aNNE'iTT, RANKIN
FOR CONGRESS.
Jeannette Rankin, candidate for
congress on the republican ticket, is
making a phenominal campaign all
over the state, and it seems as if
Montana will undoubtedly have the
honor of sending the first woman
representative to Washingtoh.
Wh gver she has appeared on the
platform, large audiences and enthu
siastic applause have attested the
popularity of the woman to whom
woman's suffrage in Montana is
largely due. Miss Rankin was ac
corded one of the largest votes ever
given a candidate on the state ticket
at the recent primaries, and a large
per centage of this came from the
men as well as the women in recog
nition of her great ability.
It is also conceded that she will
receive many democratic and inde
pendent votes, as well as republican,
in view of the well known work she
did for suffrage. Her election is.-gen
erally conceded by all parts of the
state.
If elected to congress, Miss Rankin
will work the farm loan law, equal
taxation, state and national prohi
bition, national woman's suffrage,
and protective laws for children.
She has also done extensive ptudy
ing of the laws of other countries,
and will endeavor to assist in obtain
ing the best possible for the United
States. She has lived in Washing
ton and is thoroughly acquainted
with the workings of congress, and
Montana will make no mistake in
sending so able a representative.
Besides her work for suffrage, she
has studied industrial and social con
ditions in almost every state in the
union; and will be fitted to consider
laws for the amelioration of long
working hours for women, better
quency, educational questions, and
improvement of sanitation laws and
conditions governing children.
Miss Rankin was born in Mon
tana and is a graduate of the Uni
versity of Montan, and of a New
York school.
If Montana sends Miss Rankin as
the first "congress-woman" to Wash
ington, the state will take another I
step forward in the lime light of
progress; and the eyes of the nation
will be turned in approval on an acti
which recognizes ability in its ad
mirble womanhood.

Walter E. Krueger of the Agricul
tural Department of the Great North
ern railway, was entertained by the
Commercial club at a supper given
Monday night. It was planned on
having a luncheon, and plans had
been made for a luncheon, but on ac
count of the train being six hours
late it had to be abandoned and the
supper substituted. Mr. Krueger
spoke very interestingly and con
vincingly on the necessity of diver
sified farming, and strongly urged
the importance of raising alfalfa,
stock and corn, as in that way the
fertility of the farm could be kept
up. He spoke on Tuesday to an in
terested crowd of farmers at the
Phillips County fair, where he urged
the necessity of the county agent if
the farmers were to get the most
from their land.
Phillips County
Fair Big Success
Thousands Attend First Annual Fair At
Dodson This Week
The directors of the First Annual
Phillips County fair were wise in
postponing the days of their big
show until this week, as it has turned
out to be one of the best weeks of
the year and consequently they have
had bigger crowds and more exhibits
The fair at Dodson opened bright
and early Monday morning and the
regular program of the day was car
ried out in full. Malta sent a large
delegation up the first day and many
have gone up every day of the fair,
and they have all been well repaid
for their trouble.
The fair grounds at Dodson are lo
cated a few yards north of the sta
tion on a fine piece of ground which
the fair association has gone to the
expense of improving. A large and
substantial grand stand was erected,
an dthe entire half-mile race track
fenced as was a portion of the out
side enclosure. The room under the
grand stand has been fitted up for
the display of the fancy work and
school exhibits. A part of the room
is partitioned off for a rest room for
the ladies with children.
At the west end of the grounds are
the sheds for the livestock and thei
poultry room. This department was
well taken care of and every stall
contained some fine specimens of
Phillips county stock. Special men
tion should be made of a fine red
polled cow and her twin calves,
which took first prize for this grade
of stock. We did not learn to whom
they belonged but the farmer in Phil
lips county that owns stock of this
calibre should be the proudest far
nmer in the county. Another pretty
attraction down in the east end of
the grounds was mother Angora cat
and her four little kittens. They,
too, i onl a Ilute ibboll . Iick.

stallion.

part of the teachers as well as pu

ribbon for its work at the fair.
Cood nmusic: was furnished all
three days of the fair by tile Dodlsont
band.
Taken as a whole the three days of
the Phillips County fair was well
worth any one's timeto attend, and
the association can feel proud of this
their first annual fair.

receiving to our shores more than

Some of them were bad men, for our
immigration laws are defective, but
the great mass of them were strong
and brave and true, just such men
and women as our race has been
grafting upon its stock for a hun
dred and fifty years. No one doubts
their loyalty to the United States
government; or doubts where they
and their children would stand were
we to be assailed by a foreign power.
And yet those, or many of those who
have come in recent years, and whose
memories still magnify the loveliness
of the institutions they were born
under, and who still have near and
dear relatives in the lands of their
birth, cannot refrain from sympa
thizing with both the people and the
governments of thise lands. Would
we not be the same way if we were
in a foreign country and our native
land was under the Juggernaut of a
great war?
Of course, there are some foolish
and vicious foreign-born people
among us who, in their excitement
over what their native lands are suf
fering, find it convenient to denounce
the United States. But they are in
the aggregate but a pitiable minority
at best, and none of them exceed in
their vindictiveness the American
