Maps Give Heights
Of Oregon Peaks
Bulletin 644, part O, of the United
States Geological Survey, Department
of the Interior, gives descriptions,
latitudes and longitudes of 22 moun
tain peaks or buttes determined by
trlangulation and of 530 points de
termined by primary traverse In Ore
gon in 1913 to 1915 Inclusive.
Each trlangulation station Is per
manently marked by a metal tablet
cemented in solid rock. The true
direction in degrees! minutes and sec
onds and the distances in miles to
other visible trlangulation stations
are given.
The points listed under primary
traverse are mostly road crossings
and township and section corners.
All these positions are utilized by
the Geological Survey as the founda
tion or horizontal control for its to
pographic maps. They may also be
used by local engineers for the same
purpose or as checks on land sur
veys. . The supply of these bulletins is
small, but a copy will he sent post
free to any one who is especially in
terested in such data. Requests for j

"Our George" Tells
All About Things
."Our George," coming direct from
his labors in the oratorical flower
gardens of the nation's capital, spent
an hour and a half Monday evening
at the VIning Theatre in this city,
eipounding the gospel as gleaned at
the feet of Saint Woodrow. Senator
Chamberlain has Had a busy year
keeping track .of one thing and an-
mner arounu abn.ngioa, i.e iuh.
us. but has nevertheless had a,land Frm Um AMOc!atIon wlu be
chance to deduct a few conclusions
regarding the past, present and fu
ture of the United States, and in his
usual impressive and convincing
manner passed on his impressions.
It wouldn't be surprising if George
eent some, who thought they were
republicans, home believing they I
were democrats until they brought
themselves out of it by glancing over
the receipts for the last month's gro
cery and meat bills. George is cer
tainly there when it comes to the
silver-tongued oratory, and the Ash
land appearance being his "coming
out party" in Oregon for this cam
paign, he laid on things thick and
heavy.
George is sure some organist when
it comes to playing on his vocal or
gans. All through the evening while
he ran through the gamut of praise
of Wilson in stentorian tones of im
pressive volume and condemned
Hughes' tactics in the same tones,
little dovelike notes fluted in at in
tervals wtih the echoing refrain, "He
' kept us out of war," the deep ibass
notes boomed forth "Look what Wil
son has done," a plaintive melody
ran through the selection, "Keep the
children from overworking," an oc
casional stray tnote now and then
cautiously slurred over the "eight
hour law," a clattering discord of
Oriental harmonics sought to numb
the senses with "Tariff is no longer
an Issue," and the predominating
theme of the whole evening's concert
was a haunting, elusive, airy, eth
ereal, unsubstantial, dreamy bar
played with the mysterioso stop wide
open and which he styled "The main
issue is the struggle between invis
ible government and the people."
The hearers all left the theatre with
the feeling that they had heard an
old familiar tune but not able to
whistle it themselves out loud. Per
haps you know the depressing feel
ing which is left by the weird music
of a great symphony. A kind ' of
dreamy, half exalted sense of unreal-
, ness. The senator's organ music left
just this feeling. Most everybody
had slept it off by morning.
The two big points which Senator
Chamberlain sought to make were,
"Tariff is not an issue" and "The
Issue is the struggle against the in
visible government." The tariff fea
ture was believed by the democrats
present, no doubt, or most of them
at least, and understood by. the re
publicans. The Invisible government
cast its shadow over all as most
things which are invisible and in
tangible do. , .
The theatre was filled, all hut
about seventy-five chairs which were
placed on the stage. Everyone ar
riving late was invited to take one
of the stage chairs, but apparently
either none of the democrats had the ,

Rev. Farquhar Will
Leave November 1
Rev. R. W. Farquhar of the Ash
land Congregational church has
handed in his resignation, to take
effect on November 1. Rev. Farqu
har will go to Portland, where he has
work outlined. During his pastorate
the Congregational church has made
progress !n many ways. Mr. Farqu-
har has won a host of friends who
will regret seeing him leave. During
the past six months under Rev. Far-
quhar's guidance the church has
gained the pledge of fl.000 to pay
off a debt, most of It having been
paid. Mrs. R. D. Mills left the sum
of $500, which will be used for new
pews and carpet, and Mrs. Ella Mills
will have a memorial window in

church is making an effort to get a
pastor here to succeed Rev. Farquhar
so that the new man can take up the

Cheese Below Cost
To Make Ad Good
In Monday's issue of the Tidings,
an error in the ad of the White
House Grocery slipped through, and
Klamath cheese was advertised at 10
cents a pound as an extra special.
This should have read 20 cents a
pound which is pretty close to what
the cheese cost. In order that cus
tomers of the grocery and readers
of Tidings' advertisements might not
be disappointed the White House has
sold the cheese at the price adver
tised until the correction could be
made today, and the grocery and the
Tidings have borne the loss.

Mrs. Rccho, vice-president of the

As a prelude to the organ solo,
Mr. Lacey played a piano solo which
was greatly appreciated by the crowd
and Miss Bess Bryan, a relative of
William Jennings himself and the
possessor of a very sweet voice, sang
and won the hearts of the audience.
The crowd, republican, democratic
and socialist alike, all arose and for

Says Tombstone
Trust Is Squirming
The Portland tombstone trust,
which has been running things with
a high hind in the Oregon metropo
lis for the past several years, is
squirming under the heavy hand of
the law at last, ' according to Mr.
Blair of the Blair Granite company.
Some two weeks ago suit was
brought against a combination of
Portland granite men by a represen
tative of the Blair company under
the Portland anti-trust ordinance.
The complaint charges the six or
seven firms implicated with combin
ation for the purpose of keeping out
outside firms and keeping the prices
up. Results re expected In the near
future, according to Mr. Blair, and
at any rate the Portlanders will have
had enough of a scare thrown Into
them to preclude any further tactics
such as they have practised in the
past. !
The combination was originally
formed to establish prices according
to the loca', men, but the Portland
ers have used It to keep the local
granite out of the market. The
method of procedure employed, ac
cording to Mr. Blair, Is combined
knocking of the-Ashland product.
First they, told all prosepctlve pur
chasers of granite that the Ashland
granite was full of knots and streaks.
The Blair people exploded this by
exhibiting specimen after specimen,
freer from streaks and knots than
anything the other firms could show.
Then the tombstone peddlers told
everybody that the Ashland granite
had iron in It and would rust. This
charge Is hard to met, according to
Mr. Blair, since rust does not show
up for a year or so but the granite
which has been out for a year or
several years, which was taken out
by the Blairs or other quarrymen
from their quarry, has never shown
signs of rust.,
The combined effort of several
dealers, standing up for each other
and knocking the Ashland granite
has had its effect, however, and the
Blairs are fighting now to put a stop
to such unfair business methods.

Railraad Wants
High Demurrage
Claiming that car efficiency can be
obtained and the present stringent
shortage relieved only by fixing a
demurrage rate which makes it an
incentive and benefit to the general
shipping public to release cars with
the greatest possible despatch, the
Southern Pacific Company, by Its at
torney, Ben C. Dey, Thursday filed a
statement with the Public Service
Commission.
The report recommends the abro
gation of the average agreement
rules and the adoption of the straight
rules and the cancellation of the 24
hours' free time allowed to minor
railroads for switching. It Is af
firmed that the $3 demurrage rate
In California has brought about
greater car efficiency than is effect
ive In any other territory touched by
the Southern Pacific. The plan is
recommended especially for Oregon,
where it Is claimed that because of
the low rates and "average" agree
ment five times as many cars are
held In excess of the free time limit
as are held in California.
The Oregon state demurrage rate
is $2 and its interstate rate is $1.
It Is cited in the report that the Ore
gon law provides for a maximum rate
of $4 which will allow the operation
of the proposed $3 rate.
Frank J. Miller, chairman of the
commission, recently publicly stated
that the railroad company had pre
sented a petition asking permission
to apply the $3 rate In Oregon, but
the commission had refused, claim
ing that the $2 rate is one fair alike
io railroad and to shipper.
The report of the railroad is in
tended to show that the California
shippers release their cars better and
more promptly than do the Oregon
shippers, and the effect of the report
Is intended to cause the Oregon com
mission to change its ruling.
Commissioner Miller takes the
fview that the railroads should first
establish a demurrage rate on ship
ments intended for' trans-oceanic des
tinations instead of allowing the cars
to stand indefinitely awaiting reload
ing of the goods onto ships. - - -

Rogue Fishermen
Have Big Season
Rogue river, which for the 35
years since commercial fishing was
opened there by R. D. Hume has nev
er failed to give forth an abundance
of salmon, outstripped all previous
records 'his year. The catch amount
ed to practically 60,000 cases, and
the flllverslde run is yet to be packed.
If the pack were sold at 10 cents a
can the wealth of Rogue river, In
cluding Hie vicinity Immediately ad-
Jacent to the mouth, would be in-,
creased $288,000.
The fine run of fish made every
body prosperous in the Gold Beach
and Wedderburn neighborhoods. The
fishermen received high prices, the
boats which transported the supplies
to the canneries made big money and
the packers will have handsome prof
Its. Fishermen and observers of condi
tions account for .the heavy receipts
of 1916 through the foresight of R.
L. Macleay, manager of the estate,
who several years ago adopted the
custom of feeding the fry until they
were much larger than salmon that
were released in former years. It Is
now the custom to feed salmon until
they are three and four inches in
length, and 1,500,000 of this size
were released this season from the
hatchery near the mouth of the
Rogue. Oregonlan. '

fifty carloads of prunes.
Chandler Rides
Nero 20 Seconds
A large number from here went
over to the Rodeo at Yreka last Sun
day and the Pacific highway was
alive all morning with cars from the
valley. The seating capacity at the
lmprovlsod round-up grounds In the
Yreka ball park was taxed and a
good natured crowd rooted for In
dians, wht.es and negros allKe In the
various wild west eventi.
Jenks Murphy of Ashland took the
relay for the third consecutive day
without trouble, riding against Spears
with a Klamath strings.
The feature of the day was the
ride of Love Chandler of Klamath
Falls on Nero, the bucking bull.
Chandler rode the plunging beast for
20 seconds, straight up, and then
appeared to dismount rather than
be thrown. It was as pretty an ex
hibition of riding as was seen at the
Ashland Hound-up, and evoked great
applause.
Chandler and George Fletcher had
It neck and neck for the high honors
in bucking, but the Klamath rider
finally won out over the Pendleton
negro.
Managers of the local round-up-hope
to get Chandler to come to Ash
land next summer.
Clark Shows Up
Chamberlain's Talk
A. E. Clark of Portland In a force
ful address before a crowd which
overflowed the Lyric Theatre, ripped
Senator Chamberlain's address to
pieces, a point at a time, in a con
cise, clear statement of virile facts.
And not only did he tear down the
edifice which "our George" had
erected, but on a firm foundation of
facts and figures a new foundation
was built for republican success in
Ashland.
The Lyric Theatre proved far too
small and scores were obliged to
stand or be turned away last night-
George Andrews of liieutord opened
the evening's program with a solo,
"Baibara Frletchle," which was en
thusiastically applauded and encored.
C. I). Lamkin of Ashland, who acted
as chairman, then Introduced Fred
Mears of Medford, who spoke briefly.
Mr. Lamkin Introduced Mr. Mears
with the statement, "Mears and
Cummins took 'own out of the hands
of special privilege and kept it out."
Mr. Mears eulogized Senator La-
; Follette and quoted him as saying
'after the nomination of Governor
Hughes that "Charles E. Hughes will
be acceptable to the great body of
republican voters, his ability, person-
i States.
Mrs. Perozzl followed Mr. Mears '
en's Special which will he here next
Sunday at 4:15, and outlined the ac
complishments of some of the women
workers who will be on this train.
Mr. Clark was then introduced
and opened his speech with the state
ment: "The greatest issues of the
last one-half century, both national
and International, are now confront
ing the United States. These prob
lems spring out of the futile diplo
macy and statesmanship of the demo
cratic party."
lie then launched Into a review of
Governor Hughes' record of accom
plishment in New York state, show
ing the constructive legislation en
acted during his governorship. Ha
stated that the great democratic
dallies, including a certain great
Portland paper, lauded Charles E.
Hughes before the election as a man
too big for the republican party to
nominate, and have since discovered
"sinister motives." He compared
Hughes' and Wilson's utterances at
the time Hughes was active in polltl-
cnl work In New York
He then took up the points upon
which Chamberlain dwelt and by au
thentic figures, quotations and re
ports from democratic sources pinned
each point down and hammered it
with fact after fact until it was
shown up as erroneous or had disap
peared altogether.
Mr. Clark closed with an eloquent
plea for the election of Mr. Hughes
and a republican congress to carry
Into effect policies having for their
object the protection of American
labor and American industry, and
the upbuilding . of a prosperity of
peace, not a prosperity that must
have a world war to sustain it.
