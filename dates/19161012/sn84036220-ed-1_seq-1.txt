NEW YORK, Oct. 11.—The Boston
Americans drew one notch nearer to
the world's championship here this
afternoon when they defeated the
Brooklyn Nationals, 6 to 2, in the
fourth game of the series, which now
stands 3 to 1 in the Red Sox's favor.
Tomorrow the conflict will be renewed
at Braves' Field, Boston, where the
fifth, and, what the Red Sox hope,
will be the deciding game, will be
played. Tomorrow is a legal holiday
in Massachusetts and the indications
point to an enormous attendance.
With today's contest at Ebbet's
Field, the players ceased to partici
pate in the financial returns and the
Boston men, with their lead, are eager
to close the season and receive their
reward.
The manner In which Boston tore
into the Brooklyn team this afternoon
left no doubt as to their intention of
ending the series as quickly as pos
sible. Pitcher "Dutch" Leonard spot
ted the Nationals two runs in the open
ing inning, but his teammates more
than made up the handicap in the sec
ond session and once in the van re
fused to permit the Superbas to creep
upon them.
The contest, although featured by
several sensational plays, did not rise
much above the average of a regular
season contest. Once Leonard swung
into form the Brooklyn batters found
it impossible to push a runner around
to the plate. Long, slashing hits
ripped off the bats of the Red Sox
to be charged against the account of
Brooklyn pitchers, with splendid
catches, stops and throws, made the
way easy for Leonard.
The Brooklyn club gave its support
ers great hopes of repeating the vic
tory of Tuesday when two runs were
put over in the first inning on Johns
ton's triple, Myers' single, a base on
balls and an error by Janvrin, who,
in his eagerness to get Myers at the
plate, fumbled Cutshaw's grounder.
Rube Marquard, Manager Robinson's
selection for a second try against the
Boston batters, staved off the Red Sox
in the initial inning but Gardner took
much of the mystery out of his deliv
ery when he hammered out a home
run, his second in two days, with two
on bases, in the succeeding session.
Marquard walked Hoblitzell. the first
man up, and Lewis advanced his to
third with a double to the right field
wall. Gardner then cleaned up with
his homer, a drive to deep center.
The Red Sox added another tally in
the fourth when Lewis singled, went
to second on Gardner's sacrifice and
scored on Manager Carrigan's single.
Another was added in the fifth when
Cheney, who replaced Marquard in
the box after Pfeffer had batted for
the former, passed Hooper, who stole

WHEN NEEDED IN WAR
President Issues Statement Describ
ing the Council's Chief Functions,
and Adds That the Time of Some of
the Members of the Advisory Board
Could Not Be Purchased; That
They Serve the Government With
out Remuneration, Efficiency Being
Their Sole Object and Americanism
Their Only Motive.
ON BOARD PRESIDENT WIL
SON'S SPECIAL; HARRISBURG, Pa.,
Oct. 11.—President Wilson, en route
to Indianapolis tonight, announced
the appointment of members of the
advisory commission to be associated
with the council of national defense,
created by congress at the last ses
sion. At the same time he gave out
a statement saying he hoped the coun
cil will "become a rallying point for
civic bodies working for the national
defense."
The seven members of the now
advisory commission named by the
president tonight are:
Daniel Willard, presidenUof the Bal
timore & Ohio railroad: r ' -i Oompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor; Dr. Franklin H. Martin, of
Chicago; Howard E. Coffin of De
troit; Bernard Baruch of New York;
Dr. Hollis Godfrey of Philadelphia and
Julius ltosenwald of Chicago.
The president's statement follows:
"The council of national defense has
been created because the congress has
realized that the country is best pre
pared for war when thoroughly at
peace. From an economic point of
view, there is now very little differ
ence between the machinery re
quired for commercial efficiency and
that required for military purposes.
In both cases the whole industrial
mechanism must be organized in the
most effective way. Upon this con
ception of the national welfare the
council is organized In the words of
the act for "the creation of relations
which will render possible in time
of need the immediate concentration
and utilization of the resources of
the nation. The organization of coun
cil likewise opens up a new and direct
channel of communication and co-op
eration between business and scien
tific men and all departments of the
government, and it is hoped that it
will, in addition, become a rallying
point for civic bodies working for the
national defense.
"The council's chief functions are:
"1—The co-ordination of all forms
cti transportation and the develop
ment of means of transportation to
meet the military, industrial and com
mercial needs of the nation.
"2—The extension of the industrial
mobilization work of the committee on
industrial preparedness of the naval
consulting board. Complete informa
tion as to our present manufacturing
and producing facilities adaptable to
many-sided issues of modern warfare
will be procured, analyzed and made
use of.
"One of the abjects of the council
will be to inform American manu
facturers as to the part which they
can and must play in national emer
gency. It is empowered to establish
at once and maintain through subor
dinate bodies of specially qualified
persons an auxiliary organization com
posed of men of the best creative and
administrative capacity, capable of
mobilizing to the utmost the resources
of the country.
"The personnel of the council's ad
visory members, appointed without
regard to party, marks the entrance
of the non-partisan engineer and pro
fessional man into American govern
mental affairs on a wider scale than
ever before. It is responsive to the
increased demand for and need of
business organization in public mut
ters and for the presence there of
the best specialists in their respec
tive fields. In the present instance,
the time of some of the members of
the advisory board could not be pur
chased. They serve the government
without remuneration, efficiency being
their sole object and Americanism
their only motive."
'o make several short stops In In
liana and Ohio but he reiterated to
night his determination not to make
my campaign speeches from the rear
platform of his private car. At Day
ton, Ohio, and Richmond, Indiana,
tomorrow morning, however, he is
expected to shake hands with crowds.
The president was applauded when
he appeared on the observation plat
form of his car at Philadelphia, this
afternoon. He remained on the plat
form fifteen minutes shaking hands
with men and women. The cheering
was renewed as the train pulled out.

EXPERT RIDER
MEETS DEATH
MRS. FLORENCE MEADOWS, NEE
BARBEE, THROWN FROM HER
HORSE NEAR HER HOME.
FUNERAL HELD M. E. CHURCH
Mrs. Florence Meadows, wife of A1
leu Meadows, a bride of six weeks was
found dead by the side of the road
near the Harding ranch about three
miles from her home on the old Cam
eron place, thirty-five miles northeast
of Lewistown. In her hands were
clasped the bridle reins and her fa
vorite saddle horse was grazing in
the lane a short distance away.
Dr. Fauls who was returning to
Roy about 4 o'clock Saturday after
noon after responding to a call to j
the Harding ranch to set the leg of
a man who had been injured during
the morning suddenly came upon the
body of Mrs. Meadows by the side
of the road. Every possible means
of resuscitation was resorted to hut
in spite the fact life had been extinct
but a short time the effort was of no
avail. The doctor and the man accom
panying him then placed the body in
their conveyance and returned to the
Harding ranch where identification
was established. They then took the
body to Roy, notifying Justice of the
Peace Clow immediately upon their
arrival there. Justice Clow tele
phoned to Coroner Creel noti
fying him of the accident who in
turn communicated with Gilt Edge in '
an effort to apprise the husband who
was supposed to be there of the acci
dent.
Mrs. Meadows, who was prior to her
marriage Florence Barbee, was a
daughter of George Barbee and Mrs.
Kate Barbee, and was born in the
state of Washington about 22 years
ago. She had lived with her parents
for the past twelve years and during
that time had achieved a reputation
as a wonderfully clever horsewoman.
Her horsewonianship had attracted
wide attention and on various occa
sions efforts had been made to per
suade her to ride in competitive con
tests in this country and in Canada.
She is survived by her father and
mother, one sister, I.oa Barbee, who
conducts the Diamond rooming house
of this city, and three brothers, Dan
Martin and William Barbee.
The funeral of the late Florence
Barbee Meadows of Fort Maginnis,
whose death resulted from an acci
dent last Saturday afternoon, was held
from the Methodist church in this city
Tuesday afternoon. There was a
large attendance of sorrowing relatives
and friends, the auditorium being well
filled. Rev. C. M. Donaldson, who con
ducted the services, delivered a con
soling address, in which lie paid a
high tribute to the many virtues of
the decedent. The choir sang three
beautiful selections. There were nu
merous floral tributes.
Singular Incident.
A remarkable incident connected
with the sad and tragic death of the
popular young woman is related. The
road was wet and slippery and the
horse, as revealed by the marks in the
wet snow, had slipped. In recovering
it is supposed that tho animal's quick
movement threw the rider, who alight
ed on her bead. Her neck was broken
and the fall caused concussion of the
brain. She never moved after striking
the ground and the reinB were still
held in her nerveless hand when nrs.

SWINDLEHURST AND EVANS AD
DRESS BIG GATHERING AT
ARMORY HALL.
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE DEMOCRATS
One of the most attentive and appre
ciative audiences which has attended
any political meeting during the pres
ent campaign greeted Congressman
John M. Evans and Thomas M.
Swindlehurst in the Armory hall last
evening. Senator J. E. I-ane acted as
chairman of the meeting and in a very
few well chosen words introduced Mr.
Swindlehurst, the first speaker of the
evening, whose address was a very
brief, logical argument in support of
the democratic party, nationally, and
in the state and county. His review
of the accomplishments of the nation
al and state administrations brought
forth round after round of applause,
and his advocacy of the establishment
of a farm loan hank In Montana in
stead of St. Paul particularly pleased
his audience. A plea for the loyal
support of Governor Stewart was
made by Mr. Swindlehurst, as he laid
particular emphasis on his devotion
to the state and his upbuilding of its
institutions. In closing he asked the
support of ills audience not because
the men on the democratic ticket were
democrats but because they represent
ed democratic policies and democratic
principles.
Congressman Evans, the next speak
er, carried the audience with him. He,
too, was interrupted time and again
by applause. Mr. Evans spoke earnest
ly and delivered his address in a mas
terly manner.
Mr. Evans' Address.
Mr. Fivans spoke in part as fol
lows:
'The first great piece of legislation
undertaken was a revision of the tar
riff. The motive actuating the demo
cratic party in revising the tariff was
that of the public good. Republican
revisions, as a rule, considered the
welfare of the protected interests ns
paramount and the interests of the
people as a mere incident. The demo
crats put the people above every other
consideration and presented the coun
try witli a tariff for revenue. Prom
ises were redeemed (l)gby an enlarged
free list (2), by lower duties on other
goods and (3), by an income tax.
Income Tax.
"in connection witli the Underwood
tariff acts this administration passed
and put into effect an income lax law.
Under the operation of this statute
the wealthy and well to do pay into
the treasury every year two hundred
million dollars in taxes on their enor
mous incomes, which formerly went
scot free. Under republican rule, this
gigantic sum was raised by means
of a tariff on food and clothing, which
were largely consumed by the plain
people. Under democratic law, this
burden lias been shifted from tho
poor man's bending to the broad shoul
ders of those whose net incomes are
in excess of $:'.,0o0 a year. What law
could be more popular than this?
What measure could be more just?
What statute could more effectually
lighten tile load of those who strug
gie for their daily bread? Will any
republican candidate for office ad
vocate a repeal of this law?
