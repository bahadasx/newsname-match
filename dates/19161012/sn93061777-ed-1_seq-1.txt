A Great Loss
Mr. John I -nra-l ;i t.'iv manu
facturer oi blooms is in Clovis.
atid when intt:vviwed by :i News
man sio: ''Brcom corn is ngood
.a:'- p-. -htable crop hen'. But
'.he tanners are lo-ing moiity
every eur by not taking care of
it, Why, one rain may damage
broom corn from qU'i to $15 per
ton. Sheds should be built to
put. the corn in. These sheds
are inexpensive and the increase
in the price of the corn will
soon pay for them. The people
in Oklahoma. Illinois, and some
other states get better prices for
their corn than the growers in
Eastern New Mexico, because
they take better care of it. If
you could get the broom corn
growers of this section to take
hprtr care of their product it
would put hundreds of dollars
in their pockets annually."
Mrs. Ua.'ina Roach has moved
to Clovis from her ranch home

Bert Curless, Secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce is visit

Wants More Land. He Was all Smiles
Prof. J. F. Smith, of the Ho! E. H. ila'.vs m, who owns 320
lene neighborhood, was in Clo-: acres of choice land northwest
vis Fridav. When ae-osted bviof Clovis, was in the city with a
a Nkws reporter, h- said
among other things: "I have
lived here two years This is a
great countiy 1 want to buy
more land."
Guess that's sullicient evi
dence of Prof. Smith's belief
in the future possibilities of
Curry county land.

There are no idle people, every i there were one hundred houses
body who wants work can getlbuiltin the city, and most of
it, and there seems to be pienty
of work for all.
The country surrounding
Clovis is not appreciated by
home people as it should be.
Business is so good that we are
apt to forget there ever were
any hard times in this country.
Never in the history of this city
have general conditions been
as good as they are today.
Every one who knows anything
about it, all the old timers say
the future of Clovis and East -

The big rains of August ind
epieniner seemea to put trie
finishing touches on one of the
best year? this country has ev
er seen. The season started
out with a half million bushels
of wheat in the county, and
ends with one of the best crops
of maize, koffir, feterita, and
other row crops ever raised in
these parts. There will be all
kinds of feed for the winter,
the range is in excellent con
dition and cattle are in fine
shape.
The wheat acreage is more
than double that of last year,
and there are bright prospects
for a million buahei crop next
year. At present prices this
J means a million and a half dol

Thn railroad shops of Clovis
are running 'u!i Must, the
$7-,0OU monthly payroll of the
Santa Fe is the largest in
dustrial interprise we have.
Clovis is glad to he the home
of its r00 railroad men. They
are the very back-bone of the
city and ive could not get along
very well without them. Clovis
is not only a commercial center
for a large, rich agricultural and
stock raising section, but it has
the full-dinner paid brigade
which makes it a much better
town than those depending
solely upon its agricultural re
sources.
Clovis ha a large number of
big mercantile establishments
which are doing a big business.
The stocks carried are large, the
assortment is great, and the
merchandise is as up-to-date as
any city of 100,000 people. Its
merchants make regular pil
grimages to the big markets
of the East and North and get
everything the market affords
for the people of this section.
The banks of Clovis are in a
flourishing condition. Half a
million dollars are on deposit
in the three banks. Clovis is
these were nice homes of the
bungalow type. At the present
time there are ten or a dozen
houses going up in different
parts of the city. One of the
nicest homes being erected is
that of John Barry, the well
known hardware merchant. It
is being built of brick and has a
Southeast exposure. It is locat
ed at the Comer of Axtf.ll and
Vigil streets.

Same Over Here.
Joe Roherts, wh - ,s domi
ciled on a good piece jf land
some five miles southeast of the
city, said to the News m.in one
day recently: "I have only
been here about seven months,
but I like this country better
than any place I ever saw. I
was in Oklahoma tiv years,
going from Texas to that state.
In my opinion this country has
those states bested. "
Mr. Roberta is backing up
his faith by his works, by get
ting hold of a goodly sized
chunk of Curry county land. It
is just the same story on the
part of all. or practically all who
come to tnis great, growing
country. They all fail head
over heels in love with it in
stanter. How could it possibly
by otherwise?
Geo. Roach is in Santa Fe on
legal business.
