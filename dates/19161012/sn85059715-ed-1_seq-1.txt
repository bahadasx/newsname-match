SEES THE GAME
Last Trench Fight is Prepared
by the Brooklyn Team
against Boston.
BIG FINANCIAL" REWARDS
Only One Game Lays between
. Boston and Another World's
Championship.
(?V ??OClATtO *???>
BOSTON, Oct. 12.?The anniver
sary of the discovery of America by
Columbus observed as a holiday here
coincided with the fifth gnrne of the
world's series between the Brooklyn
Nationals and the Boston Americans.
Thousands of persons freed from
their labor by the holiday toolc ad
vantage of the opportunity to go to
Braves fleld. The result was likely
to be the greatest crowd In the his
tory of baseball. Braves field, al
though holding the record for attend
ance of 42,300 In the series last year,
has not yet been taxed to capacity.
It was a last trench fight which the
lirooklvns prepared to make against
the Hod Sox. Three of the four games
already played have gone against
them by force of the Boston batsmen's
strength or the tureuess of Red Sox
pitchers. Only one game lies be
tween the Boston team and another
world's championship.
Financial rewards this year exceed
' hose of any previous series. The Hed
Sox, feeling certain of final success in
today's game, contemplated with sat-:
isfactlon their share In the $162.
927.45 which Is the players' portion
of the receipts of the first four games
after which their participation In the
gale money ends. Of this amount,
sixty per cent or $37,756 will be
turned over to the winners. Should
this go to the Bostons the will divide
it probably on a twenty-five shnre
basis, allowing $3,910.25 a Bhare. Al
though twenty-six lied Sox playersj
,are eligible to play In the series, not1
all will receive full shares and It Is
understood the players have agreed
on the division by twenty-fifths with
file idea bf splitting up several shares
among lesser members of the club,
minor officials and employes. Brook
lyn. if It loses, will have $65,169.!)S
to divide among twenty-three players
or about $2,844.47 a man.

Young Town Democrats Try to

"That was an outrage." said a prom-!
Inent Bridgeport Democrat after thej
Com we 11 meeting here Wednesday
utBtit, as he stood in a group that had
galhcrcd on the outside of the court
house.
A reporter asked him what he
meant. He replied: "Why that hunch

purposely In the front door of the
c-'Hirthousc to keep the crowd hack so
that the public would be deceived into
believing that the house was so taxed
that an overflow meeting was neces
sary."
And that Bridgeport Democrat was
not I he only countryman hot under
the collar, cither.
One prominent local Democrat
Thursday morning in boasting about
the size of the crowd said:
"Why the room was half full before
the speaking began."
The Exponent said the crowd began
to gather at C o'clock in the court
house. The janitor was there.
That parade was a joke. Hoy Scouts
figured lu It but tbey didn't have their
uniforms on.
Thursday morning's aftermath of
the meeting reminded casual ob
servers of that old Democratic cry of
"free liquor". A well known young
man about town suspected of being
an active bootlegger visited the can
didate's room at the hotel and there
were two or three dozen "dry" Demo
crats on hand. The way they smacked
their lips when they left the room
indicated that they bad had some

Cornwell left town after this recep

WOMEN'S SPECIAL
IS GREAT SUCCESS
Declares Miss Frances Kellor,
an Enthusiastic Hughes
Alliance Leader.
? ?PKCIAL TO THI TKLISHAMI
NEW YORK, October 12.?
"The women's campaign special
train In proving a great success," said
Miss Frances A. Kellor at the Hughes
alliance headquarters today. Miss
Kellor who Is chairman of the wom
en's committee of the national
Hughes alliance has had charge ot the
entire work of financing and equip
ping the train and of organizing both
the speakers that go with the train
and the state and local committees
that receive It. Miss Kellor was
obliged to leave the train at Minneap
olis Saturday night for a business
trip to New York but will rejoin It at
once.
"The thing that pleases us most
Is the activity of the Democratic na
tional committee" Miss Kellor said.
"They have organized from the At
lantic to the Pacific to defeat the
train. The honor of drawing the
full batteries of the opposition has
remained for the women. The stor
ies sent out about the wealth and
luxury represented by the train were
enough to make every bandit left In
the West hurry down to the railroad
track to stop us.
"These Btorles are beginning to do
us good. In several places where peo
ple have come to meet the train ex
pecting to find all sorts of curiosi
ties they have been all the more Im
pressed by the serious, earnest, com
petent women that they really did
find there instead ot getting Into an
atmosphere ot diamonds and ladles'
maids and manicures, tbey found
themselves In a pompany of intelli
gent, thoroughly Informed, practical
women with keen, broad social con
clousness. I see In the morning
papers that the Democratic women
expect to have the use of 100,000 au
tomobiles for a month. I wonder
why It Is virtuous to have 100,000
autos and wicked to have a special
train. Even If all the cars are Fords
they would represent an Investment
of at least >40,000,000, which makes
the headlight of our special train
seem pale and dim. If a woman Is
a plutocrat because she can sub
scribe toward the specfal and our
subscriptions' ran from |1 up why
Isn't she a plutocrat if she has a car
to lend for a month. I wonder how
expensive a car you can have and
still be a Democrat In good and reg
ular standing. The interest that our
train is arousing through the West
shows what people before really think
of it. We expected to handle three
crowds a day. We are now handling
eight No one else Is meeting as
many groups except the candidate
himself.
"The most regrettable aspects of
the attack on the train Is the per
sonal tone that has Intentionally been
given to them. The Republican wom
en throughout this campaign havo|
played straight clean politics, with
out descending to personalities in any
single case and there are personali
ties that could be used In this cam
paign too. It will be found, however,
that the general feeling among Amer
ican women demands that a high tone
mark their national participation in
political life."
COLUMBUS -DAY
PONTIUS PILATE
ACT OF WILSON
Comes in for Characteristic
Notice of Roosevelt Who
Says Wilson is Coward.
(?PgCIAL TO TMK TKLIOMAM)
NEW YORK, Oct .12.?Taking the
German submarine U-53 off the
shores of America as his text Col.
Roosevelt has launched another
broadside against President Wilson.
Mr. Roosevelt declared that the con
duct of the war has led to a "com
plete breakdown of the code of in
ternational rights." and this he;
blames on the "Poneius Pilate like'
construction which President Wilson;
has put on neutrality." The sentence
"He kept us out of war", which isi
one of the chlet arguments of the
Democratic campaign Colonel Roose
velt described as "the pbrase of a
coward," and utterly misleading.
"President Wilson declared that
the war and the issues of right and
wrong Involved In Its conduct and
methots were of no concern to
America, the leading neutral," says
Colonel Roosevelt. "He thereby put
America in the position of refusing
of doing its duty to others. He in
spired contempt In others. This In
vited aggression by others. In the
face of this aggression he speedily
put America in a position of refus
ing to do its duty to Its own citi
zens. Step by step international law
has been broken down. By the at
tacks of German submarines upon
merchantmen the lives of hundreds
of Americans were sacrificed in a
course which culminated In the sink
ing of the Lusitanla. In a similar
fashion the commercial rights of
property upon the sea were invaded
by England and the whole structure
of international law for the protec
tion of commerce and private prop
erty was broken down. The invasion
of thd*rfghts of men and women to
their lives was far more serious than
the invasion of property rights and
it was this Invasion that called for
the first and strongest action on our
part, but If we had taken such as
tlon it would have become our duty,
a duty the neaslly performer, to In
stantly and fully protect our prop
erty rights. Many men question
whether It will ever again be safe for
nations to become Interdependent by
allowing themselves so far as their
necessaries are concerned to depend
upon foreign sources of supply. The
theory of having each nation or group
of nations build a Chinese wall
around Its borders Is being discussed
because of the complete breakdown of
the code of international rights.
"The responsibility for this break
down rests primarily on the Pontius
Pilate like construction which Presi
dent Wilson has put upon neutrality.
Now the war has been carried to our
very shores. There Is no American
who does not realize the awful tragedy
of our Indifference and inaction. Nine
tenths ot wisdom Is being wise In time.
By taking the right step at the right
time America's Influence and leader

HAPGOOD STORY IS
DENIED BY RIDDER
German Editor Gives the Lie to
That Tale about Writing
a Speech.
NEW York!" Oc't* 12-.?in"a Signed
statement today .Mr. Victor Rtdder, of
the New York Stoats Zeltung, denies
absolutely the story made public by
Norman Hapgood, of the Wilson Inde
pendent League, to the effect that Mr.
Rldder has told State Senator Keller
of Illinois that he bad written a cam
paign speech for Mr. Hughes In which
Mr. Hughes would attack England In
order to hold tho German vote. Mr.
Rldder says thoro was a meeting be
tween himself and Senator Keller. By
knowing Mr. Keller he had witnesses
present and he has the written state
ment of one of these witnesses, Henry
Abies, of New York, that no such re
marks as are credited to him by Keller
and Hnpgood were even made. In.
stead Keller was endeavoring to per
suade Mr. Rldder to call on President
Wilson at the White House, and as
sured Mr. Rldder that Mr. Wilson "can
convince you, in tho course of an hour
or two. that be Is friendly to Ger
many."
Mr. Rldder declared that Mr. Keller
"for bis own purposes wilfully placed
words In my mouth which were never
spoken." Having disposed of this can
ard Mr. Kidder goes on to make some
extremely interesting disclosures con
cerning the efforts of the Wilson ad
ministration to curry favor secretly
with the German American inters
whom-Mr. Wilson publicly brands as
disloyal. He says that Mr. Abies hap
pened to be present at the meeting
with Mr. Kflllnr. bavins called as the
bearer of an Invitation from Senator
Stone, chairman of the foreign rela
tions committee of the Senate, to dis
cuss the questions of the campaign at
a gathering of Influential German
Americans to bo arranged at Tcrraco
Garden that very evening. I declined
the Invitation. Mr. Abies immediately
called up Senator Stone from the
Staats Zeltung office and told him that
1 had declined. Senator Stone them
spoke to me, Baying that he would
regard It as a personal favor not only
to come myself but also to bring In
fluential German Americans with me.
Under the circumstances I feel
that we should at least hear what
Senator Stone had to say and so a
number of us gathered at Terrace
Garden tor dinner at 8 o'clock on
September 16 as the guests of Mr.
Abeles. Senator Stone used all his
well known powers of persuasion and
I am ready to concede him the palm
as an able advocate of the admin
istration to convince us that the ap
parent anti-German American poli
cies of the Wilson administration
were only for public consumption,
and that privately they were ready to
work hand In glove with the German
American leaders. The whole object
of this conference so far as Senator
Stone was concerned was to find out
what action was necessary on the
part of the administration in order
to secure the support of German
Americans at the coming ? election.
Can anything be more humiliating
than the spectable of the chairman
of the foreign relations committee
of the Senate gumshoeing in a small
