CORRESPONDENCE

Late picnics are better than late
watermelons, though we are fond of
both.
Some of the farmers in this section
haven't picked out a hale of cotton
yet, owing to the fact that it just
hasn't opened, while others are about
done^gathering their cotton crops.
Pea crops are very sorry through
this section, owing to the fact that
many were gathered green.
Our new school house at White
Oak is a dandy and our school will
start Monday, October 23. But there

to our good school house.

One good friend of The Advertiser
on Route No. 2, Patrick sent in a
nice letter two weeks ago, but missed
last week, and oh, how we do wish
that they would write again. So come
on, friend. Those letters help our
county paper. mere were eignt
pages last week.
We are invited to a picnic and children's
day at Palmetto Baptist church
next Saturday, Oct. the 14th, but we
were not invited to advertise it, nor
to go without a well-filled basket, but
anyway we invite Editor Hcarn.
Mr. S. T. Atkinson made a business
trip to Angelus last Saturday.
We have received a sample copy
of a new paper, the name is "Appeal
to Reason," and we do hope that the

writers are blessed with good roads
already.
Best wishes to The Advertiser and

% Ruby Graded School
I Opened last Monday
The Ruby Graded School hud its
formal opening last Monday. The
exercises were presided over by Mr.
McGregor, one of the trustees.
After Scripture reading.and prayer
hy the Rev. Paul T. Wood, Maj. W.
J. Tiller was introduced. After a
few pointed remarks about school affairs
in general Maj. Tiller spoke of
his work as Demonstration Aerent. He
2 explained to his audience that igncrB
ance of soil nature had cost the South
K enough money to build many new
ff school houses. The figures presented
by Major Tiller formed a strong arguIment
in favor of the scientific side of
j farming. He mentioned many items
I of expenditure amounting to millions
' of dollars and made a noble effort to
1 impress it upon the minds of the
4L i school hoys that by preparing thomJ
I selves for the farm, they, as farmers, I
| coul l save all this good S?uth Caro%
lina money. The speaker had stopped
^ by the roadside and pulled a bunch 1
M j of clover which he used in his adds
dress, explaining to the boys what
jb was meant by "inoculation" and
Jr showing the "nodules" containing a
0 very expensive part of the South's
fertilizer bill. With a few pointed
? re mar. s to the girls about Canning
Club work, Mr. Tiller closed his ad
/>j dress by recommending I'rof. W. K.
Wilson, as a graduate of an agricultural
college.
Mr. McGregor then arose to sanction
from a merchant's viewpoint, the
remarks of Mr. Tiller. Mr. Grigg:w:is
then called upon to speak for the
<3 board of trustees. This he did brief|ly
hut pointedly, calling attention first
^ | of the teachers to their duties nml
<3 responsibilities, lit- then assured the
faculty that the hoard of trustees
^-5 would uphold them in their work and
closed with a few words of exhortation
to the few patrons who were
^ present.
.l".\ Mr. McGregor called for voluntary
speeches and the Rev. A. I?. Smith.
JS. Mr. S. J. Sellers and Mr. .1. Sidney
^ Smith responded.
'.3 The outlook for a successful term
?? of school is bright.
^ The faculty is as follows: Prof. W
v7, K. Wilson, principal; Misses Ada
Wylis, Marie Smith, Kloise Wright
^ and Mrs. Florence K. Lucas. Miss
Charlotte llarrell will he in charge <
'V? the music class. All these are new
v3 teachers in Ruby except Miss Wylie.

ies which proved fatal a few days
