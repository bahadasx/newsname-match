WHO WERE THE COWARDS
ON THE 7TH OF MARCH?
Charges of cowardice or vacillation made against
President Wilson come in ill grace from republican news
papers of republican orators in view of the republican rec
ord on the McLemore "scuttle" resolution.
The one great "showdown" of the war came when this
resolution was disposed of in congress. The resolution
was an attempt to keep American citizens from traveling
on armed merchantmen even though international law
allows such travel. The resolution was a "white feather"
proposal. It was introduced at a time when relations be
tween the United States and Germany were strained al
most to the breaking point. It was favored by men who
were afraid of a war with Germany.
The situation wa3 such that President Wilson called
upon congress to show its colors and decide whether the
influence of the American government or of a foreign
government should be supreme in this nation.
In the house the administration forces moved to table
the McLemore resolution and one of the great congres
sional fights of modem history was enacted. The reso
lution was favored by the republican organization headed
by Minority Leader Mann. The vote to table earned 276
to 142. Of those voting for the "white feather" proposal
101 were republicans.
, In other words the record shows that when the real
test came last March the republican party, as represented
in congress was the Darty of the "cold foot." The house
republicans under their recognized leadership opposed
the vigorous Americanism of Woodrow Wilson and fa
vored a proposal that was both cowardly and weak. The
nation's honor and prestige were upheld by democratic
votes.
Tory newspapers now assailing Wilson on the score
of cowardice should look to the congressional record for
March 7, 1916. and observe that they are barking at the
wrong man and the wrong political party.

Marion County Teachers Say
Eastern Oregon Should Have
Normal; 400 at Institution
Pass Resolution of Support.
Hy unanimous vote taken yesterday
the delegstes to the state federatiol
of women's clubs In session at Sea
side endorsed the measure for a state
normal school at Pendleton. A mes
sage to this effect was received here
last evening from Mrs. Roy T. Bish
op and the news Is confirmed by re
ports In the Portland papers. The
Monmouth delegation aided In the
pa"age of the resolution.
Marion county Help.
Further good news has been re
ceived to the effect that 400 teachers
of Marlon county, assembled In in
stitute, have endorsed the eastern
Oregon bill. As reported by County
Superintendent W M. Smith of Ma
rion county the resolution passed was
na follows;
Be It resolved, that this institute go
on record as favoring the establish
ment of the Eastern Oregon Normal
School at Tendleton as per proposed
legislation."
In a personal letter to the local
committee Superintendent Smith has
made known his own sentiments on
the bill as follows:
8ALRM, Ore., Oct, 10. I heartily
favor the establishment of a normel
school nt Pendleton. The great need
of the public schools of Oregon is for
trained teachers. Very few of the
students of the Normal School at
Monmouth come from eastern Oregon
showing that the Monmouth school
does not serve to any great extent
that part of the state which Is east of
the Cascades. I shall, therefore, lend
my Influence and support to the pas
sage of a bill to establish a normal
school at Pendleton.
W. M. SMITH.
Superintendent of Marion County,
Oregon.
