Charlevoix 7.
Local Foot Ball Team Wins
From Old Rivals at Charlevoix
The pig skin manipulators of the
hischool staged a fast and interest
ing game at Charlevoix last Friday
afternoon and incidentally showed that
they could "come back" after a bad de
feat at the hands of Boyne City. For
several years the locals have been un
able to defeat Charlevoix on their home
grounds, but this time they vindicated
themselves and played their opponents
off their feet from the first whistle.
Charlevoix won the toss and chose to
defend the west goal, thereby having
the advantage of a stiff breeze and the
sun at their backs. Cross kicked off
for East Jordan and Durrance of Char
levoix ran the baft back to the 45 yard
line where he was tackled by Milford
and was slightly injured by a cut over
the eye. This was soon taken care of
and proved to be the only injury re
ceived during the game. After failing
to gain through the line Charlevoix
punted and the local team recovered
t hp, ball and began a march for the goal
liuevfchich resulted in a touchdown" by
Croat Goal kick failed and the score
was (to 0 for visitors. In a few min
utes more Milford manipulated another
touchdown from a fake formation,
making the score 12 to 0 in the first
eight minutes of play. Then Charle
voix worked a successful forward pass,
Butler to Cartier and the latter proved
too fast for the East Jordan defense
and the play resulted in a touchdown.
Charlevoix kicked goal and the score
was 12 to 7.
By this time the local boys had be
gun to play good ball and scores follow
ed in quick succession, Charlevoix be
ing unable to stop the line plunging of
Cross and the open field work of the
other backs and ends of the visitors.
The game ended with East Jordan on
the big end of a 31 to 7 score.
This game showed that the high
school has a team which should give
any other team in this part of the state
a run for its money. Every player on
the team played a good game and the
defensive work of Giffin and Dicken
was remarkable, both being sure tack
les and never failing to get their man.
On offensive Cross and Milford made
most of the gains, good work being
done also by Dicken, Porter andNacha
zel. Several forward passes were
gathered in by Lalonde and Giffin
which resulted in long gains. Fowler
at center is a strong defensive player
and when needed can stop many of the
opponents plays before they are under
way. Cummins and Jones at guards
and Jepson at right tackle made up a
line which Charlevoix found too strong
to gain through.
'Vie game was clean throughout, the
local boys offending by rough play
only a few times and rarely losing
their heads. With one or two excep
tions the Charlevoix boys also proved
to be good sportsmen but theirs was
the usual rowdy element present
among the spectators.
Principal Asletine of Charlevoix was
the referee.
The return game will be played with
Charlevoix at the ball grounds on the
Commons this Friday afternoon, Oct.
13, at 3:30 p. m. If you like to see a
good clean sport, don't miss this game.
The local team is out to win but will
guarantee you a fast and clean game if
you will attend.

School Commissioner's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Comroiiiioner
Too busy now to do much talking.
Seventeen visits made last week.
Boyne Valley teachers met at Boyne
Falls on Wednesday. Only one teacher
absent.
Hudson teachers met at the Hudson
townhall on Friday. All present but
one. All had to face difficulties to get
to the meeting.
The Hudson Township Mother's Club
held an open meeting on Friday, Oct.
6th at the Hoffman school house. There
was an active and thoughtful crowd
present. The Com'r spoke at length
on conditions in that locality, the ideal
school, and what the unit system would
mean in Hudson township. Delicious
coffee and sandwiches were served
after the program.
Visits in Boyne Valley found that the
Boyne Falls village schools had provid
ed a new boiler for the heating system,
had retinted all four rooms, and oiled
the floors, and varnished the seats.
They have engaged an assistant high
school teacher this year to make possi
ble the eleven grade system and next
to complete a twelve grade course.
There is no reason why this high school
should not draw from all the surround
ing country in its future enrollment if
it steps to the front in improvement
and course of study.
The Slaughter school is clothed in a
new dress of glossy varnish and fresh
paint. A bank of windows af the left
affords them a glass area equal to about
one-fifth of the floor area. Providing
warm cloak room and a supervised hall
way is the only correction worthy of
note standing between them and a
"Standard Plate."
There are some very good schools in
the east of this county and everything
is going finely.
The Clinton school, Hudson No. 5.
has installed a floor warmer system and
ventilator put out by the Round Oak
Co. This district suffered a severe
loss by fire two years ago and should
be given special credit for the hold
which they have taken of things in the
brief time which they have had in
which to recuperate.
The Heart Lake school in Hudson
No. 4. has been repainted, reshingled
and the interior tinted in approved
shades.
There has been an undercurrent of
thought to the effect that Hudson and
Boyne Valley are a lonely lumbering
country. To be sure in many cases the
schools are small but, say, for equip
ment and school spirit they will make
some of our schools nearer town sit up
and take notice.
Report your truancy, teachers, check
it and double check it. After a case
has been in the truant officer's hands
once report directly to him. The law
is going to, be enforced and it is up to
you.
Home credit verily booming. 98 par
ents out of every one hundred boosting
for this method of co-operation. Of
course the system has been made com
pulsory by requiring these credits be
fore a child can be promoted but for
the big majority of teachers and par
ents this clause would not have been
necessary. The teachers have all been
boosters and the parents have proved
to be monarchs behind their thrones.
Our boys and girls have shown an al
most unbelievable energy.

The "Home
Amendment
Proposed Amendment to be Known as Section
30 of Article VIII
"Section 30. Every incorporated city,
every incorporated village and every organ
ized township (meaning thereby all that
part of a township outside the limits of an
incorporated city or village located partly or
wholly therein) shall each have the right to
determine by-a majority vote of the electors
thereof, whether or not there shall be pro
hibited therein the manufacture and sale of
malt, brewed' fermented, vinous, distilled
or intoxicating liquors.
The "Joker"
Appropriate legislation shall be enacted
to enforce and make effective the provisions
of this section and until such legislation is
enacted, existing local option regulatory
laws on this subject shall continue in force;
but no existing law inconsistent with the
provisions of this section shall continue in
force after Jan. 1, 1919."
The "Joker" is so worded as to void the
prohibition amendment should both amend
ments carry. Dry voters will vote "Yes" on
the prohibition amendment and "No" on the
above.
To reduce the unit as the ''Home Rule"
proposes, will merely magnify the only weak
ness of the county local option law, making
it possible to vote a city dry and surrounding
townships wet, or vice versa.

. age Over( Desert.
Headquarters American Punitive
Expedition, Mexico. There Is a rather
matured story told to illustrate the
pride a man may take In his work and
how apt he Is to be extremely Jealous
of that work. It relates how two
street sweepers were discussing the
merits of a deceased member of their
cruft.
"Jake was a mighty handy man with
the brush," declared the first sweeper
in an effort of praise. I
"Yes," said the other, slowly, "he
was that. But now that he's gone,
Hank, don't you think he was Just a
little weak around the lamp posts?"
There should be asterisks or some
thing here, because the scene shifts
suddenly to "somewhere in Mexico,"
and those who follow this narration
find themselves on the aviation field
at the edge of headquarters camp, the
day a relief aeroplane Is expected to
arrive.. Her starting point Is a mili
tary secret, but It Is sufficient to say
that she would complete a Journey of
150 miles by the time she gilded to the
ground at this camp.
Finally, far over the mountain
runge, the machine wa sighted. The
aviator was having a rough time of it,
caught in the swirls and eddies that
suck up out of the rough mountain
country. Then the machine fought
clear and hovered over the field, ap
parently seeking a place to alight. Fi
nally the machine made a sudden
swoop, struck the roughest part of the
field, bumped badly, skidded and tip
ped, but finally righted Itself and
rolled to a standstill.
How They Were Greeted.
The aviator assigned to headquar
ters strolled leisurely out to greet the
newcomer. They reached the machine
as he and the observer were climbing
stiffly from their seats and unbutton
ing leather Jackets. One felt that It
was a moment lnwhlch these casual
Rule'

young tempters of destruction might
relax a bit. In France, one Imagined,
there might be an embrace, at least.
Probably a slight peck on the cheek.
Jake had really shown that he was
a mighty hundy man with the brush.
Put did they relax? Here Is what
happened?
"Hello," said the headquarters avia
tor. "Howdy," replied the visiting pilot.
There followed a keen survey of the
visiting machine.
"Bum rudder wheel," said the head
quarters aviator.
The visitor said nothing, but peeled
off his Jacket and picked up the mall
bag.
"How long did It take you to make
the trip?" asked the headquarters
flier.
"Exactly an hour and a half," stated
the visitor, somewhat proudly.
"We did It In an hour and twenty
eight minutes," returned the headquar
ters aviator.
"Of course we lost a lot of time In
that storm," said the visitor.
"Put you had a stiff wind behind
you," retorted headquarters. "How
much weight did you carry?"
"About 3,400 pounds."
"We carried 3,700 and a lot of extra
equipment."
No Boost Here.
Another sour inspection of the visit
ing 'plane, nccompanled by uplifted
eyebrows on the part of the second
headquarters man, who finally asked:
"How Is that new patent adjuster
working?"
"Great," responded the visitor, en
couraged. "We get along fine without it ," said
headquarters.
The visitor surveyed the headquar
ters men a moment quizzically.
"Anyway," he said, "both of us got
here and brought the machine."
"Yes," said the first headquarters
man. "Put you had a messy time of it
over Sugar Lump pass."
Jake might have been a little weak
around the lamp posts.
Beauty may be only skin deep, but
the plump girl gets.the most joy rides.
It is easier for a man to be the archi
tect of his own fortune than to be the
builder. '
EASIRR TO STOP NOW
It is easier to check a bronchial cough
now than later. Coughs grow worse
the longer they continue. Foley's Hon

allays inflammation and irritation, re
stores sore and discharging membranes
to healthy condition, opens congested
air passages, and affords longed for
relief. Hite's Drug Store.
PRAIRIE DOGS INVADE CITY
Mysterious Couple Take Up Life In
Kansas City Business District
and Make Friends. v
Kansas City. Without any visible
means of support, and with only
enough furniture and luggage to start
light housekeeping, two Kansas prairie
dogs took lodging under a wall here
last spring. A shy, retiring couple,
they seemed to shun society. They
were never at home to callers.
But sometimes, on sunny afternoons,
the employees of the printing company
next door could see the little animals
emerge from their hole under the wall
and play among the rubbish and frag
ments of old pavement In the yard.
By and by the prairie dogs learned the
printers meant no harm, and accepted
small favors, such as bunches of sweet
grass, nuts and apples, from them.
No one knows where the prairie
dogs came from. One man said they
escaped from a circus menagerie. An
other held the theory they had run
away from someone who had tried to
tame them and make them Into house
hold pets.
At any rate, there they are, next
door to Kansas City's business dis
trict. The appearance of strangers on
their doorstep is a signal for retire
ment to the depths of their hole-ln-the-wall.
A photographer waited more
than an hour to get a glimpse of the
prairie dogs. Finally he was com
pelled to take the picture from the In
terior of the prlntshop, thrusting the
camera through the window.

on August 8, 1915, at Stone Harbor,
while "she was stupefied and was not
aware of her existence."
She alleges that her husband had
the power of putting her Into a trance.
Mrs. Mead says that later her husband
told her that he married her only for
a Joke, and to get possession of her in
heritance, saying that he had already
run through two, that of his mother
and hfs daughter. Mrs. Mead says her
husband told her that his first wife
lasted only a year and his second wife
only five years. The court granted a
subpoena.
