FOOT BALL DOFF
Yal High lost by a narrow margin
to the Giants of Cros well last Friday
in as fine a srarae of rugby as was ever
Btaged on the lattei'a zrldirou.
Outweighing the Yale boys by 300
pounds, Croswell was unable to score
the (irwt half owing to the gait and
epi'ed of thu visitor and the tl rut 22
minutes of play closed with honors
even.
In the thirl j i irtt'r, with Tics sub
stituted and other rha'ige on the line,
the picskiu wan forced over for three
touchdown, two of which were sup
planted by place kicks.
The last quarter wan a replica of the
first half and, although" Y&Ie placed
ball within a yard of her opponents goal
it fell at the fourth down and neither
team scored. Finals were 20 to 0.
The Croswell eleven is a clean, square
aggregation of eligibles and deserve
their victory.

By Uaymond Wilks
When 1 entered the old cabin with
my uncle, where he had lived with his
small family from his marriage until
two years ago, a quet smile played
UDon his care worn face.
"You see, child," he said, "this seems
like home. No," looking at the almost
bare walls, "It doesn't either, because
Ktta and Howard are not here to meet
us."
After hie wife's and little son's death
death my uncle had come to live with
us, and as we were taking a tramp In
the woods for a day or so, we thought
the old cabin a good place to spend the
night.
When supper was over; when we had
gathered wood to last for the night
and the lire on the hearth was sending
a ruddy glow through the cabin, uncle
began to tell of the times spent in the
cabin when all were there.
"You see, things were different then,
lad ! The walls didn't look so bare as
they do tonight. Do you see where
that bit of plaster is off V Well, a pic
ture used to hang there, and it makes
me feel lonesome without it, for How
ard used to look at it by the hour. Oh !
you see that old cupboard, do you?
Yes, that stood opposite that little pic
ture all the while we lived here. And
that little bench! I made it and Ftta
covered it, and Howard thought it was
so pretty. It has never been moved."
I tried to get him to talk about
something more pleasant, so I said,
"And I suppose you found lots of big
game up here, uncle V"
"YeB," he said, "I had the pleasure of
carrying a small deer home on my back
one day. I shot him three miles west
of here. And such a greeting as I re
ceived I But now everything is bo still!
We hung a piece of meat on that very
nail, lad. But, dear me, we must go to
bed now. Come, lad."
As I slowly followed my uncle, I
turned to gaze at the old room, won
dering if it, too, missed the cheerful
presence of the little boy and mother,
and cherished the fond memories my
uncle did.

Mr. and Mrs. Lavell, both novr de

lowing this rule they enjoyed the
friendship and respect of a large circle
of warm friends and neighbors,

M. P. Church Notes
Kkv. F. L. Ckandall, Fastor.
Our rally was a decided success, 123
beiug preseut, and the school will go
forth with renewed interest! We re
gret the illness that prevents some of
our faithful outs from attending church
and Sunday school.
At this writing we cannot announce
the subjects for next Sunday's services,
but you who have heard the splendid
addresses which our pastor Is giving
us, will know there is something good
in store for you.
A large number from this church
autoed to Fort Huron last Monday to
hear Billy Sunday, and all agree the
time was well spent. His theme should
interest every man and woman in this
state of ours. We believe your vote
this coming Nov. 7 will me&u more to
you aud jours than any vote you ever
cast in your life. We pray you may
vote for God and right. J ust ask your
self, "What would Jesus do?"
The meeting held at our church on
Wednesday eveuing in behalf of state
wide prohibition, was well attended.
The 1 4. A. S. met at the home of
Mrs. Wm. Keunedy this week Wed

PREPARE THE
CHILDREN FOR
LATER YEARS
piIERE is no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education and
training depend upon how much the parents can afford to
spend.
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will 'Willie hare to forego bis dreams of being a ciril engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training she hat been
looking forward to? Will they bet compelled after achool
years are passed to take their place with Ue underpaid men
and women, untrained, without a vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Bank your money or better still, de
posit a little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
come there will be no necessary "Limping" to start them off right.
