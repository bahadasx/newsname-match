pension roll would be 1,200 short of
what it was last year, on account of
the fact that all pensioners were
forced to make new application to
each of the county pension boards,
this having been required as a result
of a law passed by "the last legisla

of mhi.rtfd "to take iffscir
meur tending to pr ent V i.st
crept submarines, regnrdle. t ,f their
, to avail themelve of neutral
wafer, roadstead and harbor."
Thre government point out the fa
cility powund by such craft to avoid
supervision or surveillance or deter
minntion of thfir national character
and their power to "do injury that
in inherent in their very nature," a
well as the "additional facilities" af
forded by having at their disposal
places where they can rest and re
plenish their supplies.
Apparently on these grounds the
allied governments hold that "sub
marine vessels must be excluded from
the benefit of the rules heretofore
accepted under international law re
garding the admission and sojourn
of war and merchant vessels in neu
tral waters, roadsteads or harbors;
any submarine of a belligerent that
once enters a neutral harbor must be
held there," and therefore, the allied
governments "warn neutral powers
of the great danger to neutral sub
marines attending the navigation of
waters visited by the submarines of
belligerents."
In reply the government of the
United States must express its sur
prise that there appears to be an en
deavor of the allied powers to deter
mine the rule of action governing
what they regard as "a novel situa
tion" in respect to the use of subma
rines in time of war and to enforce
acceptance of thatjrule, at least in
part, by warning neutral powers of
the great danger to their submarines
n waters that may be visited by bel-j
ligerent submarines.
In the' opinion of the government
of the United States the allied pow
ers have not set forth any circum
stances, nor is the government of the
United States at present aware of
any circumstances, concerning the
use of war or merchant submarines
which would render the existing rules
of international law inapplicable to
them.
In view of this fact and of the no
tice this warning of the allied pow
ers announced in their memoranda
under acknowledgment it is incum
bent upon the government of the
United States to notify the govern
ments of France, Great Britain, Rus
sia and Japan that, so far as the
treatment of either war or merchant
submarines in American waters is
concerned the government of the
United States reserves its liberty of
action in all respects and will treat
such vessels as, in its opinion, be
comes the action of a power which
may be said to have taken the first
step toward establishing the princi
ples of neutrality and which for over
5i century has maintained those prin
ciples in the traditional spirit and
with the high sense of impartiality
in which they were conceived.
In order, however, that there
should be no misunderstanding as to
the attitude of the United States, the
government of the United States an
nounces to the allied powers that it
holds it to be the duty of belligerent
powers to distinguish between Bub
marines of neutral and belligerent
nationality and that responsibility for
any conflict that may arise between
belligerent warships and neutral sub
marines on account of the neglect of
a belligerent to so distinguish be
tween these classes of submarines
must rest entirely upon th,e negligent
power. .
29 Cents for Cotton.

yesterday sold to A, K. Sabin & Co.
100 bales of cotton at 29 cents

this season, and the banner price for
the Greenwood market The cotton
sold was of a high grade, extra long

of a lot of cotton of this size for the
price like the above speaks well for
the Greenwood market. The buyers
here are the most progressive to be
found anywhere in the delta, and are
always ready to bunch the top when
the cotton' is brought to this market.

on November 1, 2 and 3, The fi

made. The board of supervisors and
the city council each gave $100 and
all of the city banks have contributed
$25 each, while several large dona

for a ball on the opening night of
the reunion, the grand march to be
led by Gen. Calvin B. Vance, of
Batesville, commander of the division,
and Mrs. E. T. Sykes, of this city,
matron of honor for the occasion.
Toasts will be responded to by the
state president of the Confederate

prominent members of the organiza

at the Industrial Institute and Col

maids of honor will be entertained
with a dance by the Choctaw Club.
One of the big features, of, the re

Director of the local Chamber of
Commerce held a mretmt Mnndny
night, antf decided in send W. II. Car
ter to Jackson, Misn., to m before th
members of the Farm Loan Board
when they meet in that city October
31, and present the claims of Colum
bus for a Farm Loan bank.
The movement to secure a Farm
Loan Bank for Columbus was inaug
urated by J. G. Weatherly, former
secretary of the Civic Chamber, but
as Mr. Weatherly tendered his resig
nation soon after application for one
of the banks was officially made, and
the position has since been vacant,
nothing has been done towards col
lecting the necessary data to plai t-
before the Farm Loan board. How
ever, as formal application for tlv
bank had already been made it was
decided to send Mr. Carter, who once
served as secretary of the Civic
Chamber, to Jackson to represent the
city's interests.
Several gentlemen filed application
for the position of secretary, but
the directors, after having discussed
the matter at some length, decided
to defer action until a subsequent
meeting.
The meeting Monday night was the
first to be held by the directors for
the ensuing year who were named at
the recent annual meeting of mem
bers, aud Mr. S. B. Street, Jr., the
new president,' outlined his policy,
whifch he declared would be a live and
progressive one. , ,
Miss Ella Mae Jordan tendered her
resignation as assistant secretary,
and same was accepted with regret..
Miss Jordan has been in the employ
of the Civic Chamber for a long time,
and since the departure of former
Secretary Weatherly a few weeks ago
the duties of that position have de
volved largely upon her. She has
discharged these duties in a nAt ac
ceptable manner, and the fact that
she has decided to sever her connec
tion with the organization is univers
ally regretted.
The directors unanimously adopted
a resolution expressing sympathy for
Mr. V. B. Imes, a popular member
of the board, who has been ill at his
home on South Seventh avenue for
several weeks. Mr. Imes is not only
one of the most popular but one of
the most progressive and enthusiastic
members of the board, and during his
illness his fellow directors have sadly
missed his aid and counsel,
i Several other matters were dis
cussed by the directors, one of the
most important having been the re
moval of the Confederate monument
from its present location on the court
house square to the corner of Main
and Market streets, which is the rec
ognized business center of the city.
It was originally intended to erect
the monument on this site, and its
removal would meet with public ap

week's deliberation, following the ar

supreme court, sitting en banc, Mon

on the injunction ordered to issue
several weeks ago by Chancellor Tay

on the Weakly quart-at-a-time law,
the Richardson game and fish law,
and the whiskey anti-advertising law,
the court holding that chancellors or
other courts , of this state have no
jurisdiction to stop the holding of an
election by means or a writ of injunc-

The court's decision was not unan-

This ruling means that the people
of this state will have the opportunity
at the coming November election, to
