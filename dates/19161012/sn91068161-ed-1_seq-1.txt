Every Mother Urged to Attned, As the
Meeting Is of Vital Importance
Enrllment by Grades.
Plans are being rapidly perfected
for the organization of a Mother's
Club at Hendersonville graded school
Friday afternoon of this week, the
meeting to start at 3; 30 o'clock. The
35 members of the Woman's Club of
Hendersonville are lending their aid
to the movement ajd prospects are
bright for an initial membership of
at least 75, and it is hoped to increase
ttxTs to 150 or more.
. Tuesday Superintendent Blackstock
sent out letters to every mother of
school children in Hendersonville,
stating the reasons and importance of
organizing a mother's club and urg
ing them to lend their active support,
and it is expected that the meeting
Friday afternoon will be very en
thusiastic. Mr. Blackstock's letter follows:
"Although inestimable and abiding
good is being accomplished daily by
our public school, it nevertheless is
continually . handicapped by such
means as cannot be overcome by sup
erintendent and teachers. Inadequate
equipment and an inadequate number
of teachers, together with the pub
lic's astounding lack of consciousness
of these needs, demand strong moral
and material action in order to pie
vent the stagnation of the public edu
cational system of Hendersonville.
Therefore deliverance from these coi
jdifions is sought at the hands of those

NEW SERIES BUILDING AND
LOAN OPENS OCTOBER 21
Attention of our readers is directed
to the advertisement of the Laborers
Building and Loan Association ap
pearing elsewhere in this paper. A
new series will begin Saturday, Octo
ber 21, and all who desire to take
out shares should make application at
once.
This association has been in busi
ness here seven years and during that
time has helped build more than 10 J
homes, thus being a large factor in
the upbuilding of our city. The build
ing and loan way has long been rec
ognized as the easiest way or per
sons of small means to own their own
homes, a3 the weekly payments for
the stock amount to no more than
rent and therefore are hardly missed.
As an investment the building and
loan pays more than 6 per cent, in
terest and' is one of the best means
ever devised for saving money.
' By taking out building and loan
stock you help your city grow and
also better yourself. If you are not
thinkinW- of building a home, take out
a few shares as an investment. You
will be proud of it in years to come. .
The officers of the Laborers' Build- I
ing and Loan Association are all well- j
known" and responsible business men
of the city. W. A. Smith is president;
R. H. ' Staton, vice-president; H. A.
Stepp, secretary and treasurer. Mr. 1
Stepp or either of the other officers
win h E-lari to exnlain the building
and loan' plan to any one making the
request. ' '

day for the Fassiferja girls. Mrs. Mc-
Bee and Miss Sliipp entertained' the
school at a most enjoyable pJci7con
Stoney mountain in honor of Fassi

with a merry chatter. Everything
tempting to eat consisted in the abun

rambling in the woods and gathering
the flowers of autumn. The hour of
the evening came too soon for return
ing. SOngs of Fassifern and cheers to
the hostesses continued as the party
descended the mountain.
Saturday morning during breakfast
Mrs. McBee and Miss Shipp were
given a pleasant surprise, when a
large porch seat was carried into the
dining room and presented, as a gift,
to Fassifern from the student body.
This was the ninth celebration of
Fassifern's birthday, and we wish for
Fassifern many more happy and suc
cessful years.
The music department, under the
directorship of Miss Chelian A. Pixley
is full to overflowing.
The two new departments, domes
tic science and domestic art. which
have been added to Fassifern this
year, have splendid prospects for
large classes, the former having ten
in number already.

AMERICA SEEING AI1D
T
Tourists Shuld Visit Hendersonville.
Will be Benefitted and Return
Home Refreshed. .
(By Old Hurrygraph.)
When you talk - of travel so many
people regard it as something for a
favored few, and it means-the spend
ing of much money. . There is one
class of travel that crosses oceans and
continents, and is expensive; but that
Is not .the only kind. A trip that is
most beneficial, and really worth
whilie, is not necessarily , a long one.
The spirit of America seeing, and
America enjoyment counts much to
the American. .
There are thousands of women and
men who need only to pass from their
regular daily surroundings to environ
ments that are fresh, sweet and pure
if only for a day or two. .Do this one
a year and life is refreshed and stored
with new energy and strength. . This
does not carry with it the idea of dis
content; but you should gain new
views, a broader interest in America's
attractions, and . the healtn-giving ad
vantages of your own country which
are beyond the range of your daily
vision and intercourse.
The farmer needs to break away
from his fields and daily routine; the
city man from pavements and "SKy
scrapers"; the lawyer from his office;
the merchant from his desk; artisans
from . their shops; society folks from
the" whirl of their pleasures. If they
never leave these daily rounds they
are wilfully starving themselves de
priving themselves of what is best in
iii'e. '
The true spirit cf travel is to be
eager to see ajiother any other
place than the spot in which you live,
move and have your occupation ox
calling. Where to go, and how to gee
there is often a perplexing question.
Let me suggest a beautiful spot; na
ture's open air sanitariam a moun
tain "roof garden" Western North
Carolina. Hendersonville, the gateway
tothe; government's AppaJachmh'Part
on ' the Southern Railway. Once visit
this" section, and 'jmfortably
house yourself in te beautiful Caro
lina Terrace for a sojourn in this de
lightful all-the-year-round climate, you
will be truly benefitted, and will re
turn home refreshed, full of content
ment to the blessings that are yours
at home.
October and November in and
around Hendersonville, N. C, are pe
culiarly fitted to the delight of the
autumn and winter tourists. There is
just enough crispiness in the air to
make it exceptionally exhilarating, in
vigorating and intoxicating wjth the'
joy of life. There is a mellowness
and softness in the sunshine that
cheers and charms one to outdoor ex
ercise. Nature touches and tints the
forests with all colors of the rainbow,
as if the dye-ptfis of leaven had been
literally emptied out upon the moun
tains and the gorgeous colorings had
trickled down to the little rivulets in
the valleys below, where the autumn
flowers nod and primp their beautiful
heads in the mirrored reflections of
the glassy waters. Health and vigor
rides upon every breeze., and paints the
roses upon the cheeks of the palid.
Nature here seems ever beckoning one
to, come and romp with her. Sublim
ity and beauty are not usually con
vertible, terms. They do not mean
the same. Grandeur is austere. Yet
at Hendersonville one finds the most
singular of the- two incompatibilities.
The grandeur of the mountains is
over all, ,the overpowering sentiment
of this beautiful town and its environ
ment. In all thenooks and bends of
the valleys, peaks and prominences,
nestle the other beauty beyond com
pare. The specific charm of each at
traction cannot here be described.
Once visited, they remain ever after
pictures of the mind, never put into,
words. Hendersonville, and the Car
olina Terrace, cordially invites .the
autumn and winter tourists ta see a
beautiful spot in America and to en
joy the the feasts nature has here
spread for the health, pleasure and
enjoymient of humanity.

BOARD OF TfiADE ;
Resignation of Secretary Bridges Ac
ceted With Regrets -Several
Committees Appointed. ;
A meeting of the Hendersonville
Board of Trade, President J. W.
Bailey presiding, was held in the city
hall Monday night, at - which time the
resignation of W.. Marshall Bridges
as secretary of the organization was
accepted with regrets, and the mat
ter of employing a new secretary was
left open for several months.
An executive committee composed
of C E. Brooks, chairman; A. S.
Truex, C. F Bland, W. P. Whitmire
and R. M. Oates. was appointed, the
association having been without an
executive committee ever since its re
organization. The matter of a debt owed by the
old Greater Hendersonville Club took
up a considerable part of the eve
ning's business, and brought out some
lively discussion. Action was taken
on this matter in that a committee
composed of A. S. Truex, E. G. Still
well, W. V. Whitmire. 'E. W. Ewbank
and W. Marshall Bridges, was ap
pointed to seo what they could do in
the way of collecting some old notes
the money to be applied in the dis-
charge of . this obligation
The present board of trade has just
about enough money to break even
on the present year's work.
A letter was read from an Ashe
ville man, who applied for the posi
tion of Secretary, and also one from
Miss Annie D. Mitchell, who proposed
to make a personal canvas of homes
in fifteen towns and cities of Florid
this winter advertising Henderson
ville for a stated sum of money, buc
no action was taken on either mat
ter. ,
Mr. Bridge's resignation, as handed'
in to the board, and which explains
his reasonr, for resigjiing. is as fol
Ioyvs: To the Members of the Hendersonville
Board of Trade, Hendersonville,
North Carolina.
Gentlemen: : r v ;
J , jDuringbeast- niH jnibiifchfiy
enaeavorea. 10 serve you; ana tne oesr
interests of ' Hendersonville v generally,
as Secretary of the Board of. Trade.
How well this :work has been done,
you who are' fanailiar with the work
can best determine. The failure- to
accomplish for Hendersonville many
undertakings which I desired Jfco see
consumated, is very evident to me. I
am convinced, however, that I could
have rendered more and better service
in this organization in which we are
all interested if it had been possible
for me to devOte more time to th?
w6rk in hand. The circumstances at
tending my employment have made it
necessary that the Board of Trade and
its objects and undertakings have a
secondary place in my thoughts and
ja second demand upon my time. My
first interests have been, of course,
the interests of my clients. As the
work of my profession has increased,
my attention to the Board of Trade
objects has, from necessity, dimin
ished. In the light of the above I can no
longer remain Secretary of your or-
jganization and give to it the time and
thought which it demands and which
it . is entitled to if this organization
is to have its proper place in the ful-
! fillment of our desires for Henderson
ville. ;I4 therefore, earnestly request
that you accept my resignation as
Secretary of thex Hendersonville
Board of Trade, the same to take ef
fect at the next meeting of the or
ganization, Monday evening, Octo
ber 9.
In tendering this, my resignation, I
do so with a keen sense of apprecia
tion of the hearty co-operation and en
couragement I have received at the
hands of practically all members of!
the board, and with an abiding convic
tion that Hendersonville will eventual
ly prove a fulfillment of our desires
and become in reality the best city in
Western North Carolina. Though fe
signing as Secretary from necessity
due to my increasing law practice, I
pledge to Hendersonville my loyal
and unwavering support and devotion
to every interest that will make our
city a better place in which to live,
and to this end I stand to serve
wherever my services are needed.
Respectfully submitted,
