noon. At the railroad station and along
the strrrts cheeri greeted him.
Cheered on Way Witt.
President Wilson was greeted by
crowds of cheering people at Dayton,
Ohio, and Richmond, Ind , as he passed

receive such welcome.
Almost Mobbed.
Leaning over the observation platforht
of his private car at Dayton, the
president was almost mobbed by a good
natured crowd of several thousand per
sons who sought to (hake hands with

ALL DESTROYERS

NO KINGSTONIAN WAS SUNK
Rear Admiral Gleaves Decides
Report a Mistake.
WASHINGTON, fM. 12-Whi!e no
immediate steps are in contemplation
fur the actual establishment of a naval
neutrality patrol along the Atlantic
coast as a result of the (.erman sub
marine raid, the navv department has
completed a detfnite plan to he put into
operation if the campaign continues.
Patrol by Destroyers.
The rntire destroyer force, active
and reserve, assisted by ligjit cruisers,
navy tugs anil other auxiliary craft,
will he employed to protect American
lerritoriaP waters and also to prevent
thr establishment of anv enmmunica
tion with shore radio stations and out
bound craft.
Situation Clears Up.
The whole stihmarine question, both
as to thr raid off thr Nrw Kngland
coast, and thr broader question of agi
tation in dermany for a ruthlrss rr
sumptinn of thr warfare shows signs
in officii quart(w;?if having practical
ly clrarW up. S.
May Establish Precedent.
Government officials today were pon
dering he question of whether the
I'ntted States shall acknowledge the
raid of the (ierman war submarine
U-5.1 on allied shipping off Nantucket
last Sunday as legal. The problem
was considered of great importance not
only in its relation to that particular
raid, hut because of the probability
that it will establish a precedent af
fecting possible future submarine for
ages of similar nature.
No Kinistonian Suck.
Rear Admiral (.leaves, commanding
the Atlantic destroyer flotilla, reported
today his personal belief that no steam
er Kingstorrian was sunk by the Ger
man submarine during its operations off
Nantucket lightship. After several days'
search the destroyer force has found no
evidence that a ship of that name was
in. the vicinitv; and if Admiral Gleaves'
theory is 'correct, only five ships were
sunk.

across the approaches to those plants.
Polict Hold Fort.
Inside this line between the strik

not all will receive the full shares anoi
it is understood the players have agreed
