EDITORIAL IN K
T HE Courier is glad to note that the
citizens of the Oakway section of
j Oconee have taken hold of the National
Rural Credits association work in earnest
e and wijh. success. These 'citizens are
a golng''to get in line for the securing of
e funds at low rates of interest and for
long terms, and they want the citizens
of other sections of the county to be in
d line with them and to have the same
j. advantages that they will have. For
a this purpose a meeting has been called
,a for next Saturday at Oakway at 2 o'clock
d p. m. The call will be found elsewhere
It in this issue. -
i Recently the Oconee-branch, National
d Rural Oredits association, was oigan
ized at Oakway, with $60,000 capital
if pledged, and in a very short while after
d the meeting $30,000 additional was sub
- scribed, with additional capital to come
a forward if needed. This shows interest
d and it shows confidence. But confidence
is not an essential feature in this finan
a cial undertaking, for the government of
is the United States is back of the greal
It new plan, known as the national rura,
a credits law, and there is no man foolisl
enough to be lacking in confidence ir
-y in our government or in the success 01
:e any financial efforts that our govern
at ment may make. All that is needed i
)e an understanding of the great new sys
tem of financing agricultural landowneri
?r at low interest rates and for long loat
a- periods, with the lands of the borrowei
or purchaser pledged as security for thi
loan.
The Oconee branch has elected officer

This organization was perfected or
August 19, and Oconee has gone on rec
ord as forming one of the first branchei
of the National Rural Credits associa
tion-new feature for our-eountry, bu
by no means a new plan. It has beei
worked in other countries for man;
years, and wherever it has been in usi
it has made farmers and agriculture
workers independent landowners. I
gives opportunity to every man to owl
his own farm by making the purchas,
terms so liberal and the interest rate s,
low that any man with a will can mak
good.
We believe that this National Rurv
Credits law is going to be the makinj
of the south. It presents the oppor
tunity that has long been needed to en
able the small farm renter to become
farm and home owner. We hope the
the people of Oconee are going to tak
to this plan and reap all the advantage
that it is designed to give.
The government can help you and I
is endeavoring to do so through th
- medium of the new rural credits systen
3 The government cannot, ani would n
i if it could, force you to take advantag
of it. That is up to the individual, an

dertaking pushed for all it is worth ar
s its advantages secured for our hon
farmers.
