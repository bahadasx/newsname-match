hall season Sunday afternoon with
the Navys of Toledo, and played a
scoreless game.
The Navys showed their

'a great hit.
The game was a see-saw affair
as the teams were evenly matched.
The visitors made heir gains on
short forward passes and line
plunges.
The locals' gains wore on long
'forward passes.
On November 12 the Navys will
bo back for another game.
Don't forget next Sunday's

The Classers lost their game to
the heavy ilaumec team at Mau

How Catarrh is Contracted.
Mothers are sometimes so thought
less as to neglect the colds which their
children contract. The inflammation
of the mucus membrane, at first acute,
becomes chronic and the child has
chronic catarrh, a disease that is sel
dom cured and that may prove a life's
burden. Many persons who have this
loathsome disease will remember hav
ing had frequent colds at the time it
was contracted. A little forethought,
a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy judiciously used, and all this trou
ble might have been avoided. Obtain
able everywhere.

Special correspondence to the
Journal from the New York Times
says :
Air. E. L. Blue, Journal, Perrysburg, O.
Dear Sir: Victor Carlstrom, the
aviator, is about to attempt a non
stop, sunrise to sunset, aeroplane flight
from Chicago to New York for the
New York Times, probably in the week
of October 10jl7. It is expected that
he will fly over or near your town.
Should he do so, will you kindly wire
"collect" at once a brief dispatch to
"The Times, New York," telling where
and at what time the machine passed,
and your estimate of its altitude and
speed ?
In the event of descent or accident,
please wire a full report.
Yours very truly,
C. V. VAN ANDA,
Managing Editor.
As the editor cannot keep his
eye on the heavens every moment
during the entire week, we will be
pleased to be called by phone by
any person who may observe the
daring aviator in the air above or
within sight of Perrysburg. Pos
sibly lie may pass over before this
paper reaches its readers.
RESIDENCE BURGLARIZED.
On Wednesday night last burg
lars entered the residence of Mr.
B. Trudeau and appropriated two
pocket books containing about
$35, and several other valuable
articles. They gained entrance
through a window. They were
frightened away by Mrs. Trudeau,
who was up stairs.

the door leading to the side porch
of their Front street residence they
discovered a man s clothing on the
porch. The wardrobe consisted of
a hat, coat, trousers and shoes. In
the clothing was an Ingersoll
watch, $1.35 in change and several
handkerchiefs.
Evidence that the man had gone
down the hill toward the river led
to the belief that he had committed
suicide. The river was dragged by
A. J. Wifzler and others but no
body was found.
Whether this fellow was an in

a fall donation to the preacher is
not known.

State of Ohio, County of Wood,
1th day of Oct. 1010.
The Republican party had nomi
nated Hon. Rutherford B. Ilaycs,
of Ohio, for president, and Hon.
William A. Wheeler, of New York.
for vice president, while the Dem
ocrats had nominated the Hon.
Samuel J. Tilden, of New York,
for president, and Hon. Thomas
A. Hendricks, of Indiana, for vice
president. The head of the Re
publican ticket had been a major
general in the Union army during
the war of the rebellion, and had
also served as governor of the
slate of Ohio. The head of the
Democratic ticket, while not hav
ing a military record, was well
and favorably known throughout
the Avhole of the United States, he
having served as governor of the
state of New York, and during his
term as such he had brought about
some great and much needed re
forms. The Democratic party
adapted for its slogan during this
campaign the phrase, "Tilden and
Reform," while the Republicans
had no campaign cry whatever, to
the best or my recollection. The
campaign was not at all spirited.
All of the excitement came after
the day of the election.
The electoi'al college at that
time consisted of 369 votes, 185 of
which were necessary to a choice
for president. On the face of the
returns the Democrats had carried
enough of the states to give them
a substantial majority of the elec
toral votes, but the Republicans
claimed there had been gross
frauds and intimidation in the
election in several of the southern
states. The controversy in regard
to the returns from these disputed
states was finally left for settle
ment to a commission appointed
for the occasion, called the elec
toral commission. This commis
sion was c.omposcd of five sena
tors, five members of the house of
representatives, and five justices
of the United States supreme
court Politically there were in
the commission eight Republicans
and seven Democrats, and in their
deliberations all of the matters in
dispute were decided in a very
partisan 8 to 7 manner, notably
in the case of Louisiana, where the
returning board had thrown out
several thousand Democratic bal
lots in order to make' it appear
that the Republican electors had
received a majority of the votes.
The other southern states, the re
turns from which were in dispute,
were South Carolina and Florida.
The electoral commission decided
that the Republican candidates

Tho reports of township asses
sors placed the wheat area in Ohio
sown for the harvest of 1916 at
1,586,962, hut owing to the severe
cold weather the latter part of
winter, a great deal of the wheat
sown was so badly killed as to
necessitate plowing up in the
spring to utilize the land for other
crops, especially was this true in
the northwest section of the state,
where 9,330 acres was reported as
plowed up.
It is true there was a short
acreage seeded as compared with
that seeded for last year's harvest,
but it is also true that there is a
shorter product per acre by 8
bushels. Last year we had n crop
of 36,030,238 bushels, nnd this
year we fall 17,125,560 bushels be
low the crop of last year. Crop of
1915 still in producers hands 13
per cent as compared with 9 per
cent one year ago.
Oats show a low production, due
to extreme dry weather. Harvest
being estimated at 42,090,019
bushels; this is approximately 13,
600,000 bushels less than 1915 pro
duction. Barley also shows a decrease in
estimated production per acre due
to dry weather being 28 bushels
as against 30 bushels in 1915. ,
