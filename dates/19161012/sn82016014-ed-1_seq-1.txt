Braves Field, Boston, Mass., Oct. 12.
The Boston Red Sox are the cham
pions of the oaseball world. They
perched themselves permanently on
the highest pinnacle of diamond fame
today by defeating the Brooklyn
Dodgers in the fifth game of the series
by the score of 4 to 1.
It was a battle for blood from the
start and both teams were on their
toes, if anything, a little bit too anx
iously. The boys from Brooklyn
opened the scoreboard in the first
half of the second inning when they
accomplished the difficult feat of reg-
istering a score without a hit. Cutshaw
looked over four bad ones and walked
to first. Hoblitzel pushed him along
with a sacrifice and Cutshaw scor
ed on a passed 'ball.
However, the Keantown battlers
were not long in tying the count. Lew
is the ever starring Duffy Lewis
gave one of Pleffer's offerings a ride
for three bases and scored only a few
minutes later on a sacrifice fly by

Cady and Hooper had the honor of
putting the coveted crown within the
grasp of their teammates in the last
of the third, while Ivy Olson, of the
Dodgers, became the goat of the se
ries. Cady singled and Hooper walk
ed. Olson fumbled Janvrin's grounder
and Cady scored while Hooper went all
the way to third. Shorten then came
thru with a cannon ball drive to cen
ter that counted Hooper.
Better pitching than Shore put on
display is rarely seen at a baseball ex
hibition. The North Carolinian was at
his best from the start, and up to the
fifth inning he was unhittable. The
first blow the Brooklyns registered
off him came when Meyers got an in
field single.
In the fifth round the Red Sox add
ed another counter to their string,
when Hooper singled and scored on
Janvrin's 2-ply blow. With the score
4 to 1 in Boston's favor It was con
ceded that the big series was over un

Pfeffer was taken out of the game
in the eighth inning to allow a pinch

went to the box for the Robins in the
last half of the inning. From the end
of the last half of the seventh inning
Brooklyn hopes began to die. and it
was conceded that Beanville would be
the home of the champions for an
other winter.

Situation Worse Than at Any
Time This Tear.
UTILITIES BODY SETS HEARING
Public Investigation of Lack of
Cars in State.
?feed of 4,000 Cars on Santa Fe
System Alone.
The car shortage "in Kansas and
other western states has reached what
is apparently a crisis. Freight offi
cials today admitted that the situa
tion is the worst that it has been this
year and is as bad as, if not worse,
than it has been at this period for
several years. Officials of the Santa
Fe said today that the road is short
1,000 or more of its own cars on its
western lines alone. The shortage of
domestic cars, on the entire Santa Fe
system, is estimated at 4,000. Other
Kansas roads report similar shortages,
some worse.
Thousands of western cars are be
ing held on roads east of Chicago.
The Remedy.
The prime factor in remedying the
shortage, however, officials point out,
would be for shippers to use greater
expedition in returning cars to rail
roads. Under demurrage laws, ship
pers are allowed to hold cars two
days on sidetrack at destination with
out charge. The fact that this is
done and the fact that shippers often
hold cars much longer at destination,
paying demurrage, and using the
rolling stock for storage purposes is
the big factor in the situation.
State's Hearing.
The Kansas Public Utilities commis
sion today set October 18 as the date
for the hearing of testimony in the
investigation of the car shortage in
the state. At this hearing the com
mission also will be called upon to
decide the reasonableness of demur- I
rage charges now assessed, where
cars are held and used for storage
purposes after the expiration of the
free time allowed.
A copy of the order for the hearing
has been sent to all common carriers
doing business in Kansas. All are re
quested to give testimony in the case.

Attended Marshall Meeting at
Auditorium Last Night.
Famous Wit and Educator
Came to Topeka in 1870.
John MacDonald, cne of the fore
most educators of Kansas and for
many years editor and owner of the
Western School Journal, was found
dead in bed this morning at his home.
827 Quincy street. He had been un
well several days, but last night at
tended the Marshall meeting at the
auditorium, returning to his room at
10 o'clock. When he did not go out to
breakfast this morning his friends be
came alarmed and broke in the door.
The body was cold when found.
Dr. W. L. Warriner and Dr. J. D.
Freeman were called and they notified
the coroner. Dr. O. F. Marcotte. Doc
tor Marcotte decided no inquest was
necessary and pronounced Mr. Mae
Donald's death duo to heart failure.
He died, according to the coroner,
about midnight.
Mr. MacDonald had lived in Topeka
forty-six years and nearly all of that
time had been engaged in educational
work. He lived twenty years at ths
home of Mrs. W. C. Webb, on Quincy
street. He was a member of the To
peka Press club and one of the found
ers of the Saturday Night club, an old
Topeka organization, of which he was
the first president.
Known Over United States.
Mr. MacDonald was well known, not
only in Kansas but thruout the United
States as an author, editor and humor
ist, and his Scottish dialect was fa
mous over the country. He made a
host of friends wherever he went and
none ever forgot the kind-hearted,
witty Scotchman.
Mr. MacDonald was a widower, and
his only relatives are a daughter and
a son, Roderick MacDonald, of Lowell.

will be announced after word is re

His IJfe Work. "'
The Celtic Monthly, published in
Glasgow, has the following to say of
Mr. MacDonald:
"John MacDonald was born at Lin-
shader, in the Lewis, a short distance
from the Standing Stones of Callernish
in the Parish of Uig. This is the land
of Sheila, the 'Princess of Thule," and
it may go without saying that when
Black's charming story reached the
prairies of Kansas, the Lewisman read
it as if it were a letter from home.
"When MacDonald was between 2
and 3 years old his parents removed
to the mainland, to Gareloch in Wes
ter Ross, and it was there that the
boy lived, moved and had his being for
a number of years. From his humble
home he could see every day the beau

Last Attempt to Smother Baby
With Her Clothes.
When the little child ran first to its
father then to its mother for protec

en Indians from the reservation, north
of town, tried for fifteen minutes to
day to kill their 3-year-old daughter.
It is thru no tenderness of heart on
the part of father or mother that the
child is alive.
The Indians came to Topeka last
night and no one knowa what the little
child passed thru during the night.
But early this morning the parents
and the child were seen near the
Shawnee mill on lower Kansas avenue.
The parents were taking turns slap
ping and kicking her. An Indian ar
rested later on another charge said
today that he stopped the parents once
when they were beating the child.
The man and woman continued to
drink and wandered on down Kansas
avenue, the child dodging blows as
they walked. It was directly in front
of the Davis Mercantile company that
the parents attempted to rid them
selves of the tagging child.
Eye witnesses say the father struck
at the child savagely and that it ran
to its mother for protection. The
mother struck it and pushed it away.

child ran from both parents. The

Then the mother stretched the child
out on the sidewalk and tried in her
drunken way to strike it with her heel.

father "Ftamped" it.
During all the time the parents were

tiysianaers discussed taking a hand
and eventually did. The child was
taken away from the parents and a
call was put in for the patrol wagon.
The drunken father and mother were
placed in jail. The child was exam
ined for broken oones but none was
found. It is badly bruised and there
is a cut under the chin where it was
kicked either by the father or mother.
The little child clung to the offi
cers when they rescued it and when
it reached the station and Harvey
Parsons, chief, spoke a few kind
words to it, the baby cuddled down
beside him and refused to move. He
remained with it waiting for the ma
tron to return until he was called to
district court as a witness. The baby
cried while he was gone, in spite of
the candy, gum and pennies lavished
upon it by officers.
Fears All Indians.
An Indian, not even an acquaintance
cf the little child, was brought in in
toxicated and the baby shrunk back
behind the chief. Not a word has it
said since it was brought to the sta
tion. It has uttered no complaint al
tho it must be suffering from its
many bruises. Its body was almost
stripped of clothing and the rags were
pinned up by officers.
Mrs. Skay, the mother, is said by
other Indians, to be a sister of Scott
Gabby, the Indian who was tried two
or three years ago for crushing his
own baby's head upon the sidewalk,
on lower Kansas avenue.
The Indians, the father and mother,
will be tried as soon as they sober up
sufficiently.

Attorney General Decides It Is
Against the Law.
DESTROY 2,550 GALLONS WINE
Product of Luscious Grapes
From Vineyard Is Lost.
Society Items in Newspapers
Nearly Brought to Light.
Society items appearing in Leaven
worth newspapers for years and In
volving the elite of Topeka, Lawrence,
Atchison, Leavenworth and the two
Kansas Citys came near playing a
prominent part in testimony produced
in Leavenworth county's district court
this week in a case brought by Assist
ant Attorney General F. P. Lindsay, in
which he won, and closed probably
the last existing liquor producing
plant in Kansas. Mr. Lindsey admits
that only the frantic -appeals of a good
looking, captivating society reporter
in Leavenworth kept him from prov
ing the existence or the notorious
Hurrle wine garden by using the so
ciety clippings she has been writing;
for the last 'steen years.
Enough grief has been produced in
the state's action to close the Hurrle
winery. F. G. Hurrle, according to
his attorney, will be near a bankrupt
when the Leavenworth district court's
order is carried out and 2,550 gallons
of wine manufactured by Hurrle, from
grapes in his own vineyard, are de
stroyed. The value of this wine esti
mated by the attorney general's office
will aggregate $5,000.
Wife Died of Grief.
"Nor is this all," said Lindsay. "I
understand that since we raided th3
exclusive wine garden at Leavenworth,
October 5, 1915, Hurrle's wife ha
died, the result of grief and worry over
the affair."
Hurrle, a handsome native-born
Italian of unusual appearance is now
in charge of a dining room in a Leav
enworth hotel. Most Italians are dark
haired and dark ey3d. Hurrle is a
blonde with long curly hair and a
long, wavy blonde beard extending far
down on his shirt front.
Wow! "A ifight at Hurrle's."
For years a "night at Hurrle's" was
a night of joy for society people from
all cities in the vicinity of Leaven
worth. Acre upon acre of grapes
were grown by Hurrle on his place on
the outskirts of Leavenworth. These
grapes were used in making wine of
a quality hardly surpassable.
Hurrle's wine garden was open to
high and low. There army officers
danced and sang with the girls from
Leavenworth and other cities.
Wealthy people from Topeka jour
neyed there and enjoyed a "night at
Hurrlo's." And Leavenworth clerka
I and mechanics were welcome, too. Ha
always maintained order and yet he
permitted a good time. His home
held a dance hall and a dining hall.
The cooking done by his wife was
superb.
"Tuas a Society Affair.
The papers of Leavenworth looked
upon a night at Hurrle's as a society
affair. Time after time an item of
this character has appeared:
"Mr and Mrs. of Topeka,
entertained a number of friends at
Hurrie s place last evening."
When Hurrle was finally raided
Leavenworth threw up her hands in
horror.
"Would the Drohihitionintu ffnm Tn-
I peka dare put their hands on Hurrle's
paironizea Dy tne people of Topeka
themselves?" they asked.
Hurrle Must Pay a Fine.
The attorney general did and won
in a hard fight in the district cnurt
. Hurrle must pay a fine, must pay the
' court costs and has a Jail sentence
I to his credit and the wine must be
i destroyed. Personal calls have been
j made upon Attorney General Brewster
, by Hurrle's attorney to get permission
for Hurrle to keep a part of the wine,
which, it is claimed, has turned to
vinegar since the raid was made in
j October, 1915.
The persons mentioned In society
t items would have been called in as
witnesses to prove sales, Lindsay said.
