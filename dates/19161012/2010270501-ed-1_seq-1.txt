PLASTER CEILING FALLS
AT BURLINGTON DEPOT
Tuesday at 1 o'clock, a large quan
tity of the heavy planter ceiling on
the porch on the south side of the
Burlington station fell with a tre
mendous crash. The apace which
was covered by the fallen ceiling
probably la ten by thirty feet In size.
Fortunately no one was standing
In the space below. The weig-ht of
the plaster is great and It would have
been a serious matter had any per
son been standing so as to get the
force of the falling debris.
Other strips of the ceiling hang
about ready to fall, and it Is evident
the company will have to put in a
steel ceiling, or something of the
kind, If they desire to have a celling
permanent and safe.
SECRETARY FILES REPORT
OF CO. FAIR CONDITION
Figure Knowing lleceipt ami Ex
penditure Directors Request
All Deficit Tald in Full
H. M. Bushnell, Jr., assistant sec
retary of the Box Butte Fair asso
ciation, has made a complete report
to the directors and stockholders of
the association regarding the condi
tion for the ytar 1916.
lUport of II. .M. liusliiicll, Jr.
To the Board of Directors of the
abeve-named organization :
In opening this report, the writer
desires to thank the Board of Direct
ors and the numerous individual
members who have aided in the hold
ing of a quasi successful fair for the
year 1916. It will not be amiss to
recall some of the hardships which
attended the holding of a fair this
year. To begin with, it had been
some four years since a fair was
held, and undoubtedly it was a great
detriment to the present fair, be
cause of the lack of appreciation
which people had for such a celebra
tion. Further, the present organiz
ation was late in commencing work
upon the fair, and the dates set for
the fair were far from propitious or
desirable.
Notwithstanding the handicaps
enumerated above, the Fair Board
have proven by this fair that a fair
can be successfully and profitably
staged in Box Butte county at times
in the future. It is universally rec
ognized that had not inclement, in
fact deplorable, weather visited Alli
ance on the three days of the fair
that it would have been a greater and
more profitable fair, and would have
undoubtedly paid nil Its expenses in
their entirety. Ti e r port of re
ceipts and expenditures shov that
the Fair association th year -working
under the adverse circumstances
that It did. incurred a loss of less
than 400, all of which is taken up
by premium expenditures.
It is the belief of your cis'.ttani
secretary that fifty per cent of that
amount will bt donated back to the
association, and material!) reduce
the financial loss that will be noted
In this report: that there has been
placed upon the grounds no small
amount of permanent improvements
which will add value to the property
and be a valuable asset to the asso
ciation. Taken all in all we believe
that the fair of 1916 can be consid
ered and was a success and it is the
hope of all that the Fair association
will see tit to stage a regular fair in
the future.
In closing, your assistant secre
tary desires to re-expies his thanks
for the co-operation accorded him in
the work, especially to the Board of
Directors, to the local newspaper
men, to the Commercial club mem
bers and to all who contributed to
the success of the fair. The lit-' tf
receipts and expenditures is uyi tid

MARKET NKWS HKKV1CK
ADVANCES POTATOES 10c
Within a week after the market
news service, which furnishes free
buleltins daily on potato quotations
in all the principal markets, was In
tailed at Alliance, potatoes advanc
ed 10 cents In western Nebraska de
spite a decline in the central mar
kets. On September 20, the day before
the Otllce of Markets of the U. S. de
partment of agriculture in conjunc
tion with the Kxtension Service of
the University of Nebraska and the
county agents, opened an otlice at
Alliance, buyers were paying 60
cents per bushel for ungraded stock
delivered in bulk to cars at Heming
ford. Within a week the price ad
vanced to 70 cents for the same qual
ity of potatoes and as hih as 7 5
cents was being paid for the best.
Meantime,, however, potato markets
like Kansas City were suffering a
downward trend. This indicates that
tho the consumer was paying less for
his potatoes, the farmer was getting
more because he had become ac
quainted with the high prices being
paid in the city market thru the me
dium of the market service bulletin.
Inasmuch as western Nebraska
will ship something like a million
bushels of potatoes this year, this in
crease in the price of potatoes means
an increase of $100,000 for western
Nebraska farmers.
The market news service will un
doubtedly eliminate the speculative
element In potato buying and yet al
low the dealer a fair margin of prof
It. In past years the farmer has
generally been In touch with the
price of grain and live stock, but has
always been in the dark as to the
condition of potato markets. The
market ut-ws service places the fol
lowing information before the farm
ers as well ps the dealers: Shipping
poll t hfyi'iK prices at Nebraska
poin's and other centers of produc
tion; me prevailing jobbing prices
in the markeis receiving Nebraska
poiatcos. as v.-ell as the co-idition of
the stuck and quantity arriving,
nuivber of cars held on track and up
loaded. Vhe nu:i ber of curs shipped
from other states Is also rhown and
this information i np-to-the-i linutf ,
being telegraphed (I'rect to the Alli
ance otllre each tiny. Another fea
ture i f this report .s thai part show
ing the destination of all cars of Ne
braska potatoes shipped the previous
day. This is of great value to the
dealers as It prevents the glutting of
any one market.
When the first report was issued
from the Alliance otlice an explana
tory sheet was enclosed which ex
plained to the farmer how to use the
report to good advantage, suggesting
that he call on his local freight agent
to get the freight rates to the various
markets and calling attention to the
.-'anger of shipping immature pota
toes too far. It was suggested also
th;" ihe farmer i;!v.ays consider the
quality and condi'ion when placing a
vclue on hiy crop. The buyer, being
a ntcest-ary h cti.r in the marketing
of tli-i crop, should be allowed a rea
sonable margin to cover shrinkage
and pre tit.
The office now mails out about
1600 report i eai h day on the noon
t.aiiid which make good conenctions
with all Nebraska shipping sections,
an 1 the mailing list covert practical
ly all pole to giowers ana dealers in
western Nebraska.

CiincJrun to Mr. tYile on Shares
Lincoln. If the state of Nebraska
ever becomes a little old "Coal Oil
Johnny" or a rival of Rockefeller ev
ery user of an automobile or fuel oil
engine will be able to point back to
Saturday, October 7, 1916, the sec
ond day after President Wilson ap
peared in Nebraska, when Governor
John II. Morehead, Attorney General
Willis K. Reed, State Treasurer G. E.
Hall and Deputy State Land Commis
sioner George E. Emery Eat at the
governor's table and, law or no law,
authorizing them to do so, entered
into a contract on behalf of the state
as party of the first part, with Ed
win E. Crites of Chadron, party of
the second part, whereby the party
of the drat part agreed to accept as
royalty one-tenth of all the petrole
um the party of the second part digs
out of a certain half-section of state
la;id belonging to the state of Ne
braska, situated twenty miles north
of Chad ron, and two miles from the
South Dakota state line, the paid
land being described as follows: San
dy ami not worth a tinker, except for
grazing purposes, said contract to be
binding upon both parties for a peri
od of live years from date.
It is now up to Mr. Crites to bore
for oil and the state to wait for Us
royalties during the next five years.
Mr. Criics says he will do that same
at once, and he proposes to go at
least flftee nhundred feet in the di
rection the east wing of the state
house is sinking, which is downward
at the rate of a quarter of an Inch
every thirteen years. Mr. Crites ex
pects to beat this record for speed.
He owns a section of land in his own
name, holds another section under
lease and already holds the half-section
of state land in question under
lease and on top of this now has a
leHne to bore for oil and pay the
state one-tenth of all the oil he finds.

colects taxes, issues notary public
commissions, tries to make railroad
rates in competition with interstate
commerce rates, creates senators and
congressmen, makes hog cholera se
rum, cares for the feebleminded and
also for successful otlice hunters,
owns and controls water In streams
and the fishes therein, also the birds
of the air, furnishes homes for
homeless children and makes
straight halt and crippled children
and enforces the early closing law
except In Omaha, but the state Is not
specifically authorized by tonstilu
tion or law to engage In Ihe water
power business or coul oil business.
The state oflicers who met Satur
day are members of the board of ed
; ucatlonal lands and funds. As they
i have been authorized by the consti
tution to have general management
, of all lands and funds set apart for
educational purjioses, they believe
they have power to lease oil rights
to the half-section 'now held by Mr.
Crites, It being state school land.
Texas and Oklahoma lease such
rights to land known to contain val
uable oil and get' In return one
eighth, whereas the Nebraska board
will get one-tenth, rovlding there is
. any oil.
i Under the old lease to bis half
section held by Mr. Crites, he Is pay
ing the state $24 n year, or 7 rents
an acre rental. It was appraised in
1908 at a value of $400 for leasing
purposes. It was recently appraised
by the Dawes county board at $5 an
acre for sale purposes. The lease
held by Mr. Crites is one of the few
old ones subject to be converted into
a sale contract. If there is oil on
the land the state board does not
care to sell. Under the constitution
the land could not be sold for less
than $7 an acre. It is now worth
less, but if it contains oil it is worth
.a large .sum. Rather than try to
purchase, on its speculative value Mr.
Crites prefers to make a new lease
whereby he will continue to pay 7
cents an acre rental and in addition
pay a royalty to the state on all oil
discovered during the next five years.
For 6ome reason oil excitement
had been stirred up In the north
western corner of the state. John
L. McCaEue of Omaha has obtained
leases to several tracts not owned by
the Mate. People living at Rapid
City have done likewise in Nebraska
i:iul across the state line In South
Dakota.
Mr. Crites said a well was sunk
fourteen years ago to a depth of 1,
000 feet, but no oil was found. Ge
ologists have given some encourage
ment to prospectors and they pro
pose to try again. It is reported that
prospecting has been going on for
some time.

FIRST LADY HAS A
IMU'III.F. IN OMAHA
Mrs. Woodrow Wilaon Is said to
have a double In Omaha in the per
son of Mrs. Doiu-laa B. Welpton. well
know n sine- r an dteacher.
Score.-, of persons are commenting
upon till' r.omblancc between these
two women. Thiy analyze the two
faces ai.d find that the individual
features have a startling similarity.
Mrs. WilKon has an ov:;l face and
so has Mrs. Welpton, with the s:ime
delicate curving che k line; Mrs.
Wilson is blessed with a beautiful
aquiline nose, and nature has been
equally kind to Mra. Welpton in the
matter of noses: both have deep blue
eyes, heavily lashed; their mouths
are shaped alike, and friends declare
they find a resemblance even in their
strong white teeth and smiles.
At first Mrs. Welpton laughed
about the affair, but it has been so
persistently called to her mind that
she can no longer entirely overlook
it.
The morning after the parade sev
eral of her pupils came to her home,
!i:hisiin' tlial tdio might pass for a
sister of the president's wife.
At th1 ball Friday night, numer
ous persons remarked upon the re
semblance, and at the dinner wM-h
followed at the Omaha club the dis
cussion of the likeness caused con
siderable merriment. Friends face

U. S. WILL NOT. BAR
GERMAN SUBMARINES
.Washington. Developments here
yesterday Indicated that the United
States is making plans to meet any
Issues which may arise with cither
Germany or the allies over the oper
ations of German submarines on this
side of the Atlantic.
While Secretary of State Lansing
was at Shadow Lawn conferring with
President Wilson, officials of the
state and navy departments were
busy collecting all evidence concern
ing the activities of the U-53 off the
New England coasts Sunday and yes
terday. Also the state department,
acting on orders from President
Wilson, made public tho American
reply to tho British note of Aug. 22
demanding the United States agree
to refuse harborage to belligerent
submarines during the remainder of
the war.
In her note, Great Britain Intimat
ed that unless this country agreed to
follow her suggestions. American
submarines might be endangered la
case the undersea warfare was car
ried to waters off American shores.
The United States refused the dj
mand pnintblank and served notices
on Great Britain and her allies that
It would hold the "negligent power"
responsible for any injury done
American subjects, where no attempt
had been made to ascertain their na
tionality. The American reply was sent on
Aug. 31, and was extremely curt.
It was minus the usual diplomat
ic frills and indicated that this gov
ernment did not care to carry on the
controversy further. It was with
held from the press until yesterday,
on the president's order.
Insofar as the possible differences
with Germany are concerned, Wash
ington officials said that everything
depends on the conferences which
are being held at Shadow I.iwn be
tween President Wilson and Secre
tary of State (rinsing and tbe presi
dent and Ambassador Girard.
Further reports from the New
England coast and from survivors of
the vessels torpedoed by tho U-53 in
dicated that there might have been
a serious loss of life had not Amer
ican torpedo boats gone to the rescue
of the passengers of the tSepbano
when she was torpedoed.
Officials pointed out that the Unit
ed States never has formally conced
ed that putting passengers In open
boats at sea was sufficient for their
safety.
The president, in view of this, may
feel called upon to reopen that par
ticular nhase of the submarine con
troversy dealing with the treatment
of nonc(.mb:itants.
Absolutely no intimation came
from Shidow Lawn, however, to In
dicate along what lines the president
is thinking.
The view taken here is that the
U-53 observed the German promises,
iird, ps no lives were lost, there
seemed little ground for a proteat
now.
S-iv t'livih, Ga. The presence of a
submarine of undetermined national
ity off T.vb-v bar, off Savannah Tues
day was reported to local customn
bouse officials and to the British
consul hMe. it was learned tonight.
Officials, at both the customshouse
and consulate refused to say where
their information came from, but
each emphasized the statement that
It was '-entirely unofficial." No Am
erican undersea boats are believed to
be in these waters.

Mrs. Osgood Eastman and Mrs.
William Sl urs Poppleton are two of
the many Omaha women who are
most insistent about this resem
blance. Elwin Law, Chicago, a friend of
Mr. Welpton, who met Mrs. Welpton
for the first time Friday, stared at
her for a moment and exclaimed:
"Now, I know whom you look like.
It's Mrs. Wilson."
