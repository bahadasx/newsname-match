Dear Otis:
I am not going to be quite as
slow in sending you check as
you were in sending statement.
I wrote you when I first came
up here to send me statement. I
am also sending $1.50 for the
Herald another year. I could
have taken advantage of the 1.00
a year, but it is worth SI. 50.
I have been sick nearly ever
since I came up here, but am
feeling better now. I have a run
between here and Crystal City.
Mrs. Chas. Finnegan is visit
ing us. She has just returned
from a visit to her sister at
Louisiana, Mo. Charley is con
ductor on a work train out of

With best wishes to you, the
Herald and Woodrow Wilson.

Stubblefield Sues County.
Caruthersville, Mo., Oct. 5.
Mack Stubblefield, sheriff, has
filed a suit against Pemiscot
county for ?7,500, which he al
leges to be due him on county
warrants for the years l'Jii,
1910 and 1916. In his petition?
he says these warrants, 10 "in
number, were issued to him' for
the care of county prisoners as
jailer, all except two small ones.
For several years Pemiscot
county has been in financial dis
tress. In April, 1913, auditors
reported that the sum of $14,800
was due the county from various
officials, and of this amount
$7,000 was paid into the treasury,
the remainder being lost after
being in court some years. On
the heels of this report came the
crash of the Pemiscot County
Bank in July, 1913, in which the
county lost approximately $450,-
000, only a small part of which
has been since repaid. All these
facts and circumstances have
badly hurt the finances of the
county, and it is estimated that
there are now outstanding and
unpaid warrants to the total of
nearly $40,000. The members of
the county court have suggested
a bond issue to relieve the condi
tion, but it is very doubtful if
such would be endorsed bv the
npnni . o nrn in thp mm.
time it is probable other suits
may be tiled against the county
by persons who hold warrants.

Quite a bunch of good Demo

Miss Lambert was called to
Benton Tuesday on account of
the serious illness of her father.
Friday afternoon of this week
at 2 o'clock Kennett High School
boys will be here for a football
game with our boys. The teams
are rather well matched in size
and the people of Hayti can ex
pect to see a good game. The
boys need the encouragement
that comes from the presence of
a good crowd, so come out to the
ball park and root for the home
team.
A School" Orchestra is being
organized this week. Mrs. Guffy
will have charge of the work and
we feel certain that in the coarse
of a few weeks she will be ready
to render some good music. We
need a greater interest in music.
Let's encourage this effort.
New orders for penmanship
books have been placed. More
and better penmanship will be
done when our new supply of
of books arrive.
Supplies for a card charging
