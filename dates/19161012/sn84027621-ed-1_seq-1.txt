PROMlllEflT DEMOCRATS
RALLY TO PARTY
Cattsites Falsify Both Law and Evi
dence in Attempting to Bolster
Up Their Claims ;
(Special to the Star)
Jacksonville, Oct. 12 -Speakers
from all sections of Florida are rap
idly volunteering their services- to the
democratic committee. Amos Lewis of
Jackson county has volunteered to
take the stump, and it is stated that
he will challege'his brother, Hayes
Lewis, "collector of internal revenue,
and an ardent Catts supporter' to
meet him in debate.
Both of the Lewises are good cam
paign speakers and ifthey should de
cide to make a stumping tour of the
state, it would add zest to the cam
paign and would furnish a day that
would long be remembered in thepo
litical annals of the state.
There appeared here in Jacksonville
a new line of campaign literature is
sued by Catts which attempts to prove
that the supreme court was biased
and that it would not grant a writ of
mandamus to have the 69 votes of
Alachua county counted, which is con
tended in this literature, would make
Catts the nominee. He disregards and
makes no mention of the fact that if
the 123 votes Mr. Knott has certified
in Tallahassee that nave not been
counted were to-be - considered that
Mr. Knott would still be .entitled to
retain the certificate for 41 votes. .
The literature and circulars are
ooked upon by observing politicians
here in Jacksonville as being a clumsy
attempt to deceive people into believ
ing that if these 69 votes had been
counted Catts would have been the
nominee.
Records on file in the office of the
secretary of state show that Catts
has never been entitled to the nomi
nation since September 21st. Mr.
Knott has had at all times more votes
in the office of the secretary of state
than Catts. ;
Counsel for Mr. Knott applied to
the supreme court October 3rd for a
writ of mandamus to recanvass all
amended returns 'from all counties,
including Alachua and the 69 votes
Catts is making so much fuss about,
to be canvassed along with all others.
The supreme court denied Mr.
Knott's application on the grounds
that to canvass the votes then on file
.would not change the result and that
it was an unnecessary proceeding
and could result in no relief or benefit
to Mr. Knott ."- .
Mr. Catts' attorneys at the same
time attempted to have the 69 votes
of Mr. Catts counted and attempted
to have the supreme court order that
certain Catts returns be counted and
that all others be disregarded. Mr.
Flournoy, chief counsel for Mr. Catts,
has been appealing to the court daily
for this unfair advantage until Tues
day, when the court adjourned for j
vacation until the 17th of October.

AUTO ACCIDENT
Fatal Result Narrowly Escaped
by
Stein and Fauth
Yesterday afternoon about 1 o'clock
Mr. Harry Stein and . Mr. Fauth of
the Theus Furniture company had a
narrow escape from serious injury
when the auto truck which the former
was driving turned turtle on the pub
lic road about a mile west of Lees-
burg. -Both were pinned to the
ground under the car, and but for the
fact that they had picked up a color
ed man at Whitney who was riding in
tne, rear oi tne macnine - and was
thrown clear of the wreck, and pried
it off of them, they would probably
have suffered seriously if not fatally.
They were taken to Leesburg, and
after being attended to by a physician
secured an auto and caught the Sea
board limited for Ocala. Mr. Fauth
received a number of wounds' about
the head and face, and had his knee
badly , injured, while Mr. Stein escap
ed with only a few bruises about the
legs, where a portion of the car rest-
e dafter turniner over on him.
The accident was caused by the
breaking of the left-hand radius rod.
Everything considered, the occupants
of the car are to be congratulated on
their escape from serious injury.

TROUBLE llll THE
DISPOSAL Willi
Of Ocala's Worries With Her Im
v provements, there Seems
to be No End -
It seems like Ocala has more than
the usual share of trouble with her
few hundred thousand ; dollars of im
provements. : V
The latest worry is with the tank
for the ultimate disposal of the sew
age, it is located m the lowest place
in the city, and after draining the
solid matter out of the sewage is sup
posed to discharge the fluid through
wen into tne underground ; river
that the government eeoloerists say
traverses this section between Silver
Springs and Blue Springs. The tank
is of cement braced with steel It was
built on top of the ground, and look
ed like a small jaiL Then it was low
ered into place by digging out the
ground: under and in it, as the curb
ing is sunk in a well. When it had
reached almost the required depth.
he diggers struck one of the cavities
that abound in this section. This was
covered with a heavy floor of cement,
and everything was believed to be all
right.
The cement must have cracked,
however, for when the time came to
use the tank, and it was tested by be
ing filled with water, the water soon
ran out. It was re-filled, two or three
times, but with the same result.
rresiaent xsasn notinea tne con
tractors, also Twombly & Henney of
the trouble. Bryan & Co. sent a man
here, and after taking a look at the
lank he returned to make a report to
bis" employers. Bryan & v ; Co. , have
written that they are willing to stop
any excessive leakage in. the tank un
aer operating conditions, rney , say,
however, that they believe ; that as
soon as a hundred or more houses are
connected to the sewerage system, the
leakage will automatically take up to
a reasonable amount. At" present only
half a dozen houses have been con
nected.
The tank .now looks like one of
those German subterranean defenses
off of which a British shell has blown
the lid.
CHANGE IN TEXAS OIL AGENCY
Mr. Eugene E. Dobbs has resigned
as Ocala representative of the Texas
Oil company, in which capacity he has
been acting for the past year. Mr. J.
T. Jones, who for a number of years
has had charge of the Standard plant
here, succeeds Mr. Dobbs.
Mr. R. W. Crenshaw, traveling
salesman of the Texas, whose head
quarters are in Tallahassee, is here
ior a snort time to assist tne new
agent in covering the territory. Mr.
Jones has been connected with the ol
business in Ocala for so long that he
has earned the nickname of "Stand
ard Oil" Jones, so his friends wil
now- probably dub him "Texas."
The city supply station will 'con
tinue to be located at the Dobbs gar
age on North Magnolia street. . -

Laredo, Tex., Oct. 8. The Second

of train service, being provided with
Pullmans all the way. . Lieut. Will of
Co. D, head of the regimental can
teen, saw that the boys had what they
wanted in smokes and soft drinks,
while Charlie Rodoff the "crab man"
served "hot dog." We were on the
road three days and four nights.
As the boys were fortunate in get
ting paid off at Black Point, the mo-
notony of the ; journey was broken
with the always favorite game of
craps and penny ante. v
The only state we passed through of
commendable interest was Louisiana,
which can truly be said to be a state
of molasses and rice. If we passed
one -mile of sugar cane, we passed
through fifty. All plantations seemed
to have their own refineries.
We were granted the privilege of
seeing San Antonio, and visiting the
Alamo and other points of interest.
Our camp, is situated about fifteen
minutes walk from the heart of
Laredo, which is a town of about 20,-
000 population. Soldier life is much
better here than in the mobilization
camps as the boys have the privilege
of going to town any time when not
on duty. Reveille is at 5:45, retreat
at 6:45 and taps at 1 o'clock.
The boys that wear the khaki are
well looked after here. There is an
open air picture show, a Y. M. C. A.
building large enough to accommo
date all who wish to write, also a
piano and plenty of good music for
hose so enclined, and there are some
'artists," both vocal and instrumen
