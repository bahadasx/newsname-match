Secretary Lansing last night after

Although the secretary declined to

officers Indicated that much would
depend upon Hear Admiral Knight's
forthcoming report on all the naval
phases of tb raid, particularly the

Idea of making a definite decision.

would remain undetermined until a

hasty or lll-advlsed decision in so
Important a matter.
Whether the German ambassador
took proper care for the safety of
the persons he put into small boats
from the attacked veBHels is a ques
tion Involving points on which offi
cials believe there is no clear prece
dent, and on which a decision by the
United States might approximate a
precedent, at least so far as concerns
any further submarine operations
Germany may "contemplate on this
side of the Atlantic.
Before any policy Is determined
upon, it is expected that the opinion
of the neutrality board, created at the
beginning of the war to advise the
state department in regard to such
questions, will be consulted.
The board was called Into session
immediately after the U boat ap
peared on this aide of the Atlantic
and several meetings have been held
since. Any decision it renders will
be submitted to Secretary Lansing,
but will not be binding. Much sig
nificance is attached to the nndingB
of this board, which in the Appam
case, for instance, laid down the
policy approved, by the department
and upheld in the courts.
Considerable interest centers on
the continued ailence of the ailled
embassies. Again it was stated posi
tively at the state department that
no representations of any sort had
been received from the allies as a
result of the U-63 depredations off
the American coast.

Rear Admiral Knight, in command

Submarine tender.
"I cannot answer that," the ad

report of submarine bases or tenders
pass by without investigation."

each ship in activity command has
virtually a full complement alwaya

as they . were Sunday, when several

sunk during the outburst of German
