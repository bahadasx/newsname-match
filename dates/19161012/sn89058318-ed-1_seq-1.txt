The jury reported at nine o'clock
that they could not agree on a
verdict, and again at ten thirty
that they could not agree. The
Court was not willing to dis
charge , them, and they were
asked to consider theca.se further,
and attorneys for the State and
the defense both asked the jur
ors to reason together in an eilort
to reach a verdict if possible.
At eleven o'clock the jury sent
for the Court and linnounced
that they found the defendant
"not guilty," . Thereupon, the
jury requested the defendant to
remain in the court room, and
some of the members of the jury
proceeded to '"'lecture" the de
fendant and this was kept up
for some time. The next morn
itjg.a.number ofhe jurors were
around shaking hands with the
attorneys connected with the
case, and stated that while they
believed the evidence of Fred
Abraham to be true, yet some

side of the building from where
Abraham saw Clyde, and for this
reason they could not agree on a
verdict of guilty, and Clyde be
ing young they felt like giving
him another chance anyway.

term of the Court and resulted
in a mistrial, ten of the jury be
ing for conviction and one for
acquital, the other juror having
been excused on account of sick
in his family. '

Tuesday -evening when - the sud
den and unexpected death of At
torney W. II. Hantffton was an
nounced. Mr. ' Hampton had
been down town rndngling with
his friends in apparently good
'health and spirits' and had re
turned home somewhat fatigued.
A short time later he was found
dying in his chair.
Mr. Hampton had been a prac-
' titioner at the Grundy County
bar for many years and was
known as one of the best land
lawyers in the county.
He was born in 1812 near Al
tamont in this county. His first
wife was Miss Nellie Freeman
from whom he was seperated
shortly after they were married.
He then married 'Miss Libby
Smith of Altamont. To them
were born five- boys and four
girls. After the death of the
mother of these children, he
married Miss Dutton, who nobly
assisted him in raising his large
family of children,
Besides the w-idow the follow
ing children survive1 and mourn
his loss. Messers Smart Hamp
