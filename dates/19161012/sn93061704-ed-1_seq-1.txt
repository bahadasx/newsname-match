output to a car per day. They expect
to install machinery ere long.
The law suit involving title to the
Blue Star Mining claim has been deci

another car of ore from the leased
property of Mr. Pohl. The Camerons

SOLICITING BEANS TOR
BENEVOLFNT INSTITUTIONS
Can Make Use of Deans in
Lieu of Money
Rev. R. E. Farley, local pastor of
the Methodist Episcopal Church, has
arranged for a Bean Honor Roll. The
Methodist Church maintains a Theologi
cal and Industrial School for Spanish
ipeaking boys at Albuquerque, The
Harwood Industrial School for Girls at
Albuquerque, The Methodist Deaconess
Hospital at Albuquerque, and the Na
tional Methodist Sanatarium at Silver
City. It also lends its support to the
New Mexico Children's Home at Albu
querque. The pastor has arranged that
the local church will receive credit on
Benevolences for gifts of various sorts
to these institutions, and has asked
any who can do so to make donations
of beans or other articles for any of
these institutions. He has pledges thus
far of eight hundred pounds of beans.
Any who have not as yet made a dona
tion, and desire to do so, should see
Mr. Farley at once.
Gifts of this kind will be as accepta
ble as the cash, and can be made much
more readily and easily by the donors.
Public School Honor Roll

air Schools. The pupils, whose names

Quivira property, with a view of fen

HIGH SCHOOL REVIEWS
PREPARING FOR EXAMS
Patrons Should Encourage Stu
dents and Teachers by Vis
iting School
The second month of school opened
on Monday with a twenty-four hour
rainfall. Rain began to fall early on
Monday and continued steadily until
about the same hour on Tuesday. The
total rainfall measured about 2 inches.
We feel that the rain did the bean
harvesters more harm than the schools
for the attendance was very good con
sidering the inclemency of the weather.
School adjourned on Thursday and
Friday of last week to allow the pupils
to attend the county fairs at Willard
and Estancia. It is estimated that
more than 30 per cent, of the school
children and at least a hundred of the
citizens of the Mountainair district at
tended these fairs.
The school officials believe that to
boost the interests of Torrance Connty
will be a boost for Mountainair and,
desiring a closer relationship with our
sister districts, thought it wise to allow
the two days vacation,
The report cards are out and we again
call your attention to the standing of
your child and if it is not satisfactory
the teachers would be glad for your co
operation. The "Honor Roll" is already excit
ing much interest and we believe it
will be a very far-reaching incentive for
punctuality and regular attendance.
Those who are neither absent nor
tardv during the year will receive
special mention at the close of school.
Next week will end the first period
of the first semester of the High School.
Rev iews have already begun and it is
necessary that you be in attendance
every day so that you may check up
and fix what you have already learned.
These reviews will be followed by the
regular "exams" and your showing
from time to tme wjl determine
whether you will receive the credits
the school offers.
Let us insist upon visitors. If you
visit the schools, the teachers and pu
pils feel that you are interested in them
and it will be an incentive for better
and more careful work. If you visit
the bchoulá and are pleased, knock at
every door and tell them about it. If
you are not pleased, don't knock.
Candidates Arrive late
Last Saturday, it was announced on
the street that ILL. Hall, candidate for
state treasurer on the democratic tick
et and J. B. Larrazolo, would address
the people of this vie' y at or about
noon. But noon came without the
speakers and when they arrived, it was
decided that as hc farmers were so
busy trading and the towns people so
busy waiting on them, that the meet
ing was called off.
Col. William M. Berger, of Belen,
came over to hold a republican meet
ing, following that of the democrats.
When the democratic speakers failed
to show up, the Colonel proceeded to
the schoolhouse where he addressed an
audience of about a dozen.
Our people would rather sell beans
than talk politics any day.
Sunday Services
Rev. R. E. Farley will preach at the
Methodist Church next Sunday at 11
a. m. Sunday School at 10 a. m. ; Ep
worth League at 7:00 p. m. All are
cordially invited to these services.
, The Epworth League topic is VM
8a Among the Women of India."

38000 Pounds Beans
From 37 acres
E. C. Sharpless was in Mountainair
last Saturday from his farm ten miles
north, bringing in a half dozen loads of
beans, which he sold to W. F. Martin.
He threshed something over 38,000
pounds from about 37 acres. He is get
ting too big to drive to town with a
team any more, but came in in the new
style Ford, which is one of the results
of his bean crop, leaving the freighters
to bring the beans. He declares the
good lady and himaelf are getting far
enough along in years to begin to play
a little and thinks the Ford a good
plaything. He ordered the Indepen
dent sent to his address and also to E.
F. Sharpleas, Chicago Junction, Ohio.
Mr. Sharpless brought in eight loads
more of hi bean on Monday of this

the Santa Fe has granted a rate of one
fare for the round trip to those who at
tend the meeting in garita Fe next
month, gelling dates will be from
November 23 to 27, with final return
limit of December 5th. This ia the
first time so low a rate has ever been
granted for this purpose and augurs
well for the attendance which promises
to tax the limits of Santa Fe, to house
and care for the large delegation.
Wet Weather
The beautiful fall weather which we
have been enjoying for some time past,
was replaced last Friday by several
good showers. Monday of this week
proved a rainy day, with showers al
most all of Monday night. Tuesday
was cloudy and misting a portion of the
day.
The moisture will put the soil in
spjendjd shape for fall plowing, the
rain having fallen slowly and all being
absorbed as it fell.
