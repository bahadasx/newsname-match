bley's winter supply. Well, I seec
Craig leave his boss at the barn an'
walk across his field to whar Abe Ful
ton was matin' a wire fence fer 'im.
The truth is, I tuck no particular no
tice of 'em, an' the distance was so
great that I couldn't see the'r faces
good nor hear wliat was said, but
somehow it struck me at the time that
they was havin' words.
"Whether it was the'r motions or
looks or what not I don't know, but,
anyways, I remem' er that the fust
thought that popped into my head aft
er Craig's inixu'p with Howard was
that Craig had quarreled with Abe an'
that was one reason he was so ready
to pounce on somebody else. Hui I
didnt let the thing weigh much with
me at the time, fer, you sec, I was fol
lowin' the other scent, but after that
failed I tuck up the other an' tried to
see cf I could connect Abe with the
killin'."
An' did you—did you, that's the
question?" Abner's lower lip was quiv
ering under tense suspense. Ilis bushy
brows had met.
"I don't know, Uncle Ab; as God is
my final judge, I don't," Pole return
ed, "an' that's why I've come to you.
All I could do was. this: I went by
Craig's field an' seed that the fence
wasn't finished, but I couldn't say that
meant anything, fer Craig was slow
pay, an' no sensible person would keep
on workin' fer a dead man without
knowin' who was his boss, anyway."
"No, of course not," Abner agreed.
"Was that all?"
"No, not quite. I next set out to look
fer Abe. I seed 'im in a bunch o'
loafers at the cotton compress, whar
jobs by the hour was give out Xer
truckin' an' loadin' an' the like. I
knowed most of 'em. All the time Abe
set on a bale o' cotton whittlin' a stick
an' sa jin' nothin'. I noticed that he
wouldn't laugh much along with the
balance, but when I came to think of
it I couldn't remember ever seein' the
cuss smile or pass a joke nohow, an'
so, you see, I couldn't go by that. I
studied 'im a good hour. I got the
crowd to talk about the murder once,
au' I watched Abe, but I couldn't no
tice that he acted anyway different
from the rest. He jest set with his
feet crossed an' the brim o' his old hat
over his eyes an' trimmed straight in
front of 'im."
"I see. T see," Abner nodded, thought
fully.
"I set about in a sly, underhand way
among folks that had knowed Abe a
long time, to see ef he'd ever been in
any difficulties. Now, here comes the
only p'int I've found worth considerin',
an' I want yore opinion. Ten years
ago, when Abe lived over the moun
tain, he was arrested "an' tried fer as
sault on a feller an' put in jail fer
year. The feller who he mighty nigh
killed owned a little sawmill whar Abe
was workin', an' one day at log rollin'
the sawmill man got mad at Abe fer
some blunder or other an' kicked 'ira
like a dog in the presence o' all the
rest. Now, watch close, Uncle Ab.
Witnesses said on oath at the trial that
Abe tuck his kickin' without a word,
lid' rolled logs on the rest o' the day
an' drawed his pay; but that night evi
donee showed that he waylaid the saw
mill man, beat 'im over the head with
a hickory club an' left 'im unconscious
In the road."
"It is sofue'n' anyway," Abner an
swered interestedly. "Let's go youder,
have a chew and plan this thing fur
ther," Abner continued.
One sultry evening at dusk, as Abner
sat talking to Mary about Howard in
the front yard, Abe Fulton trudged
along past the gate, a small bag of
flour on his shoulder. He did not look
toward them, but kept his eyes on the
dusty road. Seeing that Mary was
looking at the man. Abner remarked
casually:
"That feller looks like he is purty
hard up. He had a regular job work
in' fer Craig, but that's all off now, of
course."
"I'm sorry for his wife." Mary said
listlessly. "I don't believe the poor
creature gets enough to cat half the
time, and as for clothes, she is a pitiful
sight. I've heard that she is constantly
complaining."
At this instant Mrs. Tflimbley called
Mary into the house, and Abner was
left alone. Going to the gate, he look
ed after the disappearing figure be had
just noted: then he glanced back into
the house. "Might as well now
later." he mused. "Time is valuable
an' after all Pole may be away off the
track. Twenty men could 'a' done the
thing as well as this un."
Taking a cautious look into the
house, Abner slipped around the cor
ner and went down the path to the
stable. Opening the door of a stall
containing his favorite horse, he took
the animal by the forelock and led it
across the lot to a gate, which lie
opened. Then, raising his hands
threateningly, he drove the horse
through, watching it as it galloped off
into the woods. Then going to * wa
on shed near by Abner took a bridl
from a row of saddles and baiters, and
with it on his arm he passed through
the gate and started down the road,
the leather reins dragging in the dust
at his side. Half a mile farther on he
turned aside into the wood and walked
through the twilight ti.ll he saw
gleam of fire through the trees and
knew it was from the cabin occupied
by Abe Fulton and his wife, nere Ab
ner began to walk more slowly, and as
lie moved toward the light lie whistled
loudly after the manner of farmers
calling their horses. Presently he
emerged from the low, scattering
bushes immediately in front of the
cabin. Mrs. Fulton came to the door,
her hands white with some dough shç
was mixing.
"Lost yo' boss, Mr. Daniel?" she ask
ed as she recognized him and noticed
the bridle in bin hand.
"Yes. Have you seed 'im?" Abner
came closer. "He's the very devil tq
1
be
a
lip a halter when he's hitched to a
|iost. He I'anit the trick,somehow, an'
haiu't never broke 'Ini-of it."
"No, I hain't noticed H loose boss o
any sort," the woman answered. "May
be Alie has; Lie's just come from town.
Say, Abe"—she turned to look into the
shin—"have you seed anything o' Mr
Daniel's hoss?"
There was no immediate answer, but
crunching tread came »from within,
and Abe slouched forward into the
doorway. Abner remarked a certain
restless stare in the man's eyes and
fancied that lie saw a jnyitcd look of
despair in the almost brutàl face.
'No, I hain't seen no lioss," Abe said.
•Excuse me; I smell my bsutyi a-burn
in'," Mrs. Fulton exclaimed suddenly.
'Abe, give Mr. Daniel a chair. Pil bet
he's tired." '
Abe went into the cabin and brought
out a crude, splint bottomed chair, and
when Abner had taken ft Abe sat down
on a wash bench near by* •
"Yes, I think it is the indoor work
that does me up, Abe,'"*£J»jier went on
liiily. "A feller tliaps lived on a
farm all his life makes a poor out at
a job like my new one. I acted the
plumb fool when I put good money in
that plant But you know, of course,
that I was countin' on Howard Tins
ley to run it fer me; but» la me, consid
erin' the plight the boy's-got hisse'f in.
that's all off, an' I've jfbt the bag to
hold, green as 1 am,"
The man tapped the toe of his ragged
shoe with the battling stick. He swal
lowed. glanced furtively àt Abner and
cleared his throat. Presently, with a
wavering glance, he jerked out:
"He'll come out all right."
"Humph! I say," Abner sniffed,
what makes you thinjt^hat, Abe?"
"Oh, because fellers Irae him always
come clear. Howard's got influential
kin, an' he stands at' the top. The
courts are a sort o' Joke an' so is the
general run o' juries. A feller jest has
to have a little pull in politics, a few
dollars behind 'im an' wear good clothes
to git out o' anything." - ;
I wish you was right; I really do,"
Abner answered. "YouSiln't as old as
1 am by a long sight. Abe." Abner's
tone had never been ko confidential
and friendly. "You aint seed as much
tawin'. Billy Barnett as you may
know, is as keen a practitioner as the
state has got. I've retained him, an
he's workin' with might an' main ou
the case, but him nor toe nor all the
law in the world can't do a thing as
long as Howard bolds-out as he is
doin'."
"Holds out?" For the first time the
lance of the small eyes sought Abner's
inquiringly. "What do you mean by
boldin' out?" *
Abner seemed to besäte, and when
lie finally spoke it was as if he had de
cided that he might fall deeper Into
confidence with a man whom he
trusted.
"Why. Abe, Just between you an
me. I'm afraid that the boy's bullhead
ed stubbornness is goin' to block all
our efforts In his behalf. You know the
law well euough. All of us know the
law well enough to know that the
courts are lenient when a man comes
right out an' admits that he done a
wrong thing/ I'm talkin' to you now
ns a friend an' a neighbor. In fact.
I've heard Howard say lots o' nice
things about you an' yore wife, an
I know you are interested in his wel
fare. an' will hate to hear how he is
actin'. But the truth is—the sad truth
is—that he won't listen to reason. Talk
as we will, the boy sticks to his plan
o' claimin' that be knows nothin' at all
about tlie shootinV*
"Well, maybe he don't!" burst im
pulsively from the man on the bench
"A feller ain't guilty till he's proved
guilty."
Abner's eyes gleamed.
"I'm glad to hear you stand up fer
'im. anyway. Abe." Abner went on
suavely: ''but, ncscrtbeless. 1 wouldn't
like fer you to talk to him on that line
Thar's too much evidence agin Min."
"Yes, I have—that is. I've heard folk
talk. I know all they are a-sayin'. I
I don't blame Howard. He—he'd be n
fool to say he done it Unless—unless he
done it, no matter what you an' Bar
nett advise. Life's too short. Huh. ef
Howard claims he didn't do It. maybe
lie didn't He's always treated me
fair. Tiie boy lent me some- money
once whpn I couldn't git it from any
body else."
"Oh, yes, Howard has a big heart in
'im, an' this is killin' 'im. You only
have to think about it -Abe. to see
how humiliated lie must be. He was
jest gittin' a firm foothold in this new
line. The papers all over the state was
talkin' about him au' his work. Dar
ley is right now gittin' on a boom
whicli Howard set afoot A new rail
road is cornin', a site has been select
ed an' bought in the edge o' town fer
a cotton mill with thousands of spin
dies that will give employment to
mountain folks fer miles around. But
right in the middle of it the silly boy
lets his hot temper git the best of 'im.
He lias a few words with a feller that
nobody liked an' then waylays 'im
shoots 'im dead in his tracks, an', of
course—well, lie'll have to take his
medicine, that's ail"
"I don't believe Howard done It
Fulton blurted, "because yon say be
says lie didn't."
"What you believe don't settie the
matter." Abner said, as if contemptu
ous of an opinion which seemed so ill
grounded. "Howard can't prove noth
in' at all to offset the evidence pilin'
up mountain high agin 'im. Lawyers
judges an' experts generally are laugh
in- at his stupidity in boldin' ont like
he is doin'. You ain't entirely alone
in yore opinion. Abe; thar's his mam
my. You'd hardly exjieet that broken
hearted woman to doubt the word of
her only child, an' 1 wouldn't talk as
free with her as I have to you. Ef she
sees fit to be'ievo Howard's cock an
bull yarn about steepin' on that mr.e.n
fain an' a!! the rest he made up—well,
that's jest her right. Then that is an

all
other one that won't listen to reason
nuther, an' that Is Mary Trumliley. I
lon't know fer sure, but I imagine ef
this calamity hadn't fallen them two
ould 'a* hit it off together. La. Abe,
that's pitiful! I think sometimes ef
she'd jest jine me an' Billy in advisin'
Howard to tell the whole truth that
he might be influenced to own up be
fore it is too late."
"He'd be a fool to do it," Abe mut
tered.
"Well, have it yore way," Abner
sighed. "After all, Abe. Craig was au
overbearin' man, wasn't he? You done
some work fer 'im now an' then an'
art to know as to that I remember
seein' you about his place. Ef he was
as bad as folks say you'd know it. 1
reckon?"
"He was a devil on human legs!"
Abe's eyes were flaring indignantly.
He deceived several young gals that
I knowed. One was a fust cousin o'
mine, a pore orphan, with nobody to
take lier part. He got 'er love some
way, an' after he'd left 'er high an'
dry fer another gal she used to hang
around the woods tryin' to see the
skunk. She broke down an' told me
all about It. Oh. fcjniowed 'lm!"
CHAPTER XXII.
Making Progress.
H, that must have been Susy
Thomas!" Abner said to Abe.
"I remember her. She had a
sad. sweet face. I didn't
know she was any kin o' yore'n,
though, Abe. It must 'a' been on yore
mammy's side."
'She was the youngest one o' the
children my mother's sister Molly left
when she died," Abe answered. "How
Craig managed to fool 'er as he did 1
don't know. He was old enough to be
her daddy an' as quarrelsome as a
bear. Oh, I know a lot more that 1
could tell you, but I jest can't."
"She certainly was to be pitied." Ab
ner was looking away at the sky In
the west, which still held a faint red
glow of the passing daylight. "1
haven't seen 'er, though, fer several
months now."
"You never will ag'in," Abe said, -bis
great breast rising high and falling.
"Oh, is that so?" Abner went on
'Then she's left the country?"
"Yes; the Norton family—folks that
bad been good to 'er an' overlooked her
misfortune—was movin' out to Texas
on a farm. They didn't like to leave
er so destitute, an' they said they
thought maybe a change o' climate
would do 'er good an' iu time make 'er
forglt Craig."
"Well, I hope it did 'er good, Abe."
There was just a hint of delay in
Fulton's response. Then his face dark
ened, and his voice quivered under a
flood of passion. "She died," he said.
'The medicine—the operation—or what
ever it was killed her. Mrs. Norton
wrote me nil about It Susy suffered
awful. She was in her right mind up
to the very last minute. She sent me
message—said I was the only livin'
kin she ever had that had treated her
half decent."
"now God could let a man like Craig
live as long as he did is a wonder to
me," Abner said. "I feel better about
Howard's case now than I did, Abe.
an' I'm glad I run across you. La, ef
Susy Thomas had jest 'a' been bis fust
cousin now a jury would clear 'lm
without leavin' the'r seats. Ef I was
on a jury in a case like that I'd git 'em
to' give three whoopin' cheers fer the
accused, an' we'd ride 'im out o' court
on our shoulders an' take 'im in tri
umph from one end o' town to t'other.
But pore Howard, he hain't got no
claim like that to help lilni ont!"
"I don't believe Howard done it,"
Abe said, a futile stare in his eyes.
"You say be claims he didn't, an' that

ought to settle it with any reasonable
tbinldn' person. His word ort to be
enough."
"His word ain't worth a hill o' beans
In the matter," Abner said contemptu
ously. "In fact, he won't be allowed
to testify. He kin make a statement,
you know, an' the jury kin respect it
or not, as it sees fit But they won't
respect Howard's tale ou top o' all
that has happened. Craig had a bad
temper an' tried several times to wipe
his feet on the boy. Howard knowed
what a bad stripe he was an' despised
lm an' said so time after time. All
that will go agin the boy at the trial,
«n' he had plenty o' time to deliberate
Tore actin'. I reckon Craig was rough
with you. too. Abe. He was with ev
erybody else he dealt with."
"Huh! Me? I was dirt under his
lordly feet."
"He was slow pay. too. I've always
heard." Abner said "The storekeepers
In town are hit hard an' wonderin' ef !
the estate will pay out, mortgaged as
it is up to the hilt. I reckon be owed
you some'n' along with tlie balance?"
"For a month's hard work, more or
less," was the answer, "but I'll not put
in no claim. I don't want no lawsuit."
"I'd git my rights, Abe," Abner said.
"You owe it to yore wife. Let's see.
when did you see 'im last, Abe?"
"Me? Why?" Abe's eyelashes flicker
ed. "Le'me think. Why, the last time
was as he was startin' off to town the
day that''— Abe failed to finish, drop
ping his glance to the ground.
"I know." Abner prompted him; "the
day him an' Howard had the fuss on
the street."
"Yes, that was the time," Fulton an
swered unsuspectingly. "He was boss
back an'—an' drinkin', as usual."
"I see he rid by here."
Abe cast a vacant look at the placid
questioner, then he nodded. "Yes, I
was at the pen thar feedin' my pig. I
reckon it was about 8 o'clock or a little
after. He—he could hardly set in the
saddle. I wasn't surprised when I
heard about the fuss."
"It was a little bit out o' his most
direct way to come by here, wasn't it?''
Abner's tone was even and careless.
"The bee line way from his house to
town is by Trumbley's, ain't it?"
"I don't know." Abe said, slightly
disturbed by the demand. "It may be
shorter by Trumbley's. Anyway, Craig
was too drunk to know which xvay he
was goin'."
"The administrator will not git much
fer his farm in the conàitiou it's in,"
Abner remarked casually. "I happened
to notice that he started you to bulldin'
a new wire fence. I reckon you never
finished it, not knowin' whar yore
wages would come from now that he's
dead."
"I throwed that job up," Abe flashed
out impulsively. "He wouldn't plank
down a cent, although I was out o'
grub. He come over to whar I was at
work that last mornin' an' cussed mo
black an' blue fer makin' a little mis
take. After he rid off I shouldered my
tools an' quit."
"I see." Abner spat straight toward
the firelight, slowly rose to his feet,
his hands In his pockets, the bridle
thrown over tils shoulder. "An' Craig
rid straight off to town an' had hi3
fuss with Howard. His little tiff with
you started 'im out fer the day, an' he
wanted to git back at somebody."
Yes, I heard that evenin' that he'd
jumped on Howard." Abe fell into the
trap. "Craig didn't care fer man, God
nor devil."
"That time in the field was the very
last you seed of 'im alive," Abner re
marked adroitly.
The very last tlme."._Abe said un
guardedly. *
"But let's see. Didn't I hear you to
say, Abe," Abner remarked, now star
ing steadily, "that the last sight you
had of 'im was while you was at that
pigpen thar an' he rid by goin' to
town?"
Fulton's beetling brows met in a
frown of perplexity. "Did I say that?'
he asked. "That must 'a' been anoth
er time. My memory ain't as good- as
it used to be."
'Mine ain't nuther." Abner threw
his shoulders back and yawned. "Well,
I must be goin'."
Down the road, when in sight of
Trumbley's barn, Abner saw Pole
Baker.
A purty tramp you been havin', Un
de Ab," he began, with a smile. "You
went exactly the wrong direction. I
seed yore boss just now back o' my
place. He's thar yit nibblin' at a fine
patch o' grass. Gi' me yore bridle.
I'm spryer 'n j'ou are In the legs, ef 1
ain't smarter In the head, au' I never
yit seed a hoss 1 couldn't halter."
Abner gave the bridle to him, and as
Pole bore it briskly away he strolled on
homeward. Ten minutes later, as Ab
ner stood waiting at the gate of tbe
lot, Pole rode up ou the bare back of
the horse, his legs swinging to and fro
from the animal's flanks. lie laughed
in a significant way as he slid down to
the ground.
"Fer a wild, runaway boss," he said,
"this un was the easiest to catch I
ever run across. He come up to me of
his own accord, jest the same as to
say, 'Ef you an' Uncle Ab are through
playin' tag with me I'll go home to
bed.' ''
"Humph!" Abner said, his mind evF
dently far away, as lie opened the gate
and let the horse loose in the lot
"You kin sniff ef you want to," Pole
said, with a meaning smile. "I ain't
a-goin' to pry into yore business,
though I'll admit I'm losin' sleep over
the very thing you are thinkiu' about
at this minute. Hidin' back jest now
it struck me that a feller o' yore wide
experience wouldn't meander off on a
bare, rocky hiljsldo lookin' for a hoss
that's out after grass when you know
mighty well that it grows on low
grounfi. You mought lie an' say you'd
already been whar I found tbe hoss,
but that wouldn't pass my Adam's ap
ple, fer I seed from the grass that had
been topped In one spot tluA the hoss
had been thar a good while."
"Y'ou are gittin' awfully sharp, Pole,"
Abner said, with a sudden smile. "You
said t'other night on the mountain that
thar was some delicate things I could
work better 'n you. I don't believe It''
"I know whar you've been," Pole
said eagerly. "You've been to see Abe
Fulton. You have been, hain't yon, old
man?"
Abner nodded silently, the worried
expression stealing back into his face.
"I knowed it!" Pole cried triumph
antly. "Well, what's yore opinion? Is
It likely that Abe done it?"
"I think he did, Pole." Abner answer
ed slowly. "I am purty sure be done
it, but that don't git ns out o' the mire
by a long shot."
»»"You say it don't?" Pole's voice sank
and a shadow crossed his face.
"No, it douV Abner went ou. "Pt«

plumb success, but in ail of 'em thar
was outside happenin's. an' facts to
pick up au' piece together till the man
was tied hand and foot, but in this
case, Pole, the truth lies away down
in tltc heart of a single hitman bein'.
In my opinion Abe is the feller that
done the deed, hut it is jest my private
opinion, an' that ain't wuth a straw
when it comes as an offset to all the
facts agin Howard."
After Abner left him Abe Fulton re
mained seated on tlie wash bench, bis
head dejectedly lowered. Presently
his wife appeared in tbe doorway.
"Supper was ready some time ago,"
she announced, "but I didn't want to
call you while Mr. Daniel was here.
We ÿaln't got nothin' fit to offer 'im,
nor no plates or decent cups and sau
cers. I wish you'd buy some, Abe. You
have no idea how 'shamed a woman
feels In a pinch like this.
"I overheard part o' what Mr. Daniel
was sayin' about Howard Tinsley,"
Mrs. Fuiton said as site sat down and
filled his plate with tlie young corn
and cnbbnge, which was boiled with
pork and gnve forth an appetizing
smell. "He's sensible, a sight more so
than the boy's mammy, who still
claims ho never done it. Yon can't
fool a man like Abner Daniel. He
knows thar ain't no use contendin'
ng'in plain facts, an' he knows that tho
shortest way out o' tlie trouble is to
tell the truth. Folks love to see a man
brave enough to teil the truth in secli
a case, an' the court would deal lighter
with Howard ef he'd listen to advice
like Mr. Daniel could give."
"Nobody knows all about it." Abe
let his full fork rest on his plate. "No
body but—but the one most concerned
could know It nil. I'm—I'm sorry fer
Howard Tinsley myself, so I am."
"Well, he ortn't to be bullheaded an*
hold back from sensible advice," the
woman answered.
Mrs. Fulton went to the hearth for
some more food and failed to notice
that her husband was not eating as
freely as usual. He was swallowing
his food in a mechanical way, not pay
ing any attention to her. She came
back, sat down and reached out for his
plate. He extended it automatically.
He was very pale, but in the red fire
light the fact was not observable.

Kelly the Dandy.
Eccentrics have flourished in every
age, but possibly they were at their
height tu the days of George III. aud
the regency, when to be odd was con
sidered fashion.able. Take the case of
Lieutenant Colonel Kelly of the (then)
First Foot guards, who was a very
vain, emaciated looking dandy, but at
tbe same time a gentleman. "He was
haughty in the extreme itnd very fond
of dress. His boots were so well var
nished that the polish now in use
could not surpass Kelly's blacking in
brilliancy. His pantaloons were made
of the finest leather, and his coats were
inimitable. In short, his dress was
considered perfect."
Kelly was burned to death while
trying to stive Ills favorite boots, and
the story goes that the dnmlles com
peted among themselves to secure the
services of his valet, who knew the se
cret of the blacking. Brutmnel was
one of the competitors, but the man
told him that the £150 a year he lmd
been accustomed to receive was not
enough for his talent and that bo
should require £200, upon which the
Beau replied, "Well, if you will make
it guineas I shall be happy to attend
upon yon."—Westminster Gazette.
Alaska's Natural Submarines.
The channels of the Alaskan water
ways vary as you sail on to the north
ward. Now they widen into great
lakes; now they are rivets as narrow
as the Hudson or Rhine. At times yon
pass through gorges walled by Islands
and the mainland, and at times you ure
in fiords like those formed by the half
sunken Andes along western Patago
nia, near the strait of Magellan. This
part of our territory is made up of the
heads of submerged mountains, and in
places there are great rocks as steep,
as high and ns sharp as the Washing
ton monument, which come within
twenty or thirty feet of the surface.
These are teMible pinnacle rocks that
rip open the hulls of the steamers.
They are searched for and marked
with buoys by tho wire drag of our
coast and geodetic survey.—Christian
Herald.
Canny Human Skill.
The ocean comes up and smashes
our beaches and our piers; the wind
blows down old houses and walls aud
trees; the rain fills up crock beds and
basements and comes up over tho
floors of stores, with some damage to
silks and sugar. It Is all very big and
scary and horrendous, but stiil tbe
puny human climbs quietly into bis
dry street car, tbe antlike commuter
crawls aboard his chip sized ferryboat,
the steamer swings and dances through
the typhoon, and the cigar box office
building laughs at the racket and the
fuss. There is skill behind tlie car,
the boat, the building; canny human
skill that keeps cool and is not to bo
bluffed even by the winds and waters
of the earth, and nature may lose its
temper all it wants; it loses it quite
fruitlessly.—San Francisco Bulletin.
He Was Right.
A man rushed to the entrance of a
lunatic asylum In the middle of the
night and yelled to the keeper to let
him in.
"Let me in!" he cried. "I have sud
denly gone insane."
The keeper woke up. thrust his head
out of a first story window and bt-L
lowed down in a rage;
"What? Come here at this time of
night? Man, you must be crazy!"—
