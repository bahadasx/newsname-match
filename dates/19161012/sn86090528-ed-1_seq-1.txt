PLAIN PRESENTATION
OF PRESIDENT'S CASE
Sets Forth Policies and Deeds of Admin
istration and Asks for Vote of
Confidence
Before the hour set for Congress
man Scott Ferris to speak Wednesday
evening; the district court room was
filled to overflowing and standing
room was at a premium. When Mr.
Ferris arrived shortly after 8' o'clock,
not only was the room packed but peo
ple filled the stairway and the adja
cent room occupied by the court clerk.
In the rear of the court room and out
side many stood for over an hour, lis
tening intently to every word spoken
by the Lawton statesman and the en
tire audience gave abundant manifes
tations of approval throughout. In the
audience were many ladies, including
a large delegation of college girls.
The speaker received an ovation
when he entered the room and Mr. J.
I). Carmichael immediately began his
Introductory speech in which he paid
a splendid tribute to Mr. Ferris.
Scarcely ever raising hjs voice above
the conversational tone, the speaker
in, unadorned language reviewed the
principal accomplishments of the na
tional administration, making a plain
plea, for a vote of confidence in Presi
dent Wilson and his policies which
have brought the nation "peace and
prosperity." In the course of his
speech he advised his audience con
cerning the sinister influences, Includ
ing the forces of "big business," that
are at work to bring about the down
fall of Woodrow Wilson and admonish
ed Democrats and all others who want
to see the president's policies prevail
to be on guard Bt the polls in Novem
ber. Iu part, Mr. Ferris spoke sub
stantially as follows:
"In days like these every man owes
it to himself and his country to give
thought to national affairs and vote on
November 7th. All good citizens
should exercise this duty arid right.
"The Democrats assert that the Wil
son administration has enacted more
good laws in the interest of the peo
ple in four years than the Republicans
enacted in fifty. It has fulfilled its
promises... To repeal any. one of these
laws, to turn their administration
over to a hostile party would be folly.
Tho country is more prosperous today,
than ever before and every class of
citizens shares in the prosperity. Pres
ent Wilson by good judgment, states-

terrified steadfastness has kept our
country at peace with the world.
True to Farmers.
"Wilson has been true every day of
his administration to the six and one
half million farmers of the country.
Think of the wise legislation, the ru
ral credits law, tho good roads law,
thn nirriciilttiral extension law. H
ias been true to the twenty million
workmen of the country, who for six
teen long years, under Republican
rule plead in vain for needed legisla
tion. President Wilson has been true
every day. to honest and legitimate
business, displacing our barbarous
banking system by a wise federal re
serve act, approving the federal trade
commission and other measures. He
has been true to the civil war veter-
uns and every other interest of Ameri-

administration had done. The second

position was purely critical with noth-

by the facts at that. It was that the
president had turned out a patriot
to put a horse doctor in the govern
ment service. As soon as the facts of
the case were known he abandoned
this and with it Ills charge against the
president for interference with the civ
il service.
"Driven away from other grounds,
Mr. Hughes desperately seized ori the
eight-hour law and this he still insists
shall he the burning issue. This law
was passed by a vote of 2,1! members
of congress, 70 of them being Repub
licans. The railroad net earnings for
the past year are $707,000,000 in ex
cess of those of the last year of the
Taft administration, and some force
is given to the claim of the brother-j
hoods that the y should partially share
in this tremendous increase of earn-
ings. To denounce their claim as un-
just is to say that prosperity shall
come to inanimate things, such as steel'
rails and cars, but not to human'brain J
and muscle. The great strike was j
averted and the eight-hour law is aj
credit to the Democratic adniinlstrv

MAD KING
OTTO DIES
AGED 70
Brother of Crazy King Ludwig He Dis
played Signs of Insanity During
Franco-Russian War
By United Press.
Copenhagen, Oct. 12. King Otto, of
Bavaria, Europe's "mad king," died
suddenly in the castlo of Puerstenried
where he has been confinod for several
years, according to a dispatch reach
ing here today.
Otto was about seventy years of age.
Nominally he succeeded his brother
Ludwig II in 1896 when the latter
hrew himself into a lake in a fit of
insanity. His uncle, Regent Luitpoid,
was tho real ruler, however.
During the Franco-Prussian war Ot
to I first showed symptoms of insanity
when he ordered cavalry charges at a
stone wall, declaring the wajl to be
French infantry. He was then put un
der medical escort and declared inca
pable of ruling. On Nov. ii, 11)13, be
was succeeded by his cousin, Ludwig
III, and since then hej has lived like
a savage in the castle wehre he died,
refusing to bathe or allow his hair and
nails to be trimmed. He avoided food
for days at a time, believing that his
servants were trying to poison h'im.
Ho was examined by a sanity commis
sion on April 27 each year.

Like tho deserted orphans which

tho Red Sox, requiring only one more
victory to cinch the honor of being
the world's leaders in .1!1, entered

did splendid execution for the homo
nine, holding the visitors down to
three hits, and allowing them only one
run which was made in the second.
On the other hand Pfeffer, pitching
for the Dodgers, let the Red Sox in for
seven hits which were delivered at op
portune times for the winning team.
The home team had tho game prac

Meetings Suggested at Which to Instruct
Farmers on Value of $60,000 Bond
Issue for Permanent F;ir
DIFFICULTIES OF
$2,500 FREE FAIRS
Representative of Bond Buyer Here Who
is Anxious to Take Up Matter
of Purchase
As yet no concerted action has been
taken by tho fanners for an organized
movement in hchalffof the proposi
tion to vote $00,000 free .fair bonds in
case such authority should later he
given the board of county commission
ers at a future session ef the sute leg
islature. The straw ballots H be
printed at tho expense of the farmer;;
and will bo placed at the disposal of
the voters at the regular ele-tion next
month. It is suggested that meetings
be held to instruct the farmers who
have not already, signed the petition
on tho benefits to be derived from a
permanent free county fair conducted
on a scale compatible with the impor
tance of Grady county and its exhibits.
"With but two or three exceptions
tho farmers who were in attendance
at the last fair signed the petition with
out a moment's hesitation and the oth
ers readily affixed their signatures as
soon as the situation was explained to
them," said W. E. Smith today. VI
um not in favor' of $2500 free fairs
for justice cannot be done either to
exhibits or t; exh:t:; h ' even under
the best conditions in tents and frame
stalls such as we have had and this
appropriation requires too much slash
ing of premium lists. Wo want to give
the farmer a chance to show his pro
ducts to the best advantage and see
that he is comfortably accommodated
when he, comes eithdr to attend the
fair or to ' place his exhibits there.
What would have happened this year
had we had a hard rain? With perma
nent stalls and exhibit halls a rain
would not be so disastrous.
"Then again, we have sent about
$100(1 out of the county for tents dur
ing the past two years. That would
build a substantial building for' the
exhibition of stock. The" conditions
prevailing here during the last fair
were really dangerous to stock that
was not closely watched both day and
night and fine animals might have
been permanently injured had it not
been for tho vigilance of their owners.
"Grady county needs a permanent
fair fund and sho can produce a fair
which will be the superior of any town
approaching the size of Chickasha iu
the state."
Interest is already being aroused in
the suggested $00,000 permanent free
fair bond issue for Grady county in
investment circles. J. H. Jenkins, who
was here this week representing an
Oklahoma City dealer in municipal '
bonds, in informal talks with members
of the board of county commissioners
and with prominent citizens interested
in tho movement, expressed a desire
to participate in the bidding for these
bonds and stated that his firm would
investigate all legal technicalities and
set the county right .
