Newport, R. I.?The executive offioer
of the destroyer Ericsson, returning
from the scene of the German
submarine activities off Nantucket,
reported that nine ships had been
sunk and that three submarines were
operating off the coast. This information,
he said, he had on the authority
of the captain of the Nantucket
Shoals LlahtshiD.
Newport, R. I.?Four destroyers of
the American flotilla came Into harbor
here bringing 216 persons rescued
from the ships sunk off Nantucket
Sunday by a German submarine. The
Ericsson, one of the destroyers to arrive,
brought 8, the Drayton 68; the
Benham 36 and the Jenkins 31. Thirtyfive
women and ten children are
among those on the Ericsson. This
Information came by wireless in advance
of the actual docking of the destroyere.
Boston.?A submarlno of the Imperial
German Navy, ravaged shipping
off the eastern coast of the
United States Sunday.
Four British, one Dutch and one
Norwegian steamer were sent to the
bottom or left crippled derelicts off
Nantucket Shoals. All night under
the light of the hunters moon the
destroyer tlotlla of the United States
Atlantic fleet was picking: up passengers
and crews of the destroyed vessels
and bringing them into Newport,
Rhode Island.
So far sa known there was no loss
of life although at a late hour the
crew of the British steamer Kingston
had not been accounted for. A submarine
held up the American steamer
Kansan, bound from New York
for Genoa with steel for the Italian
Government, but later on establishing
her identity allowed the Ameri

The submarine is believed to be the

and disappeared at sunsot. Some
naval men. however, declared that nt
least two submarines are operating
close to the American shore though
outside tlio three-mile limit.

IRINES SINK I
WO NEUTRAL,
MGLAND COAST
Shock Follows Sensation.
Tho sensation created when the
U-53 quietly slipped Into Newport harbor
and as quietly slipped away three
hours later, was Ie?? ihnn tho
in shipping circles when wireless ro- '
ports of submarine attacks began to
come into the naval radio stations. :
Within a few minutes the air was literally
charged with electricity as
wireless messages of warnings were
broadcasted along the coast. The !
submarine or submarines had taken
a position directly in the steamer
lanes, where they could hardly miss 1
anything bound in for New York or ;
bound east from that port.
Vessels of the Entente Allied Na- ;
tions and neutral bottoms carrying |
contraband of war scurried to get I
within the three-mile limit of the
American shore. Several that were
following the outside course shifted j
and made for the Inside lane. The
Stepliano. of the lted Cross line, however.
was caught outside the neutral
zone. The destruction of this vessel
was perhaps the biggest prize of the
day. The craft had been sold to the
Russian Government and would have
been used as an icebreaker after her
present trip.
Throughout the day and up to late
at night, none of the patrolling fleet
maintained by the British and French
to protect their own shipping and ,
American ships carrying munitions
of war had been sighted. Frantic
appeals were sent to Halifax.
Stirs Up Halifax.
"All steps possible in the circumstances
are being taken to deal with
the situation."
This message was received by the
Associated Press from the commanderin-chief
of the British North Atlantic
squadron at Halifax. N. S. It was In
reply to a request for a statement by
him. Tho work of the patrolling
fleets was directed from Halifax and
ever since the war began cruisers and
auxiliary vessols of the British and
French navies have moved up and
down the coast. Tho passengers and
crews of destroyed vessels who were
being brought into Newport were not
expected to reach there until after
midnight.
Prepa rat ions to care for them had
been made by Roar Admiral Knight,
commandant of the Narfanganaett Bay
naval station, and Rear Admiral
(.leaves, commander of the destroyer
flotilla now at Newport.

Nantucket lightship and was attacked
by gunfire and a torpedo. She remained
afloat until 10:05 o'clock.
The West Point went down 10 miles
south of the Nantucket lightship. The
Strathdeno was attacked "off lightship"
the reports stated and the
lUoomersjidk was sunk three miles
south of the lightship. She remained
afloat some time going down at 8:05.
The American steamer Kans&n was
held up three metis east of Nantucket
lightship.
West Point Gave Warning.
Tho flrst wireless warning of the
presence of a hostile submarine in the
steamship lane was given in the dis'
ress signals of the West Point which
reported that she had been torpedoed
10 miles southeast of Nantucket light. I
This message apparently was picked
lp by every vessel having a wireless
quipment within range for within a
ery short time press dispatches from
't. Johns. N. P.. and Halifax, N. S.,
ndicated that the patrolling warships
had received the alarm. The Ilritish
ensorship. however, prevented the
lisclosure of the movements of tho
patrolling vessels.
Booming of Guns Heard.
The booming of the submarine's
guns, apparently fired In warning,
was distinctly lieart at Nantucket. It
was plain that the submarine had
placed herself in the lane of passen:er
and freight traffic and terrorized
shipping along the coast.
In a flash after tho flrst distress
signals of the West Point were sent,
wireless messages of warning were
sent broadcast.
Kvery vessel was warned to make
for the three-mile scono and the commanders
of merchant vessels of the
V.ntento Allies lost no time la shift- ,
ing their course
Those that were following what is
known as the outside courso turned
to tho inside courso that would bring
them closer to American land.
Th? passenger stoat,irr Stephano, |
which plies regularly between New
York atitl St. Johns. N*. 1\. was hound
west and was due off Nantucket Monday
morning. When her Iiritish com
mander received his warning, ho was
said to have shifted his courso to
bring his vessel within the inside
lane.
Hritish consular officers along the
New England Coast, who had been ;
advised by the Iiritish Emhassay to !
warn Iiritish shipping against tho U
53 upon her appearance at Newport, |
renewed their caution on loarnlng
that the submarine had gone Into
action.
A WAR VIRTUALLY BROUGHT

UNITED STATES.
The European war virtually
has been brought to the shores .
of the United States. In the

Newport. It. I.?The British steamer
Stephano, bound front St. Johns, N.
F., to New York, carrying nearly 100
first and second cabin passengers, including
many American tourists, was
sunk off Nantucket lightship at 4:30
>. to Sunday presumably by the German
submarine U-63. The United
States torpedo l?oat destroyer Bairn
reported the loss of the liner by radio
to the naval station here, stating that
the ship hud been torpedoed. The
message from the destroyer said that
the crew was safe aboard the Ilalch,
but made no mention of the passengers.
who. it was thought here, also \
were taken care of.
Confirmation of the rescue of the ;
passengers by the Balch was con- '
tained in a later message sent by the
destroyer to the naval station here. It i
was said that she had picked up the
passengers and later had transferred
the Americans to tho destroyer Jenkins.
Rear Admiral Knight, commandant
v>f the Narrangansett naval district

fo do so would he allowed to remain on
tho warship until morning and that
every effort would he made hy officers i
and men to make them as comfortable
as possible. At the same time, ho j
said, if any of those picked op wanted
to he set ashore their wishes would
he complied with as promptly as jkisslblo.
Society Offers Aid.
: Members of the so called Newport
eociety set were prompt to extend proffers
of help to shipwrecked ixassengers
through Admiral Knight. Mrs. Hobert
i.,. neeKman, wife of Govornor lleekman
and Mrs. French Vanderbilt, volunteered
to take care of as many ret'u- j
frees as possltde. Many of the pas- |
sengers on the Stephano are residents
of New York. At this time of the year |
the vessel carries a fairly heavy pas- !
senger list made tip of summer tourists
who spend their summer sin New
FVninland and In the Canadian marlI
time provinces.
The cargo loss of the Stephano, It
was expected, would not he very heavy
a* on her westbound voyage she usually
carried little freight. This made
up largely, as a rule of flsli oil and
other fish products. The vessel was In
the regular service of the Red Cross
Line.
The sale of the Stepliano to the
I Russian govrnment which had planned
1 to use her as an Ice breaker, was rej
contlv announced. Her sister ship, the
Florlzel of the same line also had been
sold to Russia for ice work.
Stephano Stoutly Built.
The Stephano was of stout conI
ittruction, built especially for the
I heavy Ice conditions encountered 1n
winter sailings on the New Foundland
coast. It was expected in marine
j circles that this was intended as one
of the last regular sailings of the Stephano
prior to her sailing for tie
White Sea to work with a large fleet
engaged by Russia to keep her northernmost
port of Archangel open for
tke receipt of war supplies.
The liner was in command of Capt.
Smith, who it is thought had taken I
the outside conrsp inrounding Nantucket
lightship and had fallen into
the grip of the undersea raider.
COMPLICATIONS NOT FEARED
BY UNITED STATE OFFICIALS
'
Washington.?Submarine warfare at
the very doors of the United States :
does not necessarily portend further
complications with Germany so long j
as It is carried on within the limitatons
of international Ijiw.
That is the view of official Wash
ingcton on the record of one day's oper- j
~Mons in which nnno of the ships dostroyod
appears to have been attacked
without warning: or without proper
measures having: been taken for safe- j
ty of those aboard.
While in international law an Allied
ship tl 'stroyod by a German submarine
just outside the three-mile I mtt |
at d In siRht of American shores, is no
'Afferent than a ship destroyed In tho
/vrctic Ocean, provided its destruction
is accomplished In accordance with
the laws of nations and humanity,
the presence of a German submarine
flotilla near American territorial waters,
officials fear, may raise perplexing:
questions of neutrality and in fact
a most serious issue would he raised
if operations of submersible* were carried
on so near American porta to constitute
a blockade.

and Aft.
Newport. It. I.? Seventeen days
from Wilhelmshaven .the Imperial
German submarine U-53 dropped anchor
in Newport harbor.
Almost before the officers of the
American fleet of warships through
which the stranger had nosed her
way. had recovered from their astonishment,
the undersea lighter had delivered
a message for the German
Ambassador, and, weighing anchor
turned Brenton's reef lightship and
disappeared beneath the waves just
outside the three-mile limit.
She flew tho black and white colors
of the German Navy, a gun was
mounted on the forward deck and
another aft, while eight torpedoes
were plainly visible under the forward
deck.
Lieut.-Captain Hans Hose, commanding
the 11-53, said that he had
called at Newport simply to mail a
letter to Count von Bernstorff. He required
neither provisions nor fuel and
would be 011 his way, he said, long
before the 24 hours during which u
belligerent ship may remain within a
neutral harbor had expired.
The submarine was In American
waters a little more than three hours,
assuming that she continued to sea
after submerging. Within that time
the German commander paid offical
visits to Rear Admiral Knight commandant
of the second naval district,
and Roar Admiral Claves. commander
of the destroyer force of the Atlantic
fleet, who was on board the
flagship, the scout cruiser Birmingham.
Roth American officers returned
the brief call promptly.
While these formalities were being
exchanged wireless messages wore
carrying to the ships of the Rritisli
and French patrol fleet off the coast
and warning that a hostile submarine
had slipped through their cordon and
might be expected in the open sea
soon. At the forts and the naval sta
tion the fleet of Captain Hans Rose
was the one subject of conversation,
and there was much speculation as
to her mission.
The first question asked by Captain
Rose when a motor boat came
alongside was: "Have you heard
from the fireman?"
"When h(v was told that there was
no news of fhe missing craft his face
became grave but he made no comment.
To the naval men generally,
the most interesting fact disclosed by
Captain Rose was that he had been
nt sea 17 days and still had provisions
for three months, abundant fuel and
needed no repairs. Not so much as a
bottle of water was taken aboard and
the ship was spick and span.
The U-53 had made her way
through the fleet of 37 United States
warships, including destroyers and
nuuiuui men, iu mi tiiii'iiui H^?*. * up*
tain Rose tolrl the correspondent that
he had come In to mall a letter to
fount, von Bernstorff and asked for
the newspaper man's credentials.
The latter exhibited an Associated
Tress badge and was intrusted with
the correspondence for the Ambassador.
"Please forward this letter to
fount Rornstorff," said the captain,
"and report my arrival. They will be
glad to hear It."

CREW OF ONE SHIP MISSING
Raider, Supposedly U-53, Disappears
and Leaves No Trace of Us Course
After Wholesale Raid Off Nantucket
Lighthouse.
Newport. It. I.?The wholesale raid
on foreign shipping south of Nantucket
Lightship was the work of one sub- 1
marine, according to reports of American
naval officers. Rear Admiral j
Albert Gleaves, commanding the torpedo-boat
destroyer Hot ilia which did
such remarkable speedy rescue work,
said that the reports of all his officers
agreed that to the best of their obser:
vat ion one raider only was concerned,
i This boat presumably was the Gerj
man U-53, which called at Newport.
Admiral Gleaves said he could easily
understand the positive statements of
! the captain of the Nantucket lightship
and of sailors of the torpedoed ves|
sels that more than one submarine
i was concerned. The U-boat he said
| was very fast and appeared to have
; been handled cleverly. It was easy,
he pointed out, for her to disappear
j on one side of a ship and then show
up unexpectedly at another spot.
Doubtless, he believed, she had submerged
and reappeared often enough
to mislead any but a keen professional
observer and to create the int '
i pression that more than one sea tor
' ror was operating.
This opinion would seem to he
borne out by the statements of many
of the refugees that the submarine j
had more business on hand than she i
| could take care of at once and was
obliged to request one steamer to
wait her turn while another was being
put out of commission. Lieuten
it ii l * ommanuer Miner ot tne destroy!
er Ericsson, who witnessed the do- j
struetlon of tin* Stephano said he was
j positive that only one submarine was
i in the vicinity at the time.
The raiding has ceased, at least
! for the moment.
The known list of the victims of the
U-boat's exploits remains at six. notwithstanding
reports from the Nan- j
tucket Lightship that three other
i ships, the identity of which could not
i be learned, were sent to the bottom.
| There also was a persistent rumor, i
j without verification that a British
cruiser one of the Allied patrol fleet
sent to the submarine zone, had been
, attacked .

"GOTO-SUNDAY-SCKOOL"DAY
South Carolina Association Designates
February 11, 1917, Date For Great
Attendance.
Spartanburg. At a special meeting
of tlm central committee of the South ]
Carolina Sunday School Association,
held in the office in the Chapman j
building recently. February 11. 1917. j
was adopted as the state wide "Go-toSundav
School Day." for South Caro- j
Una.
"Go-to-Sunday School Day" was or- I
igniated by the Kentucky Sunday
School Association a few years ago
as at state-wide interdenominational J
movement. Since that time, it has
heen adopted by oilier state Sunday |
School associations and some of the
denominations. The purpose of the
"Come-to-Sunday School Day" in
South Carolina is to get as many peo
pie as posible. not ordinarily in the
habit of going to Sunday school, to
come at least one Sunday; then make
them welcome on this Sunday, inform
them of the work, provide them with
suitable classes and Competent teachers.
and use every effort to enroll
them as permanent members of the
school.
There are now enrolled in the
white Sunday schools of South Carolina
about 200.000 people. If all the
Sunday schools will join In this cooperative
campaign, it is believed
that one-third of a million people will
ho in attendance on February 11. An
extensive plan of publicity will begin
in December, and all needed supplies
will be in the state Sunday school
office rondy for distribution early in
January.
The central committee also took
steps toward preparing for the next
state convention, which is to ho held
in Spartanburg May 1. 2. .1. l'.?17. It
is the desire of the Spartanburg people
to come up to the standard set
by Charleston in May of this year,
when 1,120 registered delegates were
entertained hv the Charleston people
at the thirty-ninth annual convention.

Charleston Jury Fails to Agree.
Charleston.?After being out nearly
24 hours the jury in the Urown ease,
which opened in the court of general
sessions, was discharged. Judge Rice
ordering a mistrial. The jury retired
Saturday at 7 p. m. with tho evidence
in this first "election case."
At 11:80 o'clock it had not reached
agreement and was locked up to
spend the night in tho court house.
When It was soon Sunday afternoon
that there was no hope of agreement
Judge Rice ordered a mistrial.
Men of both factions in municipal
politics were on the Jury in about
oquai proportions.
Solicitor Henry would make public
no inkling of his plans as to the other
12 election cases pending and which
he came here specially to prosecute.
It is probable, however, that failure
to secure a verdict in the llrown case
may mean a postponement of the
others to another term.
