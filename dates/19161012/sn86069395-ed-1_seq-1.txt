Wisdom of Telling Germany of
Operations So Close to
U. S. Discussed.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 11.
President Wilson and Secretin' of
State Lansing conferred at Shadow
Lawn today on German submarine
attacks on merchantmen Sunday off
the New England coast
It was indicated by officials that
facts so far collected through govern
memai agencies nave uiscioscu no
reasons for drastic action by the Unit
ed States government' of the acts
themselves. No ridence has been
found that international law was vio
lated by the German submarines. It
was indicated however, that the pres
ident and Secretary Lansing discuss
ed the wisdom of pointing out to Ger
many the inadvisability of operating
her submarines in close proximity to
the territorial waters of the United
States.
The presence of a submarine of un
determined nationality off Tybee bar
below Savannah was reported to cus
tom house efficials and to the British
consul. Officials at both the local
custom house and consulate refused
to say where their information came
from; both emphasized the statement
that it was "entirely unofficial." No
American undersea boats are believ
ed to be in these waters.

Wonderfully Pleased 3,000
People.
ROUNDS OF APPLAUSE
Greet His Telling Points In
Speech of an Hour and
a Half.
It is the universal opinion that the
address of Senator Thos. P. Gore, of
Oklahoma, at the Union Tabernacle
Tuesday was the finest political speech
made here in years. The Tabernacle
was well filled, the crowd being esti
mated at more than 3,000, many from
adjacent counties. Hundreds of la
dies were in attendance and showed a
deep interest in the issues of the cam
paign.
Senator Gore was introduced by
Col. W. R. Howell in a few eloquent
and chosen words. He took his place
by the side of a small table, upon
which he laid his cane and launched
at once into a discussion of the won
derful achievements of the Demo
cratic Administration of Woodrow
Wilson. He spoke for an hour and a
half, closing with a peroration of the
purest eloquence in which he describ
ed the blessings of peace due to,Pres
ident Wilson's wise leadership.
Senator Gore's speech was devoid
of all bitterness or rough, language,
but on the other hand vps freely
punctuated by a keen sarcasm and
humor that drove home the points he
made. Many times he grew eloquent,
especially so when picturing the des
olation, woe and sacrifices of Europe
on account of the terrible war and re
versing the picture he showed the
peace, prosperity and happiness ex
isting in the United States.. His re
view in tiie record of the Democratic
party for three and a half years was
one unanswereable argument after
another in favor of Wilson. His
speecii tilled Democrats with the ut
most confidence, and the rounds of
applause were frequently joined by
Republicans.

Standardizing a Single
Breed of Poultry in
Club Work.
In
WHITE WYANDOTTES
Adopted And Nearly 1,100
Pure Bred Stock Raised
During the Past Season.
Mr. A. S. Chapin, who lias been in
charge of the poultry work in this
county, an official of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, spent three days in
the county, making a final inspection
of the clubs in the county. On Mon
day he visited the club at Casky, on
Tuesday those at Hcrndon, Bennetts
town, Lafayette and Howell, and
yesterday those at Pembroke and
Edwards' Mill.
Mr. Chapin was accompanied by
Mrs. Eloisc Graves, the local agent of
the Boys' and Girls' Clubs, on all of
these trips. He did not complete the
visits, but will return to the ccunty
the last week in October to finish.
Mr. Chapin is enthusiastic over the
work done here. The Christian
county White Wyandotte association
was organized early this year and
co-operated with the local agent in
the work. The White Wyandotto
breed was selected to be standarized
and the boys and girls entered with
qrithusiasminto the work assigned to
them. Mr. Chapin says Christian
county was the first county to adopt
one breed and the success attained
has been remarkable. "Christian
county was the pioneer in standard
izing a single breed and the ex?t rl
ment has been watched all over 'he
country with the greatest interrt
In the various clubs organized r ro
there were.90 members, the nun cr
having been swelled from CO .s at
first proposed. Of these only 8 s,:
ceeded in procuring White Wyan
dotte eggs from reliable breeders.
In a few instances breeders supplied
eggs that failed to come up to repre
sentation. These of course re
known to Mr. Chapin and will not be
allowed to impose uoon other r" ?.
dren in further experiments.
Of the 80 children who started, 77
sent in their first reports and C8 sent
in the second reports. Creditable
compositions on Poultry management
wcre written by 25 of the number.
The total number of eggs distributed
by Mrs. Graves was 2,072 and out of
this total there are now 1,072, or more
than 50 per cent, of living chickens,
prospering and many of the pullets
now laying. Of the 2,078 eggs sent
out, only 1884 were reported on.
Forty-one of the children showed a
total of 1C0 pullets and cockerels at
the county fair September 1st, a very
early date.
