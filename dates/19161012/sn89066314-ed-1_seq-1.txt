THE CALENDAR
"The University library should not
and cannot take the place ot a public
library in Columbia. A public library
In Columbia should be supported by
taxation. Our library system has de
veloped to the same stage as our
school system. It is an educational
institution and should be supported
V' as such.
"The University library should not
be expected to perform the service of
a Columbia public library. If such a
one is established here you will find
that almost as many students as Co
lumbia people will patronize it. Cities
near the largest universities in the
country have magnificent libraries and
Columbia .should follow their ex
ample." Jlr. Ilostick, president of the Mis
souri Library Association this after-
noon urged that the citizens of Co
lumbia form a library organization
and exhibit such enthusiasm that no
one would doubt the ultimate success
of the movement. He stated at the
afternoon session of the association
that Mr. Carnegie would be only too
glad to furnish funds for the erection
of a building for the organization.
"Get the movement started with the
whole community behind it," he said,
"and the rest will be easy. A library
supported by taxation is the only
sound method."

Supplying books for rural communi

cussion at this morning's session of
the Missouri Library Association.
Miss Elizabeth B. Wales, secretary of i
the Missouri Library Commission, told
of the work of the commission. "Trav
eling libraries, containing a selection
of books, are sent to communities all
over the state. The schools, certain
town organizations, or a number of

P. H. Hopkins, one ot the founders
and a charter member of the Mus
kogee, Okla., Town and Country Club,
in giving his advice to new organiza
tions says:
"If I was asked for advice in a few
woras to any town considering a
country club I would merely say,
'start something.' Have something
tangible to work on and the other
problems may easily be solved as they
present themselves."
The country club situation in Co

everyone is waiting for some group to
"start something." The sentiment Is
favorable towards it and there is no

COPENHAGEN, Oct. 12. King Ot

An average of $28.50 spent with
each of eleven Columbia merchants
during the first two days of Trade
Week is the result shown from the
slips turned in at the Missourian of
fice for railroad refund up to 6 o'clock
last evening. This is estimated to be
about one-fourth of the amount spent
during the first three days, as the re
bate slips turned in show that the
people from cities from which Trade
Week has drawn shoppers have not
yet finished their purchasing.
The slips turned in show that the
people drawn to Columbia by the rail
road fare refund are not making sin
gle purchases. Mrs. W. R. Baldwin
of Rocheport visited seven stores in
making purchases amounting to $36.
25, one day and came back and spent
$26.85 the next day. Practically ev
ery shopper made over one purchase,
the things bought ranging from mil
linery and wearing apparel to hard
ware and pictures.
"I'm not through buying, cither,"
said Mrs. Baldwin after her first
day's shopping. "I expect to come
back several more times before the
week is over. All my neighbors are
planning to come later in the week.
I think this is the greatest thing the
Columbia merchants and the Missou
rian have ever done for the city and
the people in the small towns nearby.
It shows that they are interested in
our trade and are trying to cater to
us."
Not only are the visiting shoppers
spending money in more than one
store each, but they are making far
larger purchases than are usually
made when no such inducement as
Trade Week offers, is set forth. Sam
Johnson of Easley purchased $17.25
worth of shoes new ones for the
whole family at one store this morn
ing. "As soon as I read about Trade
Week in the Missourian I decided to
take advantage of the opportunity to
save my fare by getting us all some
new shoes," said Mr. Johnson when
he applied at the Missourian office for
his rebate this morning. "The mer
chants of Columbia arc to be com
mended for this move to bring out-of-town
trade to Columbia."
Persons taking advantage of the re
fund should remember to make every
purchase count. The merchants are
