Shore 1s the Hero
If was the work of a tall youth from
South Carolina who was responsible
for the swan-song of the Robins In
Boston town today. This tall youth,
who extends up Into the ethereal
waves a distance of 6 feet S Inches,
toyed with the Brooklyn batters this
afternoon. ; Throughout the nine In
nings he was using his fast ball, which
had a noticeable break to It, and only
three singles were made off his de
" .livery... These singles were as scat
tered as Jcetergs In the middle of the
Atlantic, and Brooklyn never had' a
t Jhance from the time that the umpire

ooted the ball, the tall youth from
East Bend did not weaken.
'Brooklyn lost because It could not

chance with the ball coming. down at
them from such a height and curved
In every possible direction. Jae Dan

mered the National "League pitchers
for an average of more than .300, were
as babes before the towering heaver
of the home team.
In four times to bat Daubert did not
once hit the ball out of the Infield,
while Shore fanned Wheat on two oc
casions. The Boston pitcher deserved
' a shutout It was one of his shoots
that got away from Cady which gave
Brooklyn the solitary run, without a
hit being made In that Jnning.
Stengel, Mowrey and Meyers were
the only Brooklyn Matters to hit safe
ly, and the trio of blnglea did not fig
ure In run making. Big EM Pfeffer
.pitched good ball, but his hurling was
. of no avail. Boston hit when runs,
were needed, and the six hits off the
. big pitcher gave the home folks four
runs, which was more than enough
'' to win. ' ' . .": ' -
