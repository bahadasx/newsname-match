Drops Anchor At Newport 17 Days
- From Wilhelmihaven. Subsea
Fighter Brings Mail.
Newport, R. I.Oct. 10.-Seventeen
days f rom Wilhelmahaven
the imperial German submarine
U-53 dropped anchor at Newport
harbor this afterneon.
Almost before the officers of
the American fleet through which
the stranger had nosed its way
had recovered from their sur
prise, she delivered a message
for the German ambassadar,
weighed anchor and left the
harbor, submerging just inside
the three-mile limit. The sub
marine flew tde German naval
flair, and carried a gun cn her
forward deck, while eixht Ur
prdies easily visible u'der her
decks showed she was ready to
fifhr.
Lieutenant-Captain Hans Rooe
said the submarine came to New
port simply to mail to Count von
Bfrnstorff.
The submarine was within
American waters less than three
hour?, assuming e went to fea
when submerged outside the har
bor. Within that time the Ger
man commander (aid a visit to
Rear Admiral Knight and receiv
ed from him the official courtesy
of a visit.
While the formalities were
being exchanged, the British and
French patrol fleet off the coast
was doubtless being warned of
her presence.
Captain Rose's first question
was, "Have you heard from the
Bremen?" and seemed disap
pointed when told "no."
The Associated Press corres
pondent who had been watching
for weeks for the Bremen went
out by motor boat to the subma
rine. After asking about the
Bremen, Captain Rose demanded
h s credentials and then entrusted
to him a letter for Ambassador
BernstorlT to be mailed. The
correspondence was contained in
cne bulky envelope, which should
be at the German embassy to
morrow morning.
The submarine anchored in
the outer harbor two miles down
the bay. No one came ashore,
but a representative of the As
sociated Press was allowed to go
aboard and learn the vessel's
story.
The U-53, in command of
Lieut. Capt. Hans Roee. appear
ed spick and span upon her ar
rival here and looked at if she
had been out only for maneuvers.
Hr commander reported that
he had not aighted any hostile
craft on hi voyage over, adding
that the boat wat plentifully tup
plied with provisions and fuel
and that nothing wou'd be taen
aboard her.
Tie Record Of President Wilson
And Tie Democratic Congress.
Around 20,000,000 happy fire
tides the fathers of America will
gather this night with their un
broken family circle, with their
children upon their kneet ard
their wives by their tide, happy
and prosperous. Contrast this
with the fathers, husbands and
brothers of the Old World dying
in the ditches, with the gloom
and mourning in broken family
circle, where hunger crouchet
and disease treads. If thia be
"evil and vacillating," God pros
per it and teach it to the rulers
of the Old World.

CHUATL'S TRIBUTE TO
PRESIDENT WILSON
Republican's Praise of President
Endorsed by Noted
Editor.
Joseph H. Choate, ambassador
to Great Britain in the McKin
ley and Roosevelt administra
tions, an ex-president of the
American Bar Association, and
long a leader pi the American
bar, and a leading Republican,
writing in the Review of Re
views for January, 1915, paid
high tribute to Wilson's admin
istration's policies growing out
of the war. He said:
"If we can maintain our neu
trality and keep out of this war
and at the same time prove our
selves friendly to all the nations
engaged in it-as I think we
shall under the wise and prudent
conduct of President Wilson
United Siatts will, I believe, not
only be called into consultation
by the war.ir.i r.i'iors, when
they are no longer able to keep
up the fifcht, but will rractically
be atle to dictate the terms of
peace b.tv.ein them, one of
which must, if possible, be an
effectual guarantee against any
future outbreak ot the horrible
spirit of militarism which has
caused the present war.
"And I am encouraged'in thi
belief by reading the recent
message of President Wilson and
the annual reports of the Secre
taries of War and of the Navy,
wnico, taken wgetner, appear
to show a steadfast determina
tion on the part of our Federal
Government to have us prepared
always for effecual self-defense.
which is a necessary condition
of our national existence.
Of course, the end of this
war will tee us by far the most
powerful nation in the world,
and if the policy pointed out by
Secretary Daniels is pursued, we
shall perhars in the fullness of
time become ourselves fie nil
tress of the seas without incur
f t . . M
ing nosiiniy or attack irom acy
nauon. and shall be the great
factor of preserving universal
peace.
Commenting editorially on Mr.
Choate's letter, the editor of
the Review of Reviews says
fcureiy, mere is no more ap
proved friend of international
peace in our country than the
Hon. Joseph II. Choate. Read
then, what he writes in this
numoer oi toe review on our
need of efficient means of nation
al .defense, lie is in perfect
agreement with what President
Wilson has set forth in his mes
aage to Congress of Deoember 8.
For our part, President Wilson's
worda seem statesmanlike and
noble. They are wholly compat
tbie with Btnct and emcient at
tention to the business of getting
the best results out of the vast
expenditures for army and aavy
mat are met by taxpayers."

People Should Be More Careful.
The Illinois Central Railroad
Company in doing all it can to
educate the people who cross its
tracks over any of the thorough
fares of our country to be more
careful and before they undertake-to
cross the trackt they
should "stop, look and listen.
There are too many serious
accidents happening all over the
country and nearly all of them
are brought about by the care
lessness of the people who cross
these railroad trackt.
If the people will only educate
themselves to the importance of
looking out for trains before
they cross the tracks, it will only
be a short time until there will
be no accidents along railroad
tracks.
We have paid some attention "
to these things for several years
and it is a very rare occasion
that death or a serious accident
would occur along the railroad
trackt if the people would onlv .
"stop, look and listen" before
they undertake to cross.
The railroad company under
stands this and the people had
juntas well understand it; if they
tre not more careful, more
deaths and more accidents than
ever will continue to occur.
We know our roads are getting
better and the facilities are
much greater for travel than,
they used to be, and people take
leat precautions, but the fact
rmaint, they must take m.we
care or there will be more acci
dents. If the people will be as.
careful at the railroads are, ser-.
ions accidents will very seldom
occur. Messenger
