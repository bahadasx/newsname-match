New York, Oct. 11. The Boston
American! drew one notch nearer to
t)je world'l championship here thin
afternoon, when they defeated the
Brooklyn Nationals fi to 2 in the
fourth gam of the scries, which now
M inda three to one In favor of Boston,
TomorMW ths conflict will lie renewed
at Bra Vflt field, Hoston. Columbufl
day tomorrow Is a legal holiday in
Massachusetts und the indications
notnl to an enormoiiH attendance.
With today's contest the players
ceased to participate in the financial
return.
The manner in which the Boston
tore into Hi, Hrooklyn team here thi
afternoon left no doubt as to their In
tention of ending the series as quickly
as possible. Pitcher Leonard gave the
Nationals a two-run lead in the open
ing inning, hut his teammates more
thin iin.de up the handicap in the
second session and once In the van,
refused to permit Hrooklyn to creep
up on them. Today was the first time
since the initial game against the
Philadelphia Nationals In the series
..f I'llf, that Huston has won from Its
rivals by a murgain of more than one
run.
The contest, although featured by
several sensational ploys, did not rise
much above the average of u regular
season contest. Once leona'd swung
Into forn the I'.ooklyn hatters found
it Impossible to score. LMUt, slashing
hitH ripped off the hats of the Hos
lniis in l.e charged against the account
.f Brooklyn pitchers, while splendid
catches, stops and throws made the
way easy for Leonard.
ranv Hopes Ireland
The Hrooklyn club gave its support
ers greet hopes of repeating the vic
tory of Tuesday when tw,, runs were
put over In the first inning on .lolin
Iton'l triple, Myers' single, n base on
belli and an error l.y Janvrln, who, In
hi:; SfgerneeS to get Myers at the
plate, fumbled Cutshaw's grounder.
Kuhe Manpiard, Manager Robinson's
selection for a second try against the
Boston better, held Hoston In the in
itial inning, but (lurdner took much
of tlic mystery out of his delivery
when he hammered out a home run,
his second In two days, with two on
bases. In the next inning Marquard
walked HoblltSell, the first man up,
and Lewis advanced him to third with
double to the light field wall. (lard
Der then cleaned up with his homer,
a drive to deep center.
Hoston added another tally in the
fourth when Lewis singled, went to
second on Oardner's sacrifice, and
scored on Manager Carrlgan's single.
Another wus added in the fifth
when Cheney passed Hooper, who
si, ile second and scored on Hobllt
seil's double. The final run of the
tame came in the seventh. Janvrin,
second up, forced Hooper, who had
singled, went to second on Walker s
Sacrifice and scored when HoblltSell
grounded to Cbsney, whose throw to
Hist hit the runner.
Keeker Goes to Mound,
Cheney was soon ufterwards re
placid by Nap Itucker, one of the
greatest of southpaws when at the
height of his career. Hucker, pitching
with great dellberateness and wide,
Weeping curves, held the Hostonians
SCOreleei to the end. In the two In
nings he held command he funned
three of the six hatters that faced him
and allowed but one hit. f the four
pitchers In the game, Leonard's work
w"s the best. He allowed but five
hits in nine innings, struck out three,
gavt. four bases on bulls, and made
one wild pitch. Hoston got ten hits
off Brooklyn's three pitchers for a
total ,.f fifteen bases, while Hrooklyn
secured five hits for eight buses.
Hooper made the only hase steal of
the day and Hoston used but nine
Play.rs to the home club's fifteen.
Notwithstanding the perfect weather
eid Brooklyn's victory of the preced
ing day, the stands showed many va
cant seats, although the attendance
was a trifle larger than on Tuesday.
The official figures showed that 2 1 . C '.
