The Lyceum Festival.
Last week McConnellsburg and
vicinity en joyedits second annual
Lyceum Festival. For three days
lovers of good entertainment rev
eled in afternoon and evening
feasts of music, lectures, skillful
Performances of tricks with va
rious objects, exhibits of wonder
ful vocal training, etc., to an ex
tent that can be secured only
through organized effort. Every
act of the visiting entertainers
was clean and wholesome .and
1'fted the hearer or observer to a
higher plane of living. These
Rifted artists brought with them
Rlimpses of those better things
intended to cheer us. It is right
that we should break the monot-
ony of everyday life by attend
ance upon such occasions. Did
you notice how every performer
smiled and endeavored to enthuse
you with the uplifting impulses
they tried to interpret? It is their
f'e business to refresh their aud
ences, and we think they sua
eeeded to a verv aonreciable ex
kit. The effect was much more
than mere entertainment, it was
e'evating.
The return nf Hia festival in
"917 has been assured by twenty
seven men and women who Bigned

flenses and salaries of the Lyceum

Fatal Accident
On Monday morning, of this
week, while Talmage Barton, of
Brush Creek township, was on
his way to Everett with a load of
lumber, he fell from the wagon
and the heavy vehicle passed
over his body, killing him almost
instantly. It is thought that he
was seized with a spell of sick
ness which caused him to fall off
the wagon. Funeral was held
Wednesday, interment at Akers
ville. Mr. Barton was aged about
25 years, and leaves a wife, and
one child about four months old
He is also survived by his par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. Isaac M.
Barton, near Crystal Springs.
The tragic death of this young
friend and neighbor has saddened
the hearts of many, and the
young wife has the sincere sym
pathy of all her friends.
Anto Thieves.
One day last week, three young
men stopped at Jeff Harris's res
taurant for a meal. Taking ad
vantage of an opportunity to get
away without paying for it, the
three jumped into their car and
headed for Chambersburg. Jeff
wired to the police of that town
and they arrested the men and
held their car as security. The
three then left town on a trolley
car and went out to McKnights
town and stole a Ford car from
a Mr. Walters and continued
their journey. They left a suit
case in Chambersburg which was
filled with fine shirts and ties be
lieved to have been stolen. The
car in which they passed through
here, and which the police held
in Chambersburg, proved to bo a
stolen car, taken from a man in
Hamilton county, Ohio.
Died From Paralysis.
A clipping from a Cambria
county paper sent to us contains
an account of a recent fresh out
break of infantile paralysis in
Cambria and Somerset counties.
Among the victims was the fami
ly of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Mc
Clain whose little daughter An
na aged 18 months, died of
that dreaded malady. The clip
ping was not dated, but we think
the d.eath occurred Saturday Sep
tember 30th. Mr. McClain was
formerly from Taylor township,
this county. He is now a resi
dent of Wilmore, Cambria coun
ty, Pa. Mr. and Mrs. McClain's
Fulton county friends will deep
ly sympathize with them in their
bereavement.
Celebrated Golden Wedding.
Monday evening, October 9th,
Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester B. Wool
let, of McConnellsburg, celebrat
ed the fiftieth anniversary of
their wedded life. Many friends
of the bride and groom labored
all day 'Monday until the large
rooms down stairs, the hallway
and stairway were converted in
to a real forest of foliage. Great
garlands of roses and other flow
ers, the gifts of friends, were
placed in every nook and corner.
A bride's bower was erected in
the parlor, and here Mr. and
Mrs. Woollet received one hun
dred and twenty-five guests of
the evening.
At a proper time, the bride
and groom, attended by the
groom's sister, Mrs. A. A. Hais
to, of Fannettsburg, -and Judge
S. L. Buckley, of Fort Littleton,
were seated in the dining room
at a table draped in gold and cov
ered with flowers, and the guest3
were comfortably seated about
them. Rev. J. L. Yearick then
invoked Divine pleasure for the
occasion, and an elaborate feast
of substantial and dainties fol
lowed. Toast master Hon. John P.
Sipes then took the floor and
made a brief address which was
followed by many responses from
the representatives of the sever
al professions present. Guests
were then shown a table covered
with splendid gifts of golden
ware brought by loving friends
of the bride. In addition, she
was presented with $80 in real
gold coin of the Realm a joint
purse from friends.
Out of the eighty-seven guests
present at their wedding in Hu3
tontown on October 9, 1SC6, but
five are living, namely. The
bride's maid, Lizzie Chesnut, of
Cumberland, Md., too feeble to
attend last Monday's celebration.
The other four are Mrs. A. A.
Haiston, of Fannettsburg, Judge
S. L. Buckley, of Fort Littleton;
Henry C. Miller, of Clay Centre,
Kansas; Mrs. Margaret Shore of
White City, Kansas. Mr. Nevin
Kirk, is the only present citi
zen of Hustontown who was liv
ing in that town at the time of
the wedding in 18G6.
The bride and groom's first
home wa3 in Clay township,
Huntingdon county five years.
They then lived in Mt. Union one
year, Lockhaven one year, and
in the fall of 1875 they again
removed to Mt. Union, and in
1876, where they took charge of
the American House in that place
until the year 1880 when they
removed to McConnellsburg and
engaged in hotel keeping in the
well known Washington House.
In August 1897, Mr. Woollet be
came postmaster in McConnells
burg, a position held by him un
til April 1915, a period of 17
years and 8 months.
About two years ago, Mrs.
Woollet experienced her first
serious sickness. It soon became
evident that she could no longer
attend to the arduou? duties of
hotel keeping, and she dismissed
her boarders and retired to pri
vate life. Husband and wife are
now enjoying reasonable good
health, and if the good wishes of
departing friends last Monday
evening could De realized, Mr
and Mrs. Woollet will live to eel
ebrate their diamond wedding.
May it all come true.
Among the guests from-a dis
tance on Monday night were at

BOASTFUL IGNORANCE.
Little Talks oa Health and Hygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, 01. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
The boastfulness of ignorance
is ordinarily not worthy of com
ment but when it jeopardizes the
health of other people it is per
haps worth while to take up the
cudgels.
There is a class of individuals
who poh hob all warnings regard
ing matters of hygiene and usu
ally end their assertions by in
forming you that their grand
fathers never paid any attention
to "such nonsense" and what's
more, they never have, and here
they are alive and well to show
for it. Statistics however, show
that these people who violate the
laws of Nature often meet an
untimely death. Unfortunately,
some give an ear to such foolish
boasting and run headlong into
danger.
The transmission of disease by
germs is most frequently attack
ed by the ignorant. Those peo
ple who accept without comment
the statement that the world re
volves upon its axis as a part of
the solar system, and thousands
of other things which they are
incompetent to work out for
themselves, will bluster about
the absurdity of germs causing
disease. That typhoid fever, diph
theria, yellow fever, tuberculo
sis, anthrax, malaria, and pneu
monia are caused by germs has
been proven just as definitely as
the fact that, the world is round.
Fortunately exposure to dis
ease, even of a communicable
type doe3 not always mean that
the individual so exposed will
contract it. This is the reason
that the boaster
May boast and stay
And live to boast another day.
Yes, We Are Learning.
Dates recently announced for
the farmers' Institute for De
cember, call to mind the many
changes in thought that have ta
ken place within the past ten
years. Within that period near
ly all opposition to so-called book
farming has disappeared. More
men now know the scientific rea
sons why the soil of gardens hold
moisture better than the average
field soils. Many men know
which one of the four soil medi
cines to prescribe for his field, or
what combination of the four.
Exactly as a doctor looks at a pa
tient, feels his pulse, and makes
him stick out his tongue, so do
farmers now look at the growing
crops, note their color, vigor and
productiveness and thereby make
no mistake in the application of
the proper medicine when such
is needed. Four and only four
soil medicines need be kept in
mind by the farmer, while the
physician to our bodies must re
member scores of remedies.
What brought this great
change? The answer i3" simple.
Men ofmvestigating minds, some
on farms, and some at our ex
perimental stations, looked for
them Sand then told it to the
world through their books, lect
ures, institutes, &c, until many
now have a fair knowledge of soil
needs. By all means, got ready
to attend the institutes at Enid,
McConnellsburg, and Needmore.
They Haie Merry.
A communication intended for
last week reached us on publica
tion day too late to be used. It
was the effect that thirty-six
friends of Amos Barker and fam
ily, of Bethel township, surprised
them on October , 1st by calling
in a body, bringing baskets and
boxes of good things to eat and
relieve the hostess of all work of
preparing dinner. That Sunday
will remain a day of pleasant re
collection in which friendships
were renewed and strengthened
ed. Mrs. Mary Peters and son, of
York, were recent visitors, in the
home of Mrs. James Connelly,
near Dana.
Auto Accident on Mountain.
On Thursday evening of last
week, Dr. and Mrs. C. C. Crouse,
of Derry, Pa., were descending
the west side of Cove mountain.
A short distance above the first
stone wall below the top, they
drew to one side to let a heavy
car get ahead of them, and the
Doctor did not notice how close
he was to the sharp curve in time
to avoid dropping over the wall,
and the Ford car in which they
were traveling shot out into space
off the road, after hitting and
breaking off one of the guard rail
posts. In some manner unknown
to the.Crouses, they were thrown
clear of the car and landed on the
ground quite a distance below the
road. The Doctor was rendered
unconscious and lay twenty-five
feet from where the car stopped.
His wife was practically unhurt,
except for the severe jar received
when she was thrown out. Mrs.
Crouse saw that her husband was
unconscious, and she at once tried
to climb the wall to get help from
passing cars. Not being able to
reach the road, she could not
make herself heard and several
autos passed. Penally, the driver
of a passing coal auto truck found
them and brought them to town
where Dr. end Mrs. Mosser gave
them shelter for the night. On
the way down the mountain, Dr.
Crouse regained consciousness,
and at Dr. Mosser's office it was
found that his injuries consisted
of cuts about the head, none of
which will prove serious. Mr.
and Mrs. Crouse were returning
home from their wedding trip.
The auto was brought to town on
its own power, and the many
kinks in the body were taken out
at the Cline garage and the tour
ists started home Friday after
noon. Dr. and Mrs. Crouse requested
the News to express for them
their gratitude for the many kind
nesses shown them by all who as
sisted in their rescue.
Resolutions of Respect.
The following resolutions have
been adopted recently by the sur
viving members of the Knobs
ville M. E. Church in regard to
the death of our late brother Da
vid W. Kelso.
Whereas: It has pleased Al
mighty God, in His infinite wis
dom, to call from this church to
that great and Grand Church
Above our beloved brother David
W. Kelso, who took his departure
October 2, 1916, and
Whereas: The intimate and
loving christian relations we held
with him here have thus been
served until we meet with him in
the Great Beyond, we deem it
highly befitting that we should
express our great appreciation
of his noble work and our deep
sense of loss; therefore, be it -v
Resolved: That the removal
of such a noble life from among
us will be deeply felt by all the
officers and members of this
church, therefore, be it further
Resolved: That our sincere
and heartfelt sympathy is here
by extended to his family in th's
hour of bereavement, and that
we commend them to Him, who
alone can give aid and comfort
in times of sorrow when expres
sions of human sympathy are too
weak to heal the broken hearts.
We are not as those who mourn
without hope, and it is our sin
cere hope that even so great a
loss may be overruled for good
by Him who "doth all things
best;'' therefore, be it further
Resolved: That a copy of
these resolutions be sent to the
county papers to be published
and a copy presented to the fam
ily of our deceased brother. By
or of Committee.

Hunters Heavily Fined.
Notwithstanding the many
warnings that illegal hunting
would te punished sooner or la
ter, nearly $100 hard-earned Lick
ing Creek money found its way
into the State Treasury last week
in the shape of heavy fines im
posed on squirrel hunters. $10
and costs for each squirrel is
more than the richest man in
Fulton county can afford to ray
for that kind of fun. But that
is what it costs now to "hog the
season." We have been told
that the worst offenders have not
yet been called to account, but it
is only a matter of time until
they will get theirs, although the
detectives may have to wait un
til next fall. Last week's fines
were only the beginning of a de
termined effort to make all obey
the law. It is not fair that.. a
few should be permitted to kill
game while others wait until the
season opens.
