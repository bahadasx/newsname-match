Aint'i'lcii iis drew one notch mar.
or the world's championship here to
day when they defeated the IUookl.vn
Nationals ti to 2 ill the fourth game.
Of the series, which now stands three
to one in Huston's favor. Tomorrow
the conflict will he renewed at praves1
field, Ronton, where what I tuition
hopes will lo the deciding name will
if played. Cclumhut day is i legal
holiday in Massaclnntei ts and the In
dications point to an enormous at
tondn nee.
With today's contest at F.hhets field
the players teased to participate In
the financial returns. I'.iooklyn rc
fllst :; to he collided out of I lie s.1 i ll m.'lc

and force their opponents lo return in
ltruoklvn where the home team ran
uuike a last desperate stand.
The Milliner In which I he r.ostons
tore into the lirooklyn team tt day left
no douhl as to their intention of end
In the series as quickly as pos.sihlo.
Pitcher "Dutch" Leonard sunt ted t he)
Nationals' two runs In the opening m
tdlig. but his teammates more Hi in
Inade up the handicap In the seeoml
session and once In the van refused to
permit lirooklyn to creep up on them.
Their earnestness In the matter is
shown t.y the fact that today wall the
first time since the "initial gnnio
against the Philadelphia Nationals In
the series of 1 ! 1 5 that the lloston
Amcrliaiis have won from their rivals
ly a niai-Kln of more than one iiiti.
Jusl AImivc Average.
Tlie contest, although featured by
Severn scnsationul plays, -did not rise
M uch above the n ..'rmr.j of u reg'ular
lieason contest. Oneo Leonard swung
Into form the lirooklyn batters found
It Impt Rslhle to push a runner round
tho plate because of the steady twirl
ing of the Fresno. Pal., Iiox-man. who
was finely supported both In the of
fer se and defense by his toiimnintos.
Long slushing hits hlppled off the bats
of HoHton to bo charged against tho
account of Brooklyn's pitchers, while
splendid cntehes, stois and throws
made the way easy for Leonard.
Tho Pronklyn club wive Its sup
porttrs great hopes of repenting the
victory of Tuesday when two runs
were put over In the .'irst Inning on
Johnston's triple, Myers' single, i base
on balls and an error by .Tanvrin. who
In bin eagerness to Bet Mvcrs at the
plate fumbled Cntshuvv's grounder.
Jiuho Murquard, Mimiwr Robinson's
choice1 for a second try against the
ItOFton, staved off the visitors In the
initial Inning, but Gardner took much
of the mystery out of his delivery
when he hammered out a home run,
his second In two days, with two on

WILSON PLUGS

SIX PROMINENT MEN
Its Business Will he to Be
come Rallying Point of
Civic Bodies.
ON lii.AIUi PUKSIDKNTs SPE
CIAL, HAKHISI'.L'KC, Pa., Oct, 11.
President Wilson, en route to Indian
apolis tonight, announced the appoint,
incut of members of the advisory com.
mlsfdon to be associated with tho
council of national defense, floated by
congress at the last 8csHlin. At tho
sumo time he gave out a statement
saying he hoped tho council will "be
come a rallying point for civil bodies
working for the national defense."
The seven members of the new ad
visory commission are Imniel Wlllard,
i resident of the linltimoro & Ohio
railroad; Samuel Oompors, president
of the American Federation of Iibor;
Ir Franklin II. Martin of Chicago;
Howard K. Coffin of Detroit; Hernard
Hunter- of New York; Dr. Mollis God
frey of Philadelphia, and Julius Hos
etnvald of Chicago.
Tho president's statement follows:
"The council of national defonso
created by congress has realized that
the country Is hett prepared for war
Alien thoroughly prepared for peace.
From an economic point of lew there
Is now very little difference between
the machinery required for commer
cial efficiency nnd that roquliod for
military purposes. In both cases the
whole Industrial mechanism must be
organized In the most effective way.
I'pon this conception of the national
welfare the council Is organized In the
words of the act for tlm creation of
relations which will render possible
In tlmo of need the Immediate concen
tration and utilization of the resources
of the nation.
Opens c Channel.
"Tho organization of the council
likewise opens up a new and direct
channel of communication and co
operation between business and scien
tific men and all departments of the
government nnd it Is hoped that It
will in addition becomo a rallylnar
point for civic bodies working for the
national dcfciU'O.
"The council's chief functions are:
"I. The co-ordination of all forms
of transportation and tho development
of means of transportation to meet the
military, Industrial antl (Oiniuerolal
needs id' the nation.
"2. The extension of the Industrial
mobilization work of the committee
on industrial preparedness of the
naval consulting hoard. Complete In
formation as to our present manufac
turing and producing facilities adapt
able to many sided uess of modern
warfare will be procured, analyzed
and mndo use of.
"Ono of the objects of the council
will he to Inform American manufac
turers as to the part which they can
and must play In national emergency.
It Is empowered to establish at once
and maintain through subordinate
bodies of specially qualified persons
an auxiliary organization composed of
men of the best creative and admin
istrative capacity, capable of mobiliz
ing to the utmost the resources of the
country.
"Tho personnel of the council's ad
vlsorv members annolnted without re-
gard to party marks the cntranco of
the nonpartisan engineer and profes
sional man Into American govern
mental affairs on a wider scale than
ever before. It is responsive to the
Increased demand for nnd need of
business organization In public mat
ters and for the presence thorn of the
best t-peclallst-t in their respective
fields. In tho present instance tne
time of some of tho members of the
advisory bonrd could not be pur
chased. Thev serve the government
without remuneration, efficiency be
ing their sole object and Americanism
their only motive."

Shadow Ijtwn
Although the secretary diclined t i

of the raid, particularly the steps
taktn to insure the safety of passen
gtis There was evi-ry evidence that
Secretary Iinsing had gone to set1 the
prtsident more to discurs possible
eventualities and to prepare against
them than with the idea of making a
dt finite decision.
The secretary appeared In unusual
ly good spMts on his return, lie vvas
iMiphalie in declaring that the gov
ernment's attitude would remain un
determined until a complete Investiga
tion had been made, but ho would not
Indicate what Impression he ba.i
gained from the president, with whom
final deel"on rests.
Will Make Haste.
It is emphasized that tho govern
ment Is muking every effort to com
plete its Inquiry as soon as possible,
but that It wants to avoid a hasty or
lll-odlvscd decision in so Important
a matter.
Whether the Oernian commander
took-proper care for the safety of the
persons lie put into small boats from
the attacked vessels, Is a question In
volving mlnts on which officials be
lieve there Is no clear precedent and
no which derision by the I'nited States
might approximate a precedent at
least so far as concerns any further
submarine operations (lermany may
contemplate on this side of the
Atlantic.
Itefore any policy Is determined
upon it is expected that the opinion
of the neutrality board created at the
beginning of the ivir to advise tlie
Htate department In regard to such
questions, will be consulted. The
board was called Into session Im
mediately after tho l'-ho.-it appeared
on this side of the Atlantic and sev
eral meetings have-been held since.
Considerable, interest centers on
the continued silence of the allied
embassies. Again today It. was stated
positively at the st ito department
that no representations of any sort
had been received from tho allies as

had issued orders detaining the llrll
Ish merchant vessels now In American
ports until such a time as it vvas
deemed safe f,,r lliein lo depart.
X'erifleatlons of this report could
not be obtained at the Hritish con
sulate which Issues the final sailing
orders, hut it was admitted that sin h
orders for the Cunaid freighters
Pannonia and St. George, duo to sail
today, had been withheld. The hlg
Whito Star passenger liner Adriatic,
company officials said, will sail at
noon tomtit row.
Additional Drops.
The continued absence of advices
indicating additional submarine activ
ities along tho Atlantic lanes resulted
today in marine insurance rates from
t he high mark struck Monday. Rates
were quoted at '1 'a per cent, a drop
of r.O pt r cent fiom Ihe general quo
tations earlier in Ihe week.
There was a strong tendency in
naval circles today to believe that
the C-."i;t. unless that eiaft lias ic
ceived Iresh fuel supplies on tills slilo
of the Atlantic, has hauled olf sho'-o
and Is headed for her base nt Helgo
land. This belief Is founded on tho
knowledge that the cruising radius of
the C-r.3 class boats tloes not exceed
seven thousand miles.
