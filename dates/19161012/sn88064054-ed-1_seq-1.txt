YOUNG LADY AND P
COMPANION SHOT1
While Standing On Front a
Porch At 945 Ave. 1)
Sunday Evening s
p
Miss Tiney Lott, age about 19 is i,
in the Bogalusa Hospital with p
her face and chest peppered with
birdshot, Oliver Arnold is suffer- i
ing with a wounded arm and Wiley i
Allen is being held in the Parish t
Jail at Franklinton charged witll
shooted the young lady and her c
companion. The shooting occured s
at 945 Ave. D about 8.45 Sunday i
evening and a 'short time after- c
ward Allen was arrested. He claims
that he is innocent of the crime
while the victims state that they I
are positive that he did the shoot- i
ing. 1
Miss Lott is reported to have I
prefered the company of Oliver
Arnold home from church Sunday I
evening in preference to Allen.
They arrived at the Lott home and i
were standing on the front porch
engaging in a conversation when
with little warning both barrells
of a shotgun were emptied at the
young couple. Assistance rushed
to the young couple and soon they
were under medical attention. A
few minutes later the Police were
working on the case and Allen',was
arrested. The police however failed
to find the gun alledged to have
been used by Allen. They believe
that it was hid in the swamp a short
Sdistance from the Lott home.
I While the condition of Miss Lott
t is not reported dangerous it is said
that she will be marked for life as a
result of the shots. Her face was
almost covered with gun shot but
I fortunately none struck her eyes.
rODe tooth was knocked out and
f several shot took effect in the neck
3 and chest. Number 8 shot was
used by the man who fired the shots
which is the only reason that the
I young lady was not killed as the
distance from where the shot was
r fired to where the victims were
standing was less than 25 feet. "
While the wound of Arnold was
very painful it was not considered
serious. Allen claimed his inno
cence but the police state that they
rwill be able to prove he is guilty.
Allen was a member of Company
"G" and this is the first time that
he has been charged with an offense.

send a delegatiop of residents to the
i meeting of the Commission Council

when four commissioners will be

towards deciding upon the new
schools, new city hall. new fire de
partment and jail, as well as extend
ing the water and sewer system and
placing the streets in good condition.
At a special meeting of the Com
mission council Monday afternoon
Mayor Sullivan stated that he
Ithought it would be best to get one
or more citizen from each section
of the city to act on each commis
sion. He was of the opinion that " ,
if live wires were placed on each
commiasson that everything in con
s nection with the improvements
a would result in Bogalasa getting
r 100 cents for every dollar expended
Sas well as comind as near posible 
to pleasing the greatest number of
a tax payers. The location of the
r varibus new improvements, the se
r lecting of architects and all the
I. work connected with various build
I ings will be decided upon by the
i variqus commissions pending the
app al'of the commission council.
s "We ont want any figure heads on
any of these commissions and we
l want the livest wires there are in
y the city" said mayor Sullivan. "We
. will give each section of the city
e any opportunity of selecting their
s own representatives and we hope
d that each section of the city will
e send at least five or six well known
e citizens to the meeting next Monday
t anfternoon and tell'us who they
want from their section to act. There
:t will be -plenty of important work
d for a few weeks and without any
a pay but everything this commission
s accomplishes will be a living monu
t ment to the city as well as to the
. members of the commission."
d At the same meeting there were
k a few Changes ,in the Sewer and
s WaterLBoard. J. B. Lindsley, H. E.
s Baumgarten, D. T. Cushing and
e Jesse Johnson were appointed to

ignation of W. L. Wuescher, W. H.
e Sullivan, J. Y. Sanders, Jr. and
IE. L. Middleton who will serve on
