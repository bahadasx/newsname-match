WOMEN DID NOT RE­
CEIVE THEIR BAR­
GAIN PETTICOATS
Minneapolis Crook Does Nervy Work
Among Women of the Northwest
—Receives Many Dimes
During the past week or two hun­
dreds of letters written by what is
known as the National Order Co.,
Brokerage Building, Minneapolis, of­
fering the women of the Northwest
the unusual opportunity of securing
a silk petticoat for the nominal sum
of ten cents, have been received. Of
course, the offer is too good to be
true, for the skirt is guaranteed to be
worth $4.75, but a number out of cur­
iosity have bitten on the proposition,
which though very small, means that
the concern has received hundreds of
dollars in the aggregate.
The following from the Oct. 3 issue
of the Fanners Dispatch will prove
interesting:
"The Twin City authorities are
searching for a well dressed young
man, who, posing as a district man­
ager of the "National Mail Order
Broker Exchange," collected dimfes
from women throughout the North­
west by promises of a silk petticoat
for every ten-cent piece received with
a list of live friends who had prom­
ised also to take part in the rather
vague "profit-sharing" proposition.
Each of the women wrote five letters
to five friends on the request of the
exchange, bought five two-cent stamps
and mailed the letters and then sent
the exchange 10 cents along with the
names and addresses of the friends to
whom she had mailed the letters.
Within the last week Mayor Nye of
Minneapolis has received letters from
three of the women. They wanted to
know about their silk petticoats. The
police have been unable to find them."
Mrs. O. R. Brown, who resides north
of the city, has been kind enough to
send the Independent the following let­
ter she received from the concern.
Mrs- Brown sent the firm ten cents,
realizing that she would never receive
anything, but she wanted to do what
she could to bring the crooks to jus­
tice. The letter follows:
"You will surely be interested in
the extraordinary gift offer now be­
ing made by the National Order Co.,
Brokerage Bldg., Minneapolis, Minn.,
to universally introduce and adver­
tise ready-to-wear goods in the least
time. We give everyone complying
with the conditions herein stated one
1916 model petticoat, retailing^ at
$4.75. Give size and color desired.
Make five copies of the entire letter
and mail them to five of your lady
friends and send ten cents in silver to
the National Mail Order Co., Broker­
age Exchange, 250 Tabe Bldg., Minne­
apolis, Minn., with the names of the
parties to whom you mailed copies.
You will receive one of these silk pet­
ticoats without further expense. This
offer extends to all who receive this
letter. Act now. Do it without delay

and receive the benefit of this remark­
able advertisement offer. Write names
plainly to guard against errors. Every
skirt has our guarantee."
If the officers can locate the nervy
young man who extracted so many
dimes throughout the country, the
bars of the federal prison will stare
him in the face.
Minot's New Farm Paper is Off the
Press.
The first copy of the Northwestern
Agriculturist to be printed in Minot
under its reorganization, is off the
press and will be mailed out during
the present week. The publication has
a real prosperous appearance, being
well filled with interesting advertise­
ments. The pages are filled with in­
teresting farm news pertaining to the
northwest and the various depart­
ments are well edited. Editors Wig
ham and Pierce have reason to be very
proud of their initial number and im­
provements may be expected from is­
sue to issue. The new journal is de­
serving of success and it ought to find
its way into every farm home in this
great northwest. The publishers are
hard-working, capable men and will
make the journal one of the greatest
in the northwest.

RAIDS THE UNITED
STATES COAST
U-53 Made Trip Across the Atlantic
and Sank Nine Vessels Off
Newport, .1.
One of the large new German war
submarine boats, the U-53, which ar­
rived at Newport, R. I., last Saturday
after a seventeen days' journey across
the Atlantic, departed that evening
and the following day made a raid on
enemy and neutral shipping vessels,
sinking nine of them. The boat has
not been sighted since then, but ship­
ping along the Atlantic coast has been
paralyzed thru fear of another attack.
The raid was made about one hundred
miles off the coast of the United
States and from what can be learned,
the crews were all given an opportun­
ity to leave their vessels, so that no
complications are likely to arise with
the United States.
The U-53 came unheralded and was
piloted into the Newport harbor by
one of our own boats. This is the
first war submarine to make the trip
across the Atlantic and shows what
may be done in case of war with the
United States. Capt. Hans Rose, aged
85 years, allowed a number of our own
naval officers to go on board the sub­
marine. The boat is over 200 feet
long and was in spic and span shape.
The captain said he had plenty of pro­
visions and fuel on board for three
months. He stated that on the way
over the boat was submerged to a
depth of 200 feet for three days, mak­
ing headway under the water at that
depth.

Become Brides of Two Prosperous
Young Farmers.
Judge William Murray officiated at
a double wedding at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Henry Auslander in this city
Wednesday evening at 8 oclock, the
brides being the nineteen-year-old
twin daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Ole
Edahl of Wildrose, N. D., and nieces
of Mrs. Auslander.
The contracting parties were Hjal
mer Haugen and Miss Blanche Edahl
and Oscar O. Redalen and Miss Cora
Edahl. The grooms are steady young
farmers residing near Wildrose and
each is 22 years of age. The brides
are very attractive young women and
as the bridal party took their places
to exchange vows, they presented an
appearance never to be forgotten by
the forty assembled guests. They
wore beautiful gowns of white satin,
made exactly alike, and wore carna­
tions.
A six course dinner was served by
Mrs. Auslander. The guests remained
until the midnight hour and the bridal
couples departed on No. 1 this morn­
ing for Wildrose, where they will
make their future home.
Coyotes Kill Sheep.
Swan M. Lindgren, a prominent
farmer who lives southwest of the
city near the old Jerome postoffice, is
in the city today. He brot in a load of
nine sheep which he sold to the butch­
ers for $55. Mr. Lindgren says the
coyotes are playing havoc with the
sheep, killing seven for Ludvig Vot
lund, his neighbor, and two for him­
self. They have become so bold that
they came right up to Mr. Lindgrens
house, sneaking off with seven chick­
ens. Mr. Lindgren says he believes
the bounty on coyotes ought to be
raised to $5.

"JACK THE PEEPER"
CAUGHT IN MINOT
A. Anderson Caught Boring Holes
Thru Doors at the Leland Hotel
So He Could See Occupants.
J. Anderson was arrested at the
Leland hotel Sunday night charged
with malicious mischief. He was ad­
mitted to $1,000 bail, bonds being fur­
nished by some Granville friends.
Anderson was charged with boring
holes thru the doors between rucms at
the Leland, Waverly and Windsor ho­
tels, so that he could have a "look
see" at the occupants of the rooms.
It is claimed that Anderson was
caught in the act of boring a hole
thru the thin panel of a door, using a
small brace and bit, dust from the
fresh hole that he made being found
on the floor. Holes were found in
seventeen doors at the hotel snd a
number of doors in the Waverly anJ
Windsor hotels were fixed in the same
manner.
^.nderson, it is Understood, reim­
bursed the hotels for the damage done
ana the case was dismissed. He was
veiy reticent concerning the matter
but it's a cinch that he will not play
"Jack the Peeper" very soon again.
Scheme to Raise Fund Among P. M.'s.
Republicans claim to have made the
discovery of an effort on the part of
democrats to collect a campaign fund
from the 65,000 postmasters of the
United States of ten per cent of their
salaries for a Wilson compaign fund.
They clam that the democratic nation­
al committee has taken the matter up
with the chairmens of the various
county organizations. The attempt
was made by means of a circular ad­
dressed to the county chairmen by R.
BOnna Ridgeway, of Texas, member of
the finance committee, it is claimed.
Chairman McCormick admitted that
the letters had been issued but that
their distribution had been stopped.

Former Mail Clerk Sentenced by Judge

Jacob Schwirtz, former mail order

Bv winning the world's series from the National league chammons the Boston Red Sox gathered in the world's championship for the American league twice in succession. Last year they turned
the trick bv defeating the Philadelphia Nationals four games to one. It was the first time since 1910-11 that a team won the world's championship twice succession. The honors went to the Philadel
nhia Americans, the famous Athletics, in those years. The record for world's championships won in a row goes to the old Chicago Cubs, the marvelous machine whose work in winning three times in a
row in 1906, 1907 and 1908 is remembered by all fans. This year's Red Sox team is not as strong as last year's, having lost Speaker, the wonderful center fielder, who is now with the Cleveland Indians.
a shortage in Schwirtz's accounts of
something over $8,000 and the fine
imposed was supposed to make up this
shortage and the cost of the trail.
When asked whether he had anything
to say before sentence was passed, the
defendant stood up before the judge
and looking him squarely in the eye
stated that he was not guilty of tak­
ing a cent of Uncle Sam's money.
Through his attorney, John E. Greene,
M. Schwirtz has appealed and his ar­
guments will be heard in St. Paul in
June. He was admitted to $10,000
bail, his bondsmen and bail being the
same as before the trial.
Mr. Schwirtz visited the Independ­
ent office shortly after he had received
his sentence and appeared very confi­
dent that he would secure a new trial
and that ultimately he will be found
not guilty.
"I do not contend that anyone else
has taken the money, for I feel that
the whole thing is a grave mistake. I
do not believe that the government is
short a cent and I feel that I will be
able to prova it."
Schwirtz was employed at the Minot
postoffice for about ten years and he
has a host pf friends in this section of
the state who still believe him innocent'
of any crime. His habits have always
been the very best. He was a hard
working, economical man and one who
would never have been suspected of
doing anything the nature of the,
charge that was filed against him.

Former Police Matron Becomes Bride
of George Turner Porter, Prom­
inent Richey, Mont., Rancher
The marriage of Miss Eleanor Mar­
shall, who gained considerable prom­
inence as police matron of the city of
Minot to George Turner Porter of
Richey, Mont., occurred at the home of
the bride's aunt, Mrs. A. Bell, on Fifth

o'clock Wednesday evening. The cere­
mony was performed by Rev. P. W.

mediate relatives of the bride. The
happy couple left on No. 1 over the
Great Northern for the west this
morning and they will be at home to
their friends at Richey, Mont., where
Mr. Porter has extensive ranching in­

host of friends. During the past year
or two she had charge of the recre­
ation work at the United Charity

which is regarded as the model camp
of the country.
Howard Huston, who spent several
weeks on business in Alaska, is now at
Pullman, Wash., where he is engaged
in lecturing.

NEXT GOVERNOR OE
STATE 10 ADDRESS
CITIZENS
Lynn J. Frazier to Speak at Big Non­
partisan Meeting at Sons of Nor­
way Hall Monday, October 16
A big nonpartisan meeting will be
held at the Sons of Norway building
in this city on Monday evening, Oct.
16, at which time Lynn J. Frazier, re­
publican nominee for governor, and
other prominent nominees will speak.
This will afford an excellent oppor­
tunity for the people of this section of
the state to "size up"- North Dakota's
next chief executive, for it is gener­
ally conceded that Mr. Frazier and
practically every other nonpartisan
nominee will be elected.
John N. Hagen of Deering, candi­
date for commissioner of agriculture,
P. N. Casey, the democratic nonparti­
san nominee for treasurer, and E. A.
Bowen of Fargo, one of the league
speakers, will deliver addresses dur­
ing the evening. It will be the big­
gest rally for nonpartisan league sup­
porters and Equity boosters ever held
in this section of the state.
Mr. Frazier less than a year ago
was pursuing the even tenor of his
way on his farm near Hoople, N. D.
He was a man who took an interest in
the public affairs in his own communi­
ty, but he never thought for a minute
that he would ever become the chief
executive of his state. Although he
had received a college education, he
had never done much public speaking
and during the early part of the cam­
paign he found some difficulty in ex­
pressing his views from the platform.
He has developed into quite a public
speaker, however, and his address will
be heard with a great deal of interest.
A large number of nonpartisans will
be on hand to escort Mr. Frazier from
the train. The first speaker will be­
gin his address at 8 o'clock.
Mr. Frazier will speak at Sawyer
at 2 p. m., Oct. 16, at Berthold Oct.
17, at 2 p. m., and at Crosby at 8 p.
m., Oct. 17.
SHEEP RAISING PROFITABLE.
Bottineau, N. D., Oct. 10.—Arne
Moen, of Deep, is one of the few Bot­
tineau county farmers who has given
sheep raising a fair trial and he has
made a decided success.
Four years ago he bought 125
breeding ewes in Montana for $400
and turned them loose on some waste
land along the river, where they were
given little attention. Since buying
them he has sold wool for between
$800 and $1,000 and last week sold
350 head, raised from the original
flock, for $2,370.
Freight Wreck Near White Earth.
The engine of a freight train a short
distance west of White Earth jumped
the track, taking with it and piling up
seventeen freight cars. The trains
were delayed 12 hours until the wreck­
age could be cleared away.
