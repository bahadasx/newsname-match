An OldTime Darke Coun
ty School Master.
BY ISAAC KAY, M. D.
The writer of the following
sketch wishes to premise that in
his ninth year he was brought
from his native home in the Cum
berland Valley, Pennsylvania, to
West Alexandria, Ohio, in the
autumn of the year .1836, where,
mi the 4th day of November, 1837,
h was rendered fatherless. His
residences in Darke county, Ohio,
were intermittent and quite var
iable, extending from the year
1840, when the county had a pop
ulation ofl3. 145, until the year
1845.
When only a boy, the writer of
this article attended a country
school a mile east of Ithaca; Ohio,
and near a soot now called Gor
don, Darke county. The teacher
wis an exceedingly eccentric,
middb-ated personaere, who
proudly styled himself, "Paul
Chase of the State f New York. "
The first time that I ever saw
him was on the day after the Oc
tober state election of 1842. near
ly 74 years ago, when he appeared
upon the streets of our village,
- exultmgly reciting the words of
n political campaign song then in
vogue, commencing with the line
""Wilson Shannon has given a
tanning to Tom the Wagon Boy."
; In this song the then ex-Governor
Thomas Corwin, of great dis
tinction, was meant.
The writer was then living in
Ithaca and Mr. Chase had taught
. in several of the nearby, villages,
r where' his services were highly
- esteemed. ; But he would occas
ionally take a day off, especially
r; jpf J-aturdays,'vat wpich times he
would stir up the people in and
about the towns of Lewisburg,
West Baltimore, New, Castine,
and Ithaca with his progressive
notions and original ways of ex
pressing them. Mr. Chase's me
thods of teaching might well be
considered first class, even in this
day of public schools. Like his
neighb o r ho o d co-temporaries,
Findlay Moore and James Grimes,
he sometimes taught in the vil
, lages, but mostly in the rural dis
tricts, often boarding around at
the homes of the scholars. He
was kind in his manner, firm,
strict in enforcing discipline and
thorough in his course of instruc
tion. The complete circle of the
sciences as taught by him was
fitly represented by the mystic
number seven, to-wit : The alph
abet, spelling, reading, writing,
arithmetic, grammar "and geog
raphy. Hickory and beech would
., have increased the curriculum,
but the i pioneer school masters
generously threw these branches
in gratis, so they were not count
ed in the regular list of studies.
It was the theory of some that a
dull and inattentive boy's lessons
should be illustrated now and
then with a few lively woodcuts
The pupil would thus be made to
remember the illustrations if not
the text.
Mr. Chase called t;he pupils' at
tention to the principles of. or
thography, ortheopy, grammati
cal rules and elegant composi
tion. The principles of analysis,
both in grammar and in arithme
tic, were mo&t ably inculcated.
which was quite an item in those
, early days and a ne v departure
in the usual course of rural edu
cation. One of the singularities
of this method was that he taught
the art of spelling not so much by
roteas by observing the system
atic rules of orthography fully
, as the structure of the English
language would anow. tie paid
close attention, not only to the
mere letter of the rules in arith
metie and grammar, but to the
essential principles upon which
these rules were based , and he
delighted in considering what
mignt be termed the philosophy
of numbers and of language.
Mr. Chase was himself a fine
speller, reader, elocutionist ard
arithmetician. If a word of what
ever unsettled orthography or
ortheopy were given out to him
he would immediately and from
memory give the correct spelling
and pronunciation as taught, by
Walker first and then Webster,
Worcester, Elphinston, Johnson
and other leading lexicographers
of England ard America. He
was a liberal patron and attend
ant upon nearly ?11 the spilling
matches and debating societies in
the neighborhood and invariably
made it lively for all concerned.
The writer remembers one es
pecially pleasing and profitable of
Mr. Chase's every day exercises
at school. It was a general re
hearsal, in concert by all the
scholars, big and little, nt the
close of each afternoon session.
This exercise lasted about fifteen
minutes atid consisted in asking
questions by the teacher and anf
wer in chorus by the children.
Many of the scholars wave from
six to fourteen years of age and
had been thoroughly drilled" upon
this program until they could
answer everything with prompt
ness and vim. - The first question
was "What are the sipns of the
Zodiac?'' Answer by the school:
k'They are twelve. . Aries, Taur
us, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,
Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn us,
Aquarius and Pisces." Then
would follow a variety of set
questions and corresponding ans
wers, upon -mathematical, physi
cal, descriptive and political ge
ographyV embracing, the earth's
daily and annual movements and
its various astronomical relations
to the solar system, its natural
and political divisions, together
with the capitals of all the states
and nations in the world. Then
followed questions and answers
on the tables of weights and mea
sures, divisions cf time, principal
eyents in the world's history and
many maxims and rules of prime
importance in practical life.

Mr. Chase was a great reader
of poetry and fiction, although
he never attempted to write
write a single page of either. He
claimed that poets' were born and
not made such, and that a ' 'man
no more could make himself a
poet, than a sheep can make it
self a go-at.'' His readings in
the field of light literature were
confined generally to the more
meritorious authors, both modern
and ancient. H;3 advice in the
selection of books was always to
take the best, for it took no more
time to read a worthy book than
it did to read an inferior one.
Mr. Chase had intense adm'ra
tion lor what ne regarded as
first-class authors, and' a most
decided aversion, amounting to
unjust and. unreasonable preju
dice, against certain others. In
these respects he was in many
particulars most decidedly old
fogy even for his time. His fav
orite dictionary was Walker, with
some tolerance for Worcester,
against all the rest then in use,
The most invidious comparisons
were made in favor of Murray as
against Kirkham in. grammar; in
favor of the English Introduction
Reader and Sequel as against
what lie termed the follies of
McGuffeys; and in favor of Ad
am's Analytic Arithmetic, Talbot
and other prominent arithmetics
of that day. But to say Samuel
Kirkham or B. F, Ells as gram
marians to .him was like shaking
a red rag at a cross bull. It would
invariably - elicit criticisms
were ironical af d sarcastic.
that
His
arraignment of faulty authors,
especially of school' books, weie
fairly cyclonic, ana yet ."hY was
an amiable man
Mr. Chase had a powerful phys
ical organization, weighing about
two hundred pounds, qnd com
pactly built Two of his most
noted characteristics, physical
and intellectual, were the immen
sity of brain and his power of
memory. He $ ould scarcely ever
get a ready-made hat that was
large enough for fcim to wear.
He required a number eight and
a quarter hat, and always had to
get one manufactured over a
special block. One day he came
into our village store and called
for a new hat. The merchant
laughingly replied that he Jiad
the very tHig to suit him. It
was a number eight plug hat,
and was several sizes too large
for any customer who had ever
yet presented himself. For this
reason the article had been on
hand for three or four years and
become shel f -worn. It was there
fore offered cheap, considering
the fineness of its quality. But
on trying the headgear on it was
found to be a trifle too small and '
upon attempting to pull it down
in front the material, being some
what old and weakened, the rim
was torn off from ear to ear, leav
ing only the back part of the rim
attached, whilst the fore part
hung dangling under his chin. It
made him look like the pictures
of the Cannibal Islands.
- Mr. Chase's memory was sim
ply piodieious. He was an om
niverous reader and seemed to
remember all that he had ever
read. He could repeat the entire
contents of a newspaper or book
verbatim after several cartful
readings. I remember that at
one time there were several of us
in - his advanced reading class
that took two lessons in Pope's
translation of Virgil. There were
five or six of us in the class, each
in turn reading a paragraph of
twenty or thirty lines at a time,
Mr. Chase with the rest. He
had no book in his hand himself,
but constantly walked the floor
before us, correcting all the mis
takes made by those reading in
the books and then reciting his
ov. n paragraph in" regular order
from memory whenever it came
his turn to read. This he could
do throughout the entire length
of that masterly composition of
thirteen thousand, four hundred
and seventy lines.
Mr. Chase was ar. extraordin;
arily effective reader, owing to
his splendid voice, rhetorical
force and the hearty manner of
entering into the views and spirit
of ati author. He could recitt
the Aeneid of Virgil with such a
zesc and dramatic power that an
attentive and sympathizing list
ener could well nigh imagine that
he saw the rude warriors of that
early day excitedly rushing up
and down the banks of the mud'
dy Tiber; and then hear the loud
clangor of their arms as in com
pact ranks they marched and
fought over the Seven Hills cf
ancient Latinum, long before the
full establishment of Old Rome.
At least it would so appear to us
unsophisticated boys as we list
ened to him recite.
Mr. Chase's favorite authors,
tor nis own private reading, as
stated were mostly in the line of
poetry and fiction. ' Ht wa3 very
decided in his liking for Homer,
Virgil,. Shakespeare, Pope, Kirk
White, Byron, Sir Walter Scott,
Cervantes, Swift, Fielding and
Dickens. He had a keen appre
ciation of comedy, and always
had a readiness of repartee and
wit in conversation, such as night
have been expected from such an
apt student as he was of Dean
Swift and Sydney Smith. He
' was fall of humorous anecdotes,
puzzle and games calculated to
try the ingenuity of the recipient,
His ability for analytic reason-
iim- und apposite quotation-, fr jui
numerous authors made him a
formidable opponent in a public
discussion. Nearly the only man
in that part of the country who
could cope with him in an argu
ment was Dr. Robert L. Vanllar
lingen, a talented physician, born
and educated in Lebanon. Ohio,
but who long since died whilst on
a visit t6 Kansr.3, at a good old
age.
Another worthy co-temporary
of Mr. Chase at Ithaca was young
Daniel Francis, a sort of mathe
matical geniusthpsedays, who
had given successful attention to
the higher branches of that noble
science. He had mastered nearly
all of Dr. Charles Hutton's exten
sive university works on algebra,
trigonometry, conic sections and
surveying, under the instructions
of the Rev. Mr. Ogden of Ithaca,
an aged and scholarly Presbyter
ian clergyman, living a retired
life in that village.
Mr. Francis afterward removed
west and became a prominent
member of the Iowa state legis
lature.
Mr. Chase was naturally of an
amiable and peaceable disposi
tion and would not, intentionally.
have given pain 'to any living
creature. I never heard of his
having a quarrel with any one.
He was a great walker; going
from village to village' and from
one schqpl district to another.
He had neer been knew; to ride
either on horseback or in i wheel
ed vehicle. He seemed to think,
with David the Psalmist, that a
horse was a vain thing for safety ;
and, moreover, he loved walking
more than any other bodily exer
cise, i
. : Mr.. Chase. ha,d aboriginal, . in
genious and effective way ol
keeping his shoes clean in the
summer time. He accomplished
this feat by going barefooted;
and at such times he would re
peat a beatitude of his own get
ting up: "Blessed are tne bare-
ooted, for they shall not get their
boots muddy."
Mr. Chase had many serious
faults, but he never used tobacco
in any of its forms nor was he
given to profane swearing.
I can see, even yet, in my im
agination, the score of bright
eyed, tow-headed little boys and
girls (who, if yet living, must
now be seventy or more years of
age) , arranged in rows upon their
humble, backless benches; and I
can seem to hear their child-like
voices repeating the refrain of
"Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Leo, Vir
go, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,
Capricornus, Aquarius and Pis
ces,'' which were the names of
those prominent way-stations up
on the aun's stupendous pathway
through the skies, names so sug
gestive of the swiftly revolving
years that have already separated
us so far from those early days
that ar even now hurrying us so
rapidly on.
"From fancy's roll I call them,
And a far off echo 118
My soul with eager longing
As the old-time answer thrills;
To the same old rythmic flow
That bound in love the friends
Of seventy years ago.
"But many ne'er will answer
To an earthly call again;
The foil above is growing
While the few wlio here remain
Are waiting, glad to answer
'Present' on that, other shore,
- Glad to be again enrolled
Among the friends of yore."
At the close of the beautiful
summer of 1845, the orioles, the
blue birds, the robins and the
swallows all left the Upper Twin
Valley, Darke county, for anoth
et clime. So did Paul Chase.
Like our little friends, he left
many well, wishes but no unset
tied bills, behind. He had given
a full equivalent -for all that he
woie and ate, and more than an
equivalent in value, at least, for
much that he drank. But he left
us, with the same ultimate inten
tion as did the birds, for these
came back to u3 in the spring.
whilst the mysterious, eccentric
and wandering old school master
came not back with them. Nor
did he return the next year, nur
the next, nor the next; NO, nor
EVEN YET.

Myron T. Herrick Declares
Tariff to Be the Issue
of Campaign.
Salaries Under Herrick and
Cox; Discoverer of President
, Wilson Forsakes Him
Replying to the question of what
eemed to be most engrossing the at
tention of the voters of Ohio this cam
paign. Myron T. Herrick, the Repub
lican nominee for United States saoa
tor, recently said:
"It seems to me that the tariff la
the overwhelming issue this campaign.
It Is certainly to the forefront in
Ohio. Right here in Ohio we
had our own experience with the dis
asters of the Underwood tariff. My
own city of Cleveland was constrained
to raise the sum of $160,000 to provide
work for the unemployed and thus
prevent 'soup kitchens'' aad other, re
lief for the thousands of industrious,
thrifty working men who were walk
ing the streets thrown out of em
ployment throflgh no fault of theirs,
by the Democratic tariff.
"In February, 1914, in Cincinnati
there were 22,851 experienced machin
ists out of employment; there were
11,200 mechanics and helpers out of
employment. Soup kitchens were es
tablished. "Of the 86 manufacturing industries,
30 were entirely closed down, 10 were
working only 25 per cent of full time,
88 were working only 64 per cent of
full time, 8 were working 80 per cent
of full time and not a single one of the
entire i6 was working full time.
"And the experience of Cincinnati
and Cleveland was the experience of
Pittsburgh, of Philadelphia, New
'York, Chicago and of every other
large manufacturing center in the
country.
"The ending of the, tsar will turn out
thousands and thousands of men now
engaged in the making or handling of
ammunition and war supplies of spe
cial kinds that we are sending to Eu
rope in great quantities.
"We shall then have on our hands a
labor readjustment problem only less
in magnitude than that which will con
front Europe when its millions of sol
diers lay down their weapons and
turn to the avocations of peace."
SALARIES UNDER HERRICK AND
COX.
When Mr. Herrick went out of office
as governor of Ohio only one man ap
pointed by him received as high a
salary as $4,900 a year. That was the
commissioner of insurance. The first
Democratic governor after Herrick
raised that salary to $(,901. Gov. Cox
appointed twenty-three men to office,
each with, a salary of either 96,000 or
(6,000, and there wore a number of
others with salaries of 14,000. Many
of these had their salaries raised
from what they originally received. It
will be remembered that in nearly
every instance of laws creating the
many new offices there was a pro
vision that the governor was either to
fix the salary directly or that It waa to
be by his "consent and approval."
WILSON'S DISCOVERER FOR
HUGHES.
It la universally admitted that the
discoverer of Wilson as presidential
timber was Col. Harvey, editor of the
leading critical journal of the country,
the North American Review. Tne
reigning political sensation of the day
is a robust article by Col. Harvey In
the October number of the North
American Review, repudiating Wilson
and urging the election of Hughes.
CoL Harvey takes a strong stand for
protection. After pointing out that
there Is an unprecedented Industrial
war coming on among the nations
(after the present awful strife in Eu
rope), he says:
"The pressing question is, Which
of the two parties is the better
equipped to meet the aituatio&T And
we fear there can be but one answer.
Seven of the 14 Democratic members
of the present committee on ways and
means hall from North Carolina, Ten
nessee, Texas, Georgia, Missouri. Ar

man tTnderwood, a revenue tarUt man
of moderate views, has been succeed

even visited, disqualifies them tor In

demonstrates that President Wilson

WILLIS A8 A PUBLIC MAN.
Originating with a couple of Cox's
organs in Columbus (the Dispatch and
the Ohio State Journal both owned
by the Wolfe brothers, one a create of
Cox and the other drawing $12,000 a
year salary from the United States
government by the grace of President
Wilson) there is an effort being mad
by the Democrats to make it appear
that Gov. Willis is a man of small
caliber.
Men of affairs, both in Ohio and out
side, know this to be a jaundiced, ma
licious piece of spitework. But tew
public men have so impressed them
selves upon the country in such a
short time as has Gov. WlUls. The
universal testimony of observer in
cluding neutral and Democratic news
paper correspondents at the national
convention at Chicago, was that he, by
pure force of character, ability and en
ergy was one of the great leaders of
his party.
Two or three of Cox's lieutenants at
Columbus went to Chicago on purpose
to belittle Willis, but they themselves
were made to look the Insignificant
creatures.
At the recent state Republican con
vention of Michigan, Gov. Willis spoka
and the Associated Press (an Impar
tial authority) recorded that he de
livered "what was declared by many
to be one of the greatest speeches
made to a Michigan Republican con
vent, u a in years."
GOMPERS A DEMOCRAT.
Of course Samuel Gompers, presi
dent of the American Federation of
Labor, has every right te be a Demo
crat If he wants to be, but the Marion
(O.) Star asks by what right he 1 al
ways trying to dragoon the A. f. L.
into the Democratic camp. H is re
puted to be drawing a salary ef fT.BOe
a year (and expenses), and to this all
members of the federation contribute,
whether they be Republicans, Demo
crats, Socialists or what-not. Tet
Gompers claims the right te mount
the Democratic stump, te assail Re
publican candidates for office and te
demand that members of the federa
tion vote en masse for Democratic
candidates.
It will be remembered that Gompers
tried to swing the A. F. L. to Bryan,
but the members of that organisation
chose to do their own political thinn
ing and voting.
SOME HOT SHOTS.
. Senator Pomerer.e and Xbairman .
Fin ley would probably feel crowded
if their headquarters were in the same
block.
Nothing has bumped into Gov. Wil
lis' boom.
Our own self-respect demands that
we support Jhe man of deeds done in
the open against the man of furtive
and shifting political maneuvers.
From Theodora Roosevelt's Battle
Creek speech. Hew cold the Colonel
Is! What?
President Wilson prophesies war if
the Republican party win in Novem
ber. And he has about as much faith
in his own prediction aa he would put
in a report that the sky Is going te
fall next week.
Where Cox and his gang need to
place a rubber stamp, Ohio voters are
going to put their feet
In his desperation. President Wilson
is appealing to the yeung voters for
help. Probably he figures that it is
easy to fool them.
One objection to President Wilson
is that he thrills the people one day
and chills them the next with a change
of attitude.
If Cox is going to campaign en h
record those who place Gov. Willis"
plurality at only 100.NS run the risk
of being classed among pessimists.
Ohio Democrats may be interested
to know that the squirrel are laying
up large stores. According te tradi
tion, this means a long, hard winter.
It is a difficult matter to strike at
Gov. Cox's record without hitting a
vulnerable spot.
In what he called his "fighting
speech," delivered at Battle Creek,
Col. Roosevelt put this ringing appeal
before the people: "Repudiate Mr.
Wilson because only by so doing can
we save America from that taint of
gross selfishness and cowardice which
we owe to Mr. Wilson's substitution of
adroit elocution for straightforward
action."
Mr. Hughes doesnt seem te he run
ning out of issues. And as for Gov.
Willis, the Cox regime provided him
with enough to last through half a
dozen campaigns.
"FACTS NOT WORTH KNOWING"
