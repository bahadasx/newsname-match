ENTENTE FEARED FOR OWN SHIPS
Greece Also Ordered to Dismantle
Forts on Coast and Disarm
Naval Vessels.
London. Oct. 12. Vice-Admiral
Dartige du Kournet. commander of the
Anglo-French fleet in the Mediter
ranean, has presented an ultimatum
to Greece, demanding that Greece
hand over the entire Greek fleet, ex
cept the armored cruiser Averoff and
the buttelships Lemnos and Kilkis,
to the entente allies by 1 o'clock
Wednesday altarnoou, accordi.V-? to
Keuter's Athens correspondent. De
mand is also made for the control of
the Piraeus Larissa railway.
"The minister of marine," the
correspondent continues, "says
Vice-Admiral Fournct's demands will
be complied with and that the fleet
will be handed over before the pre
scribed time. The demands were made
as a pi ecautionary measure to insure
the safety of the allies' fleet."
It is explained that the dispatch of
artillery and ammunition to the in
terior, the movements of Greek ships
and the continued activity of the re
seivist leagues have aroused fears of
a disturbance of order at points where
the allies' war vessels are aifchored
and also endanger .the security of the
allied troops on the Balkan front.
Vice-Admiral du Fournet demands
the disarming of the Kilkis, demurs
and Averoff and the dismantling of
the forts on the sea coast, while the
two forts commanding the fleet's
moorings are to be made over to the
admiial. Control ot certain points
must also be placed in the hands of
the Anglo-French authorities, in ad
dition to the disarming of the war
ships named, their crews are to bo
reduced to one third of the regular
complement.

BULGARIANS LOSE
RAILROAD 01
LEFT WING
Line Supplying Forces in Macedon
ia Cut By British
ALLIED CMLRY NEAR SERES
French Break Through 150 Mile Bat
tie Line and Capture Trenches
By Storm. (
Paris, Oct. 11. A hea'-'-- blow was
dealt to the llulgarian left wlug in
eastern Macedonia today when British
troops cut the railroad between Demir
Hissar and Seres, the main artery of
this part of the Bulgar line. British
cavalry forces are only two miles from
Seres.
In the center of the 150 mile battle
line trench infantry cut through tue
Hulgar first line, taking by olorrn the
trenches on the heights west of Deved
jili. The French here are on the Ser
bian border.
The Serbian army is meeting des
perate resistance from the Hulgars.
Reenforcements have been sejit to the
Itulgar right wing.
The British are firmly "established
on both sides of the Demir Hissar
railroad. They have occupied Toplao
va, between the railroad. They have
occupied Topalovt, between the rail
road and the Struma, and Proscnik,
east of the railroad.
At the northern end of their new
front on the east bank of the Struma
the British are able to observe the
Bulgar troops six miles from Demir
Hissar. Today's British statement
announces that Bulgar working par
ties are busy there, evidently digging
new trenches in an attempt to sie.'i
the British advance. The new IWur
line is being dug between Barak' and
Barakll Jumu, east and west, re
specively of the railroad.
Having cut the railroad thus menac
ing the communications of the whole
Bulgar left wing, which is composed of
the seventh, ninth and tenth divisions,
the British are pushing out north am!
south toward Demir Hissar and
Seres.
The Bulgar positions in eastern
Macedonia depend mainly upon the
railroad from Demir Hissar, whicn
curves down through Seres to Drama,
and finally east to Adrlanople. It is
tthe only railroad in the occupied ter
ritory, which is mountainous and has
poor roads.
London, Oct. 11. Finding them
selves unable by two violent counter
attacks to recapture from the French
a single yard of the ground lest yes
terday south of the Somme. the Ger
mans today admit their defeat. The
Germans also tell of the loss of the
hamlet of Genermont in yerterday's
attack, the capture of which the
French had not reported.
Paris announces more of the exten
sive air raiding of German communi
cations that usually precedes attacks
on a vast scale, and all the olllcial
statements mention very heavy bom
bardments. Particularly about Ver
dun the artillery was busy, indicating
that the Crown Prince may again in
tend to take the offensive.
Louden, Oct. ll.-tierman troops
fighting beside the Austrians in Ga
licia stormed the village of Ilebutov
on the Narayuvka Kiver, southeast of
Lemberg, today, according to an Aus
trian statement. The statement also
sa.Vs that Russian attacks in the Lu
dova sector were repulsed.
Regarding the battle for Kovel and
Lemberg that has raged fiercely for
weeks the Russian and German state
ments today say there were no events
of importance.

ABANDONED BOATS FOUND
May Indicate Kingstonian's Crew Has
Been Picked Up.
Newport. ; It. I., Oct. 12 The find
ing of five abandoned ship's boats by
the Spanish Fteamer Antonio Lopez,
reported in a radio message relayed
to the naval statiou yesterday by the
Nantucket shoals lightship, was con
sidered in nava! circle's as suggesting
a possible trace of the crew of the
steamship Klngstonian, reported tor
pedoed by a German submarine on
Sunday. Search tor the crew had
been suspended by the naval authori
ties, who doubted whether the subma
rine's victims included any vessel oth
er than those whose crews had been
brought to port. By some tlte mes
sage was held to be far from condu
cive evidence that a sixth veseel was
sunk, the suggestion being made that
the boats may have been those from
which a crew, now ashore, was taken.
"We have found five abandoned
boats along a radius of three miles,"
the message said. The rest of the ra
diogram was somewhat unintelligible
because cf evident errors in transmis
sion. As received it read: "They had
on board his apparel only. It is
impossible to read his names. One of
them had painted word 'Liverpool.'
All in good condition." Radio oper
ators could not suggest a word which
might sound like "his" in wireless
waves.
Liverpool in the hailing port of the
steamship Klngstonian, and from
that fact naval officers developed the
possibility that the boats were from
that vessel. Liverpool also is the hail
ing port of the steamer West Point,
whose crew was rescued by a torpedo
boat destroyer. Whether all the V." tt
Point's boats are accounted for had
not been determined yesterday. The
statement that the missing boats were
in good shape was accepted as an In
dication that no harm hail befallen
tlmse who were in them. If the boats
were those of the Klngstonian it was
thought her crew probably was picked
up by an east-bcund vessel which will
land them on the other side.

WAR TO GO ON TILL
FUTURE JS SAFE
SAYS J8QUITH
Sacrifices of Allies Must Not Have
Been Made irrVain
PREMIE ASKS FOR MORE MONEY
Struggle Has Cost More Than Entire
Expenses of Government for
20 Years.
London. Oct. 12. "This is no time
for faltering counsel or wavering pur
pose," said Premier Asquith in ad
dressing the House of Commons at
London yesterday. "This war cannot
be allowed to end in some patched up.
precarious and dishonoring com
promise masquerading untler the nam.'
of peace.
.' No one desire to prolong for 3
(.ingle moment lent-er than is nece
sary the tragic spectacle of b!'wdsind
and destruction but we owe it to
those who have given their lives that
their supreme sacrifice thall not have
been unavailing.
"The ends of the allies are well
known. They have been frei'itn:.ly
stated. They are not selfisii; they
are not vindictive; but they require
adequate reparation for tlio past and
adequate sectinty for the fuljrj."
The House cheered the p.cnr.er
loudly as lie mv.ic these remarks in
concluding ins address after moving
a vote of credit for 3n0,0u0.i'"0.
bringing up the total for the current
financial year to 1,350,000.000. Par
liament, said the premier, had been
asked to vote for war purposes
what was equivalent to the abro
gate expenditure for 20 years bef.ire
the war. although that period in
cluded the South African war. When
he moved the last v-.it; of cmdit in
.hiy be eotimated the average ralo
of expenditure at approximately L'5.
ooO.ooo daily. That forecast had
proved to be almost exactly correct.
Surveying the progress of the war
since the last vote of credit, the pre
mier said hot weather had hampep.-d
operations in the secondary tlH.aters
but that in Mesopotamia auostrtiit .il
j. regress had been made at rrti' and
river communications and the htalih
of the troops had improved substan
tially. The defeat of the Tu.'ks at Ue
Katia oasis east ot tlio Sue canal
had gone far to remove the da ii.-;r
of attack on ttn canal ami nad Im
paired Turkish prestige in Arabia and
Syria. In western Kgyp Uie Se.nis
si tribennen had been reduced to Un
potence. The allied armies on the
Saloniea front had inflicted h.ny
losses on their opponents and pre
vented them from transferring troops
to Uobrudja, thus rendering valuable
assistance to Russia and Rumania.
The whole of the German Eas
African coats had p"n oecuxd. the
premier continued and the complete
conquest of the c.ii my was only a
matter of time. The premier gnv
high praise to Gen. Si.'tits and the
Belgian troops which are co-operating
with him.
In the west Mr. Asquith said Die
French and British had advanced a
distance of seven miles on a front
of nine miles! but the most Important
feature of the advance was that in no
case had a counter-attack succeeded
in dtiving them back. The Germans
had virtually abandoned the attack
on Verdun and their losses had been
very heavy. He gave the total num
ber of prisoners taken by the allies on
the Somme front as (10,471 in addition
to which there had been captured :h4
guns and lOIiO machine guns.

Patrolmen.
Bayonne, N. J., Oct. 12 The strik
ing employes of the Standard Oil
company are in complete possession
of Bayonne today. It is now known
that four strikers were mortally hurt
when the police fired a volley into a
mob yesterday and at least o0 more
have bullet wounds. Pour policemen
were wounded by shots of the strik
ers. The strikers today made an attempt
to burn Samuel Greenberg, a saloon
keeper who was suspected of talking
to strikebreakers. His building was
set on fire and he and his family w ere
driven to the roof. Later they were
rescued by firemen. Greenberg's
house was burned to the ground.
An attempt was made today to burn
the plant of the Tidewater Oil com
pany. When an alarm was sent in the
strikers intercepted the firemen.
New York, Oct. 12. A woman was
killed, two men probably mortally
wounded and a half-dozen other per
sons less seriously hurt when the po
lice fired a volley at Bayonne, N. J.,
last night into a crowd of Standard
oil strikers and their sympathizers,
which was demolishing a tire engine.
The engine had responded to an alarm
and had been held up by a carrlcade
thrown across tho street by the strik
er. Miss Tcrack was not a participant
in the battle. She was watching, the
tight fiom a window of her home a
lew yards away when a shot struck
her in the head.
The firemen, responding to an
alarm were compelled to thread their
way through streets which had been
barricaded by the strikers and their
friends. They were jeered and mis
siles were hurled at them as they ad
vanced. The crowd -which followed
them soon became menacing and sur
rounded the- apparatus. Then a con
certed attack was made on the engine,
which was quickly wrecked. The fire
men were overpowered, but not until
they had sent, a call for police as
sistance. The battle which followed
the arrival of the patrolmen. who
opened lire as they approached, was
sharply contested. The concerted at
tack finally won. however, and the
mob was dispersed.
