To Ernie Shore, elongated
righthander of the Sox, went the
honor of stowing away the cham

In the series.
Hrooklyn started the scoring in
the second inning, but Boston tied
up Ihe score in her half of the

Cutshaw walked, was sacrificed

on a passed ball that rolled to the
grandstand.
For Boston, Lewis got a lucky
triple that would have been a sin
gle had It not bounded over
Wheat's head. He scored on Gard
ner's nicely placed sacrifice fly.
Oarrignn's men jumped into the
lead with two runs tn the third,
through heavy hitting and Short-
Btop Olson's bad playing. After
Cadj hud singled and Hooper
walked, Janvrin hit to Olson, who
Juggled the grounder and then
threw wild to head off Hooper at

In tTto first four innings, al
though they had scored one run,
the Brooklyn players had been un

The crowd was immense, pack

It displayed comparatively little
enthusiasm.
Boston had a chance to become
dangerous in the fourth, when
Hoblitzell walked, was sacrificed
to second, and took third on

But Pfeffer held Scott to an in

'MAD KING'
OTTO DEAD
(tnilrd I'rriiK I rnanl Wlrr.)
rOPKXHAGKX, Oct. 12.—
King Otto of \ avni in. I'.u
ro|ie'H "Mad King," tiled sud
denly at the castle of Fuer
stenried, where he has been
confined, insane, for several
years.
The "mad king" of Bavaria,
about 70 years of age at the tlnio
of his death,, startled Europe by
his ecentrlcitles before he waa de-'
clared incapable of ruling on No
vember 5, 1913, aud was succeed
ed by his cousin, King Ludwig
111.
He had nominally succeeded ititi
brother, King l.udwig 11, in 1888,
when l.udwig committed suicide
by throwing himself into a laKe
during a fit of Insanity. His
uncle, the Regent Lv lipoid, was,
however, the real ruler.
During the Franco-Prussian j
war Otto first showed symptoms
of insanity when he called out a
squad of cavalry to charge
straight at a stone wall.
The stone wall, he said, was a
body of French infantry.
Several years ago the "mad
king" was Imprisoned in the
Fuerstenrid castle. Though in
the midst of rich furnishings, he
is reported to have lived like a
savage, refusing to have his hair
or nails cut and avoiding water
and soap.
He was passionately fond of
grand opera, summoned well
known singers to his castle prison
and often spent days listening to
operas.
SMASH THE
WOULD-BE
BOOZE KING
Strike, Mr. Remann, at the Big Fig
ure in this booze business! Today his
identity is looming forth so plainly that
almost any Tacoman can distinguish his
familiar visage.
For many years he has been a feed
er off the profits of Tacoma vice, a law
breaker and the head of an organized
gang of law-breakers.
Strike him down. Do not let him
build up a flourishing illicit booze bus
iness, as in years past feeble prosecutors
and venal police chiefs permitted him
to establish a small monarchy of another
sort of vice.
SMASH HIM, MR. REMANNI
MAYOR WOULD
ABOLISH BOARD
Mayor Fawcett has always been
known as Tacoma s fighting may
or.
But he has been lonesome dur
ing the past year because he
didn't have any big fight to
handle. Municipal affairs sailed
along pretty smoothly.
In the public service commis
sion, however, Tacoma's mayor
hao suddenly found a fight. And
he is making it a big fight. It
will he one ot the greatest of his
career, he thinks.
T. It. .V P.'s Big Kcque*t.
Ever since the legislature creat
es' this commission, destined to
act as a Jury on all problems be
tween the public service corpora
tions and the people, Fawcett has
eyed the board askance. He
found that the commission had
an laiense power to regulate rates
and that the "regulation" often
meant increased prices for the
people.
And now the Tacoma Railway
ft Power Co. comes along with a
petition asking the public service
commission to relieve It of all of
the charges which It promised to
pay the city for use of Tacoma's
streets.
It's a big request, but the com
mission, sitting In Its offices in
the oapitol building at Olympia,
has tlie power to grant it.
Fears HM'cnt Fare.
Mayor Fawcett Isn't so afraid
that the commission will permit
the T. R. ft P. Co. to slice out of
its contracts, as he Is afraid that
It will let the street railway peo
ple Increase their fare to 10 cents
on such long routes as Fern Hill,
Larehmont. South Tacoma, Point
Defiance, Regents Park, Blsmark
and other outlying lines.
Fawcett proiroses to kill the
commission, so far as utilities
within cities are concerned any
how.
Today he issued a long state
ment to the public, asking the
people to get Into the fight with
him, if they expect to ever see
Tacoma advance.
He has already asked mayors
of other cities in the state to join
the fight, and they have gladly
united with him.
Up to < 'andldates.
He has sent out letters to every
candidate for legislature in Pierce
county aski*g them to state
whether they will help. And the
other mayors are doing likewise.
"The bill to release cities from
this commission can be passed if
the people will line up the legisla
tors," declared Fawcett Thursday.
"Let no man be elected from
Pierce county who will not pledge
himself to vote to repeal the law
giving the public service commis
sion authority over our cities.
"I have asked every candidate
for the legislature by letter to so
pledge himself. Thus far Elmer
E. Healey, Edward H. Benjamin
and Dr. W. P. Goff hae done so.
Torger Peterson has dodged. The
rest thus far are silent.
"It Is up to the people of Ta
coma."
