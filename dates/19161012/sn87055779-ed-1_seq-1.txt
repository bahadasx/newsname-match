WASHINGTON. Oct. 12. Accept
ing the belief of the naval experts
that the Herman submarines U-53
and C-Cl have clerarted for their
home base, See'y Lansing ncl his
advisers today hetran compiling all
possible data resanlin their opera
tions on this .ide of the Atlantic.
I'ntil this is done no further action
is to be taken.
The state department now is com
pletely convinced that Sunday's raid
off Nantucket was. intended for an
objevt lesson." It is agreed hy all
ollkials here that the German craft
rigidly observed all of the require
ments of international law. But
officials fear that the success of this
raid will lead to others on a much
larger seal v. ith possible complica
tions and this is what this provern
ment most desires to avoid.
HxiKM't No lonnal Note.
That a susestion is to be con
veyed to Germany that this govern
ment hopes that submarine opera
tions shall be limited to the other
side of the ocean is considered cer
tain. Hut it is unlikely that this
suffttestion will be made in the form
of a nior.il note at present.
Sec'y Iinsin and his advisers
withheld all information reardins
the- note to Great Uritain asking that
her crui-ers be withdrawn from
American ports for months and it id
entirely possible that similar action
will be taken in the German case.
Officials frankly are puzzled over
the silence of the British and French
embassies. There lias been no pro-
Itest tiled other than the "casual
J mention" of the presence of the
submarine made by Sir Cecil Sprins
Ilice, th1 F.rit'sh ambassador, lust
Saturday when he was at the state
department. Officials at the em
bassies refuse to discuss the situa
tion other than to say that they are
waiting in? ructions from their home
o ernmonts.
Fifty Miles Off Ooat.
State department othcials point
out that German submarine opera
tions ware at points more than 50
miles off the oast.
F.eciuso of this the Fnited State
will not concern itself with them.
The chief intercs-t now, tt is stated,
will be centered in what may hap
pen in the future. And it is to get
all of the facts possible properly
compiled that the state department
now must devot itself.
Th' neutrality board of which
James Frown Scott of the Carneirie

in ib terrrininir all of the facts.

BRAVES' FIELD, Oct 12,
Boston won the tifth tramc here
this afternoon and the world's
championship hy a count of four
panics to one. The Dodders
scored the first run in the second
inning hut the Sox overcame
the handicap and won out.
The score was 4 t t.

Pfeffer, who was cal.e.1 on a a
relief hurler in two .if tro- games,
was the pitching t-tle'tiou lor
Brooklyn. It was h's tir.-t change to
ro nine full innings. Shor-, who
worked in the iir.-t game, but w .is

The multitude lh.it s.it m this af

record smasher in si. . The im

were p.ickc.j to eapacity. And hun
dreds, stood in the center field "bull

It looked like 4 1.jG at least,
against the old record if 42. ::('.
The bleacher sc. its were packed at
roon. Ttiis was c'.. Iambus d.iy a
legal holiday in Bo-ton the.
natives had no business at Mictions to
ke..p them away. The reserved seat
holders were late in arriving.
A chilly wind swept across t h?
field and finally forc d the oovvd to
jump up and stamp its feet to as
sist circulation.
Realizing that victory this after
noon means another world's chain-
