CROWN PROSECUTOR
OUTLINES HIS CASE
Tells of Alleged Machina
tions of Casement in
1
Germany.
Xjondon, May 15.—Sir Roger Case
ment, suppose! head and prime In
stigator of the Sinn Fein -rebellion
In Ireland, was arraigned today,
charged with higb treason.
The few spectators who were per*
mitted to enter the famous old
Bow Street police court were con
siderably surprised when a second
prisoner was placed beside Case
ment In the dock. This man was
Daniel Jnllun Bailey, private sol
dier, whose home Is at Weutbly, a
village near Ixmdon. Bailey was
arrested yesterday. He was Joint
ly cbaiged with Casement with
high treason.
In opening the case for the
crown, the attorney general, Sir
Frederick Smith, charged that
Casement had been conducting a
systematic campaign among the
Irish prisoners in Germany with the
purpoee of seducing them from
from their allegiance.
Bailey, he said,'
In fh'r inditmiri -i

Bailey waa born in Dublin, and joined
the Irish Rifles In 1904.
Mrvaft wiftltfirfeglraent in- It
ktii discharged. On
th« batbreaklof the Uiiropean yrkr
Bailey was called out as a reservist,
and sailed with the original expedi
tionary fores to France. He w&a tak
en prisoner In September, 1914.
Casement Addressed Prisoners.
The attorney general said Bailey
had related hojr large a number of
Irish prisoners have been collected
from various .prisons in Germany ahd
placed in a large oamp at Limburg.
There they heard addresses by Case
ment, who tried to inflame their
minds against the British government,
and persuaded them to break their
oaths of allegiance, and support him
in his projected expedition to Ireland.
The attorney general said Casement
described himself as an organiser of
Irish volunteers, and Impressed upon
the Irish prisoners in Germany that
everything was to be gained for Ire
land by Germany's winning the war.
Those prisoners who Joined the bri
gade he was attempting .to form were
promised by Casement that they
would be sent to' Berlin as guests of
the German government. In the event
that Germany won a sea battle, he
would land a brigade In Ireland to de
fend that country against England,
and if Germany lost the war, the Ger
man government would give each man
$50 to $100 and free passage to
America.
"This is the plan eonoelved in 1915,"
said the attorney general, "by the
man who in 1911, was begging Sir
Edward Grey to convey his deep ap
preciation to the king for thehonor
of knighthood which bad' JUst been
conferred on him."
Treated With Contempt.
When the speaker added that Cass
ment's otter was treated with eon
tempt by the vast majority of Irish
prisoners, Casement smiled and
glanced toward Bailey.
Sir Frederick Smith forwarded the
story of Casement's alleged machina
tions in Berlin with details of Case
ment's trip by German submarine to
Tralee, where he landed on Good Fri
day with Bailey and a third man
named Monteith, who still is at large.
He also told of the lending of a ship
with 20,000 rifles from Germany to
Tralee and of how the ship was' sunk
at Tralee and the crew captured.

1,600 applications have been received.
The committee on arrangements

begins bis article by quoting from a

Continuing, he says:
"To the normal republican advan

Without attempting to decide whether
the president was wise or unwise In
taking the course that'alienated them,
the party is confronted with the fact
that this alienation will cost it a large
