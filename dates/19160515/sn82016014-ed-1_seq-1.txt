15,000 Witness Kerenge in
Weeo, Tex., Public Square.
Waco, Texas, May 15. With
15,000 persons at witnesses, in
cluding . women and children,
Jesse Washington, negro youth,
who confessed to the criminal
attacking and murder of Mrs.
Lucy Fryar, seven miles south
of here, last Monday, was taken
from the fifth district court
room today and burned on the
public square.
The burning came immediately aft
er the negro's trial had ended ant? aft
er the jury had returned a verdict of
jruilty, fcivins him the death penalty.
Some one nut far from the negro
started the cry of "Get the negro." It
was taken up by all of those from that
part of the country where Mrs. Fryar
was killed, and Washington was then
seized and removed from the court
room. H'Uiin Too Good.
The crowd at first seemed willing
to hanpr the nrgry from the suspen
sion britipe, but a suggestion that he
be burned on the plaza met with in
stant response, and he was dragged to
the city hall yard, where the chain
already around his neck was thrown
over the limb of a tree, wood hastily
secured and the fire started. When
the flames had suosided somewhat,
uuite a number in tie crowd cut off
the negro's fire blistered fingers and
other parts of his body.
Couldn't Stop Rush.
After the verdict had been re
turned, the negro said in a half audible
whimper. "I'm sorry I done it."
No demonstration was made, until
oft1!- the jury's verdict had been re
ccivt?d and preparations were being
made to remove the prisoner to the
jail. The rush came with such sud
denness that officers, lawyers and
newspaper men were swept off their
feet, and the negro secured before any
could stop the proceedings.
While the crowd that took Wash
ington from the courtroom is said to
have been composed of people from
the country, they were joined by many
citizens of Waco, and in some in
stiipcs, it is said, people left their
places of business to view the burning
of the ppgro, whose body was burned
to a criso.
lrr$rrcd Body ni Street.
Aft?r the fire had burned itself out,
the remains were viewed by the coro
ner whose verdict has not yet been
announced.
About 1 o'clock some members of
the mob returned to the scene of the
burning, put the charred body in a
sack, and with a man on horseback,
dryged the body through the prin
cipal streets. The horseman headed
i nthe direction of Robinson, where
Mrs. Fryar was murdered, and it is
thought to be the intention to carry
the body back to the scene of the
crime.

Germany Incensed Over His
Fictitious Report.
The TTrr-rnc. May 15.- Severe pun

mander of the 'Jerman submarine
which attacked the Sussex, it is gen
erally believed in well informed cir
cles in Terlin, though no official re
port of the" nature of the punishment
has been made public.
This belief is based largely on the
Indignation lelt in Berlin and through
out Ciermany over the U-boat com
ma nrter's act. His report was im
plicity believed until the American
government presented conclusive evi
dence showing that the channel pac
ket was torpedoed. In view of the
evidence, Germans feel that they were
put in a rather humiliating position.
It is not misstating- the case to say
that the submarine commander's de
ception caused as much indignation in
Berlin a3 it did in "Washington.

Pay Half Per Cent More Than
Offered in Topeka.
Although Topeka banks admit they
are unable to pay more than two per
cent on the county's daily b .lances,
the little bank at Willard has offered
to pay the county two and one-half
per cent on an " open checking ac
count. The county commissioners to
day authorized the county treasurer
to deposit $5,000 .with the Willard
bank. The money will be subject to
the same fluctuation it would be in
the Vis Topeka banks but the Willard
bank can afford to pay one-:ialf of
one per cent more than the Topeka
banks.
t The county now has $20,000 in each
of the two banks at Rossville, $10,000
in the Silver Lake bank and has au
thorized the placing of $5,000 in the
Willard bank. There are still several
banks in the county outside of Topeka.
There is one at Richland, one at Do

Ryan happened into Lemont in an
automobile and lost no time in im
pressing the people of that town with
his supposed wealth. As he stepped
from his car. he lit a cigar with a
paper bill and then started to give the
people around town a good time. Most
of this was done with money obtained
on cheeks which he cashed, it is
charged. .
- Saturday the checks began coming
back marked "No funds," and Ry.in
was arrested. On the way to the jail

THE BANKERS'
"COMBINE"
County Should Receive 50
More on Daily Balances -
Than the Uniform Bid of All
the Topeka Banks.
Action Loses Much Money to
County. State Journal To
Be Humiliated.
About the mirirt to rtt A nr-il tilnP
banks and two trust companies of the
city of Topeka, each and all in one
as to rate uniformity .and date of ef
fect and alleged reason for their- ac
tion, served notice on the board of
county commissioners of Shawnee
county that on and after May 1st they,
each and severally and any and all of
them, would pay only, two per cent
on daily balances.
Several of these banks had already
established the rate by bidding for
and securing city school board money
or money from the state of Kansas
at the rate of three per cent or UP-
wards on rillv bnlnce.
inis uniiorm action on me part or
each and all the banks herewith nam-
ed was for the purpose of depriving
the county of its just rate of interest
on daily balances and for the other
further purpose of humiliating the To
peka State Journal before this com
munity and warning the paper that
hereafter it should not undertake to
meddle in financial affairs. .
By reason of the uniform action on
the part of each and every bank in the
city of Topkea, the county was appar
ently at the mercy of these banks and
would hereafter be obliged to fail to I served in Detroit, fhe business corn
receive fifty per cent more in interest I munity, and particularly that part of
vu uaiiy- uaiunces, uecause me proper
rale as fixed by the banks themselves
was three per cent. The rate named
in the letters herewith was fixed by
the banks at 2 per cent. In other
words, if the county got its just dues
from the banks for interest on daily
deposits running through the year, the
county-would receive three per cent
or fifty per cent more than the two
per cent offered.
The State Journal had undertaken
in good, faith to defend the interests
of the city of Topeka and the county
of Shawnee, and it still means to de
fend those interests. It means to keep
up this agitation until the county se
cures three per cent on its daily bal
ances and until the city secures the
same. '
The order went forth to all the
bankers to write the uniform letter,
and thereby the county would fail to
receive fifty per cent more than the
new and uniform offer recently made
by each and all of the banks; that is
to say, instead of the three per cent
which the bankers had themselves
fixed as a fair rate, as above noted,
the county would have to take the two
per cent they offered, three per cent
being fifty per cent more than the two
per cent. At the same time the State
Journal would be taught a lesson once
and for all not to interfere in financial
affairs affecting the city and county's
welfare.
The idea being to humiliate the
State Journal before this community
wnere tne paper has been published
under the same management for over
thirty years; to let this paper know
that if in laboring for the welfare of
Topeka and Shawnee county any pre

that this situation is one of recent

little Roosevelt sentiment. Among the

took no part, though as individuals
they succeeded in putting many

whether he should be held for trial
on the charge of high treason against
the same government in connection
with the rebellion. in Ireland. Beside
Casement stood Daniel Julian Bailey,
who faced a similar charge.
Not in many years has so much
popular interest been manifested in a
case before the courts. This is duo
not only to the prominence of Case
ment and to speculation as to his ulti
mate fate but also becaur.e it has been

which would lay bare a widespread
plot resulting in the revolt. Jjong be

Bow street court.

resentatives of the press. Among th
earliest arrivals in the couit was Sir

were provided with seats well to the
front. -
The stage was all set when the prin
cipal was led into the court. Sir John
Dickinson, who pretided, the lawyers
and the witnesses all having taken
neir places hefoie Casement arrived
and entered the dock. There was a
hush of expectancy as he entered the
room and every face was turned in his

maintained much of his characteristic
complaiance. He smiled and nodded
as he saw friends in the courtroom.

Germany to Ireland in the submarine
with Sir Roger and was taken pris

notes which he handed to his counsel
