London, May 15. The British lines
about the Ploegstecrt "Wood in Fland
ers were attacked by the Germans on
Saturday night in three parties, accord
ing to an official bulletin issued here
tonight. The attack took place "after
a heavy bombardment by' guns of all
natures," and one of the three parties
succeeded in entering the : British
trenches, "but was immediately eject
ed, leaving ten dead. The other part
ies were met on the parapet by Scot
tish troops and dispersed."
"Early this morning," the statement
continues, "one of our patrols entered
the enemy trenches south of La Bassee
Canal. Our artillery bombarded ene
my positions north of Monchy-au-Bois
and east of Vermelles.
"Hostile artillery and trench mor
tars were active about Maricourt, Loos,
Souchez, Cambrin and St. Eloi. There
was some activity about Souchez, the
Hohenzollern redoubt, Givenchy and
St. Eloi."
The German official account of these
activities Is as follows:
"A reconnoitring detachment pene
trated the enemy's line near Ploeg
steert Wood, north of Armentieres,
blew p a sap and returned with ten
captured British soldiers. In the dis
trict of Givenchy-en-Gohelle mines
were exploded in positions of the Brit
ish. Fighting about the crater? and
in trenches-was uccesshil for ub."
London, May 14. The Russians and
the Turks are keeping up their attacks
and counter attacks in the region south
of Treblzond and also west of the Per
Blan border, where the Russian? are
endeavoring to force their way tiuough
Mesopotamia, with Bagdad and a junc
tion with the British forces further
south their evident objectives.
In the Kope mountain region, north
west of Erzerum, the repulse of itus
slan attacks to regain lost positions is
reported by Constantinople. Petrorad

gan and Aschkala the Turks forced
their advance guards to retire at some
points, but says the Ottoman forces
desisted in their attacks after having
suffered extremely heavy casualties.

Chihuahua, on their way to Mexico
City, expressed themselves today as
pleased with the results of the border
conference and said that they thought
the authorities In Washington and

agreement satisfactory to both. Presi
dent Wilson's policy of giving the Con
stitutlonal forces a chance to show
their ability to clean out the Villistas
had been well received by the govern
ment, they Bald.
If any trouble were precipitated,
they asserted, it would bo due to the
machinations of political enemies

Preliminary Hearing Being Held in
Bow Street Police Court
LESS TENSION IN DUBLIN
Modification of Martial Law Follows
Arrival of Premier Asquith In the
City.
London. May 15. The preliminary
trial of Sir Roger Casement on the
charge of high treason was begun in
the Bow street police court today.
The prisoner entered the court room
smiling accompanied to the dock by
Daniel Bailey, an Irish soldier, also
charged with treason.
Attorney General Smith in opening
the case for the government stated
the charge against the prisoner and
briefly sketched his life. The attorney
general stated that the prisoner not
only conspired to start an insurrection
in Ireland but that he also plotted to
land expeditions at different points on
the British coast, in Germany, it is
charged Sir Roger attempted to win
ish prisoners from their allegiance to
Great Britain. Iiailcy is one of the
prisoners Involved in the latter charge.
Dublin, May 14. The great mollifi
cation in the regulations of matial law
gave the people of Dublin today a free
dom of movement strongly contrasting
with the restrictions imposed since the
rebellion. All may now come and go
as they wish between the hours of 4 in
the morning and midnight. During the
remaining four hours they must keep
within doors.
It is generally understood that Pre
mier Asquith is responsible for th.li
relaxation. The Premier's study of con
ditions and the sentiments of the peo
ple apparently convinced him that
there was no great element of rebel
lious spirit remaining.
Mr. Asquith's chief occupation since
his arrival in Dublin has consisted in
seeking a method for the adjustment
of the Irish crisis and in ascertaining
whether it would be advisable to re
turn to the former system of govern
ment or adopt a change of rule more
in accordance with the wishes of the
people. The Premier has also given
some attention to minor factors, these
having to do with the disposal of the
remaining rebel prisoners and compen
sation for the material damage done
in Dublin.
Netlher of these questions has yet
been solved, but Mr. Asquith had an
opportunity to see and question a num
ber of rebels in the detention barracks,
and today again visited the ruins of the
buildings destroyed in various sections
of the city. The information he thus
obtained may be of great service to him
when the subject Is brought before the
cabinet on his return to London, which
is expected at an early date.
TOO MUCH MOVING
Vermont Farms Suffer from Frequent
Change of Owners.
So much transferring of farms, ac
companied by so many movlngs about
of owners or tenants, hasn't been not
ed In Vermont for a long time as it
hns been noted during tho present
spring, says the Barrc Times.
The wonder is. that the participants
in the changes do not spend all their
surplus cash and thus set them back
for years to come. Moreover, con
stant flitting about must tend to break
the continuity of effort in such a man
ner as to handicap the earning capa
city of hundreds of men.
It is reasonable enough for men to
seek better conditions whether it be
in farm operations or otherwise; but
many of the men who are moving
from one farm to another every year
nr an would do far better to stick to
the farms where they are located and
to endeavor to bring those farms up

FU PEACE. SAYS
PUiF'C ARE
Declares Only One Settle
ment Will Be Acceptable
NO CONDITIONS TO BE ACCEPTED
Allies Will Agree to Those Terms
Which Will Eliminate the Possi
bility of Future Wars.
Taris, May 14. President Poincare,
in an address at Nancy yesterday, re
sponded to Germany's declaration re
garding peace contained in the Ger
man reply to the American note.
"France does not want Germany to
tender peace," said the president, "but
wants her adversary to ask for peace."
The president then made known
clearly the only kind of peace which
would be acceptable to France. The
address was delivered at the Moliter
garrison before large number of
Lorraine refugees, to whom the presi
dent, after expressing his sympathies
and renewing promises of solicitude
and protection, said:
"France will not expose her sons to
the danger of new aggressions. The
central empires, hauuted by remorse
with having brought on the war, and
terrified by the indignation and hatred
they have stirred up in mankind, are
trying today to make the world be
' lieve that the allies alone are responsl
j ble for the prolongation of hostilities
a dull irony which will deceive no
one.
"Neither'directly nor indirectly have
our enemies offered us peace. Hut we
do not want them to orfer it to us;
we want them to ask it of us. We do
not want to submit to their condi
tions; we want to tnvpose ours on
them. We do not want a peace which
would leave imperial Germany with
the power to recommence the war and j
t0 keep Elirol6 eternally menaced.
We want peace which receives from
restored rights serious guarantees of
equilibrium and stability. So long as
that peace is not assured to us; so
! long as our enemies will not recognize
, themselves as vanquished, we will not J
' cease to light." - . !
President Poincare told the refugees
that they were only a small number of
the victims of the invasion; these
were distributed in all parts of the
country and there was not a depart
ment that was' not sheltering thous
ands. Everywhere they were waiting
with calm confidence for the hour of
deliverance.

DEATH OF FRANCIS CONE
Bennington Farmer for Nearly 50
Years Passed Away Saturday Night
Francis Cone, aged 80 years, died
Saturday night at the home of his son-in-law,
John Ryan on Depot street, af
ter a short illness. His funeral is to
be held at 9 o'clock Tuesday morning
from St. Francis do Sales church.
Mr. Cone was probably one of the
oldest tanners in and around Ben
nington following the occupation al
most continuously for 00 years. He
was a native of county Galway, Ire
land, coining to this country alone
when about sixteen years old. He
came directly to Bennington and set
tled finally on a farm on Bennington
flats. Shortly after getting settled
here, he married Miss Catherine Crav
en, also of County Galway, and during
their married lle seven children were
born to them, of whom but three are
now living. Alter a married life reach
ing over half a century, Mrs. Cone
died about eight years ago, since
which time Mr. Cone has lived with
his children in the village.
Mr. Cone is survived by three daugh
ters, Mrs. W. T. Phelan of Cambridge,
Mass., Mrs. John Ryan and Miss Jen
nie Cone of Depot street; one brother,
James Cone of this town; and six
grandchildren.
He outlived another brother,
Thomas Cone, by exactly one week,
the funeral of the latter having been
held a week ago in Lincoln, Mass.
Aside from being a communicant of
St. Francis church, Mr. Cone had no
other affiliations. He was known dur
ing his life here as a respectable, pros
perous, hard-working man and his
death removes ono who was well
known and well-thought of, among the
elderly people of the village.
"AS YOU LIKE IT"
High School Students Breathlessly
Awaiting "Opening Night"
When you meet a high school stu
dent shambling aimlessly along Main
street this week talking to himself, lie
has not gone foolish with overstudy
he is merely rehearsing his part for
"As You Like It" which is to be put on
by the students In high school hall Fri
day evening.
Whether Shakespeare wrote this
famous play or whether it was from
tho gifted pen of Bacon is not worrying '
the local boys and girls; there being!
no court judge in Bennington w ho feels
equal to deciding the question. The j
hoys and girls already have enough :
worry remembering their cue words j
and as for the benefit of the doubt in i
view of this being the tercentenery of
the Avon bard's birth.
The sewing classes have worked
hard on the costumes and curtains and
the boys of the manual training classes
have prepared the stage and properties.
The play Is to be given with exactly
the same stage settings as it was put
on in Elizabethian times. Tickets
have already gone on sale at Evans
store, 25c each.
Mrs. Arthur Elliot has been coaching
the cast and has them whipped into
shape so that the boys do not step on
the trains of the girls nor speak their
parts to themselves.
The profit from tho performance, If
any results, will be utilizied to defray
the expenses of the basket ball team j
another year.
It' the performance is tho success
which its preparation merits, it is to
be repeated in Shaftsbury next week
for tho benefit of the Shaftsbury
school.
The boys and girls wish to pack high
school hall at 8 o'clock Friday even
ing and to that end appeal to all those
interested in the Bennington public
schools to purchase tickets and turn
out in full.

G.O.P. OLD BUARO

Progressive Chairman Says State
Is Flooded With Hughes Stickers
NEW PARTY NOT CONSULTED
Charge of "Cheap Politics" Laid at
Door of Those Responsible for
the Stickers.
The Banner this afternoon received
the following message from Chairman
Jackson of the Vermont state progres
sive committee:
Barre, May 15. "I have just discov
ered that some of the old guard ot the
Republican party of tills state are
again up to their old political tricks.
The ttate lias been flooded with
Hughes stickers and these have not
been issued with the sanction of the
Progressive party. Every one knows
that the Colonel has not allowed his
name to be used in any of the state
primaries and we have respected that
wish. We called the national conven
tion of the Progressive party to as
semble in Chicago at the same time
the national convention of the Repub
lican party is to assemble there.
"We took this action believing that
the surest way to secure for our coun
try the recognized leadership will be
by having. If possible, both the Pro
gressive and Republican party choose
the same standard bearer and the
Fame principles. We are confident
that the rank and file of the Republi
can party and the very large indepen
dent voter of this country will support
such an effort.
in this turning point in the world's
history we will not stick ou details.
We will lay aside partisanship and
prejudice but we will ncvr surrender
the great principles for which we
stand and have stood. We will follow
only a leader, whom we know stands
for them and is able to put them
through. ...
The Progressive party of Vermont
has not directly or indirectly issued
any stickers and in view of this fact
it was unnecessary and a piece of
cheap politics for any stickers to be
Issued by Republican politicians.

Conference Will Demand Closing of
United States Mails Against
"Booze" Advertising.
Saratoga Springs, May 14. Tho
recommendation that seven new bis
hops or general superintendents be
elected. will be made to the general
I conference of the Methodist Episcopal
j church here today, by the committee
J on episcopacy. Six of the new bishops
J will be assigned to episcopal areas in
the United States and one will be sta
j tioned at Seoul, Korea. In addition,
I two missionary bishops will be recom-
mended for work in Africa to succeed
l Bishops I. B. Scott and Joseph C.
j Hartzell. One of the missionary
bishops is to be of African descent, if
! the committee's' recommendation is
adopted. It is planned to have the
balloting for the new bishops begin to
day and continue until all of the re
quired number have received a two
thirds vote of the conference. The
committee on episcopacy, it was re
ported last night, have voted to ap
prove the proposal to unite the Metho
dist Episcopal church and the Metho
dist Episcopal church, South, the two
great branches of American Method
ism which became divided over the
question of slavery 71 years ago.
Announcement was made last night
that the committee on the state of the
church, to which was referred the
question of amusements, will report
in favor of eliminating from tho dis
cipline the prohibition against games
i of chance, theatre
attendance and .
dancing. The campaign in the com
mittee to strike out. the prohibition
against these specified diversions was
conducted, it was said, by two college
executives. Chancellor James R.. Day
of Syracuse university and President
Samuel Plantz of Lawrence university,
Appleton, Wis., who maintained that
the ban on these amusements tended
to keep the young people out ot tha
church.
One of the most important subjects
to be acted upon during the coming
week is the general statement of the
attitude of the church on the question
of temperance and prohibition. -'The
temperance committee has agreed on
a report which goes farther than the
Methodist Episcopal church has ever
gone before. Whereas four years ago
the main drive was lor the passage of
the inter-state liquor shipment bill as
the immediate national issue this re
port declares that the liquor traffic
cannot be licensed without sin and
specifically urges the immediate sub
mission by Congress of a prohibition
amendment for the action of the
states. Pending the submission and
ratification of this amendment, tha
conference wants congressional pro
hibition in all territory under tho
j jurisdiction of Congress, specifically
j including the district of Columbia. Tho
conference will also demand the clos
ing of the United States mails to all
liquor advertising.
