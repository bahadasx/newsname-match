Pct-regrnd, May 15. Developing a
swift offensive, the. Knssians smashed
across the Persian frontier southrwest
of Lake I'ruminli, within 80 miles of
the main Turkish lines of communien
tiou south of Kn grind, dispatches tie
clared today. The Slavs reached the
region of Howondii!:, Several miles in

toward Nineveh and Mosul. Un
less the Moslems check them, the Rus
sians will within a fortnight threaten
to cut off the sultan's troops checking
the British nenr,Kut-e!-Amara.
Thoro have been no developments in
the Eussinn offensive in the Caucasus
so surprising as the apeparance of an
other S'nv army near the Turks com
munications. Fur weeks the official
Communiques) have been silent with re
gard to the progress of operations
around f'rumiali. Now the secrecy is
lifted and discloses the Russians well
across the frontier, their progress ap
parently meeting with but little resist
ance. It. is believed that Grand Duke Nich
olas has outwitted the Turks and their
German tutors. Following their victor
ies at L'rzoruni and Trebizond, the Rus
sians descended upon Erzingan as if
they intended to cut off Bagdad. Con
stntinoplo rushed reinforcements to the
L'i'zingnn-Bil lis front.

"French attacks on the west slope
north of Dead Man's hill, near the ('all

the statement.
"Artitllery and patrols were active

Another Sea Mystery
iTonuinm, Wash., Mar 13. The mys

Sacramento Granges That
Have Been Dealing With
Consumers, Pleased
Sacramento, Cal., May 15. Success
for their direct marketing experiment
was claimed today by the grangers of
Sacramento county who have been oper
ating their enterprise under the Duvid
Lubiu plan of selling farm products di
rect from the country producer to the
city consumer, They expressed hope
that congress would take some actiou
recognizing the plan.
The Sacramento county grangers,
headed by Joseph Holmes, master of the
California state grange, assumed the
burden of the experiment.
After tho first eight days of opera
tion Holmes said: "There is no ques
tion in my mind about the feasibility
of tho plan. It presents unbounded pos
sibilities nnd would be a great suc
cess. ' '
During the experiment the parcel post
is not being used. Instead the grange
sends an automobile around to gather
up and distribute the products. To meet
fliis expense and other expense of oper
ation tags are sold to farmers at a rate
that would equal the parcel post charges
as set forth ia Lubiu 's bill, these fates
by the way, to be special for farmers.
Here's how it works:
The farmer mails or sends in tags
on which ho designates the products he
has for sale and the price at which he
holds them. The city housewife mails,
phones or brings in her order to the cen
tral office, payintr with coupons. The
orders arc distributed among the farm
ers and next day t lie automobile deliv
ers the products. The farmer receives
cash t the amount .of the coupons.
The grangers assert that their plan
saves housewives froai two to 10 cents
a pound on all products.
On the second dav of the experiment
four farmers had signed up. On the
eighth day 20 were on the grangers'
roll.

(I'uited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, May 13. General Hugh
Scott today presented to Secretary of
Vt ar .Baker and Secretary of Stato l.aus
ing information which will be helpful in
guiding their future course with regard
to Mexico. Scott told them that while
General Alvaro Obregon refused Mex
ican co-operation in black and white, he
offered assistance which will be helpful
if there are no outbreaks among the do.
tached Carranza garrisons.
Scott's report tended to confirm the
recent teeling of optimism with regard
to Mexico, although he included in it
the opinions of many El Paso citizens
who believe that a general Mexican
house cleaning by Americans will ulti
mately be necessary.
"General Scott is in a most optimis
tic frame of mind," said Baker, after
a brief conference, "lie seems to tlnr.Ji
that a favorable situation has been cre
ated." Because of weariness at his long jour
ney, Scott postponed his meeting with
Secretary Lansing.
The war department had no confirma
tion of reported new raids. Army men
doubted that Cnrranizstas threatened
the American communications.
Fifteen hundred Carranzistas have ar
rived near Big Bend in accordance wita
an express agreement in assisting
rounding up the Villistas who raided
Glenn Springs.
Villareal Denies Story.
Washington, May 15. Antonio Villa
real, in a letter to tho United Press, to

Designate Arreriondo that ho had in
stigated the Mexican raid on (ilem
Springs, Texas. '
"I have condemned and condemn no
with all my energy, the acts of the raid
ers since they do nothing but add to
Mexico's misfortunes." wrote Villareal.
Ho said the campaign of abuse
against him was directed because the
Aguus Cnlients convention in October,
1014, tried to elect him provisional
president. He charged: "Carranza is
trying to suppress me at any cost."

Madison Slaughter's wife took his place
in the pulpit of the Baptist church in

handful of his friends in jail here, lie
also conducted a service fdV the other
prisoners and prayed for those whom
lie termed his enemies especially mem

It is ft foregone conclusion that a

Slaughter goes before Judge Gregory
for sentence tomorrow. At tie same

the pastor be admitted to bail, pending
tho hearing for his appeal, Both mo

FRENCH M

Lieutenant Navarre Drops His
Defi Inside the German
Lines
Paris, May 13.-Lieuton nit Navarre
Fro ace s "I rear old has dropped a
second manifesto behind the German
lines, challenging l.icuntnant Iminel
man. the famous "hawk" of Germany
to an air duel for the championship of
the world.
The German flyer, ' credited with
bringing down fifteen enemy aero
planes, ignored the first challenge
dropped from the sky a month ngo.
Navarre, who has 14 air victories to
his credit, informed lmmelmnn in his
second message that he intends to make
his aeroplane the fifteenth shot down.
Allied aviators all along the western
front are wilting with tense interest
the outcome of the challenge.
n smnotli faced French
youth, has iougbf more than fifty air
duels. Through ' each encounter he
wore wrapped around his neck a silk
stocking given him by a French beauty
"for good luck."
Navarre's methods of fighting are
entirely different from those of Lieu
tenant launelman, who swoops down
upon his prey from a great height,
shooting ns lie passes but failing to
return to the nttack if the enemy aer
oplane is not brought down. The
French flier dashes straight for his
enemy, circles him, worries him with a
disconcerting fire and dives and dips
to avoid bullets. Navarre pursues if
tho enemy flees, gyrating like a bee
over and above the enemy with his
machine gun popping. A ye.ir ngo, Na
varre battled victoriously against five
enemy aeroplanes, bringing down two
and escaping unharmed. On another
occasion ho was reprimanded for es
corting a German flier whom he shot
down behind the French lfnes to a
nearby wine shop, where he treated
him to drinks.

CASEMENT TRIAL
EOR TREASON IS

Prosecution Asserts He Alone
Planned the Irish
Rebellion
PLOTTED TO LAND FORCES
ON COAST OF IRELAND
German Auxiliary Sunk, Load

By Wilbur S. Forrest
(Puited Press Staff Correspondent)
Iondon, May 15. Clad in a seedy,
dark suit with frayed sleeves. Sir
Hoger Casement, former British con
sular agent, is on trial today in the
How Street polico court on a charge of
high treason which is punishable oy
hanging. Ife entered the room smiling
md nodded to acquaintances among the
spectators. Casement's stubby, gray
beard rendered his best smile ghastly,
lie wore British army shoes.
This is the first treason case in the
Bow street court since that of Arthur
Lvneh. rebel leader after the Boer
war. The tiny courtroom was packed.
Casement was so wedged in, among at
Inches And lookers-on that he could
scarcely move. The United Press seat
for instance, was within three feet of
Sir Roger.
Daniel Bailey, a soldier arrested in
Ireland April 21, also on a chnrge of
treason, accompanied Casement to the
prisoner's dock.
Sir Roger was calm when Attorney
Genernl Sir P. K. Smith begin reading
the formal charge in which he re-
viewed the knight's life history. His
eyes roved, -occasionally resting on the
presiding magistrate then on the spec
tutors.
Claims he Planned it
Prosecutor Smith declared that Case
ment not only planned the lris.i rebel
lion, but also plotted to land severil
expeditions in Ireland, nnd .on the
Untish coast. Ho said that exchanged
English prisonors would testify to the
truth ot this assertion.
As Smith proceeded, Casement grew
fidgety. When the prosecutor said
that Casement, had been knighted for
his services in behalf of the British
government, Casement hung his head
Smith outlined Casement's capture
He reverted to the knight's activities
in Gcruuny and his endeavors to wean
imprisoned Irish soldiers away from
the cause of the allies.
Casement smiled at that and wrote
on a pad on which he was taking notes:
"They did bo at their own request.
The German auxiliary sunk off Ire
land when Casement landed carried 20,
1)00 rifles, 1,000,000 rounds of Ammu
nition, ten machine guns and many
bombs for the rebels, Smith declared
Smith asserted tnat the vast major
ity of the Irish captives treated Case
ment's overtures with contempt, where
upon they were punished and their ra
tions reduced.
"A few, unfortunately," he said,
"were seduced, including ftaniol Bai
ley." Bribed Irish Soldiers to Desert
Smith rend Bailey :s statement cor
roborating the charge of Casement hav
ing seduced imprisoned Irish soldiers in
Germany, and showing that the sub
marine in which Casement, Bailey ami
others went to Ireland was the U P.).
Police lnsieetor Parker, the first
witness, testified that Casement had
not attempted to spare himself when
arrested but had insisted that Bailey
was innocent.
John Robinson, an Irish prisoner ex
changed from a German camp, testified
that Casement offered 1100 Irishmen
in his camp $"i0 eae'n to desert.
Casement came to court from the
Tower of London in a tnxicah. He was
heavily Slurried. A 'crowd surijcri
around the tribunal demanding admit
tance. Two women were in lino at 1
n. m. By six a. m. the mob was al
most unmanageable. The police gave
hot coffee to women standing in line.
Robinson tcstifieri that fifty Irish
men accepted Casement's overtures
and enlisted in the Germ.in army.
John Cronin, an exchanged prisoner,
swore that Germany promised to trans
port these deserters to America in the
event of a German defeat.
It was observed that Casement's
shoes were without laces. This is
precautionary measure to prevent him
from committing suicide.
Bailey's Confession Read.

(United Press stnff correspondent.)
London, Mny 15. Sir Roger Case
ment's preliminary hearing on a charge
of treason u connection with the Irish
rebellion was conducted todav in the
i Bow Street police court, the crown re-
serving much evidence 'fur presentation
at the formal trial later.
Enough evidence was submitted today
to show that Casement planned to land
several expeditions in Ireland. It was
charged that the German auxiliary ves
sel ile.ttroyed while trying to reach the
irish coast carried rifles, cartridges,
Thinks War Will End
Soon and Suddenly
New York, May 15. Germany is

of James J. Hill, the railroad mignate,
today upon his return from a record

"There will not be another winter

pieces of grating, besides numerous

hastily knotted about it. Officers of
the destroyers reported seeing no traces
