Cold-Hearted Report From
Washington Senator bays
It Ain't His Affair
Where is Judge Stuart's famous let
ter of resignation?
Some weeks ago, it will be remem
bered in judicial, political and comic
section circles, Judge Stuart re
ceived from Senator Shafroth the res
ignation which he had entrusted to
the senator to be presented to the de
partment of justice "in a certain con
tingency." The supposed contingency
being the reappointment of Chief Jus
tice Robertson and Circuit Judge
Whitney, the resignation was to be
submitted but Shafroth didn't do it.
Instead, he sent it back to Judge
Stuart.
Next Judge Stuart sent the missive
on its way again, back to the Colorado
senator, to be handed to the depart
ment of justice for sure. It has been
expected for some days that the de
partment would act accordingly.
But now comes a private letter from
Washington which gives the follow
ing interesting information:
Senator Thomas received the judge's
resignation the second time but said
he was not inclined to present it to
the department of justice.
He said he was not responsible for
Judge Stuart's appointment and didn't
see why the jurist persisted in mixing
him, John F. Shafroth, up in the
judge's affairs.
He said he was inclined to send
the resignation back to Judge Stuart.
This letter from the "inside" goes
on to say that if the judge's resigna
tion ever gets presented to the de
partment, it is going to be accepted.
This latter information corresponds
with that which the Star-Bulletin's
Washington correspondent sent some
weeks ago.
. Possibly Judge Stuart'g much-travel-;
ed resignation is on its way back here

Daniel Bailey, a soldier, was arrested yesterday on a charge
similar to that in which Casement is held. Not for years has tbere
been such keen interest displayed in a court case In London. The
room and corridors were crowded w ith a tensely-absorbed audience.
It is reported that Sir Roger has made a statement to the authori
ties outlining his position, and it is believed that this will render
unnecessary mueh taking of evidence and thus shorten the hearing. '
In opening! Sir Frederick Smith, attorney-general, said that
Sir Roger had described himself as organizer of the Irish volunteers
and has impressed upon Irish prisoners in Germany, that everything
could be gained for Ireland by Germany winning the conflict.
( NOTE. Reports were sent out from London under date, of
that Sir Roger Casement had already been tried on a charge
of high treason, having been captured several days previously. It
was stated at that time that his counsel had pleaded insanity for
him and attempted to mitigate the offense. This now appears not
to have been the case, or else, following a statement taken in secret,
he is now to be publicly tried.) " ' ,
