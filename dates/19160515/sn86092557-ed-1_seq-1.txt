Structure in Dangerous
Condition.
EAST SIDE COMPLAINT
?EjSf.
? _
JayorBowen Will Inspect
Streets on That Side of
River.
With Water Commissioner Ira L.
' ^Bmith absent attending tho funeral of
/'J. R. Bennett, the city Board of Af
fairs rushed through its work this
scorning doing nothing other than
postponing work until next Monday.
The case of the LocuBt avenue citi
zens who have a grievance against'
J, h. Torrey on account of a small
structure marring the looks of tho
section In which it Is built was put
off a^aln today. The same will most
likely be done at each meeting until
(the structure falls down or until some
one gets busy and ascertains whether
j'It" can be forced out of the neighbor*
hood or no. There Ib a law covering
such things and the law is clear but
the Board does not see fit to decide
either for or against the citizens. The
Liquor Ordinance waB again passed
over until next Monday for its second
reading.
Antonio Angotti of the East side
presented a petition requesting the
gMy'.to repair the streets on that sldo
so that they may be made passable.
The street commissioner, Albert Leh
man, and Mayor Anthony Bowen will
visit tho territory (not on horse back) j
; and do whatever they can to relieve1
conditions.
Shrewsbury Miller, city engineer,
ippeared before the Board and stated I
Jiat tho South Side bridge is very
tongerous for passengers and that tho
-__,^Jatter must be looked into immedi
Jw-'^Mtely. He Informed the members of
[ commission that the I-beams un
[ air the bridge sidewalk are rusted and
i In such condition that walking across
the bridgo is very hazardous and that
Mf the matter is not looked Into Im
mediately personal injury and dam
age suits may result.
The city engineer was instructed to
?get a force of men and go to work
right away strengthening the bridge
land was also ordered to purchase new
I'beams. With the new I-beams a new
set of planks will be laid and the
bridge put into temporary good con
dition.

Many people have worked for years

/of these magnificent prizes will be
f sent to you at once.
Of course it requires a little of
yfor energy and ambition to win. No
letter; what you go after in this life,
Uways requires those qualities if
J* are to suceed. But in this case
he amount of effort to be put forth
small by comparison with the

Quite a numbor of people from Fair- >
mont and vinclnlty have already signi

Players Will Give a Parade
i Tomorrow Even
!.? ing.
Will HUD 11
Hoped That Mayor Bowen
Will Pitch First
Ball.
With new uniforms and armed with
ill the weapons and trappings of the
sport the baseball players ot the new
V. M. C. A. league will parade the
streets tomorrow evening before the
first game of the schedule is called,
betweon the Indians and Yankees, it
the present plans of the officials are
carried out. Arrangements are being
perfected today by the Y. M. C. A.
officials whereby the opening game
will be one of the best attended ana
hardest fought of the season. Each
player is hoping to have the honor of
making the first run and the first
hit and the first of the various other
plays that aro commonly mentioned.
it Is hoped that Mayor Bowen will
give his endorsement to the local lea
gue by pitching the first ball. A band
will be secured to head the street
parade, if present planB are completed
and automobiles will carry the hon
orary guests of the first game. No ad
mission will be charged to this game
as the Y. M. C. A. players do not wish
to be considered as professionals, and
this will undoubtedly Insure one of
the largest crowds of the season.
The game-will start promptly at
6:30 p. m. and will easily be finish
ed before the twilight causes the ball
to be hard to, distinguish. The work
of putting (he South Side park grounds
in shape for the players will be com
pleted today and clean atractlve scats
will be furnished gratis to all of the
spectators who would rather sit down
than stand up. Every lover of the
national pastime will be welcomed at
the game and the umpire has been
selected after diligent search for a
man who will never mind what the
fans may say of him. This inaures
fair and impartial decisions on all
mooted points and gives each spec
tator the privilege to argue as much
as he likes with his neighbor so long
as no violent assaults are perpetrat*
ed. It is likely that the reserves of
the police department will be in at
tendance as has already expressed a
desire to see the game.
But Defendants Attorneys
Managed to Win Point
Another Way.
Anothor move was recorded in the
proceedings today in the trial of L. G.
Race, convicted of aiding and abetting
in the misplacement and abstraction
of funds of the Smith-Race grocery
company and the Citizens Dollar Sav
ings Bank, when the objection of the
states attorneys to the motion of At
torney Shaw for the defendant that
the record be amended to show the ab
sence of Race during a portion of the
trial, was sustained and the motion
to amend overruled by Judge W. S.
Raymond.
The affidavits that Attorney Shaw
for the defense wished to file In sup
port of the motion to amend the rec
ord were then filed as in the record to
show that the motion had been made
and overruled and the attorneys for
the defense practically gained their
point which was that the record should
finally show that Race had been absent
during the taking of some of the tes
timony. The previous motion of the
defendant's attorneys to arrest the
judgment in the case which motion
was made at the time the jury return
ed the verdict of guilty was also ov
erruled by the court and the defense
thereupon moved to set aBide the ver
dict as being contrary to the law and
evidence as shown in the record.
The date had not been set at a late
hour this afternoon for the hearing
of the argument on this latest motion,
hut it is likely that it will be finished
ias soon as possible so that Circuit
court can adjourn to prepare for the
June term. Should this latest motion
to set aside the vredict be overruled
by the court the defendants attorneys
will likely ask for a new trial. In case
this la refused an appeal will probably
be taken.

Gubernatorial C a nd i d a t e
Makes Powerful Speech
at Court House.
Makes Pointed Reference!
to Corporation Backing
Gen. Lilly.
Although buSt a few hours' notice of
his coming was given, a crowd that
almost filled the circuit court room
gathered Saturday evening to hear
Judge Ira E Robinson candidate for
the nomination for Governor on the
Republican ticket at the June prim
aries For over an hour the learned
Jurist held his audience with his ora
tor. The speech was one of the fin
est examples of above-board campaign
ing that has ever been given in this
city. The greater part of Judge Rob
inson's speech was devoted to a poli
tical sermon in which a plea was made
for higher standards In politics and
for a higher respect for the ballot.
Towards the last of his address,
Judge Robinson naturally talked a lit
tle of his own candidacy, and took oc
casion to answer &ome false rumors
which have been set afloat by the
backers of his opponent, Mr. Lilly, and
the Wheeling Register and minor
members of the Democratic press of
the state. In answering these state
ments that have been made in regard
to his candidacy, Judge Robinson
made 110 vicious tirado against his op
ponent, nor the Wheeling Register,
nor any of the supporters of Mr. Lilly;
but in a manly and dignified fash
Ion declared the statements to be
false and proceeded to give sufficient
proof to satisfy all his hearers.
"It lias been statejl. ,b^;my oppon
ent, that'should I be.elected Governor
of West Virginia, I would be dominat
ed by the present Governor. I leave
it to anyone that my past record shows
any instance of my being dominated
by. atay power or person. In certain
well-known cases, when several men
fully as keen as the present Governor
of the state, disagreed with me, I was
not dominated by their opinion but
held to jny own. I have never been
dominated by anyone In the past, and
I have sufficient confidence in my own
character to say that I do not believe
I shall be dominated in the future.
"When men Jinked with certain big
corporate , Interests of the state fight
ing for the interests of Mr. Lilly, it
would be very easy for mo to say that
should Mr. Lilly be elected Governor
of West Virginia, he would be domi
nated by the interests whose influ
ence aided in his election."
Judge Robinson flatly declared that
he was a representative of no fac
tion. He declared that he was not
the special candidate of Henry D.
Hatfield, as had been said time and
timo again by his enemies, and that
he had entered the race for Governor
at the request of men from all over
the state and representing all factions. I
Judge Robinson stated that twice be- J
fore, once In 1908 and again in 1912,1
he had declined to become a candi
date for the office, because he did not
believe that he was ripe for the high
position. When the call came this
time, Judge Robinson believed that
ho was fitted to make the race and
therefore enterod the race. 1
VOTES CHALLENGED

More than two hundred illegal voteB

mod with the county court this after
noon by Attorneys Meredith and Hay

who signed the petition asking for a
recount of the votes polled at the bond
election were also signed to the no
