BACK IN WASHINGTON
General Confers With Secre
tary Baker Makes No
Formal Report.
Washington, May 15 Major-General
Hugh L. feeott, chief of staff of the
army, returned today from his border
conferences with General Obre.gon,
hopeful tor the situation, though the
conferences resulted in no formal
agreement for cooperative action. The
chief of staff conferred with Secretary
Baker lu:t made no formal report. Sec
retary Baker said General Scott stated
he thought a favorable situation had
been created by the conference.
General Scott will see Secretary
Lansing tomorrow and meanwhile no
steps will be taken to reopen diplo
matic negotiations for a formal agree
ment with General Carranza. Secre
tary Baker indicated however, that
General Scott, thought there would be
no great delay in arriving at an un
demanding and formulating a pro
toco!. Pending the ratification of an
agreement, Carranza troops are being
mover! forward into the bandit ridden
portions of Mexico. The American ex
peditonary force under General Persh
ing is being withdrawn into strong
groups on the line of communication
where it will await the outcome of
General Ohregon's effort to clean up
the territory to the south. General
Punston has mapped out a coordinated
scheme for border patrol with the
35.000 men he will soon have availa
ble for that purpose, exclusive of the
34.000 or so in General Pershing's
column.
On his return today from El Paso
Major-General Scott, chief of staff, had
a detailed report of his protracted con
ferences with General Obregon, Car
ranza's war minister, to present to
President Wilson, Secretary Bak
er and Secretary Lansing. Offici
al were anxious to learn precisely
why the Mexican general declined to
sign an agreement covering operation
of American troops in Mexico, particu
larly in view of official notification
that General Carranza had approved
the original draft of the protocol.
Genera! S'-ott's discussions with of
ficials probabiy will occupy several
days. .Not nntil Lhey are completed
will diplomatic conferences be arrang
ed with Eliseo Arredomdo, Mexican
ambassador designate, on the disposi
tion of American troops and the vexa
tious questions of protecting the Amer
ican bandit raids.
Conccntratim? Troops.
The war department today had a
report from General Pershing saying
the new concentration of troops or
dered by General Funston after the
Kl Paso con fere nee, was being con
dmled satisfactorily. This was in
terpreted as meaning the supply lines
were being shortened. There were no
indications today that the national
guard of any other states would be
railed nut soon to strengthen the bor
der patrols.

M. i. EHERIER, Local Forecaster,
Negro Slayer
Is Burned to
DeathbyMoh
Waco, Texas, May 13. With 15,000
persons as witnesses, including women
and children. Jesse Washington, negro
boy, who confessed to the criminal as
saulting and murder of Mrs. Lucy
FYyar, seven miles south of here last
Monday afternoon, was taken from the
fifth court district room shortly be
fore noon today and burned on the
public square.
The burning came tarmediatery aft
er the negro's trial had ended and
after the jury had returned a verdict
of guilty, giving him the death pen
alty. Some one not far from the
negro started the cry of "get the
negro."
It was taken up by all of those from
that part of the county where Mrs.
FYyar was killed and Washington
was then seized and removed from the
court room.
The mob at first seemed willing to
hang the negro from the suspension
bridge, but a suggestion that he be
burned on the plaza met with instant
response and he was dragged to the
city hall yard, where the chain al
ready around his neck was thrown
over the limb of a tree and the fire
started.
When the flames had subsided
somewhat some one in the mob cut
off the negro's fingers and other parts
of his body.
FRAMING PROTEST
TO GREAT BRITAIN
Washington, May 15. The American
government is preparing a protest
characterized by officials as "very vig
orous" against the interference with
mails to and from the United States
by Great Britain. A note to be sent
forward in the near future will take
the position that the United States can
no longer countenance seizure and de
tention of mails to and from the Unit
ed States, particularly those concern
ing neutrals.
The reply recently received from
Great Britain to the last American
note protesting against interference
with American mails is considered
unsatisfactory. - -
Protests have been made to the gov
ernment by many individuals and
firms who have been injured by the
frequent long delays to which mails
between Europe and the United States
have been subjected.
The subject is under detailed study
at the state department. President
Wilson will inform the British gov
ernment that the United States con
siders it imperative that the present
British policy be modified.

BOMB DESTROYS
BUILDER'S HOME
Explosive Toder Torch Wrecks House
of Chicago Contractor Blame
Labor Troubles.
Chicago, May 15. The home of Pat
rick Dignan, a contractor, was partly
wrecked by a bomb early this morn
ing, the porch being blown off, win
dows broken and plaster knocked from
the walls. The bomb, thought by the
police to have been made of dynamite,
was placed under the porch at the
front of the house.
Persons living in the house were
badly bruised and thrown from their
beds but none was seriously injured.
The police believe the act was the re
sult of labor troubles, windows m
buildings in adjoining blocks were
broken by the force of the explosion.
Dignan was recently acquitted of
the murder of George Hammond, busi
nes agent of the Excavator's and As
phalt Teamsters' union.
Dignan shot and killed Hammond
in 1914, after they had quarreled and
when the latter was about to shoot
the contractor, according to che de
fense. Dignan alleged that Hammond
had attempted to extort money from
him and had called strikes on him
when he failed to pay the business
agent. This led to the fight in which
Hammond was killed.

REBEL CHIEF
PUT ON TRIAL
FOR TREASON
Sir Roger Is Arraigned Be
fore Police Magistrate
of Bow Street.
LEADER OF REVOLT
Prisoner Is Charged With
Being the Instigator of
Irish Rebellion-
London, May 15, f!0:45 a. ttl) Sir1
Roger Casement, the supposed head!
and prime instigator of the Sinn Fein,
rebellion in Ireland, was arraigned to-;
day in the Bow Street police court and!
charged with high treason. ,
The few spectators who were per
mitted to enter the famous old polices
court were considerably surprised)
when a second prisoner was placed be-,
side Casement in the dock. This manj
was Daniel Julian Bailey, a private:
soldier, whose home is at Wembley, a'
village near London. Bailey was ar-:
rested near Aralee, Ireland, on April!
21. He was jointly charged with.
Casement with high treason, but his;
exact connection with the Sinn Fein-'
ers has not so far been made public '
In the formal charge Casement is
described as of no fixed abode. Thei
charge against defendents reads:
Charged With High Treason.
"For that they did between the Crsti
day of November, 1914 and oh divers:
other occasions between that day end,
the 21st day of April, 1916, unlawfully.,
malicionsly and traitorously commit;
high treason within and without the
realm of England in contempt of our
sovereign lord, the king and his laws,
to the evil example of others in like
case and contrary to the duty and al
legiance of the said defendents." Case
ment is reported to have made a long
statement to the authorities and it is
believed that this statement will con
siderably shorten the hearing before
the magistrate. The police court hear
ing is merely a preliminary to the real
trial, which will take place later be
fore a panel of the judges of the high
court of justice,
CasemeLt Greatly Changed.
Attorney General Sir Frederick E.
Smith, A. H. Bodkin and Ttavers
Humphreys appeared for the prosecu
tion and Professor J. H. Morgan and
Artemus Jones for the defendents. Sir
John Dickinson presided.
Shortly after the magistrate had
taken his seat, Casement and his fel
low prisoners were shown into the
dock. Casement's appearance was
vastly different from that of the man
who gained fame in 1912 by his ex
posure of the cruelties practiced on
natives in Piitumavo bv a British rub
ber company. He sat in the dock
resting his chin on his hand and oc
casionally looking toward the magis
trate. When the attorney general, in open
ing the case for the prosecution, men
tioned the conferring of the order ot
knighthood on Casement the prison
er dropped his head. The attorney
general then outlined the prisoner's
career.
Bailey Tells Leader's Role,
In opening the case for the crown,
the attorney general charged that
Casement had conducted a systematic
campaign among the Irish prisoners
in Germany with the purpose of se-;
ducing them from their allegiance.
Bailey, he said, had been seduced in
this manner and had made a state
ment explaining Casement's actions in
detail.
According to the attorney general.
Bailey was born in Dublin and joined
the royal Irish rifles in 1904. He
served with his regiment in India and
was honorably discharged. On the
outbreak of the European war Bailey
was called out. as a reservist anil
sailed with the original expeditionary
force to France. He was takea pris
oner in September, 1914.
The attorney general said Bailey
had related how a large number ot
Irish prisoners had been collected
from various prisons in Germany nd
placed in a large camp at Limburg.
There they heard addresses by Case
ment, who tried to inflame their minds
against the British government and
persuade them to break their oaths of
allegiance and support him in his
projected expedition to Ireland.
The attorney general said Casement
