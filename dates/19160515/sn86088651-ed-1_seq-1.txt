The writer has been over consld

rains of Monday and Tuesday last.
Ami, while he kr.ors the: the rain as
a great blessing, for it came when
the land wae getting Tery dry. yet
with all the blessing that It brought.
It was accompanied by one very ser

disadvantage that he wishes to con
fine himself In this article. In all the
forty odd years that he has teen fa
miliar with the seasons In Itrazos
Cpunty. he does' not believe that he
ever saw any one rain (hat was any
more destructive to the' soil. The
erosion raused from tills rain Is some
thing awful and should Impress Itself
en the minds of every farmer In
llraxoa County In such a manner that
he would set about devising wars and
means by which this erosion can be
stopped. As I see It. and as I have
before stated In several different ar
ticles. It is or should be the first, the
most Important as well as the most
serious problem to be solved by every
hill land farmer In Brazos County.

until they really become alarmed oe
the situation to the extent of determ
ining that they will set about In an
effort to Improve and maintain their
soil. I repeat that there It only one
hope of Itrazos County ever being a
prosperous country any more, and that
will .come after his soils have been
Improved.
When we say that this soli ran be

crops, by growing soil-building plsnts.
we are talking about reasonable facts
and something that ran be done by

and In sections of some of the older
Southern States. Soils that were worn
completely out many years ago are
now completely restored and are pro

before.
The demonstration agent will run
these levels and lay off these terraces
for any farmer In the county without
one cent of cost. Of course It will
cost some labor to build these ter
races as they should be built, but the
cost Is nothing compared to the bene

at such little cost. I don't know how
any sensible man could go into hi:
field after this big rain and see the
terrible destruction wrought on his
soil and be contented to go and plow
up more soil for the next rain to wash
away, and not mnke some effort In
terracing to save this soil before It Ih
completely gone. Espe ially Is this
puzzling to me when he knows there
is a remedy and the remedy is with
in his reac h. Then we remember
that this soil Is about the only source
of Income that the average farmer
has, and still worse, It Is about all
the heritage he will have to leave to
his children.
