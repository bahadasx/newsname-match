SUICIDE IS HIS DEFENSE.
Forty-eight of First Fifty Tales
men Excused-T-Selection
Will Be Slow.
WAUKKGAN, Ills., May IC.-As tho
trial of William H. Orpet, uccused of
the murder of Marian Lnmbert, got
under way this afternoon In the Lake
County Court, It appeared that prac-
tlcnlly the entire panel of 131 Jurors
summoned would be excused. Tales
man after talesman presented reasons
ranging trom opinions on tho rase to
Illness in the family.
At 2 o'clock, on hour after tho
college youtli.had entered the court
Worn' fifty talesmen had been ques
tioned by Judgo Donally and forty
eight of them were excused.
Orpet, looking pale and much thin
ner than tho day he was urrcstcd at
Madison, was accompanied by his
father and mother as he entered the
court room, which wns Jammed to
suffocation.
For tho first few minutes he stood
In the rear of tho Judge's seat, whis
pering with his parents. Ills mother,
garbed In blue, with a heavy blue
veil concealing her face, whispered
to him frequently and patted his
shoulder affectionately.
Tho mystery that surrounded tho
love anu aoath of Marian, a pretty
high school girl, whose body was
found Feb. 10 In Helms Woods, at
Lake Forest, has resolved itself Into
tho question of murder or suicide,
which must bo answered by the Jury
which will try Orpot us tho girl's
slayer.
Orpet, a Junior at tho University of
Wisconsin, has strndfastly maintained
his Innocence slnco ho was Jailed Feb.
11. It is his contention Murlan com
mitted sulcido.
State's Attorney J. Dady, who Is
leading tho prosecution, bases his
easo on tho theory that Orpet gavo
Marian cyanldo of potassium, pre
tending to her that It was medicine.
The defence, led by former United
States District Attorney James WI1
keison, planned to-day to contest
every bit of circumstantial evidence
Dady will produce.
Marian was eighteen years old. She
and young Orpet had been friends
since childhood. Orpet was twenty
one only a few weeks ago. He had
planned to marry Miss Cclestla
Youker. daughter of a minister at
Barrington, 111., un Instructor In
chemistry at tho Stato Normal School
at DeKalb.
After arranging an alibi to conceal
tho fact that he had left Madison,
Orpot went to Laka Forest On the
night of Fob. 8. Tho next morning
Orpet mot Marian by appointment In
tho woods, told hor Tie was "through"
and was going to murry Miss Youker.
Marian, Orpet declared, sobbed,
called him back, and evidently swal
lowed poison when ho refined to re
turn. At any rnto, ho declares, sho
fell to tho snow-clad ground, and
when ho reached tier side she was
dying. The boy admitted ho fled
back to Madison and mado every ef
fort to conceal his departure.
Marian, Orpet stated, had told him
sho was fearful of hor condition. An
autopsy showod there was no basis
for her fear. Friends of Marian
stated that she had admitted to them
sho knew sho was not In tho condi
tion sho told Orpot.
