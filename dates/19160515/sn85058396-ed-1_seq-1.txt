BEFORE COURT
Prime Investigator of Sinn
Fein Rebellion Charged
With High Treason
SECOND ONE ARRAIGNED
Daniel Julian Bailey, Private
Soldier, Jointly Charged
With Sir Roger.
London, May 15. 10-45 a, m Sir
Roger Casement, the supposed head
and prime instigator of the Sinn Fein
rebellion in Ireland, was arraigned
todajr In police court and charged
with high treason.
The few spectators who were per
mitted to enter the famous old Bow
street police court were considerably
surprised when a second prisoner was
placed beside Casement in the dock.
This man was Daniel Jullian Bailej',
a private soldier whose home is at
Wembley, a village near London. Bai
ley was arrested near Tralee, a Lon
don suburb yesterday. Ho was joint
ly charged with Casement with high
treason, but his exact connection with
tho Sinn Felners has not so far been
made public.
In the formal charge Casement is
described as of no occupation and of
no fixed abode. The charge against
both defendant reads: For that they
did between the first day of Novem
ber, 1914, and on divers other occa
sions between that day and the 21st
day of April, 1916, unlawfully, ma
liciously and traitorouslj' commit high
treason within and without tho realm
of England in contempt of our Sov
ereign Lord the king and his laws,
to the evil example of others in like
case and contrary to the duty and al- :
leglance of the said defendants."
Casement is reported to have made
a long statement to the authorities i
and It is. believed that this statement
will considerably shorten the hearing
before tho magistrate. The police
court hearing Is merely a preliminarj- i
to the real trial which will take place
later before a panel of the judges of
tho high court of justice.
Sir John Dickinson presided.
Shortly after the magistrate had
, taken his seat, Casement and his fel
low prisoner were shown into the
dock. Casement's appearance was
i vastly different from that of the mar
who gained fame in 1912 by his ex
posure of the cruelties practiced or
natives In PutumaycK,bya British rub
ber company. He" sat in the dock rest
ing his chin on his hand and occa
sionally looking toward the magls
trale.
When1 the attorney general, in open'
ing the case for the prosecution, men
tioned the conferiug of the Order oi
Knighthood on Casement the prisoner
dropped his head. The attorney gen
eral then outlined the prisoner's ca
reer. Systematic Campaign Conducted.
In tho opening of tho case for the
crown, the attorney general charged
that Casement had conducted a sys
tematic campaign among the Irish
prisoners in Germany with the purpose
of seducing them from their allegi
ance. Bailey, he said, had been se
duced in this manner and had made
a sla'emont explaining Casement's
actions in detail.
According to the attorney general,
Bailey was born in Dublin and joined
the Royal Irish Rifles in 1904 He
served with his regiment in India and
was honorably discharged. On the
outbreak of the European war Bailey
was called out as a reservist and sail
ed with the original expeditionary
force to France. He was taken pris
oner in September, 1914.
The attorney general said Bailey
had related how a large number of
Irish prisoners had been collected
from various prisons in Germanic and
placed in a large camp at Limburg.
There they heard addresses by Case
ment who tried to Inflame their minds
against the British government and
persuade them to break their oats of
allegiance and support him In his pro
jected expedition to Ireland.
The attorney general said Casement
described himself as the organizer of
tho Irish volunteers, and impressed
linnn fit.-. Tt.lr.1-. !-. 3 rAmnn,.
that everything was to bo gained
for Ireland by Germany's winning
the war. Those prisoners who joined
a brigade he was attempting to form,
were promised by Casement, the at
torney general assorted, that they
would be sent to Berlin as guests of
the German government. In the
event that Gormanj' won a sea bat
tle he would land the brigade In Ire
land to defend that country against
England, and if Germany lost the war
the German government would give
each man $10 to ?20 and free pass
age to America.
Casement Knighted In 1911.
This is tho plan conceived in 1915,
said tho attorney general, by tho man
who in 1911 was bagging Sir Edward
Grey to convey his deep appreciation
to the king of the honor of knight
hood which had just been conferred
on him.
When the speaker added that Case
ment's offer was treated with con
tempt by a vast majority of the Irish
prisoners, Casement smiled and
glanced toward Bailey.
Details of Treachery.
Sir Frederick Smith fonvarded the
story of Casement's alleged machin
ations in Berlin with details of his
trip by submarine to Tralos, where
ho landed on Good Friday with Bailey
and a third man named Monteith, who
is still at large. He also told of the
sending of a ship wIth 20,000 rifles
from Germany to Tralee and of how
this ship was sunk at Tralee and the
crew was captured.
The attorney general here intro
duced a dramatic touch by having
brought Into the court a green rebel
flag, which ho said Casement had
brought from Germany to Ireland.
i'or a moment the prisoner sat with
eyes fixed on the floor, refusing to
look at this emblem of tho rebellion.
I hen ho glanced up at the flag and
smiled derisively. Most of tho time
during the attorney general's address
no sat with his elbow on his knee,
stroking his beard a characteristic
pose of the prisoner ever since his in
carceration in the Tower of London.
He appeared oblivious of his sur
roundings but occasionally ho glanced
up qulcklj. showing he was listening
to the proceedings, notwithstanding
his apparent Inattention.
Tho calling of witnesses for tho
crown began immediately after Sir
Frederick concluded his address. Sir
Roger began to take a more lively
interest in the proceedings. He seized
a pad of paper which had been pro
vided for him and started to take
notes of the testlmonj'.
Bailey Makes Statement.
A statement from Bailey was read
by tho attorney general. Bailey said
he joined tho Irish brlgado at the
suggestion of Casement to see
whether It would be possible to get
out of Germanj'. After a visit to the
German foreign office he said, he
was told to make ready to depart
and was taken on board tho subma
rine U-19.
When he sighted Tralee he was
told the visit was In connection with
tho volunteer movement. He was
transferred to a collapsible boat as
the submarine neared the coast. Tho
boat overturned as it reached the surf.
He had to wade ashore and then went
back to the boat for arms.
Bailey said he and Casement reach
ed Traleo and that Casement went
into the shop of a news agent and in
quired whether the commanding offi
cer had arrived. He was answered in
the negative. Bailey got into a motor
car in which he was arrested.
After the formal evidence had been
given by the police as to the reading
of the charge to Casement and Bailey
in the Tower of London, Casement
arose and said:
Bailey Declared Innocent.
"Well, that man (pointing to Bai
ley), is innocent. I think the indict
ment is wrongly drawn against him."
Casement then offered to procure
counsel to defend Bailey, who he
3aid, was without means.
The first witness was John Robin
son of Belfast, formerly a corporal in
the Roval Armv Medical corns who
was one of the prisoners taken to Ger
many in the early stages of the war
and recentlj' was released. He said
that of four thousand Irish prisoners
gathered at Limburg to hear Case
ment's exhortations, between fifty and
sixty joined the Irish brigade.

Rockefeller Urges Campaign.
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., addressing
today's session of the International
convention of the Young Men's Chris- H
tian Association of North America, M
urged a campaign to bo called, "Tho
Every-Christlan-Man-At-Work Move- H
ment." M
Multitudes of men whose names ap-
pear on the church roles as Christians fl
are merely marking time, said Mr. M
Rockefeller, like soldiers parading tho M
streets In dress uniform instead of M
rendering active service like the men H
in khaki. H
Calls on Ministers. M
Christian manhood, like muscular or M
mental power, is only to be maintained M
by its use," he said. "I call upon the H
ministers of this land to rouse to ac- M
tion that vast horde of Christian men H
enrolled in the church but seldom seen M
in the pews, who are only waiting for fl
some service which requires manly M
qualities In order to be again brought M
into active reatlon with tho churches. fl
"As we face the great industrial ,
problems which are arising dally, it
seems clear that the only hope of their M
permanent and satisfactory solution
lies in tho widespread acceptance of iH
the doctrine of the brotherhood of jH
man. When men of widely separated j
stations are thrown together, come to '
know each other, to admire the strong H
and manly qualities which they see H
in each other, when they are working
side by side for the advancement of M
a common Interest, then only does per- H
sonal distrust, hatred and misunder- H
standing give way to a spirit of fair jH
play, justice, and a desire for tho
common good." jH
