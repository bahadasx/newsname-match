ancy. May 14. President Potncsre,
In an address today, responded to
Oermany's declaration regarding
peace contained in the German reply
to the American note.
"France docs not want Germany to
tender peace," said the president,
1ut wants her adversary to ask for
peace."
The president then made known
clearly the only kind of peace which
would bo acceptable to Franc e. The
address was delivered at the Molltor
garrison before a largo number of
Lorraine refugees, to whom the
president, after expressing his sym
pathies and renewing promises of sol
idarity and protection, said:
Will Not Kspose Positions.
"France will not expose her posi
tions to the. dangers of new aggres
sions. Tho central empires, haunted
by remorse for having brought on the
war, are terrified by the indignation
and hatred they have stirred up In
mankind, and are trying today to
make the world believe that the en
tente allies alone are responsible for
the prolongation of hostilities a dull
irony which will deceive no one.
"Neither directly nor indirectly
have our enemies offered us peace.
Bat we do not want them to offer it
to us; we want them to nsk it of us.
We do not want to submit to their
conditions; we want to impose ours
on them. .Wo do not want a peace
which would leave imperial Germany
With the power to recommence the
war and keep Europe eternally me
naced. We want peace which re
ceives from restored rights serious
guarantees of equilibrium and stabil
ity. Kays France is Resolute.
"So long as that peace is not as
sured to us; so long as our enemies
will not recognize themselves as van
quished, we will not cease to fight."
President Polnoare told the refu
gees that they were only a small
number of the victims of the Inva
sion; these were distributed in all
parts of the country and there was
not a department that was not shel
tering thousands. Everywhere they
were waiting with calm confidence
for the hour of deliverance.

San Antonio, Tex., May 14. Major
General Frederick Funston today be
gag the consideration of a plan for
i he reorganisation of tin- border pa
trol. Itelleved of diplomatic respon
sibilities and having under his dlroat
control almost f0,000 men, he out
lined to his staff a redistribution of
the force that he believed would
guarantee the protection of American
residents from Mexican raiders.
Already forces at border stations
have been strengthened and indica
tions today were that before the end
of the week the greater part of the
regular troops and mllltla that have
been sent Into tne three border states
would be in shape and In position for
quick service along the International
iim
General Officers in Comma ml
General officers will be In charge
of the patrol districts. The district
OOmtnanderi Include Brigadier Gen
eral James Purker. commanding the
I'irst cavalry brigade; Brigadier Gen
eral William A. Mann, commanding
the Second brigade at Uiredo, Tex.,
and Brigadier General II. A. Greene,
who has been ordered to report at
headquarters here from Kort Leaven
worth.
It Is Improbable that more troope
will ho sent to Colonel Sib ey. who Is
In charge of the little, expedition that
CroeSed itttO Mexico near Hoqulllas Be
I result of tbe raid at Glenn Springe
and Boqulllas a week ago. Four
troops of cavalry rind a machlno gun
detachment are now operating closs
: tg the line, eCOUtlng through a limited
! territory south of (ho border, but
tiler,, never has been any intention of
sending foi ward at that point a puni
tive expedition that would compare
In size with that of General Pershing
In the state of Chihuahua. If the
cavalry that is operating south of
Itoqulllus fails to locate any h. null's
within a few days, Its return to sta
tions north of the line Is probable.
Army officers here ore deeply ln-
' forested, however, In the efforts the
Mexican troops were reported to be
milking to run down the bandits who
rubied the Ulg Bend district and who
yet hold as prisoner Jesso Deomers,
the American Store keeper. It Is re
garded here as not Impossible that
the Mexican troops may cut off the
retreat towards the Interior of the
bandits and force them back Into the
lines of Colonel Sibley's cavalry.
Iteports from General Pershing to
day were characterized as merely rou
tine. Since the negotiations between
Genera's BCOtt snd Funston and Gen
eral Gbregon and Subsecretary Ama
dor began at Kl Paso, General Persh
ing h is mad,, no effort to prosecute
the campaign against Villa. Ills forces
have been withdrawn until hlB entire
column of more than 1 4,000 men Is
almost a compact unit.
FttnstOn Investigates Fires.
With the exception of the attempt
lo destroy a part of the buildings at
Kort BllM lust night, no unusual In
cidents were reported to general
headquarters today. General Hell re
porting the fires to General Funston
expressed the opinion that the fires
were of Incendiary origin. General
Kunston ordered an investigation.
With the exception of the Thir
teenth and Third Infantry, one bat
talion of the Third field artillery and
one company of coast artillery, all the
additional troops ordered to report to
General Kunston have arrived. Tho
Thirteenth and Third were reported
today to have entrnlned at their sta
tions In New York state. The Third
: will be sent tn Kuglo I'ass, but It has
not yet been decided Just where tha
Thirteenth will be stationed.
Four of the eleven companies of
const artillery brought here have been
sent to border stations. The remain
der have been mobilised at Fort 8am
Houston. The mllltla mobilisation at
Douglas, Columbus, and here, was
completed today. Here there are en
camped three regiments of Texas ml
lltla, a squadron of cavalry, a battery
of field artillery and a field hospital
r oinpuny of the militia.
