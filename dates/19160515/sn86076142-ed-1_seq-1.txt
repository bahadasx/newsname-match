Bad Man Stabbed in Side
During a Sunday Fight,
1 . And May Not Recover
Nick Milanovlcli la In the comity
hospital suffering from a serious stab
wound jUi the left side that penetrated
the lung and caused a profuse hemorr
hage. Nick lloscovlch, owner of the
Miners' Home bur, and Dan Roscovich
are held in the county Jail awaiting
the result o' the injuries.
The trouble occurred In the Miners'
Home bar Sunday afternoon about
2:30 o'clock when Milanovlch became
Involved In a quarrel with the owner
of the house. Milanovich has a bad
reputation as he Is reputed to be a
gun man and Inst February was sent
to the county Jail for six months for
shoot ing another. ' Owing to his phy
sical oondition the prisoner was parol
ed and allowed to go to San Francisco
for treat inent. He returned recently
and begun hanging around his old
haunts with the supposed object of
getting even for having been sent to
Jail. Under the circumstances the
Boscovlchea took no chances and, as
Boon as trouble started, both men
ailed Into Milanovich. Dan Rosco
vich is alleged to have used a heavy
billiard cue on the head of the dis
turber while Nick is accused of draw
ing and using a keen edged knife
which entered between,) the eighth
and ninth ribs causing a three Inch
incision directly into the lung.
The injured man created a sensa
tion as he fled from the place con-red
with blood flowing from Ills side
and saturating his clothing. Ho went
to the office of Dr. Mcl.eod in the
Hank building dashing ;uto the place
demanded treatment. The blood by
this tlme,was gushing forth lit a per
fect torrent and consequently the doc
tor's premises looked like a sham
bles. A costly rug in the reception
room waB ruined and blood splashed
over the wainscoting. Dr. McLeod, in
addition to the knife thrust, found the
man suffering from a bad contusion
on the head where the cue landed,
but there was no fracture. The
wounds are not serluus unless septic
I pneumonia should set In.

vlch are held as witnesses.
HUGH H. BROWN IS GOING 10 1
TO ATTEND THE LEAGUE TO
G
ENFORCE PEACE
Hugh 11. Brown leaves Tuesday
morning for the east. Mrs. Brown,
who Is now on the coast, will Join
him in Reno and will accompany hlrt5
to the Chicago convention, where he
goes as a Nevada delegate. After the
Chicago convention, they will go to
the Democratic convention in St.
Louts, as spectators. The Chicago
convention begins June 7th. The St.
Louis convention begins June 14th.
Before going to the conventions,
Mr. and Mrs. Brown will go to Wash
ington to attend. the sessions of the
League to Enforce Peace. Both of
them are members of the league. The
sessions will he held In Washington
during the last wek In May. Former
President Taft will preside. Many
men of mtllouul prominence will de
liver addresseH and participate In the
discussions. The league to enforce
peace is a world-wide movement. The
organization Is under way In a num
ber of other countries. The American
branch was organized a year ago.'
This movement does not particular
ly concern Itself with the present war.
It has no plans for stopping the pre
sent war. The preliminary purpose of
the organization is to devise a con
federation among the leading nations
whereby the prospect of future wars
will be minimized. In regard to this
work, Mr. Brown said:
"The main idea is this: It iB
proposed to make various nations en
ter into an arrangement to the effect!
that an international dispute shall be
HALT TO WAIT
FOR MORE III
submitted to a conference of the
powers before any offended nation
shall take up artus against another
nation. If the offended nation shall
take up arms against another nation,
without first submitting the question
in controversy, then such action shall
be tantamount to a declaration of war
against all the other signatory nations.
All the signatory nations undertake
and stipulate that they will Jointly
and aggregately take up arms against
any nation so offending. There is lit
tle use in trying to stop a conflict
after it has begun; but there Is much
hope of diminshing the cases where
international dissentlona shall here
after lead to fighting and it ts against
the outbreak of future wars that the
proposed league toocnfore peace is ex
clusively aimed.
"Moreover a prospect of Immediate
universal war is the one thing that
would be sure to deter any country,
however powerful or self-sustaining,
from beginning hostilities with its
neighbor. It is almost inconceivable
that any nation would attack another
if convinced that to do so would in
volve war with all the leading powers
of the world. If, therefore such a
league as is proposed were formed by
a sufficient number of great countries,
it Is in the highest degree improbable
that the agreement to take up arms
would ever need to be put into ex
ecution; for although there may be is
sues on which a nation would rather
periHhJhan yield, there are none on

G'wENN SPRINGS EXPEDITION CAN

REINFORCEMENTS

MARATHON, May 15.-The expedi

which it would prefer a public hear
ing before fighting its adversary, to
fighting a whole array of powerful
states without such a hearing.
"Most plans for the maintenance of
peace among nations start with the
idea of compelling the arbitration of
disputes. This one starts from a dif
ferent standpoint, that of preventing
sudden war by force. It is the method
pursued in the case of Individuals
within a community. The state does
not compel a man to bring suit for
an injury If he does not want to do
so. It merely tells him that be must
not resort to force; must not take re
dress into his own hands, on pain of
punishment by the whole force of the
community. So this plan does not tell
a nation that it must submit disputes
to arbitration and abide by the result,
but that it must on on pain of repres
sion by all the members of the league
go to war before the mutter has been
submitted to an international tribun
al council."
In conclusion Mr. Brown said:
"The name of this organization
signifies the fundamental theory that
is back of it. It is a league to enforce
peace. Kven if it should not produce
any practical results for many years
to come, yet it seems to be a com
mendable theory to work upon. In
these times, any plan which seems
to give some promise of better Inter
national conditions, is worthy to en
gage our interest and our co-operation.

If the five score Elks from Tonopah
Round Mountain, Manhattan and Mll-

wreeked in fording Currant Creek on
the road to the reunion at Ely they
will have the doubtful satisfaction of
seeing the material for he bridge to
be erected at the creek placed on ex
hibition at Ely. The structural steel
is due to arrive there by the fifteenth
of May and It will then take from two
to three weeks to complete the struc
ture. Some concrete work has to be
done before the steel can be swung!
into place so It is safely estimated j
that the bridge will be opened to the
public by the first of June. i
The contract was let to a Mlnne-
spoils company six weeks ago and thei
I materials were shipped last week. It
is needless to say that this Mlnnepolis
j firm never paid one cent to the up
j build of Nye county and doesn't give
a dam for its future.
