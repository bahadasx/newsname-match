POISON SALES (
MURDER CLUE
'olice Declare Mrs. Amy Arch
er Gilligan Bought Three
Pounds of Acids.
a
AST PURCHASE MADE JUST e
PRIOR TO ALLEGED CRIME
By the International News Service.) h
Hartford. Conn., May 14.-Mrs. Amy
kreher Gilligan, It was discovered today'
n
)urchased a large quantity of arsenic
hree days before the death of her second a
usband, Michael W. Gilligan. This isc
:onsidered by the police as one of the
-nost important links in the chain of
vidence they declare is In their pos
tession.
Mrs. Gilligan is a prisoner in the Hart
'Ord County Jail, charged with having
%aused the death of Franklin R. Andrews,
who was an inmate of her Home for
Elderly People at Windsor.
Although she is being held on the single
harge, States Attorney Hugh M. Alcorn
ntimates that a "murder factory" was
being operated there. There have been t
rorty-eight deaths in the home in five
/ears.
The poison-sale record of W. H. P.
Wason, a druggist of Windsor, shows
hat Mrs. Gilligan bought at least three t
pounds of deadly poisons there since
3eptember 11, 198. The State and police d
Luthorities who have been investigating x
:he case for two years, are in possession F
)f this data.
The two purchases which the authori
ties consider most vital in the present
stage of the ever-widening probe, were
nade in 1914. On February 17. Mrs. Gilli
gan, according to the "poison book,"
)ought ten ounces of arsenic acid. The
Jurpose of its use was jotted down on a
he record as "for rats." I
On February 20, 1914. exactly three days' ~
ater. Mr. Giligan died, according to the
olice, in "great agony." He had signed
will the night before, leaving all his
yroperty to his wife. It was not admit-d
ed on a technicality.
The next sale shows that on May 26' ~
914, four days before the death of Frank-n
in Rt. Andrews, in connection with which
d{rs. Gilliga# was arrested, she bought a
.wo ounces of arsenic, also "for rats."

flmternational News Service.
Paris, May 14.-The most signiflcaet
pronouncement made by Presid-nt Poin
:are since the beginning of the war was
ittered by him today at Nancy. the
apital of French Lorraine.
Replying to the reference to peace pro
posals contained in the Kaiser's rerly to
the American ultimatum. President Poin
,are, who was addressing a body of
Lorraine refugees, said:
"The Central Empires, haunted by re
mnorse at having begun th:s war. and
affrighted by the indignation and hAtred
which th-y have aroused amongc human
iind, are today attempting to make the
world believe that the allies alone are
'esponsible for the prolongation of hos
tilities.
"This is ponderous irony that deceives
no one. Neither directly or indirectly
have our enemies offered us terms of
peace. But we do not want them t o: -
rer us eae; we want them to ask us
ror peace. We do not want to submit to
their conditions: we want to enforce our
rwn. We do not want a peace that will
eave imperial Germany the mistress to
begin another war and hang as an eter
nal menace over Europe; we want a peace
that will bring restoration of rights and
that will carry with it guarantees of
equilibrium and stability.
"So long as this peace Is not assured
to us and so long as our enemies will
not admit they are defeated, we shall
not cease fighting.'
