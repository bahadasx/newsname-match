Alleged Conspirator in Irish Rebellion Brought to
; r Bar in Police Court Proceedings Calm As
. Charge is Read Another Prisoner Placed ya
1 Dock on Same Count Throngs See Green
Flag of the Rebellion Laid Before Leader in
Court.
' n ,Londonj May 15 Sir Roger Casement, who only a few
s Vars achieved international fame for the services. he rend
ered his government in the exposure of the Putumayo rubber
atrocities, today faced the bar in an ordinary police court for a
preliminary examination ' to determine whether he should be
held for trial on the charge of high treason against the same
government in connection with the rebellion in Ireland. Be
side Casement stood Daniel Julian Bailey who faced a similar
charge. , -; .
Not ill' many years nas so mucn
-nnnninr (nton9t been manifested in
a case before the courts. This is due1
not only to the prominence of Case
ment and to speculation as to his ul
timate fate, tout "also because it has
been expected evidence would be pro
duced which would lay bare a wide
spread plot resulting in the revolt.
Long before the hour . set for the
hearing:, crowds 'began to gather out
eide the Bow street court, hoping to
gain admittance or at, least to have a
glimpse of -the man alleged to have
been the moving spirit in the 't con
spiracy. ; ,
There was an ' -unexpected number
of applications for seats in the little
courtroom' but admission was restrict
ed -io about 100 persons, " includtag
represenaves of the press. Among
the, earliest arrivals in toe court was
sir TTnnuiii Plunkett. Co thaw depart -
' ment of agriculture" In Ireland. He
took a seat near the magistrate. It
was ' understood Sir ; Horace , was
merely a spectator and would take no
part in the day's proceedings.
a number of relatives and friends
of Casemenlj, including several hand
sqfmely gowned women, also Teached
court at an early hour and were pro
vided with seats well to the front. The
stage was all set, when the principal
was led into the court. Sir J ohn Dick-,
inson, wild presided, the lawyers and
the witnesses all having taken their
' places -before?, ' Casement arrived at
10:40 o'clock and entered the dock.
v There was a hush of expectancy as he
entered, the room and every face was
turned in his direction.
The few spectators who were per
mitted to enter the famous old police
. court were V considerably surprised
when the aeond prisoner. Bailey, was
placed beside Casement in, the dock.
Bailey, a private soldier whose home
is at Wembley, a village near London,
was arrested near Trailee, Ireland, on
April 12. v He was jointly charged with
Casement with high treason but his
exact connection with the Sinn Fein
era has spot, so far, been made public.
" In the formal charge. Casement is de
scribed as of no occupation and no
fixed abode. The charge against both
defendants reads: . '
"For that they did between , the first
day of November, 1914, -and on divers
other occasions between that day and
the 21st of April, 191, unlawfully, ma
' liciously and traitorously commit high
treason within and without the realm
of England in contempt, of our sover
elgn lord and king and his laws, to
1 the evil example of others in like case
1 and contrary td the duty and alle
'giance of the defendants." -
Casement is alleged to have made a,
long statement to the authorities and
jit is believedthat this statement will
considerably - shorten the hearing be
fore the magistrate; The police court
hearing is merely a preliminary to the
' real trial which will take place later
-before a panel of the Judges of the
high court of justice.
Attorney General Sir Frederick E.
' Smith, A. li. Bodkin and Travers
Humphreys appeared for the prosecu
tion, and--. H. ' Morgan and Artemus
Ward for the defendants. .
"Sir John Dickinson presided. Short
' Jy after the magistrate had taken his
seat Casement and his fellow -prisoners
were shown into the dock. . Case
ment's appearance was vastly differ
ent from that of the man who gained
fame, by his exposure of the cruelties-
practiced on natives in Putumayo by
a. British rubber company. He sat in.
the dock, resting his chin on his hand
and occasionally looking towards the
magistrate. , '
When ; the attorney general, in open
ing the case for the prosecution, men
tioned the conferring of the order of
'knigthood on Casement, the prisoner
dropped his head. The attorney gery
eral then outlined the prisoner's ca--jeer.
- - . ' . -
In opening the case for the Crown '
the attorney-general charged that :
- Casement had conducted a systematic
campaign among the Irish prisoners J
in Germany with the purpose of se
ducing them from their , allegiance.
Bailey, he said., had been seduced in
this manner and had made a state
ment explaining Casement's actions
; in detail. According to the attorney
general. Bailey was born in Dublin
and joined the Royal Irish Rifles in
1904. ' He served with his regiment in
India and was honorably discharged.
On the outbreak of the European war
Bailey was called out as a reservist
and sailed with the original expedi
tionary force to France. - He was
taken prisoner in September, 914.
The ' attorney-general said' that
Bailey had detailed how a large num,
ber of Irish prisoners bad been, col
lected from, various prisons in ; Ger
many and placed in a large camp at
IJmburg. Here they heard addresses
by Csement, who tried to inflame their
minds against the British government
and persuade them to break their
oaths of allegiance and support him
6n his projected expedition to Ireland.

quest by counsel for the1 defense to

tation for honesty, standing and
character excellent. Mr. Taft related
how his father and George W. Riggs,
founder of the bank, were classmates
at Yale. . .
"Have you carried an account in
the Riggs riank?" asked Mr. Stanch
field. "Such as I had," was the an
swer.

tinued, with a broad smile that made

PAPP'S WIFE IN
CELL DURING HIS
FUNERAL SERVICE
Police Fearine Trouble at
Obsequies Decline to Take
' Her to Church
Fear that a disturbance might be
created at the funeral Of Nicholas
Papp, the young Canadian, who was
shot to death by his wife, Mary,
Thursday, in the factory of the
Bridgeport Metal Goods Co., if the
wishes of the wife to attend were
granted todays resulted in; the young
wife being kept in the county jail.

ered seriously by the- Jail authorities,
the coroner and police officials, none

responsibility.

Sheriff Pease that. she was held upon
a City court commitment. At police
headquarters it was learned that rela
tives of the dead man were bitter over
the- shooting and that on the other
hand Mrs. Papp had many friends in
the Hungarian colony who upheld
her act. That a demonstration might
be made by ' either side at the grave
was feared. No order was issued, by
the city court and the funeral was
held without ' Mrs. Papp at 9:30.
o'clock from the house in Spruce
street and at 10 o'clock from St,
Stephen's Hungarian Catholic church.

Mr. Papp. Many floral pieces were
arranged about the casket. -

with the inquest into the death of
Papp at 2 o'clock today in the crim
inal superior court room.
