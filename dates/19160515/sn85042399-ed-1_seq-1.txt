NUMBER 102
Senator Cummins
Wins Crowd of 1000
Senator Cummins of Iowa, candi
date (or the republican nomination
for president of the United States,
made a lasting impression upon the
crowd of over a thousand voters who
gathered to hear him in the Chautau
qua tabernacle last Thursday after
' noon. If the Iovan wins his hearers'
favor throughout Oregon as he did
in Ashland'he will no doubt carry the
republican primary In this state.
Hon. C. B. Lamkln of Ashland, an
old-time personal friend of Senator
Cummins, introduced his brother
Iowan in a happy manner which
brought the speaker into Immediate
personal touch with his audience.
Senator Cummins introduced his
remarks with the statement that Mr.
Lamkln was a live and valuable citi
zen when back in Iowa and that no
doubt Ashland had found hlra to be a
valuable citizen as well.
The presidential candidate launch
ed into an Illuminative delineation
and criticism of the Mexican policy
of President Wilson and the present
administration. Especially did he
condemn the attitude which the ad
ministration had assumed toward the
various bandit chiefs of Mexico. He
(old how the United States govern
ment had furnished Villa with arms
and favor and how later when Villa
was outlawed, had suffered our sol
dier boys to be shot down with the
same arms which the government had
given him. His predominant criti
cism was that the United States
should have recognized any of the
Mexican chiefs, Huerta, Villa or Car
ranza. Senator Cummins held that
the United States should either have
quelled the rebellion in Mexico en
tirely and without favor to any of the
belligerents, or should have carefully
kept hands off altogether. "It is the
vacillating policy of the Wilson ad
ministration which rasps upon the
patriotism of the people."
The Iowan told of the Vera Cruz
fiasco, how for a rebellious act by a
minor Mexican officer the United
States had demanded reparation, had
demanded a salute to the American
flag, how the controversy had finally
settled Into a wrangle over whether
the Mexicans shr uld fire a salute of
twenty-one guns to be answered by
an American salute or should fire
each gun In alternation. "And this
cost the lives of a number of our sol
dier boys and the cost of the occu
pancy of Vera Cruz, and, mind you,
finally the United States soldiers
were withdrawn without the salute
being fired."
Senator Cummins Is an advocate
of preparedness, not merely of guns
and soldiers but what he summed up
as "preparedness of spirit." "And
this preparedness must and can only
come through a just government."
"America should be prepared not
alone for the awful trials of war but
for the greater trials of peace as
well. Should be equipped with pa
triotism which is not merely a passion
but a deep predominating love for
and faith in our country which must
be built up from a fundamental be
ginning with the betterment of the
Industrial, economic and social condi
tions of the country. Then the Amer
ican flag will stand as an emblem of
a country of right and justice uphold
ing the Ideals upon which the country
was founded. Then the people of the
United States will have the spirit of
preparedness which will make us one
big unit in fighting the foreign foe
and overcoming the problems of
peace." '
The senator was followed by J. V.
Sam mis of Iowa, a past grand exalted
ruler of the Elks and one of the best
known Elks In the country. Mr.
Sammls outlined Mr. Cummins' politi
cal life and accomplishments and i
made a strong plea for the nomina
tion of "a man who stands as prince
advocate of justice and right."
Senator Cummins' career is that
of a typical American. He spent his
boyhood, school and college days In
western Pennsylvania; worked as
carpenter, expressman, surveyor,
railroad engineer and was Iowa's
leading lawyer for many years. A
member of the Iowa legislature, sev
en years as governor of Iowa and
elected twice to the United States
senate from Iowa. He has made a
brilliant record In the upper branch
of congress as a staunch defender
of the rights and liberties of the
worklngtnen and common 'people; for
competition as against monopoly, for
political ' freedom and : equality,
against discriminations 'and special
favors, and for a liberal 'construction
of the constitution.1 : ; ;.

If you Have Not
Lived Here Always
In order to organize the former
residents of the various states from
which they came, there are to be a
number of meetings of these resi
dents In the city hall during this and
next week, to perfect plans for an
outing which will be held in Llthla
Park during the summer. The suc
cess of these outings depends alto
gether upon the Interest that our cit
izens take, and all are urgently re
quested to be at the meeting of the
state In which they were formes resi
dents. Some states have regular or
ganizations, while some have now
under consideration the formation of
such, while other states have fewer
former residents here and it has been
deemed advisable to group the vari
ous sections, whereby there will be
a greater chance of a successful out
ing. The former residents of the Rocky
Mountain states, which include North
and South Dakota, Colorado, Ne
vada, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Ari
zona and New Mexico, will have a
meeting on Tuesday, the 16th, at 2
p. m. The former residents of Wash
ington and Idaho will meet on Wed
nesday, the 17th, at 2 p. m.; of Mich
igan, Wisconsin and Minnesota on
Thursday, the 18th, at 2 p. m.; of Illi
nois and Indiana on Friday, the 19th,
at 2 p. m.; Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and New York on Saturday, the 20th,
at 2 p. m.; the New England states
on Monday, the 22nd, at 2 p. m., and
the southern states, which include
Florida, North and South Carolina,
Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia,
Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Ten
nessee, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri
Louisiana artd Arkansas, will meet
on Tuesday, the 23rd, at 2 p. m. A
good deal of interest has been shown
by the former residents from Dixie,
and it bids well that the "Southern
StateB Day" will bo one of the big
events of the summer season.
May Pageant of
Schools Beautiful
Two thousand spectators gathered
In Chautauqua Park Saturday after
noon, coming from every part of the
valley, and witnessed the beautiful
pageant put on by the school children
of Ashland under the direction of
Miss Moffltt. The dainty little chil
dren, the graceful young ladles of the
high school, the appropriate setting
of green grass, towering trees and
the nearby creek, together formed a
picture which will remain long in the
memories of those who saw it. The
children of the grades put on several
gameB and dances. Miss Dorothy Ed
wards was most graceful in a solo
dance, "The Spirit of Spring." Folk
dances in costume by the high school
girls and the beautiful May pole spec
tacle made up a program of delight
ful beauty. Much credit was reflect
ed upon the directress by the pre
cision and beauty of the various fea
tures.
Break Ground
For First Unit
Ground has been broken for the
first unit of the Lcs Angeles Amuse
ment Company's structure opposite
Lithia Park on Pari: avenue. The
first unit of the building and the one
upon wh'ch construction is now under
way will be forty-eight by fifty feet.
The land upon which the structure
will be erected is a portion of the cor
ner tract which was bought by the
Los Angeles people from R. W. Leon
ard. The whole tract includes the
land from the Smith property on Park
avenue to the corner and extends
from Granite street to Park avenue
Lithia Will Be Off
Two or Three Days
The lithia water will be turned off
In the park and depot fountains
Wednesday of this week for two or
three days. The water will positively
be on again before Sunday. The pur
pose of the action Is to allow of the
placing of a new cylinder In the pump
so as to get a more perfect pressure.
In the past the pressure hag varied
slightly, throwing a strain, on the
lines and affecting the carbonization
of the water to some extent. .The
new. cylinder Willi, : assure a steady
pressure and even carbonization at

Litbia Park Will Be Scene of
Many Immense' Summer Outings
There will be many outings this
8iimnier of citizens of southern Oro
gou in .Lithia Park. This being the
first year of its completion, every ef
fort is being made to have these large
gatherings, to Impress our own citi
zens and the other residents of this
state of the beauties of this spot and
bring them to a realization as to the
future Ashland has before her as a
resort city.
Arrangements are being made for
outings of the men in various lines of
business, and there will be special
days, where the churches of the city
will get their members to enjoy the
beauties of the park. All of the
lodges have been asked to co-operate
and the Elks have appointed a com
mittee to make arrangements for
"Elks' Day," which, like the "Odd
Fellows' Day" on Thursday, Septem
ber 7, will tax the grounds devoted
to picnic purposes to capacity.
The former residents of other
states have been asked to have their
state days. Some of these states, like
Ohio, Kansas and Iowa, have a regu
lar organization, while others are be
ing organized. The southern states
are being grouped together for a
"Southern States' Day," as will the
New England states, Rocky Mountain
states and some of the middle west
ern states.
There will be band concerts on
Sunday afternoon and on some of the
evenings during the week, and Rose
Bros, will give Victrola concerts at
various times during the season.
During the month of June the
Scandinavians will give their Mid
summer Fest on the 24th; the Odd
Fellows will have their memorial
services on Sunday afternoon, the
11th, as will the Elks have their Flag
Day services on the same afternoon.
The Business Men's Associat'on will
probably have a big outing on the
14th, which is the National Flag Day.
The Woman's Benefit Association of
the Maccabees will have a convention
on the 21st and 22nd, and during that
week, on one of the band concert

At Vining Theatre
Two programs of pictures are listed
for Monday and Tuesday evenings
which should be welcomed by the
picture fans of Ashland.
Monday.
The Monday evening attraction
will introduce the Metro pictures,
the new company's great line of fea
tures which have been advertised in
the Tidings, to the Ashland public.
The first Metro presents Emily Stev
ens in ' Destiny; or, The Soul of
a Woman." This picture is an un-
usual dramatic masterpiece. Man-
ager Bergner of the Vining has re
ceived private advices from Portland
stating that the picture is one of the
greatest offerings ever thrown on the
screen.
Tuesday.
Mary Pickford, the sweetheart of
America, comes to the Vining screen
Tuesday evening In "The Foundling,"
a five-reel Paramount production
produced by the Famous Players
Company. The story of the play com
bines a superb blending of the pa
thetic with the comic and gives Miss
Pickford unrivalled opportunity to
exercise her ability in the role of the
abused foundling.
As "The Foundling" Mary Pickford
adds another personal triumph to her
unending list of successes.

Soda Lithia Is
Successfully In
The soda lithia water was success
fully brought Into the park Sunday,
sparkling and full of gas. A few
adjustments are being made and the
soda water will be flowing steadily
In the park within a few days. The
soda well has given more trouble
than any of the other waters, and
the successful consummation of the
work on1 the well Is a source of much
gratification to the public genewlly.

evenings, the Pacific Coast Associa
tion of Nurserymen, which has its
convention In Medford, will come
here for a drive over our scenic roads
and a picnic supper In the park.
July will be a busy month In Ash
land, the 4th, 5,th and Cth be'ng the
dates for the Springs Dedication cele
bration, and the Chautauqua begins
on the 7th and continues for ten days
or more. In August we will have an
opportunity to show tho Stato Edi
torial Association, which meets at
Medford, our developments along the
health resort lino, and In September
the (1. A. R. have a reunion, which
will be held In the park. The Odd
Fellows have already selected their
date for their outing In this month,
and they with the F.cbekahs will have
an attendance of some five hundred.
During the summer there will be a
Portland Day, as we have assurances
that the Portland Chamber of Com
merce will send a trainlond of boost
ers from that city. Tho Medford
Comnierc'nl Club have appointed a
committee to arrange for tho Medford
Day outing, which will bring residents
of our sister city here In a body. The
bankers of southern Oregon are to be
here, but, like many other events, the
date has not as yet been selected.
Of course. In addition to the gath
erings of city and valley and state
wide scope there will be scores of
smaller picnics and affairs, and dur
ing the summer Lithia Park promises
to take on the perpetual appearance
of a vast picnic grounds as family
and neighborhood picnics by the doz
en will be dally occurrences. During
the past year the habit of taking a
luncheon to the park during the
warm v eather proved to be most pop
ular, and should grow In favor this
year until a week gone by without
at least one park picnic will seem a
week lost to the Ashlander.
But it is upon the large gatherings
that Interest Is centered, and Ashland
Is assured of at least thirty big days
which will attract thousands to the
park.?,,
Puts Quietus on
Local Rumors
A decision handed down by tho su
preme court of Oregon refunded a
road tax which Ashland property
owners had paid into tho county
funds in 1912. This decision was
handed down last year and at the
time the Bullock Mercantile Company
of Medford made an effort to take
up the collection for certain Ashlnnd
ers. County Clerk Gardner heard of
the matter and published statements
In the Ashland papers calling atten-
tIon t0 tne fact tD&t the county would
refund the tax and that it was not
necessary to pay a percentage to the
collection agency. Most of the Ash
land property owners sent In their
tax receipts and got their refund, but
a few are still waiting for the owner
to call or Bend for them, when they
will be paid.
Rumors are said to bo in circulation
here to the effect that County Clork
Gardner connived in the effort of the
Medford agency to collect a percent
age. The above facts prove that this
was not true and that Mr. Gardner In
reality protected the Ashland prop
erty owners against tho company.
Leaves Rooze in
Smashed Auto
Chief of Police Porter Issued a
warrant this morning for Cliff Rob
erts of Medford, who will be brought
to Ashland by Officer Wimer to an
swer to a charge of bringing liquor
into the state. Roberts ran into tho
curb with his big automobile while
coming Into the city from Ilornbrook
Friday morning and smashed the
front wheels. The accident occurrod
near the Granite City hosuital. Rob
erts bad the car dragged to near
Loomls's store on the Boulevard,
where he left It. Chief Porter found
a bottle of whiskey In the car and
other bottles which had been thrown
out and broken at the point where
the accident occurred.
This Is the first arrest for bringing
liquor into the state by automobile,
and will be watched with Interest.
As we figure it out, the twilight
tone is that brief period lying be
tween the last note of protest and the
next atrocltf
Great Road Show
Comes Wednesday
A road show, not a motion picture,
but a comedy-drama which has cre
ated the sensation of the season on
tho coast, Is coming to Ashland on
Wednesday evening, May 17. May
Robson, regarded as tho leading com
edienne of the American stage, and a
fine cast In "The Making Over of
Mrs. Matt," Is an attraction which
guarantees an evening of complete
enjoyment.
Mrs. Herman Mattern of Ashlnnd
saw May Robson in this play In San
Francisco recently and told Manager
Bergner of the Vining that "it was
the finest comedy-drama I have ever
seen In my life."
Everywhere along the coast where
this piny has showed, the newspaper
reports are most highly commenda
tory. Of course, the art of Miss Robson,
mellowed by years of experience, Is
at its best now, picturesqueness,
feeling and charm being her chief vir
tues In the rendition of hor role, and
we can only say that Miss Robson
promises a delightful comedy that
will be found a refreshing treat both
to her auditors and her critics. She,
herself, asserting that there will be
continued waves of laughter and
storms of mirth surging from Its be
holders, for tho entire play is said to
fairly scintillate with witticism, and
Miss Robson's mannerisms and con
ception of true comedy will add much
to the amusement of her auditors.

Abbott Wins Half
At Track Meet
Lelth Abbott, representing Ashlnnd
high school at the state Interscholas
tic meet at Eugene Saturday, won the
half-mile run In the very good time
of two minutes, four and two-fifths
Bcconds. Abbott won the race by a
good margin and could probably have
bettered his time had he been pushed
hard. The five points won by Abbott
plnced Ashlnnd eighth In the list of
the thirty-one schools entered. The
other Ashlnnd entries did not place.
Williamson of Medford won third
plaeo in tho pole vault and hurdles

The Law in Regard
To Registration
Prior to the recent amendment ot
Section 2, Article II, of the Oregon
Constitution, which requires all per
sons to be citizens of the United
States before they can vote, a person,
foreign born, could vote on his first
papers, but since the enactment of
sa'd section such person must bo a
citizen to have the right of suffrage,
which means that he shall have com
plied with the naturalization laws
and received his final papers.
The permanent registration law of
1915 provides that a foreign person
reg'sterlng shall state: "Whether
naturalized, If naturalized, the time,
place and court of naturalization, aa
evidenced by the final citizenship pa
pers or a duly authenticated copy of
certificate thereof, made by the
proper officer of the court where is
sued and exhibited by the elector."
A provision Is made that a. person
heretofore registered as fully natural
ized shay not lie required to exhibit
his citizenship papers when register
ing under said art, which could apply
only as shown by the records of pre
vious registrations, and as there
wore no distinctions made aa to
declarations or first papers and nat
uralization or second papers, it Is
necessary to have tho final papers
exhibited now In order to comply
with tho law.
In referring to the registration of
foreign born persons, the attorney
general In an opinion recently said:
"As applied to the registration of
such citizens, clearly he cannot fur
nish the final citizenship papers fof
the Inspection of the county clerk as
provided In Section 3 of Chapter 225.
Laws of 1915, and. In the absonce of
any showing In the former registra
tion books of the county whether an
elector there registered was natural
ized or not, It Is apparent that ha
cannot comply with either of tho
qualifications and that It will he nec
essary for him to comply with tho
naturalization law."
In cases where the records of for
mer registrations have shown the
person fully naturalized his registra
tion has been accepted without the
exhibit of papers.
When the present registration Is
completed the records will show
everyone registered as "fully natural
ized," und It will not be necessary
for persons re-reglsterlng to exhibit
their papers.
The registration law hns boon ad
ministered In the other counties of
Oregon as in Jackson county, exhibit
of Papers or exact dates being
quired.
Having helped to draft the regis
tration law, will say that the law aa
first drawn required only evldenrn
for proof of naturalization law, the
requirements for the exhibit of pa
pers being tacked on by the legisla
ture. Considerable has been said by the
Mail Tribune as to the registration
of certain persons, among them be
ing Mrs. Bellinger of Medford, whose
card was returned for correction
only; Mr. Budge, Mr. Ashpole and
Bert Hnney, all of whom have been
registered as well as some of the
othors mentioned by the Mall Trl-
bane.
A special effort has been made to
get In touch with the records of thoso
affected, many being able to find a
record of their citizenship papers,
while others find they are not citi
zens, but have been voting on either
their own or their father's first pa
pers, which was proper up to this
year.
As to Mr. Ahorn's ense: Mr.
Ahren said: "Mr, Putnam had the
law there and said I could he regis
tered, and that It was not necessary
for mo to exhibit any papers." I am
not aware as to what part Mr. Put
nam hns In tho registration, outside
of his liberal criticism, of which I
havo no objections were It all the
truth.
As to Mr. Kelly's opinion In the
mntter, will say that I have followed
his advleo when his advice has been
asked. G. A. GARDNER.
