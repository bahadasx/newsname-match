Modify Dublin Regulations
DUBLOT. May 14. Great modifi
cation in the regulations of martial
law gave the people greater freedom.
All may now come and go as they
.visit hctweeu the hours of I in the
morning and midnight. I Hiring the
remaining four hour they must keep
within doors.
.It is generally uiuh rafood that
Premier Asguith is responsible for
this relaxation. The premiers study
of conditions and the sentiments of
the people apparently convinced him
that there was no element of rebel
lious spirit remaining.
Mr. Asiulth"s chief occupation
sines his arrival in Dublin has cori
isted in seeking a method for the
adjustment of :h Irish crisis rand
ascertaining whether It would be d
i isable to return to the former sys
tem of government or adopt a change
or rule more in accordance with the
'.' shes of the people. The premier
has also given some attention to
minor factors, those having to do
with the dtopanl of the remaining
rebel prisoners and comen-al ion
for the materia! damage done in
Dublin.
Neither of these question ha yet
been solved, but Mr. Au,uith had an
opportunity to see and question a
n .mber of rebels in the detention
barracks and today again visited the
ruin, of the buildings destroyed in
various sections of the city.
The view widely prevails thu .Mr.
Astjulth on his return to London will
propose to Incorporate the nationalist
and unionist fones of armed volun
teer into the auxiliary troops of the
imiierial armv ami thus moid the
admittedly perilous problem of di--armlng
everybody in Ireland not be
longing to the recognized military
organisations. At the same time, the
opinion crows apace in CgVOT of a
real Irish executive council, formed
of Irishmen, entirely eonversani with
the people and their aspiration and
