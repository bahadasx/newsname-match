Wilson to Prepare Vigorous
Note for Dispatch to John
Bull, Who Has Been Con
fiscating American Mail
Washington, May 16. President
Wilson is preparing a very vigorous
message to Great Britain with re
gard to the selzue of United State
mail. The state department 1 col
lectlng a mass of figures showing how
far the British have gone in their
selxures.. Secretary Lansing declared
that the entire subject of confiscated
malls was "under consideration."
This was interpreted to mean that
he plans a new protest.
The last step in the negotiations
was the British memorandum indi
cating a willingness on the part of
his majesty's government to concede
some points at issue. Apparently
this did not go far enough. It was
expected that the administration
would be insistent upon entire free
dom for the passage of American
mall.

President Wilson, impatient at tha
continued holding up of malls, was
"going to the mat with England"
about It Probably the note will be
completed eoon.

protests from business men of Amer
ica and business men abroad with re
gard to Inconveniences resulting from
mail delays. The state department
has already protested once, but the
reply was unsatisfactory.
