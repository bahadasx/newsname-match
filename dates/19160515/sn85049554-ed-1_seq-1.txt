London, May M.—Sir Roger Case
ment, who .only a few years ago
achieved international fame Cor the
services he rendered his government
in the exposure of the Putumayo rub
ber atrocities, today fseed the bar In
an ordinary police 4ourt for a prelim
inary examination. to determine wheth
er he should be held for trial on a
charge of high treason against the
same government in connection with
the rebellion in Ireland. Beside Case
ment ®tood Daniel Julian Bailey, who
faced a similar charge.
Not in many years has so much pop
ular intesast been manifested in a case
before the court. This Is not due only
to -the prominence of 'Casement, but
also because It la expected evidence
will be presented. which will lay bare
a wide plot in Ireland.
Restriot Admission to Court.
Admission to the court room was
restricted to about 100 persons, include
Ing representatives-of the press.
Among the earliest arrivals In the
court was Sir Horace Plunkett, of the
department of, agriculture in Ireland.
He took a seat near the magistrate. It
was understood Sir Horace, was mere
ly a spectator. A number of relatives
and friends, of- .Casement, including
Allies, and Greaoa in Agreement.

Casemanfa Suocesa Waa Small:'
In his story of the remitter in which
Casement' set about raising an Irish
brigade
among
prisoners in Germany, to
fight against England, the attorney
general
said
the prisoner had met with
•little success. Such men as he won
over wefre set free, provided with green
Uniforms and received rewards.
When the attorney general declared
that one of the Irish prisoners had
Struck CasemeiVt In the face on being
asked to join the "brigade. Casement
smiled disdainfully. Bailey was one of
the prisoners seduced by Casement,
the attorney general said, and was
made an officer of the brigade.
The attorney general said Casement'
was found concealed In what is known
locally as 'iMcKinna's fort." He gave
the name of Richard Morton, of Buck
inghamshire and Tils occupation as an
author. He was seen to drop a paper
which contained a code, including the
following:
"Await further instruction. Have de
cided- to stay. Further ammunition
and rifles needed. Send another ship."
Driven .From Umburg Camp.
According to testimony given this
afternoon, by Daniel O'Brien, an Irish
prisoner^ who Was at Ltmburg during
a visit by Casement there, and who
afterwards was exchanged, Casement
was hissed and booted out of the lilm
burg. camp. Some members of a
Munster regiment struck Sir Roger
and several prisoners. Including
O'Brien, were punished for It, the
witness said, their rations being cut
down.
The attorney general said Casement
described himself as the Trgjtnlzer of
the Irish volunteers and Impressed on
the Irish prisoners in Germany that
all was to be gained for Ireland by
Germany winning the war. Those
Who Joined the brigade he was at
tempting to form were promised by
Casement, the attorney general said,
that they would be sent to Berlin as
guests of the qterman government.
Caaamant Rfeovtrs Composure.
Wh*ri Sir Roger took his place in
the dock for the afternoon session It
was plain his nervousness had largely
worn off. The Casement of old, whos?
self esteem was a marked feature, was
reasserting himself. His spirits were

WATERLOO STUDENT

Lavarn Chapman L. Lift In Attempt

Special to Times^RepubllqaJ™.
Inwa Clty, May 15.—"Gtood byw. twya,
I won't' see you a^Wn!" laughingly
called
Greek letter bfttthwrs at the fliflmw| Chl'
fraternity chapter house, Sunday attpr-..
noon, at 2 o'olock.
Less than two hours later, his life
less" body lay in 'the Iowa river sub
merged In twenty-five feet of water,
below the Coralvilfe dam.
He was drowned* when his canoe, in
which he and a companion were shoot
ing the rapids just below the dam, waa
upset In the terrific waves.
Chapman is a freshman in the college
of liberal arts, and Is aged about 10. He
Is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Frank W.
Chapman, a leading contractor of Wat
erloo.
'His college mate in the fatal outing
was Orton A. (Klrschman, of Mason
City, a junior law student aged about
21.
Both were unusually good swimmers,
and as daring as they were skilled.
They were rowing on the river, an
hour or so, and went to the dam be
tween 3 and 4 o'clock. After one suc
cessful "shooting of the rapids" they
essayed a second thrilling flight over
the wild waves.
Chapman, occupying the rear seat of
the boat leaped into the frail craft, at
the west shore of the Iowa, as he
shoved off the canoe with Klrschman in
the other end. The shock of entrance
and the force of the waves turned the
boat over and flung both young men
out
Klrschman was hurled free, but
Chapman clung to the craft.
Klrshman swam ashore, supposing
Chapman" was following him, as ther
younger student seemed to be working
slyoreward wtlh the boat as Klrschman
glanced backward as he fought his way
to the bank tbru the fierce waves, be
neath which dragged a powerful under
tow.
Both men had been swept mldstream
ward and downward, but Chapman waa
evidently driven back to the dam.
When Klrachman, safely landed on the
shore, looked again, Chapman had been
hurled against the dam, fifty feet from
the short, and was fighting desperately.
Klrschman rushed to the water's edge
and prepared to leap in to swim to the
doomed man's rescue, but before he
could leap th£ other sank from sight
and the canoe was flung out on the
waves, cut In two.
Seemingly the tiny craft hart been
smashed against the rocks or the dam
proper and shattered, the jar tearing
the boat from Chapman's grasp—if he
were not rendered unconscious by a
blow on the head when he met a rock
or the dam, himself.
A search for the body was immedi
ately instituted, hundreds of people go
ing up the river with boat lines, hooks,
etc. The Sigma Chi brothers of the
drowned young man secured a monster
sand boat from a working crew down
the river, as a small boat of the ordi
nary type had no chance to buffet the
waves near the dam.
No sign of-Chapman has been seen,
however. It li probable the body had
been sucked ofcder the d%m. yasaHMKy.
