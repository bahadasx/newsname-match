"Will the progressive party

Here is Gardner*, reply:
By Gilson Gardner.
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 15.
— The progressives, in my judg
ment, cannot and will not support
Hughes for the presidential nom
ination!
The progressive delegates In
convention nt Chicago will have
no second choice. They are for
Roosevelt, nnd will be for Roose
velt as first, second and ever:
other choice, unless Roosevelt
v\ ithdraws his name and refuses
to run.
In that case the convention in
all human probability would
name a progressive like Hiram
Johnson, Victor Mttrdock, Henry
J. Allen or Clifford Pinchot, to
cast at le-ist a conscience vote.
'I lie progressive conven
tion will not, In my Judg
ment, endorse or noniliiute

OPERATION WORKS
WONDERS FOR TWO
ABNORMAL BRAINS
NEW YORK, May 15.-—Brain
socialism!
Is the time at hand when all
humanity's mental wealth is go
ing to be equalized, by drawing
off tho superlative mentality of
highly stimulated brains, and in
fusing It Into the defectives, the
subnormal and the backward
children, hitherto a menace to so
ciety?
These are the amazing possi
bilities opened up by an epoch
making operation performed at
St. Mary's hospital, In Brooklyn.
Side by side on two operating
tables lay a highly strung, men
tally over-active woman of a well
to-do family, and a backward
child of six years. ■
Skillful surgeons removed part
of the enlarged thyroid gland,
which had produced a goiter on
the woman's throat, and trans
planted it to the boy's throat.
The operation was over In half an
hour.
Within a few days the woman's
former neurotic tendencies were
notably diminished, while the
boy at the end of 15 days had de
"The Unafraid"
• Delight Warren. American heiress, in "The
Unafraid" girl, whose adventures in Monteneg
ro are told hy Eleanor Ingrain in the novel-a
week, which hegins in The Times today on page
2.
Against the wishes of her relatives, Delight
had consented to he the bride of a handsome
nobleman of Montenegro. The bridegroom
breaks a leg, and the marriage, which was to
take place in Paris, is postponed. •
She goes to Montenegro to meet him. She's
then captured by his brother, the count, and is
forced to marry him instead.
The count, however, is a true man of honor.
What caused him, then, to adopt such unseemly
tactics with Delight!
Brgiu "The Unafraid" today. The novel ends
Saturday.
His position on Americanism aim
preparedness is absolutely un
known. No progressive, nor any
progressive convention, nor Theo
dore Roosevelt will endorse a
man whose position on these ex
tremely important issues Is left
to Inference or guesswork.
Even should there be un elev
enth-hour declaration by Hushes
or by some friend of Hughes to
clear up his position on these
subjects, It Is doubtful whether
it would be sufficiently convinc
ing.
Progressive leaders like George
W. Perkins do not wish to an
tagonize the friends of Hughes,
or any of the influential men who
are to determine the doings of
the republican convention.
They do not criticize Hughes,
or say at this time that they
would not support Hughes. It is
hoped, If Roosevelt Is nominated,
that Roosevelt will get the
Hughes support.
As n matter of fact, however,
there Is no Idea in the mind of
George W. Perkins or any of hla
associates that Roosevelt can or
will be set aside and Hughes sub
stituted as a second choice. If
Perkins had such an idea he
could not put it over.
The thousand delegates who
will come to the progressive con
vention, will come as Roosevelt
men first, but they will be pro
gressive party men second, and It
may be predicted here that tlie
progressive party will be contin
ued as a party nationally and to
a certain extent locally ami if
Roosevelt Is not the nominee of
both parties and will not take the
nomination of the progressive
parly alone -this Is to lie derid
ed at the time the conventions
are held and to be determined by
the choice of the republicans -

in th.f I'nlted Stales may be the
•nicer outcome of Seattle's fight
against drug store's "blind pig"
Mayor Hiram C. Gill has an
nounced that he propotes to do
just that If no legal obstacles pre
vent.
Brazenly defiant of the prohi
bition luw enacted with the new
year, many oealtle druggists have
done a bar business behind the
thlnnesl possible cloak ol secrecy.
Word came to Mayor Gill and
Prosecuting Attorney Lundin that
several of the more notorious vio
lators had deliberately planned lo
sell booze and had sel aside a
certain sum to be paid^as fines
whenever they were apprehended.
One of these "prescription spe
cialists is repotted to have mude

That is about the only contin

counted on, and they are amazed
at the supreme daring of the
plan.
The prominent "dry*" are with
holding comment, but it is under
stood that they have been con
vinced that this is prnctlcally the.
only way in which drug store
"blind pigging" can be checked.

Hill, son-in-law of James J. Hill,
the railroad magnate, today upon

peace will come as suddenly as
the war broke out.
"The French are eating only
sufficient food to sustain their
health. King Albert is confident
