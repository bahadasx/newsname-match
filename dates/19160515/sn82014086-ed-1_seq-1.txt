ant developments in the Investigation

the same kind that Is alleged to have

drews, with whose murder Mrs. Archer-Gill
igun is specifically charged. -.
The police would not comment on a
widespread dumor that Mr. Gilligan's
body had been ordered eihumeo and
an autopsy performed. Neither would
they discuss rumors that a number of
bodies would be exhumed in Connecti
cut cemeteries.
Tho state police had another active
day today In their search for addi
tional evidence to support their claim
that a number of persons at the home
had mef with violent death.

for Mrs. Archer-Gilligan had engaged
detectives to work on the case and
that the detectives were working all
day in Windsor.

committee of prominent churchmen
have been written to 10,000 clergy
men throughout the country, it . was
announced tonight, asking them to
embody in their sermons next Sunday

It is admitted that "there is no rea
sonable ground to hope that the na
tions of the world will at this staee
go so far as to disarm and create an
international army and navy to police
the world." -
'However," the letter says, "we have
got to the point where there is ground
for hope that at the end of this war
the community of nations will do what
every primitinve community sooner or
later does namely, unite in forming a
vigilance committee in which. - they
agree to use their combined force to
see that outlawry is kept down and
the peace maintained.".
The letter adds:
"Shall we not say that If nations
m,ust arm, the 'armaments shall be
used to support law rather than to
break it?

Dublin. May 14. The great raodlfi- I
cation in ' the : regulations of martial
law gave the people of Dublin today
rreedom of movement, strongly con
trasting with the restrictions imposed
since the rebellion. Ail may now coma
and - go- as they wish between the
hours of 4 In the morning and mid
night. During' the remaining four
hours they must keep within doors.
It is generally understood that Pre
mier Asquith is responsible for this
relaxation. The premiers study of
conditions and the sentiments of the
people apparently convinced him that
there was no great element of rebel
lious spirit remaining. . .
What Asquith Is Doing.
Mr. Asa tilth's chief occupation since
his arrival in Dublin has consisted in
seeking a method for the adjustment
of the Irish crisis and in ascertaining
whether it would be advisable to re
turn to the former system of govern
ment or to adopt a change of rule
more in accordance with the wishes of
the people. The premier has also
given some attention to minor factors,
these having to do with the disposal
of the remaining rebel prisoners and
compensation for the material dam
age done In Dublin.
Neither of these questions has yet
been solved, but Mr. Asquith had an
opportunity to see and question a
number of rebels in the detention bar
racks and today again visited the ruins,
of the buildings destroyed In various
sections of the city. The Information
he thus obtained may be of great ser
vice to him when the subject is
brought before the cabinet on his re
turn to London, which is expected at
an early date.
Future Government.
Nationalist and "Unionist circles are
animatedly discussing tentative -sug
gestions respecting tha future govern
ment of the country, with hope, , but
without certainty, that a change for
the better will be brought about. Mr.
Asquith's, present here has lent color
to the belief that the. prime minister
had some project In mind and that his
study of conditions on the spot would
help hint formulate a definite plan to
place before parliament.
. Armed Volunteers.
, The view widely prevails that Mr.
Asquith will propose to Incorporate the
Nationalist and Unionist forces of
armed volunteers into the auxiliary
troops of the imperial army and thus
GREATEST STORAGE RESERVOIR
IN THE WORLD COMPLETED
To Feed Irrigation System in New
Mexico, Texas and Mexico.
Elephant Butte, N. M May 14.
Work was completed here yesterday
on the Elephant Butte dam, a United
States reclamation- service project
which, by .damming the Rio Grande
river, forms the greatest storage res
ervoir in the world. Construction be
gan five years ago. . The reservoir will
feed an irrigation system that will
water 185,000 acres of land In New
Mexico, Texas and Mexico.
The dam blocks acanyon of the Rio
Grande 120 miles north of El Paso.. It
is the fifth of the government's big
irrigation projects and will store the
entire flow and flood of the viver.
- The reservoir will bold 115,000,000,
000 cubic feet of water, which reclama
tion service experts say would cover
the state of Delaware to a depth of
two feet.
' The dam stands 318 feet high and
is 1,674 feet long. It provides a road
way across the canyon 16 feet wide and
at its base is 235 feet thick.
Territory to be Irrigated by the res
ervoir lies In four valleys. For each
of these a diversion dam and main
canals are being constructed. Twenty
five thousand acres of land Is on the
Mexico side of the river near Juarez.
More than half of It Is virgin, with a
small acreage owned by the govern
ment Thie government before' beginning
construction of the dam laid out a
town equipped with modern conven
iences, - such as electric lights, water
and sewerage, stores, schools, hospi
tals, hotels and a theatre. At times as
many as 4,000 persons lived In the
town, whose government was entirely
under the jurisdiction of the engineers.
A railway was constructed through 13
miles of rough -country to connect the
camp with a main line railroad.
