DRPET BEGINS
LEGAL BUTTLE
AGAINST DEMI
Pale and Haggard, But De
fiant, Young Student Faces
Court on Charge of Poi
soning Sweetheart.
SEEK JUHY OPPOSED
TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
Attorneys Fcr Defense Frank
ly Admit Chief Object
is to Avert Death
Sentence.
Intfiiiiti'iii.il News Service:
wacki::an. hi., .May Pale
and haggard fiom his months of
confinement, but withal defiant. Will
Orpet, University of Wisconsin stu
dent and Uta Prummel amemg his
school girl friends, wt-nt on trial for
his life today in Judge Charles Don
nelly's court hTP.
Orpet, the state charges, admin
istered the poison which caused the
death of Marian Frances Iunbert,
one of his schools day sweethearts,
as they stood in the snow in Holm's
woods last February she pleading
with him. he obdurate. Tho girl
thought she was ahout to heroine a
mother. It was from this disgrace
that she was pleading with him to
save her throutrh marriage.
Today's session and quite pr b
ahly those of the entire week was
taken up with preliminary leal
.skirmishing, and efforts to get a
Jury. In this work Orpet's attorneys
admitted they hae hut one object,
and that Is to get a jury composed
as largely as posshle of men who
oppose capital punishment.
The little court room was crowded
today. The parents of the girl, their
months of grief plainly visible in
their faces, sat on one side of the
court. On the other sat young Or
et's father and mother, scarcely
less grief-stricken, hut. hopeful.
School friends of Marian and of
youni? Orpet. many of them wit
nesses and the curious folk for
miles around made up the halance.
Sjh'IhI" Time Heading.
Orpet, since his confinement, has
spent his time reading. Hu-ie vol
umes of law hooks pertaining to
trials on circumstantial evidence
have been favorites. And, accord
ing to his jailers, he lias developed
an almost abnormal taste for loe
and his weird fanaticisms on mur
der, suicide and after life.
A little stir was created just prior
to the opening1 of the trial when it
became noised about that rpet's
attorneys have dm: up a letter, said
to have been sent by him to th:
girl. In which he said:
"Iont do anything desperate until
I arrive." This would indicate that
the girl was contemplating suicide,
and would be a strong point for the
young student, as it is on this theory
that practically the whole fabrie of
Ids defence has been contrm ted.

Horses and Dog !
Electrocuted in
Pool of Water
Sunday night's severe electrical
storm it suited in the electrocution
of two horses ami a doir, and the
Mnasii-up of a Muessel Hrewins Co.
dliery truck, besides the flooding
of numerous basements in the city.
The horses owned by the Schultz
l'.aking ' o. and irfven by Fred
idruer wre kilbd Monday morn
ni,; near the Sample st. bridge. The
drier urteil the horses into a mid'
paddle and they droppe! dead. A
do that trdted up to the scene im
mediately after the death of the an
imals lapped the water and w.is. in
stant iy killed. ...
According to (.'. I. rlmmons, gen
eral mMiager of the street railway
company, the accident was caused
b a charged wire from the Indiana
and Michigan Flectric Co. lines
hanging down into the pool ol
water. Lightning damaged some ol
the insulators in the west end ot
town, which tied, up trallic early
Monday morning, but these were re
paiied early and normal conditions
restored. The interurhan car east
at (ioshen. the general manager re
ported, was also tied up for a while
Monday morning for the same rea
son. Another theory of the cause of
the aicMent was that the death
dealing sho ks came irom the street
laiPvay n.ils, a battery box on a
nearby pole having been struck by
li'-ihtniru; and having fallen, to the
ground.
The accident to the Muessel
brewery truck occurred at Curbing;
and Ilex .st., w here a live-foot "wash
out undermined the pavement. The
brewery horses had safely crossed
but the brick and mall layer of sup
porting earth caed in when the
heavy truck partially loaded with
beer casks rolled over the spot. The
driver of the truck was uninjured
and the horses escaped. The truck,
however, was damaged, but was re
moved from the hole.
It was also reported that a fire
man was shocked by coming into
contact with a live wire on Allen st.
No confirmation of this report could
he had.
According to Weather Observer
Henry Swaim. there was a ra'nfall
Sunday night of T.o2 inches, while
the entire precipitation during the
pro. mils -4 hours was 1.4."), making
over inches of rainfall in the
last C hours. lowlands in the
country were partially inundated,
and small streams were swollen into
torrents.
Farmers who' have already been
plowing report that the damage was
slight to the worked lands, except
the loss of time they will sustain.
Some planting h.s been carried on,
but it is reported, this was in the
sandy regions ami little damage re
sulted. The St. Joseph river is now at the
highest point that it has heen this
spring but unless there is- a much
heavier fall of rain, little danger is
feared.
Iättle damage direct from the
storm was reported in .South Ilend.
Telephone service was uninter
rupted, while telegraph companies
reported no trouble locally from
broken wiies. Car service was some
what impaired Sunday night.

"You may say that the I'nited

able to cope with any situation
which may arise and you may add
that there is no danger of attack
from any source or direction. The
result of the battle a few days ago
at je Azules put such fear into the
hearts of the bandits that it will be
a long time before they will invite
another such beating."
Gen. Pershing denied categorical

such move is contemplated in the

Iiitornnti.'n.il News Service:
SAN ANTONIO. Texas. May 15
Gen. Funston will send militin forces
from here to the border as soon, as
they can be whipj ed into shape for
active service. American olheers
believe that Mexico raids will bo re
peated and are therefore anxious to
gel additional fnYces to the long
border front as soon as possible.
It is expected that the next depre
dations will occur in th'e Hrowns
ihe district, but other unprotected
points on the bonier may be made
the objects of Mexican attacks, the
bandits continuing their efforts to
arouse bitter feeling between the
two countries.
(Jen. Funston is himself directing
the equipment and training of the
state military forces concentrated
here. He is determine.! that noth

seemed intent only on overtaking

Accordingly it was Maj. I-m-

continued his investigation of fires

F INDICTMENTS
Gambling Defendants Assert
133 True Bills Are Illegal.
Challenge Juror.
Whether l'J3 indictments returned
ai the February session of the cir
cuit court grand jury against al
leged gambling house keepers, fre
quenters, liquor law violators, resort
owners and habitues, will stand, is a
matter to be determined Tuesday
morning in the superior court.
When the 10.( odd defendants
were arraigned in the -court room
Monday morning the majority tiled
ideas in abatement. The pleas at
tacked the validity ot the indict
ments, alleging that one of the
grand jurors sitting- during the ses
sion and conducting the investiga
tion which resulted in the returning
vf. the indictments, was neither a
householder nor freeholder.
Fdvvard Fack of New Carlisle is
the juror in question. It is alleged
in the abatement pleas, that service
on a neph'jw of the man whose
name was drawn from the jury box
by the jury commissioners was
made, or that the uncle of the juror
who sat in the grand jury, agreed
prior to the session, that the nephew
should take the uncle's place, as
both had the same names and that
no one would know the difference.
Ditoivc IU-eals Facts.
Information that the Pack who
sat on the grand jury was the wrong
party, was revealed on the same day
the indictments were returned
through the filing of a divorce suit
by Pack's wife. Considerable discus
sion as to wether in the event that
it was shown to be the wrong party,
as to whether this would Invalidate

International News Sendee:
WASHINGTON, May 1.". A

The resDlution was reported to he

Without debate the resolution ,
went over under the rules for future
consideration. A paragraph of the
resolution read "that pending war
among other nations, the congress,
and the people of the United States
are desirous of maintaining even
handed and undiscriminating neu
trality." ci :n sorsi i 1 1 111 :ia x i:d.
International News Service:
PIvULIN, May 15. The most
notable relaxation of the censor
thown since the war began is now
apparent in relation to peace talk
in the newspapers and in press tele
grams being sent outside of Ger
many. The general tenor of the peace
arguments is that the people of the
belligerent countries are tired of the
bloody strife and the enormous
financial drain and are ready to
quit if their governments consent.
In Germany the declaration is
constantly heard that the German
government stands ready and willing
to open peace negotiations. The con
stant reiteration of this statement,
it is believed, is having considerable
moral effect upon the peoples of the
nations at war with Germany. It
may eventually weld public opinion
so stronuly that the governments
may be forced to listen to the voice
of the public and heed it.
Wümmi Logical .Mediator.
There is now strong disposition in
some quarters to regard Pres't Wil
son as the logical mediator, al
though tris has recently been weak
ened by the refusal of the I'nited
States to heed Germany's demand
that the American government com
pel Kngland to lighten her blockade
against the German allies.
Some newspapers express the
opinion that the chance now awaits
Pres't Wilson to become one of the
great intc- rnational .figures in history
by making; representations to bring
to an end the greatest war in tho
history o mankind.
Expressions, especially from mem
bers of the Ilritish government, that
the allies will fight until Germany
is crushed into the dust, are re
garded here as the only obstacle
which prevents Pres't Wilson's from
making some sort of overtures to
the belligerent governments.
