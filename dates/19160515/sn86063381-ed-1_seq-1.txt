INDIAN TREATY
NEARLY AMENDED
BY CONGRESS
Meunie Affecting Territory Here is
Almost AmenAnd by
Senators.
LIQITOB LAW SATO*
BY NARROW MARGIN
Bill is Seat Back for Conference
Objection is Made by Senator
Olapp.
Regulations regarding the sale of
liquor in this district covered by the
Indian treaty of 1866 barely escaped
being greatly modified by the U. &
senate recently* according to word
received from Washington. But for
an objection made by Senator Moses
E. Clapp, the proposed law would
have passed the senate.
Arises During Discussion.
The question arose during a dis
cussion of the conference report on
the Indian bill.
In the section relating to the hand
ling of liquor in Indian country there
was a provision that enforced heavy
penalties against any one guilty of
introducing liquor into Indian coun
try, at the end of which appeared the
following language:
"And the possession by a person of
intoxicating liquors in the country
where the introduction is prohibited
shall be prima facile evidence of un
lawful introduction."
Provision is Amended.
The conferees amended this provi
sion by making it apply to "Indian"
country, striking out the word "the"
before "country," and substituting
the word "Indian."
Senator Clapp called attention to
this change, saying:
"The amendment that had been of
fered in the senate did not contain
the words 'Indian country' but read
'in the country where the introduc
tion is prohibited.'
"I am not fully satisfied about
putting the word "Indian' into the
bill, for I do not want any legislation
to pass here, unless congress deliber
ately seeks to"~pal's it, that will sub
ject the territory covered by the
treaty to a repeal as to the provisions
of the treaty."
Fears Proposed Change.
Senator Clapp stated further the
change might lead to an interpreta
tion that would exclude large por
tions of the territory covered by the
1855 treaty, simply because it is not
now occupied by Indians and there
fore in that sense not "Indian coun-
try."
Senator Nelson concurred in this
view.
The bill was sent back to confer
ence.

STATE GEOGRAPHICAL
NAMES AND THEIR HIS-
TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE
(Prepared by the Minne
sota'Historical Society for the
United Press.)
LAC QUI PARLE COUNTY
In 1S62 the legislature au
thorized the establishment of
a county of this name north
of the Minnesota river and its
enlargement known as Lac
qui Parle, but the inhabitants
failed to organize. The
present county was establish
ed in 1871. The Dakota
name for the lake was Moe
Iyedan which was translated
by the early French traders as
Lac qui Parle or the Lake that
Talks. The name is said to
derive its significance either
from the echoes thrown back
by the bluffs bordering the
lake or from the remarkable
creaking, groaning and whist
ling of its ice in the winter
and spring, caused by fluc
tuations in the water level.
