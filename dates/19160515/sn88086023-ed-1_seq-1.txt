LONDON, May 15. Clad in a aeedy,
frayed ault, Sir Roger Casement went
to trial today In the Bow Htreet police
court on a charge of treason. En
tering the courtroom ho smiled to ac- L
ijuulntunccs The little courtroom
waa Jammed. Daniel Bailey, a soldier,
also charged with treason, accompan
ied Casement. Prosecutor Smith rei,
the i hurge which declared that Case
ment planned the reoclllon and plot
ted to land several expeditions In Ire
land and on the British coast It
said that the Uerman auxiliary sunk
when Casement was landed carried
20,000 rifles, a million rounds of am
munition, machine guns and bombs.
An exchanged Irish prisoner testi
fied that Casement attempted to In
duce irishmen Imprisoned In Germany
to desert. He said that some had ac
cepted the overtures and enlisted n
the German army.
Casement was calm while 8mlth
read the charges His eyes roved, oc
casionally resting on the presiding
magistrate and then the spectators.
When Smith referred to Casement's
endeavors to wean Imprisoned Irish
men from the causa of the allies.
Casement smiled and wrote on a pad:
"They deserted at their own request."
Smith exhibited a flag of the Irish
republic which he said Casement
had brought ashore and burled In the
sand near TTalee During the latter
part of the session Casement squirmed
nervously. The arrest of Bailey was,
kept secret until today. His confes
sion was read. It said that after ho
left the prisoner's camp and Joined
the Germans he was ordered to ac
company Casement to Ireland. A col
lapsible boat from the submarine was
overturned In the surf and reached
the shore with difficulty. He went to
a shop at Tralee where Casement was
scheduled to meet the rebel leader,
who failed to appear. Bailey was ar
rested while entering an automobile
to attend a meeting of rebels.
This Is merely the preliminary hear
ing. The crown has reserved much

When the three hlK cars arrived

through the band and found a four or
five year old white hoy among them.
They took seven or eight pictures of
bun and then wired to Pennsylvaala
for a better description. Meanwhile
the gypsies , passed on. Yesterday
word was received from Pennsylvania
that the lost child had two crowns
to his head and a mole on the back
of his neck. Officer Harry Edwards

Move on to Secure
Rate Allowing Grain
Cleaned in Transit
EFFORT IS TO OVERCOMB INJI S
l l I to tYEBTEBH 1)1 U.FJIS
BY EASTKUN GP.IDLHS.
It has become learned In local
grain circles that a move is on to se
cure an arrangement whereby wheat
shipped east this season may be sent
via Portland and cleaned in transit at
i he docks In that city, it Is presum
ed that authority for such a rate will
have to be secured from the interstate
commerce commission
I There has been considerable com
! plaint regarding the handling of west
ern wheat shipped east last fall and
I during the winter. In the absence of
j a state standard of grading wheat the
wheat was graded and cleaned on
reaching the Atlantic ports. In the
cleaning process. It is declared a
J? grading
was often given than
i the facts called for. Wheat contain
ing nothing but dust was docked for
being smutty.
By having the wheat cleaned in
transit In Portland it Is said the deal-.
ers will have a better show in thi
east At the same time the plan would
avoid a congestion of cars at eastern
terminals as least year the wheat had
to be kept in the cars until it could
le cleaned.
What makes the problem a press
ing one is the fact present indication.?
are that all export wheat will go east !
by rail. Thus far no ships have been !
ihartered out of northwest porta and
with the pronounced scarcity of ship
it is possible all the ocean carriers
will be kept on the Atlantic. Should
suck prove the case, western people
will want a square deal in the matter
of grain grading In New York and It
is said the shipment east of cleaned
wheat will work to this end.
