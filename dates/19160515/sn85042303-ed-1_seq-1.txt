IRELAND BEGAN TODAY.

Daniel Julian Bailey, Irish Soldier, Ar
rested Yesterday, Charged with Be
ing Accessory to Sir Roger Off the
German Submarine.
London, May 15. The trial in police
court of Sir Roger Casement, who is
charged with high treason in connec
tion with the alleged landing of arms
in Ireland from a German submarine
was started today. This Is preliminary
to the court martial.
The spectators were surprised to
Bee a second defendant in the person
of Daniel Julian Bailey, the Irish sol
dier, who Is charged with being the
man accompanying Sir Roger off the
German submarine, and who was ar
rested yesterday.
When in opening for the prosecu
tion, the attorney general mentioned
the conferring of knighthood on Case
ment, the prisoner dropped his head.
The attorney general said Casement
visited Irish prisoners in Germany and
told them" that It would be best for
Ireland if Germany won the war. He
attempted to form a brigade of those
prisoners and told them that if Ger
many won a seat battle, they would
be sent back to Ireland. If Germany
did not win, they would be given free
passage to America and $ 100 each. He
added that of the four thousand Irish
addressed by Casement, only fifty
joined the 'brigade.
A dramatic touch was given to the
trial when the attorney general dis
played the rebels' green flag. Casement
refused to look for a few minutes and
.then glanced upward smiling derisive-
Jy.
After the formal evidence had been
presented, Casement rose and said,
"Bailey is not guilty. He has been
wrongfully included

TABERNACLE
METINGS Oil
CLOSING WEEK
, -EREST FROM SATURDAY TO
OAY NIGHT WENT FOR
V r7. WITH A RUSH. EVANGEL
IST V,
-INGERS EXCEL.
The tabernucle meeting are now
entering upon their fifth land last
week. The interest from Saturday af
ternoon to Sunday night went forward
by leaps and bounds. No report can
give anything like an adequate state
ment of the progress. Boys and girls,
;men and women, young men and
maidens came forward for renewal
restoration and conversion as at no
other time in the present campaign.
Something mysterious which is noth
ing other than the Spirit of God, came
upon the people In great power. With
more than usual force the evangelist
spoke, and the singer sang, while the
people awoke to their duty to with
hold their tongues from criticism, and
to work and pray with all their hearts.
The meetings are now where they
ought to have been earlier In the
series.. As it is, there Is left only one
more week for this united efTort which
Is not likely to occur again for some
years, untold good has been accom
plished. The last week can be made
the richest of all. Every plan and ef
fort on the part of the evangelist and
the churches from now to the close,
will be cumulative in force. Some
thing special for every afternoon and
evening is the order. It has required
some time to gain the right ff way
for this mission in the business
thought and interest within our city.
This kind of work is the very best city
business. In spite of- all our trade
and local products, this would be a
most undesirable place to live and
rear our families, if there was no
evangelical Christian faith here and
no enterprising pastors and churches.
The city ought to turn out in mass
and put the stamp of universal ap
proval Upon this greatest of all con-
f Ume and eternlty,
wfla ,ntpnHp(1 for Saturday nieht
l to (hold only a short service. The
evangelist timed his address accord
ingly. It was based on Acts 3:19 "Re
pent therefore and turn that your
sins may be blotted out." An unusual
thing occurred, the speaker first de
livered his sermon and bethought him
self in time to announce his text just
about the close. He showed by very j
clear argument, apt illustration and j
personal incidents that the truth was .
very plain to those who were willing
to obey the same; that the seat of the
difficulty in accepting Christ is in the
heart anil not In the head. In this
meeting we caught a glimpse of the f tIlis sli!P- The fir-st "lK'-stion

was most appropriate to the stage of
the meetings. The discussion was
with great pathos, Christian sympathy
and spiritual insight. The closing ap

an exalted spiritual vision, crushed

The report of a large new refinery
being assured for Ardmore, together
with the near realization of a $200,000
hotel, linked with a modern six-story
office building and continued rumors
of other big things in a development
line in store for this city, has stirred
the business men to action to secure
the united co-operation of the entire
citizenship of Ardmore and to em
bark In a systematic advertising cam
paign to bring this city to the notice
of t lie outside world more conspicu
ous! ythan ever.
There is to be a meeting of the
business men tonight at 7:30, when
definite plans are to be made and
the first effort will be directed at
getting every man in the city to a
mammoth booster meeting within the
next two weeks, when they will b
told exactly what is assured and what
is contemplated for Ardmore.
Apart from the practical assurance
of the Roxana refinery, which will
be one of the biggest in the state,
local oil interests made the announce
ment Saturday that they are seriously
contemplating one also.
The Ardmore Railway company,
now in the hands of local men with
unlimited capital at their back, are
planning to keep pace with the de
velopment of the city and do some
on their own account. The Ardmore
Gas company has practically com
pleted its arrangements for an unlim
ited supply of gas, and is awalnting
miles of twelve-inch pipe. Altogeth
er, there is an expenditure of more
than a half million dollars provided
for with three times that amount con
templated and prospective for the
very near future.
It looks like Ardmore has a good
excuse for a big booster meeting, and
that it will be the largost in the his
tory of the city is confidently ex
pected. TWO INJURED WHEN

UNIVERSITY STUDENT IS
AC
CUSED OF GIRL'S MURDER
SUICIDE HIS DEFENSE STATE
ALLEGES POISON.
Waukegail, 111., May 11. Will II,
Orpet, University of Wisconsin stu
dent, accused of the murder of 18-year-old
Marion Lambert of the su
burb of Lake Forest will be placed on
trial Monday at Waukegan. The dt
fense will contend the girl killed
herself by taking poison, while the
state will allege (hat Orpet induced
her to swallow the poison by telling
her that it was a medicine which
would relieve a- condition for which
he was responsible.
On the morning of Feb. 10, 1916,
Marion Lambert, 17 years old, was
found dead, half burled in snow, in
a wood near the Sacred Heart Acad
emy at Lake Forest, 111., by her fath
er, Frank Lambert, employed as care
taker on the Jonas Kuppenheimer
estate, south of Lake Forest.
Beside her were her school books.
The body evidently had been In the
snow for more than 21 hours and was
frozen. TJicre were no marks of vio
lence on the body and the cause of
her death until an autopsy revealed
that she had succumbed to a power
ful poison.
Early February 9, she left her home
for school as usual, saying she would
not return until late. When she did
not return in time for supper that
night her father became alarmed and
went to find her. He searched the
vicinity all night and next morning
found her body in the snow and
notified the Lake Forest authorities.
Josephine Havls, a chum of the
victim at the Deedficld township high
school, told of having met her at the
Lake Forest station of the Chicago
and Milwaukee Electric railway the
morning she disappeared. They usu
ally went to school together, but that
morning the Lambert girl said she
had some business to attend to and
was not going to school. Miss Davis
aid the last she saw of Miss Lambert
was when she waved good-bye to her
and started alone through the woods
toward the Sacred Heart Academy.
The first clew which led to the
knowledge that the girl had a com
panion in the woods, and might have
been murdered, was the discovery of
the footprints of a man In the snow.
Inquiry showed that Will H. Orpet,
a university or Wisconsin siuueni,
who lived in Lake Forest, had been
keeping company for many months
with Miss Lambert and that the girl
had been despondent because of a
overs' quarrel. The romance was
known to Josephine Davis and others
of the girl's friends.
Orpet, whose father was gardener
for Cyrus If. McCormick, in Lake
Forts, appeared at his parents' home
two days after the girl's body had
been found, and after being question
ed by the police-admitted having met
her in the woods on the morning of
her disappearance. Ho denied all
knowledge of the manner in which
she met death.
He said he met her by appointment
to tell her he could not keep company
with her any longer because he was
engaged to marry another girl. He
talked with her for a while, he said,
and then left her standing in the
woods. That was the last time he
saw her alive, according to his story.
He said he first read of her death
in a Madison, Wis., paper.
The bottle which contained the poi
son w hich caused the girl's death was
never Nfound, although detectives
searched for it for weeks.
A circumstantial case against Orpet
was built up bit by bit by the police
and he formally was charged with
murder February 12. Later he was
held without bail as a result of the
coroner's inquest, and then indicted
by the Lake, county grand jury.
Suits Filed Saturday.

to hang him from the suspension
bridge, but the suggestion that he be

was dragged to the city hall, chained
to a tree securely, and the fire started.
When the flames had Bubshjed some
what, a number of the crowd cut off
the negro's fingers and other parts of

WOR'S JOB
SUCCESSOR TO MAYOR MULLEN
WILL BE CHOSEN NEXT YEAR
SEVERAL SEEM WILLING TO
SERVE.
The fact that we are to have a
primary election, , also' the general
election this fall, when state, county
and national officers will be chosen
for another term has not caused tho
citizens of Ardmore to overlook tho
fact that we are also going to have
to select a new set of city officials
in 1917, and already there are sev
eral aspirants who are "in the hands
of their friends," and will serve the
deaf, pee-pul if the aforesaid dear
people will only select them when
the time conies.
Mayor Mullen Has stated that he
would not bo a candidate for re-election.
He may be persuaded, however,
to change his mind before the time
comes, and make a try for another
term.
The city hall houses several who
have their eyes on the mayor's Job,
and it would not be surprising to see
one or more of the present city
commissioners in the ring when the
time comes.
Two other citizens have been prom
inently mentioned for tho job, and
they arc W. R. Roberts, ex-mayor,
and J. M. Hoard, former city com
missioner, who resigned from tho
present board, some Ume ago. Both
have declined to make a direct state
ment, but it Is evident that they have
designs on the job, and may be heard
from another year.
Just how many of the present
board of city officials will ask for re.
election is not definitely known at
the present time, but it is predicted
that all who will not take a shy at
the mayor's job will ask tho people
to return them for another term.
With the county primary coming
on in August, and the general elec
tion ln November, together with tho
city primary in the opening months
of the coining year, there ought tc be
enough politics to satisfy the most
ardent fan for a long time to cume.
