wheels of Lake county justice turned
slowly today In the mystery of Holms
woods, where pretty Marian Lambert,
high school girl, met her death, and
for whose murder William H. Orpet,
Wisconsin University Junior, Is to go
to trial.
While visitors, reporters, and pho

beginning of the trial, Judge Charles

presiding judge, delayed his arrival, and
the actual start of the trial was post
poned until this afternoon.
Pacing nervously In his cell at the
Lake county jail, Orpet, a youth of
twenty-one. was piqued at the delay.
Automobiles, buggies, and bicycles
sped Into Waukegan from Lake Forest,
where Marian Lambert and the youth
charged with her murder lived. The
Lake Forest High Bchool roll call
found several students, friends or
Marian, missing this morning.

SANTIAGO. Chile, May 15.-Tho Ger

today, refused to pay Chile the ex
penses of the crew of the' German
cruiser Dresden, interned by Chile, fol
lowing tho engagement off Juan Fer
nandez Island several months ago, in
which the Dresden was sunk by British
warships.
Germany alleges that the crew of
the Dresden aro not Interned under the
definition of International law because
the Dresden was sunk within the terri

of Chilean neutrality.
Sho holds that tha German sailors
are entitled to tho same treatment as

he included in It the opinions of many

Details of Brigadier Oenerat Persh

Columbus showed that, now they are

In rciltlon to make a rapid clean-up ot
potential raiders.
It is assumed Memlcan Ambassador
designate Arredondo will ask to see
Secretary Lansing soon on pending
diplomatic questions, though neither
side has shown haste recently to dis
cuss the Carransa suggestion for Amer
ican troop withdrawal. Much of the
need for this was eliminated in ths
Scott-Obregon conference.
Stories that the American lines are
threatened by Carranslstas are doubted
by army men. The 1.W0 Cararnilstas
below the Big Bend are there by ex
press agreement to assist In rounding
up the Boqullla and Glenn Springs
raiders.
Before the end of the week the recent

Developing Swift Offensive
Movement, Grand Duke's
Army Crosses Border.
petroora'd. May i5.-Deveioping a
swift offensive movement in the ex -
treme south, the Russians have crossed
the Persian frontier southwest of Lako
Urumlah. and are now within eighty
miles of the main line or communica
tion ot the Turkish army south ot
Bagdad.
The Slavs have reached the region
or Rowanduz, several miles inside the
Turkish frontier. They are ma'-chlng
westward toward tho ruins of anclint
Nineveh and the Mesopotamian city of
Mosul. Unless speedily checked by the
Turks within a fortnight they will be
threatening to cut off th Turkish
forces holding back the British at Kut-ttl-Amara.
No developments ot tho grand duke'k
successful t offensive In the Caucasus
has brought such surprise as the news
or the appearancs of another rtusslan
army near the Turks' line of com
munication. For several weeks the offldlal com
muniques have been almost entirely si
lent on the progress of the Russian
force operaUng In the Lake Urumlah
district of Persia. When the curtain or
secrecy waa lifted, the Russian army
was disclosed well across the Turkish
frontier and moving westward apparent
ly without serious resistance.
That the grand duke haa outwitted
the Turks and their German tutors Is
the belief here. Following the victories
at Erzerum and Treblzond. the Russians
pushed on In the direction of Eralngan
and nlarbakr. as if to cut off the Turk
ish Bagdad armies by a drive through
the latter City.
The Turks moved re-enforcements
eastward from Constantinople' and
strengthened their lines on the Erxln-gan-Bltles
front to meet the expected
attack. Meanwhile the Russians' left
wing entered Mesoptamla at a point 300
miles southeast ot the region in which
the main Turkish force was concen
trated. French Retake First
