San Aiitonio, Tex., June *1.—Gener
al Pershing has given the Mexican
troops an opportunity to make good
their threat to attack him if he
moved east or west, but the Mexicans
declined the issue.
He sent a small force eastward to
Ouiman, about 36 miles from his line
of communication yesterday to inves
tigate a report that a concentration of
Mexican troops had been made there.
He reported the Incident to General
Funston today, adding that the de
tachments had returned/without find
ing any Mexican troops in that vi
cinity.
Remembering General Trevino's
threat to attack Americans if they
moved in any but a northerly direc
tion, officers here regarded .his failure
to do so as Indication of reluctance on
his part to carry out .his..threat.

War Department Getting Ready to Send Militia to Border
at Once—Prepare to Throw Fighting into Enemy
Country, Should the Struggle Come.
Washington, June 21.—Strong pressure is being
brought to bear upon Carranza by representatives of Euro
pean powers to prevent him from forcing a break with the
United States. Indirect reports reaching the state depart
ment today told of these efforts, and said there was a pos
sibility that they would be successful.
An overnight dispatch from Special Agent Rodgersj
at Mexico City, received at the stale department today,
said arrangements were concluded satisfactorily for a spe-'
cial train to carry out Americans and foreigners to Vera
Cruz. He reiterated the hope that it start today, taking
many of the 600 Americans still in the capital.
A number of dispatches were received from consular
officers throughout Mexico. They agreed that tension
everywhere is keyed to a high pitch. Another message
from Rodgers said the train leaving Mexico City yesterday
carried a special car with 30 Americans, mostly women.
Agencies of the entente allies arc understood to be
active for peace, particularly as they believe German in
fluence sought to inflame the Mexican government against
the United States, with a view of preventing this country
from gathering in the trade formerly controlled by Ger
many in Mexico, South and Central America.

guardsmen have been mustered Into the federal service the war de
partment will act on General Funston's report, of yesterday, stating
the number of unite he desired, and to what points he desired them
forwarded.
QUESTION OF WAR OR PEACE UP TO CARRANZA.
Washington. Jnne 21.—Question of war or peace today depended
upon the attitude of General Carransa toward the American note re
fusing to withdraw the troops. Before the grist of the day the repots
began coming into the various departments, high officials admitted
privately that they look for war, although care was taken to avoid any
formal expressions or acts which might appear forerunners of a
declaration of war. Military authorities looked for the defaeto gov
ernment's attitude In Mexico threatening troop movements near the
border today, and in preparation for these the war department is get
ting ready to act on Funston's request for the immediate despatch of a
number of national guard units to the border.
It was said that Secretary Baker and the president probaMy
would determine what organisations should he sent. Several days r*T
elapse before any great number of militia units can be mustered tnto
the federal service. Reports of great enthusiasm and rapid recruit
ing continue coming In from many states today.
Should the Mexicans attack the American column, it Is probsMe
that a general rapid advance win be ordered from the border to the
line, perhaps 100 or more miles south of border. This line
win
fortified and held until volunteer reinforcements become available.
Thus the fighting will be thrown Into the enemy's territory and the
border protected against further bandit attacks by a thorough policing
of the country behind the main line.
Prepare for Trouble.
Douglas, Ariz., June 21.—Quiet pre
parations on the part of the officers
of the Arizona district of the United
States border patrol to meet any pos
sible development, the arrival here of
increasing numbers of American refu
gees from the mining districts south
of the international line and repeated
assurance of both Mexican and Amer
ican officials that law-abiding citizens
of the opposite nationality need fear
no harm, marked developments In
this section during the day.
One of th» outstanding features of
the situation here was the faith ex
pressed almost unanimously by Amer
icans in the promised protection to
foreign residents of 8onora by Gen
eral P. Ellas Calles, commander of the
Carranza forces of the state. Ths
only fear apparently was that some
Mexican troops or citizens might get
beyond his control should disorders
occur in other parts of Mexico.
Details of their detention by armed
Mexican civilians at Cananea Satur
day night were given today by scores
of refugees reaching here from that
mining camp. The following series of
events there were related:
An official of Cananea received a
telegram from Hermoslllo Saturday
night, stating that the United States
had Intervened in Mexico-' The mes
sage was read to the Mexican audi
ence in a theater. A large number
of the American residents of the min
ing camp were attending a dance. The
first intimation they' had' of trouble
was when the Mexicans after arming
themselves took charge of all horses
and automobiles owned by citisens of
this community. The dance hall was
surrounded by Mexicans who passed
before the doors and windows, dis
playing their arms.
Many were frightened for a short
time but It was decided to continue
dancing. At o'clock in the morning
the Mwicans ordered them to go to
their homes, laying particular stress
upon ths fact that they would go to
their own homes.
Several attempted to leave the town
but they were met In every direction
by patrols of citisens who ordered
them back.
When morning .came the- Mexican
authorities ordered the return of all
horses and automobiles Jto the AmeH
cans and later all ware informed they
could leave for the border. Several
automobiles were more or less dam
aged by the aitempfek of the Mexlcahi
te driVe thein^danng the night.

Pershing on Verge of
Fight with Carranzistas
Columbus, N. M., June ll.—•Car
ransista troops and soldiers of Oen
eral Pershing's expeditionary com
mand south of Namiquipa are on the
verge of hostilities, according to re
ports from the field last night. A
wireless dispatch from Colonel D. C.
Cabell, General Pershing's chief of
staff, said that the attitude of the
Carransistas was such that American
motor truck supply trains are In dan
ger of being fired upon.
.The Carranzistas are said to hwre
mounted artillery in positions menac
ing the Americans and dispatches in
dicated thait with the two commands
in -close proximity the danger of a
clash is increasing.
Persistent rumors were current
here last night that General Pershing
has split his command into thrae
columns, efch prepared to mow* In
the event of hostilities, while others
said that truck trains had been fired
upon. However, no confirmation of
the reports could be obtained at mili
tary headquarters here.
