BILTON GETS PART
OF PARROTT ESTATE
Move to Close Herbert St.
Follow Many Other Such
Proposals.
As a result of rumors that the
Whitney property on North Washing
ton avenue had been sold for factory
purposes, it has been disclosed that
large interests have been seeking
control of much property in the vi
cinity with the result that both sales
and options have been frequent.
The R. E. Parsons Foundry Co.,
which under the direction of Clarence
B. Bilton recently become associated
with the interests of the Standard
Manufacturing Co., and removed to
Frederick street, yesterday bought
from the Parrott estate the remain
ing control of Frederick street, be
tween Randall and North Washington
avenues.
With applications for the closing of
Frederick street and Merriam tetreet
already made to the common council.
It Is intimated that request will , now
be made for the closing of Herbert
street, with a view of the Parsons
Foundry Co.'s. enlarging the capacity
of their new plant.
Clarence B. Bilton, whose energy
is responsible for the acquisition of
this big tract of land, which extends
from Housatonic avenue on the west
more than 200 feet to the east of
Frederick street, and from Randall
to North Washington avenues denies
that he has purchased the Whitney
tract or the waterfront property of
Henry E.Parrott adjoining the' Whit
ney property on North Washington
avenue. ' .
It was learned today, that this piece,
200 feet front on the avenue and with
250 "feet of water frontage is held
under option by -the Bridgeport
Realty Co. in the Connecticut Na
tional Bank building. J. C. Berkwit,
head of that company, admitted that
the firm had procured an option on
the property yesterday but ,., -denied
that it was to' be -used in connection
with the reported Whitney sale, re-t
puted to have been made at a figure
approximating $72,000.
Though all effort to authenticate
the names of the supposed purchasers
of the Whitney property have as yet
been unavailing, the presence of enor
mous deposits St sand and gravel on
the property with the possibility of a
great realty development in the north
and east ends has led to- persistent
reports that a large sand and gravel
concern had purchased the property
and contemplated erecting an extens
ive plant. The name of Goodwin &
Gallagher, of New York, among the
largest dealers in the United States In
masons' and builders materials, has
been frequently mentioned. The
likelihood of their coming is, how
ever, scouted in ' competitive enter
prises here.
Find Meade's Machine
Wrecked Against Pole
With one ' mudguard, a headlight
and the front wheel and axle broken

that ' the car was the property of J.
J. Meade of 27 Murray street, Ansonla,
and had been stolen last' night. I
When found by Policeman Michael
Quilty, the car was against a tele
graph pole and evidently had been

ence of liquor. It was towed to the
yard at police headquarters . this
morning.

Building Soon. '
As a result of the "No card, no
work" action taken on Mondav bv the
Building Trades Council, which result
ed in the tie-up of 10 construction pro
jects in Bridgeport, it was reported
by labor organizations today that the
Southern New England Telephone Co.
has released itself from the ban and
that work on its new building will
proceed under strict union regula
tions. Scftwartz Brothers Co., which held
a sub-contract under Dowling & Bot
tomley, general contractors, are re
ported as having withdrawn from the
work, which will be completed by
Dowling & Bottomley.
Similar action is expected in the
court house work, which will come to
a critical situation when theslate
roofing on the new section begins. Tho
Slate & Tile Roofers' local has refused
to permit its men to continue work on
the edifice until other workmen now
being employed are unionized.
xn a letter aaaressea by the Build
ing Trades council to every contractor
and builder in Bridgeport today the al
lied crafts call attention to the fact
that "all local unions" are affiliated
in the building trades council. The
letter further points out that both em
ployer and labor benefit by harmoni
ous relations, which are not existent if
one oraft is treated fairly and another
unfairly.
It is therefore advocated that to
bring about fully harmonious condi
tions that contracts for work be ex
ecuted in future with a specific clause
that union labor only shall be em
ployed, thus insuring the best wferk
and the best conditions. The aid of
the building crafts Is freely offered to
any builders who may wish advice on
labor matters of any kind.
OWNERS OF TUG
MUST GIVE BACK
INSURANCE CASH
Captain Ventured Into
Sound Despite Storm Sig
nals, Is Finding.
Suit for the return of nearly $30,-
000 irfeurance paid for the loss of car
goes and boats of four tows taken from
Bridgeport harbor Sunday, March 1,
1914, has been won in the Federal
courts against the owners of the tug
Salutation, which has plied between
this port and ., New York for many
years under the mastership of Captain
Kniffin.
Following a final hearing in the dis
trict court of the United States in New
York last Saturday when many prom
inent Bridgeport shipping and weather
experts were summoned to give testi
mony. Judge Hough in a memorandum
decision rendered a verdict in favor of
the Providence-Washington Insurance
Co., which had libelled the tug Saluta
tion for insurance money already paid
owners of boats and cargoes.
In the hearing it was shown that on
the day in question storm signals had
been set, the barometer had fallen
steadily and other tows then seeking
shelter in the harbor had refused to
face the promised gale. The Saluta
tio, however, disregarded the' United
States weather signals in favor of the
personal seafaring experience of its
captain, though his opinion differed
from that of other captains who sought
shelter inside the breakwater at that
time.
As a result, four tows had to be cut
adrift off Charles Island after their
crews were assembled upon one bargJ
and the four loaded barges later foun
dered. In his memorandum Judge
Hough finds "No man has a right to
put his own opinions against the result
of many years experience and finds
negligence in not inquiring for official
weather reports.".

Judge Webb Denies
Separation to Hoar
That the court intends to make the
strictest interpretation of the new state
law allowing divorce on the ground
of insanity was indicated this morning
when Judge James H. Webb in the
superior court refused to grant a de
cree to Charles F. Hoar of Darien.
The petitioner claimed his wife Mabel
H. Hoar had been confined in an in
sane asylum but he admitted that for
periods of several weeks she had been
given her freedom and had lived out
side the institution.
The new law provides that a per
son to procure a divorce on this
ground must prove the defendant has
been an inmate of some institution
for five continuous year and has been
adjudged incurably insane. The fact
that the woman had been released on
several occasions convinced the court
that under the law Hoar was not en
titled to a decree. The parties in the
action were married in 18 83. Hoar
declared his wife had been insane since
1908.

Despatches received from Mexico
City at the local Mexican consulate
here said, in substance, that a decree
had been issued by the de facto gov
ernment, holding that any foreigner
acquiring real estate in Mexico either
by purchase or by contract, must re
nounce first his allegiance to his na
tive country and register himself as a
Mexican citizen. It further ordered
that any persons seeking to transfer
his property to a foreigner must ob
tain' permission from - the . proper au
thorities. Only preliminary reports on the
progress of the mobilization in var
ious states had reached the War de
partment today. These were viewed
as satisfactory. Secretary Baker said
the suggestion that the senior class at
West Point military academy be
graduated immediately for active ser
vice was under consideration but no
decision had been reached. The ca
dets have completed three years of
their work and could be commission
ed as second lieutenants immediately

Danger of War Heightens
Excitement About Guards
Trip to Camp.
The present. . prospect of armed
clash with Mexico and the fact that
National Guard in other parts of the
state has been called ' to the colors
by the governor will add much interest
to the departure for camp tomorrow
of the Connecticut Coast Artillery or
ganizations stationed here. The Sec
ond, Fourth and Eleventh companies
and the band and hospital corps have
been ordered to Fort H. G. Wright for
a 10 days 'tour of duty.
The artillery have been ordered to
report at the armory at 7:30 o'clock.
Assembly will be sounded at 8 o'clock.
The men will go in service uniform
and "m heavy marching order, carry
ing shelter halves, . blanket rolls,
haversacks, canteens and mess kits.
There will be a parade from the ar
mory down Main street to State street
to Courtland street to Fairfield ave
nue to the railroad . station. The
companies will entrain at 8:58 and
will arrive in New London shortly
before 11 o'clock. There the entire

REGIMENT CN
BE RAISED HERE
IF CALL COMES
Men Prominent in Civic and
Patriotic Organizations
Discuss Crisis.
That a regiment of volunteers can
be easilv raised in this city if needed
is the belief of many prominent citi
zens and officials. The matter of the
President's call for National Guard
organizations was the subject of dis
cussion by members of Franklin' Bart
lett camp, No. 11, Sons of Veterans, at
their meeting last night but no formal
action was taken. In the event of war
with Mexico, however, the camp will
probably open a recruiting office and
raise at leaaC a battalion from its own
membership and the sons of soldiers
f the Civil war.
At the outbreak of the war with
Spain the camp opened a recruiting
office in Cannon street. The late Wil
liam B. ' Disbrow, former quartermaster-general
of the state and former
commander of Ellas Howe, Jr., Post
No. 3, G. A. R-, allowed the use of his
office for the purpose. A battery of
light artillery was raised and those
who joined procured their own uni
forms. The Vorganization offered its
services to the governor, but was not

Strong pressure is . being I
brought to bear upon General
Garranza by representatives of !
European powers to prevent I
him from causing a break with I
the United States. Indirect re-
ports reaching the state depart-
ment today told of these efforts i
and said there was a possibility j
they would be successful.
Agencies of the entente allies
are understood to be active for
peace, particularly because
they believe German influence
has sought to inflame the Mexi

United States with a view to
preventing this country from
gathering in trade formerly
controlled by Germany in Mex
ico, South and Central America.
It is pointed out that Car- i
ranza might avoid war by call-
ing for an international com
mission to discuss, the border
situation as provided for in the
treaty of 1848. .So far, how- :'
ever, no suggestion for suclr i
step has come from Mexico. A
definite statement has been re
ceived that Carranza is doing ,
all in his power at this time to ,
protect Americans in Mexico i
from attack by the populace.
Mr. RoVlgers reporteoV-that he j
and his diplomatic associates in j
the Mexican capital had been j
given every assurance of safe j
conduct and protection on their j

necessary for them to leave.

Paris, June 21 Mexico is placing
its case before the European public
in the form of statements issued by
Mexican legations on the continent, j
Such a statement appeared in Madrid j
on Monday and. a similar statement is
printed in the French press today j
from the Mexican legation in Paris. It !
says that reports that war is inevita-
ble and that General Carranza's at- 1
titude is due. to German intrigue came )
from American sources. '
"Imputations against the govern- ''
ment of General Carranza," it de- j
clares, "are unwarranted. Mexico j
has not wished and does not wish war j
with the United States." I
The statement reviews the nego- '
tiations for permission for American ;
troops to cross the frontier to pursue
bandits and declares that the inter
changes were Interrupted by the send
ing of ap expeditionary corps, consti
tuting a violation of Mexican sover- j
eignty.
"We are authorized to state that:
it is not Mexico which attacks," the 1
statement , continues. "In ordering I
General Trevino to prevent American
forces from advancing south, east or j
west, the Mexican government is pure- j
ly defensive. This is established from
documents in this legation which wil)
be published at an opportune time."
