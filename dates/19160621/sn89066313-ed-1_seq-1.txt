in Columbia this morning. "It's too
cold in winter, and too rainy in sum

all."
However, the wheat cutting in Boone

sav the jield will not be more than
half a
a crop and the aerage for the j
will be about ten bushels to
count
the acre. The long freeze last win
ter smothered the crop so that the
stand in the fields is thin. South of
town are a few exceptional fields that
will run perhaps twenty bushels.
The oats crop is by far the best
prospect the farmer has, according to
opinion. It will aeragc about thirty
bushels the count oer. One farmer
ventured to say, "Psaw, it'll beat that;
j on bet it will."
Because of the backward season and
the heay rainfall the farmers almost
refuse to put an estimate on the corn
crop. Some planting will finish with

sa
The corn that is up varies. The
aerage field is about knee-high
and stands well on the ground The
earl plantings, however, stand waist
high and are of good color. The cool
weather is not the best for the crop;
in its present stage warm rains and
sunshine are the things needed to
make the lorn do well. Xo damage
of any kind has been reported up to
this time, and the prospects arc fa
orabIc. The hay crop promises about a 90
per cent average. The meadow lands
are in the best of condition and arc
growing fine forage for stock. The
cloer and blue grass are growing
fast and making the best jield that
has been made in the last three jears.
The first cutting of the alfalfa crop
was begun about three weeks ago, and
although it is not one of the impor
tant crops it is raised to some ev
tent by farmers In this Iciinity. The
growth is good and in all probabilities
there will be the usual three cuttings,
which promise to be heay.
The farmers promise to hae sweet
corn roasting cars in town by the
middle of July.

The committee appointed by the City
Council to decide the question regard
ing tree trimming has as jet reached
no definite decision A meeting was
held at the City Hall jesterday after
noon to discuss the problem, but this
proved unsatisfactory.
Those who had made the worst
complaints were not present, so we
could not hear their arguments," said
Councilman 0 1). Kellogg this morn
ing "Before any decision can be
reached it will be necessary to get
suggestions from those who arc in
touch with forestry and landscape
gardening, and in addition to find out
what other public service corpora

"The council recognizes the fact
that both trees and plants are the
citizens' property, and is trying to ar
range affairs for tehir good."

with modifications, by Judge David 11.
Harris in the Circuit Court this morn
ing. Tlie temporary injunction, granted
April l.'i, prevented delivery of liquor
shipments by railroad and express
companies except to druggists and
pharmacists.
The permanent injunction granted
by JuMge Harris prevents the ship

In regard to interstate shipments.
Judge llairis ruled that the state can
not interfere with those except under
the provisions of the Webb-Kenvon
Act. According to the Webb-Ken on
Act, a state tan prohibit interstate
shipments only to the person that vio
lates the state laws.
Another modification indicated by
Judge Harris is that persons can re

"The Mexicans live like cattle." This
sentence was used frequently by Mr.
Sexton in his interview. "Then, too,

Case of Company Members.
It has not yet been decided whether
the University faculty men in the Co

will leave for the Xevada camp tonight,
will be given a leave of absence and

President A. Ross Hill is now out

just what action the Executive Hoard
will take at its meeting on July 1.
Company I, which was the Colum

of Missouri in the Spanish-American
War, was composed entirely of stu
