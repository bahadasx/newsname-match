THE MAZATLAN AFFAIR.
Report Received Gives No Record of
Any American Casualties.

from American warships under any
circumstances, wore delivered to the
State Department to-day by an em
bassy secretary.
First! News of Trouble.
Tho embassy communications
.brought the Washington government
its first news of trouble at Mazatlan.
According to tho Mexican version
confusion came after an attempt to
land maiines from a warship. There
was an exchange of shots and two
American officers were arrested and
held until explanations had been
made. Tho embassy presented a re
port from tho military commander at
Mazatlan, Gen. Mezto, telling of the
incident, accompanied by instructions
from tho Mexico City foreign office
urging that, tho Americans be kept
aboard their ships.
Gen. Mezto's report said the men
landed at Mazatlan were marines, but
as the gunboat Annapolis, the only
ship known to he stationed there, haj
no marines aboard, lt is presumed
that bluejackets were involved. Tho
Mezto report told this story:
Mexican Story.
"A boat from the warship ap
proached tho Mazatlan wharf, and
was warned off until permission to
land could be obtained from the
military authorities, lt departed,
but oevoral hours later returned, with
its crew armed. Tho officer in com

ranza, addressing a masa meeting in
front of his residence last night,
urged the citizens to refrnin from
hostile acts against Americans and

tween Mexico and the United States.
The first chief said In part:
"This is not the time for hasty ac
tion. 1 am trying to arrange our dif
ficulties with the United States pacif
ically and have hopes of succeeding.
I want you to aid mc.
"The encounter between American
soldiers and .Mexicans near Matanio
ras has been temporarily solved with
the withdrawal of American troops
from that region. The matter is now
being taken up diplomatically. There
waB some trouble in Mazatlan caused
by thc intrusion of American sailors,
and that has also 'been adjusted for
tho time being.
"Go to your homes and be good
Mexicans, remembering also tint I
will do my utmost to preserve the
dignity of the Mexican nation. If we
are forced to resort to arms I will
lead you in person."
A crowd composed of several thou
sand people cheered the remarks of
thc first chief. Early In the evening
a big demonstration had been made
in front of the national palace, and
afterward the demonstrators paraded
through the principal streets of the
city. The metropolis is perfectly
calm and Gen. Carranza's words are
expected to have a good effect in
maintaining this condition.
