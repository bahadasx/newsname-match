A Good Citizen Crosses Over
Last Saturday night, about 9:30 Mr.
Wm. Butler, who was born and reared
near Columbia, crossed the great di
vide, after a long illness. Had he
lived until the 9th of next October he
would have been eighty years old.
When the Civil war broke out he
and two brothers, N. G. and Josh But
ler, espoused the calise of the Union,
entered the Federal army and served
in the 13th regiment, Capt. O. B
Patteson's company, until hostilities
ceased He was a good soldier and
also a first-class citizen, one who will
vnot only be missed by his immediate
family, but ail who knew him inti
mately. He died with diseases inci
dent to old age, and in his passing, for
several days he slept his life out.
Some years ago he professed his faith
in Christ, united with the 'Christian
church, and was a faithful member
until the summons called him from the
walks of life. ,
In his association with his fellows,
he had a warm greeting:, a kind word
for every one he met. We never knew
of Bill Butler, as he was familiarly
called, speakihg unkind words of his
fellowman. Honest in all dealings,
with a heart full of love forthecom
panion of his bosom and a number of
devoted daughters, he passed through
the veil, to await the coming of his
earthly loved ones.
Besides his wife and children he
leaves three brothers and two sisters
to our knowledge. -
May God comfort them in this hour
of sorrow.
The funeral services were conducted
Sunday afternoon by "Eld. Z. T. Wil
liams in the presence of a large circle
of relatives and friends, and the inter
ment was in the Butler graveyard.

During these days of the high cost
of living the shrewd housewife de
mands her money's worth in all the
food she buys. To demand it is one
thing, but to actually receive it is an
other. You have a way of detecting short
measure, but how do you know you
are not receiving inferior quality?
In purchasing foodstuffs Jiow do you
determine whether or not you are re
ceiving your full raoney,'s worth? Do
you buy a certain brand because your
mother or grandmother alwajs used
it? Science lias improved foodstuffs
like everything else. If you use a cer
tain brand because it has proven "sat
isfactory to yott" how can you be sure,
that you are getting the best, keeping
abreast with the times, getting the
latest improvements?
In deciding upon different brands of
foodstuffs there is only one waj to
prove which gives the fullest value at
any. price, and that one way is results
that which proves "Best by Test."
A few manufacturers of food pro
ducts guarantee to refund your money
if their brands do not prove best.
Such firms and their products should
be patronized. Among these are the
makers of Calumet Baking Powder.
The Battle Cry of Peace.
Mr. Edgar Reed, Manager of the
Paramount Theatre, is making ar
rangements to take care of what is ex
pected to be the largest crowd that
ever attended a photo-play in Columbia
on July 1st, at the showing of the
"Battle Cry of Peace," the world's
greatest photo spectacle. Preparedness
is the basis of the story, a question on
which the greatest men of our nation
agree.
"The Battle Cry of Peace" is said
to be just as much a dramatic story
as a war-time spectacle. The story is
described as a happy and forceful com
bination of romance and tragedy with
a liberal sprinkling of comedy and
gayety.
Among the principals in the cast
are: Chas. Richmond, W. J. Furgu
son, said' to be the only surviving
member of the company which played
in Ford's theatre the night Lincoln
was assassinated, and Tliias Lawton,
the Louisville actress, who is cast as
"Columbia." Former Piesideut,
Roosevelt, Secretary of War Garrison,
Admiral Dewey, and other notables
appear in this picture."
This picture will be exhibited in the
afternoon and night, July 1st.
People from out of town should not
overlook the opportunity of seeing this
show in the afternoon.

Silas A. Sullivan, of Russell county,

To Our Patrons in Adair County.
We have something like twelve hun
dred subscribers in Adair county, and
it is not often that a home man is
asked to pay his subscription, but the
time" has come when we must deviate
from that rule. We need every dollar
that is due the office, and nine men
out of every ten have a good idea how
his account stands, We believe every
one who is behind intends to pay, and
many of them can pay as well one day
as another. They are all good gatrons,
but a large percent, of them have be
came neglectful, feeling that we do
not need ready cash to run the busi
ness. In that they are mistaken.
Just now we are compelled to pay 100
per cent, more for blank paper than
any other time since the News was
started, eighteen jears ago. Just
think. A ton of paper, laid down at
our door, costs 890.00, and the ton
lasting only seven weeks Do you not
think we need money?
