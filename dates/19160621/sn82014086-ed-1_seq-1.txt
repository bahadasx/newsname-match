Officials Dclisve That 48 Hours Will Discloss What
ths Immediate Future Has in Store
PRESIDENT WILSON'S
Mote in Plain Terms Accuses the
Brought Matters to the Virge of War by Open Hostilities
to the United States Repudiates Imputations of Bad
Faith Contained in the Last
zation of the National Guard is Proceeding Expeditiously
In Many States Recruiting Officers Are Crowded With
Applicants General Funstdn Has Notified Secretary
Baker That He Needs Guardsmen Immediately to Rein
force His Border Guard.
Washington, June 20. The issue of
war or peace with Mexico . hung in
tha balance tonight awaiting General
Carranza's decision as to the course
ha will pursue. Officials here believe
that forty -eight hours might bring a
tle&r understanding of what tne im
mediate future has in store.
Carranza Canaurcd.
" A note signed by Secretary Lansing,
conveying President's Wilson's rejec
tion of the deyiand for withdrawal of
American soldiers from Mexico, ac
companied by a specific warning that
n attack on the troops "wiil lead to
the gravest consequences," was tele
graphed to Mexico City today by Eli
sta Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
neaienate. In plain terms it accused
General Carranza of having brought
matters to the verge of war by open
hostility toward the United States and
failure to safeguard even the lives of
Americans in Mexico or on the border
from the lawless elements among his
Countrymen. '
Resents Imputations of Bad Faith.'
In rtc-rnest terms, the note repudi
et und resents imputations of bad
faith ni ulterior motives i brought
gainst the Washington government in
the Mexican communication to which
Itis a reply. General Carranba la in
formed in so many words that protec
tion of its own border is the only sub
ject sought by the United States and
Is told that that object will be pur
sued whatever tjie consequences may
be.
A Summary Telegraphed Mexico City.
When the note had been handed to
Mr. Arredondo for delivery to . hisl
chief, copies were sent to all embas
sies and legations for their informa
tion. A summary was telegraphed to
Special Agent Kodgera in Mexico City
that he might wisely counsel American
residents there. He will not commu
nicate it to Carranza officials. -
Arranged for a Refugee Train.
Mr. Rodgers reported during the day
that he had arranged for a refugee
train to carry Americans and other
foreigners from Mexico City to Vera
Crux. He expects to see it off tomor
row, but will remain at his post un
less a declaration of war or a delib
erate act of war by the de facto gov
ernment should make it necessary for
Dim . to leave.
Expeditious Mobilization.
While the United States awaits Car
ta na's next move, steps to make the
gorder secure against whatever may
romo are going steadily ahead. Mo
bilization of the national guardsmen
la proceeding expeditiously In all
states, and plans for sending Some of
them southward In response to a re
quest from General Fung nn are un
der way. Secretary Lansing today de
scribed the policy of the government
as being founded only on a resolve to
protect the, border. That policy has
not geen changed, he said, and no
military step that has been taken has
any other object. General Carranza
was officially informed of this in the
bote which went forward today.
Militia Needed Immediately.
To carry out his share in- the policy,
General Funston sent a long code des
patch to Secretary Baker today, indi
eating what portion of the 100,000
guardsmen ordered under arms he
tieeds immediately to reinforce his
torder guard. The points at which
he wishes the men mobilized and the
proportions of infantry, cavalry and
artillery he desires to have at each
place were included.
Preliminaries Discussed.
Assignment will be made from the
first state units to be mustered into
the service. Preliminary arrange,
tnenta were discussed today with rail,
toad officials for their prompt trans
portatlon to points selected by Gen
ral Funston.
Not Ready for Marching Order.
None of the guardsmen summoned
bnder President Wilson's call were
ready tonight for marching orders. It
tnay be several days before the first
reflmenta are mustered in, as the men
wil; have to be examined physically.
additional camp equipment assembled
for them and arrangements made for
the trains to carry them to the border.
The entire guard of the District of
Columbia will be under canvas tomor
row at Fort Myer. Va., ready for mus
ter. Several states also are expected
to complete their mobilization by to
morrow night and a decision maV then
be reached as to which forces .will be
moved nrst.
Recruiting Stations Crowded
War department officials are grati
fied at reports of crowded recruiting

NOTE VIEWED AS THE
i
FINAL WORD-TO CARRANZA
It Arraigns the De Facto V President
For Allowing Bandits to Roam at Will
Washington, June 20. The note de.
llvered today is viewed here as Pres.
Ident's final word to General Carran
za. It makes no overtures for furth
er discussion and leaves virtually no
question to 'be settled except one
whether the de facto government will
suppress outlawry against Americans.
It arraignes General Carranza by name
for having permitted bandits to "roam
at will through -territory contiguous to
the united States ' while he has seen
fit to recite ''groundless sentiments of
hostility" toward the expedition, sent
after , Villa and "to impute to this
government' ulterior motives , for 'the
continued, presence of American troops
On Mexican soil. -
. Secretary Lansing calls attention in
the note to many evidences of Car
ranza's hostile attitude as contained
in omciai reports ana asserts that the
steps toward clearing up the situation
in northern Mexico promised by Gen
cral Obregon at conferences with Gen
eral Scott, actually: have .constituted
a display of military force directed at
the American expedition and designed
to impede its operations. He affirms,
too. that Carranza has given his , sup
port to the press campaign of anti
American agitation "-in Mexico and
cites a published statement by the first
chief calling upon the Mexican people
to be ready for any- emergency and
intimating that with the United States
is impending, .
ARMY OFFICERS ADMITTED
PRIVATELY WAR IS IMMINENT
Say Carranza Haa Shown Determina
tion to Force the Issue.
Washington, June 20. Army officers
and high officials here 'admitted pri
vately their belief that war was -imminent,
since Carranza had given ev
ery indication of a . determination to
force the issue at any ..cost, but were
disposed to refrain from making any
statements that might serve to furAier
Inflame the minds of the Mexican peo
ple. - ' v ...
or the same reason the proposed
resolution to put into - immediate ef
fect the national guard provisions -of
the new army bill was not presented
m congress. The section of the bill
referred to contains the statement that
the men shall be called under the draft
'tor the duration of the "war," unless
sooner discharged. Because of this
phraseology and also 'because adoption
of tlie resolution would be only a mat
ter of a few minutes when needed,
leaders in congress determined to hold
it up until events show what is to be
expected beyond the border.
70,000 MEN ALONG THE
BORDER WITHIN A WEEK.
Entraining of First Troops Expected
to Begin Today.
Sari Antonio. Tex June 20. Facing
Carranza's army In northern Mexico
there will be stationed along the Rio
Grande within a week or ten days an
American force that will total, it was
stated today, almost 70,000 men. .
General Funston has requested the
war department to ; send him quickly
as possible a large part of the national
guardsmen ' and advices received late
today indicated that entraining of the
first troops .will begin tomorrow. As
fast as they arrive in the south the?
will be sent to tfce stations chosen. A
part will be brought to San Antonio
and held here as a reserve, but a part
of them will be within sight of Mexico
when they get oft ths trains. -
General Funston did not announce
bow many men he has asked for nor
the stations to which they will be
sent, but It is known that he expects
more than a division, and It was said
that not less than 28,000 men would
be sent-

SPECULATING ON PROBABLE .
f COURSE TO BE PURSUED

ered.
Washington. June 20. There was
much speculation hc-re on all sides to
night as to the probable course of the
president should Carranza order an
attack on General Pershing's men in
the face of the American government's
solemn warning. --..It ?vas generally be-
lieved that the hint , contained in Sec
retary Lansings . note that . military 1
occupation of northern Slpxlco has
oeen consiaerea as an alternative ax
times when the , situation beyond the
border ; appeared critical, might indi
cate the plan of action should war now
be forced" on the nation. . As a pre
liminary step to such an occupation
and pending an organization of an
armv of the size of such an undertak
ing would require, It was regarded as
possible that a general advance irom
the border to a line paralleling the
head of General Pershing's column at
Namiquipa might be undertaken. "With
American forces disposed along Such
line, holding important towns and
strategic points from ;Jhe Pacific to the J
Gulf coast, there would be1 no fear of
serious hostilities at the- border. Any
advancing Mexican force would be
subject to attack from the rear should
it move northward of this advanced
line. . - . -. .
