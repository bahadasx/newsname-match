Record Camp
About 170 farm boys who won honors
corn, potato, and pig club contest
work in Minnesota last year are to be
given free trips to the farm boys' camp
at the Minnesota State Fair, Sept. 4 to
9 as a reward of merit. The camp will
be nearly twice as large as any previous
one.
In counties where corn and pig club
contest work was conducted last year
the winner in each class is entitled to
the free trip, in case he is not less
than 16 years old not more than 19 years
old. In the northern counties many of
the boys who scored high in the 1916 po­
tato contest have been chosen. Some of
the older boys who attended the camp
last year will assist in the management
of the new members.
In former years the members of the
farm boys' camp have been chosen in es
say contests conducted in the different
counties, one boy being selected from
each county. The method of choosing
boys who have won honors in corn, po­
tato, and pig club contest work has been
substituted to assist the Minnesota Ag
rioulture College in stimulating interest
in juvenile farm work. Power of ap­
pointment rests with T. A. Eriokson,
University farm, St. Paul, state leader
of boys' and girls' contest work.

Hans Kasper's Residence Burned
The residence of Hans Kasper
was completely destroyed by fire
last Saturday afternoon. There was
no one home at the time, and the
fire was not noticed until after the
flames were breaking through the
roof, and there was no hope of sav­
ing anything. The fire engine was
immediately brought to the pond
back of the livery barn and put into
action, but by the time the water
was turned on* nearly the whole
building was in a blaze.
Mrs. Kasper and the children are
visiting in Minneapolis and Mr. Kas­
per had been home for his dinner
and had not been away from the
house more than an hour when the
fire was noticed.
The only article saved was a ba­
by buggy, which someone snatched
out of the blaze. The loss is esti­
mated at $1500. There was insur­
ance to cover about one-third the
value.
