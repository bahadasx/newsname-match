Guardsmen Are Mobilizing
Throughout the Nation, and
Boundary Expected Soon
Washington, JunV 11. Id vie of
. the incomplete mobilization of the
xollltla, the war department Indicated
It probably would not laaue orden
ending new forces to the Mexican
border today. ' '
The time of lenience of tbla order,
however, still waa In doubt, but offl
lals aay they would watt until auffl
lent mobllliatlon had been accom
plished before taking the step.
Secretary of War Baker aald hie
messages of the past 14 hour ehowed
no change In the altuatlon.
San Antonio, June 11. -The ma
Jorlty of the 100,000 additional
guardsmen now tnoblllilng through
out the country will begin to move
toward the Mexican border Immedi
ately their mobllliatlon la complete. If
the railroad are equal to the tank of
transporting them and their equip
ment. '
The mllltla, under direct ordera of
General Funston, will be Retributed
long the International tin from the
GuK or Mexico to California at once.
They will be assigned to patrol duty,
releasing the entire force or regulars
now engaged In that work for actual
Invasion of Mexico, In case war Is de
clared." A large reserve of mllltla
Iso will be stationed at Port 8am
Houston. The actual ' number of
guardsmen asked byFnnston tor Im;
mediate service la nof known yet, but
ha Indicated today that a Urge part
of tbelr total will be sent to the bor
der aa fast as they can be trans
ported. He said the remainder will
be called for In the event of hostili
ties). All branches of the service will be
Included In the movement southward.
But Fun-ton declined to state Just
how the various units will be distri
buted, aa such knowledge would give
the Mexicans a tactical advantage.
The states ffom which the first
troops will be called are to be chosen
by the war department, aa Funston
'.s expressed no preference in this
respect. The biggest factor In any
delay to be encountered by the-mllltla
will be In equipping them with
horses and mules. This leads to the
belief that the New York and Illinois
regiments will 'be the first to move, as
they already are well supplied with
nlmali.
The war department has wired
Funston to recruit four regiments of
Infantry and two of cavalry at once
for regular service. Detailed ln
atruotlona have been mailed. Recruit
ing will be started at once.
Reports have beou received that
Mexicans are assuming a threatening
attitude at OJlnaga. Funston says
they are "running around In circles,
bragging about what they Intend to
dO." ..'.:...'..
Official announcement was made
that General Pershing has found no
Mexican detachments moving at any
point within touch of his lines of com
munication. Pershing still has scout
ing parties out on both sides cf the,
line.

DEMOCRATS FOR '
STATE SUFFRAGE
Washington, June 11. President
Wllsrfn today Interpreted the suffrage
plank In the democratic platform as
being . an approval of the auffrage
movement, but as recommending that
It should have Its Inception In the
Individual states.
The president told Mrs. D. E. Hook
er, or Richmond, Va., or the Vir
ginia Federation or Labor, sent to
Wellington to present resolution
urging a constitutions! amendment
for woman suffrage, that the demo
cratic plank did not necessarily dis
approve the federal amendment Idea,
but recommended the movement be
taken up state, by state.
The Virginia federation denounced
the action of the house Judiciary com
mittee In not allowing the auffrage
question to reach the floor. The pre
sident, however, told Mrs. Hooker
Its did not fel It proper that he
should' Interfere with the committee'!
slCliUU. , ' , ,lt
He believes the wler course Is toi1
convert the states to suffrage first.''
Mrs. Hooker said, after her confer
ence. "I do not believe hs la totally
opposed to a federal amendment,
however." . , ...
The president's Interpretation of
lbs. pisiform plank came when Mra.
Hooker told him suffragists thought
the .plank, seemed .to,, be, .veiled In
mystery." The president , replied,
laughing:
'.' "You would seem lo accuse us of
Insincerity and buncombe," and then
proceeded. Mrs. Hooker said, 10 ex
plain what he thought was aproper
Interpretation or the .plank.
' Mrs." Hooker said If the democratic
congress does not take some action
on suffrage at this sesnlon., she reels
sorry ror the democratic party.
She added the auffrage workers' are
going to get to Hughes and. find out
where he stands, too.

An End,' ad; Machinery
ct State Crcnilisg
Washington, June 21. The Car-
ran government 1 nearlng Its end,
a high administration official said to
day. The' machinery is crumbling,
and only an unexpected, right-about-face
in Carranxa's method can, pre
vent the government'a complete dis
integration, ' this official declared,
even long enough for it to be re
placed by a . government sufficiently
strong to prevent near-anarchy In
the southern republic
.' Such a altuatlon has been predicted
for months by some war and stats
department official. Because the
administration., aa repeatedly an
nounced, publicly has Insisted on giv
ing the Carranxa . government every
chance to restore Mexico to, a real
sUtua among nations, such official
prophets have been given scant hear
ing. In some cases administration
officials have declared such prophe
cies have been unconfirmed by official
reports, saying unsettled conditions
exist only In Isolated eases. But to
day no official could be found who
did not admit, privately at least, that
"watchful waRlng" has i run Us
s
course., ,t. ;..nr , -. ;h! ..
Officials themselves today pointed,
to the note sent Carranxa as evidence
that President Wilson and Secretary
