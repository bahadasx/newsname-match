(By Associated Press)'
WASHINGTON, June 21.?Strong
pressure is being brought to bedr on
; General Carranza by representatives
ot European powers to prevent him
from forcing a break wtih the United
States.
Indirect reports reaching the State
department today told of these ef
forts and said ther was a possibility
they^wculd be successful. Agencies
of 'ithe entente allies are understood
to be active for peace particularly be
cause they believe German influence
i lias sought to inflame the Mexican gov.
I&nmient against the United States
^th a view to prevent this country
" m gathering in trade formerly con
lied by Germany in Mexico, south
1 Central America.
it is reported that Carranza might
avoid war by calling for an interna
tional commission to diBcusB the
border situation as provided tor in the
Mpfffel 1848.
So far however no suggestion for
>uch a step has come from Mexico.
A definite statement has *ben re
celved that Gen. Carranza Is doing all
the populace. He Is said to ha v. glv
en sni rJiil Agent Rodgers In Mexico
City all the aid Id his power In ar
ranging for trains to carry Amorlcan
f('.' refugees from the Intorlor to Vera
Cruz.
S? In some quarters here this was con
strued as evidence that he Is not bent
upon provoking hostilities.
The state department has no'advl
ces bearing out these hopeful Indica
tion except that from Special Agent
Rodgera announcing the progress ol
his efforts to get American citizens
out
With the full consent of the Car
ranza authorities, he said and the
promise of adequate protection from
possible bandit attacks ho had arran
ged for a special train to leave Mexico
city tomorrow carrying American to
Vera Crux.

Heavens Weep and Weeds
Grow Up in the Corn Fields
Wettest June for Several
Years May Yet Break
Records.
Since the famous "wet" June of
1914, which was the lust month he for*
\he Yost prohibition amendment to
west Vinginla's constitution went into
effect, the present Juno is probably
the most wet.
Truly this month has had so much
rainfall that those every present per-'
sons who delight in perpetrating para
phrases of tho.great poets ore saying,
"0 what is more rare than a day this
June when the sun shinerf."
Yesterday the sun .d|4.ghlne_anfl Jor
twelve* hours there was no rainfall.
This is the longest dry-period-of the
month that has been recorded so far.
June Jb -popuiarily' supplied to^be a
seemed to affect the 'percentage of
marriages yet it has affected Jhecdfji
crop and the lack,of sunshine has
retarded the growth' of the corn,-yet
has not seemed Jo affect the weeds
that are always found in t^e corn
fields. Tho other crops have probably
been more benfltted than damaged hy
the heavy rainfall and this promises
to be a bumper year in the state.
June last year while a- cool month
was considerably drier than usual the
average precipitation for the month
being only 3.63." The average precipi
tation for the past twenty-five daya is
4.43. The weteest June according to
the statists .of*the S.. Weather
Bureau was in 1907 when the averagt
precipitation for the month will'have I
an even higher average, than. this, if I
the prosont wot weather continue?. 1
This is not likely howe.ver, as the,law
of probabilities and the patent medt
cine almanacs both say that the lat
ter portion of this month will be 'd?y
and warm with all the rain saved up
until the Fourth of^Jufy. ... t
Locally the heavy rain early this
morning and throughout the day be
ing unaccompanied by high wind*
have done no damage. Buffalo creek
and Paw Paw creek were reported at
three o'clock this afternoon ? as ris
ing rapidly but no flood is anticipated.

PETROGRAD, June 2.?Correspond
ence of Tne Associated Press)?After
a year and a half of prohibition Iiussla
may be said to have successfully abol
ished the liquor traffic. The sale of
I Intoxicants since Emperor Nicholas
!put his signature to.the,ukase forbid
ding the trailic-at the"very outset "of
the war. has fallen irom nearljr a bil
lion rubles (5,00,000,000) yearly to
approximately four per cent of that
sum. This-four per cent largely con
jsisls of the sale of liquors for medi
cinal purpbses although in It" U**"ln
(included also a limited traffic in wines ;
for which there, is a restrictedT>ennlB~
Vodka formerly thefmbst easily ob
tainable commodity in Russia,, has be
come as rare as whiskey in -the mojt
strictly prohibition community In the !
United States. Wines arc still to be;
bad,, surreptitiously for Uie most
Sart, but also in, some caiis and un
er prescribed conditions, with the
knowledge of the authorities, but at
prices which limit sale to people ot
wealth or woeful extravagance. It Is
possible, in Petrograd and Moscow,
for instance, where the. ban, even on
wines, is strict, to purchase wines In
certain hotels but they may be served
only in private rooms, and ,the- privi
leges enjoyed by these institutions are
frequently interrupted by the police
tor some infraction of the restrictive
rules.
Ono of tho most noticeable results
of the almost complete" suppresion of
vodka naturally is the' disappearance
from the streeta -arid \ other public
places ot intoxicated persons. They
have become so rare ar to be 'more
or less a novelty./ People' observe
such-in a spirit of cuftous surprise,
doubtless the impulse ataong the'ma
jority being to wonder how he man
aged It This state of affairs offers
a remarkable contrast' to the ^ante
bellum condition when- drunkenness
among the lower classes ot society
presented a most serious problem.-JL
is" a well-establishment fact that- eacn
one of the sixty odd holidays, irre
spective of Sundays, when business
houses and factories close their doors,'
used to mean a crippling of business
activity on the following day and of
ten for two succeeding days because
of the sprees which, attended the hoi
day celebrations. It is said that the
saving to the woridngmen in this re
spect alone runs into prodigious fig

CHARLESTON, W. Va? June 21.?
Startling Irregularities In the count
lot of billots Indicating fraud by elec
tion officers In Raleigh county, Itae
borne of General A. A. Lily, which
were brought to light yesterday In
the progress of a recount, Increased
Judge Robinson's vote In the county
to.144;*Thirteen precincts remain to
be finished on the recount and these
will be completed today:'vV
Yesterday's developbents boosted
Judge Roblnsln's majority to G64 on
the face of returns, according to Rob
inson headquarters, counting the re
counts finished yesterday In Harrison.
Pocahontas and Clay counties.
In the recount at Hockley, It was
shown that the vote on the governor
ship at Dorothy precinct had been
counted 92-for Lilly and 52 for Rob
inson, while the recount showed Judge
Robinson had actually carred the pre
clnct by a T0tc of 73 to 72. At Mc
Alpine precinct there was a gala of
92 votes shown for Robinson on tho
same baslsT
Tbe county court of Raleigh county,
which Is friendly to Mr. Lilly, immedi
ately ordered'the change made, in the
returns," there being no question to
the verity of tbe ballots. Charges were
mgde in some quarters that a whole
sale effort had been made to change
the returns Jn order to Increase Lilly's
;.Uqrl?7.im hli ham* county.
. The news from Beckley has created
a sensation. Raleigh Is the only coun
ty .whsre the recounts showed any
thing but alight changes tar the vote
for. governor. as originally counted.
Such revelations as those specified are
not mere mistakes, but evidently pre
meditated effort/ to vitiate the ver
dict of the -voters of the county.
Only slight changes were made In
other recounts completed. In Harri
son county Judge Robinson's major
ity wu reduced from 264 to 252 and in
Pocahontas county Lilly's majority
wsWhereis**d'froml25 to lt7. In Clay

PICNIC M
[Agricultural Clubs of Tin,
coin District Had OidJ9
fashioned Outing. '
About 40 boys and girls beta
to tile Agricultural clube of L
district met at the East Run i
building Monday for a picnic to cele
brato the fifty third birthday ot our
state. Althouyh the rain came down
in torronts during the morning the
boys enjoyed themselves playing-baa
ket ban and volley ball In the old
jnchool building. A few of tie good
people of Eas t Run came In about the
noon hour, and brought with them
great basket* full of provisions. All
of the food that the boys had brought
and the food the neighbors brought
was pnt together Just like an old-time
picnic.
When the club members were called
to dinner they found an nndremed ot
feast awaiting them. One very at
tractive feature of the dlnnrfwas a
magnllcent white cake mads by Miss
Rhoda Atha. It had 63 small UnltAd
States flags grouped very artistically
around the top. When cat, it waa
found to be composed of three, layer*,
the first red, the second white and tiie
third blue. Beach boy and girl was
given a flag to wear as a auuiBslil^q
? he aftornoo n waa.spent playing base
ball, basket ball and other gsmea.
The boys thoroughly enjoyed the*e
games, and played with a* much en
thusiasm as two league teams txrald
possibly muster.
Will Attia, Mrs. George Former,
and Mlsa Rhoda Atha were the grown
up visitors who helped so materially
with the lunch and made the boy* feel
that the old time hospitality haa sot
been forgotten In some localities. The
club agent and the members of club
expr?""d their appreciation for the
assistance thes e people rendered U
making the outing such a success.
Lester Atha. local club president, did
his part by seeing that' everything
was well arranged for the picnic.
