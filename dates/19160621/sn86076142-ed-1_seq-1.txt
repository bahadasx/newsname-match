WASHINGTON', June 21. Pressure is being brought to bear on
Carranza by representatives of European powers to prevent a formal
break with the United States. Indirect reports reaching the Secre
tary of State told of these efl'orts, which are said to have a
possibility of success. Agencies of the entente allies are understood
to be active for peace, believing that Germany has sought to inflame
the Mexicans against the United States with a view fit preventing
Americans from gathering trade formerly controlled by Germans
in Mexico and South and Central America.
It is pointed out that Carranza might avoid war by calling for
an international commission to discuss the border situation, as
provided by the treaty of 1843.
There has been no suggestion from Mexico' in favor of such
steps.. ... . ..... . . .....

MUCH TRAINING
There is nothing so fair as a 4
day in June, but when a fellow
wants a friend to lend him an
overcoat It Is carrying the sum-
mer resort idea too far. Last
night the mercury dropped to 36

cause householders to chase
around after old garments to
swathe their flower gardens
which are coming back after the
severe shock of the frost of two
weeks ago. Despite the common
statement that nothing of the
kind was ever experienced be-
fore, the Weather Bureau comes
out with the gelid fact that It
was worse in 1908, when on the
third day of June thermometer
In Tonopah registered 26 de-
grees. With the wind In the

night.
