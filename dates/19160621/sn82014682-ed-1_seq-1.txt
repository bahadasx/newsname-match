Anti-Saloon League'lo Protest
Against Tavern and Late ; .
v Liquor Selling
Unexpected fireworks, specially pre
pared by the Anti-Saloon League,, will
be exploded this afternoon at v. the an
nual meeting of the Oahu Liquor Li
cense Commission. What promlaad to
be a j peaceful meeting, ahsplutely de
void of sensations, how ' . promises:
some ualooked for . developments. -
When the members are comfortably
seated at 3:30, George W. Patj, secre
tary of the Ant-Saloon League, will
request that the license for Heinle's
Tavern be not renewed. He will strike
again with a demand that special priv
ileges 10 hotels 'and cafes td sell liquor
after 11:30 p. m. be discontinued;'
"Heiaie's Tavern is operating Ille
gally," taid Paty Ails morning, "and
I intend to prove this to the commis
sion. "The place is really no more
than a :oad house and although I have
no specific complaint to make against
it, numerous objections have come to
my office from residents on WaikikI
beach and I think it should be closed."
Paty say s th a tavern 'is operated
upon a petition that does not carry
the names of a majority of property
holders and lessees within 1000 feet of
the, tavern, as required by law.
The tavern at one time might have
had sTitiicient signers on its petition,
according, to Paty, bi't many people
have moved into that vicinity since
who do not want the place there end
will object strenuously to Its continu
ance, 6ays Paty.
Accompanying Paty's request that
Heinie's be put out of business will be
a petition to that effect, signed by
about a dozen residents near. the tav
ern. Paty says he can get many more
if necessary.
Fights Special Privileges.
. The matter of special privileges to
sell after regular closing hours, Paty
says, ?s one of. the most objectionable
features of the whole liquor selling
regulation system In Honolulu and he
intends to make a strong fight against
such special privileges. . " .. ' ... : , .V
