The Wilson Campaign to Start With
a Bang
HUGHES VISITS HIS COLLEGE
Roosevelt Confers With Leaders In
cluding Dr. Jackson of Vermont
Will Speak Soon
New York, Juno 21 The Democratic
campaign will open here this week with
a bang. This announcement was
brought here yesterday by Vance Me
Cormick, the new Democratic National
Committee Chairman who is to run
President Wilson's campaign. Mr. Mc
Cormick reached this city during the
morning from Washington, where he
had conferences with President Wilson
and other leaders. With ex-Ambassador
Henry Morgenthau, Mr. McCor
mlck superintended the preparation of
the campaign headquarters on the se
cond floor of the Forty-second street
Building.
Providence, H. I., June 20.
Charles E. Hughes today kept his
promise to exclude politics from his vis
it to Providence so far as he was able
to do so. He spent much of his time
walking about the estate of Benjamin
Barker, a classmate, at Tiverton,
twenty-six miles from here, talking
over old times with twenty-eight other
alumni who were graduated at Brown
University with him in 1881. They had
a clambake and sang the old college
songs.
In the lobbies of the hotels in
Providenco, however, Mr. Hughes was
unable to prevent demonstrations in his
behalf, and members of the various
classes of Brown who gathered here
gave their college yells, always with
the name of Hughes as the final word.
Evidently Brown University in filled
with enthusiasm over the honor which
has been paid to one of its graduates.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., June 20. Saga
more Hill was the scene of another con
ference today In which Colonel Roose
velt met a number of Progressive lead
ers, the majority of whom stayed to
luncheon and spent nearly the whole
afternoon In discussion. When they
left Oyster Bay In the evening it was
felt that the decision of Colonel Roose
velt to support Hughes had been made
final.
The men who lunched with Mr
Roosevelt were George von L. Meyer,
former secretary of the Navy, who or
ganized the Roosevelt Republican com
mitteo before the Chicago covention;
Charles J. Bonaparte, former Attorney
General, who was one of the conferees
appointed by the Progressives to meet
a committee from the Republican con
vention in an effort at compromise;
Dr. H. Nelson Jackson, National Com
mltteeman for Vermont, and William
H. Dye, National Committeeman for
Indiana. William Savacool, National
Committeeman for New Hampshire,
came late in the afternoon.
It was learned on good authority last
night that a statement for publication
would be made by Colonel Roosevelt,
probably on Monday, showing a decid
edly friendly attitude toward Charles
E. Hughes, Republican nominee for
president.
While the exact nature of this state
ment could not be learned and whilo
it is not known whether the Colonel
will pledge his support to Mr. Hughes
it is expected that the statement will
augur such support.
SENTENCE COMMUTED

CHILD DIED SUDDENLY
Oldest Son of Mr. and Mrs Arthur H.
Cushman. j
The people of North Bennington
were shocked and saddened Tuesday
afternoon upon learning of the great
loss sustained by Mr. and Mrs. A. H.
Cushman, in the death of their eldest
son, Westervelt Thatcher Cushman.
Those who attended the Children's
Day exercises at the Congregational
church last Sunday morning and heard
the little lad as he so manfully took
his part in the exercise "Obey," little
thought that in a few short hours, as
it were, lie would be called upon to
obey the Master's summons and leave
his earthly tasks, ere they were
scarcely begun, but his brief alarming
illness resulting in septicenia com
plicated with septic infection of the
linging of the heart, detied the skill of
the best medical advice available in
Bennington and near by cities, and
the little life was ended in spite of all
that loving hands could do.
Westervelt was an unusual child,
kind and thoughtful beyond his years.
Theso lovable qualities attracted to
him a large circle of friends for one
so young, and he will be missed not
only in the home, but elsewhere, es
pecially in the White Co.'s shops,
where it was his custom to go about
among the workmen, always interested
in their tasks, yet never exceeding his
privileges, a little gentleman to all.
He celebrated his ninth birthday on
Dec. 30th and is survived by a younger
brother and a sister.
The funeral services, which will be
for the family and immediate friends,
will be held Thursday after
noon at 2 o'clock, from the residence
of H. C. White. Interment will be in
Grand View cemetery.
The boy was a grandson of Mr. and
Mrs. H. T. Cushman and of Mr. and
Mrs. II. C. White.
BOY SCOUTS IN CAM P

Minority Can Rule State
Of the people of Vermont tho 80,0o0
living in 139 towns have a working
majority of 32 as to lawmaking in the
Vermont house of representatives.
The 80,000 by their representatives
cun vote up or down the views of the
270,000 living in the other towns of tho
State.
Thus, taking the State as a whole
less than ono fourth of the. people who
licve in the smaller towns can easily
rule the making and repealing of the
State laws, to the extent at least of
preventing the general assembly from
enacting a single bit of legislation to
which they are not favorable.
In a land where the rule is supposed
to be of the people, by tho people and
for the people, it is not fair that one
fourth of tho people should have such
powe.
If the 276.000 people in tho State are
to como Into their own as to making
the laws of Vermont thero must bo
some change is the Stato constitution.
Each town wants to keep on having
Its personal representative in the Leg
Mature. But why not let his law
making power be In proportion to the
population of the towns which he
represents?
That would seem to be fair to all and
would place legislative power under
the control of four-fourths of tho
people of the State. Brattleboro Re

Why Young Men Leave Bennington
County.
The question of why so many of our
brightest young men leave Vermont
and help to build up the prosperity of
Boston, New York and the west, is a
vital one. No one reason will explain
it, but the huge amounts in Vermont
Savings Banks are a contributing
cause.
Vermont boast3 of her thrift, but
there is such a thing as thrilt gone to
seed. The farmer who dotes on the
money ho i3 accumulating in the sav
ings bank while his buildings go to
pieces and his farm runs out because
of lack of fertilizer; the business man
who accumulates his money at inter
est when it might be developing his
community and paying him 10 pur cent
instead of 4 per cent and the man who
puts his gold in a bag in the wall are
in the same class. Money invested in
keeping up a farm, in purchasing first
class stock, in fertilizer, will pay far
more than 4 per cent.
Vermont is loaning a great deal of
her money at a low rate of interest to
Kansas and the rest. The westerners
take the Vermonter's money, add their
brains, develop their country and
become wealthy. Hut they take more
than the money from Vermont, they
take the young men. Money in a sav
ings bank creates no opportunities for
young men in Vermont. Hut the same
money used in the west in develop
ment, creates opportunities, lies it,
few opportunities for young men in
Vermont, many in tho west.
We cannot expect our best young
men to remain in Vermont until we
say to the westerners, to the outsiders,
"We have just as many brains as you,
we can use our own money to develop
our own stato just us wisely as you
can use our money to develop your
state, and we intend to have all of the
profits ourselves.

10 EXTRlCATt
Russians Have Pushed So Far
Flank is in Danger
BOTH ARE CLAIMING VCTQIY
Austrians In Southern Bukowina are
Hard Pressed and May Have to
Surrender.
London, June 29. Simultaneously
with olllcial Austrian admission to
night that the left wing of General
Hrusiloff's army has crossed the
Sereth, driving tho Austro-llungarians
before them in the direction of the Car
pathians, came a statemtnt by the Ger
man war olllce announcing that the
Teutons have broken the resistance
of the Russian center and are "light
ing their way forward."
Tonight's otlicial Russian report be
gins with the statement that "the ene
my is furiosly counter attacking Gen
eral Brussiloff's armies."
Thus the day's otlicial news from the
eastern theatre indicates that General
von Llnsingen, who commands the Aus-
tro-Ueruian forces in Volhynia, lias be
gun the great anking movement de
signed to sweep the Rusian center
back beyond LuUk and Dubno and then
envelop Brussiloff's Bukowina and Ca
licia armies.
The crossing of the Sereth, lengthen
ing as it does the Russian lines of
communication still further, is believed
to add tmthe sudden peril in which the
Russian right wing finds itself, now
that the thrust against Kovel, the
commanding railway intersection, ap
parently has failed. '
mo next twenty-four hours are
looked for by military critics to decide
whether the Russian offensive has suf
ficient driving power to beat back the
lemons in oinynia ueyonu kovci, or
whether German strategy and rein
forcement have once more saved the
Austrians from a-declslvc defeat.
I.ondon.June 20. Three German at
tacks were made la.tt night on the
French positions northwest of Hill, No.

How To Get Well
A good rule to securo health Is to
avoid reading the health hints printed
in the newspapers, which set you to
thinking you have every possible dis
ease." White River Junction Land
mark.
This is the best health hint that has
been published in a long long time.
The human mind is a curious thing
aiid when It Is led upon symptoms
of various kinds of sickness, the aver
age individual Is pretty certain to de
velop some kind of an ailing that
needs attention.
It is on this that many patent
medicine mukers depend in their ad
vertlsing "literature." They enumer
ate svmptoins which each anil
every individual is vciy likely to have
even when enjoying good health, and
the mind, picking up the suggestions,
begins to get In its curious work.
It is true that sickness, or health.
is in large measure a state of mind
Persons whose bodies, by every test
known to medicrl science, are sound
and healthy, can be perfectly miser
able through the power of suggestion
and continued dwelling on their fun
cled ills.
Take nn average man. He thinks
he has heart trouble, kidney disease
and so many other things that ho Is
on the point of picking out the hymns
he wants sung at his funeral. He
hesitates to go to n doctor because
while he is convinced that he la in the
last throes of dissolution, he never
theless dreads to hear the worst.
Then one day he gets up his cour-
nge, makes nn appointment with his
doctor and for an hour the medicine
ninn tinkers nround him. Jabbing here
and tapping there to find nothing, ab
solutely nothing, wrong with the pa
tient. Then the man who enter ml the
physician's office with a face as Ion
as an undertaker's, Ktops forth into
the sunlight bright and happy with
enough elastic In his walk to stretch
from hero to the Pacific coast.
He is perfectly well once again. And
why? Just because ho has had the
bosh knocked out of his head by a
man who knows and In whom the pa
Hint has confidence. The Messenger
Is not running a free ad for the doc
tors in Its editorial columns, nnd it
knows that doctors are expensive, but
the next time you have hardening of
the arteries or Blight's disease after
reading an almanac, don't lose your
grip, but If your confidence in your
state of health Is shaken, call upon
the M. P. and get a new lease of life.

REINF0RCEMENTSION THE ROAD
Carranza's Total Army Said to Be
100,000 Facing Funston's Less
Than 40,000
Columbus, N. M., June 20. Carranza
troops and soldiers of General Persh
ing's expeditionary command south of
Naniiquiqa are on the verge of hostili
ties, according to reports from the
field tonight.
A wireless dispatch from Colonel D.
C. Cabell, General Pershing's chief of
staff, said that the attitude of the Car-
ranza soldiers was such that Ameri
can motor truck supply trains are in
dange.v
The Mexicans are said to have
mounted artillery In positions menac
ing the Americans, and dispatches in
dicated that with the two commands
in close proximity the danger of a
clash is increasing.
San Antonio, Tex., Juno 20. Facing
Carranza's army in Northern Mexico
there will be stationed along the Rio
Grande within a week or ten days, an
nierican force that will total almost
70,000 it was stated today.
Genet al Frederick Funston has re
quested the war department to send
him a large part of the national guards
men as quickly as possible, and ad
vices received late today indicated
that entraining of the first troops
would begin tomorrow.
As fast as they arrive in the south
they will be sent to the stations
chosen. A strong reserve will be
brought to San Antonio and held here
as a reesrve, but many will be within
sight of Mexico when they get off the
trains.
General Funston did not announce
how many men he has asked, nor the
stations to which they will be sent, but
it is known he expects more than a
division and it was said not less than
28,000 men would bo sent at once.
Already the border army, made up
of regular troops and the militiamen
of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona,
comprises more than 4'M)00.
General Funston's request for the
guardsmen was for "a number suffici
ent to give adequate protection to the
border."
Reports believed to he reliable,
reached here today that J. R. Silliman,
American consul at Saltillo, was on
his way to tho border.
The best estimates obtainable, indi
cate that Carranza's army on the bor
der now is about 100,000.
MEANING OF IRISH NAMES
Changes Have Come in Spelling Since
Early Times.
The fact is not generally known that
Ireland was the first country in mod
ern Europe to enforce the adoption of
surnames by law. The act prescribing
their general use was passed more
than n hundred years before the Anglo-
Norman invasion, whereas surnames
did not come Into general uso In Eng
land until the days of Queen Elizabeth,
nor in Wales till late In the 17th ecu
tury.
1 here are some Interesting mean
ings attaching to the most common of
Irish names. Here are a few, says Tit
Bits, w ith the curious changes of spell
ing thnt have come about since the
names first originated.
Murphy came from O'Murphy, Mer
hey nnd Morphew, meaning "super
lor;" Kelly came from O'Kelly, Kiely
Kecley, meaning "for war," O Connor
from Connors, Conerty, meaning "help
er." and Dougherty from O'Dohcrty,
Doherty. Daughaday, meaning "de
stroyer." It is noticeable that all
Irish names at the first stage in their
history had "O' " before them, the first
change consisting of dropping that
OV'lt will not be necessary, there
fore, to repeat the name with the "O
before it.
Sullivan was originally Silllfant and
Sulllvant, meaning "qiuck sighted;
O'Donnell and McDonnell and all com
blnatlons of that name were Donald,
Daniel, Dona, meaning "dark chief
Molonty was O'Mullownoy, Moloney,
Mullany, meaning "thoughtful;" Mc
Connack was O'Cormac, McCormac,

ENLIST FOR U. S. ARMY
Greeks, Italians and Others Anxious to
Go to Front.
Springfield, June 20 Applicants of
all nationalities offered to enlist in the
regular army at the recruiting station
at 17 Hampden street yesterday as a
result ct the calling out of the militia
for duty on the Mexican border. Most
of the men desired to serve only dur
ing the Hostilities. These were re
ferred to tho officers in charge of the
recruiting at the armory, as the law
compels men enlisting in the regular
army to serve the full term unless
disabled or unless they buy their dis
charge. An unusually large number
of men applied at tla office and most
of them said they had been stirred
to action on account of the fact that
the militia was to serve.
A noticeable fact was the number
of Greek and Italian applicants who
seemed anxious to go to the front for
their adopted land. The greater num
ber were ot foreign birth. Several
men were accepted, ono of them being
Charles H. Foerster of Holyoke, who
enlisted in the engineer corps and
was sent to Fort Slocum, N. Y. In
terest in the army has increased dur
ing the past few days since word was
received that the Mexican situation
appeared threatening.
Prohibition and Prosperity In Russia
Figures designed to show tho new
prosperity which prohibition has
brought to Russia would be consider
ably more convincing If they were less
Impressive. The czar's ukase had
hardly had time to go Into effect be
fore Lloyd-George, working for pro
hibition in England, was declaring
that Russian efficiency had been In
creased 40 per cent. Then Russia
slumped and the beer-drinking Teu
tons went on from ictory to victory
ow that the czars armies are onco
more triumphantly advancing, we get
new statistics of Russian prosperity,
even more imposing than the first.
That the wealth of tho peasant com
inunittes lias ncen increased b; per
cent is tho claim of Ivan Xarodny,
secretary of the Russian-American-
Asiatic corporation. While in the
other belligerent countries an in
crease in lawbreaking has been do
plored, in Russia criminality has do-
creased 38 per cent. More remark
able still, general welfare, whatever
that may mean, has increased 90 per
cent. What Index he uses to get so
mathematical a result is not stated.
It Is a pity to compromise so good
a cause as that of temperance with
figures that provoke suspicion. That
vodka was doing great harm to Bus
sia and that reform was urgently
needed Is generally admitted. Hut
that two years of disastrous warfare
In which It has lost its richest and
most populous ttrrltorles nnd millions
of men and has been forced to bor
row till the purso strings of its allies
cracked, that two such years should
have diffused the radiance of prosper
ity over the somber empire of the
north Is a good deal to ask us to be
lieve. Springfield Republican.

GOVERNOR MAKES STATEMENT
General Assembly Was Called To
gether In 1898 at Outbreak of
War With Spain.
Montpelier, June 20. While the
military department of Vermont has
bent every effort for the past 48 hours
to put the state troops in readiness for
mobilization at Fort Ethan Allen
Thursday, the executive department
has concerned itself with the possiblo
necessity of making provision tor as
sisting the families and dependents of
enlisted men and tonight there seems
every reason to believe that Gov. Char
les W. Gates will find it necessary to
convene the General Assembly In ex
traordinary session as was done at
the opening of the Spanish-American
wa.
Adjutant Gen. Lee S. TillO'son. of
St. Albans has been in conference with
Gov. Gates regarding the necessity of
providing aid for such of Vermont mil
itia as may be mustered into the fed
eral service. At the close of the con
ference at midnight the secretary of
civil and military affairs, Maj. Benja
min Gates, gave out . the following
statement from Gov. Gates:
I shall call a special session of
the Legislature just as soon as it
appears that the state troops are to
be held in federal service any length
of time. War has not been declared
and the nature and length of service
of our state troops has not been suffi
ciently determined to justify the ex
pense and trouble of a special session
immediately. I do wish to say, how
ever, that if the present situation is
prolonged in any degree that the state
should provide for additional pay for
enlisted men and for any exigencies
that may arise.
The state should also amply pro
vide for the families and dependents of
