Rio Grande within a week or ten
days an American force that will
total, it was believed today, al
most, seventy thousand men. Gen
eral Funston lias requested the
war department to send him lis
quickly as possible a large part
of the national guardsmen mid
advices received late today in
dicated that entraining of the
first troops would be begun to
morrow. As fast as they arrive
in the south they will be sent to
the stations chosen. A part wiH
be brought to San Antonio and

General Funston did not an
nounce how many he lias asked
for nor the stations to which
they would be sent, but it is
known that he expects more than
a division and it was said that
nut less than twenty-eight thou
sand would be sent.

the international line is prepared
to resist any aggression the
Mexican government forces
might make, but it was demon
strated some time ago that it
was not big enough to guard j
the long line from Brownsville 1
to the Pacific, and army officers
never bave regarded it as strong!
enough to undertake an invasion
in force. General Funston 's re
quest for the guardsmen was for
a number sufficient to give ade
quate protection to the border.
Officers at his headquarters nlso
Telt that with this increased force
operations in Mexico on a big
scale might be undertaken, but
in the event of intervention or
any other action making neies

immediately for the remainder of

Moliillnlliiii Continues.
Mobilization of the national guards
men Is proceeding expeditiously In all
states and plans for sending some of
them southward in response to a re
quest from Oeneral Funston are un
der way. Secretary Ionising today de
scribed the policy of the government
as being founded only on a resolve to
protect the border. That policy has
not been changed, he said, and lo.
military step that has been taken ha.-,
any other oblect. Oeneral Carranza
was officially informed of Oils In the
note which went forward today.
To carry out his share In the policy
Oeneral l-'unston sent a long code dis
patch to Secretary linker today In
dicating what portion of the one hun
dred thousand guardsmen ordered un
der arms he needs Immediately to
stiffen bis border guard. The points
at which he wishes the men mobilized
and the proportions of Inf intrv, cav
alry and nrtlllery to have at each
plaep were included
Assignment will be made from the
first state units to b" mustered Into
the service. rreliminary arrange
ments were discussed today with rail
road officials looking to their prompt
transportation to the points selected
by Oeneral Funston.
None Roddy Now.
None of the guardsmen summoned
under President Wilson's call were
ready tonight for marching orders.
It may tie a matter of several days
before Ihe first regiments are mus
tered In. as the men will have to be
examined physically, additional camp
equipment assembled for them and
th trains to carry them to the bor
der arranged for.
Seveiul states also are expected to
complete their mobilization by to
morrow night and a decision may
then be reached as to which forces
will be mfcved first. There was not
suff'cient Information available to
night, however, to furnish an esti
mate as to how much time would be
required to get the entire force ready
for active service.
