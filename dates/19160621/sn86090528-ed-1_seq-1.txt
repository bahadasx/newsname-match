Mcliow, William Uoinhelmor. I.ouis
Krlich, V. V Durncll, J. W. Kayser.
William Ueinlieimer, who has serv
ed the association for the past year
as its president, was plsu'oil in nomi
nation for re-electron, but refused to
servo another year, stating that he
felt some other member of Hie asso
ciation should have that honor.
1 W. Darnell, the outgoing treasur
er of the association, also declined a
re-election, assigning (he same rea
sons for so doing as those given by
Mr. Reiutieliucr.
Owing to the fuct that last night
was the regular unnual election ineet
ii'g a larger attendance Was present
thin has been for some time, the sec
retary's books jihowlng that thirteen
members and officers were present.
Mr. Iteinhelmer, in. declining the
nomination for a second term' address
ed a few pertinent and well directed
remarks in w hich 'he outlined the du
ties of members of the association.
He told in plain language of the good
which could he accomplished through
the motnborshlp getting together and
working in harmony; he spoke of the
manner in which the. city could bo
built through the concentrated efforts
of all business men working not as in
dividuals, but as a unit; he stated that
only the "pull-together" spirit could
make possible the "get-there" spirit
and said that the time had come when
all business . men should forget the
cross roads periods of their business
lives and ' realise that tuny were now
doing business ill a modern city and
umi. ii wag ineieioie jin;siu v lor
them to become modern merchants,
imbued with modern ideas and work-
nig along nroailer lines. .
Mr. Bynum, who re'-eutl.v bought the
Atwood C. 'O. 1). store, and who has
taken an active interest In-the associ
ation since coming to Chickasha, also j
spoke. He' stated that the merchants- I
association could do more than could
anything else to bring about a bustle
and boom and make a, city of Chick
asha. He urged all members of the
association to work in harmony, to
turn out to the monthly meetings and
to even do better still and arrange for
weekly meetings.
President Hitsche brought up the
matter of the proposed Fourth of
July celebration and asked whether or
not the Merchants' association was
behind the' proposition. He stated
that a divergence of opinion was daiiy
impressed ili this matter and said that
he felt the general public would like
to kiiow r ' .
Mr. Ueinlieimer stated that at the
last meeting there was not a quorum
of members present, therefore nothing
could be officially done. However, he
said at that meeting it seemed to be
the concensus of opinion of all pres
ent that a celebration should be held
In Chickasha on the fourtn of July and
that any action' taken should be taken
on account of the feeling of tin; ones
present.
Mr. Schwartz" stated that bo was
present at the meeting; that there
was not a quorum present; that he
had gathered, the sentiment of those
present to mean that they were will
ing to have Hie celebration in event
the majority of the business men fa
vored it; that-he had hustled out
among tho business men and "passed!
the hat;" that he hud met with little
or no opposition in the matter; that'
he had ucted for the best us ho had
seen and understood matters; that he
proposed to donate a part of tho net
proceeds to the building of the boule
vard known as Seventeenth street and
to tho installation of concrete light
poles along that thoroughfare, as well
as to putting In drainage culverts at
places along the boulevard where
needed.
it was finally decided that while no
record of anything appeared upon the
books of tlie association, for the rea
son of lack of quorum and no meeting,
it should be the will of those present
that Mr. Schwartz cimtinue promo
tion of the proposed celebration, a part
of the proceeds to be turned over, or
to be used in improving the boulevard
leading to the Women's college.
The matter of closing all places of
business on July 4th was taken up
and some discussion ensued. It was
stated that members of the clerk's
union would not consent to a part hol
iday but wanted tho stores closed for
the entire day. It was finally decided
that petitions should be circulated for
the purpose of ascertaining the senti
ments of all and that the majority rule
should apply.
The celebration matter being again
called up it was decided that as the
opinion had gained currency, and the
Impression gone forth that the asso
ciation was behind the same there
should be no effort made to block tho
plans, that it might be of benefit to
ail business "men of the .city and that
the formerly expressed opinion of the
maimer in which and by whom it
should be managed should prevail
Nothing, however, coining to a vote.

C. Hutson, Delegate to Democratic
Gathering, Says Harmony in Con
vention Was Complete; Finds
No Hyphenate Defection
HIGH COMMENDATION
Declares Tom Wade is Taking Prominent
Place in Arena of National Politics;
Owen and Ferris in
Limelight
L. C. Hutson returned to Chickasha
yesterday from St. Louis, where he
went as a delegate to the National
Democratic convention. Following
tlie convention's adjournment Mr
Hutson stopped off a couple of days
at Jefferson City, visiting his old
home.
In speaking of the convention which
nominated the standard bearers of
tho Democratic party, Mr. Hutson
said that it was acknowledged by all
to liave been the most harmonious
political gathering of its kind this
country has known. There was no
friction anywhere, or at any time
jivcry ueieRute was a Wilson man
and every delegate was for Mr. Wll
son s principles and for the party
platform as it was brought forward.
Throughout the section lie visited,
Mr. Hutson said, lie could find none
of tho bitterness said to exist in the
ranks of. the so-called "hyphenated,'
citizenry. Missouri, Mr. Hutson stat
ed, is. a state with a heavy "Gorman
American" vote, while St. Louis,
the convention city, is known to be
second city in the United States in
point of German descended citizens
In the city of St. Louis, and the state
at large, Mr. Hutson said he could
note no hostile attitude toward Mr
Wilson's policies in so far as those of
German birth or of German descent
were concerned.
The majority of the so-called German-American
vote of the country
has always been Republican, Mr. Hut
son Stated, and as far as he saw
things tho vote with that class of cit
izens this fall will be as it bus always
been along strict party lines, the
Republican German-American voting
for Hughes, the Democrat Gerinan
Americun voting for Wilson, both
Democrats and Republicans of that
class being loyal and patriotic Amer
icans. Mr. Hutson spoke in the highest
terms of Tom Wade as a national
committeeman. He said that through
Mr. Wade's efforts not only every Ok
lahoma delegate was cared for, but
also every convention visitor from
Oklahoma.
Through someone's blunder a dou
ble delegation bad been returned
from Oklahoma and through the well
directed and diplomatic efforts of Mr.
Wade, seats were secured for every
one of those, notwithstanding the fact
that the rules especially barred any
sui h thing as a "double delegation."
Mr. Hutson also said that Mr. Wade
was looked upon by all other mem
bers of tlie national committee as be
ing a leader in his party; that he is
recognized as a man of ability in the
political arena.
lu speaking of other distinguished
Oklahonians who were present at the
convention, Mr. Hutson said that
United States Senator Kobert L. Owen
was recognized by all as one of the
strong men, not only of the Democrat
ic party, but of the country at large.
"He is recognized as a statesman
and a leader; as a man of strict integ
rity of character and of irreproacha
ble party fealty," said Mr. Hutson.
Congressman Scott Ferris, also, he
said, was recognized as one of the
strong men of national politics. Fer
ris demonstrated at tlie convention
'.that he has the broadest national ac
quaintance of any member of con
gress, no matter from what state.
And, Mr. Hutson said, this aequain-
J C..VC. !i not a superficial one, it is
ft'ith the ones worth while who recog
nize him as being one of them.
When asked bis individual opinion
of the result of the comng elm lion.

Berlin, Juno 21. The advocates of

Fuci'iV thia fact, they are united In
the desire to see the war pushed with

do to change Ainoricun opinion will
help us to win the war and we should
