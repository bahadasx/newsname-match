MASON COUNTY
JURNPIKES
Mr. Y, Hollon Key Makes Inlerestlnff
Statement Concerning County
HnndN After Making Itispec
(Ion Tour Lnrgo Num
ber of Turnpike In
llnd Condition.
Tho writer of this nrtlclc has al
ways been Interested In tho public
wolfnro of Mayavllc and Mason Coun
ty nnd tho continued golna down of
our turnpikes has become so Increased
that I do not feci as n public spirited
citizen nnd ns a tax pnycr that same
should go unnoticed by mo ns well ns
ovcry tax payer and citizen In Mason
County. I, therefore, have taken It
upon myBolf to go Into the records to
sco what I can find pertaining to Ma
son County's turnpikes. I find no
public record of tho number of miles
of Mnson County's turnpikes system,
nnd, I, therefore, set to work making
a list of nil the turnpikes In Mason
County, nnd after putting down my
Ideas: as to tho length of each turn
pike, 1 hnvo commenced tho measure
ment of every macadam road In the
County, nnd In tho various articles
which I propose to glvo tho public, I
am going to report tho condition of
the roads ns I measure same.
In Juno Gth, I took tho Washington
& Murphysvlllo pike, leading from
Washington to Ncedmorc. This road
for most of its length has n splendid
bed-rock nnd for tho most part of same
this bed-rock Is showing up, In other
words, tho rains hnvo washed tho fine
macadam and exposed this bed-rock
The drainage on this pike is very poor
the wntcr running for n great deal of
Its whole length In the middle of the
turnpike Instead of In tho gutters.
Thero Is quite n lot of rock being haul
ed to be applied to this road sometime
this year. I would say, there Is more
work going on this road, this spring.
than any three roads I have been over
There Is being somo good ditching
done but It Is of a class that is expen
sive. Thero is ! 2-10 miles of this
pike.
After leaving Washington & Mur
physvllle pike, I proceeded over the
Sardls & Maysllck piko from Xeed
more. Tho first mile nnd ono-half
from Ncedmorc has had some very
good work during tho last 18 months,
but from tho Absolom pike to the home
of Alfred I'ecd, the road is getting In
a horrible condition from the lack of
work. Since 1912, there has been one
string of rock, that I know of. put on
this pike between tho last named
points, which is a distanco or protia
bly 1 miles. Tho water continues
to run in the mlddlo of this turnpike
and, therefore, depreciating It much
faster than It otherwise would. At the
lane leading to Ben Hawkins fnrm,
thero is a hole In the road 6 feet ui
diameter, that during tho past winter
became so bad that It was almost 1m
possible for trafllc to get by, this hole
remains and probably ono load of rock
would fix It so that It would never
again give trouble. Thero Is one
small bridgo on this road between the
Manlcy and Allison farms, that has
been covered with 3 Inches of dirt nnd
mud for tho last three years and can
not bo seen If It were not for the ends
of the bridge sticking out. At tho bot
tom of each hill on this pike, which Is
rather n steep one, thero aro very
large and deep mud holes which could
be fixed for a very small amount of
money. Thero is talk In this com
munlty, of tho citizens giving enough
of their time, to haul rock to fix the
worst parts of the road. There aro
threo splendid concrete bridges that
havo been put in on this road In the
last four years, thereby eliminating
any more bridgo troubles on this plka
This piko is 4 9-10 miles in length.
On Juno 12th, I took tho Sardls road
where it comes on to tho Lexington
pike, near Henjamln Longnccker'a.
This piko Is in fnlrly good condition
for tho first G-10 of a mile, or to Mur-
physvllle's Precinct line, west of the
first bridge. From that point to Need
more, this pike Is tho worst plcco of
road, I bollevo, in Mason County. Tho
water runs down the center of the
pike, thero being no effort, whatever,
to carry same off Into the gutters. This
piko needs more rock than any pike
I havo seen in tho County, and unlets
something Is dona with It during the
next four months, Maysvlllo will be
cut off from Robertson County during
the next Tobacco Season, in Maysvllle,
unless tho Murphysville & Washington
Turnpike holds up sufficiently to take
caro of tho traffic. Thero is somo rock
being put on this road but it Is Bucb
negligible quantity, that It will hardly
do much good. Thero was only ono
plcco of this road put In good condi
tion, last year, from tho homo of John
Mnley to tho gate-way of J. C. Jeffer
son's. According to last year's roport.
there was qulto a sum of monoy put on
this pike but tho point of above Is the
only point between tho Lexington pike
and Necdmore that show it. In somo
places, that tho ditches have filled up
so much In tho last five years, that the
earth is from 4 to 6 inches on top of
tho piko. At tho junction of tho dirt
lano leading from Maysllck through
to tho Shannon neighborhood, it seems
thoro has been a creek running down
tho mlddlo of the piko and has washed
away moro macadam than $100.00 can
roplaco. Thero Is only ono bridgo In
this stretch of pike of 4 8-10 miles:
that Is lu first class condition. I have
been no further than Ncodmoro on
this pike. My report of tho balance
of It will appear In another Issue
Opposite Joo Manloy a farm, I took
tho Absolm piko, which leads across
to the Lexington pike. There uro
2-10 miles of this and thoro aro 4
bridges In that distanco, Thoro was
79.60 spent on this road In 1915, most
of which coiiBUt of rock hauled ou the
road which havo never bocu knapped,
and, consequently, remain ou tho side
of tho road. Tarts of this road aro so
'ough that it Is almost Impassable Thf
tains and tho water running down tho
middle of the road havo been tho en
tire cauno of the macadam getting off,
as thoro has novor been sufficient
travel upon it to wear out any part ot
