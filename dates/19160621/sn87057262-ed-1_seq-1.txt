GREATLY INTERESTED

tBy Charles P. Stewart, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BUBNOS AYRES, June 21.—All
South America today focused its at*
tention on the Mexican-American
crisis, awaiting eagerly General Car
ranza's next move In reply to the
American note.
The Latin-American association ls
susd a call for a mass meeting of pro
test against American oocupation of
Mexican territory. The call for the
meeting mentioned the "intervention
ist tendencies of the United States
southward." vaguely hinting that in
terventionlsts in the United States
dMskff-fthreatened the safety of the other
Latin-American republics.
The Argentine papers are divided
in their sympathies. LaNacion, the
most influential newspaper in Argen
tine, attributes Mexico's present plight
to outlawry which Carransa is evi
dently Impotent to prevent. While
practloally admitting the existence of
a strong nucleus of sympathy in
South America for Mexico, LaNaoion
adds:
"But the attitude of the United
States deserves a tranquil view as
long as it malntalna a guarantee of
Mexican territorial Integrity."
The newspaper Razon, publishes a
review of the situation under the
headline "Mexico's Calvary."
The Union suggests that possibly
other nations may be interested, men
tioning no names, but evidently mean
ing Japan. The newspaper Argentina
says that Mexico Is simply suffering
the consequences of anarchy.

NOT YET ORDERED TO THE BORDER
[By I W. Aokerman, United Preas

B1 IN, June 21^~Taklng advan
tage S"t a growing Indifference to
Am opinion, advocates of a
str submarine policy have reopen
ed a campaign for a more effective
u« it the German boats.
ne German people now realize that
hoatllltlea will not end this summer
and may drag Into next year. Faced
with this faot, they are united In the
desire to see the war pushed with
the utmost vigor until the allies ars
brought to terms. This feeling,
spreading gradually throughout the
empire during the past few weeks,
has. been selaed upon as a weapon bv
the men who condemned Chancellor
Von Bethmann-Hollweg fcr yielding
to the United States In the recent
submarine controversy.
The chanoellor at the present mo
ment has the upper hsnd. But the
recent slackening of the press oin
sorshlp has been followed by some
bold statements regarding the effec
tiveness of the eubmarlne weapon
which Germany etlll possesses and bv
renewed activity on the part of the
navy league. It la Impossible to fore
cast what the result will be If re
gard for American opinion give way
more and more to the determination
for aggressive measures to bring the
war to a victorious end.
Europe's unfriendly reception of
President Wilson's peace talk before
the League to Enforce Peace, perhapa
caused Interest In Germany to veer
away from America. At any rate It
Is held here that the president's
failure to obtain a response has not
added to his Inuflence.
During recent conversations with
public men, I have noted a general
change In'their attitude toward Amer
ica. Summed up, the German view
right now le about this:
"Sixty percent of Americans are
against us. Thirty percent are for
us. Ten percent are Indifferent. Noth
ing we can do will change American
opinion In a way that will help us
win the war. We ahould go ahead
then, concentrating all our energy on
victory."-
The mflltary and economlo situation
convince the Germans that they have
nothing to fear from a continuance of
the fighting. An admission In an
article In the London Mall that the
British food blockade cannot force
Germany to terms has teen widely
read here. In view of the recent eight
days of rain, followed by ideal weath
er for orops, the German people are
convinced that they oannot be starved
out
The Russian offensive hasn't dis
turbed the public mind. The Cologne
Gazette declares that the Russians
not only have b«en halted, but that
a successful German counter move Is
already under way. The Russians, the
Gazette says, have failed In their
prime object to win Roumanla to the
side of the allies, as is evidenced by
the fact that the Roumanian queen
Is soon to visit Berlin.
The Lokal Anzelger emphasized an
other phase of the situation today.
Referring to the English losses In the
8hakerack engagement to the French
losses at Verdun and the Italian
losses In the Trentlno, the Lokal An
zelger declared the allies were using
magnifying glasses to convert defeats
Into seeming victories. The article
concluded with the ststement that
since the allies fall to realize they
are beaten, there Is only one thing
for Germany to do—fight the war to
a finish.
REPULSING THE RUSSIANS.

of the progressive votes at the next
election, democratic leaders today
claimed.
Following conferences at the white

said that within the next week, some
of the foremost bull mooserB of the
country are going to declare them
selves, not for the democratic party,
ibut for President Wilson on his wel

In naming his campaign oommlttee,
the president is paying most atten

own party and these are expected to
further duplicate the plan to capture
progressive votes.
It seems likely Henry Morgenthau,
former ambassador to Turkey, will be
chairman of the campaign committee.

were Norman Hapgood, chairman of
the Wilson Independent league and

Carranza Near* the End.
[By J. P. Yoder, United PreSB Staff
Correspondent.!
WASHINGTON, June 21.—The Car
ransa government is nearing its end,
a high administration official said
today. The machinery is crnmbllng
and only an unexpected, right about
face in Carranza's method can pre
vent the government's complete dis
integration. this official declared,
even long enough for It to be replace^
by a government strong enough to
prevent near anarchy in the southern
republic. Such a situation has been
prophesied for months by some war
and state officials. Because the ad
ministration has repeatedly announc
ed publicly and has Insisted on giv
ing the Carranza government every
chance to restore Mexico to a real
status among nations, such official
prophets were given scant hearing.
In some instances, administration of
ficials declared prophesies unconfirm
ed by official reports, saying settled
conditions exist only in certain locali
ties. "Watchful waiting" has run Its
course, it is thought in some channels.
Officials, pointed to the not« sent Car
ranza that President Wilson and Sec
retary Lansing are finally convinced
that some other man than Carransa
and that some other government than
the present defacto structure Is need
ed to bring Mexico out of her ten
year period of revolution, rebellion
I and interclne strife.
No better evidence of this attitude
of the administration could be found
today than the statement of the high
administration official mentioned who
said: "This government still hopes
for peaceful settlement of the Mexi
can situation. We are far removed
from war or intervention. But even
if it should become necessary through
some overt act of Carranza or his
armed forces, for the punitive expedi
