PLAIN LIAR CAUGHT WITH THE GOODS
IX7HEN Congressman William E. Humphrey of Seattle got up in the house of rep
resentatives the other day and brazenly denied he had anything to do with the
purchase of the "duck-pond" postoffice, he lied!
Twitted by his colleagues in the house, Humphrey was probably angry enough
to swear that black was white.
But facts are facts, and when Humphrey declared he knew nothing of the Seat
tle postoffice deal, by which Uncle Sam got a lake for $169,500 instead of a post
office site, he deliberately lied and he knows he lied— and his personal political
organs knew he lied when they printed his statement.
On August 21, 1911, Congressman Humphrey wrote a letter and signed it. It was ad
dressed to the treasury department, to the then assistant secretary of the treasury, who was
a personal friend of Humphrey's. It was marked "Confidential."

In this letter Humphrey urged that the price asked for the postoffice site was reason
able. He wrote further that he wanted "to see the matter go forward without delay, as /
told you in our conversation."
That was I lumphrcy's last letter on the subject before the "duck pond" was bought. As
early as October 12, 1910, Humphrey wrote a letter to the treasury department "concerning
ugly rumors that were afloat" about the postoffice site. Ile asked that the matter be held
in abeyance until he could see the officials personally, lie had "some things to say which
he could not write about," he said in that letter.
