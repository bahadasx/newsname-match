Wjb believe that the flag will prove

what it will and create a reverence
not only for the flag, but for that which

MONUMENT FOR
CRAWFORD CO.
Crawford county is to have a monu
nif\nt to cost iu tiie neighborhood of
$10,000 in memory of tiie veterans of
the civil war. This was decided upon
at a meeting of the board of supervis
ors held last Saturday at tiie court
house. Under tiie new law the board
of supervisors in each county in the
sfate are allowed to levy one mill for
the purpose of erecting a monument
and for the relief of surviving old sol
diers in the county.
A special committee of business men
appointed by the president of the Com
niercial club,- together with members
of the Grand Army of the Republic,
took the matter up with the board of
supervisors last week. With a levy of
1 mill there would be over $12,000
for this fund and after taking care of
the needs of, the old veterans there
would be left in the neighborhood of
,$10,0Q0 with which to erect a monu
ment. The board took kindly to the
proposition and will look the mattter
VP fully with a view of making the
levy this fall.
Several counties in the state have
already erected monuments such as is
proposed in this county. It is thought
that $10,000 will erect a line monument
and one that every citizen in the coun
ty would bo proud of. It is believed

that tlie monument will be erected at
the southeast corner of the court house

Twenty crates, containing 500
pigeons, were shipped to Denison by
express last week from Chicago and
liberated at the Northwestern passen
ger station at 5 o'clock Saturday morn
ing by Mr. Alberts, who accompanied
the shipment to Denison. The pigeons
belonged to Chicago people, who each
year ship them to points along the
Northwestern railway and they are
permitted to. fly back to their nests in
Chicago, where the time of arrival is
checked. Mr. H. A. Carpenter, local
express agent, received a letter this
morning from Chicago stating that the
first bird readied Chicago at 1:29 p,
m. Saturday, which made the distance
to that city from Denison at the rate
of 50 miles per hour. Nearly all of the
birds readied Chicago Saturday or
Sunday although there are still a few
which have not returned. On next
Saturday, July 1st, the birds will be
shipped to Norfolk, Neb.

meet his wife and to visit his friends
and neighbors for a day or two and
happened to be here on the occurrence
of the event of unveiling the flag. Mr.
Shaw donated the flag to the Commer
cial club of Denison some time ago to
be turned over to the city and placed
upon the court house.
Hugo Gebert, chairman of the com
mittee on entertainment of the Com
mercial club, presided at the meeting
instrumental music was furnished by
the Denison. band and also the Chase
l«ipter band and the crowd sang
"America."
After the music Mr, Shaw was intro
duced and delivered an interesting ad
dress in which he pointed out what
the flag stands for and the duties and
obligations of all good Americans to
defend it. He had no criticism for cit
istens of the United States, born un
der other flags, becausc they cherished
a sentiment for the fatherland, but he
made it plain that when a man once
becomes a citizen of the United States
his allegiance is altogether in favor
of the stars and stripes. This senti
ment was heartily cheered by the
thousands of listeners who wore pres
ent on the occasion. The address of
Mr. Shaw was well received and heart
ily appreciated.

We regret to say that Dr. B. F. Phil
brook has decided to remove from
Denison to Sioux City. The reasons
for this move on the part of the doctor
are purely professional. He lias been
for some time engaged in a special
line of work at Sioux City and now
has decided to give his entire time and
attention to this work which will re
quire his becoming a resident of that
place. Tho Philbrook family have
been so prominent in a social way in
"Denison for many years that in their
going away they will be greatly missed
Wo understand the iplan is forthe
doctor to close out his business here
about the middle of July and that he
will immediately carry out his pur
poses to remove to Sioux City to take
up the new lino of work. Mrs. Phil
brook may remain in Denison-, for a
short time after the doctor goes away.
The Review wishes them., every suc
cess in the new field of venture.
R. H. Blombcrg, of Dayton, Iowa,
has purchased the fixtures and busi
ness of Dr. Philbrook and will estab
lish himself here about the middle of
(July and will succeed to the business
which Dr. Philbrook will be able to
turn over to liitn. Dr. Blomberg is a
young man and a graduate from den
tistry and is said to be well equipped
for the work in which he expects to
engage. Denison will be pleased to
welcome this young man and we trust
he will not be disappointed in choos

Newspapers of Washington Mention
Denison Young Man for Lieut.

Thomas A. E. Lally and wife, of Spo
kane, Wash., are speeding a few days
in Denis9n and -will remain until after
the wedding of Mr. Powers and Miss
Blanid, which occurs the 28th of June.
It hardly seems ntural to speak of
Thomas A. E. Lally, and we prefer to
mention him as Addis Lally because
of the fact that he grew up to man
hood here and as a boy went by the
name of Addis. He is looking as
young and vigorous as ever and his
very appearance indicates the prosper
ity which has come to'him in the prac
tice of law since he located at Spo
kane, Wash. The practice is not only
a lucrative one, but constantly grow
ing until he is considered- afnong the
eminent lawyers of the state. In, addi
tion, he has financial connections that
bring him in contact with the wealth
iest and best citizens of the western
country. We notice from the newspa
pers in the state that he is mentioned
as a candidate on the democratic tick
et for lieutenant governor of the state
and if he is willing to make the sacri
fice no doubt but what he can secure
the nominatiop. We fear he is too
young to enter the field of politics
and that it would be better for him to
confine himself to his profession for a
few years more, but we realize that
men of his ability and temperament
are not always able to keep out of the
game where brains and character are
demanded.
Mrs. Lally has visited in Denison
before and on her return here is Ap
preciated by those who formerly, met
her. She is a favorite in a social way.

PAVING WORK TO
Rumor Around Town That Pacing
Would Be Stopped In Stort Time a
Owing jto Shortage of Gravel
EXPECT TO FINISH IN 30 DAYS
Lake View Sand & Gravel Co. Furnitth
ing Contractor Eight Carloada: of
Gravel Every Day. "f'
For several days there has been a
rumor current that -paving operations
would cease in Denison for a time at
least on account of the lack df gravel.
There is ho truth to this rumor as City
Engineer Prank Woolston informed a
reporter of this paper today that
the pavemept as contracted for early
this spring would be completed.
It is true, however, that the addi
tional pavement, consisting of some
fifteen blocks, as announced In the last
issue of the Review, may be delayed
until next summer. The Lake View
Sand and Gravel company, who have
the contract for1supplying the Fllnti
Construction company with the sand
and gravel for the present paving, are
having considerable difficulty in fill
ing their contracts as they are fur
nishing material for a number of jobs
in northern and western Iowa and in
nearly every instance have been callfed
upon to furnish material for twice as
much paving in every place. Only re
cently they installed additional itia
chinery for digging and washing the
gravel, but even with this they are
only able to keep up yrith the orders
that they booked earlier in the year.
At present they are furnishing Mr.
Flinn with eight car loads a day.
There is some talk that Mr. Albert
Vernon who has a gravel pit near Boy
er may be able to furnish gravel for
the additional fifteen blocks 'of pave
