recovered today to take the stand.
The letters Orpet wrote Marian
were admitted In evidence this
afternoon.
Judge lionnelly allowed them
to go to the jury, although he re
cently said they would have a
damning effect on Orpet with the
jurymen.
The jury was dismissed from
the court room while the state'rp
attorney sketched the contents of
the lolig series of letters.
He showed that last tnimnier
the leaders were ardent and jeal
ous In tone. They complained
because Marian called him "dear
instead of "dearest" and nearly
all of them mentioned illicit rela
tlons. *
When Orpet returned to the
university In the fall, the letters
appeared to grow cooler. Marian
was no longer "dearest," but
merely "dear Marian."
Walter Maguire, chief of police
of Lake forest, testified that Or
pet had told him he never heard
Marian Lambert threaten suicide.
"1 asked Orpet how Marian **«_ll

Stephen Appleby, vice presi- j
dent of the Northwestern Busi

was an early visitor today in
Cut. Palmer's Armory quarters.
He issued a statement signed
by Ralph Stacy, president of the
National Bank of Tatxinia, to the
effect that all employes of that

lor a period of six months.
More Men Needed.
Appleby proffered his services
to the local troop in any other
way in which he could be of aid.
It Is believed by the recruiting
authorities that other banks and
mercantile institutions will fol

tional hank.
A proclamation was posted at
the Dupont powder works today,
stating all employes of Ihe na
tional guard would he carried on
the pay roll while in service. The
Crane Co. announced the same
thing.
It Is such sentiment that will
make recruiting a success. Fif
teen more men at least are need
ed in Troop B before It is
brought up to fighting strength.
If the fuli number Is not ob
tained from Tacoma, a number
of cavalrymen will probably he
sent to American lake from Walla
