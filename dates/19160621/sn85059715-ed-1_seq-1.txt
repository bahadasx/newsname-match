WASHINGTON, June 21.?Strong
pressure Is beinx brought to bear upon
General Carrunza by representatives
of European powers to prevent
him from forcing a break with tho
United States. Indirect reports reaching
the state department today tol?< '
of these efforts and said there was a i
possibility they would be successful, j1
ovuvaci ui luv bUlCIHO UIV
understood to be octlve tor peace. '
particularly, they say, because German
Influence haa sought to Inflame tho '
Mexican government against the 1
United States with a view to preventing
this country from gathering In
trade formerly controlled by Germany
In Mexico, South and Central
America.
It is pointed out that Carran/a '
might avoid war by calling tor an |
international commission to discuss
the border situation as provided tor
In the treaty of 1848. So far. hownvor,
no suggestion for such a step
has rome from Mexico.
A definite statement has been revolved
that General Carranza Is t
doing all In his power to protect
Americans In Mexico from attack by
the ponulace. He Is said to have
given Special Agent Hod vers In Me*
ico City all the aid in hin power in
arranging for trains to carry American
refugees from the Interior to; j
'v Vera Cruz. In some quarters here
4 this was construed as evidence that ;
B. he is not bent upon provoking hos- <
tiiities.
The state department had no ad- i
B vices bearing out these hopeful indi- ^
cations, except that from Special i ,
f Agent Rodgers announcing the prog- '
revs of his efforts to get American
citizens out. With the full consent
ot the Carranza authorities, he said, i
and the promise of adequate protection
from possible bandit attacks, he
had arranged for a special train to
leave Mexico City tomorrow carrying
Americans to Vera Cruz.
Marching orders for national
guard organizations summoned to
the colors are still held up at the war .
department, pending completion of
the mobilization of the troops at f
state camps. *
Just as soon as a sufficient number J
nf the guardsmen have been mimtereH
Into the federal service, the war department
will act upon Oeneral Winston's
report of yesterday stating the
number of units he desired. ,
Only preliminary reports on the ]
progress of the mobilization In various ,
states have reached the war depart- (
nient. These were viewed as satis- |
faclory.
Secretary linker said the suggestion
that the senior class at West Point ,
Military Academy bo graduated itnmc- i
diatoly for active service was under1,
consideration but that no decision had ,
been reached. The cadets have completed
three years of their work and
could be commissioned as second lieutenants
immediately.
