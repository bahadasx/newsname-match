tween
SUGGESTED THAI GOMMISSIOII
MAKII2G
Washington, June 21. Representa
tives of European powers, especially
the entente allies, are bringing strong
pressure to bear on Carranza to pre
vent him forcing a break with the
i United States, according to indirect
reports to the state department.
There is a possibility that they ,. will
succeed, it is said. The entente agen
cies are understood to be active par
ticularly because they believe Ger
man influence sought to inflame the
Mexican government against the
United States to prevent this coun
try from gathering the trade Ger
many formerly controlled in Mexico
and South and Central America. It
i3 pointed out that Carranza might
avoid war by calling for an interna
tional commission as provided by the
treaty of 1848. So far Mexico has
made no such suggestion. ,
IS TRYING TO PROTECT AMERI-
CAN CITIZENS
- Definite statements that Carranza
i3 doing all possible to protect Amer
icans have been received. It is said
he aided .Special .Agent- Rodgers at
Mexico City in arranging trains to
carry refugees to Vera Cruz. In some
quarters this is considered as evi
dence he isn't bent on provoking war.
Mr. Rodgers said he has been assured
protection if it became necessary for
him to leave. Newspapers corres
pondents are staying with Rodgers.
MEXICO USING THE EUROPEAN
. . PRESS
Paris, June 21. The Mexican lega
tions are placing Mexico's case before
Europe through statements in the
press. Those appearing in Madrid
and Paris assert the American expe
dition crossed the border while nego
tiations for permission were on. The
statements declare war is inevitable.
They say that the statement that
. Carranza's, attitude is due to German
intrigue came from American
'sources p.nd say the reports are un
warranted. Mexico, they declare,
doesn't want war.

To See How Well Marion County is
Holding Up Its End In Co-Operative
Farm Demonstration
Work
A. P. Spencer,, of Gainesville, dis
trict agent of co-operative farm dem
onstra'tion work, is in Ocala today in
the interest of his work. He com
nients favorably on the results ob
tained in Marion county, and express
ed the hope that the county will con
tinue to back up the work and give it
the support necessary to have the co
operation of the United States gov
ernment.
, For the demonstration work the
United States government agrees to
give to each county $600, with the un
derstanding that the county bears its
share of the expense.
Mr. Spencer referred to the fact
that R. W. Blacklock," the' demonstra
tion agent in this county, had provid
ed himself with a Ford car for the
purpose of covering the county more
effectively.
"Mr. Blacklock is devoting most of
his energy to the promotion of the
live stock interests," Mr. Spencer
said. "He met. recently with the
bankers of the county and has their
support in promoting a boy's pig club,
and he expects to have a good show
ing at the, fair."
"In handling these live stock prob
lems," said Mr. Spencer, "the county
agents do not work altogether on
their own initiative or information.
Recently Dr. A. H. Logan, expert for
the control of hog cholera, , made a
pretty fair canvass of. this county
with the county agent. Dipping vats
and similar things are being taken
care of over the state by specialists,
who work with the county agents."
CITY SHY ON SHEKELS
Movement on Foot to Return the Sil
ver Springs Road to the
County
Following the presentation of a
lengthy petition, signed by hundreds
of citizens, to have the Silver Springs
boulevard repaired and put in good
condition, council last night took
steps looking to the return of this
road to the county, y It was pointed
out that the city was without funds
and without the material necessary to
repair this road, or any thoroughfare
in the city. About $2,000 remains in
the city budget for street purposes,
and this must last until October 1. An
effort will be made with a view of
purchasing a motor, hoist and crusher
for the purpose of getting rock out
of the quarry in the city park. It is
thought that the city might be able
to obtain the machinery on a time
basis.
Councilman Gerig ' said he had
reason to believe that the county
commissioners would be glad to take
over the Silver Springs road again.
He said that Mr. W. D. Cam, chair
man of .the county commissioners, had
expressed himself to this effect. Mr.
Gerig moved that the street commit
tee and the city attorney confer with
the county officials to find out whether
or not some arrangement could be
made whereby the county would re
pair the road, with the understanding
that it would be taken over by the
county at the next ; meeting of the
state legislature,

tne people oi tne city irom - giving
any public demonstration of their
good will for their military company
ho far, and it being understood that
the soldiers were to leave early this
morning it was impossible to make
any plans in regard o their leave
taking. It occurred to the Star, how
ever, as soon as it know their de
parture was deferred that the people
would be glad to show(the boys some
token of their appreciation, and early
this morning it phoned to the presi
dents of the Woman s Club and the
Board of Trade, who took up the idea
at once.
It; is hoped to give the company a
demonstration when it drills on the
public square shortly after 8 o'clock
this evening. If possible to get the
members of the band together, they
will play a number of pieces, and the
square will be lit up. It will be the
duty and probably the pleasure of as
many of our people as possible to be
present to give our 'soldiers a send-
off that shall be auspicious of a
triumphant return when the trouble
is over. -.
The members of the W. C. T. U.
have undertaken the task of looking
after the inner man, and they will
pread a substantial lunch in the
armory, to be partaken of by the
young soldiers immediately after
their return from the drill. .
The Star desires to impress on our
people that it is their duty to turn
out in full force and give Marion
county's young soldiers an ovation,
the memory of which will cheer their
Marts in the months, perhaps .years,
that they will be absent in the camps,

This morning at 9 o'clock a tele
gram came from the adjutant general
saying that Governor Trammell had
requested the number of enlistments
up to that hour. The reply was that
the Rifles had recruited 32 men up to
that time, giving a strength of 95, a
remarkable showing.
About 8:30 o'clock this morning the
company lined up in front of the
armory to sign the muster roll. At!

San Antonio, June 21. General
Pershing has given Trevino an op

General Pershing reported to General

CHEAP TRANSPORTATION
Tampa Men Want to Establish a Jit-
ney Bus Line, for Ocala, Silr..
ver Springs and Lake, Weir 7
Charles H. Nash Jr., O. A. Hen
dricks and A. Alamo, of Tampa, who
were here recently looking over the
city, propose to operate a jitney bus
line in Ocala, and between Ocala and
Silver Springs and Lake Weir. Mr.
Nash, a brother of Councilman G. A,
Nash, appeared before council last
night and presented a petition for a
five-year exclusive franchise to op
erate the jitneys over definite routes
in the city. Council is of the opinion
that a jitney bus line as ' proposed
would fill a great want in the city and
between the city's pleasure resorts.
On first thought council believed
it would be impossible to grant an ex
clusive- franchise. The proposition
was referred to , the judiciary com
mittee and the city attorney and will
receive the consideration it deserves.
The jitney buses, which are built
something like a street car and can
carry sixteen passengers comfortably,
would be operated like a trolley over
definite routes and on definite sched
ules. The fare to any point in the
city would be five cents. The fare to
Silver Springs would tbe 15 cents one
way, and 25 cents for the round trip;
to Lake Weir 50 cents one, way and
$1 the round trip. It is proposed to
run a jitney every hour to the Springs
and make four trips a day to and
from the lake. .
It was pointed out in council that
the establishment of a jitney line with
a five cent fare and the low rates to
the Springs and the lake would have
a serious effect on the business of the
automobiles now operated for hire,
although the jitneys operated only
over definite routes.
Mr. Nash stated that the exclusive
franchise was asked for in order that
his company would be protected
against another jitney line being es
tablished in the city only large
enough for one line. He said that his
company felt that it should have
some protection for its investment.
Some of the councilmen thought that
the jitney line could be operated suc
cessfully without a franchise.
