(United Press staff correspondent.)
Jii'i-Hii, Juno 21. Taking advantage
v: a growing indifference to American
Minion, advocates of a strong subma
rine policy have re-opened the cam
paign for a more effective use of the
German U-boats.
The German people now realize that
bostillties will not end this summer and
nay drag into text year. Faced with
t'lis fact they are united in the desire
ti. see the war pushed with the utmost
v;gor until the allies are brsught- to
tonus. This 'feeling, spreading gradual
ly throughout the empire during the
pnsf few weeks, lias been seized upon a
weapon by the men who condemned
Chancellor Von Bothmann-Hollweg for
yielding to the United States in the re
C"nt submarine controversy.
The chancellor at the present mo
ment has the upper hand. But the re-'(-nt
slackening of the press censorship
has been followed by some bold state
ments regarding the effectiveness of
tiie submarine weapon which Germany
stir! possesses, and by renewed activity
on the part of the riavy league. It is
impossible to forecast what the result
v ill be if regard for American opinion
Rives way more and more to the deter
mination for aggressive measures to
bring the war to a victorious end.
Did Not Like Peace Talk.
Europe's unfriendly reception of
President Wilson's peace talk before
the League to Knforce Fence perhaps
caused interest in Germanv to veer
a.vnv from America. At any rate, it is
held here that the president's failure to
obtain a response lias not added to his
influence.
During recent conversations with
piblic men I have noted a general
enange in their attitude toward Amer-,
a. .Summed up, the German viewpoint
Tit;ht now is about this:
.Sixty per cent of Americans are
against us. Thirty per cent are for us.
'I'Mi per cent are indifferent. Nothing
y.j can do will change American opin
i 'ii 111 a way tlint will help us win the
var. U'e should go ahead then, eoncen
t'ating all our energy on victory.
. The military and economic situation
convince the Germans that they have
nulling to fear from a continuance of
the fighting. An admission in an article
i'i the London Daily .Mail that the Bri
twh food blockade cannot force Ger
many to terms has been widelv rend
io-re. Li view of the recent eight davs
or ram. followed by ideal weather for
eiops. the German people are convinced
ll'iit they cannot be starved out.
Do Not Fear Russians.
The Hussion offensive has not dis
terbed the public mind. The Cologne
C.,ctte declares that the Russians not
)i ly have been hilled but that a sue
'(.sstul German counter move is already
viler way. The K'ussians, the Gazette

Mexican Navy Said
To Be "Concentrating"
Washington, June 21. The Mexican
navy is concentrating off the south
east coast of Mexico.
The navy consists of the Zaragoss
and the Bravo,
The Zaragoss is a 1,181 ton training
ship that carried the name of Porfiric
Diaz until Diaz lost popularity in the
republic: It is 21.1 feet long and 32
feet wide and carried two 4.7 inch
guns, two old-fashioned six pounders
and two one pounders, similar to those
used by American warships to fire a sa
lute. The Znragoss used to be capable
of 15.0 knots an hour, but has been
badly battered in rebel engagements
and is an uncertain craft.
The Bravo is a 1,200 ton gunboat,
249 feet long, carrying two 'four-inch
guns, six six pounders and a torpedo
tube. The torpedo tube is reported use
bus, however, the Mexican nuvy at pres
ent having no torpedoes.

Mexico City, June 21. The special
train order by Special Agent Rodgers
to take Americans out of Mexico City
will not leave for Vera Cruz today us
was expected. Rodgera was notified at
an early hour by government officials
that preparations for the train's depar
ture have not been completed.
Another demonstration by working
men took place last night before the
national pniaee. Several thousand em
ployes of street car lines and factories
gathered to assure General Carranza of
their loyalty. Hundreds of school chil
dren and a lnrge number of women were
in the crowd. Carranza again addressed
this assemblage, repeating his previous
statements that Mexico was not seeking
war with the United States. There was
no disorder.
General liujioa, governor of ' the
state of Tabasco, informed General
Carranza last night that many- Ameri
cans in his territory did not" wish tr
leave the country in case of war, and
asked permission to remain. Carranza
sent an immediate reply instructing

Carranza Government Is

By J. P. Yoder

Washington, June 21. The Carraa

high administration official said todav
The machinery is crumbling and only
an unexpected, right about face in Car

official declared, even long enouuh for
it to be replaced by a government suf
ficiently strong to prevent near an
archy in the southern republic.
Such a situation bus been prophe
sied for months by some war and state
department officials. Because the ad
ministration, as repeatedly announced,
publicly has insisted on giving the Car
ranza government every chance to re
store Mexico to a real status among
nations, such official prophets have
been given Scant hearing. In some in

siloff's armies and appear to have
checked temporarily at least, the Rus
sian advance.
Four German divisions are being
rushed into action on the 30 mile
front from Brody southward to a point
east, of Przemysl. The Russians have
opened a heavy artillery attack on
this line, evidently in preparation for
a hard smash toward Lcmberg.
Dispatches from Berlin and Vienna
today admitted that the Austrian right
wing, under General Pflanzer, contin
ues a rapid retreat before the Russians
in Bukowina. The terrific force of
the Russian artillery lire is causing
Pflanzer to retreat rather than sacri

Berlin, .lime 21. The left wing of

Fear United States Designs to
Control the Entire
Continent
By Charles P. Stewart
(United Press staff correspondent)
Bciiuo A.yres, June 21. All South
America today focused its attention on
the Mexican-American crisis, awaiting
eagerly General Carranza 's next move
in reply to the American note.
The Latin-American association is
sued a call for a mnss meeting of pro
test against American occupation of
Mexican territory. The call for the
meeting mentioned the "intervention
ist tendencies of the United States
southward," vaguely hint'" bnt in
terventionists in the United States
threatened the safety of otiier Latin
American republics.
The Argentine papers are divided in
their sympathies. la Nucion, the most
influential newspaper in Argentine, at
tributes Mexico's present plight to
outlawry which Carranza is evidently
impotent to prevent. While practical
ly admitting the existence of a strong
nucleus of sympathy in South America
for Mexico, La Nucion adds:
"But the attitude of the United
States deserves ft tranquil view us long
as it maintains a guarantee of Mexi
can territorial integrity."
The newspaper Kazon publishes a
review of the situation under the head
line "Mexico's calvarv". The Union
suggests that possibly other national
may be interested, mentioned no
names, but evidently meaning Japan.
The newspaper Argentine says that
Mexico is simply suffering the conse
quences of anarchy.
Judge Decides They Are Com
petent and Material
Evidence
Courtroom, Waukegan, 111., June 21.
The letters that Will Orpet wroto Ma
rion Lambert wore admitted this aft
ernoon as evidence in Orpet 's trial
for Marion's murder. Judge Donnelly
ruled the letters admissable despite his
statements that he realized they would
"have a damning effect on Orpet 's
case with the jury."
The announcement by the judge that
tho letters would be read to the jury
was considered a distinct victory for
the state. Judge Donnelly announced in
court that he had read the letters last
night and admitted they had prejudiced
him. lie said, however, they seemed
competent evidence.
Tnese letters, 80 in number, detail
the efforts of Orpet first to win Ma
rion's love, second his cooling passion,
and last the way in which ho tried to
relieve Mnrion's illness, the result of
their intrigue. Most of them were writ
ten in French. An interpreter will read
them to the jury.
Hverett Frigiiuzu, a Chicago newspa
per reporter who had himself arrest
ed and thrown into jail with Orpet n
few days after tho youth was arrested,
testified for the state today.
Faiganza suid Orpet hud told him
conflicting stories, but that finally the
youth said he saw Marion take poison
in Helms woods.
"At first," Frignnza testified, "Or
pet said the first he knew of Marion's
death was when he read it in the news
papers. He told me she pleaded with
him not to leave her, but that he told
her in the woods that he was through."
Prefers to Testify.
Cuiirtriiom, Waukegan, 111., June 21.
Coloittiit Youker, the grey-eyed winsome
little school teacher whom Will Orpet
loved, faced tho ordeal of her life to
day. She ciime to court to testify for the
state in Ort.et's trial for Marion Lam
bert's murder. Forced to choose be
tween having her own love letters to
Orpet rend to the jury or testifying
against him. Celcstia decided to testify.
States Attorney Dndy will seek to
establish definitely, through Miss You
ker, that Orpet was engaged to her.
This, he contends, was the motive for
Marion 's murder.
The court room was jammed today by
the Orpet "funs" anxious to hear Miss
Youker. Several newspaper men who
talked to Orpet were to precede her to
th stand.

F.l Paso, Texas. June 21. General
Bell, Jr., commanding at Fort Bliss to
day denied rumors of fighting between
Carranza and United States troops
south of Namiquipa.
"If there was any truth in the report
I would hnve received official confir
firmation of tho fighting," said Bell.
Mexican sniping is believed to have
caused reports of a clash. However,
tho American forces and the Cnrranzis
tas face each other south of Namiquipa
and local authorities still believe a bat
tle imminent.
General Trevino, commander of the
north, is preparing to leave Chihuahua
City, with his staff, personally to take
the field, refugees declared.
Reports received by Btate department
agents indicate that the do facto gov
ernment is making every preparation
for hostilities. Troops are being mobol
ized, rocruiting is going on and largo
forces aro being sent to northern points.
Recent arrivals reported anti-American
demonstrations in several Mexican
states, encouraged by officers of tho do

Forces Face Each Other.
General Pershing is reported today at
Colonia Dublan where hi largest force
is entrenched. Preparations have been
mado to rush reinforcements to Nami
quipa if tho American troops there aro
attacked.
Motor trucks leaving Columbus with
ammunition and -supplies for the puni
tive expedition are heavily guarded.
Machine guns have been mounted on
the wagons. The trucks in the motor
trains have been instructed to keep
together in order to resist more effec
tively if attacked. Practically all trains
returning to Columbus reported sniping.
It is known that the column of Amer
ican cavalry was officially reported
within a short distance of "a Cnrran
zista force and that a conflict seem
ed imminent.
The situation alongthe border today
was more serious than at nny time sii.ee
the Mexican revolts began five years
ngo. F.I Paso authorities believe it. is
only a question of hours until the Uni
ted States and the de facto govern
ment will be in a state of war.
American refugees arriving from
Chihuahua declared there was a large
movement of Mexican forces from Chi

government is reported to have fully

Washington, Jnc 21. In view of the
incomplete mobilization of the militia,
the war department indicated it prob
ably would not issue orders sending new
forces to the Mexican border today.
Tho time of issuance of this order,
however, still was in doubt, but offic
ials say they would await until suffi
cient mobilization had been accomplish
ed before taking the step.
Secretary of. War Baker said his mcs-
'sages of the past 21 hours showed no
chango in the situation.

San Diego, Cab, Juae 21. That
Uncle Sam means business was indi
cated today by tho distribution of the
Pacific reserve fleet up and down too,
Mexican coast in such a way that an
immediate blockade may be called on
every Mexican port from Guaymas to
Salinns Cruz. Not even in the days
following the landing of American
bluejackets at Vera Cruz wero there so
many United States ships on duty at
the same time south of Son Diego as
toibiy.
At sunrise the "mosquito" fleet of
torpedo destroyers, consisting of the
destroyers Hull, Hopkins and Truxton,
with Lieutenant W. W. Bradley in
command, steamed out of San Diego
harbor for the south.
The boats were preceded late yester
day by the armored cruiser Pittsburg,
flagship of Hear Admiral Pullam, und
by tho nrmorcd cruiser Colorado. Tha
armored cruiser South Dakota is under
orders to sail from Bremerton for the
south tomorrow. She will pick up ma
rines at Paget Sound and stop at Son
Francisco to pick up an added quota,
of bluejackets.
With the sailing of the Sooth Dako
ta, every ship in commission in tbo Pa
cific reserve fleet will be either in
Mexican waters or headed south. The
navnl collier Mars was to sail from
Sail Diego late todity. This will empty
the harbor of the United States fleet
that has been anchored hero for some,
time.
The outgoing vessels havo been, coal
ed in record time. All hands pitched
into the job of filling the bunkers and
the ships wero still black with coal
dust as they raced for the sootii.
According to the present plans, the
Pacific fleet will be distributed as
follows.
At Mazatlan, cruisers, San Diego,
Milwaukee and South Dakota; Trans
port Buffalo, gunboat Annaoplis. At
Guaymas, cruiser Cleveland, armored
cruiser Maryland nnd supply ship Gla
cier. At Manzanillo, cruisers Pitts

The" destroyers Whipple, Paul Jones,
Preble and Stewart now undergoing ro
pairs at Mare Island, will bo available
for service by July 1.
War and navy officials today said
it would be a snisill matter compara
tively to blockade all of Mexico. But,
thev asked, "whom would we block
ade J"
The population already is near star
vation in many sections, tho declared,
and to put into effect a real blocliado
simply would mean lVrther suTTcring;
for those this government wishes to re
lieve. There would be no government,
with which to treat as to lifting such
a blockade. ,
For these reasons, administration or
ficials are even more determined to go
slowly. It was frankly admitted and
emphasized that the administration
will strain its powers to keep out ot
Mexico. ... ,
Although miinv officials believed
real action, if it comes at all, will not
come for several weeks, it was ex
plained that all haste will be made to
oct the militia to the border as soon
as practicable. Kxeept the men from
those states in the far south, the mili
tiamen must be uccliinated. It was ex
pected that after the militiamen reac t
the border a period of waitmR wil
follow while Carranza is given a final
chance.
