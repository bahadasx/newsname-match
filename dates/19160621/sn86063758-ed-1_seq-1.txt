Washington, June 18.?Virtually the
entire mobile strength of the 'National
Guard of all the States and the' District
of Columbia was ordered mustered
into the federal service tonight
by President Wilson. <Atbout 100,000
men are -expected to respond to the
can. They will be mobilized immediately
for such Service on the Mexico
> border as may later be assigned
to them.
Cfii. Funston, commanding the border
forces,, will designate the time and
place for movements of Guardsmen to i
the international line as the occasion
stall require.
In announcing the orders SecretaryBaker
said the State forces would b? ,
employed only to guard the border j
and that no additional troop move- i
merits into Mexico were contemplated j
except in pursuit of raiders,
i Simultaneously with thd National I
Guard call, Secretary Daniels of the j
navy department ordered additional
war vessels to Mexican waters on
both coasts to safeguard American j
lives.
At the war, navy and state depart-!
ments it was stated that no new ad-1
vices as to the situation in Mexico
"had come to precipitate the*- new;
:orders j
Within the last two weeks, however,
tension has been increasing j
i
steadily. The crisis presented 'by Gen/f
Carranza's note demanding the recall [
of Gen. Pershing's expeditionary forc-i
has been followed by a virtual ultimatum
served on the American officer
/by 'Gen. Trevino, the Mexican j
commander in Chihuahua. To this,!
was added yesterday, the possibility j
that American and Mexican troops!
"had clashed across the .border from !
San Benito, Texas. f
Administration officials made no!
attempt to conceal tonight their relief i
over the safe return of Maj. 'Ander- i
son's cavalry squadron to Browns '
ville after their successful bandit |
chase. The troopers crossed in pur- [
suit of bandits in the face of intima- j
tions that they would be attacked if J
they did sc. Gen. Funston himself ;
reported tbat he anticipated fighting
presumably with Carranza forces.

South Carolina Politics Compared to
National Politics as Described
By Writer in Daily Press.
Special to The Herald and News.
Columibia, June 19.?The .State campaign
will open at Spartanburg to
morrow morning, and will swing j
around through the Piedmont until it {
reaches Newberry on the first day of
July.
After it is all over, the people will

It seems that the old lines o-f '90 i
and '92 are going to be drawn this
year. Under different leaders the old
"Reform" party and the old "anti" or
"Conservative" party are battling. |
The recent State convention drew the !
line, and on one side or the other j
tlie people are massing.
In an article in the daily press on
Sunday morning, Mrs. Mary Roberts 1
Rhinehart, one of the mot gifted writ-1/
ers in the country today, in deploring i
the fact that the people had no real;
voice in the recent three national;
conventions, which were manipulated ;
by a few men, says:
"That is 'What these conventions I
have meant to me?a puppet ehow,!
with marionettes dancing to the beat-,
ing of a drum and waving the flag; !
i
and 'back at home the men who are '
interested only in the end is attained,1
a patriotic, but naturally lazy peo-!
pie, being Immibugged."
"Wakeup,'" she pleads, "to the fact!
that you ar& not ruling, but are beins;
rliled. Wfake up to the fact that in
the hands' of a dozen men or so, and i
those not of your own choosing, lies |
the fate of this country. Be frank
* ^ * ~ * j ?:ii. ^ ^
\viin yourselves aim wmn eauii uuiei. j
Break this conspiracy of silence and |
demand that the will of a majority of
the people shall prevail."
It was somewhat after this fashion, j
on a smaller scale, that the recent j
State convention was manipulated. In j
that convention there was a faction of j
the Democratic party ,of this State in J
control?a faction which will be'
known this year as the "aintis." j
Everything was cut and dried. An j
iron-clad program had been arrang-1
ed the night before, from which there ;
was not the slightest deviation. The |
ordinary delegate who came from the '
people had no voice. In the election j
of delegates-at-large there were eight;
of the faithful whom it was desired
:
to take care of?so that a "peace and
harmony" ticket of eight, with a half,
vote each, was decided on. They '
i * J r*r I
were nominated one Dy one dv tuner
er.t delegates from the floor?but
everybody in the convention knew ex- j
actlv who was to be nominated, and
1 I
by whom?and the people had no
l
voice. Even the gentlemen who re-1
signed the chief justiceship and put,
up sucl^ a stubborn fight in 1912 was
forgotten. The framing of the plat- j
form was after the same manner. So j
was the election of officers, and of;
national committeeman and State J
chairman. And in the election of na- i
tional committeeman and 'State chair- j
ma. it seems to have developed that j
there was even more of a ring within '
a ring than any except a very few ;
in the very inner sanctuary had any
idea of. Said the Columbia Record!

editorially, under date of June 15: j
"The news -comes from ISt. Louis that j
Senator Tillman has retired from the :

Columbia; June 19.?At 12 o'clock
noon today the lists closed for entries
in the Democratic primary for State
offices. Dr. E. C. L. Adams of Columbia
was a late entry for lieutenant
governor as was Mr. W. Banks Dove
clerk in the office for secretary of
State who enters for secretary of
State and 'Mr. McCown the present
secretary does not enter.
D. McLaurin opposes Mr. Carter
for .State treasurer. Attorney General
Peeples has no opposition and
neither has >Mr. Watson nor Gen.
Moore, nor Gen. C. W. Sawyer.
I. C. Blackwood enters for solicitor
of the seventh circuit against Albert
Hill.
The following is the complete list
of entries:

pressed a wish to die in harness, and
was so quoted. Before the 'State convention
met, one of (Senator Tillman's
secretaries was down here anxiously
inquiring about the situation," etc.,
etc.
That editorial followed the publication
of an article in the Columbia
State on the morning of June 15, in
which it was stated: "John Gary
Evans of Spartanburg has been elected
Democratic national committeeman
from South Carolina, according
to advices received in Columbia yesterday.
Mr. Evans succeeds Senator
B. R. Tillman, who desired to retire
from the national committee. Committee
assignments of the South
Carolina delegation in the national
Democratic convention at St. Louis
were contained in a telegram received
yesterday at the governor's office,"
etc. "The delegation meeting in St.
Louis elected Gov. Manning as chairman."
iXow comes the Record on Sunday
morning with the statement that the
report was "erroneous; that "we are
informed by the chairman of the
South Carolina delegation that these
reports were incorrect, and that Mr.
Evans merely held Mr. Tillman's |
proxy."
So that the State chairman is merely
"acting" for the national committeeman.
There will probably be some 'bitterness
in the campaign which opens
tomorrow at Spartanburg. There
usually is in a South Carolina campaign.
But it is well that we are to
have another iSitate campaign?and
the State campaign was probably
saved- by the people expressing themr^lves

whole situation will do .good, and -t
will be of inestimable value if the
people can be induced to demand .a
closer interest in their own affairs.

ressive farming communities in the
State and has the reputation of supplying
the family needs, as far as
possible, by home production. The
people are of that type who look upon
extraxagant living as a disgrace,
but at the same time, are surrounded
with plenty. They use but do not
abuse God's blessings. The stranger
at their gates, is never turned away
in want and a friend is overwhelmed
with their hospitality.
One of the evidences of the prosperity
and liberality of these people,
in this God favored corner of Newberry
county, was the imnlense table ^
on the church grounds last Sunday
CI IIVI OU UIUIICIV/U'O WCiC UtAC
and so bountiful the supply of good
things to eat, that it was impossible
to load it all on the long table, making
it necessary to spread on the
ground in other parts of the grove.
Sunday was an ideal day for such
an occasion and the church and the
grounds were full of people. !Mr. T.
M. Mills, the farm demonstrator for
Uncle Sam, was master of ceremonies
?he announced the songs and introduced
the speakers, or had it done.
The morning exercises consisted of
songs and prayer and the principal
address of the occasion by Lieutenant
Governor Andrew J. Bethea.
Mr, Betfrea was introduced by Prof.
J. Mocdy Bedenbaugh in a few well
chosen remarks. Mr. Bedenbaugh, in
prefacing his remarks leading up to
the introduction of the speaker, took
occasion to refer personally to a few
of the oldest people now Living in the
community?'Mrs. Louise Mayer who is
now 98 years of age; Mrs. Amanda

Dtnienuaugu, duuui ou, IUUI
Morris, 77; and Miss Laura Morris,
79.
Mr. Bethea's address was listened
to .jvith rapt attention from start to
finish. He stressed the importance
of right living,?clean living stripped
of all things that are unwholesome
and immoral. To give these abstract
truths a concrete form, 'he told of
some of his experiences while abroad
in Europe with Ford's peace expedition,
and gave them a moral application.
: . ' .
Ujlton the conclusion of ?\'r. Bethea's
address a collection was lifted for the
benefit of needy 'Sunday schools in
other section of the missionary field.
While the collection was being taken,
the choir gave a new and beautiful
rendition of the old song "Rock of
Ages.'' which was especially pleasing
to all who heard it.
Rev. E. P. Taylor extended thanks

and Mr. Moody Bedenbaugh informed
the congregation that dinner

After a most bountiful dinner which
has already been mentioned, the congreeation
reassembled about 2:30 and
