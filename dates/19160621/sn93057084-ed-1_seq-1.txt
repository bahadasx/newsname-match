SOME COGITATIONS ANENT FOR
EST CITY ROADS
It is reported that the mnterial
in the old ''Eiilam" bridge has
been sold for 8s.00. whereas The
Press is credibly informed that a
bid was made for the structure, in
writing, of 815.0(1.
Il is in order for the parties
mfikiny- this elaim to furnish The
l'ress with a deluded statement of
the t'fiots in the
cmm\
for the jro-
per enlightenment of the publie.
But even so, will that be of
any assistance in restoring the
'"Eidanv' bridge, or otherwise
taking care of our river front?
That is the question that, con
cerns The Press!
Somebody's attention needs to
be called to the fact, or else feet
and eyes directed to it, that Forest,
City has a inud hole on the road
south of town, leading to Pierre,
which is fed bv a spring, located
but a short distance from the road.
This mudhole needs a culvert, and
a little work done on it, if ever
any place needed it. The Press
would have sent this NOTICE to
our Hon. Board of County Com
missioners but for the fact that
there is more work of a similar
nature needed in this township,
and we do not think the commiss
ioners have any authority to ex
pend county road or other funds
in improving the Missouri river,
or making city property valuable
for town-site speculators, especial
ly for such fellows as the Forest
City Town Site Company, whose
president and secretary at last ac
counts reside in New York City,
and wink their eyes every time
they get reports of a rain in these
diggin's.
There area few people howling
in this country at the present time
about "Preparedness" —a word
like "Pork Barrel", by the way,
which covers a multitude of sins
and shortcomings of our National
Congress but "Congress" is made
up of Big Congressmen and little
Congressmen—no use talking
about reforming Cougress or get
ting rid of "Pork Barter' until you
turn the little Congressmen out
and also a few of the Big Congress
men, who should be dubbed
RASCALS.
Any milder term would only be
like water on a duck's back!
There are some who aint howl
ing—they are for "Preparedness"
all right enough. Then there are
others who are for "Preparedness"
—in the other fellow. There are
some examples of the latter class
living on the highway between
Forest City and Gettysburg, two
"ambitious" towns on the Red and
Yellow Trail—if you know where
that is. Not over a very few rods
from a certain farm house on this
trail there are three "chuck holes"
on the edge of two small sized
plank culverts. This condition
has existed for nearly a year, and
still the holes are there. We will
bet a pickayune that the farmer
occupying said residence could till
up said chuckholes in less than a
half days time: but why should
The Press make a kick about that?
We will proceed to turn our guns
on some leading people in Forest
City, who are also for "Prepared
ness"—when somebody else does
the work.
Of course, our County Commis
sioners owe Forest City twp a cer­
tain proportion of road money out
of the taxes we pay. Well, why
dont the fellows who say they aint
getting it. tell us how much of it
we are NOT getting, if they are so
expert at figures. The Press'
bookkeeper will try to tigure it
out some of these days for these
"wise guys": but we promise
them that t'hiistmas will be here
first, for "dont clier know", and
nn«iher ('hl istma. too, because,
we aint going to take him off of
the task of demonstrating to Ye
Editor how to get rich in a town
where the leading citizens are all
for "Preparedness" where the
other fellow does the work, and

It is a noticeable fact that the
Agency authorities have done some
good work on the Red and Yellow
Trail, commencing at the ferry
boat lauding and extending far out
on the road to LaPlant. There is
not a single bad spot now on the
Trail thru the Agency. .lust whv
the same thing is not duplicated
on this side of the river, The Press
would like to have somebody ex
plain. Of course "Uncle Sam" is
rich, and the Agency people
dont have to be taxed to do the
improving mentioned but. it is up
to Forest City to try: there is such
a tiling as a committee on "Ways
and Means" doing something to
make a beginning, even when
there are no funds in sight.
The validity of the petitions for
a vote on the license question at
Hoven and Tolstoy has been at
tacked by Rev. N. P. Johnson of
the Gettysburg Methodist church.
The cases are being brought in the
name of the state, by States Attor
ney Flickenger. Judge Bottom
was at Gettysburg last week to
hear the cases. The judge found
that the petitions were not suffi
cient and ordered the saloons in
the two towns to close their doors
.July 1st, when Potter County will
be without a saloon within its bor
ders.
Commissioner Chas. McCafl'ree,
of the State Bureau of Immigra

the latest official map of South
Dakota, showing also the leading
automobile trails, including our

own "Red and Yellow," from
Watertown to Belle Fourche and
the Black Hills. As we under
stand it, these maps can be had by
the readers of The Press or others
on application to the Commission
er, free of cost, and we would ad
vise our readers to get a few and
send them to acquaintances in the
