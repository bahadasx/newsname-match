SPLENDID RACE PROGRAMS
FOR COUNTY FAIR.
When the automobile came into
use, sportsmen of this country gen

would soon become a thing of the
past and that the only thing that
would interest the public would be
thrilling auto races. Since then
auto races have come and gone and
now a close and exciting horse race,
as an attraction at a fair, is again
the feature number of the program.
The leading fairs of the country
have recognized this fact and lay
special stress upon securing fast
horse racs. The Marshall county
fair will be among the big fairs in
this respect and already a large
string of thorobreds have been se
cured for the race meeting to be
held here July 4th and 5th.
$1,500.00 will be given as purses
for races during these two days.
On Tuesday, July 4th, two races
will be pulled off, each with a purse
of $300.00. Wednesday, the fifth,
three races of a first class nature
will be the drawing card.

journeyed to Thief River Falls Sun
day, where the local boys met de
feat at the hands of Nason's Nobles,
of that city. The victory was due
to the efficient work on the part of
the umpires, who were credited with
winning the game. According to
several hundred Warren fans, the
local team was given the rawest
deal in bad decisions, by the
"umps" that they have witnessed.
Scores of fans from Thief
River Falls admit this to be true and
became so disgusted with the deci
sions that they left the Thief River
crowd and joined the Warren root
ers. During the game a few Thief
River fans made some of the mean
est personal remarks concerning our
boys that we have ever heard at a
base ball game. They went as far
as to attack one of the Warren men,
which resulted in a scrap, that will
give the national game in that city
a very bad aroma.

victory. The Graftonites proved to

was to the local fans satisfactory,

Special Train to Ada.
There will be a special train to
Ada next Sunday on account of the
base ball game to be played there
by the Warren and Fergus Falls
crack teams. It is believed that
many will embrace the opportunity
to visit our sister city and enjoy
an outing. As the hotels in Ada
may not be able to serve dinner to
all visitors who come there that
clay, it has been suggested that
families bring their lunch baskets
and enjoy a picnic dinner in the

The programs for the five day
Chautauqua, by the Vawter Chau
tauqua System to be given in this
city August 3rd to 7th, has now
been arranged and promises to be
the biggest and best educational
and entertainment course yet shown
under the auspices of the local
Chautauqua management. The
course this year is of a higher
standard than of previous years
and ranks in the same class as the
Vawter Chautauqua programs to be
given in Crookston, Grand Forks
and other large cities in the valley.
-Mr. H. H. Preston, a well known
Chautauqua manager, will officiate
as superintendent of the local pro
grams, while Miss Marguerite
Schmitz has been selected as play
specialist for the little ones.
For Thursday, August 3rd, The
Savranoffs, clever Russian musicians,
with Russian instruments and mel
odies, will entertain at the after
noon and evening programs. In the
afternoon of this day Stewart I.
Long will deliver an inspirational
lecture on the work of "Reaching
the Goal". Fred J. Clark, with an
irstructive lecture on several kinds
of fools, will be the speaker in the
evening.
Friday, August 4th, The Old
Home Singers will entertain during
the two programs in the afternoon
and evening. Yutaka Minakuchi, a
great Japanese scholar and orator,
will discuss the problems of the
the borderlands of civilization in the
afternoon.
Saturday, August 5th, Cimera and
his great band will furnish a mus
ical treat at both progams. This
feature of the Chautauqua is one
of the most valuable to be secured
and it will be worth while for peo
ple to go miles to hear this great
musical organization.
The program for Sunday, August
6th, will be appropriate for the day
The Bohannans will render musical
selections. Dr. James L. Gordon,
Canada's greatest preacher a*id live
lecturer, will speak in the afternoon

vice will be held. In the evening

great many shams commonly prac
tised in the Moonshine districts.

day of the programs, the Christine
Giles Company presents several
musical and literary selections.
Ducrot, the wizard magician, will
next hold the attention of the audi
ence with his magic and illusory en
tertainments. In the evening,
Christine Giles and Bingham will be
seen in merrymaking stunts, the
peer of anything in the entertain
ment world.
There will be play festivals for
the children every day at nine
oclock in the morning under the
supervision of Miss Schmitz.
All the programs offered at this
Chautauqua excel anything ever
shown in this city, and we would
suggest that everybody make plans
whereby thev will be enabled to at
tend the Chautauqua at Warren
