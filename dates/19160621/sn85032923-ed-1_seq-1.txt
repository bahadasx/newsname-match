S. AND MEXICO MOBILIZING ALL
TROOPS ON BORDER, READY FOR EVENTUALITIES
, (J'.y Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, June 19. Wilson and his advisors expect hostilities after the note reaches Carranza refusing to recall United States troops. . The note will
be forwarded tomorrow to Mexican Ambassador Arrendondo. A hundred thousand guardsmen are mobilizing. Mexican feeling is inflamed and Carranza is
apparently sanctioning it. Worry is felt for the 5,000 Americans in Mexico. The navy guard colony near Tampico plans to rush an expedition to Mexico City.
In refusing to withdray- the troops the United States reaffirms the friendly intention of the United States toward the de facto government of Mexico and
sharply rebukes General Carranza for unwarranted charges and insinuations of bad faith contained in his communication. President Wilson's firm resolve to keep
the armed forces of the United States in Mexico until such time as the Mexican government polices the border region so thoroughly that bandit raids into Ameri
can territory are improbable is understood to be clearly stated in the note.
