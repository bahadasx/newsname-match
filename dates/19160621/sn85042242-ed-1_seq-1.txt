Ditch
Attorney General Henry J- Linde
has commenced an original action in
the Supreme Court of the United
'States in the name of the "State of
North Dakota against the State of
•Minnesota," to enjoin tiie latter state
against an unlawful iind damaging
trespass 'Upon the domain of the state
of North Dakota and the property of
its citizens of over one million dollars
in .value.
Over 12,000 acres of valuable, fertile
and productive land located in Rich­
land county, North Dakota, which has
been settled
upon
and improved by
citizens of North Dakota for a period
of upwards of :i0 years, comprising
more than SO farms with improve­
ments of over a quarter of a million
dollars in value, have been inundated
and covered with overflow water by
reason of a certain ditch constructed
by the siacu of Minnesota so as to
utterly destroy their use for agricul­
tural purposes.
No Overflow Normally.
Lake Traverse, and the Bois de ^io^x
river are located upon the boundary!
between the two. states. These bodies
of water form the natural outlet for
surface and other waters of a large
area of land in Minnesota. Under
nat/ural and normal conditions existing
for a period of many years there was
jiq
overflow upon North Dakota land.
Owing to the natural conformation of
the Minnesota area a large portion
thereof was annually covered with
water due to the overflow from the
lake and river.
Two shallow rivers, the Aiustinka
and Rabbit formed the main channels
for drainage of the Minnesota lands
into Lake Traverse and the Bois de
Sioux. Because of the comparatively
level formation of the prairie through
which these rivers flowed drainage of
the watershed was slow and gradual
and the volume of water reaching
'Lake Traverse was never such as to
cause anything other than a tempor­
ary overflow upon the North Dakota
lands.
Construct Ditch.
In 1911 the legislature of Minnesota
enacted a law authorizing the State
Drainage commission to construct an
artificial outlet for these waters. Un­
der the act a ditch was constructed
known as the Mustinka State Ditch.
After the construction of this ditch
the waters of the Minnesota area were
gathered toy a system of artificial
arms and channels into the state ditch
and were carried so rapidly and in
such volume into Lake Traverse and
the Bois de Sioux river as to overflow
th^ir banks and completely and per­
manently cover over 12,000 acres of
North Dakota land. Thus Minnesota,
by its artificial constructions, has
transferred the natural overflow of its
own waters to the lands and proper­
ties of North Dakota citizens. The
result of this disturbance of natural
and customary conditions is that many
public improvements upon such land
have been utterly destroyed and the
property of North Dakota citizens
ruined.
To Recover Damages.
"The action brought is in the nature
of a bill in equity," says Attorney
General Linde, "to restrain the State
of Minnesota from the doing of such
acts to declare them to be unlawful
to abate and discontinue the same
and for the recovery of damages for
the destruction of public property and
the injury to private citizens of Jsorth
Dakota.
"As the parties to the action pri­
marily are states of the union, the
Supreme Court of the United States
is the only tribunal which has juris­
diction. The action is a most unusual
one, there being but a few instances
in the history of this country in which
the original jurisdiction of the Su­
preme Court of the United States has
been invoked.
Los* of Over $1,000,000
"The damage to North Dakota lands
exceeds one million dollars. The loss
of crops in the year 1915 alone ex­
ceeds 150,000.00. The inability to use
the lands during the year 1916 caused
a loss of over $100,000. Unless the'
State of Minnesota is enjoined, the!
yearly loss will be over $100,000, and
the lands of North Dakota citizens

'Washington, June 20.—The Civil
Service commission ruled today that
the civil service employees will not
lose their positions through absencc
of less than one year for military ser­
vice, and announced that where ab
sences of more than a year should oc­
cur, the commission will recommend
reinstatement by the president. Hun­

city and other cities are members of
the National Guard and are being

atioflvdf the manner in .which elec'ion
inspectors are to be selected. The
court will hold that if any appointive
power inheres, the cily commission
possesses it as a body and tliat it
does not lie individually. This was
the contention of Commissioners Bat­
tey, Bertsch and Lucas, when Cily At­
torney McCurdy reported on Judge
Nuessle's opinion. They promptly
named the same inspectors as those
selected by the county board in or­
der to prevent confusion and dill-fcel
ing upon the eve of the primaries:.
While the court has not announce*!
the details of its opinion, the gen­
eral result was given out yesterday.
Action was started first by Carl
Kositzky to restrain County Auditor
Flaherty from delivering suplies to
inspectors named by the county
board. This writ was quashed because
of the irregular procedure, but at that,
time Judge Nuessle stated informally
his position, which wan that the city
commissioners should cast lots and
the one winning should act. as in­
spector in his precinct and appoint,
the other five to serve vlth him. This
was reported to the commission.
While willing to name the inspectors.
Commissioners Battey, Bertsch and
Lucas took the position that lots
should not be cast, but that the ap­
pointment should be made by the en­
tire commission. They then proceed­
ed to name the same Inspectors as
selected by the county board.
Then City Attorney McCurdy man
damused the city commission to pro­
ceed by lot to name the inspectors,
and it was upon this writ that a hear­
ing was held Monday before Judge
Nuessle. He ruled that the appoint­
ments must be made by lot.
Attorney General Miller, who rep
resented the city commission, ex­
tended that if any right inhered with
the commission it wan as a body arTd
not otherwise. It was on this point
that the appeal was made. As to just
where the power lay. it was admitted
by counsel that the law was defective
as no change has been made to gov­
ern commission forms of government.
This defect probably will be reme­
died, if any exists, along the lines in­
dicated by the opinion of the supreme
court.
The court, acted with unusual
promptness in the matter and clears
up a situation that might have proved
embarrassing in view of the short
time until the primary.
All sides are gratified that the point
has been decided wihout ill-feeling
on any side.

San Antonio, Tex., Juno 20.— Facing
Carranza's defiant army in Northern
Mexico, there will be stationed along
the Rio Grande within a week or ten
days, an American force that will to­
tal almost 70,000 men- General Funs
ton has requested the war department
to send him as quickly as possible a
large part of the National Guardsmen,
and advices indicated that entraining
of the first troops would be begun to­
morrow. As fast as they arrive in
the south they will be sent to the sta­
tions chosen, but a part will be with­
in sight of Mexico when they get oft
the trains.
General Funston did not announce
how many he has aske.Tl for, nor the
stations to which they will be sent,
but it is known that he expects more
than a division, and it is said not less
than 28,000 would be sent.

and members of his staff.

/Already the border army, made up

The army, already patroling the in­

any aggression. It. was demonstrated,
however, that it was not big enough
to guard the long lin^ from Browns­
ville to the Pacific, and army officers
never have regarded it as strong
enough to undertake an invasion in
force.
Wants Enough for Protection.
General Funston's request for the
guardsmen was for "a number suffi­
cient. to give adequate protection to
the border." Officers at his headquar­
ters also slate that with this increas­

on Verge
of Clash
Oolumbus, N. M., June 20.—Carran­
zistas and soldiers of General Per­
shing's expeditionary force were on
the verge of hostilities, according to
a lield dispatch tonight. A dispatch
from Col. D. C. Cabell, General Per­
shing's chief of staff, said that the at­
titude of the Carranzistas was such
that American motor truck supply
trains are in danger of being fired on.
The Carranzistas are said to have
mounted artillery in positions menac­
ing the Americans, and dispatches in­
dicate that with Ihe two commands in
close proximity, the danger of a clash
is increasing.
Persistent rumors were current
here tonight that General Pershing
has split his command into three col­
umns, each prepared to move, in the
event of hostilities, while others said
that truck trains had been fired on.
However, no confirmation of the re­
ports could be obtained at military
headquarters here.

An invitation was extended yester­

tee through Gov. Hanna, General

officials expressed their appreciation
of the club's courtesy and if the troops
are still in the mobilization camp at
Fort Lincoln, which it is thought they
will be, the soldiers in kahki, with the
regiment band in the lead, will head
the pageant.
Events of the last 24 hours were re­
flected in the action of Bismarck's
Fourt of July committees, when they
decided to make a master "Prepared­
ness Parade" the feature of the Capi­
tal City's celebration of the nation's
birthday. Originally, it was the in­
tention to hold a floral, industrial and
commercial parade on Monday, July
and a patriotic, civic and military
parade on Tuesday, July 4. Last eve­
ning it was the concensus of opinion
that all energies shoulu be concen­
trated on the "Preparedness" parade
for the Fourth, which will be the most,
impressive enterprise of this nature
undertaken to date in the northwest.
Every civic, fraternal, military and
semi-military organizations in the Bis­
marck territory every commercial
and industrial institution every mun­
icipal, county and state organization
ordepartment all public and semi
public bodies will be invited to parti­
cipate in the demonstration as a
whole, while all individual citizens of
the Slope country in attendance at the
celebration will be urged to take part.
The present prospects are that from
two to four bands will be on hand to
lead the procession there will be
scores of beautiful patriotic and alle­
gorical floats dozens of appropriately
decorated automobiles, and, it is pre­
dicted, from 3,000 to 5,000 men, wo­
men and children in line. The prepar­
edness parade will terminate with
patriotic exercises in the auditorium,
at which the principal orator prob­
ably will be a man prominent through

large for his military achievements.

CRANDE IN CIVILIAN
Absolute Refusal to Withdraw
Troops from Mexico Re­
ply to Demand
PROTECTION OF BORDER
IS ONLY OBJECT
Believed Next Forty-eight Hours
Will Clear Up Entire
Situation
Washington, June CO.—The issue of
war or peace with Mexico hung in
the balance tonight, awaiting General
Carranza's decision as to the couroe
he will pursue. Officials here believe
that 48 hours might bring a clear un­
derstanding of what the immediate
future has in store. A note sifned
by Secretary Lansing, conveying Pres­
ident Wilson's rejection of the de-'
mands for withdrawal of Americas
soldiers from Mexico, ateOfflpWiad.^by
a-specific warning that an attack on
the troops "will lead to the gravest
consequences," was telegraphed to
Mexico City today iby Elisio Arredon
do, Mexican ambassador-resignate. In
plain terms, it accuses General Car*
ranza of having brought matters to
the verge of war by open hostility to­
ward the United States, and failure
to safeguard even the lives of Ameri­
cans in Mexico or on the border from
the lawless element among his coun­
trymen.
Resents Imputation.
In sternest terms, the note repudi­
ates and resents imputations of bad
faith and ulterior motives brought
against the Washington government
in the Mexican communication to
which it is a reply. General Carran
za is informed in so many words that
protection of its own borders is the
only object sought by the United
States, and is told that that object
will be pursued, whatever the conse­
quences may be.
When the note had been banded to
Mr. Arredondo for delivery to his
chief, copies were sent to all embas­
sies and legations for their informa­
tion. A summary was telegraphed to
Special Agent Rogers in Mexico City,
that he might wisely counsel Ameri­
can residents there. He will not com­
municate it to Carranza officials.
Mr. Rogers reported during the day
that lie had arranged for a refugees'
train to carry Americans and other
foreigners from Mexico City to Vera
Cruz. He expects to see it off to­
morrow, but will remain at bis post
himself unless a declaration of war or
a deliberate act of war by the de
facto government should make it ne«
cessary for him to leave.
Mobilization Proceeds.
Mobilization of the National Guards
men is proceeding expeditiously in all
states and plans for sending some of
them southward in response to a re­
quest from General Funston are un­
der way. Secretary Lansing today de­
scribed the policy of tbe government
as being founded only on a resolve to
protect the border. That policy has
not been changed, he taid/and no
military step that has been taken has
any other object. General Carranta
was officially informed of this in the
note which went forward today.
General Funston sent a lone code
dispatch to Secretary Baker today, in*
dicating what portion of the 100,000
guardsmen ordered under amis to
needed immediately to stiffen his bor«
der guard. The points at which hie
wishes the men mobilized and the
proportion of infantry, cavalry and
artillery, he desires to have at each
place were included.
Assignments from First Unit,
Assignment will be made from the
first state unit to be mustered into

None of the guardsmea summoned
under President Wilson's call were
