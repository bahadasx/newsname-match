BIG STONE GAP FURNACE
TO RESUME OPERATION
Kelly & Irvine to Put {?'in?
line Into Blast. Repair
Work Will Be Rushed to
Completion. Ore Mines
Will Also Open Up
and Emplo y Many
Men.
Messrs. Kelly anil Irvine will
rebiiild and operate the furnace
nt iliia place. In fact work linn
already begun, and will bu
pushed ha rapidly an possible.
I 'bey lira the owners of the fur
liaco plant, also the coking
plant, known us thb Josephine
plant, near Norton, and of ox
tensive iron ore lands in Wise
and Ben Counties. All these
properties uro to be combined
ioto one ownership, ii will
probably In-known as tin- Inter?
ment Coal and Iron Corpora
'inn, ami this corporation will
issue hauiis oil all its properties
fur Btiltlcio'ut funds to modern
i/,0 and rebuild the furnace anil
enlarge and improve the eoal
mines and eoke oven plant and
the iron mines and run the fur
liace on modern lines with am?
ple operating capital in reserve,
I he bonds of the new company
w. re subscribed for last week
and the dnal was (dosed with
Itichinond capitalists, It has
bei ii known for some time thai
Messrs; Kelly iS;. Irvine were
working on this consolidation
of their valuable properties with
u view to manufacturing pig
iron here again, and the an?
nouncement that thoy have sue.
c.eedod in their plans will be of
tlui greatest interest to not only
the people of Big Stone Gap,
but all of Southwest Virginia.
The new corporation will own
all its own raw materials, and
it is said that the ingredients
entering into pig iron can be
assembled more cheaply at this
furnace at Big Stono (Jap than
al any other place in the coun?
try. The furnace here has been
idle since the panic in 15)07.
This was caused partly by the
bad condition of the iron mar
kiil am! partly because costly
i .pairs were necessary to make
it a modern plant. The iron
market is now again strong ami
noli making very profitable,
ami with the furnace having
till its own raw materials right
hand, it seems certain that
pig iron can be made here at a
good profit whenever there is a!
prellt in it anywhere. The Jo?
sephine coke plant has been in
successful operation for many
yt'ars. Messrs. Kelly & Irvine
for some years prior to 11)07, dp
united successfully several iron
mines in this section and ac?
quired a largo amount of iron
ore lands in fee simple. Mining
on a large scale will be resumed
at all these mines, and several
Im nil red men will he given em
ploy man I tit the mines, the coke
plant ami the furnace.
I> is understood that Mr. B.
'I'. Irvino will be president of
tile new company, Dr. .1. W.
Kelly, secretary and treasurer
and general manager of the iron
iniiies and coke plant, while
Mr. II. K. Maiiry, of Anhiston,
Alabama, one of the best known
und most highly esteemed fur
n ice engineers and operators in
the South, and a man of large
experience in his profession,
luis been engaged to rebuild the
furnace and act as general man?
ager of the furnace plant.

Field Day.
i in Thursday of last Week

west District hold their first
I'ii'hl Day at Big Stone Gap. A
fair-sized crowd toi ttiossod the

3:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
The order of march was as fol?
lows: Scout Karl Knight,
bearing a mammoth United
States Flag, followed by Scout?
master Alfrientl. Then came

ami gave a fancy exhibition uf
riding,resplendonf in a costume
that ih-lies adequato description.
The second clown ambled along
on his own feet, carrying a
wonderful camera. This photo?
grapher was evidently from
the -'sti''ks" and lost no oppor?
tunity of securing snap-shots
of tint crowd that lined lite
streets. Behind the clowns
marched the Gap Scouts, head?
ed by the senior patrol leader,
llrst class Scout Gordon Good

Reginald Smith carried the
Troop ling. Bringing up tint
rear of the column were the
visitors, headed by Assistant
.Scoutmaster Itoe I'.artle, of the
Ksserville Seouls. The Norton
hoys hud one representative.
There would undoubtedly have
been several more troops repre?
sented in the parade, had the
weather not been so threaten
in",. At Kelly's l>rug Store
corner the procession halted,
while the Hand played a selec?
tion. Then the march was re?
sumed, and (ho parade ontored

CALOMEL DYNAMITES A
SLUGGISH LIVER.
Crashes Into a Sour Bile,
Making You Sick ami
You Lose a Day's
Work.
Calomel salivates! It's mer?
cury. Calomel acts like dyna?
mite on a sluggish liven When
calomel comes into contact
with sour bile it crashes into it,
causing cramping and nausea.
If you feel bilious, headachy,
constipated and all knocked
out, just go to your druggist
and get a 60 cent bottle of Dod
son's Liver Tone, which is a
harmless vegetable substitute
for dangerous calomel Take .1
spoonful and if it doesn't start
your liver and straighten you
up better and quicker than nas?
ty calomel and without making
you sick, you just go back and
get your money.
If you take calomel today
you'll be sick and nauseated to?
morrow; besides, it may Sali?
vate you, while if you take
Hudson's Liver Tone you will
wake up feeling great, full of
ambition and ready for work or
play. Its harmless, pleasant
and safe to give to the children;
they like it.?adv.
St. Louis
Convention.
Wilson and Marshall Head
Democratic Ticket.
Ticket Named By
Acclamation.
Coliseum, St. Louis, Mo.,
.Inno 17.- President Wilson
and Vice-President Marshall
were nominnted by dcolainution
tonight by the Democratic na?
tional convention, the ticket
boing completed four minutes
before Friday.
Contrary to expectations, the
convention did not finish its
work because the platform was
not ready and it will moot
ngiph at ii o'clock Friday
morning.
It was ttlinotinced in the con?
vention that the sub Committee
drafting the platform hail
finished its work, hut that the
entire resolutions committee
was not assembled to pass up?
on it President Wilson's own
plank charging conspiracy
among some foreign-born citi?
zens for the bcuclit of foreign
powers and denouncing any
political parly which benelits
and not repudiating such a
situation, was incorporated in
the platform, just as the Presi?
dent had sent it from Washing?
ton. It was understood that
(be President insisted that the
plank should be put in the plat
form in the why lie hud drawn
it.
Doubt Only as to Marshall.
Then' never was any doubt
nf President Wilson's nomina?
tion tonight, but there was a
possibility that some Vice-Pres?
idential bourns might bo
brought out in opposition to
Vi.President Marshall, They
molted away, however, when
the convention got in session
and as soon as President Wil
son's nomination had been
made by a roaring chorus of ac?
clamation, Senator Kern, who
reitoiitinateil Mr. Marshall, cast
aside a long prepared speech
and simply declared:
"I nominate Thomas Biley
Marshall, of Indiana, for Vice
President."
To President Wilson's nomi?
nation there was only olio dis
Heuling vote, Bobort Knunet
Burke, of Illinois, who came to
t he convention announcing that
lie was opposed to the l'resi
dent. His vote technically
made the President's nomina?
tion 1,091 to 1.
Roll of States Called.
Then the roll of the Slab's
was called' for nominations.
Alabama yielded to Now Jer?
sey and judgo Jnhli W. Wes
c.ott nominated President Wil?
son.
Judge Wesoolt spoke very
slowly. At the rate he uttered
bis first three hundred words it
would reipiiro about one hour
and twenty minutes lb eon
elude.
The delegates were attentive
and ipiiet as Judge Weseott
proceeded, but the galleries
were impatient.
"Name him, name him",came
cries from the galleries and
Judge Woscott hurried his
speech.
Great Demonstration.
As he closed at 1.0:49, with a
mention of the name of "Wood
row Wilson", the crowd broke
into a great demonstration.
There was no attempt to con?
trol tlie crowd. Men and women
overran the platform and 'he
press sections at will. The pas
sages to the telegraph rooms
were so packed with persons
who had no business in the
vicinity that only those who
bud their telegraph instruments
on the platform could send the
news of the convention to the
outside world. The police made
no effort to control the situa?
tion.
The nominations of both
candidates wore completed four
minutes before midnight.
Robert Emmet Burke, of
Illinois, a delegate who an?
nounced he would not vote
for the President, raised the on?
ly voice in opposition. He was
elected as an independent;
Many delegates and specta?
tors made a rush for the eKItrt
when the Vice-Presidential
nomination wax made and
Senator James with great dif?
ficulty restored order.
Resolutions wen- thou adopt-!

Co. H Ordered
To Richmond
Capt. Bullitt Receives In?
structions to Prepare
to Move.
Capt. Bullitt, of Company 11,
Second Regiment Virginia Vol?
unteers, received a tologrnm
Mondaj from t'id. Leady mating
that the Bcgiment had been or.,
tiered to mobilize immediately
at Richmond. Company II was
ordered to prepare to move at
unco, on telegraphic order. Or?
ders to move are expected to?
day : Wednesday). further or?
ders to recruit to full strength
have been received and etforts
are being made to secure volun?
teers.
Every man in Company 11
must go to Richmond. Under
the new law as it now stands
every member of the Virginia
Volunteers must mobilize at
that point and be ready to go to
the Mexican border. Thore is
a question tvhethbr any mail
can be sent into Mexico unless
In- voluntarily takes the new
oath prescribed by the re
COO! act of congress, but it goes
without saying that practically
all. if not all, will prefer to get
into i be real game rather than
sit down on the border to ho
eaten by sand llies ami mos
qusloca and incur the odium of
not being game
A number of applications
have already been received
from new men.
Some .if the men in Company
II are married men ami cannot
well itlTord to leave their homes
and families. The fact is that
the families of some of them
would he left destitute if the
men w ei o absent for any length
of time. A movement is al
leady on foot.started by Mr. B.
B. Alsover, to raise funds by
subscriptions from citizens of
the town to take earn of all
BliCh eases.
Mr. Alsover's idea isthat true
patriotism requires sacrifice
and work of those who remain
at home commensurate with
that of those who go to the
front.
