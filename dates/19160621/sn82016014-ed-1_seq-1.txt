El Paso. June 21. Gen. George

Texas, denied rumors of fighting be

troops south of Namiquipa.
"If there was any truth in the re

Bell.
Mexican sniping is believed to have
caused reports of a clash, however.
The American force and the Carran

a battle imminent.

Kansas City, June 21. Lawyers
representing claimants against the
Kansas City, Mexico & Orient railway
were before Judge John C. Pollock of
the United States district court in
Kansas City, Kan., today.
They urged the completion of the
reorganization started two years age
when the receivers were discharged
and the company was bought for $6,

purchase of the properties has been
paid. The lawyers desire the different

C. W. Kouns. general manager of
the Santa. Fe, this morning issued a
statement to all employes of the sys
tem assuring them that their positions
will remain open if they enlist in the
national guard. Mr. Kouns went even
further by making provision for other
positions as remunerative, if possible,
for all employe crippled in the United
States service :n the event of war.
In Topeka twenty-two Santa. Fe em
ployes are members of the national
guard. Over the entire system the
guardsmen on the Santa Fe payrolls
will go beyend the hundred mark. H.
W. Dun, an employe in the chief en
gineer's department, left Topeka to
day for New York, where he is a mem
ber of the national guard. Santa Fe
guardsmen in Topeka include shop
men, ap rentices and office men.
May Pass Special Law.
So far as is known the Santa Fe
is the first concern employing a large
number of men to take this step which
will undoubtedly stimulate enlistment.
In Washington Tuesday, President
Wilson discussed with his cabinet
plans for preventing the loss of sal
aries or positions by government em
ployes called into service with the
national guard. Congress may be
asked to pass a special law covering
such cases.
Promptly at 1 o'clock, the battery
boys began packing their equipment

utensils will not be placed on the
cars until final orders are received.

The Trade.
They bear, in plaoe of classic names, let-,

Letters and number on their skin:
They play their grisly, blind-fold games
In little boxes made of tin.
Sometimes tbey stalk the Zeppelin,
Sometimes they learn where mines are laid
Or where the Baltic ice is thin
That is the custom of "The trade."
II.
Few prize courts sit upon their claims;
They seldom tow their targets in ;
They follow certain secret aims
Down under, far from strife or din.

No flag is flown, no fuss is made
More than the shearing of n pin

London, June 21. No one knows
how the title "The Trade" came tp be
applied to the submarine service.
Some say the cruisers invented it be
cause they pretend the submarine of
ficers look like unwashed chauffeurs.
Others think that it sprang forth by
itself, which means that it was coined
on the lower deck, where they always
have proper names for things.
' Whatever-'the truth,the- -subfttartrre
service is now "The Trade," and if you
ask them why, they will answer:
"What else could you call it?"
"The Trade's" the trade, of course.
It is a close corporation, yet it re
cruits its mn and officers from every
class that uses the sea. and engines as
well as from many classes that never
expected to deal with either. It takes
them; they disappear for a while and
return, changed to their very souls, for
"The Trade" lies in a world without
precedents, of which no generation
has had any previous experience a
world that is still being made and en
larged daily. It creates and settles its
problems as it goes along, and if it
cannot help itself, no one else can.
Lives in Dark.
So "The Trade" lives in the dark
and thinks out inconceivable, impos
sible things which afterward it puts
into practice.
It keeps books, too, as honest trad
ers should. They are almost as bald
f. s ledgers, written up hour by hour on
a little sliding table that pulls out
from beneath the commander's bunk.

Five Killed in Explosion.
Parry Sound, Ont.. June 21. At
least five workmen were killed and
twenty seriously injured here today in
an explosion followed by fire in the
plant of tne Canadian JExpiosives,
Limited.
The explosion occurred in a shrap
nel factory, housed in a large building,
which was destroyed. The caui-j of
the explosion was unknown. About
seventy men were at work in the
building at the tirne
down town winding up their personal
affairs.
Dr. Seth A. Hammel, captain of the
medical corps, called at the camp
armed with pills for the "first victims"
of camp cooking. So far all have sur
vived. The menu for breakfast in
cluded, cantaloupe, scrambled eggs,
fried bacon, potatoes and coffee.
Need 173 Men.
Battery A has been ordered to begin
loading at noon today. That was the
announcement made this morning by
Capt. J. M. Hite. commandant of the
battery. Nine flat cars were side
tracked at the fair grounds early this
morning. The stoves and other
kitchen utensils will be the last of the
equipment to be placed on the cars
in order to care for the men until the
final command comes ordering the
battery to Fort Riley.
Captain Hite further announced
that the battery is recruited to full
peace strength of 1S3 men. This
means that it can be moved to Fort
Riley for mobilization and that a re
cruiting station will be maintained at
Topeka until the company is recruited
to its full war strength of 173 men.

A patriotic parade was held on Kan

Nogalcs, Ariz., June 21. Coincident

Army officers in Nogales, in no way

Santa Cruz valley - between Nograles
and Tucson, if a break should come.
It is pointed out that all Sonora faces
starvation if the border remains closed
to food supplies, and that a foray into
this section would be the logical de
velopment. General Gomez is now at FVonteras,

Secretary of War Baker declined to
make any statement on the subject,
but high officers said announcement
ef the plan awaits upon news from
General Pershing's headquarters.
Officials declared there are only
two alternatives for Carranza. Either
he will submit tamely to threats of
physical force contained in faecretary
Lansing's note, or he will call on all
Mexicans to make war on the United
States.
In the first evei.t the federal army
now in Mexico or along the border,
supplemented by the 100,000 or more
national guard trt ops to go there, will
be sufficient to carry out any further
waiting and watching policy.
May Need Half Million.
In the secor.d event, officials have
decided, it will require probably half
a million more men to face the situa
tion in Mexico. Reports from Gen
eral Pershing stated that Mexican
people within the sphere of influence
of the American army were opposed
to Carranza. This condition does not
obtain, it was admitted, in territory
really controlled by Carranza.
Military experts pointed out that a
campaign in Mexico today would not
be like that of General Scott, in which
from 6,000 to 10.000 men reduced the
country. At that time the peons were
not in arms and swearing vengeance
against the United States, and vic
tories were so decisive there was little
guerilla warfare. The conditions have
entirely changed. Various boards
have estimated the number of men
necessary - for a Mexican campaign.

would not go into Mexico unless he
had an initial army of 250,000 and
500,000 volunteers to draw from.
In order to be successful, he stated,
the United States should be in force at
every seaport and at every important
interior town in Mexico.
Army of Cavalry.
Practically a whole army of cav
alry is needed now. this officer said,
to fight guerilla bands into which the
Mexican army will break up when it
is defeated in a pitched battle.
In view of the note sent Tuesday,
it was intimated General Pershing will
concentrate at one station on his line
between the border and his southern
base in Mexico. Some officers believe

up at the war department pending
completion of the mobilization of the
troops at state camps. Just as soon as
a sufficient number of the guardsmen

Only preliminary reports of the
progress of the mobilization in various
states had reached the war depart
ment today. These were viewed as
satisfactory-
Secretary Baker said the suggestion
that the senior class at West Point
Military academy be graduated im
mediately for active service was un

had been reached. The cadets have
comdeted three years of their work
and could be commissioned as second
lieutenants immediately if the emer

department had no additional aavices
