100,000 State Troop* Ordered War With Mexico Dmmrl* or, I Wil.f.- ' u?1?" M 1 '
To Mobilization Camps To
Get Ready For Service
On Border
Washington, June 18.?Virtually
the entire mobile strength
of the National Guard of all
States and the District of Columbia
was ordered mustered into
the Federal service tonight by
President Wilson. About 100,000
men are expected to respond
to the call. They will be mobilized
immediately for such service
on the Mpxiran hr?rrt*?r oc
may later be assigned to them.
Gen. Frederick Funston, com
manding the border forces will
designate the time and place for
movements of guardsmen to the
international line as the occasion
shall require.
In announcing the orders Secretary
Baker said the State
forces would be employed only
to guard the border and that no
additional troop movements into
Mexico were contemplated
except in pursuit of raiders.
Simultaneously with the national
Guard call, Sectetary Daniels
of the Navv Dnnartmanl
ordered additional war vessels
to Mexican waters on both
coasts to safeguard American
lives.
At the War, Navy and State
Departments it was stated that
no new advices as to the situation
in Mexico had come to pre- i
cipitate the new orders.
Within the last two weeks, however,
tension has been in <
creasing steadily. The crisis i
presented by General Carranza's !
note demanding the recall of i
General Pershing's expedition
ary force has been followed by a s
virtual ultimatum served on the 1
American officer "by General"* *
Trevino, Mexican commander i
in Chihuahua. To this was add <
ed yesterday the possibitity that !
American and Mexican troops I
had clashed across the border i
from San Benito, Texas.
Administration officials made <
no attempt to conceal tonight 1
their relief over the safe return
of Major Anderson's cavalry <
squadron to Brownsville, after i
their successful bandit chase. I
The troopers crossed in mirsuit 1
of bandits in the face of intima- 1
tions that they would be attack- \
ed if they did so. General Fun- j
ston himself reported that he an- 1
ticipated fighting presumably
with Carranza troops.
Mobilization of the National
Guardsmen to support General j
Funston's line will pave the way ^
tor releasing some 30,000 regu- ,
lars for immediate service in ,
Mexico in the event of open "(
hostilities with the Carranza j
vjovernmeni. l he guardsmen j
themselves could not be used ^
beyond the line without author- t
ity of Cougress and until they
had volunteered for that duty. {
as thev are called out under the old
militia law. The new law, v
which would make available j
for any duty under the Federal ^
Government goes into effect *

of Texas, New Mexico and Ari- r
zona are now on the border or
in Mexico. Definite figures \
never have been made public, t
but it is understood General c
Funston has about 40,000 regu f
lars, and probably 5,000 or more t
guardsmen of whom 10,000 reg v
ulars are with General Pershing I
or scattered along his line of e
uijiuiiiu.iicaiions trom Namiqui s
pa, Mexico, to Coluinbus, N. M. 1
Telegrams calling for the mi c
litia were sent tonight to the tl
Governors of all States except r
the three whose guardsmen al- d
ready have been mustered in, ii
after all-day conferences at the h
War Department. ti
C&rranza
Washington, June 19,?War
with Mexico depends upon Gen 1
eral Carranza's reception of a t
stern refusal by the United 1
States to heed his demand for a 1
recall of American troops, in t
the opinion of President Wilson's i
close advisers. They were prepared
tonight for the possibility <
of open hostilities after the note, s
which will be sent forward to t
morrow, has reached Carranza's i
hands. I
The reply to Carranza's note i
demanding recall of General >
Pershing's expedition was in the j
hands of the Government print s
er tonight preparatory to its de- i

uveiy aou puoiicauon tomorrow, t
Secretary Lansing had intended i
to send it forward today, but at
the last moment minor changes c
and additions to the 6,000 word t
document necessitated delay, j
Although it had been planned to c
send it by special messenger to c
Mexico City the situation has c
changed and it probably will be s
handed to Eliseo Arredondo, \
Mexican Ambassador designate, s
While the diplomatic steps i
were in progress today the Na r
tion was stirring throughout its J
width and breadth with the p

men mobilizing to guard the c
border. At least 100,000 and
possibly a far larger number P
were preparing for active ser- p
vice under President Wilson's
call. For the present their mis- r
sion purely will be one of de s
fense; but should war come, I
they will be ready also for that, t
The new forces will not be as h
signed for border duty until mus 1
tered into the Federal service, p
h^veh"when mobilization is com*"
pleted, only such units will be
Drdered South as General Funs- ,
>ton desires to fill the gaps in
tiis 1,800-mile guard line. The
remainder will rest on their
arms at the State mobilization
camps for the present, awaiting 0
the turn of events. "
'
vmtidi iepuris irom many ^
quarters show that a flame of
popular feeling: against the Uni- a
ted States is being kindled
through Mexico, apparently with ^
[he sanction of General Carran ^
sa for the acts in many cases ^
ire those of his authorized military
or civil agents.

sent it from Washington. It \v4|
inderstood that the plank shoi^

vay he had drawn it.
There never was any doqb!

I
ion tonight, but there was 3i
jossibilitv that some vice presb,
lential booms might he broughf

iway, however, when the coc$
mention got in session and ajf"
oon as President Wilson's notn$
nation had been made by a
oaring chorus of acclamation}
Jenator Kern, who renominated
dr. Marshall, cast aside a lonj|
irepared speech and simply deb
:lared;
"I nominate Thomas Riletf
Marshall of Indiana for vi<j|?

To President Wilson's nonuf 1

cratic National Convention fin. I
shed its work today bv adopting
lie party platform exactly as ap !
roved by President Wilson and
ubmitted by the resolutions
ommittee, including the plank (
?n Americanism and that favor g
woman suffrage, but not un
il the harmony of its three days
essions had been disturbed with '
row over the suffrage plank.
No voice was raised against J
lie vigorous declarations of the
Vmericanism plank, but at one 5
ime it looked as if the suffrage '
lank had been lost. After Sen- '
tor Walsh of Montana had told '
lie convention that President '
Vilson himself considered it vi- 5
il to party success, however, it *
/as voted into tne platform by ballot
of 888 1-2 to 181 12. i
"he entire platform then was 1
dopted without roll call. J
The plank on Aincriconis.il ]
ondemns the activities of all 1
ersons, groups and organizaons
in the United States that J
onspire to advance the interests (
f a foreign Dower. (
Thorough preparedness on
md and sea against unexpected
tvasion and the joining ot the ^
Inited States with other nations
> "assist the world in securing
ittled peace and justice" are 1
rged.
On the Mexican question, the "
latform asserts that American '
oops should remain in Mexico a
ntil the restoration of law and f
rder there, and asserts that in F
jrvention is "revolting" ir? iti?? e
tiople ot the United States. *
Other p'anks declare for a

Foresight
A farmer was the father of
welve children, all of whom
tad been rocked in the same
:radle. He was rocking the
lowest arrival one evening
vhen ins wife remarked:
"John, that cradle is nearly
vorn out; it's so rickety I'm
[raid it will fall to pieces."
"It is about used up," her luis
and agreed. Then handing her
en dollars, he added: "The next
ime you go to town get a new
>ne, a good one> one that will
iist."
No Hurry
An Arkansas stork raiser was
howing his friend from the
sTorth the splendid plantation
^hich he owned.
After they had returned to the
louse and were sitting on the
eranda puffing contentedly on
leir cigars, the Northerner
aid:
"Instead of letting those razor
uck hogs run wild as vou do.
,hy don't you put them in a
en and feed them some of the
orn vou raise? Don't vou think
ley'd net fat much quicker?"
"They might," replied the
lanter; "but what is time to a
og?"
