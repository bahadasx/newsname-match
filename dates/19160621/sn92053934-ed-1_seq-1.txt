Pershing IM-ries Mpx Threat.
San Antonio. Texas. June 21. Gen
eral Pershing has given the Mexican
troops the opportunity to make good
their threat to attack h;m if he moved
east or west, but the Mexicans declin
ed the issue.
He sent a small force eastward to
Guzman, about 35 miles from his line
of communication, yesterday to inves

IOWA TROOPS ARE
MOVING SLOWLY
Officials Believe Spvpral Mnrp Pays
Will Be 'peessarj for Complete
Mobilization.
lies Moines, Iowa, June 21. It ap
peared today that several more days
may elapse before concentration of the
Iowa national guard at Camp Dodge
near here is ordered by the adjutant
general. Reports reaching the guard
headquarters from all sections of the
state were to effect that virtually ev
ery enlisted man is under arms and is
waiting for the mobilization call.
In the larger cities today regimental
surgeons are putting the men through
the required examinations. It was
conisdered likely that this process
may further slightly delay the mob
ilization. The men, it was said, would
have to undergo investigation at the
hands of the government surgeons be
fore being mustered in as volunteers
and the guard doctors were trying to
expedite this process by weeding out
the manifestly unfit before going to
the camp. A score of men were dis
charged from one local company to
day. The majority were under weight.
Company commanders have recruiting
officers at work trying to replace the
discharged members with men whose
physique comes up to the federal
standard.
It was said at the adjutant general's
office today that orders for mobiliza
tion of the guard probably would not
be issued until word had been received
from regimental commanders that
their units were recruited to minimum
peace strength and ready to take the
tield.
FURNITURE FIRM IS
FACING INDICTMENT
; Memphis. Tenn., Jan. 21. The fed
'eral grand jury has indicted on nine
'counts the Memphis Furniture com
, pany, charging that during the year
! 1914 the defendant corporation
' shipped in interstate traffic several
carloads of rugs and mattresses from
Memphis to points in Arkansas and
i Missouri, and in order to secure a
' cheaper railroad rate described the
cars as containing furniture. Furni
, ture, the indictment recites, takes a
! much cheaper rate than rugs. The
case will be tried in Judge McCall's
court in Xovember. The maximum
penalty on each count is $5,000. The
indictment came as a result of an in-
1 vestigation conducted by the inter
state commerce commission.

DESIRE FOR WAR
reoplc .Not Afraid to Fipht Hnt Too
Busy With Greater Things, De
Clares Secretary Ijanc.
Providence, R. I., June 21. The
American spirit is against war not be
cause Americans are afraid to fight
but because they are too busy with
other enterprises more important than
war. Franklin K. Lane, secretary of
the interior, declared in a commence
ment address at Brown university to
day. The degree of doctor of laws was
conferred on the secretary. Charles
E. Hughes, republican nominee for
president, was anothc- honor guest.
"The spirit of America is against
war not because we have grown cow
ardly and fear death," said Mr. Lane,
"nor because we have grown flabby
and love softness, nor even because
we have become conscious converts to
the Prince of Peace. But we in Amer
ica have something larger to do. We
are discovering our country. We have
no time for war. We are doing some
thing so much more important We
are at work. That is the greatest of
all adventures. When war comes to a
democracy it comes because we are
not allowed peacefully to work.
"What would we fight for? For what
Roger Williams fought for to be let
alone, to have the opoprtunity to show
what man can do for man."

Mason, former American consul gen
eral, died here today. He was 7S years
old.

THE WAR TODAY
While the weight of German
military power is being increas
ingly felt on the eastern front,
where it has stiffened the Austri
an resistance to the Russians'
drive the pressure on the French
at Verdun has momentarily less
ened. There has been rather live
ly artillery activity around the fa
mous western front fortress, but
no further moves by the infantry
are recorded in this afternoon's
Paris I111 1 let in.
The Germans have not been al
together idle on this front, how
ever, for after hating touched off
two mines northwest of Rheims, a
district in which the deadlock of
the armies has been just about as
complete as anywhere along the
line, they attacked French
trenches on a height south of
Berry-Au-Bac. Paris declares the
defensive curtain of tire caused the
assault to fail completely.
Athens dispatches fore-cast
changes in the Greek cabinet as a
result of the economic pressure
which the allies have exerted be
cause of dissatisfaction with the
Greek government's attitude.
Resignation of the cabinet of
Premier Skouloudis is expected in
some qearterg. Former Premier
Zaimis may be asked to form a
ministry acceptable to the entente.
The Austrian, their army cut
in two, are in disorderly retreat
with the Russians pursuing them
toward the Carpathian mountains,
according to Petroirrad. The Rus
sians have crossed the river Screth,
southwest of Czemowitz and have
occupied three towns.
Both the Russians and the Ger
mans claim successes for their
arms between the Pripet river and
the Galician frontier, though both
official report!) say lighting in the
region has been severe.
In Galiria in the vicinity of
Buczaoz, Austrlans and Germans
are desperately resisting Rnssian
attempts to advance on Lemhurg.
In the Verdun region, bombard
ments have been going on around
Fort Vaux, but no marked progress
has been made by either of the bel
ligerents. The Anstrians and Italians are
engaged In attacks and counter at

ARSENAL GATE
French Hold
Teut Charge
by Gun Fire
Paris, June 21, (11:50 a,, m.) A vio
lent attack on the French positions
northwest of Rheims was made by the
Germans last night at Hill No. 10S and
in the direction of Berry-Au-Bac, ac
cording to an official statement issued
by the war office today. The attack
was repulsed by the French artillery
fire.
The Germans exploded two mines be
fore launching their infantry against
the French trenches. Their repulse
was due, the statement savs. to the
effectiveness of the French screen fire.
In the Verdun sector no infantry
action was reported but a mutual bom
bardment was maintained during the
night.
The text of the statement follows:
"South of the Somme, before Mau
court, a detachment of the enemy
which attempted to -approach our lines
was dispersed with rifle fire.
".Northwest of Rheims the Germans,
after exploding two mines, delivered
an attack against tl.e trenches at Hill
10S, south of Berry-Au-Bac. Checked
by our curtain of fire, this attack was
defeated completely.
"On both banks of the Mense (Ver
dun front) our artillery and that of
the enemy were rather active during
the night."

ence May Be Called Off at In
ability of Members to Attend.
Portland, Ore., June 21. Develop
ments today indicated that the Fifth
annual west governors' conference
scheduled to be held in Salt Lake City,
June 2H, would be postponed. Gov
ernor James Withyeombe of Oregon,
secretary of the conference, has an
nounced that because of the Mexican
situation he would be unable to at
tend. Governor Withyeombe received
today a telegram from M. C. Riley of
Madison, Wis., secretary of the na
tional governors' conference which is
scheduled to meet at Salt Lake City at
the same time asking if the western
executives had abandoned their meet
ing. It was slated at the office of
Governor Withyeombe that both or
ganizations would take a poll of their
members and tha if only a small num
ber could attend a postponement of
the two conferences probably would
be announced shortly. Governor Ern
est Lister of Washington, the presi
dent, stated today that he also could

NO WORD RECEIVED
Not Known How American
Message Is Received at
Mexican Capital
Washington, June 21.
Special Agent Rodger 5 at
Mexico City telegraphed the
state department today that,
the American note had
reached there and wa being
considered by General Car
ranza and his cabinet He
made no mention of how it
was received.
Eagle Pass, Texas, June
General Murgia, a Carranza com
mander, arrived at Piedras "e- ,
gras, the Mexican town opposite
here today with a detachment ot
2.000 Taqnis, reinforcing the gar
rison there. A large part of the
civilian population of Piedras Ne
gras has already moved sooth.
Wasington, June 21. Strom?
pressure is being brought to bear
npon General Carranza by repre
sentatives of European powers to
prevent him from forcing a break
witli the I'nited States. Indirect
reports reaching the state depart.
' ment today told of -thes -effort
and said there was a possibility
they would be successful.
The United States today anxiously
awaited word from Mexico City re
garding General Carranza's attitude
toward the American note.
High officials here admitted private
ly they look for war, although avoid
ing any formal expressions Indicating
forerunners of a declaration of war.
The only answer required from Car
ranza is action suppressing outlaw i
treatment of Americans. The official '
text may already be in Carranza's ;
hands.
The war department was getting ;
ready today to act on General Funs
ton's request for immedia;e dispatch;
of a number of national gnaid units to
the border. Secretary Baker and Pres
ident Wilson probably will determine
what organizations should be sent.
Several days may elapse before any1
great number of militia units can be
mustered into the federal service.
Beady for Emergency.
In case Mexicans attack the Ameri
can column a general rapid advance
probably would be ordered from the
border to a line perhaps 100 or more
miles south of the border. This line
then would be fortified and held until
volunteer reinforcements become
available. Thus fighting would be
thrown into the enemy's" territory and
the border protected against further
bandit attacks by thorough policing of
the country behind the main line.
Five Americans Hiding.
El Paso, Tex June 2L Five Ameri
cans are hiding in the mountains near
Parral in southern Chih.uah.ua, fearing
to attempt to make their way to the
border, because of the feeling of the
natives, according to reports reaching
here today. The men, employes of the
Alvarado Mining and Milling company
of Parral, recently started toward El
Paso but were obliged to seek refuge
in the hill country. In the party are
T. G. Hawkins, Jr., A. W. Morris, R. C.
Higley, H. A. Buick and H. W. Col
lins. Company officials here expressed
no great fear for their safety, assert
ing that Mexican friends could be de
pended upon to afford them protection.
With the exception of these five, the
exodus of Americans from Chihuahua
was practically complete today, with
the arrival of the eight remaining
members of the colony in Chihuahua
City. All of them told of food shortage
and increasing anti-American senti
ment El Paso people hairing heavy hold
ings in Mexico were interested in dis
patches from Mexico City which said
in substance that a decree had been
issued by the de facto government,"
holding that any foreigner acquiring
real estate in Mexico, either by pur
chase or contract, must renounce first
his allegiance to his native country and
register himself as a Mexican citizen.
It further ordered that any person
seeking to transfer his property to a
foreigner must obtain permission from
the proper authorities.
Border Sentiment Taut.
Border sentiment at times during the
day seemed taut, almost to the Knap
ping point and at others lapsing into a.
patient wait for news oC Carracza's
reception of the American note. Per
sistent rumors were thick again hi El
Paso that scouting patrols of General
Pershing's expeditionary command had
been attacked south of Namiqulpa by
Carranzista forces but General George
Hell, Jr.. commanding the military dis
trict, said his dispatches did not aup
port tbxte rumor, .
