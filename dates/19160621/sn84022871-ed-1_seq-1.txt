"Turning the B3ck on God," was
the morning subject. For 6,000 years
man has been climbing upward until
today he stands upon a plane far above
the wildest dreams of his fathers. Old
systems have been left behind and new
ones inaugurated, in spite of all the
changes that the world has witnessed,
there is only one save God, that re
mains unchanged, and that is human
nature. The so-called modern man
may find his counterpart in the men of
other days. Today men turn their
backs on the church and in doing so
turn it on God. If you are outside the
church is not your influence against it
and God? 'lhen you may be a member
of the church, whose uniform has be
come so faded that its original color
can hardly be distinguished. Is God
and his cause uppermost in your mind?
Are other things more attractive than
the services of God's house? Where do
you go when all restraints are off?
Honestly answer these questions and
you will be able to tell if your back is
turned against God. History shows
that the nations which have turned
their backs on God are forgotten or
only a memory ; they have gone down
to ruin and lost their former glory.
The religion cf Jesus Christ shows man
how little he is ; tells him that he is a
sinner. Men dislike things that make
them appear small in their own eyes.
The Bible is God's mirror and few of
us care to gaze upon our own reflec
tion. All men worship something and
if not God we build an altar and wor
ship something else. Man has a spirit,
a soul, and not until this comes into
contact with Jesus Christ can man
really grow.
The subject for the evening talk was
"The Christian Proposal," the text
being, "Come with us and we will do
thee good." The spirit of true Chris
tianity is to tell the good news, to do
others good. The religion of the Bible
is one of promise, where the heathen
religions were built on threats. Chris
tianity is pre-eminently a religion
which serves all those who come under
its influence. It says, "Come with us
and we will do thee good," and the in
vitation is to all nations and peoples.
Don't forget the food sale, held at
the church vestry, Saturday afternoon,
June 24th, at 3 p. m., by the Epworth
League. Salads, pies and cakes will
be for sale and your patronage will be
appreciated.
Fully 400 people were present at the
closing session of the Orleans and Cal
edonia County Christian Endeavor
Union convention held at Greensboro
Sunday afternoon, when Governor
Charles W. Gates delivered a half-hour
address on Vermont. He gave a brief
history of the state, told of the noble
achievements of her sons and daugh
ters in the past and predicted a great
future if they were prepared in a moral
sense. He pointed to the work of vari
ous state institutions and told of the
splendid work they were doing to make
honorable men and women. Governor
Gates, himself a Christian Endeavorer
for more than 15 years, inspired his
listeners with a determination to live
nearer the ideal set for them by the
principles of the organization.
The audience filled the Greensboro
Congregational church to its doors and
even wTith chairs would not seat all the
people, - some listening through open
windows. Following Governor Gates,
Rev. W. E. Baker of Monisville gave
an eloquent address which held his au
dience thrilled. He closed with a plea
for preparedness.
The Sunday forenoon session was
nearly as wTell attended as the after
noon meeting, there being fully 300
persons at this service. Rev. R. P.
Anderson of Boston, associate editor of
the Christian Endeavor World, spoke
on "The Two-fold Promise of Christian
Endeavor." Mr. Anderson i3 a man
of wide travel and experience and his
straight message for Christian En
deavor principles of training and serv
ice were listened to
ers who must have
return to tbeir own
into practice the
Christian Endeavor.
More than 200 people were served at
dinner by the Greensboro people in the
church vestry and in Grange hall and
certainly the closing mass meetings
on Sunday were the culminating events
of one of the most enthusiastic Chris
tian Endeavor conventions this part of
the state has experienced for several
years.
The convention opened Friday even
ing with devotional exercises and an
address by Rev. W. E. Baker which
was full of the enthusiasm this speaker
always puts into his efforts and which
in turn is caught up by ins hearer.
His subject was. "Life, a Career or a
Mission."
On Saturday morning an early morn
ing devotional service was held, led by
Rev. C. A. Adams ot Danville and a
similar service on Sunday morning was
led by Rev. C. E. Garvin of East
Craf tsbury. Those who assisted in
other praise or devotional services
were Rev. L. A. Edwards of Newport,
