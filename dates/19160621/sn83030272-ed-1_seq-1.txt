bukes First Chief for Jn-
WASHINGTON', June 20. Gon. Funston wirctl the War Depart
ment to-rlny asking that a force of Nntionnl Gunrrismcn to total (55,000
be sent to him as soon as they arc available.
The request is understood to have been based on disturbing reports
which have reached Gen. Funston'.i headquarters conccrninp; the activity
of Mexican forces south of tho border.
. A few hours previous to the receipt of this message in Washington.
. Secretary I.ansini? had delivered to Eliseo Arredondo. Mcxicnn Ambassador-Designate,
one of the sharpest notes ever addressed by one Govern
ment to another.
This note was the formal reply of the United States to the threaten
ing note sent to Washington by the Carranzii Government on May 22
demanding an immediate withdrawal of the American forces from
Mexico. The American reply, which was matle public, flatly rejects tho
demand and serves notice on Cnrranza that "grave consequences" will
result from any attack on American forces.
' , Major-Gen. Uliss, Assistant Chief of Staff, and Adjt.-Gen. McCain
- were in conference late to-night concerning the Funston request for
' National Guardsmen. It is understood that inquiries will bo sent to the
. Governors of the States asking how much time will be needed for their
troops to mobilize.
When the conference broke up it was intimated that the President
I himself probably would decide on the number of National Guardsmen to
go to the border and select the States from which they would be sent.
In his message to the War Department Gen. Funston did not specify
the total number that he required, but designated the various kinds of
organizations, such as infantry, cavalry und field urtillery. that he needed.
The selections, it was indicated, would probably be announced to
morrow after a conference between the President and the Secretary of
War.
Following the conference between Gens. Uliss and McCain, Secretary
American Consul Tioinas r IMwai.is Baker, who had been summoned to the White House by the message
