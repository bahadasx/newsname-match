Washington. D. C, June 21.
Strong pressure is being
brought to bear on Carranza by

1 Jnited States. Indirect reports
reaching the state department
today told of these enoris ana
said there was a possibility
ihat thpv'd be successful.
Agencies of the entente al
lies are believed to be working
for this end, and they believe
that German influences have
been responsible for the inflam
ing of the Mexicans against uie
United States.
The United States today an
xiouslv waits word from Mex
ico City regarding Carranza s
attitude toward the American
note sent yesterday, for on him
depends war between tne two
vpnuhlins.
High official's admitted pri
vately that they looked ior
war. The only answer Carran
za can make, is action in sup
pressing the outlaw treatment
of Americans, and officials
feared against hope that this
would not be done.
It was pointed out today
that Carranza might call an in
ternational commission to dis
cuss the border situation, under
the treaty of 1848, and avert
war, but different reports come
from the first chief, who is said
to be doing all in his power at
this time to protect Americans
and prevent hostilities.

PROBABILITY THAT TWO ADDI
TIONAL REGIMENTS WILL BE
CALLED FOR FROM THIS STATE
HUTCHINSON GETS LETTER.
Ardmore may have the opportunity
of furnishing a company for service
on the border, as there Is a strong
probability of recruiting two more reg
iments in the state, and in that event
Ardmore and Cartur county would
furnish at least 150 men for the or
ganizations. Captain Hutchinson, former captain
of Company G, located in tills city, re
ceived a letter from Colonel Hoffman
this morning, asking if he thought it
possible that Ardmore could furnish
a company in the event it became nec
essary. Captain Hutchinson answered
in the affirmative instantly, and his
office will be open in the Guaranty
State bank building where all infor
mation will be obtainable relative to
the proposed company.
It would be no trouble to raise a
company, or 'perhaps two of them,
right here in Ardmore, and there are
many in Carter county who would
gladly respond to the call to put an
end to the Mexican nuisance that has
caused so much trouble during the last
few years.
Captain Hutchinson will keep in
communication with the authorities
and Will be in position to state defi
nitely what Is required within the
next few days. Some of the old of
ficers of Company G, formerly located
here, are on the supernumerary list
and are subject to assignment in any
company anywhere in the state.
Among these are Doc Hayes and
Will "Worley. They, however, have
received no communcation from head
quarters as yet, but are expecting
one at any time. j
BE MORE CAREFUL WITH
GLASS, NAILS AND TACKS.
There Js a well defined roar going
up from motorists all over the city
for the careless manner in which
builders allow old shingles and lum
ber filled with nails to accumulate
on the streets where building opera
tions are in progress there increasing
the number of punctured tires in the
city many fold.
The automobile association may file
a written protest with the city com
missioners if the practice Is not dis
continued as the danger from this
cause is making tire repair men work
overtime.
There is another practice that the
police are watching, very closely and
the first one caught in the act will
pay a heavy fine, and that Is the prac
tice of smashing glass on the pave
ments. Glass is a serious menace to
pneumatic tires and the first indivi
dual who is caught smashing a bottle
or any other glass article on the
street will be made an example of.

United States.
Storm Causes Suicide.
Cluckasha, Okla., June 20. Joe
Rogers, a farmer, committed suicide
last night at the home of a relative
five miles south of Verden by cutting
his throat with a pocket knife. Fear
that he was going to be swept away
by a tornado is supposed to have
caused the act. Members of the
family with which he was staying ran
to a cave for protection from wind
storm. Rogers remained behind and
when the family found him he was
dead on the porch of the house. Rog
ers dreaded storms and was always
afraid that he would be carried away
by one. He was 32 years old.
BANKERS WILE
WITH A NEW HOTEL ASSURED,
THE BANKERS DECIDED TO
HOLD NEXT ANNUAL CONVEN
TION IN THIS CITY. .
As a result of the practical assur
ance of a modern hotel in Ardmore
the next meeting of the State Cank
ers Assurance is a strong probability,
according to P. C. Dings, who is a
member of the executive committee
of the association who has just re
turned from a meeting in Oklahoma
City.
"The committee wanted to select'
the place and date of meeting yes
terday," said Mr. Dings, "but when I
told them we wanted them to come
to Ardmore and that we had a hotel
deal pending, the committee gracious
ly consented to put off the naming
of the place until September, so I
could formally assure them of a ho
tel. If the deal goes through we will
have twelve hundred bankers and
their families here next May."

the hotel committee and one of the
trustees of the fund put renewed en
ergy in the committee whe are solicit
ing subscriptions to the stock for the

MODE OF CITY

TALK OF AMENDING THE CHAR

ELECTIVE OFFICERS AND PAY

fail the citizens are going to have the
matter to decide before another in
coming administration takes hold of
affairs. The proposed change briefly
stated is as follows:
To have three commissioners elec
ted by the people, one of whom will
act as mayor, to pay two of the com
missioners $1,800 annually and the
Chairman of the board, or the mayor,
which ever he be designated not less
than $2,100. These three men would
be charged with the management of
every department of the city govern
ment, would hire and fire every man
connected in any capacity from Uie

in other words to bo the three men,e,g anJ Canuto Reyeg are ex
who decide all matters for the period) ted Chihuahua shortly,
of their term of office which is sug
gested to be four years instead of
two 'years. This is bordering closely
upon the city, manager plan or the
Dayton idea so called because Dayton
was the first city to adopt the plan,
and would forever eliminate politics
from municipal affairs. .
The three commissioners would be
supposed to give their entire time to
their office and should be men of
enough business capacity to handle a
seven million dollar corporation as
that Is what Ardmore at the present
time represents. In discussing the
salary question one prominent busi
ness man stated that in his opinion
the above figures were too low, that
such men should be the best business
men available and they could not be
secured for such an amount as set
forth above. As an Illustration he
cited Dayton where the manager re
ceives a salary of $12,000 per year,
however, the salary question could
easily be arranged if the charter is
amended to fit the Ideas advanced.
The question has been quietly agi
tated by a few people for some time
and Is gradually meeting with popular
favor by all who have given the mat
ter any thought. The salaries of the
city officials at present under the
charter now In force are a joke, yet
the citizens seem to think that the
commissioners should give their en
tire time and manage a seven million
dollar corporation for $Zo.w per
month.
BANK WILL MOVE ITS
