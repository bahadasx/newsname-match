D. C. MILITIA TURNS
OUT FOR SERVICE FOR
FIRST TIME
Two Thousand Washington Fighting Men
March Up Avenne to War Camp One
of the First Organizations' to Respond
to President's Call.
For the first time since '98, Washington's fighting men
in full war regalia paraded through the city today.
Starting from the armory at 1:18 o'clock, 2,000
sons of the District of Columbia swung briskly into New
York avenue, headed by Brig. Gen. William E. Harvey, and
the long hike to the war camp was on.
Just a little later the guardsmen went by the War De
partment, coming to the salute as they passed in review be
fore the President of the United States and the Secretary of
War.
Thus did the Capital answer the call of the Chief Ex
ecutive with one of the first guard organizations of the en
tire country to complete its mobilization and report for duty.
.. The two thousand men who marched behind their lead
er in parade before the President and his war chief came
near setting a record for national guard efficiency. .
Fully equipped for the field and ready to keep on the
march to whatever point the President chose to send them,
they reported for duty within three days of the receipt of
the President's call for their services.
With their bands playing and their flags flying they
marched steadily out of private life and into the life of a
soldier. They represented the infantry, cavalry, artillery,
and signal corps with all of the necessary supply and san
itary troops.
General Harvev marched at the head of the District
troops for the reason that at the last hour the original orders
for the mobilization of the District guardsmen were amend
ed to include its commanding officer. Up to 1 1 o'clock this
morning Col. Glendie B. Young, commanding the Third
Infantry, was in command of the troops.
There was considerable rejoicing at national guard
headquarters when General Harvey walked in just before
noon, fully uniformed and equipped for the- field, and an
nounced that the War Department had assigned him to
active duty.
He was immediately surrounded by staff officers and
officers of the Third Infantry to present their congratula
tions. The first man to greet the commanding general was
Col. Glendie B. Young, who is thus deprived of a large com
mand. MEN START OFF ON LONG MARCH.
Tho start of the men from tho various
armories waa made at 1:11. Tho
Third Infantry, at tho L stroet
armory, was assembled this morn
ing at 8 o'clock, and their duty as
soldiers may bo said to have commenced
at that time, for thoy wore not again
dismissed.
Just beforo noon tho men wero march
ed to tho open space botween Conven
tion Hall and tho Armory building,
where lunch was served, the first meal
as soldiers being prosaic ham sand
wiches and coffeo, which MaJ, John E.
Whltaker had prepared for them.
Immediately after tho meal had been
concluded thn bugles sounded assembly,
und the battalions formed In the street
facing the armory. All the baggage and
camp equipment tho men do not carry
on their persons had been forwarded to
enmp on nagons.
At 1:18 o'clock General Harvey, with
Adjt. Gen. Harry Coopc, and the other
officers of his start, rode to the head
of the regiment, and the order "for
ward" was sounded with two short notes
of the trumnot.
The troops marched out Now York avo-

No Gilt or Glitter.
The parade of tho troops was a busi

traditional gilt or glitter or tho military
about them. The men marched In their
shirt sleeves, and tho equipment and
pack that was slung across their shoul
ders appeared to bo for real business
rather than for ornament.
Many stirring scenes were enacted at
