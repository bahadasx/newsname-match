THREATENED HOSTILE ACT
MILITIA 10 BE
BY END OF WEEK
WASHINGTON, June 21 Barker
ill not order the militia to the bor
der today because mobilization is in
complete. It Is doubtless If the men
will be enroute before the end of the
week. What state's militia will be
called first depends upon its readiness.
Undoubtedly more than 00.000 men
are going.
A method for calling for volunteers
has not been arranged. This only
will be done when developments re
quire it. Reports that the adminis
tration intends to ask for a half mil
lion volunteers appear to be exagger
ated. An order for a navy blockade of
Mexican ports is expected soon. Of
ficials said It would be comparatively
easy to blockade Mexico. Eut the
population already Is near starvation
nd the putting into effect of a real
blockade would meaif further suffer
ing. Therefore officials are determin
ed to go slowly. Ileal action will not
co rut for several weeks.
Tne militiamen must be given time
to become acclimated It is expected
that after they reach the border a per
iod of waiting will follow while Car
ranza Is given a final chance.
The majority of the lOO.OOO militia
men now mobilizing will begin to move
to the border immediately after mobl
Illation is complete if the railroads are
able to carry them. They will be dis- j
trlbuted along the border from the
Gulf of California immediately, releas
ing the entire force of regulars for an
actual invasion of Mexico if war is de
clared. The reserve militia will be
stationed at Fort Huston.

FIGHT BREWING ON PLAN
TO LICENSE PEDLERS HERE
REMONSTRANCE TO BE M IDE TO
COUNCIL AGAINST PRO.
POSED ORDINANCE,
A stiff fight is to be made against
the proposed ordinance for the licen
sing of professional peddles In Pen
dleton, according to report. It is un
derstood that a remonstrance with
over 300 signatures will be presented
to the council this evening.
The remonstrance is said to be
signed by restaurant men, residents
and others who patronize peddlers.
Advocates of the ordinance express
the belief that many of these signers
have a wrong impression of the Intent
of the ordinance, believing It to be
aimed at all persons who peddle re
gardless of whether they produce
their products or not.
One of the councilmen stated today
that he had been advised that the pro
ducers' association of Milton and Free
water have employed Walla Walla at
torneys to fight any such ordinance as
Pendleton contemplates passing.
The Gilbert and Elllce Islands in
the Pacific ocean, which were pro

K.mplre as a crown colony The pop

In 1911 to be 26.3m natives and 416
foreigners.
