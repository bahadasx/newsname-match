WoM was anxibusly awaited today
from M«fico City regarding General
Carranza's. altitude toward the Aimeri^
can note sent him yesterday, for on
him depended the question of war be
tween -the two republics. High offi
cials here admitted privately they
$1 looked

for war.
The only answer required from Gen
eral Carranza is action suppressing
outlaw treatment of Americans, and
officials feared against hope that this
would not be done.
Unofficial versions of the note Prob
st* ably were published.in Mexico City to-
day- and the official text probably is
already in General Carranza's hands.
Military authorities were looking for
'IS. the de facto government's attitude in
Mexico threatening troop movements

"M' tion for these the war department was
if" ready in response to General Funston's
request to dispatch guardsmen to the
border. j|
|p|' Great Enthusiasm Among Guards.
Reports of great enthusiasm and
rapid recruiting continue to come in
from many states today.
fei Great interest was expressed In the
probable course to -be followed In
case the Mexicans attack the Amerl
can column. It is probable a general
advance would be ordered to a line
100 miles south of the border. This
line then would be fortified find held
until volunteer troops would be avail
able. Thus fighting would be thrown
into the enemy's territory and the
border protected against further
bandit attacks by thorough policing of
the country behind the main line.

Would Need More For Invasion.
General Funston's request for the
guardsmen was for "a number suffi
cient to give adequate protection to
the border." Officials at his headquar
ters also felt that with this increased
force operations in Mexico on a big
scale might be undertaken,^but In the
event of intervention or any other ac
tion making necessary a general for
ward movement into Mexico, General
Funston explained that he would asK
immediately for the remainder of the
100,000 guardsmen called to service this

from Petrograd .today. When the Aus
trians retired from Ozernowitz, tlfa
correspondent says, part of them Re
treating due south along the Rou

Carpathians, their hope was to have
time to hold the Russians on the for

the rivers Mikhodra and Sereth. But
despite the delay caused by the de
fense of Czernowitz General Letchitz
sky threw his reserves upon the heels
of the retreating Austrians at such

The result was that General Pflan

between Kuty and Sereth, at Stroginet.

State's Attorney Acoused of Conniv­
ing to Get Confession From Orpet.
Waukegan, 111., June 21.—Judge Don
nelly was still unprepared when court
opened today to rule on the com
petence or incompetence as evidence of
the earlier letters 'of«Will OVpot to
Marian Lambert for whose alleged
murder he is on trlai.
The defense objected" to the admis
sion of the earlier letters as having
no bearing on Marian:s death. Judge
Donnelly speaking to the lawyers be
fore the jury came in, said that the let
ters were so prejudicial to Orpet as
plainly indicating seduction that It
would be dangerous tp give them to
the Jury,
*1 have read the letters," the court
said, "and they affected me. The ef
fect on the jury may be imagineu.
They might not draw the distinction
that they are trying the defendant for
murder and murder alone."
State's Attorney Dady argued for
their admission on the grounds that an
illicit love affair culminating in murder
could be shown only by reading the
entire series of letters and epistles.
The citations of authorities consumed
an hour.
Friganza Recalled.
Everett Friganza, a newspaper re
porter who had various interviews with
Orpet, was recalled to the stand.
"Orpet told me that he met Mariar.
inHelms wood to tell her their friend
ship had ceased—that he was thru,"
the witness said. "He said they walked
together. Shes topped and he walked
on. When he looked back she had
fallen in the sncw."
Friganza, in a talk with Orpet on
the train from Madison to Lake Forest
asked Orpet if he were engaged to
Celeste Youkers.
"He said they were practically en
gaged," related the witness., "He asked
me not to drag her name into the case.
He admitted that hes relations with
Marian were illicit, he said, 'it was a
cold proposition—1 never told her I
loved her—I never said I would marry
her.'"
After Orpet was In Jail Friganza said
he found it hard to reach Orpet and
had himself arrested and put in Jail
with Orpet on Feb. 20.
At this point Attorney Potter of the
defense objected.
"We have information," said Potter,
"that the state's attorney connived
with the witness to get him into jail to
obtain Orpet's confidence." "Over
ruled," said the court.
"In the jail," continued the witness,

Doctors Putting Guardsmen Thru Med

Militiamen Are Mobilized.""
Des Moines. June 21.—It appears to
day that several days may elapse before
concentration of the I. N. G. at Camp
Dodge, near here, is ordered by the ad
jutant general. Reports received at
headquarters from all parts of the state
were to the effect thut all enlisted men
are under arms and waiting for the
mobilization call.
In the large cities today regimental
surgeons were putting the enlisted men
thru the required physical examination,
It was considered likely that this pro
cess may further slightly delay the
tnobilizfttion. The men. It was said,
would have to undergo investigation at
the hands of the government surgeons
before being mustered in as volunteers
and the guard doctors were trying to
expedite this process by weeding out
the manifestly unfit before going into
camp. A score of men were discharged
from one local company today. The
majority were underweight. Company
commanders have recruiting officers at
work trying to replace the discharged
members with men whose physical con
dition comes up to the federal stand
ard.
It vv£8 said at the adjutant general's
office today that orders for mobilization
of the guard would not be issued until
word came from regimental command
ers that their units were recruited to
minimum strength and ready to take
the field.
