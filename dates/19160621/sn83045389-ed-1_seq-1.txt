The Secretary of St.ite to the Secretary
of Foreign Relations of the Dfc
Facto Government of Mexico:
Fir,?I have read your communica
tion, which war? delivered to me on
May -1&16. under instructions of the
? nief executive of the de facto govern
? >e:it of Mexico, on the .subject of tho
presence of American troops in Mexico
territory, and I would be wanting in
candor if I did not. before making
anrwer to the a llcgbtious of fact and
the conclusions reached by your gov
ernment. express the surprise and re
' fro' which have bec-n caused this
f overr.ment by the discourteous tone
d temper of this last communication
,.f the de facto government of Mexico.
The government of the. United States
has viewed with deep concern ami in
creasing disappointment the progress
? ,f the revolution in Mexico. Con
tinuous bloodshed and disorders have
marked its progress For three years
the Mexican republic has been torn
with civil strife; the lives of Americans
and other aliens have been sacrificed;
vast properties developed by American
capital and enterprise have been de
stroyed or rendered nonproductive;
bandits have been permitted to roam
at will through tho territory con
tiguous to the United States, ar.d to
seize, without punishment or without
effective attempt at punishment, the
* property of Americans, while the lives
of citizens of the United States who
ventured to remain in Mexican terri
tory or to return there to protect their
interests have been taken, and in some
r ses barbarously taken, and the mur
derers have neither been apprehended
nor brought to justice. It would be
difficult to find in the annals of the
history of Mexico conditions more de
plorable than those which liavq existed
there during these recent years of
civil war

Retention in Richmond of the State

firely upon a conference, this morning
between military officials and Henry j

who has been delegated authority by
that body to handle all matters per

nouncing that the Magic City offers
for mobilization the same site used j
for the officers' training camp, and that ;
the peoplo and the Chamber of Com- j
inerce of that city are anxious to re- i

Potts, camp quartermaster, and Colonel
,T. Fred J^ynch, surgeon-general of the

spection of the work already accom
plished at. the Fair Grounds, and ex
pressed the opinion that preparations
were progressing slowly.

BY HKPORT OF OFFICIOUS
Action in the matter by the Adjutant- !
General will be. guided largely by the ;
report of the two officers. Th?y were
unanimous in the opinion that repre
sentatives of the military service
should arrange for a conference with
Mr. Beck this morning and make It |
plain that the board must get to work
quickly In completing arrangements j
for the camp, or another site would be [
selected.
Mr. Beck expressed surprise that |
there should be dissatisfaction with i
progress made by the city in getting i
the grounds Into shape for State gar- I
rison purposes, and said the board had i
lost no time in making preliminary j
arrangements, which are absolutely !
necess|ry before the beginning of ac- i
tive work. Preparations. he said,
would be In full swing to-day, and city

"The Engineering and Water Depart
ments have been going ahead vigorously
with their work. To facilitate progress
in installing lights and telephones, the
construction force of the Chesapeake
and Potomac Telephone Company has
been retained to assist Mr. Trafford.
Much of the actual work was done yes
terday. Men were engaged in surveying
sites arul digging trenches for the lay
ing of necessary pipe lines. To-day
everything will be in full swing, and
the camp will be roaily to receive all
the troops within a week or ten days."
JltH-h pressure has been brought upon
the State military authorities to curry
the troops for mobilization to Virginia
lieach, where is situated the State rifle
range, reatfy at an> time to care, for
as many men as are assembled. Should
the conference with Mr. Heck this
morning terminate unsatisfactorily, the
choice of General Sale for a site will
fall either upon the Norfolk place or
upon the ofllcers' training camp site
at ltoanoke.
Colonel Stern's telegram reads as fol
lows:

DIVISION OF TltOOPS |
General Funston did not announce |
how many men he has asked for, but i
it is known that he expects more than j
a division, and probably not loss than j
2$.000 men will be sent.
Already the border army, made up j
of regulars and the militiamen of
Texas. New Mexico and Arizona, com
prises more than 40,000.
Army officers here do not regard the
quiet prevailing all along the line to
day as indicative of any Improved con
ditions.
Reports continued to Indicate that
bandits are operating just south of the j
international line, and that new incur-J
slons may be expected at any time.
T. Tt. Belltran, Mexican consul-gen- j

through Texas, New Mexico and Ari
zona a proclamation calling on all ?
Mexicans to maintain "serene and tin
prejudiced attitude 1 it order not to com
plicate the situation "
The Quartermaster Department prob
ably will advertise to-morrow for bids
on horses and mules, for which the
army must pay, at tt?e prevailing
market price, more than $10,000,000.
Instructions that were received to-day
announced that the army was in the
market for 26.500 cavalry horses, 15.000,
artillery horses, {*.000 wheel mules, '
S.100 lead mules and S.000 pack mules.

In the. northern states the Mexican j
force was estimated nt approximately

within striking distance of General

Additional details about the bandit
