The general Mexican situation today !
is otherwise unchanged. The United I
States Is anxiously awaiting word from
Mexico City officials regarding Carranza's
attitude toward the American
note sent him yesterday, declining to
withdraw United States troops from below
the border, and warning him of
"grave consequences" if he carries out
his threats against the American soldiers.
for on Gen. Carranza depends the
possibility of war between the two republics.
In other words, another period of
"watchful waiting:" for the United
States government must now ensue.
Unofficial versions of the note are probably
published in Mexico City today,
and it is believed that the official text
probably is in the hands of Gen. Carranza
this afternoon.
Because of the Mexican situation the
House of Representatives today to<^k up
the army appropriation bill, with the understanding
that it will be given right of
way, and will be rushed to the Senate as
scon as possible. Measures of preparation
are being taken in other quarters, too.

warranted.
Is Protecting Americans.
A rteflnlte statement has been received
hat Gen. Carranza la doing all In hia
power at thla time to protect Amert ins
In Mexico from attack by the
.'Iexican populace. He la aaid to have
given Special Agent Rodgers In Mexico
City all the aid In his power in ar- j
ranging for tralna to carry American |
refugees from the interior to vera ltuz. i
In some quarters Here this was construed
as evidence that he is not bent
upon provoking hostilities.
Mr, Rodgers added that he and his
diplomatic associates in the Mexican ,
capital had been given every assuran?;e j
of safe conduct and protection on their j
trip to the coast if it became necessary
for them to leave. The corps of Arner- j
lean newspaper correspondents there j
has decided to remain with Mr. Rodgers
until such time as he may find it neces- j
sary to leave.
One overnight dispatch from Mr. ;
Rodgers, who is located at Mexico j
City, received at the department today J
says that arrangements have been sat- {
Isfactorily concluded for a special train (
to carry Americans and other foreign- j
era from the capital to Vera Cruz. He j
reiterated hope that it would start today.
Another message from Mr.
Rodgers said that a train leaving Mexico
City yesterday carried a special car |
with thirty American citizens, mostly j
women, to Vera Cruz. The refugees
should be in Vera Cruz today. It is j
believed that there are about 600 !
Americans at the Mexican capital.
Feeling Against Americans.
Tension everywhere in Mexico against !
America ny is keyed up, according to
United States consular and other official
dispatches received at the department.
No disturbances arc being
reported, however, and <V/nsul Guyant,
at Progreso. Mexico, reported that
there is no truth in the rumor that Gen. I
Alvarado. at that point, has declared j
war on the United States. ?
Only preliminary reports on the prog- '
ress of the mobilization of the National
Guard foi border patrol duty were received
today at the War Department,
but these were viewed as satisfactory. '
Marching orders for the National J
Guard organizations are oeing neiu up i
at the War Department, pending com- i
pletion of the mobilization of the state |
troops at the state camps. Just as soon
as a sufficient number of the guardsmen
have been mustered into the federal
service the War Department will
act on Gen. Funston's request of yesterday.

desires and the points to which he desires

The army appropriation bill, which
i* to be given the right of way in
the House and rushed to the Senate as
soon as possible, carries $157,000,000,
which Is $53,000,000 greater than the
present act, and amendments which are
being prepared for the measure to take
care of present army movements will
increase the amount by many millions.
The National Guard equipment, train
movements and other expenses necessitated
by the President's call will be
amply provided for in the present bill,
in the opinion of House members. It
is considered that this will be a better
plan than carrying the amount
later in ft deficiency appropriation bill.

May Make General Advance. a?
In case It becomes necessary to act m
in Mexico, as a preliminary step to an
occupation such as that hinted at in tii
Mr. Lansing's note, and pending the fr
organization of an army of the size th
such an undertaking would require, it m<
is regarded as possible that a general
advance fronp the border to a line
paralleling the head of Gen. Pershing's H
column at Xamiquipa might be under
taken. ,With American forces disposed w
along such a line, holding important ri
towns and strategic points from the
Pacific to the gulf coasts, there could
be no fear of serious hostilities at the an
border. Any advancing Mexican force
would be subject to attack from the in,
rear should it move northward of this ^
advanced line. Ba
There is no fear here for the safety
of Gen. Pershing and his men. The exact
disposition of the troops, even the ju
exact number now beyond the border, trj
constitute military secrets. There is ^e
reason to believe, however, that between
10,000 and 12,000 regulars are
posted at the advance camps or along
the line of communication. Jleiief #x- tv
peditions also are said to have been or- se
ganized also at various points, ready w
to dash forward in flank attacks on any
large Mexican force which might attempt
to assault Gen. Pershing's en- ol
trenched camps or cut him off from his st
border base of supplies. 1
Beady to Cover Pulpit Pass. tr
One column, with strong artillery ^
support, is said to be ready to cover
Pulpit Pass, the* military highway
through the mountains between the _
states of Chihuahua and Sonora and
through which the formidable Sonora *
garrisons might seek to strike at
Pershing's rear detachments.
It was pointed out that establishment
of a general line across Mexico south of j
Pulpit Pass would close that route to
hostile forces. Another argument advanced
in support of the plan of action
was that the various railroads could be
quickly repaired and made use of to
supply the troops, making it possible
to shift the entire scene of hostilities
on to Mexican soil.
Some officials believe .that with the
prompt repulse of any attack on i
American forces and the maintenance <
of a rigid watch over the supplies that I
enter the country, complete occupation T
could be carried out with little fighting
after the lapse of a few weeks, f
While roving bands of outlaws would
make vigilance essential it was thought T
organized resistance could be quickly
broken up as the advanced columns were
reinforced with volunteers and moved
slowly southward.
Secretary Baker at Capitol.
Secretary of War Baker conferred at
the Capitol today with Senator Chamberlain,
chairman of the military affairs
committee, regarding the Mexican
situation generally. The Secretary
announced afterward that he had not
discussed legislation at all and XpnatM
Chamberlain insisted that the Secre- |
tary had not asked for any legislative
action nor suggested any.
"Jt uas merely a personal visit."
Secretary linker said. "We talked
about the army and militia generally,
but no legislation of any kind was
considered."
Senator Chamberlain said that it still
u as the disposition of Congress to de- *r
lay action on a resolution to provide
for making the National Guard eligibl* *i"
f??r foreign service. One subject discussed
was the matter of handling the
militia after the various state organi- X
zations report to the War Department
for service. Some officials insist that
there must be some authorization given i
for the militia to serve with the army
either on the border or in foreign territory.

DRASTIC ACTION IS
OPPOSEDBY SOME
Representative of Carranza
Says Americans Want to'
Stay in Mexico.
. 1
Some Americans in Mexico "do not
approve any drastic action which they
do not consider justified." and some
have expressed a desire to stay in
Mexico, even if the United States declares
war. according: to the Mexican
ambassador designate of the Carranza
government here.
The Mexican embassy this afternoon
issued a statement, over the signature
of Ambassador Arredondo, which said:
"The confidential agent of the Mexican
government in Washington is in receipt
of a telegram from Mexico City,
stating that several American citizens,
who have property or employment in
the state of Tabasco, have called upon
Gen. Mujica, governor of the -above
mentioned state, and declared they have
no intention of leaving Tabasco, even
in case the United States should declare
war on Mexico, and they have further
stated they are not in accord with the
above policy, regardless of what the
circumstances may be."
Americans Guaranteed Safety.
'""The department of foreign affairs
has telegraphed to the governor of
^ Tabasco that the Americans referred to
may remain wunin 1 auauw s icuuwij
and that in the event of war they
will have every safeguard and guarantee
for their persons and property.
. and that the same guarantee will be
afforded all foreigners throughout the
country. The attitude of these Americans
is self-explanatory, and clearly indicates
that the good elements of the
American people in Mexico do not approve
any drastic action which they
do not consider justified.
"Another patriotic manifestation of
working men. women and boys, including
hundreds of school children, took
place yesterday afternoon, led by bands
of music. They marched in orderly
fashion through principal streets of the
capital and halted at the National
Palace, where they were addressed by
Mr. Carranza and other leaders in the
same tone and sentiment exhibited on
similar occasions this week. With the
exception of this absolute quiet pre
vailed throughout the city, and there
are no indications of excitement.
Thousands of Volunteers. .
"Next Sunday military instruction will
begin for thousands of volunteers in several
places throughout the country. First
Chief is receiving thousand^ of offers of
young men ready to Join the army. From
one place alone 8,000 miners offered to
enlist in a body, the only thing limiting
the number of volunteers being the supply
of arms and ammunition.
"It is reported that 110 molestation has
been suffered by foreigners and the police
are taking every precaution to prevent
anything which might harass foreigners.
"Reports received from Yucatan indicate
that the distribution of lands among Indians
and persons despoiled of them by
previous governments is well under way.
Gov. de la Huerta reports from Sonora
that a number of merchants have been deported
on account of illegal speculations
and depreciation of the government's currency."

are contained in a dispatch t6 the Star
from Petrogrrad today. When the Austrians
retired from Czernowitz, says the
correspondent, part of them retreating due
south along the Rumanian border and
others toward the Carpathians, their hope
was to have time to hold the Russians on
the fortified line running from Kuty
d*r*th ftlnnc ths Rivera Mikhodra
and Sereth. But, despite the delay
caused by the prolonged defense of
Czernowitz, Qen. Letchitzky threw his
reserves upon the heels of the retreating
Augtrians at such speed that he
succeeded in reaching that line simultaneously
with them.
The result was that Oen. Pflanzefs
forces were cut in half midway between
Kuty and Sereth, at Stroginet. This
report seems to be further borne out
by the Russian official statement that
the Russians have occupied three
I towns on the Sereth river, and the
admission in the Austrian communica>
tion that Russian troops have crossed

Send Beinforcements.
It is stated that the Austrians and
Germans have sent reinforcements to
the southwestern front from the Italian,
French and Balkan war zones, as well
as from the Pinsk and Baranovichi
i regions. The Germans arrived too late
i at the Lutsk front to relieve the AusI
trians, having reached this region three

drive.
Gen. Kaledines is pressing westward
to the south of Vladimir-Volynskt with
the intention of cutting his opponents'

Hussion Official Report.
The text of the statement follows:
"On several sectors of the front occupied
by the armies under Gen. Brussiloff
the enemy continues to make desperate
counter attacks.
"The enemy offensive, begun in the
vicinity of the village of Voronchine,
northeast of Kiselin, seven versts north
of the Lutsk-Vladimir-Volynski road,
supported by German troops recently
transported thither, has broken down
! under our fire.
"According to reports just received,
our troops, after a counter attack in the

southeast of the village of Rokatchi, repulsed
the enemy and captured sixteen
officers, 1,200 men and eight machine
guns.
"In this decisive action the clever
handling of a Russian rifle battalion,
which took the enemy by both flank and
front, is particularly mentioned. This
battalion, forming part of a crack rifle

flight, but recaptured the three guns
whose loss was announced in yesterday's

battalion took 300 prisoners and three
machine guns.

EL PASO, Tex., June 21.?
Five Americans are in hiding in
the mountains in the vicinity of
Parral, in southern Chihuahua,
fearing to attempt to make their
way to the border because of the
feeling of the native populace, according
to reports reaching here
today. The men, employes of the
Alvarado Mining and Milling
Company of Parral, recently
started toward El Paso, but were
obliged to seek refuge in the
mountains. In the party are T. G.
Hawkins, jr.; A. W. Norris* R. C.
Higley, H. A. Huick and H. W.
Collins. Officials of the company
here express the belief that Mexi
can mends could be depended
upon to afford them protection.
With the exception of these
five, the exodus of Americans
from Chihuahua was practically
complete today with the arrival of
the eight remaining members of
the colony 'in Chihuahua City.
All of them told stories of a
shortage of food and of increasing
anti-American sentiment.
Foreigners Cannot Hold Beal Estate.
Much Interest was aroused among:
El Pasoans, many of whom have largo
holdings in Mexico, in dispatches received
from Mexico City, at the local
Mexican consulate. These said, in substance,
that a decree had been issued
by the de facto government holding
that any foreigner acquiring real estate
in Mexico, either by purchase or contract,
must renounce first his allegiance
to his native country and register him*
self as a Mexican citizen. It further
ordered that any person seeking to
transfer his property to a foreigner
must obtain permission from the proper
authorities.
Sentiment on the border is tense, and
Carranza's reception of the American
reply to his latest note is anxiously
awaited. Persistent rumors were current
again In El Paso that scouting
patrols of Gen. Pershing's expeditionary
command had been attacked south
of Namiquipa by Carranza forces, but
Gen. George Bell, jr., commanding the
military district, said nothing in dispatches
he had received tended to support
these rumors.
