a uroiip of incrnbis of congress un

Mr-Adoo asking' the -abipet members
whether they have any intention of
continuing the civilian pay of de

Many of the eiviliaii employes of
the government have been called out
with the militia, particularly in New

M-veral thousand ate employes of the

Many of these will have larpe fain

Army Bill is
Being Pushed
Very Rapidly
I Ii t r 1 1 a t i 1 1 . i ! .Wws Se-rviee :
WASHINGTON. June -i.As a
result of the Mexico situation and
the approaching end ef the fiscal
year, the army appropriation bill
was given the right ef way in the
house today.
The sundry civil appiopnathm
bill, which does not bear directly
upon national defense, was put aside
in order that the army budget
might be rushed through.
An effort will be? made to se e ure
passage of the army bill by the sen
ate and house before July 1. the
beginning of a new fiscal year. No
interruption is desired in lhe ap
propriations for the army. The
budget carries .approximately $1".
oiio.OOo, which is .? 07,, 000,000 in ex
cess ef that of last year, and furn
ishes the fumls for carrying into
effect the provisions of the recently
approved 1 lay-Chamberlain army
reorganization bill.
That amendments adding addi
tional appropriations must be of
fered to the bill because of the
Mexican situation was predicted to
day. The extraordinary expenses inci
dent to the mobilization of the na
tional guard and the concentration
of troops on the bonier probably
will be cared for in the army bill
instead of by special deficiency ap
propriation legislation. Chairman
James Hay. of the military affairs
committee, said that emergency ex
penses desired by the administration
in connection with Mexico will lie
taken care of in the army budget.
