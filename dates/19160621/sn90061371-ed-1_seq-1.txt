Well, well I look what'a hare,
war with Mexico. Watchful
waiting wins nothing, not oven
votes, which Woody needs ao
badly. Bo, to war!
There ia nothing saered aboat
the office of aonresae judge and
the Republicans have oemmittod
no offense against propriety
whatever ia aomlaatiog Joatice
iiughoa for Preatdeat. Bo all of
this cry of the Democrats aboat
the Republican party carrying
politico into tho supreme court
ia simply partisan rot, ictended
to make a few votes for their own
ticket. When the Democrats
nominated Judge Parker eight
years ago they bad bo compose
tiena against invading the judici
ary to get their candidate.
Don't it make ,yoa laupii, bow
5, political party will whip aroand
;b the course of a few years and
appeal to tho voters with precise
ly tbc samo argament that it had
denounced iho ether party tat
tfslng? 1012 tbe Democrata
sailed tho Koeublieans down tot
appealing se the "grosses" sensi
bilities of the labor vote with the
fall dinner pail argument, alleg
ing that it was an appeal c the
stemaeh father tha. tc the
brain. Now the Democrats are
pointing with pride to the fall
dinner pail, saying that they have
filled it fuller than tbe Republi
can party ere did aod fot that
.reason the labor vote honId go
to Wilson.
The Democratic national con
vention was pulled off as per
scbcdalo in St. Ieuis Inst week
Everything was done just as
President Wilson wanted it, and
after all tho high flown words,
actflT-and antics that tho occasion
produced, tho whole affair boiled
down to its lowest torus resolv
od itself into this simple prepo
Hitien wo want four years more
at the pie counter. It is said
that three fourths of all tboso
attending tbe convention in nn
official capacity, and many of
these who were there merely as
onlookers, had that pio fed ap
pearance. When we recall the
fact that the party in power is!
annually baking and handing oat
to itself $ll,000,(XX)more pie than
the Republicans ever fwd on, we
aan readily understand why the
Democratic party presents such
a woU nourished appearance in
three short years. We may as
mime that if the people lend
theit approval to this hoavy ad
ditional provision of official pro
vondor by the Democrats by re
electing Mr. Wilson, tho extend
ed lease of power will readily bo
turned to extending tho pie
counter, and tbe high ooat ef gov
ernment boosted up another $11,
(XX3.O0O in two or three years.
Democratic rule means more of
fice holders and more taxes to
fatten them up
In an address before tho City
Hub in St. Louis one day laat
week, Wu J. Dry an said:
"The idta of Americanism is
that everyone ahall do his own
thinking, and ehall have the
enrage to stand on his decision
when ho haa made it."
Mr. Hryan said aomething
then. When Americanism means
that we must take ourldeaa from
tho gentleman who happeaa to
occupy the presidential chair or
be denounced as disloyal and
condemned as traitors, wo art
no longer free iooplo. Whoa
wo may no longer find fault with
and criticise the acta and policies
f out chief executive we may no
longer entertain the idea of
Americanism as tho highest
idealism of fro thought. Wo
want to do oat own thinking ao
far as oar individual intelligence
allows ns, and aa long aa wo
oreiao this privilege and right wo
wo will retain oar Amorioantana

One day last week a traveling
Qias woo represents a Urge
manufacturing corporation in
this ten Itory, was a visitor at
this office to get a littlo work
done. In a short talk we had
with him he stated that he was a
Demoarat and bad always voted
that ticket, but ho said. "I leek
for serious lsber troubles in this
coantry as soon as tho European
is over." lie voluntarily admit
ted that he believed that suoh
prosperity as this cosntry was
now having was due almost en
tirely, either directly or indirec
tly, to war orders. Takethesita-
ation over in tho Lead Belt, he
said. Thore labor has had aa
increase in wages of :0 per seat
In the last two years. 'When the
war stops and the price of lead
a t . . ,1 il
declines vo us normal levei me
mining coaspaalea will at care put
wages back to where they were
before the wat boons in lead be
gan, and, ho added; a 30 per eont
out In wages is going to look a
whole lot bigger to tho men than
a ::0 oent raise. They weald sot
accept sack a cat without a fight.
Also, he went on to say, who
Europe steps gguting it is going
to getdowa to the bnslness ef re
cuperating ita laduatrlee with ail
speed and with tho preaeat tariff
law la force the American mar
ket will give Europe the opeaiag
it wants, and oar aaoafaetarere
will bo compelled to meet tho
competition of the foreign manu
facturer upon tho latter 'a terms,
and that tbia competition, nnloaa
arrested by a protective tariff
law, woald prove ruinous to oat
homo indnstrios. This man "did
aot say ho waa going to veto the
Kepabllcaa ticket thla year, per
hapa ho will. His view of a situ
ation which may confront aa Ik
a very abort time, was simply
based upon hla business aaasa,
unbiased by his partisanship.
