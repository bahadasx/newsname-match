IOWA IS
MASTER-
NATURE'S
PIECE
In the July American Magazine is
an article on Iowa by Herbert Quick
"who tells why this state is
rden, qpots of the earth.
Nothing has been left undone by
nature .to complete the work,"he says,
"First Destiny"coyered Iowa with the
waters of the sea, and for millions cf
years there dropped to the dark lfv
«ela of this primordial ocean the
Jime, the gyP®um and the clayt
form the basils and! provide for
the renewal of her soil. There fell
jalso the sandstones for her building®,
^hen man chould come to make them
•Then the sea bed rose, the waters re
ceded, and in the hot, moi®t breath
of the corboniferouis era were laid
l^down the coals, so that when man
cams be might find the sun's heat to
^convert to brick, and Ume, gypsum
and day to combine with heat into
thftt liquid: rock which pours like wat
t«r an turns to living.
"But His hand was stretched out
^Ulh The clays and ledges and sands
then no better than those of any
ier land. They would not do for the
terplece. So there came on the
,,'iearth a great °hlli, and the water®
were made Into a plow, and with that
,(pIow-Qf ice the granites of the north
awer© ground up that their potash
"might be made soil, and thfe potash
phates were mingles with the potash,
and through all ran the lime and
the
vlacial
plow passed over Iowa and
inade of her a great plain of smooth
-tilth, and strewed it with black drift
'fit for the pigmy plows of man
"Then Destiny waited white Hhe
praters made channels for themselves.
And! the swamps dried up. "And for
millions of years the forces of na
ture stored nitrogen in the black soil,
and filled it with vegetable mold like
that which delighted the Children of
Jsrael when they spied out the Prom
ised Land of Canaan, and reported
that it was a goodly .land."
A. B. HOLBERT HOME FROM SAN
ITARIUM.
A. B. Holbert returned home Sun
day from Battle Creek, Michigan,
*where he has received treatment in
the celebrated sanitarium. Mr. Hol
bert'e many friends were pleased to
see him at the Chautauqua assembly
on Monday afternoon, if he can be
persuaded to take life a little easy
for a time his complete recovery from
the stroke he suffered several weeks
,.tago may confident'y be expected.
—Mrs. F. L. Guthrie and Miss
Margaret Lindsay started Tuesday
morning upon a delightful trip to the
south, joining a party of excursion
ists at Des Moines. They will visit
numerous points in the south, spend

took it upon themselves to invade
their home, wholly unbeknown to
them. Harvey Hempstead had invit
ed Mr. and Mrs, Jones to attend the
movies during the early evening, and
while th.ey were at the theater the
Telephone Company's office force pro.
ceeded to take possession Of their
home. Upon their return from *^e
show Mr. and Mrs. Jones had plan
ned to accompany Mrs. Jones' broth
ers to Edgewood for an over Sunday
visit, and when they were about to
depart for Edgewood they discover
ed the self-invited guests hiding in
the kitchen. The surprised young
coupl« lost n° time in making fbe com
pany of friends feel at home, ^and
a most delightful evening was enjoy
ed. Before departing the guests pre
sented Mr. and Mrs. Jones with a
handsome electric reading lamp.
—Mrs. Joslah French and daughter,
Miss Fannie French, of Lascrusus,
New Mexico, are the guests of the
former's cousin, H. S. Webber. The
home of these ladies is only a short
distance from the scene of so much
disturbance along the Mexican bor

THE SPEED MANIAC
(The Dtyersville Commercial)
Granting a license by the state, to
the owner of an automobile, should
mean more than merely securing rev
enue for building roadts. It should
have provisions that make for public
safety and for the safety of those wltc
ride in the automobiles. In o,th -r
words there should be some restric
tions an dcontrl in regards to t)he
driver. The many accidents through
out the state, as a result of auto
speeding, has prov that many a dit
er is not to be trusted with hand
ling a machine, jeopardizing the live®
of the passenger? under hi* care.
Railroads put the drviers Of their
engines through a rigid examination
and a number of years of preparation
before they are entrusted to handle
thie throttle of an engine pulling a
train on a track, the development. of
which, to enable a speed of thirty to
sixty miles an hour has taken yeaiss
of labor and engineering. Tile train,
too, is guarded' by a dispatching sys
tem,
What a contrast to auto driving.
Her® we allow a chauffeur, inexper
ienced, inspired with the ambitions
and follies of a speed demon to take
lives of passengers in hand, passen
gers who know nothing of the qualifi
cations or failings of the driver, and1
attempt to whisk them ever an un
developed tract, at a speed that
would put to shame, the experienced
engineer driving an engine on a rai'
road track, built and cleared for
making time. The dangers of the
speedier is not only to those whose
lives he has in hand, but to all trav
elers on 'the highway, and he is a
menace to car drivers, who handle
their machines conservatively and
keep within reasonable speed.
Unavoidable' accidents, as is tte
case on railroads, will occur from
tlm to time, but until the unquali
fied speed maniac Is weeded out, the
ride of death will continue to be stag
ed and there wiW bo plenty of "first
Page stuff."
—The Ladies' Aid society of the
Congregational church will meet next
Wednesday afternoon with Mrs. J. S.
Jones, who will be assisted by Mrs.
Jennie Jones and Mrs. A. W. Stearns.

NEW PRESIDENT PQJI U. I. U.
Dr. Chauneey P. Colgrove, once a
student of U»ed Iowa University and
for several fears ^gde of the leading
educators of Iowa, lias been elected
to the presidency of Uper Iowa Uni
versity, to succeed^Dr- R. Watson
Cooper, resigned. Dr. Cqlgrove is
well kneiwn to th« teachers of Dela
ware county, having been an instruc
tor at numerous institutes in recent
years. ''jr.
Dr. Chauntiey P. Colgrore was born
in Bath, N. Y. His mother was a
Scotch "Graham." His father was a
Baptist minister—a graduate of col
gate .Unlversiy, N. Y. His health
filing, he brought his family to
Fayette county, Iowa, where he organ
ized mml
gate. He died when ChaumeSey, the
oldpst boy—one Of eight children—
Was siSj years old. This boy, at the
age Qf, lo assumed full control of the
farm. What his mother read aloud
evenings from such books as the
Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire,
Plutarch's Lives, Dicks Sermons and
Shakespeare, this boy repeated aloud
the next day while felling trees and
cutting cord wood, th®s laying the
foundation for his splendid command
of English and his power as a Plat
form speaker.
At 21 he rented the 8arm, moved the
family to #"ayette and entered Upper
Iowa University, working his way
through college by tutoring or by
manual labor. After graduating he
was retained as one of the instruct
ors, leaving to a year or two to take
th© superintetidency at W&ukon. He
went from there to take charge of
Nora Springs seminary, wh4ch he
built up from practically nothing to
an attendance of 500 In three years.
Dr. and Mrs. Colegrove are both
active church workers. Mr. Cole
grove has had charge of the Men's
Brotherhood class of sixty to eighty
members for several years and Mrs.
Co'egrove a somewhat larger class of
young women students. They are
equally interested In social and bU6^"
ness affairs. Dr. Colegrove has been
a member of the Commercial club,
Golf club and a direotor in th© Citi
zens' bank. From every hand comes
sincere expression of regret at the
great loss sustained by Cedar Falls,
whicji all the friends of Upper Iowa
university with one voice rejoice at
thieir good' fortune tin securing Dr.
Colegrove as president.

only solution to a condition which has
become serious, to say the least. Mr.
Scott states that upwards of eighty

DEMONSTRATING ELECTRIC
STOVES
The Iowa Electric Company is con

This demonstration has attracted
lot of attention among the housewives
of Manchester, and by the time the
demonstration is over the company
will have received many orders fcr
these attractive stoves. The electric
stove is without a doubt the most
convenient yet devised, and when in
stalled the user would never go back
to the old method of cooking.
The demonstration is in charge of
a competent cook, who is always glad
and, more than willing to fuBy demon
strate tbe merits of the stoves. The
women of Manchester are urged to
visit the demonstratloii rooms.

ONEIDA SCHOOL
CASE SETTLED
DISTRICT AGREES TO PAY 93,200
FOR SITE. LITIGATION AT
AN END. ,'\Y"S4
AGIEEIENT IEACIED1 LAST WEEK
School Board Decided to Accapt
Mrs. Holbert's Proposition aa to
v'-*? Value of Four Acres.
A settlement was agreed upon last
week, which, when carried out, will
dispose of the Oneida school oase
which promised at the outset to fur
nish prolonged and vexatious littgs-^
tion. At a meeting of th« school
board at Oneida last Thursday tt was"
decided to accept the proposition of
fered by Mrs. Holbert which provid
ed that she would take three thous
and dollars for the landi selected for
a school bouse site, and upon pay
ment af this consideration would de
liver the school district a deed, to tbe
property.
The controversy grew out of the
action of the Oneida school district -in^
attempting to take, by condemnation
proceedings, four acres of Mrs. Hol
bert's farm which had been resery
ed as a building site. In the pro*
cee dings an award of one thousand
dollars was made for the site which
Mrs. Holbert refused, to accept.
The action Of the school district
was contested on the ground that
the proceeidngs were irregular and
that this particular tract coul£ not
be legally ^ongenraed for the reason
that it dtt^netyuljouin a public high
way. it was als^ contended by the
owners that the four acres in ques
tion constituted the only building
site on the farm and by condemning
this tract the farm would be damag
ed far in excess of one thousand dol
lars.
