HOSTDJTY TOWARD U. S.
CHARGED IN SHARP NOTE
Wilson Repudiates Accusation of
Bad Faith?Refuses to With
draw Army.
SAYS CARRANZA TROOPS
AIDED BORDER RAIDS
State Department Makes First Admission
Situation Is Rapidly Getting Worse ?
Militia Draft Held Up.
[From Th" Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. June 20.?President Wilson said hi? final vorrl
to < a rranza to-day. In a note which denies flatly his demand
for withdrawal. the First Chief waa warned that carrying out
his threat of armed resistance "will lead to the gravest conse
quencet." The issue ot peace or war is squarely up to Carranza.
Xo aggressive move will he made by the I'nited States unless
its forces are first attacked by the de facto goverr.metr.
The sending of this note. though the document is far from
conciliatory. is felt to have cleared the atmosphere. The issue
ia now sharply defined; there is no longer any doubt that Pre><
dent Wilson will keep the troops in Mexico. and the next move
is Mexico's.
Ambassador Designate .Arredondo had arranged to ;rp Spi*
retary I.ansing to-day, but withdrew his requeal for an appoint?
ment after the note had been handed to him. Hp made nn ex
planation either of the object of his projected call or hil roason
for cancelling it. It is believed. however, that he ua? anxious
to learn the attitude of Oeneral Carranza after reading thp
Ameriean note before having any further formal intprohanges
.with AmericEn officials.
Funston Asks for Militia.
(ieneral Funston to-day 'elegrtphed .he War DfpartmtJrt
for 65.000 militia to be sent iu ii.r border at once. While thf
militia of no state is realiy nrepared for service. War Depart
: ment officials and officers conferred to-night on waya and means
of meeting the demand. The itatea best prepared are New
Vork. Connecticut. Pennsylvania. Maaeachuiettl, Wisomsin.
Ohio and lllinois. and it is probable that part. at leaat, of their
guard will be ordered to the frontier within forty-oigh* hours.
