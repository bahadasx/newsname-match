became better acquainted.
Attracts Attention.
The picnic today attracted nation

thing for merchants to entertain
farmers at a picnic but it is an un

merchants, for farmers to take the
leading step to become better ac
quainted with the merchants. Rep
resentatives from metropolitan news
papers and from trade journals were
present to attend the picnic.
Mr. McCabe, representing the Mer
chants Trade Journal of Des Moines,
la., stated that this was the first time
that he had heard of farmers enter
taining merchants. He is preparing

magazine.

a Pioneer representative. "It is one
of the best movements I have ever
heard of."

and families attended the dinner at

feature of the picnic this afternoon.

W. G. Shepherd, United Press Staff
Correspondent, Writes on
Food Situation.
NoteThe following is the
second of a series of articles on
the food situation in Germany.
The United Press association
sent W. G. Shepherd, a former
Minnesota newspaperman, to
Rotterdam to learn at first hand
what experience civilians in Ger
many were having as a result of
the food stringency. Shep
herd went to Rotterdam and got
a set of food stories from trav
elers from Germany.Editor.
By W. G. Shepherd.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Rotterdam, Holland, May 26. (By
mail)Right into the baby's cradle,
at his five daily meal times, reaches
the hand of the great German gov
ernment in wartime.
It snatches his milk bottle from
him, empties out half his milk and
fills up the bottle with breakfast
food.
Twice a day, when bottle time
comes, this great hand keeps his bot
tle away from him, and with a spoon
feeds him apple sauce, crushed car
rots and seived spinach.
Babies Won't Talk.
You can't get the babies to talk
about it, though their mothers have
a great deal to say on the subject.
But the fact remains that the babies
thrive on their new menus and that
perhaps the baby experts of Germany
have found a new and better way to
fill baby stomachs.
"Here's my little muchacho," said
a Spanish lady from Germany who
had, as she said, "brought him out to
get him some milk." She displayed
a little fellow of eight months.
"In our town in Germany, if the
doctor gives you a certificate you
may have a pint of milk a day for
your baby.
"The doctor works with the gov
ernment, you understand, and he
makes every effort to persuade
mothers to nurse their children at
the breast.
"If he considers that a mother is
able to do this, he will not issue a
milk certificate and the mother will
not be able to purchase milk.
Under Government Control.
"Nurses also are under government
control and when they discover that
a mother is able to nurse her baby
it is her duty to notify the doctor to
that effect and it then becomes his
duty to cancel the milk ticket.
"The milk that is issued is not
enough for a baby, of course, but the
scientists have worked out a way of
mixing it with an oatmeal or wheat
broth. This is fed from the bottle
three times a day. But he must
have food two other times every day
and the scientists are busily instruct
ing physicians and nurses, who in
turn instruct mothers how to cook
apples, carrots and spinach for the
babies.
"We cook the apples or carrots un
til soft as porridge and serve it to
the baby with a spoon. He hasn't
a tooth in his head yet, hut he has
learned to eat from a spoon. We
put the boiled spinach, through a
sieve."
Likes Apples Best.
"What does he like best of the
three?"
"Apples, because we always put a
little sugar into the apple sauce.

in November will be W. F. Donohue,
Democrat, of Melrose.
Vote Not Complete.
The vote in the district is not com
plete and smaller precincts are slow
to report.
Knutson made a strong race and
his nomination was certain yester
day afternoon when reports were re
ceived from the southern part of the
district. From reports available in
Bemidji yesterday noon, Rogers was
in the lead. The returns from the
southern part of the district soon
overcame Rogers' lead and he will
be third man in the race, it is ex
pected.

Beltrami county by several hundred
votes, despite the fact that Rogers
was given over 100 votes to Knut
son's one at the Red Lake Agency.

wish to congratulate the young man
on the excellent run he made. I en
tered the campaign many months ago
and the work of the campaign I
found to be too strenuous for me and
I have been confined to my home for
the past several weeks, precluding
any personal campaigning on my
part. I naturally hesitated with
drawing from the race and now that
the fight is over I am really thankful
that the result is as it is. I am still a
Republican and will support the
nominee."

Knutson 1,704, Buckman 722 and
