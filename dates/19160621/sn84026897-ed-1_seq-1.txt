Picnic for Veterans ?Thoroughly
Enjoyed. Death of Mrs.
Hubbard. Last Club
i Meeting of Summer.
The annual picnic given by the
i>iary Ann Bnie chapter, D. of C.,
for the veterans and their wives
was heid on last Friday at the home
of Mrs. Martha Edwards, one of the
chapter members. This is the third
of these happy occasions that has
been held here and each one seems
to be better than the other, and the
kind and thoughtful hostess in many
ways assisted most materially in en
tertaining all the the guests. The
large and comfortable home was
thrown open and flags waved about
that gave a touch of patriotism. On
the broad verandas were many rock
ers and seats and here the veterans
were seated and the morning was
spent by them in pleasant reminis
cences. There was a larger number
?of veterans present than for several
occasions. A number of them gave
much interesting data to the chap
ter historian Mrs. O. D. Black, it
being so important that this be
gathered now. The thoughtful hos
tess had baskets of apples and
peaches and refreshing ice drinks
about for those who wished it.
About one o'clock ? regular feast
was spread out under the shade
trees and after all the elderly ladies
and the veterans were seated the
members of the chapter served them
to the bountiful dinner with iced
tea and fragrant coffee. Dinner was
fixed for all the veterans who had
not been able to attend and this was
sent to them. After all had retnrn
cd to the house a short program
was given for their entertainment,
the historiau Mrs. O. D. Black pre
siding. , There were bright and pa
triotic songs in which the veterans
seemed to enjoy singing and then
all were led in prayer by Rev. VV.
. S. Brooke. A paper on "Jefferson
". Davis" W3S ?;iven by Mrs. F. M.
Boyd; vocal solo, "Old Black Joe,"
Mrs. F. M. Boyd; a paper. "Where
the south leads," was read by Miss
Zena Payne. Veteran J. G. Mobley
made a short talk to the veteraus
and urged them to continue in the
meeting of^ camp McHenry and
Rev. Joab Edwards made a few re
marks. "God be with you till we
meet again" was sung and Rev.
Edwards dismissed all with a feel
ing prayer. Although this concluded
the day's program many lingered
and chatted seeming to regret to
leave such pleasant surroundings.
On Sunday morning while Mr.
and Mrs. Erwin Smith had started
to Harmony Sunday school with
their family, they happened to an
accident which might have been a
most serious one. With them in the
car they bad Howers and other
things for the Sunday school room
as this was a special day, and Mr.
Smith in attempting to guide the
car at a rough place could not well
do so as the car was well filled.
He struck a tree, almost demolishing
the front of his new Buick, one
wheel being completely torn ofj. The
occupants were all bruised but none I
painfully injured. . .*..??
Mrs. George Hubbard died here
last Tuesday evening at her home,
the immediate cause of her death
being heart failure. For a few years
she had not been in her usual good
health, but at the time of lier death,
was sick for not more than two
hours. Her death brought genuine
sadness to everyone, for none knew,
this lovely and gentle character but
to love her. She was never seen but
with a happy smile on her face-'
which was but a reflex of her beau
tiful soul. She was a Christian>wo
man and when she was. able, was
always found in God's house, for
worship. She bad raised; it young
manhood and. womanhood five sons

meant so much'to- th?o.*'Th?se!,etiil
dren are Mesdames- Warren Paul
and Monroe Paul of Edgefield,

Connerly and Mr. Dock. Hubbard
of Augusta. Besides"*tbe devoted
husband;are left several grand chil
dren. The services were conducted
on Wednesday afternoon at the Mt.
of Olives by her pastor Rev. W. S.
Brooke who spoke, feelingly of this
departed life. There were many
beautiful^ flowers placed upon her
casket.

Y. W. A. Rally at Parksville.
For several weeks many of the
trirls of Edenfield association had
been looking forward to attending
the Y. W. A.. Rally at Parksville,
June 15. All who were asked to
take part on the program bad kind
ly consented to do so. Many were
disappointed who on Thursday
morning awaked to find that a very
heavy rain had fallen, and the
clouds were still dark and threaten
ing.The Parksville people had plan
ned every comfort for ouroleasure.
The church was tastefully arranged
in Y. W. A. colors, i 311 and
white. The girls under me wise
leadership of Mrs. J. M. Bussey,
had not left anything undone.
Because of the rain we did not
begin the program until 12 o'clock.
We first sang our song "0 Zion
Haste." Tne devotional was con
ducted by Mrs. W. F. Warren.
Miss Gazzie Osborne gave us tbe
most hearty welcome we believe we
have ever received anywhere. Her
paper was unusual, full of humor
and wit. The only visitor at this
time was Mrs. Geo. E. Davis. She
was presented, and after her re
marks all were sure the Rally would
be a success, because of her presence.
The remainder of the time before
dinner was snent in open discussion
ot the topic ''Prayer in the Auxilia
ry or Individual Life."
All hearts were made glad at in
termission by the arrival of a party
from Edgefield, Mr. and Mrs. J. L.
Minis, Mrs. Mamie Tillman, Misses
Miriam Norris and Florence Minis.
The ladies spread a bountiful feast
on the table under the trees. Every
good thing to eat and refreshing
iced tea were served.
After dinner there were a lot of
good papers, among them one on
"Our College Girl" by Miss Lucile
Culbreath, and a debate: Resolved
that Personal Service is a greater
help to an Auxiliary than Mission
Study." The affirmative was ably
held up by Miss Florence Mims and
the negative-by -Miss-'Minnie- Lan
ham. In the absence of the latter,
her debate was read by Miss Kath
leen Parks.
Mrs. Davis gave us a talk
on the real meaning of the Rally
after which we had a Round Table
Discussion. Mrs. Davis answered
many, many practical questions per
taining to Y. W. A. work. We
regretted that there wei"..' not more
delegates to get the benefit of this.
There was an evening service over
which the pastor, Mr. Warren, pre
sided. His remarks were splendid.
Mrs. Davis again favored us with
an address on ''Tipping or Tithing."
Mrs. Tillman gave us a very inter
esting account of her trip to the
Southern Baptist Convention. Mr.
Mims gave us a talk on "The Life
Worth While."'
The whole session was interspers
ed with music'. The Parksville Y.
W. A's. had prepared special music,
and Miss Miriam Norris sang beau
tifully for us.
We are exceedingly sorry that
more of the Y. W. A's. could not
have representatives to enjoy the
good speeches, and the hospitality
of the good people of Parksville.

DAY AT PHILIPPI.
Morning and Afternoon Servic
es. Sumptuous Dinner Serv
ed. B. Y. P. U. Or
ganized.
The editor of The Advertiser
spent a very pleasant da.\ with the
good people of Philippi Sunday.
This church is located about 12
miles east of Edgefield in one of the
best rural communities in the state.
On every hand one observes un
mistakable evidences of progress and
prosperity. The farm buildings and
residences have been improved and
the large fields that spread out be
fore you as level as a plateau show
intelligent application. We believe
one of the chief causes or reasons
for this very general improvement
is that there are practically no
large farms in the Philippi section.
Most of the farms are owned by
small, thrifty farmers. In fact, all
ands in that section of the county
have increased so tremendously -in
value that only a few men are finan
cially able to own large farms.
Crops along the way from Edge
field to Philippi are in the main in
a very satisfactory condition, the
early som being especially fine.
Cotton in some cases was late ger
minating and is smaller than usual
at this season but it has been work
ed out and is now in a growing con
dition.
The announcement that an all
day meeting or service would be
held at Philippi attracted a large
number of persons from three coun
ties. In addition to the Edgefield
folk, there were a goodly number
from Saluda and Aiken, the border
line of these counties being not far
distant.
The Sunday school was held at
the usual hour Sunday morning and
the lesson had been about complet
ed when most of the visitors from a
distance arrived. Dr. T. J. Watts,
the Sunday school specialist of the
State mission board, was expected to
address the congregation in the
forenoon but as he was unavoidably
kept away he SPIU as his proxy Mr.
S. D. Preston, a young layman
from Columbia, a member of Dr.
Burts' church. This young gentle
man spoke very interestingly for
half an hour to the young people
especially presenting the work of
the Baptist Young People's Union.
At th? conclusion of his lay-sermon
he made an appeal to the .\oung
people in the congregation to or
ganize themselves into a B. Y. P.
LT. About forty responded to his
earnest appeal and an organization
was effected by the election of the
following officers: Pr?sident, Boyce
Franklin; vice-president, Miss Doro
thy Williams; secretary, Harry
Scott; treasurer; Miss Ola Baker;
organist, Miss Maggie Shaffer. Af
ter these officers were elected they
were ?invited by Mr. Preston to
stand in a row upon the rostrum in
order that they may be seen by
everybody. And as we looked upon
them, we were convinced that no
other community in the county
could present so strong au aggrega
tion of young Christian workers.
Indeed with such material as this
actively enlisted Philippi church
and community will make even
greater strides forward in the future
than in the past.
As has been their wont for very,
very, many years, the Philippi peo
ple prepared a great feast and all
who., attended the exercises were
bidden to partake freely. The din
ner that was spread under the oaks
Sunday proved beyond peradven
ture that the men of Philippi are
the best of providers and that the
good women are the best of cooks.
Following the dinner which was'so
generously and graciously served, a
delightful social half hour follow
ed. ,
When the congregation re-con
vened in the afternoon a church
conference was held and then the
pastor,' Dr. A. C. Baker, turned the
afternoon session over to Mr. Geo.
W. Scott, the superintendent of the
Sunday school. Mr. Scott is grading
and standardizing his school, making
of it one-of the foremost Sunday
schools in the Ridge association.
He first called upon Mr. W. B.
Cogburn, the superintendent of the
Edgefi?ld Baptist Sunday school,
for a talk and he .was followed.by
Mr. Ji L. 4'Mims who spoke for
about twenty minutes. At the con
clusion of the afternoon session Mr.
Scott announced that the Edgefield
HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Good Church Attendance. Mis
sionary Society to Meet.
School Girls at Home
Again.
Here we are around to Hardy's
service d?y again and a beautiful
dav and very good attendance for
.the scarcity of people living near
the church. So many have had to
leave the neighborhood on account
of the malaria. It has extended as
far down as the Misses Lanier's,
they are suffering from chills now.
Ob! they make a body feel so bad
lyi they don't feel like drawing their
own breath.
We saw Mrs. L. S. Reese while
in'Augusta Saturday and she and
her husband are having chills down
ip Beech Island for the past two
weeks. She says their health is
miserable. Glad to hear Miss Ellie
Mealing is improving. I hope she
will soon get over the malaria and
indigestion, and be herself soon.
We are very sorry Miss Sallie Bunch
is so very feeble. She doesn't improve
or gain any strength. We are going
to try and persuade her to let us
take her up to Mrs. Julia Townes
next Thursday to the W. M. S.
meeting hoping that will divert her
mind and seeing ladies and hearing
the program which is a line one will
make her feel better. She bas not
been able to go from home since
last October.
We were very sorry to hear of
our president, Mrs. T. J. Briggs,
being down with chills. Hope she
may be up and able to attend the
W. M. S. meeting Thursday the
22nd, as we are hoping to have an
other red letter day. Miss xMary
Townes returned home Sunday from
a week's visit to Misses Em
mie, Lila, Minnie, Grace and Lena
Lanham. Mr. Press Lanham aud
Miss Lena came down to church in
the automobile with Mr. Bennie and
M^ Minute.Lanham and all went
'.home with Miss Mary Townes'tc
spend the afternoon. Miss Marjorie
McKie also stopped with them and

Townes and Mr.Frank up to church.
Mrs. Tom McKie, Miss Addilee
