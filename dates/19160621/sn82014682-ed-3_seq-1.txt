The foregoing message, received by
cable this morning from the War De
partment, is considered by army offi
cials here as one of the biggest pieces
of news that has reached the local
department in a long while.
While the details of the increase to
local garrisons will" not be known defi
nitely until receipt of the general or
der, it is evident that it will be by not
less than 2050 enlisted men for tne
Infantry and heavy artillery regi
ments. 1 As stated- in the message the in
crease m coast artillery will be an
nounced later,.tf& that only guesswork
can place any number for these, but
the belief is prevalent that the in
crease "will be large.
Under the new army law the infan
try regiment is composed of practical
ly 1)00 men in. pcaqe strength, and
the beasy artillery of approximately
750. This is exclusive of officers.'
; .'Heavy field artillery regimeota are
to consist of field, and siege type guns.
- Six: batteries make up- a regiment,
there, s?ing .two battalions ot thYee
batteries each in it
It Isnot known where the new regi
ments .will be stationed, and officials
at headquarters do not venture 4 a
guess, : The suggestion is made, how
ever, that the building up of the new
infantry may be made by transferring I
from any of the three regiments the t

which they will be built' up from an
