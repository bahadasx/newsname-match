J, Q, WYAH, NOMINEE
FOR SHERIFF
Wins on Sixth Ballot by a Vote of 12 to
9-Wm. Watfenbarger, as Dark
Horse, Missed the Plum By
Only One Vote in 4th
At tbe meeting ot the republican ex
ecutive committee, Saturday, John Q.
Wyatt was chosen as the nominee for
sheriff to till the vacancy caused by the
resignation of (J. W. Toney. Mr. Wy
att received 12 votes and Wm. Watten-
barger 9. His selection was not a sur
prise as he had been regarded as one
of the strongest candidates to come
before the committee.
It will be remembered that a mass
meeting of the republicans of the coun
ty was called in the court house, Mon
day, June 5, at which time the mass
convention authorized the county ex
ecutive committee to meet, Saturday,
June 17, and elect a candidate to fill
the vacancy caused by the resignation
of G. W. Toney.
Saturday, at 11 :15, Chairman A. L.
Garrison called the committee together
and on tne roll being called it was
found that twenty members were pres
ent. Those absent were: Theodore
Hedgecotb, J. W. Hayes, J. T. Ash
burn, John Manning. The committee
then proceeded to formulate a few sim
ple rules to govern the voting.
RULES GOVERNING ELECTION:
First, That the successful candidate
must receive a majority of all the votes
of all members present.
Second, That no proxies be allowed.
Third, That after the third ballot the
hindmost candidate be dropped, and
drop hindmost man after each succeed
ing ballot
Fourth, Any new candidate who may
enter shall not be dropped until he has
been balloted upon twice.
Fifth, That voting be by written
ballot.
Sixth, that all candidates be and are
invited to come before the committee
and present their claims for the nomi
nation. The committee then adjouined to
meet in the High School building at
one c'lock p. m. to choose the candi
date. When the committee met at the ap
pointed hour the following candidates
made brief talks pledging themselves
to discbarge the duties of the office to
the best ot their ability and with fidel
ity to the peope: J. B. Angel, J. Q.
Waytt, G. W. Walker, 3. A. Hassler.
J. D. Wyatt stated that he had intend
ed to be a candidate, but after fuller
consideration nad decided not to be and
asked that his name be not considered.
S. A. TucKer and John G. Renfro
were chosen tellers and the voting be
gan. The voting was as follows :
FIRST BALLOT.
J. B. Angel
J. Q. Wyatt
J. A. Hassler
Wm. Monday
F. W. Myers
Raymond Kerley
SECOND BALLOT.
J. B. Angel
J. Q. Wyatt
G. W. Walker
J. A. Hassler
Henry Welch
Wm. Monday
Raymond Kerley
At this juncture of the voting Jere
Morrow put in nomination the name of
Wm. Wattenbarger. Several persons
present spoke very favorably of Mr.
Wattenbarger as a citizen, but no one
seemed to be well informed as to his
probable ability to make a sheriff. On
tbe basis of his good citizenship and
tbe enthusiasm manifested for him by
one members of the committee he
received a strong vote on the third bal
lot and only missed being tbe nominee
by one vote on the fourth ballot
We have since been informed that
Mr. Wattenbarger is not physically
sole to discharge the duties of sheriff
and has never bad any experience along
that line.

Number necessary to elect 11.
J. L. Anderson made a motion that
the election of Mr. Wyatt be made
unanimous, which was done. The best
of feeling prevailed throughout both
meetings and those who voted against
Mr. Wyatt congratulated him on his
victory just as heartily as those who
voted for him. The meeting then ad
journed and every one seemed to feel
that no mistake had been made in the
selection ot a strong man before the
people even if some did feel that som
other candidate might have made a
better officer.
Mr. Waytt has had considerable ex
perience as deputy sheriff, being one
of the deputies in the Rush case this
term of court, and there is no doubt
about his ability to handle the work.
There is a feeling that the county
court will very likely elect Mr. Wyatt
sheriff at its quarterly meeting, Mob
day, July 10, in which event he will
have tbe chance to get familiar with
tke duties before the August electino
and the people will have some chance
to estimate him and determine to some
extent his fitness for the place. Just
what the county court will do, how
ever, no one can say.
Many expressions of satisfaction at
the outcome of the work of the com
mittee were heard after adjournment
and many expressed themselves as sure
that tbe strongest man before the peo
ple bad been chosen.
The writer has known Mr. Wyatt
personally and intimately for nearly
fifteen years and we take pleasure in
stating that we believe ne will measure
up to the duties of the place and will
spar ne effort to preserve order in all
parts of the county. By talking with
him we are convinced that he realizes
fully the strong sentiment that per
vades the people in demanding that he
discharge the duties of the office hon
estly and faithfully, and that it is of
the utmost importance that deputies be
carefully selected. His course in this
regard will be very carefully scrutin
ized and many persons will surely form
their opinion ot his fitness from those
appointments. However, Mr. Wyatt
can have nothing to say as to any ap
pointments until after the county court
elects him, in case that should be done.
In the event the court should choose
another, Mr. Wyatt can not be held
responsible for any official acts as
sheriff. Should the court decline to
elect at its quarterly term in July,
John Q. Burnett will continue to dis
charge the duties of the office until af
ter the election in August and the per
son elected shall have qualified.
