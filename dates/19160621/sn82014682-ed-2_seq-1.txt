SeiicHI Moriwake of VMana,
: . Kauai, Serves Term, of ' "
:: ;v; Forced Duty V
'seilhl' . Moriwsfte, Hawaiian-born
but-recently released from the? Japa
nese army, has Just' been granted a
birth 5 certificate by the territory of
Hawaii..
vMoriwake, who is 26 years of age,
is a native of Man a, Kauai, and speaks
English fluently. According to the evi
dence ' produced by him when he ap
plied to Secretary Wade "Warren Thay
er for a certificate of Hawaiian birth,
he was "grabbed" by the Japanese
army" for two years' service during a
visit' there with his parents. This
was two-years ago, and Moriwake's
service expired only recently. .
He came to the secretary and ap
plied for a certificate almost immedi
ately after arriving here, and after he
had shown the necessary evidence the
paper was granted to him. Moriwake's
work was with the infantry branch of
the Japanese army.
"I left nere with my parents in
1911," said Moriwake, "and went to
Hiroshima. One day the officials
came to me asking why I was not in
the array I told them that I was an
American citizen, having been born in
Hawaii, but had no papers to prove
my asseTtftn. The next thing I knew
they, clipped me into the service, and
there I have been for the. last two
years. 'I was about ready to return
to the Hawaiian Islands when I was
thrust into the army."
Moriwake intends to take no more
chances on becoming a Japanese sol
dier by compulsion.. and lost no time
npon his , return to apply for his pa
pers. They were granted today. ;

- The foregoing message, received by
cable this morning from the War De
partment, is considered by army offi
pials here as one of the biggest pteee
icf news that has reached the local
department in a long while.
While the details of the increase to
local garrisons will not be known defi
nitely until receipt of the general ot
der. it is evident that it will be by not
less than 2050 enlisted men for tne
infantry and heavy artillery regi
ments. As stated in the message the in
crease in coast artillery will be an
nounced later, so that only giiesswork
can place any number for these, but
the belief is 'prevalent that the in
crease will be large.
Under the new army law the infan
try regiment is composed of practical
ly 1300 men in peace strength, and
the heavy artillery of approximately
75. This Is exclusive of officers.
Heavy field artillery regiments are
to consist of field and siege type guns.
Six batteries make up a regiment
there ing two battalions of three
batteries each in it
It is not known where the new regi
ments will be stationed, and officials
at headquarters , do not . venture a
guess. The suggestion is made, how-
ever, that the building up of the new

Interest now centers on' the prob

It is considered likely, that there
would be a rapid general advance'
of the American forces a hundred
or more miles south of the border.
The line then established would
be fortified and held until the
volunteer reinforcements should
arrive, and thus - the fighting
would be thrown into the enemy's
