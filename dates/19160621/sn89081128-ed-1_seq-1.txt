flLD CHEERS FOR
MINUTES WHEN WILSON
IS NAMED.
KERN SETS RECORD WHEN HE
NOMINATES MITCHELL IN
FIVE WORDS.
Democratic delegates at the St. Louis
convention demonstrated that the
G. O. P. hasn't a corner on the noise
and other convention fireworks when
they broke loose and cheered their chief
for a solid three quarters of an hour
last Thursday at the night session in
which he was nominated with but one
dissenting vote. Robert Emmet Burke
with the combined stubbornness of
the two Irish patriots whose names
i^e bears used his Irish prerogative to
ite "agin" anything and everything
and theoretically at least, kept the
Wilson nomination from being un
animous. But 1,091 votes to 1 ought
to be sufficient proof that the Demo
cratic party is solid for Wilson.
Senator Kern put himself in line for
the Iron Cross and Star and Garter
Decoration when he kindly forgot his
long nominating speech for Vice Presi
dent Marshall and simply declared:
"I nominate Thomas Riley Marshall
for vice-president." Verily, after
£he hip-hip-hurrai of the.Wilson de
monstration it was the biggest inspira
tion Senator TCern has had in many
a long day. All opposition to Marshall
that seemed prevalent in the early
stages of the convention passed away
and Marshall was nominated by ac
clamation.
The platform was not yet ready
for the Thursday night session and
was introduced Friday morning. The
onjy disturbing factor that entered
Ifito the otherwise harmonious adoption
'of the committee report was the spirit
ed fight over the adoption of the minority
report on woman suffrage. This was
soon squelched, however, and the re
port went sailing through as planned.
The platform as adopted is, in brief,
as follows:
The Democratic party, in national
convention assembled, adopts the fol
lowing declaration to the end that the
people of the United States may both
realise the achievements wrought by
four years of Democratic administra
tion and be apprised of the policies to
which the party is committed for the
further conduct of national affairs.
Administration Indorsed
We indorse the administration of
Woodrow Wilson. It speaks for itself.
It is the best exposition of sound Dem
ocratic policy at home and abroad.
We challenge comparison of our rec
ord, our keeping of. pledges and our
constructive legislation, with those of
%.any party of any time.
We found our country hampered by
special privileges, a vicious tariff, ob
solete banking laws and an inelastic
currency. Our foreign affairs were
dominated by commercial interest for
their selfish ends. The Republican
party, despite repeated pledges, was
impotent to correct abuses which it
had fostered.
"Abuses are Corrected."
Under our Administration, under a
leadership which has never faltered,
these abuses have been corrected, and
our people have been freed therefrom,
*^*'v«^8,_. Oar archaic banking and currency
system, prolific of panic and disaster
under Republican administrations—
long the refuge of the money trust—
has been supplanted by the federal re
serve act, a true democracy of credit
under government control, already
proved a financial bulwark in a world
crisis, mobilizing our resources, plac
ing abundant credit at the disposal of
legitimate industry and making a cur
rency panic impossible.
\j nt. "Fair Competition Assured."
j,X We have created a federal trade
'ty. commission to accommodate the per
plexirig questions arising under the
anti-trust laws so that monopoly may
be strangled at its birth and legitimate
industry encouraged. Fair- competi
tion in business is now assured.

that swollen incomes bear their equit

Besides losing the services of the

there is possibility of having to do

In commenting on the situation to
the Review reporter, Dr. Fritsche
said, ."I do not know what my

FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
WILL BE SPENT ON NEW
MACHINERY
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE NOT
DESIRABLE UNDER PRESENT
CONDITIONS
Head Miller J. H. Siegel of the Eagle
Mills has just imported an additional
dozen expert mill-wrights to hustle the
extensive improvements in the big mills.
This is the slow time of the year in the
milling business and the mills are taking
advantage of the lull to get in first class
condition for the heavy rush that is
bound to come later. Approximately
$15,000 is to be spent at the Eagle plant
during the next few weeks in overhaul
ing the old machinery and in making
many important changes and additions
of new machinery.
Both plants have felt the stimulus of
war orders directly or indirectly. Tha
Eagle mills have recently disposed of a
number of large orders to eastern
capitalists that will no doubt be disposed
of to the warring nations. Considerable
shipping is being done to the Scandi
navian countries and it is probable that
much of this flour will find its way to
Germany.
Mr. J. F. Armstrong has just returned
from an extended business trip of seven
weeks during which time he visited about
all of the eastern and central states as
well as the South. He reports a great
deal. of pr^pjeritx evident thruout that
section of the United States with "war
orders" the main cause of the flush
times. He had an opportunity to visit
the great Remmington Munition Plants
that have sprung, up like a mushroom,
as a result of the World War. There are
fourteen of the great buildings erected
during the last year and a half. Each
is a complete factory in itself tho all are
connected and work as a unit. The
entire plant is surrounded,by a high iron
fence and every precaution is taken to
prevent "Accidents" that might send the
factories as high' as the cost of munitions.
In summing up the foreign market
situation for the Review reporter, Mr.
Armstrong says that the rush of business
with the South American countries has
not been so great as many economists
had predicted. The Eagle mills are not
making any special effort to develop this
new field as the trade is not considered
as profitable nor as desirable as other
foreign trade where the market has al
ready been made. "We do not care,"
said Mr. Armstrong, "to do business,with
the Latin:- American countries on the
basis to which they have been ac
customed. They, are used to long ex
tensions of credit and as we have no
good method of determining their rating
we do not feel like trusting them too. far.
The situation may change, however, if
they can be taught to do business on a
white man's basis."
Rev. Mayer returned from the five
days state conference of his church at
Fairmont last Monday. He was ac
companied by the president of the
Tuesday after a short

SIDE LIGHTS ON MOBILISATION.

at the armory in true soldier fashion.

It was interesting to watch the Iboys
prepare their'equipment. It is no easy
matter to roll a blanket together with
the other paraphernalia of the service
into*a compact roll that will fit snugly
over the shoulder. It took many of the
men quite a while to pack properly. If
you think it iseasy,'just try to put all
your household equipment together in
in a pocket handkerchief and still have
a nea't bundle.
Every private was carefully examin
ing his gun and cleaning its mechanism.
He may not be afraid to face a Mexican
rifle but you can bet your life if he has to
he is. going to have his gun in shape to
do his share of the shooting. It might
be awkward to have a shell jam while a
Greaser is blazing away at you and not
be able to return the compliment.
Lieutenant Klause was the busiest
rnan in the armory Monday and Tuesday
In. the absence of Capt. Groebner, he
was the ranking officer and as there is
at present no second Lieutenant in Co.
"A" all the burden of the preparation
fell upon his shoulders. There was very
little rest for the acting captain.
The band boys were feeling pretty
badly left out of things last Monday
morning. Their orders to mobilize
did not come till the middle of the after
noon and it looked for a time as if they
night was extremely animated. The
men of Co. "A" went thru a spirited
drill on the armory floor before a large
and appreciative audience of the fair sex.
A Guardsman was observed by a
group of civillians dashing madly down
the street. "He is getting in training to
run, now," said one of the hard hearted
wretches.
There is certainly something alluring
about the uniform that catches the eye
of the weaker sex. There was hardly a
soldier Monday evening who didn't
"make a catch".
With all the excitement of the pre
paration of our own boys, a story from

my name and made me 'No. 575' they
took me to church, where I had never

excitement
reigned in New Ulm
morning when the order
for the militia to mobilize and

from Adjutant General Wood as a
result of-President Wilson calling the
National Guard of all the states to the
colors in the Mexican crisis. Both
the Machine Gun Company and Com
pany "A" were called in the morning
and the band got its orders the middle
of the afternoon.
Captain Groebner's telegram read
as follows:
"The President of the United States
having called the militia and national
guards of the state of Minnesota to.
the Service of the United States, I
am directed by the order to order:
your organization to prepare for mo

were somewhat below the required
Strength but enlistments have! come
in with.a rush and both companies will
soon be up to the requirements and
ready to answer the call of their country.
The situation,that precipitated the?
sudden call to arms' is the trouble witlr
Mexico that has steadily been growing
toward a crisis since the raid of Fran
cisco Villa and his bandits called for
the punitive expedition into Mexico.
President Carranza of Mexico demanded
the immediate withdrawal of General
Pershing's troups from Mexican soil.
This seemed impossible until the ban
dit was brought to book for1 the killing
of Americans at Columbus.and several
brushes have occured between the forces
of Pershing and Carranza. Now the
American ambassador has been recalled
and war seems very imminent.
President Wilson's call, coming thru
Secretary of War Baker, is as follows:
"Having in view the possibility of
further aggression upon the territory
of the United States from Mexico, and
the necessity for the proper protection
of that frontier, the President has
thought proper to exercise the author
ity vested in him by the Constitution
and laws, and call out the organized
militia and the national guard neces
sary for that purpose.
This order wjiich includes the guards-
support Gen. Fred Funston's line and
thus release instantly 30,000 regular
troops "who are trained to the minute
and who are sorely needed to support
Gen. Pershing across the border.
The entire mobile regular army of
the United States, several provisional
regiments of coast artillery, serving as
infantry, and the National Guard of
Texas, New Mexico ad Arizona are
now on the border or in Mexico. The
Pioneer Press estimates that General
Funston has at his disposal about
40,000 regulars and probably 5,000 or
more Guardsmen. Ofthis number 10,000
regulars are with General Pershing or
scattered along his line of communica
tion from Namiquipa, Mexico, to Col
umbus, N. M.
Minnesota .is expected to furnish
some 3,500 citizens soldiers. Of this
number, New Ulm can proudly say she
is furnishing over a hundred.
