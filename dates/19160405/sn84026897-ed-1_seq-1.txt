Statement Concerning Field
Day.
I If tiie weather is good on April
the 7?h, Field Day. there is going
to be a big crowd here. One very
important matter is to furnish din
ner not only for our own people!
but for those who come from a dis
tance. This we realize, is no small
undertaking- We need the help of
every housekeeper in Edgefield
school district. So we earnestly re
quest every one to bring or send a
well filled basket. The stores will
close so that all may cometo the
Hchool grounds for dinner. There
will be a committee to receive your
basket at the school building if you
desire to Rend it instead of bringing
it with you. But when the dinner
hour arrives we want each lady
who furnishes a basket, if possible,
to look after the placing of its con
tents on the table. In this way you
will greatly assist us and at the
same time, prevent your dishes, etc ,
being misplaced.
The parade is to be formed
promptly at 10:30. The exercises!'
will begin a*, the school grounds ;
immediately thereafter. The days'I
program is full and in order lo be;
carried out, the contests will bel
called promptly. Let everybody be
on time. It is very important that
each school furnish the committee,1;
with the names of its contestants j 1
before-Friday April 7th, if possi- '
Mo. Let every teacher at tend to |
this to-day. Mach school is ai low- j '
e<i i wo representatives in each con
test. \

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Corn up and Cotton Being
Planted. Death of Dr. R. L.
McKie. Moving From
Community.
March winds begin about the
'middle-of February, arni nnw April
has come the high winds continue.
We are hoping they will not blow
all the rain clouds away, for we do
need rain so badly. The winds have
blown all the moisture out of the
soil. Gardens are backward, and
can't plant until we have rain to
soften the hard clay.
Chicken crop also verv late. Hens
rested too lonir before they began
to lay, then took their time about
setting.
We are expecting a lot more cold
weather between this and Easter,
so the farmers have not rushed their
seed in yet, for they haven't corn
or cotton to waste.
In going out to Sweetwater last
Thursday we noticed Messrs. Sam
pie an! Mealing Hunch have corn
up and were planimg cotton right
along. Hope i: will not get killed.
They are exceptions.
We have lost another of our
nearest neighbors. Dr. ll. L. Mc-j
Kio has crone to his reward. \Ve?
sympathise most sincerely with his
bereaved wife and family of seven j
childrerk'Tis hard to realize that he
has been taken never to come back1
to those he loved so devotedly. For I
ho certainly was % devoted husband, I
and kind ?md thoughtful father. ;
Miss him, ah yes, we shall all miss,
him, but his family, oh, how they;
will miss him. How thev need him.
They ara so dependent. The wife,]
our heartfelt, sympathy is with her, |
in her great uriel" and trial. This is M
five of her immediate family that!
have passed away since May li) 15. i
May G-od give lier strength to bear <
it and 'wjydom to direct and raise i
hyr family. They are all so young i

much.
"We shall meet but we shall miss
him ,
Thereshall be a vacant chair.''1
i
Mow many vacant chairs are j,
therein our community now? Sol,
many within the past two and al j
half .\ears and no epidemic either. !
So many have died and so many ,
iiave had to move out of the neigh
borhood on account of malaria un- ?
iii we feel our country is almost /
ruined. Mr. Will Briggs moved .
about a week airo to Mr. Adams' ,
place to try and get out of the ma
larial zone, but carried so much in j
their systems that they have all
been down with chills ever since
they moved.
Mr. McKie Scott moved to North
Augusta this week from the Mor
gana neighborhood.
Mrs. Harry Bunch and four chil
dren visited her father's family Sat- i
unlay returning home Sunday af- ?
te moon.
We ?'ere very sorry to hear of
Mr. George S wea ringen losing his
mules and wagons by being run I
over and killed by an automobile
in North Augusta last Saturday.
Those who have automobiles should i
not drive so recklessly as they do.
They have no regard for persons in
a bogg}' or waitui, or walking at
all. Seem to think they have exclu- i
sive rights to the streets and public
roads. The wonder is they do not
kill more people and animals than
they do. They have no more re
gard fdr ladies and children than
for dogs. I feel each time I go to
Augusta as though ? am going to
be run against and torn to pieces in
the buggy they run so close at top
most speed and honk, just in my
ear as they Hash past. There should
be a law against such behavior and
it '"-uould be enforced it seems to
me. I hope Mr. Swearinsren may be
reimbursed for the lull value of his
team and wagon.
