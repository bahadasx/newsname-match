Doubtful Aspect of Returns
Throughout State Makes
Victory Small.
350 SALOONS TO GO
Prchibs Win That Number
and 250 Others Will
Be Reopened.
Chicacn. April 5. Tragically com- j
picte return? today from points where j
the option question was vottd upon in
Illinois indicate that little advantage
went to either side as the result of!
jcstrriiay's election. Prohibition vic
tories indicate that between 350 and
400 saloons wore eliminated, while
towns won by the liquor forces from
the dry column will open territory that
had more than 250 saloons at the time
of the 1912 dry victories.
Rpturns showed that the saloon in
terests won back Bloomington and
CarlinviUe, retained Aurora, Lincoln
and Alton and had picked up about
twenty townships scattered over the
state. The anti-saloon forces gained
Waukegan snd Moline, held Elgin and
also entered wet territory and gained
a number of townships. The greatest
victory for the anti-salon interests oc
curred at Waukegan, where 94 sa
loons were voted out in Waukegan
and North Chicago. The victory for
the dry forces there makes all the lake
shore territory from Chicago to Wis
consin line, a distance of 60 miles, pro
hibition ground.
Women's Role Important.
Returns from practically all the j
contested territory indicate that worn- j
en played an important part in the;
election. Favorable weather brought;
out a large vote. Both sides profess to
see victory in yesterday's election.
The prohibition forces em
phasize the fact that contests
were not made in several of
the larger towns that became dry in
the 1912 and 1914 elections, while
some of the saloon men asserted their i
belief that yesterday's results indi
cated that the crest of the dry wave
had been reached in Illinois and that
a reaction had started against the anti
saloon movement. The principal
towns that voted saloons out were
Waukegan, Odell, Moline, Dixon and
Annawan. Those which went from the
dry to the wet column Included Bloom
ington, Amboy, Lockport, Pana, Car
l'nville, Geneva, Grafton and Herrin.
Wet and Dry Towns.
Anti-Ealoon forces retained their
lad in Belvidore, Canton, Champaign,
De Kalb, Dwight, Decatur, Elgin,

gained ground north of Caillette wood
northeast of Verdun in the course of
several engagements during the night,
the war office announced this after
noon. West of the Meuse there were no
events of importance. Twenty mines
which were thrown into the Meuse at
St. Mihiel by the Germans were ex
ploded by the French with no dam
age. French War Report.
The communication follows:
"In the Argonne there has been a
combat with hand grenades in the
sector between Bolante and Fille
Morte.
"To the east of the Meuse last night
we took part in several engagements
during the course of which we made
progress in the connecting trench to
the north of Caillette wood.
"In the Woevre district there has
been an intense bombardment in the
sectors between Moulainville and
Chatillon.
"In the Lorraine district the Ger
mans .after a violent bombardment of
our positions between Arracourt and
St. Martin, delivered several small in
fantry attacks. They were every
where thrown back.
"In the region of Verdun French
aeroplanes on April 4 engaged in no
fewer than fifteen aerial combats dur
ing the course of which a double
motored German machine was brought
down near the pond of Hauts Fourne
aux. Another German machine fell
down near the wood of Pilly and a
third German aeroplane fell vertically
to the ground. All the French pilots
got back without suffering damage.
"During the night of April 3-4 one
of our aerial squadrons bombed the
railway station at Nantillois and' the
barracks at Damvillers."
German War Report.
Berlin, April 5, (by wireless to Say
ville.) The following statement on
war operations was issued today by
German army headquarters:
"Artillery engagements in the Ar
gonne and in the Meuse districts are
continuing with undiminished vigor.
"On the left bank of the Meuse, the
French were prevented by the Ger
mans from again occupying the hill
northeast of Haucourt.
"In the Fort Douaumont sector
yesterday, repeated counter attacks of
the enemy broke down the German
line southeast of the fort and in
front of the German positions in the
north part of the Caillette wood.
"During the month of March, in
aerial engagements on the western
front, the Germans lost, 14 aeroplanes,
of which seven were lost in air com
bats. "The British and French lost 44
areroplanes, of which 38 were lost in
air combats."
In yesterday's fighting around Ver
dun the Germans lost considerable
ground and again sustained heavy cas
ualties, notwithstanding the forma
tion of their attacking parties.
At 3 p. m. after the ground had
been battered by several hundred
tons of projectiles, a thin line of
riflemen debouched from Chauffour
wood, a little to the northwest of
Douaumont. The Germans advanced
by short bounds toward the French
trenches, situated about 300 yards
south of the village. A second and a
third line followed at equal distances,
with small supporting and attacking
columns in the rear. This formation
has been noticed during the last few
days and is regarded by the French
as proof that the Germans have been
sorely punished in their previous as
saults in serried ranks.

CHICAGO VOTERS
ELECTALDERMEN
Bitter Factional Fight Restts in Add
ing Three Democrats to the
City Council.
Chicago, April 5. Complete returns
in yesterday's alderraanic election
show.thal. the .- -r.ic-. ats made decided
gains throughout the city and that they
outvoted the republicans by more
than twenty thousand votes. The dem
ocrats made a net gain of three mem
bers in the new city council and elect
ed their candidate for the municipal
court bench, Leo J. Doyle. The elec
tion was fought out on- purely local
issues, with the suicide of Dr. Theo
dore B. Sachs, former head of the
municipal tuberculosis sanitarium, on
Sunday, proving a potent factor in the
defeat of the administration candl-
j dates. While the democrats made a
I net gain of three in the council, they
i did not win party control of the body.
Their vote in the new council will be
32 as against 29 in the old. The repub
licans will have 3G votes, as compared
I with 39 in the outgoing body, while
the socialists retain the two votes they
fiad. The democrats yesterday elect
ed 21 aldermen, the republicans 13,
and the socialists 2, the remaining
votes in the new body being those o?
holdover members.
The vote cast yesterday, 457,334,
was an especially heavy one for an
"off year." Heated fights within the
republican and democratic parties
brought out a larger vote than is us
ually cast at aldernianic elections, al
though the woman vote, which it was
though would be particularly heavy,
fell considerably below expectations.
The republican ticket with 188,912
votes, suffered most heavily in yester
day's contest, that being 20S,uo3 less
votes than were cast on that ticket last
year in the mayoralty contest, when
William Hale Thompson, the present
mayor, was elected by 147.477 major
ity. Democrats yesterday polled 210,
028 or but 41,033 less than last year.
Socialists yesterday received 59,779
votes or 21.327 more than last year.
The total women's vote yesterday was
54 per cent of registration and the
men's vote 6S per cent of registration.
MILKMEN CLASH
WITH STRIKERS
Chicago, April 5. Attempts to de
liver milk to the plants of the big dis
tributing concerns who are resisting
the demands of milk producers in the
Chicago district for higher prices, led
to several clashes today.
From Elgin there was a report that
a farmer not a member of the Milk
Producers' association had slashed
the hand of a picket who sought to
prevent him from delivering milk to
a plant on the -outskirts of Elgin.
Announcement was made of a mass
meeting to be held today at Elgin by
the farmers' organization at which
it was said an appeal for one thou
sand men to act an pickets to prevent
delivery of milk to the distributors
would be made. There was talk of
sending a squad of pickets to Dixon,
111., one of the points front which the
distributors were said to be obtaining
imilk.

Chicago, April 5. Many prominent
persons and leaders in the medical
profession attended the funeral ser
vices conducted at N'aperville, 111., to

TOBACCO NEEDED
BY THE TROOPERS
American Soldiers In Mexico in Cry
ing Meed of Something to Smoke
Salt Also Scarce.
Columbus, N. M., April 5. Salt is
the commodity most in demand by
American troops at the front, espec
ially the troops of the Seventh cav
alry, according to reports made today
by the crew of the first truck train
arriving in Columbus from the far
thest extremity of the American
line. The small supply the cavalry
men carried with them when they
crossed the border three weeks ago,
was exhausted in two days and they
have had none since. Tobacco also is
priceless, one of the truckmen assert
ing that a trooper offered him $1.50
for one-half of a five cent bag of to
bacco. Several of them commented upon
the optimism with which Mexican in
habitants of that portion of Chihuahua
through which American troops are
passing have started tilling the soil
for the first crops they have planted
since the five years of revolution got
well under way late in 1910.
The change in attitude of the peons
who have come into contact with the
silver-spending "Americanos" is re
markable, members of the crew said.
The first timidity and fear have given
way, with lack of molestation and
plundering by the khaki "soldadoes"
to an increasing friendly meeting.

El Paso, April 5. The problem ot
locating and capturing Villa some
where within an area of 1,600 square
miles confronts Brigadier General
John J. Pershing today. Information
from the front states that the Ameri
can troops have been disposed to the
best possible advantage, but the task
of running down the Mexican bandit
in an ever-widening territory as the
brigand moves southward into the
Mexican interior becomes increasing
ly difficult.
More troops are necessary. Is the
word that comes back from the gen
eral leading the flying columns scour
ing the Beinto Juarez and Guerrero
regions for the elusive brigand. Gen
eral Pershing has ordered that de
tachments of infantry be trained for
mountain climbing and the establish
ment of a sort of American chasseur
corps will be immediately undertaken.
The American commander anticipates
a long hunt and is preparing for it.
A Torreon dispatch places Villa at
Maica, 90 miles southwest of Guer

can Consul Garcia the executions of
three ringleaders of the conspiracy of
a band ot Mexicans to seize Juarez
last Sunday night and declare for the
