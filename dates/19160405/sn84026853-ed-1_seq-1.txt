The Germans still are carrying or
strong offensive operations northeas'
and northwest of Verdun. About foui
and one-half miles northeast of th(
fortress they penetrated the Caillett<
wood, just outside Fort Douamont
after a violent bombardment.
From part of this wood the Frenct
in an immediate counterattack drov<
back the invaders.
Another powerful attack was de
livered against that portion of th<
Avocourt wood held by the French
but here the French barrier fire ant
machine guns held the Germans with
out gain.
The French now have entirelj
evacuated the village of Vaux anc
have drawn their lines south of th<
town, but in its immediate outskirts
Berlin says that northeast of Hau
court, between Malancourt and L<
Mort Homme the Germans have en
tirely cleared the French from aboul

Berlin asserts that the aerial combats
have resulted in their favor. Both

Three British and one Norwegian
steamer have been sunk by submarines

boats, the liner Achilles and the
Ashurton were on their way to London
from Australian ports. The
British steamer Goldmouth was on a

EXTRA SESSIONS IS NOW
ADVOCATED BY McLAURIN
Columbia, March 30. ? (Special)
?An extra session of the General Assembly
to be called for the purpose
of enacting a law for State insurance
was suggested to Governor Manning
this afternoon by John L. McLaurin,
State Warehouse Commissioner, who
in a letter to the Governor says: "The
situation has reached a point where
it is necessarv that vou call the leeis
lature together to provide for State in
surance." He says that he is convinced
that the fire insurance companies
are determined to make a fight to the
finish and he does not believe in surrendering
to them, and the only alternative
is for the State to go into the
fire insurance business.
The Warehouse Commissioner in
"passing the buck" to the Governor
says he thought he had the cotton
warehouse insurance safe but that the
big companies are whipping the little
companies into line and that nothing
can be done. The only thing, he says,
to do is for the State to go into the
insurance business. Sen. McLaurin
suggests to the formation of a State
warehouse insurance by each warehouse
taking stock in a central company,
pay the premiums a year in
advance and the central company to
reinsure.
He also approves of the formation
of mutals and suggests that the state
make arrangements to borrow $1,000,000
to start off the State insurance
company.
COOPER IS PLEASED.
Columbia, March 29.?R. A. Cooper,
of Laurens, solicitor of the 8th
judicial circuit and candidate for
Governor, passed through Columbia
yesterday on his way to Batesburg,
where he was to speak last night.
Mr. Cooper had nothing to say
for publication as to what his atti?

the approaching campaign. A definite
and comprehensive statement
"will be made in due time," he explained.
His announcement is meeting

than he anticipated, he said. Letters
from all sections of the state
are reaching him, he said, endorsing
his candidacy and pledging him support.
U. S. AGENCIES ON ''
I GASOLINE INQUIRY
B
: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO
SAY WHETHER PROSECUTIONS
ARE WARRANTED.
x Washington, April 2?Government
. acpnries investigating the SDectacu
. lar rise in the price of gasoline have ^
4 virtually concluded preliminary jj.
\ phases of their work and will report
to congress this week. In the mean- ~
' time the department of justice will gc
x consider the evidence with a view to
> determining whether prosecutions
are warranted under the anti-trust
law. ,
Every available field agent of the
1 federal trade commission has been W(
? assigned to the gasoline inquiry un- be
1 der the direction of Commissioner W. S6(
* J. Harris. Reports by the various ea
companies involved have been check- ?0
r ed so far as possible. Crude oil pro- ce
1 ducers, manufacturing companies, re
i pipe lines, selling agencies, even tank co
. wagons, in every section of the coun- pa
- try have been under surveillance. re
i The department of justice virtually
- left the entire inquiry to the com- jy
fc mission. Complaints received by the tg,
r attorney general have been forward- |n"
r ed for investigation to the commis- ^
sion and have been added to hun- jyj
! dreds of similar complaints received jje'
I by the commission itself. It is con- ^
j sidered unlikely that the attorney ^
. general will decide finally whether
tuc ?rvlucnuc nmiaaifO i/ivoctuuviiu
, unril the commission shall have conl
eluded its inquiry a month or more
^ hence.
5 The first report to congress will 10
! contain comparative figures showing
k the amount of gasoline and crude oil 12
. produced at present and two or three
. years ago, the volume exported, rela- 1
. tive costs of production, amounts 2
. sold in each section of the country 8
f then and now and comparative wholesale
and retail prices. No comment
i will be made on the reasons for the
rise.
! A second report, data for which is
. not yet complete, will supplement ch
i the first with an analysis of the situ- f0]
. ation and will set forth reasons to ur
. which the commission attributes the ne
, tremendous increase. al?
, The investigation has been con- fl0
i ducted with a view to determining 0f
i four salient points as follows: ^
i 1. The extent of production and po
r use of gasoline now and two and on
three years ago. pa
! 2. The volume of gasoline exported
r and the supply remaining here for ed
I domestic use particularly as to whe- s
: ther the rise or any portion of it
i could be attributed to a scarcity of ?id
product. 1111
[ 3. Whether there has been dis- Pa
. crimination by big producerb in favor
, of big buyers. co!
[ 4. Whether there is actual compe- ru
tition among the former elements
. that went to make up the oil trust;
[ if there is, to what extent and how
[ the small independent producer is c'a
affected thereby. ?n
The department of justice has "a
been particularly interested in all ?e
phases of the investigation which ?e
would shed light on the possibility of Sc
a connection between the rise and
the administration's proposal recently
to levy an emergency revenue tax
of 1 cent a gallon on gasoline. This
' phase of the investigation is said to
! be incomplete.
It is understood that the forthcoming
report to congress will not fully aC(
support tne recent announcement ox jjj,
| the department of the interior that ^ '
| more gasoline was being produced CQ.
1 and cn hand than ever before. It is
understood that the report will state
that the present does not mark the ruj
" high tide of production and that while
there is a great quantity of gasoline
1 on hand the supply is not as large as
it was some time ago. This report,
it is said, will be based on later fig- ^
1 ures than those used by the interior
department. .
Representative Bailey, of Pennsyl
vania, announced tonight that he "*i
would introduce a bill tomorrow to
' authorize the secretary of the interi- r '
; or to sink oil wells on public lands n'T
and market the product, giving pre- *
ference to independent refiners to t
present arbitrary increase in prices.

OF THE PERSISTENT REPORTS

Columbus, N. M., April 2.?Army
men here were considerably disturbed
today by numerous warrings from
:onfidential sources that adherents of
Francisco Villa were gathering in
the Chihuahua desert, both north and
south of Ascension and near the motor
trail leading from Columbus to
Casas Grandes for tiie purpose of attempting
to cut the line of communication
of the American punitive expedition
in Mexico.
An extra heavy guard of infantrymen,
with specific instructions in
event of attack was placed on a truck
train, which left here for the front
today. Isolated camps of soldiers
guarding the line wer6 reached by
field telegraph and ordered to watch
:losely for signs of hostile forces
Lieut. A. W. Gullier, 20th infantry,
sf Lexington, Ky., adjutant of the
base, left by train for Colonia DubIan,
where he will attempt to co-ordinate
more closely the work of the

There were persistent reports that
the forces of Col. Dodd had captured
the bandit leader but because of difSculty
in communication had been (
inable to report. Late advices from j
Sen. Pershing's camp stated that the j
track of a vehicle believed to be car- i

Unofficial information here today <
was that several score of Villa's ad-1!
lerents, captured or wounded in the L
engagement at San Geroinmo ranch ]

COMPROMISE BETWEEN . DANIEL'S
PLAN AND GENERAL '
BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION
Washington, April 3.?The house
naval committee brought to an end
today prolonged hearings on the
1917 naval appropriation bill. Secretary
Daniels closed a three-day
statement before the committee with y 5$
i final appeal in support of the administration's
five-year building program.
A sub-committee immediate*
ly will begin framing the bill.
It became known tonight that a
determined effort would be made to
provide for six capital ships, two
ireadnaughts and four battle cruis- i
srs, as a compromise .between the
recommendations of we secretary ..3
and of the navy general board.
Mr. Daniels parried all efforts toiay
to get a statement as to what
relative place among naval powers
the United States should occupy. He
said the five year program he had -".-y
mapped out would nflt put the country
in second place, in his judgment
and that the present congress could
not be asked to make up for deficien:ies
of 20 years past At the close
>f the war he believed a great opportunity
would come for international
limitation of armament and with a
strong building program adopted, the j United
States would be in a better
position to urge that movement sue- J
:essfully than if its fleet was weak. v ^
