COLUMfUS, April 5. American
cavalrymen are clearing Vllllstas from
the district between Namiquipa and
Guerrero today, making a series of
desperate and forced marches. Ma
jor Sample declared the Americans
probably had figured In skirmishing
and running fights almost daily.
With a strong cavalry guard a mile

of Columbus today to reinforce the
manhunters. Sold ers reported that
farmers along the line are planting
their first crops since the Mexican.
I factional armies began ravishing the
country.
SAN ANTONIO, April 5 Funston
admitted that Villa had escaped south
and probably was heading for Par
ral. Only a few companies are avail
able for his pursuit there. Head
quarters exhibited pronounced pessi
mism today. Funston said u contin
uance of the chase further south
ward necessitated stronger forces.
Colonel Brown had not reported to
day concerning the clash with Vlllls
tas on Saturday. Pershing said 30
bandits were killed but no Americans.
Funston blamed false Information
which Villa sympathizers gave pur
suers, for Villa's escape. He said the
necessity -f protecting the lines of
communication rendered it impossible
to send a considerable force further
south. Pershing reported from Guer.
rero last night, giving a meager ac
count of Brown s clash with the ban
dits. Trenches have been dug at some
Points along the Amer'can communi
cation lines as a protection against
small bands of outlaws.
Information from Juarez this mor
ning said that Villa had been located
with a few followers between Cam
argo and Parrel. He must be within
fixe miles of Santa Hosila. Juarez of
ficials 'nststed that Herrera was hot
ly pursuing him.
More arrests were expected today
at Juarez In connection with a plot to
seize Juarez while soldiers were lis
tening to a concert. Followers of Di
az. Villa and Orozco are suspected.
Minor Prlsto ordered that the three
who confessed be executed, despite
the protest of Consul Garcia.
Knowledge of this plot caused the
recent Carraxuta mob ligation near the
hordes and alarmed Americans. Ring
leaders of the scheme enlisted al
custom house suurds at Juarez and
were so constantly grouped that they
were ready to strike at the opportune
moment. Fifty suspects have been
