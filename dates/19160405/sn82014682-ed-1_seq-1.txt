Third Judge of Local Court Said;
to Resent Confirmations of!
Chief Justice Robertson and
Circuit Judge Whitney
WCfNT GIVeIrEASON
BUT CONFIRMS RUMOR
Strained Relations Among . Lo
cal Wearers of Ermine Laid
to His Outspoken Sentiments
Thomas D. Stuart, third Judge of
the first circuit court, Honolulu, has
fent his resignation to the department
of justice In Washington, D. C. 4
When confronted today with a re
port from an authentic source to the
effect that he was contemplating re
signing. Judge Stuart simply stated
that his resignation is already In
Washington. It is believed the resig
nation went hy cablo either yesterday
or the previously. ;
; "Will you state the reasons for your
resignation!" the Jurist -was asked.
-There is no neod to state any
causes," he answered. "But I see no
reason why the fact that I have ten
dered my resignation should not he
made public" - '-
Judge Stuart was asked-to confirm
a report to the effect that he had stat
ed to a local attorney that he would
. resign If the nominations of Chief Jus
tice A. G. M. Robertson and Circuit
. Judge William L. Whitney were con
firmed fcy the senate.
Th.re Is no Jeed to say anything
cbout that," Judge Stuart said. "Just
pay that la an interview with Judge
Stuart as to the probability of his re-
signing, he stited . that his resigns
tlon was already In Washington."
The Star-Bailetln - learned today
from authoritative sources that some
w.t1nieaso-Judg- Srwart luforwed-tite-department
of Justice that if. Judges
', Robertson nd Whitney were retained
he would resign. . '
.They' were retained..
" Strained relations with Circuit
Judges Ashford and Whitney, as well
' as with Chief Justice Robertson and
Governor Plnkham, are believed to be
the reasons for Judge Stuart's resig
nation. During the last year Judge
Stuart 'filed in circuit court a suit
against Governor Plnkham In which
he condemned the homestead policy
of the chief executive, following it up
with open letters to the press giving
further light on his own idea of the
homestead situation. The governor's
demurrr .to complaint was sus-
'!." tained by Circuit Judge Ashford, thus
' rloBlng the matter as far as the lower
court was concerned.' Judge Stuart
has ne7er taken the case to the su-
ireme court. .
Prior to the bringing of the suit, and
while the matters of the reappoint
. menta of-Chief Justice Robertson and
-Judge Whitney were pending Judge
Stuart Hied with the department. of
Justice an affidavit In which, it Is un
derstood, the chief justice. Associate
Justice E. M. Watson, and Circuit
Judges Ashford and Whitney were
flawed. While admitting at the time
that some such affidavit had been
.sent to Washington, Judge Stuart de
clined to maka it public.
Only recently iudgf Stuart wrote an
open letter to local' newspapers in
which he advocated commission gov
ernment for the, territory of Hawaii,
end criticized the present territorial
government under Governor Pinkham,
as well as the government of the city
and county and the conduct of the lo-
" cal courts.
Yesterday afUrnoon the Star-Bulletin
received a cablegram from its
Washington correspondent to the ef
fect that the reappointments of Chief
Justice Robertson and Circuit Judge
Whitney had been confirmed by the
' senate. -'
Since Judge Stuart says that his
resignation is already 'in Washing
ton t is presumed it went by cable.

The chancellor beiran his. soeech
with a review: of the rnilifary sittu
tionV ; He stated that "since his last
speech "in the ITeichstag, the Dar
danelles enterprise of the Allies has
ended as a failure; that the Serbian
campaign, together-with the Aus-tro-Hungarian
and 'Bulgarian Al
lies, .was brought- to "a victorious
end; tliat Montenegro and Albania
likewise are now in the hands of
the German allies ; that the English
have - attempted in vain to relieve
their, force at Kut-El-Amara ;. that
the Russians, have succeeded in oc
cupying Erzerum with superior
forces; that'- the, Russian attacks
against the front in east Galicia and
the Italian attacks against the Ison
zo position have been beaten back.
The Russians, he continued, also
drove their columns against the
German lines but they broke down
before the resistance of von Hin
denburg and his heroes. , The ene
my's reports that German military
force has been used up he branded
as erroneous. The Verdun battle,
tie asserted, proves that where the
found foresight and where the
. Cl
bravery of the German troops'- is
'tested, there is one advantage after
another gained. .. ; . ; . ;
The chancellor then expressed
the nation's thanks to the soldiers
and their leaders. Discussing the
question of "Starving Germany
out," he said : -
'I understood that the enemy, in
1915 would not give up this hope,
but I don't understand how cool
"heads, after the experiences 1 of
1915, can still cling to it. Our ene
mies forget that, thanks to the or
ganizing power of the whole nation.
Germany is equal ,to the task - of
the distribution of victuals. They
forget that the German nation in
case of a real scantiness disposes of
imposing moral reserves, which en
'able us to lower our standard of
life, which had risen . remarkably
during the last decades. ;
: "What would it mean if for in
tance the consumption of meat
would temporarily be lowered vto
'the level of the 70's? I -should
think that our adversaries would
remember how strong was the Ger
man race in those days."
