on the Immediate completion of ar

General Funston, giving more de
tafled Information regarding the
flgnt between a sqnadrtm of the
Tenth cavalry and the Villa band
last Saturday, in which the enemy
Is estimated to have lost between
80 and 40 men. In the dispatch
miMiH a bare announcement of the
engagement, no mention la made
of American losses. It Is hoped at
headquarters that the next dispatch
from the field commander will con
tain news of the whereabouts of
Villa.
Awaited Details.
The second encounter with one of
Villa's scattered forces aroused deep
interest at General Funaton's head
quarters, where additional details
were awaited eagerly, but the Interest
in the reports was not comparable to
that displayed after the battle at
Guerrero, when it was believed the
capture of Villa himself was a ques
tion of hours.
It was realized by army officers that
tbe effect of Colonel Brown's fight and
of other minor engagements that may
occur is only indirect so far as the
greater problem of catching Villa is
concerned.
Engagements of that character, it
was said, may be expected now from
time to time, and the running down
of the marauding bands is essential to
the' safety of the American columns,
but it was indicated the only effects,
so far as Villa is concerned will be to
destroy the morale of his supporting
force and deprive him of a certain
amount of strength.
There are known to be other bands
operating in that same part of Mexi
co'and a part of the American forces
must remain to deal with them while
the other part rushes on in the pursuit
of the fugitive chief.
More Troops Needed.
The action south of Bachinava on
ly served to stiffen the opinion of staff
officers that it the punitive expedition
is to complete its work a great many
more troops must be sent into the
country or the Mexican Central rail
road from Juares to Chihuahua and
even through Chihuahua to points
further south must be used for the
transportation of troops and supplies.
The official admission of General
Funaton's headquarters that the suc
cess of the expedition now depended
largely on the freer use of the rail
roads or the material strengthening
of the long round-about line of com
munication and its branches, revealed
a situation, that it was believed might
alter the entire plan of pursuit.
Villa's latest southward shift was
credited in official quarters since it
came froni consular reports, in which
the outlaw was located well beyond
Chihuithua' City and evidently trying
to reach Farral or. perhaps even Tor
reon or Durango City.
In the vicinity of all thoses cities,
there are known to be operating or
ganised forces of Villa's men aggre
gating a strength of several thous
ands.
VWa lYaveilng Fast.
Aeeording to late reports, Villa ap
pears to be traveling fast now and al
ready has placed between himself and
the pursuing Americans ja considerable
distance.
To m*et the new situation, staff of
ficers hare assert, -a quicker means of
ssndlpg' forward trosprf and supplies
should be made, and It was pointed
out that the direct Juarez-Chihuahua
rtilroad offered that Rieanat or a largo
number of troops must be asnt to
Cblumbus Immediately fqr campalgn
lig ttt UtScc.

:cftloA now ipalntal*ed wou)d re«ulre
tne calUhg 0( four regiments left in
11!4 XhMtfd States other
than tfiose en-
der should be used, in the opinion of
army offioers here, unless they are re-,
placed by other military units. The
only remaining regiments that might
be called are the Second cavalry and
the Third and Thirteenth infantry.
Army men do not believe, however,
that the troops along the line of com
munication, even if increased by these
three regiments would be adequate to
guard the line if it is extended east
from Guerrero and then south as far
as the chase of Villa might require.

This command was ordered Immedi
ately to block one of the passes
through which Villa's men might try
to escape. Word was hurried back to
Major Frank Tompkins at the advanc
ed base by automobile. Major Tomp
kins is of the Thirteenth cavalry, the
officer who led the American pursuit
across the boundary from Columbus,
the morningViUa raided the Ameri
can town. The officer who carried
word back to Major Tompkins asked
the automobile mechanic one ques
tion: "Have you extra tires?"
"Yes," was the answer.
Not another word did the officer
speak.
Close Another Passage.
But he threw the car into high
speed, over rocks, ditches and hills
until the escort riding with him used
both hands to keep from being
bounced out of the seats. Tompkins'
orders were to close another of the
passes against Villa's escape The men
who had been without rations except
such as they could pick up In the
country for four days, were favored
by the arrival of an automobile sup
ply train which pulled in Just before
they left on a night ride. These cav
alrymen were ordered to leave their
swords behind and were told that no
matter how much else they might ac
complish, it would be of little avail
until they caught Villa himself.
During the night the troopers from
headquarters camp made a midnight
start for their station which It was
hoped would ctose the last door by

April 5.—In retreating to the north

cavalry already arriving. Providencia
and Santa Ana. from 40 to 50 miles
north of the scene of the Guerrero

and mountains, ranging in height
from several hundred to several thou
sand feet, apparently thinking they
would temporarily find refuge. Among
some of these hills the Americans
found marks of carriage wheels.
Was it Villa's Carriage?
"Was this Villa's carriage, or was it
a vehicle carrying supplies to the head
of some trail leading .to a mountain
hiding place?" This was.the ques
tion every officer asked. This was the
news hurried back to General Persh
ing, a few hours after the fight. It
met hfm A^ady at the front, for he
had pass«a Ihrough his'TOOiit advapcatl

TRANSPORTATION IS BIG PROBLEM TROUBLING PURSUERS OF MEXICAN BANDITS
This comparison shows that 'this
expedition's undertaking is no child's
play. No railroad is in use and prac
tically no food is obtained, in Mexioo,
and since both Villistas and Carran
slstas are alike tn appearance, cua
toma and language, extreme care is
required to guard against spies and.
surprise attacks.
While variation of rations has been
limited, the food now supplied to the
men—war bread, beef, beans, toma
toes and coffee—is the best possible
for sueh a campaign. Siioh a diet

of the Youmans cas#-was reached this
•forenoon wheit Youmans in cross
examination testified that when he
signed a contract^.conveying his in
terest in the banf to othel- parties,
he was in duress &d not in his right
mind and not resK6irrlble. Youmans,
beginning his siJttK day in the witness
box, was taken clferge of by Senator
Purcell.
The witness continued making vol
untary statements and the court made
the following warning: "I particular
ly desire to caution you at this time
to make no more voluntary state
ments. I have cautioned you fifty
times. The witness should be severely
fined for contempt of court. I do
not desire to do it at this time but
will see what develops later and see
whether I will do it or riot."
The question of proving the value
of assets other than those of bank
books was argued at length, while the
Jury was excused. The court ruled
that "they would not pay depositors."
More alleged unvaluable paper,
amounting to 148,(!78, was brought
out by Senator Purcell.

Paris, April 5.—The French

announced this afternoon.
In yesterday's fighting around
Verdun, the Germans lost consid
erable ground and again sustain
ed heavy casualties, notwith
standing a new formation of their
attacking parties. At 8 p. m.. after
the ground had been battered by
several hundred tons of projec

The chancellor indicated in his
speech that any suggestions of
peace on the basis of the destruction
of Prussian military power would
make possible only one answer—
"the German sword." He stated
that if Germany's adversaries de

ANOTHER STEP
IN LONG FffiHT
U. S. Supreme Court Order
filed Staying Operations of
Bond Department Law
Bismarck, N. D., April 8.—When
the United States supreme court's or
der. staying the operation of the
North Dakota bond department law,
was filed in Bismarck today by At
torney Aubrey Lawrence of Fargo,
another step in a long drawn out
fight against the creation by the state
of a department for the bonding of all
township, school, city and county offi
cials, was taken.
Defeated in the state courts, where
the act passed by the last state legis
lature was declared constitutional,
surety bonding companies of North
Dakota, allied with bonding com
panies doing business in the state,
have taken their case to the United
States supreme court—and that body
has issued the order by which the
operation of the North Dakota law is
suspended.
Prior to the service of the notice of
suspension today on W. C. Taylor,
commissioner of insurance, and on
John Steen. state treasurer, the for
mer official had made practically
complete plans for the establishment
of the department, all printing inci
dent to the work having been ordered
following the state supreme court's
refusal to intercede.
When the state legislature three
years ago passed a law creating a
bonding department, it was urged
upon the legislature that a combina
tion of bonding companies had been
perfected whereby an exorbitant
premium was collected. Figures were
submitted to show that there was no
competition in bidding for bonds, and
also that the bond premiums had in
creased in most remarkable style.
The supreme court declared the
first act unconstitutional, because the
bonding department was made a part
of the state government, and surety
bonds issued would have been opera
tive. against the general funds of the
state, if a loss ensued.
Last year, to correct this, the legis
lature separated the bonding depart
ment, making it entirely separate,
and in no way laying the state liable
to loss. The supreme court of North
Dakota upheld this year, and now the
United States supreme court is being
asked to pass on the question.
In the meantime. 16,000 township
and school officers can furnish surety
bonds, as in the past—the state's
hands being tied,_
