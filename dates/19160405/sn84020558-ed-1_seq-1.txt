Republican A. P. Leased Wire
An attempt of the Germans to push
further south against the French in
the region of Douaumont, northeast of
Verdun, has met with repulse and con
siderable losses. In the same sector
north of the Caillette wood, the French
have continued their progress in driv
ing back the Teutons.
The German attack south of Douau
mont was launched against the French
first lines of defense, but the French
raked the advancing Teutons with
their curtain of fire, machine guns and
infantry fire, -ircing them to retreat
in disorder northwest toward the
Chauffour wood.
An attack by the Germans on the
town of Hnucourt, northwest of Ver
dun, also failed, as" likewise did an at
tempt to reach the French trenches
near Seppqis, in the, Vosges mountains.
Elsewhere along the western front
there have been only reciprocal bom
bardments and some mining activity on
the line held by the British.
On the Russian front the artillery ac
tivity of the Russians in the lake re
gion south of Dvinsk has increased, but
in general no important changes in the
positions of the Russians and Germans
have taken place.
The Austrians have occupied the bor
der ridge between Lobbialta and Monte
n-hili wns hulrl liV the Italians.
IT
Artillery duels are .still, in prprr4tt3X -Jirrc were even some smalUbets
on the Doberdo sector of the Co! Di
Lana and in the Giudlcarian Alps.
Another iieppelin raid was made on
England Monday night, the fourth in as
many days. Berlin says that fortifica
tions near Yammouth were attacked. A
British official statement asserts that
no. casualties resulted and damage was
small.
The British chancellor of the ex
chequer estimated the direct war ex
penditure of Great Britain for the pres
ent year at 1,500,000,000, the total ex
pondituie amounting to about 5,000,
000 .daily. He provided for new tax
ation amounting to about 6u,000,000
annually and declared that the govern
ment was raising over 300,000,000 a
year by the taxation imposed since the
beginning of the war.
PARIS, April 4. A powerful German
attack against the first lines of the
French south of Douaumont was re
pulsed today and the Germans were
driven back in the direction of the
Chauffour wood, which lies to the
northwest. The French artillery con
centrated their fire on the retiring
Germans. x
"On the west of the Meuse a Ger
man attack against Meuse failed."
Naval Battle Reported
COPENHAGEN (Via London), April
5. A naval engagement of some kind
took place Monday in the Catlegat, ac
cording to dispatches received here
from Kullen, Sweden.
About noon, the dispatches say. a
terrible cannonade was heard from the
sea and two hours later a German tor
pedo boat, badly damaged, was towed
past Helsing borg.
Expect Prompt Reply
WASHINGTON, .April 4. After to
day's meeting of the cabinet it was said
authoritatively that the United States
could expect prompt reply from Ger
many to the inquiry regarding the
British channel steamer Sussex and
other vessels which evidence before

tempt will be made to determine what
course the United States shall puraue

for completion of ; the investigation

Granting Franchise to Tucson, Phoenix and Tidewater
Railroad Carries Overwhelmingly One. Arrest During
Day, That of Third Ward Judge J. P. Hannan, On War
rant Charging Registration of One Not Qualified
Peter Corpstein was elected mayor charging him with illegally registering
and James A. Jones commissioner at
the general city election yesterday. By
a majority of 441, Commissioner Corp
stein won out over Mayor George U.
Young, candidate for re-election, while
Mr. Jones defeated former Councilman
Claud W: Cisney by a majority of 49:1.
Incidentally, Mr. Jones, the sole candi
date supported by The Republican, led
the entire field, rolling up the hand
some vote of 2378. as against 2355
cast for Mr. Corpsiein, 1884 for Mr.
Cisney and 1914 for Mr. Young. His
election was a distinct ictory for The
Republican's campaign for a business
administration.
With considerably over 5000 names
on the register, the total vote cast was
4356. This means that about WOO who
had registered failed to go to the pofis.
It is presumed that of the 1000 re
maining away, at least 200 were those
whose registrations were questionable
and who feared arrest as a restdt of
the expose by The Republican of
wholesale registration frauds.
There was activity every minute of
he day at each of the six voting pre
cincts. Automobiles were kept hurry-
ng back and forth bringing voters for
the variousc candidates. It was no
ticeable, however, that the greatest
number of machines were those of the
Corpstein workers.
Until noon there were good inuicar
tions. so ,the poll workers said, that
Mayor Young was in the lead, but early
in the afternoon the ' Corpstein vote
began to flock to the polls until at ij
o'clock the watchers conceded Young's
defeat by majorities estimated at any
where from 100 to f00 votes. Bets
wore fresly placed throughout the day
with the Corpstein men offering odds
of from 7 to 5 to 2 to 1. It is said
placed at 3 to 1 for Corpstein.
The vote of the ordinance granting
a franchise to the Tucson, Phoenix &
Tidewater railroad was heavily in
favor of the measure, 3394 being cast
for it and 104 against, giving the meas
ure a majority of 3290.

watchers on hand at all of the voting

Fred Gardiner, tinder $1000 bonds
to answer m the superior court to a
charge of procuring the Illegal regis
tration of Savanah Robinson, was one
of the most active workers about the
Fourth ward polling place, and in this
work he was ably assisted by Perry
Payne.
There was little delay in the count
ing of the ballots. The count was com
pleted in the Fourth ward a few min
utes after 7 o'clock, and the Five Points
polling place finished "soon afterward.
Then came the Third ward, with the
first precinct of the First ward fol
lowing closely. The entire count was
completed by about 9:30 o'clock.
The interest manifested in the re
sult of the election was shown in the
hundreds of telephone calls that came
to the office of The Republican. 'Two
clerks did nothing else but answer the
telephone from a few minutes after the
polls closed until about midnight. The
Republican by a carefully worked-out
system was enabled to secure official
figures within one or two minutes.

KANSAS CITY, April 4. George Kd
wards, republican, was elected mayor
of Kansas City today by 8,160 votes, ac
cording to the unofficial count com
plete. He defeated Mayor Henry L.
jost, democrat, who was seeking re
election. The vote announced tonight
was Edwards 30.S1S, Jost 22,058.
Edwards was pledged in his campaign
platform to submit to the people for
their approval a charter embodying a
simplified form of Kovernment for the
city.
As a result of today's election, which
practically was a clean sweep for the
republican ticket, the republicans prob
ably will have half of the sixteen mem
bers of the upper house of the city
council, eleven of the sixteen members
of the lower house and all the city's
administrative officials.
The election today was the most
hotly contested one for many years.
Two police commissioners, James S.
Lapsley and Cojonel Fred A. Lamb,
were remanded to the county jail by
Judge Clarence A. Burney of the cir
cuit court for contempt, after having
ignored writs of halieas corpus issued
to compel them to release 300 men held
at police headquarters who were al
leged to have been arrested to prevent
them from voting. The commissioners
w;re released on bond a few minutes
after the polls closed, after having been
in jail more thaji three hours. They
are to answer the contempt charges to
morrow. Republicans said the charges
would be pressed. r.-
Twenty-one attaches of police head
quarters, including Captain Flahive,
acting chief of poliee, and J. L. Ghent,
chief of detectives, also were brought
into court on similar charges. Captain
Flahive was the only one remanded to
jail. The charges against the police
men probably will be dropped, it was
said.
Eighteen of the 300 men arrested and
held all day were ordered released
about 6:30 o'clock. Tbis gave them 30
minules in which to vote. The others
were admitted to bond after the polls
closed.
A pitched battle, which featured the
most turbulent municipal election this
city has witnessed in many years, re
sulted today in the placing in the
county jail of James S. Lapsley and
Colonel Fred A. Lamb, police commis-
ioners, on charges of contempt of
court, after city patrolmen had arrest
ed more than 300 persons, all of whom
were held at police headquarters. The
commissioners were released on bond
early tonight.
The commissioners were remanded to
Jail by Judge Clarence A. Burney, of
the circuit court, because they had ig
nored writs of halieas corpus issued by
Judge Burney that would have freed
the arrested men. Previous to their
incarceration, Captain Thomas J. Fla
hiVe, acting chief of police, had been
released from the jail by Judge Ralph
S. Latshaw, of the criminal court, after
having been locked up several hours.
Captain Flahive bud been sent to jail
on charges similar to those against his
superiors.
The dragnet that crowded the sta
tion with men and a ,few women, whom
opponents of Mayor Henry L. Jost,
democrat, and candidate for re-election,
said were nothing more than po
litical prisoners, were put into action
shortly after 3 o'clock this morning and
continued throughout the day.

clared, had been wearing buttons de-

FIRST FIGHT WITH VILLA

Railroad Problem More
Serious Than Villa Hunt
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, April 4. The news that
t Villa band had suffered a (second
defeat at the hands of the American
troops, this time at Aguas Calientes,
30 miles northeast of Guerrero, was
received here tonight in a markedly
sober manner compared with the ela
tion over the first blow struck by
Colonel Dodl last 'W ednesday.
Confirmation of the news that Villa
himself is far to the south, approach
ing I'arral, has lessened Interest in
the actual pursuit of the bandit and
has diverted attention once more to
the railroad problem which, army of
ficers here admit, is rapidly becoming
acute. i
There is frank skepticism in army
circles here over General Pershing's
ability to push much further into
Mexico without the aid of the rail
roads, it is pointed out that the
numlsr of men required to guard the
present Son miles or more of commu
nication is out of all proportion to the
total number of troops at General
Pershing's disposal. Even if General
Funston is able to get the reinforce
ment be has asked for, the problem Is
stiil a most serious one.

ringleaders uf a Villista plot to over

SAX AXTON'IO, April 4. Surprised
during a siesta, one of the groups of
Villa's forces driven from Guerrero,
was defeated Saturday by a squad
ron of the Tenth cavalry under Col
onel W. C. Prown. According to in
formation secured by General Tersh
ing and forwarded by him to General
l'unston today.
In this second , engagement the
American troops have had with Villa's
men, tie bandits loss was estimated
at 'from 30 to 40 killed. Xo mention I
of American ioss was made. j
Colonel Brown's encounter with tlie
Mexicans had not been reported to
General Pershing when he made his
report, his information being gained
from friendly, Mexicans who had ar
rived at a point near Rubio, where
Major Evans of the Tenth cavalry
was halted yesterday. '
Major Fans reported tha' " onel
Brown had encountered a . of
Villa's men Saturday and was pur
suing them through San Antonio.
Soon afterward Mexicans who arrived
from that vicinity declared that ho
h:;d overtaken the wandering bandits
at the village of Aguas Calientes, 20
miles southeast of Bachinava,
Villa's men, according to their ver
sion of the encounter, appeared whol
ly unsuspecting of the presence of an
enemy a minute before they were at
tacked. It was about" noon' when Colonel
Brown , brought his cavalry within
ers concerned in the plot, who num
ber between- fifty and sixty, will be
given a military trial later.
The men under sentence of death
are Sebastian De La. Cruz, Nikolas
Chavarria and Lorenzo Dernandez. De
La Cruz is a Villista colonel Who en
listed as a private in the Carranza
army to act as a spy. Chavarria was
foimerly secretary to Pasqual Orozco.
Both he and Hernandez lived In Juarez
as civilians.
It is stated that a number con
cerned in the effair are still at large
in El 'Paso, but the chief actors had
leen gathered in. The three convicted
were arrested last Sunday the day
named for th'i outbreak."
Consul G ireia made public tonight
a telegram vvtich he said General Ga

"I have confirmed from eye wit
nesses among others from one of my
own soldiers who was made prisoner
at Npmiquipa that the bandit Villa
was wounded in the knee so that he
was unable to mount his horse."
General Gavira said tontgiu that he
had received a telegram from General
Rettani at Madera in which General
Kertani claimed to have authentic in
formation that Villa, wounded In a

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
GENERAL J. J. PERSHING'S
CAM P, SAX GEROXLMO RANCH,
CHIHUAHUA, April 2. (.By aero
plane and motor courier to Columbus,
M., April 4.) The American expe
ditionary forces' first fight with the
Villa bandits was a running match,
with the bandits trying to do all the
running. .
This was learned today when part
of Colonel Dodd's command, which
participated in the fight arrived at
the supplied base near the headquar
ters camp. When the Americans over
took the Villistas in a surprise attack
last Wednesday morning, the bandits
made no attempt to fight the Amer- '
icans, whom they equalled in num
bers, except when they were brought
to bay by the hard riding of the
pursuers.
Few of them yelled, even in the
excitement of the fighting, although
yelling has been heretofore character
istic of the Villiastas in excitement.
. These were plainly some of the Vil
listas who participated in the Colum
bus raid, and apparently they had no
heart left for another battle with
American soldiers. The Guerrero riv
er divided some of the pursuers and
the bandits for a time during the five
hours' running fight. Americans gal
loped for some distance along one
bank of the river, firing as they rode
at the bandits on the other side.
As the Villistas in small groups
rode up the sides of the foothills, they
offered tiny targets for the American
forces strung out along the line of .
pursuit. Against the brown grass of
the open slopes, men and horses were
distinctly visible for great distances
until they reached almost the vanish
ing point of size. Some of the troop
ers had unusual opportunity to test
their marksmenship at the extreme
range of killing for an army rifle.
about 3,000 yards.
At about a mile a few of them made
hits, but most of the thirty known
dead were shot at shorter ranges.
The number of Villistas wounded is
problematical. These bandits are
noted for their hardihood in recover
ing from wounds without ' the aid of
modern surgery. A meat saw to am
putate a limb without an anaesthetic
for the patient, is an ordinary oper
ation among then. When the ampu
tation is done, the saw Is heated and
clapped over the raw wound to cau
terize it. Wounded men treated by
these primitive methods are easily
hidden in the mountains.
Colonel Dodd's men looked fit, not
withstanding their days of riding and
fighting without rations, other than
such native food as they could buy
along the line of march.
The Guerrero river passes the town
of Guerrero. In closing, about the
town, the Americans placed two
squadrons of cavalry on the roads
facing the city and another squadron
across the river from the town. A
fourth command took position near a
ford on the river at one edge of
town. Owing to a guide's error, the
squadron which was to occupy the
position across the river was slow in
arriving and the Mexicans saw one
squadron in front of the town before
they knew that there was ,any com
mand across the river. At1 first the
Villistas tried to ride to the south
west but the fire of the cavalry in
front of the city made this too risky.
A few Villistas 'crossed the river,
however escaped. The main force
! turned northeast, heading across the

While at El Centro, General Bell

the battalion.
Military and civil authorities both
in Imperial valley and here declare
they do not expect trouble along the
border, the movement of troops to
Calexico having Tjeen ordered more as
a precaution.
General Bell's visit here follows
complaints of people living ner the
border that roving bands of armed
Mexicans have been seen recently just
south of the line,
