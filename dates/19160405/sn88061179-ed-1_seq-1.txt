number of the members of the
Bristol Country Golf Club have

' Inexcusable Waste of Life
and Money," Declares
State Board of
Health.
Richmond, Va., March 3t.?
Virginia's typhoid hill for the
report year 1911 15 amounted to
II round $1,000,000, according to
statistics jUat'compiled by the
State Board of Health, and the
neglect of sanitary precautions
against this disease cost, the]
people in >re '.hall half the
amount necessary to run the
State government.
"The past year," said an
ollicer of the board, "was mark?
ed by less typhoid than any
year in the recordsof the hoard
The total number of cases was
only 42 per qetit as many as in
1908-00 Yet few realize Hint
our typhoid for last year repre?
sented an excusable waste of
life ami money.
"At the lowest possible esti?
mate, the average case of ty?
phoid fever costs $150. In
many instances, of course, the
COS! is much higher, owing to
the expense of nurses, physi?
cians' attention and loss of in?
come. Hilt even taking the
most conservation figures, the
0,008 cases of typhoid occurr?
ing in the State from October 1,
191 t to September ISO. l?l? cost]
the victims and their families
well over $900,000. This ropre
seated money actually spent
from savings, money lost in in?
come and nioney borrowed, of?
ten by those who could not af?
ford it. lo meet the expenses of
sickness.
"In addition to this, we must
reckon on the death of one in
ten of llo-.-e attacked by ty?
phoid fever. Every death rep?
resented the wiping out of a
wage-earner or a potential pro
ducer, for typhoid is a disease
of the producer and is not com?
mon among those who have
passed the productive age. II
we accept the lowest economic'
valuation of human life?so far
as life can he stated in terms of
capital?every death from ty?
phoid meant that a productive
power of at least $5,000 war.
destroyed. A ten per cent
mortality means the utter ex
tinction of more than ^.i.OQO'.OOfJ
in the greatest and most vital
wealth of tin- Stale. Funeral
expenses adding to this item
ami to tho cost of sickness,
would easily raiso the total lo
more than $4,000,000.
?'This would be bad under
any circumstances; it is infi?
nitely deplorable when it is re
moinberod that every case of
typhoid is preventable. If we
proceed from the well-establish?
ed fact that every case of ty?
phoid comes from the genus
that have left the body of some
other person Buffering with ty?
phoid, we see that when we
keep the germs from reaching
the bodies of healthy persons
in food or drink or through!
contact, wo are preventing ty?
phoid The winde law of the
prevention of this and all other
tilth borne diseases is bound up
in the simple rule?place the
body wastes where they can?
not reach anyone else in any
possible way.
"It is entirely for the people
of the State to say whether
they will continue lo pay ibis
awful price for a preventable
disease. The hoard of health
is glud to send free literature
to anyone who wants lo ascer?
tain how his typhoid bill can
be brought down to nothing."
