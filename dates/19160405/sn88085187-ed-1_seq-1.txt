It's the Year of Promise in City Politics, Too
The returrs from yesterday's city primary election make in
spiring reading for those who glory in clean, efficient govern
ment. For the busy little professional politicians who infest Ta
coma they are distinctly disappointing.
Pettit, the biggett-calibred man in the race, fittingly takei
the lead with a majority of considerably more than 2,000 over
Owen Woods. Btoever, once thought to be a leading contender,
is a poor third, and (ironen captures the fourth place after an ex
citing race in wl.ich he just noses out Stayton and runs a leant
200 ahead of McGregor.
For controller, Meads, incumbent, polls only about one
third of the total cast and enters the second race with Shoe
maker hot on his trail.
The charter amendment designed to strengthen the civil
service system carries overwhelmingly.
The Times cannot help feeling a little pride in the showing
made by Pel tit and McGregor. Early in the race Woods and

Btoever generally were picked for the first two placet on the
ticket, and McGregor was not considered to have a fighting
chance of landing anywhere near the top, As late as yesierday
afternoon most politician! did not think he would be among the
firsi ten.
Now Pettit comes in first, and McGregor fails of a nomina
tion by a mere 206 votes. While we felt, as we frankly slated,
that under the circumstances McGregor was slightly better
equipped to fill the position now held by Woods, we always have
maintained that it was a mere toss-up between him and Gronen,
and that either would be an immense improvement over Wood*.
AYe supported McGregor purely because of personal fitness.
So, the issue is clearly drawn all along the line. For council
it is the efficient, positive, do-something Pettit against the neu
ter, vague and unprepared Stoever.
It is Gronen, young, clean-cut, efficient, and technically
trained, against Woods, the politician.
It is two men who will vote right against one man who is

you. All the best men In the
prison use toothpicks morning,
noon and night. Of course, Mis-
Uh Wilson, if you-all don't want
to buy any, dats up to you."
At noon the prisoners came
back from the mill. A man whogej
blue-gray suit and cap were cov
ered with powdery dust, slipped
into my cell and clanged the
door.
This man had been celling with
his brother, who was also a con
vict, but the brother was in the
hospital 111, and they had given
me hia place temporarily.
My new cell-mate was a "five

all this in advance.
"How do you do?" I spoke up,
