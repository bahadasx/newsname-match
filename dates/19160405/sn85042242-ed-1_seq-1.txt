Minot, N. D., April 4.—The court­
room was again crowded as the Grant
S. Youmans case was called at 9:30
o'clock this morning. There was prac­
tically nothing new introduced, the
evidence being along the same line as
I he day before which was to show
that deeds, notes and mortgages
which were not collateral, nor of any
value, had been taken by Mr. You­
mans, On several different occasions
Youmans admitted, in answer to ques­
tions regarding a statement of truth
as shown by deeds that land was free
from incumbrance. He admitted that
lhey were false, (hat the statement
was false and thai he knew it all Hie
time.
State Rests.
Al ]0$:4.r» Assistant Atlorney Gener­
al Murphy, representing the state
hank board, announced that as fur as
this hoard is concerned, ihe stale
rests. lO.vaminni ion was then contin­
ued by Senator J'urcell, who repre­
sents the Second .National bank of
Minoi. Senator Purcell began ques­
tioning Youmans as to organization or
Ihe bank and attempting to show that
none of the capital stock of the hank
had been paid in as actual cash. The
witness admitted getting over $21,000
securities from a man named Carl Le
Waller, who it was alleged was a
transient and whose present where­
abouts is not known. Further ques­
tioning by Senator Purcell cpused
Youmans to admit that he has no
knowledge of any cash being put. into
the bank as capital stock. At noon ad­

Bank On Wheels.
When the court opened at 1:30 p.
m., the matter of real estate securities
to the value of $x8,38 was taken up.
Senator Purcell attempting to prove
that:: this amount was transferred
from-a, real estate comany to the bank
the same being on wheels at You
man's .convenience. This brought
forth another war of words between
Attorneys Purcell and LeSeuer. You­
mans denied having transferred this
amount from books of the trust com­
pany to the banking house, however,
a daily statement in one of the books
showed it under the heading of
"Banking and Lot" which showed an
entry ot $lo,i3S. Mr. Youmans said
that this eniry was a mistake in the
books, uiat cue banking house real es­
tate carried a vjuue of but IfSjoU:
However, it was later proved that tne
transfer of was made. In an­
swer to tne question wheiher tne
books showed tiiai this had been
Uiinsierred to tne bank and bacK
again to tne trust company, Voumans
answered "Ves, Sir. \vnen asked
how this was done, he said "I took
it out oecause was past April 1st,
and because the assessment was made
nad served its purpose to deceive
ihe assessor. 1 ciiu it to escape taxa­
tion and. alter that put it back into
the trust company."
Guilty of Perjury.
At this time, Youmans was making
a number of volunteer statements anu
the court ordered all evidence or vol­
unteer statements relative to any de­
fendant stricken out. Attorney i^e
Seuer state to the court that if all
was stricken out that the defendant
would stand guilty of perjury. Sev­
eral attorneys created some excite­
ment, all jumping to feet at the same
time and engaging in gestures and
words much to the gratiiication of the
Socialist and the curiousity seeking
audience. The court at this point
seemed to have his patience greatly
tried and used words and rapping on
his table said: "No argument be­
tween counsel." Several times the
court, instructed Youmans as follows:
"I have notified you frequently to give
answers,—now give direct answers
and not volunteer."
Taken Out and Put Back.
It was brought out in the evidence
that the superintendent of banks had
ordered Mr. Youmans to take out of
the bank the "Paul Grum" contract of
several thousand dollars. It was
shown by books that this amount was
taken out, but. immediately put back
in, and was carried as an asset of the
bank, notwithstanding the fact that a
letter was introduced from one bank
examiner telling him not to use this
paper as an asset of the bank. It was
apparently proven that Grant S. You­
mans had taken $100,000 in notes, pa­
pers and mortgages from strangers,
tramps or loafers of which amount he
admitted that $52,000 of this kind of
paper had been carried as assets.

Arrests Follow
a City Election
Kansas City, Mo., April 4.—A polit­
ical battle of great intensity, which
featured the most turbulent munici­
pal election this city has witnessed in
many years, resulted late today in
the arrest of James £5. Lapsley and
Col. Fred A. Lamb, police commis­
sioners, on charges of contempt of
court, after city patrolmen had ar­
rested more than 300 persons, all of
whom were held at police headquar­
ters under charges of investigation.
The commissioners were remanded
to jail by Judge Clarency A. Burney
of the circuit court, because they had
ignored a writ, of habeas corpus is­
sued by Judge llurney, that would
have freed the 300 persons arrested.
•Previous to the other incarcera­
tions, Captain Thomas J. Flahive, act­
ing chief of police, had been released
from the jail by Judge Ralph Lat
shaw of the criminal court, after hav­
ing been locked up several hours on
charges similar to those against his
superiors.
Following the arraignment of the
commissioners, Judge Burney issued
a 'writ of habeas corpus for the deliv­
ery of all the prisoners held at plo
lice headquarters.
Federalization of Miltiia Meets

DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
DECLARE LEADERS
Entire Day Spent in Spirited De­
bate on Military
Bill.
Washington, April 4.—The fate of
the federal volunteer plan of the
army increase bill was in doubt to­
night when the Senate recessed after
an all-day debate over an amendment
by Senator Lee of Maryland to strike
out the provision at the last moment.
Chairman Chamberlain asked that the
vole be deferred to 2 o'clock, owing
to the absence of a number of sena­
tors. Throughout the day confer­
ences were held by both the advo­
cates and opponents of the section,
seeking to enlist support of senators
who had not finally decided on their
stand. Senator Leo was aided in his
light by Senator Lewis of Illinois,
while Chairman Chamberlain and his
entire commitiee worked actively for
their bill and conferred frequently
with republican senators.
It is understood several senators
changed their position during the day.
Defeat Amendment.
The only vote taken was that which
defeated an amendment offered by
Senator Sterling of SoutliDakola, pro­
viding that the national guard should
be first called on for service by the
federal government, in Ihe event of
war, coming first after the regular
army in order of procedure.
There was no roll call. Chamber­
lain pointed out that existing laws
on Ihe volunteer army proposed al­
ready contained this stipulation.
In the course of the deba^e Sena
to Borah" of Idaho 'attacked'* the
scheme to federalize the national
guard as proposed in both the house
and senate army hills. 'He called at­
tention to the West Virginia coal
strike situation, declaring that, the
constituions of he state and of the
United States had been set aside by
the order then issued under which
military commissions tried those ac­
cused of crime. To place the nation­
al guard on the federal payroll, he
said, extended dangerous encourage­
ment to its use by state officials for
purposes outside the civil law.
Attacks Proposition.
He insisted that the effect of the
proposal was to federalize the police
force of the state, so far as payment
went, without assuming federal con­
trol of its uses.
Senator Thomas of Colorado de­
fended the federal volunteer provi­
sion.
Senator Reed of Missouri assailed
the feedral volunteer provision, as
did Senator Cummins of Iowa and
Senator Curtis of Kansas. Senator
Reed said he was convinced the men
to fill the volunteer regiment would
never come forward after the present
war excitement had subsided.
Senators Lodge and Weeks of Mas­
sachusetts vigorously supported the
provision. The latter said every state
should handle its police protection
with a constabulary system and not
call on the national guard for taht
duty.
An amendment to the section sug­
gested by Senator Clapp of Minneso­
ta was accepted by Senator Chamber­
lain. It provides that the federal vol­
unteers shall receive payment only
for the actual time in training serv­
ice.

committee as an example of the result
of "too much armor."
Speakers, who accompanied "gin­

"This Is gingo, the armored-Dinos­
aur. All armor plate and no brains.
This animal believed in huge arma­
ments. He is extinct."

against the French in the region of
Douaumont, northeast of Verdun, has
met with repulse, and considerable
losses.
In the same sector north of the Cail

their progress in driving hack the

The German attack south of Douau­
mont was launched against the
French lirst lines of defense, but the
French broke the advancing Teutons
with their machine gun and infantry
lire, forcing them to retreat in disor­
der northwest toward the nalfour

Alleged Meat Combination Scor­
ed by Former Governor
jStubbs.
JAIL SENTENCES,
NOT FINES, URGED
Washington, April 4.—Former Gov­
ernor Stubbs of Kansas and a former
Missouri judge, W. IL Wallace, who
said they had learned by raising cat­
tle themselves that, meat packers, by
price fixing combinations, were crush­
ing livestock growers, pleaded with
the house judiciary
sub-committee
to­
day to inaugurate sweeping reforms
in the packing industry.
Speaking on the Borland resolution
now before the sub-committee, which
would order a federal trade commis­
sion inquiry to determine whether
the packers are violating the anti­
trust laws, they endorsed the propos­
al strongly and suggested making
laws prohibiting the restraint of trade
in foodstuffs generally more string­
ent. Jail sentences instead of tines
were particularly urged.
iMr. Wallace, who prosecuted the
James train robbers, repeatedly de­
nounced the alleged packing combina­
tion.
"We are after a worse crowd now
than the James boys," he declared.
"These fellows steal more money in
a week than the James gang did in
their whole career."
By affidavit and testimony as to
his personal experiences, the judge
sought to prove that combinations
had existed among packers in the
Kansas City yards within the last
few years. He submitted an affidavit
from l^eo Burns, a former stockyards
employe, declaring that. Kansas City
and Chicago packing bouses were in
constant communication regarding
proposed purchases from speculators.
Arthur Meeker, vice president of
Armour & Co., promptly questioned
the accuracy of the judge's statement
regarding one buyer for I wo houses.
Waller Fisher, attorney for Ihe Amer­
ican National Livestock association,
interjected the declaration that, he
would be able to prove that such a
practice was not uncommon.

ford, after two years of prohibition,
voted for the return of the saloons.
Nearly all of the other towns in which
local options were held remain either
wet or dry as they had been before.
The voting dry of Moline was a

men rolleu np a large majority in fav­
or of retaining saloons.

The city of Waukegon, lying some
forty miles north of Chicago, had fur­
nished one of the few wet spots on
the north side of Lake Michigan in
Illinois. The election today threw out

Unconfirmed Report That Second
Group of Bandits Have Been
Defeated.
CHIEF SPEEDING TO
SOUTHERN CITIES
Lack of Railroad Facilities De­
lays Punitive E*pe#tic-''
Seriously.,
San Antonio, April 4.—Surprised
during their siesta, one of the groups
of Villa's force, driyen from Guerrero,
was defeated Saturday by.a sqi^idron
of the 10th cavalry under W. C".
Brown, according to information se­
cured by Gen. Pershing and forward­
ed to Gen. Funston today. In this
second engagement the American
troops have had with the Villa men.
The bandlits loss was estimated from
30 to 40 killed. No mention of Amer*
ican loss was made.
Major Evans reported that Satur­
day Col. Brown had encountered a
band of Villa's men, and was pursu­
ing them through San Antonio. Soon
afterwards, Mexicans, who arrived,
from that vicinity, declared that he
had overtaken the wandering bandita
at the village of Aguas Callientes, 20
miles southeast of Bachinava.
Villa's men, according to their ver
sion of the encounter, appeared whol­
ly unsuspecting of the presence of an
enemy before they were attacked.
It was about noon when Col. Brown
brought, his cavalry within easy range.
The Mexicans were lying about the
place, many of them asleep and all
their horses were grazing, in many
cases some distance from the men.
Details of the action were not told,
but the Mexicans said that besides
those killed the Americans captured
an equal number of horses. Gen. Per­
shing added that his report of the en­
gagement lacked confirmation, though
Jjitj credence-of the newswasisiifest
ed by the fact that he-transmitted it
to Gen. Funston.
Essential to Safely.
Engagements of that character, it
was said, may be expected now from
time to time, and the running down of
maurauding bands is essential to the
safety of the American columns.
The official admission of General
Funston's headquarters today that the'
success of the expedition now de
pended largely on the freer use of tne
railroads or the material strengthen­
ing of the long line of communication
and its branches, a situation that it
was believed might alter the entire
plan of pursuit.
Southward Shift
Villa's latest southward shift was
credited in official quarters since iC
came from consular reports in which
the outlaw was located well beyond
Chihuahua City and evidently trying
to reach Parral, or perhaps even Tor
reon, or Durango City.
In the vicinity of all those cities,
there are known to be opreating or­
ganized forces of Villa'? men, aggre
gating a strength of several thousand.
According to late reports Villa ap­
pears to .be travelling fast now, and
already has placed between himself
and the pursuing Americans a consid­
erable distance.
To meet the new situation, staff offi­
cers here assert a quicker means of
sending forward troops and supplies
should be made, and it was pointed
out that the direct Juarez-Chihuahua
railroad offered that means.
Two hundred American cavalrymen
under Col. W. C. Brown, Tenth Cav­
alry, defeated an equal force of Vil
listas in the second engagement of
the campaign, at Aguas Calientes, 30
miles north of Guerrero, on April 1.
This report was brought to General
Pershing today by two Mexican
ranchmen, who said that the Mexican
forces lost 30 men and 40 horses,
while the Americans suffered no cas­
ualties.
Villa Not in Band.
Villa was not with the bud, ao
cording to the ranchmen, who assert­
ed that the American troops believed
at first they had encountered the ban­
dit chieftain. An investigation show*
ed that he had not been with the de­
tachment.
For hours, the American cavalry­
men followed iManuel Lopez, one of
Villa's lieutenants, and one of his
bandits through tortuous, winding
canyons and almost impassable trails
of the mountains.
Believing that they had eluded
their pursuers, the bandits relaxed
their vigilance, and before they real­
ized it, they were confronted by the
troops of the Tenth cavalry of Otott*
eral Pershing's own regiments, which
bad been stationed near the town to
intercept bands attempting to* flfM
their escape. Only meagre dsolls of
the ensuing campaigns were hrqnfht
by the ranchmen, but tn many vis*
spects they resembled that of
a"
ago at Guerrero.
