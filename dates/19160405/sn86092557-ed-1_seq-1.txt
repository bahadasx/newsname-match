FOOD IK GREAT VARIETY
War Bread That Is Guaran
teed to Keep Fresh
Used.
BY LEON STARMONT.
Special Correspondent for T!:e West
Virginian fn Villa War Zone.
SOMEWHERE IX CHIHUAHUA, j
April 6?-One of America's enlisted j
Kipllngs once wrote words for the
array's bugle calls. Those for messj
call run:
"Porky-porky-pork. without any
beans.
And coffee, coffee, coffee, the mean
est ever seen."
"Them was the halicon days." as
my favorite war veteran used to re
mark. But they feed the soldiers bet
ter now.
When we dropped into camp for
dinner with the Fifth cavalry band
they were eating: beef loaf, gravy,
canned corn, boiled potatoes, rice put*
ding, coffee and milk.
For supper they had corn beef hash,
French fried potatoes, rice pudding
and coffe?.
And at each meal they have the In
evitable "war bread."
"War bread" is baked In a loaf three
or four times the size of that your
wife buys at the bakery. It has a
thick, hard crust, which preserves the
white, soft interior for long periods.
War bread will stay fresh where
that of the housewife would grow
stale. Want the recipe? Pass your
plate:
100 lbs. of flour, 6Mr gallons of wa
ter. 3-4 pound self-rising yeast. 1% lbs.
sugar, % lb. salt. "Add arm juice and
sweat to that recipe," said Baker W.
B. Waggoman and you got it.
The troops on the hike in Mexico
carry a field, ration with'tliem?bacon,
hardtack, coffee and salt and pepper.
They fry the bacon themselves over
open fires. But all the basos in Chi
huahua have commissary outfits the
same as those in Douglas.

64 YEARS AGO
Monongahela Reached Flood
Stage of Forty-Three

" """" ? '.?i.r.Mf !.<$? '?
SIxty-fonr years ago today. April
5, 1S52, occurred the great flood which
swept the waters of the Monongahela
and Ttgart's Valley rivers, destroy
ing thousands of dollars worth of
property and making homeles? ecorei
of rfcple of Marion county.
Tim flood began on Monday. Ap
ril G. and the wafers of both streams
rose repidly until three o'clock ou
Tuesday. The rivers roso at the rate
of five feet per hour during a portion
of this time, and the Monongahela
river at Fairmont attained a p>?rpon
dicular heigp ot 43 toot above tho or
dinary low stage of the water and
eight feet higher than the great rise
of 1807.
Tho destruction of property, espec
ially along the West Fork river, was
great, and on Monday forty houses
were seen to float down the Monon
gahela punt Fairmont. How many
j more floated down during tho niglu
of Monday wad not known.
Among thu buildings inundated by
the Hood and which float-iu down the
river were the mills of Mr. 'Jrtirin
of Harrison county, and Mr. I.ucns. of
Wortlilngton and tho mill and carding
machine house of Mr. Bioo. of Marion
county.
Practically the entire town o!
Wortlilngton waB swept away, one
houso and a portion of two others be
ing the only c;>es loft Claudius t*> tall

in that town being carried away. The
Paw Paw bridge at that point was
washed away and a little village,
known as Newport, on the opposite
side of the river, was completely in

Ths Tygart'a Valley did not reach
a flood stage, the greatest rise being
in tho West Fork.
The Fairmont True Virginian a
newspaper published at this time.' ea
tlmatpil the damage caused by ,the
flood at approximately $100,000. The
railroad suffered heavy damaga also.
The year 18B2 was an important
epoch In the history of this section, as
It marked the completion of the Bal
timore and Ohio railroad,, the build
ing of the wire suspension bridge,
which has since been replaced by the
present structure, spanning the Mon
ongahela river, and connecting the east
and; weit sides of the river, and the
greatiflood of April 6. 1852.
'A'galh .in the year of 1884 this sec

flocid which, swept th|B waters of the
Monongahela and its tributaries, the
West Fork and Tygart'i Valley. This
flood occurred'. on'. February 8, 1884.
The property damage at'this time was
great also.
