San Antonio, Tex., April Admit
ting that Francisco Villa had escaped
south, probably being headed for the
Tarral district. Gen. Funston today at
tributed tliis fail to misinformation
furnished by Villa sympathizers.
Funston stated that very few Amer
ican troops were pursuing Villa in his
flight toward the south, owing to the j
impossibility of further depleting the
line of communication without danger
to the expedition.
An air of pessimism prevails in
army headquarters here today. Hope
for tho early capture of Villa haB ap
parently been abandoned. Funston
admitted that the continuation of the
chase southward must be backed by a
Htronger force than is now availabla.
Funston stated thnt tho troops
available for the pursuit are now far
south of the scene of tho second en
gagement with the Villistas on April
1. No detailed official report on the
second battlo baa been received.
Funston is at sea concerning the
identity of the leadership of the band
which burned two bridges on the
Mexican National railway north of
Monclova but he believes that they
were Villistas.

FUNDS FOR
ROADS ARE
DIVIDED
Each District to Receive Equal Share;
Contracts for Dragging are Awarded;
Claims Passed on and Allowed
by Board
The board of county commissioners
has been in session since Monday and
it is possible that adjournment may
be taken this afternoon, the most of
the regular routine business having
been disposed of. However, it is pos
sible that the board may remain in
session one and possibly two days
longer. This will depend upon wheth
er or not the board decides to take up,
at this meeting, the matter of the cor.
rectibn of all erroneous assessments.
It was the duty of the board of com
missioners to act in such matters un
til these matters were taken out of
their hands by the last legislative act
of 1015. Tho extra session of the leg
islature, recently adjourned, how
ever, amended the 191a aci. so that
the board again has cognizance of
Buch matters. In event the commis
sioners should decide to make tnc
corrections at this regular term, they
will have a big bundle to dispose of,
which piled up between the time of
the passage of the J915 act and the
passage of the act of the extra ses
sion.
The gerater part of the session yes
terday afternoon was occupied with
passing upon claims. Something like
200 claims, including salaries of coun
ty officials, were disposed of.
It being shown that there was a sum
amounting to $2."00 i what is known
as the road-dragging fund, it was de
cided, upon motion, to divide this
amount equalty between the three dis
tricts of the county. This motion was
opposed by Chairman Corzine and
supported by Commissioners Robin
son and Bryant.
Final action iu the matter made the i
following disposition of the fund.
District No. 1, received for road drag
ging purposes the sum of $310; dis
trict No. 2, received for road dragging
purposes, $197; district No. 3, received
for the same purpose, $107. The bal
ance, The balance or surplus thus
left of the original fund amounting to
$l,59(i, was divided between the dis
tricts as follows: District No. 1, to
receive .i52.75; district No. 2 to re
ceive $)C1; district No. 3 to receive
$461. to be used for road construction
purposes.
The motion by which the abovo
matter was brought before the board,
and, which was acted upon in connec
tion with the above provides that each
commissioner be authorized to use the
money set aside for his respective dis
trict to be used for the construction
of roads In that district.
At the session of the board this
morning the road dragging contracts
were awarded and bonds of contrac
tors approved. The contracts award
ed follow:
Ralph Huron, to drag 4 miles of the
Verden-Chickasha road; V. P. Ship
ley, to drag 3 miles of the Pocasset
Chickasha road; A. II. Home, to drag
4 miles of the Alex-Ninnekah road.
Road dragging accounts and reports
were presented, approved and allowed

HOLDS COURT HAS
NO JURISDICTION
In tho matter of the State of Okla
homa vs. K. P. Campbell, charged
with violation of tho game and fish
laws in having caught certain fish
which the game laws provided should
not bo caught, the defendant was
brought before Judge T. P. Moore yes
terday and the court ordered the dis-
missal of the case on the grounds of
lack of jurisdiction.
Judge Moore stated that the statutes
declared what fish should not be taken
from Oklahoma streams but that there
was no statute providing a punish
ment. The court said that under
that provision of the statutes for the
offenses in which the penalty was not
fixed, the punishment was so exces
sive as to remove the cases from ju
risdiction of justices. "The matter
will have to be threshed out in the
county court," said Judge Moore.

FIGHT FOR
SENATE IN
INDIANA
State Republican Convention Opens With
Explosion Imminent; Attempt to Side
track Watson for Short Term
May Supply Spark
PROGRESSIVE ISSUE
RAISED ONCE MORE
Death of Shively Opens Way for Settle
ment of Contest but Anti-Watson
Forces Not Satisfied With
Proposed Deal
By I'nited Press. 1 '''
Indianapolis, Ind., April 5. Repuh
licans of Indiana at the state conven
tion opening here today knew thejr
were treading on explosives and that
the explosives bore tho label, "Jame
Eli Watson." - ,
Any attempt to sidetrack tho move
ment for Watson for the short terra
candidacy to fill the vacancy left by,
the death of Senator Benjamin F.
Shively might provide the spark for
a blow-up. it was hinted. Organization;
matters Including a keynote speech,
and selection of delegates to the na
tional convention constituted tho pro
gram for today. Nominations Will,
come tomorrow.
Harry S. New, who, by virtue" of S
big vote in Marion county, (Indlan
apolis his home, led Watson by sev
eral thousand votes at the direct pri
mary, was conceded the nomination
for the long term, which carries with,
it an opportunity to oppose Senator;
John Worth Kern.
The element that backed New tit the)
primary did so under a banner stat
ing: "He Can Be Elected," and their;
argument was that Watson, if noml-'
nated, would not bo uie to draw back
to the G. O. P., the progressive vcta
thatwent for Albert J. Beveridge two
years ago. The primary failed to nom
inate, as no candidate for U. S. sena
tor got a majority of the first choice,
votes. . .
With Watson's organization of vet
erans catching its breath after a cam
paign in which it had captured a ma-
jority of the counties and won a ma
jority of the votes outside Marion,
Watson issued a statement declaring
that so far as the primary was con
cerned his forces Intended to disre
gard the Marion county vote that
gave New his plurality and would
carry the fight against New to tha
floor of this convention.
Then Senator Shively died in Wash
ington. Watson hail no opportunity
to withdraw his unfortunate announce
men nnd anti-Watson forces have
tried to make him stand on it, but
Watson managers quickly intimated
tha Shively's death offered the oppor
tunity for a satisfactory settlement
of the New-Watson contest and that
they would be satisfied with the short
term for their candidate.
Indications were that there would
be an explosion today and that Wat
son would capture tho short terra,'
nomination by virtue of his flying col
umn of veterans. No other candidate
has had an adequate opportunity to
mobilize his forces since Shively'i
death.
This prospect troubled certain Re
publican editors who opposed Watsoa
in the primary as impossible of elec
tion because he could not bring back
tho progressives, they said. Watson,
on the other hand, in bis tight with.
New, pointed to the former Progres
sives who were aiding his campaign
and declared that wheieas he "worked
in the open" at the historic Chicago
convention, his opponent, New, waat
on the national committee that order
ed him to act as he did.
Will H. Hays, republican state!
chairman, appeared to be the choice!
of the anti-Watson men today follow-
ing the death of Shively, hut AVatsoni
called on Hays, and Watson men;
made it plain they would resent any,
interference by the head of the Re
publican organization; and a few days
later Hays announced that his duty;
lay with tho organization and that he
would accept the state chairmanship
for another term.
Since that time the antl-Watsonltei
hae chosen Fred Sims and Quincy Aj
Myers as their most likely prospects,
