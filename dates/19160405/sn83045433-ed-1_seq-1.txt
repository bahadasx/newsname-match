Chicago, April 4.-The dead

in use in the war is a flying
torpedo. It wipes out an entire
company if it lands within
twenty feet of the trench.
Such is the statement of
Lieut. S. C. Chapman, a Chi
cagoan, who enlisted in the
French army at the outbreak of
the war. He was wounded in
the fighting at Verdun, being
home on furlough.
"Verdun will never fall," he
said today. "The French have
enough artillery and ammuni
tion to fight the Germans for
the rest of their natural lives.
The Germans weren't touching
us when I left. With all their
great big guns they have only
one effective missile. This tor
pedo is about a foot and a half
long, and is winged," he said
today. "A soldier sends it out
from the trench by the aid of
a heavy spring, which he pulls
back. It travels about two hun

Unprecedented Tribute Paid to Loy

St. Patrick's Day.
By JOHN L. BALDERSON.

Brndkal
Somewhere in England. St. Patrick's
Day.-The King's voice was a trifle
husky. It was no public function, and
felt that he was alone with his troops.
Standing In the mMdt of a snall bar
raks square in the country a, mile tress
the nearest village. surkuunded by .20
brawny Irishmaen now traind and ready
to take the places of their comrades who
have fallen at the front, he had compli
mented the third reserve batallion of the
Irish Guards on the splendid showing of
its regiment in the field.
There were tears of pride and pity in
the King's eyes, pride for the heroism
of these men's comrades, pity for the
hundreds who have fallen, and perhaps
for these eager warriors so many of
whom. he knows, must soon suffer In up
holding the glorious, if brand new,-honors
of their organization. "After twenty-eight
days of incessant fighting against heavy
odds." the king faltered, "your batalion
came out of line less than a company
strong, with only four officers, a glorious
tribute to Irish loyalty and endurance."
He was speaking of the battle of Ypres.
The iron discipline which held the
soldiers fast in their ranks faltered
for a moment The men wanted to
shout their appreciation and love, but
his majesty pulled himself together
and went on In a strong voice, which
seined to me like that of Roosevelt,
without the Colonel's rather disagree
able rasp.
He spoke of the shamrock sprigs
which Queen Mary had just distrib
uted and which each man wore in his
cap. "It is the badge which unites
all Irishmen." he said. "May it carry
you to victory! In all trials to come
my thoughts and prayers will ever be
with you, and I wish you all good
luck!"

The names of the plotters were not given,

has been In progress for five days.
The plot originated in' El Paso. and
some forty persons on the American side,
