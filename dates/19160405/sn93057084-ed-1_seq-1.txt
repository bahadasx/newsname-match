The Indians of the Moreau river
district held a farmers' meeting at
the ranch home of Henry LeBean.
a few days auo. More than a score
of men and women were in atten
dance and much interest was shown
in the discussions.
Walter Swift Bird, late council
man. led the discussions.
The meeting was addressed by
Henry Hodgkiss, on "Better Farm
ing'" Henry LeBeau, on "Soils
that Produce Most'\ and Harry
Turtle Necklace, on "Better
Horses." All these speakers are
well-to-do Indians.
The Indians decided to effect a
a permanent organization and ap
pointed Frank Meeter as a Secre

CHANGE OF
PROPRIETORS
John Sternhagen and daugh
ters, Mrs. Robt. Voorhes and
Miss Annie, went to Gettysburg
last Friday, where the ladies re
mained to embark im the restaur
ant business, beginning April
first.
The News of last week gives us
the following account of the la
dies' new enterprise. Their many
friends and acquaintances will be
glad to see thetu prosper.
"Jas. Rafferty has sold his res
turant business to Mrs. Bob Voor
hes of Forest City who expects to
take possession the first of April.
Mr. R. retains ownership of the
building occupied by the restaur
ant and expects to fix it all up
with steel ceilings, new paint, and
other improvements for the new
tenants. Mr. Rafferty has been in
business in this location for 14
years and has seen many restaur
ant men come and go during that
lime. He says that it took him
longer to get rich enough to retire
than it did most of the others. He
and Mrs. Rafferty do not expect
to leave Getty sburg."
A petition was being circulated
in Gettysburg Monday for A. M.
Moore of Faulkton for candidate
for the republican nomination for
state senator to succeed J. F. \\hit
lock. Mr. Whitlock is not a can
didate for reelection. Mr. Moore
is a pioneer of Faulk-co and has
been very successful in the bank
ing business. From personal ac
quaintance, the writer knows that
he has all the qualifications essen
tial to an able senator, who will
take good care of the interests of
his district.—Potter County News.
The Press has received a copy
of Governor Byrne's proclamation
designating the first week in Mav
as CLEAN-UF WEEK. This
is plenty of time in which to g/t
ready. We hope to be able to
print it in The Press next week.
Miss Grace Gear has accepted a
position as apprentice in The Press
offiott, beginning Tuesday, it being
her "first experience with "the art
preservative." ..

Miss Orsborn left on Monday

Reports are to the effect that the
Indians when bringing in patients
or coming after medicine, bring
"the whole family" and camp at
the Hospital, making the duties of
the nurses of a strenuous nature,
and it was this that caused the
nurses to resign. *.
