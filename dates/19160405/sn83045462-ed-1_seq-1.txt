LONDON, April 5.?In evident
determination not to permit the
< lermans to retain the ground
they won recently in the YauxDomiiimoiit
rep-ion. northeast of
Yerilun. tlic French are continuing
their violent attacks there.
lY.ris today reports that ground
\\a> gained north of Faillette
wood in several engagements
fought last night.
The advance reported is in the
immediate neighborhood of yesterday's
battleground south of
Douaumont village, where the
(iermans attacked the French
lines with strong forces, but according
to the French war office
were swept back with heavy losses.
Previous attacks on the German
lines in Caillette wood had.
according to Paris, regained for
the French considerable of the
ground lost there in the furious
German drive of April 2.
There has been no renewal of
the fighting west of the Meuse,
but a movement of some nature
apparently is in preparation east
of the fortress, as an intense
bombardment in the Woevre district
between Moulainville and
Chatillon is reported.
Several small infantry engagements
have taken place in Lorraine.
the Germans~being repulsed
by French artillery and machine
gun fire.
Suffer Heavy Casualties.
1-. yesterday's fighting the (iermans
sustained heavy casualties, notwithstanding
the new formation of their
attacking; parties.
At Z p.m.. after the ground had been
battered by several hundred tons of
projectiles, a thin line of riflemen debouched
from t'hauffeur wood, near
!?ouaurnont. The Germans advanced by
short bounds toward the French
trenches, situated about 300 yards
south of the village. A second and a
third line followed at equal distances,
with small supporting and attacking
columns in the rear. This formation
has been noticed during the last few
lays, and is regarded by the French as
proof that the Germans have been sorely
punished in their previous assaults
In serried ranks.
Change Proves Ineffective.
But the change proved ineffective.
The first line of riflemen advanced to
within fifty yards of the French
trenches and there had to drop to the
ground under heavy blasts of shrapnel
and sustained musketry. The second
and third lines attempted to advance
to tho support or the first line, but
were stopped far in the rear by machine
gun fire.
The Germans in the first line were in
a. very critical position. Shrapnel
worked havoc among them. To charge
was out of the question, and as long
as they remained at the point to which
they had advanced they were exposed
to a decimating fire. The second and
third lines were little better off, for
they were within range of the French
three-inch guns. The entire attacking
force finally adopted the only move
open?retreating under a raking fire to
Chauffour wood. They left half their
number on the field. At least three
regiments took part in the attack.
Shelters Demolished.
The Fhauffour wood proved to be an
insecure shelter, for the French artillery.
increasing its range, covered that
entire area. It demolished shelters and
piled up the German losses.

by military critics as of great significance.

French Communication.
The text of today's French official
communication follows.
"in the Argonne there has been a
combat with hand grenades in the
sector between Holante and Fille
Morte. We caused the explosion of
t'.vo mines which damaged an enemy
t? ench.
To the west of the Meuse last night
passed relatively calmly. To the east
of the river we took part in several
engagements during the course of
which we made progress in the eorv?
Meeting trenches to the north of Call'
lette wood.
"In the Woevre district there, has
been an intense bombardment in the
r
sectors between Moulainville and Chatillon.
Tlie Germans threw in to the
River Meuse north of St. Mihiel twentytwo
mines. These floated down and
were exploded by us without causing:
any damage.
"In the i.orraine district the Germans,
after a violent bombardment of our
positions between Arracourt and St.
Martin, delivered several small infantry
attacks against various points in
this sector. The enemy was everywhere
thrown back by our machine
guns and the fire of our artillery.
"In the V'osges, a reconnaissance in
r?r> flit, tiart of t >i e- (>nemv. who
were endeavoring: to reach our trenches
to the southeast of Celles, was easily
dispersed.
"In the region of Verdun French
aeroplanes on April 4 engaged in no
fewer than fifteen aerial combats, during
the course of which a doubleinotored
(Jerman machine was brought
down near the pond of Hauts Fourneaux.
Another German machine fell
near the wood of Pilly, and a third
German aeroplane fell vertically to
the ground. All the French pilots got
hack without suffering damage.
"During the night of April 3-4 one of
our aerial squadrons threw down fourteen
shells on the railroad station at.
Xantillois. and five others on the barracks
of the enemy at Damvillers."
British Statement.
The British official communication
issued last evening says:
"Yesterday a German machine was
shot down by one of our aviators behind
our lines south of Souchez. The
pilot and observer were killed.
"Today the artillery of both sides
has been active about Souchez. Angres,
St. Eloi and Ypres. There has been
some mining activity about Xeuville,
St. Yaast. Hulluch and the Hohenzollern
redoubt."
German Official Report.
The following statement on war
operations was issued today by German
army headquarters:
"Artillery engagements in the Argonne
ami in the Meuse district are
continuing with undiminished vigor.
The situation is unchanged.
"On the left bank of the Meuse the 1
French were prevented by the tiermans
from again occupying the hill
northeast of Haumont. j
"In the Fort Douaumont sector yesterday
repeated counter attacks of the
enemy broke down before the .German
line, southwest of the fort and in front
of the German positions in the north
part of the Gaillette wood
"German troops in Lorraine and on
the Alsatian front carried out several
successful patrol enterprises.
"During the month of March in aerial
engagements on the western front, the
Germans lost fourteen aeroplanes, of '
which seven were lost in air combats. .
Three were shot down from the ground
and four are missing. The British and ,
French lost forty-four aeroplanes, of
which thirty-eight were lost in air |
combats, four were shot down on the
ground in our front and two were
forced to land within the German lines.
Twenty-five enemy aeroplanes fell into 1
German hands. The fall of nineteen
others was noticed." i

FOR Gf ORGETOWN PEOPLE |
Valuable Property Interests Built
Up Around Terminus of Pres- 1
ent Aqueduct Structure.
Georgetown residents who are makJ
ing an active fight to have the pro- !
posed new Aqueduct bridge located at
or near the site of the present structure
won a signal victory today when
their views were substantially incorpo- j
rated in a report on the subject sent ,
by the District Commissioners to the ?
Secretary of War. ]
At the suggestion of the Secretary <
the Commissioners conducted a hear- <
ing March 27 to obtain an expression ]
of public opinion as to the most de- s
sirable site for the bridge. George- '
town lined up solidly for the present '
site, but many residents of Alexandria ,
county and some citizens of Washing- t
ton favored a more eastern terminus.
<
Views of Commissioners. 1
Tn reaching their conclusion the Commissioners,
in their report to Secre- J
tary Baker, state that they give con- j
sideration to the following arguments:
"By reason of the long use of the
present Aqueduct bridge as a connection
between the District of Columbia
and Virginia there have grown up in
the old city of Georgetown, now West
Washington, valuable business interests.
These interests are of such a
character that it would seem very inequitable
and unjust to disturb their
! value by removing the existing means
of communication with Virginia which
would be involved In changing ma!
terially the present location of the i
j bridge.
! "A bridge located at this proposed
site would be a fixed bridge, without 1
a draw ; this would be so whether the .
bridge terminus were located either at
its present site, at 36th street, or at '
34th street. If the bridge were located ! 1
w ith its terminus at H street, or in i
jthat vicinity, the river traffic would M
I necessitate a draw similar to that in !
the present Highway bridge, and form ]
an obstruction both to land and river <
traffic. Such a bridge could not well <
the built high enough to avoid the i
I necessity of a draw." i ;
| 1
District to Pay Half.
i In conclusion the Commissi/*??,!.?, i '
oav. 1
"There is no doubt that the present '
Aqueduct bridge should be replaced.
Such replacement has been advocated j
for a number of years past, but until <
the present year it has been proposed 3
that the entire cost of a new bridge
be borne by the United States. This
year the Commissioners realizing the
great interest that the District of Co- '
lumba has in the site of the bridge i
and desiring to have some voice in the
determination of that site, have recommended
that the cost of the new bridge
be apportioned between the District of
Columbia and the United States as
o^her like Joint expenditures have been ;
or may be apportioned. 1
"In conclusion, the Commissioners, as 1
representatives of the people most <
vitally concerned in the location of this '
bridge, desire to recommend that the <
proposed new bridge be located at or
near the present terminus at .'{6th ]
street, and in any event no further
east than 34th street."

BKKLIN, April 5, via wireless
to Sayville, X. Y.?In the reichstag
today the imperial chancellor,
Dr. von Rethmann-Hollvveg.
made his most comprehensive
speech of the war. He reviewed
the military and political |
situation tin-* 11 co tt'irinne I
means of warfare and GermanAmerican
relations.
He protested vigorously
against the report that Germany
now or in the future contemplated
aggression against the United
States. He said:
"The latest offspring of the
calumniating campaign directed '
against us is a report that we, >
after the end of this war, shall I
rush against the American conti- i
nent and that we shall attempt to |
conquer Canada. '
"This is the silliest of all the
mputations invented against us.
Fqually silly are the reports that t
ive contemplate the acquisition of '
any territory on American soil as ,
n Brazil or in any American 1
country whatsoever. i
"We fight for our existence and i
for our future. For Germany I
and not for space in a foreign
country are Germany's sons [
bleeding and dying on the battlefield.
"Every one among us knows f
this and it makes our hearts and ^
nerves so strong. This moral a
force strengthens our will in nr-la
Jer not only to weather the
storm, hut also to achieve final 1
?? '
victory. c
Must Guarantee Peace.
The chancellor, whose address was ^
delivered to a crowded house, alsojt
?poke of the questions presented in re- 11
ation to the principle of nationality,!^
considering the Polish, Lithuanian, Uv- jt
>nian, Belgian and Flemish problems. 1
He insisted upon the necessity of guaranteeing
the peace of Europe after the i'a
war. and also of securing this result la
>y giving to these races opportunity t
3f free evolution along the lines of j t
their natural individualities and mother | p
ongues. i
At the conclusion of his address the|
chancellor elicited great applause by j
saying:
"The spirit of union shall lead us, as I g
it shall lead our children and grand- t
children, through the struggles of their
fathers, toward a future of strength '
md liberty." s
Reviews German Successes.
i
The chancellor began bis address with t
a review of the military situation. He t
stated that since his last speech in the j
reichstag the Dardanelles enterprise r
had ended as a failure, that the Serbian j
campaign, with the assistance of A us- i
tria-Hungary and Bulgaria, had been s
brought to a victorious conclusion, and c
that Monenegro and Albania likewise j
were now in the hands of Germany's
allies; that the British attempt to re- x
I1CVC nui-ci-niuaio, III lUuaMpunilIMa, j
had been in vain; that the Russians, ?
although they had succeeded in occu- *
pying Erzerum with superior forces, J
had found their advance checked by i
strong Turkish forces; that Russian attacks
against the front in east Galicia c
And Italian attacks against the Isonzo s
positions had been beaten back. More- y
[>ver, he said, the Russians had driven r
columns against the German lines, but c
their assaults had broken down before 1
Field Marshal von Hindenburg and his t
heroes. { ?
The chancellor declared that the re- t
ports of the enemies of this nation \
that the German military force had <
been expended were erroneous, as the
Verdun battle has proved that where
operations are prepared with great
foresight, and where the bravery of
Jerman troops is called into play, one 1
Advantage after another is obtained. t
Voices Thanks to Troops. c
The chancellor then expressed the i
nation's thanks to the soldiers and
their leaders. s
Discussing attempts which he said d
were being made to starve Germany, 2
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg continued:
"I understood that in 1915 our f
enemies would not give up this hope.
but I do not understand how cool a
heads, after the experiences of 1915, t
can cling to it. Our enemies forget t
that, thanks to the organizing powers g
of the whole nation, Germany is equal to i
the task of distribution of food sup- e
plies. e
"Our enemies forget that in cases in d
which there is a real shortage the Ger- t

nan nation is able to make use of
noral reserves which enable us to
lower our standard of life, which has
isen remarkably during the last decides.
What would it mean, for instance,
if the consumption of meat
should temporarily be lowered to the
evel of the 70s? I should think our
idversaries would remember how
strong was the German race of those
lays."
Difficulties Are Met.
Conditions of life in Germany were
lot easy, the chancellor continued, but
:he difficulties were being met in adnirable
fashion by the entire nation,
ispecially the poorer classes. The crop
eports indicated, he said, that all the
vinter crops were good, in fact, the rejorts
had not been as favorable for
nany years previously. The harvest of
1915 was the worst of decades, neverheless
the stocks of grain for bread
naking not only would be sufficient,
>ut provided for a considerable reserve
vith which to begin the new year.
"We shall not run short of anything
n the future, as we have not done in
he past," he said.

The chancellor declared it was the
ntention of Germany's enemies to
xtend the war to the women and chilIren
of this nation by starving them,
nd that for this purpose Great Brit-i
in and her allies have interfered with
he trade of neutrals.
"The American note of November 5,
915, gave an exact description of Britsh
violations of the nation's laws." he
ontinued. "but as far as I know it
las not been answered up to this day.
"No fair-minded neutral, no matter
vhether he favors us or not, can doubt ,
iur right to defend ourselves against'
his war of starvation, which is con- 1
rary to international law. No one can
sk us to permit our arms of defense!
o be wrested from our hands. We use .
hem, and must use them. We respect'
egitimate rights of neutral trade and ,
ommerce, but we can expect that this i
>e appreciated and that our right way
nd our duty he recognized?to use
11 means against this policy of starvaion,
which is a jeering insult not only!
o all laws of nations, hut also to the j
daincst duties of humanity."
Discusses Polish Problem.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, I
imid profound silence and the deep atention
of the house, turned to the
Polish problem and to that of nationilities
in general. He said:
"Neither Germany nor Austria-Hun
?ary intended to touch the Polish ques- j
ion, but the fate of battles brought
hem in contact with it. Now this
>roblem stands before the world and
leeds to be solved. Germany and
Vustria-Hungary must and will solve
t. History will not admit that after
luch earthquakes things will ever be:ome
what they were before.
"After the war there must be a new
Belgium."
Formerly Poland had been left in
he hands of a Russian police agent, a
nan named Tszhinovnik. Even mem>ers
of the Russian duma frankly adnitted
that Tshinovnik should not reurn
to the place where Germans, Ausrians
ami Poles have honestly labored
n the interests of this unfortunate
and.
"Mr. Asquith also mentions the principle
of nationality. If he puts himlelf
in the position of this unconquered
ind unconquerable adversary can he
eally suppose that Germany ever shall,
f her own free will, deliver into the
lands of reactionary Russia the naions
between the Baltic and the Vol,vni-'"'
swamps, who have been freed
>y her and her allies? No matter
vnei.i.r tney are Poles, Lithuanians
r Lavonian or of the Baltic."
Puts Blame on Allies.
The chancellor stated that if Gernany's
adversaries desired to continue
he slaughter of men and devastation
>f Europe the guilt would be theirs
md that Germany would have to "stand
t as men.''
He indicated in his speech that any
suggestions of peace on the basis of
lestruction of Prussian military power
vould make possible only one answer
?the German sword.
"Our enemies wish to destroy united,
ree Germany," the chancellor went on.
They desire that. Germany shall be
Lgain as weak as during the past cenuries,
a prey of all lusts of dominaion
of her neighbors, and the scapegoat
of Europe, beaten back forever
n the dominion of economic evolution,
iven after the war. That is what our
snemles mean when they speak of
leflnitive destruction of Prussian miliary
power.
SURVEY OBSERVING
CENTENARY TODAY
Coast and Geodetic Service
Inaugurated One Hundred
Years Ago.
CO-ORDINATION IS URGED
OF SCIENTIFIC EFFORTS
George Otis Smith Decries Wasteful-1
ness of Competition in Govern- i
ment Work.
One hundred years of existence [
of the United States coast and!
geodetic survey of the Depart-!
ment of Commerce is being cele- j
brated this afternoon at the New
National Museum. The celebration,
which began at 2:.i0 o'clock,
is under the auspices of the officials
of the coast survey, headed
by Dr. E. Lester Jones, superin?
. l '11 1. . . s
tenaeiu, ana win oe conimueu tonight
at 8 o'clock and tomorrow
afternoon, closing tomorrow
night with a banquet at the New
Willard Hotel, at which President
Wilson is expected to be present.
Speakers this afternoon told of the
co-operative work between the coast
survey and other bureaus of the gov|
ernment engaged in work along similar
lines.
The speakers today are Dr. Hugh M.
I Smith, commissioner of fisheries; Dr.
j Douis A. Bauer, director of the depart,
inent of terrestrial magnetism, Cari
negie Institution of Washington; Dr.
S. W. Stratton, director of the bureau
of standards; Rear Admiral J. E. Pills- :
bury, U. S. N., retired, and Dr. George
Otis Smith, director of the geological
survey.
The exercises were opened by Dr. E.
Hester Jones, superintendent, who spoke
briefly of the occasion of the celebration.
The work of the coast survey, he
said, is far reaching and fills many
phases of the governn^ent needs.
Pleads for Co-Operation.
Speaking of the economical co-operation
between the geological survey and 1
the coast survey, rather than the 1
wasteful competition. Director George 1
Otis Smith said the time was opportune 1
for government officials to pause and 1
consider the question of the regulation 1
of public business. i
"Do we apply the same rule to our
conduct of the business of these federal
bureaus that we advocate for the
control of corporations?" he said. "Here
at the federal capital we have some
two score scientific bureaus distributed
through several executive departments.
There exists no general plan or division
of duties among these different agencies
for public service, but as a fundamental
policy we have pinned our faith to a
sort of declaration of independence
that all scientific bureaus were created
free and equal, with the inevitable result
that some fields of scientific investigation.
are occupied by two or
more bureaus, other and less attractive
fields shunned, and even others perhaps 1
claimed by those not best qualified to ?
make the largest use of the opportunity
for work. This is the competitive system
almost at its worst, because it is
countenanced by men of scientific
training and high ideals of public
service. ^
"But, first of all, we must agree that, c
however great its advantage as a meth- r
od of stimulating progress, competition ?.
must be fair. If we are to apply the
principles of the Sherman act and the r
Clayton law to public business, unfair ^
methods must be ruled out as Illegal. \

ASKED TO HELP RESTORE
GEORGIA MAN'S MEMORY
i
Unusual Request Made of Secretary
Grant by Physician in a
S
Augusta. c
t
Of all the unusual requests that are ^
made of Secretary Thomas Grant of t
the Washington Chamber of Commerce, d
none has surpassed one received in a a
letter today from a physician in Au- ^
gusta, Ga., asking him to assist in an h
effort being made to restore memory t
to a man whose mind appears to be o
blank and who does not even know his 1
name. *
The letter was received from Willis
G. Wise of the University Hospital Of e
Augusta, a personal friend of Mr. *
Grant. In it he states that several f
weeks ago there came into his charge d
a young man suffering from loss of c
memory who has but the faintest recol- n
lection of his past. About the only s
thing of which he is positive is that a
he was a guest at a Washington hotel ?
from February 19 to 112. He believes
he was accompanied by his mother. He s
has apparently forgotten his name and ?
his place of residence. l'
Stayed at Hotel in This City. ?
The young man was able to give a u
irery meager description of the hotel p
n this city at which he stayed, but ^
Or. Wise believes that it must have t:
jecn the Raleigh or the New Willard. s
-le has asked Mr. Grant to obtain for fl
lim a list of the guests who stayed a
it both hotels during the period in
juestion. He believes that if the v
,oung man heard his name spoken he L1
vould recognize it.
Today Mr. Grant wrote to Manager
Jaight of the New Willard and Mana- a
jer Weston of the Raleigh asking for
l list of the guests at those hotels from .

Charles C. Glover, William and
Henry H. Flather File Motions
in Criminal Court. A
FEAR PERJURY CHARGES
WILL HOLD UP CHARTER
P
Statements Made That Controller of
Currency Would Use Pending
Indictments for Refusal.
B
Motions to compel the United States
attorney to assign an early date for the
trial of the perjury charges against
Charles C. Glover. William J. Flather
and Henry H. Flather, president, vice j^
president and former cashier, respectively,
of the Riggs National Bank, and
to require the government to specify q
more fully the charge against them
were filed today in Criminal Division 1
r>f the District Supreme Court by the
accused financiers. The defendants are
represented by Attorneys J. J. Darlington,
Frank J. Hogan, William G. Johnaon,
George P. Hoover and Daniel W.
J'Donoghue.
United States Attorney Laskey had n
decided to try the case May 8, and yes- '
ici uaj lasueu ouuputriicis iui iiie at- |j-|
tendance of two witnesses on that date.
Counsel for the accused bank officials ai
are not satisfied with this date, and
seek to have an earlier trial, declaring ft
they have importuned the United States
attorney on many occasions for a
speedy trial.
In the motion the statement is made SI
hat the charter of the bank expires .
July 1, 1916, and it is alleged that John 11
>kelton Williams, controller of the cur-ency,
has indicated before witnesses a r
purpose to deny a renewal of the char- ?
:er and to utilize the pending indictments
as a pretext for such refusal.
History of the Case. t<
In April, 1915, the bank filed suit ^
against Mr. Williams, Secretary Mc- ,
Adoo of the Treasury and others. ^
charging those officials with a conspiracy
to wreck the bank, and asking
that the court restrain them from such
efforts and from further persecution, c'
During the preliminary hearing, had tl
in May before Justice McCoy, Samuel tl
Untermeyer, chief counsel for the defense,
charged, in effect, that the Riggs e!
National Bank had been speculating in cl
stocks through the firm of Lewis John- ?p
son & Co.
Messrs. Glover, William J. and H. H. lc
Flather met that charge with an affidavit
asserting that the bank had never
bought or sold stock or made "short
Baies" through Lewis Johnson & Co. n
Following the submission of that af- a
fldavit the defendants introduced a r?
transcript of an account found on the _
books of Lewis Johnson & Co. showing
a great number of transactions, ap- n
proximately 6.000 in all, under the name
of the Riggs National Bank, and Sam- C
uel Untermeyer then described the ri
plaintiff's affidavit as "a grave abuse J
of the processes of this court." f<
Attorneys for the bank explained st
that the inference attempted to be f<
drawn from books of Lew-is Johnson & ri
~o. was incorrect, and that any stock st

Early Trial Sought. hi
On the day the indictments were filed. fi<
iccording to affidavits filed today, couniel
for the bank officials inquired-of the
listrict attorney regarding the earliest
ime the case could be set for trial, and
vas informed that trial before the
rhristmas holidays would be impossible th
tecause of the state of business in the Gi
listrict attorney's office. Immediately SCj
ifter the Christmas recess, the papers e<
iled today show, efforts were instituted m
>y the officers indicted to procure a fo
ill of particulars setting forth which te
f the approximately 6,000 transactions J
isted the government charged were for Al
he account of the bank, and seeking an ni
arly trial under the indictments. at
Then followed repeated and insistent At
fforts by counsel for Messrs. Glover, <
''lather and Flather to obtain "the ici
arliest possible trial," but these ef- P<
orts having proved futile, the defen- G<
ants made their formal arm^i
ourt today, according to the state- ar
lent in the motions. Mi
The affidavits filed today further ye
tate that as long ago as February 11, Sa
nd after repeated efforts on the part a
f counsel for the officers, the dis- su
rict attorney promised the defendants hu
uch a bill of particulars as they had ar
utlined. but that he has thus far failed th
o furnish it. ba
They also state that since January 3, en
ast, the district attorney in numerous im
onversations and letters has been >
rged to grant the defendants an op- sic
ortunity to meet in court the charge un
gainst them; that March 20 the dis- en
rict attorney was advised, in writing, ta<
hat the Postmaster General, Mr. Burleon,
had informed counsel for the deendants
that the Attorney General had
tated that the defendants could have I
trial as soon as they desired it. br<
Maifh 21, the district attorney ad- Th
ised counsel for the defendants that
e had applied to the Attorney General pla
ir the aid of additional counsel in the the
ase, and that he could give no definite ?.
nswer until after further conference
ith the Attorney General, and that he tai
nally, March 25, set May 8 as.the date the

into the Mexican interior

More Troops Are Necessary.
More troops are necessary, it is delared.
Gen. Pershing has ordered

stablishment of a sort of American
lasseur corps will be undertaken,

A Torreon dispatch places Villa at

If this be true, the bandit probbly
is proceeding along the old coach

rhence he could move on to Parral, his

Await Details of the Fight.
SAN ANTONIO. April 5.?Gen. Funon
today awaited a report, from Gen.
ershing giving more detailed inforation
regarding the fight between a
juadron of the 10th Cavalry and a
ilia band last Saturday, in which the
leiny was estimated to have lost beveen
thirty and forty men. In the
spateh, making bare announcement
' the engagement, no mention was
ade of American losses.
It is hoped at headquarters that the
;xt dispatch from the field commander
ill contain news of the whereabouts
' Villa. Consular reports received by
en. Funston have located him well

ive not beeji confirmed front military
turces. However, it is believed in of;ial
circles that the bandit has left
le Guerrero district and is moving

Jol. Brown's encounter with the Mexams

a.j. Evans of the 10th Cavalry halted
sterday. Maj. Evans reported that
turday Col. Brown had encountered

them through San Antonio, Chiahua.
Soon afterward Mexicans who
rived from that vicinity declared
