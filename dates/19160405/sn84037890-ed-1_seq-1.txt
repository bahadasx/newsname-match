HAS PERFORMED
Some Wonderful Feats In
the YiHa Chase.
MANY HARDSHIPS ARE BORNE
And Difficulties Overcome By
Our Soldier Boys On
the Trail.
HIKES IN STRANGE COUNTRY
With American Outposts in Mexl
cq to Columbus, N. M.t April 1 (by
aeroplane). Cavalry marches sur
passing all known previous perform
ances of mounted troops in Mexico
have been made in the pursuit of
Francisco Villi by some of the fly
ing columns sent out to cut off the
avenues of escapo of the Mexican
bandit. The diary of a cavalry off
cer, obtained to-day, gives a roman
tic sketch cf one such march. Names
and dates cannot be published. The
tirsr entry shows the abandon with
which tlic Americans threw tliem
selvpc Into the chase. -It says:
"We arrived with practically noth
ing to eat and no grain for the
liorses."
How. food was obtained in compar
ative plenty, for men 'and horses, is
also a military secret. However
some of the minor sidelights were
furnished by this officer's record.
"The night of March ," said the
diary, "we hiked all night, making
fifty miles, including a flfteen-mllo
climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet
over a terrific mountain trail. Wo
made camp at 8 a. m. and in the ev
ening started over mountain trails
8,000 feet high. In a march of 110
miles from our base we slept three
Tiours-.. -All .the. mountain trails were
"very bad.
"No sign yet of Villa, and no sign
of "beef. We saw one cow. Troops
got two deer. They kept the deer
and did not loan a bite to any one
pise. Hogs!
"Some of the men obtained rhu
barb, with which they made a very
good stew. We also got some ducks,
" hiked twenty miles, and I
sn worried about him. Later,
nas returned saieiy. tie located
wire and supplies for us. We were
to take five days' rations for men
and horses, but in order to make the
tljie we wanted, we took only two
days. Spent two days In high alti
tude In rain. The weather is other
"wise fine. We have been among
pines nearly all of the time, with
canyons and massive, rocky or bril
liant semi-metallic peaks, all about
us. The scenery is most wonderful,
much like Yellowstone, I imagine.
"Probably Villa could hide here
Indefinitely but ho would starve.
"Later, march resumed, making
thirty miles to a point where we ob
tained beef and one mess of beans."
The remainder of the diary, to
date, cited two further advances,
and then the trip of a four-man pa
trol, led by this officer, across a
range of.mountalns to receive orders
from one of the main line communi
cations. The diary recorded no in
cidents of the side trips as worthy of
mention, although when the patrol
arrived in the large communication
camp, its speed and daring was com
mended. To-day the same small pa
trol mounted its horses and gave the
big camp a laughing farewell, start
ing a long, hard, lonesome rldo to
overtake the flying column to which
the couriers 'belonged.
Scouting on foot, done by some of
the aviators, along with topographi
cal work, was brought to light to
day In one of the field camps. One
aviator's experiences began with his
landing after dark near the scene
of. a mountain side grass spot. He
said:
"About sundown, wishing to see
some of the aeroplanes, which had
been flying below me, and which had
disappeared agalqst the dark black
(fc1und of the earth, I gilded to a
level where I expected a see tho
other planes against tho lines of the
horjron. However, the other planes
ciiSfjgllded at the same time, so that
7 did not oee them, Soon after
dark,, while looking for a signal bon
fire, I saw what seomed to be a
"beautiful fire and descended to in-
vestfgute. I
"Observation was not easy at tho'.
I
G
timo because the plane was bucking
a head wind at an altitude of 5,000
feet. As I descended, tho fire re
solved Itself Into several small fires,
spreading out in a large circle. When
I was almost over tho lire It resem
bled the' view when looking from
above directly down Into a lake, with
piers running to the water. The
piers, I presume, were the tongues
of unburned grass, running in to
ward the center of tho burned area.
It seemed exactly like a lake of oil,
with the edges on fire. I dropped
low enough to dispel tho illusion
and see that it was a grass fire. Af
ter about twenty-five minutes' fur
ther flying I located what seemed to
bo a uniform slope on a mountain
side. It was not a slope, but this
was not discernible until the land
ing wheels of the plane struck tho
ground, when I discovered that In
stead of striking a Held, I had hit a
spur on the mountain side."
One of the disquieting experi
ences of night work In Northern
Mexico, especially when secrecy Is
desired, Is the abundance of game,
especially winged variety. Including
quail, which is repeatedly "flushed"
out of cover at the expense of con
siderable racket. On most of the
mesas it is so cold at night that
not more than an hour's consecu
tive sleep Is possible. There also is
danger of drinking alkaline instead
of pure water with subsequent great
physical exhaustion.

Washington, April 3. Depart
ment of Justice agents, following a
trail which Is said to lead to Amer
ican sources of suunlv for Franclscn
Villa, have uncovered evidence In
New York and other cities which
they believe will Justify tho chargo.
The allegation, often made, that
Villa has received nld from German
sources also Is being investigated,
but no Indication has been given as
to whether any evidence has been
found.
Tho department Is disinclined to
act on its evidence that American
money and supplies have gone to
Villa while It is In the stago that
will involve only subordinates. It
intends to pursue the trail, If pos
sible, to the men higher up.

OF BANDIT
Relentless Search By Un
cle Sam's Soldiers.
AMERICAN WYMEN POSH

Now Getting Bandit In
Close Quarters.
A VERY MYSTERIOUS KSCAPI-
Queretaro, April 2. Villa has lost
a leg, according to a dispatch re
ceived by the War Department from
the Municipal President of the town
of Temosachlc, Chihuahua, who re
ports that Villa was so badly wound
ed In the surprise attack recently
made on the constitutionalist garri
son at Guerrero that amputation of
the limb was necessary.
The War Department also has re
ceived a report of the engagement
between the United States Cavalry
nnd the Villa bandits at San Geron
lmo. The official report confirms
previous advices that the bandits
lost thirty killed and that the Amer
ican losses were negligible.
Gen. Pablo lurlga, Military Com
mander of the State of Jalisco, re
ports a battle between bandits and
Constitutionalist forces mder Col.
Salvador Ortiz, at El Grillo and Las
Canoas. The bandits were defeated,
leaving seventeen dead on the Held,
among them being their leader, a
notorious outlaw known under the
nickname of "Bolas Neal."
Trail In Snow Storm.
San Antonio. Tex., April 2. Vil
la's loss In dead at the battle with
Americans at Guerrero Wednesday
was placed at sixty by Gen. Pershing
tIUi!C 4nFU.or' t0 'eiu Fuust-01'-Tho
bodies were found In houses
In Guerrero and scattered In the
underbrush for miles along the
routes taken by the fleeing Mexicans.
Villa himself was believed to bo
northeast of Guerrero, but Gen. Per
shing expressed the opinion that
there was little chance of his es
cape. Detachments from four regiments
of cavalry had been disposed in such
manner that the district whore he
had been reported was practically
surrounded and every point of es
cape carefully guarded, according to
the report.
Gen. Pershing's report was dated
"March 31-Aprll 1" causing army
officers to believe it was written yes
terday, but not filed until tp-day.
Additional details of the fighting
about Guerrero were not given by
Gen. Pershing, but he said yesterday
that a snowstorm sweeping over tho
San Geronlmo ranch, a region of
high elevation, had madp the opera
tions of the troops more difficult and
exceedingly uncomfortable for the
soldiers.
Mysterious Disappearance.
Camp of Commanding General, at
t'io Extreme Front. April 2 (By
rer,oplane to Held headquarters and
by wireless to Columbus. N. M.)
Every slnca thoy defeated tho Villa
commander at San Geronlmo ranch
with heavy losses last Wednesday,
the American cavalrymen have
searchod ceaselessly for the bandit
leader, but up to late to-day no dofl
rlto information concerning his
whTPabnuts lwd rcacl'eil this camp.
Villa has disappeared In a way
which, considering the relentlessness
of the American pursult.soems mys
terious. Tho American troops have
not encountered nnv natives who
"111 even admit they have seen
Villa.
Troops Press Fonvnrd. .
Colutnbus, N. M April 1. Rid
ing lnorrllesslv, 400 American troop
ers under Col. George A. Dodd are
wnklng desperate efforts to capture
or wine out the survivors of Fran
cisco Villa's largest command, which
thov do'eated at San Geronlmo ranch
Foveral days ago. according to mea
ger reports seeping across tho bor
der tn-daK.
Other information received Indl
ratl. however, that there Is still
mvph doubt at tho American field
l'Pndnimrtrs as to whether tho ban
" chieftain was with his forces
living the engagement. One re
rort. given much credence, was that
Villi sustained the wounds which
ii'o:n bis leg nnd shattered his hip
bono in tho attack mado on the Car-
I
ranza garrison at the town of Guer
rero, March 27, and that the leader
was carried away by a few chosen
followers in a Jolting wngon to a se
cret hiding place In the wilderness
around Guerrero.
Although the pursuit by tho Amer
icans Is a new experience for Villa,
ono he has never met In all his years
of guerrilla warfare, army men here
are not Inclined to minimize the task
before Col. Dodd. Tho Guerrero
district In which Villa, with a price
on his head, wns able for eight years
to escape capture by Portlrlo Diaz's
ruralos, abounding as It does In
caves, canyons and almost Impassa
ble mountain trails, all screened
from the eyes of nlr scouts by heavy
growths of mountain pines, Is ad
mittedly ono of the most Isolated
regions In Mexico and the one In
which the bandit has the largest
number of friends.
Villi Him EsnipiMl.
San Antonio, Tex., April 3. The
fear expressed yesterday at army
headquarters that Francisco Villa
had escaped from the region In
which Gen. Pershing's cavalry col
umns are operating, became a con
viction to-night.
Gen. Pershing's report, received
after noon, contained the news that
at least a part of the dispersed Villa
force that was driven from Guorrero
March 29 still was moving In the
district northeast of that place, but
no mention of Villa's whereabouts
was made.
