THUS THREATENED
Third Judge of Local Court Said

v Chief Justice Robertson and
v' Circuit Judge Whitney
' WONT GIVEREASON ,
BUT CONFIRMS RUMOR
Strained Relations Among Lo
cal Wearers "of Ermine Laid
to His Outspoken Sentiments
Thomas - D Stuart,' third judge of
the first circuit court, Honolulu, has
: sent his resignation to the department
; of Justice, in Washington, D. C.
;' When confronted today with a re
v lort from an authentic source to the
effect that he was contemplating re
i signing, Judge Stuart simply stated
i . that hla resignation la already In
Washington.. It Is believed, the resig
J5 nation' went by cablo either yesterday
or the previous day. . ,
"Will vou state the reasons for your
resignation r the Jurist was asked.
There la no need ta .state any
causes," he anjwered. ; "But I see no
t reason why the fact that I have ten
' dered' my resignation should not be
' made public" - ' -
, Judgo Btuart was asked to confirm
a report to the effect that he had stat-
fd ta a local attorney that he would
';" jeslgn if the nominations of Chief Jus
tice A.-O. Robertson and Circuit
. ; V Judgo William L.' Whitney, were con
: finnerty the senate. - "
-f'Thire 1 no iieed to say anything
. about that," Judge Stuart said. "Just
;ray that in 'an interview with Judge
i Stuart as to the probability of his
.r. trc"?. . leititoitha its. resfgna
'ttoa wasalready ia- Yaingto.!r.l.'v,
Tbej CUr-CuilEtla" earaed today
frora authoritative sources lhat some
' time ago Judge Stuart informed the
. department-of Justice that if Judges
Robertson and Whitney were retained
he would resign.
' They were retained ' J
Strained. i relations . with. Circuit
v Judges Ashford and Whitney, as well
as with Chief Justice Robertson and
' Governor PlnkJiam, are believed to be
the reasons for Judge Stuart's resig
') nation. During the last year Judge
Stuart filed in circuit court . a suit
i against Governor Pinkham in which
' he condemned the homestead policy
i of the chief executive, following it up
-j, with open lettera to the press giving
, ' further light on his own idea of the
homestead situation. ., The governor s
; demurrer . to th complaint was sus-.
tained oy Circuit Judge Ashford, thus
rlcslng the matter as far as the lower
court was concerned. Judge Stuart
'. baa never taken the case, to the su-
jreme court
- Prior to the bringing of the suit, and
while the matters of the reappoint
ment of Chief Justice Robertson and
Judge Whitney were pending Judge
Stuart filed, with the "department of
Justice an affidavit la which, it is un
derstood, the chief justice. Associate
Justice E. M. Watson, and Circuit
Judges Ashford an1 Whitney were
flayed. . While admitting, at-the time
; that some .auch affidavit had been
sent to Washington, Judge Stuart de
clined to mak-3 it public.
Only recently Judge Stuart wrote an
open letter to local newspapers In
which he advocated commipslou gov
ernment for the. territory of -Hawaii,
' and criticized the present territorial
government under Governor Pinkham,
as well as the government of the city
and county and the conduct of the lo
cal courts. '
.Yesterday afternoon the Star-Bul-lMn
received a cablesram from its
Washington correspondent to the ef
feet that the reapiwintmenU of Chief
Justice Robert-ion and Circuit Judge
Whitney had been confirmed by the
. senate.
Since Judge Stuart says that his
refiiznaUon is already "in Washing-
ton,- it is presumed it went by cable.
Young Sui, American-Chinese, Is
Now An International Question
Youne Sui. an American-born Chi
nese living in Hilo, has been the sub
ject of much discussion on the part
of the Chinese government Recently
It was runtored that Young Sui would
.go to China on a visit and then the
trouble sUrted. The local representa
tive of Yuan Shih-Kal, Consul Tsz-ang
Woohuan is accused of being the orig
inator of the discussion by a Chinese
publication.
One of the leading newspapers in
II?ong Shan in the province of Kwan
tung has this to say of the American
citteen: ' . .,
"The district governor has been au
thorized by the civil governor of Can
..ton throueh Consul Tsz-ang Woohuan
of Honolulu that the police in all of
the districts of Kwantung be advised
to; arrest one Hawaiian-born Chinese
about 29 vears of age, who goes by. the

with a review of th'e;military situa
tion. He stated that since his last
speech in the Reichstag, the Dar
danelles enterprise of the Allies ha3
ended as a failure ; that the Serbian
campaign, together with" the ; Aus-tro-Hungarian
and Bulgarian Al
lies, wav brought to a victorioiii
end ; that-Montenegro and Albania
likewise are now in the hands of
the German allies; that the English
have , attempted in vain to relieve
their force at Kut-EI-Amara; that
the Russians have succeeded in oc
cupying ; Erzerura With superior
forces ; that the Russian attacks
against the front in east Galicia and
the Italian attacks against the Ison
zo position have been beaten back.
The Russians, he continued, als'o
drove their columns against the
German lines but they broke down
before the resistance of von Hin
denburg and his heroes. The ene
my's reports that German military
force has been used up he branded
as erroneous. .- The Verdun battle.
Tie asserted, proves that where the
operations are prepared with pro
found foresight and where the
bravery of the German troops is
tested, there is one advantage after
another gained.' v
The chancellor - then expressed
the nation's thanks to the soldiers
and their leaders. Discussing the
question
of . "Starving Germany
out. he said:.
"I understood that the enemy, in
1915 would not give up this hope,
but I don't . understand how cool
heads, after the experiences of
1915, can still cling to it. Our ene
mies forget that, thanks to the or
ganizing power of the whole nation,
Germany .is equal to the task of
the distribution, of .victuals. They
forget that the German nation in
case of a real scantiness disposes o
imposing moral reserves, which en
able us to lower our standard of
li f e, which had : risen remarkably
during the last decades.
"What would it mean if for in
tance the consumption of' meat
would temporarily be lowered to
the level of the 70's? I should
think that our adversaries would
remember how. strong was the Ger
