Appeals for haste in getting the rail

Juarez through Chihuahua to Torreon.
It is understood he is anxious to move

West of the Meuse there were no

Invaders Lose Ground.
In yesterday's fighting around Ver
dun the German lost considerable
ground and again sustained heavy
casualties notwithstanding the new
formation of their attacking parties.
At 3 p. m. after the ground had
been battered by several hundred tons
of projectiles, a thin line of riflemen
debouched from Chauffeur wood a
little to the northwest of Douaumont.
The Germans advanced by short
bounds towards the French trenches,
situated about 300 yards south of the
village. A second and a third line fol
supporting and attacking columns
the rear. This formation has been
noticed during the last few days and is
regarded by the French as proof that
the Germans have been sorely pun
ished in their previous assaults in
serried ranks.

But the change proved ineffective
The first line of riflemen advanced to
within fifty yards of the French

advance to the support of the first line
but were stopped far in the rear by
machine gun fire.

In a very critical position. Shrapnel
worked havoc among them. To Charge
was out of the question and as lonj
as they remained at the point to which
they had advanced ther were exposed
to a decimating fire. The second and
third lines were little better off, for
they were within range of the French
three inch guns. The entire attacking
force finally adopted the only move
open, retreating under a raking fire to
Chauffeur wood.
Three Regiment in Charge.
They left half their number on the
field. At least three regiments took
part in the attack. The action of yes
terday is regarded by military critics
as of great significance, showing that
the Germans even with their new for
mation are unable to escape the fu
rious responses of French artillery:
that the French positions, though they
may be vulnerable at certain local and
exposed points, cannot be shaken, and
that the French counter offensive Is

RAIN PASSES US BY

Part of the State.
Heavy rains fell in several parts of
Kansas last night although the prom

! where rain was most needed. The
greatest amount of precipitation was
reported at Coldwater, Comanche
county, where the total was 1.32
inches. Wichita received 1.14 inches
last night and it was still raining
j there this morning. Temperatures
! were generally low over Kansas and
i little change is expected in the next
j 48 hours. The lowest reading in the
i state was 28 degrees at Phillipsburg.
The forecast calls for partly cloudy

The mercury at Topeka tonight prob-
ably will reach the same mark
: this morning's low reading which was

MUST FACE LOSS!
Railroads of Kansas Given Blow i
by Utilities Commission.
Coal Rates To Be Based on j
Weight at Destination.
TRANSIT SHRINKAGE IS COSTLY
One Car, for Instance, Proved
Decrease 6,000 Founds.
Traffic Men Declare Point of
Shipment Weight Is Fair.
Kansas railroads encountered a new
brand of trouble before the public
i utilities commission today. As the re
sult of a hearing now before the com-
: mission, coal rates may be based on
weights at destination. Then, too, rail
roads may be compelled to stand ex
pense for loss and shrinkage in tran
sit. It is a new and serious source of
trouble that faces the railroads. Asa
result nearly all of the lines in Kan
sas are represented at the hearing
which was called this morning. Wit
nesses were called before the commis
sion by a number of coal companies
ad both the distributing and produc- j
ing companies as well as the dealers I
told their troubles.
One company today declared that a 1
car of coal shipped a distance of 535
miles showed a loss of 6,000 pounds
or three tons in net weight when it
reached destination. Claims for the
shortage were filed with the railroads
handling the coal, but these claims
were never paid. Other losses were
claimed and in almost every instance
the railroads had failed or refused to
make good the shortages.
Coal is shipped from the Kansas
mines based on weights at point of
shipment. Losses which result in
transit must be recovered through
claims filed with the railroads. It is :
contended that the coal dealers lose
both ways. They claim a loss in coal
and an overcharge in rates. For that
; reason they want a rate based on net
weights at destination. They also
want a ruling from the commission
affecting the payment for losses of
coai when a difference is shown in
weights between shipping and receiv
ing points.
One complaint before the commis
sion today concerned the failure of the
company to give actual weights of
cars at point of shipment. From u
number of points in the southern Kan- '
sas coal fields, it was asserted, ship
pers have been compelled to accept ;
empty cars at stencil weights shown on
the cars. The cars are not actually
weighed in before being loaded, it was :
claimed. On all of these points the ;
coal men claimed losses and they want
relief through the department.
Railroad representatives will intro
duce evidence to show that the only
: fair charge is based on weights at
poin of shipment. Many of the losses
in weights, they claim, are due to th"
! handling of a shipment by connectina
, roads and expenses cannot be equally
I or justly apportioned.
The hearing may occupy the atten-
tion of the commission for two day 4. ;
Following this hearing, the commis-
jsfon will take up a controversy con
. cerning weights of grain and appor- :
Itionment of rates by the Kansas rail- ;
roads. j

the bandit chief probably is headed

it is impossible to send a considerable

of the necessity of protecting the line

this requirement.
Hope of an early successful ending

Berlin. April 5 (by wireless to
Sayville). Chancellor Bethmann
Hollweg protested vigorously In the
reichstag today against the report that
Germany now or in the future con
templated aggression against the Unit
ej States.
The chancellor indicated in hia
speech also that any suggestion of
peace on the basis of destruction fft
Prussian military power would make
possible only one answer the Ger
man sword. He stated that if Ger
many's adversaries desired to continUO
the- slaughter of men and devastation
of Europe that guilt will be theirs ana
that Germany would have to "stand It
as men."
Regarding tl e United States situ
ation the chancellor said:
"The latest offspring of the calum
niating campaign directed against us
is a report that we, after the end o
this war. shall rush against the Am
lean continent and that we shall at
tempt to conquer Canada.
"This is the silliest of all imputa
tions Invented against us. Equally
silly are the reports that we contem
plate the acquisition of any territory
on American soil as in Brazil or in
any American country whatsoever.
"We fifrht for our existence and for
our future. For Germany and not for
space in a foreign country, are Ger
many's sons bleeding and dying on the
battlefield.
Sees Final Victory.
"Every one among us knows this
and it makes our hearts and nerves
so strong. This moral force strength
ens our will in order not only to
weather the torm. but also to achieve
final vicTory."
The chancellor, whose address was
delivered to a crowded houM, also
spoke of the questions presented in
relation to the principles of national
ity, considering the Polish, Lithua
nian, Livonian, Belgian and Flemish
problems. He insisted upon the ne
cessity of guaranteeing the peace of
Europe after the war and also of se
curing this result by giving to these
races opportunities of free evolution
along the lines of their natural indi
vidualities and mother tongues.
At the conclusion of his address the
chancellor elicited great applause by
saying:
"The spirit of union shall lead us.
as R shall lead our children am
grandchildren through the struggles
of their fathers, toward a future of
strength and liberty."
Reviews Military Victories.
The chancellor began his add reus
with a review of the military situa
tion. He stated that since his last
speech in the Reichstag, the Darda
nelles enterprise had ended as a fail
ure, that the Serbian campaign, with
the assistance of Austria-Hungary and
Bulgaria, has brought to a victorious
conclusion and that Montenegro and
Albania likewise were now in the
hands of Germany's allies: that taa
British attempt to relieve Kut-t.
Amara in Mesopotamia had been tn
vain; that the Russians, although they
had succeeded in occupying Erzerutt
with superior forces, had found their
advance checked strong Turkish
forces, the Russian attacks against
the front in east Galicia and Italian
attacks against the isonzo position
had beaten back. Moreover, he saia
the Russians had driven column
against the German lines but their
assaults had broken down befora
Field Marshal von Hindenburg and his
heroes.
The chancellor declared that the
reports of the enemy of this nation
that the German military force had
been expended were erroneous as the
Verdun battle has proved that where
operations are prepared with great
foresight and where the bravery of
German troops is called into play, ons
advantage after another i obtained.
The chancellor then expressed th
nation's thanks to the soldiers and
their leaders.
Trying to Starve Germany.
Discussing attempts which he said
were being made to starve Germany,
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg continued:
"I understand that in 1915 oar
enemies would not give up this hope,
but I do not understand how cool
heads, after the experiences of 191$.
can cling to it. Our enemies forgsH
that, thanks to the organizing powers
of the whole nation, Germany is equal
to the task of distribution of food sup

in which there is a real shortage, ttfta
German nation is able to make use of
moral reserves which enable us te
lower our standard of life, which has
risen remarkably during the lasjt
decade. What would it mean, for in
stances, if the consumption of mesjt
should be temporarily lowered to tho
level of the '70 s. I should think otf
adversaries would remember how
strong was the German race of thoit
days."
Crop lropect- Good
Conditions of life in Germany wen
not easy, the chancellor continued, butt
the difficulties were being met in ad
mirable fashion by the entire natiott,
especially the poorer classes. Th
crop reports indicated, he said that
