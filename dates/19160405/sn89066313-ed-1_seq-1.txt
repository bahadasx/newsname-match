POINTS TO DEFECTS
IN SOCIAL SYSTEMS
J
Lionberger Davis at As
sembly Criticises Scbools
and Government.
NEED GOOD LEADERS
Says University Men and
Women are Necessary to
Remedy Evils.
The complacency of self-satisfied
Missouriaus, unwilling to see flaws in
their state institutions, must have suf
lered a hard jolt when J. Lionberger
Davis of St. Louis, vice-president of
the St. Louis Union Trust Company,
pointed out in his address on "Educa
tion and Democracy" at the Univer
sity Assembly last night several de
fects in the state government and edu
cation, especially in the rural school
system.
The situation is serious," said Mr,
Davis. "It is due to stupid and sel
fish leaders, men who sere the spe
cial interests of a class and not of
all people. We have a chronic and
serious problem of unemployment. In
St. Louis last year, 75,000 persons
were out of work. Our justice Is a
farce. Our housing question bril
liantly exemplifies our stupidity in
dealing with problems.
uw Problems Confront Us."
"Our problems of today are not the
problems of 100 years ago, or even
30 years ago. To a large extent we
have solved the question of produc
tion, of taking advantage of our nat
ural resources. Now we hac the
greater problem, that of the distri
bution of wealth.
"We have less democracy than we
imagine. For a long time we thought
we were governing ourselves, but we
woke up to find ourselves gulled, gov
erned by an 'invisible government,' if
you'll permit me to use that maga
zine phrase. A boss was dictating our
elections and the distribution of our
offices.
"I'm not afraid of socialism," the
speaker continued. "I think it's a
splendid thing, but I am afraid that
many of us do not know what it means.
The state university and the municipal
waterworks are forms of socialism."
Mr. Davis asserted that the only
cure for the present evils was intelli
gent, enlightened, unselfish leadership,
combined with a strong interest on the
part of the people in the administra
tion of government.
"Office-Holders 31 us.t lie Unselfish."
"We have got to produce educated
men and women for I believe in
woman suffrage to hold office. They
must be unselfish. If we don't put
men into office who will serve all
the people, instead of a class, we have
only the forms and trappings of de
mocracy and not the real thing.
"It seems that 97 per cent of the
people are interested in the policy
making, the legislative function of
government. Why, policy making is
only about 3 per cent of government.
Administration is 97 per cent. And
the people must learn to take an in
terest in the working of the adminis
tration. We've got to take a strong,
not a passive, interest in this admin
istration. To philosophize and theo
rize is futile. It is up to you University
men and women to go out and lead, to
go out and fight the evil and sinister
influences that are dragging our de
mocracy in the mire."

BURNS CANCELED DEBT
Mayor, With Council, De
stroys Bonds, Has Banquet
and Receives Pay.
A small pile of ashes is all that re
mains of a $100,000 debt of the city
of Columbia. Shortly after C o'clock
yesterday evening, the mayor and City
Council gathered near the old court
house columns and ceremoniously ap
plied a match to $100,000 worth of
canceled bonds. J. S. Ilicknell, city
clerk, brought the bonds from the city
hall to the scene of the burning, where
they were soaked with kerosene to
hurry the ceremony, as the members
were anxious to get to the banquet
prepared for them at the Athens Hotel
by Mayor Batterton. The mayor ap
plied the match, and in a few min
utes all was over.
Then all proceded to the banquet
as Mayor Battcrton's guests. Those
present were: Councilmen Kellogg,
Klass, Shaw, Davis, McDonnell and
Hawkins; Councilmen-elect Lee Wal
ker and J. H. Reid; D. H. Rowland,
31. E. Fawks and J. S. Bicknell, city
clerk.
Mere routine business was trans
acted at the council meeting after the
festivities at the mayor's hospitable
board. The members unanimously ap
proved the order to pay the salaries of
the mayor and councilmen. Mayor Bat
terton received his check for $400, and
each of the eight councilmen received
his check for $100.
The following sums were appropri
ated out of the various funds for the
current monthly expenditures: water
and light fund, $2,194.46; security
fund, $95; general revenue fund, $3,
319.70; poor fund, $75.14.
A-tota lof $124.25 in fines was col
lected during March.
The meeting marked the completion
of the terms of two of the council
men, James It. Lipscomb and E. G. Da
vis. They were not candidates for re
election. The meeting was adjourned to meet
next Monday night, when the ballots
of yesterday's election will be checked
up and the new councilmen more or
less formally installed.
When 13-or 14-year-old boys are
brought up in Circuit Court charged
with burglarly and larceny there is
something wrong with the home life
of those boys. Judge David II. Har
ris told a mother and a father who
came into court late yesterday aft
ernoon to ask leniency for three boys
who confessed they broke into W. B.
Nowell's store March 27.
The boys were Earl Hawkins, Hu
bert Branham and LeRoy Day. The
father of Branham and the mother of
Day were in the courtroom. Hawkins
lives in Columbia, but no relative was
interested enough to attend his trial.
"What is this country coming to?"
said Judge Harris after he had heard
the confessions of the boys. "Twenty
fix c years ago when I entered the legal
profession it was the rarest thing that
a boy was brought into court. It Is
an everyday occurrence now.
"These boys have confessed to a
serious crime, but what is a judge go
ing to do? To send them to a reform
school until they are 21 years old
might graduate them into a life of
crime.
"There is something wrong in the
nome lire of these boys. If parents
would take half as much interest in
their children before they get into mis
chief as they do in helping them out
of court after they arc caught In mean
ness, we would be a lot better off.

said she couldn't control her son, "and

ant At 4 o'clock this afternoon the jur
was still out in the case of Hubbard
and Son against the Morris Brothers
Taxicab Company. The plaintiffs are
asking $300 damages on a horse which,
they claim, was injured when one of
Morris Brothers' taxicabs ran into it
last December.
How to rid Columbia of promiscu
ous begging and promiscuous giving
is occupying the time of the Charity
Organization Society, which had its
regular monthly meeting in the Com
mercial Club rooms Monday and heard
the report of the secretary and the
field agents. The subject was brought
up by Mrs. L. L. Bernard, and the so
ciety resolved to make a plea to the
citizens of Columbia to aid the so-j
ciety in suppressing it.
That it is not only a moral weak
ness but a moral wrong to respond to
promiscuous begging is the firm be
lief of Prof. O. D. Kellogg, who is a
director of the organization.
Easier to Give Than to Refuse.
"For the average person," said Pro
fessor Kellogg, "it is easier to give
than to refuse. A short time ago I
responded twenty-five cents' worth to
a woman who assured me with a
written and wrinkled plea that she
had been left homeless by a devastat
ing tire and that she was asking for
money to rebuild. The response on
my part was sheer weakness, for I
believe in an organized charity which
has time and opportunity to make sure
it isn't helping to encourage idleness
and indigence.
"I followed the line of least resist
ance, however, and gave her the
quarter. Besides, her wrinkled list of
donations was headed by $20 from one
of Columbia's most astute business
men and followed by generous do
nations from many others. This, to
a casual thinker, would seem a guar
antee that the woman's cause was
worthy.
"However, upon Investigation our
field agent, D. E. Major, found that
while it was true that her house had
been burned it was also true that she
owned valuable farm land and was
far from being an object of charity.
Has Husky Husband But Begs.
"Another woman, who has a husky
husband, begs regularly with a baby
on her arm. She asks for work, but
the stage, of course, is set for charity
starving mother, helpless baby, big
appeal."
These, Professor Kellogg declares,
are two of many similar nuisances
which the charity organization would
like to abolish, but which it cannot
reach so long as Columbians make
professional begging profitable. The
organization has a field agent who
gives his entire time to investigating
and helping charitable cases and who
has carefully studied food problems
until he can make a minium sum go
a maximum distance in furnishing food
to the needy.
The organization begs that all cases
of this kind be turned over to the field
agent and not helped hit or miss.
