'NPIANAI'OI.IS. April .". Thous
ands of republicans from all points
in Indiana crowded int Tomlinson
hall this afternoon to hear Judge
cuincy A. Myers pen the 1916 con
vention In his keynote address. The
hall wa.s ablaze with color and bands
supplied Inspiring music while the
hi? hall was beinpt; tilled. The aft
ernoon whs given over to speeh
making and a general get-together
program. livery seat in the hall was
taken before Judge Myers took the
floor at 2 oYlock to call the me't
in' to order.
In his keynote address. Judge
Mwts attacked the president on
the ground that bis was a policy of
vacillation and weakness. "never
knowing whether the policy of to
lay will be the policy of tomorrok.'
In reply to the argument of the
democrats that the president had
kept the country out of war. the
xpe.uk r i-akl : "Hid announcements
have made It perfectly plain to the
people f the world, even to Mexico,
that his attitude is one f cringing
and shifting ami that there was no
longer danger in his thundering."
Republicans Ia'iuI StipMrt.
"The republicans as far as pos
sible, as patriots before partisans."
Judge Myers said, "sought t uphold
the president In his views, and had
refrained from criticism, until our
democratic friends apparently f the
belief that we were acquiescing in
the president's course with respect
to our foreign relation", are now
nfkiug the support of the country to
continue the failure. What policy
are we asked to approve? The na
tion has been humiliated, its citizens
slam upon the high sea.s. and n
land, and we have nothing but pro
test, and another letter written.
"Are w to approve and condone
this vacillating and blundering in
capacity simply because we have
not been plunged into war? Has
the administration taken a definite
stand n any policy? If it has . e
might he asked to approve it. a.c;
Americans, right or wrong, but w-
are confronted with the almost
daily chance of jittitmV not to say
policy, because there has been no
policy and yet we ire ajked to ap
pro this vacillating and blunder
ing." Judcp Myers touched upon the
foreign niation of this government
with the powers as war and said
that the president notes to Ger
many and othT countries, couched
in the highest rhetorical langninge,
are mere bravado and ar consid
ered by such by the countries to
whom they are addressed.
lUxalls lliicita I midgut.
In criticising the policy of the ad
ministration with regard to Mexico
th speaker said that "the president
demanded a salute of the ;l.ig by
Huerta. but it remains unsaluted to
thin hour." Jiuite Myers branded
ti"" trouble with the Huerta govern
ment in Mexico as a personal quar
rel between the president nni
liuerta. "The president put himself
and the nation in the ridiculous and
inconsistent attitude of declining to
recognize Huerta on the one hand,
and at the same time demanding
that the Mexican republic through
Hueria a.s its head, on the other
hand. shild apologize to the United
States by saluting Us Prig.'"
Judfe Mjers said further fn at
tacking the administration's Mexican
policy; "I'.efore and since the presi
dent's Indianapolis speech, mor
than 216 citizens of the United States
have been killed in Mexico anil on
the border. Mnie with nameles
atrocities. Was that our business?
Tho only pretense of squaring Ins
acts ith his wrds in the Mexican
affair, has beer, non-interference by
the president protect either the
lives or the property of American
citizens, even n American soil. The
order to take Villa dead or alive,
sounds very much like the order
to Huerta to solute the flag."

HAN ANTONIO, Texas. April .'.
(Jen. I-i nston is urging the Wash
ington government to secure from
the Uarramlstas free use of the Mex
ican railways for the American
troops attempting to capture Villa,
the worst enemy of the Garran.a
government now at large." It i.-s un
derstood that Fumioii has sent to
the war department warning that
huccess In the hunt that has now
extended more tha.i :5ott miles into
Mexico depends upon the use of the
railways foe re-v it titalling tlm Amer
ican troopers.
The rainy s-asor is about to set
in In Mexico and military operation;-1
during the latter part of the month
of April will be most dilhcult. This
will particularly affect the truck
service upon which the Pershing
expedition has to depend for its sup
plies. The trails in the region which
I the American troops have reached
are diflivult of passage for men and
horses and absolutely useless as far
as trucks are concerned.
The situation in Mexico is worse
than that in the Philippines, inas
much as it is important that the
capture or death of Villa be effected
at the earliest possible moment. As
long as American troops stay In
Mexico there is danger of complica
tions that the American government
has tried f(.r years to avoid. Puns
ton realiz's this and so do his su
periors at Washington.
Gen. I-'u nstrn anxiously awaited
today a further report from Gen.
Pershing on the conflict at Agua-s
Callentes. in which mnn than
Yilhstas ueie killed, but it Is prob
able there will be no further news
until Uol. lln " n gets in touch with
Pershing.

BERLIN, (via Sayville
wireless), April 5. That
Germany l?as made pcaco
overtures which were re
jected by the allies was ad
mitted in the Reichstag to
day by Dr. von Bethmann
Hollwcg, the imperial chan
cellor, in one of the most
important speeches deliver
ed since the war began.
"On Sept. 9 Germany
declared her readiness to
enter ' into peace negotia
tions, but then p.s now the
allies declined," said the
chancellor. "Let us sup
pose that J surfst to Pre
mier Arquilh of England,
that we sit down at a table
and examine the possibili
ties of peace and Mr. As
quith should begin with the
demand that Prusias mili
tary power shall be first
crushed. The conversation
would be ended before it
began. To that demand
there is only one answer
left a.nd that is the answer
of the sword. If our ad
versaries want to continue
this slaughter of human be
ings, want to continue the
devastation of Europe,
theirs is the guilt."
