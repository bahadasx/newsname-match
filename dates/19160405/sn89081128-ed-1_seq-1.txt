PLAN FOR PICNIC
GOES GLIMMERING
COMMERCIAL CLUB MEMBERS
DROP PLAN OF HOLDING
FARMERS DAY
DISCUSS ENLARGING CEMETERY
OR A CHANGE IN ITS
LOCATION
Monday evening's regular meeting of
the Commercial Club was given almost
exclusively to listening to reports from
various committees. This kept the
members present busy and in a happy
frame of mind for over an hour. Some
committees failed to report, notably
among which was the committee on a
municipal heating plant. There was a
good excuse for this committee not being
present however as they were having a
joint meeting with a sub-committee from
the council that same evening for the
purpose of arriving at some definite plan
of action.
Prof. Ackermann for the censorship
committee reported that Mayor Fritsche
had appointed Fred W. Johnson, Adolph
G. Meile and William Mather as a board
of censors. Later in the evening Mr.
Mather supplemented this report with a
statement from the board of censors to
the effect that it was the intention of the
board to have cards printed which
are to be placed in every business man's
office and which can be referred to when
ever any one comes along with a scheme
to get away with some of the merchant's
money. He asked for the hearty co
operation of every one interested in im
proving conditions in New Ulm. When
asked whether this applied to local people
also, he thought it would, but that the
board had not taken any definite stand
on that phase of the work.
For the White Way committee it was
reported that subscriptions are 3ing
secured quite rapidly and that the work
of getting enough money subscribed to
build the White Way on First North
and First South Streets is being pushed
with all possible dispatch.
There will be no community picnic nor
farmer's picnic as had been contemplated
because the committee appointed for that
purpose reported thru its Chairman Chas.
Stolz that the committee had looked
at the proposition from every angle and
saw no way of pulling off the stunt in a
manner which would prove satisfactory
to the farmers or business men. The
committee invited suggestions from those
present as to how such an affair could be
made a success, but no one ventured an
opinion and the project was quietly put
to sleep forever, unless at some future
meeting it be resurrected by some one
who has a plan that he is convinced will
be a winner and will commend itself to
the members of the Club.
At the request of Dr. Reineke, Pres.
Ottomeyer brought up the question of
enlarging the city cemetery. It was
stated that but very few desirable ceme
tery lots are to be had and that the
council should be importuned to buy
additional land at once. The subject
was opened for discussion, but only two
availed themselves of the opportunity
to speak. Capt. Steinhauser stated
that in his opinion the present city
cemetery is far from being a beauty spot
and that its location is such that it never
can be made to look like anything. He
advocated abandoning the present site
and finding a place that has natural
beauty. Otto Wichtel the tombstone
man, when asked his opinion, stated
that the present site on account of its
flatness could never be made beautiful.
No action was taken in this matter.
The matter of guide posts for the
County was brought up and was disposed
of by referring it to the Good Roads com
mittee. Every one present seemed to
favor better and more guide posts than
the County can boast at the present time.
By a resolution unanimously adopted
the by-laws of the Club were amended to
reduce the kind of members to two,
active members and honorary members.
Heretofore there were three classes, the
proprietary class which owned the
property of the club, associate members
and honorary members. The proprie
tary class by a document drawn up in
legal form surrendered their rights in
the property to the entire membership
and thereby eliminated themselves as a
special class.
Yes, there will be a banquet of the
Club this year, also. The entertainment
committee reported to that effect and
tentatively suggested Wednesday, April
26th, as the proper date to have the
banquet. There were no objections

FARMER'S TEAMS IN SMASH-UP.
A smashup occurred Monday noon
shortly before 1 o'clock on the corner of
Minnesota and Fifth South street, when
a team driven by Alois Brey of Cotton
wood was scared by the approach of an For Treasurer—
automobile, became unmanageable and
swerved to one side so that the side of
the wagon smashed into the rig driven
by George Polta, an employe of Schell's
brewery. One of the buggy wheels was
torn off and Polta was thrown to the
ground. He sustained a severe cut over
the left eye and was bleeding profusely
when taken to a local doctor's office.
It proved to be nothing serious, however,
and Polta will not be laid up.
SHREWDFARMHAND
OFF ON YACAWON
SOLD EMPLOYERS' PORKERS TO
REPLENISH SHORTAGE OF
LONG GREEN.
BOARDS TRAIN AND AUTHORI-
TIES FAIL TO FIND TRACE
OF HIM.
It is*not always coirect to say that a
farm hand is slow-witted or dense just
because he happens to be working out
in the country, as was conclusively
proven by one John Mills who has been
working on one of Ed. Berkner's farms
the vicinity of Cobden. Last week he
came to the conclusion that a vacation
trip would be just the thing for his health,
but as he was short of the necessary long
green he had about given up the idea,
when one of the porkers in the yard gave
a friendly grunt and solved the problem
for him. Sure thing, a few of these hogs
would be just the right size to give him
pocket money for the trip.
Last Saturday he put his plans into
execution. He took one of the teams,
hitched it to the wagon with the hog
rack and then helped himself to five of
the choicest porkers on the place. He
took them to Cobden and sold them to
Tom Peterson, a stock buyer. The pro
position looked better than ever to John
after that and after leaving the team in
one of the village barns he boarded the
afternoon passenger train for the east.
The residents of the peaceful village of
Cobden thought nothing of John's visit
or sale, because, according to Julius
Krause, there are more hogs in that
vicinity than in any other part of the
county, but towards evening Ed. Berk
ner got wind of the affair and he started
an investigation of the sale and inquiry
into what had become of his farm hand.
He found both rumors to be facts. The
hogs had been sold and the farm hand had
disappeared.
Sheriff Julius was at once notified and
he in turn sent out a description to the
surrounding towns, asking the police
authorities to arrest the* man and hold
him until an officer could be sent to bring
him back to New Ulm for a hearing.
The description of the man wanted
also is interesting. It reads something
like this: Red-faced Irishman, answers
to name of John Mills, stoop-shouldered,
no whiskers, three or four front teeth
missing, weighs 160 to 170 pounds, wore
cra\enette coat and gray suit, quite a
tobacco chewer and talkative when in
his cups.
According to the officers the hogs were
worth from $150 to $200, but it is not
believed that the stockbuyer paid Mills
anywhere near that amount.
Acquaintances of Mills say that he has
had the plan of getting out of the country
under consideration for some time, as
he has said on several occasions that he
intended to go to Canada and there
enlist in the British army. He was
short of money, however, and never
could carry out his plans until he struck
the hog lifting idea!
Prizetaker onions" may be sown now
to be transplanted to hotbeds or to the
open ground.

The court house is situated in the extreme
northwest corner of the ward and it is
thought that a more centrally located
place should be secured either on Broad
way or Minnesota street. One of the
suggestions was to locate the booths in
one of the saloons, as the latter are closed
on election days.

ie country is that
of a young man recently committed to
the hospital for the insane at St. Peter
from the Nicollet county probate court.
He went insane over the problem of
figuring out the date of his mother's
birthday.
The mother was born on Feb. 29,1836,
consequently would be eighty years old
this year, but the son claimed that her
birthday anniversary could not recur
on the 29th of February this year because
her second birthday anniversary had
fallen on March 1, her third on March
2 and so on, until this year there would
be a discrepancy of about two months
between the calendar and the way he
figured it out.
It is said that the young man was so
wrought up over the problem that he
sat up for several nights in succession
trying to bring a calendar of his own up
to date and he had almost succeeded in
making the figures look tangible, when
suddenly he was confronted by another
problem, which knocked all his figures
and calculations galley-west. He found
that the calendar did not add the extra
day to February in 1900, because ac
cording to the Gregorian calendar only
such centesimal years as are divisible by
400 can be regarded as leap years, and
have the extra day added to the second
month of the year.
When he struck this his mind apparent
ly snapped and he became irrational in
his actions towards his relatives and at
times so violent that he had to be
forcibly restrained from doing himself
and others bodily harm. When it was
seen that his condition was fast be
coming dangerous he was brought to
one of the local hospitals for treatment
and observation.
He was kept in the hospital several
days and when it was found that he did
not respond to the treatment and his
condition did not change for the better,
it was decided to take the unfortunate
young man to St. Peter before the judge .,,

fro.m

source in the past, such
is the belief of the members of the city
councu
who last Friday evening adopted
a new schedule of rates for motor users,
0 0 in 0
immediately.
The rates established by the council
several years ago were regarded as not
only obsolete, but also as inequitable,
both to the city and to the users of
electric current and the electric light
committee has had the problem under
consideration for several months. The
old rates fixed only a schedule of mini
mum charges for three sizes of motors,
75 cents for motors of from 1 to 5 horse
power $1.00 from 5 to 10, and $L50
minimum per month for all motors above
ten horsepower. In most cases the
users of the smaller motors were paying
more than the highest minimum rate
and in order to equalize these charges'
the following schedule of rates according
to the amount of current used as well as
a minimum charge for each horse power
was adopted by the council:
First 300 Kilowatts 5c per K. W.
Next 200 Kilowatts 4%c per K. W.
Next 200 Kilowatts 4c per K. W.
Next 500 Kilowatts 3%c per K. W.
Greater amounts 3c per K. "w.
Accordiuj^to the above schedule 4 user
of '300 kilowatts per month would be
charged at the rate of 4 l-2c per kilowatt
and would have to pay at that rate until
the current he uses amounts to 500
kilowatts or more, when he will come
under the 4 cent rate and so on until a
customer uses 1200 kilowatts when he
will pay at the lowest rate of 3 cents.
The council adopted another schedule
in reference to motor rates which prob
ably will increase the electric current
bills in a number of cases. A minimum
charge of 35 cents for each horsepower
per month was established and also a rule
adopted that no bill will be made out
for less than 75 cents, plus a charge of
10 cents per monht for meter rent. This
change in the schedule will affect such
motor users as run their machines only a
part of the year. There are said to be
several cases in the city where the motor
is only used during the summer season
and several who only use the current
during the winter. These will have to
pay at the rate of 35 cents for each
horsepower and those operating motors
of two horsepower or under will eome
under the minimum schedule of 85 cents.
It had been the intention of the council
also to readjust the schedule of water
rates, but the work of coming to a
decision on the motor rates had taken up
the better part of the evening and the
new rates probably will have to be taken
up by the incoming administration for
adjustment. As two of the members of
the water and lighting committee will
hold over at least another year it is be
lieved that these councillors will be re
tained on the committee and complete
their work soon after the organization
of the new council.
A committee from the Commercial
Club, consisting of Messrs. Somsen,
Crone and Vogel, appeared before the
council and requested that a committee
of the council be appointed to work in
conjunction with the Commercial Club
committee on the city heating plant
project. President Retzlaff appointed
Councillors Eibner, Krook and Hamann
to a sue
Yi committee. It is the in-
to work out a feas,b.e p.a„ to the estab-
lishment of the heating plant and as all
the facts have been gathered by them it
is believed that this can be presented to
the council in the immediate future,,
probably in the course of the present
month.
To persons knowing nothing about
the technicalities of electricity the kilo
watt hour basis for measuring electrical
current remains a profound mystery. It
The watt is a unit of measure for electricity,
as the quart is the unit of measure for
milk, and the bushel is a unit of measure
1,000, and a kilowatt is 1,000 watts
