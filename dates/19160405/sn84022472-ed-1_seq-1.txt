Department Orders
' ' More Motor Trucks
Washington, April 5 The war de
partment today "authorized purchase
of 108 more motor .trucks and two
gasoline tanks for ' the expedition.
These will be formed Into companies
of 27, cars each, maintaining the
greatly lengthened lines of communi
cation with General Pershing. A
despatch today -to the department indi
cates that General Pershing had gone
far south, toward the fighting center.
A despatch from General Funston
was as follows:
"Met Col. Dodd yesterday at Frovi-
dencia and-got details-of fight with
Villa bandits on March 29. His ex
pedition march with the Seventh cav
alry to reach Villa's camp and work,
done by that command deserves high
praise."
"General Funston sent no further de
tails today of the latest engagement
of the American, troops with a band
if Villa forces near Aguas Calientes.
The order for more motor trucks is
due to -a growing conviction that -the
Mexican railways may be of only -supplementary
service for, the present at
least, and that the Army will have' to
rely principally on' the overland motor
line from Columbus.
Meanwhile, however, the state de
partment is continuing its negotiations
with General Carranza to get use of
the railways.
The offer of the Aero Club of Amer
ica to sell two aeroplanes to the gov
ernment for one dollar each has been
declined. The new appropriation of
500,000 fbr more aeroplanes made its
acceptance unnecessary.
More, Troops Needed
For Pursuit of Villa
7
El Paso, Tex., April 5 The problem
of locating and capturing Villa some
where within an area of 1,600 square
miles," confronts Brig. General Per
shing today. . , ' .
Information from the front states
that . the American troops have been
disposed - to the best possible advan
tage but the task of running down the
Mexican bandit in an ever-widening
territory as me Drigand moves south-
ward into the Mexican interior, be-
comes increasingly difficult.
More troops are necessary, It is de-
clared. General Pershing has order
ed that detachments of infantry be
trained for mountain climbing and the
establishment of a sort of American
chasseur corps will be undertaken.
The. American commander antici
pates a long hunt and is preparing for
it. A Torreon, . despatch places Villa
at Maica, 90 miles southwest of
Guerrere. If this Is true, the bandit
probably is proceeding along the old
cbach road that . leads N into Santa
Rosalie, whence he could move on to
Parral, his reported objective.

a building lot. The building lot was
worth only $250. He declared Mrs.

The action of the state's at
torney's office Jias followed a
storm of complaints. ' Money of
hundreds of poor families,
many widows, not a few trust
funds for orphans, and thou
sands of dollars of sick benefit
funds have been dissipated,
practically wiped out, through
the crash of the depository.
Impelled by the repeated
charges .that the- law has been '
infringed upon-, the state's at
torney has hegun an inquiry.
wnicn aireaa.y- nas rteveloprj
newsensations in a-ease that
has stirred the courts of Fair
field : county as rarely in their
history. . '
One of the most startling facte de
veloped in the new inquiry was the
discovery that the records- of the
banking house access to which was
refused creditors by Herbert M.
.Knapp and his - associates have been
discovered hidden in 'a barn near
Trunbull.' Littered with stable v re
fuse, straw and - hay, and scattered
widely over the floor of the remote
little structure, they have been as
sembled with much care, and now are
stored in the- offices of Spotswood D.
Bowers, an attorney especially assign
ed by the state's attorney to conduct
the special inquiry.'
John C. Chamberlain, trustee underi
the bankruptcy proceedings, has been
directed by John W. Banks,, referee
in bankruptcy, to make a supplemen
tary report on the finances of the
concern, in the hope that hidden as
sets may be revealed, and that a divi-i
dend mav be made Dossible. '
u Herbert M. Knapp, who now is con-
aucting a realty office under the name
of the Title Guaranty & Trust Co.,will,
be summoned to-the witness stand,
and grilled as to the nature of certain
entries discovered , in these books,
many of them going back over a pe
riod of at least half a dozen years.V
A woman, 'employed . in clerical ca
pacity by the banking house; who has
been missing for some time, . will .be
brought into the new 'investigation.'
She is said to have the key'to certain ,
mysteries of the banking methods of
the defunct house. ,
The closest - scrutiny of all books
formerly possessed by the company.
iS' being made today - by expert ac
countants from New York, under the
direction of Spotswood D. Bowers,
detailed by Homer S. Cummings as a
special assistant, whose duty it will
be to report whether any criminal act
has been committed 'by officers of the
defunct banking institution or those
associated with him in collateral or
subsidiary companies.
An attempt to get the books from
officers of the Burr & Knapp Co. re
cently met., with (refusals to divulge
the hiding place or to turn them over
to the state's attorney's agent for ex
amination. Under an order issued
toy John W. Banks, referee in bank
ruptcy, before whom proceedings are
now, being conducted. John C. Cham
berlain, trustee, was compelled to turn
them over to the Investigators.
A truck-load of the 'books was haul
ed from the barn of George Chamber
lain, a farmer, living on Reservoir
avenue -and they are now closely
guarded in a room of the law offices
of Bowers, Williamson & Cornell . in",
the Citizens' building. 4
When found, some of the books and
papers were piled in boxes and others
strewn about the floor .midst straw,
hay and stable refuser Great diffi
culty was experienced in collecting the
papers, many of which were scattered
widely, partly covered by accumu
lations of debris.
It is freely admitted by the inves
tilgators that many of the transactions
"at least, appear to 'be shady" and
that under the bankruptcy acts, Her
bert M. Knapp, former president of
the Burr & Knapp banking firm, un
doubtedly will be put upon the wit
ness stand before Referee Banks that
he may explain certain entries, some
of them many years old.
