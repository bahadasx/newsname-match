the British note handed to the state
department.

excess war profits, incomes, sugar,
cocoa, coffee and motor cars, the chan

to raise about 65,000,000, which is
nearly double what many persons be
lieved he could raise by this means.
At the close of an able and lucid
speech in the house of commons to
day, explaining the greatest budget in

Alleged Price
Fixing of Meat
PACKERS 8C0RED BEFORE HOUSE
JUDICIARY SUB-COMMITTEE
BY FORMER CATTLEMEN
Jail Sentences Instead of Fines Urged
to Make Laws Prohibiting Restraint
of Trade in Foodstuffs More Strin
gent. Washington, April 4. A former
Kansas governor, W. R. Stubbs. and a
former Missouri judge. W. H. Wallace,
who said they had learned by raising
cattle themselves that meat packets
by .price fixing combinations were
crushing livestock growers, pleaded
with a house Judiciary sub-committee
today to aid in Inaugurating sweeping
reforms in the packing industry. They
appeared as counsel for western grow
ers and feeders. Speaking on the
Borland resolution now before the sub
committee, which would order a fed
eral trade commission inquiry lo de
termine whether the packers are vio
lating the anti-trust laws, they en
dorsed the proposal strongly and sug
gested making laws prohibiting the
restraint of trade in foodstuffs gen
erally more stringent. Jail sentences
instead of fines were particularly
urged.
Fines Are Not Effective.
"Fines are jokes," Mr. Stubbs de
clared. "They are not effective. The
producers and the consumers pay the
penalty. Anyone who juggles with the
prices of food when millions are Strug
gling for bread should be imprisoned
and not fined. Forty per cent, of the
feed lots in this country are empty
because of present market conditions.
Nearly every stockman that I know
believes there Is a packers' trust."
Packing Combination Denounced.
Mr. Wallace, who prosecuted the
James train robbers. heatedly de
nounced the alleged packing combina
tion.
"We are after a worse 0rrow;d now
tnan the James boys, he declared.
"These fellows steal more money in a
week than the James boys did in their
whole career.
Sought to Prove Combinations Existed
By affidavit and testimony ns to his
personal experiences te judge sought
to prove that combinations had existed
among packers in the Kansas City
yards within the last few yew. He
submitted an affidavit from Leo Hums,
a former stock yards employe, declar
ing that Kansas City ajld Chicago
packing houses were in constant com
municatio:i regarding proposed pur
chases fiom speculators. An affidavit
signed by Earl Cooper declared that
before the !-:J.kers came into posses
sion of the Kansas City yards he used
lo visit lli'i yard.s at night and supply
thorn with information as to the num
ber of lives: i'c!t on hand prior to the
opening of the market.
Recsived Cnly One Bid.
On one occasion, the judge asserted,
he received only one- bill on i bunc'i
of cattle at the Kansas City yards md
learned later that they were divided
between t'.vo packing concerns.
Arthur Meeker, vico pdesldent of
Armour and Company, promptly c,:ies-
tioned the accuracy of the judge's
statement re"ardinc one buyer for two
houses. Walter L. Fisher, attorney fu
the American National Livestock As
sociation, interjected the declaration
that he would be able to prove that
such a practice was not uncommon
Mr. Fisher produced a sales slip from
the Kansas . lty yards, which, he de
clyrcd, showed that one buyev had
purchased eighty-six cattle from
raiser a.id that Morris and Company
and the Cudahy Packing company had
divided them equally.
Enlivening Exchanges.
The session was enlivened by ex-
cnanges Detween Mr. Fisher and Mr.
Meeker over the proposal of the oack
ers to submit their books to the de
partment of agriculture to prove that
they are not making an unfiir profit
ana tne counter-proposal o fthe nro
ducers that a tribunal with subpoena
powers make the examination. Once
during the day Mr. Meeker declared
that he was willing to have an innui-
sitorial body with subpoena powers
conduct the examination but later he
insisted on his original proposal of
leaving the proposed investigation to
the department of agriculture.

Villa's Men Surprised.
Villa's men. according to their ver-
nlon of the encountor. appeared wh-dly
unsuspecting of the presence oi an en
emy a minute before they were ut
lackei.
It was r.bout noon when Colonel
r.rown trout-lit his cavalry within
eajy range. The Mexicans were lyln
about the p'ace, many of them ash-ep
unA II their horsea grazing In many
cases some distance from them. I

Interest at Funston's Headquarter.
The encounter aroused deep interest
at General Funs '.on s htadurters,
where additional details were awaiied
e.igcrly. but it vnan realized by oltioers
that the clTect or Colonel lsmwrn's lisht
and f other minor engagements mat
may occur la only lnd;rect. so far ai
the gr- ai.tr pro'.ili-m of catching Vill.i
i concerned. Knsagements of tiiat
character, it was said, may now be ex
pected from time to time and the run
ning down of the maraud ng bunds i
essential to the safety of the American
column, but it was indicated the only
effects co far ns Villa is concerned.1
will be to destroy the morale ot bid
supporting force.
Other Eands Operating.
There are known to be other hand.1
operating in that same part of Mexico
and a part of the American forces
must remain to deal witn tnem wn.ie
the other pushes on in the pursuit of
tne fugitive thu-f.
The action south of Bachlnava only
served to strengthen the opinion of
staT ofllcers that if the punitive expe
dition is to complete its work m-uiy
more troops muat be sent into the
road from Juarez to imnuauua ana
country or the Mexican Central Itail
cven through Chihuahua to points
farther south must be used.
Freer Use of Railroads Necessary.
The official admission at General
Funston's headquarters today that the
success of the expedition now depend
ed largely on the freer use of the rail
roads or the material strengthening or
the long roundabout line of communi
cation and its branches, revealej a it-
uaion that It wa believed might alter
the entire plan of pursuit.
Villa's Southward Shift Credited
Villa's latest southward shift was
credited In official quarters since it
came from consular reports in which
the outlaw was located well beyond
Chihuiua City and evidently trying
to reach I'arral or perhaps even, Tor
reon or Durango City. In the vicinity
of all those cities there are known to
be operating organized forces of
ilia's men aggregating a strength of
some thonusands. According to alt
late reports Villa appears to be travel
ling fast now and already has placed
between himself and the pursuing
Americans a considerable distance.
Quicker Means of Sending Troops.
To meet the new situation staff of
ficers assert a quicker means of send
ing forward troops and supplies should
be made and it was pointed out that
the direct Juarez-Chihuahua Itaiircad
offered that means or a large number
o ftroops most be sent to Columbus
Immediately for campaigning in Mexi
co. More Troops Required.
To reinforce the line of communi
cation now maintained would require
the calling of the few regiments left In
the United States other than those
engaged In border patrol duty or sta
tioned In the southern department.
None of the troops stationed along the
bordor should be used. In the opinion
of army ofllcers here, unless they are
replaced by -other military units. The
only remaining regiments that might
be called are the Second Cavalry and
the Third and Thirteenth Infantry.
Army men do not believe, however,
that the troops along the line of com
munication even if increased by these
three regiments, would be adequate to
guard the line it Its la extended from
