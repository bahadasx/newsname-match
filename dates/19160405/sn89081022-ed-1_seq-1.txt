FORMER SEN. GRUE
HAS PASSED AWAY
Prominent Citizen Answers Last
Summons at His Willmar
Home.
Hon. O. N. Grue, pioneer citizen and
an ex-senator of the county, passed
away at his home on East Litchfield
avenue last Saturday. The cause of
death was diabetes. For a year he had
experienced a gradual decline of
health and during the past two months
he failed very rapidly.
The Late Hon. O. N. Grue.
Nelson Grue was born April
1856, at Sheboygan, Wisconsin,
hence he failed a few days of attain
ing sixty years of age. In the fall
of the year of his birth the parents
moved to Carver county in this state,
where they lived for twelve years.
The father, Nils Olson Grue, enlisted
for the Civil war and served as a ser
geant in the Ninth Minnesota. In
1868 the family came to Monongalia
county and located north of Eagle
Lake in Dovre township. In 1881 Ole
N. Grue bought some land in Green
Lake township not far from the old
parental home, where he led the life
of a progressive farmer for thirty
years. In the fall of 1911 he moved
to Willmar and engaged in the monu
ment business. Mr. Grue was an ac
tive man in public affairs. He wasMinneapolis
one of the organizers of the Dovre &
Mamre insurance company in 1880,
became its first secretary and served
as such practically all the time he
lived on his farm. He held the posi
tions of chairman of supervisors, as
sessor and justice in his township for
several terms. He was clerk of hisplace,
school district for many years. In
1898 he was elected to represent the
county in the State Senate for four
years. He was the first treasurer of
th Bethesda Homes at Eagle Lake.
On Dec. 23, 1879, Mr. Grue was unit
ed in marriage with. Miss Anna Skat
aas. Seven children were born to
them, of whom two sons died in in
fancy. The deceased is mourned by
his wife and the following children:
Mrs. A. N. Olson, of Stanley, N. D.
John L. Grue, of Willmar Mrs. A. W.
Hanson, Peever, S. D. Mrs. L. S. Nel
son, Clearbrook, Minn. and Miss Al
ma Grue, who resides at home. There
are three grandchildren.
The funeral services were conduct
ed at the Lutheran Free church yes
terday afternoon. In .spite of the al
most impassible roads there was a
large attendance of old friends and
neighbors of the deceased from
Dovre and Green Lake townships, as
well as other parts of the county, and
the church was filled to its capacity.
Rev. Michaelson spoke in Norwegian
and English. The church choir sang
two selections, and Miss Lillie Nor
en sang a solo. A long line of friends
passed the bier to cast a last look
at the well known features of the de
parted. There were many beautiful
floral tributes testifying of love and
esteem. The pall bearers were Messrs.
William Hengstler, P. H. Frye, S. S.
Glarum, O. A. Jacobsoni, A. O. Bor
gan and Magnus Olson. The casket
was placed temporarily in the receiv
ing vault at Fairview, and the inter
ment will be made at the Long Lake
cemetery later.
Among those attending the funeral
from a distance were Mrs. Johanna
Nelson and Mrs. Charles Nelson ot
Hoffman Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Hanson
of Peever, S. D. Mrs. Alfred Olson
of Stanley, N. D. Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam NelSon of Spicer Mr. Hugh Mc
Manus and Miss Anna McManus ot
Spicer O. R. Sletten of Irving.
In the passing of Ex-Senator O. N.
Grue, his family loses a devoted hus
band and father, the community a
good neighbor and loyal friend, the
city one of its business men, the
county one of its honored citizens and
the State one of its Territorial pio
neers. A good man has passed from
our midst, whose memory will be re
vered and honored among those of
the pioneer founders of our local in
stitutions.
