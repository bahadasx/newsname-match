the Laporte road for about thirty vears,
died at about six o'clock Monday morn
ing from the effects of a shock ot paraly-
which he suffered Sunday morning
and from which he failed to rally. The
entire leftside of his body was helpless.
While Mr. Dyke has been infailing health
for some time, he had been able to be
about the buildings and had been feeling
fully as well ol late, until the time he was
stricken Sunday morning.
A particularly sad feature is the fact
that his daughter, Miss Carrie Dyke,
who had cared for her father during his
declining years, died at two o'clock in
the afternoon of the same day. Miss
Dyke had been ill only a week with pneu
monia and ber condition had been hope
ful until after the death of her father.
when she failed rapidly.
A double funeral was held today at
two o'clock from the home, Rev. W. T;
Best of the Methodist Episcopal church
officiating. Interment was in the La
porte cemetery, just across from the
borne. . The bearers were F. Z. SbioDv.
Louis Billings, Carlos Dyke and Albert
Bartlett.
Edwin H. Dyke was born in the west
part of town 86 years ago the 11th day
ot last February. He vas united in
marriage to Caroline Taylor, who died
three years ago next May. The daugh
ter, who was a lady highly esteemed in
the community, was born in Morristown
52 years ago last November and had
passed the most of her life with her par
ents, whom she had cared for tenderly
during their declining years. The lather
was an honest up-right citizen, always
industrious, and a man who had the re
spect and esteem of all who knew him.
They are survived by one son, Elmer
Dyke, of New Hampshire, who has been
here the past week, and bis two daugh
ters, who have made their home with
their grandfather and aunt for nearly
two years.

His Eighth Year
By reference to the Conference appoint
ments published elsewhere, it will be
seen that Rev. W. T, Best has been ap
pointed pastor of the Puffer M. E. church
at Morrisville for another year. This
will be his eighth year here and we un
derstand that such a record is not
equalled by any other church in the Ver
mont Conference. Other appointments
have been for se yen years, but never be
fore for eight years. This is evidence
that Rev. Mr. Best is held in high esteem
by his parish and the church over which
be presides. It ranks among the strong
est in the Conference, and is made up of
a body of live and active workers, which
includes several of the strongest business
men of Morrisville. We congratulate
this church on its prosperity and be
speak lor it and its pastor another year
of continued prosperity.
