PARIS, April 5.—French troops
have made further gains in trench
fighting in the Calllette woods, south
of Douaumont, the war office report-'

A squadron of French aeroplanes:
engaged in a great air raid on the
stations of Nantilloib and Damvillers.
Fourteen shells were dropped on
Nantiilols and five on the Damvillers
station. In fifteen other air engage-j
ments along the Verdun front, a Ger-j
man plane was brought down near
Naut Fourneaux and another near
Milly, and a third German aircraft
fell within its own lines.
Excepting the French gains south

General Funston and members of his
staff Exhibited a pronounced air of
pessimism. Funston himself frankly
admitted that a continuatldh of the
chase southward must be backed up
by a stronger force than at present Is
available.
Villa's escape from the Guerrero dis
trict was due to misinformation given
the American army officers by the
bandit's friends and sympathizers, ac
cording to start officers here.
Commenting on Colonel W. C.
Brown's defeat of a Villista force thir
ty miles north of Guerrero, April 1,
Funston pointed out that the troops
under General Pershing available for
pursuit are undoubtedly now far south
of the scene of the second engage
ment, which resulted in the killing of
thirty Villistaa.
There wert no casualties among the
two hundred negro troopers in Colonel
Brown's Tenth cavalry command.
Knowledge of the fight is limited to
reports brought to General Pershing
by Mexican ranchers. No detailed offi
cial report has yet been made.
General Funston believes the ban
dits who burned two bridges north of
Monclova yesterday are Villistas, but
is not certain, and admits himself
somewhat at sea concerning the lead
ership of this new enemy faction.
There have becm no reports to head
quarters of disaffections among Car

Villa sympathies.
Plotters at Work.
IDL PASO, Texits, April 5.—Twenty

Villa, Tiaz and Orowo followers to
capture Juarez from the Carranza
garrison.
Carranza Consul Garcia stated that
three of the fifty men arrested in
Juarez have confessed that the plot

day while the garrison attended a
band concert in the plaza without
their weapons.
The public execution of several of
the alleged conspirators set for to

protested against its baroarism.
Knowledge of the plot caused the
recent Carranza mobilization in Chi

the conspirators escaped to the United
States and their extradition has been
requested.
