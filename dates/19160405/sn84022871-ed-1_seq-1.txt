John W. Murkland.
It is with extreme regret that we
report the death of one who for years
has been one of the landmarks of
the village of Barton. John W. Murk
land died at his home on the corner of
Church and Elm streets, Friday evening,
March 31, of cancer, having been a
great sufferer and confined to the bed
about a year. The deceased was of
Scotch parentage, being the son of
William and Margaret Barr Murkland.
He was born June 22, 1840. on the sea,
as his parents were immigrating to
America. The vessel which brought
them was sailing- under the united
States flag, therefore Mr. Murkland
was born an American.
His early life was passed in Lowell,
Mass. Having a decided aptitude for
mechanics he studied pattern and model
making with marked success. He was
for some time connected with the
Lowell Manufacturing Carpet Works,
and together with his father, invented,
built and jointly patented the Murk
land carpet loom, which was widely
used both in this country and abroad.
Mr. Murkland came to Barton in 1875
and in 1876 built the machine shop
located on Water street, where he
conducted a general jobbing business
and made wood-working machinery. In
1879 a foundry was added to the plant
and the manufacture of plows and
plow repairs commenced. Mr. Murk
land was the first to introduce the
long clevis plow, which is now exten
sively used throughout New England
Soon afterwards he engaeed in the
manufacture of wood furnaces snd cast
iron sugar srchss, being the first
rntn afacturer to place an iron arch
upon the market in Vermont. In the
eail nineties the present foundry
building was erected. For several
years especial attention has been given
to the manufacture of bobbin and
spool machinery and the factory turns
out a complete line of these machines,

effect that the Freshmen are going to

Attention ! Do not forget the base

price of admission will be within the
means of all. Come on t and support
your academy team. This means you !
The seniors held a class meeting last
week and chose the following class
motto, "Simplicity, Sincerity and Ser
vice." If the members of the senior
clss3 only live up to that motto they
will render to the world a large ser
vice. If everybody took that motto as
one of the cornerstones of their lives,
how much better this old world of ours
would be !
Mr. Bates wishes to announce that
he has his spring housecleaning done
at least, as far as the office is con

much more room and more light in the
office, while incidentally it also caused
many cobwebs to be removed.
The school has had a large number of

THOUGHTS ON EVIL.
Evil events from evil causes
spring. Aristophanes.
He who does evil that good
may come p&ys a toll to the dev
il to, let him into heaven. J. O.
Hare.
The more common method of
getting rid of an evil is to merge
it in a greater. Thus, if one suf
fers a loss of half his fortune
at play, he overcomes his morti
fication by losing the other half.
The most ingenious expedient
of this kind was that of the in
digent gentleman of rank who
married his' washerwoman to
get rid of her bill against him.
