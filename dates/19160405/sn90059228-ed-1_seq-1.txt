CHAUTAUQUA WEEK
TO 8E A WINNER
Attractions for 1916 Chautauqua to
be Held at Warren, Aug. 3 to
7, Have Been Booked.
Mr H. A Hedges, field manager
fci the Vawter Chautauqua System,
made us a call yesterday, and while
hei told of the attractions that have
been booked for the Warren summer
Chautauqua assembly, Aug. 3 to 7
inclusive. He assures us that the
reputation of the Vawter System
will be fully maintained and that the
pioposed program is a winner.
cal, literarv and make-up skits and
fancies The Savranoffs are musical
Hussians, who display great versatili
ty and present some novel and in
teresting instruments, including the
Balalaika.
The last clay comes the Christine

There will be five musical organi-1 sion that a young man has carried

be \aried in character and are de
signed to meet the requirements of
the people at all grades of musical

The Christine Giles Company and
Mr. Ralph Bingham will furnish
music and fun for one day The
Bohannans and The SaManoffs com

A Big Band.
The Militai^ Conceit Band is
brought in response to strong demand
for big band music It is said to be
by far the people's favonte. The
Old Home Singeis, as one might sup
pose, will sing the songs of heart
and home, songs that are held dear
in the memoiies of all. Their splen

together by a cleverly designed
sketch that adds wonderfully to the
effect.

Celebrated Orators.
Yutaka Minakuchi, a celebrated
Japanese scholar and orator, will de
liver an address. This is the same
Japanese who so distinguished him
self as an orator in the "Men and
Religion Forward Movement" and
other speaking tours. Hon B. F.
TVTcDonald, of Ohio Stewart I. Long,
tind J. Fred Clarke, all standard
Chautauqua orators, are also booked
to appear. Rev. J. L. Gordon of
Winnipeg, a renowned pulpit orator
will lecture on the subject: "Grit,
Grace and Greenbacks."
As a big entertainment feature we
are to have Ducrot, the magician.
Mr. Hedges places Ducrot in the
front rank as an exponent of modern
magic and says that his tricks are
both mystifying and interesting, the
delight of the children and of grown
ups as well.
A children's specialist will have
charge of the juvenile work fore
noons and this will be given special
attention in an effort to surpass all
similar efforts among the children in
the past.
Mr. Hedges says the program is a
sure winner as time will reveal

Flood Danger Averted.
The present cool weather has re
tarded the melting of the deep snow
all over the valley and has thereby
prevented a serious flood. High
water is reported along Red River at
Fargo and Moorhead and at Grand
Forks, and if the cool weather had
not interfered Red River as well as
all other streams in this county
would have been over their banks by
this time. Much water has already
run off, but considerable snow yet
remains on the ground. It will be at
least a week or perhaps ten days
before any seeding can be done in
this locality. One consolation is that
the plowing is all done and it will*
not take long to put the seed in the
ground, when the spring work does
commence
Plant Scotch Fife or Marquis Wheat
John Anderson, from town of Com
.stock, was in town last Thursday, to
see his daughter, Mrs. Anton Bur
seth, of Stephen, who is receiving
medical treatment at the Warren
hospital. Mr. Anderson is a practi
cal farmer and in commenting on
the lateness of the season he stated
that in his experience blue stem
wheat did not turn out as well as
Scotch Fife when the seeding is late.
We don't know whether that is the
experience of other farmers, but we
thought it well to publish Mr. Ander
son's observation, as it may be of
-^alue this year.

Public schools are spending their

Edwin Johrson ranks first in
scholarship in the class of 1916
Margaiet Dundas has second ranking
with Freda Ekblad, Byron Lundquist
and Minnie Parr nearly equalling her
for second place.
This is the second year in succes
off first honors and in both cases
they are young men of high ideals
and good habits.
Frans Larson of last year's class
is row making good at the Univer
sity. Edwin is looking forward to a
hard summer's work to help him earn
funds with which to begin his course
next September.
"School Education", the leading
journal of Minnesota, has in its April
issue an extensive article on, "Boys
and Girls Club Work" as conducted
b\ the Warren Associated Schools.
A pictuie of Oscar Larson and a
sample of his prize winning potatoes
is also shown therein.
We would like to call the attention
of fathers- and mothers of Warren to
the fact that the laws of Minnesota
forbid any pupil under twentv-one
vears of age, to loaf in or play pool,
billiards or to bowl in any public
plac^ used for such purposes. The
the classiest and cleverest of musi- owners of such places have no legal
right to allow any one under 18
years of age and any pupil under 21
years of age to loiter therein.
I speak of this because there has
apparently been no effort made to
see that this law is enforced in ref
erence to the bowling alley in War
ren.
Some of our pupils are failing in
their work in the puplic schools be
cause they have been spending too
much tinip in such places.
Not only are such pupils losing
time that that should be used for
school work, but they are spending
money that ought to be spent in
other ways.
Every teacher knows that as a
lule the pupils who loiter around
places curtained from public view
take home the noorest report card
for their parents to sign each month.
What a child is doing from the
time school is dismissed at 4:00 P.
M. until school is called at 9:00 A.
M., determines very largelv what
that child is able to accomplish while
under the teacher's supervision.
We all know that those who are
allowed to loaf around the streets or
other loafing places until late at
night, are not in condition for school
work the next day.
Please remember if your son's or
your daughter's report card has any
grade on it below 90 per cent, that
boy or girl should attend to the mat
ter of raising such a grade.
It costs a great deal to keep up
the public schools. Those who are
spending money to keep them up to
a high standard, should get value re
received for the money spent. They
will do* so when all the influences
acting upon the child outside the
school room, promote rather than
hinder the work done within the
school room.
In other words, the school alone is
but partially responsible for the ed
ucation of the children.
Every parent is responsible, every
official is responsible, yes, we are all
responsible and we must all work to
gether if the best results are to'be
echieved.
Every child should be encouraged
to start a bank account, however
small. The child should be encour
aged to use some of the pennies and
dimes to make that account grow.
They should be taught to save for
some purpose and probably there is
no better one than that of procur
ing a better education after complet
ing the work of the public schools.
Please remember that this has
not been written by one who desires
to meddle in other peoples affairs or
to criticise any legitimate business.
However, it is the duty of every
teacher to stand unalterably in op
position to all that hinders the best
and highest development of the chik^f
ren under his care. A
Very respectfully,
E. M. MITCHELL.
It Happens in the Best of Families.
Last week the Sheaf made an
error in the Warren Pharmacy ad

by Mr. Quistgard is of full 40 per
cent strength, but through some un
accountable error the printers made

RED RIVER VALLEY
CONFERENCE MEETS.
Report of Meeting Held at Fergus
Falls, Minn.
The Red River Valley Conference
of the Swedish Lutheran Augustana
Synod which recently convened in
Fergus Falls, was a large and im
partant gathering of church people.
All the old officers were re-elected,
being as follows: Rev. S. W. Swen
son, Evansville, president Rev
James Moody, of Fergus Falls, vice
president Rev. J. M. Persenius, East
Grand Forks, secretary and Aug.

On Friday afternoon, March 24, a
jubilee festival was held at the
Northwestern College to commemor
ate the 15th anniversary of the
founding of the school and rejoice
over the fact that the institution had
succeeded in raising the necessary
amount, about $21,000, to pay all its
indebtedness. Toward this amount
Hon. James J. Hill had contributed
$2,500 A splendid program was
rendered on this occasion, the princi
pal address being by Dr. O. J. John
son, President of Gustavus Adolphus
College. Prof. E. Sjostrand, of
North Star College, at Warren,
brought greetings from that institu
tion, mentioning the fact that at this
time congratulations and rejoicings
were mutual, as North Star College
had also succeeded in raising the
amount necessary to pay its debts.
Rev. James Moody, who is the found'
er of Northwestern College and who
has stood nobly and steadfastly by
the institution, either as teacher,
president, or president of the Board
of Directors, during all the struggl
ing ears of its existence, has per
formed a work that only a few can
leahze the magnitude or importance
of at this time.
In spite of a few pessimists and
knockers, both North Star College
and Northwestern College are gain
ing friends and supporters among
both ministers and laymen and the
usual assistance was voted for both
schools.
A resolution of thanks was voted
Hon. J. J. Hill for his liberal dona
tions to the educational work of the
conference.
Tf decided to erect an old peo,
ples home at Alexandria during the
year at a cost not to exceed $25,000.
The Ladies Home and Foreign Mis
sion society also had their meeting
in connection with the conference.
Officers, elected for the ensuing year
are as follows: Mrs. S. W. Swenson,
Evansville, president Mrs. James
Moody, Fergus Falls, vice president.
Mrs. J. M. Persenius, East Grand
Forks, secretary Mrs. A. A. Westeen,
Grand Forks, corresponding secre
tary Miss Ida Anderson, Warren,
historian and Mrs. A. B. Anderson,
Evansville, treasurer.
WARREN POST OFFICE
RECEIPTS GROWING.
Postmaster C. A. Tullar reports
that the receipts of the Warren, post
office for the past year at the close of
the quarter ending March 31, total
$9,200, the largest since the office
was established. This is good evi
dence of growth in the community.
The county court house, the public
scho&ls and North Star College help
greatly to swell the revenues of the
office.
Walter Miller and Miss Esther
Stark, two popular and highly es
teemed young people of Angus were
married at Crookston on March 23,
by Rev. Oten, of the M. E. church.
The parents of the bride and groom
are among the most prominent fam
ilies of Angus. A host of friends ex
tend congratulations to the happy
young couple.

TABOR TOWNSHIP
WINS $200 PRIZE.
Money Will be Used for Road

PROHIBITION NATIONAL
CONVENTION IN ST. PAUL.
Th* National Convention of the
Piohibition Party, to be held in St.
Paul July 18-21, will probably be the
largest convention of the kind ever
held. In addition to the regular con
vention business of making a plat
form, nominating candidates for
president and vice president, and
forming a new National Committee,
them will be a great "dry" parade
participated by drys from all over
the United States. Many Minnesota
counties aie arranging displays and
floats for this event. It is expected
that no less than a thousand auto
mobile parties, from various sections
of the country, will come to the con
vention. The program will contain
the names of the most notable pro
hibition speakers in the United
States. This convention meets only
once each four yeais, and when it
does meet it marks a notable event
in the history of the prohibtion
movement. It has never been held
west of Chicago, and since its first
gathering in 1869 most of the meet
ings have been in the east. The 1912
convention was held in Atlantic City,
N. About 1,000 regular delegates,
in addition to alternates and visitors
will be in attendance, and it is ex
pected that the total attendance at
the gathering may reach 10,000.
MEETINGS IN UNITED
"LUTHERAN CHURCH.
Interesting and well attended de
votional meetings are held this week
in the United Lutheran church by
pastors from neighboring congrega
tions. The meetings began on Mon
day evening and will close to-night
with an English sermon by Rev.
Levi Roseland, of Crookston. The
ministers who are here are: Rev.
Hoagland, of Oslo Rev. Stavaas, of
Thief River Falls. Rev. Lutnes, of
Neilsville, Rev. Roseland, of Crook
ston and the local pastor, Rev
Knudtsen.
Can't Fill Twine Orders.
The Minnesota state prison could
sell more twine that it now manu
factures, according to the statement
of Frank Whittier, parole agent.
The prison twine plant will make
23,000,000 pounds this year. This
already has been sold. The Russian
goverrment a short time ago sent in
an order for 4,000,000 pounds, but it
could not be filled.
"Cut it out."
Every farmer in the county should
turn to the local page and read care
fully the Warren Pharmacy ad on
formaldehyde this week. Cut out
the ad and post is up in the granary
or place where you can find it
when you want it. All seed grain
should be treated with formaldehyde
before planting to prevent smut and
other riseases.

N. P. Johnson, the man who origi

has again come to the front with an
invention which promises to be a
boon to farmers. He has invented
and patented a new make of drag
which he guarantees will entirely
eradicate quack gress as well as be
ing sub soil drag, bringing up new
ground and turning the old soil un
der. He has had one built according
to his specifications by a local shop
and as soon as the weather is favor
able will give it a trial near the
city. The drag is triangular in shape
and is drawn by four horses.

ery concerns are negotiating with Mr.
Jchnson for his patent, one Racine
firm having offered him $45,000 for
the patent rights.Crookston Press.

ARBOR DAY
PROCLAMATION
Governor Burnquist Wisely Defers
Annual Tree Planting Until
April 28.
The season of the year has again
arrived when every home in Minne
sota can be beautified by the plant
ing of trees, shrubbery and flowers,
and when in our schools special
study of arboreal life should be en
couraged by fitting exercises and all
of our citizens by proper activity be
made to idealize more fully the prac
tical and aesthetic value of plant
culture and tree life.
It is remarkable what a difference
the manifestation of even a little
community interest in the promotion
of arboiiculture makes in the ap
peal ance of the grounds of our
schools and public building and of
our farms and municipalities. An
illustration of the combination of
berutv and utility is the present day
piact'ce on the part of many em
ployers of labor of making surround
ings of those working for them
pleasant by having contiguous to
their factories and shops grassv
plots and lawns on which have been
nlantpd shade trees, vines and
flowers This custom cannot be too
highly commended, and with very
little expense and work could be
adopted by a much larger number in
our different communities and in all
walks of life, whereby many places
that are now eyesores would be
transformed into spots of health and
beaut}
Closely associated with the care
and growth of trees and plants is
the protection of bird life. The
hostility and indifference of man
kind to the feathered creatures of
the woods should be eliminated and
nll possible efforts advanced to save
from extermination these friends
and companions of man, who not
only gladden him with their charm
and the melodies thev pour forth,
but who are of practical value in
destroying- many of the enemies of
trees and crops.
In order to set apart a certain day
for the observing of which, wherever
convenient, appropriate ceremonies
may be held. I, J. A. A. Burnquist,
Governor of tjie State of Minnesota,
do hereby designate and proclaim
Fridav April 28, 1916, to be Arbor
and Bird day.
Witness my hand and the Great
Sea) of the State of Minnesota affix

short horn cattle and pure bred hors
es to take back with him to Montana.
The fact that farmers in the im
mediate vicinity of Warren are now
able to furnish buyers from a dis
tance with almost everything that is
wanted in the line of pedigreed
stock, is evidence of the great de
velopment made in stock rasing here
during the past ten years. In
Montana, on the other hand, Mr
Nemetz says,, the cattle ranges are
being broken up and grain farming
introduced.

Have received inquiries from all over
the county."
