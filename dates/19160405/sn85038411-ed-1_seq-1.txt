FIRST FOUR GRADES TO

sand Cases Reported Dur
ing March Is Cause of
Strenuous Efforts by Au
thorities
Following a conference with nied-1
leal inspectors of the Harrisburg pub-1
lie schools. Dr. J. M. J. Raunick, city
health officer, this afternoon ordered!
ill rooms in the First, Second, Third |
rnd Fourth grades in the public, pri-!
i ate and parochial schools in the city!
closed from to-morrow morning for
the remainder of ihe week in on ef
fort to check the epidemic of measles.
At the same time letters were senl
all clergymen in the city notifying
them to have all children under 15
years barred from Sunday school ses
sions this coming Sunday and Sunday,
April 16.
Orders were also issued to the man
agement of all theaters and moving
picture houses in the city to bar all;
children under sixteen years from at
tending any exhibitions.
Schools Ke-Opcn Monday
In issuing the orders to close the'
lower grades in the schools Dr.
Raunick explained that the schools j
will be closed for the remainder of!
ibis week but that will reopen next
Monday for a period of one week. On ;
the following Monday, or April 17. the :
schools will again be closed for a,
period of another week.
Explaining this plan. Dr. Raunick
said that children exposed to con-j
tagion during the first period in which
the schools were open would develop 1
the measles during the time the!
schools were closed and would not
therefore threaten children who at
tend the sessions, following. A similar]
plan has been successfully worked out
in fighting measle epidemics in other \
cities, he declared.
The present epidemic resulted in
1,017 cases during the month just
closed and is now spreading at the
rat" of thirty cases a day.
These strenuous measures on the
part of the health authorities will be j
successful in checking the contagion,
it is believed.
Lack of Prize Will Not
Defer Wanamaker Flight
Special to the Telegraph
New York, April s.—ln reply to
the cablegram sent by the Aero Club!
of America, to Lord Northeliffe, in-!
quiring whether his ante- bellum offer
of a prize of $50,000 for the first trans-!
Atlantic fight was still open, the club •
yesterday received this answer:
"Yes, after the war."
The reply, however, Allan R. Haw- ,
ley, president of the club, said will;
not affect the recently announced
plans of Rodman Wanamaker to make
a cross-Atlantic flight in a new high
powered triplane now tinder construc
tion, as Mr. Wanamaker had not con
sidered the matter of a prize. The'
flight probably will he attempted this
summer, and the war, Hawley
thought would not interfere.

Neutral Just From Country!
Says They Are Hostile to Both j

COMPLETELY MOBILIZED
Action Was So Unexpected
That Public Was as Much As
tonished as Rest of World
By Associated Press
London. April 4 (delayed).—"Hol
land bared its teeth to the belligerents
on both sides so unexpectedly that the
Dutch public was as much astonished
as the remainder of the world," said
a prominnt neutral just returned from
Amsterdam to the Associated Press
to-day. This person, who enjoys ex
ceptional opportunities of obtaining
reliable information, stated that not
only was the Dutch army mobilized,
but actual maneuvers were held as if
to repel forces landing from the North
Sea in the neighborhood of Flushing.
The mobilization was accomplished
swiftly. \ Irtualty every private motor
car in the country was seized. While
mobilization took place along the Ger
man frontier, maneuvers were held
only along the seacoast. To add to the
excitement, the Germans massed men
and guns along the Belgo-Dutch fron
tier near Antwerp as if in preparation
to repel an invasion from that direc
tion.
Against All Belligerents
The returned neutral is convinced
the demonstration was aimed against
Germany as much as England. He
stated irritation in Holland against all
belligerents bad become so pronounced
that there was a sullen feeling of hos
tllfy toward both Germany and Great.
Britain which was becoming general
throughout HIP country. On account
of the British blockade. Holland is ex
periencing shortage of food to such an
extent thai ihe American Commission
for Relief of Belgium lias been asked

tain districts. The Dutch government

transported to Holland in vessels com
mandeered by it without reference to
any limitation fixed by agreement with
