DRUG STORES
SINCIi the first of the year, 6S new dru£
stores have sprung up in King county,
according to county officials. A good many
of these have been established in the city.
ALL these new drug stores cannot be sup
ported legitimately. No man can conscien
tiously or in reason believe that all ot them
are on the square.
There is no use beating about the bush.
Great quantities of liquor are being sold—
and some of the old drug stores as well as
some of the new ones are making a farce of
the prohibition law.
Drunkenness in Seattle is becoming al
most as common as it was before the state
went dry.
The people of this state voted for the pro
hibition law. It is not the square thing to
v wink at this open violation of the law. It
is un-American and unprincipled. It is detri
mental to public peace and to private busi
ness. It serves to keep up an agitation over
the "booze" question that should be, by this
time, definitely and forevermore settled.
Seattle and the state have more important
and larger affairs to deal with. They can
not afford to be eternally bothered with a
saloon question.
OUR PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE
WORK TO DO.

"The great trouble with this form

mCOME TAX TO
FURNISH FUNIS
WASHINGTON', April s.—'"Let the rich pay for it!"
This was the answer of Rep. ( laude Kitchin of North
Carolina, majority leader of the house of representatives,
when 1 asked him how congress proposes to raise the money
to pay for the preparedness program.
Mr. Kitchin went on. "About one hundred million dol
lars a year can be easily added to the income-tax receipt#
without lowering the exemption limit. Perhaps we can work
out an inheritance tax, too.
"We are working on that now. I am in favor of that.
"Then we have got a bill to tax war munitions profits.
1 think that these three will pretty nearly furni«h alt the
money that may be needed. In fact, I think we can then
take off some of thc-o puttering stamp taxe-> that we are
now fussing around with; the more objectionable ones that
arc just a nuisance and don't bring much money in."
Revenue Bills May Come Up This Month
"Why," I asked, "ha* congress been so slow in pre
paring it* revenue bills?"
"Waiting for these army and navy bills," replied Kitchin.
"No need to hurry about the budget until we find out how
much motiey .we are going to need. When the committw*
get thru figuring out now much the big navy and big aftny*" *
are going to cost, then we can intelligently begin to find out
where the money is to come from. I think we will have
our income-tax bill ready this month and possibly the in*
heritance tax and the other bills."
"What is your idea as to how to get more from the
income tax?" I a»ked.
"By sharp increases of the rate* on the higher incomes,**
Mr. Kitchin replied promptly. "Besides, some of the brackets
can be brought closer together—the jumps between the sires
of the big incomes are too big; we can grade them up a
little between twenty, twenty-five, thirty, forty and fifty
thousand dollars a year, and so on. increasing the rate on

"Just the well-known, obvious things that are known as

"You would not include Missouri mules?"
"By no means," answered Mr. Kitchin.
"Nor cartridge clips made by a can company?"
"I don't know." he answered. "Perhaps things like that
would come in. That would have to be worked out by our
experts in studying: this kind of legislation. They are study

"Will you have the support of the majority of the house
