SHOOLHE CULLED
For Betterment of Roads in This
County 1,200 Miles of Pub
lie Highway in Breckinridge.
GOOD ROADS VS. BAD ROADS.
Hardlnsburg, Ky., April 1 A your
County Attorney, I feel It my duty to
say a few words to the citizens and tax
payers of Breckenrldge county on the
road question, as so much is being writ
ten and discussed as to the remedy ft r
our "bad roads.
Tons of literature Is being distributed
by the United States Government and
by the several States on this question
and how to build public highways.
After r.eadlng carefully all plans sug
gested, good, b.id aid Indifferent, and
the dillerept laws in the several States,
and the procedure in the various coun
ties under the laws applicable to each
State and county, and the many ss
terns of working our public roads put in
operation by our Fiscal Courts, the
whole matter bolls clown tovine simple
question and proposition: "Where is
the money to come from to construct
good roads under either of the plans
suggested in all this literaturt?'' Every
citizen should be interested in the roads
of his county. Some are, many others
are not. The majority are "kicker,"
and do nothing to aid or advance the
r cause, either physically or financiuilv.
They simply "Yell Bad Roads," and
the cause is, graft by county officials,
and that the tax money is not spent as
it should be, or only part is spent on the
roads. These are facts that any citizen
who cares to listen, h:ars most evrry
day.
Is this true? No. We have approxi
mately 1,'JOO miles of public hlghwajs
in Ureckenridge county, and about
$3,000 (eight thousand dollar) from
road taxes to expend each year in the
repair and upkeep of said roads. Any
"business man will readily see that to
have good roads, or even passable roads
for any distance in 'this county, it is an
impossibility. For about thirty years
we have been going along !n this same
old channel, with approximately the
same sum each year, combined with
the free labor, which under the different
systems of road working during these
years, amounted to about the same
thing. We have had in these years men
from different walks of life composing
our Fiscal and County Courts, and the
roads worked under many plans. "The
money and labor is all gone and today
the roads are in the same condition."
Is it not time to chanse the system?

Attends Her Old Church.
Mrs. Joe 1'itch made her regular
visit to Walnut (irove church, L,odi
hurt;, last Sunday to attend church
meeting. She na uover missea a meft
Int' at her old home church since she
moved away from it, except when she
w.is prevented by sickness.
What is the remedy? I, in all earnest
ness say to you, stop now, Rive this
question some thought and change the
system. The tax-payers can chanse
the systerr by their vote at an election
c illing for a bond issue.
That is the only remedy for money to
build roads in this county, or any other
county, where the tax is not sufficient
eich ear to repair the old washed out
roads much less construct good roads.
Under the present condition, we have
not enough money to repair and keep in
condition our old dirt roads.
If any citizen doubts me, I respect
fully ask him to call on our County En

Dead Chickens For Easter.
There cannot be anything more at
variance with the spirit of what it Is
meant to symbolize or celebrate than
the little, real, dead and stufftd,
downy chickens put lu the collections
