Partkipanta' account of the light between American and Villiata force*
at "iuerrero can now for the tirst time bo given. In Thr Tribune car. ln
whieh for a week I have been aeexonpaaying General Perahing through
the heart of Villa's domain. I drove here this afternoon from his camp
t.) greet Colonel George A. r>odd anrl his detachment of the 7th Cavalry.
I was the tirst American not in the army to see his victorious force.
Motor truekl tilled the ranch yard between the ruined adobe build
ings and the pofld under the willows where Doddfa troopa were camped
\ and tired mountl were grazing. They had just brought rations to the
animall and dust-grimed, hairy men. The feat of li-IHBM and men. this
(time living off the country-ohiefly upon b<-ef am! beans. never with
bread or eoffee -Impreesed the aoldien as they elaatered about me, far
nn.-.' than the reniarkable dash and eunning of their running fight.
(olonel Dodd PraaBBB Men.
??The fight itaelf was child's play, a lark." laid the colonel, as v.e
rtood over an old adobe oven. "But what stands out in my mind is thi
j spirit and endurano- of my men and horses. It only BJOC1 to prove that
I almoat any effort ia within the power of our mounted troops when hard
put to it. The fight was rather an ar.ti-climax to our 426 miles of travel
in the fourHren davs whieh just preeeded it. whieh ll a record. I think.
. particularly eonsidering our scant rations. for cavalry action. Although
in this we had loflt comparatively few horses. had we tried to aave them
we would have been late and mis.sed the encountor. On the otner hand,
had they been fresher, not a man of the bandit's force would have escapea
Other officers about us agreed that. had the river below Gucrrer ,
been croaaed ftfteen minutea eariier, not a man of Villa's command would
be alive to*-day. ,
"ParticuUr credit, too, ia due to the courage and effcieney of my
men." said the colonel. "Most of them wew green troops. Almost M
I per cent of them had never before faced fire."
The ftfty-five-mile march Bcroaa the Sierra Madre from Bachma,.a,

by the (arranza foree under (Colonel

Santo Domingo, the Villistas fled
.-uuthward. leaving th< ir leader,
Manue! IWa, and a number of
others dead on the tield. Cano's
troopers nhandoned pursuit early.
News of the approarh of the Vil?
listas was conveycd lo ('olonel

of the 10th Cavalry, stationed at
San Antonio. Rushing his men
north ward at terrifk pare, ('olonel
Brown's forre encountered the ban?
dits ahout noon at Aguas (alientes,
twenty miles southeast of Baehinaba
and thirty miles north of Guerrero.
Evidently deeming themselves safe
from further pursuit, the Villistas
arare restir.g their horses. Many of
the bandits were enjoying a siesta.
The bandits searoely had time to
reax-h their horsi-s hefore the negro
eavalrymen were upon them. Then
ensued a running fight, in which
Andrew Martin J.opez, Villa !icu
tenant in rommand, led his uratter
ing band in wild flight southward,
through San Antonio and beyond.
The ootlawa hurled away guns and
rartridge belts in their flight.
Aeoording to the ranchmen,

is placing great hopes now on thia
branch of the pursuit, espeavially as
further service at the front by aero
