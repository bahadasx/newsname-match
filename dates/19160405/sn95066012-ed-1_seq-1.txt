"The Light That Failed"
An intensely Interesting, yet sad
story about an artist who gradually
went blind. Many people partially lose
their sight by exposure to strong llpht.
Certain rays in daylight or electric
lijfht are very harmful and useless,
others are harmless and necessary.
The useless, harmful heat and actinic
rays will not pass through Sir William
Crookes Glass, yet all the necessary
useful light does. We can make glas
ses for you that will do wonders for
your eyesight.

BANDITS KILLED

Cavalrymen Caught Mexicans Dur
ing After Dinner Siesta
THIRTY HORSES CAPTURED
Second Engagement of Punitive Ex
pedition Complete Success for
American Army.
San Antonio, Tex., April 5. Sur
prised during their siesta, one of the
groups of Villa's force driven from
Guerrero was deieated Saturday by a
squadron of the 10th cavalry under
Col. W. C. Brown, according to in
formation secured by Gen Pershing
and forwarded by him to Gen. Funs
ton here yesterday. In this engage
ment, the second the American troops
have had with Villa's men, the bandit's
loss was estimated at from 30 to 40
killed. No mention of American loss
war: made.
Col. Brown's encounter with the
Mexicans had not been reported to
Gen Pershing when he made his re
port to Gen Funston, his informa
tion being gained from friendly Mex
icans, who had arrived at a point near
Rubio, where Maj Evans of the 10th
cavalry halted Monday.
Villa s men, according to their ver
sion of the encounter, appeared whol
ly unsuspecting of the presence of
an enemy a minute before they were
attacked. It was about noon when
ol. Brown brought his cavalry with-
n easy range, l ne Mexicans were
ying about the place, many of them
sleep and 'all their horses were graz-
ng, in many cases some distance from
the men. Details of the action were
not told, but the Mexicans said that
besides those killed the Americans
captured an equal number of horses.
Gen. Pershing added that his reports
f the engagement lacked confirma
tion, though hi3 credence of tho news
was indicated by the fact that he
transmlted it to Gen. Funston.

HOW TO PROLONG LIFE
By adopting a simple diet men like
onaro have lived to be 100 years of
age, but with our complex diets of
today, the vitality of the aged is taxed
o its utmost endurance. A simple
diet, therefore, is conductive to a long
life, and if tho vitality becomes im-
miri'il and weakness seems annarent.
our local druggist, Win. L. Gokay, has
in Vinol a reliable, non-secret remedy
which contains just the elements
needed to restore strength to weak.
feeble old people, and prolong a health-
ly, happy life.

GERMAN DRIVE STOPPED
French Claim Their Lines
Held
Against Infantry Attack.
London, April 4 The French line
north of Verdun blocked today a new
and lavishly planned attempt of the
Germans to break through in the Dou
aumont sector. The assault, made at
3 o'clock this afternoon on the first
line of tho French trenches, 300 met
ers south of Douaumont village, was
completely repulsed and the Germans
were thrown back with heavy losses
Large forces were used in the at
tack which was made in the wave for
mation used so persistently by the
Germans in these rushes. Early in
tho day the German heavy guns took
up tho bombardment against the
enemy with great violence, prepara
tory to the advance of tho infantry
As the Germans climbed out of their
trenches for the assault, tho French
fire curtain was lowered and the Ger
man lines, pressing forward toward
the trenches protected by this fire
were cut down, one after another, un
til the remnants of the organizations
on tho field fell back In disorder to tl)e
Hois Chuufour. The attacking forces
were pursued by the French artillery
fire as they fell back and suffered con
slderable losses.
A German attack also was made this
afternoon against the villago of Hau
court, lust south of Malaucourt. This
attack also tho French war olllce says
was completely repulsed.
The official statement Issued In Ber
lin today snys that all tho French
counter attacks against the Caillette
wood positions havo been repulsed in
spite of repented assaults and extreme
ly heavy sacrifices.

COSTING $25,000,000 A DAY
New Taxes Proposed in England to
Continue the War.
London, April 5. Faced by the prob
leiu of financing for another year a
war costing Great Britain 5.000.000
daily, the chancellor of the exchequer
Reginald McKenna, was met at the
utset by two favorable circumstances,
namely, that owing to the expansive
lower of British trade, the revenue for
the year exceeded the estimated rev
enue by 32,000,000, while the year's
expenditure has been 31,000,000 be
low the estimate. By Imposing new
taxes on amusements, railway tickets,
matches and mineral waters, and rais
ing a number of the old taxes, includ
ing those on excess war profits, in
comes, sugar, cocoa, coffee and motor
cars, the chancellor estimates that he
will be able to raise about 65,000,-
000, which is nearly double what many

persons believed he could raise by
those means.
At the close of an able and lucid
speech in the House of Commons yes
terday, explaining the greatest budget
in the world's history, the chancellor
made an interesting comparison with
German finance, declaring that whilo
Great Britain was raising more than
3,000,000,000 annually by taxation,

treasury, Dr. Helfferich, was announc
