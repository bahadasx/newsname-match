The canvassing board met Thurday
of last week to canvass the returns of
' the republican primary election held
1 March 25 and announced the hi ding.
' At the time the board met all precincts
where elections were held, except
Millstone, were in the hai da of the
committee. It was learned that no
election was held at Pyrds Branch, but
that several from that precinct went
to Daysville and voted. The Millstone
vote was received by the secretary Erf
day morning following the canvass by
the committee. As only nine votes
were cast there their addition to the
report of the canvassing board would
make no change in final results, and
they were entered bv the secretary.

there was a qualifying clause added
which read : "to vote for him so long ;
as it may seem best to them and the
republican party of the state to do so.'
Senator Newell Sanders and John
J. Gore were instructed for as dele
gates to the National convention, that
meets in Chicago in May. While the
state is allowed four delegates at large
it was deemed best not to bind this
county to more than the two gentlemen
named and await developments as to
the other two.
As delegates to the National conven

i COUNTY COMMITTEE.
The county executive committee was
reorganized with A. L. Garrison, chair
; man, and S. C. Bishop, secretary. Ow
i ing to the fact at times there has been

com i nit tee :

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
Following the adjournment of the
republican convention the democrats
met and elected Davidson Southard
chairman and Litton Thurmim secre
tary. The resolutions contained a very
strong endorsement of the democratic
party in I he nation and state and es
pecially the foreign policy of President
Woodrow Wilson. They declared that
Gov. T. C. Rye had kept every piedge
to his party and the people and took a

to That End Friday Night.
For some days the question of Clean-;
up Day has agitated the minds of sev- j
eral ot our most energetic civic people
With the view of having every person'
in town rid their premises of the accu-1
mutation of rubbish tnat is usual each
winter.
The matter was brought to the at-1
tention of Mayor J. H. Johnson, who
stated that he was most her rtily in fa
vor of such a move and that he would j
bring it before the board at their rep
Ular meeting Friday night and that he 1
felt quite sure some MCtlon would he!
taken that would prove amply effec
tive. Just what that action will be;
cannot be known now, iut it is possible
that the city authorities may proffer
! to haul away all rubl)i"-h free for those:
who have it ready by a certain time
: and who will notify the city authori
ties. Failure on the part e &ny per-
I son to avail himself of the chance io
get his. rubbish carted away free may i
, subjcit ihem to more energetic meas-1
' ures by the city.
CITY DUMP.
j Since land is now becoming so valu
able in close proximity to town, iti
j might be a wise thin; for the city to;
establish a city Dunipat some con v en
ient point so that all refuse may he put
; in one place ;;nd the property of non
residents generally be not littered with
such rubbish.
KILL THE RATS.
There is also a movement on foot to
exterminate the rats and try to make
of Crossville a ratless town. Some
parties have receny sent away tor a
new rat bane that it is claimed petri
fies the rats after death and prevents
odor. If it proves whet is claimed for
it the new preparation will be used ex
tensively by our people in the hope of
utterly exterminating the rodents chat
infest our town. Our people will await
developments with much interest.
