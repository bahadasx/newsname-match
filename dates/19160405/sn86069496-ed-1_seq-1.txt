Church Attendance.
The church attendance in Columbia
for the past few months, has been on
the wane. It is not only proper, but
it is the duty of every church member
to be a worshiper in his or her congre

are no services in. the church to which
a member belongs, then some other
church should-. bB attended. Every
body should strive to1 make fcha . wnrM
better, and waitingupon the Lord Inl
uis nouses of worship is the most
elfective way. Get'iritbe habli of be
ing regular in your attendance and
those who have been dilatory will fol

Business Should be Active.
There is no reason why all classes of
business should not be active. There
is a ready market for hogs, cattle and
mules, and they have brought thous
ands of dollars to dair county in the
last few months. Besides the poultry
and egg business has been immense.
All that is necessary to see business
in Adair county, is the loosening of
the purse strings.- Evidently there is
a vast total sum of monev in this
county that is being hoarded. Turn
ft loose and let us have good times.
