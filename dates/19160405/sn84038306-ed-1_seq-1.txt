(Sh-i
Miss Mary Lord's, ongoing Is in the
paths of light.' In those ways,
straight, clear, cheerful, she waHoed
while here. With faith in God, and
duties toward mankind, she "chose
that better part which cannot be tak-'
*n away Worn her." The portal we
call death openfe to her a larger life.
She lived not for death, but for Jife.
Her unselfish ye*rs were full of tiiist
and toil, and with these brief years
she jeoes on to complete what endless

fidelity and kindness grew In her soul
and when she spoke and smiled noth
•in«* she gave was borrowed. She car
ried with her God's gift of goodly
cheer, and none knew her but to love
her none named her but to praise."
w»
Jn her own heart-gardens grew the
heaven-born graces and their fra
grance exhaled without conscious ef
fort. Talented, brilliant, skillful, pa
tient, she never forgot a friend, never
grew distant, and earliest loves min
gled with latest friendships, all as a
sacred trust.. When honors were sug
gested to her, or words of commen
dation, she always modestly felt tli
friends and students were giving or
saying top much. She loved the tok
ens—flowers, visits, messages but
loved the givers mere,. because slie
loved God most
Yes, Mary C. Lord lived in tfre
light—the morning light. "The path
of the just is as the shining light,
that shineth more and more unto the
perfect' day." We all, with tributes
from every viewpoint, group our lov
ing iremorials where falls the light—
the increasing light—for there and
only th^re dear Miss Lord lived, aifd
worked and only at the last, rested.
"How such holy mem'ries (duster

JwUss Lord's home has been all these
years with the lovpd ones of her im

of heaven she has carried her bene

whole community. During these last
weeks of waiting in this home on

has seemed like a queen

But for the night dews on the earth
And oft In loneliness and grief
Our purest pleasures have their
birth.

Speaking together as friend and
pastor,. our conversation was about
the journey she was about to take.
HOT voice, acquainted with the forms
of expression of several languages
told again her heart's hope of life
and pardon in Jesus Chrfct alone.
There are, however, in all languages,
no words to voice all our feeling®
and surely none to voice the light
that came into her eyes, or the old
time, heaven lighted expression that
came over her face,as we repeated th
immortal words: "There is therefore
now no condemnation to them wiiicib
are in Christ Jesus, who walk not af

Surely goodness -and mercy shall fol

will dwell in the house of the Lord
forever."
"Brighter than the glorious sunsets
Which delight this earthly clime,
