GERMANS CONTINUE I
10 STORM VERDUN
TEUTONS CONTINUE TO STRIKE I
IN THE TERRITORY AROUND
VERDUN.
The Germans still are carrying on
strong offensive operations northeast ?
and northwest of Verdun. About four
and one-half miles northeast of the
fortress they penetrated the Caillette J
wood, just outside Fort Douamont, J
after a violent bombardment. *
From part of this wood the French ?
in an immediate counterattack drove r
back the invaders.
Another powerful attack was de'livered
against that portion of the f
Avocourt wood held by the French, ?
but here the French barrier fire and c
machine guns held the Germans with- j
out gain. , * c
The French now have entirely c
evacuated the village of Vaux and t
have drawn their lines south of the i
town, but in its immediate outskirts. \
Berlin says that northeast of Hau- t
court, between Malancourt and Le
Mort Homme the Germans have en- 1
tirely cleared the French from about r
1,000 yards of trenches, where they ?
remained since the German victory e
on this sector March 30. s
r\_ xt- _ i. .4. \7 ] f
Kja ine oiner sei:wjrs> uuuui veiuuu there
have been only intermittent *
bombardments; artillery duels have s
characterized the action along the re- ?
mainder of the front.
Air craft have been very active
around Verdun. The French brought
down three German machines, but
Berlin asserts that the aerial combats
have resulted in their favor. Both
sides have been busily engaged in
dropping bombs on military establishments
at various points. Greater
activity than usual has been displayed
in the fighting between the Germans
and Russians in the region of
Baranovichi, southwest of Minsk.
Elsewhere on the Russian front the
situation is unchanged.
Three British and one Norwegian
steamer have been sunk by submarines
or mines. Two of the British
boats, the liner Achilles and the
Ashurton were on their way to London
from Australian ports. The
British steamer Goldmouth was on a
voyage to London from Texas with
ofl. The Norwegian boat was the
Peter Hamre. She was sunk while
at anchor. Of her crew of 15 only
one man escaped.
Four members of the crew of the
Achilles are missing, two ofcthe crew
of the Goldmouth were wounded
when landed, and five members of
the crew of the Ashurton were taken
to a hospital for shrapnel wounds. j
Scotland and the northern and
southern coasts of England have re- <
ceived visitations from Zeppelins, (
which dropped bombs at various
places. 1
In an air raid on the northeast !
coast of England Friday and Satur- j
day nights 59 persons were killed and J
166 wounded. i

EXTRA SESSIONS IS NOW {
ADVOCATED BY McLAURIN t
\ |
Columbia, March 30.? (Special) (
?An extra session of the General As- j
sembly to be called for the purpose \
of enacting a law for State insurance
was succested to Governor Man nine
this afternoon by John t. McLaurin, j
State Warehouse Commissioner, who
in a letter to the Governor says: "The
situation has reached a point where
it is necessary that you call the legislature
together to provide for State in
surance." He says that he is convinced
that the fire insurance companies
are determined to make a fight to the
finish and he does not believe in surrendering
to them, and the only alternative
is for the State to go into the
fire insurance business.
The Warehouse Commissioner in
"passing the buck" to the Governor
says he thought he had the cotton
warehouse insurance safe but that the
big companies are whipping the little
companies into line and that nothing
can be done. The only thing, he says,
to do is for the State to go into the
insurance business. Sen. McLaurin 1
suggests to the formation of a State
warehouse insurance by each warehouse
taking stock in a central company,
pay the premiums a year in
advance and the central company to
reinsure. t
He also approves of the formation
of mutals and suggests that the state j
make arrangements to borrow $1,- ,
000,000 to start off the State insur- i
ance company. ^

Columbia, March 29.?R. A. Coop- j
er, of Laurens, solicitor of the 8th j
judicial circuit and candidate for
Governor, passed through Columbia
yesterday on his way to Batesburg,
where he was to speak last night.
Mr. Cooper had nothing to say
for publication as to what his attitude
on public questions would be in
the approaching campaign. A defi- nite
and comprehensive statement t
"will be made in due time," he ex- t
plained. His announcement is meet- 1
ing with more generous approbation i
than he anticipated, he said. Let- j t
ters from all sections ol the state <

J. S. AGENCIES ON 7
GASOLINE INQUIRY
B
)EPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO
SAY WHETHER PROSECUTIONS
ARE WARRANTED.
Washington, April 2?Government
igencies investigating the spectacu- ,
ar rise in the price of gasoline have ^
'irtually concluded preliminary
)hases of their work and will report ?r(
o congress this week. In the mean- ?0l
ime the department of justice will gcj
:onsider the evidence with a view to ^jn
letermining whether prosecutions ,
ire warranted under the anti-trust jn 1
aw- me
Every available field agent of the ?)u
ederal trade commission has been we
issigned to the gasoline inquiry unler
the direction of Commissioner W. sec
f. Harris. Reports by the various ea(
:ompanies involved have been check- ?01
id so far as possible. Crude oil pro- cei
lucers, manufacturing companies, reE
)ipe lines, selling agencies, even tank COj
vagons, in every section of the coun- pa
;ry have been under surveillance. rer
The department of justice virtually
eft the entire inquiry to the com- jy
nission. Complaints received by the tgS
ittorney general have been forward- jn
id for investigation to the commislion
and have been added to hunlreds
of similar complaints received ^
>y the commission itself. It i6 con- ^
;idered unlikely that the attorney
general will decide finally whether ser
he evidence warrants prosecutions
mtil the commission shall have con:luded
its inquiry a month or more
lence.
The first report to congress will 10
:ontain comparative figures showing
he amount of gasoline and crude oil 12
>roduced at present and two or three
rears ago, the volume exported, rela- 1
ive costs of production, amounts 2
iold in each section of the country 8
hen and now and comparative whole;ale
and retail prices. No comment
will be made on the reasons for the
ise.
A second report, data for which is 1
lot yet complete, will supplement chj
he first with an analysis of the situ- f0i
ition and will set forth reasons to urj
vhich the commission attributes the ne]
remendous increase. als
The investigation has been con- fl0j
lucted with a view to determining 0f
our salient points as follows: ^
1. The extent of production and poi
ise of gasoline now and two and on
hree years ago. pa:
2. The volume of gasoline exported
ind the supply remaining here for e"
lomestic use particularly as to wheher
the rise or any portion of it a.r<
:ould be attributed to a scarcity of s1"
jroduct. im
3. Whether there has been dis- P*1
:rimination by big producers in favor
>f big buyers. co]
4. Whether there is actual compe- ru'
ition among the former elements
;hat went to make up the oil trust;
- * - ??- x ?i. x J 1
I mere is, to wnai extern biiu uuw
;he small independent producer is c'a
iffected thereby. ?n
The department of justice has ha
)een particularly interested in all Be
>hases of the investigation which Be
vould shed light on the possibility of ?c<
i connection between the rise and
;he administration's proposal recenty
to levy an emergency revenue tax
>f 1 cent a gallon on gasoline. This
)hase of the investigation is said to
>e incomplete.
It is understood that the forthcomng
report to congress will not fully ac<
support the recent announcement of jjj
;he department of the interior that
nore easoline was being produced ?rtl
ind cn hand than ever before. It is
inderstood that the report will state Qa,
bat the present does not mark the ruj
ligh tide of production and that while
;here is a great quantity of gasoline l '
>n hand the supply is not as large as att
t was some time ago. This report,
t is said, will be based on later fig- ?
ires than those used by the interior
lepartment.
Representative Bailey, of Pennsyl- ^
rania, announced tonight that he j
vould introduce a bill tomorrow to
tuthorize the secretary of the interi- r '
>r to sink oil wells on public lands q'
ind market the product, giving pre- *
erence to independent refiners to t
jrevent arbitrary increase in prices.

BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION
M, i
Washington, April 3.?The house . ;
naval committee brought to an end
today prolonged hearings on the
1917 naval appropriation bill. Secretary
Daniels rinsed a . thrpp-dav
statement before the committee with
a. final appeal in support of the administration's
five-year building program.
A sub-committee immediately
will begin framing the bill.
It became known tonight that a
determined effort would be made to
provide for six capital ships, two '
ireadnaughts and four battle cruisers,
as a compromise between the
recommendations of the secretary
and of the navy general board.
Mr. Daniels parried all efforts today
to get a statement as to what
relative place among naval powers
the United States should occupy. He
said the five year program he had
mapped out yrould not put the-coun- |
try in second place, in his judgment
and that the present congress could
not be asked to make up for deficien
:ies of 20 years past. At the close
of the war he believed a great opportunity
would come for international
Limitation of armament and with a
strong building program adopted, the
United States would be in a better ?
position urge that movement successfully
than if its fleet was weak.
