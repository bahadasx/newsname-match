Usual Great Crowds are
Expected to Attend
SCHOOL PARADE
SPECIAL FEATURE
Exercises at the School Building and
Exhibits In the Court House Expect
ed to Surpass Those of Past Years.
Athletic Events Will Hold the At
tention of Many.
A little more than a week remains
before the day for the annual county
school fair, which is next Friday,
April 14th. Active preparations have
been in progress in nearly every school
district of the county for the past sev
eral months and the indications are
that the fair will be largely attended
and that the exhibits and contestants
will be numerous. During he past two
weeks the tehchers and young folks
have been busy preparing for the
event ful day. Athletic fields have
1)011 busy with young fellows "get
ting in practice" while halls and class
rooms have been made to ring with
the resonant voice's of orators in 1he
making. Needles and thimldes have
also been busy, as well i as crayons and
pencils. In fact, the lines of adtivity
to be represented at the fair are so
numerous that children of every
taste and talent. are able to compete
for ribbons according to their inclina
tion.
The school fair may be roughly di
vided Into three departments, viz., lit
erary, manual training and athletic.
Oratory may be included under the
literary department, the contests in
which will take place almost entirely
in the graded school auditorium. Ad
mission to these, . except the - high
school oratorical contest at night, will
be by card only. The manual train
ing department will be in the court
house. The athletic department will
be on the graded school grounds. Con
tests will begin in all of these depart
ments at 10 o'clock in the morning, a
program for each being found in an
other place. The grand parade will
take place at 11:30 o'clock. The pa
rado will consist of pupils, teachers,
trustees, school improvement mem
hers and members of the night schools.
It will form at the graded school
school building as formerly and pass
up Laurens street to the public stuare.
As each school is expect'd to' have a
banner of its own and the children
will be dressed in fresh colors, the
parade will form a beautiful pictiure.
As is customary, picnic parties will
be made up on the school grounds at
dilner time. The dinner period is al
ways a pleasant part of the school
fair, for then it is that friends and
relatives are able to conie together
for a social hour.
The following is the program, with
the Judges and other information:
