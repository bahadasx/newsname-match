Changes At Fairbanks Factory
V
Fairbanks, Morse & Co. Have Taken the Stock of E. &
T. Fairbanks & Co Five New Directors Chosen
C. H. Morse Jr. Made Vice President, Fred C. Beck
Treasurer, A. E. Ashcroft Superintendent, J. H. A.
Bousfield Engineer and C. B. Rathburn Factory
Accountant P. F. Hazen Has Resigned.
On April 1st, 1916, representatives
of Fairbanks, Morse & Co., of Chicago
made the exchange with the officers
of the First National Bank of certifi
cates of the stock of E. and T. Fair
banks and Company for those of Fair
banks, Morse & Co., according to the
terms of the offer sent to the stock
holders January 27th, 1916.
This transaction is remarkable in
several ways, but in no particular
more than that all holders of the
stock save 15 shares have either de
posited or forwarded for deposit their
stock. These 15' shares are owned by
seven stockholders out of about 60 u
in all. The practically unanimous
consent can be considered unusual in
that only six weeks brought about the
result above stated. It is also re
markable in that it apparently shows
confidence that the business integrity
and honor of Fairbanks, Morse & Co.,
can be trusted to work out successful
ly, with justice to stockholder and em
ployee alike, the problems that con
front the management of any large
enterprise.
A meeting for the election of new
directors was held on Saturday, April
1st. The following directors resigned
and their resignations were accepted:
Gov. Henry C. .Ide, Joseph Fair
banks, A. H. McLeod, Charles A. B.
Pratt and C. L. Harpham.
The vacancies occasioned by these
resignations were filled by the election
of the following to serve as directors:
C. H. Morse, Jr., W. E. Miller, H. J.
Fuller, Thomas McMillan and W. S.
Hovey.
Who The New 31en Are.
C. H. Morse, Jr., a son of C. H.
Morse, the founder of the house of
Fairbanks, Morse & Co., is now presi
dent of that company, and was also
elected last Saturday as vice-president
of E. and T. Fairbanks and Co. Mr.
Morse, like the father he resembles
in many ways, is a man of few words,
but making every one count, and is
primarily a man of action, force and
ability. He is greatly interested to see
the St. Johnsbury factory prosper and
the scale output largely increased.
Mr. Miller is first vice-president of
Fairbanks, Morse & Co. He has been
long identified with the Chicago house
as manager. By wise planning, en
thusiastic working and sound business
judgment, he ha, accomplished much
for the business he has devotedly de
veloped. Mr. Fuller, a son of a former prin
cipal of our Academy, Homer T. Ful
ler, needs no introduction to the peo
ple of St. Johnsbury. He gained his
first business training in the scale
factory. His rapid rise to positions of
great importance is a tribute to hl
keen insight and graip of difficult

The Transportation oi
Coal in the Winter
Has Become a Big
Problem
So much so that hundreds of people
who have never done so before, will put
their Coal in during the spring and
summer months this year. Not much
change in price this year probably.
The contract. fo reconstructing the
parochial residence of Notre Dame
church has been' awarded and work
men are now dismantling the old
structure. In its place will be erected
one of the most beautiful residences
in St. Johnsbury and one which will
be both an ornament and a credit to
the village. Rev. E. C. Drouhin, the
rector, is enthusiastic over the plans
for the new house and Is entering in
to the work with much spirit.
The architects plans call for a
main building of 37 by 43 fet dimen
sions, and an ell 30 by 45. French
Gothic designs will be followed
throughout to harmonize with the
church building. Among other fea
tures a cloister on the east front and
the Gothic arches of the front porch
and windows will bring out the fact
that it is an ecclesiastical structure.
The exterior will be of red brick and
white cement mortar with trimmings
of artificial stone.
A Conservatory
The front porch will open into a
conservatory on the right and this in
turn leads around to the cloister
which takes the place of the more
common piazza or veranda. This con
servatory will be 25x10 feet and the
cloister 30x11) feet.

CROSSINGACCIDENT
Peter McDnffs Horse Killed At St
Johnsbury Center And He Some
what Injured Yesterday.
Peter McDuff who lives about three
miles above St. JohnsburyCgjnter Jad
his horse struck by a freight train and
killed, his carriage badly damaged and
himself somewhat injured a the
crossing by the depot at Centervale
early yesterday morning. The train
was a south-bound freight and the
noise of the brook beside the road
down which Mr. McDuff was ap
proaching the crossing prevented him
from hearing the train and he did
not see it until his horse was on the
track. The engine struck the horse
in the shoulder crushing it. The car
riage was considerably smashed and
Mr. McDuff thrown out. He struck
on his back on a rail on the side track.
He also complained of injury to his
arm. After the wreckage was re
moved from the highway he walked
about a quarter of a mile to the house
of Ernest McLeod where Dr. Wesley
was called to attend his injuries. Later
in the day he was taken to his home.
This accident follows very closely
the closing of the two dangerous
crossings within half a mile of the
place where the accident occurred.
