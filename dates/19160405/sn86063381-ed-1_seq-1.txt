!fiES FARMERS
TO TREAT GRAIN
CROPS FO SMUT
Bueford M. Gile, Agriculturist of Be
midji Schools, Writes
Article.
YIELD OF GRAIN WAS
REDUCED LAST YEAR
Calls Attention to Source of Waste
Which May Be Prevented for
One Cent a Bushel.
(By Bueford M. Gile)
Agriculturist of Bemidji High School.
Farmers in this vicinity will re
member that last season nearly all
the oat, barley and wheat fields were
infested with covered smut.
In reply to the question as to how
much the yield of grain was reduced
by the smut, the answers have been
from 5 to 25 per cent
Smut is caused by fungus para
sites which steal their food from the
plant and in the place where the
kernel should be, a smut ball is form
ed instead In handling the grain,
these smut balls are broken up into
dustlike particles known as spore and
get on the outside of the kernels.
Unless the grain is treated with
formaldehyde they will develop in
the plant the following year and
smut will be produced instead of
grain.
Prevention Costs Little.
The purpose of this article is to call
attention to this source of waste
which may be prevented at a cost of
one cent per bushel of seed grain.
One pint of Formalin and 40 gal
lons of water treats 40 bushels and
costs but 40 cents.
Care should be taken to get a guar
anteed formalin (a 40 per cent solu
tion of formaldehyde.) Pour this
pint into 40 or 50 gallons of water
in a tub or barrel The seed grain
should now he submerged in this
solution. A wire basket or gunny
sack should be used to hold the seed
Do not fill the sack more than half
full so that the seed may be agitated
and all of the kernels surrounded
with a coat of the solution. Dip the
grain for about two minutes, then
lift it out and let the solution run
back into the barrel. Do this three
times and agitate the grain in the
meantime. Now put the sacks in a
clean place where the rest of the
solution may drain off or dump in
a clean place and cover the pile with
the sacks for fifteen hours, when
the grain will be ready to sow. If
the grain cannot be sown within a
short time, it must be dried to pre
vent sprouting.
Wash Seeder.
After the grain is treated, it should
not be allowed to come in contact
with anything that has not been
scrubbed with a strong solution of
formalin (1 lb. to ten gallons of wa
ter The seeder should be washed
the same way.
There is another smut called loose
smut which requires a more com
plicated treatment. This smut eats
the coverings as well as the kernel
itself and is blown away by the wind
so that all that is left is the bare
stalk with a little smut sticking to
it. Very little of this kind of smut
is found in this section so the treat
ment will not be given. Informa
tion regarding this smut to parties
interested will be cheerfully given.

County Timber Unmarked as
Legally Required.
.St. Paul, Minn., April 5.Oscar
Arneson, chief land clerk of the state
auditor's office, charges that the Rat
River Lumber company of Bricks

Township 154, in Koochiching coun
ty. Arneson said that Cashin, who
was supposed to protect the state's
interest, allowed the lumber company
to cut more timber than reported

that 50,000 posts were cut when
15,000 were supposed to be cut Ar
neson said that much of the timber
was unmarked as legally required.
The lumber company denied collu
sion with the state official
