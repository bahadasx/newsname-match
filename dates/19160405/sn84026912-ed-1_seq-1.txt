There must be a good reason for this.
It is because alum was found to be un

STORY OF VILLA MURDERS.
Three Americans, Ono (.cronin, Ono
Englishman Lost Lives.
El Paso, Texas, April 1-The story
of the murder of -three Americans, a
German and an Englishman at Mi
tinea was brought here to-day by
Americans arriving from Ch-Mvuahua
City and was accepted as authentic
by Federal officials.
Tho bandits' victims were Denja
mln Snell, Dr. A. T. Snell, Lee Li-n
desloy, Americans; 'Herman Blank
enburg, a German; Donald Mc
Gregor, also known as Bruce, a Brit
ish subject. Two other Americans,
Henry Acklin and Frank Woods,
were in Mltnaca at the time, hut their
fate is unknown. The nows was
brought to Chihuahua City by .!. H.
L^clce, the only American known to
have escaped the massacre.
According to the story, Villa cap
tured 'Minara, Guorrero and San Is
adro last Monday. Everywhere he
went he announced lils Intention of
putting to death every "gringo" that
fell into his hands, and he carried
cut his intention. As far as the Mex
icans -were concerned, the bandit
promised safety to all those who did
not take up arms against him. No
quarter was shown to the Carianza
troops, Who attempted to resist him,
it was naid.
The ene gleam of light in the dark
story \'? the probability that Villa's
activity is what enabled Col. Dodd to
deliver his crushing blow at San Ge
ronimo ranch two days after the
crime of Minaca, a blow that has
raised high hopes that the brigand's
days are numbered.
Fa'r Play, and Lester Smith, of Pen

Funeral services were conducted
at Fant's Grove Baptist church, near
Pendleton, by Rev. R. W. Nelson,
and her body was laid to rest beside

Ho was a Confederate veteran, hav
ing served throughout the war as a
