Col. Dodd and 400 American
Trooper* Rout Villa
Bandits.
El Paso, Texas, March 31 ?
Four hundred American cavalrymen
under the command of Col.
George A. Dodd, galloping down
from the granite slopes of the
great continental divide, have
fallen on the main body of Francisco
Villa's bandits at the San
Geronimo ranch, scattering them
in many directions and driving
the bandit chief, wounded and
crippled, to seek a hiding place
in the mountains. Villa was
hurried from danger in a carriage.
The battle onened at f?
o'clock in the morning of March
29 and continued for seveial
hours.
The news of the exploit was
flashed into Jaurez today and
sent a thrill along the border.
For 17 hours the veteran Colon
el with his picked troopers of the
Seventh a.id Tenth Cavalry,
drove down the valley of the
Santa Maria River. At the end
of the 55-mile ride they fell upon
the unsuspecting Villa camp
where 500 bandits were celebrating
the massacre of 172 Carranza
soldiers two days previously
at Guerrero.
Villa, shot through the leg and
with one hip shattered, was hurried
from the scene barely in
time to escape the onslaught of
the Americans. The bandits
made a brief but hopeless stand
before a charge of Colonel Dodd
and his troopers.

leaving 31 dead on the field in
eluding their commander, General
Eliseo Hernandez. Two
machine guns, a number of
horses, rifles, ammunition, and
eqmpmentjell ifltojtft6?hai)ds-of "
the Americans.
Among the known wounded
is Pablo Lopez, Villa's lieutenant
in the Columbus raid. The
American casualties were four
privates wounded.
The American soldiers did not
linger on the field of victorv.
For five hours they drove the
enemy before them into the
wilderness of mountain peak,
desert, and canyon, wheie roads
or even trails are unknown and
where a mis step means death to
horse and rider. They halted
only after the chase had led
them 10 miles and the fugitives
scattered into little bands of
half a dozen men each.
Villa's career has ended; his
power has been broken. His
death or capture is only a question
of days, perhaps only hours.
Such is the inevitable conclusion
reached here as little by
little the details of "Dodd's ride"
reach the border. It seems im
possible that the crippled bandit
can long remain hidden, even in
the mountainous wastes in
which he has sought refuge.
The scene of Colonel Dodd's
victory is a broad valley king
at the head of the Santa Maria
River. To the east is a trail,
made tamous by Villa, which i
leads through the Laguna de
Castilla district to Santa Ysabel.
It was at the latter place that
Villa killed 18 American mining
men, a crime which sent a thrill
of horror throughout the United
States and marked the beginning

It was toward Santa Ysabel that
he was believed to be heading:

which have been reported here
from Mexican and American
military sources. Colonel I>odd's
men made their wav unnoticed

The colored porter in a Richmond

was given. S<
Villa is reported to have been
in a small tent nursing his injur- 2i
ies when the crash of the Amer- h;
ican volley fire awoke the ban jj
dit to panic stricken action.
The extraordinary hold the
bandit chief lias on his followers 2\
is shown by the fact that their
first thought was to save him.
Unable to walk or ride, he was
placed in a light wagon and K
driven over the rough mountain Si

known to have been killed it is ^
said the number may have been p
considerably larger. ?

Brewer Gold Mine Near Jefferson
to Be Worked Again ]
Jeffersonian
There is definite information 1
that the Brewer gold mine is to 1
begin operation about the middle '
of May and that the principal of J
ficial will be a former miner?a j
man who was financially inter- ]
ested in the mine before it suspended
operations ten years ago.
It is generally believed that the
suspension was directly due to
suits against the company by
farmers whose lands were injur- !
ed by the powder-like ground
rock empted into Fork Creek,
containing acid that make lands <
touching it entirely unproductive
as far as the water carried
the acid-charged rock. 1
The new operators have discovered
a new method of dispos <
ing of the material after grind- '
ing by which no injury is done
the lards of fanners. Its princi- i
pie is not known here. i
The mine was formerly the ;
property of the mother of Mr. 1
Wm. Randolph Hearst. She I
disposed of it to a stock com
pany of which Mr. W. U. Cly- j
burn of Kershaw was an official. <
There ate nearly 2,000 acres in
the tract, located about a mile ,
and a half from Jefferson. On it j
are gold, copper, iron ore, a sub- ,
stance of soapstone and other j
minerals. It is most interesting ,
to visit the mine and vie?r the .
rum ruins of the shafts, the deep- <
est of the three being 275 feet. ;
A tunnel 1200 yards long, 10 ,
feet through to the base of the j
hill, is used to operate a tram- ]
road for hauling: the material
from the shaft for preparation
for heating and pounding: at the
machinery building. In it
among other machines is the
huge engine, 360 horse power,
with a steam chest the size of a
small boiler and a fly wheel as
high as a one-story house. It
was hauled here from Monroe,
N. C., about 46 years ago?a
huge undertaking in those days.
Although the buildings are in 1
good condition, the crude equip- *
ment will have to be repaired; J
costly recent labor-saving de
vices are to be installed.
At the base of the hill there is
a small flow of the purest water ;
and at the spacious house on 1
the hill is an encyclopedia of
mineology in the courteous and J
accommodating person of Mr. .
John Faulkenbersy, custodian 1
and farmer.
It is estimated that it cost
$200,000 originally to put the
mine in operation. r

Baltimore, March 31.?Former c
Governor Charles A. Smith of i}
South Carolina, died at John r
Hopkins Hospital today after a
long illness, erysipelas develop- t!
ing after many months. Suffer- 11
in? from heart trouble was the
direct cause of death. Mr. Smith
had been at the hospital two ^
months. He was about 56 years v
old. *
The former Governor's home c
was in Timmonsville, S. C. He 0
was president of a Timmonsville 11
bank and was prominently c
known in Baptist educational v
circles. As Lieutenant Gover- a
nor under Blease he succeeded P
to the governorship on Mr.
Blease's resignation a few days t
before the end of his term. Mr. j'

An unharnessed, unbridled

nurse came galloping through
town last night about 11 o'clock
and fell dead on Hayne street
east of the court house. Till
horse belonged to Mr. Claud
Howie. The animal was sick
and in i4.s agony of pain ran until
it dropped dead.
A lot of highly polished, fine
grained furniture at Dillon's
furniture attracted the attention
of a number of passersby.
4What kind of wood is that?"
was a natural question, and the
reply was, "Sweetgum." Yes,
sir, just sweetgum, the kind that
grows all over this country along
the little branches and has heretofore
been considered almost
worthless. Sweetgum will make
just as fine furniture as walnut
or maple.
