NO PEACE FOR THE GERMANS
WITH MILITARISM AS PRICE,
FIRM WORD OF CHANCELLOR
n Bethmann-Hollweg, in Speech
Before Reichstag, Declares Nation
Seeks no Soil in Any Part of
America; Forecasts New Belgium
WILL NOT GIVE POLAND
BACK TO THE RUSSIANS
I5KKI.1N, April 5, (by wireless to Sayville)". Chancer von Beth-mann-llollwcff
protested vigorously in the Reichstag to-day against the
report that Germany, now or in the future, contemplated aggression
against the United States.
"The latest offspring ot the calumniating campaign directed against
us," the Chancellor said, "is a report that we, after the end of this war.
shall rush against the American Continent, and Hut we shall attempt to
conquer Canada.
"This is the silliest of all the imputations invented against us. Equally
silly are the reports that we contemplate the acquisition of any territory
on American soil, as in Brazil, or in any American country whatsoever. "
"We fight for our existence and tor our future. For Germany and
not lor ipace in a foreign counti v arc Germany's sous bleeding and dvinc
on the battlefield.
"livery one among u knows this and it makes our hearts and nerves
strong. This moral force strengthens our will in order not only to
weather the storm, but also to achieve final victory."

The Chancellor covered every con
ceivable angle of tho military and
diplomatic situation. Anion th
most striking declarations were thess:
Qsrmany contemplates no vio
lation of the Monro Dootrlns
after the war, either by conquest
of Canada or by obtaining a foot
hold In South America.
Germany will eontlnu to carry
on her submarine warfare, meet
ing England's attempts to starve
her out, though with consideration
for the legitimate rights of neu
tral. Germany will never willlnoly
consent to the return of Poland
and conquered Russian provinces
to the Czar at the conclusion ef
peaoe.
Qermany osnttmplatti the
formation after the war of a "new
Delglum," in which the rights of
the Flemish speaking reiidenti,
who are of Otrmanlo stock, shall
receive the fullest consideration.
It is folly, in view of promising
foreoasti for the coming crop, for
the allies any longer to held out
hops of starving Qermany Into
submission.
That any euggestions of peace
on the bail of destruction ef
Prussian military power would
make possible only on answer
the Qerman sword. If Qermany
adversaries desired to oontlnut
the slaughter of men and devas
tation of Europe the guilt would
be theirs and that Qerman would
have to "stand It as men."
