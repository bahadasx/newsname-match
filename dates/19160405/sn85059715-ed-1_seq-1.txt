wood, northeast of Verdun, in the
course of several engagements during

ground and again sustained
heavy casualties notwithstanding the
new formation of their attacking
parties.

| TWO MEN ARRESTED.
Two men giving the names of

night by Police Officer Vates on
chargeB of disorderly conduct. Their

a little to the northwest of Douau mont.
The Germans advanced by
short bounds towards the French
trenchos about 300 yards south of
the village. A second and third line
followed at equal distances wlt.i
. small supporting and attacking colj
uinns in the rear. This formation
has been noted during the last few
days and is regarded by the French |
as proof that the Germans have been ,
sorely punished In their previous assaults
in serried ranks.
But the charge proved Ineffective.
The first line of riflemen advanced to
within fifty yards of the French
trenches and thero had to drop to
the ground under heavy shrapnel
fire and sustained niUBketry. The
second and third lines attempted to
~ advance to the support of the first
line but were stopped far in the rear
by machine gun Arc.
The Germans !n the first line were
in a very critical position. Shrapnel
worked havoc among them. To
charge was out of the question and
as long as they remained at the point
to which they had advanced they
were exposed to a decimating Are.
The second and third lines were little
better off for they were within range
of tho French three Inch guns. The
entire attacking force Anally adopted
the only move open, retreating under
a raking Are to Chauffour wood.
They left half their number on the
field. At least three regiments took
part in the attack.
The action of yesterday Is regarded
bv military men as of great significance
as showing that the Gor
Iinans, even wun ineir new Tormatton,
are unable to escape the furious
responses of French artillery: that
the French posltons, though they
may be vulnerable at certain exposed
points, cannot be shnken, and
that the French counter offensive Is
effective.
