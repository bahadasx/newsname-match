THESLIP
AFTER SEVERAL DAYS' SEARCH
FINALLY LOCATE HIM NEAR
HIS HOME AND TAKE HIM INTO
CUSTODY.
(W. 'E. Bush, who some days ago
gave the officers the slip, and es
caped 'almost from the doors o. the
county jail, while he was being re
turned from Texas upon a statutory
charge, was captured yesterday after
noon by Officer Kendall, from whom'
he escaped, and is now in the county
jail, pending his preliminary hearing,
the date of which has not been set
by the county attorney.
Bush and the girl, whom it is al
leged he enticed away from home,
were captured at Amarillo, and when
in the local railroad yards, while dis
embarking from the train, made a
break for liberty and succeeded in
eluding the officers for a few days.
Bush has been hiding in the woods
near his home, about six miles north
of this city, and the officers have
been constantly on the watch for
him. When captured yesterday, he
stated to the officers that he was
preparing to surrender anyway, ns he
was tired of being on the dodge.
County Attorney Hardy says he
will be able to make a strong case
against Bush.

EVERYTHNG IN READINESS FOR,
BIG AUTOMOBILE SHOW THAT
IS TO BE ONE OF FEATURES
OF STYLE SHOW WEEK.
.Everything will be in readiness for
the opening of the automobile expo
sition tomorrow night, and a mam
moth tent is being erected on the
corner of Main and C streets, where
tens of thousands of dollars' worth
of new models will be on display
for the entire spring style show week.
Several carloads of new automobiles
are to be unloaded tomorrow, and
will be taken direct to the tent and
placed in position. Nearly every
standard make of car will be in evi
dence and factory representatives
from the east will be on hand to
demonstrate.
John Mulkey, chairman of the auto
mobile exposition, looks for tremen
dous crowds. Dealers in the city
have been swamped with inquiries
as to the exact development of the
exhibits. The big tent will be well
Illuminated and will have a band

seats. The Fifth Field Artillery

COME BY RAIL.
Undaunted by the'tonvntial ruins
and lowering skies, the merchants of
Ardniore refuse to see anything bit
the "silver lining," and the finishing
touches are being put on for the
spring stylo show.
Tiieo. Torgerson, chairman of the
decoration committee, is at work
with his force on the street decora
lions today, and by Thursday night
Ardniore will be in holiday attire.
Several of the buildings will also be
decorated. The exposition tent for
the automobile display is being erect

Chairman Velie Suggs of the illumi
nation committee ha.i made all ar
rangements for more electric lights
for the entire week. There will be
twice the number of arc lights during
the entire time, thanks to Bert Foster
of the Ardniore ice plant, who is
donating arcs, material ajid electricity
free of charge for the entire period.
Tomorrow, Ardniore will have but
few display windows visible. All will
be covered and will remain so until
half past seven o'clock at night, when

Interest in the automobile parade
for Monday increases each day and
the number of cars to participate will
be a record-breaker. "Dallas will be
outdone," say some optimists, "and
at least a third if not one-half of
the cars in Ardniore will be in line.
If road conditions permit, some out-of-town
cars will also be in the par
ade, one entry being from as far as
Tishomingo.
The tentative arrangements for
the parade indicate that it will be led
by Sheriff Buck Garrett on horseback,
followed by the Fifth Field Artillery
Band in three automobiles abreast,
then will come the police department,

SPORTSMEN WANT GAME
PRESERVE IN ALFALFA CO.
Oklahoma City, Okla., April 4
Sportsmen of Oklahoma, especially of
this city and the northwest part of
the stite are urging the creation of a
game preserve of several thousand
acres in the salt plains of Alfalfa
County. The state game warden has
become interested in the plan and is
considering it with a view of recom
mending that some of the money of
the gas fund that is derived from sale
of hunting licenses be devoted to ac
quiring this land and construction of
laks and shooting lodges.
A club house, commodious in size
and well appointed, is one of the feat
ures of the preserve as outlined in the
tentative plans of the game warden,
and the sportsmen who are urging the
project. The house would be con
structed from the game fynd and
would be available for any Oklahoman
holding a license from the game de
partment to shoot in the open season.
Nearly everybody reads The Ard
moreite. Do you?
DEPARTMENT IS SURPRISED AT
SHOWING MADE DURING WHAT
IS USUALLY CONSIDERED DULL
QUARTER.
Postal receipts ;;re considered the
best business barometer for any ciiy,
iind if such is a fact, Ardmore must
!;e experiencing a quiet boom that
has caused inquiries from abroad.
Tin1 receipts of the local office for
the Salary year (Milling March 111
were $:!(,2:!:!.:!ii. The nearest, ap
proach to iluse figures was for the
year l'.11, when the total reached
?js,r.ss.ii.
The biggest surprise of all wa.3 the
fact that the total receipts for the
quarter ending March 3!, lOlt!, ex
ceeded by many dollars the receipts
for the last quarter of 1913, which is
so unusual that it caused the depart
ment to write, making inquiries as to
how it happened.
The last three months of the year,
which include the holiday season, are
usually the heaviest months with all
office's, but such was not the case
here this season. There was also a
healthy increase for the first quarter
of Ifllfi over the same period of 1913,
as follows:
For 1913 the total receipts for the
first quarter were $7,203.01. For the
same quarter just ending, the receipts
were $8,830.58, an increase of $1,GI3.
57. The department states that the
increase in receipts this year indi
cate a population of 1G.O00 people,
and the increase entitles the post
master and assistant postmaster to a
raise in salary.
During the past year there has
been considerable expense added to
the local office. A free parcels post
delivery has been established, and
many other conveniences inaugurated.
For the past two quarters not a box
has been available in the local office.
When the office moves into its new
quarters many other boxes will be
added.
Ardniore is evidently growing rap
idly, according to the post office re
ceipts, and there is an indication at
present that the next quarter will ex
ceed that just passed.
Another good business barometer
is the increase in the number of tele
phones installed during the past year.
On March 1, 1915, there were oper
ated from the local exchange ,520
telephones, with approximately 10
rural phones connected with the
switchboard. On the first day of
March, 1910, there were connected
with the local office 1,708 phones,
with 133 rural phones installed.
The same rule applies to 'he dif
ference in the number of electric
lights. The increase in number over
last year is 1,212.
Ardmore suffered some severe re
verses during 1913. 'In the spring a
cyclone passed over the south part
of the city, doing considerable dam
age. Then in September, the great
est explosion in the history of the
petroleum industry wrecked a large
part of the city and caused the death
of nearly half a hundred citizens.
From all this, Ardmore has arisen,
and business was never better than
it has been this season. The oil fields
are attracting many operators, who
are making their homes in Ardmore,
and good, desirable houses are always
in demand, with the supply nearly al
ways exhausted.
