in Management; Brink Gets
the Largest Vote
IT'S FIRST REPUBLICAN VICTORY IN TULSA
Socialists Poll Less Than 200 Votes;
Robert Purdy Defeats Rose
for School Treasurer
JJHN II. Simmons, Republican,
was elected mayor of TuIhu
over Dr. C. L. Recder, Democrat,
yesterday by the biggest major
ity ever received by any candi
date in an election in this city.
The Republicans likewise
elected all four city commission
ers and the auditor by majorities
ranging from 96 to 1,200. A. W.

OninniisHiontfr No. 1.
Brink, running against Carl
Gregg, led the ticket, receiving
even a greater vote than Sim
mons. Gregg was the low man
on the Democratic ticket. Allen
A. Few was next to the highest
man on the Democratic ticket.
His opponent, A. I). Walker, was
elected by a majority of 96 votes
over all. This was the only raee
in which there was any chance
of a second election being neces
sary. Socialists Were Weaker.
The surprise of the day was
the small Socialist vote, totalling
only 179 as compared with 266
votes two years ago. During the
day the estimates of the Socialist
strength went as high as six
hundred votes, while their own
leaders were offering to bet that
it would exceed five hundred
votes. Had it exceeded five hun
dred votes there would not have
been a second election, save for
commissioner No. 4.
' A total of 3,660 voted were cast, a
figure fur below the total vote caHt in
the city election two years bko. Fully
,iifl thimiuind reRixtered voters did not
participate In the election.
The overwhelming victory wai made
poNvihle by several hundred Democrats
who voted the straiKht Republican
ticket, many of them for the first time
in their lives. It was an almost uni
versal demand for "a new deal" that

connected with the ltepublican cam
pniKii had an idea tliut we would re
ceive such a splendid majority. The
enormous vote we received will make
us all the more unxious to serve all tho
people, without regard to political be
liefs, religion or previous condition of
servitude. We will straighten out the
affairs of the city, bring about tho
needed reforms and inaugurate a gen
uine, unadulterated business adminis
tration thut every citizen will be
proud of.
A I'nitetl Tulsa.
Campaign Manuger A. A. Small ex
pressed the hope thut the election
would bring about a more united citi
zenship In Tulsa, and that all men
would stand solidly behind the new
officials to tho end that taxes might be
reduced and every other feature of
the ltepublican platform carried out.
"It has been n clean campaign," he
added, "and t have no complaint to
make ugalnst anyone. Kspcriuliy do
I desire to compliment the election
hoard for its successful efforts to con
duct a loir and honest, election."
There was no trouble at any of the
polls and no disturbances of any kind
over the election
The election board came in for the
highest praise from members of till
parties. The members worked faith
fully and honestly, and a lusting tes
timonial to their efliciency is seen in
the fact that at X:,10 o'clock last night,
Just one hour and n half after the
polls dosed, the official results were
made known through The World, and
the figures announced to a largo
crowd in lront of The World build
ing. Simmons' Majority.
Simmons received a majority over
Iteeder of 1.09(1 voles. Alis majority
over both the Democratic anil Social

Kor auditor Krunk Newklrk beat
M. J. .McNulty, Jr., by a majority of

Conli ibiiling I 'actor.
The election of a ltepublican ticket
In Tulsa can bo traced, to a certuia
t-Mcfit. to the recent stirring contest
over tho election of a liepulilican na
tional committeeman trom this state.
The election of .1. J. McOraw. the
"new deal candidate," served to
arouse Jlcpuhliians to their duty as
never before and provided the nu
cleus of the organization that hacked
the victorious ticket in yesterday's
election. The other factor was the
uction of the Democratic county con
vention Inst week in endorsing Gov
ernor It. I Williams and thereby in
directly approving the 3 per cent
gross production tax on oil. This an
gered the oil men of the city to tho
extent that many of them supported
the Republican ticket. Hut above all
these, of course, was the desire
throughout the city lot' a genuine
business administration in the city
hall.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 4.
Surprised during their siesta, one
of the groups of Villa's force driven
from Guerrero was defeated Saturday
by a squadron of the Tenth cavalry
under Col. V. C Hrown, according to
information secured by General Persh
ing and forwarded by him to General
Fuiistou toduy. In this second en
gagement the American troops have
had with Villa's men. the bandits'
loss was estimated at from thirty to
forty killed. No mention of American
loss was made.
Colonel Hrown's encounter with the
Mexicans had not been reported to
General Pershing when he made his
report, his information being gained
from friendly Mexicans who had ar
rived at a point near Itubio where
Major Evans of the Tenth cavalry wag
halted yesterday. Major Evans re
ported that Saturday Colonel llrown
had encountered a band of Villa's men
and was pursuing them through San
Antonio. Soon ufterwards Mexicans
who arrived from that vicinity de
clared that he hud overtaken the
wandering bandits at the village of
A K lias Ciilientes, twenty miles south
east of Hue hlneva.
Iliimlils Surprised.
Villa's men, according to their ver
sion of the encounter, appeared wholly
unsuspecting of the presence of an
enemy a minute before they were at
tacked. It was about noon when Colo
nel lirown brought his cavalry within
easy range. The Mexicuus were lying
about the place, many of them asleep,
und all their horses were grazing, in
many cases some distance from the
men. Details of the uction were not
told but the Mcx.cuns said thut be
sides those killed, the Americans cap
tured an equal number of horses. Gen
eral Pershing added that his reports
of the engagement lacked confirmation
though his credence of the news was
Indicated by the fact that he trans
mitted it to General Funston.
Interest Increases.
The second encounter with one of
Villa's scattered forces aroused deep
Interest ut General Funston's head

eagerly awaited, but the interest In
