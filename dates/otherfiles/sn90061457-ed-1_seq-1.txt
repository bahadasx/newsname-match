THE SI
ST. JOSEPH DECORATION
They Are Far Superior To Those Off
Any City In the United
States
"St. Joseph Is the most handsomely
decorated city that I have seen ii? niy
travels this year," remarked a Ncjw
York traveling man who mak a only

talked to a group of fellow travfelfM
In the Robidoux lobby last nlehi
"During the two weeks ju.-i vau I
have been in Omaha, Sioux City', Den
ver, Salt Lake, St. Paul. Minneapolis,
Kansas City, St. Louis, t'Meago and
here," he continued, "and In all of
those cities none can rosne within a
thousand miles of St. Joepb li point

your street Illumination is simply
grand It is past JjjcriptUn., N'one

The credit of St. Joseph's splendid
Illumination Is due to the enterprise
of General Manager J. H. "VaaBrunt
of the street railway systemi for It Is
he who Is furnishing all of' the elec
tric power free of charge, tho business
people of the city being only obliged
to pay the cost of putting up and tak
ing down the Illuminations. St. Jo
seph has certainly been well adver
tised by this stroke of enterprise on
the part of its street railway manager.

The impression prevails that the
lino will be electrified and will be
ruado a part of a new electric system
between St. Joseph and Kansas City.
This will restore to St. Joseph the
heavy trade that was cut off when the
Grand Island discontinued its service
through that rich and heavily popu

REV. J. J. RAMSEY JAILED
Is Locked Up After the Passionate
Plea of a Girl's Mother
Is Spurned
Hastings, Neb., Dec. 23. Falling
upon her knees before the Itev. J. J.
Ramsey, United Brethren pastor,
pleadlngwith him on a business streejj
to sena her aaugnter away, thus spar
ing public disgrace, only to be
spurned and refused, was the experl-'
ence of Mrs. A. A. Cobb of St. Joseph,
Mo., who today filed a complaint with
Chief of Police Crosson, resulting in
this Hastings minister occupying quar
ters In the city jail tonight.
Mrs. May Titel, who came to Has
tings Nev. 17, and who has, it is said,
since lived with and been introduced
to other ministers and churchmen by
the Rev. Mr. Ramsey as his wife, fi
nally broke down, it is alleged, and
confessed all before Chief Crosson and
several Haiitings ministers, then later
told her slory in a sworn deposition,
taken before County Attorney Fouts.
Ministers with whom the Rev. Mr.
Ramsey has been co-operating since
coining here two months ago, visited
him in jail, but Ramsey refused to
talk. Later he told an officer that he
was more sinned against than sinning.
According to Mrs. Tltel's deposition, ,
the Rev. Mr. Ramsey has another wife'
living, and her own husband is also'
living. She said her two children of
11 and 12 years were left with herj
parents when she came to Hastings
with Ramsey on the alleged promise
that they would be married as soon
as her divorce could bo obtained. '
Mrs. Titel claims Ramsey supported ,
her and the two children for two years
in Kansas City, St. Joseph and Leav-i
cuwort. She said Ramsey as a chiro-,
practic physician had often treated i
her. In a signed statement today byi
seven ministers of the local assocla-i
tlon, confidence is placed in the truth'
of Mrs. Tltel's story, and Ramsey's!
prosecution and conviction are urged.
Mrs. Titel Is tonight nt the homo of
L. J. Moore, Woodmen clerk, who co
operated with the Ministerial associa
tion In bringing to light the alleged
facts, after he had received a tip two
weeks ago from another Woodmen
camp, of which the man was a mem
ber. HAS NO PRISONERS
The Jail In Warren County Is Empty,
And There Are Twelve
Saloons There
A dispatch to the St. Louis Globe
Democrat from Montgomery City, Mo.,
says; Judge J. D. Barnett, of this city,
called attention today to an unusual
record Warren county has made dur
ing the last twelve months. There
t haa not been a prisoner In the' county
Jail In a year.
What makes the statement more
significant is tho fact that there are
twelve saloons ln Warren county.
KANSAS CITY THIRD
The Windy City at the Mouth
Kaw Fall Down Below South
Omaha As a Stock Market
Knnsns City has lost one Its great
est claims to commercial supremacy
that of the second largest livestock
market of the country, which title It
has so proudly flaunted for several
years past and what Is worse to the
windy citizens of the Windy City at
the Kaw's mouth, It has lost to a.
hated rival South Omaha, which now
holds second place In the livestock
markets of the world.
This Is shown by the report of the
Nebraska railway commission, which
was made public yesterday, and which
gives the actual figures. It Is a sad

Sees No Cause for Alarm
He did not indicate that he feared
such a contingency, however, and gave
the impression that his greatest de
sire is to have tho United States ad
here strictly to tho president's neu
trality proclamation.
It is known that since the Austrian
controversy became acute many mem
bers of congress have received letters
of an argumentative character seeking
to impress them with the advisability
or cultivating the good will of Eng
land and her allies. The writers
some of them, at least are said to
be men of influcnco in the commer-
clal ror.d, but strong pro-British
sympathizers. This propaganda is cer
tain to figure in the debates on war
issues soon after congress reconvenes.
as certain members of congress are
known to resent tho unneutral tone
of somo of these letters coming to
their desks and intend to air their
'opinions upon them. '
