From such Incomplete information

It was regarded aB a stronger possibility
that while the foreign office

of the United States the admiralty

policy has not yet been brought into j

complete information does npt alter
the crucial aspect, which this latest
development has given .to the sub-,

The general view in official quar-:

known to Austria and the Ancona
negotiations have been under <

permit instructions to reach the submarine

Episcopal Church ^Braws
Large GongregaEons.
I The evangelistic services being
held in the Adamston Methodist
j Episcopal church are increasing ln
interest and influence, dongregatlons
have been steadily growing durj
ing the week, and Evangelist Baggett
| is measuring up to the expectations
,of the people as a preacher and
: leader and one of the greatest revivals
in the history of that suburb
seems to be ln prospect.
Last night his subject was "A
Dead Faith." He was in fine condl-i
tion and for nearly three-quarters of
an hour he held the attention of the |
1 large congregation while in most1
eloquent and forceful language he
dealt with that important theme.
He seems to be an expert In deal-:
tng with varying conditions of a
community and leading folks to a realization
of their deepest spiritual
needs.
He is unsparing in his denuncla^j
tion' of shams and hypocrisy but for :
the sinner, he has the most loving
compassion.
Tomorrow at 11 a ,m. his subject
will be "An Acceptlble Sacrifice unto
God,", and at the evening service at,
7:30 o'clock his subpect will be;
"The Bearern of a Young Man's
Body." .
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30|
o'clock there will be a . young peo- (
pie's meeting at which time the young
folks will take a complete religious!
