A number of the ladies of the city
complain that whenever they have occa
sion to go into the waiting room at the

doors. Of course, when Hays gets that
new depot that was promised about two
years ago, then things will be different.
There will be a waiting room exclusive
ly for the ladies. Just wait. The
present generation will probably have
gone hence but their heirs can enjoy the
new depot with its luxurious appoint
ment. Francis Beaulieu and wife, of Sabetha
; Kansas, got off train No. 119 last Fri

On December 18, 1915, President Wil
son issued a proclamation calling the
attention of the people of the United
States to the terrible condition of the
people of Poland, caused by the awful
war now raging in Europe, and asks all
those who can to give of their abund
ance. We quote the following from
his proclamation: "Whereas, The peo
ple 01 the United States have demon
strated their sympathy for the suffer
mg people on all sides of the great
European war by their splendid and
successful charitable work in Belgium,
berbia and other places, and feeling
that the American people would quickly
respond to an appeal for help in Poland,
once the tragedy of the situation there
is brought home to them. Whereas,
feel confident that the people of the
United States", during this holiday sea
son, will be moved to aid a people
stricken by war, famine and disease;
Now, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson,
President of the United States, in com
pliance with the suggestion of the Sen
ate thereof, do appoint and proclaim
January 1, 1916, as a day upon which
ine peopie or tne unitea states may
make such contributions as they feel
disposed for the aid of the stricken
Polish people. Contributions may he
addressed to the American Red Cross,
Washington, D. C, w'lich will care for
their proper distribution."

Selecting One's Work.
Don't choose a business because
other people are making a lot of
money in it, and don't reject the pro
fesslons merely because you have
known some doctors and lawyers wtc
can't pay their bills. What you must
look for is the liiu.il of wcrk you can
do best. In that you will ba the hap
piest and most successful, even
though you never become wealthy.
J. F. Johnson, Dean of th New York
School of Commerce.
Fresh Beginnings.
Be patient with everyone, but above
all with yourself. I mean do not be
disturbed 'because of your imperfec
tions, and always rise up bravely from
a fall. There is no better paeans of
progress in the spiritual life V-2.n to
be continually heginning afresh and
never to think that we have done
enough. Francis de gales.
Why "Mercuria!.'
The adjective mercurial, like many
others, came into ordinary speech
from til realm cf astrology. In as
trological language a mercurial man
was one born under the influence of
Mercury, when Mercury was in the as
cendant, and therefore possessed of
the mental qualities supposed to dis
tinguish the heathen god.

The fortifications of Quebec are ob
solete as fortifications, but remain as
picturesque additions to the beauty
and Interest of "The Gibraltar of Amer
ica." The fortifications standing con
sist of walls and a citadel built in
1S23-1S32 at a cost of over seven mil
lion pounds- Between 1865 and 1S71
three forts were built on the Levis
side of the river, but were not armed
cr manned. Th citadel occupies
more than forty acres. No trace of
the old French fortifications remains.
Trick of the Human Eye.
Although drops of falling rain are
known to be almost spherical, they
appear simply as streaks to the eye..
Thi3 is because an indefinite number
of images of the drop are Impressed
on the retina of the eye and, owing to
persistence of vision the retention
of an image on the retina for a fraction
of a second after the object has passed
the eye gets the impression of a
streak. It is this that causes the
spokes of a rapidly rotating wheel to
appear blurred and that makes no
tion pictures possible.
"Buckeyes-
"Buckeye1 is the popular namo cf
certain American exegonous trees and
shrubs of the genus Aesculus and the
family Sapindacae. The "Ol io Hack
eye" Is a particular kind of buckeye,
and Ohio is popularly known a-"The
Buckeye State." The Ohic bye
has the botanical name of aesculus
glabra; it is a large tree, with strong
smelling bark, small obscure Cowers,
and prickly fruit containing the seed.
The horse-chestnut (aesculus hip
pocastanum) la. a near relative of the
samegenug.
Perfect Artificial Foot. ' ,
The foot of the artificial leg is in
itself an exceedingly clever counter
feit. Its core Is part of the same piece
of wood that makes the body of the
leg. Enveloping this core is rubber,
vulcanized on in a series of thin lay
ers, the result being to give the foot
a lively springiness, rendering it com
fortable for walking and helping to
give the wearer a natural gait.
Conscience, Not Consequence.
When you are in doubt as to the
course to take, consult your con
science, not consequences. Do right,
and never mind how things are going
to turn out- One who steers his
course so as to avoid everything un
pleasant, makes a zigzag course, and"
may miss the harbor at last. Follow
conscience, and leave consequences to
God.
Convictions Alone Count.
Back of eloquence, there must be
lofty conviction. Many men are high
minded, but they lack the power to
express their feelings. The convic
tions are the oxygen, and power cf
expression is the hydrogen, of public
life.
Back Home Again
I have returned from my Colifomia trip and at work again

gages, deeds, leases, or other legal papers, or attend to -your Land

Crop Payment Plan
One Crop Gets Deed
If you produce a single crop of wh3t
on the land that we offer for sale in
Fastern Colorado, we will accept it in
full for all deferred payments due us on
the purchase price. Or you may pro
duce two crops and give us half of each
and we will give 3-ou warranty deed. If
you cannot move to the land now aix
plant the crop, you may contract with
us to do the work for you and pay us
the actual cost price.
We can produce jnst as big crops ev
ery year in Eastern Colorado without
irrigation or fertilization as are now
produced on the high-priced lands in
Iowa, Illinois or Indiana. Eastern Colo
rado lands can be purchased for a price
per acre that is little mere than the an
nual interest charge on the acreage
value of the best farms in middle wes
tern states. The cash payment per
year required to buy an Eastern Colo
rado farm is little more (and in manv
cases it is actually less) than the annual
cash acreage rental now paid bv tenants
to owners of farm lar.rU in Ti'?nr.;
the tenant- has no hope of ever being
able to buy the Illinois farm. But he
can become the owner of a Colorado
farm, and pay no more annually than
he is now paying for rent alone.
The farms that we olfer for sale are
level or gently rolling prairie, situated
from half a mile to sixteen miles from
railroads and small towns. The dis
tance from town determines the price.
The aualitv of the land i ol tVio cor,
rich brown choolatp o:.i
rdeep ane sily tilled. No stcnes,
stumps or swamps. Com vields from
35 to 60 bushels per acre; wheat from
j 20 to 50 bushel-; oats from ? to G)
bushels; barley from 40 to 70 bushels;
rye from 20 to 00 bushels; potatoes from
ft) to 200 bushels; alfalfa. 2 to 3 tons;
sudan grass from 3 to 7 tons; broom
I corn, one-third ten; boar.s, fiOO to 1,(KX)
'pounds. Other crops successfaiiy grown
are kaffir, feterita, milo maize, beets,
cabbage and arsons. Everything ha3
an instant market when hauled to town.
i Creameries pay cash tor milk.
The land is only six or seven hours
! from Denver and only overnight from
the great markets of Kansas City and
Omaha. The climate of Colorado is un
surpassed. The summers are cool, the
winters mild. Domestic water is found
in abundance and is of purest quality.
Fuel, lumber and cement are cheap.
Taxes are low; only about $40.00 per
square mile. Roads are excellent.
You can buy a farm on the regular
terms of one-third down and balance in
three to five equal annual installments
and keep all the crops yourself, or we
will contract to plant crops for yoa and
turn ail the proceeds over to you. We
have some farms fcr sale on ten years
time. A few farms i;ie improved. If
you would like to own one cf these
Colorado farms we am show you how
to get it. Prices will be double in very
short time. Now is the time to buy.
Come with us to Colorado and see the
amazing tnings with your own eyes. A
single crop will pay the entire purchase
priae of the land at prices now asked.
