BRITISH STEAMER IS
SUNK; TWO HUNDRED
MAY HAVE PERISHED
LONDON, Jan. I.—Between 75 and 200 person*, many of them helpless women
and children, are believed to have perished when a submarine sank the Peninsular &
Oriental liner Persia, south of Crete, Thursday. Aboard her were at least two Amer
icans, U. S. Consul R. N. McNeely, en route to his new post at Aden, and Charles
Grant.
Only four boat loads of survivors were reported to have cleared the sunken vessel.
These landed at Alexandria today.
The 7,974 ton steamer, third largest English vessel to fall victim to submarine war
fare, carried 231 passengers, including 86 women and 25 children, and a crew of
over 100. A third American, Edward Rose of Denver, booked as a passenger, is
thought to have quit the ship at Gibraltar.
With news that only four boats cleared the ship, fears of grave casualties grew
apace.
Advices received here said that the Persia was sunk southeast of Crete. First re
ports left doubt as to whether the ship was given warning, or whether she attempted
to escape.
The Peninsular offices stated they had had no word concerning the Persia since
Tuesday, except for a brief dispatch that she had been sunk, probably with large
casualties.
