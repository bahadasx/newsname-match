With the passing of the year 1315
an era of prosperity in Grady county
r
will go into history an era of pros-
erity which materialized despite the
adverse conditions which marked the
fpening months of the year.
fV The history of the closing year
shows that Grady continues one of the
: heBt agricultural counties in this pre
eminently agricultural state, and
' . that the farmers of Grady county may
' oe classed among the most progres
sive and enterprising tillers of the
soil to be found in any state in the
union.

Verden Man Accused of Theft of Horses
in Colorado, is Dismissed After
Preliminary Hearing; Re
turns Home
About two weeks since John D.
Graham of Verden was arrested at
request of the olficers of Ilaca county,
Colorado, by Sheriff Bailey and later
turned over to those ' officers and
taken back to Colorado upon charsges
of being implicated in the theft of a
car of horses.
As told in the Express at that time.
Graham asserted his Innocence and
returned to Colorado without requisi
tion papers, claiming that a thorough
investigation would prove conclu
sively that he had no hand in the
horse stealing offense with which, he
was charged.
Yesterday Graham arrived at his
home In Grady county, his discharge
having been ordered by the Colorado
judge before whom he was arraigned
preliminarily.
As a proof of his Innocence of the
offense Mr. Graham was given a letter
from this judge which follows:
"Stonington, Col., Dec. 29, 1915.
"To Whom It May Concern:
"This is to certify that John
Graham proved beyond the possibility
of a doubt that he .was not guilty of
the crime charged against him and Is
therefore released therefrom.
"BARNETT H. JONES.
"Justice of the Peace."
Graham's preliminary was held
Tuesday. He saya the only evidence
against him was that a "slim man
wearing glasses," answering to that
extent to his own description, was
s-cen with the stolen horses and
Graham proved by a number of wit
ncsses that he could not have been
connected with the crime. He re
turned to Colorado to face the charge,
without a requisition.

PROGRESS MADE BY
CHICKASHA CHURCHES
DURING CLOSING YEAR
Not alone In a material way did
Chickasha prosper during the past
year. Reports of the year's work in
religious circles show that all of the
churches in the city made marked
progress in 1915:
Epworth Ma.'hodist Church.
Dr. J. A. Olds, pastor of the Epworth
Methodist church, has one of tlu
largest congregations In Chickasha
under his charge. The membership of
this church Is composed of conscien
tious workers in the cause of religion
and the deepest Interest is ever mani
fested in all manners of church ad
vancement. The Sunday school is
particularly well attended and shows
a remarkable increase for the year
just closed. All societies of the church
are harmoniously conducted, the ac
tivity being in evidence at all points.

deputy in the happiness department of
the court clerk's office, stated this
morning that December showed a total ;
of 57 marriage licenses issued for the
month, while the number of divorce j
suits filed had dwindled down to an
insignificant eleven.
A total of only thirty-seven suits of
all kinds were filed during the entire
month, all ot which would seemingiy
indicate that the people ot Grady
county are becoming less prone to

Smith has flourished in a most satis
factory manner. The attendance has
been good at every service and the In
crease ini membership has been such
as to evidence the high esteem in
which eh pastor ia held by all. The
Sunday school of this church has par
ticularly flourished. One year ago
nbout two hundred children attended
this Sabbath school and now the num
ber has been swollen to almost three
hundred. Sixteen active classes com

school of the Christian church while
one of the largest and most interest
ing adult classes in Oklahoma meets
every Sunday.

over by Rev. C. P. Hailey shows pos

church in Chickasha during the past

LUSTY HOWLING AS
BABY YEAR IS BORN
Did you hear New Year come in
last night? Or were you like every
body else and just thought the noise
was either a fire alarm or the music
of the advance guard in some raid or
other?
A trifle prematurely, about one min
ute and sixty seconds so, a switch
engine down in the Rock Island yards
turned loose with the announcement
that 1916 was a "borning." Scarcely
had this whistle began to jar about
through the prevailing aemosphere,
when some one with noise in their
hearts and murder in their souls un
limbcred a large and ill-mannered
piece of artillery composed, possibly,
of two anvils each loaded with noise
making powder and laid face to face.
Following this, big guns and little
puns and big whistles and little
whistles turned loose and "volleyed
and thundered" for several consecu
tive minutes. Then, when the attend
ing physicians announced that 1916
had been born and that, the youngster
was a fine and a lusty one, the noise
makers disbanded and the balance of
the. population of Chickasha again
pounded the pillows.
Miss Mabel Linda returned yester
day evening from Durant from Durant,

GREATEST YEAR IN
HISTORY OF COLLEGE
By PRESIDENT AUSTIN.
The die is cast, the year Ib ended,
and the results speak for themselves.
The Oklahoma College for Wromen
closed Its doors for Christmas vaca
tion one year ago with an enrollment
of 215 young women and this last De
cember sent 367 girls coming from
forty-eight counties to their homes
singing the praises of Oklahoma's
only girls' school. More than two hun
dred applicaiions for rooms in the
dormitory were returned for the lack
of accommodations.
I do not regard this unusual devel
opment as the most Important feature
because It takes more than numbers
to build a great institution. The
greatest progress the school has made
during the last twelve months Is its
growth in the hearts of the people of
this state. The citizens have found
cut that their daughters are looked
after here and they are given the char
acter of training that makes good wo-
FORWARD STEPS TAKEN

virtually prisoners at the Royal
Shooting club and were guarded by
police last night to prevent them from
becoming the object of attack of Nov
Year's eve merry makers in the

They promised American M.nlstcr
Egan not to lenre while the banquet
was in progress. The entire delega

Governor Hanna, who is seriously
ill in a hospital here, is reported
better. Rev. Dr. Aked remained in

MASONS MOVE QUARTERS.
AH the furniture, fixtures and equip
ment ot the Chickasha Masonic lodge
was moved this morning from the old
lodge room on Chickasha avenue into
the front of the third story of the
Schluter building at the northeast
corner of Third street and Chickasha
men. The standards of the institution
J have been raised until it is recognized
today as one of the leading schools of
the state.
I had a vision not long ago and I
saw a magnificent fine arts building,
a great science hall, and three large
dormitories standing on the campus,
and I heard the voices of one thousand
Oklahoma girls chanting the praises of
O. C. W. Thel flight of years was rapid
and the curtain rose again and the
finished product was before me. I
saw one thousand well kept homes in
this great state managed by one thou
sand former pupils of the Oklahoma
College for Women, and it was then I
recognized what tha state was receiv
ing for the Investment in her girls'
school.
We are now in the midst of the
greatest year in the history ot the in
stitution and I am of the opinion that
this Is the worst year the school will
ever see. Yours for service,

school 2,436.
The increase as above shown called
for enlargement in school room facil
ities. This is a matter that was very
generously cared for in the recent
declaration by vote of the people for
a new junior high school building.
The school spirit among patrons,
pupils and teachers was never better.
It is the very soul of progress and
better things educationally. We
prophesy that the close of the year
1916 will find our city schools well
along on this forward movement of
better schools and better school facil
ities for all the children of this city.

Only Four Boat Loads
Saved
RAISES NEW PHASE
OF CONTROVERSY
Washington Officials Amazed by Attack
Coming in Wake of Austrian Answer;
Dr. Griel Makes State
ment By United Press.
LONDON, Jan. 1. Many lives are
reported to have been lust when the
Peninsula and Orient liner Persia was
sunk in the Mediterranean sea Thurs
day, presumably by a submarine.
According to reports received hero
only four boat loads of passengers and
members of the crew of the liner were
saved.' The Persia was enroute to
London.
The vessel that was lost had a dis
placement of 7,794 tons, buing only
slightly smaller than the Italian liner
Ancona. Excepting the Lusitanla the
Persia was the largest British liner "
sunk by a torpedo, If reports that she
was submarined are true.
The latest dispatches state def
initely that the Persia was subma
rined. "The Persia carried many pas
sengers and a large crew," said an
official of the line. . "We have no
definite figures to give out now."
Officers said that not over two hun
dred persons on board the vessel
could have escaped in four life boats.
In commenting on the statement that
only four boats managed to clear, they
said in all likelihood the nnrabu- of
survivors was considerably less than
two hundred.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 1. A new and

controversy confronts the United

Contradicts Austrian Report.
By United Press.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1.- 3. Cecile L.
Greil, the American survivor on the
Ancona, takes issue with the Austrian
note regarding the sinking of the liner.
"The submarine that sank the An
cona fired fifty or more shots at her
instead of sixteen as stated in the
Austrian note," said Dr. Greil. 'Every
shell was fired after the vessel
stopped, while eiforta were beins
made to lower the boats."
Dr. Greil said the submarine circled
about the liner, keeping up its fire
all the while and disappeared along
the surface without making any at
tempt to rescue the passengers. Sna
says the Ancona's boats were not low
ered till she stopped.
