Thirteen al Dinner
- 'I lie leulli of W illiam J. Mills is
the second amoim thirteen men who
gathered as guests of Federal Judge
illiam II. Pope at Santa Fe a few
weeks ayo. It was a reunion of the
juoges and ollieers iif the territorial
supreme court over which both gov
ernor Mills and Judge l'ope had pre
sided. II was at this dinner thai the late
Judge Kdward A. Mann uttered these
pr pln iic words: "It is unlikely
lh.il til of us wilj ever be together
am in." The llashlight pictures taken
at lint banquet are, perhaps, the last
photographs of both Judge Maun
and Judge Mills.
I'pon learning of the death of Ex
(iovernor Mills. A. W. Thompson,
one of the few really, truly old
timers now living in Clayton, re
culled a bit of history relating to
lhi time in Clayton when stirring
events 'were the rule rather than
the exception.
it was Ex-Governor Mills who
passed sentence on Black Jack, (T.
E. KctchuiiO the .notorious outlaw
who for 'ten or twelve years ter
rorized northeastern New Mexico
uud who was the only person ever
banned in I iiion county. Itlack Jack
and bis carefree depredation were
permanently suspended at the end of
a rope the morning of April 25th,
; I '.Ml-.
Mr. Thompson has a souvenir of
this occasion that he treasures very
highly. He terms it the "last will
and testament of Itlack Jack. The
night before the deafli of the out
law Mr. Thompson called at the jail
to 'w ish the condemned man good
luck on his journey. As a momento
of the visit Itlack Jack scrawled with

T..K. Ketchum
Wanted Priest to Fiddle and Dance
How Itlack Jack kept up bis brav
ado to the lust is related in a little
incident at the jail the night before
his execution when a priest called
to lend the bail man assistance in
making peace with bis God. itlack
Jack rudely informed the priest that
be "didn't want any prayin' " and
that if the priest was unable to en
tertain him by "fiddling or danc
ing ins services were not wanted.
i How Mack Jack Delayed the Train
!One of Itlack Jack's escapades in
Clayton that has never been pub-
limbed was planned iy the outlaw
ii a moment's notice to accomodate
.ids employer, Capt. Iay, for whom
4 1 was punching tattle. Capt. iay,
w; and perhaps always has been
. in ignorance of the "accomodation."
Capt. hay and bis outfit drove into
Clavton with a bunch of I'ecos cat
tle in I.S'.)i, shortly after the railroad
liad been built. At that time there
Wi re but two or three store buildings
in Clayton, among them Tom Gray's
saloon Jhd the mercantile firm
which the late Geo. ltushuell was
associated.
Capt. Iay received a check of
home. ;t).Oti) for bis cattle whihj
here which he deposited with Mr,
ltushuell asking for ?I,IKK) spending
- .money ' '-vit. Une thousand dollars
".
in currency was not, to be had in
those days in Clayton hence a bank
in Trinidad was wired to send the
amount by express on the night
train. The expressman informed
Capt. I ay that bis chance of getting
the money package depended upon
how long the train stopped. The
aptaiu casually mentioned this lo
itlack Jack who said nothing but
ieeided that it was proper that the
rain should wait and give bis boss
i chance to get the money.
A typical cowpuncher poker game
.vas in progress at Tom Gray's when
he train whistled in. I'pon its ar
rival a figure slipped out at the
rear of the thirst parlor and under
over of darkness made way toward
.be station. The engineer climbed
town from his cali and began oiling
ip. On the side of the engine op
posite the slalion he was struck over
the head with the butt of a six
diooler, nearly knocking him out.
.le regained bis senses enough to
all to the fireman to hand down a
:un. The engineer could dimly dis
'eru a figure scooting for the saloon,
.fused his gun and took two random
duds at it. The bullets whistled
.larmlessly away and the pokir
ame was again full handed.
lty the time the engineer bad ex-
lained to Constable LecK VV'amsley
his reason for shooting and had bis
Aound mended the 1 rain bad been
leluyed fifteen minutes and Capt.
ay was able to receive the money,
'thick Jack afterward confessed
hat he created and executed this
lelicale piece of work. Primitive
hough it was it got the desired result.

Chiylou business linns put out

Among the best are F I'. kilhurn's

The former's calendar is u full color

ling Farewell to his Victorious
Ship." The subject is one that ap
peals to everyone. It depicts the
victorious American standing on the
deck of the captured Itritish vessel
vvith his hat raised in farewell sal
ute to his own ship which is burn
ing and sinking.
"On Guard," Pope's famous paint
ing showing a lioness ready for eni
rgency should anything disturb
the peace of her cubs, is a large

if Commerce has put out to the
Misiuess houses. Their calendar for
the homes is a tastily mounted hand
.olored photograph.

a large reproduction that bears the
ear-marks of the famous Tims. Mo

The Ill-fated Pilgrim Buck;
The dollar with the card attached,
bearimr the legend: "What a Dollar
Will ltuy in Clayton" which C. O.
I Hum sent on its voyage struck a
reef about the fourth day out. The
dollar perished lint the card was
washed ashore. A delegation of
business men recovered the card,
Frank Itarnharl supplied the dollar
and the pilgrim was again sent forth
in cpiest of the desired information.
C. O. I tun was the llrst to
part with the doliar.
"It is mine"
So said Mr. Iiunn, bul be went
forthwith to The News olllce,

and admitted that lie needed

scended into the village and he
bargained for the attire and
for the foxy -tripes thereon

, "It is mine"
Said Mr. Her.stein but like all
thoughtful and considerate
folks, he did bis Christinas
shopping early and spent the
dollar ut Hold. Isaacs for a
child's silver set.
"It is -niine"
Said "t'ncle H"f'W but be
suddenly reineinlii i . u thai the
correspondence department in
his store was out of stamps
nod he spent the dollar al the
post ollice. Postmistress Mrs.
Pace exclningi'd even with the
post ollice for the wandering
dollar and exclaimed
"It is mine"
Hut Mrs. Pace noticed that her
Overland needed some oil,
hence did her share to assist
the coin on its way by buying
a gallon of oil at the Clayton
Garage & Auto Co.
"It is mine"
Chuckled Chas. Monroe, man
ager, hut he did not keep it
long. He cheerfully kicked in
and bought a dollar's worth of
coal of O. U. Granville. Geo.
Squeezed the buck and declar
ed "It is mine" .
That was the beginning of the
end. Granville unconsciously
steered the wandering buck
straight onto the reef. He
bought four pounds of a cer
tain food, in a certain place of
business. He lished out the,
wandering dollar and parted
with it as cheerfully as be had
received it. The proprietor of
this place took the dollar, rip
ped the card from it, buried
it in the cash register und with
profound conlldence announ
ced: "It is MINK!"
Such was the fat of the wan
dering buck. Although a sharp
lookout has been kept, to our
knowledge, il has never come

Special Itond Flection
Special election has been called

From what information we have
a new huilding uud equipment is
badly needed. The grade schools
overflowed this year and one or two
grades bad to be quartered in an
other building. We also understand
that if this improvement is made
the Clayton high school will be
placed permanently on the accred
ited list which means that a Clay
ton High school graduate is eligible
to any state school without special
examination.

Attorney General Says that Coyote

Not l'iilawrti!.
The rabbit drive proposed by H.
J. Hilgers met with general favor
until the question of hunting license
was brought up. Handlers all ob
jected to procuring license simply
to partake in a rabbit drive. A
story in the Santa F'e New Mexican
in which the opinion of Attorney
General Frank W, Clancy is set forth
in no uncertain terms should calm
the fears of all relating to liability
of arrest for hunting rabbits a id
trapping coyotes. The opinion was
rendered in reply to a letter from
a man in Mona Ana county. It reads
as follows:
"I have today received your, letter
in which you say that an old Indian
from Tortugas, situated below the
state college, has come to you and
said that the Indians wero not per-y

can say lo the Indians that there
no need for them to buy licens'
in order to kill rabbits in their a,
customed manner which you d '
scribe in your letter as having: b-'
their method from time immemor
by which the whole village

of the game which is protected'1 b.
law, sueh as ducks, quail, grouse,
turkeys and doves, as that would
subject them lo punishment under
the statute. Itabbita are not in any
way protected by law from being
killed.'
"The impression that any sue!,'
license could be required for per ;
sou to kill rabbits has grown out
an injudicious statutory provi
enacted by the last legislature "
