During the Day.

Feeling Due to War.

Blowing of Whistles. Ringing of
Bells and the Sound of Fireworks

Throughout City.
\
Although Washington's princim
pal New Year function, the reception
at the White House, was
omitted this year, as it was last
year, capital residents almost forgot
the omission in the multitude
of other receptions and "openhouse"
affairs with which the advent
of 1916 w as observed.
Cheerless, misty and gloomy,
with portending rain or snow, the
New Year made its advent under
inauspicious circumstances as far
as the weather was concerned.
The poor weather conditions,
however, failed to chill the ardor 1
of New Year celebrants; it might
be as nasty as could be imagined
out of doors, but within hundreds
of Washington homes, in the
flinrelioc tit fliiKc lintolc nirl
other places there was no lack of
New Year cheer,
k The usual receptions were held
at the homes of most of the members
of the cabinet, while in diplomatic
circles the day was observed
much as usual, in spite of
the fact that a second New Year
has rolled around to find relations
still suspended between a number
of the most irrfportant embassies.
F.ven the "diplomatic breakfast,'" j
in \ ears past an annual event of;
the day. was omitted bv Secretarv
I.ansing. the Secretary being out
of the city over the holidav.
Greetings Sent to the President.
New Year greetings from all over the
world wv?re received at the White
House and were forwarded to ihe
President at Hot Springs. Va.
Wherever friend met friend today,
whether on the street, in hotel lounges,
in the clubs, on street cars or wherever
it might be, the usual New Year
felicitations were exchanged, smiling
faces and hearty greetings being in
strong contrast with the weather.
Owiri# to the fact that government
employes were enjoying a holiday,
which began at noon yesterday, and
also owing to the bad weather, the
downtown streets wore a deserted air,
only those who were compelled to do
so venturing out of doors during the
forenoon. Most of Washington's New
Year -elebrating occurred last night,
when New Year e\e 1916 was ushered
it with the blowing of whistles, the
ringing of bells, the sound of fireworks
and firearms and the exchange
of greetings among those gathered at
hundreds of watch night parties in
private homes, as well as at more pubI
< places. Many of the churches of
the city held watch night services,
which began around 10 o'clock and
continued until after the clocks had
chimed midnight and marked the passing
of 1315 and the birth of the newyear.
Old Year Backs Off Stage.
1916 Is Hilariously Greeted,
as Bells Toll Midnight Hour
When the little baby 101 > tumbled
acrosn the line at midnight he blinked
his eyes and wondered what, in the
name of < orrirjion sense all that noise
wa* about, and where all those funny
paper hats came from; and battered
old 1dl."> shot off into oblivion with a
lot of other bygone years to the tune
or at least a million horns and whistle*
The old year didn't have :t chance
to see his successo^, they shoved him
hack into oblivion so hard, turned the
lights out on his exit and sang a lot
of haNew Year songs for the special
benefit of the kid However, as
101."i left he was heard to say t^at he
hoped the boys would be out of the
trenches by the time 101# had whiskers.
Mixing of Statistics.
The statistics of last night's New
Year eve celebration grew mixed as the
evening progressed. Conservative counters
made it 3.000 diners in hotels and
restaurants early in the night, but later
counts doubled that number?for some
reason or other. Hotel chefs were overworked
?o were the orchestras, and if
>ou::g Mr 1018 can ever learn all the
various steps that were danced about
the dining tables last night he will he

if he ever learns why It is funny to
blow a loud tin horn in a woman's ear
he will be a philosopher. Washington
last night again laughed at people
wearing colored paper hats and tooting
looters Alas, says little 1918. this Is a
funny world!
in one of the biggest hotels the main
Ml celebration was in the ballroom on th?
tenth floor, where more than 650 (earlj

Greek Camp Shelled.
"The Greek camp just outside the
town apparently was mistaken for entente
allied quarters. A bomb was
dropped there and exploded near the
divisional general's headquarters, killing
one; shepherd and four sheep.
"The scenes during the air raids have
been reminiscent of the Zeppelin visits
to London, except that they have occurred
in the daytime. The movements
of the raiders were closely followed
by the populace.
"As the shells seemed to he getting
nearer the aviators they swerved their
machines or dodged or altered their
directions. Throughout* the aircraft
remained at high altitudes, some of
them at 9,000 feet. The crowds gathered
in the streets cheered when shells
burst close to the machines. It is reported
that two of the aircraft were
hit during the first raid."
Possible Future Action.
BKP.L1N, via London. January 1.?
Gen. Jecoff, commander-in-chief of the
Bulgarian forces, is quoted by a correspondent
of the Tageblatt as having
declared as late as December 26, during
an interview at Bulgarian headquarters,
that no decision had yet been
made as to whether action would be
pursued against the Anglo-French expedition
upon Greek territory.
The general stated, says the correspondent,
that the problem of the continued
presence of the entente expedi
i* CatmSb-t r.,1 r.f further iictinn
against it by the Bulgarian and Austro-German
allies involved questions
primarily of a political nature in which
military action was dependent upon
negotiations which were uncompleted
at that time. He asserted that the danger
from the presence of the AngloFrench
forces at Saloniki was above
all political since the entente powers
undoubtedly hoped through the resultant
complications to drag Greece into
the war on their side.
Serbians Not Pursued.
(Jen. .Jecoff intimated that the Bulgarians
had abandoned further pursuit
of tlie remnants of the Serbian army
into Albania not only on account of
the wretched communications, but also
because of political considerations.
The Albanians themselvf*?, however,
were attending to the completion of
the destruction of the Serbian army,
he said.
Passing to the general consideration
of the war. Gen. Jecoff said he doubted
whether the world conflict would
be decided in the Balkans. Russia
was scarcely in a position to bring this
about. The entente allies could only
endeavor to force such a decision by
offensives in the west and the east.
He said he saw no immediate possibilities
of peace, at least not before the
middle of the spring, since the entente
allies set vast hopes upon a new offensive.
The crisis could come only
when this plan was broken down.
Greek Attitude Firm.
The Soda correspondent of the Lokal
Anzeiger, who lias just returned from a
long visit at Saloniki, declares that
trality at all hazards, and will abandon
it only If forced to do so by reason of
the Bulgarian troops not leaving Greek
territory when the operations against
the Anglo-French forces are completed.
A Bulgarian authority, adds the correspondent,
has declared that this contingency
is out of the question.
ASKS COURT FOR MANDAMUS.
Woman Graduate Seeks Membership

NEW YORK, January 1.?Mrs. Nora
Stanton Blatch, a daughter of Mrs.
Harriot Stanton Blatch and a graduate
of Cornell I'niversity with the degree
of civil engineer, has filed with
Supreme Court Justice Ford an application
for a writ of mandamus requiring
the American Society of Civil
Engineers to admit her as a member.
Mrs. Blatch alleges that she has
learned through conversation with
various male members of the society
that her application for associate
membership, which was rejected, did

was not professionally fitted, but because
she is a woman.

re regarded as almost parallel. It was in
enerally presumed in official circles ^
lat. as was the case in the crisis with 1
ermany, the Austrian admiralty and a
ie Vienna foreign office are working ft
t cross purposes.
Officials Decline to Comment. m

It was regarded as a strong possibil- fc
:y that while the foreign office is tl1
eadv to accede to the contentions of

n the success of its submarine policy, w
as not yet been brought into line. 'J;
There is. however, the added possibily
that the submarine which sunk the
ersia. being far from home, had not

le Austrian government. ni
The destruction of the Persia, coupled
ith the recent sinking of the Japanese Ul

ner Ville de la Ciotat, lends strength Vi

ilities.

VTIC RELATIONS
spect which this latest development

rews Astounds Official Washington.
The general view in official quarters
as that the position of the United
tates was sufficiently well known to
ustria, and the Ancona negotiations
ave been under way a sufficient length
f time to permit instructions to rea h
lie submarine fleet. On every hatid
le news was received with asionishicnt.

As in similar cases, the policy of the
merican government will be to await

Assumed to Be Austrian Boat.
Although the nationality of the subarine
which sunk the 1'ersia remains
testablished definitely, as was the
se with the Yasaka Maru and the

is that it was an Austrian boat,
