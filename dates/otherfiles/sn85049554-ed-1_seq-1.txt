Predicts Victory for Allies in 1916.'
IL'ondon, Jan. 1.—The Reuter Tele
gratn Company says that Emperor
William, according to the Berlin cor
respondent, has sent the following
New Year's greeting to the army and
navy:
"Comrades: Another year of fight
ing has, elapsed. Wherever a superior
number of the enemy have stormed our
lines they have failed before your
loyalty and brewery. Wherever I have
sent you into battle you have .gained
a glorious victory. Today, above all,
we remember oqr brethren who gave
their blood to protect our loved ones at
home and for the imperishable-glory
,of the fatherland. What the^ have
begun we will accomplish, with God's
gracious help.
"In impotent madness enemies from
the west and east, from the north sn&
south still seek to deprive us of all that
makes life worth living. They long
ago buried the hope to conquer tis in
honest fighting. On the weight of their
masses, on the starvation of .our en
tire people, on their, campaign of
calumnitlon, which is as mischievous
as it is malicious, they believe' they
can still reckon. Their plans will irot
succeed. Before the spirit of deter
mination which imperturbably unites
the army and those at home, their
hopes will be miserably disappointed.
Wlth a will to discharge the duty to
the fatherland to the last breath, and
determination to secure victory," we

BERLIN WANTS INCIDENT ENDED
German Press Withholds Comment on
Austria's Concesaions.
Berlin, Dec. 31,' via London, Jan. 1.—
The newspapers here find the Austro
Jbjungarian reply to the demands of the
United States Concerning the sinking,
avoia tomplicating 'the negotiations.
USToflfe of the- morning .jjaper? fomr
men ted on the note and afte^npon-,pa
pers displayed., some reticence. Only
the Cjitholic Germania and Kreuz Zei
tung discuss ,lt at ali, and their obser
vations* are Short and restrained. The
Germania says:
"VVe are convinced that this note will
malie a most excellent Impression in
th«i United States, and will cause many
citizens there .to form their own opin
Ions of president Wilson's first note, it
may in any case, lead to the realiza
tion that .courtesy to the utmost limit
and circumspection in judgment belong
to|the best methods of diplomacy.
Holds Act Justified.
"Baron Burian's reply contains a
most brilliant justification for the ac
tion against the Ancona, which we can
Imagine. All, even the .most extreme
demands of humanity, are observed in
model fashion, and the fact that the
Austrian commander has been pun
ished, despite all his precautions, be
cause he failed to take further into
consideration the'panic of passengers
duie to the Ancona's crew, shows what
regard is paid, even to the exaggerated
viewpoint. Wtyeri'the more than.noble
fashion ip .jfhich Austria-Hungary is
willing tQ pay.- compensation,, is also
considered, it: must said there is not
the slightest doubt but there will be
a- smooth settlement of the contro
versy. Were Mr, Wilson to find on
the part of our enemies half so cor
rect an attitude and willing to com
promise as 'on our-side differences re
garding the methods of naval warfare
would long- since have disappeared."
The Kreuz Zeltung says:
"•In"Its concession that hostile mer
chantmen, not attempting to resist or
flee, may not be destroyed by placing

mits that submarines are submitted in
war-.upon, commerce to all and even
more than all the restraints Imposed

mode of combat of submarines is ut

It was regarded that while the for
