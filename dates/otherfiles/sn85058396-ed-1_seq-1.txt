AND NOW FOR ONE 1
MORE NOTE.
President Wilson and Secretary of I
State Lansing have another opportun I
ity to write a note. Another liner has fl
boon "torpedoed without warning and I
nearly every one on board lost. The
submarine, which did the outrageous
work, was operating near Alexandria,
Egypt, and was either Austrian or
German, presumably Austrian.
The utter futility of this note writ
ing is made evident by this last dis
aster. On the very day that Austria's
note was dispatched to Washington,
offering an apology, or rather an ex- I
planation of the Ancona massacre, a j
large steamer, carrying two hundred
or moro passengers, including a num
ber of Americans and many women
and children, is sent to the bottom
Now, in the due course of time, the
United States government will for
ward another note, protesting against
tho inhumanity of this 'form of naval
warfare and warning Austria that our
feelings are hurt Then Austria's
foreign minister will make a sweep
ing denial as a preliminary move to
delaying consideration of the subject
The United States will insist that an
outrage has been committed. The
whole question will be closed by Aus
tria politely acceding to the American
view point and promising to make
amends. An indemnity will be prom
ised. A little later more Americans will
be sacrificed, and then tho whole farce
of note writing will be repeated.
WEBER CLUB FILLED
WIH GREAT CROWD
MERflY-MflKERS
"I've been floatipg down the old
Green river
On the good ship Rock and Rye
But I floated too far, I got stuck on
a bar,
I was out there alone wishing- that
I was home.
,The ship got wrecked with the cap-
tain and crew,
And there was only one thing left
i to do,
So I had to drink the whole Green
river dry
To get back home to you."
The above refrain, from "Down the
Old Green River," was the official
song last night at the New Year's
Eve celebration in the Weber club,
in which a large majority of the city's
social "400" and a number of promi
nent' society people from Salt Lake
and other outside cities participated.
The song held a top position in print
ed form, with several others, expres
sive of the carnival spirit, and was
sung in solo, quartette and chorus,
as the spirit prompted, during the
closing hours of the old year, which
the merry-makers occupied in the en
joyment of an elaborate supper.
The menu of the supper, which was
served by an augmented force of We
ber club dining room attaches, was
as follows:
Olympia Oyster Cocktail
, Puree of Green Pea in Tasse
Saltine Wafers
Caripo Ripe Olives Almond Nuts
Fillet of Sea Bass
' 'r Anchovis Butter Duchess Potato
Kaffir, Corn Fed Turkey,
Chestnut Dressing

whichompletely filled the main din
ing ro'6m, the private dining rooms
and otfier rooms specially arranged
for theVcasIon, being surrounded by
'the club m mbers, with their ladies
and friends, gaily bedecked wtih fa
vors of citnival type. Simultaneously.
a troupe pfc cabaret entertainers, spe
cially imported for the occasion be
gan their work to B&t the crowd in
ttfe. proper nfood. The songs and in
strumental numbers ,o the troupe
werp enthusiastically applauded and
after 10:30 o clock, were interspersed
with selections llSy the Orpheum the
atre orchestra.
Afofew minutes before midnight,
noiseinakers of -ffliinerous types were
distributed to thebanqueters and the
passing of ttio old?year was the signal
for thoir use.. For'nearly fifteen min
utes the greeting tothe New Year
prevailed and soon afterward, the
main dinjfl'g Toom vtka cleared and
dancing began, the music being fur
nished by the Orplieum orchestra.
This amusement completed the pro
grambf the nights and was enjoyed
