FEAR OF BREAK
SUBMARINE CAPTAIN
ALREADY PUNISHED
Official Communication on
Subject Now in Hands of
Secretary Lansing
Washington, D. C., Dec. 31.—The of
ficial text of Austria's Ancona note
was received early today at the state
department. Translating will take
several hours.
The reply came in sections. Sec
retary Lansing said that one section
had been translated and that he ex
pected the complete translation would
oe in his hands before night.
Officials who had read the unofficial
rersion of the reply received in press
Lspatches from London apparently
,-ere much gratified at its nature.
Danger of a.break of diplomatic rela
tions with Austria-Hungary was no
tongei considered imminent. Offici
als said, novover, that additional cor
respondence on u*e subject was sure
to ensue. Secretary LhncJnp- declined
to comment on the reply until h.» had
the complete oftyclal text.
If the official text of Austria's reply
to the second American note con
forms to press dispatches saying the
communication announced that the
submarine commander who torpedoed
the sjbaraejkhad been punished, vir
tually only on§ phase of the incident
remains to be ^tearedjjj.ir That^ «iuld
be the payment "of" Indemnity for
American lives lost, for which Austria
has expressed a willingness to make
reparation. Later, however, there
may be full exchanges between the
United States and Austria on the
question of submarine warfare and
the necessity for warning before at
tacking merchantmen.
it was pointed out here that in pub
lishing the submarine commander for
failure to take into account the panic
prevailing aboard the Ancona before
torpedoing the vessel, the Austria
government, in effect, disavowed the
act and gave assurances that there
would be no repetition of such an in
cident
Bernstorff Confers.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, called at the state de
partment and conferred with Secre
tary Lansing nearly half an hour.
The ambassador said he believed the
news summary of the note saying
Austria had punished the commander
cf the submarine which sank the An
cona and that the Vienna government
had offered indemnity for the loss of
life and injury of American citixens
was correct. He declined to com
ment on his visit.
Later, it was learned the German
view is that Austria-Hungary had
granted complete concessions to the
American demands.
VIENNA CONCILIATORY.
Berlin, Dec. 81.—The text of Aus
tria's note to the United States was
received in Berlin early this morning
at such an hour that the morning
newspapers were unable to comment
on it. The Lokal Anzeiger gives an
Indication of its views In a headline,
"Conciliatory Attitude of Vienna Gov
ernment."
BRITONS COMMENT.
London, Dec. 31.—The Austrian re
ply to the United States appears in
this afternoon's newspapers under
the heading "Austria Gives Way," or
similar words. The passages concern
ing punishment of the commander of
the submarine which sank the Ancona
and the indemnification of Americans
are featured in the headings, some of
which characterize Austria's state
ments in regard to the conduct of the
Ancona's crew as "impudent." The
early afternoon editions contain no
editorial comment

INTERNAL EXPLOSION CAUS­
ED THE DISASTER.
London, Dec. 31.—The British ar
mored cruiser Natal has sunk after
an explosion. Official announcement to
this effect was made here today.
The Natal was sunk yesterday af
ternoon while in harbor, as the result
of an internal explosion. There are
a^out 400 survivors.
The Natal sinking is the severest
loss which the British navy has sus
tained in several months. No British
naval vessels of importance had been
sunk since May when the Triumph
and. Majestic were torpedoed at the
Dardanelles. The Natal, although a
powerful man of war, was laid down
eleven years ago and her displacement
was only about one-half of the largest
British sea fighters.
In accordance with ita procedure of
late, the admiralty ha« given no indi
cation as to the locality of the Natal
disaster. The military regulations
make it Impossible to give this inform
ation publicly.
The loss Is generally attributed to
foul play.

AVIATORS ESCAPE
8WISS GENDARMES ARE OUT­
WITTED, FOX TERRIER PLAY­
ING PART IN SCHEME.
Geneve, Switzerland, Dec. 31.—Two
French aviators, Sergeant Georges
Madon and Corporal Rene Chatelain,
who were interned at Zurich, escaped
in a sensational manner to Evian, on
the French side of Lake Geneva.
They obtained permission to take a
walk, under guard of a soldier of the
Swiss landsturm named Wuest, in
the vicinity of the place where they
were Interned.
Accordingly they started out, ac
companied by a fox terrier which
later played a part in their escape. The
guard, not suspecting any ruse, led
them to a copse. There, according to
a prearranged^plan, Charles Beck, a
French territorial
Boldier
on sick leave,
whose acquaintance the aviators had
made, awaited in civilian clothes with
an automobile.
Wuest was stunned by a blow on
the head and was bound and bundled
into the car. The other Jumped in
after him and speeded to Ouchy on
Lake Geneva where they embarked in
an auto boat hired by Beck and sailed
off under the eyes of a Swiss gen
darme, who made no attempt to stop
them, the presence of the fox ter
rier leading him to believe that the
men in the boat were civilians.
•AVIATORS INTERNED.
Paris, Dec. 31.—A German aviation
lieutenant, accompanied by his me
chanic, deserted with an aeroplane,
says the Calais correspondent of the
Excelsior.
"They flew over the Dutch border,
being greeted by volleys from the
frontier guards, and landed at the
village of Aardenburg. They have
been interned at Flushing."

TOMORROW TO SEE
PROHIBITION RULE
Six Other States Join This
One in Going Totally,
Into Dry Column
Des Moines, Dec. 31.—''Bargain day
sales" in the 602 saloons of Iowa were
In progress today preparatory to the
final closing tonight. Tomorrow the
sU te will have joined the list of dry
states of the union, when the mulct
law repeal, passed by the last general
assembly becomes effective. Under
the act statutory prohibition is re
stored, pending the action of the next
legislature and the people on the pro
posed constitutional amendment for
prohibition, which 1b to be disposed
of within the next two years.
According to figures offered by the
Anti-Saloon league of America, the
addition of the seven states that go
dry tomorrow will bring the total of
prohibition states in the union to nine
teen.
In Iowa fifteen breweries were clos
ed down finally today, and tomorrow
between 2,000 and 2,600 bartenders
and employes of these breweries will
have lost their positions. City, coun
ty and federal governments will lose
an annual revenue of $765,550. The
breweries put out of business are cap
italized at nearly $5,000,000.
SIX JOIN IOWA.
Dec. 31.—State wide pro­
hibition of the sale and manufacture
oi inttwrirating liquors will become
effective states at midnight
tonight, putting odt^^huslness more
than 3.0QQ saloons, a larfct—r»u»ber of
breweries, wholesale liquor nouses
and distilleries.
The states which are to enter the
dry column are Iowa, Colorado, Ore
gon, Washington, Idaho, Arkansas and
South Carolina. Many counties in all
of the seven states have prohibited
the sale of liquor for a number of
years under local option laws.
Confusion Settled.
In Colorado district attorneys at a
recent meeting agreed that technical
ly Colorado's constitutional prohibi
tion amendment and the enforcing
statute do not become effective until
midnight January 1 but it was also
decided that the expiration of all
liquor licenses at midnight tonight
will render liquor sales on New Year's
day unlawful. According to one
authority between $2,000,000 and
$8,000,000 have been expended for
liquor in Colorado within the last
week.
Arkansas will have its first experi
ence with prohibition when the state
wide law, passed by the last legisla
ture, goes into effect with the coming
of the new year. The Arkansas de
partment of the Anti-Saloon league
has announced that the league will
have workers in the field to see that
the law is enforced. Anti-prohibition
leaders have announced that no fight
will be made for the repeal of the
law, at least until prohibition has
been given a thorough test.
Can't Even Make It
In Oregon the manufacture or sale
of any kind of intoxicating liquor is
absolutely prohibited by constitution
al amendment. Drug stores are no^
permitted to sell liquor for any pur
pose with or without a doctor's pre
scription. Each family may import
for personal use a maximum either of
two quarts of spirituous vinous liquors
or twenty-four quarts of male liquors
in any period of four consecutive
weeks. No person other than a com
mon carrier may make deliveries of
liquor, and the purchaser of liquor
illegally is made equally culpable with
the seller.
In the state of Washington the in
itiative prohibition law, ratified in
November, 1918, permits residents to
purchase from dealers outside the
state two quarts of spiritous liquor or
twelve quarts of beer each twenty
days.
Idaho will go dry tonight by virtue
of statutory prohibition. Most of the
state has been dry under local- option
and only about 150 saloons will be
forced out of business. Idaho's pro
hibition law was said to be the most
drastic in the union.
BOOZE PUT IN RIVER.
Charleston, W. Va., Dec. 31.—
Twenty-five thousand pints of whisky,
brandy and rum confiscated by the
state prohibition department were
emptied In a sewer here yesterday.
The process required three hours work
on the part of four men who worked
in relays In order to prevent being
overcome by the fumes. The depart
ment has'received a report from a
deputy stationed in a town on the
Kentucky border telling of the arrest
of ten alleged bootleggers, each of
whom wore from four to six pairs of
trousers and tyfo coats with many
small pottles of whisky In the pock

Public Meeting Planned for
This Week Will Not Be
Held Untf.1 Later
WANT TO DISCUSS
YOUTHFUL PROBLEMS
Object Is to Perfect Move
Toward Eliminating All
of the Delinquents
The public meeting planned for this
week to discuss juvenile work in Ot
tumwa and Wapello county will not
be held until some future date, yet
undecided.
This action was taken on the pro
posed session after it was found that
so many of the members of the com
mittee and others who would attend
were busy with other matters or
were ill and could not attend a gath
ering this week. Definite, organized,
well balanced juvenile work is the
proposition which the Associated
Charities office has undertaken with
the end In view of ultimately working
out some sort of a plan that will put
the matter on a clearly defined basis
for future action. It was the plan to
have a general meeting and to have
the district court judges, the police
judge, the justices of the peace, social
workers and all others in the city
who are interested to attend. Talks
would be made by all who have had
a definite understanding of this work
and its vast importance.
Juvenile work in Ottumwa and
other towns in the county has always
been handled as a part of the dis
trict court work. Whether there Is
sufficient ground here for the estab
lishment of a Juvenile officer, specially
trained for his work, or the maintain
ing of a Juvenile court to handle these
caseB alone, is the question which
would have
y^v
be determined later.
The aim of the promoters of this
meeting, when it is held, will be to
get the people together to
Btudy
con­
ditions here and to discuss the propo
sition of preventing general delin
quency and neglect among the chil
dren.
ITALIANS OCCUPY

Paris, Dec. 81.—The Journal's cor

a regiment to Durazzo. All these
I troops seem intended for garrison
duty and there i£ no sign that they
are preparing tovrarch toward Mace*
donia, although an effective blow
could be struck at.^he badly equipped
army \$iich could be taken
