BRINGING UP FATHER.'
j To wk-it difficulties a manager
can be put, when contemplating
a new production is easily illus

; Father, the new Gus Hill attrac
tio,i .' vb,c1 ' '« un<,e,,iü » fl U) ho,d
t he boards at E ks Theatre Mon
day, Jan. 10th. The new offering
is based on the successful aud
papular cartoons of the same ti
tie, and created by that giited ar
tist and huuiuiist George McMa
nus. The ultimate success of the
piay, which is described as a
dancing and singing comedy, de
pends on the proper kind of ac
tors to interpret the different
roles. Of course, competence
was esseut ial, Out the type had
to be considered; that is per
fotmers who met with the phys
ical requirements of the roles as
signed to them This w is indeed
a Knotty problem for the manage
ment and ar oue time it looked as
it the production would either
have to be postponed or probably
abandoned. For iustai ce, theie
are ten leading charade's on
whose work the plut revolves and
develops. They vary freui the
quite easy goiug Irishman, 'Jiggs
Mahoney', who is the father, and
whose family tries to bring him
up- Then there is another type,
'Jerry Sullivan', also an Irish
man, just the opposite of Jiggs,
but equally as good natured;
•Billy Magee', a flippant youth Of
about twenty four and given to
slang,'Tom H imil on', a likeable
young Irishman, with a decided
bloque Then there is 'Pierre
Castillion'a tall handsome man
of Spanish casie, very genteel
and suave, aud somew hat Ameii
canizeù; -Mrs. .Mahoney', a large
and impressive Itish womaD,
with a d.nuineeimg air, whose uh
ture assumes a complete change
as the play progresses; 'Eleanor
Mahoney', a bright friendly, tall
>nd gt aceful Ame» i'*au girl, Peg
y Mahoney' a br gilt little col
Of course there are a few othere, to
een of twenty, and in striking
contrast*to her sister Eleanor
who are equally as good. Hap
pily, ail of these types have be*n
-'eeured and they form a comb'ha
non. hard to equal. Laughter is

PERUNA
THE
RE
MOTOR GAR AND AUTO
IN COLLISION.
On Friday afternoon, Christ
mas eve, a party of young men
started from Bream Bridge for
Arnaudville. The boys, it seems,
more or less influenced by the
spirit of the season, turned what
was intended to be a pleasure
trip into a veritable "joy ride".
When about to cross the track of
the New Iberia & Northern K R ,
neat Arnaudville, they noticed the
approaching motor car. One ot
be "joy riders" was reported to
have exclaimed—"Let me take
(be wheel and I will show >ou
how to beat her to the crossing."
The auto did beat the motor to
the crossing, but the motor-car
p>ayed such a close second that
the auto failed to clear before
the arrival of the motor.
»
The auto was crumpled into a
tangle of wood andiron wreckage,
which was thrown some fifty feet
ahead of the motorcar, inio the
■ itch. The motorcar was de
railed, but otherwise umnjn ed.
The occupants of the aoto were
as follows; Jno. Hebert, who
was dead wheu picked up; Lamar
Broussard, who was taken to bis
home in Lafayette; D Dupqy
and Abdlen Lauerie were taken
to Breaux Bridge, where they
died of their injuries; and Robert
Angelle, whose injuries were
slight, was the only ODe of tbe
party who was able to give an ac
count of tbe happening

A FATAL ACCIDENT.
a
Willie Bouligny, son of
Louis Bouligny. an employee
of the Estorge Drug Co., whole
sale department, fell from a step I
ladder some two weeks ago. Ilej
landed amidst a number of latge
bottles and demijohns. A uutn
lier of the glass vtssels were
broken, resulting in inflicting se
vere wounds about the shoulder
aud arm By Christmas day in
flammation had set in iu an
alarming form. During that day
he died. His funeral took place
from St. Peters Catholic Church
on Sunday evening. He was
about 20 years of age. • We learn
that no one was near him when
the accident occurred. He had
evidently gone to the fop of the
shelving and had piobably lost
his balance in attempting to
shift his ladder
PNEUMONIA.
Pneumonia occurs everywhere,
in all climates, at all times of the
year, and at all ages. It is more
frequent iu the winter and early
spring It is often called the
disease of the old, but it is also
common in children. Pneumonia
is rho most prevalent and noost
fatal of ali acute diseases.
If is a f iequenI complication of
typhoid fever, influenza, Bi igkt's
disease and other debilitating af
fectiout. It is commonly brought
on by exposure to cold.
W e should think of pneumonia
vrry much as we thi*k of iutlueu
za or whooping coJgh as an iu
fectloa waich is thread from man
f mau through the secretions of
the mouth an*'the nose. Every
cafe should >e regarded a poiot
from which infection may be
spread.
Ever/ OI »e should know, that
loss ft sleep, overwork, worry,
p 00 ,or insufficient food, lack of
ex/roise, use of alcohol, colds or
^cesses of all kinds predispose
to pneumonia. Sleeping or woik
iug in an overheated, close room,
or sudden exposure may also pre
dispose to an attack.
To ward off this danger:
Sleep with open windows.
Ventilate the room where you
work.
Take some exercise iu the open
*ir every day.
