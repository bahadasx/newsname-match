(By Staff CorrMpontnt.)
J OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 21.
Stundput Democrats in the
house wlio had voted against the
registration law because of what they
considered unfair methods In the
process of registration, and tho czar
like power of the registration officer,
won out today when amendments
were put In the law eliminating most
of the object ionablo features. Then
they voted for the bill and placed
tho emergency on It, the emerKcncy
vote being B9 to 20. Tho vote re
vealed tho full Democratic strength.
Tho usury bill also was completed.
In the senate with a few amendments,
which were concurred in by the house,
and the usury bill ijso was passed
finally. Thus ended what promised
to be a deadlock that might have
tuken days to break.
. The amendments to the registration
law were not pleasant In some respects
to the members of the senate, but
were adopted with verbal protest, and
the bill finally received the unani
mous vote of the senate, with tho
exception of Senators Watrous, Re
publican, and Wilson of Dewey, So
cialist. Governor Takes a Hand.
Tho amendments were proposed
after Governor Williams made a visit
to tho legislative halls this afternoon
and talked with members of the
house. One provides that nil voters
who are qualified nnd did vote nt
the election of November, 1914, would
be permitted to vote without regis
tration under the plan proposed by
the new law, and that precinct lists
jot the voters would be conclusive evi
dence of the qualification of the
voter as to registration. This
would relieve such voters from regis
tering again. It also Is provided that
any person claiming to be a qualified
voter who is refused registration by
the registrar may go Into court and
seek mandamus uetion to compel the
registering officer to register the
voter. This may be taken to tho dis
trict court and finally to the supreme
court. Another amendment exempts
the registration from purely school
district elections. I'reparations bad
been made to bring in ull the mem
bers, even to bringing Representative
Rollins from tho hospital, where ho
has smallpox. Caucuses were held
several times today by tho house
leaders, but It was finally seen that It
ti-milft lio ImiwmMlhlo to not tho
emergency rcuimrniion km i inrnugii
unless some concessions were made to
those Democrats who had stood out
against the measure on account of the
arbitrary power It conferred upon
registration officers.
I'oroe a Compromise.
After a caucus held this afternoon,
In which the situation was made plain,
the amendments explained were of
fered as drafted by a number of the
house leaders. When they were, dis
cussed the stand pat Democrats wero
shown that the radicals admitted they
wero defeated, then the truce won de
clared. It was not until this that
tho 14 conservatives, who believed
that the amendments eliminated prac
tically all of their sole objections,
ugrecd to vote for the emergency.

DECLARES DEATHS
DUE TO NEGLIGENCE
Several Lost laves When
Forced to Fly in broken
Down Machine.
ASIIINGTO.V, Feb. 21. The
senate military committee voted
today to recommend an Investigation
of the army aviation service by con
gress. Tho decision was reached ufter
Senator Robinson, who had Intro
duced a resolution for such an Inves
tigation, submitted further evldonce
to support his charges of general In
efficiency. Senator Robinson produced before
tho committee last week photogruphlo
copies of letters alleged to have
passed between Lieut. Col. Samuel
Reber, head of the aviation service,
and Capt. Arthur H. Cowan, in charge
of tho Kan Diego stutlon, which the
senator sald revealed thut the serv
Ico was "contemptibly Inefficient." In
his supplementary statement today
ho declared that of about 24 officers
who hud qualified as fliors, 15 had
been killed, several losing their lives
because "they were required to at
tempt flights n antlquuted biplanes
known to be defective. '
An Inquiry Into the aviation serv
ice, which will proceed Independent
of congressional action, nlready has
been ordered by the wur department.
Only Twenty-four Filers.
"Tho Inefficiency and unsatisfac
tory results of the present manage
ment of the aviation section," said
Senator Robinson in bis statement to
tho committee today, "is disclosed by
tho fact that during eight years, or
about thut, In which tho signal corps
has had control of aviation, only about
24 qualified fliers with the military
rating have been produced. While
tho statement wus made before tho
house committee on military uffulrs
that there aro now 46 officers who
are qualified as fliers and who are
attached to tho aviation section, I be
lieve that an investigation will dis
close that (hero are only about 24.
"Very few of the so-called 'quali
fied fliers' havo ever done military
work or even seen from an aero
plane n field gun fired. Only ono or
two have maneuvered In aeroplanes
with bombs attached to It for use.
Tho service has no bombs, no bomb
sighting device, no method of mount
ing a gun on an aeroplane, nor has
a gun ever boon fired from an aero
plane. We have no armored aero
planes and the machines on hand
are not efficient enough for flying
duty.
SMy-five Percent Killed.
"During tho eight years ubovo re
ferred to, which have netted only
about 21 qualified fliers, there have
occurred 17 deaths In connection vviLh
military aviation, 15 officers having;
been killed. The other two cases
embrace the death of ono soldier and
ono civilian. Tims approximately B5
per cent as many officers have been
killed as there aro now officer-pilots
on aviallon duty, v
"Of the above mentioned 15 offi
cers who have been killed, eight of
them have died in flights at the
North Island station near San Diego.
"Six of these aviators were killed
within ten in out lis, and it Is believed
that an Investigation will disclose that
their deaths were duo to the fact that
they were required to uttempt flights
In antiquated biplanes, known to be
defective and dangerous. Following
tho death of Lieut. 11. It. post in 1S14
four of these machines were burned.
It is believed an Investigation will
disclose that other Injuries were duo
to the use of unsafe machines ami
that in some cases, where warnings
bad been given that the machines
wero unsafe, officers who were re
quired to fly in them were, in .some
instances, injured, und others killed.
Ilciiflicy lroUitcd.
"It Is a well-known fact that a
short time before Lincoln Itcachey
was killed he visited this station nnd
pronounced it outrageously defective
in equipment and management, and
that lie communicated his opinion in
a bitter protest which camu to the
knowledge of the wur department.
"The First company, Second aero
squadron, now in the Philippines,
prior to February I, 1910, had no
aeroplanes. 1 urn Informed rhat four
have been ordered and that two have
teen or will soon be shipped. The
First company, Second Aero squad
ron In the Philippines consists of six
officer-pilots. There are no other
field orguniKations. There are two
qualified officer-pilots Instructing
students nt the aviation school und
two are studying aeronautics in Hus
ton. "The dangers connected with avia
tion at this stage of Its development
when surrounded by every safeguard
which mechanical skill and scientific
knowledge and due precaution can
secure, are so great that only the
ambitious und daring are prompted
to undertake to master it. I will not
uso words to characterize a system as
that prcvnillng In our service, where
incompetence and Indifference have
milled to the dangers Inherent In avia
tion through nn unskillful iinvnien-
' tiflc, negligent and corrupt control."
