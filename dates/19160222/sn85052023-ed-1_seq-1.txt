HELM PUSHING PUBLIC BUILDINGS BILL
Congressman Thinks Stanford Has Fine Chance
Friends Say He Should Be Renominated.
Congressman Harvey Helm is here
for a few days' stay at his old home
and is being given the glad hand by
his many friends and admirers. The
I. J.'s first question propounded to
Representative Helm was, "What
about the government building for
Stanford?" His reply was:
"It is a near possibility. These
appropriations for government build
ings go in groups and there is a
strong sentiment in the House for
an Omnibus bill of moderate propor
tions. If such a bill can be gotten
through there will be no doubt about
the Stanford proposition for when it
passes the House there will be no
more tremble; the Senate being cer
tain to sustain the Lower Branch. I
would suggest that the Stanford peo
ple, together with the Chamber of
Commerce, get busy and get the peo
ple in Lincoln county interested in
the matter. It would be a good idea
also to lay before the Congressional
Committee some of the advantages
Stanford has. A booklet, giving pic
tures of the court house and other
prominent buildings here and ,a thor
ough description of town and county
might be of inestimable benefit in
can-ying through the undertaking.
The good people of Lincoln county
can rest assured that I will leave no
stone unturned in my effort to get a
public building foi- my home town
and anything else I may be able to
do for it."
"What about preparedness?" ask
ed the I. J. representative. Mr.
Helm said: "Preparedness has the
country in its grip. It is overshad
owing everything in the House. It
has really come to be a political foot
hall, the republicans endeavoring to
make political capital of it instead
of treating it in a patriotic, non-partisan
manner, as the democrats are
doing. The republicans, msteaa ot
- .yjrassistingthe-PEesident, in avoidio
entanglements in the European mael
strom, are doing all in their power to
complicate matters for their gain.
He arraigns Wilson's administration
for its failure to invade Germany
-when Germany invaded Belgium and
indicts the present administration
for its failure to intervene in Mex
ico, when certain adventurous dare
devils and get-rich-quick schemers
are taking long chances on Mexico's
concessions. In other words, Teddy
would have the United States in war
both in Europe and in Mexico. And
strange as it may seem that, notwith
standing this un-American spirit, he
is the idol of the opposition to the ad
ministration which is using every ef
fort to keep the country out of war.
In fine, Roosevelt is for war and
Wilson is for peace."
Mr. Helm's friends say that at the
proper time he will announce his can
didacy for re-election. His friends
all over the district are declaring
that the present is not the time to
talk of changing the Eighth's repre
sentative in congress, and assert that
the democrats in congress, like Mr.
Helm, who are standing as loyally by
President Wilson and his policies
should be renominated as the Presi
dent -will be, without a contest. A
recent issue of the Nicholasville
News voiced this sentiment most
pungently when it had the following
to say: g
The Democratic vote in Kentucky
has gotten to be of such a narrow
margin, that the thinking Democrats
who really love their party principles
are not going to drop in behind ev
ery man who announces himself for
office. There are many serious prob
lems to consider. This is not only a
presidential year, but a time when
eleven congressmen are to be elect
ed. President Wilson will undoubt
edly be the nominee for president,
and it behooves the Democratic lead
ers in this State to think more se
riously than they ever have.
The Republicans throughout Ken
tucky have a better organization
than for years and are very hopeful
-this fall of gaining a few congress
men. At Frankfort one can see the
leaders of the Republican party in
the Third House on the ground daily,
formulating plans for the future. Al
ready they are claiming that there is
a chance for them to carry the
Eighth Congressional District, if
they can only get Harvey Helm out
of the way and consequently are urg
ing Democrats in other counties to
make the fights la the State race
last November, the Eighth Congres
sional District gave a Democratic
majority of only 481. Harvey Helm's
majority over his Republican oppo
nents has never been less than 1,700
and once reached over 3,500.
Now the serious question comes,
is this the time to make a Democrat
ic fight in this congressional district?
The News believes with the strong
ticket the Republicans will offer this
fall, both National and State, that it
behooves the Democratic party to se
lect men who can make the best fight
for the party and put Kentucky
back in the strong Democratic col
umn where it belonged in other
years. It is the desire of President
Wilson for the Democrats to nomi
nate men in every district of Ken
tucky who can help him to carry the
State.
Congressman Helm has proven
his strength in the past and will do
so again, for at this time there is
not a man whom his opponents can
pit against him in the Eighth dis
trict that can defeat him for the
nomination and in November he will
run away from any man the Repub
licans may nominate. Mr. Helm has
always been allied with the interests
of the temperance people, and this
district certainly belongs in that col
umn, as J. C. W. Beckham defeated
Willson for United States Senator in
November 1914, by 3,587 majority
in the Eighth congressional district.
These are some figures the Demo
crats must think over.
HORSE SALES AT LEXINGTON
Local Animals Bring Satisfactory
Prices Under Hammer
Local horsemen realized satisfac
tory prices for the animals they of
fered for sale at the Lexington horse
sales last week. Bob Moreland, of
Lexington, formerly of Stanford,
paid the highest price of the sale
for a three-gaited mare named
Madge Nichols, which was consigned
to the sale by L. L. Wells, of Cave
City. Mr. Moreland, paid $1,475 for
gJierard bejieyesjie ihas a great show
prospect irr Kerr The s"econd Tiighest
price of the sale was brought by the
mare Queen Rosa, owned jointly by
W. B. Burton, of Lancaster, and
Commissioner of Agriculture Mat S.
Cohen, of Frankfort. She is the win
ner of 18 blue ribbons and was pur
chased by H. W. McGee, of Wheel
ing, W. Va., for 725. Clara L., an
other show ring winner, went to W.
P. White, of Augusta, Ga., for $560.
This mare was shown at the Stan
ford fair by Bernard Hays, of Nich
olasville, and was the pioperty of J.
S. Lowry, of Wilmore.
The bob-tailed mare, consigned by
J. C. Bailey, of this city, and which
was entered in the sale as Anna B.,
br m 8 years old by Dorsey Golddust,

WANTS A STANFORD FAIR
Edgar Doty, of Richmond", who
had a good string of horses at the K.
of P. fair here last year, was in the
city Saturday. He says he very
much hopes that, Stanford will have
a fair this year and that he has some
bread-winners that will make the
boys go some. "Your fair last year
would have been one of the very best
in Central Kentucky had not. the
weather behaved so badly an(lI hope
you will pick a better time this year,"
he said to an officer of the old as
sociation. It is very certain that the
Knights of Pythias will have another
fair, and that a strong effort will be
made to make it the biggest and best
yet.
BAD FIRE .IN LAUREL.
Local friends of William Hudson,
who has a large furniture store in
Bond, Laurel county, will regret to
hear that the store and contents were
destroyed by fire last week. Four
residences in Bond, the Hudson fur
niture store, a barber shop and the
Junior hall were burned, entailing a
loss of $20,000, which was only part
ly covered by insurance. But for
the good work of the bucket brigade
the fire would have destroyed other
large stores.
EXPLOSIVES FOUND ON R. R.
Lead to Belief Plan Was Made to
Blow Up Something.
The discovery of a large quantity
of high explosives and the peculiar
actions of two individuals, said to be
foreigners, lead railrond. officials to
believe that an attempt to blow up
the L. & N. tracks and wreck the
plant of the Standard Oil Company,
between Junction City and Shelby
City, was planned. These explosives
were discovered a few night ago un
der the telephone booth used by rail
road men adjacent to the big dis
tributing plant of the Standard Oil
Company. The night following the
discovery of. the explosives two men
approached the booth about mid
night,' but evidently realizing tha't
they were being watched, after stop
ping and holding a brief conference,
continued on their way down the
track toward Junction City. Officers
and railroad detectives who were
Watching the spot did not make
themselves known, hoping the men
would return. There were twenty
one fuses with" dynamite caps at
tached ready for use and the officers
believe that a destruction of proper
ty on a big scale was planned.
MAJORITY VOTE IS SUFFICIENT
To Vote Road Bonds, Says Appellate
Court Pulaski Is Affected.
Road bonds voted by counties of
Kentucky, which ainpunt to over two
million and a half dollars were made
valid by a decision of the Court of
Appeals last week which held that a
majority vote and not a two-thirds
majority is necessary to carry a
bond 'election. In the list of coun
ties whose road bond elections be
at comes valid, is Pulaski which voted
$300,000 road bonds by a majority
vote. i
Referring to Section 157-A of the
Constitution, permitting countiesto
vote road bond issues not in excess
of 5 per cent, of the total property
assessment, and Section 4307, Ken
tucky Statutes, Judge Hurt said:
i'Naither the Constitutional prtU3,
sion norlhe statute adopted to carry
i- .flr-.i. :a ..:: .,:.,,
into effect its provisions, requires
more 'than a majority of those vot
ing at the election to give their as
sent in order to authorize the indebt
edness to be incurred." Section 157
of the Constitution, amended in 1909
required two-thirds of those voting
to carry the proposition, but the road
bond amendment say's nothing about
tha mninrif-.v nerfissarv. This Ques
tion was not raised in the Fayette
case of $300,000 bonds which were
' in issue too, as the bonds had more
'than two-thirds of the votes cast,
'but the contention was made that
two thirds of all the voters of the
county did not vote for it. After
passing upon this point, Judge Hurt
went further and said a mere major
ity is sufficient.
None of the counties in which
bond issues carried but failed of a
two-thirds vote, have brought the
question squarely before the court,
and in some of them officials, believ
ing the election lost, have done noth
ing for several months towards issu-j
jing the bonds, while Pulaski has
voted $300,000 bond issues three
j times, but the 5 per cent limit, of
course, will prevent the county issu
ing $900,000 in road bonds.
All these counties have held elec
tions within a year: Boyd voted
$500,000; Mason, Pulaski and Hop
kins, $300,000; Daviess, $600,000;
Kenton, $250,000; Campbell, $200,
000; Oldham and Meade, $100,000; j lard, H. D. Aldridge, Bud Haggard,
Menifee, Trigg and Laurel, $50,000;, W. G. Withers, R. H. Bronaugh, Geo.
and Bracken, $40,000. j L. Bradley, W. S. Embry, and Geo.
Besides these Ballard and Fayette ' D. Boone,
have voted $300,000 by two-thirds j An order was entered by Judge
vote, Lewis and Breathitt, $150,000; , Hardin reappointing Eph D. Pen
Greenup and Knox, $200,000; Bell, j nington as Master Commissioner of
Whitley and Harlan, $250,000; the Lincoln Circuit court, and bond
Rockcastle, Scott and Laurel, $100,- i for $5,000, the requisite amount was
000; Nicholas, $125,000; Clinton, filed by Mr. Pennington with the
$40,000, and Russell and Carroll, J American Surety Company on the
$50,000; Christian, Unjon, Powell, ( bond. Mr. Pennington has made a

CIRCUIT COURT
GETS TO WORK
Judge Hardin Delivers Strong Charge
To Grand Jury and Juries Get
Busy Quickly.
Owing to an unavoidable delay,
Judge C. A. Hardin and Common
wealth's Attorney E. V. Puryear did
not arrive until 11 o'clock Monday
morning and the February term of
the Lincoln Circuit Court began op
erations an hour or so late. The
grand jury was quickly impannelled,
however, and Judge Hardin delivered
a strong but very brief charge be
fore noon. He first explained the
seriousness of the oath taken by
each member of the jury and stated
that good men were wanted as jury
men because they had the welfare of
the community at heart and would
do their UtmOSt tO See that those"'
guilty of infractions of the law were
brought to an account. "You are or
ganized to fight crime and to see
that the laws of your State are up
held, and it is your duty to inquire
into all of the violations of the law.
It costs Kentucky an immense sum
to -prosecute violators of the law and
you should and must do all in your
power to make the returns good for
the expenditure of money. Not on
ly inquire into murder cases but
turn the light on wherever you hear
that the law has been disregarded
and trampled under foot," said he
in as impressive manner as he could
command. Particular stress was laid
on the illegalsale of whisky and nar
cotics, gambling and bawdy houses.
He told of the evil influences of these
and insisted that it be the aim of
each member of the grand jury "to
better the conditions of the commu
nity and for society," he said. The
intention of the law is to make it
easy to do right and hard to do
wrong, he reminded the twelve gen
tlemen before him and he hoped they
would do much to make the pathway
of the law-abiding citizen easy and
that of the bad one hard.
Judge Harfiu was especially
slronc on the nistol ,:eoter." whom he
characterized as a cow2vHetold

?n Knnooalail n flAJlfllv WfifinOTI and I i n j 11 1 -in
ing concealed a deadly weapon and
the baneful influence of the person
who indulged in the pernicious habit.
He insisted that if there te those
guilty of dynamiting fish or seining
for them that they be apprehended
and punished to the full extent of
the law. "Fish and game are valu-
'able assets to Kentucky and the per
son who knowingly destroys eitner,
save for the right purpose, should be
made to pay dearly for it," said he
Judge Hardin had to curtail his
charge because of lack of time, but
what he said was to the point and
it seemed to impress those he was
addressing, while the crowd that had
gathered gave rapt attention and
drank in his every word.
Following is a list, of those who
compose the jury for the present
term: William Landgraf, W. J. Kin
ney, L. D. Gooch, J. W. Huston, E.
P. Manuel, W. J. Duncan, James Mc
Cormack, James M. Harris, G. J.
Austin, J. S. Duke, P. M. Condor,
Everett Carson. Mr. Harris was made
foreman and Mr. Carson, clerk.
The petit juries are composed of
the following gentlemen: James H.
Woods, H. C. Anderson, J. P. Chan
cellor, J. H. Wright, Lilburn Gooch,
Henry Kitts, J. A. Marining, C. B.
McGuffey, J. H. Livingston, W. L.

Master Commissioner under Judge
Hardin and the friends of both are
congratulating them upon the re
appointment. Greenie Hansford, a local negro,
who has spent some time in federal
prisons for bootlegging, was
fined
ing, and Milton Powell, of this city,
who alleged that Engleman attacked
him, was fined $5 and costs. A bunch
of young fellows of the Milledgeville

WILL PUT ON BIG LOT SALE
Real Estate Co. Buys Fine Tract On
Lancaster Street from Embrys
Embry Bros, sold over the phone
Monday night to Leonard Walton &
Co., of Glasgow, 30 acres of land on
Lancaster street, fronting the homes
of W. S. Fish and Mrs. Laura Hund
ley, for $6,000. One of the firm was
here Monday in consultation with
Sam J. Embry and he made him an
offer of $5,500. Mr. Embry stood
pat on $6,000 and last" night at a late
hour the deal was made.
The purchasers will plat the land
in five-acre farms and building lots
and in a week or so will offer them
for sale at auction. Mr. Walton told
the I. J. Monday that in the event he
and the Embrys made a deal, that

in this paper to tell of the sale he
would put on. Said he: "I believe
in newspaper advertising and find it
more satisfactory and profitable than
scattering bills broadcast. It is rea
sonable that people will read what is
in their home paper, but in winter it
is hardly probable that they will pay
much attention to bills tacked on
trees and in other public places."
Mr. Walton's argument is good.
Watch for his advertisement. Several
years ago his firm held a sale for W.
B. Land in Stanford and their work
was most satisfactory. -The Embry
Bros., made a good speck on the deal
and the sale means the placing on
the market of some splendid build
ing lots," something Stanford sadly
needs.

AUTO ACCIDENT
PROVES FATAL?
Thomas J. Oaks Dies at His Home
After Lingering Month Served
In the Union Army.
After lingering for about a month
after the a-ati-mobil- . accident in
which he was fatally injured, Thomas
J. Oaks died at his home on Darst
street, just east of Stanford, at nine
o'clock Sunday night. Everything
that medical science and faithful
and careful nursing could do, was
done for him, but his advanced age,
made recovery from the serious in
juries sustained extremely doubtful
at all times, and tired nature at last
gave up the struggle. Mr. Oaks was
76 yeai's ofage the day before his
death. Up until a few years ago he
had been a splendid specimen of
manhood, but his eyesight and hear
ing became impaired, a few years
ago, and such infirmities proved di
rectly responsible for his being in
jured in the accident which had such
an unfortunate result.
Mr. Oaks was born in Russell
county but had lived in Lincoln for
about 50 years, ever since his mar
riage. On the 4th day of January,
just a few days before the accident,
he and Mrs. Oaks celebrated the 50th
anniversary of their marriage, their
Golden Wedding. Mrs. Oaks was, be
fore her marriage, Miss Elizabeth
Vanhook. Mr. Oaks enlisted in the
union army, and served with honor
through the civil war, and had since
drawn a pension from the govern
ment. He belonged to the G. A. R.,
and was almost a life-long member
of the Methodist church. After the
war he became a farmer, and devot
ed most of his life thereafter to
that honorable pursuit- He was es
teemed and respected by all who
knew him, and many friends will
mourn that he is no more. Besides
Mrs. Oaks, he is survived by 10 chil
dren, all of whom were with their
father when the final summons came.
They are Mrs. Jennie Perkins, of
Bedford, Ind., Mrs. Fannie Peck, o
Granville, Ind., Ben Oaks and John,
Oaks,, of Lancaster, Mrs. T. E. Cecil,
ofT-Tarrard county, Mis. J ameSltte T-e-dith,
of Brodhead; Wm. Oaks, of
Garrard, Ed Oaks, of this city, Mrs.
C. C. Wilson, of Paris and Mrs. Ar
thur Young, of Lancaster. One child
is dead. There are also 46 living
grandchildren, seven dead, and nine
living great-grandchildren, two hav
ing died.
Funeral services were conducted
by his pastor, Rev. W. D. Welburn,
at the Methodist church Tuesday
morning at 11 o'clock, after which
the mortal remains were laid to their
final resting place ii. iiuffalpSprings
Cemetery.
MURDER CASES TO WHITLEY.
Attorney Herbert Reynolds, of
Eubank, who attended circuit court
at Somerset last week, spent several
days in Stanford the latter part of
the week with Sunt. G. Singleton and
family. Mr. Reynolds says that the
case of Taylor, charged with killing
Summer, was called last week but
Judge Bethurum, refused to sit in
the case and the Governor appointed
Judge Marshall as special judge. The
Commonwealth asked for a change
of venue and arguments were heard
by Judge Marshall on the motion,
and he granted the change. The
case will be tried in Whitley county,
at Williamsburg. The killing took
place during the political campaign
between Judge Bethurum and Judge
Kennedy for the Republican "nomi
nation for Judge, and only a few
days before the election. The shoot
ing took place while Judge Bethurum
was speaking. The Commonwealth
has more than 100 witnesses. The
trial began Monday.
TRIMBLE SALEM
Their many friends were surprised
at the announcement of the marriage
of Miss Gertrude Trimble and Chas.
Salem, which was solemnized by Rev.
P. L. Bruce Saturday evening. The
bride is the attractive daughter of
W. M. Trimble, and .20 years of age
while the groom is the well known
junior member of the firm of Salem
& Salem, proprietors of The Bargai.i
Store, and 24 years of age. They
have the best wishes and congratula
tions of many friends.
Do You Find Fault With Everybody?
An irritable, fault-finding disposi
tion is often due to a disordered
