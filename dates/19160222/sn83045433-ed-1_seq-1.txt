l'ndter pressure to "speed up" pre

Affairs Committee yesterday completed
the first draft of the land defense bill.
It provides:
An Increase in the regular army to
117,0.0 men, with 7,000 officers in a skele

could be expanded to 015,000.
A reserve made up of honorably dis

of a special cadet corps evolved through
military educational institutions.
The federalization of the militia, with
power lodged in the President to draft
it for war purposes and authority in the
Secretary of War to supervise the selec
tion of militia officers. The militia
would be given Federal power.
The increase of the facilities at West
Point to double its capacity, with an
immediate appropriation of s3i0,000 to
provide accommodations for additional

Special to Its Washingt herald,
London, Feb. '1.-Credits amounting to
43,000,000 pounds or 12,100,000,0 to carry
on the war, were voted by the house of
commons this evening.
This is the biggest vote of credit ever
made in the history of the house of com
mons and brings the total amount voted
for the war up to $2,013,000,000 pounds
sterling.
The credit is in two parts, the main
sum being & ,000,000 pounds and the resi
due 120,000,000 pounds, a supplementary
credit
In the course of the general debate
which preceded the vote, Sir Joseph Wal
ton urged the prohibition of needless
imports.
"Care should be taken," he said, "not
to get munitions from the United States.
Of twenty-eight shells fired from one
Howitzer only four burst."
1,420,000,000 Pouads Spent.
Premier Asquith, in moving the vote
of credit, announced that !ngland's total
expenditures for 1915-16 to date were 1,420,
000,000 pounds. Munitions for the army
and navy from April 1 last to February 13,
have cost 843,800,000 pounds sterling or
$4,174,0000.
Mr. Asqutth a that t al
lies of G - i ntis'do
minions had shown a substantial increase
since November, and the growth In the
rate of expenditure was entirely due to
loans to allies from the voted credits.

The premier added that the vote of
credit for the remainder of the financial
year ellowed an ample margin for con
tingencies, such as the purchase of Amer

periods:
April 1 to July 17, $14.000,000.
July 18 to September I11, $17,500.000.
September 12 to November 6, $1,740,000,
November 7 to February 19, $22,000.000.
A daily expenditure henceforth of five
million pounds ($5,000.000) would be a
liberal estimate. Mr. Asquith said. The
treasury still had on hand 102,000,00(
pounds sterling to carry it on to March
