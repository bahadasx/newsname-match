Democrats On The Question
Defense Revenues
Will Also lax inheritance And Levy
On War Monitions
Washington, Fob. 21. The incroas- J
ofl revenues necessary for carrying i
out the administration's preparedness '
program will bo chiefly awlved by
changes in the income tax law and a
levy ou wur munitions.
Tills is indicated by a poll that has
been made of the ways and means
committee of the houso, which orig
inates all rorcnue legislation. A ma
jority of that committee, including
nearly ull the Democrats, favor rely
ing mobtly ou the Income tax for nec
essary leveuuos, and a majority also
are disposed to levy a tax in some
form upon war munitions. Thoro is
also sentiment in the committee favoring-
an Inheritance) tax.
A' notable feature of tiie poll is that
thero is no sentiment in favor of a
tax on ,' asoiine, a general levy on
fabricated iron and steel or other
Items suggested by the administra
tion. While thp Democratic party in con
press, as evidenced by the ways and
moans committee, is intent upon mak
ing those with incomes bear tho chief
burden of the national defense ex
penditures, it Is apparent the plans
of sonic of the leaders to tap this
eourco exclusively will be stubbornly
opposed. It la evident, too, that thero
will be strong opposition within tho
Democratic party to any plan which
contemplates merely n boosting of the
surtax rales as applied to incomes ,
oror $10,000 a year. Influential Dem- '
ocrats will insist upon a lowering of
the present income tax exemptions, so
m to make the application of the tax
more general.
Tho polls show that many members
of the ways and means committee
tor or reducing tho exemptions as well
as raising the surtaxes. The New
York delegation In congress will have
to bo reckoned with on this subject.
The poll of all tho mombers of that
delegation who wore in Washington
showed Uiat they are practically unan

imous in oi.poF.iim further increases
in the income tax unless there is a
lowering of thcJ exemptions and a
more equitable distribution of the bur
den. New York stale last year paid more
than $17,000,000 in income taxes, near
Ij half of the total amount turned
into the treasury from this source. At
tho same time the state contributed
more than $10,000,000, or one quarter
of the yield, from the corporation tax.
The Republican members of the
irvs and means committee believe
that national derense revenues should
Ijp raised by nn upward revision of the
tariff. As the Democrats will not as
pent to this, the Hepublicans will bo
cbliged to take their choice from
changes In tho income tax, a tax on
war munitions and an inheritance tax.
Some of the Republicans will support
program of taxation containing one
or more of these features.
Representative Kltchin, tho Demo
cratic leader and chairman of the
nays and means committee, believes
Hip only practical way of raising tho
money for defense is by changes In
the income tax law.

GREY BLAMES GERMANS
American Plan of Aiding Belgium to
Feed Herself Falls.
Loudon, Feb, 21. Tho plan of aid
ing Belgium to feed herself by re
habilitating the Industries of tho
country undor control of the Ameri
can commission for relief In Belgium
has failed, according to a letter writ
ten by Sir Edward Grey, tho British
lorelgn secretary, to M. Hymans. the
Belgian minister here, because tho
Germans thus far have failed to reply
to the request for guarantees that raw
materials and manufactured goods
will not bo seized by the occupying
armies.
The American roliof commUsion
tome time ago proposed that certain
kinds of noncontraband raw materials
should bo permitted to pass through
tho Btltish blockado into Bolijium,
goods manufactured from them lo bo
re-otported. It was proposed that tho
balance of trade thus created in favor
ot Belgium should ho invosted In food,
thus putting tho population, as far as
possible, upon u Belt-supporting nasis
and at tho same time chocking tho
growing demoralization, due to long
unemployment.

Get Together.
WAGE QUESTION IS MEN UP
Miners of the Hard Coal District Seek

Recognition of Their Union Bitu
minous Miners and Operators Also
to Meet This Veek What the
Operators Say.
New York, Fob. 21. Representa
tives of the United Mine Workers of
Arrorica and of tho coal mine oper
ators met In convention at the Hotel
McAlpin today to try and reach an
agreement by which they can go on
amicably working together after
March 31, when the agreement now
existing will expire.
During the first part of the week
the anthracite miners and operators
will endeavor to conclude their busi
ness. Beginning Thursday the bitu
mlnus miners and operators, who
have been holding a convention in
I Mobile without success, will continue
1 their efforts towards an understand
! lng here.
The miners are asking an eight
i hour day, recognition of their union,
and in the case of the anthracite work-
Ihe bituminous workers are seeking
a 10 per cent increase. There are
other Issues at stake, but they are ot
minor importance.
John P. White, president of the
United Mine Workers, who establish
ed headquarters here, issued a state
ment covering the demands of the
miners and explaining why increased
wages are essential to their existence
He was not hopeful that the operators
will agree to the demands already
drawn up, but he does believe that an
ultimate compromise can be reported.
The operators have signified in a
recent publicity campaign that it will
Lo impossible for them to grant the
two chief demands, namely higher
wages and shorter hours, without in
creasing the retail price of coal con
siderably. Already they have inform
ally refused to grant the demands.
Despite the fact that there Is likely
to be something of a deadlock from
the very beginning of the conference,
Mr. White does not think that a gen
eral strike will have to be called. He
explains that the union has adopted a
ronsuspension policy, which means
that so long as there is hope of a set
tlement a general strike will not be
crdered.
"Conditions in the anthracite field
have grown worse instead of better,
because the cost of living has gone
up faster than wages," said Mr.
White. "The averase anthracite mine
worker pets far less than enough to
support his family dcently. Since
1902 wages have Increased 3.6 per
cent. The cost of food since that j car
has increased 17 per cent, according
to tho United States bureau of labor
statistics. Between 1903 and 19K the
wholesale price of clothing increased
33 per cent, according to the samn
authority."

London, Feb 21 England's east
and southwest cocsts were visited in
broad daylight Sunday by four Ger
man seaplanes, presumably of the lat

ties was only three two men and
one boy killed, and one man, a ma
rine, injured. Manj bombs were drop
red. The damage as ofUcially report
ed was confined chiefly to private
property.
A feature of the official account is
tho frank admission that British air
craft, one naval plane and two aero
planes, which ascended to attack the
raiders, failed to reach them. It ap
pears the German planes are capable
of ascending to an extraordinary

Tho wnr office states that two bi
planes., after circling over the town,
of LowestofL In Kent "rose to a
great height and seemingly vanished."
Fifteen minutes later they reappeared
over the town and then flew to the
east
At Lowestoft it develops only three
bombs hit buildings. Others fell on
waste ground, into gardens, on the
reach and into the sea, none ot them
doing any damage of military import

Tho Germans have been operating
along the Yser canal In Belgium, to
the north of Ypres. From the British
350 meters of position were captured
and held, despite hand grenade at

bombardment the Germans attempted

Moving Against Avlona.
That progress lb being made by the
Teutonic allies in the direction of
Avlona seemingly is shown by the re

of Berat, situated about thirty-one
miles northeast of Avlona.
The Russian army which captured

to cut off the retreat of the Turks,
