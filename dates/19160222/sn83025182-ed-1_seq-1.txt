BERLIN, Feb. 22.—Nowhere in Ber
lin is tsbore evident the slightest de
giro to withhold Germany's new sub
marine warfare because of protests
from the United States.
The general feeling is that Ameri
cans must suffer the consequences If
they embark on belligerent merchant
men carrying arms after March 1. The
patient attitude toward America dis
played during the Luaitania negotia»
tlons, It is plain today, no longer ex
ists because of the popular feeHng
that America already has hindered so
many of Germany's plans.
The Berlin newspapers have carried
BO discus&ion for two days on Amer
ica's ~c\'~'ide toward Germany's new
ctmpaU,.. against armed merchant
men. It is generally known, how
ever. that with tfyje inauguration of the
new warfare onlfe eight days distant,
the difficulties botween the two coun
tries have not brien solved. In some
quarters it Is bewleved a satisfactory
settlement will jbe reached in others
the greatest peqsimism prevails. The

said they had not heard of any passen
gers to sail on their ships having been
warned, there was an evident feeling
of uneasiness in shipping circles.
The new decree announced by Ger
many under which armed merchant
men will be sunk without warning be
comes effective March 1. The Espagne
is due to reach Bordeaux, Mar oh 4,
and would, therefore, be in hostile wa
ters when the order becomes effective.
Officials of the French. line said the
Bspagne would sail as scheduled. They
venture no opinion as to whether the
warning received by Mrs. Hillton was
from a responsible source. An investi
gation is being made, it was stated,
but early today little had been accom
plished.
The letter, enclosed In a type-writ
ten envelope, says:
"Madam.—It is understood that you
intend to sail within the next few days
upon the steamer Espagne for Bor
deaux, France. You are doubtless
fully aware of the intended submarine
policy which is to come into effect
any day and which will be carried out
rigorously, irrespective of the nation
ality of persons upon the vessel at
tacked. Therefore, assuming that you
are aware of the unusual and unneces
sary danger that you are to subject
yourself to, you are requested to re
ceive this warning as definite and un
questionably necessary and which you
are requested not to question, but to
accept for the safety of yourself and
family."
At are French line offices today, it
was announced that the departure of
the Espange had been postponed from
Thursday to Friday. The sailing had
been previously put over from today.
The delay In sailing is not due to the
warning letters, it was declared.
"We Ignore such reported warn
ings," it was said.

larger increase of the regular army.
