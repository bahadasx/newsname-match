furnished by tho defendant's law

May term of Court.
It is the opinion of many who
attonded the trial that the Hoard
indictment against ltobinson win
be dismissed without coming to
trial, because of the fact if the
evidence in tho Woodrpffcaso
tailed to convict ltobinson,
that
in the Hoard case would be even

GOV. STANLEY
SAYS NO MONEY
I For Illiterates
Now Num

Available Funds
REPAIRS ARE BADLY NEEDED
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 18. Gov.
Stanley in an interview granted; a
representative of a Louisville news,
paperloday, declared that he is op
posed To an appropriation for the
Kentucky Illiteracy Commission.
He realizes the importance of the
campaign against illiteracy, but de
clares that the financial condition of
the state forbids an appropriation for
the purpose, or for a number of
other meritorious purposes, wh.ch he
enumerated.
The governor's statement contains
the striking declaration, illustrative
of Kentucky's poverty, that the Insi
tuteforthe feeble-minded has been
condemned as unsafe and that' its
walls are likely to collapse at any
time, but that there is no money
available io avert such a catasteophe.
The interview follows
" There are many good things we
could do if we had the money.
fully realize the valne of the work of
the Illiteracy Commission. But I
would judge that there are as many
adults of the age of forty and beyond
who are suffering from tuberculosis
and preventable disease, and there is
some hope for these if action is taken
promptly in their behalf. The man
or woman who is suffering from tu
berculosis is certainly in worse con
dition than the man or woman who
may be suffering from ignorance,

With our children it's differ

Their tender little "insides"

If jour child's stomach, liver

ouly delicious "California Syrup

but gentle. Millions of mothers
keep this harmless "fruit laxa

love to take It ; that it never fails
to cleau the liver and bowels and
sweeten the stomach, and that
a teaspoonful given today saves
a sick child tomorrow.
Ask your druggist for a 50-ct
bottle of "California Syrup of

bottle. Beware of counterfeits
sold here. Sao that it is made
