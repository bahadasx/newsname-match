Columbia, Feb. 20.?Special t
The News and Courier: The sec
ond session of the seventy-firs
General Assembly of South Care
lina came to an end this morn
if? at 5.35 o'clock. It was not ye
midnight by the legislative clocl
when Senator Sharpe move'
that the Senate adjourn sine die
The final motion on the Hons
side was made by Represents
tiye J. W. Boyd. When the gav
els of Lieutenant Governo
Bethea and Speaker James A
Hoyt fell for the last time an
the members of the General A?
sembly trudged out, the firs
streaKs ot dawn were visible 1
the east. The end was calm an
peaceful, and there was nine
wringing of hands and expro
sions of mutual esteem an
friendhip as the various men
hers hade one another good-bv
and turned their faces norm
ward. There were 868 Acts pns<
ed by the Legislature at its r<
cent session.
The entire time of hot
houses from the moment the
assembled at 8 o'clock Saturda
night until they broke up at daj
light this morning was taken u
with detai1 incident to tli
clise. This consisted for the mos
part in adopting free conferenc
reports and ratifying bills. Th
houses spent most of the time i
recess, subject to the call of tl
Chair.
The usual jollification scene
occupied a large pla?e in the fii
al night. The piano, which hi
stood for several days in tt
lobby of the State House, w*
rolled into the House of Repr
sentatives and the niembei
gathered around it singing tl
old familiar tunes, ijrhich are a
ways a feature of the last nigl
of the session. As the night woi
on and the fact that the partir
would soon come was realize
the songs drifted more and mo:
to the entimental, culminatir
in the patriotic. A thrill wv
throughout the House when 11
group around the piano broke i
to the national anthem, and tl
feeling found its climax in tl
outburst of hand-clapping ar
cheering when "Dixie" wi
heard.
Representative Beckett Beaufort,
with his violin a
companied the piano, greatly
the enjoyment and pleasure
the throng
mere were several mock se
sions of the Senate and Hon
. during the hours of waitin
Senator Hughes. of Union, ar
Senator Leo. of Darlington,. 1<

and tho clever manner in whi<
they got off hits on the va?io'
Senators was fully appreciat.
bv the crowd, Reading Cle
Hutchison, of the House,
called in to to act as readii
clerk of the Senate at the 11101
session, and this he did in h
usual happy way. He was p-i
ticularly good in his burlesq
bills on the pet subjects whi
various Senators have kept
the front during the session.
. .On the House side Represent
tive Odom of Chesterfield, ai
Representative Massey of La
caster, wore the Speakers f
the mock session, and they a
a good team.
There were several resolutio
put through uist before Una!
