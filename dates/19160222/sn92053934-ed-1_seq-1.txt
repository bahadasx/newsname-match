FIRST CHIEF
OF NATION IS
PAID HOMAGE
Washington's Birthday Is
Observed by President
and Capital Folk.
LAST ADDRESS IS READ
Farewell Speech Oddly Fits!
Great Problems Now
Before Country.
Washington, Feb. 22. Every agency
of the American government paused to
day to pay homage to the memory of
George Washington, in the capital
which bears his name.
President Wilson, Secretary Daniels,
Ambassador Jusserand and other na
tional figures gathered at a celebration
at Continental Memorial hall under the
auspices of Associated Patriotic soci
eties. Both houses of congress suspended
business while Senator Johnson of
Maine and Representative Raker of
California read General Washington's
farewell address, giving warning
against "insidious wiles of foreign in
fluence," "mischiefs of foreign In
trigues" and "the Impostures of pre
tended patriotism." The farewell ad
dress has been read in congress every
year for generations, but probably
never before were Washington's words
bo closely applied to present day con
ditions. At Mount Vernon on the Potomac
wreaths and flowers were laid on the
first president's tomb, many made pil
grimages to the mansion and passed
through the rooms where he lived and
died, and others visited his monument.
Business in all executive depart
ments was suspended.
Wilson Presents Gold Medal.
At Continental Memorial hall ..he
president and a large audience ap
plauded the reading of Washington's
views on national preparedness in ex
cerpts from his messages to congress.
President. Wilson made no address,
but he presented a gold medal on be
half of the patriotic societies to Miss
Ina M. Lawrence, winner of an essay
contest on "The Campaign Against
Quebec in 1775," among school chil
dren of the District of Columbia.
Vice President Marshall in designat
ing Senator Johnson to read the ad
dress, said:
"In a time of stress and tumult
when men, mad with the lust of pas
sion and war, are seeking to tear up
the ancient landmarks of civilization,
it is fit that the Father of the Republic
should be honored in the United States
snate chamber and that the concen
trated wisdom of his lifetime should be
listened to. not only by the senate but
by the people."

THE WAR
TODAY
The forest of Givenchy, cast of
Souchez in northern France, near
the Belgian border, lias huh in
been the scene of sanguinary light
ing with marked advantage to the
Germans. A strong attack by Ger
man infantry developed in this
sector last night, resulting in the
capture of WX metres of French
positions, the Germans penetrat
ing beyond the first line trenches
at several places. They took some
825 prisoners. Paris declares that
the Germans were afterward driv
en out of all but a few of the com
municating trenches. Apparently
the Germans stluTTold all the iirst
line trenches gained.
A big Zeppelin airship was
brought to earth yesterday by tire
from the French antl aircraft guns
near ltrabant-Le-Koi and it is be
lieved the crew perished as the
Zepielin took Are while in the air.
Austrian aeroplanes made a
raid on Italian territory yesterday
and by dropping bombs in the
province of Brescia, killed four
persons and wounded five. The
property damage was slight.
Fights between air craft of the
allies and the Germans have been
frequent of late and several raids
by the allies have occurred, not
ably on the German aviation field
at Habshelm, at Mulhausen, and
on a munitions factory at Pagny-Sur-Mosellc.
Paris reports that
several of the German aeroplanes
were brought down by lire from
the French airmen.
Near Lihons, south of the
Somme river, the Germans were
repulsed by the French in an at
tack extending over more than
four miles. The offensive move
ment was preceded by a heavy
bombardment and clouds of as
phyxiating gases. When the Ger
man infantry endeavored to come
out of their trenches for the at
tack, the French fire stopped them
everywhere, according to Paris.
In Champagne, the forest of
the Argonne and in the entire re
v 1
pinn of Verdun, the French claim
much execution was accomplish
ed by their gunners. The Ger
mans claim to have repulsed the
British along the Iser canaL
The Russians have captured
BItuIs on lake Van and are per
sistently following the Turks who
fled from Erzernm.
Constantinople Is in a stale of
consternation on account of the
presence in the Bosphorus of a
submarine belonging to the allies.
It is said to have torpedoed six
Turkish transports loaded with
munitions.
The Turks lost heavily in the
fighting resulting in the capture
of Erzernm by the Russians, ac
cording to a Petrograd dispatch
today, which estimates their loss
at 40.000 killed, wounded and
prisoners.
Following np their victory ener
getically, the Russians are pursu
ing the Turks westward from Er
zerum, as well as to the north and
the south, as the Turkish forces
have split and fled in all direc
tions. On the north, Trebizond Is
threatened, the Russians having
poshed close to the Black sea port
In their operations along the coast,
while the Russian forces from Er
zernm are rejiorted ncarlng the
coast city.
Differences between Greece and
the entente allies over military
questions appear in a way to be
smoothed out as the result of a
visit of General Sarrail.the French
commander In the Balkans, to King
Constantino.
The Austrian are continuing
their air raids over Italian terri
tory. The latest flights were
across the province of Bresica
and towards Milan.

WILSON SAYS
ISSUE GRAVE
NOT CRITICAL
President Explains Foreign
Situation to Chairmen
Stone and Flood.
UNITED STATES FIRM
Nation to Hold Position That
Merchantmen Be Armed
for Defense.
Washington, Feb. 22. Last night's
conference between President Wilson,
Senator Stone and Representative
Flood, chairmen of the congressional
committees dealing with foreign af
fairs, and Senator Kern, the demo
cratic floor leader, was said authori
tatively today to have been held in
order that the president might inform
the congressional leaders on the status
of the negotiations with Germany over
submarine warfare.
The president told the three leaders
that while the foreign situation was
grave it was not critical. It is under
stood he said the United States would
remain firm in its position that mer
chantmen have a right to arm for de
fensive purposes.
Senator Stone will maue a speech
this week replying to former Senator
Root's attack on the administration
before the republican state convention
in New York.
Washington, Feb. 22. Discussion of
foreign affairs on the floor of the sen
ate by administration senators was
awaited with, unusual interest today
following last nfght's White house con-
T'fWftiU' " between 'President Wilson,
Chairmen Stone and Flood of the sen
ate and house foreign affairs commit
tees, and Majority Leader Kern of the
senate.
The conference was held at the in
stance of Senator Stone, who is to ad
dress the senate later on in the week
on the admittedly grave situation re
sulting from the announced intention
of the central powers to sink, after
Feb. 29, all armed merchant ships of
the enemy.
Officials Are Silent.
While all of the participants in the
meeting declined to talk, it was under
stood that it had to do with Senator
Stone's speech, in which he is to dis
cuss from the administration's view
point the recent negotiations over sub
marine warfare. The administration
leaders object particularly to reports
that the United States changed its po
sition toward the arming of merchant
men for defensive purposes when the
Lusitania case apparently was virtu
ally settled.
Following the conference, Senator
Stone talked with Secretary Lansing,
who, it was said, furnished the sena
tor with information to be used in his
speech.
Lusitania Assurances Hold Good.
Confidential advices from Berlin to
day indicate that Germany soon will
inform the United States that her
previous assurances that unresisting
liners will not be attacked without
warning, hold good for future sub
marine operations, provided, however,
that such liners do not carry arma
ment. The German government will con
tend, the advices state, that what now
is characterized as defensive arma
ment, really is offensive armament
when submarines are concerned, and
will propose discussion with the Uni
ted States of what defensive armament
properly may be.
As none of the British and French
liners now clearing from American
ports carry any guns whatever, such
assurances from Germany will be in
the nature of reassurances for the
safety of neutrals they carry, even un
der the terms of the new submarine
campaign.
Would End Negotiations?
There were Intimations from offic
ial quarters today that the United
States would not permit the negotia
tions over the general subject of arm
ed ships to be drawn out Indefinitely.
It is believed, however, that Ger
many informing the United States that
the past assurances still apply to un
armed liners, but adhering to Its in
tention to sink without warning lin
ers that are armed rather than place
their submarines and crews In what
the Berlin government considers need
less danger, and asking the United
States what defensive armament it
considers Justified under international
law, that diplomatic negotiations may
be somewhat extended.

FIFTEEN STATES
JOIN FIGHT UPON
LIQUOR TRAFFIC
Washington, Feb. 22. Attorney gen
erals of 15 states today filed with the
supreme court a joint' argument in
support of the constitutionality of the
West Virginia liquor law prohibiting
the receipt and possession of intoxicat
ing liquors for personal use, and of
tho federal Webb-Kenyon liquor law
prohibiting the shipping of intoxicat
ing liquors into states for use in vio
lation of state laws.
" TKe""Statearetrresented were Ari
zona, Georgia,. Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,
Mississippi, North Carolina, North Da
kota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Caro
lina, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington
and Alabama.
The decision of the court in the
West Virginia cases, now before the
court for oral argument, is expected
to be the most important adjudication
in the temperance fight in a decade.
"If a citizen of a state has a right
to obtain intoxicating liquors for his
own use in any quantity or in unlim
ited quantities," says the attorney
genera!,, "it would seem to follow he
should at least have the right to manu
facture such liquor for his own use
from the products of his own labor,
and yet it is settled he has not such
right."
