WORKS BLOW UP
Oakland, Cal?, .Fob,' II. For the
-aecond time In six months dry house
.No. 8 of the TroJanPowder com
liany'a works at San Lorenio became
Ignited and exploded, causing the Im
mediate death of the' attending me
chanic, Emll Bryant. '
The flames were confined to the
one building, which waa totally de
molished. Because of the Isolation
of tht plant near the waters of the
"bay no further damage was done.
The fire and the subsequent explo
sion was a duplication of tht previous
one, which cost the life of William
O'Brien, who was the mechanic.
Deputy" Marshal Chris Hopper
made ft cursory Investigation Into
tht accident and reported his belief
that the explosion waa caused by the
unusual high temperature of the dry
ilng kilns.
Hopper said he could sot estimate
-the amount of powder destroyed.
Inasmuch as the- explosion, was felt
distinctly In Oakland, It Is believed
there was considerable dry powder
In tht building. Tht value of tho
'.Imlldlng was about $10,000. :

Tht Germans lost heavily,
Tht Germane charged after mak

wort' destroyed at many points y
tht "Busy Berths," and afterward
tht Teutons used nesrly 8,000 men
for successive attacks along a front

Answering the German moves, the
( French streamed shrapnel, machine
gun nre ana explosive shells upon the
advancing men, and .directed
counter-attacks from the third Itne
trenches. ' ' '
Strong artillery fighting around
Verdun was regarded as possibly the

III
: Washington, Feb. 12. Tht United
Statea will have available at the end
of five years more than 1,000,000
trained soldiers 'If plans of house
leaders materialise, -'-.
These plans, on wbtch the military
committee Is now working to frame
Its bill, call for the following:
Increase of the regular army to
1B0.000 men. ! .;,
Increase of the mllltla, under a
plan of foderalisatlon', to 425,000.'
Provision for a reserve of 75,000
regulars and 100,000 militiamen
through annual retirement.
Whether President Wilson will ac
cept the house plan for tederallslng
the mllltla. Is uncertain. As It now
I stands, this plan would provide for
merely nominal state control, for
drafting the mllltla In case of war,
and would 'bar the militiamen from
federal pay unions there were uni

ficials . professed today to feel no
uneasiness about warnings of peril
for the French liner Espagne, re
ceived by American -passengers book
ed to sail on her for Bordeaux Thurs
day. Indeed, they, claimed not to
ha-va seen any of tht warnings. An
Investigation Is known to be under
way, however, at to' tht source of a
warning sent to Mrs. F. B. Hilton,
one of those scheduled to sail. . The
Etepsgne officers said the ship will
sail on scheduled time, but they re
fused to express an opinion as to
whether the warning came from a re
sponsible source. ,v
Officials refused to believe that the
warnings portend a repetition of the
Lusltanla esse, though they recol
lected that like warnings had been
sent before that vessel. left port last
spring. The present warnings called
attention to the fact that Austria and
Germany are about to put into effect
a policy of submarine attacks against
armed enemy merchant ships.
, The warning letter to Mrs. Hilton
said:- .... : v ' .. ';.
"Madame: It is understood you In
tend to sail within a few days upon
tht Espagne (or Bordeaux. You are
doubtless aware of the intended sub
marine policy coming into effect any
day which will be carried out vigor
ously and Irrespective of the nation
ality of passengers, Therefore, as
suming that you are aware of the
unusual and unnecessary danger to
which you are subjecting yourself,
you are requested to accept this
warning as a definite one, which you
are roqueatod not to question, but to
accept for the safety of yourself and
family." . ... ,

PORTLAND TOIiG
MEMBERS III WAR
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Portland, Feb. ' 22. A general
clean-up of Chinatown probably will
be ordered . by rtHstrict Attorney
Evans today as a result of the tong
battle . yesterday, when four Hop
Sing highbinders chased Wong
Chlng, an aged member of the Bow
Leon g tong, down the street and
emptied two revolvers Into his body.
With four bullet wonds, Wong was
In a critical condition at the hospital
today.
Julian Alabero, a Chinese-Filipino,
is in the city jail, suspected as one of
the shooters. It was Alabero who
was identified In November, 1914, as
the Hop Sing highbinder who enter
ed the restaurant of Jim Wong, a
prominent Suey Sing,: and stabbed
him In the hack aa he sat eating a
bowl of rice.
For some mysterious reason Ala-
ibero wns released titer his knife
had stirred up the tong war of which
the present troubles are a part
Double patrols of police have been
ordered to . Chinatown by Chief
Clark. Reports from LaOrande, The
Dalles, Seattle and other cities, tell
of suspicious arrivals and departures
In Chinatown. The Bing Kong mem
ber who was badly cut and beaten
at LaOrande last week la still In a
serious condition.
The Hop Sings,' most warlike and
powerful of all the war tongs in the
northwest, have been badly worsted
In most of the clashes thus far. Their
opponents," the Ring Kongs, Bow
Leon gs "and Suey Sings, have, kept
to their homes, coming Into the open
only to strike viciously and fatally,
then ' disappearing behind barred
doors again. ,
Yesterday's blow was struck by the
Hop Sings and calls for the shedding
of more' Hop Sing blood at the hands
of the allies. Their victim, however,
was hardly worth the chase. Poor
old Wong Chlng could not run fast
enough to give the lithe 'Hop Sing
gunmen a merry chase.' But most
likely he will die. I

Washington, Feb. 22. The Wil
son bill, granting preference rights
to applicants In tht Oregon and Cali
fornia land grant cases, was termed
"loaded'! by Chairman Ferris of tht
house public lands committee.
WOson'a hill to one of several deal-
log with the land cases on which
hearings art now jn progress. Con
stantino Smytht of the department
of justice told the committee that
the plan would promote fraudulent
locators and would give raluablt
Oregon timber tracts worth f 20,00 0-
000 to men having no right to recog
nition. , , , ' ,.
Sraythe also disapproved of tht
Hawley bill because that gives prefer
ence rights to persons whom tht
courts have declared hold no stand
ing, and because It falls to pay taxes.
At the tame time, he objected to
tht Raker bill because it does sot
settle the whole question at once, hut
he did favor the Chamberlain hflL t
- .The chief -"contention lit the -committee
promises to he whether tht
government should stop with reaum-
ing title. to the lands, as the Raker
resolution proposes, or to decide what
shall be done with them. Raker con
tends that It Is the first duty of con
gress to take over the title,-leaving
disposition of the holdings to future
legislation.
Other pending matters, he holds,
will not allow congress time in which
to thresh out the details in the six
months allowed by the courts for
settling the situation, .' ,
The Oregon view, to be pressed by
Congressman Slnnott, is that the sub
ject should 'be disposed of in one
bill. Instead of allowing the legisla
tion to drag on, inasmuch as in the
meantime nearly $2,000,000 in taxes
due to .Oregon- counties would re
main unpaid. Oregon demands Im
mediate relief on the tax situation.
