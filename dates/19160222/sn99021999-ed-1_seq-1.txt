ELEVENTH ANNUAL
MOTOR EXPOSITION
IS IN FULL SWING
Million-Dollar Show in Unanimously
Declared Greatest Ever Held

MANY BUYERS IN THE CROWDS
L ' With city folk, farmers and the
'Jj "r,J 'dealers, all bubbling over with en-
thusiasm, surging up and down the
aisles In crowds, the eleventh an
nual Omaha motor exposition opened
yesterday under the most auspicious
circumstances ever attending the
opening of an Omaha auto how.
Even those, who have visited the
wonderful automobile exhibitions at
New York and Chicago were com
pelled to admit that "you've got to
give Omaha credit." "
While It wasn't necessary to call
ont the police reserves to thwart a
von Hindenberg attack on the doors
as was the case last year, the crowd
last night was one of the biggest
ever to attend a show. Last year
hundreds upon hundreds of compli
mentary, tickets were Issued for
opening night and dealers distrib
uted them lavishly among their
friends and acquaintances. This
year nary a complimentary ticket
was Issued. Even the dead-head
fiends couldn't "brace" their wav
Xpast the- door. That is the reason
It wasn't necessary to call out the
police. If a . similar number of
gratis admissions had been issued
this year, with the Immense paid at
tendance that was on hand last night,
It would have been necessary to call
out the militia.
In a Baying; Crowd.
On of the most enjoyable features last
night, from the dealer's standpoint, was
that the crowd was a buying- crowd. While
there was. of coarse, the usual number
of the curious, which always flock in on
opening night, the greater part of the
crowd consisted of persona vitally inter
ested In motor rare. The buying Kind.
Every single dealer and saleaman In the
place added from a doaen to a score of
Mines to hie "immediate prospect" list.
. Jlvery .man,, woman. and. child who at
tended the big' exposition last night -returned
name relating the virtues of the
show.; Never before has such a wonder
ful display of machines been made. It Is
truly a million-dollar show.
The V finest, work of the expert crafts
man, be be designer, engineer or me
chanlo, is represented. Luxurious limou
sines,, dainty coupes, solid-looking tour
ing cars, smart roadsters and saucy run
abouts are included in every exhibit of
Pleasure oars, while down la the base
ment the great, massive trucks and the
serviceable-looking, light delivery cars
are displayed. In the north corridor the
motorcycle holds sway and the newest In
gas bikes seemed to be as popular as the
newest in the four-wheeled species.
.. Deroratloa Appeal.
The decorations attracted much atten
tion and were acknowledged as the best
ever. ' The oriental effect produces the
two-fold effect of cozlness and magnifi
cence. The big Auditorium truly has the
appearance of the most superb motor pal
ace, and at the same time radiates that
comfortable feeling of cosiness which
makes one seem perfectly at home and
among friends.
Neble's Symphony orchestra, assisted
by the La Salle quartet of Chicago, pro
vided the musical entertainment The ef
forts of the quartet were especially en
joyable and several times the crowd
topped to applaud the artists.
It was Omaha night last night . and
Omaha turned out nobly. The auto show
opens again this morning at 9:30 and will
remain open continuously until 10:30 to
night. Foandry Destroyed by Fire.

viding a system of marketing that will
be under the supervision of the producer
and "friendly to 'his Interests: a'systeia
that will be In a position to locate the de
mand as well as the supply and provide a
means of getting the two interests to
gether on the most equitable and econom
