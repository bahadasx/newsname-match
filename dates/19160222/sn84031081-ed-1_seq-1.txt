Homing, .V. M., Feb. 21. The true,
cts of the gun battle, in which j
f;
Sheriff D. It. Stephens was killed, be
came known only late this afternoon!
when those who had been eyew itness- j
es to the fight began to return to j
Doming'. The stories circulated In,
Hincon last night were badly garbled, j
oven when eonlrlbuted by those w ho, j
under less stress, were In a position j
to furnish the tacts. j
There were tvn men actually en-i
gaged ill the blulle whose prestV-!
was unknown to others ulso engaged. ;
These two men were Jack Arnold j
and Wayne Kstes, who came upon the
iin
Koene lust as Deputy Sheriff J
Kelly opened the fight from the top j
of the hill.
There was no road whore the fight,
took place. Tho cur used by the
bandits had been run up a small sandy j
arroyo at the base of the small hill,
which figures largely in the tragedy,!
about one mile northeast of Hincon in j
the foothills. Tho jaiioreaners were

sound
of tho ears of the pursurtig officers.
They sprang to the edge of the ar
rovo and were thereby protected to

a great extent all during the
that followed. John Kelly was the
first man to discover the fugitives
after arriving on top of the hill. He
opened fire. Jack Arnold and Wayne
Kstes joined him and so did J. O. Ta
