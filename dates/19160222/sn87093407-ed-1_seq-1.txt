ONE CENT
Fleecing Seattle millionaires, wealthy banker* and
prominent official* out of thousand* of dollar* by an
ingeniously devised blackmailing scheme by which the
victims were secretly photographed in compromising
scenes, a syndicate of "badger" artist*, said to have
been counseled and advised by two Seattle attorneys, is
today facing wholesale arrests.
Warrant* have already been issued for the arrest of two
women. Several further arre*t* are to he made. + /
Upon information furnished to Prosecutor I.undin hy
Sheriff Hally, who has heen on the trail of the alleged black
mailer* for several week*, the arrest* of IjlhanJVterson of
Hilling*, Mont., and Isabel (,'laberg of I.o*
ordered. Officials in these cities were duly wired to that
effect.
These women arc specifically accused of blackmailing
a wealthy Seattle lum!>erman UrnimSana.
Millionaires, multi-millionaire* and rrfen of national a*
well a* internatonal affair* are said to be among the victim*
According to the confe**ion. the two women worked
hand-inhand here with a prominent firm of attorney* in
luring the wealthy "dupes" to handsomely furnished house*
•ituated in various part* of the city, where, by clever manipu
lation, photograph* were made of the victims in compromising
situation*.
Fabulous sum* of money, frequently a* much a* $10,000
and $15,000, it i« declared, were obtained when the victims
were confronted with the photograph* and were sold the
negatives.
Victim List Reads Like Blue-Book
The li*t of victim* read* like a "blue-bonk" of Seattle
societv.
Actual photograph* of some of the mo*t prominent men
in finani ial and commercial affair* here, bankers, owner* of
downtown <tk?«4raper», and otl»«r< ( are l»eld in the *herHf*
office a* evidence again*t the several person* to be arrested.
The alleged gang ha* operated all up and down the Pa
cific coa*t, it i- charged. Warrant* are to be asked for by
Sheriff Hodge and Deputy Hally for the arrest of several other
women. Arrest of the higher-up* in the affair is a matter
of hours, it is said
The syndicate has operated under protection from the
police, according to the woman confessor. JIS^M4
'I he story of the plot and its unfolding, ot th 4 quiet, cau
tious investigations by Deputy Sheriff Hally. reads like fiction.
If all the alleged facts gathered by Hally during the la«t
two months, which Jed up to the woman's final confession,
prove true, the greatest tale of crime in the history of the
Pacific coast has been brought to light.

Chance Remark Starts Investigation
(jeoree liealev. a county jail prisoner, a* he was being
booked for alleged burglary, eight week* ago, muttered the
remark :
"This is a frame-up on the part of Chief Lang and De
tective Humphries to get me. I know too much about them."
Deputy f I ally, in the days following, questioned Healey
concerning his reason* for making such a statement.
Healey, in the course of his talks with Hally, said he
had equipped a house on Belmont ave., with a secret device
for htinV ~
"" A Unman Itan engaged hinv he told Hally, to perform
the carpenter work. Vi>, V*
I LkK V Oll'vmvi n"i «*. ' '
Rig Up Camera to Take Bedroom Pictures
He had made a secret camera room under the stairway,
he said, and had cut a hole thru the wall looking into a
bedroom. With the camera placed in position, a photograph
of the interior of the bedroom could be obtained.
Hally made a thoro investigation, found the 'jjkint" as
Ifieatey had described it, and called the woman to the sheriff's
office.
She admitted she had been a member of the "badger"
syndicate and revealed, in several successive interviews, the
names of other members as well as those of the persons
victimized.
One victim. Hally says the woman told him, had been
followed by the gang for two years. Their efforts to "land"
him took than half way around the globe, but he finally
"fell," it is said, for $10,000.
Another, a prominent banker, is said to have been black
mailed to the extent of $5,000 on one occasion, after he had
been shown a picture of himself and a young woman clasped
in each other's arms. The next week, it is alleged, another
photograph was taken of the same man in a compromising
situation with another young woman, and he was again
forced to pay a large sum as the price of silcnce.
How Rich Men Were Approached
•\ftrr the photograph of a victim had been secured, n
member of the law firm, it is said, would call the victim to
his office.
There he was informed that thru another attorney his
wife was about to start divorce proceedings. He was also
told <>f the existence of the photograph, a copy of which lie
was shown, with the result that lie invariably "came tliru"
with a large sum.
Nearly a score of women are said to be included in the
group of "sirens." They worked not only in Seattle, it is
said, but in nearly every other city on the Pacific coast and
in Spokane.
The confession of the Belmont ave. woman in part
follows:
About September. 1014, I went

here to postpone operation of
the Teutonic decree of war

WASHINGTON. Feb. 22 —
The admlnletration today prac
tically decided to end the In
formal conferencea between
Secretary Laming and German
Ambaaaador Von Bernatorff
over diplomatic queationa and
to dlapatch a formal note to
Germany, emphaaixing tho
need for unequivocal aaiur
ancea about Teutonic aubma
rine warfare.
The only thing that ran inter
vene to frustrate this plan Is tho
arrival of definite assurances that
the Teuton proclamation of war
fare against arm»'d merchantmen
will not become effective March 1,
as ordered.
Moreover, Germany must make
surh assurances square with the
promise* itlven during the Luai
tanla negotiations.
Autho-ltles expressed concern
over the receipt of anonymous
warnings by American passenger*
booked to sail Thursday from New
York on the KVench liner Espagne.
The president conferred last
night with Chairmen Stone and

St-cretary of State Lansing and
the president conferred today for
half «n hour at the White House
on the ljusltanla situation, but

Friends are putting pressure on
the president to have him convey
to the country a clear Idea of tho
statua of pending negotiations, ex
