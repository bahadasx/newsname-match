MIDJI MAN ASKS
^NGRESSMAN TO
EXPLAIN ACTION
J. J. Opsahl, +'Aent of 1855 Treaty
Enforcement League, Writes
Congressman Lindbergh.
DEMANDS THAT INDIAN
TREATIES BE ENFORCED
Asks That Representative Take No
Action That Would Lead to An
nulment of Treaty.
As a result of a letter writ
ten a short time ago by
Congressman A Lindbergh to a
Brainerd man, saying that he was in
favor of abrogating the Indian treaty,
much action has been taken by local
men in favor of the treaty to oppose
the annulment of the treaty.
Sunday ,a Law Enforcement or
ganization was formed in Bemidji
Today, Opsahl, president of the
1855 Treaty Enforcement League,
wrote a letter to Congressman Lind
bergh asking him to explain his ac
tion
Mr Opsahl's letter is as follows:
Bemidji, Minn, Feb 21, 1916
Hon A Lindbergh,
Washington, Dear Sir:
Have noted the newspaper reports
on your 1855 Indian treaty comment
in which you are quoted as follows:
1st. That you will introduce a
bill to revoke the treaty if the ma
jority of the people of your district
demand it.
2nd That this treaty is obsolete
and has outlived its usefulness.
3rd That the dignity of the state
is affected.
As you are generally frank in
your declarations, I would like to
have a little more information on
these three points raised by you.
1st In which way are you to de
termine the majority's wishes? Two
years ago several thousand from
this district sent your requests
to go to the interior department and
ask for enforcement of the 1855 law,
as "home protection
2nd On the point of obsoleteness:
How about the fact that we have at
the present time more Indians in this
part of Minnesota than in 1855, if
Indians are the only consideration,
but have not you, as well as a few
others overlooked the fundamental
principle and purpose of the treaty,
"its home protection?"
When the commissioners repre
senting congress met with the Indian
chiefs to negotiate the treaty, it was
done for the purpose of securing this
vast tract of agricultural forest and
mining land area, for homes for cit
izens of the United States, irrespec
tive of color of skin, and no doubt the
chiefs looked forward to the day that
at least part of red brothers would
live there as good, full-pledged cit
izens of the United States as any im
migrant from a king's or kaiser's
realm across the Atlantic, and the
conditions of these chiefs, which was
accepted and ratified by congress,
was that the "Big Father" could have
these lands as the homes for the cit
izens of the United States, red or
white, but one of the conditions was
that "booze" should be kept out of
the district. The Indian wards were
selling the lands and moving out as
one of the conditions. Whites were
expected to move in, and the purpose
was to keep "booze" away from the
red and white alike, and the commis
sioners as well as the chiefs agreed
that: Booze never had, and never
would tend to make better Indians,
better homes, better and happier
mothers, better citizens, miners,
bankers, lumbermen, railroad men or
tarmers
Now, has the treaty become obso
lete because of the fact that citizens
of the United States moved in, as ex
pected by the chiefs and congress,
or has it been proven that the old
chiefs and our former congress were
mistaken in their contention that
booze was detrimental to moral, in
dustrial and happy home develop
ment?
Will your arguments on the obso
leteness of the 1855 treaty be based
on that the chiefs erred, and that
booze is now needed to build more
happy homes, to raise better boys and
girls, produce better railroad, farm,
mill and mining laborers, or better
bankers and legislators? If you can
prove this we will not oppose the ab
rogation of the 1855 treaty.
3rd. As to your point that the
dignity of the state is affected, I was
a little surprised. The first para
graph of the official oath of office of
the governor of Minnesota, the" chief
sponsor for the state's dignity and
honor, swears, first, to uphold and
enforce the laws of the Federal
union, then of the state, and if he
wishes to be true to his oath of of
fice there would be no need of mar
tial law in this part of the state to
fight the invading booze enemy, be
cause the government has ample
power through the state, county and
municipal departments, if he has the
"ciSf ""St T*''*' ^"^zz 'j-?gSH^i
will and backbone, as well as the
honor of the state at heart, and the
same holds true with other officials
over which the governor holds ex
ecutive power. It should be clearly
settled and understood that the spe
cial Federal officers in this district
are not here of their own or the de
partment's own accord to force de
partment or Federal orders upon the
district. But they are here upon the
demand and request of the citizens
of the United States and the state
of Minnesota, who demanded of the
Federal government to enforce the
law where the state has failed or
side-stepped its sworn duty, and it
may be well to advise you and your
friends that up to date the Federal
department and the Federal officers
have not closed a single town in the
treaty zone except upon strong de
mands from citizens of the state of
Minnesota to do so. Those citizens
acted within their full legal rights,
and I firmly believe you and others
of your friends could do the most good
for the honor and dignity of the
state of Minnesota by going to the
governor and brace him up or back
him up to do his full duty as a cit
izen of the Federal union, as well as
of the state, and for the state of
Minnesota and its citizens to obey
the Federal as well as the state laws.
I have been frank to you as our
representative in this matter, and
will appreciate a prompt and frank
reply Yours truly,
J. J. OPSAHL,
President 1855 Treaty Enforcement
League.
