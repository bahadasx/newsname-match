I LEWISTON'S PUMPING
PLANT SCHEME FEASIBLE
I SAYS THE ENGINEER
I $60,000.00 Expenditure Will Insure

I nent Citizens Interested.
H D. C. Hcnoy, consulting englneor
(or tho United States Reclamation
H service with headquarters at Port
H land, Oregon', was In Cache Valley
H the latter part ot the week In con-
sulfation with Engineer T. H. Hum
H phrcys on the matter of tho InBtnlla
I Hon of a pumping plant on Bear Rlv
I cr west of Falrvlewf tho waters from
I which are to he used In tho lrrlga
I tion of approximately 10,000 acres
H of land In Lewlston.
H Tho Lewlston flat has been lrrlgat-
I cd from tho waters ot Cub Illver In
tho past. The Lewlston Cub river
H canals havo a carrying capacity ot
H approximately 145 second feet, but
H since the sugar factory has been
H erected, the waters required for the
H crops of that section have been far
too little In tho low season to pro
B vide sufficient water to' maturo the
H crops as they should he..
H A. L. Hyer one of tho principal
H farmers of Lewlston has been work-
H ing on this project for the past threo
H years. Following the dry season last
H fall when tho beet crop was a par-
H tlal failure on account of the scare-
H lty of water, Mr. Hyer and some as-
V soclates were able to interest qulto
U a number of men in tho proposed
W tyoject and today a company has
been organized, stock subscribed and
within a few days incorporation pa
pers will bo filed showing tho fol
lowing directors: A. L. Hyer, T. S.
Karren, O. A. Hogan, Joseph Quin

reys has been employed as engineer.
Mr. Humphreys has had a wide ex
perience In irrigation projects having
been engineer in tho Government Re
clamation Servlco for a number of
years. He, with Mr. Henoy, went
over tho schomo on Friday and gives
the assurance that it is feasible,
simple and one 'of the best pumping

Mr. Humphreys have yet been iden

LARGE CROP
OF BEET SEED
TO BEPLANTED
B. Juszklevlck, agricultural super
intendent for U. S . Beet Seed Comp.
any, with headquarters nt Idaho Falls
' was In Logan yesterday and in comp.
any with Charles'. O. IHydo, field man
for tho Amalgamated Sugar Company
In Cacho Valloy, was going over tho
lay of tho county and ranplng out a
policy for managing tho crop of beet
seed for this valloy this year.
Between threo and four hundred
acres of ground will bo planted to
seed in Cacho Valloy this year. The
land t0 bo planted has been selected
In North Logan, Hydo Park and
Lewlston. Nino hundred tons of
Hi beets are scattered over this torrl-
pj tory in pits for tho planting and they
"jiw aro ln Sd condition. Plans probo-
Ing laid to supply tho entire west
with sugar beet seed frora Cacho
Vnlloy and Box Eldor County, oxporl-
mentfl havo shown conclusively that
somo of tho best scod on tho mnrkot
can bo produced hero.

of preparation, and within a short
time bids can bo expected to bo call
ed for on tho work of this project
fiosldcs tho pumping plant there Is
Involved a mile and a half of canal
work and 400 feet of flvo foot pipe,
together with tho headgates and tho
tending structures with an approxi
mate cost of $60,000. Tho Idea Is to
Install the equipment of the bet
possible tpo and mako It a modern
pumping plant ln every particular.
Tho static lift is 87 feet to bring .the
water from Bear River to tho level
where gravity will conduct tho Tow
over the canal system.
During tho past few years tho
Utah Power and Light Company has
been diverting tho water of Bear
River during flood season Into Bear
Lake and storing these waters until
after the flood season when they
aro gradually turned out of Bear
Lako and allowed to flow down the
Bear River channel to mako suffici
ent water flow to supply tho needs
of tho Clraco and Oneida Powor
Plants. After It has served this pur
pose It Is available for Irrigation
projects. Lewlston requires about
145 second feet to take care of the
farming section, but during the low
season tho flow In their system frora
Cub River diminishes to about 40
socond feet, and as a result the crops
diminish with tho flow of water.
Contracts havo been entered Into
which nro both satisfactory to tbo
Utah Power & Light Company and
the farmers.
As soon as this project Is complet
od and if It proves satisfactory, Mm
llar pumping plants will bo Installed
In other sections of Cacho Valley, one
especially Is being considered very
carefully for the dry farm bench
lands near Cacho Junction.
The Interesting feature of the Lew
lston project is the fact that tho cost
of installing the plant together with
depreciation and operation win be
less than ono half tons of beets to
tho ucro for tho area served.
This cost will bo less than many
of tho gravity systems.

VIA PARADISE
NOW PROPOSED
State Road Commissioner Advises

Be Shortened

somo lmportanco that came boforo
thorn was that of a road from heit)

has mado a determined effort to bo
placed on tho Park Highway, but In
this matter has been opposed by
Brlgham City where overy effort has
been mado to divert travol by way
ot Malnd, so it Is now up to Logan
to seek another route that win bo
shorter, much bettor from a scenic
standpoint and with a better grado
All this can bo accomplished by tak
Ing tho southern route referred to
and tho commissioners will likely
tnko stops to got tho highway open
cd this season.
Prof. William Petorson of tho
Stato Road Commission appeared bo
fore tho board and cnlled tholr atten
lion to tho road matter, urging tint
somo definite action bo taken soon
Ills ndvlco was welcomed by tho
commissioners and It is practically
certain that tho now road will bo

says it shortens tho distance between
hero and Ogden, four miles and that
tho grndo will bo a light one.
