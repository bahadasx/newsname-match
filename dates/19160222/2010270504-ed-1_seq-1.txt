Seed Corn.
A week or two ago Mr. Zok called
the attention of the farmers to the
soed corn situation through the col
umns of your paper and ottered to
tost soed for them. No farmor has
brought In seed.
Howcvor, whcn passing icrlbs of
corn recently wc selected a fow of tho
best cars. Thesb show n gormlnatlon
of from 47 to 85 per cent. In the same
test seed that Mr. Zook selected early
last fall gave a germination test of
from 95 to 100 per cent. Mr. Zook
also tested some corn from tho shock
that I had hoped might bo suitable for
seed and got a germination of 2G per
cent. There Is enough good corn in
the county for seed but it cannot be
selected with tho scoop shovel or from
n crib of shelled corn. Only by unusu
ally careful selection and testing can
we hope for good seed. Tho seed
must bo picked now before the corn
has been shelled.
