INDEPENDENCIES
IN THE SCHOOL
Too Many Heads Now—Dr.
J. D. Taylor Makes State*
ment on Situation.
"The election of President John H.
Worst of the agricultural college as
professor emeritus of the North Da
kota agricultural collegre, by the
board of regents, Is the first step to
wards a complete reorganization of
the administration department of the
college—it is designed as the first
movement towards the concentration
of executive authority at the institu
tion, and is in line with the board's
desire to make the agricultural col
lege just what It ought to be—a col
lege for Instruction in agriculture/'
Sudh statement was made to The
Herald this afternoon by Dr. J. D.
Taylor of Grand Forks, member of
the board of regents.
Successor Not Named.
At the same time, Dr. Taylor de
clared emphatically that the board of
regents had not determined Upon Mr.
Worst's successor, statements to the
contrary notwithstanding. The re
ports have linked the names of
Treadwell Twichell, former speaker of
the houwofcrepreeentatlves, asweJI
as that of Franklin L. McVey, presi
dent of' the University of NorthDtu-
kota, with the appointment, but Dr.
Taylor said today that no selection
had been made, and sentiment had"
not centered on any Individual.
"The North Dakota agricultural
,» college situation is the first the board
of regents has taken positive steps
in, because It appeared to members
of the board as demanding immediate
notion. The step was taken only aft
er thorough inquiry by members of
the board—each member having
spent some little time personally
looking over the college affairs.
Too Many Heads.
"In the past few years, friction has
developed within, the collegre, among
members of the faculty. A number
of 'independencies,' as it were, have
grown up within the institution, giv
ing too many heads to it.
Best for Greatest Number.
"I will say that the board of re
gents is interested only in that which
is of the greatest benefit to the great
est number of people. We want to
give consideration to every individual
on the college faculty, and I believe
that, by our election of Mr. Worst as
professor emeritus, by which he con
tinues with the college, on salary, we
have shown him the courtesy and
consideration due him tor his 20
years' service.
"As for the other members of the
faculty of the college—whether they
have been for or against Mr. Worst,
or whether they have been at logger
heads with otfhet departments within
the college—we will treat all with th«»
same consideration we have displayed
for Mr. Worst.
"The board of regents is Interest
ed solely in the upbuilding of the
agricultural college. Just as It is in
terested in the upbuilding and main
tenance of every other institution.
Needs a New Man.
"The board of regents, after careful
study, has considered it advisable to
call a new man to the presidency of,
the agricultural college—a man who
will be governed solely by the merits
of each proposition as it comes to
him, and who will be entirely free
from entanglements that may have
grown out of service under the pres
ent administration. A man who has
been connected with the college
would, without doubt, find himself
governed In the handling of some
propositions, by his previous affilia
tions within the college.
"Just who that man will be, we do
not at Jt'his time know. No choice
has been made.
"To bring about the greatest serv
ice at the agricultural college, every
citizen must recognise the need for
a central governing head. The board
of regents recognizes that proposition,
and will seek to faithfully discharge
its duty.
Kindly Towards Mr. Worst.
"I am surprised that Mr. Worst
takes the attitude that he has been
'fired.' Mr. Worst, I believe, has
been shown remarkable consideration.
His election as professor emeritus
places him in the position of being
ab|e to continue his Influence in be
half of tfte college. It is, In reality,
a mark of recognition that any man
might well crave, and the members
of the board have nought but the
kindliest feelings towards him, and
for. his work in building up the col
lege. As agriculture is the greatest
single industry within this state Its
agricultural college should be of the
greatest value to the state and the
board seeks to make it so. The in
terests of the state come first and the
reorganisation of its agricultural col
lege along constructive lines Is given
fliwt consideration.

Washington, Feb. 22.—Confidential
advices from Berlin lndloate that
Germany soon will inform the United
States that her previous assurances
that unresisting liners will not be at
tacked without warning, holds good
for future submarine operations, pro
vided, however, that such liners do
not carry armament.
Proposes Discussion.
The German government will con*
tend, the advices state, that what now
is characterized as defensive arma
ment, really is offensive armament
when submarines are concerned, and
will propose a discussion of what
defensive armament properly may be.
As none of the British or French
liners now clearing from American
ports carry any guns whatever, such
assurances from Germany will be In
the nature of reassurances for the
safety for neutrals they carry, even
under the terms of the new submarine
campaign.

SITUATION TOO
COMPUCATEDIN
This is Opinion Expressed
by Viscount Bryce in an
Interview.
SYMPATHY WITH
ALLIES, HE SAYS
Many Reasons why U. S.
Should be Friendly with
England and France.
Piaris, Feb. 22.—Viscount Bryce,
who heads the British delegation of
25 members of both houses of parlia
ment to the Anglo-French parlia
mentary committee, which is to hold
meetings here today Wednesday and
Thursday, gave an interview to the
Paris Journal.
Too Complicated.
"The situation in the United States
Is much too complicated and changes
too quickly from day to day," he
said, "for me to be able to form any
conjectures as to the manner in which
events concerning the Washington
government are liable to develop.
There is, however, one thing which
should be known and it is that the
sympathies of the great majority of
the American people go out clearly
and Indisputably to the allies.
Never Fears Difficulties.
"I never had the slightest fear of
real difficulties arising between the
United States and the allies because
it is hardly necessary for me to say
that there are historical reasons why
a genuine friendship should be felt In
the United States for fSnnce and
Great Britain."
I/OSES FINGER.
Hasen, N. D., Feb. 22.—Leona, the
6-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

had just been left by her father, and
in order to reach the lever bad drawn
up a box and was standing on that
when her 2-year-old brother came
along and in a playful manner gave
the box a kick which threw Leona
into the cogs of the machine.

GRAND FORKS, N. D., TUESDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 22, 1916. EIGHT PAGES—PRICE FIVE CtfNTS.
STATEMENT BY
JOHN BURKE ON
TMESENATORSHP
Will be Brought into Race,
Democrats Say, by Pres
ident Wilson.
NOT CANDIDATE
AT PRESENT TIME
Makes Such Declaration in
Letter to Prominent
Party Man.
John Burke, treasurer of the Uni
ted States, former governor of North
Dakota, will be forced into the race
for United States senator for North
Dakota at the behest of President
Wilson—because democratic leaders
see in Burke's candidacy an opportu
nity for the displacement of a repub
lican senator.
That Is the viewpoint accepted by
democrats throughout North Dakota,
and in furtherance of the scheme,
•they will circulate petitions asking
Burke to become such candidate.
They have hopes of getting 10,000
names on the petitions.
The recent announcement by John
Bruegger, national committeeman,
made to the state central committee,
that John Burke had decided to enter
the fight, has been declared by Mr.
Burke to have been untimely. In a
letter to a prominent North Dakota
democrat, Mr. Burke says:
"pt courw^ it was •. mlat|Lke to
announce my name, it w«er en
tlrely without authority and Mr.
Bruegger, I see, has had the
same corrected. I am sincere
when I say that I am not a can
didate, and that I do not want
to be a candidate, unless there is
a demand from the people for
my services. I have told this to
everyone that has asked me any
thing about It.
"There is no reason in the
world why I should get Into this
fight on my own account. If I
go in, it will be in response to a
demand for my services, and not
for the gratification of any am
bition."
With Burse's position so plainly
stated, the democrats of North Da
kota are determined to create a con
dition that will bring him in—and
next November, they anticipate seeing
the former governor opposing the re
publican nominee, whoever he may
be.

Milford, Conn., Feb. 22.—At least ten were killed and
50 injured when the Conneticut River Special from Spring
field, Mass., for New York, on the New Haven railroad,
was run into by a special passenger train. The latter train
was made up in New Haven to carry passengers who other
wise would have gone on the regular express from Boston
to New York.
Among the dead is the flagman of the Conneticut
River train, who had gone back to protect his train, which
had been stopped by a broken air-pipe. It is said the flag
man lost his life in a futile attempt to stop the special, run
ning up the track so close to the engine of the oncoming
train that he could not escape. His body was cut to pieces.
The rear-end collision occurred a moment later. At
the time of the collision, a freight train was running west
parallel with the passenger train on the next track. When
the smash came a passenger coach was jammed over
against the freight train. The boiler of the engine of the
special exploded, throwing wreckage in all directions. This
engine was then hurled down an embankment carrying two
coaches. These rolled over and over before touching the
bottom. Wreckage was piled high all about.
