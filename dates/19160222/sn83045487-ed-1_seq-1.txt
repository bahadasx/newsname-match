ARMY SYSTEM MAKES
SNOBS OJLOFFICERS
Privates Must Act as Bootblacks and Butlers Equality
Impossible Can't Keep Men in Service Under
' Present Conditions.
T BY GILSON GARDNER
Washington, Feb. 22 -Snobbery,
social caste and feudalism are what's
the matter with our army. The TJ. S.
system is modeled on that of Eng
land a system which has no place
in a republic It is undemocratic, in
efficient, unpopular and filled with
the danger of militarism.
Who says so?
Two officers in the regular army,
with whom I have talked, but who are
forbidden by army regulations to tflik
for' publication, have 'told me so.
Among others who think so I find
Will Irwin, war correspondent and
writer: Congressmen Callaway of
Texas, Dill of Washington, Sherwood
of Ohio, Bailey of Pennsylvania,
Gordon of Ohio, Dies of Texas and a
dozen others. The opinions of Her
bert Quick and Louis Post are well
known.
One of my unquotable military in
formants recently said: "Many peo
ple probably do not realize the degra
dation imposed on the enlisted man in
the U. S. Army. He is to all intents
tiJiaM.s. .
