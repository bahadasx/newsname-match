Lansing Cables London and
Calls for Answer as to
Seizure of Mails
Washington, D. C., Feb. 21.—State
department officials said today they
consider the submarine issue with
Germany still in a grave state be
cause the Lusitania agreement,, in the
light of the newly announced sub
marine policy of the Germanic pow
ers, contains no assurances for the
future, and officials do not feel that
it clearly guarantees against another
such disaster as the sinking of the
Lusitania because, though it refers
to the assurances that German subma
rines would not sink unresisting lin
ers, it does not reiterate them.
It was demonstrated that the Lusi
tania was wholly unarmed, but the
United States has since taken the po
sition that it considers a ship armed
for defensive purposes only and a ship
carrying no guns in the same class.
•.The German contention is that under
the new conditions of naval warfare
brought about by the advent of the
submarine, a merchant ship to be im
mune from attack should carry no
arms whatever. I

that feature was out of the hands of

Jhe presence of the marshals was

PURSUERS MOVING
IN TWO DIRECTIONS
One Column Hundred Miles
Southeast of Erzerum
Toward Kut-El-Mar
London, Feb. 21.—The Russians
have taken by storm the Turkish
towns of Mush and Achlat, south of
Erzerum, and are in close pursuit of
the Turkish army which is retiring
from Erzerum. The southern wing of
the Russian army is marching on
Dlarbekr, in the hope of opening up
the road to Syria. The northern wing
of the Russian army has captured the
town of Widje and is driving the
Turks back in the direction of GumiMh
Khaneh, which Is on the road to Treb
izond, while a large Russian force is
moving westward from Erzerum, with
the object of cutting off the Turkish
troops before they can reach a new
line of defense. Russian warships are
shelling the Turkish batteries along
the Black sea coast and are also hai
assing the retreating troops.
A dispatch from Petrograd reports
the Russians in possession of the en
tire Lake Van district, with the Turks
retreating southward and even evacu
ating the important city of Bitlis.
Lake Van lies 100 miles southeast
of Erzerum and Bitlis, a city of more
than 25,000 population, is southwest
of Lake Van, not more than ten miles
from the nearest point on the* lake
shore.
Bitlis is on the direct line of a force
pushing* from Lake Van toward Dlar

miles beyond whiph city runs the

by the Russians would cut Turkish
communications with Syria and ren
der hazardous the position of the Tur
kish forces facing the British down the
Tigris in Mesopotamia and likewise
that of their forces in Persia.
Turks Are Harassed.
The rapid advance of the Russian
forces in Turkish Armenia, following
the fall of Erzerum, is complicating
the task of the Turks in efforts to re
form their scattered forces.
From Tiflis, the Russian headquar
ters in the Caucasus, comes the report
today that two Turkish army corps
which were on their way to reinforo
the garrison at Erzerum turned back
when they learned that the fortress
had fallen. Assuming the accuracy
of this report, the Turks in eastern
Armenia have lost the prospect of im
portant help In extricating themselves
from what appears to be their perilous
position.
Unofficial accounts of the Russian
movements record an advance both to
the south and to the north, in the
former direction toward Dlarbekr and
the Bakdad railway fifty miles beyond
and in the latter in an effort to cut off
the retreat of the Turkish forces which
have been operating along the Black
sea coast.
Nearing Turk Seaport.
Petrograd dispatches indicate that
definite results are earliest expected
from the movement to the north,
where another Russian force is work
ing along the Black sea coast in *hc
direction of Trebizond, toward whicti
the Russian forces from Erzerum also
are pushing.
Far reaching results would follow
the success of the Russian thrust to
wards the south, it would appear, as
the cutting of the Bagdad railway
would sever communication with
Syria and point to the possibility of
close cooperation with the British
down the Tigris from Bagdad in oper
ations for the taking of that city.
Germans on Offensive.
The Germans are carrying on a
vigorous offensive movement againct
the British and French along the
Yser canal in Belgium, and havo
stormed 350 meters of a position. The
Germans, however, were prevented
from crossing the canal. In *.he
Champagne district, between the
Meuse and the Moselle rivers, the
French have bombarded successfully a
German position.
The Austro-Hungarians have report
ed the capture of an Italian position
northeast of Durazzo. This is the first
indication that the Italians were oper
ating so far north in Albania.
Four German seaplanes raided the
east and southeast coast of England
yesterday and dropped bombs on
Lowestoft and Walmer. Three per
sons were killed and one injured. The
raiders escaped.
Britons Repulsed.
Berlin declares today that a British
hand grenade attack on the positions
on the canal recently taken by the
Germans was repulsed, as was also
an attack along the Lens-Arras road.
The official statement likewise re

Aerial raids along the Franco-Bel

WRITES LETTERS.
New York, Feb. 21.—The police to
day expressed confidence that the pas
sion for notoriety shown by Jean
Crones, the Chicago anarchist who at
tempted to poison Archbishop Mun
delein and 300 other guests, would
result in his capture in the same man
ner as a similar desire for publicity
trapped Ignatius T. Lincoln, the Ger
man spy.
Crones' latest exploit was to call
up a local newspaper twice and an
nounce that he intended to stay in
New York until Thursday. His an
nouncement was coupled with a threat
against his brother, Paul Crones, on
account of an Interview Paul had giv
en to the newspaper.
Crones' love of writing boastful let
ters has inspired imitators. Two let
ters signed "Jean Crones," which
have been received by the police with
in the past twenty-four hours, are de
clared to be fakes, as neither the
writing nor the language are those of

RUSHED TO RELIEF CAMP8
AND QIVEN FOOD.
New Orleans, Feb. 21.—With four
steamers and numerous flatboats en
gaged in rescue work, reports from the
district flooded by the Mississippi
levee break at Buckridge were more
optimistic today.
Two steamers loaded with refugees
had reached Natchez today from the
neighborhood of Newellton.
Two other steamers were working
between Natchez and the Buckridge
crevasse, where flood victims are suf
fering most from exposure and lack of
food.
Reports from Newellton say a num
ber of parties with supplies have gone
into the back country in shallow draft
scows to sekrch for persons whom It
had been impossible to reach. By
using theBe boats many rescues were
expected.
Water from the constantly widen
ing crevasse at Buckridge was report
ed rapidly covering Tensas, Concor
dia, Franklin and Catahoula parishes.
The Mississippi river is mingling
with the Red river a short distance
below Vidalia and Ferriday, it was an
nounced, and the belief was- that by
the end of this week the pressure on
the Red river would force it much
higher. With the exception of the
Buckridge crevasse the Mississippi
rives levees continued to stand the
strain today. A horseback patrol is
being maintained from Buckridge to
below New Orleans.
Along the Atchafalya river before
Melville the crevasse was today re
ported to have widened considerably.
No effort to check the flow will be
attempted as the additional damage
will not be great. The only serious
losses in this district are reported by
tie and timber contractors. Back
water was reported rising very slowly,
and Melville and Krotz Springs were
being safe from serious flood.

Discusses American Ideal.
President Main, In his address, djf»|
cussed the American ideal. He tO0ks
up the questions of democracy and|
religion and handled them from ths
standpoint of their relations to OB«:l
another.
He said that democracy is a fupAa-l
mental element In religion, that p«0*|
pie are not conscious of its atmos*|
phere about them until it is taki
away. He thinks that democracy is
not fully realized as a foundation
Btone of the government, that It lf|
sjtill In the process of achievement
it is imminent but probably in the
future. i|
Critics declare democracy mean#!
vulgarity enthroned and maintain
that the nobility will form a sort of j|
an Invisible church.
The trouble with the church is that!
it, falls to recognize Christ as the In
terpreter of life and not merely as ft.
religious teacher. They have beett|
trying to reduce him to the siie of ono &
church instead of expanding him to J'-*
all the bounds of life. The treatment
of Jesus Christ has in a way don«'
more than anything else to put del
racy on trial, declared Dr. Main
jells What Church Is.
Rev. Malcolm Dana, in his paper *t
the 6:45 o'clock meeting, outlined tJ»*|
organization and divisions of the Con*4
gregational church. He said in part:
"A Congregational church, true to^
its historic origin and development,
a biblical church.
"It has always stood for the unf^t|
tered word as it has come increasing-^
ly hard to understand. Therefore It
welcomes all light and' investigation,
believing that the word of God isi
greater than any powers of criticism
and that the spirit of truth is best'
freed as the letter of truth is. discov
ered in all its history and meaning
and fact.
"Church freedom Is best illustratod'j
in a Congregational church. For' Ihiii
latter is under no ecclesiastical organ
