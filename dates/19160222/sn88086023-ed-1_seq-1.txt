BRIEFS FROM HOLMAN'S ADDRE.' S
ON GOOD ROADS.
Today the women of Oregon can vote and i is within
their power to build .such roads in our state a ur men
have never yet hatl the initiative to plan and ;...utice. 1
, hope they will grasp their opportunity.
The development of our state and the prosperity of our
citizens depend more today on good roads than upon
any other thing. Oregon does not need railroads so much
as she needs gootl roads.
In my opinion, every county in Oregon should have
prepared under the direction of a competent highway
engineer, a program for the development of a country
i road system which can be followed year after year.
It is no longer a question of how steep grades we can
travel, but how steep grades we can travel economically.
It is no longer a question of how short a turn we can make,
but how short a turn we can make safely.
It is no longer a question of the lowest first cost of a
surface we can maintain in our roads but of the lowest ul
timate cost at which we can maintain the surface on our
! roads.
True economy demands the holding of all "expense '
items to the absolute minimum, while it also demands that
adequate expenditure chargeable to "investments" shall
; be made so that the ordinary demands of our daily com
merce may be prosecuted with facility and convenience.
Umatilla county can successfully solve the road prob
lems which are common to every county in the state, and
she will obtain for herself, and for us who wish her an
her people well, that high state of development and pros- il
perity which she richly deserves.

Umatilla county will vote at the spring primaries upon a

purposes. This was decided last evening at a joint meeting of
the executive committee of the Umatilla County Good Roads
association and of the special road committee of the Pendleton
commercial association, following the general meeting earlier
in the evening.
Upon motion of Col. J. H. Raley it was decided to ask Coun
ty Judge Marsh to name seven representative citizens from the
