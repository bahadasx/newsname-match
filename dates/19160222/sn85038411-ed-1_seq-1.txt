SSO Reward
To the person or persons gather
ing evidence leading to the arrest
and conviction of the firebug or
firebugs responsible for the series
of incendiary lires in the Allison
Hill district, the Telegraph will pay
a reward of fifty dollars.
Relieving that the safety and pro- j
teetion of the people of Allison Hill!
depend upon the immediate arrest and j
conviction of the firebug who has been
burning sclioolhouses, factories, stables
and other buildings in the Allison Hill
residential and industrial district, the
Telegraph to-day offers a reward of
SSO to tlie person or persons gathering '
evidence which will lead to the arrest j
Mid conviction of the incendiary.
It is hoped that City Council, the l
School Board and individuals will add
to this sum sufficient to induce private
agencies to prosecute a work so neces
sary to the protection of life and prop
erty—a work which the local police
force up to the present time has been
unable to do successfully.
Hill People In Terror
Ever since the outbreak of .the first
series of incendiary fires a month ago
when three sclioolhouses were set
n blaze the residents of the Hill have
been living in constant terror that a
new outbreak might occur.
Over Saturday and Sunday a second
series of fires, not so serious as the
first, because of prompt action on the
part of the city fire department, point
ed conclusively to the hand of the fire
fiend.

President Flayed in
Verse by Owen Wister
Sferial to the Telegraph
Philadelphia, Pa., Feb. 22. Owen
Wister, the distinguished author,
gave out the following poem for pub
lication yesterday:
TO WOODROW WILSON":
FEB. 22, I*l6.
Not even if 1 possessed your twist in
speech,
Could T make any (fit for use) fit
you;
You've wormed yourself beyond de
scription's reach:
Truth if she touched you would be
come untrue.
Satire has scared a host of evil fames.
Has withered Emperors by her
fierce lampoons:
History has lashes that have flayed
the names
Of public cowards, hypocrites, pol
troons;
You go ityimune. Cased in your self
esteem.
The next world cannot scathe you*
nor can this:
No fact can stab through your com
placent dream.
Nor present laughter, nor the fu
ture's hiss.
But if its fathers did this land con
trol.
Dead Washington would wake and
blast your soul.
—Owen Wister.
