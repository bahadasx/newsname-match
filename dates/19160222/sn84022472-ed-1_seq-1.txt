FOOD SUPPLY IN
HIGH SCHOOL NOT
ENOUGH FOR ALL
Lively Dispute With Hurt
ling Pie Among Diver-
sions at Feeding Time.
More than 1,200 boys andirls, stu
dents at . the., new Bridgeport High
school, attended the exercises dedica
tory of the opening of the scjhool lunch
room yesterday. ' According to .tale
told by the pupils today, the order of
exercises was something l'.ke this:
; I. Opening rush of hungry pu
pils to the lunch counters.
2. Repulse of pupils by servers,
, '-who demanded "checks."
B. . Second assault by pupils this
. - time, on 'checks" dlsburser.
r 4. Sudden failing of supplies with
i ' " pupils stur holding "checks."
-i 5. " Lively' encounter between two
. , ' ... . senior boys.
6. Dismissal of school , an ,hour
.' ' ! early that pupils might eat.
!,It was. a festive occasion; - say the
High' school ' boys- and girls who took
part.- It . 3vaa'-buuud..to-(eed , .the
school ti two groups, one section hold
ing the fort from 11:45 to 12:15, and
the other from 2:30 to 1. o'clock. The
scheme fliwered, it Is said, with much
confusion resulting.
Ihe first group of 'H.ils stormed the
lunch, counters At 11:45:47 with a di
versified but . insistent' demand for
food.- They were informed that it was
a "Pay-as-you -enter" lunch room and
officials weren-t- taking any - chances
of having patrons walk out on them.
tn other words, -'you'd have . to buy
checks which could be exchanged for
food. - - - ' ' . ;
A bright young manwho sold checks
became the storm center a few min
utes later. He had a nice time of it
and sold checks by the bushel.
The first lunch period was nearly
over when . the, ravenous appetites of
the pupils showed disastrous results in
the larder. .When the second bunch
of pupils came down and bought their
checks, they discovered that the food
supply was away short of the demand.
There was' quite, a tumult in the lunch
room for the second half hour. :
The activities came to' a : climax
when a senior boy stepped into. a. cor
ner to enjoy a bit of pastry that he'd
managed -to corral':-; : His first bite disclosed-
that there was a" Wooden core
therein, and it spoiled the pastry ut
terly, for all ordinary- purposes. -
The resourceful senior, however,
didn't enter a complaint: nor did; he
become peeved. Instead; he rolled th
tidbit into a compact body and hurled
if' with unerring aim across the length
of the lunch room. - It found its mark
iit another ; student's nose. It was a
bullseye, or nose. ;
The stricken student immediately
nicked 'out the marksman and an, ex
change of rights and lefts enlivened
the proceedings for a few minutes.
Teachers Interfered and tne pupus
were sent to the principal', soffice for
disciplinary measures. , . :
Irincioal Simonds decided, when
the food suppply failed, that the hun-
arrv. ones must be fed. Accordingly,
he ordered school dismisssed at 1:30
o'clock, instead of the regular hour.
2:30; : , ; f
Officials of the school are planning
new arrangements for the lynch room
so that several hundred pupils may be
f ew di thin -the limited -times assigned
as lunch periods. . There aren't enough
seats, under, the present arrangement.

Boiler of Locomotive Explodes As Special Train
Runs Into Rear End of Fast Connecticut River
Special, Stalled By Accident Flagman Sacri
fices Life In Vain Attempt To Halt Onrushing
Train- Freight Train, Paralleling Wrecked
Passengers Coaches, Involved In Disaster.
Three trains were wrecked and heaped in an inde-J
scribable jumble shortly before 11 o 'clock this morning,
near the Indian River Bridge, Milf or d. J
At least six persons were killed. More than two
score were injured. , : f
Local No. 5, an accommodation train, crashed into thef
rear of the Connecticut River Special, No. 79, Alm&st at j
the samelninute, a freight train, rumbling along with an
fendless string qf heavily loaded cars, sideswiped, the two
passenger trains and 11 three were piled in a mass of J
mingled freight, splintered cars and smoke and steam.' i
Yells of fear-maddened passengers when the local hit the J
rear of the special train were followed almost immediately by
the despairing and heart-rending screams of J women, which i
mingled with the hone the less piercing screams of the men.
Three of the trainmen are dead. Engineer Curtis and Fire-j
vi-iti. . McGinnis". of: he'Cbnaecticut River train were imprisoned!
in their: cab. They had no chance for their lives when tne
freight -Tush!6 toward, tbem.
ea to ne tne oiner. - .
Accordiirur to eye witnesses, the big
special train- had stepped because of a
broken!: air'', pipe. The flagman ran
back to protect his train from Local
No, 5, which had Just left Woodmont.
He was-a hero. ' Mindful only of the
tei-rible calamity that he knew was
about -Jto' occur, he. rushed headlong
toward the oncoming -local, didn't try
to step aside, and was cut to pieces,
wildly Waving his flag in the effort to
have the engineer prevent what h
knew, to be a terrible collision.
The local struck the rear of the spe
cial. There was a tremendous grind
ing as the wood cars of the local,
borne on by '.their momentum, and
two or three pulled by the engine, ap
peared to try to -burrow through the
big special.
Instead the local was( smashed to
pieces as if it had struck a stone
wall.,. The cars of the special were
of steel.
Appearing to slightly rebound, the
engine of the local a steam one
hurtled into the air and tumbled
down the bank, which .was a score of
feet,, at a great slant.
When what .-seemed an echo or tne
sxinding and smashing came, in the
collision of the freight train, two of the
coaches directly ' behind the engine
of the local; separated from' It ana
from - each other . and went rolling
down the embankment. . ' "
The cries of the Imprisoned passen
gers were fearful. Caught as if in a
barrel .rolling down hill, they were
carried end over end to the bottom
of the slope. Bodies were thrown
together, women' grabbed men - and
men grabbed women in wild attempts
to save themselves ana aozens were
injured..
The sight of them crawling rrom
the windows, from the broken places
and from the doors, was an appalling
and never-to-be-forgotten one, - Kleea-
lng, with broken limbs and many with
almost unrecognizable faces, tney
pleaded" for medical aid. .. '
PHYSICIANS RUSH
IN SPECIAL TRAIN MOTORS :
ON TROLLEYS AND OMNIBUSES
When the news of the wreck was
flashed to Bridgeport about noon,
railroad officials of this city telephon
ed to all the available physicians and
surgeons in the city. ; More than a
score rushed into their, hats- and
coats, hurriedly took their pack and
speeded' to the railroad station, where
a speclaV train was being made up.
The train - consisted of one bag
gage coach and a passenger coach,
drawn by a steam engine. Some of
the . physicians, who had not automo
biles at their service and went to the
station on foot and in trolley cars
missed the train.
The special speeded to the scene
of the wreck and there great assis
tance was given.
Physicians connected with the
Bridgeport hospital went in an auto
mobile, to the scene.
The politician's idea of reform is
spending money investigating a sub
ject, meanwhile hoping that the peo
ple will forget they wanted it.

In the -meantime, the sceiie of the
tracks baffled description;. The hiss
of steam, the screams of women, and j
cries of those' with limbs shattered
and the shouts of those who had run !
to the wreck made a Bedlam.
The steel cars of the special were
piled together. , Spread over them and
in a big pile at the rear .were those of
the local, , On top of all were littered
tremendous quantities of freight. -" j
It was impossible to ' tell, at first,
even approximately how many were
hurt. Those who were able, crawled)
from beneath cars, freight and beams;
that covered them, and those who!
were less seriously hurt tried to'helpj
others. ...
Train No. 79 had an electric motor, 1
but aa far as known none was a suf-
ferer through electric burns, i !
The boiler" of No. 5 exploded. Likej
a mine tearingto pieces a ship, the!
explosion tossed wreckage into thoj
air. ' - X".i
One of the unusual features of the
wrecK was mat aa soon as il , oc
curred, a blinding and almost im
penetrable dust covered the scene.
It was impossible at first to sea the
injured,- but soon girls, women and
men ' emerged with cut. faces, fear-
filled eyes, moaning for the most
part.- . . . : I
The two passenger trains had been
traveling to New York. The special
was made up at New Haven to take
'theplaoe of the regular Sprlngfleld-
New York train. The freight train
was traveling west. ,
Simon Lake, who ,was at the scene
said: "If would have been a much
more terrible wreck' had the oars on
the Connecticut River special not been
of steel." - -
One woman is dead. - Two men be
