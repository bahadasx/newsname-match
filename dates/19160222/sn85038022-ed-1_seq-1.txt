IISKL & &0ONRAD . , , f WM 43,
Pursuant to a call Issued and signed
by tho requisite number of City Pap
pics, a special session and n caucus
meeting wcro hold Monday night In
tho Council Chamber for the purpose
of considering somo Important mat
ters. The call was amending two ordi
nances passed at tho last mooting of
Council nnd to procuro an assessor'!
book, and tho first business was thu
amending of tho ordlnnnoo relative to
tho Improving of Second street from
tho Kast side of Union to tho west
side of Carmel, which was to hnvo
been done by reconstructing it with
asphalt. Tho ordlnnnco was amend
ed by changing tho word "asphalt"
and Inserting "vitrified brlok." This
change was made In order to get bids
on both asphalt and brick for that
thoroughfare, several members claim
ing that n number of property owners
along tho line to bo improved de
sired brick, nnd of course, it was only
fair to get bids on both for tho bene
fit of those who will hnvo to foot
the bill. Tlio amendment was adopt
ed by a unanimous vote.
Tlio next business wns nn amend
ment to the now "linuor" license or
dinance. It Is proposed to strike out
the 4',. gnllons In thu original ordi
nance and Insert one cnw.
The city assessor's book wos the
next special session to bo disposed
of, nnd the procuring of ono was
placed In tho hands of tho ways and
moans committee. At this juncture
.Member Thomas of the First ward,
arose and asked tho mayor whether
or not City Assessor James Stewart,
who was elected by the new Council,
wiis n resident of Maysville or of Cin
cinnati, ns ho bail beard that Mr.
Stewart was a resident of Ohio, and If
so, ho was not eligible to hold office
In Kentucky. This had tlio same ef
fect on tho quiet meeting of Council
ns some one who had lot a monkey
wrench get away from Mini and slide
Into a sot of gear wheels on n rapid
ly running machine, for It was the
moans' of breaking up the special
meeting, ns Member Huston question
cd tho legality of Buch n proceedure,
as Council had not been called to con
sidor that question.
In order to get nt tho matter, the
spcclnl session was adjourned and the
members went into a caucus meeting,
pledging themselves to stand by the
business transacted caticusly nt the
regular meeting. It wns caucused to
leave the matter of Investigating Mr.
Stewart's place of residence and
whether or not ho had voted In Ohio
to tho ways and means committee wltli
Mayor Lee and tho city attorney added
and what action they took would be
sanctioned nt tho regular meeting of
the City Council. ,
As this wns about to end the meet
ing, City Attorney Calhoun made a
statement to the caucusers that if they
would express their willingness to
back lilm up, ho would draw up an
ordinance creating a sinking fund for
tho city, In order that tho street pav
Ing bonds could bo disposed of to the
various banks of this city. IIo cx
plained that the city would bo com
pelled to pay for tho street Intersec
tions of the proposed Improvement;)
and about $3,C00 worth of property
that was not worth the Improvements,
and In order to make a saving of a
considerable amount to tho city and
property holders a sinking fund, to
which tho city would add 11,500 an
nually for ten years, with a slight ad
dltton to take caro of tho Interest,
would Insuro tho safety of tho banks
and they would buy the street pav
Ing bonds, nnd when tho work was
dono the contractors could be paid
In cash, thus enabling them to bid on
tho work and bo sura of no bad-debts
In doing this he thought tho saving
would bo from 1G to 20 conts a squaro
yard lower than tlio bids last year
He was Instructed to go ahead with
the ordinance, nnd the Council to a
man would sustain It.
lleforo a motion could bo muilo to
icq u I io Chief Muckcy to ucrow up tho
prcHs table to keep tho wnbblo out of
It and build a fence around tho press
boys to kcop some of the members
