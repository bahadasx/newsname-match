. WAR DEBT
British Financier Declares John Bull in No
Lunger of Being Crushed by Obli
gations Caused by Carrying
on Conflict .
By CHAS. P. STEWART.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Feb. 22 Even if Eng'and
Ehould end the war with a debt of 5.
flOO, 00,000 pounds (approximately $23;
000,000,000) the .burden would not be
crushing, according to Lord Inchcape,
the English financier and statesman,
here todaj.
Such a load, said his lordship at a
National Provincial Bank of England
stockholders' lueetin over which he
presides, would mean an annual charge
of only 300,000,000 pounds (about $1,
fOO,000,COO) reckoning 5 per cent in
terest, with a 1 per cent sinking fund
To this his lordship added an esti
mated 100,000,000 pounds (Sou0,000,O00)
annually in pensions. Before the war,
he remarked, the country's annual ex
penditures were 200,000,000 pounds
($1,000,000,000) making the total:
Interest and sinking fund on basis
of estimated 5,000,000 debt: 300,000,-
000 pounds annually.
Estimated pensions, 100,000,000
pounds annually.
Fixed charges on per-war basis, 200,
000,000 pounds annually.
Or a total of 000,000,000 pounds an
nually. Present English taxation, continued
Lord Inchcape, is bringing in nearly
400,000.000 pounds annually. He ex
plained that this would mean another
200,000.000 pounds would have to be
provided every year and expressed
the opinioa that this could be done
either by 'additional taxes or by a
reduction in extravagant expenditures
not only private but public."
His lordship appeared to think
J2,".,000. 000,000 debt a possibility, but
about the maximum.

SESSION OF
S0L0NSIS
CONCLUDED
Law Makers Wind Up Work and Adjourn
After Running Five Weeks; Finishing
Touches Put on Proceedings
This Morning
STRONG ANTI-USURY
LAW IS ENACTED
Grady County Members in Both Houses
Vote for Measure; Suffrage Af end
ment to Be Submitted; Summa
ry of Bills Passed
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., Feb. 22.
After being In session a little over fivo
weeks, the state legislature finally
completed its work this morning and
adjourned at noon today. The reai
business of the ression was wound up
last night, the proceedings this morn
ing being confined to the signing of
bills by the presiding officers and
other formalities.
At last night's session the anti-usury
bill and the registration bill were fin
ally passed. The usury law, which is
regarded as a strong one, received the
votes of the Grady county members
in both the house and senate.
Anti-Usury Act.
The salient features of the anti-usury
law, as finally enacted, are as follows:
Section 1 re-enacts th? present law. .
and proviues that the debtor may pica
as a setoff or counterclaim double the
amount of Interest charged or collected
when suit is brought on a loan con
tract. Also it repeals that part of the
law which requires demand to be made
as a precedent to bringing suit to re
cover penalties.
Section 2 provides the manner In
which the debtor, without bringing any
suit, may recover usurious interest
paid, or charged, by providing that
the debtor may tender to the holder of
any usurious contract the amount o'
money actually received by him, less
the entire amount of interest charg
ed, reserved or collected and on fail
ure of the holder of the usurious con
tract to accept such tender within 24
hours operates as a satisfaction and
cancellation of the entire dobt. The
section further provides that in case
no tender is made and suit is brought
the debtor may go into court and de
posit the amount of money actually
borrowed, less double the amount of
usurious interest charged or collected,
tog'.-ther wtih the cost, and it this is'
not accepted by the plaintiff in the
case, it operates as a cancellation and
satisfaction of the debt. It also jro
vides that the act does not repeal or
modify any of the provisions of the
negotiable instrument law.
By section 3 it is provided that where
a usuriou ontract is made and trans
ferred the person making said contract
is made liable to the pealty provided
in the act.
In section 4 there is a provision that-'
no suit upon a usurious contract en
tered into after the passage of the act
of $300 or less shall be filed in court
unless an affidavit is also filed! that no
usurious interest has been charged or
collected and without such affidavit no
process of the court can be issued. If
on trial of the case it is shown usury
ha3 been charged or collected, it is
mandatory for the court to dismiss the
appeal at cost of the plaintiff.
Section 5 provides that all state
banks shall make quarterly reports to
the bank commissioner ot all conL-acts
upon which a usurious rate of interest
has been charged. Such reports are t-
be published in the annual report of
the bank commissioner. It further pro.
vides that when such report shows that
any bank is violating the law the com
missioner shall report the violation to
the governor, who shall order the com
missioner to bring suit through the
office of the attorney general to can
cel tho charter of such offending bank.
Among the other important measures
enacted by the special session were the
following:
Other Measures Enacted.
Provied for establishment of twine
factory at penitentiary.
