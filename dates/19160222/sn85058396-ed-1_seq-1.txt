LODGE HONORS
FIRST PRESIDENT
Senator Pays High Tribute to
Government That George
Washington Founded.
WISDOM WAS LASTING
Foresight of Lincoln and Great
Continental Leaders of
Permanent Benefit.
Morristown, N. J., Feb. 22. United
States Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of
Massachusetts, In a speech delivered
here today, before the Washington as
sociation, paid tribute to the popular
government which Washington found
ed and which, he asserted, has been
lost.
Senator Lodge said that when tho
opinions of Washington and Lincoln
on government by tho people were
quoted, "we were told that Lincoln
lived fifty years ago, and Washington
in a period of great antiquity and al
though they were undoubtedly remark'
able men in their day, they hardly can
be compared with the master minds
engaged In undoing their work and,
moreover, that s every thing had altered
since they flourished.
'"I have said frequently and I will
venture to say again that while I am
far from thinking that all the wisdom
died with our forefathers, I am per
fectly certain that all the wisdom
was not born yesterday.
"Every thinking man," he continued,
"of any age Is disposed, If not eager,
to welcome new Ideas, but the condi
tion of his doing so is that the Idea
shall bo really new as well as bene
liclal "
He Issued a warning to the peace-at-any-prlce
advocates and In conclusion
said:
"The men of Washington's day who
were for peace at any price frankly
because they'wero afraid and cared
more for money than aught else, are

MACHINE GUNS
LINE EAST FRONT
Every Mile of Terrain Bristles
With Deadly Man Destroyers .
Multitudes of Rapid
Firero.
Pinsk, Russia, by courier to Berlin.
Feb. 21, via London, Fob. 22, 11 '30
a. m. The mildest winter of decades
along the present German lines in
the east has been an important factor
in rcnuering mule, in lh,is section ai
least, all Russian efforts to regain
their lost territory. An Associated
Press correspondent, the first to have
the opportunity to view the "machine
gun front" In and about tho Pripet
swamps where the Teutons took up
their positions in Soptember and Oc
tober, has Just returned from a trip
along several miles of tho swampy
fighting line.
Front Bristles With Guns.
Every mile of this front fairly bris
tles with deadly machine guns,
v. hlch covor every inch of terrain.
Though tho correspondent had no
moans of ascertaining how many men
defend the Pinsk sector, tho multitude
of rapid firing guns gives the Impres
sion that even a smaller number ot
men should bo able to hold the line
indefinitely. In addition to the guns,
millions of running feet of barbed
wire entanglements transforming each
village and house Into a veritable for
tress, render the German positions
from layman's standpoint, impregna
blewhich the military authorities
claim that they are.
This Impression Is heightened by
the fact that the swamps, from two
to ten miles wide In the region of
Pinsk, have not once been frozen over
entirely during the winter. In fact
the mild weather with the resultant
open swamp land between the Ger
man and Russian lines has made ex
traordinary fortification unnecessary
thus far. Probablv nowhere on any
front Is the term "stationary warfare"
moro applicable than in the PIusK ais
trict where lonoly outpoBts in block
houses erected on tiny Islands in the
swamp lands and roving patrols give
the only real touch of fighting.
The German lines at Pinsk protrude
farthest east of any along the whole
front from Baltic to Galicla. They
protect In a semi-oval form. The
greatest danger to the forces at
Plnpk, therefore, is a flanking move
ment from tho north the swamps af
ford protection from the south. In
consequence tho northern lines have
been made extremely strong. Not
only Is every yard of this front fenced
In with entanglements 100 to 120 feet
wide, but there are supporting points
at very' abort Intervals which are
veritable fortresses in themselves
They are surrounded by star shaped
barricades of wire.
Each of these supporting points is
sub-divided Into barricaded sections,
with bomb proof shelters and with
uiachlno guns to fire along both sldea

of each point of the stars. As a final
precaution each supporting point is
surrounded by a single wire, stretched
knee high, on which hang ten pairs
of empty bottles, which clink the
alarm the moment the wire Is touched
by any person who approaches.
Crack Cavalry Regiments.
A novel feature of the German de
fense in this section Is that the troops
are composed almost entirely of crack
cavalry regiments, numbering high
nobles among their officers. A short
time ago they would have scoffed at
the Idea of being dismounted, but now
they live cheerfully in part or wholly
underground, riding their horses only
for sport in' Improvised hippodromes.
w-The lot of the troops on this north
ern flank of the front, however, is
happier than that of those east and
south of Pinsk, for they have been
able to entrench themselves in the
dunes bordering the swamps, while
in the other sections It has been nec
essary to construct a largo part of
th defenses almost In the water it
self or at the best on marshy land.
Russian Series of Forts.
Paralleling the Strumen river south
of the city, runs a narrow dike built
by the Russians, either to hold back
the flood waters or to serve as the
bed for a projected railroad. This
dike Is but a few feet above the fast
running river on one side and the
vast swamp on tho other and has been
converted into a series of tiny forts,
with machine guns commanding every
Russian position In tho wido angle.
The water front line ot Pinsk itself,
past which the PIna river flows, more
than any other creates the Impression
of being a "machine gun front."
Trenches havo been dug where the
unpaved sidewalks used to be. There
is scarcely a house that has not Deeii
fortified with sand bags and earth
against the Russian attack which nev
er comes.
Germans Fortify Island.
Near the city, out in the swamp,
lies a small island which Is the near
est point to tho Russians. The Ger
mans have built a staging to the Isl
and and havo fortified the Island it
self. On it they have Installed troops
commanded by the rulor of a German
state, who lives unostentatiously In a
dilapidated villa.
Tho wholo German side of the
swamp to a depth from half a milo
to a mile is criss-crossed with staging
running to every hummock of solid
land large enough to hold a block
house, machine guns and men.
Possibly on account of tho combina
tion of dampness, the unfrozen condi
tion of the swamp and the extraordi
nary Gorman defenses, or possibly be
cause of lack of adequate artillery,
the Russians have made only a few
half hearted efforts to push back the
Germans from Pinsk. They limit
themselves to patrol scouting. Occa
sionally shells are fired but they In
variably fall short, striking in the
swamp.
Tho slightly elevated position of
Pinsk gives the Germans a dual ad
vantage. They are able to observe all
Russian movements while it is prob
able that with the higher water of the
spring, the Russians in the lower po
sition will be flooded out.
