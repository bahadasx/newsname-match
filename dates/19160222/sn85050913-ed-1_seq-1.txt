.^Yeatji Service as Congrega
tional Minister.
A recent Issue of the Spencer
News contains the following com
mendable item in relation to the
work of Rev. J. 0. Thrush, who was
for eleven years pastor of the Con
gregatlonal church in this city and
whose friends here are limited only
by the circle of his acquaintance:
Twenty-five: years ago tomorrow
on the ninth of February, Rev. John
O. Thrush, the beloved pastor of the
Congregational church of this city,
came to Spencer-and to his first pas
torate. Ftor eight years Jie earnest
ly and efficiently served the Spencer
church, and then went to Webster
City, where he remained for eleven
years. In 1910 he was' recalled to
thb Spencer cburfch, yielding only to
the insistent demands .of his former
parishioners, after refusing offers
from larger and stronger churches.
During his first pastorate here,
the beautiful church building1 was
erected, and during his second the
new addition was built and the
whole structure artistically redecor
ated.
Many of those whom h« christen
ed during his first pastorate, he has,
in his' second, united with the
church. He has so guided the lives
of many Spencer children so that
they have become strong men and
women. The small church of the
nineties has grown Into a force for
good in this city, and his influence
and earnest, whole-hearted endeav
or has playedpo small pert in the
great work. In all departments of
church life, the influence of Mr.
.yhjush i* felt. ,^.a Sup^yrchooi
teacher- and leader, hi? claa*~sayhe
is without as equal in binding to
gether the different departments of
the Sunday school he exerts a rare
degree of tact and superior wisdom.
As an interpreter of the gospel he
is reverent yet broad minded and
modern in his views. The Christian
ity which he preaches and urges
forcefully upon men, he lives.
In liis life as a pastor, ho has re
ceived unfailing inspiration and help
from his wife, who is a woman of
culture and charm
Yard of Radishes.?*
Sheldon Bros, grocery ha* just re
ceived a unique shipment of seeds
fof- garden making which would en
able the greenest amateur to plant
seeds and make a garden. These
seeds do not come by the packet,
loose and ready for dropping care
fully by hand into rows, as seeds
have come for the last fifty years.
No, indeed. One may go out in the
morning and plant a yard of rad
ishes before breakfast—or for that
matter, several yards One might1
almost go-to a grocery and ask for 10
yards of beans tor planting:, for all
these seeds now may be had in this
manner. Long narrow stripB of pa
per glued together with fish glue
hold the seeds methodically placed
therein, exactly one Inch apart. The
paper com« in a roll—for radishes
—forty feet in length, and all that
is necessary is to prepare the ground
and make a furrow one inch deep.
Lay in your strip of paper the length
of the row and cut it off. Cover,
and the row is planted. The new
contrivance is one of the most clever
ever seen. And easy! Who could
not have a garden!
Gets Contract at Algona.
W. J. Zitterell has secured the
contract for the erection of the fine
new concrete factory building to be
put up in Algona by the Algona Ice
Cream ft Candy Co. The structure
will be two stories with basement,

Work will be commented as soon as
the weather is favorable with the
hope of completing it by Au& 1st."

'•••."'Wgy
The Webster City squad proved
their ability to "come back" after
the farcical but exhausting contest
the night before on the ^ubbard
"cigar-box", court. France put up
his usual classy exhibition, and
Spratt was the other Webster City
luminary, darting to all places on
the floor with lightning-like speed
and fighting every minute.
The Clarion guards were perhaps
the best brought here by any visit
ing team this year, and the whole
team was well balanced and aggres
sive. The pluck and gameness of the
Clarion forward, who played most
of the game with a strained ankle,
deserves special mention.
The first half ended with the score
resting at 16 to 10. This ratio re
mained about the same throughout,,
the points gathered in the final'ses
sion being 22 and 17 for the re
spective teams.

Colored Singer at the Congregation
al Church Meetings is Rarely
1
A great attraction at the Gordon
meetings at the Congregational
church is the Ringing of Mr. Albert
Edward Greenl$vf. He is a graduate
of tfce copBervatjry. of music cf Fisk
Univor*i\& dnfr ot ih»: great schools
of the American Missionary Associa
tion In the south. He was a mem
ber «f the Fisk Singers of the cele
brated class of 1901. Most of his
work has been done in the Dominion
of Canada. In Winnipeg he had
charge of the Young Men's Christian
Association Glee Club, was leader of
the Choral Society of the First Bap
tist church, and was choir leader
and soloist in other churohes in the
city. Mr. Greenlaw holds the dis
tinction of being the best known and
the highest paid church singer in
Canada.
Mr. Greenlaw's is that rare voice,
a tuneful bass. It is splendidly
trained and is under the most per
fect control. His repertoire includes
religious and concert numbers. As
an aid to the Congregational meet
ings too much can not be said of Mr.
Greenlaw and his voice, both as a
drawing power to gather an audi
ence and in its effectiveness as a
part of the gospel influences of the
campaign. His voice has been term
ed majestic. His shading and con
trol are perfect. He is a vocal or
chestra.
Webster City people will be in
terested to know that Mr. Greenlaw
is a composer of note as well as a
singer. Among the songs that bear
his name on the title page are
Where the Sweetest Flowers Grow,"
Childhood Days," and "Memory's
Flowers." Mr. Greenlaw's songs
may be had this week at the Con
gregational church.
Barn Burns.
The lire department was called
out Friday night about 7:30 o'clock
by a big blaze back of the John But
ler residence property on east Bank
street, near the flowing well. An
old barn at the rear of the lot has
been used for a storage building by
the owner, who is absent in Nebras
ka, and. was found to be wrapped in
flames by the time the fire wagon
reached the seene. The family of
John Gage occupy the dwelling
which was unharmed by the sparks
from the fire. Some water was
thrown upon the flames, but the en
tire bain and its contents were lost.
The cause of the fire appears t« be
a mystery.
Miss Tennie Killingsworth of this
city and Mr. A. J. Jackson of Dixie,
Okla., were united in marriage Sat

ren parsonage, Rev, E. R. Baber of

Dr. Kaynor practiced medicine in

Seven children were given them,

A Seal Alarm.
Friday night at the Isis theater
little thing happened which could
not have been better timed had it
been part of the mechanism of the
picture machine. The film being
shown upon the curtain at 7:30
o'clock was of a city fire and just
as the policeman rushed to the fire
box and pressed the button—the
.Webster City fire whistle began its
siren call! For a moment nearly ev
eryone in the audience thought the
whistle a part of the picture and
then it dawned upon them that a
real fire was in progress somewhere
in the city.

Lehigh, Feb. 19.—-At 6:30 a. mi
yesterday Abraham Bargar, who re
sides three miles north of here, shut
off his alarm clock, got up, dressed
and went down stairs. Breakfast was
not yet ready and Mr. Bargar filled
his pipe with his favorite tobacco,
went out of doors to inhale the Iresh
morning breeze, returned into the
house in time to receive birthday
greetings from the family of his
nephew. All this seems uninter
esting, and it would be so, only for
one reason. Mr. Bargar was 100
years old yesterday. For one cen
tury he ".a8 been permitted to waken
each morning, look upon the world,
go through the day's work1 and go to
rest once more, always sure of aris
ing at exactly the same time next
morning, to repeat the performances
of the day.
There were days when Mr. Bar
gar got up, did the chores and then
after a hearty breakfast, would trav
el out into the fields to gather his
living from,the soil. But the infirm
ities of age have set in, and now Mr.
IJargar rests, awaiting the end which
•will soon come, after which he will
he rewarded for his century o£ liv
ing on this earth.
Born in 1816, shortly after the
close of the war of 1812, trouble
some times were witnessed by Mr.
Bargar in his youth. The war with
Mexico, during the time of Texas'
independence, also happened during
the youth of the Webster county pi-.

Mr. Carl was at home in the south

but had not heard it. Many others
in th4t section of tbwn didn't hear
it. It is rather peculiar that the
