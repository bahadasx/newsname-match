WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.?Every
agency of the American government
paused today to pay homage to the
memory of George Washington in the
national capitol, which bears his
name.
President Wilson, Secretary Lansing,
Ambassador Jtaerand and oth
er national llgures gathered at a ee'e
bration at Continental memorial hall
under the auspicefl of associated patriotic
societies.
Iloth houses of Congress suspended
business, while Senator Johnson, of
Maine, and Representative Hahcr. of
California, read General Washington's
farewell address with its phrases
warning against "tnsidous wiles
of foreign Influence," "mischiefs of
foreign intrigues" and "the Impostures
of pretended patriotism."
The farewell address has been read
in Congress for generations but probably
never before were Washington's
words so closely applied to present
day conditions.

United States Henator Henry Cabot

here today issued n warning to the
"peace at any prico" advocates, when
he said:
"The men of Washington's day, who
were for peace at any price frankly
because they were afraid nnd~ eared
more tor money than aught else, are
forgotten, but the name of Washington
is enshrined and reverenced by all nations.
Let us not depart from his teachings
or from his hifili conception of a

HUNTINGTON, Fch. 22?Reports
now being received at the headquarters
of William F. Hite, candidate for
the Republican nomination for
United States Senate, rrom points:
throughout the state and In every:
county, bring cheering news of pleas-'
lng progress being made. In the
northern, as well as In the southern.
section of West Virginia, many of j
the old "wheel horses" of the party [
are rallying beneath the Cabell couuI?
ty candidate's banner, while among
the younger element his popularity
and support is being strongly assured.
This race bids fair to be one
of the. most tntersting every wltnesa
erl In West Virginia. Both of the
candidates are succssful men, men |
of high honor and Integrity; of equal i
Importance to the political party to [
which they hold allcgtance, and it Is I
evident that In this one instance at |
least the state will see a clear-cut. j
clean and determined contest for:
nomination to high offlco.
Manager.C. L. Topping, of the Hlto
headquarters here, on Saturday had
the following to Bay concerning the
Hite eandidacy:
"Without boasting, I am agreeably
lTmrines nf the assurance of strong
support coming: In from all over the;
state. Mr.. Mite's Is not a candidacy
of the sensational order; it was not
expected that he would be accepted
with a whoop and a hurrah and made
the 'leading candidate' at first shothut
now that his letter of announcement
has had time to soak Into the
