those of :i lawyer, and if he were'

Senator Mapp took sharp issue with

duties of the enforcement oilicer would
be executive, rather than legal, n-d
directing his attention to frequent criti-i
cisms leveled at the Legislature he-;
cause of its alleged fondness for:

adopt the amendment would. he
thought, bring down upon the General
Assembly the opprobrium of the eti-1

"It has gone abroad." said Senator'
Wendenburg. in reply, "that this olV.ce'

i Whether the new bill will be ac
ceptable to I 'resident Wilson has not
been indicated, but the committee be
lieves its plait will override every ob
ject inn to the substitution of the Na
tional Guard for the continentals, niul
j that Congress has full legal authority
j for its accomplishment.
lo complete the committee's com
promise with the President on the con
tinental army, the bill will authorize
the increase of the regular army to a
total pence strength of I t7.000, by ndd
| mg ton regiments of infantry, four
I regiments of ticl<i artillery, fifty-two
j companies of coast artillery, fifteen
J companies of ens inters, ami four aero
j .stiuadrons. This is the exact regular
army program mapped out l.y former
Secretary Garrison before the unfavor
able- reception of the continental army
scheme lei! io his resignation. It
represents also a concession by Chair
man llav, who urged previously- reach
ing the same total strength by"recruit
j ing present regiments up to full war
strength and adding to the field artil
lery arm.
Cndcr the tentative bill, the regular
army would have an organization

; "ion in war tune, and a reserve pro
vision will be included designed to pro
vince annually 7.",.000 reservists, obli
