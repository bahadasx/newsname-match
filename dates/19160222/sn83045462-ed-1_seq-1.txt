HEARINGS BEGUN
1GALLINGER BILL
Prohibits Condemnation for
Streets Until Money Has
Been Provided.
LOUIS P. SHOEMAKER
TELLS OF INJUSTICE DONE
Col. G. A. Armes Explains How He
Dedicated $100,000 Worth of
Land Without Benefit.
i ne c?ai linger diii, proviumg inai m
the future the District Commissioners
shall not inaugurate condemnation proceedings
and assess the cost of the land
taken for any street until sufficient
money has been appropriated to improve
the street was today the subject
of a hearing before the subcommittee
on streets and avenues of the Senate
District committee.
Routs P. Shoemaker. Col. Ceorge
Truesdell. former District Commissioner;
Col. Ceorge A. Amies, John H. Saul
and H. E. Rust appeared in support of
the bill. District Commissioner Brownlow
and the Engineer Commissioner,
Maj. Kutz, opposed the measure.
Tells of Injustice Done.
Mr. Shoemaker told the committee that
much injustice was done under the present
law, which permits the Commissioners
to institute condemnation proceedings, assess
the benefits against abutting property
owners, although the streets in rnanv cases
are riot opened fcPr years. He said that
while the Brightwood Citizens" Association.
for which he was sneaking, had
every confidence in the present Commissioners
they would not always be in office
a/Ki other men might use their power
unjustW under the existing law.
Col. yArmes was the next witness. He
said t.jat injustice had been done him.
Under promise of former District Commissioners,
he said, that streets would
be opened through a section in which he
owned considerable property, he had dedicated
property for streets worth $100,000.
The streets, he said, had never been
opened. ^
Says Assessments Increased.
Col. Armes said that in the meantime
the assessments on his property had
been greatly increased.
Col. George,v-f'ruesdell said he was
heartily in favor of the bill. He told
the committee that he had suffered
great\y from evils which the bill seeks
to remedy. He said he was particularly
opposed to the compulsory assessment j
>f the entire cost of damages as beneIts
under the existing law, regardless |
>f what the jury might think the benefits
really were. The benefits assessed i
ihould be confined to what the jury j
should find in each case, he said.
Defense of Present Law.
In defending the existing law Commissioner
Brownlow stated that since
1899, when the highway law for the
District went into effect, to January 1,
1916, there had been dedicated 123
miles of streets in the District: that
about 1 j miles of streets had been condemned.
of which 14.96 miles had been
condemned under special acts of Congress
and two-tenths of a mile under
condemnations originated by the Commissioners.
He said there were now
pending several condemnations begun
by order of the Commissioners.
Mr. Brownlow said if it were possible
for the damages to be held up along
with the benefits until the streets
should actually be improved, the proposed
change In the law might work.
But he told the committee that the
damages, which are the cost of the
land taken for streets, must he paid
immediately. He also suggested that
the enactment of the proposed lawwould
tend to prevent future dedication
of land for streets and halt the
proper development of the citv.
t
Views of Mai. Kutz.
Maj. Kutss said that the Commissioners
do not claim that the present system
is perfect, but that it is better
than the system proposed ii the Gallinger
bill. He said that the bill would
take away the power of the Commissioners
to order condemnations of
land for streets before appropriations
of money for the improvements of
streets are made. He said that some
condemnation proceedings run over a
period of two years, whereas the appropriations
die with the fiscal year for
which they are made, and that the
Commissioners might have to go hack
to Congress again and again for appropriations
for the same streets.
Would End Weeded Power.
He also pointed out that the proposed
law would take away from the Commissioners
the power to order condemnations
for short streets to connect
others, which is sometimes very greatly
needed.
Commissioner Browrilow suggested to
the committee, that the opening of
"paper streets" was, as a matter of
fact, a benefit to the property holders,
since they increased values in many
cases.
Senator Saulsbury, thp chairman of
the committee, asked whether assessments
for benefits were made with the
understanding that the streets would
be improved for travel immediately.
Assistant Corporation Counsel Smith
replied that such was the case. He
pointed out. however, that the assessments
could be paid over a period of
Ave years and could not be collected, if
not paid, until the end of the five years.
Representative Tinkham of Massachusetts.
a member of the House District
committee, who has a bill similar to
the Gallinger measure before the House
District committee, was present and
spoke in favor of the bill.

Precedent in Belgian Invasion.
I
Discussion of foreign affairs on th<
floor of the Senate by administratior
senators was awaited with unusual in
terest today, following last night's
White House conference between Pres
ident Wilson. Chairmen Stone and Klooc
of the Senate and House foreign af
fairs committees and Majority Leadei
Kern of the Senate.
The conference was held at the instance
of Senator Stone, who is to address
the Senate later in the week or
the admittedly grave situation resulting
from the announced intention ol
the central powers to sink, after February
29. all armed merchant ships ol
the enemy.
The conference was said authoritatively
today to have been held in order that
the President might inform the con
gressional leaders on the status or me
negotiations with Germany over submarine
warfareSenator
Stone, it was said, asked tc
see the President to learn what the
facts in the negotiations really were.
The President tnoueht Senator Kern
and Representative Floor! should have
the same information and asked them
to be present.
The President told the three leadera
that although the foreign situation
was grave, it was not critical at th
present time. It is understood that he
said the l;nited States would remain
firm in its position that merchantmen
have a right to arm for defensive purposes.
Secretary Lansing discussed the situation
further with the President this
morning, but said he had received no
information today regarding the German
situation.
The President does not believe there
should be much discussion of the forego
situation in Congress, because ot
the danger of embarrassing the negotiations
being carried on by the State
Department.
Senator Stone, however, will make a
speech later this week, replying to former
Senator Root's attack on the administration
before tlie republican state
convention in New York.
Gets Data From Mr. Lansing.
Following the conference Senator
Stone talked with Secretary learning,
who, i4 was said, furnished the senator
with informatics to in his
speech.
While defending the course of the administration
in regard to the foreign relations
of the United States, it is expected
Senator Stone will reply to the
recent speech of former Senator Root of
New York, attacking the policy of the
administration, and will attempt to- draw
a "deadly parallel" between the action
of President Roosevelt and his Secretary
of State, Mr. Root, toward Korea (now
Chosen) in 1904. and the course of the
administration in regard to the invasion
of Belgium in i914.
The Senate yesterday adopted a resolution
offered by Serfator Stone calling
for the correspondence between the
I'nited States government and Korea
when Japan occupied Korea during the
Russo-Japanese war.
Administration officials said they proposed
to show by the correspondence that
the I'nited States was bound by treaty
to aid Korea, whereas the treaty with
Belgium provides only that the United
States should respect the neutrality of
Belgium.
The treaty of 1882 between the United
States and Korea contains the following
art icle
"If other powers deal unjustly or oppressively
with either government*-th
other will exert their good offices, on
being informed of the case, to bring
about an amicable arrangement, thus
showing their friendly feeling."
, They declare that both Col. Roosevelt,
as President, and Air. Root, as Secretary
of State, ignored an appeal from
Korea.
The foreign relations committee dis
covered yesterday tnar some or me correspondence
bearing on the matter was
in its f}les.
A letter from Secretary Hoot to
Yueng-Tchen, special envoy of Korea,
without credentials, dated December
19. 905. said:
"Since your visit we have received the
following communication from Mr. Kim,
the regularly accredited charge d'affaires
of Korea in Washington:
'I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your note of the 24tli
ultimo, informing me that by agreement.
signed November 17. by the plenipotentiaries
of Japan and Korea, by
which Japan becomes the medium for
conducting the foreign relations of Korea,
you had. under date of the 24th ultimo,
telegraphed the American minister to
withdraw from Korea.
' *1 have further to inform you that
I have this day received instructions
from Mr. VI Wan Yong. the acting
minister of foreign affairs of Korea
to transfer to the Japanese legation
the archives and other property in my
charge.'
Mr. Boot Refused to Intervene.
"In view of this official communication.
it is difficult to see how the government
of the United States can pro
cecd in any manner upon the entirely
different view of the facta which you
tell us personally you had been led to
take by the information which you
have received. It is to be observed,
moreover, that the official communications
from the Japanese Kovernment
agree with the official communications
from the Korean government and are
quite inconsistent with your information.
"If, however, the difficulty of complying
with your wisites were surmounted.
we should be met by the fact
that on February 23, 1904, and on August
22. 1904, the Korean government
concluded with the Japanese government
treaties which are not now in any
respect impeached or questioned, by
which Korea gave to Japan extensive
control over her affairs and put hersell
so completely under the protection ol
the government of Japan as to rendei
completely impossible the application
of the provisions of the treaty with the
United States above quoted.
"The above-mentioned treaties between
Japan and Korea appear to be
of such a character as practically tc
give Japan control over the foreign relations
of Korea and to make the latest
treaty of November 17, 1905, which Is
now called into question, but a slight
advance upon the relations of eontro:
previously existing. Those previoui
relations of control amount to a complete
bar to any interference by th?
United States under the treaty of 1882
Under all these circumstances I fee!
bound to advise you that the government
of the United States does not
consider that any good purpose wouM
be subserved by taking notice Of jrotli
statements,** _

STILL CONSIDERING ~
PETROGRAD POST
Former Gov. Francis Has j
Short Conference With
President Wilson.
Former Gov. David R. Francis of
Missouri is still "considering" the offer
of President Wilson that he become
ambassador of the United States at
Petrograd. That is what Mr. Francis
said today after he had talked twenty
minutes with President Wilson. Mr.
Francis came all the way to Washington
to discuss the offer, and the fact
that he is still "considering" caused
the conclusion today Jhat he will
doubtless accept the position.
Mr. Francis' business interests are
large, and months ago he declined the
ambassadorship of the United States to
Argentina on the ground that the post
was too far away froip this country.
The same argument holds with him today,
but the President is said to have
urged Mr. Francis to take up the responsibilities
of the Petrograd position
if it is possible for him to do so. and
he greatly desires to serve the Presi1
dent.
Not Offered War Portfolio.
Relative to reports that he has been
offered the vacant portfolio of war,
Mr. Francis said today he never heard
of this until he got to Washington last
night and was told of rumors to that
; effect.
President Wilson did not go to the
1 executive offices today, but early in the
' morning received Secretary l,ausing in
the study of the White House, talking
with Mr. Lansing about, forty minutes.
Mr. Francis called later. After Mr.
Francis' departure the President went
to the patriotic exercises at Memorial
Continental Hall, and upon his return
from there had a long conference with
Secretary McAdoo, who expects to go
to South America soon, and wanted to
present his views on a number of important
pending matters, including appointments.
This afternoon the President will
take a long automobile ride with Mrs.
Wilson.

Allied Governments Called Upon to
Create Permanent Instrument
for World Peace.
PARIS. February 22.?Viscount Bryce,
who heads the British delegation oT
twenty-five members - of both houses
of parliament to the Anglo-French parliament
committee which is to hold
meetings here today and Wednesday
and Thursday, has given an interview
to the Paris Journal.
"The situation in the United States
is much too complicated and changes
too quickly from day to day," he said,
"for me to be able to form any conjectures
as to the manner in which
events concerning the . Washington
government are liable to develop.
Claims American Sympathies.
"There is, however, one thing which
should be known, and it is that the
sympathies of the great majority of
the American people go out clearly
and indisputably to the allies. I never
had the slightest fear of real difficulties
arising between the United States
and the allies, because it is hardly
necessary for me to say that there are
historical reasons why a genuine
friendship should be felt in the United
States for France and Great Britain."
L?ord Bryce expressed his satisfaction
at the fall of Erserum.
"The cause of the Armenians is especially
dear to me," he said. "There
, is no people in the world which has
suffered more.
Victims of Turkish Hatred.
"It has been a victim not of religious
I fanaticism, but of cold-blooded, premeditated
hatred on the part of the
brigands who term themselves the
Turkish government and who do not
intend to permit the existence of anynational
vitality except in their own
elements."
Although he had only just grot in
touch "With the members of the French
senate and chamber who are to take
part in the conferences, L*ord Bryce already
felt that the meetings and that
the exchanges of views would be of
the greatest benefit, both during and
after the war. "The great problem
w hich the allied governments will have
to face at the end of hostilities," he
said, "will be the creation of some instrument
able for all time to prevent
a conflagration such as now plunges
Europe in desolation."
President Poincare Tells
British Visitors of Hope
of Enduring Friendship
PARIS, February 22.?President Poincare.
in his address yesterday to the
British parliamentary delegation headed
by Viscount Bryce, said that the
relations established between the
Krencn and writish parliamentarians
would further strengthen the ties between
the two nations. He expressed
the wish that from the present brotherhood
of arms there should result a
permanent fraternity.
After paying a tribute to the splendid
military effort of Great Britain the
president continued:
Task to Be Completed.
"The task undertaken by the allies
is not of the kind to be left uncompleted.
It will be carried out until we
attain victory which we will celebrate .
together in indestructible friendship." t
Viscount Bryce, replying, said: "To
the feeling of admiration for France i
is to be added that of gratitude and i
friendship?gratitude for the heroic
efforts of a chivalric and indomitable
nation against a common enemy, and
friendship, based not only on material
interests, on the will to repulse the
enemy, but also upon what is higher?
on devotion to the sublime ideals uniting
us.
Ideals Animating' Allies.
"These are liberty, the defense of ]
public and individual law, the duty to (
suppress the methods of warfare of the
German government ? crueW methods 1
which shock the respect of humanity.
"The pact signed bv the allies is only
the protocol expression of a solemn !
promise rooted in the hearts of our .
people?a promise to continue this war 1
until victory, which will crown the <
sword of justice in assuring the future
peace of Europe."

In Pursuit o{ Turks.
Both on the center in the Erzerum
district and on the widely extended
northern and southern flanks the Russians
are everywhere, continuing with
energy pursuit of the routed Turkish
armies. The Russian advance Ps having
the effect not only of severing all
connections between the now isolated
Turkish army groups, but of constantly
strengthening communications of
their own forces, from the Black sea
district to the recently occupied town
of Mush, on the southern Russian wing.
Thus the operations of the Russians
are assuming the character of a solid
and unbroken advance along the entire
front. On the Black sea coast the
Russians have now driven the Turks
twenty miles west of Vitzseu, and the
occupation of Trebizond is believed to
be imminent.

units dislodged the Turks from the
