Advancing in Solid Lin* Along En

in Erxerum- Now Estimated at 40,000
in Killed Wounded and Priaoners.
•s Petrograd, via London, Feb. 22.—•
Both on the center in the Erzerum dls
trict and on the widely-extended
southern flanks the Russians are
everywhere continuing pursuit of the
routed Turkish army.
The iRassian advance is having the
effect of not only severing all connec
tions between the now Isolated Turkish
army groups, but of strengthening
their own forces from the Blaok sea
district to the recently occupied town
of Mush, on the southern Russian
wing.
Thus the operations of the Russians
are assuming the character of a solid
and unbroken advance along the en
tire front. On the Black sea coast the
Russians have now driven the Turks
twenty miles west of Vitzseu and the
occupation of Troblzond is believed to
be Imminent.
Meet Slight Assistance.
The Turks, evidently Impressed with
the headway the Russian forces are
making, appear to be inspired with the
sole aim of extracting themselves from
their position before they are sur
rounded and are making no effort to
hold endangered points now in their
possessi^b.
With a mfwtwinyn of resistance, con
sisting principally of real guard ac
tions, the Turkish retreat is one of the
most precipitate «f the war.
With Mush and Achlat in their pos
session, the Russian forces on the
southern trine are now proceeding
toward Bitlis. Once their objective is
obtained, lake Van, which has been
the scene of important fighting since

The successful Russian operations
near Knushkala, officially recorded,
are of importance in respect to
strengthening communications be
tween the center and the right flank.
According to latest advices from the
Caucasian front the Turkish losses at
Erzerum are estimated at 40,000 killed,
Wounded and prisoners.
DOUBTS BERLIN STORY.
Montenegrin Premier Discredits Storiea
'js^ of Peace Negotiationa.
Paris, Feb. 22.—A reported state
ment by the Austrian ambassador at
Madrid that the Montenegrin who had
remained in the country proposed that
King Nicholas should authorize them
to make peace with Austria has caused
Lazare Miouchekovitch, premier and
minister of foreign affairs of Monte
negro, to Issue a statement. It-'says:
"If the king and chief of his gov
ernment were obliged to leave Monte
negro to escape from the enemy after
giving strict orders that no negotia
tions be undertaken with the enemy
under any pretext, it is certainly not
likely that they would today accept
suggestions from persons now under
coercion from the invaders.
"The kins and the legal government
are in the same position as the kings
and governments of Belgium and
Serbia. Montenegro has been placed
under the protection of the great allies
who have given, assurance that no
separate terms will be made with the
enemy."
[An Overseas News Agency dispatch
from Berlin, dated Feb. 17, said that
according to information from the
Spanish office, said that the Spanish
ambassador to Vienna, at the request
of the Austrian government, had asked
if King Alfonso would consent to servQ
as mediary between the iMontenegrians
in Montenegro and their king In
Stance, and forward to the latter the
request of the former that they be
authorized to conclude peace.]

CONFER AT WHITE HOUSE.
President and Committee Chairmen
Discuss Foreign Situation.
Washington, Feb. 22.—Discussion 'of
foreign affairs on the floor of the
senate by administration senators is
awaited with unusual interest today
following last night's conference be
tween President Wilson, Chairmen
Stone and Flood, of the senate and
house foreign affairs committees, and
Majority Leader Kern, of the senate.
The conference was held at the in
stance of Senator Stone,, who is to ad
dress the senate on the admittedly
grave situation resulting from the an
nouncement of the central powers tha*
they will sink all armed merchant
ships of the enemy.
The leaders admit that the United

Lusitania case apparently, -was vir

Legislation Taking Shape.
The army's part in national defense
legislation began to take definite form
in congressional committees -today.
With the house military committee
in practical agreement on the outline
of the army bill—with federalization
of the national guard as a compromise
for the continental army plan—Chair
man Hay was at V/ork completing the
rough draft for detailed consideration
by the committee tomorrow!
Meanwhile the senate military com
mittee was framing its measure for a
thorough reorganization of the regtilar
army with a peace strength of oyer
160,000 men. It is understood the
house committee will accept the larger
army plan, provided its scheme for
federalizing the national guard is ac
cepted.
