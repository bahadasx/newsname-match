Liquor Legislation.
The session was enaracterized by
|W drastic laws dealing with the liquor
' " traffic. The prohibition act which
was submitted to the people in. the
general election last fall was re-en
acted, to prevent any cloud resting
upon the legality of the statute in any
^ possible future contest. The amount
which any person in the State may order
during any calendar month was
cut down from a gallon to two quarts,
but one may order 60 pints of beer in i
lieu of the two quarts. ;The measure
first contained a provision that any
amount of liquor carried in a suit- j
case or traveling bag would require'

r belled io the effect that it contained j
liquor. This section was finally cut
out. as was also the portion of the bill
^ which would have prohibited a man
from giving a drink to nis friend.
I The Liles measure which makes the j

the alternative of a fine, was ratified, j

with which the act was signed. Early
in the session an act was passed making
drunkenness on the highway a

constitute a misdemeanoi, the drunk5'
ences sad to be accompanied by some
jf|' disorderly conduct but no disorderly!
F conduct is necessary now. An act was
also passed to inclide "go-betweens"
I in liquor purchases.

be n!ade. This is also true as to any !
amount which may he borrowed for j
(he State hospital and the militia.
It is not yet a crime jo take a drink, j
but under a strict construction of the i
act. it is pretty nearly a crime to keep '
the two quarts one may order after j
he gets it.
Lei't-ovfr I>ispfiis?iry Stocks.
For a while it looked as if the counties
waich hart left-over dispensary i
stocks were going to be allowed to
keep thrm without any measure being
provided for their disposal, but j
finally local bills began to be intro- j
duced providing for the disposal o\ j
these stocks, and every county gov '
through its measure allowing the i**ft- j
over stocks to be sold a; wholesale
in wet territory outside the StaJe.
Mr. J. K. Breedin who was largely
interested in the prohibition election
x - ~ f'n a r?f hr.r
last fall, issued a srau'iiit-m mu vn?v. .
(?3y in which he pointed out thai tampering
with the law as it was ratified
by the people last September was
dangerous in that it would tend to
breed discontent and put the question I
of prohibition back into a political;
campaign?or words to that effect. The !
legislature, however, did not seem disposed
to see it that way. and every
measure making the liquor laws more
stringent found ready support both in
ihe house and in the senate.
About the only one that did not gei '
ill rough was the Carlisle bill, which i
passed the senate, but failed in the j
house, prohibiting the newspapers
from publishing whiskey advertisements.
ifonstitutfonal Amendments FuilW.
The three constitutional amend-,
ments of State wide importance which j
were offered during the session all |
failed. They were as follows:
To submit to the people a constitutional
amendment providing for woman
suffrage.
To submit to the people a constitu-1
tional amendment allowing divorce in j
citain cases.
To submit to the people a constitutional
amendment for biennial sessions
of the general assembly.
None of the proposed amendments
could secure the necessary two-thirds
in either house.
Administration Measures.
Among the "administration" ni*as

providing for the Torrens system of
land registration, which is optional at
this time; the measure for a board of

after the first ot' next year, and
the strengthening of the tax com- i

of review. This board of review was j
in the act as it was passed last year, j
but in some manner was lost out of the j
bill before it went to the governor for j
signature.
The McCuilr;i2h child labor bill as
if was finally ratified is a marvel in
brevity. It concains exactly 23 words.
It simply provides that after the first
day of January. 1917, no child under .
the age of 14 years shall be employed j
in any mill, mine or textile establish- i
ment in South Carolina.
iThe workmen's compensation act,
which was one of the "administration"
measures, failed of passage. The employers'
liability act, however, was
passed. This act follows the federal
statute and makes that sfatute effective
in South Carolina. It eliminates
the doctrine of contributory negligence
of employees and also eliminates
punitive damages. The representatives
in the legislature of the 1 a4
Coring people were favorable to this
measure, but opposed the workmen's
compensation acr.
Weekly Pay in 31111s.
Oil the last day of the session the
oil! was passed and ratified requiring
weekly pay days in mills. -'The representatives
in the legislature of the
ianoring element were iiiients?-'iy mtrested
in this hill, and are very
proud of its passage.
Driving Out flu* Southeastern.
One oi the hardest lights of the entire
session was on the measure prohibiting
insurance combinations for
the purpose of fixing fire insurance
rates. This bill was aimed directly at
rlip Southeastern Tariff association,
and tho State warehouse system figared
largely in its discussion. Trie
bill was not introduced at the instance
of the warehouse commission r,
but during the fighi for ami
against the bill the commissioner was |
?
day afler day summoned before committees.
There is no doubt that
the reduction in fire insurance
secured by the commissioner
outside of the Soctheastern and the
refusal of the Southeastern to work
with tho commissioner in thp protec;ion
of S*::te cotton had a great deal
to do with the passage of the bill.
There was a clear majority in the
Iioiisp of some 22 members lor the
jihnlirinn of tho Southeastern. On |
Thursday night the members who
were trying to save the Southeaster:
I
instituted a filibuster which kept the
house in session until after 3 o'clock
Friday morning. but the majority
against them was determined, and the
bill was shoved through by main
force. During (his filibuster Speaker
vHoyt was firm in his rulings, and re-|
ec*?d a great deal of credit upon
himself by the manner in which he
handled a most difficult situation.. The
bill was nilored through the senate by
Senator Laney of Chesterfield, and
through the house by Mr. Odom of
Chesterfield, and the agricultural committee.
Ttie bill was ratified and sent to the
governor 011 Saturday night. It pro- j
i
hibits combinations of insurance companies
for the purpose of fixing rates;
provides for a review of rates- by the
insurance commissioner, subject to
summary court review; exempts the
Mill Mutuals and Factory Insurance
association, and provides that nothing
contained in the act shall be held to i
interfere with any insurance placed |
by or througn tne state wareuuuae
commissioner. ,
State Warehouse Commissioner.
The strength of the State warehouse
commissioner was clearly evidenced
during the session. On the part of
some there was opposition to him and
to the system, but practically every
request which he made of the legislature
was granted. In fact, it may be
stated with truth that prohibition and
warehouse system were tne aoiuiuaui
issues in the South Carolina legislature
of 1916. They had no connection
and there was no attempt to con-1
nect them and their being mention^*!
together is not intended to convey
this meaning. What is meant to be
conveyed is the fact, as shown by t'ne
rocords. that 011 every issue joined affccting
prohibition or the warehouse
system, either commanded an overwhelming
majority of both house and
There \va? only one measure which
was advocated by the warehouse commissioner
for the benefit of the farm- j
ers which failed of passage. This was
the Beattie-Laney graders' bill. Thi6
bill would have enforced the federal
standards in South Carolina, and
have increased the annual value of
the cotton crop to the farmers by at
least a million dollars each year. The
bill was killed in the senate before
it reached the "house.
It may be interesting to note now
I the members from Newberry noted on
l the bill to drive the Southeastern
| trust out of the State. On the passage
of the bill in the senate there
i was no opposition. In the house Mr.
i Workman voted for the fill (to drive
the Southeastern out) and Messrs.
l
f
Mower and Chapman voted against
the bill (to allow the Southeastern to;
remain in the State). Over i nthe sen-'
ate when the bill went back for concurrence
in the house amendments, a
test vote was had. and seven of the
senators voted for non-concurrence.

solicitor of the new circuit. So that
t the judge and the solicitor of the new

Thr legislature added another county
to the 44 counties of the State, provided
the case now pending in the supreme
court is not adverse to the new
county on the legal aspect of the matter.
Governor Manning on Saturday
signed the new county measure. There
was very little opposition in the legislature
to the formation of MoCcrmick
county. -There were a number of
gentlemen before the committee of the
senate in advocacy of the new county.
Abuse of Free Scholarships.
A stringent resolution directing the
State board of charities to investigate
the financial standing of those
eniovins: free scholarships in the
State's educational institutions, was
adopted as the outcome of t'ne fight
in }he general assembly against the
abuse of free scholarships. The board
of charities is to look into the financial
condition of fhr scholarship holders.

:o the sentimental, culminating in the
patriotic. A tnrill went throughout
ihe house when the group around the
piano broke imo the national anthem,
and the feeling found its climax in the
outburst of handclapping and cheering
when "Dixie"' was heard.
Representatives Beckett, of Beau|
fort, with his violin accompanied the
piano, greatly to the enjoyment and j
pleasure of the throng.
There were several mock sessions
of the senate and house during the
I aours of waiting. Senator Hughes of

led the fun-making in the senate, and
the clever maner in which they got
