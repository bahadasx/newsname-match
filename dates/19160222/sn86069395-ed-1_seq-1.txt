GROWING
SENTIMENT
For The .Bond Jssue Insures
-""Its' Success Next
Month.
ALL ROADS TO BE BENEFITED
Good Roads Association Sue
cinctly Elucidates The Plan
Proposed.
The proposed bond issue to be
voted upon Saturday, March 18, is a
plan for improving and developing
all the roads of Christian county.
While it means that Christian county's
part of the "Dixie Bee Line High
way" will become a reality and not a
dream, it also means that every sec
tion cf the county is b? bnfitpd as
well.
Briefly the plan proposed is this:
Under the present . Constitution of
Kentucky, the State of Kentucky can
lend its credit to any of the counties
in the State for the purpose of en
abling those counties to issue or float
bonds to build roads. The limit of a
county's bonded indebtedness is 5
per cent, of its total assessed value of
taxable property. Christian county
at present has an assessment for tax
ation, of all property, both real and
personal and railroad franchises of a
little more than $15,000,000. The
present bonded debt of the county is
$262000.
' Christian county at present, under
the law, can issue practically $500,000
worth of bonds. However, an issue
of $400,000 is contemplated.
UiideAli6.Stato aidjjaw, passed by
the Legislature in 1914, the State of
Kentucky proposes to help each coun
ty in proportion to what each county
does for itself in tbe matter of build
ing roads. The law provides that if a
county should issue bonds for the
purpose of building roads under the
inspection and supervision of the State
Road Department, that the State of
Kentucky will apply each year a pro
rutu part of the State road fund upon
the interest and sinking fund neces
sary to retire these bonds.
Under this arrangement Christian
county is in a position to receive each
year if it issues bonds, approximately
$15,0OD from the State Road Fund
until the bond issue is retired.
The bond issue of $-100,000 moans
an interest charge of 5 per cent, or
$20,000 and an additional mm of $10,-
000 annually for the purpose of creat
ing a sinking funu. With the State
help Christian county will be able to
finance the whole issue of $400,000 flt
an expense of only $15,000 per year,
which is less than tho interest upon
the entire amount. This $15,000 is to
be raised by a slight increase of 10
cents on each $100 worth of property
in Christum county, making the tax
rate 60 cents instead of 50 cents as it
now stands.
If Christian county docs not avail
herself of this opportunity to issue
bonds it will absolutely lose the State
help of $15,000 a year which it might
nut into good highways, since the Road
and Bridge, Fund of $35,000 is not suf
ficient to meet the needs of tlie dirt
roads, and of the old turnpikes, which
must bo maintained and repaired. In
addition to this loss of $15,000 the
county-will also lose whatever it pays
into tho State 'Road Fund, which
means at least $0,500 per year, not to
sneak of the numerous automobile
license taxes paid by citizens of this
county.
The nlan to vote these bonds Is non
partisan and nonpolitical and is fos
tered by tho Good Roads Association
of the county.
STORE BROKEHPEN.
S. Bohn's store, Sixth street, was
entered by burglars Friday night and
about $35 in cash was taken. Entrance
to tho building was effected by priz
ing tho rear door. It was evident
that tho thieves wanted only money,
as nothing else was missed from tho
store.

London, Feb. 21. The Russian?
army which captured Erzcrunr, in

the retreat of the Turks, who arc re
tiring with as much speed as possible.
Dispatches from Petrograd report the-
capture of the towns of Mush and.
Achlat, to the south, heavy fighting
preceding their taking by storm.
The next objective of the southern
wing of the Russian army is Diar

batteries and harassing the retreating
troops, The northern wing ot the
Russian army has captured the town
of Widje and is driving the Turks
back in the direction of Gutnish
