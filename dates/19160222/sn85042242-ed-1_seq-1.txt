John iH. Worst, president of the
State Agricultural college, of Fargo,
was elected president emeritus of that
Institution yesterday by the state
board of regents, before which he re
cently submitted a plan for reorgan­
ization of the institution. Frank
White, Valley City, and L. F. Craw­
ford, Sentinel Butte, members^of the
board, went to Fargo Sunday and laid
the plan before Mr. Worst yesterday,
who accepted the honor and severs
active connection with the institution
as an executive next June. At that
time, he is eligible for a Carnegie
pension.
Two iPlans Submitted.
The regents submitted two plans
of retirement to Mr. Worst. One was
to accept the title of president emeri
tus, such as has been conferred in
many states to retiring university
presidents, and sever connections
with the school, or to retain the title
and become a field lecturer. If he
accepts the latter plan, 'Mr. Worst will
be continued at a salary of $2,(KM a
year. 'He may, however, elect to re­
tire from educational work and ac­
cept a •Carnegie pension. This change
becomes
effective at the eiid of the
present school year.
Siictfesidr Not Named.
No arittoiincement was made as to
Wor^t'sj possible successor. A story
lias been going the rounds that Tread
well Twichell is slated for the job,
This is denied vigorously by the
board. Whether Prof. Cooper, head
of the ext0n»totf-department, will be
selected is not known. He has been
given abaolute control over his de
patfment and it was this arrangement
that caused-considerable friction at
the farnb school. Worst objected
strenup'iisly to the plan, declaring
that the dual arrangement was a men­
ace tqijibe, jiiCfB£3s of the school.
The" £fjtftti|pent of Worst from ex­
ecutive'management ot the institution
paves the way ,|br., a reorganization
of the college ana an elimination of
the factionalism which has militated
against the development of the school.
IMembers of the board of regents and
the educational experts have given
particular attention to the needs of
this institution, realizing the vital re­
lationship it bears to the chief indus­
try of the state.
There has been more or less unrest
at the Agricultural school for some
time. Last summer it culminated in
the elevation of Wlorst to the posi­
tion of president emeritus and the
election of Prof. Ladd as head of the
college.
Worst Spoils Coup.
Worst was away when the old
board executed this coup. When he
returned, he refused to accept the
new honor without salary embellish­
ments and took his case directly to
Governor Hanna. He made the point
that this would render him ineligible
for a Carnegie pension, as he had one
more year to serve in order to round
out the 20-year peripd required. The
board then met and rescinded its ac­
tion, after two members had resigned
and matters were restored to status
quo at the school.
'Made Disclosures.
Last winter, when the Latkrop com­
mittee was at work investigating con­
ditions at the educational institutions,
iM!r. Worst made several sttartling
disclosures as to conditions at the
Agricultural college, indicating that
the faculty ran the college. He even
declared that they met and outvoted
him on vital matters. At that time
he asked for some legislation that
would make him the real head and
subordinate the various departments.
The board of regents has been in­
vestigating these conditions and
doubtless when the new president is
chosen, announcement will be node
as to the plan of administration.
Starts Political Rumor.
The retirement of Worst on the eve
of the 'Nonpartisan district conven­
tions revived the rumor that he may
be endorsed as the gubernatorial can­
didate of this organization. When
President Worst was in Bismarck last
week, he denied that he was a can­
didate for governor, but he did not
say that he would not accept an en­
dorsement or make the run provided
the backing was substantial so as to
insure a reasonable hope of victory.
Two years ago Worst was in the
senatorial fight, but went down to de­
feat in a three-cornered fight with
Gronna and former Attorney General
Miller.
The Nonpartisan league will hold
conventions today to select delegates
to a mass convention in Fargo. Con­
siderable interest will center upon
these meetings as reflecting Worst
sentiment.

FLOOD CONDITIONS
HUE IIICII Bftlf#
Natchez, Miss, Feb. 21.—Improved
conditions for the flood victims in
northern Louisiana were reported to­
night. The waters from the Xcwell
ton break in the 'Mississippi levee
were reported nearer Vandalia, and
gradually rising in the towns of Wa­
terproof and Rodney, but those in
touch with the situation said flhis
change for the worst was offset by in­
creased efficiency in relief work.
Negroes on the levees between
Newellton and Natchez and at points
below Newellton were reported to
have secured temporary relief in the
shape of food and shelter.
U. S. Weather Bureau Station in

North of Here.
ICE IN YELLOWSTONE
IS BROKEN ALRJSADY
The ice in the Yellowstone river
from a point between 'Billings and
Glendive broke up yesterday and to­
day the Yellowstone is open from
that point to its mouth, or where it
flows into the Missouri. This in turn
should cause the ice in the Missouri
about iMondak, Mont., and Buford, N.
D., to start breaking soon. The ice
at' Williston is still firm and ice har­
vesting was in proccss at that point
yesterday.
The weather bureau is in constant
toucli with all points above and will
issue prompt warnings as soon as con­
ditions will warrant. Mr. Roberts
states there are no indications of the
river breaking up at this point for
several dayB at least.
Mandan, 'Feb. 21.—Breaking all pre­
cedents the -western ^North Dakota
and eastern Montana rivers are today
breaking up, at least three weeks
ahead of any time in history.
The Yellowstone river in Montana
is pouring its flood waters into the
Missouri and it is expected that the
Missouri will be broken up here with­
in four or five days.
Early Sunday morning the Heart
river ice began to move. A rise of
six feet was registered up to 11
o'clock last night caused by the gorg­
ing of ice at a point a short distance
above the mouth where the Heart
empties into the Missouri. Water
backing up flooded the lowlands and
forced people to leave about half a
dozen houses.
The Missouri Slope state fair
grounds are under ten feet of water,
and the Russell Miller Milling com­
pany plant located on the Heart river
bank is closed down on account of
the high water. A big force worked
all day yesterday building dikes
around the property.
The Cannon Ball river which emp­
ties into the Misspuri 3ft miles south
of Mandan also broke up yesterday
and is running free, ilie Knife river
emptying into the Missouri at Stan­
ton is breaking and water is rising
rapidly. In Oliver county to the north
the Square Butte creek has broken
and is flooding the lowlands. The
only damage there is confined to hun­
dreds of tons of hay put up by the
ranchers which is_ being floated away.
Sweet Briar creek emptying *nto
the Heart fifteen miles west of Man­
dan. bad risen ten feet during the
early flood. Northern Pacific main
line tracks at that point are threaten­
ed. Water is also running over the
tracks of the north and south branch­
es of the N. P. out of this city, and
all trains are running on slow time
because of soft tracks.
While the lower portions of the
city are partly flooded from the back­
waters of the Heart river, no ser­
ious damage is anticipated unless the
Missouri breaks and gorges at Sibley
Island, ten miles south.
Weather predictions are for a con­
tinuation of the extreme warm weath­
er of the past week.

Washington, Feb. 21.—National pre­
paredness legislation took.a long step
forward in congress today, when the
house military committee reached a
practical agreement on the outlines
of the army bill it will unanimously
present for passage.
Chairman Hay was authored to
frame the measure, whicJi is a corn1
promise for the continental army plan,
advocated by former Secretary Garri­
son and President Wilson.
Complete federalization of the Na­
tional Guard will be substituted for
the proposed continental army, and
the White House was informed dur­
ing the day that the committee was
a unit in supporting the plan, only
the language and minor details re­
maining to be worked out.
Standing Army of 575,000.
The measure will grant, virtually,
the entire program mapped out by
Secretary Garrison for the regular
army and go even farther than he
recommended in providing for reserve
military supplies. A total peace
strength of 575.000 men in the stand­
ing army, and the guards combined,
will be provided for, with reserve
systems to more than double the
force in war.
The expense for the whole estab­
lishment this year is roughly estimat­
ed at $174,000,000, exclusive of x'ana
ma canal defenses, carried in another
bill. Proposals for j^Ufopal mili­

purpose, and whatever may later be

ITEf CREDIT
British Expenditures Have Been
Kept Down to $25,000,000
a Day.
London, Feb. 21.—The house of
commons tonight passed votes, of
credit to the amount of $2,1($00^000.
This is expected to carry'the war to"
the end of May, bringing the total
sum appropriated by means of vote
of credit, since the outbreak of the
war, to $10,410,000,000, a sum, accord­
ing to Premier Asquith, "not only be­
yond precedent, but actually beyond
the imagination of any financier of
this or any other country."
Parliament was occupied today en­
tirely with financial questions. Pre­
mier Asquith spoke for fifty minutes
in presenting the government's mo­
tion for the new war credit. The
chancellor of the exchequer, Reginald
McKenna, followed with a statement
regarding American exchanges, which
he declared is now as high as the
Britsh government wishes it to be.
The point emphasized by Premier
Asquith was not the total amount ne­
cessary for the war, but the fact that
by careful economy and safeguarding
the government had succeeded in
holding down the expenditure well be­
low $25,000,000' a day, which figures
he thought unlikely to be exceeded at
any time.
The chanceller of the exchequer, in
an optimistic statement regarding the
condition of British credit, said:
"Criticism has been made that we
are not taking proper steps to main
tain our credit, particularly with ref­
erence to American exchange. I
merely ask the house to compare our
American exchange with that of any
other of the belligerents. At present,
the rate is 4.6 and the government
does not wish it higher than that for
the simple reason that we are encour­
aging imports by keeping the ex­
change a little below par and check­
ing the exports of gold to America.
"It is an absolute marvel that after
18 months of war, we are still the
only gold country in the wor.d."
During the course of the evening,
Sir Joseph Walton, Liberal, for the
Barnsley division of Yorkshire, criti­
cised the government for not more
carefully inspecting munitions re­
ceived from the United States.
Care shoud be taken that we do
not get bad supplies from America,"
he said. "I am informed that of 28
shells recently fired by one of our
*nwit.*ers at the front, only four

and we recommend that William H.

Waukegan, 111., Feb. 22.—The re­
sults of a searching investigation
into the immediate past of William
orpet, as it is known to his friends
and acquaintances in Madison, Wis.,
have been placed in the hands of
State's Attorney Dady of Waukegan
by Harry Beardsley, the Hums detec­
tive, who has spent a week prying in­
to the young student's career in the
university town.
Beardsley, it is believed by the
prosecution, has forged the linal links
in a chain of evidence which will con
vice Orpet as the murderer of his
sweetheart, Marian Lambert, in the
woods near Lake Forest.
Among other things Beardsley said
he establisjie«V .th6b,^f^t tlmt three
months ago Orpet went to Carl Fisch­
er, a fellow student in the journalism
class at the University of Wisconsin
and begged Fischer to find him a phy­
sician who would consent to perform
an abortion.
The next day Fischer left word with
Charles Hassinger, the drug clerk
who afterward told of having sold Or­
pet a two-ounce bottle, that ho had
done as Orpet requested.
"Tell Orpet," he said, according to
the detective, "that 1 have a doctor
who will fix hint up."
When Hassinger was questioned in
the office of Chief of Police Shaugh
nessy at Madison Beardsley asked for
the name of this physician.
Doctor's Name Kept 'Secret.
"You needn't tell that," Chief
Shaughnessy interrupted, hastily, and
so the doctor's name was not learned.
"This physician was not the only
one," said Beardsley. "For some time,
I found, Orpet had been consulting
several doctors in Madison, making
inquiries about abortion operations
and means to relieve the condition of
a girl in whom be was interested.
"He made several of his fellow stu­
dents his confidants about his trou­
bles and talked with them repeatedly.
With them he used the Lambert girl's
name openly. Scores of the boys up
there told me he has been restless
and worried for weeks. Hfe couldn't
sleep nights, they said.
"As for his purchase of the bottle,
we have that established absolutely.
Another clerk in the drug store has
corroborated Hassinger's story. This
man remembered afterwards that
Hassinger had asked him how much
he should charge for an empty bottle,
and that he had suggested 5 cents as
a fair price.
"According to these clerks, Orpet
asked first for an empty six or seven
grain capsule. He seemed disap­
pointed when he found they hadn't
one that large, but took the bottle
instead."
On his return to Waukegan Beards­
ley, who has been employed by the
city of Lake Forest, was formally re­
tained by the state to help prepare
for the prosecution.

"I am going to devote myself now

The Ambitious Bee
The fight being put up by New
Rockford for the state capitol
buildings is not taken seriously
by most people over the state.
One of the arguments used is that
the capital would be more central
in New Rockford than in Bis­
marck. As soon might we re­
move all of the other fifteen
state institutions as the capital.
What a storm center New Rock­
ford would be if all the institu­
tions were collected there! The
ambitious bee causes some people
to perform wonderful stunts
when it gets down to business.—

AS HER SCHOOLMATES REMEMBER DEAD LAKE FOREST GIRL
Mandan Businessmen Are
Loyal to Bismarck in the
Fight to Retain Capital
"When the men interested in capi­
tal removal reach this section of the
state they will find Mandan, the Slope
country and the entire werttem sec­
tion of the state lighting shoulder to
shoulder with Bismarck against the
project," said a prominent Mandan
merchant yesterday, when approach­
ed by a representative of the Tribune
relative to his views on the subject.
That statement expresses the senti­
ment of the rank and file of Mandan,
as far as capital removal is concern­
ed. A number of prominent business­
men were interviewed on the subject
yesterday, and individually and col­
lectively they arc opposed to the
"movement." Not one was found who
was ready to say that he was in favor
of moving the capital to New Hock
ford. Otto Bauer,, secretary and treas­
urer of the Bingenheinier Mercantile
Co., said, -I'm in favor of capital re­
moval, if they will move it to Man­
dan I'd be willing to pay the addi­
tional tax necessary to bring that
about, but as far as moving it to Now
Rockford or any other place in the
state, I'm opposed to it first, last and
all the time."
L. A. Tavis, president of a chain ol
Morton county banks, felt the sam«
way. "I am opposed to removal at all
time,'' said Mr. Tavis, "and I think
the sentiment of all reasonable people
is for Bismarck. I ain certain that
the entire Slope country will stand
back of Bismarck in its tight to down
New Itockl'ord's ill-advised proposal."
.f. H. Newton, head of the Missouri
Valley Grocery Co., was approacheu
on the subject, and it didn't take Mr.
Newton a second to say, "I am abso­
lutely and emphatically in favor of
Bismarck, and can see no logical rea­
son for moving the capital. You will
jind Mandan residents to a man Dack
of you in your fight. This is a case
of your fight being our fight as well,
a sort of union against an intruder."
Joseph P. Iless, vice-president of
the First National bank, outlined a
number of good reasons why the cap­
ital should remain where it is. He
said in part: "The primary objection
to capital removal, throughout the
state, should be on account of the big
Increase it will make in taxes. It
will put an added tax on the state for

der some other law, and the tax pay­
ers pay the bill.
"The western part of the state

they take the capital away, why, the
eastern part of the state will forget
we are here. No, il can't see where
Mandan or the Slope country will
benefit, by having the capital moved,
and 1 am opposed to it, right from the
start."
L. S. Hoyer, cashier of the Mer­
chants National bank, was another
who was opposed to changing the
seat of government. "Why, it's ridi­
culous to think that Mandan or the
Slope country would do anything but
back Bismarck in this fight," said Mr.
Royer. "My sentiments are strongly
in favor of maintaining the capital
where it is, and I can see no good
reason for making a change. A
change will mean increased taxes and
everlasting enmity between the east­
ern and western sections of the state.
It will be the opening gun for removal
fights that will, if successful, put a
load on every tax-payer in the state."
A. H. Peterson, cashier of the State
Bank of Morton County, re-echoeu the
sentiments of his fellow townsmen
when he said, "It's almost as much
our fight as Bismarck's, and I think
our people fully realize what moving
the capital to New Rockford will
mean to them. Aside from a big in­
crease in taxes, it will mean a decid­
ed loss of prestige to this section of
the state. Every newspaper and
every tax-payer in the western sec­
tion of the state should fight the pro­
ject, and settle it once and for all
time."
Attorney J. F. Sullivan opposed the
change on the grounds of increased
taxation, and for the reason that, aa
he says, "I am for the Slope country
all the time and a change would cer­
tainly strike us all alike. We like to
know that we are near the capital for
business reasons, and feel that any
change is absolutely unnecessary and
unwarranted."

Sensational alle­
