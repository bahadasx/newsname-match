Signs of Spring More Infal
lible Than the Blue Bird
Seen.
An umbrella mender clad in a new
and bright pair of blue overalls was
seen this morning strolling down "Ad
ams street ringing his bell in de
fiance of Mayor Bowen's ordinance es
tablishing that section of the city as
a quiet zone. Everyone on the street
noticed the bright bluo garment of
th eold man and It was Indeed quite
conspicuous contrasted with the shab
by old dilapidated umbrellas he car
ried. This' may be taken as a final
Incontrovertible sign that spring Is
really upon us. This has even the
January blue bird worsted.'
If further-proof Is needed the group
of boys on tho Court House steps
who were actually playing marbles
for keeps and wearing boles in the
knees of their stockings and acquir
ing sore knuckles which they will
proudly exhibit when the teachers
back Is turned in the school room,
ought to be sufficient for even the
most hardened person who Is still Im
mune from the Fatal Spring Fever.
Today being a holiday the streets
were filled with a parade of pedes
trians which only lacked the brighter
colored clothos of the women to riv
al the Easter Sunday procession. An
old Italian who ^as escorting his
young daughter up the street noticed
the flags waving from the fronts of
some of the stores and. office build
ings, wondered what, the colebratlon
was about so be asked tho policeman
on the corner:
"What day this? Holiday?"
"Sure, this Is George'Washington's

"Oh. I see," said tho Calabrlan.

Walter S. Mumford Got It
Direct From Rock'

Not Much Time Was Con

mission.
At least two of the half "dozen or
more wirelesB stations In tbis city pick
ed up the mesBage which was sent
broadcast at midnight last nJsht to
test the efficiency of this mode of com
munication ji a national emergency.
Walter S. Mumford, the well known
electrical engineer, at his plant 1304
Sixth street, got the message direct
from the Rock Island arsenal, and
Bright Fawcett, a young amateur, got
ll at his home by relay from a station
In Wheeling.
The message waB sent out through
an arrangement of tue members of the
Amateur Operators' association. It ori
ginated at Arlington, the center of
tlio government wireless system, and
and was sent from there to the Rock
Island arsenal for transmission to all
the wireless stations throughout the
country. The idea was to Bee how
many stations would be able to pick it
up and to check up the time that
would be required to send it through
out the length and breadth of the
land.
The message, which is a quotation
from President Washington, was sent
from Arlington by Colonel Miclialson.
It reads:
A democracy requires that a
people who govern and educate
themselves should be so armed
and disciplined that they, can1 pro
tect themselves.

later, measured by central time, and
as it was known that it would have to
.be carried for some distance by a mes
senger before'it could,?be transmitted
by the Illinois plant, its receipt here
was ih very good time indeed..
At the Pawcett plant the receiving
timo was about 12.30 o'clock, which
demonstrates that not much time is
lost when messages are sent in short
