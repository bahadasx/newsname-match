To be prepared for war is one

There is a rank due to the

There can be no greater error
than to expect or calculate upon

TROUBLES UPON
THE DEMOCRATS
Kansas Suffrage Leaders De
scend Upon Bourbons.
Invite Party Leaders to Jump
Through Suff Hoop.
THEY CORNERED THOMPSON
Declared He Tfas a "Friend,"
but That Didn't Count!
"We Are Doing Today's Fight
ing Today" Miss Stevens.
Kansas suffrage leaders, backed by
the congressional union, today opened
a new four foot vein of trouble in
state politics when they stuck their
pick into the meeting of the Demo
crats. The new row which means lit
tle but grief, sorrow, anguish and tears
for the visiting Bourbons was unload
ed by Miss Mabel Vernon and Miss
Doris Stevens, pilgrims of the national
suffrage cause under the congressional
union banner.
With a fine display of humility,
abundant smiles and a ten of deter
mination, suffrage leaders re-enacted
their demonstration before President
Wilson and his party and told the
Kansas Democrats just how to per
form. Of course there was no poli
tics in it. Both suffrage workers pro
tested at the mention of such matters.
The Democrats were merely invited to
jump through a hoop. If they didn't
well, the congressional union wasn't
making open statements as to just
what might be done.
Battle lines for the meeting of the
congressional union in Topeka Wed
nesday were also formed while the
Democrats were being provided with
suggestions. As the congressional
union worked out its plan to make the
Democrats be good and force adoption
of the Supan B. Anthony resolutinon
before congress, anti-union workers
prepared to fight any display of mili
tancy in this state.
When Miss Stevens arrived in To
peka from New York, she carried a
few bombs for the national suffrage
association. She dropped them in a
meek and modest sort of way. She
merely suggested that the union
wasn't fighting the national associa
tion. The national organization might
come over and show its good faith by
helping the congressional union.
They Don't Want to Fight,
"We don't want to fight, but if the
other women are as strongly in favor
of the Anthony resolution as we are,
let them come over and help us." was
the kindly suggestion which Miss Stev
ens offered. It might mean that the
national suffrage association should
lay aside its own banner and unite
with the Stevens - Vernon - Monroe
crowd. AH of which may help to dis
turb the already ruffled feelings of the
suffrage association.
Just as soon as breakfast was out
of the way this morning Miss Stev
ens and Miss Vernon descended on the
lowly Democrats. For Just an hour
they forgot the factional row among
the Kansas women and scattered
briers and thistles all along the path
of the Bourbonites.
William H. Thompson, United States
senator, awoke to answer his telephone
and learn that the congressional union
had pitched its tent and was camping
on his trail. The Democratic senator
was asked for a conference.
"Why a conference with me?" asked
the puzzled senator. "Why. I have al
ways been a friend of suffrage."
But the explanation didn't go. Not
for so much as a minute or two. Miss
Vernon was on the other end of the
wire and she purred gentle two and
zhree syllable words of encouragement
into thenars of the senator.
Senator Thompson Falls.
'"Why, certainly. We are proud to
have you .as a friend. But don't you
think that as friends, we should meet
and talk thee matters over?'

Resolution Endorsing National
Suffrage Is Adopted.
SHELIiBARGERls SECRETARY
Fifty-Seren Delegates Elected
to the'State Convention.
Susan B. Anthony Resolution
Is Urged by Women.
At their convention this afternoon
the Republicans of Shawnee county
elected 57 delegates to the state con
vention which meets in Topeka March
21 and 57 delegates to the First dis
trict congressional convention which
meets at Atchison March 2 two dele
gations entirely friendly to the candi
dacy of D. W. Mulvane for national
committeeman.
There wasn't a slip nor a break dur
ing the convention. Every official act
was according to schedule. It was
the most harmonious convention held
by the Republicans of Shawnee county
in many years. Dr. L. A. Ryder, of
Topeka, was elected chairman by ac
clamation. There were two nomina
tions for secretary W. E. Connelley
and Fred Shellabarger but Connelley
withdrew and Shellabarger was elect
ed by acclamation.
Immediately after Dr. Ryder took
the chair D. W. Mulvane moved that
a committee of nine one from each
city ward and three from the coun
try districts be named by the chair
to draw up the list of delegates and
alternates to the state and congres
sional conventions.
Named Committee.
Pulling a poll book from hip pocket
Chairman Ryder named the following
men:
D. W. Mulvane, W. W. Page, H. M.
Phillips, Oren McAfferty, A. G. Bauer.
John Chaney, Richard Wilson, W. E.
Connelley and Oran Laytom.
This committee retired to an ante
room and began on the list of dele
gates and alternates.
Immediately upon their retirement
motion was made that the chair name
a resolutions committee composed of
three Republicans. Right off the bat
Chairman Ryder named P. H. Coney,
George Clark and J. S. Dean.
"That list reads like a list of Re
publican Republicans," some one in
the convention commented.
Mrs. Monroe's Resolution.
While the committees were out at
work Chairman Ryder invited dele
gates to talk about any subject they
wished. Mrs. Li la Day Monroe, while
not a delegate, had a resolution to of
fer and was given permission to do
so. Her resolution urged congress to
j pass the Susan B. Anthony suffrage
I amendment providing for nation-wide
' suffrage for women.
Mrs. Monroe made a short talk in
favor of the resolution and pointed
out that the Democrats, in session in
Topeka, were likely to pass a similar
resolution. She urged the Republicans
to get to it first.
"It would break my heart if you Re
publicans should allow the Democrats
to pass that resolution first."
Before anyone could make a motion
with reference to the resolution Chair
man Ryder called the meeting to order
"for business." But Judge J. G.
Slonecker secured the floor and mov
ed that the resolution be referred to
the resolutions committee without dis
cussion. That was the action taken.
Farmer Smith Favored.
There were shouts for "Farmer"
Smith and he responded. He announc
ed that he was strowgly in favor of
the resolution offered by Mrs. Monroe
but from that deviated to praises of
the Republican party.
