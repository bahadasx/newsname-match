In view of the practical certain
ty that Judge Dole will not be reap

introduced a bill. which, if it should
become a law, would be placed up

that when any United States judge

sion as judge of a federal court atj
least ten years continuously, and,
having attained the age of seventy

ry which is payable to him as a

FULL REGIMENTAL
STATUS AT ONCE
Major Broadbent received ad
vices from the Adjutant General's
department of the National Guard
on Friday that if all were rendv at
this end it would be possible to
change the Kauai wing of the mili
tary establishment from a battalion
to a regimental status at once.
This came as a surprise (a pleas
ing one, however), for previous
orders had fixed the time for the
shift-over as March 31 .
By the mail leaving this after
noon there will go to the Adjutant
General full information required
for making the change. The com
pany designations previously given
in this paper will be shown, to
gether with the names of their offi
cers and strength, respeqtively.
The next step in proceedings
will be an order creatine the regi
ment, following which Major
Broadbent will take command as
colonel, assign officers and start
the whole works at once. The
regimental and battalion field, staff
and line organizations are com
plete, so there need not be a mo
ment's delay.
WOULD HAVE DAILY
The Kauai Chamber of Com
merce, at its meeting Thursday
evening, adopted two important
resolutions in regard to the mails.
They were brought in by Eric A.
Knudsen, chairman ot the com
mittee on mails. The first of these
resolutions was as follows:
WHEREAS in the past it has
been the custom of the postoffice
clerks in Honolulu to consign all
the Kauai mails to the first port of
call-on steamers coming to Kauai,
outside of the regular mail days,
even though the same steamer
touches at several of the landings;
thereby causing the mails for the
other towns to lie for several days
at the first poit or putting the
business men of the other ports to
a great deal of annoyance and ex
pense to get their mails.
THEREFORE BE IT RE
SOLVED by the Kauai Chamber
of Commerce that the postmaster
at Honolulu be respectfully re
el lested to notify the mailing clerk
in Honolulu to find out beforehand
to what ports the steamer is sail
ing and then to bill the mail bags
of each port to their proper desti
nation. Committee on Mail Service,
Eric A. Kkudskx
Chairman.
Waimea, Kauai,

THE DAILY SERVICE
Following was the resolution on
the daih service running overland
WHEREAS. The business of
the island ot Kauai is continually
growing, and the amount of mail
coining to and going from Kauai
has more than doubled in the last
few years, and.
WHEREAS. The present mail
service on the i-.'and of Kauai is
entirely inadequate to meet the
ever increasing demands of busi
Hess;
THEREFORE BE IT RE
SOLVED by the Kauai Chamber
of Commerce that the Postmaster
Lieuerai ot tile united Maius ne
respectfully requested to prov-de a
dailv mail service on the island of
Kauai between Lihue. the couutv
seat, and Kekaha and Hanalei, the
