small groups which paraded Friedrlch

"I give you my word that In all those
Incidents which were called rloto or
street fights, from tho beginning of tho
war until this very day, not ono por
tion has been killed on German streets,
and not one soldier has been called to
assist the pollco or shoot at a mob."
Official Reports of fBattles."
Dr. Lowald, returning to his desk,
took two small flies of documents out
and. said 'Ho.' tola Interviewer with a
mile: r-
"ThM9 are the "brnofal repbrts, re
garding the terrific 'street battles about
which you wish mao, speak."
One' flle'bcre the Inscription, "Peaco
demonstrations In Berlin," tho other,
"Troubles of public order in Berlin
on account of the scarcity of butter."
Dr. Lowald continued:
"There were three so-called peace
demonstrations in Berlin, on Novem
ber 21, Novomber 30, and Dccembor a.
Of tho first 1 was an eyewltntfs.
When walklngg from tho Reichstag to
my office I noticed twenty or thirty
women" hero Dr Lownlu smiled tnd
repeated "no more than thirty, who
marched through tho historical Bran
denburg gate.
"Among them were some local lead
ers of the radical wing of tho Social
ist party, one of them a lawyer who
makes a specialty of defending So
cialists In the courts. Once In a while
the word 'peace' was shouted.
"A few persona tried to sing the
'International.' Finally the crowd was
dispersed by the police. Six persona
wero arrested, of whom- ono was a
mother who had a sick child at home.
Bhe was Immediately released.
1,000 In Seond Demonstration.
"About 1,000 persons took part In tho
econd demonstration. After thirty min
utes of it they were dispersed by the
Jollce. Two persons were slightly in
ured. "The third demonstration consisted of
what ought to bo called a promenade
of small groups on the Krledrlchstrasse.
Theso soon disappeared when Invited to
do so by the police. As I said before,
no one was killed nnd no soldier was
called to aid the police.
"As to the butter riots, they ceased
when the military authorities fixed max
imum prices, and they never wero real
riots. It was only Th Chemnitz, a town
of mora than 300.000 Inhabitants, that a
demonstration took place on a some
what larger scale.

CABINE
RUMOR
LANSING MAY BREAK
OFF PARLEYS WITH
I
Wilson Believed to Have Do-
oided on Course He Will
Follow in U-Boat Dispute.
NEW FORMAL NOTE PLANNED
President Is Understood to
Have Determined to Waste
No More Time.
Insistence by Germany on the right
to torpedo armed enemy merchant ships
without warning will probably bring
about an abrupt termination of tho
"confidential" negotiations between Sec
retary of State Lansing and tho Ger
man ambassador for a settlement of tho
Lusltanla controversy.
This is the situation, admittedly grave,
though not Immediately critical, which
President Wilson Is understood to havo
laid beforo Senator John W. Kern of
Indiana, majority leader ot tho Senate;
Chairman William J. Stono, of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee, and
Chairman Henry V. Flood, of the House
Foreign Relations Commltteo, at tho
secret conference at tho White Houso
last night.
The conference was arranged by
Senator tSone, w ohexplalned that be
cause of the conflicting reports which
have been printed concerning the at
tltudo of the Administration, he de
sired to know Just what the situation
was. When the President heard of the
Senator's request, ho decided to call In
Senator Krn and Congressman Flood.
The President today conferred for a
long time with secretary Lansing before
going to Cintlnental Memorial Hall to
attend the Washington's Birthday patri
otic exercises. There is every Indica
tion that the Administration has de
cided on tho course It Is to follow.
Germany and Austria moan to put
into cftect ono week from tomorrow
their new submarine campaign. It Is
their purpose to sink all armed enemy
merchant versels without warning.
Ships that are armed, they have de
clared, whether the armament Is for
offensive or defensive purposes, are t
all intents and rurporcs auxiliary shjlps
of war.
Established principles of International
law which allowed merchant ships to
arm for defense und mil retain their
peaceful character. Gsrmany and Aus
tria dvclanv aro dead 'letters In .view
or tW development of the submarine.
Against met. smallest un. In n, de
fensive armament, they contend. sub
marine Is defenseless.- Therefore, they
Insist, their submarine .SAhhot-b ex
pected to exercise- the (tittles or visit
and search and other measures of hu
manity. If they are to be exposed them
selves to attack.
That is Germany's position, sub
scribed to by Austria. It U not a posi
tion. President Wilson told tho con
ferees last night, that Is consistent with
tho assurances which Germany offered
to glvo for a 'settlement of tho Lusl
tanla controversy.
Rearing in mind always, ho said, that
th demand for assurances in the Lusl
tanla controversy was of utmost Im
portance if the United States was to
maintain successfully the rights of neu
trals on tte high seas; and bearing in
mind, also, that throughout the contro
versy no distinction was made between,1
armed and unarmed merchant ships, iTi
Is impossible for tho United mates to
accept a settlement of the Lusltanla
controversy which does not recognize
these neutral rights.
The Administration, the President told
the members of Congress, had been led
to believe by Germany's previous assur
ances that her submarines would hence
forth live up to the law.
May Reiterate Demand.
On October 7, Count von Bernstorff,
without drawing any distinction between
armed and unarmed liners, declared that
"liners will not bo sunk without warr
ing and without caro being taken tor
tho safety of the non-combatants on
board, provided these liners do not re
sist or attempt to escape."
Under her new declaration, as the
United States sees It Germany has sud
denly taken the position that liners
which are armed are not liners at all
but auxiliary cruisers.
With this situation confronting the
Government, the President Is under
stood to havo Indicated that It a satis
factory squaring of the new decree with
past assurances Is not mado by Ger
many on or before next week, tho Ad
ministration has decided to waste no
Coro tlmo In confidential parleys, but
111 send a formal note to the German
government through Ambassador Ger
urd, reiterating all previous demands for
a settlement of the Lusltanla nnd em
phasising the need for unequivocal as
surances for tho future.
