EDUCATORS JOIN IN A
DISCUSSION OF THRIFT.
Only 103 Save Money Out of Every
1,000 Population.
Detroit, Mich., Feb. 21. State super
intendents of public instruction, col
lege professors and business men
joined in a discussion of the subject
"Thrift" at a meeting tonight of the
National Council of Education. The
council is one of 21 bodies allied with
the National Educational association
which are to hold sessions in Detroit
this week.
'S. W. Straus, a Chicago banker, who
is president of the American Society
for Thrift, dealt with the problem- in
a general sense, while half a dozen
other speakers discussed various an
gles of the same subject.
"Individual Preparedness" was the
keynote of Mr. Straus" address.
"The most vital question in America
today la individual preparedness," he
said. "Not individual preparedness for
war, but individual preparedness for
anything that may come individual
preparedness to live useful, steadfast
lives for the benefit of humanity and
posterity."
Mr. Straus declared that although
the United States is a prosperous na
tion, "we are not a prosperous people"
and backed up his assertion with the
declaration that one person out of ev
ery ten who dies in any of the large
cities is buried in a potter's field.
"Statistics show that in the United
States there are only ' 108 who save
money out of every 1,000 population."
He added: "This compares with 554 in
Switzerland."
"The only way to lay the foundation
for the future thrift of the nation is
to begin today teaching thrift in our
schools," he said in conclusion.

Was Sent Out from r
port. Iowa,
Last Nii,;
Davenport, Iowa, Feb. 21. The pre
paredness and skill of the 25.000 li
censed amateur wireless operators of
tne united states was tested tonignt
when a message appropriate to the
celebration of Washington's birthday
was sent by William H. Klrwln at his
licensed station "9XE" for transmis
sion throughout the country. The mes
sage, which was despatched at 11 p. m.,
was intended to De picked up by all
stations within 300 miles of Daven
port and relayed in every direction for
transmission to the governors of each
state and the mayors of the principal
cities. The message was delivered to
Kirwin at his station by a messenger
from the Rock Island government ar
senal. It read:
"A democracy requires that a people
who govern and educate themselves
should be so armed and disciplined
that they can protect themselves.
(Signed)
"COLONEL NICHOLSON, U. S. A."
The country was divided into dis
tricts for the relaying of this message.
These districts form overlapping cir
cles with the relay stations at the
centers.
"We will attempt to weed out the
men who are not capable of getting
these messages," Mr. Kirwin said to
night, "and will be able in the future
to pick out the most desirable men."
Those operators not authorized to
receive the messages who in any way
delay its transmission will be reported
to federal officials for punishment.
Arrangements have been made to
have the message read by Boy Scouts
at Mount Vernon and on the battle
field of Bunker Hill.

NATIONAL INSTITUTION
FOR MORAL INSTRUCTION
To Open a Contest for a Child's Code
of Morals.
Washington, Feb. 12. The national
institution for moral instruction an
nounced tonight that it would open to
morrow a contest ror a child s code of
morals out of which it hopes to obtain
a standard code for general use in the
schools and homes of the country.
Seventy code writers, appointed by
state superintendents of education and
other prominent educators, will com
pete, each submitting a code, limited
to 3.000 words, and for the best a prize
of $5,000 will be paid. Thousands of
written and unwritten codes will be
sifted by the contestants, and the re
sults are expected to reflect the pre
cepts and principles of mothers, men
of affairs and educators throughout
the United States.
A board of three judges will select
the best of the 70 codes submitted and
efforts will be made to have it placed
in general use in the schools. The old
fashioned precepts of right and wrong
will, of course, be the basis of all the
documents, but the institution expects
the writers to go further than that
and to have their codes embody rules
of honor, courtesy, refinement and in
dustry. The $5,000 to be awarded has been
offered by a business man who desires
his identity withheld for the present.
DR. BLACK PREPARING
NEW REGULATIONS
For the Transportation of Dead Bodies
Through This State.
Hartford, Conn., Feb. 21. Dr. John
T. Black, secretary of the state board
of health, Is preparing new regulations
to be observed in the transportation of
dead bodies through this state. Under
the state law passed at the session of
1893 the board has the power to make
these regulations nad to require under
takers and others who are in any way
connected with the transmission of
such to serve them in their work.
One of the new regulations refers par
ticularly to certificates to be signed
by the undertaker. The old certifi
cates and the state law printed on the
back of it were slightly contradictory
in terms. The law requires that the
body after being disinfected shall be
placed in a hermetically sealed casket
or coffin. The new regulations will
reconcile the language of the law with
that of the statement of the under
taker. Movements of Steamships.

PRESIDENT WILSON, SENATOR
STONE AND REP. FLOOD
ALL REMAIN RETICENT
Word Expected Today Indicating
Germany's Reception of U. S. Atti
tude on Armed Merchantmen.
Washington, Feb. 21. President
Wilson held a long conference on for
eign affairs at the White House to
night with Senator Stone and Repre
sentative Flood, chairman of the con
gressional foreign affairs committee.
Birthday of
Most fittingly returns this day
While rivulet and rill
Aimd the hoary hills away,
Or down in dells so still
Now freed are greeting rays that bring
Glad tidings of the coming spring.
For he whose very name alway
Wins welcome gratefully,
Suggesting fadeless leaves of bay,
Broke icy tyranny
Surely as soon yon sun will break
The ice-king's, and new life awake.
Yet the day needs no help of flowers,
Nor buds eager to bloom,
With bright portent of fragrant bowers
Beside a wintry tomb,
If myriad flags lend tribute true
In tints of red, and white, and blue.
Even if from a leaden sky,
-Though smilirg drearily,
Should snowflakes fall afar and nigh
Tipping each shrub and tree,
Heaven blesses, through a rite thus done,
The birthday of 'our Washington.
w. E. BOIES.
and Senator Kern, majority leader of
the senate. When the callers lert al
ter a stay of more than an hour they
declined to talk and White House of
ficials were equally reticent.
Gravity of the Situation.
Attentive interest attached to the
conference because of the admitted
gravity of the situation between the
United States and Germany and Aus
tria-Hungary, resulting from the re
cent notice of the Teutonic allies that
after March 1st, all armed enemy
merchantmen would be attacked with
out warning.
While he was at the White House,
Secretary Lansing's secretary deliv
ered to him a letter understood to
contain information to be embodied
in a speech on foreign relations Sen
ator Stone plans to deliver in the sen
ate later this week.
Erroneous Impressions.
Administration leaders resent what
they believe erroneous impressions re
garding recent negotiations over sub
marine warfare which have gained
circulation recently and it is under
stood Senator Stone will be entrusted
with the task of making the adminis
tration position clear. There is par
ticular objection to reports that the
United States changed its position to
ward the arming of merchantmen for
defensive purposes when the Lusi
tanla case apparently was virtually
settled. One member of the senate
foreign relations committee stated to
night that many senators favored the
passage of a resolution warning
Americans to keep off armed ships,
but Senator Stone denied flatly that
such a step had been mentioned at
the conference.
Word from Berlin Today.
Word is expected from Berlin to
morrow or Wednesday indicating Ger
many's reception of the attitude of
the United States toward the arming
of merchantmen. Count Von Bern
storff has informed his government
that the United States will not accept
settlement of the Lusitanla case un
less Germany specifically states that
previous assurances that liners will
not be attacked without warning are
not changed by the recent notice re
garding armed merchantmen.

Graft Charge for
a Chicago Woman
MRS. LOUISE OSBORNE ROWE OF
PUBLIC WELFARE BUREAU
UNDER CHARITY GUISE
It is Alleged She Exacted Payment of
Subordinates Under Threat of Dis
missalGot at Least $500 From One.
Chicago, Feb. 21. A sensational alle
gation of graft was made today by
Alderman 'William E. Rodriguez, who
asserted that Mrs. Page Waller Eaton,
lecturer, author and head of the bu
reau of social survey under Mrs.
Washington
Louise Osborne Rowe, commissioner
of the bureau of public welfare, had
been compelled for months to pay over
approximately one-third of her salary
to 'Mrs. Rowe.
The payments, it was alleged, were
always made in cash and were said
to be for the benefit of a needy rela
tive of Mayor William Hall Thomp
son. The charges were made at a com
mittee meeting of the city council and
an investigation demanded.
Paid More Than $500.
"In order to protect herself after
the demands for money were made
last Juno," Alderman Rodriguez said,
Mrs. Eaton went to per lawyer, Sey
mour Stedman. After conferring with
him he called me in. I advised her to
ask for a council investigation. She
declared, however, that debts which
were pressing her made her fear for
the loss of her position. She decided
to continue making the payments. I
am told she paid more than $&O0 to
Mrs. Rowe. The payments were made,
she told me, in installments of $43
paid twice a month. The last pay
ment was made Jan. 4. At that time
she refused to pay more. She resign
ed last Saturday."
Asked to whom the money was
turned over by Mrs. Rowe, Alderman
Rodriguez said :
Refused to Take Check.
"According to the story the money
was to go for the support of a needy
relative of Mayor Thompson, a wid
ow, I am told. I saw the payment
made to Mrs. Kowe on June Zs last
year," continued the alderman. "Mrs.
Eaton attempted to make the pay
ments in the form of a check but Mrs.
Rowe refused to accept them. After
this refusal Mrs. Eaton drew a per
sonal check, took it to the bank and
cashed it and put the money in a
marked envelope. To identify the
check she wrote on the back of it 'For
the Louise Osborne Rowe charitable
fund. She took this money, I believe
there was $43 in that payment, in the
marked envelope to Commissioner
Rowe. I stepped into the room just
behind Mrs. Eaton and saw her hand
the envelope to Mrs. Rowe, who re
ceived it without comment,"
