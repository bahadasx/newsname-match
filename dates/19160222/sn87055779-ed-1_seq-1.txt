VER TELEPHONE
Says He is Going to Leave
New York Will Kill Every
Roman Catholic.
Intern.itien:i News Service:
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 2. Search
for Jean Crones, the anarchist who
attempted to poison the guests at the
banquet to Archbishop Mundelein in
Chicago, was renewed in lloston and
other New England cities last night
and today, as a result of a taunting
telephone message received by the
telephone operator of a local news-
j paper from a man who declared he
j was Crones.
j The operator heard a man's voice
i in broken English saying:
"I am Jean Crones."
The operator, pretending she did
not understand, repeated her "hello"
meanwhile rushing through an
emergency call to police headquar-
i ters on another line and on a third
! line begging the telephone company
! to trace the call before 'Crones'
! could break the conection.
"I am Jean Crones," came the
voice.
"pell it," replied" the operator,
i sparring Jor time.
"Jean C-r-o-n-e-s, Crones," the
voice spelled out. Then in the rapid,
tjueerly accented way that made it
tliflicult to understand clearly just
what he was saying, rattled on, '"the
Chicago polic" are after me; I am
on my way to J itchburg and will
kill every Loman Catholic 1 meet."
Then the click over the wire told
that "Crones" had hastily hung up,
j breaking the connection.
I On account of the hurried way in ;
I which the man spoke and because of
t
j the queer accent the operator was
uncertain whether the man said
"Fitchburg" or "Langor." She was
positive, however, that it was either
Pitchburg or Langor.

and its crew of öu men were killed.
Destruction of the baloon, while
it was passing over the allied lines,
apparently on Its way to attack

The zeppelin, with all its lights
extinguished, was sighted at S:30
o'clock last night, flying against the
wind. It was at an altitude of 6,000
feet and the French immediately
opened tire with anti-aircraft guns.
In the glare of illuminating shells
the gunners kept at their task and
soon the balloon was set on tire.
Flames from the incendiary shell
raced along the gas bag and soon
the entire structure was a liery
mass. The balloon began to descend
very slowly with piece.-? of burning
wood and silk dropping from it.
When the flames reached the car
there was a terrific, explosion and
the balloon was torn asunder. As
the aircraft was split, apart the
wreckage began dropping at frightful
speed and the men could be seen
amidst the flames trying to throw
the remaining bombs from the car.
There was a series of other explo
s1 ins l ef dre '.he remnants of the bal
loon reached the ground.
Thirty bodies, including an officer,
were found in the ruins.
Fach was blackened with fire and
the clothing had been burned fron
all the corpses. The zeppelin was
one of the nev. st and biggest type.
