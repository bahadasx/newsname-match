KNOW HUMAN NATURE, HK URGES
Dr. c. A. Ellxxood I.ajs Down Require
ments for Success in Business.
"Success in business and in industry
depends not so much on one's adjust
ment to tilings as on his adjustment
to the human world. It is the power
of udaplirg oi.e's self to the people
with whom one works that determines
success 11,1 it- ti'iin does the manipu
lation of tilings. We must learn that
human nature demands justice, fair
ness, l'beity, understanding and sym
pathy." This was tiie final thought of Dr.
C. A. F-llueod't, talk before the Ad
point Clnb at the open meeting in
Suitlor I tail last night. His sub
ject was "Human Nat re in Busi
ness" "Business is the largest single phase
of social life," lie said, "and we all
stand in some relation to it. It is
commonly said that business as it is
now conducted is a disgrace, and the
fault is generally laid at the door of
human nature, meaning by that term
the sum of what Is born within us.
The first premise is that all men are
selfish and that the basis of business
is selfibh interest. This is a mere
tradition; it takes no account of Hie
fact that man is also possessed of
altruistic interests.
"I doubt that any business can suc
ceed in a large sense by disregarding
the rights of others. It is possible
to conduct business on a basis of ser
vice, for though many men have
failetl in conducting business by eth
ical methods, many have succeeded.
There arc many men who considered
other ihings than self-interest in Hie
conduct of their business."
Doctor Ell wood also took up Hie
instinct of workmanship, the satisfac
tion in a piece of work rightly done.
"This instinct," he said, "must be de
veloped. It is no longer thought pos
sible to acquire specific ability
through general study, but it is known
that the capacity of the human mind
for forming habits is almost unlim
ited. True, one's natural abilities fit
him l.est for certain habits, and it is
highly important that the business
man should discover both his own
special aptitude and those of his em
ployes This capacity is one of the
most h ipeful things in the whole bus
iness and social life of the world."

SPEAKER ATTACKS
"SCABEDNESS" PLANS
Prof. A. W. Taylor Sees
Danger in the Movement
for Preparedness.
PERIL IN HYSTERIA
Even Wilson, Me Says, Lost
His Head in Declaring
for Greatest Navy.
The danger of waste, the peril or
hysteria, the loss of our opportunity to
become the leaders and moulders of
an international peace program, the
possibility of becoming suspicious of
nnou'ending powers these are the dan
ger points of preparedness, according
to Prof. A. W. Taylor of the Bible Col
lege. Professor Taylor addressed the
Y. M. C. A. Forum last night on "Dan
ger PoUits in the Preparedness Pro
gram." "I do not belong to the peace-at-any-price
party," declared Professor Tay
lor. "In fact, I do not know any one
who does. It seems to me that the
phrase is a cry raised by those who are
seeking to hide their own selfish aims.
There are many worse things than to
die. Dishonor is worse than death.
Dishonor of a nation is worse than
war. But what do we mean by dis
honor? Every cause that is fought
claims that it is a fight against dis
honor. Tiie weakness of President
Wilson's addresses is that he never
was speclie about the issue but talked
of the honor of the nation."
Professor Taylor also deplored the
attempt to embroil the United States in
the European "balance of power pro
gram," which he declared was as much
responsible for the present war as any
other cause. He attacked the gross
waste connected with our military ex
penditures and pointed out that
though we already spend almost as
much as Germany, we are said to be
at the mercy of Germany or Japan.
Professor Taylor dwelt with emphasis
on the psychological phase of present
"scaredness" situation. He pointed out
the danger of giving way to a national
wave of hysteria and cited Colonel
Roosevelt as an example of oue who
had become a victim of mob psycholo
gy. "Even President Wilson lost his
head before the great crowd which
thronged to see and hear him at St.
Louis, when he said that he wanted the
greatest navy in the world," said Pro
fessor Taylor. "Remember that none
of us is so masterful that he cannot be
swept off Ills feet by a great wave of
national suggestion."
BARS I'Oll BALDRIDGE AT 1
M.
Bond for Former Officer Has Xot Been
Raised So Far.
At 1 o'clock this afternoon W. II.
Baldridge, former Centralia marshal,
who is charged with first degree mur
der, was in the county jail. Yester
day Baldridge told a Missourian re
porter that he would be out on bond
today. Apparently the efforts of his
brother, B. H. Baldridge of Kansas
City, and his attorneys to get the
$:i,000 bond have been unsuccessful.
At the courthouse ,today no one
knew whether Baldridge's bond would
be raised. W. M. Dinwiddle, prose
cuting attorney, said that Hie person
before whom application ' for bond is
made will decide Hie amount. J. E.
Boggs, circuit clerk, to whom appli
cation will be made, said that offi
cially he knew nothing of Hie case.

W.J.SHEPARD PLEADS
FOB NEVVPAJRIOTISWI
Professor Warns Assembly
Against too Servile Ad
herence to Tradition.
TAKES UP THE WAR
Washington Birthday Speak
er Would Face Problems
in Modern Way.
Surrounded by American Hags, her
alded by martial music and speaking
before more cadets than - as President
A. Boss Hill said ever had been en
rolled at West Point, W. J. Shepard,
professor of political science and pub
lic law in the University, this morning
made a plea for the abandonment by
Hie United Slates of a too servile ad
herens :o the political ideas of the
patriot fathers as expressed in the
Declaration of Independence, the bills
of rights, federal and state constitu
tions and Washington's farewell ad
dress Professor Shepard addressed the
Washington Birthday Assembly of the
University. His subject was "The Tra
ditions of the Fathers."
"In attacking the vital problems of
the present," he said "to allow Hie
dead hand of tradition to control is to
place the form above the spirit, to bow
the knee to the authority of an ut
tered phrase, while renouncing that
independence of judgment, that virile,
self-reliant attitude of mind which so
signally characterized the men we
honor as the Fai tiers.''
Unions Career of Washington.
Professor Shepard reviewed the pub
lic career of Washington. . The War
of Independence was justified by the
ideals of radical democracy, he held,
but while these theories served their
purpose by achieving practical politi
cal ends, "they are for our present
needs totally useless and indeed per
nicious, for they befuddle public opin
ion and clog the course of govern
mental action.
"Is it self-evident that the ignorant
the perverted, the criminal members
of the community are entitled to equal
rights in the government with the in
telligent, the honost, the upright?" he
demanded.
The state, according to Professor
Shepard, instead of being a govern
ment by consent, based on implied con
tract, "is a natural institution, resting,
like Hie family, upon fundamental hu
man needs." The support of Congress
of the bill granting independence to
the Philippines, lie explained, is based
on tliis theory of government by the
consent of the governed.
"The fundamental reason for our
non-intervention in Mexico is the set
tled idea that every people has a God-
given right to rule itseir. There is a
higher and truer idealism than that
embodied in the traditions of Hie Fath
ers. It is the idealism of national
helpfulness, national service, national
duty."
Washington's Neutrality Commended.
Washington was commended for his
strict enforcement of neutrality at a
time when many of the people, as at
Hie present time, enlisted their sym
pathies on one side or the other. We
have a new friendly relation with
Great Britain, Professor Shepard
holds, and it would be advisable for
us to form a defensive alliance.
Referring to Hie present military
preparations in this country, the
speaker said: "That the dangers are
real we have Hie testimony of the high
est military and naval authorities; we
have Hie evidence which a union of
Republicans and Democrats In Con-
gres most forcibly presents; we have
the word of the President of Hie Unit
ed States himself. Why not admit that
we are a world power and play the
part in a strong and forceful fashion?"
On the main floor this morning all
but the last three rows of seats were
reserved for the cadets. Seats were
reserved on the main lloor for the
members of the D. A. It.
C. IS. Rollins represented the Board
of Curators on the platform with Pres
ident Hill and Professor Shepard.

WASHINGTON THE MAN.
If we had known you as a Common
Soul,
Had seen you in the morning 'fore
your shave,
Without your manner grand and calm,
your scroll
Upon the mantel shelf; or misbehave
Because your biscuits turned out
wrong, or rave
Because Hie coffee wasn't done on time,
Had heard you stutter in an effort
brave
To speak the truth in cherry blossom
time
Father of Our Country, would you
seem less sublime?

BEKMN, Feb. 22. Nowhere in Ber
