WASHINGTON. 1'eli. 21.-National '
preparedness took a long step for- '
ward in congress today when the '
house military committee reached a '
practical agreement or. the outline of
the army hill it will unanimously pre-j
sent for passage, chairman Hay was:
ni'thtiris'eil to frame the measure, i
which is a compromise for the con- '.
linental army plan advocated by,
former Secretary Harrison and Ptesi-
dent Wilson. !
Complete federalization of the Xa- '
tionai '.'.nnrd will he substituted for
the proposed continentals-', and the
White House was informed during the
day that the committee was a unit ir:
supporting the plan, only the lan
guage and minor details remaining to
be worked out. The measure wil!
grant virtually the entire program
mapped out by Secretary Garrison for
the regular array and go even further
than he recommends in providing for
reserve military supplies. A total
peace strength of ".".,000 men in the
Handing army and the guard com
bined will be provided for, with re
serve systems to more than double
i haf force in war.
The expense for the whole estab
lishment this year is roughly estimat
ed nt $ 1 74.0HI1 .no i. exclusive of Pana
ma Canal defenses, carried in another
bill, proposals for additional military
schools in all states, carried in the
.McK'ell-ir bill favorably reported today
by the committee with an appropria
tion of i:!,4H,iino for this purpose and
whatever may later be decided upon
in carrying out a scneme io jomci
the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen
in the I'nited Stale:, giving the coun
uy its own supply of ingredients for
explosives. The first rear of the Gar
rivoi' plan would have ca'led for a to
tal expenditure of $lS2.00O.0o0.
Whether the new bill will be accept
able to President Wilson has not heer.
indicated, but the committee believes
its plan will override every objection
lo the substitution of the national
guard for the continentals and that
congress has full legal authority for
its accomplishment.
To complete the committee's com
promise with President Wilson on
the continental army, the bill will
authorize the increase of the tegular
i.i my to a total peace strength ot
1 17,000 hy adding ten regiments of In

the state departmen today that the
liritish authorities continued to use
the vessels without the formality of
a prize court proceedings, despite
surances to the American government
that the cases would be adjudicated
as soon as possible.
It was explained that the Kankakee
had been sent from Montevideo to
Alarseilles, France, and then to the
northern coast of Africa for a cargo
of iron ore destined for Liverpool.
Great P.ritain's reply to the .Ameri
can protest againsti the requisitioning!
ot the Kankakee and her 'despatch to j
Marseilles had been received at the
state department. It says in etrect
that the vessel was sent to that port
at the request of the owners of her
cargo of coal, who wished it delivered
there. No reply, however, has been
received to the second inquiry as to
why the Kankakee was sent to Af
rica. In both instance's, it 'was said,
the vessel was used after the attor

NEW YoIlK, Feb. 21. Former Pres
ident Willam Howard Taft. in an ad
dress here tonight at the Tenth annual
banquet of the Traffic Club of New
York, declared that the railroads of
the I'nited States have themselves to
blame for the "hampering regulations
With which they find themselves
emeshed."
i "They lent themselves to the building
up of industrial monopolies by the
granting of rebates against the law,"
said .Mr. Taft; "they took part in pol
itics and corrupted councils and legis
latures, and they were one of the ele
ments in the community which threat- i
ened this country' with plutocracy.
When a mild effort was made to regu
late them in the Inst interstate com-
f merce law of ISS7 the laughed at the j
law, flaunted the authority of the com
j mission, declined to present their real
difficulties in full to the commission j
ami relied on the delays in the courts,
j to defeat the purpose of the law. !
"It took people twenty years to se- j
cure the legislation needed to bring
the railroads completely under control
ill the act of PU0 and when anyone
seeks to hlame others for the enactment
of thatlegislation he is oblivious to the
I cause that made it inevitable. Rogula
tion is, therefore, here to stay, unless
a more radical step and one most de
plorable, of government ownership, is
resorted to." .
-Mr. Taft said that in recent years re
bates had almost entirely disappeared
and that a generation of railroad rcn
has come forward acquiescing in the
necessity for regulation ana eiuire.
willing to conform to its requirements.
Tie- trouble now. Air. Taft said, is not
a lack o desire on the part of the rail
road men to obey the laws, hut the
i difficulty they find in complying with
interstate commerce regulations and
Hie regulations of forty or more state
railroad commissions.
"The fact," continued Mr. Taft, "that
less mileage has been added to the
railroads in this country in new eoh
' struct ion during the last year than in
any year since the civil war in spite
of the great business that has been

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Another of Germany's big Zeppelin
airships has come to grief, and it is
probable that some if not all of its
crew perished, as it was enveloped in
flames as it fell to earth, a victim
of an enemy shell fired from a French
anti-aircraft gun.
The Paris official communication re-
ports that the airship was southward
bound from the region of St. Mene- ;
sould when the Fieuch guns at Re- J
vigny began shelling it. At last
of the missiles found its mark,
the huge aircraft took fire and
in i he vicinity of J3rabant-Le-Roi.
The Germans near Lihons, to
south of the Sommo river, have

French in an attack extending

over '
about 4 1-3 miles. The offensive I
movement was preceded by a heavy
bombardment and the clouds of as- 1
phyxiating gases. When the German
infantry endeavored to come out of
their trenches, for the attack, how- i
ever, the barrier fire and the fire of
the French riflemen stopped them i
everywhere, according to Paris.
The Germans in Artois were pre-!
vented from occupying the crater of
a mine l,v a strong counter offensive
of tlie French. In Champagne, the'
forest of t'ne Argonne, and in the en- :
tire region of Verdun, there has been ';
much artillery activity in which Paris,
claims considerable executions were,
accomplished by the F reach gunners. '
The Germans report additional re- i
pulses of British grenade attacks;
against captured positions along the
Yser canal and also the putting down'
of an entente allied offenive along :
the Pens-Aries road. i
Numerous fights in the air between
German and French aviators have
taken place. Paris reports that sec-'
eral of the German raids have been
carried out by French and liritish
aeroplane squadrons, notably em the
German aviation field at Hahsheim '
and Mitlshausen, and on a munitions'
factory at Pagny-Sur-Moselle. I'.ritish '
aircraft bombed the lown of Don !
southwest of Lille. I
There has been little fighting on .
the eastern and Ausiro-ltalian fronts. .
The Algunians fighting tor the Tea-j

would indicate that Aiistro-liungar- ,

In Asia Minor the Russians are per-
sistently following the Turks who fled
foun Krzerum, and also are pushing
their way northward from the cap
tured fortress to the Plaek sea. with
the purpose of establishing a base :
there for their warships and nans-I
ports. Pitlis on Lake Van has been
captured by the .Russians.
A Turkish power station on the Ot
