National Association of Clothiers
Makes an Appeal for Adoption
of Modest Shades.
Washington. Feb. 21. Clothing
manufacturers of the United States
are so short of dyestuffs that a na
tionwide appeal 1b to be made to the
public to recognize the fact that it
must content Itself with the simplest
colors in apparel. This was announc
ed today at the Department of Com
merce after a conference between de
partment officials and officers of the
National Association of Clothiers.
. ;.'1n spite of the fact that domestic
manufacturers of dyestuffs are now
producing more dyestuff materials
than ever before, and their output is
growing, the production is scarcely
sufficient as yet to meet more than
one-half the demand," the depart
ment's statement said, "and the
variety of colors now produced by the
domestic manufacturer is limited.
"It should be recognized for the
present that the grades of colors
which heretofore have existed univer
sally and have been demanded by the
consuming public in the United States
cannot now always be obtained, and
that In spite of every effort manufac
turers of clothing and textiles are un
able to supply the. same quality of
material .which, they furnished prior
to the European war."

Y. M. C. A. SOCIAL.
Second of Series Held Monday Even
ing With Larger Attendance.
Last evening the second monthly
members' social was held at the Y. M.
C. A. with an increased attendance
over the last one. An actual count
reported 115.
, This was the first social under the
jed N. Austin, J. Goodall Hutton,
W. H. Cone, and they exhibited
Ss. earn work in keeping things
goL Ad breaking the ladies Into
gamesith which they were not fa
milial. The dancing hour met with so much
approval before that it was repeated
last night, and the same high-class
music was furnished by Hurley's ex
cellent trio. But the games held their
own against the dancing, and every
thing was going all at once. Those,
who did not dance found a better op
portunity to bowl or play billiards or
compete in other games after the
dancing started.
The evening developed to some ex
tent into a re-union of former mem
bers, many of whom were present.
The Ladies' Auxiliary, under the di
rection of Mrs. H. M. Itltchle and
Mrs. H. A. Wilkinson christened the
new punch bowl. The patronesses
were Mrs. J. E. Burke, Mrs. H. P.
Woodman, and Mrs. E. A. Booth.

cured my boy of a severe attack of
croup after other remedies had failed.
I recommend it to everyone as we
know from our experience that it is
a wonderful remedy for coughs, colds,
croup and whooping cough." It stops

STICK TO YOUB HOME HERCHAIITS
1 he Banner to Publish Copyrighted Articles Against
Mail Older Buying
The Banner believes in sticking to
home merchants and in view of this
fact it proposes to, wage a vigorous
educational campaign against mall or
der houses upon the grounds that
mail order houses do nothing to main
tain our schools, our churches, good
roads or help the sick, the needy, and
a hundred and one other things that
home merchants have to bear. ;
The habit (because it is a habit,
pure and simple) of buying of mail or
der houses is formed on the theory
that one can buy for less money. The
idea is ' as erroneous as Aesop's
fables. One may buy a few things
cheaper of mall order houses than he
can buy at home, but they are few,
and it is a well-known fact that quali
ty is not really expected from the far
off stores of Chicago, New York, or
Philadelphia. Ninety times out of a
hundred the same goods could he
bought of the Home Merchant for the
Same Money and Often Times Less
Money if you Gave the Local Mer
chant a Chance to figure with you.
Take this joke of a grocery order
that is being solicited broadcast now
days by a certain mail order house..
They tell you they will sell you 100
pounds of sugar at a saving of one
half cent a pound if you will give
Them an Order of $10" for other Stuff.
They proceed then to load you up
with spices, pepper, baking powders,
condiments, etc, enought to last an
average housewife ten years, and up-,
on which there is a profit so large
that on the whole bill they make in
the neighborhood of $3. Now Any.

London, Feb. 22. The British House
of Commons last night passed new
votes of credit to the amount of
420,000,000. This is expected to
carry the war to the end of May,
bringing the total sum appropriated
by means of votes of credit since the
out break of the war to 2,082,000,000
a sum, according to Premier As
iuith, "not only toeyond precedent,
but actually beyond theimaglnation of
any financier of this or any other
country."
The point emphasized by Premier
Asquith was not the enormous totals
necessary for the war, but the fact
that by careful economy and safe
guards the government had succeed
ed in holding down the expenditure
well' below 5,000.000 a day, which
figure he thought unlikely to be ex
ceeded at any time.
The premier's speech was con
fined entirely to the financial aspect
of the present situation, no reference
being made to military affairs in gen
eral. Mr. Asquith told the House that
the dally expenditure from April 1 to
July 17 of last year was 2,800,000;
from July 18 to September 11, 3,500,
000; from September 12 to November
C, 4,350,00,0; from November 7 to
February 19, 1916, between 4,300,
000 and 4,400,000. Munitions for the
army and navy from April 1 last to
February 19 had cost 834,800,000,
the premier stated.

BHt Provides for Military :Traln!ng in

West Point
Washington, Feb. 21. The funda
mental features of the Army Reorganl
zation bill, one of the two major
measures of the national defense pro
gram, were agreed upon today by the
House Committee on Military Affairs.
A standing army of 135,000 men, the
Federalization of the National Guard,
the doubling of the number of cadets
at West Point, the construction of ft
Government ammunition plant, and
the creation of a reserve are the prin
cipal provisions of the measure. The
bill will come from the committees, it
is indicated, as a nonpartisan meas
ure, and will be ready for report with
in ten days. ' :
Speaker Clark's project for the as
signment of army officers to private
military schools will be Included1 In
the biil-an officer to be detailed to
instruct every unit of 400 pupils. The
bill will appropriate $260,000 for en
larging the capacity at West Point in
order that additional cadets may be
accommodated there. The House re
cently passed a bill increasing the
number of midshipmen at Annapolis.
The committee is yet to put the
Army bill into printed form, but there
was no division of sentiment regard
ing the fundamentals. Chief interest
centers in the proposed legislation af
fecting the National Guard, which is
to be a substitute for the legislation
advocated by Secretary Garrison.

FOi? COLONEL
Chairman Perkhs Says Roosevelt
Is as Popularas 1812
COMMITTEE MEETING CALLED
Progressives Who Have Returned to
Old Parties Believed to Be at
Heart Progressives.
New York, Feb. 21. Thore will be
a meeting of the Progressive national
committee in its rooms at 30 East
Forty -second street with In ten days,
it was announced today by George W.
Perkins, the national chairman. At
that meeting reports will be received
as to Progressive strength and Roose
velt sentiment from every state, and
there will be a comparison of notes as
to just how weleomely the name of
Justice Hughes is received in outly
ing Progressive districts.
Perkins Bays he has heard already
enough to Indicate . to him that
Colonel Roosevelt Is just as popular,
probably more popular, than he was
in 1912. He says the falling off in
the enrolled strength of the Progres
sive party is not especially Important,
since most of the men who have re
turned to the Republican party or to
the Democratic party go back as
Roosevelt men still, he. asserts, and
are ready to vote for the Colonel
onco more
One of the interesting '. reports re
ceived will be as to the race for gov
ernor of Louisiana that John W. Park
er is making on the Progressive
ticket. Parker, according to reports
received at the national headquarters,
has an excellent chance of being elect
ed upon his protective prosperity pre
paredness platform.
The Progressive .leaders believe
they, tove skilled effectually any such,
notion as was put forward by William
Barnes that Colonel" RooBevelt 'will
support Elihu- Root-or any other Re
publican, candidate .'who bad' a hand;
in depriving the Colcnel of the Re
publican t nomination r-ijnvl1)r2. -Perkins
says he has not heard from the
Colonel since the1 latter went to' the
,West Indies, nor. has he tried to com
municate with the Colonel, , 'biA"! he
seems quite confident everything that
has been said by the Progressive lead
era recently as to the unsatisfactory
character of the Republican state con
vention; its "reactionary" develop
ments, and so on, meets with Colonel
Roosevelt's absolute agreement.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS WON
But Recreation Basketball Five Lost
to Dalt'on.
Fourteen girls from Bennington
Journeyed to Dalton, Mass., Monday to
meet two basketball teams on the
Dalton floor and this morning they re
turned with one game lost and one
victory. The high school girls won
after a close and exciting game, by a
score of 12 to 10.. The high school
girls went onto the floor first and
matters looked rather dubious for the
local girls at the end, of . the ..first
half with the score standing 10 to G
for Dalton. '
With a general shift In the line up
for the second half, the entire team
buckled down to hard and steady play
Ing and made 2 field baskets and 2
goals, while keeping their opponents
down to a single basket.
The Recreation team played a splen
did game, although it lost to the tune
of 18 to 12. The Bennington players
were seriously handicapped 'by being
obliged to play in three courts, and
the girls did not find the basket until
the last three minutes of the first
half when they mado 3 successive
throws from the field.
The girls who went from the High
school were: Margaret Nash, Minnie
Fisher, Alice Green, Helen Carpenter,
Elsie Wahlqulst, Beulah ...Whiteley.
The Recreation girls were - Nellie
Maker,; Helen Mc Gulre, Agnes Mc
Brlde, Margaret Young, Marie Young,
Anna Fisher and Ella Sigworth. '
