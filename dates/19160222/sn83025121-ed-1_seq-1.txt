f Associated by rsdsral Wlrsisss.)
WASHINGTON, February .22 Jt
. is now taken as a practical
certainty that the authorized
peace strength of the Regular Army
will be increased by one half, giving
a total strength of "l 50,000. Both the
senate and the house plans have crys
talUed and while the increase to be
authorized in the senate measure and
that authorized in the house measure
will not agree, the compromise that
will result will raise the authorized
limit of tbo present by ut least 30,000
II1UU.
The limit set by th.e bill which the
si'uate committee on military affairs is
prepared to report plana a peace army
cf between 160,000 and 200,000 men,
tho senate minimum being higher than
the maximum to be recommended in
the bill upon Which the house com
uiit tea ha agreed.
Federal Control of MWfla,: ' -
The house bill v ill recommend a
standing army of a peaee strength of
147.000, while the bill will bring the
militia" under a large measure of fed
eral control and provide for it mem
her being drafted into tho regular
army in tho event of war. , .
A militia to consist of 425,000 men
is provided for, to be paid by the fed
tral government. The pay for the en
listed men will he at the rate of four
dollars eaoh a mouth. Second lieuten
ants will 'receive 2.r)0J year; first
lieutenant $300 a y ar: captains 500
n year and superior officer in propor
tion. The member of the house commit
tee, after securing opinions from a
niiinlier of authorities on constitutional
law, believe that the federal govern
ment has a const Jtiqtionat fight to
enact legislation that will give federal
control of the militiu in times of both
pence aud war, . ,J;; ;
It is proposed now to Vote the pow
t'i to the President to draft the militia
men into tho regular army, should, the
services of the militia be required for
war or for service under the federal
government in territory outside of the
limits of the State to which the mili
tia may belong.
It is believed that the limit of the
power over tho militia conferred by
the Constitution upon tht. governments
of the individual States is to appoint
the militia ofheer.
The legislation proposed by the house
will authorize under the pay schedules
the appointment to the militia of an
additional seven hundred and eighty-six
omVere, of the various grades. The bill
will also prohibit the right now claimed
by the militia of disbanding at choice
and will enforce certain requirement
of training in ordur to qualify the offi
cers and enlisted men for the pay to be
provided.
I'ndcr the house measure the militia
will become as much a part of the reg
ular service as was proposed for the
Continentals in the program submitted
by former 8ocretary Garrison.
Many Additional Units
Dealing with the increases to be
made iu the regular army, the measure
provides for ten additional regimeuts
of infantry, four new regiments of field
artillery, fifty-two additional companies
of count artillery, fifteen more compan
ies of engineers gad four aero squad
rons. . V:'?-i- 'r
The number of cade t West Point,
or at whatever new .military academy
may be established, is to be double the
present enrolment.. V ; 'V
The term of enlistment Id the regular
army is set by tho bill at four year,
with an additional thro years in the
first reserves, provision being made for
75,000 reservists annually and provid
lug a first reserve eventually of 225,000.
The estimated expense of the in
creased army and federalized aiilitia un
der the house measure ia announced at
171,00(1,000 for 1915, exclusive of the
expense for the maintenance of the Pa
nama Canal Zone government and de
fenses. This ia eight million dollars
less than the estimate submitted by Mr.
Garrison in his preparedness program.
Where Senate BUI Differs
It ia understood that the senate hill
parallels that Of the koua In respect to
the federalizing and pay of the militia,
the essential differences - between the
committees being in th urabr of men
to bo enlisted la the regular army.
Home or the senator favor a standing
army up to 200,000 men, the minimum
mentioned in the committee' discussion
being 1H0.000. . That congress
