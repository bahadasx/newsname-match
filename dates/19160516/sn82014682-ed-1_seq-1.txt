NEW INJUNCTION SUIT
MAY BE DEVELOPMENT
Has Offered Services Gratis to
Governor Pinkham; Again
Declares He Represents .No
. Hidden Interest; Works '-'for
Public" -
, A double-barreled fight against the
proposed new Rapid; Transit franchise
is Included in the plana of Attorney J.
A. Magoon, who leaves for Washing
ton tomorrow.
Attorney Magoon Is going to Wash
ington primarily on a land suit, which
has reached th United Statea su
preme court, but while In the national
capital he hopes to get a hearing be
fore the house committee on territo
ries, at which he will oppose any new
Rapid Transit charter at the present
lme.
The second barrel of his gun is
loaded with an Injunction suit to be
fought out In the Hawaiian courts.
The firing of both barrels depends up
on the developments of the next few
weeks. V
If Governor Pinkham declines to ap
prove the new charter plan, as sub
mitted to him a few day ago by the
public utilltlea commission, the plan,
it la conjectured, will not reach Con
gress at all, and therefore an appear
ance before -the committee on terri
torlts may ' not seem necessary to
Attorney Magoon. ? On the other hand,
if th new charter draft or one similar
to ft meets the governor's approval
and Is sent to Congress for action at
this, sesslcnj" the attorney may-fiwr
his shot, thwand there, provided he
.is In Washington. . v '.. -.' '
'f Ilia contemplated injunction suit
has this features: .' .'..'.'
He has offered his services gratis
to the territorial government to be
used In fighting the new charter plan
and in securing from the territorial
supreme court an Interpretation of the
"stock dividend" provisions of the
present charter.
In case the government accepts his
services he may possibly , appear be
fore the supreme court as "amicus
curiae" dn the territory's appeal of
the present Injunction 6ult, decided in
"favor of the Rapid Transit by Circuit
Judge Stuart weeks ago.
There Is a twliiiU?! question whe
ther this Injunction suit, which is now
before the supreme court, covers the
points on which Magoon verbally and
In letters to the Star-Bulletin has re
cently been attacking the present
'franchise. i .
If It should develop that these points
cannot be brought before the supreme
court for decision in connection with
the existing litigation, Attorney Ma
goon is determined to start an In
junction suit " In the circuit court
which 8hall cover his points, and car
- ry it' through to supreme court inter-
pretatlon. '
He holds, briefly, that the Rapid
Transit has not the right to. issue
stock dividends on the basis of profits
put back Into enlargements and im-
provement8 of the system, and there
fore that much of - the present and
' contemplated capital stock issuance is
; illegal and the stock worthless,
Represents Only Himself and Public
Mr. Magoon declared emphatically
i n gain today that he represents in his
attitude no person oi interest other
' than the public and public Interest,
and that he is retained by no one.
-The report that Link McCandless
: has retained my services Is unfair
und untrue " he aald today.
I am do-
Ing this from what I conceive Is my
I duty solely as a citizen of Honolulu.
I am not hostile to the Rapid Transit
Company or any member of the cor
v poration., I am under obligations to
some of the large stock-holders and
they are my personal friends. But I
contend that this stock bonus or stock
dividend plan is Illegal and wrong,
and that we sheuld have a supreme
court decision on it.
The Rapid Transit attorneys say
that the present salt doeB not . bring
this qoesuon oeiore ine supreme
. court If that Is the caie. it should be
brought before the, court by another
suit. I am willing to Join as a pri
vate citizen with a group of citizens
to test this out. and I am assured of
the support of a huridredyes, a thou
sand lionoluians to see it through.
Attorney Magoon has offered his
services to Governor Pinkham to as
sist In getting the matter before the
supreme court.. He said this morning
that the fcffer was verba'lly made.
Whether It will be accepted he does
ont know.
But he indicated unmistakably this
morning that he Is In for a long fight
against a new Rapid Transit charter,
if a long fight is necessary, and he
expressed no doubt that he could make
the fight an Interesting one.
From his comments rl would appear
that the new charter Is likely to be
Indefinitely held up by litigation.

wrong?
2. Was it a part of Jesus policy to
restrain the evildoer?
3. Is the maintenance of an ade
quate police force at all out of har

tise? 4. What is the first thing to deter
mine with reference to every crimi
nal? What do we look for when a
man is sick?
5. What should be our aim in the
treatment of criminals?
6. Are reform methods in al!
prisons practical?
7. Where should we begin our re
form, after crime is committed or be

Stirred by sympathy for the German

today that only his general sympathy
for humanity has led him to the work.
He says he would do the same for
America should she become involved

"I first became Interested in the
German cause through reading a pa

help them, and to persuade other Chi
