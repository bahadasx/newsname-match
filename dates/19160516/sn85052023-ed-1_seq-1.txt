SAD DEATH
IN WEST END
Mrs. Carlisle Alcorn, Young Wife
And Mother, Succumbs to Bi
chloride of Mercury Poison
One of the saddest deaths in the
West End of Lincoln county in many
years was that of Mrs. Carlisle Al
corn, which took place last Saturday
shortly after noon as a result, of bi
chloride of mercury poisoning. Mrs.
Alcorn was the wife of the only son
of Dr. Edward Alcorn, and was a
beautiful and attractive young wom
an, just 24 years of age. She had
been in ill health for some time, how
ever, having become affected with
malaria at her husband's home in Bo
galusa, Louisiana. She came north
with her eight-months-old son a few
weeks ago, in an effort to regain her
health, but her spirits seemed de
pressed and she became a victim of
melancholia.
Mr. Alcorn was in the south and
was summoned by wire. He was
almost prostrated with grief and was
utterly unable to understand the
cause of the fearful blow which had
been visited upon him and his little
son. He and his wife had been mar
ried but a few years. She was a
Missouri girl and they were married
while he was stationed in Oklahoma.
Her parents, who were named Bry
dia, are both dead. She is survived
by several brothers of her blood kin.
She was beloved by her husband's
people as one of them, and every
thing that loving hands and tender
hearts could possibly do for her was
done for her in her illness, and to
make her life happy. She and her
father-in-law, Dr. Alcorn, had plan
ned to leave for Chicago this week
to visit one of her brothers. When
her unfortunate condition was dis
covered Saturday shortly belore noon
urnc invoked
was conscious almost to the last, ine
end came about two o'clock Satur
day afternoon.
Funeral services were conducted
at Hustonville Monday by Rev A. H.
Baugh in the presence of ahost of
friends and loved ones of this popu
lar and prominent family, who have
the sincerest sympathy of everyone
in their hour of bereavement. The
interment was in the Hustonville
cemetery.

They prized the cash drawer open

Congressman Harvey Helm
The long, continued control of the
Federal Government by the Republi
can party resulted in the wanton
and unbridled license of the Inter
ests, accentuatediby Cannonism. and
finally culminated in the revolt of
the Progressive clement of that party
The entry of tpe democratic partv

fective and aggressive reforms

that are soon , to be judged by the
American people Among the meas
ures that have -been enacted by the
democratic congr.ess during the Wil
son administration and that have
rendered it the best asset of th,e dem
ocratic party in ogr state and nation,
are: ft
The constitutional amendment
providing for thejopular election of
the United Stat Senate, whereby
the people are gifpn control of that
body instead of the, trusts and monop

Act, which tookjsontrol of credit

adequate appropriations for the erad

Parcels Post that furnishes the pro
ducers the best and cheapest deliv
ery wagons to the largest markets
at the highest prices; and a rehabil
itated merchant marine that will
again place the American flag on the
ocean trade lanes' of the world. The
fruition of this legislation is the most
unparalleled properity with which
any administration was ever crown
ed. The administration has, so far,
preserved peace with the world, un
der the most exasperating and trying
circumstances. It inherited an un
prepared army and navy from the
Republican party that had been in
almost continous control of the Fed-
eral Government since the Civil war,
both of which it has promptly reor-
ganized in accordance with the rea
sonable demands of the situation,
and at the same time has entered in
to peace treaties with twenty six na
tions of the world.
As one who has contributed a mod
est share to this program, by re
maining constantly on the job and
consistently aiding in putting
through democratic congresses all
the foregoing wholesome legislation,
I confidently submit my candidacy
for renomination for representative
of the Eighth Kentucky district in the
Sixty Fifth Congress to the demo
cratic voters of this district, believ
ing that those who endorse and ap
prove the record as, in part, set out
will not rebuke those who have con
tributed in however slight a degree
to its accomplishment. My experi
ence, especially, in these critical
times, should be an asset rather
than a liability.
I had hoped, in view of tho recent
small democratic majorities in our
district and state, that the demo
crats might profit by the get-together
movement now on among the
common enemy to tne end tnac vote
losing contests witmn the patty
might be avoided, and vuv state be
more certainly placed in the demo
cratic column in the coming Novem
ber election, when a most desperate
effort will be made oy a reunited
political enemy to capture control
of the Federal Government.
The small democratic majority in
the House necessitates my presence
in Washington as much as possible,
and for the presents I am compelled

LINCOLN MEN
KILLED IN SOUTH
Two Former East Endcrs Meet
Untimely Death When Auto
Crashes Into Them
Two former Lincoln county men,
James Broughton and Wm. M. Chap
pell, his son-in-law, met death near
Delray, Florida, last Friday, without
warning, and in fearful manner. But
meagre details have been received
about the tragedy, but according to
reports from there, they were driv
ing in a pony cart when an automo
bile coming toward them became un
manageable from some reason and
crashed into them. Both men sus
tained injuries from which they died
almost instantly.
News of their death caused general
sorrow in the East End where both
were well known and had a host of
friends. Only a few months ago they
moved from the section south of
Crab Orchard, to Florida to make
their home. Both have many rela
tives in the eastern section of Lincoln
and many friends and loved ones.
The remains will be brought back,
so it is understood, to their old home
and be laid to rest in the Ephesus
cemetery, Wednesday.

ville Monday soliciting premiums for
the fair and advertisements for the
fair catalogue. The K. P. fair at
Stanford has made a record during
the past few years of being the best
country- fair in this section of the
state, and it's no trouble to convince
1 1 i 1 J-

CAUGHT IN THE ACT
Albert Jones Had Seven Fat Hens
In Sack When Arrested.
Albert Jones, a well known negro
about town, was arrested Saturday
night, crawling out of a hole he had
made in T. K. Tudor's chicken pens.
In a sack he had seven fat hens.
Chief of Police Carter accompanied
by Will Hocker and Bud Hiatt, did
a little nice detective work on this
job, and when Jones emerged from
the hen house, he found Mr. Hiatt in
front of him with a big "forty-eleven"
pointing him right in the eye.
Jones tried to make an excuse but
Mr. Hiatt could not be easily con
vinced, and later Jones started to
show fight, but was soon quelled. He
faces a nice long trip to Frankfort
as chicken stealing has long been a
penitentiary offense where as much
as $2 worth of birds are "lifted."

The Q. & C. railroad has opened
negotiations in Danville for the pur
chase of about 400 acres of land
close to that city for the enlarge
ment of its yards and division ter
minal facilities.
Horace Baker, general manager of
the Q ic C, and Cutir Daugherty,
chief engineer, who were in Dan
ville lait week, announced that the
company will make extensive im
provements at lar.ville if the nec
essary lands can be purchased at a
reasonable price. The proposed Im
provements include the enlargement
of the yards, the erection of a fire
proof division headquarters, building

Quisenberry, two-thirds of the farm
of C. M. Fackler, and 125 acres of
land held by Mitchell Taylor, and six
acres included in the Haydon and
Evans properties close to Danville,
and also a part of the tract occupied
by the Danville Ice & Coal Co.
It is reported in Danville that
should the railroad company be un
able to secure the lands it needs for
its development plan that the divi
sion headquarters will be moved else
where and a movement is on foot in
Danville to give the railroad the co
operation of the Danville Commercial
Club in securing options.
In regard to Col. Evans' property
the Danville Advocate said last week:
"Col. Evans forever showed to the
people of Danville yesterday his loy
alty,! public spiritedness and love for
tne rignt oi way xnrougn nis iarm
would be donated outright up to a
certain point on his frontage. As
Col. Evans' farm is to be more se
riously damaged than any other prop
erty save that of the Danville Ice
& Coal Company, he cannot be too
highly commended for his liberal
spirit. Every property owner and
every business man in the town of
Danville, and every farmer in the
county owes him a debt of grati
tude that can never be repaid."

STANFORD BOY
INDIVIDUAL STAR
Of Interscholastic High School Ath
letic Tournament At Lexington
and Wins Cup
Sam J. Embry, Jr., of the Stan
ford High School, prbved himself
the individual star of the Interscho
lastic high school tournament con
ducted under the auspices of Stats
University at Lexington Saturday.
Young Embry scored the highest
number of points made by any indi
vidual athlete competing in the
tournament, and was awarded a
handsome cup. He scored 'two firsts
and a second. His brother, Joe T.
Embry, Jr., also made a splendid
showing. These boys with Stith Noe
were the only contestants from
Stanford High School in the athletic
events. Miss Anna Katherine Mh
theny won second prize in the girls
i-eading contest, and many thought
she should have had first. A number
! of high schools in this section com
peted. Supt. J. V. Ireland had a
large number of entries from his
Bellevue High School, and they made
a good showing in the field events.
Much criticism was heard because
the judges chosen in the events
other than athletic were all from
Lexington. Prof. Ireland, who has a
habit of "speaking out in meeting."
when things do not go right, had no
hesitancy in telling the promoters
of the injustice which had been done
other schools because of this, and of
decisions which the judges had given
which were palpable favoritism to
ward Lexington. The athletic events
and the winners were as follows:
Louisville won the meet and the
permanent possession of the silver
loving cup with fifty points. Lexing
ton was second with thirty points,
and Bellevue was a close third with
twenty-seven points. Herold, of Bel
levue, won the second individual hon
ors with two firsts.

MERCER MAN A HERO
Lee Bissett, a well-known farmer
of Mercer county, was the hero in a
rescue from drowning of Mrs. R.
Duncan and her two children. Mr.
Bissett was fishing near Mundy's
Landing, on the Kentucky river,
when a little child of Mrs. Duncan
fell into the water. Mrs. Duncan, who
was holding her other child in her
arms, put the little one on tne Dianw
and plunged into the stream. While
she was endeavoring to rescue the
older child the young one also roll
ed into the river, and soon the mo
ther and the two little ones were
struggling in the stream. Bissett
plunged into the river, and after
much difficulty succeeded in bring
ing the mother and her two children
to shore in safety. Mr. Bissett is a
brother of Commander Bissett of the
United States navy and of Capt. Bis
sett of the nary retired, who com
manded a gunboat at the battle of
Santiago.

George Bernard Shaw says the
Irish leaders were shot in cold blood
and that England had no right to
execute them.
Best Thing for a Bilious Attack
On account of my confinement in
the printing office I have for years
been a chronic sufferer from indiges
tion and liver trouble. A few weeks
ago I had an attack that was so se
vere that I was not able to go to the
case for two days. Failing to get any
relief from any other treatment, I
took three of Chamberlain's Tablets
and the next day I felt like a new
man," writes H. C. Bailey, Editor
Carolina News, Chapin, S. C. Ob-
1 tainable everywhere.
