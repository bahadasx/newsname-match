THIS LED TO DISCOVERY
OF SIR ROGER CASEMENT
No Question of Casement's
Guilt the Only One Being
His Punishment .
By Wilbur S. Forrest
(United Presg 'Staff correspondent.)
London, May 10. John McCarthy, a
Kerry farmer, upset the plans which
Berlin had carefully been laying for
months with the object of having Sir
Koger Casement 'a rebellion sweep Ire
lnnd. This fact was brought out to
day in Casement's preliminary hearing
on a treason charge. McCarthy, and
not the secret service, caused the
I night's capture.
McCarthy was called to the witness
etnnd and spoke with such a rich brogue
that tho court and spectators had dif
ficulty in understanding him. His st!rry
Tivaled fiction. On the morning of
Good Friday, he testified, ho was walk
ing on tho const rear Tralee when he
noticed a small boat floating townrd the
ehore. Ho also observed fresh foot
prints in the sand.
His suspicions being aroused, he no
tified the army barrack. Officers were
assigned to investigate.
At this point Sergeant Heme took up
the story. He said that police scattered
along the coast and found Casement in
on old fort.
Sir Roger, snid Heme, protested
Against his arrest, claiming to be Rich
ard Morton, an author. Nevertheless he
v.as tnken to the barracks after having
dropped a paper containing the phrase:
" Await? further instructions. Have de
cided to stay. Further ammunition, rif
les needed. Send another ship."
Sergeant James Butler esorted Case
ment to the Dublin train, where, he tes
tified, Sir Roger broke down and sob
bed when informed that his two con
federates had been drowned.
Scotland Yards Inspector Cock testi
fied that Casement admitted his identi
ty at the London railway station.
Constable Reilly actually arrested
Casement. He testified that upon search
ing his prisoner lie found a German
memorandum covering Casement's re
cent travels in Germany.
Martin Collins, a lad driving a pony
cart whili officers commandeered to
d ivo Casement to Tralee, identified the
defendant.
Sidney Wnghoner, the last crown
y itness to be heard before court ad
journed until tomorrow, was a signal
man aboard the British warship which
overhauled the German auxiliary accom
panying the submarine conveving Case
ment to Ireland.
He testified that he hailed the Ger
man and received an unsatisfactory re
sponse, whereupon he ordered the auxil
iary to proceed toward Queonstov.-n. The
Germans, lie swore, scuttled their ves
sel, donned Oermein navaj luniforms
nnd took to tho lifeboats. Then they
surrendered.

Old Building at Akron,
Used As Restaurant
Akron, Ohio, May 16 Four men, four
women and a little girl were dead and
20 were injured today ns the result of n
building collapsing here last night.
The old Beacon Journal structure,
now housing the Crystal restaurant, was
wrecked by four successive blasts in

walls trembled, then the roof caved in
and the entire building crumpled into
debris. Flames began leaping through
the ruins as imprisoned victims scream
ed for help.

prevented the blaze from eating up" the
bodies of the killed. A police investi
gation of the disaster was started to

Market Proves Heavy
Prices Sag Again
New York, May 10. The New York
Sun's financial reviey today said:
Irregular and somewhat reactionary
tendencies developed in the market to
day, being a not unnatural reflection of
the sharp advances of the preceding ses
sions. Heavy profit taking and dis
tribution selling were self evident both
yesterday and Saturday although offer
ings wero well taken and a large per
centage of the buying represented by
short coverings. When this was com
pleted the market merely felt back to
digest securities that had been unloaded
The rank and file of brokers offices ex
pressed disappointment at the failure of
standard issues to continue the im
provement but professionals, mainly
.responsible for the bullish activity, ex
pressed satisfaction. They pointed out
that the list, while irregular, disclosed
no structural weakness. Trifling set
backs are always attendant features of
a professional bull campaign. Prices
opened higher under tho same influences
that controlled yesterday's upward
swing nnd buying was of much the
same character.

FRANCHISE TERMS
UPHELD W OF
CITY OFWQODBURN
Judge Galloway Rules Against
Power of Public Service
' Commission
INCREASED SCHEDULE
OF RATES INVALID
Judge Holds That Franchise
Terms Must Prevail
Despite Commission
A decision that promises to be stato
wide in its influence was handed down
in department number 2 of tho cir
cuit court by Judge William Galloway
this morning when it was held that the
Public Servico commission conld not
set aside provisions of a franchise in
the Woodburn Telephone case. The
city of Woodburn granted a franchise
to the United Telephone company in
October, 1910, and one of the provis
ions under which the charter was grant
ed to the telephono compnny was a
schedulo of maximum ratos to be
charged to subscribers of the telephone
lilies. The United Telephone com
pany afterward sold out its franchise
to the Western Telephone company nnd
tho city of Woodburn brought the suit
against tho Western Telephono com
pany and the Public Service commis
sion of Oregon.
In Juno, 1015, the Western Telephone
company was granted a new schedulo
of rates by the Public Service com
mission after a hearing of both sides
i to the controversy an'd the new sched
ule of rates was from 75 cents to $1
Per month higher than the rates estab
lished by the pn-isions of tho f.rnn-
chisc. Under the terms of the fran
chise granted to tho telephone com
pany in 1910 tho ninximuin rntes were
established as follows: Ono party line
$1.50 per month: two party line $1.25
per month nnd for party lines of more
than two parties $1 per month.
The order of tho public service" com
mission dated "Jnno 10, 1015. raised
the r.tes according to the following
schedule:
Business phones: One partv line
$2.50 per month; two party lines $2.25
per month; four party line $2 per
month.
Residence phones: One party line
$2 per month; two pnrty line $1.75 per
month; four party line $1.50 per month;
extension phones 50 cents per month
extra.
Business suburban party lino $1.50
per month.
Residence suburban pnrty lino $1 per
month, Portublo or desk phones 25c
per month extra.
Fanner party lines upon which the
subscriber owns and maintains equip
ment to the city limits $0.00 per year.
The city of Woodburn filed a com
plaint asking thnt tho court set asido
the order of the commission and that
tho company bo enjoined from collect
ing tho increased rents. Judge Gallo
way's decree sots aside the order and
issues the temporary injunction.
In handing down his decree Judge
Galloway said that a franchise was
held to be n contract, and that a con
tract or its terms could not be changed
or held for naught except upon the
mutual agreement of both parties to
the contract and that tho city of Wood
burn which was ono of te original
parties to the contract objected nnd
that the public service commission
was a third parly who had no rk'ht to
set aside tho terms of tho oriirinnl con
tract. He also snid that, tho legis'a
ture had no power to tako away the
rights of cities to govern their own
affairs subject, of course, to tho crim
inal laws of tho state.
Tho life of tho franchise granted In
1010 was 25 years and it is estimated
by Attorney Blaine MeOord, who rep
resented tho city of Woodburn, that
Judge Gulloway's decision would save
tho residents of Woodburn about $10,
000 in that timo provided tho number
of telephones in Woodburn did not in
crease within the life of the franchise.
The public service commission was
represented by assistant attorney gen
eral J. O. liailey ami McNary & Mc
Nary represented tho telephono com
pany with Carey & Kerr and Griffith,
Iciter ind Allen of Portland and Clyde
It. Aitchison, of tho public service
commission. Attorney George O. Iting
ham appeared also for the city of
Woodburn. The case will be appealed
to the supreme court for final settle
ment as the public service commission
has regulated the rntes of water com
panies telephone companies nnd other
public service corporations all over
the stato and has both raised and
lowered existing rates.
