There was Jubilation among the
owners and miners at the mine of
the Waldo Copper company Monday
afternoon when the lower workings!
were drained of water and the extent
of the ore body available for Imme
diate mining was shown. For several
months the driving of tho long tun
nel has been under way, and It waa
known that upon the result ot the In
vestigation that would follow the
clearing of the workings would rest
the value of the property and would
go a Jong way in proving the dis

The Waldo mine la the property of
Dr. Reddy, A. H. Qunnell and DeWltt
VanOstrand, these gentlemen having
purchased the mine nearly a year
ago. it nao previously oeen a pro
ducer, and the new company haa
taken much ore from It during the
past year, the first carload to go over
the new railroad having come from
It. In the old workings there had
been much "underhand" sloping, the
last shipments coming from No. 3
tunnel, the underhand atoplngs go
ing to. depth of 60 feet below the
floor ht tnnnel. ' In the- four
years since the mine had been oper
ated these workings hod filled with
water, and last July the driving of
a new tunnel, No. 4, was commenced
to tap these workings from below.
This tunnel has a length of 900 feet
and a raise ot 85 feet to the point
where It cut Into the bottom of the
old stoplngs. Engineer P. W. Richard
has been In charge on the work, and
about 10 days ago the drill cut
through Into the water filled work

drill holes the water was slowly

work , had continued downward by
the former owners. Enough high
grade ore was taken from these aban
doned workings to carry on the de

CONFERENCE
ARfJY Bill
REPORTED
Oregon Senator Presents
Measure Agreed Upon as
Compromise Between Large
and Small Army Advocates
Washington, May 16. Presenting
the congressional conference report
on the army duis to tne aenata to
day, Senator Chamberlain of Oregon
said that the peace strength ot the
army would be 11,000 officers and
200,000 men under the terms of the
military measures. The army's war
strength is fixed at 11,500 officers
and 225000 men. As for the na
tional guard, its .maximum strength
is to be 17,000 officers and 440,000
men, Chamberlain asserted. In the
house, Congressman Hay denied tha
accuracy of these figures. He charged
that Chamberlain had boosted the
statistics to show that "big army
men" won in the conference dis
cussions. '
Replying to this, Chamberlain as
serted that Hay was depressing the
figures to Indicate a victory for the
"little army men." ' y : ; " . ;
"The bill Is a compromise and In
part experimental," declared Cham
berlain. "It may not work out.
Fundamentally, it is right, and It
should be welcomed by all reasonable
advocates of preparedness."
Chamberlain announced that the
volunteer army provisions had bees
stricken out and civilian training
camps substituted. The provisions
for officers of a national reserve and
a training corps were retained.
The national guard, -he pointed
out, would have a great chance to
prove the claim that it has been held
back heretofore by outside forces.
